1
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:38,375
- Beautiful! - An ideal family portrait...

2
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:40,633
Please look into the camera.

3
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:43,716
Great! How about a smile?

4
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:48,761
Let's see some happy faces. You too, Mom... Great!

5
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:52,561
Take care of your hair! There we have it.

6
00:00:52,857 --> 00:00:56,308
- That should be enough, right? - Yes, I think so.

7
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,442
- We're done with the girls. - You were so good!

8
00:01:00,752 --> 00:01:03,587
- Bye! - You were as good as gold...

9
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:08,161
How about some shots of the parents on the sofa?

10
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:12,465
Lean forward, you're sliding too far back. That's it!

11
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:18,296
- I'll try to belittle myself. - Talk to each other.

12
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:20,877
Marianne, turn your gaze slightly toward us...

13
00:01:21,174 --> 00:01:26,299
Looks like you guys like each other... I see.

14
00:01:26,596 --> 00:01:28,635
Hold that pose! Great...

15
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:31,173
- That's it. Thank you very much. - Good!

16
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:34,761
We'll need some portraits later.

17
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,060
So, let's get started, shall we?

18
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:41,981
To calm nerves, I always start with a standard question.

19
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:47,318
- I'm not particularly nervous. - Good. The question is:

20
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:50,984
How would you describe yourself in a few words?

21
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:55,365
- That's not easy. - Not so difficult, is it?

22
00:01:55,664 --> 00:01:58,700
- I might be misunderstood. - Really?

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,666
It may sound conceited when I say that I am highly intelligent, youthful,

24
00:02:02,963 --> 00:02:07,708
successful, sensible, sexy and I care about the world we live in.

25
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,884
I'm educated, well-read, and a good mixer. Let's see...

26
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:17,224
I am even a good friend to people who are worse off than me.

27
00:02:17,518 --> 00:02:22,891
I'm good at sports. I'm a good husband and a good son.

28
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,538
I have no debt and I pay my taxes.

29
00:02:25,742 --> 00:02:29,441
I respect our government no matter what it does.

30
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:33,149
I love our royal family. I left the established church.

31
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:35,240
- Should I continue? - Please.

32
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:40,492
- I'm a great lover. - Maybe we can skip that question.

33
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:43,624
And you, Marianne?

34
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,247
Well, what can I say?

35
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:53,298
I am married to Johan and have two daughters…

36
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:58,669
- That's all I can think of... - Come on, think more carefully.

37
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:05,891
- I think Johan is terribly nice... - How kind of you.

38
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:11,691
- We've been married for 10 years. - We just renewed our contract.

39
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:17,108
Unlike Johan, I lack the ability to see myself in such glowing terms,

40
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:21,320
but honestly, I'm glad I can live the life I live.

41
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:25,698
It's a good life, if you know what I mean.

42
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,948
What else? My goodness, that's difficult...

43
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:35,671
- She has a beautiful figure. - I try to be serious.

44
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:40,749
- I have two girls, Karin and Eva. - You already said that.

45
00:03:41,052 --> 00:03:45,264
How about some personal information? Let's start with your age.

46
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:49,554
- I'm 42, but I don't look it. - I'm 35.

47
00:03:49,852 --> 00:03:52,853
We both come from obscenely middle-class families.

48
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:59,184
- Johan's father is a doctor. - And my mother is the maternal type.

49
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:01,312
My father is a lawyer.

50
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:05,064
It was clear from the beginning that I would also become a lawyer.

51
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:10,572
I am the youngest of seven children. My mother ran a large household.

52
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:13,955
- These days she's taking it easy. - Oh, is she?

53
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:19,456
Curiously, we get along with our parents and see each other often.

54
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:23,965
There were never any significant frictions.

55
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:27,175
Let's talk about your jobs.

56
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:30,263
Mine is a bit unusual.

57
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:34,090
I am an associate professor at the Institute of Psychotechnology.

58
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:39,184
Family law is my specialty. I am a member of a large law firm.

59
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:42,896
Most of my work deals with divorce, but the interesting thing is…

60
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:45,231
Hold this pose!

61
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:50,439
Take a photo, I want to capture this expression. Good!

62
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:55,827
- My goodness, I feel so... - It will pass.

63
00:04:56,121 --> 00:05:00,996
- Tell me, how did you meet? - I'll leave that to Johan.

64
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:06,713
- Lord, that's interesting! - It wasn't love at first sight.

65
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:13,209
We both had a large circle of friends and often crossed paths.

66
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:16,714
We were both politically active for several years

67
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:21,760
and we did quite a lot of amateur theater as students.

68
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:26,308
Well, I can't say we made a deeper impression on each other.

69
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:28,564
Marianne thought I was arrogant.

70
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:32,945
Johan had a rather public affair with a pop singer…

71
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:37,734
...which gave him a certain image and made him unbearable.

72
00:05:38,034 --> 00:05:39,991
Marianne war 19.

73
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:43,951
She was married to a fool whose only salvation was a rich father.

74
00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:48,197
He was very nice and I was totally in love with him.

75
00:05:48,502 --> 00:05:52,713
I also got pregnant early in the relationship.

76
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:56,706
- But how did it happen that... - that we both joined forces?

77
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,378
That was actually Marianne's idea.

78
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:03,597
My baby died shortly after birth

79
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:06,975
and my husband and I divorced, much to our mutual relief.

80
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:11,183
And Johan's singer had given him notice.

81
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:14,815
We were both a little hurt and lonely,

82
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,525
So I suggested giving it a try.

83
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:23,732
We weren't in love at all, but we were both depressed.

84
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:27,569
And then we realized that we understand each other very well

85
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:31,999
and we really focused on our studies.

86
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:38,959
We moved in together, a situation that our mothers actually took calmly.

87
00:06:39,257 --> 00:06:42,542
In fact, they became good friends.

88
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:47,760
We were accepted as Johan and Marianne.

89
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:50,345
After six months we got married.

90
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:53,976
- At that point, we were already in love. - Very much so!

91
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,228
- We were considered the ideal couple. - And that's still the case.

92
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:04,353
- No complications? - We never had any material worries.

93
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:09,363
We are in good contact with friends and relatives on both sides.

94
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:13,953
We have good jobs that we enjoy. We're healthy.

95
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:20,700
And so on, to an almost vulgar extent. Security, order, loyalty...

96
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:24,621
We are almost indecently lucky.

97
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:28,836
Of course we have our differences, just like other people.

98
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:31,175
But we agree on all the important points.

99
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:34,804
- Do you never argue? - Marianne does.

100
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,931
Johan is very slow to anger, so I run out of steam.

101
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:42,597
That all sounds wonderful. All of it.

102
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:46,148
Just last night someone said

103
00:07:46,443 --> 00:07:50,856
that the very absence of problems is a serious problem.

104
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:55,367
We are well aware that a life like ours can be dangerous.

105
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,907
What do you mean by dangerous?

106
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:04,749
The world is going to hell. I claim the right to mind my own business.

107
00:08:05,043 --> 00:08:07,082
Live and let live, that is my motto.

108
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:12,041
It makes me sick to hear about the latest cure-all.

109
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:16,968
- I disagree with Johan. - So, what's your opinion?

110
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:23,383
- I believe in compassion. - Please explain.

111
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:29,853
If people have learned to care for each other in childhood,

112
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,687
the world would be a different place.

113
00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:36,769
Hold this pose! Please look into the camera.

114
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:42,444
Listen to this:

115
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:47,738
“Marianne’s eyes, blue like an old folk song, shine from within.”

116
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,706
When asked how she manages to balance work and household,

117
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:54,494
she smiles with shy joy

118
00:08:54,797 --> 00:09:00,716
"and replies that she and Johan help each other." - "That's true."

119
00:09:01,011 --> 00:09:03,003
“We understand each other,” she says, “

120
00:09:03,305 --> 00:09:06,970
brightens up as Johan sits down next to her on her heirloom sofa.

121
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:12,723
“He puts a protective arm around her and she snuggles up to him.”

122
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:16,722
- Hey! - This is the best!

123
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:21,522
"So I go and notice that they seem pleased with the prospect."

124
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:25,237
that they can be alone together again.

125
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:31,287
Two people who have matured: strong, happy and positive.

126
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:37,204
“People who never forgot to give love a place of honor.”

127
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:41,749
- We almost died when we read it. - I wanted to file a complaint.

128
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:45,584
But our mothers and daughters were simply thrilled with the article.

129
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:49,384
What really bothers me is that it doesn't say anything about my eyes.

130
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,101
- Isn't there a mysterious glow in them? - They're more like dark pools.

131
00:09:55,394 --> 00:10:01,017
- Actually, very sexy. - Katarina has a crush on you.

132
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:05,859
- Johan, do you want to run away with me? - A change would do Johan good.

133
00:10:06,154 --> 00:10:09,986
He was so good for 10 years and was never unfaithful.

134
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:13,237
Are you sure?

135
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:17,403
I believe everything Johan says.

136
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:22,866
- Did you hear that, Katarina? - Johan is a better liar than you.

137
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,289
- But I have no imagination. - That's it.

138
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:33,172
- It makes you a better liar. - Peter spices up his stories.

139
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,179
Sometimes I find it really touching.

140
00:10:35,473 --> 00:10:41,475
I read your article in Technical Times. Even I could understand it.

141
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:46,099
- Actually, Katarina wrote it. - Are you that smart?

142
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,108
I was in Germany and they wanted an article immediately.

143
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:54,487
So Katarina wrote it and read it to me on the phone.

144
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:59,693
- But why was your name on it? - That's not discrimination.

145
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:03,410
- We work together. - That's admirable.

146
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:06,376
If you knew the details, you wouldn't say that.

147
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:11,413
Things are getting a bit dicey between us. Cheers, Katarina, my darling!

148
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,043
Silly...

149
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:24,427
Do you mind if I speak freely with Johan and Marianne?

150
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,935
- What's wrong, Katarina? - Nothing. Nothing at all.

151
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:39,521
Only Peter can be so damn clumsy sometimes.

152
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,565
Clumsy is the right word...

153
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:46,651
I pride myself on being clumsy... and resourceful.

154
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:49,872
The funny thing is that according to Katarina

155
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:53,998
I'm nothing more than a spineless jellyfish.

156
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:58,707
- Jellyfish? Now you're talking. - Let's try to have fun.

157
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:03,467
Exactly, because we must not forget...

158
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:06,548
I will now give a thank you speech.

159
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:10,132
In view of the fabulous magazine article

160
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:16,104
reminds us that we are in a happy home

161
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:22,566
that we must not pollute ourselves with emotional garbage.

162
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:26,947
Cheers, Marianne!

163
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:30,325
Perhaps I don't envy your domestic happiness...

164
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:35,245
...but I envy your cooking talent.

165
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,785
No, I really mean it.

166
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:42,326
I wish Katarina would learn to cook like that.

167
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,121
Katarina is a much better cook.

168
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:50,584
- Peter says I'm poisoning the food. - It's a running joke in our house.

169
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:56,759
- Right, it's obviously a joke. - One that's seen better days.

170
00:12:57,061 --> 00:13:02,350
So, let's go into the living room and have some coffee.

171
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:06,101
So, Johan, what should I do?

172
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:09,569
I've put my foot in it again.

173
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:12,864
The girls will clear the table.

174
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:26,170
- This is all damn touching. - And what?

175
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,455
Your marriage.

176
00:13:29,756 --> 00:13:31,381
Johan and Marianne...

177
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:35,126
It can move a person to tears.

178
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:40,838
In fact, you'd really like to stick a pin into the beautiful balloon.

179
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:45,270
- Would you do that too? - Cheers to you both!

180
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:52,310
- It's been 10 years, right? - We just had our 10th anniversary.

181
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,940
- No skeletons in the closet? - You never know.

182
00:13:57,241 --> 00:14:02,614
- Both Johan and I like to tidy up. - Can you hear that, Katarina?

183
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:08,155
This is where you and I have been negligent... We never clean up.

184
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:14,877
But next week I will call Marianne and make an appointment,

185
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:18,673
so she can begin our divorce.

186
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:24,180
By the time Peter sobers up, he will have changed his mind.

187
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:28,340
Then the computer starts running.

188
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:31,893
"He says, 'I agree to the divorce.'"

189
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:36,483
“if Katarina gives up her claim to our assets in Switzerland.”

190
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:41,106
And my answer is: “But it’s my money, I earned it.”

191
00:14:41,406 --> 00:14:44,110
Then Peter will say that he has multiplied it

192
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:48,240
and I can have the whole factory.

193
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:52,866
Then I say, that’s nice of you to give me a factory in Italy –

194
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:56,831
This becomes riskier with every increase in labor costs.

195
00:14:57,128 --> 00:15:01,375
“- But Katarina, I said... – “Take the whole facility in Sweden.”

196
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:05,209
The apartment, the country house, the boat, the car,

197
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:09,555
“The stocks and the premium bonds.” Isn’t that nice?”

198
00:15:09,848 --> 00:15:13,928
I get all taxable items!

199
00:15:15,478 --> 00:15:20,721
Excuse me for talking about such trivial things,

200
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:26,184
but when Peter starts talking about the fortune, I know how drunk he is.

201
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:31,364
- And the insults aren't far-fetched. - That's what I've been saying all along.

202
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:36,952
Katarina is a businesswoman, with equal emphasis on both words.

203
00:15:37,248 --> 00:15:40,664
A businessman...

204
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:45,586
In addition, she is a brilliant artist

205
00:15:45,882 --> 00:15:50,709
and she has an IQ of I don't know what.

206
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:54,130
She is also attractive.

207
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:59,638
It is a model example and is wrapped like a gift.

208
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:04,597
How I ever had any luck with this monster of perfection is a mystery to me.

209
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:08,481
I really think we should call a taxi and go home now.

210
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:12,395
This can’t be pleasant for Johan and Marianne…

211
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:14,239
No... Johan and Marianne?

212
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:17,948
These are candy figures decorated with red ribbons.

213
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,569
Just like the marzipan pigs of our childhood.

214
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,042
It is good for their morale,

215
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:32,412
to look into the bottomless abyss of hell.

216
00:16:39,305 --> 00:16:43,634
August Strindberg

217
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:46,306
once wrote:

218
00:16:46,603 --> 00:16:50,470
“Is there anything more frightening?”

219
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:55,850
"as a man and a woman who hate each other?"

220
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:01,073
What do you think? Maybe child abuse is even worse.

221
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:07,487
But Katarina and I are children.

222
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:12,996
Deep down, Katarina is a little girl who cries

223
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:15,832
because she fell down

224
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,499
and no one comforts her.

225
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:23,635
And I haven't grown up either.

226
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:29,303
I cry because Katarina can’t love me,

227
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,052
despite my bad behavior.

228
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:35,761
There is one thing to be thankful for.

229
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:40,311
That there is nothing more hellish than this.

230
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:44,394
That's why we are ready for a divorce.

231
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:47,367
Provided you listen to reason.

232
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:50,743
Provided that we simultaneously,

233
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:53,610
in the presence of the other

234
00:17:53,914 --> 00:17:58,541
and sign all papers in front of trustworthy witnesses.

235
00:17:58,836 --> 00:18:02,619
This way, no one can rip off the other.

236
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:06,707
- We'll call you this week. - We have a great business lawyer.

237
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,593
Borglund can help you with financial arrangements.

238
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,347
What do you say?

239
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,716
Even if we agree on money matters, you will never let me go.

240
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,680
I am convinced of that.

241
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:26,314
You think you're so damn indispensable, my dear Katarina?

242
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:30,781
How did you come up with this idea?

243
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:34,489
Tell me... Tell us.

244
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:37,241
You force me to have sex,

245
00:18:37,538 --> 00:18:39,412
because you can't get an erection with other women.

246
00:18:42,918 --> 00:18:49,003
Their need for a guilty conscience knows no bounds.

247
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:56,012
Now that everything is over with Jan, you're probably panicking.

248
00:18:56,305 --> 00:19:00,350
You're stuck with old Peter.

249
00:19:00,643 --> 00:19:03,976
He has the right patience.

250
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:08,101
So you think you're the only one, right?

251
00:19:08,608 --> 00:19:11,229
How touching...

252
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:14,152
They think there are no others.

253
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:16,486
Let me tell you one thing, Peter...

254
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:19,949
Please excuse me if I am a bit blunt.

255
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:25,534
but Peter demands it and he needs to be enlightened.

256
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,287
I'll tell you this, Peter...

257
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,534
You make me so sick...

258
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,882
..in the physical sense...

259
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,837
that I would buy a fuck just to wash you out of my genitals.

260
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:47,512
“Stay with me, evening is coming quickly”

261
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:53,018
“The darkness deepens, Lord, stay with me…”

262
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:54,644
You bastard!

263
00:19:54,942 --> 00:20:01,525
“When other helpers fail and comfort disappears”

264
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:08,656
“Help the helpless, oh, stay with me.”

265
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:12,158
Whatever that means...

266
00:20:31,684 --> 00:20:34,933
I hope there are no stains on the carpet.

267
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:38,349
I don't know anything about liqueur...

268
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:40,226
Why don't you send me an invoice?

269
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:42,482
Do what I say!

270
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:52,160
Would you mind pouring me a cup of coffee?

271
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:56,198
I'm pretty drunk.

272
00:20:57,082 --> 00:21:02,669
Forgive us. We don't usually behave like this.

273
00:21:02,963 --> 00:21:05,963
But you are our best friends.

274
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,007
You are our only friends.

275
00:21:15,015 --> 00:21:19,677
Forgive me... forgive us.

276
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:26,312
If you call for a taxi,

277
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,444
I will take my Bacchante home

278
00:21:29,737 --> 00:21:32,821
and we end our little scene.

279
00:21:33,782 --> 00:21:36,783
The finale is usually not suitable for audiences.

280
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:42,321
- What time is it? - Ten past twelve.

281
00:21:42,624 --> 00:21:47,202
- Thank God we got rid of them. - Yes, things got a little out of control.

282
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:51,453
Do you think it is possible for a couple to be partners for life?

283
00:21:51,757 --> 00:21:53,797
It is an absurd convention.

284
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:56,665
The marriage was supposed to be a five-year contract.

285
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:01,596
- Or subject to annual renewal. - What about us?

286
00:22:01,891 --> 00:22:06,718
No, we are the exception that proves the rule.

287
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:12,015
- So you think we'll stay together? - What a strange question.

288
00:22:12,318 --> 00:22:15,520
Do you sometimes feel sorry that you can't sleep with anyone else?

289
00:22:15,737 --> 00:22:17,564
- No, right? - Sometimes.

290
00:22:17,864 --> 00:22:21,233
- Well, the devil take me! - It's a purely theoretical longing.

291
00:22:21,534 --> 00:22:26,112
I wonder if there's something wrong with me, I never feel like that.

292
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:31,158
- I'm happy. - Me too. Now I have it!

293
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:38,799
Katarina and Peter are going through hell because they don't communicate with each other.

294
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:43,468
They have to translate everything they mean into a common language.

295
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:49,183
- I think it's easier than that. - We understand each other immediately.

296
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:53,474
We speak the same language, that's why we're doing well.

297
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:55,182
I think it's about money.

298
00:22:55,481 --> 00:23:00,523
If you speak the same language, money doesn't matter.

299
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,114
- You and your languages. - I see this all the time at work.

300
00:23:05,408 --> 00:23:07,483
Sometimes it is as if the couple

301
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:11,652
talk about bad phone lines.

302
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:16,581
Sometimes it is like listening to two pre-programmed tape recorders

303
00:23:16,877 --> 00:23:20,541
and sometimes it is the absolute silence of space.

304
00:23:20,838 --> 00:23:24,457
- I don't know what the worst part is. - I don't know...

305
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:29,136
Suppose the children went to daycare while we worked shifts in a factory?

306
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,968
- It wouldn't matter. - I think so.

307
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:35,965
If you speak the same language, it doesn't matter where you are.

308
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:38,143
That's a romantic view.

309
00:23:38,438 --> 00:23:43,514
Do you think our relationship would suffer if we lived that kind of life?

310
00:23:43,817 --> 00:23:48,978
- Yes, I do. Seriously. - It would damage our relationship?

311
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:51,819
“Regardless of our “language”.

312
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:56,909
Isn't the danger of alienation in our lives just as great?

313
00:23:57,205 --> 00:23:59,411
Definitely not.

314
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:04,333
Hard and arduous work places a much greater strain on people.

315
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:10,049
You are dumber than I thought, and you represent the romantic point of view.

316
00:24:10,342 --> 00:24:12,381
- We'll see. - What? What will we see?

317
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:16,757
- I don't know, do you? - Are you kidding me?

318
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:19,428
- Aren't you hungry? - Yes, terrible.

319
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:24,268
How about beer and sandwiches?

320
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:27,232
Sounds wonderful.

321
00:24:28,108 --> 00:24:31,441
The art of sweeping things under the carpet

322
00:25:10,855 --> 00:25:14,805
- Good morning. - Good morning.

323
00:25:16,236 --> 00:25:19,485
- Did you sleep well? - Like a marmot and you?

324
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:25,616
So, I woke up at 5 a.m. and couldn't go back to sleep.

325
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:28,828
- Why not? - I was very excited.

326
00:25:29,122 --> 00:25:31,992
- Should I feel guilty? - No.

327
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:36,159
For once, it's not your fault, dear.

328
00:25:36,462 --> 00:25:40,294
I lay there angry, thinking about that miserable Sunday dinner.

329
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:44,173
We always have dinner with your or my parents on Sundays.

330
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:46,925
- That's absurd. - It's because of her.

331
00:25:47,222 --> 00:25:51,136
- I'm going to cancel dinner. - Cancel?

332
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:55,479
-What will your mother say? - Whatever she damn well pleases.

333
00:25:55,772 --> 00:25:59,057
I want to spend Sunday with you and the children.

334
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:02,692
- Well, if you can manage it...! - I certainly can!

335
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:05,192
I'm fed up...

336
00:26:05,488 --> 00:26:09,438
- Is it the curse? - That's what you always say!

337
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:14,451
Even though my period is due on Monday, that might not be the reason I'm nervous.

338
00:26:14,748 --> 00:26:17,154
- What's going on? - Have you ever noticed

339
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:22,535
that our lives are predetermined and every single second is taken into account?

340
00:26:23,255 --> 00:26:29,044
- But we have our vacation. - It's even better planned.

341
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:33,176
- Don't you want to wake the girls? - They're sleeping in today.

342
00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:37,638
Karin has a day off school and Eva has a sore throat.

343
00:26:38,352 --> 00:26:43,773
She has to come with us on Sunday so we don't have to complain!

344
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:47,600
- You wanted to cancel dinner. - I'd rather you did.

345
00:26:47,903 --> 00:26:50,939
Oh no, I don't want to give your mother any excuses!

346
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:57,072
Why don't you call your mother? She's an early riser.

347
00:26:57,703 --> 00:27:01,321
- Didn't we agree that you would call? - No, dear.

348
00:27:01,624 --> 00:27:05,039
I will support you morally.

349
00:27:07,796 --> 00:27:10,167
All right, I'll do it...

350
00:27:12,342 --> 00:27:18,675
- My goodness, my heart is pounding! - The first sign of the great revolt.

351
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,518
No answer? What a relief!

352
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:39,281
Hello. Miss Alm? Is my mother here?

353
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,733
Can I speak to her briefly?

354
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:45,700
By the way, how is your knee?

355
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,488
Oh, it's not better?

356
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:54,296
Is it worse? That's too bad... What does the doctor say?

357
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:59,084
He's not likeable, you say? That's a sign of the times.

358
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:04,503
Hello, mother. How are you?

359
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:08,673
Isn't that beautiful? Is Dad already gone?

360
00:28:08,976 --> 00:28:11,135
Right, he wanted to go to the countryside.

361
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:15,268
So you just let him go off on his own?

362
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:19,480
Oh, Erik is with him. That's good.

363
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:24,440
I'm sorry, but I have to tell you something...

364
00:28:28,744 --> 00:28:32,030
Exactly, how did you guess?

365
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:35,830
What reasons do we have?

366
00:28:36,126 --> 00:28:40,420
I just want to spend Sunday with Johan and the girls.

367
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:43,880
No, we're not going anywhere.

368
00:28:44,634 --> 00:28:48,133
We just don't want to come over for dinner.

369
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:57,972
I don't think Dad was looking forward to Sunday for a second.

370
00:28:58,813 --> 00:29:03,025
It should be a pleasure and not a chore, right?

371
00:29:09,574 --> 00:29:13,618
Yes, I understand. I understand.

372
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:18,157
You didn't tell me this news.

373
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:22,536
To be honest, I'm bored to death.

374
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:25,619
No, forget it altogether, Mother.

375
00:29:25,922 --> 00:29:28,211
We will be there.

376
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:32,916
Yes, we can do this. It's okay.

377
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,889
We are looking forward to it.

378
00:29:36,181 --> 00:29:40,261
Bye for now, dear mother.

379
00:29:42,437 --> 00:29:44,892
The revolution was nipped in the bud.

380
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:48,935
Aunt Elsa is coming

381
00:29:49,235 --> 00:29:51,393
and she was so excited to see us.

382
00:29:51,695 --> 00:29:55,029
- She has a present for you. - And Mrs. Danielsson is cooking.

383
00:29:55,324 --> 00:29:58,858
- And your father really wanted to see us. - Damn!

384
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,861
I still admire your courage. We'll say no another time.

385
00:30:03,164 --> 00:30:05,537
Don't be upset.

386
00:30:08,294 --> 00:30:13,584
- Are you home for dinner? - No, we're meeting at the theater.

387
00:30:13,882 --> 00:30:16,918
Don't you enjoy coming home anymore?

388
00:30:17,218 --> 00:30:20,837
My goodness, aren't we in a good mood today?

389
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:24,389
I would like to stay in bed for a week,

390
00:30:24,684 --> 00:30:26,890
so we can just hug each other.

391
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:31,978
- And we would both cry heartily. - This is not the life we chose.

392
00:30:32,274 --> 00:30:35,809
If only I could be sure that we chose it and not our mothers.

393
00:30:36,111 --> 00:30:39,231
They suffer from maternal paranoia.

394
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:43,575
- Did you want a life like that? - No.

395
00:30:43,868 --> 00:30:47,700
What if we started cheating on each other?

396
00:30:47,997 --> 00:30:49,621
What would you do then?

397
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,202
Kill you, of course.

398
00:30:54,544 --> 00:30:58,494
- Sometimes I wish... - What?

399
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:01,716
Nothing...

400
00:31:02,301 --> 00:31:06,050
- Wait a second, I'm coming with you. - Why don't you take your own car?

401
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,588
We can go home together after the play.

402
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:14,311
- What about the girls? - I'll ask Miss Andersson to cook.

403
00:31:14,604 --> 00:31:17,808
She makes fabulous pancakes. I'll wake the girls up.

404
00:31:18,108 --> 00:31:22,270
- But I'm in a hurry. - It'll only take a minute.

405
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,595
As long as I remember, please pay your parking tickets.

406
00:32:44,895 --> 00:32:49,058
- Here's a whole stack. - Yes, sir.

407
00:32:57,949 --> 00:33:01,282
See you tonight at the theater.

408
00:33:12,212 --> 00:33:15,663
Hello? Yes, I speak.

409
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:19,464
Hello, Mom. The line is bad, I didn't recognize your voice.

410
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,544
I'm fine how are you?

411
00:33:23,847 --> 00:33:26,635
You're worried. Why is that?

412
00:33:26,934 --> 00:33:29,721
Marianne's mother called

413
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,511
and she is worried too, you say.

414
00:33:32,814 --> 00:33:34,522
Good God...

415
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:38,860
No, Marianne and I are fine.

416
00:33:39,153 --> 00:33:41,858
We are healthy and happy

417
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:45,275
and overjoyed.

418
00:33:45,576 --> 00:33:47,817
There's nothing wrong, I swear!

419
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,955
Don't worry, dear mother.

420
00:33:52,124 --> 00:33:56,168
Your intuition has led you astray.

421
00:33:56,461 --> 00:33:58,868
Marianne and I are happier than ever.

422
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:01,792
Marianne's Mother's Case

423
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:06,170
that you should do something more constructive than gossip.

424
00:34:07,804 --> 00:34:10,675
I'm under time pressure, dear mother.

425
00:34:10,974 --> 00:34:14,557
Yes, see you soon.

426
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:19,810
As I said, we'll be over on Friday. Say hello to Dad.

427
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,730
Hell and damnation!

428
00:34:31,618 --> 00:34:34,535
Am I disturbing you?

429
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:40,949
I just had to see what you were up to. There are a lot of rumors circulating.

430
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:45,083
What is this mysterious stuff?

431
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,416
- Shouldn't you be in Lund? - That's right.

432
00:34:48,716 --> 00:34:53,426
However, the students are demonstrating.

433
00:34:53,722 --> 00:34:57,007
The lectures were cancelled.

434
00:34:57,308 --> 00:35:00,178
- What will that be? - Look.

435
00:35:00,477 --> 00:35:04,427
- What should I do? - Hold this pen.

436
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:11,148
When I turn off the light, you see a bright spot on the wall.

437
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:13,853
Try touching it with the pen.

438
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:17,740
If you're wrong, draw a line there.

439
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:21,285
The TV camera will record your efforts.

440
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,153
- But it's dark. - There's infrared light.

441
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:28,455
I'll be watching on the monitor outside.

442
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:34,291
I'm turning off the light now.

443
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:38,845
Let's go.

444
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,092
Get to work.

445
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:09,154
- Are you kidding me? - No, please continue.

446
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:14,000
But... it keeps moving.

447
00:36:14,462 --> 00:36:17,878
This is not a trick, it is completely silent.

448
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:37,022
I've had enough of this. Turn on the light.

449
00:36:38,192 --> 00:36:40,314
Well, aren't you angry?

450
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:46,731
- That was uncomfortable... - Yes, it makes people nervous.

451
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:51,611
See how you have been wandering around and becoming more and more irritable.

452
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:56,989
- What does this prove? - That remains to be seen.

453
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:05,420
- I'd like a cigarette. - Sure. Take a seat.

454
00:37:05,717 --> 00:37:11,221
I quit smoking six days ago. It's terrible.

455
00:37:11,514 --> 00:37:15,346
- Withdrawal symptoms? - Stefan is gone...

456
00:37:15,643 --> 00:37:18,727
My friends avoid me,

457
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:22,722
but I will try to hold on.

458
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:24,816
Go on, take one.

459
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,395
That spy Bromeus left some here.

460
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:45,286
Oh, this is heaven!

461
00:37:45,587 --> 00:37:49,169
- Lord, what bliss! - And?

462
00:37:54,762 --> 00:37:56,837
Right...

463
00:37:58,598 --> 00:38:04,268
I spent the whole day yesterday reading your poems. Very thoughtful.

464
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,355
- They amazed me. - Were they that strange?

465
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:11,730
That's not it.

466
00:38:14,322 --> 00:38:17,322
Well, I could be wrong...

467
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:27,112
- Has Marianne read it? - No, she's not interested in poetry.

468
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:31,126
- She should be interested in you. - She is, but not like this.

469
00:38:31,962 --> 00:38:34,832
Really?

470
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:40,008
You and I are old friends.

471
00:38:40,804 --> 00:38:43,342
We never had a sexual relationship.

472
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:48,930
You can give an objective opinion before I try the editors.

473
00:38:49,228 --> 00:38:53,806
- I shouldn't bother. - Are they that bad?

474
00:38:54,108 --> 00:38:58,271
It's not that they're bad...

475
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:02,528
..if only that were the case.

476
00:39:02,824 --> 00:39:05,825
You mean they're mediocre?

477
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:12,870
Are you boring, tidy and childish?

478
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:19,121
That I indulge in spiritual masturbation?

479
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:25,176
Some of us on our team believed you were destined for greatness.

480
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:27,636
We admired you.

481
00:39:27,931 --> 00:39:31,879
You left us all behind.

482
00:39:32,518 --> 00:39:35,887
We even envied you.

483
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:40,849
- Does that influence my poetry? - No.

484
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:48,113
- You read it while craving nicotine. - That's right...

485
00:39:48,407 --> 00:39:51,443
I plan to show them everything.

486
00:39:52,328 --> 00:39:54,320
Naturally...

487
00:39:54,621 --> 00:39:58,998
I'm waiting for some publishers to tell me they're bad.

488
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:03,706
- You feel insulted. - You bet!

489
00:40:04,464 --> 00:40:06,503
I'm sorry.

490
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,790
Well, I know someone who likes her...

491
00:40:10,094 --> 00:40:13,344
- Who would that be? - Curious, aren't you?

492
00:40:18,018 --> 00:40:21,019
My dear little Johan...

493
00:40:23,898 --> 00:40:27,942
Don't pay attention to what I said.

494
00:40:28,236 --> 00:40:31,236
It was simply my desire to talk.

495
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,278
Well, I have to go.

496
00:40:36,576 --> 00:40:41,736
I'll leave the poems on your doorstep. Give Marianne my regards.

497
00:40:42,915 --> 00:40:48,419
I will stick by you through thick and thin.

498
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:49,875
Bye!

499
00:40:51,006 --> 00:40:56,629
See you around 12:30. Bye.

500
00:40:57,971 --> 00:41:01,220
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

501
00:41:02,308 --> 00:41:08,061
It is usually during this first encounter that we identify the problem.

502
00:41:08,355 --> 00:41:10,063
I want a divorce.

503
00:41:10,357 --> 00:41:14,105
- How long have you been married? - More than 20 years.

504
00:41:14,402 --> 00:41:19,064
- Do you have a job? - No, I'm a housewife.

505
00:41:19,365 --> 00:41:22,366
Why do you want a divorce?

506
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:32,707
It is a loveless marriage.

507
00:41:33,002 --> 00:41:37,130
- Is that your reason? - Yes.

508
00:41:37,423 --> 00:41:44,173
- Has it always been like this? - Yes, for the entire 20 years.

509
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:48,757
But now you want to break free.

510
00:41:50,227 --> 00:41:51,425
Yes.

511
00:41:53,271 --> 00:42:00,068
My husband is a responsible man. He is kind and conscientious.

512
00:42:00,903 --> 00:42:05,730
He was an excellent father. We never argued.

513
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:11,905
We have a beautiful apartment and a house in the countryside.

514
00:42:13,456 --> 00:42:15,864
We are both passionate about music.

515
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:20,117
We belong to a chamber music society.

516
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:24,917
- That all sounds ideal. - Yes, doesn't it?

517
00:42:25,217 --> 00:42:29,879
But there is no love between us, there never has been.

518
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:36,346
Forgive me for asking, but have you met anyone?

519
00:42:38,896 --> 00:42:40,520
No I haven't.

520
00:42:40,731 --> 00:42:42,605
What about your husband?

521
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,474
Not as far as I know.

522
00:42:45,778 --> 00:42:48,613
Won't it be lonely for you?

523
00:42:48,906 --> 00:42:52,108
I think so...

524
00:42:52,409 --> 00:42:53,951
But that's better

525
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,781
than living in a loveless marriage.

526
00:42:59,749 --> 00:43:03,829
Have you informed your husband about this?

527
00:43:04,128 --> 00:43:05,871
Naturally.

528
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:08,330
15 years ago I told him

529
00:43:08,549 --> 00:43:12,712
I didn't want to live with him.

530
00:43:13,011 --> 00:43:14,802
He asked me to wait

531
00:43:15,013 --> 00:43:17,800
until the children grew up.

532
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:21,598
Now that they have left their homes,

533
00:43:21,894 --> 00:43:24,930
I can get a divorce.

534
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,768
And what does he say?

535
00:43:29,193 --> 00:43:36,025
He constantly asks me what's wrong with our marriage.

536
00:43:36,324 --> 00:43:38,530
I tell him I can't go on

537
00:43:38,743 --> 00:43:42,277
in a relationship that lacks love.

538
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:47,822
Then he asks what this love should consist of.

539
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,333
But I can't describe it

540
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:53,748
something that doesn't exist.

541
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:58,840
Did you get along well with your children?

542
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,888
I never loved my children.

543
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,800
I know that now...

544
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:10,015
I used to think I had that. People do.

545
00:44:10,313 --> 00:44:12,021
But I know now

546
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,188
that I never loved her.

547
00:44:14,484 --> 00:44:17,899
Nevertheless, I was a good mother to her.

548
00:44:18,195 --> 00:44:21,480
I did everything I could, although

549
00:44:21,698 --> 00:44:24,734
I never felt anything for her.

550
00:44:30,915 --> 00:44:33,916
I know exactly what you’re thinking:

551
00:44:35,587 --> 00:44:39,963
“She was spoiled and has no sense of humor.”

552
00:44:41,091 --> 00:44:43,380
She has everything she could ever wish for,

553
00:44:43,677 --> 00:44:48,339
but she still complains about love.

554
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,680
There are other qualities:

555
00:44:50,892 --> 00:44:53,561
“Friendship, loyalty, security…”

556
00:44:53,853 --> 00:44:56,771
Something like that, yes.

557
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:03,318
Let me tell you something.

558
00:45:04,696 --> 00:45:07,021
I have a mental image of myself,

559
00:45:07,824 --> 00:45:12,320
which does not correspond to reality.

560
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:17,080
Forgive me for a personal question...

561
00:45:19,877 --> 00:45:23,292
Isn't it true that love...

562
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:28,961
What did you want to ask?

563
00:45:30,178 --> 00:45:33,677
I'm not sure. Forgive me.

564
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:43,601
I have the ability to love.

565
00:45:46,234 --> 00:45:53,031
But it was all... bottled.

566
00:45:56,035 --> 00:46:01,325
The life I've been living has stifled my potential.

567
00:46:02,415 --> 00:46:05,701
It's time to change that.

568
00:46:06,003 --> 00:46:08,078
The first step is divorce.

569
00:46:08,379 --> 00:46:11,913
My husband and I

570
00:46:12,217 --> 00:46:14,754
block each other in a deadly way.

571
00:46:15,053 --> 00:46:17,045
That sounds scary.

572
00:46:18,347 --> 00:46:21,348
It's scary.

573
00:46:22,183 --> 00:46:25,552
Something strange happens.

574
00:46:25,854 --> 00:46:30,432
My senses, sight, hearing, touch

575
00:46:30,733 --> 00:46:32,772
are starting to let me down.

576
00:46:33,068 --> 00:46:34,978
This table for example

577
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:38,979
I can see and touch it...

578
00:46:39,283 --> 00:46:41,524
But the sensation

579
00:46:41,826 --> 00:46:45,776
is reduced and dry.

580
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,915
Do you understand?

581
00:46:51,461 --> 00:46:53,832
I think so.

582
00:46:54,129 --> 00:46:56,964
It's the same with everything -

583
00:46:57,258 --> 00:47:03,426
Music, scents, faces and voices.

584
00:47:03,722 --> 00:47:05,797
Everything seems...

585
00:47:06,098 --> 00:47:11,603
puny, grey and undignified.

586
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:17,225
Now there is something to drink and eat.

587
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:22,443
Sitting on an empty stomach is fatal.

588
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:26,688
Do you remember when we participated in the May Day procession?

589
00:47:26,993 --> 00:47:29,828
You were the more ardent believer.

590
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,454
You told me I neglected our home.

591
00:47:33,749 --> 00:47:37,961
That was the winter we all got sick from the Asian flu.

592
00:47:38,253 --> 00:47:44,374
- Back then, we believed in the future. - It's nice to believe in something.

593
00:47:44,676 --> 00:47:49,716
And we had the pleasure of annoying our parents.

594
00:47:50,013 --> 00:47:54,390
- You were a hothead. - So was your father.

595
00:47:54,685 --> 00:47:58,433
Quite a hothead. As a socialist, you were very attractive.

596
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:03,890
Am I not very attractive now?

597
00:48:04,194 --> 00:48:07,313
But married people lose interest in each other.

598
00:48:08,739 --> 00:48:12,155
We don't have that.

599
00:48:12,868 --> 00:48:17,329
We simply have too much to do and are completely exhausted in the evenings.

600
00:48:17,623 --> 00:48:21,751
That wasn't an accusation, I promise.

601
00:48:22,043 --> 00:48:27,879
- We like each other. - Not like that.

602
00:48:28,174 --> 00:48:32,717
- Oh yes, we do. - Our lives are full of excuses.

603
00:48:33,012 --> 00:48:37,839
It's not my fault that I don't enjoy it as much as I used to.

604
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:43,645
There's a natural explanation. You shouldn't blame me.

605
00:48:43,938 --> 00:48:48,481
- Don't get upset. - We have a great sex life.

606
00:48:48,775 --> 00:48:55,229
We're not as passionate these days, but it could be worse.

607
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:59,232
Sex isn't everything.

608
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:04,245
If you are not satisfied, find a lover

609
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,411
who is more sexually exciting.

610
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:11,078
- I assure you, I'll do my best! - Right...

611
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,958
You have that look again.

612
00:49:18,261 --> 00:49:22,259
Tell me what you're thinking about.

613
00:49:22,557 --> 00:49:27,681
- You're just getting angry. - No, I'm listening.

614
00:49:27,978 --> 00:49:32,272
Why make sex so complicated?

615
00:49:32,565 --> 00:49:35,103
It's pretty basic stuff.

616
00:49:35,401 --> 00:49:39,648
It has become a sore point.

617
00:49:39,947 --> 00:49:42,948
It's all your mother's fault.

618
00:49:43,243 --> 00:49:47,785
- You're so superficial. - You're a grump!

619
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,750
You blame me for everything.

620
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:55,085
- You said you'd do your best. - I am!

621
00:49:55,379 --> 00:49:57,537
This is absurd!

622
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:01,338
Are you calling me a liar?

623
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:04,256
Then what are you talking about?

624
00:50:04,554 --> 00:50:08,171
Let's leave that and go to bed.

625
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:12,553
It's typical of you to upset me so

626
00:50:12,853 --> 00:50:16,685
and then yawn and say it's bedtime.

627
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:22,058
They suffer from unbridled ambition.

628
00:50:22,362 --> 00:50:25,695
We often joke about

629
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:30,984
but can't our miserable sex life be spared?

630
00:50:31,286 --> 00:50:34,286
Why don't you leave me alone?

631
00:50:34,581 --> 00:50:37,250
First you attack me because I don't try

632
00:50:37,459 --> 00:50:39,996
and later for the effort.

633
00:50:40,294 --> 00:50:41,409
And now look what I did!

634
00:50:41,712 --> 00:50:43,586
Yes, you actually did.

635
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:54,714
Couldn't you be kind instead?

636
00:50:55,016 --> 00:51:00,093
Well, well... Don't be sad. I'm sorry.

637
00:51:00,396 --> 00:51:05,473
You know, you can talk too much about these things.

638
00:51:05,776 --> 00:51:09,774
I know you shouldn’t keep secrets,

639
00:51:10,072 --> 00:51:13,939
but in this case the rule is wrong.

640
00:51:14,242 --> 00:51:19,402
There are some things you shouldn't snoop into.

641
00:51:19,706 --> 00:51:26,040
We hurt each other endlessly

642
00:51:26,337 --> 00:51:30,417
and the barbs are still there when we go to bed.

643
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:33,835
It's like lying on a bed of nails.

644
00:51:35,136 --> 00:51:37,806
- What are you laughing about? - The nail bed.

645
00:51:38,514 --> 00:51:42,429
- Laughter is all well and good. - Let's go to bed.

646
00:51:42,727 --> 00:51:46,095
They were incredibly tactless.

647
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:48,769
I apologize.

648
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:53,609
Don't I give you enough affection?

649
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:56,062
Affection takes time.

650
00:51:56,364 --> 00:52:02,568
- Then you're not getting enough. - We're not getting enough, and we're not giving enough either.

651
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,998
That's why I wanted us to go away this summer.

652
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:11,786
Affection should not be saved for vacation.

653
00:52:12,086 --> 00:52:14,494
You're nice even if you're an idiot.

654
00:52:14,797 --> 00:52:17,419
Luckily, I'm married to you.

655
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:23,091
You're mediocre, but you have your moments of greatness.

656
00:52:24,807 --> 00:52:29,350
At our age, thousands of brain cells burn out every day.

657
00:52:29,644 --> 00:52:36,263
- Never to be replaced... - You must lose a million!

658
00:52:38,027 --> 00:52:43,981
You're incredibly sweet anyway, even when you swear and make a fuss.

659
00:52:45,993 --> 00:52:49,112
I've almost fallen asleep.

660
00:52:49,412 --> 00:52:55,865
- I'm just checking on the kids. - I'm almost asleep, so don't worry.

661
00:53:07,012 --> 00:53:10,961
Don't you want to set the alarm?

662
00:53:17,062 --> 00:53:21,012
If you want, you can sleep with me now.

663
00:53:21,316 --> 00:53:24,685
Thanks for the offer, but I'm too tired.

664
00:54:10,027 --> 00:54:15,733
Already here? I wasn't expecting you until tomorrow.

665
00:54:16,033 --> 00:54:21,537
What a nice surprise! Are you hungry?

666
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:24,866
We all went to bed early.

667
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:31,667
We thought we'd go to bed early. The girls and I were on a diet.

668
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:36,922
- Would you like some sandwiches? - Sounds good to me.

669
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:42,640
Or should I fry you some eggs and ham or make you some soup?

670
00:54:42,933 --> 00:54:45,637
No, sandwiches and beer are perfectly sufficient.

671
00:54:45,935 --> 00:54:49,850
By the way, Peter and Katarina will call you on Monday.

672
00:54:50,148 --> 00:54:54,192
What an ordeal they are going through!

673
00:54:54,485 --> 00:54:58,019
They don't seem to be able to agree on their divorce.

674
00:54:58,322 --> 00:55:04,407
I told them they should each get a lawyer, but they don't want to.

675
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:08,486
Listen, put on your pajamas and I'll bring in a tray.

676
00:55:08,789 --> 00:55:11,245
Sounds good...

677
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:15,077
I was afraid you would be angry with me.

678
00:55:15,379 --> 00:55:20,455
- Why should I? - I was horrible on the phone.

679
00:55:21,843 --> 00:55:25,509
I called back, but you had pulled the plug.

680
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:28,010
I was tired last night.

681
00:55:28,307 --> 00:55:32,056
I was with that idiot from the ministry.

682
00:55:32,353 --> 00:55:37,477
These bureaucratic idiots who are responsible for our well-being...

683
00:55:37,775 --> 00:55:42,436
- I still think I behaved badly. - Let's drop the subject.

684
00:55:42,737 --> 00:55:46,605
You never want to stop talking,

685
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:49,445
but that won't last long, dear.

686
00:55:49,744 --> 00:55:55,912
I just wanted to say that you were right, but so was I.

687
00:55:56,208 --> 00:56:01,997
If you don't want to wear a tuxedo, that's your business.

688
00:56:02,297 --> 00:56:09,213
- But I have a right to my own opinion. - I hate wearing a tuxedo.

689
00:56:09,512 --> 00:56:15,051
It's a ridiculous outfit. I feel like a chimpanzee in disguise.

690
00:56:15,351 --> 00:56:17,426
Let's not start arguing.

691
00:56:17,728 --> 00:56:20,479
Tuxedo or not, I love you.

692
00:56:20,772 --> 00:56:24,105
A tuxedo is hardly necessary for our marriage.

693
00:56:24,401 --> 00:56:28,861
- That's how it seemed to me last night. - I said I was wrong.

694
00:56:35,619 --> 00:56:39,664
When I watch you eat, I get hungry...

695
00:56:41,916 --> 00:56:45,332
I need a sandwich.

696
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:50,254
I'm so hungry, I feel dizzy.

697
00:56:50,549 --> 00:56:57,512
I've lost almost two kilos this week. Is it noticeable?

698
00:56:57,806 --> 00:57:00,261
However, I can feel it.

699
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,974
But sometimes it seems pointless...

700
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:08,482
Why should we deny ourselves the good things in life?

701
00:57:08,774 --> 00:57:13,103
Why can't we be fat and happy?

702
00:57:13,404 --> 00:57:16,404
Do you remember Aunt Miriam and Uncle David?

703
00:57:16,698 --> 00:57:19,450
They were tall, fat and cheerful.

704
00:57:19,742 --> 00:57:25,863
They slept holding hands in their double bed.

705
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:31,586
Happy with each other, just as they were.

706
00:57:31,878 --> 00:57:35,497
Why can’t we be like them,

707
00:57:35,799 --> 00:57:38,883
full of satisfaction?

708
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,212
What's up?

709
00:57:42,513 --> 00:57:45,218
Are you angry?

710
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,513
Something happened?

711
00:57:49,812 --> 00:57:51,769
What's up?

712
00:57:53,274 --> 00:57:55,231
Tell me.

713
00:57:59,946 --> 00:58:03,362
I came here to tell you something.

714
00:58:07,912 --> 00:58:11,744
I went there and fell in love.

715
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:17,627
It's pretty absurd and probably completely wrong...

716
00:58:21,299 --> 00:58:25,427
I met her at this conference in June.

717
00:58:26,763 --> 00:58:29,217
She was an interpreter.

718
00:58:29,515 --> 00:58:34,639
She studies Slavic studies.

719
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,639
She's not particularly nice to look at.

720
00:58:40,942 --> 00:58:44,774
You might even find them ugly.

721
00:58:46,447 --> 00:58:50,065
I have no idea what this will lead to.

722
00:58:50,367 --> 00:58:54,199
I don't know anything. I'm confused.

723
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:01,200
On a certain level I am happy

724
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,622
but I feel so guilty towards you and the girls.

725
00:59:04,922 --> 00:59:08,504
We always got along so well.

726
00:59:10,803 --> 00:59:15,014
Things were neither better nor worse

727
00:59:15,307 --> 00:59:18,307
than in most families.

728
00:59:22,814 --> 00:59:26,147
Say something, for heaven's sake.

729
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:31,608
I don't know what to say.

730
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,903
It was wrong not to tell you sooner,

731
00:59:39,204 --> 00:59:44,363
but I thought I would get over it.

732
00:59:44,666 --> 00:59:47,453
I didn't mean to alarm you.

733
00:59:48,462 --> 00:59:50,335
It's funny...

734
00:59:54,217 --> 00:59:57,218
...that I didn't notice anything.

735
00:59:57,512 --> 01:00:03,052
Everything was as usual.

736
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:07,348
In fact, even better.

737
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:09,888
You were so sweet.

738
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:15,066
I was a stupid, blind fool.

739
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:18,362
I didn't understand...

740
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,984
- How humiliating. - No, you didn't understand anything.

741
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:27,116
You have never been particularly attentive.

742
01:00:30,959 --> 01:00:35,585
- What happens next? - I don't know.

743
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,672
Do you want a divorce?

744
01:00:37,966 --> 01:00:40,373
Will you marry her?

745
01:00:40,677 --> 01:00:47,046
Why are you telling me now? What's the rush?

746
01:00:54,731 --> 01:00:58,265
We're going to Paris tomorrow.

747
01:01:00,695 --> 01:01:05,356
I want to escape it all.

748
01:01:06,116 --> 01:01:10,576
I wanted to go there this fall anyway.

749
01:01:11,413 --> 01:01:15,411
Paula has this scholarship...

750
01:01:17,377 --> 01:01:19,868
..and I want to be with her.

751
01:01:20,171 --> 01:01:24,215
I can't do it without her.

752
01:01:24,508 --> 01:01:28,043
So we're leaving tomorrow.

753
01:01:33,558 --> 01:01:36,227
Now that I'm talking to you,

754
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:39,639
I want to get rid of the whole damn thing.

755
01:01:39,939 --> 01:01:43,354
I am tired and scared.

756
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:47,694
Nothing could be more ridiculous.

757
01:01:47,988 --> 01:01:52,032
I know exactly what you're thinking.

758
01:01:54,118 --> 01:01:57,451
How can you know that?

759
01:01:57,747 --> 01:02:04,413
I try not to feel guilty, which is quite a burden for me.

760
01:02:04,711 --> 01:02:08,377
Facts are facts, there's nothing you can do about them.

761
01:02:09,132 --> 01:02:14,588
Let's go to bed. I suppose you have to get up early.

762
01:02:14,887 --> 01:02:18,802
I have a meeting at nine.

763
01:02:20,268 --> 01:02:23,683
Then we should get some sleep.

764
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:43,503
Won't you take your clothes off?

765
01:04:04,946 --> 01:04:07,982
You have spots on your chest.

766
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:11,273
How tactless of you.

767
01:04:12,953 --> 01:04:16,951
Is my gray suit here or in town?

768
01:04:17,249 --> 01:04:21,117
- It's at the dry cleaners. - What a shame.

769
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:24,420
Did you want to bring it?

770
01:04:26,007 --> 01:04:29,541
Can't you pick it up?

771
01:04:29,845 --> 01:04:31,636
I won't have time.

772
01:04:31,929 --> 01:04:35,974
I'm busy until 3 p.m.

773
01:04:37,309 --> 01:04:40,974
I can pick it up for you.

774
01:04:41,271 --> 01:04:45,932
I'll also do the packing for you. You're not good at that sort of thing.

775
01:04:46,234 --> 01:04:49,234
- No, thank you. - Don't be silly...

776
01:04:49,529 --> 01:04:52,898
I'm a bit conventional.

777
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:57,572
I think you have everything you need here.

778
01:04:58,829 --> 01:05:03,823
There are clean shirts and underwear.

779
01:05:06,211 --> 01:05:11,121
Why not travel in a jacket and flannel?

780
01:05:11,424 --> 01:05:14,626
- They give you a youthful look. - Whatever you say...

781
01:05:25,729 --> 01:05:29,808
- How long will you be gone? - That depends.

782
01:05:30,107 --> 01:05:32,776
What do you mean?

783
01:05:33,068 --> 01:05:40,031
I took at least six months of vacation.

784
01:05:40,743 --> 01:05:45,202
I'll probably be away for at least seven or eight months.

785
01:05:45,497 --> 01:05:48,497
I want to make a clean break.

786
01:05:52,962 --> 01:05:57,208
- And if I'm not here? - I don't care at all.

787
01:06:00,259 --> 01:06:06,214
Do you know how long I've wanted to leave?

788
01:06:07,308 --> 01:06:11,057
How long have I been thinking about leaving you?

789
01:06:11,354 --> 01:06:14,769
- Don't tell me! - Four years!

790
01:06:15,065 --> 01:06:19,394
- I can't stand this! - Empty words...

791
01:06:35,084 --> 01:06:39,246
What will you live on?

792
01:06:40,588 --> 01:06:44,800
You have to pay child support.

793
01:06:45,092 --> 01:06:48,093
Don't worry, I'll manage.

794
01:06:49,597 --> 01:06:52,052
You must have assets that I know nothing about.

795
01:06:52,266 --> 01:06:54,554
That's right, Marianne.

796
01:06:56,353 --> 01:07:00,849
- How is that possible? - Listen, damn it!

797
01:07:02,108 --> 01:07:05,524
Even if it's none of your damn business,

798
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:08,655
I sold the boat

799
01:07:08,948 --> 01:07:12,114
and I took out a loan.

800
01:07:12,743 --> 01:07:17,618
The bank pays you and the girls 1,600 kroner per month.

801
01:07:18,164 --> 01:07:22,493
We'll arrange something else when I get back.

802
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:27,538
Get advice from your colleagues, I don't care.

803
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:30,212
Name your price!

804
01:07:30,509 --> 01:07:36,629
I'm taking nothing with me except my books.

805
01:07:36,932 --> 01:07:38,343
I'll just disappear.

806
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:41,512
I will dematerialize myself.

807
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:47,566
I will pay whatever I can to support you.

808
01:07:47,858 --> 01:07:51,902
I'm only interested in putting an end to this.

809
01:07:56,950 --> 01:08:00,069
Do you know what annoys me the most?

810
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:03,785
All this fuss about what is expected of us

811
01:08:04,082 --> 01:08:06,370
and the people we have to accommodate.

812
01:08:06,667 --> 01:08:09,703
What will your mother think?

813
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:16,373
Shouldn't we invite so-and-so to dinner?

814
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:21,053
We have to go here, we have to go there...

815
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:26,222
We have to celebrate Christmas, Easter, birthdays...

816
01:08:26,518 --> 01:08:30,053
Every single damn opportunity!

817
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,983
- My poor darling... - I don't want your pity!

818
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,688
Stop groping me!

819
01:08:46,204 --> 01:08:52,205
It's pure affectation that I keep walking like this.

820
01:08:52,501 --> 01:08:56,083
I can't get to the truth about us.

821
01:08:56,379 --> 01:08:59,380
There is no one truth.

822
01:09:02,259 --> 01:09:06,720
Wherever we turn, it hurts.

823
01:09:13,186 --> 01:09:16,935
Please don't go!

824
01:09:17,231 --> 01:09:21,099
- I beg you. - It's no use.

825
01:09:21,402 --> 01:09:27,736
Postpone your trip. I think we can save our marriage.

826
01:09:28,033 --> 01:09:33,489
We could make a fresh start. You have to give me a chance!

827
01:09:33,788 --> 01:09:36,789
Maybe Paula would understand me.

828
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:41,412
I should meet her and talk to her...

829
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:47,756
Let's tackle this together. Give me a chance!

830
01:09:48,052 --> 01:09:51,883
You are presenting me with a fait accompli.

831
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:56,178
They are forcing me into an unbearable situation.

832
01:09:56,476 --> 01:10:01,303
They think: What will our parents say!

833
01:10:01,606 --> 01:10:04,274
What will our friends think? Jesus, how tongues will wag!

834
01:10:04,566 --> 01:10:07,935
What impact will it have on the girls?

835
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:12,020
What about the dinner parties?

836
01:10:12,324 --> 01:10:16,321
What will you tell Peter and Katarina? Who cares?

837
01:10:16,619 --> 01:10:19,074
It feels good to be a villain!

838
01:10:19,371 --> 01:10:21,495
That's not what I meant.

839
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:23,747
Forget it...

840
01:10:37,931 --> 01:10:40,468
I forgot to set the alarm.

841
01:10:41,392 --> 01:10:47,264
- What time do you have to leave? - Please set it for 5:30 a.m.

842
01:10:47,564 --> 01:10:52,640
I have to pack and have a conference at nine.

843
01:10:52,944 --> 01:10:56,562
I've been wanting to get a new alarm clock for a long time.

844
01:10:56,864 --> 01:11:02,107
This one is so loud and not very reliable.

845
01:11:02,411 --> 01:11:05,744
There it is set to 5:30 am.

846
01:11:06,039 --> 01:11:11,116
I'll wake up on my own anyway, so you don't have to worry.

847
01:11:20,261 --> 01:11:26,299
- Tell me about Paula. - Please... What's going on?

848
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,894
- Why are you torturing yourself? - I want to know what she's like.

849
01:11:31,187 --> 01:11:36,145
It is much worse to imagine a faceless threat.

850
01:11:38,736 --> 01:11:42,983
- Do you have a picture of her? - Can't we be spared this torture?

851
01:11:43,282 --> 01:11:46,567
Please help me with this.

852
01:11:46,868 --> 01:11:49,869
Well, you asked for it...

853
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:55,577
Where's my wallet? I guess it's in my jacket...

854
01:12:07,512 --> 01:12:10,217
Here are two photos.

855
01:12:11,975 --> 01:12:15,473
This was taken two years ago on vacation.

856
01:12:15,769 --> 01:12:20,846
This is her passport photo. It looks good.

857
01:12:27,072 --> 01:12:30,108
She has a beautiful figure.

858
01:12:30,408 --> 01:12:36,362
- And nice breasts, right? - Yes, she does...

859
01:12:38,666 --> 01:12:43,742
- Does she dye her hair? - That's possible.

860
01:12:44,462 --> 01:12:49,457
- She has a beautiful smile. How old is she? - 23.

861
01:12:56,557 --> 01:13:00,471
She had no luck in love.

862
01:13:01,812 --> 01:13:05,346
She was engaged twice

863
01:13:05,649 --> 01:13:10,524
and had many affairs.

864
01:13:11,696 --> 01:13:15,147
- Does that bother you? - Yes, it does...

865
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:22,491
Her openness is quite uncomfortable.

866
01:13:22,789 --> 01:13:28,909
She insists on telling me details about her erotic past.

867
01:13:29,212 --> 01:13:34,550
I suffer from retrospective jealousy.

868
01:13:35,551 --> 01:13:39,335
She has no illusions

869
01:13:39,638 --> 01:13:43,387
and she doesn't have high hopes for either of us.

870
01:13:43,684 --> 01:13:47,847
She knows I'll come back to you.

871
01:13:48,146 --> 01:13:54,894
This all sounds like a tired old melodrama.

872
01:13:59,406 --> 01:14:02,774
Are you compatible in bed?

873
01:14:17,381 --> 01:14:19,954
Yes, we actually are.

874
01:14:23,928 --> 01:14:27,842
At first everything was wrong.

875
01:14:29,808 --> 01:14:32,892
I wasn't used to it—to being with other women, I mean.

876
01:14:33,187 --> 01:14:39,190
We spoiled each other, you and I, and we lived in our own bubble.

877
01:14:39,485 --> 01:14:43,897
Everything went like clockwork.

878
01:14:44,197 --> 01:14:49,784
- The lack of oxygen suffocated us. - And Paula will revive you?

879
01:14:51,579 --> 01:14:54,496
I have little self-confidence.

880
01:14:54,790 --> 01:15:00,163
I know little about reality, despite all the books I have read,

881
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:04,210
but this could be an opportunity for you and me to truly live.

882
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:08,217
Did Paula put such nonsense into your head?

883
01:15:08,511 --> 01:15:14,880
- How naive can one be? - We can do without your taunts.

884
01:15:16,476 --> 01:15:20,889
- Forgive me. - I'm trying...

885
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:26,645
I'm trying to be honest, and it's not easy!

886
01:15:36,202 --> 01:15:40,366
We've never talked like this before.

887
01:15:40,665 --> 01:15:44,663
Is it any wonder we are naive?

888
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:50,001
What else can we expect?

889
01:16:03,311 --> 01:16:06,098
You're in a bind.

890
01:16:16,323 --> 01:16:19,323
Come and lie down next to me.

891
01:16:20,202 --> 01:16:21,779
Come...

892
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:38,965
I want you to sleep with me.

893
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:41,217
Please?

894
01:16:42,555 --> 01:16:45,555
For old times' sake.

895
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:36,310
Lie here in my arms

896
01:17:37,689 --> 01:17:42,397
and we both go to sleep together.

897
01:17:46,364 --> 01:17:48,356
I don't think I can sleep.

898
01:17:48,657 --> 01:17:53,449
I'd better go right away.

899
01:17:54,204 --> 01:17:57,454
Close your eyes.

900
01:17:57,749 --> 01:18:02,457
We both need the rest.

901
01:18:02,754 --> 01:18:06,288
Tomorrow will be a busy day.

902
01:18:10,176 --> 01:18:14,174
I'm so damn ashamed.

903
01:18:14,472 --> 01:18:17,972
We'll talk about that later.

904
01:18:18,726 --> 01:18:21,478
At the moment there are only two of us.

905
01:18:21,771 --> 01:18:24,344
We still have a few hours left.

906
01:18:25,148 --> 01:18:27,023
Just you and me...

907
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:11,792
- Do you want to pack or eat first? - You decide.

908
01:21:15,012 --> 01:21:19,389
- Tea or coffee? - Tea, please.

909
01:21:50,795 --> 01:21:55,789
- What about your mail? - I'll send you my address.

910
01:21:56,091 --> 01:22:02,841
You can forward the letters and pay the bills as usual.

911
01:22:09,228 --> 01:22:13,440
The plumber should come to fix the bathroom.

912
01:22:13,733 --> 01:22:15,974
Should I call him?

913
01:22:16,277 --> 01:22:22,445
I thought you might have forgotten.

914
01:22:22,741 --> 01:22:28,577
I called him dozens of times and I haven't forgotten.

915
01:22:30,039 --> 01:22:34,286
What about your car?

916
01:22:34,585 --> 01:22:37,870
I asked Paula's sister to take care of it.

917
01:22:38,171 --> 01:22:41,956
She needs a car.

918
01:22:42,259 --> 01:22:44,050
I understand.

919
01:22:45,095 --> 01:22:46,968
would you mind

920
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:50,180
cancel my dentist appointment?

921
01:22:53,644 --> 01:22:59,765
Your father's birthday is on Friday, we want to eat there.

922
01:23:00,067 --> 01:23:03,601
Do you plan to call him?

923
01:23:03,903 --> 01:23:07,486
This is difficult...

924
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:10,023
Maybe I can write him a letter.

925
01:23:10,326 --> 01:23:12,651
As long as you don't forget.

926
01:23:13,829 --> 01:23:17,494
Dealing with our parents becomes difficult.

927
01:23:24,381 --> 01:23:28,710
- What should I tell the girls? - Say what you want.

928
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:35,012
- That you left us? - You couldn't have put it better.

929
01:23:35,307 --> 01:23:38,510
I don't expect you to understand me.

930
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:42,724
I have to go now to avoid the traffic.

931
01:23:43,022 --> 01:23:46,972
Goodbye, Marianne. Take care.

932
01:23:49,445 --> 01:23:54,486
- Maybe I'll be home in a week. - I wish...

933
01:23:57,494 --> 01:24:00,945
We would make a fresh start.

934
01:24:01,247 --> 01:24:04,913
We would throw old, established routines overboard.

935
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:08,909
We would talk about the past.

936
01:24:09,214 --> 01:24:11,668
We would try to figure out where we went wrong.

937
01:24:11,965 --> 01:24:16,627
You would never hear me blame you.

938
01:24:19,472 --> 01:24:21,382
Johan, it's all so unreal...

939
01:24:21,683 --> 01:24:25,846
I don't know what to do.

940
01:24:26,437 --> 01:24:28,975
You're excluding me.

941
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:32,772
Any solution would be better than this.

942
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:38,359
Couldn't you promise me you'd come back? Then at least I'd have something.

943
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:42,072
You can't leave me without hope.

944
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:45,986
Even if you don't plan on coming back, tell me you will.

945
01:24:46,288 --> 01:24:49,289
I have to go now.

946
01:26:32,302 --> 01:26:36,465
Fredrik? It's Marianne. Sorry to wake you.

947
01:26:36,764 --> 01:26:42,138
Is Birgit here? No, let her sleep.

948
01:26:42,937 --> 01:26:45,179
So, how are you?

949
01:26:45,814 --> 01:26:52,351
Oh, you're an early riser, aren't you? I won't keep you long.

950
01:26:52,654 --> 01:26:57,730
It's cloudy... That sounds nice.

951
01:26:58,034 --> 01:27:01,284
I need to talk to you about something.

952
01:27:06,958 --> 01:27:09,876
I really need to talk...

953
01:27:10,171 --> 01:27:13,171
You and Birgit are friends of ours.

954
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:17,507
I have to...

955
01:27:22,307 --> 01:27:24,713
It's all so unreal, Fredrik.

956
01:27:26,727 --> 01:27:28,305
You see...

957
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:35,735
I'm close to tears

958
01:27:36,027 --> 01:27:40,024
and crying only makes everything worse.

959
01:27:41,401 --> 01:27:47,735
Johan has fallen in love with another woman.

960
01:27:48,033 --> 01:27:51,069
They are leaving for Paris today.

961
01:27:51,369 --> 01:27:54,405
Couldn't you talk to him?

962
01:27:54,705 --> 01:27:58,323
Tell him not to do anything rash.

963
01:28:04,465 --> 01:28:09,541
Have you spoken to him yet?

964
01:28:16,392 --> 01:28:18,349
I understand...

965
01:28:27,069 --> 01:28:30,235
So you both always knew?

966
01:28:33,991 --> 01:28:37,989
You knew, but never told me?

967
01:28:40,706 --> 01:28:43,327
And you call yourselves friends?

968
01:28:43,626 --> 01:28:46,792
How could you be so disloyal?

969
01:28:47,087 --> 01:28:50,502
I don't believe your explanations!

970
01:28:50,798 --> 01:28:53,882
All the times we met

971
01:28:54,177 --> 01:28:58,008
and none of you said a word...

972
01:28:59,848 --> 01:29:02,174
Damned!

973
01:29:02,476 --> 01:29:04,432
What kind of friends are you?

974
01:29:04,728 --> 01:29:08,677
To hell with your explanations!

975
01:29:09,358 --> 01:29:13,520
How many others did you know?

976
01:29:14,862 --> 01:29:17,151
Oh, lots of people...

977
01:29:17,448 --> 01:29:19,654
Well, isn't that nice!

978
01:29:39,635 --> 01:29:43,714
THE VALLEY OF TEARS

979
01:29:59,653 --> 01:30:02,654
Please come in.

980
01:30:02,948 --> 01:30:06,945
My goodness, you're pretty! What a beautiful blouse.

981
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:11,632
I liked it when I bought it, but it's kind of girly.

982
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:14,052
It suits you.

983
01:30:14,077 --> 01:30:18,740
I feel nervous standing here like this.

984
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:24,473
Me too, I was useless all day.

985
01:30:24,899 --> 01:30:29,193
I know it's silly, but I haven't seen you in over six months.

986
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:32,965
- How come you suddenly...? - Paula is in London.

987
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:39,177
- Would you like something to drink? - Yes, please.

988
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:41,309
Ein Whisky, pur.

989
01:30:41,814 --> 01:30:44,388
It soothes the stomach.

990
01:30:45,236 --> 01:30:48,237
Have you ever drunk whiskey?

991
01:30:55,913 --> 01:31:02,033
Aunt Berit takes care of the girls, much to everyone’s delight.

992
01:31:02,336 --> 01:31:06,167
Tomorrow they are going to the countryside.

993
01:31:06,464 --> 01:31:10,414
Well... meeting them might have been unpleasant.

994
01:31:10,718 --> 01:31:14,550
- How are you? - Don't just ask out of politeness.

995
01:31:14,847 --> 01:31:20,137
Please don't forget your birthdays again.

996
01:31:20,436 --> 01:31:25,346
I bought them gifts from you, but that didn't deceive them.

997
01:31:25,898 --> 01:31:31,141
Can't you take her to the movies one day?

998
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:33,936
It's hard for them not to hear from you.

999
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:38,486
Nowadays they hardly mention you anymore.

1000
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:43,991
- The way Paula holds you... - If you start ranting, I'll leave.

1001
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:48,833
You yourself said that she is jealous.

1002
01:31:49,129 --> 01:31:53,589
Are you such a coward that you can't stand up to her?

1003
01:31:56,593 --> 01:31:59,297
I'm sorry.

1004
01:31:59,595 --> 01:32:04,590
I know you think it's absurd,

1005
01:32:04,892 --> 01:32:08,640
But don't scold me, it won't help.

1006
01:32:10,105 --> 01:32:14,434
- Would you like some more whiskey? - Yes, please.

1007
01:32:19,823 --> 01:32:26,536
- How are you, Johan? - Pretty much the same as always.

1008
01:32:27,288 --> 01:32:32,115
- And you? - I can't complain.

1009
01:32:35,237 --> 01:32:37,989
It was stupid of me to suggest that.

1010
01:32:38,601 --> 01:32:42,765
We can't talk without hurting each other.

1011
01:32:44,190 --> 01:32:49,065
I have an excellent suggestion: Let's have dinner.

1012
01:32:49,227 --> 01:32:54,304
- Then we won't run into each other. - An excellent suggestion.

1013
01:33:13,706 --> 01:33:16,374
You look terrible with this haircut

1014
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,287
and you have gained weight.

1015
01:33:21,588 --> 01:33:25,003
You really turn me on.

1016
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:30,091
- What should we do about it? - We'll see after dinner.

1017
01:33:32,431 --> 01:33:39,394
- What a delicious wine! - It's just a cheap red wine.

1018
01:33:39,688 --> 01:33:43,636
Things are going well for me at the moment.

1019
01:33:43,942 --> 01:33:47,559
I was offered a professorship at Cleveland University.

1020
01:33:49,321 --> 01:33:52,904
It's a good move both financially and career-wise.

1021
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:56,568
Something is happening

1022
01:33:56,870 --> 01:34:02,824
and I would like to emigrate, nothing is keeping me here.

1023
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:06,079
I'm fed up with this dump

1024
01:34:06,379 --> 01:34:09,295
and I hate being ripped off with taxes.

1025
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:13,800
So I'll be leaving in the spring if all goes well.

1026
01:34:14,094 --> 01:34:16,217
Congratulations.

1027
01:34:16,512 --> 01:34:21,138
I talk a lot about myself, but I'm in such a good mood.

1028
01:34:22,101 --> 01:34:25,386
Maybe we can talk about our divorce.

1029
01:34:25,687 --> 01:34:30,895
If you are going to emigrate, we should do it now.

1030
01:34:31,193 --> 01:34:34,442
- As you wish. - I want a divorce.

1031
01:34:34,737 --> 01:34:40,242
I might want to remarry, and if you're in the US, that would be complicated.

1032
01:34:40,534 --> 01:34:43,654
Do you have someone in mind?

1033
01:34:43,954 --> 01:34:46,492
Perhaps.

1034
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:51,536
Come on, tell me more.

1035
01:34:54,047 --> 01:35:00,167
- Would you like anything else? - No, thank you. Don't be evasive.

1036
01:35:00,469 --> 01:35:02,592
How are you?

1037
01:35:02,888 --> 01:35:06,588
Judging by your appearance,

1038
01:35:06,892 --> 01:35:09,679
they must be pretty good.

1039
01:35:09,978 --> 01:35:13,347
Do you have a lover?

1040
01:35:13,648 --> 01:35:17,942
I'll just quickly get the coffee.

1041
01:35:48,263 --> 01:35:49,591
Also...

1042
01:35:59,356 --> 01:36:03,650
It sounds like you are disappointed.

1043
01:36:07,281 --> 01:36:09,771
It's just your imagination.

1044
01:36:16,122 --> 01:36:20,071
I think about you all the time.

1045
01:36:20,375 --> 01:36:25,999
I wonder if you are okay or if you are lonely and scared.

1046
01:36:27,341 --> 01:36:31,005
Every day, several times a day,

1047
01:36:31,303 --> 01:36:36,297
I wonder what I did to cause the rift between us.

1048
01:36:37,057 --> 01:36:42,727
I know it's childish of me.

1049
01:36:45,857 --> 01:36:49,523
What did i do wrong?

1050
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:51,812
Why don't you ask a psychiatrist?

1051
01:36:52,947 --> 01:36:57,573
I go to one several times a week.

1052
01:36:57,868 --> 01:37:02,863
- Sometimes we even meet privately. - Is he your lover?

1053
01:37:03,165 --> 01:37:09,203
We had sex a few times, but it wasn't good.

1054
01:37:09,504 --> 01:37:12,458
So let's dedicate ourselves to my soul.

1055
01:37:14,092 --> 01:37:16,048
Where did that get you?

1056
01:37:17,303 --> 01:37:19,545
Nowhere.

1057
01:37:19,847 --> 01:37:23,180
Basically, I'm learning to speak.

1058
01:37:23,475 --> 01:37:28,183
I threw your things out of the study and brought mine in.

1059
01:37:28,939 --> 01:37:34,395
I felt guilty, but also brave.

1060
01:37:34,694 --> 01:37:37,695
At least it led to something.

1061
01:37:39,657 --> 01:37:44,614
- What a massive yawn. - Sorry, it's the wine.

1062
01:37:44,911 --> 01:37:49,454
Also, I didn't sleep well and was tense.

1063
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:54,292
- If you want to go home... - Don't get so upset.

1064
01:37:54,587 --> 01:38:00,423
- You can take a nap if you want. - What a fuss about a yawn.

1065
01:38:00,718 --> 01:38:06,092
I would rather listen to stories about your spiritual journey.

1066
01:38:06,723 --> 01:38:09,640
There isn't much to tell.

1067
01:38:09,934 --> 01:38:14,809
But last night I noticed something strange.

1068
01:38:15,105 --> 01:38:17,394
That sounds exciting.

1069
01:38:17,691 --> 01:38:22,934
My therapist asked me to write down everything that came to mind.

1070
01:38:23,238 --> 01:38:27,105
No matter how irrelevant. Everything...

1071
01:38:27,409 --> 01:38:31,109
I haven't written much so far; I'm not used to writing.

1072
01:38:31,412 --> 01:38:35,955
It often seems stilted and a little silly.

1073
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:41,410
Why don't you read me what you wrote last night?

1074
01:38:41,713 --> 01:38:45,545
Do you really want to hear it?

1075
01:38:45,842 --> 01:38:49,673
I'll just quickly go and get my notebook.

1076
01:38:49,971 --> 01:38:54,965
I was up until three in the morning writing,

1077
01:38:55,267 --> 01:38:57,556
So I looked like a wreck this morning.

1078
01:38:57,853 --> 01:39:02,515
It's clear that this would happen the night before our meeting.

1079
01:39:06,027 --> 01:39:11,816
You look so pretty... so beautiful, Marianne.

1080
01:39:12,116 --> 01:39:17,490
No compliments, please. Instead, show interest in my soul.

1081
01:39:17,788 --> 01:39:19,745
Go and sit down...

1082
01:39:28,798 --> 01:39:30,755
Take a seat...

1083
01:39:33,177 --> 01:39:35,134
Not...

1084
01:39:37,681 --> 01:39:40,931
Let me read to you.

1085
01:39:41,602 --> 01:39:45,515
One good thing does not have to exclude another.

1086
01:39:46,147 --> 01:39:48,223
I think of you all the time,

1087
01:39:48,524 --> 01:39:52,059
about having sex with you.

1088
01:39:52,361 --> 01:39:55,196
I have longed for you.

1089
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:58,739
But after you left,

1090
01:39:59,034 --> 01:40:03,494
I would long for you again.

1091
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,866
I love you, don't you realize that?

1092
01:40:11,170 --> 01:40:14,954
Sometimes I hate you for what you did to me.

1093
01:40:15,257 --> 01:40:21,508
I rejoice in every hour that passes without thinking of you.

1094
01:40:22,139 --> 01:40:26,087
I have friends, lovers, children

1095
01:40:26,393 --> 01:40:32,097
and a job that I enjoy and am good at.

1096
01:40:34,233 --> 01:40:36,024
And yet I am bound to you.

1097
01:40:36,318 --> 01:40:40,067
I don't know why.

1098
01:40:40,364 --> 01:40:43,530
Maybe I'm a masochist,

1099
01:40:43,825 --> 01:40:49,163
or I'm just a one-man woman.

1100
01:40:50,498 --> 01:40:53,284
I don't know...

1101
01:40:53,584 --> 01:40:56,585
It's all so difficult.

1102
01:40:58,588 --> 01:41:02,455
I don't want to live with anyone other than you.

1103
01:41:11,601 --> 01:41:14,554
Other men bore me.

1104
01:41:15,895 --> 01:41:20,308
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty,

1105
01:41:20,609 --> 01:41:25,650
or use emotional blackmail.

1106
01:41:25,947 --> 01:41:30,193
I'm just telling you how I feel.

1107
01:41:30,993 --> 01:41:37,077
I can't stand it when you sleep with me.

1108
01:41:38,416 --> 01:41:41,666
I can't explain it any other way.

1109
01:41:41,962 --> 01:41:44,582
It's because you're going to leave

1110
01:41:44,881 --> 01:41:48,748
and I will long for you.

1111
01:41:49,051 --> 01:41:55,588
I kind of enjoyed having you at a distance.

1112
01:41:56,349 --> 01:41:59,303
So let's keep our hands to ourselves.

1113
01:41:59,602 --> 01:42:04,348
You'll just leave me devastated.

1114
01:42:04,941 --> 01:42:10,730
I... I'm still in love with you.

1115
01:42:11,696 --> 01:42:13,191
Why say that if it is not true?

1116
01:42:13,491 --> 01:42:17,570
Do you think I didn't miss you?

1117
01:42:17,869 --> 01:42:23,823
I have... We were friends.

1118
01:42:24,125 --> 01:42:26,876
We had fun together.

1119
01:42:27,170 --> 01:42:32,080
If we want to have sex, why shouldn't we do it?

1120
01:42:32,382 --> 01:42:35,052
Why are there all these reservations?

1121
01:42:35,343 --> 01:42:39,258
Why worry about how you'll feel tomorrow?

1122
01:42:39,556 --> 01:42:43,422
No, Johan...

1123
01:42:43,726 --> 01:42:47,142
I want you to stop!

1124
01:42:47,438 --> 01:42:53,974
I don't want to brood, pine, and cry about you!

1125
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:59,946
If you insist, you can just leave.

1126
01:43:00,242 --> 01:43:01,866
I don't want to sleep with you.

1127
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:05,575
Please try to understand this!

1128
01:43:09,542 --> 01:43:12,957
I do my best ...

1129
01:43:25,306 --> 01:43:28,306
Okay, I'll sit here...

1130
01:43:31,478 --> 01:43:36,354
I'm sitting here and you can read to me.

1131
01:43:36,650 --> 01:43:42,770
Then I go home, call Paula and tell her that I was at the theater.

1132
01:43:59,962 --> 01:44:03,746
Can I have another coffee and a brandy, please?

1133
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:39,286
I feel like a terrible idiot.

1134
01:44:40,374 --> 01:44:42,996
I want to hide somewhere and cry.

1135
01:44:49,966 --> 01:44:56,929
- We can meet tomorrow instead. - Yes, that might be just as good.

1136
01:44:57,223 --> 01:45:00,093
No, it's better if you stay...

1137
01:45:00,392 --> 01:45:03,393
I'm busy tomorrow.

1138
01:45:07,399 --> 01:45:09,557
Hello...

1139
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:15,071
I like you so much.

1140
01:45:16,657 --> 01:45:21,485
I behave like a child.

1141
01:45:21,787 --> 01:45:24,704
The situation is under control.

1142
01:45:25,624 --> 01:45:28,411
We have overcome the crisis.

1143
01:45:33,256 --> 01:45:36,790
I can barely read my own writing.

1144
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:42,632
The beginning is not important...

1145
01:45:43,349 --> 01:45:47,596
“Yesterday I was overcome by a carefree cheerfulness.”

1146
01:45:47,895 --> 01:45:52,556
For the first time this year, I felt joy in life.

1147
01:45:52,857 --> 01:45:56,606
“I’m excited to see what the day will bring.”

1148
01:45:56,903 --> 01:45:58,860
And so forth...

1149
01:46:00,989 --> 01:46:02,982
Here it is:

1150
01:46:05,911 --> 01:46:10,786
“I turned around and looked at the photo of my class at school.”

1151
01:46:11,917 --> 01:46:14,489
taken when I was 10.

1152
01:46:14,794 --> 01:46:20,914
I seemed to discover something I had missed before.

1153
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:26,422
To my surprise, I have to admit,

1154
01:46:26,722 --> 01:46:30,422
I don't know who I am.

1155
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:33,307
Not at all...

1156
01:46:34,812 --> 01:46:39,521
I always did what I was told.

1157
01:46:39,817 --> 01:46:41,608
As far as I can remember,

1158
01:46:42,278 --> 01:46:47,948
I was obedient, balanced, almost gentle.

1159
01:46:48,241 --> 01:46:55,203
I have asserted myself as a girl once or twice,

1160
01:46:55,498 --> 01:47:01,002
but Mother punished all such violations of the Convention

1161
01:47:01,294 --> 01:47:05,162
with exemplary rigor.

1162
01:47:05,673 --> 01:47:09,007
My entire upbringing

1163
01:47:09,302 --> 01:47:14,296
aimed to make me agreeable.

1164
01:47:14,598 --> 01:47:17,931
I was ugly and clumsy.

1165
01:47:18,227 --> 01:47:22,604
A fact I was constantly reminded of.

1166
01:47:22,898 --> 01:47:28,188
But if I kept my thoughts to myself

1167
01:47:28,486 --> 01:47:32,649
and was ingratiating,

1168
01:47:32,948 --> 01:47:36,780
my behavior was rewarded.

1169
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:43,824
The actual deception began in puberty.

1170
01:47:44,126 --> 01:47:49,914
All my thoughts revolved around sex.

1171
01:47:50,715 --> 01:47:55,257
But I never told my parents that,

1172
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:58,672
or anyone for that matter.

1173
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:03,476
Be deceitful and mysterious

1174
01:48:03,769 --> 01:48:08,264
has become second nature to me.

1175
01:48:08,564 --> 01:48:11,814
My father wanted me to become a lawyer like him.

1176
01:48:12,568 --> 01:48:17,064
I said I wanted to be an actress,

1177
01:48:17,364 --> 01:48:22,784
or do something else in the theatre world,

1178
01:48:23,078 --> 01:48:25,200
but they laughed at me.

1179
01:48:25,496 --> 01:48:29,115
Since then I've been pretending.

1180
01:48:29,417 --> 01:48:32,453
A deception in my relationships with others.

1181
01:48:32,753 --> 01:48:35,291
For men.

1182
01:48:35,589 --> 01:48:38,127
The same deception -

1183
01:48:38,425 --> 01:48:42,125
a desperate attempt to please.

1184
01:48:43,346 --> 01:48:47,558
I never thought about what I wanted.

1185
01:48:47,850 --> 01:48:54,683
Only: “What does he want me to think?”

1186
01:48:54,982 --> 01:48:59,311
It is not selflessness, as I always believed,

1187
01:48:59,611 --> 01:49:02,814
but pure cowardice.

1188
01:49:03,114 --> 01:49:07,064
It comes from the fact that I don't know who I am.

1189
01:49:07,702 --> 01:49:12,696
Our mistake was that we did not break away from our families.

1190
01:49:12,999 --> 01:49:19,332
“and to create something valuable according to our own ideas.”

1191
01:50:01,084 --> 01:50:03,160
Oh damn, I fell asleep!

1192
01:50:03,461 --> 01:50:07,044
Your words were also very interesting. Forgive me...

1193
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:14,220
Would you rather not read on unless you feel offended?

1194
01:50:14,513 --> 01:50:20,633
I'm not offended, but I think you should go home now.

1195
01:50:20,936 --> 01:50:23,936
Yes, I'd better go.

1196
01:50:28,443 --> 01:50:34,729
Please call, if only for the sake of the children.

1197
01:50:35,032 --> 01:50:40,073
- You're always welcome here. - If only Paula wasn't so jealous.

1198
01:50:40,370 --> 01:50:43,786
Nevertheless, she has good reasons …

1199
01:50:44,582 --> 01:50:48,626
- When will you hear about the USA? - In about a month.

1200
01:50:48,919 --> 01:50:53,580
- Let me know how it went. - Of course I'll call you.

1201
01:50:53,883 --> 01:50:58,425
We need to be clear about the divorce.

1202
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:02,254
- Do you want to get married again? - I don't know.

1203
01:51:02,556 --> 01:51:06,720
I'd rather wait, what do you think?

1204
01:51:07,019 --> 01:51:10,020
I don't know what to think...

1205
01:51:43,803 --> 01:51:49,508
- You're staying overnight, aren't you? - Yes.

1206
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,339
- How are you feeling? - Anxious...

1207
01:52:23,631 --> 01:52:27,046
Let us gather our courage.

1208
01:53:00,415 --> 01:53:04,459
- Can't you sleep? - No chance.

1209
01:53:04,751 --> 01:53:08,168
I'd better go home. Forgive me!

1210
01:53:38,950 --> 01:53:41,357
- That's Paula's handwriting. - She wrote to me.

1211
01:53:41,661 --> 01:53:45,444
- What's she up to now? - She sent this before she left.

1212
01:53:45,748 --> 01:53:49,827
Read it here.

1213
01:53:57,425 --> 01:54:02,170
“Dear Marianne, I assure you”

1214
01:54:02,471 --> 01:54:05,176
that there are no ulterior motives behind this letter.

1215
01:54:05,474 --> 01:54:07,929
I accepted this job in London

1216
01:54:08,227 --> 01:54:12,520
to break a vicious cycle of jealousy and mistrust.

1217
01:54:12,814 --> 01:54:17,060
I know Johan will visit you as soon as I'm gone.

1218
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:22,698
I can only blame myself for preventing him from seeing all of you.

1219
01:54:22,990 --> 01:54:27,070
“If only it were possible to put things right.”

1220
01:54:27,369 --> 01:54:32,364
- How typical Paula! - She wants us to be friends.

1221
01:54:32,666 --> 01:54:38,538
- She can't stand hostility. - How touching. And you believe her?

1222
01:54:44,051 --> 01:54:49,970
“Johan is the gentlest and kindest person I have ever met.”

1223
01:54:50,306 --> 01:54:53,307
He lacks self-confidence,

1224
01:54:53,602 --> 01:54:58,477
"even though he tries to seem so brave and cheerful."

1225
01:55:01,067 --> 01:55:07,650
You can say anything about anyone. In a certain sense, it always fits.

1226
01:55:54,115 --> 01:55:56,652
THE ANALPHITIZED

1227
01:55:56,951 --> 01:56:01,909
I'm glad we were able to meet here. It saves time.

1228
01:56:02,205 --> 01:56:08,041
- It's not exactly comfortable. - But suitable for divorce cases.

1229
01:56:08,336 --> 01:56:14,456
Here is the agreement, word for word, as we decided on it.

1230
01:56:14,758 --> 01:56:20,097
- Then I don't have to read it. - Always read before signing.

1231
01:56:20,389 --> 01:56:24,766
- Don't look so grumpy. - I'm not grumpy.

1232
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:31,263
Here is the list of our common property and its distribution.

1233
01:56:31,566 --> 01:56:36,027
This is just a list; no signature is required.

1234
01:56:50,875 --> 01:56:56,498
You got Grandma's watch? There must be a mistake.

1235
01:56:56,797 --> 01:57:02,550
- But she left it to me. - I don't remember that.

1236
01:57:02,844 --> 01:57:07,422
If you're so attached to it, keep it, but it's mine.

1237
01:57:07,724 --> 01:57:11,887
You're always right, aren't you? Take the damn watch!

1238
01:57:12,562 --> 01:57:17,851
- Check if I haven't duped you. - Your sarcasm is wasted on me.

1239
01:57:18,149 --> 01:57:20,356
I have such a bad cold.

1240
01:57:20,652 --> 01:57:24,484
How about a glass of fine old brandy?

1241
01:57:24,739 --> 01:57:26,981
Yes, I think we should have one now.

1242
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:30,735
Egerman gave me a bottle.

1243
01:57:31,037 --> 01:57:37,205
A few grateful Parisian colleagues gave him a whole case. Cheers!

1244
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:46,541
Not bad, right? I like it.

1245
01:57:46,843 --> 01:57:52,003
I don't usually like brandy, but this is good.

1246
01:57:52,306 --> 01:57:55,556
I already feel better.

1247
01:58:01,689 --> 01:58:04,015
It's still hard.

1248
01:58:04,317 --> 01:58:07,686
- Get divorced. - It's just paperwork.

1249
01:58:08,988 --> 01:58:14,195
We have been living apart for ages and we agree,

1250
01:58:14,493 --> 01:58:18,241
but the guilt remains.

1251
01:58:18,539 --> 01:58:22,370
It's strange... Johan?

1252
01:58:22,667 --> 01:58:26,830
- What? - It's strange.

1253
01:58:27,129 --> 01:58:34,046
On the way there, I was determined not to cry.

1254
01:58:34,345 --> 01:58:37,345
You said you felt guilty.

1255
01:58:39,432 --> 01:58:42,802
Let's go to the couch instead.

1256
01:58:43,103 --> 01:58:46,886
Turn off the light, the bright glare is horrible.

1257
01:58:47,190 --> 01:58:51,187
How can you work in such a desolate space?

1258
01:58:51,485 --> 01:58:53,810
The sofa isn't very comfortable either.

1259
01:58:54,113 --> 01:58:57,113
If you put your feet up, it's okay.

1260
01:58:57,407 --> 01:59:01,275
- More brandy? - Yes, please.

1261
01:59:04,330 --> 01:59:07,533
- Comfortable? - Very.

1262
01:59:09,710 --> 01:59:14,372
- Is the whole place empty? - There's a night watchman.

1263
01:59:14,673 --> 01:59:17,343
How nice!

1264
01:59:17,634 --> 01:59:21,846
- I just think it's nice. - Nothing's nice when you have a cold.

1265
01:59:22,139 --> 01:59:28,259
Stop feeling sorry for yourself. You're not going to die. Cheers!

1266
01:59:29,426 --> 01:59:35,595
- This just keeps getting better. - Aren't you in a good mood?

1267
01:59:36,298 --> 01:59:38,919
Honestly, I'm in love.

1268
01:59:39,571 --> 01:59:45,110
- With this David? - No, that's over.

1269
01:59:45,409 --> 01:59:48,079
Give me a kiss.

1270
01:59:48,370 --> 01:59:51,786
- But I'm sick. - I'll never catch your germs.

1271
01:59:52,083 --> 01:59:55,498
Give me a kiss, I want you to.

1272
02:00:22,902 --> 02:00:27,315
- Was it what you expected? - Much better.

1273
02:00:27,615 --> 02:00:31,030
Now put your hand on my chest.

1274
02:00:31,327 --> 02:00:35,988
- Are you seducing me? - That's true.

1275
02:00:36,289 --> 02:00:41,995
Right here on the carpet. Right now.

1276
02:00:42,295 --> 02:00:45,212
Doesn't that sound funny?

1277
02:00:45,506 --> 02:00:49,170
You look suspicious. Afraid of the night watchman?

1278
02:00:49,468 --> 02:00:52,801
After all, we're still married.

1279
02:00:57,309 --> 02:01:00,724
Come, lie on me.

1280
02:01:05,774 --> 02:01:10,851
People should make love on the floor more often.

1281
02:01:12,489 --> 02:01:16,818
- Lock the door. - No one will surprise us.

1282
02:01:17,118 --> 02:01:22,360
- I'm a bit of a prudish person. - Just in case the security guard comes.

1283
02:01:22,665 --> 02:01:28,287
- He could be eavesdropping. - No, he's making his rounds.

1284
02:01:28,588 --> 02:01:31,672
Is it advisable to take off your pants when you have this cold?

1285
02:01:31,965 --> 02:01:37,421
- You can warm me up. - So your thing doesn't freeze...

1286
02:01:42,517 --> 02:01:47,854
Poor baby, you are so unhappy...

1287
02:01:48,147 --> 02:01:51,895
It's nice to be kissed by you.

1288
02:01:52,192 --> 02:01:55,146
I'm having so much fun...

1289
02:01:57,322 --> 02:01:59,480
What if...?

1290
02:02:19,258 --> 02:02:21,085
Close your eyes,

1291
02:02:21,386 --> 02:02:24,801
or I will feel insecure.

1292
02:02:28,767 --> 02:02:32,764
Put your hands on my hips.

1293
02:02:34,105 --> 02:02:36,478
That is nice...

1294
02:02:39,444 --> 02:02:43,571
What if the guard came in now?

1295
02:02:43,864 --> 02:02:49,368
He could join us. We are free.

1296
02:02:52,372 --> 02:02:55,705
Let's stay here all night...

1297
02:02:56,376 --> 02:03:00,919
...and just drink and make love.

1298
02:03:04,300 --> 02:03:08,760
Tomorrow we will file our divorce papers.

1299
02:03:28,780 --> 02:03:33,488
A penny for your thoughts.

1300
02:03:33,785 --> 02:03:35,410
I won't tell.

1301
02:03:36,579 --> 02:03:40,707
- Are you hungry? - I always am.

1302
02:03:40,999 --> 02:03:45,744
How about a steak tartare and some beer?

1303
02:03:46,046 --> 02:03:49,047
You shouldn't take me out.

1304
02:03:49,341 --> 02:03:52,211
I am in Uppsala with my students.

1305
02:03:52,510 --> 02:03:54,052
Arm Paula!

1306
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:58,884
In that case, I would like to have dinner with you.

1307
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:05,307
- Where is the bathroom? - Down the hall, on the left.

1308
02:04:17,784 --> 02:04:21,234
Let's sign these papers and go out and celebrate.

1309
02:04:21,537 --> 02:04:24,988
Pay tribute to a long and happy marriage.

1310
02:04:25,290 --> 02:04:28,741
I think I'll take it home.

1311
02:04:29,043 --> 02:04:32,662
Why turn around now?

1312
02:04:32,964 --> 02:04:37,672
You yourself said that you should read things thoroughly before signing.

1313
02:04:37,968 --> 02:04:43,307
Let’s read it from A to Z,

1314
02:04:43,599 --> 02:04:46,848
So you see, I didn't cheat you.

1315
02:04:47,143 --> 02:04:51,390
- Why are you so upset? - I'm not. Let's get started.

1316
02:04:51,689 --> 02:04:56,600
- You look angry to me. - I am, but I'll control myself.

1317
02:04:56,903 --> 02:05:01,897
As I always do when I am subjected to your whims.

1318
02:05:02,199 --> 02:05:05,235
Can we end this boring discussion?

1319
02:05:05,535 --> 02:05:09,319
It's late and tomorrow is a work day.

1320
02:05:09,622 --> 02:05:13,156
- Wouldn't you like to have dinner? - No, thank you.

1321
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:17,042
I am grateful for the favors shown to me.

1322
02:05:17,337 --> 02:05:21,501
- Speaking of moods... - Now look here, Johan!

1323
02:05:26,221 --> 02:05:31,559
It is pointless to even try to discuss this now.

1324
02:05:31,851 --> 02:05:37,438
Let's put these in an envelope so you can take them home.

1325
02:05:37,732 --> 02:05:41,811
Then you and Paula can go through the wording

1326
02:05:42,111 --> 02:05:45,147
to see that I haven't fooled you.

1327
02:05:45,947 --> 02:05:49,565
- What's going on? - Nothing.

1328
02:06:04,005 --> 02:06:06,876
A minute ago we were good friends.

1329
02:06:07,175 --> 02:06:10,341
Don't forget Eva's birthday.

1330
02:06:10,637 --> 02:06:16,057
- Do I usually do that? - No, because I always remind you.

1331
02:06:16,350 --> 02:06:20,478
Could you pay for her trip to France?

1332
02:06:20,770 --> 02:06:24,020
- How much is that? - 2,000 kroner.

1333
02:06:24,316 --> 02:06:29,191
That's out of the question!

1334
02:06:29,612 --> 02:06:36,445
- Then let your mother pay. - I've already borrowed too much.

1335
02:06:36,744 --> 02:06:39,531
I just paid Karin's orthodontist.

1336
02:06:39,830 --> 02:06:44,740
- Doesn't she get free dental care? - She refuses to go there.

1337
02:06:45,042 --> 02:06:48,791
Eva has to cancel her trip.

1338
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:53,086
It won't hurt her to learn that she can't have it all.

1339
02:06:53,384 --> 02:06:59,137
She's so spoiled and has too many bad manners!

1340
02:06:59,431 --> 02:07:04,971
- Mother was horrified last week. - Your mother told you that?

1341
02:07:05,270 --> 02:07:08,555
Well, Eva is at a difficult age.

1342
02:07:08,856 --> 02:07:11,976
Don't let the girls take over.

1343
02:07:12,276 --> 02:07:16,522
I have full confidence in her

1344
02:07:16,821 --> 02:07:19,229
and for that I am grateful.

1345
02:07:19,532 --> 02:07:23,530
I don't care about little things like manners.

1346
02:07:23,828 --> 02:07:27,362
I can't afford the trip. Tell her that.

1347
02:07:27,665 --> 02:07:30,868
- Tell her yourself. - Why? You have custody.

1348
02:07:31,168 --> 02:07:34,833
I just pay huge sums for child support,

1349
02:07:35,131 --> 02:07:38,131
lets me down.

1350
02:07:38,425 --> 02:07:41,876
You and I were born

1351
02:07:42,178 --> 02:07:46,342
with silver spoons in their mouths.

1352
02:07:46,641 --> 02:07:49,725
We have wasted our resources,

1353
02:07:50,018 --> 02:07:53,518
and leaves us poor, bitter and angry.

1354
02:07:53,814 --> 02:07:56,186
As trite as it may sound, it is the truth:

1355
02:07:57,025 --> 02:08:01,153
We are emotionally illiterate.

1356
02:08:01,446 --> 02:08:06,440
We learned about anatomy and African farming methods.

1357
02:08:06,743 --> 02:08:11,949
We memorized mathematical formulas.

1358
02:08:12,915 --> 02:08:17,244
We have not been taught anything about reason.

1359
02:08:17,544 --> 02:08:22,040
We don't know what motivates people.

1360
02:08:26,051 --> 02:08:29,884
This concludes my lecture.

1361
02:08:30,890 --> 02:08:36,725
More brandy? Then we can decide on dinner.

1362
02:08:41,483 --> 02:08:44,103
I do not agree with you.

1363
02:08:45,444 --> 02:08:50,070
By the way, this job was lost in the USA.

1364
02:08:51,366 --> 02:08:55,364
- Not that it matters. - What a pity!

1365
02:08:55,662 --> 02:08:57,619
Well, I was pretty disappointed.

1366
02:08:58,332 --> 02:09:01,332
There were the usual machinations.

1367
02:09:01,626 --> 02:09:07,213
First everything was postponed, then the money was missing...

1368
02:09:07,506 --> 02:09:12,464
Then they sent someone else. That's life. Cheers!

1369
02:09:23,479 --> 02:09:26,100
I'll be 45 this summer.

1370
02:09:28,484 --> 02:09:33,146
I can expect to live another 30 years...

1371
02:09:37,284 --> 02:09:41,744
Objectively speaking, I'm a burden.

1372
02:09:42,330 --> 02:09:48,202
I'm going to spend the next 20 years being a fucking nuisance.

1373
02:09:49,545 --> 02:09:55,417
I am an expensive, unproductive unit

1374
02:09:55,717 --> 02:09:59,133
that should be eliminated.

1375
02:10:01,473 --> 02:10:03,879
And I should be in my prime,

1376
02:10:04,183 --> 02:10:07,682
full of useful experiences!

1377
02:10:07,978 --> 02:10:11,062
“But the saying goes: ‘Throw out the loser.’”

1378
02:10:11,356 --> 02:10:14,771
"Let him go to the dogs."

1379
02:10:22,950 --> 02:10:27,576
I'm so damn tired.

1380
02:10:33,668 --> 02:10:36,420
I hardly know who I am.

1381
02:10:40,592 --> 02:10:45,253
Someone spat on me and now I'm drowning in saliva.

1382
02:10:45,554 --> 02:10:50,678
- Am I boring you? - It's funny...

1383
02:10:50,975 --> 02:10:57,512
I wanted to have sex with you today to see if I could feel anything.

1384
02:10:57,815 --> 02:11:01,813
I felt only lukewarm affection.

1385
02:11:03,654 --> 02:11:08,565
I think I can finally free myself.

1386
02:11:09,075 --> 02:11:12,658
It took a long time and was very painful,

1387
02:11:12,954 --> 02:11:18,873
but I am now free from you and can live my own life.

1388
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:21,457
Allow me to congratulate you.

1389
02:11:22,046 --> 02:11:28,498
It's heartless of me to say this when you're going through a difficult time.

1390
02:11:29,553 --> 02:11:31,545
but strangely enough, I don't care.

1391
02:11:31,847 --> 02:11:35,429
I have taken your feelings into account far too often.

1392
02:11:35,725 --> 02:11:39,343
Consideration destroyed our love.

1393
02:11:41,105 --> 02:11:45,317
If I hadn’t been distracted by feelings of guilt,

1394
02:11:45,609 --> 02:11:50,070
I would have known that everything we did was wrong.

1395
02:11:51,407 --> 02:11:54,157
Do you remember the time after Karin was born?

1396
02:11:54,451 --> 02:11:57,784
When we couldn't sleep together?

1397
02:11:58,079 --> 02:12:04,247
How we blame my two pregnancies.

1398
02:12:04,543 --> 02:12:11,423
We have come up with many reasons why our lovemaking didn't bring us joy.

1399
02:12:12,258 --> 02:12:17,383
Warning lights flashed all around us,

1400
02:12:17,680 --> 02:12:21,808
but we ignored them.

1401
02:12:22,101 --> 02:12:27,771
These autopsies are so pointless.

1402
02:12:31,984 --> 02:12:37,607
Your idiotic sarcasm is driving me crazy!

1403
02:12:37,906 --> 02:12:41,691
Why should you tell me what to think and feel?

1404
02:12:41,994 --> 02:12:45,113
Lord, how I hate you!

1405
02:12:45,413 --> 02:12:50,787
I often thought, “Lord, how I hate them!”

1406
02:12:51,085 --> 02:12:57,705
Especially when we loved each other and I felt your indifference

1407
02:12:58,634 --> 02:13:02,845
and when I saw you naked at the bidet afterwards –

1408
02:13:03,138 --> 02:13:09,507
I'm washing away the nasty stuff I've deposited inside you.

1409
02:13:11,646 --> 02:13:16,438
I thought, "I hate her body, the way she moves."

1410
02:13:16,734 --> 02:13:19,688
I should have hit you.

1411
02:13:20,237 --> 02:13:25,611
I wanted to crush your hard, white resistance,

1412
02:13:26,201 --> 02:13:31,954
but we chatted and talked about how well we get along.

1413
02:13:32,832 --> 02:13:37,161
So why do I enjoy sex now?

1414
02:13:37,795 --> 02:13:41,709
- I'll do whatever he asks. - Just wait.

1415
02:13:42,007 --> 02:13:47,926
If you are married to him, you will do the same thing again.

1416
02:13:48,221 --> 02:13:51,257
Their behavior is deeply rooted.

1417
02:13:51,557 --> 02:13:57,891
Then look for a new lover who will free you from your disgust.

1418
02:13:58,189 --> 02:14:00,560
You are wrong.

1419
02:14:00,857 --> 02:14:05,982
There is such a thing as direct tenderness.

1420
02:14:06,863 --> 02:14:10,777
Not to mention the sensuality

1421
02:14:11,075 --> 02:14:14,824
and physical desire.

1422
02:14:15,121 --> 02:14:18,122
For you, all of this is blocked.

1423
02:14:18,832 --> 02:14:24,253
Do you think I wasn't sorry when we didn't get along?

1424
02:14:25,129 --> 02:14:29,756
I thought, “Is this misery all there is?”

1425
02:14:31,135 --> 02:14:36,639
We consoled ourselves with the thought that sex isn't everything.

1426
02:14:36,932 --> 02:14:43,729
That we were otherwise happy. What self-deception!

1427
02:14:44,022 --> 02:14:46,774
They forget certain things.

1428
02:14:47,067 --> 02:14:49,522
Then please enlighten me.

1429
02:14:49,861 --> 02:14:54,688
They made money with their genitals.

1430
02:14:55,450 --> 02:14:57,856
They became a bargaining chip.

1431
02:14:58,160 --> 02:15:02,027
A night full of sex for a night full of peace.

1432
02:15:02,330 --> 02:15:04,952
Good behavior got me fucked.

1433
02:15:05,250 --> 02:15:08,915
Bad behavior or criticism

1434
02:15:08,940 --> 02:15:11,181
forced you to retreat.

1435
02:15:11,478 --> 02:15:14,598
You were worse than any whore!

1436
02:15:14,909 --> 02:15:20,828
- You would never face the truth. - Some cosmic truth or your truth?

1437
02:15:21,223 --> 02:15:26,098
How you made me your doormat!

1438
02:15:26,294 --> 02:15:28,785
Am I a replacement for your mother?

1439
02:15:29,141 --> 02:15:32,676
All that whining about how I neglected the home.

1440
02:15:33,077 --> 02:15:34,656
That's a lie!

1441
02:15:34,944 --> 02:15:39,107
You have burdened me with guilt!

1442
02:15:39,299 --> 02:15:43,342
You and your parents!

1443
02:15:43,558 --> 02:15:46,559
I felt inadequate at work and at home

1444
02:15:46,941 --> 02:15:50,392
and I was also a lousy lover.

1445
02:15:50,597 --> 02:15:55,176
I was overwhelmed by all the whining and endless demands.

1446
02:15:55,478 --> 02:16:00,638
If I used my genitals, was that so strange?

1447
02:16:01,521 --> 02:16:03,312
I fought against hopeless odds:

1448
02:16:03,887 --> 02:16:08,963
You, my mother, your parents and society!

1449
02:16:09,267 --> 02:16:15,055
When I think about what I endured, I could scream!

1450
02:16:15,356 --> 02:16:19,982
I tell you: never again!

1451
02:16:20,277 --> 02:16:24,820
They sit there and complain about conspiracies.

1452
02:16:25,114 --> 02:16:28,779
Serves you damn right!

1453
02:16:29,077 --> 02:16:31,994
I hope it gets rammed down your throat

1454
02:16:32,288 --> 02:16:34,778
that you are a useless parasite.

1455
02:16:35,082 --> 02:16:40,158
- You're absolutely grotesque! - You made me this way!

1456
02:16:41,505 --> 02:16:45,716
The difference between us is that I fight against it!

1457
02:16:46,009 --> 02:16:50,717
I intend to face reality as it is.

1458
02:16:51,514 --> 02:16:56,508
If there is one thing I truly value, it is being alive.

1459
02:16:56,810 --> 02:16:59,383
I enjoy overcoming difficulties.

1460
02:16:59,688 --> 02:17:03,555
- I'm not asking for any special compensation. - How nice!

1461
02:17:03,858 --> 02:17:09,564
Then we don't need to feel sorry for each other.

1462
02:17:09,864 --> 02:17:12,983
We become quite human.

1463
02:17:13,283 --> 02:17:16,699
It's a pity we ever met

1464
02:17:16,995 --> 02:17:22,369
and decided to live together – what a glorious fiasco!

1465
02:17:23,210 --> 02:17:25,996
The sooner we sign the papers, the better.

1466
02:17:26,296 --> 02:17:29,747
We will divide our worldly goods and go our separate ways.

1467
02:17:30,049 --> 02:17:32,718
It was all just a terrible mistake.

1468
02:17:33,010 --> 02:17:36,295
I know what you're thinking.

1469
02:17:36,972 --> 02:17:40,341
- You don't want a divorce! - That's absurd!

1470
02:17:40,558 --> 02:17:46,015
- Then sign the papers. - Okay, I will.

1471
02:17:46,605 --> 02:17:50,354
Now be honest... look at me!

1472
02:17:51,777 --> 02:17:57,363
You don't want a divorce, do you?

1473
02:17:57,657 --> 02:18:00,861
Would that be such a crime?

1474
02:18:01,161 --> 02:18:05,454
I admit defeat. Is that what you want to hear?

1475
02:18:05,748 --> 02:18:08,500
I'm sick of Paula.

1476
02:18:08,793 --> 02:18:11,959
I want to come home.

1477
02:18:13,339 --> 02:18:17,003
Don't look at me like that.

1478
02:18:22,430 --> 02:18:25,715
I'm a failure. I'm going downhill.

1479
02:18:26,016 --> 02:18:29,551
I am afraid and helpless.

1480
02:18:31,772 --> 02:18:34,975
My timing is completely wrong...

1481
02:18:35,275 --> 02:18:41,312
- If you think that pity helps... - I will give you a clear answer.

1482
02:18:44,283 --> 02:18:49,823
I was connected to you in a deeper way than I knew.

1483
02:18:51,957 --> 02:18:54,874
I needed our home

1484
02:18:56,670 --> 02:18:59,290
and lead a normal life.

1485
02:19:03,092 --> 02:19:05,049
I'm tired of being alone.

1486
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:08,547
Loneliness with Paula is worse than being completely alone.

1487
02:19:08,848 --> 02:19:11,219
I can't stand it either.

1488
02:19:14,602 --> 02:19:19,145
I won't continue... Now you know.

1489
02:19:32,870 --> 02:19:37,946
Please send a taxi to Malmrosgatan 45.

1490
02:19:40,126 --> 02:19:43,126
Do you want a ride? You really shouldn't drive.

1491
02:19:43,421 --> 02:19:48,759
- I'll stay here for a while. - Please don't brood.

1492
02:19:48,967 --> 02:19:50,378
That does not concern you!

1493
02:19:51,845 --> 02:19:55,889
- I want you to stay. - But I don't want to.

1494
02:19:56,182 --> 02:19:59,966
You're tired and drunk. Let me go.

1495
02:20:00,686 --> 02:20:05,348
- I don't want you to leave. - Don't be silly.

1496
02:20:06,275 --> 02:20:10,486
We've never behaved like this before. Give me the key.

1497
02:20:10,779 --> 02:20:14,195
I don't give a shit what you say.

1498
02:20:18,328 --> 02:20:22,111
Her orderly mind is shaken.

1499
02:20:22,414 --> 02:20:23,873
“What do I do now?”

1500
02:20:24,875 --> 02:20:27,331
“Has he gone crazy?”

1501
02:20:27,628 --> 02:20:30,877
“Will he hit me?”

1502
02:20:31,172 --> 02:20:35,004
Actually, you're quite a troublemaker.

1503
02:20:37,303 --> 02:20:41,348
Then why don't you laugh?

1504
02:20:41,640 --> 02:20:44,131
You look scared to me.

1505
02:20:44,435 --> 02:20:47,885
Let me cancel the taxi...

1506
02:20:51,441 --> 02:20:53,398
For what reason?

1507
02:20:55,361 --> 02:20:59,229
You only wait about 10 minutes.

1508
02:20:59,532 --> 02:21:01,156
Sit down and relax.

1509
02:21:02,201 --> 02:21:07,574
- That'll take quite a while. - Good...

1510
02:21:08,248 --> 02:21:11,913
- So, what do you want to say? - Nothing.

1511
02:21:14,295 --> 02:21:18,162
- I want to look at you. - Go on.

1512
02:21:19,008 --> 02:21:23,385
I should have expected that.

1513
02:21:23,679 --> 02:21:27,094
I have often warned wives in the divorce process

1514
02:21:27,391 --> 02:21:32,515
against spending time alone with their husbands.

1515
02:21:32,812 --> 02:21:36,145
And yet I am here.

1516
02:21:36,441 --> 02:21:38,398
Shut your mouth!

1517
02:21:40,194 --> 02:21:46,730
I'm not afraid, I don't care what you do.

1518
02:21:48,368 --> 02:21:51,702
-Shut up, I said! -You crazy man!

1519
02:22:31,282 --> 02:22:36,407
Give me the key, I'll go and wash off the blood.

1520
02:22:37,288 --> 02:22:39,197
I won't let you out.

1521
02:22:39,832 --> 02:22:43,911
- You asshole! - You bitch!

1522
02:22:44,210 --> 02:22:46,583
I'll show you!

1523
02:22:49,674 --> 02:22:53,423
I could kill you! I could kill you!

1524
02:23:06,648 --> 02:23:09,103
Oh, Marianne ...

1525
02:23:10,026 --> 02:23:14,487
Listen, are you okay?

1526
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:23,203
I guess I can only blame myself...

1527
02:23:25,124 --> 02:23:28,539
Will you give me the key now?

1528
02:23:39,970 --> 02:23:44,133
- Should I help you? - No, don't come near me.

1529
02:24:37,147 --> 02:24:41,975
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IN A DARK HOUSE

1530
02:26:21,868 --> 02:26:24,538
What fun this is!

1531
02:26:26,372 --> 02:26:30,915
I went to the cottage yesterday and turned on the heating

1532
02:26:31,210 --> 02:26:36,416
and stocked up on food, just like in the old days.

1533
02:26:36,924 --> 02:26:42,796
- When did I last see the place? - Seven years ago.

1534
02:26:44,139 --> 02:26:47,305
- And you? - I don't spend much time there.

1535
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:51,182
Henrik doesn't like the sea.

1536
02:26:51,478 --> 02:26:55,725
The girls and I go there occasionally,

1537
02:26:56,024 --> 02:26:59,974
but they have to live their own lives.

1538
02:27:00,278 --> 02:27:03,397
- How is your husband? - Revised.

1539
02:27:03,698 --> 02:27:07,316
He suffers from high blood pressure.

1540
02:27:07,910 --> 02:27:11,777
- How is your wife? - She's in Italy to recover.

1541
02:27:12,497 --> 02:27:16,032
Strange that they're both abroad.

1542
02:27:16,335 --> 02:27:19,086
I think that's almost indecent.

1543
02:27:20,087 --> 02:27:23,088
That's the beauty.

1544
02:27:41,816 --> 02:27:45,350
- The place hasn't changed much. - It's a bit shabby.

1545
02:27:45,653 --> 02:27:50,113
It needs renovation, but we can't afford it.

1546
02:27:55,704 --> 02:28:01,539
Park the car, otherwise Erik will see it and come right over.

1547
02:28:02,084 --> 02:28:06,296
- This could be embarrassing. - I will, darling...

1548
02:28:10,384 --> 02:28:15,460
- Won't you do it now? - No, later.

1549
02:28:42,330 --> 02:28:45,533
This feels a little strange...

1550
02:28:48,585 --> 02:28:52,001
Let's stretch out on the bed...

1551
02:28:54,716 --> 02:28:59,757
I'm nervous. It's like the first time.

1552
02:29:00,054 --> 02:29:02,426
But that's not it.

1553
02:29:12,482 --> 02:29:15,020
It's been almost a year now.

1554
02:29:15,902 --> 02:29:19,603
It was the day before my birthday

1555
02:29:20,239 --> 02:29:22,315
and today is August 28th.

1556
02:29:23,284 --> 02:29:27,233
You seduced me.

1557
02:29:27,538 --> 02:29:31,915
Have you ever seen the last act of this play?

1558
02:29:32,209 --> 02:29:35,908
It must have looked strange how we sneaked away like that.

1559
02:29:36,171 --> 02:29:40,417
- What prompted you to make this decision? - I don't know...

1560
02:29:40,967 --> 02:29:44,798
I saw you the second I walked into the theater.

1561
02:29:45,596 --> 02:29:50,423
It seemed natural to approach you.

1562
02:29:50,725 --> 02:29:53,395
I was terribly pleased.

1563
02:29:53,686 --> 02:29:56,521
Something like that l.

1564
02:29:56,814 --> 02:30:01,143
“– And you said, ‘Let’s go.’ – And you blushed.”

1565
02:30:01,443 --> 02:30:07,897
- No wonder. I had such a hard-on. - You made me pretty hot, too.

1566
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:10,322
We hadn't seen each other for two whole years.

1567
02:30:10,703 --> 02:30:12,742
That's right, exactly two years.

1568
02:30:13,705 --> 02:30:16,622
And today is our first anniversary.

1569
02:30:16,916 --> 02:30:19,407
NO...

1570
02:30:20,336 --> 02:30:23,586
It's not our first anniversary.

1571
02:30:23,880 --> 02:30:26,372
It's our 20th.

1572
02:30:26,675 --> 02:30:32,261
We got married 20 years ago in August.

1573
02:30:32,555 --> 02:30:36,220
It's a whole life.

1574
02:30:36,417 --> 02:30:40,580
A whole adult life together.

1575
02:30:40,932 --> 02:30:43,304
Isn't that strange?

1576
02:30:47,277 --> 02:30:51,855
My love! Darling...

1577
02:30:52,157 --> 02:30:58,989
It's this miserable old bed...

1578
02:31:00,665 --> 02:31:05,622
Our hotel rooms were accordingly impersonal.

1579
02:31:06,629 --> 02:31:08,621
It was wrong of us to come here.

1580
02:31:08,922 --> 02:31:12,706
- We should have gone to Denmark. - There was no time for that.

1581
02:31:13,009 --> 02:31:16,129
- That's fine. - No, it's not.

1582
02:31:17,513 --> 02:31:20,846
I'll call Fredrik. He has a vacation home.

1583
02:31:21,141 --> 02:31:26,052
- How do we get in? - I assume a neighbor has a key.

1584
02:31:26,355 --> 02:31:29,355
It can't hurt to try.

1585
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:38,862
Fredrik? It's me, Johan.

1586
02:31:39,158 --> 02:31:43,736
How are you? I've never felt better.

1587
02:31:44,037 --> 02:31:48,913
Look, this is a pretty delicate matter. Are you alone?

1588
02:31:49,876 --> 02:31:54,288
Could I perhaps borrow your cottage for the weekend?

1589
02:31:56,549 --> 02:32:00,297
Exactly, something like that...

1590
02:32:00,803 --> 02:32:03,839
Very pretty. Young...?

1591
02:32:04,139 --> 02:32:07,757
She's almost too young!

1592
02:32:08,059 --> 02:32:10,467
It's a delicate situation.

1593
02:32:10,770 --> 02:32:13,475
That's great!

1594
02:32:13,773 --> 02:32:16,145
I owe you a favor.

1595
02:32:16,900 --> 02:32:19,605
Don't say a word to Birgit now.

1596
02:32:19,903 --> 02:32:23,486
Women don't understand these things.

1597
02:32:23,782 --> 02:32:28,740
Right... The key is under the stone step.

1598
02:32:29,496 --> 02:32:31,571
And... Blonde.

1599
02:32:31,873 --> 02:32:35,573
With a great figure...

1600
02:32:36,585 --> 02:32:41,412
I'll call you. I really appreciate it.

1601
02:32:42,382 --> 02:32:48,669
Thanks. Say hello to Birgit for me. No, delete the last suggestion.

1602
02:32:50,514 --> 02:32:53,599
- I found it. - It's beautiful!

1603
02:32:57,604 --> 02:33:01,020
Here's the step. It has to be here.

1604
02:33:45,273 --> 02:33:48,357
- Let's clear this up. - Good.

1605
02:34:43,702 --> 02:34:47,651
What's wrong? You're crying.

1606
02:34:47,955 --> 02:34:52,083
You're so touching. I'm silly.

1607
02:34:52,376 --> 02:34:54,618
Touching? That's incredible.

1608
02:34:55,378 --> 02:34:56,873
It's the truth.

1609
02:34:58,548 --> 02:35:01,300
My dear, beloved Johan...

1610
02:35:01,717 --> 02:35:04,754
You have become so small.

1611
02:35:05,055 --> 02:35:10,677
You look so good like this.

1612
02:35:11,185 --> 02:35:15,645
You always looked so tense.

1613
02:35:17,774 --> 02:35:22,519
- Are people mean to you? - I don't know.

1614
02:35:23,154 --> 02:35:26,487
I'm no longer on the defensive.

1615
02:35:26,782 --> 02:35:32,536
Someone said I had become careless and gave in too quickly.

1616
02:35:33,121 --> 02:35:36,621
I have accepted my true dimensions

1617
02:35:36,917 --> 02:35:40,866
with a certain humility.

1618
02:35:41,754 --> 02:35:43,830
It makes me friendly and sad.

1619
02:35:44,132 --> 02:35:46,669
And you with your great expectations.

1620
02:35:46,884 --> 02:35:52,470
These were my family's expectations.

1621
02:35:52,723 --> 02:35:55,889
I really wanted to do them justice.

1622
02:35:57,853 --> 02:36:01,102
You wanted to know something about my husband?

1623
02:36:01,397 --> 02:36:04,813
Getting married was a mistake.

1624
02:36:07,319 --> 02:36:10,273
It was more of a joke.

1625
02:36:10,572 --> 02:36:12,814
When did you meet?

1626
02:36:14,075 --> 02:36:15,486
A few years ago.

1627
02:36:20,790 --> 02:36:25,866
It was a purely sexual matter.

1628
02:36:27,254 --> 02:36:29,212
I understand...

1629
02:36:31,675 --> 02:36:35,589
Henrik is... How should I say this?

1630
02:36:36,346 --> 02:36:38,837
Very convincing in this respect.

1631
02:36:39,307 --> 02:36:42,426
He really enjoys sex

1632
02:36:42,726 --> 02:36:48,231
and he made me realize that I felt the same way.

1633
02:36:48,858 --> 02:36:53,151
I wasn't that excited before.

1634
02:36:53,445 --> 02:36:56,481
I remember.

1635
02:36:57,365 --> 02:36:59,691
You don't like this topic, do you?

1636
02:36:59,909 --> 02:37:04,452
But it cannot be changed.

1637
02:37:08,668 --> 02:37:13,708
I was obsessed with this new sensation.

1638
02:37:15,673 --> 02:37:18,674
I felt insatiable.

1639
02:37:18,969 --> 02:37:23,630
How nice... for you.

1640
02:37:27,601 --> 02:37:31,599
I have grown very fond of Henrik

1641
02:37:32,230 --> 02:37:34,899
and he liked me very much,

1642
02:37:36,359 --> 02:37:41,435
but I caught him with other women.

1643
02:37:41,739 --> 02:37:43,696
What do you know?

1644
02:37:44,283 --> 02:37:50,570
I was hurt and humiliated, even jealous.

1645
02:37:51,373 --> 02:37:54,872
Are you jealous?

1646
02:37:55,169 --> 02:38:00,956
We had a violent scene and I told him to go to hell.

1647
02:38:01,257 --> 02:38:07,010
- And did he? - Yes.

1648
02:38:07,305 --> 02:38:10,922
He said I was too theatrical.

1649
02:38:13,184 --> 02:38:15,853
I begged him to come back.

1650
02:38:19,941 --> 02:38:23,938
You look absent-minded.

1651
02:38:24,236 --> 02:38:28,530
Everything is fine, that's all.

1652
02:38:28,824 --> 02:38:32,275
It simply couldn't be better.

1653
02:38:32,577 --> 02:38:37,155
- I just can't stand it. - I knew it!

1654
02:38:37,457 --> 02:38:43,245
As if I care about your orgasms with that workaholic.

1655
02:38:43,546 --> 02:38:46,914
I welcome your emancipation.

1656
02:38:47,216 --> 02:38:49,541
You should write a novel.

1657
02:38:49,843 --> 02:38:52,797
The women’s rights activists would be happy.

1658
02:38:53,304 --> 02:38:55,677
You're ridiculous...

1659
02:38:55,974 --> 02:38:58,512
I tell you, I don't give a shit.

1660
02:38:58,810 --> 02:39:01,810
It suddenly became so terribly important.

1661
02:39:03,035 --> 02:39:04,184
It's just a taste

1662
02:39:04,481 --> 02:39:08,893
the wonderful things that life has to offer.

1663
02:39:09,194 --> 02:39:13,690
Think of the awareness we have gained.

1664
02:39:13,990 --> 02:39:16,991
It's great!

1665
02:39:18,453 --> 02:39:20,824
We discovered ourselves.

1666
02:39:21,122 --> 02:39:26,116
One faces his insignificance, the other his greatness.

1667
02:39:26,418 --> 02:39:30,878
Here we are, badmouthing our spouses.

1668
02:39:31,172 --> 02:39:34,541
You are with us in this room.

1669
02:39:34,843 --> 02:39:38,176
This is crazy group sex taken to the extreme.

1670
02:39:38,471 --> 02:39:41,507
It's like a textbook about life.

1671
02:39:41,807 --> 02:39:47,560
It's fabulous, but I can't stand it.

1672
02:39:48,689 --> 02:39:53,564
I understand, but I don't think it's a bad thing.

1673
02:39:53,860 --> 02:39:58,071
I can't bear to have all my efforts cast under this cold light.

1674
02:39:58,364 --> 02:40:02,314
How I struggle with meaninglessness.

1675
02:40:02,993 --> 02:40:04,653
I try to cheer myself up and think

1676
02:40:04,954 --> 02:40:08,120
that life is what you make of it,

1677
02:40:08,415 --> 02:40:12,115
but these are empty words.

1678
02:40:12,586 --> 02:40:14,377
I want something to long for.

1679
02:40:14,670 --> 02:40:17,541
I don't feel that way.

1680
02:40:20,134 --> 02:40:22,126
I understand that.

1681
02:40:30,226 --> 02:40:32,018
I'm holding on.

1682
02:40:33,521 --> 02:40:35,893
I'm having fun.

1683
02:40:37,608 --> 02:40:40,774
I rely on common sense

1684
02:40:41,070 --> 02:40:43,904
and my gut feeling.

1685
02:40:44,281 --> 02:40:46,736
They work together.

1686
02:40:47,909 --> 02:40:50,531
I am happy with my direction.

1687
02:40:51,162 --> 02:40:55,207
Time has given me a third partner:

1688
02:40:56,251 --> 02:40:57,875
Experience.

1689
02:41:00,087 --> 02:41:02,210
They should become politicians.

1690
02:41:02,714 --> 02:41:05,288
Maybe you're right...

1691
02:41:09,053 --> 02:41:12,089
I like people.

1692
02:41:12,932 --> 02:41:15,553
I enjoy negotiations,

1693
02:41:15,852 --> 02:41:19,350
Prudence, compromises...

1694
02:41:19,646 --> 02:41:23,097
Are you rehearsing your election speech?

1695
02:41:23,400 --> 02:41:28,642
- Am I so impossible? - Only when you preach.

1696
02:41:28,946 --> 02:41:32,363
I won't say another word.

1697
02:41:36,829 --> 02:41:40,245
No more bitter truths?

1698
02:41:40,541 --> 02:41:42,367
I promise it.

1699
02:41:43,210 --> 02:41:48,369
Promise me you won't mention that orgasmic Superman again.

1700
02:41:49,716 --> 02:41:55,006
Promise to curb your terrible prudence.

1701
02:41:55,304 --> 02:41:59,135
It will be difficult, but I will try.

1702
02:41:59,432 --> 02:42:03,512
Could you possibly...

1703
02:42:03,865 --> 02:42:08,573
...use your feminine power sparingly?

1704
02:42:09,150 --> 02:42:11,308
I have to.

1705
02:42:12,695 --> 02:42:15,067
All right then...

1706
02:42:17,032 --> 02:42:19,191
Let's go to bed.

1707
02:43:03,033 --> 02:43:07,077
What is it? There, there...

1708
02:43:25,762 --> 02:43:29,889
Come, sit here with me.

1709
02:43:30,183 --> 02:43:32,554
Yes, yes...

1710
02:43:47,490 --> 02:43:53,076
What causes such nightmares?

1711
02:43:53,370 --> 02:43:57,831
- Maybe it was something you ate. - Do you think so?

1712
02:43:58,124 --> 02:44:02,453
Unless something else happens in your orderly world...

1713
02:44:02,754 --> 02:44:03,999
...that you can't reach.

1714
02:44:04,297 --> 02:44:06,254
Hold me, I'm shaking.

1715
02:44:06,549 --> 02:44:11,294
I think I caught something.

1716
02:44:11,595 --> 02:44:15,889
- The girls had a cold... - They'll feel better soon.

1717
02:44:16,183 --> 02:44:20,560
Pull up the blanket. That's nice...

1718
02:44:21,563 --> 02:44:24,268
What did you dream about?

1719
02:44:26,859 --> 02:44:31,984
We crossed a dangerous road.

1720
02:44:32,448 --> 02:44:37,689
I wanted you and the girls to hold on to me,

1721
02:44:37,995 --> 02:44:41,991
but my hands were gone.

1722
02:44:42,289 --> 02:44:46,999
All I had left were stumps

1723
02:44:47,295 --> 02:44:50,793
and I slide around in the soft sand.

1724
02:44:51,089 --> 02:44:56,084
You're on the road and I can't reach you...

1725
02:44:56,970 --> 02:44:59,378
What a terrible dream!

1726
02:45:02,183 --> 02:45:07,722
Do we live our lives in confusion?

1727
02:45:08,022 --> 02:45:12,434
- All of us. - What do you mean?

1728
02:45:13,068 --> 02:45:19,320
Fear, insecurity, lack of wisdom.

1729
02:45:20,117 --> 02:45:24,908
Let's slide downhill

1730
02:45:25,204 --> 02:45:27,243
and don't know what to do?

1731
02:45:27,915 --> 02:45:29,907
Yes, I think so.

1732
02:45:31,543 --> 02:45:34,248
Is it late?

1733
02:45:34,546 --> 02:45:36,503
Yes,

1734
02:45:36,798 --> 02:45:40,961
but we shouldn't say such things.

1735
02:45:42,261 --> 02:45:48,050
Johan, did we miss something important?

1736
02:45:48,350 --> 02:45:52,893
- All of us? - No, you and me.

1737
02:45:54,481 --> 02:45:59,439
Sometimes I can read your mind

1738
02:45:59,736 --> 02:46:01,977
and feel such tenderness.

1739
02:46:02,280 --> 02:46:07,025
I forget myself without losing myself.

1740
02:46:07,326 --> 02:46:12,486
It's a new sensation.

1741
02:46:12,790 --> 02:46:16,205
I understand.

1742
02:46:32,516 --> 02:46:37,806
It saddens me that I have never loved anyone.

1743
02:46:40,106 --> 02:46:43,889
I don't think I was ever loved either.

1744
02:46:45,652 --> 02:46:47,895
This worries me.

1745
02:46:48,572 --> 02:46:52,652
Now you're acting theatrical.

1746
02:46:52,951 --> 02:46:55,489
I know what I feel.

1747
02:46:55,787 --> 02:47:01,243
I love you in my selfish way

1748
02:47:01,542 --> 02:47:03,997
and I think you love me,

1749
02:47:04,295 --> 02:47:08,043
in your fussy, annoying way.

1750
02:47:08,340 --> 02:47:10,297
We love each other

1751
02:47:10,592 --> 02:47:13,510
like the people here on earth,

1752
02:47:13,803 --> 02:47:15,879
but you are so demanding.

1753
02:47:16,806 --> 02:47:18,715
Yes that's me.

1754
02:47:19,517 --> 02:47:21,758
It's that easy:

1755
02:47:22,060 --> 02:47:27,138
Here I am in a dark house somewhere in the world,

1756
02:47:27,608 --> 02:47:30,976
with my arms around you

1757
02:47:31,278 --> 02:47:35,227
and you are here in my arms.

1758
02:47:35,531 --> 02:47:39,992
I lack empathy for my fellow human beings.

1759
02:47:40,953 --> 02:47:44,868
I think I lack imagination.

1760
02:47:45,166 --> 02:47:50,076
I don't know what my love looks like and I can't describe it.

1761
02:47:50,378 --> 02:47:53,663
Most of the time I don't feel it.

1762
02:47:53,965 --> 02:47:57,879
Do you think I love you too?

1763
02:47:58,177 --> 02:48:00,253
Yes, I do.

1764
02:48:00,440 --> 02:48:04,225
If we keep dwelling on it, love will disappear.

1765
02:48:05,142 --> 02:48:08,059
Let's stay like this all night.

1766
02:48:09,021 --> 02:48:12,306
Oh, let's not...

1767
02:48:12,607 --> 02:48:16,901
One leg has fallen asleep, my left arm is dislocated,

1768
02:48:17,111 --> 02:48:20,278
I am tired and my back is cold.

1769
02:48:22,867 --> 02:48:25,986
Then let’s snuggle up.

1770
02:48:44,344 --> 02:48:49,006
Good night, my darling. It was nice talking to you.

1771
02:48:49,307 --> 02:48:53,554
- Sleep well. - You too.
