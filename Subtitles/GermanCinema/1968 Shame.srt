1
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:40,458
DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2015

2
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,180
SHAME

3
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:43,933
You know...

4
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,519
I had the strangest dream
last night.

5
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,605
Know what I dreamed?

6
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,692
We were back with the philharmonic,
sitting side by side,

7
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:56,070
rehearsing the fourth
Brandenburg Concerto, the largo.

8
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:01,367
And everything happening now
was behind us, like a bad dream.

9
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:05,705
I woke up crying.

10
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:08,917
I'd started crying
while we were playing.

11
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:11,669
It was the slow movement.

12
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:13,755
You know the one...

13
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:24,098
Aren't you going
to shave today either?

14
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,975
If you insist.

15
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:33,399
- Why are you in a bad mood?
- I'm not.

16
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,361
You're always
in a foul mood these days.

17
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:39,155
Go get dressed
or we'll miss the ferry.

18
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,200
We have to be
at the mayor's by 9:00.

19
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:47,080
That's hardly my fault.
I didn't start this damned war.

20
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,796
Listen...

21
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:58,758
maybe we could afford
a bottle of wine?

22
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:01,970
What do you say, Eva?

23
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,476
You're so silly.

24
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:11,938
Go get dressed.

25
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,607
I think I'm getting a wisdom tooth.

26
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:19,028
Is that dentist still around?
- We'll find out.

27
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:21,823
Wisdom teeth can be nasty.

28
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:24,492
I had one up here on the right.

29
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:27,328
The dentist had to extract it
piece by piece.

30
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:29,330
Took a whole day.

31
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,499
No anesthetic either.

32
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,502
I had a fever
for weeks afterwards.

33
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,882
I hope this one isn't as bad.
That would be nice.

34
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:42,301
Can you see anything?

35
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,431
No, not a thing.

36
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,183
Feel here. It feels swollen.

37
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,185
And there's a lump.

38
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:01,446
I guess we'd better hurry.

39
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,742
Did you pay the phone bill?

40
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,660
Shit! I forgot.

41
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:12,290
But why pay for something
that never works anyway?

42
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:15,209
They'd better fix the darn thing...

43
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:19,047
or I shouldn't have to pay.

44
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,592
- We have to have a phone.
- Of course.

45
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,678
But we don't get a lot of orders.

46
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:29,265
With no phone
we might as well pack it all in.

47
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,227
People could call the Olssons,
and we could pay them.

48
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:40,109
You hear the church bells?

49
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:43,154
Is it a holiday?

50
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:45,782
No, just an ordinary Friday.

51
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,369
What could it mean?
- Nothing. Hurry up, now.

52
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:53,831
It's ominous hearing church bells
on an ordinary day.

53
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,210
What time is it?
- Five past 6:00.

54
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:59,522
I think it's going to rain.
Go get your leather jacket.

55
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:39,145
Oh, for God's sake!

56
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,693
Jan?

57
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,743
What is it now?

58
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,540
You mustn't be so sensitive.

59
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,542
I can't take it.

60
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,881
Try to control yourself. I do.

61
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,885
Can't you ever shut up?

62
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:20,895
I'm sorry.

63
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,941
I forgot my jacket after all.

64
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:43,209
There sure have been
a lot of transports lately.

65
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:47,672
I didn't mean to be nasty.
It just happened.

66
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:50,591
Don't worry.
I give as good as I get.

67
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,901
You know what?

68
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:14,573
Tomorrow it will be four years
since we moved to this island.

69
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,077
And Grandpa died
a year ago yesterday.

70
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:21,706
We mustn't forget
to go put flowers on his grave.

71
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,473
Hi there, Filip!

72
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,864
What were you talking about?

73
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:40,242
He said the radio warned
of an impending invasion.

74
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:42,953
They've been saying that
for years.

75
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,041
- Our radio's always acting up!
- Not to mention the car.

76
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,961
If you didn't insist
on fixing things yourself...

77
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,260
It's better not to know anything.

78
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:00,888
God, your escapism drives me mad!

79
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,893
But I wasn't going to nag.

80
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:12,066
I got us some fish for dinner.
- That's good.

81
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,491
As you stood talking to Filip,
I felt really in love with you.

82
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,576
You looked so beautiful.

83
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,495
From a distance, right?

84
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,142
Good morning.

85
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:31,479
We were just coming to see you!

86
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:33,397
Really? Nice to see you.

87
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,941
We have some berries for you.

88
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,193
Morning.

89
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:41,322
We have lingonberries for you.
- Hello, Mrs. Rosenberg.

90
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:46,160
We just went out to check
on the summer cottage.

91
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:50,831
I was just telling the mayor we have
delicious lingonberries for you.

92
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:54,710
I'm afraid we're not
headed home just now —

93
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:59,048
- We'll drop them at your place.
- Sure it's no bother?

94
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,925
No bother at all.

95
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,345
- Is anyone at home?
- Miss Almberg should be there.

96
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:09,350
Why don't we get together for dinner
and make some music together

97
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:11,810
like in the old days?

98
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,522
I've missed our soirees.

99
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:16,524
We both have.

100
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,028
Ever since our conductor,
Mr. Kreisler, was drafted.

101
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,531
Mayor, may I ask you something?

102
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:27,368
Are these troop movements
significant?

103
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:30,412
The situation has become
more critical lately.

104
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:32,957
You hear so much on the radio —

105
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:35,292
Our radio's always broken!

106
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,921
I think you have
to hope for the best.

107
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:42,633
You never know what's in store.

108
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:46,053
My sister was evacuated
to a transit camp,

109
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,806
and they're bombed almost daily.

110
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:52,226
I think we're almost there.
We better say good-bye.

111
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:57,398
It would be great to see you.
- Give us a call.

112
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:59,316
Good-bye.

113
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:03,404
Give our best to your son.
- Thank you. We will.

114
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,541
- Can we go in the main entrance?
- Of course.

115
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,461
They gave us an extra ten kronor!

116
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,630
Let's get some wine at Fredrik's.

117
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,809
I guess he's out.

118
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,894
He never goes out.

119
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:02,064
Hi!

120
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,525
Have you been drafted too?

121
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:07,361
Yeah, just look at this getup.

122
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:11,240
And I haven't handled
a weapon in over 20 years.

123
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:13,409
Have a seat.

124
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,995
And I have no one
to look after the shop either.

125
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:19,456
Not that it makes
much difference.

126
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:22,960
How can I help you?
- We'd like a bottle of wine.

127
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:26,046
I have a few bottles left.

128
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,966
Listen, I want
to show you something.

129
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,722
You have to see this.

130
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,311
- Look at that!
- The finest piece I own.

131
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,733
- An antique, right?
- Meissen, 18th century.

132
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:50,320
- Where did you get it?
- My mother left it to me.

133
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,656
I'll never sell it.

134
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,743
Listen to that.

135
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,870
I'll be right back.

136
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,828
- Do you listen to the radio?
- No, ours never works.

137
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,790
I can't seem to fix it.

138
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,335
Yesterday our side
threatened to take

139
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,837
the most atrocious measures.

140
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:51,757
And today
the other side congratulated us

141
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:54,134
on our imminent destruction.

142
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,512
We've heard it all before.

143
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,348
I suspect we needn't
take it too seriously.

144
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,642
Wait a minute!

145
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,812
Taste this. It's quite good.

146
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:08,273
But we came to buy a bottle.

147
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,984
It's not bad at all.

148
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:13,821
Cheers.

149
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,248
- That's delicious.
- It really is.

150
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,458
May I have a look?

151
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,711
- I have just five bottles left.
- Look at that.

152
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,047
From 1959.

153
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,300
- Could we really afford a bottle?
- Sure.

154
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:39,012
Cheers.

155
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:53,318
You know, sometimes
when I sit here all alone

156
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,362
among my things...

157
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,948
I start feeling so miserable.

158
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:00,033
I'm not sure why.

159
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:04,454
Maybe because no one
would miss me if I were gone.

160
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,916
Not even Mrs. Prins.
- Mrs. Prins?

161
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,168
The lady who cleans for me.

162
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:14,256
Once a week she cleans the place
and makes coffee...

163
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:17,134
and we sleep together.

164
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:22,639
No, Mrs. Prins
won't particularly miss me.

165
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,560
You'll be back before you know it.

166
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:29,021
How much for a bottle?

167
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:33,567
For you, ten kronor.
I'd give it to you...

168
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,361
but I need the money.

169
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,072
To pay Mrs. Prins, in fact.

170
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:43,744
She's going to look
after my things while I'm gone.

171
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:50,959
Well, we have to catch the ferry.

172
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:55,923
You know, I have a bad foot.

173
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,800
You think they'll take that
into account

174
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:02,054
and give me
an administrative job?

175
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,056
Of course they will.

176
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:07,434
They didn't want me at all!
- Enough about you.

177
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,686
You have to show good faith

178
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:13,148
and not hide behind
a doctor's certificate.

179
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:17,819
But you have to tell them.
Maybe they'll send you home.

180
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:20,572
Thanks so much.

181
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:23,325
- See you soon.
- I hope so.

182
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,079
Well, good-bye.

183
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,706
Thank you. Good-bye.

184
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:42,511
I think we should drink
to Filip and his fish.

185
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:47,307
- And my cooking.
- And your cooking.

186
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:08,996
By the way,
the radio's working again.

187
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:12,082
- You fixed it?
- Yes, finally.

188
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,167
- Aren't you clever!
- I am, huh?

189
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,337
- When you want to be.
- I'm always clever.

190
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:20,966
Know what I'm going to do?
I'm pretty clever too.

191
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,843
I know you are.

192
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,304
- Take up Italian again.
- Finally!

193
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,141
- Starting tonight.
- You've talked about it for ages.

194
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,143
But I need your help.

195
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:34,312
You have to tell me
every night to study.

196
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:38,442
I'll time you and quiz you,
and I'll be very strict.

197
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,528
You know what else
we should do every morning?

198
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:45,657
Right after feeding the chickens,
we should practice our instruments.

199
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,869
You, that early?
This I'll have to see!

200
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:52,539
I swear I will!
A half hour every day.

201
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:56,001
We have our instruments
and tons of sheet music.

202
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:58,253
We have to keep up our skills.

203
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,380
Jan, I want children.

204
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:04,051
I really want to have children.
- Right now?

205
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,180
- No, not quite yet.
- Why?

206
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,433
It's not something
one can explain.

207
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,143
Try.

208
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:16,688
It's this feeling that —

209
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,858
Let's wait until things calm down.

210
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:22,235
No, I think this is important.

211
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:25,280
A lot of the problems
between us

212
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:28,075
might be because
we don't have kids.

213
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,369
Me being a woman
and not having kids.

214
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,998
I'd like to have kids before I'm 30.

215
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:37,793
You can wait till 40.

216
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:40,253
No, the younger, the better.

217
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,216
By 40 I want three kids.
We'll be a family.

218
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:47,969
Listen, this is serious,
what I have to say.

219
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:52,140
You mustn't get upset.
- I won't.

220
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,811
The next time we go into town,

221
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:59,106
I want us to go to a doctor...

222
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:00,774
Why?

223
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:05,320
...and get a checkup,
since I never seem to get pregnant.

224
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,572
I'm perfectly healthy.

225
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,575
So am I. We both are.

226
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:13,745
It's probably just your nerves.
- I mean it.

227
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,791
I want us to go
so you can get a checkup.

228
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,460
Don't take it personally.

229
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:24,422
That time we separated
for a while...

230
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,634
you were up to all sorts of stuff.

231
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,344
I didn't do anything.

232
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,722
That could be
why we don't get pregnant.

233
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:35,267
Because you had
lots of other women.

234
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:38,478
I did not.
Why bring that up?

235
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:42,190
It meant nothing.
You're the one I've always loved.

236
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:45,610
- What about that opera singer?
- She meant nothing.

237
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:49,406
It was just that one time.
I've always loved you.

238
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:53,160
I've always loved you.
I love you right now.

239
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:56,788
I'm not sure
you know what love is.

240
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,540
I certainly do.

241
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:03,086
Self-love.
You know a lot about that.

242
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,881
I'm not as selfish as you think.

243
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,216
I think you're very selfish.

244
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,595
I'll be a better man next year.
Next week!

245
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,347
- Is that right?
- I promise.

246
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:18,351
I believe one can change
completely if one wants to.

247
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,021
- You?
- Yes.

248
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:23,690
I'm not a determinist, you know.

249
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,943
- A what?
- A determinist.

250
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:29,404
What's a determinist?

251
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,576
A determinist is a person who —

252
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:41,583
Never mind.
Just so you fix the sink tomorrow.

253
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:46,254
Let's not do the dishes now.

254
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:50,258
No? What should we do instead?

255
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:23,310
- Where are you going?
- He'll die hanging up there!

256
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:25,854
- It could be the enemy.
- You coward!

257
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:29,149
- Stay here. You're not going.
- He's caught in the trees!

258
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:31,151
You're not going —

259
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,696
Then go!

260
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,851
I'll go call an ambulance!

261
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:33,213
- Did one or two men bail out?
- We only saw one. Right?

262
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:36,383
- Did you shoot the pilot?
- Was I supposed to?

263
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,636
No, I guess it wasn't you.

264
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:41,930
I suggest you clear out.

265
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:45,558
They dropped paratroopers
just half a mile from here.

266
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:20,135
I know what we'll do.

267
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,722
I'll put it in gear, and you push.
It's downhill anyway.

268
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:26,641
What are you doing?

269
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:37,193
Hurry up! Come on!

270
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,029
- You shot the pilot, didn't you?
- No, I didn't!

271
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:25,158
Lying will only make it worse.

272
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:27,660
He was dying when we got there.

273
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:30,830
Isn't that right?
- Yes!

274
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:33,082
Have other soldiers been here?

275
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,085
Yes, about 30 minutes ago.

276
00:30:36,294 --> 00:30:39,005
They warned us
that you'd landed nearby.

277
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:42,550
They were in two jeeps,
about 14 of them.

278
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:46,596
They told us to clear out
and headed for the shore.

279
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:48,681
Just calm down.

280
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:51,643
Breathe! Don't be afraid.

281
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:55,355
Is that mic and camera ready?
Come on.

282
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,317
We'll just chat a bit
for the folks at home.

283
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:01,736
Why are you resisting?

284
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:07,367
We want to show the folks
what sort of people we've liberated.

285
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,204
Camera.

286
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:16,417
"Voices of the Liberation 78."
Hand me the mic.

287
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:19,546
Your name?

288
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,508
Speak up. Don't be afraid.

289
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:25,718
Eva Rosenberg.

290
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,887
Tell us about yourself.

291
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:31,224
I'm 28.

292
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:37,063
I'm first violinist
in the philharmonic.

293
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:40,692
Jan and I have been married
for seven years.

294
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:44,571
We've lived here
since the orchestra was disbanded.

295
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,408
Tell us more.

296
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,451
There isn't any more.

297
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:54,622
What's your political affiliation?

298
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:58,585
- I don't have one.
- No political affiliation?

299
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,462
I don't really have the time,

300
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:04,090
and our radio's broken.

301
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:09,012
Don't you care
what political regime governs you?

302
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,139
It's not that.

303
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:16,144
It's just that the war has gone on
so long that it's hard to —

304
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,396
- So you're not indifferent?
- No!

305
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,607
- You've taken a stand?
- Yes.

306
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,900
Good. Excellent.

307
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:24,902
And your name?

308
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:28,281
I'm not feeling well.
I have a weak heart.

309
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:32,285
He isn't well.
Jan, wait a minute.

310
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:36,372
Keep rolling!
Get him passing out.

311
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:51,679
Come on.

312
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:55,975
Quick, Jan.

313
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,311
Let's get inside.

314
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,607
Help me out here.

315
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:06,819
Please help me, Jan.

316
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:59,414
You know what I was thinking
the whole time?

317
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:00,873
No.

318
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,376
It's good we don't have kids.

319
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,925
We'll have kids when peace comes.

320
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,554
We'll never have kids.

321
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:44,625
Jan, grab your boots and let's go!

322
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,753
We have to hurry.

323
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:48,921
Come on!

324
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:09,650
- We'll head for the shore.
- Fine. As long as you drive.

325
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:12,069
Hurry!

326
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:15,239
- What about food?
- I didn't have time to cook!

327
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:18,201
Let's take the chickens.

328
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:21,245
- Who's going to wring their necks?
- Not me!

329
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,789
We'll shoot them.

330
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,832
You ever hear
of shooting chickens?

331
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:28,044
- I refuse to wring their necks.
- Fine, shoot them!

332
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:30,546
Do whatever you want.

333
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:37,178
Not me!

334
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:41,974
It's still standing there.

335
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,811
Shoot the damned thing!
- I can't do it.

336
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:47,146
I'm so sick of you!

337
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:40,884
Eva, come!

338
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:17,171
We have to head back!

339
00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:20,466
Jan, drive us home!

340
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:25,262
Pull yourself together!

341
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:24,196
It sounds like —

342
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,868
It's sounds like
they're at the crossroads.

343
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:37,710
This god-awful noise!
I can't stand it!

344
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,046
I can't take it anymore!

345
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:10,242
Maybe we'd be safer
in the basement.

346
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:12,912
I won't be trapped like a rat!

347
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:51,570
Did I ever tell you about Pampini?

348
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:53,113
No.

349
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,575
He was a contemporary
of Beethoven's.

350
00:42:56,867 --> 00:42:58,994
He made instruments in Vienna.

351
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,247
Trained in the Italian school.

352
00:43:03,207 --> 00:43:07,378
He served in the Russian army
and fought Napoleon for many years.

353
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:11,632
Then he lost a leg
and went back to making violins.

354
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:15,052
This one was made in 1814,

355
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:17,429
same year
as the Congress of Vienna.

356
00:43:18,097 --> 00:43:20,224
He died of cholera.

357
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:22,184
I forget what year.

358
00:43:32,403 --> 00:43:34,446
My hand is ruined.

359
00:43:36,115 --> 00:43:37,908
You want to try?

360
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:58,012
Do you care for me a little?

361
00:43:59,305 --> 00:44:03,309
Yes, I care for you a little.

362
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:07,646
Do you love me?

363
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:14,320
Do you?

364
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,781
Sure, I love you.

365
00:44:22,036 --> 00:44:23,662
What is it?

366
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:27,374
What's wrong?
- I got a cramp.

367
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:35,299
There.

368
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:38,969
It's letting up.

369
00:44:44,141 --> 00:44:45,642
Hang on.

370
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:03,577
Jan.

371
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:06,455
Get over here.

372
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:15,065
Stop right there.

373
00:46:16,024 --> 00:46:19,111
- I have to close up the store.
- Hurry up!

374
00:46:21,321 --> 00:46:23,240
I'm Filip Olsson.

375
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:47,616
Take them inside.

376
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:49,243
Move it!

377
00:47:53,622 --> 00:47:55,541
Everyone inside!

378
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:10,472
Sit them down over there.

379
00:48:24,778 --> 00:48:27,197
Would you like to sit together?

380
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:36,123
- My name's Oswald.
- Rosenberg.

381
00:48:36,248 --> 00:48:40,419
We've met, actually.
The charity concert a few years back.

382
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:42,421
Of course.

383
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:45,340
I'm a teacher... or I was.

384
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:49,261
It doesn't look good.

385
00:49:01,815 --> 00:49:03,442
You know...

386
00:49:04,276 --> 00:49:06,945
sometimes this is all like a dream.

387
00:49:07,279 --> 00:49:08,905
Not my own.

388
00:49:09,031 --> 00:49:12,159
Someone else's dream
that I'm forced to be in.

389
00:49:12,284 --> 00:49:16,204
What happens when they wake up
and feel ashamed about all this?

390
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,957
Jan and Eva Rosenberg.

391
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:40,979
I see.

392
00:49:53,492 --> 00:49:56,286
We have reason to believe
you've collaborated

393
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:58,455
with the other side.

394
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,125
The most serious evidence
is Mrs. Rosenberg's TV interview

395
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,254
in which she endorses
the political views of the enemy.

396
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,341
- That's not true.
- Not true?

397
00:50:09,633 --> 00:50:12,678
We happen to have
a copy of the interview.

398
00:50:12,803 --> 00:50:14,846
Would you care to see it?

399
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:17,140
Lights out.

400
00:50:19,184 --> 00:50:22,479
<i>We've been oppressed
for far too long.</i>

401
00:50:23,188 --> 00:50:27,025
<i>We've longed for liberation
like those thirsting in the desert.</i>

402
00:50:27,526 --> 00:50:30,112
<i>I wish your troops victory.</i>

403
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:35,033
That wasn't my voice!
I never said that.

404
00:50:36,535 --> 00:50:38,412
Tell the truth now,

405
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:40,997
or you and your husband will pay!

406
00:50:41,415 --> 00:50:43,458
We never collaborated.

407
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:48,505
How do you explain the fact
that paratroopers liquidated

408
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:51,633
every civilian
within almost two square miles

409
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:54,428
yet spared the two of you?

410
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:56,346
I don't know.

411
00:50:56,555 --> 00:50:58,724
I don't understand any of this.

412
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,395
Take her out.
I want to speak to him alone.

413
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:10,569
No! Let me go!

414
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:39,890
Hello again, Mrs. Rosenberg.

415
00:51:50,484 --> 00:51:52,277
Sit down.

416
00:51:52,402 --> 00:51:54,529
What did they do to you?

417
00:51:55,197 --> 00:51:57,449
Let me see.

418
00:52:00,285 --> 00:52:02,829
Doctor, please.

419
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:10,086
Can you stand up?

420
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:16,843
Nothing wrong with you.
Your limbs are intact.

421
00:52:22,766 --> 00:52:25,268
You look dreadful. Stand up.

422
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:32,609
He'll have to go to the hospital.

423
00:52:39,908 --> 00:52:43,161
What about you?
How are you doing?

424
00:52:44,663 --> 00:52:46,748
Your shoulder's been dislocated.

425
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:50,377
Give me a hand.
We'll pop it back in place.

426
00:52:51,044 --> 00:52:53,004
No, don't!

427
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:07,269
No tennis for a few weeks.

428
00:53:10,939 --> 00:53:13,608
What do we have here?
Is he asleep?

429
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:17,863
Take him away.
He can't lie here rotting.

430
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:28,123
Have they fed you at all?
- No.

431
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:33,211
Sorry about that.
We're not yet properly organized.

432
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:35,714
I'll have them send in some food.

433
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:38,466
And the lady?
Is anything ailing her?

434
00:53:38,592 --> 00:53:40,719
Nothing? Good.

435
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:42,637
Cigarette?

436
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:46,016
Good evening.

437
00:53:48,894 --> 00:53:52,564
Was the man they carried out dead?
Who was that?

438
00:53:53,899 --> 00:53:56,902
- The editor of the local paper.
- Really?

439
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:03,199
A false rumor went around saying
the invasion had been a success.

440
00:54:04,743 --> 00:54:07,579
So they made up a front page
welcoming the liberation forces.

441
00:54:08,997 --> 00:54:12,375
- What about you, Vicar?
- They treated me humanely.

442
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,086
They let me go
once I started screaming.

443
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,547
Almost as if
they were embarrassed.

444
00:54:17,672 --> 00:54:20,508
Well, they certainly beat me!

445
00:54:20,634 --> 00:54:25,430
They hit me on the head.
- Where? I don't see anything.

446
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:27,849
The gray-haired guy said...

447
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:31,061
"This is for that TV segment."

448
00:54:32,145 --> 00:54:34,397
<i>How many are in here?</i>

449
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:38,026
Oh, there are three of you.

450
00:54:42,948 --> 00:54:45,116
I'll be back with one more.

451
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:09,516
- Need some help?
- No, I'm fine.

452
00:55:09,641 --> 00:55:11,476
I'll hold it.

453
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:15,605
- I'm just a bit stiff.
- I can imagine.

454
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:17,857
That's fine, thanks.

455
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,318
It looked painful.

456
00:55:21,695 --> 00:55:23,321
I'm fine.

457
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:25,407
Does it hurt?

458
00:55:25,615 --> 00:55:28,201
It's more of a throbbing now.

459
00:55:29,244 --> 00:55:31,162
Report to the courtyard!

460
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:31,181
Fall in!

461
00:56:32,724 --> 00:56:34,225
Order arms!

462
00:56:34,726 --> 00:56:36,394
Fall in!

463
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:38,229
Hurry up!

464
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,218
This man collaborated
with the enemy

465
00:57:08,343 --> 00:57:10,428
and caused us heavy losses.

466
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:13,598
But the government
has pardoned him

467
00:57:13,765 --> 00:57:17,519
and commuted his death sentence
to life at hard labor.

468
00:57:26,027 --> 00:57:30,907
The rest of you will also receive
more leniency than you deserve.

469
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:34,077
Some of you
will be freed immediately

470
00:57:34,202 --> 00:57:36,329
and transported home.

471
00:58:09,779 --> 00:58:11,990
Take these two to my office.

472
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:34,721
May we please sit down?

473
00:58:34,846 --> 00:58:36,055
Hell no.

474
00:58:36,181 --> 00:58:39,184
If Jacobi saw you,
he'd have my hide.

475
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:49,777
What will happen now?

476
00:59:07,754 --> 00:59:09,422
Come inside.

477
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,472
Have a seat.

478
00:59:18,056 --> 00:59:20,558
I heard about
the infamous interview.

479
00:59:20,725 --> 00:59:23,061
We knew it was a complete fake...

480
00:59:23,228 --> 00:59:27,899
but they needed someone
to make an example of.

481
00:59:28,024 --> 00:59:30,777
Are you all right?
No serious injuries?

482
00:59:31,236 --> 00:59:33,655
I gave orders not to touch you.

483
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:37,408
- They behaved... almost correctly.
- That's something at least.

484
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:46,376
I hope we'll meet again soon
and have a chance to talk.

485
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:49,671
Where the hell are those drivers?

486
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:52,465
I assume
you're anxious to get home.

487
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:57,428
Things better shape up
around here come Monday!

488
00:59:59,472 --> 01:00:02,809
I'm trying to get a car
to spare you the jeep.

489
01:00:02,934 --> 01:00:07,313
Jacobi here.
Please send a car here at once.

490
01:00:08,356 --> 01:00:11,985
Peters, make sure they get home
as quickly as possible.

491
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:14,445
Good-bye.

492
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:29,020
I'm sick of this.
You keep on if you want.

493
01:01:31,981 --> 01:01:33,983
Playing the martyr, huh?

494
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:37,320
All sanctimonious
and full of hate.

495
01:01:38,863 --> 01:01:41,866
It's funny.
As long as there was a war,

496
01:01:42,033 --> 01:01:44,410
we were relatively decent
to each other.

497
01:01:45,578 --> 01:01:47,830
I'm going in to hear the news.

498
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:51,042
You do that.
It'll be a relief not to see you.

499
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:54,712
Jacobi gave us that radio
and said it was important —

500
01:01:54,879 --> 01:01:58,549
Then go listen to the damn thing
if it's so important!

501
01:02:04,055 --> 01:02:05,765
Just the other day...

502
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:09,560
you said it was good
we had Jacobi as a friend.

503
01:02:09,685 --> 01:02:12,230
- I said no such thing.
- You did too.

504
01:02:12,397 --> 01:02:15,733
You were just too drunk
to remember it.

505
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:21,322
I'm going to ask Jacobi
to stop coming here.

506
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:24,409
Filip says it could
make things worse for us.

507
01:02:24,534 --> 01:02:28,079
It's none of Filip's damn business
who comes here!

508
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:31,124
- Well, you're such a suck-up!
- You should talk.

509
01:02:31,249 --> 01:02:32,834
I don't suck up.

510
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:35,253
You do too.
You're a suck-up.

511
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,089
Don't you dare call me that!

512
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:41,926
Suck-up, suck-up, suck-up!

513
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,141
When peace comes,
we're going our separate ways.

514
01:02:48,266 --> 01:02:52,603
It will be heaven to get away
from you and your childishness.

515
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:57,442
You're not the only one
whose life has been ruined.

516
01:02:57,608 --> 01:03:00,027
There are other people
in this world!

517
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,447
Stop grinning like that!

518
01:03:02,572 --> 01:03:05,074
You're not as remarkable
as you think!

519
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:19,380
I'm sorry.

520
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:24,635
You say that,
but you don't mean it.

521
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:27,805
The words just fall
out of your mouth.

522
01:03:31,017 --> 01:03:33,060
Can't we be friends?

523
01:03:44,489 --> 01:03:47,617
- What day of the week is it?
- I don't know.

524
01:03:47,742 --> 01:03:50,495
It's Saturday.
No, that was yesterday.

525
01:03:50,661 --> 01:03:52,580
Today must be Sunday.

526
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:55,666
What time is it?

527
01:03:59,003 --> 01:04:00,963
Must be that damned Jacobi.

528
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:16,354
Am I disturbing you?

529
01:04:17,313 --> 01:04:19,023
Not at all.

530
01:04:19,732 --> 01:04:22,652
I was on my way home
after a walk.

531
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,821
I thought I'd stop in,
if I'm not disturbing you.

532
01:04:25,947 --> 01:04:28,324
No, we're just listening
to the radio.

533
01:04:28,449 --> 01:04:30,117
My shoes are muddy.

534
01:04:30,243 --> 01:04:33,287
Might Jan have some slippers
I could borrow?

535
01:04:33,579 --> 01:04:37,583
These are soaking wet.
They should go by the fire.

536
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:39,627
Jan!

537
01:04:39,835 --> 01:04:43,381
Jan Rosenberg,
where the hell are you?

538
01:04:44,173 --> 01:04:48,052
I brought you a present, Jan,
a damn fine one:

539
01:04:48,553 --> 01:04:51,931
Dvorak's Trio in E-flat Major.

540
01:04:52,056 --> 01:04:56,227
An uncle left it to me.
- Thank you!

541
01:04:56,394 --> 01:04:59,313
Perhaps we'll play it
together one day.

542
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:01,941
I have something
for you too, Eva.

543
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:07,154
I hope it's the right size.
It's an old family heirloom.

544
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:10,908
You really mustn't give us so much!

545
01:05:20,418 --> 01:05:22,003
<i>Hello, Jan.</i>

546
01:05:22,461 --> 01:05:23,963
Eva...

547
01:05:25,089 --> 01:05:26,674
talk to me.

548
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:29,260
Say something.

549
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,889
My dear Eva, don't be sad.

550
01:05:34,557 --> 01:05:36,100
Who was that?

551
01:05:36,267 --> 01:05:39,312
A neighbor who gives us fish
now and then.

552
01:05:39,437 --> 01:05:42,773
But I got the feeling —
- He's just a good friend.

553
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,942
He needed some kerosene.

554
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:47,778
Thanks for that whole drum,
by the way.

555
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:50,990
Those men are driven
by a terrible idealism.

556
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:52,908
And you're not?

557
01:05:53,326 --> 01:05:55,620
Eva doesn't like me this evening.

558
01:05:55,745 --> 01:05:59,707
If I asked her for a kiss,
she'd claim it would bother you.

559
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:01,751
But it wouldn't, would it?

560
01:06:01,876 --> 01:06:03,836
You'll have to ask her.

561
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,384
How about a kiss?

562
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:20,811
You're so nice.

563
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:25,941
But you know you put us
in a difficult situation

564
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:28,152
by coming here so often?

565
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:31,656
I see.

566
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:35,660
You're telling me
you don't want me here.

567
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:39,205
Don't get Eva wrong.
All she meant was —

568
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:41,624
Too bad I happen
to like you two,

569
01:06:41,749 --> 01:06:44,377
that we became friends
in spite of everything.

570
01:06:44,502 --> 01:06:47,672
Otherwise I could have
sent you to a labor camp.

571
01:06:48,756 --> 01:06:52,176
Jan Rosenberg, are you afraid?
- No.

572
01:06:52,343 --> 01:06:56,138
- Are you an artist or a mouse?
- Oh, I'm a mouse —

573
01:07:03,145 --> 01:07:05,189
The sacred freedom of art.

574
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:07,692
The sacred gutlessness of art.

575
01:07:18,536 --> 01:07:20,663
I'm going out to take a piss.

576
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:32,299
God, I wish I could sober up!

577
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:35,136
That was too much.

578
01:07:37,847 --> 01:07:40,182
We have to get rid of him.

579
01:07:41,058 --> 01:07:43,394
That was
a nasty moment with Filip.

580
01:07:45,479 --> 01:07:48,816
Did you know
that the woods are full of people?

581
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:02,037
I've often wondered
what they'll do to me.

582
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:05,374
The thought frightens me, I admit.

583
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:11,213
They have no reason to torture me.
I have no secret information.

584
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:15,301
But perhaps they just feel
like making me suffer.

585
01:08:15,593 --> 01:08:17,928
Don't worry. I'm just kidding.

586
01:08:18,053 --> 01:08:20,639
This part of the island
has been pacified.

587
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:26,645
Eva...

588
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:28,898
touch me.

589
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,775
No.

590
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:32,485
Touch my head.

591
01:08:35,154 --> 01:08:36,614
There.

592
01:08:36,822 --> 01:08:39,033
Can you feel that I'm here?

593
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:41,285
Touch my eyes.

594
01:08:50,252 --> 01:08:51,712
Here.

595
01:08:52,171 --> 01:08:53,839
Put your hand here.

596
01:08:56,592 --> 01:08:58,844
Can you feel who I am?
- No.

597
01:08:59,762 --> 01:09:01,806
Jan, take my hands.

598
01:09:05,142 --> 01:09:07,645
You feel who I am?
- Of course, but —

599
01:09:07,812 --> 01:09:09,647
It's odd, you see.

600
01:09:10,022 --> 01:09:13,150
I've only felt close
to others a few times.

601
01:09:13,275 --> 01:09:15,277
Always in connection with pain.

602
01:09:15,945 --> 01:09:20,491
Is it the same for you two?
- No, it's not.

603
01:09:21,116 --> 01:09:23,661
It's not something
you can talk about.

604
01:09:24,161 --> 01:09:27,498
There's nothing to say,
nowhere to hide.

605
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:30,751
No excuses, no evasions.

606
01:09:32,044 --> 01:09:34,338
Just great guilt, great pain...

607
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:37,800
and great fear.

608
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:43,472
Damn, it's cold.
- I think it's time you go home.

609
01:09:46,642 --> 01:09:50,020
I feel the change in weather
in my bad leg.

610
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:54,316
Eva, come here.

611
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:57,319
I have something for you.

612
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:11,292
Here's 23,000 kronor.
I want you to have my life savings.

613
01:10:11,417 --> 01:10:14,545
- I don't want your money.
- Don't be silly.

614
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:17,715
We'll consider it an inheritance.

615
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:23,888
My dear Eva...

616
01:10:24,597 --> 01:10:26,599
can I talk to you?

617
01:10:30,311 --> 01:10:34,189
I was at my son's place
a few days ago.

618
01:10:35,024 --> 01:10:36,942
He's on leave...

619
01:10:37,902 --> 01:10:40,654
and he has
a little boy of 19 months.

620
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:43,240
It was the boy's bedtime,

621
01:10:43,616 --> 01:10:47,244
and his daddy was feeding him
pap from a big cup.

622
01:10:47,995 --> 01:10:50,748
There he sat,
like a baby monkey,

623
01:10:50,998 --> 01:10:53,876
cuddled up
in his father's great big body.

624
01:10:56,045 --> 01:10:59,131
By the time he was full,
he was practically asleep.

625
01:11:00,299 --> 01:11:01,800
Eva?

626
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:05,554
May I tell you something else?

627
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:11,894
My mother died a few years back.

628
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:15,022
She was old and had a bad heart.

629
01:11:15,314 --> 01:11:18,901
I got a call one Sunday
saying she was very ill...

630
01:11:19,026 --> 01:11:20,945
so I went to see her.

631
01:11:22,237 --> 01:11:25,449
When I entered the living room,
the doctor approached me.

632
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:29,495
I asked him,
"May I go in to see my mother?"

633
01:11:30,496 --> 01:11:32,122
He replied...

634
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:35,834
"Your mother just passed away."

635
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:42,633
I sat at her side for an hour,
looking at her.

636
01:11:46,095 --> 01:11:48,764
She had a bandage
on her index finger.

637
01:11:49,974 --> 01:11:52,893
At times I thought
I could hear her breathing.

638
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:04,238
There isn't much
that gets through.

639
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:08,909
You know why I took this job?

640
01:12:09,118 --> 01:12:10,619
No.

641
01:12:10,911 --> 01:12:12,830
I was given a choice...

642
01:12:13,831 --> 01:12:16,875
and I was afraid
of going to the front.

643
01:12:18,293 --> 01:12:20,838
Do you regret your decision?

644
01:12:21,005 --> 01:12:22,506
No.

645
01:12:23,674 --> 01:12:26,427
I've never been unfaithful
to Jan before.

646
01:12:28,846 --> 01:12:31,515
Sometimes it frightens me
to think about it...

647
01:12:31,682 --> 01:12:33,851
so I don't.

648
01:12:35,728 --> 01:12:37,813
No, not here.

649
01:12:38,147 --> 01:12:39,648
Come with me.

650
01:12:47,114 --> 01:12:48,699
He's asleep.

651
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,594
I'll get your cane.

652
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:55,362
Cry if you think it will help.

653
01:17:18,135 --> 01:17:20,470
Where did that money come from?

654
01:17:36,278 --> 01:17:38,447
The yard's full of people.

655
01:18:06,683 --> 01:18:08,977
We're going to have a talk.

656
01:18:13,065 --> 01:18:14,816
All right!

657
01:18:52,104 --> 01:18:53,897
Come in here a minute.

658
01:19:09,746 --> 01:19:12,541
We've talked things over.

659
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:15,794
Filip says I can buy my freedom

660
01:19:15,919 --> 01:19:19,089
because their organization
needs cash.

661
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:24,344
So I'm asking you, dear Eva:
Lend me the money I gave you.

662
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:27,222
Jan has it.

663
01:19:27,431 --> 01:19:29,933
I don't know anything
about any money.

664
01:19:34,146 --> 01:19:37,607
- You didn't take it?
- I don't know what you mean.

665
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,318
Tell your husband to hand it over.

666
01:19:40,444 --> 01:19:43,488
Go get the money if you hid it.

667
01:19:43,613 --> 01:19:45,699
It's not yours anyway.

668
01:19:46,366 --> 01:19:48,869
I don't know what you're talking about.

669
01:19:51,121 --> 01:19:52,873
We'll have to search the place.

670
01:21:13,787 --> 01:21:15,413
Where's the money?

671
01:21:15,539 --> 01:21:18,208
I don't know
what you're talking about!

672
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:43,066
Let's blow the joint sky-high!

673
01:21:50,574 --> 01:21:52,033
Well?

674
01:25:01,347 --> 01:25:04,267
- Where did you hide the money?
- I didn't.

675
01:25:05,018 --> 01:25:06,186
Where is it?

676
01:26:02,033 --> 01:26:04,786
Why didn't you hand over
the money?

677
01:26:04,994 --> 01:26:07,914
- They'd have shot him anyway.
- That's not true.

678
01:26:10,959 --> 01:26:12,961
Stop it.

679
01:26:16,297 --> 01:26:17,507
Stop it!

680
01:27:04,971 --> 01:27:08,683
Don't shoot. We're not armed.

681
01:27:10,393 --> 01:27:12,186
Are you hungry?

682
01:27:13,229 --> 01:27:15,315
We'll feed you.

683
01:27:17,233 --> 01:27:18,735
Wait.

684
01:27:31,998 --> 01:27:33,750
Did you desert?

685
01:27:37,337 --> 01:27:39,422
Did you hurt your hand?

686
01:27:39,756 --> 01:27:41,549
A dog bit me.

687
01:27:41,925 --> 01:27:43,968
Shall I have a look?

688
01:27:49,933 --> 01:27:52,727
Come sit down. I'll bandage it up.

689
01:27:58,149 --> 01:28:00,818
Hang on.
I'll get you something to eat.

690
01:28:02,236 --> 01:28:03,821
Want some?

691
01:28:04,697 --> 01:28:06,783
Aren't you hungry?

692
01:28:17,752 --> 01:28:20,213
- What's your name?
- Johan.

693
01:28:22,757 --> 01:28:25,927
- Have you been hiding out long?
- A few weeks.

694
01:28:27,637 --> 01:28:30,640
- You have a bandage on you?
- In my pocket.

695
01:28:30,765 --> 01:28:32,433
I'll get it.

696
01:28:36,437 --> 01:28:38,147
Is Hammars far from here?

697
01:28:39,232 --> 01:28:42,610
- What will you do there?
- None of your business.

698
01:28:43,861 --> 01:28:45,697
Are you tired?

699
01:28:45,822 --> 01:28:47,824
Want to get some sleep?

700
01:28:50,076 --> 01:28:51,995
Why did you run away?

701
01:28:52,787 --> 01:28:54,998
A bunch of us ran off together.

702
01:28:55,581 --> 01:28:58,167
I don't know
where the others went.

703
01:29:01,713 --> 01:29:03,673
Have something to drink.

704
01:29:15,101 --> 01:29:17,228
I haven't slept in days.

705
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:27,822
Tell us why
you're going to Hammars.

706
01:29:57,894 --> 01:29:59,437
Leave him alone.

707
01:29:59,562 --> 01:30:01,981
Let him sleep.

708
01:30:06,778 --> 01:30:08,905
No, leave me alone!

709
01:30:09,072 --> 01:30:10,907
Get up!

710
01:30:15,161 --> 01:30:16,662
Get up!

711
01:30:16,871 --> 01:30:18,498
Leave me alone.

712
01:30:22,251 --> 01:30:23,711
Get up!

713
01:30:25,922 --> 01:30:28,674
Leave me alone!
Just let me go!

714
01:30:28,966 --> 01:30:30,843
Don't shoot!

715
01:30:32,345 --> 01:30:35,932
Just let me go!
You can have my shoes!

716
01:31:58,514 --> 01:32:00,349
What did you do with him?

717
01:32:02,852 --> 01:32:06,522
There's a fishing boat leaving
from Hammars tomorrow.

718
01:32:07,023 --> 01:32:11,319
A friend who'd paid to be on it
told him about it.

719
01:32:12,528 --> 01:32:15,114
That friend was shot
that same day.

720
01:32:16,115 --> 01:32:17,992
What did you do to him?

721
01:32:18,117 --> 01:32:21,704
These shoes will come in handy.
Mine are worn out.

722
01:32:24,874 --> 01:32:28,878
What did you do to him?

723
01:32:50,233 --> 01:32:52,068
I'm not going with you.

724
01:32:52,235 --> 01:32:54,028
Easier that way.

725
01:33:06,332 --> 01:33:09,418
Maybe we should bring some food.

726
01:33:54,505 --> 01:33:56,215
Jan?

727
01:34:03,848 --> 01:34:07,727
What will happen if we can never
talk to one another again?

728
01:34:08,769 --> 01:34:11,105
The boat's here.

729
01:34:47,725 --> 01:34:50,061
Is there room for me and Eva?

730
01:34:50,353 --> 01:34:52,063
It'll cost you.

731
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:54,398
Will this do?

732
01:41:47,269 --> 01:41:49,271
I had a dream.

733
01:41:51,607 --> 01:41:54,610
I was walking
down a very beautiful street.

734
01:41:56,904 --> 01:42:00,991
On one side were white houses

735
01:42:01,116 --> 01:42:03,786
with towering arches and pillars.

736
01:42:05,496 --> 01:42:10,209
On the other side was a leafy park.

737
01:42:14,505 --> 01:42:19,510
Dark green water flowed
beneath the trees lining the street.

738
01:42:23,263 --> 01:42:25,724
I came to a high wall...

739
01:42:26,558 --> 01:42:29,269
overgrown with roses.

740
01:42:33,941 --> 01:42:37,820
Then an airplane came
and set the roses on fire.

741
01:42:39,822 --> 01:42:44,493
But it wasn't all that terrible,
because it was so beautiful.

742
01:42:46,453 --> 01:42:48,956
I looked down into the water

743
01:42:49,414 --> 01:42:52,000
and watched the roses burn.

744
01:42:55,128 --> 01:42:57,923
I held a baby in my arms.

745
01:42:58,465 --> 01:43:00,384
It was our daughter.

746
01:43:03,595 --> 01:43:06,014
She snuggled up to me...

747
01:43:07,474 --> 01:43:11,061
and I could feel her mouth...

748
01:43:12,062 --> 01:43:14,690
against my cheek.

749
01:43:17,276 --> 01:43:19,528
And the whole time I knew

750
01:43:19,903 --> 01:43:22,656
there was something
I should remember...

751
01:43:24,533 --> 01:43:26,910
something someone had said.

752
01:43:29,329 --> 01:43:31,874
But I'd forgotten what it was...
