00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,590
Ficus Religiosa
is a tree with an unusual life cycle.

4
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,690
Its seeds, contained in bird
droppings, fall on other trees.

5
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,620
Aerial roots spring up
and grow down to the floor.

6
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,580
Then, the branches wrap around
the host tree and strangle it.

7
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,510
Finally, the sacred fig
stands on its own.

8
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:24,730
THE SEED OF THE SACRED FIG

9
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,520
Thank you so much,

10
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,660
I was going to bed.

11
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,600
You haven't eaten since yesterday.
Have your breakfast first.

12
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,600
Your prayer was finally answered.

13
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,710
I'm so proud of you.

14
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,560
I wish your father could see this.

15
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,630
May he rest in peace.

16
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,680
Iman...

17
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,610
Will we be given
a three-bedroom apartment?

18
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,700
- It'll be a while.
- We'll wait.

19
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,510
The girls are too big
to share their bedroom.

20
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,580
It's going to change our lives
to move.

21
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,550
I was given this for self-defense.

22
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,620
Why?

23
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,630
To protect us.

24
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,550
Try it.

25
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,690
Hold it.

26
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,540
No, I don't like it.

27
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,640
Don't be scared, the safety is on.

28
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,640
I'm not scared.

29
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,620
It's heavy.

30
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,650
Shall we tell the girls?

31
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,540
Not yet.

32
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,610
But it's the perfect moment.

33
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,530
They'll be so proud to find out
their father has become a judge.

34
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,550
Not a judge, an investigator.

35
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,650
It doesn't matter.

36
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,680
You'll be a judge soon.

37
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,570
We'll see.

38
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,600
It's important for them
to know these things.

39
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,590
It will build their character.

40
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,640
You know about
the revolutionary courts.

41
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,650
They're unpopular.

42
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,560
Yes, but it's been too long.

43
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,570
You were waiting for an opportunity
to tell them about your work.

44
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,570
This is the best one.

45
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,620
We can go to a restaurant

46
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,610
to celebrate your promotion.

47
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,500
And we'll both talk to the girls.

48
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,640
I'm not sure.

49
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,650
Let me take care of this.

50
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,520
- OK?
- OK.

51
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,530
Sana, quiet, Dad's sleeping.

52
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,510
It's no big deal if I'm not there.

53
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,580
Impossible.

54
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,540
It's important.
The four of us need to talk about it.

55
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,670
So tell us now.

56
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,660
I'm telling you
your father has to be present.

57
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,510
It's both
a celebration and a meeting.

58
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,720
- What celebration?
- You'll see.

59
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,580
Please don't ruin my gathering.

60
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,630
See your friends another day.

61
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,550
Another day? It's her birthday.

62
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,660
Then ask her to be born another day!

63
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,700
Seriously.

64
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,650
I can't postpone it,
we've been planning it for a while.

65
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,670
Family must be your priority.

66
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,640
What's this meeting-celebration
anyway?

67
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,600
For the 20 years I've known your dad,
he's been dreaming of this.

68
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,620
Stop the suspense!
Tell us what's happened.

69
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,680
What if I told you
you'll each have your own bedroom?

70
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,730
No kidding? Seriously?

71
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,570
Hush, I said.

72
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,710
Let's run to the restaurant.

73
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,530
Bye!

74
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,510
Thank you very much.

75
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,630
A judge cannot rule

76
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,600
without first gathering
information and evidence.

77
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,580
Your job was
to gather that information?

78
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,690
Yes.

79
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,530
And why couldn't we know that?
You could have told us sooner.

80
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,510
They must stay anonymous

81
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,630
for their own safety
and that of their families.

82
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,560
In each case,
there's a winner and a loser.

83
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,630
The loser can always consider
he's been convicted unjustly

84
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,620
and seek revenge.

85
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,620
Now you're an investigating judge,
it's still dangerous.

86
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,530
That's right, honey.

87
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,610
But now you're big enough

88
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,520
to understand his position
and be careful.

89
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,720
Careful about what?

90
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,590
You mean, to take revenge on him,
they might hurt us?

91
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,610
It's possible.

92
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,720
But we're going to move to a place
where the neighbors are like us.

93
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,630
And they have kids.

94
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,550
We'll be safe,

95
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,510
the neighborhood is watched.

96
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,620
You should respect certain things

97
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,620
so as not to harm your father.

98
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,640
Like what?

99
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,540
Like the hijab.

100
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,630
No photos of you on social media.

101
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,590
You must be irreproachable.

102
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,680
Anything you do
would be immediately denounced.

103
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,560
You must watch your attitude,
your clothes, the places you go to,

104
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,540
your friends, your words.

105
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,560
Can you do your spoon trick?

106
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,610
Sure.

107
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,500
What's this?

108
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,610
It's written on it.

109
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,710
A five-volume case file.

110
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,580
It takes time to investigate.

111
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,570
I haven't even started.

112
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,530
Don't bother, write down
the indictment and sign.

113
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,590
It's the prosecutor's order.

114
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,730
I can't.

115
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,680
I've been working honorably
for 20 years.

116
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,710
I took an oath.

117
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,520
WIRETAPPED.

118
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,680
I suggest you read the text
of the judges' oath again.

119
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,500
Especially the last part.

120
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,700
Lunchtime.

121
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,540
Why do you think
you became an investigator?

122
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,550
The boss doesn't like you.

123
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,520
He was against your promotion.

124
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,600
He wanted to have one of his guys.

125
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,700
I was the one who insisted.

126
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,700
He's watching for
the slightest misstep on your part.

127
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,640
Do you want me to be challenged?

128
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,620
Or compromise your own success
and your family's serenity?

129
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,500
Do you know how many people
wanted this position?

130
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,710
Iman...

131
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,550
Here, you have to fight,

132
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,610
you have to earn your stripes.

133
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,570
Especially on a case
with an order from the prosecutor.

134
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,560
I haven't even read the file.

135
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,700
How can I indict him
of offense against God

136
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,710
and ask for a death sentence?

137
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,660
How's that?

138
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,650
It's great.

139
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,510
The shoulders fit badly.

140
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,720
And it's loose in the front.

141
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,660
- Shall I tell her?
- Sure.

142
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,730
- Madam...
- Yes?

143
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,530
Thank you, it's very nice,

144
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,660
but the shoulders fit badly.

145
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,680
And the front is loose,

146
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,500
it hides her chest.

147
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,660
One, this isn't the chest,
it's boobs.

148
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,660
Two, her shoulders
will be hidden by the veil.

149
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,660
It's true
but can you please fix this?

150
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,530
Young lady,

151
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,700
this is a uniform,
not an evening gown.

152
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,710
Why wouldn't a uniform look good?

153
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,630
OK, take if off.

154
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,620
Can you also tighten the front?

155
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,690
OK, but if they bug her at school,
don't complain to me.

156
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,660
Sadaf, forget it.

157
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,650
No! I hate loose clothes.

158
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,530
OK, then, please tighten it a bit.

159
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,640
OK, I'll see to it.

160
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,610
When will it be ready?

161
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,670
Call me next week.

162
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,730
School is starting next week!

163
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,520
What can I do? I'm busy.

164
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,540
Hello?

165
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,620
Hi, Mom.

166
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,580
Isn't it hard to be away?

167
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,530
It's a bit hard
to be in a college dorm,

168
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,690
but at the same time, it's cool.

169
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,510
You make new friends,
meet all kinds of people.

170
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,560
You become more independent.

171
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,510
Your mom's brave to let you go.

172
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,580
That was delicious.

173
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,530
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.

174
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,730
- You had enough?
- Yes.

175
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,700
At the beginning,

176
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,680
my mom was a bit worried

177
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,700
but now that I'm settled, she's OK.

178
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,730
- How many are you in a dorm?
- Eight.

179
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,550
So cool, I wanna go there too.

180
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,730
Then Amir called and a red heart
appeared on the screen.

181
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,640
I added it to his contact.

182
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,680
My mom said: who's that?

183
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,660
I said: a classmate.

184
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,560
She said: do you put red hearts
for all your classmates?

185
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,510
I didn't know what to say.

186
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,680
And then, she said:
let me see what he's like.

187
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,600
I said...

188
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,540
She wanted to see him?
She's so laid-back.

189
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,700
- Rezvan?
- Yes?

190
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,640
- Come here.
- OK.

191
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,580
- I'll be right back.
- OK.

192
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,500
Sana, go help.

193
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,610
You should have put a white heart,
she wouldn't have suspected you.

194
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,670
Yes, Mom?

195
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,570
Your friend had lunch,

196
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,700
serve her tea and off she goes.

197
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,510
What do you mean?

198
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,700
I told you about her situation.

199
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,520
The dorm is not ready.
She knows nobody in Tehran.

200
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,570
You want to kick her out?

201
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,710
If she didn't know you,
what would she do?

202
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,590
She knows me.

203
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,550
This is what I meant.

204
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,580
Our life has changed,
we have to be very careful.

205
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,670
About what?

206
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,570
Our entourage.

207
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,610
What danger would Sadaf
represent for us?

208
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,630
Why do you think
my problem is Sadaf?

209
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,700
I'm telling you
we have to change our lifestyle.

210
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,700
If it's hard for you to tell her,
I'll talk to her.

211
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,660
I'll talk to Dad.

212
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,660
I'll ask him to let Sadaf stay.

213
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,540
Your father doesn't even know
who she is.

214
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,530
He's very busy, don't disturb him.

215
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,660
He's left all this up to me.

216
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,520
Let her spend the afternoon here.

217
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,680
I'll tell her in the meantime
that she has to leave.

218
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,610
OK?

219
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,590
OK, if it's just for the afternoon.

220
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,730
- Rezvan...
- Yes?

221
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,580
Why is it so important to you?

222
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,510
She's my friend, I promised her.

223
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,720
She's very lonely here.

224
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,610
What if you put her up tonight

225
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,640
and then again,
her dorm is not ready?

226
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,600
It will be ready tomorrow.

227
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,520
It's planned, I promise you.

228
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,620
I really didn't think you'd mind
having her one night.

229
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,690
That's why I offered.

230
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,500
She can stay on two conditions.

231
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,680
Which ones?

232
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,610
First, never ask me
this kind of favor again.

233
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,630
Second, make sure

234
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,640
between the time Dad comes home
tonight and when he leaves tomorrow,

235
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,720
Sadaf doesn't come out
of the bedroom.

236
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,610
I can't lock her in!

237
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,640
She can't see your father.

238
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,710
OK.

239
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,600
Mom, my eyebrows are still too thick.

240
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,550
Can you make the end thinner?

241
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,680
So you look like a slut?

242
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,670
I have thin eyebrows

243
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,690
but I'm a good girl!

244
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,580
I'm sorry,
that's not what I meant!

245
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,630
Rezvan has to respect
her family's rules.

246
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,650
When she gets married,

247
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,600
she'll see with her husband.

248
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,650
Sure, she'll respect his rules.

249
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,570
- When will I live for myself?
- Don't move.

250
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,570
Mind you,
natural eyebrows are fashionable.

251
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,650
Are you really plucking them?

252
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,550
I can't feel anything.

253
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,550
Of course I'm plucking them.

254
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,730
Did you see the photo I sent you?

255
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,730
Yeah, it was beautiful.

256
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,650
Mom, can I get some highlights soon?

257
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,610
What's next?
With this beautiful hair you have...

258
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,710
Sadaf is saying
natural is fashionable.

259
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,580
For eyebrows.

260
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,530
I'll dye my hair blue this summer.

261
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,690
Go ahead, and I'll blacklist you.

262
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,650
Remove your nail polish
before your dad comes.

263
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,540
I don't want problems.

264
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,690
What's wrong with you?

265
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,690
You dye your hair
and paint your nails.

266
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,650
Being a young girl
and a married woman

267
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,630
are different things.

268
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,630
What?

269
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,530
Nothing, I'm showing her my nails.

270
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,500
Is that so funny?

271
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,700
They look good.

272
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,580
It's Dad.

273
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,690
Yes, Iman?

274
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,570
Doesn't your mom like me?

275
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,630
Whatever.

276
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,520
She's constantly teasing me.

277
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,580
She's worrying
about this little pest.

278
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:41,630
Who's the hottest one here?

279
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,700
Ready, girls?

280
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,560
Why are you home so late?

281
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,660
You OK?

282
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,550
Iman...

283
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,540
Iman...

284
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,670
Have some of this,
it'll do you good.

285
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,660
Why don't you say anything?

286
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,550
They think
they can make me do anything.

287
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,530
Who?

288
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,530
My predecessor was fired

289
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,630
because he refused to sign
a death indictment.

290
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,700
Did they ask you to do something?

291
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,510
To sign the same indictment.

292
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,660
Is it unjust?

293
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,610
I don't know.

294
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,680
Do not sign.

295
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,700
It's the prosecutor's order.

296
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,670
I have to obey to it.

297
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,730
If the prosecutor has given an order,

298
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,680
it's not in your hands, is it?

299
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,570
It's his responsibility.

300
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,570
That's what Ghaderi says.

301
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,600
That's a first instance judgment,

302
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,510
it can be contested.

303
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,520
There can be an appeal

304
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,720
or a plea procedure.

305
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,670
So why are you upset?

306
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,670
I'll get you something
that helps with sleep.

307
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,680
Hello?

308
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,620
Hi, are you feeling better?

309
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,640
Sorry I didn't wake up
to prepare your breakfast.

310
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,510
I'm glad.

311
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,680
I couldn't sleep last night.

312
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,690
I fell asleep at dawn.

313
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,600
Yes.

314
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,570
I missed my prayer.

315
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,650
Where?

316
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,610
Why?

317
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,500
I wanted to go shopping
with the girls.

318
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,700
Rezvan needs
some clothes for college

319
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,730
and Sana some stationery.

320
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,520
Then, we're not going.

321
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,530
If you say it's risky,
we'll stay home.

322
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,610
Don't worry.

323
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,640
OK, my love.

324
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,600
Sure, bye.

325
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:35,530
If they have stationery
from previous years,

326
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,700
they shouldn't buy more.

327
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,620
They'd better avoid wasting.

328
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,580
Two days before school starts,

329
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,530
parents flock
to school supplies shops

330
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,510
for their children.

331
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,690
Maryam Jafari for National TV

332
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,560
at Tehran's bazar.

333
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,640
Last night,

334
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,650
several neighborhoods

335
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,690
were the scene of protests

336
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,640
turned into riots by some individuals

337
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,550
who disturbed the peace
for a few hours.

338
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,520
Last night's incidents

339
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,550
caused widespread damage
to public property

340
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,610
as well as businesses.

341
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,730
The protests that took place

342
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:20,500
in some places in Tehran

343
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,680
quickly degenerated.

344
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,640
The rioters damaged
public and private property.

345
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,500
It's 8:55 pm

346
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,650
on Ghods square,

347
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,680
in front of the City Hall,
a car is burning...

348
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,690
They're getting beaten up!
And those lies on TV!

349
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,560
Has Sadaf arrived at her dorm?

350
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,680
Haven't heard from her yet.

351
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,630
Who do you think
you are?

352
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,500
You're coming on my land
to beat me?

353
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,730
Down with the dictator!

354
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,620
Down with the dictator!

355
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,710
Sadaf, are they shouting slogans
there too?

356
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,530
Yes.

357
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,510
- The neighbors!
- Let me see!

358
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,560
In the dorm?

359
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,700
Can't you hear? Listen.

360
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,510
Down with theocracy!

361
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,720
Did you shout too?

362
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,730
Yes and I took off my veil!

363
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,610
- Really?
- Awesome!

364
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,730
Down with the dictator!

365
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,670
You're crazy! What are you doing?

366
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,620
I sent you videos. Check them out.

367
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,730
It's all filtered,
I can't see anything.

368
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,720
I'll send you a VPN.

369
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,610
To me too!

370
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,510
Shut up!

371
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,710
You don't have to imitate me!

372
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,570
I wanna go on the net.

373
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,510
Send it, bye.

374
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,610
Little pest.

375
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,580
In the name of Mahsa Amini,
some fringe groups

376
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,650
called for rallies
that turned into riots.

377
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,620
We could have gone out for a pizza.

378
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:41,600
Staying one day at home
is more than you can take?

379
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,510
Don't you see this chaos?

380
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,730
What chaos?
People are living their lives.

381
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:49,550
You two think you know better
than your parents?

382
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:52,580
Setting fires and breaking glass
is living one's life?

383
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,700
They're not letting them protest.

384
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,700
Go ahead,
defend the rioters in court.

385
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,660
It's impossible to talk to you.

386
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,540
Quiet, I'm listening to the news.

387
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,550
Speculation about the cause of death
is circulating in the media,

388
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,710
from different sources.

389
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,650
She died as a result
of police violence.

390
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,650
Traces of blows were observed.

391
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,710
Traces of blows.

392
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,540
The security police

393
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,550
have released CCTV footage.

394
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,560
Here are the first images

395
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
to be released by the police.

396
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,530
From Uzbekistan, the President
ordered an emergency procedure.

397
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:33,620
The Minister of the Interior
has asked

398
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,510
his Security Officer

399
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,640
to quickly
and accurately determine

400
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,500
the causes of the incident
and report back.

401
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,700
On social media, some maintain

402
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,640
that Mahsa Amini died

403
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,620
as a result of police brutality.

404
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,590
She has visible injuries.

405
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,600
Widespread calls for rallies

406
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,640
were published on social media.

407
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,510
Among them...

408
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,670
Was she really killed for her hijab?

409
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,610
Not at all, she was sick.

410
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,550
She had a stroke.

411
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,520
How do you know?

412
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,660
It's what TV said.

413
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,720
The TV is always right?

414
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,590
No, you're always right.

415
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:13,580
She had heart issues
and had a stroke at the station.

416
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,540
She must have been so scared
that she had a stroke.

417
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,580
People have strokes every day.
Is it the regime's fault?

418
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,540
They don't all die
from fear of the police!

419
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,690
What if it was your daughter?

420
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,720
My daughter had better not be seen
in an outfit like that!

421
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,640
Why should people get arrested
for their outfit?

422
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,610
That's God's order,
the law of the country.

423
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,730
What if the law of the country
is wrong?

424
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,650
God's law cannot be wrong.

425
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:40,510
What makes you so sure
this is God's law?

426
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,650
What's the matter with you?

427
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,690
Go out and shout slogans!

428
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:46,650
Go dance on the streets bareheaded!

429
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,550
If your father knew
what's going on here!

430
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,680
Move it!

431
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,540
What's the matter with her?

432
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,670
What do I know?

433
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,660
The girls have grown.

434
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,530
They have opinions, questions.

435
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,730
They need you.

436
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,730
I'm not asking for anything.

437
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:35,570
But at this age,
a girl needs her father.

438
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,610
They're getting bored.

439
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,650
If I bug them too much,

440
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:43,620
they dig their heels in
and don't listen to me.

441
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,560
It's gonna be all right.

442
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,690
It's a phase.

443
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,530
The school and the college
are opening soon.

444
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,660
That will keep them busy.

445
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,700
Be patient.

446
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,520
Iman...

447
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,510
Did you sign the death indictment?

448
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,560
Did I have the choice?

449
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,690
"I submit to the one
who submits to You.

450
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,680
"I fight him who fights You.

451
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,540
Until the Last Day."

452
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,680
Iman...

453
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,530
I know you want to sleep.

454
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:54,570
But you remember you promised
you'd buy a dishwasher?

455
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,600
My hands and the girls'
are getting damaged.

456
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,500
Next week.

457
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,660
Remember not to take
your phone out of your bag.

458
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,650
I won't, Mom.

459
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,620
I'll pick you up at 1.

460
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,570
Bye.

461
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,730
Rezvan honey,

462
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:06,540
weren't you supposed
to distance yourself from her?

463
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,610
Sadaf is my only friend.

464
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,550
There's nothing wrong with that.

465
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,500
But be careful because of Dad's job.

466
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,640
I don't know
what you're talking about.

467
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,550
What does Dad do?

468
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,720
A sensitive job, like my brother's.

469
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,700
He's travelling all the time
and nobody knows where he is.

470
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,560
Do you know what he does?

471
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,610
I'm his sister and all I know
is that he's a military man.

472
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,550
But Dad, is he a judge,
an investigator, a military man?

473
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,510
I'm telling you
he has a sensitive job.

474
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,580
We have to be discreet.

475
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,660
When you get close to people,

476
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,730
you must always be careful
to avoid leaks.

477
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:48,630
What were you thinking
offering to pick up Sadaf?

478
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,690
Her dorm is on our way.

479
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:53,520
You don't want her in our home.

480
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,630
I'm 21 and you're controlling
all my relationships.

481
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:00,570
I'm not controlling,
I'm watching over my family.

482
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,680
You'll understand
when you're a mother.

483
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,660
Sadaf is here.

484
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,720
- Hello!
- Hi, how are you?

485
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,510
You're OK? Your parents too?

486
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,560
Yes, thank you.

487
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,620
I just talked to my mom.
She says hi.

488
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,570
That's nice of her.

489
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,570
Last night, it was crazy at the dorm.

490
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:32,640
Why?

491
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,550
They were all out chanting slogans.

492
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,630
You too?

493
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,550
Did your mom say
how it was in their city?

494
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:42,510
Yeah, people are very angry
everywhere.

495
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,690
They're not people
but a bunch of thugs.

496
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:47,700
Be careful not to mingle with them.

497
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,500
- Hello?
- Mom...

498
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,550
What's going on?

499
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,700
Come pick me up. The school's closed.

500
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,590
Why?

501
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,590
The girls are demonstrating.

502
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,670
At the school?

503
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,730
Yes, it's quite tense.

504
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,510
I'll turn around, I'm coming.

505
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,600
- Keep your distance, I'm coming.
- OK.

506
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,720
We are receiving messages

507
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,670
that the principals
are no longer noting absences.

508
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,660
We can officially skip school!

509
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,660
Before, we felt bad doing it.

510
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,600
Now, it's official.

511
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:59,710
Don't bother coming,
they won't let you in the door.

512
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,630
Basically, in the colleges
and in the highschools,

513
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,700
it's a free-for-all.

514
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,730
Bye.

515
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,540
Hi.

516
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,710
What's going on?

517
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,560
They were shouting slogans.

518
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,620
What slogans?

519
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,570
Women, life, freedom.

520
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,650
I can't reach Rezvan.

521
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,500
Let me try.

522
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,680
Maybe she's out of battery.

523
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,680
I think they cut the coverage
during the demonstrations.

524
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,510
Let's go pick her up.

525
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,730
Can't reach her.

526
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,610
What's he saying?

527
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,720
He says not this way, the other way.

528
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,540
But I can't go from there...

529
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,600
Rezvan...

530
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,530
Rezvan!

531
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,720
Iman...

532
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,690
What's new? Since what time?

533
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:03,560
No one knows
what time the college closed?

534
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,550
In that case,
she should be home by now!

535
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,510
How will I find my girl?

536
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,610
OK, I'll wait to hear from you.

537
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:18,600
Iman, call me, don't forget.

538
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:22,660
Hello?

539
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,610
Rezvan, where are you?

540
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,560
We're at home.

541
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,640
Don't come, Mom's here.

542
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,650
How is she?

543
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:32,670
Poor thing.

544
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:37,520
No, I've got this.

545
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,710
Stay close, I'll call you.

546
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,620
See you in a minute.

547
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,590
Mom...

548
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:58,620
I'm out of sanitary pads.

549
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:01,710
You got scared, honey?

550
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,540
I'll give you some of mine.

551
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,550
Sorry, but I need thin ones.

552
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:09,520
If you can't go, I'll buy some.

553
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,590
You've got a nerve!

554
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,510
You want to go out?

555
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,590
Certainly not, I'll go.

556
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,530
Thanks a lot.

557
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,660
Hello?

558
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:35,700
She's leaving the building now.

559
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,620
I'm coming down.

560
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,650
Go get painkillers.

561
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:56,670
Sadaf...

562
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,650
Take this.

563
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,520
Drink some water, sweetie.

564
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,590
It's OK, my love.

565
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:08,520
You'll get better.

566
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:11,700
Lean back.

567
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,610
Rezvan...

568
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:24,510
- What?
- Her face...

569
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:25,700
What should we do?

570
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,670
I have no idea.

571
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,640
Shouldn't we take her to a hospital?

572
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,710
- She says she'd be arrested.
- So what?

573
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,540
What if something happens?

574
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:39,530
If they arrest her, they won't
let her stay in the hospital.

575
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:40,720
They'd hurt her.

576
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,530
We have to find a safe doctor.

577
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,690
But how?

578
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,570
Mom...

579
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:49,680
Rezvan!

580
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,630
You're here?

581
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:56,500
Why didn't you call me?
I was worried sick.

582
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,510
What's going on?

583
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,620
There's nothing more I can do.

584
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:23,510
If something happens to her,
who will answer to her family?

585
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,590
She doesn't want her family to know.

586
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,520
It's none of our business.

587
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,510
It's my business.

588
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,650
Why doesn't she want them to know?

589
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,590
I don't know.

590
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:38,520
All I know is she's in danger
and we need to help her.

591
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,580
I can't allow you to.
It's too much responsibility.

592
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:43,680
Mom!

593
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,620
You saw her face.

594
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,530
Is it my fault?

595
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:49,520
She shouldn't have gone.

596
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,630
Gone where?

597
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:53,530
It was at college,
we got caught in the crowd.

598
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,730
I don't want this in this home.

599
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:58,500
Have you thought of your father?

600
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,520
You're responsible for him too.

601
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,670
Sadaf, what are you doing?

602
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:03,730
Sadaf!

603
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:06,550
I want to go.

604
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:07,710
You're not well.

605
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,610
You have to call your mom.

606
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:13,630
- OK.
- I'll take you.

607
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:15,580
- Mom!
- Don't bother.

608
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,640
Tell her I don't want her to take me.

609
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,650
Stay, we'll take you to a doctor.

610
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:21,600
Let me talk to her.

611
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,550
I'll call her a taxi.

612
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:24,610
Put her veil on.

613
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:26,520
Mom, let her stay, please.

614
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,710
The neighbors mustn't see her face.

615
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:32,680
Sorry, my love.

616
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,500
- I'll call you.
- OK.

617
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:39,620
Let's go.

618
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:26,590
By changing jobs,

619
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,570
you have also changed?

620
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:35,510
Why don't you answer my calls?

621
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,550
I was in a meeting.

622
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:42,680
And after the meeting?

623
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,720
I called several times.

624
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,650
Lots of times.

625
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,660
Let me in.

626
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,540
Today,

627
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:38,530
I had a complicated case.

628
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,510
It preoccupied me.

629
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:47,600
Complicated enough
to make you forget about your family?

630
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:51,680
A twenty-year-old boy.

631
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:58,610
No matter how strong you are,

632
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:01,660
how unfailing your faith is,

633
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:05,560
death sentences are overwhelming.

634
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,680
Out of bad luck,

635
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,630
the protests coincided

636
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:13,640
with my arrival at this position.

637
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,580
There are countless arrests.

638
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:21,710
From 14-year-olds
to 70-year-old men and women.

639
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:26,630
More of them every day.

640
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,630
Police stations are saturated.

641
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:33,660
We're asked to rush through them.

642
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:38,680
I have a few minutes
to make a decision.

643
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:43,690
100, 200, 300 cases a day.

644
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:45,630
What can I do?

645
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,590
Work is work.

646
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:54,700
Do you know how long it's been
since you had a meal with the girls?

647
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,620
Explain, reassure them.

648
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,630
Who reassures me?

649
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,720
Tomorrow morning, before leaving,
take the time to talk to them.

650
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,660
I can't.

651
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,500
I have to be in court very early.

652
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,620
I promise to be back for dinner.

653
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:18,520
Mom...

654
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:20,710
Hi, Dad.

655
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,650
Can you come?

656
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:24,700
Go, darling, I'm coming.

657
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:26,590
What is it?

658
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,680
They must have argued.

659
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,660
It looks great on you.

660
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:33,690
I'll be back.

661
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,720
Look what they're doing to her,
poor thing.

662
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,640
It's at the dorm?

663
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,570
Her friends filmed them secretly.

664
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,660
I told you she should have stayed.

665
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:52,710
On the contrary,

666
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:54,570
I was right.

667
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:57,590
They would come for her here.
What about your father?

668
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:58,620
I'll talk to him.

669
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,640
Stay here. What are you doing?

670
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,710
- I'll talk to him.
- About what?

671
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:07,510
I want to know where she is.
Nobody knows who took her.

672
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:08,690
Sadaf did nothing.

673
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,620
You father doesn't know about that.

674
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:11,670
Who does, then?

675
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,710
None of your business, you brat.

676
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,680
- Mom...
- You two listen to me.

677
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:21,540
The agents have her phone.
Do not call or text her.

678
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,540
Same goes for you, Sana.

679
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:26,720
She must have done something
to get arrested this way.

680
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,590
Mom, listen.

681
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,580
Sadaf did nothing.

682
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:33,620
I was with her.

683
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,660
I beg you, help her.

684
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:41,530
Never say again
that you were with her.

685
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:44,510
You were nowhere with her, got it?

686
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,670
I know someone who can help us.

687
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,640
I'll find her by tomorrow morning.

688
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,730
Now go to bed, phones off.
Go!

689
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,610
What did he say?

690
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:41,570
He got hit by buckshot.

691
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:49,690
Gosh! They're breaking in.

692
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,580
Oh no...

693
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:56,680
God.

694
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,690
They've pulled
her jacket over her head.

695
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:00,690
They've covered her head.

696
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:03,500
They're taking the kid...

697
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:15,550
Hello.

698
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,550
- How are you?
- Thanks.

699
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:19,580
How are the kids?

700
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,720
Fine, thank you.
How's Alireza?

701
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,580
Good, thanks.

702
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:27,690
He said Iman has become
an investigator, congratulations.

703
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:31,560
For now, it's mostly problems.

704
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,680
He's swamped.

705
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,720
Don't be ungrateful.

706
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,690
He'll have a big pay raise,
you'll be given official housing.

707
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:41,520
After a couple of years
in this position,

708
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,580
he'll be promoted
to the revolutionary court.

709
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:48,500
Then, you'll be all set.

710
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:50,580
Being a judge's wife is the best.

711
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,500
I wish the same for you.

712
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:54,640
We're not so lucky.

713
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,550
Alireza too should have be promoted
to an investigator, but...

714
01:04:58,590 --> 01:04:59,610
it didn't happen.

715
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:00,710
It's God's will.

716
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:03,650
For now, they're arresting
so many people.

717
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:07,550
Night and day, it never stops.

718
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:11,630
I know. Actually, I'm here
for a friend's daughter.

719
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:14,540
She got arrested
and her family hasn't heard from her.

720
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,600
When did it happen?

721
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,510
Last night, at her dorm.

722
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:21,520
Who arrested her?
Plainclothes cops?

723
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,530
Or special forces?

724
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:25,510
Plainclothes, I think.

725
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:29,510
Then it will take a while
before they know anything.

726
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:32,710
I've come to ask you
to do a good deed.

727
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:37,610
If you could search her name
in your base.

728
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,500
No promises, but send me her name

729
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:43,530
and also her identification number.

730
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:44,630
Sure.

731
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:47,510
I have to go. You see it's endless.

732
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,660
Thank you for taking the time.

733
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,650
No problem.

734
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:53,690
I don't want to interfere,

735
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:56,610
but these friends of yours
who ask you a favor

736
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:59,510
let their children
take part in riots.

737
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:01,710
- And then...
- Yes, I know.

738
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:06,560
These days, some unscrupulous people

739
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,670
have posted the addresses
and phone numbers

740
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:12,530
of judges, investigators,

741
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:14,660
or whoever works for the government.

742
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,630
They have found them
and put them on social media.

743
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,550
No, seriously?

744
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:23,620
Imagine, when they circulate
on the hostile media...

745
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:26,610
You need to choose
your acquaintances wisely.

746
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,630
We will, for sure.

747
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,670
Say hi to your family.

748
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:32,600
Thank you, Fatemeh.

749
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:37,540
Please, don't tell Alireza
about my request.

750
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:40,530
If he tells Iman,
he wouldn't like it.

751
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:42,730
Don't even say you saw me,
it's between us.

752
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:44,610
OK, no worries.

753
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:46,620
Take care. See you soon.

754
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,580
- See you.
- Bye.

755
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:05,660
Hi, Mom.

756
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:07,690
- What's new?
- Take these.

757
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:11,630
We need her identification number.

758
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,690
How are we gonna find that?

759
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,530
No idea.

760
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,710
You're talking like it's my fault.

761
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:22,590
She must have broken windows
or burnt tires.

762
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,730
That will teach her a lesson.

763
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:26,690
Call her family.

764
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:28,730
I told you she didn't do anything.

765
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:30,590
They were together.

766
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,620
Rezvan could have been
shot in the eye too.

767
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:35,560
What were you doing
with those rioters?

768
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,640
These loose women
in the streets, undressed.

769
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,660
Hello?

770
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,560
Hi, any news?

771
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:46,590
She needs the identification number.
Can you find it?

772
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:49,690
OK, try to find it
as soon as possible.

773
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:51,630
I'll wait for your call.

774
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:53,580
What the hell are you doing?

775
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:55,640
Who were you talking to?

776
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,650
What's wrong with you?
To a classmate.

777
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:01,520
Did you tell anyone we can help her?
Did you mention your father?

778
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:02,620
In what way?

779
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,560
Stop playing dumb.

780
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,620
How do your friends think
you're searching for her?

781
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:09,500
I didn't mention Dad.

782
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:12,530
- How then?
- I said my uncle knows someone.

783
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:14,650
How dare you mention your uncle?

784
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,580
If I ever hear you mention

785
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:18,540
your father or your uncle...

786
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:20,530
I didn't say anything, Mom!

787
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:21,720
I know what I can and can't say!

788
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:25,630
Stop threatening me
or I'm moving out!

789
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:27,540
Moving out, congrats!

790
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:31,530
What do you think this is? A hotel?
You're shameless!

791
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:34,600
- Don't close the door!
- Leave her alone!

792
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,520
Not like this, set it down.

793
01:08:56,710 --> 01:09:00,610
Take another one.
Move these aside, my hands are dirty.

794
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:04,640
- How should I cut it?
- In slices, the other way round.

795
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:07,720
Put it here.
The other way round.

796
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:09,670
Now cut it in slices.

797
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:12,640
Set it down.

798
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,500
- It's OK.
- You'll get burnt.

799
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:26,620
Turn them with this.

800
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:50,600
Down with theocracy!

801
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:31,680
Down with theocracy!

802
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:36,590
Each person killed

803
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:39,580
Is replaced by a thousand more

804
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,520
What's going on?

805
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:47,650
You're here?
I thought you forgot.

806
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,720
I rushed out of court.

807
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,680
My phone was off.

808
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,720
They're shouting in our building too.

809
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,500
The bastards.

810
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:00,700
We'll get rid of them.

811
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:03,730
They take advantage of the system

812
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:05,670
and they insult it.

813
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,540
There are more of them every night.

814
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:26,590
What if something happened?

815
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:29,700
Like what?

816
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:32,650
Don't you think of it?

817
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:36,690
If something happens,
what would they do to us?

818
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:42,670
Nothing will happen.

819
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:44,710
How can you be so sure?

820
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:46,620
We'll stop them.

821
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:49,710
Whoever confronts God
does it at their own risk.

822
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:55,680
There's agitation everywhere,
in colleges, schools.

823
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:57,610
Let them agitate.

824
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,560
Even schoolgirls

825
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,730
are in the streets bareheaded
chanting slogans.

826
01:13:05,530 --> 01:13:06,590
Where are the girls?

827
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:08,650
In their bedroom.
They're upset.

828
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:11,580
Some of Rezvan's friends
have been arrested.

829
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:15,500
Rezvan wasn't in the commotion,
was she?

830
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:16,600
No, she wasn't.

831
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:21,510
But one of her close friends
was arrested.

832
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:23,620
She's very worried about her.

833
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:26,510
Why does she have
that kind of friend?

834
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:30,640
I can't make their friends
undergo a merit test.

835
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:34,710
They met at college and became close.

836
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:39,660
Poor kid came to Tehran for college
and ends up in jail.

837
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,620
But she hasn't done anything.

838
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:46,580
All the families say
the indictees did nothing.

839
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:50,610
I'm telling you,
she really did nothing.

840
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,700
She found herself
in the middle of the rally.

841
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,540
There we go.

842
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:57,690
Being in a rally
is a five-year sentence.

843
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:01,510
OK, fine.

844
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,680
All I want to know
is if you can find

845
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,500
her whereabouts for her family.

846
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,600
How?

847
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,610
God knows where she is.

848
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:12,560
They'll have to wait.

849
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,710
- They're so many of them.
- How long?

850
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:16,620
Until she talks.

851
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,560
She'll be kept
in solitary confinement

852
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,580
until she confesses
in front of a camera.

853
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,690
Confess? She's done nothing.

854
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,600
How do you know she's done nothing?

855
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:34,730
Anyway.

856
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:38,670
Can you try to find out how she is?

857
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:39,680
Just that.

858
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:42,690
No. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.

859
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:45,730
At this stage, it's out of my hands.

860
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:03,670
Nothing but lies. Turn it off.

861
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:08,720
What'd you say, honey?

862
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:11,730
Nothing.

863
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:15,670
You said something.

864
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:20,510
I said we should turn off the TV
during dinner.

865
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:21,620
Before.

866
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:33,500
I said it was nothing but lies.

867
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:35,580
Sweet Lord.

868
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,560
How do you know?

869
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:45,720
I live in this country.

870
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,730
I've got eyes.

871
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:52,650
Are you sure? It could be the enemy
that's persuading you.

872
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,590
What enemy, Dad?

873
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,660
My friends were beaten and arrested
before my eyes.

874
01:15:58,630 --> 01:15:59,670
Listen,

875
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:03,560
I know there's room for improvement.

876
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,570
But you guys don't realize
that the whole world is against us.

877
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:08,730
This is all an enemy plot.

878
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:11,530
What plot?

879
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:14,550
I don't care about the enemy
or some conspiracy theory.

880
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:17,550
A girl my age
was killed because of her hijab.

881
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:18,570
Why?

882
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,530
See, your facts aren't straight.

883
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:23,610
She had a stroke.

884
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:27,630
But through the media,
the enemy brainwashed you

885
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:29,590
into believing she was killed.

886
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:32,550
So why do they refuse to investigate?

887
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:35,660
Why don't they let an independent
commission take action?

888
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:38,660
They're killing all these people
simply to deny killing her?

889
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,580
You're going too far.

890
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:45,660
Me and thousands of others,

891
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:49,580
are slaving away
to preserve this country for whom?

892
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:50,660
For you!

893
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:52,570
You are defending

894
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:55,640
a bunch of sluts who just want
to walk the street naked!

895
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,550
Who wants to walk naked?

896
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:58,690
The people in the streets!

897
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:00,600
Who, Dad?

898
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:04,510
I happened to be
in the crowd yesterday.

899
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,550
You had no right to!

900
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:07,670
It was a coincidence.

901
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,560
I was leaving the college
with my friend.

902
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,520
They shot her in the face
with buckshot.

903
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,600
And then they arrested her
at her dorm.

904
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,650
Even if she lives,
she'll lose an eye.

905
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:22,500
Her beauty is gone,
her bright future too.

906
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:23,630
Why?

907
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:25,660
Listen, every day,

908
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:29,500
I interrogate
thousands of people like her.

909
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:32,500
- I know who they're involved with.
- Who?

910
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:36,500
They're just normal people
who want a normal life and freedom.

911
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:37,580
Just like anywhere else.

912
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,570
Good God.

913
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:41,690
Stop arguing with your father!

914
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,610
If not as a father,

915
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:47,550
as an expert who's been serving
this regime for 20 years,

916
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:48,720
don't you think I know better?

917
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,560
No.

918
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:56,650
You don't, Dad.

919
01:17:57,670 --> 01:17:59,600
Because you're on the inside.

920
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:00,680
You believe in it.

921
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,680
You want to preserve it at all cost.

922
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:15,570
Iman...

923
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,700
For once we were having
a family dinner, you ruined it.

924
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:50,600
Iman...

925
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:53,630
Iman.

926
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:09,590
Here, have some water.

927
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,590
You OK?

928
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:47,560
Najmeh...

929
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,510
Najmeh dear.

930
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,590
Yes?

931
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:53,580
Where have you put my gun?

932
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,520
Your gun?

933
01:20:58,610 --> 01:21:00,500
I don't know.

934
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,540
I didn't touch it.

935
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,710
My God...

936
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:07,540
Are you sure you had it
when you came home?

937
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:19,670
- I came in, you were at the window.
- Yes.

938
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:23,500
I took off my jacket,
threw it on the bed.

939
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:25,500
I put the gun...

940
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:27,660
in the drawer and then...

941
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:29,600
I sat down here.

942
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:32,680
I didn't mention it,
but the other evening,

943
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,710
you left it in the bathroom.

944
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:37,550
I found it there
when I picked up the laundry.

945
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:40,520
I put it away in this drawer.

946
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:56,680
You'll find it.

947
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:12,500
The kids!

948
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:14,540
Where are you going?

949
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:16,550
They may have taken it.

950
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:18,670
Take your gun?

951
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:20,580
Can you ask them?

952
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:23,570
You want me to wake them up
to ask them about your gun?

953
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:24,680
Yes, I do!

954
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:00,630
Rezvan...

955
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:02,710
Sweetheart...

956
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,640
Wake up, please.

957
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:09,560
What's going on?

958
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,600
Your Dad's gun is not in its place.

959
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,530
Do you know where it is?

960
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:14,600
What?

961
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,550
A gun?

962
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,520
Dad has a gun?

963
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,600
No, nothing.

964
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,660
Go back to sleep.

965
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:37,600
- So?
- I told you, it scared her.

966
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,550
They didn't even know you have a gun.

967
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:43,580
God...

968
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:49,690
Iman...

969
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:54,510
Maybe you've left it in court.

970
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:56,520
Go check.

971
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:09,510
Six months to three years in jail.

972
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,720
Worse than the sentence,

973
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:18,570
is the discredit.

974
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:24,630
You've been here
less than two weeks.

975
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:30,530
Such an embarrassment.

976
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:32,500
There'd be talk.

977
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,610
They'll say you were incapable

978
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:41,540
of keeping your gun for a few days.

979
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:45,610
Your merits will be questioned.

980
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:49,610
They'll lose faith in you.

981
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,610
Prevent you from moving up.

982
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:56,590
I'll find it.

983
01:25:56,630 --> 01:25:58,570
You have to find it.

984
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:02,530
For now, don't report it,

985
01:26:02,570 --> 01:26:04,590
don't say anything to anyone.

986
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:07,710
Based on what you're saying,

987
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,700
it's in your house, without a doubt.

988
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,660
Maybe if you just wait a few days,

989
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:17,530
the one who's taken it
will put it back.

990
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:28,510
Don't repeat yourself.

991
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:30,570
Where would I have left it?

992
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,550
Najmeh, think back
to what she said last night,

993
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:34,710
it just has to be at home.

994
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:36,560
Yes.

995
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:40,540
Keep me up to date.

996
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:45,620
Put them properly on the desk.

997
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:54,620
- And the top one?
- It's empty!

998
01:27:03,670 --> 01:27:05,640
These are my underwear!

999
01:28:14,650 --> 01:28:16,560
In my own home,

1000
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:20,650
I don't feel safe.

1001
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:24,650
Be patient, my love.

1002
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,560
These things happen in every family.

1003
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:32,650
Next month,

1004
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:36,560
it will be 21 years, right?

1005
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,620
21 years.

1006
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:44,500
Up in smoke.

1007
01:28:47,730 --> 01:28:50,550
All my professional credibility.

1008
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:56,640
You can't lose your credibility

1009
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:59,650
because of something
that's out of your hands.

1010
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:02,680
Don't be so worried.

1011
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:06,680
Yes.

1012
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:10,530
I can.

1013
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:17,610
But I won't let it happen.

1014
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:07,590
Dad is about to have a stroke.

1015
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:10,730
If something happens to him,
it's your fault.

1016
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:12,730
Really, Mom?

1017
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:15,730
You said people had strokes every day

1018
01:30:16,530 --> 01:30:19,520
and it was no one's fault,
just bad luck.

1019
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,730
But if it's Dad, it's our fault?

1020
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:24,610
You've got some nerve.

1021
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:30,720
If this damn gun is not found,
your dad will do 3 years of jail.

1022
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:32,600
3 years.

1023
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,590
Why do you assume it's us?

1024
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:41,540
We could point the finger at her.

1025
01:30:42,650 --> 01:30:43,700
Don't know.

1026
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:57,500
Sana, what's going on with her?

1027
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:01,590
Mom, aren't you eating?

1028
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:04,590
No.

1029
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:05,670
Why?

1030
01:31:16,570 --> 01:31:17,590
Mom...

1031
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:19,590
Mom!

1032
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:27,500
You don't realize
what you're doing to him.

1033
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:28,730
What are we doing?

1034
01:31:29,530 --> 01:31:31,550
If you'd grown up like me

1035
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:34,660
with a father who only cared about
gambling and partying,

1036
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:36,650
you'd be more grateful.

1037
01:31:36,690 --> 01:31:39,520
You'd honor your father.

1038
01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:41,690
I understand, Mom.

1039
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:45,500
I know you suffered as a child.

1040
01:31:45,730 --> 01:31:48,710
But why do you always think
Dad is right?

1041
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:52,570
Why would Sana and I
take the gun?

1042
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:55,510
So it just flew away?

1043
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:56,730
Maybe Dad is lying...

1044
01:31:57,530 --> 01:31:59,550
Mind what you say about your father!

1045
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:02,560
OK, the gun was in the drawer

1046
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,730
of his nightstand.

1047
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,590
Do you really think Sana and I

1048
01:32:06,630 --> 01:32:08,650
would dare come in
while you're asleep

1049
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:11,590
and take it from the drawer?

1050
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:14,660
What are we talking about anyway?

1051
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:18,550
Dad is so spaced out these days,
he's left it somewhere

1052
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:20,650
and he's taking it out on us.

1053
01:32:20,690 --> 01:32:22,600
She's right, Mom.

1054
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:23,730
Think about it.

1055
01:32:28,530 --> 01:32:29,560
Here, eat.

1056
01:32:29,690 --> 01:32:30,720
Mom...

1057
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:36,630
You shouldn't have told your family

1058
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:38,520
about your work.

1059
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:39,690
I should have hidden it?

1060
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:41,500
Of course.

1061
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:42,590
Until when?

1062
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:43,670
To the grave.

1063
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:48,680
I'm in deep shit.

1064
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:52,510
It's normal.

1065
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:55,650
In our training, they don't teach

1066
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:59,550
an investigator
how to interrogate their family.

1067
01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:07,560
Don't you suspect any of them?

1068
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:12,570
I can't believe my daughters did it.

1069
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,630
And your wife?

1070
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:16,730
I have absolute confidence in her.

1071
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:18,550
Really?

1072
01:33:23,730 --> 01:33:26,670
There's only one way
to find out who did it.

1073
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,700
What?

1074
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:30,550
Alireza.

1075
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:32,580
Take them to him.

1076
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,710
- To Alireza?
- Yes.

1077
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:44,520
He's the best interrogator there is.

1078
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:48,580
He has psychological tricks,
he'll figure it out quickly.

1079
01:33:49,570 --> 01:33:50,620
How could I?

1080
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,600
He comes over often.

1081
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,540
Our wives are friends.

1082
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:57,550
Our kids are friends.

1083
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:00,500
How can he interrogate my family?

1084
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:01,660
Why interrogate?

1085
01:34:04,530 --> 01:34:06,720
He uses psychology
and body language techniques.

1086
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:10,530
He'll tell you who's got it.
Isn't that worth it?

1087
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:11,700
You want to be let go?

1088
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,600
You want us both to be on the hook?

1089
01:34:14,710 --> 01:34:17,530
Make this go away.

1090
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,560
I won't take them to him.

1091
01:34:23,690 --> 01:34:25,700
Do you know anyone safer?

1092
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,550
Any better way?

1093
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:29,710
Tell yourself it's a therapy session.

1094
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:57,560
Alireza and Fatemeh are our friends.

1095
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,720
They don't need to know about
our personal problems.

1096
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,530
I told him not to mention it
to his family.

1097
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:07,510
They're a couple.
They tell each other everything.

1098
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:10,730
How dare you have your children
interrogated by your friend?

1099
01:35:11,530 --> 01:35:12,630
Why interrogate?

1100
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,590
It's a psychotherapy session.

1101
01:35:15,630 --> 01:35:18,620
He'll make sure
they don't recognize him.

1102
01:35:22,570 --> 01:35:25,660
After this,
who can the girls confide in?

1103
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:27,680
You?

1104
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:29,580
Me?

1105
01:35:29,650 --> 01:35:30,720
Their friends?

1106
01:35:34,690 --> 01:35:36,570
What can I do?

1107
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:40,530
If they find out at court,
do you know what will happen?

1108
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:45,520
If they discover
the gun was taken from my home?

1109
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:52,630
We'll see him for half an hour,
he'll do the interviews

1110
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:53,670
and make his diagnosis.

1111
01:35:53,710 --> 01:35:55,650
We'll be done with it.

1112
01:35:56,630 --> 01:35:58,650
He's a specialist.

1113
01:36:03,650 --> 01:36:05,640
Is it filmed?

1114
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,580
What?

1115
01:36:07,710 --> 01:36:10,600
You said interrogations are filmed.

1116
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:13,640
Of course not,
what are you talking about?

1117
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:18,590
What will we tell the girls?

1118
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:22,510
That it's a therapy session.

1119
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:39,600
It's here.

1120
01:36:41,690 --> 01:36:43,540
It won't take long.

1121
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:46,540
I'll wait for you.

1122
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:47,670
OK.

1123
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:49,670
Let's go, girls.

1124
01:37:32,650 --> 01:37:33,630
Hello.

1125
01:37:33,670 --> 01:37:35,570
Hello, come in.

1126
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:36,620
Come in.

1127
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:40,560
Arms up.

1128
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:41,660
Come on.

1129
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:47,650
The other one too.
You have something on you?

1130
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:49,570
Go sit.

1131
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:51,540
Come on, quick.

1132
01:37:52,510 --> 01:37:54,580
Arms up, legs spread.

1133
01:37:58,500 --> 01:37:59,660
Go sit there too.

1134
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:03,610
- What do you have on you?
- Nothing.

1135
01:38:03,650 --> 01:38:05,660
- A phone in your bag?
- Yes.

1136
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:07,540
Let me see.

1137
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:08,720
Arms up.

1138
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:11,520
Legs spread.

1139
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:15,680
Go wait there.

1140
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:32,600
Mom...

1141
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,710
Yes, honey?

1142
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:36,570
Come here.

1143
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:48,710
Girls, this way.

1144
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:51,670
Get up.

1145
01:38:52,630 --> 01:38:53,660
Let's go.

1146
01:39:02,530 --> 01:39:03,670
It's on your right.

1147
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:08,650
You're here and you're there.

1148
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:30,560
Hello.

1149
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,540
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

1150
01:39:33,580 --> 01:39:35,590
- Fatemeh is fine?
- Thank God.

1151
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:36,720
Reyhaneh and Amir Mahdi too?

1152
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:38,600
Yes, thank you.

1153
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,600
Follow me.

1154
01:39:40,730 --> 01:39:42,660
You want to talk to me too?

1155
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:44,630
I have a few small questions.

1156
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:46,650
Iman said it's just the girls.

1157
01:39:46,690 --> 01:39:48,570
Please, this way.

1158
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:26,520
Don't turn, face the wall.

1159
01:40:35,650 --> 01:40:37,720
- Can you see here?
- Where?

1160
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:39,560
Down here.

1161
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:41,610
Could you write?

1162
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:43,590
No, I can't see.

1163
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:46,730
- And now?
- Yes.

1164
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:50,680
Don't move, I'll be back.

1165
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:08,590
I cannot believe
the girls would have taken the gun.

1166
01:41:09,710 --> 01:41:13,550
In general, the criminal
is not the one you imagine.

1167
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:17,670
What crime are we talking about?

1168
01:41:18,590 --> 01:41:21,680
I'm sure Iman has left it somewhere.

1169
01:41:22,670 --> 01:41:25,580
You know how it's been lately.

1170
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:28,730
You are all under pressure
due to all of the arrests.

1171
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:31,670
Iman is really perturbed.

1172
01:41:32,630 --> 01:41:35,520
He's had to sign a few indictments

1173
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,620
that have deeply troubled him.

1174
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:39,680
I see.

1175
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:44,540
But Iman is sure he put it away
in its place at home.

1176
01:41:44,630 --> 01:41:48,510
He told me the same thing,
but it's unlikely.

1177
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:52,580
The other night, he came home
very upset and went for a shower.

1178
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:55,590
Then I found the gun
in the bathroom.

1179
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:57,600
Just by chance.

1180
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:59,650
I put it in its place.

1181
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:03,530
So you think
the gun is not at your home.

1182
01:42:03,690 --> 01:42:04,710
Yes.

1183
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:11,710
And you?

1184
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:14,510
What about me?

1185
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:18,620
Might you know where it is?

1186
01:42:19,730 --> 01:42:21,710
What do you mean?

1187
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,590
I would have taken it?

1188
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:28,550
You just said
you're sure it's not in your home.

1189
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:33,610
Well, thank you.

1190
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:35,710
Thank Iman.

1191
01:42:36,510 --> 01:42:38,530
Don't take it badly.

1192
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:42,540
Iman told me
he has absolute confidence in you.

1193
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:44,580
But everyone knows

1194
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:47,580
sometimes between
mother and daughters,

1195
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,570
there are secrets.

1196
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:53,610
Absolutely not.

1197
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:56,580
Why would I hide this
from my husband?

1198
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:57,660
God as my witness,

1199
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:00,680
I've always been transparent
with Iman.

1200
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:06,590
Yet I know

1201
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:09,650
there are things
that Iman doesn't know.

1202
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:15,680
Stay seated, please.

1203
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:18,670
You're speaking in an offending way.

1204
01:43:18,710 --> 01:43:20,510
Sit down.

1205
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:29,560
I'm speaking to you
very respectfully.

1206
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:34,690
Never has a person sitting there
been treated with such respect.

1207
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:42,540
Be reassured,

1208
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:44,700
all this will remain between us.

1209
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:49,680
I'm the keeper of secrets.

1210
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:56,630
I thought perhaps this issue
might be one of those

1211
01:43:56,670 --> 01:43:59,570
that you have decided
to hide from Iman.

1212
01:44:00,570 --> 01:44:04,520
I can't understand this disaster
taking over my life.

1213
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:08,710
Be precise and thorough.

1214
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:12,680
Especially concerning the young girl
you were looking for.

1215
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:23,580
You, go to your room.

1216
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:25,520
No, stay.

1217
01:47:27,580 --> 01:47:29,540
We have nothing to hide.

1218
01:47:34,510 --> 01:47:36,580
Do you realize what you're doing?

1219
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:40,550
What am I doing?

1220
01:47:40,650 --> 01:47:42,630
Playing with your dad's reputation.

1221
01:47:42,710 --> 01:47:44,610
The family's reputation.

1222
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:45,710
Sweetheart,

1223
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:51,540
this issue has the potential
to ruin my career.

1224
01:47:53,670 --> 01:47:55,610
I'll be put in jail.

1225
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:57,730
Don't you care?

1226
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:01,610
- It's not me...
- Who, then?

1227
01:48:04,670 --> 01:48:05,730
Rezvan,

1228
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:09,720
honey,

1229
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:11,580
don't be scared.

1230
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:14,560
No harm will come to you.

1231
01:48:14,690 --> 01:48:16,640
Just give me the gun back.

1232
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:18,600
What gun?

1233
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:21,510
Why won't you believe me?

1234
01:48:21,550 --> 01:48:23,720
You accuse me
because of what a stranger says!

1235
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:25,570
Where's the gun then?

1236
01:48:25,610 --> 01:48:27,650
Did it vanish into thin air?
Where is it?

1237
01:48:27,690 --> 01:48:29,500
I have no idea!

1238
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:31,540
Maybe you have it!

1239
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:50,670
Calm down, sweetie.

1240
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:57,550
All you've been given
is love and respect.

1241
01:49:01,730 --> 01:49:04,710
The best house, everything you need,

1242
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:07,590
a car, money...

1243
01:49:07,630 --> 01:49:09,570
What have you been missing?

1244
01:49:12,620 --> 01:49:14,610
I didn't take it, Dad.

1245
01:49:14,650 --> 01:49:16,600
I swear I didn't.

1246
01:49:16,710 --> 01:49:19,610
I swear on whatever you want.

1247
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:21,690
Why won't you believe me?

1248
01:49:21,730 --> 01:49:24,650
I didn't even know you had a gun.

1249
01:49:24,690 --> 01:49:26,560
Leave me alone.

1250
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:33,540
You won't believe me.
Leave me alone!

1251
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:36,580
I'll find it.

1252
01:49:37,590 --> 01:49:38,620
Mom...

1253
01:49:39,530 --> 01:49:40,720
Mom, wait...

1254
01:49:41,730 --> 01:49:44,580
What are you doing?

1255
01:49:44,620 --> 01:49:48,570
Please, don't start again.
You've already searched everywhere.

1256
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:49,590
Mom!

1257
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:51,640
Calm down, you're not well.

1258
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:53,500
Did she tell you anything?

1259
01:49:53,540 --> 01:49:54,710
It's my turn?

1260
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:57,510
Don't you want to have blue hair?

1261
01:49:57,550 --> 01:50:00,730
Your father will promise you can.
Go ahead, Iman.

1262
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:03,660
Sweetie,

1263
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:06,580
Rezvan isn't in her right mind.

1264
01:50:06,620 --> 01:50:09,720
If you know something, say so,
you'll do her a favor.

1265
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:14,530
And I'll let you dye your hair,
paint your nails.

1266
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:20,590
She didn't tell me anything.

1267
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:41,530
Sana knows something.

1268
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:45,500
I can see it in her eyes.

1269
01:50:47,660 --> 01:50:49,620
She's a child.

1270
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:52,600
This isn't the court, it's your home.

1271
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:55,610
A mistake has been made,
but as you said,

1272
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:58,540
one shouldn't burn bridges.

1273
01:51:01,540 --> 01:51:04,500
What curse has fallen upon me.

1274
01:51:06,570 --> 01:51:07,660
You have us.

1275
01:51:12,630 --> 01:51:14,550
They'll call me incompetent.

1276
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:16,530
Who?

1277
01:51:16,690 --> 01:51:20,600
I've always said
you built this life from nothing.

1278
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:22,650
With no support, on your own,

1279
01:51:22,690 --> 01:51:24,590
with no help.

1280
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:27,650
Iman...

1281
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:30,650
your dream is coming true.

1282
01:51:30,690 --> 01:51:34,580
You're only a few steps away
from the judge's chair.

1283
01:51:35,610 --> 01:51:36,650
Yes.

1284
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:38,720
A few steps.

1285
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:42,660
But fate has changed.

1286
01:51:45,710 --> 01:51:48,680
Your name is Iman.
How can you lose faith?

1287
01:51:51,580 --> 01:51:53,600
You'll make it right.

1288
01:51:59,510 --> 01:52:01,560
I'd like to hug Rezvan.

1289
01:52:01,690 --> 01:52:03,510
Kiss Sana.

1290
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:06,730
Go ahead, hug them, kiss them.

1291
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:08,610
Now?

1292
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:22,510
Najmeh...

1293
01:52:22,630 --> 01:52:23,670
Yes, my love?

1294
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:27,680
Sana wants to have blue hair?

1295
01:52:28,670 --> 01:52:30,580
Painted nails?

1296
01:52:31,570 --> 01:52:32,620
Why?

1297
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:36,510
The world has changed.

1298
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:38,670
Kids think differently.

1299
01:52:39,530 --> 01:52:41,680
The world has changed,
but God has not.

1300
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:44,510
Nor his laws.

1301
01:52:45,610 --> 01:52:47,570
We have to teach them.

1302
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:49,610
We always have.

1303
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:53,560
Sana is going through puberty.

1304
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:56,570
She's influenced by her friends.

1305
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:59,520
She shouldn't see them.

1306
01:53:03,630 --> 01:53:06,680
You must spend more time with them.

1307
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:10,590
So that you get closer,
become more intimate.

1308
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:15,580
You have to help shape their ideas.

1309
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:20,680
Yes.

1310
01:53:40,690 --> 01:53:41,730
Najmeh.

1311
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:46,730
Yes, my love?

1312
01:53:47,590 --> 01:53:48,650
Come close to me.

1313
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:15,560
Mom!

1314
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:22,570
- What's that?
- Dad's contact info was posted.

1315
01:54:22,610 --> 01:54:24,590
Even our address.

1316
01:54:24,630 --> 01:54:26,550
Good God...

1317
01:54:26,620 --> 01:54:28,540
My Goodness.

1318
01:54:29,590 --> 01:54:30,660
Let me see.

1319
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:44,720
I told you to be careful.

1320
01:54:49,540 --> 01:54:51,620
They wanna do away with me.

1321
01:54:51,660 --> 01:54:53,640
You have to report it all.

1322
01:54:54,730 --> 01:54:57,650
Write a letter to the boss now.

1323
01:54:58,590 --> 01:55:01,550
Say your personal info
has been revealed online

1324
01:55:01,590 --> 01:55:03,590
and that you're in danger.

1325
01:55:03,710 --> 01:55:07,630
Ask for secure official housing.

1326
01:55:11,700 --> 01:55:14,650
Drop the letter off and rush home.

1327
01:55:15,610 --> 01:55:16,720
Take your family

1328
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:19,540
and go to a safe place for a while.

1329
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:21,580
Until things settle down.

1330
01:55:22,530 --> 01:55:23,610
I have two of them.

1331
01:55:23,650 --> 01:55:25,640
Keep one for now.

1332
01:55:31,610 --> 01:55:32,730
Thank you so much.

1333
01:59:05,580 --> 01:59:06,600
Yes?

1334
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:09,530
Yes?

1335
01:59:10,580 --> 01:59:11,600
Who is it?

1336
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:13,530
Nobody rang.

1337
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:29,630
Iman... you're OK?

1338
01:59:29,670 --> 01:59:31,580
Yes... I'm OK.

1339
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:33,520
What shall we do?

1340
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:34,710
Give me your phone.

1341
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:37,630
My phone? Here.

1342
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:42,600
Hi, Dad.

1343
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:43,680
Hi.

1344
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:45,540
Your phone.

1345
01:59:45,630 --> 01:59:46,700
Cut the music.

1346
01:59:56,570 --> 01:59:57,600
Your code.

1347
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:02,690
2003.

1348
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:05,510
Iman?

1349
02:00:06,630 --> 02:00:07,630
Iman?

1350
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:09,500
Sana.

1351
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:16,580
Your code.

1352
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:20,650
Give it to me.

1353
02:00:35,730 --> 02:00:37,610
Najmeh, your code.

1354
02:00:37,650 --> 02:00:39,570
You know it.

1355
02:00:43,660 --> 02:00:45,630
Everyone at the table in 10 minutes.

1356
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:07,710
I'm worried.

1357
02:01:09,510 --> 02:01:11,640
Strange things have been happening.

1358
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:14,680
We'll leave Tehran for a few days.

1359
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:17,650
We'll go to my birthplace.

1360
02:01:18,610 --> 02:01:20,680
You loved going there
when you were little.

1361
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:23,670
I haven't had time
to take you there lately.

1362
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:26,580
It's the right moment.

1363
02:01:27,620 --> 02:01:30,580
Over there we will become
the family we were.

1364
02:01:31,580 --> 02:01:33,660
And try to work things out.

1365
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:38,500
Get ready, we're leaving in an hour.

1366
02:03:23,570 --> 02:03:24,720
Dad, can I have my phone back?

1367
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:26,700
Rezvan, drop it.

1368
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:29,720
- I want to check on my friend.
- Get in the car.

1369
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:31,530
Come on, get in.

1370
02:03:58,630 --> 02:04:00,680
- Anything wrong?
- No.

1371
02:04:01,590 --> 02:04:03,660
You seem weird.
Did someone recognize you?

1372
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:05,710
They took photos and videos of us.

1373
02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:07,690
What are you going to do?

1374
02:04:07,730 --> 02:04:09,570
Masks on.

1375
02:04:09,610 --> 02:04:11,560
Girls, masks.

1376
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:13,640
Sana, wake up,

1377
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:14,710
put a mask on.

1378
02:04:15,510 --> 02:04:16,530
What's going on?

1379
02:04:16,570 --> 02:04:18,650
Dad and the car were filmed.

1380
02:04:18,690 --> 02:04:19,730
By who?

1381
02:04:20,530 --> 02:04:23,670
Iman, please, let's go.
You said it would be all over.

1382
02:04:23,710 --> 02:04:26,690
I won't let anyone hurt us.

1383
02:04:26,730 --> 02:04:28,580
Please, drop it.

1384
02:04:28,620 --> 02:04:31,530
Please, Dad, let's just go.

1385
02:04:31,570 --> 02:04:33,730
Are you sure he filmed us?

1386
02:04:34,530 --> 02:04:36,680
The glove box.
Take out your phone.

1387
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:39,730
When I tell you,
film his car with the license plate.

1388
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:08,550
She's also filming us.

1389
02:05:08,590 --> 02:05:10,500
You're going too fast.

1390
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:25,630
Don't you see the girls are scared?

1391
02:05:29,660 --> 02:05:31,560
Careful, Dad!

1392
02:05:33,590 --> 02:05:34,630
Dad!

1393
02:05:43,730 --> 02:05:45,630
We'll crash!

1394
02:05:46,540 --> 02:05:47,670
Please, drop it!

1395
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:30,510
Stay in the car.

1396
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:32,560
So, investigator, you're scared?

1397
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:34,700
Afraid your family
will find out what you do?

1398
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:36,600
Your father is an executioner!

1399
02:06:36,690 --> 02:06:38,540
Drop your phone.

1400
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:40,580
Go ahead, shoot, if you dare!

1401
02:06:40,620 --> 02:06:41,660
His gun!

1402
02:06:42,510 --> 02:06:44,520
He didn't tell us he found it.

1403
02:06:45,540 --> 02:06:46,720
It's another one.

1404
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:49,630
What have you done, Sana?

1405
02:06:50,670 --> 02:06:52,570
- Give it to me.
- I'll keep it.

1406
02:06:52,610 --> 02:06:53,620
Leave it!

1407
02:06:53,660 --> 02:06:55,520
Dad's lost it.
Grab the phones.

1408
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:56,720
Let's call Uncle Assad.

1409
02:06:57,520 --> 02:06:58,580
Shut up, you whore!

1410
02:06:58,620 --> 02:07:01,640
Do you know how many death
sentence requests he's signed?

1411
02:07:01,720 --> 02:07:03,650
There's no signal!

1412
02:07:03,690 --> 02:07:05,720
Have you read about him?

1413
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:08,680
- Sana, quick!
- I have no signal!

1414
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:12,520
I'm better than you
who feeds on the blood of the people.

1415
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:16,670
- Call Assad...
- There's no signal.

1416
02:07:16,710 --> 02:07:19,730
I'm streaming this live to the world
to put you to shame.

1417
02:07:20,530 --> 02:07:21,720
She's lying, there's no signal.

1418
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:23,710
She can't send anything.

1419
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:27,520
Throw your phone.

1420
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:29,710
I swear I'll shoot!

1421
02:07:30,510 --> 02:07:32,710
Throw it, he may really shoot!

1422
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:36,520
Tie her up.

1423
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:38,550
ID and phone.

1424
02:07:38,590 --> 02:07:40,550
- Hands behind your back.
- Quick!

1425
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:12,640
- Not you!
- Here we are!

1426
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:14,640
It's a couple's photo.

1427
02:09:15,570 --> 02:09:17,510
I've got you.

1428
02:09:17,730 --> 02:09:18,730
Daddy!

1429
02:09:21,590 --> 02:09:22,660
- Yes?
- Sing.

1430
02:09:22,710 --> 02:09:24,630
What song?

1431
02:09:24,670 --> 02:09:26,530
"From my heart"

1432
02:09:26,570 --> 02:09:27,550
No, another one.

1433
02:09:27,590 --> 02:09:28,700
Please, Daddy.

1434
02:09:30,730 --> 02:09:32,550
No, I said!

1435
02:09:32,590 --> 02:09:34,560
- Yes, sir!
- Good boy.

1436
02:09:47,590 --> 02:09:49,580
So you found the gun?

1437
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:53,700
No, I didn't.

1438
02:09:56,660 --> 02:10:00,500
This is Ghaderi's. He lent it to me.

1439
02:10:04,690 --> 02:10:07,630
So the nightmare is not over.

1440
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:10,570
Soon.

1441
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:17,520
Shit.

1442
02:10:18,680 --> 02:10:20,600
It must be the fuses.

1443
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:22,500
I'll check.

1444
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:29,550
Sana...

1445
02:11:29,620 --> 02:11:30,640
Thanks.

1446
02:11:32,610 --> 02:11:34,670
- I put it here?
- Yes, thanks.

1447
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:38,570
It's so nice of you.

1448
02:11:38,610 --> 02:11:39,700
My pleasure.

1449
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:41,570
A feast of a breakfast.

1450
02:11:41,610 --> 02:11:43,510
It's only normal.

1451
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:45,690
Thank you.

1452
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:51,520
Dad, when will we have
our phones back? It's boring here.

1453
02:11:51,730 --> 02:11:54,670
Be patient, you'll have them.

1454
02:12:01,550 --> 02:12:02,700
You think it's which one?

1455
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:04,690
The one with the plaid shirt.

1456
02:12:04,730 --> 02:12:08,510
That's Uncle Ali, for sure.
I think he's the other one.

1457
02:12:08,550 --> 02:12:09,520
Dad!

1458
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:10,660
- Is it you?
- Yes.

1459
02:12:10,700 --> 02:12:12,670
It's at the Imam Reza shrine.

1460
02:12:12,710 --> 02:12:14,660
Why are you doing this?

1461
02:12:14,700 --> 02:12:18,660
It's a gesture of submission,
faith, absolute obedience.

1462
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:21,630
I see, what Dad expects from us.

1463
02:12:21,670 --> 02:12:23,620
It's not for me,

1464
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:24,680
it's for God.

1465
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:27,720
Why are you interfering
in our relationship with God?

1466
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:29,720
- Sana!
- Let her talk.

1467
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:31,680
That's no way to talk.

1468
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:33,590
I'm just asking a question.

1469
02:12:33,710 --> 02:12:37,660
In faith, there are no questions.
You have to feel it in your bones.

1470
02:12:38,540 --> 02:12:40,620
Woe to him who loses his faith.

1471
02:12:55,650 --> 02:12:58,570
What's undermining our family
is lies.

1472
02:12:59,550 --> 02:13:01,560
I don't care about the gun anymore.

1473
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:03,500
I want the liar.

1474
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:09,520
I want my family back.

1475
02:13:09,610 --> 02:13:12,500
You have one hour
to hand over the liar.

1476
02:13:19,690 --> 02:13:21,690
It shouldn't have come to this.

1477
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:26,710
Why does he get to do
whatever he wants?

1478
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:31,610
He's the first liar.
For years he hid his job from us.

1479
02:13:32,540 --> 02:13:33,720
We're up against the wall.

1480
02:13:34,580 --> 02:13:36,540
I know your father well.

1481
02:13:36,580 --> 02:13:38,660
- Whoever's done it needs to give in.
- Mom...

1482
02:13:38,700 --> 02:13:40,640
I'm begging you.

1483
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:43,730
No matter who did it,
just stop playing around.

1484
02:13:44,530 --> 02:13:45,590
Give it to me.

1485
02:13:45,630 --> 02:13:47,580
I stole it, I'm the liar.

1486
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:49,620
You always give in to him.

1487
02:13:50,550 --> 02:13:54,540
I've always made sure you never see
your father's true colors.

1488
02:13:55,540 --> 02:13:57,510
Which of you has the gun?

1489
02:14:05,530 --> 02:14:06,640
We don't know anything.

1490
02:14:07,730 --> 02:14:10,540
Is that your final word?

1491
02:14:11,500 --> 02:14:12,500
Fine.

1492
02:14:30,530 --> 02:14:31,580
Sit down.

1493
02:14:36,670 --> 02:14:37,730
So,

1494
02:14:39,570 --> 02:14:41,700
I've been living with a liar
for 20 years.

1495
02:14:50,570 --> 02:14:52,610
Can the girls go out?

1496
02:14:57,570 --> 02:14:58,670
Why?

1497
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:01,560
Let them see.

1498
02:15:06,530 --> 02:15:08,510
What else did you lie about?

1499
02:15:11,690 --> 02:15:14,570
I didn't lie about anything else.

1500
02:15:17,550 --> 02:15:21,650
From the start, you were excited
to have this gun at home.

1501
02:15:21,690 --> 02:15:23,630
But I was scared.

1502
02:15:25,710 --> 02:15:27,600
Where's the gun?

1503
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:33,630
I threw it into the canal
near our house.

1504
02:15:37,550 --> 02:15:38,600
One lie

1505
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:40,540
after the other.

1506
02:15:43,590 --> 02:15:45,720
Are you taking the blame
for the girls?

1507
02:15:49,600 --> 02:15:50,670
I'm not lying.

1508
02:15:50,710 --> 02:15:53,720
I made a mistake, I apologize.

1509
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:55,600
Please forgive me.

1510
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:59,710
Let's go back home
and I'll show you where I threw it.

1511
02:16:00,510 --> 02:16:02,620
We might find it.

1512
02:16:07,570 --> 02:16:10,590
Explain when and how
you stole the gun.

1513
02:16:13,690 --> 02:16:16,600
The night you had a nightmare,

1514
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:19,580
I woke you up
and gave you some water.

1515
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:20,690
Remember?

1516
02:16:22,590 --> 02:16:23,730
You went to the living room.

1517
02:16:24,670 --> 02:16:27,610
I took it then.

1518
02:16:32,540 --> 02:16:33,640
Where did you hide it?

1519
02:16:34,530 --> 02:16:35,680
When did you throw it?

1520
02:16:40,620 --> 02:16:41,660
I hid it

1521
02:16:42,540 --> 02:16:45,530
in the freezer,
between pieces of meat.

1522
02:16:47,730 --> 02:16:49,510
Then,

1523
02:16:49,550 --> 02:16:53,550
in the morning, when you left,
I went to throw it into the canal.

1524
02:16:55,660 --> 02:16:58,600
You didn't think
of your husband's reputation?

1525
02:17:01,630 --> 02:17:04,700
Iman, please, that's enough,
let's go back to Tehran.

1526
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:07,600
I'll tell everyone it was me.

1527
02:17:07,640 --> 02:17:10,520
I won't let you be harmed.

1528
02:17:10,560 --> 02:17:11,670
The girls are really scared.

1529
02:17:12,670 --> 02:17:14,630
I'll come to any court

1530
02:17:14,670 --> 02:17:17,510
to confess I took the gun.

1531
02:17:17,550 --> 02:17:19,590
You'll be off the hook,
don't be afraid.

1532
02:17:19,630 --> 02:17:21,620
I'm not afraid of anybody!

1533
02:17:23,540 --> 02:17:25,580
So what do you want the gun for?

1534
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:30,620
Enough, Mom, get up.

1535
02:17:30,660 --> 02:17:33,600
Stop it, I don't want you
to be involved in this.

1536
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:35,640
We've been involved
since the beginning.

1537
02:17:39,630 --> 02:17:41,570
I have your gun.

1538
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:44,620
It's here.

1539
02:17:45,610 --> 02:17:48,700
Ask Uncle Assad to come and pick up
Mom and Sana.

1540
02:17:49,620 --> 02:17:51,720
Then, I'll give it to you.

1541
02:18:01,650 --> 02:18:03,690
Are you making conditions for me?

1542
02:18:12,530 --> 02:18:14,550
Sit down in front of the camera.

1543
02:18:18,510 --> 02:18:19,540
I won't sit.

1544
02:18:24,650 --> 02:18:25,670
You will.

1545
02:18:31,530 --> 02:18:33,520
Rezvan sweetheart,

1546
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:35,670
come sit for a minute.

1547
02:18:35,710 --> 02:18:37,610
We'll talk.

1548
02:18:38,620 --> 02:18:39,670
Come, my love.

1549
02:18:39,710 --> 02:18:41,700
Let your father calm down.

1550
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:53,720
When and how you stole the gun,
for what motive?

1551
02:18:59,610 --> 02:19:00,600
I won't answer.

1552
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:02,620
Don't get smart with me!

1553
02:19:05,530 --> 02:19:06,670
Answer him.

1554
02:19:08,650 --> 02:19:10,500
I told you,

1555
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:12,560
I have it here, in the garden.

1556
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:15,620
Let Mom and Sana leave

1557
02:19:15,720 --> 02:19:17,500
and I'll give it to you.

1558
02:19:17,540 --> 02:19:18,680
Don't make conditions!

1559
02:19:21,530 --> 02:19:22,690
Rezvan, honey,

1560
02:19:23,650 --> 02:19:25,680
since you're saying
you have it here,

1561
02:19:26,560 --> 02:19:29,510
why don't you give it back to him?

1562
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:17,640
It's not here.

1563
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:23,600
You're all liars.

1564
02:20:24,670 --> 02:20:27,580
I swear I left it here.

1565
02:20:52,710 --> 02:20:54,530
You're hurting me!

1566
02:21:08,540 --> 02:21:09,630
Open the door!

1567
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:11,640
Open!

1568
02:21:12,580 --> 02:21:13,620
Mom!

1569
02:21:14,500 --> 02:21:14,720
Open!

1570
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:16,510
Iman!

1571
02:21:16,550 --> 02:21:17,690
Are you out of your mind?

1572
02:21:17,730 --> 02:21:19,660
You've gone crazy!

1573
02:21:20,690 --> 02:21:22,600
Mom, you're OK?

1574
02:21:22,730 --> 02:21:25,590
Rezvan, honey, I'm here.

1575
02:21:25,630 --> 02:21:27,710
Don't be scared, my love, I'm here.

1576
02:24:00,730 --> 02:24:02,540
Take this.

1577
02:24:05,570 --> 02:24:06,610
Open it!

1578
02:24:06,710 --> 02:24:07,720
Open it!

1579
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:09,700
Open the door!

1580
02:24:12,680 --> 02:24:14,610
Iman, where's Sana?

1581
02:24:15,590 --> 02:24:18,610
It's cold, she'll get sick.

1582
02:24:19,700 --> 02:24:23,510
It's not safe out there.
There are wild animals.

1583
02:24:23,630 --> 02:24:25,550
Let's go find her.

1584
02:24:26,580 --> 02:24:28,520
I don't want this!

1585
02:24:28,570 --> 02:24:29,730
What are you doing?

1586
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:32,630
We're your family!

1587
02:24:32,730 --> 02:24:34,730
My baby will get scared!

1588
02:24:35,530 --> 02:24:38,590
If something happens to her,
I'll never forgive you!

1589
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:39,630
Iman!

1590
02:24:39,690 --> 02:24:41,590
My baby's all alone!

1591
02:24:41,700 --> 02:24:43,530
She'll get lost!

1592
02:24:43,570 --> 02:24:44,650
Iman!

1593
02:26:48,630 --> 02:26:49,730
Where are you?

1594
02:26:50,630 --> 02:26:52,580
Can you hear me?

1595
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:56,540
Come open this door!

1596
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:58,710
Iman,
she needs to go to the bathroom!

1597
02:26:59,510 --> 02:27:00,540
Open up!

1598
02:27:00,580 --> 02:27:03,650
- I need to go!
- Open up, I'm telling you!

1599
02:27:05,670 --> 02:27:08,570
If you shout next time,
I won't open up.

1600
02:27:08,610 --> 02:27:10,700
Tap gently on the door...

1601
02:27:11,500 --> 02:27:13,500
- Mom!
- Let's go, quiet.

1602
02:27:16,620 --> 02:27:18,700
Go in, I'll put the power back on.

1603
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:20,550
I'm going to the toilet!

1604
02:28:05,700 --> 02:28:07,510
You brute!

1605
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:44,540
- Iman, take only me.
- Sure.

1606
02:31:44,580 --> 02:31:45,550
If they let me.

1607
02:31:45,590 --> 02:31:47,640
- Daddy!
- Wait.

1608
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:48,670
Let's do a selfie.

1609
02:31:48,710 --> 02:31:49,730
Daddy!

1610
02:31:51,580 --> 02:31:52,590
Yes, honey?

1611
02:31:52,630 --> 02:31:54,730
Stop saying Daddy for a second!

1612
02:31:55,600 --> 02:31:58,580
Dad, take one alone and then...

1613
02:32:44,550 --> 02:32:45,560
Sana!

1614
02:33:51,610 --> 02:33:52,720
Open the door!

1615
02:33:55,710 --> 02:33:57,600
Open up!

1616
02:33:59,580 --> 02:34:00,710
Damn it!

1617
02:34:18,690 --> 02:34:20,550
Sana, you're OK?

1618
02:34:31,700 --> 02:34:33,510
Where's your father?

1619
02:34:33,550 --> 02:34:35,530
He can't reach us!

1620
02:34:46,650 --> 02:34:47,660
The car key!

1621
02:34:47,700 --> 02:34:50,650
The gate is closed.
He'll be here soon!

1622
02:34:53,560 --> 02:34:54,670
No, this way!

1623
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:07,520
Come on!

1624
02:35:17,650 --> 02:35:18,690
Run!

1625
02:35:19,670 --> 02:35:20,700
Faster!

1626
02:35:24,600 --> 02:35:25,700
Come on, girls.

1627
02:35:27,650 --> 02:35:29,510
Let's separate!

1628
02:36:52,610 --> 02:36:53,610
Mom...

1629
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:56,530
Sana...

1630
02:38:58,730 --> 02:39:00,730
- Rezvan!
- Mom!

1631
02:39:02,710 --> 02:39:04,560
What the hell are you doing?

1632
02:39:04,600 --> 02:39:06,530
- Run!
- Najmeh!

1633
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:27,600
Get out of my way.

1634
02:39:27,640 --> 02:39:29,500
Quiet, sit down.

1635
02:39:29,540 --> 02:39:31,720
I won't sit, I'm talking.
What are you going to do?

1636
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:33,730
You've already done it all.

1637
02:39:34,570 --> 02:39:36,600
You haven't shot me yet.
Go ahead.

1638
02:39:36,710 --> 02:39:39,580
Girls, he's here!

1639
02:39:40,520 --> 02:39:41,500
Mom!

1640
02:39:42,680 --> 02:39:44,580
I won't sit!

1641
02:39:44,620 --> 02:39:45,690
Sana!

1642
02:39:46,500 --> 02:39:48,620
I won't sit!

1643
02:39:48,700 --> 02:39:49,720
Mom!

1644
02:39:58,580 --> 02:39:59,620
Enough, let her go!

1645
02:40:02,640 --> 02:40:04,510
Sana, my love.

1646
02:40:04,550 --> 02:40:05,600
You're finally back.

1647
02:40:05,640 --> 02:40:07,630
Let her go. Get up, Mom!

1648
02:40:07,670 --> 02:40:08,700
Give him the gun.

1649
02:40:10,660 --> 02:40:12,580
Don't hurt my girls.

1650
02:40:12,620 --> 02:40:14,690
- You know to shoot, kid?
- Yes.

1651
02:40:16,610 --> 02:40:17,690
First, you have to pull this.

1652
02:40:18,530 --> 02:40:19,600
I know, it's armed.

1653
02:40:21,730 --> 02:40:23,580
Where have you learnt?

1654
02:40:23,620 --> 02:40:24,630
Stay back!

1655
02:40:24,670 --> 02:40:26,660
I'm a nervous wreck, I'll shoot.

1656
02:40:27,520 --> 02:40:28,660
Shoot your father?

1657
02:40:28,730 --> 02:40:29,700
Yes.

1658
02:40:30,590 --> 02:40:33,560
With what I've seen of you,
I'll definitely shoot.

1659
02:40:33,650 --> 02:40:34,690
Go ahead, honey.

1660
02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:38,570
Iman, if she gives it to you,

1661
02:40:38,610 --> 02:40:40,550
it will be all over, right?

1662
02:40:40,590 --> 02:40:41,610
It won't be over.

1663
02:40:41,650 --> 02:40:44,700
It's always been this way.
You've always given in.

1664
02:40:45,500 --> 02:40:46,620
You gave him everything.

1665
02:40:46,660 --> 02:40:48,700
If I give it back, nothing changes.

1666
02:40:49,500 --> 02:40:51,610
Please, Sana, sweetheart.

1667
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:53,520
Mom!

1668
02:40:55,590 --> 02:40:56,720
Rezvan, tell him to stay back!

1669
02:40:57,550 --> 02:40:58,570
Don't!

1670
02:43:19,570 --> 02:43:23,570
