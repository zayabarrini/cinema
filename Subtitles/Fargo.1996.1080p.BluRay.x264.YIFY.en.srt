1
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:17,866
<i>And keep your retirement</i>

2
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:23,538
<i>And your so-called
social security</i>

3
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:31,462
<i>Big city, turn me loose
and set me free...</i>

4
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,019
I'm Jerry Lundegaard.

5
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,354
You're Jerry Lundegaard?

6
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:49,480
Yeah.

7
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:50,815
Shep Proudfoot said...

8
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:54,068
Shep said
you'd be here at 7:30.
What gives, man?

9
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,904
Shep said 8:30.

10
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,214
We've been
sitting here an hour.

11
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,907
He's peed
three times already.

12
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,993
I'm sure sorry.
Shep told me 8:30.

13
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,203
It was a mix-up,
I guess.

14
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:05,580
You got the car?

15
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:06,915
Yeah. You bet.

16
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:09,584
It's out in the lot there,
brand-new,
burnt umber Cierra.

17
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:12,170
Yeah, okay.
Well, sit down, then.

18
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:14,088
I'm Carl Showalter.

19
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:16,382
This is my associate,
Gaear Grimsrud.

20
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:17,884
Yeah. How you doing?

21
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:20,428
So, we all set
on this thing, then?

22
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,311
Sure, Jerry.
We're all set.
Why wouldn't we be?

23
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:23,765
Yeah, no,
I'm sure you are.

24
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,183
Shep vouched
for you and all.

25
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,061
I got every confidence
here in you fellas.

26
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:35,068
I guess that's it, then.

27
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:36,152
Here are the keys.

28
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,570
No,
that's not it, Jerry.

29
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:38,696
Huh?

30
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,115
The new vehicle
plus $40,000.

31
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,785
Yeah, but the deal
was the car first,

32
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:47,163
then the 40,000,
like as if
it was the ransom.

33
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,331
I thought Shep told you.

34
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:49,958
Shep didn't
tell us much, Jerry.

35
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,125
<i>We'll, okay...</i>

36
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:53,378
Except that you
were gonna be here
at 7:30.

37
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,046
Yeah, well,
that was a mix-up, then.

38
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,631
Yeah, you already
said that.

39
00:04:56,714 --> 00:05:00,301
Yeah, but it's not
a whole
pay-in-advance deal.

40
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:04,514
See, I give you
a brand-new vehicle
in advance, and then...

41
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:06,140
I'm not gonna
debate you, Jerry.

42
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:07,225
Okay.

43
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,394
I'm not gonna sit here
and debate.

44
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:10,478
I will say
this, though.

45
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:13,272
What Shep told us
didn't make
a whole lot of sense.

46
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:16,401
Oh, no. It's real sound.
It's all worked out.

47
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:19,028
You want your own
wife kidnapped.

48
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:20,196
Yeah.

49
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,241
You...

50
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,201
My point is,

51
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:28,121
you pay the ransom,
what, 80,000 bucks?

52
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:32,041
I mean, you give us
half the ransom,
40,000, you keep half.

53
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,519
It's like robbing
Peter to pay Paul.

54
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:34,711
It doesn't
make any sense.

55
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:38,047
Okay, see, it's not
me paying the ransom.

56
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:41,009
The thing is,
my wife, she's wealthy.

57
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,802
Her dad,
he's real well-off.

58
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,220
Now, I'm in a bit
of trouble.

59
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,864
What kind of
trouble you in, Jerry?

60
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:49,642
Well, that's...
I'm not gonna get into...

61
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:51,144
See, I just need the money.

62
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,354
Now, her dad,
he's real well-off.

63
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,198
So, why don't you just
ask him for the money?

64
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,607
Or your fucking wife,
you know?

65
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:58,067
Or your
fucking wife, Jerry?

66
00:05:58,151 --> 00:05:59,402
Well...

67
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:02,238
It's all part of this...

68
00:06:04,157 --> 00:06:05,867
They don't know
I need it, see?

69
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,203
Okay, so there's that.
And even if they did,
I wouldn't get it,

70
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:10,788
so there's that
on top, then.

71
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:12,112
See, these are
personal matters.

72
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:13,207
Personal matters?

73
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,210
Yeah, personal matters
that needn't...

74
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:18,171
Okay, Jerry.

75
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:22,300
You're tasking us
to perform this mission,
but you won't...

76
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:23,843
You won't...

77
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,639
Fuck it.
Let's take a look
at that Cierra.

78
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:37,899
Hon?

79
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,651
Hi, hon!
Welcome back!

80
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:42,570
How was Fargo?

81
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,322
Yeah, real good.

82
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:46,032
Dad's here.

83
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:51,621
<i>...leads
the Badgers in goal production
with five this year.</i>

84
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:52,829
How you doing, Wade?

85
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:53,998
Yeah, pretty good.

86
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:55,083
What you
watching there?

87
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,209
Gophers.

88
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:57,627
Who they playing?

89
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,753
Ooh!

90
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,095
Is he staying
for supper, then?

91
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,930
Yeah. I think so.

92
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:10,598
- Dad?
- What?

93
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:11,974
Are you staying
for supper?

94
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,184
Yeah.

95
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:21,943
May I be
excused?

96
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,027
You done there?

97
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:24,529
Uh-huh.
I'm going out.

98
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,364
Where are you going?
Just out.

99
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:27,615
Just McDonald's.

100
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,367
Back at 9:30.
Okay.

101
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:32,203
He just ate.
He didn't finish.

102
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,872
Going to McDonald's
instead of finishing here.

103
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,457
He sees his friends there.
It's okay.

104
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,209
It's okay, McDonald's?

105
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,086
What do you think
they do there?

106
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,171
They don't drink
milk shakes,
I assure you.

107
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:43,756
It's okay, Dad.

108
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:53,182
Wade, have you had
a chance to think about

109
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:54,809
that deal I was
talking about,

110
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,561
those 40 acres there,
in Wayzata?

111
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,062
You told me about it.

112
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:00,022
Yeah, you said
you'd have to
think about it.

113
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:01,566
I understand.
It's a lot of money.

114
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,569
It's a heck of a lot.
What did you say
you were gonna put there?

115
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:05,945
A lot. It's a...

116
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,488
I know it's a lot.

117
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:08,698
I mean a parking lot.

118
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:11,826
Well, 750,000 is a lot.

119
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:13,775
Yeah, well,
it's a chunk, but...

120
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:16,831
I had a couple lots,
late 503.
Lost a lot of money.

121
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,594
A lot of money.
Yeah. but the difference...

122
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,835
I thought you were gonna
show it to Stan Grossman.

123
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,171
He passes on this stuff
before it gets
kicked up to me.

124
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,798
Well, Stan'll say, "No dice."
That's why you pay him.

125
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:27,884
I'm asking you here, Wade.

126
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:32,180
This could work out real good
for me and Jean and Scotty.

127
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,057
Jean and Scotty
never have to worry.

128
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:51,824
Where is Pancakes House?

129
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:54,118
What?

130
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:56,287
We stop at Pancakes House.

131
00:08:57,747 --> 00:09:00,082
What are you, nuts?
We had pancakes
for breakfast.

132
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,806
Gotta go to a place
where I can get a shot

133
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:03,419
and a beer
and a steak, maybe.

134
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,963
Not more fucking pancakes.
Come on.

135
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,970
Oh, come on, man.

136
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,307
Okay. Here's an idea.

137
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,059
We can stop
outside of Brainerd.

138
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:20,495
I know a place there
where we can get laid.
What do you think?

139
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,438
I'm fucking
hungry now, you know.

140
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:26,234
Yeah, yeah, Jesus.
I'm saying we can stop,
get pancakes,

141
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:28,736
and then we'll
get laid, all right?

142
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:38,996
<i>Lou Diamond, line one.</i>

143
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,084
We sat
right here in this room

144
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,585
and went over
this and over this.

145
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:45,753
Yeah, but that TruCoat...

146
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,756
I sat right here
and said I didn't
want any TruCoat.

147
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,800
Yeah, but I'm saying
that TruCoat.

148
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,927
You don't get it,
you get oxidation problems.

149
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,571
It'll cost you
a heck of a lot
more than $500.

150
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:55,680
You're sitting there.

151
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:56,764
You're talking
in circles.

152
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,784
You're talking like
we didn't go over
this already.

153
00:09:58,808 --> 00:09:59,892
Yeah, but this TruCoat...

154
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:02,103
We had a deal
here for 19,500.

155
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,956
You sat there and darned
if you didn't tell me

156
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,690
you'd get me this car,
these options,

157
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,650
without the sealant,
for 19,500.

158
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,235
All right,
I'm not saying I didn't.

159
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,861
You called me
20 minutes ago and said

160
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,613
you had it ready
to make delivery.

161
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,365
You says,
"Come on down
and get it."

162
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:18,577
And here you are,
and you're wasting
my time and my wife's time,

163
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:21,539
and I'm paying 19,500
for this vehicle here.

164
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,666
All right.

165
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,252
I'll talk to my boss.

166
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,757
See.
they Install that TruCoat
at the factory.

167
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:35,219
There's nothing we can do,
but I'll talk to my boss.

168
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,556
These guys here.
These guys.

169
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,476
It's always the same.
It's always more.

170
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,441
You going to
the Gophers on Sunday?

171
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:49,984
Oh, you betcha.

172
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,486
You wouldn't have
an extra ticket?

173
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,905
You kidding?

174
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:57,867
Well,

175
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,413
he never
done this before,

176
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:05,249
but seeing as
It's special circumstances
and all.

177
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,252
He says I can knock
$100 off that TruCoat.

178
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:11,380
100?

179
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:14,383
You lied to me,
Mr. Lundegaard.

180
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,260
You're a bald-faced liar.

181
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:17,970
Bucky, please.

182
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:20,639
A fucking liar.

183
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,224
Bucky, please.

184
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:24,852
Where's my
goddamn checkbook?

185
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,562
Let's get this
over with.

186
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:29,190
Where is it?

187
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:08,396
<i>From Hollywood,
The Tonight Show, starring...</i>

188
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:12,817
I am talking
about your potential.

189
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,901
Mmm-hmm.

190
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,612
You're not a C student.

191
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:17,988
Yeah.

192
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:20,449
Yet you're getting
C grades.

193
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:23,786
It's that disparity there
that concerns
your dad and me.

194
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:24,870
Uh-huh.

195
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:27,289
You know
what a disparity is?

196
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:28,416
Yeah!

197
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:30,626
Okay! Well,
that's why we...

198
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,045
We don't want you
going out for hockey.

199
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,422
Oh, man!

200
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,425
Come on.
What's the big deal?
It's just an hour...

201
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:38,300
Hold on.

202
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:39,635
What's the big deal?

203
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:40,803
Hello?

204
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,721
Yeah, hiya, hon.
Oh. hi.</i> Dad.

205
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:43,889
<i>Is Jerry around?</i>

206
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:45,850
Yeah. Hon!
Yeah, he's here.

207
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,143
Yeah, I'll catch him
for you.

208
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:48,394
- Hon!
- Yeah?

209
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,062
Okay.
It's Dad.

210
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:52,106
Look, Dad,
there's no fucking way...

211
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,189
Scotty!

212
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:55,609
Hey, let's watch
that language there.

213
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:56,819
How you doing there, Wade?

214
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,028
<i>What's going on there?</i>

215
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:00,448
Nothing, Wade.
How you doing there?

216
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:02,616
<i>Stan Grossman
looked at your proposal.</i>

217
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,951
<i>He says
it's pretty sweet.</i>

218
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,077
No kidding?

219
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,370
<i>Might be interested.</i>

220
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:10,791
No kidding?
I'd need the cash
pretty quick there,

221
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,334
in order to
close the deal.

222
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:14,086
Come <i>by at 2:30.
We 'll talk about it.</i>

223
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,214
<i>If your numbers
are right, Stan says
it's pretty sweet.</i>

224
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:19,133
<i>Stan. you know. Grossman.
Yeah.</i>

225
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,217
<i>2:30.</i>

226
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,385
Yeah. Okay.

227
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,068
Say, Shep,
how you doing there?

228
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,029
Say, you know
those two fellas

229
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,822
you put me
in touch with
up there in Fargo?

230
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:43,532
I put you in
touch with Grimsrud.

231
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:45,326
Yeah, well, he had
a buddy there.

232
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:46,619
Then I don't vouch for him.

233
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:47,786
Well, that's okay.

234
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,039
I vouch for Grimsrud.
Who's his buddy?

235
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:51,707
Carl something.

236
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,310
Never heard of him.
Don't vouch for him.

237
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:56,295
Well, that's okay.
He's a buddy of
the guy you vouched for,

238
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:57,796
so I'm not worried.
I just...

239
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,299
I was wondering,
see, I got to get
in touch with him.

240
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:04,303
See, this deal I needed
him for, I may not
need it anymore.

241
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,347
Something's happening. see.
Call him up.

242
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,850
Yeah, well, see, I did that,
and I haven't
been able to get him,

243
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:13,103
so I thought maybe you'd
know an alternate number,
or what have you.

244
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:14,188
Nope.

245
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,065
Okay. Well...

246
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:17,691
Real good, then.

247
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:40,381
Can you crack
a fucking
window open, man?

248
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:46,220
You know, it's proven
that secondhand smoke is...

249
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,305
You know, a cancer agent.

250
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:52,226
Hey, look at that.
Twin Cities.

251
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,954
That's the IDS Building,
the big glass one.

252
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:59,024
Tallest skyscraper
in the Midwest after
the Sears in Chicago,

253
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:01,735
or John Hancock building,
whatever.

254
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:04,363
You ever been
to Minneapolis?

255
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:05,531
No.

256
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,661
Would it kill you
to say something?

257
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:12,496
I did.

258
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:16,917
"No." That's the first thing
you've said in
the last four hours.

259
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:18,752
That's a...

260
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,422
That's a fountain
of conversation, man.

261
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,173
That's a geyser.

262
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:26,010
I mean, whoa, daddy.
Stand back, man.

263
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:28,971
Shit.

264
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,806
I'm sitting here driving.

265
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,266
I'm doing
all the driving, man,

266
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,101
whole fucking way
from Brainerd, driving.

267
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,854
Just trying to chat.

268
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:39,565
You know,
keep our spirits up,

269
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:40,792
fight the boredom
of the road,

270
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:44,987
and you can't say
one fucking thing just
in the way of conversation?

271
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:49,116
Oh, fuck it. I don't
have to talk either, man.

272
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,993
See how you like it.

273
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,790
Just total fucking silence.

274
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:59,251
Two could play at
that game, smart guy.

275
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:01,587
We'll just see
how you like it.

276
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,674
Total silence.

277
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:11,305
<i>Mr. Lundegaard,
this is Reilly
Diefenbach from GMAC.</i>

278
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,556
<i>How are you this morning?</i>

279
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,932
Real good.
How you doing?

280
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,434
<i>Pretty good,
Mr. Lundegaard.</i>

281
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,519
<i>You're damn hard
to get on the phone.</i>

282
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:20,064
It's pretty darn busy here,
but that's
the way we like it.

283
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:21,148
<i>Well, that's for sure.</i>

284
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,150
<i>Now, I just need
on these last,</i>

285
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,319
<i>these financing documents
that you sent us,</i>

286
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,529
<i>I can't read
the serial numbers
of the vehicles.</i>

287
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:28,947
Yeah, but I already
got the...

288
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,449
It's okay.
The loans are in place.

289
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,284
I already got the...
What? The...

290
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:33,619
<i>Yeah, the 320,000.</i>

291
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,162
<i>You got the money
last month.</i>

292
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,622
Yeah, so we're all
set, then.

293
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,916
<i>Yeah. but the vehicles
that you're
borrowing on.</i>

294
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,919
<i>[just can't read
the serial numbers
on your application.</i>

295
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,202
<i>Maybe if you
could just read...</i>

296
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,356
Yeah, but the deal's
already done.

297
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,506
I already got the money.

298
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:47,007
<i>Yes, but if we have
an audit here,</i>

299
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:48,568
<i>[just have to know
that these vehicles</i>

300
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:49,885
<i>you're financing
with this money,</i>

301
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,303
<i>that they really exist.</i>

302
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:53,597
Yeah, well,
they exist, all right.

303
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:55,349
<i>I'm sure they do,</i>

304
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:58,811
<i>but I can't read
the serial numbers here,
so if you could read me...</i>

305
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:01,855
Yeah, but... See...

306
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,719
I don't have
them in front of me.

307
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:05,275
Why don't I just
fax you over a copy?

308
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,944
<i>No, well, no,
fax is no good.</i>

309
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,029
<i>That's what I have,
and I can't read
the darn thing.</i>

310
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:11,865
Yeah, okay. I'll have my girl
send you a copy, then.

311
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:15,244
<i>Okay, because if
I can't correlate this note
with the specific vehicles,</i>

312
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,371
<i>then I got to
call back that money.</i>

313
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,872
Yeah, how much
money was that?

314
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:21,875
<i>320,000.
I got to correlate
that money</i>

315
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,377
<i>with the cars
it's being lent on.</i>

316
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,587
Yeah. Okay. no problem.
I'll just fax
that right over.

317
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:26,672
<i>No, no, no. Fax...</i>

318
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,608
I mean, send it over.
I'll shoot it
right over to you, then.

319
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:29,717
<i>Okay, okay. Fine.</i>

320
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,677
Okay. Real good, then.

321
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,060
<i>We're back with Katie Carlson.
Hi.</i>

322
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:41,246
<i>Now, before
we get going here,</i>

<i>It's a terrific time.
I know
you've heard about it.</i>

328

<i>We want all of you
to come with,</i>

329
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,411
<i>and that's the truth.</i>

330
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,081
<i>Okay, now,

331
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:02,684
<i>Katie here, this morning,

333

<i>What?
Now. Katie. I gotta admit...</i>

334
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,299
<i>I was a little bit surprised
when I first picked this up.</i>

335
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:11,383
<i>Right.</i>

336
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:12,468
<i>This is an empty egg.</i>

337
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:13,761
<i>That's right, Dale.</i>

338
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:14,904
<i>Well, how do you
get the egg...</i>

339
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,239
<i>Yeah.
Theme was an egg
in here. right?</i>

340
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:19,099
<i>Okay, well, I don't...
How do you...
I mean, you don't have</i>

341
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:22,102
<i>an empty chicken somewhere
that lays empty eggs?</i>

342
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:23,228
<i>No, no.</i>

343
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:25,898
<i>I guarantee, this was
an honest-to-goodness...</i>

344
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,206
Unguent

345
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,290
What?

346
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,083
I need unguent.

347
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:52,716
No.

348
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:01,850
No...

349
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:26,291
You want to do it?

350
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,584
Push.

351
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,646
How are you, Stan?
How you doing, Wade?

352
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,648
Good to see you
again, Jerry.

353
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:34,318
If these numbers
are right,
this looks pretty sweet.

354
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,777
Those numbers
are right, all right.

355
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:36,904
Believe me.

356
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:38,155
This is doable.

357
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,448
Congratulations, Jer.

358
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,408
Yeah, thanks, Stan.
Well, it's a pretty...

359
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:44,620
What kind of finder's fee
were you looking for?

360
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,455
Huh?

361
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:49,249
The financials
are pretty thorough,

362
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,210
so the only thing
we don't know is your fee.

363
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:53,670
My fee?

364
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:56,340
Wade, what the heck
are you talking about?

365
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,758
Stan and I are okay.

366
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,718
Yeah.
We're good to load In.

367
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,219
Yeah.

368
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:04,932
But we never talked
about your fee
for bringing it to us.

369
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,351
No, but, Wade, see,
I was bringing you
this deal

370
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,870
for you to loan me
the money to put in.

371
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,812
It's my deal here, see.

372
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,108
Jerry, we thought
you were bringing us
an investment.

373
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,443
Yeah. Right.

374
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,362
You're saying...

375
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,072
What are you saying?

376
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,466
You're saying
we put in all the money,

377
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,908
and you collect
when it pays off.

378
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,454
No, no. See... But I'd...

379
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:30,165
I'd pay you back
the principal
and interest.

380
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,960
Heck, I'd go
one over prime?

381
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,461
We're not a bank, Jerry.

382
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,588
If I wanted bank
interest on 750,000,

383
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:39,633
I'd go to Midwest Federal,
talk to old Bill Diehl.

384
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,093
He's at North Star.
He's at...

385
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,136
No, no. See, Lu

386
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:47,015
I don't need a finder's fee.
I need...

387
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,643
Finder's fee is,
what, 10%?

388
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,144
Heck, that's not
gonna do it for me.

389
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:52,354
I need the principal.

390
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:55,691
Well, Jerry, we're not gonna
just give you $750,000.

391
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,234
What the heck
were you thinking?

392
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,637
If I'm only
getting bank interest,

393
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:01,488
I want complete security.
Heck, FDIC.

394
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:02,990
I don't see nothing
like that here.

395
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,616
Yeah, but I...

396
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,704
Okay. I...

397
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:10,539
I guarantee you
your money back.

398
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,834
I'm not talking about
your damn word, Jerry.

399
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,168
Jeez!
What the heck are you...

400
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:16,920
We're not a bank, Jerry.

401
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,007
Well, look.
I don't want to cut you
out of the loop,

402
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,426
but this here's
a good deal.

403
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,845
I assume,
if you're not interested,

404
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:28,348
you won't mind
if we move on it
independenfly.

405
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:30,577
Damn it!

406
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,026
Hon?

407
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:07,531
I got the groceries!

408
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:47,445
Yeah, Wade, hi.
It's Jerry. I...

409
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:53,493
Wade, it's Jerry.
I don't know what to do.
It's Jean.

410
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:56,163
I don't know what to do.
It's my wife.

411
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,748
I don't know what to do.
It's Jean.

412
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,920
Yeah, Wade, I...
It's Jerry. I...

413
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,758
Wade, it's Jerry.
I... We gotta talk.

414
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,761
It's something...
Jeez. It's terrible.

415
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:24,232
Yeah, Wade Gustafson, please.

416
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,187
Shut the fuck up,

417
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,898
or I'll throw you
back into the trunk,
you know.

418
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:08,235
Jesus, that's more than
I've heard you say all week.

419
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,827
Shit.

420
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,665
Oh, the tags.

421
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:29,422
All right,
it's just the tags.

422
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:31,758
I never put
my tags on the car.

423
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:36,805
All right, don't worry.
I'll take care of this.

424
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,098
All right, just keep it
still back there, lady,

425
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:05,542
or else we're gonna
have to, you know,
to shoot you.

426
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,885
Hey, I'll take care of this.

427
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,328
How can I help you, Officer?

428
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:52,797
This is a new car,
then, sir?

429
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:55,884
It certainly is, Officer.
Still got that smell.

430
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,429
You're required
to display
temporary tags,

431
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:02,140
either in the plate area
or taped to the inside
of the back window.

432
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,266
Certainly.

433
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,685
Can I see your license
and registration, please?

434
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,145
Certainly.

435
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:13,068
Yeah, I was gonna
tape up those...
The tag.

436
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:17,739
You know,
to be in full compliance,
but it must have...

437
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,949
It must have
slipped my mind.

438
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:22,720
So maybe the best
thing to do would be

439
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:25,163
to take care of that
right here in Brainerd.

440
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:28,416
What's this, sir?

441
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,294
My license
and registration.

442
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:34,756
Yeah, I want to be
in compliance.

443
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:39,302
I was just thinking
we could take care
of it right here,

444
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:40,804
in Brainerd.

445
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:49,854
Put that back in
your pocket, please,

446
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:52,482
and step out
of the car,
please, sir.

447
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:18,174
Shut the fuck up.

448
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:36,818
Whoa.

449
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,155
Whoa, daddy.

450
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,118
You'll take care of it.

451
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:51,374
You are smooth,
smooth, you know?

452
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:54,836
Oh, daddy.

453
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,840
Just clear him
off the road.

454
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:00,884
Yeah.

455
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,124
No!

456
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,783
Oh, jeez.

457
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:01,165
Hi. It's Marge.

458
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:04,627
Oh, my. Where?

459
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:06,796
Yeah?

460
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,465
Oh, jeez.

461
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:13,553
Okay. There in a jiff.

462
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:15,638
Real good, then.

463
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,482
You can sleep.
It's early yet.

464
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:28,025
Got to go?

465
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:29,277
Yeah.

466
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,071
I'll fix you
some eggs.

467
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,699
It's okay, hon.
I gotta run.

468
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,243
You got to eat
a breakfast, Marge.

469
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:41,038
I'll fix you
some eggs.

470
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,000
Hon, you can sleep.

471
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:46,461
You gotta
eat a breakfast.

472
00:34:49,964 --> 00:34:51,841
I'll fix you
some eggs.

473
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:54,177
Norm.

474
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:03,227
Thanks, hon.
Time to shove off.

475
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:05,021
Love you, Margie.

476
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:06,355
Love you, hon.

477
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:40,555
Hon?

478
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:41,599
Yeah?

479
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,476
Prowler needs a jump.

480
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:04,580
Hiya, Lou.

481
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:08,084
What you got there?

482
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:11,254
Margie, thought
you might need
a little warm-up.

483
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:13,047
Thanks a bunch.

484
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,423
So what's
the deal now?

485
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:15,716
Gary says
triple homicide?

486
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,093
Yeah, looks pretty bad.

487
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:18,761
Two of them
are over here.

488
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,763
Where is everybody?

489
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:23,641
Well, it's cold, Margie.

490
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:27,937
Watch your step, Margie.

491
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:39,699
Jeez.Sou.

492
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:41,993
Jeez!

493
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:43,953
Here's the second one!

494
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:47,790
It's in the head
and the hand there.

495
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,127
I guess that's
a defensive wound.

496
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,795
Oh, yeah?

497
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:55,882
Where's the
state trooper?

498
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:59,635
Back there a good piece,
in the ditch
next to his prowler.

499
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:01,137
Okay.

500
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:04,599
So we got a trooper
pulls someone over.

501
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:06,142
We got a shooting.

502
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:07,602
These folks drive by.

503
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:10,313
There's
a high-speed pursuit.
ends here.

504
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,607
And then this
execution-type deal.

505
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,816
Yeah.

506
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:18,321
I'd be very surprised
if our suspect
was from Brainerd.

507
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:19,572
Yeah.

508
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:22,950
And I'll tell you what.

509
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:26,162
From his footprint,
he looks like
a big fella.

510
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:32,209
You see something
down there, Chief?

511
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:35,087
No. I just think
I'm gonna barf.

512
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:36,297
Jeez.

513
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,841
You okay, Margie?

514
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:40,509
Yeah. I'm fine.

515
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:45,097
It's just
morning sickness.

516
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:49,101
Well, that passed.

517
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:50,269
Yeah?

518
00:37:50,353 --> 00:37:51,979
Yeah. Now
I'm hungry again.

519
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:54,649
You have breakfast
yet, Margie?

520
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:56,192
Oh, yeah.

521
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:57,777
Norm made some eggs.

522
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,028
Yeah?

523
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:01,030
Well...

524
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:04,200
What now, do you think?

525
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,369
Let's go take
a look at that trooper.

526
00:38:09,747 --> 00:38:11,290
There's different
footprints here, Lou.

527
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:12,416
Yeah?

528
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,127
Yeah. This guy's
smaller than his buddy.

529
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:16,504
Oh, yeah?

530
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:18,965
For Pete's sake.

531
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:20,466
How's it look, Marge?

532
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:23,552
Well, he's got
his gun
on his hip there,

533
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:26,472
and he looks like
a nice enough guy.

534
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,516
It's a real shame.

535
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:29,934
Yeah.

536
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:34,438
Didn't monkey
with his car there,
did you?

537
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:35,606
No way.

538
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,316
Well, somebody
shut his lights.

539
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,818
I guess the little guy
sat in there

540
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:40,236
waiting for
his buddy
to come back.

541
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,904
Yeah, it would have
been cold out here.

542
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:44,907
Heck, yeah.
You think is Dave
open yet?

543
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,117
Dave?

544
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:48,661
You don't think
he's mixed up in...

545
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:52,081
Oh, no, no. I just
want to get Norm
some night crawlers.

546
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,794
Did you look
in his citation book?

547
00:38:56,877 --> 00:39:02,091
Yeah. Last vehicle
he wrote in was
a tan Cierra at 2:18 am.

548
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,385
Under plate
number he put "DLR."

549
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:06,137
I figure they stopped him
or shot him

550
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,265
before he could finish
filling out the tag number.

551
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:12,852
So, I got the State
looking for a Cierra
with a tag starting "DLR."

552
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:15,021
They don't got
no match yet.

553
00:39:16,022 --> 00:39:18,065
I'm not sure that
I agree with you 100%

554
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:20,192
on your police
work there, Lou.

555
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,610
Yeah?
Yeah.

556
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:25,448
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates.

557
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:27,283
"DLR."

558
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:30,619
Oh.

559
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,789
Jeez.

560
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:36,751
Say, Lou,

561
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:37,978
did you hear
the one about the guy

562
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:39,562
who couldn't afford
personalized plates,

563
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:42,965
So he went and changed
his name to J3L-2404?

564
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,010
Yeah. That's a good one.

565
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:57,188
Look, all's I know is,
you got a problem,
you call a professional.

566
00:39:57,271 --> 00:39:59,065
No. They said no cops.

567
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:00,900
They were darn
clear on that, Wade.

568
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:03,003
They said,
"You call your cops,
and we're gonna shoot..."

569
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:04,445
Of course
they're gonna
say that

570
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:06,572
Where's my protection?
They got Jean here.

571
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,574
If I give these
sons of bitches
$1 million,

572
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,451
where's my guarantee
they're gonna
let her go?

573
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:11,535
Well, they...

574
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:12,763
$1 million
is a lot of
damn money.

575
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:14,556
Yeah. but...
There they are.
They got my daughter.

576
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,082
Think this thing
through here, Wade.

577
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:19,085
You give them what they want,
why won't they let her go?

578
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:22,046
You got to
listen to me
on this one, Wade.

579
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:23,923
Heck, you don't know.

580
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:26,008
You're just whistling
Dixie here.

581
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:28,094
I'm saying the cops,
they can
advise us on this.

582
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:29,428
I'm saying
call a professional.

583
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:31,472
No. No cops.

584
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:34,975
That's final.
This is my deal
here, Wade.

585
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:36,102
Yeah.

586
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:38,145
Jean is my wife here.

587
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:41,107
I gotta tell you, Wade,
I'm leaning to
Jerry's viewpoint here.

588
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,191
Well...

589
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:44,443
We got to
protect Jean.
These”.

590
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:46,278
We're not holding
any cards here, Wade.

591
00:40:46,362 --> 00:40:48,322
They got them all.
So they call the shots.

592
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:49,532
You're darn tooting.

593
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:50,699
Oh, damn it.

594
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:51,951
I'm telling you.

595
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:54,411
Well, why don't we...

596
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:58,082
Stan, I'm thinking
we should offer them
a half a million.

597
00:40:58,165 --> 00:40:59,583
Now, come on here!

598
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:01,627
No way, Wade.
No way.

599
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,087
We're not
horse-trading
here, Wade.

600
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,171
Yeah.

601
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:05,965
We gotta just
bite the bullet
on this thing.

602
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,174
Yeah.

603
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:11,846
So, well,
what's the next step
here, Jerry?

604
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:14,557
They're gonna call me up
and give me
instructions for a drop.

605
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,284
I'm supposed to
have the money
ready tomorrow.

606
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:17,476
Damn it!

607
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:21,772
How was everything today?

608
00:41:21,856 --> 00:41:23,649
Yeah. Real good, now.

609
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:26,986
How you doing?

610
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:30,906
Okay.
Now, we'll get
the money together.

611
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,117
Don't worry
about it, Jerry.

612
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,121
Now, do you want anyone
at home with you
till they call?

613
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:38,664
No. I...
They don't...

614
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:40,541
They were just
supposed to be
dealing with me.

615
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:41,834
They were real clear.
Yeah.

616
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:44,086
You know, they said
no one listening in.

617
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,337
They'll be watching.

618
00:41:45,421 --> 00:41:47,381
You know,
maybe it's all bull,

619
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:50,009
but like you said, Stan,
they're calling the shots.

620
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:51,260
Okay.

621
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,305
Now, is Scotty
gonna be all right?

622
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,100
Yeah. Jeez. Scotty.

623
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:00,477
Yeah. I'll go
talk to him.

624
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:18,287
How you doing
there, Scotty?

625
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:19,955
Dad...

626
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:22,666
What are they doing?

627
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:25,169
What do you think
they're doing with Mom?

628
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:26,921
It's okay, Scotty.

629
00:42:27,046 --> 00:42:28,714
They're not gonna
wanna hurt her any.

630
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:31,467
These men,
they just want money.

631
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:34,303
Yeah, well,
what if something
goes wrong, Dad?

632
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:37,973
No, no.
Nothing's going
wrong here.

633
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:42,269
Granddad and I,
we're, we're making sure
this gets handled right.

634
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:45,356
I really think
we should
call the cops here.

635
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:48,692
No. No. No one can
know about this thing.

636
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:51,070
We gotta play
ball with these guys.

637
00:42:51,153 --> 00:42:53,239
You ask Stan Grossman,
he'll tell you
the same thing.

638
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:54,323
Yeah. But, Dad...

639
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:57,868
We're gonna get
Mom back for you,
but we gotta play ball.

640
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,411
You know?

641
00:43:00,955 --> 00:43:02,831
That's the deal here.

642
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:09,755
So if Lorraine calls,
or Sylvia,

643
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:13,342
you just say
Mom's down in Florida,
with Pearl and Marty.

644
00:43:17,388 --> 00:43:19,682
That's the best
we can do here.

645
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:04,727
No!

646
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:22,911
No!

647
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:30,085
Oh, God.

648
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:47,186
Lunchtime.

649
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:48,479
Thanks,
Margaret.

650
00:44:48,562 --> 00:44:50,272
Hi. Hey.

651
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:52,399
Willy. Carol.

652
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:55,069
Janie, two more of those
Skin 80 Soft, please.

653
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:56,195
Sure thing.

654
00:44:57,654 --> 00:44:59,114
Hiya, hon.

655
00:44:59,198 --> 00:45:00,949
I brought you
some lunch, Margie.

656
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:03,303
What are those?
Night crawlers?

657
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:04,453
Yeah.

658
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:05,788
Oh, thanks, hon.

659
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:07,915
You bet.
Thanks for lunch.

660
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:10,167
Yeah.
Looks pretty good.

661
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:13,128
<i>What do we
got here, Amy's?</i>

662
00:45:13,212 --> 00:45:14,713
How's the painting going?

663
00:45:14,797 --> 00:45:16,256
Pretty good.

664
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:19,718
Found out the Hautmans
are entering
a painting this year.

665
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:21,887
Hon, you're better
than them.

666
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,889
They're real good.

667
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:27,059
They're good, Norm,
but you're
better than them.

668
00:45:28,018 --> 00:45:29,478
You think so?

669
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:33,399
Hey, you got Arby's
all over me.

670
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:37,861
Hiya, Norm.
How's the painting going?

671
00:45:37,945 --> 00:45:39,488
Not too bad.
You know.

672
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:40,864
How we doing
on that vehicle?

673
00:45:40,948 --> 00:45:43,575
Well, no motels registered
any tan Cierra last night,

674
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:47,079
but the night before,
two men checked
into the Blue Ox,

675
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:50,290
registering a Cierra
and leaving
the tag space blank.

676
00:45:50,374 --> 00:45:51,542
Jeez, that's
a good lead.

677
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:52,709
Yeah.

678
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:55,254
Blue Ox, that's
that truckers' joint
out there on I-35?

679
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:57,965
Yeah. Owner was
on the desk then.

680
00:45:58,048 --> 00:45:59,967
Said these two
had company.

681
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,176
Oh, yeah?

682
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:02,428
Yeah.

683
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:08,600
Yeah, we both did.
She went to college, too.

684
00:46:08,684 --> 00:46:10,662
I went to
Normandale for about
a year and a half.

685
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:11,770
Yeah, that's where
we met.

686
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:12,938
But I dropped out,
though.

687
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:14,106
Yeah.
She dropped.

688
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:15,190
Yeah.

689
00:46:15,524 --> 00:46:16,984
So where you girls from?

690
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:18,944
Chaska.
Le Sueur.

691
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:21,155
But I went to high school
in White Bear Lake.

692
00:46:21,238 --> 00:46:22,531
Go Bears.

693
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:27,035
Okay. I want you to
tell me what these
fellows looked like.

694
00:46:27,286 --> 00:46:29,222
Well, the little guy,
he was kind of
funny-looking.

695
00:46:29,246 --> 00:46:30,289
In what way?

696
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:32,291
I don't know.
Just funny-looking.

697
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:34,710
Can you be
any more specific?

698
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:36,128
I couldn't really say.

699
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:37,671
He wasn't circumcised.

700
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:41,592
Was he funny-looking
apart from that?

701
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:42,801
Yeah.

702
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:47,598
So, you were having sex
with the little fella, then.

703
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:49,141
Uh-huh.

704
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:51,268
Is there anything else
you can tell me about him?

705
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:54,188
No. Like I say,
he was funny-looking.

706
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:56,315
More than
most people, even.

707
00:46:56,398 --> 00:46:57,608
What about
the other fella?

708
00:46:57,691 --> 00:46:58,817
He was a little older.

709
00:46:58,901 --> 00:47:00,652
You know,
he looked like
the Marlboro Man.

710
00:47:00,736 --> 00:47:02,404
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

711
00:47:02,488 --> 00:47:03,947
But maybe I'm saying
that, you know,

712
00:47:04,031 --> 00:47:06,325
'cause he smoked
a lot of Marlboros.

713
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:08,243
You know,
like a subconscious
type of thing.

714
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:09,495
Oh, yeah,
that can happen.

715
00:47:09,578 --> 00:47:10,621
Yeah.

716
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:12,706
Hey, they said
they were going to
the Twin Cities.

717
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:14,291
Oh. yeah?
Yeah!

718
00:47:14,374 --> 00:47:15,834
Yeah, is that
useful to you?

719
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:17,503
You betcha. Yeah.

720
00:47:17,586 --> 00:47:18,921
Yeah
Yeah.

721
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:22,257
Come on!

722
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:24,718
Goddamn it!

723
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,680
Jesus Christ.

724
00:47:30,557 --> 00:47:32,142
Fucking shitbox.

725
00:47:33,602 --> 00:47:35,354
Been here for days.

726
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:38,565
Damn it.
Nothing to do.

727
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:41,902
Fucking TV
doesn't even...

728
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:47,616
Damn it, come on!
Plug me in, man.
Give me a fucking signal.

729
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:51,119
Goddamn it!

730
00:47:53,622 --> 00:47:55,582
Unbelievable! Come on!

731
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:57,125
God...

732
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,086
Fuck!

733
00:47:59,169 --> 00:48:02,464
Come on, plug me into
the ozone, baby! Come on!

734
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:05,300
Come on!

735
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:08,845
Fuck! Fuck!

736
00:48:09,972 --> 00:48:11,473
Fuck! Fuck!

737
00:48:18,105 --> 00:48:21,650
<i>The bark beetle
carries the worm to its nest</i>

738
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:25,988
<i>where it will feed its young
for up to six months.</i>

739
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:31,952
<i>In the spring,
the larvae hatch,
and the cycle begins again.</i>

740
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:33,328
Well...

741
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:36,498
I'm turning in, Norm.

742
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:38,333
Oh, yeah?

743
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:43,547
<i>Here it is, throwing
off the larval envelope.</i>

744
00:48:57,644 --> 00:48:58,687
Hello?

745
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,772
<i>Yeah.
Is this Marge?</i>

746
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:02,107
Yeah.

747
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:03,817
<i>Margie Olmstead?</i>

748
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,029
Yeah. Who's this?

749
00:49:07,112 --> 00:49:09,323
<i>This is Mike Yanagita!</i>

750
00:49:09,406 --> 00:49:12,034
<i>You know, Mike Yanagita.
Remember me?</i>

751
00:49:14,453 --> 00:49:15,954
Mike Yanagita?

752
00:49:16,038 --> 00:49:17,456
<i>Yeah!</i>

753
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,167
Well, yeah!

754
00:49:20,834 --> 00:49:22,461
Course I remember you.

755
00:49:22,544 --> 00:49:24,963
How are you doing?
What time is it?

756
00:49:25,047 --> 00:49:27,466
<i>Oh, jeez.
It's 10:45.</i>

757
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:28,967
<i>I hope
I didn't wake you.</i>

758
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:31,803
No. That's okay.

759
00:49:31,887 --> 00:49:33,972
<i>Yeah, I'm down in
the Twin Cities,</i>

760
00:49:34,056 --> 00:49:36,933
<i>and I was just watching
on TV about these
shootings up in Brainerd.</i>

761
00:49:37,017 --> 00:49:38,477
<i>And I saw you
on the news there.</i>

762
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,645
Yeah.

763
00:49:39,728 --> 00:49:41,331
<i>I thought,
"Jeez, is that
Margie Olmstead?"</i>

764
00:49:41,355 --> 00:49:42,481
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

765
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:44,900
Yeah, that's me.

766
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:47,319
<i>Well, how the heck
are you?</i>

767
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:49,029
Okay. You know.

768
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:50,906
Okay.

769
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:52,449
<i>Yeah?</i>
Yeah.

770
00:49:53,075 --> 00:49:54,534
How you doing?

771
00:49:54,618 --> 00:49:56,244
<i>Pretty good.</i>

772
00:49:57,245 --> 00:49:58,914
Well, heck.

773
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:01,333
It's been such
a longtime, Mike.

774
00:50:02,084 --> 00:50:04,211
It's great to
hear from you.

775
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:09,424
Yeah, you got your...

776
00:50:09,508 --> 00:50:12,552
This is loaded here.
This has
your independent...

777
00:50:12,636 --> 00:50:16,014
Your front-wheel drive,
rack-and-pinion steering,

778
00:50:16,098 --> 00:50:19,017
antilock brakes,
alarm, radar,

779
00:50:19,476 --> 00:50:22,062
and I can give it to you
with a heck of a sealant.

780
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:24,439
This TruCoat stuff,
it'll keep the salt off.

781
00:50:24,523 --> 00:50:26,358
Yeah, I don't need
no sealant, though.

782
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,276
Yeah.
You don't need that.

783
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,112
Now, were you thinking
of financing here?

784
00:50:30,195 --> 00:50:32,823
You ought to be aware
of this GMAC plan
they have now.

785
00:50:32,906 --> 00:50:33,907
It's really super.

786
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,200
Got a call
for you, Jerry.

787
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:36,618
Yeah, okay.

788
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,710
Jerry Lundegaard.

789
00:50:44,793 --> 00:50:46,962
<i>All right, Jerry,
you got the phone
to yourself?</i>

790
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:48,130
Well, yeah.

791
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:49,214
<i>You know who this is?</i>

792
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:51,299
Well, yeah,
I got an idea.

793
00:50:51,383 --> 00:50:53,218
How's that Cierra
working out for you?

794
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:55,554
<i>Circumstances
have changed, Jerry.</i>

795
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:56,805
Well...

796
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:58,682
What do you mean?

797
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:02,477
<i>Things have changed.
Circumstances, Jerry,
beyond the acts of God.</i>

798
00:51:02,561 --> 00:51:03,603
Force majeure.

799
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:04,938
What the...

800
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:06,398
How's Jean?

801
00:51:07,816 --> 00:51:08,859
<i>Who's Jean?</i>

802
00:51:08,942 --> 00:51:10,902
My wife. What the...

803
00:51:10,986 --> 00:51:13,089
<i>She's all right,
but there's three people
up in Brainerd</i>

804
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:14,382
<i>who aren't so okay,
I'll tell you that.</i>

805
00:51:14,406 --> 00:51:15,633
What the heck
are you talking about?

806
00:51:15,657 --> 00:51:17,242
Let's just finish
this deal up here.

807
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:19,494
<i>Blood has been
shed, Jerry.</i>

808
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:21,288
What the heck
do you mean?

809
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:23,248
<i>Three people
in Brainerd.</i>

810
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:24,416
Oh, jeez.

811
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:26,543
<i>That's right,
and we need
more money.</i>

812
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:27,895
What the heck
are you talking about?

813
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:29,838
What do you fellas
got yourself mixed up in?

814
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:30,922
<i>We need more money...</i>

815
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:33,091
This was supposed to be
a no-rough-stuff type deal.

816
00:51:33,175 --> 00:51:35,761
<i>Don't ever
interrupt me, Jerry!
Just shut the fuck up!</i>

817
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:37,971
Well, I'm sorry,
but I just, I...

818
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:40,223
<i>I'm not gonna
debate you, Jerry.
I'm not gonna debate!</i>

819
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:41,808
<i>We now want
the entire 80,000.</i>

820
00:51:41,892 --> 00:51:43,769
Oh, for Christ's sake here.

821
00:51:43,852 --> 00:51:45,103
<i>Blood has been shed.</i>

822
00:51:45,187 --> 00:51:46,438
<i>We've incurred
risk, Jerry.</i>

823
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:47,681
<i>I'm coming into
town tomorrow.</i>

824
00:51:47,731 --> 00:51:48,857
<i>You have
the money ready.</i>

825
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,318
Now, we had a deal here.
A deal's a deal.

826
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:52,444
<i>Is it, Jerry?</i>

827
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:54,797
<i>You ask those three
poor souls up in Brainerd
if a deal's a deal.</i>

828
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:55,947
<i>Go ahead, ask them!</i>

829
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,073
The heck do you mean?

830
00:51:57,157 --> 00:51:59,534
<i>"The heck do you mean?"
I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

831
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:04,830
Yeah?

832
00:52:04,873 --> 00:52:05,957
<i>Jerome Lundegaard?</i>

833
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:07,083
Yeah.

834
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:08,794
<i>This is Reilly Diefenbach
at GMAC.</i>

835
00:52:08,877 --> 00:52:11,630
<i>Sir, I've not received
those vehicle IDs
you promised.</i>

836
00:52:11,713 --> 00:52:13,048
Yeah. I...

837
00:52:13,507 --> 00:52:14,758
Those are in the mail.

838
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:17,594
<i>That very well may be.
I must inform you,
however,</i>

839
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:20,472
<i>that absent the receipt
of those numbers
by tomorrow afternoon,</i>

840
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:23,058
<i>I will have to refer
this matter to
our legal department.</i>

841
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:24,142
Yeah.

842
00:52:24,226 --> 00:52:25,977
<i>My patience is at an end.</i>
Yeah.

843
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:27,562
Good <i>day, sir.</i>
Yeah.

844
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,915
Hi, Norm.
How you doing, Margie?

845
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:31,001
How's the fricassee?

846
00:53:31,084 --> 00:53:32,544
Pretty darn good.
You want some?

847
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:33,879
Oh, no. I got...

848
00:53:33,962 --> 00:53:37,924
Hey, Norm, I thought
you was going ice fishing
up at Mille Lacs.

849
00:53:38,592 --> 00:53:40,302
Yeah. After lunch.

850
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,053
What you got there?

851
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:44,556
The numbers
you asked for.

852
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:47,350
Calls made from
the lobby pay phone
at the Blue Ox.

853
00:53:47,434 --> 00:53:49,477
Two to Minneapolis
that night.

854
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:50,896
First one's
a trucking company

855
00:53:50,979 --> 00:53:52,856
and second one's
a private residence,

856
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:54,608
a Shep Proudfoot.

857
00:53:55,692 --> 00:53:56,943
A What?

858
00:53:57,027 --> 00:53:59,321
Shep Proudfoot.
That's a name.

859
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,281
Yeah.

860
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:03,992
Okay. Yeah.

861
00:54:05,118 --> 00:54:06,953
Think I'll take
a drive
down there, then.

862
00:54:07,037 --> 00:54:08,997
Oh, yeah?
Twin Cities.

863
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,001
Oh, yeah?

864
00:54:27,182 --> 00:54:30,101
Damn it, I want to be
a part of this thing.

865
00:54:30,185 --> 00:54:32,395
No. Wade,
they were real clear.

866
00:54:32,479 --> 00:54:34,359
They said they'd
call tomorrow
with instructions,

867
00:54:34,397 --> 00:54:36,274
and it's gotta be
delivered by me alone.

868
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:38,652
It's my money,
I'll deliver it.

869
00:54:39,152 --> 00:54:40,445
What do they care?

870
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:41,780
Wade's got
a point, there.

871
00:54:41,863 --> 00:54:43,423
I'll handle the call
if you want, Jerry.

872
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:44,699
No, no. See, they...

873
00:54:44,783 --> 00:54:47,035
No. See, they only
deal with me.

874
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:50,872
You feel this nervousness
on the phone there.

875
00:54:50,956 --> 00:54:53,625
They're very...
These guys
are dangerous.

876
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:56,252
All the more reason.
I don't want you...

877
00:54:56,336 --> 00:54:59,172
With all due respect, Jerry,
I don't want you
mucking this up.

878
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:00,298
What the heck
do you mean?

879
00:55:00,382 --> 00:55:01,984
They want my money,
they can deal with me.

880
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:03,488
Otherwise,
I'm going to
a professional.

881
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:05,220
No. see...
There's $1 million here.

882
00:55:05,303 --> 00:55:06,346
No. See...

883
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:09,265
Look, Jerry,
you're not selling me
a damn car!

884
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:11,685
It's my show here.
That's that!

885
00:55:13,395 --> 00:55:16,356
It's the way we'd prefer
to handle it, Jerry.

886
00:55:22,404 --> 00:55:24,447
Hi. How you doing?

887
00:55:24,531 --> 00:55:26,199
Real good.
How are you doing
today, ma'am?

888
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:28,576
I'm doing really
super there. Thanks.

889
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,496
I'm Mrs. Gunderson.
I have a reservation.

890
00:55:32,664 --> 00:55:35,000
Yep.
You sure do,
Mrs. Gunderson.

891
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:38,003
Is there a phone
down here, you think?

892
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:41,840
Detective Sibert?

893
00:55:41,923 --> 00:55:45,427
Yeah, this is Marge Gunderson
from up Brainerd. We spoke.

894
00:55:46,219 --> 00:55:48,722
Yeah. Well, actually,
I'm in town here.

895
00:55:48,805 --> 00:55:50,807
I had to do
a few things
in the Twin Cities,

896
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:52,475
so I thought
I'd check in with you

897
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,061
about that USFI search
on Shep Proudfoot.

898
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:58,106
Oh, yeah?

899
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,152
Well, maybe
I'll go visit with him
if I have...

900
00:56:02,235 --> 00:56:04,112
No. I can find that.

901
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:06,281
Yeah. Well,
thanks a bunch.

902
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:09,159
Say, say, would you
happen to know

903
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:12,120
a good place for lunch
in the downtown area?

904
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:14,456
The Radisson.

905
00:56:15,457 --> 00:56:17,542
Oh, yeah?
Is it reasonable?

906
00:57:34,661 --> 00:57:36,746
Hi. How you doing?

907
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:39,249
Yeah. I decided
not to park here.

908
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:41,960
Well, what do you mean?
You decided
not to park here?

909
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:44,879
Yeah, I just came in
and I decided
not to park here, so...

910
00:57:44,963 --> 00:57:47,632
But...
Well. I'm sorry. sir...

911
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:50,009
Yeah, I decided
not to... I...

912
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:52,095
You know, I'm not...

913
00:57:52,178 --> 00:57:54,472
I decided
not to take the trip,
as it turns out, <i>so...</i>

914
00:57:54,556 --> 00:57:57,767
Well, I'm sorry, sir,
we still got to
charge you the $4.

915
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:00,895
I just pulled in here.

916
00:58:01,062 --> 00:58:02,355
I just fucking
pulled in here.

917
00:58:02,438 --> 00:58:03,523
Well, but...

918
00:58:03,606 --> 00:58:06,109
See, there's a minimum
charge of $4.

919
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:08,945
Long-term parking
charges by the day.

920
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,828
I guess you think
you're, you know,
like an authority figure.

921
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:19,205
That stupid
fucking uniform,
huh, buddy?

922
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:20,748
King clip-on tie there.

923
00:58:20,832 --> 00:58:22,250
Big fucking man, huh?

924
00:58:22,876 --> 00:58:25,128
You know, these are
the limits
of your life, man.

925
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:26,647
Ruler of your
little fucking gate here.

926
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:28,631
Here. There's your $4,
you pathetic piece of shit.

927
00:58:31,885 --> 00:58:33,386
Where's Shep?

928
00:58:33,595 --> 00:58:35,305
Talking to a cop.

929
00:58:35,388 --> 00:58:36,556
Cop?

930
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:38,600
Said she was a cop.

931
00:58:41,269 --> 00:58:44,105
So do you remember
getting a call
Wednesday night?

932
00:58:44,189 --> 00:58:45,273
Nope.

933
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:49,194
You do reside there
at 1425 Freemont Terrace?

934
00:58:49,277 --> 00:58:50,278
Yep.

935
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:52,363
Anyone else
residing there?

936
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:53,531
No.

937
00:58:53,615 --> 00:58:57,577
Well, Mr. Proudfoot,
this call came in
past 3:00 in the morning.

938
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:01,789
It's just hard for me
to believe you don't
remember anyone calling.

939
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:04,584
Now, I know you've
had some problems.

940
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,544
Struggling with
the narcotics,

941
00:59:06,628 --> 00:59:09,547
some other entanglements,
currently on parole.

942
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:11,256
So?

943
00:59:11,299 --> 00:59:12,717
Well, associating
with criminals,

944
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,080
if you're the one
they talked to,

945
00:59:14,135 --> 00:59:17,305
that right there
would be a violation
of your parole.

946
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:19,891
Would end you up
back in Stillwater.

947
00:59:20,308 --> 00:59:22,268
Now, I saw some
rough stuff
on your priors,

948
00:59:22,352 --> 00:59:23,978
but nothing
in the nature of
a homicide.

949
00:59:24,062 --> 00:59:28,024
I know you don't want
to be an accessory
to something like that.

950
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:31,212
So, you think
you might remember

951
00:59:31,236 --> 00:59:33,738
who those folks
were who called you?

952
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:43,873
Mr. Lundegaard?

953
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:45,124
Yeah.

954
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:47,085
Could I take just a minute
of your time here?

955
00:59:47,168 --> 00:59:49,003
What is it all about?

956
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:50,755
Do you mind
if I sit down?

957
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:52,840
Carrying quite
a load here.

958
00:59:53,049 --> 00:59:54,926
You're the owner here,
Mr. Lundegaard?

959
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:57,387
No. I...
Executive Sales Manager.

960
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:59,323
Well, you can help me.
My name's Marge Gunderson.

961
00:59:59,347 --> 01:00:01,516
My father-in-law,
he's the owner.

962
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:02,767
Uh-huh.

963
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,811
Well, I'm a police officer
from up Brainerd,

964
01:00:04,894 --> 01:00:06,646
investigating
some malfeasance.

965
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:09,232
And I was just wondering
if you'd had
any new vehicles

966
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:12,360
stolen off the lot
in the past couple of weeks.

967
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:15,947
Specifically
a tan Cutlass Cierra.

968
01:00:20,535 --> 01:00:22,036
Mr. Lundegaard.

969
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:25,915
Brainerd.

970
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,001
Yeah, yeah.

971
01:00:28,084 --> 01:00:30,628
Home of Paul Bunyan,
Babe, the Blue Ox.

972
01:00:30,712 --> 01:00:32,380
Babe, the Blue Ox.

973
01:00:36,426 --> 01:00:39,554
Yeah, you know,
we got that
big statue up there.

974
01:00:42,056 --> 01:00:45,685
So, you haven't had
any vehicles
go missing, then?

975
01:00:45,768 --> 01:00:47,270
Nope. No, ma'am.

976
01:00:48,229 --> 01:00:49,480
Okey-dokey.
Thanks a bunch.

977
01:00:49,564 --> 01:00:52,567
I'll let you get back
to your paperwork, then.

978
01:01:06,748 --> 01:01:08,333
<i>Service.</i>
Yeah. get me Shep.

979
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:09,667
He's <i>not here
right now.</i>

980
01:01:09,751 --> 01:01:10,793
What the heck
do you mean?

981
01:01:10,877 --> 01:01:12,378
<i>He stepped out.</i>

982
01:01:12,462 --> 01:01:14,023
Where'd he go? It's only...
<i>I'll</i> get you Artie.

983
01:01:14,047 --> 01:01:17,216
No. I don't need
a mechanic. I need a...

984
01:01:19,761 --> 01:01:23,264
Jeez. I gotta talk
to a friend of his,

985
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:25,350
so...

986
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:27,977
Have him...

987
01:01:29,354 --> 01:01:30,396
<i>What?</i>

988
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,522
Oh, jeez.

989
01:01:52,377 --> 01:01:53,461
Mike?

990
01:01:54,337 --> 01:01:55,463
Marge?

991
01:01:57,423 --> 01:02:00,134
Jeez! Oh, you look great!

992
01:02:00,218 --> 01:02:02,470
Yeah. 80 do you.
Easy there. Easy...

993
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:05,890
Easy there.
Easy there.
You do, too.

994
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:07,558
I'm expecting now.

995
01:02:07,642 --> 01:02:09,894
I see that.
That's great.

996
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:11,354
What can I get you?

997
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:13,272
Just a Diet Coke, please.

998
01:02:13,356 --> 01:02:14,982
Great.

999
01:02:15,691 --> 01:02:17,026
This is a nice place.

1000
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:20,530
Yeah. You know,
it's the Radisson,
so it's pretty good.

1001
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:21,781
Yeah.

1002
01:02:26,202 --> 01:02:27,328
So...

1003
01:02:28,037 --> 01:02:29,455
You're living
in Edina, then?

1004
01:02:29,539 --> 01:02:31,666
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A couple of years now.

1005
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:33,459
It's actually
Eden Prairie.

1006
01:02:33,543 --> 01:02:35,128
That school district.

1007
01:02:35,503 --> 01:02:38,172
80, Chief Gunderson, then!

1008
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:41,175
So, you went and married
Norm son-of-a-Gunderson.

1009
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:42,927
Oh, yeah.
Long time ago.

1010
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,637
Great, great.

1011
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:47,390
So, what brings you down?

1012
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:49,600
Are you down here
on that homicide,

1013
01:02:49,684 --> 01:02:51,936
if you're allowed,
you know,
to discuss that?

1014
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:53,312
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1015
01:02:53,396 --> 01:02:56,190
But there's not
a heck of
a lot to discuss.

1016
01:02:57,108 --> 01:02:58,609
Okay.

1017
01:02:58,693 --> 01:02:59,986
Well, what about you, Mike?

1018
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:01,320
Are you married?

1019
01:03:01,404 --> 01:03:02,488
You got kids?

1020
01:03:02,572 --> 01:03:04,365
Yeah, yeah. Well...

1021
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:07,618
I was married.
I was married to...

1022
01:03:07,702 --> 01:03:09,620
You mind
if I sit over here?

1023
01:03:09,704 --> 01:03:11,747
I was married
to Linda Cooksey.

1024
01:03:11,831 --> 01:03:14,876
No. Why don't
you sit over there?
I prefer that.

1025
01:03:18,087 --> 01:03:19,213
Okay.

1026
01:03:22,133 --> 01:03:23,217
Sorry.

1027
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:26,053
No. no.
Just so I can see you.
Don't have to turn my neck.

1028
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:28,389
Sure, sure. I understand.

1029
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:30,850
I didn't mean to...

1030
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:34,395
No, no. That's fine.

1031
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:38,983
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

1032
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:42,403
So, I was married
to Linda Cooksey.

1033
01:03:42,487 --> 01:03:45,281
You remember Linda.
She was a year behind us.

1034
01:03:45,364 --> 01:03:46,824
Yeah. I think
I remember her.

1035
01:03:46,908 --> 01:03:49,660
Yeah! She...
Oh, yeah!

1036
01:03:49,744 --> 01:03:51,329
So, it didn't
work out, huh?

1037
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:54,999
And then I've been
working for Honeywell
for a few years now.

1038
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:56,250
Well, they're
a good outfit.

1039
01:03:56,334 --> 01:04:00,046
Yeah, if you're
an engineer, yeah,
you could do a lot worse.

1040
01:04:00,129 --> 01:04:01,839
But it's not...

1041
01:04:01,923 --> 01:04:04,091
It's nothing like
your achievement.

1042
01:04:04,175 --> 01:04:07,178
Well, it sounds like
you're doing really super.

1043
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:08,846
It's not that...

1044
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:12,141
It's not that things
didn't work out. It's...

1045
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:16,395
Linda had leukemia,
you know.

1046
01:04:17,188 --> 01:04:19,315
She was...
She passed away.

1047
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:20,775
No.

1048
01:04:23,236 --> 01:04:24,362
It was tough.

1049
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:25,738
There you go.

1050
01:04:26,197 --> 01:04:27,865
It was long...

1051
01:04:29,242 --> 01:04:31,827
She fought
real hard, Marge.

1052
01:04:32,745 --> 01:04:34,121
You know...

1053
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:36,457
So, what can you say?

1054
01:04:39,418 --> 01:04:41,712
Better times, huh?

1055
01:04:41,796 --> 01:04:43,256
Better times.

1056
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:50,638
And then I saw you on the TV
and I remembered, you know?

1057
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:52,557
I always liked you.

1058
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,891
Well, I always
liked you...

1059
01:04:53,975 --> 01:04:55,685
I always
liked you so much.

1060
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:02,692
So, Mike, should
we get together
another time, you think?

1061
01:05:02,775 --> 01:05:04,110
<i>NOH...</i>

1062
01:05:08,447 --> 01:05:10,074
I'm sorry. It's...

1063
01:05:10,157 --> 01:05:12,577
You know,
I shouldn't have
done this.

1064
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,704
I shouldn't have done this.
I shouldn't.

1065
01:05:14,787 --> 01:05:17,331
I thought we'd have
a really terrific time.

1066
01:05:17,415 --> 01:05:18,791
It's okay, Mike.

1067
01:05:18,874 --> 01:05:21,419
You were
such a super lady.

1068
01:05:21,502 --> 01:05:24,755
And then...
I've been so lonely.

1069
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:29,135
It's okay, Mike.

1070
01:05:35,474 --> 01:05:39,312
<i>Here's a song
I dedicate to all the ladies
out here tonight.</i>

1071
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:41,564
<i>Goes like this.</i>

1072
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:45,526
<i>Let's find
each other tonight</i>

1073
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,779
<i>Everything
will be all right</i>

1074
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:52,116
<i>Don't hesitate now</i>

1075
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:53,868
<i>Let's find
each other tonight</i>

1076
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:55,286
So...

1077
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:57,872
Are you
from around here?

1078
01:05:58,706 --> 01:06:00,541
Just in town on business.

1079
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:02,209
Just in and out.

1080
01:06:04,962 --> 01:06:07,506
Just a little
of the old in-and-out.

1081
01:06:08,591 --> 01:06:10,051
What do you do?

1082
01:06:11,302 --> 01:06:12,386
I...

1083
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:17,892
You been to
the Celebrity Room
before?

1084
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:19,894
With other clients?

1085
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:21,896
I don't think so.

1086
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:23,439
It's nice.

1087
01:06:23,522 --> 01:06:25,983
Yeah, well,
depends on the artist.

1088
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:29,236
You know, Jose Feliciano,
you got no complaints.

1089
01:06:29,904 --> 01:06:30,946
Waiter!

1090
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:34,784
What is he, deaf?

1091
01:06:35,618 --> 01:06:36,911
So...

1092
01:06:37,953 --> 01:06:40,331
How long you work
for the escort service?

1093
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:42,541
I don't know.
A few months.

1094
01:06:43,626 --> 01:06:46,087
Find that work
interesting, do you?

1095
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:49,256
What are you
talking about?

1096
01:06:49,757 --> 01:06:51,092
Right.

1097
01:06:51,175 --> 01:06:52,510
Come on.

1098
01:06:52,593 --> 01:06:54,595
I'm hearing bells.
Come on.

1099
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:58,974
All right.
Where were you?

1100
01:07:03,145 --> 01:07:06,607
Shep, what the hell
are you doing?
I'm banging that girl.

1101
01:07:06,691 --> 01:07:11,070
Fucking asshole.
Get the fuck
out of here.

1102
01:07:11,153 --> 01:07:14,156
Put me back in Stillwater,
you little
fucking shithead.

1103
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,783
Get the fuck out of here.

1104
01:07:16,951 --> 01:07:18,869
Yo!
Cut that shit out, man.

1105
01:07:18,953 --> 01:07:20,913
Trying to get some
goddamn sleep here.

1106
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:23,040
Come on, brother...

1107
01:07:23,124 --> 01:07:24,417
Fuck you!

1108
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:32,216
Fuck you.

1109
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:33,509
Animals!

1110
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:37,096
Stay away from me, man.

1111
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:39,265
Hey, smoke
a fucking peace pipe!

1112
01:07:39,348 --> 01:07:41,267
Don't you dare
fucking hit me!

1113
01:07:48,649 --> 01:07:50,401
Fucking little weasel!

1114
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:52,194
Fuck you. man.
Stop it!

1115
01:07:52,278 --> 01:07:56,073
You fucking, motherfucking,
son-of-a-bitching,
fucking cock!

1116
01:07:56,157 --> 01:07:59,827
Jesus Christ! You fucking
shitbag motherfucker!

1117
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:04,789
<i>Yeah?</i>

1118
01:08:04,832 --> 01:08:06,143
All right, Jerry,
I'm through
fucking around.

1119
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:07,251
<i>You got
the fucking money?</i>

1120
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:09,378
Yeah, I got
the money, but...

1121
01:08:09,462 --> 01:08:11,130
<i>Don't you fucking
but me, Jerry.</i>

1122
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:14,216
<i>I want you to put this money
in the Dayton Radisson
parking ramp, top level,</i>

1123
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,861
<i>30 minutes, Jerry,
we wrap this thing up.</i>

1124
01:08:15,885 --> 01:08:16,927
Okay. But...

1125
01:08:17,011 --> 01:08:19,263
Hey, you're there
in 30 minutes
or I find you, Jerry,

1126
01:08:19,346 --> 01:08:20,907
and I shoot you and
I shoot
your fucking wife,

1127
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:22,284
and I shoot
all your little
fucking children

1128
01:08:22,308 --> 01:08:24,828
and I shoot them all
in the back of their little
fucking heads. You got it?

1129
01:08:24,852 --> 01:08:26,687
Okay, now, you stay away
from Scotty, now.

1130
01:08:26,771 --> 01:08:27,772
<i>Got it?</i>

1131
01:08:27,855 --> 01:08:29,523
Okay. Real good, then.

1132
01:08:54,548 --> 01:08:55,758
Dad.

1133
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:57,802
It's okay, Scotty.

1134
01:08:57,885 --> 01:08:59,553
Where you going?

1135
01:08:59,887 --> 01:09:01,931
I'll be back
in a minute.

1136
01:09:02,223 --> 01:09:06,560
If Stan calls,
you just tell him
I went to Embers.

1137
01:09:08,896 --> 01:09:09,939
Okay.

1138
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:12,608
Here's your damn money.

1139
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,402
Now, where's my daughter?

1140
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:17,196
Yeah.

1141
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:20,491
You goddamn punk!

1142
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:38,592
Who the fuck are you?

1143
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:43,222
Who the fuck are you?

1144
01:09:43,305 --> 01:09:46,392
I got your damn money.
Now, where's my daughter?

1145
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:48,978
I am through
fucking around!

1146
01:09:49,061 --> 01:09:50,729
Drop that fucking briefcase!

1147
01:09:50,813 --> 01:09:52,439
Where's my daughter?

1148
01:09:52,523 --> 01:09:54,859
Fuck you, man!
Where's Jerry?

1149
01:09:54,942 --> 01:09:57,236
I gave simple
fucking instructions.

1150
01:09:57,319 --> 01:09:59,029
Where's my damn daughter?

1151
01:09:59,113 --> 01:10:00,447
No Jean, no money.

1152
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:02,408
Drop that fucking money!

1153
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:04,159
No Jean, no money!

1154
01:10:05,953 --> 01:10:07,955
Is this a fucking joke here?

1155
01:10:14,461 --> 01:10:17,923
Oh, jeez.

1156
01:10:18,007 --> 01:10:20,092
You happy now, asshole?

1157
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:21,886
What's with you people?

1158
01:10:21,969 --> 01:10:23,804
You fucking imbeciles!

1159
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:33,814
You fucking shot me!

1160
01:11:50,891 --> 01:11:52,977
May I have your ticket,
please?

1161
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:54,812
Open the fucking gate!

1162
01:12:34,309 --> 01:12:35,769
Oh, jeez.

1163
01:13:06,008 --> 01:13:07,092
Dad?

1164
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:08,302
Yeah?

1165
01:13:08,761 --> 01:13:10,512
Stan Grossman called.

1166
01:13:10,888 --> 01:13:12,139
Yeah. Okay.

1167
01:13:12,264 --> 01:13:13,265
Twice.

1168
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:14,391
Okay.

1169
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:18,103
Is everything okay?

1170
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:19,605
Yeah.

1171
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:23,150
Are you calling Stan?

1172
01:13:25,277 --> 01:13:26,862
Well, I'm...

1173
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:30,282
I'm going to bed now.

1174
01:14:07,152 --> 01:14:08,278
How you doing?

1175
01:14:08,362 --> 01:14:10,030
Mr. Mohra?
Yeah?

1176
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:11,490
Officer Olson.

1177
01:14:11,573 --> 01:14:13,075
Yeah. Righto.

1178
01:14:13,951 --> 01:14:15,119
Well...

1179
01:14:15,202 --> 01:14:18,413
So I'm tending bar
down there at Ecklund and
Swedlin's last Tuesday,

1180
01:14:18,497 --> 01:14:20,207
and this little
guy's drinking,

1181
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,292
and he says,
"Where can a guy
find some action?

1182
01:14:22,376 --> 01:14:24,628
"I'm going crazy out
there at the lake."

1183
01:14:24,711 --> 01:14:26,213
And I says,
"What kind of action?"

1184
01:14:26,296 --> 01:14:28,465
And he says,
"Woman action.
What do I look like?"

1185
01:14:28,549 --> 01:14:30,029
And I says,
"Well, what do
I look like?

1186
01:14:30,092 --> 01:14:32,261
"I don't arrange
that kind of thing."

1187
01:14:32,344 --> 01:14:34,847
And he says,
"But I'm going crazy
out there at the lake."

1188
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:38,183
And I says,
"Yeah, but this ain't
that kind of place.”

1189
01:14:38,267 --> 01:14:41,770
He says, "Oh, so I get it.
So you think I'm some
kind of jerk for asking."

1190
01:14:41,854 --> 01:14:43,397
Only he don't use
the word "jerk."

1191
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,023
I understand.
Then he calls me a jerk.

1192
01:14:45,107 --> 01:14:47,568
Says the last guy
thought he's a jerk
is dead now.

1193
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:49,236
So, I don't
say nothing.

1194
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:51,196
He says,
"What do you think
about that?"

1195
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,700
And I says, "Well,
that don't sound like too
good a deal for him, then."

1196
01:14:54,783 --> 01:14:55,826
You got that right.

1197
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:57,661
Yeah, he says,
"Yeah,
that guy's dead,

1198
01:14:57,744 --> 01:14:59,246
"and I don't mean
of old age."

1199
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:02,833
And then he says,
"Jeez, I'm going crazy
out there at the lake."

1200
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:03,959
White Bear Lake?

1201
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:06,522
Yeah, well, at Ecklund
and Swedlin,
that's closer to Moose Lake.

1202
01:15:06,587 --> 01:15:07,713
So I made
that assumption.

1203
01:15:07,796 --> 01:15:08,797
Sure.

1204
01:15:08,881 --> 01:15:10,674
Anyway, he's drinking
at the bar,

1205
01:15:10,757 --> 01:15:12,467
so I don't think
a whole great deal of it,

1206
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:15,554
but then Mrs. Mohra,
she heard about
the homicides down here

1207
01:15:15,637 --> 01:15:19,766
and thought
I should call it in,
so I called it in.

1208
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,604
End of story.

1209
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:25,748
Well, what'd this
guy look like,
anyways?

1210
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:27,357
Oh, he's a...

1211
01:15:27,441 --> 01:15:29,067
Little guy,
kind of funny-looking.

1212
01:15:30,027 --> 01:15:31,361
In what way?

1213
01:15:31,445 --> 01:15:33,447
Just in a general
kind of way.

1214
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:36,116
Okay.
Well. thanks a bunch,
Mr. Mohra.

1215
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,868
You're right.
It's probably nothing,

1216
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:39,161
but thanks
for calling her in.

1217
01:15:39,244 --> 01:15:40,495
Sure.

1218
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:43,165
Looks like she's gonna
turn cold tomorrow.

1219
01:15:43,248 --> 01:15:45,542
Oh, yeah.
Got a front coming in.

1220
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:47,920
Yeah.
You got that right.

1221
01:16:07,272 --> 01:16:08,649
Jesus Christ.

1222
01:18:25,369 --> 01:18:28,747
Valerie,
I'm leaving this morning,
back up to Brainerd.

1223
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:31,291
<i>Well, I'm sorry
I won't see you.</i>

1224
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:32,751
But you think
he's all right?

1225
01:18:32,834 --> 01:18:34,002
I saw him
last night and...

1226
01:18:34,086 --> 01:18:35,087
<i>What did he say?</i>

1227
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:36,880
Well, it's nothing
specific he said.

1228
01:18:36,963 --> 01:18:40,175
It just seemed like
it all hit him really hard,
his wife dying.

1229
01:18:40,258 --> 01:18:42,177
His <i>wife?</i>
Linda.

1230
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:44,221
<i>Who?</i>
Linda Cooksey.

1231
01:18:44,304 --> 01:18:46,139
<i>No. No, no.
They weren't...</i>

1232
01:18:46,223 --> 01:18:49,142
<i>He was bothering Linda
for about...
For a good year.</i>

1233
01:18:49,226 --> 01:18:52,312
<i>Really pestering her,
wouldn't
leave her alone.</i>

1234
01:18:52,646 --> 01:18:53,939
So...

1235
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:55,941
He didn't...

1236
01:18:56,483 --> 01:18:57,484
He never...

1237
01:18:57,567 --> 01:18:59,236
<i>No! No,
they never married.</i>

1238
01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:01,822
<i>Mike's had
psychiatric problems.</i>

1239
01:19:01,905 --> 01:19:03,281
Oh, my.

1240
01:19:03,365 --> 01:19:04,908
<i>Yeah, he's been
struggling.</i>

1241
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:07,327
<i>He's living
with his parents now.</i>

1242
01:19:08,495 --> 01:19:09,830
Oh, jeez.

1243
01:19:09,913 --> 01:19:12,290
<i>Linda's fine.
You should call her.</i>

1244
01:19:12,374 --> 01:19:13,959
Jeez. Well...

1245
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:15,669
Jeez.

1246
01:19:17,421 --> 01:19:19,089
That's a surprise.

1247
01:19:29,141 --> 01:19:30,308
Hello!

1248
01:20:11,266 --> 01:20:14,269
Mr. Lundegaard,
sorry to bother you again.
Can I come in?

1249
01:20:14,352 --> 01:20:17,397
Yeah... No.
I'm kind of busy here.

1250
01:20:17,481 --> 01:20:19,983
I understand.
I'll keep it
real short, then.

1251
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:22,903
I'm on my way out of town,
but I was wondering...

1252
01:20:22,986 --> 01:20:24,154
Do you mind
if I sit down?

1253
01:20:24,237 --> 01:20:25,405
Carrying a bit
of a load here.

1254
01:20:25,489 --> 01:20:26,615
No, I...

1255
01:20:26,698 --> 01:20:28,468
Yeah, it's this vehicle
I asked about yesterday.

1256
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:29,493
I was just wondering...

1257
01:20:29,576 --> 01:20:32,704
Yeah, like I told you,
we haven't had
any vehicles go missing.

1258
01:20:32,787 --> 01:20:34,873
Okay. Are you sure?

1259
01:20:35,874 --> 01:20:38,293
'Cause I mean,
how do you know?

1260
01:20:38,376 --> 01:20:40,003
Because, see,
the crime
I'm investigating,

1261
01:20:40,086 --> 01:20:42,297
the perpetrators
were driving a car
with dealer plates,

1262
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:43,691
and they called
someone who works here,

1263
01:20:43,715 --> 01:20:45,401
so it'd be
quite a coincidence
if they weren't,

1264
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:47,260
you know, connected.

1265
01:20:47,886 --> 01:20:49,262
Yeah, I see.

1266
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:50,805
So, how do you...

1267
01:20:50,889 --> 01:20:53,016
Have you done any kind
of inventory recently?

1268
01:20:53,099 --> 01:20:54,726
The car's not
from our lot, ma'am.

1269
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:56,895
But how do you know
that for sure
without doing a...

1270
01:20:56,978 --> 01:20:58,688
Well, I would know.

1271
01:20:58,813 --> 01:21:00,524
I'm the Executive
Sales Manager.

1272
01:21:00,607 --> 01:21:02,317
Yeah, but I understand...

1273
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,902
We run a pretty tight
ship here.

1274
01:21:03,985 --> 01:21:05,028
I know, but...

1275
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:07,155
Well, how do
they establish that, sir?

1276
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:08,657
I mean.
Are the cars counted daily.

1277
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:10,575
Or what kind
of a routine here?

1278
01:21:10,659 --> 01:21:13,119
Ma'am, I answered
your question.

1279
01:21:17,457 --> 01:21:18,500
I'm sorry, sir?

1280
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:20,877
Ma'am, I answered
your question.

1281
01:21:21,503 --> 01:21:22,587
I answered the darn...

1282
01:21:22,671 --> 01:21:25,966
I'm cooperating here,
and there's no...

1283
01:21:29,636 --> 01:21:32,472
Sir, you have no call
to get snippy with me.

1284
01:21:32,556 --> 01:21:34,057
I'm just doing
my job here.

1285
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,308
I'm...

1286
01:21:36,977 --> 01:21:40,230
I'm not...
I'm not arguing here.

1287
01:21:40,313 --> 01:21:42,732
I'm cooperating,
and there's no...

1288
01:21:42,816 --> 01:21:44,859
We're doing all we can.

1289
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:54,411
Sir, could I talk
to Mr. Gustafson?

1290
01:21:58,373 --> 01:21:59,916
Mr. Lundegaard.

1291
01:22:03,128 --> 01:22:06,548
Well, heck! If you wanna...
If you wanna play games here,

1292
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:09,259
I'm working with you
on this thing here, but...

1293
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:12,262
Okay!
I'll do a damn
lot count!

1294
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:13,430
Sir, right now?

1295
01:22:13,513 --> 01:22:15,140
Yeah! Right now.

1296
01:22:15,807 --> 01:22:17,559
You're darn tooting!

1297
01:22:18,226 --> 01:22:21,479
If it's so damned
important to you.

1298
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:23,773
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

1299
01:22:23,857 --> 01:22:26,067
What the Christ! Jeez!

1300
01:22:39,581 --> 01:22:42,417
<i>Bob Elcorona, line two.</i>

1301
01:23:10,862 --> 01:23:12,614
For Pete's sake.

1302
01:23:16,326 --> 01:23:18,244
For Pete's sake,
he's fleeing
the interview.

1303
01:23:18,328 --> 01:23:20,455
He's fleeing
the interview!

1304
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:24,250
How do I get
an outside line here?

1305
01:23:26,086 --> 01:23:27,337
All right.

1306
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:32,884
Yeah.
Detective Sibert, please.

1307
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:37,406
<i>I told you it was over,
and I thought
I made myself very clear.</i>

1308
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:40,183
<i>Oh, you did.
You made yourself
perfectly clear.</i>

1309
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:42,185
<i>But something's
come up.</i>

1310
01:23:42,602 --> 01:23:43,728
<i>What?</i>

1311
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:45,380
<i>Well, it's something
kind of small,</i>

1312
01:23:45,438 --> 01:23:47,607
<i>but it might be
a big problem.</i>

1313
01:23:47,774 --> 01:23:49,275
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

1314
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,320
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

1315
01:23:54,197 --> 01:23:56,741
<i>I've had a doctor's test,
I've got the certificate,</i>

1316
01:23:56,825 --> 01:24:00,370
<i>and there's no
doubt about it.
I'm gonna have your baby.</i>

1317
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:05,458
<i>Now, look here.
I can explain this.</i>

1318
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:09,045
<i>See, Robin was...
Is a student of mine.</i>

1319
01:24:09,963 --> 01:24:12,215
You should see
the other guy.

1320
01:24:12,799 --> 01:24:14,676
<i>No, no, no.
It wasn't anything
like that.</i>

1321
01:24:14,759 --> 01:24:15,885
<i>You don't understand!</i>

1322
01:24:15,969 --> 01:24:17,721
<i>I read that letter
that she wrote.</i>

1323
01:24:17,804 --> 01:24:19,389
<i>I think I understand
all there is...</i>

1324
01:24:19,472 --> 01:24:21,224
What happened to her?

1325
01:24:22,517 --> 01:24:25,186
She started shrieking,
you know.

1326
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:26,354
Jeez.

1327
01:24:27,147 --> 01:24:29,190
Well, I got the money.

1328
01:24:29,691 --> 01:24:32,402
All of it, all 80 grand.

1329
01:24:34,571 --> 01:24:37,282
That's 40 for you,
40 for me.

1330
01:24:39,325 --> 01:24:40,952
That's it, then.

1331
01:24:45,665 --> 01:24:47,167
You can have my truck.

1332
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:48,835
I'm taking the Cierra.

1333
01:24:48,918 --> 01:24:50,420
We split that.

1334
01:24:52,505 --> 01:24:55,800
How the fuck do
you split a fucking car,
you dummy?

1335
01:24:56,092 --> 01:24:58,094
With a fucking chain saw?

1336
01:24:58,344 --> 01:25:01,014
One of us pays
the other for half.

1337
01:25:01,264 --> 01:25:03,725
Hold on.
No fucking way.

1338
01:25:04,642 --> 01:25:06,728
Did you fucking
notice this?

1339
01:25:07,562 --> 01:25:09,314
I got fucking shot!

1340
01:25:09,689 --> 01:25:11,941
I got fucking
shot in the face!

1341
01:25:12,025 --> 01:25:13,568
I went and got
the fucking money!

1342
01:25:13,651 --> 01:25:15,403
I got shot
fucking picking it up!

1343
01:25:15,487 --> 01:25:18,198
I've been up
for 36 fucking hours!

1344
01:25:19,532 --> 01:25:20,950
I'm taking
that fucking car!

1345
01:25:21,034 --> 01:25:24,370
That fuck is mine,
you fucking asshole.

1346
01:25:24,621 --> 01:25:27,874
You know, I've been
listening to your
fucking bullshit all week!

1347
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:29,542
Are we square?

1348
01:25:31,586 --> 01:25:33,379
Are we square?

1349
01:25:35,423 --> 01:25:37,342
Yeah, you fucking mute!

1350
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:41,304
And if you see your friend,
Shep Proudfoot,

1351
01:25:41,387 --> 01:25:43,890
tell him I'm gonna
nail his fucking ass.

1352
01:25:46,017 --> 01:25:48,228
<i>I'll call you...
Later.</i>

1353
01:25:59,989 --> 01:26:03,159
<i>His wife.
This guy says she was
kidnapped last Wednesday.</i>

1354
01:26:03,243 --> 01:26:04,661
The day of
our homicides.

1355
01:26:04,744 --> 01:26:05,829
<i>Yeah.</i>

1356
01:26:05,912 --> 01:26:07,247
And this guy was who?

1357
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:09,958
<i>Lundegaard's
father-in-law's
accountant.</i>

1358
01:26:10,041 --> 01:26:11,668
Gustafson's accountant.

1359
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:12,919
<i>Yeah.</i>

1360
01:26:13,002 --> 01:26:14,671
But we still
haven't found Gustafson?

1361
01:26:14,754 --> 01:26:16,464
<i>...looking...</i>

1362
01:26:16,548 --> 01:26:18,258
Sorry. Didn't copy, Lou.

1363
01:26:18,341 --> 01:26:19,926
<i>Still missing.
We're looking.</i>

1364
01:26:20,009 --> 01:26:22,011
Copy.
And Lundegaard. too?

1365
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:24,639
<i>Yeah.
Where are you. Margie?</i>

1366
01:26:24,722 --> 01:26:25,849
I'm almost back.

1367
01:26:25,932 --> 01:26:27,517
I'm taking a drive
around Moose Lake.

1368
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,602
<i>Gary's loudmouth.</i>

1369
01:26:29,894 --> 01:26:31,271
Yeah, the loudmouth.

1370
01:26:31,354 --> 01:26:32,939
So the whole state
has it, huh?

1371
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:34,858
Gustafson and Lundegaard?

1372
01:26:34,941 --> 01:26:36,192
<i>Yeah.
It's over the wire.</i>

1373
01:26:36,276 --> 01:26:37,694
<i>It's everywhere.
They'll find them.</i>

1374
01:26:37,777 --> 01:26:38,903
Copy.

1375
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:40,488
<i>Yeah, we got
a lead on this...</i>

1376
01:26:40,572 --> 01:26:41,906
There's the car!
There's the car!

1377
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:43,032
<i>Whose car?</i>

1378
01:26:43,116 --> 01:26:46,452
My car! My car!
Tan Cierra! Tan Cierra!

1379
01:26:47,036 --> 01:26:50,039
<i>Okay. Careful. Margie.
I'll send
a couple cars.</i>

1380
01:28:43,528 --> 01:28:44,737
Police!

1381
01:28:52,495 --> 01:28:54,080
Hands up!

1382
01:28:54,372 --> 01:28:55,581
Police!

1383
01:28:58,876 --> 01:29:00,169
Police!

1384
01:30:00,146 --> 01:30:03,357
So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
on the floor in there.

1385
01:30:08,488 --> 01:30:11,991
And I guess that was
your accomplice
in the wood chipper.

1386
01:30:16,662 --> 01:30:19,123
And those three people
in Brainerd.

1387
01:30:24,504 --> 01:30:25,963
And for what?

1388
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:29,175
For a little bit of money.

1389
01:30:34,722 --> 01:30:38,017
There's more to life than
a little money, you know?

1390
01:30:47,652 --> 01:30:49,403
Don't you know that?

1391
01:30:55,827 --> 01:30:57,537
And here you are.

1392
01:30:58,746 --> 01:31:00,706
And it's a beautiful day.

1393
01:31:10,049 --> 01:31:11,259
Well...

1394
01:31:24,105 --> 01:31:26,232
I just don't understand it.

1395
01:32:08,566 --> 01:32:10,026
Mr. Anderson?

1396
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,570
Who?

1397
01:32:12,653 --> 01:32:16,115
Mr. Anderson, is this
your burgundy '98
out here?

1398
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:18,993
Just a sec.

1399
01:32:19,076 --> 01:32:20,786
Could you open
the door, please?

1400
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:22,788
Yeah, yeah,
just a sec.

1401
01:32:23,289 --> 01:32:24,624
Just a sec.

1402
01:32:32,215 --> 01:32:34,175
- Dale!
- My leg!

1403
01:32:34,258 --> 01:32:35,468
No!

1404
01:33:14,757 --> 01:33:16,425
They announced it.

1405
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:19,428
They announced it?

1406
01:33:19,512 --> 01:33:20,638
Yeah.

1407
01:33:21,138 --> 01:33:22,181
So?

1408
01:33:23,182 --> 01:33:24,809
Three-cent stamp.

1409
01:33:25,518 --> 01:33:27,019
Your mallard?

1410
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:28,312
Yeah.

1411
01:33:29,188 --> 01:33:31,023
That's terrific.

1412
01:33:31,107 --> 01:33:33,025
It's just
a three-cent.

1413
01:33:33,567 --> 01:33:34,694
It's terrific.

1414
01:33:34,777 --> 01:33:37,488
Hautman's
blue-winged teal
got the 29-Cent.

1415
01:33:38,114 --> 01:33:40,241
People don't much
use the three-cent.

1416
01:33:40,324 --> 01:33:42,868
Oh, for Pete's...
Of course they do.

1417
01:33:44,078 --> 01:33:45,579
Whenever they
raise the postage,

1418
01:33:45,663 --> 01:33:47,540
people need
the little stamps.

1419
01:33:47,999 --> 01:33:49,375
Yeah?

1420
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:52,461
When they're stuck
with a bunch
of the old ones.

1421
01:33:52,545 --> 01:33:53,754
Yeah.

1422
01:33:54,547 --> 01:33:55,881
I guess.

1423
01:33:57,383 --> 01:34:00,553
That's terrific.
I'm so proud
of you, Norm.

1424
01:34:04,056 --> 01:34:07,059
Heck, Norm, you know,
we're doing pretty good.

1425
01:34:09,645 --> 01:34:11,397
I love you, Margie.

1426
01:34:12,481 --> 01:34:14,066
I love you, Norm.

1427
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:18,904
Two more months.

1428
01:34:22,491 --> 01:34:24,076
Two more months.
