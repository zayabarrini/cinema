1
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:43,547
HIDDEN AWAY

2
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:13,267
Hey, you!

3
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:17,347
Yes, you!
Think I didn't see you?

4
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:21,987
What's going on?

5
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:23,507
I'll tell you what's going on.

6
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:26,067
If I'm not here they
empty out your store.

7
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,627
Give me that!

8
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:31,947
I'm calling the police.
Don't even move!

9
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:33,987
But I haven't done anything.

10
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:36,347
Sure, and how you gonna
pay for this?

11
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,627
With this.
What is it with you?

12
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,347
We're Arabs so we're thieves?

13
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,267
- No, it's not like that...
- No shit it ain't!

14
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:48,067
Don't be like that,
it's been a misunderstanding.

15
00:03:48,107 --> 00:03:50,227
I do whatever the fuck I want!
Give me that!

16
00:03:50,627 --> 00:03:52,627
You disgust me!

17
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,267
Let's get out of here!

18
00:04:17,747 --> 00:04:19,267
No wonder you got caught.

19
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:21,787
It's just that...

20
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:23,147
Don't come to me with excuses.

21
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:26,267
I don't care, it's just how
you were doing it.

22
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,267
You should learn a few things.

23
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,107
No...
I won't do it again...

24
00:04:31,427 --> 00:04:34,827
Yeah, and you want to be...
an engineer?

25
00:04:36,107 --> 00:04:38,347
You don't even know how to steal.

26
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:45,987
Go on, eat.

27
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:52,707
Well, I'm outta here.

28
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:57,427
Wait for me!

29
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,907
What a creepy party!

30
00:05:56,947 --> 00:05:59,187
Let's put some
alcohol in here...

31
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,307
Let's go in.

32
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:21,907
- Ibra, they're beating up Sayid!
- Who?

33
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:24,187
Some brats.
Fuck, let's go!

34
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:46,787
What's wrong with you, man?

35
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:49,147
Break it up.

36
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,027
Get out!

37
00:06:59,747 --> 00:07:00,867
What's your problem?

38
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:02,683
What are you doing defending
the fucking Arabs?

39
00:07:02,707 --> 00:07:04,467
You always have
to start a fight, asshole!

40
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:07,467
Rafa, where're you going?

41
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:10,627
But you're coming to
the game tomorrow, right?

42
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:13,467
Boo!

43
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:14,707
Asshole!

44
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:17,827
- You know what?
- What?

45
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,187
Saturday is Rashid's birthday.

46
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:21,067
Really?

47
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,387
- Yeah.
- Are we gonna have a party?

48
00:07:24,147 --> 00:07:27,907
Jose said that if we behave
he'll let us get in later.

49
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,427
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

50
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:32,907
As long as we get
out to party...

51
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:35,707
Clean up because we'll have
to find you a girl.

52
00:07:56,427 --> 00:07:59,827
- Good night Ibra.
- Good night.

53
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,347
Shit!

54
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,707
So you overslept too?

55
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:03,107
Nah man, but I wasn't going to
get up

56
00:09:03,147 --> 00:09:05,227
just for two hours of Maths.

57
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:06,987
What's with this joint, bastard?

58
00:09:07,027 --> 00:09:07,947
You're smoking.

59
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:09,387
You bitch.

60
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:12,267
Here, no way you're
beating me today.

61
00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:14,747
Really? You're stoned,
can't even see the buttons.

62
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:18,987
We begin from below, slowly...

63
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:22,987
- You're not getting through.
- I'm not? Look.

64
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:25,907
This is gonna be a goal.
It's gonna be a goal!

65
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:30,427
You almost
broke my spine, bastard.

66
00:09:32,387 --> 00:09:34,507
Yellow, you're fucked.

67
00:09:36,187 --> 00:09:38,467
What are we doing on Saturday?

68
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,747
Javi didn't tell you?

69
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:45,347
He got tickets for the new club.

70
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:49,467
Which one?
The Sound? Cool.

71
00:09:51,987 --> 00:09:55,067
- You know who's going?
- Who?

72
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:58,707
A girl...

73
00:10:00,707 --> 00:10:02,947
- Who?
- A friend of yours.

74
00:10:04,227 --> 00:10:05,387
Who?

75
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:08,747
A really nice girl you know.

76
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:12,227
You know her really well.

77
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,187
You wanna tell me who's going,
man?

78
00:10:14,227 --> 00:10:15,307
Marta!

79
00:10:16,587 --> 00:10:19,227
- Goal!
- No!

80
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:20,827
You bastard!

81
00:10:22,947 --> 00:10:26,547
What a goal!
See? You can't beat me!

82
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:29,627
You're an ass, man.
What are you playing at?

83
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:34,707
Come in.

84
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:37,107
This is your home.

85
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:38,827
Come on.

86
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:42,187
Give me your rucksack.

87
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:48,547
Make yourself comfortable.

88
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:53,187
Who's this?

89
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:56,987
And what the fuck
do you care? Bigmouth!

90
00:10:58,387 --> 00:11:01,427
Guys... This is Ibra.
Ibra, the guys.

91
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:02,867
I'm gonna have some water.

92
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:04,147
Sit down, man.

93
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:06,707
How long are you staying for?

94
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,947
He'll stay for as long as he
wants!

95
00:11:08,987 --> 00:11:09,987
Like you all!

96
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:12,147
Get out of my sight!

97
00:11:12,747 --> 00:11:14,267
Bring me some water.

98
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:16,627
You, get up!

99
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:20,347
Sit down.
Don't pay any attention.

100
00:13:04,627 --> 00:13:06,947
What are you looking at?
Get outta here!

101
00:13:08,027 --> 00:13:09,707
It's OK.
It's OK.

102
00:13:38,587 --> 00:13:42,067
- What's up?
- Look at them.

103
00:13:42,107 --> 00:13:44,547
What's up?
Where have you been?

104
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:47,067
- Ask Rafa.
I beat him real bad.

105
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:49,307
Shut up, it was just a goal.

106
00:13:49,347 --> 00:13:51,787
- What a goal.
- Stop showing off...

107
00:13:51,827 --> 00:13:53,547
and let's see if you do
something

108
00:13:53,587 --> 00:13:54,707
on Saturday's game.

109
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:58,027
Guess who had an exam

110
00:13:58,347 --> 00:14:00,947
while you were having fun?
- No way!

111
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:04,467
Yeah, the bitch gave
us a surprise math test.

112
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:07,043
And this "genius" here
squealed on us and told her...

113
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:09,707
that we had cheatsheets
and half the class got caught.

114
00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:10,987
What a bastard, man.

115
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:13,027
They're the bastards, not me.

116
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:14,707
They all had cheatsheets.
I had

117
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:16,267
the guts to squeal on them.

118
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:19,787
We complained so now
it won't count in the course

119
00:14:20,587 --> 00:14:23,427
- You're off the hook then.
- Yeah, we got lucky.

120
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:32,427
What's up, you?
What are you looking at?

121
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:33,787
Nothing.

122
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:35,827
They're hot, don't you think?

123
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:36,747
Who?

124
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:39,267
What do you mean, who?
All of them!

125
00:14:39,307 --> 00:14:42,067
Don't worry you little rascal,
Marta is all yours.

126
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:43,987
Shut up, don't talk bullshit.

127
00:14:44,027 --> 00:14:45,067
No bullshit.

128
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:47,387
The other day she asked
me for your phone number.

129
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:48,683
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah.

130
00:14:48,707 --> 00:14:50,787
- And you gave it to her?
- Of course.

131
00:14:50,827 --> 00:14:52,787
So if you don't hit on her
on Saturday, I will.

132
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,627
I saw you checking out Lore
before.

133
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,467
The bitch's freaking hot!

134
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:01,987
I don't feel like
practicing right now.

135
00:15:03,507 --> 00:15:05,147
But you need it, bastard.

136
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:06,787
- Me?
- Take a look at this!

137
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:42,227
- Can you scan that for me?
- Hello.

138
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:44,307
How come you're so late?

139
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:46,067
What do you mean so late?

140
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:47,707
Forget it, go on inside,
you're late.

141
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,907
In Morocco it's an hour
earlier, so...

142
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:53,507
And in Spain, there's
a lot of superstition...

143
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:56,867
For example, Ibra,
since you were late...

144
00:15:57,267 --> 00:15:59,627
what kind of superstition
do you have in your country?

145
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,147
In my country?
- Yes.

146
00:16:02,747 --> 00:16:05,667
I don't know.
- Come on, there must be some.

147
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:10,107
I can't think of any.
- Really?

148
00:16:10,507 --> 00:16:12,187
And what about that
pendant you're wearing?

149
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:14,867
It seems related
to superstition.

150
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:18,187
No, it's a friendship charm.

151
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:20,787
Well, that is also a
form of superstition.

152
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:24,427
Teacher, how do you
spell "suprestrition?"

153
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:27,587
It's not "suprestrition."

154
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:52,107
The coach is an asshole.

155
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:55,307
If he had to swim all
that he'd kick it.

156
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,307
- You betcha.
- Geez, he made us swim.

157
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:05,427
Fuck, these keys seem
to be hiding.

158
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,307
Like you with Marta.

159
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:14,747
Why do you get so nervous
when we talk about that?

160
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:17,987
It's just...
I'm not in love...

161
00:17:18,027 --> 00:17:20,867
or anything like that, you know?

162
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:23,507
You're not gonna marry her
or anything.

163
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:27,067
Look, when I was with Lore,

164
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:30,067
it's not that I
didn't like her but...

165
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:32,507
She had great tits.

166
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:36,627
Yeah, sure, but
at least you knew how to...

167
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:41,347
Make out?
That's nothing.

168
00:17:42,587 --> 00:17:46,187
You stick in your tongue...
and forget about it.

169
00:17:47,907 --> 00:17:52,027
You could practice
in front of the mirror...

170
00:17:52,307 --> 00:17:55,347
tonight, but really,
it will just flow.

171
00:17:55,627 --> 00:17:59,187
- In front of the mirror?
- Yep, in front of the mirror.

172
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:01,707
OK.

173
00:18:02,187 --> 00:18:03,987
Gotta go,
they'll kill me if I don't.

174
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:06,307
- Will you be online later?
- Yeah, sure.

175
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:08,307
See you later.

176
00:18:19,747 --> 00:18:22,947
Hi cutie! R u going
to the disco 2morrow?

177
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:32,827
I guess so...

178
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:35,027
Dinner is ready!

179
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:43,987
(I'll go... hope 2 c u there!
Kisses ;)

180
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,547
- Don't you hear me? Dinner!
- Fuck, wait a minute!

181
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:55,547
Rafa, please.

182
00:18:57,627 --> 00:19:00,027
Fuck, mom, you're so annoying...

183
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:01,547
Yo!
Wait up!

184
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:07,387
- Wait up!
- What do you want?

185
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:10,387
I don't know.
I just wanted to apologize.

186
00:19:10,427 --> 00:19:11,427
For what?

187
00:19:11,587 --> 00:19:13,267
For your eye.

188
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:16,227
It doesn't matter.

189
00:19:16,587 --> 00:19:19,707
And well, I'm sorry
about the game too.

190
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:22,907
I wish you'd have broken
Javi's nose.

191
00:19:22,947 --> 00:19:25,547
- He's a bigmouth.
- Whatever.

192
00:21:42,747 --> 00:21:44,147
My name's Rafa.

193
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,427
I don't smoke.

194
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:57,627
Well, I do joints, but very
little.

195
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:59,307
You should give it a go.

196
00:22:25,947 --> 00:22:28,187
I told you I don't
usually smoke.

197
00:22:46,547 --> 00:22:48,387
Let's see if you can hit it.

198
00:22:49,507 --> 00:22:51,827
- No shit, it's really easy.
- Try.

199
00:23:32,987 --> 00:23:35,027
Who was that at the stands?

200
00:23:39,787 --> 00:23:41,147
My dad.

201
00:23:42,347 --> 00:23:45,587
Yeah, he's like a
fifty-year-old Javi.

202
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:47,827
He's a dickhead.

203
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,467
Why didn't you leave with him?

204
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:53,627
Didn't you hear him?

205
00:23:54,587 --> 00:23:56,467
No one can stand him.

206
00:24:03,787 --> 00:24:06,747
And you? Why didn't you
leave with your friends?

207
00:24:09,387 --> 00:24:12,467
I have no friends.
I'm better off alone.

208
00:24:50,707 --> 00:24:53,547
Rafa, it's Guille.
He says you should go now.

209
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,147
Tell him I'm coming.

210
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:58,867
Look at him. What's up?

211
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:01,067
And that bike?
What's that?

212
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:02,187
I didn't want to walk

213
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:03,787
so I stole the first
thing I found.

214
00:25:03,827 --> 00:25:06,027
Couldn't you
steal anything better?

215
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:09,787
Man, I didn't go into a store
asking for technical details.

216
00:25:09,827 --> 00:25:11,547
I stole the first thing I saw.

217
00:25:11,587 --> 00:25:13,067
But stealing that, man...

218
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:15,627
You shut up, dogface!
You don't even have the balls

219
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:17,787
to steal a lollipop
at the convenience store.

220
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:20,627
It's a really smooth ride.

221
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:23,387
You are the faggot who
likes to get it from behind.

222
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:30,907
So, are you gonna fuck
a girl tonight or what?

223
00:25:31,347 --> 00:25:32,587
Sure I am.

224
00:25:32,627 --> 00:25:35,187
Well, considering how
ugly you are, son of a bitch.

225
00:25:35,227 --> 00:25:37,827
I'm gonna pull it off
as soon as I get there.

226
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:39,547
You may try,
but you're not getting Lore.

227
00:25:39,907 --> 00:25:42,867
Of course I will. Her pussy
is like this because of me.

228
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:46,107
What the hell are
you gonna do with Lore?

229
00:25:46,787 --> 00:25:48,227
She'll suck me off.

230
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:50,907
Sure. I bet you
anything she won't.

231
00:25:50,947 --> 00:25:54,507
I did your mom and
you said I wouldn't.

232
00:25:55,547 --> 00:25:57,667
He's so obsessed with mothers.

233
00:25:57,707 --> 00:25:59,427
Yours drives me crazy.

234
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:02,547
- Let's go.
- Come on, let's go.

235
00:26:02,587 --> 00:26:05,147
- What about the bike?
- It's yours for ten euros.

236
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,227
But where are we going?

237
00:27:07,747 --> 00:27:11,267
- I told you, to the pharmacy.
- But... What for?

238
00:27:11,307 --> 00:27:13,627
When we go in, do as I told you.

239
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:16,147
But what do I have to ask?

240
00:27:16,587 --> 00:27:18,787
You just get in and do it.

241
00:27:20,187 --> 00:27:23,667
- But what do I tell them?
- Just do as I told you!

242
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,627
Come on!

243
00:27:33,227 --> 00:27:35,747
- Hello. How may I help you?
- Do you have any Elotinol?

244
00:27:36,227 --> 00:27:37,707
- What?
- Elotinol.

245
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:40,387
No, it doesn't ring
a bell. Let me see.

246
00:27:42,867 --> 00:27:45,707
No, there's nothing in
here under that name.

247
00:27:46,547 --> 00:27:48,747
Are you sure that's the name?

248
00:27:48,787 --> 00:27:49,267
Yes.

249
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,507
I'm gonna ask...

250
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:54,187
Who?

251
00:27:55,427 --> 00:27:56,987
Who are you going to ask?

252
00:27:58,267 --> 00:28:00,187
I've made a mistake.

253
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,427
There's work to do!

254
00:28:11,467 --> 00:28:12,827
What do you mean work?

255
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:14,667
Work, yes, work.

256
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:16,907
Thanks for ditching me!

257
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:18,507
You did really well!

258
00:28:19,267 --> 00:28:21,147
I didn't think you
had it in you!

259
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:22,787
Why?

260
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,107
Do you see all those lazy asses?

261
00:28:24,347 --> 00:28:26,507
None of them got it
right the first time.

262
00:28:27,547 --> 00:28:29,067
You're ready.

263
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,987
- What do you mean I'm ready?
- You'll see.

264
00:28:31,347 --> 00:28:33,867
- Let's go, guys!
- Get the merchandise.

265
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:35,547
Let's go!

266
00:28:43,027 --> 00:28:44,187
Wait!

267
00:28:44,227 --> 00:28:47,267
What you saw the other day,
stays between you and me.

268
00:28:47,307 --> 00:28:48,907
My brother doesn't like people.

269
00:28:49,387 --> 00:28:51,427
I'm gonna get him outta this
shitty country

270
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:52,467
as soon as I can.

271
00:28:52,507 --> 00:28:53,707
Where are you gonna take him?

272
00:28:54,027 --> 00:28:58,147
I'm not sure, but
very far away from here.

273
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:00,907
Come on, let's go.

274
00:30:01,907 --> 00:30:04,707
Those are the highways
out of this misery.

275
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:08,947
But first, you know
what we gotta do.

276
00:30:22,507 --> 00:30:24,667
Today is really easy going.

277
00:30:25,107 --> 00:30:26,627
It's gonna be a piece of
cake for you.

278
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:27,667
What?

279
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:29,787
- Me?
- Of course.

280
00:30:30,227 --> 00:30:31,507
It's really easy.

281
00:30:31,907 --> 00:30:34,187
Come on, stop shivering!
Look.

282
00:30:34,747 --> 00:30:36,787
All clear.

283
00:30:39,027 --> 00:30:41,067
There is your first costumer.

284
00:30:42,027 --> 00:30:44,987
Take this.
And keep your eyes open.

285
00:30:47,507 --> 00:30:48,787
Come on, go!

286
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:51,067
I'll watch you from here.

287
00:31:05,027 --> 00:31:06,267
Fuck!

288
00:31:06,507 --> 00:31:08,347
You're so clumsy!

289
00:31:09,027 --> 00:31:10,227
It's alright, man.

290
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:12,427
Give it to me.

291
00:31:14,787 --> 00:31:17,027
You need to do things with care.

292
00:31:18,227 --> 00:31:19,267
See?

293
00:31:19,987 --> 00:31:22,427
Just strength won't do.

294
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:27,067
There you go.
Just put a thread on it

295
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:28,627
and you have your charm.

296
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:34,227
OK guys, pick up the tools
and clean everything up.

297
00:31:34,947 --> 00:31:37,547
And I'll see you
tomorrow at five, alright?

298
00:31:48,547 --> 00:31:50,387
What are you doing
hanging out here?

299
00:31:50,427 --> 00:31:52,547
- Can't we just hang?
- No.

300
00:31:54,227 --> 00:31:56,227
And what are
those sports bags for?

301
00:31:56,947 --> 00:31:58,747
To practice sports, what else?

302
00:31:59,907 --> 00:32:02,587
- Come on, ID.
- We haven't done anything.

303
00:32:02,627 --> 00:32:04,187
You didn't hear me, did you?

304
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:12,107
We're here for one reason!
We have a game tomorrow.

305
00:32:12,707 --> 00:32:13,667
You're late!

306
00:32:13,707 --> 00:32:14,907
We got stopped by the police.

307
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,427
Get in the pool,
we've already started.

308
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:21,467
And you know who's
gotta stay to clean up.

309
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:36,827
- Look who just arrived.
- What?

310
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:39,507
Look who just arrived.

311
00:32:40,747 --> 00:32:43,187
Look who's there.
Are you gonna fuck her?

312
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,443
See how she's looking at you.
She wants something.

313
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:47,587
What do you know?

314
00:32:47,627 --> 00:32:48,763
How many have you made out with?

315
00:32:48,787 --> 00:32:49,547
None.

316
00:32:49,587 --> 00:32:50,827
Shut up then!

317
00:32:51,267 --> 00:32:53,827
- Go get her.
- Yeah, he's right.

318
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:56,107
Don't be a pussy and
get over there.

319
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:58,307
Come on! Come on!

320
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:04,427
- Hi.
- Hi.

321
00:33:04,707 --> 00:33:06,187
Come on!

322
00:33:11,747 --> 00:33:14,507
There's quite a crowd here
today.

323
00:33:14,547 --> 00:33:15,547
Yeah.

324
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:18,347
Come on! Fuck her, Rafa!

325
00:33:18,987 --> 00:33:20,147
Come on!

326
00:33:20,627 --> 00:33:22,427
Look, I just...

327
00:33:24,827 --> 00:33:26,387
I mean...

328
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:43,307
Look, I gotta go to the bathroom,

329
00:33:43,347 --> 00:33:44,347
I'll be right back.

330
00:33:44,787 --> 00:33:45,787
Alright.

331
00:33:52,707 --> 00:33:55,187
- Man, this is awesome!
- Yeah!

332
00:33:55,227 --> 00:33:56,507
There's loads of girls!

333
00:33:56,547 --> 00:33:58,187
Wait, I gotta go to the
bathroom.

334
00:33:58,227 --> 00:33:58,947
OK.

335
00:33:58,987 --> 00:34:00,227
Come on, let's go.

336
00:34:05,707 --> 00:34:07,347
What's that fucking Arab up to?

337
00:34:08,307 --> 00:34:09,827
What does it matter?
Leave him be.

338
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:11,867
Of course it matters.
He's all over Lore!

339
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:14,107
- Never mind.
- Get outta the way!

340
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,547
It's your fault!

341
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,547
Man, what do you want me to do?

342
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:27,347
She looked at me first!

343
00:34:27,387 --> 00:34:29,347
How do I know she was his girl?

344
00:34:29,707 --> 00:34:30,947
Besides...

345
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:34,187
whatever we do,
it's always our fault.

346
00:34:34,587 --> 00:34:36,347
If I get my hands on that
motherfucker

347
00:34:36,387 --> 00:34:37,507
I'll smash in his face!

348
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,987
Did the girls get
tired of you already?

349
00:34:41,267 --> 00:34:42,667
Do you smell so bad?

350
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:07,307
It's Sayd!

351
00:35:12,347 --> 00:35:14,107
Don't go, they'll take you too!

352
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:15,947
Let go of me!

353
00:35:20,347 --> 00:35:21,667
You're going to hurt them!

354
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:25,307
They're just kids!

355
00:35:25,347 --> 00:35:26,787
It's not your business!

356
00:35:27,587 --> 00:35:29,707
Come here!
Come on, get up!

357
00:35:33,387 --> 00:35:36,067
Aren't you ashamed?
They're just kids!

358
00:35:52,587 --> 00:35:54,267
Get up!

359
00:36:01,147 --> 00:36:03,267
What were you thinking, Jose?
You know

360
00:36:03,307 --> 00:36:05,467
what happens with the
inspections.

361
00:36:05,507 --> 00:36:06,827
They started hitting them.

362
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:08,987
And the worst part is that
you end up here.

363
00:36:09,027 --> 00:36:11,227
I tried to defend the kid.

364
00:36:11,267 --> 00:36:12,683
And who defends the ones at
the centre?

365
00:36:12,707 --> 00:36:14,267
They spent the whole night on
their own.

366
00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:28,947
Fasten your seatbelt.

367
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,307
And why did they take Sayd?

368
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:36,347
I don't know. They must
have alleged reunification.

369
00:36:36,387 --> 00:36:38,587
Reunification my ass!

370
00:36:38,627 --> 00:36:40,787
Sayd doesn't have
anyone in Morocco.

371
00:36:40,827 --> 00:36:43,867
It's just like always, they
find an uncle, grandpa,

372
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:46,067
someone who'll allegedly
take care of him.

373
00:36:46,107 --> 00:36:48,667
That's all they need.
It's illegal but it's enough.

374
00:36:49,147 --> 00:36:51,347
Will you fasten
your seatbelt, Ibra?

375
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:10,387
Rafa, you've been like this
the whole week. What's wrong?

376
00:37:17,787 --> 00:37:20,387
Hey, Guille, how nice to see
you.

377
00:37:20,427 --> 00:37:21,427
Come on in.

378
00:37:22,347 --> 00:37:24,787
Guess who's come to see you?

379
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:29,627
Fuck man, I know I'm not Megan
Fox,

380
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:30,907
but cheer up a little.

381
00:37:30,947 --> 00:37:32,987
Ignore him, Guille, he's been
like

382
00:37:33,027 --> 00:37:35,027
that since the holidays started.

383
00:37:35,507 --> 00:37:38,067
Take him out to get
some fresh air.

384
00:37:38,347 --> 00:37:40,507
Your mom, she's leaving
me to do the dirty work.

385
00:37:40,747 --> 00:37:41,987
What did you say?

386
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:44,707
Nothing, just if he
wanted to come to our place.

387
00:37:46,507 --> 00:37:47,667
The girls are coming.

388
00:37:47,987 --> 00:37:49,507
Girls?

389
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:52,547
- Who are those girls?
- Mom, drop it.

390
00:37:53,347 --> 00:37:55,467
So you picked up a girl?

391
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:59,227
Yeah, we're leaving.
Come on.

392
00:37:59,507 --> 00:38:01,747
If you want, I can
introduce them to you.

393
00:38:01,787 --> 00:38:03,987
They're really nice girls.

394
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,627
Look, he's on his own.

395
00:38:07,547 --> 00:38:09,747
What are you doing?
Fucking cheater!

396
00:38:12,147 --> 00:38:14,507
Here, take this.

397
00:38:20,267 --> 00:38:23,547
Yo, Rafita, did
your mommy let you go out?

398
00:38:25,147 --> 00:38:28,507
So, what about Marta?
Did you fuck her or what?

399
00:38:28,787 --> 00:38:29,827
Shut up man!

400
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:32,747
What's with you? Do you suck
his dick or what?

401
00:38:32,787 --> 00:38:35,027
Enough, man!
You wear me out.

402
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:36,507
Take it easy, kid.

403
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,027
Do you wanna play to relax a
little?

404
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,067
No way.

405
00:38:41,307 --> 00:38:42,947
If you're not gonna play,

406
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,147
go get me some pot
from the Arab.

407
00:38:45,747 --> 00:38:47,043
Seeing you're not
doing anything...

408
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:48,403
You shouldn't have smoked it
all, idiot.

409
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:49,387
Don't be a smartass or...

410
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:54,027
Or what!? Or what!?
What are you gonna do?

411
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:55,827
I'm gonna punch
this asshole's face in!

412
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:58,307
Let's go buy some pot
and forget about him.

413
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:01,307
At least I didn't drop
anything or

414
00:39:01,347 --> 00:39:02,667
I would've cut him up.

415
00:39:18,187 --> 00:39:20,987
- What do you want?
- Pot. You have any?

416
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,467
Wait here.

417
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:28,187
What do you think about
the fight at the "place?"

418
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:31,427
- I don't know. You know Javi.
- He's an asshole.

419
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:33,907
I would've punched him right
there.

420
00:39:33,947 --> 00:39:35,187
He's not worth it.

421
00:39:35,627 --> 00:39:38,387
- How much do you want?
- I don't know, 10 g?

422
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:41,507
Ibra!
Where were you?

423
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:43,467
I've been looking for
you the whole week.

424
00:39:43,947 --> 00:39:45,347
Do you know this guy?

425
00:39:45,387 --> 00:39:47,547
Nah, just from
seeing him around.

426
00:39:47,787 --> 00:39:50,867
- You wanna buy or not?
- Relax, man.

427
00:39:50,907 --> 00:39:52,827
- Hey don't touch me!
- Don't what?

428
00:39:52,867 --> 00:39:54,347
Hey, you!

429
00:39:56,467 --> 00:39:57,747
Are your positions clear?

430
00:39:57,787 --> 00:39:59,387
Careful not to lose the ball...

431
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:10,307
- Ready?
- Come on! Come on!

432
00:40:11,907 --> 00:40:14,107
Look at these idiots, they
must be great swimmers,

433
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:15,907
they all come on small boats...

434
00:40:16,187 --> 00:40:18,067
Is there a problem?

435
00:40:18,107 --> 00:40:19,347
Fuck! Enough!

436
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:21,467
Didn't you have
enough yesterday?

437
00:40:21,507 --> 00:40:23,507
- He started it.
- Let's just play.

438
00:40:27,867 --> 00:40:29,427
Shut your trap.

439
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:31,067
You're an asshole!

440
00:40:32,827 --> 00:40:35,267
Fuck, don't pay any attention.
You should have hit them.

441
00:41:44,107 --> 00:41:45,107
Goal!

442
00:41:55,467 --> 00:41:56,467
Fucking Arab!

443
00:41:58,667 --> 00:41:59,627
Bastard!

444
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:00,803
That color looks good on your
eye.

445
00:42:00,827 --> 00:42:02,467
You want me to match you the
other one?

446
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,547
Don't let those
shitheads scare you!

447
00:42:12,587 --> 00:42:14,147
You're a dickhead!

448
00:42:18,027 --> 00:42:19,147
Don't you think?

449
00:42:19,187 --> 00:42:21,467
Are you sure your head
is screwed on?

450
00:42:33,947 --> 00:42:35,667
What a goal!

451
00:42:44,027 --> 00:42:45,947
What a goal yours, eh!

452
00:42:46,467 --> 00:42:49,547
Like it wasn't easy,
they had a great goalie.

453
00:42:50,107 --> 00:42:51,947
You take after your father.

454
00:42:52,307 --> 00:42:54,067
You've got a steady hand.

455
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:58,227
Concentration, that's
the most important thing.

456
00:42:59,787 --> 00:43:00,947
Stop! Stop! Stop!

457
00:43:01,227 --> 00:43:03,067
- Stop, fuck, stop!
- Why?

458
00:43:05,907 --> 00:43:07,467
Nothing, I forgot my cap.

459
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:09,267
Go in and we'll wait for you.

460
00:43:09,307 --> 00:43:10,667
That's alright, I'll hike.

461
00:43:10,947 --> 00:43:12,547
You're not coming with us?

462
00:43:12,587 --> 00:43:14,067
What for?
We haven't won anything yet.

463
00:43:14,187 --> 00:43:15,227
Come on, go!

464
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:17,707
You're such a sourpuss.

465
00:43:18,147 --> 00:43:20,107
We'll celebrate without him.

466
00:43:30,387 --> 00:43:31,787
Yo, wait up!

467
00:43:41,507 --> 00:43:43,227
Aren't you coming to the Mac?

468
00:43:44,347 --> 00:43:47,307
Well... I don't
have any dough and...

469
00:43:48,067 --> 00:43:49,387
I could pay...

470
00:43:50,307 --> 00:43:54,027
Well, I gotta help my
mom with some stuff so...

471
00:43:55,547 --> 00:43:59,227
- We could meet tomorrow.
- Whatever.

472
00:44:47,787 --> 00:44:49,147
Hello, good morning.

473
00:44:50,227 --> 00:44:51,587
Do you know if
Ibrahim is around?

474
00:44:51,907 --> 00:44:54,947
Do you know how many Ibrahims
there are

475
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:56,347
in a centre like this?

476
00:44:56,707 --> 00:44:58,267
He's a boy...

477
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:01,507
tall... Fifteen or
sixteen years old.

478
00:45:01,547 --> 00:45:03,387
- He's not in.
- Are you sure?

479
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:05,507
He's not in, are you deaf?

480
00:45:05,547 --> 00:45:07,387
Screw you!

481
00:45:41,547 --> 00:45:43,587
Get inside, I'll be
right with you.

482
00:45:46,427 --> 00:45:47,787
What are you doing here?

483
00:45:48,427 --> 00:45:50,827
Waiting for you.

484
00:45:52,427 --> 00:45:54,347
You don't have any
friends, do you?

485
00:46:12,627 --> 00:46:14,267
What are they doing?

486
00:46:16,587 --> 00:46:20,027
I don't know, some kind
of weird bowling game.

487
00:46:24,987 --> 00:46:26,467
And you don't play?

488
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:30,347
Nah. Besides you
play in pairs.

489
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:32,227
And I already told you
I have no friends.

490
00:46:34,187 --> 00:46:36,107
The thing is he's got no balls.

491
00:46:41,627 --> 00:46:43,067
How's your targeting?

492
00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:44,667
I don't know.

493
00:46:44,707 --> 00:46:46,587
Ask your goalie, he should know.

494
00:46:52,307 --> 00:46:54,827
- You coming or what?
- I'm not allowed.

495
00:46:55,227 --> 00:46:56,747
You see any guards?

496
00:46:57,947 --> 00:46:59,307
Come on.

497
00:47:02,107 --> 00:47:03,427
Come on.

498
00:47:45,627 --> 00:47:49,227
Rafa! Wait!
You got out really fast.

499
00:47:49,707 --> 00:47:51,307
Nah man. As usual.

500
00:47:51,587 --> 00:47:54,707
Yesterday I called your cell a
bunch of times

501
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,347
and you didn't answer.

502
00:47:57,187 --> 00:48:00,307
I told you I had to
help my mom and stuff.

503
00:48:01,347 --> 00:48:03,987
- The whole afternoon?
- Yeah.

504
00:48:26,707 --> 00:48:28,387
Do you have a problem with me?

505
00:48:30,027 --> 00:48:31,587
No, why?

506
00:48:32,347 --> 00:48:35,427
I don't know, you've been
acting weird lately.

507
00:48:37,587 --> 00:48:39,667
I'm just...

508
00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:42,987
tired of always
doing the same stuff.

509
00:48:44,267 --> 00:48:45,387
I see.

510
00:49:01,587 --> 00:49:03,467
The other day Marta asked me

511
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:05,587
if you wanted to hang out again.

512
00:49:06,307 --> 00:49:07,667
Look, Guille...

513
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:10,467
I...

514
00:49:12,027 --> 00:49:13,307
well...

515
00:49:17,027 --> 00:49:18,547
I don't like Marta.

516
00:49:19,107 --> 00:49:20,347
Why?

517
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:24,307
I just don't...

518
00:49:27,187 --> 00:49:28,547
Forget it, man.

519
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:32,867
Take it easy...
No need to explain.

520
00:49:33,787 --> 00:49:35,187
Thanks.

521
00:49:39,627 --> 00:49:41,827
Doesn't your aunt work
at the bowling alley?

522
00:49:44,867 --> 00:49:46,947
I don't understand why you're
coming.

523
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:48,827
Because I want to.
What else?

524
00:49:48,867 --> 00:49:52,227
- You don't have any friends.
- What!? Get inside!

525
00:49:54,387 --> 00:49:56,187
- Hello.
- Hello.

526
00:49:56,707 --> 00:49:59,507
If it isn't the tournament's
most sporting player!

527
00:49:59,987 --> 00:50:02,867
- Stop kidding me.
- Introduce your friend to us.

528
00:50:04,107 --> 00:50:06,147
- Elisa, Alicia... Rafa.
- Hello.

529
00:50:07,707 --> 00:50:09,827
You scored the penalty, right?

530
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:14,867
Relax, man, it's alright.

531
00:50:14,907 --> 00:50:16,467
Did you bring what I asked for?

532
00:50:16,507 --> 00:50:18,587
Yes, here it is.

533
00:50:20,827 --> 00:50:22,067
How long will it take?

534
00:50:22,107 --> 00:50:25,067
Your paperwork?
It shouldn't take longer than

535
00:50:25,107 --> 00:50:26,307
the summer.

536
00:50:26,787 --> 00:50:27,803
Taking into account you've been

537
00:50:27,827 --> 00:50:28,947
in Spain almost three years.

538
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:30,827
I've been here
longer and you know it.

539
00:50:31,147 --> 00:50:33,627
And you also know that
for them, those don't count.

540
00:50:34,987 --> 00:50:36,227
Here, two copies.

541
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:37,923
Besides, after what happened
the other day,

542
00:50:37,947 --> 00:50:39,267
I don't know how they'll react.

543
00:50:39,507 --> 00:50:41,467
Did you expect me to
let them take Sayd?

544
00:50:41,987 --> 00:50:44,667
Don't be like that,
it's not my fault.

545
00:50:45,227 --> 00:50:46,707
What happened to Sayd

546
00:50:46,747 --> 00:50:48,123
was a low blow from
the DA's Office.

547
00:50:48,147 --> 00:50:50,147
But you know that they must
notify

548
00:50:50,187 --> 00:50:52,187
by post before they intervene.

549
00:50:52,227 --> 00:50:54,067
- Wait, I don't get it.
- What?

550
00:50:54,307 --> 00:50:55,987
If they're alright here...

551
00:50:56,227 --> 00:50:58,163
Why do they take them back to
their countries where they

552
00:50:58,187 --> 00:50:59,187
don't have anything?

553
00:50:59,427 --> 00:51:01,067
I just don't get it.

554
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:10,307
Come on, man, you heard Alicia.

555
00:51:10,347 --> 00:51:11,987
Everything's gonna be OK.

556
00:51:22,307 --> 00:51:23,507
Hey, so...

557
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,467
I forgot to ask you something.

558
00:51:27,587 --> 00:51:29,827
How's your targeting?

559
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,267
Come here, bastard!

560
00:52:02,947 --> 00:52:05,107
Good thing you paid
because I'm flat broke.

561
00:52:05,787 --> 00:52:07,627
Eat, you need your strength.

562
00:52:08,427 --> 00:52:09,747
What for?

563
00:52:09,787 --> 00:52:11,987
I remind you,
you're losing, Mr. Precision.

564
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:13,347
Precision?

565
00:52:14,027 --> 00:52:15,987
Here's precision for you!

566
00:54:37,747 --> 00:54:39,227
Take this.

567
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:45,267
What for?

568
00:54:46,827 --> 00:54:48,787
Look, they're two pieces.

569
00:54:49,907 --> 00:54:52,187
They have to always be together.

570
00:54:52,507 --> 00:54:54,547
If they ever get separated...

571
00:54:55,147 --> 00:54:58,467
you gotta do whatever it takes
to get them back together.

572
00:54:58,787 --> 00:55:00,267
Or what?

573
00:55:00,307 --> 00:55:02,867
Or nothing, wacko,
it's a metaphor.

574
00:55:48,707 --> 00:55:52,427
- I get off here.
- So...

575
00:55:52,787 --> 00:55:54,307
Do you wanna meet tomorrow

576
00:55:54,347 --> 00:55:56,507
to throw some ball at the pool?

577
00:55:57,907 --> 00:56:00,947
- OK, at five?
- Good.

578
00:56:01,547 --> 00:56:02,763
Bring a pen and a notebook
because

579
00:56:02,787 --> 00:56:04,067
I'm gonna teach you how to play.

580
00:56:04,107 --> 00:56:05,587
Just go home.

581
00:56:55,027 --> 00:56:57,427
Hey, the disappeared one!

582
00:56:57,707 --> 00:56:59,707
Where have you been, bastard?

583
00:56:59,747 --> 00:57:01,427
Around.

584
00:57:03,107 --> 00:57:04,627
I was with Chete the other day,

585
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:05,827
smoking and stuff...

586
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:07,203
and he told me you were
with an Arab

587
00:57:07,227 --> 00:57:08,307
at the bowling alley...

588
00:57:08,347 --> 00:57:10,227
really close and shit.

589
00:57:10,267 --> 00:57:12,107
Tell Chete he's a dickhead...

590
00:57:12,347 --> 00:57:13,947
and that I'm fucking
tired of him.

591
00:57:13,987 --> 00:57:16,267
I've been helping my mom
the whole fucking weekend.

592
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,987
You sure you don't like...?
- For sure.

593
00:57:18,027 --> 00:57:20,467
He knows I don't hang with
fucking Arabs.

594
00:57:20,507 --> 00:57:21,747
Ok, if you say so.

595
00:57:22,587 --> 00:57:24,747
We're going to the pool, wanna
come?

596
00:57:24,787 --> 00:57:25,227
Sure.

597
00:57:25,467 --> 00:57:28,307
- Yeah, sure.
- Come on, let's go.

598
00:57:42,147 --> 00:57:43,307
Hello...

599
00:57:44,347 --> 00:57:45,707
have you seen Ibra?

600
00:57:46,227 --> 00:57:47,947
No, I haven't seen him all day.

601
00:57:47,987 --> 00:57:49,947
I was supposed to meet him at
the pool,

602
00:57:49,987 --> 00:57:51,627
but he didn't show up.

603
00:57:52,787 --> 00:57:54,347
I don't know...

604
00:57:54,867 --> 00:57:56,427
Is he looking for Ibra?

605
00:57:56,467 --> 00:57:58,907
- Have you seen him?
- Ibra is not home, he split.

606
00:57:58,947 --> 00:58:00,387
What are you on about?

607
00:58:00,427 --> 00:58:02,267
If you don't believe me
go check for yourself.

608
00:58:02,307 --> 00:58:03,907
His locker is empty.

609
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:18,987
- What's this?
- Fuck!

610
00:58:22,227 --> 00:58:23,467
- Can we come in?
- Yes.

611
00:58:23,507 --> 00:58:24,507
Come in.

612
00:58:25,347 --> 00:58:26,987
- Hey, Jose.
- Is Alicia in?

613
00:58:27,027 --> 00:58:28,867
Yes, she's in a
meeting in her office.

614
00:58:29,147 --> 00:58:31,307
- Is it gonna take long?
- I think so.

615
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:33,987
- Well, we'll wait.
- No fucking way!

616
00:58:35,907 --> 00:58:37,947
Alicia, I need your help!

617
00:58:38,467 --> 00:58:39,507
What's going on?

618
00:58:39,547 --> 00:58:41,267
I'm sorry Alicia, I tried
to stop him but...

619
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:43,747
Gabriel, do you mind
waiting outside, please?

620
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:45,587
Thank you, and excuse all this.

621
00:58:45,987 --> 00:58:49,227
- They wanna take Ibra.
- What do you mean?

622
00:58:51,387 --> 00:58:52,787
He got this letter last night.

623
00:59:00,867 --> 00:59:02,147
Again?

624
00:59:02,187 --> 00:59:03,827
A reunification?

625
00:59:03,867 --> 00:59:05,907
Ibra doesn't have anyone there!

626
00:59:05,947 --> 00:59:06,507
I know.

627
00:59:06,787 --> 00:59:07,867
Let's calm down.

628
00:59:07,907 --> 00:59:09,187
First things first,
where's Ibra?

629
00:59:10,907 --> 00:59:12,347
Jose?

630
00:59:12,627 --> 00:59:15,587
- He's not here. He left.
- Fuck, Jose!

631
00:59:15,947 --> 00:59:19,547
What the fuck are
night rounds for?

632
00:59:20,667 --> 00:59:22,107
Jose...

633
00:59:22,147 --> 00:59:25,347
call police stations and
hospitals.

634
00:59:25,827 --> 00:59:28,027
Elisa, call the Department of
Interior,

635
00:59:28,067 --> 00:59:30,507
fool them, ask for paperwork,
whatever.

636
00:59:30,547 --> 00:59:31,787
And what do I do?

637
00:59:32,107 --> 00:59:34,907
- You are his friend, right?
- Yes.

638
00:59:35,387 --> 00:59:37,907
Where do you think
he might have gone?

639
01:01:07,987 --> 01:01:09,667
Hey you, stop!

640
01:01:10,787 --> 01:01:12,363
Don't throw it away,
Youssef will kill you!

641
01:01:12,387 --> 01:01:13,547
Rafa, don't go that way!

642
01:01:22,947 --> 01:01:24,547
- Hey, wait up!
- Don't touch me!

643
01:01:24,867 --> 01:01:27,147
What's wrong?
I thought we were friends.

644
01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:29,867
So did I, but friends
don't ditch each other.

645
01:01:29,907 --> 01:01:31,827
I didn't ditch you.

646
01:01:32,347 --> 01:01:35,187
Don't play dumb,
I heard what you told Javi.

647
01:01:39,067 --> 01:01:40,347
I'm sorry.

648
01:01:40,387 --> 01:01:41,947
I didn't know what to say.

649
01:01:42,827 --> 01:01:43,987
- And...
- Leave it!

650
01:01:44,027 --> 01:01:45,347
No man, really...

651
01:01:45,387 --> 01:01:48,107
I'm not like the others.
I care about you.

652
01:01:52,347 --> 01:01:54,227
I'm apologizing, if I didn't
care

653
01:01:54,267 --> 01:01:55,387
I wouldn't be here.

654
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:58,907
Anyway...

655
01:01:58,947 --> 01:02:00,307
I don't have anywhere to go,

656
01:02:00,347 --> 01:02:02,267
and if Yousef finds me,
he'll kill me.

657
01:02:05,427 --> 01:02:07,787
I know where you can
hide for a few days.

658
01:02:10,107 --> 01:02:11,827
Do you trust me?

659
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:21,467
Where are you taking that bag?

660
01:02:21,507 --> 01:02:22,507
Practice.

661
01:02:22,547 --> 01:02:24,707
Don't you get a break on that
team?

662
01:02:24,747 --> 01:02:26,307
They're exploiting us.

663
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:34,027
Ibra?

664
01:02:37,187 --> 01:02:38,987
What are you doing there?

665
01:02:40,467 --> 01:02:41,827
I thought you weren't coming.

666
01:02:41,867 --> 01:02:43,427
What were you doing there, man?

667
01:02:43,867 --> 01:02:45,347
Hiding.

668
01:02:45,707 --> 01:02:46,827
Why?

669
01:02:46,867 --> 01:02:49,507
- In case someone comes.
- I told you nobody would.

670
01:02:49,827 --> 01:02:52,907
- I don't know. What's this?
- Food.

671
01:02:56,427 --> 01:02:58,467
Go on, eat.

672
01:03:10,587 --> 01:03:12,907
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

673
01:03:17,227 --> 01:03:20,347
You don't know what
you're in for!

674
01:03:34,587 --> 01:03:36,347
You fucker!

675
01:03:56,987 --> 01:03:59,307
Now what?
Are you going to kiss me?

676
01:04:03,267 --> 01:04:07,027
Fuck, what a scene!

677
01:04:07,067 --> 01:04:08,707
Your asshole must be wider
than your neck.

678
01:04:09,707 --> 01:04:12,427
Apart from being a
loser, he's a pillow biter.

679
01:04:12,467 --> 01:04:13,747
And with a fucking Arab.

680
01:04:13,787 --> 01:04:15,387
This guy could infect you
with anything.

681
01:04:15,427 --> 01:04:17,507
At least do it with someone
of our own species.

682
01:04:17,547 --> 01:04:19,107
Ain't that right, Guille?

683
01:04:19,987 --> 01:04:22,227
Get outta here, I don't
wanna see no faggot shit.

684
01:04:22,267 --> 01:04:24,547
What if I don't wanna leave?
What's gonna happen?

685
01:04:24,787 --> 01:04:27,107
What's gonna happen if
I don't leave,

686
01:04:27,147 --> 01:04:28,947
you fucking moron?

687
01:04:33,267 --> 01:04:35,147
Asshole!

688
01:04:58,947 --> 01:05:00,627
Your friends are a bunch of
retards,

689
01:05:00,667 --> 01:05:01,707
you know that, right?

690
01:05:04,147 --> 01:05:05,747
Guille is my friend.

691
01:05:05,787 --> 01:05:07,947
You could have fooled me!

692
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:15,267
What's that?

693
01:05:16,867 --> 01:05:18,867
The fair!

694
01:06:14,027 --> 01:06:16,147
- Ibrahim!
- Where is my money?

695
01:06:24,187 --> 01:06:25,587
Ibrahim!

696
01:06:56,747 --> 01:06:58,187
Wait.

697
01:07:04,547 --> 01:07:07,307
I can clean it up at
home if you want.

698
01:07:11,347 --> 01:07:13,427
No one's home,
they're out for dinner.

699
01:07:16,067 --> 01:07:18,027
Come on, don't be stupid,
it's gonna get infected.

700
01:07:20,147 --> 01:07:21,547
Come on, let's go.

701
01:07:34,907 --> 01:07:37,907
My mom got them when I was
four and they're still here.

702
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:48,187
You're gonna have
to take them off.

703
01:07:49,187 --> 01:07:51,387
Relax, I'm not gonna rape you.

704
01:08:23,267 --> 01:08:25,467
- Does it sting?
- A bit.

705
01:08:26,467 --> 01:08:28,907
Don't worry, that's
because it's healing.

706
01:09:13,267 --> 01:09:14,787
All done.

707
01:10:17,707 --> 01:10:19,427
What's wrong?

708
01:10:21,587 --> 01:10:24,387
They're kicking me out.
That's what's wrong.

709
01:10:39,547 --> 01:10:41,347
That's not sure yet.

710
01:10:43,227 --> 01:10:45,187
And what if it does happen?

711
01:10:50,507 --> 01:10:52,387
Don't get all worked up.

712
01:10:52,627 --> 01:10:54,387
It doesn't have to happen.

713
01:10:56,387 --> 01:10:58,427
Let's go see Alicia.

714
01:10:59,227 --> 01:11:01,227
I'm sure it will be OK.

715
01:11:11,307 --> 01:11:13,547
Are you gonna send
it by courier?

716
01:11:14,547 --> 01:11:16,947
Cash on delivery, of course.

717
01:11:17,667 --> 01:11:20,587
OK.
I'll call you. Bye.

718
01:11:20,827 --> 01:11:22,747
Look who's here!

719
01:11:22,787 --> 01:11:24,947
Ibra, how are you?

720
01:11:25,427 --> 01:11:27,907
- Good.
- Am I glad to see you!

721
01:11:27,947 --> 01:11:29,227
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

722
01:11:29,267 --> 01:11:31,267
Good job, Rafa.

723
01:11:31,307 --> 01:11:32,987
Alicia, I'm gonna
notify the police.

724
01:11:33,027 --> 01:11:34,667
What do you mean the police?

725
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,987
Elisa, we don't need to
call the police.

726
01:11:37,547 --> 01:11:39,267
Don't worry.

727
01:11:39,707 --> 01:11:41,667
Where have you been?

728
01:11:41,707 --> 01:11:43,427
- Around.
- Around?

729
01:11:43,987 --> 01:11:46,307
Don't worry about the letter,
Ibra.

730
01:11:46,347 --> 01:11:48,467
Everything's gonna be alright.

731
01:11:49,547 --> 01:11:51,067
Will you wait for me in the
classroom?

732
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:53,907
I've gotta finish something,
I'll be right with you.

733
01:12:18,747 --> 01:12:20,307
Look, Alicia...

734
01:12:20,347 --> 01:12:22,587
say what you want, but if we
don't report it,

735
01:12:22,627 --> 01:12:24,187
we're committing a felony.

736
01:12:24,227 --> 01:12:26,467
Don't you realize that
if you call the police,

737
01:12:26,507 --> 01:12:27,507
it's over?

738
01:12:27,587 --> 01:12:29,987
After they take him and before
they extradite him,

739
01:12:30,027 --> 01:12:30,867
we've got time.

740
01:12:30,907 --> 01:12:33,067
That's when we've got to act.

741
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:36,107
But we can't hide a minor who
received

742
01:12:36,147 --> 01:12:37,587
an extradition warrant.

743
01:12:43,747 --> 01:12:45,187
I'm gonna call.

744
01:12:53,867 --> 01:12:55,827
May I speak with González,
please?

745
01:12:55,867 --> 01:12:56,867
- Rafa?

746
01:12:58,227 --> 01:12:59,947
Do you need anything?

747
01:12:59,987 --> 01:13:02,787
No, I gotta pee and I don't
know where the bathroom is.

748
01:13:03,347 --> 01:13:06,787
- Down the hall on the right.
- OK, thanks.

749
01:13:07,027 --> 01:13:10,227
Yes. Ibrahim has returned.

750
01:13:15,227 --> 01:13:16,627
OK.

751
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:20,947
That's it.
They're on their way.

752
01:13:21,547 --> 01:13:24,107
And what do we tell the kid now?

753
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:26,867
Ibra is not here!

754
01:13:26,907 --> 01:13:29,227
- What!?
- He's not here, he split!

755
01:13:30,667 --> 01:13:32,427
Fuck.

756
01:13:55,747 --> 01:13:58,667
- What happened?
- They bought it.

757
01:13:58,907 --> 01:14:01,747
- Really? Don't fuck with me!
- They did!

758
01:14:02,507 --> 01:14:04,387
But how did you do it?

759
01:14:04,427 --> 01:14:06,867
They told me that it was
really late

760
01:14:06,907 --> 01:14:08,787
and that I better go home.

761
01:14:09,067 --> 01:14:10,707
And they believed you
with that face?

762
01:14:10,747 --> 01:14:12,507
Who do you think you are?

763
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:34,027
And now what?
Where do we go?

764
01:14:35,587 --> 01:14:37,307
I don't know.

765
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:40,627
But we can't go back
to my friends' place.

766
01:14:41,587 --> 01:14:43,507
I know.

767
01:14:53,787 --> 01:14:55,387
Who is it?

768
01:15:10,027 --> 01:15:12,627
- Hi.
- Hi.

769
01:15:15,507 --> 01:15:17,547
Where have you been?

770
01:15:17,587 --> 01:15:19,387
Around.

771
01:15:19,627 --> 01:15:20,907
Look...

772
01:15:22,827 --> 01:15:24,867
I need a favor.

773
01:15:25,947 --> 01:15:28,507
- Your mom is upstairs.
- What?

774
01:15:30,787 --> 01:15:32,347
And what did you tell her?

775
01:15:33,347 --> 01:15:35,747
Nothing, she just got here.

776
01:15:39,347 --> 01:15:41,507
We need a place
to spend the night.

777
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:48,747
- And your folks?
- They wouldn't understand.

778
01:15:50,147 --> 01:15:53,067
I have an idea,
but we gotta go now.

779
01:15:58,347 --> 01:16:02,027
- About before...
- Forget it, don't worry.

780
01:16:04,187 --> 01:16:06,747
I don't know if I understand
what you're doing...

781
01:16:07,267 --> 01:16:08,747
but...

782
01:16:12,227 --> 01:16:14,107
I feel bad.

783
01:16:15,027 --> 01:16:17,027
Can I help in any way?

784
01:16:17,067 --> 01:16:19,867
You can tell my mom not to
worry,

785
01:16:19,907 --> 01:16:21,467
that I'm alright.

786
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:24,067
I don't know, make something up.

787
01:16:41,667 --> 01:16:43,707
It's all I have.

788
01:16:51,947 --> 01:16:54,067
Thanks, man.

789
01:17:14,787 --> 01:17:16,707
We gotta go, man.

790
01:18:14,947 --> 01:18:16,427
Come on.

791
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:21,227
You wanna sleep indoors or not?

792
01:18:23,707 --> 01:18:25,387
Come on, trust me.

793
01:18:26,187 --> 01:18:27,987
Let's go.

794
01:19:58,787 --> 01:20:00,827
Cut it out, boy!

795
01:20:07,347 --> 01:20:08,827
Hey...

796
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:14,507
You never told me...

797
01:20:14,907 --> 01:20:16,387
What?

798
01:20:16,427 --> 01:20:18,387
How you got here.

799
01:20:23,987 --> 01:20:26,067
You don't wanna know.

800
01:20:27,227 --> 01:20:30,867
It's fine if you don't
wanna tell me.

801
01:20:32,547 --> 01:20:35,307
No... That's not it.

802
01:20:36,347 --> 01:20:38,827
It's just that remembering...

803
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:39,907
Forget it.

804
01:20:41,467 --> 01:20:43,307
It doesn't matter.

805
01:21:26,667 --> 01:21:28,187
What was that?

806
01:21:46,187 --> 01:21:48,667
- It's Youssef.
- No way!

807
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:51,467
- We gotta help him.
- Are you crazy?

808
01:21:51,507 --> 01:21:52,507
He's gonna kill us!

809
01:21:52,907 --> 01:21:55,147
He helped me first, I owe him.

810
01:21:55,387 --> 01:21:57,547
Youssef! Youssef!

811
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:10,827
- What are you doing here?
- And you?

812
01:22:10,867 --> 01:22:12,963
I don't know whether to kick
your ass or to thank you.

813
01:22:12,987 --> 01:22:15,227
Because of you the police
caught Moha

814
01:22:15,267 --> 01:22:16,547
and discovered the flat!

815
01:22:16,587 --> 01:22:18,707
And what the fuck is
he doing here?

816
01:22:19,307 --> 01:22:22,747
- You can trust him.
- Look at us!

817
01:22:22,987 --> 01:22:24,443
We had to leave with just
the clothes on our backs.

818
01:22:24,467 --> 01:22:27,627
It's almost better this way...
we're leaving right away.

819
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:29,267
And you should do the same.

820
01:22:29,307 --> 01:22:32,067
If they catch you they'll
kick you out of the country.

821
01:22:32,107 --> 01:22:33,787
I'm fine here.

822
01:22:35,587 --> 01:22:37,947
And how are you gonna do it?

823
01:22:46,147 --> 01:22:48,027
You see that?
It goes to France,

824
01:22:48,067 --> 01:22:50,547
but we gotta hurry, it's about
to leave.

825
01:22:51,227 --> 01:22:53,227
Hey, stop!
The guards!

826
01:23:00,107 --> 01:23:01,547
Come on guys, please!

827
01:23:01,587 --> 01:23:03,907
I just need your help to
get him on there.

828
01:23:04,507 --> 01:23:06,587
Then you can leave if you want.

829
01:23:08,507 --> 01:23:09,987
Please.

830
01:23:13,347 --> 01:23:14,987
Here, take him.

831
01:23:15,707 --> 01:23:17,707
Go, go, it's leaving!

832
01:23:30,067 --> 01:23:31,467
Let's go! Let's go!

833
01:23:31,907 --> 01:23:33,547
Rafa!

834
01:23:35,867 --> 01:23:37,667
Now hand over my brother!

835
01:23:38,547 --> 01:23:40,387
Come on, get in!
Come with me!

836
01:23:40,427 --> 01:23:42,867
He's got his life here,
you don't fit in it!

837
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:45,587
What are you doing?

838
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:48,707
Hey... Ibrahim!

839
01:24:00,187 --> 01:24:01,667
Are you stupid?

840
01:24:01,947 --> 01:24:03,587
Why didn't you go?

841
01:24:21,187 --> 01:24:23,307
- Does it sting?
- A bit.

842
01:24:23,587 --> 01:24:25,587
That's because it's healing.
