1
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,108
This is the universe.

2
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,231
Big, isn't it?

3
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,403
Thousands of suns, millions of stars,...

4
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:48,157
...separated by immense distances
and by thin floating clouds of gas.

5
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,623
The starlight makes the gas transparent.

6
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:57,583
Where there are no stars
it appears as dark, obscuring clouds...

7
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,550
...like that great black cone over there.

8
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,010
Hello,...

9
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,135
...there's a nova.

10
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,262
A whole solar system exploded.

11
00:03:09,897 --> 00:03:13,729
Someone must've been messing about
with the uranium atom.

12
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,311
No, it's not our solar system,
I'm glad to say.

13
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:28,789
Ah, those are called
a globular cluster of stars.

14
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,333
Rather fine.

15
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,170
Down here in the right-hand corner,...

16
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,885
...see that little chap
rather like a boy scout's badge?

17
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:47,225
It's a mass of gas expanding
at thousands of cubic miles a minute.

18
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,607
Ah, here we are,
we're getting nearer home.

19
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,731
The moon, our moon,...

20
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,858
...in the first quarter,...

21
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,448
...and here's the Earth, our Earth,...

22
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,737
...moving around in its place,...

23
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:11,323
...part of the pattern, part of the universe.

24
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,286
Reassuring, isn't it?

25
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,130
It's night over Europe.

26
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,716
The night of the 2nd May, 1945.

27
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,135
That point of fire is a burning city.

28
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:28,970
It had a thousand-bomber raid
an hour ago.

29
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,522
And here, rolling in over the Atlantic,...

30
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,861
...is a real English fog.

31
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,404
I hope all our aircraft got home safely.

32
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:51,202
Even the big ships sound frightened.

33
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,286
Listen to all the noises in the air.

34
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,918
"This was their finest hour."

35
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,419
Listen...

36
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,171
Listen...

37
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,133
"Request your position."

38
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,134
"Come in, Lancaster.
Come in, Lancaster."

39
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:13,395
"Position nil. Repeat, nil.
Age 27. Very important."

40
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:17,982
"Education violently interrupted.
Religion - Church of England."

41
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:22,107
"Politics - Conservative by nature,
Labour by experience."

42
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,859
- "What's your name?"
- I cannot read you.

43
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,568
Cannot read you.

44
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,785
Request your position.
Can you see our signals?

45
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:35,583
"Give me my scallop-shell of quiet,
My staff of faith to walk upon,...

46
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,542
...My scrip of joy, immortal diet,
My bottle of salvation,...

47
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,919
...My gown of glory, hope's true gage,
And thus I'll take my pilgrimage."

48
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,044
"Sir Walter Raleigh wrote that."

49
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,259
"I'd rather have written that
than flown through Hitler's legs."

50
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,807
I cannot understand you.

51
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:58,314
Hello, Lancaster. We are sending signals.
Can you see our signals?

52
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,477
Come in, Lancaster. Come in, Lancaster.

53
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:40,642
But at my back I always hear
Time's wingèd chariot hurrying near.

54
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,559
And yonder all before us lie
Deserts of vast eternity.

55
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,732
Andy Marvell. What a marvel!
What's your name?

56
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:51,199
Are you receiving me?
Repeat, are you receiving me?

57
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,162
Request your position.
Come in, Lancaster.

58
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:58,120
I can't give you my position.
Instruments gone, crew gone.

59
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,457
Except Bob, my sparks. He's dead.

60
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:04,086
The rest bailed out on my orders.
Time 03.35. Get that?

61
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,793
Crew bailed out 03.35

62
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,712
"Station - Warrenden.
Bomber Group - A, G."

63
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,427
Station - Warrenden.
Bomber Group - A, Apple, G, George.

64
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,680
They'll be sorry about Bob.
We liked him.

65
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:19,436
Hello, G, George. Hello, G, George.
Are you all right?

66
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,434
Are you going to try to land?
Do you want a fix?

67
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,695
Name's not G, George, it's P, Peter.
Peter D Carter. D's for David.

68
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:31,150
Squadron Leader Peter Carter.
Can't land - undercarriage is gone.

69
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,407
I'm bailing out, I'm bailing out.

70
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,786
- "Take a telegram."
- Received your message.

71
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,750
- We can hear you.
- "Telegram to my mother."

72
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,576
"Mrs Michael Carter,
88 Hampstead Lane, London Northwest."

73
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,706
88 Hampstead Lane, London.

74
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,542
Tell her that I love her.

75
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:53,054
You'll have to write this, but I want her
to know I love her very much.

76
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,886
I've never shown it to her, not really,...

77
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,053
...but I've loved her always
right up to the end.

78
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,852
"Give my love to my two sisters, too.
Don't forget them."

79
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,355
Received your message.
We can hear you.

80
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,567
Are you wounded? Repeat, are you
wounded? Are you bailing out?

81
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,656
- What's your name?
- June.

82
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:18,530
Yes, I'm bailing out, but there's a catch.
I've got no parachute.

83
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:22,164
H-Hello? Hello, Peter, do not understand.

84
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,209
Hello? Hello, Peter, can you hear me?

85
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,672
"Hello, June, don't be afraid.
It's quite simple."

86
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,422
We've had it and I'd rather jump than fry.

87
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:36,551
After the first thousand feet
I shan't know anything, anyway.

88
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,304
"I say, I hope I haven't frightened you."

89
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,058
- No, I'm not frightened.
- "Good girl!"

90
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,772
Your sparks, you said he was dead.
Hasn't he got a chute?

91
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,855
Cut to ribbons. Cannon shell.
Are you pretty?

92
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,565
Not bad.

93
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,271
- "Can you hear me well?"
- Yes.

94
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,786
You've got guts. I've known dozens
of girls, been in love with some.

95
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,745
But an American girl I've never seen
and never shall see...

96
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,283
...will hear my last words.

97
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,962
"Rather sweet."

98
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,124
June, if you're around
when they pick me up,...

99
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,918
...turn your head away.

100
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:16,001
But perhaps we can do something, Peter.
Let me report it.

101
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,971
"No, no-one can help. Only you.
Let me do this in my own way."

102
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,268
"I want to be alone with you.
Where were you born?"

103
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,223
- Boston.
- "Mass?"

104
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,305
Yes.

105
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:30,652
History was made there. Are you in love
with anybody? No, don't answer.

106
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,937
I could love a man like you, Peter.

107
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,773
I love you, June, you're life.
Do you live on the station?

108
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,409
No, in a big house five miles from here.
Lee Wood House.

109
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,495
- "Old house?"
- Yes, very old.

110
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,538
I'll come and see you as a ghost!
You're not frightened of ghosts?

111
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,461
I'm not frightened.

112
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,708
- "What time will you be home?"
- I'm on duty till 6.

113
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,625
I have breakfast in the mess,
then I have to cycle half an hour.

114
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,754
I often go along the sands.

115
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,881
This is such nonsense!

116
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,136
It's the best sense I ever heard.
I was lucky to get you.

117
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,721
Can't be helped about the parachute.
I'll have wings soon.

118
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,521
Hope they haven't gone modern.
I'd hate to have a prop instead!

119
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,606
- "What's the next world like?"
- Oh, Peter!

120
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,692
"I think it starts
where this one leaves off."

121
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:20,822
Or where it could if we listened
to Plato, Aristotle and Jesus.

122
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:25,781
With all our earthly problems solved
but with greater ones worth solving.

123
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:29,250
I'm signing off now, June.
Goodbye. Goodbye, June.

124
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,952
Hello, G for George. Hello, G, George!

125
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,082
Hello, G, George!

126
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,755
Hel...

127
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,258
So long, Bob, I'll see you in a minute.

128
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,138
You know what we wear by now -
prop or wings.

129
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,585
A prop... or wings.

130
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,881
Prop...

131
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,803
...or wings.

132
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,508
Prop...

133
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,633
...or wings.

134
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,176
A prop... or wings.

135
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,434
Prop... or wings.

136
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,902
Prop...

137
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,820
...or wings.

138
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,176
Vrrrrrrm!

139
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,886
- Aghh!
- Oh, bad luck, old boy.

140
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,233
Name and rank.

141
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:52,117
Come on, fellas,
break it up, spread out.

142
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,956
Room with bath.

143
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,788
- Do you have USO shows here?
- No, we don't.

144
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,538
OK, we'll stay.
Officers' quarters, of course.

145
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:05,668
- We're all the same here, Captain.
- Excuse me,... brother.

146
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,928
Take over.

147
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:19,606
- I wish I could make a phone call.
- From here that'd be long distance.

148
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,727
Flying Officer Trubshaw.

149
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,859
You can't wait here. You must be
mistaken about your captain.

150
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,284
- If anyone's mistaken, it's not me.
- Mistakes don't happen here.

151
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,496
- This is the Aircrew Section?
- You should know.

152
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,244
Peter couldn't have got away with it.

153
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,124
Besides, you checked his invoice for me.

154
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,793
Yes, it was against the regulations.

155
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:48,172
Regulations are made to be broken.
He was due half an hour after me.

156
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,926
This is his section. He hasn't reported.

157
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,844
He's either AWOL
or there's been a mistake.

158
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,143
There hasn't been a mistake here
for 1,000 years.

159
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,763
Oh? So there have been mistakes?

160
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,604
The girl here before me
was here 640 years.

161
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,313
Holy smoke!

162
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:08,941
If the records don't balance,
alarm bells ring in the Records Office.

163
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,483
I bet they do. Proper flap, eh?

164
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,994
Yes.

165
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,588
That's only the living records.

166
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,710
Everyone on Earth has a file.

167
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:32,759
Russian, Chinese, black or white,
Republican or Democrat.

168
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,517
Holy smoke! If anyone had said clerks
worked up here just like on Earth...

169
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,101
Everyone here can start how they like.

170
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,399
Heaven, isn't it?

171
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,113
You see?

172
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,198
There are millions of people on Earth
who'd think it heaven to be a clerk.

173
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,321
And don't say "Holy smoke".

174
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:00,074
- Why not?
- There's no smoke without fire...

175
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,661
...and we don't call smoke... holy.

176
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,794
Thanks for the gen,... Section Officer.

177
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,547
Boy, oh, boy, home was nothin' like this!

178
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,217
Mine was.

179
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,392
Sign here.

180
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:27,024
All right, I don't want to start
those bells ringing!

181
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,418
I wonder where I report.

182
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,443
Oh, I always hoped there would be dogs.

183
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,850
Good morning.

184
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,562
Morning.

185
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,688
Where do I go from here?

186
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,779
- Huh?!
- I'm new, I only just arrived.

187
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,243
- Where do I report?
- You mean the aerodrome?

188
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,364
Aerodrome?

189
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,881
Where am I? This place, what's it called?

190
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,001
- The Burrows.
- Where?

191
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,128
- Lee Wood.
- Lee Wood?

192
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,469
- Yeah.
- Do you know Lee Wood House?

193
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:27,263
That's it - where the smoke is,
behind those trees.

194
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:31,343
- Is that the quickest way?
- There's a track. See that bike?

195
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,272
- Who is it?
- Dunno. One of the Yank girls.

196
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,399
They live up at the house.

197
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,868
Here, Jock!

198
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,919
Hi!

199
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,178
Hello.

200
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,718
Hello yourself. What's wrong?

201
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,149
You're June.

202
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,534
You're Peter!

203
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,615
How did you get here?

204
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:35,829
I'm glad you're safe.
What did you do? What happened?

205
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,085
- I just don't know.
- Are you hurt?

206
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,958
My head feels a bit queer.

207
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,550
There's a little cut in your hair.
It's nothing much.

208
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,589
Oh, Peter, it was a cruel joke.

209
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,716
If it was, it was on me.

210
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:52,721
I've been crying
ever since we said goodbye.

211
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:56,305
- Don't cry, darling.
- Oh, Peter, darling.

212
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:11,447
91,716 invoiced.

213
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,534
91,715 checked in.

214
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,788
- Conductor 71.
- It could've 'appened to anybody.

215
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,499
How did it happen?

216
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:24,047
Everything was calculated
but for the accursed fog!

217
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:27,593
The pilot jumped,
he got lost in the fog, I missed him.

218
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,265
Flying Officer Trubshaw.

219
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,769
You've been waiting all day for your pilot.

220
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:44,520
Yes, ma'am. Over the Channel,
there was a ruddy peasouper!

221
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:45,687
Ah-ha!

222
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,863
Oh, excuse the language, ma'am.

223
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:51,824
It was so thick, you could've stepped
out of the kite and walked on it!

224
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,955
- Sacré brouillard!
- And he, the skipper,...

225
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:58,167
...ordered everybody
to bail out over the coast.

226
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,461
He knew his brolly... chute...
had been written off.

227
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,629
It was hit as he was bandaging me.

228
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:05,751
But he didn't tell the others.

229
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,506
I only knew because I'd bought it by then.

230
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:11,129
I mean, I was... dead.

231
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,973
I understand.

232
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,094
I knew he'd be clocking in here.

233
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:20,440
I thought I'd stooge around and
wait for him. Er, this young lady...

234
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,559
...is not to blame at all.

235
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:26,896
- I'm sorry if I broke the rules.
- Thank you.

236
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,535
19 hours and 50 minutes have elapsed.

237
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:35,493
Don't you know that any slip
must be reported immediately?

238
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,458
- I lost my head.
- Not long in the service.

239
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,538
I joined in the so-called
Second Germinal...

240
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:44,921
...of the so-called
glorious French Revolution.

241
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,042
I see. Natural death.

242
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,253
I lost my head.

243
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,508
The case is not so simple.

244
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,434
- Non?
- No.

245
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,553
He's fallen in love.

246
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,147
Ahhhh!

247
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:01,471
Oh.

248
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,684
- It complicates things.
- True.

249
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:06,190
- You must do your best.
- Oui, madame.

250
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,776
- Proceed to Earth immediately.
- Oui.

251
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,860
You'll explain your grave error to Carter...

252
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:14,780
- ...and ask him to follow you.
- Oui, madame.

253
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:15,944
Wait!

254
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,165
Your captain is not
an unreasonable man, I hope.

255
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:23,040
The skipper? Oh, no, ma'am...
unless he's had a few!

256
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,459
Er... pardon? 'Ad a few?

257
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,460
- Beers.
- Oh, la bière!

258
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:31,629
Scotch being hard to come by, you know.

259
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,720
- Naturellement!
- By the way,...

260
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,924
...would you give Peter a message for me?

261
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,601
Avec plaisir.

262
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,720
Just say, "What ho".

263
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:41,017
Bon.

264
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:59,538
One is starved for Technicolor up there.

265
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,291
What a night for love!

266
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,867
Drink, darling?

267
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:45,723
Mon ami.

268
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,894
Evening.

269
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:55,692
I think I keep this for a little.

270
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,065
And how are you, my friend?

271
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,193
Never been better.

272
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:02,735
- June, wake...
- She cannot wake.

273
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:06,537
We are talking in space, not in time.

274
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,118
- Are you cracked?
- Look at your watch.

275
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:16,301
It has not moved since you said
so charmingly "Drink, darling?"

276
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,420
Nor will it move,...

277
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,805
...nor will anything move...

278
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:24,969
...until we have finished our little talk.

279
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:27,095
It is only a trick.

280
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,850
Who are you?

281
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:33,019
We should've met yesterday
at 04.10, mon cher.

282
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,562
Unfortunately I missed you.

283
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:38,152
You couldn't have because I wasn't here.

284
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:41,651
I bring you a message from Mr Trubshaw.

285
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,080
Bob?

286
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:47,697
- Bob's dead.
- Oh, yes, he's dead.

287
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,619
He says... "What ho!"

288
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:54,087
That sounds like Trubshaw.
But he is dead, isn't he?

289
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:57,382
- En effet. But how? Why?
- Cannon shell.

290
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,633
And what should happen to a man...

291
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:03,463
...who jumps from his aircraft
without his parachute?

292
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,177
How do you know?

293
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,979
But it is I who am telling you, my friend.

294
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:09,682
It is I!

295
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,807
Your time was up,...

296
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:16,021
...but I missed you because of your
ridiculous English climate.

297
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:17,731
I am French.

298
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:21,987
- But what do you want now?
- You, my friend.

299
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:24,111
- What for?
- To conduct you.

300
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:26,617
- Where to?
- To the training centre.

301
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:29,369
- Training for what?
- For another world.

302
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,204
You don't mean...?

303
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:38,751
But, my dear friend,
that is just what I do mean.

304
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:41,720
Oh, this is absolutely fantastic!

305
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:44,337
June!

306
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:45,636
June!

307
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,517
All right, and what if I refuse to go?

308
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:54,898
But you cannot refuse. Your time was up.

309
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:58,858
Now, by mistake,
you overstayed by about,...

310
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:01,195
...speaking in time, of course,...

311
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:02,901
...20 hours.

312
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:07,826
The advantage was exclusively yours.
You lost nothing, you only gained.

313
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,747
What about her?

314
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,962
Exquise.

315
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,044
You will see her again
when her time comes.

316
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:27,387
She will live to be... ninety-seven.
I looked her up in the files.

317
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:31,135
- I'm in love with her.
- But, my friend, what is love?

318
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,263
The feeling of the moment,...

319
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:35,604
...but I represent eternity.

320
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,940
The law of this world and the other.

321
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,358
- Good, but what is law?
- Law is law.

322
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:42,777
- Law is based on reason.
- That is so.

323
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:46,406
Now, yesterday I wasn't in love.
Today I am.

324
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:49,371
But what is love?
How many people are in love?

325
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,869
Soldiers, airmen, how many sailors?

326
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,166
Do they protest when their time is up?
No, they don't.

327
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:57,999
- They have no right, but I have.
- Why?

328
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:01,215
Look, I've fallen in love
because of your mistake.

329
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:04,545
I'm in a different position
from what I was in last night.

330
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,672
I expected to die, I was ready to die.

331
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:09,297
It wasn't my fault I didn't, it was yours!

332
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:12,007
- What government do you represent?
- None!

333
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:13,888
What laws govern the place?

334
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:16,595
I cannot express any political views.

335
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:19,271
A respectable place
must have law of appeal.

336
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:22,273
- Be reasonable! Appeal to whom?
- You find out.

337
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:26,153
- It has never been done!
- Is that any reason why it can't be done?

338
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:29,285
You are determined
to get me into... the salad.

339
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:31,535
What about the salad you got me into?

340
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:35,282
Now, look here, you don't want me
to use force, do you?

341
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:37,411
Oh, well, you can always try.

342
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:41,296
- I think I leave you for a little.
- That's the form.

343
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:45,089
- I shall report for instructions.
- Now you're talking!

344
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:48,256
And... do not fall any deeper in love now.

345
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:50,382
You have been warned.

346
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,509
She is...

347
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:54,221
...charming.

348
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,809
You know, I think you're not a bad chap.

349
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,808
Do you play chess?

350
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,318
Yes.

351
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:03,022
So do I.

352
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:05,147
We could play every day.

353
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,358
Some other time.

354
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,820
Next time, perhaps?

355
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,532
Au revoir, mon ami.

356
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:23,623
No, thank you, darling.

357
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:26,083
"No, thank you" what?

358
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:29,676
You just asked me to have a drink.

359
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,888
Did I?

360
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,558
Yes, I remember I did.

361
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:48,360
- What's the matter with me?
- What is it? Is it your head again?

362
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,282
Might be, yes.

363
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:54,198
An odd thing happened
while you were asleep.

364
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,204
I haven't been asleep.

365
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:59,002
Didn't you hear us talking?

366
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:00,585
No.

367
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,704
Who was there to talk to?

368
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:06,290
- They sent somebody.
- They? Who are they?

369
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:09,670
I don't know.

370
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:14,549
June, do I look cracked?

371
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:18,183
Not to me, darling. Are you?

372
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:21,601
There was a ten-tenths' fog last night.

373
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,687
- That's right, isn't it?
- You know there was.

374
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:28,484
- I did bail out without a parachute.
- That's your story.

375
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,651
- So how can I be alive?
- I give up.

376
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:35,449
- I don't know and I don't care.
- My parachute was shot up.

377
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,079
When I came to, I had none.
Anyway, why wasn't I drowned?

378
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,830
No need to prove to me
you ought to be dead.

379
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,452
I ought to be according to this character.

380
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:48,172
This conductor they sent after me
said he missed me in the fog.

381
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:51,136
Bad luck for them, good luck for me.

382
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:54,429
I said I'd appeal.
He's gone to get instructions.

383
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:56,550
It's not my fault I'm not dead!

384
00:32:56,684 --> 00:33:00,100
It's not my fault I found you
and fell in love with you.

385
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,433
Maybe he wasn't here at all!

386
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,560
Hey, you, Frenchman!

387
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:08,687
Where are you?!

388
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:13,277
- What is it?
- Ohh, I've got an awful headache.

389
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:24,788
June?

390
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:26,960
June, you're there, aren't you?

391
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,925
Yes, Peter, of course I'm here.

392
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:34,171
I... thought I'd lost you.

393
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:43,388
Dr Reeves's residence.

394
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,515
Oh, good morning, Miss June.

395
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:49,944
Yes, isn't it? The doctor's up in his thing -
his camera obscura.

396
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:54,448
He's got his new lens from the shop
today. It makes a lovely picture.

397
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:57,909
He's taken the big white garden table
to project on.

398
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:01,987
He'll be glad you're coming over.
He's showing it to the dogs.

399
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:04,331
Ah, nice day.

400
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:08,041
Hmm, Mrs Bedwell's ducks out too early.

401
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:11,043
She'll lose all the eggs if she's not careful.

402
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:15,387
Ahh, the start of the cycling season.
There's a hefty young girl.

403
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:19,178
Time Mrs Tucker went to get our rations.
There she is.

404
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:23,437
Ooh, the Vicar and his sister -
not coming here, I hope. No. Good.

405
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:27,395
Quite a queue at the butcher's.
Must have some offal.

406
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:33,065
Wonderful how the kids love playing
in the splash. The same in my day.

407
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:35,404
That tree ought to come down.

408
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:42,494
Old Mary looking quite skittish.

409
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:45,245
Sally Allgood getting herself dated up.

410
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,784
Ah, here's June, here she comes.

411
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:50,919
She walks in beauty like the night.

412
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,632
Only she's cycling and the sun is out.
Nice girl.

413
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:59,012
Worth a hatful of ambassadors
in Lee Wood, anyway.

414
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,933
Come on up!

415
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:22,239
Hello, Doc.

416
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:24,863
Hello, June. Come in, shut the door.

417
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:31,663
Surveying your kingdom?

418
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:34,419
A village doctor has to know everything.

419
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,382
You'd be surprised how many diagnoses
I've formed up here.

420
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:41,051
I love looking at the village from here.

421
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:43,175
Looks so different.

422
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:47,556
That's because you see it all clearly
and at once, as in a poet's eye.

423
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:49,147
I want to talk to you.

424
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:51,765
So you said, but it's none of my business.

425
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:54,273
Dr McEwen says it's right up your street.

426
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:58,104
This is my street, a village street.
I'm a village doctor.

427
00:35:58,241 --> 00:36:00,233
Only because you like living here.

428
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:04,235
McEwen says what you don't know
about neurology would fill a peanut.

429
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:05,747
I'm a good guesser.

430
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:08,364
Your guesses are in famous magazines...

431
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:11,419
...like that "Brain" I've seen in your library.

432
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:14,084
- Dr McEwen says...
- I know what he says.

433
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:17,169
- I had a talk with him on the phone.
- Oh, did you?

434
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:19,294
After I'd talked to you.

435
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:23,806
This is the RAF's business.
Carter should rejoin his station today.

436
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:26,768
- I know.
- What's it got to do with you?

437
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,887
Oh, I'm just interested.

438
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:30,397
Oh, I see.

439
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:32,812
Strictly speaking, he's a RAF case.

440
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:35,943
He's not a case, he's a person,
a very fine person.

441
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,814
I want you to see him, Frank.

442
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:41,612
I don't want just anyone mauling him
and asking him questions.

443
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:44,281
I want you. I'm sure the RAF would say...

444
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:47,662
I know what they'd say.
I spoke to his CO this morning.

445
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,830
- Oh, Frank!
- And to his Group MO.

446
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:52,581
- Fortunately, he's heard of me.
- Frank!

447
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:56,045
If you'd done that earlier,
I'd have told you earlier.

448
00:36:56,174 --> 00:37:00,468
You can't kidnap RAF officers
just cos you like the shape of their nose!

449
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:03,845
Not his nose, his voice.
I fell for that before I saw him.

450
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:06,381
He believes he jumped
with no parachute?

451
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:08,510
- Yes.
- He has hallucinations?

452
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:10,933
During these bouts, does he go pale?

453
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:14,018
- Yes, yes, he did.
- He has headaches... here?

454
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,190
I think so. You'd better ask him.

455
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:19,071
- But he definitely sees things?
- And hears.

456
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:22,281
All right. Did you tell him
he was talking rubbish?

457
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:23,784
- No.
- Quite right.

458
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,317
He's not. He's talking very logically.

459
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:28,447
Then he can't be in love. Bye.

460
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,703
- Frank...
- Yes?

461
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:34,828
He has a very cute nose, too!

462
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:37,335
- I'll be over about teatime.
- Right.

463
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,063
It's Dr Reeves. Let's go!

464
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:34,645
Yippeeeee!

465
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:49,239
- That's not how to spell Shakespeare.
- Who are you, his agent?

466
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:52,283
You spotted snakes
with double tongue,

467
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:54,787
Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;

468
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:59,087
Newts and blind-worms... er...

469
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:01,253
Do no wrong.

470
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:04,668
...do no wrong,
Come not near our fairy queen.

471
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:07,887
You can never bring in a wall.
What say you, Bottom?

472
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:10,137
- Some guy or other...
- No, no, no!

473
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:13,849
My dear Private Logan,
Bottom's not a gangster. Watch!

474
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:16,185
Some man or other must present wall:

475
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:20,644
and let him have some plaster or some
loam or some rough-cast about him...

476
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:22,396
...to signify wall;...

477
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:24,735
...and let him hold his fingers thus...

478
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:28,648
...and through that cranny
shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.

479
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:31,192
- Try that, my boy.
- Can I do the business?

480
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:33,452
- It's as well, yes.
- Oh, brother!

481
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:36,416
Some man or other must present wall:

482
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:41,335
and let him have some plaster or some
loam or some rough-cast about him...

483
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:43,172
...to signify wall.

484
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:06,734
Check.

485
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:13,954
Peter?

486
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,658
Check.

487
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:23,167
Oh, dear, I didn't see that one coming.

488
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:28,340
- Good afternoon.
- Hello, Frank.

489
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:30,676
Squadron Leader Carter - Dr Reeves.

490
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:34,055
- Do I get some tea?
- It's ordered. Ginger cookies.

491
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:36,556
- Good. Who's winning?
- June's good.

492
00:40:36,686 --> 00:40:39,224
But he's winning. Sit down, everybody.

493
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,978
Thank you.

494
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:55,320
- I've told Peter.
- What?

495
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:57,993
Who you are, what you are,
all about you.

496
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:01,078
- Tall order.
- And I've told you all about him.

497
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,666
- Has she read your poems?
- What poems?

498
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:06,122
Didn't you know? This is Peter Carter.

499
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:09,128
- I didn't know.
- We hadn't got around to that.

500
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,297
I haven't got much modern stuff,
but you're there.

501
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,301
- Good.
- I like your viewpoint, your English.

502
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:18,054
- I hope we shall have some talks.
- So do I.

503
00:41:18,186 --> 00:41:20,095
Let's get down to this thing.

504
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:23,645
You've never had any visions
or hallucinations before?

505
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:25,767
- Never.
- What were you before?

506
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:27,894
I did European History at Oxford.

507
00:41:28,029 --> 00:41:30,983
- Both parents alive?
- My mother.

508
00:41:31,115 --> 00:41:33,357
- Brothers, sisters?
- Two sisters.

509
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:36,114
What was the cause
of your father's death?

510
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:37,823
Same as mine.

511
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:39,747
- Brain?
- No, war.

512
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:41,499
- When?
- 1917.

513
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:44,247
- You're... er... 29?
- 27.

514
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:46,170
- Called up?
- Volunteered.

515
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:48,788
- Trained in Canada. Ops in '41.
- Bomber?

516
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:51,546
Coastals, then instructor,
back to bombers.

517
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:53,836
- Must've done a good many ops?
- 67.

518
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:57,138
They let you go back
with your experience and seniority?

519
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:59,473
- New job. Master bomber.
- Tricky?

520
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:02,010
- Somebody's got to do it.
- Hmm.

521
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:07,147
Now... about these headaches.

522
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:09,483
- When did they start?
- Headaches?

523
00:42:09,612 --> 00:42:14,404
I know you get them and you've told
nobody about them, especially your MO.

524
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:18,116
- What else do you know?
- I know about your eyes.

525
00:42:18,246 --> 00:42:20,867
- You know a good deal.
- Like to know more.

526
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,619
All right.

527
00:42:26,045 --> 00:42:28,832
Now, these headaches,
when did they start?

528
00:42:28,965 --> 00:42:30,542
- Six months ago.
- Bad?

529
00:42:30,675 --> 00:42:32,169
- Not at first.
- Where?

530
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:35,219
- Here.
- Frontal and temporal.

531
00:42:35,346 --> 00:42:38,431
Did you ever have
a rather nasty bang on the head?

532
00:42:38,558 --> 00:42:40,550
- I don't think so.
- Sure?

533
00:42:40,685 --> 00:42:42,843
The usual one - dropped as a baby.

534
00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:45,268
Has that spoilt everything for you?

535
00:42:45,398 --> 00:42:49,063
- Yes, I'm afraid it does.
- I'll see what I can cook up.

536
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:52,230
- Do you mind if I try something?
- No, go ahead.

537
00:42:52,363 --> 00:42:55,815
Now... er... just face this way. Don't move.

538
00:42:57,577 --> 00:43:00,661
Now, don't move your eyes,
look straight ahead.

539
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:02,911
- Check.
- What are you looking at?

540
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:06,244
- The girl with red hair and legs!
- Right, I've got her.

541
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:08,749
- Don't take your eyes off her.
- Easy!

542
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,008
Without moving your eyes,
what can you see on the extreme right?

543
00:43:13,134 --> 00:43:15,127
- Fireplace.
- In the centre?

544
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:17,254
- Girl.
- Extreme left?

545
00:43:18,598 --> 00:43:20,175
Windows?

546
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:22,099
- Curtains?
- Yes.

547
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:23,804
- Colour?
- Red.

548
00:43:24,812 --> 00:43:26,604
Right, that'll do.

549
00:43:26,731 --> 00:43:29,518
If you've quite done staring
at that girl's legs...

550
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:31,643
You've got to do as the doctor says.

551
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:34,862
Confidentially,
they're rather knock-kneed.

552
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,113
Hmm.

553
00:43:39,243 --> 00:43:41,236
- Any loss of appetite?
- No.

554
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:43,363
- Nor of thirst?
- No fear.

555
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:46,617
You've been eating and drinking
more than usual.

556
00:43:46,751 --> 00:43:51,579
- You've just seen my mess bills!
- And you've... seen something.

557
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:53,873
- Someone.
- Clearly?

558
00:43:54,008 --> 00:43:55,586
As clear as I see you.

559
00:43:55,718 --> 00:43:58,838
- Had such an hallucination before?
- No, thanks.

560
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:03,883
Do you believe in the survival of
human personality after death?

561
00:44:04,018 --> 00:44:06,390
I thought you said you read my verses.

562
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:08,348
Do you?

563
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:12,479
I don't know, I've never thought about it.
Do you?

564
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:15,481
I don't know.
I've thought about it too much.

565
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:24,328
- I thought I was asked to tea.
- It isn't time yet.

566
00:44:24,455 --> 00:44:26,662
Past my time. One last question.

567
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:31,500
It may sound silly,
but have you imagined recently...

568
00:44:31,629 --> 00:44:35,212
...that you've smelt something
that couldn't be there?

569
00:44:35,341 --> 00:44:37,417
What an extraordinary thing!

570
00:44:37,552 --> 00:44:39,343
- What is?
- How did you know?

571
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,048
A long shot. You have?

572
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,932
Yes. It was so silly,
I'd never have told you.

573
00:44:44,058 --> 00:44:47,593
It might explain everything abnormal
you've seen and heard.

574
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:51,596
But it still can't explain how I can jump
without a parachute and be alive.

575
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:55,565
No, but there might be a possible
explanation even of that.

576
00:44:55,695 --> 00:44:59,562
Now, this heavenly messenger,
you saw him quite clearly?

577
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:01,692
I told you, as clear as I see you.

578
00:45:01,826 --> 00:45:04,447
This smell you imagined
was at the same time?

579
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:06,571
Yes, it was particularly strong.

580
00:45:06,706 --> 00:45:08,449
- A pleasant smell?
- Yes.

581
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:11,074
- Could you place it?
- Fried onions.

582
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:14,793
And this messenger,
he hasn't turned up again?

583
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:16,500
- No, but he will.
- When?

584
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:21,793
- He picks his own time and stops it.
- Peter's appealed against his call-up.

585
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:25,797
- That's the spirit. Don't give in.
- I won't.

586
00:45:25,933 --> 00:45:28,721
I'm lucky June knew you.
Thank you for coming.

587
00:45:28,853 --> 00:45:31,344
June has lucky friends. I've got bad news.

588
00:45:31,481 --> 00:45:33,806
- Why the grin?
- You're going with me.

589
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:36,018
- Where?
- My house. For two reasons.

590
00:45:36,152 --> 00:45:38,358
I want to meet this chap next time...

591
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:40,646
...and I like a nice girl in the house.

592
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:44,032
She only comes to borrow a book
and she's a slow reader!

593
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,865
- What about my CO?
- I've fixed it with him.

594
00:45:46,996 --> 00:45:50,081
Besides, until we get this settled,
I'm your CO.

595
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:52,496
At my house, you get your tea at 4.30.

596
00:45:52,627 --> 00:45:55,296
Tea break!

597
00:45:55,421 --> 00:45:57,414
Here you get it at five.

598
00:45:58,633 --> 00:46:00,210
Sinkers, Doc?

599
00:46:00,343 --> 00:46:01,921
Thank you.

600
00:46:02,053 --> 00:46:04,544
We're shaping, Frank, we're shaping!

601
00:46:24,575 --> 00:46:26,568
Ohhh!

602
00:46:31,499 --> 00:46:33,492
Ah-ha! 20-all!

603
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:44,503
21-20. Sorry.

604
00:46:44,637 --> 00:46:47,175
- You're sorry, my foot! Ready?
- Ready.

605
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:53,597
- Nearly.
- Nearly doesn't count. 21-all.

606
00:46:56,357 --> 00:46:58,149
- I'll be...
- Count 10.

607
00:46:58,276 --> 00:47:00,268
I wonder if Peter's a good player.

608
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:03,439
- Ask him when he wakes.
- He's been asleep 2½ hours.

609
00:47:03,573 --> 00:47:05,565
- He'll wake at 11.
- How do you know?

610
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,906
- I gave him a tablet.
- How can you tell?

611
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:10,443
- I know the patient.
- Do you know him?

612
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,572
- I think so.
- Tell me about him!

613
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:15,542
Are we playing table tennis
or are we not?

614
00:47:15,668 --> 00:47:17,708
- All right, your serve.
- Ready?

615
00:47:17,837 --> 00:47:19,830
- Ready.
- Ohh!

616
00:47:19,964 --> 00:47:21,542
Your game.

617
00:47:22,884 --> 00:47:25,173
Now tell me what you think about him.

618
00:47:25,303 --> 00:47:28,090
- I think he's fascinating.
- So do I.

619
00:47:28,222 --> 00:47:30,215
Not biologically. Medically.

620
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,342
- Have a drink?
- Love one.

621
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:43,061
What do the books say, Doc?

622
00:47:44,197 --> 00:47:46,236
I see a dark stranger in his life.

623
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,921
Do you know what's wrong with him?

624
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:06,884
Yes, I think I do.

625
00:48:07,011 --> 00:48:09,004
Is he... going to be all right?

626
00:48:09,138 --> 00:48:11,594
He'll be all right. Here's your drink.

627
00:48:11,724 --> 00:48:14,180
Will he have any more hallucinations?

628
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:16,303
- Yes.
- How do you know?

629
00:48:16,437 --> 00:48:19,474
Because this conductor
promised to come back.

630
00:48:19,607 --> 00:48:22,312
- Will that make him worse?
- Why should it?

631
00:48:22,443 --> 00:48:26,523
I don't know. Seeing things,
arguing about his own life.

632
00:48:26,656 --> 00:48:30,570
- Talking to a non-existent man...
- He does exist for him.

633
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:34,035
He's not going mad?
His brain isn't being affected?

634
00:48:34,163 --> 00:48:36,203
It is, but not in the way you mean.

635
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:39,119
That's why I asked him
about his sense of smell.

636
00:48:39,252 --> 00:48:41,043
I saw it was important.

637
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:44,207
He's having highly organised
hallucinations...

638
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:47,092
...comparable to an experience
of actual life.

639
00:48:47,218 --> 00:48:50,005
A combination of vision,
hearing and idea.

640
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:54,218
To a neurologist, it points directly
to the sense of smell or taste.

641
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:58,218
Once that connection's established,
we know where to look.

642
00:48:58,354 --> 00:49:02,767
I want to find out one thing more
in his history. I'll find it out later.

643
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,276
Now...

644
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:09,316
- I'm not going to tell you any more.
- Thanks.

645
00:49:10,491 --> 00:49:13,611
- But how did he survive the jump?
- I don't know.

646
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:16,995
If we could find out and tell him,
it would save him.

647
00:49:17,123 --> 00:49:20,872
It would help, but the main thing
is for him to win his case.

648
00:49:21,002 --> 00:49:23,837
- Are you serious?
- Perfectly serious.

649
00:49:23,963 --> 00:49:26,170
- We must help him to win it.
- How?

650
00:49:26,299 --> 00:49:29,466
It depends on what message
the conductor brings.

651
00:49:29,594 --> 00:49:32,085
But... suppose he loses his case?

652
00:49:32,221 --> 00:49:33,799
Oh, that's absurd!

653
00:49:33,931 --> 00:49:37,098
If we see he's losing
or we think he's going to lose,...

654
00:49:37,226 --> 00:49:40,595
...we'll find out the reason he survived
or we'll invent one.

655
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:42,723
We'll have a couple of drinks...

656
00:49:42,857 --> 00:49:46,308
...and we'll invent the greatest lie
in medical history.

657
00:49:46,444 --> 00:49:48,900
- Care for another game?
- I don't mind.

658
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:51,236
- Don't worry. See that bell?
- Yes.

659
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:53,821
He'll ring it if he gets another visit.

660
00:49:53,951 --> 00:49:55,944
- Fine.
- Come on, your serve.

661
00:50:04,837 --> 00:50:06,830
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

662
00:50:15,014 --> 00:50:16,592
One-love.

663
00:50:48,047 --> 00:50:50,040
Doc, he's here! June!

664
00:50:56,973 --> 00:50:58,348
Doc?

665
00:51:37,263 --> 00:51:39,588
Eh bien, mon cher, comment ça va?

666
00:51:39,724 --> 00:51:41,302
Not too good.

667
00:51:41,434 --> 00:51:43,427
Not too good. Ah.

668
00:51:44,562 --> 00:51:49,105
I would not bother to ring that bell
if I were you. Nothing will happen.

669
00:51:49,233 --> 00:51:51,606
A little trick of mine. You remember?

670
00:51:51,736 --> 00:51:53,314
After all,...

671
00:51:53,446 --> 00:51:55,439
...what is time?

672
00:52:07,585 --> 00:52:09,578
A mere... tyranny.

673
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:13,375
Let me know if you're
going to do that again.

674
00:52:13,508 --> 00:52:16,129
- Looks good.
- Very good. Know the author?

675
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,752
No, but I often have a game with Philidor.

676
00:52:18,888 --> 00:52:21,759
- Philidor?
- The greatest chess master ever.

677
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:24,845
A Frenchman.
Come along and I'll introduce you.

678
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:26,353
- Good.
- Splendid!

679
00:52:26,479 --> 00:52:29,397
- You've got good news for me.
- How did you guess?

680
00:52:29,524 --> 00:52:32,015
You wouldn't entice me with Philimor...

681
00:52:32,151 --> 00:52:35,401
- Philidor.
- ...if you had the right to conduct me.

682
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:37,107
- True.
- Well?

683
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,276
Speaking officially,
I have good news for you.

684
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,572
Good!

685
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:44,657
- You can appeal to the High Court.
- Splendid!

686
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:49,332
The trial will be très chic. In three days
so you can prepare your case.

687
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,038
Better and better.

688
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:53,792
- Do not be too pleased.
- Is there a catch?

689
00:52:53,923 --> 00:52:55,916
The prosecuting counsel.

690
00:52:56,050 --> 00:53:00,000
I am not permitted to offer advice
or give a personal opinion but...

691
00:53:00,138 --> 00:53:02,344
- Who is this counsel?
- Be prepared.

692
00:53:02,473 --> 00:53:04,051
- For what?
- A shock.

693
00:53:04,183 --> 00:53:07,635
- Tell me the worst. Who is it?
- Abraham Farlan.

694
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:09,763
- Come again?
- Abraham Farlan!

695
00:53:09,897 --> 00:53:11,475
- Never heard of him.
- No?

696
00:53:11,607 --> 00:53:13,434
- Never.
- He lives in Boston.

697
00:53:13,568 --> 00:53:15,857
- I've never been.
- Massachusetts.

698
00:53:15,987 --> 00:53:20,696
- I've never been there!
- Abraham Farlan died in Boston in 1775.

699
00:53:20,825 --> 00:53:23,281
Does that date convey anything to you?

700
00:53:23,411 --> 00:53:25,238
Lexington, Concord.

701
00:53:25,371 --> 00:53:28,989
You are good at history.
The American War of Independence.

702
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:31,877
- Oh, he was killed?
- By a British bullet.

703
00:53:32,003 --> 00:53:34,790
Oh. He might be... prejudiced.

704
00:53:34,922 --> 00:53:37,129
Hmm. He hates your guts.

705
00:53:37,258 --> 00:53:40,425
And he hates the guts
of every Englishman.

706
00:53:40,553 --> 00:53:44,218
And he hates this little affair
with the Boston-born girl.

707
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:46,057
It's not a little affair.

708
00:53:46,184 --> 00:53:49,350
Ohh, a big affair he will hate even more!

709
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:51,685
- I'll appeal against him.
- No good!

710
00:53:51,814 --> 00:53:54,981
We had to choose a good man.
Our honour is at stake.

711
00:53:55,109 --> 00:53:57,731
Non, you must choose
a good man for yourself.

712
00:53:57,862 --> 00:54:00,234
- As defending counsel?
- Precisely.

713
00:54:00,365 --> 00:54:04,197
- Can I choose anybody?
- Anybody who's ever lived on earth.

714
00:54:04,327 --> 00:54:06,319
Everybody is at your disposal.

715
00:54:06,454 --> 00:54:09,490
- You can choose me.
- That would suit your book.

716
00:54:09,624 --> 00:54:13,456
Do not waste time. Abraham Farlan
is piling up his case already.

717
00:54:13,586 --> 00:54:16,373
You can choose Socrates, William Pitt,...

718
00:54:16,506 --> 00:54:18,498
...you can choose Henry VIII.

719
00:54:18,633 --> 00:54:20,625
Oh, Madame Du Barry.

720
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,176
- She knows all about love.
- Rather a one-track mind.

721
00:54:24,305 --> 00:54:26,843
You are a good chess player. Philidor.

722
00:54:26,975 --> 00:54:28,552
I'll think it over.

723
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:30,891
By the way, I'd like to borrow this.

724
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,428
It's not mine, it belongs to the doctor.

725
00:54:33,564 --> 00:54:35,604
- Oh, doctors.
- What about them?

726
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:38,604
They give me a great deal
of trouble in my job.

727
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:49,236
- He was here! He tricked us!
- Yes, he was... here.

728
00:54:51,165 --> 00:54:53,158
And these were on the floor.

729
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:55,285
Peter, sit down.

730
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:01,295
Now...

731
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:03,003
...look up.

732
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:05,508
You've been doing some hard talking.

733
00:55:05,638 --> 00:55:06,801
I have.

734
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:09,138
- You didn't give in to anything?
- No.

735
00:55:09,267 --> 00:55:11,888
- That's the spirit.
- Can I stay overnight?

736
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,890
- Yes, I'll tell Mrs Tucker.
- I don't need much.

737
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:17,015
Now, let's see.

738
00:55:18,693 --> 00:55:21,398
Hmm. I'll tell Mrs Tucker you're staying.

739
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:25,194
Dr Reeves, can I stay in here?
I want to be near these books.

740
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:27,364
Of course. I'll fix up a camp bed.

741
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:30,739
Great news, darling.

742
00:55:30,872 --> 00:55:32,995
- I'm allowed to appeal.
- Really?

743
00:55:33,124 --> 00:55:35,117
June, I don't want to leave you.

744
00:55:35,251 --> 00:55:38,702
Darling, why should you?
Everything will be all right.

745
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:41,874
- If I can get a good counsel.
- Of course you will.

746
00:55:42,008 --> 00:55:44,795
It's very important.
I don't want to lose you.

747
00:55:44,927 --> 00:55:49,008
I don't intend to let you go.
No-one can take you. I won't let them.

748
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:51,975
A judgement against me
would be backed up...

749
00:55:52,101 --> 00:55:55,138
...by all the power of this world
and of the other.

750
00:55:56,481 --> 00:55:58,058
Drink this.

751
00:55:58,191 --> 00:56:01,145
- Peter's got the right to appeal.
- Splendid.

752
00:56:01,277 --> 00:56:02,855
- Smell anything?
- Yes.

753
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:04,565
- Fried onions?
- Yes.

754
00:56:04,697 --> 00:56:06,690
Good. Drink that up.

755
00:56:07,241 --> 00:56:09,234
- Any headache?
- Mm.

756
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:11,361
Tell me tomorrow what he said.

757
00:56:11,496 --> 00:56:13,073
No, he said...

758
00:56:14,165 --> 00:56:15,956
- Good heavens!
- What is it?

759
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:19,334
- He got my Hundred Best Games.
- Alekhese's chess book!

760
00:56:19,462 --> 00:56:22,083
- You sure?
- Certain. He had it in his hand.

761
00:56:22,215 --> 00:56:24,006
- What a nerve!
- A bit cool.

762
00:56:24,133 --> 00:56:27,004
- Now, get to bed.
- I want to talk to you first.

763
00:56:27,136 --> 00:56:31,264
No, have a long sleep.
Tomorrow, you'll feel as fresh as a daisy.

764
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:34,475
- You don't believe a word I say!
- Of course we do!

765
00:56:34,602 --> 00:56:38,434
My dear friend, here on Earth
I am your defending counsel.

766
00:56:38,564 --> 00:56:41,815
As your counsel,
I believe everything you tell me.

767
00:56:50,952 --> 00:56:53,075
- Dr Gaerlter.
- Hello, Dr Reeves.

768
00:56:53,204 --> 00:56:56,240
You make your rounds the hard way.
Give me a coupe!

769
00:56:56,374 --> 00:56:59,161
- Is Dr McEwen free?
- He's going to operate.

770
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:03,374
He hasn't started yet.
I imagine he'll see you in the washroom.

771
00:57:27,196 --> 00:57:30,150
- Hello, Frank, what's new?
- Deterioration.

772
00:57:30,283 --> 00:57:32,275
We ought to operate tonight.

773
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:35,327
Impossible, we're swamped.
Sure of your diagnosis?

774
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:39,666
Certain. He had slight concussion
two years ago - no aftereffects.

775
00:57:39,792 --> 00:57:41,785
The X-ray's inconclusive.

776
00:57:41,919 --> 00:57:46,297
You know about these hallucinations
coupled with a sense of smell.

777
00:57:46,424 --> 00:57:50,469
It points to arachnoid adhesions
involving the olfactory nerve.

778
00:57:50,595 --> 00:57:52,634
A tricky op. I've never seen one.

779
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:55,551
I have - at the Hospital de la Pitié in Paris.

780
00:57:55,683 --> 00:57:58,055
I've made some notes for the surgeon.

781
00:57:58,186 --> 00:58:00,807
It'll be Dr Leiser, a fine neurosurgeon.

782
00:58:00,938 --> 00:58:03,809
- Leiser, good man.
- We can't manage tonight.

783
00:58:03,941 --> 00:58:06,018
There's no crisis in such a thing.

784
00:58:06,152 --> 00:58:08,145
- Any day will do.
- No, it won't.

785
00:58:08,279 --> 00:58:10,770
I'll tell you why and why there is a crisis.

786
00:58:10,907 --> 00:58:13,824
I'm afraid his brain
may be permanently affected.

787
00:58:13,951 --> 00:58:15,327
Insanity?

788
00:58:15,453 --> 00:58:16,828
- Yes.
- Why?

789
00:58:16,954 --> 00:58:21,581
Because his trial is on for tonight.
He hasn't found anyone to defend him.

790
00:58:21,709 --> 00:58:25,789
He spends all his time in my library.
He only sleeps when I drug him.

791
00:58:25,922 --> 00:58:28,164
The boy has a fine mind but it's taxed.

792
00:58:28,299 --> 00:58:30,790
That's the trouble, it's too good a mind.

793
00:58:30,927 --> 00:58:33,881
A weak mind isn't strong enough
to hurt itself.

794
00:58:34,013 --> 00:58:36,765
Stupidity has saved many a man
from going mad.

795
00:58:36,891 --> 00:58:38,469
Yes, you're right there.

796
00:58:38,601 --> 00:58:42,100
He's had several talks
with this heavenly messenger.

797
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:45,681
Hallucinations, but you never saw
such an imagination!

798
00:58:45,817 --> 00:58:50,111
I've been taking tips on the other world -
law, system, architecture.

799
00:58:50,238 --> 00:58:54,236
Interestingly, he never crosses
the limits of his imagination.

800
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:57,736
- I don't get you.
- Nothing he invents is fantastic.

801
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:00,492
It's invention, but logical invention.

802
00:59:00,623 --> 00:59:04,751
The keystone to his invention
is that the trial takes place tonight.

803
00:59:04,877 --> 00:59:07,415
He must win or lose his case tonight.

804
00:59:07,547 --> 00:59:10,880
We ought to operate tonight.
No use shaking your head.

805
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:15,469
We need to find a counsel to save him
losing his case or we may lose him!

806
00:59:34,115 --> 00:59:36,108
What about...

807
00:59:36,242 --> 00:59:37,820
...him?

808
00:59:39,245 --> 00:59:40,823
Lincoln?

809
00:59:40,955 --> 00:59:45,332
No, it's hardly fair to drag him in.
I don't believe he'd be prejudiced.

810
00:59:47,003 --> 00:59:48,580
Plato.

811
00:59:50,173 --> 00:59:52,878
How would you like
to be defended by Plato?

812
00:59:53,009 --> 00:59:55,002
Nobody knew more about reasoning.

813
00:59:55,136 --> 00:59:58,968
He was 81 when he died. He might be
too old to think love important.

814
00:59:59,098 --> 01:00:03,559
Do you think so? Anyhow, Plato had
very elementary ideas about love.

815
01:00:03,686 --> 01:00:06,094
Besides, didn't he quote Sophocles...

816
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:09,896
...when someone asked him
if he could still appreciate a woman?

817
01:00:10,026 --> 01:00:13,774
- What did the old boy say?
- "I'm glad to be rid of all that."

818
01:00:13,905 --> 01:00:17,025
"It's like escaping from bondage
to a raving madman."

819
01:00:17,158 --> 01:00:18,189
Tut!

820
01:00:18,326 --> 01:00:20,817
These Greeks - cold as their marble.

821
01:00:20,953 --> 01:00:25,497
If he had been French... Richelieu,
for example. Irresistible at 80!

822
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:27,416
How about Richelieu?

823
01:00:27,543 --> 01:00:30,959
No, I never liked him much
in "The Three Musketeers".

824
01:00:40,264 --> 01:00:42,423
Solomon.

825
01:00:43,726 --> 01:00:45,185
Solomon?

826
01:00:46,062 --> 01:00:48,019
Non?

827
01:00:48,147 --> 01:00:52,062
Mais, mon Dieu, who do you want?
You have only a few hours left!

828
01:00:52,193 --> 01:00:56,107
It sounds a grand idea to have
all these great men to choose from,...

829
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:59,193
...but what do they know
of our problems today?

830
01:00:59,325 --> 01:01:01,117
True. Very little.

831
01:01:01,244 --> 01:01:04,198
Besides,
I think it ought to be an Englishman.

832
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:07,830
Nobody famous, but somebody
with his head screwed on.

833
01:01:09,711 --> 01:01:11,288
Screwed?

834
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:14,172
- Now, this Abraham... er...?
- Farlan.

835
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:16,042
Was he a famous man?

836
01:01:16,175 --> 01:01:18,631
First American killed by a British bullet.

837
01:01:18,761 --> 01:01:21,513
I mean, was he a great philosopher
or statesman?

838
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:24,474
- He was a schoolteacher.
- There, you see!

839
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,847
Now, Plato would probably talk about
perceptions and causations.

840
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:31,809
Pardon?

841
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:34,728
- Over your head, too?
- Definitely.

842
01:01:34,861 --> 01:01:36,853
It's quite simple...

843
01:01:40,116 --> 01:01:43,865
By the way, why are you so interested
in my winning my case?

844
01:01:43,995 --> 01:01:45,370
I?

845
01:01:45,496 --> 01:01:47,288
Yes, you!

846
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:57,918
And why am I being taken up
this... stairway?

847
01:02:01,429 --> 01:02:03,635
I'm not being taken for a ride, am I?

848
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:07,050
- What a suggestion!
- Take that bit of barley sugar away.

849
01:02:07,185 --> 01:02:11,265
I don't like it or your suggestions!
I'll go back before it's too late.

850
01:02:11,397 --> 01:02:13,390
Peter! Peter!

851
01:02:13,524 --> 01:02:15,102
Peter!

852
01:02:15,234 --> 01:02:16,978
Peter!

853
01:02:17,111 --> 01:02:19,104
Peter...!

854
01:02:19,238 --> 01:02:20,614
Peter!

855
01:02:23,368 --> 01:02:25,360
Peter, come back!

856
01:02:26,537 --> 01:02:28,329
Peter, Peter!

857
01:02:28,456 --> 01:02:29,701
Peter!

858
01:02:29,832 --> 01:02:31,825
Peter, Peter!

859
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,751
Come back!

860
01:02:34,712 --> 01:02:37,713
- Peter!
-  Peter, come back!

861
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,792
Peter, come back!

862
01:02:41,928 --> 01:02:44,549
Peter! Peter, come back!

863
01:02:46,808 --> 01:02:48,800
Peter! Peter!

864
01:02:48,935 --> 01:02:50,726
Come back!

865
01:02:50,853 --> 01:02:52,846
Peter, Peter, come back!

866
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:55,306
Peter! Peter!

867
01:02:55,441 --> 01:02:58,359
Peter, my darling, come back to me!

868
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:07,903
He almost got me!

869
01:03:36,566 --> 01:03:38,558
He'll be all right in a moment.

870
01:03:38,693 --> 01:03:42,144
Why isn't the ambulance here?
It was due half an hour ago.

871
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:46,278
Phone Dr McEwen, say we must
operate tonight. It's life or death.

872
01:03:46,409 --> 01:03:50,870
Tell him about the ambulance.
Telegraph his mother and two sisters.

873
01:03:50,997 --> 01:03:52,989
- Yes, Doctor.
- That's all.

874
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:57,288
Now, Peter...

875
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:00,207
- Where's June?
- Phoning. Back in a moment.

876
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,000
- He almost got me.
- I know.

877
01:04:02,133 --> 01:04:05,051
Crafty beggar.
I got away by the skin of my teeth.

878
01:04:05,178 --> 01:04:08,214
Don't let anybody fool you
into giving up this case!

879
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:11,598
You were promised a fair trial.
Don't give in! Promise?

880
01:04:11,726 --> 01:04:14,217
- Got no counsel.
- We'll find the right man.

881
01:04:14,354 --> 01:04:18,268
- They can't start without counsel.
- They may appoint some stooge.

882
01:04:18,399 --> 01:04:20,558
- Nonsense.
- Or let it go by default.

883
01:04:20,693 --> 01:04:23,730
We'll find somebody.
They can't start till then.

884
01:04:23,863 --> 01:04:25,238
Nobody famous!

885
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:27,772
No, that'd be the worst thing we could do.

886
01:04:27,909 --> 01:04:30,696
- How about a pal of yours?
- Might find somebody.

887
01:04:30,828 --> 01:04:32,655
- Your radio operator?
- Bob?

888
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:34,580
Yes. Think it over.

889
01:04:34,707 --> 01:04:36,747
- You couldn't get through?
- No.

890
01:04:36,876 --> 01:04:39,497
It's the storm.
They always cut the phone off.

891
01:04:39,629 --> 01:04:42,962
- I'll go on my bike.
- No, you're more valuable here.

892
01:04:43,091 --> 01:04:45,795
If the ambulance comes,
don't wait for me.

893
01:04:45,927 --> 01:04:47,919
And if I meet it, I'll come back.

894
01:04:48,054 --> 01:04:50,426
Go to him, don't allow him to despair.

895
01:04:50,556 --> 01:04:52,549
His life is in your hands.

896
01:05:19,294 --> 01:05:22,164
- Where's Frank?
- He won't be long, darling.

897
01:05:22,297 --> 01:05:26,543
I must talk to him.
I don't think Bob's the right man.

898
01:05:26,676 --> 01:05:28,669
I'll tell him you said so.

899
01:05:28,803 --> 01:05:30,677
- Do you know Bob?
- No.

900
01:05:30,805 --> 01:05:32,798
He was my sparks.

901
01:05:34,017 --> 01:05:37,267
- Highly operational type.
- We'll find somebody.

902
01:05:38,938 --> 01:05:42,437
- Time's nearly up.
- Frank'll come up with something.

903
01:05:42,567 --> 01:05:44,358
I wish he'd hurry.

904
01:05:52,493 --> 01:05:54,984
Look out!

905
01:06:02,545 --> 01:06:04,123
Dr Reeves!

906
01:06:10,011 --> 01:06:12,965
Get the fire extinguishers
and the blankets!

907
01:06:21,856 --> 01:06:24,228
- Can I help you, sir?
- Watch the road!

908
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:54,878
He never saw us until it was too late.

909
01:06:55,014 --> 01:06:57,007
He turned off to save us.

910
01:06:57,141 --> 01:06:59,846
Gosh, I feel bad about it.
He was a fine man.

911
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:01,970
You couldn't help it.

912
01:07:02,105 --> 01:07:04,809
He was interested in this case, wasn't he?

913
01:07:04,941 --> 01:07:06,518
Yes.

914
01:07:06,651 --> 01:07:08,940
I saw his notes he left for Dr Leiser.

915
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:11,109
It was a fine piece of diagnosis.

916
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:13,611
He left notes for the operation, too.

917
01:07:13,741 --> 01:07:16,612
- Dr Leiser is very good, isn't he?
- The best.

918
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:21,160
Frank...

919
01:07:23,543 --> 01:07:25,334
I'm here, darling.

920
01:07:26,462 --> 01:07:28,254
Where's Frank?

921
01:07:31,676 --> 01:07:33,669
He's... gone ahead.

922
01:07:37,974 --> 01:07:39,966
He's had an accident.

923
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:46,308
Hasn't he?

924
01:07:48,443 --> 01:07:49,605
Yes,...

925
01:07:49,736 --> 01:07:51,527
...a bad accident.

926
01:07:55,658 --> 01:07:57,450
Is he dead?

927
01:08:00,705 --> 01:08:02,496
Yes, he's dead.

928
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:21,633
All right, boys, step lively.

929
01:08:24,103 --> 01:08:25,895
Okay, Doc.

930
01:08:27,023 --> 01:08:29,016
- Easy.
- All right.

931
01:08:35,239 --> 01:08:37,232
All right, guys, lead the way.

932
01:09:11,901 --> 01:09:14,772
- An atropine injection, Sister?
- Yes, 100.

933
01:09:14,904 --> 01:09:17,940
- Is this the cranial case?
- Yes, that's right.

934
01:09:19,117 --> 01:09:22,283
Hello, Squadron Leader.
We're all ready for you.

935
01:11:05,723 --> 01:11:07,716
- Dr Reeves?
- Yes.

936
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:09,843
Permit me to return your book.

937
01:11:09,978 --> 01:11:11,769
- Ho-ho!
- Ah-ha!

938
01:11:11,896 --> 01:11:15,063
- So it's you!
- I will introduce you to Philidor.

939
01:11:15,191 --> 01:11:18,275
Cher colleague, a special case.
Court of Appeal.

940
01:11:18,444 --> 01:11:21,018
- I will deliver Dr Reeves.
- As you wish.

941
01:11:22,156 --> 01:11:23,734
Merci.

942
01:11:26,285 --> 01:11:28,077
Be of good cheer, friend.

943
01:11:28,204 --> 01:11:31,240
One of the best men in the service.
Your compatriot.

944
01:11:31,374 --> 01:11:33,165
- What's his name?
- John...

945
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:37,160
- Bunyan! Yes, of course!
- And... er... how is dear Peter?

946
01:11:38,089 --> 01:11:40,082
Oh, he has a fighting chance.

947
01:11:40,216 --> 01:11:42,007
Oh-oh.

948
01:11:49,976 --> 01:11:51,968
- Dr Frank Reeves.
- Yes.

949
01:11:52,103 --> 01:11:54,938
You are familiar with
Squadron Leader Carter's case?

950
01:11:55,064 --> 01:11:56,227
I am.

951
01:11:56,357 --> 01:11:58,564
He has chosen you to be his counsel.

952
01:11:59,319 --> 01:12:01,110
I hoped he would.

953
01:12:01,237 --> 01:12:02,945
- Do you accept?
- I do.

954
01:12:03,072 --> 01:12:05,742
You have very little time
to prepare your case.

955
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:07,859
What facilities do you wish?

956
01:12:07,994 --> 01:12:11,445
I should like to see my client
and get his instructions.

957
01:12:11,581 --> 01:12:14,582
I subpoena Flying Officer Trubshaw
as a witness.

958
01:12:14,709 --> 01:12:16,287
Certainly.

959
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:21,710
Conductor 71, you will take Dr Frank
Reeves to Squadron Leader Carter.

960
01:12:45,948 --> 01:12:47,111
Psst!

961
01:13:17,438 --> 01:13:19,561
- Hello, Bob.
- Wotcher, skipper.

962
01:13:19,691 --> 01:13:23,190
I didn't expect to see you - not yet.
Not up there, either.

963
01:13:23,319 --> 01:13:25,312
Well, it was Doc Reeves's idea.

964
01:13:25,446 --> 01:13:27,984
- I subpoenaed him. Let's talk.
- Right.

965
01:13:28,116 --> 01:13:32,030
- You sure they won't miss me?
- Miss you? You know me, mon ami.

966
01:13:32,161 --> 01:13:35,198
That surgeon's very neat,
very neat indeed.

967
01:13:35,331 --> 01:13:36,909
I like his work.

968
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:39,449
- You're in good hands, Peter.
- I know.

969
01:13:39,585 --> 01:13:41,625
- Look...
- I know what's coming.

970
01:13:41,754 --> 01:13:44,376
- Are you sure I'm the best man?
- Quite sure.

971
01:13:44,507 --> 01:13:46,998
Aren't you afraid
I may be out of my depth?

972
01:13:47,135 --> 01:13:49,127
- No.
- Or that I'm no lawyer?

973
01:13:49,262 --> 01:13:50,211
No.

974
01:13:50,346 --> 01:13:54,011
- If he gets onto politics, I'm sunk.
- You must have something.

975
01:13:54,142 --> 01:13:57,926
- Oh, just a little common sense.
- That's rare - it'll do me.

976
01:13:58,062 --> 01:13:59,225
- Say yes!
- Well...

977
01:13:59,355 --> 01:14:02,356
- He has no choice.
- What are we talking about, then?

978
01:14:02,483 --> 01:14:04,476
All right, I need evidence.

979
01:14:10,825 --> 01:14:12,616
Look at her.

980
01:14:12,744 --> 01:14:14,535
Holy smoke!

981
01:14:14,662 --> 01:14:17,497
- What?
- She looks like a nice girl.

982
01:14:17,623 --> 01:14:20,541
- She is a nice girl.
- Hardly your type, skip.

983
01:14:21,753 --> 01:14:23,745
I've fallen in love with her.

984
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,872
Her accent is foreign,...

985
01:14:26,007 --> 01:14:28,000
...but it sounds sweet to me.

986
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:31,965
We were born thousands of miles apart,...

987
01:14:32,096 --> 01:14:34,385
...but we were made for each other.

988
01:14:34,515 --> 01:14:37,137
That's an excellent piece of prose.

989
01:14:37,268 --> 01:14:38,727
Sorry.

990
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:40,846
Nothing to be ashamed of.

991
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,602
May I kiss her? Just in case, you know.

992
01:14:43,733 --> 01:14:46,189
You may, but she will not know it.

993
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:48,110
Doesn't matter.

994
01:14:49,947 --> 01:14:55,072
These English! What is the good of
kissing a girl if she does not feel it?

995
01:15:03,711 --> 01:15:04,874
Look!

996
01:15:05,004 --> 01:15:07,246
- What?
- The evidence you wanted.

997
01:15:08,424 --> 01:15:10,216
Her tears.

998
01:15:11,719 --> 01:15:13,842
Oh, I wish I could take one with me.

999
01:15:13,972 --> 01:15:16,344
You are counsel, you can do as you wish.

1000
01:15:16,474 --> 01:15:19,095
Why don't we wrap it up
and take it with us?

1001
01:15:20,436 --> 01:15:22,014
Permit me.

1002
01:15:29,612 --> 01:15:31,190
That's it.

1003
01:15:31,322 --> 01:15:33,694
The only real bit of evidence we have.

1004
01:15:34,701 --> 01:15:37,405
Quick,
we must not keep the court waiting.

1005
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:08,310
The Court of Appeal
sits to consider the case...

1006
01:18:08,438 --> 01:18:10,596
...of the Department of Records...

1007
01:18:10,732 --> 01:18:14,564
...versus Squadron Leader
Peter David Carter of the RAF.

1008
01:18:14,694 --> 01:18:18,739
He claims negligence and superior
rights and responsibilities...

1009
01:18:18,865 --> 01:18:20,904
...arising out of that negligence.

1010
01:18:21,034 --> 01:18:25,327
He is appealing for remission
of the date of his term on Earth...

1011
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:28,159
...and for a reconsideration of his case.

1012
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:30,912
It has been decided to allow this appeal.

1013
01:18:31,044 --> 01:18:34,792
It is for the jury to decide
whether it shall be successful.

1014
01:18:35,923 --> 01:18:38,877
Owing to the interest aroused
by the case...

1015
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:41,631
...there is an unusually large audience.

1016
01:18:41,763 --> 01:18:45,463
We can, of course, seat everyone
who wishes to be present.

1017
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:50,096
The front rows are reserved for those
with a special interest in the case.

1018
01:18:50,229 --> 01:18:54,938
Members of the jury, do not allow
yourselves to be influenced...

1019
01:18:55,068 --> 01:18:57,060
...by anything but the facts...

1020
01:18:57,195 --> 01:18:59,187
...and by your conscience.

1021
01:18:59,322 --> 01:19:03,735
You'll have assistance from the court
to help you arrive at your verdict.

1022
01:19:05,161 --> 01:19:08,577
The counsel for the prosecution
will take his place.

1023
01:19:34,524 --> 01:19:37,608
The counsel for the defence
will take his place.

1024
01:19:46,661 --> 01:19:49,531
I call upon the prosecution
to open the case.

1025
01:19:54,335 --> 01:19:57,087
Your Honour, members of the jury,...

1026
01:19:57,213 --> 01:19:59,206
...this case has three issues.

1027
01:20:00,174 --> 01:20:03,045
Peter D Carter, an Englishman,...

1028
01:20:03,177 --> 01:20:07,127
...should have died
on the second day of May, 1945,...

1029
01:20:07,265 --> 01:20:11,393
...at ten after four of the clock,
British Double Summer Time.

1030
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,097
Due to an oversight,...

1031
01:20:13,229 --> 01:20:17,606
...which I hasten to state is contrary
to the traditions of a great service,...

1032
01:20:19,652 --> 01:20:21,645
...the defendant did not die.

1033
01:20:21,779 --> 01:20:24,650
Therefore, issue No.1,
who is responsible?

1034
01:20:24,782 --> 01:20:27,653
When summoned to report
20-odd hours later,...

1035
01:20:27,785 --> 01:20:31,237
...the defendant refused to accompany
Conductor 71,...

1036
01:20:31,372 --> 01:20:35,240
...giving as his reason that
in the time which he had borrowed...

1037
01:20:35,376 --> 01:20:38,294
...he had accumulated
new responsibilities...

1038
01:20:38,421 --> 01:20:41,755
...of an allegedly important
and permanent nature.

1039
01:20:41,883 --> 01:20:45,133
He claimed, in fact,
that in these 20 hours...

1040
01:20:45,261 --> 01:20:49,093
...a young lady of good American stock...

1041
01:20:49,223 --> 01:20:51,216
...had fallen in love with him.

1042
01:20:52,018 --> 01:20:54,011
Therefore issue No.2.

1043
01:20:54,145 --> 01:20:56,351
Are we to believe this?

1044
01:20:56,481 --> 01:20:58,723
Furthermore, he states...

1045
01:20:58,858 --> 01:21:00,898
...in these borrowed 20 hours...

1046
01:21:01,027 --> 01:21:03,732
My lord,
I object to the word "borrowed",...

1047
01:21:03,863 --> 01:21:06,484
...which counsel is using so emphatically.

1048
01:21:06,616 --> 01:21:11,194
To borrow means to get temporary use of
something without being the true owner.

1049
01:21:11,329 --> 01:21:16,121
My client didn't get,
he was given the 20 hours in question.

1050
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:18,741
He didn't use something he didn't own.

1051
01:21:18,878 --> 01:21:20,871
He was the owner of his own life.

1052
01:21:22,548 --> 01:21:24,126
The next points are,...

1053
01:21:24,258 --> 01:21:28,719
...is this young Englishman in love
with this girl of American stock?

1054
01:21:28,846 --> 01:21:32,132
Even more important,
is she in love with him?

1055
01:21:32,266 --> 01:21:35,018
Why stress their nationalities?

1056
01:21:35,144 --> 01:21:37,386
Very important, sir. Extremely important.

1057
01:21:37,522 --> 01:21:39,977
- Why?
- Because we are talking of love.

1058
01:21:40,108 --> 01:21:44,485
It can happen between
an Englishman and an American girl.

1059
01:21:44,612 --> 01:21:46,605
And... er... vice versa.

1060
01:21:46,739 --> 01:21:48,317
Possibly.

1061
01:21:48,449 --> 01:21:51,534
But what are these love affairs,
Dr Reeves?

1062
01:21:51,661 --> 01:21:55,279
Men and women thousands of miles
away from home,...

1063
01:21:55,415 --> 01:21:58,285
...away from the love they left behind.

1064
01:21:58,418 --> 01:22:01,502
Minute sparks
instead of scorching flames,...

1065
01:22:01,629 --> 01:22:06,375
...fading, shabby wigs instead of
the rich gold of a woman's hair.

1066
01:22:06,509 --> 01:22:09,380
The love of the moment, Dr Reeves.

1067
01:22:09,512 --> 01:22:11,220
Do I call it love?

1068
01:22:11,347 --> 01:22:14,467
Once in a thousand times, perhaps.

1069
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,471
And how many end in lasting marriage?

1070
01:22:17,603 --> 01:22:19,395
One in ten thousand.

1071
01:22:20,064 --> 01:22:23,065
- My case, sir!
- That, sir, is for you to prove.

1072
01:22:23,192 --> 01:22:27,060
When our men and women came
to your country as your allies,...

1073
01:22:27,196 --> 01:22:29,652
...it was not to become your prisoners.

1074
01:22:29,782 --> 01:22:33,780
May I bring you up to date? We're living
in the 20th century, not the 18th.

1075
01:22:33,911 --> 01:22:35,904
May I bring you up to date, sir?

1076
01:22:36,748 --> 01:22:38,740
We are not alive at all.

1077
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:40,666
Good point.

1078
01:22:40,793 --> 01:22:42,786
And I am up to date, sir.

1079
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:46,040
I've been watching you English
from upstairs.

1080
01:22:46,174 --> 01:22:48,879
Your wars, your politics, your busyness.

1081
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:52,177
From the tax on tea in 1766...

1082
01:22:52,305 --> 01:22:54,297
...to a certain report...

1083
01:22:54,432 --> 01:22:58,809
...on England by five members
of the United States Senate in 1944.

1084
01:22:58,936 --> 01:23:02,436
The defendant has nothing to do
with tea or senators.

1085
01:23:02,565 --> 01:23:04,558
But other Englishmen had, sir.

1086
01:23:04,692 --> 01:23:08,026
Is Peter D Carter
what you'd call a good Englishman?

1087
01:23:08,154 --> 01:23:09,529
Yes, sir.

1088
01:23:10,907 --> 01:23:12,899
Do you see this glass?

1089
01:23:13,034 --> 01:23:17,328
Out of it Benedict Arnold drank
the health of King George III.

1090
01:23:19,916 --> 01:23:23,581
Does it break because it is faulty
or because it is glass?

1091
01:23:25,213 --> 01:23:29,590
Can I tear this paper because it is
defective or because it is paper?

1092
01:23:29,717 --> 01:23:32,043
We are all as God made us, sir,...

1093
01:23:32,178 --> 01:23:35,927
...but our ancestors had a deal to do
in shaping us as well.

1094
01:23:36,057 --> 01:23:37,385
I quite agree.

1095
01:23:37,517 --> 01:23:39,509
The jury will please note that.

1096
01:23:39,644 --> 01:23:43,344
My lord, may I ask where
Mr Farlan's grandfather was born?

1097
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:46,932
- The question is irrelevant.
- Could it have been England?

1098
01:23:47,068 --> 01:23:49,226
You need not answer that question.

1099
01:23:49,362 --> 01:23:51,401
I prefer to answer, Your Honour.

1100
01:23:51,531 --> 01:23:54,982
Grandfather left England, sir,
because he didn't like it.

1101
01:23:55,118 --> 01:23:58,035
Granddad would've liked it
even less today.

1102
01:23:58,162 --> 01:23:59,740
Listen.

1103
01:24:00,915 --> 01:24:02,908
"Well, here we are at Lord's... "

1104
01:24:03,042 --> 01:24:05,664
The voice of England in 1945.

1105
01:24:07,422 --> 01:24:09,960
"And here let me say that the weather...

1106
01:24:10,091 --> 01:24:13,590
...is more like cricket weather -
it's stopped raining. "

1107
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:17,848
"Play has been resumed and
the crowd of about 50,000 people...

1108
01:24:17,974 --> 01:24:21,058
...have discarded their macs
and umbrellas...

1109
01:24:21,185 --> 01:24:26,809
...and settled down to enjoy the game
which to people all over the world...

1110
01:24:26,941 --> 01:24:30,986
...more truly represents all that's English
than anything else. "

1111
01:24:31,112 --> 01:24:34,196
Do you admit that this is
an English voice, sir?

1112
01:24:34,324 --> 01:24:39,069
"Wally Hammond played a delightful... "

1113
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:47,703
The voice of America in 1945.

1114
01:24:47,837 --> 01:24:49,830
# Shoo, shoo, shoo, baby

1115
01:24:52,091 --> 01:24:54,499
# Shoo, shoo, shoo, baby

1116
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:57,209
# Bye, bye, bye, baby

1117
01:24:59,974 --> 01:25:03,343
# Your papa's off to the seven seas

1118
01:25:03,478 --> 01:25:05,470
# Don't cry, baby

1119
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:07,393
# Don't...

1120
01:25:07,523 --> 01:25:10,145
# ...sigh, baby

1121
01:25:10,276 --> 01:25:12,483
# Bye, bye, bye, baby

1122
01:25:14,906 --> 01:25:18,357
# When I come back
we'll have a life of ease...

1123
01:25:18,493 --> 01:25:20,485
I don't understand a word.

1124
01:25:21,913 --> 01:25:23,490
Nor do I.

1125
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:30,457
But for England I'm ready to call
John Donne, Dryden, Pope,...

1126
01:25:30,588 --> 01:25:33,672
...Wordsworth, Coleridge,
Shelley and Keats,...

1127
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,377
...Tennyson, Bridges...

1128
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:38,546
And Milton and Shakespeare.
I concede your point.

1129
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,921
You've already called Peter Carter.

1130
01:25:41,057 --> 01:25:43,928
- Is he a poet?
- He will be if you give him time.

1131
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:47,227
- We are here to decide that, sir.
- I can't deny it.

1132
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:40,817
Can the new world
return to the old?

1133
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:44,449
Should the vibrant humour
of a young American girl...

1134
01:26:44,579 --> 01:26:46,785
...be stifled in the pages of Punch?

1135
01:26:47,498 --> 01:26:49,871
Should the swift tempo of her life...

1136
01:26:50,001 --> 01:26:52,955
...be slowed to the crawl
of a match of cricket?

1137
01:26:53,087 --> 01:26:55,709
Should her accustomed native comfort...

1138
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:59,838
...perforce conform to England's
warm drinks, cold rooms,...

1139
01:26:59,969 --> 01:27:03,469
...draughty windows, smoky chimneys,
faulty plumbing?

1140
01:27:03,598 --> 01:27:07,382
Two million houses have no windows,
frequently no roof or walls.

1141
01:27:07,518 --> 01:27:11,516
This court is concerned with
the life and death of Peter Carter,...

1142
01:27:11,648 --> 01:27:14,435
...not with past history
or present plumbing.

1143
01:27:14,567 --> 01:27:18,185
- Hear, hear!
- Peter Carter's character, sir,...

1144
01:27:18,321 --> 01:27:22,947
...like every other human being was
formed by a chain of circumstances.

1145
01:27:23,076 --> 01:27:26,943
As Benjamin Franklin said,
for want of a nail, the shoe was lost.

1146
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,203
For want of a shoe, the horse was lost.

1147
01:27:29,332 --> 01:27:31,538
For want of a horse, the rider was lost.

1148
01:27:31,668 --> 01:27:33,874
For want of a rider, the message was lost.

1149
01:27:34,003 --> 01:27:38,464
For want of a message, the kingdom
was lost. All for want of a nail!

1150
01:27:39,634 --> 01:27:42,421
You've heard of Benjamin Franklin, sir?

1151
01:27:42,553 --> 01:27:44,546
In George Washington's words,...

1152
01:27:44,681 --> 01:27:47,136
"Labour to keep alive in your breast...

1153
01:27:47,266 --> 01:27:50,885
...that little spark of celestial fire
called conscience."

1154
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:53,690
That could not have been said
by an Englishman.

1155
01:27:53,815 --> 01:27:55,807
What was George Washington?

1156
01:27:56,317 --> 01:27:58,310
Conscience, Mr Farlan.

1157
01:27:58,444 --> 01:28:02,312
Are you insinuating that something
is wrong with my conscience?

1158
01:28:02,448 --> 01:28:04,156
- I am.
- Your Honour, I protest.

1159
01:28:04,283 --> 01:28:08,067
I am trying to give a full picture
of this case to the jury.

1160
01:28:08,204 --> 01:28:10,410
You are trying to prejudice the jury, sir.

1161
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:15,083
I see that they've been selected from
many races, creeds and nationalities.

1162
01:28:15,211 --> 01:28:18,662
I cannot believe them interested
in ancient grudges...

1163
01:28:18,798 --> 01:28:22,249
...nor in present grumblings
about draughty windows.

1164
01:28:22,385 --> 01:28:24,378
I don't need to prejudice the jury.

1165
01:28:24,512 --> 01:28:27,548
They're already prejudiced
and with good reason!

1166
01:28:27,849 --> 01:28:32,178
You can't pick one that isn't.
Look closely at the members of the jury.

1167
01:28:34,272 --> 01:28:37,890
- The first member is...
- Jean-Marie Barault, French!

1168
01:28:38,026 --> 01:28:41,893
Has a century passed without war
between England and France?

1169
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:46,490
- The second member is...
- Gregorius Johannes Bund, sir.

1170
01:28:46,617 --> 01:28:50,283
The Boer War, Dr Reeves.
The third member is...

1171
01:28:50,413 --> 01:28:52,702
- Ivan Berdei, Russki.
- What?

1172
01:28:52,832 --> 01:28:54,623
I am Russian.

1173
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:58,535
The Crimean War, Dr Reeves.
And you, sir?

1174
01:28:58,671 --> 01:29:00,249
Chang Chi Min, Peking.

1175
01:29:00,381 --> 01:29:03,833
Don't forget England's attack
on China in 1857.

1176
01:29:04,135 --> 01:29:06,341
Occupying unprotected Peking.

1177
01:29:06,471 --> 01:29:08,214
And you, sir?

1178
01:29:08,348 --> 01:29:10,554
Raha Tejpalal from the Punjab.

1179
01:29:10,683 --> 01:29:12,972
Think of India, Dr Reeves.

1180
01:29:13,102 --> 01:29:14,894
Think of India.

1181
01:29:15,021 --> 01:29:17,097
And you, sir, you are...?

1182
01:29:17,231 --> 01:29:19,141
James Monaghan, Irish.

1183
01:29:22,570 --> 01:29:25,275
Choose a new jury anywhere, Dr Reeves.

1184
01:29:25,406 --> 01:29:28,740
It will always be prejudiced
against your country.

1185
01:29:28,868 --> 01:29:33,530
My lord, I wish to take counsel
for the prosecution's advice.

1186
01:29:33,665 --> 01:29:37,330
I challenge the jury and request
that a new one be chosen.

1187
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:39,618
Chosen from where, Dr Reeves?

1188
01:29:39,754 --> 01:29:42,245
- Mr Farlan said anywhere.
- Except England.

1189
01:29:42,382 --> 01:29:46,675
Why not? Where else have the rights
of the individual been held so high?

1190
01:29:46,803 --> 01:29:50,752
In America, sir, where these rights
are held to be inalienable!

1191
01:29:50,890 --> 01:29:53,511
I doubt if you have more freedom
than England.

1192
01:29:53,643 --> 01:29:56,893
An Englishman thinks as he likes
in religion and politics.

1193
01:29:57,021 --> 01:30:01,315
It isn't what a man thinks and says,
it's when and where and to whom.

1194
01:30:01,442 --> 01:30:06,816
A man with a flint and steel striking
sparks over a wet blanket is one thing,...

1195
01:30:06,948 --> 01:30:09,818
...but striking them
over a tinderbox is another!

1196
01:30:09,951 --> 01:30:15,158
An American baby sucks in freedom with
the milk of the breast at which he hangs.

1197
01:30:15,289 --> 01:30:19,833
A man can see further, sir,
from the top of Boston State House,...

1198
01:30:19,961 --> 01:30:24,872
...and see more worth seeing than from
the pyramids, turrets and steeples...

1199
01:30:25,008 --> 01:30:27,000
...of all the places of the world.

1200
01:30:27,135 --> 01:30:29,127
No smoke, sir,...

1201
01:30:29,262 --> 01:30:30,970
...no fog, sir,...

1202
01:30:31,097 --> 01:30:35,095
...and a clean sweep from
the outer light and the sea beyond...

1203
01:30:35,226 --> 01:30:37,432
...to the New Hampshire mountains!

1204
01:30:37,562 --> 01:30:40,183
Yes, sir, there are great truths...

1205
01:30:40,315 --> 01:30:43,565
...higher than mountains
and broader than seas...

1206
01:30:43,693 --> 01:30:46,860
...that people look for
from the tops of our hills!

1207
01:30:46,988 --> 01:30:48,980
America, sir,...

1208
01:30:49,115 --> 01:30:52,318
...is the only place
where man is full grown!

1209
01:31:06,549 --> 01:31:09,170
Then I choose a jury of Americans.

1210
01:31:13,056 --> 01:31:17,136
Of Americans, sir, selected from
every walk of American life.

1211
01:31:17,268 --> 01:31:20,435
If one has fought
in the Wars of Independence,...

1212
01:31:20,563 --> 01:31:25,190
...I want one who has fought with us
against our enemies in this century.

1213
01:31:25,401 --> 01:31:29,529
If the third has a mind that can
only think 170 years back,...

1214
01:31:29,656 --> 01:31:33,071
...I want the fourth to be thinking
170 years ahead.

1215
01:31:33,201 --> 01:31:35,407
I cannot deny that I hope,...

1216
01:31:35,536 --> 01:31:39,830
...that I know that this jury will be
prejudiced in favour of my case...

1217
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:44,287
...for I am pleading for the rights of
the individual against the system.

1218
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:47,291
But it is also against the law, Dr Reeves,...

1219
01:31:47,423 --> 01:31:49,630
...the eternal law of the universe.

1220
01:31:49,759 --> 01:31:54,635
Nothing is stronger than the law.
The whole universe is built upon it.

1221
01:31:54,764 --> 01:31:58,429
This is a court of justice, not of law.

1222
01:31:58,559 --> 01:32:03,056
My lord, I ask for a new jury
of American citizens.

1223
01:32:04,899 --> 01:32:06,892
Do you agree, Mr Farlan?

1224
01:32:07,026 --> 01:32:09,398
I'd welcome such a jury, Your Honour.

1225
01:32:09,529 --> 01:32:11,521
The jury will stand.

1226
01:32:14,283 --> 01:32:18,780
The jury will retire
and a new jury will take their place.

1227
01:32:25,128 --> 01:32:27,619
Robert Dupont, American citizen.

1228
01:32:33,386 --> 01:32:36,422
Lt Pete Vandereyk, American citizen.

1229
01:32:41,894 --> 01:32:44,516
Alexander Barbanov, American citizen.

1230
01:32:50,653 --> 01:32:52,693
George Wong, American citizen.

1231
01:32:59,037 --> 01:33:01,029
Jefferson Lincoln Brown,...

1232
01:33:01,164 --> 01:33:03,156
...American citizen.

1233
01:33:06,336 --> 01:33:09,372
Patrick Aloysius Mahoney,
American citizen.

1234
01:33:13,509 --> 01:33:15,502
The jury will be seated.

1235
01:33:16,346 --> 01:33:18,338
Counsel for the defence.

1236
01:33:19,641 --> 01:33:22,262
Here in this rose is my case.

1237
01:33:22,393 --> 01:33:25,478
What is my case?
I entirely agree with Mr Farlan.

1238
01:33:25,605 --> 01:33:29,603
Has Peter Carter fallen in love
during the allotted extra...

1239
01:33:29,734 --> 01:33:31,109
Borrowed.

1240
01:33:31,277 --> 01:33:34,231
...disputed extra 20 hours he had
or hasn't he?

1241
01:33:34,364 --> 01:33:38,444
Has someone - the name is unimportant -
fallen in love with him?

1242
01:33:38,576 --> 01:33:42,111
Now, here are two young people
who would never have met...

1243
01:33:42,246 --> 01:33:44,239
...but for a mistake higher up,...

1244
01:33:44,374 --> 01:33:48,241
...penalised for the most natural
and simple thing in the world.

1245
01:33:48,378 --> 01:33:49,955
They fell in love.

1246
01:33:50,088 --> 01:33:52,080
Here in this tear...

1247
01:33:52,215 --> 01:33:55,631
...are love and truth and friendship.

1248
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:59,509
Those qualities alone
can build a new world today...

1249
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:02,556
...and must build a better one tomorrow.

1250
01:34:02,684 --> 01:34:04,676
That is my case...

1251
01:34:04,811 --> 01:34:09,389
...and, upon it, I demand a verdict
that Peter Carter shall live.

1252
01:34:11,109 --> 01:34:14,857
Your Honour, we feel the defendant
and this young girl...

1253
01:34:14,988 --> 01:34:17,443
...should be given a chance to be heard.

1254
01:34:17,573 --> 01:34:20,325
My lord, nothing is impossible.

1255
01:34:25,123 --> 01:34:27,115
The court will adjourn.

1256
01:35:41,157 --> 01:35:45,618
No reason to be without the dimension
of time. They will not disturb us.

1257
01:35:45,745 --> 01:35:49,446
It would help establish
a true picture of the conditions.

1258
01:35:49,582 --> 01:35:51,290
Very well.

1259
01:35:56,172 --> 01:35:58,745
- I call Squ...
- My diagnosis was right.

1260
01:35:58,883 --> 01:36:04,222
Fine avascular meningeal adhesions
binding the optic nerve to the brain.

1261
01:36:04,347 --> 01:36:06,885
Similar adhesions
between chiasm and brain.

1262
01:36:07,016 --> 01:36:10,385
Did I tell you about my operation?

1263
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:12,726
Dr Reeves, we are not here...

1264
01:36:12,855 --> 01:36:16,604
...to check your diagnosis,
but to question this young man.

1265
01:36:16,734 --> 01:36:18,276
Quite right.

1266
01:36:18,403 --> 01:36:21,320
I call Squadron Leader Peter D Carter.

1267
01:36:23,491 --> 01:36:26,741
- Hello, Peter.
- Hello, Frank. How's the op going?

1268
01:36:26,869 --> 01:36:29,657
- Fine. Leiser's a good man.
- He'd better be!

1269
01:36:29,789 --> 01:36:32,541
Peter Carter,
you are on the witness stand.

1270
01:36:32,667 --> 01:36:35,917
- You are under oath, understand?
- Yes, Mr Farlan.

1271
01:36:36,045 --> 01:36:38,619
- You know me, sir?
- No mistaking you.

1272
01:36:41,843 --> 01:36:44,215
Your smile is not unattractive, sir.

1273
01:36:44,345 --> 01:36:47,595
Did you use it to enamour
this young American lady?

1274
01:36:47,724 --> 01:36:50,262
- I love her, sir.
- Answer the question.

1275
01:36:50,393 --> 01:36:53,928
Would you repeat the question?
It had "enamoured" in it.

1276
01:36:54,063 --> 01:36:56,056
Never mind the exact question.

1277
01:36:56,190 --> 01:37:00,140
Did you consciously try to influence
the emotions of this American lady?

1278
01:37:00,278 --> 01:37:03,777
- We fell in love before we met.
- You claim you love her.

1279
01:37:03,906 --> 01:37:05,780
- I do.
- Can you prove it?

1280
01:37:06,075 --> 01:37:08,697
Well, give me time, sir. 50 years will do.

1281
01:37:08,828 --> 01:37:10,536
But can you prove it?

1282
01:37:10,663 --> 01:37:14,163
Can a starving man prove he's hungry
except by eating?

1283
01:37:14,292 --> 01:37:16,284
Would you die for her?

1284
01:37:16,419 --> 01:37:18,328
I would!

1285
01:37:18,463 --> 01:37:20,669
But... er... I'd rather live.

1286
01:37:22,258 --> 01:37:23,836
Young devil!

1287
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:26,922
Your Honour,
I apologise for the expression.

1288
01:37:27,055 --> 01:37:29,462
- Your witness.
- No questions.

1289
01:37:29,599 --> 01:37:31,556
Conductor 71.

1290
01:37:31,684 --> 01:37:34,389
- Monsieur?
- Is the young lady available?

1291
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:36,430
She sleeps.

1292
01:37:36,564 --> 01:37:38,640
Sleeps? The jury will note that.

1293
01:37:38,775 --> 01:37:40,767
I put her to sleep.

1294
01:37:40,902 --> 01:37:42,479
Indeed? Why?

1295
01:37:42,612 --> 01:37:44,604
To enable you to call her, sir.

1296
01:37:44,739 --> 01:37:46,732
The jury will please note that.

1297
01:37:46,866 --> 01:37:48,859
I do call her, Your Honour.

1298
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:59,081
You are before the High Court
in the case of Peter Carter.

1299
01:37:59,212 --> 01:38:02,628
You have been called as a witness
by the prosecution.

1300
01:38:03,257 --> 01:38:05,250
You will tell the truth.

1301
01:38:05,385 --> 01:38:09,050
This gentleman
is counsel for the prosecution.

1302
01:38:11,432 --> 01:38:13,425
Child, where were you born?

1303
01:38:13,559 --> 01:38:15,137
In Boston, sir.

1304
01:38:15,269 --> 01:38:18,436
- Do you know this man?
- I think so.

1305
01:38:18,564 --> 01:38:21,565
- You think so?
- I only met him a few days ago.

1306
01:38:21,693 --> 01:38:23,685
You hardly know him.

1307
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:26,145
How can you think you love him?

1308
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:28,273
- But I do love him.
- Nonsense.

1309
01:38:28,408 --> 01:38:31,362
I object.
Counsel will withdraw the expression.

1310
01:38:31,494 --> 01:38:34,614
It's all right, he's right.
There's no sense in love.

1311
01:38:35,957 --> 01:38:38,163
Wisdom still flowers in Boston.

1312
01:38:39,752 --> 01:38:43,750
- Can you prove that you love him?
- How can I?

1313
01:38:43,881 --> 01:38:46,088
Would you be willing to die for him?

1314
01:38:46,217 --> 01:38:47,166
Yes.

1315
01:38:48,761 --> 01:38:51,881
Would you take his place
in the balance sheet?

1316
01:38:52,015 --> 01:38:53,473
- Yes.
- Don't believe her!

1317
01:38:53,599 --> 01:38:55,592
- Stand aside!
- You've no right!

1318
01:38:55,727 --> 01:38:58,562
- How dare you address me like that!
- You must obey.

1319
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:00,562
Of all the dirty tricks!

1320
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:04,189
- This is contempt of court!
- Don't answer any more questions.

1321
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:08,447
Do you realise you've forfeited
any chance of winning your case?

1322
01:39:08,573 --> 01:39:10,565
You won't get June as well!

1323
01:39:11,659 --> 01:39:16,321
Your Honour, members of the jury...
I'm afraid he really does love her.

1324
01:39:16,456 --> 01:39:17,831
Your witness.

1325
01:39:21,669 --> 01:39:24,291
June, you know me well.
Do you trust me?

1326
01:39:24,422 --> 01:39:26,047
Yes, Frank, I trust you.

1327
01:39:26,174 --> 01:39:30,088
It is absolutely necessary you take
Peter's place in the other world.

1328
01:39:30,219 --> 01:39:31,678
Have you gone mad?!

1329
01:39:31,804 --> 01:39:35,387
If you love him, step onto
this staircase and come with us.

1330
01:39:35,516 --> 01:39:38,553
- You are mad!
- It is the only way to prove your love.

1331
01:39:38,686 --> 01:39:40,228
- I do love him.
- No!

1332
01:39:40,355 --> 01:39:42,478
- I ask you to restrain him.
- Granted.

1333
01:39:42,607 --> 01:39:43,982
June.

1334
01:39:51,074 --> 01:39:53,066
Take care, Dr Reeves.

1335
01:39:53,201 --> 01:39:57,068
In the whole universe
nothing is stronger than the law.

1336
01:40:03,795 --> 01:40:05,337
Goodbye, darling.

1337
01:40:30,613 --> 01:40:34,860
Yes, Mr Farlan, nothing is stronger
than the law in the universe,...

1338
01:40:34,993 --> 01:40:37,863
...but on Earth
nothing is stronger than love.

1339
01:40:46,462 --> 01:40:50,460
Members of the jury,
as Sir Walter Scott is always saying,...

1340
01:40:50,591 --> 01:40:54,257
..."In peace, love tunes
the shepherd's reed,...

1341
01:40:54,387 --> 01:40:57,174
...in war,
he mounts the warrior's steed."

1342
01:40:57,307 --> 01:41:00,224
"In halls, in gay attire is seen,...

1343
01:41:00,351 --> 01:41:03,021
...in hamlets, dances on the green."

1344
01:41:03,146 --> 01:41:06,431
"Love rules the court, the camp,
the grove...

1345
01:41:06,566 --> 01:41:08,772
...and men below and saints above."

1346
01:41:08,901 --> 01:41:12,152
"For love is heaven,
and heaven is love."

1347
01:41:12,989 --> 01:41:15,527
Will you please consider your verdict?

1348
01:41:17,618 --> 01:41:19,991
Case for the defendant, Your Honour.

1349
01:41:20,121 --> 01:41:21,699
Bravo!

1350
01:41:21,831 --> 01:41:23,824
The appeal is granted.

1351
01:41:23,958 --> 01:41:28,170
There now remains the new date
on Squadron Leader Carter's file.

1352
01:41:28,296 --> 01:41:30,288
Will both counsel approve it?

1353
01:41:33,343 --> 01:41:37,257
- Does that satisfy you, Dr Reeves?
- Very generous, my lord.

1354
01:41:37,388 --> 01:41:39,381
Do you agree, Mr Farlan?

1355
01:41:40,141 --> 01:41:43,676
Isn't that a little too much, Your Honour?
I agree.

1356
01:41:43,811 --> 01:41:48,058
My lord, I hope this will not
establish a precedent.

1357
01:41:48,191 --> 01:41:50,183
- I object!
- Er, you, sir.

1358
01:41:50,318 --> 01:41:53,105
- You, sir.
- The rights of the common man...

1359
01:41:53,237 --> 01:41:55,444
- The uncommon man.
- Exactly!

1360
01:41:55,573 --> 01:41:59,238
The rights of the uncommon man
must always be respected.

1361
01:41:59,369 --> 01:42:01,160
Exactly!

1362
01:42:08,962 --> 01:42:10,753
Keep his head firm.

1363
01:42:11,464 --> 01:42:14,169
- Tell the nurse I'll send the notes.
- Yes, sir.

1364
01:42:17,887 --> 01:42:20,722
- Congratulations.
- An interesting case.

1365
01:42:28,356 --> 01:42:29,934
Peter,...

1366
01:42:30,066 --> 01:42:32,901
...don't forget your book.

1367
01:43:06,352 --> 01:43:07,930
Frank...

1368
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:10,939
Frank...

1369
01:43:13,109 --> 01:43:14,687
Frank.

1370
01:43:30,543 --> 01:43:32,002
Hello.

1371
01:43:33,087 --> 01:43:34,546
Hello.

1372
01:43:34,672 --> 01:43:36,831
We won.

1373
01:43:36,966 --> 01:43:38,959
I know, darling.

1374
