1
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,857
A mark of the music
just for the hand

2
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:05,727
You speak movements
New designs, Ekabell

3
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,427
You show arms
and don't be afraid to fall

4
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,699
You show energy
and I want to see space

5
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:19,801
And the gorbe arm
back, more back

6
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:24,280
Foot and over your foot, try

7
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,042
more...

8
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,620
That's good, good, Bunny

9
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:32,020
That's better
try the second step first

10
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:35,616
yeah, more
good, that's better

11
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,751
Well, do I look?

12
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,454
Yeah, It's over
And use you body

13
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,759
trying once

14
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,927
yeah, more, and look out
over your hands

15
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,561
Good

16
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:55,279
Doesrt work...

17
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,146
Ok, stop...

18
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,448
The dance is
dedicated to freedom

19
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,887
To every kind of freedom

20
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:07,959
Fill me upon
the flarehead before...

21
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,927
Here we go again

22
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,857
Amsterdam especially
has kept strong ties

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,524
with the liberators

24
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,694
How strong was shown
on Liberation Day 1980...

25
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,830
when the population of the
capital honored them again

26
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,206
It was like the 1945
"May Days" again

27
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,212
Only the soldiers were now
35 years older

28
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,312
Amsterdam was thanking with
its cheers for the Canadians

29
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,785
all the allies who ended five
years of war and occupation

30
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:41,952
These were my heroes
the liberators of 1945

31
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:48,000
When they came back in 1980

32
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,931
it was scary

33
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,961
It didn't look like my memory
anymore

34
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,006
Could you be a bit more
explicit?

35
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,302
Mark, shut up

36
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:01,777
What I see takes me back
to 1980

37
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,712
which also takes me back
to 1945

38
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,751
It is a memory of memories

39
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:11,323
It's the essence of what
I mean in this choreography

40
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,789
and I don't see it, I...

41
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,555
Am I make myself clear?

42
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,187
Ok, we start from second times

43
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,926
The girls on the floor
You on the middle

44
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,298
Just before around the same

45
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:28,840
And that's try the lift
you practiced this morning

46
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,332
come on

47
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,606
You wrong
this different from before

48
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,820
yeah, I'm afraid of it

49
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,089
Could you search original idea
for ones, please

50
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,066
I resisted the motion

51
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,566
It's your dancers the same my being so clear

52
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,163
you never... explain
yourself probably

53
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,402
You can't doing
that's your dancers, period it

54
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,172
thank you very much

55
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,909
Maybe so...

56
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,887
Yes, no...
there is something else

57
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,424
Lifesavers

58
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,553
Yes, Lifesavers
you know those candies

59
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:33,264
The Americans, the Canadians
had them in 1945

60
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,739
I want to know the color
of the wrapper

61
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,969
Sweet, baby

62
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,079
Bye

63
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,710
Yes. That's him
yes

64
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,147
He changes your whole life?

65
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,224
Yes

66
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,020
He was my stepfather
he was on the war

67
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,628
My hero

68
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,494
Is this you?

69
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,498
No, this is you

70
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,034
Little prince

71
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,375
Do you still remember me?

72
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,507
I have to pee

73
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:31,714
Not over there
Have you gone crazy?

74
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,952
Where else?
You were there that time

75
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,830
stay

76
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,699
I have to go back inside

77
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,669
Yes, I know

78
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:52,038
but I wanted to ask you
something else

79
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,028
Are you alright?

80
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,003
You'll get enough to eat
over there

81
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:31,514
Promise me you'll behave

82
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,386
Here, look after this

83
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,275
Here, write your name on it
properly

84
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,356
Young man, come here

85
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,427
Here is your sign
write your name here

86
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:21,466
So, and one for you
Write your name here

87
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,290
You are too late

88
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,915
Here, this is give you

89
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,562
Jan

90
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,573
So, they're going to
fatten you up too

91
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,855
Nerve gas

92
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,480
Keep quiet
and you'll be alright

93
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,986
You, Heinrich, come here

94
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,303
Ok, go over there

95
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,373
You are much too late

96
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,143
(foreign language)

97
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,049
Thanks, bye

98
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,602
Holly shit

99
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:53,378
Did you pee your pants?

100
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,317
Go away, disgusting

101
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,387
What is your name?

102
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,354
Gertie

103
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,157
You know what?

104
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,285
From now on you're called
Dirty Gertie

105
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,261
Shove off. Move over

106
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,734
Right, that's much better

107
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,735
We'll stick together, Ok?

108
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:21,939
I mean when we get there

109
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,177
Just like fucking?

110
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,463
We won't let them
separate us, no way

111
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,907
We thank you, Lord

112
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,705
for bringing these poor
children

113
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:32,409
who need your protection

114
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,143
Amen

115
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,682
Well, I'm sure you
want a cup of warm milk

116
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,318
And you as well?

117
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,157
Nice
Nice, isn't it?

118
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,629
Nice and warm

119
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,826
Take off your cap

120
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,669
Go and sit over there

121
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,906
We'll get the lice out

122
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,187
Children, now you will
go to your new homes

123
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,085
Sjoerd Dotinga
can you take two children?

124
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:17,491
Kees Brinkman and Tom Ophuis

125
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,423
So, Arjen Boersma

126
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,228

And Jungluca

133

134
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,527
Come in

135
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,207
A mistake?

136
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,978
Yes, it can happen

137
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:17,179
We asked for a girl
You know, for Elly...

138
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,290
Right, come with me

139
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,833
They mixed up two, Ma

He was left, this is Jeroen

Alright, we'll have to make
do with him, won't we lad?

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,943
Jeroen
that's a beautiful name

143
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,639
You're not scared of me
are you?

144
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,490
Can I have a look?

145
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:26,955
Lovely...

146
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,918
Henk

147
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,859
This is Jeroen

148
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,295
He'll have to wear
your clothes

149
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,060
Fine

150
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,398
You must be hunger
after such a long journey

151
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,301
No, Mrs.

152
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,068
But you wouldn't say no
to a "bolle"?

153
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:44,868
Bolle?

154
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,001
Slice of bread

155
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,815
It's gone

156
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,010
What's gone?

157
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,518
My ration card

158
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,680
What's a ration card, Ma?

159
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,525
Almighty God, Our Lord
we beg you

160
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:07,826
protect Your weak children

161
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,902
and lead us all to
Your safe harbor

162
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,301
Lord, bless this meal, Amen

163
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,809
I hope you'll enjoy it

164
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,826
blast. Ma

165
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,630
What's the matter?
He's pissed the bed

166
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:50,105
Be quiet, watch your mouth

167
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:17,333
Amsterdam is that way

168
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,709
And the pump is next
to the house

169
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,490
Ma?

170
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,859
Do you all pee the bed
in Amsterdam?

171
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,731
What?

172
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,732
Do you all pee the bed
in Amsterdam?

173
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:59,605
You mean, that was an accident

174
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,147
Can I go first?

175
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,962
Look here

176
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,826
This is how you do it

177
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,737
Pull harder

178
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,375
Havert you done this before?

179
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,142
I've done a lot of rowing

180
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,748
Eels won't bite you, Sissy

181
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:49,526
The Wrath of God
will smite the Godless

182
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:54,155
they will be exiled
to the outermost darkness

183
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,895
there shall be a walling
and a gnashing of teeth

184
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:05,203
So dear Congregation
it is written

185
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:10,941
Lord God, let your light
shine over this world

186
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,849
the light of Liberation

187
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:19,321
Breathe deeply

188
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:26,091
It must reach your lungs

189
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:29,132
It's really healthy

190
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,909
And Abraham made haste to
the tent of Sara, and sayeth

191
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:50,488
Make haste. Take the
three bushels of grain

192
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:54,319
I'm going home

193
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,794
Take the little boat

194
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,898
Henk will help you

195
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:28,350
Hold it firm

196
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,827
Come down, Jeroen
We need your help

197
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,605
Still some way to go

198
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,738
There it is

199
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,908
Here it comes

200
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:04,728
Come and clean it up
here, take it

201
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:14,638
And he sayeth, Jonathan

202
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:21,201
And bring David, in order that
the King could kill David

203
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:28,146
And then?

204
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,345
Jan

205
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,552
Jeroen

206
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,522
Haidie

207
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:47,369
Perhaps they read
another Bible in Amsterdam

208
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,307
You do it, go ahead

209
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,140
It tickles

210
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,185
In the bucket, put it in

211
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,015
There you are

212
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,316
Jan

213
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,754
Mister. I'm Jan

214
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,725
A friend of
Jeroers from Amsterdam

215
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,034
I have to keep an eye on him

216
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,969
Your ration card

217
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,699
I found it

218
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,036
You can't use it here anyhow

219
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,839
Yes, I know

220
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,277
Found it?

221
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,189
Old Pronk says your Dad

222
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:41,656
is the best eel-fisher
in the whole area

223
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:49,222
Have you ever seen her naked

224
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,303
or in her knickers?

225
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,371
Bondien, I mean

226
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:05,808
If there were no Jerries
I'd still be in Amsterdam

227
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,293
They should hang them all

228
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,854
You mustrt hate the Germans

229
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,694
Your mustrt harbour hatred

230
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,597
that's what Dad says

231
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:28,399
Hatred is a sin
or something like that

232
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,973
I want to go home

233
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,441
Amsterdam is that way

234
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,068
Take the little boat

235
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,841
You think you're funny?

236
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,087
Shall we escape?

237
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,418
One night?

238
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,057
Jeroen

239
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,397
back home?

240
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,806
Keep still

241
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:11,077
Come on young man

242
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,843
You out and Elly in

243
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:19,219
Nice and warm

244
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,456
Look

245
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,767
Stop it, Elly
That's enough

246
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:37,003
Elly, that's enough

247
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,474
That's enough

248
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:48,216
Dear Mum and Dad

249
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:53,484
I'm fine. Enough food at last
I miss you both

250
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,189
Hurry up

251
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:58,715
Jeroen...

252
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,011
Jeroen, come

253
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,210
Jeroen, come

254
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:06,256
it's dangerous there
Quicksand

255
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,256
Come back

256
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,197
Idiot, you could be hurt

257
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,963
Come back

258
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:24,733
Go over there

259
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,241
I don't allowed you come here
next time

260
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,141
Idiot

261
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,069
Come on, show me your plane

262
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,733
Not this boat, it's Dad's

263
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,278
Come on, stop moaning

264
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,612
Not so hard

265
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,762
We should have waited for Henk

266
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:24,858
Mama's boy You should have
brought your little sisters

267
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,808
Catch

268
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:12,439
when I pull twice on the rope
pull me up

269
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,812
Understood?

270
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,927
43,44,45...

271
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:34,130
46,47,48...

272
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:43,845
Jan. Jan, come on. Jan

273
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:54,118
Dammit, eels everywhere
as thick as my wrist

274
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:56,043
I do nothing all day
but clean up shit

275
00:30:56,187 --> 00:31:01,625
sheep shit, goat turds
cows hit

276
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,227
All sorts of shit

277
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,627
and they shit harder
than I can clean

278
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:13,628
and that's what keeps nature
growing and blooming?

279
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:17,104
The things we eat, yuk

280
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:26,109
know what you're thinking of

281
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:34,623
The big escape... True?
True?

282
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:43,890
Row back home
just along the coast. Easy

283
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:47,402
Well forget it, I'm not in

284
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,935
Come on, boy

285
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,169
Watch out. Mercy

286
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:59,375
Mercy. Fight
boy. Say it

287
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,321
Do you get a hard-on
sometimes?

288
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,400
A hard-on?
Oh yes, of course

289
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,934
Liar

290
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:22,097
Have you gone nuts or what?

291
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,229
How did you know we are here

292
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:26,832
Turn it on and go home

293
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:39,614
What did you see?

294
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,486
Why ask him?

295
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,026
So, what was it?

296
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,723
Wouldrt you like to know?

297
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,560
Secret, Jeroen?
I'll tell you later

298
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,692
I will tell you later

299
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,138
Those bloody Jerries

300
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,743
they should be smoked cut

301
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,608
The Americans have already
crossed the river Meuse

302
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:30,325
Stop, These bikes are complete

303
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,066
Come on Elly

304
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,833
go home, we'll keep going

305
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:41,509
Bloody Jerries
If I catch them...

306
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,625
They must be running
into the field

307
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,762
There's Dad's boat

308
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,627
Are we going the right way
Jan?

309
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,966
Be quiet

310
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,735
Are you sure?

311
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:16,142
Course, You see
it's getting better already

312
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,008
Let's get out of here

313
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:27,682
We're liberated
The war is over

314
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,205
Call that an army?

315
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,401
The Yanks
have women soldiers, too

316
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,943
I saw in pictures

317
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,979
They wear skirts very tight

318
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:36,776
But how can they fight?

319
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,015
Women aren't there to fight

320
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,932
Are you coming, Jan?

321
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,453
Here, take it

322
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:27,796
It doesn't work

323
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,100
I don't know
what's wrong with it

324
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,642
Did you check this fuse?

325
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,803
I don't know

326
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,490
You have old enough to know
right?

327
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,497
And you are real wise guy, too

328
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:58,761
anyway, listen to
all nice people

329
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,894
you say good night

330
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,630
good night

331
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,263
ok, that's quiet for me

332
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,810
Anyway, without
further introduction

333
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:08,877
Ladies and gentlemen

334
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,607
all the way from Canada
and sing for you tonight

335
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,775
our own... inevitable...
Harmonizes

336
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:18,145
Thank you the way, boys

337
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,876
You call them soldiers?

338
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:48,177
Don't doubt
Just look

339
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:02,930
Master, "sh'boom"
what does that mean?

340
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,677
Cigratte?
Cigratte

341
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:24,845
yeah

342
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:28,220
Sure, here

343
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:45,174
Pastor, "Sh'boom"
doesn't mean anything

344
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,609
Guess, he doesn't smoke

345
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,589
What are you thinking of?

346
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,840
Get on

347
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,758
Are you making fun with me?

348
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:57,130
I'm Walt, Walt

349
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,700
What's your name?

350
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,997
Jeroen

351
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,299
Jeoroen

352
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,407

353
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:07,237
Jeroen

355
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,622
Really small?

356
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,521
Just like little foot

357
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,118
You know Galileo Travels?

358
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:28,424
What is the name of place
the Giant live?

359
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:32,023
It was... Bradingo?

360
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,103
Bradinlan...

361
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:11,065
Couldrt you assholes wait?

362
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,075
That was probably fuck up
for good

363
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:02,281
Jeroen...

364
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,592
Jeroen

365
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,401
There you are

366
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,680
No car

367
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:33,418
I'll walk you home

368
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,206
Walt

369
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,279
Come and sit down

370
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:32,211

You all sit down

372
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:43,352
Idiots

373
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,182
All they understanding

374
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,148
Would have everybody know

375
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:13,486
(Warning)

376
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,484
Jeroen

377
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:19,653
No mind
here, come

378
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:27,867
You... a soldier

379
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,632
Yes, I'm a soldier

380
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:31,570
Hold on

381
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,009
And you know what?
I hated the army

382
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,485
But I just doing that
just like...

383
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:51,060
My mother was proud of me

384
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:53,726
She cried

385
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:57,933
My father, he just
call me an idiot

386
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,127
And he start crying, too

387
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,030
War and me

388
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:09,976
I'm very happy so far

389
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:16,379
And I saw you
I sure you was different

390
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,118
I sure you may a kind guy

391
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:27,488
So what guy are you?

392
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,901
You special, Jeroen

393
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,968
You are really fuck special

394
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:44,010
Look there. Walt

395
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:57,193
The only ship I knew my home
by father in the bottle

396
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:00,689
Have you look telescope before?

397
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:07,663
You know sometime you can see
the face the enemy with it

398
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,064
Look the same face as us

399
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,540
But around in other side

400
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:18,574
That's not a good idea

401
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:23,152
Look there, a plane

402
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,913
That's our plane

403
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:30,254
Two seats, too slow

404
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,362
Poor guys

405
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:38,901
You and me... Sunday...
after Church?

406
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:42,335
Go to look at the plane

407
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:46,932
What did he say?

408
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:25,343
Forget it

409
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:26,915
They took the key away

410
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,642
Shit

411
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:31,913
I giving something inside room
you wait here

412
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,659
Shut up

413
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,558
Want to play?
Ok

414
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,863
That's fifty-fifty

415
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,601
Wait a minute

416
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,301
You try this
finest Virginia leaves

417
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,409
you'll never taste better

418
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,723
hello

419
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,801
How's my buddy?

420
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:13,539
Walt?

421
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:16,513
What is "buddy"?

422
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:21,249
"Buddy", that's you
That's best friend

423
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:57,218
My baby...

424
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,688
You know "Baby"?

425
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:04,959
No

426
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:09,731
I just...
you are my baby

427
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:44,568
He drove the fucking jeep

428
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,570
What does he say?

429
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,338
Maybe we have to walk home

430
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,276
Jeroen

431
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,731
Are you so cold?

432
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,032
You know how cold it is?

433
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,638
I've got a secret

434
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:21,641
Me too. Mine first

435
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:22,437
ok

436
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:25,275
Push and pull... your dick

437
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,144
I can join the Yanks

438
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:31,720
Then I'll see something
Coca Cola, fucking, so on

439
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:34,085
And go to Jerryland?
Not me

440
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,749
The water hurts my soar. Damn

441
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:45,330
Has it already healed?
Show me

442
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:51,538
first pay
like with a tart

443
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:53,699
So what's your secret?

444
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:54,810
No, not now
Tell it, boy

445
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:55,239
Speaking

446
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:58,973
Too late, Winne too said
but the Sperm already went ahead

447
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:03,711
Tell it, tell it or beg for mercy
No, never

448
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,651
Jeroen, come on
we've to go to Church

449
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:12,159
Push and pull, push and pull

450
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:20,363
We must believe the Bible

451
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:28,274
Those are ours

452
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:34,714
Thank you bring the freedom

453
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:38,412
thank you, Amen

454
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,922
thank you

455
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,254
Before we close this
Thanksgiving service

456
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:47,955
I want to give you
a word of warning

457
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:53,091
concerning the new guests here

458
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:57,332
our brave liberators

459
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:01,035
These healthy young lads

460
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:04,772
We have the side of the weak

461
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:10,147
The body has attractive
with us

462
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:14,723
Dear believers, be watchful

463
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:18,885
Protect your family
and daughter

464
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:23,729
Let us look to Him
our shepherd

465
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:28,804
He'll lead us from traps

466
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:33,341
drive the plage away

467
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:37,674
as He saved His Egyptian sons

468
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:42,410
so will there be salvation
for us

469
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:44,144
The old scripture tells
of this in the Revelations

470
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:47,120
And so let us serve the Lord...

471
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:50,522
The Lord is my shepherd...

472
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:54,781
Do you remember
what we make yesterday?

473
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,324
Do you remember? At beach
Yes

474
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,951
You still want to go see that
Yes

475
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:05,691
I'll meet you later
at the beach

476
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:12,173
see you

477
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:19,073
I have to...
You better come here

478
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,953
I've seen it Jeroen

479
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,753
and I noticed it earlier

480
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,122
We're not used to
that kind of thing here

481
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:41,302
Come on

482
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,674
It's wrong to keep the candy
you're given for yourself

483
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,710
The Lord says

484
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,074
Give unto your neighbor

485
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:54,615
and you shall receive
the Kingdom of God

486
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:31,383
You're right
It's hard to get in there

487
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:39,728
There are bodies down there
you know that?

488
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:42,864
They are holding
the seat belts

489
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:45,900
Still in parachute side

490
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:50,434
Do you understand, Jeroen?

491
01:01:50,573 --> 01:01:52,598
Do you understand me?

492
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:10,287
Look, fish...

493
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:13,827
I should stay there

494
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:15,590
You see the plane was there

495
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,996
And when the current goes
it moves

496
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:19,328
And it sinks again

497
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:22,768
just like submarine
you know

498
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,704
Don't be scary
I'd take care of you

499
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:28,708
I'll right here

500
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:32,409
Don't rushing

501
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:37,417
You gonna like go smoothly
That's right

502
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:39,851
Now, smile

503
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:44,549
You got treat it gently
like a horse

504
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:48,330
Watch the breaks

505
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:57,031
Here they are

506
01:02:58,508 --> 01:02:59,941
Crazy

507
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:06,372
Right, baby, kick
I love you

508
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,350
Check of the couple bodies
sign up the wreck

509
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:11,715
I want you ready for
a could pick them up, ok?

510
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:13,378
Aye, sir

511
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:17,893
Ran over my toes

512
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,507
You making fun with me

513
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:42,379
Cut it out

514
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:47,615
my button, my button

515
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:53,587
No

516
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:00,196
Where is it?

517
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:08,372
Don't worry, I fixed

518
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,445
I promise

519
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:27,220
I love you

520
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:32,324
My prince

521
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:39,473
You are mine

522
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,690
Come on

523
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:24,904
What did you favorite?

524
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,416
We do like this

525
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:32,009
one, two, three, four

526
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:34,213
And than say ok

527
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:38,851
one, two three, four
chocolate

528
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:59,277
I wish I were a boy

529
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:03,818
my Dad and Mum here asked for
a boy from Amsterdam

530
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,325
one, two, three, four

531
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,995
Please, don't forget your name
on the top

532
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,199
And we'll title it
"The Liberation"

533
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:27,934
when you're ready

534
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:29,874
make a nice drawing with it

535
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:31,809
Try to write neatly

536
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:35,405
You've got all afternoon
children

537
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:39,112
Write what the Liberation
means for you

538
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:42,281
The re-gaining of Freedom

539
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:46,794
the victory over evil

540
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:51,866
Not everyone in history
can be witness

541
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:54,697
to such an important event

542
01:07:54,837 --> 01:08:04,109
For me, Liberation means

543
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:31,996
Have you heard news
from home yet, Jeroen?

544
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:37,467
How are your parents?

545
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,775
There is enough food
in Amsterdam now, son

546
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,741
Don't worry

547
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:45,711
The whole Netherlands
are liberated

548
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,408
This is a historical moment

549
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:51,577
Maybe the most important
in your life

550
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,985
You won't ever forget that
young man?

551
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:56,887
No, sir

552
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,050
You can go now, son

553
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,456
Yes, sir

554
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:01,126
Bye, Jeroen

555
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:02,696
Bye, sir

556
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:11,030
At last
Get your clogs and come along

557
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:14,370
We waited specially for you
Walt said to

558
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,104
Moving, the young

559
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:21,713
Dad, what's a photo?
A picture

560
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,978
Moving a bit, little more

561
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:27,417
Henk

562
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:31,549
Here Ma, your high heels

563
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:34,219
You ok?

564
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,024
You stand there

565
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:38,258
Smile, Jeroen

566
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,458
You are not here

567
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:41,570
That's me, there

568
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:43,831
You see, me

569
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,601
yeah, that's him

570
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:52,544
Catch

571
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:02,890
Put it at his neck
you will be remember

572
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,655
Really?

573
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:18,769
Walt, this is very special

574
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:20,204
yeah, come on, Walt

575
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:25,507
Come on, everyone smile

576
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,538
You have beautiful hands
Jeroen

577
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:56,368
You could be an artist

578
01:11:57,579 --> 01:12:00,275
You could be painter or sculptor

579
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:07,118
You know? When I was your age
I was in American

580
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:09,719
We just have neighbor

581
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:12,526
Tell you and said

582
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:16,188
My hands make with my mind creative

583
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:19,056
You are like them

584
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:22,034
Shut up, I busying

585
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:24,999
You know?

586
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:29,474
Life's worse then you dead

587
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:32,273
I left

588
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:39,110
You make me happy, Jeroen
just past these days

589
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:42,783
Do't do that, Jeroen

590
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:46,753
Shit

591
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:52,162
Throw away

592
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:58,069
don't worry, you and me
always on, yes?

593
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:02,041
Yeah, we make ones, sometime

594
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:33,498
It's late

595
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:37,806
Yes, then?

596
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:52,059
You tell Jeroen, tomorrow...

597
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:58,429
You... soldier, Canada

598
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:03,067
Friend

599
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:09,070
Thanks

600
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:10,508
Yes

601
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:18,780
God bless
Yes

602
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:32,966
Beautiful, isn't it?

603
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:34,898
Gorgeous

604
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:36,402
yes
You know what he said then?

605
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:38,802
I love you

606
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:40,431
I love you

607
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:44,068
And then he came very close
but I told him, No

608
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:46,103
What are you laughing at?

609
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:47,681
What's that?

610
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,307
Gertie's going out
with a soldier

611
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:53,187
This is a farewell present

612
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,290
Mind your own business, Elly

613
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,517
Little girls have big ears

614
01:14:57,659 --> 01:14:59,627
Farewell present?

615
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:02,389
Get out of the way

616
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:04,294
Are you ok?

617
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:06,333
Are you hurt?

618
01:16:55,777 --> 01:17:00,441
Walt...

619
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:27,636
My photo

620
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:29,334
What have you done with it?

621
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:32,675
Bloody boy
you're a bike-thief

622
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:34,281
And now it's broken too

623
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:41,198
then Moses stretched his hand
over the sea

624
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:46,940
the waves parted
And Israelites were able to cross

625
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:50,540
but when Pharaoh's army
followed

626
01:19:50,685 --> 01:20:01,584
the waves came together again
and drowned them

627
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:17,207
Wake up, Jeroen

628
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:19,506
A letter from your mother

629
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:22,811
Maybe she'll come
and visit you

630
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:24,441
There you are

631
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:35,824
Read it out, boy
we're so curious to know

632
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:17,131
Jeroen darling

633
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:20,400
how big you are
You look so well

634
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:21,736
I missed you so

635
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,401
I'll never let you go again

636
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:27,311
You should know
I'm off to America

637
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:32,950
Can I open it, Mrs.?

638
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:35,682
It's for you

639
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:37,416
It's almost 300 years old

640
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:42,997
folks, look here
Nice, isn't it?

641
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:45,599
What a nice watch

642
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:48,362
Your tea, madam

643
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:51,734
He has grown a lot, hasn't he?

644
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:53,306
We're very grateful to you

645
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:59,380
It's nothing
It was just our duty

646
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:07,220
This beautiful present

647
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:11,348
It reconciles us
to the farewell

648
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:19,662
Jeroen has become like
our own child

649
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:27,064
And now we have to hurry
otherwise you'll miss the boat

650
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:31,304
Yes, it's a long journey ahead

651
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,710
I'll pack his things

652
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:35,338
He won't fit into this anymore

653
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:38,452
I know
that's why I put these in

654
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:41,282
He lived in these pants

655
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:45,992
Military thread

656
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:50,928
He learnt them at school
A souvenir

657
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:53,227
Isn't that nice?

658
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:07,139
I found these things here

659
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:11,844
They belonged to
one of the Canadian soldiers

660
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:16,991
Maybe you could take them
for Jeroen

661
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:22,290
For later, we don't use
this kind of thing

662
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:26,829
Amsterdam. Here we go

663
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:28,663
I love you

664
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:47,510
Come on, Jeroen
We have to hurry up

665
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:54,528
Bye

666
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:58,689
Jeroen
will you send us a photo?

667
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:11,597
You were going to ask me
something

668
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:16,301
That photo
I didn't hear Dad ask for that

669
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,378
Yes, I did

670
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:21,175
I heard

671
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:24,285
but I wanted to forget it

672
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:31,184
It was the only photo on the
whole roll that came out

673
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,792
Forget the step...

674
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:41,925
Use your basis of energy
Use your personal energy

675
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:43,731
Think of... let I told you

676
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:47,330
Think the freedom, It's all up

677
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:50,000
Ok, you mark this

678
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,874
Make me happy

679
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:53,412
Alright?

680
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:55,573
Let I see
who's the new generation

681
01:25:55,717 --> 01:25:57,116
Done it

682
01:25:57,752 --> 01:26:00,346
And you both...

683
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:10,354
ok, here we go
you spire great

684
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:13,464
Just rehearsal

685
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:16,434
Alright, you concentrate

686
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:17,503
Here we go

687
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:16,056
The end
