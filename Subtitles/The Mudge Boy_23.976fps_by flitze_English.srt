2
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:56,021
She's not coming today.

3
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,720
Tomorrow, either.

4
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:05,360
Hello, miss Polly-o.

5
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,852
Thank you, Hannah.

6
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,773
Wow, cousin Jessica.

7
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,073
Your first this week.
Mom would have been very proud.

8
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:27,993
Hi, chicken.

9
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:36,413
Hey.

10
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:15,746
- I can clean it up.
- Go in the house.

11
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:17,806
Bring them eggs with you.

12
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:21,967
Miss Blodgett said you
should fix the front step.

13
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,793
How was your day?

14
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:38,907
It was fine.

15
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:48,394
How's your supper?

16
00:06:51,673 --> 00:06:52,673
It's good.

17
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:22,221
"How was your day, Duncan?"

18
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:24,821
Good.

19
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:27,987
"Did you tell your father
about old red hen?"

20
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,867
"I had to bury another one
of my chickens today, Edgar...

21
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:32,633
old age."

22
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,894
"Duncan played the minister.

23
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,506
- You should've seen him throw the Bible."
- Just don't.

24
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:41,664
"Now, Edgar, death's just as
much a part of life as living is."

25
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:43,717
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

26
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,146
I'm going to have a smoke.

27
00:10:02,174 --> 00:10:03,307
That it?

28
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:04,612
That's all of it.

29
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,193
Look at that.

30
00:10:07,218 --> 00:10:09,351
Follows him like
a little puppy dog.

31
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,860
That chicken belongs
with the others.

32
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:17,747
Nacnud Egdum.

33
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,613
This is my last name backwards.

34
00:10:20,773 --> 00:10:22,463
Duncan Mudge is Nacnud Egdum.

35
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:23,488
You go...

36
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,350
M-U-D-G-E, E-G-D-U-M.

37
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:28,841
Egdum.

38
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:30,646
Egg dumb, huh?

39
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:32,271
Yeah, it's kind of funny.

40
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:34,441
You can do anything.

41
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:37,406
Juster Pelkey is, um...

42
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:39,733
How about taking a couple
of chickens home with you?

43
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:40,926
That'd be great.

44
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,279
Yeah.

45
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:44,440
Go grab him two good ones.

46
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:47,631
They're not yours to give.

47
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:50,901
You mind your manners
and get the man his chickens.

48
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:56,827
Hey.

49
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
You hear me?

50
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,853
- I don't want to cause trouble with you.
- You ain't trouble.

51
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:10,067
Sorry, Juster.

52
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,520
It's ok, Duncan.

53
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:19,874
How come Duncan don't help you?

54
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:22,160
He helps out.

55
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:28,140
Cousin Jessica, you're gonna go
live at Juster's house now.

56
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:31,174
It's ok, it's ok.

57
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:33,873
Marilla the Gorilla
is going with you.

58
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:36,006
I know.

59
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:37,618
I know.

60
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:39,280
I'll miss you too.

61
00:11:40,546 --> 00:11:42,966
Just make sure you lay
lots of eggs for him, ok?

62
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,380
He's nice.

63
00:11:50,446 --> 00:11:53,086
I didn't know women had
heart attacks like that, huh?

64
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:55,566
Heard it knocked
her right off her bike.

65
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,319
- Is that true?
- Yeah, yeah.

66
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:00,866
Oi! Those are big ones, Duncan.

67
00:12:03,743 --> 00:12:05,121
They're good layers.

68
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,461
Them are beauties.

69
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,014
Give them to me.

70
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:11,452
Hey, not like that!
You'll hurt them.

71
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,492
Poor little things.

72
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,593
They'll be good eating.

73
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,533
He's a funny kid, Edgar.

74
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,720
You better get these home.

75
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,340
Hey, girl.

76
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:43,654
What the hell you doing?

77
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:46,654
I was just petting her.

78
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:51,239
She'll suck your dick
if you let her.

79
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,033
Well, I wouldn't let her.

80
00:13:56,747 --> 00:13:58,020
I'm just kidding you, Duncan.

81
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
I know.

82
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:05,234
Hey!

83
00:14:05,456 --> 00:14:07,093
She ain't gonna milk herself.

84
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:08,820
No shit. Really?

85
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,080
I'm just talking to
my friend over here.

86
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,177
You're a god damn
smart ass, ain't you?

87
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,313
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.

88
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:32,120
He's just mad because
he lost his license.

89
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:36,814
Nice chicken.

90
00:14:39,353 --> 00:14:40,479
Do you want to hold her?

91
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:43,279
No.

92
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:45,953
I gotta go in.

93
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:47,733
Come on.

94
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:48,967
Come on!

95
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,867
Do you need any eggs?

96
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:17,408
We're leaving shortly.

97
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:24,740
I'm almost ready.

98
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:34,108
on a hill far away

99
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:38,574
stood an old rugged cross

100
00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:44,601
the emblem of
suffering and shame

101
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:50,534
and I love that old cross

102
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,777
where the dearest and best

103
00:16:55,119 --> 00:17:01,745
for a world of lost
sinners was slain

104
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:09,027
so, I'll cherish the
old rugged cross

105
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:15,034
till the moment,
at last I lay down

106
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:21,492
I will cling to the
old rugged cross

107
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:28,320
and exchange it
some day for a crown

108
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:34,390
Where's my eggs, young man?

109
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:36,760
Oh, I forgot. Um...

110
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,086
I'll bring them by after church.

111
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:41,360
Duncan's it.

112
00:17:42,593 --> 00:17:46,034
I just can't get over it.
He's the spitting image of Lydia.

113
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:47,879
You must see it, Edgar.

114
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,172
Yeah, I see it.

115
00:17:50,197 --> 00:17:52,299
More and more like her
every time I see him.

116
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,256
Good morning. How are you?

117
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,367
Tracey!

118
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:00,081
Tracey!

119
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:01,892
Where's your brother?
We're leaving.

120
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:03,743
Oh, he went off downstairs.

121
00:18:04,107 --> 00:18:05,923
- Oh, I'll go get him.
- Thanks.

122
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:07,516
Come on, let's go.

123
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,400
God, you got beautiful tits.

124
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,720
You're sexy as hell.

125
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,856
- Are you being serious?
- Yeah.

126
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:17,369
Take off your panties.

127
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:20,174
Oh, God, Perry,
you're all sweaty.

128
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:21,272
Fuck!

129
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,915
Oh, my god. Are you kidding me?

130
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,840
Why?

131
00:18:24,412 --> 00:18:25,412
Perry?

132
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:29,152
- Perry.
- What?

133
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:31,953
Your mom's leaving.

134
00:18:34,974 --> 00:18:36,474
Oh, Jesus, Perry.

135
00:18:37,387 --> 00:18:38,560
Hi, Duncan.

136
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:39,615
Hi.

137
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,993
Where are you going?

138
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:45,041
Yeah...

139
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,341
your mom is leaving.

140
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:49,320
Tell her I'll be right there.

141
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:50,846
I've got to shit.

142
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:54,807
Ok.

143
00:18:57,913 --> 00:18:59,347
Hop in, Scotty.

144
00:18:59,794 --> 00:19:00,840
Come on, boys.

145
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:07,401
He'll be right out.

146
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:10,260
He was just down there, um...
by himself.

147
00:19:10,285 --> 00:19:11,333
Thanks, Duncan.

148
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,691
Bye, Duncan.

149
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,160
Edgar...

150
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,646
glad you're here.

151
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:34,671
Morning, Reverend.

152
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:37,618
How are you boys making out?

153
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,093
Uh, we're fine, Reverend.
We're doing just fine.

154
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,380
Good.

155
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:24,747
What'd I tell you
about that chicken?

156
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,167
Hey, chicken boy!

157
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,786
- Look, it's the egg lady.
- You're just an asshole, Travis.

158
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:15,786
- "I'll have a dozen."
- "You're an asshole, Travis."

159
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:17,312
We need more beer.

160
00:22:21,193 --> 00:22:22,353
Right, Travis, 'fess up.

161
00:22:22,378 --> 00:22:24,575
I told you, I'm broke
till Monday, man.

162
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,753
What, are you kidding me?

163
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,217
Scotty, you never
have any money.

164
00:22:27,242 --> 00:22:28,957
When's the last time
you bought the beer?

165
00:22:28,982 --> 00:22:30,264
Hmm, let me see.

166
00:22:30,464 --> 00:22:31,364
Never?

167
00:22:32,116 --> 00:22:33,116
Fuck! Hey!

168
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,094
- Take it easy on my wheels, big fella.
- I'm trying.

169
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:38,785
What do you want me to do?
Turn him upside down and shake him?

170
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:40,565
I got money.

171
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:46,053
How much?

172
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,900
That'll do.

173
00:22:56,314 --> 00:22:58,780
- I want some gum.
- Get some chips. I'm starving.

174
00:22:58,805 --> 00:23:00,358
Nice turd, Duncan.

175
00:23:00,383 --> 00:23:02,298
Hey, Travis, check out his turd!

176
00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:04,551
Oh, that's a nice one, pumpkin.

177
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,437
Duncan, bring your
chicken over here.

178
00:23:16,321 --> 00:23:18,575
Oh, my God. She is so cute.

179
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,833
Can I hold her?

180
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:21,967
Sure.

181
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:26,032
Hey, who cuts your hair, Duncan?

182
00:23:26,057 --> 00:23:27,766
Your grandma?

183
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:29,539
No.

184
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,033
My dad.

185
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:33,237
Right, ok.

186
00:23:37,724 --> 00:23:39,724
Ok.

187
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:42,180
Aww, she's sweet.

188
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:43,947
What's her name?

189
00:23:44,794 --> 00:23:45,794
Chicken.

190
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:50,206
Me and my mom

191
00:23:50,273 --> 00:23:54,072
ordered a box of baby chicks in the
mail, and they were all supposed to be...

192
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:56,898
Rhode Island Reds and girls, but

193
00:23:56,954 --> 00:23:59,184
one of them turned
out to be a rooster,

194
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:00,899
and one of them
turned out to be white.

195
00:24:00,924 --> 00:24:01,824
Hmm.

196
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,919
She was my mom's favorite.

197
00:24:04,914 --> 00:24:06,893
Your mom was so pretty.

198
00:24:09,353 --> 00:24:10,353
Yeah.

199
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,320
Gross, Tonya.

200
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,747
Shut up, April.

201
00:24:20,101 --> 00:24:22,127
Uh, chickens are filthy.

202
00:24:22,152 --> 00:24:23,547
God, you're such a girl.

203
00:24:23,572 --> 00:24:25,134
They have diseases.

204
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:27,808
It's kind of skeevy.

205
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:31,021
Eww...

206
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:32,506
Put the tailgate up.

207
00:24:32,566 --> 00:24:34,119
Later, chicken boy.

208
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,132
You should come with us.

209
00:24:47,281 --> 00:24:48,181
Ok.

210
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,787
Hold on. Duncan's
coming with us.

211
00:24:50,812 --> 00:24:51,812
No way.

212
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:54,340
Fuck you, Travis.
He bought the beer.

213
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,399
- Brent...
- Help him with his bike.

214
00:24:56,986 --> 00:24:58,246
Jesus Christ.

215
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,500
Give me the fucking bike.

216
00:25:05,094 --> 00:25:06,094
Come on.

217
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,700
Let's go!

218
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,784
What the fuck is that about?

219
00:27:12,026 --> 00:27:13,179
Whoo!

220
00:27:14,814 --> 00:27:16,437
Go, go, go, go, go!

221
00:27:16,462 --> 00:27:18,029
Yeah!

222
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:29,912
Ugh!

223
00:27:30,502 --> 00:27:31,892
Stop it!

224
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:36,035
Hey, lay off the beer!

225
00:27:43,607 --> 00:27:45,013
Scotty, you need a beer?

226
00:27:48,221 --> 00:27:49,753
- You bought it.
- Whoo!

227
00:27:49,986 --> 00:27:51,439
- Drink it up, brother.
- Yeah!

228
00:28:05,234 --> 00:28:06,360
Hey, Duncan?

229
00:28:06,754 --> 00:28:08,027
How's the beer?

230
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:10,727
Good.

231
00:28:10,872 --> 00:28:13,300
Hey, that hat is
fucking cool, man.

232
00:28:16,054 --> 00:28:17,434
It was my mom's.

233
00:28:18,526 --> 00:28:19,793
Fuckin' geek.

234
00:28:19,857 --> 00:28:21,138
Look at him, look.

235
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,699
Chicken boy!

236
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:26,311
Oof... fuck.

237
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,620
Spell joke.

238
00:29:34,645 --> 00:29:36,260
J-O-K-E.

239
00:29:36,285 --> 00:29:37,393
Spell smoke.

240
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:39,571
S-M-O-K-E.

241
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,537
What do you call the
white part of an egg?

242
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:42,561
Weirdo.

243
00:29:42,586 --> 00:29:43,586
The yolk.

244
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,827
Nope... albumen.

245
00:29:45,991 --> 00:29:47,475
The white part!

246
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:51,006
The white part... right.

247
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:54,059
Come on.

248
00:30:03,392 --> 00:30:05,672
Yes I do, I smell cowshit,
how about you?

249
00:30:05,697 --> 00:30:09,377
I smell cowplop, yes I do.
I smell cowplop, how about you?

250
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:13,393
I smell cowshit, yes I do.
I smell cowshit, how about you?

251
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,220
Scotty, let me sit up front.

252
00:30:15,245 --> 00:30:17,047
My hair's getting all
tangled in my face.

253
00:30:17,072 --> 00:30:20,514
I smell cowplop, yes I do.
I smell cowplop, how about you?

254
00:30:23,274 --> 00:30:24,367
Gimme that hat.

255
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,020
Gimme it.

256
00:30:34,353 --> 00:30:35,475
Put this on.

257
00:30:38,054 --> 00:30:39,209
There you go.

258
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,514
- That better?
- Pff, get off me.

259
00:30:43,732 --> 00:30:45,232
What's the matter with you?

260
00:30:46,573 --> 00:30:48,006
You're a fuckin' bitch.

261
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,172
Oh, my god!

262
00:30:51,861 --> 00:30:53,047
It's Perry!

263
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:55,099
Perry smells like cowshit.

264
00:30:55,124 --> 00:30:57,213
You do smell like cowshit, man.

265
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:01,433
Ow!

266
00:31:05,593 --> 00:31:06,593
Ass!

267
00:31:07,014 --> 00:31:09,021
- Can we go get it?
- Brent!

268
00:31:09,807 --> 00:31:11,744
Let me out. I'm going home.

269
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:15,184
What's the matter, Perry?
Your vagina sore?

270
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:17,997
I'm serious. Let me out of
the fucking car. I'm leaving.

271
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:19,281
Alright.

272
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,564
Take it easy.

273
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:24,640
I want to go get it.

274
00:31:28,894 --> 00:31:31,587
Hey, Scotty, is there
any more beer up there?

275
00:31:37,757 --> 00:31:39,018
Whoo!

276
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:09,907
That's why they make
fun of you, you know?

277
00:33:11,046 --> 00:33:12,373
That and the chicken.

278
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:15,966
I want to go find it.

279
00:33:16,252 --> 00:33:18,026
Forget it.
It's gone.

280
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:23,260
How come you have to act
like that in front of people?

281
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:28,733
I don't know.

282
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:32,560
My mom died.

283
00:33:38,354 --> 00:33:39,493
Yeah, I know.

284
00:33:55,174 --> 00:33:56,418
It's big, huh?

285
00:33:59,673 --> 00:34:00,573
Yeah.

286
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,013
A lot of girls won't let me fuck them
when they first see the size of it.

287
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,100
You have to get them nice
and wet so you don't hurt them.

288
00:34:11,754 --> 00:34:12,654
Yeah.

289
00:34:13,294 --> 00:34:14,194
Yeah.

290
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,573
You ever fuck a girl, Duncan?

291
00:34:20,013 --> 00:34:21,013
No.

292
00:34:22,873 --> 00:34:24,526
I did it with this girl once.

293
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,614
She wouldn't let
me put it in her.

294
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,174
So I just kept
rubbing down there,

295
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,470
playing with her nipples.

296
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:35,227
She had these
big nipples, man.

297
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,270
Stuck out like that.

298
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:39,170
Big, hard ones.

299
00:34:39,335 --> 00:34:40,881
Big cow nipples.

300
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,581
I rub one between my fingers...

301
00:34:48,058 --> 00:34:49,850
and whisper "let me fuck you."

302
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:51,700
"No, I can't."

303
00:34:52,241 --> 00:34:54,167
So, I'd pinch them real
hard when she said that.

304
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:56,161
Hard, so she'd moan.

305
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,946
Just to punish her a little.

306
00:34:58,177 --> 00:35:01,256
But you could tell she was loving it,
because her pussy was sopping wet.

307
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:04,307
And I just kept licking
on those nipples.

308
00:35:04,513 --> 00:35:05,907
Flicking my tongue on them.

309
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:07,099
Pulling 'em.

310
00:35:07,246 --> 00:35:08,739
Just teasing the
hell out of her.

311
00:35:12,573 --> 00:35:14,739
She started grabbing
on that big dick.

312
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,587
I was sliding two fingers
in and out of her.

313
00:35:17,787 --> 00:35:19,286
"Let me fuck you."

314
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,786
But she didn't say nothing.

315
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:23,333
Just kept moaning
and moving her ass.

316
00:35:24,267 --> 00:35:25,713
So I slide in another finger.

317
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,509
"Fuck me! Fuck me!"

318
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,321
She said it that time.

319
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:34,620
"Fuck me, Perry."

320
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:43,380
I like to look them
right in the eyes

321
00:35:43,405 --> 00:35:45,645
the first time they feel
that dick going up in there.

322
00:35:48,434 --> 00:35:50,650
Pretty soon, I could
feel her underneath me...

323
00:35:51,473 --> 00:35:53,526
sliding her ass
down on that big dick.

324
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:58,447
It's funny.

325
00:35:59,345 --> 00:36:01,071
First, they don't
let you fuck them...

326
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,940
and then they're fucking
themselves on your own cock.

327
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,220
Yeah.

328
00:36:08,086 --> 00:36:10,159
People do weird stuff sometimes.

329
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,480
Fuck!

330
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,067
- Perry!
- My dad.

331
00:36:17,632 --> 00:36:19,306
I better go before he comes out.

332
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Perry!

333
00:36:24,628 --> 00:36:25,628
Bye, Perry.

334
00:37:16,594 --> 00:37:17,707
Where you been?

335
00:37:19,267 --> 00:37:20,267
I was out...

336
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:22,473
riding around with my friends.

337
00:37:29,273 --> 00:37:31,807
I've been thinking
that I want you to...

338
00:37:32,247 --> 00:37:34,047
to help me out more around here.

339
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:37,967
There's no reason to pay Juster

340
00:37:37,992 --> 00:37:40,185
when I got a good,
strong boy like you.

341
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:53,000
How you feeling?

342
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,267
You had supper?

343
00:37:54,847 --> 00:37:55,847
I'm fine.

344
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:02,514
Alright.

345
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:04,047
Well...

346
00:38:04,887 --> 00:38:07,193
we gotta bale the rest
of that first cut tomorrow.

347
00:38:09,405 --> 00:38:10,732
Yes, sir.

348
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:15,821
Uh...

349
00:38:18,334 --> 00:38:20,594
I think your mother would
want you to have this.

350
00:38:32,966 --> 00:38:33,966
Thank you.

351
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:03,367
No more, alright?

352
00:39:12,741 --> 00:39:14,121
We gotta get up at 5:00.

353
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,640
Dad...

354
00:39:19,847 --> 00:39:21,780
you're not throwing
it out, are you?

355
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:25,761
I'm just putting some
things in storage.

356
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:42,827
We gotta get an
early start tomorrow.

357
00:40:44,581 --> 00:40:46,747
We gotta get all this in
the barn before it rains.

358
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:53,474
Hey.

359
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:55,659
No, thank you.

360
00:41:02,067 --> 00:41:03,600
Why don't you go get cleaned up?

361
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,941
You can go see
those friends of yours.

362
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:09,814
What about dinner?

363
00:41:10,754 --> 00:41:11,807
I'll fix my own.

364
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:28,441
Hey, Perry.

365
00:41:29,434 --> 00:41:30,434
What's up?

366
00:41:33,466 --> 00:41:35,086
They're cute, aren't they?

367
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:41,101
Want some help?

368
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:42,126
I got it.

369
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:44,960
Why aren't you helping your dad?

370
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,620
What'd you do to your lip?

371
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:49,986
Nothing.

372
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,760
It's fucked up, you know?

373
00:42:00,046 --> 00:42:01,413
You have this idea that...

374
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:04,579
your life will automatically
be different when you grow up.

375
00:42:05,207 --> 00:42:08,534
Then you start getting older and you
realize it's all gonna be the same shit.

376
00:42:10,253 --> 00:42:11,413
You know what I mean?

377
00:42:12,153 --> 00:42:13,153
Sort of.

378
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:15,774
It's a fucking joke.

379
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,140
Yeah.

380
00:42:18,947 --> 00:42:20,213
I know what you mean.

381
00:42:24,725 --> 00:42:26,226
That chicken know any tricks?

382
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:27,566
No.

383
00:42:28,453 --> 00:42:29,740
Then you should teach her some.

384
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,660
Like what?

385
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,140
I don't know.

386
00:42:33,527 --> 00:42:34,848
Roll over, sit...

387
00:42:35,414 --> 00:42:36,414
it's your chicken.

388
00:42:51,707 --> 00:42:52,801
Give me your bike.

389
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:44,026
Take your clothes off.

390
00:43:47,648 --> 00:43:48,781
Aren't you going in?

391
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,707
I'm waiting till I'm more sweaty.

392
00:43:51,941 --> 00:43:53,013
I'm going in.

393
00:43:58,027 --> 00:43:59,027
That's far.

394
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,207
Is it deep?

395
00:44:00,653 --> 00:44:01,653
Deep enough.

396
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:04,097
Hey, help!

397
00:44:06,747 --> 00:44:08,295
Are you crazy?

398
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,940
You almost killed me!

399
00:44:09,965 --> 00:44:11,811
You're ok. You can swim, right?

400
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:13,359
Yeah.

401
00:44:13,867 --> 00:44:15,533
Duncan!

402
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,118
Oh, it's fucking cold!

403
00:44:24,307 --> 00:44:25,307
It's freezing.

404
00:44:26,321 --> 00:44:27,734
That was kind of fun.

405
00:44:29,153 --> 00:44:30,753
That wasn't so bad, was it?

406
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:37,633
Whoo!

407
00:44:41,973 --> 00:44:42,973
It's neat.

408
00:44:44,331 --> 00:44:45,624
This is my hideout.

409
00:44:46,198 --> 00:44:47,198
Really?

410
00:44:48,447 --> 00:44:49,347
Wow.

411
00:44:51,294 --> 00:44:52,587
Nobody but me.

412
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,341
Did you ever bring
a girl up here?

413
00:44:59,027 --> 00:45:00,987
- Fuck, no.
- Duncan?

414
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:03,592
Duncan!

415
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,232
He's gotta be here.
His bike's here.

416
00:45:06,257 --> 00:45:07,817
Duncan, buddy?

417
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:09,861
Where are you?

418
00:45:09,886 --> 00:45:11,059
Duncan?

419
00:45:11,606 --> 00:45:13,552
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

420
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:15,330
- Fudge boy!
- Dude, dude, dude, dude,

421
00:45:15,355 --> 00:45:16,377
put it on the tracks.

422
00:45:16,402 --> 00:45:18,262
Wait, wait, no, wait.
I got a better idea.

423
00:45:18,287 --> 00:45:19,622
Throw it in. Throw it in.

424
00:45:21,767 --> 00:45:22,893
- Oh, shit!
- My bike!

425
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:23,918
I'll get it.

426
00:45:24,334 --> 00:45:26,154
Oops, sorry, man.

427
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,813
Dinky, where are you?

428
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:30,030
Dude, he's gotta be down there.

429
00:45:30,054 --> 00:45:30,954
Fuck!

430
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:31,979
Oh, shit!

431
00:45:32,347 --> 00:45:34,087
Scotty, you're supposed
to watch out for trains.

432
00:45:34,112 --> 00:45:35,238
Fuck, man, I didn't hear it.

433
00:45:35,263 --> 00:45:36,738
Run, you stupid fucks!

434
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,407
It's like a rock, huh?

435
00:46:22,827 --> 00:46:23,727
Yeah.

436
00:46:27,647 --> 00:46:29,231
I'd better get your bike.

437
00:46:39,933 --> 00:46:42,780
Me and my mom made a little cemetery
for them when they get old.

438
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:46,240
She won't let my dad eat 'em.

439
00:46:46,784 --> 00:46:48,070
She doesn't believe in it.

440
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:51,267
And he listens to her?

441
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,340
He used to.

442
00:46:59,573 --> 00:47:01,333
You guys gave
them a lot of names.

443
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,600
Yeah.

444
00:47:10,907 --> 00:47:12,707
I never knew anyone
that died before.

445
00:47:16,207 --> 00:47:17,893
Are your grandparents
still alive?

446
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:20,399
My mom's are.

447
00:47:21,507 --> 00:47:22,821
I never met my dad's.

448
00:47:24,713 --> 00:47:25,713
Probably dead.

449
00:47:30,127 --> 00:47:31,354
I always thought...

450
00:47:32,354 --> 00:47:33,834
if you're a good person...

451
00:47:35,073 --> 00:47:37,625
when you died,
you'd just go straight to heaven.

452
00:47:38,793 --> 00:47:40,320
Like a reward or something.

453
00:47:41,707 --> 00:47:44,485
But then they just...
put you in the ground...

454
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:46,800
and bugs and worms eat you.

455
00:47:50,426 --> 00:47:51,800
There's definitely a heaven.

456
00:47:54,867 --> 00:47:56,000
There has to be.

457
00:48:10,368 --> 00:48:11,468
Were they in love?

458
00:48:13,306 --> 00:48:14,206
Who?

459
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:15,330
Your parents.

460
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:22,913
I guess so.

461
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:30,313
Want to know a secret?

462
00:48:31,346 --> 00:48:32,246
Yeah.

463
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:36,327
Never mind.

464
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,940
Tell me.

465
00:48:38,813 --> 00:48:40,200
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

466
00:48:55,794 --> 00:48:57,247
You can calm a chicken...

467
00:48:57,587 --> 00:48:59,354
by putting its
head in your mouth.

468
00:49:00,827 --> 00:49:02,233
My mom showed me.

469
00:49:10,074 --> 00:49:11,893
Your mom was a weirdo, too, huh?

470
00:49:18,301 --> 00:49:19,201
No.

471
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:25,601
I didn't mean that.

472
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,714
You think I'm weird?

473
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,380
Yeah.

474
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,220
A little. Don't you?

475
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,360
I don't know.

476
00:49:52,094 --> 00:49:53,141
Wanna try it?

477
00:49:54,628 --> 00:49:56,501
See, that's what I'm
talking about, Duncan.

478
00:49:57,539 --> 00:49:58,539
That's weird.

479
00:50:51,534 --> 00:50:52,534
Duncan!

480
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,860
Coming.

481
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:26,047
- Is that it?
- That's it.

482
00:51:35,388 --> 00:51:36,767
Today was kind of fun.

483
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,227
Hey, Mr. Mudge. Hey, Duncan.

484
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,087
Hey, Duncan,
you wanna do something?

485
00:52:09,147 --> 00:52:10,501
We're just cruising around.

486
00:52:10,554 --> 00:52:11,807
Come with us, Duncan.

487
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:15,214
Where's Perry?

488
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:16,581
We're going to pick him up.

489
00:52:19,093 --> 00:52:20,093
Can I?

490
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:22,266
Yeah. Go ahead.

491
00:52:25,673 --> 00:52:26,940
Let me get ready.

492
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,080
How you been, Mr. Mudge?

493
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:37,406
Just fine.

494
00:52:39,134 --> 00:52:40,134
It's good.

495
00:52:40,606 --> 00:52:41,606
Good to hear.

496
00:53:00,614 --> 00:53:01,614
Duncan!

497
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:03,953
- Bye, dad.
- Ok.

498
00:53:03,978 --> 00:53:05,712
Hey, you got money, right?

499
00:53:09,315 --> 00:53:10,581
- Hold on a minute.
- Shit.

500
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,893
Buy something for
your friends there.

501
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:24,080
Wow!

502
00:53:24,393 --> 00:53:26,546
- Thank you.
- Scotty, get the fuck out.

503
00:53:27,027 --> 00:53:27,927
Please.

504
00:53:27,952 --> 00:53:28,952
Yeah, right.

505
00:53:34,973 --> 00:53:36,160
Hop in, buddy.

506
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,162
Hey, Duncan,
where's your chicken?

507
00:53:38,187 --> 00:53:40,022
- I don't know.
- Bummer.

508
00:53:40,047 --> 00:53:41,890
She's probably around somewhere.

509
00:53:43,013 --> 00:53:44,013
Bye, dad.

510
00:53:44,427 --> 00:53:45,427
Careful, now.

511
00:54:30,174 --> 00:54:31,592
Take a pull, Duncan.

512
00:54:34,247 --> 00:54:36,368
Drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink...

513
00:54:36,434 --> 00:54:39,201
drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink...

514
00:54:44,171 --> 00:54:45,179
Pumpkin!

515
00:54:45,203 --> 00:54:46,203
Pumpkin!

516
00:54:48,593 --> 00:54:49,793
Dandelion wine.

517
00:54:54,018 --> 00:54:55,766
- How you feel, buddy?
- How are you feeling?

518
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:57,493
How you feeling, Duncan?

519
00:54:58,074 --> 00:54:59,538
- Tingly.
- Tingly!

520
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,745
Tingly, huh?

521
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:06,368
Hey! Hey, Duncan.

522
00:55:06,527 --> 00:55:07,787
Do it again, man.

523
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,500
Yeah, do it. Come on.

524
00:55:09,525 --> 00:55:10,771
I shouldn't have done it.

525
00:55:11,531 --> 00:55:13,157
- Come on, do it.
- Do it again.

526
00:55:13,828 --> 00:55:15,394
- Do it.
- Do it.

527
00:55:18,906 --> 00:55:19,986
Come on, do it.

528
00:55:20,011 --> 00:55:21,257
Come on, man, do it.

529
00:55:24,561 --> 00:55:27,093
Took an awful spill
off my bike today.

530
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,221
I need you to fix
those tires, Edgar.

531
00:55:30,246 --> 00:55:31,699
They're awful wobbly.

532
00:55:31,723 --> 00:55:32,623
Shit.

533
00:55:41,731 --> 00:55:42,631
Hey!

534
00:55:45,527 --> 00:55:46,689
Who is that guy?

535
00:55:47,321 --> 00:55:48,382
Leave him alone.

536
00:55:48,434 --> 00:55:49,572
He's a freak.

537
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,807
Freak!

538
00:55:51,127 --> 00:55:52,200
Freak!

539
00:55:52,946 --> 00:55:53,946
Hold on...

540
00:55:54,772 --> 00:55:55,772
to Duncan.

541
00:55:56,111 --> 00:55:57,143
To Drunken!

542
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,433
- Drunken Mudge!
- Drunken Mudge!

543
00:55:59,544 --> 00:56:01,193
To the chicken boy!

544
00:56:01,311 --> 00:56:02,642
Chicken boy!

545
00:56:02,785 --> 00:56:04,825
- Chicken boy!
- Chicken boy!

546
00:56:05,204 --> 00:56:06,012
Hey!

547
00:56:06,037 --> 00:56:07,434
- Drunken boy!
- Drunken boy!

548
00:56:07,459 --> 00:56:08,551
To the chicken boy!

549
00:56:08,576 --> 00:56:10,336
Chicken boy!

550
00:56:10,462 --> 00:56:11,462
Chicken boy!

551
00:56:13,547 --> 00:56:14,754
Moo!

552
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:15,719
Fuck off!

553
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,534
Ahh! Oh, Jesus.

554
00:56:17,559 --> 00:56:18,559
Perry, stop it!

555
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:19,526
Shit!

556
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,097
Get him, Perry!

557
00:56:21,821 --> 00:56:23,154
Perry, that's enough!

558
00:56:25,593 --> 00:56:26,617
Hurry, do something!

559
00:56:26,642 --> 00:56:28,477
- Perry, that's enough!
- Perry, no!

560
00:56:29,768 --> 00:56:32,028
Don't talk like that to a lady,
you fucking faggot!

561
00:56:32,053 --> 00:56:33,053
Perry!

562
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:35,980
Perry!

563
00:56:36,005 --> 00:56:38,125
You fucking kicked his ass.

564
00:56:39,379 --> 00:56:41,435
Perry, you beat
the shit out of him.

565
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:42,780
Motherfucker!

566
00:56:42,805 --> 00:56:45,219
Teach that boy some manners.
You see that, Scotty?

567
00:56:45,244 --> 00:56:46,601
Fuck, yeah, I saw it.

568
00:56:46,626 --> 00:56:48,281
You're insane, Peraldo.

569
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,400
I'm cold.

570
00:57:01,813 --> 00:57:02,781
Help!

571
00:57:02,806 --> 00:57:04,419
Brent, take me home.

572
00:57:05,272 --> 00:57:07,605
It's time to hook up
or pass out.

573
00:57:08,693 --> 00:57:10,574
Guess which one you're doing.

574
00:57:14,747 --> 00:57:16,027
Come on, Brent.

575
00:57:16,052 --> 00:57:17,625
I'm getting all bitten up.

576
00:57:19,873 --> 00:57:22,047
You're gonna have
to wait till I sober up.

577
00:57:23,014 --> 00:57:25,454
I already fucked up
one truck like that.

578
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:27,152
Are you kidding me?

579
00:57:28,379 --> 00:57:31,386
Perry, make him take me home.
I'm freezing.

580
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:33,847
Perry, I'm talking to you!

581
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,473
Come here, baby.

582
00:57:38,281 --> 00:57:39,486
I'll warm you up.

583
00:57:42,746 --> 00:57:43,746
Get over here.

584
00:58:00,347 --> 00:58:01,347
April!

585
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,321
Get off of me!

586
00:58:35,126 --> 00:58:36,126
You like that?

587
00:59:10,627 --> 00:59:12,494
What's the matter with you?
You're taking forever.

588
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:13,419
Nothing.

589
00:59:13,612 --> 00:59:14,612
Keep doing it.

590
00:59:15,727 --> 00:59:16,627
April?

591
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:18,544
Let's go.
We're leaving.

592
00:59:18,569 --> 00:59:19,624
I gotta go.

593
00:59:19,744 --> 00:59:20,744
Let's go!

594
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:22,981
- You're kidding me.
- No. Sorry. I gotta go.

595
00:59:23,006 --> 00:59:24,677
April, come on. I got us a ride.

596
00:59:24,702 --> 00:59:26,115
You're a fucking bitch.

597
00:59:26,368 --> 00:59:27,368
Fuck you!

598
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:34,501
Pervert.

599
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:37,179
Fucking tease!

600
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:43,967
You're in the shithouse
with me, man.

601
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,440
No, I know. I'm sorry, Perry.

602
00:59:48,571 --> 00:59:50,272
I didn't, I didn't mean to.

603
00:59:50,813 --> 00:59:51,813
Forget it.

604
00:59:52,914 --> 00:59:54,787
I'm, I'm sorry, Perry.

605
00:59:58,573 --> 01:00:00,440
I know something we could do.

606
01:00:02,053 --> 01:00:03,993
- Hurry the fuck...
- Dude, Duncan was watching.

607
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:05,438
Shut up. I'm tired.

608
01:00:06,008 --> 01:00:08,111
- They're gonna fucking leave.
- Ok, ok.

609
01:00:20,133 --> 01:00:22,081
My dad put all
her stuff out here.

610
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:23,960
Why?

611
01:00:25,707 --> 01:00:27,554
He wants to forget her, I guess.

612
01:00:29,886 --> 01:00:31,587
She sure had a lot of shit.

613
01:00:32,252 --> 01:00:33,152
Yeah.

614
01:00:41,086 --> 01:00:42,520
Hey, thanks, Perry.

615
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:45,780
For what?

616
01:00:53,414 --> 01:00:54,621
Being nice.

617
01:00:59,393 --> 01:01:00,613
My knuckle is bleeding.

618
01:01:01,681 --> 01:01:02,948
You see me hit that guy?

619
01:01:03,924 --> 01:01:05,118
The fucker cut me.

620
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,900
Here.

621
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:12,320
Fix your hairdo.

622
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:17,867
Pew! Oh, it stinks.

623
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,040
My mom could play that.

624
01:01:22,399 --> 01:01:24,698
- Yee-haw!
- Shh! My dad.

625
01:01:25,546 --> 01:01:26,446
Oops.

626
01:01:32,945 --> 01:01:34,237
Check this out.

627
01:01:49,099 --> 01:01:50,179
Try it on.

628
01:01:53,934 --> 01:01:55,174
What else is there?

629
01:01:56,326 --> 01:01:57,454
Come on. It's funny.

630
01:01:59,467 --> 01:02:01,446
Uh, I'm not supposed to.

631
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,353
Just try it on.

632
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:14,521
Alright. Let's get out of here if
you don't want to have any fun.

633
01:02:14,546 --> 01:02:16,014
But you don't think it's weird?

634
01:02:16,479 --> 01:02:17,479
Uh-uh.

635
01:02:18,587 --> 01:02:20,099
It's just the two of us.
Who cares?

636
01:02:25,727 --> 01:02:27,034
You really want me to?

637
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:30,127
I don't want you to.
I just thought it'd be funny.

638
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:32,080
Like Halloween or something.

639
01:02:35,254 --> 01:02:37,254
Me and my mom used
to go trick-or-treating.

640
01:02:41,907 --> 01:02:44,554
This old lady, miss McGee,
who lived up the road from us...

641
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:45,754
Not over your clothes.

642
01:02:46,854 --> 01:02:47,960
It won't look right.

643
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,654
And, uh, ha...

644
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:57,067
well...

645
01:02:57,267 --> 01:02:58,267
everyone...

646
01:02:59,044 --> 01:03:01,190
used to think she
was a witch, 'cause...

647
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:04,476
her house,
it did look kind of haunted.

648
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:08,114
But, um, so, one
year we go up there...

649
01:03:08,834 --> 01:03:10,731
and we go on her porch...

650
01:03:11,171 --> 01:03:12,691
and she just comes...

651
01:03:13,137 --> 01:03:16,118
running out of there,
waving her broomstick at us...

652
01:03:16,303 --> 01:03:17,997
and yelling and saying that...

653
01:03:18,287 --> 01:03:19,860
if we didn't get out...

654
01:03:20,647 --> 01:03:22,301
she'd call the constable.

655
01:03:22,973 --> 01:03:23,973
Turn around.

656
01:03:26,294 --> 01:03:27,294
Looks good.

657
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:29,320
- Yeah.
- Mm...

658
01:03:30,293 --> 01:03:31,513
don't take it off.

659
01:03:33,234 --> 01:03:34,513
You gotta do the back up.

660
01:03:37,673 --> 01:03:41,093
It was weird, 'cause
she really did look like a witch, but...

661
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,993
we just felt kind of
bad for her, though.

662
01:03:44,865 --> 01:03:46,598
Even though she
didn't give us any candy.

663
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,645
I remember that old lady.

664
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,686
She was a fucking bitch.

665
01:03:52,253 --> 01:03:53,939
You sure swear a lot, Perry.

666
01:03:56,346 --> 01:03:57,346
What? Bitch?

667
01:03:58,567 --> 01:03:59,467
Perry.

668
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,667
- Are you a bitch?
- No.

669
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:04,699
- Quit it!
- Bitch.

670
01:04:06,201 --> 01:04:08,227
- Huh?
- Quit it, Perry.

671
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,153
Huh? What?

672
01:04:10,865 --> 01:04:11,865
Say it.

673
01:04:12,551 --> 01:04:13,551
Say it!

674
01:04:14,287 --> 01:04:15,427
I'm a bitch.

675
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,100
Take it out.

676
01:04:23,645 --> 01:04:24,645
Take it out!

677
01:04:27,979 --> 01:04:28,979
Go on.

678
01:04:36,926 --> 01:04:38,153
Tastes like pee.

679
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:39,339
Keep doing it.

680
01:04:43,847 --> 01:04:44,747
Ow!

681
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:47,040
Fuck, that hurt.

682
01:04:47,806 --> 01:04:48,528
Perry.

683
01:04:48,553 --> 01:04:50,846
- What the fuck is the matter with you?
- I'm sorry.

684
01:04:50,871 --> 01:04:53,522
Would you stop fucking
saying that? Alright?

685
01:04:53,547 --> 01:04:55,497
- I'm not mad at you.
- What are you doing?

686
01:04:55,522 --> 01:04:57,632
What are you doing?
Perry, what are you doing?

687
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:58,686
Shh.

688
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:00,740
Perry?

689
01:05:01,146 --> 01:05:02,146
Hold still.

690
01:05:03,611 --> 01:05:04,865
I'm not gonna hurt you.

691
01:05:05,228 --> 01:05:06,718
- Alright?
- Perry.

692
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:08,553
Spread your legs.

693
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:09,960
Further.

694
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:11,307
That's it.

695
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:12,738
Shh.

696
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:14,780
I'm just gonna put it in a little.

697
01:05:14,805 --> 01:05:15,705
Perry.

698
01:05:16,552 --> 01:05:17,452
Ah!

699
01:05:18,226 --> 01:05:19,726
That's not so bad, right?

700
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,240
You ok?

701
01:05:23,282 --> 01:05:24,182
Yeah.

702
01:05:26,834 --> 01:05:28,367
God, you're fucking tight.

703
01:05:33,185 --> 01:05:34,628
It feels just like a pussy.

704
01:06:37,313 --> 01:06:39,473
My dad says we might
be getting a new car.

705
01:06:40,641 --> 01:06:41,756
It's about time.

706
01:06:42,901 --> 01:06:44,147
Have you seen our old one?

707
01:06:46,473 --> 01:06:49,506
My mom can hardly drive it
'cause the steering wheel shakes so bad.

708
01:06:50,933 --> 01:06:52,773
You hear it coming
from a mile away...

709
01:06:53,493 --> 01:06:54,960
'cause the muffler fell off.

710
01:06:57,587 --> 01:06:59,054
It's fucking embarrassing.

711
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,399
Don't tell my dad, ok?

712
01:07:08,906 --> 01:07:10,407
That's why she drives the truck.

713
01:07:15,793 --> 01:07:16,987
Can you undo it?

714
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,680
I was trying to take it off.

715
01:07:35,121 --> 01:07:36,407
I couldn't get it off.

716
01:07:40,746 --> 01:07:42,140
You go on home, Perry.

717
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:48,854
Go in the house.

718
01:07:49,272 --> 01:07:50,740
And take that thing off.

719
01:07:50,913 --> 01:07:52,293
- I can't...
- I said, take it off!

720
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:53,633
I can't undo it.

721
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:13,560
- I'm sorry.
- Don't talk to me.

722
01:09:07,607 --> 01:09:08,607
Get up.

723
01:09:09,373 --> 01:09:10,373
I'm up.

724
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:01,520
Hey!

725
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,007
Wash up before you sit down.

726
01:11:16,707 --> 01:11:17,813
You hear me?

727
01:11:33,466 --> 01:11:34,466
Get up.

728
01:11:38,921 --> 01:11:39,921
Move it.

729
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:46,783
Not so easy, is it?

730
01:11:47,609 --> 01:11:48,509
Hmm?

731
01:11:50,287 --> 01:11:52,254
I do it every goddamn day.

732
01:11:56,787 --> 01:11:57,787
You're weak.

733
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:01,687
How you ever going to
take care of yourself, huh?

734
01:12:03,401 --> 01:12:04,301
Hmm?

735
01:12:08,547 --> 01:12:09,547
Get up.

736
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:16,540
Goddamn it, Duncan, get your
filthy ass off your mother's sofa.

737
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:17,465
Now!

738
01:12:20,853 --> 01:12:23,233
In case you haven't noticed,
she's dead.

739
01:12:45,814 --> 01:12:47,314
What's the matter with you?

740
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:49,480
Huh?

741
01:12:50,553 --> 01:12:52,052
What's the matter with you?

742
01:12:53,766 --> 01:12:56,679
You can't even get into
trouble like a normal boy.

743
01:13:02,434 --> 01:13:03,434
Alright.

744
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:06,000
Goddamn, alright. Alright.

745
01:13:19,134 --> 01:13:20,034
Dad!

746
01:13:20,252 --> 01:13:21,252
You can't!

747
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,507
Dad, you can't.

748
01:13:30,776 --> 01:13:32,524
You can't. You can't.

749
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:35,576
- Go!
- You can't.

750
01:13:36,299 --> 01:13:37,299
Go on!

751
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,240
Put them down.

752
01:13:49,953 --> 01:13:50,953
Do it.

753
01:13:52,247 --> 01:13:53,900
- Please!
- Put it down.

754
01:14:09,513 --> 01:14:10,513
Please, dad.

755
01:14:13,326 --> 01:14:15,540
I should have done
this from the start.

756
01:14:57,574 --> 01:14:58,474
Perry.

757
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:02,760
Perry?

758
01:15:08,247 --> 01:15:09,640
What the fuck are you doing?

759
01:15:09,665 --> 01:15:11,047
I need to talk to you.

760
01:15:11,701 --> 01:15:13,074
Jesus, Duncan.

761
01:15:13,669 --> 01:15:14,854
You smell like shit.

762
01:15:23,933 --> 01:15:25,286
What did your dad say?

763
01:15:25,861 --> 01:15:26,861
Nothing.

764
01:15:27,067 --> 01:15:28,067
Nothing?

765
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,287
He burned all my mom's stuff.

766
01:15:33,847 --> 01:15:35,394
He didn't say anything about me?

767
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:37,920
No.

768
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:40,020
Are you sure?

769
01:15:40,448 --> 01:15:42,333
He's only mad at me, you know.

770
01:15:44,033 --> 01:15:45,947
I didn't tell him what you did.

771
01:15:52,527 --> 01:15:54,133
We can't do nothing no more.

772
01:15:57,046 --> 01:15:58,046
It ain't right.

773
01:16:00,414 --> 01:16:03,367
- I didn't tell him, Perry.
- We can't do nothing no more.

774
01:16:05,747 --> 01:16:06,747
It's queer.

775
01:16:08,641 --> 01:16:09,807
I ain't no queer.

776
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:12,833
I know.

777
01:16:17,047 --> 01:16:18,193
I'm sorry, Perry.

778
01:16:18,218 --> 01:16:19,307
You're always sorry.

779
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:21,490
What are you sorry about?

780
01:16:23,459 --> 01:16:25,826
You act like a goddamn
girl sometimes, Duncan.

781
01:16:27,126 --> 01:16:28,026
Shit.

782
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:40,060
Perry.

783
01:16:40,246 --> 01:16:41,146
What?

784
01:16:44,453 --> 01:16:45,453
Did you ever...

785
01:16:47,919 --> 01:16:49,633
Did you ever think
about kissing me?

786
01:16:52,707 --> 01:16:54,007
You're crazy, Duncan.

787
01:16:56,454 --> 01:16:57,354
No.

788
01:16:59,633 --> 01:17:00,633
No way.

789
01:17:09,504 --> 01:17:11,327
Is that what you want? Huh?

790
01:17:13,694 --> 01:17:14,594
No.

791
01:17:34,701 --> 01:17:36,474
You're a fucking faggot, Duncan.

792
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:40,827
Stay the fuck away from me.

793
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,740
Where the hell you been, Perry?

794
01:18:07,374 --> 01:18:08,566
Just out smoking.

795
01:18:09,626 --> 01:18:11,254
Just out smoking, huh?

796
01:18:13,053 --> 01:18:13,953
Yeah.

797
01:18:15,627 --> 01:18:17,570
What does "lights out"
mean, Perry?

798
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,350
I know I, I know I...

799
01:18:20,152 --> 01:18:21,785
I know I've said it,
but I just...

800
01:18:22,306 --> 01:18:24,932
just can't seem to remember.

801
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,493
Out wandering around time?

802
01:18:30,234 --> 01:18:32,220
Out raising hell time?

803
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,293
Just out smoking time?

804
01:18:37,373 --> 01:18:38,373
Bedtime.

805
01:18:39,902 --> 01:18:40,902
Bedtime.

806
01:18:45,813 --> 01:18:48,045
Yeah, I guess that's it.
Bedtime.

807
01:19:46,353 --> 01:19:47,253
Jump!

808
01:19:47,844 --> 01:19:48,844
Good girl.

809
01:19:50,175 --> 01:19:51,175
Good girl.

810
01:19:51,563 --> 01:19:52,563
Good girl.

811
01:19:53,019 --> 01:19:54,019
Good girl.

812
01:20:57,832 --> 01:20:58,832
Thank you.

813
01:21:09,054 --> 01:21:10,054
One dollar.

814
01:21:11,181 --> 01:21:12,840
Oh, I thought they were 75.

815
01:21:12,893 --> 01:21:13,893
One dollar.

816
01:21:27,573 --> 01:21:28,573
Thank you.

817
01:21:34,053 --> 01:21:35,053
Chicken?

818
01:21:37,567 --> 01:21:38,567
Chick, chick.

819
01:21:43,045 --> 01:21:44,246
What are you doing?

820
01:21:50,813 --> 01:21:52,020
Hey, chicken boy.

821
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,641
I like your chicken.

822
01:22:02,173 --> 01:22:03,846
Don't you guys like his chicken?

823
01:22:05,741 --> 01:22:06,868
Hell, yeah.

824
01:22:09,734 --> 01:22:10,767
Let me see her?

825
01:22:13,667 --> 01:22:14,933
Sure, Duncan, buddy.

826
01:22:16,406 --> 01:22:17,528
I'm just kidding.

827
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:21,355
- Let me see her.
- Give her to me, Travis.

828
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:22,380
You want her?

829
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,760
Are we hanging out
tonight, Duncan?

830
01:22:24,785 --> 01:22:26,458
It ain't a party without you.

831
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:27,649
Please?

832
01:22:28,387 --> 01:22:29,493
Scotty, let me see her?

833
01:22:29,518 --> 01:22:31,618
How you doing?
It's good to see you.

834
01:22:31,643 --> 01:22:33,544
- Scotty, give her to me.
- How you doing?

835
01:22:34,124 --> 01:22:35,042
Scotty, please.

836
01:22:35,067 --> 01:22:36,679
I think something's
wrong with her, Duncan.

837
01:22:36,704 --> 01:22:38,425
- Scotty, please.
- She doesn't look too good.

838
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:40,585
- Is she sick, Scotty?
- I think she might be.

839
01:22:40,609 --> 01:22:42,901
- Scotty, please.
- Aw, chicken boy lost his chick.

840
01:22:43,352 --> 01:22:44,951
Take her, Perry. You want her?

841
01:22:44,976 --> 01:22:45,976
Trav...

842
01:22:47,479 --> 01:22:48,887
What the fuck you looking at?

843
01:22:50,827 --> 01:22:51,954
Perry, what happened?

844
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:54,100
What are you, a moron?

845
01:22:55,967 --> 01:22:57,320
What do you think happened?

846
01:23:01,453 --> 01:23:02,453
Happy now?

847
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,446
Perry, put your shirt down, man.

848
01:23:12,608 --> 01:23:13,608
Faggot!

849
01:23:14,648 --> 01:23:15,888
I'm not a faggot.

850
01:23:16,148 --> 01:23:17,048
Oh...

851
01:23:17,481 --> 01:23:18,481
truth hurts.

852
01:23:18,947 --> 01:23:20,593
Doesn't it, ass humper?

853
01:23:20,852 --> 01:23:21,852
I'm not!

854
01:23:24,527 --> 01:23:26,733
Scotty, Scotty, Scotty, no!

855
01:23:26,825 --> 01:23:27,727
Scotty!

856
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:29,485
Scotty? Scotty, don't!

857
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:31,509
What's wrong, chicken?

858
01:23:31,675 --> 01:23:33,343
We're just fucking with you.

859
01:23:34,161 --> 01:23:35,061
No!

860
01:23:36,632 --> 01:23:38,275
- No, Perry!
- Fuck, yeah! Break its neck!

861
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:39,993
- Kill it, Perry!
- Kill it, fucking kill it!

862
01:23:40,017 --> 01:23:41,113
- Kill it!
- Perry, kill it!

863
01:23:41,138 --> 01:23:42,138
Fuck, yeah! Kill it!

864
01:23:42,163 --> 01:23:44,052
Perry... Perry...

865
01:23:45,159 --> 01:23:46,059
Perry!

866
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,200
Perry, no.

867
01:23:53,573 --> 01:23:54,573
Let him go.

868
01:23:55,907 --> 01:23:58,013
What the fuck are
you talking about, man?

869
01:23:58,038 --> 01:23:58,938
What?

870
01:23:59,069 --> 01:24:00,069
Let him go.

871
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:05,880
Brent, what the fuck, Brent?

872
01:24:05,905 --> 01:24:06,602
Whoa.

873
01:24:06,627 --> 01:24:08,993
- What the fuck are you doing, Perry?
- Shh, shh, it's ok.

874
01:24:09,404 --> 01:24:11,326
You ain't no fucking fun
any more, Peraldo.

875
01:24:11,351 --> 01:24:13,684
Yeah, dude, you're such a wet
noodle or wet blanket or whatever.

876
01:24:13,709 --> 01:24:16,230
- Fucking wet something.
- Wet something, man.

877
01:24:22,087 --> 01:24:23,245
Let's get out of here.

878
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:28,560
I'm not a faggot, Perry.

879
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:38,609
Why don't you show us
how you suck it, fudge boy?

880
01:24:38,634 --> 01:24:40,007
Woo, yeah!

881
01:24:41,071 --> 01:24:43,059
Why don't you suck it like
your mother showed you?

882
01:24:43,084 --> 01:24:45,131
Excuse me, Mrs. Mudge,

883
01:24:45,156 --> 01:24:47,689
can you teach me
how to suck a dick?

884
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:00,914
Oh, shit, he did it!

885
01:25:01,974 --> 01:25:02,980
Motherfuck!

886
01:25:03,005 --> 01:25:04,527
Tastes like chicken.

887
01:25:05,655 --> 01:25:06,829
You weren't kidding, Perry.

888
01:25:06,854 --> 01:25:09,495
Hey, Duncan, what are you doing later?
You got any plans?

889
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,520
Faggot.

890
01:25:29,099 --> 01:25:30,320
Oh, shit!

891
01:25:31,414 --> 01:25:32,314
Shit.

892
01:25:32,601 --> 01:25:33,601
Oh, god.

893
01:25:34,187 --> 01:25:35,187
Fucking!

894
01:25:36,607 --> 01:25:37,847
Oh, Jesus Christ.

895
01:25:37,872 --> 01:25:40,384
You are cold-blooded,
chicken boy.

896
01:27:16,607 --> 01:27:17,794
What did you go and do?

897
01:27:18,252 --> 01:27:19,152
Huh?

898
01:27:22,727 --> 01:27:23,727
What happened?

899
01:27:26,693 --> 01:27:27,693
What happened?

900
01:27:33,721 --> 01:27:35,194
I gotta go deal with it.

901
01:27:37,407 --> 01:27:38,407
Let me go.

902
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:40,054
- Let me go.
- No.

903
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:41,665
Let me go. Let me go!

904
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:42,590
No.

905
01:27:49,254 --> 01:27:50,654
Let me go.

906
01:27:52,293 --> 01:27:53,660
Let me go.

907
01:27:55,933 --> 01:27:57,693
Let me go.

908
01:28:02,568 --> 01:28:04,154
- Let me go.
- No.

909
01:28:20,207 --> 01:28:21,207
I love you.
