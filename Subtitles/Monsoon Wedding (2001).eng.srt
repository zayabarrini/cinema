1
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,896
Pimmi, please bring the phone.

2
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,465
Darling, you want something else?
Tea? Nimbu pani?

3
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:23,874
No, no. That bloody bastard Dubey
hasn't come yet.

4
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:43,596
Alice?

5
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:50,568
Pimmi, I'm sorry to say,
but Lalit takes on too much tension.

6
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:52,299
It’s not good.

7
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:55,467
You see all these young men
getting heart attacks these days.

8
00:03:58,178 --> 00:04:00,442
And Lalit is doing everything
single-handedly.

9
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:45,414
Left, left, you idiot!
You want to spoil-

10
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:47,187
Stop the car!

11
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:48,888
You'll spoil the decorations also.

12
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:51,557
Don't you even know how to drive?
I've only got one hand to drive with.

13
00:04:51,632 --> 00:04:54,965
Who told you to break your hand
at this time, idiot? Where were you?

14
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:56,730
I went to the airport to get
your sister and her husband.

15
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:59,170
Where are they?
I didn't see them.

16
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:02,840
What do you mean, you didn't see them?

17
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:07,471
Hold up a placard:
"Mr. and Mrs. Tej Puri from USA."

18
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:09,846
They could have seen you.

19
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:12,249
Why are you yawning so much?
I've hardly slept.

20
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,549
Not to mention I got back
from Australia just yesterday.

21
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:16,988
You young people!

22
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:19,651
What do you need
to sleep so much for?

23
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:21,888
What time is the flight coming?
About 9:00.

24
00:05:21,962 --> 00:05:24,795
Make sure you're there on time.
And take this car, okay?

25
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:28,266
And only run the AC
when you've received them.

26
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:30,963
And park this car somewhere else!
Chill.

27
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,097
And take off that stupid topi.

28
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,808
Where the hell
are those girls?

29
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,845
Oh, God, Varun,
what are you doing with that?

30
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:46,215
Why haven't you got ready?
Didn't you hear Papa?

31
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:51,417
- He's getting so angry.
- It’s the last step. Coconut curry, Ma.

32
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:55,121
No, no. Now, hurry up.
Don't give me a hard time.

33
00:05:55,195 --> 00:05:57,857
And this TV. I'm so sick of it!
Take this off. Hurry up.

34
00:05:57,931 --> 00:06:00,399
Ma, what are you doing?
I'll do it myself.

35
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:02,458
What "wear it yourself"?
I'll wear it myself.

36
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,697
The guests are on their way.

37
00:06:04,772 --> 00:06:06,933
Did you change your underwear?
Ma!

38
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:09,168
What "Ma"? Did you?

39
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,643
Out with the truth! Are you wearing
dirty ones from yesterday?

40
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:16,115
- I just hope they're not smelling.
You're such a silly little boy.

41
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:18,947
"Little"?
Oh, God!

42
00:06:26,026 --> 00:06:28,085
Just because India has gone global...

43
00:06:28,162 --> 00:06:29,823
should we embrace everything?

44
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:31,990
What about our ancient culture?

45
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:34,899
Our tradition? Our values?

46
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:37,334
You are saying
censorship is unnecessary.

47
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:40,498
- Absolutely unnecessary.
- What is your response, Mr. Bhatt?

48
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:43,236
Let's take the example of America.

49
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,801
This is not America.
This is India.

50
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:55,485
You think just because you wear
handloom and speak in Hindi...

51
00:06:55,556 --> 00:06:57,956
that you represent the common man?

52
00:06:58,025 --> 00:06:59,253
Well, you don't.

53
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:01,521
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...

54
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:05,463
one of our top dubbists in Delhi,
Shivani Tanakiya.

55
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,976
- This is what the common man hears.
- So, somebody enjoying sex.

56
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:01,316
So what's the problem?

57
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:03,413
We have to take a short break,
ladies and gentlemen,

58
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,755
but please stay tuned to Delhi dot com.

59
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:25,007
Hi.
Hi.

60
00:08:31,985 --> 00:08:34,579
How have you been?
Fine.

61
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:39,183
Are you happy?

62
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,291
Yeah.

63
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,231
I miss you.

64
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:55,571
Oh, hi, Aditi. I'm sorry.

65
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:58,907
- We're starting in 20 seconds.
- I'll be right there.

66
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:00,674
Sorry.

67
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,611
I have to go.

68
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:15,690
Call me.

69
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:24,103
Aditi, why are you doing this?
What? What am I doing?

70
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:26,105
I don't think
you're ready for marriage.

71
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:28,641
I just want to settle down.
So what do you do?

72
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:30,973
Get married to some guy
selected by Mummy and Daddy?

73
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:32,841
You've known him
for a couple of weeks!

74
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:35,473
You are so mature, Aditi.

75
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:39,178
I can't wait around to see if Vikram's
wife will agree to divorce him.

76
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:43,019
I've read too many magazines, Ria.
I know it may never happen.

77
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,684
Do you get all your life directions
from fucking Cosmopolitan?

78
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,283
Don't get superior with me.

79
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:50,421
We're family, and I can tell you
what I think, and I will.

80
00:09:50,497 --> 00:09:52,192
That's right.

81
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:54,257
My older, unmarried cousin Ria.

82
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,829
What would she know about passion?

83
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:04,367
I didn't mean that, Didi.

84
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:08,540
For all this talk of passion,
how about marrying for love, Aditi?

85
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:13,938
There's a Tempo in the middle
of the driveway.

86
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:19,517
We had to go to the tailor and then-

87
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:22,419
But people are about to arrive
and you're not dressed yet!

88
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:25,356
Come on, hurry up.
You're looking very handsome today.

89
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:28,788
Hurry up and get ready.

90
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:33,856
Take it easy.

91
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:35,902
What are you doing here?
Just chillin'.

92
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:37,903
Just chilling.
Idiot.

93
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:41,834
Hi, Mom. I'm back.

94
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:43,188
Aliya? God, what are you doing here?

95
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:51,062
You're so disgusting.
Get out now! Out!

96
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:56,508
Out!
What does this word mean?

97
00:13:56,576 --> 00:13:59,374
- How come you're so irritating?
- How come you're still unmarried?

98
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:21,196
Hello, sweetie.

99
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,103
What does this word mean?

100
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:33,208
It’s "uxorious. "

101
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,010
It’s "uxorious. "
Uxorious?

102
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:01,633
So you are facing this way as barman?

103
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,905
I'm the barman, facing this way,
and this acts as a roof.

104
00:15:04,978 --> 00:15:06,912
No need to be happy
about being the barman.

105
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,710
You're not supposed to touch
one drop of the stuff. Understand?

106
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,774
A barman should be absolutely sober.

107
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:15,116
Keep this list, and make sure
the servants don't swipe anything...

108
00:15:15,188 --> 00:15:18,851
and make small drinks for everybody,
not too large.

109
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:21,792
The whiskey hasn't come yet!
Uday was supposed to bring it.

110
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:25,319
Here he comes.
My unpunctual brother.

111
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,162
Good morning.

112
00:15:28,235 --> 00:15:31,602
What do you think?

113
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:33,969
We got real scotch from Uday's client.

114
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,702
- Thank you, Sona.
- Hi, Lalo Uncle.

115
00:15:36,776 --> 00:15:39,142
- Why aren't you staying with us?
- I have to study for my exams.

116
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:41,646
I hope my little Aliya
didn't trouble you.

117
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:43,615
No, she's such a little delight.

118
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:52,049
Pick it up and take it in.

119
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,593
This is no time
for family members to arrive.

120
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:57,960
It’s only 4:00.

121
00:15:58,031 --> 00:16:00,158
Just relax!

122
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:03,259
Ayesha, this is C.L. Uncle
and Shashi Auntie's son Rahul.

123
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:05,497
They live in Dubai.
Muscat, actually.

124
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:07,062
Yeah, Muscat, okay.

125
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,702
You have a tattoo.
Yeah.

126
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:32,061
Okay, bye.

127
00:16:44,577 --> 00:16:46,374
I think your cousin Rahul
would really like it.

128
00:16:47,614 --> 00:16:49,275
You have to know this.

129
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:52,284
I heard your mother tell him and sister
your bra size was 36C.

130
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:55,719
- Why would she do that?
- Sorry, but it's 32A.

131
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:58,121
I know that,
but we can't tell them.

132
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,094
Pimmi, come on!

133
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,930
The groom's here!

134
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:10,863
Oh, shit.

135
00:17:14,474 --> 00:17:16,374
Welcome, welcome.

136
00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:22,080
Thank you, thank you.

137
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:27,614
This is Pimmi's brother from Muscat.

138
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:29,450
Rahul, come here!

139
00:17:34,194 --> 00:17:36,788
It’s okay, it's okay.

140
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,661
Hello, young man. How are you?

141
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,970
Have you got the blue box?

142
00:17:55,415 --> 00:17:59,545
So, excited?
Soon to be in family way!

143
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:07,091
So, you like India?
Yeah.

144
00:18:08,194 --> 00:18:10,219
Better than Houston, no?

145
00:18:10,296 --> 00:18:12,958
Good, good, good.
India needs young men like you.

146
00:18:13,032 --> 00:18:18,595
Yes, computer engineers
are India's biggest export.

147
00:18:19,572 --> 00:18:22,666
Am I a coolie or what?

148
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:26,670
Bhai-sahab,
what would you like to drink?

149
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:28,907
Scotch, please on the "rockiolis. "

150
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,974
"Rockiolis" means ice?
Two lumps, exactly.

151
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:33,712
Exactly.

152
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:35,652
I'll have the same, thanks.

153
00:18:35,722 --> 00:18:37,747
Uh "rockioli. "

154
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:40,726
Rahul, two whiskies here.

155
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:43,228
Two cubes of ice exactly.

156
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:46,459
Oh, my goodness. Look at you!

157
00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:51,301
How lovely you look.

158
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:55,870
Rockioli, rockioli.
Mrs. Rai over there.

159
00:19:03,283 --> 00:19:05,012
Hi. Congratulations.
Hi.

160
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,743
Hi.
Hi. How are you?

161
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:33,574
Fine.

162
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:47,292
I must have another drink.

163
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:57,429
Rahul, idiot, come here.

164
00:19:57,504 --> 00:19:59,404
Come here and hold
the camera. Listen.

165
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:01,406
Look at them.
How handsome Hemant is.

166
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:08,345
Come on, put it on.
Camera on!

167
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,980
On the ring!

168
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,931
Thank you.

169
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,433
Just in time!

170
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,777
This is Varun?
He's almost a young man.

171
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:46,809
How did you manage? I sent Rahul
to airport, told me flight was late.

172
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:50,686
No, it was not late. Nobody was there
at the airport, so we took a cab.

173
00:20:50,757 --> 00:20:53,555
- You had to take a cab?
- It’s okay.

174
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:55,821
Rahul, you idiot, I sent you
to the airport to receive them.

175
00:20:55,895 --> 00:20:57,863
You come back and tell me
the flight was late?

176
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:03,435
He's been working day and night.
He doesn't know India.

177
00:21:03,503 --> 00:21:05,801
But he's number one
most stupid duffer.

178
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:08,170
I'm sorry to say,
but I don't like this!

179
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,383
Bhai-sahab, this is Mr. Tej Puri,
married to my sister Vijaya.

180
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:23,320
After my older brother
Surinder bhai-sahab passed away...

181
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:26,415
Tej bhai has been
the hero of the family.

182
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:30,155
He has really looked after us.
Come and meet Hemant.

183
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:32,424
Yes. Excuse me.

184
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:34,329
Excuse me.

185
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:42,934
You know how difficult it was
to get tickets at this time of the year?

186
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:45,773
Difficult or not, we would have brought
you here first-class if we had to.

187
00:21:45,845 --> 00:21:48,643
We couldn't have had the shadi
without you, my darling sister.

188
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:52,242
Nothing would have stopped us.

189
00:21:58,091 --> 00:22:00,025
Ria!

190
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:02,653
Is that you? Come here.

191
00:22:03,763 --> 00:22:06,425
Come here, come here.

192
00:22:12,705 --> 00:22:14,605
God bless. Very good.

193
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,794
- Paaji, would you like a cigar?
- I quit.

194
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:33,335
Tej bhai-sahab, I wanted
to talk to you about Ria's plans.

195
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:36,904
Ria, come here a minute, please.

196
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:40,886
- Ria wants to study in America.
- Is that so?

197
00:24:40,953 --> 00:24:42,682
We're hoping you could give us
some advice.

198
00:24:42,755 --> 00:24:43,881
What do you want to do?

199
00:24:43,956 --> 00:24:46,424
I'm applying
for creative writing programs.

200
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:48,551
- She wants to be a writer.
- Very good.

201
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:51,529
Have you thought of the budget?
Where will the money will come from?

202
00:24:51,597 --> 00:24:54,760
My teacher's salary?

203
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:57,632
Why can't she be like Aditi and do
the right thing at the right time?

204
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:10,271
Absolutely! Just one book.
Who knows? It might happen.

205
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:11,714
You must go to the States.

206
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:14,446
You know saada Umang
is also there.

207
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,648
- You must give us his phone number.
- He's coming here tonight.

208
00:25:17,723 --> 00:25:20,021
We're hoping Ria and Umang
will like each other.

209
00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:24,258
What are the chances
of getting hooked?

210
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,730
Bad.

211
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,800
Save the jokes for the sangeet.
He'll be the MC at the sangeet.

212
00:26:38,037 --> 00:26:41,006
Varun, out!

213
00:26:41,874 --> 00:26:43,705
What's your problem anyway?

214
00:26:52,885 --> 00:26:55,479
Varun, what happened to you?

215
00:26:55,554 --> 00:26:58,114
Mrs. Mehta speaking. Who's this?

216
00:26:59,225 --> 00:27:03,389
Okay, okay, I have
an announcement to make.

217
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:07,193
I'm thinking that if Ria wants
to study in America...

218
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:09,359
I will fund her entire education.

219
00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:13,170
No, no arguments.

220
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:15,571
This is my family.

221
00:27:19,445 --> 00:27:21,572
You see, Lalit,
Ria is a sensible girl.

222
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:24,673
If she wants to write,
we must encourage her.

223
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,015
I can still work.

224
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:31,750
This is final!
We'll talk about it later, okay?

225
00:27:31,824 --> 00:27:33,849
Now you tell us what needs
to be done for the wedding.

226
00:27:33,926 --> 00:27:37,089
Absolutely. Now you don't have
to worry about anything.

227
00:27:38,931 --> 00:27:41,764
Anything.

228
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:49,738
My God, I don't know what to say.

229
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:54,041
This is enough for me
that we are all here together.

230
00:27:54,113 --> 00:27:57,241
My God! Pimmi, it's wonderful, no?
After so many years.

231
00:27:57,316 --> 00:28:00,046
After Surinder bhai-sahab passed away...

232
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:05,557
I think this is the first time
the whole family's here together.

233
00:28:06,592 --> 00:28:10,551
Ria, Ria, Ria.

234
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:16,091
Don't cry.
I know you are missing him.

235
00:28:16,168 --> 00:28:18,864
We are all missing your father.

236
00:28:32,852 --> 00:28:36,049
Dubey!

237
00:28:44,397 --> 00:28:46,797
Rahul, go start the generator.

238
00:28:46,866 --> 00:28:49,232
- I don't even know where it is.
- Behind the house, idiot!

239
00:28:49,301 --> 00:28:50,893
Come, I'll show you.

240
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,064
Umang?
Yeah, just hold on a sec.

241
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,904
It’s very unclear.
Hello?

242
00:28:56,976 --> 00:29:00,275
When are you arriving?

243
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:06,180
Hello, hello?

244
00:30:38,777 --> 00:30:41,245
Think you can handle it?
Yeah, sure.

245
00:32:55,381 --> 00:32:57,440
- Hi.
- Hi.

246
00:32:59,285 --> 00:33:01,310
I'm glad I got some exercise.

247
00:33:01,387 --> 00:33:04,322
All I've been doing is
eating and eating and eating.

248
00:33:06,825 --> 00:33:08,725
I'm sorry I had to
wake you up this early...

249
00:33:08,794 --> 00:33:13,254
but this is the only time
we're gonna have on our own.

250
00:33:13,332 --> 00:33:15,892
There's just so many ceremonies.

251
00:33:15,968 --> 00:33:18,562
And I don't even know
who's who half the time.

252
00:33:18,637 --> 00:33:20,298
I know what you mean.

253
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:23,466
I wanted to talk to you about our-
Here's the coffee, ma'am.

254
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:26,602
Thank you.
Do you want something?

255
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:29,648
I'll have a salt lassi, please.
Sure, I'll get it.

256
00:33:35,654 --> 00:33:38,054
I want to know what's on your mind.

257
00:33:38,123 --> 00:33:41,718
Sleep! That's all
that's on my mind right now.

258
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,191
I saw you with your family yesterday.

259
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,763
You guys are so close.

260
00:33:51,837 --> 00:33:54,067
Sometimes...

261
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:57,939
I worry about how it will be
for you in America.

262
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,410
You might just feel so alone.

263
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:02,242
I'm sure I can handle it.

264
00:34:02,314 --> 00:34:05,442
It'll be really nice to get away
from this damned place.

265
00:34:05,517 --> 00:34:07,280
Why? You don't like Delhi?

266
00:34:07,353 --> 00:34:09,685
No, I love India.

267
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:13,384
I mean, I don't care. America's
gonna be new for me anyway.

268
00:34:13,459 --> 00:34:16,053
My fiancée.

269
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:19,359
Sorry, I'm just not a morning person.

270
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,465
Vicky, is it okay
if I join the four-ball today?

271
00:34:25,671 --> 00:34:28,196
No, no, I'll be there 100%.

272
00:34:28,273 --> 00:34:31,333
I'll be there. Don't worry. Okay, bye.

273
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:35,208
Pimmi.

274
00:34:36,548 --> 00:34:39,381
Pimmi.

275
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:42,477
What are you doing inside?
Nothing.

276
00:34:42,554 --> 00:34:44,920
Nothing.
I know very well what you're doing.

277
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:48,322
Open up. I have to get ready.
Just a minute.

278
00:34:53,232 --> 00:34:57,134
If you must hide and smoke,
at least use a better air freshener.

279
00:34:57,202 --> 00:34:58,760
I was a little tense.

280
00:34:58,837 --> 00:35:02,273
Tense? You're going shopping!
I'm the one who should be tense.

281
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:06,107
I'm doing it for our darling daughter.
You saw how much they gave us.

282
00:35:06,178 --> 00:35:08,271
We can't look bad
in front of our in-laws.

283
00:35:08,347 --> 00:35:10,315
We'll look good with you
smoking in front of them.

284
00:35:10,382 --> 00:35:13,408
Well, doesn't Saroj drink?

285
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:15,783
Anyway, just let me go
and do it, okay?

286
00:35:15,854 --> 00:35:18,379
Well, Pimmi goes shopping again.

287
00:35:18,457 --> 00:35:20,948
And I'm telling you,
it's gonna cost us.

288
00:35:21,026 --> 00:35:23,824
So what? I'll arrange the money like
I've been organizing everything else.

289
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:29,056
You've organized everything else?

290
00:35:29,134 --> 00:35:32,592
Who's been nonstop on her toes
for days? Just tell me that.

291
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,843
Thank you so much
for working so hard.

292
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:44,348
Take off your curlers at least!

293
00:36:29,828 --> 00:36:32,695
Alice.
Alice.

294
00:37:27,553 --> 00:37:29,077
Email?

295
00:39:50,762 --> 00:39:53,458
Shit! Dubey!

296
00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:00,730
Yes, sir?

297
00:40:03,341 --> 00:40:06,833
Yes, sir?
Dubey.

298
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,643
Yes sir.
What's this "yes sir"?

299
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:30,927
Okay.

300
00:40:53,525 --> 00:40:55,618
Advance? What for?

301
00:40:55,694 --> 00:40:57,559
Waterproofing, meaning more money.

302
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:29,852
Five thousand dollars.
Exactly and approximately.

303
00:42:04,696 --> 00:42:08,097
Thank God it's air-conditioned.

304
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,031
Mom, I'm just going to have a chuski.

305
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:14,663
Just one.

306
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,392
By God, it's fabulous!

307
00:42:52,177 --> 00:42:53,576
Aditi.

308
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,573
What are you doing? They're
waiting for your approval inside.

309
00:43:01,052 --> 00:43:03,748
I don't really know how Hemant thinks,
what he expects of me.

310
00:43:03,822 --> 00:43:05,653
So call him instead of Vikram.

311
00:43:05,724 --> 00:43:09,182
Now go inside before those aunties come
and dance on our head.

312
00:43:10,428 --> 00:43:12,225
Thank you.

313
00:43:17,903 --> 00:43:20,770
Hey, you want a lift, baby?

314
00:43:35,787 --> 00:43:37,812
Aliya, go and sit.

315
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,956
We can try the sitting step,
and then the chunri khenchna step.

316
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:06,815
Hi, sexy.

317
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:14,152
So, Sydney boy, can you move to this?

318
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,567
What's going on, guys?

319
00:44:30,408 --> 00:44:32,069
Come on, didi. That's enough.

320
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,072
God.

321
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:41,444
Not more interruptions!
We'll never get this right.

322
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:44,886
What is it, Rahul? We're rehearsing
for the sangeet. What do you want?

323
00:47:38,396 --> 00:47:41,593
Lalit and Sam are partners,
and Vicky and me.

324
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:43,600
Let's take them on, partner.

325
00:47:45,503 --> 00:47:47,971
That's a great shot, partner.

326
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:51,372
Thanks, Rajeev.
Great shot there. Good shooting.

327
00:47:51,442 --> 00:47:53,706
Thank God we're partners.

328
00:47:53,778 --> 00:47:55,973
I have to talk to you
about something, Rajeev.

329
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,217
Rajeev, I was wondering if-
How's Pimmi?

330
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,383
She's fine.
How are the preparations going?

331
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:09,585
Preparations? First-class.

332
00:48:09,661 --> 00:48:14,689
But, Sam, I'm having
a cash-flow problem.

333
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:18,167
I was hoping to borrow some money
just to tide over this wedding expense.

334
00:48:21,806 --> 00:48:23,740
When do you think you'll be able
to return it, partner?

335
00:48:23,808 --> 00:48:27,141
Next month. I have a huge shipment
going to Macy's next month.

336
00:48:27,212 --> 00:48:32,115
Hey, guys, Mr. Verma here has got
some serious cash-flow problems.

337
00:48:34,686 --> 00:48:37,678
Thank God I don't have any
daughters

338
00:48:37,755 --> 00:48:41,885
- You've got a high-maintenance wife.
- But she's a self-financed Maharani.

339
00:48:45,263 --> 00:48:47,823
O women of the house

340
00:48:47,899 --> 00:48:49,867
Decorate me with henna

341
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,888
Hey, idiot, come on!
Let's enter the harem!

342
00:50:54,959 --> 00:50:56,654
Arre, ladies!

343
00:51:00,665 --> 00:51:05,728
C.L. has an item which is
most suitable for ladies. Please!

344
00:51:15,747 --> 00:51:19,649
So, Varun, enjoying yourself
among all the women?

345
00:51:32,997 --> 00:51:36,592
Be a good girl. Don't say no.

346
00:51:36,667 --> 00:51:39,966
Open your mouth.
Do you like it?

347
00:51:41,072 --> 00:51:42,972
Be a good girl
and open your mouth.

348
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,974
There's only this much left.

349
00:51:46,878 --> 00:51:48,869
Hi.
Hi. What?

350
00:51:48,946 --> 00:51:51,141
Hi. Nice mehndi, Ria.

351
00:51:55,286 --> 00:51:57,311
She's angry, eh?

352
00:52:00,258 --> 00:52:03,455
Okay. Ria didi will give you
samosa, okay?

353
00:52:07,532 --> 00:52:09,591
- What were you doing here?
- Eating a big samosa.

354
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:11,157
Why?
Because I'm hungry.

355
00:52:11,235 --> 00:52:14,329
- No, why are you eating it here?
- Because the samosas were in here.

356
00:52:14,405 --> 00:52:16,270
Why was he with you, Aliya?
Who?

357
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,500
Tej Uncle.

358
00:52:17,575 --> 00:52:20,544
Alice said the samosas
were on the top shelf...

359
00:52:20,611 --> 00:52:24,377
and Tej Uncle came
to get the box down for me.

360
00:52:26,484 --> 00:52:29,419
Okay, let's do a nakkushi.

361
00:52:29,487 --> 00:52:33,218
I love you, Ria didi.
I love you too, my baby.

362
00:52:55,947 --> 00:52:56,936
Alice.

363
00:53:03,688 --> 00:53:04,677
Alice.

364
00:55:05,843 --> 00:55:08,334
You know, Pimmi...

365
00:55:08,412 --> 00:55:11,074
sometimes when I look at them...

366
00:55:13,317 --> 00:55:19,222
I feel love which I almost cannot bear.

367
00:55:31,902 --> 00:55:35,133
And when did we grow old?

368
00:56:05,169 --> 00:56:07,865
If only their lives are happy.

369
00:56:12,176 --> 00:56:17,170
For that I'm willing to take on every
trouble, every sorrow, in the world.

370
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:48,140
- Need anything, beta?
- I'm all right, thanks.

371
00:56:48,212 --> 00:56:50,203
Good night.

372
00:56:51,348 --> 00:56:53,009
Good night, idiot.

373
00:57:00,257 --> 00:57:02,589
I thought you weren't staying here.

374
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:05,493
I changed my mind.

375
00:57:05,563 --> 00:57:07,463
Really?

376
00:57:07,498 --> 00:57:10,228
How come you're not asleep as yet?

377
00:57:12,069 --> 00:57:14,162
Just thinking.

378
00:57:14,238 --> 00:57:16,729
About what?

379
00:57:16,774 --> 00:57:18,969
About good Indian girls.

380
00:57:33,858 --> 00:57:37,191
Is this a scorpion?
Yeah. It’s my sign.

381
00:57:50,441 --> 00:57:53,569
I should go.
It’s okay.

382
00:58:24,141 --> 00:58:26,701
I should really go.
Don't go.

383
00:58:26,777 --> 00:58:28,711
Please don't.

384
00:58:44,662 --> 00:58:46,323
Idiot.

385
00:59:12,756 --> 00:59:14,747
Where would you like to go?

386
00:59:15,726 --> 00:59:19,753
I just want to drive
and drive and drive.

387
00:59:56,867 --> 00:59:58,801
Why did you come to see me?

388
01:00:00,037 --> 01:00:02,096
I...

389
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:07,208
wanted to be reminded
why I broke up with you.

390
01:00:32,569 --> 01:00:35,367
Somehow...

391
01:00:35,439 --> 01:00:37,373
I can't remember.

392
01:00:52,423 --> 01:00:55,688
What is it?

393
01:00:57,528 --> 01:01:00,019
What is it?

394
01:01:08,205 --> 01:01:10,673
Take me to the police station?
On what basis?

395
01:01:10,741 --> 01:01:14,973
Indecent exposure.
Obscenity.

396
01:01:17,581 --> 01:01:20,209
Don't be ridiculous!
Do we look like terrorists?

397
01:01:40,471 --> 01:01:42,496
Hello, darling.

398
01:01:47,311 --> 01:01:49,506
Yes, I know that.
I'll be home soon.

399
01:01:54,918 --> 01:01:58,513
There was an emergency. Yes.

400
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:01,649
No, don't worry. That's just
a television show in the background.

401
01:02:01,725 --> 01:02:04,057
Vikram, don't leave me with them.

402
01:02:22,446 --> 01:02:25,415
What are you doing?

403
01:03:04,455 --> 01:03:06,184
Lalit.

404
01:03:12,796 --> 01:03:14,991
Let me sleep, will you?

405
01:04:45,622 --> 01:04:47,385
So what are you
going to say to Hemant?

406
01:04:47,457 --> 01:04:50,187
- Everything.
- Oh, God. Then?

407
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:53,354
He's gonna tell me I'm a slut
and that I should get lost.

408
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:55,557
Adu.

409
01:04:55,632 --> 01:04:57,896
How could I have been so stupid?

410
01:04:57,968 --> 01:05:00,027
Are you sure you want
to tell Hemant everything?

411
01:05:00,103 --> 01:05:02,571
Everything's over
between you and Vikram now.

412
01:05:03,707 --> 01:05:07,302
Ria, I don't want to lie.

413
01:05:07,377 --> 01:05:11,746
I don't want to start something new
based on lies and deceit.

414
01:05:11,815 --> 01:05:15,012
It’s just so wrong.

415
01:05:15,085 --> 01:05:18,680
You liked Hemant, no?
Yeah.

416
01:05:18,755 --> 01:05:20,586
He's nice.

417
01:05:20,657 --> 01:05:22,921
He's good for you.

418
01:05:22,993 --> 01:05:25,587
I can't do this to him.

419
01:05:27,664 --> 01:05:30,565
I'm going mad!
What is this music?

420
01:05:30,634 --> 01:05:33,535
It’s Ayesha practicing
for the sangeet tonight.

421
01:05:34,538 --> 01:05:37,098
Maybe she shouldn't bother.
What?

422
01:05:37,174 --> 01:05:40,871
- Maybe she shouldn't bother.
- Adu!

423
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:51,282
I'm really glad you called...

424
01:05:51,355 --> 01:05:53,152
because I was gonna
call you myself this morning.

425
01:05:53,223 --> 01:05:55,953
Why? What happened?
Nothing happened.

426
01:05:56,026 --> 01:05:58,494
It was great
to see you alone yesterday...

427
01:05:58,562 --> 01:06:01,156
so I thought I'd try my luck again.

428
01:06:02,232 --> 01:06:05,133
You look really nice when you laugh.
Oh, yeah?

429
01:06:09,072 --> 01:06:11,404
I need to tell you something.

430
01:06:11,475 --> 01:06:13,568
You'll probably hate me
by the end of it...

431
01:06:17,581 --> 01:06:19,412
but I really need you to know.

432
01:06:19,483 --> 01:06:23,249
It’s okay.
I'm not gonna hate you.

433
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:29,587
This used to be my favorite haunt
during my IIT days.

434
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:31,594
Best chai in the world.

435
01:06:31,662 --> 01:06:34,722
It’s nice.
Yeah? I was hoping you'd like it.

436
01:07:07,998 --> 01:07:11,764
So, what was so important?

437
01:07:11,835 --> 01:07:14,030
You don't want to marry me anymore?

438
01:07:18,809 --> 01:07:20,276
Just look at these.

439
01:07:20,344 --> 01:07:22,209
Mama gave these to me
when I got married.

440
01:07:22,279 --> 01:07:25,009
Still so shiny and beautiful.

441
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:27,642
I never used them once.

442
01:07:27,718 --> 01:07:29,652
I just hope Aditi will use them.

443
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,813
Pimmi, what have you spread all over?

444
01:07:31,888 --> 01:07:34,288
I have to do my accounts
and I can't even find my papers.

445
01:07:34,358 --> 01:07:37,225
- Please don't keep this stuff here.
- Then get a computer.

446
01:07:37,294 --> 01:07:38,989
You won't need any paper.

447
01:07:39,062 --> 01:07:41,053
Computers can do everything
for you these days.

448
01:07:41,131 --> 01:07:43,395
I'm too old to learn
all this computer nonsense.

449
01:07:43,467 --> 01:07:46,595
And you know how much money
has already got spent?

450
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:48,900
You know how long it will take me
to repay all this?

451
01:07:48,972 --> 01:07:50,872
Don't worry so much, Lalit.

452
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:53,000
Our only daughter's getting married.

453
01:07:53,076 --> 01:07:55,340
Nothing's a waste.

454
01:07:56,346 --> 01:07:58,177
Look at these saris.

455
01:07:58,248 --> 01:08:01,274
You know I bought this one
in Madras 22 years ago?

456
01:08:02,219 --> 01:08:05,450
I've been collecting these
since the day Aditi was born.

457
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:09,585
This one is lovely.

458
01:08:12,696 --> 01:08:16,097
And tomorrow she'll be gone.

459
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:18,760
Just like that, in one day.

460
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,075
I'm sorry.

461
01:08:37,421 --> 01:08:40,322
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

462
01:09:47,591 --> 01:09:50,287
Couldn't help yourself, huh?

463
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:53,761
You had to drag me into your mess
as well. What am I supposed to do now?

464
01:09:55,499 --> 01:09:58,900
Mr. Verma, your daughter's
such a rosebud.

465
01:09:58,969 --> 01:10:01,437
We'll have a wonderful family
in Houston, Texas...

466
01:10:01,505 --> 01:10:03,905
be friends,
take our kids to Disneyland...

467
01:10:03,974 --> 01:10:05,771
send you tickets every year.

468
01:10:05,842 --> 01:10:07,469
It'll be lovely!

469
01:10:07,544 --> 01:10:09,102
But, hey, wait a minute.

470
01:10:09,179 --> 01:10:11,545
You didn't tell me she's still
screwing her ex-boyfriend...

471
01:10:11,615 --> 01:10:14,709
while you were fixing
her marriage.

472
01:10:14,784 --> 01:10:18,151
But that shouldn't be a problem.
I'm from America. We'll fit right in.

473
01:10:21,124 --> 01:10:23,558
I've been thinking, Lalit.

474
01:10:23,627 --> 01:10:26,061
I don't want to send Varun
to boarding school.

475
01:10:26,129 --> 01:10:28,825
- Don't start again.
- I don't want to lose both my children.

476
01:10:28,899 --> 01:10:31,390
Don't start over again, huh?
We've been through all this.

477
01:10:31,468 --> 01:10:34,096
He's going to boarding school,
and that's final.

478
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:36,832
He's wasting his life, staying here
watching TV the whole day.

479
01:10:37,641 --> 01:10:39,506
There's no one here to discipline him.

480
01:10:39,576 --> 01:10:42,374
I don't know what to do.

481
01:10:42,445 --> 01:10:45,175
He also needs love and affection.

482
01:10:45,248 --> 01:10:47,682
He's such a sensitive boy...

483
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:51,084
and he's so wonderful
with all these creative things.

484
01:10:51,688 --> 01:10:54,418
Creative things like
singing and dancing.

485
01:10:54,491 --> 01:10:56,721
cooking sesame chicken.

486
01:10:58,495 --> 01:11:01,760
Don't say that. Why do you always
look at everything like that?

487
01:11:01,831 --> 01:11:04,698
You know what he told Tej bhai-sahab
he wants to be when he grows up?

488
01:11:04,768 --> 01:11:07,202
What?
He said he wants to be a chef.

489
01:11:08,204 --> 01:11:11,367
I tell you.

490
01:11:13,843 --> 01:11:15,401
A cook!

491
01:11:15,478 --> 01:11:18,936
It doesn't mean anything.

492
01:11:19,015 --> 01:11:20,448
He's a fool.

493
01:11:20,517 --> 01:11:22,485
My son will be a man
when he grows up, understand?

494
01:11:22,552 --> 01:11:25,112
He'll be an educated professional.

495
01:11:25,188 --> 01:11:27,247
He won't be singing and dancing
in people's shadis.

496
01:11:27,324 --> 01:11:29,952
Mama.

497
01:11:30,026 --> 01:11:32,620
Can you do this for me?
Make a mucchi and on my eyes?

498
01:11:32,696 --> 01:11:35,256
Why, beta?
For my dance with Ayesha tonight.

499
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:36,924
Okay.

500
01:11:39,069 --> 01:11:41,629
Why can't you do something useful?

501
01:11:41,705 --> 01:11:45,402
Like some exercise or reading
your schoolbooks for a change.

502
01:11:45,475 --> 01:11:47,136
Look at you, a big huge hulk.

503
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:49,337
Can't spend your whole life
singing and dancing.

504
01:11:49,412 --> 01:11:52,472
- Why not?
- What do you mean, why not?

505
01:11:55,118 --> 01:11:57,552
You don't do any exercise.
You don't even play cricket.

506
01:11:57,621 --> 01:12:00,283
You don't read a book. Just sleeping
all day and watching TV...

507
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:02,257
and now this new nonsense, dancing!

508
01:12:02,325 --> 01:12:05,817
Why? You also took Mama's dupatta
and danced the night.

509
01:12:05,895 --> 01:12:07,658
Don't compare yourself with me.
You're just a kid.

510
01:12:07,731 --> 01:12:09,631
But right now
you said I'm big now.

511
01:12:10,767 --> 01:12:13,258
That's it. You're going
to boarding school. Decided!

512
01:12:13,336 --> 01:12:14,360
Since when?

513
01:12:14,437 --> 01:12:16,667
Beta, Papa and I
are only talking about it.

514
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:19,106
No, I have made up my mind.
We are not-

515
01:12:19,175 --> 01:12:20,972
Let me talk to him.

516
01:12:21,044 --> 01:12:22,602
It’s going to be good for you.

517
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:26,171
Soon Aditi's going away.
You'll be so lonely at home.

518
01:12:26,249 --> 01:12:29,650
So we thought you'd go to boarding
school. You'll have so much fun.

519
01:12:29,719 --> 01:12:32,483
You also have been trying
to send me away to boarding school.

520
01:12:32,555 --> 01:12:34,682
No, beta.

521
01:12:37,527 --> 01:12:39,654
That school is much better
than this school.

522
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:41,856
We thought you'll go there and
there'll be so many boys your age.

523
01:12:41,931 --> 01:12:44,195
- You'll really enjoy yourself.
- No, I don't want to go.

524
01:12:44,267 --> 01:12:46,360
I won't go.
You do what you want.

525
01:12:46,436 --> 01:12:48,404
We're just doing this
for your own good.

526
01:12:48,471 --> 01:12:51,201
It'll make you a bit tougher.
It'll be good for you.

527
01:12:51,274 --> 01:12:53,606
I hate you!
I hate you both!

528
01:12:53,677 --> 01:12:55,804
You don't even understand
one thing about me.

529
01:12:55,879 --> 01:12:57,847
Don't you talk to me like that!

530
01:12:57,914 --> 01:13:00,144
Fine! I just won't talk to you at all.

531
01:13:00,216 --> 01:13:01,843
Varun.
No.

532
01:13:01,918 --> 01:13:05,251
Please, son,
Leave me alone.

533
01:13:08,925 --> 01:13:11,553
Happy now?
Happy with what you've done?

534
01:13:11,628 --> 01:13:14,062
I didn't mean
to upset him like that.

535
01:13:15,365 --> 01:13:17,731
Why couldn't you say something?

536
01:13:17,801 --> 01:13:21,032
Don't talk to me, okay?
Just don't talk to me.

537
01:14:27,137 --> 01:14:29,196
Aditi.

538
01:14:31,975 --> 01:14:33,909
I'm sorry I lost it out there.

539
01:14:33,977 --> 01:14:36,969
I didn't have any right
to talk to you like that.

540
01:14:37,046 --> 01:14:39,640
You had every reason to be angry.

541
01:14:40,984 --> 01:14:43,475
Someone broke my heart too
a few years ago.

542
01:14:43,553 --> 01:14:48,422
I know how hard
and confusing it can be.

543
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:53,788
I really appreciate
your telling me about Vikram.

544
01:14:53,863 --> 01:14:56,923
You didn't have to but you did.

545
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,764
That honesty means a lot to me.

546
01:14:59,836 --> 01:15:03,397
I know it's a risk,
but what marriage isn't a risk?

547
01:15:03,473 --> 01:15:05,839
Whether our parents introduce us
or we meet in a club...

548
01:15:05,909 --> 01:15:08,434
what difference does it make?

549
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:21,180
I know we can put this behind us.

550
01:15:22,592 --> 01:15:24,355
I really do.

551
01:15:25,795 --> 01:15:28,423
I believe this can work.

552
01:15:29,766 --> 01:15:32,360
I believe we can be happy.

553
01:15:32,435 --> 01:15:35,836
As for the question of whether
we should get married or not...

554
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,704
it's really for you to answer.

555
01:19:01,644 --> 01:19:04,670
Here's yours.
Especially my mom.

556
01:19:06,249 --> 01:19:08,046
Yeah, exactly. Sure.

557
01:19:08,117 --> 01:19:10,847
How are you?
Very well. How are you doing?

558
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:16,119
Ladies and gentlemen,
attention, please.

559
01:19:16,192 --> 01:19:18,092
Welcome...

560
01:19:18,161 --> 01:19:21,597
beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful ladies...

561
01:19:21,664 --> 01:19:23,188
and gentlemen...

562
01:19:23,266 --> 01:19:26,827
and, of course, lovely children.

563
01:19:26,903 --> 01:19:31,135
Today's sangeet
for our beloved Aditi...

564
01:19:31,207 --> 01:19:35,644
and our dear son.
Son-in-law!

565
01:19:37,246 --> 01:19:40,079
and marriage will
take place tomorrow.

566
01:19:40,149 --> 01:19:44,085
Rahul, Rahul.

567
01:19:44,153 --> 01:19:46,121
Are you the only bartender here?

568
01:19:46,189 --> 01:19:48,248
I ordered a Bacardi Coke
20 minutes ago.

569
01:19:48,324 --> 01:19:50,155
- Just a second.
- Rahul.

570
01:19:50,226 --> 01:19:53,923
- Gin and tonic, no ice, lots of gin.
- Make that two.

571
01:19:53,996 --> 01:19:55,122
Sure.

572
01:20:05,808 --> 01:20:10,438
Move, man.
Sorry. Chill.

573
01:20:13,349 --> 01:20:17,251
Welcome.

574
01:20:24,193 --> 01:20:26,286
Who's that clown?

575
01:20:26,362 --> 01:20:28,262
That's my dad.

576
01:20:28,331 --> 01:20:31,823
Varun, you can't say no now.
Please, Varun!

577
01:20:31,901 --> 01:20:35,598
Listen,

578
01:20:35,671 --> 01:20:37,332
Varun, please.

579
01:20:37,406 --> 01:20:39,840
I told you, I don't care
about anything anymore.

580
01:20:39,909 --> 01:20:43,106
I don't care, and that's decided.

581
01:20:51,521 --> 01:20:55,218
In my opinion, you Punjabis
are way too ostentatious.

582
01:20:55,291 --> 01:20:58,886
In my opinion, you Bengalis
are way too pretentious.

583
01:20:58,961 --> 01:21:01,521
Touche, Ria.
This is Jibesh, Vandana.

584
01:21:01,597 --> 01:21:04,225
This is Mrs. Rai,
Aditi's ma-in-law to be.

585
01:21:11,774 --> 01:21:14,743
- Ria, get me a rum and Coke.
- Please go get it yourself.

586
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:18,871
Please. I would, but I know
so many people who know my parents.

587
01:21:18,948 --> 01:21:21,508
Please, just get it.

588
01:21:21,584 --> 01:21:24,644
- We will start this evening...
- Okay.

589
01:21:26,789 --> 01:21:28,916
with a spectacular item...

590
01:21:28,991 --> 01:21:33,428
by our own beloved Ayesha.

591
01:21:36,098 --> 01:21:38,658
What's the matter?
Varun won't do the dance anymore.

592
01:21:38,734 --> 01:21:43,103
Shit. I'm so sorry to hear that.
I don't know what to do-

593
01:21:43,172 --> 01:21:46,539
Rahul, you can do it. You've seen us
rehearse the steps so many times.

594
01:21:46,609 --> 01:21:48,941
- You're crazy!
- You can make up the steps as we go.

595
01:21:49,011 --> 01:21:50,501
You said you love to dance.

596
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:52,548
Please, I'm begging you.
I need your help.

597
01:21:52,615 --> 01:21:55,550
I can dance, but it's not
a nightclub in Melbourne, you know.

598
01:21:55,618 --> 01:21:57,882
I can't dance to this music.

599
01:21:57,954 --> 01:22:00,081
You're such a

600
01:22:03,659 --> 01:22:05,251
I just fell from grace.

601
01:22:05,328 --> 01:22:08,195
Darling, you have to be standing up
in order to be able to fall.

602
01:22:08,264 --> 01:22:12,223
If you keep sitting on your ass,
nothing's gonna happen.

603
01:22:23,379 --> 01:22:26,610
Meaning, sweetheart,
the main thing is...

604
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:29,147
you have to fight the battle.

605
01:23:35,518 --> 01:23:37,816
Come on, girl, that's it!

606
01:25:30,366 --> 01:25:33,767
Nobody is to sit.
Everybody come and dance!

607
01:26:12,775 --> 01:26:14,800
Come on.

608
01:27:37,693 --> 01:27:39,684
Let's stay up all night together.

609
01:27:42,164 --> 01:27:45,497
Really. Let's talk.

610
01:27:45,568 --> 01:27:48,731
Talk?
Why would you want to talk?

611
01:28:24,707 --> 01:28:26,675
Alice.

612
01:29:05,414 --> 01:29:07,678
Here comes my kissing cousin, Aditi.

613
01:29:10,019 --> 01:29:12,715
Hi, lovebirds.
Okay, okay.

614
01:29:12,788 --> 01:29:15,313
I can only handle
one woman at a time.

615
01:29:15,391 --> 01:29:16,858
Oh, really?

616
01:29:18,327 --> 01:29:20,989
Don't tire yourself out.
Tomorrow's the big night.

617
01:29:21,063 --> 01:29:23,691
And don't corrupt
my elder sister, huh?

618
01:29:38,947 --> 01:29:41,245
I don't like kissing.

619
01:29:41,316 --> 01:29:45,047
Typical man.

620
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:48,419
No, I get so confused about what to do.
Does your tongue go right in?

621
01:29:48,490 --> 01:29:50,685
Does it move around?
Does it stay still?

622
01:29:50,759 --> 01:29:54,752
- Makes me too nervous.
- Don't think. Just go with the flow.

623
01:29:56,565 --> 01:29:59,090
Don't think?
I wish I could do that.

624
01:29:59,168 --> 01:30:01,227
Kissing could be great...

625
01:30:01,303 --> 01:30:03,771
but my mind starts whizzing
with the weirdest thoughts...

626
01:30:03,839 --> 01:30:08,242
and suddenly I'm thinking of some banal,
practical thing to take care of.

627
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:11,370
I don't know what the big deal is.
I know all about kissing.

628
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:14,245
- Really, baby?
- Accha. Everything?

629
01:30:14,316 --> 01:30:16,181
Yeah, what's the big deal?

630
01:30:16,251 --> 01:30:17,445
No big deal.
It’s gross.

631
01:30:17,519 --> 01:30:20,386
You open your mouth
and he sticks his tongue in.

632
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:24,949
Don't you know?
That's how older people kiss.

633
01:30:29,898 --> 01:30:31,957
Let's go. I feel exhausted.

634
01:30:35,738 --> 01:30:38,366
Bye.
See you, Varun.

635
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:57,425
Mama, I want to sleep.

636
01:31:10,539 --> 01:31:12,268
Yeah, Mr. Culkin, one moment.

637
01:31:20,649 --> 01:31:22,480
I'll go help, huh?

638
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:30,515
She's so sleepy.

639
01:31:30,592 --> 01:31:33,459
I'll take her out for a drive, okay?

640
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:39,800
I don't want ice cream.

641
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,835
Strawberry ice cream?

642
01:31:48,243 --> 01:31:51,235
She's tired and cranky.
I thought I'd take her out for a drive.

643
01:31:53,348 --> 01:31:55,282
Yeah, sorry.

644
01:31:56,585 --> 01:31:59,748
Ria?
Ria, what's happening?

645
01:32:17,239 --> 01:32:19,799
- What's the matter, Ria?
- Just let her go.

646
01:32:23,712 --> 01:32:26,476
Let her go from what?
From you, you bastard!

647
01:32:26,548 --> 01:32:30,746
- Ria, have you gone mad?
- Maybe she's had too much to drink.

648
01:32:32,387 --> 01:32:34,446
What happened?

649
01:32:34,523 --> 01:32:37,890
It wasn't enough that he touched me
when I was a girl?

650
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,655
You had to teach Aliya
how older people kiss?

651
01:32:39,728 --> 01:32:42,196
- Ria, stop this nonsense.
- What did you get out of it?

652
01:32:42,264 --> 01:32:45,165
I didn't even have breasts,
you sick man!

653
01:32:48,237 --> 01:32:50,034
Seven afternoons.

654
01:32:50,105 --> 01:32:52,835
Seven afternoons
of how older people kiss?

655
01:32:52,908 --> 01:32:54,739
Ria.
You took my clothes off.

656
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:56,437
Ria stop!
Open your mouth Ria.

657
01:32:56,511 --> 01:32:58,274
Will you stop it?
Don't touch me!

658
01:32:58,347 --> 01:33:00,440
Don't touch me!

659
01:33:01,516 --> 01:33:03,245
Now he's doing it
all over again to Aliya.

660
01:33:03,318 --> 01:33:05,218
She's lying, Lalit. She's lying.

661
01:33:06,822 --> 01:33:08,687
You don't want to believe me?

662
01:33:08,757 --> 01:33:11,851
Then fine.
I'm not a part of this.

663
01:33:14,096 --> 01:33:16,030
I'm not a part of you.

664
01:33:17,599 --> 01:33:21,296
Say something, Lalit.
She's lying!

665
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:23,099
You know I don't lie, chachu.

666
01:33:23,171 --> 01:33:26,299
You know it!
You know I don't lie!

667
01:33:27,609 --> 01:33:29,338
She's lying, Lalit.

668
01:33:29,411 --> 01:33:31,971
Unmarried girls like Ria,
they make up all these fantasies.

669
01:33:32,047 --> 01:33:33,776
Ria, Ria.

670
01:33:33,849 --> 01:33:35,612
Ria.

671
01:33:35,684 --> 01:33:38,209
Ria, you can't go away like this.
Please.

672
01:33:45,661 --> 01:33:48,255
She's mad!

673
01:33:52,367 --> 01:33:54,392
The girl's going crazy!

674
01:33:59,508 --> 01:34:01,442
Lalit.

675
01:34:30,772 --> 01:34:33,639
Please, Mama.

676
01:37:19,107 --> 01:37:21,041
Ria?

677
01:37:24,045 --> 01:37:25,876
Ria?

678
01:37:30,118 --> 01:37:32,177
Ria.

679
01:37:40,695 --> 01:37:43,061
Come. I want you to come home
with me just now...

680
01:37:43,131 --> 01:37:45,622
and I don't want to listen
to anything, please.

681
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:47,634
Just change your clothes
and come home with me.

682
01:37:47,702 --> 01:37:51,399
- I'll wait for you in the other room.
- Don't pretend like nothing happened.

683
01:37:51,473 --> 01:37:53,338
Ria, I'm not pretending.
You are, you are!

684
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:55,968
I don't even know how to console you.

685
01:37:58,013 --> 01:38:00,379
What you have gone through,
I can't even imagine it.

686
01:38:07,322 --> 01:38:09,483
Ria, if you don't come home...

687
01:38:14,829 --> 01:38:16,660
Come home, Ria.

688
01:38:17,732 --> 01:38:20,997
I don't even know what to do.

689
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:25,331
I don't know what to do, Ria.

690
01:38:25,407 --> 01:38:27,341
My hands are tied.

691
01:38:27,409 --> 01:38:31,607
Tej bhai-sahab and our family
goes back a very long way.

692
01:38:39,921 --> 01:38:41,718
Then why are you punishing me?

693
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:45,157
I'm not.
And your sister and your mother?

694
01:38:45,227 --> 01:38:49,254
Listen to me.
I cannot break up my family.

695
01:38:50,332 --> 01:38:52,129
I cannot.

696
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,691
Please don't ask me
to make that choice.

697
01:38:55,770 --> 01:39:01,037
I don't know what Surinder bhai-sahab
would have done in my position.

698
01:39:01,109 --> 01:39:03,600
I know I can never
replace your father...

699
01:39:03,678 --> 01:39:06,078
but you're my child now.

700
01:39:10,518 --> 01:39:13,510
My family means everything to me.

701
01:39:15,156 --> 01:39:16,987
Please don't leave us.

702
01:39:19,294 --> 01:39:20,886
Please.

703
01:39:23,698 --> 01:39:25,689
Ria, if you go...

704
01:39:53,395 --> 01:39:55,955
- What's your name, little girl?
- Aliya.

705
01:40:00,335 --> 01:40:03,600
Very nice.
Look up. Smile.

706
01:40:03,672 --> 01:40:05,663
Okay, smile.

707
01:40:06,708 --> 01:40:10,007
Very nice. Beautiful.
What a lovely family.

708
01:40:11,079 --> 01:40:13,547
What's your name, please?

709
01:40:13,615 --> 01:40:16,345
Ria.

710
01:40:16,418 --> 01:40:18,784
Come in front.

711
01:40:31,633 --> 01:40:33,225
Hold it.

712
01:40:33,301 --> 01:40:35,098
Eyes wide open...

713
01:40:35,170 --> 01:40:37,195
and one, two-

714
01:40:37,272 --> 01:40:40,366
Everybody now, smile together,
and watch the birdie.

715
01:40:42,277 --> 01:40:44,745
And three. Very good.

716
01:40:44,813 --> 01:40:47,577
Okay, last picture.
Big smile, please.

717
01:40:49,184 --> 01:40:51,015
Okay, thank you.

718
01:41:06,101 --> 01:41:08,501
I miss you so much, Papa.

719
01:42:26,414 --> 01:42:28,314
I'll go out and receive the guests.
No.

720
01:42:35,223 --> 01:42:37,589
I can't do this.

721
01:42:37,659 --> 01:42:39,354
I can't. I'm sorry.

722
01:42:39,427 --> 01:42:43,864
Lalit.
I don't even want you here. Please.

723
01:42:43,932 --> 01:42:47,993
I cannot allow this, bhai.

724
01:42:48,069 --> 01:42:49,866
I cannot.

725
01:42:50,872 --> 01:42:54,672
Both of you just leave my home
and my family and go.

726
01:42:54,742 --> 01:42:57,768
- Lalit, what are you say-
- I don't want to say any more.

727
01:42:57,846 --> 01:42:59,541
Please don't make it worse.

728
01:42:59,614 --> 01:43:04,347
No, I don't want to say anything.
Please don't make it worse.

729
01:43:07,388 --> 01:43:09,049
These are my children, raji...

730
01:43:10,058 --> 01:43:13,027
and I will protect them
from myself even if I have to.

731
01:43:13,094 --> 01:43:14,823
Please go.
