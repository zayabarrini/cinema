1
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:41,991
THIS IS MY DESIRE

2
00:01:13,684 --> 00:01:15,666
Come in, factory, come in.

3
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:19,420
<i>I read you.</i>

4
00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:22,277
Try the roller.

5
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:26,800
<i>It's working.</i>

6
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,899
<i>It's working.
I said it's working.</i>

7
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:31,329
Okay.

8
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:09,648
<i>They earn more than the Senators in the US.</i>

9
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:13,974
<i>In fact, Nigerian Senators earn more
than the US President...</i>

10
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:18,166
<i>They think we are fools.</i>

11
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:21,797
<i>So it's up to Nigerians.
I'm not talking about reform...</i>

12
00:02:21,997 --> 00:02:24,791
<i>I'm talking about revolution.</i>

13
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,000
21, 22, 23, 24,
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

14
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:44,524
What is it?

15
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:47,068
Madame, the junction boxes...
all of them...

16
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,108
they're unmanageable.

17
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:50,934
What do you mean by that?

18
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:54,166
Madame, they're all broken.

19
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:00,418
I'll see what I can do.

20
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:03,000
Thank you, Madame.
Thank you.

21
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:25,608
You've broken it.

22
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:28,041
Get his file.

23
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,025
I'm telling you, the passport is real.

24
00:03:43,225 --> 00:03:46,583
So when you're ready to apply
for the visa you can come.

25
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:48,333
Thank you.

26
00:04:53,432 --> 00:04:56,458
Tighter, tighter.
Yeah, that's right.

27
00:04:57,892 --> 00:04:58,984
Here, give me.

28
00:04:59,184 --> 00:05:01,341
Uncle. They broke my paddle.

29
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,440
- Again?
- Yes.

30
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,083
- Alright, leave it upstairs.
- Okay.

31
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,625
You want to turn it on?

32
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,958
- Hello, mommy.
- How are you?

33
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:35,475
Did you get it?

34
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:53,023
It's just the visa left.

35
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:55,900
I'll transfer the money
to your account tomorrow.

36
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,157
Thank you.

37
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,333
- C'mon! I'm still looking at it.
- Give it back.

38
00:06:01,368 --> 00:06:04,666
You're going overseas.
I can't believe it.

39
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,833
Alright, I'm heading in.

40
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,966
- Money?
- Yes.

41
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,007
When they fight they get money.

42
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:20,916
Especially if they win a title.

43
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:23,339
How much?

44
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:25,108
Up to a million.

45
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:28,083
A million? Naira?

46
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:33,708
In a fight you can get up to one million.

47
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,984
Don't forget to buy "Assurance".

48
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:39,148
Which season?

49
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:40,648
Nine.

50
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:43,083
Will that show ever end?

51
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,226
What about you boys?

52
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:53,174
But he still beat Shawn Michaels.

53
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:56,495
- Answer your uncle.
- I already know what you want.

54
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:59,000
Celestine?

55
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:03,416
Your uncle is talking to you, Celestine.

56
00:07:07,532 --> 00:07:09,458
Bring your paddle.

57
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:24,083
My spoon is not a screwdriver!

58
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,867
Goddey! Goddey!

59
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:48,091
I don't know what these kids
have done with my TV.

60
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,384
I just want to come home
and watch my show.

61
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:55,750
I've told them not to touch my TV.

62
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:00,137
What are you doing?

63
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:06,568
Mofe, talk to me.

64
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:09,652
Oh! It's working now.

65
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,816
Thank you.

66
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:13,192
You see.

67
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:17,083
I don't want them touching my TV.

68
00:08:24,892 --> 00:08:28,300
They told her not to marry him!

69
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:34,143
She's in trouble now.

70
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,484
It looks real to me.

71
00:09:05,684 --> 00:09:07,900
Yeah, it's real.

72
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,166
What are you guys doing?

73
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:14,000
Let me see.

74
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,316
You? Sanchez?

75
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:24,733
Is that the name your parents gave you?

76
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:27,108
It's my foreign name.

77
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:29,850
Your foreign name?

78
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,842
Alright, get back to your posts.

79
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:36,760
Sanchez...

80
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,833
Good morning.

81
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,208
Good morning.

82
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:43,341
I don't know why you guys
are wasting fuel...

83
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,468
like I have the money.

84
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:01,452
Goddey!

85
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,708
Give me the Oju Adewale file.

86
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:28,331
Mofe?

87
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,616
The mortuary guys are here.

88
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:39,484
- Morgue!
- Sir.

89
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:41,014
Come, come, come.

90
00:14:04,392 --> 00:14:06,299
When can I take the bodies?

91
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:09,208
As soon as we receive the discharge fee.

92
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,014
What do you mean?

93
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:16,008
Discharge fee. See it here.

94
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,843
What if he can't pay?

95
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:23,931
We'll dispose of them.

96
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:26,458
What are you saying?

97
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,792
It's not right.

98
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:32,816
- Sir, please.
- Is next week okay?

99
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:37,166
You can pay whenever you want.
Just know that it is 3,000 per day.

100
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:42,183
- What sort of cruelty is this?
- Abu, it's okay.

101
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,123
Mofe, it's not okay.
It's not right.

102
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,440
Look, Madam, if it were your own kids,
would you stand for it?

103
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,400
Sir, please, I don't like how
you're talking to me.

104
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,024
Mind how you're talking to me.

105
00:14:56,224 --> 00:14:58,940
- Why did you touch me?
- Abu, leave it.

106
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,208
Are you okay?

107
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:23,487
Hello, Aunty.

108
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,945
Fine, thank you.

109
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,120
Is Dad with you?

110
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,562
Good evening, Dad.

111
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,454
I'm fine.

112
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:47,064
Dad, I'm calling because...

113
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:52,143
I'm calling because Precious...

114
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,568
Dad...

115
00:15:57,768 --> 00:15:59,739
Precious is dead.

116
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:04,043
And the children.

117
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:06,993
Accident.

118
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:09,510
No, in the house.

119
00:16:11,224 --> 00:16:15,368
I don't know, something to do
with the generator.

120
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,377
I don't know.

121
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,631
Yes.

122
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,341
I'm bringing them home next week.

123
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:28,152
I said next week.

124
00:16:29,184 --> 00:16:30,804
Yes.

125
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:36,177
Bye.

126
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:15,491
- This is Wisdom.
- Wisdom.

127
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:23,920
This is Wisdom.

128
00:17:27,932 --> 00:17:31,029
This is the new electrician, Wisdom.

129
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:40,300
Don't touch these machines.

130
00:17:41,257 --> 00:17:45,712
They need to be repaired.
Very dangerous.

131
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:51,620
You see?
So this is what we're running.

132
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,518
This is for the roller.

133
00:17:57,718 --> 00:18:00,291
See how it's connected to the main cable?

134
00:18:00,908 --> 00:18:03,860
When the roller comes,
you won't fix it.

135
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:08,000
If the machine spoils,
cut the wire here.

136
00:18:10,866 --> 00:18:14,000
And connect it here.

137
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,479
You understand?

138
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:21,666
Okay. Show me.

139
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:28,375
Not that one.

140
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,345
Yes, that's good, that's it.

141
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:52,522
- Blessing will bring your drink in a second.
- Thank you, Aunty.

142
00:20:52,848 --> 00:20:55,731
You know he came at the top of his class.

143
00:20:56,308 --> 00:20:58,048
Well done.

144
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,756
And he's going to university next year.

145
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:03,640
Well done.

146
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:14,680
So Dad,
I'm going to Okpara's tomorrow.

147
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:18,455
Is that where they are?

148
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,339
Yes.

149
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:23,432
- And you're going there tomorrow?
- Yes.

150
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:26,380
Alright, alright.

151
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:32,098
Is there anything you want to contribute?

152
00:21:33,268 --> 00:21:35,544
Was she not my daughter?

153
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:38,964
Anyone home?

154
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,832
- Ah, Clarence!
- Welcome.

155
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:43,740
Good afternoon.

156
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,291
Hello.

157
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,666
Have a seat.

158
00:21:55,224 --> 00:21:58,267
Clarence, this is my son.

159
00:22:01,515 --> 00:22:02,483
Mofe.

160
00:22:02,683 --> 00:22:06,099
Yeah, Mofe!
How are you?

161
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,041
It's been a while.

162
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:15,246
I'm Uncle Peter's son.

163
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:18,050
Peter Anabohri.

164
00:22:20,724 --> 00:22:23,436
I was little then.

165
00:22:26,855 --> 00:22:28,850
He's a lawyer.

166
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:35,823
I should be going.

167
00:22:36,348 --> 00:22:38,692
- Hold on, let me pack your food.
- No, it's okay, Aunty.

168
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:42,317
- It won't take long.
- Leave him.

169
00:22:42,517 --> 00:22:46,333
- What about your drink?
- He's in a hurry. I'll have it.

170
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,166
- Goodbye.
- Mofe, take it easy.

171
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:51,541
Bye-bye.

172
00:22:53,724 --> 00:22:55,330
Clarence, Clarence.

173
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,882
- Clarence, Clarito.
- Don't you start.

174
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:09,188
If you choose this one,
we can give you a band.

175
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:11,880
But you'll have to tip them.

176
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,346
What about coffins?

177
00:23:16,684 --> 00:23:20,111
We sell those ones.
Come, let me show you.

178
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,317
- Oh, no, it's too expensive.
- Too expensive?

179
00:23:34,808 --> 00:23:37,568
If you want,
you can give us the money,

180
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:41,083
we can arrange the materials
and make something cheaper.

181
00:23:42,808 --> 00:23:46,586
- How much are the materials?
- It depends.

182
00:23:49,057 --> 00:23:53,638
Ebony, 12,000 Naira,
but that's because it's scarce.

183
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,484
Mahogany, 5,000.

184
00:23:56,684 --> 00:23:59,657
And then regular materials,
1,000 Naira.

185
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,848
Listen, listen.

186
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:07,969
The way we leave this world
is very important.

187
00:24:08,224 --> 00:24:09,275
Very, very important.

188
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:10,524
If you're burying someone,

189
00:24:10,724 --> 00:24:13,484
it's good to show people
that they were loved.

190
00:24:13,684 --> 00:24:16,569
That the lives they lived mattered.

191
00:24:19,184 --> 00:24:22,791
- The deposit is 18,000?
- Yeah.

192
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:27,247
Give us a minute.

193
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,996
Dad? Dad?

194
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:34,432
Yes.

195
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,448
It's too much.

196
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,373
Dad, we discussed this yesterday.

197
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,065
These are your children,
your grandchildren.

198
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:46,586
I asked yesterday, and you said fine.

199
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,930
So you don't have anything?

200
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:02,608
Hold this. Here's 13,000.

201
00:25:08,932 --> 00:25:10,400
Thank you.

202
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,445
You know, this is just the deposit.

203
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:18,765
- Good work. Good work.
- Thank you.

204
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:29,291
Thank you, ma. Welcome.

205
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:32,791
- Eat here or take away?
- Take away.

206
00:25:39,626 --> 00:25:42,083
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

207
00:25:43,184 --> 00:25:45,416
It's in God's hands.

208
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:29,948
Mr. Vincent.

209
00:26:32,016 --> 00:26:33,758
You want tea?

210
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:36,875
Let me get you water.

211
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,000
Thank you.

212
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:55,805
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you, sir.

213
00:26:57,476 --> 00:27:00,144
- Generator?
- Yes, sir.

214
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,416
Jesus.

215
00:27:02,932 --> 00:27:04,708
We're finished.

216
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,951
- Let me not disturb you.
- It's no problem.

217
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:17,458
No, I should be going.

218
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:25,653
Don't worry about next month's rent.

219
00:27:28,376 --> 00:27:29,692
Are you serious?

220
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,168
Seriously.
Take your time.

221
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:35,256
I know it's not easy.

222
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:38,416
And you people have always been good.

223
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:42,524
Thank you, sir, thank you.

224
00:27:42,724 --> 00:27:45,958
God will bless you, thank you.

225
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,166
<i>Engineer.
Come in, please. Engineer.</i>

226
00:28:00,174 --> 00:28:01,666
I read you.

227
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,708
<i>There's a problem with the cutting machine.</i>

228
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,458
What kind of problem?

229
00:28:12,184 --> 00:28:14,125
<i>It's not working.</i>

230
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,500
<i>Engineer, come in, please.</i>

231
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,000
Wait, let me try this side.

232
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:44,808
Are you okay?

233
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:49,432
Show me, show me, show me.

234
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:57,583
Alright, come over here.

235
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,833
Hold still.

236
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,250
Shouldn't I go to the hospital?

237
00:29:16,848 --> 00:29:19,000
You're a mechanic now.

238
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:26,291
- Hold it.
- Boss, wait. This thing is painful.

239
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:29,333
- Please.
- Hold still.

240
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,708
Hold this on top.

241
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:57,583
Thank you.

242
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:29,381
Here, here,
let me take your passport photo.

243
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:31,608
He knows where he's going.

244
00:30:31,808 --> 00:30:33,375
Get lost!

245
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,937
Harassing my client.

246
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:37,791
Don't mind them.

247
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,400
You're ready to apply for the visa?

248
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,708
Where's your letter of invitation?

249
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,375
Employment letter?

250
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:52,860
You need a letter of invitation,
letter of employment,

251
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,024
bank statements, six months,
and a medical report.

252
00:30:56,224 --> 00:30:58,860
Go to the hospital, tell your doctor
to get you a medical report.

253
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,402
So everything is going to cost you 50,000.

254
00:31:02,602 --> 00:31:05,568
You don't have a letter of invitation.
You don't have an employment letter.

255
00:31:05,768 --> 00:31:08,381
My guys will get these things for you.

256
00:31:08,581 --> 00:31:11,791
I'm the one doing the forms, right?
Cool.

257
00:31:12,182 --> 00:31:15,041
Text me details on WhatsApp.

258
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,541
WhatsApp?

259
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:21,440
Okay.
I'll call you in three or four days' time.

260
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,222
You come back and if I need anything from you,
you'll bring it.

261
00:31:24,422 --> 00:31:26,333
It's easier this way, right?

262
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,333
Great, no worries.

263
00:31:39,684 --> 00:31:41,666
Are you Goddey?

264
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,316
No.

265
00:31:43,516 --> 00:31:46,224
Because that's the only other name
on the account, sir.

266
00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:48,576
Can I see the balance?

267
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:52,333
No, sir, it's for account holders only.

268
00:31:57,019 --> 00:32:00,708
- Is Goddey the husband?
- No, it's her son.

269
00:32:00,908 --> 00:32:04,083
- Oh, okay. How old is he?
- He's passed.

270
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:08,416
- I'm sorry for your loss, sir.
- It's okay.

271
00:32:12,308 --> 00:32:15,812
- Are you the only living relative?
- Yes.

272
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:17,608
Hold on.

273
00:32:17,808 --> 00:32:21,916
Bisi, do we have any probate forms?

274
00:32:49,308 --> 00:32:50,940
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting,

275
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,166
we're still trying to move into
our new building.

276
00:32:57,215 --> 00:32:59,541
Alright, so what can I do for you?

277
00:33:10,348 --> 00:33:13,589
- Do you know how much is in the account?
- No, sir.

278
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:18,692
Alright.

279
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:25,791
I'm going to send you to my man...
Bonaventure.

280
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:33,589
Tell him that you're from Emeka's law office,
and you'll be needing an affidavit.

281
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:40,793
Now, when you get the affidavit,
you'll need to place notices

282
00:33:40,993 --> 00:33:43,575
in two national newspapers,
announcing her death

283
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:45,729
and asking for people
who believe they have a claim

284
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:48,541
on her property to step forward.

285
00:34:00,516 --> 00:34:02,458
One more thing...

286
00:34:04,724 --> 00:34:07,583
I need you to fill this out.

287
00:34:08,941 --> 00:34:10,524
It's a client form.

288
00:34:10,724 --> 00:34:13,666
Don't worry, it's a formality.

289
00:34:19,862 --> 00:34:22,922
My fee is normally

290
00:34:23,122 --> 00:34:26,082
10,000 Naira plus ten percent
of whatever is recovered,

291
00:34:26,282 --> 00:34:31,000
but since you're from Mr. Vincent,
it's 6,000 Naira plus ten percent.

292
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:36,375
How long will it take?

293
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:41,083
Everything shouldn't be more
than a few weeks.

294
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:45,208
Is 2,000 okay for now?

295
00:34:56,025 --> 00:34:58,633
Put the last one here
then turn on the switch.

296
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,640
- This one?
- Yeah.

297
00:35:11,681 --> 00:35:14,291
- All of them?
- All of them.

298
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,648
Did it shock you?

299
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,666
No, I'm dancing.

300
00:35:45,348 --> 00:35:46,629
Sorry.

301
00:35:47,023 --> 00:35:48,375
It's okay.

302
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:54,333
Yes?

303
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,660
- Good evening, Ma'am.
- Good evening.

304
00:36:04,724 --> 00:36:06,833
Did you come to watch me pack?

305
00:36:07,476 --> 00:36:09,166
No, Ma'am.

306
00:36:11,184 --> 00:36:13,908
The junction boxes haven't arrived.

307
00:36:15,308 --> 00:36:17,000
I've placed the order.

308
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:19,568
It will get here when it gets here.

309
00:36:20,226 --> 00:36:22,648
Can you see what is causing the delay?

310
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:26,808
Engineer, I already told you,
it will get here soon.

311
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:31,252
The machines will spoil.

312
00:36:32,348 --> 00:36:35,972
Okay, I'll check it tomorrow.

313
00:36:36,974 --> 00:36:38,791
Good night.

314
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,718
Hey, Mofe!

315
00:37:17,348 --> 00:37:18,316
How've you been?

316
00:37:18,516 --> 00:37:20,291
Afternoon, sir.

317
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:27,440
Mr. Clarence is representing your father
in this matter.

318
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,705
My father?

319
00:37:28,905 --> 00:37:32,912
Didn't you place the notices
for the next of kin?

320
00:37:33,411 --> 00:37:34,568
Look, Mofe...

321
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:38,195
your father has made legal claims
on your sister's estate.

322
00:37:38,395 --> 00:37:40,816
- Now the truth is that...
- Who told him?

323
00:37:41,016 --> 00:37:42,500
I did.

324
00:37:44,006 --> 00:37:45,791
Look, Mofe...

325
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,875
The law...

326
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,083
is very clear about this.
Your sister died intestate.

327
00:37:54,531 --> 00:37:58,984
Legally, her property is to be shared
among family.

328
00:37:59,184 --> 00:38:03,833
Considering you're not a parent or child...

329
00:38:04,976 --> 00:38:07,083
you must wait.

330
00:38:07,976 --> 00:38:11,250
Look, your father is not a greedy man.

331
00:38:12,227 --> 00:38:14,568
He's willing to let you have
up to twenty percent

332
00:38:14,768 --> 00:38:17,068
which is very kind, you know?

333
00:38:17,268 --> 00:38:19,440
Because legally his claim...

334
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,166
I will die before he touches that money!

335
00:39:11,465 --> 00:39:13,958
<i>Come in, Engineer, please come in.</i>

336
00:39:17,184 --> 00:39:18,943
I read you, Ma'am.

337
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:23,166
<i>What's happening over there?
Why is everything still down?</i>

338
00:39:23,684 --> 00:39:25,875
We are working on it, Ma'am.

339
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,943
<i>Engineer, come in, please come in.</i>

340
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:34,384
I read you, Ma'am.

341
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:37,216
<i>What does that mean,
you're working on it?</i>

342
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,906
Ma'am, we are working on it.
We need a few minutes.

343
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:44,250
<i>Hurry up, please, we're behind.</i>

344
00:39:57,432 --> 00:39:58,875
Are you okay?

345
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:12,625
It's okay.
Calm down.

346
00:40:21,582 --> 00:40:23,250
Are you crazy?

347
00:40:24,892 --> 00:40:26,416
Engineer?

348
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,833
You sure you're not crazy?

349
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:34,041
Engineer, I'm talking to you!

350
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:40,940
I can't believe what you did.
You're going to have to pay for this.

351
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,732
Everything you're costing us,
you will pay.

352
00:40:43,932 --> 00:40:45,625
Every Naira!

353
00:40:48,016 --> 00:40:50,166
How can you do this? God!

354
00:40:53,724 --> 00:40:56,833
You have nothing to say for yourself,
right?

355
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,125
Get out.

356
00:41:02,432 --> 00:41:03,833
Get out!

357
00:41:05,016 --> 00:41:06,375
Now!

358
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:17,631
Thank you.

359
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:19,223
Um...

360
00:41:19,848 --> 00:41:22,666
Madam said I should collect your ID card.

361
00:41:40,115 --> 00:41:41,991
Boss, you're traveling?

362
00:41:42,191 --> 00:41:44,708
Please, please, I don't know.

363
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,522
Good night.

364
00:41:51,948 --> 00:41:53,458
Good night.

365
00:44:04,565 --> 00:44:07,416
- Maybe it's the fuel?
- The fuel?

366
00:44:07,975 --> 00:44:10,276
Yes, you know most of the fuel
we have here is dirty.

367
00:44:10,476 --> 00:44:14,125
- What do you mean?
- I mean the quality is bad.

368
00:44:16,391 --> 00:44:18,807
But wouldn't it show in the engine?

369
00:44:19,007 --> 00:44:21,692
Not always.
Most times you won't see it.

370
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:23,916
You won't see a thing at all.

371
00:44:37,684 --> 00:44:39,333
You want to eat?

372
00:44:40,641 --> 00:44:43,416
Hell, yeah. Sure thing, man.

373
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,458
- I don't play when it comes to food.
- Well, in that case, you're paying.

374
00:44:49,198 --> 00:44:50,816
No problem.

375
00:44:51,016 --> 00:44:52,258
Should I leave this here?

376
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:53,958
Leave it.

377
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:05,125
<i>If I don't vote and you don't vote,
how will we choose our leaders?</i>

378
00:45:11,808 --> 00:45:17,061
<i>Anybody able to lead us
to a better Nigeria</i>

379
00:45:17,261 --> 00:45:19,833
<i>is the best candidate.</i>

380
00:45:54,932 --> 00:45:56,647
Hello, Aunty.

381
00:45:57,898 --> 00:45:59,897
Is Dad there?

382
00:46:33,009 --> 00:46:36,506
Someone's been waiting for you
to get their hair washed, be quick.

383
00:46:38,364 --> 00:46:40,297
Don't block the mirror.

384
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:51,079
Be quick, be quick,
she's been waiting all day.

385
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,776
- Afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Aunty.

386
00:47:37,976 --> 00:47:40,681
- How are you?
- Fine.

387
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,666
Did you do your passport?

388
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:52,984
Grace.

389
00:47:53,184 --> 00:47:54,389
Passport?

390
00:47:55,184 --> 00:47:56,647
No.

391
00:47:58,043 --> 00:48:00,060
What about your medicine?

392
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,458
- Your medicine?
- Yeah.

393
00:48:41,425 --> 00:48:45,083
Long Island ice tea, with ice as well?

394
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,500
I know this man, Agbim!

395
00:49:06,308 --> 00:49:08,000
Stingy Agbim!

396
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,875
Angela!

397
00:49:11,924 --> 00:49:15,916
- But I know this man, he's nice.
- You see, he's nice.

398
00:49:16,897 --> 00:49:19,776
Forget about him, he's so cheap.

399
00:49:19,976 --> 00:49:23,458
Please, I'm sweating... where is Mercy?

400
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:29,984
Hey, so she said there's this new place
in V.I. we should try.

401
00:49:30,184 --> 00:49:32,375
- Tonight?
- Why not?

402
00:49:33,241 --> 00:49:36,558
Babe, I'm tired, I'm gonna go home.

403
00:49:37,114 --> 00:49:39,173
- See you later.
- Alright, darling.

404
00:49:39,373 --> 00:49:41,248
- Rosa.
- Bye.

405
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:43,250
Get home safe.

406
00:49:54,107 --> 00:49:56,708
Babe, could you drop me at CMS?

407
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,083
You didn't go to school today?

408
00:50:26,768 --> 00:50:28,708
I wasn't feeling too well.

409
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,791
What about your passport?

410
00:50:32,476 --> 00:50:33,941
Grace?

411
00:50:34,858 --> 00:50:36,758
I didn't have time.

412
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:40,024
So what are you doing now?
I'm sure they're still open.

413
00:50:40,224 --> 00:50:42,166
I still don't feel well.
I'll do it tomorrow.

414
00:50:42,366 --> 00:50:44,208
Do it today.

415
00:50:49,664 --> 00:50:51,500
Here. Take.

416
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:56,512
Well, get up.

417
00:51:43,592 --> 00:51:47,125
- I've been calling you.
- I've been busy.

418
00:51:47,435 --> 00:51:49,732
But all week you haven't been
taking my calls.

419
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:51,875
Mr. Vincent, what do you want?

420
00:51:53,384 --> 00:51:56,708
Nothing, nothing.
I was just worried.

421
00:51:58,424 --> 00:52:02,380
- Are you angry?
- No. No, I'm not angry.

422
00:52:04,915 --> 00:52:07,208
I'm sorry, please.

423
00:52:09,348 --> 00:52:13,331
Have you fixed your light?
I brought you some bulbs.

424
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:17,397
Thank you.

425
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:20,666
Come on, let me fix it for you.

426
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,940
I haven't heard from you in a while.

427
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:37,341
Mr. Vincent, please,
I've got too much on my mind.

428
00:52:39,107 --> 00:52:43,131
- What is wrong?
- Don't worry about it, it's not your problem.

429
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,425
Am I not here?
Please, talk to me.

430
00:52:48,684 --> 00:52:50,648
- I need money.
- For what?

431
00:52:50,848 --> 00:52:54,416
- Mr. Vincent, I said don't worry.
- No, wait, wait.

432
00:52:56,224 --> 00:52:57,666
How much?

433
00:53:02,715 --> 00:53:04,849
What if I ask you not to pay
this month's rent?

434
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:06,166
No!

435
00:53:07,092 --> 00:53:09,791
What if I ask you to pay half?

436
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:17,400
Mr. Vincent, no, thank you.

437
00:53:18,425 --> 00:53:20,885
You have to choose one.

438
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,331
I'm only trying to help.

439
00:53:30,151 --> 00:53:33,614
If I agree, the condition is
that I'll pay you back next month.

440
00:53:35,102 --> 00:53:36,750
Okay.

441
00:53:39,308 --> 00:53:43,010
See, what I want is for us
to trust each other.

442
00:53:44,348 --> 00:53:48,125
You need any help, ask me.
And if I can, definitely I will.

443
00:54:15,976 --> 00:54:18,900
- What are you doing?
- They were closed.

444
00:54:36,268 --> 00:54:38,097
Why are you like this?

445
00:54:39,224 --> 00:54:43,024
Huh? I ask you to do something
and you can't even do it.

446
00:54:43,224 --> 00:54:47,124
- But I told you they were closed and you said...
- You've had the entire week!

447
00:54:47,476 --> 00:54:49,625
And what about school?

448
00:54:55,449 --> 00:54:58,791
You'd better start behaving yourself
or I'll send you back.

449
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:06,375
Are you hearing me?

450
00:55:17,768 --> 00:55:21,112
Afternoon. We came for a check-up.

451
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:26,916
What if he can't pay?

452
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,833
We'll dispose of them.

453
00:55:34,348 --> 00:55:38,254
Grace, your folate levels are low.
I'm concerned.

454
00:55:38,516 --> 00:55:40,772
Have you been taking your medicine?

455
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:48,691
I can't stress how important it is
for you to take your medicine.

456
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:52,075
You're risking the health of your baby
if you don't.

457
00:56:00,808 --> 00:56:02,589
What's going on?

458
00:56:04,251 --> 00:56:05,973
Grace?

459
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:14,193
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I didn't mean it, OK?

460
00:56:15,007 --> 00:56:16,910
Grace, I said I'm sorry.

461
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:20,232
You need to start taking your medication.

462
00:56:20,432 --> 00:56:22,214
Promise you'll take them?

463
00:56:22,684 --> 00:56:25,189
Alright, gimme a smile.

464
00:56:28,308 --> 00:56:30,166
It's 5,000.

465
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,583
Card?

466
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,068
Take.

467
00:56:55,268 --> 00:56:57,064
Thank you.

468
00:57:10,016 --> 00:57:12,100
Hello, Mommy.

469
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,672
No, no, it's fine.
We're OK.

470
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,297
She's fine, you want to talk to her?

471
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:25,998
Hello?

472
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,058
Mommy?

473
00:57:33,432 --> 00:57:34,906
I'm fine.

474
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,089
School is fine.

475
00:57:41,016 --> 00:57:42,683
How is everybody?

476
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:48,477
Mom, Rosa wants her phone.
I'll call you back when I get credit.

477
00:57:51,326 --> 00:57:53,400
Hello, Mommy. I have to get going.

478
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,608
I'm late for work.

479
00:57:55,808 --> 00:57:58,000
Yes, Mom, take care.

480
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:24,648
- Hi.
- Hi.

481
00:58:24,848 --> 00:58:27,958
Sorry to disturb, I'm closing soon.
Can I get the bill?

482
00:58:28,895 --> 00:58:30,556
Yeah, sure.

483
00:58:31,432 --> 00:58:34,416
Actually, can I get one more whiskey?

484
00:58:42,104 --> 00:58:44,583
- Here.
- Thanks.

485
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:52,083
Here you go.

486
00:58:57,932 --> 00:59:00,208
- Current or savings?
- Current.

487
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:07,583
I'm still getting used to this.

488
00:59:12,817 --> 00:59:14,625
Are you from "Lahgos"?

489
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:16,458
What?

490
00:59:16,933 --> 00:59:18,333
Lagos.

491
00:59:19,224 --> 00:59:21,316
No, I'm from Abeokuta.

492
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:24,041
I'm not even going to try to say that.

493
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,808
- You're American.
- Yeah.

494
00:59:27,008 --> 00:59:28,241
But you look Lebanese.

495
00:59:28,441 --> 00:59:30,232
My parents are Lebanese.

496
00:59:30,432 --> 00:59:32,000
I thought so.

497
00:59:32,574 --> 00:59:34,067
We have a lot in Nigeria.

498
00:59:34,267 --> 00:59:35,732
I know.

499
00:59:35,932 --> 00:59:37,791
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

500
00:59:41,048 --> 00:59:43,125
- This is...
- Rosa.

501
00:59:47,932 --> 00:59:49,214
- Ready?
- Yeah.

502
00:59:49,414 --> 00:59:51,348
- Let's go.
- Oh, wait.

503
00:59:51,892 --> 00:59:55,708
So sorry, I forgot to tip.

504
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:57,958
Thank you.

505
01:00:00,395 --> 01:00:03,509
So, you're getting off soon right?

506
01:00:03,709 --> 01:00:04,793
Yes.

507
01:00:05,284 --> 01:00:07,648
You want to hang out
with me and my friends?

508
01:00:07,848 --> 01:00:09,625
No, it's fine.

509
01:00:09,932 --> 01:00:11,708
It's completely fine.

510
01:00:12,016 --> 01:00:14,083
She can hang, right?

511
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,250
It's okay, really.

512
01:00:16,684 --> 01:00:19,000
Really, it's fine.
Thank you though.

513
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:21,166
Alright...

514
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,276
If you want, I can give you my number.

515
01:00:25,476 --> 01:00:27,458
- Yeah?
- Why not.

516
01:01:00,397 --> 01:01:04,773
Hey, how are you?
Is your mom home?

517
01:01:08,843 --> 01:01:11,192
- Aunty Blessing is here.
- Who?

518
01:01:11,392 --> 01:01:13,943
- Blessing.
- Who is Aunty Blessing?

519
01:01:14,143 --> 01:01:19,375
Mercy, baby!
My baby girl for life!

520
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,964
- So good to see you! You look great!
- Aunty, I'm just managing.

521
01:01:24,164 --> 01:01:28,464
Shut up! What do you mean managing?
You look wonderful!

522
01:01:28,664 --> 01:01:30,625
These are my friends.

523
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,550
- Come in, come in, come in, come in.
- Thank you.

524
01:01:35,348 --> 01:01:37,583
- I like your dress.
- Thank you.

525
01:01:38,932 --> 01:01:43,333
Mercy, Mercy. Please, what can I get you?
Coke, Fanta?

526
01:01:43,848 --> 01:01:46,916
- Anything.
- Lucia!

527
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:49,958
Go and get some Cokes, my love.

528
01:01:51,483 --> 01:01:54,583
Make sure she doesn't break
my expensive glass.

529
01:01:56,948 --> 01:02:00,692
So you're the one that's pregnant?

530
01:02:00,892 --> 01:02:02,104
Yes.

531
01:02:03,874 --> 01:02:06,206
- How many months?
- Almost four.

532
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:13,232
- And the two of you want to go to Italy?
- Yes.

533
01:02:13,432 --> 01:02:16,600
That's good. I'm just coming back.
My husband is there.

534
01:02:17,432 --> 01:02:19,458
- Have you got papers?
- Yes.

535
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,500
- Lucia, go and play.
- Thank you.

536
01:02:39,306 --> 01:02:42,812
- Have you started prenatal?
- Yes.

537
01:02:43,883 --> 01:02:46,916
Next time you come,
bring her medical report.

538
01:02:51,858 --> 01:02:54,958
Okay, give me your number.

539
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,964
00...

540
01:02:58,164 --> 01:02:59,797
32...

541
01:02:59,997 --> 01:03:01,881
400...

542
01:03:02,081 --> 01:03:04,000
206.

543
01:03:06,684 --> 01:03:08,608
As soon as I get the visas,
I'll call you.

544
01:03:08,808 --> 01:03:11,416
I've been doing this a long time...

545
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:16,250
Mercy will tell you
I've been doing this a long time.

546
01:03:21,657 --> 01:03:24,333
He's American.
He went to school there.

547
01:03:27,268 --> 01:03:28,833
He's cute.

548
01:03:35,832 --> 01:03:39,125
- Does he have any friends?
- At your age!

549
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:27,776
- You know what your clothes look like?
- What?

550
01:04:27,976 --> 01:04:29,833
Death.

551
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:33,897
- They're not nice.
- What about yours?

552
01:04:34,097 --> 01:04:38,008
Grace, look at me,
learn from the best.

553
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,568
- Colour riot.
- It is not colour riot.

554
01:04:40,768 --> 01:04:43,090
And the nice ones aren't yours.

555
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:45,082
Can you wear your sister's dress?

556
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,541
Has she got more?

557
01:04:52,557 --> 01:04:54,833
Grace, Grace, see this one.

558
01:04:55,975 --> 01:05:00,833
- Do you want her to kill me?
- She won't do anything, try this dress.

559
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:06,108
Blue colour plus your brown eyes
gives you blue-brown.

560
01:05:06,308 --> 01:05:08,458
Take it from me, girl.

561
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:18,916
Turn.

562
01:05:24,993 --> 01:05:28,816
No, show your face.
Put your hand behind your hair.

563
01:05:29,016 --> 01:05:30,250
Yes.

564
01:05:33,323 --> 01:05:34,916
What's up?

565
01:05:35,931 --> 01:05:38,375
You guys doing a photo shoot?

566
01:05:39,914 --> 01:05:41,550
What's up, baby?

567
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,333
Can I join?

568
01:05:45,348 --> 01:05:47,208
How exactly?

569
01:05:47,408 --> 01:05:51,041
Take a picture of us on Snapchat.

570
01:05:52,476 --> 01:05:54,166
Grace.

571
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:59,791
Look how fine she is.

572
01:06:03,365 --> 01:06:04,613
That's enough.

573
01:06:05,432 --> 01:06:08,000
Take another one.

574
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:15,257
- Did you save it?
- Sure, pal.

575
01:06:15,457 --> 01:06:18,000
What's the rush?

576
01:06:18,348 --> 01:06:21,458
- I have somewhere to go to.
- Wait.

577
01:06:23,184 --> 01:06:24,464
Relax.

578
01:06:24,664 --> 01:06:28,250
Let me buy something
for you and your friend.

579
01:06:29,249 --> 01:06:32,583
Anything you want,
I'll get for both of you.

580
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,458
You want something to eat?

581
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:43,205
I cut her in on this deal I was working on,
nothing major just a little forex thing.

582
01:06:43,405 --> 01:06:48,458
She stood to make 10, maybe 15 US,
which isn't bad for a few months' work.

583
01:06:49,942 --> 01:06:55,033
So the meeting's set.
We're about to close, and she calls to cancel.

584
01:06:55,233 --> 01:06:56,735
You know what she says?

585
01:06:56,935 --> 01:07:00,682
I have to go and see my "Uncle".
He's the one who sponsored my education.

586
01:07:00,882 --> 01:07:02,565
You know what that means!

587
01:07:02,765 --> 01:07:06,422
You should've known that
before you brought her in.

588
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:09,422
- You should've seen the signs.
- There was nothing I could do.

589
01:07:09,622 --> 01:07:13,225
These people, you can show them
all the income statements you want.

590
01:07:13,425 --> 01:07:14,709
It doesn't make any difference.

591
01:07:14,909 --> 01:07:16,980
They're mostly interested
in working with someone...

592
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:20,000
who's willing to offer
a little extra on the side.

593
01:07:21,224 --> 01:07:24,708
Put her in a tight dress next time
you pitch and see what happens.

594
01:07:28,267 --> 01:07:32,732
Luckily, we were far enough along that we
managed to get it closed and move on.

595
01:07:32,932 --> 01:07:36,541
Last time though. I can tell you that
for free. Never again.

596
01:07:37,366 --> 01:07:40,000
Sounds to me like you
didn't have enough money.

597
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,250
15K is not that much money.

598
01:08:13,516 --> 01:08:16,833
You should take the first bite.
Let me know what you think.

599
01:08:20,889 --> 01:08:23,097
- And?
- What's this please?

600
01:08:23,297 --> 01:08:26,033
It's tofu.
You'd don't like it?

601
01:08:26,233 --> 01:08:30,625
No? How could you not like it.
It's so good. I love tofu.

602
01:08:32,516 --> 01:08:34,008
Can we please have a menu.

603
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:35,672
We're going to order something else
with this as well.

604
01:08:35,872 --> 01:08:37,922
- We don't need to order something else.
- It's fine.

605
01:08:38,122 --> 01:08:39,543
Just the menu.
Please.

606
01:08:39,743 --> 01:08:41,133
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

607
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:42,547
I can't believe you don't like this.

608
01:08:42,747 --> 01:08:44,422
- There's no pepper.
- No pepper?

609
01:08:44,622 --> 01:08:46,750
Yeah and it just tastes like grass.

610
01:08:48,563 --> 01:08:51,068
It's not grass.
It's broccoli, mushrooms, corn.

611
01:08:51,268 --> 01:08:52,625
Grass.

612
01:08:56,656 --> 01:08:58,988
- Is that a plantain?
- Yes.

613
01:09:01,184 --> 01:09:03,041
Look at this one.

614
01:09:20,101 --> 01:09:21,256
Good evening, sir.

615
01:09:21,456 --> 01:09:24,583
Good evening, how are you?

616
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:29,208
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

617
01:09:29,826 --> 01:09:32,339
- Are you going to eat that?
- No.

618
01:09:32,539 --> 01:09:34,791
I think our fridge is broken.

619
01:09:35,516 --> 01:09:37,708
- Can I see it?
- Yes.

620
01:09:51,308 --> 01:09:53,191
It's not cooling again.

621
01:09:53,391 --> 01:09:55,964
But my friend can fix it for you.

622
01:09:56,164 --> 01:09:58,684
- Yes, please.
- Alright.

623
01:10:01,763 --> 01:10:03,458
Let's help him.

624
01:11:07,371 --> 01:11:08,745
Good evening.

625
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:14,000
- You want to charge?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

626
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:26,416
That's our fridge.

627
01:11:27,476 --> 01:11:33,672
Oh, please. Sorry for the delay.
I'll work on it next.

628
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:36,250
It's fine, thank you.

629
01:11:39,101 --> 01:11:41,589
So are you going to fix everything here?

630
01:11:41,789 --> 01:11:42,833
Yes.

631
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,500
Did someone teach you?

632
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:49,333
I just understand it.

633
01:11:52,782 --> 01:11:55,418
- Should I turn on the sound?
- Can you?

634
01:11:55,618 --> 01:11:56,910
Of course!

635
01:12:11,642 --> 01:12:13,416
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

636
01:12:25,648 --> 01:12:26,989
Grace?

637
01:12:27,623 --> 01:12:28,939
Grace?

638
01:12:33,848 --> 01:12:35,166
How are you?

639
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:36,875
I'm fine.

640
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,541
You sure?

641
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,550
For me?

642
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:56,458
Wow, thank you so much.
Thank you.

643
01:13:02,025 --> 01:13:05,089
You're welcome.
Bring it, I'll keep it inside.

644
01:13:05,289 --> 01:13:06,773
Thank you.

645
01:13:06,973 --> 01:13:09,333
Oh, you're smiling now.

646
01:13:13,184 --> 01:13:14,759
We ate on the roof.

647
01:13:14,959 --> 01:13:15,840
I don't understand.

648
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:20,791
It was a restaurant, and I could see
the whole of Lagos from there.

649
01:13:21,289 --> 01:13:22,883
What about the mall?

650
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:26,339
What don't they have there?
Clothes, electronics, food.

651
01:13:26,539 --> 01:13:28,833
I wish you had seen it.

652
01:13:35,182 --> 01:13:36,875
Grace, go out.

653
01:13:38,336 --> 01:13:39,217
Good afternoon, sir.

654
01:13:39,417 --> 01:13:41,416
- How are you?
- Fine.

655
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:53,214
- Have I not been taking care of you?
- You have.

656
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:58,989
So why are you disgracing me like this?

657
01:13:59,189 --> 01:14:01,291
How am I disgracing you?

658
01:14:02,118 --> 01:14:07,541
Rosa, take your time.
Take your time, I'm not a fool.

659
01:14:12,166 --> 01:14:13,790
Why can't you love me?

660
01:14:14,657 --> 01:14:18,849
What's wrong with you? Stop now!
What's all this?

661
01:14:19,049 --> 01:14:22,458
So now you have somebody else
and you don't want me again, right?

662
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:29,125
Okay, no problem,
let him take care of you.

663
01:14:30,991 --> 01:14:34,916
But I don't want you to call me again
for anything, understand?

664
01:14:35,448 --> 01:14:37,488
Don't. Call. Me!

665
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:19,584
It's so tall.

666
01:15:19,784 --> 01:15:24,226
It's similar to the building I told you about,
where I'll be visiting.

667
01:15:24,426 --> 01:15:27,625
Have a look.
This is it here.

668
01:15:28,415 --> 01:15:32,500
I know it's great, right?
I can't wait.

669
01:15:34,598 --> 01:15:36,166
When are you going back?

670
01:15:37,243 --> 01:15:42,617
I don't know. I need another 10,000
before I can apply for the visa.

671
01:15:42,817 --> 01:15:44,148
Naira?

672
01:15:44,348 --> 01:15:47,859
No, dollars. U.S. dollars.

673
01:15:48,059 --> 01:15:52,458
The money has to be in your account
before they'll agree.

674
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:58,833
I was hoping I could get the money here,
but man, these guys aren't fools.

675
01:16:01,607 --> 01:16:04,583
- Is it Seyi?
- Hell no!

676
01:16:06,256 --> 01:16:09,732
No, I don't play with people like that.

677
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:13,769
He'll be looking at you like you're nobody,
but he'll still be looking at you.

678
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:16,506
I thought I was the only one
that felt that way.

679
01:16:16,706 --> 01:16:19,791
If you make the mistake
of letting him sleep with you,

680
01:16:20,268 --> 01:16:22,422
you're on your own.

681
01:16:22,622 --> 01:16:25,422
My father is in the hospital,

682
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:29,316
and they won't treat
him until they get paid.

683
01:16:29,516 --> 01:16:32,000
Maybe you can help?

684
01:16:33,249 --> 01:16:35,166
You guys got it all wrong.

685
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:37,816
Yeah, we got it all wrong.

686
01:16:38,016 --> 01:16:40,908
Just because she calls you daddy
doesn't mean she's your daughter.

687
01:16:41,108 --> 01:16:45,000
I officially hate you.
We're done. We're done.

688
01:16:48,643 --> 01:16:51,524
Has she asked you if you
can help pay her tuition

689
01:16:51,724 --> 01:16:54,783
before she's kicked out of college?

690
01:16:54,983 --> 01:16:56,808
Or her brother's application fee?

691
01:16:57,008 --> 01:17:02,964
The best is when they say that they need
money to maintain themselves for you.

692
01:17:03,164 --> 01:17:07,589
What's wrong with getting maintained?
This... all of this doesn't just happen.

693
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,506
There are levels.

694
01:17:09,706 --> 01:17:12,500
You and her are not the same.

695
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:20,589
I can't believe
we are having this conversation.

696
01:17:20,789 --> 01:17:23,868
Has she said,
"Please, could you buy me a smartphone

697
01:17:24,068 --> 01:17:26,541
so I can send you better pictures?"

698
01:17:29,016 --> 01:17:31,791
- No, you did not!
- Oh my God!

699
01:17:33,807 --> 01:17:35,958
It wasn't an iPhone or anything.

700
01:17:39,133 --> 01:17:42,735
I get here. It takes me forever
to get my luggage...

701
01:17:42,935 --> 01:17:45,118
because everybody just like swarms...

702
01:17:45,318 --> 01:17:47,823
People like shove each other
out of the way here to grab things.

703
01:17:48,023 --> 01:17:50,267
- Welcome to Lagos.
- I noticed it yesterday in one of the cabs.

704
01:17:50,467 --> 01:17:54,047
This lady just like shoved this man
out of the way to jump into a cab.

705
01:17:54,247 --> 01:17:55,708
And...

706
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,250
That's how they push
people around in Lagos.

707
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:12,651
Anyway, so I grab my luggage,
and I'm on my way towards the exit.

708
01:18:12,851 --> 01:18:17,276
And there's like these tables set up
with these army looking guys, right?

709
01:18:17,476 --> 01:18:19,195
I guess they're your Customs people.

710
01:18:19,395 --> 01:18:21,903
- If you guys have Customs...
- We have Customs in Nigeria.

711
01:18:22,103 --> 01:18:23,699
Now? You didn't have them before?

712
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:26,125
We've always had Customs.

713
01:18:27,311 --> 01:18:29,400
Doesn't every country?

714
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,964
I don't know.
Things seem different here.

715
01:18:32,164 --> 01:18:35,675
So the guy is missing an eye,
and he points me out...

716
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:37,148
Sorry.

717
01:18:45,059 --> 01:18:46,440
Why don't you just pick up the phone?

718
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,000
Don't worry about it.

719
01:18:49,184 --> 01:18:50,487
So the Customs person...

720
01:18:50,687 --> 01:18:54,524
The guy that was at the table.
He points me out and goes, "You!"

721
01:18:54,724 --> 01:18:59,458
I go to him, and he doesn't look in my bag.
He just asks me what's in the bag.

722
01:18:59,658 --> 01:19:00,695
You didn't open it for him?

723
01:19:00,895 --> 01:19:02,984
He didn't open bag.
He just asked me what was in there.

724
01:19:03,184 --> 01:19:06,731
I was like, it's just clothes,
and my camera was in there and some...

725
01:19:06,931 --> 01:19:08,826
you know, toothpaste or whatever.

726
01:19:09,026 --> 01:19:11,820
And he goes, "What did you bring for me?"

727
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:12,916
What?

728
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:17,250
I was like, "What did I bring for you?"
I don't...

729
01:19:21,432 --> 01:19:23,458
Sorry. Let me just...

730
01:19:24,723 --> 01:19:25,891
Hello.

731
01:19:26,633 --> 01:19:27,757
Yes.

732
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:38,375
Mr. Vincent, what do you want?

733
01:19:39,081 --> 01:19:41,666
Why are you calling me,
I don't understand.

734
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:47,523
No, I'm not at home,
I'm at my aunty's house.

735
01:19:52,589 --> 01:19:56,166
I'm not angry.
No, I'm not.

736
01:19:59,307 --> 01:20:03,847
When I come back.
Mr. Vincent, when I come back.

737
01:20:05,004 --> 01:20:06,375
Bye bye.

738
01:20:26,509 --> 01:20:29,541
Sorry about that.
It was my sister.

739
01:20:31,516 --> 01:20:32,949
Everything alright?

740
01:20:33,149 --> 01:20:34,541
Yes.

741
01:20:42,517 --> 01:20:43,958
So...

742
01:20:44,558 --> 01:20:47,541
What happened to the phone
that I bought you?

743
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,000
I gave it to my sister.

744
01:20:51,848 --> 01:20:53,541
I hope you're not annoyed?

745
01:20:53,964 --> 01:20:55,632
No, I just...

746
01:20:57,422 --> 01:21:01,135
- Was it for her from the get-go?
- Yes.

747
01:21:01,335 --> 01:21:04,500
Why didn't you just tell me
it was for her from the beginning?

748
01:21:05,724 --> 01:21:09,583
Because I didn't want you thinking
that maybe I was just using you.

749
01:21:15,516 --> 01:21:16,881
It's fine. It's fine.

750
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:20,458
I think it's actually really nice
that you did that for her.

751
01:21:21,504 --> 01:21:23,083
Thank you.

752
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,075
Can I ask a favour?

753
01:21:37,275 --> 01:21:38,541
Yeah, of course.

754
01:21:40,175 --> 01:21:42,616
I really need help with my rent.

755
01:21:46,673 --> 01:21:50,083
I swear I wouldn't you ask
if I had another option.

756
01:21:51,182 --> 01:21:53,791
I'm having issues with my landlord.

757
01:21:55,931 --> 01:21:57,291
Right...

758
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,900
- You know what, don't worry.
- No, it's fine.

759
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:06,583
I'm sorry, I was just...
My mind went somewhere else.

760
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,521
Your rent? Just your rent?

761
01:22:10,721 --> 01:22:12,620
- Just my rent.
- Okay.

762
01:22:13,153 --> 01:22:14,866
It's because of my landlord,
I don't want...

763
01:22:15,066 --> 01:22:18,791
I get it. I understand.
I know it's hard.

764
01:22:20,432 --> 01:22:23,416
Just let me know how much you need,
I'll take care of it.

765
01:22:24,016 --> 01:22:26,250
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

766
01:22:28,016 --> 01:22:30,833
- Thank you.
- No problem.

767
01:22:33,684 --> 01:22:36,416
I know it's rough.
It's all good.

768
01:22:36,976 --> 01:22:38,625
Thank you.

769
01:22:51,848 --> 01:22:54,289
How long did you say
you've been having these headaches?

770
01:22:54,489 --> 01:22:56,941
For a week.

771
01:22:59,138 --> 01:23:00,708
Okay...

772
01:23:01,348 --> 01:23:05,958
If it persists or gets worse,
come back immediately and see us.

773
01:23:06,263 --> 01:23:07,625
Okay.

774
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:11,458
But, Grace,
you really need to take it easy.

775
01:23:13,974 --> 01:23:15,708
Okay.

776
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:22,500
Do you want to know the sex
of the baby?

777
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:26,583
Yes.

778
01:23:26,976 --> 01:23:28,541
It's a girl.

779
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:55,994
- You're not changing your mind, right?
- No.

780
01:23:56,194 --> 01:23:58,250
Okay, now...

781
01:23:59,308 --> 01:24:02,760
You'll take an oath before
the baby is born.

782
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,833
But I want you to swear
that you'll give it to me.

783
01:24:08,683 --> 01:24:11,208
- The baby?
- Yes.

784
01:24:16,699 --> 01:24:18,833
- Okay.
- What?

785
01:24:22,476 --> 01:24:24,000
I swear.

786
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:39,208
Swear on this.

787
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:51,375
I swear I'll give you my baby.

788
01:25:09,066 --> 01:25:13,000
Now, don't touch that money.

789
01:25:13,693 --> 01:25:19,361
You'll put some hairs from your privates,
some blood and one passport picture inside.

790
01:25:22,398 --> 01:25:23,875
Now?

791
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:26,426
Not now.

792
01:25:26,626 --> 01:25:29,333
When you're at eight months,
we'll seal the oath.

793
01:25:30,031 --> 01:25:31,391
Take.

794
01:25:37,224 --> 01:25:39,250
Alright, get going.

795
01:25:41,844 --> 01:25:43,958
For transport.

796
01:25:48,041 --> 01:25:50,623
<i>Hi, I'm Peter.
Please leave a message.</i>

797
01:25:50,823 --> 01:25:53,385
Come here.
Where are you going?

798
01:25:53,585 --> 01:25:54,940
I want to undo some of my hair.

799
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:57,000
Is that how you greet?

800
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:01,000
So you don't know how to greet?

801
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,108
They didn't teach you
how to greet in your house?

802
01:26:03,308 --> 01:26:05,816
- Sorry, good afternoon.
- What did you come to do?

803
01:26:06,016 --> 01:26:07,574
I've come to loose my braids.

804
01:26:07,774 --> 01:26:09,541
Rosa!

805
01:26:17,824 --> 01:26:20,024
- You're finally ready to remove it?
- Yes.

806
01:26:20,224 --> 01:26:22,291
Yeah, the hair is tired.

807
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:42,375
Good afternoon.
Perfume? Body spray?

808
01:27:56,249 --> 01:27:59,541
Good afternoon. Perfume?
Body spray? Powder?

809
01:28:02,635 --> 01:28:05,333
Good afternoon. Perfume?
Body spray? Powder?

810
01:28:06,485 --> 01:28:08,450
- Do you like this one?
- How much is it?

811
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:10,166
2,000.

812
01:28:10,959 --> 01:28:13,307
- What's your last price?
- 2,000.

813
01:28:13,507 --> 01:28:15,715
2,000? No lower?

814
01:28:31,808 --> 01:28:34,541
- It declined.
- The card?

815
01:28:35,267 --> 01:28:37,208
Please, can you try again?

816
01:28:55,391 --> 01:28:57,041
It's going.

817
01:29:04,311 --> 01:29:06,400
Am I getting it?

818
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,769
Let me show you.

819
01:29:07,969 --> 01:29:09,333
Do like this...

820
01:29:15,841 --> 01:29:17,541
Tolu!

821
01:29:18,917 --> 01:29:20,291
Tolu!

822
01:29:25,811 --> 01:29:27,608
- Do you not have homework to do?
- I finished.

823
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:31,291
Then go sweep the floor.
Can't you see the house is dirty?

824
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:37,732
And you?

825
01:29:37,932 --> 01:29:40,297
Don't you think you should be lying down?

826
01:29:40,497 --> 01:29:41,916
Come.

827
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:18,958
Can anyone else attend to us, please?

828
01:30:20,657 --> 01:30:25,208
Onyinye! Onyinye!

829
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:28,000
Why are you shouting my name?

830
01:30:28,622 --> 01:30:31,875
Is there another doctor on duty?
Please, it's very urgent.

831
01:30:32,508 --> 01:30:33,557
What's wrong with her?

832
01:30:33,757 --> 01:30:35,916
My sister's bleeding from her privates.

833
01:30:37,499 --> 01:30:40,250
- Just come.
- Thank you.

834
01:30:43,166 --> 01:30:45,125
Thank you.

835
01:31:14,831 --> 01:31:17,232
Doctor, they said you want
to keep her overnight.

836
01:31:17,432 --> 01:31:19,609
Yes, so we can monitor her.

837
01:31:19,809 --> 01:31:22,358
She's okay,
but her blood pressure is high.

838
01:31:22,558 --> 01:31:26,583
I completely understand that,
but can I pay tomorrow?

839
01:31:28,982 --> 01:31:32,487
I've been coming here for a long time
and Dr Ojo normally attends to us.

840
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:34,543
She knows.
Everybody here knows...

841
01:31:34,743 --> 01:31:36,668
I don't ever delay on payments.

842
01:31:36,868 --> 01:31:38,291
It's true.

843
01:31:41,576 --> 01:31:43,833
You can be sure that I'll pay.

844
01:31:47,267 --> 01:31:50,474
- First thing tomorrow morning. Understand?
- Yes.

845
01:31:50,674 --> 01:31:52,666
First thing, or we remove her...

846
01:31:57,288 --> 01:32:00,297
Hello? I'm on the street,
I don't know...

847
01:32:00,497 --> 01:32:02,583
I've seen you.

848
01:32:15,441 --> 01:32:17,666
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

849
01:32:20,066 --> 01:32:22,694
- How are you?
- Fine.

850
01:32:23,686 --> 01:32:24,815
You called me.

851
01:32:25,015 --> 01:32:27,015
Mr. Vincent, please,
I need your help.

852
01:32:27,868 --> 01:32:29,967
- What'd you say?
- I need your help, please.

853
01:32:30,167 --> 01:32:33,797
You need my help?
Is that why you called me?

854
01:32:33,997 --> 01:32:36,695
- Please, mr. Vincent.
- Is that why you called me?

855
01:32:36,895 --> 01:32:39,433
Mr. Vincent, Grace is in the hospital.

856
01:32:39,633 --> 01:32:41,573
Please, I don't know what to do anymore.

857
01:32:41,773 --> 01:32:45,415
I beg you, in the name of God.
Please, I know I treated you badly. I'm sorry.

858
01:32:45,615 --> 01:32:48,738
Let me ask you, do you think I'm a fool?

859
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:50,518
That all you need from me is just help.

860
01:32:50,718 --> 01:32:52,547
When you need money,
that's when you come to me, right?

861
01:32:52,747 --> 01:32:55,216
Mr. Vincent,
I'm sorry for everything I did.

862
01:32:55,416 --> 01:32:57,716
I've tried everything.
I can't raise her hospital bills,

863
01:32:57,916 --> 01:33:00,225
and I don't want anything
to happen to her.

864
01:33:00,425 --> 01:33:03,232
So now you remember Mr. Vincent, the fool?

865
01:33:03,432 --> 01:33:06,797
The one you always get money from
and treat how you like?

866
01:33:06,997 --> 01:33:10,339
Like some piece of dirt on the street.

867
01:33:10,539 --> 01:33:12,166
I'm sorry.

868
01:33:13,513 --> 01:33:15,667
Mr. Vincent, please, for the sake of God...

869
01:33:15,867 --> 01:33:18,541
Don't do it for me, do it for Grace.

870
01:33:19,251 --> 01:33:22,176
Loan me the money, don't give it to me.
Loan it to me and I'll pay you back.

871
01:33:22,376 --> 01:33:25,797
Let me tell you something,
I can always help you...

872
01:33:25,997 --> 01:33:29,625
It's not about the money.
But when you start to treat me as though...

873
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,525
I'm nothing.

874
01:33:32,725 --> 01:33:34,934
Because you found somebody else,

875
01:33:35,134 --> 01:33:38,426
and then you started to treat me
however you like...

876
01:33:38,825 --> 01:33:40,933
Now you've come for help?

877
01:33:41,285 --> 01:33:42,800
I'm sorry.

878
01:33:46,466 --> 01:33:49,041
So Grace is in the hospital?

879
01:33:49,502 --> 01:33:50,916
Good morning.

880
01:33:56,001 --> 01:33:58,467
There's a problem.
It's supposed to be 30,000.

881
01:33:58,667 --> 01:34:01,321
- Oh, we had to give her blood.
- Blood?

882
01:34:01,521 --> 01:34:04,068
For what? Why?

883
01:34:04,268 --> 01:34:06,381
Where is my sister?
Can I see my sister?

884
01:34:06,581 --> 01:34:09,125
Calm down, let me call the doctor.

885
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:18,416
Doctor, why is Grace receiving blood?

886
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:23,400
I was here yesterday and she was fine.

887
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:28,860
Grace is fine. She's okay,
she lost some blood...

888
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:31,192
so we had to give her a transfusion.

889
01:34:31,392 --> 01:34:32,901
But she's better now.

890
01:34:33,101 --> 01:34:35,185
- She is okay?
- She is okay.

891
01:34:35,385 --> 01:34:37,948
- Can I see her?
- Not immediately, she's in recovery,

892
01:34:38,148 --> 01:34:41,208
but in a little while
you should be able to see her.

893
01:34:50,016 --> 01:34:52,393
Lucia, please be careful.

894
01:34:52,593 --> 01:34:54,166
Yes, mom.

895
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:03,708
Good afternoon.

896
01:35:16,923 --> 01:35:21,166
After all the time and money
I wasted on you two...

897
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:23,833
I'm sorry.

898
01:35:24,798 --> 01:35:28,339
It's not about sorry. We have a problem.
Sit down.

899
01:35:28,539 --> 01:35:29,875
Thank you.

900
01:35:36,415 --> 01:35:40,684
- So, do you still want to travel?
- Yes.

901
01:35:42,348 --> 01:35:44,640
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

902
01:35:45,184 --> 01:35:48,104
Good. Because I want you to travel.

903
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:52,360
You know I promised to take care of you,
and I like to keep my promises...

904
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,902
but our agreement was
I would have your sister's baby

905
01:35:55,102 --> 01:35:56,651
in exchange for transport over there.

906
01:35:56,851 --> 01:36:01,133
But as it is, no baby,
I've wasted so much money.

907
01:36:01,333 --> 01:36:03,200
I paid for your visas!

908
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:05,891
I need to know that, if you travel,
I will be paid back.

909
01:36:06,091 --> 01:36:08,964
- I can't.
- I know.

910
01:36:09,164 --> 01:36:12,208
You will work for me,
and I will take it out of your salary.

911
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:16,108
What about my sister?

912
01:36:16,308 --> 01:36:19,916
She will work, or do you want
to pay for her as well?

913
01:37:15,373 --> 01:37:17,791
Come in, come in.

914
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:22,142
What can I get you?

915
01:37:22,342 --> 01:37:24,375
Nothing, I'm fine. Thank you.

916
01:37:24,867 --> 01:37:28,464
I wish you called, I would have
arranged the whole place.

917
01:37:28,664 --> 01:37:30,716
- Sit down.
- It's okay.

918
01:37:30,916 --> 01:37:32,625
Mr. Vincent...

919
01:37:34,526 --> 01:37:38,208
If I marry you, you have to promise
to take care of my family.

920
01:37:45,064 --> 01:37:47,708
Grace has to go to a private school.

921
01:37:51,264 --> 01:37:54,625
And you'll open a shop for me
to sell clothes.

922
01:37:59,025 --> 01:38:01,833
And you'll really be my wife?

923
01:38:04,223 --> 01:38:10,375
You will love me, cook for me,
clean the house, all those things?

924
01:38:19,075 --> 01:38:20,541
Yes.

925
01:38:23,848 --> 01:38:25,625
Sit down.

926
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:38,375
I promise you, I will take care
of you and your family.

927
01:38:46,698 --> 01:38:49,291
So what can I get you?

928
01:38:49,992 --> 01:38:51,297
Nothing, I'm okay.

929
01:38:51,497 --> 01:38:55,750
No, you have to have something.
I'll get you something.

930
01:39:54,617 --> 01:39:55,866
Hi.

931
01:39:56,066 --> 01:39:59,250
- Let me know next time you go out.
- Okay.

932
01:40:01,065 --> 01:40:03,773
- What's this?
- Money.

933
01:40:03,973 --> 01:40:05,416
From where?

934
01:40:07,268 --> 01:40:09,166
I sold my phone.

935
01:41:24,375 --> 01:41:26,166
- That one.
- This one?

936
01:41:26,575 --> 01:41:28,467
But it's not going to be too big?

937
01:41:28,667 --> 01:41:31,875
The same size as this,
and make sure it's straight.

938
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:37,208
Don't worry,
I'm going to make you happy.

939
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:42,474
If it's not straight,
I'll go somewhere else.

940
01:41:42,674 --> 01:41:45,208
I'm going to make you happy,
don't worry.

941
01:41:45,808 --> 01:41:48,583
It's my work, it's my job.

942
01:41:54,435 --> 01:41:59,051
Engineer, welcome back.

943
01:41:59,251 --> 01:42:01,711
How are you?

944
01:42:02,733 --> 01:42:05,083
What about business?

945
01:42:09,384 --> 01:42:10,597
Where's Wisdom?

946
01:42:10,797 --> 01:42:13,750
Wisdom? At your house.

947
01:42:15,541 --> 01:42:17,456
Do you mind staying?
I'll be right back.

948
01:42:17,656 --> 01:42:22,208
- No problem, take your time.
- I'm coming back.

949
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:36,250
- Welcome.
- Good evening, sir.

950
01:42:38,659 --> 01:42:40,943
Let me get back to work.
Later, Aunty.

951
01:42:41,143 --> 01:42:42,400
Blessing, see you.

952
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:45,791
- Sorry, I'll be back.
- No problem, boss.

953
01:42:48,848 --> 01:42:51,916
- How's work?
- It's okay.

954
01:42:55,749 --> 01:42:57,291
Is that enough?

955
01:43:05,932 --> 01:43:07,708
This okay?

956
01:43:21,516 --> 01:43:22,958
How is it?

957
01:43:24,224 --> 01:43:27,625
- Good, right?
- Yeah, it's good.

958
01:43:44,101 --> 01:43:45,595
Well done.

959
01:43:46,184 --> 01:43:47,875
Thank you.

960
01:43:52,298 --> 01:43:55,041
Are you here all night?

961
01:43:55,516 --> 01:43:59,166
Mostly, sometimes it's Wisdom.

962
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:06,500
Well, I'm happy you're doing well.

963
01:44:07,699 --> 01:44:08,699
Thank you.

964
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:11,791
Mofe...

965
01:44:12,848 --> 01:44:15,416
your father is sick.

966
01:44:19,935 --> 01:44:21,374
So you've come for money.

967
01:44:21,574 --> 01:44:24,000
No, we haven't.

968
01:44:25,051 --> 01:44:29,166
Mofe, listen to me.

969
01:44:30,826 --> 01:44:33,500
We didn't come for money.

970
01:44:35,609 --> 01:44:40,291
Your father is already better.
He'll be out of the hospital soon.

971
01:44:41,922 --> 01:44:45,208
We came here because...

972
01:44:51,476 --> 01:44:54,125
Mofe, we're broke.

973
01:44:55,224 --> 01:44:57,449
We've spent everything.

974
01:44:57,649 --> 01:45:02,500
My money, his money,
even Blessing's money.

975
01:45:03,856 --> 01:45:07,666
Mofe, we don't have anything again.

976
01:45:07,866 --> 01:45:10,810
- I beg you.
- Please get up, get up.

977
01:45:11,010 --> 01:45:12,987
Mofe, I beg you, take my son from me.

978
01:45:13,187 --> 01:45:14,192
I can't.

979
01:45:14,392 --> 01:45:16,723
If he comes back with me,
there's nothing there for him.

980
01:45:16,923 --> 01:45:20,333
It's only me here.
I work for myself.

981
01:45:21,514 --> 01:45:24,458
Why should I take care
of my father's children?

982
01:45:25,767 --> 01:45:30,375
The first time he saw Precious' children
was when we came to bury them.

983
01:45:33,299 --> 01:45:36,776
And you want me to
take care of his children?

984
01:45:36,976 --> 01:45:38,625
Never!

985
01:46:04,335 --> 01:46:05,916
Thank you.

986
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:36,333
Mind your bags.

987
01:46:50,834 --> 01:46:54,416
Aunty, here's a little money.
Blessing, help your mother.

988
01:47:11,809 --> 01:47:13,375
What about power?

989
01:47:14,748 --> 01:47:18,250
When you're ready, we'll tap it.

990
01:47:21,115 --> 01:47:24,458
You don't like it?
Should I show you another one?

991
01:47:25,227 --> 01:47:26,108
Yeah.

992
01:47:26,308 --> 01:47:28,208
Alright, let's go.

993
01:47:28,724 --> 01:47:30,500
Hey, don't forget to close up.

994
01:47:38,516 --> 01:47:40,166
It's ready.

995
01:47:58,308 --> 01:48:01,833
Try it and see.
I know you're going to like it.

996
01:48:10,482 --> 01:48:12,166
Now put it on.

997
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:16,666
We know what we're doing here.

998
01:48:40,268 --> 01:48:41,566
Boss.

999
01:48:42,891 --> 01:48:44,358
Come, take a look.

1000
01:48:48,476 --> 01:48:50,212
What do you think?

1001
01:48:51,627 --> 01:48:53,358
Good work.

1002
01:48:58,416 --> 01:48:59,544
Hello?

1003
01:49:02,019 --> 01:49:03,984
Hey, Aunty.

1004
01:49:04,184 --> 01:49:06,914
No, sorry, I was busy.

1005
01:49:08,833 --> 01:49:09,957
Yes.

1006
01:49:11,758 --> 01:49:14,472
Thank you, thank you, I'm fine.

1007
01:49:19,767 --> 01:49:20,900
Generator.

1008
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:23,958
No, no, it's Wisdom I'm talking to.

1009
01:49:28,056 --> 01:49:32,250
Oh, no, it's no problem, no problem.

1010
01:49:34,556 --> 01:49:37,583
Truly, Aunty, it's no problem.

1011
01:49:41,422 --> 01:49:45,250
I hope it's not too
late for him to register.

1012
01:49:49,392 --> 01:49:51,208
We thank God.

1013
01:49:54,541 --> 01:50:01,250
If there's anything else he needs,
like books or anything else...

1014
01:50:02,392 --> 01:50:04,208
just let me know.

1015
01:50:05,184 --> 01:50:09,375
And I'll be checking in from time to time.

1016
01:50:13,432 --> 01:50:14,916
Bye bye.
