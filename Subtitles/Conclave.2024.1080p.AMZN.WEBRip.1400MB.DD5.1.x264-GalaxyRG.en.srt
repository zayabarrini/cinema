1
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:17,643
(light music)

2
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,016
(tense music)

3
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,495
(rapid footsteps approaching)

4
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,663
(heavy breathing)

5
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,712
(tense music crescendo)

6
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,673
(traffic humming)

7
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:40,935
(church bell rings)

8
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,645
(background chatter)

9
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,732
(sinister music)

10
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,825
(elevator announcements)

11
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,538
(heavy door opens)

12
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:08,212
(quiet chatter)

13
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,182
(music crescendo)

14
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,017
(ominous beat)

15
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:25,331
(ominous beat)

16
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,667
He is with God.

17
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,254
(ominous music)

18
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,474
(dramatic music)
(sobbing)

19
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,490
(metal scrapes)

20
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,955
(light hammering)

21
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,250
(clang)

22
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,628
(sombre music)

23
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,517
The throne of the Holy See

24
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:28,977
is vacant.

25
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,232
(dramatic music)

26
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,084
Aldo.

27
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,502
(quiet chatter)

28
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,632
Hey, do you think that anybody
would mind

29
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,927
if I took that, as a keepsake?
- Of course, take it.

30
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,804
He would've wanted you to
have it.

31
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:07,016
Because we used to play quite often in
the evenings.

32
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,519
He said... it helped him
to relax. (chuckles)

33
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,770
And who won?

34
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:12,895
- Oh, he did.
- (laughs)

35
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,648
He was always eight moves ahead.

36
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,317
Hmm.

37
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:18,443
Aldo...

38
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,237
I'm sorry.

39
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,362
Hmm.

40
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:24,658
No, go on. What happened,
do you know?

41
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,494
No. They say a heart attack,
but...

42
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,663
there had been warnings.

43
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,415
I don't know.
I hadn't heard that.

44
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,709
Yeah. He didn't want anyone
to know.

45
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,170
He was afraid that if word
got out

46
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,006
that they would start
circulating rumours

47
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,716
that he was going to resign.

48
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:43,801
The Curia.

49
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,597
(ominous music)
Yes.

50
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:49,974
Okay.

51
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,279
I know this is hard for you,
but...

52
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,032
we will have to prepare a detailed statement.

53
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,244
Who discovered
the Holy Father's body?

54
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,498
I did, Your Eminence.

55
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,291
And then what did you do?

56
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:20,005
I... called the Holy Father's
doctor.

57
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,256
Mm-hmm.

58
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,883
But it was too late.

59
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,008
Mm-hmm.

60
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,886
And what time was this?

61
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,599
Around... 11:30, Eminence.

62
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,186
We would have called you
earlier, but...

63
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,400
Thomas, I'm so sorry.

64
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:43,195
I know His Holiness had
no colleagues

65
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,988
closer than you and Aldo.

66
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,534
But I asked Janusz to hold off
calling you.

67
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,662
I wanted to ascertain
all the facts.

68
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,581
You know how rumour spreads.

69
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:59,711
I've prepared a timeline of
His Holiness's last day,

70
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:05,968
and these are the Holy Father''s
most recent medical records.

71
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,096
And who was the last to have
a scheduled meeting with him?

72
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,639
I believe that may have been me.

73
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,474
Father Wozniak,
I was the last one?

74
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,685
You were, Eminence Tremblay.

75
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,521
Put in all the meetings he had
that day.

76
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,733
It will show how hard he was
working right to the very end.

77
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:22,859
Well...

78
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,737
it might look like we
were placing

79
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,115
a huge burden on a sick man.

80
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,242
The Papacy is a huge burden,

81
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,327
especially for an older man.

82
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,247
(tense beat)

83
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,834
Well, Dean,

84
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,128
it seems the responsibility for the Conclave

85
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,253
falls upon you.

86
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,214
(sombre music)

87
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,942
(in Italian): Seal the room.

88
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,694
(dramatic music)

89
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,989
(zipping)

90
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,621
(high tempo music)
(gurney clanking)

91
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,459
(straps pulling)

92
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,344
(light switch clicks)

93
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:35,766
(door closes)

94
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,821
(gurney wheels trundling)

95
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,717
(siren blares)

96
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,936
(quiet, rhythmic clacking)

97
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,290
(lively street sounds)

98
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,059
(in English): Security say they'd like to test

99
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,978
the electronic jammers
one last time, Your Eminence.

100
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,187
Well, then they'd better
be quick.

101
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,005
Is this really necessary, Willi?

102
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:49,965
Apparently so.

103
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,800
They say eavesdroppers
can use lasers

104
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,468
to read the vibrations
of the glass.

105
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,154
Really? Well, let's hope none of our brothers

106
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,388
suffer from claustrophobia.

107
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,640
And who knows how long we're going to be in here?

108
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,268
Can you reassure me that we
will be finished on time?

109
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,288
They will work through
the night if they have to.

110
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,689
It will be fine, Your Eminence.
It always is.

111
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,275
- Italy, you know.
- I'm sorry to fuss.

112
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:12,779
Well, Eminence, I'd say this is
a pretty fair vision of hell.

113
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,323
Well, don't be blasphemous, Ray.

114
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,574
Hell arrives tomorrow

115
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,117
when we bring in the cardinals.

116
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,828
Now, how do I pronounce this?

117
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,123
Kahl-koh, Your Eminence.
He's Indian.

118
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,541
Oh, Kahl-koh, thank you.

119
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:31,715
Archbishop Wozniak has asked if
he might have a word, Eminence.

120
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,609
Well, I don't think that's
possible.

121
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,273
The cardinals will be arriving
in an hour.

122
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,220
What's it about?
- He didn't say.

123
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,123
I... I wouldn't have
brought it up,

124
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,476
it's just he seemed so... upset.

125
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,579
Ray, we're going to be
sequestered from six o'clock.

126
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,788
He should've come to me earlier.

127
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,292
Yes, Your Eminence.
I'll let him know.

128
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,775
No, Ray...

129
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,234
tell him that I will see him

130
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,778
after I've met the cardinals.

131
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:53,903
The poor fellow will be

132
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,572
worrying about his future.

133
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,407
(whirring, buzzing)

134
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,248
(quiet prayers whispered)

135
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,466
(distant traffic rumbling)

136
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,512
(footsteps echoing)

137
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,009
(distant tannoy announcement)

138
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,860
(ominous music)

139
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,200
(high tempo music)

140
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,295
(helicopter whirring)

141
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,421
(men chattering)

142
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,053
(laughing)

143
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,422
(high tempo music continues)

144
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,856
So, how many is that, Willi?

145
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,816
103, Eminence Lawrence.

146
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,360
I wonder where Tedesco
has got to.

147
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:58,570
Perhaps he's not coming.

148
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,322
Well, that'd be too much
to hope for.

149
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,866
(chuckling)

150
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,385
We could wait inside,
if you prefer.

151
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,249
No, let's stay out here and get some fresh air

152
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,370
while we can.

153
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,496
Ah.

154
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,918
Father Bellini.

155
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,377
(echoing footsteps)

156
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:15,587
Aldo.

157
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,257
- Am I the last?
- Not quite. How are you?

158
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,968
Oh, well, you know,
fairly dreadful.

159
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,905
- Have you seen the papers?
- Mm-hmm.

160
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,615
Apparently it's already decided
it's to be me.

161
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,265
And I happen to agree with them.

162
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,976
(scoffs) What if I don't
want it?

163
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,020
No sane man would want
the Papacy.

164
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,023
Some of our colleagues seem to
want it.

165
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,943
What if I know in my heart that
I am not worthy?

166
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,611
You are more worthy than any
of us.

167
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,214
- I'm not.
- Well, then tell your supporters

168
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,949
not to vote for you.
Pass the chalice.

169
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,534
And let it go to him?

170
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,494
I could never live with myself.

171
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,162
(helicopter whirring)

172
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,873
(in Italian): Eminence Tedesco.

173
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,208
(laughter)

174
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,793
Dean Lawrence!

175
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:56,670
How are you?

176
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,088
I'm well, Goffredo.

177
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,209
(in English): Sorry, my train
was delayed from Venice.

178
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,968
(in Italian): We've missed you.
- Yes.

179
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,135
No doubt.

180
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:08,139
(in English): But don't worry,
my friends have kept me well informed.

181
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,345
(in Italian): Are you well?

182
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,269
(in English): No one is ever well at our age.

183
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,645
(in Italian): True.

184
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,689
(in English): And you, huh?

185
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,315
How do you feel with your new,

186
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,734
er, responsibility?

187
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,319
(uneasy laugh)

188
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:24,406
Everything under control?

189
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,716
(in Italian): Yes, I believe so.

190
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,117
Eminence Tedesco, may I?
- No.

191
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,744
(in English): See you later.

192
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,989
(in Italian): You're welcome.
See you later, Eminence.

193
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,669
(plastic rustling)

194
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,007
(in English): Tell you what, that's enormous.

195
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,050
Apparently Pope John the 23rd
was too fat

196
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,055
to fit into the biggest cassock, so they had to

197
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,512
split the seam
at the back

198
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,930
for him to get into it.

199
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,432
(chuckling)

200
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,059
No.

201
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,938
You look tired.

202
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,566
Well, all this is...

203
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,360
a duty I thought I'd never have
to perform.

204
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,529
I thought he would outlive
all of us.

205
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,200
We didn't part well.

206
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,666
I asked for his permission to
resign as Dean,

207
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,210
join an order.

208
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,004
What did he say?

209
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,465
He refused my resignation.

210
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,467
Said some were chosen to
be shepherds

211
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,637
and some to manage
the farm.

212
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,597
Apparently I am a manager.

213
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:31,722
(laughs softly)

214
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,143
He told me about your
crisis of faith.

215
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:41,316
But you should know that he had
his own doubts...

216
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,151
towards the end.

217
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,987
Wow, the Pope had doubts
about God?

218
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,112
No.

219
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:50,033
Never about God.

220
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,202
What he had lost faith in was
the church.

221
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,205
(door creaks opens)
Father Wozniak?

222
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,581
(loud chatter)

223
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,208
In the name of the Father, the Son,

224
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,501
and the Holy Ghost.

225
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,066
- My last confession was...
- Janusz.

226
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,253
four weeks ago.
- Janusz,

227
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,379
I haven't got time

228
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,547
to hear your confession.

229
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,299
There's still so much to do.

230
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:08,676
Have you been drinking?

231
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,098
What's troubling you? Tell me.

232
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,476
I should have come to you
before,

233
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,813
but I promised not to
say anything.

234
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:20,938
Promised who?

235
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,399
Cardinal Tremblay.

236
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,818
Janusz, the doors close soon
and you'll have to leave.

237
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,528
Now, if you promised
Cardinal Tremblay,

238
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,255
then perhaps it isn't
right that you're...

239
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,781
The day the Pope died,

240
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,742
the last person to have
an official appointment with him

241
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,953
was Cardinal Tremblay.
- Yes, I know,

242
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,205
it's on the official timeline.
- At that meeting,

243
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,998
the Holy Father dismissed him.

244
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,043
What?

245
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,586
He sacked him!

246
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,631
Why?

247
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,968
For gross misconduct.

248
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,847
And you tell me this now?

249
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,141
We're about to be sequestered,
Janusz.

250
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,269
Forgive me, but it wasn't until
the last few days

251
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,854
when I started to hear
the rumours.

252
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,021
What rumours?

253
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:04,232
That he may be elected Pope.

254
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,277
Oh, and you see it as your duty
to prevent that, do you?

255
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,280
I... I no longer know what my duty is.

256
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,045
Were you there at this meeting?

257
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,547
No, Your Eminence.

258
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,425
The Holy Father told me about
it afterwards,

259
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,718
when we had supper.

260
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,636
Did he tell you why

261
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,472
he had dismissed
Eminence Tremblay?

262
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,432
Err... no.

263
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,228
He said the reasons would
become clear soon enough.

264
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,564
(dramatic music)

265
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,649
(echoing footsteps)

266
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:53,865
(doors grind, clang closed)

267
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,828
(shutters clang, trundle)

268
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,593
(shutters clang shut)

269
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,603
(steam hissing)

270
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:28,942
(terrines boiling)

271
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,360
(quiet chatter)

272
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,039
(cutlery clinking)

273
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,977
(nuns talking)

274
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,353
Dean Lawrence...

275
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,271
an issue.

276
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,482
Oh, dear God.

277
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,693
One of them's died?
- I'm sorry?

278
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,194
Have we lost a cardinal?

279
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,320
No, Your Eminence.

280
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,197
We seem to have acquired one.

281
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,490
I mean it literally.

282
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:20,368
Another cardinal has just
turned up.

283
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,704
Well, then, we've left someone
off the list.

284
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,582
He was never on our list,
Eminence.

285
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,876
He says he was created
in pectore.

286
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,169
Oh no, then he has to be
an imposter, surely.

287
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:31,772
Well, that's what I thought,
Eminence.

288
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,673
But Archbishop Mandorff has
spoken to him

289
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,258
and he thinks not.

290
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,678
Er, what's this I'm hearing?

291
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,349
His name is Vincent Benitez,
Your Eminence.

292
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,518
He's the Archbishop of Kabul.

293
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,562
Archbishop of where?

294
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,730
Kabul.

295
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,231
But he's Mexican.

296
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,567
The Holy Father appointed him
last year.

297
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,862
Last year? So, how has this
been kept a secret for so long?

298
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,107
I thought perhaps you would be aware of
his elevation.

299
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,909
No, I'm not. Ray, ask
Eminence Bellini to join us,

300
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,577
maybe he knows something
of this.

301
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,329
- Yes, Eminence.
- Thank you.

302
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,748
He has a letter of appointment from the Pope,

303
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,125
addressed to the
archdiocese of Kabul,

304
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,502
which they kept secret at
the Holy Father's request.

305
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,628
Mm-hmm.

306
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,215
You don't think he could've
forged it?

307
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,968
Well, err, where is he now?

308
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,972
BELLINI: A cardinal in
Afghanistan?

309
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,657
- LAWRENCE: Hmm.
- BELLINI: It's absurd.

310
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,434
How many Catholics are there
in Afghanistan?

311
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,370
LAWRENCE: He was head of
the Catholic mission there

312
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,896
until his elevation.

313
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,857
But how can we possibly ensure
his safety?

314
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,984
Well, presumably that's why
the Holy Father

315
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,486
wanted it kept a secret.

316
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:39,405
Well, it won't be in
pectore now.

317
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,325
I don't think we have any
choice but to admit him.

318
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,452
Wait, wait. Thomas.

319
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,289
Are we sure...

320
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,750
that the Holy Father
was entirely...

321
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,502
competent...

322
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,087
when he made this appointment?

323
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,714
(stutters)

324
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,513
I believe this man is legally
a cardinal, Aldo, and I...

325
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,891
I think he has a right
to take part in the election.

326
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,704
(loud clanging)
(chatter)

327
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:31,666
(knife clinks on glass)

328
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,545
Eminences, before we eat,

329
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,173
I'd like to introduce a new
member of our order,

330
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,802
whose existence
was not known to any of us

331
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,138
erm, until only a few hours ago.

332
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,265
This is because our brother

333
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,728
was made a cardinal by the
perfectly legitimate procedure

334
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:54,897
known as creation in pectore.

335
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,400
Now, the reason why it had to
be done this way

336
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,737
is known only to God and to
the late Holy Father.

337
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:02,342
But I think we can guess well enough,

338
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,657
as our new brother's ministry

339
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,951
is an extremely dangerous one.

340
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,704
Welcome to our order,

341
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,664
Vincent Benitez,

342
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,208
Cardinal Archbishop of...

343
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,334
Kabul.

344
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,962
(quiet chatter)

345
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,631
(applause)

346
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,645
Eminence, please would you
bless our meal?

347
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,647
Of course.
(chairs scrape)

348
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,401
Bless us, oh Lord,

349
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,528
and these, your gifts,

350
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,614
which we are about to receive from your bounty.

351
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:45,782
ALL: Amen.

352
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,075
(men chattering)

353
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,535
(in Spanish): Bless all those

354
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:54,040
who cannot share this meal
with us

355
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:57,752
and help us, O Lord,
as we wat and drink,

356
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,587
to remember the hungry,

357
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,798
the thirsty,

358
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,509
the sick,

359
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,427
and the lonely,

360
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,347
and the sisters who prepared
this food for us.

361
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:11,641
Through Christ Our Lord.

362
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,601
Amen.

363
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:16,604
(in English): Amen.

364
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,606
Please, come.
(loud chatter)

365
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,732
This is your...

366
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:31,786
(in Italian): Dean!

367
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,459
Goffredo.

368
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:39,585
Thomas.

369
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,710
(laughs)

370
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,129
Come.

371
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,423
(in English): Take some wine.

372
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:45,716
(wine pouring)

373
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,136
(in Italian): Thank you.

374
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:53,963
(in English): You look anxious.

375
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,058
Oh...

376
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,603
(in Italian): And we haven't
even begun yet.

377
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:58,728
(laughs)

378
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:01,834
(in English): Our new brother...

379
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,818
(in Italian): Did I hear correctly, Afghanistan?

380
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:04,943
Yes.

381
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:08,865
A marvellous testament to
the Universal Church,

382
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,827
So many men of different
cultures, races,

383
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,454
bound together
by their faith in God.

384
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:17,915
(snorts with laughter)

385
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
Hmm?

386
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:21,668
Look around you.

387
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,798
Notice how everyone gravitates
to their fellow countrymen.

388
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,342
Italians over here.

389
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:29,886
Spanish speakers there,

390
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:30,845
Mm-hmm.

391
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,804
English there.

392
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:32,929
Yes.

393
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,098
French.

394
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,349
(laughs heartily)

395
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,227
(in English):
Divided by language.

396
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:42,773
(in Italian): When we were boys
and the Tridentine Mass

397
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,859
was still the only true liturgy
of the world,

398
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,987
we would all have been
speaking Latin.

399
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:52,283
But then your fellow liberals
insisted we get rid of that

400
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,659
"dead" language.

401
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:54,784
(chuckles)

402
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:59,123
Without Rome, without
the tradition of Rome...

403
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:03,628
(in English): Things fall apart.

404
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,297
The centre cannot hold.

405
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:12,678
(in Italian): So what,
the next pope must be Italian?

406
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:13,803
Why not?

407
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,726
We haven't had an Italian pope for more
than 40 years. 40 years, Tommaso.

408
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,022
Can you seriously imagine
the alternative?

409
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,732
(cardinals laughing, chatting)

410
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:38,037
Excuse me, I must circulate
amongst our brothers.

411
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,833
The abyss calls out.

412
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,927
(in English): It was shrewd of him to stay away

413
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,467
from Rome until today.

414
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,470
One outspoken newspaper
interview

415
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,180
could have written Tedesco off.

416
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,518
But instead, he will do well
tomorrow, I think.

417
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,436
LAWRENCE: Which means?

418
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,938
SABBADIN: I would say...

419
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:07,066
he's worth 15 votes
on the first ballet.

420
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,567
LAWRENCE: And Bellini?

421
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:09,777
(soft music)

422
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:16,117
BELLINI: Why do I feel like a
cow being priced by the farmer?

423
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,285
SABBADIN: First ballot...

424
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:22,164
Between 20 and 25.

425
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:26,127
But it is tomorrow night that
the real work begins.

426
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:31,841
Somehow we have to get him
a two thirds majority, hmm?

427
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,385
By real work you mean what, exactly?

428
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,805
LANDOLFI: But Eminence Bellini, those who seek
the Papacy...

429
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,891
I don't "seek" the Papacy. I...
(doors rattle open)

430
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,645
(cardinal clears his throat)

431
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,734
(metal clanging, rolling)

432
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,405
(in Italian): Thank you, Sisters.

433
00:26:58,993 --> 00:26:59,827
(door closes)

434
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,805
(in English): Listen, you don't
have to do anything.

435
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,289
Just leave it to us.

436
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:06,292
BELLINI: Tell them I stand for a
common-sense approach

437
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,421
to such issues as gays
and divorce.

438
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:14,008
Tell them I stand for never
returning to the days

439
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,926
of the Latin liturgy,

440
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,137
or families of ten children

441
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,431
because Mama and Papa
didn't know any better.

442
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,683
That was an ugly
and repressive time

443
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,185
and I'm glad that it's over.

444
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,354
Tell them I stand for...

445
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,980
respecting other faiths,

446
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:31,942
for tolerating other views
within our own church.

447
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:35,404
And tell them that I believe

448
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,032
women should play more of
a role in the Curia.

449
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,200
Let's, um...

450
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,202
Let's not mention women.

451
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:42,327
Why?

452
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:46,165
Brother, I have no intention of
concealing my views

453
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,209
or pretending to be anything
other than I am

454
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,836
in order to sway any of our
number who are undecided.

455
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:51,961
So...

456
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,841
if you want to canvas
on my behalf,

457
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,052
then make sure that
my message is clear.

458
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:02,765
I stand for everything that
Tedesco does not.

459
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,312
- Okay.
- If you'll excuse me.

460
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,857
(footsteps receding)

461
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,193
SABBADIN: Alright.

462
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:17,029
Rocco, you talk to the Americans.

463
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,281
Villanueva, I'll leave
the South Americans to you.

464
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,326
Gianmarco,
you take the Africans.

465
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,994
Aldo doesn't want it.

466
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,287
Any of it.

467
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,958
You know that, don't you?

468
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,418
SABBADIN: Of course, I do.

469
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:31,794
That's why I support him.

470
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:33,838
The men who are dangerous

471
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,840
are the ones who do want it.

472
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,427
(beeping)
(door opens)

473
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:47,601
I'm enjoying all this mystery,
Thomas.

474
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,727
(door closes)

475
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:53,190
And I suppose you should tell
me what you want to talk about.

476
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,487
Your last meeting with
the Holy Father.

477
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:00,614
Oh, what about it?

478
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,409
Well, I've been told
it was difficult.

479
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,955
- Was it?
- TREMBLAY: Difficult? No.

480
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,665
Not that I can recall.

481
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,394
Well, I... I'm sorry to have to
ask you this, Joe,

482
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,419
but to be specific,

483
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,254
I was told that the Holy Father

484
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,755
demanded your resignation.

485
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:19,132
What?

486
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:21,927
- That's absurd.
- I...

487
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,014
I don't know what we...
who... who told you that?

488
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,139
Archbishop Wozniak.

489
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,766
Why would he say such a thing?

490
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:30,811
So, there isn't any truth in the allegation?

491
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,522
Oh God, no, of course not. It's absurd.

492
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:34,647
Hmm.

493
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,985
- You don't think that...
- No, well, I... I had to ask.

494
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,945
I understand, but no.

495
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,448
You... you can ask
Monsignor Morales.

496
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:43,824
He was at the meeting.

497
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:44,742
Well, I would,

498
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:45,868
but at the moment

499
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,786
we happen to be sequestered.

500
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:48,912
Oh.

501
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:57,046
Can you think of any reason why
Archbishop Wozniak

502
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,714
would circulate such a story?

503
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,883
No, I can't.
(coffee machine buzzes)

504
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,677
I really... do you want a coffee?
(coffee machine buzzes)

505
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,802
No.

506
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:05,967
TREMBLAY: (frustrated sigh)

507
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:07,765
I'm shocked.

508
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,142
He told you this himself?

509
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:11,267
Yeah.

510
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,233
You don't think...?

511
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:20,944
Well, what?

512
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:23,197
The drinking?

513
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,407
I don't like to bring it up, but we both know

514
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,577
his drinking has been getting
much heavier.

515
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:33,457
And perhaps it's affecting his
judgement, hi-his mind even.

516
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,210
And...
(sighs)

517
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,548
I know my name has
been mentioned as a future Pope.

518
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,676
And if the Archbishop doesn't
approve of that idea,

519
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,135
maybe he's...

520
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:49,682
I don't know, I... I'm just
trying to make sense of this.

521
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:52,893
And the poor man.

522
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:55,896
He was shattered by
the Holy Father's death.

523
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:57,690
Yes, indeed.

524
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,858
Again, Joe, er, my apologies.

525
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,360
No, not at all.

526
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,530
I completely understand.

527
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,365
(door opens)

528
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,490
Erm...

529
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:10,953
what did you discuss with
the Holy Father

530
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,621
in that final
meeting?

531
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,123
Forgive me, Thomas.

532
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,418
It was a private conversation,

533
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,044
and very precious.

534
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:21,630
Those were the last words
I ever exchanged

535
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,173
with the Holy Father.

536
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:25,634
Yes, of course.

537
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:28,596
Goodnight, Joe.

538
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:30,806
Goodnight Thomas.

539
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,142
(footsteps receding)

540
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,980
(door closes, locks)

541
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:40,983
(dramatic music)

542
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:45,696
- Decano.
- Ah!

543
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,742
Oh, we're neighbours, Joshua.

544
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:52,244
Ah, it appears so. (chuckles)

545
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,747
I thought that I should, er...
(door beeps, opens)

546
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:57,583
do a little more work on
my homily for tomorrow.

547
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:00,127
Ah, yes, of course. I look forward to it.

548
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,253
(Lawrence chuckles)

549
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:02,421
I understand the trick

550
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,256
is to offend no one.

551
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:07,343
(both chuckling)

552
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:12,139
(key clicks, beeping)
(door opens)

553
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,018
(door closes)

554
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:29,740
(cardinal chanting through wall)

555
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,911
(toilet flushes)

556
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:48,092
(soft music)
(packet rumples)

557
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:58,519
(packet rips)
(clattering)

558
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,402
You're a manager.

559
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:09,822
Manage.

560
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,491
(dramatic music)

561
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,585
(choral music)
(church bells ring)

562
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:25,295
BENITEZ: Decano Lawrence?

563
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:27,256
(echoing, distorted chatter)

564
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,176
(footsteps receding)

565
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,611
(chain clanks)
(choral chanting)

566
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,967
(book opens, pages turn)

567
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,977
(in Italian): Dear Brothers in Christ,

568
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:08,315
at the moment of great
uncertainty,

569
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,484
in the history of
the Holy Church,

570
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:15,030
we must think first of
the late Holy Father,

571
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:20,118
whose brilliant pontificate
was a gift from God,

572
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:26,166
now we must ask our Lord to
send us a new Holy Father,

573
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:31,380
through the pastoral solicitude
of the cardinal fathers.

574
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:37,177
And we must pray to God for
that loving assistance,

575
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,805
and ask Him to guide us

576
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:44,017
to the right choice.

577
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,109
(in English):
But you know all that.

578
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:56,780
Let me speak from the heart for
a moment.

579
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,410
St Paul said, 'Be subject to
one another

580
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:03,745
out of reverence for Christ.'

581
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,582
To work together, and to, er...

582
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:10,127
to grow together,
we must be tolerant.

583
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:15,007
No one person or... or faction
seeking to dominate another.

584
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,051
And speaking to the Ephesians,

585
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,513
who were of course a mixture of
Jews and gentiles,

586
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:25,809
Paul reminds us that God's gift
to the church...

587
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,770
is its variety.

588
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:32,774
It is this variety, this diversity of
people and views

589
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,403
which gives our church
its strength.

590
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,808
And over the course of
many years

591
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,573
in the service of our
Mother the Church,

592
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,159
let me tell you, there is
one sin,

593
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:45,120
which I have come to
fear above all others.

594
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,373
Certainty.

595
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,418
(someone clears his throat)

596
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,087
Certainty is the great enemy of unity.

597
00:36:56,757 --> 00:37:00,135
Certainty is the deadly enemy
of tolerance.

598
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,265
Even Christ was not certain
at the end.

599
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,143
(in Italian): My God, My God, why are you
forsaken me?

600
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:12,314
(in English): He cried out in his agony at the
ninth hour on the cross.

601
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:15,484
Our faith is a living thing,

602
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:19,321
precisely because it walks
hand-in-hand with doubt.

603
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,658
If there was only certainty...

604
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:24,409
and no doubt...

605
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,454
there would be no mystery...

606
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,789
(whispering)

607
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,750
and therefore no need...
for faith.

608
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:39,675
Let us pray that God will grant
us a Pope who doubts.

609
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,096
And let him grant us a Pope who
sins and asks for forgiveness,

610
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,556
and who carries on.

611
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:56,817
(sombre music)

612
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:05,826
(quiet prayers uttered)

613
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:09,871
(bell tolls)

614
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,558
(ominous music)

615
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:47,784
Dean Lawrence...

616
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:51,496
your homily has
caused quite the stir.

617
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,290
I don't think anyone expected
you to...

618
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,000
To say something interesting?

619
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,589
I'll have a transcript made of
the recording.

620
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:01,714
Mm-hmm.

621
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:06,219
If, erm, if there's nothing
else...

622
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,849
Eminence.

623
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,267
Yes, erm...

624
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,229
I... I need you to do
something for me.

625
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,148
Monsignor Morales...

626
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,941
I'm sure he's still in Rome.

627
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,069
Could you try and see him?

628
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,404
- Today? I... I...
- Use my authority.

629
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,114
I'd like to know what happened

630
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,283
in the final meeting between
Cardinal Tremblay

631
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:29,659
and the Holy Father.

632
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,037
What happened?

633
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,955
Specifically, did anything
occur that might

634
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:37,167
render Tremblay unfit for
the Papacy?

635
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,548
Of course, Your Eminence.

636
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,549
Bless you.

637
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:49,304
(footsteps receding)

638
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:55,185
(slap)
(high tempo music)

639
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,834
(security radio chatter)

640
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:26,424
(in Latin): And I,
Irumbus Cardinal Nakitanda,

641
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:32,055
I promise, I vow and I swear
so God will help me

642
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:37,102
and these Holy Gospels of God,
which I touch with my hand.

643
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:38,270
(cameras clicking)

644
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,995
(tense music)

645
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:58,415
Out, everyone.

646
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,458
(loud clatter)

647
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,337
(another loud clatter)

648
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,964
(quiet chatter)

649
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:09,801
(distant choral singing)

650
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,269
(bell tolls)

651
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,108
(bell tolls)

652
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,031
(bell tolls)

653
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:36,369
(bell tolls)

654
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:41,666
(bell tolls)

655
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,585
(quiet chatter)
(distant choral singing)

656
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:47,380
(lock clicks)

657
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,801
(doors click)

658
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,224
(doors close with heavy bang)

659
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:58,892
(locks click loudly)

660
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,494
(in Italian): Cardinal brothers,

661
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:21,206
we will now proceed to
the first ballot.

662
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:25,627
You will find in front of you
your ballot paper.

663
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:30,674
On the top half is written,
"I elect as Supreme Pontiff."

664
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:35,553
Please make sure your
handwriting is legible.

665
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,772
(quiet whispering)

666
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,192
(papers rustling)

667
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:01,371
(pens scratching on paper)

668
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:04,040
(paper folds)

669
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:10,463
(in Latin): I call as my witness Christ the Lord
who will be my judge

670
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:14,718
that my vote is given to
the one who, before God,

671
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:17,262
I think should be elected.

672
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,976
(ballot clangs)
(lid clinks)

673
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,195
(somebody coughs)

674
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:56,343
(in Italian): The first vote
is cast for Cardinal Tedesco.

675
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:06,936
The second vote is cast for
Cardinal Tedesco.

676
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,815
Cardinal Tremblay.

677
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,196
Cardinale Tremblay.

678
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,200
Cardinale Tedesco.

679
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,704
Cardinale Adeyemi.

680
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:29,542
Cardinale Lawrence.

681
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,256
Cardinale Bellini.

682
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:40,178
Cardinale Bellini.

683
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,891
Cardinale Villanueva.

684
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,436
Cardinale Tremblay.

685
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,232
Cardinale Adeyemi.

686
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:55,985
Cardinale Tremblay.

687
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,155
Cardinale Tedesco.

688
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:02,742
Cardinale Bellini.

689
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,787
Cardinale Adeyemi.

690
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,750
And finally, Cardinal Benitez.

691
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:18,007
The results of
the first ballot are...

692
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:21,678
Cardinal Adeyemi,
21 votes.

693
00:45:22,846 --> 00:45:26,057
Cardinal Tedesco,
18 votes.

694
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:30,645
Cardinal Bellini,
17 votes.

695
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:34,149
Cardinal Tremblay,
16 votes.

696
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:37,444
Cardinal Lawrence, 5 votes.

697
00:45:38,445 --> 00:45:43,450
Other cardinals assigned
a single vote, 31 votes

698
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:45,368
(mumbling, chatter)

699
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,667
(dramatic music)

700
00:45:57,464 --> 00:45:58,756
My brother cardinals,

701
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:01,718
that concludes the first ballot.

702
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:04,554
No candidate having achieved

703
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:07,932
the necessary majority
of 72 votes,

704
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:11,478
we shall adjourn for
the evening,

705
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:14,772
and resume voting in
the morning.

706
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:16,649
Thank you.

707
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,735
(ominous music)

708
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,861
(loud knocking on door)

709
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:22,697
(doors clank open)

710
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:27,243
(key turns)

711
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,454
(button clicks)

712
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,122
{\an8}(smoke hisses, billows)

713
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,254
(crowd cheers)

714
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,888
(high tempo music)

715
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,953
(in English): The media have noticed the presence
of a cardinal

716
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,777
who doesn't appear on
the official list, Dean,

717
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:55,980
Cardinal Benitez.

718
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,440
So, I've taken the liberty of

719
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:59,317
putting together
a draft statement.

720
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,444
I've also put together some biographical details

721
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:02,654
for yourself.

722
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:05,448
The ministries in Veracruz, the Congo,

723
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,868
where he established a hospital
for the female victims

724
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,954
of genocidal sexual violence

725
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:13,164
during the first and second
wars.

726
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:17,585
Then Baghdad, and finally, a mission in Kabul.

727
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,170
Right.

728
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,895
There was some question of his resigning

729
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,006
on health grounds,

730
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:23,331
but apparently the Holy Father

731
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:24,676
convinced him to continue.

732
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,121
He's certainly served his
ministry

733
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:27,428
in some terrible places.

734
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:29,389
- Yes.
- Health grounds.

735
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:31,099
Look into that, would you, Ray?

736
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:32,600
It's the kind of thing

737
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,018
the press like to get hold of.

738
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,270
Of course.

739
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:39,107
And the, erm... other matter.
The...

740
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,569
Yes.

741
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:46,364
I spoke to Monsignor Morales.

742
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:48,783
He was emphatic that he knows
of no reason why

743
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:51,661
Cardinal Tremblay should not
be Pope.

744
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,164
- Thank you.
- However...

745
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,958
will you forgive me if I say...

746
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:00,295
I did not entirely believe...

747
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,754
the good monsignor?

748
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:02,922
He was just...

749
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:07,051
so... emphatic.

750
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:08,595
My Spanish is quite poor

751
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,015
and I may have accidentally
given him the impression

752
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,642
that you had seen a document
that contradicts that.

753
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:17,520
And he said you weren't
to worry,

754
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:20,064
that... and his exact words were,

755
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:22,150
'El informe ha sido retirado.'

756
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:24,527
A report? A report about what?

757
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:26,529
Withdrawn when?

758
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,740
That... I couldn't say, Eminence.

759
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:30,283
(treacherous music)

760
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:31,867
Hmm.

761
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:33,995
(people chattering)
(bell tolls)

762
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:37,540
(angry exhale)

763
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,005
(dramatic music)

764
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,381
Third place.

765
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,634
Not what we had hoped.

766
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,887
Your sermon didn't exactly
help us and you have five votes.

767
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:53,014
You have far too little support
to emerge

768
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,307
as a serious candidate.

769
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,118
Well, my position is an
embarrassment to me.

770
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:57,894
If I find out who my
supporters are,

771
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:59,937
I'll plead with them to
vote for someone else.

772
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,482
I'll tell them I'll be voting
for Aldo.

773
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:03,607
Alright.

774
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:07,111
That leaves 31 votes
available.

775
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:08,946
We simply have to pick up most
of them.

776
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:13,034
(squeaking)

777
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,159
(dramatic music)

778
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,083
(sirens blaring)

779
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:43,564
LAWRENCE:
The Holy Father's turtles.

780
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,483
He was very fond of them.

781
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,652
A gift from Angola.
(water babbling)

782
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:49,320
I thought I was imagining them.

783
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,364
I love them. They're so clever.

784
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,284
Well, here they keep escaping
and being run over. (chuckles)

785
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,704
We should go back,
the evening curfew.

786
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:03,584
And your health, how are you
bearing up?

787
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:05,586
My health is perfect, thank you.

788
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:08,506
I only meant have you recovered
from your journey?

789
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:10,133
- I have, indeed.
- Good.

790
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,928
And in the Sistine, you found
someone to vote for?

791
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:16,389
Yes. I voted for you.

792
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:19,726
Forgive me, am I not
supposed to say?

793
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:21,602
No, no, it's not that you...

794
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:24,397
No, I'm honoured, but...
my dear Vincent,

795
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:25,940
may I call you Vincent?

796
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:28,484
I'm not a serious candidate.

797
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:31,612
My vocation lies in
a different... um...

798
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,702
After the Conclave, I hope to
resign as Dean,

799
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,912
and then leave Rome altogether.

800
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,037
Why?

801
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,588
I've been experiencing
difficulties.

802
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:50,922
With your faith?

803
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:56,636
Prayer.

804
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:01,517
I only mention it to illustrate
my point

805
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:04,187
that I'm in no way
worthy to be Pope.

806
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:07,647
Come.

807
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,944
(intercom announcement)

808
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,449
(metal clanging)

809
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,284
(footsteps approaching)

810
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:20,828
Aldo.

811
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:25,457
Aldo.

812
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:32,173
I... I feel wretched that my
...my meagre tally of votes

813
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,217
may have come at your expense.

814
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,594
Hmm.

815
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:40,473
I had no idea you were
so ambitious.

816
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,517
Well, that's a ridiculous thing
to say.

817
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,309
Is it?

818
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:46,937
Is it?

819
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:49,482
I thought we had your support.

820
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:53,861
If we liberals are not united,
Tedesco will become Pope.

821
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:56,489
You have no idea how bad it
became, Thomas.

822
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,574
The way he and his circle
attacked the Holy Father

823
00:51:58,616 --> 00:51:59,492
towards the end.

824
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:00,409
The smears,

825
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:01,661
the leaks to the press.

826
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:03,246
It was savage.

827
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:06,791
He fought him every single day of his pontificate.

828
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:08,375
And now that he's dead,

829
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:09,627
he wants to destroy

830
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:10,878
his life's work.

831
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,798
If Tedesco becomes Pope,

832
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:17,510
he will undo 60 years
of progress.

833
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,315
You talk as if you're
the only alternative,

834
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:21,931
but Adeyemi has
the wind behind him.

835
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,224
- Adeyemi?
- Mm-hmm.

836
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,149
Adeyemi, the man who believes
that homosexuals

837
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:26,788
should be sent to prison
in this world,

838
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:28,104
and hell in the next.

839
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,731
Adeyemi's not the answer
to anything.

840
00:52:30,857 --> 00:52:31,857
And you know it.

841
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:33,763
If you want to defeat Tedesco...

842
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:35,987
Defeat? This is a Conclave,
Aldo,

843
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:38,531
it's not a war.
- It is a war!

844
00:52:39,115 --> 00:52:42,118
And you have to commit
to a side.

845
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:49,625
Save your precious doubts for
your prayers.

846
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:54,005
You can't seriously believe

847
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:57,216
that I have the slightest
desire to become Pope.

848
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,342
Come on!

849
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:00,761
Every cardinal has that desire.

850
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:03,014
Every cardinal deep down has
already chosen

851
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:05,391
the name by which he would like
his Papacy to be known.

852
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,393
Well... I haven't.

853
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:09,770
(scoffs) Deny it if you like,

854
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:13,441
but search your heart and then
tell me it isn't so.

855
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,241
(footsteps receding)

856
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:41,969
(soft music)

857
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,063
(groans)

858
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:07,286
NUN: Oh, oh, Mother, an evil...

859
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,746
(background chatter)

860
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,836
(man and woman shouting
through walls)

861
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:19,839
(click)

862
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:31,519
(shouting grows louder)

863
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:35,022
(door opens)

864
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,274
(door slams loudly)

865
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:38,651
(door opens)

866
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:41,404
(footsteps receding)

867
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,252
(door closes)

868
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,756
(tense music)

869
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:02,800
(quiet chatter)
(papers shuffling)

870
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:20,026
(in Italian): The results
of the second ballot are...

871
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:24,030
Cardinal Adeyemi,
34 votes.

872
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:28,242
Cardinal Tedesco,
25 votes.

873
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:33,080
Cardinal Bellini,
18 votes.

874
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:38,002
Cardinal Tremblay,
16 votes.

875
00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:39,753
(furnace door closes)

876
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,049
Cardinal Lawrence, 9 votes.

877
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:47,178
Cardinal Benitez, 2 votes.

878
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,346
(chatter, murmuring)

879
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:59,065
My brothers, in accordance with
the Apostolic Constitution,

880
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:03,110
we proceed immediately
to the next vote.

881
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:04,236
Thank you.

882
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,366
(ballot clangs)

883
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:10,492
(lid clinks)

884
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:15,998
The results of
the third ballot are...

885
00:56:16,457 --> 00:56:20,211
Cardinal Adeyemi,
52 votes.

886
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:24,340
Cardinal Tedesco,
30 votes.

887
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:27,718
Cardinal Tremblay,
10 votes.

888
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:30,221
Cardinal Bellini...

889
00:56:30,346 --> 00:56:31,514
(rumbling)

890
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:35,392
(loud chatter)

891
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:44,692
Brothers.

892
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:46,277
Please.

893
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:48,530
Thank you.

894
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:53,911
Cardinal Bellini, 9 votes.

895
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:57,623
Cardinal Lawrence, 5 votes.

896
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:01,794
Cardinal Benitez, 4 votes.

897
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:03,587
(siren blaring distantly)

898
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:05,631
(birds tweeting)

899
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:11,679
(siren grows louder)
(nuns chattering)

900
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:21,998
(in English): Well, I take it
something has happened.

901
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,583
There's been an explosion, Your Eminence,

902
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:24,942
in the Piazza Barberini.

903
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:27,611
- A bomb?
- It's unclear at the moment.

904
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:30,281
There are injuries, but no talk
of fatalities.

905
00:57:31,574 --> 00:57:32,950
We must say nothing to
the cardinal

906
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:34,201
electors about this, Ray.

907
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:35,536
We are sequestered,

908
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,788
and they must be shielded
from all news

909
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:39,498
that may influence
their judgement.

910
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,126
- You understand?
- Of course, Your Eminence.

911
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,672
(footsteps receding)

912
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:48,257
(dark music)

913
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:51,427
(loud chatter)

914
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:55,723
This is exactly what I mean.

915
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:57,516
What am I supposed to tell them in Milan

916
00:57:58,017 --> 00:58:01,854
when they start to discover our
new Pope's social views?

917
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:04,982
Tell your congregation that
they should celebrate

918
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:08,527
the first African Pope in
the history of the church.

919
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,405
If Adeyemi was white,

920
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:13,532
we would be all condemning him

921
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,534
as more reactionary
than Tedesco?

922
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:16,845
It's only because he's
not white...

923
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:18,662
It's too late for all that.

924
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:19,580
It's too late.

925
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:20,705
(men shouting angrily)

926
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:21,957
(clattering)

927
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:24,919
(chair scrapes)
(woman sobs)

928
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:26,795
(footsteps receding)

929
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:29,757
What happened?

930
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:34,303
(clattering, clanging)
(steam hissing)

931
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,603
(sharp rapping on door)

932
00:58:49,068 --> 00:58:51,153
(door opens)
Good afternoon, Sister.

933
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:54,240
I would like to speak to the nun
who dropped her tray just now.

934
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:56,343
She's safe with me, I'm dealing
with the situation, Dean.

935
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:59,787
I'm sure you are, Sister Agnes,
but I must see her myself.

936
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:01,914
I hardly think a dropped tray should concern

937
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,083
the Dean of the College
of Cardinals.

938
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,209
Even so, I...

939
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:06,502
The welfare of the sister

940
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:07,836
is my responsibility.

941
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:10,005
And this Conclave is mine.

942
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,969
(bird tweets)
(door opens)

943
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:19,722
(door closes)

944
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:23,352
Please sit, my child.

945
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:28,983
My name is Cardinal Lawrence.

946
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:30,150
How are you feeling?

947
00:59:30,276 --> 00:59:31,402
She's feeling much better.

948
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:33,028
Could you tell me your name?

949
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:35,239
Shanumi, her name is Shanumi.

950
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:37,283
Please, please do sit down.

951
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:38,760
I... I really think it would
be better

952
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:40,327
if you let me deal with
the situation.

953
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:43,247
Would you be so good as to
leave us now, Sister Agnes?

954
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:52,381
(footsteps receding)

955
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:53,506
(door opens)

956
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:56,718
(door closes)

957
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,222
(chair trundles)

958
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:07,563
Sister Shanumi,

959
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:10,858
I want you to understand that,
first of all,

960
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:13,569
you are not in any
kind of trouble.

961
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:15,404
The fact of the matter is that I have

962
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,156
a responsibility before God

963
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:20,159
to ensure that the decisions
that we make here

964
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:22,119
are the right ones.

965
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:26,999
Now, it's important you tell me
anything that is in your heart

966
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:28,417
or that is troubling you,

967
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:32,129
insofar as it relates to
Cardinal Adeyemi.

968
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:34,715
(bird tweets)

969
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,050
Can you do that for me?

970
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:42,431
Even if I give you my assurance

971
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,850
it will go no further than
this room.

972
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,033
Would you like me to hear your
confession?

973
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:06,872
(knocking loudly)

974
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,290
(footsteps approaching)

975
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,461
(door opens)

976
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:13,962
I'll be ready in a moment, Dean.

977
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:17,216
(footsteps receding)

978
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:24,348
(door closes, locks)

979
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:27,017
(tap running)
(footsteps approaching)

980
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:38,566
(Adeyemi clears his throat)

981
01:01:43,826 --> 01:01:44,618
Shouldn't we be going?

982
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:46,120
In a moment.

983
01:01:46,245 --> 01:01:47,287
That sounds ominous.

984
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:54,685
If this is about the incident
downstairs,

985
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:56,296
I have no desire to
talk about it.

986
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:00,258
(sighs)

987
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:02,678
I am the victim of
a disgraceful plot

988
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,346
to ruin my reputation.

989
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:08,225
Someone brought that woman here
and staged this melodrama.

990
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:09,893
She'd never left Nigeria
before,

991
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:12,396
and suddenly she's here
in the Casa Santa Marta.

992
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:14,398
With respect, Joshua,
ow she came here

993
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:15,858
is secondary to the issue

994
01:02:15,983 --> 01:02:17,609
of your relationship with her.

995
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,404
I have no relationship to her!

996
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,991
I hadn't set eyes on her
in 30 years

997
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:26,076
until she turned up
outside my room last night!

998
01:02:27,453 --> 01:02:28,453
(frustrated sigh)

999
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:33,917
It was a lapse, Dean.

1000
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:36,794
A lapse.

1001
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:42,342
'Let God grant us a Pope who
sins and asks forgiveness

1002
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:43,552
and carries on.'

1003
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:45,220
- Your words.
- And the child?

1004
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:47,138
The child?

1005
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:49,975
(scoffs)

1006
01:02:56,607 --> 01:02:58,942
The child was raised in
a Christian household,

1007
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:01,278
and to this day he has no idea
who his father is,

1008
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:02,821
if, indeed, it is me.

1009
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,365
That is the child.

1010
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:09,286
We were very young.

1011
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:11,079
No, no, no, Joshua,

1012
01:03:11,205 --> 01:03:14,374
she was very young,
she was 19 years old.

1013
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,959
You were 30.
- Thomas.

1014
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:17,919
Thomas.

1015
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,297
Listen to me... please.

1016
01:03:23,175 --> 01:03:25,302
I sensed the presence of
the Holy Spirit this morning,

1017
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:26,427
I swear it.

1018
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:29,890
I am ready to take this burden.

1019
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:34,394
Do... does a single...
single mistake 30 years ago

1020
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,729
disqualify me?

1021
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,775
Thomas, please, I was
a different man.

1022
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:44,738
Please, I... I beg you, do... do
not use this to ruin me.

1023
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:46,865
Joshua, that thought's not
worthy of you.

1024
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,660
Shanumi will say nothing to
protect her son,

1025
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,704
and I am bound
by the vows of the confessional.

1026
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,124
(Adeyemi exhales)

1027
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,251
So, I still have hope?

1028
01:03:58,085 --> 01:03:59,085
No.

1029
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:04,925
There is no hope.

1030
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:08,029
After such a public scene,
there will be rumours,

1031
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:10,264
and you know
what the Curia is like.

1032
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:11,974
Nothing terrifies our colleagues more

1033
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:16,186
than the thought of yet more...
sexual scandals.

1034
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:20,482
I am more sorry than I can say.

1035
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:24,027
You will never be Pope.

1036
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:25,487
(sobs)

1037
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:30,701
You must begin again.

1038
01:04:33,579 --> 01:04:35,998
But you are a good man.

1039
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:37,165
(sobbing)

1040
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,085
I know you to be a good man,

1041
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:42,504
and you will find a way
to atone.

1042
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:45,841
(sobbing)

1043
01:05:03,609 --> 01:05:06,153
ADEYEMI: Will you pray with me?
(sobs)

1044
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:08,488
(sombre music)

1045
01:05:08,614 --> 01:05:09,906
Yes, of course.

1046
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:16,163
(sobbing)

1047
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:37,726
(sobbing)

1048
01:05:58,497 --> 01:05:59,790
(urn clangs)

1049
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:27,567
(tense music)

1050
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:31,613
(in Italian): The results of
the fifth ballot are...

1051
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:35,909
Cardinal Tremblay, 40 votes.

1052
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,163
Cardinal Tedesco,
34 votes.

1053
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:44,668
Cardinal Bellini,
13 votes.

1054
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:49,297
Cardinal Lawrence, 11 votes.

1055
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:54,136
Cardinal Adeyemi, 9 votes.

1056
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:58,265
Cardinal Benitez, 6 votes.

1057
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:00,308
(loud murmuring)

1058
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:02,269
My brothers...

1059
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:05,731
My brothers, that concludes
the fifth ballot.

1060
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:09,985
No candidate having achieved
the necessary majority,

1061
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:13,280
we shall resume voting
tomorrow morning.

1062
01:07:26,752 --> 01:07:27,753
(clears throat)

1063
01:07:28,587 --> 01:07:29,587
(in English): Yes, Ray?

1064
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,966
The... incident this morning,
Your Eminence.

1065
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:34,843
I have more information, if...

1066
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:37,471
No, I too must be shielded from
any knowledge

1067
01:07:37,596 --> 01:07:39,598
which could act as
an interference

1068
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,433
in the process of this Conclave.

1069
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:42,809
Of course, Your Eminence.

1070
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:44,852
Anything else?

1071
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:45,896
Erm...

1072
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:49,399
Oh, Cardinal Benitez...
who has health problems?

1073
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:51,985
He was issued a round-trip
ticket to Geneva

1074
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:55,655
paid for by
the Pope's own account.

1075
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:57,783
I checked his visa application,

1076
01:07:57,908 --> 01:08:01,203
the purpose for travel was
given as 'medical treatment'.

1077
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:05,040
Anyway, whatever it was,
it can't have been serious.

1078
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:06,725
The ticket was cancelled,
he never went.

1079
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:08,418
Alright. Thank you.

1080
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:18,011
Forgive me, Your Eminence.

1081
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:22,390
I know you said we should
forget about the matter

1082
01:08:22,516 --> 01:08:24,976
of the withdrawn report.

1083
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,770
But I... I wondered...

1084
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:31,358
in light of Cardinal Tremblay's
current position...

1085
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:35,070
I... I could see if I could
find out...

1086
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:36,780
No, I'm not a witch-finder.

1087
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:38,907
It's not my job to go hunting
for secrets

1088
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:40,367
in my colleagues' pasts.

1089
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:47,206
Forgive me.

1090
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,169
Please, no more investigations,
I...

1091
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,673
I think we've heard enough
secrets.

1092
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,638
Let God's will be done.

1093
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:04,057
Yes, of course.

1094
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:05,934
Goodnight then, Your Eminence.

1095
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:08,270
(footsteps recede)

1096
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:23,993
(knock on door)

1097
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:30,125
Was this really necessary?

1098
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,002
I feel as if I'm at some

1099
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:34,129
American political convention.

1100
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,631
Well, it isn't going to
take long.

1101
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:39,134
Our friend here doesn't have sufficient support

1102
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:41,219
amongst our colleagues to be
elected Pope.

1103
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:42,344
It isn't over yet.

1104
01:09:42,429 --> 01:09:43,305
Well, I'm afraid,

1105
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,056
as far as I'm concerned, it is.

1106
01:09:46,975 --> 01:09:49,269
So, now the question arises,

1107
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:50,979
if I can't win,

1108
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:55,150
whom do I advise
my supporters to vote for?

1109
01:09:57,903 --> 01:09:58,903
Thomas,

1110
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,488
I am no more an enthusiast

1111
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:02,198
for Tremblay than you are.

1112
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:05,493
But... we have to face the fact
that...

1113
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:07,996
(clanging, gate squeaks open)

1114
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:10,290
(footsteps echoing)

1115
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,379
(door opens)

1116
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:18,715
(door closes)

1117
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,717
We have to face the fact

1118
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:23,053
that he has demonstrated broad
appeal.

1119
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:27,182
Maybe he'll be a unifying force.

1120
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:29,768
- What?
- Is this what we're reduced to,

1121
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:33,897
considering the least
worst option?

1122
01:10:34,022 --> 01:10:35,523
But the field has narrowed.

1123
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,693
If we don't change our vote,
we will be here for weeks.

1124
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:40,946
And that's exactly what
Tedesco wants.

1125
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:42,989
We've had a Pope who was
in the Hitler Youth

1126
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:44,324
and fought for the Nazis.

1127
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:45,742
We've had Popes accused of

1128
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:48,411
colluding with communists
and fascists.

1129
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:50,538
We've had Popes who have
ignored reports

1130
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:52,791
of most appalling sexual abuse
of children!

1131
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,334
Shh. Okay. Shh-shh!

1132
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,544
We take the point.

1133
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:59,631
The point is we will never
find a candidate

1134
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:03,134
who doesn't have any kind of
black mark against them.

1135
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,220
We're mortal men.

1136
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:06,680
We serve an ideal.

1137
01:11:07,639 --> 01:11:09,766
We cannot always be ideal.

1138
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:17,774
Then we're agreed.

1139
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:21,778
We urge all our supporters to
back Tremblay.

1140
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:24,863
Good.

1141
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:29,119
(footsteps receding)
(door opens)

1142
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:35,375
The other night, you were
kind enough

1143
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,460
to say that
you had voted for me.

1144
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:40,630
Now, I don't know if you've
continued to do so,

1145
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:45,010
but if you have, then I must
repeat my plea to you to stop.

1146
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:47,512
Why?

1147
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:50,515
Well, firstly, I lack the
spiritual depth

1148
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,683
to be Pope.

1149
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:54,561
Secondly,
I couldn't possibly win.

1150
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:56,521
A long, drawn-out Conclave

1151
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,606
would be seen by the media
as proof

1152
01:11:58,732 --> 01:12:00,984
that the Church is in crisis.

1153
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:03,361
You have come to ask me to vote
for Cardinal Tremblay?

1154
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:06,364
Yes, I have, and to urge your
supporters to do the same.

1155
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:09,200
Cardinal Tremblay already spoke
to me about this.

1156
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,785
Oh, well, I'm sure he has.

1157
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:13,997
You want me to vote for a man
you see as ambitious?

1158
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:18,835
I do not want to see Tedesco
as Pope.

1159
01:12:19,461 --> 01:12:22,672
He would take our church back
to... to an earlier era.

1160
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:25,216
I'm sorry, but I cannot vote
for a man

1161
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,927
unless I deem him
the most worthy to be Pope.

1162
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,930
And for me, that is not
Tremblay.

1163
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:32,723
It's you.

1164
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,935
I don't want your vote!

1165
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:38,521
Nevertheless... you have it.

1166
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:45,819
(blows softly)

1167
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:48,323
(footsteps recede)

1168
01:12:48,448 --> 01:12:50,033
(tense, high tempo music)

1169
01:13:11,638 --> 01:13:14,516
Sister Shanumi is on her way
home to Nigeria.

1170
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:17,936
There was a flight to Lagos
this evening,

1171
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:21,147
and I thought it was best for
everyone if she was on it.

1172
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:24,526
How did Sister Shanumi come to
be in Rome?

1173
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,654
I received notification from
the office

1174
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:31,032
of the Superioress General that
she would be joining us.

1175
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:33,701
The arrangements were made
in Paris.

1176
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:35,328
You should Rue de Bac,
Your Eminence.

1177
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:37,080
I would, except of course, I am

1178
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:39,666
sequestered for the duration of
the Conclave.

1179
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:41,835
Then you should ask them
afterwards.

1180
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:47,006
Err, the information is of value
to me now.

1181
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:54,722
Sister Agnes, I know that you
were close to the Holy Father.

1182
01:13:55,807 --> 01:13:58,393
When I tried to resign as Dean,
he wouldn't let me.

1183
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:02,647
I couldn't understand why at
the time, but...

1184
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:04,440
now I think I do.

1185
01:14:06,568 --> 01:14:08,820
I think the Holy Father knew
he was dying,

1186
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:13,992
and for some reason he wanted me
to run this Conclave.

1187
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:16,327
Which is what I'm trying to do.

1188
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:20,747
For him.

1189
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:37,265
(taps on keyboard)

1190
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:48,985
(door opens)

1191
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:52,739
(door closes)

1192
01:14:52,864 --> 01:14:54,073
(bird twittering)

1193
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:56,951
(chair trundles)

1194
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:06,211
(mouse clicking)

1195
01:15:17,764 --> 01:15:18,932
(dark music)

1196
01:15:19,057 --> 01:15:20,725
I would like you to withdraw
your name

1197
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:21,893
from the next ballot.

1198
01:15:22,477 --> 01:15:23,561
(laughs)

1199
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,480
You are not the right man
to be Pope.

1200
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:27,315
Er, well...

1201
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,441
40 of our colleagues

1202
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:29,793
would disagree with you on that.

1203
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:31,903
That's because they don't know
you as I do.

1204
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:35,448
This is sad, Thomas.

1205
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:38,243
I shall pray for you.

1206
01:15:38,368 --> 01:15:39,661
I know there was some kind of

1207
01:15:39,786 --> 01:15:41,120
report into your activities.

1208
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,664
I know the Holy Father raised the matter with you

1209
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:44,749
hours before he died.

1210
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,918
And that he dismissed you
from all your posts.

1211
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:49,045
And I know that somehow
you discovered

1212
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:52,131
Adeyemi's surrender to
temptation 30 years ago,

1213
01:15:52,257 --> 01:15:54,092
and that you arranged for
the woman involved

1214
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:55,260
to be brought to Rome,

1215
01:15:55,385 --> 01:15:56,511
with the express intention

1216
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:58,596
of destroying Adeyemi's chances

1217
01:15:58,721 --> 01:15:59,721
of becoming Pope.

1218
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:01,015
I deny that accusation.

1219
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,893
Will you deny asking our
Superioress to transfer

1220
01:16:04,018 --> 01:16:05,395
one of her sisters to Rome?

1221
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,855
- No. I asked her.
- Hmm.

1222
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:10,221
- But not on my own behalf.
- Well, on whose behalf then?

1223
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:11,526
The Holy Father's.

1224
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:14,028
You would libel the Holy Father in his own home?

1225
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:17,156
It isn't libel, it's the truth!

1226
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:20,326
The Holy Father gave me
the name of a sister

1227
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:23,663
and asked me to make a private
request to bring her to Rome.

1228
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:25,790
I have no idea why.

1229
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,875
And now you have chosen to...

1230
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:30,378
(sinister music)

1231
01:16:31,713 --> 01:16:33,339
You should be careful, Thomas.

1232
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:38,720
Your own ambition has not
gone unnoticed.

1233
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:43,850
This might be seen as a tactic
to blacken the name of a rival.

1234
01:16:43,975 --> 01:16:45,601
Well, that's a despicable
accusation.

1235
01:16:45,727 --> 01:16:46,727
Is it?

1236
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:48,812
I wonder...

1237
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:53,735
if you really are so
very reluctant

1238
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:56,362
to have the chalice
passed to you.

1239
01:17:01,326 --> 01:17:04,370
I shall pretend this
conversation never took place.

1240
01:17:05,413 --> 01:17:06,998
(sinister music continues)

1241
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,083
(footsteps recede)

1242
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,127
But it has taken place!

1243
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:16,924
(sinister beat)

1244
01:17:21,012 --> 01:17:22,388
(sinister beat repeated)

1245
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:23,513
(bell chimes)

1246
01:17:28,603 --> 01:17:29,729
(intercom announcement)

1247
01:17:31,356 --> 01:17:33,149
(Lawrence breathes heavily)

1248
01:17:47,622 --> 01:17:49,457
(sinister, high tempo music)

1249
01:17:56,214 --> 01:17:58,049
(music grows in intensity)

1250
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:00,343
(snapping)

1251
01:18:03,221 --> 01:18:04,430
(ribbon pulling)

1252
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:13,356
(door closes)

1253
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:18,860
(light switch clicks)

1254
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:28,246
(sinister music)
(drawer opens)

1255
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:38,047
(drawer closes)

1256
01:18:47,849 --> 01:18:48,975
(clasp clicks)

1257
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:01,946
(pill bottle rattles)

1258
01:19:11,706 --> 01:19:12,999
(book flips open)

1259
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:21,966
(mutters)

1260
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:25,553
(intercom announcement repeats)

1261
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:36,564
(slight gasp)

1262
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:38,858
(treacherous music)

1263
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:43,571
(fearful breathing)

1264
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:48,367
(high tempo music)

1265
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:02,465
(treacherous music)

1266
01:20:23,361 --> 01:20:24,904
(door rattles)
(high tempo beat)

1267
01:20:32,537 --> 01:20:33,704
(sinister music)

1268
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:38,209
(footsteps receding)

1269
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:46,842
(door opens)

1270
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:53,432
(light switch clicks)

1271
01:20:57,478 --> 01:20:58,771
(wardrobe doors open)

1272
01:21:05,236 --> 01:21:06,654
(deep sigh)

1273
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:09,282
(wardrobe doors close)

1274
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:22,545
(footsteps pacing)

1275
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,115
(sobbing)

1276
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:03,919
(sobbing grows louder)

1277
01:22:15,306 --> 01:22:16,974
(uninhibited crying)

1278
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:42,249
(treacherous beat)

1279
01:22:53,678 --> 01:22:55,054
(rattling)

1280
01:22:56,597 --> 01:22:57,597
(click)

1281
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,192
(ominous music continues)

1282
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:27,795
LAWRENCE: It's the report on
the activities of Tremblay.

1283
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,881
It's an overwhelming prima
facie case that he is guilty

1284
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,217
of simony, which, of course,
is an offence stipulated

1285
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:35,237
in the Holy Scriptures...
- I'm aware of what simony is,

1286
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:36,381
thank you.
- He only obtained

1287
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:37,823
all those votes
in the first ballot

1288
01:23:37,847 --> 01:23:39,014
because he bought them.

1289
01:23:39,974 --> 01:23:42,935
Cardenas, Diene, Figarella,
Baptiste...

1290
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:45,730
And all this in the last twelve months

1291
01:23:45,855 --> 01:23:47,648
when he must have
guessed the Holy Father's

1292
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:49,692
pontificate was... was coming
to an end.

1293
01:23:49,817 --> 01:23:51,610
How do we know that this money
wasn't used

1294
01:23:51,736 --> 01:23:53,863
for completely
legitimate purposes?

1295
01:23:53,988 --> 01:23:55,990
Because I have seen their bank
statements.

1296
01:23:58,701 --> 01:24:00,061
- Dear God.
- Seems the Holy Father

1297
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:01,746
was spying on all of us.

1298
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:05,040
He didn't trust anyone.

1299
01:24:06,834 --> 01:24:08,127
Where did you get this?

1300
01:24:10,171 --> 01:24:11,255
You broke the seals.

1301
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,840
I felt I didn't have a choice.

1302
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:14,592
I suspected Tremblay
of bringing

1303
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:17,720
that poor woman from
Africa to embarrass Adeyemi.

1304
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:20,973
You must continue with your
candidacy, Aldo.

1305
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:22,308
(papers rustle)

1306
01:24:26,771 --> 01:24:27,771
Put them back.

1307
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:34,445
Put them back, or burn them,
or... just... put them back.

1308
01:24:34,904 --> 01:24:37,198
I could never become Pope in
these circumstances.

1309
01:24:37,323 --> 01:24:39,742
A stolen document, the smearing
of a brother cardinal.

1310
01:24:39,867 --> 01:24:41,827
I'd be the
Richard Nixon of Popes.

1311
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:43,579
Then stay clear of this,
leave it to me.

1312
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:45,414
I'm willing to handle
the consequences.

1313
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:47,374
You know who's gonna benefit
most from this?

1314
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,002
Tedesco.

1315
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:52,004
The whole basis of his
candidacy

1316
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:55,424
is that the Holy Father
led the church to disaster

1317
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:57,259
by his attempts at reform.

1318
01:24:57,384 --> 01:24:59,178
If you reveal this report,

1319
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:02,014
it isn't Tremblay's reputation
that's going to suffer,

1320
01:25:02,473 --> 01:25:03,557
it's the Church's.

1321
01:25:04,809 --> 01:25:08,479
Accusing the Curia of
institutional corruption...

1322
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:11,982
I thought we were here to serve
God, not the Curia.

1323
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,651
Oh, don't be naïve!

1324
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:17,904
(sighs)

1325
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,115
Put them back.

1326
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:24,787
And have Tremblay as Pope?

1327
01:25:24,912 --> 01:25:25,996
We've had worse.

1328
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,121
(door opens)

1329
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:33,170
What has he offered you?

1330
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:36,632
Secretary of State?

1331
01:25:42,972 --> 01:25:46,475
Five times I cast my vote
for you, Aldo.

1332
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:49,353
But I was wrong.

1333
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:53,274
You lack the courage required
to be Pope.

1334
01:25:57,695 --> 01:25:58,988
(door opens)

1335
01:26:00,698 --> 01:26:02,324
(door closes)
(shutters whirring)

1336
01:26:05,536 --> 01:26:06,536
(beep)

1337
01:26:08,289 --> 01:26:09,289
(sighs)

1338
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:10,416
(dark, high tempo music)

1339
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:12,918
SISTER AGNES: I will do that
for you, Your Eminence

1340
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:14,879
Oh.

1341
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:16,671
(lid creaks open)

1342
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,090
(lid bangs shut)

1343
01:26:20,426 --> 01:26:22,136
How many copies do you require?

1344
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:24,305
Er, 108.

1345
01:26:29,018 --> 01:26:30,394
(copier whirring)

1346
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:40,195
(music intensity rises)

1347
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,618
You are responsible for this,
I believe.

1348
01:26:45,743 --> 01:26:46,743
(chatter)

1349
01:26:46,785 --> 01:26:48,662
No, Eminence. You are.

1350
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:49,914
(sudden silence)

1351
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:54,084
This report is entirely
mendacious.

1352
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:55,878
It would never have seen
the light of day

1353
01:26:56,003 --> 01:26:57,755
if you had not broken into

1354
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:00,007
the Holy Father's apartment to
remove it!

1355
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:01,383
If the report is mendacious,

1356
01:27:01,508 --> 01:27:02,968
then why did the Holy Father

1357
01:27:03,093 --> 01:27:04,970
in his last official act as Pope

1358
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,263
ask you to resign?

1359
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:07,806
He did no such thing.

1360
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:10,588
(stammers) As Monsignor Morales,
who was at the meeting...

1361
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:13,520
And yet Archbishop Wozniak
insists the Holy Father...

1362
01:27:13,646 --> 01:27:14,646
The Holy Father,

1363
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,940
may his name be numbered

1364
01:27:16,065 --> 01:27:17,232
among the high priests,

1365
01:27:17,358 --> 01:27:21,028
was a sick man toward
the end of his life,

1366
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:25,157
as those of us who saw him
regularly can attest.

1367
01:27:25,282 --> 01:27:26,617
(laughter)

1368
01:27:26,951 --> 01:27:29,536
(in Italian): If I may join
this amiable dialogue.

1369
01:27:29,662 --> 01:27:31,080
I want to remind you that

1370
01:27:31,205 --> 01:27:34,667
the names of eight cardinals
have been obscured.

1371
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:39,088
I assume the dean can tell us
who they are?

1372
01:27:39,213 --> 01:27:40,798
Let them tell us themselves

1373
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:42,341
here and now.

1374
01:27:42,925 --> 01:27:44,343
Here and now!

1375
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:47,012
(in English): If Cardinal Tremblay
requested their votes

1376
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:48,430
in return for the money...

1377
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:49,915
(in Italian): No, I won't do that.

1378
01:27:49,974 --> 01:27:51,350
(cardinals shouting)

1379
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:54,895
(in English): Let each man examine his
conscience, as I have.

1380
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:59,650
I have no desire to create
bitterness in this Conclave,

1381
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:02,444
and I will be happy to stand
down as Dean.

1382
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:04,154
(loud, clamorous shouting)

1383
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:17,042
(room grows quiet)
(helicopter whirrs outside)

1384
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:18,167
Eminences.

1385
01:28:19,378 --> 01:28:22,172
Although we sisters are
supposed to be invisible,

1386
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:26,927
God has nevertheless given us
eyes and ears.

1387
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:29,013
I know what prompted the Dean
of the College

1388
01:28:29,138 --> 01:28:32,558
to enter
the Holy Father's rooms.

1389
01:28:32,683 --> 01:28:35,019
He was concerned that
the sister from my order

1390
01:28:35,144 --> 01:28:37,896
that made that regrettable scene

1391
01:28:38,022 --> 01:28:39,857
might have been brought to Rome

1392
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:42,067
with the deliberate intention

1393
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:45,404
of embarrassing a member of
this Conclave.

1394
01:28:46,572 --> 01:28:48,449
His suspicions were correct.

1395
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:52,327
She was indeed here at
the specific request

1396
01:28:52,453 --> 01:28:53,954
of Cardinal Tremblay.

1397
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:56,165
(stunned silence)

1398
01:29:02,755 --> 01:29:04,006
(footsteps receding)

1399
01:29:13,432 --> 01:29:14,432
My brothers...

1400
01:29:15,809 --> 01:29:16,809
it's true.

1401
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,981
But the Holy Father asked me to.

1402
01:29:22,608 --> 01:29:25,360
I had no knowledge

1403
01:29:25,486 --> 01:29:27,529
who this woman was,
I swear to you.

1404
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:33,994
(in Italian): Judas.

1405
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:35,788
Traitor.

1406
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:39,208
(footsteps receding)

1407
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:40,876
(quiet whispering)

1408
01:29:54,098 --> 01:29:55,432
(footsteps approaching)

1409
01:30:06,777 --> 01:30:09,137
(in English): It seems that
we're running out of favourites.

1410
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:14,743
You must take over
the supervision

1411
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:16,245
of this election, Aldo.

1412
01:30:17,788 --> 01:30:18,872
Oh, no thank you.

1413
01:30:19,248 --> 01:30:20,249
(laughs ironically)

1414
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:23,418
You are steering this Conclave.

1415
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:27,422
Exactly where, I do not know.

1416
01:30:28,382 --> 01:30:31,260
But that firm hand of yours
has its admirers.

1417
01:30:37,224 --> 01:30:40,435
Thomas I've come to ask...
for your forgiveness.

1418
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:46,400
I had the temerity...

1419
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:50,988
to tell you to examine...
your heart,

1420
01:30:51,113 --> 01:30:53,198
when all the time it was
my own that...

1421
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:00,789
It's shameful...

1422
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:06,461
to be this age
and still not know yourself.

1423
01:31:06,587 --> 01:31:09,464
Ambition, 'The moth of
holiness.'

1424
01:31:13,594 --> 01:31:14,720
I'm sorry.

1425
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,520
So, perhaps it's time you
decided... upon a name.

1426
01:31:26,231 --> 01:31:28,358
As the next most senior member
of this Conclave,

1427
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:30,152
it will fall to me to ask you

1428
01:31:30,277 --> 01:31:32,070
how you wish to be known
as Pope.

1429
01:31:34,948 --> 01:31:36,283
For better or for worse,

1430
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:38,118
it would seem that Tremblay
is finished.

1431
01:31:40,579 --> 01:31:42,748
This is a contest between
Tedesco and you.

1432
01:31:43,165 --> 01:31:44,917
You're the only one who can
stop him now.

1433
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:54,133
John.

1434
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:57,596
I would choose John.

1435
01:31:58,931 --> 01:32:00,474
(soft music)

1436
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:12,402
(breathing heavily)

1437
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:46,019
(pen scratches)

1438
01:33:31,398 --> 01:33:32,607
(urn lid clinks)

1439
01:33:33,317 --> 01:33:35,944
(ballot clangs)
(deafening blast)

1440
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:37,738
(shouting)

1441
01:33:37,863 --> 01:33:39,448
(rubble crashing)

1442
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:49,166
(dramatic music)

1443
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:57,716
(laboured breathing)

1444
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:32,000
(footsteps approaching)

1445
01:34:33,585 --> 01:34:34,812
O'MALLEY: Everyone has been taken back

1446
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:35,962
to the Casa Santa Marta,

1447
01:34:36,088 --> 01:34:37,172
Your Eminence.

1448
01:34:37,297 --> 01:34:38,337
No one was seriously hurt.

1449
01:34:38,382 --> 01:34:39,508
Some cuts, that's all.

1450
01:34:41,093 --> 01:34:43,553
Outside in the city,
how bad is it?

1451
01:34:57,567 --> 01:34:58,735
Oh, dear God.

1452
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:05,700
At 11:20 this morning,

1453
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:10,122
a car bomb exploded in
the Piazza del Risorgimento.

1454
01:35:10,455 --> 01:35:13,667
Shortly afterwards, as people
were fleeing the scene,

1455
01:35:14,251 --> 01:35:17,170
an individual with explosives
strapped to his body

1456
01:35:17,295 --> 01:35:18,755
detonated himself.

1457
01:35:19,256 --> 01:35:23,218
There are reports of further
attacks in Louvain and Munich.

1458
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:26,263
The current death toll stands...

1459
01:35:27,514 --> 01:35:28,598
at 52.

1460
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:29,850
(murmuring)

1461
01:35:30,308 --> 01:35:31,935
Hundreds have been injured.

1462
01:35:32,936 --> 01:35:33,936
(in Italian): Well, then.

1463
01:35:34,354 --> 01:35:38,942
Here at last we see the result of
the doctrine of relativism

1464
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:42,320
so beloved by our liberal
brothers!

1465
01:35:44,281 --> 01:35:48,702
A relativism that sees all
faiths and passing fancies

1466
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:50,954
accorded equal weight.

1467
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:53,290
So that now, when we look
around us, we see the homeland

1468
01:35:53,415 --> 01:35:55,208
of the Holy Roman
Catholic Church

1469
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:58,712
dotted with the mosques
and minarets

1470
01:35:58,837 --> 01:35:59,963
of the prophet Muhammad!

1471
01:36:00,088 --> 01:36:01,566
(in English): You should be ashamed ashamed.

1472
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:02,590
Ashamed. Ashamed.

1473
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:04,301
We should all be ashamed!

1474
01:36:04,426 --> 01:36:08,513
(in Italian): We tolerate Islam in our land,

1475
01:36:08,889 --> 01:36:10,390
but they revile us in theirs.

1476
01:36:10,515 --> 01:36:13,810
We nourish them
in our homelands.

1477
01:36:14,728 --> 01:36:16,062
But they exterminate us.

1478
01:36:16,188 --> 01:36:19,232
How long will we persist in
this weakness?

1479
01:36:19,357 --> 01:36:21,902
They are literally at our walls
right now.

1480
01:36:22,027 --> 01:36:25,238
What we need now is a leader
who understands

1481
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:29,117
that we are facing
a true religious war.

1482
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:30,785
Do not touch me!

1483
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:34,247
Yes, a religious war.

1484
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:37,292
We need a leader who will
put a stop to the drift

1485
01:36:37,417 --> 01:36:40,295
that has gone on almost ceaselessly
for the past 50 years.

1486
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:42,589
How long will we have to
persist in this weakness,

1487
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:43,714
how long?

1488
01:36:43,757 --> 01:36:45,800
We need a leader...

1489
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:48,512
(in English):...who fights these animals!

1490
01:36:48,637 --> 01:36:50,347
(loud chatter)

1491
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:56,811
CARDINAL: Is this the man you
want to lead us?

1492
01:37:00,982 --> 01:37:02,400
My brother cardinal...

1493
01:37:02,526 --> 01:37:03,985
(room falls silent)

1494
01:37:09,491 --> 01:37:10,951
With respect.

1495
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:14,663
What do you know about war?

1496
01:37:18,333 --> 01:37:21,169
I carried out my ministry
in the Congo.

1497
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:23,088
In Baghdad, in Kabul.

1498
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:27,842
I've seen the lines of the dead
and wondered,

1499
01:37:27,968 --> 01:37:29,803
Christian and Muslim.

1500
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:35,559
Would you say we have to fight?

1501
01:37:36,935 --> 01:37:38,728
What is it you think
we're fighting?

1502
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:41,606
Do you think it's those
deluded men

1503
01:37:41,731 --> 01:37:44,609
who had carried out these
terrible acts today?

1504
01:37:46,111 --> 01:37:47,153
No, my brother.

1505
01:37:48,113 --> 01:37:50,113
(in Spanish): The thing you're fighting is here...

1506
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:53,451
inside each and every one of us,

1507
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:56,496
if we give in to hate now,

1508
01:37:58,248 --> 01:37:59,833
if we speak of "sides"

1509
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:02,752
instead of speaking
for every man and woman.

1510
01:38:05,088 --> 01:38:07,340
This is my first time here, amongst you,

1511
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:09,676
and I suppose it will be my last.

1512
01:38:12,095 --> 01:38:17,309
Forgive me, but these last few days
we have shown ourselves to be small petty men,

1513
01:38:19,561 --> 01:38:21,855
we have seemed concerned
only with ourselves,

1514
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:24,356
with Rome,

1515
01:38:24,816 --> 01:38:26,568
with these elections, with power.

1516
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:30,780
But things are not the Church.

1517
01:38:32,866 --> 01:38:34,534
The Church is not tradition.

1518
01:38:35,619 --> 01:38:37,329
The Church is not the past.

1519
01:38:39,873 --> 01:38:42,417
The Church is what we do next.

1520
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:44,002
(dramatic music)

1521
01:38:55,263 --> 01:38:57,557
(dramatic, high tempo music)

1522
01:39:03,021 --> 01:39:04,397
(quiet chatter)

1523
01:39:37,389 --> 01:39:38,598
(dramatic music continues)

1524
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:51,486
(rain falling)

1525
01:40:16,678 --> 01:40:17,846
(in Latin): We pray.

1526
01:40:17,971 --> 01:40:22,100
O Father, so that we may guide

1527
01:40:22,225 --> 01:40:25,645
and watch over Your Church.

1528
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:27,480
Give to us, Your servants,

1529
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:31,317
the blessings of intelligence,
truth and peace,

1530
01:40:31,735 --> 01:40:35,989
so that we may strive to know
Your will,

1531
01:40:36,114 --> 01:40:40,076
and serve You
total dedication.

1532
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:44,998
For Christ our Lord.

1533
01:40:45,123 --> 01:40:46,416
ALL: Amen.

1534
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,771
(breeze blowing softly)

1535
01:41:31,002 --> 01:41:33,254
(ballots rustling)
(pens scratching)

1536
01:41:41,888 --> 01:41:43,223
(tense, dramatic music)

1537
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:51,856
(quiet whispering)

1538
01:42:20,218 --> 01:42:21,469
Bellini.

1539
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:28,768
Lawrence.

1540
01:42:31,813 --> 01:42:33,147
Tedesco.

1541
01:42:35,358 --> 01:42:36,734
Lawrence.

1542
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:45,034
(applause)

1543
01:43:32,582 --> 01:43:34,208
(room falls silent)
(dramatic beat)

1544
01:43:35,835 --> 01:43:41,132
(in Italian): Do you accept your canonical
election as Supreme Pontiff?

1545
01:43:49,724 --> 01:43:55,605
Do you accept your canonical
election as Supreme Pontiff?

1546
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:04,154
I accept.

1547
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:05,323
(gasps, sighs)

1548
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:09,452
And by what name do you
wish to be called?

1549
01:44:14,582 --> 01:44:16,000
Innocent.

1550
01:44:19,337 --> 01:44:20,880
(whispering)

1551
01:44:24,217 --> 01:44:26,344
(resounding applause)

1552
01:44:45,571 --> 01:44:47,573
(faint choral singing)

1553
01:44:49,242 --> 01:44:50,702
Monsignor.

1554
01:44:51,035 --> 01:44:53,204
(in English): I'm sorry to interrupt.

1555
01:44:54,205 --> 01:44:55,205
Ray...

1556
01:44:57,667 --> 01:44:59,877
I think you should gather
up the cardinals' notes.

1557
01:45:00,003 --> 01:45:01,254
The sooner we light the stove,

1558
01:45:01,379 --> 01:45:02,579
the sooner the world will know

1559
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:03,715
we have a new Pope.

1560
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:07,844
What is it?

1561
01:45:09,929 --> 01:45:10,972
It wasn't...

1562
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:13,766
wasn't the outcome I expected.

1563
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:15,852
No, but it's wonderful
all the same.

1564
01:45:17,937 --> 01:45:19,415
If it's my position you're
worried about,

1565
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:21,816
I can reassure you I feel
nothing but relief.

1566
01:45:22,984 --> 01:45:25,069
Our new Holy Father will make
a much better Pope

1567
01:45:25,194 --> 01:45:26,696
than I would ever have done.

1568
01:45:33,036 --> 01:45:35,830
I wonder if I could have a word
in private.

1569
01:45:38,416 --> 01:45:40,960
I should have told you this
morning when I found out, but...

1570
01:45:42,045 --> 01:45:43,045
with everything that...

1571
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:45,048
And I didn't dream

1572
01:45:45,173 --> 01:45:47,050
that Cardinal Benitez would
become...

1573
01:45:47,175 --> 01:45:49,594
Ray, please, tell me what's
troubling you.

1574
01:45:52,555 --> 01:45:53,723
I found out...

1575
01:45:54,682 --> 01:45:55,682
Switzerland.

1576
01:45:56,559 --> 01:45:58,686
Cardinal Benitez's trip
to Switzerland.

1577
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:01,689
Switzerland, the... the hospital
in Geneva, yes?

1578
01:46:03,566 --> 01:46:05,026
It wasn't a hospital.

1579
01:46:05,818 --> 01:46:06,986
It was a clinic.

1580
01:46:10,156 --> 01:46:11,532
A clinic for what?

1581
01:46:13,868 --> 01:46:15,536
(chatter)

1582
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:23,169
(rapping hard on door)

1583
01:46:24,087 --> 01:46:25,087
(door opens)

1584
01:46:25,171 --> 01:46:27,465
(in Italian): Eminence,
His Holiness won't get robed.

1585
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:28,590
With permission.

1586
01:46:34,222 --> 01:46:35,848
(in English): May I speak to you alone?

1587
01:46:35,973 --> 01:46:36,973
{\an8}Of course.

1588
01:46:37,058 --> 01:46:38,898
(in Italian): Gentlemen, let's clear the room.

1589
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:41,020
(footsteps receding)

1590
01:46:41,145 --> 01:46:42,145
(heavy doors close)

1591
01:46:46,442 --> 01:46:48,402
(in English): I was waiting for you to come.

1592
01:46:48,528 --> 01:46:50,238
You must tell me about
this treatment

1593
01:46:50,363 --> 01:46:51,948
at the clinic in Geneva.

1594
01:46:53,491 --> 01:46:55,159
- Must I, Dean?
- Yes, you must.

1595
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:58,579
Within the hour you will be the
most famous man in the world,

1596
01:46:58,704 --> 01:47:03,209
so please tell me,
what is your... situation?

1597
01:47:05,169 --> 01:47:07,171
My situation, as you put it,

1598
01:47:08,047 --> 01:47:10,466
is the same as when I was
ordained a priest,

1599
01:47:11,551 --> 01:47:13,469
and when I was made a cardinal.

1600
01:47:13,594 --> 01:47:15,805
But the treatment... in Geneva?

1601
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:17,348
There was no treatment.

1602
01:47:18,141 --> 01:47:19,600
I considered it.

1603
01:47:19,725 --> 01:47:21,936
I prayed for guidance and decided against it.

1604
01:47:22,061 --> 01:47:24,397
But what would it have been,
this treatment?

1605
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:30,361
It was called a laparoscopic
hysterectomy.

1606
01:47:44,083 --> 01:47:45,751
(footsteps pacing)

1607
01:48:03,895 --> 01:48:05,771
(long, deep sigh)

1608
01:48:17,325 --> 01:48:18,951
You have to understand,

1609
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:24,665
when I was a child, there was
no way of knowing my situation

1610
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:26,250
was more complicated.

1611
01:48:28,169 --> 01:48:30,338
And life in the seminary is...

1612
01:48:30,463 --> 01:48:31,589
as you know,

1613
01:48:31,714 --> 01:48:33,216
a very modest one.

1614
01:48:35,801 --> 01:48:37,053
The truth is...

1615
01:48:37,386 --> 01:48:38,846
there simply was no reason
to think

1616
01:48:38,971 --> 01:48:40,011
I was physically different

1617
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:41,349
from the other young men.

1618
01:48:42,934 --> 01:48:45,061
Then, in my late 30s,

1619
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:49,565
I had a surgery to remove
my appendix.

1620
01:48:51,192 --> 01:48:53,402
And that was when the doctors
discovered...

1621
01:48:54,362 --> 01:48:57,782
that I had a uterus...
and ovaries.

1622
01:48:59,158 --> 01:49:00,493
Some would say

1623
01:49:00,618 --> 01:49:03,871
my chromosomes would define
me as being a woman,

1624
01:49:05,122 --> 01:49:06,624
and yet I'm also...

1625
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:08,668
as you see me.

1626
01:49:20,221 --> 01:49:22,598
It was a very dark time for me.

1627
01:49:22,723 --> 01:49:24,684
I felt as if my entire life as a priest

1628
01:49:24,809 --> 01:49:26,936
had been lived in
a state of sin.

1629
01:49:28,729 --> 01:49:31,732
Of course, I offered my
resignation to the Holy Father.

1630
01:49:32,233 --> 01:49:34,485
I flew to Rome and I told him
everything.

1631
01:49:37,154 --> 01:49:38,239
He knew?

1632
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:42,285
Yes, he knew.

1633
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:44,328
And he thought it acceptable
for you

1634
01:49:44,453 --> 01:49:47,164
to continue as
an ordained minister?

1635
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:52,044
We considered surgery to remove
the female parts of my body,

1636
01:49:52,169 --> 01:49:54,797
but the night before I was due
to fly,

1637
01:49:54,922 --> 01:49:56,841
I realised I was mistaken.

1638
01:49:58,092 --> 01:50:00,303
I was who I had always been.

1639
01:50:02,763 --> 01:50:04,390
It seemed to me more of a sin

1640
01:50:04,515 --> 01:50:07,810
to change His handiwork than
to leave my body as it was.

1641
01:50:10,521 --> 01:50:13,274
So, you are still, erm...

1642
01:50:15,318 --> 01:50:16,986
I am what God made me.

1643
01:50:18,946 --> 01:50:22,950
And perhaps it is my difference
that will make me more useful.

1644
01:50:25,453 --> 01:50:27,204
I think again of your sermon.

1645
01:50:29,582 --> 01:50:32,585
I know what it is to exist...

1646
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:35,171
between the world's certainties.

1647
01:50:50,895 --> 01:50:52,855
(distant choral music)

1648
01:51:25,304 --> 01:51:26,514
(clanging)

1649
01:51:28,474 --> 01:51:29,975
(lighter flicks)
(flame flares)

1650
01:51:30,810 --> 01:51:31,852
(switch clicks)

1651
01:51:32,812 --> 01:51:33,896
(button clicks)

1652
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:36,690
(loud murmuring)

1653
01:51:38,317 --> 01:51:39,527
(whoosh)

1654
01:51:43,781 --> 01:51:45,699
(footsteps crunching)

1655
01:51:50,996 --> 01:51:52,289
(water babbling gently)

1656
01:51:54,667 --> 01:51:56,210
(distant choral music)

1657
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:59,088
(uproarious cheering, applause)

1658
01:52:10,975 --> 01:52:12,435
(pensive music)

1659
01:52:17,231 --> 01:52:18,399
(crowd cheering distantly)

1660
01:52:42,214 --> 01:52:43,507
(click, shutters whirring)

1661
01:52:51,557 --> 01:52:52,558
(distant talking)

1662
01:52:55,853 --> 01:52:56,853
Hmm.

1663
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:00,691
(curtain swishes)

1664
01:53:01,108 --> 01:53:02,109
(window handle rattles)

1665
01:53:02,234 --> 01:53:03,444
(ambient street sounds)

1666
01:53:20,377 --> 01:53:21,962
(nuns chattering)

1667
01:53:39,438 --> 01:53:40,438
(window squeaks closed)
