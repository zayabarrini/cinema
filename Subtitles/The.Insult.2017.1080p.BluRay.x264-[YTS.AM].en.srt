1
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,556
If they ask you

2
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,600
who's your President,

3
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,904
tell them our President
is Bachir Gemayel.

4
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,869
<i>May the Lord be with you.</i>

5
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,696
The Christian Party...

6
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,752
The Christian Party...

7
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,379
is like the Bible.

8
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,749
You know, in the Bible,

9
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,467
there's the Old Testament,

10
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,052
and the New Testament.

11
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,721
In the past, we used to say,

12
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,055
only the Christian Party
protects Beirut.

13
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,805
Today, what do we say?

14
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:51,101
The Christian Party supports the State!

15
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,386
You should have seen him today,

16
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,805
he was shining bright.

17
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,182
I see him every day, thank God.

18
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,143
I'd like to take the photo down.

19
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,265
Why?

20
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,735
I feel like
I'm under 24-hour surveillance, Tony.

21
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,356
What if he moved in with us?

22
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:42,152
Great. Why not?

23
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,246
It gets very hot, 9 months a year.

24
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,581
Do you want the AC on?

25
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,416
I'd like to move out.

26
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,165
We're going to name you Streeda.

27
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,891
I want a bigger, quieter place
for the baby.

28
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,594
Shirine, we already talked about this.

29
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,563
We're saving to buy this place.

30
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,850
I work here.

31
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,736
Darling,

32
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,106
let's move to Damour.

33
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,067
You have a family house there.

34
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,116
Many people have returned.
They're rebuilding.

35
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,831
The church is restored and blessed...

36
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,291
I'm fine here!

37
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,382
Shirine, come have a cup of coffee.

38
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,759
NeXt time. Thank you.

39
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,732
I need a rear shaft for a BMW 325.

40
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,904
How much?

41
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,072
$40.

42
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,161
I'll send you Eli.

43
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,372
Eli,

44
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,875
it's missing the stamp.

45
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,085
How shall I file this?

46
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,457
I looked everywhere.
Only found it in the suburbs.

47
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,710
Total pain in the ass.

48
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,836
Checkpoints everywhere.

49
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,136
Your transmission is worn out.
The clutch is slipping.

50
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,678
I just had them replaced.

51
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,975
They can't even get the name right.
The S is missing.

52
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,182
It's totally worn out.

53
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,815
Used German is better
than brand new Chinese.

54
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,655
I want those guys to finish the job,
not sluff off.

55
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,870
Get rid of this cable.

56
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,414
Have them move faster.

57
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,875
Why is it like this?

58
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,920
I want him on the 4th floor.
I talked to the neighbors.

59
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,755
<i>- Yasser.</i>
- Go ahead.

60
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,251
<i>The cement truck is here.</i>

61
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,676
Park it on the street
and pour the concrete 8 cm thick.

62
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,219
<i>A car is blocking the street.</i>

63
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,520
<i>Boss! Do you copy?</i>

64
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,743
There's a problem with your gutter.
We need to look at it.

65
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,375
What kind of problem?

66
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,246
People are getting sprayed.

67
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,425
Use the other side of the street.

68
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,930
What's going on?

69
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,520
Fucking prick!

70
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,527
Mr. Tony,

71
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,110
from what I understand,

72
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,323
your drainpipe was sticking out,
he was trying to fiX it,

73
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,332
but you broke it.

74
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,497
That's my balcony, my house.

75
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,797
City Hall asked us
to fix all building violations.

76
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,712
Your drainpipe is illegal.
He's only doing his job.

77
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,710
That's no reason to insult me.

78
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,428
Of course not.

79
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,923
He thinks he's a hotshot.
He's not!

80
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,550
I'm warning you,
he'd better apologize,

81
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,644
or I'll sue him and your company.

82
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,809
No need for that, Mr. Tony.

83
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,107
Let me take care of this.

84
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,484
I'll get your drain fiXed.

85
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,569
No one fiXes anything.

86
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,114
We're in their neighborhood.

87
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,616
We can't talk to them like that.

88
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,365
We have to put up with them.

89
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,330
He wants you to apologize.

90
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,718
He's waiting.
Do it, then fix his drainpipe.

91
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,381
Yes.

92
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,926
When will you finish?

93
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,763
In two months.
That's why I hired Yasser.

94
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,347
He gets the job done.

95
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,516
He has a tough job.

96
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,856
He's a bit moody.

97
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,856
He gets carried away,
but he's harmless.

98
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,234
You know, life has become difficult.

99
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,156
People are angry.

100
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,249
That's why we should put things
in perspective.

101
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,043
Tell Mr. Tony that Yasser is sorry.

102
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,175
And he presents his apologies.

103
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,883
Thank you. You shouldn't have.

104
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,099
It's nothing.
I hope he likes chocolate.

105
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,348
A boy or a girl?

106
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,804
Girl.

107
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,315
When is she due?

108
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,900
End of summer.

109
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,735
September 28.

110
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,696
Perfect. The weather will be cooler.

111
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,202
- How much steel for this wall?
- Half a ton.

112
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,366
Why?

113
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,114
It's 3 meters thick.

114
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,410
Come in.

115
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,085
Mr. Tony, please wait.

116
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,598
- I thought we'd solved this.
- No, we didn't.

117
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,470
You spoke to my wife.
Did you expect she'd finesse me?

118
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,016
I looked for you.

119
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,764
The chocolate wasn't his idea.

120
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,937
It came from all of us.
So what?

121
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,901
Don't try to walk all over us!

122
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,019
What do you mean?

123
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,523
I asked for an apology!
He should have done it!

124
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:21,365
Mr. Tony, some people find it
difficult to apologize.

125
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,364
It doesn't mean
they don't recognize their errors.

126
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,205
<i>Because of their corrupt leadership,</i>

127
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:38,048
<i>the Palestinians have become
despised everywhere.</i>

128
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,424
<i>Let them find another land</i>

129
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,051
<i>to live in,</i>

130
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,052
<i>other than Lebanon.</i>

131
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,102
<i>Let them establish their own state,</i>

132
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:53,233
<i>let them rule themselves,</i>

133
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,604
<i>let them scatter in the Arab world.</i>

134
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,565
<i>They may unite with Jordan,</i>

135
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,068
<i>they may run to Iran,</i>

136
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,903
<i>as long as</i>

137
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,614
<i>they don't stay here.</i>

138
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,338
How's work?

139
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:19,211
Great. Norway donated a generator
for the school.

140
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,962
In Norway, if you choose to live
1,000 miles away,

141
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:26,137
the State provides you
power, water, internet, gas.

142
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,351
We're a long way from Norway.

143
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,684
It's getting complicated.

144
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,566
He's not willing to let go.

145
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,691
If he files a complaint,
I'll have to report it.

146
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,859
I don't want to,
and you know why.

147
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,986
What complaint?

148
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,534
What happened?

149
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,738
A misunderstanding with a tenant.
Nothing serious.

150
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,871
If the cops intervene,
it'll be a problem.

151
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,664
I want to resolve this.

152
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,754
What's going on?

153
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,418
It's about a gutter.

154
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,759
Your husband goes to fix it,
the tenant breaks it.

155
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:04,301
He gets water on your husband,
who calls him a fucking prick.

156
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,094
The tenant wants an apology.

157
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,885
Which came first:
the gutter or the prick?

158
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,137
That's not the issue right now.

159
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,975
My husband is fair.

160
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,649
Your husband got carried away.

161
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,235
I want to resolve this thing.

162
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,153
I want you to apologize.

163
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,272
You hear me?

164
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,570
Listen, Yasser,

165
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,778
we're asked to rebuild
the refugee camp up north.

166
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,325
It's two years of work.

167
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,284
Let's not screw this up
over a few stupid words.

168
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,209
Because that's what they are,
just stupid words.

169
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,342
Tomorrow morning. We go together.

170
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,884
Tomorrow is Sunday.

171
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,803
He's open on Sunday.

172
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,402
He's going out on a limb for you.

173
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,651
What shall I do, bend over?

174
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,995
Show some appreciation.

175
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,615
I'm nobody's servant!

176
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,366
That's selfish.

177
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,751
The world's not plotting against you.

178
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,587
We are targeted.

179
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,252
- Who's we?
- Me, you, all of us.

180
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,751
We're the niggers of the Arab world.

181
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,421
Did your boss plot against you?

182
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,718
Did Norway plot against you?

183
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,100
Norway?
Did you meet someone?

184
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,555
You wish.

185
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,429
Well, move to fucking Norway.
I'm not stopping you.

186
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,431
If I go, I take you with me.

187
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,476
You insulted a man.
Now fix it.

188
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,071
You love your work, you're happy.

189
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,028
Don't let this spoil everything.

190
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,546
<i>In your name,</i>

191
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,170
<i>in the name of the people
of Tarshish and Antura,</i>

192
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,419
<i>the people of Damour,</i>

193
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,717
<i>ofAshieh...</i>

194
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,637
Hello, Mr. Tony.

195
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,765
Can you come outside, please?

196
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,479
What for?

197
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,816
There's been a misunderstanding,

198
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,777
I'd like us to turn the page.

199
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,030
You keep saying misunderstanding.

200
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,870
<i>So they don't end up
like the Palestinian refugee,</i>

201
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:38,117
<i>wandering the world,
ruining everything in his path,</i>

202
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,754
<i>drinking from our wells
then spitting in it...</i>

203
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,465
I'm asking you personally.

204
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,923
He's waiting for you.

205
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,296
<i>Why do we pursue</i>

206
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,422
<i>our struggle?</i>

207
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,559
<i>Why do we still need
the Lebanese resistance</i>

208
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,595
<i>and the Christian Party?</i>

209
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,224
<i>Why do we see casualties every day?</i>

210
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,311
<i>Why are we being forced</i>

211
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,857
<i>to put order in the house?</i>

212
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,944
<i>And to put a stop</i>

213
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,408
<i>to the abuse?</i>

214
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,246
<i>Because two-thirds of this country
are still occupied.</i>

215
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,082
<i>Two-thirds of our villagers</i>

216
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,542
<i>are now refugees.</i>

217
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,719
Mr. Tony wants to turn the page.

218
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,713
He wants to hear it from you.

219
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,815
You know what?

220
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,980
You people are lousy bastards.

221
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:51,282
Otherwise, you would've apologiZed.
That explains your bad reputation.

222
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,741
As the Jews say,

223
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,533
"Palestinians never miss
an opportunity to miss an opportunity."

224
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,712
Yasser, what's wrong with you?

225
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,085
You want to get fired?

226
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,875
I'll do it.

227
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,343
I swear.

228
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,303
I wish Ariel Sharon
had wiped you all out!

229
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,202
Two broken ribs. What happened?

230
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,866
Someone hit him,

231
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,864
about a stupid gutter.

232
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:41,990
Breathe in.

233
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,955
We're looking for that animal.

234
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,796
- When we catch him...
- Not now, Eli.

235
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,541
Don't lift anything for 8 weeks.

236
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,919
Shall I put you on sick leave?

237
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,715
Keep the ice pack on,
and get some rest.

238
00:16:58,976 --> 00:16:59,932
Get well.

239
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,016
A Christian suing a Palestinian?

240
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,185
No lawyer will take this case.

241
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,479
No one would dare.

242
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,524
I don't need a lawyer.
I know I'm right.

243
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:12,988
No, you're not.

244
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,277
You're not right at all.

245
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,447
What you said is unacceptable.
That's how wars start.

246
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,410
Dad, are you saying he's right?

247
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,700
I'm saying you're wrong.

248
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,450
He just wanted to fix your gutter,
but you humiliated him.

249
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,451
You're blaming me for a gutter?

250
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,750
They fucked up this country,
and you blame me for a gutter?

251
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,796
Tell me why can't you go in there?

252
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:34,839
That's how it is.

253
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,884
We aren't authorized
to enter Palestinian camps.

254
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,551
What authority do you have?

255
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:40,799
It's political.

256
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,847
How do you get him out?

257
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,311
You bait him?

258
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,097
He must be in there hiding.

259
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,020
Then he'll be deemed a fugitive,

260
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,439
and an arrest warrant will be issued.

261
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,983
You said you can't arrest him!
What a joke!

262
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,732
It's the hideout of every convict.

263
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,575
Please, let me finish.

264
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,694
If it were me, I'd be in jail.

265
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,529
But him,

266
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,997
we arrest him by mail.

267
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,832
Because he's Palestinian!

268
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,292
This is bullshit!

269
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,047
You insulted the police.

270
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,170
No, I insulted the situation.

271
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,639
- "I wish Ariel Sharon..."
- What's the problem?

272
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,881
How could you?

273
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,930
To a Palestinian?

274
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,428
- You don't understand.
- I don't?

275
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:32,481
It's normal for you, but not for me.
You think it's a perfect world?

276
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,273
Is it because of the baby?

277
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,112
I don't want her to suffer.

278
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,230
Me neither.

279
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,575
But we're stuck,
and you don't want to change.

280
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,842
Hello.

281
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,308
I'll be gone for a few days.

282
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,897
Continue working as usual.

283
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:16,737
Close the sewers on Fassouh Street
and level out the concrete.

284
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,652
No problem.

285
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,487
How are you, boss?

286
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,243
He asked for it.

287
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:42,800
Here.

288
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,720
Can you feel it?

289
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,812
You think she knows what's going on?

290
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,682
I don't know.

291
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,731
I think she knows everything.

292
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,356
She knows when we're happy,

293
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,982
when we're sad,

294
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,701
when we're angry.

295
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,125
You think she can hear us?

296
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,167
I think so.

297
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,801
Right, Streeda?

298
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,399
Can I help you?

299
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,198
I'm Yasser Salameh.

300
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,408
I'm turning myself in.

301
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,711
Drop your case.

302
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,002
He gets out of jail
and everything will be fine.

303
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,472
- You still defend him.
- Because he's a decent man.

304
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,595
He doesn't deserve this.

305
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,681
He doesn't belong in jail.

306
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,731
We don't solve this thing
by pretending we love each other.

307
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,520
That's not how it works.

308
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,769
It could.

309
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,151
I'm no Jesus Christ
who'll turn the other cheek.

310
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:46,045
Case Number 23:
Tony Hanna vs Yasser Salameh.

311
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,686
Are you the plaintiff,
Tony George Hanna, Lebanese,

312
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,805
born October 7, 1970?

313
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:57,772
Yes.

314
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,184
You reside in Beirut.

315
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,025
Yes.

316
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,359
Bring in the accused.

317
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,376
Are you Yasser Abdallah Salameh,

318
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,754
born June 16, 1955 in Palestine?

319
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:29,629
Yes.

320
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,382
- What ID do you have?
- A laissez-passer.

321
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:33,554
Where do you reside?

322
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,017
St. Eli Refugee Camp.

323
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,598
You don't want an attorney?

324
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,058
No.

325
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,852
Mr. Tony,

326
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:44,941
you claim that on July 2,
Mr. Salameh insulted you.

327
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,280
A week later, at 8:30 AM,

328
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,241
he assaulted you at your garage
and broke two ribs.

329
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,075
Yes.

330
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,911
You're suing for physical
and moral damages.

331
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:54,745
Yes.

332
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,865
How much are you claiming?

333
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,745
- What do you mean?
- What's the amount you want?

334
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,086
The court will say.

335
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,917
You're also asking for "acknowledgment".

336
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,133
Can you explain?

337
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,299
I want him to acknowledge
that he erred.

338
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:11,922
- And I...
- The court decides.

339
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,300
I want him to say he's sorry,
hear it out of his mouth.

340
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:17,935
Why don't you have a lawyer?

341
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,395
Because I'm right.

342
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,562
Just because you say so
doesn't mean it's true.

343
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,809
Mr. Yasser,

344
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,691
how do you plead?

345
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,860
Guilty, not guilty,
guilty with an explanation?

346
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,285
Guilty.

347
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,700
Your Honor, can I talk to Mr. Yasser?

348
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,164
Are you his lawyer?

349
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,157
His employer.

350
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,375
- Please sit.
- He doesn't know the laws.

351
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:42,790
I said sit down.

352
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:45,918
Mr. Yasser,

353
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,838
by pleading guilty,
you consent to the crime.

354
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,092
Yes.

355
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:55,432
I was watering my plants as usual,

356
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,927
I didn't notice he was under my balcony.
Suddenly I heard...

357
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:03,273
Why didn't you look down
to check if anyone was underneath?

358
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,522
Didn't you know
your installation was illegal?

359
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,691
- Every flat is like that.
- Answer me.

360
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,193
Did you know it was illegal?

361
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,691
No, I didn't.

362
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,534
When the company
informed you that it was,

363
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,450
and sent someone to fix it,
why did you refuse?

364
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:21,074
I didn't want workers in our home.
My pregnant wife was alone.

365
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,296
Did you have other problems
in your home?

366
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,542
- A wiring problem two months ago.
- What did you do?

367
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,636
I called an electrician.
It was the fuse box.

368
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,800
Is the fuse box in your apartment?

369
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:35,797
Yes.

370
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,721
So the electrician went
inside your apartment.

371
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:39,801
Correct.

372
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,475
When he came in, was your wife alone?

373
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,106
Yes, but we...

374
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,770
Thank you, Mr. Tony.

375
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,853
Mr. Yasser,

376
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:53,278
you've been renovating buildings there
for five weeks now.

377
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,115
Yes.

378
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,155
- How do residents treat you?
- Well.

379
00:24:56,578 --> 00:25:01,494
You know that in this town,
every area has its own sensibilities,

380
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,912
political, religious.

381
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,331
Have you taken this into account?

382
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,874
- Yes.
- How?

383
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,000
I asked my workers
to pray in a car park,

384
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,586
to offend no one.

385
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,931
The fight with Mr. Tony
is the first one you've had.

386
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:18,798
Yes.

387
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,217
So why

388
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,138
after five weeks of friendly relations,

389
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,312
did you call Mr. Hanna
a "fucking prick"?

390
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,354
He spilled dirty water on me.

391
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,986
He says it was an accident.
How do you answer to this?

392
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,281
I've done nothing wrong
eXcept do my job.

393
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,904
Why didn't you apologize?

394
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:42,872
He gave you ample time to do it.

395
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,122
I didn't feel I owed him an apology.

396
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,204
So on July 9,

397
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,629
you go to his garage and punch him.

398
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,381
This is premeditated assault.

399
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,513
I was going to apologize.

400
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,223
What changed your mind?

401
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,393
Please answer, what stopped you?

402
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,479
I already said I was guilty.

403
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,975
I need to know
what pushed you to hit him.

404
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:11,943
The report doesn't say why.

405
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,107
He said things.

406
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,107
Like what?

407
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,998
You're doing yourself no favor
by remaining silent.

408
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,371
The allegations against you are serious.

409
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,135
What pushed him to hit you?

410
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,552
He was asked first.

411
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,517
I'm addressing you now.

412
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,474
If my words were bad,
then let him repeat them.

413
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,767
What did you say?

414
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,644
He had no right to hit me.

415
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,476
You must have said something
that pushed him.

416
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,192
If you won't say it,
you admit he didn't deserve it.

417
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,031
I don't believe it all started
over a gutter.

418
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,248
This is the last time I will ask.

419
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,625
Mr. Tony.

420
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,328
Mr. Yasser.

421
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,002
Very well.

422
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,961
This court finds

423
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:20,754
all the evidence presented
is inconclusive.

424
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,051
Inconclusive?
What about my injuries?

425
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,515
Do not interrupt me.

426
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,009
You can't lump us together.

427
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,011
Don't tell me what I can't do!

428
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,309
Nothing justifies physical assault!

429
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:31,727
Says who?

430
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,853
Article 554 of the penal code:

431
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:40,232
"Aggravated assault is defined
by serious bodily injury..."

432
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,733
I know what the law says.

433
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:46,329
"... and carries a sentence of 6 months
and a fine of up to 50,000 pounds."

434
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,663
Mr. Tony, please.

435
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,828
- "In case it leads to illness...
- Mr. Tony!

436
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,702
- You've crossed the line.
- This is the law.

437
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:56,081
You broke the law
by having an illegal pipe

438
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,298
and breaking it after he fixed it.

439
00:27:58,552 --> 00:27:59,633
Case dismissed!

440
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,513
- Not fair, Your Honor!
- You may go, Mr. Yasser.

441
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,553
You're biased.
You're acquitting a criminal.

442
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,766
Leave the courtroom.

443
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,886
Not before I get a fair trial.

444
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,139
Get out or I'll have you arrested.

445
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,480
For what?

446
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:14,520
Get him out!

447
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,526
You're a corrupt judge and a fraud.

448
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,447
I will sue you.

449
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,691
You're hurting him!

450
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,818
I'll have you barred from this court

451
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,786
and from every other court!

452
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,574
It pays to be Palestinian!

453
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,455
It pays to be Palestinian!

454
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,920
You weren't expecting it.

455
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,928
Since neither of you told the judge
the whole truth.

456
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,223
The truth is I hit someone
because of an insult.

457
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,598
If it were that simple,
you'd still be in jail.

458
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:40,944
The judge was biased.
It's just that it was in my favor.

459
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:45,235
No, he understood
it was about more than a gutter.

460
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,571
How could you say that to the judge?

461
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,164
He was a biased judge.

462
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,953
Appeal, but don't insult judges.

463
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,126
They're all in cahoots.

464
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,372
The Palestinian was gloating
the whole time.

465
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,497
I didn't see that.

466
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,124
You were sitting in the back.

467
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,297
He didn't tell the judge what you said!

468
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,217
Because he had the verdict
in the pocket.

469
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,308
People who get humiliated
end up hating themselves.

470
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,093
What are you saying?

471
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,013
Tomorrow we get into an argument,

472
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,856
I beat the shit out of you,

473
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,441
I smash your brain,

474
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,310
but it's OK since I hate myself?

475
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,654
- I dare you.
- Manner of speaking.

476
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,865
Never talk to me like this!
I don't care how bad you feel.

477
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:29,700
Manner of speaking!

478
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,447
Boss, screw the courts.

479
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:36,120
They bribed him.
Bunch of pricks!

480
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,663
There's a witch-hunt against Christians.

481
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,128
You weren't even born yet.
So shut up.

482
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,906
Take photos of this place
from different angles.

483
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,660
Send them to the Mayor
in a golden frame.

484
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,878
For the press,

485
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,293
"Ibrahim Nassar Construction Company

486
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,169
"serves this community

487
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:33,218
"by removing violations
and improving infrastructures, etc."

488
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,761
Yes, Mr. Deputy.

489
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,180
Good work, Talal.
It's looking fine.

490
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,518
Thank you.

491
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:39,933
But,

492
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,106
why are we using Italian paint?

493
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,522
The local brand peels off when it rains.

494
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,862
The Italian has a 10-year warranty.

495
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,197
Mix it.

496
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,526
It will void the warranty, sir.

497
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,293
Who is he?

498
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,386
The foreman.

499
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,427
Palestinian.

500
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,592
I know, it's illegal.

501
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,605
You know where I stand on this issue.

502
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,688
I'm with their cause.
I share their grief.

503
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,143
I know.

504
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,604
But not at the firm's expenses.

505
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,812
Court date is set for August 3.

506
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,183
Judge Colette Mansur will preside.

507
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,980
I hope the court's AC is working.

508
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:02,825
The doctor is preparing his report
on the Hannas and their daughter.

509
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,528
- He'll have to state...
- No, "to prove".

510
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,499
To prove that their complications
are the consequence...

511
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,038
No, the "direct consequence"
of the assault.

512
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,413
Choose your words carefully,
this is the appeal phase.

513
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,666
Mr. Tony Hanna is here.

514
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:21,843
Hello.

515
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,182
We heard about your day in court.

516
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,428
- What you told the judge was ballsy.
- I got carried away.

517
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,272
How could you not?
An injustice was committed.

518
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,150
But do me a favor,

519
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:39,103
never go to court
without a lawyer.

520
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,230
I didn't want to sue, counselor.

521
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,323
All I wanted was an apology.

522
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,862
And he refused.

523
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:48,955
You gave him ample time to apologize,
and he beat you up.

524
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,493
That's unacceptable.

525
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,414
He beat up a Lebanese citizen.
We cannot accept that.

526
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,250
He pleaded guilty.

527
00:36:57,507 --> 00:37:01,126
To get an acquittal.
Those people are sneaky, deceitful.

528
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:04,546
They know how to turn the tables round.

529
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:07,093
Aggressors paint themselves as victims,

530
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,512
and you know who they learn it from.

531
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,637
I did certain things
that I shouldn't have.

532
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,896
I poured water on him.

533
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,940
I went to my garage,

534
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,897
I carried heavy things...

535
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,144
Mr. Tony,

536
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,943
you came to me, right?

537
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,110
Yes.

538
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,986
So please, let's focus on that.

539
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,571
I want a fair trial, counselor.

540
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,664
I don't want to win by sympathy.

541
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:36,832
Do you think Wajdy Webb wins cases
by sympathy?

542
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,459
Jessica.

543
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,291
We're suing for pain and suffering,

544
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,010
yours, your wife's, and your daughter's.

545
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:49,132
We'll ask for $80,000 in damages
and $40,000

546
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,224
for moral damages.

547
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,306
I don't care about money.

548
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,104
What do you care about?

549
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,563
When we're done with him,

550
00:37:56,816 --> 00:38:00,059
I want him to say
I'm 100 times worse than Ariel Sharon.

551
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,694
Let me ask you a question,

552
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,531
why did you say, "I wish Ariel Sharon
had wiped you all out?"

553
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:07,775
What's the big deal?

554
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,870
If the judge asks you,
how will you answer?

555
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,072
It felt right to say it.

556
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:17,247
That's not a good argument.
Those words are loaded, Mr. Tony.

557
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:20,338
What you said is very compleX.

558
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,706
I don't understand.

559
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:25,459
The Palestinian cause is
a whole different ball game.

560
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,135
There's the UN, the NGOs,
the humanitarian organizations...

561
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,178
Everyone roots for the Palestinians.

562
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,888
And don't forget,

563
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,977
there are those who hate us.

564
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,393
The Left, the liberals.

565
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,523
By the way, many are Christians.

566
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:45,818
They'd all be willing to skydive
just to defend Yasser Salameh.

567
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,236
It's trendy to defend those people.

568
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,201
So even if your opponent
wants to settle out of court,

569
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,740
they may force him not to.

570
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,989
My daughter is on life support,

571
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,414
She can't breathe on her own.
We don't know if she'll make it.

572
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,411
My wife is also...

573
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,373
I want you to think carefully
about what you said.

574
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:07,752
That's what they'll focus on in court,

575
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,972
not who spilled water, who beat whom,
or who's the fucking prick,

576
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:15,559
but why you said, "I wish Ariel Sharon
had wiped you all out."

577
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,353
Mr. Yasser, what I'd like to know

578
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,194
is why you didn't tell the judge
what your opponent said?

579
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,196
My husband isn't a snitch.

580
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,149
No one will judge your integrity
in a court.

581
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,776
I called him a fucking prick.

582
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:17,155
You can't compare prick
with Sharon wiping you all out.

583
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,747
He said, "I wish".

584
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,036
What's the difference?

585
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:24,037
He could have said: wiped you out,
beat you up, or loved you.

586
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:25,629
They're just words.

587
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,756
So why were you upset?

588
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,048
Those words change everything.

589
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,513
They insult your nationality
and identity.

590
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,632
It could be considered a hate crime.

591
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:39,101
Everyone hates and insults everybody.

592
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:43,143
Insulting someone's identity
is punishable by law.

593
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,935
It means you can sue him.

594
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,058
But I hit him.

595
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,730
Because of what he said.

596
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,775
Plus, he asked you to apologize.
You went to do that.

597
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,364
He's got a problem with me.

598
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,826
According to Article 228
of the penal code,

599
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:06,545
even if a perpetrator exceeds
the bounds of self-defense,

600
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,962
he may be acquitted
if he acted in extreme distress

601
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,547
that hampered
his judgment and self-control.

602
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,841
Forget my distress.

603
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,222
His child is fighting for her life.

604
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,808
That's why you need a lawyer.

605
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,391
I can't afford you.

606
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,472
Your opponent is appealing

607
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,443
for his and his wife's
health complications.

608
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:33,315
If his baby dies,
that's involuntary manslaughter.

609
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,735
We're looking at ten years.

610
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,369
You can manage this situation
or let it manage you.

611
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,864
Either way, you have little time.
Please think about it.

612
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,997
Why are you doing this?

613
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,961
Because you people
are often deprived of your rights.

614
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,292
Not now.

615
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,505
I'm sorry for everything.

616
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,091
Enough of your bullshit.

617
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,836
We were fine
until you barged into our neighborhood.

618
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,929
- I understand.
- You understand nothing!

619
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:42,175
We want to cover your hospital bills,

620
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,768
and do repairs to your home,
anything we can help...

621
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,637
And how will that save my daughter?

622
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:47,934
How?

623
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,059
You think you can buy us with flowers

624
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,901
and a boX of chocolate?

625
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,440
Of course not.

626
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:58,115
Tell your fucking deputy
we're not for sale.

627
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,198
I want those people out of my life.

628
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,243
Wajdy Webb has the case. We'll win.

629
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,911
I don't care who wins.

630
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,457
You let a stupid incident
take hold of you.

631
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,579
I won't drop the case. Never.

632
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,459
You go to court, you win,
the guy gets life. Then what?

633
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,836
- That's a lot already.
- And your baby?

634
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,339
- What about her?
- Did you ask her what she wants?

635
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,635
It's for her.

636
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,555
I'm doing this for you, for the family.

637
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,974
You're doing it for yourself!

638
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:31,186
You'll burn everything
but not turn the page!

639
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,606
You know what?
I hope you get what you want.

640
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,696
American University of Cairo.

641
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,865
Master's degree in civil engineering.

642
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:48,036
Worked for Bechtel
in Kuwait and in Dubai.

643
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,249
Moved to Beirut in 1982.

644
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:53,291
Met his Lebanese wife there.

645
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:54,629
A Christian.

646
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,293
I'm not surprised.

647
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,503
Sir, this is the motion
filed by the defense.

648
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,901
Traumatic pneumothorax occurs

649
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,783
when the pleural cavity
surrounding the lungs is punctured.

650
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,198
It was literally skewered

651
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,412
by the fractured rib,

652
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,248
resulting in acute pain,

653
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,663
labored breathing,
and a raised heart rate.

654
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,206
Dr. Badran,

655
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,417
is it serious?

656
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:40,092
The pressure on a lung
can damage it

657
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,127
and displace other organs.

658
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:45,597
Can you describe
what Mrs. Hanna went through?

659
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,682
She was hospitalized

660
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:50,602
for a preterm delivery
by caesarian section.

661
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:54,849
If she hadn't arrive in time,
she might have lost the baby.

662
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,691
What caused this?

663
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,026
It was the...

664
00:44:58,571 --> 00:44:59,982
It was the direct result

665
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,449
of the emotional shock
from seeing her husband unconscious.

666
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,987
Can an emotional shock
lead to a miscarriage?

667
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,078
Sure.

668
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:12,075
Plus she had contractions

669
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:15,123
when she pulled her husband to her car.

670
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:17,712
Thank you, Doctor.

671
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,798
Dr. Khawam,

672
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:30,847
had Mr. Tony followed
his doctor's advice,

673
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,561
could the traumatic pneumothorax
have occurred?

674
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:34,975
Unlikely.

675
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,849
So he brought it upon himself.

676
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,316
Objection, Your Honor.

677
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,355
Mr. Tony,

678
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:42,400
did you follow your doctor's advice
to get rest?

679
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,028
I had to go to work.
I have bills to pay.

680
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,821
We're not contesting this.

681
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,447
Can you describe
the movements you made?

682
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:56,623
I lifted a heavy battery.
It hurt, then I fell.

683
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,835
Can those movements provoke
a traumatic pneumothorax?

684
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:01,923
No doubt.

685
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,635
Remember: the defendant's blow
caused the fracture.

686
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,845
But not the ensuing complications.

687
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,465
No fracture, no complications!

688
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:12,012
He'd have had none
had he obeyed his doctor.

689
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,386
Objection.

690
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,308
Please let her finish.

691
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:18,607
Mr. Tony claims the premature delivery

692
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,442
was due to the shock
of seeing her husband,

693
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:26,031
and the contractions were due
to pulling her husband to the car.

694
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,569
These are the hospital's records.

695
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,540
They belong to Mrs. Hanna.
They date back to 2013 and 2014.

696
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,542
Please look at them.

697
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:40,871
As you can see,

698
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:44,671
Mrs. Hanna had two miscarriages,
on the 3rd and the 5th months.

699
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:46,672
Dr. Khawam,

700
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,388
can a woman
with a history of miscarriages

701
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,600
be prone to a premature birth
with no outside factors?

702
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,014
Yes.

703
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,889
No further questions.

704
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,192
- Did you have to?
- It's scientific evidence.

705
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:11,569
That's not right.

706
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,912
You're accused of a crime
you didn't commit.

707
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,997
We're prying into private lives.

708
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,867
We're exposing them in public.
It's not right!

709
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:22,371
What is right?
They do it to us, we do it to them.

710
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,247
I don't want this!

711
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,093
As an engineer,
he was very eXperienced.

712
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,639
But since he's Palestinian,
he's not allowed to practice here.

713
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:37,636
So I hired him as a foreman.

714
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,308
In charge of how many workers?

715
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:43,024
60 to 75.

716
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,773
How would you describe
Mr. Yasser's work?

717
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:47,563
He was thorough.

718
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,815
He always finished on time.

719
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:54,070
We called him the rooster,
because he always showed up early

720
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,492
and went home
after the last prayer call.

721
00:47:57,249 --> 00:48:00,162
So the company was happy
with his work.

722
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,455
Yes.

723
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,796
How long was he supposed
to work for you?

724
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,211
- 18 months.
- How long did he last?

725
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,299
6 weeks.

726
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,918
6 weeks?

727
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,127
What happened?

728
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:11,970
One day,

729
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:15,933
he cut some cables
that were left on the street.

730
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:20,808
Another time, I showed up,
and found a crane, a Liebherr.

731
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,772
He ordered it without asking.

732
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,766
It cost us $800 per day,

733
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,440
because he didn't want
to use the other crane.

734
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,279
One day, he exploded like a time bomb.

735
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:33,822
He grabbed a sledgehammer
and tore down the façade.

736
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:36,619
What's new?

737
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,910
A guy from the Christian Party
is suing a Palestinian.

738
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:43,961
<i>He was not only embarrassing
but also dangerous.</i>

739
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,672
So finally I said that was it,
and I fired him.

740
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,632
Did he show any remorse?

741
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,133
Ask him.

742
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,969
So basically,

743
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,680
you hire Mr. Yasser,

744
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,266
you help him out,
and then he betrays you.

745
00:48:58,519 --> 00:48:59,475
Yes.

746
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,311
I was very hurt.

747
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:02,978
He was ungrateful.

748
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:04,723
Ungrateful?

749
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,941
I took a risk when I hired him.

750
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:10,187
You know, when you hire a Palestinian,

751
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:14,067
you get accused of trying to settle
half a million Palestinians here,

752
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,318
and you know what that means.

753
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,536
No, can you explain?

754
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,371
You give Palestinians jobs here,

755
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,287
they won't return to Palestine.

756
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:27,208
The Israelis are happy,
which makes you a traitor.

757
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,539
Thank you.

758
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:31,341
No further questions.

759
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,506
Counselor Nadine, your turn.

760
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:41,852
Mr. Salah, you mentioned a pillar
that shifted,

761
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:45,518
which turned Mr. Yasser
into a "time bomb".

762
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,729
What would have happened
if he hadn't spotted it?

763
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,227
It could have collapsed,

764
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,104
causing injuries.

765
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:53,355
Possibly.

766
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:58,243
You also said that he rented
this thing that cost $800.

767
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,408
- What's it called again?
- Liebherr.

768
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,414
What's a Liebherr?

769
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,035
- A big German crane.
- Is it a good crane?

770
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:08,503
It's German.

771
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,834
Why didn't he use the other crane?

772
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:11,831
It's Chinese.

773
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,800
He claims
everything made in China is crap.

774
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:18,592
You had about 75 foreign workers.

775
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,839
Yes.

776
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,592
Normally, foreign workers get
no social security,

777
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,971
no health insurance,
no work benefits, etc.

778
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,226
No company gives that.

779
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,601
How come your workers got all that?

780
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:31,981
He came up with a plan

781
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:35,527
where the workers
would recycle scrap metal,

782
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,321
then sell it back to the company.

783
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,785
In exchange,
they got insurance coverage.

784
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,825
In the end, your company...

785
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:47,326
So because of his love
of perfection and compassion,

786
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:48,827
aggression is justified?

787
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:51,626
Mr. Yasser is not aggressive by nature.

788
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:52,668
Nature?

789
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:55,212
Are we debating nature here?

790
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,961
So why are we debating
in a courthouse?

791
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:01,306
We should be lying down on a couch
in front of a therapist.

792
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,175
It pays better.

793
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,228
What's neXt?
I shoot you with a gun,

794
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,440
I open your chest,
I smash your brain on the sidewalk,

795
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:12,605
I stab Marcelino Zamata siX times,

796
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,396
but my nature is good.

797
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:23,369
Order in the court!

798
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:27,832
Your Honor,
when Mr. Yasser is given a task,

799
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,954
he does it seriously and responsibly,
from start to finish,

800
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,127
just like when he fixed
Mr. Tony's gutter...

801
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:38,422
Mr. Tony Hanna is a law-abiding citizen,

802
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,045
but deserves to get beaten up

803
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,923
because Mr. Yasser is serious
and responsible!

804
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,470
Counselor, let your daughter finish!

805
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,982
Why didn't you say she's your daughter?

806
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:53,975
<i>It makes no difference.</i>

807
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,443
Of course it does.

808
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:59,280
She knows your methods, your tricks.
She learned from you.

809
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,444
Tricks?

810
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:03,068
You think law is a trick?

811
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,241
<i>Father against daughter.
A bit strange!</i>

812
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,705
Mr. Tony, your cellphone.

813
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,416
It's called conflict of interest.
I don't buy it.

814
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,251
<i>I do.</i>

815
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,081
Get off the case.

816
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:20,422
Everything's a battlefield for you.
Not for me. I didn't grow up in the war.

817
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,092
My life is not like yours.
I'm not you.

818
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,591
Your mother would have been heartbroken.

819
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,432
I won't drop the case.
See you in court.

820
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,521
You're just a corporate lawyer.

821
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:36,894
I'd hate to see you
lose your first case to me.

822
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,688
Who said you'll win?

823
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:50,331
<i>For the sake of your children,</i>

824
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,292
<i>so they don't end up
living like the Palestinian refugee,</i>

825
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:56,879
<i>and behaving
like the Palestinian refugee,</i>

826
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:01,881
<i>wandering the world,
ruining everything in his path,</i>

827
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:06,507
<i>drinking from our wells
then spitting in them...</i>

828
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:11,390
That morning, Mr. Yasser
went to Mr. Tony to apologize.

829
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:14,560
Once he heard that speech,
he changed his mind.

830
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,103
I find it patriotic.

831
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,397
For a Palestinian, it's offensive.

832
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:19,360
Offensive?

833
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:22,356
We often hear: "the road to Palestine
runs through Beirut".

834
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,198
My client didn't say this phrase.

835
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,658
Neither did my client!

836
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,527
We hear speeches all the time.

837
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,154
Incendiary speeches,

838
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:31,998
subversive speeches,

839
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:33,583
sexist speeches,

840
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:36,419
I hear speeches
looking at myself in the mirror.

841
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:39,881
- I can attest to that.
- Let's stay in court, counselors.

842
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,841
I'd like to say...

843
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:43,380
Your Honor,

844
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,712
we live in the Middle East.

845
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,636
The word "offensive" was born here.

846
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,226
It's not up to Mr. Tony
to consider people's sensibilities.

847
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,729
That's their problem, not his.

848
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:57,895
Can you please allow
the defense to finish?

849
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:04,197
I wish to reveal the words
that pushed Mr. Yasser to hit Mr. Tony.

850
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,823
Go ahead.

851
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,193
The words are:

852
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,249
"I wish Ariel Sharon
had wiped you all out."

853
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,993
Yes! He should have!

854
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:18,707
Take that back!

855
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,717
That's disgraceful!

856
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,757
Order in the court!

857
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,676
Mr. Tony,

858
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:36,684
did you know these words violated

859
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,024
Mr. Yasser's dignity and identity,
and are a hate crime?

860
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,735
Hate crime?
For a humiliation?

861
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,604
Which humiliation is this?

862
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:47,983
The one in 1948? 1956?
The Six-Day War?

863
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,109
The Yom Kippur War?
The 1982 War?

864
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,157
They're all humiliations.

865
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:54,868
My client can't be blamed
for those mishaps.

866
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,458
The Palestinian tragedy
is not a mishap.

867
00:54:57,753 --> 00:55:00,291
It was not a mishap,
it was a catastrophe!

868
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,297
Approach the bench.

869
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:14,259
Get a hold of yourself!

870
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,136
Think.

871
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,388
You're right, I got carried away.

872
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:21,483
I know you, Wajdy.
I won't wear a bulletproof vest.

873
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:22,896
I'm warning you.

874
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,379
<i>Today at the courthouse,</i>

875
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:52,301
<i>members of the Christian Party
clashed with Palestinian refugees.</i>

876
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:53,969
Which TV?

877
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:57,936
<i>New TV. We'd like to have you
on our show.</i>

878
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,850
<i>We can send a driver.</i>

879
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,268
I'm at the hospital.

880
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,812
<i>We can come to you.</i>

881
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,605
Let me think about it.

882
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,569
Great.

883
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,440
Your lawyer is pretentious.
It's ridiculous.

884
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:13,159
He's putting up a good fight.

885
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:16,075
You don't like it
because you live in denial.

886
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,697
You're just his puppet.

887
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:20,291
He lets nothing slide
without contesting it.

888
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:21,455
Really?

889
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:24,921
Why did he say
the Palestinians were a catastrophe?

890
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,038
He got carried away.

891
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,006
I don't get it.

892
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:31,048
A famous lawyer,
who defended the party's leader,

893
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,797
decides to take on a trifling case?
For free?

894
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:37,471
For you, it's a trifle.
For me, it's everything.

895
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,435
- How so?
- It's about the truth.

896
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:40,804
Which truth?

897
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,478
You provoked and insulted this man.
You hurt yourself working.

898
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,358
Really?

899
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:49,946
I was publicly humiliated
because of both of you!

900
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,609
Quiet!
You're upsetting her.

901
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:54,075
She can't hear us, she's just moving.

902
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,489
Really?

903
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:58,580
In your womb, she heard everything
but now nothing?

904
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,330
Mr. Tony?

905
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:06,170
I work for a security firm.

906
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,915
If you need protection, we're ready.

907
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:23,976
<i>Courthouse Invasion - Webb wants
Palestinians Thrown into the Sea</i>

908
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:35,609
Don't answer any questions
or any provocations.

909
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,531
Walk straight inside.

910
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,130
Is this a smear campaign?

911
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,841
No, it's a tribute
to Wajdy Webb's career.

912
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:55,758
- Your daughter is your opponent.
- Wajdy Webb encourages dissent.

913
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,677
Why do you always speak
in the third person?

914
00:57:58,934 --> 00:57:59,799
It sounds better.

915
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,428
Why are you suing a Palestinian
while Gaza is being bombed?

916
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,396
Why are you here and not in Gaza?

917
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:09,393
Are you doing this because you lost
the party leader's case?

918
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,730
Thank you for coming to Beirut,
Mr. Ghandour.

919
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:16,574
I know it's hard for you to travel.

920
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:19,035
- You came from Amman?
- Yes.

921
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,449
- That's where you live?
- Yes.

922
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:25,166
This man was full of vigor and health.

923
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:27,786
Until the day everything changed.

924
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:32,378
He's been confined to a wheelchair
for 45 years.

925
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:35,631
It happened in Jordan,

926
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,220
July 1971.

927
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,635
After months of heavy fighting,

928
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:45,353
the Jordanian army dismantles the PLO
in the Palestinian camps.

929
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,560
What was your role in that operation?

930
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:49,898
I was the cook.

931
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:51,359
Did you see any combat?

932
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,445
No, I just fed the troops.

933
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:57,570
Can you tell us what happened?

934
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:01,073
At the end of the Civil War,

935
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,864
after the PLO was expelled,

936
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:08,289
the Palestinian refugees were in misery.

937
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,879
We set up tents to serve them meals.

938
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:13,418
Every day.

939
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:15,671
One day,

940
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:17,798
the line was very long,

941
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,091
endless.

942
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,970
The mood was very tense.

943
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,761
A woman came forward
for her meal.

944
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:30,015
While I was serving food,

945
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,562
one of her children

946
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,310
stole a piece of bread.

947
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,979
I asked him to give it back,

948
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,981
he refused.

949
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,201
I tried to take it by force,

950
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:43,865
he started screaming.

951
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,074
Next thing I remember,

952
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:49,792
a young man

953
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:52,913
lunged at me
and started hitting me.

954
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:55,464
I tried to defend myself,

955
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:59,836
but he was full of rage.

956
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:03,841
He hit me savagely.

957
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:07,097
He even struck me with a metal pot.

958
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:08,845
I lost consciousness.

959
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:11,223
When I woke up,

960
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,770
I couldn't move.

961
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:17,020
A cerebral hematoma
due to cranial trauma.

962
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,654
What happened to that man?

963
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:22,116
He must have crossed the border.

964
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,326
When the PLO guerillas fled,

965
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,196
the Jordanian army looked the other way.

966
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:31,167
We wanted nothing more
than to see them go.

967
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,123
Do you recognize this man?

968
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,016
Mr. Mohamed,

969
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:50,811
can you tell us who this person is?

970
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:05,193
A life crushed
by the brutality of the accused.

971
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:08,571
What Yasser Salameh
inflicted on this man

972
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:10,824
shows his deeper nature,

973
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,122
and proves
that he has a history of violence.

974
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:17,713
Violence is his sole means
of functioning in society.

975
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:19,377
That's unacceptable.

976
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,250
This man is dangerous!

977
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:25,342
And if he walks free today,
it's because history was on his side.

978
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,888
The political context prevented him
from being brought to justice.

979
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,888
And now we're being asked
to absolve him again,

980
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:35,147
for the same political context:

981
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,643
the holy Palestinian cause!

982
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,861
Lock him up!

983
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:42,612
Silence!

984
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,616
Stick to the case, counselor.

985
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:50,988
True, he didn't paralyze Tony Hanna,
but he came close.

986
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:55,038
And at this very moment,
a newborn's life hangs in the balance.

987
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,579
No further questions.

988
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:03,425
Yours, Counsel.

989
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,760
Mr. Mohamed,

990
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:13,227
what you call the Jordanian Civil War
is known as Black September, right?

991
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:16,188
It was a civil war.
Many Palestinians live in Jordan.

992
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:18,353
History remembers it
as Black September.

993
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:21,444
The Jordanian army
hit Palestinian refugees,

994
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,188
killing more than 3,000,
mainly civilians,

995
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:27,442
and based on recognized criteria,
this is a massacre.

996
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,614
The militias were hiding
among civilians.

997
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,578
We had no choice.

998
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:36,166
Then, your army decided
to eradicate the PLO at any price.

999
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,786
They tried to assassinate King Hussein.

1000
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:43,132
They were a state within a state,
they launched cross-border attacks.

1001
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:44,751
They endangered the whole country.

1002
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,549
When you kicked them out,
they came here.

1003
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:51,056
Order, or I'll throw you out!

1004
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:54,639
Mr. Mohamed,
you say you were a cook.

1005
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:55,682
Yes.

1006
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,271
But you were in the army.

1007
01:02:57,649 --> 01:02:58,639
Yes.

1008
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,016
Did you wear a uniform?

1009
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:02,776
Yes.

1010
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:06,739
Yasser Salameh had no reason
to believe you weren't a soldier.

1011
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:08,654
I was serving them food.

1012
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,368
The Jordanian Army
attacks a refugee camp,

1013
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:14,204
indiscriminately kills
civilians and militants,

1014
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,915
then decides to feed
those who survived.

1015
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:20,457
The oppressor humiliates the oppressed
with his generosity.

1016
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:25,379
In this conteXt, Salameh saw a soldier
take a piece of bread from a child,

1017
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,592
his blood boils,
he attacks the soldier.

1018
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:31,677
My client isn't the bloodthirsty man
you describe. No!

1019
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:35,517
Yasser Salameh can't just stand there
while injustice happens.

1020
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:39,354
The proof is he refused
to repeat Tony Hanna's words,

1021
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,066
though it would have been
in his interest.

1022
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:45,440
He didn't do it
because those words are humiliating.

1023
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:50,491
Tony Hanna's words made my client
act in extreme distress

1024
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,201
and pushed him to lash out.

1025
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,327
Penal code, Article 228:

1026
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:58,325
even if a perpetrator exceeds
the bounds of self-defense,

1027
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:01,999
he may be acquitted
if he acted in extreme distress

1028
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,998
that hampered
his judgment and self-control.

1029
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,093
Fucking prick.

1030
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,773
The workers agreed to work overtime.

1031
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:25,776
You can inform the deputy.

1032
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:29,814
It's for you.

1033
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:33,776
What is it?

1034
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:35,244
Open it.

1035
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,207
Why?

1036
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:43,953
The deputy called me.

1037
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:48,082
He doesn't want to risk it.

1038
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,376
I tried to convince him.

1039
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:52,795
He doesn't want you here.

1040
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:27,213
- Mr. Yasser, are you a politician?
- No.

1041
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,876
- A member of a party?
- No.

1042
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,216
- Any organization?
- No.

1043
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:35,588
Have you been solicited or asked
to speak on anyone's behalf?

1044
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:36,555
No.

1045
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:38,720
Has the PLO,

1046
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:40,718
or Hamas, or any party

1047
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:43,392
asked you to represent them
now or in the past?

1048
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:44,434
No.

1049
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,933
- So you don't represent anyone.
- No.

1050
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:51,195
Where were you
when you hit Tony Hanna?

1051
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,147
In front of his garage.

1052
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,449
- Who was present?
- My boss.

1053
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:56,533
Who else?

1054
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:57,826
No one.

1055
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:01,072
Any bystanders?

1056
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:02,824
I don't recall.

1057
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:05,789
Did he have a bullhorn?

1058
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:11,257
Did Tony Hanna use a bullhorn to say,

1059
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,501
"I wish Ariel Sharon
had wiped you all out"?

1060
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:16,045
No.

1061
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,972
Did he spray graffiti, call the press?

1062
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:19,965
No.

1063
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:23,056
So when he said those words,
it was in private.

1064
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:23,894
Yes.

1065
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,934
Therefore, no publishing.

1066
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:28,934
No libel, no crime.

1067
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,690
All my client did
was express a "wish".

1068
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,279
He said, "I wish".

1069
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:36,274
Is a wish a crime?

1070
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:40,115
What's neXt?
My thoughts? My dreams?

1071
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,790
If I dreamed I killed you, am I guilty?

1072
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:46,333
Where do we stop?

1073
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:49,829
We are not judging thoughts and dreams,
but words.

1074
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,671
All he said was,

1075
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:53,757
"I wish Sharon
had wiped you all out."

1076
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:58,254
Are his words going to push Ariel Sharon
to wipe the Palestinians out?

1077
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,008
Sharon doesn't need
Tony Hanna's permission.

1078
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,385
The words of my client

1079
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:07,889
were spoken in anger in a dispute.

1080
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,941
Were they harsh? Yes.
But that's it.

1081
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:12,685
He was exercising his right

1082
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,232
of freedom of speech.

1083
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:17,986
Mr. Yasser,

1084
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:21,198
if his words offended you,

1085
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,365
go to court!

1086
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:24,284
That's where justice is served.

1087
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:27,124
When denied rights,
people lose faith in justice.

1088
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,039
Why is Tony Hanna responsible?

1089
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,958
Blame those who are responsible.

1090
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:34,631
Who's the aggressor here?

1091
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:37,254
You, Mr. Yasser.

1092
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:39,925
The moment you laid your hands
on my client,

1093
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,298
you committed a crime,
you went too far.

1094
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:48,141
The defense points
to the Palestinians' despair,

1095
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:51,015
as if they were the world's
only oppressed people.

1096
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:52,062
And the Armenians?

1097
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:55,652
The Kurds, the gays, the gypsies,
artists, street vendors?

1098
01:07:55,905 --> 01:08:00,024
Who isn't deprived of rights?
I don't see them beat each other up.

1099
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:03,323
Mr. Yasser,

1100
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:07,497
just because you're a refugee,

1101
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,867
a victim with no country,

1102
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:12,415
that gives you no excuse to be violent.

1103
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:15,460
Even if you are
the most oppressed person,

1104
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:19,836
it doesn't make you the spokesman
of morality and justice!

1105
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:27,176
And why all the fuss?

1106
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,929
Because Palestinians get wiped out?

1107
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:32,272
Because Mr. Tony said these words?

1108
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,641
No.

1109
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:35,733
The reason is Sharon.

1110
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,066
If Tony Hanna had said,

1111
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,106
I wish the Eskimos,

1112
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,527
or the Smurfs,

1113
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:42,865
had wiped you all out,

1114
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,111
we wouldn't be here debating!

1115
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:47,283
Eskimos and Smurfs are not the point.

1116
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,827
The counselor is sidetracking us.

1117
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:54,036
Silence!

1118
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:59,383
When a Jew does it, it's a crime,
but when an Arab kills an Arab, it's OK.

1119
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:03,462
As long as we keep it
in the family, right?

1120
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,510
- The Jews did worse!
- So say you!

1121
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:08,384
You right-wing scum!
Don't talk about Palestinians!

1122
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:09,726
You're a traitor!

1123
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:13,014
Oh, sure!
Only Christians committed atrocities!

1124
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:15,391
You collaborated with the Jews.

1125
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:19,232
With the devil too!
No apologies! We were the resistance.

1126
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:22,273
Don't mention the resistance,
you dirty dog!

1127
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,032
Counselor, please!

1128
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:33,458
Dad, be careful.

1129
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,748
None of your business!
Go defend him.

1130
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,757
The first resistance was us.

1131
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,126
Way before you.

1132
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,003
Zionist dog!

1133
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:12,331
This lawyer is filthy,
a Zionist, his client is a Zionist...

1134
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,371
The prick deserves to be shot.

1135
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:20,206
Let those assholes know
if they come here,

1136
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,377
this isn't Mossul,

1137
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:22,875
this is Fassouh!

1138
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,515
Do we know who was filming inside?

1139
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:33,181
We don't know how cameras entered
the courtroom.

1140
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:36,146
We'll tighten security.

1141
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,105
Why bring the Jews into this?

1142
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,444
These were your words, not mine.

1143
01:10:42,697 --> 01:10:44,814
I'm being called
an Israeli sympathizer.

1144
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,906
You started the whole thing.

1145
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,402
- You should defend me.
<i>- What did you expect?</i>

1146
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,991
A walk in the park?

1147
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,830
<i>This is war.
Waged in court.</i>

1148
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,042
I asked you, are you up to the task?
You said yes.

1149
01:10:58,045 --> 01:10:59,957
I didn't want it to be political.

1150
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:01,204
You came to me, no?

1151
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:04,333
When I asked what you wanted,
what did you say?

1152
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:05,755
"When we're done with him,

1153
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:09,255
"I want him to say
I'm 100 times worse than Sharon."

1154
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,974
If you can't handle it,
I'll drop the case.

1155
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:27,440
Son of a bitch!

1156
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,783
- Are you OK?
- Yes, you?

1157
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:30,696
Fine.

1158
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,919
<i>We know where you live.</i>

1159
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:49,260
Who is this?

1160
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:53,973
Who is it?

1161
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:59,809
You don't scare me.
Don't call here.

1162
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:02,228
Do you hear me?

1163
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,810
Asshole!

1164
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,565
<i>Fassouh Police.</i>

1165
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,986
I'm being threatened.
Could you trace this number?

1166
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:16,576
<i>We can't do that.</i>

1167
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,119
You're the police.

1168
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:20,368
<i>Try the Attorney General's office.</i>

1169
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:22,460
They're threatening my family.

1170
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:24,705
<i>Come to the station
and fill out a report.</i>

1171
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:33,426
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1172
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:44,099
Turn the light off.

1173
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,147
Stay here. Don't leave.

1174
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:52,570
Who?

1175
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:55,077
Boss, it's me Eli.

1176
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,532
- What's wrong?
- The garage.

1177
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,077
It just happened.

1178
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:21,515
We heard two bikes.

1179
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:24,098
Look.

1180
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,313
They're provoking us.

1181
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:30,529
The police don't care.

1182
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,277
That's him!

1183
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:05,104
Mr. Deputy! Sir?

1184
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:12,987
This poor man

1185
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,278
delivers pizza to feed his family.

1186
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,447
Some hotshot lawyer

1187
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:20,866
thinks anyone who rides a moped

1188
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:24,666
is pro-Palestinian,
and so deserves to be run over.

1189
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:29,246
Are you accusing Tony Hanna
of being pro-Israel?

1190
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:31,749
He serves their interests.
Same thing.

1191
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,543
I call on anyone

1192
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,670
who supports the Palestinian cause

1193
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,672
to stand with Yasser Salameh.

1194
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:10,454
I'm told you're both decent people,

1195
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:13,549
love your families, work hard.

1196
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:17,924
I work hard too:
squabbling deputies, water shortages,

1197
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,046
power outages, trash collection,

1198
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:24,176
two million refugees,
terrorists sneaking in.

1199
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:27,646
Where is this country headed?

1200
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,691
I've asked you to come here
to put an end to all this.

1201
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,440
That's why we're in court,
Mr. President.

1202
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:35,483
How about

1203
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:38,027
we resolve this out of court?

1204
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:41,239
You know,
lawyers like to drag things out,

1205
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:42,368
to show off.

1206
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:44,157
They have huge egos.

1207
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:46,577
They don't care about you.

1208
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:47,915
They're working hard.

1209
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:50,286
But they're not helping you reconcile.

1210
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:54,168
You must set aside your differences,
for your country's sake.

1211
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,041
Which one, Mr. President?

1212
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:57,884
They hate this country.

1213
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,504
We live in the same country.
We're brothers.

1214
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,638
No, we're not.

1215
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:06,260
I want you to turn the page,
here and now,

1216
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,261
and everyone goes home happy.

1217
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,271
You can ask, but we can't.

1218
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:11,560
Sure you can.

1219
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,524
It wouldn't be sincere.

1220
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:17,112
Between sincerity and stability,

1221
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:19,151
I'd choose stability.

1222
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:22,318
I could end the trial.

1223
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:23,659
You can't do that.

1224
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:25,203
I'm the President.

1225
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:27,075
You're a state employee, sir.

1226
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:31,292
We pay taxes
for you to protect our rights,

1227
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,081
even our right to go to court.

1228
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:35,083
What he's trying to tell you...

1229
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:36,331
I don't care!

1230
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,174
I went to his boss,

1231
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:39,634
to the police,

1232
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:41,048
then to court,

1233
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:44,548
all I wanted was an apology,
but no one would hear me out.

1234
01:16:44,809 --> 01:16:47,222
I feel you're siding with them too.

1235
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,141
Why?
Why does everyone take their side?

1236
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:51,980
I'm not taking sides.

1237
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:53,565
Are they better than us?

1238
01:16:53,818 --> 01:16:55,559
I want to salvage the ship.

1239
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,812
We get punished, and they get impunity.

1240
01:16:58,072 --> 01:17:00,689
Why?
Are they God's chosen people?

1241
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:03,024
Do you want to start a war?

1242
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,352
Get in.

1243
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:40,671
Go ahead.

1244
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:36,428
Mr. Geagea, let's get to the point.

1245
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:38,396
Tony Hanna said:

1246
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:41,983
"I wish Ariel Sharon
had wiped you all out."

1247
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:43,477
What do you think?

1248
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:46,696
We're not the Third Reich
telling our members,

1249
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,611
what they can or can't say.

1250
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:53,487
Do Mr. Hanna's words reflect
your party's position?

1251
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:55,454
Yes or no?

1252
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:58,283
We've settled up with the Palestinians.

1253
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,327
But look at the riots!

1254
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:02,499
The war ended in 1990,

1255
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:05,464
but in people's heads,
it's still there.

1256
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:06,424
Why?

1257
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:08,885
We never had a national reconciliation.

1258
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,220
Where's this reconciliation,

1259
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,305
how can it happen,

1260
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:15,892
when the warlords and religious figures

1261
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:17,727
are still in power,

1262
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:20,229
including yourself?

1263
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:25,352
I offered a public apology
for mistakes we committed in the war.

1264
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:28,946
Many still think your party

1265
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,282
was the most violent one,

1266
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:33,868
and committed the most abuses
during the war.

1267
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:35,407
Mr. Walid,

1268
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:37,872
when you lose the war,

1269
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:40,412
you become history's scapegoat.

1270
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:44,704
I'd like to say something
to Tony Hanna:

1271
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,374
I know you're watching.

1272
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:50,460
<i>Don't think I don't understand</i>

1273
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:51,882
your pain.

1274
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:54,343
I know what happened to you.

1275
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:56,299
We can't change the past.

1276
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:58,221
We can remember it,

1277
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:01,642
but we can't live in it
and let it control us.

1278
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:03,021
And then?

1279
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:05,184
The war is over.

1280
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:11,815
If Bashir Gemayel were still alive,
he would tell us the same thing,

1281
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:13,988
it's time to turn the page.

1282
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:16,410
<i>Did your party</i>

1283
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:21,082
<i>ask Wajdy Webb
to defend Tony Hanna?</i>

1284
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:22,166
<i>Not at all.</i>

1285
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:24,877
<i>But he defended you in the past</i>?

1286
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,871
<i>It doesn't mean he works for us.</i>

1287
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,343
Tony Hanna is registered
in Beirut,

1288
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:34,428
District 135.

1289
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:38,220
But the records show
he was born in District 112.

1290
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:41,477
The change of registry was in 1976.

1291
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,187
He was 6 years old.

1292
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:48,276
Birthplace: Damour.

1293
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:52,651
Why didn't he mention it?

1294
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,240
We didn't ask.

1295
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:56,655
Or he didn't want to.

1296
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,197
Tony Hanna didn't want to tell us.

1297
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,542
Take a look at these.

1298
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,374
Mr. Tony, have you ever belonged
to a militia?

1299
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:46,208
No.

1300
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:49,626
Ever used a weapon?
Even a hunting rifle?

1301
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:50,793
I never shot anyone.

1302
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:55,043
Have you ever attended
a political rally?

1303
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,504
Every rally of our party's leader.

1304
01:22:58,849 --> 01:23:00,306
Did you ever fight in the war?

1305
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:01,299
No.

1306
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:02,596
I wish I had.

1307
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:04,343
I was too young.

1308
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:06,847
- What if war starts?
- We are at war.

1309
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:08,643
I mean a real war.

1310
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:15,063
I don't know. Maybe.

1311
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:18,866
Do you have something
against Palestinians?

1312
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,868
"I wish Ariel Sharon
had wiped you all out."

1313
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,616
Very insulting.

1314
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,623
Curse his mother, his sister, his honor,

1315
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:33,752
our vocabulary is rich with insults.

1316
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,171
Why choose those words?

1317
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:38,135
I'm impressed.

1318
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:41,096
You're good with words.

1319
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,262
You should join my law firm.

1320
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:48,354
As the defense said,
you went too far.

1321
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,057
From their first contact,

1322
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:53,355
Tony Hanna knew
that Yasser Salameh was Palestinian.

1323
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:55,820
- You knew it from the start?
- Yes.

1324
01:23:56,073 --> 01:23:57,985
How?

1325
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,743
- From his accent.
- From his accent.

1326
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:03,945
Any person in his right mind,

1327
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:07,324
wouldn't say what you said
to your opponent.

1328
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:10,793
And if he assaulted you, it's because,

1329
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,708
and I quote the defense:

1330
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:18,043
your words put him
"in extreme distress".

1331
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:22,714
Mr. Tony,

1332
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,349
where do you come from?

1333
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:30,563
Please tell us
which village you come from?

1334
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:32,723
Damour.

1335
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:34,396
- Were you born there?
- Yes.

1336
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:35,814
And your parents?

1337
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,237
- Yes.
- What did your father do?

1338
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,190
He grew bananas.

1339
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:45,240
Damour is famous for its bananas.
Still considered the best.

1340
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:48,661
How would you describe
your life back then?

1341
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,075
- Normal.
- Like how?

1342
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:51,951
Normal.

1343
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:57,048
Like in every village?
Simple, calm, peaceful?

1344
01:24:57,301 --> 01:24:57,882
Yes.

1345
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:00,422
A mainly Christian population?

1346
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:01,715
Yes.

1347
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:05,639
When was the last time you went?

1348
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,559
- A while ago.
- How long?

1349
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:10,178
A while ago.

1350
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:12,977
- Ten, twenty, thirty years?
- Roughly.

1351
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:16,063
Damour is only a 20-minute drive.

1352
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,606
Stop asking.

1353
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:18,979
I don't need to go.

1354
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:20,821
Don't need to, don't want to,

1355
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:22,315
or can't?

1356
01:25:28,582 --> 01:25:30,323
How old are you now?

1357
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,199
46.

1358
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:35,499
In 1976, you were 6 years old.

1359
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:36,833
Yes.

1360
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:46,469
Do you remember
the night of January 21, 1976?

1361
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:51,602
Mr. Tony?

1362
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:53,437
May we talk in private?

1363
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:54,396
Not now.

1364
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:57,393
- You don't have the right to...
- Not now!

1365
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:00,648
Your Honors,

1366
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:04,900
I have some footage
that I'd like to show, if I may.

1367
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,276
What sort of footage?

1368
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:11,369
Footage shot in Damour
between January 9 and 21, 1976.

1369
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:13,954
That's irrelevant to this trial.

1370
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:18,922
The defense claims
Tony's words were driven by hate.

1371
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:22,087
I want to prove that it's true.

1372
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:25,010
The film will stir up emotions.
It's irrelevant.

1373
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:27,596
You made us listen to Bashir Gemayel,

1374
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:29,465
it also stirred emotions.

1375
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:32,434
Can you describe them to us?

1376
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:37,557
To better understand,
it must be seen.

1377
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,373
They used to call it
"The Bride of the Sea".

1378
01:26:57,879 --> 01:26:59,461
It was a beautiful village.

1379
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,047
Pristine beaches,

1380
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:03,423
vast banana fields.

1381
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:07,129
Life in this village was calm,

1382
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:08,755
simple,

1383
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:10,556
peaceful.

1384
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:16,429
All that changed on January 9, 1976.

1385
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:20,270
Trucks loaded with fighters,

1386
01:27:20,527 --> 01:27:24,362
with artillery and rocket launchers
rolled into Damour.

1387
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:28,321
They numbered
around 4,000 to 5,000 fighters.

1388
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:32,412
Young men from the village,
in various Christian militias,

1389
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:34,364
fought to protect the city.

1390
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,491
Most inhabitants,

1391
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:38,368
around 15,000,

1392
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:41,420
hid in the village of Sadiyat.

1393
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:43,957
The Lebanese army

1394
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:47,551
could only send a few helicopters
to evacuate them.

1395
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,760
Families got separated.

1396
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:56,686
Some stayed in Sadiyat,
others were evacuated to the north.

1397
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:06,028
Those who couldn't reach Sadiyat
took to the sea,

1398
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,192
or fled along the train tracks.

1399
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:15,830
Those who couldn't escape
hid in churches,

1400
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:18,036
like Saint Eli Church.

1401
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:23,458
Militiamen surrounded the village

1402
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:25,586
and launched the final assault.

1403
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,088
On January 21,

1404
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:30,632
after 12 days of fighting,

1405
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:32,763
Damour fell.

1406
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:36,975
They entered the village,

1407
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:38,811
arrested many young men,

1408
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:41,101
gathered them in the village square,

1409
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:43,395
lined them up,

1410
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:44,892
and executed them.

1411
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:49,318
They combed every street, every house.

1412
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,531
The first victims
were Samy Rizk's family.

1413
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,404
The whole family was killed.

1414
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:57,614
The orders were to spare no one.

1415
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,207
Entire families were killed.

1416
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:03,203
The Abu Merhis, the Metnis,

1417
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:05,204
the Eids, the Abdallahs,

1418
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:07,498
the Kanaan family.

1419
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:09,007
Children,

1420
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:10,047
mothers,

1421
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:11,259
fathers,

1422
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:12,424
grandfathers.

1423
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:17,345
There are conflicting claims

1424
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:19,935
as to which militias
carried out the massacre,

1425
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,396
but what's certain
is that it was carried out

1426
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:25,767
by the Lebanese Left Wing Movement

1427
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:29,070
and Palestinian factions,

1428
01:29:29,739 --> 01:29:31,526
such as "Sayqa",

1429
01:29:31,908 --> 01:29:33,365
and the Yarmuk army.

1430
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:40,494
The images you're seeing
are the only ones that eXist.

1431
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:45,211
Most were taken by the militiamen
as a souvenir of their heroism.

1432
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,635
More than 500 were killed,
22,000 refugees.

1433
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:55,838
It happened over a few days,

1434
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:57,180
quickly,

1435
01:29:57,434 --> 01:29:58,299
and then,

1436
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:01,602
the freeway to Damour was reopened,

1437
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:05,599
as if a truck had flipped
or a dog had been run over.

1438
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:10,777
I know what you're thinking.

1439
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:15,525
What we just saw,
we've become inured to it.

1440
01:30:15,785 --> 01:30:17,276
It doesn't affect us anymore.

1441
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:19,912
You may be right.

1442
01:30:20,624 --> 01:30:21,910
But can you say this

1443
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:25,084
to the victims?

1444
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:27,169
Or their families?

1445
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:38,381
Tony Hanna's lived about 500 meters
from the main square.

1446
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:42,059
George Hanna didn't have many options.

1447
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:44,224
Either hide them in the church, or...

1448
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:57,025
Silence.

1449
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:04,240
Counselor,

1450
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:05,662
what happened?

1451
01:31:05,919 --> 01:31:07,205
What did we expect?

1452
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:12,040
The footage put him
in "extreme distress".

1453
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:31,804
How many ribs did I break?

1454
01:33:32,482 --> 01:33:33,563
Two?

1455
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:36,020
I just patted you.

1456
01:33:37,237 --> 01:33:38,648
You know what's your problem?

1457
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:40,942
You talk too much.

1458
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:44,192
You drove everyone crazy,
lit this place on fire,

1459
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:45,988
because you talk too much.

1460
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:48,613
You just can't keep
your fucking mouth shut.

1461
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:52,078
Listen,

1462
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:58,664
your little show in court today
was pretty pathetic.

1463
01:33:59,676 --> 01:34:01,417
What did you want to prove?

1464
01:34:02,804 --> 01:34:04,170
That you're the victim?

1465
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,297
Victim my ass!

1466
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:13,645
Everyone knows
who Lebanon's Christians are.

1467
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:16,185
You talked about defending your country

1468
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:18,934
while you lived
in your fancy beach villas.

1469
01:34:19,445 --> 01:34:21,437
You played the tourists during the war.

1470
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:24,486
Shopping in Paris,
skiing in Switzerland.

1471
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:25,653
You eat sushi.

1472
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:27,151
You speak French.

1473
01:34:27,453 --> 01:34:31,663
Half the bombs that fell on you
didn't have detonators.

1474
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:34,454
You don't know what suffering is.

1475
01:34:36,212 --> 01:34:37,919
What a bunch of cry babies!

1476
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:55,683
I'm sorry.

1477
01:39:29,172 --> 01:39:30,538
Counselor.

1478
01:39:36,179 --> 01:39:38,887
Forty years ago,
a massacre took place in Damour.

1479
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:40,472
A heinous massacre.

1480
01:39:41,601 --> 01:39:44,560
Thousands of families had to flee.

1481
01:39:46,439 --> 01:39:49,853
Mr. Tony Hanna was
among the lucky survivors.

1482
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:53,522
What happened back then
remains buried.

1483
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:56,272
The perpetrators unpunished.

1484
01:39:58,075 --> 01:40:01,409
No justice. No closure. Nothing.

1485
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:10,369
We can understand why Tony Hanna
said those words to Yasser Salameh.

1486
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,706
He wanted revenge.

1487
01:40:15,551 --> 01:40:19,215
For Tony, Yasser is guilty,
guilty by association.

1488
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:23,549
We've all been through hard times.

1489
01:40:24,727 --> 01:40:27,219
We let our emotions
get the better of us,

1490
01:40:27,688 --> 01:40:30,601
like Tony Hanna
and Yasser Salameh.

1491
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:36,111
Yasser Salameh also reacted to words
that targeted his identity,

1492
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:38,529
his history, his people's history.

1493
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:42,902
When one goes too far,

1494
01:40:43,371 --> 01:40:45,283
and those words did,

1495
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:48,407
one must expect a reaction.

1496
01:40:51,629 --> 01:40:53,040
It's normal.

1497
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:55,289
It's inevitable.

1498
01:40:57,802 --> 01:40:59,634
It's human nature.

1499
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:13,398
Counselor Wajdy.

1500
01:41:19,115 --> 01:41:20,902
There was an article this morning

1501
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:24,526
about a US senator
who insulted a flight attendant.

1502
01:41:24,787 --> 01:41:28,622
She asks him to turn his cellphone off.
So he calls her a bitch.

1503
01:41:28,874 --> 01:41:31,036
The White House reacted.

1504
01:41:31,544 --> 01:41:34,207
Finally, the senator issued
a public apology.

1505
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:40,467
I wonder if this could happen
in this country.

1506
01:41:41,053 --> 01:41:42,635
If it's ever possible

1507
01:41:42,888 --> 01:41:45,596
to settle a dispute
in a respectful manner,

1508
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:47,591
and consider an apology

1509
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:50,890
is not a sign of weakness,
but a sign of decency.

1510
01:41:51,897 --> 01:41:54,890
That's all Mr. Hanna wanted.

1511
01:41:55,151 --> 01:41:56,267
An apology.

1512
01:41:56,652 --> 01:41:58,484
Plain and simple.

1513
01:41:59,905 --> 01:42:01,237
The defense maintains

1514
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:05,279
that Tony Hanna's words
targeted Mr. Salameh's identity,

1515
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:07,448
his history,
and his people's history.

1516
01:42:07,705 --> 01:42:08,991
So he hit him.

1517
01:42:09,874 --> 01:42:11,706
If Yasser Salameh is a refugee,

1518
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:13,575
so is Tony Hanna.

1519
01:42:13,836 --> 01:42:16,419
Even more,
a refugee in his own country.

1520
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:17,958
His life has been marred

1521
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:21,458
by the same suffering, tragedy,
and injustice.

1522
01:42:23,846 --> 01:42:25,007
The only difference is

1523
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:29,554
we've never showed Tony and many others
the compassion they deserve.

1524
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:32,598
On the contrary,
we've silenced them, ostracized them,

1525
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:36,940
while we know all too well
what happened to the Palestinians.

1526
01:42:38,778 --> 01:42:40,440
We talk so much about your cause,

1527
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:43,648
there's no room left
for anyone else.

1528
01:42:45,034 --> 01:42:49,950
What happened in 1976
in Damour, Jiye, Sadiyat, and Nahme,

1529
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:51,993
we're not allowed to talk about it.

1530
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:56,163
But what Tony Hanna said
to Yasser Salameh, it's allowed.

1531
01:42:56,754 --> 01:42:57,961
The truth is

1532
01:42:58,214 --> 01:43:01,878
they're the product of an old wound
that has never healed.

1533
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:06,962
What's happening in this court

1534
01:43:08,683 --> 01:43:10,015
is a beginning

1535
01:43:10,559 --> 01:43:13,802
to consider and accept the other.

1536
01:43:15,773 --> 01:43:19,813
Something must be said,
something relevant, fundamental.

1537
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:25,063
No one has a monopoly on suffering,
Your Honors.

1538
01:43:25,658 --> 01:43:26,774
No one.

1539
01:43:29,995 --> 01:43:33,454
<i>All eyes are on the Court ofAppeals.
The verdict is imminent.</i>

1540
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:36,245
<i>From north to south,</i>

1541
01:43:36,502 --> 01:43:38,710
<i>the army is on high alert...</i>

1542
01:43:38,963 --> 01:43:41,831
<i>The verdict
in the Hanna vs Salameh case...</i>

1543
01:43:42,091 --> 01:43:45,425
<i>A reminder of the tough last two months
the country has been through...</i>

1544
01:43:45,678 --> 01:43:50,719
<i>Judge Colette Mansur allowed the public
to view the proceedings.</i>

1545
01:43:50,975 --> 01:43:55,686
<i>Will the verdict change
Palestinians' situation in Lebanon?</i>

1546
01:43:56,230 --> 01:44:00,941
<i>Could this trial set a precedent
by examining old Civil War wounds?</i>

1547
01:44:01,444 --> 01:44:06,735
<i>Will either side accept or appeal
the decision to the Supreme Court?</i>

1548
01:44:06,991 --> 01:44:10,575
<i>Will this verdict spark
more rioting in the streets?</i>

1549
01:44:10,828 --> 01:44:13,491
<i>This case now closes
after having profoundly rattled Lebanon.</i>

1550
01:44:13,748 --> 01:44:16,957
<i>It has fueled waves of violence</i>

1551
01:44:17,209 --> 01:44:20,202
<i>and brought back
memories of the Civil War.</i>

1552
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:23,042
Judge Colette Mansur presiding.

1553
01:44:23,299 --> 01:44:24,756
All rise!

1554
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:47,483
Plaintiff and defendant, please rise.

1555
01:44:59,168 --> 01:45:01,751
This seems like a cut-and-dry case,

1556
01:45:02,004 --> 01:45:03,666
but in reality it's not.

1557
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:05,414
This is a case

1558
01:45:05,674 --> 01:45:09,293
that involves two people
who each claim to be the victim.

1559
01:45:10,346 --> 01:45:12,929
Words were uttered,
and an assault was committed.

1560
01:45:13,182 --> 01:45:16,391
You each believe you were in the right.

1561
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:21,062
The issue is which of you is at fault,

1562
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:23,307
or more at fault.

1563
01:45:24,193 --> 01:45:26,936
Do the words
outweigh the physical aggression,

1564
01:45:27,196 --> 01:45:29,654
or are they equally incriminating?

1565
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:33,196
Basically,
a physical assault is unacceptable.

1566
01:45:33,452 --> 01:45:35,535
You can't take the law
into your own hands,

1567
01:45:35,788 --> 01:45:40,408
eXcept for clear and imminent danger,
meaning self-defense.

1568
01:45:42,253 --> 01:45:43,585
At the same time,

1569
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:47,874
does an insult carry the same weight
as physical assault,

1570
01:45:48,425 --> 01:45:51,213
when the insult is demeaning
and hurtful?

1571
01:45:52,847 --> 01:45:56,761
At one point, we were tempted
to find you both guilty.

1572
01:45:57,017 --> 01:46:00,601
But based on the evidence
submitted by both lawyers,

1573
01:46:00,855 --> 01:46:04,439
we had to go back to how it all started.

1574
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:08,728
By virtue of majority vote,
two for, and one against,

1575
01:46:09,196 --> 01:46:10,562
this court finds

1576
01:46:10,823 --> 01:46:12,030
Yasser Salameh

1577
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:13,399
not guilty.
