1
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:10,875
Hey!

2
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,208
Hey, you! Wait up!

3
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:14,750
I'm coming! What's wrong?

4
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,500
You had no slip, so I gave you a ticket.

5
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:20,083
Come on, man! A ticket forjust 5 minutes?

6
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:23,917
No, it's been 42 minutes,
and 10 is the limit.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,250
So you get a ticket.

8
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,833
Do you get paid to fuck other people up?

9
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,500
No sir, to monitor parking.

10
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,458
You've been 42 minutes without the slip.

11
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:34,333
Yeah, yeah, you already said that.

12
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:38,083
I was trying to explain
in case you had any doubt.

13
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,000
Any doubt?

14
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:47,917
I see they always hire
the brightest guys for the job.

15
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:52,000
But I've got one too,
and I'm running late.

16
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:13,458
<i>Triple! Oh Ia la, Edwin Jackson!</i>

17
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,667
<i>Triple score!</i>

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,750
- She didn't show up today either?
- No.

19
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:04,250
- Maybe she's sick.
- I don't give a fuck. Get off.

20
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:09,792
Jordi!

21
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,417
Draw a foul, man!

22
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:20,958
You're making a mistake.

23
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:27,583
We're looking for the extra pass!

24
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:31,958
This is no way to win.

25
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,583
Play it long!

26
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:55,375
We're going to play long possession.

27
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:59,000
Ending in 2 on 2
with direct blocking for Jackson.

28
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,875
But he's playing like shit!

29
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,083
Long possession.

30
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:04,917
If we don't score, we hold it.

31
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,167
Here.

32
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,250
First, this attack.
We push to the shot limit.

33
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,083
We play longwise.

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,417
And we end up
with a pick and roll for Jackson.

35
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,542
Understood?

36
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,708
Good. If we don't score, we defend.

37
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:26,167
And shift in every blocking.

38
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,250
Now, Fernéndez...

39
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,917
But how can we defend?
We'll have to make a foul, Paco.

40
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:35,250
Are we the only jerks here
to try and defend this? Fuck!

41
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,792
Sabané, Wilson and Grimau.

42
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,708
To Jackson. It's clear, right?

43
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:43,375
Defence! Defence!

44
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:47,292
Let's go, go, go!
One, two, three, Estu!

45
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,667
He doesn't listen. He thinks he's God.

46
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,125
We're in deep shit, wait and see.

47
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:03,750
- Get to the locker room.
- What?

48
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,292
Go to the locker room.

49
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:07,667
You just turned referee or something?

50
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,125
No, I'm first coach and you're second.

51
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,125
Like it or not,
I'm in charge of this team.

52
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,042
You don't care shit about the team, Paco.

53
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,208
- Get off the court.
- You don't know shit, man.

54
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:18,792
- Get out!
- What the fuck!

55
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,375
CHAMPIONS

56
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,167
<i>Today, pro basketball has shown us
a regrettable picture.</i>

57
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:21,417
<i>During the Movistar Estudiantes
and Tenerife Iberostar match</i>

58
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,583
<i>played this evening,
the well-known coach</i>

59
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:29,292
<i>Francisco Carrascosa
was fiercely pushed</i>

60
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,458
<i>by Marco Monte, second coach.</i>

61
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:34,542
Montes. The name is Marco Montes, shit.

62
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,958
<i>And this is Barcelona's Apollo night club,</i>

63
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:42,958
<i>hosting a single gig by Mermelada,</i>

64
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:46,000
<i>the '80s old rhythm and blues band,</i>

65
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,750
<i>meeting again to celebrate...</i>

66
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:48,708
Another one.

67
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:02,042
Fuck!

68
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,042
Shit! Holy shit.

69
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:12,792
Shit.

70
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,500
What the fuck? No way, no way.

71
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:42,000
Why did you stop there?

72
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,250
Didn't you see me coming?

73
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,958
Marco Montes. Out.

74
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,125
It's about time. I'm late for work.

75
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,875
You bet you are,
you're going to court first.

76
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,750
Aren't you putting your shoes on?

77
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,083
No. What trial are you talking about?

78
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,000
We'll have a quick one.

79
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,500
If you don't mess it up again,
we may be lucky.

80
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,208
But I'd wear the tie.

81
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,708
What do you mean? Who are you?

82
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:29,583
Your lawyer. Glad to meet you too.

83
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,792
- Aren't you coming in?
- No.

84
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,958
I'll take the stairs, if you don't mind.

85
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,583
Mr Monte.

86
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,917
Driving with a blood alcohol content
three times over the limit,

87
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,625
damages to a police vehicle,

88
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,292
injuring, pending assessment,
the officers.

89
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,792
- Resisting arrest.
- No.

90
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,333
I never resisted anybody.

91
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,042
I just asked
for this officer's badge number.

92
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,250
- Keep quiet, please.
-l'm telling the truth.

93
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:58,667
Shall I add contempt of court
to this already heavy list?

94
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,958
Nothing else, Your Honour.

95
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:01,958
I beg your pardon, she's asking me.

96
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,208
Plus verbal abuse against said officers.

97
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:10,375
Besides paying the damages,
and two years without a licence...

98
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,958
Hold on...

99
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,500
It's good enough. Could be worse.

100
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,292
Worse than two years? Listen.

101
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:22,375
I think the sentence is excessive
for driving with just a couple of drinks.

102
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,208
The sentence is yet to come, Mr Monte.

103
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:25,917
- Montes.
- Montes.

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,250
The defendant is facing a prison term
of no less than 18 months.

105
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:34,458
This sentence may be commuted
for community services

106
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:39,333
in a place and for a period
this court will soon let you know.

107
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,958
Court adjourned.

108
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,750
- I told you we'd be lucky.
- What do you mean, lucky?

109
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,667
When will I do that job?
I already have a job.

110
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,667
I'm awfully sorry, Montes.
You leave me no choice.

111
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,583
Look, Mr Chairman, about what happened,

112
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:05,250
I understand it's nothing to be proud of.

113
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:08,083
But everything I do is for the team.

114
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:10,708
You shoved him against the bench
for the team?

115
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:13,500
I didn't shove him,
he lost his balance, that's all.

116
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,083
You tell him, Paco.

117
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,042
Paco, please, tell him.

118
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,125
-I've been warning you.
- About what?

119
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,000
You're the best second I've ever had.

120
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,500
- Why the fuck are we here, then?
- I don't know your personal problems.

121
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,625
Right now you're unfit for the team.

122
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,208
Don't fuck me up.

123
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:33,083
No, you brought it upon yourself.

124
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,917
<i>-I'll</i> be downstairs.
- The decision has been made.

125
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:37,875
You no longer belong to this club.

126
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,417
"The Friends Association."

127
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,875
You'll be working for people
with intellectual disability.

128
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,417
- What the fuck is that?
- Language, Mr Montes!

129
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,083
- Pardon me, Mrs Judge...
-lt's Your Honour.

130
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,125
Pardon me, Your Honour,
but I don't get what you mean.

131
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,250
You're talking about retards?

132
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:03,708
- Your Honour said "language".
- I didn't say "fuck" now.

133
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:05,792
No, it's worse. It's offensive.

134
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,167
For saying "retards"?

135
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,625
Years ago we had Retards Day.

136
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,625
Mongoloids asked for change.

137
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:16,208
I gave them money.
To the mongoloids and the retards.

138
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:22,417
Therefore you'll work for them
the next 90 days.

139
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,833
Ninety days?

140
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,500
- But that's three months.
- Congratulations.

141
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,708
- What for?
- Because I see you can count.

142
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,417
Intellectually disabled?

143
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,750
You mean writers in wheelchairs?

144
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:43,167
Not disabled intellectuals, Mom,
intellectually disabled people.

145
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,208
You mean retards?
So, you're joining in with retards now.

146
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:49,500
- Walter, a glass of wine, please.
- Right away, Mrs Amparo.

147
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,542
Now they're called disabled
because "retards" is offensive.

148
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,958
We always had Retards Day and it was okay.

149
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:01,792
- Like Cancer or AIDS days.
- Well, you can't say that anymore.

150
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,667
No. Not for the boy.

151
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,917
But Why?

152
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,625
-It's like the gay thing.
- What about them?

153
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,542
Now you call them gay.

154
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,875
And how did we use to call them?

155
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,417
Well, fags.

156
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,875
Now, who taught you that language here?

157
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,750
Not me, I'm sure.

158
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,917
- Why don't you answer? It's Sonia.
- Just because.

159
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,083
Well, let me do it then, maybe

160
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:39,000
something's up at the store.

161
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:42,208
Please, forget the store.
I don't want to talk to her, that's all.

162
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,625
You're really messing up everybody's life.

163
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,625
Me? Messing up?

164
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:54,500
You don't know how hard it is for me.

165
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,667
I'd give everything
to see you two make up.

166
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,333
Mom, don't worry about me.

167
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:04,083
No, I'm worried about myself.
I'd like you to go home.

168
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,167
You're invading my space.

169
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,125
They were in such a hurry,
and they haven't even picked it up.

170
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:17,167
They say the police always
comes when you call them.

171
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,833
15 days with these outfits
and nobody's shown up.

172
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:22,833
Like I always say, haste gets you nowhere.

173
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:26,833
I get antsy when they hassle me.

174
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:30,458
A man needs quiet.
Now, where do I stash all this?

175
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,667
I'm putting this here,
but let me tell you,

176
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,083
it's the last time for me.

177
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:38,792
No, and I'm saying no.

178
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,000
Well, well, well.

179
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,375
It's a great honour
that a professional like you

180
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,208
should be interested
in working with our team.

181
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,167
-"Interested" isn't quite the word.
- Neither is "team".

182
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,083
We have an indoor soccer branch
playing several tournaments.

183
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:27,583
I see. Very impressive.

184
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,750
We'd like to take advantage
of you being here a few months

185
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,583
to make you our coach.

186
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:35,375
Yeah, well.
You see, I don't know about indoor soccer.

187
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,042
-L'm a basketball coach.
- Precisely what we need.

188
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,000
A basketball coach.

189
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,792
- You have a basketball branch?
- Sure.

190
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,000
But our coach left.

191
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:47,083
How many days per week should I work?

192
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:48,958
That depends on you.

193
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,125
Excellent. Then one day should be enough.

194
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,083
- Only one day?
- One day is perfect.

195
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,667
Say, one hour.
Not to overload them too much.

196
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:02,458
Well, coming here does a lot
of good to the boys, you know.

197
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:05,750
For them, sport isn't the main thing.

198
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,875
It's more a way
of normalising the situation.

199
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,250
The more they're training here,

200
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,083
the more they socialise,
the happier they are.

201
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:17,542
Don't worry, I'll make them
socialise big time in that hour.

202
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,208
Are all these indoor soccer trophies?

203
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,250
Most are table tennis.
Some ballroom dance trophies too.

204
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,833
Vicky's nephew won some of them.

205
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:32,375
- Vicky?
- Vicky.

206
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,250
- Your friend Victoria.
- My friend Victoria?

207
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:41,292
She said that,
when you knew we needed a coach

208
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,667
you volunteered to help us.

209
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,708
Victoria? It doesn't ring a bell.

210
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:48,125
Sure, Victoria, the judge.

211
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,042
Oh. Yes. Sure. Victoria.

212
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,167
Her nephew's been
more than 10 years with us.

213
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,667
- Her nephew is here?
- Yes.

214
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,458
- What's wrong with him?
- Down syndrome.

215
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,125
- No!
- He has some speech impediment.

216
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,833
But he understands perfectly well.

217
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:06,083
- Jolly good boy.
- He's very excited about you.

218
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,000
We all are.

219
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,917
This is your sports hall?

220
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,542
- Not ours, it's the town's.
- First class.

221
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,167
Apart from the premises,
they give us 1000 euros.

222
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,750
We were really lucky.

223
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,792
- You bet. One grand per month.
- Are you nuts? It's per year.

224
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:23,458
When shall I tell the boys we're starting?

225
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:28,250
Next Monday will be great.
They'll have the rest of the week for...

226
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:31,250
- What?
- What?

227
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,625
I said, for what?

228
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,208
Whatever they do.

229
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,000
It's Victoria.

230
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,958
Yeah, Vicky, how are you?

231
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,583
Yes, he is here, with me.

232
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:51,875
Yes, a very nice lad.

233
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,167
He's starting on Monday.

234
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,250
Yes, only on Mondays.

235
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,833
And just one hour.
The best thing to do, he says.

236
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,042
- Hold on, I'll put him on.
- No.

237
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,917
Just a minute, he's waving his hands.

238
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,042
It's Victoria.

239
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:12,042
Thanks.

240
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,750
Yes, hello?

241
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:18,333
- Your Honour! Inside joke.
- Sure.

242
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:20,250
Yes, I'm listening.

243
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,125
No, I was just telling...

244
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,167
Sure, of course, it's too little.

245
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,125
Way too little.

246
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:32,708
Yes, but...

247
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,375
Yeah, I know.

248
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:41,333
In that case... Sure. No problem.

249
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:45,042
Right. Bye. Yes, I'll put him on.

250
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,708
Yes, Vicky?

251
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,417
Oh, yes? That's great.

252
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,083
That's really great, just fine.

253
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:02,583
All right, Vicky, see you, sweetheart.

254
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,375
- Great, isn't it?
-Indeed.

255
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,792
So then, Tuesdays and Thursdays,
two hours each day.

256
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,042
Great. They will be so happy.

257
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,750
You can't imagine how happy they'll be.

258
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,917
-It's better this way.
- Sure.

259
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,083
Then the Saturday game,
so you won't get bored.

260
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:19,125
Quite so, quite so. Vicky told me. Great.

261
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,458
Marco.

262
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,375
Don't sweat it.
Nobody will know you're here doing time.

263
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,542
And you're just going to love the kids.

264
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,625
My name is Marco Montes.

265
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,000
I'll be your coach
for the next three months.

266
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,708
We'll start with something very simple.

267
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:04,250
You pair up and make two lanes.

268
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,208
We start with a series of passes,
fakes and shots.

269
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,292
Then we'll change positions. Understood?

270
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,667
Fantastic.

271
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,917
Okay, let's see how you move.

272
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,000
Sorry!

273
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,375
Everybody pick a partner.

274
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:44,167
- I have a girlfriend.
- Liar! You don't.

275
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,000
Yes I do. I have two.

276
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,333
No, you don't.
She just changes her hairstyle.

277
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:51,208
- They're different.
- No, she's the same.

278
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:54,875
- Just pick a partner.
- But I already have one.

279
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,458
- She's a whore.
- Hey, you!

280
00:19:57,292 --> 00:19:59,333
- She's a whore.
- Okay, she's a whore.

281
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:02,208
But she's my girlfriend.
Can't a whore have a boyfriend?

282
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:04,583
She can, but if I paid her,
she'd be my girlfriend.

283
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,333
- Well, pay her.
- Yeah, right.

284
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:09,167
-L'm not paying your bitch any.
- I play small forward.

285
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,333
L... L.-

286
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,167
I'm centre, I got that down.

287
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:17,958
Well, all right.

288
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:22,458
Step by step. You two
with the girlfriend, get over here.

289
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:28,875
Grab a ball.

290
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:30,958
Just one.

291
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,625
- You, in red, grab a ball.
- Coming!

292
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,208
No, no! Not you. I'm talking to them.

293
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:39,750
You just wait. Get a ball.

294
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:50,458
- What's wrong?
- Just an absence.

295
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,000
He lost it.

296
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,792
- What do you mean?
- He's benumbed.

297
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,125
We have to wait.

298
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:58,917
- What for?
- For him to come back.

299
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,292
- Where from?
- From the seizure.

300
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,042
That's it.

301
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,958
Well, er... take the ball.

302
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,667
You run to the basket, passing...

303
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:19,208
Where are you going?

304
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:21,750
- Where are you going?
- Didn't you say to play ball?

305
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,625
No, I said...

306
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,500
- What's your name?
- Jesús Lago Solis.

307
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:27,417
Good.

308
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,458
But all my friends call me Jesús
because it's shorter.

309
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:33,375
- Okay, Jesús.
- Jesús Iago Solis.

310
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,250
Okay, I get it, Jesús.

311
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,958
- And what's your name?
- My name is Marco, Jesús.

312
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:40,542
- Hey, like me. Jesús.
- No, just Marco.

313
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,583
In fact my name is Jesús Lagos Solis.

314
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,750
Right. Perfect. My name is Marco.

315
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,042
Didn't you say your name was Jesús too?

316
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,958
No, I was talking to you, Jesús.

317
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,083
Jesús Iago Solis, actually.

318
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:53,125
Well, my name is Marco! All right?

319
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,458
- Now, we're...
-l'm Sergio.

320
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:59,833
That's swell. Jesús and Sergio,
this is what we're going to do.

321
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:01,875
- You get paired up...
- I already am.

322
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,875
I know that! Just forget her
for a little while, okay?

323
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,708
How could I? It wouldn't be nice.

324
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,750
You'll play with her later.
Play with us now.

325
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,208
I don't play with her. We just fuck.

326
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:13,042
I told you. ls she a whore or what?

327
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,250
I go to her place, we have
a few drinks and do all sorts of stuff.

328
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:23,250
All right. Very good. Jesús and Sergio...

329
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:27,333
- Sergio Costa is my name.
- She's trampy. Be honest.

330
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,875
- Jesús and Sergio Costa.
- Zorrilla.

331
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:34,083
- Forget your girl, okay?
- No, that's my family name.

332
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:35,417
Sergio Costa Zorrilla.

333
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:41,917
Okay, I'm sorry. Jesús and...

334
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,042
- Jesús Iago Solis.
- Jesús Iago Solis!

335
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,833
And Sergio Costa Zorrilla!
You get paired up...

336
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:47,833
Look at him.

337
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,875
- What's up with your shoes?
- They match the headguard.

338
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,500
Next time bring sport shoes.

339
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:25,458
You don't need the guard either.

340
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:26,875
Well, I don't know.

341
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:32,125
I'm so excited, coach! Hug me!

342
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:37,125
You're a good man. You're doing great.

343
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,042
Yeah, but he is too short for basketball.

344
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,000
- Very short.
- He's not.

345
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:45,750
He just hasn't shot up yet.

346
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,458
So he's a dwarf.

347
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,625
It's impossible.

348
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:58,208
It'll be over before you know it.

349
00:23:58,292 --> 00:24:01,250
I mean, making a team
out of these people. No way.

350
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,958
It's not impossible.
Difficult but not impossible.

351
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,292
They don't even know to pass the ball.

352
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,875
<i>You' re the coach.
Teach them. That's your 'yob.</i>

353
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,750
Pardon me.
My job is to train normal players.

354
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,250
These are not players.
And they're not normal.

355
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,708
Who's normal, Marco?
You and me, are we normal?

356
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,375
You don't have to turn them
into the Lakers.

357
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,583
They don't even have to play well.

358
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:26,625
Just help them feel like a team.

359
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,042
Coaches come and go.

360
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,542
- But this is their life.
- It can't be that bad.

361
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,292
The last one left a month ago.

362
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:37,375
We had just registered
for the regional league.

363
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:40,208
- Too bad. You could even win.
- Maybe not.

364
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:42,667
But they were terribly excited.
Can you imagine

365
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:47,750
how they felt when I told them
we were out for lack of a trainer?

366
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:54,958
- I can't promise anything.
- I don't ask for guarantees.

367
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:58,542
Just don't throw in the towel. They won't.

368
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:03,750
How can I teach them to score?
They can't even run.

369
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,417
Well, that's a starting point.

370
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,792
Say, I was thinking,
what's going on with your wife?

371
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:23,458
We're not in a sweet spot.
We haven't spoken in days.

372
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:27,750
It's better this way.
I don't want her to know.

373
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,000
But did you split or what?

374
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:33,500
Fuck, what a shame. She's so hot.

375
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,667
She cheated on you, did she?

376
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,417
What are you talking about?

377
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,750
Then you were the cheater? Fuck!

378
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:43,125
No, it's nothing like that.

379
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,833
I don't get it, then. What's the trouble?

380
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,500
She just wants this and I want that.

381
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:50,875
Perhaps she deserves
a better man than me.

382
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,083
Yeah, well, she's really super-hot.

383
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:58,042
Hey, pardon me, but you're talking
about my wife, you know?

384
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:01,083
Just trying to cheer you up, Montes.
More than that. Live it up.

385
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:02,833
- How?
- Loosening up.

386
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:05,167
My brother-in-law had a quick trial too.

387
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,250
He got the Greenpeace boat
full of Norwegian volunteer girls.

388
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,417
The pictures are unbelievable.

389
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:16,417
You follow me. In a straight line.
No drifting away.

390
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:20,375
All right? Let's start slow
and then peel rubber.

391
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:23,833
- Peel what?
- I mean, run faster.

392
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,542
Now, you follow the line.

393
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,042
Straight?

394
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:36,792
Excuse me?

395
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:41,292
What Paquito means is whether we

396
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:45,583
follow a straight line

397
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:50,917
or should we change direction?

398
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:53,375
I mean

399
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:57,542
if we should turn left, or...

400
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:59,708
Yeah, yeah, right. Let's go.

401
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:05,833
We breathe through the nose,
filling our lungs.

402
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,583
We slowly release our breath
through the mouth.

403
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:13,500
One, two. One, two.

404
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:17,125
One, two. One, two.

405
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:20,208
One, two. One, two.

406
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,917
One, two. One, two.

407
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,333
Where are your mates?

408
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,792
You're the judge's nephew, right?

409
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,292
- Mrs Judge, could we talk?
- I have no time for you.

410
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,833
I can't go on training these... people.

411
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:20,667
- You'd rather go to prison?
- No,no!

412
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,458
<i>-I'll</i> get it started.
-'Course not!

413
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:24,833
How about a fine? You name the amount.

414
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:27,125
I already did. Ninety days.

415
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,500
Your Honour, I beg your pardon.

416
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:34,000
Isn't there anything else I can do?

417
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:36,708
Sure there is.
But this is what you have to do.

418
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:38,250
Now please, I'm very busy.

419
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:43,792
Some coincidence I was sent
to the association where your nephew is!

420
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:47,083
I mean it's obviously a coincidence.

421
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:51,042
You wouldn't take advantage
of the situation. Would you?

422
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:55,583
Yes. It's a coincidence.
I'm not in charge of the assignments.

423
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,500
- I see.
-l'd have sent you

424
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:59,083
to the quadriplegic ward in Toledo.

425
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:01,583
You'd find loads of people in wheelchairs

426
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:04,000
due to other people
driving with just two drinks.

427
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,542
- Yes, hello?
- Marco?

428
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,000
- What's up?
- Marco.

429
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,250
<i>Great news! We're selected!</i>

430
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:47,417
<i>- What? Where, Julio?
- For the National Series.</i>

431
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,167
<i>And as we have a coach, and precisely you,</i>

432
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:55,083
<i>they let us sign up. We're in!</i>

433
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:58,500
Julio, it's 6:30 a.m.

434
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,500
Do you think it's news time?

435
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:04,625
<i>Yeah, sorry I didn't call earlier,
you could have been sleeping, you know.</i>

436
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:08,208
<i>The National Series, Marco!
Countrywide!</i>

437
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,958
- Terrific, <i>right?</i>
- Sure. Terribly terrific.

438
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:15,875
<i>Marco?</i>

439
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:23,292
I'm telling you
I'm taking the holiday off.

440
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:25,208
I don't care who thinks it's wrong.

441
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:31,583
And if, on the holiday, my days off,
I want to go to my hometown, I'll go.

442
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:34,250
If I want to stay here, I'll stay here.

443
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,958
Maybe I want to stay.
I'll decide what to do those days.

444
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:40,667
Sorry. Sonia!

445
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:44,042
What a surprise! How are you doing?

446
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:45,708
Fine.

447
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,583
When Marco told me about you two,
I couldn't believe it.

448
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,708
I can't remember who you are.

449
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:53,958
Iván.

450
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:59,125
Iván Bajero. Marco's mate.
We've seen each other a thousand times.

451
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:00,042
From the team, Estu.

452
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,792
- How are you?
- Great, doing great.

453
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:04,833
I didn't recognise you
without the tracksuit.

454
00:31:05,042 --> 00:31:08,792
Although now we're ex-teammates,
like you two.

455
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:10,667
- You're no longer at the club.
- I am.

456
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,833
But Marco isn't.

457
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:16,875
He didn't tell you?
It's been some days now.

458
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:22,208
I know, he told me you two
weren't doing great.

459
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,167
He hasn't told you about the retards then.

460
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,125
- Sorry?
- Yeah, the sentence

461
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:29,375
for driving, you know...

462
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,167
- Fuck me!
- And they took away his licence.

463
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,375
He must have told you, right?
Sorry for the bad news.

464
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,542
But he's doing okay.
Maybe I can help you out, Sonia.

465
00:31:40,042 --> 00:31:43,458
Would you like to go out for a drink
sometime, and let off steam?

466
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:44,500
Do you know where he is?

467
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:45,458
No idea.

468
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:47,458
- Do you see him, Julián?
-lván.

469
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:50,500
It's lván. I'll give you my card.

470
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,208
We're meeting next Saturday.

471
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:54,917
- Where?
- At Kiss.

472
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:57,458
- Don't tell him I'll be there.
- I won't.

473
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:09,875
SATURDAY'S PLAN CANCELLED
SEE YOU ANOTHER DAY

474
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:21,375
MARCO MONTES - FROM ESTUDIANTES
TO DISABLED PLAYERS

475
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,750
Well, it looks like you're playing
a tournament.

476
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,333
And to compete means to win.

477
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,167
And I like to win. Always.

478
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:45,958
In order to win, you'll have to give me
everything you've got.

479
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,292
I can't give you my Play.
I haven't finished FIFA yet.

480
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,208
- What play?
- The PlayStation.

481
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:53,542
- No, you keep it, Jesús.
- All right.

482
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:54,875
Got it, you guys?

483
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,375
- So-so.
- Enough.

484
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:00,833
Let's play some tactics.
Starting where we left off.

485
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:03,375
In couples, two lanes, bank shots.

486
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,292
Come on, guys, get paired up.

487
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:16,167
Okay, Juanma and Benito, right?

488
00:33:16,417 --> 00:33:17,750
What about us?

489
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:21,708
Yeah, relax. We'll watch these two first
and then we all do it.

490
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,875
- What are you doing?
- Stretching.

491
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,000
I'm warming up.

492
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:32,625
- Should we do the same?
- No, no, wait.

493
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:35,333
We already warmed up.
Let's repeat what we did last day.

494
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,042
Juanma, come here.

495
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,250
With the ball, man.

496
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,250
Run forward, bounce it twice
and pass it to Benito.

497
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,375
- He'll do the same.
- Coach! A hug!

498
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,708
- No, don't hug me. Later.
- All right.

499
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,875
- Like that?
- No, not really. But it's okay.

500
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,208
Now, take a ball each and train.

501
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,292
You with me, Manuel.

502
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:46,167
- What are you doing?
- A bank shot.

503
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,250
- You really think you can score?
- Can't I?

504
00:34:58,333 --> 00:34:59,792
Good shot, bro!

505
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:24,292
Look, Romén.

506
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:28,208
You're the only one
who seems able to play here.

507
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,417
And I know you're the brightest
by a long shot.

508
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,792
Which is not so hard, actually.

509
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:39,917
The thing is... we'll never win
a damn game with this team.

510
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:43,292
But I don't want to look stupid.

511
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,958
That's why I need you to play with us.

512
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:04,333
Coach, I have a problem.

513
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:08,792
- Welcome to my world, Marin.
- Thank you very much.

514
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,958
- What's wrong with you?
- With me?

515
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:16,292
I have 39 per cent disability
due to complications during childbirth.

516
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,875
- So? Can't you play?
- Yes, I can.

517
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:24,750
- Well, then?
- Since you asked

518
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,625
-what was wrong.
- No,no,no.

519
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:29,250
You told me you had a problem,
so I asked you.

520
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:31,917
Right. I went to the doctor yesterday.

521
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,083
He said I have a slight spinal deviation.

522
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,833
- So you can't play?
- I can.

523
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:41,292
It's very slight.
In fact he advised me to play.

524
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:42,833
So?

525
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:47,417
I'll have to attend a massage
therapist for some days.

526
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,667
- And it overlaps with training hours?
- No.

527
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,250
I'll go in the mornings.

528
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,750
- So, what is the problem?
- So what is what?

529
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:58,917
What is the problem, Marin?
What is it?

530
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,375
Well, these are new shoes.

531
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:04,375
They hurt a lot.

532
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,958
- Change them.
- I didn't keep the receipt.

533
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:11,542
No, I mean switch between feet.

534
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:18,250
- I can't do it if I'm standing.
- Sit down, please, and do it.

535
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:34,625
Wow, fuck! That's a lot better!

536
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,083
You see?

537
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:39,792
So much better!

538
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:42,583
I'm a bit dyslexic, you know.

539
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:45,250
Don't think I'm dumb.

540
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,833
No, I never said that.

541
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:52,167
I know you said I was the brightest
when I gave you the ticket.

542
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:56,292
But some call me a dumbass
because they don't know me.

543
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,625
Marquito.

544
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,250
- What are you doing?
- Checking if you've been drinking.

545
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:33,875
Mom, I have enough problems as it is.

546
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,125
Have you won any games yet?

547
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:38,583
- We haven't played yet.
- Well, you will.

548
00:38:39,292 --> 00:38:41,167
Do you think I care if they win or not?

549
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,542
You should, it's your team.

550
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:49,375
Remember that coach
that said you couldn't be a pro

551
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,167
because you weren't tall enough?

552
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,208
- He had no idea.
- Oh yes. Yes, he had.

553
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,208
He had no idea.

554
00:38:57,292 --> 00:39:00,083
I remember I went to see him
and smacked him in the face.

555
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:02,792
You did What?

556
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,500
No wonder they sacked me.

557
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:07,792
No, they sacked you because you're short.

558
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:10,417
And he couldn't see how gifted you are.

559
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,833
How do you know? You never came.
You never saw me playing.

560
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:16,958
The world is full of short people
with huge achievements.

561
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:18,417
Without their mothers watching.

562
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:21,292
- Oh, yeah? Like who?
- Julius Caesar, for one.

563
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:22,458
Julius Caesar was small?

564
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:25,167
- We don't know.
- Who do we know about then?

565
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:26,917
Marco, you'd better sleep it off.

566
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:31,000
And don't puke on the sheets.
You don't have a plastic sheet any longer.

567
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:34,167
If you keep cheering me up like this,
I'd better go to a hotel.

568
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:38,292
Son, don't say that.

569
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:41,167
Don't get my hopes up.

570
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,625
Bend your knees. Rump out.

571
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,625
Good, Fabién. That's perfect.

572
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:55,000
Marin, I said the right hand.

573
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:57,167
I have tendinitis.

574
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:01,083
All right. Use your left.

575
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:04,542
-L'm just saying.
- Go ahead.

576
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,292
Good, Benito, very good.

577
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:09,458
Switch hands as you walk.

578
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,000
Then we'll get on to the passes, okay?

579
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:13,875
And how do you do that?

580
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:17,542
You throw it to me and I throw it to you.

581
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,542
Easy, right?
- Hey!

582
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:22,458
Why did you throw the ball at me?

583
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:25,708
- A hug!
- Okay, back in place.

584
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:31,000
- Maybe he broke your nose.
- I don't think so, Marin.

585
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,542
I broke mine three times
and I have sinusitis.

586
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,708
- Oh, dear.
- And asthma.

587
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:39,333
- Is there something you don't have?
- Fibromyalgia, I think.

588
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:42,208
But sometimes I have migraines
and see light flashes.

589
00:40:42,292 --> 00:40:43,875
He's a hypochondriac.

590
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:47,125
They prescribed me that too,
hypochondriac.

591
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:50,917
Anybody seen Romén?

592
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:52,333
No.

593
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,083
- He quit the team.
- What do you mean he quit?

594
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:57,500
Only he knew how to play.

595
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:00,833
- Come on, they all play.
- See you on Thursday.

596
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,375
No, they don't.
They can't even bounce the ball once

597
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:11,417
without travelling or doing things
I've never seen but are illegal anyway.

598
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:15,583
Take this kid.
His lack of coordination is supreme.

599
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:19,208
He can't walk four steps with the ball
under control. He'll never...

600
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:23,083
Holy shit!

601
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:30,500
What's this moron up to?

602
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,958
Sorry, but he could kill himself.
Or worse, kill someone.

603
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:36,708
- He's never had an accident. Have you?
- Me?

604
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:39,417
All right. But that nutcase...

605
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:43,583
That nutcase, as you call him,
lives on his own.

606
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:45,333
<i>He has no family.</i>

607
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:56,167
<i>He wakes up at 4:00
and goes to work in a kitchen.</i>

608
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:05,208
<i>Fabién isn't as self-reliant.</i>

609
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:08,208
<i>He lives in a monitored
home with three roommates.</i>

610
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:11,250
<i>Every morning he goes
to a gardening workshop</i>

611
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:13,625
<i>where he's got the idea
of speaking with the plants.</i>

612
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:15,958
<i>Don't think he's nice to them, though.</i>

613
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:17,083
<i>He scolds them.</i>

614
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,958
I want you to keep quiet!

615
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:22,167
Or else! And you, shut up, you devil!

616
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:25,542
Look howl bounce it. Good, huh?

617
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:28,583
<i>Jesús works at a vocational centre</i>

618
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:32,333
<i>where he disassembles
and reassembles engines.</i>

619
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,417
<i>He's so good a mechanic</i>

620
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:39,333
<i>trainees go there
just to watch him work.</i>

621
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,708
<i>He calls them followers.</i>

622
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:44,917
<i>He's fond of music, too.</i>

623
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,667
<i>He plays with his band on Sundays.</i>

624
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,500
<i>They all have a story.</i>

625
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:06,583
<i>Some got stuck in their childhood.</i>

626
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,708
<i>Others didn't mature
in their mothers' wombs.</i>

627
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:12,000
<i>Or suffered during childbirth.</i>

628
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:18,542
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

629
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,208
This dye is leaking.

630
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,583
Look, since I can't pay you overtime,
you keep it.

631
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:28,750
- So you get something out of it.
- All right.

632
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,667
That's why he dyes his hair.

633
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,250
- Hey.
- What's up.

634
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,958
Hey, beautiful! Beautiful doggie!

635
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:44,833
-It's a she.
- Beautiful!

636
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:47,792
<i>Juanma works at a cats and dogs home.
He loves animals.</i>

637
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,000
<i>And they let him live there.</i>

638
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:52,750
- That's why he stinks.
- No, he almost drowned

639
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:56,792
when he was a boy and now he hates water.
He hardly washes up.

640
00:43:57,083 --> 00:44:00,625
Well, I'd pull him by the ears
under the shower.

641
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:03,833
It doesn't work like that.
He has to do it of his own will.

642
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,083
His problem is fear, not the stink.

643
00:44:06,917 --> 00:44:08,958
- Good evening, Julio.
- Good evening.

644
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:10,292
Good evening, coach.

645
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:13,625
- Thank you for everything.
- Thank you, Marin.

646
00:44:18,042 --> 00:44:20,833
Dear me, this is very worrying.

647
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:24,958
The 19:45 flight Madrid-Rome

648
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:26,625
is late.

649
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:29,458
I can't figure it out.
There's chaos in the air.

650
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:33,542
And this looks normal to you, right?

651
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:37,917
Some people stay days on end
behind a bush watching birds.

652
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,375
They call them ornithologists, not fools.

653
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:42,208
Everything's relative.

654
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:44,542
Say, Julio, what about Romén?

655
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,625
Romén is another story.

656
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:51,208
"Ask me for anything
except the camper van.

657
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:53,833
No. I'm not lending you the van."

658
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:56,750
And she didn't like it.
But my camper van is spotless.

659
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:59,417
It sleeps in a garage.
I feed it 98 octane gas.

660
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,375
It's a bit more expensive,
but it's good for the engine.

661
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,917
No, I'm not lending her the camper.
Or anybody.

662
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,250
But why not? She's your sister.

663
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:11,375
Why? She'd grate the gears
and spoil the engine.

664
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,500
My camper is like a collector's item.

665
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,000
It's just a piece of junk on four wheels.

666
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:20,875
Look here. I could say
you're a piece of meat on two limbs.

667
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:23,375
Even though it's true,
I guess you wouldn't like it.

668
00:45:24,042 --> 00:45:25,833
Would you lend it to me, Antonio?

669
00:45:25,917 --> 00:45:28,000
I would, yes.
Because I know you'll never ask.

670
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:33,333
Okay, boys, listen up.

671
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:36,917
Saturday we play our first official game.

672
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,792
- And we play at home.
- Whose home?

673
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:42,667
Not mine. We don't fit, it's too small.

674
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,875
No, I mean in our sports hall.

675
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:48,500
Before the game,
I'll tell you the starting line-up.

676
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,417
But relax, you will all play.

677
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,500
But only five can play, coach.

678
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,125
I know, but we'll rotate during the game.

679
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:57,292
One of the players
will pull out and be replaced.

680
00:45:57,917 --> 00:45:59,375
What about the others?

681
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:01,167
What do you mean?

682
00:46:01,542 --> 00:46:04,458
If one comes in and one comes out,
only six will play.

683
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,208
- You will all play.
- But only five can play.

684
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:11,625
We'll attend to that on Saturday, okay?

685
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:14,917
I don't know if I can play anyway, coach.

686
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:17,292
Why not?

687
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:21,083
I have an unexpected pain in the neck.
I think I have spasms.

688
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:23,042
Don't worry,
you won't have them on Saturday.

689
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:27,542
- But what if I do?
- We'll think of something, Marin.

690
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:30,500
I know, but the situation
makes me anxious.

691
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:32,208
- Anxious.
- Huh?

692
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,708
- And Romén isn't with us anymore.
- Don't remind me.

693
00:46:36,792 --> 00:46:38,750
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

694
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:44,083
Julio told me you received two outfits.

695
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:46,042
One blue, one red.

696
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:48,792
Next Saturday,
you'll bring the blue one, okay?

697
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:50,833
But red is kind of cooler than blue.

698
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:53,083
Yes, but the other team will wear red.

699
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:57,000
Our home kit is blue.
So, on Saturday, all in blue.

700
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:58,833
What if my girl comes to watch?

701
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:01,417
- She's a bitch, what does she care?
- Okay, but she likes red.

702
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,167
She'll probably say,
"My Sergio is so cute in blue."

703
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:09,500
My girlfriend is not that corny.
She's more in the filthy business.

704
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:11,167
We'd better all dress the same.

705
00:47:11,542 --> 00:47:13,917
Because red is real cool.

706
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,875
What? ls your girl coming too?

707
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:20,333
No, my mother.
She won't make me out in blue.

708
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:23,417
Oh, yes, your mother will. Don't worry.

709
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,958
- Are your parents coming?
- Right! Tell them to.

710
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:41,000
In blue. Saturday everybody in blue.

711
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:49,542
- Hey, man.
- Howdy.

712
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,042
Didn't I tell you all to wear blue?

713
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:16,167
- Blue!
- You said red, coach.

714
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,500
- No.
- No, he said blue.

715
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:19,458
So why the fuck are you in red too?

716
00:48:19,542 --> 00:48:22,667
It suits me better and you know it.
I can read your mind.

717
00:48:23,542 --> 00:48:26,250
I'm colour-blind,
so I don't know what I'm wearing.

718
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:29,208
Besides, blue T-shirts are for faggots.

719
00:48:30,417 --> 00:48:33,542
That's not a T-shirt, it's a polo shirt.

720
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:37,625
That's worse.
Little polos are for double faggots.

721
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:43,917
Okay, let's see.
First to play will be Manuel,

722
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:46,625
- Fabién, Paquito...
- Yeah!

723
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:49,250
Me, me, me!

724
00:48:50,417 --> 00:48:51,792
But where's Benito?

725
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:53,500
He couldn't make it, he's got to work.

726
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:55,833
Blue.

727
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,375
He said he'd asked his boss.

728
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:02,125
His boss is an asshole, he laughs at him.
Benito told me so.

729
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:06,083
Okay, let's focus. Manuel.

730
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,667
Fabién.

731
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:12,292
-L'm reading a book.
- How do you like it?

732
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:16,042
- Fine. But I liked the movie better.
- Great.

733
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,417
- And Juanma.
- Yeah!

734
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,292
Hand your shirt over to Sergio.

735
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:24,292
I'm not wearing his shirt for the world.

736
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:26,667
- Then you don't play. It's up to you.
- Blue.

737
00:49:29,042 --> 00:49:30,875
- And Jesús.
- Yes!

738
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:33,833
And in red.
So my mother will recognise me.

739
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:46,875
Who told you to wear that rag?
You look ridiculous!

740
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:48,750
It's me, Mommy.

741
00:49:57,583 --> 00:50:00,833
Throw the ball. That's it! Great!

742
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:04,292
We play and pass. We pass and move.

743
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:07,458
Good, Paula.

744
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:12,542
Boys, keep the timing in cut and block.

745
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:14,958
Paquito, we don't force the shot.

746
00:50:15,042 --> 00:50:17,125
We look for the extra pass. Come on!

747
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:20,458
- What is he talking about?
- Beats me. Basketball stuff, I'd say.

748
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:23,958
Come on, boys, always press
the player with the ball.

749
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:25,042
Don't let him think!

750
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:27,375
Fabién, pick and roll for Sergio.

751
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:29,333
- Rock'n'roll what?
- Pick and roll!

752
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,208
It's not that hard.

753
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,208
Next day, whoever hasn't the right outfit
does not play. Understood?

754
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:42,667
Perfectly. When you speak clearly,
I catch everything.

755
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,875
Now, you get ready to play.

756
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,542
Me? Oh, well, thank you so much.

757
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:58,750
You, Niki Lauda,
you scrubbing that pot for ever?

758
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:02,042
You don't have to make it shine,
just wipe off the shit.

759
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:03,833
You never catch a thing.

760
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:07,167
Afterwards, dump the trash and mop
the floor. And don't gawk at me.

761
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,542
You said I could go to the game.

762
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:12,625
Stop busting my ass
with this basketball shit, all right?

763
00:51:12,917 --> 00:51:15,542
I give you work,
and you're nothing but a shirker.

764
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:18,042
Move your asses, you fuckers!

765
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:21,208
Or else, scram!
I got lots of people wanting your job!

766
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,125
Hey, you!

767
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:50,250
What are you doing here?

768
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:53,667
I should be asking that question, lván.
You said you couldn't come.

769
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:56,583
Well, in the end I could.

770
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:57,875
Yeah, I can see that.

771
00:51:57,958 --> 00:51:59,625
And why are you here?

772
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:02,708
Hell, I came for a drink. Can't I?

773
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:04,708
You can, of course you can.

774
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,667
Why are you so dressed up?

775
00:52:14,042 --> 00:52:15,292
Fuck me...

776
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:16,417
No...

777
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:18,917
Just my luck. Of all the bars...

778
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,792
I'd better let you two discuss matters.

779
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:29,833
- Hi, Marco.
- Hi, Sonia. How come you're here?

780
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:33,250
- I came to see you.
- How did you know I was here?

781
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:36,042
Your friend told me.
The one that just left.

782
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:37,625
Iván.

783
00:52:38,292 --> 00:52:39,708
Why don't you answer my calls?

784
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:42,000
What calls? I didn't see any.

785
00:52:42,208 --> 00:52:44,583
I was worried.
I thought your accident was serious.

786
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:46,750
- No, it was nothing, really.
- Nothing?

787
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:49,583
Iván said you got fired
from the club, stood trial,

788
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,083
and were convicted
to train some disabled people.

789
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:58,417
What will it be?

790
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:02,875
- Gin and tonic for me.
- Why do you hide, Marco?

791
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:06,833
I don't. I just didn't feel like talking
and I still don't.

792
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,792
How can we solve our problems then?

793
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:10,292
What problems, Sonia?

794
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:12,667
You tell me. You're the one who left.

795
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:24,417
-L'd sooner leave than be kicked out.
- What?

796
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:27,208
I'd rather leave before you wanted me out.

797
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:32,208
Why do you say that?

798
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:34,000
I like you.

799
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:53,458
I'd love to have a baby with your eyes.

800
00:53:59,792 --> 00:54:02,083
You're here to bring up the subject,
aren't you?

801
00:54:03,417 --> 00:54:04,833
Hey, can I have my gin and tonic?

802
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,042
You're always on the run.

803
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,875
- You always run away.
- What?

804
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:11,667
Like a child. You're like Peter Pan.

805
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,583
You're a shrink now, or what?

806
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:17,125
No need to be one to see
you're going nowhere.

807
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:19,458
Hear Penélope Cruz talking.
Big time actress

808
00:54:19,542 --> 00:54:23,583
ends up working
at her mother-in-law's store.

809
00:54:28,292 --> 00:54:31,417
- It wasn't a good idea to come.
- No, it wasn't.

810
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,583
Listen, boys. Draw a circle around me.

811
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:01,333
When I say a name, the guy with the ball

812
00:56:01,417 --> 00:56:03,583
will pass it to the guy I mentioned, okay?

813
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,833
And when I'll say "bank shot",

814
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:09,875
the man with the ball shoots.

815
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:11,625
- Understood?
- Yes.

816
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:13,167
- Understood?
- Yes.

817
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:14,250
Very good.

818
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:18,917
We have to wait?

819
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,583
No. I was looking
at the bird that just flew in.

820
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:23,750
I love birds.

821
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:25,458
Me too, I eat a lot of chicken.

822
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:30,667
Fabién, come on. Go, Jesús.
Sergio. Marin.

823
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:35,083
Manuel. Fabién. Very good.

824
00:56:35,167 --> 00:56:38,875
Benito. Paquito, Paquito. Jesús.

825
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:42,625
Watch out, man! Come on, Sergio.

826
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:48,292
Careful, there. Marin. Juanma.

827
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:50,292
That's it. Bank shot!

828
00:56:58,292 --> 00:56:59,500
Very good!

829
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,625
- Give me a hug, coach.
- No.

830
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:06,958
First the shower, then the hugs.
Come on, shower, everybody!

831
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:35,083
You told him we have a game in Cuenca?

832
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:36,875
- I did.
- What did he say?

833
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:39,167
Not... not...

834
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,667
-not to bust his balls.
- Nice.

835
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,958
- Juanma.
- Yes?

836
00:57:45,208 --> 00:57:47,792
- Shower.
- I don't believe in showers.

837
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:49,333
What does that mean?

838
00:57:49,417 --> 00:57:50,792
- He doesn't.
- I think...

839
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:55,458
I think he'll say yes, because
I'd like it very much. But I have...

840
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:58,083
- I have this doubt.
- What doubt?

841
00:57:58,167 --> 00:57:59,167
This doubt.

842
00:57:59,667 --> 00:58:01,625
Take it easy. It'll be all right.

843
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,375
Any other doubt, you ask me.

844
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:05,583
Hey, hey, hey, a rat!

845
00:58:12,542 --> 00:58:13,917
It's a little mouse.

846
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:17,583
Save it, coach! Save it, save it!

847
00:58:18,625 --> 00:58:19,833
Keep cool. Let's see.

848
00:58:30,417 --> 00:58:33,042
- Where is it?
- Gone down the drain.

849
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:34,625
Then he's drowning, for sure.

850
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:37,000
Yes, it's too narrow, he doesn't fit.

851
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:39,000
Save him, coach, save him!

852
00:58:47,417 --> 00:58:50,083
Juanma... you save him.

853
00:58:50,292 --> 00:58:53,917
You're good with animals.
You're the man for the job, Juanma.

854
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:57,208
The mouse needs you or he'll drown,
Juanma.

855
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,958
The mouse needs someone like you, Juanma.

856
00:59:00,542 --> 00:59:04,292
Someone answering his call for help.
He's yelling your name.

857
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,792
Juanma! Juanma! Juanma!

858
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,042
Only you can do it, Juanma.

859
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:15,708
Come on, he's drowning, come on.

860
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:19,875
That's it guys, that's it, team work.

861
00:59:20,292 --> 00:59:23,625
Coordination. Helping one another.

862
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:26,875
Get Juanma off the key. Come on, go, go.

863
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:29,417
Where is he? You find him, Juanma.

864
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,583
- Where is the mouse? Find him.
- I can't.

865
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:35,417
- Look for him.
- Come out, cutie, come out!

866
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,958
Come out!

867
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:41,792
- Come out, sweetie! I can't see him.
- Get up, Juanma.

868
00:59:42,292 --> 00:59:43,375
Get up.

869
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:51,250
The mouse is hiding.
He wants us to be clean.

870
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:53,792
He wants us to be clean.

871
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:57,667
Careful not to get fungi.

872
01:00:04,417 --> 01:00:06,708
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

873
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:09,458
Come on, Juanma. Use the soap.

874
01:00:09,542 --> 01:00:10,750
That's right.

875
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,500
See that guys? That's how
you overcome your fears. In one go.

876
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:37,542
Do you believe in showers now?

877
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:39,333
Give me a hug, coach!

878
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:57,125
I have one doubt.

879
01:00:58,917 --> 01:00:59,792
What is it?

880
01:01:00,208 --> 01:01:01,792
How are we going to Cuenca?

881
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,833
You go to the bus station
and take the coach to Cuenca.

882
01:01:06,417 --> 01:01:08,417
It'll leave you
within 300 yards of the hall.

883
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,083
What? We're using a public bus?

884
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,583
Yeah, unless you want a navy chopper.

885
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:14,542
But who's coming with me?

886
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:18,000
The players, naturally.
You and the players. Who else?

887
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:20,833
- Who's looking after them?
- They'll manage by themselves.

888
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:25,958
Of course, out of their hood
some may act a little offbeat.

889
01:01:26,042 --> 01:01:30,208
Some? They all act offbeat, Julio,
all the time, everywhere.

890
01:01:30,292 --> 01:01:32,333
No, not in their own surroundings.

891
01:01:32,417 --> 01:01:34,667
Look, this is your stop. Get out.

892
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:42,958
See you.

893
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:51,667
I knew I had great news for you.
Collantes.

894
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,500
- What's that?
- Our new transfer, Collantes.

895
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:58,667
Quite big.
Romén's replacement. Collantes.

896
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:25,375
You're neat as a pin, eh, Juanma?

897
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:28,625
I put baby powder

898
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:31,583
-in both armpits and feet.
- And your outfit?

899
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:34,417
- Can't be in that bag.
- I got it here.

900
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:40,500
Shit, Juanma! I said it
a thousand times, the red one!

901
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:41,917
- Red.
- Yes, red's here.

902
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,667
I took both just in case.

903
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:50,208
Okay, very good. Perfect.
What's in the bag, then?

904
01:02:50,292 --> 01:02:52,500
The baby powder for sweat.

905
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,750
And where's your underwear
for after the shower?

906
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:57,500
- In here.
- Cover up, cover up.

907
01:02:57,833 --> 01:02:58,833
Cover up.

908
01:03:01,792 --> 01:03:03,542
We're only missing Collantes.

909
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:07,167
I hope Julio told him how to get here.

910
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,125
Last year we trained together.

911
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:11,167
The ball-biting fly, we said.

912
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:12,958
Julio told me he was tall.

913
01:03:13,042 --> 01:03:15,792
- Not at all, she's rather small.
- What do you mean, "she"?

914
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,042
Collantes!

915
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:25,333
Collantes! Collantes!
Collantes! Collantes!

916
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,333
What a shithole for a meeting point,
when I live in the fucking sticks.

917
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:43,500
- Good morning, Collantes.
- Who the fuck are you?

918
01:03:44,292 --> 01:03:46,625
I'm Marco, your coach.
Welcome to the team.

919
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:49,500
Don't be fresh, I'm "miss" for you.

920
01:03:49,583 --> 01:03:50,917
I beg your pardon.

921
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:54,000
- What's that?
- My board. What about it?

922
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:56,333
Well, we're playing basketball,
not surfing.

923
01:03:56,542 --> 01:04:00,625
I like to have it with me in case
there's a pool in the hotel.

924
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:04,458
I bring sick bags.
Sometimes I get carsick.

925
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:10,167
What hotel? It's just a day trip.

926
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,292
Fuck, man, what a negative dude.

927
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:14,417
- Where did you get him?
- He came along.

928
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,208
Hey. Bus.

929
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:20,792
One question, what day is it?

930
01:04:21,417 --> 01:04:25,458
<i>Today's Saturday!
Such a beautiful Saturday!</i>

931
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
<i>I like Saturdays!
Saturdays are so nice!</i>

932
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:34,417
<i>I like Saturdays!
Beautiful Saturdays!</i>

933
01:04:37,042 --> 01:04:40,125
- Come on, attack, Pedro!
- Pedro!

934
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:44,917
Come on! Watch that man!

935
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:46,583
Help him in defence!

936
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:49,625
Great, Pedro! Very good.

937
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:51,375
Well done, Pedro!

938
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:52,875
Pedro...

939
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:08,417
- Where's Collantes?
- Not here.

940
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:13,500
Come on, Pedro!

941
01:05:16,167 --> 01:05:17,875
Listen, man-to-man guard!

942
01:05:18,917 --> 01:05:20,667
Support in defence, guys!

943
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:26,500
Pedro! Pedro! Pedro!

944
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:32,000
Hey...

945
01:05:32,917 --> 01:05:35,083
What's up with their number seven?

946
01:05:35,917 --> 01:05:38,083
What's up with him?
There's nothing wrong with him.

947
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,250
Nothing!

948
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:40,667
He's scoring big time.

949
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:44,042
I mean, he isn't...

950
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:48,792
Come on.

951
01:05:50,792 --> 01:05:53,458
Collantes, where the fuck were you?

952
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:57,542
Smoking. Can't do it in here.

953
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:58,833
It's not allowed.

954
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:00,625
Get the ball, guys!

955
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,417
Mark that guy, please!

956
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:09,292
- I can stun him.
- Well go and do it.

957
01:06:09,375 --> 01:06:10,958
- Totally or just a bit?
- Totally.

958
01:06:11,042 --> 01:06:12,167
I'll be right back.

959
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:15,375
Pass it to Pedro, boys.

960
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:16,708
Fabién.

961
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:27,833
Now I see why you call her the fly.

962
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:30,625
No!

963
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,292
The ball-biting fly. Ball-biting fly!

964
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:35,833
Stunned!

965
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:39,667
<i>We won!
It's so beautiful to win!</i>

966
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:44,208
<i>It's beautiful to win on Saturdays!
We won!</i>

967
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:48,542
<i>I like to win!</i>

968
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:50,708
<i>We won!
I like to win!</i>

969
01:06:50,792 --> 01:06:53,125
I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU. WE NEED TO TALK.

970
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:54,667
I'M SORRY.

971
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:58,958
Collantes.

972
01:06:59,042 --> 01:07:01,708
I have a boyfriend.
Don't get your hopes up.

973
01:07:02,167 --> 01:07:03,208
Lucky you.

974
01:07:03,417 --> 01:07:05,708
- Don't you have a girlfriend?
- No, I don't.

975
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:08,125
- That figures.
- Am I that ugly?

976
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:11,000
- You're not exactly Brad Pitt.
- Yeah.

977
01:07:11,292 --> 01:07:14,625
Well I'm married
to a very beautiful girl called Sonia.

978
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:18,000
So, why didn't she come?
Hard to believe.

979
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:21,375
They had an argument.

980
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:24,083
- Welcome to the debate, Manuel.
- Thank you.

981
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:29,667
- What was the fuss about?
- There was no fuss, we just...

982
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:32,958
Had an argument.
It's kind of usual with these people.

983
01:07:33,042 --> 01:07:35,708
One more joining in.
What do you know, Fabién?

984
01:07:35,792 --> 01:07:38,542
I know. Otherwise,
you'd be happy that we won.

985
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:40,917
It's because his parents didn't show up.

986
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,708
- Bye, Sergio.
- See you.

987
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:47,125
It's because they're dead, right?

988
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:48,750
No, my parents are not dead.

989
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:50,500
And why does she brush you off?

990
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:52,458
She doesn't. And I don't either.

991
01:07:52,542 --> 01:07:55,667
- So?
- So what? It's not that easy.

992
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:58,208
Well, do something. Bring her cookies.

993
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,375
Cookies, you say?

994
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:03,333
Better than a silly bouquet.

995
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:04,542
Besides, flowers...

996
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:07,625
You gotta be careful with flowers.
They're the devil's kin.

997
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:10,125
<i>So beautiful to win!
We won!</i>

998
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:11,375
Don't.

999
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:12,542
For fuck's sake.

1000
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:16,083
Want some?

1001
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:18,292
Don't even answer. Let's go.

1002
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:19,625
Please.

1003
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:23,333
<i>I like powder!</i>

1004
01:08:23,417 --> 01:08:25,292
<i>Delicious powder.</i>

1005
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:28,458
<i>I like powder!
Delicious powder.</i>

1006
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:32,083
<i>Powder is delicious!</i>

1007
01:08:32,167 --> 01:08:34,792
<i>Delicious powder!</i>

1008
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:37,500
<i>Delicious powder!</i>

1009
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,250
What?

1010
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,208
Isn't your ward around or something?

1011
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:54,500
- The person in charge.
- In charge.

1012
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:59,542
- Please, get back to your seat.
- No.

1013
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:01,417
Please, get back to your seat!

1014
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,875
N-O! No.

1015
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:06,667
He looks like a Minion, mom.

1016
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:13,708
Paquflo!

1017
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,583
Oh, jeez!

1018
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:20,417
Holy Mother!

1019
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:29,958
Shit!

1020
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:33,708
You all right, guys?

1021
01:09:33,792 --> 01:09:35,125
Fucking awesome!

1022
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:37,833
<i>I like Saturdays!</i>

1023
01:09:39,625 --> 01:09:41,292
He)' YOU, the pop singer!

1024
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:43,625
You shut the fuck up or get off the bus!

1025
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:46,750
Hey you. Don't you talk
like that to this man.

1026
01:09:46,833 --> 01:09:50,042
He's singing because he's happy.
And I can't see a "no singing" sign.

1027
01:09:50,292 --> 01:09:53,292
-It's outrageous.
- They should have a special van.

1028
01:09:54,083 --> 01:09:57,208
They're not normal, for God's sake.

1029
01:09:57,292 --> 01:10:01,250
We are normal.
We just have different skills.

1030
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:03,958
You shut up. Let's not have a row.

1031
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:08,167
Let's cool down a bit, okay?

1032
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,417
You people, excuse us.
The boys just won a game.

1033
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,833
They're a bit jumpy.
They don't mean to bother you.

1034
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,708
They're busting
everybody's balls, wise guy.

1035
01:10:15,792 --> 01:10:18,292
And they carry drugs.
They offered my son some.

1036
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:19,750
I'm clean, coach.

1037
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:25,167
Well, stay seated and quiet
or get off the bus, get it?

1038
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,542
Excuse me, sir. I have a question.

1039
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:31,042
Are you married or you still
haven't cheated on anyone yet?

1040
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:35,292
Look sweetie, I don't slap you
because you're a mongoloid.

1041
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:38,208
Don't be so fresh with me!

1042
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,000
- What about the next games?
- Fuck the games!

1043
01:10:48,083 --> 01:10:50,750
- And the championship?
- Fuck the championship, too.

1044
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:52,917
Fuck. It.

1045
01:11:19,292 --> 01:11:20,375
Sonia?

1046
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:46,500
Not to our song.

1047
01:11:49,042 --> 01:11:50,417
Not to our song!

1048
01:12:03,125 --> 01:12:04,750
Sorry, honey, I'm sorry!

1049
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:06,667
I didn't see you. Sorry.

1050
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:09,042
Sorry? You just busted my nose, Sonia!

1051
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:11,875
You scared me. I didn't see you.
I'm awfully sorry.

1052
01:12:11,958 --> 01:12:15,708
I'm coming to make up with you
and I get whacked.

1053
01:12:15,792 --> 01:12:17,458
- What happened to your nose?
- What?

1054
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:18,958
Have you been drinking?

1055
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:22,792
- You just whacked me.
- Nah, you already had that.

1056
01:12:23,167 --> 01:12:25,625
- You just said you didn't see me.
- Well, maybe

1057
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,667
just a glance before punching.

1058
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:30,208
So you admit you punched
me on purpose.

1059
01:12:30,292 --> 01:12:34,083
And you got another coming.
I'm not texting back? The nerve!

1060
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:36,917
I don't always do the right thing, yes,
but you're overreacting.

1061
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,750
No, you don't.
But that's as usual.

1062
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:40,583
Thanks a bunch.

1063
01:12:43,042 --> 01:12:44,375
How's the team doing?

1064
01:12:44,792 --> 01:12:47,667
Brilliant. We just won a game.
Just brilliant.

1065
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:50,542
Great. When do you play next?

1066
01:12:50,625 --> 01:12:52,083
- There's no next.
- How come?

1067
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:56,875
I can't handle a bunch of 30-year-olds
acting like babies.

1068
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:59,750
- You're afraid of handling them.
- Afraid? That's nonsense.

1069
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:02,667
I've been convicted to train them,
not to take them around.

1070
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,417
One day it'll end in disaster.

1071
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,167
You're their coach,
you have to protect and guard them.

1072
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,042
Their coach, not their father.

1073
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:10,833
True. You're nobody's father.

1074
01:13:10,917 --> 01:13:13,125
- You had no father so nobody should.
- What?

1075
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:21,875
I'm leaving.
I don't really know why I came.

1076
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:24,083
Yes, you're going to play, Marco.

1077
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:28,500
You tell me how, because I'm not taking
a bus or a train with them.

1078
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:30,417
- No way.
- You can rent a van.

1079
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,500
We can't afford it.

1080
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:32,708
I know where to get one.

1081
01:13:32,792 --> 01:13:34,500
I can't drive and they don't.

1082
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:36,833
- Any other excuse?
-lt's not an excuse.

1083
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:40,792
You drive, since you're so clever
and you care so much for my team.

1084
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:41,750
Shit.

1085
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:46,125
Start the engine.
Just listen to the sound.

1086
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:49,000
The engine is a-okay.

1087
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:52,375
Now, the clutch.
Foot all the way down.

1088
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:56,000
And you find the gear smooth, real smooth.

1089
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:59,625
Now it's engaged.
Careful, don't make the gear grind.

1090
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:03,542
Once the cog engages,
you let go of the...

1091
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:04,958
Come now, please!

1092
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:07,333
A little quiet if you please!

1093
01:14:07,917 --> 01:14:08,833
One more time?

1094
01:14:08,917 --> 01:14:09,750
- No.
- No.

1095
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:11,583
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1096
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:13,458
Antonio, trust me.

1097
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,375
<i>I like to travel!</i>

1098
01:14:21,792 --> 01:14:25,667
Boy, are they lucky!
They're going to have a ball in there.

1099
01:14:26,875 --> 01:14:30,083
<i>I like to travel in a camper!</i>

1100
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:34,708
<i>I like camper vans!
Such a beautiful van!</i>

1101
01:14:36,833 --> 01:14:38,792
You tried with the clutch yet?

1102
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:42,208
Collantes, women must stand by each other.

1103
01:14:42,292 --> 01:14:43,667
Don't be fresh with me.

1104
01:14:44,708 --> 01:14:48,000
You, why don't you drive?
She doesn't know shit about it.

1105
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:49,917
I haven't got a licence.

1106
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:51,375
Why don't you get one?

1107
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:54,000
I did. But a lady took it away from me.

1108
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:55,125
Nasty bitch!

1109
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:58,083
You want Paquito to tell his aunt?
She's a judge.

1110
01:14:58,167 --> 01:15:00,167
She can put that lady in jail.

1111
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,167
- Okay.
- No.

1112
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:04,042
Let it be. Don't tell her anything.

1113
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:11,875
I brought a snack so I don't get hungry.

1114
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:40,708
- It went in.
- I say.

1115
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:53,833
Don't you dare to take my boy out!

1116
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,833
What are you doing? Eyes on the road.

1117
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Time-out.

1118
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:45,083
Great, guys, well done!

1119
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:48,042
These guys are terrific in attack.
So we're doing this.

1120
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:50,458
Stay strong in defence, bold contact...

1121
01:16:50,542 --> 01:16:53,625
No way. We must attack.
The boys are playing great.

1122
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:54,667
Great.

1123
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:56,333
Sonia, please, I'm the coach.

1124
01:16:56,542 --> 01:16:58,000
- He has no idea.
- No idea.

1125
01:16:58,083 --> 01:16:59,833
- Move the ball and attack.
- Attack.

1126
01:17:00,292 --> 01:17:02,708
- Shall I send you both to the camper?
- Yes!

1127
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:10,208
That's it!

1128
01:17:40,167 --> 01:17:42,375
UNSTOPPABLE FRIENDS

1129
01:17:42,458 --> 01:17:44,667
Come on, forward, shoot!

1130
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:48,500
What happened?

1131
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,875
<i>You pick a card. Any one you like.</i>

1132
01:17:54,292 --> 01:17:56,333
- The knight of pentacles.
- Knight of pentacles.

1133
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:02,167
How about that?

1134
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:18,542
Well done.

1135
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:22,083
Juanma, if you keep it up
you're going to grow gills.

1136
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:25,750
<i>I like showers!
Delicious showers!</i>

1137
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:44,000
You know, Carrascosa
should see you now.

1138
01:18:45,417 --> 01:18:47,167
<i>Let's see the mechanics for shooting.</i>

1139
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:51,125
Arm at right angle. And the wrist too.

1140
01:18:51,208 --> 01:18:53,750
Holding the ball on the fingertips.

1141
01:18:54,417 --> 01:18:55,708
Do you love me?

1142
01:18:56,417 --> 01:18:57,958
- Do I love you?
- Yes.

1143
01:18:59,042 --> 01:18:59,958
A whole fucking lot.

1144
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:05,250
FRIENDS BASKETBALL TEAM

1145
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:37,000
Round up, boys.

1146
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:40,667
These guys are really bad.

1147
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:44,000
So we'll just play like we use to,
and we're going to crush them.

1148
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:46,042
- All right, everybody?
- I don't agree.

1149
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:47,000
No.

1150
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:51,208
- With what?
- With crushing them.

1151
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:54,667
- We play to win, not to humiliate.
- No.

1152
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,208
Collantes!

1153
01:20:11,833 --> 01:20:14,542
With this win you climb to third place
in the standings.

1154
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:17,750
What does it mean for you
to play the National Series?

1155
01:20:18,042 --> 01:20:19,125
Very good.

1156
01:20:34,167 --> 01:20:37,000
You still with that?
Start scrubbing, dumbass.

1157
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:48,042
That's it, great!

1158
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:54,292
If we win this, we're in the big final.
How about that?

1159
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:55,500
I'd never have figured.

1160
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:57,458
Strong defence!

1161
01:20:57,542 --> 01:20:59,625
Strong defence, guys!

1162
01:21:00,625 --> 01:21:01,667
Come on, Fabién!

1163
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:06,750
That's it. Come on, go!

1164
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:09,458
Good passes! Pass to Juanma!

1165
01:21:10,042 --> 01:21:11,833
Well done!

1166
01:21:12,292 --> 01:21:14,583
Come on, you can shoot, Fabién. Shoot!

1167
01:21:14,667 --> 01:21:17,917
That's it, very good. Great game, guys.

1168
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,167
Very well played.

1169
01:21:22,917 --> 01:21:25,458
Arms up! Come on!

1170
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,708
- Romén.
- Hi, coach.

1171
01:21:29,792 --> 01:21:30,958
Hi, Romén.

1172
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:33,750
How are you?
It's been ages since I heard from you.

1173
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:35,292
I like him. He's doing great.

1174
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:38,292
He's very good.

1175
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:43,750
- Montes is very good.
- He's learning.

1176
01:21:45,917 --> 01:21:48,917
I mean, he'll always carry his disability.

1177
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:51,583
But we're teaching him how to handle it.

1178
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:55,833
Run back to defend!

1179
01:22:07,667 --> 01:22:09,000
Well done!

1180
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:28,333
Romén!

1181
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:32,667
We play the title game, next.

1182
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:35,292
I say "we" because I'd like you
to play with us, Romén.

1183
01:22:35,792 --> 01:22:37,917
- You don't want to look stupid?
- No.

1184
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:41,417
I was stupid the last time we spoke.
I'm sorry.

1185
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:46,583
Know what? I think you're short.
But not for basketball.

1186
01:22:49,792 --> 01:22:51,958
Is that a yes or a no?

1187
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:03,167
- They're nuts.
- They're happy.

1188
01:23:04,042 --> 01:23:06,667
- They feel like a real team.
- They are.

1189
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:10,000
They owe it a great deal to you, Sonia.

1190
01:23:10,542 --> 01:23:11,625
You bet.

1191
01:23:15,667 --> 01:23:19,625
- What about you and me?
- What about us?

1192
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:22,542
We could be a team, again.

1193
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:26,000
- You and me?
- Yes.

1194
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:29,792
- Would you?
- Of course, Marco.

1195
01:23:30,542 --> 01:23:33,625
But besides you and me,
I'd like to have one more team member.

1196
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:37,083
I know.

1197
01:23:38,458 --> 01:23:41,167
I want to be a mother.
I'm not waiting any longer.

1198
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:45,917
I mean...

1199
01:23:46,167 --> 01:23:47,458
Will you make excuses forever?

1200
01:23:49,208 --> 01:23:50,500
It's not easy.

1201
01:23:50,583 --> 01:23:52,333
We have to think it through.

1202
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:57,417
When you're over forty
and a first-time mother...

1203
01:24:00,292 --> 01:24:02,250
-...it increases the chances of...
- Of what?

1204
01:24:02,333 --> 01:24:03,333
Well...

1205
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:05,958
- Of Down syndrome.
- Down syndrome,

1206
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:09,750
or autism, or like any of these kids.

1207
01:24:11,958 --> 01:24:12,833
Sonia.

1208
01:24:14,542 --> 01:24:15,958
- Sonia.
- Coach.

1209
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,917
What's up, Marin.

1210
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:20,708
Well,

1211
01:24:20,792 --> 01:24:24,125
I wouldn't like to have
a child like us, either.

1212
01:24:24,542 --> 01:24:26,083
No, I'm sorry. I didn't...

1213
01:24:26,167 --> 01:24:29,167
If I could choose,
I'd want a healthy child, I'm not stupid.

1214
01:24:29,542 --> 01:24:34,042
But I would like to have
a father like you.

1215
01:24:34,292 --> 01:24:36,417
Thank you very much for everything.

1216
01:24:43,875 --> 01:24:45,417
Impossible, Marco.

1217
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,250
It's the final.
How come we can't play the final?

1218
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,708
- The Dwarfs play the final.
- So?

1219
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:53,625
We won't laugh at them,
we'll treat them with respect.

1220
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:57,042
The Dwarfs play at home,
in Tenerife, in the Canary Islands.

1221
01:24:58,250 --> 01:24:59,958
But that's wonderful.

1222
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,750
Something the boys will never forget.

1223
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:04,708
The club has to buy the tickets.

1224
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:09,083
Planes, hotel. We can't afford it.

1225
01:25:09,167 --> 01:25:11,333
We're second and we can make the title.

1226
01:25:11,417 --> 01:25:13,250
There must be something we can do.

1227
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,750
Do you realise that most of them
have never seen the ocean?

1228
01:25:19,042 --> 01:25:22,792
Don't worry about them.
I told them and they perfectly understand.

1229
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:03,500
There, sweetie.

1230
01:26:17,958 --> 01:26:20,667
- You look happy, Jesús.
- No, I'm sad.

1231
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:24,375
- But you're smiling.
-l'm sad inside.

1232
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:32,917
First position. Open. Up.

1233
01:26:33,958 --> 01:26:37,208
First position, and down.

1234
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:39,750
First position. Open.

1235
01:27:08,917 --> 01:27:13,042
Son, I'm leaving. Don't be a fool
and take good care of the house.

1236
01:27:13,125 --> 01:27:15,542
- Where are you going?
- To my spiritual retreat.

1237
01:27:16,458 --> 01:27:17,500
When will you be back?

1238
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,667
I'll let you know in a few days.

1239
01:27:22,292 --> 01:27:25,333
- Mom.
- Yes.

1240
01:27:26,375 --> 01:27:27,500
Have a great time.

1241
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:48,667
- Antonio, how are you?
- Still sore about it.

1242
01:27:48,917 --> 01:27:50,958
Naturally. Say, is the boss around?

1243
01:27:51,042 --> 01:27:52,625
Back in there.

1244
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,250
May I borrow this for a second?

1245
01:27:56,542 --> 01:27:58,083
Sure! Take it all and keep it!

1246
01:28:00,667 --> 01:28:02,083
What do you want now, Marco?

1247
01:28:04,667 --> 01:28:05,833
An actress.

1248
01:28:25,292 --> 01:28:26,375
Sweetie pie.

1249
01:28:27,667 --> 01:28:30,667
Get your boss.
We have a couple of questions.

1250
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:33,542
We fully comply with the schedules, here.

1251
01:28:33,625 --> 01:28:34,583
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1252
01:28:34,667 --> 01:28:36,125
- Do you know what's in here?
- No.

1253
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:40,167
Videos and statements from workers
proving your ongoing ill-treatment

1254
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:42,458
of Benito Recuenco Valdegémez,

1255
01:28:42,542 --> 01:28:45,875
an intellectually disabled employee
thanks to whom you, Mr Yepes,

1256
01:28:45,958 --> 01:28:48,250
get a whopping tax benefit.

1257
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:50,583
- Wait a minute.
- Wait nothing.

1258
01:28:50,667 --> 01:28:53,875
We'll close this joint
and give you a 60,000 euro fine.

1259
01:28:53,958 --> 01:28:56,375
Plus 4 to 6 years in Alcalá's pen.

1260
01:28:56,917 --> 01:29:00,667
-Isn't there any way of...
- I beg your pardon?

1261
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:04,042
You're not proposing something,
are you Mr Yepes?

1262
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:05,708
Not at all.

1263
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:08,833
But I'm sure we can talk it out. Can't we?

1264
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:15,958
<i>I like to fly!
I like planes!</i>

1265
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:20,208
<i>Flying is so beautiful!
I like planes!</i>

1266
01:29:20,292 --> 01:29:24,417
<i>Flying is so beautiful!
I like planes!</i>

1267
01:29:33,792 --> 01:29:38,083
His boss paid for the tickets.
He's the new team sponsor.

1268
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:39,958
The world's full of good people.

1269
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:41,542
- God bless him.
- Yes.

1270
01:29:41,792 --> 01:29:44,000
And he gave me 15 days leave.

1271
01:29:44,292 --> 01:29:45,583
- Thank the Lord.
- Sure.

1272
01:29:45,667 --> 01:29:49,208
Sure. He really handed out, sister.

1273
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,042
You can see the ocean.
The whole ocean.

1274
01:29:55,125 --> 01:29:57,000
- Why?
- I don't know.

1275
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:00,125
But it's much bigger than I thought.

1276
01:30:08,833 --> 01:30:10,458
I'm glad you came along, Romén.

1277
01:30:11,917 --> 01:30:14,125
You know,
since your wife took over the team

1278
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:16,083
I really feel like playing again.

1279
01:30:18,833 --> 01:30:21,125
She told me she wants to have a baby.

1280
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:28,333
With my eyes.

1281
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:47,917
Nurse!

1282
01:30:48,167 --> 01:30:50,917
Please, tell the captain
to swerve left a little bit.

1283
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,792
We don't want to crash
with the 17:45 Ryanair

1284
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:56,792
Tenerife-Liverpool,

1285
01:30:57,292 --> 01:30:59,417
which is late.

1286
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:01,958
- Are you all right?
- He's okay.

1287
01:31:02,042 --> 01:31:05,042
He's just allergic to plane crashes.

1288
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:07,292
He has a reaction.

1289
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:33,833
All I need now is a credit card
for the deposit.

1290
01:31:34,375 --> 01:31:36,958
We're staying, right? Don't fuck me.

1291
01:31:37,667 --> 01:31:40,667
- I brought my skis.
-ls there a tennis table?

1292
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:42,333
We have a fully equipped gym.

1293
01:31:42,417 --> 01:31:43,625
- With a rope?
- Everything.

1294
01:31:43,833 --> 01:31:46,750
These are the keys.
We've got double rooms

1295
01:31:46,833 --> 01:31:49,375
-so we'll have to share.
-l'm with Sonia.

1296
01:31:49,458 --> 01:31:50,875
- No way.
-l'm sorry.

1297
01:31:50,958 --> 01:31:53,083
He means well.
Don't you see how hot she is?

1298
01:31:53,167 --> 01:31:54,583
- Sorry.
- You bunk with Jesús.

1299
01:31:54,667 --> 01:31:56,458
I won't sleep with him.
I don't trust him.

1300
01:31:56,542 --> 01:31:58,083
You have two beds. It's okay.

1301
01:31:58,167 --> 01:32:01,708
Then I'll have the upper bed,
in case I piss, I'd rather have it.

1302
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,375
- I share with Collantes.
- Yes!

1303
01:32:06,792 --> 01:32:08,625
- All right, follow me.
- Come on, guys.

1304
01:32:08,708 --> 01:32:11,667
I'm going to see the ocean.
See you later.

1305
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:17,667
Split in two groups and come on up.

1306
01:32:20,292 --> 01:32:22,500
Wait a minute,
there's no room for all of you.

1307
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:24,625
Split in groups, please.

1308
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:26,583
Two groups
when there wasn't room for one?

1309
01:32:26,667 --> 01:32:28,542
First one group, then the other.

1310
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:30,625
You first, coach.

1311
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:34,083
No, I'll take the stairs.

1312
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:36,000
Sonia, you take care.

1313
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:39,750
- Up to the 7th floor?
<i>-I'll</i> do a little exercise.

1314
01:32:40,042 --> 01:32:44,167
- You need your tracksuit.
- He doesn't wear one. No.

1315
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:45,250
Look, guys.

1316
01:32:48,417 --> 01:32:51,333
Elevators scare me to death. I admit it.

1317
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:55,333
I got trapped in one when I was a kid.
I can't even go near one.

1318
01:32:55,417 --> 01:32:58,542
That's like my water thing.
And now, see for yourself.

1319
01:32:59,542 --> 01:33:00,833
Okay, I'll be upstairs.

1320
01:33:05,292 --> 01:33:06,417
A snake!

1321
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:09,333
- A snake, coach!
- A snake?

1322
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:11,125
A snake. Come here.

1323
01:33:13,083 --> 01:33:14,750
- A snake!
- What are you doing?

1324
01:33:15,333 --> 01:33:16,708
- Marco.
- No,no!

1325
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:18,917
No, let him out!

1326
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,042
- Sonia!
- Marco! Let him out.

1327
01:33:22,125 --> 01:33:24,875
I didn't go because I'm claustrophobic.

1328
01:33:24,958 --> 01:33:27,208
- Marco!
- Not because I'm a coward.

1329
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:30,375
Don't you see the lift can't make it?

1330
01:33:30,458 --> 01:33:32,375
Sure it will.
Look, it's special for groups.

1331
01:33:33,333 --> 01:33:34,500
But groups of four!

1332
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:39,500
Shit. I knew it. See?
Someone ring the bell.

1333
01:33:39,583 --> 01:33:42,875
- Where do you see a bell?
- Over there. There's a switch.

1334
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:44,375
Somebody ring, please.

1335
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:48,375
I'll get help.

1336
01:33:54,583 --> 01:33:57,667
I'm calling my boyfriend.
To say goodbye.

1337
01:33:57,750 --> 01:34:00,250
Should we jump to get it started?

1338
01:34:00,333 --> 01:34:03,792
You read my mind, dude.
It happened once at my place.

1339
01:34:03,875 --> 01:34:06,625
Listen to me.
We must do it all at once.

1340
01:34:06,917 --> 01:34:07,917
Come on!

1341
01:34:12,042 --> 01:34:13,292
Stop!

1342
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:18,333
What was that?

1343
01:34:34,375 --> 01:34:37,625
Please! Please!

1344
01:34:39,875 --> 01:34:42,250
Are you okay? Talk to me.

1345
01:34:47,375 --> 01:34:50,375
- How did it go, coach?
- Don't...

1346
01:35:09,875 --> 01:35:11,583
No, really great, Mom.

1347
01:35:12,333 --> 01:35:14,667
We just had a little scare
but nothing much.

1348
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,208
Nothing, really.

1349
01:35:18,458 --> 01:35:21,917
Listen... thanks for calling.

1350
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:24,750
The guys?

1351
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:28,333
Already gone to bed.
Tomorrow they must be in shape.

1352
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:32,000
Hold on a sec.

1353
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:48,542
Mom?

1354
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:52,167
Yes, still here. The thing is...

1355
01:35:53,042 --> 01:35:56,167
Never mind.
What about your spiritual retreat?

1356
01:35:56,708 --> 01:35:59,042
Well, quite beneficial, son.

1357
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:03,792
I spend the whole day,
except when I'm calling you,

1358
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,042
praying and begging for you two.

1359
01:36:06,333 --> 01:36:09,625
- Are you in a kind of convent?
- Yes, well.

1360
01:36:09,917 --> 01:36:12,250
It's a rather secluded place.

1361
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:15,542
Good evening, Mr Marco.

1362
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:34,667
- Manuel.
- What?

1363
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:36,542
- May I ask you something?
- Yes.

1364
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,583
Why do you do this?

1365
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,125
It makes time go faster.

1366
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:47,375
So when you do this,
time goes faster?

1367
01:36:48,083 --> 01:36:50,917
Yes, but you have to wait some years.

1368
01:36:56,417 --> 01:36:57,458
He's an Olympic champion.

1369
01:36:59,958 --> 01:37:03,542
- What do you mean?
- Gold medal in Sydney, 2000.

1370
01:37:04,167 --> 01:37:07,708
- In the Olympics?
- In ours. The Paralympics.

1371
01:37:08,542 --> 01:37:10,917
He was captain of the Spanish team.

1372
01:37:11,583 --> 01:37:13,458
- Really?
- Yes.

1373
01:37:14,125 --> 01:37:17,417
They took away his medal.
He almost killed himself.

1374
01:37:18,042 --> 01:37:19,875
- Why?
- It was a hard blow for him.

1375
01:37:19,958 --> 01:37:21,833
I mean, why did he lose his medal?

1376
01:37:21,917 --> 01:37:25,417
Because he and another chap
were the only really disabled people.

1377
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:28,125
The others had no disability whatsoever.

1378
01:37:28,208 --> 01:37:30,583
There was an engineer,
an architect, a journalist.

1379
01:37:30,667 --> 01:37:34,542
Which isn't saying much.
I've seen journalists play like shit.

1380
01:37:34,625 --> 01:37:36,417
How come they did that? It's a fraud.

1381
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:40,708
The Federation sent them to win
in order to get larger subsidies.

1382
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:43,125
A shameful thing.

1383
01:37:43,542 --> 01:37:44,625
Did nobody realise?

1384
01:37:44,708 --> 01:37:49,125
Yes, the press aired it,
and they all had to give the medals back.

1385
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:53,500
Even Romén.
That's why he doesn't trust coaches.

1386
01:39:01,417 --> 01:39:06,083
Dwarfs! Dwarfs! Dwarfs!

1387
01:39:09,583 --> 01:39:13,250
They're not that small.
They look big enough.

1388
01:39:29,958 --> 01:39:33,125
This isn't a friendly game, is it?

1389
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:37,917
Friendly? No.
This is the National Series final, Marin.

1390
01:39:38,292 --> 01:39:40,583
And we'll win because we are champs.

1391
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:45,375
But put on your headguard anyway.

1392
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,917
- Am I in, coach?
- No. Later, for Sergio.

1393
01:40:09,417 --> 01:40:11,542
- Should I start warming up?
- No.

1394
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:16,125
Run, Benito!

1395
01:40:18,417 --> 01:40:19,500
Come on!

1396
01:40:21,125 --> 01:40:22,250
Romén!

1397
01:40:26,792 --> 01:40:29,875
Come on, guys, get back. Get back, quick.

1398
01:40:33,292 --> 01:40:34,500
Block!

1399
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:41,542
Come on, Sergio.

1400
01:40:43,042 --> 01:40:43,875
Hey!

1401
01:40:47,667 --> 01:40:49,042
Sorry, man.

1402
01:40:50,917 --> 01:40:52,292
Now it's your turn.

1403
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:54,958
- Without warming up?
- Right. Move!

1404
01:40:58,958 --> 01:41:00,250
That's it, Manuel!

1405
01:41:02,417 --> 01:41:03,875
Pass it to me!

1406
01:41:07,458 --> 01:41:08,708
Shoofl

1407
01:41:13,292 --> 01:41:15,458
We have to select the shots!

1408
01:41:17,625 --> 01:41:19,625
Zone defence!

1409
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:23,083
Defence!

1410
01:41:23,167 --> 01:41:24,125
Come on!

1411
01:41:44,292 --> 01:41:45,458
You have to defend, guys!

1412
01:41:55,083 --> 01:41:56,083
Go!

1413
01:42:20,708 --> 01:42:21,917
Attack!

1414
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,125
Great, go on, guys!

1415
01:42:25,833 --> 01:42:28,375
Great, now defence, guys! Defence!

1416
01:42:28,792 --> 01:42:30,083
That's it, Manuel!

1417
01:42:30,583 --> 01:42:31,458
Come on!

1418
01:42:35,958 --> 01:42:38,125
Great, go on, guys!

1419
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:44,083
Come on, boys! Go, go!

1420
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:48,333
Yes!

1421
01:42:59,792 --> 01:43:01,458
Get the rebound!

1422
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:16,292
Defence!

1423
01:43:18,833 --> 01:43:20,458
Get that rebound!

1424
01:43:22,583 --> 01:43:23,542
Go, Romén!

1425
01:43:25,792 --> 01:43:27,500
Look at Manuel!

1426
01:43:28,375 --> 01:43:29,792
Good!

1427
01:43:31,667 --> 01:43:33,417
That's it, well done!

1428
01:43:56,250 --> 01:43:57,833
To Romén, to Romén.

1429
01:43:59,208 --> 01:44:00,750
To Romén!

1430
01:44:01,458 --> 01:44:02,708
Come on!

1431
01:44:26,042 --> 01:44:29,792
- Go, Sergio!
- Bravo! What a shot!

1432
01:44:55,333 --> 01:44:57,500
Go, go, go!

1433
01:45:01,667 --> 01:45:04,750
We play like a team! That's it.

1434
01:45:21,417 --> 01:45:24,042
- How much longer?
- One minute, Manuel.

1435
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:26,500
Guys, steal and attack!

1436
01:45:29,917 --> 01:45:33,542
Marin, don't let him through! Don't!

1437
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,583
Referee!

1438
01:45:41,375 --> 01:45:44,083
Coach, I've got a 90 degree
sprained finger.

1439
01:45:44,167 --> 01:45:45,042
Don't hype it, Marin.

1440
01:45:47,792 --> 01:45:49,750
Off to the sickbay. You can't play.

1441
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:50,833
But I want to play.

1442
01:45:50,917 --> 01:45:54,167
One minute left and one point under,
the team needs me.

1443
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:57,208
Not like that. You can't. Off you go.

1444
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:05,625
Much better.

1445
01:46:05,708 --> 01:46:09,000
Anyway I think I'll go
and have it examined.

1446
01:46:09,083 --> 01:46:13,083
I don't want to lose the hand
and have some complication with the arm.

1447
01:46:13,167 --> 01:46:14,292
Go.

1448
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:42,833
Defence!

1449
01:46:43,125 --> 01:46:45,667
Hold on to the ball! It's on the line!

1450
01:46:48,042 --> 01:46:49,708
Everybody on defence!

1451
01:46:58,917 --> 01:47:00,125
Attack!

1452
01:47:01,042 --> 01:47:02,125
Ten seconds.

1453
01:47:07,167 --> 01:47:09,458
Benito, shoot for the draw!

1454
01:47:09,542 --> 01:47:13,542
Shoot, Benito! Shoot, shoot!

1455
01:47:15,958 --> 01:47:17,250
Over here!

1456
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:23,542
Over here!

1457
01:48:15,583 --> 01:48:17,000
Congratulations!

1458
01:48:37,208 --> 01:48:41,667
Second! We came in second!

1459
01:48:43,292 --> 01:48:47,667
Friends! Friends! Friends!

1460
01:49:02,917 --> 01:49:06,542
- We're great, coach.
- But we lost.

1461
01:49:06,792 --> 01:49:09,333
Not at all! We're second-best!

1462
01:49:09,417 --> 01:49:10,292
Just so.

1463
01:49:10,375 --> 01:49:12,792
- Runner-ups are better than champions.
- Oh, yes? How?

1464
01:49:12,875 --> 01:49:16,625
Sure! What's better,
a lonely runner or a runner-up?

1465
01:49:17,667 --> 01:49:19,083
I love you, coach!

1466
01:49:27,458 --> 01:49:31,083
Champions! Champions! Champions!

1467
01:49:42,667 --> 01:49:43,625
Mom.

1468
01:49:49,875 --> 01:49:53,958
- What a game, son.
- Thanks, but I'm sorry lost.

1469
01:49:54,583 --> 01:49:57,458
Is that so?
Well, no mother cares about that.

1470
01:49:57,875 --> 01:50:00,500
The thing is if you're all right.

1471
01:50:01,417 --> 01:50:04,292
I'm all right, Mom. I feel great.

1472
01:50:05,292 --> 01:50:07,375
It's been ages since I felt this great.

1473
01:50:23,208 --> 01:50:27,583
You were great.
And you did it for your team.

1474
01:50:28,917 --> 01:50:30,250
You're my team, Sonia.

1475
01:50:31,542 --> 01:50:33,417
And I'd love to make it grow.

1476
01:50:34,333 --> 01:50:37,625
And he could be another player. Or she.

1477
01:50:38,208 --> 01:50:39,125
With your eyes?

1478
01:50:39,542 --> 01:50:41,167
No, with Roman's if you please!

1479
01:50:52,458 --> 01:50:53,708
Sergio!

1480
01:51:16,042 --> 01:51:17,292
Are you stupid, Sergio?

1481
01:51:31,458 --> 01:51:33,583
- Come into the water.
- All right.

1482
01:51:43,667 --> 01:51:46,667
The Great Wall of China, Benito. Nice.

1483
01:51:55,458 --> 01:51:57,833
- How are you doing, Romén?
- Good.

1484
01:51:59,542 --> 01:52:00,583
I see that.

1485
01:52:05,042 --> 01:52:09,083
- You played like a champ.
- You did well too, coach.

1486
01:52:09,167 --> 01:52:12,083
- Thanks a lot, man.
- You trusted us.

1487
01:52:13,375 --> 01:52:15,542
You're champions. I had to.

1488
01:52:15,625 --> 01:52:16,875
Just runners-up.

1489
01:52:17,167 --> 01:52:19,750
Not you. You're already a champ.

1490
01:52:20,458 --> 01:52:23,250
Nobody can take it away from you. Ever.

1491
01:52:23,625 --> 01:52:25,958
We'll have to win the next championship.

1492
01:52:26,333 --> 01:52:28,417
- We will.
- I like that.

1493
01:52:29,833 --> 01:52:30,833
What?

1494
01:52:30,917 --> 01:52:33,625
To hear you say
"we will" instead of "you will".

1495
01:52:37,375 --> 01:52:38,708
Are you ever going to leave us?

1496
01:52:39,083 --> 01:52:41,833
You don't need me, Romén.
You know better than I do.

1497
01:52:41,917 --> 01:52:44,375
I got a head-start.
I played years in Getafe.

1498
01:52:44,458 --> 01:52:48,500
Getafe? I didn't know
they had a team of...

1499
01:52:48,583 --> 01:52:51,167
In the first team.
Carrascosa was coach.

1500
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:54,750
We were playing the promotion
when I had the accident.

1501
01:52:55,708 --> 01:52:57,125
- An accident?
- A motorbike crash.

1502
01:52:57,208 --> 01:52:59,167
A drunken driver hit me.

1503
01:52:59,542 --> 01:53:03,667
Nothing happened to him but I got
a head injury and went into a coma.

1504
01:53:05,042 --> 01:53:08,083
When I woke up with a mess
in my head, my girlfriend left me.

1505
01:53:08,542 --> 01:53:11,167
I had to quit college, too.
I wanted to be an architect.

1506
01:53:15,375 --> 01:53:16,458
I'm very sorry, Romén.

1507
01:53:16,792 --> 01:53:19,250
But I'm happy. Because we're together.

1508
01:53:19,333 --> 01:53:21,125
Together, we're going to win.

1509
01:53:28,792 --> 01:53:31,667
- My dad left us when I was 9.
- Sonia told me.

1510
01:53:34,333 --> 01:53:36,792
We'll never let you down, coach. Ever.

1511
01:54:02,292 --> 01:54:03,917
Who's calling at this hour?

1512
01:54:05,667 --> 01:54:07,000
It's too early.

1513
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:09,333
Answer.

1514
01:54:10,583 --> 01:54:13,542
- I bet it's Julio.
- It may be important.

1515
01:54:15,917 --> 01:54:17,167
Fat chance.

1516
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:27,500
Hello?

1517
01:54:31,625 --> 01:54:32,542
Paco!

1518
01:54:39,042 --> 01:54:39,958
How did you know?

1519
01:54:41,667 --> 01:54:44,417
Yes, that's right, runners-up.

1520
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,083
What?

1521
01:54:54,708 --> 01:54:55,708
What is it, Marco?

1522
01:54:56,292 --> 01:54:58,458
We both knew this moment had to come.

1523
01:54:59,208 --> 01:55:00,958
Well, this thing came up.

1524
01:55:01,042 --> 01:55:02,917
You signed your last day over a month ago.

1525
01:55:03,208 --> 01:55:05,792
You've given us much more than you had to.

1526
01:55:05,875 --> 01:55:08,208
You don't know how grateful the club is.

1527
01:55:08,875 --> 01:55:11,417
So? Going back home to Estudiantes?

1528
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:13,375
No. I'm making the National Team.

1529
01:55:13,458 --> 01:55:15,875
Holy shit!
Coach of the national team?

1530
01:55:15,958 --> 01:55:19,375
No, they hired Carrascosa, my old boss.

1531
01:55:19,458 --> 01:55:20,917
He asked me to be his second.

1532
01:55:22,125 --> 01:55:23,500
But it's a dream for me.

1533
01:55:24,833 --> 01:55:26,708
They want me to start right away, Julio.

1534
01:55:26,792 --> 01:55:28,708
I'm mighty glad for you.

1535
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:32,708
You'll always have
a bunch of good friends here.

1536
01:55:32,792 --> 01:55:33,875
You won them over.

1537
01:55:34,708 --> 01:55:36,875
I know it'll be hard to say goodbye.

1538
01:55:37,458 --> 01:55:38,667
But they'll understand.

1539
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:41,167
Look, I'd rather have you do it.

1540
01:55:41,250 --> 01:55:43,375
But you surely must say goodbye to them.

1541
01:55:43,458 --> 01:55:45,042
I'm sure they want to say goodbye to you.

1542
01:55:45,667 --> 01:55:49,333
Tell them I couldn't,
that I'll be back as soon as I can.

1543
01:56:21,958 --> 01:56:23,583
Are you leaving without saying goodbye?

1544
01:56:28,958 --> 01:56:31,417
- He doesn't speak.
- Quiet. Doesn't speak.

1545
01:56:35,375 --> 01:56:37,458
I've got to follow my own path, guys.

1546
01:56:38,458 --> 01:56:41,292
This is a great professional opportunity.
I have to make a living.

1547
01:56:41,375 --> 01:56:44,083
Sure you do, coach.
We just wanted to thank you.

1548
01:56:45,708 --> 01:56:48,875
You've been a very good man.

1549
01:56:48,958 --> 01:56:50,667
And you did teach us a lot.

1550
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:53,292
- I also learned.
- Yes.

1551
01:56:53,375 --> 01:56:55,125
You read our minds.

1552
01:56:55,417 --> 01:56:58,458
And you got over your fear of elevators.

1553
01:56:58,542 --> 01:56:59,708
And in one go.

1554
01:57:00,375 --> 01:57:03,500
And my girlfriend is proud of me
because she saw us on the Internet.

1555
01:57:03,583 --> 01:57:06,625
- And she's a whore.
- Maybe, but she's proud of me.

1556
01:57:06,708 --> 01:57:08,833
You made a team of us all.

1557
01:57:08,917 --> 01:57:12,542
You cared for us like a father.
A good one.

1558
01:57:12,958 --> 01:57:14,458
You cared for me too.

1559
01:57:15,375 --> 01:57:17,125
All the merit is yours.

1560
01:57:17,208 --> 01:57:20,667
We haven't had enough time
to set you completely right.

1561
01:57:20,750 --> 01:57:21,750
But we're happy enough.

1562
01:57:30,542 --> 01:57:33,167
- You're crying, coach.
- Crying.

1563
01:57:35,667 --> 01:57:37,250
No, I'm not, man.

1564
01:57:37,667 --> 01:57:40,500
It must be an allergy.
It happens to me sometimes.

1565
01:57:40,583 --> 01:57:44,167
It's not that. It's because
Manuel is holding him too tight.

1566
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:46,458
You squeezed him, man.
You almost crushed him.

1567
01:57:47,167 --> 01:57:49,083
You treated us like we were people.

1568
01:57:49,375 --> 01:57:51,792
- Well, you are.
- Don't be fresh with me.

1569
01:58:26,583 --> 01:58:29,833
We are the bread! We are the butter!

1570
01:58:29,917 --> 01:58:32,542
We are the toast in the silver platter!

1571
01:58:32,625 --> 01:58:35,750
Oranges and lemons! Champions!
