00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,918
Hey, Benji. It's me.
I'm just leaving my apartment.

4
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:24,293
Remember, we gotta be there, like,
three hours early.

5
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,001
Yeah, just ring me when you get this.

6
00:01:28,876 --> 00:01:30,585
Hey, Benji. I hope you left already...

7
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:32,543
'cause I'm stuck in a little traffic
on the BQE.

8
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,918
Just in case you can avoid it.

9
00:01:35,085 --> 00:01:36,751
Anyway, just ring me when you get this.

10
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,543
Hey, Benji.
Actually, traffic just cleared up.

11
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,793
So that's pretty good, if you were worried.

12
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,710
Maybe you weren't. Anyway,
just ring me when you get this, anyway.

13
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:48,418
Hey, Benji.
I'm sorry I'm leaving so many messages.

14
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:51,876
Just... Sorry. You can disregard them
'cause I'm... I'll be there soon, and I...

15
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:55,001
Yeah. I can't wait to see you, and I will not
leave you another message. Okay. Bye.

16
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:58,918
Hey, Benji. I just got to the airport.

17
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,876
I really hope you left already
or that you're, like...

18
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:02,168
I don't know, on your way.

19
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:04,585
Anyway, just ring me when you get this.

20
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:12,251
- Oh, God. You made it.
- What's up, cuz?

21
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:14,751
Oh, man, come here.
I called you so many times.

22
00:02:14,918 --> 00:02:16,835
- Step back, dude. Let me have a look at you.
- It's so good to see... Yeah.

23
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,293
- Okay.
- Turn around.

24
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,293
- I wanna see the whole fucking picture.
- What? Really?

25
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,793
- Twirl. Twirly dervish.
- Okay, okay.

26
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,543
- All right, all right.
- Yeah, man, look at you.

27
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,626
- Healthy, wealthy, and wise. You look good.
- Oh.

28
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:27,043
All right, listen,
I think we should check you in.

29
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,210
- I did a thing online. I...
- Oh, no. I did it.

30
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:30,210
- I checked in a while ago.
- Did you?

31
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:31,876
- Yeah.
- Sorry. When did you get here?

32
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:33,085
Few hours ago.

33
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:34,251
- Really?
- Yeah.

34
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:35,960
I mean, the flight's not for another, like,
two hours.

35
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:38,793
Yeah, but they open the airport super early.
You can just come here and hang out.

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,376
- Wow. Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

37
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:42,376
You meet the
craziest fucking people here, dude.

38
00:02:42,543 --> 00:02:44,001
Oh. And did you eat anything?

39
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:45,210
- I did. Yeah. No, yeah.
- Okay.

40
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,168
Just 'cause I'm gonna wanna get something...

41
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:47,210
- before we take off.
- Oh. Don't worry about it, man.

42
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,793
I got you a yogurt. It's a little warm.

43
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,293
- Warm?
- It's been in my pocket.

44
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,001
Shit, I don't have a spoon. That's okay.
You just sort of...

45
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:55,626
squeeze it, slurp it.

46
00:02:55,793 --> 00:02:57,043
Did you really get this for me?

47
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:58,793
Yeah, of course, dude.

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,793
- All right, you got your shit?
- Okay. Yeah.

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,626
- You know what else?
- What?

50
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:03,793
I also got some good shit for when we land.

51
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,460
Like, very, very good shit.

52
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:06,960
Wait. You're not, like,
taking weed into Poland, are you?

53
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:08,126
- Oh, yeah.
- Benji?

54
00:03:08,293 --> 00:03:09,293
They don't give a shit about that stuff, man.
I'm telling you...

55
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,460
Mm. I think they very much do
give a shit about that stuff.

56
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:11,751
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Really?
- Yeah.

57
00:03:11,918 --> 00:03:14,543
They're gonna arrest two Jews in Poland
for a little bit of weed?

58
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,710
- That's a good look for the Polish people.
- Okay. All right, all right. Just try to...

59
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:18,960
- keep it down, okay?
- Okay, yeah. Don't say, "marijuana."

60
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,460
- Arms out.
- Wait, really?

61
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:29,043
Sorry. It doesn't normally...
Thanks.

62
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,793
This one? This little one?

63
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,585
It's a gift from my dad.

64
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:34,710
- Dad?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:35,876
Of course it was.

66
00:03:36,835 --> 00:03:37,918
- Do you have something like this?
- No way.

67
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:41,418
- Yeah.
- I don't... I was way off. Okay, bye.

68
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:42,585
- Bye.
- Bye.

69
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:44,210
Oh. There you go.

70
00:03:46,335 --> 00:03:47,460
- She is so dope.
- Okay. Arms out.

71
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:49,418
- Who?
- The TSA agent.

72
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:50,876
Her dad does security for the Knicks.

73
00:03:51,043 --> 00:03:52,043
Huh.

74
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:04,210
Did you want some?

75
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:05,710
- Mm.
- Uh, Priya made it for me.

76
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:08,460
- Yeah, right.
- No. I'm... Yeah, okay.

77
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:09,668
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

78
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,710
What is that? A fucking Brazil nut?

79
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,418
Yo. So, like, how you been, man?

80
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:19,459
- Honestly, dude...
- Yeah.

81
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:21,876
I've been...

82
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,460
great. Been, like, really fucking great.

83
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:32,751
You wanna go over our
tour itinerary or anything?

84
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:33,835
Okay.

85
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,626
- Can you hold that for me, actually?
- Yeah, sure.

86
00:04:39,793 --> 00:04:42,001
- Yeah. Have as much as you want.
- Yeah?

87
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:47,001
Don't you think it'll be nice for us to
see where Grandma was from?

88
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:48,626
You know, where she lived?

89
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:49,626
Mm-hmm.

90
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,876
- I can't even follow this. I'll just...
- Sure.

91
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,668
- ...do whatever the group does.
- Sure.

92
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,501
Hi.

93
00:04:58,668 --> 00:04:59,668
What seat you got?

94
00:04:59,835 --> 00:05:01,085
24 A.

95
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:03,585
Mm. I'm B. I think we're middle and window.

96
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:05,835
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, man. You mind taking middle?

97
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:11,376
How you feeling in there, dude?

98
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
It's a little tight.

99
00:05:14,085 --> 00:05:16,335
- You still looking for a job?
- Nah.

100
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:19,751
So, you have to, like, work the whole trip?

101
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,710
No. No, no. I was able to take the week,
like, completely free.

102
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:24,043
- I wanna be here. I wanna be like...
- Great.

103
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,210
You know, I wanna be present.

104
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:26,710
- Good, man. Excellent.
- Yeah.

105
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:29,418
You still, like, sellin' shit online?

106
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:32,085
I mean,
I don't, like, sell used jerseys on eBay.

107
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:35,001
- I do, like, digital ad sales. Yeah.
- Okay.

108
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,043
So, you know, when you see, like,
an ad banner online?

109
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,460
Oh, yeah. God, I hate that shit.

110
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:40,626
Hey, come on.

111
00:05:40,793 --> 00:05:42,585
No, no. No, I just mean, like,
everybody hates that shit, you know.

112
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:43,751
- Do they?
- Mm, yeah.

113
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:45,126
- Well, that's what I do. That's my job.
- It's cool, man.

114
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:46,710
- I sell those. Okay.
- It's cool. It's cool, dude.

115
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:48,043
You're making the world go around. It's fine.

116
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,210
- Yeah.
- That's not your fault.

117
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:51,501
You're just, like,
part of a fucked-up system.

118
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:54,751
I mean, without online ads, actually,
a lot of the websites...

119
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:56,376
that you visit for free
wouldn't be able to exist.

120
00:05:56,543 --> 00:05:58,043
It's kind of like
the lifeblood of the Internet.

121
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,293
- Hey, dude, dude.
- Yeah.

122
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,501
I think they want us to pay attention.

123
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:02,751
Yeah, no, I just wanted to, like,
finish the story.

124
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:05,585
Yeah, yeah. No. It's just...
It's just kind of rude, man.

125
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:07,085
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

126
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:09,126
- Just trying to do their jobs.
<i>- To fasten your seatbelt...</i>

127
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:10,960
<i>insert the metal end into the...</i>

128
00:06:55,543 --> 00:06:57,626
<i>This is a security announcement.</i>

129
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:01,543
<i>Please maintain control of your
personal belongings at all time.</i>

130
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:06,626
Hey, are you okay?

131
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:08,668
Uh, yeah. I don't know.

132
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:11,626
Oh. There's our guy.
Yo. Dude.

133
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:12,918
- What's up? That's us.
- Hey.

134
00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:14,085
Kaplans.

135
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,751
What you looking at?

136
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,418
I don't know. It's stupid. I don't...

137
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:27,668
I think I'm already homesick.

138
00:07:27,835 --> 00:07:29,043
I don't know. It's just Abe.

139
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,460
He's, like, obsessed with buildings now.

140
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:32,335
He wants to know
the height of every skyscraper.

141
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:34,585
It's kind of, like, all-encompassing.

142
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:35,876
- Okay.
- Yeah.

143
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,126
Let me see it?

144
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:39,918
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

145
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:45,876
<i>That's right. And then how many floors
is the Empire State Building?</i>

146
00:07:46,043 --> 00:07:48,210
<i>103.</i>

147
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:50,626
<i>Okay. How many floors is 30 Hudson Yards?</i>

148
00:07:50,793 --> 00:07:54,293
<i>112. But the balcony is on the 100.</i>

149
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,293
<i>Yes!</i>

150
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,418
<i>How many floors is the Empire State Building?</i>

151
00:08:00,585 --> 00:08:02,710
<i>103.</i>

152
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:05,210
<i>Okay. How many floors is 30 Hudson Yards?</i>

153
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:06,710
<i>112.</i>

154
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:12,710
- You packed pajamas?
- Yeah, of course I did.

155
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:13,876
- Two pairs.
- Really? But really?

156
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:15,168
- You mean like the whole, like...
- You wanna borrow some?

157
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:17,668
what, Victorian nightgown
with the slippers and the cap?

158
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:19,668
No, man. I don't think I even own that.

159
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:22,418
Hi. Welcome to the Warsaw Central Hotel.

160
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,376
Thank you so much. Yeah, we're checking in.
We're with the Heritage Tour.

161
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:28,501
Kaplan, Benjamin and David.
I have our passports here.

162
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:30,251
- Yes, of course. Welcome.
- Thank you.

163
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:32,210
You're the final ones to arrive.

164
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,835
And I think I have a package for you.

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,125
- It's been sitting here for many days...
- That's for me, actually.

166
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:37,250
- Okay.
- Thank you.

167
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:38,835
- There you go.
- Thanks.

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,210
You're on the fifth floor, and there's
a group meeting in 30 minutes.

169
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,251
- Okay. Thank you so much.
- Great. Thank you. Fifth floor? Thanks.

170
00:08:45,418 --> 00:08:46,418
What the hell is that?

171
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,668
Oh, it's the weed. I told you.
It's like, really good stuff.

172
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:51,418
I got it from Todd.
This fucking barber in Ithaca.

173
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:53,668
Wait. You mailed yourself weed?

174
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:55,751
No, man. I mailed us weed.

175
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:58,460
Are you... I thought you were,
like, taking it through the airport.

176
00:08:59,043 --> 00:09:00,085
- Really?
- Yes, really.

177
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:01,460
Did you not see how nervous I was?

178
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:04,168
No, I did. I just thought that was you.

179
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:09,001
I'm so fuckin' happy
to be here with you right now.

180
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:11,418
Me too.

181
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:13,293
Oh, God.

182
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:18,251
All right. We got a half an hour.
I'm gonna have to shower.

183
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:19,626
Good idea.

184
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:22,501
Sweet! Closet.

185
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,460
Oh, yeah. Dude, I totally forgot.
You have super nice feet.

186
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:28,835
- Do I?
- Yeah...

187
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,501
and they've aged really well too.

188
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:32,001
Toes are mad straight. It's nice.

189
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:33,126
Okay. Thank you.

190
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:35,918
No weird feet knuckles
or stray hairs or anything. Very classy.

191
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,668
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

192
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:40,501
That's interesting.
I never really evaluated them, I guess.

193
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:42,251
You never evaluated your own feet?

194
00:09:42,418 --> 00:09:44,876
- No.
- Come on, dude. They're graceful as fuck.

195
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,960
Look at 'em.
They remind me of Grandma's feet.

196
00:09:47,126 --> 00:09:48,460
You remember Grandma's feet?

197
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:49,585
'Course I remember Grandma's feet.

198
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:52,543
She always wore those
pink plastic fuckin' sandals from Target.

199
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,460
- She used to strut that shit all over town.
- Really?

200
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:57,835
- You know, sometimes I look at you.
- Yeah?

201
00:09:58,001 --> 00:09:59,001
I see her.

202
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:01,043
I look like an old Jewish woman?

203
00:10:01,543 --> 00:10:04,793
No, man, you look wise.
And I don't know, it's beautiful.

204
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,126
- Really?
- Yeah.

205
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:08,251
Thanks. All right. All right.

206
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:09,418
- I'm gonna shower, okay?
- Cool.

207
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:11,085
- Yeah.
- Mind if I shower first?

208
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:12,085
No, sure.

209
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:13,668
Oh, hey, can I borrow your phone?

210
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:15,335
Yeah, sure. For what?

211
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:17,710
Just 'cause I like to
listen to music in the shower.

212
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:19,418
Don't you have a phone?

213
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:20,585
Yeah, but it doesn't play music.

214
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:23,710
Yeah, sure. Here you go.

215
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:25,626
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

216
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,043
Shower time.

217
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:55,835
- Hi. Sorry. Let me guess. David and Benjamin?
- Hi.

218
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:57,001
- Hi, yeah. You're James?
- Yeah.

219
00:10:57,168 --> 00:10:58,501
- Hi, yes. I am James. Hi.
- Hey. How's it going?

220
00:10:58,668 --> 00:10:59,668
- Hi. Benji.
- Yeah.

221
00:10:59,835 --> 00:11:01,418
- You're Benji? Okay, hi.
- Benji. Yeah. Benji. It's Benji.

222
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:02,918
Yeah, sorry. I didn't mean to accost you.

223
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:04,418
I just thought I should intercept...

224
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:06,085
- in case you weren't sure where we were.
- Thanks.

225
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:07,335
So, it's a nice, small group.

226
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,043
- Should be intimate, you know.
- Nice. Great.

227
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,543
- Success, everybody, found them.
- Hi.

228
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,918
This is David and Benji.

229
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:14,085
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey.

230
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:15,251
- Hi.
- Hi.

231
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:16,418
- Welcome.
- Sit down. Take a seat, please. Yeah.

232
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:18,043
Nice to meet you.
Oh, yeah. Thanks a lot. Yeah.

233
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,210
So, I won't ramble on for too long,
but a word about myself.

234
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:23,626
Hopefully, you won't be too sick of me
by the end of the week.

235
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:30,168
So my name is James, as you know.

236
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:33,251
I will be your British tour guide
through Poland.

237
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:36,668
I was a scholar of
Eastern European studies at Oxford.

238
00:11:36,835 --> 00:11:38,126
I'm not myself Jewish...

239
00:11:38,293 --> 00:11:39,876
but I'm completely obsessed...

240
00:11:40,043 --> 00:11:43,210
with this whole part of the world,
and in particular the Jewish experience...

241
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:44,668
which I find to be...

242
00:11:44,835 --> 00:11:48,085
fascinating and complex
and, at times, tragic...

243
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,168
but ultimately beautiful.

244
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,376
So, anyway, enough from me. Shut up, James.

245
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:54,960
Who wants to go next?

246
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:56,376
Okay, I'll be brave. Ha!

247
00:11:58,376 --> 00:12:00,543
Hi. I'm Marcia Kramer.

248
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,085
I'm originally from Brooklyn with...

249
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:08,835
two regrettable decades in Los Angeles,
and I've just moved back to New York...

250
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:10,335
after a divorce.

251
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:12,085
Sorry, if I'm oversharing...

252
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:15,001
but I found that I was turning into
the kind of...

253
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,126
woman I detested.

254
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:20,918
Just like a lady who lunches basically,
you know?

255
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:22,126
Oof.

256
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:25,585
My mother survived the camps and...

257
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:30,001
she never talked about it. Ever.

258
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:32,376
So, I'm here to honor her.

259
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:37,168
Okay, that's me. You go. Who's next?

260
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:39,585
Well, hi. Diane and Mark Binder.

261
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:40,751
Hello.

262
00:12:42,835 --> 00:12:43,835
We're boring.

263
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:46,918
Recently retired from Shaker Heights.

264
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:49,835
Mark's family was from here, down in Lublin.

265
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:53,751
But they left way before the war.
Turn of the century.

266
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:55,835
We were Mayflower Jews.

267
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:57,585
Was always my little joke.

268
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
- Yeah. Funny.
- Hi.

269
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:01,376
I'm Eloge.

270
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:06,501
As you might have guessed,
I was not born Jewish.

271
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:08,793
I guess you won't be
the only one on this trip, James.

272
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,418
Happy for the company, Eloge.

273
00:13:10,585 --> 00:13:11,710
Happy for the company.

274
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:15,293
But I did convert to Judaism,
around 10 years ago.

275
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,085
I'm actually African-born, Rwandan.

276
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,710
And to answer the question...

277
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:24,251
maybe you are thinking of asking,
I-I am a survivor of the genocide.

278
00:13:24,418 --> 00:13:25,585
Oh, snap.

279
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:28,293
Sorry. No, I just meant...

280
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,960
No, that's like...
I meant that in a good way. Like...

281
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:31,668
I don't know if you're familiar with "snap."

282
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:34,251
It's like, "Oh, shit."
"Oh, wow." "Holy..." You know...

283
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:36,876
I'm just interested in people
from other places. It's like...

284
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:39,001
I'm a fan, basically. Keep going, dude.

285
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:40,918
- I'm sorry about that.
- No. No, no, no.

286
00:13:41,668 --> 00:13:43,960
I'm very happy
when people are interested in my country.

287
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:45,126
- Oh.
- Sweet.

288
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:46,751
- What's your name?
- Benji.

289
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:49,418
- Benji, I'm an open book.
- Oh, rad.

290
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:52,876
So my mother and I survived the genocide.

291
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:56,918
And I moved to Winnipeg
with her life savings...

292
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:59,168
- sewn into the inside of my jacket...
- Jesus. Fuck.

293
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:03,876
And, in Winnipeg, I found a connection there
with a Jewish community.

294
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,460
Yeah, well, naturally.

295
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:07,251
Yes, naturally, Benji.

296
00:14:07,418 --> 00:14:11,376
And, when I learned about the Jewish story...

297
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:14,251
I felt at peace
for the first time since the war.

298
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:17,293
And the more I learn,
and the more people I meet...

299
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:20,168
wonderful people such as yourselves...

300
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,210
the more I know I made the right decision.

301
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,918
Wow.

302
00:14:27,376 --> 00:14:30,043
Well, I didn't expect to be crying
before the tour started.

303
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:33,210
- Wow. That's extraordinary.
- Wow.

304
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:35,335
- Thank you so much for that, Eloge.
- Yeah.

305
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,876
- Thank you.
- That was beautiful.

306
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,501
- Well, who the hell wants to follow that?
- Yeah.

307
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,085
Okay, shit. I guess I'll go.

308
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:46,376
So, Davers and I are cousins. We've...

309
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:48,335
Actually, we were born three weeks apart...

310
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:49,751
- which is kinda nuts.
- Yes.

311
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:52,751
A zloty for anyone
who can guess which one of us is older.

312
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:54,001
Me!

313
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:55,668
Our dads are brothers.

314
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:57,710
We're basically brothers, too,
wouldn't you say, Dave?

315
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:00,626
We used to be joined at the hip.
Like feckin Katie and Eilish.

316
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:02,168
- Remember them?
- Yeah. Don't say that.

317
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,460
But, our grandma, Dory...
Grandma Dory, she was from here.

318
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:08,835
And we've always wanted to...

319
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:12,043
see where she came from
and see the house that she grew up in.

320
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,918
Yeah, that's actually why
we're leaving the tour a day early.

321
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:15,876
- Benji insisted on seeing her little town.
- Yeah. 'Course, yeah.

322
00:15:16,043 --> 00:15:17,543
- They were... They were super close.
- We have to.

323
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,835
Yeah. I mean,
she was the fucking coolest, right?

324
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,751
Well, now I've just been, like...

325
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:25,085
in a real funk, I guess, since she died.
Just haven't...

326
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:31,960
Yeah. Sorry. She was just
my favorite person in the world.

327
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:40,710
You know, it's, it's good to remember.
That's why we're here, in a way. So...

328
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:42,751
Thank you, James. Thanks for saying that.

329
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:46,710
So...
Yeah, it's okay.

330
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:48,668
Just to, like, just keep things
on track, though. Like...

331
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:50,960
- Yeah.
- Sorry. When she died...

332
00:15:51,126 --> 00:15:53,418
she left some money in her will
for me and Benji to come here, so...

333
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,626
Yeah, and Dave is always, like, super busy.

334
00:15:55,793 --> 00:15:58,126
He never has time. He's got this, like,
high-pressure job selling...

335
00:15:58,293 --> 00:16:00,251
- fucking ad banners to the Internet.
- Yo, come on, man.

336
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,668
But he knew I was in
a real shit place recently, so he...

337
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:07,626
swooped in and dropped everything
and arranged for us to join this...

338
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:11,418
geriatric Polish tour with you fine people.

339
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:12,501
Hey.

340
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:49,251
Okay, if everyone could gather over here
just for a moment, please?

341
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:50,418
No rush.

342
00:16:56,418 --> 00:17:01,293
I always like to start my tours here
at the Ghetto Uprising Memorial.

343
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,751
And that's because this is a monument
that celebrates the Jewish heroes...

344
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:06,793
who fought back against the Nazis.

345
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:10,334
In a couple of days, I will be taking us
to a concentration camp...

346
00:17:10,501 --> 00:17:13,084
so I think it's important
to immediately dispel the myth...

347
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:16,584
that these were a people
who were led like lambs to the slaughter.

348
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:20,209
Now, it may seem obvious,
but a word of warnin'...

349
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:23,043
this will be a tour about pain.

350
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,501
Of course, it will.

351
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,959
Pain and suffering and loss,
there's no getting around that...

352
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:29,626
but I think it's important
that it's also a tour...

353
00:17:29,793 --> 00:17:31,168
that celebrates a people.

354
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,876
A most resilient people.

355
00:17:38,418 --> 00:17:39,418
All right.

356
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:41,918
So, that's that one then.

357
00:17:45,126 --> 00:17:48,793
This city has
an incredibly unfortunate history.

358
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,793
It's often called the Phoenix City...

359
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,085
because it's risen from the ashes
so many times.

360
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:58,501
Functionality of this Soviet-style
architecture, you know, can be polarizing.

361
00:17:58,668 --> 00:17:59,668
It's not to everyone's...

362
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:02,251
And again, you'll notice
that austere style...

363
00:18:02,418 --> 00:18:04,335
which sprung up in the wake of World War II.

364
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,335
Look at this shit.

365
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:08,293
We'd probably live here
if the war didn't happen.

366
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,793
Isn't that fucking crazy to think about?

367
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,043
Seriously, like,
we think of ourselves as these, like...

368
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,501
very American creations, you know?
And I guess that we are.

369
00:18:15,668 --> 00:18:17,251
I guess, that's, like,
the essence of America...

370
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:19,043
people created from other cultures.

371
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:22,210
But, like, in some parallel, black hole
universe, you and I are Polish...

372
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:25,293
and we probably got, like, long beards
and we can't shake hands with women.

373
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,835
Yeah, that's funny.
You know, every time I see, like...

374
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:29,126
one of those Hasidic guys on the street,
I always just think, like...

375
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:32,043
"There but for the grace of no God go I."
You know?

376
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,043
What?

377
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,210
Oh, nothing. It's just, like,
a dumb joke that...

378
00:18:36,126 --> 00:18:37,460
- Yeah.
- Well, that's cool, man.

379
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:40,376
- Shit, look at her.
- Who?

380
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:41,710
That woman, Marcia.

381
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:43,585
She's walkin' alone.
We should go talk to her.

382
00:18:44,418 --> 00:18:45,585
We just met her.

383
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:49,001
Yeah, but she's got this, like, deep sadness
behind her eyes, you know?

384
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:50,126
She does?

385
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:51,293
Yeah. You didn't notice that?

386
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:53,501
During the introductions? No. I...

387
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:54,918
I think we should check on her.

388
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:56,335
Benji, maybe she wants to be alone.

389
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,293
No one wants to be alone, Dave.
Okay, I'm gonna go check it out.

390
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,085
Hey. Why are you walking alone?
Are you a big fucking loser?

391
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:05,835
- Seriously?
- Yeah. You look like an interesting person.

392
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:07,918
- Sorry.
- Okay.

393
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:10,585
This is one of the most
well-preserved sections...

394
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:12,793
of the Warsaw Ghetto
and was part of the wall...

395
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,418
from November 1940 to November 1942.

396
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:20,418
And, as we traverse the city,
you'll actually notice the fact that...

397
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:27,960
Here you go. Water. Diane. Mark. There we go.

398
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,376
Gotta drink. It's important. James, Eloge.

399
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:31,876
Marcia, hydrate.

400
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:43,751
Okay. Ready to go?

401
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:45,585
What we waitin' on?

402
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:51,626
New Delhi has no delis in it.
Where are the knishes?

403
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:57,335
Oh, it was the airport,
but it wasn't new, it was old.

404
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,960
Yo!

405
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:02,126
Hey.

406
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:04,418
Come on in.

407
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:06,293
Thanks.

408
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,043
- Thanks?
- Yeah. No, I mean, I saved this.

409
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,210
I don't know if you were gonna...

410
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,043
- yeah, sit over there.
- No, man.

411
00:20:12,918 --> 00:20:14,668
So, what was going on with that woman?

412
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:16,043
What do you mean?

413
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,668
The woman with, like,
the "sadness in her eyes."

414
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:20,126
- Marcia.
- Yeah. Is she all right?

415
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:22,585
- She's in a really weird place right now.
- Really?

416
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:23,918
- She told you that?
- Yeah.

417
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:26,335
I guess she thinks that I can relate
since we've both lost people.

418
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:27,668
Yeah. You mean our grandma?

419
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:30,210
Yeah. She's just, like,
super fucking stressed right now...

420
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:33,293
because her husband left her last May,
like, totally out of the blue.

421
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,293
Jesus.

422
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,335
She's seeing this new guy, Darren,
which you'd think she'd be happy about...

423
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:39,085
but he sounds like a total fucking douchebag.

424
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:40,293
Really? How?

425
00:20:42,835 --> 00:20:43,710
I don't know, man.

426
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,335
I don't think we should be talking about her
behind her back.

427
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:48,751
- Okay. I was just... I was just asking.
- I know.

428
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:50,293
But... still.

429
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,668
Weird soup, right?

430
00:20:55,876 --> 00:20:57,001
I fucking love it.

431
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:03,210
When it comes to the Warsaw Uprising...

432
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:06,251
I think the most bizarre
and harrowing aspect...

433
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:08,626
is not the German crushing
of the rebellion...

434
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:11,043
but the part that the Russians played in it.

435
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,293
You see, the Russians and the Poles
were supposedly allies.

436
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,793
Brothers in arms fighting
against a common enemy.

437
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:19,501
I'm sure you'd like to take some photographs.

438
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,126
Please don't hesitate
to ask me any questions.

439
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:24,001
Always happy to fill you in...

440
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:25,751
- You like that guy?
- Yeah.

441
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,793
Hey, Eloge, when you're done...

442
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,543
sorry, could you get a picture
of me and Dave...

443
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,293
- posing with the guys?
- Yeah, of course.

444
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:33,251
- Thank you, man.
- Sorry, what?

445
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,835
We should pose with the guys.
It'll be hysterical.

446
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:38,668
Doesn't that seem, like, disrespectful or...

447
00:21:38,835 --> 00:21:40,626
Fuck is that disrespectful?
We're on their side.

448
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:42,085
Fightin' the fucking Russkies and the Krauts.

449
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:43,793
- Come on.
- I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, I don't...

450
00:21:44,585 --> 00:21:45,585
I don't really know if we should.

451
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:48,626
Can you just get a picture of me, then,
fighting with my Polish brethren?

452
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,043
Yeah.

453
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,626
Gentlemen, I'm goin' in.

454
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:54,085
No, that's the leaves.

455
00:21:54,585 --> 00:21:57,001
Sorry, I'm late.
Got a war to win, or to lose, probably.

456
00:21:58,418 --> 00:21:59,710
That's really... You look great, Benji.

457
00:21:59,876 --> 00:22:01,543
- Got some good shots.
- Does it look real?

458
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,001
Well, they're twice the size of you
and metal.

459
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:05,501
So, you know, no.

460
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:07,085
I need some help. You wanna come up here?

461
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:08,710
No, I'm good. I'm good. Really.

462
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:10,793
Eloge! You gonna enlist?

463
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,835
I'm not a fighter, Benji. Thank you.

464
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:15,335
Okay, well, then you can be a medic
or something. These people need help.

465
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,585
- This is so silly.
- I know.

466
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:19,335
Come on. Your mom will love the pictures.

467
00:22:20,876 --> 00:22:22,335
- Can you take my picture for me, please?
- Come on.

468
00:22:22,918 --> 00:22:23,918
Hey, Marcia.

469
00:22:24,418 --> 00:22:25,626
- Just one.
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

470
00:22:26,335 --> 00:22:27,543
That's what I'm talkin' about.

471
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,960
So, you're the medic,
you gotta patch up this guy's leg.

472
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:31,460
- Okay.
- He's in a lot of pain.

473
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:33,001
- Okay.
- He really needs you.

474
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:35,043
Need to reassure him as well. Talk to him.

475
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,710
Don't worry. I'm here to help.

476
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:38,001
You're taking such good care.

477
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:39,626
We got a young Florrie Nightingale over here.

478
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:40,918
Dave, you gettin' all this?

479
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:42,376
- Yeah, I got it.
- Is it funny?

480
00:22:42,543 --> 00:22:44,085
Yeah, it's funny. Yeah.

481
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:46,585
You sure you don't wanna come up here?
We could use the manpower.

482
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:49,585
No, that's okay. I'll just...
You know, I'll watch from central command.

483
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:50,751
Central...

484
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:52,460
Central command. That's a good one, Dave.

485
00:22:52,626 --> 00:22:53,626
Can I join up?

486
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,876
General Marcus.
We're honored to have you, sir.

487
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,043
- At ease.
- Marcia.

488
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,251
- Okay. Thank you.
- Get on up here!

489
00:22:59,418 --> 00:23:01,960
- Marcia, I need more supplies.
- Yeah. Wanna be a medic too?

490
00:23:02,126 --> 00:23:04,043
No, I don't wanna be a medic.
Don't I have a gun or something?

491
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,585
Fuckin' A. Look at you.

492
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,626
Oh, God. I can't believe I'm doing this.
Thank you, David.

493
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:10,126
- No, sure. No problem.
- Are you sure don't wanna go up there?

494
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:11,751
No, it's fine.
I got some good shots earlier...

495
00:23:11,918 --> 00:23:12,835
when it was, like, empty.

496
00:23:13,251 --> 00:23:17,043
Jimothy! Sir, we need a gunner
from the RAF, old chap.

497
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,210
I'm coming!

498
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,543
Gonna be dropped out of the plane.

499
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,751
Or are you the actual plane?

500
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:25,126
I guess I am the plane.

501
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,210
Then you're a plane.

502
00:23:30,043 --> 00:23:30,960
Okay, Dave, you ready?

503
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:32,293
Okay, everybody, pick a pose and freeze.

504
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,376
You gettin' this, Dave?
My arm's gettin' pretty tired.

505
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:48,960
Yeah. It's my last phone. One second.

506
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:50,293
Okay. Okay, I got it.

507
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,710
Okay, stand down, men.

508
00:23:51,876 --> 00:23:53,418
We were all very brave.
Unfortunately, we all...

509
00:23:53,585 --> 00:23:55,751
A whole elaborate story unfolding there.

510
00:23:55,918 --> 00:23:56,918
My knees.

511
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,626
Thank you so much, man.
That was a lot of fun.

512
00:23:58,793 --> 00:23:59,793
- Thanks.
- No problem. No, it was, like...

513
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,335
- That was fun.
- It was so much fun.

514
00:24:03,751 --> 00:24:07,043
You are? Okay. Well, let me know
if you need any help with...

515
00:24:07,418 --> 00:24:09,043
- any recommendations...
- Nice.

516
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:15,501
All right, well done, everyone.

517
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:17,585
It's fantastic.

518
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,668
This is us. Good night, you freaks.

519
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:22,835
- Night.
- Night.

520
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:24,085
Long day tomorrow.

521
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,501
- Hey, Dave?
- Yep.

522
00:24:31,668 --> 00:24:33,126
Come meet me in the bathroom for a second.

523
00:24:33,918 --> 00:24:34,918
What? Why?

524
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:39,001
- Hi.
- Hey.

525
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,210
So, um, why are we in here?

526
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:46,335
So, I just wanted to say thank you so much
for being here with me.

527
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:49,668
I know that it's tough for you to
take time off work and to leave your boy...

528
00:24:51,085 --> 00:24:52,585
but I really needed this, man.

529
00:24:52,751 --> 00:24:53,918
- Really?
- Yeah.

530
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:56,085
Well, that's, that's great, man.

531
00:24:56,251 --> 00:24:59,126
I'm, like, just happy to see you happy.

532
00:24:59,293 --> 00:25:01,251
I know it's been, like,
such a tough few months for you, so I...

533
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,793
I also want to say that I know
you're not the most comfortable person...

534
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,918
with groups and people
and social shit like that.

535
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:08,085
- I'm not?
- No.

536
00:25:08,251 --> 00:25:12,168
But it's amazing that you're here,
putting yourself out there so boldly for me.

537
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:15,376
- Well, thank you, man.
- Let's go smoke a joint.

538
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,793
Yep. Infantilizing, corporate bullshit.

539
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
What do you mean?

540
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:24,335
How the fuck are we supposed
to smoke a joint in here?

541
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:27,376
They fuckin' locked the windows.
It's like a goddamn police state.

542
00:25:27,543 --> 00:25:30,251
Yo, man. I think I might just wanna crash.
We've been up for, like, 24 hours.

543
00:25:30,418 --> 00:25:32,085
Don't. Don't tell me
you're gonna sleep on me.

544
00:25:32,251 --> 00:25:33,835
This is our first night together
in fuckin' years.

545
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:35,460
I don't know. I'm exhausted.
I haven't showered.

546
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:37,626
You're exhausted?
Dude, the weed's gonna help you sleep.

547
00:25:37,793 --> 00:25:39,543
Is it the kind that helps you sleep?

548
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,543
- No, it's the other kind.
- Come on.

549
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:42,918
- Dude.
- What?

550
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:45,043
Take a shower, brush your fuckin' face.

551
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,085
Like, floss your butt. Do whatever it is
you gotta do to feel like you.

552
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:50,585
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna roll us a fat fuckin' joint...

553
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:52,376
and we'll go to the roof. Okay?

554
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,001
Okay. Where are ya?

555
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:06,626
I don't know. Maybe they don't make their
roof accessible for American assholes...

556
00:26:06,793 --> 00:26:07,960
trying to smoke weed?

557
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:09,960
I think this might be it. Think this is it?

558
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:12,043
I think there's a big fucking alarm
that's gonna go off.

559
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,460
So? If it goes off,
we just say we don't speak Polish.

560
00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:15,626
Which happens to be true.

561
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,001
I think... I don't know, man.

562
00:26:18,168 --> 00:26:19,626
I think we should probably just go back down.

563
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:21,585
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

564
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:25,001
Yeah. I don't feel right about this.

565
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,376
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

566
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,168
Yeah. If you're not feeling good about it,
let's not do it.

567
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:31,668
Sorry. I don't know. That's lame, I guess.

568
00:26:31,835 --> 00:26:33,835
- No, that's okay. It's not lame. It's just...
- Benji!

569
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:48,543
Hustle. We're almost there.

570
00:26:57,876 --> 00:26:59,210
Yeah. There's my guy.

571
00:26:59,876 --> 00:27:00,876
How you feeling, dude?

572
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,460
I feel okay.

573
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,210
Feel okay.

574
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:06,418
- David.
- Yeah?

575
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:07,585
How are you feeling, man?

576
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,126
- No, I feel good.
- Yeah?

577
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:10,335
Yeah. I feel good.

578
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:12,168
You just needed a little drugs
in your system. That's all.

579
00:27:12,335 --> 00:27:13,335
- Really?
- Yeah.

580
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,460
- That's all I was missing, huh?
- That's all you were missin'.

581
00:27:15,626 --> 00:27:16,626
- There you go.
- That's it.

582
00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:19,168
You...

583
00:27:20,168 --> 00:27:21,918
are like an awesome guy...

584
00:27:22,085 --> 00:27:24,335
stuck inside the body of somebody
who's always running late.

585
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:27,085
I gotta fish that fuckin' guy out of you...

586
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:28,668
every time I see you.

587
00:27:28,835 --> 00:27:30,710
Thank you, I think.

588
00:27:30,876 --> 00:27:32,793
You know, dude, when I think
about the two of us, man...

589
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Yeah?

590
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:36,251
I think of us walking around New York
all night...

591
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:38,043
trying to stay up until morning.

592
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,751
- You always did.
- Mm-hmm.

593
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:43,251
- Yeah.
- And you always passed out halfway through.

594
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:46,251
We'd make it over the Williamsburg Bridge...

595
00:27:46,418 --> 00:27:49,835
and you would conk out
on a bench in Chinatown.

596
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,168
Yeah, I know.

597
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:54,293
You're kind of a lightweight.

598
00:28:18,293 --> 00:28:19,293
Dave?

599
00:28:20,043 --> 00:28:21,043
Yo.

600
00:28:23,376 --> 00:28:25,085
Sorry I called you a lightweight.

601
00:28:26,793 --> 00:28:27,793
That's okay.

602
00:28:28,543 --> 00:28:30,085
I'm sorry I would always fall asleep.

603
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:31,835
Nah, man.

604
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,918
You had, like, a job and a wife.

605
00:28:35,126 --> 00:28:36,835
You'd been awake all day...

606
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:38,626
doing important shit.

607
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:41,168
I didn't really have anything going on.

608
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:45,835
I didn't care that you fell asleep, man.
I was just glad you were there.

609
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:25,001
- What did he say?
<i>- Just absolutely despising.</i>

610
00:29:25,168 --> 00:29:26,543
- Really?
<i>- Yeah. That was a bit of a disaster...</i>

611
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,835
<i>if you ask me, but...</i>

612
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:29,001
That's really funny.

613
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:30,751
Benji.

614
00:29:31,751 --> 00:29:34,210
We gotta go. The train's in an hour, okay?

615
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:40,376
Sorry we're a little late.

616
00:29:40,543 --> 00:29:43,376
Yeah, Dave woke me up
literally two minutes ago.

617
00:29:43,543 --> 00:29:44,543
All right.

618
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:58,460
Train's arriving in two minutes. Come on.

619
00:30:00,376 --> 00:30:01,251
I really appreciate it.

620
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:02,668
You're okay?

621
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:05,210
I know it's kind of heavy. Sorry.

622
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:10,210
Right. Come on, everyone.
Gotta get right to the end of the platform.

623
00:30:11,668 --> 00:30:14,585
Okay, everyone,
so, part of our tour package...

624
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:16,876
included these first-class tickets.

625
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,918
Nice little perk for us all. Keep coming.

626
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,585
We gotta get right to the end, everyone.

627
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:23,043
I like a first-class ticket.

628
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,793
Love the exchange rate.

629
00:30:25,668 --> 00:30:26,668
Excuse me.

630
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:36,210
Now, if you've got time
we could swing by Underground Lublin.

631
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
It is fascinating.

632
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:39,668
I just think it's a bit overhyped, personally.

633
00:30:40,168 --> 00:30:42,418
The big hitter is the Grodzka Gate,
you know...

634
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:44,210
Is the gate still accessible?

635
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,210
- Yo, dude, I think we should move.
- What?

636
00:30:46,793 --> 00:30:48,293
I think we should move to another train car.

637
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,460
What do you mean?

638
00:30:49,626 --> 00:30:51,501
You don't feel weird
being in a first-class car?

639
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:53,585
- No. We paid for it.
- No?

640
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:54,960
It's not hurting anybody, no.

641
00:30:55,126 --> 00:30:58,251
Dude, we are Jews on a train in Poland.
Fucking think about it.

642
00:30:58,418 --> 00:30:59,918
- I am. I'm...
- Benji?

643
00:31:00,085 --> 00:31:01,043
- Benji.
- Yeah?

644
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,376
You all right up there?

645
00:31:02,543 --> 00:31:03,751
- Yeah. Sure.
- Yeah.

646
00:31:03,918 --> 00:31:05,710
- Sorry.
- Yeah, no. No worries.

647
00:31:05,876 --> 00:31:07,710
I mean, you know, it's, to be fair,
fascinating...

648
00:31:07,876 --> 00:31:09,376
- No, I mean, I just feel like... Sorry.
- Okay.

649
00:31:09,543 --> 00:31:12,460
I just... Does any...
Is anyone else, like, feeling this right now?

650
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:14,043
Feeling what?

651
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,001
Like this creepy feeling that, like,
you know, we're, like, royalty on this train?

652
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:19,876
I mean, does no one else see the irony here?

653
00:31:20,043 --> 00:31:21,710
- Jesus. Benji, come on, man.
- Like eating fancy food...

654
00:31:21,876 --> 00:31:23,960
and sitting up here, when 80 years ago...

655
00:31:24,126 --> 00:31:26,710
we would've been herded into the backs
of these fucking things like cattle.

656
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:28,001
- God.
- Okay, Benji...

657
00:31:28,168 --> 00:31:30,210
I don't think anybody here
wants to hear that right now.

658
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:32,126
Okay, why not?
Why doesn't anyone want to hear it?

659
00:31:32,293 --> 00:31:33,960
- Because it's depressing, man.
- Depressing?

660
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:36,001
Okay, look. That's okay. You're raising
an interesting sensitivity here.

661
00:31:36,168 --> 00:31:38,085
It does sometimes come up on these tours.

662
00:31:38,251 --> 00:31:39,668
You're staying in fancy hotels...

663
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:41,168
eating posh food, and at the same time...

664
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:44,501
you're looking back
at the horrors of your family history.

665
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:48,543
It can conjure up confusing feelings
of discomfort and discordance...

666
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,543
and dare I say, even a kinda guilt, you know.

667
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,876
You're comparing your own life...

668
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:54,043
I don't feel guilt.

669
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,251
- No. Nor should you, Mark.
- Why would I feel guilt?

670
00:31:56,418 --> 00:31:58,001
No, I'm not saying that you
have to feel guilt. I'm just saying that...

671
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:00,085
Well, because our lives
are so fucking pampered and privileged.

672
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,543
Like, we completely cut ourselves off
from anyone else's true pain.

673
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,710
Like the actual fuckin' experience
of being shoved in a train car...

674
00:32:06,876 --> 00:32:08,585
- your fuckin' head bashed in.
- Jesus, Benji.

675
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:09,793
- So, what are we supposed to do about that?
- Mark. Mark, Mark, please.

676
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,668
Fuckin' acknowledge it, man.
Like, try to feel it in some way.

677
00:32:12,835 --> 00:32:15,043
- Why are you doing this?
- Dude, I'm just fuckin' saying how I feel.

678
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,668
Okay. Why is that, like, important now?

679
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:20,085
Oh, man, you used to feel everything, man.

680
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:23,001
He was such an anxious,
adorable fucking kid, man.

681
00:32:23,168 --> 00:32:24,710
- Jesus, Benji.
- We went to Jewy sleep-away camp together.

682
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,585
- Come on, man.
- He cried the whole first week.

683
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:28,876
The whole fucking first week
'cause he was homesick.

684
00:32:29,043 --> 00:32:30,418
- Jesus.
- I used to have to hug him to sleep...

685
00:32:30,585 --> 00:32:32,710
and talk about his sweet fuckin' mom
to calm him down and shit.

686
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:33,960
- Jesus Christ, man. What the fuck?
- Now look at him.

687
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:36,168
He's like all put together
and comfortable and shit.

688
00:32:36,335 --> 00:32:39,210
Topiaries his wild-ass Jew fro
into submission.

689
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:40,835
It's mad impressive.
You're all mad impressive.

690
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,126
But you know what?

691
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,835
I'm gonna go
to the back of the train now, okay?

692
00:32:44,543 --> 00:32:46,376
I don't think you'll find much suffering
back there either.

693
00:32:46,543 --> 00:32:47,751
Stop it. Please.

694
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,418
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

695
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:56,293
Okay, I hope that wasn't too uncomfortable
for everyone.

696
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,460
Obviously, there are...

697
00:32:58,168 --> 00:33:00,418
triggers along the way with this tour.

698
00:33:00,585 --> 00:33:02,835
I must say the train is not normally
one of them, but...

699
00:33:04,085 --> 00:33:05,543
James, I should probably head back there.

700
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,835
I don't know. I should at least, like,
bring him his food or something.

701
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:09,793
Of course. Yeah.
You know where we're gettin' off?

702
00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:13,168
Yeah, it's, like, Lublin Główny?
I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it.

703
00:33:13,335 --> 00:33:14,418
No. It's very close.

704
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:15,501
- Yeah, it's... All right. Good luck.
- Okay, thanks. Sorry.

705
00:33:15,668 --> 00:33:16,751
Sorry, everybody.

706
00:33:17,835 --> 00:33:18,835
Okay.

707
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:47,710
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

708
00:33:48,585 --> 00:33:49,585
Thanks.

709
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:51,626
Are you okay?

710
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,668
Everyone just wants
to have a fucking joyride, you know?

711
00:33:56,876 --> 00:33:58,418
No. What do you mean?

712
00:33:59,668 --> 00:34:01,835
People can't walk around the world being...

713
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,543
happy all the time.

714
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,293
It's okay, man.

715
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,960
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

716
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:42,335
Did I fall asleep?

717
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:44,376
- Yeah, you did.
- Shit.

718
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:47,251
Shit! We gotta go. We gotta go. Come on.

719
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,918
All right, I guess everybody's waiting
in front for us.

720
00:34:57,543 --> 00:34:59,876
Mm-hmm. Maybe.

721
00:35:00,043 --> 00:35:01,043
- Hey, duder?
- Yeah?

722
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,168
Yeah, we're not at the right station, dude.

723
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,210
Sorry, what?

724
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:06,376
Yeah.

725
00:35:08,293 --> 00:35:10,460
Shit. What the fuck is Kraśnik?

726
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:12,626
- Yeah, Kraśnik.
- We were supposed to get off at Lublin.

727
00:35:12,793 --> 00:35:15,543
No, I know. Yeah.
You were out pretty fucking cold, dude.

728
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,418
Sorry. You mean, we passed Lublin already?

729
00:35:17,585 --> 00:35:18,585
Like, a while ago.

730
00:35:18,751 --> 00:35:19,918
And you didn't wake me up?

731
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:22,210
- You were having such a good nap, dude.
- Jesus Christ!

732
00:35:22,418 --> 00:35:23,918
- We are on a tour group with people.
- You were, like... I'm sorry.

733
00:35:24,085 --> 00:35:25,043
Yeah, I know. I just didn't have
the heart to wake you up, man.

734
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,001
You have, like,
the most fucked-up sense of priorities.

735
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,918
Do you know that?
Do you know that?

736
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,168
Dude, don't get mad at me. Okay?

737
00:35:30,335 --> 00:35:31,585
- How could I not get mad at you?
- Because I was, like...

738
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:33,335
- staring at you while you were sleeping...
- Yeah.

739
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:34,543
and people were lookin' at you.

740
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,001
And some people
were fucking laughing at you...

741
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:38,335
'cause you were snoring
all weird and loud and shit.

742
00:35:38,501 --> 00:35:40,293
But I was thinkin', like, "Fuck that."

743
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:42,251
This is my cousin Davey.
I'm not ashamed of him.

744
00:35:42,418 --> 00:35:44,376
This is Davey on the bench in Chinatown.

745
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:47,043
This is the guy I used to have all to myself.
I just couldn't wake you, man.

746
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:51,585
- All right. All right, so what do we do now?
- Yeah.

747
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:52,918
- Got that shit worked out, dude.
- Did you?

748
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:54,126
Yeah. While you were sleepin'.

749
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:55,418
Okay.

750
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:57,376
So, we just get on a train
going in the opposite direction.

751
00:35:57,543 --> 00:35:58,668
- Yeah, okay.
- And we don't even have to pay for tickets.

752
00:35:58,835 --> 00:36:00,085
We just avoid the conductor
until we get there.

753
00:36:00,251 --> 00:36:02,460
I do this kinda shit all the time Upstate.
It's fucking foolproof.

754
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:03,710
- This might be us, dude.
- Really?

755
00:36:03,876 --> 00:36:05,335
- Run! Run, run, run.
- Great.

756
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:11,001
Yo, we should just buy tickets
like normal people.

757
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:12,460
There's no time. Come on.

758
00:36:13,376 --> 00:36:14,376
Shit.

759
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:17,043
Dude.

760
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:20,043
We stay moving, we stay light, we stay agile.

761
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,960
The conductor's gonna come through
taking tickets.

762
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:23,501
- We tell him we're going to the bathroom.
- The bathroom? Okay.

763
00:36:23,668 --> 00:36:24,668
He gets to the back of the train...

764
00:36:24,835 --> 00:36:26,460
he's gonna start heading towards
the front looking for stragglers.

765
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:27,751
- Sorry. We're the stragglers?
- Yeah.

766
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:28,918
By the time he gets to the front...

767
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:30,251
the train's gonna be in the station
and we're home free.

768
00:36:30,418 --> 00:36:31,418
This is so fucking stupid.

769
00:36:31,585 --> 00:36:33,335
Man, what's stupid
is the corporatization of travel.

770
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:35,043
Ensuring that the rich
move around the world...

771
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,168
propagate their elitist loins,
while the poor stay cut off from society.

772
00:36:38,335 --> 00:36:40,668
That's great. We can argue Marxism
while they're hauling us off to Siberia.

773
00:36:40,835 --> 00:36:42,001
Siberia is in Russia, Dave.

774
00:36:42,168 --> 00:36:44,001
This is ridiculous.
Tickets are probably, like, 12 bucks.

775
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:45,168
It's the principle of paying.

776
00:36:45,335 --> 00:36:47,376
We shouldn't have to pay for train tickets
in Poland. This is our country.

777
00:36:47,543 --> 00:36:48,626
No, it's not. It was our country.

778
00:36:48,793 --> 00:36:50,210
They kicked us out
'cause they thought we were cheap.

779
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:55,543
Okay, this is it.
Stay calm. Act natural.

780
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,751
Yeah.

781
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,918
Hi. Just bathroom.

782
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:02,210
Me and cousin go to just bathroom.

783
00:37:02,376 --> 00:37:04,501
- Bathrooms on either side.
- With thanks.

784
00:37:04,668 --> 00:37:05,751
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

785
00:37:05,918 --> 00:37:07,668
And we have our tickets. We just...

786
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:11,335
Jesus Christ.
My heart is in my fucking throat.

787
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:12,710
- Feels good, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

788
00:37:12,876 --> 00:37:14,501
We're not out of the woods yet, though.
We gotta get to the front...

789
00:37:14,668 --> 00:37:16,126
and take shelter
until we get to our stop. Okay?

790
00:37:16,293 --> 00:37:17,293
- Okay.
- Ready?

791
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,460
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

792
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,376
- Here, here.
- What? Yeah.

793
00:37:37,876 --> 00:37:38,876
We made it.

794
00:37:39,043 --> 00:37:40,335
Don't fall asleep on me again, brother.

795
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:41,501
I won't.

796
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,210
Hey, Benji.

797
00:37:47,376 --> 00:37:48,376
Yeah?

798
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:50,043
We're in first class.

799
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,585
Yeah, but we fucking earned it.

800
00:38:02,585 --> 00:38:04,001
Hey, should we stop and get some lunch?

801
00:38:04,168 --> 00:38:05,293
- No.
- Okay.

802
00:38:09,043 --> 00:38:10,168
Hi. Sorry.

803
00:38:10,335 --> 00:38:12,543
Hey, everybody. Sorry we're late.
Dave fell asleep.

804
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,710
Yeah.
What?

805
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,001
- Hi, there.
- We got your bags.

806
00:38:17,168 --> 00:38:18,668
That's so nice of you. I'm so sorry.

807
00:38:18,835 --> 00:38:20,251
Yeah, he just...
He needed to sleepy sleep.

808
00:38:20,418 --> 00:38:22,251
- Sorry about that. Yeah. Here's your bag.
- You need some help.

809
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:23,626
- Yeah, let's drop our bags off at the hotel.
- He got sleepy.

810
00:38:23,793 --> 00:38:25,501
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah, yeah. All good. I'm really sorry.

811
00:38:25,668 --> 00:38:28,418
Yeah. It was actually really quick
once we were able to get on the other...

812
00:38:32,585 --> 00:38:35,043
...and importance of the Jewish contribution.

813
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,501
Lublin has such a rich Jewish history.

814
00:38:37,668 --> 00:38:40,668
It was actually known, for a time,
as the Jewish Oxford.

815
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:44,501
It was diverse,
both culturally and intellectually.

816
00:38:44,668 --> 00:38:47,376
This is the Lublin of Rebbe Horowitz...

817
00:38:47,543 --> 00:38:49,710
of the Seer of Lublin...

818
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:53,960
of Isaac Bashevis Singer,
merchants, writers, poets.

819
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,501
So, you're, like, really religious? Yeah?

820
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:02,168
Yes. Yes, you could say that.

821
00:39:02,335 --> 00:39:04,001
It's amazing to me.

822
00:39:04,168 --> 00:39:05,626
- Is it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

823
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:07,626
So, you, like, do all the customs
and everything?

824
00:39:07,793 --> 00:39:09,960
No, no, not all. No.

825
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:11,710
But I do like to keep Shabbat.

826
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:14,960
No matter what's going on with my life...

827
00:39:15,126 --> 00:39:16,918
once a week, I get to...

828
00:39:17,418 --> 00:39:20,460
slow down and take my rest seriously.

829
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:23,376
And you?

830
00:39:23,543 --> 00:39:24,626
No. Me? No, no.

831
00:39:24,793 --> 00:39:27,001
I mean, the whole thing
always seemed like a little...

832
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:30,668
I don't know, arbitrary and mechanical
and archaic to me.

833
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,668
I mean, no offense, obviously.

834
00:39:34,001 --> 00:39:36,210
I think it would really benefit you.

835
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:39,376
You mean, like, benefit everybody
or, like, me specifically?

836
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:40,918
You specifically.

837
00:39:42,376 --> 00:39:43,376
Benji.

838
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,668
- Yo.
- Yo!

839
00:39:47,043 --> 00:39:48,960
I was thinking about what you said...

840
00:39:49,835 --> 00:39:52,168
on the train about understanding suffering.

841
00:39:53,293 --> 00:39:55,168
It really stirred me.

842
00:39:55,335 --> 00:39:57,085
Yo, seriously, Marcia?

843
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:58,960
- Yeah.
- Dope.

844
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:02,710
Last year,
my daughter married a very rich man.

845
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:03,960
Fuck.

846
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:07,251
And she's incapable of having a conversation
with any depth anymore.

847
00:40:07,418 --> 00:40:10,751
Well, yeah, of course. Money is like
fucking heroin for boring people.

848
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:12,793
Well, I don't know what that means...

849
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,543
but it's just so easy
to float through life...

850
00:40:17,168 --> 00:40:19,001
forgetting how lucky we are.

851
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:21,418
Guys, I'm eavesdropping. Is that okay?

852
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,543
'Course, Eloge, come on in.

853
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,251
I want to echo what Marcia was saying
if that's all right?

854
00:40:26,418 --> 00:40:28,001
- Really? Really?
- Of course.

855
00:40:28,168 --> 00:40:31,918
I find myself constantly baffled
by the way the world seems to carry on...

856
00:40:32,085 --> 00:40:34,418
like there aren't a million reasons
to be shocked.

857
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:36,835
- To be... appalled.
- Exactly.

858
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,626
Yeah. Fuckin' A.
That's exactly what I'm saying, man.

859
00:40:38,793 --> 00:40:41,043
I don't know. I mean, if, like,
we wept for every sad thing in the world...

860
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,210
like, what would that accomplish?

861
00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:43,376
I don't know.

862
00:40:43,543 --> 00:40:45,126
Maybe sad shit wouldn't constantly happen.

863
00:40:45,293 --> 00:40:46,293
Exactly.

864
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:50,876
David, we numb ourselves
to avoid thinking about our impact.

865
00:40:51,043 --> 00:40:54,585
Ignoring the proverbial slaughterhouse
to enjoy the steak, as it were.

866
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:55,960
Yes, Eloge. Damn, that's a good analogy.

867
00:40:56,126 --> 00:40:58,543
No. And I get that. I get all that.
It just seems like maybe there's, like...

868
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,335
a time and a place to grieve,
and maybe it's not...

869
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:01,501
- Yo, Dave.
- What?

870
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,001
We're on a fucking Holocaust tour.

871
00:41:03,168 --> 00:41:06,251
If now is not the time and place
to grieve, to open up...

872
00:41:06,751 --> 00:41:08,085
I don't know what to tell you, man.

873
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:12,376
Come on, then, you lot. Stragglers.

874
00:41:13,793 --> 00:41:15,251
So, here we are...

875
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:17,460
at the famous Grodzka Gate...

876
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:20,335
or, as it was once called, the Jewish Gate.

877
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:24,751
On the other side of this threshold
was the Jewish Quarter, okay?

878
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:26,293
Now, as we pass through...

879
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,001
I want you to try to imagine
what life was like hundreds of years ago.

880
00:41:30,168 --> 00:41:33,376
Try to avoid conjuring images
of the horrors to come...

881
00:41:33,543 --> 00:41:36,210
and just picture a vibrant city.

882
00:41:42,418 --> 00:41:44,710
<i>The memories of Jewish life are here.</i>

883
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:48,251
<i>But they're hidden around the city.</i>

884
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:52,501
<i>And the oldest surviving synagogue
is on the second floor of an office building.</i>

885
00:41:54,293 --> 00:41:57,168
<i>But there are little pieces
of history frozen.</i>

886
00:41:57,835 --> 00:41:59,918
<i>Peeking out, waiting for us.</i>

887
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,210
<i>A former Yiddish theater.</i>

888
00:42:05,085 --> 00:42:06,251
<i>A yeshiva.</i>

889
00:42:07,835 --> 00:42:09,585
<i>A Jewish-owned brewery.</i>

890
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:12,793
<i>The Tarbut Hebrew School.</i>

891
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:16,210
<i>The Community Council of Lublin.</i>

892
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:18,918
<i>A tailor.</i>

893
00:42:19,876 --> 00:42:21,335
<i>A dry goods store.</i>

894
00:42:22,418 --> 00:42:23,626
<i>A bakery.</i>

895
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:25,876
<i>A bookseller.</i>

896
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:28,585
<i>A textile shop.</i>

897
00:42:45,335 --> 00:42:47,710
So, there's some discrepancy
about the founding of the cemetery...

898
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:50,585
- but most people have it pegged at 1541.
- Wow.

899
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,585
- Can you imagine?
- No.

900
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:53,335
That's before the founding
of the United States.

901
00:42:53,918 --> 00:42:55,793
That's before, I don't know, Shakespeare.

902
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,335
And the oldest headstone in the whole
of Poland is actually located right here...

903
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:01,876
- in the cemetery.
- Yes. Kopelman.

904
00:43:02,043 --> 00:43:03,543
Yes, Eloge. How'd you know that?

905
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,085
I read about it this morning.
Don't be too impressed.

906
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,293
- What?
- Ding, ding. Right again, Eloge.

907
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,543
- What's your problem now?
- Jacob Kopelman Levi. 1541.

908
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,626
Who cares?

909
00:43:11,793 --> 00:43:13,335
It's quite unassuming, isn't it,
if you don't know what you're looking at?

910
00:43:13,501 --> 00:43:15,085
- Benji, what the fuck?
- It's just...

911
00:43:15,251 --> 00:43:17,793
It's hard to know
whether the Jewish community was drawn to...

912
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,126
- Lublin because of these local virtues or...
- Benji? Benji?

913
00:43:20,293 --> 00:43:21,793
- Yo, James?
- Shit. Benji?

914
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,210
- Hey, James. Hey, man.
- Benji, Benji, Benji.

915
00:43:23,376 --> 00:43:24,376
- You all right, Benji?
- Hey, look, man...

916
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,501
you're, like, completely knowledgeable
about this shit.

917
00:43:27,668 --> 00:43:29,960
And it's fuckin'... It's impressive, man.

918
00:43:30,126 --> 00:43:32,751
And we all know that now and everything.
But, like...

919
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:34,793
Like, these are real people, James, you know?

920
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,126
They're not your little factoids
lying under here, okay?

921
00:43:37,293 --> 00:43:38,293
They're not history lessons.

922
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,501
- Benji, Benji, okay.
- Just... Hey, maybe like take a seat.

923
00:43:40,668 --> 00:43:42,585
- Text your wife. Have a sit for a second.
- Sorry if I said something to upset you or...

924
00:43:42,751 --> 00:43:44,960
No. No, no, no. Look, look. You know
your shit. Don't get me wrong.

925
00:43:45,126 --> 00:43:47,376
And, Eloge, you, like, totally
know your shit, but I think it's just...

926
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:49,126
the constant barrage of stats.

927
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,876
It's making this whole thing feel very...

928
00:43:51,626 --> 00:43:52,626
cold, you know?

929
00:43:55,626 --> 00:43:56,626
Okay.

930
00:43:57,418 --> 00:44:00,960
I'm sorry. Maybe it's just my British tone
or something.

931
00:44:01,126 --> 00:44:02,501
I'm just trying to be honest.

932
00:44:02,668 --> 00:44:04,418
If it helps to have feedback,
that's what I'm doing.

933
00:44:04,585 --> 00:44:07,251
- I think a major problem with your tour...
- Okay.

934
00:44:07,418 --> 00:44:08,793
- Oh, my God.
- If I can just... This is okay?

935
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,126
- This is a free space?
- Okay.

936
00:44:11,626 --> 00:44:13,251
I just think we've been,
like, completely cut off...

937
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:16,751
from anything that's like,
fucking, like, real, you know?

938
00:44:17,543 --> 00:44:19,335
- It's all real, Benji.
- Is it?

939
00:44:19,501 --> 00:44:21,085
I've only said real things.
I've only said real things.

940
00:44:21,251 --> 00:44:23,418
It's real? Then how come I haven't met
anyone that's actually Polish?

941
00:44:23,585 --> 00:44:25,960
I haven't had any interaction with somebody
who's, like, from here.

942
00:44:26,126 --> 00:44:27,126
- You know what I mean?
- Benji, come on.

943
00:44:27,293 --> 00:44:29,960
We've just been going from one touristy thing
to another touristy thing, you know?

944
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,918
Yeah, no, but that sort of is what a tour is,
though, isn't it?

945
00:44:33,085 --> 00:44:34,210
Going from one touristy thing to another.

946
00:44:34,376 --> 00:44:36,210
That's kind of what you signed up for,
isn't it?

947
00:44:36,376 --> 00:44:37,876
Well, Dave signed up for the tour.

948
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,960
All right. Yeah, no. I mean, I'm sorry.

949
00:44:41,793 --> 00:44:43,626
Look, man. And you know what?

950
00:44:43,793 --> 00:44:46,751
Honestly, it's like a mostly amazing tour.

951
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:48,793
I mean it, man.
Like I'm fuckin'... I'm lovin' it.

952
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,960
It's totally Dave's speed.

953
00:44:50,126 --> 00:44:53,960
But just, like, chill on the facts
and figures for just a little bit.

954
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:55,626
I mean, would that be cool?

955
00:44:57,376 --> 00:45:00,418
- No. Yeah, 'course. Yeah. Let's tone it down.
- Great.

956
00:45:00,585 --> 00:45:02,751
Cool, that's all. That's all I'm asking.

957
00:45:05,293 --> 00:45:08,168
Well, what I was gonna suggest was
we could put a rock on...

958
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,918
Kopelman's headstone.

959
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,710
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

960
00:45:14,876 --> 00:45:16,376
- Fuckin' love that idea.
- No, I think that's a good idea.

961
00:45:16,543 --> 00:45:17,751
Thanks, man.

962
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:18,918
So can I call them over?

963
00:45:19,085 --> 00:45:20,043
Do whatever you want, man.
It's your tour, James.

964
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,418
Okay, if everybody could just
come over here for a moment?

965
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:23,793
- Everybody? Marcia?
- Everyone look for stones.

966
00:45:24,835 --> 00:45:28,043
- Here we go. Look, here's one.
- Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

967
00:45:28,918 --> 00:45:31,126
If I can just very quickly...

968
00:45:31,293 --> 00:45:35,293
This is the oldest tombstone
in all of Poland.

969
00:45:35,918 --> 00:45:39,626
And it belongs to a man
called Jacob Kopelman Levi...

970
00:45:39,793 --> 00:45:43,210
who was a real human person who lived...

971
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:46,418
in the real world.
He was Polish.

972
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:49,501
From Poland.

973
00:45:49,668 --> 00:45:53,001
And Benji and I were just discussing
what might be nice to do...

974
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:56,668
and we thought maybe we could
all put a stone on his grave.

975
00:45:57,543 --> 00:46:00,126
Various theories about this Jewish tradition.

976
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:03,251
But personally, I like to think it's just...

977
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:07,251
a simple warm gesture to say...

978
00:46:08,293 --> 00:46:09,585
"You're not forgotten."

979
00:46:12,668 --> 00:46:14,335
That was beautiful, James.
Thank you.

980
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:18,835
Okay. So, let's do that, shall we?
Everyone?

981
00:46:19,168 --> 00:46:20,501
- Should we try and find some nice stones?
- Yeah. Yes.

982
00:46:20,668 --> 00:46:21,751
- Yeah, that was great.
- Good idea.

983
00:46:21,918 --> 00:46:23,001
- Yeah.
- I'll go look for a stone.

984
00:46:23,168 --> 00:46:26,376
- Great, great.
- I think that was a very lovely idea, Benji.

985
00:46:26,543 --> 00:46:28,168
- Thanks, Marcia. Thank you.
- Yeah. It was nice.

986
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:29,960
Yeah, we sorta cooked it up.

987
00:46:30,126 --> 00:46:31,585
- Let's find it.
- Stone hunt.

988
00:46:31,751 --> 00:46:33,793
I'm gonna have the biggest stones.

989
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:36,751
I want, like, a nice flat one, that's like...

990
00:46:37,126 --> 00:46:38,085
- Sorry.
- Here we go.

991
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:39,460
- It's fine.
- Hey, Marcia.

992
00:46:39,626 --> 00:46:40,501
Yeah.

993
00:46:41,126 --> 00:46:43,043
Okay. We all good with our stones?

994
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:44,710
I'd like this one, please.

995
00:47:19,751 --> 00:47:23,168
My dad was everyone's favorite,
but my dad's brother...

996
00:47:23,335 --> 00:47:25,001
- was the real brains of the family.
- Yeah.

997
00:47:25,168 --> 00:47:28,085
He got rejected from medical school
because of quotas...

998
00:47:28,251 --> 00:47:29,793
- you know, with Jewish doctors.
- Right.

999
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,043
And he... I'm sorry.

1000
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:34,126
I'm just having a little trouble
competing with <i>Hava Nagila.</i>

1001
00:47:34,293 --> 00:47:35,335
- I'm so sorry. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1002
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:36,751
We come here every tour...

1003
00:47:36,918 --> 00:47:38,126
and the food is wonderful...

1004
00:47:38,293 --> 00:47:40,418
but the music can be
a little bit kitschy, so...

1005
00:47:40,585 --> 00:47:41,793
Anti-Semitic pricks.

1006
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,460
Well, I don't know about anti-Semitic,
like, the owners are Jewish, but...

1007
00:47:46,085 --> 00:47:48,168
Sorry. Please continue, Marcia.

1008
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:52,001
So my Uncle Sam
couldn't go to medical school...

1009
00:47:52,168 --> 00:47:53,751
so he became a pharmacist...

1010
00:47:53,918 --> 00:47:56,918
and he ended up owning five...
Five, yeah.

1011
00:47:57,085 --> 00:47:58,835
Five pharmacies
in and around the Chicago area.

1012
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,501
- Wow.
- Like, he started what we now...

1013
00:48:00,668 --> 00:48:02,668
- think of as, like, a modern-day drug store.
- Yeah.

1014
00:48:02,835 --> 00:48:04,085
- Yeah. Exactly.
- That's extraordinary.

1015
00:48:04,251 --> 00:48:05,543
You know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah. And now the song's over.

1016
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,710
Just as I'm done with my story,
which is my usual...

1017
00:48:07,876 --> 00:48:10,085
That just speaks of the whole
immigrant experience, don't you think?

1018
00:48:10,251 --> 00:48:12,710
- Exactly.
- I can attest to that, absolutely.

1019
00:48:12,876 --> 00:48:15,543
Mark's great uncle
came off the boat from Poland...

1020
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:18,293
landed in Galveston for some <i>fakakta</i> reason.

1021
00:48:18,835 --> 00:48:19,835
Jew in Texas.

1022
00:48:20,001 --> 00:48:23,043
And he made money by taking the furniture
the rich people threw out on the street...

1023
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:25,126
refurbishing it and reselling.

1024
00:48:25,293 --> 00:48:26,710
- Really?
- True story. Mm-hmm.

1025
00:48:26,876 --> 00:48:30,418
Apparently, he ended up selling some of it
back to the original owners.

1026
00:48:30,585 --> 00:48:31,585
- No, he did not. Is that true?
- Yes.

1027
00:48:31,751 --> 00:48:32,751
- Of course, he did.
- Great uncle.

1028
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:33,918
Brilliant. Yeah, that is brilliant.

1029
00:48:34,085 --> 00:48:35,793
Rich people are fucking idiots.

1030
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:40,168
Well, anyway, our grandmother. She was...

1031
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:41,501
Grandma Dory.

1032
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:45,875
Yeah. Our Grandmother Dory,
whose house we're seeing on Thursday...

1033
00:48:45,876 --> 00:48:48,376
was also just this, you know, amazing woman.

1034
00:48:48,543 --> 00:48:50,168
She was just like one of these, like...

1035
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,126
bygone realist types
that you don't see anymore.

1036
00:48:53,293 --> 00:48:55,626
You know, just like blunt and tough and...

1037
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:59,168
I mean, to be honest, I was like,
scared shitless my whole childhood of her.

1038
00:48:59,335 --> 00:49:00,335
I was never scared of her.

1039
00:49:00,501 --> 00:49:01,543
That is true. That is true.

1040
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,960
No. She and Benji had some,
like, special secret language.

1041
00:49:04,126 --> 00:49:06,418
They always said
exactly what was on their minds. Didn't you?

1042
00:49:06,585 --> 00:49:07,710
- Had no choice.
- Yeah.

1043
00:49:07,876 --> 00:49:09,710
And a similar story,
she survived the camps...

1044
00:49:09,876 --> 00:49:11,751
through, like, a thousand miracles...

1045
00:49:11,918 --> 00:49:14,376
and she made her way to New York,
and she wanted to design dresses.

1046
00:49:14,543 --> 00:49:18,043
But she couldn't afford fashion school,
so she got stuck working as a secretary.

1047
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:19,376
Yeah. And then she was like, "Fuck this."

1048
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:21,376
And she ended up
taking over the whole company.

1049
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:22,710
- Wow.
- Baller.

1050
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,835
Well, he's making it sound like
she led a junta or something. No.

1051
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:27,960
No, she was just...
No, she was super smart.

1052
00:49:28,126 --> 00:49:30,168
It was a small commercial real estate
company. It was not, you know...

1053
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:31,585
I used to speak to her every Thursday.

1054
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:32,668
- Aw.
- Yeah.

1055
00:49:32,835 --> 00:49:34,543
- Literally every Thursday.
- That is so nice, Benji.

1056
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:38,085
If I hear from my kids once a month,
it's a shock.

1057
00:49:38,626 --> 00:49:39,751
Marcia. Fuck those guys.

1058
00:49:39,918 --> 00:49:41,668
Man, I wouldn't miss a week.

1059
00:49:42,376 --> 00:49:43,543
She was tough on me.

1060
00:49:44,001 --> 00:49:45,876
She was the only one
in the whole fuckin' family...

1061
00:49:46,043 --> 00:49:47,710
that would keep me honest.

1062
00:49:47,876 --> 00:49:50,418
You know, everyone else just disappeared
when I needed them most.

1063
00:49:52,585 --> 00:49:55,793
Yeah. But, you know,
Grandma never pitied herself.

1064
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,460
In fact, she always told me
she was grateful for her struggle.

1065
00:49:58,626 --> 00:49:59,626
Well, that's just it.

1066
00:49:59,793 --> 00:50:02,501
What she endured, that gave her hope, right?

1067
00:50:02,668 --> 00:50:04,376
Yes. In fact,
she used to tell me that, like...

1068
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,668
you know, first-generation immigrants
work some, like, menial job.

1069
00:50:07,835 --> 00:50:09,918
You know, they drive cabs, they deliver food.

1070
00:50:10,085 --> 00:50:11,668
Second generation, they go to good schools...

1071
00:50:11,835 --> 00:50:14,001
and they become like, you know,
a doctor or lawyer or whatever.

1072
00:50:14,168 --> 00:50:17,126
And the third generation
lives in their mother's basement...

1073
00:50:17,293 --> 00:50:18,585
and smokes pot all day.

1074
00:50:19,168 --> 00:50:20,293
I mean...

1075
00:50:21,668 --> 00:50:22,835
She said that?

1076
00:50:25,668 --> 00:50:28,168
I think she was like, just speaking generally
about, like, the immigrant experience.

1077
00:50:28,335 --> 00:50:29,918
Because I lived in my mom's basement.

1078
00:50:30,085 --> 00:50:31,251
- She was just talking about immigrants.
- Okay.

1079
00:50:31,418 --> 00:50:32,293
- That's all.
- Yeah.

1080
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,168
I gotsta pee.

1081
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,126
Oh, yeah.

1082
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,001
When I go to the bathroom, I'll get that.
Don't worry.

1083
00:50:50,626 --> 00:50:51,751
Pee-pee time.

1084
00:50:57,376 --> 00:50:58,543
I'm sorry about him.

1085
00:50:59,251 --> 00:51:00,251
No, no.

1086
00:51:00,835 --> 00:51:02,168
What a troubled young man.

1087
00:51:02,335 --> 00:51:04,210
He wants to be good. You can see the spark.

1088
00:51:04,376 --> 00:51:05,543
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah. Absolutely, Eloge.

1089
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:07,793
Forgive me if I don't see
this magical spark.

1090
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,126
Mark, stop it.
He's tormented for whatever reason.

1091
00:51:10,293 --> 00:51:11,293
- Okay. Okay.
- He's funny...

1092
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,960
and he's charming under all the <i>mishegoss.</i>

1093
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,251
I feel bad for him.

1094
00:51:15,418 --> 00:51:17,126
- Has he always been like this?
- Yeah.

1095
00:51:17,293 --> 00:51:18,793
I mean, he's always been,
like, up and down, you know?

1096
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,876
Like, he's sensitive and he, like,
sees people so clearly, you know?

1097
00:51:22,043 --> 00:51:24,710
But then you say the wrong thing
and, like, something switches.

1098
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:26,460
Maybe it's not appropriate to talk about him.

1099
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:28,126
No. What's not appropriate?

1100
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:31,376
You obviously got something going on
between you and...

1101
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:33,793
Well, he's clearly in pain.

1102
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,835
Yeah, but isn't everyone in pain in some way?

1103
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:38,418
I mean,
look at what happened to our families.

1104
00:51:38,585 --> 00:51:39,835
Look at where we came from.

1105
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:42,001
I mean, who isn't...
You know, who isn't wrought?

1106
00:51:42,168 --> 00:51:44,418
- Well, you seem okay.
- I'm not, though. I'm not.

1107
00:51:44,585 --> 00:51:47,043
I just, like, take a pill
for my fucking OCD, you know...

1108
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:50,585
and I jog and I meditate,
and I go to work in the morning.

1109
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:53,376
I, like, come home at the end of the day,
and I, like, move forward, you know...

1110
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:55,001
because I know
that my pain is unexceptional...

1111
00:51:55,168 --> 00:51:56,626
so I don't feel the need to, like...

1112
00:51:56,793 --> 00:51:58,335
I don't know,
burden everybody with it, you know?

1113
00:51:58,501 --> 00:51:59,626
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1114
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:01,918
Yeah. God, I'm sorry.

1115
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:03,085
No. It's all right, David.

1116
00:52:03,251 --> 00:52:05,585
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry. I'm ranting. I'm just, like...

1117
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:09,335
I don't know.

1118
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:16,293
Sorry. I'm just, like, so fucking exhausted
by him sometimes, you know, like I...

1119
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,876
I love him...

1120
00:52:19,043 --> 00:52:20,376
and I hate him...

1121
00:52:20,543 --> 00:52:23,043
and I want to kill him.

1122
00:52:24,251 --> 00:52:26,626
And I want to be him, you know?

1123
00:52:26,793 --> 00:52:28,210
And I feel, like...

1124
00:52:28,585 --> 00:52:30,751
so stupid around him, you know...

1125
00:52:30,918 --> 00:52:33,376
because he is so fucking cool,
and he just does not give a shit.

1126
00:52:33,543 --> 00:52:34,543
And then...

1127
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:39,085
just, like, being here with him
is just so fucking baffling to me, you know?

1128
00:52:39,251 --> 00:52:41,460
It's just baffling 'cause it's, like...

1129
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:46,418
how did this guy come
from the survivors of this place, you know?

1130
00:52:46,585 --> 00:52:49,793
I mean that your uncle had to sell,
like, used furniture to rich assholes...

1131
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,376
or, like, couldn't get into medical school...

1132
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,001
And that you survived, like...

1133
00:52:53,168 --> 00:52:56,251
the worst thing to happen on this planet
in the last 30 years.

1134
00:52:56,418 --> 00:52:59,751
And that our grandma survived
by a thousand miracles...

1135
00:52:59,918 --> 00:53:02,376
when the entire world was trying to kill her,
you know?

1136
00:53:02,543 --> 00:53:04,876
And I look at him...

1137
00:53:05,418 --> 00:53:07,960
and I just, like, wanna ask him...

1138
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:12,001
I just wanna ask him, and I just can't.

1139
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:17,460
Like, how did the product
of a thousand fucking miracles...

1140
00:53:17,626 --> 00:53:20,543
overdose on a bottle of sleeping pills?

1141
00:53:22,585 --> 00:53:23,585
What?

1142
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:25,460
What did you say?

1143
00:53:25,626 --> 00:53:26,918
Yeah, he tried to...

1144
00:53:28,418 --> 00:53:30,710
Yeah. Sorry.
I probably shouldn't have said anything.

1145
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:35,793
It's okay. I'm sorry to hear that.

1146
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,251
I'm so sorry. That's very distressing.

1147
00:53:38,418 --> 00:53:39,543
When did this happen?

1148
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:41,668
Like, six months ago.

1149
00:53:42,501 --> 00:53:45,293
My Aunt Leah, Benji's mom,
found him on the couch.

1150
00:53:47,376 --> 00:53:50,626
And I know he is so funny and so charming.

1151
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:54,918
And you are all gonna walk away
with this picture of this amazing man...

1152
00:53:55,085 --> 00:53:57,293
which he totally is in so many ways.

1153
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,918
But when I picture him...

1154
00:54:00,918 --> 00:54:04,293
it is passed out on a ratty basement couch...

1155
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,626
while I am in New York City
with my beautiful wife and adorable child...

1156
00:54:07,793 --> 00:54:09,668
and it just fucking kills me.

1157
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:15,626
Sorry. I'm oversharing.

1158
00:54:23,918 --> 00:54:25,335
Well, they're back again.

1159
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:27,710
It's him.

1160
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,460
Did you know he plays the piano?

1161
00:54:41,376 --> 00:54:43,210
We used to take lessons together.

1162
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:48,585
Excuse me.

1163
00:55:24,043 --> 00:55:25,293
<i>Aw, that's so nice, Benji.</i>

1164
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,210
<i>That was wonderful, Benji.</i>

1165
00:56:22,543 --> 00:56:24,251
Fuck.

1166
00:56:32,668 --> 00:56:34,876
Hi. Sorry to bother you.

1167
00:56:35,043 --> 00:56:38,835
Did you happen to see, like,
my cousin come through or anything?

1168
00:56:39,001 --> 00:56:40,001
He's, like...

1169
00:56:44,626 --> 00:56:47,293
<i>Have been forwarded to
an automated voice messaging system.</i>

1170
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,543
<i>Boner.</i>

1171
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:50,085
<i>Is not available.</i>

1172
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:53,251
<i>The mailbox is full and cannot accept
any messages at this time.</i>

1173
00:56:53,418 --> 00:56:54,418
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1174
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:06,918
- Hello?
<i>- Dude, where the fuck are ya?</i>

1175
00:57:07,085 --> 00:57:08,210
<i>We're all downstairs waiting for you, man.</i>

1176
00:57:08,376 --> 00:57:09,376
Oh, shit.

1177
00:57:09,543 --> 00:57:10,668
<i>- Get your ass down here.</i>
- Fuck.

1178
00:57:23,418 --> 00:57:25,793
Ah, there he is. Mornin', Dave.

1179
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,501
You sleep through your alarm or somethin'?

1180
00:57:27,668 --> 00:57:29,793
No. My phone died
because I didn't plug it in...

1181
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,085
because I spent the night looking for you.
Where the fuck were you?

1182
00:57:32,251 --> 00:57:35,251
Oh. Sorry, dude. Yeah. You were fast asleep.

1183
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:37,210
Yeah?
Well, you scared the shit out of me, Benji.

1184
00:57:37,376 --> 00:57:39,001
Oh. Sorry, man.

1185
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:40,793
Yeah, I was just kicking it with Marcia.
Didn't wanna wake you.

1186
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,876
- Good morning, gang.
- Mornin'.

1187
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,210
- You're all down so early. I love that.
- Morning.

1188
00:57:44,376 --> 00:57:45,376
Good morning.

1189
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:47,543
Well, the van should be here.

1190
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:51,626
It's gonna be an eerily short drive. Okay?

1191
00:58:01,043 --> 00:58:04,043
Whatever. Yeah.
I think I was feeling okay until...

1192
00:58:05,668 --> 00:58:06,751
I don't like...

1193
00:58:06,918 --> 00:58:10,251
Okay. So, if I could just
get everyone's attention just for a moment.

1194
00:58:11,251 --> 00:58:12,251
- James.
- I don't wanna state the obvious...

1195
00:58:12,418 --> 00:58:14,293
but today is gonna be quite a taxing day.

1196
00:58:14,835 --> 00:58:17,460
If you've never been to
a concentration camp before...

1197
00:58:17,626 --> 00:58:19,626
it can be pretty overwhelming.

1198
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:22,251
We'll be there in, like,
literally two minutes.

1199
00:58:22,418 --> 00:58:24,335
Okay? Thanks, everyone.

1200
00:58:46,418 --> 00:58:47,543
Everyone all right?

1201
00:58:49,251 --> 00:58:51,085
So, the first thing you might notice...

1202
00:58:51,251 --> 00:58:55,210
is that Majdanek is literally just
two miles from Lublin town square.

1203
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:59,585
Can you imagine life continuing on...

1204
00:58:59,751 --> 00:59:03,293
a bustling town center
just two miles from these grounds?

1205
00:59:08,043 --> 00:59:10,376
Before the Red Army got to Majdanek...

1206
00:59:10,543 --> 00:59:12,460
the Nazis had actually moved
most of their prisoners...

1207
00:59:12,626 --> 00:59:14,418
to other camps out west.

1208
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:17,168
And, in their haste,
the SS didn't destroy the evidence.

1209
00:59:17,335 --> 00:59:18,960
So, unlike other camps...

1210
00:59:19,126 --> 00:59:21,918
Majdanek is actually quite...

1211
00:59:22,085 --> 00:59:25,001
well-preserved, for lack of a better phrase.

1212
00:59:37,876 --> 00:59:39,376
So, before we head in...

1213
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:43,085
I might be a little bit sparser
with my information overload today.

1214
00:59:43,543 --> 00:59:47,293
This is a sacred site where
many thousands were murdered, and...

1215
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,501
I think you'll find this place
kinda speaks for itself.

1216
00:59:51,376 --> 00:59:52,376
Okay?

1217
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:02,710
Hey.

1218
01:00:03,918 --> 01:00:04,918
Hey.

1219
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,710
These are the barracks.

1220
01:00:21,126 --> 01:00:22,876
This is the men's bathhouse.

1221
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:37,251
"He grabbed his whip
and herded us towards the bathhouse.

1222
01:00:37,626 --> 01:00:41,918
"There, once our hair was cut and shaved
from our entire bodies...

1223
01:00:42,835 --> 01:00:44,043
"we went into the next room."

1224
01:01:06,293 --> 01:01:07,876
This is the gas chamber.

1225
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:32,626
The blue stains on the walls
are residue from the deadly gas...

1226
01:01:32,793 --> 01:01:33,960
Zyklon B.

1227
01:01:43,085 --> 01:01:44,085
The ovens.

1228
01:03:09,126 --> 01:03:10,668
Just hang here for a moment. Yeah?

1229
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:14,126
Okay.

1230
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,543
So, if we just gather here for just a moment.

1231
01:03:19,835 --> 01:03:21,460
How are we all feeling?

1232
01:03:22,126 --> 01:03:24,210
Mm. Not feeling so good.

1233
01:03:24,585 --> 01:03:26,460
Numb, maybe?

1234
01:03:26,626 --> 01:03:27,918
Yeah. That's about right.

1235
01:03:28,085 --> 01:03:30,626
Eloge, how are you doing? I know
you don't have the same advantage of...

1236
01:03:30,793 --> 01:03:32,710
distance, so to speak.

1237
01:03:33,501 --> 01:03:37,085
I'm okay. I feel shaken.

1238
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:38,876
But...

1239
01:03:39,043 --> 01:03:41,418
- I guess that's better than feeling nothing.
- Yeah.

1240
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:46,335
Well, thank you all for
sharing that with me and with each other.

1241
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:49,751
Don't wanna rush anyone, but obviously
we're leaving for Zamość quite soon.

1242
01:03:49,918 --> 01:03:51,168
So just to change gears...

1243
01:03:51,793 --> 01:03:53,001
we're losing the lads.

1244
01:03:53,168 --> 01:03:54,418
- Aw.
- Very sad. Yep.

1245
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:56,793
The boys are staying here for another night,
and then...

1246
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,418
finishing their pilgrimage
to see Grandma Dory's house.

1247
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:01,876
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. I'm...

1248
01:04:02,043 --> 01:04:05,835
I'm gonna miss all you guys.
Like a weird, fucked-up family.

1249
01:04:07,168 --> 01:04:08,793
- Can I just...
- Yeah.

1250
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,293
- Thanks, David.
- You are amazing.

1251
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:11,460
Thanks so much.

1252
01:04:11,626 --> 01:04:13,293
Send me a photograph
of your grandma's house.

1253
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:14,626
- I wanna see it, okay?
- Yeah. I'll do that.

1254
01:04:14,793 --> 01:04:15,793
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1255
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,918
- Have fun at Grandma's.
- Take care of yourself, honey.

1256
01:04:18,085 --> 01:04:19,585
You too. And take care of him...

1257
01:04:19,751 --> 01:04:20,585
- 'cause he won't.
- Okay.

1258
01:04:20,751 --> 01:04:21,751
No, no, no, that's fine.

1259
01:04:21,918 --> 01:04:23,335
- Take care of this guy.
- Right.

1260
01:04:23,501 --> 01:04:24,501
You're a good guy, Benji.

1261
01:04:24,668 --> 01:04:26,126
No. You are.

1262
01:04:26,293 --> 01:04:28,126
- Do you mean that? Really?
- Yes, I do.

1263
01:04:28,293 --> 01:04:29,251
- Thanks. Travel safe.
- Go in peace, my friend.

1264
01:04:29,418 --> 01:04:31,085
Oh, fuckin' A. That means a lot to me.

1265
01:04:31,251 --> 01:04:32,751
I'm gonna look up what that means.

1266
01:04:34,043 --> 01:04:37,793
- Take care. So good to do this.
- So, Benji, I just want to say...

1267
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,960
I've been doing this
for five and a half years.

1268
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,085
And I always say...

1269
01:04:41,251 --> 01:04:42,960
"Please, just let me know
if I can do anything better."

1270
01:04:43,126 --> 01:04:45,668
And you're the first person ever
to give me...

1271
01:04:45,835 --> 01:04:47,043
actionable feedback, so...

1272
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:49,293
- thank you so much for that, yeah.
- Get the fuck outta here. What did I say?

1273
01:04:50,251 --> 01:04:52,918
What are you talking about?
You know, the stuff about engaging with...

1274
01:04:53,085 --> 01:04:55,626
Polish people and the Polish culture and...

1275
01:04:55,793 --> 01:04:57,793
Oh, man, that sounds great.
You should fucking do that, man.

1276
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,710
I know. And I resisted it on the day...

1277
01:04:59,876 --> 01:05:01,460
but I can't stop thinking about it.

1278
01:05:01,626 --> 01:05:04,835
And you've really
reawakened something in me, so...

1279
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:07,418
- Get the fuck outta here, man.
- You're a very honest man...

1280
01:05:07,585 --> 01:05:09,793
- and that's rare. And I appreciate it, so...
- Yeah. Oh, shut up.

1281
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,376
- Come on. Like...
- Thanks so much. Thank you.

1282
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:13,710
Okay.

1283
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:15,960
Sorry.
I just wanted to get that off my chest.

1284
01:05:16,126 --> 01:05:17,126
Thanks, David.

1285
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:22,835
He's a nice guy.

1286
01:05:38,585 --> 01:05:39,626
- Did you?
- Yeah. Well, no.

1287
01:05:39,793 --> 01:05:41,126
I mean, that's absurd.

1288
01:05:41,293 --> 01:05:43,585
- Yeah. Yeah. What? What?
- Does this look good?

1289
01:05:43,751 --> 01:05:45,293
- What? Yeah. All right, let's go.
- How much is this?

1290
01:05:46,126 --> 01:05:47,126
You don't need to get the hat.

1291
01:05:47,293 --> 01:05:48,293
Do you want one too?

1292
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:49,585
No. You look like the Ricola man.

1293
01:05:49,751 --> 01:05:51,835
Do you want that? No, that's for you.

1294
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:53,210
You get to keep it.

1295
01:05:53,376 --> 01:05:54,668
- Yeah. I wouldn't know what to do with it.
- Okay. Benji.

1296
01:05:54,835 --> 01:05:57,543
Can we get something to eat that's, like,
not pickled?

1297
01:05:57,710 --> 01:05:59,251
- Pierogies?
- Anything that's not...

1298
01:05:59,418 --> 01:06:01,251
- pierogies and not pickled.
- Sauerkraut?

1299
01:06:01,418 --> 01:06:03,626
Sauerkraut is... it's pickled and German.

1300
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,960
...to go and grab kids' heads in the audience
and lick it.

1301
01:06:06,126 --> 01:06:08,085
- God, that's so gross.
- Yeah! The Bushwhacker! And it's...

1302
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:11,543
Yes. I remember that. Yeah.

1303
01:06:12,043 --> 01:06:13,043
Hey, doggie.

1304
01:06:16,418 --> 01:06:17,251
Yo, can I have a swig?

1305
01:06:17,418 --> 01:06:20,418
Oh, yeah. Have as much as you want.
We got the cheap shit.

1306
01:06:23,251 --> 01:06:24,710
- All right. Check out this building.
- Yeah.

1307
01:06:25,376 --> 01:06:27,460
Pretty tall. I got one last joint.

1308
01:06:28,043 --> 01:06:29,585
How are we gonna get up?

1309
01:06:31,501 --> 01:06:32,418
Shall we?

1310
01:06:40,418 --> 01:06:41,418
Blork.

1311
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:53,710
Mm. Mm-hmm.

1312
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:05,085
- All right.
- Yeah. Not bad. Not bad.

1313
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,001
Shit. You know what I think that is?

1314
01:07:08,168 --> 01:07:09,168
Hmm. What?

1315
01:07:09,335 --> 01:07:10,918
Look way down there.
You see those, like, three lights?

1316
01:07:11,085 --> 01:07:12,126
- What?
- One, two, three.

1317
01:07:12,293 --> 01:07:13,376
- Oh, shit.
- I think it's the camp.

1318
01:07:13,543 --> 01:07:14,960
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1319
01:07:15,126 --> 01:07:16,376
Really is so close.

1320
01:07:20,543 --> 01:07:22,126
Yeah, so, what are you thinkin' of doing...

1321
01:07:22,293 --> 01:07:23,626
when you get back to Binghamton?

1322
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,376
What do you mean?

1323
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:28,126
I mean, like, what's...
Like, what's your plan?

1324
01:07:29,835 --> 01:07:31,876
Dude, give me that
if you're just gonna fucking stare at it.

1325
01:07:32,043 --> 01:07:33,126
- Oh, sorry.
- It's my last one.

1326
01:07:33,293 --> 01:07:34,293
- Sorry, man.
- All right.

1327
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:35,460
Sorry about that.

1328
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:37,918
Yeah, well, when I get back,
it's gonna be pretty busy.

1329
01:07:38,085 --> 01:07:39,085
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1330
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:40,293
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

1331
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:42,001
My buddy, Tim, is re-roofing his house,

1332
01:07:42,168 --> 01:07:43,543
and I'm probably gonna
help him out with that.

1333
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:45,085
He's got a shit ton of adobe.

1334
01:07:45,251 --> 01:07:46,751
Has no idea what the fuck he's doing.

1335
01:07:46,918 --> 01:07:47,918
- Really?
- Yeah.

1336
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:50,210
- Gonna be good, though.
- Yeah.

1337
01:07:50,376 --> 01:07:51,835
Be pretty sweet when he's finished.
You know?

1338
01:07:53,835 --> 01:07:55,043
Keeps moisture out better than that...

1339
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:56,918
plastic toxic shit they use on all those...

1340
01:07:57,085 --> 01:07:59,251
- bullshit suburban houses, you know?
- Oh, yeah. That's awesome.

1341
01:07:59,418 --> 01:08:01,043
Yeah. It's gonna be pretty rad.

1342
01:08:03,251 --> 01:08:05,376
Well, that's, like, Tim's house.

1343
01:08:06,501 --> 01:08:07,751
- So?
- So...

1344
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:09,710
what are you gonna do?

1345
01:08:10,335 --> 01:08:11,710
Oh, man. Why the fuck you asking me that?

1346
01:08:11,876 --> 01:08:14,168
I wanna make sure you're good
and that you have, like, a plan.

1347
01:08:15,668 --> 01:08:17,375
- Sorry. Maybe I'm a little stoned. I'm sorry.
- Yeah. No. Mm-mm.

1348
01:08:17,543 --> 01:08:18,543
- Here, take this.
- No. It's all right.

1349
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:20,625
- I can't be trusted.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1350
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,668
And, like,
what are you gonna do when you go home?

1351
01:08:26,375 --> 01:08:28,043
I don't know. Go back to, like...

1352
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:30,210
my job and my family, the usual.

1353
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:32,418
Great. I look forward to
speaking to you in six months.

1354
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:34,750
What does that mean?

1355
01:08:34,918 --> 01:08:35,918
- You know what it means, man.
- Do I?

1356
01:08:36,085 --> 01:08:37,210
I don't really wanna start anything.

1357
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:38,375
Okay, good. Then don't.

1358
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:44,293
You used to be fucking different, man.
You used to be so emotional.

1359
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:46,460
You used to fucking
cry about everything, man. Like...

1360
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:49,418
Yeah, I know. It was awful.
Who the fuck wants to cry about everything?

1361
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:51,335
Dave, man,
you're not fucking listenin' to me, man.

1362
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,085
I'm saying that we used to be...

1363
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,460
- different. Like, "we."
- Yeah. Benji, I have, like...

1364
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:56,500
- a job and a family.
- Mm. I know.

1365
01:08:56,668 --> 01:08:58,710
And I don't have time to
hang out with you all night...

1366
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:00,335
- every night, okay?
- I don't fucking want that.

1367
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,585
Yes, you do.
You're, like, an all-encompassing person.

1368
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:04,085
- I don't think you realize that.
- Man, I'm just saying, like, you, like...

1369
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,793
- I don't think you realize that.
- Man, you, like, literally never visit me.

1370
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,710
What in... Sorry, you mean in Binghamton?

1371
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:09,875
Yeah, man, that's where I live.

1372
01:09:10,043 --> 01:09:12,043
Well, yeah, I'm busy, okay?
And I live in New York City.

1373
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:13,460
Isn't it easier for you to come down to me?

1374
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:15,460
Easier? It's the same fucking distance, Dave.

1375
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:16,668
Yeah, but it's New York City, man.

1376
01:09:16,835 --> 01:09:19,125
It's, like, the more logical place to visit
than fucking Binghamton...

1377
01:09:19,293 --> 01:09:20,293
- all due respect.
- What's wrong with Binghamton?

1378
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:21,460
Nothing is wrong with Binghamton.

1379
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:23,085
You are, like, purposefully making me
look like an asshole...

1380
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:24,375
- for questioning it.
- Mm. Yo, fuck off, dude.

1381
01:09:24,543 --> 01:09:25,375
Yo, you fuck off.

1382
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:27,918
Why don't you give a shit about me anymore?

1383
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:30,000
I do give a shit about you.

1384
01:09:30,335 --> 01:09:32,043
I just don't understand...

1385
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:35,710
how you would ever do anything
so fucking stupid to yourself.

1386
01:09:36,168 --> 01:09:37,500
Dave, man.

1387
01:09:37,668 --> 01:09:38,668
Benji.

1388
01:09:41,585 --> 01:09:43,085
I, like, I walk around with, like, this...

1389
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,793
terrible fucking image of you
in my head, okay?

1390
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,835
And, yeah, I don't...

1391
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,918
Yeah, I don't wanna lose you, okay?

1392
01:09:51,293 --> 01:09:53,460
Do you see how people love you?

1393
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:57,460
Do you see what happens
when you walk into a room?

1394
01:10:00,376 --> 01:10:04,293
I would give anything
to know what that feels like... man.

1395
01:10:07,543 --> 01:10:10,876
To know what it feels like to have charm.

1396
01:10:12,376 --> 01:10:14,043
To light up a room when I walk in.

1397
01:10:16,543 --> 01:10:19,585
But you light up a room and then you, like,
shit on everything inside of it.

1398
01:11:06,251 --> 01:11:07,376
All right. You can go.

1399
01:11:07,668 --> 01:11:08,668
Thanks.

1400
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,126
Taxi's here.

1401
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:11,793
Let me see.

1402
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:15,751
See a 25 anywhere?

1403
01:12:15,918 --> 01:12:18,501
No, I don't see any numbers anywhere. Wait.

1404
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:19,668
Me neither.

1405
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:22,168
Okay, wait.
I think it should be around this way.

1406
01:12:23,626 --> 01:12:26,751
"Mag-is-trate." What do you think that means?

1407
01:12:26,918 --> 01:12:28,585
- Probably magistrate.
- Oh.

1408
01:12:29,001 --> 01:12:30,001
I think so.

1409
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:33,085
Is this like a real street or...

1410
01:12:33,835 --> 01:12:35,293
Twenty-eight.

1411
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:37,668
I think it's this.

1412
01:12:38,751 --> 01:12:40,668
- Here?
- Yeah.

1413
01:12:55,251 --> 01:12:56,251
Twenty-five.

1414
01:12:58,710 --> 01:12:59,710
Oh, my God.

1415
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:03,293
Whoa. Is that possible?

1416
01:13:05,835 --> 01:13:08,876
It's so... unremarkable.

1417
01:13:09,043 --> 01:13:11,835
Yeah. I guess I don't know what I pictured.

1418
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:13,751
Yeah. Me neither.

1419
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:27,585
You know she slapped me once, right?

1420
01:13:28,585 --> 01:13:29,585
What?

1421
01:13:29,751 --> 01:13:31,585
Yeah. Grandma slapped me.

1422
01:13:31,751 --> 01:13:33,376
- Shit. Really?
- Yeah.

1423
01:13:33,543 --> 01:13:35,460
I was late to meet her for dinner.

1424
01:13:35,626 --> 01:13:37,501
- Just, like, 15 minutes.
- Yeah.

1425
01:13:37,668 --> 01:13:40,751
Also, I was pretty high. It was at that
Hudson restaurant on Third Avenue.

1426
01:13:40,918 --> 01:13:42,501
You know, in the purgatory of Murray Hill.

1427
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,168
Yes, I know it. Shit. Did it hurt?

1428
01:13:44,335 --> 01:13:45,835
- The fuck, yeah, it hurt. Yeah.
- Wow.

1429
01:13:46,001 --> 01:13:47,751
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1430
01:13:48,501 --> 01:13:49,460
I was, like...

1431
01:13:49,626 --> 01:13:52,043
elated for a full 24 hours after that.

1432
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:54,335
- Really? Why?
- I don't know why.

1433
01:13:54,501 --> 01:13:56,460
I mean, it was at this fucking restaurant...

1434
01:13:56,626 --> 01:13:58,835
she went to every week.
Everyone knew her there.

1435
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:02,126
She dressed up all formal for it like
it was some big fucking occasion, and...

1436
01:14:02,293 --> 01:14:03,751
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

1437
01:14:03,918 --> 01:14:05,126
I guess the fact that
she cared more about me...

1438
01:14:05,293 --> 01:14:07,835
than what the people
at the restaurant thought?

1439
01:14:08,001 --> 01:14:09,168
I don't know.

1440
01:14:09,335 --> 01:14:10,668
Made me feel good.

1441
01:14:12,543 --> 01:14:13,501
Hey.

1442
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:15,793
I got an idea.

1443
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:16,918
What?

1444
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:18,501
Let's put a stone on the stoop.

1445
01:14:19,168 --> 01:14:20,001
What do you mean?

1446
01:14:20,168 --> 01:14:21,835
I mean, let's find a little stone...

1447
01:14:22,001 --> 01:14:23,793
and put it on the stoop
to say that we were here.

1448
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,626
That she's not, you know, forgotten.

1449
01:14:25,793 --> 01:14:27,918
- She's not buried here.
- Yeah, I know.

1450
01:14:28,085 --> 01:14:30,251
But this is the last place she was in Poland.

1451
01:14:30,418 --> 01:14:31,960
It's the last place any of us were.

1452
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:35,710
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Okay.

1453
01:14:35,876 --> 01:14:37,085
- It's a good idea.
- Okay.

1454
01:14:38,751 --> 01:14:40,168
Yeah. Not this. No.

1455
01:14:40,335 --> 01:14:41,168
No, no.

1456
01:14:43,001 --> 01:14:44,543
- One, two.
- Yeah?

1457
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:45,751
Yeah, I found two.

1458
01:14:45,918 --> 01:14:47,335
- Do you want one?
- Yeah.

1459
01:14:47,501 --> 01:14:48,501
Thanks.

1460
01:14:49,376 --> 01:14:50,210
Yeah.

1461
01:15:09,876 --> 01:15:12,335
Hi. Sorry, we're Americans.

1462
01:15:12,501 --> 01:15:14,126
English? Do you speak English?

1463
01:15:17,085 --> 01:15:19,126
Sorry. I don't know.

1464
01:15:21,418 --> 01:15:22,626
- I guess that's it.
- Yeah.

1465
01:15:22,793 --> 01:15:25,335
I feel like such an asshole saying,
"Americans, Americans."

1466
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:26,501
That's what we are.

1467
01:15:26,668 --> 01:15:27,751
Do you think he's mad about this?

1468
01:15:27,918 --> 01:15:29,293
Maybe he's offering us breakfast.
I don't fucking know.

1469
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:30,960
You're right.
He could be offering breakfast.

1470
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,876
It could just be that.
"So, come up here, have some fucking cakes."

1471
01:15:33,043 --> 01:15:34,793
Have some delicious...
Black pudding.

1472
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:35,960
Oh, there's more.

1473
01:15:36,626 --> 01:15:37,543
Hello.

1474
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:40,335
Okay...

1475
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:41,960
do you speak English?

1476
01:15:42,126 --> 01:15:43,126
- Yes. Yeah.
- A little.

1477
01:15:43,293 --> 01:15:45,168
Well, hi.
Sorry, what's the problem?

1478
01:15:45,918 --> 01:15:49,501
My father said that you placed rocks
on the door?

1479
01:15:49,668 --> 01:15:51,335
Yeah, we did. Our grandma lived here...

1480
01:15:51,501 --> 01:15:53,460
and she just died.

1481
01:15:55,793 --> 01:15:57,168
Sorry for your loss.

1482
01:15:57,335 --> 01:15:58,626
Thanks, man.

1483
01:15:58,793 --> 01:16:02,543
So why did you put rocks
in front of the door?

1484
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:05,043
It's like a tradition.
It's like a Jewish tradition.

1485
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:06,835
Like, when you visit somebody's grave...

1486
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:10,210
you're supposed to put, like, a rock on it
to show that you were, you know, there.

1487
01:16:10,376 --> 01:16:12,835
Yeah, but she's not buried
under the door, right?

1488
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:14,293
No, no, no. We just kind of...

1489
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,168
did it as, like, a sentimental thing.

1490
01:16:16,335 --> 01:16:18,668
- Like, as a, you know, a gesture.
- Okay. Yeah.

1491
01:16:18,835 --> 01:16:20,335
- Just a gesture. Yeah?
- Yeah.

1492
01:16:20,501 --> 01:16:21,710
Okay. Okay.

1493
01:16:21,876 --> 01:16:24,793
- I understand. So, this is sweet, I think.
- Thank you.

1494
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:25,918
Thanks.

1495
01:16:26,085 --> 01:16:27,085
Wait a moment.

1496
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:47,460
Okay, guys.

1497
01:16:47,626 --> 01:16:50,376
I'm sorry, but, I understand your situation.

1498
01:16:50,543 --> 01:16:52,418
But my father said that it is...

1499
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:56,335
hazard to leave the stones.

1500
01:16:57,043 --> 01:16:59,543
- Okay.
- You know, an older woman lives there now...

1501
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:01,793
- so she could trip or...
- Right.

1502
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,126
- Okay.
- Understood.

1503
01:17:03,293 --> 01:17:04,876
- So, we must, you know...
- No, I got it.

1504
01:17:05,043 --> 01:17:06,001
You got it. Sorry.

1505
01:17:06,168 --> 01:17:07,043
Yeah.

1506
01:17:08,543 --> 01:17:09,460
There you are.

1507
01:17:13,001 --> 01:17:13,876
All right.

1508
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:23,168
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
in about a half an hour...</i>

1509
01:18:23,335 --> 01:18:25,501
<i>we will begin our descent to New York.</i>

1510
01:18:25,668 --> 01:18:27,043
<i>We caught a lucky break there.</i>

1511
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:29,418
<i>We're gonna get you to your gate
about 15 minutes ahead.</i>

1512
01:18:29,585 --> 01:18:33,043
<i>Due to construction,
the gate assignment may have changed.</i>

1513
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:36,793
<i>Please check your boarding pass
for possible gate changes.</i>

1514
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,293
<i>We appreciate your patience and thank you.</i>

1515
01:18:41,168 --> 01:18:42,835
Hey, I was thinking...

1516
01:18:43,001 --> 01:18:44,501
why don't we, like, grab a cab
back to the city...

1517
01:18:44,668 --> 01:18:46,668
and you could come over for dinner?

1518
01:18:46,835 --> 01:18:47,835
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1519
01:18:48,001 --> 01:18:49,293
I mean, I know Priya would love to see you...

1520
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:53,251
and Abe would, you know, love to tell you
every fact about the Statue of Liberty.

1521
01:18:57,001 --> 01:18:58,335
- It's tempting.
- Yo, come on.

1522
01:19:00,543 --> 01:19:01,876
Nah, that's okay, man.

1523
01:19:02,043 --> 01:19:03,210
- Really?
- Yeah.

1524
01:19:03,376 --> 01:19:05,751
All right. Well, at least, I don't know,
let's grab a cab back to the city...

1525
01:19:05,918 --> 01:19:08,793
and I can drop you off at Penn Station
for your train upstate.

1526
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:13,876
You know what? I think I'm probably
just gonna kick it here for a little while.

1527
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,460
At the airport?

1528
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:18,710
Yeah. Kinda like it here.

1529
01:19:18,876 --> 01:19:20,168
You meet the craziest people, man.

1530
01:19:20,335 --> 01:19:21,335
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1531
01:19:24,918 --> 01:19:26,293
- Shit.
- What the flying fuck, man?

1532
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:27,460
- I'm so sorry. Fuck.
- Why would you do that?

1533
01:19:27,626 --> 01:19:29,001
Because Grandma, the restaurant.
You said it was, like, the best thing...

1534
01:19:29,168 --> 01:19:30,418
- that ever happened to you.
- Oh, that was...

1535
01:19:30,585 --> 01:19:32,585
Yeah, but that was different, man.
I was 18. I needed direction.

1536
01:19:32,751 --> 01:19:34,043
No, I know. That makes sense. I am so sorry.

1537
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:35,668
- This is just violence.
- I know, I know.

1538
01:19:35,835 --> 01:19:36,835
I thought it would, you know, enliven...
I don't know.

1539
01:19:37,001 --> 01:19:38,210
- It's okay.
- Are you okay?

1540
01:19:38,376 --> 01:19:39,376
Can I see? You're, like, red.

1541
01:19:39,543 --> 01:19:41,085
Yeah. Because you fuckin' slapped me
in the face.

1542
01:19:41,501 --> 01:19:42,626
- Sorry.
- Do I get one now?

1543
01:19:42,793 --> 01:19:43,793
No.

1544
01:19:47,876 --> 01:19:48,876
I'm sorry, man.

1545
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:50,751
Come here.

1546
01:19:56,085 --> 01:19:57,085
I love you, guy.

1547
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:58,126
Love you too.

1548
01:20:02,376 --> 01:20:03,293
I'm gonna be fine.

1549
01:20:04,001 --> 01:20:05,001
You know that?

1550
01:20:05,585 --> 01:20:06,751
You sure?

1551
01:20:06,918 --> 01:20:07,918
Mm-hmm.

1552
01:20:10,918 --> 01:20:11,918
Sorry.

1553
01:20:12,085 --> 01:20:13,710
- You weren't done.
- Mm-mm.

1554
01:20:17,585 --> 01:20:18,835
All right.

1555
01:20:19,001 --> 01:20:20,168
I'll see you around, cuz. Okay?

1556
01:20:20,835 --> 01:20:21,835
I'll see you.

1557
01:21:12,376 --> 01:21:13,501
Hello?

1558
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:15,043
Hello? Guys?

1559
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:17,626
- Hello? I'm...

1560
01:21:17,793 --> 01:21:18,710
Hi, hi, hi.

1561
01:21:18,876 --> 01:21:20,126

- Come here.

1562
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:22,210
Oh, hi, babe.

1563
01:21:22,376 --> 01:21:23,210
Hey.

1564
01:21:23,376 --> 01:21:24,751
- Hi, sweetness.
- Love you, love you, love you.
