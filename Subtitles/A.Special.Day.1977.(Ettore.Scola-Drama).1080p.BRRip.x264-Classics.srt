THE FUHRER’S VISIT TO ITALY

16
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,040
After a moving farewell in Berlin

17
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,043
and great displays of affection

18
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,337
for the leader of the Third Reich

19
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,547
throughout his journey across Germany,

20
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,092
the train carrying the Fuhrer enters Italy.

21
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,978
Jubilant greetings from
fascist organizations

22
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,398
all along the route

23
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:13,819
accompany Hitler on his
triumphal journey to Rome.

24
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:28,166
From the Brenner Pass to
Rome, Italy greets the Fuhrer

25
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,254
with disciplined decorum
from her political factions

26
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:36,091
and sincere spontaneity
from the general public.

27
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,927
Meanwhile...

28
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,388
the capital has prepared a welcome

29
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:45,475
of pomp combined with majestic
simplicity for the Fuhrer.

30
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,353
The fascist emblem meets the swastika,

31
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,315
and the two nations’ flags
stream side-by-side in the wind.

32
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,198
At the Ostiense railway station,
Mussolini,

33
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,493
with his foreign minister,
Count Galeazzo Ciano,

34
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:07,289
greets His Imperial Majesty the King.

35
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,547
A single cannon shot heralds

36
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,175
the arrival of the Fuhrer’s train,

37
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,011
which is greeted by the
bugle call to attention

38
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,181
and the weighty notes of
the German national anthem.

39
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:39,863
With great solemnity,
the Fuhrer of the new Germany

40
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,115
meets His Imperial Majesty

41
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,160
and II Duce, founder of the empire.

42
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,704
After this initial cordial
exchange of greetings,

43
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,499
the first state meeting between
Mussolini and the Fuhrer

44
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,709
the

45
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,379
where the founder of the empire is joined

46
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,298
by his ministers Ciano,
Starace, and Aifieri.

47
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,929
Shortly afterward,
the two leaders leave the palace

48
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,932
and take their places in an open car,

49
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,894
followed by other cars carrying
ministers of the Third Reich:

50
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,146
Von Ribbentrop, Hess,

51
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,900
and Goebbels, who have meanwhile
met with their Italian counterparts.

52
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,826
Battalions from many regiments are
drawn up along the Circus Maximus

53
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:13,415
and from Viale Africa to Porta
San Paolo and Porta Capena,

54
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,793
an area hallowed for its remains
of the ancient Roman Empire.

55
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,443
Solemn military pomp and
circumstance accompany

56
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,487
the tribute to the unknown soldier.

57
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:49,492
Immense serried ranks of legionnaires
fill Piazza Venezia.

58
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:53,204
The Fuhrer and four German
soldiers place a laurel wreath

59
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,208
with red ribbons and swastikas on
the tomb of the unknown soldier.

60
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:01,922
The two leaders stand at attention
in homage to the unknown hero.

61
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:17,646
After a barked command has
raised a forest of daggers,

62
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:22,150
a solemn hymn rises from the
massed ranks of legionnaires,

63
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:26,363
a slow hymn full of virile tenderness:

64
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,991
the battle prayer of the legionnaire.

65
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,537
Dear God

66
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:39,918
Thou who lightest every flame...

67
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,504
Listening to it, one understands

68
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,924
how the fighting spirit of
Mussolini’s legionnaires,

69
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,302
forged in the trial of battle,

70
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:53,181
has become synonymous with
heroism and sacrifice.

71
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,525
The Fuhrer’s first day in the Eternal City

72
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,778
comes to an end before an immense crowd.

73
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:11,700
But the climax of the visit will come
tomorrow on the Via dei Fori Imperiali,

74
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:16,621
where the full force of the mighty
Italian war machine will parade

75
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,373
before Hitler.

76
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,126
No citizen of Rome would
miss this historic event

77
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,379
that will seal the pact of friendship

78
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,215
between two peoples destined to be allies.

79
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,554
Umberto.

80
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,224
Umbe, get up.

81
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,977
Come on.
- Okay, okay.

82
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,858
Fabio. Arnaldo.

83
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,069
Get up.

84
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,753
Romana...

85
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,715
go use the bathroom first.
You take the longest.

86
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,722
Maria Luisa, wake up.

87
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,852
Emanuele.

88
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,982
Get up. It’s late.

89
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,277
She’s busting my balls at 5:00 a.m.!

90
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,529
Actually, it’s close to 6:00.

91
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,740
6:00?

92
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,368
Why didn’t you wake me up earlier?

93
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,787
This is the third time I’ve tried.

94
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,170
- Half a cup?
- I made it strong.

95
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,339
Maria Lui, get up.

96
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,967
You’d keep even Hitler waiting.

97
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:43,638
6:00! Now there’s no
time to do my exercises.

98
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,015
Don’t come home so late next time.

99
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,978
Can’t a man play cards
with his friends anymore?

100
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,271
Right. “Friends.”

101
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,859
Littorio, come on, sweetie.

102
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,154
I’m sleepy.

103
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,074
Getting a child up this early...

104
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,830
Don’t blame me if you’re late.

105
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,298
Come on, it’s late.

106
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,931
Your ears.

107
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,355
Anyone in the can?

108
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,357
Come on, Fabio.

109
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,568
Come wash up in the kitchen.

110
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,407
Fabio, hurry up. Your father’s waiting.

111
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,791
- Don’t push!
- I was here first.

112
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,960
My boots!

113
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,549
Give Littorio his cod liver oil.

114
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,219
Thirteen...

115
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,514
The heels are worn.
I’ll take them in tomorrow.

116
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,017
Couldn’t you have thought
of that yesterday?

117
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,399
You going to a parade or a dance?

118
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,151
Lay off.

119
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,826
Those Serbs would grab Dalmatia
but we won’t let that pass

120
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,413
If they try to take it
we’ll kick ’em in the ass

121
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,749
You and your filthy language!

122
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,252
It’s the patriotic song
we learned for the parade.

123
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,463
It’s still vulgar.;

124
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,852
What’s this?

125
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,064
- How should I know?
- It’s certainly not Saint Catherine.

126
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,234
You should be ashamed.
Your father would kill you.

127
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,236
He gave it to me!

128
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,946
I should have known.

129
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,157
Why should he care if
his son ruins his health?

130
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,119
You know you can go blind?

131
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,621
Just ask the priest.

132
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,791
Which priest?
The one who’s half blind?

133
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,793
That’s right.

134
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,132
He has cataracts, dummy.

135
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,468
And wash that stuff off your face.
You look ridiculous.

136
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,514
Aren’t you getting dressed?
- I’m not going.

137
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,559
Great.
So they flunk you in school.

138
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,811
Why aren’t you going?

139
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,606
Everyone teases me because...
I’m chubby.

140
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:44,152
You never heard of the ugly duckling?
Go on, get dressed.

141
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:51,325
- Mom, there’s a hole in this.
- Too late now.

142
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,662
Maria Lui, watch the milk.
And put the cups out.

143
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,914
Will they feed us after the parade?

144
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,709
Sure. Rations.

145
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,045
Will you help me with my waistband?

146
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,050
Get up.

147
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,386
Move back.

148
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,389
Pull.
- Put your leg in.

149
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,807
Leave me alone.

150
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,934
Littorio won’t get dressed.

151
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,021
- My arm’s inside.
- Then be more careful!

152
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,190
I can’t go like this.

153
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,361
Why not blow your nose on it too?

154
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,822
You go around dressed in rags anyway.

155
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,910
- They stole the pom-pom off my cap.
- “Pom-pom” is a foreign word!

156
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,496
Use “tassel” or “plume.”

157
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,664
Or Italianize it: pompono!

158
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,792
Try Italianizing the
literature you bring home.

159
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,502
What’s with you?

160
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,756
Your mother got up on the
wrong side of the bed.

161
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,885
Mom, they pinched my...
thingy. What should I do?

162
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,762
I’ve only got two hands!

163
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,722
Hurry up, slowpokes!

164
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,309
- Our rally is at the Circus Maximus.
- Ours is at the Obelisk of Axum.

165
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,144
Still not ready?

166
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,397
I thought you might make
your bed before you leave.

167
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,360
So sorry I said anything.

168
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,404
- That’s white.
- We’ll die it black!

169
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,783
- Is breakfast ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

170
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,857
- Me first!
- Then go! You’re always in the way!

171
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,192
- Don’t touch me.
- You scare me.

172
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:34,155
Your fez. If you have to
pee, tell your squad leader.

173
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,616
- Don’t pee in your shorts like before.
- But I did tell him!

174
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,160
Come on, squirt.

175
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,704
Since you’re staying
home, iron my blue suit.

176
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,623
I’m celebrating Rinaldi’s
promotion tomorrow with friends.

177
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,709
You know Rinaldi, right?
- No.

178
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,170
Sure you do.
He works in the archives.

179
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,255
Anyway, see you.

180
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,382
Good morning.
- Hello, Tiberi.

181
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,635
Daddy’s little cub!

182
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,847
Remember: I want to hear
all about it tonight.

183
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,017
Good morning. Aren’t you coming?

184
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:06,187
Ah, that’s right.
You don’t have domestic help.

185
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,115
- Ciao, Antonie!
- Ciao, Mom!

186
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,707
Ma’am.

187
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,170
A family only gets one mother.

188
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,050
This family needs at least three.

189
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,345
One to clean the rooms.

190
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,556
One to handle the kitchen.

191
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,521
And one to lie in bed all day.

192
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,524
I could be that one.

193
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,862
Mamma

194
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:06,909
My song wings its way to you alone

195
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,546
Mamma

196
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,632
You’ll be with me

197
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,553
You’ll never again be alone

198
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,536
Might as well start here.

199
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,897
Jam.

200
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,118
Antoneta.

201
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,419
First the beds.

202
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,554
Leave it alone.

203
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,527
“In the Land of the Pygmies.”

204
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,495
“Zounds, they’re like leeches!”

205
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,163
“Grab the Italian.”

206
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,500
“Who’d have thought

207
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:24,380
creatures this small could
be such savage beasts.”

208
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,759
“Damnation!
Our only chance is to escape...

209
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,013
into the...”

210
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,726
Antoneta.

211
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:50,531
My name’s Antonietta, not Antoneta.

212
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,575
Get my name right...

213
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,954
or don’t call me, okay?

214
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,877
Go easy on this cuttlebone.

215
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,630
It has to last till Friday.

216
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,512
I don’t have time for you this
morning, you hear?

217
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,643
I’ll give you your birdseed...

218
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,604
and you’re set for the day.

219
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,318
Where are you going?

220
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,487
Rosmunda, come back!

221
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,574
Come back here!

222
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,618
This isn’t funny!

223
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,456
Damn it!

224
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,416
Rosmunda! Good girl!

225
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,918
Stay there. Don’t move.

226
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,295
Damned bird.

227
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,271
Signore!

228
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,444
I’m sorry, but Rosmunda’s escaped.

229
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,656
Rosmunda’s escaped.

230
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:23,660
It’s not a person. It’s a mynah bird.

231
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,627
I might catch her by
reaching out your window,

232
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,754
if you wouldn’t mind.

233
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,091
Come in.

234
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,853
There she is.

235
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,648
Come here, girl.
I have some food.

236
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,274
Leave it alone.

237
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,151
Come on.

238
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,740
She hasn’t eaten since yesterday.
She has to be hungry.

239
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,201
Come here.

240
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,456
Ma’am.

241
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,086
Put the birdseed on here
and see if she’ll take it.

242
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,148
Come here.

243
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,160
Sorry for all the trouble,
but she’s like one of the family.

244
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,664
If she escaped,
there would be lots of tears tonight.

245
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,875
I’m lucky you didn’t go to the parade.

246
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:58,005
I’d have liked to go,

247
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:02,134
but with a husband and so
many children to get ready -

248
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,096
Know how many I’ve got?

249
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,682
No...

250
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,934
it was no trouble.

251
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:18,150
No, I was saying I have six kids.

252
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:22,821
One more and we get the government
bonus for large families, and -

253
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,951
You couldn’t care less.

254
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,876
Why are you laughing?

255
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,629
Just because...

256
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,383
life is made up of so
many different moments,

257
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,094
and sometimes I get this urge to laugh -

258
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,388
just like that, like a sneeze.

259
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,432
Does that ever happen to you?

260
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,435
You’re laughing at me.

261
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:58,148
No, and even if I were, I owe you thanks

262
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:02,277
for coming along at this very moment.

263
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,490
I don’t understand.

264
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,327
Don’t worry about it.
I’m not my normal self today.

265
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,127
I’ll be going. Thanks.

266
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,172
Wait!
May I offer you a drink?

267
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,008
Not that I have much.
This isn’t really my place.

268
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,259
I have to go.

269
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,054
Sit down.
I’ll make you some coffee.

270
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,765
I told you: I have to go. Thanks.

271
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,892
As you wish.

272
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,649
Sorry about the mess.
- Have you read all those?

273
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:44,111
More or less.
As I said, I have lots of free time.

274
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,363
Or maybe I didn’t say that.

275
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,950
The Four Musketeers!
Like the radio quiz show.

276
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,827
We play along every week.

277
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:55,163
There are only three in
this original version.

278
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,290
Would you like to read it?

279
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,919
I wish I could,
but it would take me forever.

280
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,713
It’s one of the ones I’m just going to -

281
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,007
Maybe another time, thanks.

282
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,343
I don’t think -

283
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,638
I’ve been here two months now

284
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,890
and we’ve never met.

285
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,686
Who knows when we’d meet again?

286
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,480
When Rosmunda escapes again.

287
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,528
Hello? Ah, it’s you.

288
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,488
Finally.

289
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,199
Yes, almost everything.

290
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,952
There’s not much. Just the books.

291
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,830
A lot of them are yours.
I was sorting them.

292
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,295
Yes, I heard about it yesterday.

293
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,923
They always do that when these
big ceremonies take place,

294
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:51,011
to be on the safe side.
They’ll let him out in a few days.

295
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,181
Oh, I’m sorry.

296
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,391
I’ll call you back later.

297
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,229
Talk to you later.

298
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,534
Wondering what they’re for?

299
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,621
Watch carefully. One, two, three...

300
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,252
And backwards. Three, two, one...

301
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,343
Simple, right? Give me your hand.

302
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,887
It’s easy. Follow the numbers.

303
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,264
Start on your left.

304
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,603
- But what is all this?
- You’ll see.

305
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,397
- What are we doing?
- The rumba!

306
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,568
You can’t be serious.

307
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,946
My oldest girl is a great dancer,

308
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,740
but at my age...

309
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:02,749
I have a run in my
stocking, a brand-new pair.

310
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,136
Very good.

311
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,099
You try.

312
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,560
It’s easy. Left foot.

313
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:26,648
Beautiful lovestruck young
girls buying your oranges

314
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,818
They have the enchanting taste...

315
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:33,071
- You go dancing a lot?
- Never!

316
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,199
- Then why learn the rumba?
- No reason.

317
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:48,962
Hail, immortal fatherland

318
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:53,383
Your sons have been born anew

319
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,804
Full of faith in the ideal...

320
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,809
You can’t really dance to that one.

321
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,895
I’ll be going.

322
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,315
I left something on the stove.

323
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,281
It was a pleasure.

324
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,199
My name’s Gabriele.

325
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,828
That’s right!
We never introduced ourselves.

326
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,706
Pleased to meet you. Antonietta Tiberi.

327
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,794
That’s a pretty name.

328
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:49,022
This is Italian National Radio,

329
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,858
with stations]n Rome, Naples, Bari,

330
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:56,112
Milan, Turin, Genoa, Trieste,
Florence, and Bolzano.

331
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,406
All our stations,

332
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,284
together with radio stations
of the German Reich,

333
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,371
and our new station in Addis Ababa,

334
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:08,625
are bringing you live coverage

335
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,378
of the military parade
in honor of the Fuhrer.

336
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,130
I caught her.

337
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,553
To the joy of labor

338
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:24,224
To peace and glory

339
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:28,937
And to the shame of those

340
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:33,358
Who would deny the Fatherland

341
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,570
O youth!

342
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:41,991
Springtime of beauty

343
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:46,204
Through the hardships of life

344
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:50,625
Your song resounds!

345
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,425
We now go to Via dei Trionfi.

346
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:07,100
The slopes of the Palatine and the Celio,

347
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:12,230
divided by one of the most illustrious
avenues in Mussolini’s Rome,

348
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,941
filled up well in advance.

349
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:18,778
Hundreds of thousands of
Italians and foreigners

350
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,823
have come from all over Italy and Europe

351
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,451
to witness this historic celebration

352
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,786
and have descended on a Rome

353
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:30,498
ready to welcome them in
her timeless austerity.

354
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,335
A joyful enthusiasm marks the waiting,

355
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:38,089
and everywhere an orderly rapidity

356
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:43,052
is powerful proof of the efficiency
of every sector of public life.

357
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,932
Nowhere is the atmosphere more
joyful than in the barracks.

358
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,978
The troops called today to a consecration,

359
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,815
just as they were called
yesterday to resounding victory,

360
00:37:55,982 --> 00:38:00,528
await, in their finest uniforms,
a signal from the huge parade.

361
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,656
The paths to be followed
by the enormous crowd

362
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,327
summoned to attend have
been laid out in advance.

363
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:12,290
The streets have the classic
appearance of those memorable events

364
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:17,086
when, flooded with a jubilant population,

365
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,631
they seem like rivers

366
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,175
overflowing with resplendent human destiny.

367
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,432
Strong and happy men,

368
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,518
soldiers of Italy

369
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:35,396
and loyal native foot soldiers
from overseas colonies,

370
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:38,775
hurry tirelessly and anxiously

371
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,861
so that the hour of veneration

372
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:46,324
will find them ever prouder
in their military glory.

373
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,249
This people, in mighty ranks,

374
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,584
armed in spirit

375
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,546
and ready to be so in deed,

376
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,924
stands ready to follow
its brilliant leader.

377
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,636
This people animated by
a virile desire for peace

378
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,265
now offers the world a superb display

379
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,643
of serene determination.

380
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,155
He called her right back.

381
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,076
What do I care anyway?

382
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:47,218
Quiet, you.
You wasted my whole morning.

383
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,935
I should be used to it.
Ever since I was a kid,

384
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:59,147
I’ve been isolated or alone -
essentially the same thing.

385
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,608
Of course you matter to me,

386
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,735
but it’s just all so absurd.

387
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,905
According to them we should
be ashamed of ourselves.

388
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,199
Earlier I was about to do -
what’s the phrase? -

389
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,452
“something foolish.”

390
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,622
A neighbor across the way
happened by just in time.

391
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,832
No, don’t worry.

392
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,044
“Life, however it may seem,
is always worth living.”

393
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:24,380
Isn’t that the line?
And a mynah bird always comes along

394
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,716
to make sure you don’t forget it.

395
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:31,137
Today’s a very particular day for
me, you know.

396
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:35,850
It’s like a dream where you want to scream

397
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,269
but nothing comes out.

398
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:42,106
I want to talk and talk!
You noticed, right?

399
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,360
I want to go out and
accost the first stranger

400
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,737
and tell him everything about myself,

401
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,448
frighten him, shock him,

402
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,700
even hit him and hurt him -

403
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:57,372
anything but be cooped up
alone in this apartment I hate.

404
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,792
Aren’t you going to say anything?
Hello?

405
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:04,045
Marco?
Say something, damn it!

406
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:07,423
Anything!
Talk about the weather, or sports,

407
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,926
or a book you’re reading.

408
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,638
I’m sorry.

409
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,934
Yes, I know how you feel too.

410
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:21,020
No, we can’t see each other.

411
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,356
It would only make things worse.

412
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:27,443
Listen, when you lose heart,
you have to pick yourself up again,

413
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,405
and right away, or there’s no hope.

414
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,907
You’re finished. Understand?

415
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,995
Why don’t we have a good laugh?

416
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,247
You can always cry alone,

417
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,958
but you need someone else to laugh with.

418
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,253
Remember that guy in
Ostia with the watermelon?

419
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:48,423
Laugh, Marco, please!

420
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:55,179
What a sad friend I’ve chosen.

421
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,100
You know what will be hardest to bear?

422
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,477
Not having you near.

423
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,855
Take care of yourself.

424
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,315
Let me know how your health is doing.

425
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:09,402
I’ll call you as soon as it happens.

426
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,531
Think of me when you can.

427
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:50,443
It makes one think of
Goethe’s travels in Italy

428
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,280
and the universal dimension
his spirit took on as a result.

429
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:58,451
If the encounter of Germanic
Romanticism with the classicism of Rome

430
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:02,705
lent such richness to Germany’s
great muse over a century ago,

431
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,166
what may come of this journey by Hitler,

432
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,628
who embodies the new Germany?

433
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,965
From every street and every piazza,

434
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,469
the crowds have surged toward
the Via dei Fori Imperiali.

435
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:20,223
The outskirts o f Rome lie deserted,

436
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,892
leaving only banners
hanging from the windows...

437
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,853
Ah, it’s you.

438
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,023
You don’t seem thrilled to see me again.

439
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:35,238
I just get a bit scared
when the doorbell rings.

440
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,741
If you ask who’s there,
they always say, “Friends...”

441
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,327
even if you’ve never met them.

442
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,579
Or only met them once.

443
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:47,333
You forgot to take this.

444
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,044
I didn’t forget.

445
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,088
I just didn’t want to impose.

446
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,215
Anyway, there’s no point.

447
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,842
No, thank you.

448
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,511
Please.
You’d be doing me a favor.

449
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,560
It even has pictures.

450
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,814
You’re so kind that...

451
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,567
feel a bit confused.

452
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,406
Airplanes!

453
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,541
When the planes fly over -

454
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,710
The famous mystique of the aviator.

455
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,628
No, it’s not that.

456
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,967
I	have to say:
This will take me a while.

457
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,344
I don’t have much time to read.

458
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,181
With all the housework...

459
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,730
Thank you again.

460
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,695
Listen...

461
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,573
would you offer me a cup of coffee?

462
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,576
Coffee?

463
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,077
Of course.

464
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,038
How rude of me.

465
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,083
Please sit down.

466
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,254
But don’t look at the mess.

467
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:19,258
As they say, “Tidiness is the
virtue of a mediocre mind.”

468
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,594
Then I’m a genius.

469
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:28,643
I’m sorry. I thought you had
some already made. Don’t bother.

470
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:32,688
No bother, but sit in there.
The kitchen’s no place for a man.

471
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,982
I’m used to it. I’m a bachelor.

472
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,234
Ah... a bachelor.

473
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:42,490
In that case you pay the bachelor tax.

474
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,033
That’s right.

475
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:47,411
You’d think loneliness
was some kind of luxury.

476
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,751
Allow me.
I’ve always enjoyed doing that.

477
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,715
My grandfather let us
do this if we were good.

478
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,385
Every grandchild gave it three turns...

479
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,680
until the coffee was ground.

480
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:10,810
He chased me off once because
I turned it four times.

481
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,566
Excuse me a moment.

482
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,735
I’ll get the coffeepot ready.

483
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,489
The great moment has come,

484
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:26,117
as the Italian and German flags
fly together

485
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:28,202
amid fierce acclamations,

486
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,080
and His Majesty Victor Emanuel III arrives,

487
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:34,000
preceded by the two leaders,

488
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,169
standing side-by-side in the black sedan.

489
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:43,426
At long last, the crowd can glimpse
II Duce at dose quarters

490
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:47,346
as the car makes its way though the masses

491
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,224
and hail him with fervent enthusiasm.

492
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:02,653
While the national
anthems mingle in the air,

493
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:06,532
performed by the Fascist
and Nazi orchestras,

494
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:10,536
the two leaders, along with His
Majesty, climb the stairs to the podium,

495
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,997
where they will take part in this rite

496
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:16,167
of great political and human significance.

497
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:27,720
The king, the Fuhrer, and U Duce

498
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,930
take their places on the royal dais}

499
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:33,059
where Her Majesty the Queen Empress
is already seated,

500
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,311
to watch the parade.

501
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:38,773
And it seems very significant

502
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:42,443
that the rows of troops
stand at attention

503
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:47,156
and present arms in this setting.

504
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,743
it’s like a declaration of the
continuity of Italy’s destiny

505
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,245
throughout the centuries.

506
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:59,752
What do you do?
Are you an office worker?

507
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,380
I’m a radio announcer.

508
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,591
A radio announcer!

509
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,637
But I’m on leave at the moment.

510
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,765
Certain matters have to be cleared up.

511
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,438
That curl across your
forehead looks nice on you.

512
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,776
It’s always falling down.

513
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,740
My husband works in the
Ministry of Italian Africa.

514
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:33,119
He’s - how should I put it? -

515
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:36,288
in charge of visitor services.

516
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:44,046
But your work must be very exciting too.

517
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,132
Yes, it is.

518
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:49,135
We don’t have a radio yet -

519
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:53,347
Who could that be?
- Friends,

520
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,683
Isn’t that what everybody says?

521
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,646
- Who is it?
- It ’s me.

522
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:05,651
You must still have the key to the roof.

523
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,070
You didn’t give it back yesterday.

524
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:11,198
I have to bring in the wash.
Is something wrong?

525
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,078
I wasn’t expecting you,

526
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,747
and when you’re alone
and the doorbell rings -

527
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,960
Exactly what I meant to tell you.

528
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:25,045
As we say in Rome,

529
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:27,673
better alone than in bad company.

530
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,634
I don’t know that man in there,

531
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,678
but it seems to me

532
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:35,014
he’s not made of the right stuff.

533
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,685
You mean the gentleman from across the way?

534
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,855
When Rosmunda got out, he very kindly -

535
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:46,192
I don’t want to be involved.
I don’t want to know.

536
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,862
But he’s a queer fish,
an eccentric old codger,

537
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,864
a bad sort.

538
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,867
I won’t mince words:

539
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,620
I don’t like him, and he doesn’t like me!

540
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,389
You’ll have to forgive me...

541
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:20,476
but that was the concierge.

542
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,895
She somehow knew you were here.

543
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,607
Maybe she saw you come up.
I didn’t tell her.

544
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:31,111
Not that I think there’s
anything wrong with it, but...

545
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,657
she’s such an old gossip...

546
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,118
that maybe it’s better if -

547
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:41,622
- You want me leave.
- I don’t want you to.

548
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:44,875
You’re so kind.

549
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,919
I’m sorry, but...

550
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,171
it would be better.

551
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:52,550
We always end up conforming
to what others think,

552
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,635
even when they’re wrong.

553
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,346
What about you?

554
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,683
You stopped grinding the
coffee when I went to the door

555
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:03,102
so no one would know you were here.

556
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,188
No.

557
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,107
Wait.

558
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:12,319
I’d like that coffee too. Come on.

559
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:15,364
I don’t want to cause any trouble for you.

560
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,533
As you said, it would be -

561
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,868
Forget what I said.

562
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,330
I don’t know about these things.

563
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:28,627
You’re a complete stranger,
and no one else is home.

564
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,839
Maybe it’s not right after all. Who knows?

565
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,967
One thing’s for sure:

566
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:38,512
You must be bored to
tears with all my chatter.

567
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:44,101
You might have done better going to a cafe.

568
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:48,814
It keeps coming down.

569
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,151
The counterweight’s not heavy enough.
It needs adjusting.

570
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:56,155
So you’re an electrician too,
besides -

571
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:59,408
what do you call it? -
a radio announcer.

572
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:04,663
So basically you talk...

573
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,832
and all Italy listens.

574
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,459
That’s right.

575
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,754
What if you suddenly start laughing?

576
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:15,341
Oh, no! Laugh on the
air and you pay a fine.

577
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:18,510
- Have you been fined?
- Have I ever!

578
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,849
Ah, here’s Rosmunda.

579
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,644
These great public events are
intended to show our guest

580
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:30,147
the magnificence of Fascist Italy.

581
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,608
Today he will see how the new generations

582
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:35,444
are educated under the
symbol of the fasces.

583
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,655
In answer to the splendor
of the military banners,

584
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:43,369
flags raised over every residence
flutter in unison,

585
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,081
and the city cloaked in Italy’s colors...

586
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:49,416
So that’s your colleague speaking?

587
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,669
Guido Notari? Yes.

588
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:55,130
One of the best.
He never laughs on the air.

589
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:00,219
That’s just the alarm clock.

590
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:04,181
I set it to go off every
hour to help manage my time.

591
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:09,603
Next time it rings, I’ll know it’s noon.

592
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,773
Wouldn’t it be easier
just to look at a clock?

593
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,025
What if I forget?

594
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,449
Are you crazy?

595
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,370
You mustn’t see this mess!

596
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:27,830
Where are you going?

597
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:30,624
I loved riding a scooter as a kid!

598
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,669
He must have a screw loose.
It’s missing a wheel.

599
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:38,257
The coffee should be ready.
Sit down over there.

600
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,426
I don’t want to be a bother.

601
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:43,429
No bother... as long as you stay put.

602
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:55,232
The Sassari Division
appears in serried ranks

603
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:59,153
with the flags of the
151st and 152nd regiments,

604
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:03,198
each decorated with two gold
medals for military valor.

605
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:06,827
Battalions of frontier
guards are also lined up,

606
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:10,164
the 60th and the 73rd
battalions of Black Shirts.

607
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:14,877
A battalion of gunners
appears in all its glory.

608
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:24,636
The division of two infantry
regiments was founded in 1884

609
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:27,639
and fought valiantly together

610
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,642
in battle after battle:

611
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,395
Saati, Dogali, Adua,

612
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,857
Bengasi, Monte Grappa, Piave.

613
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:49,661
The might of an army of 8,000,000

614
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,874
Is here represented by 30,000
men, 400 tanks,

615
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,709
400 guns...

616
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:03,258
How odd, looking into your own
apartment from your neighbor’s.

617
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,514
What did you say?

618
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,390
Nothing.

619
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:21,777
Now our troops from overseas
file past on camels.

620
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:25,489
Italian banners brought to Rome
from the African territories

621
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:27,866
pay homage from our colonies

622
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:31,370
to the great nation of
Germany, Italy’s new sister.

623
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,713
What about Rabagliati?
You know him personally?

624
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,883
I imagine him to be

625
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,886
a tall, good-looking
man who’s always happy.

626
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,930
You mean like me?

627
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,562
You don’t seem that happy to me.

628
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,773
Depends on the day.

629
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,985
I like how he sings.

630
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,612
He puts such feeling into it.

631
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:15,581
“Fascist women,
you must be the keepers of the hearth.”

632
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:23,255
“The man who is not a
husband, father, and soldier

633
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:25,382
is not a man.”

634
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:30,470
“II Duce at the Fiat factory
with Senator Giovanni Agnelli.”

635
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:51,825
“If you love Mussolini,
go ahead and tell us.

636
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:55,662
Though I’m your wedded husband,
I never could be jealous.”

637
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,956
A tune from Abruzzo.”

638
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:03,211
“It’s the Alpine Corps that makes the Alps,

639
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:06,673
not the Alps that make the Alpine Corps.”

640
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,930
You like my album?

641
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:16,808
Ah, it’s yours?
I thought it was one of your kids’.

642
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,227
No, it’s mine. You like it?

643
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:22,189
Sure.
This is a beautiful horse.

644
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:24,608
That’s Ned.

645
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:27,611
He has three:
Ned, Aprile, and Fru Fru.

646
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,571
How many sugars'?

647
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,698
Three. No, two.

648
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:39,206
They say he rides a horse
to exhaustion every morning

649
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,333
and a woman every night.

650
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,960
Poor horses.

651
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:45,212
And poor women!

652
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:51,009
They say lots of things about him.

653
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,803
Good coffee!

654
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:55,931
You were right to turn
down my coffee earlier.

655
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,561
You know...

656
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:06,233
I crossed paths with him
once, four years ago...

657
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:09,861
face to face.
- Really? Where?

658
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,947
Villa Borghese.

659
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,159
He was on horseback.

660
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:21,081
I stopped, and he glanced
my way as he galloped by.

661
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,792
It was like a fire flared up inside me.

662
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:27,004
Mind you, my arms were full of groceries.

663
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,881
My legs turned to jelly...

664
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:33,635
everything started spinning around me,

665
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,138
and I fell to the ground in a faint.

666
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:40,267
From one glance as he galloped by?

667
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,562
Some passers-by helped me up,

668
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,648
and I managed to get on the streetcar.

669
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:51,570
That same day I learned I was
expecting little Littorio.

670
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:10,589
“Genius is incompatible with the
physiology and psyche of the female

671
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,467
and is always strictly masculine.”

672
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,093
You agree?

673
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,932
Of course I agree.

674
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,934
Why?

675
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:31,693
Aren’t the history books
always full of men?

676
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,947
Sure. Maybe too full.

677
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,408
There’s no room for anyone else.

678
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,577
Least of all women.

679
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,172
You know, you’re a tough one to figure out.

680
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,761
My mother, for example, wasn’t male,

681
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:59,888
but she was a genius.

682
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,140
She wrote. She painted.

683
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,976
She worked as a bookkeeper
and supported the family,

684
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,686
not my father.

685
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,481
She made all the decisions.

686
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,651
The only decision my father ever made

687
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:15,111
was to walk out on us.

688
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,323
She was a great woman,

689
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:22,119
but she couldn’t hold on to her husband.

690
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,996
Or maybe she just didn’t want to.

691
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,803
My mother was completely different.

692
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,014
When Dad would come home at night -

693
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,350
we were living in Naples then -

694
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:50,689
That must be her again.

695
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:55,527
Please tell her that if anyone’s
looking for me, I’m here.

696
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:01,783
And try to relax.
- Why? Do I look nervous?

697
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:15,714
I brought back the key.

698
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,425
I saw you have washing out too.

699
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,927
It’s dry now.
- Thanks. I’ll go get it.

700
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,306
Is he still in there?

701
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,726
Yes, because...

702
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,896
he’s fixing the kitchen light.

703
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,314
That guy?

704
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,733
I wouldn’t let him touch my garbage pail!

705
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,820
Would you mind telling me
what you have against him?

706
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,072
I’m telling you for your sake:

707
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:44,910
hanging around with certain people
can get you in a lot of trouble.

708
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:48,580
I didn’t want to tell you before,
but that tenant from the sixth floor

709
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,416
is a no-good naysayer.

710
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:54,002
An antifascist!

711
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,671
To put it plainly...

712
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,757
he’s a son of a bitch!

713
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:03,386
No? Why do you think they
kicked him off the radio?

714
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,722
Know what they told him?

715
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,767
“You’re spitting in the plate you eat from.

716
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,770
So give us our plate back!”

717
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,734
But he’s such a decent man.

718
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:20,862
He can’t be an antifascist.

719
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:24,157
Decency has nothing to do with it.

720
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:28,578
I know a thief who plied his
trade in this very building.

721
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:33,416
Now he’s an officer in the army.

722
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,002
So what if a man’s a scoundrel?

723
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:39,839
What matters is whether
he’s faithful to the Party.

724
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,342
That’s the important thing, right?

725
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,763
Now the grenadiers of
Sardinia and Savoy file past.

726
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,975
The commander general, Benito Mussolini,

727
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:53,019
explains the great merits of the grenadiers

728
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:55,480
to the leader of the Third Reich.

729
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:58,316
The Fuhrer appears moved by this pageant

730
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:01,486
in which all of Rome’s history is felt.

731
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:03,488
I have to go -

732
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,449
Where’d he go?
- In here.

733
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:17,502
- What are you doing?
- Fixing the light.

734
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:21,214
If she comes back to check
and it hasn’t been fixed -

735
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,341
So you were eavesdropping.

736
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:26,136
Only at first.
Then you lowered your voices.

737
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:28,847
Leave that.
I have to go up on the roof.

738
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:32,517
I’m almost finished.
What did she say about me?

739
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,436
About you?

740
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,187
Nothing.

741
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,482
Why?
What do you think she said?

742
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,737
I’m generally her favorite topic -

743
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:46,156
after her late husband, that is.

744
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,533
In his death throes he refused last rites

745
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,244
and asked to be buried in
his fascist black shirt.

746
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,538
He was a great man, a true fascist.

747
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,332
He wasn’t a naysayer

748
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:57,792
or one of those... subversives.

749
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,628
Like me, right?

750
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:02,964
So she did tell you.

751
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:08,386
When people say things like that,
there’s usually some truth to it.

752
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:13,391
don’t think I’m an antifascist.

753
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:16,603
If anything, fascism is anti-me.

754
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,564
Bure, they’re all against you.

755
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,649
Spare me.

756
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,612
A little more sand.

757
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:31,451
Then tell me why you were
fired from the radio.

758
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,119
Just for fun?

759
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,622
Because -

760
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:41,711
Perhaps my voice didn’t
meet official requirements:

761
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:45,382
“solemn and martial in tone,
resonant with Roman pride.”

762
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:47,717
I had too little Roman pride -

763
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,470
maybe because I grew up in Viterbo.
- Sure.

764
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,182
You can twist words any way you like.

765
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:57,394
If you don’t mind my
coming right out with it...

766
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:00,105
they did the right thing.

767
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,445
Now I’ve got to -

768
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,032
- I got a shock!
- A shock!

769
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,868
- Just kidding.
- You can go to hell!

770
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:17,789
Enough is enough!
I almost had a heart attack.

771
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:21,126
And with her always listening
-God knows what she’s thinking!

772
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:24,879
You’ll ruin my reputation
in my own home! Get down!

773
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:28,425
- I wanted to make you laugh.
- I’m in stitches!

774
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:31,636
Look, it doesn’t fall down now.
Did I do well?

775
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:34,389
Great. Send me the bill.

776
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:40,812
It’s all buttons!
Did you make this too?

777
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:44,899
Yes, with my own hands.
You got something against it?

778
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:46,609
No, it’s wonderful.

779
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,237
Besides, now that they’ve
invented the zipper,

780
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:51,990
all those buttons have
to be used for something.

781
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:54,826
Your lame humor isn’t funny.

782
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,078
Well, good-bye.

783
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:01,166
Why are you going up instead of down?

784
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:04,586
I’ll go back across the roof so
the concierge doesn’t see me.

785
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,337
Suit yourself.

786
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:16,181
You should have told me
right off what you thought.

787
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,682
About what?

788
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:21,227
Things... like picture albums.

789
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,190
- What would it have changed?
- Everything.

790
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,525
I wouldn’t have let you in.

791
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:30,862
What are you afraid of?
You’re so sure of your convictions.

792
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,656
You bet I am! No, that’s not mine.

793
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:37,535
But I don’t feel like
discussing them with someone

794
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:40,914
who criticizes and makes fun of everything.

795
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:44,209
You’re always laughing
about serious matters.

796
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:48,296
I’m not always laughing.
I have little reason to laugh.

797
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:51,424
You’re the one who should
laugh now and then.

798
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:53,968
Things are going well for you.

799
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:59,182
You have a home, a husband, and six kids.
You should laugh a bit.

800
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:02,268
And stop using lei with me.
You know it’s forbidden!

801
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:05,813
You know it’s obligatory to use voi.

802
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:08,900
You do it on purpose.

803
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:13,488
It’s been lei this and
lei that all morning.

804
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,877
Did you leave?

805
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,173
Just as well.

806
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:35,301
Still, he could have said good-bye.

807
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:40,098
Beautiful lovestruck young
girls buying your oranges

808
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:44,394
All right - no more lei!
It’s tu from now on!

809
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:53,152
You’re finally laughing!
- I’m not laughing.

810
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:56,614
Too bad! You’re much
prettier when you laugh.

811
01:07:56,948 --> 01:07:59,117
Maybe I was once.

812
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,619
- Peace?
- Peace!

813
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,545
The blue sky, in all its spring brilliance,

814
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:13,423
Is pierced by great steel-hearted eagles

815
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:15,967
in stripes of red, white, and green,

816
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:18,720
guided by our pilots toward the stars,

817
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:21,306
beyond the outer limits of the world.

818
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,851
“Clumsy joke ends in tragedy.”

819
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:26,853
Look, you scratched me.

820
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:28,646
Serves you right.

821
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,191
What’s the matter?

822
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,738
I’m fed up

823
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:39,574
with your so-called “jokes/’

824
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:48,583
I don’t know
what you’re thinking,

825
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,877
but you’re making a big mistake.

826
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:54,505
Don’t give me that look.
You understand perfectly well.

827
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:04,891
Antonietta...

828
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,977
I assure you I had no intention -

829
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:11,105
Sure.
You grabbed me by accident.

830
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,399
You men are all the same.

831
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:17,362
I saw it coming all morning.

832
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,781
Saw it coming? From me?

833
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:23,034
First The Three Musketeers,
then the coffee.

834
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:27,205
Of course, things must be
different where you work.

835
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,208
I can do it alone.

836
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,877
No, I always helped out as a kid.

837
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:36,964
All those actresses and lady
singers and female announcers.

838
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:45,306
I suppose that’s why you put in a phone.

839
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:48,059
One can only imagine the impact

840
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,395
that contact with this illustrious city,

841
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,563
crucible of so much of human history,

842
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:56,401
will have on the mystic and meditative
spirit of the German leader.

843
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,623
Just go away.

844
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,046
Please go away.

845
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:21,259
I said please.

846
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,013
You have to go away.

847
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:30,184
When you put your arms
around me just now...

848
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:33,438
I was more angry with
myself than with you...

849
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,775
because...

850
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:45,199
I’ve hardly been able
to take my eyes off you.

851
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:57,837
You have to go.

852
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,298
I don’t know anymore^

853
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:03,926
I’ve never done this before.
You must believe me.

854
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,888
It’s the first time.

855
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:10,391
Tell me, Gabriele, please.

856
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:12,852
I have to know.

857
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:38,753
There’s a line in your album

858
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:42,006
that a man must be a husband, a father,

859
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:44,217
and a soldier.

860
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:51,807
I’m not a husband...

861
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:55,061
a father...

862
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:56,896
or a soldier.

863
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,500
What are you saying?

864
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:23,005
I wasn’t kicked off the
radio because of my voice.

865
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,929
“A useless naysayer...

866
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:33,808
with depraved tendencies/’

867
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:36,978
That’s what they said.

868
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:47,071
I don’t understand.

869
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:50,575
You understand perfectly well.

870
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:55,454
And it’s true.

871
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,762
What were you hoping for?1

872
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:15,266
Kisses? Love bites? My hands up your dress?

873
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,518
Is that what you’ve been waiting for?

874
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:21,105
Is that what a man does when
he’s alone with a woman?

875
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:23,107
All men are the same, right?

876
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:25,526
Don’t touch me! Let me go!

877
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,987
You want to feel it don’t you?

878
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:32,700
Because this muscle here is the
one that really counts, is that it?

879
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,036
Don’t touch me!

880
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:39,290
Sorry, but you got me all wrong,
sweetheart.

881
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:42,627
I’m not the virile stud
you were hoping for.

882
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:45,129
I’m a faggot. A faggot!

883
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:47,131
That’s what they call us.

884
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:51,344
At the local pool hall,
if they caught one of us around,

885
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:55,306
they’d pull down his pants
and ram a pool cue up his ass!

886
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:57,934
What do you know
about anything?

887
01:13:58,059 --> 01:14:02,813
You’re just an ignorant
little housewife in heat...

888
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,232
but oh so very proper!

889
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:07,318
One of those who say,

890
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:10,655
“It was a moment of weakness.
What must you think of me?”

891
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:15,076
Prepared to fornicate on the roof,
but ready to judge and condemn.

892
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:18,162
What the hell would you know?

893
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,123
- The concierge will hear!
- Let her! I’ll call her myself!

894
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:23,709
Hey, concierge!

895
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:26,837
That way everyone will
finally know for sure

896
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:29,757
that the tenant on the
sixth floor is a queer...

897
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,676
a pansy...

898
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:34,053
a homosexual!

899
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,556
A faggot.

900
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,311
To describe on the radio,
to all of Italy and the world,

901
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,772
this pageant on Via dei Trionfi

902
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:47,149
fills us with sincere pride.

903
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:49,735
Composed of mighty battalions,

904
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:54,198
the military strength of the
fascist people, of our people’s army

905
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:58,077
parades in the Roman light
before our esteemed guest.

906
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:06,502
All the most modem vehicles and weapons

907
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:09,839
that make up a strong and fearsome army

908
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:14,301
roar by before the leader
of our sister nation,

909
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:18,347
who looks on,
visibly surprised and pleased.

910
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:36,449
While troops march along
the chosen streets,

911
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:40,786
the crowd calls out to
II Duce in reaffirmation

912
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:44,081
of its ecstatic tribute
of devotion and faith.

913
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,211
He comes second only to God.

914
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:52,256
“God gives us bread.
II Duce defends it for us. ”

915
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:55,134
Such is the feeling of the people.

916
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:23,454
The crowd surges impatiently

917
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:26,916
to hear the words of Mussolini and Hitler,

918
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:30,211
which will be broadcast by loudspeaker.

919
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:45,184
The 14th Fascist draft
boasts of having recruited

920
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:49,980
1,353,716 new members to the Party...

921
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,622
I’m sorry.

922
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:10,584
Why don’t you come in?

923
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:13,087
I’m making an omelet.

924
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,032
The crowd calls out to the two leaders

925
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:46,036
to renew its exultant tribute
of trust and devotion.

926
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:53,127
The moment has arrived,

927
01:17:53,252 --> 01:17:57,798
amid bugles and drums and clamoring crowds.

928
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:20,571
A majestic silence falls.

929
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:23,032
Benito Mussolini, founder of the empire,

930
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:25,618
extends a salute from Fascist Italy

931
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:28,204
to the leader
of the Third Reich.

932
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,585
Fascist Italy

933
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:39,465
knows but one ethical law in friendship.

934
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:53,270
This law has been, is
being, and will be obeyed

935
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:59,276
by the collaboration between
Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.

936
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:07,284
I even got engaged to a girl once,

937
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:10,287
a girl at the radio station,

938
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:13,165
to put up a false front.

939
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:17,336
I took her out to dinner and to the movies,

940
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:20,714
wherever we’d be sure to be seen together.

941
01:19:21,799 --> 01:19:25,719
I pretended I was crazy about
her, and she did the same.

942
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,473
She was a good friend who wanted to help.

943
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:34,812
But maybe I didn’t play
my part too well.

944
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:41,068
Management called me in one day and said...

945
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:46,156
I was no longer part of the
family at Italian National Radio.

946
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:49,326
“You’re not a Party member.”
“But I am!”

947
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:51,495
“Not any more...

948
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:54,206
because people like you

949
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:58,836
can’t be members of our Party,
which is a party of real men.”

950
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:05,259
So I tried to bluff...

951
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:09,054
by showing them a medical
certificate stating

952
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:11,432
I wasn’t a homosexual,

953
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:15,185
that I was a normal man.

954
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:18,397
- Did they believe you?
- Are you kidding?

955
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:20,607
It only made things worse.

956
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:22,776
That was a bad move.

957
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:25,237
If you’re not a homosexual,

958
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:29,116
you don’t walk around with a
certificate to that effect.

959
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:38,709
That’s the worst part.

960
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:43,547
You try to seem different
from what you really are.

961
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:48,218
They force you to feel ashamed of yourself.

962
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:50,512
To hide.

963
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:02,232
But you told me.

964
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:05,569
With you I found the courage.

965
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,739
You’re not like the others.

966
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:12,326
That’s not true.

967
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:15,496
I slapped you.

968
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:20,167
True, but you’re here with me now.

969
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:47,778
How do you get by?

970
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:53,283
I mail out advertising for
a big department store.

971
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:56,745
I write customers’
addresses on the envelopes.

972
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:02,793
I took the job over from... a friend.

973
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,297
He was taken away over a year ago.

974
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:11,844
He’s interned in Sardinia, at Carbonia.

975
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:14,972
Was he a...

976
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:17,266
subversive?

977
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:20,436
A subversive... like me.

978
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:22,646
went to see him off.

979
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:29,945
I last saw him as he boarded
the boat at Civitavecchia.

980
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:32,448
I watched him walk up the gangplank.

981
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:46,086
You have beautiful handwriting.

982
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:49,381
Would you mail one to me?

983
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:04,563
There are lots of times
when I feel humiliated too.

984
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:09,860
Treated like a nobody.

985
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:18,076
My husband doesn’t talk to me.
He orders me around...

986
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,704
day...

987
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:24,208
and night.

988
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:31,215
We haven’t laughed together
since we were engaged.

989
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:40,057
He does his laughing elsewhere
now, with other women.

990
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:42,309
You mean he’s unfaithful?

991
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:46,730
You seemed so secure and happy.

992
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,111
“Faithful.”

993
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:56,490
To the fatherland.

994
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:00,577
You know those places...

995
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:06,291
where men go and pay for women?

996
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:11,380
They know him better there
than in his own office.

997
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:18,428
If only that was all.

998
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:29,439
Last month I found a letter
from someone named Laura...

999
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:34,569
a schoolteacher on Via Ruggero Bonghi.

1000
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:40,117
He picks a woman with an education.

1001
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,124
It’s as if he -

1002
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:55,299
It’s like telling a woman
she’s ignorant and second-rate.

1003
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:02,514
Oh, I don’t deny it.
I didn’t have much schooling.

1004
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:05,642
A letter like that -

1005
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:09,730
Even back when I was fond of him...

1006
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:13,942
never wrote him a letter like that...

1007
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:20,532
because I don’t know how.

1008
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:33,795
You can treat an uneducated
woman any way you like,

1009
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,922
because you don’t respect her.

1010
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:45,807
I like you, Gabriele.

1011
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:48,060
I like you...

1012
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:51,355
just as you are.

1013
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:55,525
All those things you told me.

1014
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:59,446
I don’t care about them.

1015
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:06,244
You’re very kind.

1016
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:17,255
I’m thinking of myself.

1017
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:37,609
Hike it when you touch me.

1018
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:23,525
It’s funny.

1019
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:26,194
I don’t feel guilty at all.

1020
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:30,115
Just the opposite.

1021
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,662
It was never like that with him.

1022
01:29:43,253 --> 01:29:45,797
I never thought it could be like that.

1023
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:51,928
What about you?

1024
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:55,223
The way I am...

1025
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:59,561
doesn’t mean I can’t make love to a woman.

1026
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:01,605
It’s different.

1027
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:05,358
It was very nice...

1028
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:07,777
but it doesn’t change anything.

1029
01:30:30,634 --> 01:30:32,802
Meeting you, getting to know you...

1030
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:36,014
talking with you,
spending the whole day with you -

1031
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,642
today of all days -

1032
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:42,103
has been very important for me.

1033
01:30:58,161 --> 01:31:01,122
I’ll look across at
your window every day...

1034
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:06,169
the way I did this morning
when I went back home.

1035
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:09,881
I kept watching you.

1036
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:12,592
I couldn’t get anything done.

1037
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:18,848
And next Saturday,
when everyone goes off to the rally...

1038
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:24,354
it’ll be enough just to see you...

1039
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:27,732
and hear your voice.

1040
01:31:32,028 --> 01:31:34,072
Good evening.

1041
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:36,491
How was the parade?

1042
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:40,578
Wonderful, huh?
I heard it all on the radio.

1043
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:48,628
They’re coming back.

1044
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,505
I have to go.

1045
01:33:40,406 --> 01:33:43,243
Good evening, sir, ma’am.

1046
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:46,746
I listened to the whole thing on the radio.

1047
01:33:47,205 --> 01:33:49,332
Did you have a good time?

1048
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:52,669
What’s Hitler like?
- He’s so handsome!

1049
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:58,716
I heard it all on the radio.
I enjoyed every minute.

1050
01:33:58,925 --> 01:34:01,511
Was the parade nice?
- Great.

1051
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:05,098
A historic day for Italy! -1 agree.

1052
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:12,689
- Did you see that fat general?
- That was Goering.

1053
01:34:12,814 --> 01:34:16,025
- Wasn’t it Hess?
- He’s the crazy-looking one.

1054
01:34:16,192 --> 01:34:18,653
The entire top brass of
our great sister nation.

1055
01:34:18,778 --> 01:34:20,280
My feet hurt.

1056
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:35,712
- Fulvio, did you get tired?
- No.

1057
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:04,324
We were all shouting, “Duce! Duce! Duce!”

1058
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:06,576
And he was lapping it up.

1059
01:35:06,743 --> 01:35:09,662
But then he gestured
toward Hitler as if to say,

1060
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:13,249
“Don’t forget our guest,” and
everyone clapped even louder.

1061
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:18,004
- I didn’t see that.
- You were too far away. I saw it all.

1062
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:21,382
Antonietta, you really missed something.

1063
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:25,261
Hey, am I supposed to eat
my minestrone with a fork?

1064
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:27,430
What’s the matter
with you tonight?

1065
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:31,100
A fateful day.

1066
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:33,686
Unforgettable.

1067
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:36,481
And you all had the privilege

1068
01:35:36,606 --> 01:35:38,691
of witnessing it in person.

1069
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:43,196
In 20 or 30 years’ time you
can tell your children...

1070
01:35:44,113 --> 01:35:46,407
“I was the re that day”

1071
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:50,620
They gave me one bread roll all day.

1072
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:55,792
- What’s all this?
- The pom-pom.

1073
01:35:55,959 --> 01:35:58,461
Mom, pass the mortadella.

1074
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:04,133
A cold dinner.
Didn’t do a thing all day, did you?

1075
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:06,260
Wasn’t it a national holiday?

1076
01:36:06,386 --> 01:36:09,514
And you stayed home in bed.

1077
01:36:12,141 --> 01:36:15,228
We have more tanks than the rest of Europe.

1078
01:36:15,353 --> 01:36:16,980
Even more than America, Dad?

1079
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:19,732
Sure. All they can do is make movies.

1080
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:23,653
They’re still fighting the
Indians with bows and arrows.

1081
01:36:24,654 --> 01:36:26,990
I think the air force is the most exciting.

1082
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:29,659
- No, the navy.
- Shows what you know.

1083
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:32,328
Too bad we didn’t see any ships.

1084
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:35,915
Right. Imagine a battleship parading past!

1085
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:38,835
- Will you cut it out?
- Hands off!

1086
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,754
You’ll have lots of pictures
for your album, Mom.

1087
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:47,802
There’ll be lots of pictures
to clip in tomorrow’s paper.

1088
01:36:50,263 --> 01:36:52,348
I’m hoarse from all the singing.

1089
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:54,434
You see the German band on horseback?

1090
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:56,352
They were fantastic!

1091
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:58,730
I don’t know how they do it.

1092
01:36:58,855 --> 01:37:02,525
It’s the Fuhrer’s personal band.
They’re with him everywhere.

1093
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,193
Even at home.

1094
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,904
Mom, Littorio’s eating with his left hand.

1095
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:11,200
How come the Germans do the
goose step better than us?

1096
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:13,244
Because it’s hard!

1097
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:15,872
Come on.
We’re pretty impressive too.

1098
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:18,708
Did you see the Alpine Corps?
- Sure did.

1099
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:21,711
But the German uniforms
are much more elegant.

1100
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:25,882
You gotta admit: We know
how to pick our allies, huh?

1101
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,800
If there’s another war,

1102
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:30,678
we’ll kick all their asses!

1103
01:38:03,461 --> 01:38:07,173
Antonie, a day like today
calls for a celebration,

1104
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:09,967
and if we have a seventh,
we’ll call him Adolf.

1105
01:38:10,093 --> 01:38:12,428
No, not tonight.

1106
01:38:12,762 --> 01:38:14,931
Just hurry up and come to bed.

1107
01:38:19,102 --> 01:38:20,895
We’ll discuss it then.

1108
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:23,082
“That first Monday of April 1625,

1109
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:24,876
the town of Meung,

1110
01:39:25,001 --> 01:39:27,753
birthplace of the author
of the Romance of the Rose,

1111
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:29,797
was in complete chaos,

1112
01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:33,676
as if the Huguenots aimed to
make of it a second La Rochelle.”

1113
01:41:01,973 --> 01:41:05,434
- I’m just about ready.
- Take your time.

1114
01:41:05,559 --> 01:41:08,271
- When does the boat leave?
- In three hours.

1115
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:40,636
“Imagine a Don Quixote aged
18, with a long face

1116
01:41:53,566 --> 01:41:57,194
“...a long face with high
cheekbones, a sign of craftiness

1117
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:36,233
“...all the more painful
to young D’Artagnan...”
