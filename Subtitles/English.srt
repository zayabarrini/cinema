00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,151
Calm down, your escort is right
outside. Sit down.

4
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,987
Sit. I said sit.

5
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,406
She tells us that you are
her niece.

6
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,033
Is that correct? Are you her niece?

7
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,660
Where is your mother?

8
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,037
Do you know?

9
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,959
Look at me!
Do you understand me?

10
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,921
If you are from Budapest,
state the name and street number

11
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,714
of your former place of residence.

12
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,466
There's a pen and paper.

13
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,636
If you prefer not to speak to us,
write it down with your family name,

14
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,096
and we will try and confirm it.

15
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,765
Is it possible the woman outside
is not related to you,

16
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,227
but is simply an ally you made
along the way who is trying to help you?

17
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,396
You bear little resemblance
to one another.

18
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:29,358
We will not punish her for trying
to help an innocent young woman.

19
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,027
We want to help you get home.

20
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,154
Your true home.

21
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,824
<i> László, I am alive.</i>

22
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,910
Come on! Documents.

23
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:44,456
<i> Attila tells me that you, too, are alive</i>
<i>and en route to him from Bremerhaven.</i>

24
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:45,749
<i>Rejoice!</i>

25
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:50,504
<i>I cried out in ecstasy</i>
<i>to have news of you.</i>

26
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,298
Where are my things?

27
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,967
- What?
- Screw you!

28
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,176
It is not amusing to me!

29
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,220
Stop it! Don't look at me that way,
old man!

30
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,889
- It's right behind you.
- Where is my luggage?

31
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,515
It's tucked there under the mattress!

32
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,808
Now come on!

33
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,936
Hurry, László,
or we'll be last in the queue.

34
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:11,901
<i> Zsófia is with me, though she is</i>
<i>frail, strange, and quite ill.</i>

35
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,030
<i>We anxiously await</i>
<i>our being repatriated,</i>

36
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,157
<i>but recently, she has not been herself,</i>

37
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:21,827
<i>which has, in turn, roused unnecessary</i>
<i>suspicions with local officials.</i>

38
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,258
<i>Fortunately, a few Soviet boys</i>
<i>have taken a liking to us.</i>

39
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,595
<i>They pity your poor niece in particular,</i>

40
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,183
<i>who has grown fuller, even lovelier,</i>
<i>since you last set eyes on her.</i>

41
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:48,354
<i>These lonesome young servicemen</i>
<i>are ostensibly entranced</i>

42
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,441
<i>by such a radiant creature's</i>
<i>commitment to absolute silence.</i>

43
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,817
Excuse me, sorry.

44
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,820
<i> The Soviets have helped us</i>
<i>relocate</i>

45
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,573
<i>to a nearby shelter</i>
<i>for displaced persons in Vas.</i>

46
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,953
<i>They encourage us</i>
<i>to "enjoy our freedoms",</i>

47
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,038
<i>but I am reminded of Goethe.</i>

48
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,040
<i>"None are more hopelessly enslaved</i>

49
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,292
<i>than those</i>
<i>who falsely believe themselves free!"</i>

50
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:16,256
<i>I make no mistake,</i>
<i>we are not yet free.</i>

51
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,508
Come on already.

52
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:21,929
<i> You, like myself, must be</i>
<i>envisioning so many terribly awful, awful things,</i>

53
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:25,766
<i>but it is better that your thoughts</i>
<i>do not get the best of you.</i>

54
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,437
<i>It is neither better nor worse</i>
<i>than you might imagine.</i>

55
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,194
<i>I have kept myself mostly to myself.</i>

56
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,157
<i>More importantly,</i>

57
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,788
<i>I have defended Zsófia</i>
<i>from unwanted advances.</i>

58
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:56,880
<i>Below is the address</i>
<i>I am told for mail in Vas.</i>

59
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,719
<i>Please write to me at once</i>
<i>when you have received this.</i>

60
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,764
<i>I am certain now</i>

61
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,766
<i>there is nothing left for us here.</i>

62
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,269
Look at that!

63
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,236
- What did I tell you?!
- Yes!

64
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:26,035
<i>Go to America and I will follow you.</i>

65
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,667
<i>Faithfully, Erzsébet.</i>

66
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,097
For those of you
that don't speak English,

67
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,850
please engage myself
or any of my colleagues

68
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,018
located in the back

69
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,394
so we may inform you

70
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,064
about our language
and orientation programmes,

71
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,357
which are held
in this very room,

72
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,151
425 Lafayette.

73
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,570
Remember that address.

74
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,406
Additionally, classes
and daily meetings are held

75
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,784
where many of you
will be sleeping tonight

76
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,577
over at the Hotel Marseilles,

77
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,914
located on 103rd and Broadway.

78
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,417
Those of you for whom none of
the aforementioned details apply

79
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,212
and who will be immediately
departing for other destinations

80
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:23,175
in the morning, please see me
about your $25 travel aid.

81
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,761
These vouchers
are redeemable on trains

82
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,888
and participating bus services.

83
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,684
<i>This is Albert B Chandler.</i>

84
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,437
<i>At this time, I would like</i>
<i>to introduce a boy</i>

85
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,315
<i>who will be under</i>
<i>the leadership of Babe Ruth</i>

86
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,069
<i>when Babe takes over his new</i>
<i>job as director of baseball</i>

87
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,029
<i>for the American Legion.</i>

88
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,865
<i>Representing the boys</i>
<i>of the American Legion,</i>

89
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,660
<i>speaking</i>
<i>for every American boy,</i>

90
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,662
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>here is Larry...</i>

91
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,067
It has been some time, sorry.

92
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,278
What's wrong?

93
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,822
- Don't you think I'm beautiful?
- I do.

94
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,159
Which parts of me
do you find most beautiful?

95
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,285
All parts.

96
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,828
Stop it.

97
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,081
I don't find all the parts
of you beautiful.

98
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,167
Fuck her already!

99
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,501
Shut up.

100
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,669
Fuck her.

101
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,421
Can you tell your friend
to be polite?

102
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,256
Shut your mouth!

103
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,179
My legs? Are they too thin?

104
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,473
No.
You are well proportioned.

105
00:07:55,184 --> 00:08:00,689
It is the space above your brow
for me which is the problem.

106
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,733
What did you say?

107
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,860
That is something I do not like.

108
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,990
Your face is ugly.

109
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,826
I know it is.

110
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,923
We have boys, if you prefer.

111
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,550
No, thank you.

112
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,804
Brothers with dark skin,
but handsome.

113
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,017
No, no. Not for me.

114
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,270
- Wait!
- Wait!

115
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,147
Wait! Wait!

116
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,565
- Hey!
- Hey!

117
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,901
Hey! Hey! Hey!

118
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,527
- Hey, thank you. Thank you.
- Thanks.

119
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,368
It was great. It was great.

120
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,578
I'll see you.

121
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,247
I'll see you.

122
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,165
- I will see you.
- I will see you.

123
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,292
- I will see you.
- Great. Wait, wait.

124
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,797
- For the luck. For the luck.
- Thanks.

125
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,840
- Bye, friend.
- Bye, friend.

126
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,133
See you.

127
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,387
Bye.

128
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,934
Take care.

129
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,065
See you.

130
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,862
<i>Perhaps no state or nation</i>

131
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,572
<i>in all the history of man</i>

132
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,075
<i>has been the deciding ground</i>
<i>of so many human issues</i>

133
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,285
<i>as has the state</i>
<i>of Pennsylvania.</i>

134
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,621
<i>Decisions that founded</i>

135
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,665
<i>of a great nation,</i>

136
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,791
<i>that brought into being</i>

137
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,252
<i>important</i>
<i>colonisation movements,</i>

138
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,921
<i>that established freedom</i>
<i>of worship in America,</i>

139
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,215
<i>that founded great religions,</i>

140
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,343
<i>that gave birth to America's</i>
<i>educational system,</i>

141
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,388
<i>that launched</i>
<i>tremendous industrial empires,</i>

142

00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,939
<i>Here is where things happen,</i>

145
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,900
<i>where industry is making</i>
<i>the greatest strides</i>

146
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,945
<i>of any state or nation</i>

147
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,488
<i>Pennsylvania.</i>

148
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:22,367
<i>Land of decision for America,</i>
<i>for American industry,</i>

149
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,327
<i>and for American families.</i>

150
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,882
<i>Attila.</i>

151
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,056
Cousin.

152
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,224
Cousin.

153
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,233
Erzsébet is alive.

154
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,779
What? What?

155
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,240
What did you say?

156
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,534
What did you say?

157
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,786
I have a letter from her.

158
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:12,584
Your Erzsébet is alive
and she is with little Zsófia.

159
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,004
Yes?

160
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,343
Yes?

161
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,345
Yes?

162
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,191
Yes?

163
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,828
Thank you. Thank you.

164
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,301
It's a combination of things,

165
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:08,098
but I would say the most popular
is the cabinetry

166
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,685
which we do ourselves,
custom-to-order.

167
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,520
The lamps, too.

168
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,567
And here it is.

169
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:23,113
Audrey did the displays.

170
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,159
He's talking like an American
from the television now.

171
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:31,705
Yes, well,
we don't have a television,

172
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,374
but he's been here
since before I was born,

173
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,043
and still doesn't sound like
any American I've ever met.

174
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,753
Eight years ago,

175
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,798
we tried opening something
similar in Manhattan.

176
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,717
We lasted two months.

177
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,095
We couldn't compete
with the name brands.

178
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,598
Newlyweds,
they come in with a...

179
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,891
an issue
of <i>Better Homes and Gardens</i>

180
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,518
and they say,

181
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,523
"We like that table
next to the perfume ad."

182
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,359
And we say, "Well, we can
make you something like that."

183
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,821
And they say,
"No, sir, we want exactly that."

184
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,700
Yeah. Turns out
we don't like New York at all.

185
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,368
No charm, right, Audrey?

186
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,787
Every little urchin
you come across,

187
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:17,042
and seller, buyer, delivery boy,
is running a hustle.

188
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:21,463
I'm from Connecticut myself.
Do you know it?

189
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:25,342
Of course he doesn't know it,
Audrey. He just got here.

190
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,344
Give me that.

191
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,346
So...

192
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,475
Cleared out a space for you
in the back.

193
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,478
Audrey made you a bed.

194
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,614
It's just there.

195
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,201
A cot and a lamp for now, but...

196
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:55,246
feel free to take anything
you want from the showroom.

197
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,040
That's all I need.

198
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:03,171
And for the employee restroom,
you go out the front door,

199
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,966
around the back to where
I parked the car, you remember?

200
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:10,762
There's a stairway there that
takes you up to our apartment.

201
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,765
If you need anything,
you just knock.

202
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,353
You and your wife
have done more than enough.

203
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,491
You know, we know someone

204
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,702
who could take a look
at your nose.

205
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,707
I thought maybe
no one would notice.

206
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,293
What happened?

207
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,046
If you don't mind my asking.

208
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,759
I jumped from a railcar.

209
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:53,847
A few moments later, there was
a loud cracking sound and...

210
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,516
I thought someone
had shot me in the head,

211
00:16:56,641 --> 00:17:00,311
but I'd merely run
into the branch of a tree.

212
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,898
No one was shooting at me.

213
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,610
I take something for the pain
but...

214
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,782
I'd like to have it looked at.
Thank you.

215
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,660
We'll give Kenneth a call.

216
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:19,122
Come. Take a seat at my desk.

217
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,875
I'll fetch some towels.

218
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,396
Is it smaller than you expected?

219
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:45,940
What?

220
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,652
Oh, the shop.

221
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,029
No.

222
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,824
No, I had no expectation.

223
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,540
Who is Miller?

224
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,794
I'm Miller.

225
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,214
No, you are Molnár.

226
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,008
Not anymore.

227
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,516
- No Miller, no sons.
- Yeah.

228
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,977
The folks here,
they like a family business.

229
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,325
So what do you think?

230
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,661
Of what? The furniture?

231
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,539
No, well, I meant
of everything so far.

232
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,374
Philadelphia.

233
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,210
But, sure,
the pieces on the floor also.

234
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,797
They're not very beautiful.

235
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,099
Well, that's what
you are here for.

236
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,477
Maestro.

237
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,234
Next month,
I can put you on the payroll.

238
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:17,156
If you want, you can eat with us
upstairs on Sundays.

239
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,410
You have done more than enough.

240
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:23,913
- Don't mention it.
- I <i>do</i> mention it.

241
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,164
I <i>do</i> mention.

242
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,417
Thank you.

243
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,219
Gentile?

244
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,765
She's Catholic.

245
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,147
We are Catholic.

246
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:01,492
<i> László, I am alive.</i>

247
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:06,456
<i>Attila tells me that you, too, are alive</i>
<i>and en route to him from Bremerhaven.</i>

248
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,416
<i>Rejoice!</i>

249
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,128
<i>I cried out in ecstasy</i>
<i>to have news of you...</i>

250
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,970
We welcome donations.
Please help the homeless.

251
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,768
Help the homeless.
Please help the homeless.

252
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,523
Your donations help to provide
shelter, food, clothing...

253
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,360
Please help the homeless.

254
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,822
Help the homeless.

255
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,911
It's your turn now,
William.

256
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,913
Please help the homeless.

257
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,916
I spy with my eye
something blue.

258
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,717
Is it this gentleman's coat?

259
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,513
He's clever.

260
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:06,557
You're right.
There is a little blue in it.

261
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,184
Listen up!

262
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,895
Kitchen's closed, folks.
Get back early tomorrow.

263
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,775
Wait! Hold on.
I got a kid here.

264
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,611
Sorry, we're fresh out.

265
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,447
Come find me in the morning.
I'll make sure he gets a plate.

266
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,783
You must have a slice of bread.

267
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,995
He's just a little boy.
There are children here.

268
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,455
How many times
do you people want me to say it?

269
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,999
There's nothing left here.

270
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,295
Thank you, sir.

271
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,717
Will he be all right?

272
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,971
There's somewhere else
we can try tonight.

273
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,307
Then let him sleep tomorrow.

274
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,310
I will be here early.

275
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:55,064
Come to me here.
I will hold a place.

276
00:21:58,568 --> 00:21:59,694
Good night.

277
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,866
No one deserves
to be on our streets.

278
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,828
I don't deserve
to be on our streets again.

279
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,039
Whatever you can spare
from your hearts.

280
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,750
Thank you for listening.

281
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,378
God bless all of you.
Have a pleasant weekend.

282
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:35,938
Pardon.

283
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,932
- Rabbi Zunz?
- Yes.

284
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:11,849
Good morning.

285
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,059
Good morning.

286
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,686
My niece and wife...

287
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,899
I have learned the two are stuck
at the Austrian boundary.

288
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:25,238
Wait not many minutes for me
and we can speak after.

289
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:27,532
Mikveh Israel can try and help,

290
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:31,869
but from here, it is very
difficult, as you know.

291
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:35,039
I will wait for you. Thank you.

292
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,999
- Thank you very much.
- Wait.

293
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:50,221
<i>On the 29th of November, 1947,</i>

294
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:56,811
<i>the United Nations General Assembly</i>
<i>passed a resolution</i>

295
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:02,984
<i>calling for the establishment</i>
<i>of a Jewish state in Eretz Yisrael.</i>

296
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:09,657
<i>The General Assembly required</i>
<i>the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael</i>

297
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:13,744
<i>to take such steps</i>
<i>as were necessary on their part</i>

298
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:18,624
<i>for the implementation</i>
<i>of that resolution.</i>

299
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:23,212
<i>This recognition by the United Nations</i>

300
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:29,719
<i>of the right of the Jewish people</i>
<i>to establish their state is irrevocable.</i>

301
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:34,557
<i>This right is the natural right</i>
<i>of the Jewish people</i>

302
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:37,685
<i>to be masters of their own fate,</i>

303
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:42,315
<i>like all other nations,</i>
<i>in their own sovereign state.</i>

304
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:48,070
<i>Accordingly we,</i>
<i>members of the people's council,</i>

305
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:53,159
<i>representatives of the Jewish</i>
<i>community of Eretz Yisrael</i>

306
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,369
<i>and of the Zionist Movement,</i>

307
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,788
<i>are here assembled</i>
<i>on the day of the termination</i>

308
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,249
<i>of the British mandate</i>
<i>over Eretz Yisrael.</i>

309
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:06,505
<i>And by virtue of our natural</i>
<i>and historic right,</i>

310
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:13,596
<i>and on the basis of the resolution</i>
<i>of the United Nations General Assembly,</i>

311
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:18,392
<i>hereby declare the establishment</i>
<i>of a Jewish state in Eretz Yisrael,</i>

312
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,436
<i>to be known as the State of Israel.</i>

313
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:27,818
I'm not sure what to do
with them, is all.

314
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,115
What do you think
I should pair it with?

315
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:35,910
Leave it.

316
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,329
How?

317
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,791
Leave it like that.

318
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:46,712
Looks like a tricycle.

319
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,715
What is that?

320
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,679
It's a bike for kids.

321
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:06,274
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

322
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,405
Did Peter Piper pick
a peck of pickled peppers?

323
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:20,246
If Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers,

324
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:26,752
where is the peck of pickled
peppers Peter Piper picked?

325
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:49,734
Hey. Come with me.

326
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,363
We have an important client
inside.

327
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,866
I furnished him a two-storey
office space downtown

328
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:58,576
on the cheap last year.

329
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:02,580
He's interested in us doing
some built-in work for him

330
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:04,206
at a residence.

331
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:10,254
Can you give a little smile
for him? Huh? Sell it?

332
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:14,300
Why are you always
such a businessman?

333
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:19,722
You are selling,
always selling, selling.

334
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:30,691
Mr Van Buren.

335
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,905
Let me introduce you
to my cousin László.

336
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:40,117
Please. That's what people
call my father.

337
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,577
Call me Harry.

338
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,206
Well, Harry would like
some shelving units installed

339
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,625
over at his family's property
in Doylestown.

340
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,044
Sorry to interrupt.

341
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,005
I hoped that someone
might follow me out there

342
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,049
to take a look
at my father's study.

343
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,718
My sister and I would like
to surprise him, you see,

344
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,596
by turning it into
a proper library.

345
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,264
How do you mean?

346
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,101
Well, the place
is in complete disarray.

347
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:07,853
A whole mess
of books and paperwork.

348
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,398
So I guess we'd just like
some tall shelves

349
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,109
and cabinetry installed.

350
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:16,112
Maybe make him a ladder
with little wheels on it.

351
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:18,531
You know? Like you'd see
in a real library.

352
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:21,534
He's a voracious reader.

353
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:24,245
Yeah, we can make you
something like that.

354
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:28,040
Let me have Audrey come down
and keep an eye on the place

355
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,959
and I'll pull the van around.

356
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,545
- Fantastic.
- I'll be right back.

357
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,689
They pay you well?

358
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:57,153
On the last job,
they paid OK.

359
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,197
Took on a lot of pieces, though.

360
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,868
They kept adding to the order.
Even at a discount, it adds up.

361
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,037
His old man got flush

362
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:09,915
adapting production techniques

363
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,170
to expedite the manufacturing
of cargo ships during the war.

364
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,800
Christ, is this guy
trying to shake us?

365
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,303
Thinks it's a drag race?

366
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,346
Hey, come on, already!

367
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,482
Stay right until you see
the main house.

368
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,317
You can park wherever you like.

369
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,724
<i>I do appreciate</i>
<i>you coming out here</i>

370
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,434
on such short notice, gentlemen.

371
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,020
Father is away
only until next Friday.

372
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,730
I was anxious to pin this down.

373
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:17,691
Ah, it's no
inconvenience for us, chief.

374
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:19,818
It's your lucky day, too,

375
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:24,406
'cause my cousin here
is a licensed architect,

376
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:26,075
a specialist in renovations.

377
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,745
He even designed a library
back at home before.

378
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,789
Right? A whole city library.

379
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:33,332
What city is that?

380
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:39,296
- Budapest.
- I see. Never been.

381
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:43,050
Don't mind the mess.

382
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,852
I know.
It's terribly dated, isn't it?

383
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:59,650
I'm thinking shelves
up to the ceiling

384
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,527
and some good reading lamps.

385
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,780
Perhaps some wall fixtures
that extend.

386
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:08,200
Father always keeps
the curtains drawn.

387
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:12,413
This to protect the books
from the sunlight.

388
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,456
We are south-facing here.

389
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:16,500
Sure.

390
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,879
- What's your budget?
- What's your estimate?

391
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:23,674
Depends on the materials.

392
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,845
Well, make it
of reasonable quality.

393
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:31,765
Perhaps a nice place
for him to sit and read as well?

394
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:35,769
A good chair or a bench for him
against the window.

395
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,739
You want for us to replace that?

396
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,200
If there's time, why not?

397
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:53,787
A branch fell on it during
a nasty storm last summer.

398
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:57,708
Tropical depression,
I think they called it.

399
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,796
Keep it below $1,000, can you?

400
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,132
My sister and I
are splitting it.

401
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:08,177
I don't want
any unexpected add-ons.

402
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:11,972
Don't worry.
We'll come in on budget.

403
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,059
You want all this done
by next Friday, right?

404
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:17,436
Thursday night, preferably.

405
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:21,148
I can't be here during the week,
but the staff can let you in.

406
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,151
If anything comes up,
have them ring me at the office.

407
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,111
If it's to be finished
on Thursday,

408
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:30,908
we need extra hands.
Including materials, glass...

409
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,287
It's $2,000.

426
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,682
OK.

427
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:40,144
You should have seen him
talking up the prices.

428
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:42,312
I was ready to settle at 450.

429
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:43,856
- I was not doing that.
- You were.

430
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:46,400
I was not. I was telling him
how much it will cost.

431
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:50,654
No, I... I thought he was going
to blow it for us.

432
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,865
<i>But you held your ground.</i>

433
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:56,201
<i>And that's what makes you</i>
<i>professional.</i>

434
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:01,623
<i>I hope it is not only that.</i>

435
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,710
She's so beautiful.

436
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:07,629
Look at her.
She has that red dress

437
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:11,133
and it's the same as...
colour as her lips.

438
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:15,596
Dance with her.

439
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,807
Dance with her.

440
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,642
- I don't want to dance.
- Go on.

441
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,519
- I don't... I don't...
- Come on.

442
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,229
I don't want to. No, thank you.

443
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:25,564
He doesn't want to.

444
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,941
Don't make her...
Don't make her wait.

445
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,276
Dance with her.

446
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:33,947
It's her favourite song.
It's her favourite song.

447
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,618
We'll do it together,
I'll show you the steps.

448
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:38,952
Dance with her.

449
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,456
Dance with her, dance with her.
She wants you to.

450
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,374
- It's her favourite song.
- Attila.

451
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,876
It's her favourite song.

452
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:50,255
Go on. Dance with her. Don't...

453
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,799
She's waiting for you.

454
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:54,593
- She's waiting for you.
- OK, OK, I'll dance.

455
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,347
All right.

456
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,849
- Don't.
- Yeah!

457
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,184
- Idiot.
- Go on!

458
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,435
Get off.

459
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:07,981
♪ <i>Someone kind ♪</i>

You see?

469
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,021
Like riding a bicycle.

470
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,401
Tricycle.

471
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,822
Family.

472
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:00,075
A bike for children.

473
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,787
Children!

474
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,884
You missed the toilet.

475
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:33,734
What?

476
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:37,321
Better than the carpet,
I suppose.

477
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:43,327
When do you expect your wife
might join you, Mr Tóth?

478
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:48,874
There's not room for the both
of you in that storage space.

479
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:55,756
I wish I knew, Audrey.

480
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,600
Thank you for the dinner.

481
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,314
Attila showed me
magazine pictures.

482
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,233
The projects you did
at your firm.

483
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:20,155
You're not what I expected
from what I read about you.

484
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:26,203
I'm not what <i>I</i> expected either.

485
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:33,543
You know,
I'm sure you could get a job.

486
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:37,589
A better job.

487
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:41,051
At a firm here.

488
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,230
I then...

489
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:58,318
would be working for someone.

490
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:04,324
It's better than sleeping
in a storage closet.

491
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,544
I'll look for somewhere else
to stay.

492
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:26,930
Thank you again for the dinner.

493
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,709
Bring the boxes.
Don't drop them.

494
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,169
Here, here, here.

495
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,256
The guy is rich,
he's gonna buy more books.

496
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,508
You be respectful.

497
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:07,054
The guy likes to read.
He can tell us a bedtime story.

498
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:10,182
OK.
Slowly, slowly. Slowly.

499
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,518
Slowly.

500
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,187
Don't scratch the floor.

501
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,333
<i>Yes, the long panels.</i>

502
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,126
<i>The shelves can vary in height</i>

503
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,961
<i>to accommodate</i>
<i>the larger volumes</i>

504
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:42,089
<i>our client had been stacking</i>
<i>on the floor.</i>

505
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:44,299
So, 45 degrees.

506
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:47,094
Three, two, one.

507
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:57,854
Perfect. It will be beautiful.

508
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,241
That's it.
That's good, that's good.

509
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:15,622
Left, Gordon, left. And steady.

510
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:18,208
Careful now, left.

511
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,210
One steady movement.

512
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,212
Come on, one steady movement.

513
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,673
Slowly.

514
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,508
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

515
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,260
It's too close to the roof!

516
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,303
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

517
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,307
Oh, no!

518
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:40,981
- I told you to pull!
- I did what I could.

519
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:44,609
We have a piece of guttering
to replace now as well.

520
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,282
One, two, three.

521
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:02,335
Yeah.

522
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:07,007
OK.

523
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,261
Put it... bring your hand...

524
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:27,569
It's good. It's good, it's good.

525
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,655
Dance with me.
Dance with me again.

526
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,277
Attila.

527
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,488
Come. Come.

528
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,410
It's a first edition.

529
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:00,203
They're all first edition.

530
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,417
You're an idiot.

531
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,210
Stop it. Idiot.

532
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,218
What is this?

533
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:17,971
What is all this?

534
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,432
Who authorised you to come
into my home

535
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:22,225
and tear everything apart?

536
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,520
- Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
- Who the hell are you?

537
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,399
This was all
supposed to be a surprise.

538
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,192
Your son Harry told us
not to expect you...

539
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:32,610
It <i>is</i> a goddamn surprise!

540
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:34,362
My mother, an ailing woman,

541
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:35,905
is sitting outside
on the driveway

542
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:37,782
too frightened to come inside.

543
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:39,326
We're sorry
to have frightened her.

544
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:42,037
We brought her here
for some peace and respite,

545
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:45,832
only to discover a strange Negro
man roaming around our property.

546
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:49,753
Your son...
asked us to come here

547
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:53,173
to redo the study
into a library.

548
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:56,009
A library?

549
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,346
The room...

550
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,973
it's gutted!

551
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,977
Well, we were just putting
everything back in its place.

552
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,354
You've turned it all inside out.

553
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:09,564
How do you know
its proper place?

554
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,525
We have taken excellent care
of your belongings,

555
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,610
Mr Van Buren.

556
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:16,321
I...
I don't know what to tell you.

557
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,199
Who are you?

558
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:21,743
László Tóth.

559
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:26,539
László's a licensed architect.

560
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,583
He supervised the renovation

561
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,336
and I've done business
with your son before.

562
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:35,006
I have a furniture shop
down in Kensington.

563
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,466
Miller and Sons.

564
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,469
Mr Van Buren, may I show you
around the space?

565
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,639
The... the work lamps are not
doing the work any justice.

566
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,766
Your Negro man is waiting
for you outside the gate.

567
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:47,143
I suggest you pack your things
and leave.

568
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,818
Mr Van Buren...

569
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:58,738
we are finished here.

570
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,575
It's quite all right. Come.

571
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:07,705
I will confirm this with my son
in the morning.

572
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,583
My mother is sick.

573
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,253
She needs to be inside
so she can sleep!

574
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,839
It's quite all right?!

575
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:20,009
This is not all right,
this is my home!

576
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:21,761
Goddamn you!

577
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:00,550
Wake up.

578
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,972
That's a hell of a way
to greet the day.

579
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:08,224
What is it?

580
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:18,193
Harry Lee called.

581
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:20,945
He says he won't pay.

582
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:29,787
For... for the materials?

583
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:34,959
He says we damaged the property

584
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:37,253
and I'm lucky if he doesn't
take me to court.

585
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,763
Got nothing to say to that?

586
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,184
What are you going
to do about it?

587
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:55,480
László...

588
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:57,982
I take you into my home,

589
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:02,529
into my place of business,
and this is how you thank me?

590
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:07,200
You run my clients out the door.

591
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:13,623
You make a pass at my wife.

592
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:18,253
She told me.
Of course she told me.

593
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:22,840
Of course she told me.
What do you expect?

594
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:26,094
Well, what did I expect?

595
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:29,264
You couldn't keep your hands to
yourself even when we were kids.

596
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:35,144
Listen.
I won't tell Erzsi this time.

597
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:41,317
I know
you've been through a lot.

598
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,071
That's what I told Audrey too.

599
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,872
I'm not going to hurt you.

600
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,543
But I can't help you anymore
either.

601
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:01,588
You got that?

602
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:22,984
<i>Erzsébet,</i>

603
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:25,903
<i>I can be reached by mail</i>
<i>at a new address...</i>

604
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:27,572
{\an8}

605
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:29,824
<i>I wait for you. I wait and wait.</i>

606
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:34,662
<i>Do you need money?</i>
<i>What do you need?</i>

607
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,164
<i>Yours, László.</i>

608
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:38,833
<i>Good morning, Philadelphia.</i>

609
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,711
<i>It is Thursday</i>
<i>November 7th, 1950.</i>

610
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,547
<i>This could be the first time</i>
<i>since 1930</i>

611
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:47,091
<i>that the Republican Party</i>
<i>may seize control...</i>

612
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,426
Gordon.

613
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:50,637
Gordon.

614
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:55,558
<i>US and United Nations forces</i>
<i>have made significant advances</i>

615
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,602
<i>on the Korean peninsula...</i>

616
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,025
Wake up. Gordon.

617
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:06,861
Come on.

618
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:08,738
Wake up.

619
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:31,928
We gotta go. I let you sleep in.
Time to get up.

620
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:41,979
Oh. Gordon.

621
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:45,441
Has Mr László already gone?
I need to speak with him.

622
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:47,652
Hold on.

623
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,498
Hey, there.

624
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:15,179
László?

625
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,686
It is for my injury.

626
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:24,230
Sister Elizabeth
is asking for you.

627
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:29,360
I will be right there.

628
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:34,157
Do me a favour and hold off on
that until we punch the clock.

629
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,426
What did she want
to talk to you about?

630
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,720
She asked for my
participation.

631
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:57,972
Like what?
They want you to help out?

632
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,391
I already help out.

633
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:05,646
She wants me to attend
the service on Sundays

634
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:08,274
and collect donations.

635
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:11,194
And what did you say to her?

636
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:15,865
I said I would think about it.

637
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:17,784
That seems fair, no?

638
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:24,665
I go to somewhere else.

639
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:30,421
Why don't you ask
for a place to stay,

640
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:32,840
wherever it is that you do go?

641
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:40,640
I do not permit my people from
home to see me as a beggar.

642
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,391
Never.

There's a son
of a bitch here to see you.

659
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:22,074
László Tóth, is that you?

660
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,076
I've been looking for you.

661
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,748
No wonder I couldn't find you,
you've grown a beard.

662
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,088
What can I do for you, sir?

663
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,007
I would like to take you
to lunch.

664
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,638
We do not break
for another two hours.

665
00:53:43,763 --> 00:53:46,974
Point out your manager.
Let me educate him.

666
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,976
Have you seen that?

667
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:55,232
I can assure you
everyone else has.

668
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:57,318
Flip to page 66.

669
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,163
Where did you study?

670
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:12,708
Bauhaus in Dessau.

671
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:16,379
Bauhaus? How marvellous.

672
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,466
Uh, read the caption
below the photograph.

673
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:27,932
So what do you think?

674
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:31,352
Looks good.

675
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:33,145
Damn right it does.

676
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,023
Why didn't you defend yourself

677
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:39,318
when I came after you all
like a bat out of hell?

678
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:42,738
I called that American cousin
of yours, um...

679
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:45,116
- Attila.
- Yes. Yeah, that's right.

680
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:47,618
First, I apologised,
then I lauded him with praise.

681
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:52,164
However, he, quite honourably,
redirected me to you.

682
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:55,751
And I have since
done my homework.

683
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:01,757
These are yours, yes?

684
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:16,856
Yes.

685
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:18,357
All of them?

686
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,073
Yes.

687
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:30,077
I'm sorry.
Have... have I upset you?

688
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:31,537
No.

689
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:34,957
Not at all.

690
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:42,256
I did not realise these images
were still available.

691
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:45,051
Much less of any consequence.

692
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:48,345
May I keep these?

693
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:50,806
Of course you may.

694
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,768
They're very artistic.

695
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:58,481
They're better in real life.

696
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:02,485
You could've elaborated a little
more on your background.

697
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:03,819
You didn't...

698
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,363
You didn't do yourself
any favours back there.

699
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,659
It was difficult to interject
amidst all of the shouting.

700
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:13,746
Yeah.

701
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,165
Yeah, I... I'm ashamed.

702
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,877
Really, I am, I...

703
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,545
I acted a fool.

704
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,090
My...

705
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:27,718
My mother was dying.

706
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:31,889
It's not an excuse, but she died
that very weekend at the house.

707
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:35,935
I'm very sorry
to hear about your mother.

708
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:40,106
Tell me, why is an accomplished
foreign architect

709
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:42,691
shovelling coal
here in Philadelphia?

710
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:48,030
Well, I'm also
doing the construction

711
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,074
for a bowling alley.

712
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:53,661
But, um...

713
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:03,712
The Reich rejected myself
and my colleagues

714
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:05,756
for our type of work.

715
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:10,136
For it was deemed
not Germanic in character.

716
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:15,558
Uh, I don't wish to be rude,

717
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:18,185
but I only have time
for the coffee.

718
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:22,481
You were not prepared
for what you saw.

719
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,066
That is understandable.

720
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:29,655
I'm glad
you have come to appreciate it.

721
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:34,994
I don't just appreciate it,
Mr Tóth. I cherish it.

722
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,498
I hate surprises.

723
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:41,876
My fat-headed son
should have known better.

724
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:45,588
But listen, I'm not here
to boast or to grieve.

725
00:57:45,713 --> 00:57:48,090
I've come to pay you the monies
you're owed.

726
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:52,970
For what it's worth,
it was not my suggestion

727
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:54,847
you and your partner
should not be paid.

728
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,849
I only found out about that
after the fact.

729
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:01,145
We damaged some guttering
which we intended to replace,

730
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,022
but it was a misunderstanding.

731
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:04,523
Forget it. Take the money.

732
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,612
Thank you.

733
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,409
I'd stash that in your
undergarments, if I were you,

734
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,286
or inside of a shoe.

735
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:22,082
I would like you to come
and see it in the daylight.

736
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:25,628
I've already seen it.

737
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:29,215
I'd like you to come
and enjoy it, rather.

738
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:33,385
- All right.
- Wonderful.

739
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,679
I can have a car come
and pick you up Sunday morning

740
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:38,515
if you're...
if you're not too busy.

741
00:58:38,641 --> 00:58:39,642
No.

742
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:43,938
Here.
Write me down your address.

743
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:00,371
I've found our conversation
persuasive

744
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:03,374
and intellectually stimulating.

745
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,001
Bye.

746
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:08,295
It was a pleasure.

747
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:15,195
Hey, hey, don't move too much.

748
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,494
Going to be some minutes!

749
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,663
One second. Hold this.

750
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:14,838
Yes, he's inside.

751
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,590
Everybody left.
It's time to go. We're closed.

752
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:18,509
Don't push!
I know he is in there.

753
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:19,676
Ain't nobody in there.

754
01:01:19,802 --> 01:01:21,470
My friend would not leave me!
Please.

755
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:23,305
Ain't nobody in there!
It's time to go.

756
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:24,807
- No! No.
- We're closed.

757
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:26,517
Now go on home.

758
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:29,645
Listen, my friend is in there,
please!

759
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,564
- Oh! My nose!
- I said go home.

760
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:32,791
Hey, mister, the picture's
over. You can't sleep here.

761
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:35,377
<i>This demand is for</i>
<i>these derivatives of opium,</i>

762
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:37,045
<i>- the narcotic drugs...</i>

763
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:38,213
<i>..useful in medicine</i>

764
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:40,757
<i>to relieve pain</i>
<i>and to induce sleep.</i>

765
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:42,551
<i>Used without supervision,</i>

766
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:46,221
<i>they can become dangerous,</i>
<i>habit-forming drugs.</i>

767
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:48,599
<i>Once the habit is formed,</i>
<i>the addict...</i>

768
01:02:48,724 --> 01:02:50,726
What? What?

769
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:53,061
<i>.. must have a continual</i>
<i>supply at all costs.</i>

770
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:55,314
<i>Lawfully imported drugs</i>
<i>are not available to him.</i>

771
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:57,107
<i>He must turn</i>
<i>to an illegal source.</i>

772
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:58,400
Come.

773
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:00,652
Come with me.

774
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:03,280
Good kitty. Come with me.

775
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:07,242
- Just come.
- Excuse me, Mr Tóth.

776
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:11,038
The Van Buren family
sent me for you.

777
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:26,470
On the seat there beside you,
there's a pressed dinner jacket.

778
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,451
There you are!

779
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:54,081
Man of the hour.

780
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:57,751
What have you done to yourself?

781
01:03:57,876 --> 01:03:59,294
Fell off a beam and...

782
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:02,422
- Everyone's famished.
- Harry, you remember each other.

783
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:05,384
Yes, I do. Afternoon.

784
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:08,720
Daddy, the kitchen's asking if
we could please take our seats.

785
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,265
And this is Harry's twin sister,
Maggie.

786
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:14,184
Hello, Mr Tóth.
We love the library.

787
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:15,644
Thank you.

788
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:17,020
All right, let's eat.

789
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:19,898
He won't tout
his own accomplishments, but...

790
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,775
Mr Tóth's work is celebrated

791
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,903
throughout much of Western
and Central Europe.

792
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:29,992
There are many features on him
in architectural journals,

793
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:32,536
if you follow
that sort of thing.

794
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:34,162
What was your focus?

795
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:45,132
Uh, theatres, synagogues,
restorations.

796
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:50,387
Many projects
but some quite unusual.

797
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:52,514
Are you married, Mr Tóth?

798
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:56,101
Yes.

799
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:00,981
She's still in Europe.

800
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:03,150
Why's that?

801
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:08,447
We were separated.

802
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:10,616
Forcibly.

803
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:17,039
Where is it you come from,
if you don't mind my asking?

804
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:19,374
I... I can't place the accent.

805
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:21,543
The city of Budapest.

806
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:27,341
Ravaged during the war.
Just terrible.

807
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,177
What was it like, the war?

808
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:33,680
We hear some stories here
that make one's toes curl.

809
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:41,438
I would not know where to begin,
Mrs Hoffman.

810
01:05:43,023 --> 01:05:45,859
Do you plan on
returning to Europe, Mr Tóth?

811
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:57,996
But my wife, she tries to come
now, here, to join me.

812
01:05:59,081 --> 01:06:01,750
But the situation is difficult.

813
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,710
Well, with Roosevelt gone now,

814
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:06,129
that should make things easier.

815
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:10,217
He is gone,
but everyone is still frightened

816
01:06:10,342 --> 01:06:14,763
that people like me are a threat
to their national defence.

817
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:20,686
When you say "people",
you mean Jews?

818
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:24,981
We're Jewish.

819
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,902
Michelle converted.

820
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:36,702
As did my Erzsébet.

821
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:41,748
It required a great
deal of commitment and study,

822
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:44,209
but...

823
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:47,003
..few at home
recognised her for it.

824
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:51,216
A pity the National Socialists
could not see it their way.

825
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:55,679
But no, not only Jewish.

826
01:06:55,804 --> 01:06:58,265
Foreign people.

827
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:03,937
I was fortunate to depart
from Bremerhaven when I did.

828
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:10,026
Truman's order facilitated
the transfer of my group.

829
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:14,030
Others were not so lucky.

830
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:19,286
That sounds
very painful, László.

831
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:21,329
We're terribly sorry for you.

832
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:27,169
Michael is my friend
and my attorney, in that order.

833
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:31,757
Michael, is this a process your
firm could help to expedite?

834
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:35,302
It is not so simple, I'm afraid.

835
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:43,226
My wife cannot leave my niece
behind because she is...

836
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:48,190
young, motherless,
and is very sick.

837
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:51,359
It's just the two of 'em?

838
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:56,156
I'd be glad to make an enquiry
on your behalf.

839
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:59,785
There's something called
the Displaced Persons Act

840
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:02,746
that's recently
gone into effect.

841
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:06,082
It will allow some
200,000 European persons

842
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:09,377
admission
for permanent residence.

843
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:11,129
You can read about it
in the paper now.

844
01:08:12,214 --> 01:08:15,383
Michael's firm represents the
office of the Vice President.

845
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:19,638
The President?

846
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:21,056
Of the United States.

847
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:24,017
Congratulations.

848
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:27,979
Come see me in our
Philadelphia office on Monday.

849
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:32,192
Telephone this line,
and my assistant can arrange.

850
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:35,403
She'll tell you what
we'll need you both to provide.

851
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:39,157
Thank you.

852
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,368
You're welcome.

853
01:08:41,493 --> 01:08:44,329
I think we'll take
coffee in the study, huh?

854
01:08:49,918 --> 01:08:51,044
Thank you.

855
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:57,926
I was married once.

856
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:01,638
She gave me
two beautiful children.

857
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:06,351
Nevertheless, my mother
Margaret, and the twins

858
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:07,519
demanded my attention

859
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:10,063
every minute
of my scarce personal time.

860
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:14,985
Things became awkward
between my ex-wife and Margaret

861
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,820
so we separated.

862
01:09:16,945 --> 01:09:18,697
Amicably.

863
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:20,866
Margaret raised me on her own
in Rochester.

864
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:22,367
It was just the two of us.

865
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:28,290
Her parents had disowned her
for a child out of wedlock.

866
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:33,211
She was my only real family,

867
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:36,798
other than the twins
later on in life, of course.

868
01:09:39,009 --> 01:09:43,513
I tell you,
shortly before their death,

869
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:45,599
my mother's parents,

870
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:48,268
I hesitate to call them
my grandparents,

871
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:52,105
they reached out to Margaret
and me after reading an article

872
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:55,150
on the reported success
of my first company.

873
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:58,069
In actual fact,

874
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,822
we weren't doing that well
at the time

875
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,532
and would soon
shutter our doors,

876
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:05,327
but this was not yet
public knowledge.

877
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:15,211
I gather you conclude from our
prior interactions I am blunt,

878
01:10:15,337 --> 01:10:18,965
not hyperbolic
or particularly sentimental.

879
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:23,345
But my mother...

880
01:10:26,348 --> 01:10:29,142
she was defenceless
against their chumminess.

881
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:32,520
She argued that they could
very well be sick or dying

882
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:36,733
and... quite likely
needed the money.

883
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:42,822
I didn't like seeing Margaret,
an ordinarily pragmatic woman,

884
01:10:42,948 --> 01:10:45,825
reduced to such
bromidic assumptions.

885
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:48,078
Still, I agreed
to meet with them in person,

886
01:10:48,203 --> 01:10:49,788
in part to appease her,

887
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:53,500
but also to satisfy
the curiosities of my lineage.

888
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:57,379
Do you know,
it really is very clever.

889
01:10:57,504 --> 01:11:01,549
The way the space surrounds one,
the forced perspective.

890
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:03,176
I think so, yes.

891
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:06,554
It reminds me
of a short story I once read.

892
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,807
It's about
a never-ending library.

893
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:11,434
Are you working on anything
at the moment, Mr Tóth?

894
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:14,729
A bowling alley.

895
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,606
Pardon me,
I was just in the middle

896
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:18,191
of telling our friend here
a story.

897
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:21,778
I'm so sorry. Not at all.
Please excuse me.

898
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:31,997
You agreed to see them.

899
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,292
We exchanged
pleasantries over the telephone

900
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:37,711
and I offered to meet with them

901
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:39,337
at their modest
apartment residence

902
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,798
in a neighbouring town.

903
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:45,385
I laughed to realise they'd been
so nearby all those years.

904
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,637
On the drive over...

905
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:51,224
I had time to think.

906
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:53,685
And I finally arrived
at a figure

907
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,646
I felt comfortable
in offering the two of them,

908
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:59,524
seeing that they were,
whether I liked it or not,

909
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:02,277
our only living relatives.

910
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:04,654
I was received hospitably,

911
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:08,783
so I swiftly moved to explain
I'd made them out a cheque

912
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:11,077
for the amount of $25,000.

913
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:15,498
When I handed it over,
they appeared relieved,

914
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:17,959
but perhaps a little
disappointed at the figure.

915
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:21,296
They were courteous
and thanked me all the same.

916
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:24,257
I was quite uncomfortable.

917
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:30,388
But before hurrying off,
I asked them a question.

918
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:34,267
What will you do
with all this money?

919
01:12:36,478 --> 01:12:39,522
They rambled on about miracles
or some such thing.

920
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:42,484
For a moment, everything
in their immediate line of view

921
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:45,695
seemed solvable, achievable.

922
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,155
They would finally be all right

923
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,367
and what a thoughtful grandson
I was.

924
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,287
Upon departure,

925
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,249
before I even reached
the edge of their front lawn,

926
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,377
the two of them came
running out after me, shouting.

927
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:05,465
"You've forgotten
your signature, Harrison."

928
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:09,385
I summoned the courage
to be frank

929
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:11,179
and to speak to them as adults.

930
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:13,723
I had not forgotten, I said,

931
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:15,809
but was not ultimately compelled
to sign

932
01:13:15,934 --> 01:13:18,436
due to the blunder
of their response.

933
01:13:22,941 --> 01:13:24,776
They took it as such a shock.

934
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:26,611
I thought for a moment
it might kill them

935
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,029
right there on the front lawn.

936
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:31,032
But the two of them just wept
and came apart like beggars.

937
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:35,995
The whole thing was so much more
disturbing than I'd imagined.

938
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:40,333
And so on condition

939
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:44,337
that they let Margaret alone
from then on,

940
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:49,217
I struck them a separate cheque
for $500 and I signed.

941
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:55,140
That is how much
I loved my mother, Mr Tóth.

942
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:58,184
We did things for each other.

943
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,520
What could they expect

944
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,647
after the way
they had treated you both?

945
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:05,400
Yes, yes,
that's exactly how I see it.

946
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:07,360
Answer me something.

947
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,613
Why architecture?

948
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,827
Is it a test?

949
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:19,080
No, it is not.

950
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:32,010
Nothing
is of its own explanation.

951
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:41,227
Is there a better description
of a cube

952
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:43,605
than that of its construction?

953
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:48,902
There was a war on.

954
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:53,239
And yet
it is my understanding that...

955
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:59,120
many of the sites of my projects
have survived.

956
01:14:59,954 --> 01:15:03,458
They remain there
still in the city.

957
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:11,216
When the terrible recollections
of what happened in Europe

958
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:12,842
cease to humiliate us,

959
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:20,642
I expect for them to serve
instead as a political stimulus,

960
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:24,145
sparking the upheavals
that so frequently occur

961
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:27,607
in the cycles of peoplehood.

962
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:43,039
I already anticipate a communal
rhetoric of anger and fear.

963
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:51,214
A whole river of such
frivolities may flow undammed.

964
01:15:56,636 --> 01:16:01,599
But my buildings were devised
to endure such erosion

965
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:03,643
of the Danube's shoreline.

966
01:16:09,274 --> 01:16:11,234
What a poetic reply.

967
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:16,698
You must have been
a beloved professor.

968
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:23,371
I've said it before,
but I find our conversations...

969
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:26,541
intellectually stimulating.

970
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:30,336
I agree with you.

971
01:16:34,716 --> 01:16:37,510
Everyone, please.

972
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:41,472
Take your brandy
and join me outside.

973
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:44,350
I have a terrific surprise.

974
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:52,317
Where the hell
are you taking us, Harrison?

975
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:53,568
It's freezing out here.

976
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:55,653
Try doing this
in heels, Michael.

977
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:09,083
Only a little further. Come on.

978
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:15,048
Bear with us, everyone.

979
01:17:17,425 --> 01:17:19,552
Hold your horses,
we're almost there.

980
01:17:44,494 --> 01:17:45,328
All right.

981
01:17:47,455 --> 01:17:49,082
As many of you know,

982
01:17:49,207 --> 01:17:52,168
this past year
has been somewhat difficult

983
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:54,587
for Harry, Maggie and myself.

984
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:57,632
Daddy, it's very cold out here.
Shall we go back inside?

985
01:17:57,757 --> 01:17:59,926
Maggie, please. Quiet.

986
01:18:02,303 --> 01:18:05,598
I've brought you all out here
this evening in the cold

987
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:08,684
not to glance over my shoulder
at the past,

988
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:13,940
but to join me in looking
forward toward the future.

989
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,902
As you know,
over this rise is Doylestown.

990
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:23,825
And so on this site, we plan to
build a centre for the community

991
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:26,452
in the name
of Margaret Lee Van Buren.

992
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,414
Harrison, that's lovely.

993
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:32,875
This shall be
a sacred enough space

994
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,003
that perhaps her soul
might inhabit it.

995
01:18:36,129 --> 01:18:41,050
A place for gathering,
reflecting, learning.

996
01:18:42,343 --> 01:18:46,180
And, Mr Tóth, I would like you
to build this for her.

997
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:49,058
Something boundless,
something new.

998
01:18:50,268 --> 01:18:52,520
This has shocked you, I see.
I'm delighted.

999
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:54,897
I thought perhaps
you might see it coming.

1000
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:57,442
No. No.

1001
01:18:57,567 --> 01:18:59,652
Listen.

1002
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:03,781
It is no coincidence
that fate brought us together

1003
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,325
on the eve of my mother's death.

1004
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:10,246
I'm good at reading the signs.

1005
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,750
Sir, I do not know
what the commission entails.

1006
01:19:14,876 --> 01:19:16,377
We'll talk about the details
at home,

1007
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:17,837
but you'll be well compensated.

1008
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:21,716
And also, you'll be given
a place here on the property

1009
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:22,842
to live and work.

1010
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:26,179
I think that residing here

1011
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:28,139
will allow you the time
and the space

1012
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29,891
to conceive of it properly.

1013
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,977
And your family,
should they arrive,

1014
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:35,938
they're welcome here too.

1015
01:19:36,856 --> 01:19:38,274
What do you say?

1016
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:44,113
Well, I-I... uh...

1017
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:48,576
I would like to draw something
and then present it to you.

1018
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:52,246
You'd like to win
the commission.

1019
01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:55,458
All right, you can do that.

1020
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:58,753
It's cold, let's return inside.

1021
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:00,671
Come on.

1022
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:19,774
Excuse me.

1023
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:22,318
I am sorry, I am sorry.

1024
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:25,947
A driver brought me here,
I don't recall his name.

1025
01:20:26,072 --> 01:20:29,700
- Sorry.
- No, I need to get back. I...

1026
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,869
Could someone possibly
contact the man

1027
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:33,829
who dropped me here
this afternoon?

1028
01:20:33,955 --> 01:20:35,414
One minute, please.

1029
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:52,515
Mr Tóth. I'm sorry
to have kept you waiting.

1030
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,810
Harrison's gone to bed.
He wishes you a good night.

1031
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:58,062
Would you help me
to find the driver?

1032
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:03,359
Listen, I'm terribly sorry
about my father's theatrics.

1033
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:06,445
Must have caught you off guard.

1034
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:08,197
It's quite all right.

1035
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:09,657
He often makes these decisions

1036
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:11,617
without consulting
the rest of us.

1037
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:15,204
I did not take any of it
to heart.

1038
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:16,789
Oh, you should.

1039
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,584
You should, you see.

1040
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:24,714
My father would like us
to hire you.

1041
01:21:26,465 --> 01:21:27,466
Oh.

1042
01:21:35,182 --> 01:21:37,351
Ah.

1043
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:43,107
I don't have any infrastructure
here.

1044
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:44,400
That's why he's asked me

1045
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:46,527
to oversee and assist you
in this endeavour.

1046
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:49,739
I have no idea
of the parameters.

1047
01:21:49,864 --> 01:21:55,536
Once I have distilled the
essence of Father's outburst,

1048
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,913
I'll try and make
some economic sense of it.

1049
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:00,666
We've quite a full house
this evening,

1050
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:02,960
so I took the liberty
of making up a place for you

1051
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:04,295
in the guest house.

1052
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,380
We can have your things sent for
in the morning.

1053
01:22:22,063 --> 01:22:24,857
Mr Tóth?

1054
01:22:25,316 --> 01:22:27,652
Mr Tóth?

1055
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:49,298
One minute.

1056
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:53,177
Sir?

1057
01:22:57,098 --> 01:22:58,391
You rang for me, sir?

1058
01:22:58,516 --> 01:23:01,686
Oh, yes, László, come in.
I've had a vision.

1059
01:23:01,811 --> 01:23:04,855
[♪ "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik IV" ♪
by Mozart)

1060
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,818
I have some sketches.

1061
01:23:08,943 --> 01:23:11,862
I... Also something
I have been working on

1062
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:15,241
which might be applicable here,
if you care to look.

1063
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:18,536
In a moment, my eyes are bleary.
Sit down.

1064
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:24,125
Pardon my appearance, I have...

1065
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:26,711
I have carpenters
in the forehead

1066
01:23:26,836 --> 01:23:28,421
causing a terrible ringing
in my ears.

1067
01:23:28,546 --> 01:23:30,423
You'll have to bear with me.

1068
01:23:30,548 --> 01:23:31,674
I can come back.

1069
01:23:31,799 --> 01:23:35,678
Shh! Before I lose it.
Dreams slip away.

1070
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,180
Yes, I know.

1071
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,769
Doylestown, it's beautiful,

1072
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:46,272
but it's not a cultural place,
you know?

1073
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:50,443
- Sure.
- But it could be.

1074
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:54,321
If there were an auditorium,

1075
01:23:54,447 --> 01:23:57,324
it could host a...
a theatre festival.

1076
01:23:58,576 --> 01:23:59,535
Sure.

1077
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:00,995
And in the off season,
of course,

1078
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,373
the local students
could access it.

1079
01:24:04,498 --> 01:24:06,167
Yes.

1080
01:24:06,292 --> 01:24:08,377
And what do you think
about a gymnasium?

1081
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:11,505
I used to practise wrestling
when I was a teenager.

1082
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:14,592
I have these fond memories
of my mother

1083
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:17,678
accompanying me to matches
in the neighbouring towns.

1084
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:20,556
Perhaps a swimming pool?

1085
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:23,100
I can't swim.

1086
01:24:27,688 --> 01:24:30,441
And perhaps it is too expensive?

1087
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,943
Don't talk to me about money.

1088
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:35,863
<i>Pennsylvania</i>
<i>has more owner-occupied homes</i>

1089
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:37,531
<i>than any other state.</i>

1090
01:24:38,616 --> 01:24:41,577
<i>More small towns</i>
<i>and small cities,</i>

1091
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:45,831
<i>and more people living in small</i>
<i>towns than any other state,</i>

1092
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:49,293
<i>as well as some of the greatest</i>
<i>cities in the world.</i>

1093
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:56,258
<i>All this is why Pennsylvania</i>
<i>is truly a land of decision</i>

1094
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:57,968
<i>for families who want</i>
<i>a wonderful place</i>

1095
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,637
<i>to live and work,</i>

1096
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:02,264
<i>and to enjoy the richness</i>
<i>of leisure</i>

1097
01:25:02,389 --> 01:25:04,642
<i>with nearby secure employment.</i>

1098
01:25:24,954 --> 01:25:26,997
Don't talk to him about money.

1099
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:31,001
I've spoken to our friends at
the Bucks County mayor's office

1100
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:34,713
who are warm to accessing local
and state funding opportunities

1101
01:25:34,839 --> 01:25:37,091
on behalf of our project,

1102
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:41,762
if we are willing
to designate a specific...

1103
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:46,642
and meaningful component
of the centre

1104
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:48,936
for Christian congregation.

1105
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:54,775
But it is a community centre
for all people.

1106
01:25:56,527 --> 01:25:58,487
What do they want,
a prayer room?

1107
01:25:58,612 --> 01:26:01,699
I'm under the impression
they're expecting something

1108
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:06,495
more specific and meaningful
than that for their earmark.

1109
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:08,956
This, and pending their approval

1110
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:11,333
of the overall proposal,
of course.

1111
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:17,131
Excuse me. An auditorium,
a gymnasium, a library.

1112
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:20,050
Father described it more...

1113
01:26:21,135 --> 01:26:24,221
more as a reading room
for the public.

1114
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:32,688
A library and a chapel?

1115
01:26:34,857 --> 01:26:36,984
That is four builds, Harry.

1116
01:26:37,818 --> 01:26:39,695
Four, not one.

1117
01:26:41,155 --> 01:26:42,698
It's ambitious.

1118
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:46,827
And I thought you'd like that.

1119
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,752
I put in a call to our frequent
contractor, Leslie Woodrow.

1120
01:26:55,586 --> 01:26:57,963
We first worked with Leslie

1121
01:26:58,088 --> 01:27:00,215
as one of our ship engineering
officers,

1122
01:27:00,341 --> 01:27:04,261
but he's supervised several
important construction projects

1123
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:07,765
for us since,
including these offices.

1124
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:12,019
My father is allocating a sum
of $850,000 to the project,

1125
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:16,398
which, to me,
seems very reasonable,

1126
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:18,275
if not exorbitant.

1127
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:20,945
If Leslie agrees
to come on board,

1128
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:24,073
then I'll have him start
a budget for us right away.

1129
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:28,160
This allocation of 850,000

1130
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:32,831
is inclusive of fees
for yourself and Leslie.

1131
01:27:33,958 --> 01:27:36,460
Also we've gone ahead
and made arrangements

1132
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:40,714
to start securing you a licence
here in Pennsylvania.

1133
01:27:41,924 --> 01:27:44,802
Well, Harry,
let's start digging.

1134
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:03,696
<i>Erzsébet, I have become</i>
<i>acquainted with an influential American attorney</i>

1135
01:28:03,821 --> 01:28:06,949
<i>who says he can help you</i>
<i>and Zsófia with your situation.</i>

1136
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:10,661
<i>Is there somewhere</i>
<i>we might find a photograph</i>

1137
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:12,663
<i>of you and Zsófia pictured together?</i>

1138
01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:23,007
<i>Anything linking her to you?</i>

1139
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:25,759
<i>I have reached out to colleagues</i>

1140
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:28,095
<i>who sometimes attended parties</i>
<i>at the house.</i>

1141
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,847
<i>I am waiting on return.</i>

1142
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:39,481
<i>Whomever comes to mind, write to them</i>
<i>and explain how urgent this is.</i>

1143
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:43,736
<i>Anything tying her to you,</i>
<i>and you to me,</i>

1144
01:28:43,861 --> 01:28:46,655
<i>can be of great assistance</i>
<i>to Mr Hoffman.</i>

1145
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:51,994
504, 505, 506,

1146
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:55,664
507, 508.

1147
01:28:55,789 --> 01:29:00,502
<i>I have enclosed a list of</i>
<i>items and information requested by his office.</i>

1148
01:29:02,296 --> 01:29:05,883
<i>Please fill out what you can</i>
<i>of these documents</i>

1149
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:08,719
<i>and return these originals</i>
<i>to me at once.</i>

1150
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:16,560
<i>Here: some good fortune</i>
<i>may have fallen upon me.</i>

1151
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:19,229
<i>In an unexpected turn of events,</i>

1152
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:23,817
<i>I have been offered an intriguing</i>
<i>opportunity, a second chance.</i>

1153
01:29:23,942 --> 01:29:27,696
...three, four,

1154
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:31,950
five, six, seven.

1155
01:29:32,076 --> 01:29:35,037
<i>I can feel you nearer to me</i>
<i>now than ever before.</i>

1156
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,124
<i>Your love, László.</i>

1157
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:23,627
Level, level.
Higher, higher.

1158
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:26,964
Little higher. Good.
Good, good, good.

1159
01:30:30,509 --> 01:30:35,722
The total area
is 2,684 square metres

1160
01:30:35,848 --> 01:30:39,810
including a sizeable condensate
system for harvesting rainwater,

1161
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:40,978
below grade.

1162
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:43,689
Narrow openings
you see here and here,

1163
01:30:43,814 --> 01:30:47,943
they are skylights that can also
be viewed as demarcations

1164
01:30:48,068 --> 01:30:52,281
of units of space on either side
of the entrance hall.

1165
01:30:52,406 --> 01:30:55,284
These units are convertible,
multifunctional.

1166
01:30:55,409 --> 01:31:00,622
They offer a total occupancy
of 500 persons on each side.

1167
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:04,918
Bespoke systems
for seating and storage

1168
01:31:05,043 --> 01:31:11,633
allow for a conference,
gymnasium, auditorium.

1169
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:16,138
These rooms of a more standard
size are pre-cast concrete.

1170
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:19,224
The chapel at the heart
of the building

1171
01:31:19,349 --> 01:31:21,476
contrasted by an altarpiece
of marble

1172
01:31:21,602 --> 01:31:22,936
from the mountains of Carrara...

1173
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:24,229
I can't see.

1174
01:31:24,354 --> 01:31:26,023
..will serve as the institute's
centrepiece.

1175
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:28,066
Harry, what do you
think about the gymnasium

1176
01:31:28,192 --> 01:31:29,443
being off to the side like that?

1177
01:31:29,568 --> 01:31:31,195
I'm not sure.

1178
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,988
I think it looks like
a barracks.

1179
01:31:33,113 --> 01:31:35,782
Well, that's perhaps because
you never enlisted, Harry.

1180
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:39,870
I think it's all
a great surprise. Keep going.

1181
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:41,788
Let me demonstrate.

1182
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:49,171
When the sun travels
from east to west,

1183
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:55,385
wooden beams located
at the base of the towers

1184
01:31:55,510 --> 01:32:00,307
will unite to form the symbol
of a cross upon the altarpiece,

1185
01:32:01,225 --> 01:32:02,893
when they are illuminated.

1186
01:32:03,018 --> 01:32:05,562
Extraordinary.

1187
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:06,730
How wonderful.

1188
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:09,149
Maggie, will you call
for some coffee?

1189
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:12,361
I think it's beautiful, Mr Tóth.

1190
01:32:12,486 --> 01:32:13,820
Thank you.

1191
01:32:14,488 --> 01:32:16,448
Well, what's the height
of those things?

1192
01:32:16,573 --> 01:32:19,243
Six or seven metres also?

1193
01:32:19,368 --> 01:32:21,703
And did I understand you
correctly,

1194
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:26,083
over 800,000 square feet
of surface area?

1195
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:31,046
Well, if we can afford these
materials at all, Mr Van Buren.

1196
01:32:31,171 --> 01:32:34,132
Sylacauga marble
ships out of Talladega County,

1197
01:32:34,258 --> 01:32:36,093
and that might be possible

1198
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:38,387
if I manage to swing
a few favours.

1199
01:32:38,512 --> 01:32:41,056
With all due respect,
afford the materials?

1200
01:32:41,848 --> 01:32:45,727
Sir, concrete
is sturdy and cheap.

1201
01:32:45,852 --> 01:32:49,648
Concrete?
It's not very attractive.

1202
01:32:50,482 --> 01:32:53,193
Perhaps we could split
the difference on materials.

1203
01:32:57,614 --> 01:32:59,533
Fortunately,
the building's aesthetic

1204
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:01,994
is not yours to resolve,
Mr Woodrow.

1205
01:33:03,537 --> 01:33:08,709
And Sylacauga marble is white,
like a sheet of paper.

1206
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:13,130
What I have here is blue
and grey with a softer veining.

1207
01:33:13,255 --> 01:33:15,465
I prefer the Italian.
It's more suitable.

1208
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,635
Well, I'll have to do
some research but...

1209
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,054
I know someone talented.

1210
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:24,349
An Italian mason whom I have
commissioned before.

1211
01:33:24,474 --> 01:33:26,768
Oh, another detail
before I forget. The name.

1212
01:33:27,978 --> 01:33:30,272
I want to make sure
it's visible, yeah.

1213
01:33:30,397 --> 01:33:33,984
Sir, is this really
what you imagined?

1214
01:33:34,693 --> 01:33:36,445
Am I missing something?

1215
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:37,779
When Harry called,

1216
01:33:37,904 --> 01:33:40,282
he described this to me
as a personal project.

1217
01:33:40,407 --> 01:33:42,284
If this is what
we ultimately settle on,

1218
01:33:42,409 --> 01:33:43,702
something of this scale,

1219
01:33:43,827 --> 01:33:46,204
the timeline will need to be
considerably adjusted.

1220
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:48,165
I'd rather be alive
at 18 percent

1221
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:50,083
than dead at the prime rate,
Leslie.

1222
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,085
We will not exceed
our allocations.

1223
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:53,545
Your grandmother
loved marble.

1224
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:54,880
I assure you.

1225
01:33:55,005 --> 01:33:56,715
Where are we at
with our discussions

1226
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,091
with the mayor's office?

1227
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:00,010
- They're waiting on us.
- Good.

1228
01:34:01,011 --> 01:34:02,387
Push them along.

1229
01:34:02,512 --> 01:34:03,680
- It's good.
- Thank you.

1230
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:34,669
Shit.

1231
01:34:41,968 --> 01:34:43,845
M-Morning, Leslie.

1232
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:47,057
Don't tell me
you're just now getting up.

1233
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:50,227
Two minutes and I'm ready.

1234
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:53,605
I'll give you three
if you use it to rinse off.

1235
01:34:54,898 --> 01:34:55,982
Three.

1236
01:34:56,817 --> 01:34:58,068
I'll wait outside.

1237
01:35:03,573 --> 01:35:04,825
Big day.

1238
01:35:05,617 --> 01:35:07,077
Big day. Wake up.

1239
01:35:12,374 --> 01:35:14,292
The mayor
hasn't got all day, Leslie.

1240
01:35:14,418 --> 01:35:16,378
We're fine, Harry.

1241
01:35:16,503 --> 01:35:18,505
Will your father be joining us
as well?

1242
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:21,758
No, he's overseas
on business, I'm afraid.

1243
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:23,051
He sends his regards.

1244
01:35:23,176 --> 01:35:25,595
This is a project
he's very passionate about.

1245
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,139
It's a priority for us.

1246
01:35:27,264 --> 01:35:28,974
He asked if he could
telephone you tomorrow

1247
01:35:29,099 --> 01:35:30,267
to talk it all through.

1248
01:35:30,392 --> 01:35:31,893
At your convenience, of course.

1249
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:32,894
Well, sure.

1250
01:35:33,019 --> 01:35:34,354
Sylvia in my office

1251
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:37,107
can set for just about any time
tomorrow afternoon.

1252
01:35:40,694 --> 01:35:41,987
Apologies.

1253
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:47,659
Well, this is, um...
different.

1254
01:35:48,702 --> 01:35:50,245
Very modern.

1255
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:51,997
- Yes.
- All right.

1256
01:35:52,122 --> 01:35:54,374
Walk us through
what you have in mind.

1257
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:56,793
The construction phase alone

1258
01:35:56,918 --> 01:35:59,754
will create upwards
of 80 local jobs.

1259
01:36:00,464 --> 01:36:06,094
Carpenters, painters,
upwards of 150 upon completion,

1260
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:10,474
at which point the facility will
need to be permanently staffed.

1261
01:36:10,599 --> 01:36:13,560
When are you gonna answer
the questions in the box?

1262
01:36:20,442 --> 01:36:21,818
Right.

1263
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:25,655
Right.

1264
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:29,784
I would also like to address

1265
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:34,372
some of the written concerns
and comments

1266
01:36:34,498 --> 01:36:39,419
submitted to us anonymously
ahead of tonight's discussion.

1267
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:45,008
Questions probing
my personal background,

1268
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:50,430
heritage and ideological
persuasion, if you will.

1269
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:55,352
As a foreign person

1270
01:36:56,895 --> 01:37:00,273
and a newcomer to Doylestown,

1271
01:37:00,398 --> 01:37:03,026
I see a community in need.

1272
01:37:04,528 --> 01:37:09,950
And this is my only persuasion
of relevance.

1273
01:37:11,535 --> 01:37:17,582
Mr Van Buren, a generous patron
and practising Protestant,

1274
01:37:17,707 --> 01:37:22,671
and I will build a place
you will be drawn to congregate

1275
01:37:22,796 --> 01:37:25,090
and inspired to worship.

1276
01:37:26,716 --> 01:37:28,009
You may rest assured

1277
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:31,846
that we will honour
the traditions of Doylestown.

1278
01:37:32,514 --> 01:37:38,186
The Margaret Lee Van Buren
Centre for Creation and Activity

1279
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:40,146
will be its manifestation.

1280
01:37:41,273 --> 01:37:46,319
A landmark which proclaims
not only "I am new",

1281
01:37:46,444 --> 01:37:49,197
but "I am part
of the new whole".

1282
01:37:50,073 --> 01:37:53,118
Please to pass the, um...
How do you call it?

1283
01:37:53,243 --> 01:37:55,036
No, the torch.

1284
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,081
Right.

1285
01:38:10,343 --> 01:38:13,179
Here we have
the chapel interior.

1286
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:17,684
It is suitable for 119 persons.

1287
01:38:20,312 --> 01:38:21,771
At dawn.

1288
01:38:23,315 --> 01:38:24,858
At sunset.

1289
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:31,948
- At noon.
- Oh, that's clever.

1290
01:38:52,093 --> 01:38:53,845
<i>One of the most</i>
<i>basic commodities</i>

1291
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:55,347
<i>of the world today,</i>

1292
01:38:55,472 --> 01:38:58,141
<i>and it had its humble</i>
<i>beginnings in a little town</i>

1293
01:38:58,266 --> 01:39:01,519
<i>nestled between the green hills</i>
<i>of Pennsylvania.</i>

1294
01:39:01,645 --> 01:39:03,021
<i>László!</i>

1295
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:07,067
<i>It has taken some months to obtain</i>
<i>the items which Mr Hoffman requested</i>

1296
01:39:07,192 --> 01:39:08,985
<i>since receiving your letter.</i>

1297
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:10,028
<i>Steel.</i>

1298
01:39:10,612 --> 01:39:12,739
<i>I was at a loss at first,</i>

1299
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:18,328
<i>but suddenly thought to contact our</i>
<i>upstairs neighbour in Buda, Mrs Horváth!</i>

1300
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:19,829
<i>Perhaps no one factor</i>

1301
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:22,123
<i>has been of greater importance</i>
<i>in the forward march</i>

1302
01:39:22,248 --> 01:39:25,168
<i>of American progress</i>
<i>than Pennsylvania steel.</i>

1303
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:29,172
<i>She was able to provide</i>
<i>me with several family photographs</i>

1304
01:39:29,297 --> 01:39:32,175
<i>that clearly picture you,</i>
<i>myself, and Zsófia</i>

1305
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,094
<i>with her mother</i>
<i>on our wedding day.</i>

1306
01:39:34,219 --> 01:39:35,303
<i>Steel.</i>

1307
01:39:35,428 --> 01:39:38,306
<i>The poor dear thought us</i>
<i>dead all these years,</i>

1308
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:40,850
<i>so had kept them</i>
<i>on her mantelpiece in memoriam.</i>

1309
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:43,103
<i>Steel for great buildings.</i>

1310
01:39:43,228 --> 01:39:46,106
<i>Steel for bridges.</i>
<i>Steel for motor cars.</i>

1311
01:39:46,231 --> 01:39:49,192
<i>Zsófia could have only</i>
<i>been nine years of age at the time,</i>

1312
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:53,405
<i>but her face and expression</i>
<i>are unmistakable.</i>

1313
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:55,490
<i>Steel for trains</i>
<i>and for rails.</i>

1314
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:57,659
<i>I have included all but</i>
<i>one</i>

1315
01:39:57,784 --> 01:39:59,285
<i>Steel for planes.</i>

1316
01:39:59,411 --> 01:40:01,579
<i>in case this letter</i>
<i>does not reach you.</i>

1317
01:40:02,706 --> 01:40:04,666
<i>I will keep it near my breast,</i>

1318
01:40:04,791 --> 01:40:07,085
<i>our family tree against my heart.</i>

1319
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:10,505
<i>Steel for the guns of</i>
<i>war and the machinery of peace.</i>

1320
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:12,090
<i>László,</i>

1321
01:40:12,215 --> 01:40:14,801
<i>does this mean</i>
<i>we might meet again soon?</i>

1322
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:16,469
<i>Steel.</i>

1323
01:40:16,594 --> 01:40:18,972
<i>Yours, Erzsébet.</i>

1324
01:41:53,358 --> 01:41:55,527
- Right or left?
- On the left.

1325
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:19,092
Could they have walked past us?

1326
01:42:19,217 --> 01:42:22,220
My associate in New York
confirmed they made it on.

1327
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:29,602
Is that them over there?

1328
01:42:31,855 --> 01:42:33,606
No, that is not them.

1329
01:42:35,692 --> 01:42:36,776
Zsófia?

1330
01:42:38,486 --> 01:42:40,738
Zsófia. That is... that is her.

1331
01:42:40,864 --> 01:42:42,031
Zsófia!

1332
01:42:44,492 --> 01:42:45,827
Zsófia!

1333
01:42:54,711 --> 01:42:57,881
What's happened?

1334
01:42:59,007 --> 01:43:04,304
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

1335
01:43:04,429 --> 01:43:05,680
What happened?

1336
01:43:06,306 --> 01:43:07,932
It might not be permanent.

1337
01:43:08,057 --> 01:43:09,809
What happened? Did someone hurt you?

1338
01:43:12,145 --> 01:43:14,731
It's osteoporosis from the famine.

1339
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:20,904
I'll dye my hair. I know it's ugly.

1340
01:43:26,618 --> 01:43:28,828
Where's Attila?

1341
01:43:31,623 --> 01:43:34,208
I did not want him
to be disappointed

1342
01:43:34,334 --> 01:43:37,420
if you were delayed
for any reason.

1343
01:43:42,008 --> 01:43:43,384
Zsófia, dear.

1344
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:46,763
Zsófia.

1345
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:53,645
Welcome to America.

1346
01:43:59,192 --> 01:44:00,151
How wonderful

1347
01:44:00,276 --> 01:44:01,986
to finally make
your acquaintance.

1348
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:03,613
There was a period of time there

1349
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:05,907
where we thought
he had made you up.

1350
01:44:06,032 --> 01:44:08,952
Isn't it fascinating,
meeting the significant others

1351
01:44:09,077 --> 01:44:11,537
of great artists and thinkers?

1352
01:44:11,663 --> 01:44:13,873
Thank you for taking care
of my László.

1353
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:15,917
As persons
of unique privilege,

1354
01:44:16,042 --> 01:44:17,502
I've always thought
it's our duty

1355
01:44:17,627 --> 01:44:21,422
to nurture the defining talents
of our epoch.

1356
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:25,468
I, of course,
am devoid of any such talent.

1357
01:44:25,593 --> 01:44:27,053
Truth be told, I...

1358
01:44:28,972 --> 01:44:31,975
I am incredibly emulous
of individuals like him.

1359
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:33,977
That mustn't be true,
Mr Van Buren.

1360
01:44:34,102 --> 01:44:35,770
You have done very well
for yourself.

1361
01:44:35,895 --> 01:44:37,939
Father's digging
for compliments.

1362
01:44:38,064 --> 01:44:39,649
Don't indulge him.

1363
01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:43,194
- The property is beautiful.
- Isn't it?

1364
01:44:43,319 --> 01:44:44,487
Erzsébet...

1365
01:44:44,612 --> 01:44:47,532
Pardon me,
am I pronouncing that correctly?

1366
01:44:47,657 --> 01:44:50,410
That's fine, just fine.

1367
01:44:50,535 --> 01:44:54,205
Feel free to call me Elizabeth
if you prefer it.

1368
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:56,082
And your English is impressive.

1369
01:44:56,207 --> 01:44:59,961
Thank you. I attended
university in England.

1370
01:45:00,086 --> 01:45:01,838
Oh. Where?

1371
01:45:01,963 --> 01:45:05,258
Oxford. To study English.

1372
01:45:05,383 --> 01:45:08,344
And I returned home
for communications.

1373
01:45:08,469 --> 01:45:10,054
And did you do anything
with that?

1374
01:45:10,179 --> 01:45:14,183
Yes. I worked for a
popular national paper at home,

1375
01:45:14,308 --> 01:45:15,560
<i>Magyar Nemzet.</i>

1376
01:45:15,685 --> 01:45:18,021
Huh.
A journalist. Hmm!

1377
01:45:18,146 --> 01:45:20,523
- Cultural?
- Foreign affairs.

1378
01:45:20,648 --> 01:45:22,775
Well, perhaps
you can help your husband

1379
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:25,486
sound less like
he shines shoes for a wage.

1380
01:45:25,611 --> 01:45:27,196
Haven't you told them anything
about me?

1381
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:30,408
László, how long have you been
here now? Four, five years?

1382
01:45:30,533 --> 01:45:32,535
You have no excuse anymore.

1383
01:45:35,496 --> 01:45:37,749
I'm sorry. I got
a little carried away there.

1384
01:45:37,874 --> 01:45:39,333
Will you please pass that back?

1385
01:45:54,307 --> 01:45:55,933
A penny saved.

1386
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:02,231
Sofia, is that right?

1387
01:46:03,232 --> 01:46:04,317
Zsófia.

1388
01:46:05,193 --> 01:46:06,861
Zsófia.

1389
01:46:06,986 --> 01:46:08,196
Zsófia.

1390
01:46:10,156 --> 01:46:12,033
Does she understand English?

1391
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:13,201
- Yes.
- Yes.

1392
01:46:15,578 --> 01:46:18,581
Yes. She understands very well.

1393
01:46:20,249 --> 01:46:23,878
The woman
behind the man.

1394
01:46:30,718 --> 01:46:33,471
László? May I have a word?

1395
01:46:37,809 --> 01:46:39,060
Yes, sir?

1396
01:46:39,185 --> 01:46:40,353
On Leslie's recommendation,

1397
01:46:40,478 --> 01:46:42,230
we've shown your plans
to another architect.

1398
01:46:42,355 --> 01:46:44,857
What? Who?

1399
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:46,067
Just somebody we worked with

1400
01:46:46,192 --> 01:46:47,735
on the department store
downtown.

1401
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:49,487
These are minor changes.

1402
01:46:49,612 --> 01:46:52,031
Places they thought
we might save a penny.

1403
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:53,366
László?

1404
01:46:53,491 --> 01:46:56,035
- Leslie is a bastard.
- Yes, he is.

1405
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:57,954
That's what we pay him for.

1406
01:46:59,288 --> 01:47:02,083
Ladies...

1407
01:47:14,387 --> 01:47:16,556
I'm sorry for the toys.

1408
01:47:18,099 --> 01:47:21,018
I remembered you as a little girl.

1409
01:47:26,274 --> 01:47:27,984
Look at your mother.

1410
01:47:31,946 --> 01:47:34,949
My sister was beautiful, wasn't she?

1411
01:47:36,784 --> 01:47:41,372
Even when she was ill,
she was so beautiful.

1412
01:48:08,524 --> 01:48:10,401
Are you angry?

1413
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:17,074
Are you angry with me
for not telling you about my condition?

1414
01:48:18,367 --> 01:48:20,661
If you want to start a row
with me,

1415
01:48:20,786 --> 01:48:23,039
I might as well work out
my English.

1416
01:48:23,164 --> 01:48:25,082
Stop it. Your English
is perfectly all right.

1417
01:48:25,208 --> 01:48:30,004
It was an unimaginative joke
he told about you shining shoes.

1418
01:48:35,384 --> 01:48:39,764
Tomorrow,
I will take you to see someone.

1419
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:42,183
A specialist.

1420
01:48:44,227 --> 01:48:46,270
Don't be angry with me.

1421
01:48:52,401 --> 01:48:54,111
Do you not want to be with me
anymore?

1422
01:48:54,237 --> 01:48:56,572
Stop this nonsense.

1423
01:48:57,740 --> 01:48:59,992
Do you think I look older?

1424
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:05,248
We <i>are</i> older.

1425
01:49:05,373 --> 01:49:08,125
Can't you say
anything kind to me?

1426
01:49:08,251 --> 01:49:10,503
I love you, you cow.

1427
01:49:20,805 --> 01:49:22,807
You can touch me.

1428
01:49:26,185 --> 01:49:28,020
I don't want to...

1429
01:49:28,813 --> 01:49:31,649
I don't want to hurt you,
physically.

1430
01:49:34,402 --> 01:49:36,112
You won't.

1431
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:41,242
I had dreams.

1432
01:49:43,577 --> 01:49:46,789
Every night,
I dreamt I was with you.

1433
01:49:49,292 --> 01:49:51,961
I know what you've done, László.

1434
01:49:53,337 --> 01:49:55,798
And it's all right.

1435
01:49:55,923 --> 01:49:58,175
What are you talking about?

1436
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:03,597
I know.

1437
01:50:03,723 --> 01:50:05,933
I know.

1438
01:50:06,058 --> 01:50:09,228
- I can't do it.
- I know everything.

1439
01:50:09,353 --> 01:50:11,439
I don't want to do it right now.

1440
01:50:11,564 --> 01:50:13,399
You see...

1441
01:50:15,109 --> 01:50:16,944
I became sick.

1442
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:20,072
Very sick.

1443
01:50:21,032 --> 01:50:23,534
I could hardly breathe.

1444
01:50:24,327 --> 01:50:29,373
I yearned to be with you
and it made me sick.

1445
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,252
I nearly died.

1446
01:50:34,295 --> 01:50:38,090
Between life and death,

1447
01:50:39,175 --> 01:50:42,720
I began having fantasies
about you.

1448
01:50:43,721 --> 01:50:45,556
But I realised...

1449
01:50:46,682 --> 01:50:52,938
they were not fantasies at all,
but visions.

1450
01:50:56,525 --> 01:50:58,402
I was with you.

1451
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:07,370
All the time, I was with you.

1452
01:51:09,163 --> 01:51:14,668
My László,
I know what you've done.

1453
01:51:14,794 --> 01:51:21,592
I'm not jealous because
I was with you all the time.

1454
01:51:25,638 --> 01:51:30,643
I know everything
that has happened to you.

1455
01:51:32,061 --> 01:51:34,313
And I am here now,

1456
01:51:35,231 --> 01:51:39,276
And I will never leave you.

1457
01:51:41,070 --> 01:51:42,363
Oh, God!

1458
01:51:42,863 --> 01:51:45,032
Oh, my God!

1459
01:51:46,367 --> 01:51:48,327
My love...

1460
01:51:48,452 --> 01:51:51,664
My love, I cannot bear it
anymore!

1461
01:51:51,789 --> 01:51:55,334
- I cannot bear it.
- You can.

1462
01:51:56,419 --> 01:51:58,045
You can.

1463
01:52:02,007 --> 01:52:04,093
We have a new life.

1464
01:52:04,969 --> 01:52:07,054
A new language.

1465
01:52:11,267 --> 01:52:13,477
We can start again.

1466
01:52:37,084 --> 01:52:38,669
Houp-la!

1467
01:52:38,794 --> 01:52:41,338
Pardon. Pardon.

1468
01:52:41,464 --> 01:52:44,341
Maggie Lee
lent me some hair colour.

1469
01:52:44,467 --> 01:52:46,635
That is wonderful, dear.

1470
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:50,848
László, are you there?

1471
01:52:50,973 --> 01:52:52,725
Yes, my love.

1472
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:55,603
The model is beautiful, darling.

1473
01:52:57,229 --> 01:52:59,231
So beautiful.

1474
01:53:00,316 --> 01:53:01,817
Thank you.

1475
01:53:01,942 --> 01:53:04,403
We're going into town
this afternoon to see Attila.

1476
01:53:04,528 --> 01:53:06,363
Would you like to come?

1477
01:53:08,073 --> 01:53:10,910
I have something
this afternoon.

1478
01:53:11,869 --> 01:53:13,245
I cannot.

1479
01:53:17,625 --> 01:53:19,335
I've missed him.

1480
01:53:25,007 --> 01:53:29,929
Just hearing him
mill about in the other room...

1481
01:53:32,932 --> 01:53:34,892
It's fantastic.

1482
01:53:50,741 --> 01:53:53,244
<i>Perhaps we should</i>
<i>see about some language classes</i>

1483
01:53:53,369 --> 01:53:54,745
<i>this afternoon.</i>

1484
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:57,998
You could take the bus in
on your own.

1485
01:53:58,123 --> 01:54:01,210
I'm positive it is the last
place you would like to be,

1486
01:54:01,335 --> 01:54:03,796
but it will be good for you,

1487
01:54:03,921 --> 01:54:07,049
and I can brief the instructor
or whomever

1488
01:54:07,174 --> 01:54:09,301
about your situation.

1489
01:54:09,426 --> 01:54:12,846
Listening to me babble on
will only get you so far.

1490
01:54:19,270 --> 01:54:21,230
Where are you ladies off to?

1491
01:54:21,355 --> 01:54:23,023
We're going into town.

1492
01:54:23,148 --> 01:54:25,234
Which town?
We have several nearby.

1493
01:54:25,359 --> 01:54:27,736
Philadelphia. To visit family.

1494
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:29,530
Ah, the American cousin,
of course.

1495
01:54:29,655 --> 01:54:32,449
- So the city, then?
- Yes, yes, the city.

1496
01:54:32,575 --> 01:54:36,495
Ah. Us as well.
Well, don't just stand there.

1497
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,330
Let us give you
and your auntie a lift.

1498
01:54:39,415 --> 01:54:40,666
Thank you.

1499
01:54:43,586 --> 01:54:45,879
I have a friend
in New York, a newspaper man.

1500
01:54:46,005 --> 01:54:47,840
He's always on the lookout
for new talent.

1501
01:54:47,965 --> 01:54:49,466
Should I mention you to him?

1502
01:54:49,592 --> 01:54:51,427
It's very kind
of you, Mr Van Buren.

1503
01:54:53,762 --> 01:54:56,015
Would that mean I would
have to work out of New York?

1504
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:57,891
Well, perhaps, in the beginning.

1505
01:54:58,017 --> 01:54:59,268
But you don't have the job yet,

1506
01:54:59,393 --> 01:55:00,853
so let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

1507
01:55:00,978 --> 01:55:02,396
Of course not.

1508
01:55:02,521 --> 01:55:04,023
I did not mean it
to be presumptuous.

1509
01:55:04,148 --> 01:55:05,566
No, no.

1510
01:55:07,192 --> 01:55:08,527
In any event,

1511
01:55:08,652 --> 01:55:10,571
you could always commute there
with me at the start.

1512
01:55:10,696 --> 01:55:12,656
I'm there Monday to Friday.

1513
01:55:13,574 --> 01:55:16,368
Yes, that could be fine.

1514
01:55:16,493 --> 01:55:18,287
I would have to speak
with László, though.

1515
01:55:18,412 --> 01:55:19,913
I can assure you,
when ground breaks,

1516
01:55:20,039 --> 01:55:21,874
he will have his hands full.

1517
01:55:21,999 --> 01:55:26,629
And besides, I enjoy showing
friends around Manhattan.

1518
01:55:26,754 --> 01:55:28,756
You can't have seen much of it
on your way here.

1519
01:55:28,881 --> 01:55:31,175
Penn Station Terminal
was very nice.

1520
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:33,093
It <i>is</i> very nice.

1521
01:55:33,218 --> 01:55:35,095
It's a pity it's so full
of tramps these days

1522
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:37,514
hassling women and children
with their arms outstretched.

1523
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:39,433
They line up and extend
from the walls

1524
01:55:39,558 --> 01:55:41,435
as if integral
to its very foundation

1525
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:43,020
like some haunted wall mural.

1526
01:55:43,145 --> 01:55:45,689
Perhaps that is why
I felt so at home.

1527
01:55:45,814 --> 01:55:48,484
I'm a former bag lady myself,

1528
01:55:48,609 --> 01:55:52,488
who does also enjoy the work
of the Dutch masters.

1529
01:55:53,822 --> 01:55:57,660
<i>Earthly Delights.</i>
You heard it just as I intended.

1530
01:55:57,785 --> 01:55:59,495
Very clever.

1531
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:03,165
But "integral
to its foundation..."

1532
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:04,375
A mural is decorative.

1533
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:07,252
It has nothing to do
with the foundation.

1534
01:56:07,378 --> 01:56:08,754
<i>Touché.</i>

1535
01:56:09,713 --> 01:56:12,091
Where did you get your passion
for architecture?

1536
01:56:12,216 --> 01:56:13,884
Oh, we've done buildings before,

1537
01:56:14,009 --> 01:56:16,178
but I'd hardly
call them artistic.

1538
01:56:16,303 --> 01:56:19,682
I don't know. Perhaps it was
because my cellar was full.

1539
01:56:20,683 --> 01:56:22,184
Pardon?

1540
01:56:22,309 --> 01:56:24,520
I collect books,
butterflies and such,

1541
01:56:24,645 --> 01:56:27,815
but above all else,
Portuguese Madeira.

1542
01:56:27,940 --> 01:56:30,317
I take it every evening
after supper.

1543
01:56:30,442 --> 01:56:32,611
I've done the math,
and if I were to uncork a bottle

1544
01:56:32,736 --> 01:56:34,530
seven days a week
for the next 30 years,

1545
01:56:34,655 --> 01:56:37,199
the maximum
of my life's expectancy,

1546
01:56:37,324 --> 01:56:40,119
I would need no more
than 10,000 bottles, all told.

1547
01:56:40,244 --> 01:56:41,662
So once the cellar was full,

1548
01:56:41,787 --> 01:56:44,540
it was time to set about
in a new direction.

1549
01:56:44,665 --> 01:56:47,418
Out of the cellar
and into the sky.

1550
01:56:47,543 --> 01:56:50,295
If you were to drink a bottle
of Madeira every day,

1551
01:56:50,421 --> 01:56:52,256
I shouldn't think
you'd last 30 years.

1552
01:56:54,341 --> 01:56:56,719
I always keep good company.

1553
01:56:56,844 --> 01:56:58,721
That helps.

1554
01:57:03,434 --> 01:57:06,145
<i>I wanna be honest and</i>
<i>I want you to be honest too,</i>

1555
01:57:06,270 --> 01:57:07,563
<i>then when we get married...</i>

1556
01:57:07,688 --> 01:57:09,815
Whatever you need.
I'm very grateful.

1557
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:11,316
Yep, thank you. Yep.

1558
01:57:12,317 --> 01:57:13,902
I'm gonna
have to call you back.

1559
01:57:14,945 --> 01:57:16,447
How dare you?

1560
01:57:16,572 --> 01:57:17,865
How dare I what?

1561
01:57:17,990 --> 01:57:19,908
You go behind their back!

1562
01:57:20,743 --> 01:57:23,662
You have the meeting
with another goddamn designer!

1563
01:57:24,455 --> 01:57:27,458
Who in the hell is James
T Simpson? Who is he?

1564
01:57:27,583 --> 01:57:29,418
You want to try
to get me sacked!

1565
01:57:29,543 --> 01:57:32,296
I didn't tell him to meet with
anyone. Of course I didn't.

1566
01:57:32,421 --> 01:57:34,965
You think I feel like working
with you hating my guts

1567
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:37,843
for the next
two godforsaken years?

1568
01:57:39,303 --> 01:57:42,514
Look, Jim Simpson
is a smart guy.

1569
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:44,183
He doesn't want to
interfere at all.

1570
01:57:44,308 --> 01:57:46,685
I am not approving
these changes.

1571
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:48,395
Well, I'm afraid
it's not up to you.

1572
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,689
The casts are already finished.
We put in that order

1573
01:57:50,814 --> 01:57:52,024
- over a month ago.
- What?

1574
01:57:52,149 --> 01:57:53,817
This is the first time
you're hearing about it?

1575
01:57:53,942 --> 01:57:54,860
Fuck!

1576
01:57:54,985 --> 01:57:57,362
No one tells me
a goddamn thing here!

1577
01:57:57,488 --> 01:57:59,948
Harrison said he would
talk it over with you.

1578
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:02,951
I'm sorry you found out
this way, I really am.

1579
01:58:06,121 --> 01:58:08,999
There. It is mine again.

1580
01:58:09,124 --> 01:58:11,585
He cuts three metres
from the top,

1581
01:58:11,710 --> 01:58:13,504
I add it to the bottom.

1582
01:58:14,213 --> 01:58:15,464
There you go.

1583
01:58:16,298 --> 01:58:17,716
We can't afford all this.

1584
01:58:17,841 --> 01:58:19,676
I'm already overbudget
this quarter.

1585
01:58:19,802 --> 01:58:22,095
You take what you need
from my fee, Leslie.

1586
01:58:22,221 --> 01:58:25,349
Come on, what's the difference
between 40 and 50 feet, anyway?

1587
01:58:25,474 --> 01:58:27,518
The ceilings
are still plenty high.

1588
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:29,686
Get it approved!

1589
01:58:29,812 --> 01:58:31,980
Well, we have a walk-through
next week

1590
01:58:32,105 --> 01:58:34,107
and Jim is supposed to be there.

1591
01:58:34,233 --> 01:58:36,109
Just hear him out!

1592
01:58:36,235 --> 01:58:39,363
You can state your case
to Harrison and Harry Lee.

1593
01:58:39,488 --> 01:58:41,114
I won't open my mouth,
I swear it.

1594
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:43,492
Quit talking
and get it approved, Leslie!

1595
01:58:43,617 --> 01:58:45,244
For the cantilevered floors,

1596
01:58:45,369 --> 01:58:47,913
we plan to use upside-down
T-shaped beams

1597
01:58:48,038 --> 01:58:51,208
integrated into concrete slabs
down here.

1598
01:58:51,333 --> 01:58:55,003
This will serve both as the
ceiling for the space above

1599
01:58:55,128 --> 01:58:57,714
and provide resistance
against compression.

1600
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:00,342
Well, which corridor
are we in now?

1601
01:59:00,467 --> 01:59:02,511
We're below ground here.

1602
01:59:02,636 --> 01:59:05,639
It's a sort of passageway
between the main unit

1603
01:59:05,764 --> 01:59:07,808
and the three mid-sized
modular units

1604
01:59:07,933 --> 01:59:09,434
to the south and southeast.

1605
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:12,104
I'm sorry, but I don't see how
any of this acknowledges

1606
01:59:12,229 --> 01:59:13,564
my proposed cuts.

1607
01:59:13,689 --> 01:59:15,691
I took ten feet off the height
of these damn things

1608
01:59:15,816 --> 01:59:17,568
and now we are 30 feet
underground.

1609
01:59:17,693 --> 01:59:19,695
You have added a quarter-mile
or so of tunnel!

1610
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:23,490
We excavate the entire
diameter of the tunnel system

1611
01:59:23,615 --> 01:59:25,409
- using a full-face method.
- A what?

1612
01:59:25,534 --> 01:59:28,787
So that there is something
inside

1613
01:59:28,912 --> 01:59:32,040
for the people to discover.

1614
01:59:32,165 --> 01:59:35,878
And so that it is one building,
not four!

1615
01:59:37,254 --> 01:59:39,089
For its harmony.

1616
01:59:40,507 --> 01:59:42,759
You said it yourself,
Mr Van Buren,

1617
01:59:42,885 --> 01:59:45,012
you expected it
to be one building.

1618
01:59:45,137 --> 01:59:46,680
Well, now it is.

1619
01:59:46,805 --> 01:59:48,473
I'm sorry,
but we are not going back inside

1620
01:59:48,599 --> 01:59:50,434
until you look us all straight
in the eye

1621
01:59:50,559 --> 01:59:52,895
and you tell us where
you are willing to compromise.

1622
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:57,774
Jim, please, tell us again
what it is that you have built.

1623
01:59:59,109 --> 02:00:01,486
- Tell us.
- I'll tell you what I've built.

1624
02:00:01,612 --> 02:00:04,531
I've built a shopping centre
in New Hope,

1625
02:00:04,656 --> 02:00:06,283
a hotel in Stamford,
Connecticut...

1626
02:00:06,408 --> 02:00:08,952
Now, Jim, let me remind everyone

1627
02:00:09,077 --> 02:00:11,580
that László has offered to
personally offset these costs.

1628
02:00:11,705 --> 02:00:14,082
I'm sorry, but you have asked me
to come here

1629
02:00:14,207 --> 02:00:16,168
to tell you what it is
that we do not need.

1630
02:00:16,293 --> 02:00:18,795
Plain and simple, the one thing
we do not need is this guy.

1631
02:00:18,921 --> 02:00:20,130
You two. Jim.

1632
02:00:20,255 --> 02:00:22,132
I'm sorry, but this whole thing
is just bizarre.

1633
02:00:22,257 --> 02:00:24,051
- You must all see...
- Now, look.

1634
02:00:24,176 --> 02:00:26,678
I really think you two
might see eye to eye

1635
02:00:26,803 --> 02:00:29,389
if you just spent a little more
time getting to know each other.

1636
02:00:29,514 --> 02:00:32,684
Jim! Listen to me.

1637
02:00:32,809 --> 02:00:35,854
Come. Listen to me.

1638
02:00:39,191 --> 02:00:41,193
Come. Come here.

1639
02:00:41,318 --> 02:00:42,778
I'm listening.

1640
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:49,618
Everything that is...

1641
02:00:50,494 --> 02:00:51,828
ugly...

1642
02:00:53,789 --> 02:00:55,123
cruel...

1643
02:00:56,124 --> 02:00:57,668
stupid...

1644
02:00:58,710 --> 02:01:01,713
but most importantly, ugly...

1645
02:01:02,631 --> 02:01:06,843
everything... is your fault.

1646
02:01:14,643 --> 02:01:17,854
- Jim! That's enough!
- You want to push me?

1647
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:19,940
I think it's time you went home.

1648
02:01:20,065 --> 02:01:22,234
Thank you for your insight.

1649
02:01:24,486 --> 02:01:25,737
I'm sorry.

1650
02:01:27,656 --> 02:01:28,991
He hit me.

1651
02:01:31,994 --> 02:01:33,370
I trust you.

1652
02:01:34,746 --> 02:01:37,249
I trust you, all right?

1653
02:01:42,796 --> 02:01:45,215
Ah...

1654
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:48,510
It went well,
other than that, I think.

1655
02:01:48,635 --> 02:01:49,594
- Very well.
- Sorry.

1656
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:51,304
- Very well indeed.
- Sorry, I...

1657
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:53,390
- He's an idiot, though.
- Come on.

1658
02:02:13,243 --> 02:02:15,620
- I go home.
- Yeah.

1659
02:02:16,621 --> 02:02:20,042
Harrison,
you sure about this guy?

1660
02:02:20,834 --> 02:02:23,003
Look, I know
Jim lost his temper,

1661
02:02:23,128 --> 02:02:25,881
but he had a few points
back there, didn't he?

1662
02:02:26,006 --> 02:02:28,550
Look, my office
is fielding complaints

1663
02:02:28,675 --> 02:02:31,636
about plans for this place
on a daily basis, more or less.

1664
02:02:32,387 --> 02:02:35,807
Jim's a Protestant.
Gives folks peace of mind.

1665
02:02:36,725 --> 02:02:38,977
People are worried
it's gonna ruin the hillside.

1666
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:41,438
We'll do something. A little
event for the community.

1667
02:02:41,563 --> 02:02:42,522
Get them on side.

1668
02:02:42,647 --> 02:02:44,232
And don't worry,
Jim will stay on.

1669
02:02:44,357 --> 02:02:47,319
Yeah, does Jim know that?
I think he thinks he's fired.

1670
02:02:47,444 --> 02:02:49,780
I'll have Leslie telephone him
tomorrow.

1671
02:02:49,905 --> 02:02:52,365
And he can advise from afar.

1672
02:02:52,491 --> 02:02:54,785
Better for morale that way.

1673
02:02:56,870 --> 02:02:58,497
Mayor Kinney!

1674
02:03:00,957 --> 02:03:03,502
Thank you, everyone,
for being here today.

1675
02:03:09,508 --> 02:03:12,969
Girls, come in for this picture.
Here.

1676
02:03:19,351 --> 02:03:22,938
I'm proud of you.
Make love to me tonight.

1677
02:03:26,483 --> 02:03:29,194
- All right.
- Right. Everybody ready?

1678
02:03:30,445 --> 02:03:33,740
Yes, yes. Feeling lucky.

1679
02:03:33,865 --> 02:03:36,868
On the count of three.

1680
02:03:36,993 --> 02:03:39,579
Three, two, one!

1681
02:03:46,837 --> 02:03:50,215
That's a motor grader.
We used to do it with horses.

1682
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:52,342
Makes a flat surface to pour on.

1683
02:03:52,467 --> 02:03:56,471
Take a lot of horses to do
what that thing can do, William.

1684
02:03:58,223 --> 02:04:00,642
If you want, in the morning,

1685
02:04:00,767 --> 02:04:03,145
we can take you down there
if you're curious.

1686
02:04:04,521 --> 02:04:07,232
What do you say we get you
in one of them machines?

1687
02:04:07,357 --> 02:04:08,984
Sure.

1688
02:04:09,109 --> 02:04:10,777
Big day, Mr Tóth.

1689
02:04:13,196 --> 02:04:15,991
Yes. Yes, it is.

1690
02:04:18,118 --> 02:04:19,703
Excuse us, gentlemen.

1691
02:04:23,957 --> 02:04:26,543
Leslie mentioned during
our meeting with Jim last week

1692
02:04:26,668 --> 02:04:29,963
that you're planning on putting
your fee back into the project.

1693
02:04:31,089 --> 02:04:33,425
Seems a bit irresponsible,
doesn't it,

1694
02:04:33,550 --> 02:04:35,302
given your situation?

1695
02:04:36,386 --> 02:04:39,055
Will it even last you
to the end of your commitment?

1696
02:04:44,186 --> 02:04:46,188
I will figure something out.

1697
02:04:48,190 --> 02:04:50,442
Have you discussed it
with your wife?

1698
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:55,155
She will be supportive.

1699
02:04:57,157 --> 02:05:00,493
Suit yourself. I wouldn't do it.

1700
02:05:01,578 --> 02:05:04,539
I know Leslie
certainly wouldn't do it.

1701
02:05:05,916 --> 02:05:07,083
I didn't want you to think

1702
02:05:07,209 --> 02:05:09,294
you'd be setting
any sort of precedent.

1703
02:05:10,462 --> 02:05:14,049
I expect nothing
from either of you.

1704
02:05:21,973 --> 02:05:23,767
How does that work?

1705
02:05:26,853 --> 02:05:31,107
The company paying themselves
a fee to finance?

1706
02:05:33,235 --> 02:05:34,986
Do you not think
I deserve to be paid

1707
02:05:35,111 --> 02:05:38,573
for the time and energy
I devote to the project?

1708
02:05:43,578 --> 02:05:45,455
Might I make a suggestion?

1709
02:05:47,832 --> 02:05:49,125
You might.

1710
02:05:51,586 --> 02:05:54,089
Your niece has made
several of our guests

1711
02:05:54,214 --> 02:05:56,049
very uncomfortable.

1712
02:05:57,008 --> 02:05:59,135
Perhaps you should
have a talk with her.

1713
02:06:01,096 --> 02:06:02,889
About what?

1714
02:06:04,557 --> 02:06:07,143
Don't get me wrong, she's...

1715
02:06:07,269 --> 02:06:10,063
she's very lovely to look at,
I know.

1716
02:06:10,897 --> 02:06:13,233
As much as we all dream
of having a little birdy

1717
02:06:13,358 --> 02:06:15,986
that keeps her trap shut,

1718
02:06:16,111 --> 02:06:18,822
comes off
like a rude affectation.

1719
02:06:20,031 --> 02:06:24,369
And I've tried to connect.
Make conversation.

1720
02:06:24,494 --> 02:06:26,329
It goes nowhere.

1721
02:06:30,292 --> 02:06:33,295
Oh, it runs in the family.

1722
02:06:37,173 --> 02:06:39,301
I would like us to be friends.

1723
02:06:40,343 --> 02:06:41,344
Huh!

1724
02:06:45,348 --> 02:06:46,474
Great.

1725
02:06:48,518 --> 02:06:51,396
This is not friendly, Harry.

1726
02:06:52,605 --> 02:06:55,734
I didn't say I'd like
to slip my prick into her.

1727
02:07:04,326 --> 02:07:05,493
Forget it.

1728
02:07:08,079 --> 02:07:09,831
I had too much to drink.

1729
02:07:10,915 --> 02:07:12,125
I need a nap.

1730
02:07:16,504 --> 02:07:18,048
László?

1731
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:23,678
We tolerate you.

1732
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:41,571
Rub-a-dub-dub,
three maids in a tub.

1733
02:07:41,696 --> 02:07:44,115
Who do you think were there?

1734
02:07:44,240 --> 02:07:47,494
Butcher, the baker,
the candlestick maker.

1735
02:08:01,633 --> 02:08:05,053
It's invigorating, isn't it?

1736
02:08:15,688 --> 02:08:17,649
Do you fancy a stroll?

1737
02:08:17,774 --> 02:08:18,858
I swear it.

1738
02:08:18,983 --> 02:08:21,319
They looked exactly
like that popular painting.

1739
02:08:21,444 --> 02:08:22,821
You know the one. Ooh!

1740
02:08:22,946 --> 02:08:25,115
Oh, stop it!

1741
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:27,367
Daddy kept apologising
to our hostess.

1742
02:08:27,492 --> 02:08:29,953
For context...
for context, her husband

1743
02:08:30,078 --> 02:08:31,496
was one of Van Buren
Manufacturer's

1744
02:08:31,621 --> 02:08:33,373
most important private clients.

1745
02:08:33,498 --> 02:08:35,250
Daddy tried
to explain everything

1746
02:08:35,375 --> 02:08:36,626
that had made us late
that evening,

1747
02:08:36,751 --> 02:08:38,044
as she prepared

1748
02:08:38,169 --> 02:08:41,214
what appeared to be
a delightful-looking trifle.

1749
02:08:41,339 --> 02:08:43,049
- Was it awful?
- Yes.

1750
02:08:43,174 --> 02:08:46,469
I kid you not,
cow tallow and fruit pie.

1751
02:08:46,594 --> 02:08:50,098
No!

1752
02:08:50,223 --> 02:08:51,808
And Daddy
has such a sweet tooth.

1753
02:08:51,933 --> 02:08:53,977
I didn't know how to warn him
in front of everyone.

1754
02:08:54,102 --> 02:08:56,187
- I was starving.
- He took a bite this big.

1755
02:08:56,312 --> 02:08:57,897
I was starving!

1756
02:08:58,022 --> 02:09:01,317
He began gagging
like a housecat.

1757
02:09:04,237 --> 02:09:07,031
And all he could say
to explain was...

1758
02:09:07,157 --> 02:09:10,410
"Dear, I'm allergic."

1759
02:09:10,535 --> 02:09:12,620
"I'm allergic."

1760
02:09:12,745 --> 02:09:15,457
To which our concerned hostess
replied,

1761
02:09:15,582 --> 02:09:18,209
"Oh, goodness,
allergic to what?"

1762
02:09:18,334 --> 02:09:21,337
And he said, "To that."

1763
02:09:21,463 --> 02:09:23,715
"I am allergic
to whatever that is."

1764
02:09:33,683 --> 02:09:35,018
Oh, Daddy.

1765
02:09:41,691 --> 02:09:42,984
Let's go.

1766
02:09:44,986 --> 02:09:46,279
Bring the chair, please.

1767
02:09:54,412 --> 02:09:55,747
Zsófia.

1768
02:10:01,419 --> 02:10:02,587
You all right?

1769
02:10:04,923 --> 02:10:07,467
It has been a lovely day.

1770
02:10:07,592 --> 02:10:08,885
It certainly has been.

1771
02:10:10,011 --> 02:10:11,387
Pity the wind's
picked up a little.

1772
02:10:11,513 --> 02:10:14,974
Erszi. It's time for us to go.

1773
02:10:15,099 --> 02:10:16,809
You won't join us for dinner
at the house?

1774
02:10:16,935 --> 02:10:19,812
Uh, we start early tomorrow.

1775
02:10:19,938 --> 02:10:21,689
Thank you for the event.

1776
02:10:21,814 --> 02:10:24,359
- Does he ever take a break?
- Never!

1777
02:10:24,484 --> 02:10:26,194
Goodbye, Mr Van Buren.

1778
02:10:26,319 --> 02:10:27,779
All right, stay warm.

1779
02:10:29,322 --> 02:10:30,907
What's the rush?

1780
02:10:31,032 --> 02:10:32,867
We will talk at the house.

1781
02:10:38,206 --> 02:10:40,083
László, can you slow down?

1782
02:10:42,919 --> 02:10:44,462
Can you slow down?

1783
02:10:46,130 --> 02:10:49,342
I am forfeiting
the remainder of my fee

1784
02:10:49,467 --> 02:10:52,262
due to some expenses unforeseen.

1785
02:10:53,221 --> 02:10:55,807
Oh, so that's what the son
kept alluding to.

1786
02:10:56,558 --> 02:10:58,601
Yes. He's a snake.

1787
02:11:01,521 --> 02:11:03,773
Don't go near him, Zsófia.

1788
02:11:04,107 --> 02:11:06,568
All right,
so what will that mean for us?

1789
02:11:07,944 --> 02:11:11,239
- I will figure something out.
- We will figure something out.

1790
02:11:12,323 --> 02:11:14,450
I suppose we can make do
on my salary.

1791
02:11:15,743 --> 02:11:17,120
Your salary?

1792
02:11:17,245 --> 02:11:19,372
Mr Van Buren's helped me
with a job interview

1793
02:11:19,497 --> 02:11:21,332
in New York City.

1794
02:11:21,457 --> 02:11:24,752
I'm sure once they meet me,
they won't be able to resist me.

1795
02:11:27,171 --> 02:11:29,299
Thank you
for the supper, Mrs Tóth.

1796
02:11:29,424 --> 02:11:31,551
I thought we might
have our own little party

1797
02:11:31,676 --> 02:11:33,469
to celebrate
all of your hard work.

1798
02:11:33,595 --> 02:11:36,806
You've come so far,
the both of you.

1799
02:11:36,931 --> 02:11:38,975
Oh, it's not mine, really.

1800
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:40,935
That's not what László tells me.

1801
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:44,022
He says he couldn't have done it
without you.

1802
02:11:46,649 --> 02:11:49,360
So do you have a missus at home,
Gordon?

1803
02:11:50,486 --> 02:11:53,489
Augusta passed away in '43.

1804
02:11:53,615 --> 02:11:57,702
She was sick and died of a damn
tooth infection, of all things.

1805
02:11:57,827 --> 02:11:59,954
Very sorry to hear that.

1806
02:12:01,164 --> 02:12:03,583
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss.

1807
02:12:04,584 --> 02:12:08,880
He's all right. He was too young
then to remember much.

1808
02:12:09,005 --> 02:12:11,424
And I was gone two years
in Arizona

1809
02:12:11,549 --> 02:12:14,260
before they shipped us all off
to Naples, Italy.

1810
02:12:14,385 --> 02:12:16,846
92nd Infantry Division.

1811
02:12:16,971 --> 02:12:20,516
They wouldn't let me back home
all that time, not once.

1812
02:12:20,642 --> 02:12:24,354
Augusta's sister looked
after him until I got back.

1813
02:12:24,479 --> 02:12:27,607
Kept me alive, though,
knowing he was waiting for me.

1814
02:12:28,691 --> 02:12:31,778
Kept me good and alive,
thank goodness.

1815
02:12:31,903 --> 02:12:34,614
Zsófia's mother passed.

1816
02:12:37,617 --> 02:12:41,454
Losing a mother,
it's an unfathomable loss.

1817
02:12:42,538 --> 02:12:44,248
To lose one's birth mother

1818
02:12:44,374 --> 02:12:47,543
is to lose the very foundation
on which we stand.

1819
02:12:49,545 --> 02:12:54,050
The mind may not know its loss,
but the heart does.

1820
02:12:58,513 --> 02:12:59,972
I remember her.

1821
02:13:00,598 --> 02:13:02,850
That's because I've told you
so much about her.

1822
02:13:02,975 --> 02:13:04,602
You were too small.

1823
02:13:04,727 --> 02:13:07,355
No, I remember Augusta.

1824
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:09,899
I just wanted
to make it easier on you.

1825
02:13:33,423 --> 02:13:35,091
What are you doing?

1826
02:13:39,637 --> 02:13:41,514
I'm just looking at you.

1827
02:13:43,891 --> 02:13:45,393
What do you think?

1828
02:13:46,394 --> 02:13:50,064
It's unusual, even for you.

1829
02:13:51,983 --> 02:13:53,735
- Think so?
- Hmm.

1830
02:13:54,569 --> 02:13:57,447
Many of the rooms
are quite small,

1831
02:13:57,572 --> 02:14:00,032
yet the ceilings are high.

1832
02:14:00,158 --> 02:14:01,451
Yes.

1833
02:14:02,493 --> 02:14:05,371
Inside, you must look upwards.

1834
02:14:05,496 --> 02:14:07,957
So which part of it
are we paying for?

1835
02:14:10,668 --> 02:14:12,628
The height of the ceiling.

1836
02:14:13,838 --> 02:14:15,298
The glass above.

1837
02:14:20,303 --> 02:14:21,637
I like it.

1838
02:14:22,555 --> 02:14:24,432
I'm so happy you approve.

1839
02:15:01,177 --> 02:15:03,221
The service is in here?

1840
02:15:03,346 --> 02:15:04,680
For the overflow.

1841
02:15:04,806 --> 02:15:06,682
Because of the holiday?

1842
02:15:06,808 --> 02:15:08,434
The community's growing.

1843
02:17:22,944 --> 02:17:26,238
What?

1844
02:17:26,364 --> 02:17:29,200
Erzsébet? Erzsébet?
What is happening?

1845
02:17:29,325 --> 02:17:31,494
It's too much.

1846
02:17:31,619 --> 02:17:35,164
- What is too much?
- The pain. It's too much.

1847
02:17:35,289 --> 02:17:38,626
I need Zsófia.
She has my medication.

1848
02:17:38,751 --> 02:17:41,671
Zsófia!

1849
02:17:42,546 --> 02:17:44,548
Zsófia!

1850
02:17:52,515 --> 02:17:53,808
Zsófia.

1851
02:17:54,558 --> 02:17:55,768
Oh, my God!

1852
02:17:58,396 --> 02:18:01,857
Get it. Go to her. Go to her.

1853
02:18:07,363 --> 02:18:10,783
Give it to her.

1854
02:18:10,908 --> 02:18:12,076
Take it.

1855
02:18:12,952 --> 02:18:15,329
I have everyone
here with me now, yes.

1856
02:18:16,163 --> 02:18:18,916
I see. Well, if there's
anything more we can do.

1857
02:18:19,041 --> 02:18:20,835
We're terribly sorry
for the news.

1858
02:18:22,086 --> 02:18:23,546
On tenterhooks at this end,

1859
02:18:23,671 --> 02:18:26,298
so give me a ring here
when you have something.

1860
02:18:27,591 --> 02:18:29,301
A big section came undone.

1861
02:18:29,427 --> 02:18:31,053
He didn't know which one
for certain.

1862
02:18:31,178 --> 02:18:32,888
And it took seven freight cars
along with it.

1863
02:18:33,014 --> 02:18:35,891
Goddamn it, Leslie! How the hell
do you find these people?

1864
02:18:36,017 --> 02:18:37,685
Transpo company is our own, Dad.

1865
02:18:37,810 --> 02:18:39,520
What?

1866
02:18:39,645 --> 02:18:41,731
We sent our own guys
to Charleston.

1867
02:18:41,856 --> 02:18:43,441
The rail cars were ours too.

1868
02:18:43,566 --> 02:18:45,401
It was cheaper,
given all the back and forth.

1869
02:18:45,526 --> 02:18:47,403
It's well over
a hundred shipments, Harrison.

1870
02:18:47,528 --> 02:18:49,488
You don't utter another word
to that rail company

1871
02:18:49,613 --> 02:18:50,906
till Michael can advise.

1872
02:18:51,032 --> 02:18:53,242
I'm hoping to have
some answers for you soon, sir.

1873
02:18:54,660 --> 02:18:58,122
Can we see what can be salvaged?
How far is it?

1874
02:18:58,247 --> 02:19:00,791
The accident put two brakemen
in the hospital.

1875
02:19:00,916 --> 02:19:02,293
It's a real mess out there.

1876
02:19:02,418 --> 02:19:05,463
Send flowers to them, to
the families for Christ's sake.

1877
02:19:05,588 --> 02:19:08,049
Oh, wait, don't!
That looks guilty.

1878
02:19:08,174 --> 02:19:09,675
I'll call Michael.

1879
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:13,054
What do you want me to do
in the meantime?

1880
02:19:13,179 --> 02:19:15,056
- With what?
- Well, our crew.

1881
02:19:16,599 --> 02:19:17,975
Let them go.

1882
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:20,186
- You can't, sir, you cannot...
- Yes, I can!

1883
02:19:20,311 --> 02:19:23,064
Yes. Yes, I can!

1884
02:19:31,614 --> 02:19:33,616
People are gonna
write about this.

1885
02:19:34,283 --> 02:19:35,409
I'm staring down the barrel

1886
02:19:35,534 --> 02:19:37,995
of the next two goddamn years
of my life.

1887
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:41,582
What if one of them dies?
What if they both die?

1888
02:19:42,666 --> 02:19:44,794
Who pays for it?
Are you gonna pay for it?

1889
02:19:44,919 --> 02:19:46,253
Are you gonna pay for it?

1890
02:19:47,004 --> 02:19:49,340
László,
in the interest of transparency,

1891
02:19:49,465 --> 02:19:52,218
before I came to retrieve you,
I'd already advised Mr Van Buren

1892
02:19:52,343 --> 02:19:54,178
- to cut his losses...
- Shut up, Leslie!

1893
02:19:55,763 --> 02:19:58,182
Sir. Sir, please.

1894
02:19:58,307 --> 02:20:00,810
Don't beg! It's unbecoming!

1895
02:20:07,733 --> 02:20:08,943
You're welcome to stay here

1896
02:20:09,068 --> 02:20:10,903
until you find your footing
elsewhere.

1897
02:20:12,196 --> 02:20:13,864
I have a mess to clean up.

1898
02:20:26,544 --> 02:20:27,795
<i>I'm sorry, Gordon.</i>

1899
02:20:28,838 --> 02:20:30,256
Don't apologise to me.

1900
02:20:30,381 --> 02:20:33,342
I will give you some money
while you look for something.

1901
02:20:33,467 --> 02:20:34,677
I'll be fine.

1902
02:20:35,386 --> 02:20:40,182
You have a kid. I will give you
something and you will take it.

1903
02:20:43,185 --> 02:20:44,186
Listen...

1904
02:20:46,105 --> 02:20:47,481
you got any, uh...

1905
02:20:48,816 --> 02:20:50,693
any hop on you?

1906
02:20:50,818 --> 02:20:53,696
None at all. I'm off it.

1907
02:20:56,782 --> 02:20:58,117
Good.

1908
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:00,828
Good. That's...

1909
02:21:02,329 --> 02:21:03,330
That's good to hear.

1910
02:21:08,752 --> 02:21:09,879
Fuck.

1911
02:21:10,921 --> 02:21:13,048
{\an8}

1912
02:21:13,174 --> 02:21:14,049
Fuck!

1913
02:21:17,428 --> 02:21:19,430
Damn it all to hell!

1914
02:21:23,225 --> 02:21:24,935
Stop it!

1915
02:21:25,060 --> 02:21:27,021
Stop it!
You're acting like a child.

1916
02:21:27,146 --> 02:21:27,938
It's over!

1917
02:21:28,063 --> 02:21:29,815
You're making me
a mess to clean up.

1918
02:21:29,940 --> 02:21:30,816
It's over!

1919
02:21:32,860 --> 02:21:34,987
You have to march over there
right now

1920
02:21:35,112 --> 02:21:36,822
and get him excited again.

1921
02:21:37,781 --> 02:21:39,366
Keep him engaged.

1922
02:21:40,034 --> 02:21:41,535
You know
how these rich fellows are.

1923
02:21:41,660 --> 02:21:44,580
For him, it's like... it's like
refurbishing a kitchen.

1924
02:21:45,581 --> 02:21:48,125
Two people are in the hospital.

1925
02:21:48,250 --> 02:21:50,794
He does not want to proceed.

1926
02:21:50,920 --> 02:21:52,546
That's not your fault!

1927
02:21:58,135 --> 02:21:59,678
It's over.

1928
02:22:01,055 --> 02:22:02,598
Over.

1929
02:22:04,683 --> 02:22:05,726
Over.

1930
02:22:07,394 --> 02:22:08,771
Finished!

1931
02:22:11,607 --> 02:22:13,150
Fuck!

1932
02:22:22,660 --> 02:22:24,078
<i>Good evening, New York,</i>

1934

02:22:32,503 --> 02:22:34,255

1939
02:23:03,659 --> 02:23:07,913
All right.
Yes. I'll make a note of it.

1940
02:23:09,915 --> 02:23:11,166
Morning.

1941
02:23:11,292 --> 02:23:14,044
I'm looking for Rudolph Heywood
and Associates.

1942
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:17,756
Pardon me, sir, but who is it
you're looking for?

1943
02:23:17,881 --> 02:23:20,384
László Tóth. He draws there.

1944
02:23:20,509 --> 02:23:22,219
Could I ask you to spell that?

1945
02:23:22,344 --> 02:23:27,057
- Yeah, it's, uh, L-A-S-L-O...
- Oh. Yes. I see him.

1946
02:23:27,683 --> 02:23:29,643
The draughtsmen
are right upstairs.

1947
02:23:29,768 --> 02:23:32,313
All righty. Thank you, ma'am.

1948
02:23:52,458 --> 02:23:54,460
<i>The Macy's</i>
<i>Thanksgiving Day Parade</i>

1949

02:23:56,253 --> 02:24:01,050

1951
02:24:01,175 --> 02:24:03,469

1952
02:24:19,943 --> 02:24:21,070
László?

1953
02:24:28,410 --> 02:24:29,536
László?

1954
02:24:38,420 --> 02:24:39,797
Michael.

1955
02:24:42,341 --> 02:24:43,884
We have some news.

1956
02:24:45,386 --> 02:24:46,762
As do I.

1957
02:24:47,513 --> 02:24:50,974
How exciting.
What is it, László?

1958
02:24:51,975 --> 02:24:54,812
Please. Go ahead, Zsófia.

1959
02:24:56,647 --> 02:24:58,357
We are making Aliyah.

1960
02:24:59,483 --> 02:25:03,028
- What?
- We are going to Jerusalem.

1961
02:25:03,153 --> 02:25:04,488
I heard you.

1962
02:25:04,613 --> 02:25:06,448
Binyamin has family there.

1963
02:25:06,573 --> 02:25:10,119
My older brothers relocated
with their families in 1950.

1964
02:25:10,244 --> 02:25:11,912
They became citizens.

1965
02:25:13,747 --> 02:25:16,125
Life is difficult there.

1966
02:25:16,875 --> 02:25:18,460
Have you thought this through?

1967
02:25:18,585 --> 02:25:20,421
It is our obligation.

1968
02:25:21,922 --> 02:25:23,340
To whom?

1969
02:25:23,465 --> 02:25:25,551
Our repatriation
is our liberation.

1970
02:25:25,676 --> 02:25:27,219
Oh, please...

1971
02:25:28,804 --> 02:25:30,556
Where will you live?

1972
02:25:31,557 --> 02:25:32,724
Hmm?

1973
02:25:32,850 --> 02:25:34,393
Where will you work?

1974
02:25:34,518 --> 02:25:38,147
We can stay with my brother's
family when we first arrive.

1975
02:25:38,272 --> 02:25:41,191
I was planning to help
with the baby.

1976
02:25:41,316 --> 02:25:43,569
My brother's wife can help,
also.

1977
02:25:44,695 --> 02:25:45,904
I know.

1978
02:25:47,156 --> 02:25:51,410
I am Jewish. My child is Jewish.
We must go home now.

1979
02:25:51,535 --> 02:25:53,996
Does it somehow make us
less Jewish that we are here?

1980
02:25:54,121 --> 02:25:55,497
Are we not Jewish?

1981
02:25:58,375 --> 02:25:59,918
I see.

1982
02:26:01,795 --> 02:26:05,174
Perhaps Binyamin did not
recognise me to begin with.

1983
02:26:05,299 --> 02:26:06,675
He does.

1984
02:26:15,350 --> 02:26:16,810
I'm sorry.

1985
02:26:17,978 --> 02:26:19,313
No, I'm sorry.

1986
02:26:19,897 --> 02:26:21,190
I'm sorry.

1987
02:26:25,068 --> 02:26:26,862
It's wonderful news.

1988
02:26:28,322 --> 02:26:29,740
Mm-hm.

1989
02:26:29,865 --> 02:26:33,076
We reacted badly
out of self-interest.

1990
02:26:35,204 --> 02:26:36,663
It is simply that...

1991
02:26:38,707 --> 02:26:40,667
we are going to miss you.

1992
02:26:42,044 --> 02:26:44,171
Well, we would like you to come.

1993
02:26:44,922 --> 02:26:47,591
Dear, we have jobs here.

1994
02:26:47,716 --> 02:26:49,259
You could have a better job
in Israel.

1995
02:26:49,384 --> 02:26:50,385
I like my job.

1996
02:26:50,511 --> 02:26:52,221
A women's column.
It's beneath you.

1997
02:26:52,346 --> 02:26:54,556
I write for a paper
and I'm paid for it.

1998
02:26:55,974 --> 02:26:58,852
How many women my age
could make the same claim?

1999
02:27:04,399 --> 02:27:06,318
What's your news, László?

2000
02:27:09,571 --> 02:27:12,449
Harrison asked me back.

2001
02:27:27,297 --> 02:27:30,175
Michael
came by the office today.

2002
02:27:32,010 --> 02:27:35,013
Insurance monies came through.

2003
02:27:36,181 --> 02:27:38,141
They plan to forego the library

2004
02:27:38,267 --> 02:27:41,395
to compensate
for legal expenses, but...

2005
02:27:43,564 --> 02:27:45,899
they want to complete
the project.

2006
02:27:46,024 --> 02:27:48,110
I don't like that man.

2007
02:27:48,235 --> 02:27:49,653
You scarcely knew him.

2008
02:27:49,778 --> 02:27:52,489
He dropped you
as quickly as he took you on.

2009
02:27:52,614 --> 02:27:56,285
He's in Roma on business.

2010
02:27:56,410 --> 02:27:57,703
He would like me to join him

2011
02:27:57,828 --> 02:28:02,124
to select the marble
for the altarpiece in Carrara.

2012
02:28:02,249 --> 02:28:05,794
I told you, for him,
it's like doing a kitchen.

2013
02:28:09,172 --> 02:28:10,132
Darling?

2014
02:28:10,257 --> 02:28:11,633
Everyone is leaving me.

2015
02:28:11,758 --> 02:28:13,427
- No, it isn't true.
- Isn't it?

2016
02:28:13,552 --> 02:28:15,929
- No.
- No, it isn't.

2017
02:28:16,054 --> 02:28:19,641
Uncle László is leaving you
only for a short time.

2018
02:28:19,766 --> 02:28:21,101
For some days.

2019
02:28:21,226 --> 02:28:24,521
And I will visit and so will
you. We will find a way.

2020
02:28:24,646 --> 02:28:25,981
I can make arrangements

2021
02:28:26,106 --> 02:28:28,442
to have you dropped
and picked up at the newspaper.

2022
02:28:28,567 --> 02:28:31,612
No. It's not just this trip.

2023
02:28:33,238 --> 02:28:35,699
You'll be in Doylestown again
now.

2024
02:28:39,161 --> 02:28:41,121
I'll be fine on my own.

2025
02:28:49,838 --> 02:28:51,548
I will make arrangements.

2026
02:28:52,758 --> 02:28:55,844
Promise you won't let it
drive you mad.

2027
02:29:01,391 --> 02:29:02,893
I promise.

2028
02:29:19,660 --> 02:29:22,454
It's time to go!
You'll be late!

2029
02:29:22,579 --> 02:29:25,248
Yes, yes. Yes, one minute.

2030
02:30:32,733 --> 02:30:35,318
I must say, Mr Tóth,
you look a mess.

2031
02:30:37,070 --> 02:30:40,365
I would expect your Elizabeth
to be taking better care of you.

2032
02:30:42,868 --> 02:30:45,537
The years have been difficult.

2033
02:30:45,662 --> 02:30:47,247
For us all.

2034
02:30:48,123 --> 02:30:49,249
For us all.

2035
02:30:50,083 --> 02:30:51,084
Hm.

2036
02:30:57,591 --> 02:30:59,009
Where the hell is he?

2037
02:31:01,887 --> 02:31:04,514
I'm sure he'll be...
be along any minute.

2038
02:31:06,725 --> 02:31:08,602
He lives in the mountains.

2039
02:31:09,603 --> 02:31:10,771
It takes time.

2040
02:31:15,108 --> 02:31:17,694
This is why I never do business
with Italians.

2041
02:31:18,487 --> 02:31:20,280
They're the spics of Europe.

2042
02:31:21,698 --> 02:31:22,949
Hello, László, my friend!

2043
02:31:23,450 --> 02:31:25,452
He's right here now.

2044
02:31:25,577 --> 02:31:27,829
Hello, Orazio.

2045
02:31:28,205 --> 02:31:30,916
- Finally, darling.
<i>- Che bello.</i>

2046
02:31:35,837 --> 02:31:38,298
- Mr Van Buren.
- Orazio.

2047
02:31:38,423 --> 02:31:40,634
I will take a coffee
and we can go.

2048
02:31:43,637 --> 02:31:44,721
Hey...

2049
02:31:46,473 --> 02:31:47,974
What happened to his hand?

2050
02:31:50,644 --> 02:31:52,020
Dangerous work.

2051
02:31:57,734 --> 02:32:00,237
You are tough, Mr László,
you know?

2052
02:32:00,654 --> 02:32:02,906
{\an8}I've worn the wrong
shoes for this little trek.

2053
02:32:03,031 --> 02:32:04,699
{\an8}Do you mind if I take your arm?

2054
02:32:05,617 --> 02:32:08,078
Step where I step,
you will be all right.

2055
02:32:09,913 --> 02:32:13,708
There aren't many people I
see anymore from before the war.

2056
02:32:13,834 --> 02:32:16,044
I'm not surprised to see you, though.

2057
02:32:17,587 --> 02:32:21,842
Some people, you just knew
somehow they would be all right.

2058
02:32:22,425 --> 02:32:24,052
Because you are stubborn.

2059
02:32:25,178 --> 02:32:26,471
And so am I.

2060
02:32:27,931 --> 02:32:29,641
I will never leave this place.

2061
02:32:29,766 --> 02:32:31,393
<i>Because you are stubborn.</i>

2062
02:32:31,518 --> 02:32:33,395
<i>And so am I.</i>

2063
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:35,605
<i>I will never leave this place.</i>

2064
02:32:35,730 --> 02:32:40,694
I have left only once in 20 years
to go to Giulino, Azzano,

2065
02:32:40,819 --> 02:32:45,156
to beat the corpse of Mussolini
with my own hands.

2066
02:32:46,116 --> 02:32:51,454
Those of us here, my colleagues,
we are anarchists.

2067
02:32:51,580 --> 02:32:53,540
We were part of the Resistance.

2068
02:32:53,665 --> 02:32:56,293
No one knows the quarries like us.

2069
02:32:56,418 --> 02:32:57,669
We fought and captured

2070
02:32:57,794 --> 02:33:02,007
many members
of the National Republican Army.

2071
02:33:02,132 --> 02:33:05,051
We trapped them in these caves.

2072
02:33:05,176 --> 02:33:08,346
And we dropped
these very same stones on them.

2073
02:33:54,059 --> 02:33:55,977
It is beautiful, no?

2074
02:33:59,856 --> 02:34:01,358
It is beautiful.

2075
02:34:03,401 --> 02:34:06,154
Exactly as you described,
László.

2076
02:34:18,792 --> 02:34:20,543
<i>Extraordinary.</i>

2077
02:34:36,518 --> 02:34:39,980
The channelling here
will be done in one month.

2078
02:34:41,940 --> 02:34:45,026
If you like it, we can have it fixed
and ready for you in April.

2079
02:34:47,195 --> 02:34:48,863
I'm so happy to see you again.

2080
02:34:48,989 --> 02:34:51,157
I am happy to see you,
old friend.

2081
02:34:51,282 --> 02:34:53,451
Such a life down the years.

2082
02:34:53,576 --> 02:34:55,161
And we are still here.

2083
02:34:55,996 --> 02:34:57,247
We like it.

2084
02:34:58,248 --> 02:34:59,457
We like it.

2085
02:35:11,845 --> 02:35:13,680
{\an8}
This is magic. Thank you.

2086
02:35:13,805 --> 02:35:15,390
{\an8}László, László,

2087
02:35:15,515 --> 02:35:17,475
{\an8}there will be
a big party tonight.

2088
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:19,978
I remember how much
you love a party.

2089
02:35:21,271 --> 02:35:22,689
Yeah.

2090
02:35:27,152 --> 02:35:33,033
♪ <i>You are my destiny</i>

2091
02:35:33,158 --> 02:35:38,663
<i>♪ You are too hard to me</i>

2092
02:35:38,788 --> 02:35:43,710
<i>♪ You are my happiness...</i>

2093
02:35:43,835 --> 02:35:44,961
I remember that.

2094
02:35:46,796 --> 02:35:49,382
Hey! Come, come.

2095
02:35:50,175 --> 02:35:53,303
This is my great old friend.

2096
02:35:53,803 --> 02:35:55,346
Good evening.

2097
02:35:55,889 --> 02:36:01,352
<i>♪ You share my loneliness ♪</i>

2098
02:36:01,478 --> 02:36:06,900
<i>♪ You're more than life to me ♪</i>

2099
02:36:07,025 --> 02:36:12,072
<i>♪ That's what you are ♪</i>

2100
02:36:14,491 --> 02:36:16,743
<i>♪ Heaven ♪</i>

2101
02:36:16,868 --> 02:36:20,622
♪ <i>And heaven alone can take ♪</i>

2102
02:36:20,747 --> 02:36:24,751
<i>♪ Your love from me ♪</i>

2103
02:36:24,876 --> 02:36:29,714
<i>♪ Would I be fool</i>
<i>to ever leave you, dear? ♪</i>

2104
02:36:29,839 --> 02:36:35,929
<i>♪ And a fool I'd ever be ♪</i>

2105
02:36:36,054 --> 02:36:41,768
<i>♪ You are my destiny ♪</i>

2106
02:36:41,893 --> 02:36:47,273
<i>♪ You share my reverie ♪</i>

2107
02:36:47,398 --> 02:36:53,113
<i>♪ You're more than life to me ♪</i>

2108
02:36:53,238 --> 02:36:58,284

02:37:23,393 --> 02:37:25,687

<i>♪ Your love from me ♪</i>

<i>♪ But I'd be a fool</i>
<i>to ever leave you, dear ♪</i>

2113
02:37:39,117 --> 02:37:44,622
<i>♪ And a fool I'd never be ♪</i>

2114
02:37:56,009 --> 02:37:57,385
Mr Tóth?

2115
02:38:02,515 --> 02:38:04,809
It's time we return
to our quarters.

2116
02:38:15,445 --> 02:38:18,990
Orazio has very kindly
offered us

2117
02:38:19,115 --> 02:38:22,118
a place to sleep for the night.

2118
02:38:29,209 --> 02:38:30,585
Mr Tóth?

2119
02:38:46,935 --> 02:38:48,978
What have you done to yourself?

2120
02:38:57,612 --> 02:38:59,489
It's a shame seeing how...

2121
02:39:01,241 --> 02:39:03,201
your people treat themselves.

2122
02:39:05,745 --> 02:39:07,288
If you resent your persecution,

2123
02:39:07,413 --> 02:39:11,084
why then do you make of yourself
such an easy target?

2124
02:39:12,293 --> 02:39:14,045
Hmm?

2125
02:39:15,380 --> 02:39:17,465
If you act as a loafer,

2126
02:39:18,841 --> 02:39:21,636
living off hand-outs...

2127
02:39:23,137 --> 02:39:24,889
a societal leech,

2128
02:39:26,224 --> 02:39:27,976
how can you...

2129
02:39:28,101 --> 02:39:31,521
how can you rightfully expect
a different result?

2130
02:39:34,941 --> 02:39:37,902
You... you have
so much potential.

2131
02:39:40,196 --> 02:39:41,948
But you squander it.

2132
02:39:53,876 --> 02:39:56,212
Get it out. Let it out.

2133
02:39:59,090 --> 02:40:01,676
Let it out. It's all right.

2134
02:40:07,432 --> 02:40:09,142
It's all right.

2135
02:40:13,146 --> 02:40:15,523
Who do you think you are?

2136
02:40:15,648 --> 02:40:17,233
Who do you think you are?

2137
02:40:17,358 --> 02:40:19,360
You think you're special?

2138
02:40:20,987 --> 02:40:23,406
You think you...

2139
02:40:23,531 --> 02:40:27,118
...you just float directly above
all those you encounter

2140
02:40:27,243 --> 02:40:29,662
because you're beautiful, huh?

2141
02:40:29,787 --> 02:40:32,582
Because you're educated?

2142
02:40:37,670 --> 02:40:39,213
You're just a tramp.

2143
02:40:40,131 --> 02:40:42,050
You're a lady of the night.

2144
02:40:42,175 --> 02:40:44,427
You're just a lady of the night.

2145
02:41:07,950 --> 02:41:14,791
♪ <i>That's what you are ♪♪</i>

2146
02:41:54,539 --> 02:41:56,541
You were in quite a state
last night.

2147
02:41:58,918 --> 02:42:00,837
Orazio carried you to bed.

2148
02:42:07,260 --> 02:42:10,596
It's a four-hour train
to the airport in Fiumicino.

2149
02:42:12,014 --> 02:42:14,350
So you'll have time for a rest.

2150
02:42:17,270 --> 02:42:20,231
I hope your stomach is not
too sensitive on aeroplanes.

2151
02:43:04,901 --> 02:43:07,653
<i>My dearest Zsófia! Mazel tov!</i>

2152
02:43:08,404 --> 02:43:11,657
<i>She is so beautiful.</i>
<i>Your spitting image!</i>

2153
02:43:15,661 --> 02:43:18,706
<i>Don't be mad,</i>
<i>but your Uncle László insisted</i>

2154
02:43:18,831 --> 02:43:21,417
<i>I enclose a few banknotes</i>
<i>for you and Binyamin.</i>

2155
02:43:22,084 --> 02:43:24,295
<i>We hope he won't be offended,</i>

2156
02:43:24,420 --> 02:43:25,713
<i>and that it's not too difficult</i>

2157
02:43:25,838 --> 02:43:27,840
<i>to change these</i>
<i>into the local currency.</i>

2158
02:43:34,472 --> 02:43:37,433
<i>Here, I am so alone.</i>

2159
02:43:39,101 --> 02:43:41,145
<i>Perhaps more alone</i>
<i>than I have ever been.</i>

2160
02:43:43,064 --> 02:43:45,858
<i>Your uncle closed a door to me.</i>

2161
02:43:46,692 --> 02:43:48,528
<i>The man I married is inside,</i>

2162
02:43:48,653 --> 02:43:52,365
<i>but the lock's combination</i>
<i>I cannot decipher...</i>

2163
02:43:55,326 --> 02:43:57,662
<i>Your uncle no longer attends synagogue.</i>

2164
02:43:59,622 --> 02:44:01,082
<i>He prefers to roam obsessively</i>

2165
02:44:01,207 --> 02:44:03,584
<i>through the corridors</i>
<i>of his construction in Doylestown.</i>

2166
02:44:06,879 --> 02:44:09,215
<i>There, at last, much progress</i>
<i>has been made,</i>

2167
02:44:09,340 --> 02:44:10,716
<i>yet he seems no more content</i>

2168
02:44:10,841 --> 02:44:13,844
<i>than on the day the Institute</i>
<i>first broke ground.</i>

2169
02:44:17,181 --> 02:44:19,100
<i>I suppose that inside,</i>

2170
02:44:19,225 --> 02:44:21,269
<i>he worships at the altar</i>
<i>of only himself.</i>

2171
02:44:23,354 --> 02:44:24,897
<i>Tell me how you are.</i>

2172
02:44:26,065 --> 02:44:27,608
<i>How you really are.</i>

2173
02:44:30,069 --> 02:44:34,115
<i>All our love and warmth</i>
<i>to the three of you.</i>

2174
02:44:35,825 --> 02:44:36,909
<i>Erzsébet.</i>

2175
02:45:10,067 --> 02:45:12,236
You see this, above us?

2176
02:45:12,361 --> 02:45:13,738
Measure the same distance

2177
02:45:13,863 --> 02:45:17,199
of three or perhaps four inches
between flats,

2178
02:45:17,325 --> 02:45:20,661
and place each modular section
apart by that same distance.

2179
02:45:21,537 --> 02:45:23,372
Then what do we do
with the gaps?

2180
02:45:25,791 --> 02:45:30,880
We insert a thick sheet of glass
between the panels

2181
02:45:31,005 --> 02:45:33,007
to let the light in from above.

2182
02:45:35,635 --> 02:45:38,471
Give me some time to think about
it and I'll come back to you.

2183
02:45:38,596 --> 02:45:39,972
Twenty-two.

2184
02:45:40,097 --> 02:45:41,891
- Twenty-three.
- What's going on here?

2185
02:45:42,016 --> 02:45:43,559
Twenty-four.

2186
02:45:43,684 --> 02:45:45,394
Twenty-five.

2187
02:45:45,519 --> 02:45:47,021
Twenty-six.

2188
02:45:47,146 --> 02:45:48,689
Twenty-seven.

2189
02:45:48,814 --> 02:45:50,483
Twenty-eight.

2190
02:45:50,608 --> 02:45:52,443
Twenty-nine.

2191
02:45:52,568 --> 02:45:54,195
Thirty.

2192
02:45:54,320 --> 02:45:55,946
- Thirty-one
- Stop it right now!

2193
02:45:56,072 --> 02:45:58,574
- Thirty-two.
- Stop it! Stop it right now!

2194
02:45:58,699 --> 02:46:01,369
What is your name, huh?

2195
02:46:01,494 --> 02:46:04,205
Are you stupid? You want
to pull this whole thing down?

2196
02:46:04,330 --> 02:46:05,748
Want to get them all killed?

2197
02:46:05,873 --> 02:46:09,210
Your childish show-boating
puts everyone else here at risk!

2198
02:46:09,335 --> 02:46:11,087
Do you hear me?

2199
02:46:11,212 --> 02:46:12,880
Are you thick? Are you lame?

2200
02:46:13,005 --> 02:46:16,175
Gordon, can you get him
to stop shouting at everyone?

2201
02:46:17,927 --> 02:46:19,220
I will.

2202
02:46:21,389 --> 02:46:23,182
You report to the subcontractor.

2203
02:46:23,307 --> 02:46:25,685
You tell him
that you've been let go.

2204
02:46:28,437 --> 02:46:29,647
- Get out of here!
- Hey!

2205
02:46:29,772 --> 02:46:31,315
What's wrong with you, László?

2206
02:46:31,440 --> 02:46:32,775
You kicked that boy.

2207
02:46:33,943 --> 02:46:35,361
Stay out of it, Gordon.

2208
02:46:36,529 --> 02:46:39,657
- What's wrong with you?
- Stay out of it.

2209
02:46:39,782 --> 02:46:41,826
Stay out of it,
or you can go with him!

2210
02:46:42,868 --> 02:46:45,788
You shout at me again
and you'll be sorry.

2211
02:46:48,457 --> 02:46:50,251
You too! You go!

2212
02:46:50,376 --> 02:46:52,253
Go! Get out of here.

2213
02:46:53,754 --> 02:46:55,005
Get out of here.

2214
02:46:57,758 --> 02:47:00,553
You think
I am playing games with you?

2215
02:47:04,724 --> 02:47:07,268
Let's go. Let's go.

2216
02:47:07,393 --> 02:47:09,186
I only just arrived.

2217
02:47:10,563 --> 02:47:12,773
- Mr Tóth.
- Oh, God.

2218
02:47:12,898 --> 02:47:15,317
Mr Tóth, we need to talk about
these May-June cost reports.

2219
02:47:15,443 --> 02:47:17,570
Not today, Jimmy, not today.

2220
02:47:17,695 --> 02:47:19,363
You can't keep
walking away from me

2221
02:47:19,488 --> 02:47:21,031
every time I step into a room.

2222
02:47:21,157 --> 02:47:23,451
This is not a room, Jim.

2223
02:47:23,576 --> 02:47:25,953
Honey, did I introduce you
to Jim Simpson?

2224
02:47:26,078 --> 02:47:28,247
Jim is the boss's lapdog

2225
02:47:28,372 --> 02:47:32,460
and architectural consultant
extraordinaire!

2226
02:47:32,585 --> 02:47:35,045
Jim designed a hotel
in Stamford.

2227
02:47:35,171 --> 02:47:36,797
László, that's enough.

2228
02:47:36,922 --> 02:47:39,425
Come on, Jimmy, there
must be an unpaid parking meter

2229
02:47:39,550 --> 02:47:41,635
around here somewhere, huh?

2230
02:47:41,761 --> 02:47:43,304
Be vigilant!

2231
02:47:44,638 --> 02:47:46,265
Keep your eyes peeled!

2232
02:47:48,768 --> 02:47:51,187
What is it, huh?

2233
02:47:51,896 --> 02:47:55,483
It was unnecessary
how you treated that boy is all.

2234
02:47:57,109 --> 02:47:59,695
Their safety is my priority.

2235
02:47:59,820 --> 02:48:02,156
It is not what you said
to that young man, it is how.

2236
02:48:02,281 --> 02:48:04,700
Gordon?
Don't even get me started.

2237
02:48:04,825 --> 02:48:07,411
Do you want to wait around
for another few years

2238
02:48:07,536 --> 02:48:11,874
for another lawsuit
to resolve itself?

2239
02:48:11,999 --> 02:48:15,127
Hmm? I am sick of it.

2240
02:48:15,252 --> 02:48:17,254
Sick! Do you hear me?

2241
02:48:18,506 --> 02:48:20,257
I finish this
or we are finished.

2242
02:48:20,382 --> 02:48:23,135
Speak for yourself.
I am not finished.

2243
02:48:23,260 --> 02:48:24,929
Living with you is impossible.

2244
02:48:25,054 --> 02:48:26,722
You've become
a selfish old bastard

2245
02:48:26,847 --> 02:48:28,140
right before my very eyes.

2246
02:48:28,265 --> 02:48:30,184
Don't say something
you'll regret in the morning.

2247
02:48:30,309 --> 02:48:33,395
Do you want to kill us?

2248
02:48:33,521 --> 02:48:36,482
I'd get out of the car and march
all the way back to Manhattan

2249
02:48:36,607 --> 02:48:39,151
if I could,
you egotistic scoundrel!

2250
02:48:40,236 --> 02:48:43,239
There is no reason
for me to be here.

2251
02:48:43,364 --> 02:48:47,368
I'm here for you. I could do
my ridiculous job anywhere!

2252
02:48:48,077 --> 02:48:49,537
Do you think
I went to university

2253
02:48:49,662 --> 02:48:51,497
to write about lipsticks?

2254
02:48:52,331 --> 02:48:53,707
Shame on you!

2255
02:48:53,833 --> 02:48:57,461
We came here
because it was our only option!

2256
02:49:00,172 --> 02:49:03,259
- Attila was here...
- Who you refuse to see!

2257
02:49:03,384 --> 02:49:06,345
Ask him about that! Ask him.

2258
02:49:07,263 --> 02:49:10,766
Did he tell you he kicked me
to the street like a dog?

2259
02:49:10,891 --> 02:49:12,226
Did he?

2260
02:49:12,351 --> 02:49:16,939
His bitch, bitch wife accused me
of making a pass at her.

2261
02:49:17,064 --> 02:49:19,775
- You would never do that.
- I did not do that.

2262
02:49:19,900 --> 02:49:21,777
Then why would she say
such a thing?

2263
02:49:21,902 --> 02:49:23,529
Because
they do not want us here.

2264
02:49:23,654 --> 02:49:25,823
Of course Attila wants us here.

2265
02:49:25,948 --> 02:49:27,783
- Not Attila.
- Then who do you mean?

2266
02:49:27,908 --> 02:49:31,245
The people here.
They do not want us here.

2267
02:49:33,664 --> 02:49:38,878
Audrey, Attila's Catholic wife,
does not want us here!

2268
02:49:39,753 --> 02:49:41,630
She does not want us here!

2269
02:49:46,719 --> 02:49:48,220
We are nothing.

2270
02:49:51,640 --> 02:49:53,142
We are worse than nothing.

2271
02:49:54,810 --> 02:49:56,228
You poor man.

2272
02:49:57,938 --> 02:49:59,648
My poor husband.

2273
02:50:02,776 --> 02:50:03,819
Oh, dear.

2274
02:50:05,237 --> 02:50:07,072
What has been robbed of you?

2275
02:50:12,912 --> 02:50:14,663
- Zsófia!
- Shh.

2276
02:50:14,788 --> 02:50:16,373
- Zsófia!
- She's not here, darling.

2277
02:50:16,498 --> 02:50:17,583
She's not here.

2278
02:50:17,708 --> 02:50:20,210
- Zsó...
- Sorry I upset you. Please.

2279
02:50:20,336 --> 02:50:24,673
Get me my pills.

2280
02:50:24,798 --> 02:50:27,760
It's too much.

2281
02:50:27,885 --> 02:50:31,180
I'm in pain! I'm close to death!

2282
02:50:37,394 --> 02:50:38,979
Darling?

2283
02:50:39,104 --> 02:50:41,774
There is only a pill
cut in halves.

2284
02:50:41,899 --> 02:50:43,901
Do you have more in your purse?

2285
02:50:44,026 --> 02:50:46,528
I can't.

2286
02:50:46,654 --> 02:50:48,364
Darling.

2287
02:50:48,489 --> 02:50:50,991
Take this, please.
Do you have more in your purse?

2288
02:50:52,826 --> 02:50:53,953
No?

2289
02:50:55,412 --> 02:50:57,456
This is too much.

2290
02:50:57,581 --> 02:50:59,041
What will I do?

2291
02:50:59,166 --> 02:51:01,752
The pain.
This is too much, László.

2292
02:51:01,877 --> 02:51:05,005
Shh.

2293
02:51:18,560 --> 02:51:21,188
Darling,
I have found something.

2294
02:51:25,609 --> 02:51:28,988
Darling, come on.
Shh. Shh.

2295
02:51:32,324 --> 02:51:36,578
It's what they gave me
on the boat for my broken face.

2296
02:51:41,250 --> 02:51:42,918
It'll help you feel better.

2297
02:51:43,043 --> 02:51:45,671
Just listen to my voice, dear.

2298
02:51:47,715 --> 02:51:49,883
That's it.
Just listen to my voice.

2299
02:51:52,011 --> 02:51:54,346
Listen to my voice.

2300
02:51:55,514 --> 02:51:56,849
There you go.

2301
02:51:58,225 --> 02:52:00,144
Listen to my voice.

2302
02:52:01,603 --> 02:52:03,814
There you go. Shh.

2303
02:52:05,357 --> 02:52:07,443
Listen to my voice.

2304
02:52:07,568 --> 02:52:08,986
Good, my dear.

2305
02:52:11,071 --> 02:52:12,448
There you go.

2306
02:52:14,408 --> 02:52:15,826
There you go.

2307
02:52:24,043 --> 02:52:25,169
Good.

2308
02:52:27,421 --> 02:52:29,882
Listen to my voice, darling.

2309
02:52:37,181 --> 02:52:40,476
Do... do you have more?

2310
02:53:05,584 --> 02:53:06,668
I love you.

2311
02:53:09,797 --> 02:53:12,132
I love you.

2312
02:53:17,429 --> 02:53:18,847
Keep going.

2313
02:53:19,807 --> 02:53:21,391
Yes.

2314
02:53:23,727 --> 02:53:25,813
I love you.

2315
02:53:27,147 --> 02:53:28,524
Harder.

2316
02:54:10,649 --> 02:54:11,817
More.

2317
02:54:12,776 --> 02:54:14,194
More.

2318
02:55:09,249 --> 02:55:10,584
Toilet.

2319
02:55:18,091 --> 02:55:19,301
Toilet.

2320
02:55:20,719 --> 02:55:22,012
Yes, dear.

2321
02:55:24,473 --> 02:55:25,474
Yes.

2322
02:55:30,771 --> 02:55:32,940
Up. Come, my dear.

2323
02:55:33,065 --> 02:55:34,983
Oh. Yeah.

2324
02:55:35,108 --> 02:55:36,485
Come on.

2325
02:55:36,610 --> 02:55:38,070
Come...

2326
02:55:41,323 --> 02:55:43,367
Oh. All right?

2327
02:55:43,492 --> 02:55:44,993
I'll wait outside.

2328
02:55:45,661 --> 02:55:48,288
OK? You tell me
when you need me.

2329
02:56:12,854 --> 02:56:14,022
Darling?

2330
02:56:16,775 --> 02:56:18,193
Have you finished?

2331
02:56:22,781 --> 02:56:24,616
Darling, can I come in?

2332
02:56:28,036 --> 02:56:30,455
Darling? Erzsébet?

2333
02:56:30,580 --> 02:56:33,375
Help. Help me. Help.

2334
02:56:33,500 --> 02:56:35,919
I need a gurney,
a stretcher! Anything! Anything!

2335
02:56:36,044 --> 02:56:38,213
Help me.
Help, my wife is dying.

2336
02:56:38,338 --> 02:56:40,048
She'll be all right.
OK, OK, OK.

2337
02:56:40,173 --> 02:56:42,509
- My wife is dying.
- She'll be all right.

2338
02:56:42,634 --> 02:56:44,553
Quickly, quickly, quickly!

2339
02:56:44,678 --> 02:56:46,722
My wife, she's dying.

2340
02:57:24,885 --> 02:57:27,137
Last night, I met God.

2341
02:57:28,305 --> 02:57:31,725
He granted me permission
to call Him by His name.

2342
02:57:34,353 --> 02:57:36,855
It's not the first time
we have met.

2343
02:57:40,692 --> 02:57:43,362
What did you do to me,
my László?

2344
02:57:46,656 --> 02:57:48,658
It was an accident.

2345
02:57:54,081 --> 02:57:57,042
Do you remember everything
you confessed to me

2346
02:57:57,167 --> 02:57:58,919
at home in our bed?

2347
02:58:05,175 --> 02:58:08,470
You needn't be ashamed,
my darling.

2348
02:58:09,930 --> 02:58:11,390
The harm done unto us

2349
02:58:11,515 --> 02:58:14,351
was done only
to our physical bodies.

2350
02:58:16,186 --> 02:58:17,646
You were right.

2351
02:58:19,856 --> 02:58:21,983
This place is rotten.

2352
02:58:23,360 --> 02:58:26,613
The landscape, the food we eat,

2353
02:58:26,738 --> 02:58:29,282
this whole country is rotten.

2354
02:58:32,119 --> 02:58:36,665
I'm going to Israel
to be with Zsófia and her child.

2355
02:58:38,166 --> 02:58:40,752
I want to become
the grandmother to her

2356
02:58:40,877 --> 02:58:43,797
that she will otherwise
never encounter.

2357
02:58:50,512 --> 02:58:52,264
Come home with me.

2358
02:58:58,395 --> 02:59:00,147
Come home with me.

2359
02:59:04,025 --> 02:59:05,652
I will follow you.

2360
02:59:08,655 --> 02:59:11,116
I follow you until I die.

2361
03:00:18,391 --> 03:00:20,352
Mrs Tóth.

2362
03:00:20,477 --> 03:00:22,979
You're standing.
How lovely to see.

2363
03:00:23,104 --> 03:00:25,398
- Do you need a hand?
- I'm all right, thank you.

2364
03:00:25,524 --> 03:00:27,234
Is Mr Tóth here as well?

2365
03:00:27,359 --> 03:00:29,528
- Just me, I'm afraid.
- Oh.

2366
03:00:29,653 --> 03:00:31,863
To what do we owe the pleasure?

2367
03:00:31,988 --> 03:00:33,907
Is your father in?

2368
03:00:34,032 --> 03:00:36,409
Sure. We were just
sitting down for dinner.

2369
03:00:36,535 --> 03:00:40,205
No trouble at all, I'm happy to
wait until you're all finished.

2370
03:00:41,498 --> 03:00:44,668
Don't be silly. I'll ask
the kitchen to fix you a plate.

2371
03:00:45,585 --> 03:00:48,880
You're kind, Maggie. Thank you.

2372
03:00:50,048 --> 03:00:52,509
Follow me.

2373
03:00:56,221 --> 03:00:58,598
You can finally meet my fiancé.

2374
03:01:02,644 --> 03:01:04,938
Are you sure
you don't need a hand?

2375
03:01:05,063 --> 03:01:06,147
Fine.

2376
03:01:09,234 --> 03:01:11,027
Mrs Tóth.

2377
03:01:11,152 --> 03:01:12,487
You're up on your feet.

2378
03:01:12,612 --> 03:01:15,198
Please, sit.

2379
03:01:16,324 --> 03:01:17,617
Where's László?

2380
03:01:20,036 --> 03:01:21,955
He's caught a flu.

2381
03:01:22,664 --> 03:01:24,416
He's recovering at home.

2382
03:01:24,541 --> 03:01:26,543
Well, that explains it.

2383
03:01:26,668 --> 03:01:30,088
Jim Simpson mentioned he hadn't
been on site since last Friday.

2384
03:01:30,213 --> 03:01:33,049
- Shame.
- Yes.

2385
03:01:33,174 --> 03:01:35,343
A terrible shame.

2386
03:01:35,468 --> 03:01:37,429
It's going around.

2387
03:01:37,554 --> 03:01:39,931
Please. Sit down.

2388
03:01:40,056 --> 03:01:41,766
I'm fine to stand.

2389
03:01:43,560 --> 03:01:45,103
Fine to stand?

2390
03:01:46,896 --> 03:01:48,690
Is something wrong, Mrs Tóth?

2391
03:01:50,942 --> 03:01:54,988
Yes.
Something is wrong.

2392
03:01:57,991 --> 03:02:00,619
I have come tonight
to tell you something

2393
03:02:00,744 --> 03:02:03,580
that is going to be
very difficult to hear.

2394
03:02:05,915 --> 03:02:07,751
For you people, too.

2395
03:02:09,878 --> 03:02:14,674
I don't know you, but it will
be difficult for you to hear.

2396
03:02:15,675 --> 03:02:17,385
If this
is a professional matter,

2397
03:02:17,510 --> 03:02:20,221
then perhaps you and I should
talk in the other room.

2398
03:02:22,599 --> 03:02:24,893
Your father is a rapist.

2399
03:02:28,313 --> 03:02:29,773
Excuse me?

2400
03:02:32,484 --> 03:02:35,445
Whatever this is
supposed to be, I don't like it.

2401
03:02:36,571 --> 03:02:38,490
I'm calling your husband
to come and fetch you.

2402
03:02:38,615 --> 03:02:41,785
Your father is an evil rapist.

2403
03:02:42,786 --> 03:02:45,413
Daddy,
what is she talking about?

2404
03:02:45,538 --> 03:02:46,915
Look at him.

2405
03:02:48,041 --> 03:02:50,460
He cannot say anything.

2406
03:02:53,171 --> 03:02:55,298
Did something happen
between you and Mrs Tóth?

2407
03:02:55,423 --> 03:02:58,301
- It wasn't me.
- That's enough!

2408
03:02:59,052 --> 03:03:02,555
You come in here making vague,
laughable accusations.

2409
03:03:02,681 --> 03:03:05,058
I want you out of our house
this instant.

2410
03:03:05,183 --> 03:03:08,728
Tell them
what you did to my husband.

2411
03:03:09,688 --> 03:03:11,940
Tell them what you did.

2412
03:03:16,653 --> 03:03:18,363
Your husband is sick.

2413
03:03:19,155 --> 03:03:21,825
He's alcoholic. Drug-addicted.

2414
03:03:22,826 --> 03:03:26,996
I don't know why he wishes
to hurt me, to humiliate me.

2415
03:03:28,373 --> 03:03:30,959
I have offered him
nothing but kindness.

2416
03:03:31,751 --> 03:03:35,338
He's a sick, senile old dog

2417
03:03:36,506 --> 03:03:38,925
and when dogs get sick, they...

2418
03:03:39,592 --> 03:03:42,637
they often bite the hand
of those who fed them,

2419
03:03:42,762 --> 03:03:45,640
until someone mercifully
puts them down.

2420
03:03:47,517 --> 03:03:51,396
Now, if you will excuse me...

2421
03:03:53,022 --> 03:03:56,860
I think I've endured enough
abuse for one evening.

2422
03:03:56,985 --> 03:03:58,987
You can tell your husband

2423
03:03:59,112 --> 03:04:01,448
he is off the payroll
now and forever as well.

2424
03:04:01,573 --> 03:04:03,700
I will not excuse you!

2425
03:04:03,825 --> 03:04:05,744
- Get out!
- No!

2426
03:04:05,869 --> 03:04:08,329
Harry!
Harry, let her go!

2427
03:04:09,456 --> 03:04:14,669
You are not excused,
Harrison Van Buren!

2428
03:04:15,670 --> 03:04:17,172
- Shame!
- Out!

2429
03:04:17,297 --> 03:04:18,798
Shame on you!

2430
03:04:19,674 --> 03:04:22,969
Mrs Tóth, I'm sorry.
Mrs Tóth.

2431
03:04:24,721 --> 03:04:25,889
Here.

2432
03:04:26,014 --> 03:04:28,391
- I'm fine.
- Sorry. I'm so sorry.

2433
03:04:28,516 --> 03:04:30,059
Can you help me to my car?

2434
03:04:30,185 --> 03:04:31,603
Yes. Sure.

2435
03:04:32,437 --> 03:04:34,522
Taxi is waiting
for me at the front.

2436
03:04:36,357 --> 03:04:39,569
I'm so sorry for the
bizarre interruption, gentlemen.

2437
03:04:40,653 --> 03:04:42,822
Harry, Harry, we're leaving.

2438
03:04:42,947 --> 03:04:45,450
No! No, don't leave. Please.

2439
03:04:45,575 --> 03:04:48,536
Harry, your father's gone to bed
anyhow.

2440
03:04:58,797 --> 03:05:00,423
What have you done?

2441
03:05:06,721 --> 03:05:07,972
Father?

2442
03:05:10,892 --> 03:05:12,477
Father?

2443
03:05:15,188 --> 03:05:16,815
It's over now.

2444
03:05:28,910 --> 03:05:31,454
Father! She's gone.

2445
03:05:37,418 --> 03:05:39,003
Dad?

2446
03:05:40,922 --> 03:05:42,090
Dad?

2447
03:05:45,593 --> 03:05:48,471
Where the hell has he gone?
Call for him outside.

2448
03:05:54,352 --> 03:05:55,562
Dad?

2449
03:05:59,023 --> 03:06:00,108
Dad!

2450
03:06:03,361 --> 03:06:04,737
Harrison!

2451
03:06:06,948 --> 03:06:08,366
Harrison!

2452
03:06:09,826 --> 03:06:12,620
He must have left the house,
I can't find him anywhere.

2453
03:06:15,790 --> 03:06:17,041
Daddy!

2454
03:06:19,544 --> 03:06:20,587
Harrison!

2455
03:06:23,172 --> 03:06:25,300
Mr Van Buren!

2456
03:06:25,425 --> 03:06:26,885
Harrison!

2457
03:06:28,469 --> 03:06:29,888
Mr Van Buren!

2458
03:06:32,974 --> 03:06:34,726
Father!

2459
03:06:34,851 --> 03:06:36,102
Dad!

2460
03:06:38,688 --> 03:06:40,231
Daddy!

2461
03:06:40,356 --> 03:06:42,233
Shine a bit more light
on this side here.

2462
03:06:48,948 --> 03:06:50,533
Harrison!

2463
03:07:05,715 --> 03:07:07,133
Van Buren!

2464
03:07:09,218 --> 03:07:10,678
You see anything?

2465
03:07:17,852 --> 03:07:19,312
There's a door there.

2466
03:07:23,441 --> 03:07:25,735
It's locked!
Can't get inside!

2467
03:07:36,287 --> 03:07:39,040
Give us the telephone
number for a groundskeeper.

2468
03:08:04,607 --> 03:08:06,234
What is this place?

2469
03:08:06,359 --> 03:08:08,111
It's the condensate
return system

2470
03:08:08,236 --> 03:08:09,696
and the drain pumps.

2471
03:08:25,128 --> 03:08:26,546
Harrison!

2472
03:08:46,566 --> 03:08:48,860
Think we've got something
over here, Lieutenant.

2473
03:09:57,929 --> 03:10:02,058
Turn that music down!

2474
03:11:11,419 --> 03:11:13,796
They look beautiful
like this, don't you think?

2475
03:11:27,351 --> 03:11:29,187
Excuse us, sir.

2476
03:12:32,959 --> 03:12:34,418
Good evening.

2477
03:12:44,387 --> 03:12:49,767
My uncle is, above all,
a principled artist.

2478
03:12:52,270 --> 03:12:57,149
His lifelong ambition
was not only to define an epoch,

2479
03:12:57,275 --> 03:12:59,443
but to transcend all time.

2480
03:13:00,945 --> 03:13:05,324
In his memoirs, he described
his designs as machines

2481
03:13:05,449 --> 03:13:07,702
with no superfluous parts.

2482
03:13:07,827 --> 03:13:12,790
That, at their best,
at his best,

2483
03:13:14,125 --> 03:13:17,003
possessed an immoveable core,

2484
03:13:17,128 --> 03:13:19,005
a hard core of beauty.

2485
03:13:20,089 --> 03:13:24,176
A way of directing their
inhabitants' perception

2486
03:13:24,302 --> 03:13:26,429
into the world as it is.

2487
03:13:26,554 --> 03:13:29,265
The inherent laws
of concrete things

2488
03:13:29,390 --> 03:13:33,185
such as mountains
and rock define them.

2489
03:13:33,311 --> 03:13:35,730
They indicate nothing.

2490
03:13:35,855 --> 03:13:37,565
They tell nothing.

2491
03:13:37,690 --> 03:13:39,400
They simply are.

2492
03:13:39,525 --> 03:13:44,155
Born in 1911 in a small fishing
village in Austria-Hungary,

2493
03:13:44,280 --> 03:13:47,533
László Tóth looked out
upon the Adriatic Sea.

2494
03:13:47,658 --> 03:13:51,495
He was a boy with eyes
wide open, full of yearning.

2495
03:13:51,620 --> 03:13:53,247
New borders would eventually

2496
03:13:53,372 --> 03:13:56,500
rip this expanse of sea
away from him,

2497
03:13:56,625 --> 03:14:00,796
but never did he stop
to try and fill its void.

2498
03:14:00,921 --> 03:14:04,258
Forty years later, he survived
the camp at Buchenwald,

2499
03:14:04,383 --> 03:14:08,179
as did his late wife,
and myself, in Dachau.

2500
03:14:08,304 --> 03:14:10,473
His first American masterpiece,

2501
03:14:10,598 --> 03:14:13,934
the Van Buren Institute
outside of Philadelphia,

2502
03:14:14,060 --> 03:14:17,438
remained unfinished until 1973.

2503
03:14:17,563 --> 03:14:21,192
The building referenced
his time at Buchenwald,

2504
03:14:21,317 --> 03:14:25,821
as well as the deeply felt
absence of his wife,

2505
03:14:25,946 --> 03:14:28,074
my aunt, Erzsébet.

2506
03:14:29,158 --> 03:14:30,743
For this project,

2507
03:14:30,868 --> 03:14:35,039
he re-imagined the camp's
claustrophobic interior cells

2508
03:14:35,164 --> 03:14:37,375
with precisely
the same dimensions

2509
03:14:37,500 --> 03:14:40,211
as his own place
of imprisonment,

2510
03:14:40,336 --> 03:14:43,422
save for one
electrifying exception.

2511
03:14:45,091 --> 03:14:48,427
When visitors looked
20 metres upwards,

2512
03:14:48,552 --> 03:14:52,056
the dramatic heights
of the glass roof above them

2513
03:14:52,181 --> 03:14:55,267
invited free thought,
freedom of identity.

2514
03:14:55,393 --> 03:14:58,312
He further re-imagined
Buchenwald

2515
03:14:58,437 --> 03:15:02,483
and his wife's venue
of imprisonment, Dachau,

2516
03:15:02,608 --> 03:15:04,360
on the same grounds,

2517
03:15:05,903 --> 03:15:08,697
connected by a myriad
of secret corridors,

2518
03:15:08,823 --> 03:15:13,619
re-writing their history,
transcending space and time,

2519
03:15:13,744 --> 03:15:16,997
so that he and Erzsébet
would never be apart again.

2520
03:15:19,208 --> 03:15:20,418
Uncle...

2521
03:15:21,877 --> 03:15:24,463
you and Aunt Erzsébet
once spoke for me.

2522
03:15:24,588 --> 03:15:28,467
I speak for you now,
and am honoured.

2523
03:15:28,592 --> 03:15:31,762
"Don't let anyone fool you,
Zsófia," he would say to me

2524
03:15:31,887 --> 03:15:36,058
as a struggling young mother
raising my daughter

2525
03:15:36,183 --> 03:15:38,727
during our first years
in Jerusalem.

2526
03:15:39,812 --> 03:15:42,731
"No matter what the others
try and tell you,

2527
03:15:44,191 --> 03:15:48,320
it is the destination,
not the journey."

2528
03:15:51,407 --> 03:15:52,658
Thank you.
