1
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:31,611
Sonny, hit me up with some syrup.

2
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,409
- Ma'am?
- Yeah, I'll be right with you.

3
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:43,289
Here you go. You got the sausage,
and pancakes for you.

4
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:44,833
And here's your syrup.

5
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,709
He's over there.

6
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:53,132
- Decaf or regular?
- Regular, please.

7
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:55,218
You girls are kinda young to be smoking,
don't you think?

8
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,470
Ruins your sex drive.

9
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:11,526
I'll get it!

10
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:14,988
I got it!

11
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,072
Hello?

12
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:17,991
Hey, how you doing, little housewife?

13
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:19,826
You all packed?
We're out of here tonight.

14
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,453
Well, wait now.
I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.

15
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:25,039
You mean you haven't asked him yet?

16
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,542
Thelma, for Christ's sake!

17
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,169
Thelma, is he your husband or your father?

18
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:32,505
It is just two days, for God's sake.

19
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:35,675
Don't be a child.
Tell him you're going with me.

20
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:37,802
Tell him I'm having a nervous breakdown.

21
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:41,222
That don't carry much weight with Darryl.
He already thinks you're out of your mind.

22
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,893
- Are you at work?
- No, I'm calling from the Playboy Mansion.

23
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:46,269
Call you right back.

24
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:48,938
Darryl?

25
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,358
Darryl!

26
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:54,193
Honey, you better hurry up!

27
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:01,117
Goddamn it, Thelma.

28
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,620
Don't holler like that.

29
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,205
Shit.

30
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:10,752
Haven't I told you I can't stand it
when you holler in the morning?

31
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:14,088
I'm sorry, doll.
I just didn't want you to be late.

32
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:15,673
Thank you.

33
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,513
- Hon?
- What?

34
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:28,144
Have a good day at work today.

35
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:32,774
- Jesus.
- Here.

36
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:34,150
Thank you, no.

37
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,239
- Hon?
- What?

38
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,743
You want anything special
for dinner tonight?

39
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:48,623
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit
what we have for dinner.

40
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:52,835
I may not even make it home for dinner.
You know how Fridays are.

41
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:57,799
Yeah, funny how so many people
want to buy a carpet on a Friday night.

42
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:01,636
You'd almost think they'd want to
forget about it for the weekend.

43
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:07,016
Well, then it's a good thing
you're not regional manager

44
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:09,435
and I am.

45
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:12,939
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

46
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:16,067
For Christ's sake,
I got to get the hell out of here.

47
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:18,403
Jesus!

48
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:20,738
Goddamn it, Homer!

49
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:22,699
Christ, I gotta get to work!

50
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:25,284
Don't need this bullshit in the morning!

51
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,537
Just leave 'em. I'll get 'em.
Thank you.

52
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,914
For Christ's sakes.

53
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:37,839
And I want you out of here by 5:00.
No, 3:00. Get out of here by 3:00 today.

54
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:45,471
Good morning.

55
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:49,058
- Morning. Is Louise there?
- Why, yes, she is.

56
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:52,061
Is this Thelma?
When are you gonna run away with me?

57
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:54,147
Not this weekend.
She's running away with me.

58
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,231
Hey, what did he say?

59
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,025
What time are you picking me up?

60
00:05:57,108 --> 00:06:00,236
All right!
I'll be there around 2:00 or 3:00.

61
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,320
Okay.

62
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:03,197
Hey, say, what kind of stuff do I bring?

63
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:05,199
Oh, I don't know. Warm stuff, I guess.

64
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:08,953
It's the mountains. It gets cold at night.
I'm just gonna bring everything.

65
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:11,539
Okay. I will too then.

66
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:15,418
- And steal Darryl's fishing stuff.
- Louise, I don't know how to fish.

67
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,379
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it.
How hard can it be?

68
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,632
- All right, I'll see you in a bit.
- Okay.

69
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:22,967
Okay, bye.

70
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:23,736
Hi, this is Jimmy.
I'm not here right now.

71
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:51,597
- Hey.
- Hey.

72
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,478
No, Thelma, we don't need the lantern.
The place has electricity.

73
00:07:57,562 --> 00:07:59,397
Okay. No, I want to take it anyway.

74
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,023
- Just in case.
- In case of what?

75
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:04,068
In case there's some escaped
psycho killer on the loose

76
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:08,573
who cuts the electricity off
and tries to come in and kill us.

77
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:11,993
Sure, Thelma. Well, then
that lantern'll come in real handy.

78
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:15,204
Maybe we should
just tow your car behind too

79
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:17,081
in case he steals the spark plugs.

80
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,542
We'd have to. That thing barely makes it
down the driveway.

81
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:39,812
- Careful. Careful.
- Okay.

82
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,982
- All right. Everything in?
- Yeah.

83
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,650
Careful. Here you go.

84
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,694
- Be careful!
- All right.

85
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,322
Smile.

86
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:54,035
Yeah! See you later!

87
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:57,622
Sit down!

88
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,334
Oh, Louise?

89
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:04,503
- Will you take care of this gun?
- What in hell did you bring that for?

90
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:08,090
Oh, come on.
Psycho killers or bears or snakes.

91
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:09,967
I just don't know how to use it.
Will you take care of it?

92
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:12,720
Put it awa...
Just... Here. Put it in my purse.

93
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,348
Thelma, good Lord.

94
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:25,274
- So whose place is this again?
- It's Bob's, the day manager's.

95
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:27,109
He's gettin' a divorce.
His wife's gettin' this place.

96
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:30,947
So he's lettin' all his friends use it
till he's gotta turn over the keys.

97
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,577
I've never been out of town
without Darryl.

98
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:38,371
How come Darryl let you go?

99
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:41,332
'Cause I didn't ask him.

100
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,084
Shit, Thelma.

101
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,212
Why... He's gon' kill you!

102
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,714
Well, he'd never let me go.

103
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:52,260
He never lets me do one goddamn thing
that's any fun.

104
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:55,221
All he wants me to do is
hang around the house the whole time

105
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,014
while he's out doing God only knows what.

106
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,892
Well, you get what you settle for.

107
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:04,063
I left him a note.

108
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:07,566
I left him stuff to microwave.

109
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,591
- Thelma.
- What?

110
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,158
- Thelma, what are you doin'?
- Smoking.

111
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:02,163
Hey. I'm Louise.

112
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:11,964
I'll never make it.
Can't we just stop somewhere for a minute?

113
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:15,134
Thelma, we're not gonna get to the cabin
till after dark as it is.

114
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,595
Then what difference would it make
if we stopped?

115
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,181
Come on.
I never get to do stuff like this.

116
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:23,642
- Okay. But it's gonna be a quick stop.
- Fine. Okay.

117
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,642
I haven't seen a place like this
since I left Texas.

118
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:05,976
Isn't this fun?

119
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,118
- Y'all want a drink?
- No, thanks.

120
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:25,287
I'll have a Wild Turkey straight up
and a Coke back, please.

121
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:26,872
Thelma!

122
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:29,917
Oh, what? Tell me something.
Is this my vacation or isn't it?

123
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,586
I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.

124
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,381
I'm sorry. It's just I'm not used to
seeing you this way.

125
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:39,009
I haven't seen you this way in a while.
You're usually so sedate.

126
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,887
Well, I've had it up to my ass
with sedate.

127
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,598
You said you and me
was gonna get out of town

128
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:47,101
and, for once,
just really let our hair down.

129
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:50,771
Well, darlin', look out,
'cause my hair is coming down.

130
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,815
All right. I've changed my mind.

131
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:57,445
I'm gonna have a margarita
and a shot of Cuervo on the side.

132
00:12:58,112 --> 00:12:59,655
- Okay.
- All right! Get me another one.

133
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:04,910
Hey.

134
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:08,747
Now, what are a couple of Kewpie dolls
like you doin' in a place like this?

135
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,459
- We left town for the weekend...
- Minding our business. Why don't you try?

136
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,543
To have some fun.

137
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:16,172
And 'cause Louise here is mad
at her boyfriend 'cause...

138
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:21,135
- We just wanted to get something to eat.
- Well, you've come to the right place.

139
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,637
Do you like chili? They got good chili.

140
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,266
Harlan, you botherin' these poor girls?

141
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,268
Hell, no. I was just bein' friendly.

142
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:32,646
Well, it's a good thing
they're not all as friendly as you.

143
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:36,859
Hey, your name's Harlan?
I got an uncle named Harlan.

144
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,068
You do?

145
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:39,653
Is he a funny uncle?

146
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:42,781
'Cause if he is,
then he and I got something in common.

147
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,954
I don't mean to be rude,

148
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:52,082
but I got something I got
to talk to my friend about in private.

149
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,169
I understand.
I didn't mean to bother you.

150
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:59,381
It's just hard not to notice
two such pretty ladies as yourselves.

151
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:06,138
You better dance with me before you leave,
or I will never forgive you.

152
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:08,015
Sure, that'd be fun.

153
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:13,979
Geez, Louise. That wasn't very nice.

154
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:16,190
Can't you tell
when somebody's hittin' on you?

155
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,442
Oh, so what if he was?

156
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:22,363
It's all your years of waiting tables
that's made you jaded, that's all.

157
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,447
Maybe.

158
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:25,449
Well, just relax, will you?

159
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,826
- You're making me nervous.
- All right!

160
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:47,096
<i>I woke up in a hotel,
I didn't know what to do</i>

161
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,473
<i>I turned the TV on
and wrote a letter to you...</i>

162
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:51,058
That's a good band.

163
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,769
<i>The news was talkin' 'bout a dragnet
up on the interstate</i>

164
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,357
<i>Seems they were looking for a Cadillac
with Tennessee plates...</i>

165
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,819
- Wonder if Darryl's home yet.
- Wonder if Jimmy's got back.

166
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,071
Why don't you just tell him to get lost
once and for all?

167
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,407
Why don't you ditch
that no-good husband of yours?

168
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,869
This one's on Harlan.

169
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,039
Thanks.

170
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,876
Well, look.

171
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,212
Jimmy will come in off the road
and you won't be there.

172
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:23,215
He'll freak out and call you like
a hundred thousand times.

173
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:24,592
Sunday night, you'll call him back,

174
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,760
and by Monday,
he'll be kissin' the ground you walk on.

175
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,429
Exactly.

176
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,806
In the meantime,
you said we was gonna have some fun,

177
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,600
so let's have some!

178
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,060
- All right.
- Okay.

179
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:46,947
All right.

180
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:52,828
Okay.

181
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,955
- Let's dance.
- All right.

182
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:04,214
<i>I woke up in a hotel,
I didn't know what to do</i>

183
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:07,134
<i>I turned the TV on,
and wrote a letter to you</i>

184
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:10,346
<i>The news was talkin' 'bout a dragnet
up on the interstate...</i>

185
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:13,140
Thelma. That's your name? Thelma?
That's a lovely name.

186
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,309
I don't know what I'm doing.

187
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,519
Follow me, Thelma.

188
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,940
- Ma'am, you wanna dance a little?
- Sure.

189
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:25,194
<i>Since I left California, baby,
things have gotten worse</i>

190
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:28,739
<i>Seems the land of opportunity,
for me is just a curse</i>

191
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,950
<i>Tell that judge in Bakersfield
my trial'll have to wait</i>

192
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:37,081
<i>Down here, they're looking
for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates</i>

193
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:40,334
<i>She saw him singing once
when she was 17...</i>

194
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,631
You got some great moves, honey.

195
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:50,135
<i>Anyway, he wouldn't care,
hell, he gave them to his friends...</i>

196
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,641
All right! Here we go!
Here we go! Here we go!

197
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:07,111
<i>Hey now, baby,
you lookin' so fine</i>

198
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:10,197
<i>Toolin' around in your Mercury '49</i>

199
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,324
<i>Crazy about a Mercury</i>

200
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:15,035
<i>Lord, I'm crazy about a Mercury</i>

201
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:21,917
<i>I'm gonna buy me a Mercury
and cruise it on down the road</i>

202
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,753
Hey, hey! Thelma!

203
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,172
- Oh, Louise.
- I'm hittin' the little girls' room.

204
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,965
And then we're out of here.

205
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,218
I'm ready when you are.

206
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,389
Wait, Louise, I want to come with you.

207
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:18,599
Come on there.

208
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:21,143
Turn around. Turn around.

209
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,519
- What?
- I don't feel so good.

210
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:23,854
What's wrong?

211
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,355
Come on.

212
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:28,400
- Shit. Stop!
- What for?

213
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,112
I'm spinning.

214
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,240
Oopsy-doopsy.

215
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:37,493
We need to get you some fresh air,
little lady.

216
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,895
Look, have you seen my friend?

217
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,439
Your friend? Yeah. Yeah.

218
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,566
She was out there dancing.
Dancing.

219
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:15,280
How you feeling now, darling?

220
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:16,615
Oh, thanks.

221
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,785
I think I'm starting
to feel a little better.

222
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,704
You're starting to feel pretty good
to me too.

223
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:24,373
- Hey.
- You know that?

224
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,291
I think I need to keep walking.

225
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,961
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

226
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,463
- Where do you think you're going, huh?
- I'm going back inside.

227
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:32,464
Oh, no, no.

228
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,675
- Harlan.
- What?

229
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,553
Hey, quit it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop.

230
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,264
Thelma, Thelma, listen to me.
Listen to me.

231
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:44,142
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
I just wanna kiss you. All right?

232
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:47,396
- No. No.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

233
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,526
- Goddamn, you are gorgeous.
- Let me go now. Come on.

234
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,612
- You're gorgeous.
- Let me go! I mean, I'm married!

235
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,698
- Come on.
- That's okay. I'm married too.

236
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,659
I don't feel good. I've been sick.

237
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,202
Listen to me.

238
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:04,580
I said I'm not gonna hurt you.
All right?

239
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,207
- Relax.
- Harlan, stop it, please! I mean it!

240
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,252
Wait, don't! I mean it!

241
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,920
Louise is gonna wonder where I am!

242
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,755
Fuck Louise! Fuck...

243
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,673
Hey!

244
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:18,760
Don't ever fuckin' hit me!

245
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,512
Fucking bitch!

246
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,974
- Harlan, please! Harlan, please!
- Do you hear me?

247
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,393
- Don't hurt me, Harlan, please!
- Shut up!

248
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,312
Shut the fuck up! You hear me?

249
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,438
Shut up!

250
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,648
Please. Please don't hurt me, Harlan!

251
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,442
Goddamn bitch!

252
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:35,777
Don't hurt me, Harlan!

253
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,113
- Let her go!
- Louise!

254
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,907
Get the fuck out of here.

255
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:43,994
Louise!

256
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,787
You let her go,
you fucking asshole,

257
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:48,498
or I'm gonna splatter your ugly face
all over this nice car.

258
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,471
All right.
Hey, hey, hey, just calm down.

259
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,765
We were just having a little fun,
that's all.

260
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:07,267
Looks like you got
a real fucked-up idea of fun.

261
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:12,064
Come on. Come on.

262
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,402
Turn around.

263
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,076
In the future,

264
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,079
when a woman's crying like that,

265
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,791
she isn't having any fun!

266
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,292
Come on.

267
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:36,880
- It's okay.
- Bitch!

268
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:39,257
I should've gone ahead and fucked her!

269
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:43,345
What did you say?

270
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,764
I said, suck my cock.

271
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,564
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

272
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:57,025
- Get the car.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

273
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,194
Louise, you shot him.

274
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,071
- Oh, my God.
- Get the car.

275
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,416
You watch your mouth, buddy.

276
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:22,342
Louise, come on!

277
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,483
Watch it, you fucking asshole!

278
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:53,081
Louise?

279
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,798
Louise, where are we going?

280
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:04,051
I don't know. I don't know.

281
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,428
Just shut up so I can think.

282
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:12,392
Shouldn't we go to the cops?
I mean, I think we oughta tell the police.

283
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,770
Tell 'em what?
What do you think we should tell 'em?

284
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,981
I don't know.
Just tell 'em what happened.

285
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:19,775
Which part?

286
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:23,111
All of it.
That... That... That he was raping me.

287
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:26,740
A hundred goddamn people saw you dancin'
cheek to cheek with him all night!

288
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:30,285
Who's gonna believe that?
We don't live in that kind of a world!

289
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,204
Goddamn it, pull over!

290
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:15,664
All right.

291
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,626
Thelma.

292
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,589
Thelma?

293
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:30,887
Thelma, I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

294
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:35,892
I'm gonna stop someplace
for a cup of coffee and then...

295
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:39,688
just for a second...
and then I'm gonna get it together.

296
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,899
And we'll figure out then what to do.

297
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:46,736
And everything's gonna be fine,
all right?

298
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,115
Everything's gonna be...
All right?

299
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:13,513
Now is not the time to panic.
If we panic now, we're done for.

300
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:19,769
- Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.
- Okay.

301
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,688
So we're still okay.

302
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:26,526
We just have to figure out
what we're gonna do next.

303
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,446
We just have to figure out...

304
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,072
what we're gonna do.

305
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,701
I'll say one thing.

306
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,412
This is some vacation.

307
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:41,791
I sure am having a good time.
This is real fun.

308
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:45,170
If you weren't concerned
with having so much fun,

309
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:46,504
we wouldn't be here right now.

310
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:51,009
- Just what is that supposed to mean?
- It just means shut up, Thelma.

311
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:54,387
So this is all my fault, is it?

312
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:19,829
I have to go to the bathroom.

313
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,043
Sorry.

314
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:31,675
- Can I get you anything else?
- Just the check, please.

315
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:48,191
Thanks. I'll try again later.

316
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:51,945
Move back, people.

317
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,990
Stand away from the line, please.

318
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,868
No, it's secured until further notice.

319
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:05,166
Could you identify 'em
if you saw 'em again?

320
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,295
Oh, hell, I told you 50 times,
yeah, I could identify 'em.

321
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,214
But neither one of those two
was the type to pull somethin' like this.

322
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:13,925
Well, you're not exactly
an expert witness,

323
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:15,218
but what makes you so sure?

324
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:19,097
Oh, well, if waiting tables in a bar
don't make you an expert on human nature,

325
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,974
nothin' will.

326
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:24,894
I could've told you Harlan Puckett was
gonna end up buyin' it in a parking lot.

327
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:27,647
I'm just surprised
it didn't happen sooner than this.

328
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:30,275
- Who do you think did it?
- Has anybody asked his wife?

329
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:32,652
She's the one I hope did it.

330
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,613
Lena, do you have any ideas or don't you?

331
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:37,741
Well, if I had to guess,

332
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:40,160
I'd say it was some old gal,
some old gal's husband.

333
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,912
But it wasn't neither one of those two.

334
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:45,290
The smaller one,
the one with the tidy hairdo,

335
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:47,834
she left me a huge tip.

336
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:50,962
- Well...
- What?

337
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:54,341
You didn't happen to notice what kind
of car they were driving, did you?

338
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,136
It's a nightclub, Hal, not a drive-in.

339
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,889
I don't follow the customers
out to the parking lot.

340
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:02,265
- All right.
- All right.

341
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,601
Lena, go on home.

342
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:05,977
You kept me here all night

343
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,688
to ask me the same old question
over and over again?

344
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,943
Ain't you gonna offer me some teeny-eeny,
witty-bitty little drink?

345
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:17,238
Behave yourself.

346
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:21,826
Neither of those two
was the murdering type, Hal.

347
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,295
Hi, this is Jimmy.

348
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,306
Thelma, you in there?

349
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,362
Thelma, come on.
We're out of here, Thelma! Come on.

350
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:05,286
The Dow Jones dropped over 12 points
today, closing at 18...

351
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:07,997
We're gonna need money.

352
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:10,667
Thelma, how much money you have on you?

353
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,002
What?

354
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:17,715
I'm gonna stop at the next town.
We'll get a motel room.

355
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,552
I can rest for a little bit
and then I'll figure out what to do.

356
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:23,513
Okay. Wait. I'm looking.

357
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:29,310
Sixty-one dollars.

358
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,980
Shit.

359
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:35,650
Forty-one dollars.

360
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,112
We're gonna need more money.

361
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:42,699
What are you doing?
Why are you unpacking?

362
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:45,618
You said we was just gonna take a nap.

363
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:48,413
Well, I'm trying to figure out what to do.

364
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:51,916
Well...

365
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:56,546
When you figure it out, just wake me up.

366
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,384
What the hell's wrong with you?

367
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,344
What's that supposed to mean?

368
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:06,764
- I mean, why are you acting like this?
- Acting like what?

369
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,725
How am I supposed to act?

370
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:12,145
Excuse me for not knowin' how to act
when you blow somebody away!

371
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,272
You could help me try
to figure out what to do.

372
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:17,150
I'm trying to figure out what to do.
But you could try...

373
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:20,820
Try? I did! I had a suggestion
that we go to the police.

374
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:23,740
But you didn't like that,
so frankly, Louise, I'm out of ideas.

375
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:25,283
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma?

376
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:28,369
I mean, we give 'em enough time
they'll come to us.

377
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,635
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

378
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:46,513
I'm just not ready to go to jail yet,
okay?

379
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,435
Why don't you...

380
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:56,898
Why don't you go out to the pool
and take a swim or something, all right?

381
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,567
Now, I'll figure out what to do.

382
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:05,031
Jimmy, this is Louise.
Look, I've been trying to call you.

383
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:08,326
- Louise? Hey, baby.
- Hey.

384
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:11,454
Now, where the hell are you at?

385
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:14,249
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. How are you?

386
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:16,543
Long time no see.

387
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:20,797
- You sound kind of funny, Louise.
- I am funny. I'm real funny.

388
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,383
Are you in town?
It sounds long-distance.

389
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,844
No, I'm out of town. I'm in...

390
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:31,140
I'm in deep shit, Jimmy.
Deep Shit, Arkansas.

391
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:36,479
Louise, now you just tell me
what the hell's going on here.

392
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,983
I come back, nobody knows where you are.

393
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:43,611
- Is Thelma with you?
- Listen, Jimmy.

394
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:47,448
I have about $6,700 in the bank.

395
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,576
Now, I know you can't get it out...

396
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:52,579
but I need that money.

397
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:57,750
Can you wire me the $6,700
and I'll pay you back?

398
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:00,336
What the fuck is going on here, Louise?

399
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:02,463
Listen...

400
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:06,384
Something real bad has happened.

401
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:10,555
And I can't tell you what.

402
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:17,186
Just that I did it and I can't undo it.

403
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:22,817
Will you help me, please?

404
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,486
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby, of course I can.

405
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:28,906
But where?
Why can't I bring it to you?

406
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,207
Jimmy.

407
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,880
Do you love me?

408
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:50,928
Yeah.

409
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:53,222
- Never mind. Never mind. Never mind.
- Yeah, yeah.

410
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:54,724
Look, just...

411
00:32:56,476 --> 00:33:00,188
Just wire it to Western Union
in Oklahoma City, okay?

412
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:02,273
Oh, so that's where you're at.
Oklahoma, huh?

413
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:03,358
Not yet.

414
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:06,527
You call me back
and I'll tell you which office to go to.

415
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:10,823
All right. All right.
You call... I'll call you back in an hour.

416
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:15,536
Thelma!

417
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:24,462
Thelma!

418
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,758
Thelma! Thelma!

419
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,301
- What?
- Get in the car.

420
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:31,302
Okay.

421
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:55,201
Even if they didn't do it, it times out
they most likely witnessed it,

422
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:56,786
so somebody better talk to them.

423
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:59,747
Put out an APB and see what we get back.

424
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:01,416
All right.

425
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:03,668
Any reason to believe
they've left the state?

426
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:07,672
That's certainly possible.

427
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:11,175
Well, why don't we go ahead
and let the Bureau in on this?

428
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:26,524
Louise, don't get mad, okay,
but where are we going?

429
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:28,276
Oklahoma City.

430
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:30,319
Jimmy's gonna wire me some money
and then we're gonna...

431
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:31,279
Jimmy?

432
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:34,282
You talked to him? Did you tell him?
What did he say? Is he mad?

433
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:36,617
No, I didn't tell him.
That's what we gotta get straight.

434
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:40,246
Darryl's been calling, mad as a hornet,
making all kinds of noise.

435
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,874
And when you call him,

436
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:45,418
you gotta not tell him anything
about this.

437
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,503
You gotta just make sure
everything sounds real normal.

438
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:51,257
You know, I called the asshole
at four o'clock in the morning.

439
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,633
He wasn't even home.

440
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:55,595
I don't know what he's got
to be mad about.

441
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:57,638
I'm the one that should be mad.

442
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:01,601
Thelma.

443
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,562
I'm going to Mexico.

444
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:07,273
Now, I figure I can make it
in two and a half days,

445
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:09,317
but I'm gonna have to haul ass.

446
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:11,861
Are you up to this?

447
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:14,447
I mean, I gotta know.
This isn't a game.

448
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:18,117
I'm in deep shit,
and I gotta know what you're gonna do.

449
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:23,873
I don't know. I don't know, Louise.

450
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:26,083
I mean,
I don't know what you're asking.

451
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:29,170
Now, don't you start flaking out on me!
Goddamn it, Thelma.

452
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,880
Every time that we get in trouble,

453
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:35,843
you just get blank or...
or plead insanity or some such shit.

454
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:39,388
Not this time.
I mean, this time things have changed.

455
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:40,932
Everything's changed.

456
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:46,562
But I'm goin' to Mexico.

457
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,065
I'm goin'.

458
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:29,438
Louise?

459
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:32,108
Is that the way you answer the phone?

460
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,943
I was afraid I missed you.

461
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,904
I... I... I got it.

462
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:39,156
I was afraid I couldn't get a check cashed
on Saturday.

463
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,449
Who did it?

464
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,327
A friend of mine who owns a club.
Doug Randall.

465
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:46,581
- You didn't tell him what for, did you?
- No, I didn't say what it was for.

466
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:49,166
- I told him I was buyin' a car.
- Good. That's real good.

467
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,335
Listen, where do I go?

468
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:53,629
It's a place called the Vagabond Motel.

469
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:58,217
It's at 1921 North East 23rd.

470
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,970
It's under Peaches.

471
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:03,764
What?

472
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,144
That's the code word.

473
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:09,937
I miss you, Peaches.

474
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:12,982
Thanks, Jimmy. I appreciate it.

475
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:28,873
Ma'am, you sure you wouldn't rather
have a large, economy size?

476
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:33,002
No, no, that's okay.

477
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:37,048
What are you lookin' at?

478
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:38,424
- Hey.
- Hey.

479
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:40,426
I want you to call Darryl.

480
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:41,928
Call him?

481
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:45,598
Tell him you're having a wonderful time
and you'll be home tomorrow night.

482
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:48,017
- Will I be?
- I don't know.

483
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:49,810
I won't.

484
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:53,940
The newspaper.

485
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:04,200
And Witherspoon had a great play.
Watch this right here.

486
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:09,705
This is Darryl.

487
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:13,250
I have a collect call from Thelma.
Will you accept?

488
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:14,961
Why, yes, I will, operator.

489
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,799
Thelma, where in the Sam Hill are you?

490
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:23,177
I'm with Louise.

491
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,097
We're...
We're in the mountains. We're fishin'.

492
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,766
Have you lost your mind? Is that it?

493
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:32,061
Now, I leave for work, and you
take complete leave of your senses?

494
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:35,439
Darryl, calm down, please.

495
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,775
Don't get so mad. I can explain, okay?

496
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:41,612
- See, Louise...
- Hold on! Hold on!

497
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:44,657
Oh, come on, Kurt, pick it.

498
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,909
- Kurt knocks the ball loose.
- Pick it!

499
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:48,411
- Chad Williams's got it.
- Shit! God!

500
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:51,539
We end up with the ball...

501
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:52,623
Christ.

502
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:56,335
We're just gonna stay there and,
you know, fish and hang out and stuff.

503
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:58,921
We'll just be gone one more day.
We'll be home tomorrow night.

504
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:01,340
No, you won't. You'll be back today.

505
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:04,969
You get your butt back here, Thelma, now.

506
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:06,220
Goddamn it!

507
00:39:07,555 --> 00:39:08,556
Darryl.

508
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:15,146
Darryl, you're my husband, not my father.

509
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:17,273
Oh, now, that does it.

510
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,608
That Louise is nothin'
but a bad influence.

511
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:22,778
If you're not back here by tonight...

512
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:26,657
Thelma,

513
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:31,203
well, then I just don't wanna say.

514
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:34,415
Darryl.

515
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:36,375
Thelma.

516
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,170
Go fuck yourself.

517
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,259
Oh, that's good. That's just sweet.

518
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:50,931
- Shit!
- Sorry.

519
00:39:51,015 --> 00:39:52,600
- Darling, you all right?
- Yeah.

520
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:55,061
- Are you okay? Did I cause that?
- No, I'm sorry.

521
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:56,979
No? You're okay?

522
00:39:57,063 --> 00:39:59,273
All right.
Is there something I can do for you?

523
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:00,816
No, it's okay.

524
00:40:05,154 --> 00:40:08,449
Crazy.

525
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:52,326
Excuse me, ma'am.

526
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,370
May I ask
which direction you're heading?

527
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:57,832
See, I'm trying to get back to school,
my ride fell through,

528
00:40:57,915 --> 00:41:00,334
and, well, I'm kind of stuck here
like stink on stink.

529
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,336
So I was thinkin' that...

530
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:05,673
if you're goin' my way
or if I'm going your way...

531
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:08,300
- I think we're going to Oklahoma City...
- Perfect.

532
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:09,510
But I'm not sure.

533
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:12,179
Yeah, well, I'd appreciate it much.

534
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:18,686
Well, see, it's really not up to me.
It's not my car...

535
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:20,354
We'd have to ask my friend.

536
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:24,733
But I... She would probably say no.
She's a little bit uptight.

537
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:26,819
Maybe it's not such a good idea.

538
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:29,363
But I tell you what.
I thank you for your time.

539
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:32,283
But, I mean, I can ask, you know.
It wouldn't hurt nothing.

540
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,702
Well, no, it wouldn't hurt.

541
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,745
Hey.

542
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:40,291
Louise. Hey, Louise.

543
00:41:40,374 --> 00:41:42,668
This young man here
is on his way back to school,

544
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:45,337
and I thought since
we're going the same direction,

545
00:41:45,421 --> 00:41:47,798
you know, we could give him a ride, huh?

546
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:53,304
It's probably not a good idea.

547
00:41:55,306 --> 00:41:56,724
- Louise.
- No, probably not.

548
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:57,933
But I appreciate your time.

549
00:41:58,017 --> 00:42:00,477
You all have a good day, all right?
Drive safe.

550
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:01,896
Louise?

551
00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:10,613
Did you see how polite he is?
He was real sweet.

552
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:12,364
- Thelma.
- What?

553
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:16,785
Hey, cheer up, now. All right?

554
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:28,547
Fill her up.

555
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:31,383
Sure wish we could have
brought him with us.

556
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:34,428
What'd Darryl have to say?

557
00:42:35,638 --> 00:42:39,892
Oh, he said, okay, Thelma, I just wanted
to make sure you was all right.

558
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:41,810
I sure hope you're havin' fun.
You deserve it.

559
00:42:41,894 --> 00:42:43,938
After all, you put up with me.

560
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:45,314
I love you, honey.

561
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:54,949
So, how long
before we're in goddamn Mexico?

562
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:19,014
I just didn't think it would hurt
to give somebody a ride.

563
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,225
Did you see his butt?

564
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:24,687
Darryl don't have a cute butt.

565
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,897
You could park a car
in the shadow of his ass.

566
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:31,026
I'm sorry. I'm just not
in the mood for company right now.

567
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:36,365
Here. Take this map.

568
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:40,703
I need you to find all the secondary roads
to Mexico from Oklahoma City.

569
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:43,289
I think we should stay off the interstate.
We're too conspicuous.

570
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:49,128
Looks like we could get
on this Road 81 here

571
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:50,671
and head down towards Dallas.

572
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:52,047
I don't want to go through Texas.

573
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:53,966
Find some way we don't have to
go through there.

574
00:43:56,677 --> 00:43:59,263
Wait. What?

575
00:44:00,264 --> 00:44:04,601
You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma,
but you don't wanna go through Texas?

576
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:08,772
Thelma, you know how I feel about Texas!
We're not goin' that way!

577
00:44:08,856 --> 00:44:11,650
Yeah, I know, Louise,
but we're running for our lives.

578
00:44:11,734 --> 00:44:13,485
I mean, can't you make an exception?

579
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:15,654
I mean, look at this map!

580
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:19,742
The only thing between
Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas. Look!

581
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:21,577
Thelma, I'm not gonna talk about this!

582
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,997
Now, you either find another way
or give me the goddamn map and I will!

583
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,334
- You understand?
- No, Louise, I don't.

584
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:31,086
Now, how come you never told me
what happened to you there?

585
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:40,679
Look, you shoot off a guy's head
with his pants down,

586
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:43,349
believe me, Texas is not the place
you wanna get caught.

587
00:44:44,016 --> 00:44:45,184
Now, trust me.

588
00:44:45,893 --> 00:44:48,479
I told you,
I'm not gonna talk about this anymore.

589
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:28,352
Happy birthday, lady.

590
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:33,357
<i>You coulda been a cool crook</i>

591
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,193
<i>And, baby, you're so smart</i>

592
00:45:37,403 --> 00:45:40,739
<i>You know you could have been
a schoolbook</i>

593
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:45,828
<i>Well, you could have been anything
that you wanted to</i>

594
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:50,541
<i>And I can tell
the way you do the things you do</i>

595
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:54,420
<i>The way you do the things you do</i>

596
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:14,148
Is the manager in?

597
00:46:14,231 --> 00:46:16,692
Marian, there's a police officer here.

598
00:46:39,465 --> 00:46:41,633
All right. All right, Thelma. All right.

599
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:44,052
Okay.

600
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:18,670
The other night there was a murder
out at the Silver Bullet.

601
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:20,672
A man was shot.

602
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:27,137
And we have some witnesses
that saw a 1966 T-Bird convertible

603
00:47:27,221 --> 00:47:29,097
leaving the scene,

604
00:47:29,181 --> 00:47:31,683
sort of speeding
out of the driveway there.

605
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:35,229
And that vehicle is registered
to one Louise Sawyer.

606
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:41,568
And we have reason to believe your wife
was the other occupant of that car.

607
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:44,988
What?

608
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:49,743
What?

609
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:51,119
What?

610
00:47:51,954 --> 00:47:53,664
Excuse me.

611
00:47:53,747 --> 00:47:55,249
You're standing in your pizza.

612
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:58,377
Oh, shit!

613
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:01,797
So tell me something, Miss Thelma.
How is it you ain't got any kids?

614
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,092
I mean, God gives you somethin' special,
I think you ought to pass it on.

615
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:09,555
- Well, Darryl... That's my husband.
- Darryl?

616
00:48:09,638 --> 00:48:11,765
Yeah. He says he's not ready yet.

617
00:48:11,848 --> 00:48:14,268
Says he's still too much of a kid himself.

618
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:16,395
Kind of prides himself on being infantile.

619
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:17,980
He's got a lot to be proud of.

620
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:21,066
- Louise and him don't get along.
- That's putting it mildly.

621
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:23,777
- She thinks he's a pig.
- I know he's a pig.

622
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,239
Did you get married real young,
Miss Thelma?

623
00:48:28,282 --> 00:48:31,368
Well, I guess 18 is kind of young.

624
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:36,957
But we'd already been going out four years
when we got married.

625
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,334
- How long?
- Four years.

626
00:48:39,418 --> 00:48:41,503
I never been with anybody but Darryl.

627
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,006
Oh, I'm sorry.

628
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:48,719
Well, if you don't mind me saying so,
he sounds like a real asshole.

629
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:54,016
It's okay. He is an asshole.

630
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:56,101
Most of the time, I just let it slide.

631
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:01,648
You better slow down there, Miss Louise.
That's a cop up ahead.

632
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:03,483
- Shit.
- Yep.

633
00:49:39,728 --> 00:49:42,147
Maybe you got
a few too many parking tickets?

634
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:45,984
We'll take you to Oklahoma City.
Then you best be on your way, all right?

635
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:47,069
All right.

636
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,205
Prints on the trunk of the car
match those of Thelma Dickinson.

637
00:49:58,288 --> 00:50:00,624
Well, I'll be damned.
Isn't that strange?

638
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:02,876
And the husband says a gun is missing.

639
00:50:03,794 --> 00:50:05,295
She took a lot of stuff.

640
00:50:06,296 --> 00:50:09,466
It looks like she maybe planned
on being gone a while.

641
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:14,638
The strange thing is, her husband said
she would never touch that gun.

642
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:18,475
He got it for her
'cause he's out late a lot,

643
00:50:19,476 --> 00:50:22,813
but he said she'd never touch it,
wouldn't learn to shoot it.

644
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:24,815
Just kept it in a drawer for years.

645
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:27,317
- What kind of gun was it?
- .38.

646
00:50:27,401 --> 00:50:29,027
Right. Where are they?

647
00:50:29,111 --> 00:50:33,115
They were on their way to some guy's cabin
and they never showed up.

648
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:37,994
All right.

649
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:41,248
Now, I'm gonna go and... Listen up.
I'm gonna go in. It's gonna take a minute.

650
00:50:41,331 --> 00:50:43,166
You two better say your goodbyes,
you understand?

651
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,459
All right.

652
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:45,544
Okay.

653
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:51,633
- Hi.
- Hi.

654
00:50:51,717 --> 00:50:54,928
I'm here to pick up a money order
for Louise Sawyer.

655
00:50:58,014 --> 00:50:59,224
There's nothing.

656
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:03,854
How about Peaches?
Could you try code word Peaches?

657
00:51:03,937 --> 00:51:06,022
Did I hear somebody say Peaches?

658
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:08,775
Oh, my God. Jimmy.

659
00:51:08,859 --> 00:51:10,569
That's the secret word.

660
00:51:11,862 --> 00:51:13,530
Show the lady what she's won, Don.

661
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:19,369
- What are you doin' here?
- I just came to see you, baby.

662
00:51:22,372 --> 00:51:25,584
Can I have another room, please?
Put it on my credit card.

663
00:51:34,676 --> 00:51:37,304
Thelma. Get your foot down.

664
00:51:37,387 --> 00:51:39,181
Look who's here.

665
00:51:39,264 --> 00:51:42,934
Oh, shit! Jimmy. Hi, stranger.

666
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:44,561
What in the world are you doin' here?

667
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:47,647
Ask me no questions
and I'll tell you no lies.

668
00:51:47,731 --> 00:51:50,066
Good answer.
Same goes double for me.

669
00:51:50,901 --> 00:51:52,194
Who's the cowboy?

670
00:51:52,277 --> 00:51:54,529
- Oh, this here... this is J.D.
- How do?

671
00:51:54,613 --> 00:51:56,072
- He's a student.
- He's gone.

672
00:51:56,156 --> 00:51:59,367
We're just giving him a ride to here,
then he... he...

673
00:51:59,451 --> 00:52:01,912
- Louise said that he would have to go, so...
- He's gone.

674
00:52:01,995 --> 00:52:04,539
- I guess that's what he's doing.
- Yeah, I reckon that's what I'm doing.

675
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:06,291
- He's gone.
- Like the wind.

676
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:07,584
- Have a good trip.
- Okay.

677
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:08,668
Thank you.

678
00:52:08,752 --> 00:52:11,296
Nice to meet you.

679
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,841
Yep. Yep, that's him goin'.

680
00:52:14,925 --> 00:52:16,426
I love to watch him go.

681
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,386
Thelma kind of took to him.

682
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,889
Yeah, well,
I got you a room there, Thelma.

683
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:23,767
You can go on in and take yourself
a nice, cold shower.

684
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:26,812
Well, you know me, Jimmy.
I'm just a wild woman.

685
00:52:39,074 --> 00:52:40,909
It's our future.

686
00:52:50,627 --> 00:52:51,837
What are you gonna tell him?

687
00:52:53,672 --> 00:52:54,714
Nothin'.

688
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:57,300
I'm not gonna tell him a thing.

689
00:52:58,426 --> 00:53:01,721
Least I can do is not make him any more
of an accessory than he already is.

690
00:53:02,389 --> 00:53:05,559
You are so sweet to that guy.
You know, you really are.

691
00:53:05,642 --> 00:53:07,644
Imagine not wantin' to drag him into this.

692
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:09,729
I didn't ask him to come.

693
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:13,650
He's no different than any other guy.
He just loves the chase, is all.

694
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:17,237
Well, he sure got his work
cut out for him now, don't he?

695
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,030
Thelma, just put a lid on it!

696
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:22,868
Now...

697
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:27,289
I want you to just...
You guard that money.

698
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:29,207
Okay.

699
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:33,545
And if there's any problem,
then you call me in Room 211.

700
00:53:35,171 --> 00:53:36,339
Okay.

701
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:38,550
I won't wait up.

702
00:53:57,027 --> 00:53:58,570
- You want a drink?
- No.

703
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,282
Why don't you tell me what's going on?

704
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,078
I'm not gonna tell you what's goin' on.

705
00:54:07,162 --> 00:54:09,122
Someday soon
you'll understand why I can't,

706
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:11,750
but I'm not goin' to,
so don't ask me.

707
00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:17,923
- Can I ask you one thing?
- Maybe.

708
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:21,343
You in love with somebody else?

709
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:23,386
Does this have somethin' to do
with another man?

710
00:54:24,304 --> 00:54:26,306
No, it's not anything like that.

711
00:54:28,016 --> 00:54:31,144
Well, then what is it, goddamn it?

712
00:54:32,145 --> 00:54:34,022
Are you just gonna leave for fucking ever?

713
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:38,151
What, did you fuckin' kill somebody?

714
00:54:38,234 --> 00:54:40,153
You start this shit, I'm out of here.

715
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:46,034
I'm sorry.

716
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:50,497
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

717
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,625
You wanna come back
over there and sit down?

718
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,627
I wanna give you somethin'.

719
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,087
I'm fine right here.

720
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:59,589
- I wanna give you somethin'.
- Give it to me here.

721
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:06,304
Here.

722
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:19,526
Why don't you try it on?

723
00:55:21,277 --> 00:55:24,406
Well, you didn't see
that one comin', did you?

724
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:27,617
Why, Jimmy?

725
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:31,496
Why now?

726
00:55:33,373 --> 00:55:35,583
Try not to get too excited, Louise.

727
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:40,672
I just flew across two states
with that ring in my fuckin' hand and...

728
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:44,718
You know I hate to fly.

729
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:49,431
You came all this way
because you thought...

730
00:55:49,514 --> 00:55:51,641
you thought I was with somebody else.

731
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:56,021
No, that's not why I came.

732
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:03,403
Because, you know, I...
I don't want to lose you.

733
00:56:03,486 --> 00:56:07,073
And I get the feeling like
you're gonna, like, split permanently.

734
00:56:07,157 --> 00:56:09,034
That's not a good reason to get married.

735
00:56:11,453 --> 00:56:13,038
Well, I thought that's what you wanted.

736
00:56:14,706 --> 00:56:15,915
I did.

737
00:56:17,584 --> 00:56:19,169
But not like this.

738
00:56:19,252 --> 00:56:21,921
Cooking methods.
Questions are encouraged.

739
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:23,923
The Fort Reno Days Festival highlights...

740
00:56:24,007 --> 00:56:27,177
settler, Indian and military
lifestyles of years past.

741
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,346
And the military contingent boasts
an actual member of the 5th Cavalry.

742
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,016
- Louise?
- No, Thelma, it's me.

743
00:56:34,476 --> 00:56:36,144
Surprise.

744
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:40,148
I was just out there
and I was thinkin' that...

745
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:42,692
Well, I know I'm supposed to be gone
and all, but...

746
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:44,986
You know.

747
00:56:48,782 --> 00:56:51,743
And I'm not havin' a turd's luck
getting a ride out in this rain.

748
00:56:53,203 --> 00:56:55,038
I was just thinkin' about you.

749
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,753
This... This is crazy.
This... I'm...

750
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:04,547
I'm gonna get out of your hair.
All right? I'm gonna...

751
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:07,592
Well, wait, wait.

752
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,969
Where you goin'?

753
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:16,684
I don't know. You know. Nowhere.

754
00:57:16,768 --> 00:57:20,480
You think I'm happy playin'
my one-night gigs in Ramada Inn lounges?

755
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:22,982
You think you're the only one
with dreams that didn't work out?

756
00:57:23,066 --> 00:57:25,026
We both got what we settled for.

757
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:27,779
I think maybe
you just don't love me anymore.

758
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:29,739
No, I do love you.

759
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:36,579
But I think it's time to just...

760
00:57:39,082 --> 00:57:41,042
let go of the old mistakes.

761
00:57:43,253 --> 00:57:45,004
Just chalk it up to...

762
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:48,758
bad timin'.

763
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:52,720
I think it's time to let go.

764
00:57:54,931 --> 00:57:56,933
- Look out. Look out.
- Don't... Don't do it.

765
00:57:59,016 --> 00:58:00,603
Come on.

766
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:02,480
- What are you doing?
- You're too... Come on. Here.

767
00:58:02,564 --> 00:58:04,816
- All right, all right. I'll do it.
- Your turn.

768
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:06,359
- Oh, shit. Here we go.
- Come on.

769
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,612
- Well, don't just leave 'em there.
- Come on.

770
00:58:09,696 --> 00:58:10,780
All right.

771
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:14,409
God. What are you...

772
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:20,165
You see, this is an unfair advantage.
You got too much metal goin' here.

773
00:58:20,248 --> 00:58:23,543
You wanna lighten the load a little bit?
Yeah?

774
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,046
Yeah.

775
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:28,923
I think that's better.
What do you think?

776
00:58:29,883 --> 00:58:31,551
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

777
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:36,139
- Take me, break me, make me a man!
- You're gonna hit your head!

778
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:39,184
- Watch your head! Careful.
- Oh, my head's fine.

779
00:58:39,267 --> 00:58:41,269
Who are you anyway?

780
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:46,316
I'm the great and powerful Oz.
Who do you want to be?

781
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,819
Come on, tell me.
I know you're not just some schoolboy.

782
00:58:49,903 --> 00:58:53,198
- Nobody ever tells me shit. Tell me.
- Oh, I'm just some guy.

783
00:58:53,281 --> 00:58:57,577
A guy whose parole officer is probably
havin' a shit fit right about now.

784
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,537
What do you mean, parole officer?

785
00:59:00,622 --> 00:59:02,248
Wh... Are you a criminal?

786
00:59:02,332 --> 00:59:04,584
No. No, not no more, Thelma.

787
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,753
Let's see.

788
00:59:06,836 --> 00:59:09,088
Besides bustin' parole,
I haven't done one wrong thing.

789
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:12,926
- What did you do?
- I'm a robber.

790
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:19,224
- You're a bank robber?
- No. No. I don't rob no banks. Come on.

791
00:59:19,307 --> 00:59:20,600
What did you rob?

792
00:59:21,976 --> 00:59:25,104
Well, let's see.

793
00:59:25,939 --> 00:59:27,023
Let's add it up here.

794
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:30,693
I robbed a gas station,

795
00:59:30,777 --> 00:59:34,322
a couple of convenience stores,
liquor stores.

796
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:37,283
Oh, my God.

797
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:39,953
How?

798
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:44,916
- Come on.
- Okay.

799
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:47,293
First you pick your place, all right?

800
00:59:47,377 --> 00:59:49,671
Then I just sit back
and watch it for a little while,

801
00:59:49,754 --> 00:59:52,340
wait for that right moment
to make my move, see?

802
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:55,677
That's somethin' you gotta know up here.
That shit cannot be taught.

803
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,637
Yeah, then...

804
00:59:58,638 --> 01:00:01,975
- Oh, shit, I don't wanna talk about this.
- Come on. I do.

805
01:00:03,893 --> 01:00:05,019
All right.

806
01:00:05,728 --> 01:00:10,942
Then I'd waltz right in. Yeah.

807
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:14,946
And I'd just kind of waltz on in
and I'd say, ladies, gentlemen,

808
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:16,990
let's see who wins a prize
for keepin' their cool.

809
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:19,659
Simon says,
everybody down on the floor.

810
01:00:19,742 --> 01:00:22,662
Now, nobody loses their head,
then nobody loses their head.

811
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:26,332
You, sir. Yeah, you do the honors.

812
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:28,418
Take that cash,
you put it in that bag right there,

813
01:00:28,501 --> 01:00:30,461
you got an amazing story
to tell your friends.

814
01:00:30,545 --> 01:00:33,548
If not, well, you got a tag on your toe.
You decide.

815
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:36,134
Simple as that.

816
01:00:37,427 --> 01:00:39,178
Then I just slip on out

817
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:44,058
and get the hell out of Dodge, yeah.

818
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,353
My goodness.

819
01:00:47,437 --> 01:00:49,814
You were sure gentlemanly about it.

820
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:52,734
Well, now, I've always believed that,
done properly,

821
01:00:52,817 --> 01:00:56,029
armed robbery doesn't have to be
a totally unpleasant experience.

822
01:00:57,655 --> 01:00:59,198
What?

823
01:00:59,282 --> 01:01:01,659
You're a real live outlaw, aren't you?

824
01:01:01,743 --> 01:01:06,205
Well, I may be an outlaw, darlin',
but you're the one stealin' my heart.

825
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,001
- Oh, smooth.
- Oh, yeah.

826
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:12,086
- Isn't he? Isn't he?
- Oh, you're smooth.

827
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:15,214
- That's right.
- Yeah. How did you get that way?

828
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:17,216
All for you.

829
01:01:22,013 --> 01:01:24,182
Remember when we first met?

830
01:01:26,351 --> 01:01:27,560
Yeah.

831
01:01:28,936 --> 01:01:30,980
What happened? Tell me what you said.

832
01:01:31,064 --> 01:01:33,066
I said you had a nice pair of eyes.

833
01:01:35,777 --> 01:01:38,446
And what'd I say? You remember?

834
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:45,870
Yeah, you shut 'em.
Asked me if I knew what color they were.

835
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:49,665
And what did you say?

836
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:52,585
I didn't know.

837
01:01:57,715 --> 01:01:59,509
Jimmy, what color are my eyes?

838
01:02:02,678 --> 01:02:04,639
They're brown.

839
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:48,850
Wait. Wait.

840
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:19,941
Y'all want some more coffee?

841
01:04:21,442 --> 01:04:22,443
Thank you.

842
01:04:25,363 --> 01:04:28,157
Anything else?

843
01:04:31,994 --> 01:04:33,746
Look, I don't know
what's goin' on with you,

844
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:37,291
or what happened
or what y'all did, but...

845
01:04:39,043 --> 01:04:43,422
I'm not gonna tell anybody anything,
and I'm not gonna say that I even saw you.

846
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:47,969
Okay?

847
01:04:48,052 --> 01:04:50,263
Damn, Jimmy, what did you do,
take some kind of pill,

848
01:04:50,346 --> 01:04:52,223
makes you say all the right stuff?

849
01:04:55,268 --> 01:04:58,145
Yeah, I'm chokin' on it.

850
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:04,193
You sure you don't want me
to go with you?

851
01:05:06,237 --> 01:05:09,073
I think it's probably not
a real good idea right now.

852
01:05:10,032 --> 01:05:14,954
But I'll catch up with you later
on down the road.

853
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:18,416
Yeah.

854
01:05:22,837 --> 01:05:26,757
Well, my taxi is here.

855
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:34,181
So why don't you just keep that?

856
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:38,227
- Okay?
- Thanks.

857
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:42,523
I just want you to be happy.

858
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:46,819
I am happy, sweetie.
Happy as I can be.

859
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:51,073
All right.

860
01:05:51,157 --> 01:05:53,534
All right.

861
01:05:54,577 --> 01:05:57,622
Well, why don't you give ol' Jimmy
a kiss goodbye?

862
01:05:58,414 --> 01:06:01,125
And I'll be gettin' out of here.

863
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:07,757
Come here, ol' Jimmy.

864
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:44,210
I'll be seeing you, Louise.

865
01:06:49,757 --> 01:06:51,425
You have a safe trip.

866
01:07:06,023 --> 01:07:08,317
It's a good thing he left when he did.

867
01:07:08,401 --> 01:07:12,321
We thought we were gonna have to
put out a fire.

868
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:25,459
Hi.

869
01:07:25,543 --> 01:07:29,714
- What happened to your hair?
- Nothin'. Got messed up.

870
01:07:31,507 --> 01:07:32,925
Thelma, what's wrong with you?

871
01:07:34,093 --> 01:07:37,763
Nothin'.
Why? Do I seem different?

872
01:07:39,432 --> 01:07:41,142
Well, now that you mention it, yeah.

873
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:44,270
You seem like you're crazy
or you're on drugs.

874
01:07:45,813 --> 01:07:49,900
Well, I'm not on drugs,
but I might be crazy!

875
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:56,907
Thelma, what happened?

876
01:08:00,244 --> 01:08:02,079
- What happened?
- J.D. came back.

877
01:08:02,163 --> 01:08:03,998
- Oh, my God, Louise. Oh, my God.
- No.

878
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:05,499
- Oh, no!
- I can't believe it.

879
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:07,960
- I mean, I just can't believe it!
- No!

880
01:08:08,043 --> 01:08:11,839
Oh, my God, it's like...

881
01:08:11,922 --> 01:08:14,008
I finally understand
what all the fuss is about!

882
01:08:14,091 --> 01:08:16,927
Now it's just like
a whole nother ball game.

883
01:08:17,011 --> 01:08:20,806
Oh, darlin', I'm so happy for you.
That's great. I really am.

884
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:23,184
You finally got laid properly.

885
01:08:23,267 --> 01:08:25,186
That's so sweet.

886
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:29,482
- Where is he now?
- He's takin' a shower.

887
01:08:31,776 --> 01:08:33,277
Thelma, you left him alone in the room?

888
01:08:36,864 --> 01:08:39,992
Where's the money?
Oh, my God. Thelma, where's the money?

889
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:42,286
It's on the bed table.

890
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:43,662
It's okay.

891
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:48,834
It's on the nightstand!
It's okay.

892
01:08:54,757 --> 01:08:57,384
Oh, goddamn it!

893
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,721
I've never been lucky! Not one time!

894
01:09:02,848 --> 01:09:06,227
Shit! That son of a bitch burned me.

895
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:09,730
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

896
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:14,777
Louise.

897
01:09:16,445 --> 01:09:17,655
You okay?

898
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:21,951
Louise.

899
01:09:23,035 --> 01:09:26,539
I'm sorry. I mean it.

900
01:09:32,962 --> 01:09:35,256
Louise, it's okay.

901
01:09:37,258 --> 01:09:40,970
- It's okay.
- No, Thelma, it's not okay.

902
01:09:41,053 --> 01:09:42,930
It's definitely not okay.

903
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:48,060
None of this is okay.

904
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:52,731
I mean, what are we gonna do
for money, huh?

905
01:09:52,815 --> 01:09:54,984
How we gonna get gas?

906
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:58,696
I mean, tradin' on our good looks?

907
01:09:58,779 --> 01:10:00,072
I mean...

908
01:10:00,823 --> 01:10:04,118
Oh, goddamn it, Thelma,
it's not okay.

909
01:10:08,873 --> 01:10:12,543
Louise.
Hey, now you listen to me.

910
01:10:14,003 --> 01:10:17,756
Don't you worry about it.
You hear me?

911
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,800
Come on. Stand up!

912
01:10:21,969 --> 01:10:26,348
Louise, just don't you worry about it.
You hear?

913
01:10:26,432 --> 01:10:27,850
Come on.

914
01:10:30,603 --> 01:10:32,187
Come on, damn it!

915
01:10:32,271 --> 01:10:34,356
Get your stuff and let's get out of here.

916
01:10:35,983 --> 01:10:37,234
Move!

917
01:10:37,318 --> 01:10:39,987
Jesus Christ, come on. Come on.

918
01:10:41,697 --> 01:10:45,743
Oh, take your damn time.
Come on. Here we go.

919
01:11:06,889 --> 01:11:09,183
Damn, damn.

920
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:16,440
Afraid of a little rain, Max?

921
01:11:21,028 --> 01:11:23,530
Well, come on in.
Wipe your feet.

922
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:41,215
As you know, we've tapped your phone
in the event that she calls in.

923
01:11:41,924 --> 01:11:44,426
Wh... Is that gonna cost me?

924
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:45,844
Excuse me. May I?

925
01:11:45,928 --> 01:11:49,056
Hey, live it up.
That's what it's there for.

926
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:52,518
We're going to have someone here
at the house on the phones

927
01:11:52,601 --> 01:11:53,602
until we find them.

928
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:57,398
The important thing is not to let on
that you know anything.

929
01:11:57,982 --> 01:12:00,401
We want to find out where they are.

930
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:02,361
I don't want to get too personal,

931
01:12:03,612 --> 01:12:06,198
but do you have a good relationship
with your wife?

932
01:12:06,281 --> 01:12:09,451
I... I love Thelma.

933
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:15,040
I don't intend anything by that, sir.
It's just a question I have to ask.

934
01:12:15,124 --> 01:12:18,961
- Are you close with her?
- Yeah. I guess.

935
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:23,549
I mean, I'm about as close as I can be
to a nutcase like that.

936
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:32,141
Yeah, well, if she calls,
just be gentle.

937
01:12:33,267 --> 01:12:36,645
You know, like you're really happy
to hear from her.

938
01:12:36,729 --> 01:12:38,772
Like you really miss her.

939
01:12:38,856 --> 01:12:40,858
Women love that shit.

940
01:12:42,151 --> 01:12:45,904
Okay. If you say so.

941
01:12:49,742 --> 01:12:50,868
Women love that shit.

942
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:52,578
I'm sorry. It's just...

943
01:13:06,717 --> 01:13:08,844
Oh, cool. Can I wear these?

944
01:13:16,435 --> 01:13:17,561
Want anything?

945
01:14:18,497 --> 01:14:22,292
Drive, Louise! Drive! Drive the car!

946
01:14:27,589 --> 01:14:29,925
Go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

947
01:14:33,095 --> 01:14:34,596
What happened?

948
01:14:35,931 --> 01:14:37,182
You robbed the store?

949
01:14:37,266 --> 01:14:39,518
You robbed the goddamn store?

950
01:14:39,601 --> 01:14:41,770
Well, we needed the money.

951
01:14:41,854 --> 01:14:43,772
It's not like I killed anybody,
for God's sake.

952
01:14:43,856 --> 01:14:45,399
- Thelma!
- I'm sorry.

953
01:14:45,482 --> 01:14:47,109
We needed the money.
Now we have it.

954
01:14:47,192 --> 01:14:50,320
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, shit, Thelma!

955
01:14:50,404 --> 01:14:51,822
- Louise. Louise.
- Oh, shit!

956
01:14:51,905 --> 01:14:53,198
- Come on, get a grip.
- Shit!

957
01:14:53,282 --> 01:14:56,326
- Drive us to goddamn Mexico, will you?
- Okay.

958
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:59,288
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

959
01:14:59,371 --> 01:15:03,041
Well, how... how'd you...
I mean, what did you say?

960
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:06,545
Well, I...
I just waltzed on in there and I said...

961
01:15:06,628 --> 01:15:09,006
Good mornin', ladies and gentlemen.
This is a robbery.

962
01:15:09,089 --> 01:15:11,675
Now, if nobody loses their head,
nobody will lose their head.

963
01:15:11,758 --> 01:15:14,678
Simon says, y'all lie down on the floor,
please. Right away.

964
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:16,847
You too.
Ma'am, would you get down?

965
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:17,931
Not you, sir.

966
01:15:18,015 --> 01:15:20,350
Let's see who will win a prize
for keepin' their cool.

967
01:15:20,434 --> 01:15:21,643
Sir, would you do the honors?

968
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:24,396
- Take all the cash, put it in a paper bag.
- Yes, ma'am.

969
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:26,899
You're gonna have
an amazing story to tell your friends.

970
01:15:26,982 --> 01:15:29,401
If not, you'll have a tag on your toe.
You decide.

971
01:15:30,611 --> 01:15:32,613
Hurry up. Let's go.

972
01:15:33,822 --> 01:15:35,532
Ma'am, would you be quiet?
Sir, get down, please.

973
01:15:35,616 --> 01:15:39,244
Thank you. Just stay there.
Just get real comfortable.

974
01:15:40,954 --> 01:15:43,999
Hey, throw in some bottles
of Wild Turkey too, will you?

975
01:15:44,082 --> 01:15:45,083
Yes, ma'am.

976
01:15:47,085 --> 01:15:49,338
- Now, you get down too.
- Yes, ma'am.

977
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:50,964
Ladies and gentlemen,

978
01:15:51,048 --> 01:15:52,799
I want to thank you all
for your cooperation.

979
01:15:52,883 --> 01:15:56,094
Now, stay down on the floor till I'm gone.
Have a good day.

980
01:15:59,181 --> 01:16:00,390
Jesus Christ!

981
01:16:00,474 --> 01:16:02,184
Good God.

982
01:16:02,267 --> 01:16:03,435
My Lord.

983
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:16,657
Hey, Louise, better slow down.

984
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:19,618
I'd just die if we get caught
over a speeding ticket.

985
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:22,621
You know, for the first time in my life,
I wish this car wasn't green.

986
01:16:24,957 --> 01:16:27,584
You sure we should be drivin' like this
in broad daylight?

987
01:16:27,668 --> 01:16:30,087
No, we shouldn't,
but I want to put some distance between us

988
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:32,422
and the scene of our last goddamn crime!

989
01:16:35,817 --> 01:16:39,930
Oh, man!
You wouldn't have believed it.

990
01:16:40,013 --> 01:16:43,558
It was like I'd been doin' it all my life.
I mean, nobody would believe it.

991
01:16:45,143 --> 01:16:48,897
- Think you found your callin'?
- Maybe. Maybe.

992
01:16:48,981 --> 01:16:51,859
The call of the wild!

993
01:16:52,943 --> 01:16:55,654
You are disturbed!

994
01:16:55,737 --> 01:16:59,032
Yeah, I believe I am.

995
01:17:12,546 --> 01:17:14,798
Thelma, don't you litter.

996
01:17:17,301 --> 01:17:19,136
Wait a minute. Oh, shoot.

997
01:17:19,219 --> 01:17:21,680
God, I hate when y... This always happens
when you're in a hurry.

998
01:17:23,807 --> 01:17:26,351
Damn. What are you gonna do?
Just stay drunk all day?

999
01:17:28,312 --> 01:17:29,938
Try to.

1000
01:17:34,776 --> 01:17:36,695
Oh, isn't that nice?

1001
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:39,614
Truck drivers are always so nice.
Best drivers on the road.

1002
01:17:44,244 --> 01:17:47,706
Oh, Lord. How original.

1003
01:17:57,007 --> 01:17:58,717
Thank you.

1004
01:18:00,344 --> 01:18:02,346
Ew, man. That's disgustin'!

1005
01:18:02,429 --> 01:18:04,473
He's a pig! He's a fucking pig!

1006
01:18:04,556 --> 01:18:05,390
That's gross!

1007
01:18:05,474 --> 01:18:08,685
- What's he gotta do that for anyway?
- I don't know.

1008
01:18:08,769 --> 01:18:10,562
They think we like it.

1009
01:18:10,645 --> 01:18:13,148
They think it turns us on or something.

1010
01:18:13,231 --> 01:18:14,316
Shut up!

1011
01:18:52,187 --> 01:18:53,522
James Lennox?

1012
01:18:54,439 --> 01:18:57,067
- Yeah. Who wants to know?
- Arkansas State Police.

1013
01:19:32,394 --> 01:19:33,395
Hi.

1014
01:20:13,101 --> 01:20:14,394
Thelma.

1015
01:20:17,731 --> 01:20:20,066
- What?
- I want you to call Darryl.

1016
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:22,861
What for?

1017
01:20:26,781 --> 01:20:28,116
I want you to find...

1018
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,868
I want you to find out
if he knows anything.

1019
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:32,787
If you think he does,
you gotta hang up the phone.

1020
01:20:32,871 --> 01:20:36,625
That means the police have told him,
and the phone's probably tapped.

1021
01:20:36,708 --> 01:20:40,003
Tapped the phone?
What are you talkin' about?

1022
01:20:40,086 --> 01:20:43,131
Come on, Thelma.
Murder one and armed robbery?

1023
01:20:43,215 --> 01:20:44,257
Murder one?

1024
01:20:44,341 --> 01:20:46,176
- We can't even say it was self-defense?
- It wasn't.

1025
01:20:46,259 --> 01:20:49,304
- We were walkin' away. We got away.
- Yeah, but they don't know that.

1026
01:20:49,387 --> 01:20:50,805
It was just you and me there.

1027
01:20:50,889 --> 01:20:52,641
I'll say he raped me
and you had to shoot him.

1028
01:20:52,724 --> 01:20:54,309
That's almost the truth.

1029
01:20:54,392 --> 01:20:56,686
- It won't work.
- Why not?

1030
01:20:56,770 --> 01:20:59,648
Because there's no physical evidence.
Can't prove he did it.

1031
01:20:59,731 --> 01:21:02,817
We can't even probably prove by now
that he touched you.

1032
01:21:04,277 --> 01:21:05,403
God.

1033
01:21:06,321 --> 01:21:08,448
The law is some tricky shit, isn't it?

1034
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:14,788
Hey, how do you know
about all this stuff anyway?

1035
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:17,666
Besides, what are we gonna say about
the robbery? There's no excuse for that.

1036
01:21:17,749 --> 01:21:20,085
There's no such thing
as justifiable robbery.

1037
01:21:20,168 --> 01:21:22,379
All right, Louise, will ya!

1038
01:21:22,462 --> 01:21:23,672
Where'd you get this?

1039
01:21:24,548 --> 01:21:25,549
Stole it.

1040
01:21:38,061 --> 01:21:39,104
Hi.

1041
01:21:39,854 --> 01:21:42,732
Hi!

1042
01:21:44,651 --> 01:21:45,944
Who's the nut?

1043
01:21:46,653 --> 01:21:49,197
- That's Mrs. Dickinson's husband.
- Excuse me.

1044
01:21:49,281 --> 01:21:51,658
Well, shit twice and fall back in it.

1045
01:21:52,534 --> 01:21:53,618
God.

1046
01:21:55,537 --> 01:21:58,623
Where'd you get the $6,600 in cash?

1047
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:02,127
A friend.

1048
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:03,795
We spoke with a gentleman today

1049
01:22:03,878 --> 01:22:07,507
who says he delivered very close to
that same amount to a Ms. Louise Sawyer.

1050
01:22:07,591 --> 01:22:09,384
Do you know her too?

1051
01:22:09,467 --> 01:22:11,553
Yes, sir.

1052
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:14,639
Yeah, I believe
she's the woman drivin' the car.

1053
01:22:15,724 --> 01:22:19,019
He said he took it to a motel
in Oklahoma City.

1054
01:22:19,102 --> 01:22:21,396
He also says that, at that time,
he met a man.

1055
01:22:22,314 --> 01:22:25,567
He identified you
through a series of mug shots.

1056
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:28,778
He also told us
that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed close.

1057
01:22:29,654 --> 01:22:30,655
Is that true?

1058
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:33,199
Well, sir,

1059
01:22:34,075 --> 01:22:37,120
you might say we had
a meetin' of the minds, yeah.

1060
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:40,790
Are you aware
that Mrs. Dickinson and Ms. Sawyer

1061
01:22:40,874 --> 01:22:42,626
are wanted in connection with a murder?

1062
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:45,545
Murder? What, Thelma? Well, damn!

1063
01:22:45,629 --> 01:22:48,548
Did they ever indicate that they might be
on the run from the law?

1064
01:22:49,424 --> 01:22:52,302
Well, you know, sir,
now that you mention it,

1065
01:22:52,385 --> 01:22:54,012
they might have seemed
a little bit jumpy.

1066
01:22:55,555 --> 01:22:58,141
- You know what?
- What?

1067
01:22:58,224 --> 01:22:59,934
You're starting to irritate me.

1068
01:23:00,018 --> 01:23:01,478
Yeah, me too.

1069
01:23:01,561 --> 01:23:03,188
Well, that'll happen.

1070
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:05,940
You two boys have a lot in common.

1071
01:23:06,024 --> 01:23:08,234
Maybe I should just step
out of the room for a sec.

1072
01:23:11,321 --> 01:23:12,739
I got a better idea.

1073
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:18,244
Do you mind if I speak to him alone
for a minute?

1074
01:23:36,554 --> 01:23:39,391
What? What'd I do?
Nothin', that's what.

1075
01:23:39,474 --> 01:23:41,935
Tell you somethin',
this is a crock of shit,

1076
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:43,812
Mr. John fucking Law.

1077
01:23:51,611 --> 01:23:53,738
Son, I got a feeling about something and...

1078
01:23:53,822 --> 01:23:56,408
- Yeah?
- I just wanna ask your opinion.

1079
01:23:58,993 --> 01:24:01,705
Do you think Thelma Dickinson
would have committed armed robbery

1080
01:24:01,788 --> 01:24:03,790
if you hadn't taken all their money?

1081
01:24:06,084 --> 01:24:07,752
Get your foot off that table.

1082
01:24:13,174 --> 01:24:14,551
Cat got your tongue?

1083
01:24:14,634 --> 01:24:16,636
No. No, I...

1084
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,305
Well, how you know I took it?
How you know they didn't...

1085
01:24:21,558 --> 01:24:23,518
Don't you fucking lie to me!

1086
01:24:24,686 --> 01:24:26,938
There's two girls out there
that had a chance.

1087
01:24:27,021 --> 01:24:28,690
They had a chance.

1088
01:24:28,773 --> 01:24:31,067
- And now you've screwed it up for them.
- No.

1089
01:24:31,151 --> 01:24:32,986
And now they're in some serious trouble.

1090
01:24:33,069 --> 01:24:35,238
And I'm gonna hold you
personally responsible

1091
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:37,449
for at least part of it
if anything happens to them.

1092
01:24:38,324 --> 01:24:40,160
I got no feelin' for you.

1093
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:43,288
Now, you're either gonna tell me
every damn thing you know,

1094
01:24:43,371 --> 01:24:46,291
so there's a small chance
that I can actually do them some good,

1095
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:49,210
or I'm gonna be all over you
like a fly on shit

1096
01:24:49,294 --> 01:24:51,045
for the rest of your natural life.

1097
01:24:51,129 --> 01:24:53,923
Your miseries
will be my goddamn mission in life.

1098
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:55,592
Yes, sir.

1099
01:24:58,136 --> 01:25:00,805
- Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. That's right.

1100
01:25:00,889 --> 01:25:02,515
- We understand each other?
- Yeah.

1101
01:25:02,599 --> 01:25:03,600
Okay.

1102
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:09,564
- Mr. Dickinson?
- Yeah?

1103
01:25:09,647 --> 01:25:11,941
If you'd just hang on,
I want a word with you.

1104
01:25:12,984 --> 01:25:14,360
I like your wife.

1105
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:18,907
- Hey, come back here!
- Hey, hey!

1106
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:21,493
Come back here, you little shit!
I'll...

1107
01:25:21,576 --> 01:25:23,453
Come here!

1108
01:25:23,536 --> 01:25:25,872
All right, all right, all right.
Come here! Come here!

1109
01:25:25,955 --> 01:25:27,248
- Come on!
- Come on, now.

1110
01:25:27,332 --> 01:25:29,375
- I'll kill him!
- Come on, now, Darryl.

1111
01:25:29,459 --> 01:25:30,293
I'll kill you!

1112
01:25:53,358 --> 01:25:54,776
What will it be, ladies?

1113
01:25:54,859 --> 01:25:57,278
Fill her up. There you go.

1114
01:26:01,032 --> 01:26:02,617
Excuse me. Do you have a phone?

1115
01:26:05,495 --> 01:26:06,496
Thank you.

1116
01:26:07,372 --> 01:26:09,707
Thelma, listen up, now.
If you even think he knows...

1117
01:26:09,791 --> 01:26:12,710
Even if you're not sure,
I want you to hang up.

1118
01:26:12,794 --> 01:26:14,379
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1119
01:26:52,417 --> 01:26:53,418
Hello.

1120
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:55,336
Darryl, it's me.

1121
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:57,005
Thelma, hello!

1122
01:27:00,008 --> 01:27:01,175
- He knows.
- Shit.

1123
01:27:01,259 --> 01:27:03,052
I need more time.

1124
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:08,933
What? All I said was hello.

1125
01:27:32,749 --> 01:27:33,750
Yep?

1126
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:36,252
Darryl, this is Louise.
Let me talk to the police.

1127
01:27:36,336 --> 01:27:38,671
- Hey, Louise.
- Hi.

1128
01:27:38,755 --> 01:27:40,757
Let me talk to the police.

1129
01:27:41,507 --> 01:27:44,177
There... What do you mean?
There's no police here.

1130
01:27:45,762 --> 01:27:47,430
Hey, where are you girls anyway?

1131
01:27:47,513 --> 01:27:50,433
Just wait... Darryl, will you let me talk
to whoever is in charge there?

1132
01:27:50,516 --> 01:27:52,101
How do you know there's...

1133
01:27:52,185 --> 01:27:55,188
Hello, Miss... Miss Sawyer?

1134
01:27:55,271 --> 01:27:59,150
I'm Investigator Hal Slocombe,
Arkansas State Police.

1135
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:02,528
- How are you?
- Well, I've been better.

1136
01:28:03,571 --> 01:28:06,908
- You be careful with that gun.
- Yes, sir, I know.

1137
01:28:06,991 --> 01:28:11,204
You girls are in some hot water.
You both okay? Neither one of you hurt?

1138
01:28:11,287 --> 01:28:13,831
Oh, yes, sir, we're... we're fine.
We're both fine.

1139
01:28:13,915 --> 01:28:14,999
Good.

1140
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:20,046
- You want to tell me what happened?
- Sure. Over coffee sometime. I'll buy.

1141
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:24,509
I want you to know neither one of you
are charged with murder yet.

1142
01:28:25,343 --> 01:28:27,971
You're just still wanted for questioning.

1143
01:28:28,054 --> 01:28:32,058
Although now, Mrs. Dickinson is wanted
in Oklahoma for armed robbery.

1144
01:28:34,686 --> 01:28:37,939
No kiddin'? Look, we gotta go.
I'll call you back, all right?

1145
01:28:38,022 --> 01:28:40,900
I don't think you all
are gonna make it to Mexico.

1146
01:28:40,984 --> 01:28:45,196
We should talk.
Please. I want to help you.

1147
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:46,990
Shit.

1148
01:28:47,949 --> 01:28:51,411
God, that J.D. kid is a little shit.

1149
01:28:52,245 --> 01:28:54,622
What? What?

1150
01:28:55,832 --> 01:28:58,960
Thelma, how did they know
we're goin' to Mexico, huh?

1151
01:28:59,043 --> 01:29:00,336
How did they know that?

1152
01:29:01,838 --> 01:29:05,258
You told that thievin' little shit
where we were goin'?

1153
01:29:07,969 --> 01:29:08,970
I just...

1154
01:29:09,053 --> 01:29:12,724
I just told him if he ever got to Mexico,
he should look us up.

1155
01:29:12,807 --> 01:29:16,060
But I... I just...
I asked him not to tell.

1156
01:29:16,144 --> 01:29:21,065
I mean, I... I... I thought
he would not tell anybody, you know.

1157
01:29:21,149 --> 01:29:22,650
- Why?
- I didn't think he'd tell anybody.

1158
01:29:22,734 --> 01:29:25,528
Why? What's he got to lose?
Except my life savings, of course.

1159
01:29:25,611 --> 01:29:27,947
Oh, shit! Thelma, goddamn it!

1160
01:29:29,365 --> 01:29:31,492
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.
I mean, I...

1161
01:29:31,576 --> 01:29:33,327
Oh, goddamn it, Thelma!

1162
01:29:33,411 --> 01:29:35,747
Look, up until now,
we had only two things going for us.

1163
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:38,207
Nobody knew where we were
and nobody knew where we were goin'.

1164
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:40,752
Now one of the things
we had goin' for us is gone!

1165
01:29:50,053 --> 01:29:53,389
Look, Thelma,
you just gotta stop talkin' to people.

1166
01:29:53,473 --> 01:29:55,099
You gotta stop bein' so open.

1167
01:29:55,183 --> 01:30:00,104
We're fugitives now. All right?
Let's start behavin' like that.

1168
01:30:01,147 --> 01:30:02,940
- You're right.
- Thank you.

1169
01:30:03,024 --> 01:30:04,859
Okay.

1170
01:30:05,985 --> 01:30:07,570
I was wondering...

1171
01:30:07,653 --> 01:30:11,032
Listen, little boy,
of course I want you to go.

1172
01:30:11,115 --> 01:30:13,993
If that's what's worrying you,
please don't think...

1173
01:30:14,077 --> 01:30:17,163
No, I wasn't worrying about that.

1174
01:30:17,246 --> 01:30:20,333
I knew you'd want me
to take the job, sure, but...

1175
01:30:23,461 --> 01:30:25,213
Sorry.

1176
01:30:25,296 --> 01:30:27,465
Judy, let's get married.

1177
01:30:36,516 --> 01:30:38,392
My God, this is beautiful.

1178
01:30:39,685 --> 01:30:41,270
It surely is.

1179
01:30:42,772 --> 01:30:45,733
I always wanted to travel.
I just never got the opportunity.

1180
01:30:47,902 --> 01:30:49,070
You got it now.

1181
01:32:59,158 --> 01:33:00,576
What's going on?

1182
01:33:04,747 --> 01:33:05,957
Nothin'.

1183
01:33:19,303 --> 01:33:22,098
Shit. Well, we don't need
the East Coast anymore.

1184
01:33:26,978 --> 01:33:28,562
Hey, look!

1185
01:33:28,646 --> 01:33:30,648
Look who it is. It's that guy.
I'll be darned.

1186
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:32,108
Ignore him.

1187
01:33:33,943 --> 01:33:38,698
Hey, baby!
I'm your Captain Muff Diver!

1188
01:33:38,781 --> 01:33:43,869
Your storm trooper of love!

1189
01:33:45,413 --> 01:33:48,416
Hey!

1190
01:33:48,499 --> 01:33:49,875
I ignored him.

1191
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:32,084
What?

1192
01:34:32,168 --> 01:34:34,670
- What?
- Harlan.

1193
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:37,715
What about him?

1194
01:34:37,798 --> 01:34:39,383
Nothin'.

1195
01:34:40,217 --> 01:34:42,553
Just...

1196
01:34:42,636 --> 01:34:45,848
Just the look on his face
when...

1197
01:34:46,599 --> 01:34:47,725
What?

1198
01:34:48,559 --> 01:34:52,563
He sure wasn't expectin' that.

1199
01:34:55,399 --> 01:34:57,777
Suck my dick.

1200
01:34:58,944 --> 01:35:01,280
Thelma, it's not funny.

1201
01:35:03,324 --> 01:35:04,784
I know.

1202
01:35:13,167 --> 01:35:14,418
It happened to you, didn't it?

1203
01:35:16,837 --> 01:35:18,506
What? What are you talkin' about?

1204
01:35:19,548 --> 01:35:20,716
In Texas.

1205
01:35:21,592 --> 01:35:24,178
I mean, that's what...
that's what happened, isn't it?

1206
01:35:25,346 --> 01:35:26,514
You was raped.

1207
01:35:31,769 --> 01:35:35,106
Hey, now, look. I'm warnin' you.
Just drop it.

1208
01:35:35,189 --> 01:35:36,649
I'm not gonna talk about that.

1209
01:35:38,317 --> 01:35:40,152
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1210
01:35:40,236 --> 01:35:41,904
- I'm not talkin' about it.
- Okay.

1211
01:35:41,987 --> 01:35:44,782
- You understand?
- Yeah. Okay, Louise.

1212
01:35:50,913 --> 01:35:51,914
It's okay.

1213
01:35:56,168 --> 01:35:57,378
It's okay.

1214
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:35,416
Oh, shit!
Thelma, we're getting pulled over.

1215
01:36:35,499 --> 01:36:36,584
All right.

1216
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:40,671
Shit! Shit! What do you wanna do?
What should we do?

1217
01:36:40,754 --> 01:36:43,966
I don't know. I don't know. Oh, shi...
All right, we'll play it by ear.

1218
01:36:44,049 --> 01:36:45,968
Maybe he doesn't know.
Maybe he's gonna give me a ticket.

1219
01:36:46,051 --> 01:36:47,052
Oh, God.

1220
01:36:47,136 --> 01:36:49,096
Oh, God, please don't let us get caught.

1221
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:51,348
God, please, please, God.
Don't let us get caught.

1222
01:36:51,432 --> 01:36:52,766
I'm just gonna pull over.

1223
01:37:11,035 --> 01:37:12,453
Turn off your engine.

1224
01:37:19,335 --> 01:37:20,544
Putting on his hat.

1225
01:37:32,431 --> 01:37:33,807
Oh, my God, he's a Nazi.

1226
01:37:33,891 --> 01:37:36,352
- What's he doing?
- He's kinda walking this way.

1227
01:37:43,484 --> 01:37:45,152
Hello, Officer.

1228
01:37:46,111 --> 01:37:47,321
Is there a problem?

1229
01:37:47,905 --> 01:37:49,865
You want to let me see
your license, please?

1230
01:37:51,033 --> 01:37:52,034
Right.

1231
01:37:53,452 --> 01:37:54,620
Here it is.

1232
01:37:55,621 --> 01:37:58,582
- You wanna take it out of your wallet?
- All right.

1233
01:37:59,625 --> 01:38:01,293
I told you to slow down.

1234
01:38:01,377 --> 01:38:03,128
Officer, I told her to slow down.

1235
01:38:03,212 --> 01:38:04,255
She did.

1236
01:38:04,338 --> 01:38:06,840
- How fast was I goin'?
- About 110.

1237
01:38:06,924 --> 01:38:07,758
Fuck.

1238
01:38:07,841 --> 01:38:09,635
You wanna get out of the car, please?

1239
01:38:09,718 --> 01:38:11,554
Yes, sir. Sure.

1240
01:38:15,849 --> 01:38:17,393
Come with me, please.

1241
01:38:17,476 --> 01:38:18,602
Yes, sir.

1242
01:38:21,605 --> 01:38:24,692
- This your vehicle?
- Yes, sir, that is.

1243
01:38:27,903 --> 01:38:29,446
You wanna get in the car, please?

1244
01:38:30,281 --> 01:38:31,907
Yes, sir...

1245
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,494
- Front or the back?
- Front.

1246
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:41,834
You wanna take off your eyewear, please?

1247
01:38:41,917 --> 01:38:42,918
Yes, sir.

1248
01:38:46,672 --> 01:38:48,924
Am I in trouble, officer?

1249
01:38:49,008 --> 01:38:51,719
As far as I'm concerned,
yes, ma'am, you're in a lot of trouble.

1250
01:38:53,596 --> 01:38:54,805
Hello, this is 9-8...

1251
01:38:55,889 --> 01:38:58,517
You wanna step back
and get in your car again, please?

1252
01:38:58,601 --> 01:39:03,397
Officer, I am so sorry about this,
but would you let go of that?

1253
01:39:05,107 --> 01:39:07,401
Now, I really, really apologize,

1254
01:39:07,484 --> 01:39:09,570
but would you put your hands
on the steering wheel?

1255
01:39:10,529 --> 01:39:12,156
See, if you get on that radio,

1256
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:14,533
you're gonna find out
that we're wanted in two states

1257
01:39:14,617 --> 01:39:16,452
and probably considered
armed and dangerous.

1258
01:39:16,535 --> 01:39:18,162
At least I am.

1259
01:39:18,245 --> 01:39:21,290
And then our whole plan's
just gonna be all shot to hell.

1260
01:39:21,373 --> 01:39:23,459
Louise, take his gun.

1261
01:39:24,585 --> 01:39:25,711
Take his gun, Louise.

1262
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:28,255
- Right there.
- Right.

1263
01:39:28,339 --> 01:39:29,632
I'm real sorry. Excuse me.

1264
01:39:29,715 --> 01:39:31,925
You want to step out of the car, please?

1265
01:39:36,013 --> 01:39:37,264
Now, I swear, three days ago,

1266
01:39:37,348 --> 01:39:39,850
neither one of us would have ever
pulled a stunt like this,

1267
01:39:39,933 --> 01:39:42,311
but if you was ever to meet my husband,
you'd understand why.

1268
01:39:43,437 --> 01:39:45,272
Wanna put your hands on your head, please?

1269
01:39:46,273 --> 01:39:47,733
- Louise.
- What?

1270
01:39:47,816 --> 01:39:49,693
- Shoot the radio.
- Right.

1271
01:39:54,281 --> 01:39:56,325
The police radio, Louise.

1272
01:39:56,408 --> 01:39:58,243
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm sorry.

1273
01:40:01,997 --> 01:40:03,957
- Got it.
- Okay.

1274
01:40:04,041 --> 01:40:06,001
You wanna step
to the back of the car, please?

1275
01:40:07,878 --> 01:40:10,297
- Louise, get the keys.
- Yeah.

1276
01:40:15,177 --> 01:40:17,388
What happened?

1277
01:40:17,471 --> 01:40:19,348
- What...
- Air holes.

1278
01:40:19,431 --> 01:40:20,724
Open the trunk.

1279
01:40:22,893 --> 01:40:25,437
Shit, Thelma.
Who would've thought it?

1280
01:40:26,313 --> 01:40:29,441
Wanna step into the trunk, please?

1281
01:40:29,525 --> 01:40:33,612
Please. I have a wife and kids.
Please!

1282
01:40:33,696 --> 01:40:35,656
You do? Well, you're lucky.

1283
01:40:35,739 --> 01:40:38,450
You be sweet to 'em,
especially your wife.

1284
01:40:38,534 --> 01:40:41,245
My husband wasn't sweet to me.
Look how I turned out.

1285
01:40:41,328 --> 01:40:43,122
Now, go on. Get in there.

1286
01:40:44,498 --> 01:40:47,292
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second. Excuse me.

1287
01:40:47,376 --> 01:40:50,295
Wait a minute.
Officer, could I have your belt, please?

1288
01:40:52,005 --> 01:40:54,091
- Extra ammo.
- Good idea.

1289
01:40:54,174 --> 01:40:57,469
And... And could I trade glasses
with you maybe?

1290
01:40:59,471 --> 01:41:00,806
Thanks. Okay.

1291
01:41:00,889 --> 01:41:02,558
Okay. Is that it?

1292
01:41:02,641 --> 01:41:04,643
Right.

1293
01:41:04,727 --> 01:41:07,187
Officer, I'm real sorry about this.

1294
01:41:07,271 --> 01:41:08,480
I apologize also.

1295
01:41:11,024 --> 01:41:12,985
Go.

1296
01:41:18,157 --> 01:41:19,408
- You ready?
- Hit it.

1297
01:41:24,371 --> 01:41:25,956
Now, I know it's crazy,

1298
01:41:27,624 --> 01:41:29,918
but I just feel like
I got a knack for this shit.

1299
01:41:30,002 --> 01:41:31,462
I believe you do.

1300
01:41:34,465 --> 01:41:35,466
Drive like hell.

1301
01:41:42,181 --> 01:41:45,601
I can't figure out
whether these girls are real smart

1302
01:41:45,684 --> 01:41:47,978
or just real, real lucky.

1303
01:41:48,061 --> 01:41:49,438
It don't matter.

1304
01:41:50,397 --> 01:41:53,650
Brains will only get you so far
and luck always runs out.

1305
01:41:56,737 --> 01:41:59,656
- We still going to Mexico?
- Yeah.

1306
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:02,701
Then aren't we going
in the wrong direction?

1307
01:42:03,702 --> 01:42:05,829
Well, I figure
if you take a state policeman,

1308
01:42:05,913 --> 01:42:08,290
shoot up his car,
take his gun and lock him in the trunk,

1309
01:42:08,373 --> 01:42:10,501
it's best just to get on
out of the state if you can.

1310
01:42:10,584 --> 01:42:11,794
I heard that.

1311
01:42:11,877 --> 01:42:14,838
Hey! Hey!

1312
01:42:14,922 --> 01:42:16,882
Don't dent my car!

1313
01:42:21,386 --> 01:42:22,971
I think I fucked up.

1314
01:42:25,974 --> 01:42:28,644
I think I got us in a situation
where we both could get killed.

1315
01:42:31,063 --> 01:42:33,357
I don't know why I just didn't go
to the police right away.

1316
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,776
You know why. You already said.

1317
01:42:37,152 --> 01:42:39,947
- What did I say again?
- Nobody'd believe us.

1318
01:42:40,864 --> 01:42:43,367
We'd still get in trouble.
We'd still have our lives ruined.

1319
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:47,120
- You know what else?
- What?

1320
01:42:47,204 --> 01:42:48,956
That guy was hurting me.

1321
01:42:49,957 --> 01:42:53,168
If you hadn't come out when you did,
he would have hurt me a lot worse.

1322
01:42:53,252 --> 01:42:54,920
And probably nothin'
would've happened to him

1323
01:42:55,003 --> 01:42:56,839
'cause everybody did see me
dancin' with him all night.

1324
01:42:56,922 --> 01:42:59,091
They would've made out
like I'd asked for it.

1325
01:43:01,051 --> 01:43:03,470
My life would've been ruined
a whole lot worse than it is now.

1326
01:43:04,388 --> 01:43:06,139
Least now I'm havin' some fun.

1327
01:43:08,141 --> 01:43:11,061
And I'm not sorry
that son of a bitch is dead.

1328
01:43:11,144 --> 01:43:13,397
I'm just sorry
it was you that did it and not me.

1329
01:43:30,873 --> 01:43:31,999
Hello?

1330
01:43:32,082 --> 01:43:33,834
Let me talk to Slocombe.

1331
01:43:35,335 --> 01:43:36,503
She wants to talk to you.

1332
01:43:42,467 --> 01:43:44,469
- Hello, Louise.
- Hey.

1333
01:43:44,553 --> 01:43:46,722
- How are things going out there?
- Weird.

1334
01:43:46,805 --> 01:43:49,975
We got some kind of a snowball effect
happening here or somethin'.

1335
01:43:50,058 --> 01:43:52,644
You're still with us though.

1336
01:43:52,728 --> 01:43:54,354
You're somewhere
on the face of the earth.

1337
01:43:54,438 --> 01:43:57,107
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere,
but we can see it from here.

1338
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:59,902
I swear.

1339
01:44:00,986 --> 01:44:02,905
Louise, I almost feel like I know you.

1340
01:44:02,988 --> 01:44:04,364
Well, you don't.

1341
01:44:04,448 --> 01:44:06,617
You're getting in deeper
every moment you're gone.

1342
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:09,244
Would you believe me if I told you
this whole thing was an accident?

1343
01:44:09,328 --> 01:44:13,248
I do believe you.
That's what I want everybody to believe.

1344
01:44:14,207 --> 01:44:17,002
Trouble is,
it doesn't look like an accident,

1345
01:44:17,085 --> 01:44:19,421
and you're not here to tell me about it.

1346
01:44:20,672 --> 01:44:22,257
I need your help here.

1347
01:44:22,341 --> 01:44:24,509
- Did Harlan Puckett...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1348
01:44:24,593 --> 01:44:27,846
- You wanna come on in?
- Don't think so.

1349
01:44:29,097 --> 01:44:30,682
Then I'm sorry.

1350
01:44:30,766 --> 01:44:32,434
We're gonna have to charge you
with murder.

1351
01:44:33,143 --> 01:44:34,937
Do you wanna come out of this alive?

1352
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:39,316
You know, certain words and phrases
just keep drifting through my mind.

1353
01:44:39,399 --> 01:44:41,693
Things like incarceration,

1354
01:44:41,777 --> 01:44:44,196
cavity search, death by electrocution,
life imprisonment.

1355
01:44:44,279 --> 01:44:46,448
Shit like that.
You know what I'm saying?

1356
01:44:46,531 --> 01:44:48,367
So do I want to come out alive?

1357
01:44:49,159 --> 01:44:50,827
I don't know. I...

1358
01:44:56,083 --> 01:44:59,670
I don't know. I think we're gonna
have to think about that.

1359
01:44:59,753 --> 01:45:03,799
Louise, I'll do anything.

1360
01:45:06,927 --> 01:45:08,845
I know what's making you run.

1361
01:45:10,138 --> 01:45:11,974
I know what happened to you in Texas.

1362
01:45:18,105 --> 01:45:19,523
Come on, Louise.

1363
01:45:21,233 --> 01:45:23,026
Don't blow it.

1364
01:45:23,110 --> 01:45:24,236
We got it!

1365
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:27,072
Give it to me.

1366
01:45:27,155 --> 01:45:28,240
God...

1367
01:45:34,037 --> 01:45:35,998
Max, you gotta take me there.

1368
01:45:36,081 --> 01:45:37,708
No, Hal, cannot do. Sorry.

1369
01:45:37,791 --> 01:45:40,669
- I'm the only one she's ever spoken to.
- You've done a good job.

1370
01:45:40,752 --> 01:45:43,130
You're no good to me now.
There's nothing you can do for me now.

1371
01:45:43,213 --> 01:45:45,924
I don't want anybody losing their heads!

1372
01:45:46,008 --> 01:45:47,217
You know what happens.

1373
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:48,593
The volume gets turned way up,

1374
01:45:48,677 --> 01:45:50,971
and the next thing you know,
these girls are gonna get shot!

1375
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:04,401
What?

1376
01:46:06,445 --> 01:46:09,072
You're not gonna give up on me, are you?

1377
01:46:09,156 --> 01:46:10,240
What do you mean?

1378
01:46:11,575 --> 01:46:13,493
You're not gonna make a deal
with that guy?

1379
01:46:13,577 --> 01:46:16,913
I mean, I just want to know.

1380
01:46:18,457 --> 01:46:20,959
Thelma, I'm not making any deals.

1381
01:46:24,671 --> 01:46:28,717
I mean, I'd understand
if you was thinkin' about it.

1382
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:32,345
In a way, you got somethin'
to go back for, Jimmy and all.

1383
01:46:32,429 --> 01:46:33,889
Jimmy's not an option.

1384
01:46:36,808 --> 01:46:38,143
But...

1385
01:46:39,394 --> 01:46:40,687
I don't know, you know,

1386
01:46:41,563 --> 01:46:46,234
something's, like, crossed over in me,

1387
01:46:46,318 --> 01:46:49,071
and I can't go back.

1388
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:53,700
I mean, I just couldn't live.

1389
01:46:53,784 --> 01:46:57,120
I know. I know what you mean.

1390
01:46:59,664 --> 01:47:03,085
Anyway, we don't want to end up
on the damn Geraldo show.

1391
01:47:03,168 --> 01:47:06,129
Yeah.

1392
01:47:13,178 --> 01:47:15,680
They're charging us with murder.

1393
01:47:18,725 --> 01:47:22,771
Yeah, they say that we gotta figure out
if we want to come in dead or alive.

1394
01:47:24,523 --> 01:47:27,692
Gosh.
Did he say anything positive at all?

1395
01:47:54,886 --> 01:47:55,887
You awake?

1396
01:47:57,347 --> 01:47:59,307
Guess you could call it that.
My eyes are open.

1397
01:48:00,725 --> 01:48:03,311
Me too. I feel awake.

1398
01:48:03,395 --> 01:48:04,521
Good.

1399
01:48:05,605 --> 01:48:09,609
Wide-awake.
I don't remember ever feeling this awake.

1400
01:48:09,693 --> 01:48:11,319
You know what I mean?

1401
01:48:12,404 --> 01:48:13,947
Everything looks different.

1402
01:48:15,740 --> 01:48:19,077
You feel like that too,
like you got something to look forward to?

1403
01:48:21,705 --> 01:48:24,040
We'll be drinking margaritas
by the sea, mamacita.

1404
01:48:25,167 --> 01:48:27,460
- We could change our names.
- We could live in a hacienda.

1405
01:48:27,544 --> 01:48:29,337
I'm gonna get a job.

1406
01:48:29,421 --> 01:48:31,214
I'm gonna work at Club Med.

1407
01:48:31,298 --> 01:48:33,925
Yeah.

1408
01:48:34,009 --> 01:48:37,095
What kind of a deal is that cop
gonna have to come up with to beat that?

1409
01:48:37,804 --> 01:48:39,890
- Have to be pretty good.
- Have to be pretty damn good.

1410
01:49:15,592 --> 01:49:19,971
Oh, my God, Louise! Look, look!
Think that's him.

1411
01:49:21,806 --> 01:49:24,309
It's him. It's definitely him.

1412
01:49:25,185 --> 01:49:26,353
Pass him.

1413
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:45,497
Hey, baby!

1414
01:49:46,873 --> 01:49:48,291
You ready for a big dick?

1415
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:02,347
- Hi.
- Hi there. You all right?

1416
01:50:02,430 --> 01:50:04,224
We're fine. How are you?

1417
01:50:04,307 --> 01:50:06,309
Great!

1418
01:50:07,310 --> 01:50:09,646
You girls about ready to get serious?

1419
01:50:12,732 --> 01:50:13,775
I think so.

1420
01:50:15,318 --> 01:50:16,820
Follow us.

1421
01:51:15,879 --> 01:51:18,381
- Where you going?
- Fresno.

1422
01:51:18,465 --> 01:51:20,884
We've been seein' you all over the place.

1423
01:51:20,967 --> 01:51:24,471
Why don't you take off those shades?
I want to see your eyes.

1424
01:51:25,221 --> 01:51:27,766
Yeah, I been seein' you too.

1425
01:51:27,849 --> 01:51:29,934
We think you have really bad manners.

1426
01:51:30,018 --> 01:51:31,394
Yeah!

1427
01:51:31,478 --> 01:51:35,482
Where do you get off behaving like that
with women you don't even know?

1428
01:51:39,277 --> 01:51:43,239
How'd you feel if somebody did that
to your mother? Or your sister?

1429
01:51:43,323 --> 01:51:45,200
Or your wife?

1430
01:51:45,283 --> 01:51:47,827
What are you talkin' about?

1431
01:51:47,911 --> 01:51:50,538
You know good and damn well
what I'm talking about.

1432
01:51:50,622 --> 01:51:51,790
I mean, really.

1433
01:51:51,873 --> 01:51:55,418
That business with your tongue.
What is that? That is disgusting!

1434
01:51:55,502 --> 01:51:59,964
And that other shit, pointing to your lap.
What is that supposed to mean exactly?

1435
01:52:00,048 --> 01:52:03,426
Pull over. I wanna show you
what a big, fat slob I am?

1436
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:05,178
Or does that mean, suck my dick?

1437
01:52:06,179 --> 01:52:08,223
- You women are crazy!
- You got that right.

1438
01:52:08,306 --> 01:52:10,183
We think you should apologize.

1439
01:52:11,017 --> 01:52:13,186
I ain't apologizing for shit!

1440
01:52:13,269 --> 01:52:14,729
You say you're sorry.

1441
01:52:16,189 --> 01:52:17,690
Fuck that!

1442
01:52:23,905 --> 01:52:27,909
You say you're sorry,
or I'm gonna make you fuckin' sorry.

1443
01:52:27,992 --> 01:52:30,078
Oh, Jesus.

1444
01:52:30,161 --> 01:52:33,123
I'll bet you even called us beavers
on your CB radio, didn't you?

1445
01:52:33,206 --> 01:52:35,083
Yeah. Sure did!

1446
01:52:35,792 --> 01:52:38,878
Damn. I hate that.
I hate being called a beaver. Don't you?

1447
01:52:38,962 --> 01:52:40,255
You gonna apologize or what?

1448
01:52:42,674 --> 01:52:44,384
Fuck you!

1449
01:52:53,351 --> 01:52:57,230
Goddamn, you bitch!

1450
01:52:58,982 --> 01:53:02,110
- I don't think he is gonna apologize.
- Nah, I don't think so.

1451
01:53:15,582 --> 01:53:17,500
You bitches!

1452
01:53:17,584 --> 01:53:22,297
You bitches from hell! Goddamn it!

1453
01:53:23,214 --> 01:53:25,800
You're gonna have to pay for this!

1454
01:53:27,677 --> 01:53:30,263
You're gonna have to pay for that!

1455
01:53:30,346 --> 01:53:32,682
I'm gonna make you!

1456
01:53:40,648 --> 01:53:44,944
I'm gonna make you pay for this!
You hear me?

1457
01:53:49,115 --> 01:53:51,826
Oh, my God!

1458
01:53:52,577 --> 01:53:56,039
- Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
- Oh, off the TV.

1459
01:53:57,332 --> 01:53:59,751
How about you?
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?

1460
01:53:59,834 --> 01:54:01,002
Texas.

1461
01:54:16,851 --> 01:54:20,396
Hello! Hello! Hello!

1462
01:55:04,941 --> 01:55:08,861
Hello? Hello?
I'm in the trunk. I'm a police officer.

1463
01:55:10,321 --> 01:55:13,783
The keys are over there.
The keys are over there.

1464
01:55:27,422 --> 01:55:30,925
D-I-D-10-17-55.

1465
01:55:31,009 --> 01:55:36,723
Red hair, brown eyes, 5'7" tall,
120 pounds.

1466
01:55:36,806 --> 01:55:40,143
Suspect, Thelma Yvonne Dickinson.

1467
01:55:40,226 --> 01:55:41,603
White female...

1468
01:55:41,686 --> 01:55:44,731
We got this guy running
around a burning truck.

1469
01:55:44,814 --> 01:55:50,903
Red hair, green eyes,
5'10" tall, 130 pounds.

1470
01:55:50,987 --> 01:55:54,073
Both subjects armed
and extremely dangerous.

1471
01:55:54,157 --> 01:55:55,575
Approach with caution.

1472
01:55:55,658 --> 01:55:58,828
New Mexico and Arizona on felony warrants

1473
01:55:58,911 --> 01:56:02,457
for armed robbery,
kidnapping a law enforcement officer,

1474
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:04,667
assault with a deadly weapon.

1475
01:56:04,751 --> 01:56:09,005
Suspect driving,
Louise Elizabeth Sawyer, white fe...

1476
01:56:27,523 --> 01:56:28,650
Think they saw us?

1477
01:56:33,488 --> 01:56:35,365
I don't know. I don't think so.

1478
01:56:35,448 --> 01:56:37,200
We better get off, just in case.

1479
01:57:20,159 --> 01:57:21,536
You got your seat belt on?

1480
01:57:22,704 --> 01:57:27,041
This is 1-12. I am in pursuit.
Green Thunderbird. Requesting assistance.

1481
01:57:30,378 --> 01:57:32,088
Oh, shit.

1482
01:57:36,217 --> 01:57:39,011
We have the suspects in sight.
Continuing pursuit.

1483
01:57:44,767 --> 01:57:45,768
Stay in position!

1484
01:57:52,358 --> 01:57:54,610
I know this whole thing was my fault.
I know it.

1485
01:57:54,694 --> 01:57:57,697
Damn it. If there's one thing you should
know by now, this wasn't your fault!

1486
01:57:59,157 --> 01:58:02,910
Louise, no matter what happens,
I'm glad I came with you.

1487
01:58:03,703 --> 01:58:04,746
Shit.

1488
01:58:10,918 --> 01:58:13,296
Oh, shit.

1489
01:58:16,007 --> 01:58:18,509
Did you see that guy?
He was right in the middle of the road!

1490
01:58:32,523 --> 01:58:33,733
Hold on!

1491
01:58:56,839 --> 01:58:59,050
I guess everything from here on in
is gonna be pretty shitty.

1492
01:58:59,133 --> 01:59:00,510
Unbearable, I'd imagine.

1493
01:59:00,593 --> 01:59:02,553
Everything we got to lose
is already gone.

1494
01:59:02,637 --> 01:59:04,680
Oh, God.
How do you stay so positive?

1495
01:59:18,277 --> 01:59:19,946
Get him outta there.

1496
02:00:10,037 --> 02:00:13,291
- You're a good friend.
- You too, sweetie. The best.

1497
02:00:16,168 --> 02:00:18,713
How do you like the vacation so far?

1498
02:00:23,801 --> 02:00:25,887
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?

1499
02:00:25,970 --> 02:00:28,014
No, you've always been crazy.

1500
02:00:28,931 --> 02:00:31,559
This is just the first chance
you've had to really express yourself.

1501
02:00:37,523 --> 02:00:38,524
Good drivin'.

1502
02:00:41,444 --> 02:00:42,445
Thanks.

1503
02:01:54,976 --> 02:01:56,394
Oh, my God.

1504
02:01:57,853 --> 02:01:59,230
What in the hell is this?

1505
02:02:00,439 --> 02:02:02,733
I don't know. I think...

1506
02:02:02,817 --> 02:02:04,902
I think it's the goddamn Grand Canyon.

1507
02:02:05,945 --> 02:02:08,906
Isn't it beautiful?

1508
02:02:10,199 --> 02:02:13,452
Yeah. It's something else, all right.

1509
02:03:18,809 --> 02:03:22,021
Oh, my God. It looks like the army.

1510
02:03:22,104 --> 02:03:23,731
All this for us?

1511
02:03:23,814 --> 02:03:27,151
Hey, don't let them shoot those girls!

1512
02:03:27,234 --> 02:03:29,320
This is too much.
They got guns pointin' at 'em!

1513
02:03:29,403 --> 02:03:31,906
These women are armed, Hal.
This is standard.

1514
02:03:31,989 --> 02:03:34,241
Now, calm down.
These boys know what they're doing.

1515
02:03:35,951 --> 02:03:38,329
Place your hands in plain view.

1516
02:03:38,412 --> 02:03:40,915
Any failure to obey that command

1517
02:03:40,998 --> 02:03:44,919
will be considered
an act of aggression against us.

1518
02:03:48,005 --> 02:03:54,345
I repeat, turn your engine off
and place your hands in plain view.

1519
02:03:59,058 --> 02:04:00,893
What are you doin'?

1520
02:04:00,976 --> 02:04:02,436
I'm not givin' up.

1521
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:04,772
Max, you gotta do something!

1522
02:04:04,855 --> 02:04:06,232
How many times, Max?

1523
02:04:06,315 --> 02:04:08,734
How many times has that woman
got to be fucked over?

1524
02:04:08,818 --> 02:04:10,820
Hey, listen!
Will you pull yourself together?

1525
02:04:10,903 --> 02:04:12,196
Now, listen to me!

1526
02:04:12,279 --> 02:04:14,198
You calm down.
Don't make me sorry I brought you.

1527
02:04:14,281 --> 02:04:15,908
Damn it!

1528
02:04:15,991 --> 02:04:22,248
I repeat, cut your engine off
and place your hands in plain view!

1529
02:04:28,546 --> 02:04:31,507
Okay, then, listen.
Let's not get caught.

1530
02:04:33,717 --> 02:04:35,136
What are you talkin' about?

1531
02:04:37,346 --> 02:04:38,639
Let's keep goin'.

1532
02:04:40,057 --> 02:04:41,183
What do you mean?

1533
02:04:45,271 --> 02:04:46,438
Go!

1534
02:04:52,111 --> 02:04:53,237
You sure?

1535
02:04:56,157 --> 02:04:57,158
Yeah.

1536
02:04:58,576 --> 02:04:59,910
Hit it.

1537
02:05:15,551 --> 02:05:16,552
Hey!
