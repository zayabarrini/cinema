Thanks for your support so far.

"Sell belongings"

00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:14,667
We can pay for 30,000 yen in total.

"Bank"

6
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,959
I'll withdraw all.

Director : Naoko Yamada

12
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:57,250
Hey, sit down all.

13
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,417
We have a new classmate from today.

14
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:08,584
What?

15
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,459
You lucky!  A girl.

16
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:15,083
I'm not interested at all.

17
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:29,816
Well,

18
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,918
Then introduce yourself.

19
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,584
Huh?

20
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,777
Oh...

21
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,857
"For written communication"

22
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,977
"Nice to meet you.  I am Shoko Nishimiya."

23
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,501
"I want to be friends with you all with this notebook."

24
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:17,083
"Please use this notebook when talk to me."

25
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,709
"I can't hear."

26
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:30,584
Unbelievable...

27
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:39,959
Weird!

28
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:41,876
"Hi, Nishimiya-san.  I am Miki Kawai."

29
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:43,751
Hi, nice to meet you.

30
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:48,209
Hey, Nishimiya-san, can you speak Japanese?

31
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,000
Nao-chan, how you say...

32
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,417
"Once again please."

33
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:54,792
Aha...

34
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,667
Huh?

35
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:57,792
Ok.

36
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,918
What were you called from friends?

37
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:05,167
Give up, give up!

38
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:07,209
I see, "Sho-chan".

39
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:07,876
Huh?

40
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:10,083
That's same as Ishida.

41
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,792
She is called Sho-chan, too.

42
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,083
That's funny.

43
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,167
What?  Not funny at all!

44
00:06:19,501 --> 00:06:22,876
Please write down what I'm saying.

45
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,250
From page 20 to page 25, and drills of page 32.

46
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,250
It is the scope of the next small test.

47
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:31,751
Hey.

48
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,250
Give me your notebook.

49
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:40,459
First, "fulcrum". The point that supports the strength.

50
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:44,000
Next, "the effort point", the point the strength is taken.

51
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:47,626
The point that have weight is the point of loading.

52
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:50,626
With these 3 points,

53
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:13,751
Nishimiya-san,

54
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:16,417
You are too fast to start.

55
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:18,125
I will

56
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,167
teach you the timing, ok?

57
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,209
Then, let's start again from the beginning.

58
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:30,959
How should we do the coming chorus competition?

59
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,501
We already lose, don't we?

60
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:35,959
That's the penalty for saying weird things!

61
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,542
Ouch, ouch!

62
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,626
Ouch!

63
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,125
So today

64
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,584
I missed what teacher said again due to her...

65
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,375
I'll lend my notebook.

66
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:48,417
Thank you.

67
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:52,542
I am not wrong.

68
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,792
That's why I will never say sorry.

69
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:57,250
What a poor reading, Ueno.

70
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,417
Oh...

71
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,000
Crap.  That's enough.  Next.

72
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,667
To the hell, ugly glasses.

73
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:04,125
Nishimiya.

74
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,876
From this sentence.

75
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:15,167
Ztop do be zdabborn aboud zach zings.

76
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:20,584

78
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:25,375
Ok.  Good.  Next, Ishida.

79
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:27,709
Really? Unbelievable.

80
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,334
Hey, Ishida!

81
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,447
Hahaha...

82
00:08:47,538 --> 00:08:49,530
Please let me know what you are talking.

83
00:09:14,626 --> 00:09:15,876
Let's go home.

84
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,542
Bye-bye, Nishimiya-san.

85
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:53,709
Hey you,

86
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:59,000
At this rate, won't you frustrate classmates?

87
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:02,876
What?

88
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:09,167
fie-nds...

89
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,626
What?

90
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,626
Disgusting!

91
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:28,475
I'm Kita, of a special education class.

92
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:31,167
Today I wanna talk about "Shuwa" - sign language.

93
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:33,876
Write as "speaking with hands" and pronounce "Shu-wa".

94
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:38,501
As the word says, Shuwa means speaking using your hands.

95
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:40,209
Isn't it amazing?

96
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,167
Sign...language...

97
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:45,459
So I propose a 3-minute lesson of sign language everyday morning,

98
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:49,834
to understand Shoko-chan even more.

99
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:54,292
Teacher.

100
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,501
Yes?

101
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:57,959
Isn't it enough to use her notebook?

102
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:03,417
It's easier for Shoko-chan using sign language.

103
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:08,709
It's easier for me using notebook.

104
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:14,959
I'll learn sign language.

105
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,417
"Teach me sign language for Sahara Miyoko"

106
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,209
Sa - ara

107
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:26,751
I - jo - ko

108
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:28,334
Got it!

109
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:29,542
Sa - a ...

110
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,417
Good job getting brownie points.

111
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,209
I love him so much.  He is so handsome.

112
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:36,334
Agree!

113
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,834
He will be in the drama next week. Must watch!

114
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:42,209
Don't you think her clothes are ugly?

115
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:44,751
Stop it, Nao-chan.

116
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,876
The author described through this work,...

117
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,167
After the experiment, manganese dioxide should be...

118
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,292
Hirose, you write that side.

119
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,918
Ni-shi-mi-ya.

120
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:04,250
What are you doing, Ishida ?

121
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,876
Isn't better to stop that?

122
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:07,584
Star.

123
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,792
Ishida, you did too much.

124
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:12,417
No, no, it's what it should be.

125
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,167
You a bad guy.

126
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:17,459
Nice, nice.

127
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:19,459
It's really nice.

128
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,768
Congrat, Nishimiya-san. Sahara-san went away because of you!

129
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,589
Congrat, Nishimiya-san. Sahara-san went away because of you!

130
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:32,667
That's so bad! Who did such nasty things!

131
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:34,375
Too bad!

132
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,292
I...will...kindly...

133
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,417
erase...it...for...you...

134
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:41,709
Ok.

135
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,918
All erased.

136
00:12:57,257 --> 00:12:59,744
Thank you.

137
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:04,876
You are welcome.

138
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:06,501
Let's go.

139
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,167
Joumon-era was...

140
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,876
Hey, Ishida.

141
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:21,125
Class is not over.

142
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,667
I see.  I'm sorry.

143
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:27,334
Well...I have lost where I am talking..

144
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:30,834
Well, what kind of house were they living. They lived..

145
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,709
So surprised, are you?

146
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:37,375
Hey, Nishimiya-san.

147
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:43,209
Is this mean you can actually hear?

148
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:46,459
Yeah, I thought the same thing, too.

149
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:48,000
Please let me see it for a while?

150
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:52,292
Ueno.

151
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,501
What is it?  Gimme.

152
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,667
Oh, what is this?

153
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,751
It's filthy!

154
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:19,959
Ouch!

155
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:23,459
Wh--What?

156
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:24,209
Oh my god,

157
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,292
Nishimiya-san, are you ok?

158
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,876
How should I do....?

159
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:31,542
Nishimiya-san.

160
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,626
Hey, you did too far.

161
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:38,068
Crap, so annoying, ugly glasses.

162
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:43,042
What? Go away.

163
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:44,709
Don't interrupt.

164
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,042
What is she doing?

165
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:49,459
Let's go home.

166
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:52,411
"I'm sorry."

167
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:54,667
You liar!

168
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,751
If you want to say something to me, say it!

169
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:00,292
What!?

170
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:02,375
Stop it, you are disgusting!

171
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,792
Oh, Nishimiya-san is funny!

172
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:07,626
Shoya, you are blushing, aren't you?

173
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:09,250
No, I'm not!

174
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,250
Let's go.

175
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:30,083
Huh?

176
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,751
Oh, is she serious, Nishimiya-san?

177
00:15:32,918 --> 00:15:34,292
It's unbelievable!

178
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:46,250
See you tomorrow, Shoya.

179
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:04,334
Well, today I have a topic I want to talk to you all.

180
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:09,000
It's about Nishimiya-san, who is absent today.

181
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:13,709
Yesterday we had a call from Nishimiya-san's mother.

182
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:19,459
She said 8 of Nishimiya-san's hearing aids have gone missing

183
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:21,709
or been damaged in just 5 months.

184
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:26,501
Nishimiya-san's mother worries if she is bullied at school.

185
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:31,667
If any of you know anything about bullying

186
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:36,000
or similar harassment to Nishimiya-san, please let us know.

187
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:41,667
We hear her hearing aids are very expensive.

188
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:51,667
So please confess, before your parents are in trouble.

189
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:52,751
Hey, Ishida.

190
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:57,792
We all know it was you.

191
00:16:58,209 --> 00:16:59,501
Stand up right now!

192
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes.

193
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:03,876
Ueno.

194
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,375
How did you thought, seeing next to him?

195
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,542
Well...so...

196
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:12,751
He might do something to kidding her or so?

197
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:13,626
What?

198
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:15,125
How about you, Shimada?

199
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:16,667
I'd been saying

200
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:19,834
"hey, stop it" to him,

201
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,501
but Shoya didn't stopped.

202
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:22,334
What!?

203
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,792
Hey, Shimada,

204
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,459
You did with me together, didn't you?

205
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:30,209
And, girls said bad things about her so many times.

206
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:32,796
Hey!

207
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,250
Especially Ueno and Kawai did.

208
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,375
What!?

209
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,876
How cruel you are..

210
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:42,083
I never do such things.

211
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:43,834
Why you tell such a lie?

212
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,667
Ishida-kun, you are too bad.

213
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:47,334
He made her cry.

214
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,918
Huh?  Why it is here...?

215
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:20,792
I see.  Yes.

216
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:24,459
I'm very sorry.

217
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:27,375
I see.  I see.

218
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,209
Thank you for calling.

219
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:33,375
Shoya.

220
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:35,501
Stop now, Shoya!

221
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:37,542
Shoya.

222
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,876
I got a call from school.

223
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:41,751
You...

224
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:43,876
Why are you so wet?

225
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:46,751
Shut up,  Jumped in the river like always.

226
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,375
Wait, Shoya.

227
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:50,167
Don't you make a trouble with someone?

228
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,167
I don't know.

229
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:55,417
Is what your teacher said correct?

230
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,792
Y...Yes!

231
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:03,584
Prepare to go out right now.  We have to meet Nishimiya-san's.

232
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:10,468
(Mizuho Bank)

233
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,209
Sho-chan, let's go home.

234
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:16,876
Be a good child from tomorrow, ok?

235
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:21,751
Huh?  It's missing...

236
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:26,083
Great men and women experienced hard time, and...

237
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:49,042
Huh?

238
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:50,792
What?

239
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,209
What is she doing?

240
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,918
Hey, what are you doing with my desk?

241
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:04,792
What were you doing.  Disgusting!

242
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:12,125
Same smile again.

243
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:15,250
Don't pretend to be a good girl!

244
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:17,876
What?

245
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,250
If you wanna say something to me, say it now!

246
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,083
Every time you show that disgusting smile instead.

247
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:25,000
You are angry, aren't you!?

248
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,125
Hey!

249
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,375
Say something!

250
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:29,626
Ouch!

251
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:30,876
What you are doing!

252
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What do you mean!

253
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:45,334
Doigg mah bezd...

254
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,000
I'b doigg mah bezd!

255
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:52,834
What are you saying!

256
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:57,709
What!

257
00:21:57,834 --> 00:21:59,667
Cannot understand what you say!

258
00:22:19,747 --> 00:22:20,747
"Disappear"

259
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:29,542
Crap...

260
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,042
She is so disgusting...

261
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,042
Nishimiya-san has transferred to another school.

262
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,375
Huh.

263
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:42,250
Hey, class journal was not submitted today.

264
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,626
Who is in charge?

265
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:48,417
And, who is in charge of keeping the flowers?

266
00:23:09,713 --> 00:23:11,446
"Sign language study club"

267
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:25,209
Hi, Shoko-chan.  Hello.

268
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:36,667
Nishimiya!

269
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,250
Do you remember me?

270
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,542
I was your classmate of the elementary school...

271
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,334
Shoya Ishida.

272
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:01,792
Nishimiya?

273
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,250
Wait!

274
00:24:08,062 --> 00:24:09,062
Nishimiya!

275
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:13,292
Where?

276
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:15,375
Nishimiya.

277
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,375
H...Hi.

278
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:27,459
Well...

279
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:30,417
Here it is.

280
00:24:30,584 --> 00:24:32,709
I came here to give it to you.

281
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:36,959
This is what you left behind.

282
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:45,667
You say "why sign language?"

283
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:47,042
I leaned it.

284
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:49,584
And, here. ...

285
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:56,792
You might not want to see this again.

286
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,000
Well...

287
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:05,501
I...and...

288
00:25:05,626 --> 00:25:06,709
Nishimiya,

289
00:25:08,584 --> 00:25:10,167
Can we be

290
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,417
friends?

291
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:15,417
Damn, what am I saying!?

292
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:19,792
H...hey, you said so in the past.

293
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,417
I finally understood what you said...

294
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,417
Oh...Please don't cry.

295
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:31,417
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.

296
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:42,667
Can I be friends with you?

297
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,584
Sho-tan,

298
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,375
Sho-tan,

299
00:25:47,918 --> 00:25:51,125
Sho-tan, wake up!

300
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:55,501
Breakfast!

301
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:03,709
Sho-chan, wake up!

302
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,375
Good morning, Maria.

303
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,542
Sho-tan woke up!

304
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,375
I'll go.

305
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:32,584
Mama, bye bye!

306
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:34,000
Here, Sho-chan.

307
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:38,209
Let's eat.

308
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:40,292
Dig in!

309
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:46,000
Huh?

310
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,250
Why you are so smiling.

311
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:51,834
Because of...

312
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:53,667
this!

313
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:54,626
Oh.

314
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:57,209
You worked hard,

315
00:26:57,334 --> 00:27:00,542
and you sold everything, even including beddings.

316
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,209
I'm very happy for all of your efforts.

317
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,209
By the way, Sho-chan...

318
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:13,751
Why did you try to kill yourself?

319
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,667
Yah, actually,

320
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:20,459
It's a long story you know,

321
00:27:20,584 --> 00:27:22,334
But it comes to be..

322
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:23,959
I knew it...

323
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,501
Huh!?

324
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:27,834
I knew it!

325
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:29,667
I knew something was going on around you!

326
00:27:30,209 --> 00:27:34,000
Your room was extraordinarily vacant, your phone was out of service,

327
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:37,000
and the calendar...

328
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:40,375
Pages after April were torn off...

329
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:44,375
Right now promise you never try to kill yourself, or I'll burn this.

330
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:47,626
This 1,700,000 yen you worked hard and earned!

331
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:52,792
Hey, are you listening to me!?

332
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:54,834
Huh!?

333
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:56,125
Don't be stupid, mom...

334
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,083
YOU ARE stupid, what an ungrateful child you are!

335
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,751
Hey, well, ah...

336
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:00,918
Sorry.

337
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,375
I'm really sorry.

338
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:03,292
I'll stop.

339
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,042
I'll stop.  I'm sorry.

340
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,083
You'll stop what, say clearly!

341
00:28:07,918 --> 00:28:09,542
I'll stop trying to kill myself!

342
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,792
I'll stop trying to kill myself!

343
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:13,834
Really?

344
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:15,542
Really.

345
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:18,292
Ok, that's a promise.

346
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:22,083
Hey! Mon!

347
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,417
Ouch!

348
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:27,375
Hey, water, water!

349
00:28:36,501 --> 00:28:38,000
Yesterday, I had thought

350
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:41,751
to kill myself by jumping into a river from some very high bridge.

351
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:46,751
The reason I went to meet Nishimiya was also like a ceremony before it.

352
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:51,334
It was my biggest braveness challenge all of my life

353
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:53,292
but the story was changed...

354
00:29:07,584 --> 00:29:09,167
"Friend"

355
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:15,918
Shame!  Why did I say such a thing!?

356
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:20,250
When just entered junior high school, Shimada said;

357
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,459
You'd better stay away from a guy Shoya Ishida.

358
00:29:25,584 --> 00:29:26,626
He is...

359
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,959
a bully.

360
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:37,918
What I did will all return to myself.

361
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:40,167
I fully realized

362
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:44,626
that I had to owe the responsibility of what I had did.

363
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:48,667
And I was isolated.

364
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:51,042
Good morning.

365
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:28,417
Then

366
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:31,834
Translate these sentences by the next lesson.

367
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:42,292
Ishida-kun.

368
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:43,501
H-hi.

369
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:45,292
Kawai...

370
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:48,083
Can I gather your math homework if you finish it?

371
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,042
Oh...sorry, I have forgotten it.

372
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:51,292
Ok, I see.

373
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,250
Please finish it soon as the deadline is coming.

374
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,501
Yes, I will.  Sorry.

375
00:30:58,501 --> 00:31:00,083
Let's have a lunch outside.

376
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:06,375
"Ishida-kun is always alone as you can see."

377
00:31:06,501 --> 00:31:09,334
"Everyone knows it."

378
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:11,709
Oh, really?

379
00:31:11,876 --> 00:31:14,834
"Oh, he is looking at us as always."

380
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:17,834
"Isn't he feeling desperate always being alone?"

381
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,876
"He will be same as now forever."

382
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,334
"Why is he still living?"

383
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:28,792
H...Hi, here it is.

384
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:30,667
I just bought this limited edition, and...

385
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:31,959
Oops.

386
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,959
Then I'll quit to be a fan of them.

387
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,709
Me too.

388
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:42,626
That's the reality...

389
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,751
Huh?

390
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:04,584
I remember that hair.

391
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:07,709
Who is he?

392
00:32:18,292 --> 00:32:19,501
By the way,

393
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:22,584
can I meet Nishimiya again?

394
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:26,000
She said she feeds carp in the river.

395
00:32:26,626 --> 00:32:29,792
How can I do so by what reason?

396
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:34,292
Can I see her to apologize what I did?

397
00:32:35,876 --> 00:32:38,417
She said she will be there every Tuesday.

398
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:40,792
Am I weird if I visit again?

399
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:55,125
I'm home.

400
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,000
Sho---chan?

401
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:08,125
Woops,

402
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,876
I'm so surprised.

403
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:11,417
What?

404
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:16,083
I'm very sorry for what happened in the morning.

405
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,292
I burned money you earned hard.

406
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:26,334
But I don't want to use any money

407
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:27,959
you saved to die.

408
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:31,959
Sorry, I'll save up again.

409
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,167
Thanks.

410
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:36,334
You can be slower this time, ok?

411
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:38,792
You are hungry, huh?  Let's have dinner.

412
00:33:38,918 --> 00:33:40,667
Hungry!

413
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:52,542
Tuesday.

414
00:33:56,876 --> 00:33:59,876
Hey you, why don't you lend your bike to me?

415
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:00,774
Me?

416
00:34:00,825 --> 00:34:03,742
Oh, the guy I remember.

417
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,292
I left something behind.  I want to go home to get it.

418
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:10,250
Huh?  What are you saying?

419
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,209
You should use your own one.

420
00:34:12,334 --> 00:34:15,542
I ask you 'cause I don't have my own.

421
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,876
Stop it please.

422
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Hey, don't resist.

423
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:20,417
Oops. Stop it!

424
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:22,751
Someone please help me!

425
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:25,451
Someone!

426
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,459
Oh, dear.

427
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:29,042
Please, please help me!  Help!  Help!

428
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,667
Shut up!

429
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:35,918
Stop resisting!

430
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,000
H...hey.

431
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:40,250
I...I'll lend you my own.

432
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:44,334
Really!?  You are super!

433
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:50,292
It was ripped off.

434
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,876
Actually, today of all day is Tuesday.

435
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:57,501
This means I should not see her again?

436
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:00,417
Of course I still can go on foot,

437
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,667
but it seems as I was advised not to go.

438
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,918
Reason.

439
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,959
Something very smart,

440
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:16,250
and natural reason to see her again.

441
00:35:21,334 --> 00:35:23,959
A discount coupon for just-baked tasty bread ?

442
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:26,876
That's it!

443
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,000
Well...Is Nishimiya-san here?

444
00:35:29,584 --> 00:35:30,709
No, she isn't

445
00:35:31,626 --> 00:35:32,667
She is, isn't she?

446
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:34,501
No, she isn't

447
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,626
Shoko Nishimiya isn't here.

448
00:35:38,501 --> 00:35:39,709
Sorry but,

449
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,876
are you really a friend of Shoko?

450
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:45,167
Bye.

451
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:53,292
Nothing.

452
00:35:54,709 --> 00:35:56,876
I found a rat.

453
00:35:57,042 --> 00:35:59,167
A big creepy one.

454
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:04,626
Don't be afraid.  It won't come again.

455
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:14,083
Friend...

456
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:26,667
Huh?

457
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:30,876
Why...is he here?

458
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:33,792
O--Oh, he is!

459
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:35,667
Ishida-kun!

460
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,876
Look! Look!

461
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,542
A bike!  It's yours, isn't it?

462
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:44,042
Good timing!

463
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:48,167
Huh, it was so lucky that your address was written on the bike.

464
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:51,709
Wh...where was the bike?

465
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,626
It was abandoned in a rice paddy!

466
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,292
I looked for this all over the time!

467
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:59,876
I'm glad I got it back to you!

468
00:37:07,209 --> 00:37:08,626
Is something wrong, Ishida-kun?

469
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,667
H-hey

470
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,918
Well..

471
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,334
Your name?

472
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:15,792
Oops!  I'm Nagatsuka!

473
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:18,250
I sit just behind you in the class.

474
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:19,876
Oh, I see.

475
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,542
Don't you eat some bread?

476
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:24,959
This is so good, Nagatsuka-kun.

477
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:27,209
Ishida-kun.

478
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:29,083
Ishida-kun!

479
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:32,542
Good morning!

480
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,083
H..Hi, good morning!

481
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:37,501
Ishida-kun!

482
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:40,167
Why don't we hang out after school?

483
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:42,667
As we are friends now.

484
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:45,667
Ishida-kun, come here, come here!

485
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,834
What's wrong with you, Ya-sho?

486
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:12,125
Well.

487
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,459
Nothing.

488
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:14,918
Ya... "Ya-sho"?

489
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,918
Sounds like a "big friend", doesn't it?

490
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:21,959
Anyway, what are you worrying about?

491
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:25,876
You can tell anything, cause we are real friends.

492
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:32,459
Nagatsuka-kun.

493
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:36,000
What is the definition of "friends"?

494
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:37,918
A kind of license,

495
00:38:38,042 --> 00:38:40,167
or right or something like that,

496
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,542
to become friends with someone.

497
00:38:44,459 --> 00:38:46,125
Hey, Ya-sho.

498
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:50,751
Give me your hand.

499
00:38:56,107 --> 00:38:57,107
Hey, hey.

500
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:06,501
This is friendship.

501
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:08,959
I think, Ishida-kun,

502
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:14,209
friendship exists beyond such words and logic.

503
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:17,501
License? No such things are needed.

504
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,209
It's a ridiculous idea.

505
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:22,709
She is not here.

506
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:24,501
She is, isn't she?

507
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:25,751
She isn't

508
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:28,626
Huh, who are you anyway?

509
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:31,125
I'm Shoko's boyfriend.

510
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:34,959
Oops! ... Dropped.

511
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,751
Haha, that not about me, but a bread.

512
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,959
O...oh, really?

513
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,542
Nishimiya likes younger guys.

514
00:39:42,626 --> 00:39:45,459
I'm a little surprised that.

515
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:47,542
Ok, then how about giving this bread to her at least?

516
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:48,417
This is a very good bread.

517
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:49,542
Hey.

518
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:54,125
Don't be here again, if you only want to satisfy yourself.

519
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,083
Are you satisfied?

520
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Then bye.

521
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:03,417
Hey boy!

522
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:06,334
My friend wants to see Nishimiya-san!

523
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:09,584
Stop complaining and bring her here right now!

524
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:11,918
Nagatsuka-kun, why are you here?

525
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:13,834
I followed you.

526
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:15,709
Sounds like a behavior of best friends?

527
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:19,375
Haha, so the friend of a turd had a turd hair.

528
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,083
Hey, you a turd-hair!

529
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,209
Wh---what are you saying?!

530
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,751
Say that again boy!

531
00:40:27,876 --> 00:40:30,042
Turd-hair, turd-hair, turd-hair!

532
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:32,709
What's happening?

533
00:40:32,834 --> 00:40:33,918
Is that Yuzuru-chan?

534
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,417
Oh, no.  They are fighting.

535
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:36,125
You, small boy!

536
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,459
Nagatsuka-kun

537
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:40,167
Stop it, ok?

538
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:42,834
This is enough, so let's go home.

539
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,334
Nagatsuka-ku...

540
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:48,125
Oh?  Aren't you the boy from the other day?

541
00:40:48,584 --> 00:40:51,167
I--it's not like that!

542
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:52,626
Nagatsuka-kun, sorry for leaving you!

543
00:40:58,542 --> 00:40:59,751
Crap!

544
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,042
Crap, she found and met him.

545
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:03,709
Good for you, Ishida-kun!

546
00:41:05,918 --> 00:41:07,334
Hey boy.

547
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:09,000
You are peeping now, aren't you?

548
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:11,667
Let me use it now!

549
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:13,501
What?

550
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:16,459
Ishida-kun is waving his hands and doing something!?

551
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:17,959
It would be sign language.

552
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,125
Really!?

553
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:23,292
Wow, I didn't know he has such a skill.

554
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:25,676
Hey, you can read their sign language.

555
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:26,679
Then translate it for me!

556
00:41:28,876 --> 00:41:31,834
Who was that turd-hair just now?

557
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,209
I don't know such turd.

558
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:37,626
Oops, he was so creepy!

559
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:39,918
S-T-O-P J-O-K-I-N-G!

560
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,667
Leave me alone!

561
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:43,834
Tsk!

562
00:41:44,042 --> 00:41:46,125
Be careful not to fall, boy.

563
00:41:46,626 --> 00:41:48,292
"Honestly,"

564
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:51,876
"I was not sure if it was ok for me to see you again."

565
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:54,918
"A kind of license to be friends with you"

566
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:59,542
"I have been looking for all while, this 2 weeks."

567
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:02,083
"Reason to"

568
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:05,542
"See you again"

569
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:09,417
"I have been looking for it."

570
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:13,083
Ishida-kun...

571
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:14,417
Huh?

572
00:42:14,584 --> 00:42:16,125
"I'm glad."

573
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:19,417
"I thought"

574
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:20,792
"the same thing as you."

575
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:23,292
"That is so strange."

576
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,667
Well..

577
00:42:26,834 --> 00:42:29,584
Nishimiya, here it is. a bread.

578
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:30,792
To feed carp.

579
00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:38,876
Feeding is fun?

580
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:41,918
Oh, I was just reminded.

581
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:47,709
Huh?

582
00:42:57,907 --> 00:42:58,907
Well...

583
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:02,292
Nishimiya...

584
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,209
Y..you had better not read it

585
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:05,417
so much!

586
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:17,042
Hey!  wait, Nishimiya!

587
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,459
Oh!  She fell!

588
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:24,709
What!?  Something happened to Ishida-kun!?

589
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:25,459
Hey!

590
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:26,876
Hey, boy!

591
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:29,626
Oops!  Ishida-kun fell to the river!

592
00:43:29,751 --> 00:43:30,751
Why!?

593
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,834
Ouch!

594
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:33,167
Why you do so!

595
00:43:46,751 --> 00:43:48,250
Oops, what is this creepy thing!?

596
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,209
Nishimiya.

597
00:43:58,876 --> 00:44:00,083
Nishimiya!

598
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:05,167
Sorry for dropping the notebook.

599
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:16,918
See you.

600
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:34,167
Shoko, you so stupid...

601
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,501
Haha..

602
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:50,751
Stupid!

603
00:44:50,876 --> 00:44:52,459
Did you see this?

604
00:44:52,584 --> 00:44:54,918
Hey, isn't this guy Ishida-kun?

605
00:44:56,584 --> 00:44:58,042
"See you again"

606
00:44:59,417 --> 00:45:00,417
Can I?

607
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:05,209
Hey.

608
00:45:05,918 --> 00:45:07,667
This is Ishida-kun, isn't it?

609
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:09,167
This guy.

610
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:10,501
What?

611
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:12,334
What's this.

612
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:20,918
Ishida-kun, come to teachers' room right now.

613
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,584
"Notice of short-term suspension from school - Shoya Ishida"

614
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:26,334
"I am very sorry that I jumped into Suimon River from a bridge,

615
00:45:26,459 --> 00:45:29,000
where it was prohibited to do so, and..

616
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:31,334
I also uploaded that photo to the web.. "

617
00:45:31,459 --> 00:45:32,959
Hey, Shoya.

618
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:34,083
What?

619
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:38,292
Sorry but could you pick Maria back from the nursery?

620
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:41,042
I'm in school suspension term and prohibited to go out.

621
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:44,250
It would be ok if you do it quickly.  Please!!

622
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,584
H..hey!!

623
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:05,792
Maria, let's go home now!

624
00:46:05,918 --> 00:46:07,083
Sho-tan!

625
00:46:07,584 --> 00:46:09,542
Someone is there!

626
00:46:09,751 --> 00:46:11,125
Ouch!

627
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:16,873
Hey.

628
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:19,584
Hey, are you ok?

629
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:25,042
Aren't you Nishimiya's boyfriend?

630
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:26,375
You'll catch a cold.

631
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:30,375
Huh?  Oh, you a rat.

632
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:35,292
What are you doing here?

633
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:38,959
Shoes?

634
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:43,250
...Why don't you get angry with me?

635
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:44,959
What?

636
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,334
I am the person who uploaded the photo.

637
00:46:50,459 --> 00:46:52,459
Oh, you did it.

638
00:46:54,626 --> 00:46:55,959
I got it.

639
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:57,834
I am relieved to hear that.

640
00:46:58,292 --> 00:47:00,125
Why?

641
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:05,000
I would know the reason why.

642
00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:06,709
Be mad with me.

643
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:08,626
I cannot.

644
00:47:08,751 --> 00:47:11,459
Originally I am to be blamed.

645
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:13,167
Sho-tan!

646
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,292
I am hungry!

647
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:17,083
Ok!

648
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,125
Then I'll go home.

649
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,834
You go home, too.

650
00:47:21,459 --> 00:47:23,792
Haha, you have a kid.

651
00:47:23,918 --> 00:47:25,459
Ouch!

652
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:27,209
It's not mine, my sis's.

653
00:47:37,709 --> 00:47:38,417
Hey!

654
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:43,083
Hi Yuzuru-chan,

655
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:45,501
Please eat enough!

656
00:47:45,626 --> 00:47:46,626
How about sis?

657
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,918
She'll work late today.

658
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:52,167
Maria, isn't it too hot?

659
00:47:52,292 --> 00:47:54,209
No, it's good!

660
00:47:54,334 --> 00:47:56,751
Yuzuru-kun, why don't you eat?

661
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,250
Hi, Yuzuru-kun!

662
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:01,709
Please!

663
00:48:31,459 --> 00:48:32,834
Crap...

664
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:54,501
Huh?

665
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:57,292
What's the matter with you.

666
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:00,125
I was worried as you disappeared in the night.

667
00:49:01,959 --> 00:49:03,334
Hi, umbrella.

668
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:05,083
O--oh!

669
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:06,709
Anyway, use it!

670
00:49:06,834 --> 00:49:08,209
Well, please use it now.

671
00:49:09,751 --> 00:49:10,834
Thank you.

672
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:12,792
Well, excuse me.

673
00:49:12,918 --> 00:49:14,125
I knew that.

674
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:18,083
I'll give you these.

675
00:49:18,209 --> 00:49:19,626
This was mine, but

676
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:22,501
I won't use them anymore.  I'll give you.

677
00:49:24,876 --> 00:49:27,959
Why you ran away home?

678
00:49:29,709 --> 00:49:31,959
I had an argument with Shoko.

679
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:34,083
Oh..

680
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,167
That's a kind of typical event

681
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:39,501
for long-lasting couple, isn't it?

682
00:49:39,959 --> 00:49:41,042
Yes.

683
00:49:41,417 --> 00:49:43,959
like that I used Shoko's shampoo without her permission.

684
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:45,417
I see...

685
00:49:45,584 --> 00:49:47,709
I was said she doesn't need me.

686
00:49:49,918 --> 00:49:52,459
Hey, you live together with her!?

687
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:57,667
Use your umbrella for you.

688
00:49:57,792 --> 00:49:59,083
You have only one, don't you?

689
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:03,667
I am to be blamed as I brought only one umbrella.

690
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:07,792
I don't want Nishimiya's boyfriend get wet and sick.

691
00:50:10,209 --> 00:50:11,542
Hey you.

692
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:14,876
What kind of a man you intend to be?  A hypocrite?

693
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:15,834
What!?

694
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:18,501
You feel pleasure taking care of a poor stray cat?

695
00:50:18,709 --> 00:50:20,542
Or you make fun of doing it.

696
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:24,209
And you also made fun of her disability of hearing, I knew.

697
00:50:24,334 --> 00:50:25,375
Hey.

698
00:50:25,501 --> 00:50:28,501
Then, now you learned sign language huh?

699
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:29,709
What's this?

700
00:50:29,834 --> 00:50:32,209
Do you think you have changed to be a good person?

701
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:34,918
You are disgusting.

702
00:50:38,918 --> 00:50:40,167
I see.

703
00:50:40,626 --> 00:50:43,626
It's natural you know what I did, hearing from Nishimiya.

704
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:47,167
Yes.  You are right.

705
00:50:47,584 --> 00:50:49,667
I'm the worst human being.

706
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:52,918
I'm the one who don't worth living.

707
00:50:53,959 --> 00:50:55,209
But, at least,

708
00:50:56,042 --> 00:50:59,626
I thought I didn't want Nishimiya to cry again.

709
00:51:00,042 --> 00:51:03,918
Of course, I have no intention to interfere you two.

710
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:05,751
No intention. Never.

711
00:51:06,918 --> 00:51:08,584
But, actually,

712
00:51:08,751 --> 00:51:10,918
It's an issue of myself, too...

713
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:27,959
Thanks, it's enough here.

714
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:29,209
Ok.

715
00:51:31,459 --> 00:51:32,876
Well..

716
00:51:33,501 --> 00:51:37,000
I'm very sorry that you perfectly believe what I said..

717
00:51:37,417 --> 00:51:38,751
But actually I'm Shoko's...

718
00:51:40,459 --> 00:51:41,459
You understand?

719
00:51:48,459 --> 00:51:49,501
Oops!

720
00:51:49,626 --> 00:51:50,667
You are her little sis!?

721
00:51:50,792 --> 00:51:51,792
Bye!

722
00:51:59,834 --> 00:52:02,834
Oh, Nishimiya-san's mother...

723
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:08,792
Hey, let's go.

724
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:12,709
Hey, it pains.

725
00:52:14,417 --> 00:52:16,626
I'm very sorry...

726
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,125
I'm home.

727
00:52:22,417 --> 00:52:23,417
Yu-ju,

728
00:52:23,459 --> 00:52:24,834
Hey, sis!

729
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,959
I'b zorry, I'b zorry!

730
00:52:27,334 --> 00:52:29,417
All right, no problem.

731
00:52:29,834 --> 00:52:30,626
Hey.

732
00:52:30,751 --> 00:52:33,459
I wanna drink gramma's beefsteak plant juice.

733
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:35,375
Yuzuru.

734
00:52:35,709 --> 00:52:37,876
Don't be a friend with such a guy.

735
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,876
Say same thing to Shoko from you, too.

736
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:45,000
We can decide such a thing by ourselves.

737
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:46,918
Both I and sis.

738
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,292
Hey boy!

739
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,125
Nice to see you!

740
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,584
Why are you here today?

741
00:52:53,918 --> 00:52:55,834
To return his umbrella I lend the other day.

742
00:52:55,959 --> 00:52:56,959
Oh boy.

743
00:52:57,042 --> 00:52:59,167
You are doing a good thing.

744
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:01,834
Nagatsuka-kun, she is not a boy...

745
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:04,751
Little sis of Nishimiya.

746
00:53:06,209 --> 00:53:08,083
Of course, I knew it.

747
00:53:13,209 --> 00:53:16,083
I'm glad to see a friend of my best friend Ya-sho.

748
00:53:16,876 --> 00:53:18,083
He is my classmate,

749
00:53:18,209 --> 00:53:20,918
Na-ga-tsu-ka.

750
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,042
Hey, hey!

751
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:26,334
Well..

752
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:29,042
I got my new smartphone.

753
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:30,167
Well..

754
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,918
Do you have a smartphone too?

755
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:36,375
Then you enjoy texting?

756
00:53:36,626 --> 00:53:38,042
To whom?

757
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,709
Your classmates?

758
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:41,542
Oh, that's good.

759
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:44,792
Then do you have someone you want to add to text?

760
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:48,125
Someone you want to know address.

761
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:51,542
Great, then my address is...

762
00:53:52,167 --> 00:53:53,167
What?

763
00:53:53,792 --> 00:53:56,417
Sa...Ha...Ra.

764
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,876
Sahara-san?  a classmate of the elementary school?

765
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:11,292
Ya-sho, Ya-sho!

766
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:12,584
Then?

767
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:15,667
Are you going to look for Sahara-san?

768
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:19,125
Don't be joking.  I'm not such a girl.

769
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:22,667
But I really think Kawai-san is very clever.

770
00:54:23,083 --> 00:54:25,584
Kawai-san...

771
00:54:26,542 --> 00:54:27,542
Ya-sho?

772
00:54:27,709 --> 00:54:28,918
But Mashiba-kun is also..

773
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:30,375
Kawai-san...?

774
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,584
What?

775
00:54:32,751 --> 00:54:34,167
I..I have

776
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,709
something to ask to you.

777
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,501
Do you know phone number or something to contact

778
00:54:38,626 --> 00:54:41,334
of Sahara-san, our classmate of the elementary school?

779
00:54:41,834 --> 00:54:43,459
Sahara-san?

780
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:45,501
Sorry, I don't know...,

781
00:54:45,626 --> 00:54:48,167
But I know her school,

782
00:54:48,334 --> 00:54:50,042
as she belongs the same high school as Nao-chan.

783
00:54:50,501 --> 00:54:53,167
Taiyo female high school...

784
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:55,709
Oops, my money is not enough.

785
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:56,959
Ishida-kun.

786
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:58,626
Use this.

787
00:54:58,918 --> 00:55:01,667
What!?  I don't need that much!

788
00:55:01,792 --> 00:55:03,876
Don't mind, Ya-sho.

789
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,209
When you need travel, meal, and then love hotel expenses,

790
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:10,083
You will be safe to have that much.

791
00:55:10,209 --> 00:55:11,375
Hey!

792
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:13,501
We are here!

793
00:55:15,209 --> 00:55:16,542
My sis says

794
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:20,375
She pisses you as you are to look for a past classmate without her.

795
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:23,167
So take her with you, Ishida.

796
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Are you tired?

797
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,500
Thank you for today.

798
00:55:51,561 --> 00:55:59,805
I am happy to hear that you are trying to look for Sahara-san.

799
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I have heard various news about you from Yuzuru.

800
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,500
I'm pleased to go together today!

801
00:56:22,501 --> 00:56:25,209
Well...

802
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:27,834
Walking from here..

803
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:31,375
Sho-chan?

804
00:56:31,501 --> 00:56:33,167
Sorry.

805
00:56:33,292 --> 00:56:34,417
Sho-chan!

806
00:56:35,834 --> 00:56:38,667
I'm Sahara!

807
00:56:38,876 --> 00:56:40,459
Do you remember me?

808
00:56:41,209 --> 00:56:42,918
Hello!

809
00:56:43,042 --> 00:56:45,125
Huh?  Ishida-kun?

810
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:47,417
Hehehe.

811
00:56:48,167 --> 00:56:50,159
Long time no see.

812
00:56:55,042 --> 00:56:58,584
I continued to study sign language after that.

813
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,667
Is this correct?

814
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:04,250
Disappearing from you when in elementary school

815
00:57:06,918 --> 00:57:08,083
I'm sorry.

816
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:12,334
I have been thinking of Sho-chan for long time.

817
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:15,667
I'm happy to see you again.

818
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,334
And surprised.

819
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:24,083
Hum, hum...

820
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:25,334
Oh, really?

821
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Huh, and now,

822
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:33,292
What kind of school you are going to?

823
00:57:35,334 --> 00:57:36,334
I see.

824
00:57:36,459 --> 00:57:38,667
And, hey, your chest got big, you know.

825
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:39,792
What you cup size?

826
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:41,125
I'll check for myself!

827
00:57:45,459 --> 00:57:47,834
Where are you going?

828
00:57:47,959 --> 00:57:50,584
A restroom.

829
00:57:50,751 --> 00:57:52,542
I see.

830
00:57:56,167 --> 00:58:00,000
Hello!  We handing out a discount coupon for you!

831
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:02,417
Discount coupon!

832
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:12,209
Ueno..

833
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:13,959
Discount coupon!

834
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:16,250
Here it is.

835
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:25,417
Mew mew club...

836
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
From: Sahara-san

837
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
You are great that you leaned sign language.

838
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,626
And thank you for bringing us together!
You are great that you leaned sign language.

839
00:58:31,626 --> 00:58:33,000
And thank you for bringing us together!

840
00:58:37,334 --> 00:58:38,709
Oh!

841
00:58:38,834 --> 00:58:41,042
Sahara is so aggressive.

842
00:58:41,959 --> 00:58:43,751
I cannot behave like her...

843
00:58:44,209 --> 00:58:45,375
Hum?

844
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:48,584
Can I bring Ueno together, too?

845
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:52,042
Huh?  Naturally impossible, you know?

846
00:58:52,167 --> 00:58:53,751
Yeah, I know, I know.

847
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:56,125
I think so, too.

848
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:02,626
Yes.

849
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:04,542
Let's go, Nagatsuka-kun.

850
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,876
Now is the time to "Mew mew club"!

851
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:09,417
Can I help you?

852
00:59:09,959 --> 00:59:11,542
How long are you going to stay?

853
00:59:11,918 --> 00:59:13,375
One hour, please.

854
00:59:14,292 --> 00:59:16,417
Can we use this coupon?

855
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:19,000
Yes, you can.

856
00:59:19,292 --> 00:59:21,918
Oh, unbelievable.  He actually comes...

857
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:24,918
Well, what should I say, but...

858
00:59:26,918 --> 00:59:29,292
What in the world did you expect?

859
00:59:29,417 --> 00:59:31,125
So did you.

860
00:59:31,292 --> 00:59:33,417
No no.  Don't be stupid.

861
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:37,083
I was simply interested in your old friend.

862
00:59:37,209 --> 00:59:39,292
Yes, your friend.

863
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:41,083
Is she here?

864
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:43,751
Actually, not a friend.

865
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:45,375
Then what?

866
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:47,918
A little complicated.

867
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:50,417
There were something in the elementary school time.

868
00:59:53,542 --> 00:59:54,834
She seems not here today.

869
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:00,751
Let's go home then.

870
01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:11,292
Oh, really..

871
01:00:15,334 --> 01:00:16,334
Insect!

872
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:18,792
Hi, you come here.

873
01:00:19,501 --> 01:00:21,626
Came to play with Maria.

874
01:00:22,042 --> 01:00:24,959
By the way, will Nishimiya be pleased if I give this pouch?

875
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:26,209
Huh?

876
01:00:27,334 --> 01:00:28,626
A cat!

877
01:00:30,542 --> 01:00:32,125
Sis, I've got something for you!

878
01:00:47,501 --> 01:00:48,959
...Sis?

879
01:00:52,709 --> 01:00:54,667
I'll put some present for you here.

880
01:01:02,209 --> 01:01:03,209
What?

881
01:01:03,959 --> 01:01:04,959
U--Ueno..

882
01:01:05,042 --> 01:01:06,959
-san?

883
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:08,209
Go, go!

884
01:01:08,459 --> 01:01:10,542
Wait, wait, what is it!?

885
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,667
Long time no see!

886
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:14,417
Yeah.  Long time no see.

887
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:18,751
Huh?

888
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:22,250
The girl over there is Nishimiya, isn't she?

889
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:25,417
She seems still alone, haha.

890
01:01:25,959 --> 01:01:27,584
Too poor!

891
01:01:28,834 --> 01:01:31,292
Ishida!  It's really a long time not seeing you.

892
01:01:31,417 --> 01:01:32,918
Let's hang out together shortly.

893
01:01:33,042 --> 01:01:35,042
No thank you.

894
01:01:35,167 --> 01:01:37,709
Ishida, you hate me, don't you?

895
01:01:37,834 --> 01:01:40,584
I don't know.

896
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:43,501
Actually,

897
01:01:43,626 --> 01:01:46,459
I have been thinking

898
01:01:46,584 --> 01:01:48,250
I should have talk earlier.

899
01:01:48,751 --> 01:01:51,375
I'm sorry when we were in the elementary school.

900
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:55,876
Ueno, get off my bike.

901
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:04,709
Why she has a pouch of the cat cafe I'm working in?

902
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:07,542
Why? So weird!

903
01:02:08,042 --> 01:02:09,542
I gave it to her.

904
01:02:09,667 --> 01:02:11,751
Oh...I see.

905
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:17,584
Good-bye.

906
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:18,918
Bye.

907
01:02:23,167 --> 01:02:24,167
Ueno?

908
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:28,584
Nishimiya-san, long time no see!  Are you all right?

909
01:02:28,709 --> 01:02:29,709
H..hey!!

910
01:02:30,209 --> 01:02:32,083
Huh?  Why you wear only one?

911
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:34,417
Ueno!  What are you doing!?

912
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:38,959
Throwing away to play, as we did in the past.

913
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:46,918
Sorry, Nishimiya.

914
01:02:48,959 --> 01:02:51,959
Are you joking, Ishida?

915
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:53,959
Wait!  Let us wait a moment!

916
01:02:54,083 --> 01:02:56,667
You two are going together?

917
01:02:57,167 --> 01:02:58,959
No, not like that.

918
01:02:59,083 --> 01:03:00,626
Just a friend.

919
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:02,167
Friend?

920
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:03,876
Don't make me laugh!

921
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,918
You are friends with a girl who you bullied?

922
01:03:06,042 --> 01:03:07,292
Why?

923
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:10,292
I cannot follow you!

924
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,918
Oh, understand.  A kind of sense of guilt?

925
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,375
No.

926
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:17,834
Haha.

927
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:20,918
Ishida, you have became a so boring guy.

928
01:03:23,918 --> 01:03:27,667
Now I don't stop you two playing friends!

929
01:03:28,083 --> 01:03:30,626
Hahaha.

930
01:03:31,709 --> 01:03:32,709
Huh?

931
01:03:35,042 --> 01:03:36,667
"What were you two talking"?

932
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:38,375
N--Nothing special.

933
01:03:39,584 --> 01:03:42,167
Well, I have to go now.

934
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:44,375
See you again.

935
01:04:06,167 --> 01:04:07,417
Yuju,

936
01:04:09,751 --> 01:04:10,834
I'z mornigg.

937
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:13,334
I'm quite awake.  So surprised.

938
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:14,959
Bregbazt, lez eed now.

939
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:17,000
Wait, wait, before that..

940
01:04:17,501 --> 01:04:18,626
What's happened?

941
01:04:20,667 --> 01:04:22,083
Sis.

942
01:04:22,834 --> 01:04:25,501
Ponytail today?  Why?

943
01:04:25,626 --> 01:04:26,626
Oh.

944
01:04:27,209 --> 01:04:29,584
What a weird face!

945
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,918
Then make Ishida have a chance to see her!

946
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,626
So many carp.  Feeding manpower and bread shorted.

947
01:04:39,649 --> 01:04:41,049
You MUST come.

948
01:04:48,459 --> 01:04:49,459
Huh?

949
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:52,250
Nishimiya..

950
01:04:52,876 --> 01:04:54,459
Ponytail!?

951
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:11,709
Whea are yu goig, Ijida-gun?

952
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:14,667
"Where are you going?"

953
01:05:16,334 --> 01:05:17,667
I'm going to a bread shop.

954
01:05:18,042 --> 01:05:20,626
Yuzuru asked to buy a bread for feeding carp.

955
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:24,792
Yuju muzt habe id.  Yuju only wand do ead bi herzelb.

956
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,417

01:05:26,542 --> 01:05:28,459
Ijida-gun, don'd need do go

958
01:05:28,626 --> 01:05:29,626
Wait, wait.  Sign language!  Sign language!

01:05:31,667 --> 01:05:34,417

Yes.

961
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:39,375
Oh, sorry.

962
01:05:39,501 --> 01:05:41,209
Oh...

963
01:05:41,626 --> 01:05:44,292
it's completely ok.

964
01:05:44,584 --> 01:05:47,626
W--well, I have to go now. Bread.

965
01:05:48,667 --> 01:05:50,000
Then bye.

966
01:05:54,626 --> 01:05:55,667
Oh?

967
01:05:56,334 --> 01:05:57,334
Nishimiya?

968
01:06:05,751 --> 01:06:08,000
Huh? You give this?

969
01:06:08,501 --> 01:06:09,626
Thanks.

970
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:13,667
Can I open it here?

971
01:06:16,292 --> 01:06:17,792
...What are these?

972
01:06:21,626 --> 01:06:22,834
...Thank you very much.

973
01:06:27,334 --> 01:06:28,751
...ige...oo...

974
01:06:29,501 --> 01:06:30,501
What?

975
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,375
About this?

976
01:06:34,209 --> 01:06:36,209
I...ige...moo...

977
01:06:42,209 --> 01:06:43,042
Huh?...

978
01:06:46,876 --> 01:06:49,167
I lige moo!

979
01:06:58,292 --> 01:06:59,626
Moon?

980
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:01,417
Agree.

981
01:07:02,667 --> 01:07:03,876
It's beautiful.

982
01:07:09,918 --> 01:07:11,459
Ni..Nishimiya!?

983
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
(From: Big friend Nagatsuka)

984
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,999
How about go out and see a movie from now?

985
01:07:20,292 --> 01:07:21,542
Hey Nagatsuka-kun,

986
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:23,834
Can you see this as a moon?

987
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Huh?  I cannot see this as a moon.

988
01:07:27,459 --> 01:07:28,751
Hummm.

989
01:07:28,959 --> 01:07:29,834
C--Candy?

990
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:32,000
It is not candies.

991
01:07:32,584 --> 01:07:35,375
Nishimiya gave them just now,

992
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:37,209
but I'm not sure what are these.

993
01:07:37,626 --> 01:07:39,375
Huh?

994
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:42,083
Oh..

995
01:07:43,751 --> 01:07:45,292
What's the matter, sis?

996
01:07:48,209 --> 01:07:49,600
"I said I like you to Ishida-kun"

997
01:07:49,626 --> 01:07:50,876
Oh, really!?

998
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,400
But he didn't understand what I said.

999
01:07:55,626 --> 01:07:56,626
Huh...

1000
01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:05,334
Wow, you have changed your hairstyle.

1001
01:08:05,459 --> 01:08:08,042
Why changed?  What happened?

1002
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,417
It matches you so much!

1003
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:15,167
Stop, stop you all.

1004
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:17,959
I was in a bit of rush this morning, that's all.

1005
01:08:18,209 --> 01:08:20,751
But that looks great anyway.

1006
01:08:20,876 --> 01:08:22,667
Hi, Kawai-san.

1007
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:24,918
Why you have changed your hairstyle?

1008
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,626
Hummm.

1009
01:08:27,876 --> 01:08:30,334
I don't have any special reason to do it.

1010
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:31,667
I see.

1011
01:08:31,751 --> 01:08:34,584
That's what girls do, you know?

1012
01:08:34,959 --> 01:08:35,959
Ok.

1013
01:08:36,834 --> 01:08:38,334
What?

1014
01:08:38,459 --> 01:08:40,501
By the way, Mashiba-kun

1015
01:08:40,626 --> 01:08:43,876
said he wants to be friends with you.

1016
01:08:44,459 --> 01:08:45,667
Huh?

1017
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:54,667
Why...why you are here today.

1018
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:57,250
I'm Sahara, nice to meet you.

1019
01:08:57,417 --> 01:08:58,959
Me too.  I'm Mashiba.

1020
01:08:59,083 --> 01:09:01,542
Hey!  Stop doing that over my head!

1021
01:09:01,667 --> 01:09:03,959
Miyo-chan, long time no see.

1022
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:06,125
By the way, where is Nishimiya today?

1023
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,876
Sis went home as she had a stomachache.

1024
01:09:08,334 --> 01:09:09,167
Umm..

1025
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:11,751
I wonder she may be avoiding me...?

1026
01:09:11,959 --> 01:09:12,959
Why do you think so?

1027
01:09:13,125 --> 01:09:14,209
The other day,

1028
01:09:14,334 --> 01:09:16,334
She was trying hard to tell me something,

1029
01:09:16,459 --> 01:09:18,209
but I couldn't understand what she said.

1030
01:09:18,334 --> 01:09:20,167
Huh, what did sis tried to tell?

1031
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:21,709
Moon

1032
01:09:21,918 --> 01:09:22,584
Pff!

1033
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:26,125
I couldn't understand very simple words she told.

1034
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,792
I guess that would make her mad.

1035
01:09:28,918 --> 01:09:31,250
If you want to know if sis is avoiding you or not,

1036
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:32,959
why don't you invite her playing something?

1037
01:09:33,459 --> 01:09:34,792
If she is still angry, she will say "no".

1038
01:09:34,918 --> 01:09:35,918
Oh,

1039
01:09:36,292 --> 01:09:37,792
That's good idea.

1040
01:09:41,417 --> 01:09:42,717
(From: Ishida)  We plan to go to an amusement park,

1041
01:09:42,717 --> 01:09:44,717
and how about going together if you prefer?

1042
01:09:59,626 --> 01:10:01,918
Hi all, let's start with that roller coaster!

1043
01:10:02,042 --> 01:10:03,584
Follow me so that you don't lost!

1044
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:06,083
Hey, why is that girl leading us?

1045
01:10:06,209 --> 01:10:07,334
I don't know.

1046
01:10:07,584 --> 01:10:09,292
Ishida.

1047
01:10:09,584 --> 01:10:11,000
Who's that girl?

1048
01:10:11,417 --> 01:10:12,167
Oh!

1049
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:14,667
She seems too familiar with sis.

1050
01:10:15,292 --> 01:10:17,334
Ueno.. Why..

1051
01:10:18,876 --> 01:10:20,501
Is she Shoko's friend?

1052
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:22,250
Y--yes.

1053
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:24,125
When we were in the elementary school.

1054
01:10:24,501 --> 01:10:26,083
Hmmmm...

1055
01:10:30,709 --> 01:10:32,209
Can I sit next to you, Sahara-san?

1056
01:10:32,584 --> 01:10:33,709
Yeah, of course.

1057
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:40,459
Are you all ready?

1058
01:10:40,751 --> 01:10:41,918
Yeah!!

1059
01:10:42,334 --> 01:10:43,876
Then let's start.

1060
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:49,918
Sahara-san are you ok to be with Ueno?

1061
01:10:50,042 --> 01:10:51,042
Huh?

1062
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:52,083
Yes.

1063
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:54,859
I'm in the same class of the same high school with her now.

1064
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:59,042
I'm learning a lot from her taste and skill for clothes.

1065
01:11:01,042 --> 01:11:05,134
I had been scared to ride when in the elementary school.

1066
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:06,792
I was a coward at that time.

1067
01:11:09,334 --> 01:11:12,292
But I changed my way a bit.

1068
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:17,292
I decide to ride before I decide if it is scared or not.

1069
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,000
Actually, I am still scared a bit.

1070
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:25,000
Hey, it comes!

1071
01:11:45,584 --> 01:11:47,626
Hey, are you ok?

1072
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:49,959
Your legs are so trembling, Sho-chan.

1073
01:11:51,751 --> 01:11:53,667
"Are you ok?"

1074
01:11:54,792 --> 01:11:55,834
Haha.

1075
01:11:55,959 --> 01:11:58,876
You are fantastic as you can use sign language!

1076
01:11:59,167 --> 01:12:01,667
You did your best to learn sign language, Ishida-kun!

1077
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:03,250
Huh?

1078
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,709
Hey, is this hand yours?

1079
01:12:09,209 --> 01:12:11,083
You are so rude to my best friend Ya-sho!

1080
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:13,626
Huh?  I simply want to be friends with him.

1081
01:12:13,751 --> 01:12:15,417
No, don't act like a child!

1082
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:17,792
Nagatsuka-kun is so funny!

1083
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:21,000
My permission is needed when you speak to Ya-sho!

1084
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:23,501
Nagatsuka-kun, is your hair natural one?

1085
01:12:23,626 --> 01:12:26,042
What!?  Don't be silly!

1086
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:28,250
Hey! Stop touching my hair!

1087
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:29,375
Wait..

1088
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Mashiba-kun, go away faster!

1089
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:34,209
Go, go, Ya-sho, go!

1090
01:12:34,542 --> 01:12:35,375
Wait..

1091
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,375
Can I...?

1092
01:12:38,501 --> 01:12:40,876
Can I enjoy like this?

1093
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:44,792
But it seems like that..

1094
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,709
Oops!

1095
01:12:45,834 --> 01:12:47,501
What are you doing?!

1096
01:12:47,792 --> 01:12:50,501
It seems like..

1097
01:12:50,918 --> 01:12:52,417
Friends!

1098
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,876
Ishida.

1099
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:02,375
I want to eat "takoyaki" ball snacks.

1100
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:04,000
Let go to buy together.

1101
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:06,209
What!? Hey!

1102
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,125
Here's takoyaki.  Thank you for buying.

1103
01:13:10,876 --> 01:13:11,876
Thank you very much.

1104
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,209
Hey you, Ueno,

1105
01:13:13,626 --> 01:13:15,876
I don't want such unnecessary kindness.

1106
01:13:24,042 --> 01:13:26,501
Shi...Shimada...

1107
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:31,250
Hey!

1108
01:13:31,792 --> 01:13:33,792
Hey, Ishida!

1109
01:13:34,292 --> 01:13:35,334
Oh!

1110
01:13:36,167 --> 01:13:38,000
Sorry, but I'll text you later.

1111
01:13:39,959 --> 01:13:41,125
Ishida!

1112
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,167
You got angry?

1113
01:13:43,417 --> 01:13:44,542
No. I'm not angry.

1114
01:13:45,459 --> 01:13:47,375
Angry -- No.

1115
01:13:47,501 --> 01:13:48,501
I just thought

1116
01:13:48,834 --> 01:13:50,709
if you two meet again,

1117
01:13:50,834 --> 01:13:53,959
you could be friends again.

1118
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:57,834
Things might go well if you two meet again.

1119
01:13:58,292 --> 01:14:00,292
Don't do such misplaced kindness.

1120
01:14:01,876 --> 01:14:03,000
Oops.

1121
01:14:04,292 --> 01:14:05,542
Oops.

1122
01:14:05,959 --> 01:14:08,542
I did the same things to them...

1123
01:14:13,334 --> 01:14:15,626
You and me are alike, huh?

1124
01:14:15,792 --> 01:14:16,792
No. we are not.

1125
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,459
We are alike.

1126
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:20,334
We are not.

1127
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:25,083
Well.

1128
01:14:25,209 --> 01:14:28,542
If Nishimiya-san hadn't come, we all would have been happy.

1129
01:14:30,317 --> 01:14:31,892
Don't jump to such a conclusion at your discretion.

1130
01:14:31,918 --> 01:14:33,542
But wasn't it correct?

1131
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:35,792
If she had not be there,

1132
01:14:35,918 --> 01:14:38,959
I would not have a quarrel with Sahara,

1133
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:42,600
and friendship between Ishida and Shimada would have not been broken.

1134
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:46,125
I want to go back to the time when Nishimiya-san came.

1135
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,709
As for things with Shimada,

1136
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:50,876
I simply did so intentionally.

1137
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:54,584
Ishida, you hate me?

1138
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:56,375
Perhaps yes.

1139
01:14:58,042 --> 01:15:00,375
Now I feel like to ride a ferris wheel.

1140
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:02,709
Want to ride with Nishimiya-san.

1141
01:15:02,834 --> 01:15:04,083
H--hey!

1142
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:05,417
Huh?

1143
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:08,542
Nishimiya-san, let's ride a ferris whee together.

1144
01:15:08,667 --> 01:15:10,083
Hey, Ueno!

1145
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:12,709
Sis, sorry but take this camera with you.

1146
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,501
I'm going to ride the jet coaster again.

1147
01:15:38,542 --> 01:15:41,000
Hi, you are welcome, Yuzuru-chan.

1148
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:42,876
Shoya is in his room.

1149
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:45,167
Hi.

1150
01:15:45,292 --> 01:15:47,042
I got a highly confidential movie.

1151
01:15:48,417 --> 01:15:49,792
Movie in the ferris wheel?

1152
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:51,292
Yes.

1153
01:15:51,542 --> 01:15:53,334
Huh?  What do you mean?

1154
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:55,209
Peepingcam.

1155
01:16:00,167 --> 01:16:02,042
Well, I...

1156
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:04,125
I hate you.

1157
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:09,959
Let's not use it.

1158
01:16:11,125 --> 01:16:13,792
I'll speak clearly so that you can understand

1159
01:16:13,918 --> 01:16:16,792
and I'll listen what you say.

1160
01:16:18,042 --> 01:16:20,125
In elementary school days,

1161
01:16:20,584 --> 01:16:24,250
I didn't understand you enough.

1162
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:29,042
But, I think you didn't understand us, too.

1163
01:16:29,626 --> 01:16:33,292
That's why you bothered me with weird notebook

1164
01:16:33,417 --> 01:16:35,751
and always smiled insincerely.

1165
01:16:35,876 --> 01:16:39,250
You always said sorry when something happened.

1166
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:43,250
So I changed the way.

1167
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:47,125
I ignored you and talked about you behind your back.

1168
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:51,250
These were my message not to interfere us any more.

1169
01:16:51,667 --> 01:16:52,751
But,

1170
01:16:52,876 --> 01:16:56,250
you didn't understand and got us back.

1171
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:58,459
By ratting on us to adults.

1172
01:16:59,167 --> 01:17:02,167
As a result, Ishida lost his friends,

1173
01:17:02,667 --> 01:17:06,292
Lot of things around us were broken by you.

1174
01:17:08,709 --> 01:17:10,292
I...I'b zorry...

1175
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:13,709
Actually, I don't want you to apologize.

1176
01:17:13,918 --> 01:17:16,334
Our view was very narrow in the childhood,

1177
01:17:16,459 --> 01:17:19,876
and we did our best within that limitation.

1178
01:17:20,042 --> 01:17:24,626
But I don't wanna say you let's be friends now.

1179
01:17:24,918 --> 01:17:27,417
I still hate you, and

1180
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:29,501
You still hate me.

1181
01:17:30,209 --> 01:17:33,667
But how about being peaceful between you and me?

1182
01:17:33,876 --> 01:17:37,000
So let's shake hands, even both hate both.

1183
01:17:37,501 --> 01:17:40,000
Zat'z nod gorregd...

1184
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:43,667
I hade myzelf...

1185
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:46,334
So what?

1186
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:49,250
What's that?

1187
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,667
Then?

1188
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:57,459
You say "I'm sorry" again!?

1189
01:17:57,876 --> 01:17:59,125
After all,

1190
01:17:59,292 --> 01:18:02,918
you are shutting your mind to talk with me, as you did 5 years ago.

1191
01:18:09,792 --> 01:18:11,167
How do you think?

1192
01:18:17,167 --> 01:18:18,626
I want Nishimiya

1193
01:18:19,209 --> 01:18:22,042
to like Nishimiya herself.

1194
01:18:30,918 --> 01:18:32,834
Ueno--san, right?

1195
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,709
Yes. Ueno?

1196
01:18:35,334 --> 01:18:38,417
Did Nishimiya-san have a trouble with her?

1197
01:18:38,584 --> 01:18:40,250
Why do you think so?

1198
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:44,167
Kawai-san said there were something in the elementary school.

1199
01:18:45,501 --> 01:18:47,042
By the way, I was surprised

1200
01:18:47,167 --> 01:18:49,834
Nishimiya-san was really unable to hear.

1201
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:51,584
Yes, she is.

1202
01:18:51,709 --> 01:18:53,083
Oh, then, I guess,

1203
01:18:53,209 --> 01:18:56,167
she was bullied because of that?

1204
01:18:57,792 --> 01:19:00,167
I cannot forgive

1205
01:19:00,584 --> 01:19:01,709
that kind of bully,

1206
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:03,959
How do you think, Ishida-kun?

1207
01:19:04,751 --> 01:19:06,375
What do you mean!?

1208
01:19:06,834 --> 01:19:09,501
You say I am spreading what you did in the past!?

1209
01:19:09,626 --> 01:19:11,959
Hey, you speak too loud...

1210
01:19:14,042 --> 01:19:16,751
After all, Ishida-kun has not changed at all from the past!

1211
01:19:16,876 --> 01:19:17,542
What!?

1212
01:19:17,667 --> 01:19:19,751
You have always told me cruel things since elementary school!

1213
01:19:19,876 --> 01:19:21,042
What's the matter, Ya-sho?

1214
01:19:21,167 --> 01:19:22,792
Calm down, Kawai-san.

1215
01:19:23,209 --> 01:19:24,209
What are you talking about?

1216
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:26,834
Mashiba-kun!

1217
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,959
Ishida-kun used to bully a girl in the past.

1218
01:19:32,459 --> 01:19:34,667
What are you saying, Kawai-san?

1219
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:36,209
Don't be silly..

1220
01:19:36,334 --> 01:19:37,459
It is true.

1221
01:19:38,292 --> 01:19:41,459
Kawai-san also said bad things at that time...

1222
01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:45,083
I never said bad words to Nishimiya-san!

1223
01:19:45,209 --> 01:19:46,834
What!? Nishimiya-san!?

1224
01:19:46,959 --> 01:19:47,751
Yes.

1225
01:19:47,876 --> 01:19:50,709
Ishida-kun bullied Nishimiya-san.

1226
01:19:52,918 --> 01:19:56,334
I asked him please to stop doing that,

1227
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,834
but he never listened to what I said.

1228
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:01,959
He scared me so much..

1229
01:20:04,334 --> 01:20:05,083
Ya-sho?

1230
01:20:05,209 --> 01:20:06,000
Oops...

1231
01:20:06,125 --> 01:20:07,417
Are you ok?

1232
01:20:07,542 --> 01:20:09,334
Sorry, Nagatsuka-kun..

1233
01:20:09,459 --> 01:20:10,501
Ya-sho..

1234
01:20:12,584 --> 01:20:13,792
Ya-sho!

1235
01:20:42,459 --> 01:20:45,083
I hate myself, too...

1236
01:20:56,626 --> 01:20:58,375
Hi, Ishida.

1237
01:20:58,501 --> 01:20:59,209
Hi!

1238
01:21:01,459 --> 01:21:02,918
What's wrong?

1239
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,918
No, nothing special.

1240
01:21:06,167 --> 01:21:07,709
Nothing..

1241
01:21:07,876 --> 01:21:08,918
Huh?

1242
01:21:09,834 --> 01:21:11,501
Hey, Ishida-kun, you are here!

1243
01:21:11,918 --> 01:21:13,959
I'm bringing your bag here!

1244
01:21:14,209 --> 01:21:14,876
Hey.

1245
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:16,209
Nao-chan..

1246
01:21:17,209 --> 01:21:18,876
...I asked her to come.

1247
01:21:22,792 --> 01:21:24,584
I'm sorry in the classroom, Ishida-kun.

1248
01:21:25,417 --> 01:21:26,501
But,

1249
01:21:26,834 --> 01:21:30,042
originally you are to blamed, I think.

1250
01:21:30,959 --> 01:21:32,375
But,

1251
01:21:32,626 --> 01:21:34,709
if Ishida-kun apologize first,

1252
01:21:34,834 --> 01:21:36,542
we can forgive him,

1253
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:38,250
Mashiba-kun said so, and..

1254
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:39,584
Stop it.

1255
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:42,250
That's not proper way.

1256
01:21:42,417 --> 01:21:46,083
We have no right to blame him for this matter.

1257
01:21:47,417 --> 01:21:48,751
"We"?

1258
01:21:49,042 --> 01:21:50,501
That's not correct, Nao-chan.

1259
01:21:50,626 --> 01:21:51,792
What's not?

1260
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:53,375
Different from me,

1261
01:21:53,501 --> 01:21:57,167
Nao-chan actually bullied Nishimiya-san too.

1262
01:21:57,375 --> 01:21:59,667
You should not treat me like yourself.

1263
01:22:00,834 --> 01:22:02,501
Nao-chan..

1264
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:04,125
Hummm.

1265
01:22:04,626 --> 01:22:06,209
You're right.  We are different.

1266
01:22:06,667 --> 01:22:08,292
Completely different from you.

1267
01:22:08,417 --> 01:22:11,417
You were just looking on and laughed at her being bullied.

1268
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:13,125
Too bad!

1269
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:15,000
Hey, Sahara, how do you think about this?

1270
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:16,918
Me!?

1271
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:20,167
Nao-chan also said so many bad things to Sahara-san.

1272
01:22:20,292 --> 01:22:22,459
I just said true things!

1273
01:22:23,792 --> 01:22:26,292
Hey, answer now, Sahara!

1274
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,167
I..I was..

1275
01:22:29,626 --> 01:22:31,292
At that time..

1276
01:22:31,751 --> 01:22:33,501
I was scared to both of you.

1277
01:22:33,626 --> 01:22:35,667
What!?  Which side you are on!?

1278
01:22:35,834 --> 01:22:37,501
I'm not on any side of you two!

1279
01:22:37,626 --> 01:22:38,792
Stop all.

1280
01:22:40,501 --> 01:22:43,501
It's all my fault.

1281
01:22:45,167 --> 01:22:47,250
I hate that kind of logic.

1282
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:49,375
Stop, Ueno.

1283
01:22:50,209 --> 01:22:53,334
Don't conclude everything by yourself.

1284
01:22:54,417 --> 01:22:55,959
Ishida-kun, don't talk in such way...

1285
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:57,584
Stop, Sahara.

1286
01:22:57,709 --> 01:22:59,626
You will ran away after all like the past time and regret,

1287
01:22:59,751 --> 01:23:01,334
like "I was a coward".

1288
01:23:01,626 --> 01:23:03,334
What wrong with you, Ishida-kun?

1289
01:23:03,626 --> 01:23:06,083
Stop speaking, Kawai.

1290
01:23:06,542 --> 01:23:09,417
You simply like yourself the most.

1291
01:23:10,501 --> 01:23:11,501
Ya-sho,

1292
01:23:11,626 --> 01:23:14,042
I'm always on you side...

1293
01:23:14,334 --> 01:23:18,000
Don't say such a thing without knowing me enough.

1294
01:23:18,918 --> 01:23:21,125
That's enough!  I'm going home!

1295
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:23,584
Ya-sho..

1296
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:28,709
It's all right.  I don't mind at all.

1297
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:31,626
Sho-chan,

1298
01:23:32,626 --> 01:23:33,918
See you again.

1299
01:23:40,167 --> 01:23:41,834
Sorry, Ishida.

1300
01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:45,584
I regret to come here.

1301
01:23:48,501 --> 01:23:51,125
Ishida-kun, you were too bad.

1302
01:23:52,876 --> 01:23:55,250
Don't be in touch, you outsider.

1303
01:23:56,918 --> 01:23:59,042
I had thought we became friends.

1304
01:24:11,375 --> 01:24:12,542
Oh, by the way,

1305
01:24:13,751 --> 01:24:15,167
from next week,

1306
01:24:15,834 --> 01:24:17,542
a summer holidays will start.

1307
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:20,250
Why don't we go somewhere fun together?

1308
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:41,083
Yuzu.

1309
01:24:41,501 --> 01:24:44,918
You'll hurt your eyes seeing something in such a dark place.

1310
01:24:50,626 --> 01:24:51,792
Here.

1311
01:24:58,542 --> 01:25:02,000
Yuzu, you still worry about sis?

1312
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:07,751
Gramma worry about you, Yuzuru.

1313
01:25:07,918 --> 01:25:09,709
You always care about your sis,

1314
01:25:09,834 --> 01:25:13,667
and don't care about yourself.

1315
01:25:14,334 --> 01:25:16,125
You are doing the same thing, gramma?

1316
01:25:16,626 --> 01:25:20,834
You don't join senior people groups and study sign language all the time.

1317
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:24,667
That's just what I myself want to do.

1318
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:28,542
Then so do I.  I also do what I'm doing for myself.

1319
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,209
Really?

1320
01:25:34,709 --> 01:25:36,918
You are a very good granddaughter, Yuzu.

1321
01:25:37,209 --> 01:25:38,209
I don't think so.

1322
01:25:38,584 --> 01:25:41,334
I'm scolded everyday from mom,

1323
01:25:41,459 --> 01:25:43,334
and I have not gone to school for a while.

1324
01:25:43,918 --> 01:25:46,167
Yuzu have a very beautiful mind.

1325
01:25:47,125 --> 01:25:48,876
Shoko is also doing best everyday.

1326
01:25:51,292 --> 01:25:55,375
I'm very proud of having very good granddaughters.

1327
01:25:58,834 --> 01:26:00,667
How about a sweet manju?

1328
01:26:00,792 --> 01:26:01,876
Yes, of course!

1329
01:26:16,709 --> 01:26:17,709
Grandma...

1330
01:26:30,501 --> 01:26:32,375
Hi Nishimiya.

1331
01:26:32,834 --> 01:26:37,751
Today I got a very good bread.

1332
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,709
This bread is

1333
01:26:41,709 --> 01:26:44,792
as wonderful as you,

1334
01:26:44,918 --> 01:26:46,417
so..

1335
01:26:47,584 --> 01:26:49,042
Hummm, does this sound strange?

1336
01:26:49,792 --> 01:26:50,792
Huh...?

1337
01:26:52,709 --> 01:26:54,709
Nishimiya doesn't come today?

1338
01:26:57,626 --> 01:26:58,751
Well..

1339
01:26:59,292 --> 01:27:01,876
"Hi, Nishimiya, do you have a stomachache today too?"

1340
01:27:02,459 --> 01:27:03,667
Hummm, this message is not good.

1341
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:15,751
Hey, Yuzu...

1342
01:27:29,459 --> 01:27:30,459
I'll go home now...

1343
01:27:30,501 --> 01:27:31,542
Ishida.

1344
01:27:31,918 --> 01:27:33,125
Hey!

1345
01:27:33,876 --> 01:27:35,083
What is your outfit?

1346
01:27:35,209 --> 01:27:37,292
What?  This is my school uniform.

1347
01:27:37,417 --> 01:27:38,918
How you feel, how you feel?!

1348
01:27:39,042 --> 01:27:40,042
Why?

1349
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:42,459
School.

1350
01:27:42,751 --> 01:27:44,792
But it is in summer vacation now.

1351
01:27:44,918 --> 01:27:45,918
Uhh..

1352
01:27:47,417 --> 01:27:49,083
Actually, what's wrong with you?

1353
01:27:51,417 --> 01:27:52,959
Nothing.

1354
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:55,083
If I say something.. a kind of cosplay!?

1355
01:27:55,209 --> 01:27:57,292
Huh.

1356
01:27:58,709 --> 01:28:01,375
Text from my sis.  I have to go.

1357
01:28:01,501 --> 01:28:02,876
I'll take you.  Where?

1358
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,125
No thank you.

1359
01:28:04,501 --> 01:28:05,501
I will.

1360
01:28:05,626 --> 01:28:07,334
Actually don't wanna you do so.

1361
01:28:07,834 --> 01:28:09,417
You cried just now.

1362
01:28:10,417 --> 01:28:11,501
Why?

1363
01:28:13,709 --> 01:28:16,209
It's got nothing to do with you, Ishida.

1364
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:19,083
Yes it does..

1365
01:28:19,751 --> 01:28:21,083
I want to think it does.

1366
01:28:21,209 --> 01:28:22,459
Why?

1367
01:28:22,876 --> 01:28:24,375
I worry about Yuzuru.

1368
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:28,959
Don't say what my grandma would say.

1369
01:28:31,667 --> 01:28:33,542
Then I don't care if you follow me.

1370
01:28:37,209 --> 01:28:38,959
Thank you Ishida.

1371
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:42,125
It's enough here.

1372
01:28:42,802 --> 01:28:44,810
"Funeral site for Ito Nishimiya"

1373
01:28:44,834 --> 01:28:46,000
Bye.

1374
01:28:51,876 --> 01:28:53,751
Hold out, Yuzuru!

1375
01:28:57,042 --> 01:28:58,250
Ishida.

1376
01:29:02,209 --> 01:29:03,792
I found myself still scared a bit.

1377
01:30:03,626 --> 01:30:06,975
(To: Nishimiya) How about hanging out somewhere tomorrow?

1378
01:30:59,334 --> 01:31:01,125
Oh, it's splendid.

1379
01:31:03,876 --> 01:31:05,667
Com'on, Nishimiya.  Let's go far.

1380
01:31:08,501 --> 01:31:09,709
Huh?

1381
01:31:15,417 --> 01:31:16,667
Nishimiya?

1382
01:31:16,792 --> 01:31:17,792
Oops!

1383
01:31:24,209 --> 01:31:26,501
Haha.. I'm a bit scared.

1384
01:31:28,709 --> 01:31:30,501
What?  Why you say sorry now?

1385
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:39,000
Don't say such a ridiculous thing!

1386
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:40,792
Hey, Nishimiya, how about tomorrow?

1387
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:42,417
Let's hang out tomorrow, too!

1388
01:31:42,542 --> 01:31:44,459
Ok?  Nishimiya.

1389
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:49,501
Nishimiya said that

1390
01:31:49,626 --> 01:31:53,083
I will be unhappy as far as I am together with her.

1391
01:31:54,834 --> 01:31:57,292
The person who made Nishimiya unhappy

1392
01:31:57,792 --> 01:31:59,334
was I, actually..

1393
01:32:07,667 --> 01:32:12,125
I want to see ocean,

1394
01:32:13,042 --> 01:32:17,542
I want to love human,

1395
01:32:18,584 --> 01:32:22,292
even a monster has

1396
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:27,042
a heart..

1397
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:28,459
Sigh.

1398
01:32:28,667 --> 01:32:31,167
Cannot imagine how I can recover the relationship...

1399
01:32:35,542 --> 01:32:38,667
Nishimiya!  Today Yuzuru is here, too!

1400
01:32:38,834 --> 01:32:40,709
Then let's go to see a movie!

1401
01:32:40,834 --> 01:32:43,584
Hahaha, how funny it is!

1402
01:32:44,083 --> 01:32:46,083
Hey, I'm here today!

1403
01:32:46,542 --> 01:32:49,751
What a fruitful summer holidays this year!

1404
01:32:49,876 --> 01:32:50,876
You agree on that, Yuzuru?

1405
01:32:50,918 --> 01:32:51,751
I don't know..

1406
01:32:51,876 --> 01:32:54,459
It's really full of happiness.

1407
01:32:54,584 --> 01:32:55,709
Hey, Nishimiya,

1408
01:32:55,834 --> 01:32:57,459
How about tomorrow?

1409
01:32:57,584 --> 01:32:59,125
Let's go out somewhere tomorrow, too!

1410
01:32:59,375 --> 01:33:02,167
We cannot go tomorrow, as we have something to do.

1411
01:33:02,459 --> 01:33:03,459
What?

1412
01:33:04,876 --> 01:33:07,000
Really!?  Are you serious!?

1413
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:08,125
What are you going to make?

1414
01:33:08,334 --> 01:33:09,375
I---is that ok?

1415
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:11,876
Is it ok for me to be here?

1416
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Now that Ishida is assigned to help us

1417
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:16,667
to make a birthday cake for our mother.

1418
01:33:16,792 --> 01:33:17,792
Really?

1419
01:33:17,834 --> 01:33:19,417
I---is that ok?

1420
01:33:19,542 --> 01:33:21,250
Your mom will slap me again, won't she?

1421
01:33:21,375 --> 01:33:23,918
It might be even more.  She may kill you.

1422
01:33:24,042 --> 01:33:25,250
Hey!

1423
01:33:25,751 --> 01:33:28,000
Oh, it looks delicious!

1424
01:33:30,667 --> 01:33:33,042
What?  Why is this guy here?

1425
01:33:33,167 --> 01:33:35,167
Shoko, what do you intend to do?

1426
01:33:35,334 --> 01:33:37,417
Get out now..

1427
01:33:37,542 --> 01:33:40,209
Stop, mother!  Today is your celebration day!

1428
01:33:40,334 --> 01:33:41,501
Yuzuru.

1429
01:33:41,667 --> 01:33:42,751
You looks good with this!

1430
01:33:43,876 --> 01:33:44,876
Huh..

1431
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,375
Tastes good!

1432
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:54,459
It was good that you didn't get killed, Ishida.

1433
01:33:54,792 --> 01:33:55,918
Y--Yes.

1434
01:33:56,042 --> 01:33:57,792
Good job, sis!

1435
01:33:57,959 --> 01:33:59,667
By the way, Yuzuru.

1436
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,501
I submitted some of your photos to the prefectural photo contest.

1437
01:34:03,626 --> 01:34:05,083
What?

1438
01:34:05,209 --> 01:34:07,292
Sho-chan wanted to submit for you.

1439
01:34:10,876 --> 01:34:13,751
But I suppose all the photos are kind of creepy ones.

1440
01:34:13,876 --> 01:34:15,667
Not necessarily so.

1441
01:34:16,542 --> 01:34:18,125
Hey, you two did so without asking me!

1442
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:19,250
Pff..

1443
01:34:20,042 --> 01:34:23,959
By the way, there will be a fireworks festival next Tuesday.

1444
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:27,876
Humm, I'd like to pass.

1445
01:34:28,042 --> 01:34:29,876
Let's go together.

1446
01:34:42,584 --> 01:34:44,667
Is it ok here?  Yes, yes.

1447
01:35:13,626 --> 01:35:16,375
Well, I'll go to buy fried noodles.

1448
01:35:16,542 --> 01:35:17,709
Let's go together.

1449
01:35:29,834 --> 01:35:31,083
Oh thank you.

1450
01:35:31,501 --> 01:35:35,459
Well, thank you for inviting me to your house the other day.

1451
01:35:35,584 --> 01:35:36,626
Your mom..

1452
01:35:36,792 --> 01:35:37,792
Yes, yes.

1453
01:35:37,834 --> 01:35:39,834
Did she enjoy the party?

1454
01:35:39,959 --> 01:35:41,709
Basically she had no facial expressions, but..

1455
01:35:42,459 --> 01:35:46,042
What day is your birthday, Nishimiya?

1456
01:35:47,792 --> 01:35:48,876
June

1457
01:35:49,042 --> 01:35:50,042
7th.

1458
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:52,375
Oh, it is already passed!

1459
01:35:52,501 --> 01:35:53,501
Well..

1460
01:35:53,626 --> 01:35:56,334
You are 18 years old already.

1461
01:35:56,667 --> 01:36:00,584
Next year, let's celebrate your birthday together.

1462
01:36:00,709 --> 01:36:01,542
Oops,

1463
01:36:01,667 --> 01:36:03,334
I said "together" unintentionally.

1464
01:36:06,959 --> 01:36:07,959
Oh.

1465
01:36:26,584 --> 01:36:28,834
I see.

1466
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,292
Understood!

1467
01:36:30,667 --> 01:36:33,042
It's interesting.

1468
01:36:34,834 --> 01:36:37,000
Oh, what's up?

1469
01:36:40,918 --> 01:36:44,792
But fireworks are not over yet?

1470
01:36:47,417 --> 01:36:48,792
"Study"..

1471
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:50,959
I see.

1472
01:36:51,417 --> 01:36:53,792
Then I'll go with you.

1473
01:36:55,167 --> 01:36:56,501
But..

1474
01:37:02,542 --> 01:37:03,542
I see.

1475
01:37:03,667 --> 01:37:05,292
See you again.

1476
01:37:15,626 --> 01:37:18,584
What?  what happened to sis?

1477
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:20,918
Then, Ishida,

1478
01:37:21,042 --> 01:37:23,167
can you go to our apartment to pick up my camera?

1479
01:37:36,834 --> 01:37:39,042
Good evening..

1480
01:37:39,167 --> 01:37:40,459
Oh, it's dark.

1481
01:37:40,792 --> 01:37:43,876
Nishimiya, I'm here.

1482
01:37:44,542 --> 01:37:46,209
Here it is.

1483
01:37:46,584 --> 01:37:49,709
Is the charging ok..?

1484
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,250
Huh?  oh, we can see fireworks from here.

1485
01:37:53,792 --> 01:37:56,209
Found Nishimiya.

1486
01:37:56,375 --> 01:37:58,751
Hi, Nishimi..ya..

1487
01:37:59,751 --> 01:38:00,751
Nishimiya?

1488
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:03,167
Wait, wait!  Wait a moment!

1489
01:38:03,918 --> 01:38:04,918
What are you doing?!

1490
01:38:05,042 --> 01:38:06,042
Nishimiya?

1491
01:38:10,083 --> 01:38:11,083
Nishimiya..!?

1492
01:38:13,542 --> 01:38:14,542
Huh!

1493
01:38:23,042 --> 01:38:23,834
Nishimiya!

1494
01:38:23,959 --> 01:38:24,959
Ouch!

1495
01:38:30,792 --> 01:38:31,959
Nishimiya!

1496
01:38:34,417 --> 01:38:35,876
Shoko!

1497
01:38:59,792 --> 01:39:00,918
Why..

1498
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:02,792
Why, Nishimiya..

1499
01:39:07,834 --> 01:39:08,834
Nishimiya, frame!

1500
01:39:08,959 --> 01:39:10,959
Grip the frame!

1501
01:39:11,125 --> 01:39:12,584
Please, God..

1502
01:39:13,292 --> 01:39:17,042
Give me just one more ounce of strength.

1503
01:39:18,167 --> 01:39:20,834
I won't escape from my challenges of life.

1504
01:39:21,876 --> 01:39:23,167
From tomorrow,

1505
01:39:23,667 --> 01:39:26,501
I'll look at everyone's face.

1506
01:39:26,709 --> 01:39:30,459
I'll listen to everyone's voice from tomorrow.

1507
01:39:31,626 --> 01:39:34,626
I'll do everything properly from tomorrow...

1508
01:39:35,542 --> 01:39:37,626
Ni..Nishimiya..

1509
01:39:39,542 --> 01:39:42,626
Oh, a scar I made at that time...

1510
01:39:43,751 --> 01:39:46,209
Did I properly apologize for that?

1511
01:39:47,292 --> 01:39:48,375
Sorry.

1512
01:39:48,751 --> 01:39:50,792
Sorry, Nishimiya.

1513
01:39:51,042 --> 01:39:52,626
Are you still mad?

1514
01:39:53,042 --> 01:39:55,375
Crap...

1515
01:39:56,042 --> 01:39:57,334
I should have ask Nishimiya

1516
01:39:57,459 --> 01:40:00,834
how you really think of me...

1517
01:40:01,876 --> 01:40:05,000
By the way, you know, I---

1518
01:40:18,125 --> 01:40:19,209
Sho-chan,

1519
01:40:19,334 --> 01:40:22,250
Sis made pancakes for you.

1520
01:40:22,792 --> 01:40:24,876
Maria will go out to see fireworks!

1521
01:40:37,375 --> 01:40:38,834
It's cold..

1522
01:40:39,667 --> 01:40:41,250
and warm..

1523
01:41:07,209 --> 01:41:08,375
Hi, ma'am.

1524
01:41:08,918 --> 01:41:10,834
Hi, Yuzuru-chan...

1525
01:41:11,542 --> 01:41:12,918
I finally saw you.

1526
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:15,459
No one answered when I called to the salon,

1527
01:41:15,584 --> 01:41:17,626
and entering the room was prohibited...

1528
01:41:17,918 --> 01:41:20,626
Oh, that is ok now.

1529
01:41:20,792 --> 01:41:22,626
He changed rooms today.

1530
01:41:23,125 --> 01:41:26,250
Let's go to the room together, to see him.

1531
01:41:26,626 --> 01:41:28,209
Ma'am, well Shoko...

1532
01:41:28,334 --> 01:41:29,542
Ishida-san.

1533
01:41:30,375 --> 01:41:31,375
Nishimiya-san..

1534
01:41:33,167 --> 01:41:35,667
Nishimiya-san..I'm sorry.

1535
01:41:36,042 --> 01:41:39,250
Sorry again for troubling like this.

1536
01:41:40,334 --> 01:41:41,751
I am very sorry.

1537
01:41:41,876 --> 01:41:42,876
Oh, please stop it.

1538
01:41:43,542 --> 01:41:46,542
My son must have done something wrong to Shoko-san.

1539
01:41:46,667 --> 01:41:48,375
Ma'am.

1540
01:41:48,501 --> 01:41:51,959
Ishida saved my stupid sister.

1541
01:41:52,417 --> 01:41:54,667
I owe all the responsibility of mismanagement.

1542
01:41:55,292 --> 01:41:57,709
I'm sorry.

1543
01:41:59,667 --> 01:42:00,667
Please.

1544
01:42:01,876 --> 01:42:04,042
Please raise your heads.

1545
01:42:04,209 --> 01:42:06,876
Nothing is better than that Shoko-san is ok.  Isn't it?

1546
01:42:07,209 --> 01:42:09,459
So do you, Yuzuru-chan.

1547
01:42:10,417 --> 01:42:12,375
Please..

1548
01:42:13,375 --> 01:42:16,542
Why in the world does Ishida have to be injured!

1549
01:42:17,584 --> 01:42:19,751
Don't pretend to be a tragedy heroine!

1550
01:42:21,042 --> 01:42:22,667
Say something!

1551
01:42:23,083 --> 01:42:27,417
"I made a lot of trouble and bothered everyone, "

1552
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:29,709
"so I'll apologize by killing myself."

1553
01:42:29,834 --> 01:42:31,834
"I am very sorry." ??

1554
01:42:32,292 --> 01:42:34,459
How hubris you are!

1555
01:42:34,626 --> 01:42:35,626
Hey, Nishimiya.

1556
01:42:35,792 --> 01:42:37,709
You, totally a blight!

1557
01:42:38,167 --> 01:42:40,459
Like you, a person who think everything

1558
01:42:40,584 --> 01:42:42,584
within your brains,

1559
01:42:42,709 --> 01:42:44,375
is most annoying!

1560
01:42:49,209 --> 01:42:50,334
Ouch!

1561
01:42:50,459 --> 01:42:51,834
Who are you!

1562
01:42:55,626 --> 01:42:58,167
Oh, you must be Nishimiya's mother...

1563
01:42:58,542 --> 01:43:00,667
If you cannot bring up your child,

1564
01:43:00,792 --> 01:43:02,626
you shouldn't have had her in the first place!

1565
01:43:02,751 --> 01:43:03,751
What are you doing?!

1566
01:43:05,501 --> 01:43:06,792
Stop it.

1567
01:43:09,334 --> 01:43:10,542
Stop it!

1568
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Why?

1569
01:43:12,834 --> 01:43:14,042
Why are you doing!?

1570
01:43:26,292 --> 01:43:28,083
...Are you Shoko-san?

1571
01:43:31,292 --> 01:43:33,542
zorry.

1572
01:43:34,792 --> 01:43:36,209
I...I'b zorry.

1573
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:40,417
I'b zorry.

1574
01:43:43,584 --> 01:43:45,626
I'b zorry!

1575
01:43:49,834 --> 01:43:52,417
I'b zorry!!

1576
01:44:05,584 --> 01:44:07,125
What are you doing?

1577
01:44:08,167 --> 01:44:09,292
I thought seeing these photo

1578
01:44:09,876 --> 01:44:13,125
would change sis's mind about wanting to die...

1579
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:20,125
What should I have done?

1580
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,584
Crap, it can't be opened.

1581
01:45:09,751 --> 01:45:11,125
She's holding it shut!

1582
01:45:11,501 --> 01:45:13,876
Oh, Nishimiya-san?

1583
01:45:14,042 --> 01:45:16,501
How about going to the lobby?  I'll buy you a drink.

1584
01:45:16,501 --> 01:45:17,125
(Hospital rooms #400-417)
How about going to the lobby?  I'll buy you a drink.

1585
01:45:17,125 --> 01:45:18,501
(Hospital rooms #400-417)

1586
01:45:18,501 --> 01:45:21,000
I heard things between you and Ya-sho in the past.

1587
01:45:23,417 --> 01:45:25,826
"I destroyed what Ishida-kun created working so hard."

1588
01:45:26,751 --> 01:45:29,042
Do you mean what happened at the bridge?

1589
01:45:30,375 --> 01:45:34,334
Actually, Ya-sho accepted a trivial guy like me.

1590
01:45:34,834 --> 01:45:37,584
I learned what real friends are at that moment,

1591
01:45:37,709 --> 01:45:39,375
for the first time.

1592
01:45:43,959 --> 01:45:46,792
Ya-sho is my "big friend",

1593
01:45:46,918 --> 01:45:49,334
so I am totally at a loss until he wakes up again.

1594
01:45:57,417 --> 01:46:01,017
"I want to fix up what I destroyed."

1595
01:46:02,626 --> 01:46:03,626
Oh...

1596
01:46:06,792 --> 01:46:09,542
It's silly you tried to kill yourself even you were hurt!

1597
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,250
You speaking too loud, Kawai-san...

1598
01:46:12,375 --> 01:46:16,334
Nishimiya-san can't hear unless we speak loudly!

1599
01:46:18,501 --> 01:46:21,042
Everyone worried about you.

1600
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:24,542
Everyone has hard experiences in the life.

1601
01:46:25,125 --> 01:46:27,250
Everyone has, don't you think so?

1602
01:46:27,417 --> 01:46:28,584
So,

1603
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,876
we have to go forward, loving ourselves,

1604
01:46:31,209 --> 01:46:34,000
as a whole including weaknesses.

1605
01:46:37,918 --> 01:46:39,584
I am relieved to know you are ok now.

1606
01:46:43,125 --> 01:46:44,125
Then,

1607
01:46:44,375 --> 01:46:46,792
you are visiting around to meet members at the bridge.

1608
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,417
You are strong...

1609
01:46:50,584 --> 01:46:53,250
Honestly, I'm scared.

1610
01:46:53,918 --> 01:46:57,083
Even after Ishida-kun wakes up,

1611
01:46:57,209 --> 01:47:00,501
I have no courage to see him again.

1612
01:47:00,834 --> 01:47:03,584
I couldn't change myself.

1613
01:47:04,125 --> 01:47:06,292
I ran away again and failed to save you again.

1614
01:47:06,626 --> 01:47:08,083
I'm still a coward.

1615
01:47:09,918 --> 01:47:12,292
Yu bill jange brom now on,

1616
01:47:14,209 --> 01:47:15,709
Zaara-zan...

1617
01:47:18,918 --> 01:47:21,918
Thank to come to meet me, Sho-chan.

1618
01:48:03,792 --> 01:48:07,000
Hey, stop it!

1619
01:48:16,292 --> 01:48:17,292
Nishimiya.

1620
01:48:18,417 --> 01:48:19,417
I found you.

1621
01:48:21,167 --> 01:48:22,717
Are you doing well?

1622
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:26,250
Somewhat

1623
01:48:26,918 --> 01:48:27,918
Strange, isn't it?

1624
01:48:29,959 --> 01:48:30,959
I am

1625
01:48:31,375 --> 01:48:32,501
thinking I'd die.

1626
01:48:33,667 --> 01:48:34,667
Oh.

1627
01:48:35,501 --> 01:48:36,501
Tuesday is almost over.

1628
01:48:39,014 --> 01:48:40,014
Bye.

1629
01:48:41,045 --> 01:48:42,045
Nishimiya.

1630
01:49:44,459 --> 01:49:46,375
Ha! Nishimiya!

1631
01:49:49,709 --> 01:49:50,834
What's this?

1632
01:49:51,542 --> 01:49:52,626
Hey mom!

1633
01:49:52,751 --> 01:49:53,792
This..

1634
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,167
Get rid of this!

1635
01:50:02,626 --> 01:50:04,417
Nishimiya

1636
01:50:07,083 --> 01:50:08,125
Nishimiya

1637
01:50:17,167 --> 01:50:18,167
Nishimiya

1638
01:50:19,042 --> 01:50:21,459
Nishimiya

1639
01:50:23,042 --> 01:50:24,125
Nishimiya

1640
01:50:39,083 --> 01:50:40,083
Yo!

1641
01:51:08,292 --> 01:51:09,375
Ha.

1642
01:51:10,584 --> 01:51:11,584
Pff!

1643
01:51:13,834 --> 01:51:16,459
Ahahaha.

1644
01:51:17,292 --> 01:51:18,417
Well..

1645
01:51:22,626 --> 01:51:24,000
Are you all right?

1646
01:51:30,667 --> 01:51:31,667
Yes.

1647
01:51:32,709 --> 01:51:33,959
I'm glad to know

1648
01:51:35,167 --> 01:51:36,375
you are ok.

1649
01:51:40,542 --> 01:51:41,542
Nishimiya.

1650
01:51:41,918 --> 01:51:44,959
I'm ok now too

1651
01:51:46,209 --> 01:51:47,626
...more or less.

1652
01:51:49,584 --> 01:51:53,125
Please stop to make such a serious face.

1653
01:51:53,584 --> 01:51:54,751
And, let me say..

1654
01:51:58,042 --> 01:51:59,334
Nishimiya-san.

1655
01:52:01,292 --> 01:52:02,709
I am sorry.

1656
01:52:03,501 --> 01:52:08,292
I never really apologized for what I did in the past.

1657
01:52:09,167 --> 01:52:12,417
In addition, what I did after we met again.

1658
01:52:12,709 --> 01:52:14,125
So many things I did.

1659
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,167
Perhaps,

1660
01:52:17,417 --> 01:52:19,209
I interpret you

1661
01:52:19,334 --> 01:52:22,751
to suit my interest.

1662
01:52:23,417 --> 01:52:24,417
Actually, I want to

1663
01:52:24,918 --> 01:52:27,167
talk more

1664
01:52:27,334 --> 01:52:28,626
with you.

1665
01:52:30,209 --> 01:52:32,584
Perhaps that's all.

1666
01:52:33,292 --> 01:52:37,000
But my selfish behavior had hurt you,

1667
01:52:37,834 --> 01:52:41,584
and forced you to choose the worst choice

1668
01:52:43,125 --> 01:52:44,125
Noooo, Zat'z nod gorregd.

1669
01:52:44,501 --> 01:52:47,000
Begauze I had nod jenged,

01:52:47,292 --> 01:52:48,959

1671

1672
01:52:51,417 --> 01:52:54,501
dodally blamed.

1673
01:52:55,083 --> 01:52:58,292
Everizing would go vell

1674
01:52:58,709 --> 01:53:00,459

1675
01:53:01,501 --> 01:53:04,292
I'b zorry..

1676
01:53:04,417 --> 01:53:06,459
Don't cry, Nishimiya.

1677
01:53:10,542 --> 01:53:13,042
Well, Nishimiya.

1678
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:19,542
Just before,

1679
01:53:19,667 --> 01:53:21,501
I talked to you in my dreams.

1680
01:53:22,584 --> 01:53:23,918
In the dream,

1681
01:53:24,542 --> 01:53:28,083
Perhaps I had tried to give up many things in my life.

1682
01:53:29,334 --> 01:53:31,792
But I realized it is not correct.

1683
01:53:32,375 --> 01:53:36,959
I thought the same way as you.

1684
01:53:37,834 --> 01:53:38,959
But,

1685
01:53:39,709 --> 01:53:40,959
I realized,

1686
01:53:41,417 --> 01:53:45,209
that it still wasn't worth to death.

1687
01:53:47,083 --> 01:53:50,626
I want to apologize to others, too.

1688
01:53:53,125 --> 01:53:55,751
So, Nishimiya.

1689
01:53:55,876 --> 01:53:56,876
I want

1690
01:54:00,459 --> 01:54:01,584
you to

1691
01:54:02,709 --> 01:54:04,000
help me

1692
01:54:04,834 --> 01:54:06,209
live.

1693
01:54:15,209 --> 01:54:16,667
Nishimiya.

1694
01:54:37,959 --> 01:54:39,209
Wow!

1695
01:54:39,334 --> 01:54:42,292
What a creepy things I just did!

1696
01:54:42,542 --> 01:54:43,626
Oops!

1697
01:54:43,792 --> 01:54:45,918
Sorry, but forget all, Nishimiya!

1698
01:54:46,042 --> 01:54:47,876
Forget what I did now!

1699
01:55:11,250 --> 01:55:13,542
Hey, customer!  You arrived!

1700
01:55:15,959 --> 01:55:19,250
Hey, Maria, are you watering flowers?

1701
01:55:19,375 --> 01:55:20,959
You are great!

1702
01:55:23,459 --> 01:55:25,876
You die?  die? dieeeeeee?

1703
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,334
Maria, Sho-chan bring back to life.

1704
01:55:29,459 --> 01:55:31,417
I'm not dead, Maria.

1705
01:55:31,542 --> 01:55:32,292
Huh?

1706
01:55:32,417 --> 01:55:33,918
Is she Ueno-san?

1707
01:55:35,501 --> 01:55:38,792
She have attended and took care of you when you were asleep.

1708
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:41,000
Say thank you to her.

1709
01:55:43,542 --> 01:55:45,292
I heard you took care of me.

1710
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,834
I'm really a no good one...

1711
01:55:49,834 --> 01:55:52,042
I still, or even more,

1712
01:55:52,167 --> 01:55:56,334
unable to like Nishimiya-san.

1713
01:55:57,417 --> 01:55:59,292
Huh, may be ok not to force to change myself...

1714
01:55:59,834 --> 01:56:01,959
And, It was Shimada and Hirose,

1715
01:56:02,083 --> 01:56:05,209
who saved you when you fell into the river.

1716
01:56:06,083 --> 01:56:08,375
They asked me not to tell it to you, but I wanted to tell.

1717
01:56:09,167 --> 01:56:10,167
Ishida.

1718
01:56:11,375 --> 01:56:12,709
Welcome back!

1719
01:56:13,167 --> 01:56:15,125
Then I'll go home.

1720
01:56:16,459 --> 01:56:17,751
Thank you.

1721
01:56:27,083 --> 01:56:29,167
Oh, it's too short, isn't it!?

1722
01:56:29,501 --> 01:56:32,042
No, no, you will be the cutest in such short hair!

1723
01:56:32,209 --> 01:56:33,751
Hi, welcome back, Sho-chan.

1724
01:56:33,876 --> 01:56:34,876
Huh, h...hello.

1725
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,792
Hi, welcome to the salon...

1726
01:56:38,959 --> 01:56:40,417
Ishida-kun.

1727
01:56:41,542 --> 01:56:42,751
I'm sorry for what happened around.

1728
01:56:42,918 --> 01:56:45,167
No, I'm sorry too.

1729
01:56:45,375 --> 01:56:47,417
That's right.  My son is immortal.

1730
01:56:47,584 --> 01:56:50,334
Hi mom, I'll go to pick Maria up.

1731
01:56:50,542 --> 01:56:51,876
What!?  Who is that guy?

1732
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,501
My daughter's husband.  He came back from Brazil.

1733
01:56:55,167 --> 01:56:58,000
And Sho-chan.  Yuzu-chan is in your room.

1734
01:56:58,459 --> 01:57:00,542
Take some desserts from the refrigerator for her.

1735
01:57:00,667 --> 01:57:02,042
Hey.

1736
01:57:02,334 --> 01:57:03,417
Hi.

1737
01:57:03,792 --> 01:57:05,792
Is that the winter-season uniform?  That's fit to you.

1738
01:57:05,918 --> 01:57:07,375
By the way, take a look on this.

1739
01:57:07,667 --> 01:57:10,375
Oh, my.  Great!

1740
01:57:10,501 --> 01:57:11,834
And. take another look on this.

1741
01:57:12,083 --> 01:57:14,542
Oh, my...

1742
01:57:14,792 --> 01:57:16,042
Have mercy, kind sir!

1743
01:57:16,167 --> 01:57:18,250
You must help me!

1744
01:57:18,501 --> 01:57:19,709
Sure.  Of course I will.

1745
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:26,125
You have resumed to go to school, haven't you?

1746
01:57:26,334 --> 01:57:28,918
Yes.  Shoko gave me a good trigger to resume.

1747
01:57:30,751 --> 01:57:33,501
Well, I will do my best.

1748
01:57:33,918 --> 01:57:35,667
I wanna meet her expectations.

1749
01:57:38,125 --> 01:57:40,042
By the way, a school festival will be held tomorrow?

1750
01:57:40,501 --> 01:57:42,042
Yes.

1751
01:57:47,501 --> 01:57:48,000
Shoko Nishimiya: Hello

1752
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,200
It was said everyone are going to the school festival tomorrow.

1753
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:50,200
I will meet you at the front gate at 10:00, it that ok?

1754
01:57:51,167 --> 01:57:52,918
Good morning, everyone!

1755
01:57:53,292 --> 01:57:54,584
Are you all ok?

1756
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,209
I'm sorry for what I said at the bridge!

1757
01:58:07,375 --> 01:58:08,375
It's time to go!

1758
01:58:08,542 --> 01:58:09,542
I'm going to school!

1759
01:58:09,667 --> 01:58:10,667
Bye!  Cheer up!

1760
01:58:11,125 --> 01:58:12,667
Oh!

1761
01:58:12,792 --> 01:58:14,584
These items are used like that!

1762
01:58:14,709 --> 01:58:15,501
What?

1763
01:58:15,626 --> 01:58:18,083
Nothing.  I'll go.

1764
01:58:18,209 --> 01:58:19,792
Good luck!

1765
01:58:35,334 --> 01:58:36,918
Good morning.

1766
01:58:40,459 --> 01:58:41,667
Why don't we get going?

1767
01:58:50,375 --> 01:58:52,292
Hey, isn't that Ishida?

1768
01:58:53,209 --> 01:58:54,209
Who?

1769
01:58:54,375 --> 01:58:56,876
Huh?  The jumping-into guy?

1770
01:58:57,292 --> 01:58:58,292
Oops..

1771
01:59:02,667 --> 01:59:04,959
Honestly, it is the first time I say to you,

1772
01:59:05,083 --> 01:59:08,292
I don't really fit in at school.

1773
01:59:10,834 --> 01:59:15,000
I have difficulty even looking everyone in the eyes.

1774
01:59:15,334 --> 01:59:19,209
So it is easier for me to look downward.

1775
01:59:22,667 --> 01:59:24,834
Huh?  It's ok to look downward?

1776
01:59:27,125 --> 01:59:28,542
Ni..Nishimiya..

1777
01:59:29,083 --> 01:59:31,334
I can walk normally my myself you know.

1778
01:59:32,375 --> 01:59:33,918
Thank you, Nishimiya.

1779
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:36,209
Here is my class.

1780
01:59:41,501 --> 01:59:43,834
Ishida-kun?  Hey, it's Ishida-kun!

1781
01:59:43,959 --> 01:59:46,501
Are you ok now?

1782
01:59:48,334 --> 01:59:49,542
Nishimiya.

1783
01:59:49,792 --> 01:59:52,834
I'm feeling like a kind of stomachache.

1784
01:59:54,501 --> 01:59:55,501
Sorry.

1785
01:59:55,667 --> 01:59:56,542
Ya-sho!

1786
01:59:56,667 --> 01:59:57,667
Huh?

1787
02:00:09,751 --> 02:00:10,834
Ya-sho?

1788
02:00:12,417 --> 02:00:13,792
Nagatsuka---kun?

1789
02:00:14,125 --> 02:00:16,125
Ya-sho, are you suffering stomachache?

1790
02:00:18,959 --> 02:00:19,959
Ya-sho.

1791
02:00:20,501 --> 02:00:23,709
Hi, Nagatsuka-kun.  Good morning.  Are you ok?

1792
02:00:24,334 --> 02:00:25,834
Ya-sho.

1793
02:00:25,959 --> 02:00:27,876
Why you are looking downward?

1794
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,209
Oh, really?  I don't know why.

1795
02:00:30,667 --> 02:00:34,209
Actually I went here to raise my face to meet you all.

1796
02:00:34,375 --> 02:00:35,459
But I might be a bit scared...

1797
02:00:36,042 --> 02:00:38,250
Hey, Ya-sho..?

1798
02:00:38,584 --> 02:00:39,584
Ishida-kun!!

1799
02:00:40,417 --> 02:00:42,751
I'm really really happy you come back.

1800
02:00:44,042 --> 02:00:45,542
If you.., oops,

1801
02:00:46,167 --> 02:00:48,501
If you hadn't waken up again,

1802
02:00:48,626 --> 02:00:51,501
I would have lost everything.

1803
02:00:52,292 --> 02:00:52,959
Ya-sho,

1804
02:00:53,292 --> 02:00:55,209
Don't be mind any more

1805
02:00:55,334 --> 02:00:56,459
what happened at the bridge.

1806
02:00:56,792 --> 02:00:59,834
Such minor troubles will happen again and again as far as we live.

1807
02:01:00,334 --> 02:01:02,667
So, Ya-sho, please please,

1808
02:01:03,083 --> 02:01:05,501
never go far away leaving me!

1809
02:01:05,709 --> 02:01:07,083
Pleeeease!

1810
02:01:07,209 --> 02:01:08,834
Nagatsuka-kun.

1811
02:01:10,417 --> 02:01:11,542
I'm very sorry

1812
02:01:11,667 --> 02:01:14,250
for so many things.

1813
02:01:15,501 --> 02:01:16,584
And,

1814
02:01:17,250 --> 02:01:18,459
thank you.

1815
02:01:18,792 --> 02:01:20,751
Ya-sho!

1816
02:01:21,209 --> 02:01:22,792
By the way, what's happened with your mustache?

1817
02:01:23,417 --> 02:01:27,501
This was a pray icon for your recovery.

1818
02:01:28,042 --> 02:01:29,792
Nagatsuka-kun.

1819
02:01:34,459 --> 02:01:35,292
Huh?

1820
02:01:35,417 --> 02:01:36,959
Why everyone here..

1821
02:01:37,083 --> 02:01:41,417
As we have heard Nagatsuka-kun's calling Ishida-kun's name.

1822
02:01:41,792 --> 02:01:43,083
I see.

1823
02:01:43,459 --> 02:01:46,542
Kawai-san. you have the you-know-what to give him,

1824
02:01:46,667 --> 02:01:47,667
don't you?

1825
02:01:47,709 --> 02:01:49,751
Huh...yes, I have.

1826
02:01:49,876 --> 02:01:52,125
but it was a failure, so we cannot give him that...

1827
02:01:52,375 --> 02:01:54,834
Why not?  Let's give it to him.

1828
02:01:55,292 --> 02:01:56,667
Ok...

1829
02:02:00,250 --> 02:02:02,334
This is.. "thousand paper cranes"

1830
02:02:02,459 --> 02:02:05,584
I really worked hard to collect a thousand,

1831
02:02:05,709 --> 02:02:07,042
but I couldn't it is far less than a thousand...

1832
02:02:07,459 --> 02:02:10,375
I asked all the classmates again and again, but..

1833
02:02:10,584 --> 02:02:11,876
I'm very sorry.

1834
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,626
N--No, it's amazing!

1835
02:02:13,751 --> 02:02:14,918
It's enough.

1836
02:02:15,042 --> 02:02:17,250
I've never gotten anything like that before,

1837
02:02:17,375 --> 02:02:19,209
and I am really happy.

1838
02:02:19,834 --> 02:02:21,334
Thank you Kawai-san.

1839
02:02:21,459 --> 02:02:23,375
And, I am sorry.

1840
02:02:23,542 --> 02:02:24,542
I'm sorry too, Mashiba-kun.

1841
02:02:25,083 --> 02:02:27,459
Not at all.  You are amazing.

1842
02:02:27,584 --> 02:02:29,626
Ugh

1843
02:02:29,751 --> 02:02:32,667
You are playing friends, that's make me sick!

1844
02:02:32,792 --> 02:02:35,501
You are so nasty as always saying such things now, Nao-chan!

1845
02:02:35,792 --> 02:02:37,876
Oh? Kawai-tchi?

1846
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:38,876
Time to fight?

1847
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,125
Hey, stop it, both of two!

1848
02:02:41,501 --> 02:02:43,209
Oh...Ishida-kun.

1849
02:02:43,876 --> 02:02:45,709
I'm sorry, Ishida-kun.

1850
02:02:46,042 --> 02:02:48,918
You have been through so much,

1851
02:02:49,667 --> 02:02:51,167
while I have not changed a bit.

1852
02:02:52,751 --> 02:02:53,918
Don't say so.

1853
02:02:54,584 --> 02:02:55,959
I have not changed, too.

1854
02:02:57,334 --> 02:03:00,459
Hey, we don't talk nothing negative or serious now!.

1855
02:03:02,918 --> 02:03:04,417
You said sorry again!

1856
02:03:05,626 --> 02:03:08,334
But, I suppose that is your personality.

1857
02:03:09,167 --> 02:03:10,792
Stu--pit! (Ha / ka)

1858
02:03:15,501 --> 02:03:17,125
Stu--pid. (Ba / ka)

1859
02:03:17,834 --> 02:03:19,292
Stupid! (Baka!)

1860
02:03:19,667 --> 02:03:20,667
Ah..

1861
02:03:21,959 --> 02:03:23,417
Pff!

1862
02:03:25,459 --> 02:03:27,083
Hey, I'm now hungry.

1863
02:03:27,292 --> 02:03:28,584
I'll go out to have fried chickens!

1864
02:03:28,918 --> 02:03:29,918
Oh, she ran away.

1865
02:03:29,959 --> 02:03:31,292
No, she got embarrassed.

1866
02:03:34,459 --> 02:03:35,459
Hi, everyone,

1867
02:03:35,542 --> 02:03:38,083
I have a favor to ask you all.

1868
02:03:38,292 --> 02:03:39,292
Is it ok?

1869
02:03:40,918 --> 02:03:45,375
I want to go around the school festival together.

1870
02:04:04,292 --> 02:04:06,209
Hummm, it tastes really good!

1871
02:04:06,334 --> 02:04:08,459
Let's go to gymnasium next!

1872
02:04:08,626 --> 02:04:10,834
I'm amazed he can even show his face at school.

1873
02:04:10,959 --> 02:04:13,459
Hey, hey, the stall by class #B is really good!

1874
02:04:13,626 --> 02:04:14,626
Really? Let's go together!

1875
02:05:57,667 --> 02:06:00,709
"Fell in love as"

1876
02:06:00,834 --> 02:06:07,375
Ah...I fell in love...

1877
02:06:25,459 --> 02:06:28,209
Well, please raise your face

1878
02:06:28,209 --> 02:06:32,375
Then you can see I am here in front of you

1879
02:06:32,375 --> 02:06:37,167
So stop crying any more

1880
02:06:41,250 --> 02:06:47,751
You gave me special time even when my heart had been broken

1881
02:06:47,751 --> 02:06:55,751
A red which was a bit tangled

1882
02:07:00,459 --> 02:07:08,459
A white which was a color of corridor at that days

1883
02:07:12,292 --> 02:07:20,292
Beginning, last time, and now

1884
02:07:22,584 --> 02:07:30,584
I'll convey you carving on petals which are fluttering

1885
02:07:34,292 --> 02:07:35,792
Darling

1886
02:07:35,792 --> 02:07:43,792
I and you reflected on raindrops

1887
02:07:45,876 --> 02:07:53,876
No one in the world knows

1888
02:08:01,417 --> 02:08:07,042
Ah...I fell in love... I don't remember since when

1889
02:08:07,042 --> 02:08:10,542
How many times I cried

1890
02:08:10,542 --> 02:08:16,417
If I count it, it will take whole night

1891
02:08:16,417 --> 02:08:21,167
I'll be puzzled...

1892
02:08:21,167 --> 02:08:25,501
Darling

1893
02:08:34,250 --> 02:08:41,792
What I want to convey to you now

1894
02:08:42,792 --> 02:08:47,167
has been same and not changed

1895
02:08:47,167 --> 02:08:55,167
since the past times.

1896
02:08:56,334 --> 02:08:57,751
Darling

1897
02:08:57,751 --> 02:09:05,751
The only one signpost

1898
02:09:08,042 --> 02:09:16,042
we can walk without losing way
