3
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:55,826
He's not happy
you took the car again.

4
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:58,242
Like I give a fuck.

5
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,742
Boy!

6
00:02:44,242 --> 00:02:45,742
You hear me?

7
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:47,742
What do you want?

8
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:51,701
You take my car again?

9
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,367
No. What car?

10
00:02:53,534 --> 00:02:54,617
No?

11
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:58,576
I just drove some Turkish tourists
from the border.

12
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:00,451
Turkish tourists?

13
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:03,617
I'm tryin' to make money
like you're always on about.

14
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:08,242
You sit like that in front of my wife?

15
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:13,992
Go do that in the other room.

16
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,076
What? I'm covered up.

17
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:17,992
Go!

18
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,117
There's some woman
in front of our house.

19
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:28,617
I'll be damned.

20
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:31,742
Ms. Lia?

21
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:33,992
Ms. Lia.

22
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:38,117
Ruso, get out here, girl!
We got a guest!

23
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:44,867
Don't you recognize me?

24
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:46,242
No.

25
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:48,659
Your old student, Zaza?

26
00:03:48,826 --> 00:03:50,034
You've gotten fat.

27
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:53,701
Ms. Lia, what you doing out here?

28
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,701
Asking around for someone
who knew my niece.

29
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:59,076
She used to live in these cottages.

30
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:00,492
Really?

31
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,659
Yes, they say she moved
across the border to Istanbul.

32
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,409
Come on inside,
we'll ask my wife,

33
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:07,451
she'll know something.
Welcome.

34
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:08,617
Ruso!

35
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:11,284
Sorry for just barging in like this.

36
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,409
Not at all. Please sit.

37
00:04:15,284 --> 00:04:16,284
Boy!

38
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:19,784
Bring a good bottle!

39
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:23,367
This woman's classy and refined,

40
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:25,159
unlike you lot.

41
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:32,284
Georgia's future...

42
00:04:33,492 --> 00:04:34,784
Degenerates.

43
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:36,784
Useless, the whole lot.

44
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:38,909
Bring the glasses!

45
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:41,034
Coming up.

46
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:42,909
So, Ms. Lia...

47
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:49,867
Cheers.

48
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:03,451
Forgive me
for what I'm about to tell you.

49
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:05,784
What are you sorry about?

50
00:05:06,742 --> 00:05:10,909
Some strange people used to live
in those cottages...

51
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:15,159
Prostitutes.

52
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:20,284
I'm not saying your niece...

53
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:23,159
What's the name of your niece?

54
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,659
She calls herself...

55
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:29,284
Tekla.

56
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:31,784
What? You know this girl?

57
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,284
No.

58
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,951
She's talking about
one of those trans girls.

59
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:38,159
You better watch your mouth, boy!

60
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:41,201
Please forgive my brother.

61
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,242
I'm just trying to help her!

62
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,451
My condolences, Ms. Lia.

63
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:48,201
It's a real tragedy for the family
when these things...

64
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:49,909
Indeed.

65
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:52,701
Boy.

66
00:05:53,784 --> 00:05:54,867
Yes?

67
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:57,201
Did you know her?

68
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:03,617
Nah. Just seen her around,
that's all.

69
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:08,034
A bunch of them were living together.
But then they were kicked out.

70
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:16,409
Alright then...

71
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:21,159
Ms. Lia, why are you looking for her?
Better to just leave it be.

72
00:06:21,534 --> 00:06:23,701
Sorry again for barging in like this.

73
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,784
Not at all.

74
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:34,284
Lady!

75
00:06:35,284 --> 00:06:36,534
Lady, wait!

76
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:41,284
Are you going to Istanbul
to look for your niece?

77
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:43,534
'Cause I got her address.

78
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:46,909
Show me.

79
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:49,534
One second...

80
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,409
See?

81
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,367
What am I supposed to see here?

82
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:56,159
It's in Turkish.

83
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:10,284
- Write it down for me in Georgian.
- Can I go with you?

84
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,909
My mom lives over there too,

85
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:16,159
maybe I can find her and get a job?

86
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:18,492
I speak some Turkish!

87
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:21,451
<i>Hello, my name is Achi, how are you?</i>

88
00:07:21,617 --> 00:07:23,701
And I learned some English
from YouTube.

89
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:25,909
I'll be your translator.

90
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:30,992
- Is this really her address?
- I swear.

91
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,367
She left it in case
someone asked for her.

92
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:37,409
We used to smoke together.

93
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:40,117
She's got friends over there,
she told me.

94
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:42,742
This is their address.
She went to live with them.

95
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:45,159
It's win-win.

96
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,284
- Fine.
- Fine? Are you for real?

97
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:51,367
Wait, when are we leaving?

98
00:07:51,534 --> 00:07:53,117
- Now.
- Now?

99
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:55,034
Wait, what?
Like now, now?

100
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:57,909
- Do you have ID?
- Yes at home.

101
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,909
Meet me down by the border
tomorrow morning.

102
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:02,784
I'll be damned.

103
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:18,284
Lady!

104
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:20,326
Lady!

105
00:08:26,826 --> 00:08:28,992
- What's going on?
- I'll drive you home.

106
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:31,117
What do you want?
What's happened?

107
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:33,159
Let me drop you off!

108
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:40,951
I told you to meet me
tomorrow morning.

109
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:43,284
- Where do you live?
- Up in Khulo.

110
00:08:48,284 --> 00:08:51,242
My brother had my ID
so I punched him to get it back.

111
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:55,409
Clocked him in his fat ugly face!
You should've seen his reaction.

112
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:00,617
So you're her aunt then, or what?

113
00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:01,992
That's correct.

114
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,201
So her mother was your sister?

115
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:07,117
That's usually how it works.

116
00:09:07,284 --> 00:09:09,909
- So where's your sister?
- She passed away.

117
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:11,617
So, why do you wanna find Tekla?

118
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:16,742
I promised her mother
I'd find her and bring her home.

119
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:18,242
It was her dying wish.

120
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:21,117
I'd say my brother knew Tekla
pretty well.

121
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:24,367
He'd sneak into her cottage
more times than I can count.

122
00:09:27,742 --> 00:09:28,867
So are you excited to...

123
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:32,409
Enough of this nonsense.

124
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:36,242
I don't want you blathering on
all the way, is that clear?

125
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,617
Whatever you say, lady.

126
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:41,992
And no drinking or narcotics.
Is that understood?

127
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,326
Who do you think I am?

128
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:45,034
Keep your eyes on the road.

129
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:55,117
What are you waiting for?
Get in and close the door.

130
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:56,867
I'm out of firewood.

131
00:09:57,034 --> 00:09:58,784
It gets real cold here at night.

132
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,451
Help me out.

133
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:49,617
Go fetch some cucumbers
and tomatoes from the neighbor's yard.

134
00:10:49,784 --> 00:10:51,326
Are you kidding me, why?

135
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:52,867
Go on.

136
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:19,659
Wake up.

137
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:25,492
You got any money
of your own with you?

138
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:27,117
No, not really.

139
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:29,951
So now you understand
why we're bringing cucumbers.

140
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:31,867
- Madam Lia?
- What you want?

141
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:36,617
Mom saw you borrow some cucumbers
and tomatoes from our garden.

142
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:39,242
She thought you may want
some pelamushi too?

143
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:40,867
Oh she did, did she?

144
00:13:41,034 --> 00:13:43,742
- Who's that boy?
- None of your business.

145
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:45,451
Are you going on vacation?

146
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,117
Sure, kid.
Tell your mom I'm off to Paris!

147
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:49,617
Paris?

148
00:13:49,784 --> 00:13:51,284
Wow!

149
00:13:52,492 --> 00:13:53,534
Let's go.

150
00:13:56,845 --> 00:13:57,867
Thank you.

151
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:14,159
I don't give a fuck.
I'm never coming back.

152
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:40,534
Passport or ID?

153
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:42,409
One moment.

154
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:49,742
Thank you.

155
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:53,742
Hello.

156
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:55,284
Hello.

157
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:05,159
It looks exactly the same.

158
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:07,909
What did you expect?

159
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:09,992
Isn't this a different country?

160
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,909
Wait until you see Istanbul.

161
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:15,242
Wait, you've been to Istanbul?

162
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:16,701
Once.

163
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:18,701
So, how was it?

164
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:21,659
Did you forget
what I told you in the car?

165
00:15:21,826 --> 00:15:25,326
Yes, sorry. No talking, Ms. Lia.

166
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:27,117
But it must have been cool, right?

167
00:15:27,284 --> 00:15:29,367
It was alright.

168
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:32,326
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hello.

169
00:15:32,492 --> 00:15:33,909
Hello.

170
00:15:39,284 --> 00:15:41,784
All of this.

171
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,534
Off to harvest tea in Rize?

172
00:15:46,034 --> 00:15:47,159
Yes.

173
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:51,867
Do you take gold too?

174
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,201
Yes.

175
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:55,992
My sister's, from when she got married.

176
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,409
It used to belong to my grandmother.

177
00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:02,992
It's supposed to bring good fortune.

178
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:06,284
We've sold them off over the years,
but I kept this pair.

179
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:16,492
- I'll take it.
- For how much?

180
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:19,117
- 2,500 lira.
- Are you nuts?

181
00:16:19,284 --> 00:16:22,576
He's ripping you off. Don't sell.

182
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:25,784
Do you have money for bus tickets?

183
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:27,492
No.

184
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:29,701
You should be ashamed of yourself!

185
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:32,201
I would get three times as much
in Batumi.

186
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,951
Asshole!

187
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:35,284
Be quiet, boy.

188
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:39,284
It seems he's a gold expert too.

189
00:16:40,284 --> 00:16:41,409
Thank you.

190
00:17:03,742 --> 00:17:05,492
Ah, Churchkhela.

191
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:13,367
What?

192
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:11,284
What? You just gotta avoid the part
that's been eaten.

193
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:15,034
Want some?

194
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:18,784
You kidding me?
You brought chacha?

195
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:21,201
What about "No drinking"?

196
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,909
It's so hot.

197
00:18:23,784 --> 00:18:24,867
Maybe it's menopause.

198
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:32,117
What?
My grandma had that.

199
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:34,159
Let's be very clear about something.

200
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:36,284
I'm not here to take care of you.

201
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:38,242
Do you understand?

202
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,409
It was just food poisoning
or something. It's passed now.

203
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:44,909
I don't need anyone taking care of me.

204
00:19:02,492 --> 00:19:05,659
Georgian women
have lost all their dignity.

205
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:10,534
There was a time
when our women were refined.

206
00:19:24,034 --> 00:19:25,409
Ms. Lia.

207
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:28,659
Ms. Lia, wake up!

208
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:31,284
Look outside, we're here.

209
00:19:31,992 --> 00:19:33,159
Look.

210
00:20:26,534 --> 00:20:27,617
Our bag.

211
00:20:27,784 --> 00:20:32,784
Wait... Go talk to that girl
you were ogling on the bus.

212
00:20:32,951 --> 00:20:34,284
Go on, show her the address.

213
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:39,534
Excuse me.

214
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:46,617
Do you know how to get here
fast and cheap?

215
00:20:46,784 --> 00:20:49,742
I don't know, I'm just here for work.

216
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:53,159
- Why don't you search for it?
- I don't have internet here.

217
00:20:56,034 --> 00:20:59,117
Follow this road down.
And from there, take a ferry.

218
00:20:59,284 --> 00:21:01,659
- Okay, thanks.
- No problem.

219
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:37,284
<i>Girl!</i>

220
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:41,242
<i>How are you?</i>

221
00:24:42,326 --> 00:24:43,742
<i>Look at you, all dolled up!</i>

222
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:45,742
<i>Mustafa's taking me out tonight.</i>

223
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:47,159
<i>In public?</i>

224
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:49,117
<i>Of course in public, where else?</i>

225
00:24:49,284 --> 00:24:52,826
<i>Wow! You finally lured him out!</i>

226
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,492
<i>You have no grounds to evict.</i>

227
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,617
<i>Especially not without a prior warning.</i>

228
00:24:56,784 --> 00:24:58,117
<i>My hands are tied.</i>

229
00:24:58,284 --> 00:24:59,492
<i>Why are they tied?</i>

230
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:01,201
<i>Is she supposed to be a lawyer?</i>

231
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:04,242
<i>This is Evrim, a lawyer.
What, she can't be a lawyer?</i>

232
00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:06,367
<i>She volunteers with me at Pink Life.</i>

233
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:08,117
<i>A lawyer? Really?</i>

234
00:25:08,284 --> 00:25:10,242
<i>Ladies, this has nothing
to do with you.</i>

235
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:12,659
<i>Evrim! You know
how to use a needle, right?</i>

236
00:25:12,826 --> 00:25:16,909
<i>Come upstairs for two minutes
and help me out.</i>

237
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:19,867
<i>She doesn't like needles.</i>

238
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:21,909
<i>Just turn around.</i>

239
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:24,992
<i>Don't worry, my mom's a nurse.</i>

240
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:27,367
<i>I have a steady hand.
You won't feel a thing.</i>

241
00:25:27,534 --> 00:25:31,284
<i>She takes dick all day
and she's afraid of a tiny needle.</i>

242
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:33,867
<i>Girl, you get your diploma or what?</i>

243
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,576
<i>Yes, it's all sorted!</i>

244
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,367
<i>Now I'm getting a female ID.</i>

245
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:38,742
<i>Lawyer Evrim!</i>

246
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:43,117
<i>Our savior from the police
and the johns.</i>

247
00:25:43,284 --> 00:25:47,367
<i>You're absolutely right.
I'll save you all, rest assured.</i>

248
00:26:04,742 --> 00:26:06,576
<i>The doctor will see you shortly.</i>

249
00:26:06,742 --> 00:26:08,867
<i>Fill these out while you wait.</i>

250
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,409
<i>- Do you have a pen?
- Here.</i>

251
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,284
<i>- You're up next.
- Coming.</i>

252
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,742
<i>Where do you work now?</i>

253
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:46,492
<i>I work at Pink Life, an NGO.</i>

254
00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:50,117
<i>- And they can afford to pay you?
- Well, a little.</i>

255
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:53,617
<i>So you're not doing any sex work then?</i>

256
00:26:53,784 --> 00:26:55,034
<i>No.</i>

257
00:26:56,854 --> 00:26:57,701
<i>Have you ever?</i>

258
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,284
<i>No, doctor, I haven't.</i>

259
00:27:03,284 --> 00:27:07,534
<i>You need to take these and pay
the gynecologist for a medical exam.</i>

260
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,242
<i>Alright.</i>

261
00:27:12,284 --> 00:27:15,867
<i>Then get these signed
by every department in the hospital.</i>

262
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:16,742
<i>Okay.</i>

263
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:19,326
<i>They are required
to authorize female status.</i>

264
00:27:19,492 --> 00:27:20,742
<i>Okay.</i>

265
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:23,576
<i>And here are the documents
to apply for a female ID.</i>

266
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:28,534
<i>Thank you.
So this is everything, right?</i>

267
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:42,117
<i>By the way, doctor,
your hair looks really nice like that.</i>

268
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:50,367
<i>They told me I need signatures
from every department.</i>

269
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:53,159
<i>Do they cost as much?</i>

270
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:56,034
<i>I don't know
about the other departments.</i>

271
00:28:04,103 --> 00:28:05,117
<i>Here.</i>

272
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,409
<i>Thanks.</i>

273
00:28:49,867 --> 00:28:52,159
<i>Sir?
I can show you the way!</i>

274
00:28:54,534 --> 00:28:55,534
<i>No!</i>

275
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:00,409
<i>Sir!</i>

276
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,409
<i>For 5 lira.</i>

277
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,909
<i>- For 5 lira.
- No.</i>

278
00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:10,867
- Show him the address.
- He's trying to fool us.

279
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:14,159
- I said, show him.
- I bet he can't even read.

280
00:29:16,784 --> 00:29:18,284
There, told you so!

281
00:29:19,701 --> 00:29:20,367
<i>I know!</i>

282
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:55,534
<i>We have very nice, cheap rooms!</i>

283
00:29:58,284 --> 00:30:02,367
<i>Cheap rooms! Cheap rooms!</i>

284
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:24,034
<i>- Hi, Izzet.
- Hi.</i>

285
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:33,117
<i>Hi, Izzet.</i>

286
00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:34,659
<i>Hi.</i>

287
00:30:57,409 --> 00:30:59,242
<i>They say her name's Tekla, Miss Gülşen.</i>

288
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:01,576
<i>Tekla? What kind of name is that?</i>

289
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:03,909
<i>- Is she trans?
- I think so.</i>

290
00:31:04,534 --> 00:31:05,576
<i>She lives on this street?</i>

291
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:08,992
<i>I'd have known if she were here.</i>

292
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,534
<i>How old is she?</i>

293
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:16,284
How old is Tekla?

294
00:31:19,034 --> 00:31:20,409
28.

295
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:26,492
<i>He says 28.</i>

296
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:27,909
<i>Aynur!</i>

297
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:32,867
<i>- Girl, Aynur!
- What is it, already?</i>

298
00:31:33,034 --> 00:31:33,909
<i>Calm down, love.</i>

299
00:31:34,076 --> 00:31:35,867
<i>These people
are looking for someone.</i>

300
00:31:36,034 --> 00:31:38,867
<i>Apparently a trans girl.
Her name's Tekla.</i>

301
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:42,701
<i>A foreign girl. Got any foreign girls
in your building?</i>

302
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,742
<i>No foreign girls here,
you know that.</i>

303
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:46,992
<i>You heard her, child.</i>

304
00:31:47,534 --> 00:31:48,292
<i>No.</i>

305
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:57,076
- <i>Sir, another 5 lira, please.</i>
- No!

306
00:31:57,242 --> 00:31:59,451
<i>I'm very hungry, another 5 lira, please.</i>

307
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:03,159
I'm so fucking fed up. No, leave!

308
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:15,992
Where'd you go?

309
00:32:18,284 --> 00:32:21,034
Is this really the address she gave you?

310
00:32:23,034 --> 00:32:24,159
Yes.

311
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,034
This is the life she chose?

312
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:36,784
I hardly think it was a choice.

313
00:32:45,117 --> 00:32:46,409
So, what now?

314
00:32:50,284 --> 00:32:51,534
I will rest

315
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,951
and clean up for the night.

316
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:56,284
Shower, sleep.

317
00:32:56,784 --> 00:32:59,117
First thing tomorrow,
I'll go door to door.

318
00:32:59,284 --> 00:33:02,492
Someone's bound to know something.
That's what I'm doing.

319
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:04,159
Shall I come with you?

320
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:09,117
Aren't you coming?

321
00:33:09,284 --> 00:33:10,784
Yes. Yes, I am.

322
00:33:29,117 --> 00:33:32,242
- What is she saying?
- Nothing, forget about it.

323
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:01,159
There's no bathroom.

324
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:09,409
There's the shower and the toilet.

325
00:34:15,284 --> 00:34:16,326
Oh, shit.

326
00:34:16,492 --> 00:34:17,867
The door doesn't lock.

327
00:34:18,034 --> 00:34:20,284
You'll stand here

328
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:23,534
and keep guard until I finish.

329
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:27,617
Won't people just hear the shower
and know it's busy?

330
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:30,909
This place is probably full of perverts.

331
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:23,784
- Are you done?
- I am.

332
00:35:26,284 --> 00:35:27,867
What are you looking at?

333
00:35:28,034 --> 00:35:31,034
Don't you know a chacha
a day keeps the doctor away?

334
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:33,992
I'm pretty sure that's
an apple a day.

335
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,534
It disinfects the body.

336
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:40,409
Do you want some?

337
00:35:54,784 --> 00:35:56,826
- Ms. Lia...
- Yes.

338
00:35:56,992 --> 00:35:59,534
- Can I ask you something?
- No.

339
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,492
What's your plan after you find Tekla?

340
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:04,576
My plan?
What do you mean?

341
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:06,659
Yeah, like for your future?

342
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:09,992
I have no future and thus no plans.

343
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:15,659
I'm just here until I'm not.

344
00:36:16,534 --> 00:36:18,909
Turn off the lights, it's time to sleep.

345
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:39,534
Ms. Lia?

346
00:36:45,076 --> 00:36:47,451
When was the last time you saw Tekla?

347
00:36:47,617 --> 00:36:49,659
What is this, question and answer time?

348
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:52,617
I told you to sleep.

349
00:36:54,909 --> 00:36:56,242
Sorry.

350
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:07,534
It was many years ago...

351
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:12,617
Right before
her father ran her off for good.

352
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:16,201
Why, because she was trans?

353
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,117
Yes, what else?

354
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:22,992
It was a great shame...

355
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,867
for our family.

356
00:37:27,784 --> 00:37:31,992
Can you imagine
everyone's reaction in the village?

357
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:34,701
I can't even...

358
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:38,659
She was so smart, curious...

359
00:37:39,617 --> 00:37:42,159
Used to ask me questions
about everything.

360
00:37:42,534 --> 00:37:45,784
She could've really become something.

361
00:37:47,742 --> 00:37:50,992
We didn't know about
these kinds of things back then.

362
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:54,242
Of course I'd heard stories but...

363
00:37:55,284 --> 00:37:58,992
There was a boy in the next village
who was shot dead.

364
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:02,492
The boy's father claimed

365
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:06,242
he was cleaning his rifle
when it accidentally went off.

366
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:15,826
So...

367
00:38:15,992 --> 00:38:18,159
What will you tell her if you find her?

368
00:38:19,784 --> 00:38:20,992
I...

369
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:25,492
don't know.

370
00:38:28,992 --> 00:38:30,617
Go to sleep now.

371
00:38:34,034 --> 00:38:35,867
Sorry. Good night.

372
00:39:13,242 --> 00:39:15,284
Fuck this!

373
00:40:23,909 --> 00:40:26,367
<i>May I take your order?</i>

374
00:40:26,534 --> 00:40:29,826
<i>I'm waiting for my friend.
Just another five minutes, please.</i>

375
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:31,284
<i>- Of course.
- Thank you.</i>

376
00:40:41,451 --> 00:40:43,034
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

377
00:40:46,034 --> 00:40:48,034
<i>Fucking bastard.</i>

378
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:58,659
<i>Need a ride?</i>

379
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,284
<i>No.</i>

380
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:03,992
<i>- I'll drop you off.
- I'm not a prostitute.</i>

381
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,701
<i>I'm not saying you are.</i>

382
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:07,159
<i>I'm trans.</i>

383
00:41:09,742 --> 00:41:10,826
<i>Did I ask?</i>

384
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,909
<i>I'll smoke one too.</i>

385
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:50,617
<i>So you're into picking up trans girls?</i>

386
00:41:51,034 --> 00:41:52,117
<i>No.</i>

387
00:41:57,992 --> 00:41:59,034
<i>So?</i>

388
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:02,492
<i>Where do I drop you off?</i>

389
00:42:02,784 --> 00:42:03,909
<i>Me?</i>

390
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:07,367
<i>So you're actually a driver?</i>

391
00:42:07,534 --> 00:42:09,284
<i>Yes.</i>

392
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:13,242
<i>But you need to sit up front.</i>

393
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:15,867
<i>Or we'll get in trouble
if the police stop us.</i>

394
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,034
<i>Come.</i>

395
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:24,742
<i>If they stop us,
we're friends from school,</i>

396
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:27,534
<i>on our way
to a friend's birthday, Okay?</i>

397
00:42:31,659 --> 00:42:34,284
<i>Why don't you just drive
a regular taxi instead?</i>

398
00:42:37,034 --> 00:42:39,367
<i>Just getting the license
is super expensive.</i>

399
00:42:39,534 --> 00:42:43,034
<i>Plus, the market for pirate taxis
has exploded since the inflation.</i>

400
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:46,409
<i>What school?</i>

401
00:42:48,737 --> 00:42:49,617
<i>What?</i>

402
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:53,284
<i>If we're classmates,
what are we studying? And where?</i>

403
00:42:55,284 --> 00:42:56,617
<i>I don't know.</i>

404
00:42:56,909 --> 00:42:58,284
<i>Economy?</i>

405
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,784
<i>Istanbul University?</i>

406
00:43:03,909 --> 00:43:06,076
<i>I love this song.
Can you turn it up?</i>

407
00:43:06,826 --> 00:43:09,576
<i>Everything keeps</i>

408
00:43:09,784 --> 00:43:13,117
<i>Reminding me of you</i>

409
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:16,076
<i>Come back, come back</i>

410
00:43:18,117 --> 00:43:21,409
<i>I beg you, come back to me...</i>

411
00:43:21,742 --> 00:43:23,617
<i>Don't you want to know my name?</i>

412
00:43:23,784 --> 00:43:28,201
<i>Just saying, if the police stop us
they will know we're not really friends.</i>

413
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:29,659
<i>You're right.</i>

414
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:31,659
<i>I'm Ömer.</i>

415
00:43:33,659 --> 00:43:35,909
<i>- How old are you?
- 25.</i>

416
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:39,617
<i>Nice to meet you. I'm Evrim.</i>

417
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,367
<i>I'm 33.</i>

418
00:43:41,534 --> 00:43:42,992
<i>My star sign is Gemini.</i>

419
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:45,117
<i>We don't need to know that much.</i>

420
00:43:45,284 --> 00:43:46,492
<i>Come on!</i>

421
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:47,909
<i>Fine.</i>

422
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:50,534
<i>Mine is Sagittarius.</i>

423
00:43:51,701 --> 00:43:53,034
<i>Born in December.</i>

424
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:56,701
<i>We're opposite sides of the zodiac.</i>

425
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:59,617
<i>It's the ultimate combo, you know?</i>

426
00:43:59,784 --> 00:44:01,909
<i>In both friendship and love.</i>

427
00:44:14,909 --> 00:44:16,742
<i>From the hostel!</i>

428
00:44:18,284 --> 00:44:20,409
<i>- He's staying at the hostel.
- Hello.</i>

429
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:29,909
<i>My name is Achi, how are you?</i>

430
00:44:32,534 --> 00:44:35,367
<i>My name is Özge.
Do you speak Turkish?</i>

431
00:44:35,534 --> 00:44:36,659
<i>No.</i>

432
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:42,867
<i>Neighbor!</i>

433
00:44:43,034 --> 00:44:44,367
<i>- Georgia.
- Yes.</i>

434
00:44:44,534 --> 00:44:47,242
<i>Oh, neighboring country.</i>

435
00:44:51,992 --> 00:44:53,992
<i>Come on, let's go to the party.</i>

436
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,784
<i>Yes, the party!</i>

437
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:04,117
<i>Let me take this off your hands.</i>

438
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:07,992
<i>- Don't pretend to be all shy now.
- Come on, let's go.</i>

439
00:45:20,326 --> 00:45:21,576
<i>Girl!</i>

440
00:45:21,742 --> 00:45:23,034
<i>You came!</i>

441
00:45:23,992 --> 00:45:26,492
<i>- Who's he?
- He's nobody. Never mind.</i>

442
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:28,326
<i>Did Mustafa show up?</i>

443
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,492
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

444
00:45:29,659 --> 00:45:32,451
<i>- Did he really?
- I swear on my mother's grave.</i>

445
00:45:32,617 --> 00:45:35,117
<i>Like you give a shit
about your mother.</i>

446
00:46:53,867 --> 00:46:55,992
<i>I didn't order this.</i>

447
00:47:03,701 --> 00:47:05,409
<i>What else would you like?</i>

448
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,284
<i>Pistachio.</i>

449
00:47:11,617 --> 00:47:13,284
<i>He's saying pistachio.</i>

450
00:47:16,076 --> 00:47:18,451
<i>- Walnut baklava.
- Walnut baklava.</i>

451
00:47:19,784 --> 00:47:22,284
<i>How much do we owe?</i>

452
00:47:22,451 --> 00:47:24,242
<i>You can pay later.</i>

453
00:47:27,284 --> 00:47:28,492
Hello.

454
00:47:29,534 --> 00:47:30,784
Hello.

455
00:48:35,784 --> 00:48:36,992
<i>Good morning.</i>

456
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:45,284
<i>You take care of the peppers,
I'll do the rest...</i>

457
00:52:46,492 --> 00:52:47,742
Hello.

458
00:52:49,242 --> 00:52:50,117
<i>Gülşen!</i>

459
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:53,992
<i>- It's that woman again.
- What woman?</i>

460
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:56,326
<i>She's not going to give up it seems.</i>

461
00:52:56,492 --> 00:52:58,242
Do you remember me?

462
00:52:58,826 --> 00:53:01,367
<i>Well don't just stand there,
come on inside.</i>

463
00:53:01,534 --> 00:53:03,451
<i>Don't just stand there, go on.</i>

464
00:53:03,617 --> 00:53:05,117
<i>Come in.</i>

465
00:53:08,117 --> 00:53:09,409
<i>Dear lord.</i>

466
00:53:11,034 --> 00:53:13,367
<i>Take a seat, please.</i>

467
00:53:16,242 --> 00:53:17,826
Eggplant.

468
00:53:19,617 --> 00:53:21,951
<i>- What?</i>
- Eggplant.

469
00:53:22,659 --> 00:53:24,242
<i>Oh, eggplant.</i>

470
00:53:24,867 --> 00:53:26,826
<i>It's almost the same.</i>

471
00:53:26,992 --> 00:53:28,659
<i>Let her try some Turkish tea.</i>

472
00:53:29,451 --> 00:53:31,034
<i>Smuggled tea, actually.</i>

473
00:53:39,284 --> 00:53:41,076
Do you know Tekla?

474
00:53:42,701 --> 00:53:44,326
<i>What's she saying?</i>

475
00:53:45,242 --> 00:53:46,659
Tekla, Tekla?

476
00:53:47,034 --> 00:53:49,617
<i>What's this Tekla, Mekla she's saying?</i>

477
00:53:49,784 --> 00:53:52,034
<i>She's looking
for her grandchild or something.</i>

478
00:53:52,784 --> 00:53:55,742
<i>Lady, there's no such girl here,
unfortunately.</i>

479
00:53:56,909 --> 00:53:58,492
<i>You're looking in vain.</i>

480
00:53:59,784 --> 00:54:01,492
<i>Do you speak Russian?</i>

481
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:05,909
<i>Girl, I think the lady is Russian.</i>

482
00:54:06,867 --> 00:54:10,367
<i>No, I don't know Russian.
I know a bit of Arabic.</i>

483
00:54:10,534 --> 00:54:12,159
- Batumi.
<i>- Batum?</i>

484
00:54:13,242 --> 00:54:14,492
<i>Georgian?</i>

485
00:54:14,826 --> 00:54:17,201
<i>- Oh, the lady is Georgian.
- Yes, Georgian.</i>

486
00:54:17,367 --> 00:54:20,617
<i>My grandfather was also Georgian.
He had the worst temper.</i>

487
00:54:21,409 --> 00:54:23,409
<i>There's no such person living here.</i>

488
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:28,117
<i>She's not taking it in.</i>

489
00:54:28,534 --> 00:54:32,242
<i>I'm telling you, she's Georgian.
My grandfather was the same.</i>

490
00:54:32,867 --> 00:54:34,617
<i>Isn't she sweet though?</i>

491
00:54:35,742 --> 00:54:38,951
<i>She's come all the way from Georgia
to search for her.</i>

492
00:54:40,534 --> 00:54:42,326
<i>What if our families
had looked for us?</i>

493
00:54:42,492 --> 00:54:45,742
<i>Are you crazy?
God forbid. Bite your tongue.</i>

494
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,492
<i>- Aynur?
- What?</i>

495
00:54:48,659 --> 00:54:50,742
<i>- Sing a song for us.
- Girl, stop it.</i>

496
00:54:50,909 --> 00:54:52,617
<i>Let the poor woman
hear your singing.</i>

497
00:54:52,784 --> 00:54:54,909
<i>Come on, now.
Just belt one out!</i>

498
00:54:58,117 --> 00:55:03,992
<i>I care nothing for the rose
That grows in the smoldering fire</i>

499
00:55:05,659 --> 00:55:12,242
<i>I know nothing of Arabic or Persian
I don't rely on speech</i>

500
00:55:13,201 --> 00:55:21,427
<i>I follow the rightful path
Of the gracious God</i>

501
00:55:22,659 --> 00:55:29,492
<i>I don't care for the path
Preached by the Devil</i>

502
00:55:29,742 --> 00:55:34,451
<i>I don't care for the path
Preached by the Devil</i>

503
00:55:36,826 --> 00:55:43,784
<i>I have the strangest disease
Everyone only cares about themselves</i>

504
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:52,909
<i>I eat what I find today
And God will help me tomorrow</i>

505
00:55:53,867 --> 00:56:01,826
<i>I don't covet
The riches of this world</i>

506
00:56:03,492 --> 00:56:09,951
<i>God is the one who sustains me
I don't bow down to mortals</i>

507
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:18,576
<i>God is the one who sustains me
I don't bow down to mortals</i>

508
00:57:11,492 --> 00:57:14,492
Where were you?
I've been waiting here all day.

509
00:57:17,117 --> 00:57:19,076
I'm sorry for last night.

510
00:57:20,034 --> 00:57:23,742
I went out for a walk last night,
thought I'd ask around for a job.

511
00:57:23,909 --> 00:57:28,367
Then I met some people from the hostel
and lost track of time.

512
00:57:29,617 --> 00:57:32,951
I have good news! I met a girl
who works for an organization.

513
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:35,201
She said she might be able to help us.

514
00:57:35,367 --> 00:57:37,826
- And I brought you something sweet.
- Thank you.

515
00:57:39,409 --> 00:57:42,951
I've been waiting here all day
to take you to that girl's office,

516
00:57:43,117 --> 00:57:44,742
but you never came...

517
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:48,076
I think they're closed now.

518
00:57:48,242 --> 00:57:52,742
Leave her address at the reception.
I'll go see the girl myself tomorrow.

519
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:55,826
I really just needed to get out.

520
00:57:55,992 --> 00:57:57,451
I'll do all I can to find Tekla.

521
00:57:57,617 --> 00:57:58,992
On my honor!

522
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:01,742
Your brother was right about you.

523
00:58:04,826 --> 00:58:07,867
Pack your things and leave.

524
00:58:12,909 --> 00:58:14,742
I don't have any things.

525
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,492
Well then.

526
00:58:20,742 --> 00:58:23,909
Go fuck yourself!

527
00:58:25,867 --> 00:58:28,367
You old fucking drunk!

528
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:39,242
Unbelievable...

529
01:00:05,867 --> 01:00:06,992
What?

530
01:00:09,576 --> 01:00:10,992
You hungry?

531
01:00:14,117 --> 01:00:15,409
I'm starving.

532
01:00:18,492 --> 01:00:19,742
Come on, then.

533
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:32,242
<i>Have a seat.
Would you like to see the menu?</i>

534
01:00:35,409 --> 01:00:38,367
<i>Hello, welcome.
Would you like to see the menu?</i>

535
01:00:47,742 --> 01:00:51,534
If we only get rice and potatoes,
it won't be too expensive.

536
01:00:59,909 --> 01:01:02,492
<i>Hello, would you like to see the menu?</i>

537
01:01:13,992 --> 01:01:17,367
Boy, I love the smell of cucumber.

538
01:01:21,826 --> 01:01:22,659
May I?

539
01:01:23,034 --> 01:01:25,242
Why are you even asking?

540
01:01:57,117 --> 01:01:58,117
Thank you.

541
01:02:00,909 --> 01:02:02,117
Pardon me?

542
01:02:02,534 --> 01:02:03,992
Are you Georgian?

543
01:02:04,659 --> 01:02:05,701
Yes.

544
01:02:05,867 --> 01:02:07,742
Are you here on vacation?

545
01:02:09,117 --> 01:02:10,367
Yes.

546
01:02:10,867 --> 01:02:13,826
I live here, running a business.

547
01:02:14,242 --> 01:02:15,867
This is Hasan.

548
01:02:16,367 --> 01:02:19,701
He's a local Georgian,
third generation from the Black Sea.

549
01:02:21,159 --> 01:02:23,867
What's this?
Is that all you're having?

550
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:28,617
Let me be your host.

551
01:02:28,784 --> 01:02:31,367
No, that won't be necessary.
Thank you.

552
01:02:32,617 --> 01:02:34,367
What are you drinking?

553
01:02:34,534 --> 01:02:36,117
We really are good.
Thank you.

554
01:02:36,284 --> 01:02:38,117
Have you ever tried raki?

555
01:02:38,826 --> 01:02:40,576
No, but thank you.

556
01:02:40,742 --> 01:02:41,867
<i>Garçon!</i>

557
01:02:46,784 --> 01:02:48,367
Smell how good this smells.

558
01:02:50,617 --> 01:02:52,784
Cheers.

559
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:07,909
I reckon it's your first time here?

560
01:03:09,784 --> 01:03:12,409
No, I was actually here as a child once.

561
01:03:12,576 --> 01:03:14,867
- Really?
- Yes. My father brought me here.

562
01:03:15,284 --> 01:03:18,909
It was that trip that inspired me

563
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:22,451
to become a history teacher.

564
01:03:23,617 --> 01:03:25,117
You teach history?

565
01:03:25,284 --> 01:03:27,784
I used to, I'm retired now.

566
01:03:30,034 --> 01:03:31,951
I'm so sorry, I need to leave.

567
01:03:32,784 --> 01:03:35,242
- Lovely meeting you.
- Likewise.

568
01:03:35,409 --> 01:03:36,742
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

569
01:03:39,534 --> 01:03:41,951
Is he your son?

570
01:03:43,534 --> 01:03:44,742
No...

571
01:03:45,284 --> 01:03:48,617
He's a friend of my niece.

572
01:03:51,367 --> 01:03:52,701
Cheers.

573
01:03:52,867 --> 01:03:56,117
To you, Ramaz!
Our Georgian brother in Istanbul!

574
01:03:56,284 --> 01:03:58,201
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

575
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,451
- He seems like a good boy.
- He is.

576
01:04:10,117 --> 01:04:13,076
<i>I combined the checks for both tables.</i>

577
01:04:13,242 --> 01:04:16,034
- Shouldn't we get going?
- Be polite.

578
01:04:16,409 --> 01:04:17,826
<i>That's fine.</i>

579
01:04:17,992 --> 01:04:20,159
Oh no, Mr. Ramaz, please don't...

580
01:04:21,284 --> 01:04:23,492
No worries, it's on me.

581
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:26,492
It's really too much.

582
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:30,659
How often do I meet Georgians
such as yourself?

583
01:04:35,284 --> 01:04:37,201
Do you have your own family?

584
01:04:38,492 --> 01:04:39,867
Only my niece.

585
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:43,409
What about...

586
01:04:44,097 --> 01:04:45,159
you?

587
01:04:45,909 --> 01:04:47,284
I used to.

588
01:04:48,034 --> 01:04:49,992
We separated ten years ago.

589
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:51,784
That's a pity.

590
01:04:52,617 --> 01:04:54,367
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

591
01:04:54,534 --> 01:04:57,201
<i>A rose for the lady?</i>

592
01:04:59,284 --> 01:05:00,326
<i>It would really suit you.</i>

593
01:05:08,284 --> 01:05:10,409
<i>Sir, I gave the lady a rose.</i>

594
01:05:17,367 --> 01:05:19,367
Please excuse me.

595
01:05:19,534 --> 01:05:21,034
I'll be right back.

596
01:05:23,784 --> 01:05:24,951
Are you kidding me?

597
01:05:25,367 --> 01:05:27,034
What are you on about?

598
01:05:27,742 --> 01:05:29,659
I know what I'm doing.

599
01:05:30,284 --> 01:05:31,534
Sure you do.

600
01:05:34,284 --> 01:05:35,117
Achi.

601
01:05:35,284 --> 01:05:38,992
Lia told me
you're looking for her niece.

602
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:41,117
Perhaps I could be of help?

603
01:05:41,284 --> 01:05:43,909
We could inquire
at the local Georgian church.

604
01:05:44,909 --> 01:05:47,742
Yes, I'm sure
they'll be super helpful...

605
01:07:12,992 --> 01:07:15,367
- Where is he?
- How should I know?

606
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:18,576
You scared him off?

607
01:07:18,742 --> 01:07:20,284
What did you tell him?

608
01:07:20,784 --> 01:07:22,867
Nothing. I just saw him leave.

609
01:07:23,034 --> 01:07:24,492
Tell me what you told him!

610
01:07:24,659 --> 01:07:26,034
What would I have told him?

611
01:07:26,201 --> 01:07:27,617
You shouldn't have let him go.

612
01:07:27,784 --> 01:07:30,992
- What was I supposed to do?
- He was going to help us!

613
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:34,367
What should I have done? Tie him down?
You scared him off!

614
01:07:58,159 --> 01:07:59,409
Are you Okay?

615
01:08:01,201 --> 01:08:02,867
I'm so sorry.

616
01:08:03,701 --> 01:08:05,784
I didn't mean for this to happen.

617
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:12,909
Do you know what a knockout I was
as a young girl?

618
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:17,908
Men threw themselves at me.

619
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:19,951
You're not so bad nowadays either.

620
01:08:20,117 --> 01:08:22,242
- You think?
- Sure.

621
01:08:23,826 --> 01:08:27,159
I was the best dancer
in the village, too.

622
01:08:37,534 --> 01:08:38,534
<i>Here.</i>

623
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:43,534
<i>Does it work?</i>

624
01:08:46,409 --> 01:08:48,326
<i>- Should I cut my hair?
- Yes.</i>

625
01:09:42,617 --> 01:09:44,117
<i>Alright now, thank you.</i>

626
01:09:47,451 --> 01:09:50,117
<i>Come on kids, enough now.</i>

627
01:09:50,284 --> 01:09:52,659
<i>Move along, now.</i>

628
01:09:55,201 --> 01:09:57,034
<i>So I don't know what to do...</i>

629
01:09:57,201 --> 01:10:00,867
<i>Come over to my place
and I'll help you solve it.</i>

630
01:10:01,034 --> 01:10:03,326
<i>Don't look now.
I said don't look now!</i>

631
01:10:03,492 --> 01:10:05,659
<i>It's the driver I mentioned.</i>

632
01:10:08,742 --> 01:10:10,117
<i>Oh my god, he's coming over!</i>

633
01:10:10,284 --> 01:10:12,659
<i>Bitch, relax,
maybe he's coming over for me.</i>

634
01:10:13,826 --> 01:10:15,367
<i>Plus he's barely a taxi driver.</i>

635
01:10:15,534 --> 01:10:16,617
<i>Hi.</i>

636
01:10:17,617 --> 01:10:18,742
<i>Hey.</i>

637
01:10:20,992 --> 01:10:22,742
<i>I wanted to give you my card.</i>

638
01:10:22,909 --> 01:10:25,284
<i>In case you need a ride.</i>

639
01:10:27,992 --> 01:10:30,367
<i>Oh, that's nice of you. Thanks.</i>

640
01:10:31,409 --> 01:10:34,076
<i>- Are you on night shift?
- My shift is almost over.</i>

641
01:10:34,242 --> 01:10:36,659
<i>I need to sleep,
I've got an exam tomorrow.</i>

642
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:40,159
<i>Exam? Are you a student for real?</i>

643
01:10:40,826 --> 01:10:43,242
<i>Yes. I'm going to be a teacher.</i>

644
01:10:43,409 --> 01:10:44,992
<i>My parents are teachers too.</i>

645
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:46,034
<i>That's awesome.</i>

646
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:47,617
<i>What kind of teacher?</i>

647
01:10:48,117 --> 01:10:51,117
<i>- Geography.
- That's nice. I like geography.</i>

648
01:10:57,534 --> 01:10:59,992
<i>Alright then.
I'll see you around?</i>

649
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:01,367
<i>See you.</i>

650
01:11:06,326 --> 01:11:08,034
<i>He's got a fine ass too.</i>

651
01:11:08,201 --> 01:11:09,867
<i>Bitch, he eye-fucked you.</i>

652
01:11:10,034 --> 01:11:13,742
<i>No, come on!
He's just looking for customers.</i>

653
01:11:13,909 --> 01:11:15,034
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

654
01:11:32,201 --> 01:11:33,992
<i>You're not picking up my calls.</i>

655
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:35,617
<i>Go fuck yourself.</i>

656
01:11:35,784 --> 01:11:38,284
<i>Baby, I'm here now, aren't I?</i>

657
01:11:47,701 --> 01:11:49,992
<i>Take me to breakfast tomorrow?</i>

658
01:11:50,576 --> 01:11:51,909
<i>Of course, baby.</i>

659
01:12:09,076 --> 01:12:10,284
<i>What?</i>

660
01:12:12,659 --> 01:12:14,534
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

661
01:12:17,034 --> 01:12:18,534
<i>Now?</i>

662
01:12:20,951 --> 01:12:23,826
<i>I just went to bed.
Wait one second.</i>

663
01:12:27,159 --> 01:12:28,701
<i>Did you call Şevval?</i>

664
01:12:30,076 --> 01:12:31,242
<i>What about Ahmet?</i>

665
01:12:32,576 --> 01:12:35,451
<i>Alright, I'll go. Hang up.</i>

666
01:12:40,326 --> 01:12:42,034
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

667
01:12:57,201 --> 01:12:59,159
<i>Long time no see!</i>

668
01:12:59,326 --> 01:13:00,867
<i>We missed you.</i>

669
01:13:01,034 --> 01:13:02,992
<i>What's wrong?
Wanna get locked up again?</i>

670
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:04,909
<i>I'm here as a representative.</i>

671
01:13:06,742 --> 01:13:08,159
<i>A representative?</i>

672
01:13:08,326 --> 01:13:11,451
<i>You're keeping somebody here
under false pretenses.</i>

673
01:13:13,451 --> 01:13:15,201
<i>Is this some kind of joke?</i>

674
01:13:16,076 --> 01:13:18,159
<i>You're supposed to be a lawyer now?</i>

675
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:20,951
<i>- I have a degree.
- A degree?</i>

676
01:13:21,701 --> 01:13:23,076
<i>She's got a degree, she says.</i>

677
01:13:23,992 --> 01:13:26,617
<i>So where did you graduate from?
The circus?</i>

678
01:13:26,784 --> 01:13:28,576
<i>Istanbul University.</i>

679
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:30,451
<i>Istanbul University?</i>

680
01:13:31,451 --> 01:13:32,534
<i>I bet you did...</i>

681
01:13:32,701 --> 01:13:34,909
<i>Go ahead then.
Show us your ID.</i>

682
01:13:35,076 --> 01:13:36,534
<i>I don't have it just yet.</i>

683
01:13:37,201 --> 01:13:39,367
<i>I'm just waiting
to get in front of a judge.</i>

684
01:13:39,534 --> 01:13:41,201
<i>It'll be any day now.</i>

685
01:13:42,784 --> 01:13:45,451
<i>- So you're not a lawyer then, are you?
- Listen...</i>

686
01:13:45,617 --> 01:13:47,909
<i>- Get over here.
- Here's your order.</i>

687
01:13:48,284 --> 01:13:49,617
<i>Why is this cold again?</i>

688
01:13:49,784 --> 01:13:51,159
<i>I'm a volunteer for Pink Life.</i>

689
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:52,992
<i>Somebody's here
under false pretenses.</i>

690
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:54,784
<i>Under false pretenses?</i>

691
01:13:54,951 --> 01:13:57,076
<i>Who's this somebody
we're keeping here?</i>

692
01:13:59,326 --> 01:14:00,951
<i>Izzet Yilmaz.</i>

693
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:03,242
<i>Izzet Yilmaz?</i>

694
01:14:04,451 --> 01:14:06,867
<i>And what business is he to you?</i>

695
01:14:07,034 --> 01:14:09,409
<i>I know his mother, Firuze.</i>

696
01:14:09,576 --> 01:14:11,159
<i>Tell her to come pick up her kid.</i>

697
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:13,367
<i>His mother's out of town.</i>

698
01:14:13,534 --> 01:14:14,909
<i>Meanwhile, he's in my care.</i>

699
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:18,159
<i>On what grounds are you detaining him?</i>

700
01:14:19,992 --> 01:14:21,492
<i>He tried to steal from a tourist.</i>

701
01:14:22,201 --> 01:14:24,909
<i>- Did you catch him in the act?
- No...</i>

702
01:14:25,076 --> 01:14:27,201
<i>Did he have any money on him?</i>

703
01:14:27,826 --> 01:14:30,076
<i>How would I know?</i>

704
01:14:30,826 --> 01:14:33,117
<i>Well then,
you can't actually detain him.</i>

705
01:14:33,784 --> 01:14:36,784
<i>We're not detaining him.
He's going to the orphanage.</i>

706
01:14:37,117 --> 01:14:40,159
<i>Not as long as his mother is around
to take care of him.</i>

707
01:14:40,326 --> 01:14:43,201
<i>If you want, I can call his mother.</i>

708
01:14:44,326 --> 01:14:47,326
<i>Besides, he'll just walk
straight out of the orphanage.</i>

709
01:14:48,576 --> 01:14:50,701
<i>Fine. Go sit and wait.</i>

710
01:14:53,701 --> 01:14:56,326
<i>So much for a peaceful lunch!</i>

711
01:15:03,951 --> 01:15:06,451
<i>- You didn't sign anything, right?
- No.</i>

712
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:10,284
<i>Can I have one?</i>

713
01:15:10,451 --> 01:15:11,951
<i>Don't be silly.</i>

714
01:15:16,076 --> 01:15:16,784
<i>Who's this?</i>

715
01:15:16,951 --> 01:15:19,034
<i>Gülpembe, I'm watching her
while her brother's gone.</i>

716
01:15:19,201 --> 01:15:20,701
<i>Where's her brother?</i>

717
01:15:21,076 --> 01:15:22,326
<i>In Malatya.</i>

718
01:15:23,451 --> 01:15:24,867
<i>Go on, wake her up.</i>

719
01:15:25,034 --> 01:15:26,534
<i>Gülpembe, wake up.</i>

720
01:15:26,701 --> 01:15:28,701
<i>Come on, wake up.</i>

721
01:15:30,076 --> 01:15:31,409
<i>Get up.</i>

722
01:15:33,034 --> 01:15:34,701
<i>Come on now, hurry up.</i>

723
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:39,909
<i>Take her hand.</i>

724
01:15:42,451 --> 01:15:43,909
<i>Where'd you get that saz?</i>

725
01:15:44,076 --> 01:15:45,784
<i>I borrowed it from a friend.</i>

726
01:15:45,951 --> 01:15:47,451
<i>Sure you did.</i>

727
01:16:25,576 --> 01:16:27,117
What are you doing?

728
01:16:27,284 --> 01:16:28,159
Nothing.

729
01:16:28,326 --> 01:16:30,326
You thought I was dead?

730
01:16:30,701 --> 01:16:31,826
No.

731
01:16:32,534 --> 01:16:36,076
Your breath smells like shit.
It brought me back to life.

732
01:16:53,534 --> 01:16:54,867
I want to tell you something.

733
01:16:58,909 --> 01:17:01,951
What ever happened to your mother,
by the way?

734
01:17:03,951 --> 01:17:05,326
What do you mean?

735
01:17:06,576 --> 01:17:09,451
You told me your mother lives here.

736
01:17:10,701 --> 01:17:11,617
I did?

737
01:17:11,784 --> 01:17:14,201
Don't you remember?
Back in Batumi.

738
01:17:14,826 --> 01:17:16,159
Oh, yeah.

739
01:17:17,326 --> 01:17:19,409
She came here for work
when I was a kid.

740
01:17:19,576 --> 01:17:22,451
But after a while
she sort of disappeared.

741
01:17:24,034 --> 01:17:24,909
But...

742
01:17:26,826 --> 01:17:28,284
I think...

743
01:17:29,451 --> 01:17:32,201
She died
and they didn't want to tell me.

744
01:17:33,451 --> 01:17:35,659
She never would've just left me.

745
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:40,701
Of course not.

746
01:17:41,826 --> 01:17:43,451
I think so too.

747
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,701
Especially not with my fat half-brother.

748
01:17:50,826 --> 01:17:52,326
You know what?

749
01:17:54,326 --> 01:17:56,451
It seems Istanbul is a place

750
01:17:57,784 --> 01:17:59,701
where people come

751
01:18:02,534 --> 01:18:03,826
to disappear.

752
01:18:08,034 --> 01:18:09,659
<i>What did you do to your hair?</i>

753
01:18:10,076 --> 01:18:13,076
<i>I found a hair clipper,
had to check if it worked.</i>

754
01:18:13,409 --> 01:18:14,784
<i>Idiot.</i>

755
01:18:15,909 --> 01:18:17,576
<i>Why aren't you in school?</i>

756
01:18:21,034 --> 01:18:22,909
<i>When's your mother coming back?</i>

757
01:18:23,076 --> 01:18:24,326
<i>Don't know.</i>

758
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,242
<i>How long has it been this time?</i>

759
01:18:27,409 --> 01:18:28,701
<i>Not too long.</i>

760
01:18:31,576 --> 01:18:34,159
<i>So, you're a pickpocket now?</i>

761
01:18:34,326 --> 01:18:35,451
<i>No, I'm not!</i>

762
01:18:36,534 --> 01:18:39,992
<i>If they catch you again
and your mom's not around, I can't help.</i>

763
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:41,784
<i>She'll be back soon.</i>

764
01:18:44,909 --> 01:18:47,826
<i>Come here. You'll catch a cold.</i>

765
01:18:49,784 --> 01:18:50,951
<i>Sit straight.</i>

766
01:18:57,909 --> 01:19:01,826
I must've eaten something bad
last night.

767
01:19:02,284 --> 01:19:04,451
Sure, that's what it is.

768
01:19:06,034 --> 01:19:08,034
Is this place far?

769
01:19:08,201 --> 01:19:10,701
We have to cross to the other side.

770
01:19:16,867 --> 01:19:20,201
<i>I'm gonna look so cool!
Thanks, Evrim.</i>

771
01:19:34,034 --> 01:19:36,826
<i>Did you pick out your hairstyle?</i>

772
01:19:38,284 --> 01:19:40,284
<i>Girl, who are you flirting with?</i>

773
01:19:40,451 --> 01:19:43,909
<i>You're disgracing the salon!
You little floozy!</i>

774
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:45,784
<i>I know them!</i>

775
01:19:45,951 --> 01:19:48,326
<i>He and his grandma
are looking for a trans girl!</i>

776
01:19:54,409 --> 01:19:56,909
<i>- I hope you're not scamming these people.
- No.</i>

777
01:19:57,076 --> 01:19:58,284
<i>I just showed them the way.</i>

778
01:19:58,451 --> 01:19:59,534
<i>I'm like a guide.</i>

779
01:19:59,701 --> 01:20:01,076
<i>Alright then.</i>

780
01:20:07,451 --> 01:20:08,867
<i>Izzet, go get us some tea.</i>

781
01:20:11,451 --> 01:20:12,951
Is she trans too?

782
01:20:13,701 --> 01:20:15,326
How should I know?

783
01:20:19,826 --> 01:20:21,326
She says she's trans.

784
01:20:33,784 --> 01:20:35,201
<i>She could be anywhere.</i>

785
01:20:35,367 --> 01:20:38,159
<i>And how do we know
if she even wants to be found?</i>

786
01:20:38,326 --> 01:20:41,409
<i>Evrim, do we know
who they actually are to the girl?</i>

787
01:20:43,826 --> 01:20:45,409
What are they saying?

788
01:20:57,326 --> 01:20:58,534
- What?
- One second.

789
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,326
<i>What do you think?</i>

790
01:21:13,867 --> 01:21:14,742
<i>On the other hand,</i>

791
01:21:14,909 --> 01:21:16,742
<i>she has the right to know
someone's looking for her.</i>

792
01:21:17,201 --> 01:21:18,951
<i>If she's even in Istanbul.</i>

793
01:21:20,451 --> 01:21:21,951
<i>Attention, friends!</i>

794
01:21:22,617 --> 01:21:26,534
<i>Does anyone know of a Georgian girl
who goes by the name of Tekla?</i>

795
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:28,534
<i>I might've heard her name.</i>

796
01:21:29,326 --> 01:21:30,242
<i>Where?</i>

797
01:21:30,409 --> 01:21:33,034
<i>You know the girls
living in Ceylan's apartment?</i>

798
01:21:33,201 --> 01:21:35,284
<i>Yes, I was there the other day.</i>

799
01:21:35,451 --> 01:21:36,659
<i>Are you sure?</i>

800
01:21:36,826 --> 01:21:38,242
<i>Not one hundred percent,</i>

801
01:21:38,576 --> 01:21:40,451
<i>but it sounds familiar.</i>

802
01:21:41,367 --> 01:21:42,492
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>

803
01:21:44,451 --> 01:21:45,909
Do they know her?

804
01:21:46,076 --> 01:21:47,992
I dunno,
I don't speak Turkish that well.

805
01:21:52,784 --> 01:21:55,076
She says they're not sure.

806
01:21:57,159 --> 01:21:58,909
But she can take us there.

807
01:22:16,909 --> 01:22:19,367
Ask her
if it's hard to walk in such high heels.

808
01:22:19,951 --> 01:22:21,826
I can't ask her that.

809
01:22:21,992 --> 01:22:23,326
Ask her.

810
01:22:38,534 --> 01:22:41,326
- What did she say?
- That they're comfortable.

811
01:22:41,826 --> 01:22:43,701
I could never.

812
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:20,284
<i>Ah, Turkey's hottest lawyer!</i>

813
01:23:20,451 --> 01:23:21,701
<i>Welcome, love.</i>

814
01:23:21,867 --> 01:23:22,909
<i>Hello.</i>

815
01:23:23,076 --> 01:23:24,159
<i>Who are they?</i>

816
01:23:24,326 --> 01:23:28,576
<i>They're looking for a girl named Tekla.</i>

817
01:23:28,909 --> 01:23:30,909
<i>I'll take you to Mother then.</i>

818
01:23:31,076 --> 01:23:32,492
<i>May I offer you some tea?</i>

819
01:23:33,451 --> 01:23:35,909
<i>Apologies for disturbing you like this.</i>

820
01:23:36,076 --> 01:23:37,284
<i>Not at all.</i>

821
01:23:37,451 --> 01:23:40,617
<i>You've been very helpful
with those nasty tenants.</i>

822
01:23:41,576 --> 01:23:42,992
<i>We brought you sweets.</i>

823
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:45,284
<i>Thank you.</i>

824
01:23:46,034 --> 01:23:46,992
<i>Girls!</i>

825
01:23:47,701 --> 01:23:49,742
<i>Serve our guests some tea!</i>

826
01:23:49,909 --> 01:23:51,951
<i>And keep it down in there!</i>

827
01:23:52,117 --> 01:23:53,034
<i>Not a noise!</i>

828
01:23:53,201 --> 01:23:54,826
<i>Yes, Mother, right away.</i>

829
01:23:57,409 --> 01:24:00,159
<i>We're actually here
to ask about a Georgian girl.</i>

830
01:24:00,326 --> 01:24:02,284
<i>Tekla is her name.</i>

831
01:24:05,076 --> 01:24:07,076
<i>Oh, darling...</i>

832
01:24:07,951 --> 01:24:10,076
<i>Many Georgian girls
have come through here.</i>

833
01:24:10,451 --> 01:24:13,534
<i>All of them stuck-up,
noses in the air.</i>

834
01:24:13,701 --> 01:24:16,826
<i>I was told she might be living here.</i>

835
01:24:18,326 --> 01:24:19,201
<i>No.</i>

836
01:24:19,659 --> 01:24:21,284
What are they saying?

837
01:24:24,326 --> 01:24:27,076
<i>Do you have any idea
where she might be?</i>

838
01:24:27,534 --> 01:24:29,534
<i>All my girls have tried to find her.</i>

839
01:24:30,034 --> 01:24:33,576
<i>Her phone's turned off.
It's like she disappeared into thin air.</i>

840
01:24:35,326 --> 01:24:37,451
<i>Careful.</i>

841
01:24:38,659 --> 01:24:40,867
<i>You know how it is
with these girls and drugs.</i>

842
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:43,284
<i>They go down that road,
there's no return.</i>

843
01:24:44,076 --> 01:24:46,701
<i>Strictly forbidden in my house...</i>

844
01:24:47,242 --> 01:24:51,701
<i>If you ask me, she probably left Turkey.</i>

845
01:24:54,701 --> 01:24:55,951
<i>Is this her family?</i>

846
01:24:58,201 --> 01:24:59,784
<i>This is her aunt</i>

847
01:24:59,951 --> 01:25:01,576
<i>and that's her friend.</i>

848
01:25:02,409 --> 01:25:06,409
<i>She left a few of her belongings.</i>

849
01:25:06,576 --> 01:25:08,576
<i>They can take them if they like.</i>

850
01:25:12,451 --> 01:25:14,492
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

851
01:25:14,659 --> 01:25:16,159
<i>Of course.</i>

852
01:26:44,659 --> 01:26:46,951
- I want to tell you something.
- What is it?

853
01:26:50,326 --> 01:26:53,534
I never actually had her address.

854
01:26:54,201 --> 01:26:58,326
I googled "Trans women in Istanbul"
and showed it to you.

855
01:27:01,076 --> 01:27:02,784
I knew it all along.

856
01:27:10,076 --> 01:27:11,284
<i>- Hey, Murat.
- Hello.</i>

857
01:27:11,451 --> 01:27:12,909
<i>Is there a wedding tonight?</i>

858
01:27:13,076 --> 01:27:15,242
<i>Yes, but I can seat you in the back.</i>

859
01:27:15,409 --> 01:27:17,826
<i>- Maybe I'll see you dance a little too.
- Alright, thanks.</i>

860
01:28:13,451 --> 01:28:14,826
Go on.

861
01:32:00,576 --> 01:32:01,826
<i>You hungry?</i>

862
01:32:03,201 --> 01:32:04,451
<i>Always.</i>

863
01:32:07,242 --> 01:32:08,701
<i>Wanna get breakfast?</i>

864
01:32:09,576 --> 01:32:10,826
<i>Why not?</i>

865
01:32:11,367 --> 01:32:12,534
<i>Let's go then.</i>

866
01:32:24,534 --> 01:32:27,284
Will you go back to Batumi with me?

867
01:32:33,201 --> 01:32:34,951
I'll stay here.

868
01:32:37,659 --> 01:32:40,951
They said there could be work for me
at the hostel.

869
01:34:16,659 --> 01:34:17,951
Auntie?

870
01:34:20,826 --> 01:34:22,076
Auntie!

871
01:34:31,951 --> 01:34:33,076
Tekla?

872
01:35:08,576 --> 01:35:10,576
You look just like your mother.

873
01:35:12,326 --> 01:35:14,701
Is it really you?

874
01:35:22,451 --> 01:35:24,701
How do you like my garden?

875
01:35:26,326 --> 01:35:28,367
I did everything
the way you taught me.

876
01:35:29,159 --> 01:35:32,909
I have a few tomatoes.
Some tiny cucumbers.

877
01:35:33,076 --> 01:35:34,742
How's our garden doing?

878
01:35:34,909 --> 01:35:36,826
I didn't have time to tend it.

879
01:35:41,576 --> 01:35:43,076
That's a pity.

880
01:35:44,076 --> 01:35:46,451
Who lives here with you?

881
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:49,534
It's my boyfriend's apartment.

882
01:35:50,034 --> 01:35:51,826
He owns the hair salon downstairs.

883
01:35:52,326 --> 01:35:54,951
Do you remember
how I used to cut everyone's hair?

884
01:35:55,659 --> 01:35:58,659
You need to cut and dye your hair.

885
01:36:22,284 --> 01:36:24,576
Go on, what would you tell her?

886
01:36:33,159 --> 01:36:34,826
I would tell her...

887
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:40,492
that we failed her.

888
01:36:40,659 --> 01:36:42,659
Her mother and I.

889
01:36:45,201 --> 01:36:48,076
We did nothing for her.

890
01:36:50,826 --> 01:36:53,159
We lost so much time.

891
01:36:56,534 --> 01:37:00,534
We only cared about
what people would say about us.

892
01:37:02,326 --> 01:37:04,534
That's what I would tell her.

893
01:37:12,326 --> 01:37:13,909
I would tell her...

894
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:21,034
that her mother loved her very much.

895
01:37:23,451 --> 01:37:25,826
In spite of everything.

896
01:37:31,659 --> 01:37:33,201
I would tell her...

897
01:37:36,326 --> 01:37:38,659
that I love her a lot too.

898
01:38:00,451 --> 01:38:02,076
I will stay here.

899
01:38:04,534 --> 01:38:07,076
And keep searching until I find you.

900
01:38:08,659 --> 01:38:10,117
I know you will.

901
01:38:13,076 --> 01:38:16,076
<i>Attention passengers.
This ferry is heading back to</i>

902
01:38:16,242 --> 01:38:19,451
<i>Eminönü and Karaköy.</i>
