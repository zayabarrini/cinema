1
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:33,395
Hi.

2
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,522
Hi. I'm Ani.

3
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:38,984
No?
You waiting for someone else?

4
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:41,278
All right. Are you sure?

5
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:43,363
Okay.

6
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,916
Hello!

7
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,851
- Hi! How are you?
- Hello.

8
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:50,095
- Hi. I'm Ani.
- Pleased to meet you.

9
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,081
- Very nice to meet you.
- Yes.

10
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:54,041
- How you doing?
- I'm doing well.

11
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,560
- Yeah?
- Thank you. Oh, quite lovely.

12
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,247
You can sit right there, okay?

13
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:09,832
Okay.

14
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:14,193
Do you still talk to your family?
Do they know you do this?

15
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:15,153
Mm-hmm.

16
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:16,847
- They do? They're okay with it?
- Yeah.

17
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:18,482
I'd be okay.

18
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:20,050
Does your family know
you're here?

19
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:21,801
- I hope not.
- Yeah?

20
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,530
- Hi. I'm Ani.
- Nice to meet you, Ani.

21
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:25,948
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Ricky.

22
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:26,932
- Ricky?
- Yeah.

23
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,993
Hi. Nice to meet you.
I'll just sit right next to you right here.

24
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:31,628
- Oh, yeah.
- Very cozy, right?

25
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:33,063
Pretty serious.

26
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,881
- Yeah.
- A lot of work, but, you know...

27
00:03:34,906 --> 00:03:36,742
- ...that's why I'm here.
- You're a hard worker?

28
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:38,018
Chill out and come here,
you know?

29
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:40,863
Yeah, well, we could go
chill out in a private room.

30
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,016
All right, lucky number six.

31
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,985
That's my number.

32
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,188
Thank you. Oh.

33
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:55,210
Yeah.

34
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:00,883
- Ani?
- Yeah.

35
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,401
When Robert was here
the other night,

36
00:04:02,426 --> 00:04:04,053
did he ask you for a dance?

37
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,362
Yeah.

38
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:06,847
And you danced with him?

39
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:08,558
Yeah.

40
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,301
Okay.

41
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:12,094
- Okay.
- Okay.

42
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,105
Bitch.

43
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,302
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

44
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:32,097
He was really weird.

45
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:33,765
Super weird.

46
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,417
- Like, serial killer weird?
- Like, he would rub...

47
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,152
Yeah, like, he was like
Indian Jeffrey Dahmer,

48
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:39,805
- and he kept, like, rubbing my leg...
- Oh, no.

49
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,481
...in a circle like that.

50
00:04:41,607 --> 00:04:43,000
What is that?
Is that a butterfly?

51
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:44,902
- Yeah, it's a butterfly.
- You're so classy.

52
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,036
I know.

53
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:48,305
I got dollar signs
like a real ho.

54
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,365
No, but you're manifesting
with those.

55
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,144
He said I looked like
his 18-year-old daughter.

56
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,147
And then he bought
five dances from me.

57
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,827
That's fucking disgusting.

58
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:03,929
Well, at least
he bought the dances.

59
00:05:04,254 --> 00:05:05,180
Yeah.

60
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,059
- You can touch me. It's okay.
- Yeah?

61
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,829
I'll build you a belt.

62
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,147
Yeah, make me a belt.

63
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:23,574
A money belt?

64
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:26,651
You don't have cash?
Let's go to the ATM.

65
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:28,553
You want to go
to the ATM right now?

66
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,021
- Well, I can't spend too much.
- Yeah, okay.

67
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:31,340
- Let's go to the ATM.
- Great.

68
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,158
Let's go get you some cash.

69
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,204
Seriously, he came out
of the bathroom one time,

70
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:38,856
and he didn't zip up
his fucking pants.

71
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,215
It's like, if you can't zip up

72
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,884
your fucking pants
after you take a piss,

73
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,994
I don't trust you
with the music.

74
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,362
Dude, he's 40.

75
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,130
He's literally geriatric.

76
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:48,632
- No, I know. It's like...
- Ani.

77
00:05:48,657 --> 00:05:51,160
I got a kid who wants someone
who speaks Russian.

78
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,879
You know, Jimmy, the girls
and I have been talking,

79
00:05:54,004 --> 00:05:58,216
and if your cousin doesn't
start showing us some respect...

80
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,236
- ...we're not gonna tip out anymore.
- All right. I'll talk to him.

81
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,013
Who are you talking about,
the DJ?

82
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:05,007
- All right, seriously?
- He's an asshole.

83
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,617
I shared my playlist with him,

84
00:06:06,842 --> 00:06:08,452
and he was very rude
and dismissive.

85
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:09,645
You're killing me.

86
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,205
Let's go. Come on.

87
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,964
No. No, I'm eating my food.

88
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,459
That's why you have Tupperware.
To keep things fresh.

89
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:16,894
- She's eating.
- He's a spender.

90
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,670
- Come on. Let's go.
- Come on. What the fuck.

91
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,672
Time is money, baby.
Get a roll on it.

92
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,549
Without pants, without nothing.

93
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,218
And then some...

94
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,720
- Hey, guys.
- Then... One second, bro.

95
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,466
Guys...

96
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,581
Guys...

97
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:31,417
- Hello! This is the beautiful Ani.
- Wow.

98
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:34,394
She's gonna take care of
everything you need tonight.

99
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,455
Ani, make me proud.

100
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,374
Yeah. I'm... Yeah.

101
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,151
(in Russian): You are beautiful.

102
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,488
(in English): Um, I'm, uh, uh,
Ivan, and...

103
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,032
(in Russian): But you can
call me Vanya.

104
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,358
- (in English): Vanya. Okay.
- Yeah.

105
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:49,693
Nice to meet you, Vanya.

106
00:06:49,718 --> 00:06:51,803
(in Russian): And this is
my best friend...

107
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:54,423
(in English): Uh, fucking
best friend, Tom.

108
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,041
- Hi. I'm Ani.
- What's up?

109
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:58,836
You're not bad. Uh, and, uh...

110
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:02,297
(in Russian): I heard
you speak Russian, right?

111
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,383
(in English): Mm. No, I don't
speak Russian,

112
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,135
but I know Russian.

113
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:07,886
(in Russian): What do you mean?

114
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,173
(in English): I can speak Russian.

115
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:12,824
I just prefer not to,

116
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,060
but you can go ahead
and speak Russian.

117
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,270
I'll understand.

118
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:18,163
Uh, I not understand.

119
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,807
What the fuck?

120
00:07:21,617 --> 00:07:22,910
Um...

121
00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:25,087
- Okay.
- Yeah.

122
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,064
(in Russian): Hello, Ivan.

123
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:28,757
(speaks Russian)

124
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,784
(in Russian): My name is Ani.

125
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,329
This is how I speak Russian.

126
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,458
Do you still want me
to speak Russian?

127
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,918
Fuck yeah!

128
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,087
(in English): No, it's...
My Russian is terrible.

129
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,505
I can't even roll my R's.

130
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,799
No, no, you-you are not bad, really.

131
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,177
You are not bad in Russian.
Your Russian is great, great.

132
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,386
- Really? Okay.
- Yeah.

133
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,305
Well, I disagree,
but thank you.

134
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,641
Yeah. And, uh,
how do you know Russian?

135
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,896
My grandmother never
learned English, so...

136
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,023
Ah. Uh-huh.

137
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,399
- Yeah.
- But enough about me.

138
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,067
You two are from Russia?

139
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:07,070
Yeah, I'm from Russia,
uh, but he lives here.

140
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,739
Yeah.

141
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:10,532
Mm.

142
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,910
Oh, so you're on vacation or...

143
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:14,653
Mm, yeah, vacation.

144
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:16,221
I guess you can say that. Yeah.

145
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,956
But I'm speaking, uh...

146
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,667
(in Russian): May I switch to Russian?

147
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,794
- (in English): Yeah? Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Whatever you want.

148
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,721
Yeah, because my English
sounds terrible.

149
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,748
- At all, yeah.
- No, no, no.

150
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,734
- Your English is really good.
- Yeah.

151
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,179
(in Russian): And that's why
I think we should toast

152
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,389
to our fucking bad accents

153
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,059
with a bottle.

154
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,021
(in English): Yeah. And you want
to go to VIP, maybe?

155
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,981
Yeah, excellent. I want.

156
00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:48,505
Oh.

157
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,158
(in Russian): You work
in a cool place.

158
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,026
(in English): Yeah, it's a cool place.

159
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:57,112
And the room I'm bringing
you to is really nice.

160
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,489
Mm-hmm.

161
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,333
- Wow. Mm.
- Right in there.

162
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,129
- Mm.
- You're very good, really.

163
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,802
And one more. Yeah.

164
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:14,897
Thank you.

165
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,102
Where are you going?

166
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,671
No, I'm not going anywhere.

167
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,191
Can you sit on your hands
for me?

168
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,277
- What?
- Sit on your hands.

169
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,654
- Hands under your legs.
- Like...

170
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,272
Mm-hmm.

171
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,038
(in Russian): This is not allowed.

172
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,999
But I like you.

173
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,253
(in English): God bless America.

174
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,254
(in Russian): Here's to having a
hard dick and lots of money.

175
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:05,655
Um...

176
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,685
I want to ask.
Do you work outside the club?

177
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,690
(in English): Give me your phone.

178
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:55,965
Yo.

179
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,192
Yo. Yo. Did you pick up milk?

180
00:11:01,636 --> 00:11:03,847
Do you see milk in the fridge?

181
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:05,123
No.

182
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,501
Then I didn't pick up
the fucking milk.

183
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:08,827
Wonderful.

184
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:10,145
Thank you.

185
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,948
Hi. Uh, I'm here
for Mr. Zakharov.

186
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,866
- Ivan?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

187
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,146
Hi. Hello. What's up?

188
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:10,605
- Uh...
- Hi.

189
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,899
Come in. Come in, please.

190
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:17,303
Mm, so welcome
to my humble abode.

191
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,198
- Hugs.
- Oh, yes.

192
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,950
Hugs.

193
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,618
I can help you.

194
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,912
- Mm.
- Oh. Thank you.

195
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,832
Ooh, you-you look beautiful.

196
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,792
- Awesome.
- Aw. Thank you.

197
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,586
(in Russian): Want something to
drink?

198
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,422
(in English): Uh, yeah,
I'll-I'll take a water.

199
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,299
- Water? Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

200
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,800
You can take everything
you want.

201
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,927
Vodka, tequila, whiskey,
whiskey cola.

202
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,387
Coca-Cola, maybe?

203
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,930
No, a water's good.

204
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,640
- Yeah, thank you.
- Uh-huh.

205
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,268
Suit yourself, Ani.

206
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,562
Uh, sparkling or flat water?

207
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,565
Um, either is good.

208
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,902
Oh...

209
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,570
(in Russian): Where's the
fucking water?

210
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,988
Wow.

211
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,700
(in English): Not too shabby.

212
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,911
What is "shabby"?

213
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,829
Oh, I'm-I'm just playing.

214
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,700
I meant,
your home is-is beautiful.

215
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,127
My home is okay, girl.

216
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:15,912
Um, sparkling.

217
00:13:15,937 --> 00:13:17,355
Thank you.

218
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,829
Bedroom's upstairs.

219
00:13:20,353 --> 00:13:21,200
Let's go.

220
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:23,695
Okay.

221
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,350
Oh, sorry.
I am waiting for you.

222
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,051
Oh.

223
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,170
I'll hurry up.

224
00:13:34,864 --> 00:13:36,474
They didn't make my bed yet.

225
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:38,293
(in Russian): Fuck.
Is it so difficult?

226
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,462
Sorry.

227
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,656
(in English): Whoa.

228
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,411
Nice view.

229
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:51,439
My view's better.

230
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,420
Okay.
So, what are you looking for?

231
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,714
Um, sex.

232
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,884
Yeah, I know.

233
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,887
I mean, like, anything special?

234
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,531
Yeah, special sex.

235
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,601
- Special sex.
- Mm-hmm.

236
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:12,978
Okay.

237
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,355
So, like, a little bit
of everything?

238
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,899
A little bit of...

239
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,610
(in Russian): Yes! Sounds
fucking amazing!

240
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:23,129
(in English): You want to take
your clothes off?

241
00:14:23,354 --> 00:14:24,656
Yeah.

242
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:37,260
Wow. Okay.

243
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:42,332
- You want to put this on?
- Hmm?

244
00:14:42,357 --> 00:14:44,901
Or do you want me
to put it on for you?

245
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,487
- Faster.
- Mm-hmm.

246
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,514
Faster, faster.

247
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,891
- Faster. Faster. Faster.
- Mm-hmm.

248
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,310
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- Okay.

249
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,228
- So you want me to stop?
- Stop, stop, stop!

250
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,813
- I said...
- Okay.

251
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,891
Want you?

252
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,595
Oh, uh, sure.

253
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,873
S-S-S-Sure.

254
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,417
But be careful
with that shit, yeah?

255
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:18,444
Careful.

256
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,692
And that's for you.
Tip.

257
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,969
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

258
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,055
That's very generous of you.

259
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,307
And I want to say
one more thing.

260
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:33,691
Yes.

261
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:35,593
It was really amazing.

262
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,105
Oh, oh, oh.

263
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,525
I love these guys.
You know them?

264
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:44,861
No.

265
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:47,096
Oh. You must know them.

266
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,749
So, um, how old are you?

267
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,167
Twenty-one.

268
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,502
How old are you?

269
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,253
Mm, older than you.

270
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,048
(in Russian): How old are you? 25?

271
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,884
(in English): No, I'm-I'm 23.

272
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,636
Oh, wow.

273
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,056
(in Russian): You act like
you are 25.

274
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:17,118
(in English): Okay.

275
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:19,796
You're funny.

276
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:20,989
Yeah, I know.

277
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,516
So, funny? Why?

278
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,277
I don't know.

279
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,862
You're just... you're, like...

280
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,155
You're funny. It's...

281
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,782
Funny cool, right?

282
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,117
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah.

283
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,868
Really funny cool.

284
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,792
And if you don't
mind me asking,

285
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:44,053
like, what do you do
to get all of this?

286
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,756
What do you think I do?

287
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,426
Well, what do you think
I think you do?

288
00:16:49,751 --> 00:16:52,279
Oh, fucking English.

289
00:16:53,504 --> 00:16:55,548
Mm. Okay. I can say,

290
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:59,869
but it's, uh...
it's really big secret.

291
00:17:00,094 --> 00:17:01,246
Okay.

292
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,733
I'm really big drug dealer.

293
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,361
Oh, really?

294
00:17:08,886 --> 00:17:10,713
Why you trust...?

295
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,073
No.

296
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,950
But I'm really big gun dealer.

297
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:16,177
Mm. Okay.

298
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,345
Come on.

299
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,222
Oh, my God.

300
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,005
Wait, so, like, you made
some app or something?

301
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,716
- Is that...
- Yeah. Yeah. I-I made.

302
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:32,302
(in Russian): I do have
some cool ideas for apps...

303
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,221
(in English): No, but no, no.
I... No.

304
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,558
Okay.

305
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:41,260
My father... (speaks Russian)

306
00:17:41,586 --> 00:17:42,545
Yeah?

307
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,272
(in Russian): Long story short...

308
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,816
my dad is Nikolai Zakharov.

309
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,862
(in English): Whoa.

310
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:53,582
Sorry, I don't know who that is.

311
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:55,508
Google him.

312
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,494
- Google?
- Yeah.

313
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:06,185
Um... wait,
what's his name again?

314
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,504
Nikolai Zakharov.

315
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,255
I-I can spell it for you.

316
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,091
N-I-K-O-lai...

317
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,343
No, I-I got it.

318
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,261
- Yeah?
- Thank you.

319
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:17,931
Yeah, let me see.

320
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,516
"Children."

321
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,810
Yeah. Vanya Zakharov.

322
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,445
It's me.

323
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:27,290
Oh, shit.

324
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,067
"Oh, shit."

325
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:30,627
No. No way.

326
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,237
- Yes fucking way.
- Bro.

327
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,113
And I'm seeing him again
tonight, so...

328
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,573
Crazy.

329
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,243
I guess he had fun
or something.

330
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,286
Yeah, we all know
what fun you are, babe.

331
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,958
Uh, you want to mind
your fucking business?

332
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:47,276
You're making it
our fucking business.

333
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:49,387
- Calm down, Diamond.
- Chatty bitch.

334
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:50,923
Gross.

335
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:54,500
Ginger cunt.

336
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,902
Yeah.

337
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:26,165
Oh!

338
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,085
Oh.

339
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:59,107
(in Russian): This is genius.

340
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,325
(in English): Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

341
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,523
Oh, that was crazy.

342
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,443
(in Russian): Little bonus
because you're the best.

343
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,573
(in English): Okay.

344
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,116
(in Russian): Let's go!

345
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:45,787
By the way,

346
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,206
I'm having a party.

347
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,458
(in English): New Year's party.

348
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,168
(in Russian): And you have to
come.

349
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,878
(in English): It's going to be
banging.

350
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,425
I might have to work
that night.

351
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,345
Oh, no.
You might not work that night.

352
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,564
(in Russian): Fuck.

353
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,426
(in English): Can I bring
someone?

354
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:09,552
No.

355
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:11,287
Uh, if it is a boy, no.

356
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,356
I don't want a sausage party.

357
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,816
(in Russian): Fuck.

358
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,818

Okay. See you here.

360
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,615

shoot?

361
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,994
(in English): What?

362
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,458
You know, you paid for an hour,

363
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,669
and there's still
like 45 minutes left,

364
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,046
if you want to go again.

365
00:21:48,116 --> 00:21:49,859
No fucking way.

366
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,435

371
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,168

00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,918

00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,586
Okay. One minute.

00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,214
One minute, one question.

Would you want to be

461
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:16,794
Fifteen.

00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:18,195

00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:26,295
Deal.

465
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:31,484
You know,
I would've done it for ten.

466
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,152
(in Russian): Well, if I were you,

467
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:36,113
I wouldn't do it for less
than thirty.

468
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,508
Goodbye.

469
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:03,640

00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,980
She's fucking hot, man.

00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,100
Yeah, baby.

Go ahead. Tell him. Tell him.

478
00:28:25,888 --> 00:28:28,356
- Okay. Thank you.
- Tell him, because I don't want to.

479
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:30,050
- I am gonna fucking tell him.
- What's going on?

480
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,660
- You don't even want to know.
- Hi, Jimmy.

481
00:28:31,685 --> 00:28:33,061
You don't want to fucking know,
Jimmy.

482
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,013
She wants a week off.

483
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:37,416
- I thought you wanted me to tell him.
- You see the shit that I have to deal with?

484
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:40,169
I just made the schedule.
Now she wants to pull this bullshit.

485
00:28:40,194 --> 00:28:41,279
Oh. The schedule.

486
00:28:41,504 --> 00:28:44,181
- We just gave you New Year's.
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Jimmy,

487
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,024
once you give me
health insurance,

488
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,636
workers' comp
and a fucking 401K,

489
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:50,788
then you can tell me
when I work and not work.

490
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:53,782
Well, none of that's
gonna happen, so...

491
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:55,643
- Shocker.
- Bye.

492
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:03,384
I'll be back on Tuesday.

493
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:04,452
Today is Tuesday.

494
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,370
Correct.

495
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,706
- That's a week.
- No shit.

496
00:29:15,244 --> 00:29:16,580
Thank you.

497
00:29:29,218 --> 00:29:30,803
- You like that?
- No.

498
00:29:33,013 --> 00:29:35,099
(chatter in Russian)

499
00:29:36,934 --> 00:29:40,604
You know, Ani, it's the
champagne glass of my mother.

500
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:42,214
Of my fucking mother.

501
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,742
And it will be
your champagne glass.

502
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:47,136
And what we are cheering for?

503
00:29:47,361 --> 00:29:49,555
About my new girlfriend.

504
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,790
- Hell yeah. To Ani.
- Yeah.

505
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,834
(in Russian): To the most
amazing chick.

506
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,212
(in English): Yeah.

507
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:57,588
- One more. One more.
- Okay.

508
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:58,756
Instantly. Instantly.

509
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,662
(in Russian): Fuck.

510
00:30:24,231 --> 00:30:26,316
Klara, maybe you want a hit?

511
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,677
Sorry, Ivan. Not today.

512
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:29,963
Mm-hmm.

513
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,581
(in English): It was really
funny when, uh,

514
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,291
Klara smoked
last time.

515
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,585
My mother, uh, caught her
in the cryo chamber.

516
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,212
(in Russian): What?

517
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,047
Nothing, just keep working.

518
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:43,158
(in English): You have a cryo
chamber?

519
00:30:43,183 --> 00:30:43,976
Yeah.

520
00:30:47,588 --> 00:30:49,131
Oh, shit.

521
00:30:49,156 --> 00:30:50,866
Yeah, but I'm not allowed
to drive them

522
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,810
because my parents are dicks.

523
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:56,897
- What's up?
- How are you?

524
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,274
- I'm good.
- Yeah, what's up, man?

525
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,441
- What's up, Ivan?
- Welcome.

526
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:01,469
You guys can just, like,
eat whatever the fuck you want.

527
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:02,511
We got ice cream.

528
00:31:02,636 --> 00:31:04,013
There's, like,
whatever the fuck these are.

529
00:31:04,138 --> 00:31:04,972
There's Ring Pops.

530
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:06,807
Like, literally,
I just fuck around in here.

531
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,435
The boss is old as fuck,
and he's, like, blind and deaf.

532
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,661
He can't even fucking hear us right now,
Helen Keller-ass bitch, like...

533
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:13,188

Are you happy?

559
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,770
Yes. Very happy.

560
00:32:26,795 --> 00:32:28,672
Are you happy?

561
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,450
Yeah, I'm always happy.

562
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:35,062
No, it's really good lines,
but ladies first.

563
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,321
Ladies first.

564
00:32:36,346 --> 00:32:38,599
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's...
Can you...

565
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,337
(in Russian): Guys,

566
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:47,758
the best ketamine I ever tried

567
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,518
was in Vegas!

568
00:32:49,777 --> 00:32:52,237
(in English): Vegas.
It's a great idea.

569
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,556
We are going to fucking Vegas.

570
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,191
Welcome to Vegas!

571
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,187
We're in Vegas, bitch!

572
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:11,590
- Ah.
- Welcome back, Mr. Zakharov.

573
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,575
Your suite is almost ready.

574
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:15,293
We didn't know you were coming,

575
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,820
- and the suite was occupied...
- Uh-huh.

576
00:33:16,845 --> 00:33:18,138
...but they're out,

577
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,207
and housekeeping
should be done any minute.

578
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,419
What the fuck, man?
Are you fucking kidding me?

579
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:25,003
You mean I have to wait?

580
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:26,964
You mean we have to wait
right now, bro, yes?

581
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:27,965
Yes?

582
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,591
Tell him,
tell him, tell him, Ivan.

583
00:33:29,617 --> 00:33:30,968
- Yeah, go off, Vanya.
- Come on. Come on.

584
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:33,178
I am fucking with you, dude.

585
00:33:33,403 --> 00:33:34,671
We will stay here.

586
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:36,356
- It's nice to come back.
- Very good.

587
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,834
Let's go apeshit
on this fucking casino.

588
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,728
Have a great time.

589
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,414
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

590
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,443
Yeah! Oh!

591
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,188
Can somebody turn on music?

592
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:52,814
- Can... Tom, Tom.
- Turn on the music!

593
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,091
I got it. I got it.

594
00:34:02,858 --> 00:34:04,509
Try this, try this, try this.

595
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:06,161
Vanya! I want this one!

596
00:34:06,286 --> 00:34:08,246
- No, no, no. No. No, no, no.
- This one's mine!

597
00:34:08,272 --> 00:34:09,898
- Vanya!
- Go away from my room!

598
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,992
You claim this room,
I claim your sister.

599
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:13,351
I claim your mom.

600
00:34:13,377 --> 00:34:15,087
If you are ready now,
yeah, we can...

601
00:34:15,112 --> 00:34:16,938
- You ready now?
- Okay, yes, I'm ready now.

602
00:34:16,964 --> 00:34:17,990
You want me to...

603
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,897
Let's play blackjack, for sure.

604
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,498
"We are going in, all in."

605
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:27,700
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah, say it.

606
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:29,768
- We are going all in.
- Motherfucker.

607
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:33,029
Twenty-two, all in.

608
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:36,792
Whatever. Whatever, guys.

609
00:34:36,817 --> 00:34:38,651
- How much money is that?
- What...

610
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,052
But do it with a double dose

611
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,763
because we're gonna go
even harder tonight.

612
00:34:58,188 --> 00:34:59,731
Okay?

613
00:35:00,749 --> 00:35:01,833
(speaks Russian)

614
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:05,729
(in Russian): Thank you.

615
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,356
(in English): Tom, give me a cigarette.

616
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,858
- Oh.
- One cigarette.

617
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,989
- You know? Fuck you.
- (speaks Russian)

618
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,745
They fucking do this every day.

619
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,598
I am really happy
that we are here,

620
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,383
- and, uh... I don't know.
- Thank you.

621
00:35:26,408 --> 00:35:27,951
Fuck. You're the best, guys.

622
00:35:27,976 --> 00:35:29,694
You are the fucking best.

623
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,495
Vanya. Vanya.

624
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,922
Vanya.

625
00:35:40,947 --> 00:35:43,324
- Vanya, wait, wait, wait.
- What happened?

626
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,226
Well, you know,
it could last longer

627
00:35:45,252 --> 00:35:48,505
and be better
if you just take it easy.

628
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,739
Like, how?

629
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:51,892
Here. Let me do it.

630
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,695
Ah.

631
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,575
Mm-hmm.

632
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,201
Oh, I think I love you.

633
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,161
Fuck.

634
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,545
I hope you had fun this week.

635
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,480
I hope you had fun
this week.

636
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,415
Oh, I did.

637
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:18,576
You know, we should
do it again sometime.

638
00:36:18,602 --> 00:36:19,861
Yeah.

639
00:36:20,087 --> 00:36:21,514
For sure.

640
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,433
Mm, but...

641
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:28,770
I have to go back to Russia
because I promised my father

642
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:31,973
that I would start working
in his fucking company.

643
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,375
Oh.

644
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:37,112
Okay, so that's why
you've been splashing out, hmm?

645
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,789
Eh, no, I am always
partying like this.

646
00:36:40,215 --> 00:36:40,899
Mm.

647
00:36:40,924 --> 00:36:42,551
I love it.

648
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,292
Well, I'm gonna miss you.

649
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:54,779
- What?
- What?

650
00:36:54,904 --> 00:36:57,157
Does that, like, sound weird?

651
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:58,475
No, no.

652
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,002
And will you miss me
or my money blyat?

653
00:37:01,128 --> 00:37:03,196
Or your money blyat.

654
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,058
- Of course.
- Yeah, I like it.

655
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:09,953
But, mm, if I get married
to an American,

656
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,522
I wouldn't have to go back
to Russia.

657
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,776
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

658
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,361
Okay.

659
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:18,987
So, who would you marry?

660
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,997
I don't know.

661
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:22,975
Maybe Crystal.

662
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,160
Or your friend Lulu.

663
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,329
She's so hot.

664
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:30,958
You.

665
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:32,734
"You."

666
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,462
It's Vegas.

667
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,013
It's fucking Vegas.

668
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:38,456
Don't people get married
in Vegas?

669
00:37:38,482 --> 00:37:40,692
Mm... Don't fuck around.

670
00:37:40,817 --> 00:37:43,987
I am not fucking around.

671
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:46,840
Okay.

672
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,518
Okay, go.

673
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:51,478
- Go get married.
- Yes.

674
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,513
Yes, let's get married.

675
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:54,915
Fuck. You asshole.

676
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,783
- Why?
- Don't.

677
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:59,603
Like, don't fucking tease me
with that shit, okay?

678
00:37:59,628 --> 00:38:01,313
- Stop.
- It ain't cool.

679
00:38:01,438 --> 00:38:03,315
Stop, stop, stop.

680
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,759
- Ani.
- Yeah?

681
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,045
Will you marry me?

682
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:13,183
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

683
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,127
Mm-hmm.

684
00:38:15,352 --> 00:38:18,105
So you want to get married
to me, Vanya?

685
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,357
You want me to be
your little wifey?

686
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,100
Yeah?

687
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,610
Yes.

688
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:27,422
I just think that we had
great time together, and, uh...

689
00:38:27,447 --> 00:38:30,283
(in Russian): Shit, I'm nervous.
I'll say it in Russian.

690
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,103
I think
we would have a great time

691
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,480
even if I didn't have money.

692
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,141
(in English): And I will become
American,

693
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:40,919
and my parents
will suck my dick.

694
00:38:46,274 --> 00:38:48,276
Are you serious?

695
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,247
I am serious.

696
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,541
And I said it twicely.

697
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:08,897
Three carats.

698
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:12,942
What about four or five?

699
00:39:13,468 --> 00:39:14,844
Or six?

700
00:39:22,435 --> 00:39:24,229
Do you promise to love, honor

701
00:39:24,254 --> 00:39:26,047
and cherish her
all the days of your life?

702
00:39:26,173 --> 00:39:27,465
I do.

703
00:39:27,591 --> 00:39:29,009
And do you, Anora, take this

704
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,911
handsome gentleman
standing before you

705
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:34,289
to be your best friend,
your protector, your husband?

706
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,458
Do you promise to love,
honor and cherish him

707
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,085
all the days of your life?

708
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,921
- Say yes.
- Oh, fuck yeah, I do.

709
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:43,398
It is now my great honor

710
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,383
to now pronounce you
as husband and wife.

711
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:48,068
You may seal your promises
with a kiss!

712
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,262
My wife!

713
00:40:06,287 --> 00:40:08,498
- It's my wife, man.
- We got married!

714
00:40:12,685 --> 00:40:14,312
It's my wife. She can do it.

715
00:40:14,337 --> 00:40:15,839
It's my wife, man.

716
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:19,876
Yeah, we got married
five minutes ago, man.

717
00:40:19,901 --> 00:40:21,545
You're an American, Vanya.

718
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,547
- I'm fucking American!
- We're fucking married!

719
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:26,007
I am American, bitch!

720
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:30,971
So, this is for real?

721
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:32,489
Yeah, it's for real.

722
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:34,307
- What do you mean?
- 'Cause if it is,

723
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,226
I got to stop letting
the high rollers in.

724
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,936
They're stealing my best girls.

725
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,922
Come here.

726
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:41,898
You're so lucky.

727
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,317
Oh, my God, I know. Thank you.

728
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,961
Yay!

729
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,197
You hit the lotto, bitch.

730
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,824
Aw. Oh, my God.

731
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,709
Are you gonna cry?

732
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,586
Stop. You don't...

733
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,663
You'll come over
for dinner, right?

734
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,790
You know, I've been thinking
about our honeymoon,

735
00:40:59,015 --> 00:41:00,934
and I think we should do it
at Disney World

736
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,419
because that's been,
like, my dream

737
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,254
- since I've been a little girl.
- Stop.

738
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,214
Yeah. You know those suites

739
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,508
where it's, like,
the Disney Princess theme?

740
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,927
- Cinderella.
- Yes, fucking Cinderella.

741
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,971
You know me
so fucking well, babe.

742
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,640
Bye, Ani.
You better visit us, bitch.

743
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:18,059
Oh, of course I will, Jenny.

744
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:20,770
- Bye, babe.
- Caught your whale?

745
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,606
Seems I did, didn't I?

746
00:41:23,831 --> 00:41:26,058
I give it two weeks, bitch.

747
00:41:29,979 --> 00:41:33,633
Oh, Diamond. Oh, sweetie.

748
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,503
You know, I really hope you
find your happiness one day.

749
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:39,280
- I really hope...
- I hope you find a fucking plastic surgeon.

750
00:41:39,306 --> 00:41:41,307
- What the fuck?!
- Okay, Ani. Ani, come on.

751
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,685
Play in my fucking face again, bitch.
See what happens.

752
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,520
- You're a fucking bitch.
- Oh, stay jealous, babe.

753
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:46,630
Stay jealous, honey.

754
00:41:46,855 --> 00:41:48,148
Jealousy is a disease.

755
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:50,175
Remember that, Diamond.

756
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,469
I'm just gonna go chill
in my mansion or whatever.

757
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:54,262
You know, no big deal.

758
00:41:55,087 --> 00:41:56,331
Hey.

759
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:48,942
(in Russian): This is
impossible!

760
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,278
These are just
rumors.

761
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,907
I was with him two weeks ago.

762
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,492
He isn't married.

763
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:04,082
With all due respect,
Galina Stepanovna.

764
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,002
These are just rumors.

765
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:10,880
No... but I'm heading there now.

766
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,722
Garnik. Garnik.

767
00:43:21,791 --> 00:43:22,875
(in English):
Now?

768
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,277
- Yes.
- Now?

769
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:39,117
(in Russian): Take this. Grab
the Russian and get over there.

770
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:41,870
What did he do now?

771
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,763
(in English): Die, die, die.

772
00:43:51,988 --> 00:43:53,531
Yeah.

773
00:43:56,359 --> 00:43:57,618
Come on.

774
00:43:57,652 --> 00:43:59,988
(in Russian): Just answer it or
shut it off.

775
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,931
(responds in Russian)

776
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,279
- Vanya.
- Hmm?

777
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,782
(in English): What did, uh...

778
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:21,451
what did they say when you told
them?

779
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:25,872
I don't want really
talk about them.

780
00:44:28,817 --> 00:44:31,236
Well, you did tell them, right?

781
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:34,005
Mm. Sure.

782
00:44:38,059 --> 00:44:39,736
I mean...

783
00:44:39,961 --> 00:44:42,589
(in Russian): This is good news, right?

784
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:47,769
Parents usually want
their kids to get married.

785
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,271
Yeah,

786
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:52,816
but my parents are dicks,
you know.

787
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:56,277
(in English): Uh, whatever. Mm.

788
00:44:58,238 --> 00:45:00,281
(in Russian): No matter what,

789
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:03,451
I hope they like me...

790
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:05,245
(in English): You know...

791
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,748
(in Russian): when we meet.

792
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:13,002
By the way,

793
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:16,423
when will we meet your parents?

794
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,591
Mm...

795
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:25,348
Well, if you want
to go to Miami...

796
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:29,644
My mom lives there with her man.

797
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:34,816
And you can meet
my sister anytime.

798
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:40,321
Although I'm sure
she'll try to steal you.

799
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:43,116
She loves Russian guys.

800
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:46,035
(repeats sentence in Russian)

801
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:49,247
(in English): What?
Are you making fun of me?

802
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,166
I'm trying here, asshole.

803
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:53,126
(in Russian): No, your Russian
is wonderful! Really.

804
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,952
Every single day
you're doing better and better.

805
00:45:54,978 --> 00:45:57,338
You're almost like
a native speaker.

806
00:45:57,464 --> 00:45:59,466
(in English):
Oh, okay.

807
00:45:59,691 --> 00:46:00,917
- You're a liar.
- No, no, no.

808
00:46:00,942 --> 00:46:02,235
Not now. Ani, not now.

809
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,888
(in Russian): I'm playing.
I have a mission.

810
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:07,307
Give me the controller.

811
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:08,808
I lost!

812
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,980
- Okay.
- Okay.

813
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:16,774
(in Russian): "Arguments and
Facts"

814
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,152
ran a photo of him with
some chick

815
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,279
at an NBA game.

816
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:25,366
And they are saying
she's a prostitute.

817
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,289
It's not funny, man.

818
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:32,957
Don't you dare laugh.

819
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:36,711
If it's true,
Toros and I are fucked.

820
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:41,633
Well, Toros would be fucked
more than me, but still.

821
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:43,927
Sounds like tabloid bullshit.

822
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:45,678
Probably.

823
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,848
But listen, if things get crazy,

824
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,850
don't get rough with Ivan.

825
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:54,062
Actually, don't even touch Ivan,
let me deal with him.

826
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:56,523
I got you. But what
do you need me for then?

827
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:59,067
In case his boys are there

828
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:01,486
and they want to play games.

829
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,240
(in English): Hey. Is Ivan at
the house?

830
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:06,616
I don't know.

831
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,034
He hasn't left
since I've been here,

832
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,453
but I just started my shift.

833
00:47:10,678 --> 00:47:13,139
Do you know if he got married?

834
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:14,891
Married?

835
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:17,168
I have no idea.
I just got here.

836
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,337
Okay, open the gate.

837
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,800
(in Russian): Drive in
and park on the right side.

838
00:47:28,263 --> 00:47:29,597
Right here.

839
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,831
- (in English): Expecting guests?
- No way.

840
00:48:04,498 --> 00:48:05,549
Oh.

841
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:07,260
(in Russian): Yo, what do you
want?

842
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,970
Ivan, it's Garnik.

843
00:48:09,395 --> 00:48:11,172
I know. What do you want?

844
00:48:11,197 --> 00:48:13,408
Ivan, open the door, please.

845
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:16,911
- I'm busy. No.
- We have to talk.

846
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,896
Why do I always have
to repeat myself with you?

847
00:48:19,022 --> 00:48:21,107
I'm busy, I have guests.

848
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,192
Ivan, it's important.
We have to talk.

849
00:48:23,217 --> 00:48:26,103
No, we're done.
Get the fuck out of here.

850
00:48:26,646 --> 00:48:27,755
(in English): Who was that?

851
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,073
They're my father's monkeys.

852
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:31,409
(in Russian): Son of a bitch.

853
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:34,996
(in English): What the fuck?

854
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:36,456
(in Russian): Are you fucking
kidding me?

855
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:37,874
What the fuck are
you doing?

856
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:39,667
You think you can enter
my house like this?

857
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:42,420
- (in English): Vanya, what the fuck?
- (in Russian): Slow down, you'll break my leg.

858
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:43,504
I don't give a fuck.

859
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,590
- (in English): Vanya, should I call 911?
- It's okay. It's okay.

860
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:47,925
(in Russian): Ivan, your father
sent us.

861
00:48:48,051 --> 00:48:49,802
Right, my father sent you.
Are you kidding me?

862
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:54,273
Well, not us. Your father sent
Toros and Toros sent us.

863
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:56,300
So, where's Toros?

864
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:57,852
He's busy.

865
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:01,064
But he will be very upset
with you if this is true.

866
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:02,231
If what is true?

867
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:03,358
That you got married

868
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:04,484
to some prostitute.

869
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,819
(in English): What?

870
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:08,988
(in Russian): Is that her?

871
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:11,240
- Are you married to her?
- Yes!

872
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:12,909
Did you lose your fucking mind?

873
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:15,286
Yes, we married
and we're doing fucking great!

874
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,663
With a signature and paperwork?

875
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:20,291
Yes. Now get the fuck out
of my house.

876
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:22,794
You're in big trouble, brother!

877
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:25,797
You'll be in trouble if
you don't move your fucking leg.

878
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:28,049
(in English): Vanya, what the
fuck is going on?

879
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,593
(in Russian): We'll wait, I need
to see the marriage license.

880
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,261
Fuck. Are you serious?

881
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:35,890
Bro, the faster we do it,
the faster we're out of here.

882
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,184
My parents are fucking crazy!

883
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,811
(in English): Okay.

884
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:41,979
(in Russian): If my parents need
proof, I'll give them proof.

885
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:43,773
(in English): Uh, where
is the marriage paper?

886
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,149
- Uh, marriage...
- The marriage license?

887
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:46,401
- License, yeah.
- It's, um...

888
00:49:46,526 --> 00:49:48,027
It's in the desk
in the office. Why?

889
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,570
- Okay. Uh...
- Should I go with you?

890
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:51,280
Uh, no, no, no. Stay here.

891
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:52,699
(in Russian): Wait here.

892
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:12,684
(in English): Hi.

893
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,817
(in Russian): Here.
Choke on it, dude.

894
00:50:43,065 --> 00:50:44,483
(in English): I'm Igor.

895
00:50:46,677 --> 00:50:47,719
You?

896
00:50:49,355 --> 00:50:51,399
Ani.

897
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:53,384
I'm Vanya's wife.

898
00:50:57,597 --> 00:50:59,390
Congratulations.

899
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:03,728
(in Russian): What are you
doing?

900
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:08,691
I've been asked to take a photo
of the license... if it exists.

901
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:09,942
That's insane.

902
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,694
My parents asked for that?

903
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:12,987
Toros.

904
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:14,947
Are you fucking kidding me?

905
00:51:37,545 --> 00:51:39,296
(in English): No.

906
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,769
What the fuck is going on here?

907
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,276
I have no idea.

908
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,241
(in Russian): It's over, go, go,
go, go...

909
00:51:58,366 --> 00:51:59,575
Wait.

910
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,035
Wait.

911
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,870
- (in English): Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's okay.

912
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:04,513
Yeah? What the fuck
is going on?

913
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,249
Yeah, just time
to say goodbye to guys.

914
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:08,793
(in Russian): Me and my wife
need some privacy.

915
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:11,003
You look tired, Garnik, go home.

916
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,422
We need to wait to see
what Toros says.

917
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:16,592
I'm waiting for you
and your fucking Armenian ass

918
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,010
to be out of my house.

919
00:52:28,362 --> 00:52:29,822
(in English):
Sorry.

920
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,442
So sorry.

921
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:35,653
I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

922
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:39,282
(in Russian): I'm waiting for
you to be on your fucking way.

923
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:40,449
Bye, bro!

924
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,368
Ivan...

925
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,245
It's Toros.

926
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,330
(in English): "Stand by."

927
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,332
(speaks Russian)
..."Stand by"?

928
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:51,043
He texted, "Stand by,"
so we stand by.

929
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,130
- So stand by outside my mansion, motherfuckers.
- Yeah.

930
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:55,298
(in Russian): What's the problem?

931
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,841
So apparently, it is true.

932
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:03,139
Yes.
I've seen the marriage license.

933
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,603
Galina Stepanovna,
please don't worry.

934
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:11,480
Ivan, with all due respect...

935
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:13,608
your father sent us.

936
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:15,651
Fucking Toros sent you!

937
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:18,988
Toros works for me! I pay him!

938
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:22,867
And you bring some fucking
gopnik into my home.

939
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:25,661
I promise,
I will fix everything.

940
00:53:29,749 --> 00:53:32,501
Galina Stepanovna.
Yes, Galina Stepanovna.

941
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:36,380
I'm having your ass fired!
You're dead for this!

942
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:37,882
Bitch!

943
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:40,927
(in English): Okay, look, look.
You work for Ivan's family,

944
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:43,846
so I'm assuming that means
you work for him, right?

945
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:46,140
So if he's telling you
to take it outside,

946
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,558
fucking take it outside.

947
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,393
Fucking take it outside!
Listen to my wife.

948
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:50,853
Real talk! (speaks Russian)

949
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,003
- Are you kidding me?
- Everybody, so sorry.

950
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,305
I have to go.

951
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:03,832
I have an emergency.
Sorry about that.

952
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,664
(in Russian): He says we have
to stay here.

953
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:11,248
Move, move...

954
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:12,792
Move. Thank you.

955
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,878
- Wait.
- It's Toros.

956
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:19,006
- (in English): Hello, Toros.
- Put me on the fucking speaker

957
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:20,633
so this hooker
can hear me, too.

958
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:23,177
He just called me a hooker?

959
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,054
(in Russian): You're already
on speaker.

960
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:28,057
(in English): She's fucking
erotic dancer. Hi, Toros.

961
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,017
What did you do, Ivan?

962
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:31,310
What did you do?

963
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:33,688
(in Russian): I don't check in on you

964
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:35,022
for two weeks

965
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,983
and you go
and marry a prostitute!

966
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,484
<i>Fucking hell!</i>

967
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,152
(in English): I'm not a fucking
prostitute,

968
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,195
you fucking piece of
shit.

969
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,488
Yeah, fucking Armenian
piece of shit.

970
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,699
You Armenian piece of shit!

971
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:46,117
<i>(in Russian): Do you understand</i>

972
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:47,618
how shameful this is?

973
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,664
- Toros.
<i>- Your mother was crying, do you hear me?</i>

974
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,199
Toros!

975
00:54:53,224 --> 00:54:55,318
(in English): Your mother,
she never cry in her life.

976
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:56,711
She was crying on the phone.

977
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:58,212
- Toros!
- Shame on you!

978
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:00,047
- Fuck you! Blyat!
- Ivan.

979
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:01,674
(in Russian): Fucking faggot.

980
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,175
And guess what?

981
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,094
Guess what, you little shit!

982
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,762
And what? Surprise me!

983
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:09,181
<i>You really did it this time.</i>

984
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,182
What?

985
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,393
Your parents are on their way!

986
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:13,644
Your parents are on the way.

987
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:15,229
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

988
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:16,230
To where?

989
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:18,816
<i>Here. Where else? Here!</i>

990
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:22,862
<i>Coming to pick you up
like a naughty school boy,</i>

991
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,363
<i>you hear me?</i>

992
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:26,407
<i>We're meeting them
tomorrow at noon.</i>

993
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,409
(in English): Vanya,
what the fuck is going on?

994
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,619
<i>(in Russian): They're taking
you back to Russia,</i>

995
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:32,288
<i>so start packing.</i>

996
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:34,457
(in English): Ivan, what
the fuck? What does that mean?

997
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:36,292
Do you understand?

998
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,003
Game over for you. That's it.

999
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:40,838
Vanya, we are married.

1000
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,423
They're gonna
have to accept that.

1001
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,091
- Yeah, I know!
- Yes.

1002
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:46,302
Accept that?

1003
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:48,679
That's funny. Sure, yeah.

1004
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,515
(in Russian): Ivan, listen to me
carefully.

1005
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,560
I'll be there in ten minutes.

1006
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,938
<i>You and your whore
are coming with me.</i>

1007
00:55:58,064 --> 00:55:59,523
Whore?

1008
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,817
(in English): Your mother is a
fucking... (speaks Russian)

1009
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,320
- Who the fuck is this guy?
- Hey! I'm gonna be there

1010
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:05,905
in ten minutes, you hear me?

1011
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,365
In ten minutes, both of you
are coming with me

1012
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:09,992
down to the city hall.

1013
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,660
We're gonna annul
this marriage.

1014
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:14,288
Do you hear me? This marriage
is gonna be annulled!

1015
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:17,583
Oh, I am not going
fucking anywhere.

1016
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,461
We are not getting a divorce
because you tell us to!

1017
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:22,004
Go fuck yourself!

1018
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,173
You go fuck yourself.
How about that?

1019
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,050
Me go fuck myself?
Me fuck myself?

1020
00:56:26,175 --> 00:56:28,636
You go fuck yourself and your
fucking mother, motherfucker!

1021
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:30,429
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

1022
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,223
You don't even know
who the fuck I am.

1023
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:34,642
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Toros, Toros, uh...

1024
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:35,851
(in Russian): You said my
parents

1025
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:38,229
are on their way to
America?

1026
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:40,773
(in English): Yes, yes. Are you deaf?

1027
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,900
They are leaving Russia
in an hour.

1028
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:45,069
Tomorrow noon, we're gonna
go meet them, you hear me?

1029
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:46,737
- What the fuck is going on?
- Come on.

1030
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:48,405
- Come on?
- Come on, come on, come on.

1031
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:50,074
Why do we have to leave
the house?

1032
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:51,951
They can't just fucking
come in here like that.

1033
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:55,371
- Excuse me. Get the fuck away from me, please.
- (in Russian): Toros will be here in ten minutes.

1034
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:57,998
(in English): Garnik,
shut that bitch up, please.

1035
00:56:58,024 --> 00:56:59,483
- Where are we going, Ivan?
- Ivan, Ivan...

1036
00:56:59,508 --> 00:57:01,552
I don't know where
are we going, but we are going.

1037
00:57:01,977 --> 00:57:03,229
Where is he going?

1038
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:05,297
Why do we have to leave,
and why are they staying?

1039
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,049
- Ivan...
- That doesn't make any sense.

1040
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,593
- Ivan, where are you going?
- We should call the fucking police or something.

1041
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:11,345
(in Russian): In ten minutes,
Toros will be here...

1042
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,388
- Vanya.
- Garnik!

1043
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:13,722
Did he say he's leaving?

1044
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:15,516
- Ivan! We...
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1045
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:17,268
Okay! I need to get dressed, though!

1046
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:21,063
- (in English): My fucking clothes are upstairs. Fuck!
- (in Russian): No, no. Let's do this, let's wait for Toros.

1047
00:57:21,088 --> 00:57:23,090
Garnik, get him.
Garnik, don't let him leave.

1048
00:57:23,115 --> 00:57:26,551
- (in Russian): Toros will arrive in ten minutes.
- Vanya, wait. Give me one fucking minute.

1049
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:28,337
Stop, stop. Where are you going?
No. We have no time.

1050
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:30,915
- I have to get dressed, Ivan. I have no fucking pants on.
- Oh, God!

1051
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,283
Okay, bye.

1052
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:33,976
- (speaks Russian)
- Did he say bye?

1053
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:35,870
- What the fuck? Are you fucking kidding me?
- (in Russian): Keep her here.

1054
00:57:35,895 --> 00:57:37,438
- Did he say bye?
 - Ivan!

1055
00:57:37,464 --> 00:57:39,048
(in English): Oh, my fucking God!
Garnik!

1056
00:57:39,173 --> 00:57:40,591
Ivan, what the fuck?!

1057
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,585
Whoa. Uh...

1058
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:44,653
Get the fuck out of my way.

1059
00:57:45,588 --> 00:57:47,798
Ivan!

1060
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:50,050
Get the fuck out of
my fucking way, motherfucker.

1061
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:52,469
- But you...
- Do not fucking touch me!

1062
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:53,712
No. No, no, no.

1063
00:57:53,737 --> 00:57:54,780
(in Russian): Stop!

1064
00:57:56,797 --> 00:57:58,092
Ivan! Ivan!

1065
00:57:58,117 --> 00:57:59,535
(in English): ...fucking
touch me!

1066
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,804
- Relax. Relax. It's okay.
- You fucking relax.

1067
00:58:02,029 --> 00:58:04,740
What is happening?
Somebody talk to me, please!

1068
00:58:04,765 --> 00:58:05,849
Don't you touch me,
motherfucker!

1069
00:58:05,874 --> 00:58:07,877
- No, just...
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

1070
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:09,428
- Relax. Whoa.
- Motherfucker!

1071
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:11,138
Everything all right?

1072
00:58:11,263 --> 00:58:12,306
What?

1073
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:13,991
(in Russian): Fucking
impressive.

1074
00:58:15,201 --> 00:58:16,493
- (in English): Okay...
- Stay the fuck back!

1075
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:18,454
No, no. What?
No, no, no, no, no!

1076
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,247
Put it. It's-it's bad way.

1077
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:22,132
- Wha... Just sit.
- I fucking dare you.

1078
00:58:22,157 --> 00:58:23,575
Take another fucking step,
motherfucker.

1079
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,394
No. Just... I don't...
I don't touch you.

1080
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:27,171
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Don't leave.

1081
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:28,422
It's okay.

1082
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:30,132
Uh, just put it... Whoa!

1083
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:32,092
Stop.

1084
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,712
Please stop.

1085
00:58:36,238 --> 00:58:38,115
Stop, please.

1086
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,975
No, no. Stop.

1087
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:45,606
Stop. Stop, please.

1088
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,274
Garnik, what are you doing?

1089
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,518
Are you killing her?

1090
00:58:49,743 --> 00:58:51,011
- Stop it!
- Fuck!

1091
00:58:51,036 --> 00:58:53,004
Ivan throwing another one
of his tantrums, huh?

1092
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:56,408
Hold on. It's okay.

1093
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:00,287
If you don't stop...

1094
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:02,047
I will tie you up!

1095
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:04,708
You're not tying me up,
motherfucker!

1096
00:59:11,457 --> 00:59:14,051
Get the fuck off me!

1097
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:20,116
You are fucking insane.

1098
00:59:22,417 --> 00:59:24,519
Hey. Hey!

1099
00:59:24,544 --> 00:59:26,588
Help me! He's attacking me.

1100
00:59:26,613 --> 00:59:28,407
What the fuck
are you doing to her, bro?

1101
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:30,684
Get the fuck off me!
Somebody help!

1102
00:59:30,709 --> 00:59:32,670
-  Get him off me!
- (in Russian): What do you mean?

1103
00:59:32,695 --> 00:59:34,613
You wanted me to keep her here,
so I'm keeping her here.

1104
00:59:34,638 --> 00:59:36,082
Yes, but why
are you tying her up?

1105
00:59:36,207 --> 00:59:38,084
But she got fucking crazy,

1106
00:59:38,209 --> 00:59:39,502
started jumping all around.

1107
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:42,079
- (in English): Help me!
- (in Russian): What else could I do?

1108
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,956
(in English): Why are you just
fucking standing there?

1109
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,041
(in Russian): Igor, what the
fuck are you doing, man?

1110
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:49,003
She threw the candlestick at me.

1111
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:50,504
Let's tie her legs.

1112
00:59:51,029 --> 00:59:54,024
(in English): No, no, no, no!
Please, please, please, please don't.

1113
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:56,135
(in Russian): We are not doing
that, let her go!

1114
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,672
(in English): Let me go, you fucking asshole.
Goddamn fucking bastard.

1115
00:59:59,697 --> 01:00:01,991
(in Russian): She will run, bro.
I promise.

1116
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:03,785
Where will she run?

1117
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:06,095
We're two grown men here.
Are you out of your mind?

1118
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:13,994
(in English): Okay.

1119
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:23,162
You crazy motherfucker!

1120
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:24,997
You better stay the fuck
away from me!

1121
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,333
Stop, stop. Listen.
You are not going anywhere.

1122
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:29,126
Come back. Please come...

1123
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:30,669
(in Russian): She will run away!

1124
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:31,628
Really?

1125
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:33,005
(in English): Hey, stop.

1126
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,548
(in Russian): Get her!

1127
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:39,470
(in English): Get the fuck off me!

1128
01:00:42,798 --> 01:00:45,425
Put me down, motherfucker!

1129
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:48,670
(in Russian): Fuck!

1130
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,266
What the fuck, man?

1131
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:58,030
She's biting, fuck.

1132
01:00:58,855 --> 01:00:59,765
(in English): Fucker!

1133
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,830
(in Russian): C'mon, tie her legs.

1134
01:01:02,154 --> 01:01:03,075
How?

1135
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,996
- (in English): You motherfucker! Fuck!
- (in Russian): What do you mean how?

1136
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:08,632
(in English): Fucking motherfucker.
You fucking asshole.

1137
01:01:08,857 --> 01:01:11,708
- (in Russian): With fucking what?
- Use that cord!

1138
01:01:11,733 --> 01:01:13,552
(in English): No, no. Don't, don't.

1139
01:01:14,288 --> 01:01:16,081
I don't even know
what is going on here.

1140
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:19,025
I didn't do anything. Don't tie me.
I'm not gonna run. I promise.

1141
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,720
I'm calm. I'm not gonna do anything.
I'm not gonna run away.

1142
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:24,824
- You do not need to tie me.
- (in Russian): Are you fucking kidding, tie her!

1143
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:26,643
(in English): No, you-you motherfucker.
You don't need to tie me.

1144
01:01:26,668 --> 01:01:28,229
- Calm down. Listen, listen.
- I am calm. I am calm.

1145
01:01:28,254 --> 01:01:32,798
Ivan's father wants this marriage annulled.
You're staying here and getting this annulled.

1146
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:33,866
You heard my boss.

1147
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:37,853
Fuck your boss.

1148
01:01:37,878 --> 01:01:40,130
(in Russian): I swear
to fucking God!

1149
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:43,150
Garnik, you stupid fucking idiot!

1150
01:01:43,859 --> 01:01:45,277
Oh fuck.

1151
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,789
(in English): I just want to
know what is going on.

1152
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:51,291
Someone fucking tell me
what's going on.

1153
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:53,252
I'm not gonna run. Let me go.

1154
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:55,045
(in Russian): Damn, it's broken.

1155
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:57,589
I think she broke my nose.

1156
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,334
(in English): Yeah. I'm glad I
broke your fucking nose!

1157
01:02:00,459 --> 01:02:02,811
You fucking bitch,
you broke my nose!

1158
01:02:02,836 --> 01:02:04,871
Yeah? Next time, I'll kick you
in the fucking balls!

1159
01:02:04,896 --> 01:02:06,365
- God, let me go!
- (in Russian): Hold her.

1160
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,392
(in English): Garnik,
you fucking idiot, talk to me!

1161
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:11,010
- Fucking untie me, motherfucker!
- Hello? Garnik?

1162
01:02:11,036 --> 01:02:12,262
(in Russian): Hold on a minute, Toros.

1163
01:02:12,287 --> 01:02:13,756
(in English): You fucking
piece of shit.

1164
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:16,992
<i>- (in Russian): Hold on?</i>
- (in English): Fucking psycho.

1165
01:02:17,017 --> 01:02:18,710
(in Russian): C'mon man,
hold on! Fuck.

1166
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,163
(in English): I am not fighting.
<i>(in Russian): Garnik, I swear...</i>

1167
01:02:21,188 --> 01:02:23,273
<i>If you fucked this up...
Garnik, motherfucker.</i>

1168
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:28,702
(in English): Untie me. I am not fighting.
I'm not gonna run. Just fucking untie me.

1169
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,549
No.

1170
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:34,084
Don't let her go.

1171
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:35,419
<i>(in Russian): I swear...</i>

1172
01:02:35,544 --> 01:02:38,088
(in English): Oh, you are
so fucked.

1173
01:02:38,413 --> 01:02:39,956
You're going to prison.

1174
01:02:40,082 --> 01:02:41,583
Where's your ice?

1175
01:02:41,608 --> 01:02:43,777
I can't wait until Ivan sees
what you did to me.

1176
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,371
Rich people don't have ice?

1177
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:50,517
Ivan did just leave the house.

1178
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:52,019
He did not leave.

1179
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:54,271
He is going to get help.

1180
01:02:55,747 --> 01:02:57,624
I-I don't think so.

1181
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,077
Garnik!

1182
01:03:01,103 --> 01:03:02,546
You fucking asshole.

1183
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:04,406
Yeah, I bet you like this, huh?

1184
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,867
Yeah, you like this,
you sick fuck?

1185
01:03:07,192 --> 01:03:09,027
I bet you get off on this.

1186
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:10,846
Fucking psycho.

1187
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:13,248
Tor, where are you?

1188
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:15,042
<i>(in Russian): Here, you donkey
fucker.</i>

1189
01:03:15,567 --> 01:03:16,860
(in English): Open the gate.

1190
01:03:16,885 --> 01:03:18,136
Okay, sir, but Ivan just...

1191
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:19,371
Open the fucking gate!

1192
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:22,408
I am not fighting. Let me go.

1193
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,376
No.

1194
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:27,070
You are not going anywhere.

1195
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:29,056
(in Russian): Don't let her go
under any circumstances.

1196
01:03:29,381 --> 01:03:31,533
(in English): You two are
fucking dead for this!

1197
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,852
I am Ivan's fucking wife!

1198
01:03:38,932 --> 01:03:40,600
Vanya?

1199
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:50,786
Oh, are you the Armenian
fuck I was talking to?

1200
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,121
What the fuck is happening?

1201
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,998
Is this the big fucking boss?

1202
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:56,350
What happened here?

1203
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,318
- She happened.
- Hey, mister.

1204
01:03:58,343 --> 01:04:00,611
- Can you fucking tell this guy to untie me?
- What?

1205
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:01,680
Yeah, she did this.

1206
01:04:01,705 --> 01:04:03,131
- Hello.
- Where is Ivan?

1207
01:04:03,156 --> 01:04:04,466
Ivan run away.

1208
01:04:04,491 --> 01:04:06,218
- Why the fuck is no one an...
- Run away?

1209
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:08,303
- Excuse me, sir. Hello.
- You didn't stop him?

1210
01:04:08,328 --> 01:04:11,147
I-I tried, but then, uh, there was,
uh, ice on the floor.

1211
01:04:11,173 --> 01:04:12,641
- I tried to stop him.
- Hello!

1212
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:13,825
- You tried?
- Hello!

1213
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,194
- You tried? You don't try, you just grab the guy.
- Somebody fucking listen to me.

1214
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:17,680
What do you mean you tried?

1215
01:04:17,705 --> 01:04:19,865
- What do you mean? I'm not a...
- So he's gone?

1216
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,792
I'm not allowed to touch
that motherfucker.

1217
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:23,410
- Excuse me! Hello!
- Shut the fuck up!

1218
01:04:23,435 --> 01:04:26,488
No, you fucking let me go.
Tell this guy to fucking let me go.

1219
01:04:27,013 --> 01:04:28,882
(in Russian): What were you
doing? Why did you let him leave?

1220
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,750
(in English): Are you the boss?
You're the fucking boss?

1221
01:04:30,776 --> 01:04:32,736
(in Russian): What? He told me
not to touch the guy

1222
01:04:32,761 --> 01:04:35,164
and I was dealing with her.

1223
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:38,417
(in English): Fucking... Excuse me.
Oh, fucking motherfuckers.

1224
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:40,394
- Please leave your message...
- He doesn't answer.

1225
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:42,921
- (in Russian): He doesn't pick up.
- (in English): Hey, fuck face.

1226
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:44,756
(in Russian): Of course
he's not going to answer.

1227
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,050
(in English): Can you tell this
motherfucker to let me go?

1228
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:49,386
Why is she on top of you, man?
Wh-Wh-What's going on?

1229
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:52,347
I don't know what's going on.
Can you please tell him to untie me?

1230
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:55,058
- (in Russian): Why is she sitting on you?
- I'm holding her!

1231
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:56,560
(in English): Put-put her down, please.

1232
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:58,478
- No, don't do that.
- Yes, fucking put me down.

1233
01:04:58,604 --> 01:04:59,605
No, don't do that.

1234
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:01,440
Tell him to fucking
put me down, please.

1235
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:02,399
Put her down.

1236
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:03,984
- Why you holding her like that?
- Ow.

1237
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:05,977
- No, no, no. Be careful, bro.
- Fuck. Fuck!

1238
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:07,295
- Be careful.
- Why...

1239
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:09,364
Hey, now can you tell him
to fucking untie me?

1240
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,325
Why did you... Why...
Why did you tie her hands?

1241
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:12,492
- Untie me.
- Look.

1242
01:05:12,618 --> 01:05:15,462
- What, you afraid of this little girl?
- Can you tell him to fucking untie me?

1243
01:05:15,487 --> 01:05:17,565
- She's an animal.
- She's a fucking little girl! So, she...

1244
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:19,967
- She beat you both up?
- She's not fighting like one.

1245
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:22,336
- I'm gonna get my phone.
- Can you untie her?

1246
01:05:22,361 --> 01:05:25,322
- If you untie her, I'm just leaving, bro.
- This is ridiculous, man. Untie her.

1247
01:05:25,347 --> 01:05:27,224
- It's embarrassing.
- She will start swinging again. Don't do that.

1248
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:30,226
(in Russian): I can untie her but you won't get
what you need because she's out of control.

1249
01:05:30,752 --> 01:05:31,995
(in English): Fuck you.

1250
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:35,558
- She's an animal, bro. Trust me.
- No, these guys are fucking liars. - Okay, listen to me.

1251
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:37,643
Where is your phone? Can you
please give me your phone?

1252
01:05:38,068 --> 01:05:42,239
My phone is in the other room. I will go get my
phone if you untie me. I need you to untie me.

1253
01:05:42,364 --> 01:05:45,117
- Where? Which other room? Over there? Can-can
you... (in Russian): Go grab her phone, please.

1254
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,928
(in English): No, I will get my phone.
I'll get my phone, and I'll call Vanya.

1255
01:05:47,954 --> 01:05:49,330
I will untie you.
Give me a minute.

1256
01:05:49,554 --> 01:05:52,134
- No! No, don't do that!
- I just need your phone to call Ivan.

1257
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:55,195
- I know, and I will get my phone.
- (in Russian): I'm telling you to get the fucking phone!

1258
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,588
- (in English): Let's just calm down for one second.
- Careful.

1259
01:05:57,713 --> 01:05:59,067
Calm down for a second.

1260
01:05:59,091 --> 01:06:01,527
- Just calm down. And listen to me.
- I am calm. I'm not fucking moving.

1261
01:06:01,552 --> 01:06:04,620
Okay, look, we have an emergency here.
It's very important.

1262
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:07,923
Okay, I need you to cooperate.
I'm begging you.

1263
01:06:08,148 --> 01:06:09,649
Your guys came in here.

1264
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:11,510
They chased Ivan out
of the fucking house.

1265
01:06:11,735 --> 01:06:13,653
They fucking tied me.
They attacked me.

1266
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:16,306
That motherfucker was making me
sit on his fucking lap.

1267
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:17,933
Your guys are fucking crazy.

1268
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:21,186
I-I'm terribly sorry
it went down that way, okay?

1269
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,271
I'm terribly sorry.

1270
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:26,441
But now we have to just
call him, okay?

1271
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,527
Here. Help me, please.

1272
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,071
He's-he's on your phone?

1273
01:06:31,396 --> 01:06:32,772
Yeah, it's under "husband."

1274
01:06:32,898 --> 01:06:34,232
Okay. Yep.

1275
01:06:34,257 --> 01:06:35,759
"Husband."

1276
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:37,160
Here we go.

1277
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,516
<i>- Please leave your message...</i>
- It goes to voicemail.

1278
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,418
That's a fucking great
husband you have.

1279
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:47,421
First ditches you,
now doesn't answer your calls.

1280
01:06:47,546 --> 01:06:50,006
Real marriage my ass, man.

1281
01:06:50,132 --> 01:06:51,466
(in Russian): He's flown the coop.

1282
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:53,343
Fucking little piece of shit.

1283
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:55,303
(in English): I don't know what
kind of...

1284
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:57,264
fucked-up family shit
is going on here,

1285
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:59,599
but Ivan and I
are married, okay?

1286
01:06:59,725 --> 01:07:03,311
This is a real marriage,
and I'm not getting a divorce.

1287
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:09,225
This is not a real marriage.

1288
01:07:09,551 --> 01:07:10,602
This is a real marriage.

1289
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:12,045
Okay, and we're
getting it annulled,

1290
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:13,905
and you have no say in it.

1291
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:17,217
Well, I'm his fucking wife,
so I do think I have a say in it.

1292
01:07:17,243 --> 01:07:19,386
Absolutely not.
Listen to what I'm telling you.

1293
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:20,996
You got married illegally,

1294
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:22,914
it's a fraud marriage,
and we're

1295
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,125
- getting it annulled A.S.A.P.
- A fraud marriage?

1296
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:29,337
No, we are two consenting
adults who got married legally,

1297
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:31,498
and there is nothing
you can fucking do about it.

1298
01:07:31,523 --> 01:07:33,224
No, this is Ivan
just fooling around!

1299
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:35,001
- Would you get over it?
- No, it's not.

1300
01:07:35,126 --> 01:07:37,003
- You have no fucking idea.
- Oh, yeah?

1301
01:07:37,028 --> 01:07:38,446
When'd you guys meet, huh?

1302
01:07:38,472 --> 01:07:40,307
- When did you meet him?
- Strip club.

1303
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:43,101
I am telling you,
you do not know this guy.

1304
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:44,394
I do know him.

1305
01:07:44,419 --> 01:07:46,338
You do not know this guy,
I'm telling you.

1306
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:48,490
- Oh, I know my husband. I do.
- No, you don't.

1307
01:07:48,515 --> 01:07:51,001
It's classic Ivan. I've been dealing
with his shit since he was...

1308
01:07:51,226 --> 01:07:52,944
- ...he was six years old.
- Classic Ivan.

1309
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,696
And now his parents
are gonna kill me,

1310
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,699
and my fucking family
will never talk to me again.

1311
01:07:58,784 --> 01:08:00,619
(in Russian): Little bastard.

1312
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:02,904
And you left the baptism
half way because of this guy.

1313
01:08:02,929 --> 01:08:04,764
- Tell me about it.
- Oh my God.

1314
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:06,366
(in English): I love my husband,

1315
01:08:06,591 --> 01:08:09,435
and I plan on being with
him forever.

1316
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,704
No, don't give me
that bullshit.

1317
01:08:10,729 --> 01:08:12,981
Do not give me that bullshit.
You don't love him.

1318
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:15,634
You do not love him,
and he doesn't love you.

1319
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:18,011
You understand?
That's in your head.

1320
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:21,781
I can't wait to have
Ivan's children.

1321
01:08:21,807 --> 01:08:24,709
In fact, I think
I'm probably already pregnant.

1322
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:26,770
I-I certainly hope
you're lying,

1323
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:28,980
'cause we're gonna have to
take care of that, too.

1324
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,233
- I promise you that.
- Oh, the-the fuck you will.

1325
01:08:31,358 --> 01:08:33,235
- Yes, we will.
- And I would like all of you

1326
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,945
to fucking untie me
and leave my home,

1327
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:37,155
- or I will be pressing charges.
- Your home?!

1328
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,741
- Yeah, my home.
- This isn't Ivan's home.

1329
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,868
This is his father's house.

1330
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:44,287
Everything Ivan has
belongs to his father.

1331
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:46,706
You understand?
Ivan has nothing.

1332
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:49,084
You know that bedroom
you've been fucking in?

1333
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:50,585
That's his parents' room.

1334
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,420
Do you know
where is Ivan's room?

1335
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:55,757
It's down the hall with fucking
spaceships on the walls.

1336
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:57,509
Do you know why?

1337
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,637
- Do you know why?
- Fucking tell me why.

1338
01:08:59,662 --> 01:09:02,405
- You're already gonna tell me, so...
- Because he's a fucking child, that's why.

1339
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:04,182
Fucking kid.

1340
01:09:09,563 --> 01:09:11,606
You don't understand--
he's shamed his family

1341
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,984
by marrying somebody like you.

1342
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:16,278
If you think for a second
this is gonna be allowed,

1343
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:17,696
you're dead wrong.

1344
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,241
In fact, if-if you don't
help me fix this,

1345
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:22,951
I'm gonna have you arrested.

1346
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:24,411
Yeah.

1347
01:09:24,536 --> 01:09:26,121
- I'm gonna have you arrested.
- Arrested?

1348
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:27,414
Yeah.

1349
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:28,999
- That's fucking hilarious.
- Yep.

1350
01:09:29,124 --> 01:09:30,917
- Arrested for what?
- For what?

1351
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:32,460
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you for what.

1352
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:33,461
- Trespassing.
- "Trespassing."

1353
01:09:33,587 --> 01:09:36,047
Fraud, cheating.

1354
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,341
- Theft.
- Theft?

1355
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:40,343
- Yes, theft.
- Assault.

1356
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:44,014
And I... actually, the picture
is very, very clear here.

1357
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:48,393
A scheming prostitute
married Ivan, cheated...

1358
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,103
cheated Ivan to marry her

1359
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:53,023
so she can steal
from his wealthy family.

1360
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:55,442
- That's it.
- Mm-hmm. Definitely.

1361
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:57,569
And I'm sure you already
have criminal record, so...

1362
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,447
For sure happened.

1363
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:02,574
Yeah. One, two, three,
you're in jail.

1364
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,534
- Easy.
- Yep.

1365
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:06,369
Ivan proposed to me.

1366
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:08,204
He wanted to get married.

1367
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:09,956
He put a fucking ring
on my finger.

1368
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:11,583
- Do you see this shit?
- What ring?

1369
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,543
He bought me
a fucking four-carat ring.

1370
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:15,295
Does this look real to you, motherfucker?

1371
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,631
Bet you've never seen one
of these before, have you, huh?

1372
01:10:18,056 --> 01:10:19,733
(in Russian): Take that ring off
her finger.

1373
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:21,468
- (in English): No. No.
- (in Russian): Take it off.

1374
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:23,328
(in English): This is my fucking
ring Ivan gave me.

1375
01:10:23,353 --> 01:10:25,456
- Give me that fucking ring.
- I am not giving you the fucking ring.

1376
01:10:25,481 --> 01:10:27,308
- (in Russian): Take that fucking ring off!
- (in English): You touch me,

1377
01:10:27,334 --> 01:10:29,236
and I will fucking scream, motherfucker.
Do not come for me.

1378
01:10:29,261 --> 01:10:31,479
- Get that fucking ring off of her.
- (speaks Russian)

1379
01:10:32,604 --> 01:10:34,489
- Be careful.
- Hold the legs.

1380
01:10:34,614 --> 01:10:35,741
(in Russian): Careful, bro!

1381
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:42,489
This is Zakharov's property.

1382
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:45,275
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Shut up. Shut up.

1383
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,052
Rape!

1384
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:48,662
Hey, hey, don't scream.

1385
01:10:48,787 --> 01:10:49,871
Hey, what-what is she saying?

1386
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:52,374
- Rape! Rape!
- Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

1387
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:53,875
Is she saying, "Rape"?
Is she...

1388
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,460
What? What? Shut up!

1389
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:56,878
(in Russian): She bites!

1390
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,296
Ouch!

1391
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,006
(in English): Don't go
near to her.

1392
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:01,216
(in Russian): Shut her mouth!

1393
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:02,717
Somebody is going to call the
police!

1394
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:04,511
- How?
- You got to shut her up!

1395
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:06,846
- How? I need a rag or something!
- Motherfucker!

1396
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:08,264
(in English): Shut the fuck up.

1397
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:10,517
Stop screaming.

1398
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:12,769
Please stop screaming.

1399
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:17,256
Please! Stop! Screaming!

1400
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:48,438
You get us
in front of that judge

1401
01:11:48,463 --> 01:11:49,864
first thing in the morning,

1402
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,850
or the family cuts ties
with your firm.

1403
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:53,935
Simple as that.

1404
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:56,146
No, no... no trying.

1405
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:01,017
Everything will be okay.

1406
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:08,724
Yeah.

1407
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:18,918
(in Russian): Time to break this
bitch. Let's go.

1408
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:34,059
(in English): You calm now?

1409
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,020
You gonna behave?

1410
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,775
(in Russian): Careful.

1411
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,530
(in English): Trust me, I know.

1412
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,992
I know what you're thinking.

1413
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,578
You're thinking
this little shit betrayed you.

1414
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:57,540
Well, guess what,
he betrayed me too, okay?

1415
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:58,666
Me too.

1416
01:12:58,792 --> 01:12:59,876
You see?

1417
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:02,212
He betrayed all of us.

1418
01:13:02,637 --> 01:13:05,790
'Cause he's a spoiled brat
that doesn't want to grow up.

1419
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:07,650
Big-time.

1420
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:09,511
And now we're in this mess
that we have to...

1421
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:10,862
we have to fix it together.

1422
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:12,514
You understand?

1423
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:17,477
But I'm gonna help you.

1424
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:19,687
Okay? I'm gonna help you.

1425
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,734
The way I see it, this is
a green card marriage.

1426
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:29,280
Therefore, Ivan owes you
a green card marriage fee.

1427
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:33,401
It's only fair.

1428
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:35,578
So, once this thing
is annulled,

1429
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:39,165
I'm gonna make sure you get
$10,000 fee in cash.

1430
01:13:40,483 --> 01:13:41,859
Hmm?

1431
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:45,713
I'm gonna bring this down,
but no screaming, okay?

1432
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:47,841
If you scream,
this goes right back in.

1433
01:13:47,966 --> 01:13:49,551
You understand?

1434
01:13:59,619 --> 01:14:01,788
Ten K.

1435
01:14:01,913 --> 01:14:04,290
It's as good as you're
gonna get here, honey.

1436
01:14:06,584 --> 01:14:08,253
What do you say?

1437
01:14:12,891 --> 01:14:15,910
I want to talk to Ivan
before agreeing to any of this.

1438
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:17,862
Sure. Of course.

1439
01:14:17,887 --> 01:14:19,514
We all want to talk to Ivan.

1440
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:21,291
We want the same thing.

1441
01:14:28,715 --> 01:14:31,092
Okay, so let's
fucking find Ivan.

1442
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:32,886
All right, but look at me.

1443
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:34,804
Look at me.

1444
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:39,767
Once we find Ivan--
which we will--

1445
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:43,563
and we get this thing
annulled-- which we will--

1446
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:45,732
you're gonna walk away
with ten K fee

1447
01:14:45,857 --> 01:14:48,026
and never, ever
contact Ivan again.

1448
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:49,402
Is that understood?

1449
01:14:54,616 --> 01:14:55,867
Fine.

1450
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:01,998
Untie her.

1451
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:05,043
(in Russian): You got their
marriage license and passport?

1452
01:15:33,871 --> 01:15:35,540
Excuse me,
I have to get dressed.

1453
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:37,583
Can I have some privacy, please?

1454
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,602
Anora Mikheeva?

1455
01:15:47,627 --> 01:15:49,587
Ani. It's Ani.

1456
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:51,089
It says Anora.

1457
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:52,924
I know, but I go by Ani.

1458
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,634
- Thank you.
- Okay, get in.

1459
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:56,052
(in Russian): So I'm done?

1460
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:59,389
You're with us
until we find him. Get in.

1461
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:06,628
(in English): Wait, why is...
why is he getting back here?

1462
01:16:06,653 --> 01:16:09,298
- I'm not sitting next to this fucking psychopath.
- (in Russian): Can I sit in the front?

1463
01:16:09,323 --> 01:16:11,458
- (in English): You are the fucking psychopath.
- Yes, get in the front.

1464
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:13,561
- I don't want to fucking sit next to you.
- I'm not getting back there with you.

1465
01:16:13,587 --> 01:16:14,821
Un-fucking-believable.

1466
01:16:15,713 --> 01:16:17,215
(in Russian): Klara, come here.

1467
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:20,410
It's a bit messier
than usual today.

1468
01:16:20,535 --> 01:16:23,121
So this is for you.
No questions.

1469
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:32,697
(in English): So you're
saying he's gonna be there?

1470
01:16:32,722 --> 01:16:33,890
I have no fucking idea.

1471
01:16:34,615 --> 01:16:35,808
He better be.

1472
01:16:35,833 --> 01:16:37,293
Okay, let's go!

1473
01:16:37,318 --> 01:16:39,570
I need to go to the hospital...
(speaks Armenian)

1474
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:42,473
No, you're okay.
Don't worry about it.

1475
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,142
No, I'm not, bro.

1476
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:47,395
I feel like I have
a concussion or something.

1477
01:16:48,438 --> 01:16:50,690
I'm sorry for what...

1478
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,108
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1479
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:54,826
...was happening back there.

1480
01:16:54,827 --> 01:16:56,426
(in Russian): How could I have imagined...

1481
01:16:56,451 --> 01:16:58,304
I don't want your dude
talking to me, okay?

1482
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:00,874
(in Russian): Leave her the fuck alone, man!

1483
01:17:02,458 --> 01:17:04,510
(in English): My head is pounding, bro.

1484
01:17:05,636 --> 01:17:07,270
- You can't even...
- Shut it, Garnik!

1485
01:17:07,697 --> 01:17:10,908
Oh, my God, we're gonna get
into a fucking car accident

1486
01:17:10,934 --> 01:17:13,210
- with you driving like that.
- Are you suicidal or something?
- Just shut the fuck up.

1487
01:17:13,236 --> 01:17:15,605
- You almost hit that fucking old lady.
- What do you know about driving? What do you know?

1488
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:18,850
- You shut the fuck up.
- (in Russian): Swing by my place and I will
give him something so he'll stop whining.

1489
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:21,555
(in English): You've been bitching and
moaning this entire fucking car ride
about a little fucking scratch on your face.

1490
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:23,440
You're the biggest fucking pussy I ever met.

1491
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,192
(in Russian): Just don't eat
all at once.

1492
01:17:40,106 --> 01:17:42,275
(in English): What the fuck?

1493
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,901
Okay, let's go.
It doesn't matter.

1494
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:45,695
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1495
01:17:50,649 --> 01:17:52,234
A little bit faster.

1496
01:17:52,259 --> 01:17:53,728
Hurry up.

1497
01:18:03,388 --> 01:18:05,181
- Hey, Crystal.
- Hey, Ani.

1498
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:06,883
Hey, have you seen Vanya today?

1499
01:18:07,407 --> 01:18:09,084
No, why? Is everything okay?

1500
01:18:09,152 --> 01:18:12,579
No? Uh, yeah, everything's fine.
Could you give him a call for me, please?

1501
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,530
Okay. What's going on?

1502
01:18:14,554 --> 01:18:16,225
I just need you to call him.

1503
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:18,794
- Can you do me a favor and call him?
- Um...

1504
01:18:19,419 --> 01:18:22,306
Don't ask too many questions.
Just pick up your phone and call him.

1505
01:18:22,331 --> 01:18:24,733
- Okay. Tom? Tom, Ani's here...
- Miss?

1506
01:18:24,758 --> 01:18:28,037
- Hey, Tom. - What's up, Ani?
- Have you seen Vanya today?

1507
01:18:28,762 --> 01:18:30,789
I have not. No.

1508
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:33,390
Okay, has he, like, texted
or called you at all?

1509
01:18:33,415 --> 01:18:35,135
No, not at all. No.

1510
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,895
- Okay, could you just call him right now for me?
- Wait. Who are these dudes?

1511
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,481
- It's fine. I just...
- Can you call Ivan, please?

1512
01:18:39,526 --> 01:18:42,316
- Wait, what's going on? Why would I...
- Just pick up your phone and call him.

1513
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:43,730
I'm not gonna call him.
Who are you?

1514
01:18:43,754 --> 01:18:45,690
Doesn't matter who I am.
I just need you to call him.

1515
01:18:45,715 --> 01:18:47,859
It does matter. I'm not gonna give
you my fucking phone to call Ivan.

1516
01:18:47,884 --> 01:18:49,645
Listen, Ivan is in a lot of trouble.
We need to find him.

1517
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:52,339
Hey, hey, one of you better get
Ivan on the line now.

1518
01:18:54,364 --> 01:18:55,574
"On... on the line"?

1519
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:57,400
- "On the line"?
- What the fuck is funny?

1520
01:18:57,425 --> 01:18:59,445
- Who the fuck are these guys?
- What the fuck is funny, man?

1521
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:01,797
I'm telling you to call Ivan. What's wrong
with that? Don't complicate your life.

1522
01:19:02,022 --> 01:19:04,024
Man, I'm gonna come back there
and just gonna fucking...

1523
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:05,560
I'll complicate your fucking life,
you motherfucker.

1524
01:19:05,585 --> 01:19:09,196
- That's not a good idea. That is not a good idea.
- Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here.

1525
01:19:10,097 --> 01:19:11,473
(in Russian): What's up, man?

1526
01:19:11,598 --> 01:19:14,625
Tough guy. What do you plan
to do with that?

1527
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:16,527
Break your legs,
if you don't get the fuck out.

1528
01:19:17,852 --> 01:19:19,980
(in English): I told you
it's a fucking bad idea.

1529
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:21,940
- Tom.
- So pick up your phone and call him now.

1530
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:25,912
- Whoa, whoa. Fuck off.
- (in Russian): Fucking smash everything.

1531
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:30,766
- What the fuck?
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

1532
01:19:30,892 --> 01:19:33,060
Tell him to fucking stop!
What the fuck?

1533
01:19:33,186 --> 01:19:35,713
- Oh, no.
- Fucking call Ivan now!

1534
01:19:35,738 --> 01:19:37,839
- What the fuck, man?
- Okay, okay. Jesus, fuck!

1535
01:19:37,864 --> 01:19:39,883
- That's crazy.
- Oh, fuck.

1536
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:42,128
- I am so fucked.
- Put it on speaker.

1537
01:19:42,853 --> 01:19:44,814
I am so fucked.

1538
01:19:44,839 --> 01:19:45,965
<i>Please leave your message...</i>

1539
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:47,875
- Where's your phone?
- Hold on, man.

1540
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,418
Just don't break anything,
all right?

1541
01:19:49,443 --> 01:19:50,695
- Call him.
- What the fuck?

1542
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,397
- Put it on speaker.
- There you go. There you go.

1543
01:19:52,422 --> 01:19:53,581
Just don't break anything, man.

1544
01:19:53,606 --> 01:19:55,525
He's not gonna answer the phone.
He's not gonna answer. I know.

1545
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:58,770
<i>- Please leave your message...</i>
- I know it. He's not gonna fucking answer.

1546
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:00,371
Where is his other friend?

1547
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:01,622
Is he with Aleks?

1548
01:20:01,747 --> 01:20:04,208
Aleks is working right now.
He can't be with Aleks.

1549
01:20:04,233 --> 01:20:06,276
- Where is he working?
- Tatiana's.

1550
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:07,353
- Fuck.
- Let's go.

1551
01:20:07,378 --> 01:20:08,888
No. Oh, no.

1552
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:12,390
What the hell?

1553
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:16,145
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Where are you going?

1554
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:17,778
To the car.

1555
01:20:17,802 --> 01:20:19,156
It's five-minute walk.

1556
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,258
- No, no, no. I'm not walking down there.
- Let's drive up there.

1557
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:23,352
- It's fucking freezing.
- No, I'm not gonna look for other parking.
 Come on, let's go.

1558
01:20:23,377 --> 01:20:26,982
- Why don't we drive?
- It's right here. Walk. Chop-chop. Move.

1559
01:20:27,007 --> 01:20:29,025
(in Russian): It's fucking cold, man.
Look at me.

1560
01:20:29,051 --> 01:20:31,127
Are you doing this on purpose?
What the fuck, bro.

1561
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:43,822
(in English): That took way
fucking longer than five minutes.

1562
01:20:44,448 --> 01:20:45,683
Hey.

1563
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:47,251
Table for four?

1564
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:49,512
(in Russian): Is Aleks here?
Aleks?

1565
01:20:49,837 --> 01:20:51,264
Aleks?

1566
01:20:51,389 --> 01:20:52,590
He should be working here.

1567
01:20:52,615 --> 01:20:53,949
- The assistant cook?
- Yes.

1568
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:55,935
- (in English): Let's go.
- No, wait.

1569
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,545
- Hold on. You guys cannot go in there.
- No, you're good. You're good.

1570
01:20:58,571 --> 01:21:00,464
(in Russian): They know
what they're doing, relax.

1571
01:21:02,866 --> 01:21:04,342
- (in English): Oh, my God, Aleks.
- Ani!

1572
01:21:04,368 --> 01:21:07,128
- Have you seen Vanya?
- No. What's going on?

1573
01:21:07,253 --> 01:21:09,172
We're looking for Vanya.
It's a family emergency.

1574
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:11,407
- Have you seen Ivan?
- What the fuck is going on?

1575
01:21:11,432 --> 01:21:12,976
- Have you seen Ivan?
- No.

1576
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:15,245
- (in Russian): I can get fired.
- (in English): You're good. No, you're good.

1577
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:16,546
Don't worry.
Don't worry about it.

1578
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:17,923
- Can you call him, please?
- I haven't seen him.

1579
01:21:17,948 --> 01:21:19,517
- Call him? Really?
- Yes, just call him.

1580
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:21,752
- Yes, please call him. Call him.
- Are you an actress?

1581
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:24,038
- I saw you somewhere? Uh?
- I'm not an actress, no.

1582
01:21:24,063 --> 01:21:26,598
No? You look good.
(in Russian): Where are you from?

1583
01:21:26,623 --> 01:21:28,300
(in English): Give me your phone
one second. One second.

1584
01:21:28,325 --> 01:21:30,136
We can't find Vanya anywhere.
Have you talked to him today?

1585
01:21:30,161 --> 01:21:32,022
No, I haven't saw him.
He's probably at home.

1586
01:21:32,047 --> 01:21:34,390
No, he's not at home, and Tom and Crystal
haven't seen him, either.

1587
01:21:34,616 --> 01:21:36,367
Can I have my phone back, please?
Thank you.

1588
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:38,585
- I need Ivan's photo.
- Okay.

1589
01:21:39,011 --> 01:21:40,979
You got to have your husband's
photo on your phone.

1590
01:21:41,005 --> 01:21:43,641
- No, I am not giving you my phone.
- I need your phone for one second.

1591
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:45,335
- I just need your phone...
- I... No, and you know what?

1592
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,570
If you touch me again,
I will fucking scream.

1593
01:21:47,695 --> 01:21:49,322
(in Russian): Use Instagram.

1594
01:21:49,447 --> 01:21:50,948
(in English): I don't have
Instagram.

1595
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:52,700
I'm an adult, man.
What are you talking about?

1596
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:54,660
You're going to cost me
my job here. Please.

1597
01:21:54,994 --> 01:21:56,329
(in Russian): I have it. Here.

1598
01:21:56,454 --> 01:21:57,830
- (in English): Guys.
- Oh, okay.

1599
01:21:57,955 --> 01:21:59,415
- Ani, what's-what's going on?
- We're looking for...

1600
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,709
We're looking for Vanya.
We don't know where he is.

1601
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,252
But it's like,
this nigga's fucking insane.

1602
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,588
Okay, thank you. Where...

1603
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:08,174
Where are you going?

1604
01:22:13,471 --> 01:22:15,030
You think that
he would be with Dasha?

1605
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:17,642
Not unless he's
in Bahamas with her

1606
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:19,960
and her new fuck boy.

1607
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:23,581
Stop the music one second.
Stop the music.

1608
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:27,193
(in Russian): Excuse me, I'm
terribly sorry.

1609
01:22:27,318 --> 01:22:29,445
But I need one minute
of your attention.

1610
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:33,074
We are looking for
a missing child, a sick child.

1611
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,409
I'm going to show you his photo.

1612
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:38,120
Any information
would be greatly appreciated.

1613
01:22:38,245 --> 01:22:41,082
<i>We're the ones fucking paying
and he wants attention?</i>

1614
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:44,585
My apologies,
but the kid is very sick.

1615
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:47,463
Please let us know
if you've seen him.

1616
01:22:48,214 --> 01:22:49,715
You didn't see him?

1617
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:54,086
- Give me a cigarette.
- Are you kidding me?

1618
01:22:54,111 --> 01:22:57,072
I'm freezing,
and this guy wants cigarettes.

1619
01:22:57,348 --> 01:22:58,974
Toros, seriously...

1620
01:23:05,523 --> 01:23:08,526
(in English): You'll get cold
if you don't cover your neck.

1621
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:13,197
Why did you bring that?

1622
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,867
Why the fuck
did you bring that?

1623
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:20,371
Why? So you could
fucking gag me again?

1624
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:22,181
Motherfucker.

1625
01:23:37,062 --> 01:23:39,773
Fuck it. Give me the scarf.

1626
01:24:05,299 --> 01:24:07,668
No! No! No!

1627
01:24:07,692 --> 01:24:09,343
(in Russian): Swear to God!

1628
01:24:09,569 --> 01:24:12,106
(in English): Hey! Hey! This is my car!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1629
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:14,791
- No, no, no.
- Man, it's already attached.

1630
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:16,493
- Please.
- It's already attached. I got to take it.

1631
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:18,837
- I got to take it in.
- Don't take my car. Don't do that.

1632
01:24:18,862 --> 01:24:21,565
- This is my business situation...
- Hey! Listen to me. Hey! It's your fault!

1633
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:23,892
You were parked in the middle
of the fucking street, okay?

1634
01:24:23,917 --> 01:24:26,019
My friend, I was just parking!
There is no sign.

1635
01:24:26,044 --> 01:24:27,554
- I'll give you money. How much?
- Listen to me.

1636
01:24:27,579 --> 01:24:30,590
- 100, 200, 300? Tell me.
- Listen, down in the yard you're
gonna talk to people, okay?

1637
01:24:31,058 --> 01:24:32,376
- Take the money.
- You're gonna talk...

1638
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:34,328
- Fuck you, then. Fuck you.
- What do you mean, fuck me?

1639
01:24:34,553 --> 01:24:36,230
- Fuck you.
- What the... I don't give a shit.

1640
01:24:36,255 --> 01:24:37,582
- Hey.
- Get the fuck out of my way.

1641
01:24:37,607 --> 01:24:38,892
You get out the fucking car!

1642
01:24:39,117 --> 01:24:40,560
You fucking asked for this.

1643
01:24:45,698 --> 01:24:47,850
I've been on the job
two fucking weeks, bro!

1644
01:24:48,475 --> 01:24:51,053
What the fuck are you...
Are you fucking kidding?

1645
01:24:51,078 --> 01:24:52,329
Fucking kidding me!

1646
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:54,156
- Oh, my fucking God.
- Jesus Christ!

1647
01:24:54,181 --> 01:24:56,383
- Are you fucking...
- It's all because of you.

1648
01:24:56,409 --> 01:24:58,077
- It's all because of you.
- Fuck you!

1649
01:24:58,102 --> 01:24:59,954
- Get in the car! Come on! Come on!
- You are so fucked.

1650
01:24:59,979 --> 01:25:03,274
I have your license plate. If you
get in that car, you're all fucked.

1651
01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:04,651
No, no, no, no, no!

1652
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:07,061
What the fuck are you doing?

1653
01:25:07,286 --> 01:25:08,746
Fuck you, Russians!

1654
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:10,706
- God.
- Jesus Christ.

1655
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:13,067
You guys are fucking crazy.

1656
01:25:13,392 --> 01:25:14,643
We're going to find this fucker

1657
01:25:14,668 --> 01:25:16,804
even if it takes
all fucking night.

1658
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:19,824
(in Russian): I swear on my
mother's life...

1659
01:25:19,949 --> 01:25:22,660
What the fuck did you just do?

1660
01:25:24,662 --> 01:25:26,705
(in English): Come on, give me
something. Like, something.

1661
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:28,357
- Some... Where would you...
- I don't know. I don't know.

1662
01:25:28,482 --> 01:25:30,084
Think. Think. Where?

1663
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:31,669
He... Gaming.
He likes video games.

1664
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:34,380
Maybe he'll be at an arcade
or something. I don't know.

1665
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:39,969
(in Russian): Hurry up.
Stay awake, man.

1666
01:25:40,594 --> 01:25:43,556
Guys,
anybody see this guy today?

1667
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:46,642
Have you seen Vanya Zakharov?

1668
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:47,935
(responds in Russian)

1669
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,604
Guys, see this kid today?

1670
01:25:51,856 --> 01:25:53,190
(in English): Oh! Billiard hall.

1671
01:25:53,315 --> 01:25:54,608
There-there is
the billiard hall.

1672
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:56,360
Remember five years ago we...

1673
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:58,404
you-you were teaching him
how to play billiard?

1674
01:25:58,529 --> 01:26:00,281
We played here,
right here around the corner.

1675
01:26:00,406 --> 01:26:02,449
- You remember?
- Five years ago?

1676
01:26:02,575 --> 01:26:03,868
I remember.

1677
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:08,581
Come, come.
One second, my friend.

1678
01:26:08,706 --> 01:26:10,491
Look at this picture.
Have you seen this guy?

1679
01:26:10,516 --> 01:26:11,642
- Ivan, Ivan.

1680
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:12,835
- Is that Vanya?
- Yeah.

1681
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,086
Have you seen him today?

1682
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:15,546
- No, not today.
- No.

1683
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:17,256
He does the greatest
parties, though.

1684
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:18,465
Yeah, he's really cool.

1685
01:26:18,591 --> 01:26:21,093
(in Armenian): I hate
this bitch so much,

1686
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:23,470
I want to vomit
when I see her face.

1687
01:26:23,596 --> 01:26:26,056
<i>(in English): Please leave your message...</i>

1688
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:28,142
Guys, have you seen this guy?

1689
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:30,311
He's missing. He's been missing.

1690
01:26:31,737 --> 01:26:32,946
You sure?

1691
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:34,857
(in Russian): Let me ask them.

1692
01:26:34,982 --> 01:26:37,401
- Wait, stop.
- Give me a second.

1693
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:40,112
(in English): Guys, have
you seen this... this guy today?

1694
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:41,697
No.

1695
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,201
(in Russian): He's probably not
lost, perhaps he is kidnapped.

1696
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:49,455
Yeah sure, kidnapped...
Of course.

1697
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:54,193
(in English): Think, think,
think, think.

1698
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,170
And can you keep
calling him, please?

1699
01:27:00,649 --> 01:27:01,850
(in Russian): What the fuck?

1700
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:03,861
- (in English): Oh, my God.
- Oh, you got to be...

1701
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:06,138
- ...fucking kidding me!
- Jesus fucking Christ.

1702
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:10,809
You understand that my wife
has to drive this car tomorrow?

1703
01:27:10,935 --> 01:27:12,394
Do you?

1704
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:15,356
How am I gonna get rid
of this smell? Huh?

1705
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:18,859
(in Russian): It's better
you go back to Yerevan.

1706
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:21,862
Fucking get rid of you.

1707
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:23,489
Do you want to blow us up?

1708
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:25,574
- I'm careful.
- Fuck off!

1709
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:26,951
Get the fuck out of here!

1710
01:27:29,945 --> 01:27:31,655
You care about
Ivan more than me.

1711
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,515
Start cleaning!

1712
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:37,294
Who's more important?
Ivan or your dying brother?

1713
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:39,913
(in English): Yeah, I'm not
getting back in there.

1714
01:27:39,946 --> 01:27:42,324
(in Russian): Fuck Ivan.
Fuck that little bitch.

1715
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:44,818
(in English): It still fucking
stinks in here.

1716
01:27:45,043 --> 01:27:47,288
Fuck, I know. Shit!

1717
01:27:49,756 --> 01:27:51,925
Which clubs did you go
with him?

1718
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:53,285
- I don't know. We went to...
- Huh?

1719
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:55,437
I don't know.
We went to a lot of 'em.

1720
01:27:55,662 --> 01:27:57,247
Take me to every single one.

1721
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:01,610
Hey, have you seen
this guy today?

1722
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:04,446
Yeah, we cut him off.
He was wasted.

1723
01:28:04,871 --> 01:28:05,898
When?

1724
01:28:05,923 --> 01:28:07,583
Like 20 minutes ago.

1725
01:28:08,108 --> 01:28:09,276
He just left.

1726
01:28:09,301 --> 01:28:11,762
Have you guys seen
this guy today?

1727
01:28:13,213 --> 01:28:14,056
No?

1728
01:28:14,081 --> 01:28:16,291
(in Russian): Did you ask about
Ivan Zakharov?

1729
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:19,878
- He left me an $800 bill.
- Where is he now?

1730
01:28:20,004 --> 01:28:22,381
How should I know?
But somebody has to pay me.

1731
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:25,050
- (in English): Okay, bye.
- No, wait. But you know him.

1732
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:26,552
I told him my apologies.

1733
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:28,137
You can tell him one more time.

1734
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:30,055
I'm gonna definitely
make them up to you.

1735
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:32,049
Or up to them, or up to you.

1736
01:28:33,617 --> 01:28:35,536
Wh-What can I do?

1737
01:28:35,561 --> 01:28:37,312
Wh-What do you want me to do?

1738
01:28:37,438 --> 01:28:39,298
He's fine.

1739
01:28:39,732 --> 01:28:42,067
(in Russian): Tell his mom
that everything is fine,

1740
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:43,360
he's sitting next to me.

1741
01:28:43,385 --> 01:28:45,612
(in English): Is it a real mink?

1742
01:28:45,637 --> 01:28:48,115
(in Russian): I'm telling you...
I can't talk anymore. I have to go.

1743
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:49,516
(in English): No.

1744
01:28:49,742 --> 01:28:51,585
(in Russian): Please, I'm begging you.
Please stop.

1745
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:54,437
(in English): It looks like real mink.

1746
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:56,106
Of course I do. Why you...

1747
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,817
Yeah, it's fucking
real, but it's not mink.

1748
01:28:58,842 --> 01:29:01,745
- (in Russian): I'm the godfather of that child.
- (in English): It's fucking Russian sable, okay?

1749
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:03,438
Which is worth
a lot more than mink.

1750
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:04,882
(in Russian): Of course I'm
ashamed.

1751
01:29:05,007 --> 01:29:06,258
(in English): No, don't-don't ta...

1752
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:07,301
don't talk about that baby.

1753
01:29:07,426 --> 01:29:09,470
Guys, have you seen
this guy today?

1754
01:29:12,306 --> 01:29:14,767
- (in Russian): End of the line.
- I just have a question.

1755
01:29:14,892 --> 01:29:16,727
Have you seen this kid?

1756
01:29:17,061 --> 01:29:18,937
Yeah,
he was here 30 minutes ago.

1757
01:29:19,063 --> 01:29:20,606
He was too drunk to enter.

1758
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:22,691
- Do you know where he went?
- Who the fuck knows.

1759
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:24,276
(in English): Your I.D., please.

1760
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:26,528
(in Armenian): What a shitty
godfather you are.

1761
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:29,198
Instead of protecting the child,
you just left him.

1762
01:29:29,323 --> 01:29:31,158
Are you fucking with me?

1763
01:29:31,283 --> 01:29:33,494
(in Russian): Maybe he's on a bender.

1764
01:29:34,912 --> 01:29:37,706
(in Armenian): If you're so
competent, why did you let him leave?

1765
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:39,541
(in Russian): How do you say bender?

1766
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:41,335
(in English): Uh, "bender."

1767
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:44,046
It-it's a bender. Yeah.

1768
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:47,249
(in Armenian): Tor, what does
that have to do with competence?

1769
01:29:47,274 --> 01:29:50,035
Fuck this shit.
I didn't sign up for this.

1770
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:54,098
I just want to go home
to Armenia. This sucks.

1771
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:21,710
Bitch!

1772
01:30:22,835 --> 01:30:24,878
(in English): I'm so fucked.

1773
01:30:26,213 --> 01:30:28,173
So fucked!

1774
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:36,098
You know, he fucked me
much harder than he fucked you.

1775
01:30:36,223 --> 01:30:38,350
- Oh, yeah?
- Hundred percent.

1776
01:30:39,393 --> 01:30:41,061
Trust me.

1777
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:44,857
If we haven't found him by now,
we are not finding him.

1778
01:30:44,982 --> 01:30:47,985
Did I ask you? Did I ask you?

1779
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:49,820
(in Russian): I'm just saying, man.

1780
01:30:49,945 --> 01:30:51,405
(in English): Keep your opinion
to yourself.

1781
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:54,324
(in Russian): I'm not going to
talk at all from now on.

1782
01:31:02,474 --> 01:31:04,384
(in English): Ani's fucking
billionaire husband

1783
01:31:04,409 --> 01:31:06,411
just strolled in,
and he's looking for action.

1784
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:08,480
And I'm gonna give him some.

1785
01:31:08,805 --> 01:31:10,182
Vanya?

1786
01:31:10,607 --> 01:31:12,009
Vanya.

1787
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:13,677
You know, it's so sad.

1788
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:16,346
That marriage must really be
in the toilet already.

1789
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:17,514
Vanya's here?

1790
01:31:19,433 --> 01:31:21,101
'Scuse!

1791
01:31:22,603 --> 01:31:25,063
- Have you seen this guy today?
- No.

1792
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:26,773
How about you, sir?

1793
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:29,401
(in Russian): Igor, thank you
for the pills.

1794
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:35,699
(in English): I want what he
had. I want one of those.

1795
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:47,878
Did you fucking hear me?
I said, "I want one of those."

1796
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:51,873
No.

1797
01:31:52,357 --> 01:31:53,358
No?

1798
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:55,219
What the fuck? Why?

1799
01:31:55,344 --> 01:31:57,387
'Cause I don't deal drugs.

1800
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,640
A fucking gopnik who can afford
to live in Brightwater

1801
01:31:59,765 --> 01:32:01,141
and doesn't deal drugs?

1802
01:32:01,366 --> 01:32:02,784
Yeah, right.

1803
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:06,763
It's my grandmother's apartment
and her drugs.

1804
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:24,039
I don't have any more,
and I'm not gopnik.

1805
01:32:25,323 --> 01:32:26,450
Yeah, you're right.

1806
01:32:26,475 --> 01:32:28,727
You're a faggot-ass bitch,
is what you are.

1807
01:32:29,086 --> 01:32:31,338
Hey, guys, have you seen
this guy today?

1808
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:32,756
No.

1809
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:35,592
(in Russian): What does
faggot-ass bitch mean?

1810
01:32:36,593 --> 01:32:38,637
Fucking faggot.

1811
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:40,681
(in English): Yep, what he said.

1812
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:44,985
(in Russian): Go away!

1813
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:47,121
Why are you being rude?
I'm just asking a question.

1814
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:48,474
I don't give a shit.

1815
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:52,651
(in English): And why am I
faggot-ass bitch?

1816
01:32:54,644 --> 01:32:55,921
I don't know.

1817
01:32:55,946 --> 01:32:58,115
They say you're
just born that way.

1818
01:33:02,594 --> 01:33:04,971
You know what, I'm so
sick of your generation, man.

1819
01:33:04,997 --> 01:33:06,331
I mean, look at you.

1820
01:33:06,756 --> 01:33:08,166
No respect for elder,

1821
01:33:08,292 --> 01:33:10,961
no respect for authority,
no goals.

1822
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:13,463
I mean, the only goal you have
just to buy

1823
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:15,132
pair of cool sneakers.
That's all.

1824
01:33:15,257 --> 01:33:16,550
I mean, honestly. Come on.

1825
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:18,135
What the fuck
is wrong with you? Huh?

1826
01:33:19,678 --> 01:33:23,515
(in Russian): Why don't you just
hear me out?

1827
01:33:24,949 --> 01:33:26,493
(in English): No work ethics.

1828
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:28,020
Lazy, stupid.

1829
01:33:28,245 --> 01:33:29,538
I don't understand.

1830
01:33:29,663 --> 01:33:32,374
I've been working
since I'm 16 years old.

1831
01:33:32,699 --> 01:33:34,593
What is wrong with you?

1832
01:33:35,218 --> 01:33:37,846
All you do is TikTok,
Instagram, TikTok, Instagram.

1833
01:33:37,871 --> 01:33:38,788
That's it.

1834
01:33:38,913 --> 01:33:39,998
He's at HQ!

1835
01:33:40,623 --> 01:33:41,407
What?

1836
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:42,988
Fucking Headquarters!

1837
01:33:45,278 --> 01:33:46,237
Hey.

1838
01:33:46,961 --> 01:33:47,806
Hello.

1839
01:33:48,031 --> 01:33:50,308
- What's the address?
- West 38th Street.

1840
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:52,869
- Whoo! I fucking love that place.
- You mean fucking Manhattan?

1841
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:54,371
Yeah, it's in
fucking Manhattan.

1842
01:33:54,396 --> 01:33:55,647
Oh, my fucking God.
(speaks Russian)

1843
01:33:55,672 --> 01:33:57,007
- Hurry up!
- Oh, I need cash.

1844
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:58,050
Toros!

1845
01:33:58,175 --> 01:33:59,551
- That's 45 minutes away.
Hurry up.

1846
01:34:00,577 --> 01:34:02,320
Beautiful.

1847
01:34:02,346 --> 01:34:04,389
You're Vanya, right?

1848
01:34:04,814 --> 01:34:05,740
Yeah, that's me.

1849
01:34:05,766 --> 01:34:07,012
Anora.

1850
01:34:08,036 --> 01:34:08,743
Anora!

1851
01:34:08,769 --> 01:34:11,229
It's not Anora. It's Ani.

1852
01:34:11,355 --> 01:34:14,358
Tell your friend to hold him
there at any cost.

1853
01:34:14,683 --> 01:34:16,710
Even if they have to
physically hold him.

1854
01:34:16,735 --> 01:34:18,445
Like, grab him really.

1855
01:34:30,491 --> 01:34:32,784
- More? More?
- More, more.

1856
01:34:32,909 --> 01:34:36,187
Because you have the best skin
that I ever touch.

1857
01:34:43,296 --> 01:34:45,215
- I love you. I love you.
- How do you say...

1858
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:47,591
- In Russian?
- (speaks Russian)

1859
01:34:52,887 --> 01:34:54,347
So, don't have a heart attack,

1860
01:34:54,372 --> 01:34:57,584
but Vanya's upstairs
in a private with Diamond.

1861
01:34:57,609 --> 01:34:59,694
Ani, who the hell
are these guys?

1862
01:35:23,535 --> 01:35:24,878
Vanya?

1863
01:35:25,887 --> 01:35:27,597
Where is...
He's in one of these rooms?

1864
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:29,282
Yeah.

1865
01:35:31,042 --> 01:35:32,870
Shit. Sorry.

1866
01:35:33,395 --> 01:35:35,063
- Sorry. Sorry, Daisy.
- Hey, Ani.

1867
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:36,690
Vanya? Oh, shit.

1868
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:38,358
Carla, have you seen Diamond?

1869
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:40,610
I think she's in the pole room.
Hey, what's going...

1870
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:41,945
- What's pole room?
- Fucking pole room.

1871
01:35:45,991 --> 01:35:47,884
- Vanya?
- Oh, what the fuck?

1872
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:50,120
Oh, get the fuck off
my fucking husband.

1873
01:35:50,445 --> 01:35:53,306
- You fucking mad?
- Yeah, I am about to be fucking mad, bitch.

1874
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:54,833
- Skip out, ho.
- Let's go!

1875
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:56,585
- Oh, you want to fucking go?
- You fucking bitch.

1876
01:35:56,710 --> 01:35:59,087
- Yeah, come get some, bitch.
- (in Russian): We're running around all night

1877
01:35:59,212 --> 01:36:00,889
and this fucking guy is here getting
his rocks off.

1878
01:36:00,914 --> 01:36:03,417
(in English): Nice to see you guys.
(in Russian): We were looking for you all night, you fuck!

1879
01:36:03,442 --> 01:36:06,655
- Vanya, we've been fucking looking for you. All night!
- (in English): I've been texting. I've been fucking calling you.

1880
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,891
Why haven't you answered
any of my fucking calls?

1881
01:36:09,016 --> 01:36:11,493
- You little son of a bitch.
- Why'd you fucking leave me, Vanya?

1882
01:36:11,518 --> 01:36:15,738
I tried to run after you. These guys, they fucking
tied my wrists up. They took my ring.

1883
01:36:15,863 --> 01:36:18,357
- For what, bro?
- They fucking assaulted me, Vanya.

1884
01:36:18,382 --> 01:36:20,593
Okay, get up. Let's go.
You can talk in the car. Get up.

1885
01:36:20,651 --> 01:36:23,246
No, I fucking found him,
so I get to fucking talk to him.

1886
01:36:23,271 --> 01:36:25,607
- Okay? That was the deal.
- Vanya, our hour's not over.

1887
01:36:25,632 --> 01:36:27,633
Oh, get her
the fuck out of here!

1888
01:36:27,658 --> 01:36:29,902
Oh, get the fuck out
of my private, bitch!

1889
01:36:31,027 --> 01:36:33,471
- Vanya, look at me.
- I am looking at you.

1890
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:34,547
I'm coming back, bitch.

1891
01:36:35,572 --> 01:36:37,475
- Fuck you, Diamond.
- This is very important.

1892
01:36:37,501 --> 01:36:38,543
Vanya, look at me.

1893
01:36:38,868 --> 01:36:40,161
Just listen to me, baby, listen.

1894
01:36:40,186 --> 01:36:42,430
These guys, they want us
to get a divorce, okay?

1895
01:36:42,555 --> 01:36:43,607
It's not divorce.

1896
01:36:43,632 --> 01:36:45,684
- I told you hundred times.
- Back off. Let me...

1897
01:36:45,709 --> 01:36:47,360
It's annulment. Annulment.

1898
01:36:48,185 --> 01:36:50,947
Vanya, tell them that we're
not gonna get a divorce, okay?

1899
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:53,558
- Tell them that this is a mistake.
- (in Russian): Are my parents here yet?

1900
01:36:53,583 --> 01:36:55,835
- (in English): Baby, this is very important.
- Listen to me here.

1901
01:36:55,860 --> 01:36:57,687
- No, no, no. We...
- Your parents are coming at 12:00.

1902
01:36:57,712 --> 01:36:59,515
I helped you find him,
so let me fucking talk to him.

1903
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,217
(in Russian): We still need
to go to the courthouse!

1904
01:37:01,242 --> 01:37:04,137
(in English): Vanya, just look at me, okay? Fucking
ignore them. It doesn't fucking matter about her.

1905
01:37:04,262 --> 01:37:07,581
It doesn't matter about anything, okay?
Just... I need you to tell them...

1906
01:37:08,706 --> 01:37:10,291
Vanya, this is not funny.

1907
01:37:10,316 --> 01:37:11,818
I know. It's not.

1908
01:37:11,843 --> 01:37:14,387
Vanya, look at me, baby.
Let's stay married, okay?

1909
01:37:14,512 --> 01:37:16,973
Yeah. You know these guys?
Yeah, I love them. I love them.

1910
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:18,624
Jesus, Vanya.

1911
01:37:19,501 --> 01:37:20,835
We have to talk
about this, okay?

1912
01:37:20,961 --> 01:37:22,495
This is very,
very important, all right?

1913
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,522
I don't want to talk
about it right now.

1914
01:37:24,548 --> 01:37:26,174
Okay, but just-just...
Look what he...

1915
01:37:26,499 --> 01:37:28,501
No, no, no, Vanya,
we can't drink right now.

1916
01:37:28,526 --> 01:37:30,195
You need to tell them...
Guys, he's fucking drunk.

1917
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:31,763
We can't talk right... No.

1918
01:37:31,888 --> 01:37:33,056
We're not fucking done talking.

1919
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:34,933
- I wanted to talk to him.
- Come on.

1920
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:36,560
(in Russian): Here we go!

1921
01:37:36,685 --> 01:37:38,895
(in English): Vanya. Vanya.

1922
01:37:41,106 --> 01:37:44,141
Vanya, Vanya, we have to keep
talking about this.

1923
01:37:45,285 --> 01:37:46,286
Vanya!

1924
01:37:46,311 --> 01:37:48,980
Do not fucking touch me! Jesus.

1925
01:37:49,005 --> 01:37:51,216
Vanya, we're not...
we have to keep talking.

1926
01:37:51,241 --> 01:37:53,410
They're trying to bring us
to get a divorce. We can't...

1927
01:37:53,735 --> 01:37:54,844
Do not fucking...

1928
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:56,454
Get the fuck out
of my fucking face.

1929
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:59,783
Jimmy, Ani's here with
three guys causing a scene.

1930
01:38:00,008 --> 01:38:01,175
Russian Ani?

1931
01:38:08,624 --> 01:38:11,127
- I fucking told you.
- Get the fuck out of my fucking face.

1932
01:38:11,152 --> 01:38:12,245
Didn't I? Two weeks.

1933
01:38:12,270 --> 01:38:13,780
On the fucking nose!

1934
01:38:15,806 --> 01:38:17,450
Wrong one, bitch.

1935
01:38:19,377 --> 01:38:21,337
Guys, there's a fucking fight!

1936
01:38:21,362 --> 01:38:23,072
- No way!
- Oh, shit!

1937
01:38:24,497 --> 01:38:25,966
Oh, my God, I love it.

1938
01:38:31,781 --> 01:38:33,492
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1939
01:38:36,077 --> 01:38:37,746
(in Russian): Garnik, do
something!

1940
01:38:41,006 --> 01:38:42,850
DJ (in English): Yo, yo, yo.
Break it up, break it up.

1941
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:44,811
Take it outside.
Take that shit outside.

1942
01:38:45,036 --> 01:38:47,372
There's no fighting at HQ.

1943
01:38:47,497 --> 01:38:49,032
Okay, calm down.

1944
01:38:49,557 --> 01:38:51,134
- Whoa.
- Man, get the fuck out of here!

1945
01:38:51,159 --> 01:38:53,077
- Get the fuck out of here.
- (in Russian): Get in.

1946
01:38:53,102 --> 01:38:55,271
(in English): Get back.
Get the fuck out of here.

1947
01:38:55,296 --> 01:38:57,549
- You told me Ani's one of our girls.
- Go. Go.

1948
01:38:57,783 --> 01:38:59,952
Fucking found you! We found you!

1949
01:39:01,978 --> 01:39:05,148
I can't believe you went
running like a fucking baby.

1950
01:39:05,473 --> 01:39:07,267
But it's okay.
Your parents are coming.

1951
01:39:07,292 --> 01:39:09,143
You're gone.
You're gone, finally.

1952
01:39:09,369 --> 01:39:11,337
- Fucking gone.
- Vanya. Vanya.

1953
01:39:11,363 --> 01:39:12,947
Do you know
what's happening right now?

1954
01:39:13,073 --> 01:39:15,575
Do you fucking know what's
going on right now, Vanya?

1955
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:17,535
- Mm-hmm.
- Get off me, man.

1956
01:39:17,661 --> 01:39:18,745
He's fucking wasted. He-he...

1957
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:20,747
I need to talk to him
when he's fucking sober.

1958
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:22,299
I can't talk to him like this.

1959
01:39:22,524 --> 01:39:23,876
Talking is done.

1960
01:39:23,901 --> 01:39:26,360
Talking is not done. Of course
he's gonna do anything you say.

1961
01:39:26,386 --> 01:39:27,762
He's fucking plastered.

1962
01:39:27,787 --> 01:39:30,789
- Talking is done. Now we're gonna get
this thing done in three hours.
- No, this wasn't the fucking deal.

1963
01:39:30,814 --> 01:39:31,975
Yes, it was.

1964
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,668
Oh, slow down.
I'm gonna get sick.

1965
01:39:33,693 --> 01:39:35,111
We're gonna get
this thing done.

1966
01:39:35,136 --> 01:39:36,629
You're gonna get
your fucking money,

1967
01:39:36,654 --> 01:39:38,573
and you're gonna walk away--
that's it.

1968
01:39:38,598 --> 01:39:39,891
That was the deal.

1969
01:39:42,702 --> 01:39:43,753
Fuck.

1970
01:39:43,778 --> 01:39:45,196
What? You know, you must...

1971
01:39:45,221 --> 01:39:46,681
You must really hate me, man.

1972
01:39:46,706 --> 01:39:48,374
I mean, seriously.

1973
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,111
And after all
I've done for you.

1974
01:39:51,136 --> 01:39:52,770
You know, everything.

1975
01:39:52,796 --> 01:39:54,798
I mean, I bailed you out
how many times?

1976
01:39:54,823 --> 01:39:56,908
Huh? How many times?

1977
01:39:57,433 --> 01:39:59,477
And you do this to me?

1978
01:39:59,703 --> 01:40:01,579
You know, it-it makes me upset.

1979
01:40:01,705 --> 01:40:03,039
You know, it's...
You know how...

1980
01:40:03,164 --> 01:40:05,375
how embarrassing
that is for me?

1981
01:40:07,043 --> 01:40:08,545
Huh?

1982
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:11,589
Are you even listening
to what I'm saying?

1983
01:40:11,715 --> 01:40:14,217
He's passed out, abed.

1984
01:40:18,612 --> 01:40:19,814
Now we wait.

1985
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:36,239
Okay. He's here. Hey.

1986
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:38,074
Wake up. Wake up.

1987
01:40:38,499 --> 01:40:39,625
He's here. Let's go.

1988
01:40:41,152 --> 01:40:42,278
Vanya.

1989
01:40:43,003 --> 01:40:45,207
(in Russian): Wake up,
brother, come out, please.

1990
01:40:45,731 --> 01:40:47,334
(in English): I want to stay in the car.

1991
01:40:48,259 --> 01:40:49,862
Vanya, Vanya, look at me.

1992
01:40:49,886 --> 01:40:51,662
We need to talk before
you go in there, okay?

1993
01:40:51,687 --> 01:40:53,757
(in Russian): Do not get a ticket
and do not get towed.

1994
01:40:53,882 --> 01:40:55,341
(in Russian): Keep your phone on.

1995
01:40:55,667 --> 01:40:58,562
(in English): Vanya, Vanya, don't say
anything when you go in there, okay?

1996
01:40:59,287 --> 01:41:01,530
Vanya, I'm gonna handle this, okay?
I got it.

1997
01:41:01,555 --> 01:41:02,840
Handle what?

1998
01:41:02,866 --> 01:41:05,076
- Don't talk to him.
- None of your fucking business.

1999
01:41:05,201 --> 01:41:06,752
- Let's go.
- Hello, everyone.

2000
01:41:06,778 --> 01:41:08,654
- How are you, sir?
- Toros.

2001
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:11,491
- Stop it, stop it, stop it.
- Whoa, whoa. Is he all right there?

2002
01:41:11,516 --> 01:41:13,718
- Does he fucking look all right to you?
- He is okay.

2003
01:41:13,743 --> 01:41:15,695
He is not fucking all right.
He can barely stand.

2004
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:16,797
How are you?

2005
01:41:16,822 --> 01:41:19,616
Fine, thanks. Uh, the judge
is being very kind,

2006
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:20,992
and he bumped us up.

2007
01:41:21,117 --> 01:41:23,077
- Good.
- Hello, Ivan.

2008
01:41:25,421 --> 01:41:29,309
(in Russian): Ivan, it's Michael
Sharnov, your father's attorney.

2009
01:41:29,334 --> 01:41:32,177
- Remember me?
- You don't remember Uncle Michael?

2010
01:41:32,303 --> 01:41:33,295
(mutters in Russian)

2011
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,780
(in English): He's a little
bit tired. It's okay.

2012
01:41:34,806 --> 01:41:37,000
- I see.
- Tired?

2013
01:41:37,025 --> 01:41:39,152
And this is the...

2014
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:41,930
The lucky lady?

2015
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:45,725
- Okay. And who is this?
- Him we're gonna need.

2016
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:47,227
(in Russian): Just holding.

2017
01:41:48,227 --> 01:41:49,946
(in English): Okay, I don't know
what that means,

2018
01:41:49,971 --> 01:41:51,055
and I don't want to know.

2019
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:52,952
Let's go.
Get your I.D.'s ready.

2020
01:41:54,269 --> 01:41:58,798
(in Russian): I talked to him
and it's clear he wants this done.

2021
01:41:59,122 --> 01:42:01,382
But does he know that
his son is intoxicated?

2022
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:03,827
He's not intoxicated,
he just woke up.

2023
01:42:03,952 --> 01:42:05,495
(in English): Toros, please.
Come on, man.

2024
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,580
I'm not gonna risk my license
because you can't...

2025
01:42:07,705 --> 01:42:09,833
You want to keep working
for Zakharov family or not?

2026
01:42:13,702 --> 01:42:14,996
Oh.

2027
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:17,091
Mr. Sharnov.

2028
01:42:18,015 --> 01:42:20,242
- Consider yourself very fortunate.
- Your Honor.

2029
01:42:20,593 --> 01:42:23,049
We have a light
calendar today, so, um...

2030
01:42:23,473 --> 01:42:25,414
...what's your urgent matter?

2031
01:42:25,857 --> 01:42:29,286
Your Honor,
we are here to file a complaint

2032
01:42:29,311 --> 01:42:33,456
and request for an immediate annulment
of a union that took place under duress.

2033
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:37,359
- Ivan Zakharov and Anora Mikheeva married...
- Duress, my fucking ass.

2034
01:42:37,684 --> 01:42:38,910
Whoa!

2035
01:42:39,253 --> 01:42:42,497
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Your Honor,
but this is bullshit. It's bullshit.

2036
01:42:42,522 --> 01:42:44,432
- Your Honor, I...
- These men are trying to...

2037
01:42:44,457 --> 01:42:46,301
You got to stop. You can't...
You can't talk this way.

2038
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:47,406
Okay. I'm sorry.
They're trying...

2039
01:42:47,630 --> 01:42:49,745
- Do not fucking touch me.
- Who's this man in the camel coat?

2040
01:42:49,770 --> 01:42:51,790
- Who are you, sir?
- Security, please get this man away from me.

2041
01:42:51,815 --> 01:42:54,635
- Mr. Sharnov, is he with you?
- Get the f... Get him away from me.

2042
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:56,662
- Officer, take... take him back to his seat.
- Come on, come on.

2043
01:42:56,687 --> 01:42:58,498
Thank you, Officer. I appreciate it.

2044
01:42:58,523 --> 01:42:59,991
- Okay, have a seat. Have a seat.
- I'm sorry.

2045
01:43:00,016 --> 01:43:02,151
And thank you, Your Honor.
I really appreciate it.

2046
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:03,945
- You're welcome. Keep that tone.
- Okay.

2047
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:05,863
- You're welcome.
- Your Honor, clearly...

2048
01:43:06,089 --> 01:43:07,992
my husband is intoxicated right now.

2049
01:43:08,017 --> 01:43:11,027
- He is in no place to be making any decisions.
- Uh, Your Honor, objection. She shouldn't be talking.

2050
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:12,920
- Don't listen to her, please.
- Camel coat, sit down.

2051
01:43:12,945 --> 01:43:13,988
Down!

2052
01:43:14,014 --> 01:43:16,266
- He is clearly intoxicated, Your Honor.
- Why is she talking?

2053
01:43:16,291 --> 01:43:18,852
Your Honor, what I have been
trying to explain to you,

2054
01:43:18,877 --> 01:43:20,495
we got married legally.

2055
01:43:20,519 --> 01:43:23,656
Objection, Your Honor. They're not legally
married, and she shouldn't be talking.

2056
01:43:23,681 --> 01:43:25,582
- I shouldn't be talking?
- Camel man, sit down.

2057
01:43:25,608 --> 01:43:26,701
My apologies.

2058
01:43:26,726 --> 01:43:29,437
Your Honor, I-I apologize. My client
doesn't know what she's saying. I'm sorry.

2059
01:43:29,662 --> 01:43:32,131
- And they are trying to force us
to get an annulment...
- I-I am intoxicated.

2060
01:43:32,156 --> 01:43:33,808
- Sit quietly or begone. Please.

2061
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:36,369
We got legally married at a legitimate
marriage place in Las Vegas, Nevada.

2062
01:43:36,394 --> 01:43:39,355
- Miss, please keep it down. Keep it down.
- It is real. We have a marriage certificate.

2063
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:41,466
- Mr. Sharnov, take charge now.
- We're not gonna be signing--

2064
01:43:41,491 --> 01:43:43,126
They got married in Nevada?

2065
01:43:43,551 --> 01:43:46,770
- So what?
- (in Russian): We can't get it annulled here.

2066
01:43:46,895 --> 01:43:47,680
What?

2067
01:43:47,705 --> 01:43:51,158
(in Russian): We can file for one but
if you want this now, you have to go there.

2068
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:53,161
(in English): Mr. Sharnov. Last time.

2069
01:43:53,286 --> 01:43:54,663
Are you fucking kidding me?

2070
01:43:54,788 --> 01:43:57,423
- (in English): Folks, get out. Okay that's it.
- (in Russian): My stomach hurts.

2071
01:43:57,849 --> 01:44:01,911
No, no, no. Officer, get him
off the table before he throws up.

2072
01:44:01,936 --> 01:44:02,971
Fuck!

2073
01:44:02,996 --> 01:44:04,806
Get him off the table.
Get him out.

2074
01:44:04,931 --> 01:44:06,991
- Fuck!
- Everyone out of the court.

2075
01:44:07,316 --> 01:44:09,953
- Clear the court, Officer.
- Come on, time to go.

2076
01:44:10,078 --> 01:44:12,122
Officer, clear the court, please.

2077
01:44:12,447 --> 01:44:14,916
Why did you go to Vegas?
Why not here in New York?

2078
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:17,061
Guys, you don't have to
fucking drag him around.

2079
01:44:17,486 --> 01:44:19,146
Why not here in New York?
Can you explain to me?

2080
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:22,051
We got fucking married in Vegas
because that's where he proposed to me.

2081
01:44:22,475 --> 01:44:25,324
So now we're gonna go see your parents.
You're gonna explain to them--

2082
01:44:25,367 --> 01:44:27,870
- that you went to Vegas without my permission.
- No, we're not fucking going anywhere.

2083
01:44:27,895 --> 01:44:30,439
You understand?
Because it wasn't my fault.

2084
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:33,258
- You, too. You're gonna have to tell them that you...
- Oh, no, I am not going fucking anywhere.

2085
01:44:33,284 --> 01:44:35,545
- ...you took him to Vegas without my permission.
- I am not going... No, no, no, no.

2086
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:37,790
This is not my fault.
Get in the car. Get in the car.

2087
01:44:38,067 --> 01:44:40,112
I'm not getting in the fucking car,
'cause we're fucking done here.

2088
01:44:40,237 --> 01:44:42,689
- And I want my fucking ring now, motherfucker.
- (in Russian): You got a ticket?

2089
01:44:42,714 --> 01:44:43,828
Vanya, you don't have to get...

2090
01:44:43,852 --> 01:44:45,766
Vanya, get out of the car, okay?

2091
01:44:45,792 --> 01:44:47,836
You do not have to
listen to these people.

2092
01:44:48,361 --> 01:44:50,838
Okay? You don't have to listen to them
because you're an adult, Vanya.

2093
01:44:51,762 --> 01:44:53,362
You're an adult, okay?

2094
01:44:53,463 --> 01:44:55,507
(in Russian): You had one job
and you get a ticket?

2095
01:44:56,132 --> 01:44:57,910
I must have dozed off.

2096
01:44:58,235 --> 01:45:01,330
(in Russian): You are an adult.
You are an adult.

2097
01:45:01,556 --> 01:45:04,642
I just need to talk with my parents.

2098
01:45:08,628 --> 01:45:10,288
(in English): Okay.

2099
01:45:11,014 --> 01:45:12,265
Okay. All right.

2100
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:14,158
We'll talk to your parents, okay?

2101
01:45:14,183 --> 01:45:15,726
We're gonna talk
to your parents,

2102
01:45:15,751 --> 01:45:17,461
and they're gonna understand
because they love you.

2103
01:45:17,586 --> 01:45:20,265
- (in Russian): Get in.
- What happened?

2104
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:22,608
They got married in Vegas,
that's what happened.

2105
01:45:22,734 --> 01:45:25,111
(in English): They love you, and
they're gonna understand, okay?

2106
01:45:25,236 --> 01:45:27,113
Vanya, okay? Right?

2107
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:29,582
- They're gonna understand, right?
- Get in the car.

2108
01:45:31,383 --> 01:45:33,460
- Get in the car.
- (in Russian): What are we going to do now?

2109
01:45:33,485 --> 01:45:36,263
- This is a never-ending nightmare...
- (in English): Right, Vanya?

2110
01:45:36,789 --> 01:45:37,915
Right?

2111
01:45:38,241 --> 01:45:39,659
Get in the car.

2112
01:46:02,582 --> 01:46:05,459
I want him clean
and presentable in ten minutes.

2113
01:46:06,569 --> 01:46:08,279
And, you, behave.

2114
01:46:15,912 --> 01:46:17,866
(in Russian): Once,

2115
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:23,044
this idiot and his friends decided
to swim in Kool-Aid.

2116
01:46:23,869 --> 01:46:25,154
Vanya.

2117
01:46:25,179 --> 01:46:27,415
Do you know what is it?
It's a juice.

2118
01:46:28,216 --> 01:46:30,384
They were stoned

2119
01:46:30,843 --> 01:46:33,930
and poured four pounds

2120
01:46:34,472 --> 01:46:37,016
of Kool-Aid in the pool.

2121
01:46:37,558 --> 01:46:40,686
They destroyed the whole system.

2122
01:46:40,812 --> 01:46:44,982
Eighty-seven thousand dollars
in damages.

2123
01:47:43,908 --> 01:47:45,534
Hello, Galina Stepanovna.

2124
01:47:45,559 --> 01:47:46,803
Where is he?

2125
01:47:49,272 --> 01:47:50,982
(in English): Okay.

2126
01:47:51,307 --> 01:47:53,058
Showtime.

2127
01:48:01,767 --> 01:48:03,436
(in Russian): Nikolai Zakharov,
how was your flight?

2128
01:48:03,561 --> 01:48:05,188
Face down, ass up.

2129
01:48:05,897 --> 01:48:08,399
I have some bad news.

2130
01:48:08,524 --> 01:48:09,692
Go on.

2131
01:48:10,151 --> 01:48:13,654
- You're not going to be happy.
- I'm already not happy.

2132
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:16,949
What?

2133
01:48:20,219 --> 01:48:21,995
Vanya. Vanya.

2134
01:48:22,797 --> 01:48:25,133
(in Russian): What's wrong with
you? Look at me.

2135
01:48:26,158 --> 01:48:27,618
Are you drunk?

2136
01:48:29,003 --> 01:48:29,795
Damn...

2137
01:48:29,921 --> 01:48:31,422
Garnik, he's drunk.

2138
01:48:31,547 --> 01:48:33,716
Yes, Galina Stepanovna,

2139
01:48:33,841 --> 01:48:36,510
he's not sober,
but it's not our fault.

2140
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:40,514
Mom, I got it,
I'm already embarrassed.

2141
01:48:40,848 --> 01:48:42,225
- So, you're embarrassed?
- Yes.

2142
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:43,684
So, you're embarrassed?

2143
01:48:43,809 --> 01:48:47,563
You made our family
a national disgrace.

2144
01:48:47,688 --> 01:48:49,649
Galina Zakharova,

2145
01:48:50,775 --> 01:48:52,652
I'm Anora.

2146
01:48:56,948 --> 01:49:00,618
It's so wonderful
to finally meet you.

2147
01:49:01,327 --> 01:49:04,455
It's such an honor
to be Ivan's wife

2148
01:49:05,081 --> 01:49:07,441
and a part
of your beautiful family.

2149
01:49:11,629 --> 01:49:13,965
(in English): Ivan is not
your husband,

2150
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:17,051
and you are not part
of this family.

2151
01:49:18,928 --> 01:49:20,746
And your Russian is
embarrassing.

2152
01:49:20,771 --> 01:49:23,574
- (in Russian): Is this from the new collection?
- Yes, new collection.

2153
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:25,393
(in English): Uh, ma'am?

2154
01:49:27,061 --> 01:49:28,312
Ma'am?

2155
01:49:28,437 --> 01:49:30,189
Yes?

2156
01:49:30,314 --> 01:49:32,400
Vanya and I, we are in love,

2157
01:49:32,525 --> 01:49:34,986
and we would like you
to accept that.

2158
01:49:35,111 --> 01:49:37,154
Vanya is not in love with you.

2159
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,073
Understand?

2160
01:49:39,198 --> 01:49:40,825
And we will not
accept it, okay?

2161
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:41,993
Galina.

2162
01:49:44,787 --> 01:49:47,540
(in Russian): Toros has
something to tell you.

2163
01:49:49,133 --> 01:49:50,810
(in English): Fuck.

2164
01:49:50,835 --> 01:49:52,962
You are all idiots.

2165
01:49:53,087 --> 01:49:55,164
Vanya, we cannot get
on the fucking plane right now.

2166
01:49:55,289 --> 01:49:57,717
Toros, we will discuss
your future in our company.

2167
01:49:57,842 --> 01:50:01,145
Vanya, why are you listening
to your fucking parents?

2168
01:50:02,070 --> 01:50:03,447
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

2169
01:50:03,472 --> 01:50:05,265
Vanya, we have to talk
right fucking now, okay?

2170
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:07,218
(in Russian): Kolya,
hang up the phone already!

2171
01:50:07,243 --> 01:50:08,744
(in English): Vanya, we have to
fucking talk.

2172
01:50:08,769 --> 01:50:10,938
No, no, no, no.
Go back to the plane.

2173
01:50:11,063 --> 01:50:14,900
(in Russian): I want us refueled
and in the air in ten minutes.

2174
01:50:15,568 --> 01:50:17,862
(in English): Vanya, fucking
look at me. Vanya.

2175
01:50:21,574 --> 01:50:24,702
Vanya, be a fucking man
and talk to me!

2176
01:50:24,827 --> 01:50:27,455
(in Russian): Is it necessary to
take the night butterfly with us?

2177
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:31,125
Yes, both parties
must be present.

2178
01:50:36,955 --> 01:50:38,832
(in English): What do you want
me to say?

2179
01:50:43,763 --> 01:50:45,806
Can you understand
that now we must go

2180
01:50:45,931 --> 01:50:50,019
in the fucking plane
and fly to fucking Vegas?

2181
01:50:51,103 --> 01:50:52,605
Get it?

2182
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:55,941
You get it?

2183
01:50:56,067 --> 01:50:58,277
So we're getting a divorce?
You...

2184
01:50:58,402 --> 01:51:00,821
Of course! Are you stupid?

2185
01:51:11,749 --> 01:51:13,376
(in Russian): Ivan, hurry up!

2186
01:51:13,501 --> 01:51:14,919
One second.

2187
01:51:17,871 --> 01:51:19,415
(in English): And thank you...

2188
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:26,389
...for making my last trip
to America so fun.

2189
01:51:33,104 --> 01:51:35,189
Yeah? You had fun?

2190
01:51:36,607 --> 01:51:37,917
Yeah.

2191
01:51:38,142 --> 01:51:39,685
Let's go.

2192
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:55,709
(in Russian): Where is she?

2193
01:51:56,127 --> 01:51:58,045
I don't know, there.

2194
01:52:03,901 --> 01:52:06,070
(in English): Board the plane now.

2195
01:52:09,114 --> 01:52:10,658
No.

2196
01:52:11,559 --> 01:52:13,519
No, I'm not doing that.

2197
01:52:20,067 --> 01:52:24,613
You are getting on this plane,
and you are getting divorced.

2198
01:52:27,741 --> 01:52:29,785
Yeah, we're gonna get
a fucking divorce,

2199
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:32,329
but, uh, first,
I'm getting a lawyer.

2200
01:52:33,372 --> 01:52:35,624
Then I'm gonna sue Ivan
and you,

2201
01:52:35,749 --> 01:52:37,418
and I'm gonna walk away
with fucking half

2202
01:52:37,543 --> 01:52:39,378
because I didn't sign a prenup.

2203
01:52:50,798 --> 01:52:54,760
Do that,
and you'll lose everything.

2204
01:52:56,103 --> 01:52:58,272
Any money you may have--

2205
01:52:58,397 --> 01:53:00,941
although I doubt
you have much--

2206
01:53:01,066 --> 01:53:02,776
will be gone.

2207
01:53:04,028 --> 01:53:05,946
Do you have a house?

2208
01:53:07,573 --> 01:53:09,700
Do you have a car?

2209
01:53:11,243 --> 01:53:12,912
All gone.

2210
01:53:15,681 --> 01:53:18,684
Your life and the lives
of your family and friends,

2211
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:20,586
everything will be destroyed.

2212
01:53:28,385 --> 01:53:30,513
(quiet chatter in Russian)

2213
01:53:33,432 --> 01:53:35,434
(in Russian): You want to talk
about it now?

2214
01:53:35,559 --> 01:53:38,020
- Yes.
- Because I don't.

2215
01:53:40,481 --> 01:53:43,234
Please show some respect,
I'm hungover.

2216
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:47,655
If we were your age, and if
we had everything we wanted...

2217
01:53:47,780 --> 01:53:49,823
Listen, you little shit.

2218
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:52,326
Next week,

2219
01:53:52,751 --> 01:53:54,444
you start working.

2220
01:53:56,472 --> 01:53:58,140
Understand, little shit?

2221
01:53:58,165 --> 01:54:00,042
Why do you need me there?

2222
01:54:00,376 --> 01:54:05,297
Maybe it's not the right moment
but I just want to say...

2223
01:54:06,048 --> 01:54:07,800
I'm very happy to finally

2224
01:54:07,925 --> 01:54:11,428
be able to spend time
with your wonderful family...

2225
01:54:11,554 --> 01:54:15,015
Thank you so much
for trusting me and Toros...

2226
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:17,935
Stop it, get out of here.
Are you crazy?

2227
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:21,605
I want to say a couple
of nice things to them.

2228
01:54:26,485 --> 01:54:28,696
Better you married a man.

2229
01:54:29,029 --> 01:54:31,407
So what if I married a man?
Do you think that can't happen?

2230
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:36,120
Then what kind of freedom
can we talk about?

2231
01:54:36,245 --> 01:54:39,498
If I can't
potentially marry a man?

2232
01:54:39,623 --> 01:54:41,333
- Galina Stepanovna, I just...
- Listen!

2233
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:44,744
I'm sorry, I just want to
use this moment...

2234
01:54:44,768 --> 01:54:47,154
...to say thank you...

2235
01:54:47,579 --> 01:54:51,710
Don't interfere!
We are having a family discussion.

2236
01:54:53,012 --> 01:54:54,555
So you think it's normal?

2237
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:56,056
Everything that happened
is normal?

2238
01:54:56,181 --> 01:54:58,434
How did you end up in Vegas?

2239
01:54:59,852 --> 01:55:01,353
(in English): I understand...

2240
01:55:01,578 --> 01:55:03,905
and forgive you what you did.

2241
01:55:03,930 --> 01:55:06,166
(in Russian): I just bought a ticket
and flew to Vegas! Why can't I do that?

2242
01:55:06,191 --> 01:55:08,319
- Who gave you permission?
- Who would forbid me?

2243
01:55:09,144 --> 01:55:10,495
(in English): Great.

2244
01:55:10,948 --> 01:55:13,191
I'm so grateful
for your forgiveness.

2245
01:55:13,916 --> 01:55:16,418
(in Russian): Why can't I just
fly to Vegas?

2246
01:55:16,543 --> 01:55:17,953
Because you went to study.

2247
01:55:18,245 --> 01:55:20,614
Not to party,
drink and get hungover.

2248
01:55:22,041 --> 01:55:24,960
Why make a tragedy out of it?

2249
01:55:25,085 --> 01:55:29,089
What do you want from me?
Do you want me to apologize?

2250
01:55:29,214 --> 01:55:30,966
Just kill me, mom!

2251
01:55:31,091 --> 01:55:34,595
What did I do? I just spent
time with an escort.

2252
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:37,848
I just spent a week with her.
So what's the big deal?

2253
01:55:37,973 --> 01:55:39,808
Why are you making this
such a big deal?

2254
01:55:39,933 --> 01:55:41,727
This isn't our family's
biggest problem.

2255
01:55:41,852 --> 01:55:42,853
Sit!

2256
01:55:42,978 --> 01:55:44,538
It's not going to be
a fucking problem.

2257
01:55:44,563 --> 01:55:45,689
I breast-fed you!

2258
01:55:45,814 --> 01:55:48,725
(in English): I'm fucking glad
to be divorcing your sorry ass.

2259
01:55:48,751 --> 01:55:50,327
You are fucking pathetic, man.

2260
01:55:50,552 --> 01:55:51,836
Are you seriously?

2261
01:55:51,862 --> 01:55:54,072
You're a pathetic motherfucker.

2262
01:55:54,907 --> 01:55:55,908
Fucking pathetic.

2263
01:55:56,033 --> 01:55:57,576
You're a pathetic motherfucker.

2264
01:55:57,701 --> 01:55:58,911
- Blyat, no.
- See?

2265
01:56:01,705 --> 01:56:03,832
(in Russian): You hurt your
mother so much!

2266
01:56:04,249 --> 01:56:06,585
I gave you everything.

2267
01:56:08,812 --> 01:56:11,315
Kolya,
give me your hand, please.

2268
01:57:13,610 --> 01:57:15,571
(in English): I'm just
going to need some signatures.

2269
01:57:15,696 --> 01:57:17,364
If I could just
get that back from...

2270
01:57:17,489 --> 01:57:19,241
Actually, if I could just
hang on to all...

2271
01:57:19,366 --> 01:57:20,826
- Could I just... Thank you.
- Okay, question.

2272
01:57:20,951 --> 01:57:23,278
- Okay. Yes, of course.
- What this mean?

2273
01:57:23,303 --> 01:57:24,804
We don't need
to worry about that.

2274
01:57:24,829 --> 01:57:27,165
- That's for the judge, so...
- Are you sure?

2275
01:57:27,190 --> 01:57:29,025
Um... Very sure.

2276
01:57:29,051 --> 01:57:31,344
Okay, so we're just gonna need
some signatures here.

2277
01:57:31,370 --> 01:57:33,163
So there you go,
and this one will be for...

2278
01:57:33,188 --> 01:57:34,773
(in Russian): Come here.

2279
01:57:34,798 --> 01:57:36,592
(in English): Sorry, I'm gonna
mispronounce your name.

2280
01:57:36,717 --> 01:57:38,427
- Sign.
- So, Anora Mikheeva,

2281
01:57:38,552 --> 01:57:40,596
I just need
your signature as well.

2282
01:57:40,721 --> 01:57:43,015
Thank you. Oh, oh.

2283
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:44,308
There you are.

2284
01:57:45,742 --> 01:57:47,369
Where the red box is.

2285
01:57:59,506 --> 01:58:01,567
Sign, please.

2286
01:58:10,150 --> 01:58:12,235
And then--
oh, sorry-- just one more.

2287
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:13,629
Um...

2288
01:58:15,954 --> 01:58:17,048
Great.

2289
01:58:17,073 --> 01:58:18,325
Oh. Oh, um...

2290
01:58:18,350 --> 01:58:19,979
May I have my I.D.?

2291
01:58:20,003 --> 01:58:21,027
You can.

2292
01:58:21,252 --> 01:58:23,338
All right. Let's go. Come on.

2293
01:58:23,363 --> 01:58:24,906
(in Russian): This may be
out of line

2294
01:58:24,931 --> 01:58:28,184
but I think it'd be appropriate
if Ivan apologizes.

2295
01:58:29,812 --> 01:58:33,273
Don't pay attention to him.
He is tired.

2296
01:58:33,398 --> 01:58:35,792
He also drank on
an empty stomach on the plane.

2297
01:58:35,818 --> 01:58:37,210
He helped us all night.

2298
01:58:37,236 --> 01:58:38,153
Listen here...

2299
01:58:39,279 --> 01:58:44,076
My son won't apologize
to anyone. Is that clear?

2300
01:58:44,201 --> 01:58:45,702
Of course.

2301
01:58:45,828 --> 01:58:48,371
(in English): 'Cause your son
is a fucking pussy.

2302
01:58:48,396 --> 01:58:49,648
What?

2303
01:58:49,673 --> 01:58:50,799
What? What?

2304
01:58:50,824 --> 01:58:52,885
What?
Did you not hear what I said?

2305
01:58:52,910 --> 01:58:55,020
I said it's 'cause your
son's a fucking pussy.

2306
01:58:55,045 --> 01:58:56,255
(in Russian): Let's go.

2307
01:58:56,713 --> 01:58:58,423
(in English): And you are
a disgusting hooker.

2308
01:59:00,968 --> 01:59:06,014
And your son hates you so much
he married one to piss you off.

2309
01:59:06,339 --> 01:59:07,641
That's enough.

2310
01:59:07,766 --> 01:59:08,809
Yeah.

2311
01:59:08,934 --> 01:59:10,853
Yeah, your family
is fucking trash.

2312
01:59:10,978 --> 01:59:12,437
Is this my scarf?

2313
01:59:13,163 --> 01:59:14,848
Yeah, you want...

2314
01:59:18,276 --> 01:59:20,904
There. Go get your
little scarf, sweetie.

2315
01:59:21,029 --> 01:59:22,573
That's-that's enough. Let's go.

2316
01:59:23,098 --> 01:59:24,732
Oh, I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

2317
01:59:24,757 --> 01:59:26,334
- Okay. Let's go.
- You know what?

2318
01:59:26,359 --> 01:59:27,719
(in Russian): What are you
laughing at?

2319
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:30,489
(in English): Why don't you take
your fucking coat, too?

2320
01:59:30,614 --> 01:59:32,415
That's enough. Let's go.

2321
01:59:37,570 --> 01:59:40,565
- Thank you so much, ma'am.
- You're very welcome. Um...

2322
01:59:45,228 --> 01:59:46,479
Goodbye, America.

2323
01:59:46,505 --> 01:59:47,714
Okay.

2324
01:59:47,739 --> 01:59:48,907
It's for you.

2325
01:59:48,932 --> 01:59:50,367
- Present.
- Oh, gosh.

2326
01:59:50,392 --> 01:59:51,743
No, I couldn't.
Thank you so...

2327
01:59:51,768 --> 01:59:53,145
Wait, is-is this real?

2328
01:59:57,190 --> 02:00:00,193
Take them to
McCarran Airport, domestic.

2329
02:00:00,319 --> 02:00:02,571
Igor is gonna take you back.

2330
02:00:02,896 --> 02:00:04,214
You can stay in
the house tonight,

2331
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:06,658
but you got to be
out of there in the morning.

2332
02:00:07,743 --> 02:00:09,745
And he'll pay you
when the bank opens.

2333
02:00:09,870 --> 02:00:10,954
Go.

2334
02:00:12,331 --> 02:00:13,957
And thank you.

2335
02:01:10,555 --> 02:01:12,766
<i>And it is starting to stick,
as well.</i>

2336
02:01:12,891 --> 02:01:15,477
<i>We'll show you a live look
at the roads in a little bit,</i>

2337
02:01:15,602 --> 02:01:17,938
<i>but officials that we've talked
with today say they are ready</i>

2338
02:01:18,063 --> 02:01:20,148
<i>for whatever Mother Nature
brings the next few days.</i>

2339
02:01:20,273 --> 02:01:24,486
<i>We got thousands of sanitation brothers and
sisters coming in doing overtime tonight.</i>

2340
02:01:24,611 --> 02:01:27,489
<i>If it accumulates, we'll be clearing
snow and ice from the street.</i>

2341
02:01:27,614 --> 02:01:29,741
<i>Every highway,
every bike lane in the city.</i>

2342
02:01:29,866 --> 02:01:31,952
<i>We'll be out starting
a midnight shift tonight.</i>

2343
02:01:32,277 --> 02:01:33,887
<i>On Long Island,
the salt trucks...</i>

2344
02:01:34,012 --> 02:01:36,507
Happy birthday to me.

2345
02:01:37,132 --> 02:01:38,400
Hmm?

2346
02:01:41,336 --> 02:01:43,522
Was today your birthday?

2347
02:01:43,547 --> 02:01:45,757
<i>January is
National Blood Donor Month...</i>

2348
02:01:46,082 --> 02:01:47,300
No.

2349
02:01:47,426 --> 02:01:49,136
<i>...is urging people to donate.</i>

2350
02:01:49,261 --> 02:01:51,471
<i>Advocates say the winter months
are a crucial time...</i>

2351
02:01:51,596 --> 02:01:53,665
Yesterday was my birthday.

2352
02:01:53,690 --> 02:01:55,626
<i>The senior vice
president and chief of staff</i>

2353
02:01:55,651 --> 02:01:57,169
<i>at New York Blood Center,
Clarissa Heyward...</i>

2354
02:01:57,394 --> 02:02:00,096
Yesterday was
your fucking birthday?

2355
02:02:02,190 --> 02:02:04,026
I was 30.

2356
02:02:05,902 --> 02:02:07,112
Mm.

2357
02:02:07,237 --> 02:02:09,239
Happy fucking birthday,
I guess.

2358
02:02:11,099 --> 02:02:12,751
Thank you.

2359
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:20,684
I like Anora.

2360
02:02:22,961 --> 02:02:25,797
I mean, I like Anora
more than Ani.

2361
02:02:28,291 --> 02:02:29,835
Okay.

2362
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:33,305
Says the fuck head named Igor.

2363
02:02:35,130 --> 02:02:36,975
Fucking Igor.

2364
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:39,070
Stupid name.

2365
02:02:39,895 --> 02:02:41,938
No, it's a good name.

2366
02:02:44,483 --> 02:02:47,319
It means "varrior."

2367
02:02:47,444 --> 02:02:49,321
Warrior.

2368
02:02:51,948 --> 02:02:53,950
Yeah?

2369
02:02:54,076 --> 02:02:57,279
Igor means "hunchback weirdo,"
you fucking piece of shit.

2370
02:02:57,304 --> 02:02:59,556
Can you shut the fuck up, please?

2371
02:03:03,134 --> 02:03:04,777
"Touche."

2372
02:03:07,089 --> 02:03:09,841
- "Touche"?
- "Touche."

2373
02:03:09,966 --> 02:03:12,553
Touché?

2374
02:03:13,178 --> 02:03:15,639
Touché, motherfucker?

2375
02:03:17,490 --> 02:03:19,743
You know, you really should
try learning English

2376
02:03:19,768 --> 02:03:21,269
before attempting French.

2377
02:03:22,354 --> 02:03:24,106
Okay. Touché.

2378
02:03:24,231 --> 02:03:25,857
Yeah.

2379
02:03:31,113 --> 02:03:33,281
And your name is better?

2380
02:03:33,906 --> 02:03:35,317
No.

2381
02:03:35,442 --> 02:03:37,694
But what does it mean?

2382
02:03:40,914 --> 02:03:43,333
In America, we don't care
about that kind of stuff.

2383
02:03:43,458 --> 02:03:45,335
We don't give meaning to names.

2384
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:48,255
It's... it's not a thing.

2385
02:04:18,577 --> 02:04:21,872
So, it means...

2386
02:04:23,573 --> 02:04:25,241
..."pomegranate fruit."

2387
02:04:25,467 --> 02:04:26,743
"Light."

2388
02:04:26,868 --> 02:04:29,496
Yeah, I'm not interested
in conversation, dude.

2389
02:04:31,548 --> 02:04:33,383
And "bright."

2390
02:04:44,853 --> 02:04:50,150
It's good that you're not
part of this family.

2391
02:04:55,088 --> 02:04:57,465
Did I ask for
your fucking opinion?

2392
02:05:01,194 --> 02:05:03,488
- No.
- No. Exactly.

2393
02:05:14,265 --> 02:05:16,601
I just tried to support you.

2394
02:05:19,054 --> 02:05:21,514
S-Support me?

2395
02:05:23,183 --> 02:05:25,143
Dude, you fucking assaulted me.

2396
02:05:25,268 --> 02:05:27,020
You... Fucking support?

2397
02:05:27,145 --> 02:05:29,397
- You... No, you...
- Oh. What?

2398
02:05:29,522 --> 02:05:30,941
No.

2399
02:05:31,066 --> 02:05:33,068
I didn't assault you.

2400
02:05:34,861 --> 02:05:38,156
You didn't...
You don't call that assault?

2401
02:05:38,281 --> 02:05:40,533
- No?
- No.

2402
02:05:40,659 --> 02:05:43,970
No, you're right. It's fucking
battery, as well as kidnapping

2403
02:05:43,995 --> 02:05:47,666
and fucking a million
other felonies, I'm sure.

2404
02:05:48,491 --> 02:05:51,419
- Fuck you, dude.
- (in Russian): But, I didn't assault you.

2405
02:05:52,612 --> 02:05:55,657
I was trying to calm you down,
so you didn't hurt yourself.

2406
02:05:55,682 --> 02:05:57,559
(in English): You fucking pinned
me to the ground.

2407
02:05:57,584 --> 02:05:59,335
You tied my fucking hands
behind my back.

2408
02:05:59,361 --> 02:06:01,029
You... you fucking gagged me.

2409
02:06:01,054 --> 02:06:02,472
Have you seen
the fucking bruises

2410
02:06:02,597 --> 02:06:05,433
on my legs and my fucking arms?

2411
02:06:05,558 --> 02:06:07,978
You fucking assaulted me,
you psychopath.

2412
02:06:09,104 --> 02:06:12,941
First, it's because
you have sensitive skin.

2413
02:06:13,366 --> 02:06:14,376
No, it's not.

2414
02:06:14,401 --> 02:06:16,361
It's because
you're fucking crazy.

2415
02:06:16,486 --> 02:06:19,948
And second,
because you're too crazy.

2416
02:06:21,825 --> 02:06:24,661
I mean "crazy, too."

2417
02:06:24,786 --> 02:06:28,540
But I can say
you're too crazy, too.

2418
02:06:30,041 --> 02:06:31,584
It's not funny, yeah.

2419
02:06:32,110 --> 02:06:33,820
Touché.

2420
02:06:34,679 --> 02:06:36,389
"Touche."

2421
02:06:39,259 --> 02:06:41,928
But, anyway,
you were not in danger

2422
02:06:42,053 --> 02:06:46,641
of injury or harm, right?

2423
02:06:55,041 --> 02:06:56,668
You know,
if Garnik wasn't there,

2424
02:06:56,693 --> 02:06:59,571
you'd have raped me,
guaranteed.

2425
02:07:02,206 --> 02:07:03,833
Raped?

2426
02:07:08,104 --> 02:07:09,480
No doubt.

2427
02:07:10,290 --> 02:07:13,317
Why... why would I
have raped you?

2428
02:07:16,504 --> 02:07:18,590
You have rape eyes.

2429
02:07:19,599 --> 02:07:21,193
Raped eyes?

2430
02:07:21,517 --> 02:07:23,111
Rape eyes.

2431
02:07:24,395 --> 02:07:25,480
You heard me.

2432
02:07:25,505 --> 02:07:28,049
You sick motherfucker
would've raped me.

2433
02:07:31,728 --> 02:07:35,190
Okay, uh, but I didn't want
to raped you.

2434
02:07:37,567 --> 02:07:39,444
Oh, yeah?

2435
02:07:40,712 --> 02:07:42,297
Why?

2436
02:07:44,866 --> 02:07:46,326
What?

2437
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:49,120
Why?

2438
02:07:49,245 --> 02:07:50,914
What "why?"

2439
02:07:52,123 --> 02:07:54,584
Why wouldn't you have raped me?

2440
02:07:57,921 --> 02:07:59,964
Because I'm...

2441
02:08:00,090 --> 02:08:02,133
not a rapist.

2442
02:08:05,095 --> 02:08:08,723
Nope, 'cause you're
a faggot-ass bitch.

2443
02:08:29,143 --> 02:08:30,345
Here.

2444
02:08:34,249 --> 02:08:35,792
(in Russian): Goodnight.

2445
02:10:18,102 --> 02:10:19,562
Hey.

2446
02:10:54,297 --> 02:10:55,798
Don't tell Toros.

2447
02:11:50,612 --> 02:11:53,197
This car is very you.

2448
02:11:57,427 --> 02:11:58,970
Do you like it?

2449
02:12:05,359 --> 02:12:06,902
No.

2450
02:12:17,672 --> 02:12:19,715
It's my grandmother's.
