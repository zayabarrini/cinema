The 1940s

18
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,307
You've lost again.

19
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,576
Not one lucky toss all night.

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,719
Chalk it up.

21
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,727
How much?

22
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,233
Chunsheng.

23
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,412
I've run up a pile of debts lately.

24
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,415
But my calligraphy's improving.

25
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,261
Long'er, you neglect your troupe.

26
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,700
But not my money.
They sound like a pack of mules.

27
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:29,203
They're too tired. Been at it all night.

28
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,910
Why don't you have a go?
Show them what it takes.

29
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,652
Business is good, Mr. Xie.

30
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,593
Come often. You're always welcome.

31
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,537
Old Man Heaven

32
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,152
Don't make it so late

33
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,355
Me and my lover

34
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,791
want more time

35
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,922
To frolic in our great big bed

36
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,672
Long'er, you're nearly there.

37
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,372
One more night like this...

38
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,782
you'll have him right where you want him.

39
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,679
Sure there's no mistake?

40
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,153
Look at the records.

41
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,790
Master Fugui is going home. You take him.

42
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,035
Take care.

43
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,898
Take care, Master.

44
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,925
Welcome home, sir.

45
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,192
Dad!

46
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,230
Degenerate! Another night gambling!

47
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:19,604
A dog's gotta eat shit! Little bastard!

48
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,076
If you don't stop...

49
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:26,416
we'll lose the little we have.

50
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,611
Aren't you capable of anything else?

51
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,981
Is gambling all you know?

52
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:36,061
Of all you could have learned, bastard!

53
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,526
Little bastards from big bastards grow.

54
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,098
I learned all I know from you.

55
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,930
How do you think we lost
most of what we had in the first place?

56
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:54,104
You're the one they call big bastard, Xu,
not me!

57
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,680
Will you cut it out?

58
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,021
-What'd he just say?
-Nothing. Eat.

59
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,516
Mother, when you finish,
send him to his room.

60
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,321
Grandpa's cursing you again.

61
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,758
He's just singing to himself.

62
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,899
You're up.

63
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,547
What's wrong?

64
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,947
Don't cry.

65
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,344
It's not good for the baby.

66
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,724
You said you wouldn't gamble
if I got pregnant.

67
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,292
Who was gambling? I went to watch.

68
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,963
What are you crying for?

69
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:49,061
If nothing else, can't you think of the baby?

70
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,702
Let me wipe your tears.

71
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,471
I'm not your father. I can't be fooled.

72
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,036
All right, do it yourself. But please don't cry.

73
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,308
Fugui...

74
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,450
I've said all there is to say.

75
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,585
Can't you listen just this once?
Quit gambling.

76
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,688
It's like kicking an opium habit, you know.

77
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,695
Too fast, and boing, you snap!
Could kill you.

78
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,397
Can't rush these things.

79
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:24,660
Fengxia's growing up. Another's on the way.

80
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,031
Please.

81
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,269
I'm not asking much.

82
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,041
Only to live a quiet life together.

83
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,276
Fugui, you choose. Gambling or family?

84
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,080
Tell me.

85
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,332
Your win, Master Fugui.

86
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,237
My luck's changed.

87
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,973
Write that down. Another round.

88
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,655
Master Fugui, your wife's here.

89
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,636
What are you doing here?

90
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,829
Well?

91
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,444
Mr. Long'er says
if you're busy he'll take a rain check.

92
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,149
No, have him wait. I'll be right there.

93
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,354
This is the last time, okay? I promise.

94
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,052
Go home, go.

95
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,165
It's settled.

96
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,363
Mr. Xie...

97
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,101
get a rickshaw to take my wife home. I'm....

98
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,966
Of course.

99
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,485
Master Fugui, you lost.

100
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,160
Let's roll!

101
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,561
Master Fugui.

102
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,314
Come, give Mrs. Xu a seat.

103
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,552
Fugui, for the last time.

104
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,490
Come home.

105
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,455
Why don't you go home?
There'll be other times.

106
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,026
Your wife is right here.

107
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,134
What's with you?
Can't take "no" for an answer?

108
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,931
You want to make me lose face? Go away!

109
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,903
Get out!

110
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,444
I've just....

111
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,810
Let's play!

112
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,948
Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,157
Get out of my sight!

114
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,420
Go!

115
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,290
Let's roll!

116
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,225
Well?

117
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:53,933
Master Fugui, you're out of the game.

118
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,265
You've lost everything.

119
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,007
What do you mean?

120
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:04,779
You bet your property.
It's equal to what you owe Long'er.

121
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,685
You don't have a roof tile to your name.

122
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,660
What is it?

123
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,197
Master Fugui must settle his account.

124
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,724
It's all in order, I'll be going.

125
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,955
Master Fugui, don't think badly of me...

126
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,526
for leaving you homeless.

127
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,164
But I sure like that mansion of yours.

128
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,804
See you there in a few days.

129
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,242
You can't just win and walk away.

130
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,907
The game's not over yet!

131
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,280
Master Fugui, I'm sorry...

132
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,343
but you've nothing left.
What would you wager?

133
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,384
If you're unhappy, talk to Mr. Xie.

134
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,221
This can't be happening!

135
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,521
What are you doing?

136
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,689
It's not over yet!

137
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,760
Sit down.

138
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:33,496
-Sit down!
-You planned all this, didn't you?

139
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,573
-Sit.
-Just one more round!

140
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,342
I am very sorry, but you've got nothing left.

141
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,351
What could you stake the bet on?
We don't accept empty bets.

142
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,918
I'll stake my life.

143
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,052
Don't talk like that.

144
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:59,791
Anyway, your life's worth little now.

145
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,690
Not that we'd accept it as ante.

146
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,100
We'll formalize the transfer in a few days...

147
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,866
and explain to your old man.

148
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,771
Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:13,972
We'll settle everything then.

150
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,505
Okay?

151
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,229
Your wife's been waiting for ages.

152
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,197
Fugui...

153
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,534
I just wanted to tell you...

154
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,934
I've realized...

155
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,910
you'll never change. I can't live like this.

156
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,177
I'm taking Fengxia with me.

157
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,237
If the baby is a boy...

158
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,067
I won't let him be like you.

159
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,755
Master Fugui, I'll take you.

160
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,434
-What are you doing?
-Master Fugui.

161
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,282
I have nothing left.

162
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:21,796
63, 73, 83....

163
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,977
Mr. Xu, any mistakes?

164
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:36,847
No, Fugui's signature is on each one.

165
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,526
Long'er, is our Xu family home...

166
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:46,223
enough to settle Fugui's debt?

167
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,730
Good.

168
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:55,401
A gambling debt's a debt,
and debts must be paid.

169
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,741
Everyone's here today.

170
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,210
So let's do what must be done.

171
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,078
The Xu family home...

172
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,678
goes to Long'er.

173
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,214
And the debt is hereby settled.

174
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,020
Both sides must sign.

175
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,310
I thought I'd live my final days here.

176
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,821
Fugui.

177
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,958
Turtle spawn! I'll kill him!

178
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:56,967
I'll cut him into pieces! I'll clobber him!

179
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,900
I'll never forgive you!

180
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,269
I'll never forgive you!

181
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,932
I want him dead!

182
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,978
Sir!

183
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:36,233
It's valuable. Don't scratch it. Take it slowly.

184
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,368
Careful, slowly. Don't move too fast!

185
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,503
Don't break anything!

186
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,079
Your mother's not well.
Go now, for her sake.

187
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:58,125
I'll look after her for a few days?

188
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,493
Until you're set up elsewhere.

189
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,929
Want me to help you?

190
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,052
Needles and threads for sale!

191
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,125
Granny!

192
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,623
Jiazhen's come home.

193
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,023
Jiazhen.

194
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,126
Come look at your son.

195
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,561
He looks like you.

196
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,333
No, like Jiazhen.

197
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,100
What's his name?

198
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,368
"Don't Gamble."

199
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,309
He'll never gamble.

200
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:29,909
Who chose that name?

201
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,339
Me.

202
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,083
Very good, very good.

203
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:37,087
I don't gamble now. Not even in my next life.

204
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:41,022
I know. Or I wouldn't have come back.

205
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,027
Is his name really "Don't Gamble"?

206
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:49,195
I was just teasing Fugui. It's Youqing.

207
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,266
Youqing, excellent.

208
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:57,734
Jiazhen, it's great to have you back.

209
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:06,345
I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,883
But I was too ashamed to see you.

211
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,253
Let's put the past behind us...

212
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,589
and live peacefully.

213
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,560
I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,964
It's crowded with all of us here.

215
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:26,365
I'll tidy up tomorrow. We'll be fine.

216
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,039
Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,905
Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

218
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:37,145
Dad didn't give me much money...

219
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,850
but she needs a doctor.

220
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,717
We'll work something out.

221
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,215
I'll borrow money to set up a shop.

222
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,990
Life won't be easy.

223
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,154
Don't say that.

224
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,089
All I ask is a quiet life together.

225
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,534
A rare visitor indeed.

226
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,671
Master Fugui! It's been a year at least.

227
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,542
Just call me Fugui.

228
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,345
This old home of yours is great.

229
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,945
Warm in winter, cool in summer.

230
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,044
Great at any price.

231
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,584
I've given up the puppet troupe.

232
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,092
Have a seat.

233
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:28,564
I don't gamble anymore.
Don't want to end up like you.

234
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,534
"Don't Gamble" is my son's name.

235
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,367
You mocking me?

236
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,963
No, his real name's Youqing.

237
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,001
Jiazhen came back with him.

238
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,443
We almost called him "Don't Gamble."

239
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,451
I'd like to borrow money to set up a shop.

240
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,287
I'm not one to lend money.

241
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:02,722
I'll lend you something else. More practical.

242
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,502
I never had to beg
when I ran the puppet troupe.

243
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,769
Earn your money yourself.

244
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,106
Put together a troupe.

245
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,480
They are fabulous.

246
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,824
My heart is full of sorrow

247
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:45,910
It's that hateful bandit, Jiang

248
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:08,199
I'm lucky to be alive

249
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:38,245
Me and my lover want more time

250
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:42,917
To frolic on our great big bed

251
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,457
Come out!

252
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,863
Come on! Get a move on!

253
00:28:56,167 --> 00:29:00,160
1949: Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Army
is losing the civil war.

254
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:04,106
The Communists under Mao Zedong
are poised to take over China.

255
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,242
So we're fighting the Communists.

256
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,344
Might never go home again.

257
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,799
What are you looking at?

258
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,465
Thinking of escaping?

259
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,702
The Nationalists will shoot you.

260
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,040
Besides...

261
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:42,438
troops for both sides are everywhere.

262
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,147
If you don't fight the Reds,
you fight the KMT.

263
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:48,743
But who will look after my wife,
my kids, my old mother?

264
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,984
Forget it. Try to save your own skin.

265
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:03,832
As for me...

266
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,173
if I weren't looking for my brother,
I wouldn't be wearing this uniform.

267
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:39,434
Chunsheng, you really are mad.

268
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,199
I'd die happy if I could drive.

269
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,741
As for me...

270
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:50,140
I want to live. There's nothing like family.

271
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:54,844
One, two, three. One, two, three.

272
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,662
This case is in the way!

273
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,627
Whose is it? Get rid of it!

274
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:11,999
Sir, it's mine.
I've got my things in it. Let me keep it.

275
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,197
Get it out of my sight then.

276
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:21,306
It's just a bunch of puppets.
Get rid of them! This is war!

277
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,707
They're not mine. It's how I make my living.

278
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,613
What a bloodbath.

279
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,982
What's that sound?

280
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,122
The wounded.

281
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,518
They're freezing.

282
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,987
No one's looking after them?

283
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,554
No one's left.

284
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,693
Must be tens of thousands
of us trapped here.

285
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,338
Way to go, Chunsheng!

286
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,744
Take this.

287
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:38,879
-Where'd you get them?
-Off the corpses.

288
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:41,858
Which corpses?

289
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:44,791
The wounded who froze to death.

290
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,997
Put it on. We must survive.

291
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,662
Lao Quan, have a drink.

292
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:58,939
It really is booze!

293
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,308
Was it from some dead officer?

294
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,880
Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,359
You've looked after us.

296
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,661
We must help each other.

297
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,397
Besides, we're from the same town.

298
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,725
Lao Quan, the place is deserted.

299
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,693
I'm still dizzy from drinking!

300
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,959
What happened? No one's left?

301
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,164
They've all run off.

302
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,705
How could that be?

303
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,536
The Reds must be on the attack.

304
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,700
What?

305
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,911
-Shouldn't we run, too?
-Where to?

306
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,173
Home!

307
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,342
Home?

308
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,148
Wait right here.

309
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,386
Run now...

310
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,953
and you'll be shot.

311
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,129
Better to wait and become a POW.

312
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:29,594
The Reds send POWs home.

313
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,030
So, no running?

314
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,297
That's right.

315
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,965
You want to go home, don't run.

316
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,740
They won't shoot us?

317
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,972
Not as long as you've got your hands up.

318
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,103
How?

319
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:49,518
This will do the trick?

320
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,084
Don't reach for your waist!

321
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,149
Do that and you're dead.

322
00:34:56,894 --> 00:35:01,228
The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

323
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,466
Just put those hands up.

324
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:22,514
-The attack hasn't started.
-Let's put them down.

325
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,637
Chunsheng!

326
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:36,418
Dying like this,
their families won't even know.

327
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,290
Fugui...

328
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,463
we've got to make it back alive.

329
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,299
And live a good life.

330
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,846
Lao Quan! They're shooting!

331
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:08,425
Where did you find this coat?

332
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:13,355
-On one of the wounded.
-It's a killing field.

333
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:17,393
The coat's from my brother's unit.

334
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,932
-What are you doing?
-They're shooting!

335
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,308
What's your brother look like?

336
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,849
Just like me.

337
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,597
Lao Quan!

338
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,991
The enemy's secret weapon

339
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,702
wounded me

340
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:50,170
I gather my troops

341
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:03,783
and we run for our lives

342
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,223
Fengxia!

343
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,767
It's your daddy.

344
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,017
What are you doing?

345
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,343
Where's mommy?

346
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,091
I'm home.

347
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,122
Home.

348
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,574
Mother died without knowing where I was.

349
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,581
The day...

350
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:52,081
we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,759
Suppose I was singing for her, too.

352
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,491
She never shut her eyes...

353
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:08,427
kept them fixed on the door,
so sure you'd be back.

354
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:12,142
You should have written.

355
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,834
Written?

356
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:18,575
I never thought I'd make it back alive.

357
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,748
I thought of you...

358
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,681
all the time and worried...

359
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:29,392
how you were getting by.

360
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,885
The new government
paid for mother's burial...

361
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,231
and gave me this job, delivering water.

362
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,063
I'm up before dawn.

363
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,500
Everyone wants water.

364
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,096
The more I deliver, the more I earn.

365
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:47,368
It's been hard on the kids.

366
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,772
They never get...

367
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,445
a good night's sleep.

368
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,644
How come Fengxia can't talk?

369
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,945
She was fine when I left.

370
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,250
She can't even say "Daddy."

371
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:04,026
In fact, she was lucky.

372
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,594
For a week, she ran a high fever.

373
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:11,833
No one thought she'd pull through.

374
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:14,429
When the fever came down...

375
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,635
she'd lost her voice.

376
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,033
You're here.

377
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:48,571
Fugui's back.

378
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:52,000
This is our town leader, Mr. Niu.

379
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,972
So you're our leading cadre.

380
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:58,781
-I heard you got back this morning.
-I'm back.

381
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:01,779
I have come to see if you need anything.

382
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,646
Look at this.

383
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,691
He has served in the Liberation Army?

384
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,621
You participated in the revolution.

385
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,028
I just dragged a cannon and sang opera.

386
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:17,362
That's taking part.

387
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:23,869
You were with Chunsheng.
Why isn't he back?

388
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:27,138
He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

389
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,706
We won't see him for a while.

390
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:32,313
Fugui, you're back just in time...

391
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:34,680
to attend Long'er's public trial.

392
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:38,152
Come along and get an education.

393
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,786
What did Long'er do?

394
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:47,025
Because of the family home,
he's been sentenced a landlord.

395
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,600
But it's not just that.

396
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:55,397
The government wanted part of the house.

397
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,273
He refused, beat up a cadre...

398
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,173
and then set fire to the place.

399
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:04,342
Classic counterrevolutionary sabotage.

400
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:09,517
He burnt it?

401
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,486
It burnt for days.

402
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,752
Your timber was first class!

403
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:22,531
That wasn't ours.
It was counterrevolutionary timber.

404
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,728
Counterrevolutionary timber.

405
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,001
Of course. You're you, he's him.

406
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:34,373
Execute the revolutionary despot, Long'er!

407
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:39,373
To the execution ground!

408
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,677
We will crush the counterrevolution!

409
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,688
Crush the counterrevolution!

410
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,384
Down with the counterrevolutionaries!

411
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,662
Long live the Communist Party!

412
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,632
Long live the People's Government!

413
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:07,409
Long live Chairman Mao!
Down with the counterrevolutionaries!

414
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,904
Build a new China!

415
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,075
What's wrong?

416
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:15,911
Why are your pants wet?

417
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,243
Five bullets. Five.

418
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,273
They shot him.

419
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,084
They shot Long'er?

420
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,417
Pumped five bullets into him.

421
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:28,886
He is dead.

422
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:31,018
If I hadn't lost my home to him...

423
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:32,891
that'd have been me.

424
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,793
What class do we belong to?

425
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,229
Landlords?

426
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:45,400
Surely not. We lost that status to Long'er.
So, what are we?

427
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,301
Not landlords.

428
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:50,640
Ordinary townspeople.

429
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,309
Sounds okay to me.
And I took part in the revolution.

430
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:08,596
-What are you looking for?
-That certificate.

431
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:11,691
-ln the wash?
-No, here it is.

432
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,637
Better dry it out fast.

433
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,271
Have to keep it safe.

434
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:24,109
Are you sure we're just townsfolk?

435
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:26,377
Of course.

436
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,543
Poor townspeople.

437
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:31,978
It's good to be poor. Nothing like it.

438
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,152
Get a frame for it tomorrow.

439
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,621
I'll hang it on the wall.

440
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,294
Good idea!

441
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:59,971
The 1950s

442
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:04,417
1958: Mao Zedong launches
the "Great Leap Forward."

443
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:08,288
Steel production is now targeted
at 10.7 million tonnes per year.

444
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:11,885
Every household donates its iron utensils.

445
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:31,580
Take a break.

446
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,212
Tired?

447
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,850
Fugui!

448
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,561
Our family's turn to donate iron.

449
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,629
It's ready.

450
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,989
It's all here?

451
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:53,333
Keep these.

452
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:56,194
To deliver water to the steelworks.

453
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,002
Everyone will be thirsty.

454
00:52:58,074 --> 00:52:59,701
We'll take these.

455
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:06,282
If you take all our pots away,
how will we cook?

456
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:10,546
We're racing towards Communism,
and you worry about food?

457
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,579
We are setting up communal kitchens.

458
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:15,858
When you're hungry...

459
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,690
just come to the canteen.

460
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,855
There'll be meat, fish.

461
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:25,330
Nothing else to contribute?

462
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:27,493
Yes, there is!

463
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:34,268
But that's wood.

464
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,942
There's metal on it.

465
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,746
And here are pins.

466
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,644
It can't be worth much.

467
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:49,249
We are less politically aware than your son.

468
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,652
It's enough for two bullets.

469
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:55,427
We are just two bullets short
of liberating Taiwan.

470
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,600
So let's get that metal.

471
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:12,145
The workers deserve entertaining,
don't they?

472
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:15,476
You know, I sang for the Liberation Army...

473
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:18,083
and after that...

474
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:21,282
they captured two mountains a day.

475
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,753
I see your point.

476
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,096
All I've seen at the worksites
are student marching bands.

477
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,857
We'll spur them on with puppet shows.

478
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,527
You can leave those.

479
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,400
We won't touch them.

480
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,069
We're off to the next house.

481
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,905
We are not going to liberate Taiwan?

482
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:49,848
Sure we are. We'll definitely liberate Taiwan.

483
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:55,112
Take that!

484
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,236
-Enough?
-No!

485
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,104
Enough?

486
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:54,266
Still not enough? Okay, I'll fill it right up.

487
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:57,842
Big ambition for a little kid.

488
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:01,117
It's more than enough.

489
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,148
So gobble away. Help yourself to sauces.

490
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,584
Youqing, I'll help you stir that up.

491
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,393
What a big appetite!

492
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,901
And so much chili sauce!

493
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,474
That's a big bowl, Youqing.

494
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,980
Give it to us if you can't finish.

495
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:07,205
What the hell are you doing?

496
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:08,978
How could you?

497
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:14,581
Can't you control this child?

498
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:17,424
What did you think you were doing?

499
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,961
What is this?

500
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:22,894
Look at all the chili sauce.
Let me see your eyes.

501
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:26,995
This is too much.

502
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:31,464
-Trying to kill him, or what?
-They're just kids.

503
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:34,032
Kids? Where did he learn that from?

504
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:38,942
This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

505
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,445
We don't know what's going on.

506
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:44,319
Do you expect me to believe that?

507
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:47,752
It's sabotage.
Sabotage to the communal kitchen.

508
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:51,858
And sabotage of the Great Leap Forward!

509
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,130
That kid could not dream that up.

510
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:00,666
Youqing! Look what you've done!

511
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,268
Apologize. Say you were wrong.

512
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:07,067
Now!

513
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,108
I'm talking to you.

514
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:14,544
-Are you going?
-No.

515
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,842
-Are you going or not?
-No!

516
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,618
-I'm telling you to go!
-No!

517
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:22,850
You won't go?

518
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,353
Don't hit him!

519
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:33,892
Leave him alone! I'll kill him!

520
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:34,902
Enough!

521
00:59:41,076 --> 00:59:42,566
How could you?

522
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:45,879
Said he was a saboteur. I had to.

523
00:59:46,348 --> 00:59:49,044
That guy's word is law? The government?

524
00:59:49,785 --> 00:59:51,810
I tried to stop you.

525
00:59:52,821 --> 00:59:55,119
Why wouldn't he just apologize?

526
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,150
I hit him for not obeying.

527
00:59:58,227 --> 00:59:59,592
That's no excuse.

528
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:01,719
You spoil him.

529
01:00:02,264 --> 01:00:03,288
How so?

530
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,701
Can't you see I'm doing this for our family?

531
01:00:07,302 --> 01:00:08,667
Don't you understand?

532
01:00:08,737 --> 01:00:11,069
If you indulge him, we'll all go to ruin.

533
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,472
I'll hit him again if I have to.

534
01:00:23,185 --> 01:00:25,676
Sit then. Right in front of me!

535
01:00:27,623 --> 01:00:30,057
Isn't he your own flesh and blood?

536
01:00:30,192 --> 01:00:33,184
You, looking after us! After all these years.

537
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,954
What do you know?

538
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:40,727
Kids had been bullying Fengxia.
He was defending her.

539
01:00:43,572 --> 01:00:47,440
Do you think I'd let this family go to ruin?

540
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,439
I've stuck with you through good and bad.

541
01:00:51,513 --> 01:00:53,413
Have I ever complained?

542
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:38,353
Poor Fengxia.
Can't even talk back to bullies.

543
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:43,992
Youqing adores her. And you'd hit him.

544
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,265
Daddy will make it better.

545
01:01:57,513 --> 01:01:59,481
Youqing, after dinner...

546
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:02,177
come see the show.

547
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:05,277
Youqing's not going to any stupid show.

548
01:02:11,493 --> 01:02:16,487
He uses the secret mirror

549
01:02:19,968 --> 01:02:24,996
and blinds all who look within

550
01:02:39,788 --> 01:02:44,782
I yell there's no time to waste

551
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:15,714
Far away, we flee with haste
