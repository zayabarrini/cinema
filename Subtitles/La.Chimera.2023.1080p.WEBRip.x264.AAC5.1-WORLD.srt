3
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:31,842
Eh?

4
00:01:58,217 --> 00:02:01,117
Have you noticed
the sun is following us?

5
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:06,483
It's following us.

6
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:51,091
Good morning, tickets please.

7
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:54,299
Sir?

8
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,049
Sir?

9
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
Were you dreaming?

10
00:03:00,717 --> 00:03:04,007
Sorry, you'll never know
how it ends now.

11
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:06,841
May I see your ticket, please?

12
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:20,217
What a strange ticket...

13
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:31,970
Ask him...

14
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,966
Excuse me. May I...

15
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:36,397
Where are you from?

16
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,438
Somewhere far away?

17
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:42,694
- Yes, sort of.
- And where's that?

18
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,091
It doesn't matter.

19
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,591
You're local.

20
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,424
Yes.

21
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:55,387
- Is it so obvious?
- Yes... I can tell.

22
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:58,091
Of course! You're such a bumpkin!

23
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,757
You look like...

24
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,757
like some paintings...

25
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:10,041
ancient ones...

26
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,591
Your profile.

27
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:15,049
- Mine?
- Yes.

28
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,049
Yes, perhaps...

29
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,007
maybe you've seen them.

30
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:22,213
A profile like yours.

31
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,115
A big nose?

32
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:29,427
Oh no, just the opposite.

33
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:31,462
It's nice... it's nice.

34
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:33,522
So you're a scientist?

35
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:35,216
No, no, I'm...

36
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,346
Jeez, it really stinks in here!

37
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:43,419
This fine gentleman
doesn't like water?

38
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,887
When did you last
change your socks, mate?

39
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:49,428
But it's your lucky day,
look at this.

40
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:52,937
Because you need some new socks
You really stink!

41
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,262
Buy some perfume
to soothe your delicate nostrils.

42
00:04:56,342 --> 00:04:59,887
You tell him. Such a charming man,
but he stinks.

43
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,753
How can you pretty girls
put up with this stench?

44
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,333
- He's smoking to hide the smell.
- That's enough.

45
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:09,174
Not even jail smelled this bad.

46
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:11,382
Enough! What the fuck!

47
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:26,262
Take it easy.

48
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:28,470
Be careful, this guy's dangerous.

49
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,907
You know what? I'll gift
you some socks... Here.

50
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:33,717
Skinflint.

51
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:38,970
There's a six-foot criminal
on the train, folks!

52
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,882
Come on, sock him in the face...

53
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,757
Buy my socks!

54
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,341
Socks, perfumes, aftershave!

55
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,220
- What can you see?
- People.

56
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,924
Can I have a look?

57
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,091
THE CHIMERA

58
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:32,091
Arthur!

59
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,174
Arthur!

60
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:37,966
Come on, jump in.

61
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:43,137
- What are you doing here?
- Spartaco told me you were coming.

62
00:07:43,217 --> 00:07:47,003
He is the one who paid the lawyer
to get you released!

63
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,050
Eh?

64
00:07:51,258 --> 00:07:54,424
- I'll. pay it all back.
- There's no need.

65
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:58,211
- He just wants you to go and say hi.
- Say hi?

66
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:00,174
Fuck that!

67
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:02,174
Come on, Arthur!

68
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,501
Don't be like that!

69
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:06,632
Don't be stupid!

70
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:11,049
Please wait, listen...

71
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,653
We're sorry about that day,
I mean that night.

72
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:17,948
We honestly didn't notice
you'd fallen behind.

73
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:21,036
Don't waste your saliva.

74
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:27,062
"Don't waste your saliva"?
I taught you that expression.

75
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,757
Take me home.

76
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,762
I said home, not here!
I don't want to see anyone.

77
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:23,842
No one.

78
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:28,294
Just five minutes...
A toast with your friends!

79
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:34,674
Here they are.

80
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,174
Here he is at last!

81
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:38,508
Well then?

82
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,507
Short hair, so pale. What happened?

83
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,882
I'll take Arthur home,

84
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:47,553
he can settle in,
then he'll come back and celebrate.

85
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:50,053
Not even a toast after all this time?

86
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,845
- No, thanks.
- Then we'll come with you.

87
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,674
Mario, fetch a bottle.

88
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:57,882
What the fuck!

89
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,216
I did try...

90
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:41,882
Here, chicky chicky...

91
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:45,175
Sorry.

92
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:47,174
- Arthur?
- Yes.

93
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:50,438
It is you, isn't it?

94
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:53,549
Yes, I'm looking for signora Flora.

95
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:57,481
I know.
You're all she ever talks about.

96
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:59,882
Arthur this, Arthur that...

97
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:02,632
- Can I see her?
- Yes.

98
00:13:03,342 --> 00:13:04,882
I reckon so.

99
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:06,883
Right now?

100
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,507
Yes, of course.

101
00:13:08,925 --> 00:13:10,605
I'll come with you.

102
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:29,541
Ma'am.

103
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:33,887
Have you been smoking? I told you
not to! It spoils your voice!

104
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:35,466
He's here.

105
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:38,091
At last!

106
00:13:39,258 --> 00:13:41,091
My friend.

107
00:13:42,217 --> 00:13:45,049
My dear friend, my only friend.

108
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:46,853
Take me in there.

109
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:48,688
What a catastrophe!

110
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:54,774
This leg works, I can move this one.

111
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:58,549
But not this one,
hence the wheelchair.

112
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:00,194
It's comfortable.

113
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,882
Wheelchairs are a great invention.

114
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:07,374
You see? I told you he'd come back.
Woman of little faith.

115
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:10,307
This is Beniamina's boyfriend.

116
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,521
Go and make some coffee, go on.

117
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,682
Beniamina...

118
00:14:24,683 --> 00:14:26,891
Don't lose hope.

119
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,774
Yes, but...

120
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:37,586
But you always find everything...

121
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:39,016
Yes, of course.

122
00:14:39,558 --> 00:14:41,141
That was quick!

123
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,088
It's cold!

124
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:46,241
No, make some fresh coffee.

125
00:14:46,642 --> 00:14:48,432
It's fine. Thanks.

126
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,349
He's so polite. You're so sweet.

127
00:15:00,808 --> 00:15:03,809
What are you doing?
Don't just stand there!

128
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:07,653
- What must I do?
- Warm up your voice!

129
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:10,570
No, bring some wood in,
physical exercise helps.

130
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:15,079
You don't sing with your brain,
you sing with your body. Go on!

131
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,670
Nosy Parker.

132
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:38,633
Tone deaf.
She's completely tone deaf.

133
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,224
Poor thing...

134
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:14,587
- Hi, Sista, how are things?
- Fine.

135
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:16,762
- Hi, Grandma.
- My little flower.

136
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,457
- Good morning, Mum.
- Look who's here!

137
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:22,002
- Grandma.
- Darling, how are you?

138
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:25,933
- Mum, how are you?
- Just great. Look who's here!

139
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,395
- Are you glad he's back, Mum?
- Of course. Here he is!

140
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:30,932
Arthur's back.

141
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:33,770
Arthur, your eyes are glassy.

142
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,530
Don't you feel well?

143
00:16:35,683 --> 00:16:37,420
You're dressed too lightly.

144
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,619
He's bound to fall sick like that.

145
00:16:39,725 --> 00:16:41,395
Have you got any clothes?

146
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:43,327
Let's look in Dad's room.

147
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:45,812
Trousers, sweaters.
I'll put some together.

148
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:48,062
He can't wear a dead man's clothes.

149
00:16:48,142 --> 00:16:50,809
Do you remember... What's it called?

150
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:55,395
- The shearling jacket!
- Yes, perfect, it's nice and warm.

151
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:56,557
Okay.

152
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:01,117
Thank you, Italia.

153
00:17:01,558 --> 00:17:02,853
Thank you, my dear.

154
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:04,349
Eat up.

155
00:17:07,017 --> 00:17:09,724
Who's this? The new student?

156
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:15,253
Hasn't he had lunch yet?

157
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,520
- Call that lunch?
- Expect her to make roast beef?

158
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,174
- That's overcooked and bland.
- No! It looks delicious!

159
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:23,812
- Is it good?
- Yes.

160
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:27,107
Italia is a fine cook
with a talent for music.

161
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:29,978
Music? The music's
about to change though.

162
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:31,984
- Will you tell him?
- Yes.

163
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:35,682
Arthur, we've found you a job.

164
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:37,557
A proper job.

165
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,557
At a builders' warehouse.

166
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:43,952
No more living on Mum's shoulders.

167
00:17:44,892 --> 00:17:47,411
You can start work as of tomorrow.

168
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,641
No, thanks.

169
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:55,062
You're stuck up, you know that?

170
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:58,642
And to think Beniamina loved you,
how could she...

171
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:01,182
She still loves him!

172
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:04,708
That's enough, Nella, sit down!
Sit down!

173
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,318
- Are you okay, Mum?
- Yes.

174
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:25,380
Italia, can you take his plate away,
please?

175
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,100
Bring Arthur a light
for his cigarette. Thank you.

176
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:32,770
You let him smoke in the house?

177
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,517
Because he's a man. No one else can.

178
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,545
You never allowed us to.

179
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:41,062
- I'll get him some clothes.
- Your student's very obedient.

180
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:45,016
She's a servant
disguised as a student.

181
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,687
- We all know that.
- Of course we do.

182
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:51,062
Mum's clever at finding maids without
having to pay. She's manipulative.

183
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:54,849
Okay, let's end it here.
We'll never agree.

184
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,557
Every time we come here
we start arguing.

185
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,599
That's enough! Enough!

186
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,145
- What's up?
- Did you hear that?

187
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:07,141
- What?
- I can hear a baby crying.

188
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:11,395
- It's a little lamb.
- No, it's not...

189
00:19:11,475 --> 00:19:14,364
- It's a baby crying.
- I can't hear it!

190
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,878
What are you doing here?

191
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:03,124
Signora Flora told me to bring you
these things.

192
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:07,099
Here.

193
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:15,052
For the fever.

194
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:16,947
Take your temperature.

195
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:19,488
What are you doing?

196
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:22,307
Are you crazy? You'll break it.

197
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:24,658
You'll break it...

198
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:35,382
You've done a good job here.

199
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:40,349
Nice.

200
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:44,641
What are all these objects?

201
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,557
Just old stuff.

202
00:21:56,267 --> 00:21:57,267
Eh?

203
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:02,224
Things many "hyes" have seen.

204
00:22:04,142 --> 00:22:05,474
Eyes.

205
00:22:06,142 --> 00:22:07,307
Eyes.

206
00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:10,349
Not hyes, eyes.

207
00:22:10,642 --> 00:22:11,642
Thanks.

208
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:15,297
can give you a crash course
in Italian if you want.

209
00:22:15,475 --> 00:22:16,475
You?

210
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:18,267
Sure!

211
00:22:21,183 --> 00:22:23,405
It's a nice hiding place here.

212
00:22:24,683 --> 00:22:27,127
All those plants, al the trees...

213
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:31,690
There were lots of trees
where I was born too.

214
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:35,236
Andiroba trees...

215
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:37,367
Jacaranda trees...

216
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,136
It was the only thing
I liked about that place.

217
00:22:51,225 --> 00:22:52,905
Why are you laughing?

218
00:22:53,808 --> 00:22:56,266
Look at that. Isn't it strange?

219
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:00,916
It looks like a person
planted head down in the ground.

220
00:23:02,808 --> 00:23:05,623
Yes, there...
where the branches split.

221
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:07,182
See?

222
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:08,475
No.

223
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:12,492
This one's better.

224
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:16,674
Maybe you can see it better
from here.

225
00:23:21,142 --> 00:23:22,266
No, no, no!

226
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:26,599
What's this?

227
00:23:28,517 --> 00:23:29,766
Fuck!

228
00:23:33,142 --> 00:23:34,142
Arthur?

229
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:32,266
Your things are in here.

230
00:24:32,892 --> 00:24:34,492
Your beloved pots.

231
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:38,523
Did you think we'd stolen them.
from under your tree?

232
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:40,716
Here you are. It's all here.

233
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:02,203
We couldn't leave them

234
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:05,178
with the police rummaging around
after you got arrested.

235
00:25:05,258 --> 00:25:07,728
They wanted to nail you
and increase your sentence.

236
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:10,437
And instead of thanking us
you barge in here?

237
00:25:10,517 --> 00:25:13,946
- What will you do with them?
- I don't know, eh?

238
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:19,791
Leave it to me. I'll take them
to Spartaco to pay off my debt.

239
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:23,266
Take them to Spartaco?
He'd only laugh at you.

240
00:25:24,892 --> 00:25:28,145
Instead of taking Spartaco
these cheap pieces...

241
00:25:28,225 --> 00:25:31,368
why don't we find something
to put with them?

242
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,957
- Now we're back together again...
- No, thanks!

243
00:25:36,392 --> 00:25:38,503
- That's my uncle.
- What do you want?

244
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,316
- The hoe.
- Hurry up!

245
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,861
Not dead yet, eh?

246
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:43,988
Don't be a nuisance!

247
00:25:44,225 --> 00:25:45,647
Get out of here.

248
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,766
Move it!

249
00:25:57,683 --> 00:26:01,645
Arthur, wanna end up like him?
Soft in the head from the toil.

250
00:26:01,725 --> 00:26:04,540
Bent over by life
and with a limp dick.

251
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:09,099
Come on... don't try and fool us.

252
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:15,475
I know you can't rest knowing
those things are still down there.

253
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:17,577
There's a lot down there.

254
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:18,974
For sure!

255
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,691
Arthur...

256
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:46,149
The witches are coming!

257
00:28:01,483 --> 00:28:02,816
Happy Epiphany!

258
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:04,357
He's stone drunk.

259
00:29:05,317 --> 00:29:07,278
Wait, we'll take it off here

260
00:29:07,358 --> 00:29:09,607
and put it on here!

261
00:29:09,942 --> 00:29:12,524
You look so beautiful!

262
00:29:17,275 --> 00:29:18,275
Excuse me.

263
00:29:19,483 --> 00:29:21,083
Excuse me, please.

264
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,691
Excuse me, can I take a photo?

265
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:28,692
- Can I take your photo?
- A photo...

266
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,982
Just one.

267
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:36,566
Don't hide!

268
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,774
Just one photo!

269
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:40,191
Okay.

270
00:29:41,108 --> 00:29:42,108
No!

271
00:29:42,358 --> 00:29:43,691
Please!

272
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:45,663
- Have we met?
- No.

273
00:29:46,858 --> 00:29:49,525
But people have told me about you...

274
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:52,066
and him. the Englishman.

275
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:53,399
Me?

276
00:29:54,108 --> 00:29:55,788
I'm Spartaco's friend.

277
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,641
- Ah, you're Spartaco's friend?
- Yes.

278
00:29:59,317 --> 00:30:01,836
- Your friend is very rude.
- No...

279
00:30:02,858 --> 00:30:04,670
He's like that when he drinks.

280
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,024
- He's an oaf.
- You say that 'cos you're in love.

281
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,039
What if I were?
Would you recommend him?

282
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:14,862
We would recommend him,
but he doesn't look at girls anymore,

283
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:17,941
he only thinks of the one who's gone.

284
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:22,066
You see?

285
00:30:22,692 --> 00:30:24,482
Hold it there!

286
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:27,066
Come on!

287
00:31:37,692 --> 00:31:39,191
Mister...

288
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:40,775
Mister...

289
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,701
come with me, I have a gig for you.

290
00:31:45,442 --> 00:31:47,886
I want to show you something big.

291
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:50,042
Filled with stuff.

292
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,442
But then we'll go halves. All right?

293
00:32:14,442 --> 00:32:15,482
Mario?

294
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:19,461
You should see what a perfectly
round hole she left.

295
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:25,293
My granddad said, "Before you marry
a woman, take her to pee on the sand.

296
00:32:25,483 --> 00:32:29,570
If the hole she leaves is nice
and round and deep, marry her!

297
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,243
But if she drips here and there..."

298
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,862
That's why you never married.

299
00:32:34,942 --> 00:32:37,528
But maybe she's the right girl, eh?

300
00:32:37,608 --> 00:32:39,028
Have you seen her?

301
00:32:39,108 --> 00:32:42,982
That woman is an ornament of nature.

302
00:32:43,692 --> 00:32:44,903
If you say so.

303
00:32:44,983 --> 00:32:47,502
Melodie, do you know what you are?

304
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:49,566
An ornament of nature.

305
00:32:49,858 --> 00:32:51,232
Thanks, Pirro.

306
00:32:51,525 --> 00:32:53,377
Help me. How do I get in?

307
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,237
Did she have to come?

308
00:32:55,317 --> 00:32:58,389
Maybe we can sell her something,
she's rich.

309
00:32:59,608 --> 00:33:01,030
Careful does it.

310
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:03,982
There you are. Careful.

311
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,530
Now spin around.

312
00:33:08,192 --> 00:33:12,121
We'll show you things
even archaeologists would die for!

313
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,857
I find the Etruscans so fascinating,
so "bohemian",

314
00:33:17,108 --> 00:33:19,695
so distant from the myth
of the Roman world.

315
00:33:19,775 --> 00:33:20,857
Pirro!

316
00:33:21,108 --> 00:33:22,732
As my aunt says...

317
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:25,557
If the Etruscans had still been here

318
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:28,452
wouldn't be all this machismo in Italy

319
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:33,649
Did you know the women
were in charge in Etruscan times?

320
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:37,719
Well done, excellent observation!

321
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,080
- Here I am.
- At last.

322
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:41,607
I'm late.

323
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,641
- We were waiting for you.
- Let's go.

324
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:47,066
- Come on.
- Mister, let's go.

325
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:51,192
- Where is it?
- Over there.

326
00:33:51,525 --> 00:33:53,205
- Over there?
- Yes.

327
00:33:53,442 --> 00:33:55,899
It's under here. A treasure!

328
00:33:57,108 --> 00:33:58,788
It's full of stuff!

329
00:33:59,775 --> 00:34:02,066
But remember what we agreed.

330
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,024
No tricks now.

331
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:08,737
There's nothing here, Katir.

332
00:34:08,817 --> 00:34:10,820
There are no signs of a tomb.

333
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,778
- It's a hole.
- You were wrong.

334
00:34:12,858 --> 00:34:14,987
- It was probably a cattleshed.
- What?

335
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:17,862
My ancestors found
a load of stuff around here!

336
00:34:17,942 --> 00:34:20,857
Vases, a spear! Even a statue!

337
00:34:21,108 --> 00:34:23,237
Where are all these things now?

338
00:34:23,317 --> 00:34:26,362
They dumped them, they got scared.
What fools!

339
00:34:26,442 --> 00:34:29,871
But if the expert wants
to check the place out...

340
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:31,733
Mister...

341
00:34:35,525 --> 00:34:36,607
Okay.

342
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:40,570
Won't you offer the maestro a drink?
Before he gets to work?

343
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,983
You've got some

344
00:34:42,275 --> 00:34:44,778
You've got some. Of course you do...

345
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:46,191
There you are.

346
00:34:47,983 --> 00:34:49,566
Hold your horses.

347
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:57,941
My turn now.

348
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,607
Hurry up, I'm thirsty.

349
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:04,899
Pirro, me too?

350
00:35:05,775 --> 00:35:06,899
Coming up.

351
00:38:51,858 --> 00:38:52,941
Well?

352
00:38:58,483 --> 00:39:01,066
What was in this? He's sick.

353
00:39:01,317 --> 00:39:02,384
Only fernet.

354
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,232
- Only fernet?
- We all drank some.

355
00:39:05,525 --> 00:39:06,947
How do you feel?

356
00:39:08,692 --> 00:39:10,618
- I feel sick!
- He's sick.

357
00:39:10,733 --> 00:39:13,252
- I feel sick...
- I feel sick too.

358
00:39:13,483 --> 00:39:14,816
He's faking it.

359
00:39:14,983 --> 00:39:17,112
He's sick because the rod
found something.

360
00:39:17,192 --> 00:39:20,092
Don't talk rubbish.
You put poison in it!

361
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:23,103
- You're trying to trick me.
- No one wants to trick you.

362
00:39:23,183 --> 00:39:24,987
- I want to dig too.
- Shut up.

363
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:27,511
- You promised.
- We promised you?

364
00:39:27,608 --> 00:39:31,895
Who said anything about digging?
Does it mean so much to you?

365
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:34,826
Then why don't you dig on your own?

366
00:39:34,983 --> 00:39:36,570
- Not on my own.
- Why not?

367
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,028
- Why don't you dig on your own?
- No, not on my own.

368
00:39:40,108 --> 00:39:41,399
Why not?

369
00:39:41,733 --> 00:39:43,403
Because of the spirits.

370
00:39:43,483 --> 00:39:46,570
- You know about the spirits then!
- No, not on my own!

371
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,774
You're afraid of the spirits!
Afraid they'll grab you?

372
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,191
And follow you home!

373
00:39:54,483 --> 00:39:58,107
You're scared
they'll get into bed with you.

374
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:29,941
- Where is it?
- There.

375
00:40:31,067 --> 00:40:32,067
Here?

376
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:45,859
No, that was the wrong note. Listen.

377
00:40:48,983 --> 00:40:50,362
Okay, let's start.

378
00:40:50,442 --> 00:40:56,899
I'd like to explain to you, O God

379
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:04,232
Where my suffering lies

380
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,857
Italia? There's a leak here too.
Bring a bowl.

381
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:33,316
Oh darn this rain!

382
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:38,530
What a disaster!

383
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,607
You're flat.

384
00:41:41,483 --> 00:41:46,524
Your character's asking to speak
to God, to explain her feelings.

385
00:41:46,817 --> 00:41:49,558
It's not the right time to sing flat.

386
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:52,737
Go and do the ironing,
careful with the crease.

387
00:41:52,817 --> 00:41:55,357
Right note, perfect crease.

388
00:41:56,358 --> 00:41:57,958
Are you listening?

389
00:41:59,025 --> 00:42:00,232
Italia...

390
00:42:01,108 --> 00:42:02,788
What a scatterbrain!

391
00:42:03,275 --> 00:42:04,786
Carry on ironing.

392
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,520
- All right, ma'am.
- Discipline.

393
00:42:08,483 --> 00:42:14,149
I'd like to explain to you, O God

394
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:21,566
Where my suffering lies

395
00:42:46,192 --> 00:42:51,566
But fate condemns me

396
00:42:57,108 --> 00:43:02,399
But fate condemns me

397
00:43:03,525 --> 00:43:05,357
To weep

398
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,524
What's that?

399
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,607
It's not "what".

400
00:43:34,067 --> 00:43:35,482
It's who.

401
00:43:42,525 --> 00:43:44,205
Colombina, come here.

402
00:43:44,733 --> 00:43:46,066
Come here!

403
00:43:49,108 --> 00:43:50,708
Take your brother.

404
00:43:50,942 --> 00:43:53,941
Take care of him
and hide in the bedroom.

405
00:43:56,858 --> 00:43:58,649
Don't cry.

406
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,149
Go on!

407
00:44:09,025 --> 00:44:10,877
What are you looking for?

408
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:12,816
An iron rod?

409
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,357
A long one?

410
00:44:17,858 --> 00:44:20,228
I put it on top of the wardrobe.

411
00:44:20,692 --> 00:44:22,320
It looked dangerous.

412
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,566
Italia?

413
00:44:26,817 --> 00:44:28,107
Italia?

414
00:44:32,108 --> 00:44:33,482
Yes, ma'am.

415
00:44:39,983 --> 00:44:41,399
Here it is.

416
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:49,774
Rock.

417
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,482
More rock.

418
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,149
Here it is.

419
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:46,232
Guys, there's a passage.

420
00:45:46,775 --> 00:45:49,145
But someone's already been here.

421
00:45:49,275 --> 00:45:51,732
The stone's smashed!

422
00:46:28,233 --> 00:46:29,441
How horrible!

423
00:46:34,108 --> 00:46:35,816
What can you see?

424
00:46:42,775 --> 00:46:45,237
Look at this... There's nothing here.

425
00:46:45,317 --> 00:46:47,362
- Nothing?
- Not even a fibula?

426
00:46:47,442 --> 00:46:49,042
Not even a ring...

427
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,695
- Here.
- The grave goods are over here.

428
00:46:52,775 --> 00:46:54,479
There's loads of stuff.

429
00:46:54,942 --> 00:46:55,942
Melodie?

430
00:46:56,192 --> 00:46:57,792
- Yes.
- Hold this.

431
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,580
There's a lekythos.

432
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:06,524
Look at this!

433
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:10,607
Red figure.

434
00:47:14,108 --> 00:47:15,149
Lovely.

435
00:47:16,192 --> 00:47:17,649
Grab everything!

436
00:47:33,858 --> 00:47:38,320
Those who work hard come off worse,
they travel on foot, never by horse.

437
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,543
Those who work hard are full of woe,
those who don't, make all the dough!

438
00:47:44,192 --> 00:47:46,903
Let's toast, let's toast,
let's toast!

439
00:47:46,983 --> 00:47:48,524
Katir's here.

440
00:47:51,567 --> 00:47:53,078
Ah, here you are!

441
00:47:53,608 --> 00:47:54,941
Phonies!

442
00:47:55,233 --> 00:47:56,941
You phonies!

443
00:47:57,692 --> 00:48:01,192
You're celebrating with the profits
from my stuff!

444
00:48:01,442 --> 00:48:02,774
Get lost!

445
00:48:04,442 --> 00:48:06,886
Even the pigs would spit you out!

446
00:48:19,525 --> 00:48:23,524
THE POOR "TOMBAROLI"
The Adventures of Arthur the Dowser

447
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:52,987
Friends, we'll sing you a song
that ends badly for those involved,

448
00:48:53,067 --> 00:48:58,024
but at the time they devoted
their hopes and skills

449
00:48:58,317 --> 00:49:01,482
to the cursed need
and desire to upset fate.

450
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:03,774
Now for the first tercet.

451
00:49:05,733 --> 00:49:09,441
There's this stranger,
charming and tall.

452
00:49:09,692 --> 00:49:13,524
From Ireland, or was it England?

453
00:49:14,192 --> 00:49:17,274
And thanks to
his dowsing skills and all

454
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:22,607
he's the real leader of a gang.

455
00:49:24,108 --> 00:49:27,982
In love with archaeology was he

456
00:49:28,608 --> 00:49:32,524
but he never married it
and now he deals in contraband.

457
00:49:32,858 --> 00:49:36,232
Whatever the ground offers up
when they dig

458
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:42,274
to him and his friends
on a grave-robbing gig.

459
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:48,441
They've a connection
with the underground

460
00:49:48,692 --> 00:49:53,816
They're seven grave robbers,
and we call them "tombaroli"

461
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:04,778
Some people rob graves to fulfil
the collective dream of poor peasants,

462
00:50:04,858 --> 00:50:08,816
to find a treasure as a way
of emerging from poverty.

463
00:50:09,692 --> 00:50:11,441
Others are just victims

464
00:50:11,692 --> 00:50:14,487
of the yearning for wealth
that afflicts humanity.

465
00:50:14,567 --> 00:50:18,232
In these cases,
it is easy to resort to villainy.

466
00:50:21,067 --> 00:50:24,524
Not everyone is capable of defying

467
00:50:24,858 --> 00:50:28,857
the law, the darkness
and the souls of the dead.

468
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:32,857
Some people are scared of dying

469
00:50:33,192 --> 00:50:38,524
and others for adventure are bred.

470
00:50:39,608 --> 00:50:43,649
Nights on the lookout
when danger is rife

471
00:50:44,317 --> 00:50:47,774
with flights through woods
with stealth.

472
00:50:48,442 --> 00:50:51,941
It's a thrilling and risky life,

473
00:50:52,233 --> 00:50:57,649
it's the dream of redemption
and wealth.

474
00:51:27,483 --> 00:51:31,524
The poor "tombaroli"
petty criminals for the Law

475
00:51:32,108 --> 00:51:35,732
all they want is a well-paid job

476
00:51:41,817 --> 00:51:45,246
Just think, dear folks,
what the law's there for,

477
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:49,774
to protect those
who exploit your labour.

478
00:51:59,567 --> 00:52:03,149
What's the point of judging then,

479
00:52:03,942 --> 00:52:07,524
the "tombaroli"
are just a drop in the ocean

480
00:52:08,317 --> 00:52:11,774
Ah, a drop in the ocean.

481
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:28,847
I can't see anything.
Let's look over there!

482
00:52:31,775 --> 00:52:35,441
What's the point of judging then,

483
00:52:36,192 --> 00:52:40,274
the "tombaroli"
are just a drop in the ocean

484
00:52:40,567 --> 00:52:44,107
Ah, a drop in the ocean...

485
00:52:58,067 --> 00:52:59,845
There they are! Come on!

486
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:43,524
Hey you... photo.

487
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:45,982
Photo?

488
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:47,482
Photograph.

489
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,066
Wait.

490
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:57,774
There you go.

491
00:53:58,192 --> 00:53:59,987
Oh, thank you. Very nice.

492
00:54:00,067 --> 00:54:01,993
- Nice.
- Is this a temple?

493
00:54:02,275 --> 00:54:04,794
- Yes, yes, temple.
- Nice... nice.

494
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:06,399
Bye Bye.

495
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,732
CRASH COURSE IN ITALIAN

496
00:54:23,733 --> 00:54:25,524
CRAFTY

497
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:33,066
PILFER

498
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:40,857
I'LL "KIL" YOU

499
00:54:44,817 --> 00:54:46,524
SO HEAVY!

500
00:55:25,567 --> 00:55:28,482
Italia? Bring us some tea.

501
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,441
Look...

502
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:37,732
Biscuits...

503
00:55:38,525 --> 00:55:40,941
WE AGREE

504
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,732
SECRET LIAISON

505
00:55:44,317 --> 00:55:46,274
EXCELLENT

506
00:55:46,858 --> 00:55:48,607
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

507
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,982
NOTHING

508
00:55:52,067 --> 00:55:53,067
Thanks.

509
00:55:58,567 --> 00:55:59,649
May I go?

510
00:55:59,942 --> 00:56:01,622
Yes, go on... go on.

511
00:56:12,192 --> 00:56:14,562
Fabiana, how long for the pasta?

512
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:16,191
Just a sec.

513
00:56:23,525 --> 00:56:25,024
Careful.

514
00:56:29,525 --> 00:56:30,857
Forks!

515
00:57:49,983 --> 00:57:52,862
- I'll get the thermos flask.
- Good girl.

516
00:57:52,942 --> 00:57:56,653
She forgot the thermos flask
but we're about to leave.

517
00:57:56,733 --> 00:57:58,955
You're coming too, aren't you?

518
00:57:59,067 --> 00:58:00,400
Yes, of course.

519
00:58:02,192 --> 00:58:04,044
Arthur, you're so thin...

520
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:06,524
Really thin.

521
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,812
- Are you eating?
- Yes.

522
00:58:14,942 --> 00:58:18,987
When Beniamina comes back and
sees you like that. it's not good.

523
00:58:19,067 --> 00:58:23,191
Get some biscuits from the kitchen.
They'll buck you up.

524
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,987
I've told you before,
madam mustn't see you.

525
00:58:27,067 --> 00:58:29,660
- Mummy, can we come with you?
- No.

526
00:58:30,817 --> 00:58:32,774
I said no!

527
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,580
How long will you be?

528
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:38,399
I'm coming.

529
00:58:39,942 --> 00:58:44,524
A couple of hours. When you hear
the gate, go to your room.

530
00:58:45,192 --> 00:58:47,044
- Please!
- That's enough.

531
00:58:47,483 --> 00:58:48,483
Bye.

532
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:50,817
Bye.

533
00:58:53,067 --> 00:58:54,566
Look after him.

534
00:59:03,233 --> 00:59:04,233
Wait.

535
00:59:12,067 --> 00:59:13,566
May I?

536
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:29,982
What's that?

537
00:59:31,733 --> 00:59:35,191
It's a thing that rings.

538
00:59:36,192 --> 00:59:37,399
May I?

539
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:39,107
Yes.

540
00:59:44,733 --> 00:59:45,982
Bell.

541
00:59:46,442 --> 00:59:48,232
It's called a bell.

542
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:50,982
Madam calls for me with a bell.

543
00:59:52,775 --> 00:59:54,357
You can keep it.

544
00:59:55,567 --> 00:59:56,857
A present?

545
00:59:57,942 --> 00:59:59,622
- For me?
- Let's go.

546
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:01,191
Thanks, but...

547
01:00:01,567 --> 01:00:02,567
Wait...

548
01:00:03,483 --> 01:00:05,335
Look, that's the station.

549
01:00:05,567 --> 01:00:08,357
- Okay, yes.
- We're nearly there.

550
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,794
I yearned to see this place again.

551
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,399
The city and the countryside.

552
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:23,641
I often came to this station

553
01:00:23,817 --> 01:00:26,445
to pick up my daughters
back from a trip...

554
01:00:26,525 --> 01:00:30,399
RI-PAR-BEL-LA.

555
01:00:30,817 --> 01:00:34,103
- This leg is still a bit painful.
- Riparbella.

556
01:00:34,192 --> 01:00:38,362
I encouraged my daughters to travel.
It's important to travel...

557
01:00:38,442 --> 01:00:40,237
I couldn't hold Beniamina back...

558
01:00:40,317 --> 01:00:43,674
she'd jump on any train.
She's really curious...

559
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:47,195
She'll have so much to tell us
when she returns.

560
01:00:47,275 --> 01:00:51,347
- Who does it belong to now, ma'am?
- The station? No one.

561
01:00:52,317 --> 01:00:53,695
What do you mean?

562
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:57,061
It's a public building.
It belongs to everyone.

563
01:00:57,442 --> 01:01:00,183
Does it belong to everyone or no one?

564
01:01:00,692 --> 01:01:02,292
Stop nitpicking...

565
01:01:03,067 --> 01:01:04,993
It's an abandoned station.

566
01:01:56,425 --> 01:01:59,299
All right then.
I'll see you next week.

567
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,799
Good morning. We brought the puppies.

568
01:02:06,217 --> 01:02:07,897
Just a minute, please.

569
01:02:11,633 --> 01:02:13,313
The Englishman's here.

570
01:02:13,842 --> 01:02:15,175
Yes, he's here.

571
01:02:15,342 --> 01:02:17,132
- Is that a puppy?
- Yes.

572
01:02:17,592 --> 01:02:20,036
- Can I have a look?
- Better not.

573
01:02:20,467 --> 01:02:21,716
It's sick.

574
01:02:23,175 --> 01:02:26,176
Mr Harrison, what a surprise!
Welcome back.

575
01:02:26,467 --> 01:02:27,800
Please come in.

576
01:02:28,342 --> 01:02:30,553
Excuse me, but I was here first.

577
01:02:30,633 --> 01:02:33,549
It's a special case, ma'am.
An emergency.

578
01:02:46,758 --> 01:02:50,382
Spartaco will be very happy
that you're back.

579
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,504
- How many pieces?
- 18.

580
01:02:54,633 --> 01:02:55,633
18.

581
01:02:57,133 --> 01:02:59,133
- Is that all?
- That's all.

582
01:03:30,633 --> 01:03:32,313
He's weighing them up.

583
01:03:36,633 --> 01:03:39,882
Spartaco says,
"You've remembered me at last."

584
01:03:40,217 --> 01:03:43,432
Listen, keep my share.
I don't want any debts.

585
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:45,230
Only his share though.

586
01:03:45,925 --> 01:03:48,845
Spartaco was expecting
better after all this time.

587
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:50,132
What?

588
01:03:50,425 --> 01:03:54,095
There's a lekythos from IV BC,
with the veiled woman.

589
01:03:54,175 --> 01:03:55,257
Very rare!

590
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:57,445
- What about the kylix?
- And the running fawn?

591
01:03:57,525 --> 01:04:00,497
Spartaco says
they're just everyday objects.

592
01:04:00,758 --> 01:04:02,832
- Tombs of poor folk.
- What?

593
01:04:02,925 --> 01:04:06,216
- They weren't all pharaohs!
- It's absurd.

594
01:04:07,717 --> 01:04:09,049
Received.

595
01:04:09,633 --> 01:04:11,424
He'll take it all.

596
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:14,341
The payment.

597
01:04:18,883 --> 01:04:21,698
- Take it or leave it.
- We'll take it.

598
01:04:33,633 --> 01:04:35,485
Check if they've expired.

599
01:04:49,342 --> 01:04:50,409
This shovel?

600
01:04:50,842 --> 01:04:53,064
What do you need a shovel for?

601
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:55,928
To plant beans, officer.

602
01:04:56,008 --> 01:04:58,601
Beans at this time of year? No way.

603
01:04:59,008 --> 01:05:01,678
Maybe that's why
they didn't sprout, Melchiorre.

604
01:05:01,758 --> 01:05:04,901
- I told you it wasn't time.
- I didn't know.

605
01:05:05,342 --> 01:05:08,628
Don't act smart,
we've got our eyes on you all.

606
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,216
Especially him, the Englishman.

607
01:05:11,758 --> 01:05:12,799
Got that?

608
01:05:15,008 --> 01:05:16,712
- Your papers.
- Thanks.

609
01:05:16,925 --> 01:05:17,925
Sorry

610
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,174
May I? Thanks.

611
01:05:21,467 --> 01:05:24,053
What's that?
Is that property of the state?

612
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:25,970
- Which one?
- That there.

613
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:27,206
- This?
- Yes.

614
01:05:27,425 --> 01:05:29,137
Is it property of the state?

615
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:31,341
No, this is mine...

616
01:05:31,633 --> 01:05:34,424
What did you cal it, Arthur?

617
01:05:34,675 --> 01:05:36,675
It's an apotropaic phallus.

618
01:05:36,925 --> 01:05:38,605
A "troparic" phallus.

619
01:05:38,883 --> 01:05:42,095
- You know what that is, right?
- I know what troparic means.

620
01:05:42,175 --> 01:05:43,595
Yes, I've seen them.

621
01:05:43,675 --> 01:05:46,549
His granddad gave it
to my granddad...

622
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:56,341
Mario?

623
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:00,152
- This is yours.
- Thanks.

624
01:06:00,758 --> 01:06:02,720
- I'll count it.
- Go ahead.

625
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,512
- I'm 50, 000 liras short.
- Count it again.

626
01:06:05,592 --> 01:06:07,962
Jerry and I got less than Mario.

627
01:06:08,967 --> 01:06:12,303
We could build a cabin like this
Would you like it?

628
01:06:12,383 --> 01:06:13,627
It's horrible.

629
01:06:13,717 --> 01:06:15,424
It's my round tonight.

630
01:06:16,592 --> 01:06:17,592
Arthur.

631
01:06:20,592 --> 01:06:22,888
I wanted to show them your home

632
01:06:24,217 --> 01:06:25,217
Hi.

633
01:06:25,967 --> 01:06:27,745
She's like a broomstick!

634
01:06:31,592 --> 01:06:32,882
She kissed him

635
01:06:33,217 --> 01:06:34,728
All these people.

636
01:06:35,342 --> 01:06:36,716
Cirillo.

637
01:06:37,633 --> 01:06:38,882
Colombina.

638
01:06:39,758 --> 01:06:41,091
and I'm Italia.

639
01:06:42,175 --> 01:06:44,249
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

640
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:46,257
Long live Italia!

641
01:06:56,467 --> 01:06:58,341
You put the ice in first.

642
01:06:58,633 --> 01:07:00,887
Who taught you to mix drinks?
You're an idiot!

643
01:07:00,967 --> 01:07:02,549
I said it's fine.

644
01:07:03,342 --> 01:07:04,342
Thanks.

645
01:07:16,717 --> 01:07:18,720
Great! Long live Italia. Let's toast!

646
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,133
I'll take this.

647
01:08:30,258 --> 01:08:33,758
She might be a broomstick
but she's good with men.

648
01:08:39,342 --> 01:08:41,841
I want to sing too!

649
01:08:42,592 --> 01:08:44,512
- CanI sing?
- Is he going?

650
01:08:44,592 --> 01:08:46,272
What's Katir doing?

651
01:08:46,925 --> 01:08:48,081
Go on, Katir!

652
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:49,581
Go on, Katir!

653
01:08:53,633 --> 01:08:55,007
Come on, Katir!

654
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:06,175
Thanks.

655
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:08,841
Cool, Katir!

656
01:09:10,258 --> 01:09:12,406
Hooray for the power station!

657
01:10:15,425 --> 01:10:17,091
Get 'em off!

658
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,800
Come here.

659
01:11:18,508 --> 01:11:19,549
My mates...

660
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,257
Such assholes!

661
01:11:35,633 --> 01:11:38,341
Come on, let's go.

662
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:45,841
Arthur.

663
01:11:46,633 --> 01:11:48,341
Come on!

664
01:11:48,633 --> 01:11:52,174
Jerry, don't get wet!
Keep away from me if you do!

665
01:11:52,467 --> 01:11:53,889
It's disgusting!

666
01:11:59,467 --> 01:12:01,467
Guys, look what I've found.

667
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:04,230
The Euphronios Krater!

668
01:12:04,508 --> 01:12:07,428
You're braver than me
taking a dip in that water.

669
01:12:07,508 --> 01:12:09,656
There's toxic waste in there.

670
01:12:11,258 --> 01:12:14,382
Fabiana, this is electrifying water!

671
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,448
I came out in a rash last time

672
01:12:17,675 --> 01:12:19,355
It improves your looks

673
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:28,091
- Have a swim.
- Grab Pirro.

674
01:12:28,592 --> 01:12:29,925
No, grab Mario.

675
01:13:00,842 --> 01:13:04,128
What have you done to him?
You've cast a spell.

676
01:13:04,508 --> 01:13:06,091
You're a witch.

677
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:08,855
What is this place?

678
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:10,980
It looks like a tip.

679
01:13:11,175 --> 01:13:14,220
No, we always come here.
It's a kind of cemetery.

680
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,091
Just look at those guys!

681
01:13:17,758 --> 01:13:19,757
Cemetery? In what way?

682
01:13:20,342 --> 01:13:21,674
In what way...

683
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:26,550
See those holes... That one,
and that one, they're tombs.

684
01:13:27,675 --> 01:13:28,841
Well done.

685
01:13:29,175 --> 01:13:31,916
Let's get out of here. It's horrible.

686
01:13:32,217 --> 01:13:33,550
Are you scared?

687
01:13:33,633 --> 01:13:35,178
Yeah, you're scared.

688
01:13:35,258 --> 01:13:37,925
Long-live-ltalia is scared of tombs.

689
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:40,507
They're 2000 years old!

690
01:14:02,925 --> 01:14:05,855
The maestro has felt something!
Watch out!

691
01:14:08,258 --> 01:14:10,424
Is he sick? What's wrong?

692
01:14:10,675 --> 01:14:12,897
No, he's lost in his chimeras.

693
01:14:13,592 --> 01:14:15,591
Hasn't he told you?

694
01:14:15,883 --> 01:14:18,031
- How we make our money?
- No.

695
01:14:18,217 --> 01:14:19,845
Go and get the tools.

696
01:14:19,925 --> 01:14:21,382
We open tombs.

697
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:32,641
Tonight of all nights

698
01:14:32,721 --> 01:14:36,621
when we're in our best clothes you
have to go after your visions!

699
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:40,299
Well?

700
01:14:40,842 --> 01:14:42,716
Hold it... hold it!

701
01:14:44,508 --> 01:14:47,595
Let them concentrate,
they might find something.

702
01:14:47,675 --> 01:14:49,049
Something?

703
01:14:49,383 --> 01:14:51,007
The grave goods.

704
01:14:52,383 --> 01:14:55,198
- What?
- The stuff they left the dead.

705
01:14:55,425 --> 01:14:59,591
They believed they helped
to save their souls, right?

706
01:15:00,383 --> 01:15:01,345
The souls...

707
01:15:01,425 --> 01:15:04,711
Fabiana, go and check
no one's coming. Move it!

708
01:15:04,842 --> 01:15:07,286
Fabiana do this, Fabiana do that.

709
01:15:15,467 --> 01:15:16,467
Arthur...

710
01:15:18,592 --> 01:15:20,595
did this belong to a dead person?

711
01:15:20,675 --> 01:15:23,091
Let me see... it's possible.

712
01:15:24,425 --> 01:15:26,049
A child's grave.

713
01:15:27,342 --> 01:15:30,007
Fabiana, help me stop them.

714
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,670
- Please!
- No, leave them to it.

715
01:15:33,633 --> 01:15:36,990
What are they going to do?
Steal from the souls?

716
01:15:37,592 --> 01:15:39,814
What a pain in the ass she is!

717
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:45,466
Those things aren't made
for human eyes...

718
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:49,230
but those of souls.

719
01:15:52,258 --> 01:15:53,887
What the fuck was that?

720
01:15:53,967 --> 01:15:57,539
Hear that, Arthur?
They aren't made for human eyes.

721
01:15:58,467 --> 01:16:02,262
Miss, we really liked you before,
but now you're being a pain.

722
01:16:02,342 --> 01:16:03,507
Go away!

723
01:16:06,258 --> 01:16:08,303
- Fabiana, help me.
- Be quiet!

724
01:16:08,383 --> 01:16:10,928
- We have to call the police.
- What?

725
01:16:11,008 --> 01:16:13,527
- The police?
- Be quiet, you fool!

726
01:16:15,508 --> 01:16:17,188
What about Beniamina?

727
01:16:18,175 --> 01:16:20,101
Does she know what you do?

728
01:16:24,467 --> 01:16:27,257
He didn't tell you Beniamina's dead?

729
01:16:29,883 --> 01:16:31,091
Just great!

730
01:16:33,758 --> 01:16:35,424
Go home.

731
01:16:38,508 --> 01:16:39,799
What the fuck!

732
01:16:41,008 --> 01:16:43,527
- Let's go.
- That's how it's done.

733
01:16:44,467 --> 01:16:46,171
I'll come back for you.

734
01:16:47,133 --> 01:16:50,382
- Get rid of the broomstick.
- Get lost!

735
01:16:51,008 --> 01:16:52,507
I curse you!

736
01:16:54,508 --> 01:16:57,424
That's enough.
You're asking for trouble!

737
01:17:00,842 --> 01:17:03,742
If they tell you to shut up,
you shut up!

738
01:17:03,925 --> 01:17:07,174
Are you listening? What a nerve...

739
01:17:07,717 --> 01:17:08,717
Go on.

740
01:17:08,967 --> 01:17:11,897
I can feel something.
We need to widen it.

741
01:17:19,008 --> 01:17:20,257
Go on...

742
01:17:21,883 --> 01:17:22,883
Mario!

743
01:17:23,175 --> 01:17:24,424
Let me see.

744
01:17:26,717 --> 01:17:29,007
Feckin'hell, it's untouched!

745
01:17:43,842 --> 01:17:45,674
It's still sealed.

746
01:18:04,758 --> 01:18:06,438
Careful. careful...

747
01:18:08,633 --> 01:18:10,470
- Wedge it in there.
- Further down.

748
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:11,550
Wait!

749
01:18:35,258 --> 01:18:36,858
Give me the torch.

750
01:18:49,425 --> 01:18:51,499
Mario, pass me your lighter.

751
01:19:16,633 --> 01:19:17,633
Oh God!

752
01:19:17,883 --> 01:19:19,841
- Some animals.
- Jeez!

753
01:19:20,175 --> 01:19:21,242
How sweet...

754
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:26,212
They look like votive offerings.

755
01:19:26,592 --> 01:19:28,272
There's some water.

756
01:19:55,008 --> 01:19:56,934
It's covered in paintings.

757
01:19:58,633 --> 01:20:01,299
This is amazing. Just look at this.

758
01:20:04,342 --> 01:20:05,942
This is beautiful.

759
01:20:09,258 --> 01:20:10,341
Oh, God!

760
01:20:12,758 --> 01:20:14,462
Never mind the souls...

761
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:18,007
The Etruscans left these here for us.

762
01:20:20,133 --> 01:20:23,033
She's been waiting for us
for 2000 years!

763
01:20:25,633 --> 01:20:27,799
It's a gift to us!

764
01:20:28,133 --> 01:20:29,799
This is amazing!

765
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,874
Just look at all this stuff!

766
01:20:36,217 --> 01:20:38,007
Mario... It's a goddess.

767
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:40,257
I don't believe it...

768
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:43,679
This is not some funeral stuff.

769
01:20:43,967 --> 01:20:45,299
It's a shrine.

770
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:47,757
A temple.

771
01:20:50,883 --> 01:20:52,387
This will make us all rich.

772
01:20:52,467 --> 01:20:55,091
How do we get it out of here?

773
01:20:56,467 --> 01:20:57,845
We don't even have the car.

774
01:20:57,925 --> 01:21:01,137
We'll carry it outside for now.
Then hide it in the wood.

775
01:21:01,217 --> 01:21:04,137
Then we'll load it into the car
when Fabiana gets here.

776
01:21:04,217 --> 01:21:05,728
Come on, come on.

777
01:21:06,842 --> 01:21:08,303
I'll put it here.

778
01:21:08,383 --> 01:21:10,382
- Ready?
- Once sharp blow.

779
01:21:11,008 --> 01:21:12,341
One sharp blow.

780
01:21:13,008 --> 01:21:14,008
Perfect.

781
01:21:15,717 --> 01:21:17,007
Pass it to me.

782
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:22,323
Jerry, let's section it here.

783
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:24,507
What?

784
01:21:25,175 --> 01:21:28,176
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Calm down!

785
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,374
- What the fuck!
- Calm down.

786
01:21:30,633 --> 01:21:32,633
We'll put it back together.

787
01:21:32,925 --> 01:21:36,507
We've done it before.
We'll take it out in pieces.

788
01:21:38,467 --> 01:21:41,208
How else would we get it out of here?

789
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:43,744
We'll put it back together again.

790
01:21:44,675 --> 01:21:46,049
Take it easy.

791
01:21:46,675 --> 01:21:49,342
- Easy.
- We'll put it back together.

792
01:21:50,383 --> 01:21:51,383
Fuck...

793
01:21:56,175 --> 01:21:57,597
I'll go and see.

794
01:22:02,258 --> 01:22:03,841
We have to run.

795
01:22:04,925 --> 01:22:07,926
My father wil kill me
if we end up in jail.

796
01:22:20,967 --> 01:22:23,216
She really did call the cops.

797
01:22:26,383 --> 01:22:28,216
There are two of them.

798
01:22:28,508 --> 01:22:30,108
We outnumber them.

799
01:22:30,383 --> 01:22:32,063
Fuck, they'll nab us.

800
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,670
- Hey, calm down.
- Two officers.

801
01:22:38,633 --> 01:22:40,633
- Two of them...
- Two what?

802
01:22:41,217 --> 01:22:42,299
Two cars.

803
01:22:44,008 --> 01:22:45,466
How many men?

804
01:22:46,342 --> 01:22:50,466
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

805
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:53,694
Have they upped the police budget?

806
01:22:55,258 --> 01:22:57,595
There are too many of them,
we have to run!

807
01:22:57,675 --> 01:22:58,675
Come on.

808
01:23:06,008 --> 01:23:08,595
Let's go,
the place is crawling with cops.

809
01:23:08,675 --> 01:23:11,194
- Come on, guys!
- Drop everything.

810
01:23:20,883 --> 01:23:22,563
You liked jail then?

811
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,757
Arthur, Arthur!

812
01:23:38,008 --> 01:23:39,519
Let's go, Arthur!

813
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:44,049
There they are!

814
01:23:44,342 --> 01:23:46,022
Where are you going?

815
01:23:47,342 --> 01:23:48,428
Do something!

816
01:23:48,508 --> 01:23:50,188
There's another one!

817
01:23:50,717 --> 01:23:51,841
There, look!

818
01:23:53,592 --> 01:23:54,925
There they are!

819
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:03,550
Suckers!

820
01:24:11,717 --> 01:24:13,397
- Arthur!
- Come on.

821
01:24:25,925 --> 01:24:27,925
Arthur! What have you done?

822
01:24:29,175 --> 01:24:32,075
- That's all we needed!
- Bring him here.

823
01:24:33,258 --> 01:24:34,299
Darn it!

824
01:24:34,967 --> 01:24:36,007
Why?

825
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:38,744
Why aren't they chasing after us?

826
01:24:39,217 --> 01:24:43,504
- Thank goodness they're not.
- Damn it! We'd struck it rich.

827
01:24:44,467 --> 01:24:47,507
Why aren't they chasing us? Why?!

828
01:25:06,008 --> 01:25:08,424
"Police"

829
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:14,341
Rospo, bring me that rope.

830
01:25:15,175 --> 01:25:16,799
Get a move on.

831
01:27:24,758 --> 01:27:25,825
Close it up.

832
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:32,367
Close it up.

833
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:33,550
Thanks.

834
01:29:24,342 --> 01:29:26,095
- What's wrong?
- It's Arthur.

835
01:29:26,175 --> 01:29:28,553
- He's come back.
- I thought it was a ghost.

836
01:29:28,633 --> 01:29:29,757
It's Arthur.

837
01:29:32,967 --> 01:29:36,178
- I'll get you a drink, Mum.
- We kicked her out.

838
01:29:36,258 --> 01:29:38,928
- She found the kids.
- Italia. the witch!

839
01:29:39,008 --> 01:29:41,262
I told you that girl
was a piece of trash.

840
01:29:41,342 --> 01:29:44,220
- I never liked her.
- I heard the baby crying.

841
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,091
We all said so. Stop it.

842
01:29:46,592 --> 01:29:49,595
Know what Mum found out?
She wasn't hiding one child...

843
01:29:49,675 --> 01:29:51,097
- But two!
- Yes.

844
01:29:51,217 --> 01:29:54,137
- Maybe more than two.
- And you made fun of me...

845
01:29:54,217 --> 01:29:56,095
- Here you are, Mum.
- "A little lamb"...

846
01:29:56,175 --> 01:29:58,012
She took Mum's thermos flask.

847
01:29:58,092 --> 01:30:00,674
I'd have taken it if I'd known.

848
01:30:00,967 --> 01:30:03,382
She's a liar and a thief.

849
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:09,591
It must have been awful
to find those children there.

850
01:30:11,467 --> 01:30:13,674
You were children once too.

851
01:30:14,425 --> 01:30:16,803
Poor kids, she hid them
under her bed.

852
01:30:16,883 --> 01:30:18,674
How do you feel now?

853
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:21,050
Old.

854
01:30:28,467 --> 01:30:30,257
It's this house, Mum.

855
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:33,387
It's falling to bits. It's a hovel...

856
01:30:33,467 --> 01:30:36,896
Can't you feel the damp,
it's not good for you...

857
01:30:37,092 --> 01:30:39,833
We'll find you a nicer place to live.

858
01:30:40,092 --> 01:30:41,870
No more singing lessons.

859
01:30:42,008 --> 01:30:45,512
You'll see, Mum, we've found
this beautiful nursing home.

860
01:30:45,592 --> 01:30:47,012
They'll look after you.

861
01:30:47,092 --> 01:30:50,303
A big garden, lots of flowers,
you'll meet new friends...

862
01:30:50,383 --> 01:30:52,466
It's for your own good, Mum.

863
01:30:52,925 --> 01:30:55,466
Can I have this? You don't use it.

864
01:30:56,383 --> 01:30:58,012
Or did you want it?

865
01:30:58,092 --> 01:31:01,095
- We'll sell everything in here.
- This is madness!

866
01:31:01,175 --> 01:31:03,178
What if Beniamina were to come back?

867
01:31:03,258 --> 01:31:05,999
There won't be anyone
waiting for her.

868
01:31:08,508 --> 01:31:11,466
Mum, she's not coming back.

869
01:31:33,717 --> 01:31:36,095
- Spartaco.
- There's no one here. We're closing.

870
01:31:36,175 --> 01:31:38,303
Open the door, it's important.

871
01:31:38,383 --> 01:31:40,063
Then call him for us.

872
01:31:40,467 --> 01:31:44,754
I'll talk to him, I'll smash
this phone if he doesn't answer.

873
01:31:46,092 --> 01:31:47,924
- Pirro!
- Melodie?

874
01:31:48,717 --> 01:31:50,228
Where's Spartaco?

875
01:31:50,383 --> 01:31:53,757
Spartaco isn't here.
He'll be back next week.

876
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:56,466
Do you need anything?

877
01:31:57,467 --> 01:31:59,049
Can I help you?

878
01:32:50,592 --> 01:32:51,592
Please...

879
01:33:19,967 --> 01:33:21,478
The back, please.

880
01:33:30,592 --> 01:33:31,592
Details

881
01:33:45,342 --> 01:33:46,342
Please.

882
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,928
Which one's Spartaco?

883
01:34:08,008 --> 01:34:10,823
That's her, my aunt.
She's very strict.

884
01:34:11,008 --> 01:34:13,345
That's Spartaco... the blonde woman.

885
01:34:13,425 --> 01:34:14,924
Scheming bitch!

886
01:34:15,175 --> 01:34:16,382
Be quiet!

887
01:34:20,342 --> 01:34:22,342
Excuse me, look who's here.

888
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:26,132
Documents.

889
01:34:29,967 --> 01:34:31,567
Documents, please.

890
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:36,924
The documents!

891
01:35:09,008 --> 01:35:11,304
Why have you brought them here?

892
01:35:12,883 --> 01:35:15,970
This is a private auction,
for museum curators.

893
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:17,730
But, it's important.

894
01:35:18,092 --> 01:35:21,449
The Englishman is here.
You have to talk to him.

895
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:24,049
Listen, Spartaco...

896
01:35:29,967 --> 01:35:32,049
Finally you can see my face.

897
01:35:32,842 --> 01:35:34,049
Wait!

898
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:38,632
My niece had a lot of fun
witnessing your...

899
01:35:39,633 --> 01:35:41,337
What is it you call it?

900
01:35:41,633 --> 01:35:43,313
Oh, yes, your gift.

901
01:35:46,217 --> 01:35:47,217
Here.

902
01:35:50,217 --> 01:35:52,632
The gift of finding lost things.

903
01:35:52,725 --> 01:35:53,925
Aunt...

904
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:57,595
Excuse me, the Americans
want to talk to you.

905
01:35:58,175 --> 01:36:00,428
Pour them some more champagne.
Go on!

906
01:36:00,508 --> 01:36:01,882
Quick.

907
01:36:02,017 --> 01:36:03,917
I'll be right there, go on!

908
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:15,212
You can soil your clothes and act
the crook as much as you want...

909
01:36:15,292 --> 01:36:18,222
but you'll never change
from what you are.

910
01:36:54,842 --> 01:36:56,442
What's she saying?

911
01:36:58,133 --> 01:37:02,466
I was asking my friend Arthur
if you like my statue.

912
01:37:04,017 --> 01:37:06,437
Didn't our friend Arthur tell you?

913
01:37:06,517 --> 01:37:09,103
That's what we've come for,
the statue.

914
01:37:09,183 --> 01:37:10,605
It's ours and...

915
01:37:10,808 --> 01:37:11,849
Nonsense:

916
01:37:12,042 --> 01:37:14,420
The statue already has
a certificate of origin.

917
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,453
- And we have the noddle.
- The what?

918
01:37:16,533 --> 01:37:20,616
The head. We found the statue.
And we have the head.

919
01:37:22,242 --> 01:37:24,282
Yes, it's in here.

920
01:37:25,033 --> 01:37:27,532
Come here, Arthur, you take it.

921
01:37:27,825 --> 01:37:29,899
I told you it was important.

922
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:42,532
You said the statue is priceless.
How much is the head worth?

923
01:37:46,725 --> 01:37:49,353
- Are you blackmailing me?
- Yes, we are.

924
01:37:49,433 --> 01:37:54,362
Or we'll walk in there and tell your
friends where you get your finds.

925
01:37:55,558 --> 01:37:58,812
Show me this head.
Let's see if it's worth anything.

926
01:37:58,892 --> 01:38:00,478
- Price first.
- Head first.

927
01:38:00,558 --> 01:38:02,103
- Money first...
- Head first.

928
01:38:02,183 --> 01:38:03,250
Price first!

929
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:06,228
Don't push your luck,
I'm the only one who can buy it.

930
01:38:06,308 --> 01:38:07,687
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

931
01:38:07,767 --> 01:38:10,312
- We'll see about that... Messieurs?
- Quiet. It'll be a fake.

932
01:38:10,392 --> 01:38:11,937
- What?
- It's real.

933
01:38:12,017 --> 01:38:13,849
It's real, we found it.

934
01:38:14,475 --> 01:38:17,216
The price.
we want to hear your price.

935
01:38:17,475 --> 01:38:19,099
The price.

936
01:38:30,858 --> 01:38:33,566
Arthur, my dear...

937
01:38:34,808 --> 01:38:36,757
show me this head.

938
01:38:59,892 --> 01:39:01,562
You've seen it now

939
01:39:31,558 --> 01:39:34,349
You're not made for human eyes.

940
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:41,725
Arthur...

941
01:39:46,183 --> 01:39:48,141
It looks interesting.

942
01:39:53,058 --> 01:39:54,302
What the fuck?

943
01:41:19,933 --> 01:41:21,141
Excuse me...

944
01:41:21,933 --> 01:41:23,349
Oh, it's you!

945
01:41:25,017 --> 01:41:26,849
Have you got a light?

946
01:41:30,683 --> 01:41:32,932
Keep it. You might need it.

947
01:41:37,767 --> 01:41:39,447
While you're here...

948
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,280
I wanted to ask you.

949
01:41:42,558 --> 01:41:45,682
You don't know what happened
to my goods?

950
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:47,141
Your what?

951
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:51,474
My grave goods.

952
01:41:52,267 --> 01:41:54,849
There was a painted askos,

953
01:41:55,642 --> 01:41:59,724
and two grey ceramic ollas,
a large one and a smaller one,

954
01:42:00,475 --> 01:42:03,937
there was also a golden fibula,
it was pinned here.

955
01:42:04,017 --> 01:42:07,099
It meant a lot to me,
so I thought maybe.

956
01:42:09,517 --> 01:42:10,974
But l...

957
01:42:14,683 --> 01:42:16,363
I don't understand.

958
01:42:16,642 --> 01:42:18,307
Forgive me.

959
01:42:18,683 --> 01:42:20,978
While you're here,
we have a question.

960
01:42:21,058 --> 01:42:23,562
We've lost part of
our grave goods too.

961
01:42:23,642 --> 01:42:27,812
There was a kylix with eyes on it,
the big ones for drinking...

962
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:31,141
- What was painted on it?
- A fawn running.

963
01:42:32,017 --> 01:42:34,103
It was nice, I really liked it.

964
01:42:34,183 --> 01:42:38,541
Whereas they'd left me a little bell
with a little bird on it.

965
01:42:38,642 --> 01:42:41,086
- It was nice.
- It was in bronze.

966
01:42:42,183 --> 01:42:43,694
Have you seen it?

967
01:42:43,892 --> 01:42:45,599
Buddy... buddy.

968
01:42:45,892 --> 01:42:48,040
Fancy that... look who it is!

969
01:42:48,558 --> 01:42:51,915
Wait a sec, please.
I need to ask you something.

970
01:42:52,433 --> 01:42:53,849
Thanks, may I?

971
01:42:54,225 --> 01:42:56,766
I wanted to ask you if you've seen

972
01:42:57,017 --> 01:43:00,516
Something that was mine
but I can't find it...

973
01:44:07,392 --> 01:44:14,641
In the world's soul,
there's death, love and life

974
01:44:15,267 --> 01:44:22,432
Lots of mystery deep down,
joy and strife.

975
01:44:30,933 --> 01:44:38,099
But if humans were
more like birds in flight,

976
01:44:38,683 --> 01:44:45,932
if they didn't crave
treasure shining bright,

977
01:44:46,433 --> 01:44:50,520
they'd live in better harmony
between bliss and the arcane.

978
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:54,391
Not alienated from the sacred
and the profane,

979
01:44:54,725 --> 01:44:58,516
nor afflicted by immediate gain,

980
01:44:58,892 --> 01:45:03,724
by the anxiety of profit
which only adds to the strain.

981
01:45:05,683 --> 01:45:13,141
And while they concluded
this important deal,

982
01:45:13,475 --> 01:45:20,766
rebellion raged in the stranger
with his nerves of steel.

983
01:45:29,183 --> 01:45:32,599
But he was misunderstood,

984
01:45:32,975 --> 01:45:36,682
they considered him mad,

985
01:45:36,933 --> 01:45:44,182
they gave him a hard time,
this fool turned bad.

986
01:45:44,558 --> 01:45:48,182
They shouted insults
and their amazement grew

987
01:45:48,517 --> 01:45:51,946
but he was left untouched
by whatever they threw.

988
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:56,516
All he longed for was a fuller life,

989
01:45:56,808 --> 01:46:01,474
his heart nourished
by a richer source

990
01:46:20,767 --> 01:46:24,641
He tried to fly, fly over the hills

991
01:46:25,642 --> 01:46:29,391
but he remained on the ground
with all his old ills.

992
01:46:30,975 --> 01:46:34,849
He decided to come back
after wandering around

993
01:46:35,808 --> 01:46:39,641
But he found
that everything had changed

994
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:44,557
Too much had changed.

995
01:47:08,975 --> 01:47:10,682
Melchiorre...

996
01:47:11,517 --> 01:47:14,036
Forget about him. He's dead to us.

997
01:47:14,558 --> 01:47:16,849
Let's have a toast.

998
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:25,432
Mister, mister...

999
01:47:27,267 --> 01:47:29,489
Come here, I'm talking to you.

1000
01:47:31,142 --> 01:47:32,822
What are you doing?

1001
01:47:33,475 --> 01:47:36,145
- Well?
- Look at the state you're in.

1002
01:47:36,225 --> 01:47:39,440
- What the fuck have you done?
- You're a total mess.

1003
01:47:39,767 --> 01:47:42,437
- Come and eat with us.
- Yes, come on.

1004
01:47:42,517 --> 01:47:45,946
We'll get rid of those wretched
friends of yours.

1005
01:47:46,183 --> 01:47:47,863
They're fucking thick!

1006
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:51,687
- We'll treat him to dinner one day.
- Yeah, we'll take him with us.

1007
01:47:51,767 --> 01:47:54,656
A nice place.
with a nice glass of wine.

1008
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:59,029
A good meal to strengthen you up,
you look like a fakir.

1009
01:47:59,183 --> 01:48:02,391
Just look at the state this guy's in.

1010
01:48:02,683 --> 01:48:05,599
We'll spend a nice day together.

1011
01:48:05,892 --> 01:48:08,187
We'll take you to this nice place.

1012
01:48:08,267 --> 01:48:09,947
- A nice place.
- Okay?

1013
01:48:12,142 --> 01:48:13,432
When?

1014
01:48:22,975 --> 01:48:24,141
Hey!

1015
01:48:32,933 --> 01:48:35,863
If you want to see Mum,
clean yourself up.

1016
01:48:39,308 --> 01:48:40,849
That's an order.

1017
01:48:44,892 --> 01:48:46,099
This one?

1018
01:48:46,433 --> 01:48:47,433
Eh2

1019
01:48:48,183 --> 01:48:49,183
Yes.

1020
01:49:03,392 --> 01:49:05,170
Is he going to the ball?

1021
01:49:13,933 --> 01:49:15,533
- Shall I?
- Go on.

1022
01:49:21,392 --> 01:49:23,318
- A bit shorter.
- Shorter?

1023
01:49:32,475 --> 01:49:34,099
Give me a hand.

1024
01:49:39,433 --> 01:49:41,729
- Is that better?
- Much better.

1025
01:49:47,767 --> 01:49:48,767
This un?

1026
01:49:49,183 --> 01:49:50,183
This one!

1027
01:50:13,975 --> 01:50:15,932
It's changed a bit.

1028
01:50:33,017 --> 01:50:34,017
Hi.

1029
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:41,599
Hey, who are you?

1030
01:50:42,058 --> 01:50:43,058
Hello.

1031
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:54,474
May I?

1032
01:50:56,225 --> 01:50:57,432
May I?

1033
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:03,516
I didn't know who you were with...

1034
01:51:03,850 --> 01:51:06,391
where you were.

1035
01:51:06,683 --> 01:51:09,599
No one knew where you'd got to...

1036
01:51:10,483 --> 01:51:11,703
It's not done.

1037
01:51:11,783 --> 01:51:15,612
Don't ever do that again, Colombina.
I didn't even know you'd gone out.

1038
01:51:15,692 --> 01:51:18,978
It took you ages to get back,
I was so worried.

1039
01:51:24,542 --> 01:51:26,416
He followed me here.

1040
01:51:29,292 --> 01:51:30,916
You found us.

1041
01:51:34,250 --> 01:51:35,930
What have you done?

1042
01:51:36,583 --> 01:51:39,666
It's all changed. It's beautiful.

1043
01:51:42,292 --> 01:51:45,181
- We're squatting in the station.
- Yes.

1044
01:51:45,917 --> 01:51:49,295
- We've worked hard on it, eh?
- There's still a lot to do.

1045
01:51:49,375 --> 01:51:53,161
- If you want to help...
- It didn't belong to anyone.

1046
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:55,250
Or it belonged to everyone.

1047
01:51:55,458 --> 01:51:58,166
It's only a temporary setup.

1048
01:51:59,042 --> 01:52:00,894
Life itself is temporary.

1049
01:52:03,958 --> 01:52:05,380
- Fabiana?
- Yes.

1050
01:52:05,583 --> 01:52:07,263
She lives here too.

1051
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,582
Look who's here!

1052
01:52:10,083 --> 01:52:11,083
H

1053
01:52:11,458 --> 01:52:13,837
Who'll give me a hand
to empty the car?

1054
01:52:13,917 --> 01:52:16,416
- I will...
- Let's go, kids.

1055
01:52:16,750 --> 01:52:18,430
- Hurry up.
- Let's go.

1056
01:52:19,208 --> 01:52:21,166
What have you bought?

1057
01:52:22,625 --> 01:52:26,054
- Let's unload the car.
- Did you get everything?

1058
01:52:26,208 --> 01:52:28,712
Hope we have some crisps and popcorn.

1059
01:52:28,792 --> 01:52:32,503
Just popcorn, if you're good
when I put the treatment on.

1060
01:52:32,583 --> 01:52:35,332
They'ye all got lice. So be careful.

1061
01:52:55,083 --> 01:52:57,545
Come here,
I'll put the concoction on you.

1062
01:52:57,625 --> 01:53:00,366
- No, Fabiana.
- You'll have lice too.

1063
01:53:15,042 --> 01:53:17,128
- Did it drip in your eyes?
- No.

1064
01:53:17,208 --> 01:53:19,208
I'd had enough of them too.

1065
01:53:19,458 --> 01:53:23,874
Always in charge, giving me orders.
But where did you get to?

1066
01:53:24,167 --> 01:53:25,374
Excuse me.

1067
01:53:26,208 --> 01:53:27,624
I was thinking.

1068
01:53:29,833 --> 01:53:32,277
Maybe Arthur could stay here too?

1069
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,624
- Me?
- Yes.

1070
01:53:35,167 --> 01:53:38,191
- For how long?
- A while...

1071
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Are you any good with kids?

1072
01:53:41,167 --> 01:53:43,912
He can babysit
when we're out at work.

1073
01:53:43,992 --> 01:53:47,491
- Or fix the electrics.
- Or change the windows.

1074
01:53:47,625 --> 01:53:51,128
- He could clean the bathroom.
- We needed a cleaning man.

1075
01:53:51,208 --> 01:53:54,280
- Can you cook? Make meat sauce?
- Pancakes?

1076
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:56,628
- I need a massage
- You're all crazy.

1077
01:53:56,708 --> 01:53:58,412
Will you be our servant?

1078
01:53:58,492 --> 01:54:01,791
Bring us breakfast in bed
every morning?

1079
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,170
I've found one.

1080
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:09,679
- I've found a head louse.
- I don't believe you.

1081
01:54:13,542 --> 01:54:15,616
Come on, let's rinse it off!

1082
01:54:32,292 --> 01:54:33,332
No, no.

1083
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,249
The servant.

1084
01:54:54,750 --> 01:54:56,416
What do you want?

1085
01:54:57,542 --> 01:54:58,874
Nothing.

1086
01:55:02,333 --> 01:55:04,207
don't care, go away.

1087
01:55:09,042 --> 01:55:10,457
What a bore...

1088
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:16,457
Come here.

1089
01:55:35,417 --> 01:55:37,499
Me and you.

1090
01:55:38,542 --> 01:55:40,874
we have a secret liaison.

1091
01:55:42,417 --> 01:55:43,624
Yes.

1092
01:59:25,083 --> 01:59:26,291
No luck.

1093
01:59:29,167 --> 01:59:33,167
- Are you tired, Arthur?
- Are you tired already, mister?

1094
01:59:33,583 --> 01:59:35,263
There's nothing here.

1095
01:59:35,875 --> 01:59:40,447
What do you mean? Spartaco told us
you're an expert in the field.

1096
01:59:40,583 --> 01:59:43,045
She says you're good
with this divining rod.

1097
01:59:43,125 --> 01:59:46,253
I'll take you to talk to this guy...
Come on.

1098
01:59:46,333 --> 01:59:48,462
- Hey, whatshisname!
- Come on...

1099
01:59:48,542 --> 01:59:50,545
I'm talking to you! Hurry up!

1100
01:59:50,625 --> 01:59:52,791
Rospo, go and get him.

1101
01:59:53,375 --> 01:59:55,597
- Is he dead?
- No, he's alive.

1102
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,291
Come here.

1103
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Come on! We won't hurt you.

1104
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:05,350
Come on. Help him.

1105
02:00:06,125 --> 02:00:07,636
Is this your dog?

1106
02:00:12,167 --> 02:00:14,128
- What's in your pocket?
- Show us.

1107
02:00:14,208 --> 02:00:16,170
No one's going to steal it.

1108
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:17,957
- Show us!
- Come on!

1109
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,124
It's gold.

1110
02:00:27,375 --> 02:00:28,503
Pure gold, see?

1111
02:00:28,583 --> 02:00:31,245
- It's a golden sun!
- Tell him where you found it.

1112
02:00:31,325 --> 02:00:32,805
Where did you find it?

1113
02:00:41,958 --> 02:00:43,253
What's he saying?

1114
02:00:43,333 --> 02:00:46,291
Are you capable of finding
these suns?

1115
02:01:11,958 --> 02:01:13,041
Here.

1116
02:01:42,375 --> 02:01:43,832
I see something!

1117
02:01:44,125 --> 02:01:46,644
There's something there, a tunnel.

1118
02:01:58,167 --> 02:01:59,167
Arthur?

1119
02:02:00,042 --> 02:02:01,642
Arthur, come here.

1120
02:02:08,333 --> 02:02:11,082
Come here, Arthur. Jump in.

1121
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,370
- Jump inside, Arthur.
- Jump in.

1122
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:17,593
- Why me?
- You get the honour, you found it.

1123
02:02:17,750 --> 02:02:19,602
That's how it works here.

1124
02:02:19,792 --> 02:02:21,041
Go ahead.

1125
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:27,250
Jump in.

1126
02:02:27,750 --> 02:02:30,680
- Tell us what's down there.
- Be careful.

1127
02:03:08,292 --> 02:03:09,457
Arthur!

1128
02:03:10,625 --> 02:03:11,666
Arthur!

1129
02:11:06,292 --> 02:11:08,666
THE CHIMERA
