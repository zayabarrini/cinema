Subject: Exploring Collaborative Opportunities in Cinema Production and Psychoanalysis

Dear [Cinema Production Company Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Zaya Barrini, and I am a passionate advocate of the intersections between cinema, psychoanalysis, and digital art. I am writing to explore potential collaboration opportunities within your esteemed production company.

I am deeply involved in exploring the creative narratives of cinema, particularly through the lens of psychoanalysis and philosophical thought. My work spans several areas, including cinema design, editing, video marketing, and recruitment, with a focus on the exploration of desire, the gaze, and the unconscious in cinema. My recent writings, such as Melancholic Machines and other ebooks, delve into these themes, as do my blog posts on various aspects of the cinematic world, including film production, psychoanalysis, and the structure of tragedy.

I hold a background in Computer Engineering from ITA and have extensive experience in software development and AIs, all of which inform my creative approach. My studies also include a deep interest in medical neuroscience, vision, and philosophy, which influence my work in cinema.

My work in psychoanalysis is shaped by the clinic and theoretical studies, where I have explored transference, the place of the unconscious, and the function of the Other within the clinic. My approach is rooted in Lacanian theory, particularly its implications for subjectivity, desire, and the structures of discourse. I have also studied the intersections of psychoanalysis with literature, capitalism, social bonds, and the forms of enjoyment (jouissance) that shape contemporary life.

Beyond clinical experience, I have been invested in teaching and developing courses on cinema/psychoanalysis, bringing together conceptual rigor and creative engagement. My courses and writings explore fundamental psychoanalytic concepts—symptom, anguish, aggressiveness—while also addressing their manifestations in culture, cinema, and digital spaces. I see teaching as an extension of the analytic field, offering spaces for new questions and subjective shifts to emerge.

I believe there is a unique opportunity for us to collaborate, merging my perspective on the psychological dimensions of film with your production expertise. I would love to discuss how we can potentially work together to create thought-provoking and innovative cinematic experiences.

I look forward to the possibility of collaborating and sharing ideas with you.

Best regards,
Zaya Barrini

Subject: Psychoanalysis, Language, and the Topology of Desire – Exploring Collaborative Possibilities

Dear [Lacanian Psychoanalyst School/Institute Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Zaya Barrini Oliveira Faria, and I am reaching out to explore potential collaborations with your institution, particularly in areas where psychoanalysis intersects with language, topology, and cultural production.

My work is grounded in a Lacanian perspective on language as the structuring force of the unconscious. I am particularly interested in the relationship between linguistic structures and the subject’s position within discourse—how the symbolic order shapes desire, symptom, and the field of the Other. This interest extends to the study of languages and their grammatical systems, which offers a unique vantage point to approach the multiplicity of the unconscious and the ways it is articulated across different cultural and linguistic frames.

I engage with a broad spectrum of languages—from my mothertongue Portuguese to advanced fluency in English and Spanish, and ongoing studies in French, German, Chinese, Russian, and others. My approach to language learning reflects a psychoanalytic sensitivity to the gaps and slips inherent in speech, while also drawing from linguistics and typology to explore syntactic structures, grammatical categories, and the effects of linguistic difference on subjectivity. I am particularly fascinated by the typology of languages across families such as Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, and Afro-Asiatic, and how variations in case systems, verb conjugations, and gender categories reveal the structural and symbolic dimensions of speech.

This inquiry into language is intertwined with my work on Klein’s bottle topology—a key concept in Lacan’s RSI (Real, Symbolic, Imaginary) framework. I am particularly drawn to how this structure articulates the continuous yet non-orientable relation between inside and outside, reflecting the paradoxes of subjectivity and the relation to the object of desire. My ongoing research explores how the topological models of the Möbius strip, the torus, and the Klein bottle offer a rigorous framework to think through clinical phenomena, particularly in cases where the symbolic fails to contain the Real.

These interests also extend to international cinema, where I examine how psychoanalytic concepts such as the gaze, fantasy, and identification are inscribed within visual and narrative forms. I closely follow global cinematic movements—from Oscar contenders and local cinema awards to films addressing themes of sexuality, melancholy, and childhood. Through this work, I explore how cinema stages the fundamental questions of subjectivity and the Real, particularly in films that engage with themes of language, identity, and the limits of representation.

I am eager to explore ways to contribute to your institution—whether through teaching, research collaborations, or discussions on how psychoanalysis engages with contemporary cultural and linguistic issues. I believe that the combination of psychoanalytic theory, linguistics, and topology offers a productive space to think through the complexities of the speaking subject today.

I look forward to hearing from you and hope to explore ways to collaborate.

Warm regards,

Subject: Exploring Psychoanalytic and Linguistic Intersections – A Collaborative Inquiry

Dear [Lacanian Psychoanalyst School/Institute Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Zaya Barrini Oliveira Faria, and I am writing to explore the possibility of collaboration with your esteemed institution, particularly at the intersections of psychoanalysis, language, and creative inquiry.

My interest in psychoanalysis has always been accompanied by a profound curiosity about languages and their structures. I believe that, much like the topology of the unconscious, language reveals its own Möbius strips—continuous surfaces where meaning turns back on itself. This fascination has led me to engage with multiple languages, both living and classical, as a way of approaching the gaps, displacements, and jouissance inherent to linguistic experience.

I speak Portuguese as my mother tongue and am fluent in English and Spanish, with intermediate proficiency in French/German, and foundational knowledge of Chinese, Russian, and Italian. I also study the structural nuances of languages such as Korean, Greek, Turkish, Polish, and Latin, while exploring alphabets like Hebrew, Arabic, and Hindi. Through this process, I am drawn not only to the communicative function of language but also to its topology—how signifiers circulate, slip, and return, much like the structure of the Klein bottle, where inside and outside collapse into a single surface.

In my daily practice, I engage with linguistic learning through writing, reading, speaking, and listening, using resources such as Duolingo, Falou, Calibre for translations, and conversation-based grammar tools. I also explore linguistic typology—examining word order, case systems, verb conjugation, and grammatical categories across language families such as Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, and Afro-Asiatic. I see this study as resonant with the Lacanian idea that language is not a transparent medium but a structure that shapes desire, subjectivity, and the real.

This intersection of language and psychoanalysis also informs my engagement with international cinema. I am particularly drawn to films that explore themes of melancholy, childhood, and desire—cinema that operates as a screen for the unconscious. I follow global cinematic currents, including Oscar selections, local cinema awards, and platforms like MUBI, where language, culture, and narrative form a textured, polyphonic dialogue.

I would love to explore how my background in psychoanalysis, linguistics, and cinema might contribute to your institution, whether through teaching, research, clinical supervision, or creative projects. I believe that a psychoanalytic school, much like a language, is a living structure—one that requires constant re-articulation and openness to new forms of discourse and desire.

You can find more about my work on my personal page on Psychoanalysis and Cinema and my Linktree page, where I share my courses, articles, and ongoing projects.

I look forward to the possibility of discussing our shared interests further.
