# How to reserve public spaces for filming locations 

Reserving a public space for filming is a mix of **permits, negotiation, and logistics**—and the exact process changes depending on the city and country. Here’s a clear breakdown so you can navigate it without accidentally being chased off by a park ranger mid-take.

## **1. Identify the Jurisdiction**

Before you do anything else, figure out **who owns and manages the location**:

* **City streets, sidewalks, public squares** → City’s Film Office or Permits Department.
* **Parks** → Parks and Recreation Department (or equivalent).
* **Beaches, forests** → State/Provincial or National Parks authority.
* **Historic sites** → Heritage or Cultural Affairs Department.
* **Transportation hubs** → Transit Authority, Airport Authority, Rail Company.

## **2. Contact the Right Office**

Look up the **Film Commission** or **Location Services Office** in your city.

* Many big cities have a dedicated **Film Office** (e.g., NYC Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment).
* Smaller towns may handle it via the **City Clerk** or **Events Office**.

**Tip:** In some countries (e.g., France, Canada, Australia), the **local municipality and the police** must both approve street filming.

## **3. Prepare Your Application**

Most permit offices will ask for:

* **Dates & times** of filming.
* **Exact location(s)** and map/diagram of where equipment, crew, and vehicles will be placed.
* **Number of cast/crew** on site.
* **Description of the scene** (especially if it involves weapons, stunts, loud noise, or simulated crimes).
* **Insurance** (general liability—commonly USD \$1M coverage).
* **Traffic or pedestrian control plans** if relevant.
* **COVID or safety compliance plan** (in some regions still required).

## **4. Expect Costs**

Fees vary by city:

* **Permit fee** – flat rate or per day.
* **Location rental** – some public spaces have separate rental fees.
* **Staffing fees** – for police, traffic controllers, or park rangers.
* **Deposit/bond** – refundable if the site is left clean and undamaged.

## **5. Timelines**

* Small shoots: **1–2 weeks** in advance.
* Large shoots (street closures, stunts, drones): **4–6+ weeks** in advance.
* Popular tourist sites may require **months** of lead time.

---

## **6. On the Day**

* Keep a printed **copy of the permit** at all times.
* Have a **location manager** to liaise with officials and handle issues.
* Follow all noise, safety, and public access rules.
* Restore the space to its original condition.

### **Pro Tips for Easier Approvals**

* **Build relationships** with film offices—they can recommend less crowded spaces and smooth approvals.
* If shooting in **multiple spots**, apply for a “multi-location permit” when available.
* For low-budget or student projects, mention it—many cities offer **fee waivers or discounts**.
* Always **notify nearby businesses and residents** before filming; complaints can shut you down even with a permit.
