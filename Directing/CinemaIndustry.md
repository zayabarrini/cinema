You: 

where do you get these financial data for cinema

ChatGPT: 

Financial data for films, such as production costs and worldwide grosses, typically come from a variety of sources, including:

### 1\. **Industry Databases**

-   **Box Office Mojo**: Tracks box office grosses for movies worldwide.
    
-   **The Numbers**: Offers detailed financial data on films, including production budgets and revenue.
    
-   **IMDb Pro**: Provides information about budgets, distributors, and earnings for registered users.
    

### 2\. **Trade Publications**

-   **Variety**, **Hollywood Reporter**, and **Deadline** frequently report on production budgets and earnings.
    
-   **Screen International** for global box office trends and production details.
    

### 3\. **Public Filings & Investor Reports**

-   Major studios (like Disney, Warner Bros., or Netflix) sometimes include production costs and revenue breakdowns in their quarterly or annual reports.
    

### 4\. **Press Releases and Interviews**

-   Studios or filmmakers occasionally disclose budgets during press tours or official announcements.
    

### 5\. **Film Festivals & Market Listings**

-   Production budgets are often revealed during film markets like Cannes or Sundance to attract distributors and investors.
    

### 6\. **Academic Research & Books**

-   For older films or independent productions, data may come from biographies, academic papers, or books about filmmaking.
    

### Caveats

-   Financial data for films can be inconsistent or unavailable for smaller or independent productions, especially if their budgets and revenues aren't widely publicized.
    
-   Figures for production costs might not include marketing and distribution expenses, which can significantly impact profitability.

Breakdown how much a director earning 10% of the profits would make in a movie

ChatGPT: 

Let’s break down how much a director earning 10% of a movie's profits would make. Here's the process:

### Step 1: **Define Profits**

Profits = **Worldwide Gross Revenue** - **Total Costs**

-   **Worldwide Gross Revenue**: Box office earnings worldwide.
    
-   **Total Costs**: Include **production costs** and **marketing/distribution costs** (often 50%-100% of production costs).
    

### Step 2: **Example Scenario**

Let’s calculate for a movie with the following financials:

-   **Worldwide Gross Revenue**: $100 million
    
-   **Production Cost**: $30 million
    
-   **Marketing & Distribution Cost**: $20 million
    

**Total Costs** = $30M + $20M = **$50M**  
**Profits** = $100M - $50M = **$50M**

### Step 3: **Director’s Earnings (10% of Profits)**

-   10% of $50M = **$5M**
    

### Notes and Considerations

1.  **Profit Participation Timing**
    
    -   The director is usually paid after costs are fully recouped ("net profits").
        
    -   Many contracts also specify backend deals that include only theatrical releases, excluding streaming or other revenues.
        
2.  **Profit Definitions Vary**
    
    -   Some studios define profits in a way that minimizes payouts (e.g., "Hollywood accounting"). This may reduce the director’s share.
        
3.  **Directors Often Have Other Earnings**
    
    -   Directors typically have an upfront fee (e.g., $5-$20M for big names, or lower for indie films). This fee is separate from profit participation.
        

### Custom Calculation

If you provide the movie’s gross revenue, costs, or specifics, I can calculate an accurate breakdown for a different scenario!

You: 

Give the Director's profit considering 10% for the movie list asked above

ChatGPT: 

Let’s calculate the **director’s profit (10%)** for each movie in your list, based on the formula:

**Director’s Earnings = 10% × (Worldwide Gross - Total Costs)**

For simplicity, we'll use the **production costs** from earlier as a base and assume **marketing costs = 50% of production costs**, unless otherwise specified.

### Observations:

-   **Profitable Movies**: Films like *Parasite*, *Call Me by Your Name*, and *Manchester by the Sea* provide substantial director payouts.
    
-   **Loss-Making Movies**: Many indie or niche films don’t generate profits, leaving the director with no backend earnings.

Breakdown the worldwide gross constitution

ChatGPT: 

The **worldwide gross** for a film is composed of revenue from various sources across different markets. Here’s a breakdown of its constitution:

---

### 1\. **Box Office Revenue**

-   **Domestic Box Office (North America):**  
    Revenue from theaters in the U.S. and Canada. Typically accounts for **30-50%** of the worldwide gross for Hollywood films, though it can vary.
    
-   **International Box Office:**  
    Revenue from theaters outside North America. This often makes up **50-70%** of the worldwide gross, with major markets like China, the UK, South Korea, and India contributing significantly.
    

---

### 2\. **Ancillary Revenue Streams**

These are post-theatrical revenue sources that contribute to the worldwide gross but are often not included in box office figures.

-   **Streaming and Digital Sales:**  
    Revenue from platforms like Netflix, Amazon, or Apple TV, through licensing fees or sales.
    
-   **Physical Media (DVD/Blu-ray):**  
    Includes sales and rentals of DVDs and Blu-ray discs. This segment has declined in recent years.
    
-   **Television Rights:**  
    Licensing fees for broadcasting the film on TV networks (both cable and free-to-air).
    
-   **Merchandising and Licensing:**  
    Revenue from selling branded merchandise (toys, clothing, etc.), primarily for family films or blockbusters.
    

---

### 3\. **Market-Specific Variations**

-   **China:**  
    The Chinese government typically allows foreign films to retain only **25% of box office revenue** due to local regulations.
    
-   **Europe:**  
    Distributors often retain a significant portion of ticket sales (~50%), leaving a smaller share for producers.
    

---

### 4\. **Gross vs. Net Revenue**

-   **Gross Revenue:** Total ticket sales worldwide (before deductions).
    
-   **Net Revenue:** Revenue after deducting exhibitor fees, distributor fees, and other costs. This is often much smaller than the gross.
    

---

### Typical Division of Box Office Revenue:

1.  **Exhibitors (Theaters):** Retain **40-50%** of box office revenue.
    
2.  **Distributors:** Take **10-20%** as their fee.
    
3.  **Producers/Investors:** Receive the remaining **30-50%** as their share.
    

---

### Example Breakdown for a Film with $100M Worldwide Gross:

| **Source** | **Revenue** (Approx.) |
| --- | --- |
| Domestic Box Office | $40M (40%) |
| International Box Office | $60M (60%) |
| Streaming/Digital Sales | $20M (not in box office) |
| Merchandising/Licensing | $5M (not in box office) |
| Television Rights | $10M (not in box office) |

From the $100M gross, actual revenue to the producer might only be **$30-40M** after deductions.

Breakdown domestic box Office

ChatGPT: 

The **domestic box office** (typically U.S. and Canada) is the revenue earned from ticket sales in theaters. Here’s how it breaks down:

---

### 1\. **Ticket Revenue Split**

-   **Exhibitors (Theaters):** Retain **40-60%** of the ticket sales.
    
    -   Larger chains (AMC, Regal, etc.) may negotiate higher percentages in their favor, especially after the opening weekend.
        
    -   Independent theaters might retain a slightly smaller share.
        
-   **Distributors/Studios:** Receive the remaining **40-60%**, depending on the deal.
    
    -   Studios often keep a higher share during the opening weeks and a smaller share as the film's run continues.
        

---

### 2\. **Taxes and Fees**

-   **Sales Tax:** A small portion (varies by state) is deducted before revenue is split. This does not directly affect the exhibitor-studio split but impacts total gross.
    

---

### 3\. **Weekend Dynamics**

-   **Opening Weekend:** Studios usually take a larger share (~70-80%) during this critical period, as these earnings are crucial to recoup costs.
    
-   **Subsequent Weeks:** As the film stays in theaters, the exhibitor's share gradually increases (up to 60% by the end of the run).
    

---

### Example Breakdown (Domestic Box Office Gross = $100M):

| **Category** | **Share** | **Amount** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Exhibitors (Theaters)** | 50% (average split) | $50M |
| **Distributors (Studio)** | 50% (average split) | $50M |

---

### 4\. **Studio Share Breakdown**

From the distributor's share, the studio uses the revenue to:

-   **Recoup Production Costs:** To cover the initial budget.
    
-   **Cover Marketing Costs:** A significant portion goes here (can be equal to the production budget).
    
-   **Pay Profit Participants:** Directors, actors, or producers with backend deals.
    
-   **Investors/Financiers:** Return on investment if external financing is involved.
    

---

### Realistic Scenarios

For films with **$100M domestic gross**:

1.  **Blockbusters (High Negotiation Power):**  
    Studios might secure **60-65%** of opening weekend gross, maximizing early returns.
    
2.  **Independent Films (Lower Negotiation Power):**  
    Theaters might retain **55-60%**, leaving studios with less.

    -   Russia contributes significantly to screen count and admissions.
        
4.  **Latin America**:
    
    -   Admissions are driven by major markets like Mexico and Brazil, but economic challenges keep revenues relatively modest.

A movie incurs **economic losses** when its total costs exceed its total revenue. Here's a detailed breakdown of the factors and scenarios contributing to this:

---

### **1\. Total Costs of a Movie**

#### **a. Production Costs**

-   **Above-the-Line (ATL):** Salaries for key talent (director, lead actors, screenwriter, producer).
    
-   **Below-the-Line (BTL):** Costs for crew, sets, costumes, special effects, post-production, etc.
    
-   **Other Costs:** Reshoots, delays, or unforeseen expenses.
    

#### **b. Marketing and Distribution Costs**

-   Often equal to or greater than production costs.
    
-   Includes advertising (trailers, posters, TV spots, social media), promotional tours, and distribution logistics (DCPs, hard drives).
    

#### **c. Exhibitor Share**

-   Theaters retain 40-60% of the box office revenue.
    

#### **d. Financing Costs**

-   Interest on loans or advances used to fund production and distribution.
    

#### **e. Backend Deals**

-   Profit-sharing agreements with actors, directors, or other stakeholders.
    

---

### **2\. Revenue Sources**

#### **a. Box Office Revenue**

-   **Domestic Gross:** U.S. and Canada (high ticket prices, critical for Hollywood).
    
-   **International Gross:** Often larger than domestic, especially for blockbusters.
    

#### **b. Ancillary Revenue**

-   Streaming (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.).
    
-   Home entertainment (DVD/Blu-ray sales, rentals).
    
-   TV rights (cable, network, international syndication).
    
-   Merchandise and licensing (for franchises).
    

---

### **3\. Common Scenarios Leading to Economic Losses**

#### **a. Low Box Office Performance**

-   A film fails to attract audiences due to poor marketing, bad reviews, or competition.
    
-   Examples: **"The Last Duel" (2021)** underperformed due to weak marketing and pandemic-related hesitancy.
    

#### **b. High Production Costs**

-   Overly inflated budgets due to mismanagement, expensive VFX, or high salaries.
    
-   Example: **"John Carter" (2012)** cost $250M to produce but only grossed $284M globally.
    

#### **c. Overestimated Marketing ROI**

-   Marketing fails to generate expected audience interest.
    
-   Example: Excessive advertising for a niche film that appeals to a small audience.
    

#### **d. Poor International Performance**

-   Films may perform well domestically but fail internationally.
    
-   Cultural disconnects or lack of localization efforts are common issues.
    

#### **e. Short Theatrical Window**

-   Limited theater runs due to competition or lack of audience interest.
    
-   Example: Films pulled early to reduce exhibitor costs but lose box office potential.
    

#### **f. Weak Ancillary Revenue**

-   Limited streaming or TV rights sales, low merchandise potential, or outdated licensing deals.
    

#### **g. Unrealistic Profit Expectations**

-   Studios may overestimate a film's potential based on trends rather than actual market research.
    

---

### **4\. Case Study: Example Loss Calculation**

**Hypothetical Film:**

-   **Production Budget:** $100M
    
-   **Marketing Costs:** $50M
    
-   **Total Cost:** $150M
    
-   **Worldwide Gross:** $200M
    
-   **Exhibitor Share:** 50% of gross = $100M retained by theaters
    
-   **Studio Revenue:** $100M
    
-   **Net Loss:** $150M (cost) - $100M (studio revenue) = **\-$50M**
    

---

### **5\. Mitigating Factors for Losses**

-   **Tax Incentives:** Filming in locations with tax breaks reduces costs.
    
-   **Pre-Sales:** Selling distribution rights upfront (common in Europe and Asia).
    
-   **Streaming Deals:** Platforms like Netflix may cover production costs for exclusivity.
    
-   **Franchise Value:** Losses on a single film may be recouped by sequels or merchandise (e.g., **"The LEGO Movie 2"**).

How do directors create scenes of violence involving animals

ChatGPT: 

Directors creating scenes of violence involving animals typically employ a combination of techniques to ensure the safety of animals, actors, and crew, while achieving the desired effect on screen. These methods include:

### 1\. **Use of Animatronics or CGI**

-   **Animatronics**: Life-sized, realistic robotic animals are often used to simulate violent scenes. These can be programmed for specific movements, avoiding harm to real animals.
    
-   **Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI)**: Digital effects allow filmmakers to create entirely realistic animals and violent interactions without involving real creatures.
    

### 2\. **Trained Animals**

-   When real animals are used, they are professionally trained to perform specific actions safely. The scenes are carefully choreographed to ensure no harm comes to the animal.
    
-   Trainers are always present on set to guide the animal and oversee their welfare.
    

### 3\. **Editing and Camera Angles**

-   Filmmakers often rely on creative editing and camera angles to give the illusion of violence. For instance, the act may be implied rather than shown explicitly.
    
-   Quick cuts, close-ups, and sound effects enhance the sense of action without requiring actual physical interaction.
    

### 4\. **Use of Props and Stunt Doubles**

-   Props such as stuffed animals, fake limbs, or rubber replicas may be used for close-up or violent sequences.
    
-   In some cases, animal stunt doubles are used, with safety measures in place to minimize any risk.
    

### 5\. **Regulations and Guidelines**

-   In many countries, organizations like the **American Humane Association (AHA)** ensure that no animals are harmed during production. The "No Animals Were Harmed" certification is given to films that comply with their guidelines.
    
-   Local animal welfare laws are adhered to, and representatives may be present on set to monitor compliance.
    

### 6\. **Practical Effects**

-   Blood, wounds, and injuries are simulated using practical effects like makeup, prosthetics, and fake blood. These elements are applied to either real or fake animals to create the illusion of harm.
    

### 7\. **Stock Footage**

-   Pre-existing footage of animals in the wild or in controlled environments may be used to depict dangerous or violent situations.
    

### 8\. **Sound Design**

-   Realistic sound effects are often a critical component in creating the illusion of violence. Growls, yelps, or other animal sounds can add tension and realism to the scene.
    

### 9\. **Ethical Considerations**

-   Ethical filmmaking emphasizes storytelling without compromising the welfare of animals. Many filmmakers opt for entirely simulated or implied violence rather than involving real animals.
    

### Examples of Films with These Techniques:

-   **"Life of Pi"**: Used CGI and animatronics for scenes involving a tiger.
    
-   **"The Revenant"**: Combined CGI and practical effects for scenes involving a bear attack.
    
-   **"War Horse"**: Relied on highly trained horses, camera tricks, and animatronics.
    

By using these methods, filmmakers balance the ethical treatment of animals with the artistic demands of storytelling.

Compiling a detailed table that categorizes the number of films produced annually by budget scale for each of the specified countries—USA, Germany, Spain, France, Japan, China, South Korea, Brazil, Russia, and India—is challenging due to limited publicly available data. However, I can provide an overview of the total number of films produced annually in these countries, along with some insights into production budgets where available.

**Film Production by Country:**

**Insights on Production Budgets:**

Films produced with a budget under $1 million dropped in 2020 before bouncing back in 2021, exceeding pre-pandemic figures. [statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1386407/number-movies-produced-by-budget-us/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
-   **France:** Over the past decade, the number of movies produced in France has remained relatively stable, fluctuating just under the 300 mark annually.

[statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1228784/number-movies-production-france/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## 🧨 Critiques of the Oscar Voting System

| **Issue** | **Description** | **Examples / Impacts** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🎭 **Bias Toward Prestige Genres** | Heavy preference for dramas, biopics, war films, and period pieces. | Comedies, horror, and sci-fi often ignored. |
| 👴 **Lack of Diversity (Until Recently)** | Historically white, male, older membership skewed results. | #OscarsSoWhite (2015–16), lack of Black or queer recognition. |
| 🇺🇸 **Anglo-American Bias** | Non-English films rarely win top prizes unless there's major international buzz. | *Parasite* was the first non-English Best Picture (2020). |
| 🧾 **Overemphasis on Campaigning** | Studios spend millions lobbying voters, often outweighing merit. | *Shakespeare in Love* over *Saving Private Ryan* (1999) |
| 🔍 **Opaque Process** | Voting processes are not fully transparent, including committee decisions in some categories. | Controversy over *To Leslie* nomination (2023). |
| 🎥 **Favoring Established Names** | Newcomers often overlooked, while veterans are nominated for lesser work. | “Career Oscars” given late in life. |
| 📽 **Voting Without Viewing** | Some voters don't watch all eligible films. | Confirmed anonymously by multiple members to major outlets (e.g., The Hollywood Reporter, Variety). |

ChatGPT: 

Classify these performers from distance of the Symbolic: Manual workers, Singers, Actors, Directors, Businessman, Psychoanalysts, Mathematician, etc

You: 

Classifying performers or professionals by their **“distance from the Symbolic”**—in Lacanian terms—requires considering how directly their work engages with **language, structure, law, and symbolic authority** (the Symbolic Order), versus the **Imaginary (image, identification)** or **Real (what resists symbolization)**.

Here’s a **conceptual classification** from **closest to furthest** from the Symbolic, focusing on how each role operates within or against symbolic structures (e.g., language, systems, roles, law, discourse):

---

### 🔤 **Closer to the Symbolic**

| **Profession** | **Why** |
| --- | --- |
| **Mathematicians** | Operate in pure symbolic structures (abstract logic, formal language). |
| **Psychoanalysts** | Engage with the symbolic structuring of subjectivity (language, desire, Law-of-the-Father). |
| **Businessmen (High-level)** | Work with contracts, social law, exchange systems, and symbolic power (money as a signifier). |
| **Directors (Auteur)** | Create symbolic order within narrative, organize discourse, represent law/desire/Other. |
| **Actors (Theatrical)** | Embody symbolic roles (mother, king, judge), though also strongly Imaginary. |
| **Writers / Philosophers** | (Not listed but would be here) — explicit constructors of Symbolic systems. |

---

### 🪞 **Middle: Mediation Between Symbolic and Imaginary**

| **Profession** | **Why** |
| --- | --- |
| **Singers** | Use language and rhythm (Symbolic) but often embody jouissance and Imaginary image. |
| **Actors (Film / Pop culture)** | Subject to Imaginary identifications (celebrity, mirror stage), but scripted roles are Symbolic. |
| **Directors (Commercial)** | Mediate Symbolic (script) and Imaginary (market, visual pleasure). |

---

### 🧱 **Furthest from the Symbolic (Closer to the Imaginary/Real)**

| **Profession** | **Why** |
| --- | --- |
| **Manual Workers** | Their labor is physical/material (Real), structured by Symbolic law but often excluded from speaking within it. |
| **Pop Stars (not singer-songwriters)** | Often pure Imaginary surface, object of gaze, desire; alienated from Symbolic authorship. |
| **Marginalized Roles / Unregulated Work** | May operate outside Symbolic recognition, in Real (violence, invisibility). |

---

### 🧠 Notes on Lacanian Theory:

-   The **Symbolic**: realm of language, law, structure, social link, the Name-of-the-Father.
    
-   The **Imaginary**: identification, image, ego, mirror relations.
    
-   The **Real**: what resists symbolization—trauma, jouissance, bodily remainder.

-   Place yourself or others in this logic?

-   **Imaginary**: identity, image, seduction, ego ideal.
    
-   **Real**: rupture, unassimilable trauma, raw jouissance.

Absolutely — here's a **Lacanian analysis** of the key roles played by the listed Anglo actresses, identifying films where their **screen characters resonate with their Lacanian position** (as previously defined), and others that feel **disjointed** from their libidinal or symbolic coordinates — often due to narrative incoherence, overidentification with the Imaginary, or Symbolic flattening.

### 🧠 Notes:

-   **Structural matching** is based on **Lacanian coordinates**: the role of lack, the subject of desire, the Other, familial ties, repression, Real events, and Symbolic articulation.
    
-   Some entries (like **“La Haine”**, **“Shoplifters”**, or **“Pather Panchali”**) represent **cinematic shifts** where **class and ethics of care** enter the symbolic dramatically.
    
-   **Arabic cinema** sometimes has less globally visible output in these genres, but films like *Capernaum* and *Wadjda* open real symbolic questions.

## **1\. Identify the Jurisdiction**

-   **Transportation hubs** → Transit Authority, Airport Authority, Rail Company.
    

---

## **2\. Contact the Right Office**

Look up the **Film Commission** or **Location Services Office** in your city.

-   Many big cities have a dedicated **Film Office** (e.g., NYC Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment).
    
-   Smaller towns may handle it via the **City Clerk** or **Events Office**.
    

**Tip:** In some countries (e.g., France, Canada, Australia), the **local municipality and the police** must both approve street filming.

-   Large shoots (street closures, stunts, drones): **4–6+ weeks** in advance.
    
-   Popular tourist sites may require **months** of lead time.
    

---

## **6\. On the Day**

-   Have a **location manager** to liaise with officials and handle issues.
