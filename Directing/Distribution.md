**Insights on Production Budgets:**

* **United States:** In 2021, the number of movies entering production with a budget higher than \$15 million reached 226. Films produced with a budget under \$1 million dropped in 2020 before bouncing back in 2021, exceeding pre-pandemic figures. ([statista.com][1])
