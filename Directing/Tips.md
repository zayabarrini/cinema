Screenwriting Tips from Christopher Nolan
01
As a writer, I try to take my director's hat off and not be afraid, and just say, 'I want to write the most exciting thing, the most unexpected thing I can think of, for the story.' Every screenplay you want to be challenging yourself. You want to be doing something different."
02
"I don't actually tend to do a lot of research when I'm writing. I think what you want to do with research is just confirming things you want to do. If the research contradicts what you want to do, you tend to go ahead and do it anyway."
03
"Writing, for me, is a combination of objective and subjective approach. You take an objective approach at times to get you through things, and you take a subjective approach at other times, and that allows you to find an emotional experience for the audience."
04
"Everybody's situation is unique, and the one thing I've learned is that instead of copying someone else's model for a low-budget film, you really have to look at what you've got available and see how you can tell the story you want to tell, using the things that you have around you."
05
"One of the things you do as a writer and as a filmmaker is grasp for resonant symbols and imagery without necessarily fully understanding it yourself. You never quite know what you're going to come back to and figure out how to make it work."
06
07
08
09
10
"What I try to do is write from the inside out. I really try to jump into the world of the film and the characters, try to imagine myself in that world rather than imagining it as a film I'm watching onscreen."
"I try to be as efficient as possible because, in my process, I think that actually helps the work. I like having the pressure of time and money and really trying to stick to the parameters we've been given."
"It's about using things that audiences can relate and respond to that matters most, even if you don't fully understand them. You never quite know where that desire to finish something or return to something in a fresh way, is going to come from."
"You need time. And that doesn't mean necessarily even working full-time on it itself it means time to throw some ideas together and then let them sit, go off and do something else, come back and see what still feels right and everything."
"If you can get a little bit of attention, a little bit of success on the festival circuit, people say, 'Well, what would you want to do next?' And the tricky thing is, if you don't have a specific thing, you can't capitalize on that moment. Have your next thing ready to pitch."

Advice for Aspiring Filmmakers from the Greats
LAvideoFilmmaker.com
Steven Spielberg
"If you get bitten by that bug you can make a lot of little movies and somehow those films will get seen by people hopefully that will hire you to do a music video someday, or a TV commercial, or a television show or someday a feature film."
James Cameron
"Pick up a camera. Shoot something. No matter how small, no matter how cheesy, no matter whether your friends and your sister star in it. Put your name on it as director. Now you're a director. Everything after that you're just negotiating your budget and your fee."
Quentin Tarantino
"To this day I actually think that... rather than go to film school, just get a camera and try to start making a movie."
Stanley Kubrick
"...the best thing that young filmmakers should do is to get hold of a camera and some film and make a movie of any kind at all."

FIGHT SCENE CHEAT SHEET
Fight scenes can be gritty and realistic, or supernatural and fantastic. Which route you choose will depend on your characters, settings, and the overall tone of your story.
Fight Scenes Serve 3 Functions:
Improve Pacing 1.
2 Heap Trouble on Characters
3. Reader Satisfaction
4 Things Every Fight Scene Needs:
1. A cause
2. An opening salvo
3. An ebb and flow
4. A big finish
(And remember the "after-action report"!)
What's the purpose of the fight scene?
Will it move the story forward?
Will it reveal something about the character(s)?
Will it set up later events?
Or, is this the climactic scene in your novel?
Setting It Up:
1. High Stakes
2. Real Danger
3. An Emotional Wound
Remember, motives make the difference between senseless violence and heroism.
Learn the vocabulary of martial movement. Do your research!
UNDERSTANDING VIOLENCE
Real violence is not even remotely similar to how it is depicted in film and television. Believe it or not, violence follows rules, both social and physical. As a writer, you should know what these rules are so you can know whether or not you want to break them.
The 3 Types of Physical Conflict:
1. Social aggression
2. Asocial violence
3. Waging war
(#2 & #3 = Pros... and pros don't screw around)
The Immutable Laws of Real-Life Combat:
1. DISTANCE: Proximity negates skill.
2 SIZE and NUMBERS: They matter, a lot!
3. SPEED: Get there first with the most.
4. TIMING: Intercept and don't get hit.
5. ATTRITION: Getting hit has consequences.
6. SKILL: Skill differentials count
7. POSITIONING: Action beats inaction.
12. Animated movements
8. INTEL: Know your enemy.
9. STRATEGY: Strategy prevents stalemates.
10. WILL: Ferocity matters.
Pre-Attack Indicators:
1. Clenched jaw
2. Clenching fists
3. Grooming
4. Blading the body
5. Looking away/head tum
6. Posturing ("bowing up")
7. Eyes glaze over
8. Nostrils flare
9. Sweating
10. Eyes widen/Pupils dilate
11. Initial contact (poking, prodding, and shoving)
13. Pacing
14. Scanning the area
15. Repeatedly glancing at targets
Rules matter because they create consistency, increase believability, and provide a rationale for fight outcomes.
How can fights be "won"?
1. Outsmart opponent
2. Out-skill opponent
3. Out-grit opponent
4. Physically overpower opponent
5. Luck (beware deus ex machina!)
Making Fights Believable...
1. No one escapes unscathed
2. Pyrrhic victories
3. GRRM it
4. Research!
5. Respect the line between cool and silly

14 TIPS FROM STEPHEN KING'S ON WRITING
1. If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot
Stories consist 2. of three parts:
Narration: which moves the story from point a to point B Description: which creates a sensory reality for the reader
Dialogue: which brings characters to life through their speech
3. THE SITUATION COMES FIRST. THE CHARACTERS ALWAYS FLAT AND UNFEATURED, TO BEGIN WITH СОЛЕ НЕХТ
5. THE MOST INTERESTING SITUATIONS CAN USUALLY BE EXPRESSED AS A WHAT-IF QUESTION
4. Whether it's a vignette of a single page or an epic trilogy like The Lord of the Rings, the work is always accomplished one word at a time
1
6. The best stories always end up being about the people rather than the event
7. With a passive verb, something is being done to the subject of the sentence. The subject is just letting it happen. You should avoid the passive tense The meeting will be held The body was carried
9. Description begins in the writer's imagination, but should finish in the reader's
11. NEVER USE 'EMOLUMENT WHEN YOU МЕАИ 'ТІР'
THESAURUS
8. Talk, whether ugly or beautiful, is an index of character
10. LOUDLY NASTILY The road to hell is paved with adverbs SLOWLY KINDLY
SOFTLY 0
12. Set a daily writing goal. As with physical exercise, it would be best to set this goal low at first. I suggest a thousand words a day
13. Call that one person you write for Ideal Reader. He or she is going to be in your writing room all the time
14. If you can do it for joy, you can do it for ever

5 SIMPLE STEPS ON
HOW TO BE A BETTER SCREENWRITER
Don't just work hard, work smart.
1 PRACTICE DISCIPLINE
Set aside time to write. Finish what you start. Write even when you don't "feel" like it.
2 WRITE EVERY DAY
Build a writing routine. Make it so familiar that it's a part of your day, like showering or brushing your teeth.
3 SHOW DON'T TELL
Paint a visual picture. Reveal character insight through action.
4 OUTLINE STRUCTU
Know the beginning, middl and end of your story. Find active ways for your chara to reach their goal by mapping out the story.
5 KNOW THE MARKET
Read entertainment industry trades. Read spec scripts that sell. Be aware of the industry climate.

FIRST ACT TIMELINE
(set-up)
1%-12%
Readers learn about your characters, their goals, and the stakes.
(build-up)
12%-25%
The final pieces necessary for the main conflict are moved into position, while ramping up the tension.
HOOK
1% mark
This opening moment is your opening scene-the first thing that happens in your story-possibly even the first line.
INCITING EVENT
12% mark
A turning point occurs halfway through the First Act. This is the Call to Adventure, the moment the Normal World is first significantly rocked by the conflict.
1ST PLOT POINT
25% mark
The doorway between the end of the First Act and the beginning of the Second. Also likely to be the Key Event.

THE EIGHT POINT STORY ARC
4. THE SURPRISE
This solidifies the conflict and character development. It can be used to make the protagonist commit fully to the story, or alternatively can be used to question their role in the quest.
3. THE QUEST
This is the main bulk of the screenplay and generally involves the protagonist pursuing a need. This is the journey. It's the fulfillment of your story's logline.
2. TRIGGER
What goes wrong? Many call this the inciting incident. What changes in the characters lives to set them off on...
1. STASIS
When we meet our characters their lives are usually average. Show us how they see the world and how the world sees them. Everything is peaceful until
5. CRITICAL CHOICE
What happens when faced with the greatest obstacle? Does your character fight back or shy away? This is commonly known as the low point or "dark night of the soul" in the Blake Snyder beat sheet.
6. CLIMAX
This is the ultimate test for a character's emotions and ability to arc. The situation is most dire for our characters. It occurs near end of the script and is the confluence of all the problems and conflicts that have been encountered before.
7. REVERSAL
This is a natural and eamed change in events based on the actions in the climax. Things begin to go our lead character's way for once. But you can also subvert this and have things get even worse
8. RESOLUTION
We find the equilibrium of the new world. How has the sum of these parts changed the people who went through them and the inhabitants of this world?

30 CINEMATOGRAPHY TECHNIQUES AND TIPS
1. THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX
Stanley Kubrick and his cinematographer, John Alcott set out to film a scene with candlelights. The result of this solution is nothing short of painterly. Finding the next great camera technique may just be a matter of devising a creative solution to achieve your visual goals.
2. MOTION IN THE FRAME
How you use your frame is critical. You want to keep things active and visually engaging. A director has a lot on a film set to manage. Strategize on where you can insert some cost effective camera movements that will help bring the project to life.
3. EXPERIMENT WITH LENS SIZES
Try slapping a wide lens on for a close up, or a long lens for an establishing shot. Of course you only want to do that if it works for the story you're telling. But experimenting never hurts. Don't ever be afraid to give something a look. Time permitting, of course.
4.THE RIGHT GEAR FOR THE JOB
Get familiar with ALL types of cameras and lenses. If and when the director asks for something out of the ordinary you'll need to be ready with not only suggestions, but also the requisite knowledge to implement them. Knowing how to achieve the same end goals will make you favorite of producers as well. Which likely means more jobs.
5. KNOW THE SCRIPT
Far too often camera crews and even DoP's don't know the script backwards and forwards. Being a cinematographer is as creative as it is technical. Make sure the ideas you bring to the table are grounded in a knowledge of the material. You're also a storytelling collaborator. Not just a gearhead.
6. MANAGE TIME WISELY
Use shot list software, and go over all the scheduling you can with the AD team. That means working with scheduling software and getting to know it's ins and outs. The crew will often look to you to move forward. Be prepared. Don't let them down,
7. MIXING COLOR TEMPERATURE
Colors pop more when they are laid alongside contrasting colors, and photographed properly. Some of this comes down to production design, but it's also where filmmaking techniques from other departments begin to co-mingle.

SMART CAREER

THIS IS MARKETING GEDIN
WHO IS IT FOR?
"The only productive solution is to find a a lock lock and then fashion a key.-not the other way around"
First you need to decide who you intend to change.
1008
MINIMUM VIABLE AUDIENCE
"Your work is not for everyone. It's only for those who signed up for the journey.
What is the minimum number of people you need to influence to be worth the effort?
1,000 FANS
It is more productive to be important to just a few people. Look for your thousand fans.
"If you can't succeed at something small, why do you believe you will succeed at something big?"
LOOK FOR NEOPHILIACS
"Don't waste a minute on someone who isn't on the right side of the curve. It's the neophiliacs you should focus on.
LOOKING FOR " "YOU"
"Be who people want to find when they search."
The goal is to have someone who cares enough about you and your product to type your name into Google, not a generic term.
Define your audience well and for the rest, just say: "NOT FOR YOU!"
WHAT IS THE CHANGE?
"People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill bit. They want to feel safe and respected."
We sell FEELINGS, STATUS AND CONNECTION, not tasks or stuff.
PROMISE
What is your promise? How will you help your audience change?
CREATE A TENSION
"If you don't create tension with your story and your you solution, the STATUS QUO will likely prevail.
The audience needs to be stimulated to appreciate the novelty. Is it something worth considering?
SEE AND LISTEN
"The people that we seek to serve are moved by thoughts and emotions different from yours."
STATUS
"The desire to change our status, or protect it, controls almost everything we do."
Some people fight for a change and others to keep their roles. What is your audience's narrative?
Understand your audience's desire and
FOCUS ON 1 CHANGE
TX
WHAT'S THE STORY?
"People LIKE US do things like this"
What is the STORY they will tell others?
INTERNAL NARRATIVES
"Everyone always acts according to their own internal narratives.
TRIBES
X
What differentiates who is inside the TRIBE?
Create signs and symbols that help define the boundaries of the tribe. Define "WE".
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SAY?
"People won't spread the word because it's important to you. They'll only do it because it's important to them. Because it brings them closer to their goals, because it allows them to tell themselves a story they're proud of."
What's the incentive to share?
NETWORK EFFECT
Neophiliacs' lives will be better if everyone in their network embraces this idea as well.
Make it easy. Think about the answer to "What am I going to tell my friends? Why am I going to tell them?"
Help the TRIBE tell the story to others and to THEMSELVES

PIXAR's 22 Rules of Storytelling
chicty Chea Sitios
#1: Admire characters for attempting more than what their successes have been.
#2. Keep in mind what's interesting to you asan audience, not what's fun to do as a wnter. They can be very different,
#3: Trying for theme is important, however you won't see what the story is about until you're at the end of that story, Got it? Now rewrite.
#4. Once upon a time there was One day Because of that, Because of that, Until finally Every day,
#5. Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You'll feel like you're losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.
#6: What is your character good at or comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at him. Challenge him. How does he deal with it?
#7: Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard. Get yours working up front
#8: Finish your story. Let go even if it's not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time.
#9: When you're stuck, make a list of what wouldn't happen next. More often than not, the material that gets you unstuck appears.
#10: Pull apart the stories you like, What you like in them is a part of you. Recognize it before you use it.
#11: Why must you tell this story in particular? What's the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That's the heart of it.
#12: Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th-get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself.
#13: Give your characters opinions. A character being passive or malleable is easy for you as a writer, but it's poison to your audience.
#14: What's the essence of your story? What's the most economical way of telling of it? If you know that, you can build out from there
#15: If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.
#16: What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if he doesn't succeed? Stack the odds against him.
#17: No work is ever wasted. And if it's not working, let go and move on if it's useful, it'll show up again.
#18: You have to know yourself, and know the difference between doing your best & being fussy. Story is testing, not refining.
#19: Coincidences that get characters into trouble are great. Coincidences that get them out of it is cheating
#20: Exercise. Take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How would you rearrange them into what you DO like?
#21: Identify with your situation/characters. Don't write "cool." What would make YOU act that way?
#22: Putting it on paper only allows you to start fixing it. If a perfect idea stays in your head, you'll never share it with anyone.

Shot Types
Long shots, medium shots, close-ups, and all of their variations convey different emotions, perspectives, and information.
Angles
Camera angles in relation to the subject play a significant role in how the audience perceives a scene.
Movement
Camera movement will add dynamism and visual interest to your video. Pan (horizontal movement), tilt (vertical movement), and zoom (focal length movement to give the illusion of moving closer or further away from the subject) are three of the most common
Lightning
Lighting in itself can tell a story. Brightness, darkness, shadows, contrast they all contribute to setting the mood and tone, communicating emotions, and creating specific effects.

Transitions
How shots transition between each other will affect the pacing and emotion of your music video.
Aspect Ratio
The relationship between the height and the width of the frame a frame's aspect ratio can impact the visual experience. A wide aspect ratio can provide a cinematic feel while a square ratio might evoke nostalgia or intimacy.
Color Pallet
Colors in a scene can directly influence the emotions of your audience.
Depth of Field
Depth of field allows you to focus attention on a specific subject while blurring the background. Shallow depth of field can isolate a subject emotionally while deep depth of field can establish context.

22 Rules for Storytelling

PIXAR
ANIMATION STUDIOS
1 You admire a character for TRYING more than for their successes.
2 You gotta keep in mind what's interesting to you AS AN AUDIENCE, not what's fun to do AS A WRITER. They can be v. different.
3 Trying for theme is important, but you won't see what the story is actually about til you're at the end of it. NOW REWRITE.
4 ONCE UPON A TIME there was Every day, One day. Because of that, Because of that, Until finally
5 SIMPLIFY. FOCUS. COMBINE characters. Hop over detours. You'll feel like you're losing valuable stuff but IT SETS YOU FREE.
6 What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. CHALLENGE THEM. How do they deal?
7 Come up with your ending BEFORE you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.
8 Finish your story, let go even if it's not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. DO BETTER NEXT TIME.
9 When you're stuck, make a list of what WOULDN'T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.
10 Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you've got to RECOGNIZE it before you can use it.
11 PUTTING IT ON PAPER lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you'll never share it with anyone.
12 Discount the 1"thing that comes to mind. And the 2 ^ (cd) 3rd, 4 deg 5 ^ n -get the obvious out of the way. SURPRISE YOURSELF.
13 Give your characters OPINIONS. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it's poison to the audience.
14 Why must you tell THIS story? What's the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That's the heart of it.
15 If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? HONESTY LENDS CREDIBILITY to unbelievable situations.
16 What are the STAKES? Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if they DON'T SUCCEED? Stack the odds against.
17 NO WORK IS EVER WASTED. If it's not working, let go and move on - it'll come back around to be useful later.
18 You have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best & fussing. STORY IS TESTING, NOT REFINING.
19 Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.
20 EXERCISE: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How d'you rearrange them into what you DO like?
21 You gotta identify with your situation/characters, can't just write 'cool'. What would make YOU act that way?
22 WHAT'S THE ESSENCE OF YOUR STORY? Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build out from there.

1
Closeup of the hands
What is being done? Some mystery is fine by going in very close up: engages the viewer
2
Closeup of the face
Who's doing it? Frame it well, give "talk space" in front of eyes/nose. OK to cut off top of head, but not chin. SHOW TWO EYES!
3
Wide shot
Where is it being done? Get context, environment, mood and location information of the subject and surroundings
4
Over the shoulder
How is it done? Combine previous three ideas into one shot. Get right over shoulder for point-of-view (POV).
5
Unusual/alternative
What else should viewer know? Be imaginative: stand on a chair, crawl on your belly, vary what's in the foreground or background. This will be particular to your location or story.
6
Interview
Additional shot: interview the subject to get good usable audio for voiceover and to intercut with b-roll. (See interview hints in sidebar)

TIPS TIPS FOR FILMING 10 to make your life easier when editing
01 When shooting people or products, divide the screen into thirds in your head (vertically and horizontally). Your subject should be shot in the cross-section of these thirds rather than completely central. For example, a person should be filmed across two sections and look across at the other, rather than in the centre looking straight down the lens. Sometimes, your decision will be dictated on where the best light is.
02 When filming a panorama, try and place your camera on a tripod for smoother movements. Always count a second in your head (1 Mississippi) before moving the camera going too fast will mean your edited film does not do the view justice as will move too quickly.
03 When filming interviews/talking heads always get your subject to say their name on camera far easier than scrabbling around for a pen and helps you test your volume levels at the same time.
04 Never zoom in when someone is talking on screen you will kick yourself when editing if you need to edit something they say as the shot set up will be different if you zoomed and look jerky.
05 Always film some 'cutaways'. These are shots of your location and surroundings. E.g. road signs. They will help to cover up basic editing skills making any film look professional!
06 Transitions are one of the key differentia-tors between an amateur video and a professional one. Decide how you want to cut or fade from scene-to-scene before you film. This will help ensure you have enough footage. Getting this right means you can join frames together seamlessly.
07
Never film with direct sunlight behind your subject matter. This will cause shadow, which is difficult to correct in the edit stages.
08
Always take a moment to step back and listen to your surroundings. If you're filming outside and can hear wind, traffic noise, building works etc, so will your mic. If you're just filming scenery this noise can easily be edited out at a later stage BUT, if you need to hear what someone is saying you need to have a rethink. Background noise over a speaking voice is much harder to fix later on so either change your set up or if you know your location is busy, invest in a cheap lapel mic, which ensures the spoken word is the strongest audio being collected by your camera.
09 Always make a shot list before setting out to film. This will ensure you never have to waste time going back to film something you forgot or miss a key moment.
10
Adding music is often an essential part of any edit and can make or break a video. Don't be scared to trim the song you want down to size but remember, when using music commercially you will need to pay for the rights. Alternatively there are some good royalty free sites like: www.musicloops.com

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION, VOL PC-24, NO.2, JUNE 19:
How to write with style
By Kurt Vonnegut
International Paper asked Kurt Vonnegut, author of such novels as "Slaughterhouse-Five," "Jailbird" and "Cat's Cradle, to tell you how to put your style and personality into everything you write
Newspaper reporters and technical writers are trained to reveal almost nothing about themselves in their writings. This makes them freaks in the world of writers, since almost all of the other ink-stained wretches in that world reveal a lot about themselves to readers. We call these revelations, accidental and intentional, elements of style.
These revelations tell us as readers what sort of person it is with whom we are spending time. Does the writer sound ignorant or informed, stupid or bright, crooked or honest, humorless or playful -? And on and on.
Why should you examine your writing style with the idea of im-proving it? Do so as a mark of re-spect for your readers, whatever you're writing. If you scribble your thoughts any which way, your readers will surely feel that you care nothing about them. They will mark you down as an egomaniac or a chowderhead - or, worse, they will stop reading you.
The most damning revelation you can make about yourself is that you do not know what is inter-esting and what is not. Don't you yourself like or dislike writers
mainly for what they choose to show you or make you think about? Did you ever admire an empty-headed writer for his or her mastery of the language? No.
So your own winning style must begin with ideas in your head.
1. Find a subject you care about
Find a subject you care about and which you in your heart feel others should care about. It is this genuine caring, and not your games with language, which will be the most compelling and seduc-tive element in your style.
I am not urging you to write a novel, by the way - although I would not be sorry if you wrote one, provided you genuinely cared about something. A petition to the mayor about a pothole in front of your house or a love letter to the girl next door will do.
2. Do not ramble, though I won't ramble on about that.
3. Keep it simple
As for your use of language:
Remember that two great masters of language, William Shakespeare and James Joyce, wrote sentences which were almost childlike when their subjects were most profound. "To be or not to be?" asks Shakespeare's Hamlet. The longest word is three letters long. Joyce, when he was frisky, could put together a sentence as intricate and as glittering as a neck-lace for Cleopatra, but my favorite sentence in his short story "Eveline" is this one: "She was tired." At that point in the story, no other words could break the heart of a reader as those three words do.
Simplicity of language is not only reputable, but perhaps even sacred. The Bible opens with a sentence well within the writing skills of a lively fourteen-year-old: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."
4. Have the guts to cut
It may be that you, too, are capable of making necklaces for Cleopatra, so to speak. But your eloquence should be the servant of the ideas in your head. Your rule might be this: If a sentence, no matter how excellent, does not il-luminate your subject in some new and useful way, scratch it out.
5. Sound like yourself
The writing style which is most natural for you is bound to echo the speech you heard when a child. English was the novelist Joseph Conrad's third language, and much that seems piquant in his use of English was no doubt colored by his first language, which was Pol-ish. And lucky indeed is the writer who has grown up in Ireland, for the English spoken there is so amusing and musical. I myself grew up in Indianapolis, where common speech sounds like a band saw cutting galvanized tin,
Should act upon the urgings that I feel, or remain passive and thus cease to exist?
To be or not to be?
"Keep it simple. Shakespeare did, with Hamlet's famous soliloquy"
