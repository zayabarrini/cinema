Martha interacts with him via instant messaging and video call, talking on countryside walks and neglecting her sister's attempts to reach out. The next stage is a physical android version of Ash, which begins to make Martha uncomfortable.

In a cabin, Matt and Joe talk about their past. Matt used to run an online group who watched each other seduce women through "Z-Eyes" that record vision and hearing.

Matt's former profession was training "cookies"—digital clones of people stored in an egg-shaped object—as personal assistants. Meanwhile, Joe's wife "blocked" him with the Z-Eyes, so that he could not communicate with her after an argument over her planned abortion. Joe travelled to Beth's father's house each Christmas to spy on Beth and the child—whom she kept, but whom Joe also cannot see. After Beth's death, he was able to see the child, but he was not the father. Joe confronted Beth's father and killed him, leaving the daughter to freeze to death. Matt reveals that they are both in a cookie, and Joe has just confessed to his crimes. Joe will be imprisoned, while Matt is registered as a sex offender and blocked by everybody.

Her flight there is cancelled and she is too low-rated to qualify for a replacement. She argues with a staff member and security temporarily subtracts a point from her rating and places her on "double damage", which increases the effect of poor ratings. With her new rating, she can only rent an old car, which breaks down. Lacie hitchhikes with Susan—a truck driver rated 1.4. Naomi uninvites Lacie due to her lower rating, but she gatecrashes the wedding and attempts to deliver her speech. Increasingly agitated, Lacie grabs a knife as guests give her low ratings.

Bandersnatch	David Slade	Charlie Brooker	28 December 2018
Bandersnatch is an interactive film, where viewer choices affect the storyline. Stefan Butler, a young programmer, works on a video game adaptation of a "choose your own adventure" book, Bandersnatch. He successfully pitches it to Tuckersoft in a meeting with the head Mohan Thakur and the game developer Colin Ritman. Stefan becomes stressed while working from home and attends therapy. The viewer can see Stefan talking about his mother's death. Stefan can take hallucinogens with Colin and hear his alternate timeline theories.

The game's success upon release depends on the viewers' choices, as does whether Stefan is imprisoned and the game pulled. Some endings show Colin's daughter trying to adapt Bandersnatch into an interactive film.
