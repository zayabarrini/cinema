Top 15 Iconic RuPaul's Drag Race fights and feuds

Charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent are great assets to have but what every Drag Race fan really wants is drama! While no season is completely without antics, there are a few moments in the show’s herstory that are really memorable.

Putting the bold lip syncs and runway looks aside, here are the top 15 RuPaul’s Drag Race fights and feuds featured on the show!

## Jiggly Caliente vs Lashauwn Beyond | Season 4, Episode 1

“This is not RuPaul’s Best Friend Race!” Who knew one of the show’s most iconic lines in drag race herstory would be born from a fight between two amazing queens? After Lashauwn Beyond calls Jiggly Caliente out for her lack of sew skills, Jiggly was hurt that Lashauwn never told her how she felt about her look. Lashauwn clapped back that she wasn’t here to “make best buddies, bitch” or “to be your friend.

## ”Yvie Oddly vs Silky Ganache and Vanessa Vanjie Mateo | Season 11

Silky Nutmeg Ganashe’s feud with Yvie Oddly lasted the entirety of Season 11, with their fights basically taking over every episode of Untucked. Throughout the season, Yvie made her critiques of her fellow contestants’ looks and performances very clear, which rubbed Silky the wrong way. Eventually, their feud even dragged in other queens, like Silky’s Dreamgirl sister Vanessa Vanjie Mateo, who got into a screaming match with Yvie after a particularly tense judging

## Heidi N Closet vs Everyone | Season 12, Episode

After getting tired of hearing the girls ganging up on Aiden Zhane, Heidi decided to chime in on the conversation. "At the end of the day it doesn't fucking matter, the bitch is safe — leave her alone," Closet said after having previously removed herself from the conversation to focus on preparing for her lip sync performance.

"I'mma worry about Heidi. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you." She points to a few of the queens feuding.

## Laganja Estranja vs Everyone | Season 6, Episode 8

As the season progressed, Laganja had been quickly getting on everyone's nerves — even their best friend Adore Delano. During her time on the show, Laganja continuously adopted catchphrases like “Okurrr!”and “Yes, Mama!” And when Bianca Del Rio pointed out the change in personality, Laganja became defensive and said they felt “very attacked!

## Aja vs Valentina | Season 9, Episode 3

We think its safe to say that Aja took sarcasm to a whole other level during this fan favorite scene. “You’re perfect, you’re beautiful, you look like Linda Evangelista, you’re a model, everything about you is perfect,” Aja mocked. Even more, fans would see the tension between the two erupt again during the season reunion, when Aja demanded Valentina’s Miss Congeniality title be changed to “Fan Favorite.”

## Tatianna vs Tyra Sanchez | Season 2, Episode 5

It was no secret that all the Season 2 queens hated Tyra. Although Tatianna, the most vocal of the bunch, was the one to confront her. Tatianna told RuPaul in front of everyone on the main stage: “I don’t think you’re seeing that Tyra is a complete bitch.Serena Cha Cha vs Everyone | Season 5, Episode 2

In this epic roast, all of season 5 got to speak their peace…”except for Serena.” Here, her lack of polish made her the butt of a playful joke about being of a different level. However, after she requested the floor to defend herself, things took a turn when she claimed that Detox deliberately overshadowed other queens.

Then, she problematically claimed that other queens are using “ghetto lexicon language” that was preventing them from communicating effectively. At this point, all the queens were done with the then 21 year old, including Detox who stood up and delivered her now-iconic statement: “I have had it… officially!”

## Phi Phi O’Hara vs Alyssa Edwards | All Stars 2, Episode 5

Phi Phi pops up on our list again for her feud with Alyssa Edwards during AS2. After Alyssa was eliminated, the remaining girls discussed why Edwards was sent home, with Phi Phi interjecting with reads and a bit of shade. But what they didn’t know was that Alyssa along with the other eliminated girls were listening in on the entire conversation. Talk about the face-crack of the century.

## Alyssa Edwards vs Jade Jolie | Season 5, Episode 5

History was made with just two words: Back Rolls. This fight features epic liners from both sides. “If I was quick to judge you, I’d judge you on that makeup or I could judge you on your lack of talent,” Alyssa says to Jade Jolie, who then replies, “If I was gonna judge anyone, I’d judge you on that body where them shoulders should match them hips, but they don’t, so…”

## Alyssa Edwards vs Coco Montrese | Season 2

Talk about a duo with beef. From the moment Montese walked through the door, viewers knew it was going to be an amazing season. The two pageant divas gave each other the cold shoulder from the get-go, largely centering around Alyssa winning Miss Gay America in 2010, but having to give her crown to her runner-up, Coco.Alyssa and Coco were both brought back for All Stars Season 2, where they revealed that they had both buried the hatchet and were on friendly terms.

## Kandy Muse vs Tamisha Iman | Season 13

Despite fan complaints of a boring season, this Untucked episode proved drama is around every corner of the RuPaul’s Drag Race set. After Iman admitted she didn’t care for some of the “arrogant” girls in the competition, Kandy Muse immediately became defensive, asking if the other queens felt she was arrogant. The fight was so bad, it even looked like the altercation was going to get physical.Thought, it did spawned a number of catchphrases, such as Tamisha’s “I said what I said.”

## Mimi Imfurst vs Everyone | All Stars 1, Episode 1

The Untucked Lounge proves that not everything in the past, stays in the past. As Mimi was defending her decision to the other contestants, nearly everyone had something to say about it. Ultimately, it was Raven who finally dealt the final blow after Mimi said she didn’t want to talk about events from outside the competition.

“Well, guess what Mimi. We did,” Raven seethed. “You, Mimi Imfurst. Mimi Imfurst was number third in the voting? I could not believe it.” To which Mimi exclaimed, “Do not attack my fans, b*tch.” However, Raven was quick to troll back, “From the sh*t that I’ve seen, you don’t have that many.”

## Mystique vs Morgan McMichaels | Season 6, Episode 8

During the first ever episode of Untucked, Season 2 queens Mystique and Morgan McMichaels got into it and it seems like it almost got physical! After Morgan accused Mystique of having “no class and no manners” and telling her to “go fix your hair, fix your mug,” Mystique shot back with a threat that is now an iconic quote in Drag Race herstory: “I will whoop your f*ckin' ass, b*tch! I am from Chicago!” This arguably set the tone or future Untucked episodes to come!

## Phi Phi O’Hara vs Sharon Needles | Season 6, Episode 8

Truly one for the books is the season-long feud between Phi Phi and Sharon. When Sharon tried to tell Phi Phi that she felt pushed into doing a spooky look, Phi Phi screamed across the room, “Sharon, you are not even on the same level as me, so get the fu\*k out of my face,” which led to Sharon labelling Phi Phi a “tired-ass showgirl.”

This comment triggered one of the most iconic lines, in not just Drag Race but pop culture as a whole, as Phi Phi snapped: “At least I am a showgirl, bitch! Go back to Party City where you belong!”

## Shangela vs Mimi Imfurst | Season 3, Episode 3

Arguably one of the most iconic fights in RPDR herstory is the altercation between Shangela and Mimi. Shangela really came for Mimi, telling her she could “never be glam.” In response, Mimi accused Shangela of having a “sugar daddy.” Shangela then served one of the greatest comebacks of all time.Between the drinks flying, witty insults and utter chaos, this moment goes down as one of the most “sickening” fights in the show’s run.

No, I was listening to every single word, but you didn't allow me to say anything, so that was the truth of it.
Welcome to Miz Mojo, and today we're counting down our picks for the Drag
Race castmates who had it in for each other. For this list, we're only including queens from the American franchise and only taking into account feuds that happened on the show and extended beyond a single argument.
You're perfect. You're beautiful. You look like Linda Evangelista. You're a model.
Bob vs Thorgy
Number 20. Bob the Drag Queen versus
Thorgy Thor season 8.
I'm the loudest one.
Shut up, Bob.
Jealousy rears its ugly head once again.
Bob was more of a comedy queen and
Thorgy more serious about her craft. In fact, Thorgy thought Bob the drag queen was all over the place.
Thorgy always comes for him. Thorgy really wants to be Bob. I think that's kind of like her personal vendetta in this competition. The show's events didn't help the situation when Thorgy was certain she'd won season 8's acting challenge and Bob snatched the crown from her head.
I've made some decisions.
Thorgy Thor, you're safe.
In a postseason interview, Bob reminisced about her win and revealed that Thorgy had exercised her mighty powers and slapped the aforementioned victor across the face. Number 19, Derek
Barry versus Naomi Smalls, season 8. I'm wondering, is this your roller girl look, neon look, or Madonna kimono look?
They're all the same.
The cattiness between these two was straight out of Mean Girls.
Derek and Naomi, they're like Tom and
Jerry. Like Nene Leaks and Kim Zoak.
Derek, tell me about your drag. Well, I don't really have a drag style. There is no Derek Barry. There is Britney Spears, but I hand sewed this piece of fabric that's just buttoned up around my waist.
Derek Barry was basically picked on throughout season 8, or so she claims.
But perhaps the most memorable was her workroom battle of the wits with Naomi
Smalls. Luckily for her, Dererick seems to be rather thick skinned and retaliates with surprising ease. When
Naomi points out Dererick's thinning hair, she immediately responds that
Naomi could have had a career in drag.
If only she learned to glue her wigs down. Snap. In the season's puppet episode, Dererick insulted Naomi's style and talent while the latter watched clearly unimpressed.
When I impersonate Britney Spears for a living, and that's why it bugs me because we're coming into this competition and we're representing ourselves. We're not representing a celebrity.
Malaysia vs Mistress
Number 18, Malaysia Baby Doll Fox versus
Mistress Isabelle Brooks, season 15. A few weeks in, Malaysia hadn't exactly impressed some of her competitors. Among her detractors was Mistress Isabelle
Brooks. Mistress had questions about
Malaysia's taste level and didn't keep them to herself. I think that Malaysia lacks a certain taste level. She has a severe case of drag delusion, girl.
This rivalry was fun and mutual for the most part. However, some of the digs started to cut deeper when Malaysia accused Mistress of being a bully.
And the way that y'all was responding was like, "We not figuring nothing out.
It's already said and done." Y'all was like, "Oh, we're doing it. It's ours.
Blah blah blah.
The thing that stands out about these two is that they're friends. However, they weren't interested in winning
RuPaul's best friends race. Malaysia and
Mistress both had the capacity to throw massive amounts of shade, and their biggest targets were often each other.
I apologize if I made you feel that way, but at the end of the day, I'm not going to apologize for how I felt in that moment and for how it was.
And that's the same way. And that's why
I said what I said.
Aiden vs Britta
Number 17, Aiden Zayn versus Britta
Filter, season 12. To be fair, both of these queens had a rough time on season 12. Brida came in expecting to do much better than she did. And Aiden Zayn was the underdog who never really shined.
So, when Brida started underperforming, she zeroed in on a queen she didn't think was as good as her.
I'm going above and beyond. Like, it's one thing to just lay there and for me to like carry it to the finish line. I mean, it's pretty easy to play dead. Um, after working together during an improv challenge, Britta questioned Aiden's authority as a leader.
I'm nervous about our team. Aiden was definitely the weakest link. I honestly felt like you didn't really lead us
Aquaria vs Miz Cracker much.
Then she came for Aiden's dedication to the competition. Whether it was strategic or just a simple case of resentment, Brit just couldn't get past her rivals successes. and I'm working so hard and I'm I'm really giving everything that I have to do this and I don't think that Aiden should have been safe.
She may have sent Aiden home, but Britta followed her out the door the week after. Number 16, Aquaria versus Miz
Cracker, season 10.
Cracker, your twin is here. It's battle between the twins, y'all. Who's the twins? Cracker and Aquaria.
The Aquaria and Miz Cracker feud preceded the show. And when the two appeared and competed against each other, things got heated. The two had similar looks, and this led to comparison and accusations of drag look thievery. After Bob the Drag Queen posted sidebyside photos of the two, it became apparent that they resemble each other both in and out of makeup. Ms.
Cracker admitted in an interview that the two yo-yo between blowouts and friendship on and off the screen. And we can only assume it will remain the same due to that uncanny twin effect. It's come up a couple times. I've overheard people saying like, "Oh, well, you know,
Aquaria, she has sugar daddies."
Lux Noir vs Lucy Leuca
Number 15, Lux Noir London and Mistress
Isabelle Brooks versus Lucy Luca. Season 15. Throughout the season, two finalists were a tag team of workroom mischief, and they had one consistent target.
Lucy, how are you feeling?
The seal.
Still feeling good, honestly.
Mistress laughs every time I open my mouth.
Sure, Lucy Leuca sometimes had some delusions about her place in the competition, but she also showcased her insecurities plenty of times. And Lux
Noir and Mistress Isabelle were right there to make sure she continued second-guessing herself. I came in second last week. She didn't. So, I don't really understand why she's trying to sort of read me, but we all know the deal. Talent gets you to the finale, not mind games.
Lucy fought back, but she wasn't able to compete with the 4D chess these two were playing most of the time. Some might call it competition. Others might call it psychological warfare. It's definitely peak drag race drama.
I'm not even cutting up. I just feel like you're not being real, Lucy.
You think I'm not being real right now?
This is the most real that I can be.
Just be honest. You won heaven cuz it's the lead role. It would be a lie to say that you wouldn't fit the description of tough. Oh my god.
Tatiana vs Tyra
Number 14, Tatiana versus Tyra Sanchez, season 2.
I'm not going to replay it because I already know what happened and you already know what happened. I'm not replaying it with you over and over again. There isn't anything else to say.
But why are you talking?
Why are you talking?
The season 2 champion is still one of the show's most controversial figures.
Her attitude toward her competitors was either callously aloof or downright hostile, and she made no apologies about it. and I'm just in my own world. I honestly
I wasn't paying attention to any of the other girls.
This was especially hard for Tatiana to take. If there was one thing she couldn't stand, it was a bully. Though tension between the two had built over the season, it all boiled over during the Here Comes the Bride challenge. Both of them made their animosity known on the main stage right in front of RuPaul. and like really really pissed me off cuz she talks so much about so many people but won't say it to their face.
You really shouldn't play the victim. It doesn't suit you. You don't do it well.
This is one of those feuds that seems to have lived on way after the season.
Gia vs Pheramone
Number 13, Gia Gun versus Pheramone. All
Stars 4.
That leaves Gia Gun and Pheramone.
I actually thought I was going to be the first one picked. I don't think any of these girls really know what I do other than look gorgeous. Gia and Farah were another couple of queens who brought their extra sparkly baggage into the competition. The two apparently had an altercation at a club in the past, and this led to an uncomfortable verbal exchange in the workroom so that I can have closure.
Gorge, you're getting ready?
Yeah. Yeah. Do your makeup and get ready, sweetie, cuz according to your team, you're the weakest link.
Oh Oh, here we go. Gia is said to be stirring the pot when she raises the issue again. And Farah accuses her of doing so, only to turn the camera's spotlights on herself and do what you're doing.
Oh, sweetie, I'm very secure. Are you secure?
Okay.
It is taking everything in my power right now, not to completely go off on this
It's a little hard to feel sympathetic for Gia in this situation as she opens the conversation with an insult. I was just trying to see in case today's your last day here in the competition how you feel about our friendship and our past. You are taking up my time right now and I don't have time for it.
Adore vs Lagona
Number 12, Adore Delano versus Lagona
Estanja. Season 6. Bianca Del Rio's long-standing irritation is what touched off her legendary untucked argument with
Laganja.
I believe that you've come into this competition with an act. You came in, water works, wo is me, wo is me, wo is me, and you're not even given a true story. So, explain that to me.
Adore vs Laganja
But the true rivalry was between two queens who were friends before the season. Laganja Estanja struggled on season 6. Not only was she criticized for her presumed fakeness, but she was having to watch her friend Adore Delano win more challenges than her. But in the outside world, I'm used to winning. So, in this competition, it's really hard to see all my friends get a lot of praise, especially Adore, because I don't think her look is as strong as mine.
Laganja felt that Adore's drag was not as polished as hers. The judges clearly did not agree. That feeling of being overshadowed colored their relationship until Laganja's elimination. Adore and I have an advantage because we've worked together many times in the outside world. I'm just really nervous that
Adore will overshadow me and that I won't be the star. Things were so uncertain between them that for the reunion, RuPaul actually had them sit down together to watch a video package of their rivalry. It was, in a word, uncomfortable.
I was just trying to be funny, but then you're saying that that's you. You can say that all this is fake, but this is real.
Bitter Old Lady Brigade vs Young Look Queens
Number 11, Bitter Old Lady Brigade versus Young Look Queens, season 7. More appreciated now than when it aired, this season saw a sharp divide between its queens. Ginger Ming, Kennedy Davenport,
Mrs. Kasha Davis, and early out Jasmine
Masters formed the lovingly named Bitter
Old Lady Brigade.
Miss Kasha Davis, Jasmine, and Kennedy and myself. We just call ourselves the
Bitter Old Lady Brigade. But we don't mean any harm, girl. Except when we do.
They placed themselves in opposition to younger, more aesthetic focused queens like Violet Chachki, Pearl, Trixie
Mattel, and Miss Fame. Mostly older and more seasoned than their competitors, the Old Lady Brigade didn't always take the young queen seriously due to their focus on looks over humor and performance.
Fame, Trixie, Pearl, then there's that old tied ass long course, Violet. Them four just wear my nerves out. They don't know about performance. These tensions simmerred throughout the competition, but came to define the whole season in the final stretch.
Before this episode, before we went out there and said all that I liked all of you and now I don't.
You don't like us?
I don't like I miss my friends now.
Plain Jane vs Amanda Tory
Number 10, Plain Jane versus Amanda Tory
Meeting, season 16. This season's villain immediately earned her title.
Plain Jane's reads were so frequent that at a certain point if she wasn't reading her competitors, it's because she wasn't talking at all.
Well, I rest assured I definitely have more respect for you than I do for
Amanda.
Why are you such a Honestly, what's with this? I have more respect for you than I do with Amanda. Like, where is this coming from?
After seeing Amanda Tory meetings drag,
Plane immediately apologized to the fandom for having to see it.
I think Amanda's drag looked hideous.
I'm so sorry to the Drag Race audience for having to witness such a goblin.
She made her opinions known often. While
Amanda wasn't the only target, Plain's continued straightforwardness about her work started to weigh on Amanda. Even
Plain's attempt at an apology touched off yet another argument in Untucked.
I felt the need to express my opinion to you, and it was unwarranted.
So, this is the last apology that I'll give you, though, and you better bring it moving forward. So, what does that mean, girl?
Honestly, it's almost as if these two just didn't speak the same language.
Raven vs Tatiana
Number nine, Raven versus Tatiana, season 2. Drag Race's sophomore season was one of the most contentious ever.
Finalist Raven seemed to be annoyed with
Tatiana from the beginning.
Tatiana's an airhead. Tatiana doesn't have an opinion or a voice. The only thing she has is a pretty face, and even that, I'm getting sick of. Raven made it clear that she thought Tatiana's runways were basic.
All of you guys think that I'm like that
I'm like nothing.
I would never say that.
Her interview was her look. Her book cover was her trying to launch and sell her book to the judges with this became full-blown resentment on both sides by the end of the season.
Taking most of their swipes at each other in the confessionals. Tatiana and
Raven never really had a blowup on camera until the reunion. RuPaul couldn't wait to show them clips of all the things they said about each other until the point. Okay, I'm not done talking yet. You will speak when I'm done.
Honey, girl, security. She has gotten everything that she wanted to say out about me. It's my
Bendel vs Darien turn.
Number eight, Bendel Creme versus Darien
Lake, season 6.
And that leaves Bendel Creme and Darien
Lake.
Really?
Sometimes the rivalry is one-sided. In season 6, Darien seemed to have something against Ben. Perhaps a certain greeneyed monster made an appearance here as Da did not seem to want to join in on the charade.
I feel like there's been a little bit of tension between Darien and I lately, but
I think that she's super talented, so I think this is a good pairing.
It didn't help that Ben was somewhat of a fan favorite, making Darien's attempts to lessen the appeal of the queen more difficult.
Now, do you know any cougars?
We are cougars.
I'm too young and pretty to be a cougar.
In one scene where the two had to work together, this unease was as thick as a high-end wig. As RuPaul asked the two about working with each other, Darien seemed to claim that it is touchandgo, whereas Da appeared surprised at the former's reaction. Number seven, Bob the
Bob vs Derek
Drag Queen versus Derek Barry. Season 8.
The Britney impersonator and the New
York comedy queen had very different styles of drag. Let's just say that
Derek Barry struggled to break out of her usual makeup while Bob was slaying the competition, even if some of her looks weren't up to Dererick's standards.
Hey Bob, if I want to do Ratchet drag next week, can you give me any tips?
If you want to do like memorable drag next week, I can give you some tips.
These two had the makings of being an alltime Drag Race feud from the very first Untucked.
You are doing the basics of comedy.
Look, there's a reef on my That's comedy 101.
I don't think what you did is funny, though.
My My outfit's not funny. I'm funny.
Bob had Dererick figured out from the jump, but Dererick was hard-headed enough to go toe-to-toe with her. Their rivalry culminated in a fantastic lipsync that saw Bob winning out.
Heathers vs Boogers
Outside of the heat of competition, the two have since become friends. Number six, Heathers versus Boogers season 3.
Long before the all-star queens were voting each other out, Drag Race had its first case of competing alliances.
Self-proclaimed pretty girls Raja Manila
Luzon, Delta Work, and Carmen Carrera started calling each other Heather.
Heather, can you help me?
Yes, Heather.
I think it's hilarious. We're calling each other Heather now.
Well, I mean, aren't we? Those are our names.
Initially formed as an in joke between friends, the season started to revolve around their feeling of superiority over the boogers of the season.
And I don't want you to think that I'm attacking you, but I am attacking you because ultimately this is a competition and I want to beat you. Looking back, it does seem like the whole thing was blown out of proportion, but it did create some entertaining untucked drama between the
Heathers, Shangela, Stacy Lane Matthews, and Alexis Mateo.
No, you always talking about being real.
We are being real with you. We're telling you right now what's going on.
So, be real. I'll be real.
Be real, girl. Be real. Hallelu. Be
Roxy vs Jinx Monsoon real.
Number five, Rol Alaska Talks versus
Jinx Monsoon season 5. Day one, we walked in here as Alaska Talks and girl, here we stand with little Jinx. No offense, Jinx. The popular kids from season 5, the trio of Alaska, Detox, and
Roxy, also known as Rolastox or Rolodex, formed a click and essentially picked on all those they considered to be unpolished queens. The bulk of their wrath was felt by Jinx Monsoon.
Incidentally, the trio found themselves up against Jinx in the final episodes. I would say Jinx Monsoon.
Absolutely love her, but I feel like there's maturing that I would like to see. Jinx had her talents put to the test in a final lip-sync battle against rival Detox, but emerged victorious and broke up the precious click. Despite their predatory attempts to get her eliminated, their prey won the season.
Mean Girls finished last.
Jinx Monsoon.
Silky vs Eevee Oddley
Number four, Silky Nutmeg Ganache versus
Eevee Oddley, season 11.
Eevee should go home just because she's hurt and we ain't got time for that.
Silky and Eevee were definitely never meant to be BFFs. The two buted heads throughout the season like fabulous feuding goats. Eevee was a little too honest for Silky's taste, and her bold words took things a step too far when she called Silky talentless.
Silky ganache.
Why? I think Silky has been the most resistant to your critiques and the judges.
Silky never quite recovered from the insult. The two tried throughout season
11 to get each other ousted, and fans seemed divided between the two as well.
However, some online polls showed a landslide victory by Eevee Oddley when it came to fan opinions. Whose side are
The Vixen vs Eureka you on? Number three, The Vixen versus
Eureka season 10.
Girl, she can say or do the exact same thing that I say or do, and you act like she didn't do
Your mother. I do not owe you. I do not owe you talking about
The vixen just simply couldn't stand
Eureka. The two frequently bickered throughout their shared airtime. Aside from racial tensions pointed out adamantly by Vixen, there was a bit of a rich queen, poor queen vibe to this feud. Vixen felt that some queens had an unfair advantage in their overflowing designer handbags of cash. She also felt that Eureka specifically already had a rapport with the judges, having been on the show in a previous season. Let's just say Vixen was a portrait of the old adage, it's not fair.
I'm not going.
Koko Montrice vs Alyssa Edwards
Number two, Koko Montrice versus Alyssa
Edwards, season five.
I feel so mentally drained right now.
I'm trying to finish my costume and this whole Alyssa thing, it's still bothering me.
Once more, we have a case of a shady past being dragged onto the show. Excuse the pun. These two were former competitors in the Miss Gay America pageant.
Miss Coco, you're going to have to do a little bit more pink in the eye. Well, you concerned about what's going on over here when you need to be worried about what's going on over there with that same makeup you've been running on the runway every single time.
Alyssa was crowned yet was dethroned shortly after to be replaced by runner-up Koko. This led to Koko slandering Alyssa on social media.
Somehow Koko plays the victim in the situation. Something that is just as confusing to us as it is to you.
I'm not joking,
You going to call me a runner up. You ain't never won nothing. The two end up facing off in an intense lip-sync battle, which they consider to be some form of redemption for the past. The energy is palpable and over the top as
Koko swirls her sleeves with rapid strength, and Alyssa does an impressive spin and splits combination.

Number one, vivaceious versus her zipper.
Yes, mama. Come on.
Pull it down, baby.
Let us see.
It was all dramatic and then it was just kidding. Diamonds are a girl's best friend. Zippers are her greatest foes, but her real number one is number one.
Sharon Needles vs Fifi OHara
Sharon Needles versus Fifi O'Hara season 4.
Well, basically what I said was I felt that you kind of pushed me into, you know, just doing my spooky look and that it was irresponsible and I thought it was kind of sloppy just to because I told you to do something that you're good at.
The feud between Sharon Needles and Fifi
O'Hara was filled with zingers, which is what places it in our number one position. Fifi didn't appreciate
Sharon's gothic queen look and didn't hesitate to share said information. She felt that the latter's dark influences didn't belong on the stage and the animosity was palpable. Any fan of the show upon mentioning this feud will immediately parrot the phrase, "Go back to Party City," with excitement.
Tired ass showgirl showgirl. At least I am a show girl, Go back to Party
City where you belong.
Fifi uttered this retort in response to
Sharon calling her a tired ass showgirl.
Of course, Fifi also had issues with other queens, namely Alyssa Edwards. You can't get upset because you were eliminated and someone had their opinions on why you should be gone.

# Survivor

When Survivor debuted in May of 2000, no one could have predicted the show would become a cultural phenomenon. Almost twenty years later, it is not only still one of TV’s most popular shows, but it continues to evolve. While still a game about social constructs, the show has become synonymous with backstabs and blindsides.

Players are more aggressive now and favor voting out threats earlier, even if they have to vote out an alliance member. Throughout thirty-nine seasons, Survivor has seen its fair share of betrayals. Here are the 10 most vicious betrayals in Survivor history.

## Black Widows Convincing Eric Into Giving Up Individual Immunity (Survivor: Micronesia)

Survivor erik gives up immunity
Survivor: Micronesia is well known for the countless blindsides at the hands of the Black Widow alliance. As the game reached the final five, their last remaining target, Erik, foiled their plan to vote him out by winning his third straight immunity necklace. Cirie devised a plan to convince Erik into giving up immunity to redeem himself in front of the jury, and they would side with Erik to vote out Parvarti.

In the most infamous move in Survivor history, Erik gave up immunity and was subsequently voted out, likely costing himself the title of Sole Survivor.

## Varner outing Zeke (Survivor: Game Changers)

Varner and Zeke at Tribal Council Survivor Game Changers.
The real world and gameplay can become blurred in a game like Survivor, a lesson Jeff Varner learned the hard way in Survivor: Game Changers. Feeling like his back was against the wall, Varner attacked the honesty and integrity of Zeke at tribal council. In doing so, Varner revealed to the rest of the tribe that Zeke was hiding the fact that he is transgendered.

To the credit of Zeke, he handled the moment with extreme grace but he couldn’t hide the feeling of betrayal in his shocked reaction. The tribe immediately jumped to Zeke’s defense, only cementing Varner’s fate.

## J.T Getting Voted Out With His Idol (Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains)

JT Survivor Heroes Vs Villains
In Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains, the Heroes tribe struggled early on in the game but picked up momentum leading into the merge. With all the men on the Villains tribe being voted out, the Heroes incorrectly assumed that there was an all women’s alliance dominating the game. Trying to pull in Russell, the last remaining man on the Villains tribe, J.T. slipped Russell the Heroes’ hidden immunity idol along with a heartfelt note pleading with Russell to join them.

Russell ended up passing on the idol to Parvarti who used the idol at the first tribal after the merge to successfully vote J.T. out. This paved the way for Russell and Parvarti to dominate the rest of the game, effectively ending the Heroes' chances of winning.

## Dreamz Not Honoring His Deal With Yau-Man (Survivor: Fiji)

Yau-Man being voted out Survivor Fiji
While no longer a staple, Survivor used to award one castaway a brand new car as part of a reward challenge every year. At the conclusion of the Survivor: Fiji car challenge, fan-favorite Yau-Man emerged the winner of a brand new truck. With his eyes set on the end game, Yau-Man made a deal with Dreamz to give him the truck in exchange for individual immunity should Dreamz win it at the final four.

Sure enough, Dreamz outlasted the rest of his tribe to win the final four immunity. Correctly sensing he would be voted out if he gave up the immunity necklace, Dreamz went back on his word with Yau-Man who subsequently was voted out, sending him home one day short of the final tribal council.

## Ciera Voting Out Her Mother (Survivor: Blood vs. Water)

Survivor: Blood vs. Water was filled with many shocking moments, but none felt more personal than Ciera voting out her mother, Laura. By day 26, Laura and Ciera were the only family pair left in the game.

Tyson quickly mobilized his alliance to vote out Laura, including Ciera in the plan. Ciera initially agreed but worked hard after the immunity challenge to flip the vote onto Katie once Ciera discovered she didn’t have an idol. Tyson was concerned this move would give Ciera more power, so they move forward with voting out Laura. With everyone voting out Laura, Ciera couldn’t risk her own game by voting against the alliance and wrote her own mother’s name down at tribal council.

## Rob Voting Out Lex After Asking Him To Protect Amber (Survivor: All-Stars)

Rob and Amber Survivor All-Stars
Survivor: All-Stars was a coming-out party for Rob Mariano. After a poor showing in Survivor Marquesas, Boston Rob emerged to take control of the game along with his tribemate and romantic partner Amber
; however, an untimely tribe swap put their game into jeopardy as Rob and Amber were split up.

Rob approached Lex with a deal: if Lex takes care of Amber, Rob will take care of Lex. Seeing an opportunity to form a strong alliance, Lex held up his end of the deal and chose not to vote Amber out at the next tribal. Once the tribes merged, Rob saw Lex as too big a threat and decided, along with Amber, to vote Lex out the first chance he had.

## Dawn Voting Out Brenda (Survivor: Caramoan)

Dawn struggled with the idea since Brenda was her friend but she knew Brenda would beat her in the end. Dawn ultimately sided with Cochran and Sherri to vote out Brenda. Shocked, Brenda broke down in tears as she walked up to have her torch snuffed. Dawn reached the final three but received no votes.

## James Being Voted Out With Two Idols (Survivor: China)

James Two Idols Survivor China
During Survivor: China, hidden immunity idols were not as prevalent as they are today. When James entered the merge with two idols and a strong alliance, he seemed sure to make it to the end.

With only seven people left in the game, James’s closest allies recognized they would lose all opportunity to vote James out if he made it to the next two tribal councils so they moved to blindside him. James didn't see his ouster coming and chose not to play either idol. James would be the first castaway ever voted out with two idols in his pocket.

## Tai Turning On Scot (Survivor: Kaoh Rong)

Tai, Jason, Scot Survivor Koah Rong
One of the twists introduced in Survivor: Koah Rong was the super idol, an idol that could be combined with another and used after the votes were read. Jason, Scot, and Tai were all on the outside of the majority but possessed two idols. On Day 27, they all agreed to use their idols together that night at tribal council.

Jason, who won immunity, gave his idol to Scot to use. Originally targeting Tai, Aubry saw him as a valuable ally and proposed voting out Scot to save himself. Tai eventually sided with Aubry and voted for Scot. When Scot turned to Tai for his idol, he simply told Scot he couldn’t and sent Scot home packing with Jason’s idol in his pocket.

## Rob Voting Out Matt twice (Survivor: Redemption Island)

Matt, Rob, and Ometepe Tribe Survivor Redemption Island
When Matt was blindsided by Rob and his alliance, he never saw it coming. After returning to the game from Redemption Island, he had the opportunity to reposition himself with the remaining Zapatera tribe. Despite his initial betrayal and the offer of a final four deal, Matt decided to follow his heart and remain loyal to the original Ometepe tribe that blindsided him.

Matt disclosed to Rob that he and Andrea had an opportunity to flip to the Zapateras but wanted to work with him. Andrea, upset she was implicated by Matt, agreed with Rob that Matt wasn’t trustworthy and they voted him out at the very next tribal council.
