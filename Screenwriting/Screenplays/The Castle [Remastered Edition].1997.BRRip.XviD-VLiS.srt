1
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:48,220
My name is Dale Kerrigan,
and this is my story.

2
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:51,632
<i>Our family lives at 3 Highview Crescent,
Coolaroo.</i>

3
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:54,624
<i>Dad bought this place
15 years ago for a steal.</i>

4
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:58,063
<i>As the real estate agent
said, "Location, location, location."</i>

5
00:00:58,248 --> 00:00:59,943
<i>And we're right next door
to the airport.</i>

6
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,089
<i>It will be very convenient
if we ever have to fly one day.</i>

7
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:10,220
<i>Dad still can't work out
how he got it so cheap.</i>

8
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,475
<i>It's worth almost as much today
as when we bought it.</i>

9
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:16,401
<i>Our street was going to be the heart
of a major housing development.</i>

10
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:18,639
<i>But it never got up.</i>

11
00:01:18,707 --> 00:01:22,402
<i>They reckon the planes put people off.
Them and the power lines.</i>

12
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,773
<i>Not Dad. He reckons power lines
are a reminder...</i>

13
00:01:25,848 --> 00:01:28,294
<i>of man's ability
to generate electricity.</i>

14
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:33,052
<i>He's always saying
great things like that.
That's why we love him so much.</i>

15
00:01:33,117 --> 00:01:36,172
<i>Dad is the backbone
of the Kerrigan family.</i>

16
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:38,949
<i>He made our billiard table.</i>

17
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,277
Shot, Dale.

18
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:45,224
<i>In fact, he's built half this house.
He's always planning extensions.</i>

19
00:01:45,296 --> 00:01:47,144
I reckon we need a patio.

20
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:50,198
Oh, darl, how about we finish
the back room first?

21
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,107
No, I'm waiting
on some cheap siding.

22
00:01:53,172 --> 00:01:55,052
I reckon we give
the patio another go.

23
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:58,844
<i>Dad is a tow truck driver.
One of the best in the game.</i>

24
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,356
<i>He takes great pride
in his work.</i>

25
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:04,038
<i>And he comes home
with so many stories.</i>

26
00:02:04,106 --> 00:02:06,465
You see, the car was wrapped
around the pole,

27
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,301
so I said, " Why not hook the chain
on the back axle?"

28
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:11,215
See, no one
had thought of that.

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,063
<i>If Dad is the backbone,
Mum is the other bones. All of them.</i>

30
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:17,202
<i>She keeps
the family together.</i>

31
00:02:17,274 --> 00:02:19,654
<i>Dad adores Mum,
and Mum adores him.</i>

32
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:23,012
<i>They met at the greyhounds one night,
and it was love at first sight.</i>

33
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:26,360
<i>Mum just loves craft.
And she can pretty up
just about anything.</i>

34
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:28,272
How did you do that?

35
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:32,217
- Spray can and stencil, darl.
That's all you need.
- You could sell that.

36
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,454
<i>Dad always reckons
Mum could open a shop,</i>

37
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:37,326
<i>but she has a good part-time job
in the office at Sunbeam.</i>

38
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,967
<i>Dad reckons Mum is
the greatest cook on Earth.</i>

39
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:42,777
- What do you call that, darl?
- Sponge cake.

40
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:45,735
Beautiful. And what's
that stuff on top?

41
00:02:45,808 --> 00:02:49,026
- Icing sugar.
- How is it, kids?

42
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:52,310
And why would you want
to go out to a restaurant...

43
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:54,702
when this keeps coming up
night after night?

44
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,930
<i>I have two brothers
and a sister, all older than me.</i>

45
00:02:56,999 --> 00:03:01,261
<i>Steve is an apprentice mechanic,
but he spends most of his time
reading the Trading Post.</i>

46
00:03:01,335 --> 00:03:03,400
<i>He just loves
buying and trading.</i>

47
00:03:03,471 --> 00:03:05,634
Dad, ergonomic chairs.
Four of them.

48
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:07,899
- What does he want?
- One-eighty.

49
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,814
He's dreaming.

50
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,586
<i>Him and Dad
really know bargains.</i>

51
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:16,317
<i>Steve is also an ideas man.
That's why Dad calls him the ideas man.</i>

52
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:18,231
<i>He has lots of ideas.</i>

53
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:21,546
It's a motorcycle helmet
with a built-in brake light.

54
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:24,449
You are an ideas man, Steve.

55
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:26,959
<i>Dad thinks all of us
are tremendous,</i>

56
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:29,357
<i>but I guess it's no secret
that Tracey's his favorite.</i>

57
00:03:29,423 --> 00:03:31,271
How do I look, Dad?

58
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,269
<i>Dad just loves her.</i>

59
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,952
You look beautiful.

60
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,255
Thanks, Dad.

61
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,689
<i>Tracey's the only girl in the family,
apart from Mum and Gran.</i>

62
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:44,534
<i>Tracey constantly
gave Dad proud moments.</i>

63
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,751
<i>Once she was
on "The Price Is Right".</i>

64
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,677
<i>It was such
an exciting afternoon for us.</i>

65
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:52,600
Swap them around.

66
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,654
<i>None of us could actually
believe it was Tracey up there
with Larry Emdier.</i>

67
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:59,541
$45,000 worth of prizes.
The luggage needs to be more than 640.

68
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:02,767
It needs to be less
than 740.

69
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:05,128
<i>She almost won the lot.</i>

70
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:08,847
<i>If only she'd known
the price of the luggage.</i>

71
00:04:08,986 --> 00:04:10,944
I'm so sorry about that.

72
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,906
<i>But she still managed to come home
with a tumble dryer and drill set.</i>

73
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:19,226
<i>She is the only member of the Kerrigan
family who'd had a college education.</i>

74
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,963
<i>Dad reckons the day she graduated
as a fully-qualified hairdresser...</i>

75
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,258
<i>was about
the proudest day of his life.</i>

76
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:28,129
<i>I knew he thought
about that... a lot.</i>

77
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:30,520
<i>There were only two places
he did his thinking--</i>

78
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:34,662
<i>in the poolroom and out the back,
looking up at the power lines.</i>

79
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,425
<i>Yep, Dad's a real thinker.</i>

80
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:42,176
<i>But the proudest day
was the day she got married
to this nice guy called Con.</i>

81
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:45,393
<i>He is an accountant,
but also a fanatical kickboxer.</i>

82
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:47,787
<i>Now Tracey's
taken up kickboxing too.</i>

83
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:50,266
<i>Dad could not get
the smile off his face.</i>

84
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:52,665
<i>And he gave a speech
that brought the house down.</i>

85
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:55,590
Now, as the bride's parents,
I don't mind paying for the wedding,

86
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:58,403
but could you please stop busting
all them plates?

87
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:01,589
That being
a Greek custom and all.

88
00:05:02,613 --> 00:05:04,548
I suppose, as a father,

89
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:07,579
you'd like your daughter
to marry one of your own.

90
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:11,434
And let's not beat around the bush.
The Greeks have a reputation.

91
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:14,401
<i>At first, the Petropoulouses
thought he was having a go at them.</i>

92
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:16,800
<i>But Dad was just saying
how much he thought of Con.</i>

93
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:20,300
I never thought anyone
could love our Trace...

94
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:22,470
as much as me,
Sal and the boys.

95
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,247
But there is
another person. Con.

96
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:28,980
Smart, polite,
fit as a fiddle.

97
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:33,209
And anyone who loves our Trace
as much as us deserves our love.

98
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:37,152
So we love you, Con.
We love you.

99
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:39,113
Thank you, and, uh,

100
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:41,803
"Kalispera".

101
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,741
That's "Good evening."

102
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:51,270
<i>We'd had many top nights,
but this was the most top.</i>

103
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,804
<i>Pity my oldest brother
couldn't be there.</i>

104
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:56,716
<i>His name's Wayne.
He's in jail.</i>

105
00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:59,547
<i>Eight years
for armed robbery.</i>

106
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:03,641
<i>Many people call him the black sheep
of the family. But not Mum and Dad.</i>

107
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,719
<i>He got caught up with the wrong crowd.
He didn't mean to rob the gas station.</i>

108
00:06:06,852 --> 00:06:10,702
<i>Now he's sorry. With good behavior,
he'll be out in a couple of years.</i>

109
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,774
<i>I visit him every Friday.</i>

110
00:06:13,257 --> 00:06:15,110
- How's Mum?
- Good.

111
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,731
- How's Dad?
- Good.

112
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:23,006
- How's Trace?
- Good.

113
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:28,061
- How are you?
- Good.

114
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,936
- How's Dave?
- He's all right.

115
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:35,047
Good.

116
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,745
<i>Even though he's the oldest
and I'm the youngest, we get on great.</i>

117
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:40,807
<i>We can just chat for hours.</i>

118
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:44,377
Thanks for coming down.

119
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:46,966
- You want some chewy?
- No.

120
00:06:47,037 --> 00:06:51,059
<i>So, as you can see,
our family is very close-knit.</i>

121
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,648
<i>We also have pets.
Four greyhounds.</i>

122
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:55,506
<i>Banshee,</i>

123
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:57,328
<i>Starflash,</i>

124
00:06:57,396 --> 00:07:00,262
<i>Trailblazer and Coco.</i>

125
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,782
<i>Coco is the best,
most successful Dad has ever had.</i>

126
00:07:03,854 --> 00:07:07,233
<i>She picked up two firsts
in the country and a third in town.</i>

127
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:09,477
<i>Dad feeds them every morning
in big bowls...</i>

128
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:12,030
<i>that Steve made out
of tractor hubcaps.</i>

129
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:14,970
<i>They are good dogs. Good to Dad.
And Dad is good to them.</i>

130
00:07:15,044 --> 00:07:18,816
<i>All of them are descended
from his first dog, Red Rocket.</i>

131
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:22,772
<i>Dad never stops marveling
at the beauty of the greyhound.</i>

132
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:25,298
<i>In fact, he doesn't even
race them for the money.</i>

133
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,750
<i>He reckons they are noble animals.
Skinny and sleek...</i>

134
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,677
<i>and have a beautiful snout.</i>

135
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,862
<i>Another thing Dad loves
is his boat. Sea Lady.</i>

136
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,742
<i>He cleans it every Saturday
with something else Steve built.</i>

137
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:39,780
<i>It's a brush
with a hose in it.</i>

138
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:42,534
<i>Dad never stops marveling
at Steve's ideas.</i>

139
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:44,837
He's a ideas man, Steve.

140
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:47,357
<i>Steve gave it to Dad
for Father's Day.</i>

141
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,136
<i>That's something our family
prides itself on. Presents.</i>

142
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:53,786
<i>Even though none of us
have a real lot of money,</i>

143
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:56,058
<i>we love giving
each other presents.</i>

144
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:59,190
- He got a rod and reel from Trace.
- A rod and reel.

145
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,429
- I gave him a new muzzle.
- A muzzle.

146
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:03,829
<i>Wayne sent him an ashtray
he'd made in prison shop.</i>

147
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:06,643
An ashtray?
But I don't smoke.

148
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:11,494
<i>And Mum, well, Mum got him a big German
beer mug from Franklin Mint.</i>

149
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:15,307
<i>Dad couldn't believe his eyes. It was
too good to even drink beer out of.</i>

150
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:17,225
I'd like
to do pottery.

151
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,623
Oh, you should.
You'd be good at it.

152
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:22,973
This is going straight
to the poolroom.

153
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:25,531
<i>All Dad's most prized possessions
are in the poolroom –</i>

154
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,989
<i>all his mementos and things
that remind him of something special.</i>

155
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:31,930
<i>So, by him saying it was
"going straight to the poolroom"</i>

156
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:33,784
<i>meant he thought
it was special.</i>

157
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:36,980
That is a collector's item.

158
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,690
This has been
the best Father's Day ever.

159
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:42,611
<i>Of course there
were ups and downs.</i>

160
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:45,063
<i>Wayne being in jail
was an example of a down.</i>

161
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:48,201
<i>But, all in all,
3 Highview Crescent was a happy home.</i>

162
00:08:48,271 --> 00:08:50,179
<i>Dad called it his castle.</i>

163
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:52,617
<i>But one day in June,</i>

164
00:08:52,683 --> 00:08:54,852
<i>a knock at the door
was to change all that.</i>

165
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:56,774
- Yeah?
- Mr. Darryl Kerrigan?

166
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:59,935
- Yeah?
- John Clifton.
I'm from the local council.

167
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:01,857
- Is this about the dogs?
- No.

168
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:03,775
- The aerial? The extensions?
- No.

169
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:08,571
Look, if this is about
my truck on the nature strip,
I've had it out with you guys.

170
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:12,146
No, I'm a valuer
with the local council.
I'm here to do a land valuation.

171
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:15,083
- What for?
- Well, all properties
get valued from time to time.

172
00:09:15,158 --> 00:09:18,352
So, you'd be able
to give me a value on this place?

173
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,264
- That's my job.
- That'd be good.

174
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:24,806
- Do you want me
to show you around?
- If you wouldn't mind.

175
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:28,258
Oh, not at all.
Be pleased to.

176
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,385
Because, between you and me,
I reckon the values around here are--

177
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:39,642
As you can see,
I've put a fair bit of work into it.

178
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,044
Would you like me to point out
the features as we go along?

179
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:44,475
- If you wouldn't mind.
- You see that lace up there?

180
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,319
- Yeah?
- Fake. Plastic.

181
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:50,699
Gives the place
a Victoriana feel.

182
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:53,706
The chimney? Fake too.

183
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:55,632
Why is it there?

184
00:09:55,697 --> 00:09:59,655
Charm. Adds a bit of charm.
Look at the size of that aerial.

185
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,984
That's a big aerial.
What do you think? Add a bit of value?

186
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,862
- Hard to say. Yeah.
- Yeah.

187
00:10:05,927 --> 00:10:08,675
You can overcapitalize,
can't you?

188
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,074
But it's a huge aerial.

189
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:19,668
And this is my backyard.

190
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:26,545
- Shuttle. From Melbourne to Sidney.

191
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:29,927
- How close are you
to the end of the runway?
- Ah, just over the fence.

192
00:10:32,336 --> 00:10:35,181
- Is that the runway there?
- Yeah.

193
00:10:35,246 --> 00:10:37,861
- There?
- Yeah.

194
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,163
Beautiful machines.

195
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,472
Sometimes you think
they're gonna land right on top of you.

196
00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:46,131
Freaks the dogs, though.
Greyhounds.

197
00:10:46,404 --> 00:10:48,671
Large kennel.

198
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:52,214
Well, originally, it was a tree house
when the kids were growing up.

199
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,673
I was thinking of turning it
into another room.

200
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:56,506
- But the county said no.
- Ah.

201
00:10:56,642 --> 00:11:00,417
Now, here back, all landfill.
Not allowed to build there.

202
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:03,856
- Has the soil been tested?
- Oh, yeah.

203
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:06,823
Nothing too serious
in there.

204
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:09,796
What do you know
about lead?

205
00:11:13,003 --> 00:11:16,349
Oh, this is
beautiful, darl.

206
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:19,171
- What do you call these things again?
- Meat loaf.

207
00:11:19,237 --> 00:11:21,090
Everybody cooks
meat loaf, darl.

208
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:23,063
Yeah, but it's
what you do with them.

209
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:26,583
Mum reckons the trick is you
don't use minced meat.
She gets topside and crushes it.

210
00:11:26,654 --> 00:11:28,562
Is that right, darl?
Well, it shows.

211
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:30,806
She gets silverside
and she'll crush that too.

212
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,971
Dad, a guy's selling
a pair of jousting sticks.

213
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,721
Jousting sticks?
What does he want for them?

214
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:39,885
- Make us an offer.
- Darl, what do you want
with jousting sticks?

215
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:42,854
Oh, I don't know. But I reckon they
wouldn't come up all that often.

216
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:46,569
But they're jousting sticks.
What would anyone want
with jousting sticks?

217
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:49,829
Well, if you get them
for half price, it's a bargain.

218
00:11:49,897 --> 00:11:51,751
- Give him a call?
- Yeah.

219
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:57,342
I'll be interested to see
this fella's valuation.

220
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,059
- Are you thinking
of selling, Dad?
- Oh, no, mate, no.

221
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:02,395
But it would be nice to know
what we're sitting on here.

222
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:03,889
Clay.

223
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:06,296
No, mate.
The value of the house.

224
00:12:06,362 --> 00:12:11,181
You know, it's odd, because
Farouk reckoned he had
some bloke around as well.

225
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:13,772
Must've been doing
the whole street.

226
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:16,176
- Maybe the market's on the move.
- Here?

227
00:12:16,242 --> 00:12:18,311
Dad? Four-fifty.

228
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:21,642
For jousting sticks?
Tell him he's dreaming.

229
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,681
How much is a jousting stick worth,
Dad?

230
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:26,566
Well, it couldn't be more
than 250.

231
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:30,076
- Depending on the condition.
- When do we find out?

232
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:33,723
Well, we should have the official notice
in a couple of weeks.

233
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,679
But just quietly,

234
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:40,050
I reckon we could be in
for a little surprise.

235
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:42,967
Compulsorily acquired.

236
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,804
Compulsorily acquired.

237
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:51,437
You know what this means,
don't you?

238
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:56,170
- They're acquiring it compulsorily.
- It must be a mistake.

239
00:12:56,237 --> 00:12:59,050
They're gonna take our place,
and we don't get a say in it.

240
00:12:59,115 --> 00:13:03,301
- Well, how can they do that?
- I don't know. 70,000 bucks.

241
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,339
Who the hell
is Air Link?

242
00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:09,369
- Dad, a guy's selling seven coolers.
- Hang on, Steve.

243
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:11,610
What's that?
Is this about Wayne?

244
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:14,043
No, no. Look.

245
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:16,213
What do you make
of that?

246
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,259
Jesus. This is
a kick-out notice.

247
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:26,119
I'll get it. I'll get it.

248
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,378
- Ah, good day, Farouk.
- Hello, Mr. Kerrigan.

249
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,456
Can you read to me something,
please, I get today?

250
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:37,861
Yeah, sure, mate,
but I'm a bit busy at the moment.

251
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:40,772
Can I-- Can I come--

252
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:44,379
- Shit. You got one too.
- Got what?

253
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,762
What the hell
is going on?

254
00:13:47,837 --> 00:13:51,314
Jesus Christ.
Jack!

255
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:04,106
Jack, it's Darryl, mate.

256
00:14:09,738 --> 00:14:13,085
Someone is going
to take me house, Darryl.

257
00:14:19,873 --> 00:14:23,797
- Mr. Kerrigan.
- Yeah. Yeah.

258
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:28,080
Mr. Kerrigan--

259
00:14:28,154 --> 00:14:31,314
Darryl, this is
a compulsory acquisition.

260
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:33,420
Yeah.

261
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:36,838
Mr. Kerrigan,
the airport is expanding.

262
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:39,593
They're setting up one of the largest
freight-handling facilities...

263
00:14:39,663 --> 00:14:42,922
in the Southern Hemisphere,
and they need a great deal of space.

264
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:45,374
Yeah.

265
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,788
And your house...
is on that space.

266
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:52,315
Yeah. Yeah,my house.

267
00:14:52,387 --> 00:14:54,719
That's right. Your house.

268
00:14:54,785 --> 00:14:56,822
That's why
you'll be duly compensated.

269
00:14:56,895 --> 00:15:00,950
No. No, you've missed the point.
I'm not interested in compensation.

270
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,221
I don't wanna go.

271
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:05,360
Under the laws
of compulsory acquisition--

272
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:08,941
and I don't necessarily
agree with those laws--

273
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:11,398
I can understand
the pain and trouble--

274
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:13,960
Would you stop pretending
to be on my side?

275
00:15:15,469 --> 00:15:18,020
All right, Mr. Kerrigan,
I'll state this simply.

276
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:19,946
There is
an ironclad agreement...

277
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:22,724
between federal, state
and local governments
and the Airports Commission.

278
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,644
Yeah?

279
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:28,928
Well, where's the agreement
with Darryl Kerrigan,
3 Highview Crescent, Coolaroo?

280
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:32,373
Where'sthat agreement?

281
00:15:32,446 --> 00:15:36,534
It's not gonna happen.

282
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:41,015
I don't know, Darryl.
This isn't my area.

283
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:44,151
What do you mean this is not your area?
This is law.

284
00:16:44,221 --> 00:16:46,553
Darryl, the airport
wants to buy your place.

285
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:50,525
Airports come under federal law.
Federal? I just do small stuff.

286
00:16:50,598 --> 00:16:52,458
Conveyancing, magistrates.

287
00:16:52,524 --> 00:16:55,249
- You defended Wayne.
- Yeah, and he got eight years.

288
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:58,642
Yeah, but you did your best.
I mean, you can hold your head up high.

289
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,896
He was the one that
held up the service station.

290
00:17:00,965 --> 00:17:03,942
- I don't know anything
about this sort of stuff.
- But they can't do this.

291
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:07,253
- I don't know. Maybe they can.
- They can't.

292
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,263
Look, I'll ring around
and I'll see what I can find out.

293
00:17:10,336 --> 00:17:12,897
Good on you, Dennis. Eh.

294
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:14,828
How is Wayne?

295
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:18,614
Good. Yeah, good.
Behaving himself.

296
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,892
- Any word?
- Nah, nah.

297
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,352
They reckon he's still
a couple of years off.

298
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:26,537
I'll let you know.

299
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:29,005
<i>But Dad was never one
to bring worries home.</i>

300
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:34,212
<i>Even in the down times he'd still
tell us funny stories about his day.</i>

301
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:38,087
It's a head-on between
a Geo and a Volksy.

302
00:17:38,162 --> 00:17:42,068
Dad also had a way
of making everyone feel important.

303
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:44,932
Come on, Dale.
Tell 'em.

304
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:48,587
Go on. Tell 'em.
Dale dug a hole.

305
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:51,349
- Like the time I dug a hole.
- Started the patio.

306
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:55,072
- Good on you, Dale.
- And he'd compliment Mum every
single night on her cooking.

307
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,861
Well, hello.
How's this, boys? Whoo-hoo!

308
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:01,324
- What do you call this?
- Chicken.

309
00:18:01,398 --> 00:18:04,539
- Yeah, but it's got something
sprinkled on it.
- Seasoning.

310
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:06,469
Seasoning.

311
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:09,258
Looks like everybody's
kicked a goal.

312
00:18:09,326 --> 00:18:11,186
How are our
backs feeling?

313
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:14,295
<i>Steve did get them
ergonometric chairs.</i>

314
00:18:14,364 --> 00:18:17,055
<i>And Mum had already
started prettying hers up.</i>

315
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:20,199
<i>Dad placed a great deal
of importance on mealtime.</i>

316
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,130
<i>He had
a very strict rule:</i>

317
00:18:22,195 --> 00:18:26,486
<i>When the family starts to eat,
the television is definitely
turned down.</i>

318
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:30,795
<i>But as soon as we've finished eating,
it's a different story.</i>

319
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,520
That was great.

320
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:36,445
Dad, 7:30.

321
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:39,617
All right,
time for some fun.

322
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:43,408
<i>Dad reckons there's only one show better
than Funniest Home Videos,</i>

323
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:46,232
<i>and that's The Best
of Funniest Home Videos.</i>

324
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:49,953
<i>It made Dad laugh. And when Dad laughed,
his whole body joined in.</i>

325
00:18:50,022 --> 00:18:51,970
<i>And then we would too.</i>

326
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:54,220
Doggy breath!

327
00:18:54,288 --> 00:18:58,776
<i>It was funny how on the fun nights,
part of me got sad,</i>

328
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,052
<i>'cause I'd think about
my big brother in prison
and wonder what he was doing.</i>

329
00:19:03,564 --> 00:19:05,960
<i>Wayne always reckoned
he was doing fine,</i>

330
00:19:06,037 --> 00:19:10,239
<i>but I get the feeling
he was missing us more
than he was letting on.</i>

331
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:12,865
<i>It'll be great
when he comes home.</i>

332
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:22,430
You're a ripper, Dennis.

333
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:26,735
I said you're
a bloody ripper!

334
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,193
Yeah, okay.

335
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:34,304
- That's it, Sal. All fixed.
- What did he say?

336
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:39,057
He said I have recourse
to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

337
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:42,451
All I gotta do is run
up there, put my case,
and they can go and get stuffed.

338
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:44,388
Good on you, darl.

339
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:47,211
- He still hasn't noticed, Mum.
- What?

340
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:50,997
- Oh, it's finished.
- Today.

341
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:54,073
How is that?
You should open a shop.

342
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:57,833
Dad, some guy's selling
an overhead projector.

343
00:19:57,901 --> 00:19:59,761
Nah--

344
00:19:59,826 --> 00:20:02,649
Nah, hang on, Steve.
What's he asking?

345
00:20:02,714 --> 00:20:06,019
- One-fifty.
- Tell him he's dreaming.

346
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:09,323
- Yeah.
- So what else
did Dennis have to say?

347
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:12,299
- Nothing. It's fixed.
- Yeah, but when's the hearing?

348
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,871
Monday. And I know exactly
what I'm gonna say.

349
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:18,400
- Don't babble on, darl.
- I don't babble on.
When do I babble on?

350
00:20:18,473 --> 00:20:21,197
- You do babble on.
- All right.

351
00:20:21,265 --> 00:20:24,087
But I tell you
what we're gonna do.

352
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:26,780
Friday we're gonna
pick up Trace and Con,

353
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:30,854
and then we're going straight up
to Bonnie Doon for the weekend.

354
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:35,094
And we're not worrying about
those clowns for another second.

355
00:20:35,162 --> 00:20:38,948
- Mum! Price is Right'son.
- All right, eh.

356
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:42,799
I'd better ring up Farouk and Jack
and Evonne and the others...

357
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:45,907
and tell 'em
what's going on.

358
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,699
<i>Trace and Con had
a great honeymoon in Thailand.</i>

359
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:58,589
<i>We met them as they came off
the plane with a baggage cart,</i>

360
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:01,477
<i>which was lucky 'cause
they had heaps of stuff.</i>

361
00:21:03,468 --> 00:21:06,674
<i>We couldn't wait to hear all
the stories about their trip,</i>

362
00:21:06,742 --> 00:21:09,084
<i>and we didn't have
to wait all that long either.</i>

363
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,874
<i>'Cause one of the good things
about living next to the airport...</i>

364
00:21:11,941 --> 00:21:14,282
<i>is that it doesn't
take long to walk home.</i>

365
00:21:24,523 --> 00:21:27,696
And they had these masks
which you put over your eyes
when you're sleeping...

366
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:29,624
so that you can't
see anything.

367
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:32,030
- And they were complimentary.
- Yeah, they were for free.

368
00:21:32,097 --> 00:21:34,076
<i>It was the first time
anyone in our family...</i>

369
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:36,011
<i>had traveled
outside the county.</i>

370
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:38,254
<i>And we just sat glued
listening to all the details.</i>

371
00:21:38,323 --> 00:21:40,948
Oh, Mum, we had a choice between fish
and Beef Wellington.

372
00:21:41,018 --> 00:21:43,710
- Beef Wellington?
- What's that, darl?

373
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,989
It's beef
done in pastry.

374
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:48,585
And it was an absolute
credit to the airline.

375
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:50,518
- Did they show a film?
- Two.

376
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:52,444
- Two?
- Yeah.

377
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:54,555
- And they also had--
- What were they?

378
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:57,636
- We saw Twister. And they had--
- Was it on a screen or a telly?

379
00:21:57,707 --> 00:22:01,613
Telly. And they had
easy listening, classic gold,
contemporary rock, world--

380
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,865
What was the other one,
the other film?

381
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:06,275
- Uh,Juman-- Jumanji, yeah.
-Jumanji.

382
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,259
- And with the headphones--
- Which one was first?

383
00:22:09,324 --> 00:22:11,646
- Twister. You could
turn the sound all--
- How many on the way back?

384
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,513
- Dale! You can ask all this later.
- Sorry, Trace.

385
00:22:14,578 --> 00:22:17,595
It was so dry in the plane
that your hair actually dehydrates.

386
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:21,539
- Doesn't it, Con?
- It loses its moisture.
- It's so interesting.

387
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:23,189
<i>We could have
listened for hours,</i>

388
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,428
<i>but then it
was presents time.</i>

389
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:28,589
For you, Dad. It's a samurai sword
letter opener.

390
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:30,692
That is handcrafted.

391
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:34,292
How's that, love?
That is just--

392
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,738
This is going straight
to the poolroom.

393
00:22:36,812 --> 00:22:39,005
You should use it, Dad.

394
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:42,025
This I am not even taking
out of the wrapper.

395
00:22:42,098 --> 00:22:46,547
<i>They bought Mum a genuine Rolex
for 15 bucks off a guy at the beach.</i>

396
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:48,747
<i>He said he'd mail
the warranty later.</i>

397
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:52,918
<i>I got a necklace with a shark tooth.
They got a Walkman for Steve.</i>

398
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:56,265
<i>'Cause it was Friday,
I told Trace I'd take
Wayne's present to him.</i>

399
00:22:56,329 --> 00:22:59,280
<i>It was an elephant,
'cause elephants bring good luck,</i>

400
00:22:59,353 --> 00:23:01,957
<i>especially if the trunks are up,
and his trunk was up.</i>

401
00:23:02,983 --> 00:23:05,718
<i>It really made Wayne's day.</i>

402
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,519
- She's great, isn't she? Trace.
- Yeah.

403
00:23:08,585 --> 00:23:11,884
It brings good luck.
She's coming in on Monday.

404
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,533
Great. And when's Dad going in
to do that hearing?

405
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:16,449
- On Monday.
- Yeah?

406
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:20,898
- Yeah. He reckons they can't do it.
- Dad would know.

407
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:25,040
- You going up to
Bonnie Doon tonight?
- Yeah. Maybe. I don't know.

408
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:28,289
<i>I didn't want to tell Wayne
that we were going to Bonnie Doon,</i>

409
00:23:28,355 --> 00:23:31,156
<i>just in case he'd feel bad
that we were going to Bonnie Doon.</i>

410
00:23:31,221 --> 00:23:34,769
<i>He liked it there.
We all liked it there.</i>

411
00:23:34,904 --> 00:23:37,713
* We're going to Bonnie Doon *

412
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:40,667
<i>We all left soon after,
except for Trace and Con.</i>

413
00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:44,202
<i>As you can just imagine,
they were just married and
wanted some time to themselves.</i>

414
00:23:44,274 --> 00:23:46,434
<i>So they drove up
in their own car.</i>

415
00:23:46,503 --> 00:23:49,237
<i>Dad had a song he used to sing
about going to Bonnie Doon.</i>

416
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:52,256
<i>Only he sang it a lot,
and it was a bit repetitive.</i>

417
00:23:52,328 --> 00:23:54,173
Darl!

418
00:23:59,884 --> 00:24:02,521
- Dad, radar!

419
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,905
- How much did that cost?
- Seventy bucks.

420
00:24:12,037 --> 00:24:14,351
Just paid for itself.

421
00:24:16,229 --> 00:24:18,769
Dale, why don't you
unload the boat, Mate?

422
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:21,839
Steve, don't forget
the dog food, pal.

423
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:29,663
Hey, boy. Hey!

424
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:34,252
- Bloody marvelous to be
up here, isn't it, Dale?
- Yeah.

425
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,283
- Bonnie Doon.
- Dad loved Bonnie Doon.

426
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,552
<i>How do I describe it?</i>

427
00:24:38,763 --> 00:24:40,956
<i>It is a little town
on a big lake.</i>

428
00:24:41,024 --> 00:24:45,540
<i>It's a beautiful place,
especially this time of year
when the water levels are down.</i>

429
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,181
<i>Dad could not believe his luck
when he found this place.</i>

430
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:50,575
<i>It was a bargain,
and he couldn't work out why.</i>

431
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:53,526
<i>It was just a block of land
with a beautiful view.</i>

432
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,270
<i>It took him five years
to build this place.</i>

433
00:24:56,338 --> 00:24:58,910
<i>He bought an unfinished kit home
out of the Trading Post,</i>

434
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,279
<i>built it in the backyard
and towed it up here with his truck.</i>

435
00:25:02,355 --> 00:25:04,677
<i>He was the only bloke
he knew with a holiday home.</i>

436
00:25:04,743 --> 00:25:06,805
<i>Not a mobile home,
a holiday home.</i>

437
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,350
<i>And he reckoned we were
the luckiest family in the world.</i>

438
00:25:09,422 --> 00:25:13,948
- Dale, I reckon we're the luckiest
family in the world. - Yeah.

439
00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:14,991
<i>He loved the serenity of the place.</i>

440
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:16,996
How's the serenity?

441
00:25:17,135 --> 00:25:19,244
<i>I think he also just loved the word.</i>

442
00:25:19,373 --> 00:25:21,497
So much serenity.

443
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,899
Let's get to bed.
Tomorrow is going to be a great day.

444
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,631
Yeah.

445
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:33,309
<i>If there's one thing
Dad loved more than serenity,</i>

446
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,856
<i>it was an outboard motor
on full throttle.</i>

447
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:46,043
Listen to that!
Singing like a bird!

448
00:25:46,114 --> 00:25:49,384
<i>He just loved Bonnie Doon,
and he reckoned the faster you went,</i>

449
00:25:49,384 --> 00:25:50,618
<i>the more you saw of it.</i>

450
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:51,619
Look at that!

451
00:25:52,187 --> 00:25:55,238
- What?
- Back there.

452
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:59,316
<i>But eventually he found a place
he reckoned looked like a good spot.</i>

453
00:25:59,317 --> 00:26:01,706
I reckon this looks like a good spot.

454
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,747
<i>Dad loved fishing. And he really
looked after his equipment.</i>

455
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,721
<i>He said they only made on good rod.
It's called the 'Ugly Stick'
by Shakespeare.</i>

456
00:26:09,866 --> 00:26:13,985
<i>It's so strong, you can bend it
right around on itself.</i>

457
00:26:13,986 --> 00:26:17,284
Look at that.
Bends right around on itself.

458
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:21,336
<i>The lake had trout,
redfin and carp.</i>

459
00:26:21,407 --> 00:26:24,275
<i>The carp was not a good eating fish,
but it was good catching.</i>

460
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:26,184
<i>They could grow
to quite a size.</i>

461
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:29,560
<i>Genuinely, that just hooked himself.
But occasionally Dad went crafty,
just nibbling at the bait.</i>

462
00:26:31,162 --> 00:26:32,362
- Got a nibble.

463
00:26:32,732 --> 00:26:36,800
<i>Dad reckoned that fishing
was 10 percent brains
and 95 percent muscle...</i>

464
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,040
<i>and the rest
was just good luck.</i>

465
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:45,696
<i>We all got a few carp that day,
and each of us know how to muscle fish.</i>

466
00:26:49,995 --> 00:26:52,196
- Where's Con?
- Down the shops.

467
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:54,309
You and Con talked about kids yet?

468
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:57,231
Yeah – Con wants to start
straightaway.

469
00:26:57,232 --> 00:26:58,853
But, you know,
I've got a career.

470
00:26:58,854 --> 00:27:00,043
Of course.

471
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:02,705
So, I said I'm not having kids
until I'm at least 23.

472
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:04,568
Times have changed.

473
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,935
- Gail had a boy.
- Was he a whopper?

474
00:27:20,936 --> 00:27:23,933
Mmm, 10 pounds. They're gonna
be a big beefy family.

475
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:28,172
Tyler Jay. Even the birth notice
was big – stork and everything.

476
00:27:28,173 --> 00:27:30,591
Shannon was nine pounds. - Mmm.
- What did you make then?

477
00:27:30,592 --> 00:27:33,420
Oh, I knitted a pair of bootees.
You always need bootees.

478
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:36,591
- I reckon you should make
fake flowers. - Oh, yeah.

479
00:27:36,845 --> 00:27:38,639
- Jenny makes fake flowers.
- Jenny?

480
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,859
- Yeah.
- Jenny Jenny?

481
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,017
No, microwave Jenny. She reckons
the trick is to make 'em real

482
00:27:42,018 --> 00:27:44,908
but not too real, just real enough
to know that they're fake.

483
00:27:45,782 --> 00:27:48,556
- I'd like to do pottery.
- Wow! On a wheel?

484
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,063
Yeah. I just love mugs.

485
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,646
Yeah, I'd like
to make my own mugs.

486
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,376
- Mum...
- Yeah?

487
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:57,937
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

488
00:27:58,972 --> 00:28:00,132
- You worried about the house?
- No.

489
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:04,799
- Dad said everything's
gonna be OK.
- Of course it is, darl.

490
00:28:10,284 --> 00:28:13,380
We ended up with four carp
and one redfin –

491
00:28:13,449 --> 00:28:17,885
a reasonable day's fishing,
considering we had to get back
earlier when Coco got seasick.

492
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:20,508
Steve wasn't looking
all that flash either.

493
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:28,219
Keep it still, Trace.

494
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,863
Disciplined,
isn't he, Sal?

495
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:37,811
Here are you and I relaxing,
having a beer, and he's still training.

496
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:40,263
Yeah, he just loves
that sport.

497
00:28:40,337 --> 00:28:43,847
- Well, you gotta have
a passion for something.
- Yeah.

498
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:49,763
How's the serenity?

499
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:55,512
Dad! Where do you want me to put
the chicken coop?

500
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:58,007
Up the back, Steve.

501
00:29:00,384 --> 00:29:03,828
45 bucks. You couldn't buy
the materials for that.

502
00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:06,766
Now, what do you want
with a chicken coop?

503
00:29:06,842 --> 00:29:09,173
And what do we want
with a kit home?

504
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:12,683
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

505
00:29:12,756 --> 00:29:15,982
Now, give me a kiss,
you big hunk of a man.

506
00:29:49,742 --> 00:29:53,706
Marvellous, ain't it?
The lake, the kids.

507
00:29:57,737 --> 00:30:01,027
Oh, look at the dogs!
Don't they love it?

508
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:05,856
Oh, smell that!

509
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,212
- Two-stroke.
- Yep.

510
00:30:11,412 --> 00:30:13,680
Pity Wayne can't be here.

511
00:30:13,746 --> 00:30:17,190
- Darl.
- No, no, I could've done better.

512
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:22,178
Well, let's start
cooking this feast.

513
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,116
- Who ordered medium rare?
- Me.

514
00:30:25,192 --> 00:30:27,045
Good stuff.

515
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,725
Check that, Steve.
It could be a little underdone.

516
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:34,134
- I bet they don't have places
like this in Thailand, Con.
- No, Mr. Kerrigan.

517
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,052
Hey, hey, hey.
"Darryl" now, mate.

518
00:30:37,116 --> 00:30:39,318
Sorry, Darryl.

519
00:30:39,386 --> 00:30:43,092
- It's a good place, though.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm curious.

520
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,410
Now, I know it's unfair
to compare anyplace to Bonnie Doon,

521
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:49,807
but why would I want to go there
instead of here?

522
00:30:49,873 --> 00:30:52,685
- It's for young people, Dad.
- I know that, Trace.

523
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,260
- It's the culture, Darryl.
The place is full of culture.
- Chockers.

524
00:30:56,331 --> 00:30:58,184
- Oh, yeah.
- Something for everyone.

525
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,419
- What was that movie again, Con?
- Dale.

526
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:02,340
There were so many stories.

527
00:31:02,405 --> 00:31:04,738
At the hotel
Trace and I were staying in,
they had this one channel:

528
00:31:04,803 --> 00:31:07,223
kickboxing, 24 hours a day.

529
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:11,185
It was just so interesting
to hear about another county.

530
00:31:11,186 --> 00:31:14,347
Meals were 5 dollars, mum –
the most beautiful satays.

531
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:15,145
What's that, darl?

532
00:31:15,146 --> 00:31:18,486
It's meat on a skewer with
peanut sauce and grilled.

533
00:31:18,498 --> 00:31:21,081
And the stories
went on and on all night.

534
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:24,456
The value for money is
absolutely second to none.

535
00:31:24,457 --> 00:31:26,996
- One of the other Sony Walkmans...
- With presets?

536
00:31:26,997 --> 00:31:31,166
Yeah, presets AND megabass –
$85 Australian.

537
00:31:31,497 --> 00:31:33,195
- Wow!
- Bargain? - Shit yeah!

538
00:31:34,588 --> 00:31:37,374
But I reckon someone like you, Steve,
could have got him down even further.

539
00:31:38,421 --> 00:31:40,296
I can't wait to go to Bangkok.

540
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,951
- It's great to have you two back.
- It's great to be back.

541
00:31:44,442 --> 00:31:46,830
Great to be up here.

542
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:50,611
They haven't got
a place like this in Bangkok.

543
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:52,976
How's the serenity?

544
00:31:54,578 --> 00:31:56,431
Not a sound.

545
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,571
<i>On Monday morning Dad
was chomping at the bit.</i>

546
00:32:08,581 --> 00:32:11,644
- Feeling good, Sal.
- Good on you, darl.

547
00:32:11,714 --> 00:32:13,883
Steve, could you move
the Corolla?

548
00:32:13,952 --> 00:32:16,284
I need to get to the Torana out
so I can get to the Commodore.

549
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,682
I'll have to get the keys
to the Cortina if I'm going
to move that Corolla.

550
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:21,079
- Watch the boat, mate.
- Yeah.

551
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:23,565
- Know why I'm feeling good, Sal?
- Why?

552
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:27,410
I'll tell you why.
Because this is an example
of the individual.

553
00:32:27,475 --> 00:32:30,124
Of how the individual,
if he has the guts to stand up...

554
00:32:30,194 --> 00:32:33,387
and shove it right up
those people who think
they can stand on top of you.

555
00:32:33,454 --> 00:32:36,680
The people who think
they can do that, that's why.

556
00:32:41,863 --> 00:32:43,803
What do you mean
what's my plea?

557
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:46,287
- What is the case you are putting?
- I told you.

558
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:49,385
I mean, you just can't walk in
and take a man's house.

559
00:32:49,456 --> 00:32:52,268
Mr. Kerrigan, are you disputing
the amount of compensation?

560
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:56,998
I'm not interested in compensation.
I'm saying that you can't kick me out.

561
00:32:57,064 --> 00:32:59,266
Very well.

562
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:01,699
- What is your argument?
- That's it.

563
00:33:01,764 --> 00:33:05,439
That's my argument.
You can't kick me out.

564
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:09,331
And on what law do you base
that argument?

565
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:12,818
- The law
of bloody common sense!
- Mr. Kerrigan.

566
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,335
- I must ask you
to restrain yourself.
- Yeah, all right.

567
00:33:16,407 --> 00:33:20,659
Mr. Kerrigan, this is
the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

568
00:33:20,724 --> 00:33:23,917
You are an applicant.
You need to show--

569
00:33:23,984 --> 00:33:27,559
I need to show?
So it's up to me, is it?

570
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:31,139
Mr. Kerrigan, Air Link,
as a federal authority,

571
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,793
has the right to purchase property
compulsorily.

572
00:33:33,864 --> 00:33:38,463
And, as far as I can see,
you have offered no evidence
to refute that right.

573
00:33:38,532 --> 00:33:40,472
No evidence?

574
00:33:40,545 --> 00:33:45,015
It's not a house. It's a home.
A man's home is his castle.

575
00:33:45,085 --> 00:33:49,838
I mean, it's-- it's--
it's Jack's castle.
It's Farou-Farouk's castle.

576
00:33:49,912 --> 00:33:52,180
You just can't walk in
and steal our homes.

577
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:55,059
- You will be compensated.
- I don't wanna be compensated.

578
00:33:55,124 --> 00:33:57,456
You can't buy
what I've got.

579
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,253
Mr. Kerrigan, I am rapidly
running out of patience.

580
00:34:02,318 --> 00:34:05,828
- You're running out of patience.
- What is your case in law?

581
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:10,149
Well, okay, um,

582
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:15,130
the law is supposed
to be about justice-- no, fairness.

583
00:34:15,202 --> 00:34:20,150
And I know that sometimes
what is right and fair is
not clear-cut. It's a bit iffy.

584
00:34:20,222 --> 00:34:25,072
But this is not iffy.
I mean, this is as clear as day.

585
00:34:25,144 --> 00:34:30,093
It is right and fair
that a family be allowed
to live in its own house.

586
00:34:30,164 --> 00:34:32,464
That is justice.

587
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:36,455
I rest my case.

588
00:34:38,572 --> 00:34:42,213
<i>Dad reckoned he'd nailed it.
Farouk agreed.</i>

589
00:34:44,902 --> 00:34:47,453
<i>But Dad was wrong.</i>

590
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:52,310
I can't believe I lost.
I've let you down.

591
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:55,676
No, no, Mr. Kerrigan.
You do good job.

592
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,804
- Please, Farouk, call me Darryl.
- Okay, Mr. Darryl.

593
00:34:58,874 --> 00:35:01,870
But, you know, I never heard that one
you say before.

594
00:35:01,943 --> 00:35:05,103
"A man's home is his castle."
Well, that's an old saying.

595
00:35:05,172 --> 00:35:09,358
No, no. Other one. Other one.
"Is not house, is home."

596
00:35:09,424 --> 00:35:12,357
Farouk, I lost.

597
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,948
I know, Mr. Darryl.

598
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:17,537
Farouk, how much
are they paying you?

599
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:20,672
- $65,000.
- For your place?

600
00:35:20,742 --> 00:35:24,961
Yes. They say the plane,
they fly overhead, drop the value.

601
00:35:25,026 --> 00:35:28,852
I don't care. In Beirut,
plane fly overhead, drop bomb.

602
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:32,982
- I like this plane.
- What are we going to do, Darryl?

603
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:34,936
I don't know, Jack.

604
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:38,708
This is the only place I can afford.
I don't wanna move.

605
00:35:38,774 --> 00:35:40,627
You see what
they're doing, Sal?

606
00:35:40,692 --> 00:35:42,763
Mm.

607
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:46,343
- How long you lived here, Jack?
- Three years.

608
00:35:46,414 --> 00:35:49,826
Now, in the area.
How long have you lived around here?

609
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:51,905
Fifty-seven years.

610
00:35:51,978 --> 00:35:55,357
Fifty-seven years.

611
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:59,486
And they're gonna
kick you out on your ass.

612
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:03,741
Well, bugger 'em.
I'm not giving up, Jack.

613
00:36:03,807 --> 00:36:08,059
If they wanna play things by the law,
fine. We'll play by the law.

614
00:36:08,123 --> 00:36:10,968
But they're not
the only big guns in town.

615
00:36:11,033 --> 00:36:15,306
If it's gonna be lawyers, I'm gonna
hit them with the big artillery.

616
00:36:15,412 --> 00:36:19,686
Hang on, Darryl.
Jesus, these fucking photocopiers.

617
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,573
What the fuck is that?
I cleared tray three.

618
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,491
Why don't you get your girl
to do that for you?

619
00:36:24,556 --> 00:36:28,545
She's not here on Mondays.
She does Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.

620
00:36:28,616 --> 00:36:31,264
F-3. What the fuck
is that?

621
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:33,471
- Dennis, how did it go?
- Not good.

622
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:37,311
I spoke to every barrister I know.
No one wants to touch it.

623
00:36:37,376 --> 00:36:39,611
All right. You do it.

624
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:42,065
I told you, Darryl,
I'm not qualified.

625
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,399
You're not qualified?
Now I've heard everything.

626
00:36:45,466 --> 00:36:47,535
What do you mean
you're not qualified?

627
00:36:47,607 --> 00:36:49,874
I mean I'm not
in the big time.

628
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,848
You have lost faith
in yourself, Dennis.

629
00:36:51,924 --> 00:36:54,604
- Darryl--
- You have lost faith.

630
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:58,466
Darryl, it's over my head.
It's over your head too.

631
00:36:58,541 --> 00:37:02,312
Over my head? Dennis.

632
00:37:02,378 --> 00:37:05,375
- Darryl, have you heard
of the Barlow Group?
-No.

633
00:37:05,447 --> 00:37:08,827
It's basically a big investment company
controlled by three blokes...

634
00:37:08,899 --> 00:37:10,752
worth about
a half a billion each.

635
00:37:10,817 --> 00:37:13,270
Well, the Barlow Group
is Air Link.

636
00:37:13,343 --> 00:37:15,480
I thought Air Link
was the government.

637
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:19,507
It's a government authority,
but all the money's coming from Barlow.

638
00:37:19,577 --> 00:37:23,982
It's a way of privatizing
without privatizing.
Anyway, it's a big, big thing.

639
00:37:24,054 --> 00:37:26,920
Every level of government.
Huge investment.

640
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,992
All right, fine.
So they're big.

641
00:37:30,064 --> 00:37:31,972
But why do they
wantmy house?

642
00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:35,305
Why don't they just fill in
the old quarry and build it there?

643
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:38,270
I don't know. Maybe it's just cheaper
to pull down more houses.

644
00:37:38,345 --> 00:37:42,847
- So we fight 'em.
- Darryl, they want this thing to work.

645
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:47,670
- They're gonna get their way.
- And you know why people
like that get their way?

646
00:37:47,744 --> 00:37:51,037
Because people like us
don't stand up to 'em.

647
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:53,204
Now, they've still
gotta play by the rules.

648
00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:57,101
Darryl, they write the rules.
They own the game.

649
00:37:57,175 --> 00:38:00,946
Fuck, Dennis. It's my fucking house.
You're not gonna run scared on me.

650
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,558
I can't do this by myself.

651
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:07,306
All right, mate.

652
00:38:07,374 --> 00:38:09,990
Let me think about it.

653
00:38:14,535 --> 00:38:18,591
- Con's working late tonight.
- He's just so busy.

654
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:21,473
I cannot believe
this postcard arrived today.

655
00:38:21,538 --> 00:38:23,543
Thanks
for dropping in.

656
00:38:23,616 --> 00:38:25,620
How's he treating
my princess?

657
00:38:25,693 --> 00:38:27,546
Dad!

658
00:38:27,612 --> 00:38:30,326
All right,
all right.

659
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:33,260
You saw
some amazing things.

660
00:38:33,335 --> 00:38:35,886
Now, that is
a bloody big statue.

661
00:38:35,956 --> 00:38:39,085
- Yeah, and it's all made of gold.
- Is that so?

662
00:38:41,424 --> 00:38:43,723
This bloke's
gonna win the cars.

663
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,950
- How's the salon?
- Good.

664
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:48,872
And look at these models.

665
00:38:48,937 --> 00:38:53,188
They've got ripper bodies,
but they let themselves down
in the hair department.

666
00:38:53,252 --> 00:38:56,958
You ought to contact
Channel Nine, get
a contract with them.

667
00:38:57,025 --> 00:38:59,128
Dad, it doesn't work
like that.

668
00:38:59,198 --> 00:39:03,570
Well, look at them and look at you.
Now, that is a head of hair.

669
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:06,455
- Just beautiful.
- Thanks, Dad.

670
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,460
I'm only stating
the truth.

671
00:39:08,535 --> 00:39:11,184
Dad, what's a pulpit?

672
00:39:11,252 --> 00:39:15,406
Where the minister gives
his sermon from. How much?

673
00:39:15,472 --> 00:39:19,113
- Eight hundred.
- Dreaming.

674
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:22,310
Actually, I know how
to get you on there.

675
00:39:22,378 --> 00:39:26,400
- Send in a photo of you
for the home viewers.
- Dad, if you dare.

676
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:29,915
- Oh, I've got quite a few lying around.
- Dad!

677
00:39:29,987 --> 00:39:33,465
Actually, I think I've got one taken
when you were two...

678
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:35,388
and you didn't have
any clothes on.

679
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:37,306
Dad! Don't you--

680
00:39:37,372 --> 00:39:40,086
- Quite a few to choose from there.
- Don't-- No!

681
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,534
<i>That night I thought of Wayne again.</i>

682
00:39:47,603 --> 00:39:50,982
<i>I wondered what he was doing
and whether the elephant's
trunk was still up.</i>

683
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,909
<i>'Cause that
brings good luck.</i>

684
00:40:06,115 --> 00:40:07,968
So, in conclusion,

685
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:11,510
my client will be appealing the decision
to the federal court...

686
00:40:11,582 --> 00:40:15,801
and, as an interim, will
be seeking an injunction...

687
00:40:15,866 --> 00:40:19,474
to stop any further action
in this matter.

688
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,354
Sincerely, Dennis Denuto.

689
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:55,469
Hammersley and Laycock.
May I help you?

690
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,580
Yes, putting you through now.

691
00:41:01,775 --> 00:41:05,994
I'm afraid he can't come
to the phone right now, Farouk.
He's up in the ceiling.

692
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:10,877
All right, I'll get him
to give you a call
as soon as he comes down.

693
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:14,526
Okay. Oh, give my love to Taboulah.

694
00:41:14,595 --> 00:41:16,535
- Good-bye.
- Shit!

695
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,803
Steve!

696
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:22,771
- Yeah?
- The beams aren't supporting.

697
00:41:22,844 --> 00:41:26,256
- I reckon we put a hold
on the mezzanine.
- Yeah, all right.

698
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:30,929
But I'll have to give that guy a
call about the spiral staircase
'cause he's holding it for us.

699
00:41:30,997 --> 00:41:34,092
- Darl, can you give Farouk a ring?
- Yeah.

700
00:41:34,162 --> 00:41:37,095
- Where's Dad?
- Up in the roof.

701
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:39,881
- Dad!
- Yeah, mate?

702
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:45,029
I dug another hole.
It's filling with water.

703
00:42:00,044 --> 00:42:04,861
You are fucking kidding me.
I cleared that tray three fucking times!

704
00:42:04,935 --> 00:42:07,105
- Mr. Denuto.
- Yeah?

705
00:42:07,173 --> 00:42:10,018
Ron Graham, Hammersley and Laycock.
Got your note during the week.

706
00:42:10,082 --> 00:42:15,032
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Um, sit down.

707
00:42:18,427 --> 00:42:22,035
Now, the Kerrigan matter.

708
00:42:23,414 --> 00:42:26,062
Well, we're going
to be taking it further.

709
00:42:26,132 --> 00:42:30,568
Yes, we totally understand,
and we're here on behalf
of our client to apologize.

710
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,711
- We made a mistake.
- You have?

711
00:42:32,781 --> 00:42:37,382
Yes, it appears that the house
belonging to Mr. Kerrigan was
grossly undervalued by mistake,

712
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:39,684
and our client would like
to rectify the situation.

713
00:42:39,751 --> 00:42:43,609
- Well, what are you offering?
- Another $25,000.

714
00:42:43,683 --> 00:42:46,070
- Whoa.
- As a separate cash check.

715
00:42:46,145 --> 00:42:49,273
You know, Darryl, my client,

716
00:42:49,342 --> 00:42:52,536
is disputing
the compulsory purchase.

717
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:55,154
Yes, though with
the correct valuation,

718
00:42:55,226 --> 00:42:57,395
we thought this may put
the dispute to rest.

719
00:42:57,463 --> 00:42:59,435
What if it doesn't?

720
00:43:00,692 --> 00:43:02,545
If I were you,

721
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,325
I would advise Mr. Kerrigan
against taking any further action.

722
00:43:05,392 --> 00:43:07,397
This is
a multi-billion dollar project.

723
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:09,889
It's been in planning
for a long time.

724
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:14,237
If this action were to delay
or spoil the plans,

725
00:43:14,313 --> 00:43:18,335
the understandable anger
could well spill into something else.

726
00:43:18,404 --> 00:43:21,019
- Are you threatening?
- Hang on.

727
00:43:21,089 --> 00:43:24,599
I just came in here,
apologized and increased
the offer by $25,000.

728
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:28,311
- I'm sorry.
- And that offer should
be put to Mr. Kerrigan...

729
00:43:28,379 --> 00:43:31,060
with your strongest
possible recommendation.

730
00:43:34,198 --> 00:43:36,530
Tell 'em to get stuffed.

731
00:43:36,596 --> 00:43:40,454
- It's $25,000, Darryl.
- Don't you get this, Dennis?

732
00:43:40,528 --> 00:43:43,209
Darryl, they're
offering 25 grand extra.

733
00:43:43,277 --> 00:43:47,169
Dennis, this is not about money.
I am not leaving my house.

734
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:49,476
- Tell 'em I'm not moving.
- They're not gonna be happy.

735
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:53,337
- Who cares?
- I mean, they're
gonna be really unhappy.

736
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:58,011
- So what are you telling me, Dennis?
- Nothing, Darryl.

737
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,347
- Did they threaten you?
- Not me, really.

738
00:44:00,414 --> 00:44:02,713
- They threatened me.
- Not exactly. They just said--

739
00:44:02,779 --> 00:44:05,395
- They fucking well threatened me.
- They just said--

740
00:44:05,465 --> 00:44:10,479
I want you to get on that phone
right now and tell 'em where
they can shove their 25 grand.

741
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:13,066
Darryl, " them"
is the Barlow Group,

742
00:44:13,138 --> 00:44:15,046
people used
to getting their way.

743
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:17,420
Now, they want
to expand the airport,

744
00:44:17,486 --> 00:44:19,754
and there's one bloke
who's a pain in the ass.

745
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,232
Tell 'em to get stuffed.

746
00:44:33,152 --> 00:44:35,060
More, darling?

747
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:38,960
Oh, no. No, love. That was beautiful.
What do you call that?

748
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:41,137
lce cream.

749
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:45,296
Yeah, but what you've done with it.
What did you do to it?

750
00:44:45,365 --> 00:44:48,329
Scooped it out of the tub.

751
00:44:48,402 --> 00:44:50,571
Did I do the right thing?

752
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,419
Oh, yes, sweetheart,
you did the right thing.

753
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:56,614
- Twenty-five grand, Dad.
- Yeah, but not that way, Steve.

754
00:44:56,683 --> 00:44:58,852
We're not gonna
take the money.

755
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:04,766
- I want to tell you a story.
- Oh, good.

756
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:07,134
- About how your father and I met.
- I know this one.

757
00:45:07,201 --> 00:45:09,054
Not all of it, Dale.

758
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,036
You see, I used to go out
with a very handsome young man,

759
00:45:14,106 --> 00:45:16,177
well-to-do,
called Bob Thompson.

760
00:45:16,249 --> 00:45:19,660
Big Bob Thompson.
What's he doing now, eh?

761
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:21,706
Putting in fence posts
in the country.

762
00:45:21,779 --> 00:45:24,166
- He runs a construction company.
- So he says.

763
00:45:24,242 --> 00:45:27,054
Well, anyway, one night he took me
to the greyhounds.

764
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,945
- He put on a real show.
We ate at the carvery.
- What did you have?

765
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,926
Uh, pork.

766
00:45:33,001 --> 00:45:35,551
Anyway, we had wine, champagne.

767
00:45:35,623 --> 00:45:38,783
He put on all my bets,
and he was just sweeping me off my feet.

768
00:45:38,852 --> 00:45:42,198
And I wouldn't have
been at all surprised
if he'd popped the question.

769
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:45,269
Well, anyway, later on--
I don't know what it was--

770
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:49,114
But out of the corner of my eye
I spotted this lanky bloke...

771
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,414
- struggling with one of his greyhounds.
- Red Rocket.

772
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:55,568
- That's you, Dad.
- Now, Bob, he went off to talk
to one of the stewards.

773
00:45:55,637 --> 00:45:59,179
And this young fella,
he comes right up to me
and starts chatting to me...

774
00:45:59,249 --> 00:46:01,255
and he asks me out.

775
00:46:01,327 --> 00:46:04,936
And I said,
"Well, I'm on a date."

776
00:46:05,004 --> 00:46:08,035
Well, he backed right off.

777
00:46:08,106 --> 00:46:12,706
He said he wasn't cutting
anyone's lunch,
and he wished me good night.

778
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:16,893
And I thought,
"That man has principles."

779
00:46:16,961 --> 00:46:21,627
And from that day on,
I've only had eyes for one man.

780
00:46:21,694 --> 00:46:24,147
Hook, line and sinker.

781
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:27,893
And that's what I love about him:
his principles.

782
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:30,608
So we're not taking
the money, Steve.

783
00:46:30,677 --> 00:46:34,154
Hang on. I'll get it.

784
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,080
What was the carvery like?

785
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,464
- Yeah?
- Mr. Kerrigan.

786
00:46:43,529 --> 00:46:46,145
- Yeah? What?
- I've just got a message to pass on.

787
00:46:46,215 --> 00:46:48,798
- From who?
- I'm just passing on a message.

788
00:46:48,868 --> 00:46:51,549
- Are you from the council?
- No, I'm not from the council.

789
00:46:51,618 --> 00:46:54,430
- The company.
- I'm just passing on
a message, Mr. Kerrigan.

790
00:46:54,495 --> 00:46:56,665
They always send
someone different, don't they?

791
00:46:56,732 --> 00:47:00,307
The message is,
"Take the offer and shut up."
Understood?

792
00:47:00,377 --> 00:47:02,612
- Are you threatening me?
- I'm just passing on a message.

793
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,066
- Fuck off, you clown! Fuck off!
- Mr. Kerrigan--

794
00:47:05,142 --> 00:47:07,441
- You better watch your mouth, pal.
- You heard my dad.

795
00:47:07,507 --> 00:47:10,571
- Now, fuck off!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Fine.

796
00:47:10,641 --> 00:47:13,387
I'm just trying
to tell you.

797
00:47:16,874 --> 00:47:19,556
And what the fuck do you think
you're doing?

798
00:47:19,624 --> 00:47:22,011
You know what I said after Wayne.
No more guns in the house.

799
00:47:22,086 --> 00:47:24,255
- Yeah, but he was threatening you.
- Where did you get it?

800
00:47:24,324 --> 00:47:26,558
- Trading Post.
- And what did you pay for it?

801
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:29,470
- One-eighty.
- What was he asking?

802
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,948
- Two-fifty.
- He was dreaming.

803
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,433
- Yeah.
- Get rid of it.

804
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:40,308
Sell it.

805
00:47:58,597 --> 00:48:00,929
Pricks!

806
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:07,411
All right. All right.

807
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:10,352
I might pass on
a message of my own.

808
00:48:23,054 --> 00:48:27,425
Don't bullshit me, pal.
I know why you want Highview Crescent.

809
00:48:27,498 --> 00:48:30,495
It's because you're
too much of a tight-ass
to fill in the quarry.

810
00:48:30,568 --> 00:48:34,078
It's easier to knock down
people's houses than it
is to fill in a hole.

811
00:48:34,149 --> 00:48:36,056
Well, what do
you say to that?

812
00:48:36,131 --> 00:48:38,016
Get off my property
or I'll call the police.

813
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:41,307
Fuck the police! You're the asshole
who had my car smashed!

814
00:48:41,374 --> 00:48:43,957
Settle down, mate.
Settle down.

815
00:48:44,028 --> 00:48:46,611
It's just what
he wants us to do.

816
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:52,879
Let's just keep our cool.
We don't wanna do anything stupid.

817
00:49:20,538 --> 00:49:23,732
- Darryl John Kerrigan?
- You know who I am, Mick.

818
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:26,414
- Darryl John Kerrigan.
- Yes, officer?

819
00:49:26,485 --> 00:49:29,864
Were you on Lansell Road,
Toorak at approximately
2:30 this morning?

820
00:49:29,937 --> 00:49:33,578
- No.
- Is there anyone who can verify
your whereabouts at that hour?

821
00:49:33,647 --> 00:49:37,897
Yeah, yeah. Everyone in this house.
While we've still got it.

822
00:49:37,963 --> 00:49:41,788
- Daz, I know you did it.
- I told you, mate.
I don't know anything--

823
00:49:41,862 --> 00:49:45,056
- Shut up. I'm not going to book you.
This is just a warning.

824
00:49:45,123 --> 00:49:48,895
I know what's going on.
No one wants to see you get
the rough end of the stick,

825
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,130
but you're gonna have
to watch yourself.

826
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,683
- Otherwise, you'll end up losing more
than this house.
- Mick.

827
00:49:53,756 --> 00:49:57,713
Darryl, I've seen it happen, mate.
Now, settle down.

828
00:49:57,785 --> 00:50:01,937
If you wanna take 'em on,
do it the right way. By the book.

829
00:50:02,004 --> 00:50:05,262
- All right, Mick.
- Oh, and, uh, Daz?

830
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:08,838
- Yeah?
- Put them gates around the back.

831
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:10,763
Oh.

832
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:20,284
Now, listen.
Things are gettin' a bit serious.

833
00:50:20,355 --> 00:50:24,444
Last night I had a visit
from some hired thug.

834
00:50:24,511 --> 00:50:27,443
- Yeah, me too.
-What do you mean, you too?

835
00:50:27,517 --> 00:50:31,442
A man, he come to my house and he say,
"Stop with the court business."

836
00:50:31,513 --> 00:50:34,065
If no stop, he have friend
who come and beat me.

837
00:50:34,135 --> 00:50:36,555
And I say,
"You have friend, I have friend.

838
00:50:36,629 --> 00:50:39,855
My friend come to your house,
put bomb under your car
and blow you to fucking sky."

839
00:50:39,922 --> 00:50:42,821
- What'd he do?
- He get scared and he leave.

840
00:50:42,895 --> 00:50:46,056
- I bet he did.
- I-I don't really
have friend like this,

841
00:50:46,124 --> 00:50:49,536
but, you know, I'm Arab and people think
all Arab have bomb.

842
00:50:49,609 --> 00:50:53,402
You're a bloody ripper, Farouk.
That's fuckin' fantastic.

843
00:50:53,478 --> 00:50:56,573
- Excuse the French, Evonne.
- Get your hand off it, Darryl.

844
00:50:56,642 --> 00:50:59,956
Anyway, um,
I was worried for everyone.

845
00:51:00,032 --> 00:51:03,803
I just didn't want to force
anyone into this. Farouk?

846
00:51:03,868 --> 00:51:06,135
No, I'm with you,
Mr. Darryl.

847
00:51:06,202 --> 00:51:09,167
- Evonne?
- What are they gonna do
my ex hasn't done?

848
00:51:09,238 --> 00:51:12,367
- Jack?
- Yeah, fuck 'em.

849
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:15,500
Well, Dennis Denuto
is acting on our behalf.

850
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:18,250
We've gotta be
in federal court next Tuesday.

851
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,007
Does he think
we've got a good case?

852
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:23,206
Well, he reckons it just has
to contravene the Constitution.

853
00:51:23,273 --> 00:51:26,053
And the Constitution
is the biggest law we've got.

854
00:51:27,733 --> 00:51:28,755
How much?

855
00:51:28,934 --> 00:51:31,321
Ah, good point, Evonne. Steve?

856
00:51:33,538 --> 00:51:37,211
Now, all up,
it's gonna cost 1,500.

857
00:51:37,278 --> 00:51:40,624
Now, that's 750 now,
750 in six months' time.

858
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:42,901
So 150 each.

859
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:46,033
And, Jack, I know you can't do it,
so I'm kickin' in for you.

860
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,588
Oh, good on you, Darryl.
I'll pay you back.

861
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:51,046
- Evonne?
- Yeah, fine.

862
00:51:51,122 --> 00:51:53,192
- Farouk?
- I pay cash now.

863
00:51:53,264 --> 00:51:58,180
No, no, no, hold your horses.
What is it with wogs and cash?

864
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:01,063
Anyway, it's
bargain-basement prices,

865
00:52:01,128 --> 00:52:05,532
and, uh, you'd better
wear a suit this time, Farouk.

866
00:52:05,605 --> 00:52:07,774
What's this Dennis Denuto
like, Darryl?

867
00:52:07,842 --> 00:52:11,864
Ah, he's a lawyer.
This is about the law.

868
00:52:11,935 --> 00:52:14,485
He's gotta know
what he's doin'.

869
00:52:17,785 --> 00:52:20,401
Um... all--
all right.

870
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,672
Gi-Give me
one moment...

871
00:52:22,741 --> 00:52:24,594
and I--
and I will.

872
00:52:24,659 --> 00:52:27,145
Um... it's the--

873
00:52:29,134 --> 00:52:31,043
the, um-- the--

874
00:52:32,844 --> 00:52:35,459
the Constitution
of Australia.

875
00:52:35,529 --> 00:52:39,104
This is a blatant violation...

876
00:52:39,174 --> 00:52:42,520
of the Constitution
of the Commonwealth of Australia.

877
00:52:42,595 --> 00:52:45,407
And when it comes
to violations,

878
00:52:45,472 --> 00:52:47,576
they don't come
any bigger.

879
00:52:48,989 --> 00:52:52,215
What section of the Constitution
has been breached?

880
00:52:52,282 --> 00:52:54,135
Section?

881
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,783
Wh-What section?

882
00:52:56,853 --> 00:52:59,306
There is no one section.

883
00:52:59,379 --> 00:53:02,921
It's just the vibe of the thing.

884
00:53:04,495 --> 00:53:08,233
I'm afraid, Mr. Denuto,
you'll have to be more specific.

885
00:53:08,299 --> 00:53:10,152
Oh, yeah,
sure, sure.

886
00:53:10,218 --> 00:53:13,313
I was just starting general,
and then I was getting...
more specific...

887
00:53:13,382 --> 00:53:17,241
with the-- the, um--
Just one moment, please.

888
00:53:17,315 --> 00:53:19,484
The, um--

889
00:53:19,554 --> 00:53:22,812
Jesus, Darryl,
I am sweatin' here.

890
00:53:22,878 --> 00:53:24,917
You're killin' them,
Dennis.

891
00:53:24,988 --> 00:53:27,374
I don't even know
Roman numerals.

892
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:30,578
Um-- It's-- It's--

893
00:53:30,646 --> 00:53:32,500
Ju--
I've got it here.

894
00:53:32,565 --> 00:53:36,391
It's the... section 51,

895
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:39,758
uh, second
from the bottom.

896
00:53:41,069 --> 00:53:43,587
"The Parliament shall
have power to make laws...

897
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:46,754
with respect to copyrights,
patents of inventions...

898
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,993
and designs
and trademarks."

899
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:51,580
It's all part of it.

900
00:53:51,652 --> 00:53:53,951
This is what I'm getting at.
That's my point.

901
00:53:54,017 --> 00:53:56,186
It's-- It's
the vibe of it.

902
00:53:56,256 --> 00:53:59,221
All right. Taken.

903
00:53:59,292 --> 00:54:01,778
Do you have a precedent
which supports...

904
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:04,052
this...vibe?

905
00:54:04,121 --> 00:54:07,151
Uh... yes.

906
00:54:07,221 --> 00:54:10,252
Yes, I do.
Um, just one moment.

907
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:14,825
What's the name
of the famous aboriginal?

908
00:54:14,895 --> 00:54:17,064
- Cathy Freeman.
- No, the court case.

909
00:54:17,133 --> 00:54:19,683
- Evonne Goolagong.
- No, no, no. Ma-- Mabo.

910
00:54:19,754 --> 00:54:21,661
Mabo.

911
00:54:21,737 --> 00:54:24,222
What about it?

912
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:27,836
That's your classic case
of big business...

913
00:54:27,907 --> 00:54:29,793
trying to take land,

914
00:54:29,857 --> 00:54:31,710
and they couldn't.

915
00:54:31,775 --> 00:54:34,642
Mr. Denuto,
the Mabo decision...

916
00:54:34,717 --> 00:54:39,088
pertains to the specific
issue of native land title
and terra nullius.

917
00:54:39,161 --> 00:54:41,046
Yeah.

918
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:45,133
So what part of the judgment
is relevant to this case?

919
00:54:45,203 --> 00:54:49,672
A-Again, i-it's just
the vibe of it.

920
00:54:51,757 --> 00:54:54,721
Actually, may I
approach the bench?

921
00:55:02,307 --> 00:55:04,792
Am I wasting
my time here?

922
00:55:04,865 --> 00:55:07,100
Your case
is not strong.

923
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:10,873
- Am I sort of in the ballpark though?
- I'm a judge.

924
00:55:10,939 --> 00:55:13,588
I understand.
Can you just give me an angle?

925
00:55:13,657 --> 00:55:15,988
I'm sorry, Mr. Denuto.
I can't.

926
00:55:16,055 --> 00:55:18,125
Understood.
Understood.

927
00:55:18,197 --> 00:55:20,780
I think I've got
a good one anyway.

928
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:31,167
In summing up,
i-it's the Constitution,

929
00:55:31,241 --> 00:55:34,685
it's Mabo,
it's justice, it's law.

930
00:55:34,758 --> 00:55:38,431
It's the vibe,
and, uh--

931
00:55:38,498 --> 00:55:40,918
No, that's it.
It's the vibe.

932
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:44,949
I rest my case.

933
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,887
That was sensational.

934
00:55:47,962 --> 00:55:50,197
Counsel for the respondent?

935
00:55:51,574 --> 00:55:54,027
Your Honor, I don't wish to waste
any more of your time.

936
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:57,393
- Appreciated.
- All our arguments are contained
in the forward documents,

937
00:55:57,458 --> 00:56:01,033
and we'd be more than happy
for that to constitute
the case for the respondent.

938
00:56:01,101 --> 00:56:03,238
Thank you. So be it.

939
00:56:03,308 --> 00:56:05,640
I call a one-hour
adjournment.

940
00:56:05,706 --> 00:56:08,573
Good on ya, Dennis.
That shut 'em up.

941
00:56:08,647 --> 00:56:11,546
I'm going for a bit
of a breather, mate.

942
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:53,436
How you goin'?

943
00:56:53,502 --> 00:56:55,539
Oh, fine. Fine.

944
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:57,999
- Got a case comin' up?
- Uh, no, no.

945
00:56:58,074 --> 00:57:00,886
I'm here to see someone.
I'm-I'm a spectator today.

946
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:04,658
- Are you?
- My son's first appearance.

947
00:57:04,724 --> 00:57:08,234
Oh? Do you reckon
he'll get off?

948
00:57:08,305 --> 00:57:10,723
Oh, no, no.
He's a barrister.

949
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:14,308
- He's appearing for
the first time as a barrister.
- Congratulations.

950
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,798
- Thank you.
- Uh, Darryl Kerrigan.

951
00:57:16,873 --> 00:57:19,652
- Lawrence Hammill.
- G'day, Lawrence.

952
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:22,879
Barrister, eh?
He'd need a degree for that.

953
00:57:22,947 --> 00:57:26,261
Yes, yes. He-He's got a couple,
actually.

954
00:57:26,336 --> 00:57:30,293
- Ah, you must be as proud as punch.
- Well, you know.

955
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:32,729
Oh, I know.
I've got a daughter.

956
00:57:32,794 --> 00:57:36,435
Diploma certificate,
fully qualified hairdresser.

957
00:57:36,503 --> 00:57:40,656
The day she came home
and told me she'd got
into Sunshine Tech...

958
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:44,015
- was the proudest day of my life.
- Yes, yes, I can imagine.

959
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,939
Yeah, sure makes us parents
look like a bunch of dodos, eh?

960
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:52,355
You wouldn't have dreamt
of doing what your son's done.

961
00:57:52,424 --> 00:57:56,032
No, no. Anyway, Darryl,
what brings you here?

962
00:57:56,101 --> 00:57:58,520
Our bloody government's
trying to take my house.

963
00:57:58,595 --> 00:58:01,081
This new Air Link thing.
I mean, imagine that.

964
00:58:01,152 --> 00:58:03,638
Sal and me, we brought up
our whole family in that house,

965
00:58:03,711 --> 00:58:06,261
and they think they
can just walk in--

966
00:58:07,706 --> 00:58:10,486
Anyway, we're takin' 'em
to court.

967
00:58:10,552 --> 00:58:14,193
Bloody outrageous.
It's gotta be against the Constitution.

968
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:17,160
Yes, it is outrageous.
Who's acting for you?

969
00:58:17,234 --> 00:58:20,776
- Dennis Denuto.
- Uh, never heard of him.

970
00:58:20,847 --> 00:58:23,626
You wouldn't have.
He just does our local area.

971
00:58:23,692 --> 00:58:26,820
Yeah, but I've never heard of him
in Constitutional law.

972
00:58:26,888 --> 00:58:29,701
Oh, no, you wouldn't.
No, he does conveyancing mainly.

973
00:58:29,766 --> 00:58:32,185
You know, wills, petty theft,
that sort of thing.

974
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,647
But hey, it's all based
on the Constitution.

975
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:38,067
Yes. Yes, in a way.

976
00:58:38,144 --> 00:58:41,752
- Good bloke though.
- Yes. Sounds like it.

977
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,566
Anyway, uh,
I'd better be going.

978
00:58:44,633 --> 00:58:47,979
- Sure.
- Nice talking to you, Lawrie.

979
00:58:48,053 --> 00:58:50,604
- Nice talking to you, Darryl.
- And good luck with your boy.

980
00:58:50,675 --> 00:58:54,981
Thanks, Darryl.
I hope everything works out.

981
00:58:55,056 --> 00:58:57,901
Ah, yeah, yeah.
I'm pretty confident.

982
00:58:57,965 --> 00:59:00,232
I find in favor
of the respondent.

983
00:59:00,299 --> 00:59:02,207
Yes!

984
00:59:04,392 --> 00:59:06,561
It's them, Darryl.

985
00:59:06,629 --> 00:59:09,790
But we was respondin'
to them.

986
00:59:09,858 --> 00:59:13,749
We lost, Darryl.
I'm sorry.

987
00:59:13,823 --> 00:59:16,951
<i>Dad reckons he must have
sat there for an hour.</i>

988
00:59:17,019 --> 00:59:20,496
<i>He said it was like being kicked
in the guts with the back end of a bus.</i>

989
00:59:20,568 --> 00:59:24,526
<i>Dad had to explain to Farouk
that they had lost.</i>

990
00:59:24,629 --> 00:59:27,659
<i>It was really hard
telling Evonne too.</i>

991
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:30,541
<i>But the toughest one
was Jack.</i>

992
00:59:35,818 --> 00:59:37,671
<i>Trace and Con
were great though.</i>

993
00:59:39,558 --> 00:59:43,483
Good on you, Dad. You stood up to them.
I'm so proud of you.

994
00:59:43,556 --> 00:59:47,000
I'm so impressed with your fighting
quality, Mr. Kerrigan.

995
00:59:47,072 --> 00:59:48,924
Thanks, mate.

996
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:52,631
And can I just say how disenchanted
I am with our legal system.

997
00:59:57,974 --> 01:00:01,168
<i>Dad was very quiet
after losing the court case.</i>

998
01:00:01,236 --> 01:00:03,754
<i>I'd never seen him so down.</i>

999
01:00:03,825 --> 01:00:07,138
<i>He even stopped complimenting Mum
on her cooking.</i>

1000
01:00:09,452 --> 01:00:11,457
You all right there,
Darryl?

1001
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:13,383
Yeah.

1002
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:20,064
Dad?

1003
01:00:20,129 --> 01:00:22,877
Someone's, uh,

1004
01:00:22,943 --> 01:00:25,591
sellin' a telephone box.

1005
01:00:32,406 --> 01:00:35,121
They said no
to an extension.

1006
01:00:36,307 --> 01:00:38,727
Dennis says we've got
to be out in two weeks.

1007
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,653
Two weeks?

1008
01:00:47,657 --> 01:00:50,110
I haven't told Wayne yet.

1009
01:00:51,749 --> 01:00:54,430
<i>I think Dad felt he'd let
everyone down, but especially Wayne.</i>

1010
01:00:54,498 --> 01:00:57,311
<i>That's why he'd been
puttin' off tellin' him.</i>

1011
01:00:57,376 --> 01:01:00,221
<i>He just couldn't think of a way
to break it to Wayne.</i>

1012
01:01:00,286 --> 01:01:03,282
<i>I told Dad not to worry.
I knew how to tell Wayne we'd lost.</i>

1013
01:01:03,354 --> 01:01:06,864
- We lost.
- Lost?

1014
01:01:06,935 --> 01:01:09,584
Yeah.

1015
01:01:09,653 --> 01:01:11,506
Did Dad do his nut?

1016
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:14,667
Nah, he's gone all quiet.

1017
01:01:15,823 --> 01:01:18,309
Quiet?

1018
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:21,574
Yeah. I think he thinks
he's let everyone down.

1019
01:01:21,642 --> 01:01:23,495
Letus down?

1020
01:01:23,561 --> 01:01:26,209
Yeah, that's what I think.

1021
01:01:26,277 --> 01:01:28,130
See, especially you.

1022
01:01:28,196 --> 01:01:31,389
I think he was lookin' forward
to the day you came back to the house.

1023
01:01:31,457 --> 01:01:33,789
Well, you tell Dad...

1024
01:01:33,855 --> 01:01:37,463
the only reason
I loved that house is 'cause
it had him and Mum in it...

1025
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:40,311
and like... everyone else.

1026
01:01:40,377 --> 01:01:42,928
Wherever they go,
I'll love...

1027
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:46,291
as long as it
has them in it.

1028
01:01:46,355 --> 01:01:50,542
And all those lawyers
and government people
can just go and get fucked.

1029
01:01:50,608 --> 01:01:52,461
"...as long as it
has them in it.

1030
01:01:52,526 --> 01:01:55,752
And all those lawyers
and government people
can go and get fucked."

1031
01:01:55,819 --> 01:01:59,874
Ah, he wanted me to change
that " get fucked" bit, but I forgot.

1032
01:01:59,943 --> 01:02:02,591
On you, mate.

1033
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,145
I'd better keep packin'.

1034
01:02:42,144 --> 01:02:45,589
Dad?

1035
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:48,081
Steven.

1036
01:02:48,155 --> 01:02:52,821
I can, uh, get you
some more boxes, if you want.

1037
01:02:52,886 --> 01:02:55,601
No, I think I'll be all right,
Steve.

1038
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:01,996
Dad?

1039
01:03:04,172 --> 01:03:06,342
You haven't let anyone down.

1040
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:11,426
I don't know what the opposite of...
lettin' someone down is,

1041
01:03:13,253 --> 01:03:15,584
but you done
the opposite.

1042
01:03:28,407 --> 01:03:30,771
When are you
gonna sign 'em?

1043
01:03:32,914 --> 01:03:36,010
- I don't know.
- They gotta be done by Friday.

1044
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,695
I can't.

1045
01:03:38,765 --> 01:03:40,770
lcan't.
I just can't.

1046
01:03:40,842 --> 01:03:43,208
Darryl, we gotta go.

1047
01:03:43,273 --> 01:03:45,246
Yeah, I know.
I know we lost.

1048
01:03:45,319 --> 01:03:47,650
I know we gotta get out
of this place.

1049
01:03:47,717 --> 01:03:51,488
I know this is no longer
our house, but I'll be buggered
if I can sign those papers.

1050
01:03:51,553 --> 01:03:55,325
I just cannot physically
pick up the pen and sign them.

1051
01:04:00,121 --> 01:04:02,127
Did you speak
to Jack?

1052
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,734
Yeah, yeah. His son-in-law's moved
to Perth, so he's no help.

1053
01:04:06,804 --> 01:04:10,062
Poor Jack.

1054
01:04:10,128 --> 01:04:14,020
Listen, I-I told him
he could stay with us
until we work somethin' out.

1055
01:04:15,627 --> 01:04:17,764
How'd you go
with the agent?

1056
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:20,896
Two-bedroom units
are $80,000.

1057
01:04:20,966 --> 01:04:22,819
A flat.

1058
01:04:22,884 --> 01:04:26,264
With four people,
the greyhounds,

1059
01:04:26,338 --> 01:04:28,572
five cars,

1060
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:30,547
the boat and Jack.

1061
01:04:30,622 --> 01:04:32,627
It'll be okay.

1062
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:36,525
- And what are we gonna do with Wayne?
- Wayne'll understand.

1063
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,860
You know he keeps a photo
of this place on his wall.

1064
01:04:39,926 --> 01:04:41,779
I know.

1065
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:46,890
He gets out after five years,
we have to put him in a laundry
smaller than his cell.

1066
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:50,305
- Maybe we rent.
- Rent?

1067
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:53,606
We not only lose our place,
we're payin' for someone else's.

1068
01:04:53,672 --> 01:04:57,597
- Oh, Darryl--
- I'm starting to understand
how the aborigines feel.

1069
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:02,552
Have you been drinkin'?

1070
01:05:02,624 --> 01:05:05,407
Well, this house
is like their land.

1071
01:05:05,473 --> 01:05:07,579
It-It holds
their memories.

1072
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:09,984
The land is their story.
It's everything.

1073
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:13,826
You just can't pick it up
and plonk it down somewhere else.

1074
01:05:15,234 --> 01:05:18,530
This country's gotta stop
stealin' other people's land.

1075
01:05:18,595 --> 01:05:21,979
Dad? There's someone
here to see you.

1076
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:25,796
G'day, Darryl.

1077
01:05:26,917 --> 01:05:28,773
Lawrie.

1078
01:05:29,863 --> 01:05:32,035
So I thought
I'd come and visit.

1079
01:05:32,104 --> 01:05:34,974
- But how'd you find us?
- You know us dodos.

1080
01:05:35,047 --> 01:05:37,951
- We've got a few tricks up our sleeves.
- Don't I know it.

1081
01:05:39,017 --> 01:05:42,181
I, uh, heard
about the decision.

1082
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:45,447
Yeah. Yeah, well,
that's the way these things are.

1083
01:05:45,514 --> 01:05:48,067
- How'd your boy go?
- Oh, fine. Yeah, fine.

1084
01:05:48,138 --> 01:05:51,850
- Great.
- Darryl, I wonder if I
could put something to you.

1085
01:05:51,917 --> 01:05:53,772
Yeah, sure.

1086
01:05:53,837 --> 01:05:56,706
I don't think I
introduced myself fully.

1087
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:00,425
You see, I'm retired now,
but I'm actually a lawyer myself.

1088
01:06:00,495 --> 01:06:04,684
Three degrees in the family.
I'd like to see your poolroom.

1089
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:07,687
I'm, uh,
what's called a Q.C.

1090
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,858
- Are you? A Q.C.? You're one of those?
- What's that?

1091
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:14,377
- Uh, Queens Counsel.
- Oh, you counsel the queen?

1092
01:06:14,449 --> 01:06:17,581
Uh, they're the lawyers
rich people use, love.

1093
01:06:17,649 --> 01:06:21,000
Yeah, well, that's probably
the most accurate way of describing us.

1094
01:06:21,075 --> 01:06:22,985
I don't think Dennis
would be a Q.C.

1095
01:06:23,059 --> 01:06:26,802
N-No, no, I don't think.

1096
01:06:26,868 --> 01:06:29,203
Anyway, my specialty
as a Q.C...

1097
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:32,172
was Constitutional law,
Australian Constitutional law.

1098
01:06:32,246 --> 01:06:34,767
Have you heard of
the Tasmanian Dams case?

1099
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:38,195
- Um--
- Mabo?

1100
01:06:38,264 --> 01:06:41,494
Oh, the aboriginal guy,
told the government to shove it.

1101
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,415
That's the one.

1102
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,157
Uh, anyway, I've had quite
a bit to do with these over the years,

1103
01:06:47,224 --> 01:06:50,839
and I've had a look into your case
over the last few days,

1104
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:53,394
and I think there's
a bit more to it.

1105
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:56,763
- What do you mean?
- I think you've got a case.

1106
01:06:56,827 --> 01:06:59,894
- So Dennis was on the right track.
- Y-Yes.

1107
01:06:59,964 --> 01:07:01,939
I told you that judge
had it in for him.

1108
01:07:02,013 --> 01:07:04,283
I believe there's a section
of the Constitution...

1109
01:07:04,349 --> 01:07:07,579
about the government's right to acquire
land that hasn't been tested.

1110
01:07:07,646 --> 01:07:09,719
But Dennis tested it.

1111
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:13,654
Well, I-I think we
could test it better.

1112
01:07:13,728 --> 01:07:17,820
Anyway, I would like
to appear on your behalf... gratis.

1113
01:07:18,977 --> 01:07:22,108
- No fee.
- Well, no, we couldn't.

1114
01:07:22,179 --> 01:07:24,599
I've done pretty well
out of this law caper over the years,

1115
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:27,544
- so if you're happy for me
to take it further--
- Further?

1116
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:30,619
But we've been
to the federal court.

1117
01:07:30,691 --> 01:07:33,027
How much further
can we take it?

1118
01:07:33,124 --> 01:07:34,947
<i>Three weeks later,
Mr Hammill, Dad and Dennis</i>

1119
01:07:35,012 --> 01:07:39,007
<i>went to the High Court in Canberra.</i>

1120
01:07:39,078 --> 01:07:41,980
<i>Lawrie asked Dennis to be
his instructing solicitor.</i>

1121
01:07:42,054 --> 01:07:45,284
<i>Dennis was stoked,
but shittin' himself at the same time.</i>

1122
01:07:45,351 --> 01:07:47,741
I'm shittin' myself.

1123
01:07:47,816 --> 01:07:51,679
- Shall we?
- Let's stick it up 'em.

1124
01:07:54,218 --> 01:07:56,552
<i>And so Dad, or as he
was called by the judge--</i>

1125
01:07:56,617 --> 01:07:59,368
<i>Darryl John Kerrigan--</i>

1126
01:07:59,434 --> 01:08:01,671
<i>sat in the High Court
of Australia and put his case.</i>

1127
01:08:01,739 --> 01:08:03,912
<i>Or at least
Mr. Hammill did.</i>

1128
01:08:03,981 --> 01:08:08,259
<i>Dennis was very helpful too.
He was passing books around
like a librarian.</i>

1129
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:11,366
<i>He even learnt Roman numerals
especially for the trip.</i>

1130
01:08:11,437 --> 01:08:15,433
Um, paragraph, uh... 31.

1131
01:08:15,503 --> 01:08:18,701
- Thank you, Dennis.
- But Dad reckoned there
was no doubt about it.

1132
01:08:18,768 --> 01:08:21,899
<i>From the moment he stood up,
Mr. Hammill was the star of the show.</i>

1133
01:08:21,968 --> 01:08:25,515
Section 51,
paragraph 31.

1134
01:08:25,586 --> 01:08:28,434
"The parliament shall
have power to make laws...

1135
01:08:28,498 --> 01:08:33,518
with respect to the acquisition
of property on just terms."

1136
01:08:33,587 --> 01:08:36,457
Let's think about those words,
"on just terms" ...

1137
01:08:36,531 --> 01:08:39,117
and how they relate
to real people.

1138
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:41,578
Your Honor, my client
built his home by the law,

1139
01:08:41,652 --> 01:08:44,304
in full accordance
with the law.

1140
01:08:44,373 --> 01:08:46,763
He doesn't know
about the extensions.

1141
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:48,978
But does he have
the protection of the law?

1142
01:08:49,047 --> 01:08:53,303
How can the forcible removal
of a family, a good family,
from their home...

1143
01:08:53,368 --> 01:08:56,368
have the blessing
of our Constitution?

1144
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,671
How can that be...
"just terms" ?

1145
01:08:59,737 --> 01:09:01,842
<i>Dad reckoned it
was in the bag,</i>

1146
01:09:01,913 --> 01:09:05,624
<i>even though they had five times
more lawyers than we did.</i>

1147
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:08,506
My client has adhered
to the law, every law,

1148
01:09:08,571 --> 01:09:12,500
every statute from the Town Planning Act
to Civil Aviation Regulations.

1149
01:09:12,572 --> 01:09:15,736
But in what can only be described
as a last desperate measure,

1150
01:09:15,804 --> 01:09:20,028
my client is accused
of breaching none other
than the Constitution.

1151
01:09:20,093 --> 01:09:23,029
I mean, good Lord,
what else are we guilty of?

1152
01:09:23,103 --> 01:09:26,006
lnternational war crimes, hmm?

1153
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,698
He's even paid people
to laugh for him.

1154
01:09:28,768 --> 01:09:32,064
I refer the court to His Honor
Mr. Justice Dixon's decision...

1155
01:09:32,129 --> 01:09:33,984
in Grace Brothers
and the Commonwealth.

1156
01:09:34,049 --> 01:09:37,214
<i>As much as Dad hated to admit
it the other lawyer was good,</i>

1157
01:09:37,282 --> 01:09:39,868
<i>and he was gonna give us
a real run for our money.</i>

1158
01:09:39,939 --> 01:09:41,794
A safeguard
to the commonwealth.

1159
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:45,861
<i>But if Mr. Hammill was worried,
he didn't show it. He kept right on at 'em.</i>

1160
01:09:45,862 --> 01:09:48,250
...has acquired the status
of a constitutional guarantee,

1161
01:09:48,326 --> 01:09:50,430
which is designed
to protect the individual--

1162
01:09:50,502 --> 01:09:53,055
<i>But everything he said,
they had an answer for.</i>

1163
01:09:53,126 --> 01:09:56,541
- Your Honor, that statement
was obiter dictum.
- Was not!

1164
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:02,022
Well, it wasn't.

1165
01:10:02,089 --> 01:10:04,260
- Was it?
- I don't know.

1166
01:10:04,328 --> 01:10:08,420
The interpretation of
"on just terms" was considered
in the Tasmanian Dams case.

1167
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:12,517
The court took into account
the interests of the community,

1168
01:10:12,587 --> 01:10:15,522
such as, uh,
job creation--

1169
01:10:15,595 --> 01:10:18,116
<i>Dad reckoned Dennis got
the hang of things real quick.</i>

1170
01:10:18,188 --> 01:10:22,411
<i>The main job of the senior counsel
was to provide backup for the Q.C.</i>

1171
01:10:22,476 --> 01:10:26,055
Ah, yes. And this is further underlined
in Georgiades--

1172
01:10:26,126 --> 01:10:29,356
- And that's what Dennis did.
- Ah, utilitarianism.

1173
01:10:29,423 --> 01:10:32,173
The greatest good
for the greatest number.

1174
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:35,110
But what this principle
fails to--

1175
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:44,272
What this principle fails to take
into account...

1176
01:10:44,338 --> 01:10:48,202
is that competing rights cannot
be weighed one against the other.

1177
01:10:48,276 --> 01:10:51,725
Is a family's right to live freely
in their home outweighed--

1178
01:10:51,796 --> 01:10:54,033
<i>It wasn't just
legal argument.</i>

1179
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:56,720
<i>Mr. Hammill even put jokes in,
clever jokes.</i>

1180
01:10:56,790 --> 01:11:00,205
...not that our children
will have a place to live,

1181
01:11:00,278 --> 01:11:04,239
but whether they'll have prompt delivery
of their parcels.

1182
01:11:04,311 --> 01:11:06,962
<i>Dad thought
it was real funny,</i>

1183
01:11:07,032 --> 01:11:09,236
<i>even though he
didn't get it.</i>

1184
01:11:09,305 --> 01:11:12,305
Suffer in your jocks.

1185
01:11:12,378 --> 01:11:16,372
<i>In fact, there were
a lot of times he didn't quite
understand what was being said,</i>

1186
01:11:16,441 --> 01:11:20,186
<i>but one time he knew exactly
what was being said.</i>

1187
01:11:20,252 --> 01:11:23,481
He's even approached
the appellant with an offer
of compensation,

1188
01:11:23,548 --> 01:11:28,089
a generous offer considering
the nature of the, uh, dwelling,

1189
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:31,125
or as it might more accurately
be called, eyesore.

1190
01:11:31,197 --> 01:11:33,784
- What are you calling an eyesore?
- Darryl.

1191
01:11:33,855 --> 01:11:36,092
It's called a home,
you dickhead!

1192
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,014
- Your Honor.
- Darryl!

1193
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:40,926
It's a bloody fine one. If there
were more homes like that, we'd--

1194
01:11:40,992 --> 01:11:43,710
Have the jails full
of people like your son?

1195
01:11:43,776 --> 01:11:46,646
- Ah, this bloody asshole!
- Sit down, Darryl.

1196
01:11:46,721 --> 01:11:49,242
Mr. Hammill, I'm calling
an adjournment.

1197
01:11:49,314 --> 01:11:54,051
And I trust that your client
will, in the meantime, compose himself.

1198
01:11:54,116 --> 01:11:59,267
Mr. Lyle, I'll thank you
not to make any further value
judgments in this court.

1199
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:01,276
I'm sorry, Lawrie.

1200
01:12:01,349 --> 01:12:03,259
That's all right, Darryl.

1201
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:05,275
I was thinking
the same thing,

1202
01:12:05,351 --> 01:12:07,838
though not
in those words.

1203
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:10,813
I wish I had your words.

1204
01:12:10,888 --> 01:12:12,743
How dare they?

1205
01:12:12,808 --> 01:12:14,663
I mean, an eyesore!

1206
01:12:14,728 --> 01:12:17,958
I mean, that--
that just goes to show
that they don't get it.

1207
01:12:18,025 --> 01:12:20,360
I mean, they're judging the place
by what it looks like,

1208
01:12:20,425 --> 01:12:25,315
and if it doesn't have
a pool or a classy front
or a big garden--

1209
01:12:25,387 --> 01:12:27,394
It's got a pretty good gate.

1210
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:31,495
And then because of that,
it's not worth saving.

1211
01:12:31,565 --> 01:12:35,144
But it's not a house.
It's a home.

1212
01:12:35,213 --> 01:12:37,702
It's got everything.

1213
01:12:37,774 --> 01:12:41,320
People who love each other,
care for each other.

1214
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:43,333
It's got memories.

1215
01:12:43,407 --> 01:12:45,350
Great memories.

1216
01:12:45,425 --> 01:12:49,167
It's a place
for the family to turn to,

1217
01:12:49,232 --> 01:12:51,721
come back to.

1218
01:12:51,793 --> 01:12:56,366
But that doesn't seem to mean as much
as a big fuckin' driveway.

1219
01:12:56,434 --> 01:12:59,502
<i>Later it was time
for Mr. Hammill to sum up.</i>

1220
01:12:59,572 --> 01:13:02,921
<i>Dad said
he was unbelievable.</i>

1221
01:13:02,996 --> 01:13:05,930
<i>He reckoned he finished
like a champion greyhound.</i>

1222
01:13:06,004 --> 01:13:07,350
People who love each other--

1223
01:13:07,351 --> 01:13:09,984
<i>He quoted cases, he quoted laws.</i>

1224
01:13:10,243 --> 01:13:13,967
<i>But Dad nearly fell off
his chair when Mr. Hammill
finished by quoting Dad,</i>

1225
01:13:14,038 --> 01:13:15,893
<i>only better.</i>

1226
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:19,155
And somehow that's not worth
as much as a big driveway.

1227
01:13:19,224 --> 01:13:24,113
You may think our appeal
is based on emotion rather than law.

1228
01:13:24,185 --> 01:13:26,226
Not true.

1229
01:13:26,298 --> 01:13:30,389
It's about the highest law in
this country, the Constitution,

1230
01:13:30,459 --> 01:13:34,072
and one phrase within it:
"on just terms."

1231
01:13:36,605 --> 01:13:39,921
That's what this
is all about-- being just.

1232
01:13:39,996 --> 01:13:43,413
They want to pay only
for the house.

1233
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:47,316
But they're taking away
more than that, so much more.

1234
01:13:47,391 --> 01:13:50,523
Sure, the Kerrigans
built a house,

1235
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:53,243
then they built a home,
and then a family.

1236
01:13:53,312 --> 01:13:57,536
You can acquire a house,

1237
01:13:57,601 --> 01:14:00,284
but you can't
acquire a home,

1238
01:14:00,354 --> 01:14:03,038
because a home is not built
of bricks and mortar...

1239
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:06,653
but love and memories.

1240
01:14:07,909 --> 01:14:10,047
You can't pay for it,

1241
01:14:10,116 --> 01:14:13,019
and you're just shortchanging
people if you try.

1242
01:14:13,093 --> 01:14:17,371
I can't speak for those
who wrote this document,

1243
01:14:17,446 --> 01:14:21,059
but I'll bet when they put in
the phrase " on just terms,"

1244
01:14:21,126 --> 01:14:24,424
they hoped
it would stop anyone...

1245
01:14:24,488 --> 01:14:28,896
shortchanging someone
like Darryl Kerrigan.

1246
01:14:30,954 --> 01:14:33,572
Thanks, Lawrence.

1247
01:14:39,563 --> 01:14:42,663
Thank you.

1248
01:14:42,731 --> 01:14:46,815
<i>In the end, who knows whether
it was Dad's words or Mr. Hammill</i>

1249
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:50,263
<i>or even Dennis' note passing--
...but we won the case.</i>

1250
01:14:50,431 --> 01:14:52,293
...in favor
of the appellant.

1251
01:14:52,366 --> 01:14:54,221
Shit.

1252
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,775
That's us.

1253
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,524
Bullshit.
We won?

1254
01:15:00,592 --> 01:15:03,975
- We won.
- You little ripper!

1255
01:15:04,049 --> 01:15:07,945
Thanks, lads.

1256
01:15:08,018 --> 01:15:08,779
We won.

1257
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:11,382
<i>Dad was stoked
but suitably restrained.</i>

1258
01:15:11,475 --> 01:15:14,345
<i>He reckons the other side
didn't know what to do with themselves.</i>

1259
01:15:14,418 --> 01:15:16,841
<i>Dennis was so stunned,
he went all quiet.</i>

1260
01:15:16,916 --> 01:15:20,462
<i>Dad reckons he almost cried.
In fact, I think he did.</i>

1261
01:15:20,533 --> 01:15:23,054
<i>Mr. Hammill
just sat there for ages.</i>

1262
01:15:23,126 --> 01:15:27,381
<i>He reckoned it was the most satisfying
victory he'd had in 47 years.</i>

1263
01:15:27,447 --> 01:15:31,125
<i>Dad reckons it's important
to be noble in victory,
so he spoke to the other Q.C. ...</i>

1264
01:15:31,191 --> 01:15:32,218
Oh, hey.

1265
01:15:32,219 --> 01:15:33,850
<i>...the one who had a go at Wayne.</i>

1266
01:15:33,993 --> 01:15:36,309
Bad luck.

1267
01:15:36,376 --> 01:15:39,444
You dickhead!

1268
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:43,953
<i>The case was all over
the news that night.</i>

1269
01:15:44,059 --> 01:15:47,955
Good evening. First tonight,
a landmark decision in
the High Court today...

1270
01:15:48,028 --> 01:15:51,476
has confirmed the age-old saying,
"A man's home is his castle."

1271
01:15:51,549 --> 01:15:55,827
When the huge Air Link
consortium tried to compulsorily
acquire a string of homes...

1272
01:15:55,902 --> 01:15:58,291
on Melbourne's outskirts
earlier this year,

1273
01:15:58,366 --> 01:16:00,636
they didn't expect a fight.

1274
01:16:00,703 --> 01:16:04,152
- Well, they got one.
- It was a
case of Darryl versus Goliath...

1275
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:06,558
in the High Court
of Australia today.

1276
01:16:06,624 --> 01:16:09,659
<i>Mum reckons it's real funny
how one day you're not famous,</i>

1277
01:16:09,729 --> 01:16:11,802
<i>and then the next day
you are... famous,</i>

1278
01:16:11,873 --> 01:16:13,728
<i>and then you're not
anymore.</i>

1279
01:16:13,793 --> 01:16:18,269
<i>Dad had one of the biggest parties ever
that night back at home.</i>

1280
01:16:18,339 --> 01:16:20,761
<i>He invited everyone
from the neighborhood--</i>

1281
01:16:20,836 --> 01:16:22,810
<i>his friends,
family, in-laws.</i>

1282
01:16:22,885 --> 01:16:25,950
This case has totally regained my faith
in the legal system.

1283
01:16:26,021 --> 01:16:27,850
<i>Mr. Hammill even
brought his son along.</i>

1284
01:16:27,851 --> 01:16:29,693
Really pleased to meet you.

1285
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:32,319
<i>Everyone was havin'
a real good time,</i>

1286
01:16:36,102 --> 01:16:38,341
<i>especially Mum and Dad.</i>

1287
01:16:38,409 --> 01:16:41,605
<i>I'd never seen them
so happy.</i>

1288
01:16:41,673 --> 01:16:43,844
<i>Dad invited everyone
up to Bonnie Doon.</i>

1289
01:16:43,913 --> 01:16:46,085
I fix for you a special Farouk
pressure system.

1290
01:16:46,153 --> 01:16:49,700
<i>Mr. Hammill said he'd love
to come. I don't think he'd
ever fished for carp.</i>

1291
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:54,050
<i>Well, that party
went on and on and on.
Dad smiled all night.</i>

1292
01:16:54,189 --> 01:16:56,265
See, this is why we need that patio.

1293
01:16:56,331 --> 01:16:58,569
<i>The victory was reported
in all the papers.</i>

1294
01:16:58,636 --> 01:17:01,452
<i>It became known
as the Kerrigan Decision.</i>

1295
01:17:01,517 --> 01:17:03,525
Jack, don't thank me.
This is the bloke.

1296
01:17:03,598 --> 01:17:06,981
<i>Although Dad said,
as far as he was concerned,
it was Lawrie's victory.</i>

1297
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:10,023
And don't forget
Dennis here either.

1298
01:17:10,096 --> 01:17:13,445
<i>That was the beginning
of a string of good luck
for our family.</i>

1299
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:17,863
<i>Six months later
we got notice that Wayne would
soon be eligible for parole.</i>

1300
01:17:17,937 --> 01:17:21,800
<i>Dad rang Mr. Hammill,
who was more than happy
to come out of retirement again.</i>

1301
01:17:21,874 --> 01:17:24,592
<i>Wayne said the parole board
couldn't believe their eyes.</i>

1302
01:17:24,658 --> 01:17:28,042
<i>When Mr. Hammill walked in,
he reckons they granted him
parole out of shock.</i>

1303
01:17:30,036 --> 01:17:32,557
<i>Dennis became very well-known
after the case,</i>

1304
01:17:32,628 --> 01:17:34,997
<i>and people came from everywhere
to hire him.</i>

1305
01:17:35,062 --> 01:17:36,917
<i>He won a very big case,</i>

1306
01:17:36,982 --> 01:17:40,878
<i>a class action against people who put
lead in the landfill 15 years ago.</i>

1307
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:44,269
<i>I think Mr. Hammill
helped him there too.
Dad is very happy for him.</i>

1308
01:17:44,344 --> 01:17:47,476
<i>He even bought himself
a new photocopier,</i>

1309
01:17:47,545 --> 01:17:50,033
<i>one that never breaks down.</i>

1310
01:17:50,105 --> 01:17:53,454
<i>And guess what. Mr. Hammill did go up
to Bonnie Doon.</i>

1311
01:17:53,529 --> 01:17:56,597
<i>At first Dad thought it was
out of politeness, but it can't be...</i>

1312
01:17:56,666 --> 01:17:58,903
<i>'cause he goes up there
all the time.</i>

1313
01:17:58,972 --> 01:18:02,966
<i>He and Dad still hit it off
as good as they did
the first day they met.</i>

1314
01:18:03,036 --> 01:18:05,142
<i>Coco never won another race,</i>

1315
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:08,213
<i>but she had a son
which Dad called Son of Coco.</i>

1316
01:18:08,285 --> 01:18:11,155
<i>He hasn't won yet,
but Dad has high hopes.</i>

1317
01:18:11,231 --> 01:18:15,387
<i>Dad did finish the patio
in a Greek style, and the extension,</i>

1318
01:18:15,455 --> 01:18:17,975
<i>and he even put up those big iron gates
that he and Steve...</i>

1319
01:18:18,047 --> 01:18:20,634
<i>had gotten for a bargain
that night in Toorak.</i>

1320
01:18:20,704 --> 01:18:23,006
<i>Steve got back with Kerry,
his old girlfriend.</i>

1321
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:26,685
<i>Eventually they got married
and had a little boy...
three weeks later.</i>

1322
01:18:26,755 --> 01:18:29,755
"Baby carriage,
still in box."

1323
01:18:29,826 --> 01:18:31,966
<i>Con and Trace
had a kid too.</i>

1324
01:18:32,035 --> 01:18:36,473
<i>He's already taken up kickboxing.
They are great parents.</i>

1325
01:18:37,509 --> 01:18:41,306
<i>Wayne started helping Dad
with the tow truck
and really made a go at it.</i>

1326
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:44,927
<i>Dad's even more proud of him now
than when he was in jail.</i>

1327
01:18:44,999 --> 01:18:47,104
<i>It was Wayne's idea
to move into tray trucks.</i>

1328
01:18:47,175 --> 01:18:49,762
<i>Pretty soon they had two,
then three, then eight.</i>

1329
01:18:49,831 --> 01:18:52,647
<i>Who knows when it will stop?
Mum reckons 11.</i>

1330
01:18:52,712 --> 01:18:55,265
<i>She's as proud as punch
with all this.</i>

1331
01:18:55,336 --> 01:19:00,007
<i>And guess what. She did take up pottery.
She didn't even need lessons.</i>

1332
01:19:00,073 --> 01:19:04,548
<i>And Dad, well, he reckoned
he'd got everything
he'd ever wished for.</i>

1333
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:08,329
<i>He often used to sit out on the patio
and just smile to himself.</i>

1334
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:11,114
<i>And they still live
at 3 Highview Crescent,</i>

1335
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:13,516
<i>even though it's only
them two livin' in it.</i>

1336
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:16,037
<i>And Dad still calls it
"his castle."</i>

1337
01:19:19,311 --> 01:19:22,857
My name's Dale Kerrigan,
and that was my story.
