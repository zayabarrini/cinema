1
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,400
Black thorns and roses.

2
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,944
Smiles and tears.

3
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:39,573
They're sown together

4
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:41,575
and grow so near.

5
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:04,306
Dima, wait!

6
00:01:49,185 --> 00:01:51,437
- I win.
- All right.

7
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,773
- Come. Let's go back.
- Oh, relax.

8
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:57,818
Sergey?

9
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:00,737
Enjoy yourself for once.
One more time. Please.

10
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:01,863
Race you to the rocks.

11
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:04,533
OK, but you're
going to lose again. Ready?

12
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,497
Luisa, quick.

13
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:18,589
Halt. Identify yourself.

14
00:02:22,134 --> 00:02:26,347
- Stop or I'll shoot.
- Popov? It's Sidorov.

15
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:29,933
Sidorov?

16
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:33,437
You again.

17
00:02:35,147 --> 00:02:37,774
Kurilka, 0900 hours.

18
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:41,945
Next time, I'll shoot you.

19
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:54,708
Oh! Volodja.

20
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,461
Sergeant Popov's easy.
Two packs of cigarettes.

21
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,795
Life's about who you know.

22
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,297
We can't all have your connections.

23
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,841
You could have my connections,
Luisa. You could have them all.

24
00:03:02,924 --> 00:03:05,219
Oh, bloody rocks!

25
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:44,966
Get up!

26
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,012
Fucking lazy rats.

27
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,723
Slow. Stupid.

28
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:54,643
Useless little rats.

29
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,941
Faster.

30
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:51,242
- Attention.
- At ease.

31
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:54,077
Comrade Colonel, second
squadron ready to manoeuvre.

32
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:18,745
You know, one day the colonel
is going to open his flight reports

33
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,789
and find your human-anatomy diagrams.

34
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:24,501
It's the hardest exam.

35
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:28,171
Then one more to go -
scientific communism.

36
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,756
I'm not going to have a life.

37
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,426
It'll be worth it in the end.

38
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:35,471
Let's do the morning report.

39
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,561
Selenoy, 1:34.

40
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,022
Tokarev, 1:12.

41
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,774
You won't reconsider the colonel's offer?

42
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,902
Give me one good reason.

43
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:55,699
Two good reasons.

44
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:01,580
You could make
a career for yourself here,

45
00:07:01,663 --> 00:07:03,999
rather than stack hay
in the middle of nowhere.

46
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,212
What else is there?

47
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,519
Sergey. Luisa. Wait.

48
00:07:23,602 --> 00:07:26,605
Sergey, take our photograph,
for posterity.

49
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:27,773
Not again.

50
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,109
- I'm going to the canteen.
- Please.

51
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:34,446
Smile in this one.

52
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,618
Comrade Lieutenant.

53
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,830
We were ordered to take
this photograph for the weekly journal.

54
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:46,958
At ease.

55
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:49,670
Let me take one of all of you.

56
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:04,099
Move to your right.

57
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:16,404
Which way to the commander's office?

58
00:08:16,488 --> 00:08:18,449
Comrade Lieutenant, I'll show you.

59
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:26,998
Since the NATO forces increased
surveillance of our border,

60
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:30,461
I've got four Migs up in
the air around the clock.

61
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:35,131
We now assume each B-52 is carrying
several thermonuclear devices.

62
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,926
Should just one slip through,

63
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:41,847
they will be on the direct
air corridor to Leningrad.

64
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,851
It will be your duty to prevent
this from happening.

65
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:48,645
- Understood?
- Yes, Comrade Colonel.

66
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:52,440
Welcome, Lieutenant Matvejev.

67
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:55,902
Dismissed.

68
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:00,699
Send him in.

69
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:10,584
So, young man, I hear you have declined
my offer to stay on.

70
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,169
What are your plans?

71
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,173
I will return home to find
work, Comrade Colonel.

72
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,926
Very well.

73
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,138
Take the Uazik and drive
the lieutenant to the officers' block.

74
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:26,683
You'll be receiving some
additional duties n your final weeks.

75
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:27,851
Yes, Comrade Colonel.

76
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:31,021
Orderly.

77
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:34,691
Yes, Comrade Major.

78
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:41,740
No, he has not returned.

79
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:47,871
I will report immediately,
Comrade Major.

80
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:50,957
Here.

81
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,159
I'm afraid there are no facilities

82
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:28,411
to develop photographs here,
Comrade Lieutenant.

83
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:30,121
Now there are.

84
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,376
- You develop photographs too?
- Yes, I do.

85
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:40,173
- I'll finish it myself.
- Yes, Comrade Lieutenant.

86
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:43,551
- Permission to leave?
- Granted.

87
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:44,678
Private.

88
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,769
Thank you, Comrade Lieutenant.

89
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:39,024
Matvejev.

90
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:42,778
Graduating with first-class hon ours, eh?

91
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:45,446
Don't they say those who
do well at flight school

92
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,742
have problems handling their
equipment in the sky?

93
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:53,579
I was told that one particular pilot
here has problems in that department.

94
00:11:53,664 --> 00:11:55,456
Time will tell.

95
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,477
Shit! Volkov is on duty tonight.

96
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:19,355
He woke up the second unit at 0300 hours

97
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,817
because he found a cigarette
butt outside their barracks.

98
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,320
He made them run 10km
into the forest, dig it a grave

99
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:27,655
and give it a full burial with hon ours.

100
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:28,907
What a dick.

101
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:31,409
What?

102
00:12:35,747 --> 00:12:38,166
At least someone's getting it tonight.

103
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:51,596
Hey, Matvejev.

104
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:09,447
Kissed my chances goodbye.

105
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:13,576
Now I see why she didn't
come swimming with us.

106
00:13:16,537 --> 00:13:18,915
What's the matter with you?

107
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,459
I told you. "Like a sister"?

108
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:22,919
You are in love.

109
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,631
Sergey, do something about it.

110
00:13:27,132 --> 00:13:28,424
Before it's too late.

111
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,889
The safety of the squadron
is paramount.

112
00:13:33,972 --> 00:13:36,474
There will come a day when you
have to choose between

113
00:13:36,557 --> 00:13:39,602
missing your target or
saving your wing man's life.

114
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:43,982
There's a fine line between
bravery and recklessness.

115
00:13:45,776 --> 00:13:48,987
Tomorrow, we will proceed
with the high-altitude attack scenario.

116
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,571
That is all.

117
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:59,080
- Private Serebrennikov?
- Comrade Lieutenant.

118
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:03,168
At ease. Is Luisa here?

119
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:05,796
No, she went to human
resources, Comrade Lieutenant.

120
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,173
That's fine. I'll come by later.

121
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:12,718
Comrade Lieutenant.
Permission to ask you a question.

122
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,307
Would you have time to develop
some photographs later?

123
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:26,066
You're too soft.
Harder. Not one spot left.

124
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,448
A love letter from another
admirer of yours.

125
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,660
- It's been opened again.
- Must be such a fun job,

126
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,743
reading all the thrilling
letters from your mother.

127
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:44,334
Come on. We're playing
durak in the Lenin room.

128
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:49,755
Sergey.
Get out of your fantasy world.

129
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,091
Maybe later.

130
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:34,592
Take it by the corner,

131
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,846
and gently

132
00:15:40,681 --> 00:15:43,434
place it in the water tray.

133
00:16:00,076 --> 00:16:03,371
- Like this, Comrade Lieutenant?
- That's better.

134
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,582
And call me Roman.

135
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:15,216
You really see other people, Sergey.

136
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:22,933
You capture their essence, their soul.

137
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:28,271
I search for something deeper,

138
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:33,401
but I can't quite grasp it.

139
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,363
How do you mean?

140
00:16:45,163 --> 00:16:46,372
When you take a photo

141
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:53,338
there's something in that very moment
which is gone forever.

142
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:56,757
A moment that will never be there again.

143
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,887
Like a ghost escaping this world.

144
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:07,060
I didn't know you were a philosopher.

145
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,275
I think we need a drink.

146
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:18,363
So I gave him a lower score.

147
00:17:18,446 --> 00:17:21,241
The radio was practically
melting with his anger.

148
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:25,953
He was yelling and threatening
like I'd slept with his wife.

149
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:31,001
You know it?

150
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,335
Tchaikovsky.

151
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:39,884
When I first heard it, I was 14.

152
00:17:43,138 --> 00:17:45,098
My best friend Misha was in it.

153
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:53,189
I've never seen a real ballet.

154
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:58,278
How could you be
so uncultured coming from Orel?

155
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:05,701
I've seen a lot of theatre
before being locked up here.

156
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:08,788
Now there's no chance.

157
00:18:14,752 --> 00:18:16,087
Let's check the photos.

158
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:24,179
Steady there, Private.

159
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,771
I should be getting back.
I shouldn't even be here.

160
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:39,777
- You'd better sleep it off here.
- No, I can't

161
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,531
I'll tell the duty officer that
I needed you at the hangar.

162
00:18:43,614 --> 00:18:46,409
No, no, no. I have to go.
I can't stay.

163
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,704
Listen. If you turn up at
the barracks like this,

164
00:18:49,787 --> 00:18:52,082
you'll be cleaning the toilets
for a week.

165
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,690
Oh, shit.

166
00:19:55,686 --> 00:19:58,398
Put your fucking coat on!

167
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:01,609
Why can't you dress yourself
like any other pig here?

168
00:20:05,655 --> 00:20:07,282
Lebedev.

169
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:10,535
Did I give you permission to
leave the barracks last night?

170
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:12,077
No, Comrade Sergeant.

171
00:20:12,162 --> 00:20:14,079
Then why the fuck were
you smoking outside?

172
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:23,506
What's your problem?

173
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:27,092
Why the fuck are you staring at
me with those dewy wept eyes?

174
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:29,011
- Are you a pervert?
- No, Comrade Sergeant.

175
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,930
Then why the fuck do
you look like one?

176
00:20:37,895 --> 00:20:39,605
What the fuck are you smiling at?

177
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:46,571
Go fuck up the pervert.

178
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:52,368
Go fuck up the pervert.

179
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:57,915
Are you fucking deaf?

180
00:20:57,998 --> 00:21:00,376
Go fuck up the pederast now!

181
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,963
- To the stations.
- To the stations.

182
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:05,340
This is a combative exercise.

183
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:42,042
After I'm done at the regional HQ,
I want to show you something.

184
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:44,379
- What is it?
- You'll see.

185
00:23:20,391 --> 00:23:23,185
You haven't said a word since we left.

186
00:23:25,396 --> 00:23:28,524
I hope it wasn't that bad.

187
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:33,863
No. I loved it. I'm sorry.

188
00:23:41,996 --> 00:23:46,041
Whenever I used to watch a play
with my best friend Dima.

189
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,212
I'd never want it to end.

190
00:23:51,714 --> 00:23:54,467
Dima grew up without a mother
and me without a father.

191
00:23:56,677 --> 00:23:59,514
It sort of created this
invisible bond between us.

192
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,602
We'd write secret letters to
each other and sign them Valentin.

193
00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:08,398
- Valentin?
- Zubkov.

194
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:10,858
The fighter pilot who became an actor.

195
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:13,486
We wanted to be just like him.

196
00:24:15,446 --> 00:24:19,033
We even promised we'd go to the same
drama school in Moscow together.

197
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,373
What happened?

198
00:24:30,044 --> 00:24:31,671
It was just a silly dream.

199
00:24:41,597 --> 00:24:43,849
What will you do
after you leave the base?

200
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:49,146
Go back to the farm,
support my mother, find work.

201
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:52,107
Couldn't you support her even
better if you studied in Moscow

202
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,859
and got a job at Mosfilm?

203
00:24:53,943 --> 00:24:57,112
- I'd never get in.
- How do you know?

204
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,615
Because they only take 20
people from across the country.

205
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:05,287
There are hundreds of conscripts here
but the colonel chose you.

206
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:12,169
"It is not in the stars to hold
our destiny, but in ourselves."

207
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:18,383
Shakespeare.

208
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:23,764
Pull over.
This could take a while.

209
00:25:32,523 --> 00:25:33,523
Look.

210
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:36,777
They're dancing with each other.

211
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:44,535
Oh. Shit.

212
00:25:46,704 --> 00:25:48,664
That definitely wasn't a blueberry.

213
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,754
Do you have a girl back home?

214
00:26:01,886 --> 00:26:02,970
No.

215
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:05,765
Do you?

216
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,731
Shit! Border guards.

217
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:12,725
What happened to you last night?

218
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:15,560
I thought you were going to go
after her, not ignore her even more.

219
00:28:16,646 --> 00:28:18,147
I had to drive the lieutenant.

220
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,817
That late? We waited for you.

221
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:25,612
Luisa kept going on and on
about him, so I told her to stop

222
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:28,198
and then she got mad at me
and went home.

223
00:28:28,282 --> 00:28:29,784
Where did you drive him?

224
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:32,036
He went to the theatre.

225
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,495
And then?

226
00:28:37,457 --> 00:28:39,376
Then we were delayed coming back.

227
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,757
- What?
- Sergey, you've got that look.

228
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,508
No, really. I was on duty.

229
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,719
You've found another girl, haven't you?

230
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:52,389
- Tell me, who is she?
- Swap, anyone?

231
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:54,016
Kolja, I'll swap with you.

232
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,559
Yes, Sergey.

233
00:28:56,143 --> 00:28:57,311
Come on, Sergey.

234
00:29:00,522 --> 00:29:02,692
- So, how is he?
- Who?

235
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:04,318
Lieutenant Matvejev.

236
00:29:06,862 --> 00:29:08,363
Not like the other officers.

237
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:12,868
That's what I thought.

238
00:29:15,245 --> 00:29:17,664
I have to drive him
to Tallinn this weekend.

239
00:29:17,748 --> 00:29:19,458
What do you think?
Where should I take him?

240
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,548
I could come and show him around,
if Lieutenant Matvejev doesn't mind.

241
00:29:27,842 --> 00:29:28,842
Yeah?

242
00:29:28,884 --> 00:29:30,219
- Yeah.
- Of course.

243
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:38,393
Stalin is standing in this
field, a green field,

244
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:42,106
and there's this farmer nearby,
and Stalin...

245
00:29:42,189 --> 00:29:43,315
No, the farmer...

246
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:45,478
If you insist on telling it,
at least do it properly.

247
00:29:45,525 --> 00:29:46,693
Dick.

248
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:52,491
A farm worker greets Josef
Stalin at his potato farm.

249
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:55,369
"Comrade Stalin,
we have so many potatoes that,

250
00:29:55,452 --> 00:29:58,455
"piled one on top of the other
"they would reach all the way to God,"

251
00:29:58,538 --> 00:30:00,207
the farmer excitedly tells...

252
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,966
Go on, Private Serebrennikov.

253
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:12,845
Go on. I love a good joke.

254
00:30:15,722 --> 00:30:17,099
Go on.

255
00:30:22,271 --> 00:30:24,648
"But God does not exist," replies Stalin.

256
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,317
"Exactly," says the farmer.

257
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,736
"Neither do the potatoes."

258
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,916
"Neither do the potatoes."

259
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,502
That's a good one.

260
00:30:48,463 --> 00:30:49,673
Follow me.

261
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,029
Telling jokes of that nature could
interfere greatly

262
00:31:12,112 --> 00:31:14,031
with your future prospects.

263
00:31:14,114 --> 00:31:17,952
We have immense responsibility
for how we affect society.

264
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:22,206
So I'd choose more carefully
which stories you tell.

265
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:24,333
This will never happen again,
Comrade Major.

266
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,459
I do hope so.

267
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:28,295
For your own sake.

268
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:31,882
One more thing.

269
00:31:34,384 --> 00:31:36,136
According to
the orderly's logbook,

270
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,474
on your trip to Tallinn, you
returned the Uazik at 22:34.

271
00:31:44,061 --> 00:31:46,313
What was the cause of such a delay?

272
00:31:46,396 --> 00:31:49,108
The lieutenant was attending
the theatre, Comrade Major.

273
00:31:50,234 --> 00:31:52,611
We were delayed at the crossing at Risti.

274
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:54,113
The gates were broken again.

275
00:31:54,196 --> 00:31:57,407
I did everything I could to
return as quickly as possible.

276
00:32:02,913 --> 00:32:04,353
Whom did he attend the theatre with?

277
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:08,002
The lieutenant was alone, Comrade Major.

278
00:32:11,046 --> 00:32:12,047
I see.

279
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:19,721
You will report to me

280
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:22,307
if you notice anything
outside the ordinary.

281
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:24,851
- Understood?
- Yes, Comrade Major.

282
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:28,898
Dismissed.

283
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:08,437
And the Oleviste church was the tallest
building in medieval Europe.

284
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:12,983
That there is treasure buried
under Mary's chapel.

285
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,573
Sorry.

286
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:21,616
Thank you.

287
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:31,710
How do I look?

288
00:33:34,754 --> 00:33:36,048
You are right.

289
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,931
Oh, thank you.

290
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:48,018
Would you like one?

291
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:51,105
Thank you, Comrade Lieutenant.

292
00:33:51,188 --> 00:33:54,316
And this, of course, is the
famous cobbled street

293
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,152
where Lenin had his first
pair of boots made.

294
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:58,236
Luisa?

295
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:01,490
- Olga.
- Luisa.

296
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,033
It's been years.

297
00:34:04,784 --> 00:34:07,829
- You look so good.
- You too.

298
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:08,998
Hello.

299
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,542
Which one of these handsome
men are you married to?

300
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:14,919
- Olga!
- Don't tell me.

301
00:34:15,004 --> 00:34:16,796
This one's your husband?

302
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,216
And this must be your brother.

303
00:34:19,299 --> 00:34:22,636
Olga, these are my colleagues
from the base.

304
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,138
- Oh.
- Yeah.

305
00:34:24,221 --> 00:34:25,347
Colleagues.

306
00:34:26,723 --> 00:34:28,558
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

307
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:32,604
- He's so sweet. It's your baby?
- Yes.

308
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:34,939
Comrade.

309
00:35:00,757 --> 00:35:01,966
Luisa.

310
00:35:44,218 --> 00:35:48,138
"To be or not to be.
That is the question."

311
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,192
To be,

312
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:03,153
or not to be...

313
00:36:04,571 --> 00:36:06,406
That is the question.

314
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,581
To be,

315
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,292
or not

316
00:36:19,419 --> 00:36:20,420
to be.

317
00:36:23,798 --> 00:36:24,841
That is the question.

318
00:36:24,924 --> 00:36:26,218
Shit!

319
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:29,804
Who's that?

320
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:36,603
You scared the hell out of me.

321
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:39,105
Where's Luisa?

322
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:45,320
Let's go.

323
00:37:57,058 --> 00:37:58,602
Will you help me with my lines?

324
00:38:02,689 --> 00:38:05,359
- What lines?
- For my audition.

325
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,695
Another one of your dreams.

326
00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:10,947
You know you'll end up going
back to the farm.

327
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,241
No, Luisa, I'm serious.

328
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:14,701
I sent my application.

329
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:16,995
I'm going to be an actor.

330
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:25,670
I can't wait to see you on stage, then.

331
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:27,756
Let's do the reports, then your lines.

332
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,428
Petrov 1:05.

333
00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:36,598
Tokarev 0:52.

334
00:38:37,974 --> 00:38:39,058
Matvejev...

335
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,733
- Comrade Lieutenant.
- At ease.

336
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,365
A little something.

337
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:55,867
Sergey here told me
how well your exam went.

338
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,329
You shouldn't have,
Lieutenant Matvejev.

339
00:38:59,413 --> 00:39:00,497
I'll be right back.

340
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,176
Where were we?

341
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:18,348
Er... Selenov 1:25.

342
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:21,017
Yes, Comrade Colonel?

343
00:39:23,353 --> 00:39:24,688
He's ready for you.

344
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,860
He is different.

345
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:36,282
Platonov.

346
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:39,285
You exceeded all your targets
last week.

347
00:39:41,663 --> 00:39:42,664
Excellent.

348
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,000
- That is all.
- Not quite.

349
00:39:48,837 --> 00:39:49,921
One more thing.

350
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:55,009
Lieutenant Matvejev,

351
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:59,514
are you familiar with Article
154A of the Criminal Code?

352
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:00,974
No, Comrade Major. I'm not.

353
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:06,312
Sexual relations of a man
with another man,

354
00:40:06,396 --> 00:40:10,650
which is punishable by five years'
imprisonment in a hard-lab our camp.

355
00:40:12,652 --> 00:40:14,028
I'm not following,
Comrade Major.

356
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:20,910
A report has been received
implying you have engaged in

357
00:40:20,994 --> 00:40:22,704
immoral conduct with a private.

358
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,374
- This is malicious gossip.
- Lieutenant Matvejev.

359
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:31,254
I wouldn't recommend
you interrupt me again.

360
00:40:35,717 --> 00:40:38,344
There was no name of
the private in question.

361
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:42,265
Give me his name.

362
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,937
There is no name to give.

363
00:40:48,855 --> 00:40:51,065
It is a lie.
I assure you, comrades.

364
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:53,777
Consider your words,
Lieutenant Matvejev.

365
00:40:54,903 --> 00:40:55,987
Comrade Major

366
00:40:58,364 --> 00:40:59,866
who wrote this?

367
00:40:59,949 --> 00:41:03,077
It was delivered anonymously,
unsigned.

368
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:04,162
Without hon our.

369
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,082
I trust the lieutenant's word.

370
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,752
Dismissed.

371
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,048
Yes, Comrade Colonel.

372
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:16,174
Lieutenant.

373
00:41:19,886 --> 00:41:21,262
It would be a pity.

374
00:41:30,229 --> 00:41:34,067
So, when you buy a brand-new Soviet car,
what do you get for free?

375
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,945
- I have no idea.
- Train and bus timetable.

376
00:41:38,488 --> 00:41:41,074
- I have a good one, too.
- I have to go.

377
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:48,707
So, where's my gift?

378
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,961
Sergey.
Listen to me and don't react.

379
00:41:57,173 --> 00:41:58,800
Someone filed a report.

380
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:01,636
- About us.
- What?

381
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,056
They didn't mention your name
but...

382
00:42:09,102 --> 00:42:11,062
But the KGB know something.

383
00:42:11,938 --> 00:42:13,147
You better go, Sergey.

384
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,165
Oh, no. False alarm.

385
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:33,960
All personnel to stations.
This is a red alert.

386
00:42:34,043 --> 00:42:36,671
I repeat, this is a red alert.

387
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:38,965
This is not a training exercise.

388
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,638
- Attention.
- At ease.

389
00:42:44,721 --> 00:42:47,766
Comrade Colonel, we have four
B-52 strategic nuclear bombers

390
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:50,685
in neutral air space,
on a direct flight path to Leningrad.

391
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:52,729
011 and 023 are escorting.

392
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,776
Rock. 011.30 seconds to the border.
Permission to engage?

393
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:00,278
011. Negative. Do not engage.

394
00:43:00,361 --> 00:43:02,030
I repeat, do not engage.

395
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:04,157
Ten seconds to the border.

396
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,576
Rock. 011. Awaiting orders.

397
00:43:10,664 --> 00:43:13,457
Wait. Targets diverting
90 degrees north.

398
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:16,628
011 and 023, continue escorting.

399
00:43:20,006 --> 00:43:22,383
Rock. 011. Engine malfunction.

400
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,844
011. Status report?

401
00:43:24,928 --> 00:43:27,806
Power at 30, declining.
Cooling negative.

402
00:43:27,889 --> 00:43:30,058
I've lost the engine.
Permission to abort.

403
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:34,604
All stations, we have an emergency.

404
00:43:34,688 --> 00:43:39,651
011, drop your weapons and fuel tanks.
023, mark the coordinates.

405
00:43:39,734 --> 00:43:42,028
Mark. 85km.

406
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:43,321
10,200.

407
00:43:43,404 --> 00:43:47,075
That gives him a range of 73km.

408
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:48,618
He'll crash at least 10km short.

409
00:43:48,702 --> 00:43:51,079
011, negative.

410
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:54,040
Proceed to eject over the sea at 3,000.

411
00:43:54,123 --> 00:43:56,876
I can save the plane.
I can fly it at stall speed.

412
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,753
Damn it, he's trying to land.

413
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,592
Matvejey, it's too risky.
I need you to return alive.

414
00:44:03,675 --> 00:44:05,635
Eject. That's an order.

415
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:07,762
I do not copy.
Parachute negative.

416
00:44:07,846 --> 00:44:08,888
Mark. Parachute negative.

417
00:44:08,972 --> 00:44:10,514
Activate the stop net.

418
00:44:11,641 --> 00:44:12,642
Duty mechanic to control.

419
00:44:14,268 --> 00:44:16,062
Duty mechanic to control.

420
00:44:16,145 --> 00:44:19,273
- Karamazin, Serebrennikov, to the net. Go.
- Yes, Comrade Colonel.

421
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:37,458
Come on.

422
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,918
- Come on!
- What is it?

423
00:44:41,921 --> 00:44:43,589
Shit. The fuse is blown.

424
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,972
The crank!

425
00:44:53,141 --> 00:44:54,350
Damn it!

426
00:44:58,897 --> 00:44:59,981
It won't move!

427
00:45:01,315 --> 00:45:04,235
Rock. 011. Airfield in sight.

428
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:06,780
- Permission to land?
- 011, permission granted.

429
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:12,661
Try now!

430
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:17,916
Come on. Come on.

431
00:45:22,837 --> 00:45:24,088
Faster.

432
00:45:29,803 --> 00:45:31,012
It's going. Run!

433
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:53,284
Faster. Faster. Get back to
your station, Private.

434
00:45:54,911 --> 00:45:56,370
Serebrennikoy, let's go.

435
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:58,539
You! You! You!
Get him out of there!

436
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:30,905
All clear, Lieutenant Matvejev.

437
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:33,657
You were very lucky today.
Get some rest.

438
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:01,811
Comrade Lieutenant?

439
00:47:04,272 --> 00:47:05,439
Up here.

440
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:48,644
For you.

441
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:52,273
So you won't forget me.

442
00:50:02,283 --> 00:50:04,743
We could get the training plane
and fly to Sweden.

443
00:50:06,955 --> 00:50:08,039
Sweden?

444
00:50:09,748 --> 00:50:11,792
Why Sweden?

445
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,586
I don't know.

446
00:50:13,669 --> 00:50:14,712
I don't care

447
00:50:15,921 --> 00:50:17,548
as long as we're together.

448
00:50:17,631 --> 00:50:19,217
Sergey, I'm an officer.

449
00:50:20,426 --> 00:50:22,428
I can't leave my motherland.

450
00:50:36,275 --> 00:50:40,529
If you get into drama school.

451
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:45,034
.I'll find something to do
in Moscow, too.

452
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:53,792
And then we could go to the
cinema whenever we wanted.

453
00:50:55,919 --> 00:51:02,426
And take a cruise on the river
and watch all the shows at the Bolshoi.

454
00:51:03,802 --> 00:51:06,055
And have an ice cream on Arbat,

455
00:51:06,139 --> 00:51:08,766
and then throw up on
the American Mountains.

456
00:51:08,849 --> 00:51:10,268
That's decided, then.

457
00:51:11,352 --> 00:51:12,436
All right, then.

458
00:51:30,746 --> 00:51:32,206
Comrade Major.

459
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,624
At ease.

460
00:51:36,377 --> 00:51:38,379
Sounds like you're having fun in here.

461
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:41,799
Just analysing my flight report,
Comrade Major.

462
00:51:46,512 --> 00:51:49,182
- Alone?
- Yes, Comrade Major.

463
00:51:52,518 --> 00:51:53,852
I see.

464
00:52:13,456 --> 00:52:15,291
Where did you develop these?

465
00:52:18,627 --> 00:52:20,838
Just personal photos, Comrade Major.

466
00:52:21,922 --> 00:52:23,507
Personal.

467
00:53:31,659 --> 00:53:32,826
Matvejev

468
00:53:33,702 --> 00:53:36,664
if there is the slightest
truth in that report

469
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,043
believe me, I will find out.

470
00:53:42,336 --> 00:53:45,964
And nobody can protect you
then, not even Kuznetsov.

471
00:53:48,676 --> 00:53:51,929
And I'll personally make sure
that you'll never fly again.

472
00:53:54,973 --> 00:53:56,141
Goodnight.

473
00:54:20,999 --> 00:54:22,960
You better return to the barracks now.

474
00:54:24,753 --> 00:54:26,505
Make sure nobody sees you.

475
00:54:34,763 --> 00:54:39,059
Faster! Move it!

476
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:41,437
Fucking rats.

477
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,021
Move it!

478
00:54:43,105 --> 00:54:46,234
Won't have to listen to him
ever again. One more day.

479
00:55:01,415 --> 00:55:02,416
Good luck.

480
00:55:16,805 --> 00:55:18,056
Comrade Lieutenant.

481
00:55:21,394 --> 00:55:22,770
Vasja, wait here.

482
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:24,772
Colonel's orders.

483
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:25,981
Comrade Lieutenant?

484
00:55:28,317 --> 00:55:30,986
- Comrade Lieutenant?
- What is it, Private?

485
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:32,780
I made a plan.

486
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,073
- What plan?
- For Moscow.

487
00:55:35,157 --> 00:55:37,326
Get back to your station, Private.

488
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:39,328
What?

489
00:55:39,412 --> 00:55:41,079
- Last night...
- Listen...

490
00:55:41,163 --> 00:55:43,332
Comrade Serebrennikov.

491
00:55:43,416 --> 00:55:45,042
There was no last night.

492
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:47,420
Nothing ever happened
between us. Nothing.

493
00:55:48,462 --> 00:55:49,880
Understand?

494
00:56:44,352 --> 00:56:46,812
Moscow? Moscow is where I'll be.

495
00:56:46,895 --> 00:56:48,647
I'll hold you to that.

496
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:50,858
Vasja.

497
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:54,695
Sergey

498
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:57,865
don't forget - write to me
after your auditions.

499
00:56:57,948 --> 00:56:59,116
Of course.

500
00:57:14,882 --> 00:57:16,800
Take care.

501
00:57:54,212 --> 00:57:57,508
O, happy dagger.
This is thy sheath.

502
00:57:59,134 --> 00:58:01,887
There rust, and let me die.

503
00:58:09,394 --> 00:58:11,354
Let's try again.

504
00:58:20,948 --> 00:58:25,828
If Juliet had just married Paris,
who's smart and wealthy, the man of wax,

505
00:58:25,911 --> 00:58:28,371
then this terrible tragedy
would never have happened.

506
00:58:28,456 --> 00:58:30,791
That's love for convenience.
That's not true love.

507
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:34,086
Oh, really?
And how does true love behave?

508
00:58:34,169 --> 00:58:36,630
You can't stop thinking about
the other person.

509
00:58:36,714 --> 00:58:38,591
You have to be with them
no matter what.

510
00:58:38,674 --> 00:58:41,969
But she could save both their lives,
and they could still meet up in secret.

511
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:43,721
And only live half a life?

512
00:58:43,804 --> 00:58:49,184
Romeo doesn't just go "I defy you stars"
to see her in secret.

513
00:58:49,267 --> 00:58:50,853
Not when he's madly in love.

514
00:58:54,773 --> 00:58:56,399
I've got to get to my class.

515
00:58:57,485 --> 00:58:58,944
Wait. I'll walk with you.

516
00:59:01,279 --> 00:59:03,491
Have you got time to go over
our scenes later?

517
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:05,325
We could practise at my place.

518
00:59:06,368 --> 00:59:09,371
I can't tonight. I have to
practise my monologue.

519
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:14,668
Sergey, there you are.
Your friend is here.

520
00:59:16,211 --> 00:59:17,212
I'll see you later.

521
00:59:23,051 --> 00:59:24,052
Luisa.

522
00:59:30,809 --> 00:59:32,310
Look at you.

523
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:34,146
You've become so handsome.

524
00:59:34,229 --> 00:59:35,606
All that time in the library.

525
00:59:35,689 --> 00:59:38,275
- Oh.
- Oh, and edible food.

526
00:59:55,834 --> 00:59:57,628
Your mother still looks so young.

527
01:00:02,424 --> 01:00:04,009
How is she?

528
01:00:04,092 --> 01:00:06,136
Oh, she's... She's fine.

529
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:13,101
Anyway, you've heard all my news.
How is medical school?

530
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:18,899
I deferred. I'll go next autumn.

531
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:19,983
Why?

532
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,029
I'm still working for the colonel.

533
01:00:32,537 --> 01:00:34,289
The days are flying by.

534
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,087
Sergey, so much changed
after you left the base.

535
01:00:41,922 --> 01:00:43,423
I needed to come and see you.

536
01:00:45,926 --> 01:00:48,178
I don't want
anything to change between us.

537
01:00:50,889 --> 01:00:52,099
Of course.

538
01:00:53,225 --> 01:00:55,060
- Thanks.
- What is it?

539
01:00:59,564 --> 01:01:01,316
I am to be married

540
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:05,445
to Roman.

541
01:01:11,619 --> 01:01:12,953
Roman?

542
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:17,708
Well, that's...

543
01:01:19,918 --> 01:01:21,086
You're sure?

544
01:01:22,755 --> 01:01:24,089
Of course.

545
01:01:25,257 --> 01:01:26,675
Of course I'm sure.

546
01:01:30,137 --> 01:01:31,639
That's wonderful.

547
01:01:33,766 --> 01:01:35,225
I'm truly happy for you.

548
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,061
For both of you.

549
01:01:41,231 --> 01:01:42,900
I missed you so much.

550
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:50,573
You will come to our wedding,
won't you?

551
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:56,413
- Sugar?
- Yes.

552
01:02:35,202 --> 01:02:37,245
A toast to Sergey.

553
01:02:37,329 --> 01:02:39,998
We are all here today thanks to you.

554
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:42,084
Na zdarovje.

555
01:02:42,167 --> 01:02:44,544
- Na zdarovije.
- Na zdarovije.

556
01:02:48,256 --> 01:02:49,800
One more?

557
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:10,112
Hey-hey! Gorko!

558
01:03:10,195 --> 01:03:13,156
Gorko! Gorko!

559
01:03:17,535 --> 01:03:21,206
Two, three, four,

560
01:03:21,289 --> 01:03:24,459
five, six, seven!

561
01:03:47,482 --> 01:03:52,279
Difficult thing to watch the one you love
swept off their feet.

562
01:03:55,073 --> 01:03:57,159
I see what goes on
under my nose.

563
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:03,206
It's no consolation now but

564
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:08,545
if he'd never walked onto my base,
I do believe

565
01:04:10,755 --> 01:04:12,674
she would have married you.

566
01:04:20,057 --> 01:04:22,142
Thank you, Comrade Colonel.

567
01:04:38,992 --> 01:04:40,743
Excuse me.

568
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:06,686
How have you been?

569
01:05:11,399 --> 01:05:12,400
Fine.

570
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:16,363
How is drama school?

571
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:20,742
It's a lot better than the base.

572
01:05:23,871 --> 01:05:25,122
It's like another world.

573
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,792
Have you got a girl?

574
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:39,719
Do you love her?

575
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:42,305
Of course.

576
01:05:45,392 --> 01:05:47,269
She's given up everything
for you.

577
01:05:47,352 --> 01:05:50,063
- I had to protect you.
- From what?

578
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:52,190
You know what happens to men like you.

579
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:56,028
Men... like me?

580
01:05:57,905 --> 01:05:59,114
What are you, then?

581
01:06:01,033 --> 01:06:02,450
I just married the woman I love.

582
01:06:02,534 --> 01:06:04,614
You really believe that
if you live a lie long enough

583
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:06,246
- it'll suddenly become true?
- Sergey

584
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,916
you don't know anything about me.

585
01:06:12,419 --> 01:06:14,504
Wait. Sergey.

586
01:06:14,587 --> 01:06:17,174
Gorko!

587
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,138
I tried.

588
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:25,682
Sso hard

589
01:06:26,891 --> 01:06:28,185
to forget you.

590
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:31,729
But I can't.

591
01:06:34,316 --> 01:06:35,650
- All these months, I...
- Sergey.

592
01:06:35,733 --> 01:06:37,235
- Waited.
- Sergey.

593
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:38,528
I thought you'd come.

594
01:06:40,822 --> 01:06:42,115
I couldn't.

595
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:04,429
What are you doing?

596
01:07:15,607 --> 01:07:16,733
Comrade Major.

597
01:07:28,453 --> 01:07:30,122
Your wife is looking for you.

598
01:07:30,205 --> 01:07:32,874
Thank you, Comrade Major.
I'll be right there.

599
01:07:49,474 --> 01:07:51,101
I must go, Sergey.

600
01:07:51,184 --> 01:07:52,977
We could still go to Moscow together.

601
01:07:54,562 --> 01:07:55,855
Nobody would have to know.

602
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:00,360
- Have that ice cream on Arbat.
- Sergey.

603
01:08:03,655 --> 01:08:04,697
Luisa is

604
01:08:06,741 --> 01:08:07,950
pregnant.

605
01:08:26,303 --> 01:08:29,639
"You have sense enough",
said Father Zossima.

606
01:08:31,391 --> 01:08:33,893
"Don't give way to drunkenness

607
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:36,979
"and incontinence of speech.

608
01:08:37,064 --> 01:08:41,484
"Don't give way to sensual lust
"and to the love of money.

609
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:44,071
"And above all"

610
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:46,573
"don't lie."

611
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:48,575
"You mean about Diderot?"

612
01:08:48,658 --> 01:08:51,536
"No, not about Diderot."

613
01:08:51,619 --> 01:08:54,747
"Above all, don't lie to yourself."

614
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:59,211
"The man who lies to himself,"

615
01:08:59,294 --> 01:09:03,090
"and listens to his own lie
comes to the point"

616
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:04,983
"that he cannot distinguish
the truth within him"

617
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:07,927
- "Daddy!
- " or around him.

618
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:12,014
"And so loses all respect for
himself and for others."

619
01:09:12,682 --> 01:09:15,352
"And having no respect"

620
01:09:15,435 --> 01:09:17,354
"he ceases to love."

621
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:30,783
Dinner is ready.

622
01:09:48,176 --> 01:09:49,511
It won't be a holiday.

623
01:09:49,594 --> 01:09:52,805
I'll be doing long hours.
You'd be alone in the city all day.

624
01:09:52,889 --> 01:09:55,558
I think it would be
better for you to stay here.

625
01:09:55,642 --> 01:09:58,228
But I don't want to be stuck here.

626
01:09:58,311 --> 01:09:59,604
And he'll miss his daddy.

627
01:09:59,687 --> 01:10:01,814
You have your family here
to help you.

628
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:03,441
Just for a few months.

629
01:10:03,525 --> 01:10:04,984
- Did you think about us?
- Yes.

630
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:06,067
And?

631
01:10:06,111 --> 01:10:08,155
When I finish in Moscow,
they'll promote me.

632
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:10,490
And we can finally get
a bigger apartment.

633
01:10:14,952 --> 01:10:18,373
- Do I have a say in this?
- It's for the best.

634
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:25,380
Have you seen my jumper?

635
01:10:25,463 --> 01:10:27,549
- Which one?
- The grey winter one.

636
01:10:30,885 --> 01:10:32,387
Why do you have to go?

637
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:35,557
Serjozha, I'll see you soon.

638
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:40,520
- You are both mean.
- Serjozha...

639
01:11:05,337 --> 01:11:07,339
- This one?
- Yes.

640
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:10,592
And that's why I love you.

641
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:18,641
I should just make it to the train.

642
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:29,819
See you soon.

643
01:11:50,548 --> 01:11:51,799
Prison, my lord?

644
01:11:53,134 --> 01:11:54,594
Denmark's a prison.

645
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:56,804
Then is the world one?

646
01:11:57,430 --> 01:12:02,184
A goodly one, in which there are many
confines, wards, dungeons.

647
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:04,604
Denmark being one of the worst.

648
01:12:06,939 --> 01:12:08,232
We think not so, my lord.

649
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:11,068
Why, then, 'tis none to you,

650
01:12:11,152 --> 01:12:14,155
for there is nothing either good or bad
but thinking makes it so.

651
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:17,700
To me

652
01:12:17,784 --> 01:12:19,286
it is a prison.

653
01:12:20,244 --> 01:12:22,455
I'm going to read all his
books during the break.

654
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,376
That better not be all you'll be doing.

655
01:12:26,459 --> 01:12:28,336
I'll make sure it won't be.

656
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:31,172
Or I'll throw his books
into the river again.

657
01:12:32,173 --> 01:12:34,384
Sergey? You have a visitor.

658
01:12:47,605 --> 01:12:48,856
What are you doing here?

659
01:12:51,275 --> 01:12:54,153
I... came to see your play.

660
01:12:58,908 --> 01:13:00,076
Did you like it?

661
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:07,917
The prince

662
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,251
was very good.

663
01:13:13,465 --> 01:13:14,507
Thank you.

664
01:13:29,146 --> 01:13:30,147
Sergey

665
01:13:31,315 --> 01:13:33,109
I've been sorting out my apartment,

666
01:13:33,192 --> 01:13:36,613
so I have a week off
before I start at the academy.

667
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,617
Why are you telling me this?

668
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:43,119
Didn't you get my letter?

669
01:13:46,664 --> 01:13:49,417
How's your wife,

670
01:13:49,501 --> 01:13:50,585
and your child?

671
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:53,671
Come to Sochi with me.

672
01:13:54,881 --> 01:13:56,173
I have two tickets.

673
01:14:01,012 --> 01:14:03,055
For the 1800 train.

674
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:05,600
You think you can just turn up
here and I'll drop my life?

675
01:14:06,559 --> 01:14:08,561
What was it,
could she not join you?

676
01:14:09,854 --> 01:14:10,854
Sergey.

677
01:14:13,483 --> 01:14:14,776
I'll be right there, llya.

678
01:14:22,742 --> 01:14:24,577
I've got to get back to my friends.

679
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:33,252
Why do you think we use
the classics to teach you?

680
01:14:34,921 --> 01:14:39,426
Because the characters
of these stories

681
01:14:39,509 --> 01:14:41,553
are not intellectuals.

682
01:14:42,679 --> 01:14:46,348
They are living, breathing

683
01:14:47,642 --> 01:14:49,268
feeling beings

684
01:14:50,937 --> 01:14:54,023
whom are tender,

685
01:14:54,106 --> 01:14:55,942
with tremble

686
01:14:57,777 --> 01:14:59,529
in their hearts.

687
01:14:59,612 --> 01:15:06,368
And I want you to catch this tremble
to your own heart and soul.

688
01:15:17,254 --> 01:15:18,590
Tea?

689
01:15:19,966 --> 01:15:24,637
Train 505 for Sochi is departing
now from platform two.

690
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:26,115
- He's still with that model?
- Yeah.

691
01:16:27,659 --> 01:16:30,244
And she came with him to visit Luisa.

692
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:35,958
How is she?

693
01:16:37,627 --> 01:16:40,337
Later, Sergey. Later.

694
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:09,158
Come on!

695
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,259
Roman?

696
01:17:43,735 --> 01:17:45,527
I'm afraid of this dream.

697
01:17:49,281 --> 01:17:50,574
Of waking up.

698
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:54,120
Of losing you.

699
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:58,582
I'm here now.

700
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:07,091
What is it?

701
01:18:09,927 --> 01:18:12,930
You remember my best friend, Dima?

702
01:18:19,687 --> 01:18:21,272
On his 13th birthday

703
01:18:22,982 --> 01:18:24,817
my mother made him an apple pie.

704
01:18:27,987 --> 01:18:29,280
He lived by the school.

705
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,994
I wanted him to have it
while it was still warm.

706
01:18:36,788 --> 01:18:38,164
So I ran all the way.

707
01:18:41,042 --> 01:18:42,209
When I arrived.

708
01:18:43,502 --> 01:18:46,172
I heard shouting from inside,

709
01:18:46,255 --> 01:18:47,840
and so I went around
to the window.

710
01:18:52,428 --> 01:18:54,681
My letters were scattered
all over the floor.

711
01:19:00,227 --> 01:19:03,940
His father had him pinned to the table.

712
01:19:06,358 --> 01:19:08,194
Beating him across the back

713
01:19:09,946 --> 01:19:13,615
yelling, "No son of mine
will be a fucking faggot."

714
01:19:19,038 --> 01:19:20,539
I'll never forget his look

715
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,376
of disgust.

716
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:32,760
And then Dima looked up,

717
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:35,221
and saw me.

718
01:19:39,016 --> 01:19:40,810
And I ran away.

719
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:46,858
I ran away.

720
01:19:55,867 --> 01:19:57,952
He didn't come to school the next day.

721
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:05,752
There's a lake
in the forest near the village.

722
01:20:09,964 --> 01:20:12,091
They found his body there
three days later.

723
01:20:17,764 --> 01:20:19,766
I've never told this to anyone.

724
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:49,086
I have three rules here.

725
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:54,425
No vodka, no parties with loud music,
and no girls.

726
01:20:57,678 --> 01:20:59,180
After 11.

727
01:21:04,977 --> 01:21:08,147
This place is incredible.

728
01:21:14,111 --> 01:21:15,196
Welcome home.

729
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:34,590
As you requested.
The sickle and the hammer.

730
01:21:34,673 --> 01:21:38,845
First, it cuts off your legs
and then it smacks you in the head.

731
01:21:38,928 --> 01:21:40,804
- A drink?
- Need you ask?

732
01:21:40,888 --> 01:21:42,306
Look at this place.

733
01:21:42,389 --> 01:21:45,017
Fighter pilots certainly
make lots of money.

734
01:21:45,101 --> 01:21:46,560
Na zdarovje.

735
01:21:46,643 --> 01:21:48,145
Na zdarovje.

736
01:22:14,505 --> 01:22:17,299
Sergey is always so serious
about it all.

737
01:22:17,383 --> 01:22:20,677
He'll play Hamlet or Uncle
Vanya the rest of his life.

738
01:22:20,761 --> 01:22:22,681
- Yeah, you are right.
- Nothing wrong with that.

739
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:27,059
- Matvejev. Fuel is running out.
- Coming right up.

740
01:22:28,435 --> 01:22:30,271
Sergey.

741
01:22:30,354 --> 01:22:31,605
Sorry.

742
01:22:41,448 --> 01:22:43,159
Who'd have thought it?

743
01:22:43,242 --> 01:22:47,038
Actors and pilots getting along so well.

744
01:22:47,121 --> 01:22:49,290
I can't imagine it any other way.

745
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,628
- I knew it.
- No.

746
01:22:57,589 --> 01:22:58,674
Volodja.

747
01:23:00,968 --> 01:23:02,970
- Volodja.
- Get the fuck away from me.

748
01:23:03,054 --> 01:23:04,763
- Volodja.
- I knew it.

749
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:07,474
Zverev should have
investigated my report.

750
01:23:10,602 --> 01:23:11,770
You?

751
01:23:13,564 --> 01:23:15,066
You could have got us sent to prison.

752
01:23:15,149 --> 01:23:17,568
How was I supposed to know
it was you?

753
01:23:19,236 --> 01:23:21,488
Why would you do this to her?

754
01:23:21,572 --> 01:23:23,615
You've ruined her life.

755
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:25,117
Volodja...

756
01:23:26,285 --> 01:23:29,246
- We love each other.
- Stop. Stop it.

757
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:31,373
- We love...
- Stop it. It is not love.

758
01:23:32,833 --> 01:23:33,834
It's disgusting.

759
01:23:36,087 --> 01:23:37,379
You make me sick.

760
01:23:39,631 --> 01:23:41,050
Fuck this.

761
01:23:42,218 --> 01:23:44,303
You won't tell anyone.

762
01:23:45,972 --> 01:23:48,432
Not Luisa. Not anyone.

763
01:23:49,683 --> 01:23:52,478
No. That is your job.

764
01:23:54,563 --> 01:23:58,985
You really think he's going to
leave her and the air force,

765
01:23:59,068 --> 01:24:00,152
for you?

766
01:24:07,576 --> 01:24:10,287
More Soviet volunteers arrived
in Kabul this week

767
01:24:10,371 --> 01:24:12,373
to liberate the people of
Afghanistan.

768
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:18,504
The Afghani children welcomed the Soviet
soldiers with love and national dances.

769
01:24:18,587 --> 01:24:21,548
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

770
01:24:22,591 --> 01:24:25,427
- He won't tell her.
- That's good.

771
01:25:09,012 --> 01:25:10,514
Are you expecting someone?

772
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,357
Matvejev?

773
01:25:20,441 --> 01:25:22,318
- Roman Alekseyevich?
- Yes.

774
01:25:25,196 --> 01:25:26,197
Sign here.

775
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:58,479
What are you waiting for?

776
01:26:02,108 --> 01:26:06,153
Sergey, please. Go and get
the rest of your stuff.

777
01:26:07,238 --> 01:26:09,531
Roman, she can't come here.

778
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:17,331
- I can't tell her to go back.
- Then take her to a hotel.

779
01:26:17,414 --> 01:26:18,665
She's my wife.

780
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:21,585
You're an actor. Act

781
01:26:22,628 --> 01:26:24,255
like you're just visiting.

782
01:26:25,297 --> 01:26:29,176
I have to pretend every fucking second
\of the day I walk out the door.

783
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:31,220
I will not do it in our home.

784
01:26:31,303 --> 01:26:33,180
Just tell her it's not working.

785
01:26:33,264 --> 01:26:34,973
And then what?

786
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:36,225
What then?

787
01:26:36,308 --> 01:26:39,186
You'll move in with me at the base?

788
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:03,419
Hey, get to the back.

789
01:28:01,393 --> 01:28:03,186
Sergey!

790
01:28:07,233 --> 01:28:09,943
- It's so good to see you.
- Yes.

791
01:28:10,026 --> 01:28:12,028
This is Serjozha.

792
01:28:12,112 --> 01:28:14,114
- Hello.
- Hi, Serjozha.

793
01:28:14,197 --> 01:28:15,115
Hi.

794
01:28:15,198 --> 01:28:17,243
He's definitely got Roman's eyes.

795
01:28:17,326 --> 01:28:19,370
- Hasn't he?
- Yes.

796
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:22,789
How have you been?

797
01:28:22,873 --> 01:28:24,726
I was supposed to go to my
mother's for the holidays

798
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:27,210
but when Roman said that
you were coming,

799
01:28:27,294 --> 01:28:29,170
I just had to stay and see you.

800
01:28:29,921 --> 01:28:33,509
You are always welcome in
our home and you know it.

801
01:28:33,592 --> 01:28:35,969
It's about time that you met
Serjozha too.

802
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:38,013
Let's see.

803
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,807
Such a big flat. Come on.

804
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:16,802
When Roma has his night flights,
Serjozha sits by the window

805
01:29:16,885 --> 01:29:20,013
and stares into the night,
waiting for him to come home.

806
01:29:20,556 --> 01:29:21,807
Yeah.

807
01:29:27,688 --> 01:29:31,775
When Roma finishes here,
I'll start my medical school.

808
01:29:32,693 --> 01:29:34,820
And he'll get a transfer.

809
01:29:34,903 --> 01:29:36,279
- Yes.
- Yes.

810
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:39,575
Of course.

811
01:29:39,658 --> 01:29:41,452
You have to be with the ones you love.

812
01:29:42,202 --> 01:29:43,370
Yes.

813
01:29:48,709 --> 01:29:50,126
Sergey

814
01:29:50,919 --> 01:29:53,714
is there anybody special
in your life?

815
01:30:03,139 --> 01:30:04,139
Him.

816
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:09,062
And you.

817
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:15,861
And dear Serjozha.

818
01:30:17,153 --> 01:30:18,905
May you have all the blessings of love.

819
01:30:20,866 --> 01:30:22,618
Nothing and...

820
01:30:22,701 --> 01:30:23,869
And no-one

821
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:27,205
will ever replace you.

822
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:30,959
To your love.

823
01:30:32,919 --> 01:30:34,838
To being with those who you truly love.

824
01:30:37,883 --> 01:30:39,551
To your beautiful family.

825
01:30:40,594 --> 01:30:41,970
- Thank you, Sergey.
- Thank you.

826
01:30:45,807 --> 01:30:48,685
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

827
01:30:51,522 --> 01:30:54,190
May it be the happiest year yet.

828
01:31:00,363 --> 01:31:02,032
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

829
01:31:44,115 --> 01:31:45,200
Roman.

830
01:31:46,452 --> 01:31:49,621
You belong with your family.
You always did.

831
01:31:50,914 --> 01:31:54,876
I won't be the one to take you
away from your son, and from Luisa.

832
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,675
- Don't you dare touch me.
- Luisa, let me explain.

833
01:32:01,758 --> 01:32:02,926
- Leave me alone.
- Calm down.

834
01:32:03,009 --> 01:32:04,636
- Get away from me.
- Luisa!

835
01:32:07,097 --> 01:32:09,099
I know now that our love
can only exist

836
01:32:09,182 --> 01:32:11,810
where there is no thought
and no time.

837
01:32:17,483 --> 01:32:18,567
Please

838
01:32:19,818 --> 01:32:21,487
don't come looking for me.

839
01:32:41,131 --> 01:32:44,050
- Did you order a long-distance call?
- Yes, I did.

840
01:32:45,552 --> 01:32:48,304
- Kuznetsov.
- Captain Matvejev reporting.

841
01:33:03,904 --> 01:33:05,030
Sergey.

842
01:33:08,116 --> 01:33:10,118
Where did you disappear to?

843
01:33:10,201 --> 01:33:11,703
Oh, I

844
01:33:11,787 --> 01:33:13,997
went home to see my mother.

845
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:17,417
- Roman came looking for you.
- When?

846
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:20,503
Last month,
just before he left Moscow.

847
01:33:20,587 --> 01:33:24,049
Oh, he gave me a letter for you.
I put it with your mail.

848
01:33:42,818 --> 01:33:45,361
- Kuznetsov.
- Comrade Colonel.

849
01:33:46,613 --> 01:33:48,448
Private Serebrennikov calling.

850
01:33:48,531 --> 01:33:49,950
Serebrennikov.

851
01:33:51,367 --> 01:33:53,494
It's been a long time.

852
01:33:53,579 --> 01:33:55,080
I'm sorry to disturb you.

853
01:33:55,163 --> 01:33:58,083
Do you know how
I might reach Captain Matvejev?

854
01:33:58,875 --> 01:34:00,586
I must speak with him urgently.

855
01:34:02,754 --> 01:34:03,797
Matvejev?

856
01:34:06,925 --> 01:34:09,219
Didn't Luisa call you?

857
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:16,476
He left for Afghanistan
shortly after the New Year.

858
01:34:17,894 --> 01:34:22,733
He was assigned to escort convoys
from the border to the compound.

859
01:34:26,152 --> 01:34:27,613
Last Monday...

860
01:34:30,406 --> 01:34:32,450
Sergey, we lost him.

861
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:35,411
No.

862
01:34:38,707 --> 01:34:39,958
That can't be.

863
01:34:43,962 --> 01:34:45,546
Sergey...

864
01:34:52,095 --> 01:34:53,221
Sergey...

865
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:07,653
To speak and to do,
to think and to live...

866
01:35:08,236 --> 01:35:10,405
They are not the same thing, Sergey.

867
01:35:12,282 --> 01:35:14,492
By the time you receive this letter,

868
01:35:14,575 --> 01:35:17,120
I will have left for Afghanistan.

869
01:35:20,749 --> 01:35:24,920
The three days that Kuznetsov gave me
to consider are coming to an end.

870
01:35:26,004 --> 01:35:27,630
But what is there to consider?

871
01:35:28,799 --> 01:35:31,968
I can't choose for fear of
hurting those I love.

872
01:35:33,344 --> 01:35:37,933
I can't divide myself any longer
and belong to everyone at the same time.

873
01:36:00,997 --> 01:36:02,373
Come in.

874
01:36:06,252 --> 01:36:09,630
Nadja, will you have lunch with us?

875
01:36:37,408 --> 01:36:38,785
Why have you come here?

876
01:36:42,247 --> 01:36:43,832
- Luisa, I wanted to...
- To what?

877
01:36:46,292 --> 01:36:48,669
To tell me that our friendship
meant nothing to you?

878
01:36:52,758 --> 01:36:55,551
To tell me that you were
sleeping with my husband?

879
01:36:57,763 --> 01:36:58,930
I'm so sorry.

880
01:37:02,392 --> 01:37:06,604
Tell his son that you are sorry.
I don't want to hear it.

881
01:37:08,689 --> 01:37:11,692
Since you wanted
to sleep with him so badly

882
01:37:12,986 --> 01:37:15,066
why don't you go and lie
next to him in his grave?

883
01:37:16,489 --> 01:37:19,910
Oh, of course you don't even know
where your true love is buried.

884
01:37:21,744 --> 01:37:23,830
Why would they have told you?

885
01:37:23,914 --> 01:37:25,706
You're not his widow.

886
01:37:27,125 --> 01:37:28,293
What were you to him?

887
01:37:31,421 --> 01:37:32,672
You were nothing.

888
01:37:36,927 --> 01:37:39,345
Then why did he move
to Moscow to be with me?

889
01:37:39,429 --> 01:37:42,057
Stop it. Stop it, Sergey.

890
01:37:43,183 --> 01:37:44,309
No.

891
01:37:44,392 --> 01:37:46,602
What you felt,

892
01:37:46,686 --> 01:37:49,272
and what I felt was the same thing.

893
01:37:50,523 --> 01:37:51,524
My love

894
01:37:53,109 --> 01:37:54,610
was no lesser than your love.

895
01:37:54,694 --> 01:37:56,404
You made my life a disgrace.

896
01:37:56,487 --> 01:37:59,032
You made my life a disgrace.

897
01:37:59,115 --> 01:38:03,536
- I trusted you my whole life.
- How could I have told you?

898
01:38:04,579 --> 01:38:07,498
- How could I have told you?
- I married him.

899
01:38:07,582 --> 01:38:09,417
Don't you understand that?

900
01:38:43,576 --> 01:38:44,744
Here.

901
01:38:45,828 --> 01:38:48,789
Take these before you go.
I have no use for them.

902
01:39:03,388 --> 01:39:04,931
Not in front of him.

903
01:39:05,932 --> 01:39:07,267
- Oh.
- Oh, Luisa.

904
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:09,144
I'm so sorry,
I didn't know you had company.

905
01:39:09,227 --> 01:39:10,770
I'll come by later.

906
01:39:20,906 --> 01:39:21,906
Hi, Serjozha.

907
01:39:25,118 --> 01:39:27,453
Did Daddy come back with you?

908
01:39:29,956 --> 01:39:32,083
- No.
- But why?

909
01:39:32,959 --> 01:39:34,877
We already talked about this.

910
01:39:36,004 --> 01:39:38,631
Daddy's gone to live in heaven.

911
01:39:38,714 --> 01:39:40,175
But why?

912
01:39:41,717 --> 01:39:42,885
Because...

913
01:39:47,390 --> 01:39:49,100
Because he had to.

914
01:39:49,184 --> 01:39:52,979
- But when is Daddy coming back?
- Serjozha.

915
01:39:54,605 --> 01:39:56,107
Get me the shoes, please.

916
01:40:03,573 --> 01:40:05,366
Show me. What is this?

917
01:40:15,001 --> 01:40:16,836
Sergey

918
01:40:16,919 --> 01:40:20,840
I have to choose the only place
where I still feel free.

919
01:40:21,757 --> 01:40:23,051
The sky.

920
01:40:27,055 --> 01:40:29,140
Please

921
01:40:29,224 --> 01:40:30,433
don't wait for me.

922
01:40:31,726 --> 01:40:32,768
Forget me.

923
01:40:38,316 --> 01:40:41,361
I shall always think of you, Sergey.

924
01:40:41,444 --> 01:40:43,779
No matter what life may bring,

925
01:40:43,863 --> 01:40:47,617
I will always be there with you.
