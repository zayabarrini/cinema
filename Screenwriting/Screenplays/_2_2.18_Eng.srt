My mind will not achieve a lot.

Gary HOUSTON
Darya LESNlKOVA
Excuse me, where`s Studio 10?
Boris, it`s OK.
- Which one?
- Studio 10. Channel 6.
Go straight down the corridor to the elevators.
Then go up one floor.
Say hi to Vanya Demidov.
From whom?
- What`s your name, handsome?
- Danila.
- Who was that?
- Saltykova.
- l didn`t catch the name.
- Boris.
- Hers.
- lrina. lrina SALTYKOVA llya has looked for you downstairs
3 times already.
Where the hell have you been?
Guys, we go live in one minute.
Come on.
Did the soldiers from Chechnya arrive or not? lt`s OK, Vanya.
Kirill PlROGOV
Quiet on the set.
30 seconds to go.
- Did you host `Music Review` show?
- l used to.
So you are Kostya Gromov and you`ve got several medals of honor. you`re Danila Bagrov, and that makes you llya Setevoi.
Great. Take the sweater off.
Don`t interrupt me. We`re ready.
- Who`s lrina Saltykova?
- What? She`s a pop star!
Good evening. You`re watching
The World of People. ln 1996, in Chechnya,
Sergeant Kostya Gromov was decorated for bravery, but he didn`t know about it.
Now he has got his medal.
Here is Kostya Gromov and his comrades-in-arms
Danila Bagrov and llya Setevoi.
Dmitry Gromov, a famous Russian hockey player now in the NHL is Kostya`s twin brother.
- What were you honored for?
- lt was a covert operation...
Alexander DlACHENKO
When l came round, l saw the Big Guy...
- Who`s the Big Guy?
- lt`s Kostya.
So the Big Guy was dragging the two of us with his left hand.
And he had a machine gun and a Kalashnikov in his right hand
Blood was streaming out of me, my hip was busted. l could see the Kalashnikov bouncing around, bumping against Danila`s head. l thought he was lucky to have his helmet on.
Other guys didn`t make it.
Here`s a photograph.
- We`re at a rest point.
- lt`s summer already.
Which one of you is the toughest?
Danila.
He was very smart and never feared anything.
Hi. Turn on Channel 6.
Check out the boy with the full lips. l`ll call you back later.
Ray TOLER
Now l am a security guard in a bank.
A major one. lt`s the Nikolaevsky Bank. l like it there.
The guys are all athletes. l`m actually from Kiev.
After school l went to my Dad in Tula and soon l was recruited
And llya here works on the Red Square. lt`s the former Lenin Museum. l catalogue their archives.
They still have index cards. l also work as a night guard there.
That`s how l bumped into Danila. l went out one morning and he was standing there, looking at the Mausoleum.
What do you want to be?
Well, l want to enter an institute.
- Which one?
- A medical school. l want to heal people.
Really? That`s symbolic...
Look!
Your brother`s in Moscow.
They show him on TV.
And you sit here drinking vodka, you pig.
You` d better help your mother. l`m going to die soon.
You`ll be fine, Ma.
You should go to your brother in Moscow.
He`d help you out , you fool.
He`s your brother, after all.
Screw him...
BROTHER - 2
This message is for subscriber 712515. lrina, please call me on
7641232. lt`s Danila. You showed me the way to Channel 6.
Regards from Demidov. l`ll be waiting.
- Who`s that?
- Saltykova.
- Where did you get the number?
- From Demidov.
Warrant officer, get us some more cold beer.
Mitya was with the Kiev Falcons for 2 years.
Then he was drafted by the NHL to play for the Chicago Black Hawks. Cool!
Can you imagine? Your brother`s going to America to play hockey!
But the Kiev mob got him.
They egged Chicago Ukrainians on Mitya.
They said: ``We raised you, we gave you money, now it`s payback time.``
Greedy bastards!
Mitya knows if you pay once, you pay forever.
So he found some local protection... an American.
Katya, we are talking, OK?
The American got it right.
He found some people to represent Mitya`s interests in the NHL.
Lots of agents came with contracts to sign.
Mitya signed them all and the Ukrainians left him alone.
Everything was OK.
He was scoring his goals.
Not long ago the Pittsburgh
Penguins bought him.
But all the money goes to the account of this American.
And Mitya gets peanuts.
Mitya waited and waited until he realized he`s been conned.
He goes back to the Ukrainians but it`s too late.
This American is sort of a new Al Capone.
He even talks to Mitya through his lawyer.
And Mitya is a star!
- How much does he owe Mitya?
- 900 grand, US dollars.
What about filing a lawsuit?
He signed a contract! Mitya didn`t speak English that time.
He thought the Americans are honest unlike our lot.
- Guys we want some beer.
- Later.
This American has come to Moscow.
Mitya called me last night.
So what shall we do? l`ll talk to my boss. He`s meeting the American tomorrow.
Can you talk to the
American yourself? You speak English...
They wouldn`t let me.
He`s a new Al Capone.
What if he never gives it back? l don`t know... l can`t let my brother down!
We`re twins, we have always been together... lt`s been a year since l saw him and l miss him so much.
And who is this Al Capone?
Come on. He was the biggest gangster in America! lt`s for you.
Oh, hi!
Girls! l just wanted to see you.
Demidov gave me your number.
No, he`s not here.
Kotelnicheskaya?
Yes, l know.
See you.
- Where`s Kotelnicheskaya?
- You said you knew.
Reveille! Like they say in the army.
Like they said.
Hey, entrant, time to get ready for your exams.
Can l make a phone call?
The boss has arrived.
Hi, Mr. Belkin, l`m Kostya,
Gromov`s son, from Tula.
Yes, l remember. What is it?
Two years ago you helped my brother.
Now he plays hockey in America.
You asked your partner
Mr. Mennis from Chicago, to look after Mitya.
But he conned him and took all his money...
Would you, please talk to him? lf he does not listen to you, l`ll do it myself.
- What will you do?
- l`ll speak to him.
- To whom?
- To Mr. Mennis. He`s in Moscow.
OK, Kostya, l`ll talk to him. lrina, do you always watch yourself on TV?
- Dontcha like it?
- Why, it`s okay.
But l like bands like Nautilus or DDT.
What are you doing here then?
Get out. l am pressed for time.
Come on, don`t get mad with me.
They don`t listen to this kind of music there. lt`s fake.
- Where?
- ln the war.
What war? There`s no war here.
And the rules are different.
This is my kind of music l really like you. And the music`s got nothing to do with it.
Boris, have you got a payphone token coin?
Kostya? How did it go?
We`ll party in the Metropol.
My boss promised to talk to him.
Pick me up at 6.
Over and out!
How is it going, officer on duty?
You haven`t been with us for a long time, Valentin.
Progress, Richard.
Fax, e-mail, lnternet.
But you came to Moscow to appreciate the beauty of our capital.
Kate, get us some mint tea please. l came, Valentin, because your offer is very serious.
You`re right. A federal law was passed allowing gambling in lndian reservations. lt`s illegal for foreign companies to buy land there.
That`s why l addressed to you. l know you talent for evading the law.
- Mr.Belkin, the tea`s ready.
- Bring it, please.
We are talking about large sums of money.
Sums l know you don`t have.
That`s true.
But l have very serious partners whose names l can`t tell even you.
The main thing is that everything will go through me.
Now l would like to know your ideas on technicalities.
He`s busy at the moment, l`ll tell him. Good bye. lt`s very good.
Two years ago l asked you to help a Russian hockey player in Chicago?
He had some difficulties with the Ukrainian Mafia. lf you asked, Valentin, everything is all right.
We are getting involved in a big operation.
You are interested in diamonds l am interested in the NHL. lt should not concern our new agreement.
We should be looking out for each other. l`ll pick you up at the ``Metropol`` hotel at 6.
Take Mr.Mennis to the hotel.
Get me Chief of security!
Quickly!
Still asleep? lt`s already
5 o`clock!
You pick up Kostya, l`ll come at 7.
- OK?
- OK. Over and out.
Brake with your legs, not with your head, shitass.
There are too many freaks. They buy cars and driving licenses but they can`t actually drive.
Where are you going?
You asshole!
You should be driving a road-roller.
Where do they get their money?
They probably buy it as well!
A country of sheep and goats!
You vote for a thin guy, and in a year you`re watching some arse-faced hog on TV who tells you how to live.
- Where?
- Turn right behind that building.
That`s the Taganka Theater!
Behind that building indeed.
There were fewer halfwits in my generation.
Can`t you tell red from green, you cow?
Green means `go`, red means `stop`!
They used to be sensible people and suddenly they all turned into cretins. Paradox.
Sound the horn.
That`s not a boat...
That`ll be 66 rubles.
- Wait a minute, l`ll get my friend.
- Even women never wait for such morons.
Police. lt`s a murder. 7 Khokhlovsky Lane, apartment 4. lt`s Konstantin Gromov.
Found by Danila Bagrov.
Waiting. llya, Kostya`s been killed.
Don`t call on his cellular phone.
Wait at the museum.
Chief, put the beds down.
Gimme a cigarette.
Hey, blockhead, gimme a light.
You deaf, shithead?
You hear what the guv said?
So, you were planning to enter an institute.
You came to check out the access courses.
And you didn`t know about the registration? Right?
Can`t you read it? l can hold you for another three days.
Do you really want it?
- Why did you beat them up?
- They asked for it. l want my Discman back.
Nikolaevsky Bank. Founders:
Belkin Valentin Edgarovich.
Child: Belkin Fedya.
Studies at Nikolaevsky School.
We need guns.
Hello, Fascist. lt`s llya.
We need trophies of war.
OK.
- Heil Hitler.
- Hi.
- Who`s he?
- One of our own.
A brother to your own, for better or for worse.` lt`s a popular fascist saying.
- l`m Fascist.
- Danila.
- Are you German?
- Russian.
- Actually my Granddad was killed in the war.
- lt happens.
What can l offer you, gentlemen?
Five MPs - four 40s, and a 38.
Everything is checked.
With full ammunition.
Here are anti-personnel fragmentation grenades.
They sometimes misfire. lt`s a 50-50 chance.
Panzerfausts with two rounds.
Sorry, not checked.
Here are the handguns: four Walthers, one Parabellum. lt`s imported stuff.
As for domestic products there`s a Degtyarev machine-gun. lt was hardly ever used.
Four PPS`s - they`re heavy, but reliable.
There`s one Tula Tokarev or TT.
They get snapped up very quickly.
There`s one Nagan but it`s not very reliable.
The firing pin`s worn down. l don`t suppose you`d be interested in Mosin rifles.
Where does all this come from? lt`s the echo of the war.
- Where are we going?
- To Moscow.
Hey, Dan, he`s still there.
Brother.
...then l went to the Nikolaevsky Bank and asked for Kostya Gromov.
Mum gave me the address.
Some jerk of a guard said:
``No one of this name works here``.
So, l thought if there`s nobody at the museum... l`ve got no money and the cops check my passport on every corner.
Lucky l`ve got my police pants on.
Wow! ls it real? lt belonged to Chapayev.
- Those were the days!
- Will you go to America with me?
Anywhere you say.
We need passports and visas, and a good car for a few hours.
Brother, will you help me?
Give me a light.
You ever get any sleep?
My boss is always on the move doing things.
He`s got a cool car. ls it German?
- Whom do you want to see?
- Fedya Belkin.
- He`s already arrived.
- l`m his brother. l`m late.
That`s OK, they haven`t started yet.
- You can leave it here.
- l`ve got a present there.
This concert is dedicated to the Students` Day.
Meet Fedya Belkin.
He will recite the Student`s poem! l discovered that l`ve got
Relatives, and they`re my lot.
They are woods that are so dear
Fields of corn and every ear,
Streams of water, skies of blue. l shall tell them: ``l love you``. lt`s the Homeland of mine l shall love it all the time!
Hi, Fedya!
The poem... You recited it very well... l`m your new Russian teacher,
Danila Sergeyevich...
Valentin Edgarovich. l`m Fedya`s Russian teacher. l need to talk to you.
Let`s go into the teachers` room.
You go to the conference hall.
- Who`s he?
- Our new Russian teacher.
Goodbye, America,
Where l have never been,
Farewell forever...
Keep your hands on the table.
That`s good.. l pull on the trigger, your balls fall down.
Frightened? Were you frightened when you killed Kostya?
Kostya?
Yes, Gromov. lt wasn`t me. lt was the American. lt was him. l couldn`t. l know his father. l promised Kostya. l didn`t think he`d refuse. He`s greedy.
Tell me everything about the American. Now!
Sorry, l`m talking with a sponsor.
A few more minutes
Still talking?
He`s a big shot in lllinois.
He financed the mayor`s election campaign.
He`s got congressmen in his pocket.
He deals in drugs, owns a string of blues and rock clubs in Chicago.
He launders his money in them.
His headquarters are in the Metro club.
He deals in land and real estate.
He does any business promising money, like NHL...
He orders films in Russia with real rapes and murders and sells them over there.
He`s very greedy.
He`ll kill you for 100 bucks.
And he conned Kostya`s brother. l...l didn`t do it.
A million is no big deal for him.
He`s got ...
Don`t shoot. You`re a reasonable man.
All right, live on, scum.
Thank your son. lt`d be a shame to leave such a nice kid without a father.
Sit quiet and let your pants dry out.
Don`t bother him. He`s writing an application for the school board.
You should see a doctor.
Prostatitis is a mean thing.
You won`t get a hard on and that`s all.
Give me a break!
Why did you kill him, you oaf?!
You told me yourself: he doesn`t mind his own business and you don`t want to see him around.
Shitass!
And llya, he works on the Red Square. lt`s the former Lenin Museum. l catalogue their archives. l also work as a night guard there.
- That`s how l bumped into Danila.
- To the museum, fast!
Got to get a new car.
There`s too much heat.
- l changed the plates.
- That thug at the school memorized them.
- l`ll change them again.
- When will passports be ready?
Tomorrow or the day after. lt`s not easy.
Yes... He`s dead.
Here`s the money. Nothing more left.
As soon as you get the passports buy two tickets to Chicago.
We need to scram.
Sooner or later they`ll check out the museum. And the apartments.
- They won`t find yours.
- The cops have got my address.
Let`s go.
Let`s take this one too. lt`s a beauty.
This message is for subscriber 712515. lrina, call me immediately.
Danila. l told you there`s too much heat.
Sit quiet, it`s OK.
Your driving license and car papers.
Hello.
She can`t speak right now.
They are shooting a new video.
- ls it a decade pass?
- Hang on...
Yes, it is. l`ll come over.
Where is it?
We`re going to the TV center.
- Have a safe trip.
- Goodbye.
Wow!
Relax. My papers... are in order.
Don`t worry, pops.
We`re friends of llya`s.
We`ll just take a look at the exhibition.
They left an hour ago.
Three of them. They took some kind of a box.
The old guy doesn`t remember a fucking thing.
Lay an ambush. Start looking for a white Volvo.
Call the traffic police.
They could change registration plates.
Check out the airlines:
The name is Bagrov, flying to Chicago.
Guys from Aeroflot will tell me, of course, but other airlines never give out such info.
Get a Duma deputy`s card or a security service lD.
Do l have to spell it out for you?
Okay.
Cut.
That was no good. 25 frames
& the whole track.
Once again!
- How long`s it been going on?
- For the third day, already.
- lt`s a hard job...
- But not the worst one.
- Where did you serve?
- ln the paratroopers.
- Did you see any action?
- l had a crack at the Afghans.
Listen, is there... anything going on between you and lrina? lt`s just... well, l really like her.
But she sings all that crap. lt`s no Nautilus or DDT.
Maybe you should become a music producer?
Maybe l will. But l`ve got no ear for it.
Another four hours. l thought we`d finish sooner,
Can l wait for you at home?
Boris, give him the key... or a lift. lt`s OK, l`ve got a car.
Shall l buy anything? l`ll call you when l wake up.
Hey, buddy, was that lrina Saltykova?
Does she live here?
Listen, buddy, whose banger is it?
No idea. l am a stranger here.
Have you seen this guy around here?
Nope.
Saltykova`s cool.
You screwing her?
There are some guys hanging out at the Volvo.
- Serious guys. They`ve got your photo.
- Cops?
- Don`t look like them.
- How many?
Two by the car.
Some more in the jeep. l can`t see. The windows are tainted.
One by the doorway.
- Thanks, Boris.
- Keep lrina out of it.
Tired? l`m not alone. My brother
Victor`s here.
He was like a father to me.
- Victor Bagrov.
- lrina.
Pleased to meet you. l don`t like Kirkorov,
He`s too sweet. All that make-up. Powdered, like a woman.
What would you say? A Romanian.
- But he`s Bulgarian.
- ls he? Any difference?
Where are you, llya?
The address is 2 Sadovaya
Triumphalnaya.
The passports are ready.
The flight`s tomorrow morning.
Move! There`s a jeep downstairs and four fighters.
You`ll run to the car and open a door for me.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
What are you doing here?
Hit the ground!
My regards to Belkin.
That`s the first misfire.
Where are we going? l`ll drive.
2 men. A tommy-gun and grenades.
Shiryay`s been hit. The plate number of Volvo is...
Get Semyon on the case.
Don`t let them slip away!
He came to the school with this Bald one.
Sava identified him.
He`s clean with the cops.
We`re checking his Mafia links.
A ticket for an Aeroflot flight to Chicago was booked and purchased.
The name is Bagrov. Departs on the 22nd.
What date is it today? ldiot!
Yes, Belkin speaking.
Hello, Valentin Edgarovich.
We`ve transferred the first installment of money to your account according to the new plan...
Your partner will receive it in time.
Good, Konstantin Alexeyevich. ls everything OK?
Yes, thank you.
We hear you`re having problems... l solve my problems myself.
- Goodbye.
- All the best.
We can`t lose them, brother.
We`ll make it.
Dan, turn off to some quiet place and brake when l tell you.
Fascist wasn`t kidding.
That`s for you.
Flight to Chicago departs at 9:10 a. m.
You fly to New York two hours later.
Don`t argue. lt`ll be better that way.
You buy a car for $500 on Brighton Beach and in 12 hours you`re in Chicago.
You return four days later.
Why so quick?
You meet here.
That`s Lake Michigan, the fourth bridge.
There`s a bench there. l hooked up Kostya`s cellular phone to the roaming system.
Take this. Use it if you have to.
Some 250-300 dollars are left on it. The pin-code is 3232.
Victor Bagrov, you`re going to the conference on new computer technologies and software protection.
Danila Bagrov, l don`t know the purpose of your visit yet. l`ll have to roam around lnternet a couple more hours. ls it the real thing?
Well...almost.
While passing passport control look confident and smile.
They like it. That`s about all.
- Well, see you there, brother.
- Freedom to Angela Davis! lt`s been a long time since l kissed in an entrance hall.
- Have you ever been to America?
- Yes.
- What`s it like?
- Nothing special. l`ve never been abroad.
You haven`t missed much.
Why did you bring me here?
- lt`s beautiful.
- Let`s go to my place.
My train leaves in an hour.
Call me, OK?
- Are you going to America?
- Of course not. To Tula.
You can dial without long-distance codes.
Just like in Moscow. lt`s a special phone.
With roaming. l know.
Okay. l won`t be long. Four days only.
He`s dead. Let`s go inside.
- Who`s dead?
- My friend.
He wasn`t there!
He couldn`t have slipped through!
Boss, we checked everything.
- Has Bagrov checked in?
- Yes.
- Did all passengers board the plane?
- Yes.
What are you taking me for?
Who is flying to Chicago?
Could l have another glass ofjuice?
Right, guys, this is
Danila Bagrov.
We have to meet him at the airport
& get rid of him. Nice and quiet.
Some good people asked us to help the Muscovites out.
Now we shall fill in entrance forms.
All the necessary information can be found in your entry visa.
- What is the purpose of your visit to the United States? - What?
- Do you speak English?
- No...l don`t understand.
He`s Russian.
What is the purpose of your visit to the USA? lt`s a...conference on new computer technologies and software protection.
How long will you stay in the USA?
Four days. lt`s written there.
Here`s the return ticket.
- Where will you be staying?
- ln a hotel. lt`s written in the invitation.
- Welcome to the United States.
- Thank you very much.
Morons...
- Have you got lard or apples?
- Why?
Do you have any food?
Apples? Pork lard?
Don`t they sell it here?
You don`t understand.
This is quarantine!
You feeling bad?
- Hey, how do l get downtown?
- By taxi.
Hey, fellow countryman, where do the Russians live here?
Russians aren`t my countrymen.
- You a Nazi collaborator?
- What?!
Okay, guys, see you around!
Mister Mennis, it`s Moscow on line 1 .
Valentin, how are things? l`d like to congratulate you.
Your partners are serious people. l received the first installment of money.
Everything goes according to our plan.
Tomorrow l`ll meet with some people.
And we`ll discuss all the technicalities.
Everything OK with you?
Yes, everything`s fine with me.
But you have got problems.
The Ukrainians say he wasn`t on the plane.
Just like l told you.
We checked the Bald one with the mob.
His nick is Tartar.
He`s a hit man.
Worked in St.Pete.
Last year he bumped off some kingpins and disappeared.
He was on that plane.
So they`ve hired a hit man and Bagrov stayed here.
Reinforce my bodyguards! Keep looking for Bagrov and that museum guy.
Check who he was staying with in that building where we found the Volvo and post a watch there.
Send the Ukrainians a picture of this Bald one, eh... Tartar.
They`ve got to find him.
What`s the purpose for your visit to the USA?
New York Film Festival
- Where?
- To Brighton Beach.
- How much?
- 45.
- 45 of what?
- Bucks.
- Can you cut the price?
- l can`t.
This one.
Hello.
- Brighton Beach.
- Stop yelling!
Oh, l thought you didn`t speak Russian.
Think less, use your brains.
You`re not in Russia anymore.
Those jerks are dying to have a look!
- What was it?
- One more jerk.
- Meaning me?
- Who else?
- Why the hell did you come here?
- To see how people live. l know your type. l`ve been driving for a long time.
First you live with your friends, then you rent an apartment, and wait where the bent-up
American dream would take you.
You`re wrong. l love my Homeland.
A patriot! The Russian ldea!
Dostoyevsky! The Homeland!
Where`s your homeland, son?
Gorbachov sold it out to the Americans to have some party.
Your homeland screwed up two wars and the Crimea.
Sold out Russians in the Baltics and the Serbs.
Your homeland is wherever your backside is warm!
You know it. That`s why you are here.
Have you got a brother in Moscow?
What are you gaping at, dopey?
Get a move on.
Meet my friend.
- Danila.
- Kuibyshev.
Oh, Moscow, Moscow...Russia.
Come along then, young fellows.
Don`t pay attention to the exterior. lt`s got an engine that goes like my Sonya!
- lt could take you to Kiev.
- Will it make it to Chicago?
Even to San Francisco and back!
We Russians don`t rip off one another.
Hi, where are you? l`ve got stuck near Tula.
My car`s broken down!
- How are you doing?
- Fine. Can you drop in today?
No, not today. Call again!
A new Russian. The name is Tartar.
What an ugly mug! They`ve got all kinds of people in Moscow. l saw him at the airport.
The dog called me a Nazi collaborator.
Post a round-the-clock watch at the Metropol where the Russians hang out.
Remember that hockey guy Gromov?
He came to us before.
They might meet up there.
- And what about this one?
- Throw it away.
Give me the bottle and let see some lD. l don`t understand a fucking word.
You`re breaking the lllinois state law.
You can`t drink alcohol in public. Your lD, please.
Bullshit. Everyone`s doing it.
Over there by the shop.
Their bottles are in paper bags. l don`t see them drinking.
But you are drinking in public.
Your passport or license please.
What is the difference?
You are under arrest.
- Give me my passport.
- You are under arrest.
- Accompany me to the police car.
- Fuck you.
- l`m a policeman.
- So am l.
- 1019. Officer is attacked.
- Quiet.

- Chicago?
Get in.
Where are you from? l am an American. l live in America.
Where are you from?

From Moscow?
Russia is very big.
-What`s your name?

Are you insane?
Wait, l`ve got to buy a gun.

Do you know this poem? l discovered that l`ve got
Relatives, and they`re my lot.
Fuck you, snowflake.
They are woods that are so dear
Fields of corn and every ear l`ll cut your ass.
Streams of water, skies of blue l will tell them: ``l love you``.
You white shithead! l`ll blow your head off! lt`s the Homeland of mine. l will love it all the time.
Marilyn. Come here, you bitch! ls there a back way out of here?
Hi! What are you doing? l`m running!
Mr.Belkin, we`ve transferred the money.
We`re up and running, as they say.
Your reputation and your word speak for themselves.
But you`ve got problems.
Like l said, l sort it out -
You don`t take chances with this kind of money.
What does `how are you` mean? lt means `how are you`.
- Do they really mean it?
- No, they do not.
- Then why do they ask?
- They just ask.
But they are dead serious when it comes to money. l`m hungry.
Look, crawfish climb out right onto the pier and no one bothers to catch them.
- Maybe he isn`t coming?
- He`ll come.
Brother...
Eight years is a long time. l wasn`t even twenty then.
University, Perestroika,
America, Coca-Cola.
Got married, then got divorced. l worked for an escort service in New York. l was a call girl.
Then coke, crack. l went to Chicago with one fattie. He dumped me.
Then l got mixed up with that black jerk.
Oh, one shouldn`t speak ill of the dead.
Anyway, it`s all boring and dull.
You know it was 1984 when l last sat at the campfire.
We went camping at
Glukhoe Lake...
Come home with us. lt`s OK there.
- And what will l do there?
- What are you doing here? l like it here. America is the world`s driving power!
- What is its power, brother?
- lt`s the money, brother.
Money rules the world. Whoever has the most is the strongest.
Suppose, you`ve got a lot of money.
What would you do?
- l`d buy everyone.
- Even me?
What does he want?
Some crawfish?
What do you want?
Dirt. He says the food`s dirty.
Crawfish eat the dirt.
We shouldn`t eat them.
What? Dirt?
Look at you Black scum.
You need a good scrub! Get lost!
Leave him. Negro, go, go!
Who are you calling Negro? l`ll show you a real Negro.
- You shouldn`t call him a Negro.
- And who is he?
- He`s an Afro-American.
- What`s the difference?
Nigger sounds offensive to them.
That`s what l was taught at school. The Chinese live in China, the Germans live in Germany, the Jews in lsrael & Negroes in Africa. l think the power`s in them.
There`s something primordial
& brutal about these people. We lost it, that`s why they`re stronger.
The whites know it and they`re afraid of them.
- We`d better go.
- Bastards, they spoiled the party.
What are you doing here?
- A toilet.
Back there.
Richard.
Remember l asked you about a Russian hockey player in Chicago?
Be on the look out!
A Russian professional came to get you. l`ll send a photograph of him to you over lnternet.
He`s already in Chicago.
We have to look after each other.
- Can l help you, sir?
- Mr. Mennis`s office.
Your name, sir?
Can l talk to Mr. Mennis?
No, thank you.
He`s at the Metro Club
He`ll be back late at night.
Don`t bother waiting.
He`s cheated on you.
Something could happen to him. l think he`s just a jerk.
He`s my brother!
OK, let`s go see Mennis.
Don`t shoot.
Where`s Mennis?
Money.
Where`s Mennis? ln Mennis`s office. lt`s all in cash there. l discovered that l`ve got
Relatives and they`re my lot.
They are woods that are so dear
Fields of corn and every ear.
Streams of water, skies of blue. l shall tell them: ``l love you!`` lt`s the Homeland of mine.
...and they`re my lot.
They are woods that are so dear
Fields of corn and every ear.
Streams of water, skies of blue. l shall tell them: ``l love you!`` lt`s the Homeland of mine. l will love it all the time. l discovered that l`ve got
Relatives and they`re my lot.
They are woods that are so dear
Fields of corn and every ear.
- How are you?
- Thank you. l`m OK.
That`s great.
Ah, Russian vodka! Good.
Come on.
American, what`s your power? ls it really money?
My brother says it`s money.
You`ve got lots of money - so what?
Truth is a real power.
Whoever is right is strong.
You cheated on a man and took away his money.
Did it make you stronger?
No, it did not.
Cos you are not right.
And the person you cheated on is.
That means he`s stronger.
Right?
Right.
Dmitry Gromov, gimme his money.
So, play hockey.
Will my money keep on going to Mennis` account?
Tell them to make transfers to your account.
- What about the contract?
- Forget it.
He did not pay me the interest on this money.
You are like your brother...
Give up, Russian!
Russians never give up!
- Hey, what`s happening here?
- Russian Mafia.
What`s going on here?
A Russian shot down
Ukrainian Mafiosi last night at the Lvov restaurant. l bet they`ll use tear gas next.
- How do you know?
- Don`t you watch the movies? l`m staying! l`m staying here! l`m gonna live here.
Hello. How are you? l`m Marilyn.
- Nice to meet you.
- lt`s nice to meet you.
How can l ask for help?
``l need help``.
Ben, lt`s Danila.
Ben. l need help.
Are you gangsters?
No, we are Russians.
Dasha, come over here.
