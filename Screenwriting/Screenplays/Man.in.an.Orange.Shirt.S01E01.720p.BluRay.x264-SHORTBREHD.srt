1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,422
I didn't know you owned a cottage.

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,340
Why did you two never live there?

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,184
I visited once,
but I never cared for it.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,182
Anyway, it was your grandfather's.

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,194
It was really all very basic.

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,951
Goodnight.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,185
Goodnight, dear.

8
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,429
My dear Flora, your photograph

9
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,839
is getting pretty battered with

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,824
all the travelling around
in my breast pocket.

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,434
I can't tell you where we are

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,796
or much of what we're doing, of course.

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,276
Much of the countryside is so beautiful

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,828
that I have to remind the men that

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,912
we're not here on holiday.

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,061
But then, merry hell breaks out again.

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,196
I'll spare you the details.

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,080
Aim at the olive groves,

19
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,554
until the others get
through to relieve us.

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
Yes sir!

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,907
Bastards got the supply lorry

22
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,149
before it could get through the gates, sir!

23
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,108
It's the driver, sir - another dead one
and they shot out the tyres.

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,754
Everybody out with the others, quickly!

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,916
We need the MO!

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,948
I think this one's still with us, sir!
- The MO's dead.

27
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,076
Put him with the rest.

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Quickly!

29
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,880
Not another!

30
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:10,155
He was in the back with the supplies!

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,389
Christ.

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,073
Set him down gently.

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,073
I need you back at the gatehouse.

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,674
We can't have the others
ambushed, do you understand?

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,600
Sir!

36
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,314
Don't just sit there, help him!

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,680
Sugar.

38
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,467
Our lives full of bloody sugar.

39
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,435
March.

40
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,274
Thomas March!

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,832
March, stay with me.

42
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,075
Stay with me!

43
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,080
March!

44
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,080
Captain.

45
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,630
You were lucky.

46
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,746
Your lot saved my life.

47
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
This...

48
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,672
This was your lifesaver.

49
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,712
I need to get your sketch pads

50
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,339
back from our CO;
he's not exactly artistic.

51
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,396
Berryman!

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,903
Was I a beast to you at school?

53
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,514
Berryman!

54
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,060
Actually you were always very kind.

55
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,434
What a relief.

56
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,518
Berryman, a word.

57
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,948
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,426
- Almost! Left, left! Oi!
- Watch it, watch it!

59
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,432
Come on, come on, get stuck in!

60
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,547
♪ I've got the joy, joy,
joy, joy down in my heart

61
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,666
Who are you writing to?

62
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,986
Oh, a girl back home, Flora.

63
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,468
She's a teacher.

64
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,274
Oh.

65
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,350
I've known her all my life.

66
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,342
She's almost like a sister.

67
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,589
Not entirely.

68
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,862
She lost her parents in an air raid.

69
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,279
Just like me.

70
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,104
Almost there...
Goal!

71
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,435
Goal!

72
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,434
Listen up, men.

73
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,113
This is Captain March.

74
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,827
He's an official war artist.

75
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,547
Now you're not to mind him drawing you.

76
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,074
His work is good for morale.

77
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,150
Sir.

78
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,028
Sir, is it true that the Hun lay
on tarts for their soldiers?

79
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,625
Yeah, how come they get
tarts and we get artists?

80
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,598
It's the morale back
home that art can raise.

81
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,946
It's for your wives and
girlfriends, your children.

82
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,280
Don't let them cheek you..

83
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
Sir?

84
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Go on, sir.

85
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,880
Paint me.

86
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,155
Put it away, Bates.

87
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,867
But he's raising my morale, sir.

88
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,278
Bates will drive you to rendezvous point

89
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,465
and then you'll be driven
back down to work from there.

90
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,834
How far to the Handover?

91
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,240
An hour at least.

92
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,670
Depending on the state of the road.

93
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,026
Well in that case, nature calls.

94
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,476
Are we likely to come under fire?

95
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,960
Hopefully not.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,504
Save fuel, men.
As you were, please.

97
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,862
The area should have been cleared.

98
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,272
It's bloody embarrassing, but I can't...

99
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,750
button my fly single handed.

100
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,352
Promise me that you'll come and find me?

101
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,040
I mean it.

102
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,630
Captain.

103
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,040
Captain Berryman!

104
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,236
You ought to be off, sir.

105
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,824
Rendezvous time's not that long away.

106
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,856
Of course Bates, good man.

107
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,633
Thank you, Bates.

108
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,718
Good luck.

109
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:17,469
What's so amusing, Travis?

110
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,552
Patroclus, miss.

111
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,828
Patroclus and Achilles,
I don't understand.

112
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,991
Your closest friend
is butchered in a battle

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,116
in which he wore your armour

114
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,827
because you disdained to fight.

115
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,274
You lament.

116
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,908
Perfectly understandable.

117
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,196
But they're not just friends are they?

118
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,427
Greek for friendship? Wickham?

119
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,510
Agape, miss.

120
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,868
Love between heroes was regarded

121
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,430
as surpassing the love between marriage,

122
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,175
but, in Sparta's...

123
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,956
Class rise.

124
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,184
Miss Talbot, boys.

125
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,953
We have just heard that Mr Churchill

126
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,828
has accepted Germany's surrender.

127
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,424
The war in Europe is at an end.

128
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,233
You may cheer, boys.

129
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,234
No more bloody war!

130
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,355
Hello.

131
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,467
Are you lost?

132
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,621
I was looking for Captain March.

133
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,074
Perhaps I have his address wrong.

134
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,106
No, no, he has the studio upstairs.

135
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,038
We share an entrance.

136
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
Oh.

137
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,267
I don't bite, unless you pay extra.

138
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,780
I'm Lucian: landlord, watchdog,

139
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,463
purveyor of shade to the gentry.

140
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,799
Who are you?

141
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,112
My name is Berryman, Michael Berryman.

142
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,831
Enter, Michael Berryman.

143
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,310
You came.

144
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,023
We were only demobbed
from Colchester this morning.

145
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,836
If it's not convenient...

146
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,275
Don't be silly. Its...

147
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Er...

148
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,232
So what are your plans?

149
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,312
For the rest of the evening?

150
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,910
Bugger all.

151
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Good.

152
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,350
What about...

153
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,787
Sorry, I've forgotten her name.

154
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Flora.

155
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,715
Flora Talbot.

156
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,944
She doesn't know I'm back yet.

157
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Left here.

158
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,035
Left!

159
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,459
I haven't been here
since my parents died.

160
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,353
I should've written.

161
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,430
I'm a coward.

162
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,194
I wrote to you in my head
every bloody day but I...

163
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,600
I wrote to you.

164
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Really?

165
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,992
Nothing ever got through.

166
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,830
I never said I posted them.

167
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
Tea!

168
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,030
Very old tea.

169
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,150
Fuck, the floor is cold.

170
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
I also found...

171
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,983
an unopened tin of shortbread.

172
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,912
It must be pre-war.

173
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,112
Good morning March.

174
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
Captain.

175
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,354
Thank you so much.

176
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,584
You haven't mentioned her all week.

177
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,193
It's scarcely appropriate.

178
00:16:58,194 --> 00:16:59,787
Do you love her?

179
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,354
I...

180
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,352
You'll love her too.

181
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,236
How cosy.

182
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,515
Please, Thomas.

183
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,068
I don't understand how you can be

184
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,560
so matter of fact.

185
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,320
Does she love you?

186
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,874
I imagine so or she wouldn't have

187
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,474
agreed to marry me.

188
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,912
Please say yes, Thomas.

189
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,798
Say you'll be there at least please.

190
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,758
I have no family.

191
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,072
I don't want to be your bloody family.

192
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
I...

193
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
Please.

194
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,190
You have no idea have you?

195
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,713
What about, Thomas?

196
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,280
You surely didn't think that we could

197
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:10,465
set up house together like man and wife.

198
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
Please.

199
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,670
Just be quiet.

200
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,350
Let's just go back to London.

201
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,832
Nearly there.

202
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,822
I'm so glad you wore Mummy's brooch.

203
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,434
Bloody hell.

204
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,147
You are not to cry.

205
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,760
Oh, there he is.

206
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:50,761
Thomas!

207
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,674
Hello.

208
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,520
You must be...

209
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:01,035
Daphne, older sister.

210
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,668
Matron of honour and all that.

211
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,433
Thomas March, how do you do?

212
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,069
Michael says you're an
artist. How very romantic.

213
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,434
Hardly.

214
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,954
Flora, how do you do?

215
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,880
Hello, Thomas.

216
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:12,587
You look wonderful.

217
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,520
Worth the wait.

218
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:14,749
Thank you.

219
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,548
Sorry that I couldn't
come to your supper party.

220
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,588
I'm horribly unsociable
when I'm working.

221
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,432
Talking of which.

222
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,944
I brought you something,
a wedding present.

223
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,589
That's so sweet.

224
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,400
We should probably...

225
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:29,239
Yes.

226
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Michael.
- Yes.

227
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,429
You came.

228
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,914
Of course I came.

229
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,916
Fucking best man has to.

230
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,063
If any man or woman knows just cause

231
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,904
or impediment why these two
should not be joined together

232
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,630
let him now speak or else hereafter

233
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,825
forever hold his peace.

234
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,638
Do you, Michael Sadler Berryman,

235
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,076
take Flora Agnes Talbot to be

236
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,434
your wedded wife?

237
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,034
I do.

238
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,743
It seems wrong
having no one in tears.

239
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,554
I don't think we...

240
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,996
Compliments of Mr March, sir.

241
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,834
Thomas, you shouldn't have.

242
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,390
You can't get married
and not have bubbles.

243
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Thank you.

244
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,553
Thank you.

245
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,039
So,

246
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,668
the bride and groom.

247
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,908
Bless you, Thomas.

248
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,585
Please, no speeches
anyone, or I shall cry.

249
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,747
You're really not having a honeymoon?

250
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,194
We haven't a bean until Michael's

251
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,634
salary from the bank comes through.

252
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,040
We used pretty much all of our savings

253
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,838
on a deposit for the flat.

254
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,152
So not even a weekend in your cottage?

255
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
Oh...

256
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,999
Oh, dear.

257
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,141
Not until it has a boiler, a new bathroom,

258
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,310
and no mice.

259
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,423
The flat is darling
though, right on the park.

260
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,556
You must come for supper.

261
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,994
Yes, you must.

262
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,707
Apparently, Thomas's pad in Soho

263
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,304
was unreconstructed Hogarth.

264
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,754
How marvellous.

265
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,989
Not really.

266
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,436
So, won't you miss your teaching?

267
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,280
Hardly.

268
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:36,195
All those dirty-minded little boys.

269
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,199
Ahh, food.

270
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,395
Daphne could eat a horse.

271
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,068
Naughty.

272
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,899
Thanks so much Thomas, for everything.

273
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,070
You, er...

274
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,152
You've been brilliant.

275
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,480
Haven't I?

276
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,030
Thomas I...

277
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
Thomas I, er...

278
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,720
I really...

279
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,155
What?

280
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,232
What, what do you really?

281
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
I just...

282
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,392
Just give us a bloody minute will you?!

283
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Of course.

284
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,540
You don't have to go through with this.

285
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,830
Of course I do.

286
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,822
If you have either sense or decency,

287
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,388
you'll do the same.

288
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,596
Well, I'll go and settle up.

289
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,273
You're perfection.

290
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,592
I feel a bit of a fraud.

291
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,716
Oh, darling.

292
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,752
You'll be fine.

293
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
You'll see.

294
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,078
I bet he's a real goer.

295
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,436
But sensitive with it.

296
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
It's...

297
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,160
What?

298
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Tell me.

299
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,954
It's a lot nicer if
he lets you ride up top.

300
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,234
I'm told it gets better.

301
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Yes.

302
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,600
I heard that too.

303
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,034
Mrs Berryman.

304
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,988
Actually, do you mind just...

305
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,832
Oh, of course, sorry.

306
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,749
Now if I snore,

307
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,310
you're to throw a book at me.

308
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,275
Goodnight.

309
00:25:36,276 --> 00:25:37,280
Goodnight.

310
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,598
Back to work, Berryman.

311
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,073
So who else should we invite?

312
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,186
If we simply have Daphne and
this new chap of hers.

313
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,716
Poor man will feel he's being auditioned.

314
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,915
Well isn't he?

315
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,151
She rather implied she'd
already auditioned him

316
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,914
and he'd passed with flying colours.

317
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,950
Sorry, what was that?

318
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,508
I was miles away.

319
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,752
I said who else should we invite?

320
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,752
Well I ran into Richard Tremayne

321
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,830
at Blackfriars the other day.

322
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,990
You know, from the regiment.

323
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,116
We could have him and his wife.

324
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,668
What about poor Thomas?

325
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,039
We haven't seen him since the wedding.

326
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,399
Daphne thought he was a bit of all right

327
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,270
and he has all sorts of eager
spinsters lined up for him.

328
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,192
No, I don't think so.

329
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,748
Why ever not?

330
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,911
Well he's not terribly sociable really.

331
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,149
He'd only be a dead weight.

332
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,700
And you can tell Daphne
he's a confirmed bachelor.

333
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,624
She'd only take that
as a personal challenge.

334
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,000
Daphne.

335
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:54,151
Thank God, I'm starving.

336
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,040
Me too.

337
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,669
Oh, of course you are!

338
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,787
My darling, how many weeks to go?

339
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,075
Two or three.

340
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,119
Ooh.

341
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,988
Let's find you a nice bench.

342
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,834
Such a drama this morning.

343
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,547
Phil Gladstone.

344
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,518
Which is he?

345
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,796
Victorian watercolours and china.

346
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,507
Lives with his mother.

347
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,661
He was arrested
first thing this morning.

348
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,308
No, why?

349
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,312
It turns out he was also living

350
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,676
with the man upstairs.

351
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,911
One of their neighbours had sneaked

352
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,354
and the police showed up at dawn

353
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,274
and caught them together, in bed.

354
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,511
Will he go to prison?

355
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,919
Almost certainly.

356
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,664
And Bill has a prior
history of gross indecency.

357
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,000
Which isn't as bad as buggery

358
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:42,470
but it's almost as bad.

359
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,464
No more handling Lady
Downing's bristols for him.

360
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,662
Gross indecency; you mean...
exposing himself?

361
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,478
No, you know.

362
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,187
Public lavatories.

363
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Oh.

364
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:13,414
Now darling, tell. You sounded
all shaky when you rang.

365
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,113
I was quite worried.

366
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,914
It was nothing.

367
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,514
Hormones running riot, probably.

368
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,354
Making me feel like a caged beast.

369
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,113
It is good to see you.

370
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,784
You know you can tell me.

371
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,758
You can tell me anything.

372
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
I know.

373
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,592
But, it's nothing.

374
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,114
Everything's fine.

375
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,268
Well, this is nice.

376
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,119
I'm sorry.

377
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,192
Darling, I was miles away.

378
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,589
And you've gone to so much trouble

379
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,353
and in your condition.

380
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,908
Time on my hands.

381
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,943
I tidied your desk this morning.

382
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,714
Why?

383
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,988
I needed some ink and it
was full of junk in there.

384
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,506
Hope I didn't throw out anything precious.

385
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,620
Well, I'm a hoarder.
You'll reform me yet.

386
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,790
Where's Thomas's painting?

387
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,754
I took it down, I rather hate it.

388
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,670
Well perhaps I could take it to

389
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,518
the cottage so you...

390
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,708
Your precious cottage,
you'd love that wouldn't you?

391
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,583
Pudding's only pears, I'm afraid.

392
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,794
Oh, God.

393
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,431
Take this fucking thing.

394
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,120
What should I...

395
00:32:12,121 --> 00:32:13,349
I don't want it under
our roof another night,

396
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,510
it's repellent.

397
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:14,998
Yes.

398
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,514
I mean, what are you?

399
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,839
Are you safe around children?

400
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,752
What were you thinking marrying me?!

401
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,672
Do you even love me?!

402
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,990
If I'm expected to lie
around bringing forth

403
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,665
like some brood mare,
while the two of you...

404
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,998
Ah..!

405
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,354
Darling, darling, sit down.

406
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,760
Don't touch me!

407
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,830
Never touch me!

408
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,194
You're disgusting!

409
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
Criminal!

410
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
Mr Berryman.

411
00:32:51,961 --> 00:32:53,987
Oh, thank God.

412
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,434
It's this way.

413
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,669
You came just in time.

414
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,467
Go and have a drink, Mr Berryman.

415
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,711
It'll be hours yet.

416
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,260
And it's all woman's
work from here on in.

417
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,598
Ooh..! So sorry.

418
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,320
Let me put those in water.

419
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:49,321
Thank you.

420
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,673
There's not much on
offer this time of year,

421
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,000
even in Covent Garden.

422
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,552
You went all that way?

423
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,954
They're lovely, I like white roses.

424
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,238
He's sweet.

425
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,993
A bit soon to tell.

426
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,743
Eager feeder, though...
but it hurts like hell.

427
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,666
I thought maybe Robert,
after your father.

428
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,274
And James for mine.

429
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,279
Darling, I'm so...

430
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,786
I am far, far too tired to talk about it.

431
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,436
Would you like to hold him?

432
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,393
He's asleep.

433
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,834
Perhaps we should just leave him.

434
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,274
No, pick him up, please.

435
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,536
I want the father of my child
- I really...

436
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,996
to hold his son.

437
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,835
Hold his head.

438
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,795
So you like it?

439
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
What?

440
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,080
The name.

441
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,910
Robert James.

442
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,832
Yes, yes, it's perfect, perfect.

443
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,638
Did you light a cigar?

444
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,074
Certainly not.

445
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,914
It took me several
weeks to track you down.

446
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,514
How?

447
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,980
Your boss and I go back a long long way.

448
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,519
But he's...

449
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,432
He's married with children.

450
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,625
There's a lot of it about.

451
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,793
Thomas is in prison.

452
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,440
Why?

453
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,634
The usual.

454
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,640
Cottaging.

455
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,580
Oh Christ, he really can pick 'em.

456
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,353
Gross indecency, dear.

457
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,839
One year.

458
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,434
You must visit him.

459
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,598
But...

460
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,353
No buts - he needs you.

461
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,590
What lies you tell are up to you.

462
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,946
Though I'm told dentistry usually works.

463
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Why me?

464
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,790
Because you could fuck, understand him,

465
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,428
and meet the mother.

466
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,632
You got under his skin.

467
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,990
He loves you.

468
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,720
Truly.

469
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,914
Right, let's be havin' yer.

470
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,822
I brought your pad and some charcoal.

471
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,028
You look terrible, Thomas.

472
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,588
It's prison food.

473
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,160
Permanent trots.

474
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,910
You look like a bank manager.

475
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,560
How's...

476
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
Flora?

477
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,264
Yes, well, fine, fine.

478
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,657
Though motherhood seems to
make her a little impatient.

479
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
She...

480
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,102
Baby boy arrived in November; Robert.

481
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,280
Just make sure that she doesn't...

482
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,787
...that she doesn't turn him into
a banker, too.

483
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,716
I, um...

484
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,265
We'd uh...

485
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,544
We'd like to ask you to be his godfather.

486
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,274
Once you get out.

487
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,430
What on earth for?

488
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,981
Well, whatever you
think of church or children,

489
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,272
it's rather a good way to stay in touch

490
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,511
with the people who matter.

491
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,148
Don't visit again.

492
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,552
- But, er...
- It's upsetting.

493
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,920
Oh.

494
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,998
Do something for me.

495
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,626
I was at school with Thomas, Mrs March.

496
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,548
I know who you are, Mr Berryman.

497
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,680
How is he?

498
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
He, er...

499
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,516
He's, um, he's grown a beard.

500
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,520
Hmm.

501
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,540
His father did that once, for Ibsen.

502
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,314
Does it suit him?

503
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,273
Yes.

504
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,280
Yes...

505
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,911
He looks like a submariner.

506
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,379
It's oddly like having
him back in boarding school.

507
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,154
I was forbidden to visit there, too,

508
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,311
in case I embarrassed him.

509
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,424
Oh, you needn't look at
me with such sensitivity.

510
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,503
I'm well aware of what he
did and why he's there.

511
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,864
I've been storing them in his absence...

512
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,023
rather than leave them
with that creature in Soho.

513
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,906
I write him letters in soft pencil

514
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,878
on one side of cartridge paper

515
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,190
so he can draw on the other.

516
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,954
Well, you should take this one.

517
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,225
It's only a study.

518
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,859
He must've sold the finished portrait.

519
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,898
I call it Man In An Orange Shirt.

520
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,512
But it's you, isn't it?

521
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,840
Yes.

522
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,358
So, you must take it.

523
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,342
No, no, I couldn't possibly.

524
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,027
I think it's wonderful, the colours.

525
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,112
But, our... our flat is so tiny.

526
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,320
Perhaps, um...

527
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,105
perhaps just one of the notebooks.

528
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,104
Oh, well, that one's damaged.

529
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,120
Yes, but, er...

530
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,390
I was there, you see.

531
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,138
I have a very small house
in France, Mr Berryman.

532
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,988
In a very small village in Cassis.

533
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,706
You can go there when Thomas comes out.

534
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,032
He can paint and you, you can...

535
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,432
you can write something.

536
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,702
That's very kind of you, Mrs March,
but, erm...

537
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,436
he wants nothing more to do with me.

538
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,876
Oh, that's just pride.

539
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,384
And I have a wife and child.

540
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,509
Is she happy?

541
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,840
She's...

542
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,392
I should be getting home.

543
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,510
My darling Thomas, you refuse my visits so

544
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,388
you're probably tearing up my letters, too.

545
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,270
But there's nothing else
I can do but keep trying.

546
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,148
It's beyond my control, do you see?

547
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,946
All those months ago when I
had nothing to lose really,

548
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,110
I wrote to you in my head,

549
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,741
but was too cowardly to set
more than lies on paper.

550
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,389
And now I find I no longer care.

551
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,513
The love I feel for you

552
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,026
runs through me like grain through wood.

553
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,510
I love you Thomas, I love you.

554
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,186
Your face, your voice, your touch

555
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,158
enter my mind at the least
opportune moments

556
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,586
and I find I have no
power to withstand them.

557
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,670
No desire to.

558
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,584
I want us to be together
as we were in the cottage.

559
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,354
Only forever, not just a weekend.

560
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,678
I want it to go on so long

561
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,387
that it feels normal.

562
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,702
I want to do all the
ordinary unbedroomy things

563
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,951
we never got around to doing.

564
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,270
Making toast, raking leaves,

565
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,188
sitting in silence.

566
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,074
I love you, Thomas.

567
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,546
I've always loved you.

568
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,789
I see that now.

569
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,832
Tell me I'm not too late.

570
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,553
There she is.

571
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,916
Want to say hello.
- Oh, look.

572
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,554
So solemn.

573
00:47:50,555 --> 00:47:51,909
So like his pa.

574
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,272
I can't believe he's nearly one already.

575
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,192
I say, not to worry about bridge tonight

576
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,158
if Michael's away.

577
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,833
Patrick can always take
me out somewhere instead.

578
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,240
Oh, tonight?

579
00:48:04,241 --> 00:48:05,079
But he's...

580
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,080
I was coming out
of South Ken on my way

581
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:07,708
to Christie's this morning and I saw him

582
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,429
striding towards the
train with his suitcase

583
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,024
as well as the usual briefcase.

584
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,439
Oh, yes.

585
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,320
I'm such a dolt, darling.

586
00:48:15,321 --> 00:48:16,279
I completely forgot to tell you,

587
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,387
he's got some dreary conference to go to.

588
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,662
Banking, weather, you
know the sort of thing.

589
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,816
Well, we can play when he's back.

590
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,475
Are you all right?

591
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,468
Fine.

592
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,832
Oh, do hush, Robert.

593
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,910
Oh, hush!

594
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,874
For pity's sake!

595
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,629
Hello, can you put me through to
Michael Berryman, please?

596
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,360
Who's calling?

597
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:01,433
It's his wife.

598
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,184
Oh, of course, his wretched teeth.

599
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,954
How stupid of me to have forgotten.

600
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,600
Oh, stop it!

601
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,598
I can't bear it!

602
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,706
Stop it!

603
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,916
Stop it!

604
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,040
Sorry.

605
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,663
I'm so sorry.

606
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,400
Thomas..!

607
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,944
Thomas, boy!

608
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,120
How are you?

609
00:50:07,121 --> 00:50:08,271
Thomas! Oh.

610
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,236
The key's in the cab, come on.

611
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,360
Hello.

612
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,200
Hello.

613
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,998
I'll tell you anything you'd...

614
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,992
I'd rather you didn't.

615
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,795
I don't want a divorce.

616
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,234
Please, Michael.

617
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,632
It wouldn't be fair to Robert.

618
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,781
But I don't want to make you wretched.

619
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,112
I never want details.

620
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,824
You must never get caught.

621
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,593
We will never speak of it.

622
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,520
Darling I...

623
00:52:58,521 --> 00:53:01,435
Please, don't you love me at all?

624
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,320
Of course I do.

625
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,113
I'm just the sister

626
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,983
who happened to bear your child.

627
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,998
I can live with that.

628
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,558
Lovely morning, sir.

629
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,473
Is all well?

630
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,064
He wants to make an entrance.

631
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,400
Ready?

632
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,834
We can't wait.

633
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,550
Stop laughing at me!

634
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,472
Oh dear.

635
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,984
Fortnum's will cheer him up.

636
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,114
I just need to find the gents.

637
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,954
We'll meet you down by the lifts.

638
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,120
Robert, can I help?

639
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,269
Sorry, sorry.

640
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,954
Who's joining me on a bus to Fortnum's?

641
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,798
Me!

642
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,916
May I come too?

643
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,548
Don't be silly.

644
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,996
Michael, Flora.

645
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,560
Thomas.

646
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,988
How are you?

647
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,753
Fine, fine.

648
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,830
Stunning day.

649
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,633
We've just been kitting
someone out for boarding school.

650
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,438
So I'm bracing myself for a long afternoon

651
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,919
sewing in name tapes.

652
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,673
He can't be that age already.

653
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,389
We haven't met Robert, I'm Thomas March.

654
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,675
I knew your father when he wasn't

655
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,672
much older than you are.

656
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,992
Yes, yes, before I became respectable.

657
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,278
So Thomas, you've been too long a stranger

658
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,350
we must have you over.

659
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,908
Yes, we must.

660
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,708
I've not longed moved, to Cassis.

661
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,389
To your mother's place?

662
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,028
Yes, that's right.

663
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,182
I'm just over for my new exhibition.

664
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,192
It opens tonight.

665
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,200
Oh, bother.

666
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,909
Well, you could go along, darling.

667
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,074
Well, no, it's Robert's
last night of freedom.

668
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,994
I can't let you start
school without a present, hmm?

669
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,070
Here.

670
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,116
Thomas, you shouldn't...

671
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,120
What do you say, Robert?

672
00:56:38,121 --> 00:56:39,441
Thank you, sir.

673
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,230
Oh, that's our bus.

674
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,435
Come along, Robert.

675
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,715
Bye bye, Thomas.

676
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,360
Goodbye, old man.

677
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,114
I'll bag seats!

678
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,120
We're not going that far.

679
00:57:15,121 --> 00:57:16,873
Oh, let him, this once.

680
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,587
School's not that much fun.

681
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,751
Two and a child to Piccadilly please.

682
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,186
Two and a child to Piccadilly.

683
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,160
There you go, sir.

684
00:57:25,161 --> 00:57:25,999
Thank you.

685
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,399
Any more fares?

686
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,304
He'll drink himself to
death in the sunshine.

687
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,198
Probably.

688
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,784
Is that where you were going?

689
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:38,920
Yes.

690
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,158
Look, they're really good ones.

691
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,639
Goodness.

692
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,393
Well, put them safely away
until we get home

693
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,392
or you'll get all mucky.

694
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,788
Don't fidget, Bob.

695
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,273
To Flora and Michael, in the hope that

696
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,592
the enclosed might one day
hang in your drawing room.

697
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,600
Thomas.

698
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,550
Who did you go with?

699
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,552
A friend.

700
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,436
He loved me,

701
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,105
but he married me to
be like everybody else.

702
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,430
This is so not okay.

703
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,954
You're leaving a table of friends

704
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,714
just to fuck a complete stranger.

705
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,316
You're not even out, are you?

706
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,666
I bet you've still not told your granny.
