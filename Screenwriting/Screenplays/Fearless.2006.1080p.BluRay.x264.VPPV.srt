JUDGE: The fourth and final contest will now begin.
The competitors are Tanaka from Japan against Huo Yuanjia from the
Jingwu Sports Federation.
Tianjin, Huo's home,
30 years ago.
(EXCLAIMING)
(GASPS)
Young Master, we must leave.
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
Stop!
How dare you!
Who gave you permission to come in?
I am bringing you tea.
How many times have I said you are not allowed in here?
Go practice your calligraphy.
Go on.
(EXCLAIMING)
I do your homework everyday.
You'd be in trouble if your father knew.
Don't say anything, and no one will know.
Come. I want to show you something.
Nong Jinsun, come on!
I'm coming!
WOMAN: Look, they're fighting again.
(CROWD CHATTERING)
(DRUM BEATING)
Today's match is between
Huo Engdi of the Huo Clan and Zhao Zhongqiang of the Zhao Clan.
Why are you two here?
Looking for trouble?
Your father will lose today.
Our Huo wushu will beat your Zhao wushu.
You wait and see.
The death waiver has been signed.
Win or lose, it's up to you.
Live or die, it's up to God.
Gentlemen, let the contest begin!
Zhao, now your father has tasted Huo wushu!
(GASPING)
The winner is
Zhao Zhongqiang!
Thank you!
Yuanjia, let's go home.
Yuanjia, come on.
Let's go home.
Look who's here.
Has the cat got your tongue?
Don't be a wuss.
Act like a man. Get up!
Zhao, you've gone too far!
You shut up!
You're worthless.
Your Huo wushu is even more worthless.
Fight me if you dare.
Then you'll know
Zhao wushu.
Get up there!
(SCREAMING)
(SCREAMING IN PAIN)
Yuanjia, stop!
Stop!
Now that you've had a taste of my wushu, you can shut up about yours.
Yuanjia. Get up, Yuanjia.
Yuanjia, let's get out of here.
I, Huo Yuanjia, swear never to be defeated again!
On your knees.
You're fighting again?
You don't study.
All you do is cause trouble.
Lai.
Yes.
Bring the whip.
Yes.
He's already hurt.
There is no need to beat him again.
Master.
Lai, take him to his room.
Go write Confucius' doctrine
10 times.
I want it before dinner.
Understood?
Yes.
Young Master, let me put some medicine on it.
Lai, you may leave.
Yes.
Why are you upset?
Mother, why doesn't
Father teach me wushu?
Because Father cares about you.
You have asthma.
The training is too much for you.
But it can make me strong.
You want to learn it just to be strong?
When I'm good enough,
I'll take revenge.
I want Zhao to feel our Huo wushu.
My child, wushu is not about winning.
It's about discipline and self-restraint.
One practices wushu for inner strength and to help the weak.
Wushu is not for revenge.
In order for others to respect you, you must first learn how to respect others.
If I'm really good, everyone will fear me.
Fear and respect are two different things.
Now, do your penance.
Don't make your father angry.
(EXCLAIMING) lwon!
Fly! Fly!
You're falling down, falling.
You're falling down, falling.
I'm not falling.
I'm not falling.
Then Father knocks you down.
I'm not falling down.
Faster.
Be careful with her.
(JADE GIGGLING)
Good morning, Mother.
Yuanjia, you didn't take your medicine again.
Mother, since I began training, my asthma has gone.
Look at your daughter.
You've spoiled her since her mother died.
Your daughter needs a mother.
You should marry again.
Mother, I am too busy building up the family reputation.
Soon, everyone in Tianjin will respect the Huo name.
There's no time for marriage.
Father, I want to go to see your fight.
All these years, you haven't lost once.
You are your most formidable enemy.
Your biggest challenge is to win over yourself.
I understand.
Challenge Letter
Young Master.
Oh, yes.
Mother, why not go take a rest?
Father, your fist wasn't fast enough, and your heart wasn't hard enough.
Rest assured, as long as I live, the Huo clan will never lose again.
Huo Yuanjia's Death Waiver
I'll be the Champion of Tianjin.
Father!
Jade.
For me?
No.
Please?
No.
When do I get it?
When you win.
Really?
Yes.
Promise?
MAN: Master Huo, we expect a good fight from you.
Huo Yuanjia, when will you be the champion of Tianjin?
I don't know.
What do you think?
Today! It'll be today!
Death Waiver
Come up!
I have fought in 38 cities in 17 provinces and remain undefeated.
Get up here!
Let's wait and see.
Get up here!
The death waiver has been signed.
Let the contest begin!
(CROWD CHEERING)
Come! Come on up!
What's the matter? Scared?
Afraid you'll fall and hurt yourself?
You wish!
(CROWD CHEERING)
Great!
Master! Great!
I am unyielding like a mountain, and my legs are like strong bedrock.
Today,
Huo wushu becomes history.
Fine, you'll have your chance to lose!
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)
Cat's paw?
Tiger's claw!
Give up!
Great!
Did you think you'd win so easily?
Cat's paw.

(BONES CRACKING)
You've lost!
Be careful!
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)
Master!
Are you okay?
Fine.
So you're still alive.

This way, please,
Master Huo.
Yuanjia!
Jinsun!
You've just arrived?
Your usual table is ready.
MAN 1: Congratulations! MAN 2:
Master Huo, congratulations!
Thanks, thanks.
JINSUN: Come on, drink up.
Jinsun, your restaurant is more popular than ever.
Thanks to all my friends, it's getting by.
When we were young, you were such a nerd.
Who could imagine you'd become such a great businessman?
No one will pay me to read books all day, but being a businessman?
It's a living.
Yuanjia, you must try these.
I've recruited the best chefs from across the country.
Have a taste.
Tell me what you think.
Come, come, eat!
MAN: Master, after you.
I'm Xia Xiang.
I'm Xu Dashan.
Please take us as your disciples.
We want to learn wushu, and we'll devote ourselves to you.
Good.
You look tough enough.
Give them drinks.
Bottoms up and we'll all be brothers.
Cheers!
Master Huo, congratulations!
(ALL CHEERING)
Tonight is a joyous occasion.
Everything's on me.
Enjoy! Have a seat!
It's time for bed.
Go tuck her in.
Miss, it's time for bed.
Be a good girl. Come on.
It's bedtime. Come on.
What is this? It tastes horrible!
It's called coffee.
A Western thing.
Not used to it, are you?
These are turbulent times.
Our country has grown weak.
The West is dominating us.
People like me must not be concerned only with money.
People like you should not be concerned only with fighting.
Our country deserves better.
Politics is for intellectuals.
Being the champion of Tianjin is all I care about.
It's that important to you?
Come.
Let me show you something.
HUO: You've only watched from below.
Now you're standing up here.
Do you feel the difference?
What difference?
When you are down there, life and death up here have nothing to do with you.
It's all entertainment.
But when you are up here, you have to win.
Losing is not an option.
But you can choose not to be here.
Jinsun, listen.
To what?
I don't hear anything.
I can hear.
MAN: Master Huo, you're our hero!
Huo Yuanjia is champion of the world!
Here comes my Head of Iron!
(BONES CRACKING)
Thanks a lot.
That's great!
This is taking too long.
Get everyone who has signed a waiver to come up at once.
All you challengers, get up there!
Huo Yuanjia, when will you be champion of Tianjin?
What do you think?
Today! It'll be today!
What's the matter?
We seek to be your disciples and devote ourselves to you.
Fine, you may join.
A round for everyone.
Come on, give them drinks!
MAN: Master Huo, you're great!
Bottoms up and we'll all be brothers!
Come on, come on.
Master Huo, congratulations!
See you. Have a good day.
H U O: Let's toast.
Master Huo's bills are long overdue.
It's okay.
A toast!
Bring a bigger jug!
You're not drinking?
Now you must drink two more!
You have not fought my godfather, Master Chin.
JINSUN: Yuanjia, you've won
38 fights in a row and defeated every fighter in Tianjin.
There's no one left.
No, you're wrong. There's still one left to beat.
So you're not going to stop?
I have to fight in order to be the true champion of Tianjin.
What about elsewhere?
Beijing, Guangdong, Hunan?
When will you stop?
I know what you're saying.
I cannot stop now.
I can only keep on fighting.
I need to prove that I am the best, the strongest.
For what?
Yuanjia,
I think you need to take a break and reconsider.
What's this?
These are bills from this month's drinking and eating with your disciples.
I'll take care of it.
Of all your freeloading friends and so-called disciples, only a couple are true brothers to you.
In Jianhu, this is called brotherhood.
Brother...
Fine.
I will settle the bills tomorrow.
Yuanjia, I am not here for your money.
Friends should be sincere.
Disciples should be loyal.
Judge them by their integrity, not by their drinking.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
Good morning, Master Huo!
Good morning, Master Chin!
Aren't you the self-proclaimed champion of Tianjin?
What a coincidence.
Master Chin, it's been a long time.
At your age,
I thought you'd retired.
So many new disciples want to join my school,
I couldn't retire even if I wanted to.
Is that so?
Congratulations on the purchase of a coffin for your retirement.
You're too kind.
Actually, this is my gift to you.
Your master needs help.
MAN: Master Chin, this way, please.
Young Master, the income of the wushu school barely oovers the household overhead.
The expenses incurred by your disciples are getting bigger and bigger.
What about the household reserve?
It's been depleted for three months.
Depleted?
Master! Master!
How many times have I told you to hone your skills?
No one listens.
Who did this?
Master Chin.
Master.
Master.
Tonight, we celebrate
Master Chin's birthday, wishing Master Chin a long and prosperous life.
Terrific!
Godfather, we wish you good fortune and great health.
Great!
Master Huo, today's my godfather's birthday.
These tables are reserved.
As a favor to me, please drink somewhere else.
Please do me a favor.
You don't qualify to speak to me.
I'm not in the mood to fight on my birthday.
Maybe some other time.
As a master, you should be ashamed of yourself.
You injured my disciple.
I'm here to settle the score.
What do you want?
Here is my signature.
Sign yours if you dare.
Otherwise, kneel down and apologize.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Let me through. Yuanjia!
You've crossed the line.
Let's not do this in front of all the guests.
My disciple is hurt.
I must do something.
I don't care what happened, you mustn't spoil their celebration.
I'm not here to spoil anything.
Yuanjia. You're afraid I might trash your place?
I'll pay for all damages.
I can't believe you just said that.
You should go.
Forget that we've ever been friends.
You're asking me to leave?
You're willing to throw away our friendship?
My sword seeks vengeance.
Everybody out!
Stay at your own peril.

Master, I'm very sorry.
It's all my fault.
I got drunk. I insulted
Master Chin's concubine.
He was defending his honor, and that's how I got injured.

My eyesight began to fail when I was 13.
Everything turned blurry.
I cried a lot.
My grandma told me,
"Cry if you are sad.
"When there are no more tears, life will go on."
I can see everything in my heart.
Do you believe me?
I'll wash your hair.
Your hair will get knotted if you don't wash it often.
Grandma always says,
"Cleanliness brings purity to life."
Every knot can be untangled.
Ox!
Ox, you sleep a lot.
You sleep as much as our ox.
That's why we call you Ox.
Come this way.
Let's catch some dragonflies.
(BUZZING)
Cheer up.
You will get over it.
Eat something.
Tomorrow, you should take him to work in the fields.
He'll feel better.
Yes.

Ox.
Ox, Ox, Ox, come, quick. Come on.
Come over.
Look. Moon told me not to say anything.
You did a bad job.
She is re-planting for you.
Crops have lives of their own.
If you plant them too olose together, they will not grow.
Just like people, they need to respect each other in order to live together peacefully.
I'll always remember.
Grandma, let's eat.
Sure.
Grandma!
Moon.
Yes, Grandma?
It'll be the Day of the Dead in a few days.
We should visit your parents' graves.
Yes.
Have a drink of water.
Can we talk?
You are leaving?
I was thinking that maybe I should visit my parents' graves.
Family is important.
You should go.
I'll come back soon.
You have been here for so many years.
Yet, I've always known that one day you would leave.
The truth is, I...
Take these clean clothes for your trip.
You don't even know my real name.
You don't have to tell me.
I don't need to know where you're from or where you're going.
You will always be Ox to me.
My name is Huo Yuanjia.
I'll always remember.

You've finally returned.
Let me take your bag.
Please forgive me. I haven't kept the house in order.
Young Master, please forgive me.
I did my best to keep everything the way it was for you to return home.
It must have been very hard for you.
I'm sorry for not doing better.
After you left, the creditors came every day, tearing this place apart.
The house was almost foreclosed.
We would have lost everything, but someone sent money.
I later realized it was your good friend,
Mr. Nong Jinsun.
I don't need these anymore.
Neither do my parents.
Father, please forgive me.
I've finally realized why you held back the last blow.
You are the true champion of Tianjin.
Mother, you taught me how to be a good person.
I was too arrogant to understand.
Rest assured, I will not disappoint you again.
My dear Jade,
I didn't take good care of you.
You suffered because of me.
I was not a good father.
Get out of here, you filthy scum!
You come here with no money?

Forgive us.
I studied wushu with you all my life.
I know no other way of making a living.

We have no jobs.
It's so great to have you back.

You can get up.

I know you can't forgive me, but I wanted to come and see you.
I don't want to talk about the past.
What do you want?
Jinsun.
It's hard for me to ask, but you're the only one
I can turn to.
I need to borrow some money.
What for? Another fight?
Yes.
I need some money to go to Shanghai.
The prize money is important to me.
If it's for another fight, then you can forget about the loan.

Ladies and gentlemen,
(IN CHINESE) today, you are about to meet a man who can move a train with one hand and punch through the Great
Wall with his bare fist.
He can kill a Chinese fighter with his little finger.
Now, let's welcome the strongest man in history,
O'Brien!
Today's challenger is
Huo Yuanjia of Tianjin!
Sign the death waiver.
Please inform him that taking a life in a competition is a cruel and backward
Chinese tradition.
May I suggest that we compete with honor and civility.

Huo Yuanjia ls Starting the Jingwu Sports Federation
(IN ENGLISH) Thank you once again.
Thank you.
(IN CHINESE) Master, you've received a dinner invitation.
I didn't know the invitation was from you.
When did you come to Shanghai?
Your friendship is important to me.
Very important.
Come, have a seat, Yuanjia.
Here, your favorite wine.
What's the matter?
I've stopped drinking.
A long time ago.
But you used to love to drink.
I've learnt from my mistakes.
That's wonderful.
Let's have tea instead.
Yuanjia.
Your victory gained respect for all Chinese people.
The foreigners have bullied us for too long.
Someone should stand up to them.
Why do foreigners look down on us?
Because we're not united.
It's a fact. For years, we fought, Chinese against Chinese.
That's why the West belittles us.
"Weak men of the East," what an insult!
But that isn't the worst of it.
Some of us don't even realize how sick the country is.
You really understand what's going on.
Jinsun, when do you return to Tianjin?
I'm going to stay here in Shanghai.
What about your restaurant?
I sold it.
What?
But it was so profitable.
The Jingwu Sports Federation needs start-up funds.
But the restaurant has been your life.
My restaurant means little compared to your vision.
Yuanjia, I don't know wushu, but I do know how to help.
I hope it will be enough.
Jingwu Sports Federation
As we've discussed, the
Jingwu Federation handbook.
Take a look.
"The Jingwu motto has three parts:
"body, mind and soul.
"Wushu is a way to cultivate one's body, mind and soul.
"All wushu disciplines are respected equally.
"By working together,
"we can better ourselves
"and stand strong as one nation."
We influence others through cooperation, not intimidation.
Through this ideal, we will always stand strong!
Ready?
(IN ENGLISH) Well, gentlemen, it's too rich for me.
I only bet on sure things.
Then perhaps you'd be interested in joining our little wager against this Yuanjia fellow.
I've suggested a competition of four matches between our countries' best against him.
We beat him and leave the Chinese with nothing to brag about.
Mita, you are certain
Yuanjia will lose?
With what I have in mind, our victory is guaranteed.
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)
Yuanjia.
One of the Japanese contestants,
Tanaka, wishes to meet you.
Ihear he remains undefeated.
Good, one can always learn from the best.
Yuanjia, I suspect that the
Foreign Chamber of Commerce might have a hidden agenda.
How can they set up a four-against-one contest?
I suspect it is an attempt to humiliate us and undermine the Jingwu
Sports Federation in Shanghai.
You're right.
Four against one is unfair, and I have to win every match.
Yet who is to guarantee that everything in life is fair?
For the sake of the Federation,
I have no other choice.
What if...
Jinsun, there's something
I want to ask you.
What is it?
After the contest, I need you to run the Federation.
Why?
I want to visit
Moon and Grandma.
I promised Moon
I would return.
Do you know anything about teas, Mr. Huo?
I don't really want to know because I don't like categories.
Tea is tea.
Each has its own characteristics, hence different grades.
What's the purpose of grading?
All teas are grown in nature with little discernable differences.
Once you learn, you can tell the difference.
Maybe you're right.
The way I see it, the tea is not in a position to judge itself.
We should let people be the judge of the tea.
As for me,
I don't want to do that.
Why not?
When you are in a good mood, the grade of the tea does not matter.
I've never seen it that way.
Even with the various wushu styles, you still claim that no one style is superior to the others?
That's what I believe.
Then I have another question.
If no particular style is superior, why have so many competitions?
I believe it is impossible to claim the superiority of one style over another.
It's just that the people who practice them have different skill levels.
Competitions can help us uncover our weaknesses and discover that we are our own true enemy.
Mr. Huo, your words are poignant.
Please enjoy.
Thank you.
The fourth and final contest will now begin.
In this round,
Tanaka of Japan will fight
Huo Yuanjia of China's
Jingwu Sports Federation.
(IN JAPANESE) This is unfair.
Four against one?
You never told me.
Both the Chamber of Commerce and the Federation agreed.
Don't be concerned.
This is not a competition.
This is murder.
Tanaka, you're overreacting.
Huo Yuanjia has fought the best fighters from around the world and has won every time.
He agreed to the rules.
Mr. Mita, what's your deal?
Is this really for Japan's national pride?
Or did you place a large bet?
To compete is to win.
(m CHINESE) Begin!
Master Huo, this is an unfair contest.
If you wish to fight at some other time, it would be fine with me.
I appreciate your thoughtfulness.
We started the fight.
Let's finish it.
Please.
Begin!
Great! That's great!
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

Poison.
Poison?
What poison?
How did this happen?
What do you need?
Tea...
Tea!
What's wrong with the tea?
The tea is poisoned, but the evidence is gone.
Yuanjia, we're going to the hospital.
Too late.
I've exerted too much strength.
The toxin is in my blood.
Master, let me take revenge!
Zhensheng, we must not take revenge.
Revenge only brings more bloodshed.
That's not what I want.
We must strive to better ourselves.
Yuanjia, forget the competition.
We're going to the hospital.
Let's go.
Jinsun,
I'm just a fighter.
It took me years to understand the true meaning of wushu and its purpose.
The competition is not over.
One cannot choose how one's life begins, but one can choose to face the end with courage.
Master.
(IN JAPANESE) What are you doing?
Finish him off!
Why do you say that?
It's not for you to decide.
Whatever it takes, just win.
(IN CHINESE) Stand strong!
Stand strong! Stand strong!

(IN JAPANESE)
You really want to win?
(IN CHINESE) Let's stop.

It would be my honor.
