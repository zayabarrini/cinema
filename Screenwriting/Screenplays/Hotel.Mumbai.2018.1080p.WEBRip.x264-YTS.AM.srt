Your sister didn't come. Again.
She's at home with the flu.
Sorry.

Why are you crying?
Why are you crying?
[chattering]
[Brother on phone, in Punjabi]
Look around you, my brothers.
Look at all they've stolen...
From your fathers.
From your grandfathers.
Remember your training.
Don't draw attention to yourselves.
Don't be late to your destinations.
Timing is critical.
Start with the train station first.
All other targets within the next 30 minutes.
Remember, the whole world will be watching.
[in English] More hot water.
Make it 48 degrees. Exactly 48.
- What is this?
- What?
Blue jumpsuit.
It's a boy. Blue! Blue!
Um, but Sanjay said it's a girl.

They should be arriving any minute now.

- Namaste.
[Dilip]
Congratulate them on the baby, but do not mention the wedding.
[Prahba] They're not married?
[Dilip] They are, but Zahra was already pregnant.
So the mother insisted on a private ceremony.
No publicity.
[David] Oh, wow.

[Dilip] Have you booked their dinner reservations?
Yes, sir. 9:00 p.m. at the Shamiana.

If she changes her mind and we don't have room, her mother is gonna kill me.
[Prahba] Doing it now, sir.
This way.
Welcome back to the Taj.

Shall I call a doctor just to be on the safe side?
Yeah.
Just to be on the safe side.
[Jomon] And your 9:00 p.m. reservation at the Shamiana?
I don't know. What do you think?
- You wanna get room service?

You could always just nip back up when he gets here.
I'll keep your reservation.
And you come at your convenience, or not.
- As you wish.

Relax. Good.
Is this a joke?
Forgive me, sir.
I... I lost my shoes.
They must've fallen from my bag.
Go home, Arjun.
Everyone else, let's move.
Sir. Sir, please.
Please what?
You look like a beggar.
Sir, please. I'll find some shoes.
I need this shift.
You need to leave.
Sir. Sir, please.
My wife's going to give birth any day now.
Please.
There's an extra pair of shoes in my room.
Under the desk.
Thank you, sir.
Hurry up!

[man on TV] Here in
India's wealthiest city...
...five star
Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.
It's been home for over a century to statesmen and celebrities from across the globe.
Experience for yourself its otherworld luxury...
[woman on TV] Armed gunmen have just attacked CST station,
Mumbai's main railway terminal, gunning down more than
100 passengers and staff.
Security cameras captured images of these two suspects who fled the scene firing at pedestrians...
[sirens wailing]
[in Punjabi]
Behind the car!
We'll kill these fuckers.
All of them!
- [siren stops]
- [tires screech]
Let's go!
Kill the bastards!
Kill them all.
[police radio chatter]
[woman on TV, in English] The biggest worry at this point in time is that... there is a fear amongst the cops who are still trying to figure out the source of firing and if a police car has been hijacked
- by the perpetrators of this gun battle.
- [siren wailing]
This is the biggest fear right now in the minds of the police because there was a point where there... There came a gun...
- [gunfire]
- [crowd screaming]
[man on TV] Well, there you saw...
You saw a police van,
- [man wails]
- a police Toyota Qualis, being driven... and indiscriminate fire.
Sir, these are for the Sindhi wedding in the Ocean Room.
The kimchis are for the trade delegation in Wasabi.
The MPs are already at the Harbour Bar, quite drunk.
Mm-hmm.
More lemongrass, sir?
Arjun... stop limping.
- Yeah, more lemongrass.
- Thank you.
What about the Russian?
Booked into the Shamiana, sir.
He has party later.
He wants help.
Okay. Everyone.
Everyone, listen in, please.
Come on.
Leave that. Come on.
Come here. Come here. Yes.
Okay. Come on. Come, hurry up.
[speaks in Hindi]
[in English] So... we have another VIP guest dining at the Shamiana tonight.
Vasili Gordetsky.
- Sir.
- [head chef] He can be difficult.
Mr. Gordetsky, so nice to see you again.
[head chef] Whatever he says, just smile, be polite, be courteous.
Remember, always, here at the Taj, guest is God.
Under no circumstances you are to recommend seafood to him.
- [indistinct]
- [head chef] He's allergic to it.
Never, ever serve him drink in a glass.
Always a bottle.
And make sure that you open the bottle in front of him, directly.
[in Russian]
I'll take the one... with curly hair.
Yes, she's sexy.
And... also...
The tall one.
What did he say?
Give him the phone.
[in English] The tall one.
She has big nipples or small nipples?
Good. Okay, send them both.
Who speaks like that?
After dinner, Mr. Gordetsky is having a private party in his suite.
He will need a waiter.
Of course, there will be large tips.
Sir, Olga speaks Russian.
No. Never a female staff.
We can't have a repeat of last time.
- Sir, I would be honored to serve...
- No thank you, Arjun.
Sir, please,
I will ensure that...
You will ensure that you arrive in the proper footwear.
Sanjay, you will serve at the Russian's party tonight.
Go to Elia's and get two bottles of Vernier Dejeune.
- [Sanjay] Wanjidon. Thank you, sir.
- What did you say?
"Wanjidon".
What is "Wanjidon"?
It's Vernier Dejeune.
Verdijan.
It is Vernier Dejeune.
With V.
V. Ver...
- It's with V. Vernier Dejeune.
- V. Ver...
- Don't repeat V. Just say Vernier Dejeune.
- V...
Not V! Vernier Dejeune!
Wanjidon.
[sighs]
Vernier Dejeune.
It's a cognac.
Go!
Werdijan. Werdijan.
Thank you, sir. Werdijan.
[horns honking]
You won't believe the kind of women he's got coming over tonight.
The Russian guy, yeah.
Ha. Aye, they're knockouts.
Ten out of ten, man.
Yeah.
- Come in... in an hour. Yeah.
- [car approaching]
- [tires screech]
- Oi!
[in Hindi]
Are you fucking blind?
You didn't see me coming?!
You didn't see?!
[Sanjay]
Who drives like this?!
You can't see straight!
You jumped in front of my car!
So what, you'd run me over?!
[in English]
What are you looking at?
Go!
Go!
[in Hindi]
What's your problem?!
[man, in English]
Check these dudes out.
- He's going off. Look.
- [argument continues]
They are going nuts.
Look at him.
Look at the little angry butler.
Look at him. [laughs]
- Babe. Babe. Hi. Eddie.
- Check him out.
I'm putting money on the little butler man.
- Taj.

Let's go.
We're going to the Taj.

- We're going to the Taj.
Um, hang on. Let's go.
Uh, excuse me, sir.
- Namaste, mate.
- Namaste.
I think we've got a little problem here because, um, we... we didn't order this pork thing.
Yes.
[chuckles] No, no, no.
I don't think so.
Because if you just look here, we didn't actually...
- [gunshot]
- [woman screams]
Fuck! Bree, get down!
[car alarm blaring]
[whimpering quietly]
[rapid gunfire]
[Eddie] This way.
Come on, come on! Go! Go! Run!
- Go, babe! Go!
- [explosion]
Come on, go! Come on!
Come on!
- Are you hurt?
- I don't know. I don't think so.
If I may, uh...
2003 was a very good year for Bordeaux due to the exceptional heat wave that year.
Uh, the Château Latour, there...
Amazing depth, powerful yet silky, dark fruit, seamless finish.
It's a very good wine.
- Hm. Yeah.
- That sounds nice.
Um...
You know what? Why don't you just bring me a JD and Diet Coke.
- Really?
- Yeah.
And you know what? Bring us a cheeseburger for old times' sake.
[Arjun] Chicken or fish, sir?
No. Just a regular burger. Beef.
Oh. They don't have beef here.
- Yeah. They got everything here.
- Honey, cows are sacred in India.
- I am so sorry. I completely spaced. Uh...
- It's okay.
Okay, so what do you recommend?
What's...
- The lamb kofta is popular with Americans.
- Hi, Sally.
Hey, Zahra.
No. I've just checked in with reception.
They said the doctor's still on their way.
[baby cooing]
No, no. He's more than fine.
Yeah, he had a big feed and I just put him down.
Sure, I'll call you then.
But, really, we're all good.
Okay.
Enjoy.
Thank you, sir. And how would you like to make the payment?
[chattering]
[man on phone, in Hindi] There's been an attack. Is the hotel safe?!
Yes, of course.
[man]
So everything is okay there?
Yes, sir. All okay here.
[in English]
Good evening, Taj Palace Hotel.
Hi there.
Just checking about the doctor.
Okay. So, next trip,
I have an idea.
Let's go, just the two of us.
Yeah, I'd like that.
- [Eddie] Christ! Go!
- [panicked chattering]
Come on!
Come on! Go!
Run!
Please, please, open.
[all clamoring]
...door, man.
Just fucking open the door!
My girlfriend's...
This is my girl...
Security.
Can we get security, now?
Dilip, look.
[Bree] Eddie!
We've got a reservation, mate.
[Dilip] Let them in.
It's okay. Let them all in.
Bree, we're in.
Thank you. Thank you.
Bree, come on, babe.
Come on.
Excuse me.
- [Bree] Eddie, let's go somewhere else.
- [Eddie] Lani, is it?
Ah. Wow, wow.
[in Punjabi]
Have you ever seen such a place?
Imran...
It's just a hotel.
It looks like paradise.
[man coughs]
Let's unpack here.
A bit further back.
[Vasili, in Russian] The girls are in my suite already?
Okay.
Start without me, and I'll be up after dinner.
[no audible dialogue]
[water running]
[typing]
[in English] Sir,
I have no record of your booking.
Please, if we could just...
- Listen, would you please call our family?

[woman screams]

Please, under the tables.
Bree!
Under the tables.
Down, down, please, please!
Please, down.
Down, down, sir, please.
- Who are they? They have machine guns.
- Sir, down. You must hide.

[mouthing] Go.
[panting]

- It's okay. It's okay.
Pick up, Sally.
Hey.
[cell phone ringing]
[in Punjabi]
Phase one is complete, Brother.
We're moving upstairs.
[Brother] Well done, you've done good work.
One thing...
Keep your phone on at all times.
I want to hear their cries with my own ears.
These animals have no humanity,
Abdullah, remember this.
Yes Brother.
None of them deserve Allah's mercy.
Yes Brother. God is great.
God is great.
[woman breathing shakily]
[in English] Hello?
- Sir, sir, this is the reception.

This is the reception.
There's a security issue here. No.

I'll be in touch, sir.
Yes, sir. Yeah.
Room service.

Just a second.

Don't answer the door.

She's here somewhere.
I saw her come in.

[speaking in Farsi]
[sobbing quietly]
[muffled whine]
[in Punjabi]
Houssam?
Houssam, come here!
Look at this.
Look, they have a machine to flush their shit.
Even shitting is fun.
[Brother]
Imran?
Oh...
Hello, Brother.
Imran! What's happening?
I've just finished killing another woman.
Well done.
Now listen...
I have to tell you something.
Yes, Brother?
Stand them up in a doorway next time.
So when the bullet goes through their heads, it goes outside.
You don't want it ricocheting back into the room.
Okay?
Okay, Brother. Okay.
There are a few people gathered downstairs, throw some grenades at them.
There's no harm in throwing a few grenades, my brother.
Grenades?
[Brother]
Yes! Yes!
[Imran]
Yes, Brother.
We will give them a surprise.
[Brother]
Throw some grenades.
[Imran]
Okay, okay, Brother.
[Houssam]
What did he say?
He said "Throw the grenades."
[Houssam] Yeah, we've got some.
Let's throw them.
[Cameron gurgles]
Shh, shh, shh.
[Cameron crying, muffled]
[sobbing]
[phone vibrates]
[in English] What is happening?
Where's Cameron?
There were men with guns. Just boys.
They... They came in, but we hid.

[crying continues]
[sobbing] There was a woman that came in and they... they just shot her...
Okay, okay. You stay right where you are.

Look at me.
I need you to stay right here.
I need you to be strong, okay?
I love you so much.

We've called you five times.
Please, send someone.

Do you have a family?
Yes, and I hope to stay alive and see them.

I need to pee.
Use this. Okay?
- You piss in this. I'm not an animal.
- No, madam. Please.
Please. No, madam. Please.
[cell phone ringing]
[ringing continues]
[Zahra gasps]
Madam, this way. Hurry.
[Abdullah speaking Punjabi]
[panting]
[elevator dings]
[in Punjabi]
Rashid!
Try this.
[Rashid]
What is it?
[Imran]
It's very tasty, try it.
[Rashid]
You ate this?!
Go on, try it.
You moron!
This is pork, throw it away!

[Imran coughing]
Take it, take it.

You dumbass, they're vegetables.

Why are you getting angry?
[Imran]
Go away.
[Rashid]
Imran, I was just kidding!
[Imran]
Get fucked.

[cart rattles]
[breathes sharply]

Who are these people?
What do they want with us?
Hey. Shh, shh.
Will you message Zahra for me?
Can you tell her we made it okay?
Yeah.
[David] It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay. Shh.
It's gonna be okay.
[woman on TV]
Mumbai under siege.
Chaos has erupted in India's financial capital with multiple bombings and reports of armed gunmen rampaging though the city.
[in Hindi] Papa will come home and we'll play together.
It's okay, Seva.
It's okay.
It's okay...
It's okay.
[woman on TV, in English] ...and luxury hotels are all under attack.
Local police are simply not trained or equipped to deal with multiple military grade attacks of this magnitude.
What you're seeing now is chaos outside the celebrated Taj Hotel.
Terrorists have laid siege to the landmark property, with as many as 1,000 guests and over 500 staff trapped inside.
Mumbai has no Special
Forces units of its own, meaning tactical units must be sent in from New Delhi over 800 miles away.
They are hours away at the very least.
And it is bedlam here on the ground at the Taj.
[in Marathi]
Get them back!
Hey, cameras back! Go back!
Cameras get back! Get them back!
Get them back now!
[explosion]
- [shutters clicking]
- [crowd murmuring]
I've got four men.
-Only four?
-Yes.
We have to do something.
Special Forces are hours away, they're still in Delhi.
-Still in Delhi?!
-Yes.
And we have orders to stand down until they arrive.
We have to do something...
The CCTV room is on the second floor.
So?
So?!
We'll go up there!
We'll see their positions!
We can't just wait here.
[Eddie] Help! Help me!
Help!
- [crowd exclaims]
- [thud]
[Eddie yells, groans]
[Eddie coughs, sobs]
My girlfriend. My girlfriend.
She's still in there.
Bree. Bree! Bree!
[rapid gunfire in distance]
[in Marathi]
If we just stand here... there won't be anyone left.
Okay. Okay. CCTV room.
[clicking, murmuring continue]
[sirens, gunfire in distance]
There's still shooting downstairs and in the east wing.
Safest would be go up to the Chambers Lounge.
Yes, sixth floor.
Okay, Arjun.
Okay. Call me if you hear anything.
Service stairs are all clear.
But our guests are trapped all through the hotel.
I think we should try and gather whoever we can... and take them to the Chambers Lounge and wait for the police to arrive.
Sir, Olga made it through the back exit.
We can do the same.
Yes, but our guests can't.
Not all of them.
Sir, I have four kids at home.
I know, Dilip.
Nobody is forcing you to stay.
So, whoever wants to try and make it out... this is your time.
[inhales]
I'm sorry, sir.
Don't apologize.
Go.
Many of you have wives, parents, families at home.
There is no shame in leaving.
I've been here 35 years.
This is my home.
- I'm staying too.
- I'm staying too.
- I'm with you, sir.
- I'm with you, sir.
[man] Me too.
Guest is God, sir.
Follow me.
[muffled explosion]
[Vasili, in English] Here.
Wrap that around your head.
So they know you are one of them.
I'm not one of them.
Sir, madam.
I just spoke to my boss.
He says we should come upstairs to the Chambers Club.
- We'll be safer there.
- Why?
You know something?
How many there are, where they are?
I'm not sure, sir. But the Chambers, sir, is the most secure place in the hotel...
I know what the fucking Chambers is.
- Is the passage clear?
- Yes, sir.
We... We'll go via the service stairs.
We'll leave in a couple of minutes, okay?
[woman 1 on TV] Survivors speak of gunmen dressed in western clothes,
- [cell phone vibrates]
- coolly and methodically mowing down commuters in cold blood.
[woman 2 on TV]
Bloodstains here.
These are the first pictures of those bloodstains.
An unknown number of gunmen now fully control the Taj Hotel.
And according to this witness, are methodically executing hotel guests floor by floor and room by room.
[man on TV] They had bombs.
There was a lot of smoke. And they...
[Sally] Shh. Dad, you need to calm down.
I'm fine.
[woman 1 on TV]
...to fight urban warfare.
Well, I don't know what they're saying, but I promise you, I'm okay.
No, I know. I'm safe and I'm in the hotel room.
[man on TV] They wanted anyone with British or American passports.
[Sally] Look, the police are here now, so
I'm sure we'll be out of here any minute.
- [siren wails]
- [whistle blowing]
The fourth floor.
No. They haven't come up here.
They won't.
I gotta go, Dad.
I'll call you when we're out, okay?
[woman on TV] ...inclusion of
Chabad house, a Jewish center, on the list of targets adds credence to the view that Muslim fundamentalists are responsible.
The eight hostages at Chabad include
Jewish American rabbi, Gavriel Holtzberg, and his wife Rivky who is six months pregnant.
Wait here.
I'll signal if it's safe, okay?
[quietly] Come, come.
Come, come. Quiet.
[Arjun whispers]
Come, come.
[Arjun whispers]
Come, come.
[door locks]
[whispers]
[whispers]
[pounding on door]
[Arjun]
Mr. Oberoi, sir. Are you there?
- [pounding on door]
- Sir.
Sir. Sir, it's me,
Arjun from Shamiana.
Okay.
[metal clanks]
- [panting]
- Arjun.
Please come. Come, come.
Nothing to fear. Please come.
Yes. Please.
Hi.
How are we feeling?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Everything is fine.
[Jomon] Please, please. This way.
Take a seat. We have water...
- Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
- Jomon.
I'm so sorry. Everything will be fine now.
You're totally safe.
Sit anywhere you like, okay?
No problem. Please, please.
[chef] Welcome, sir.
- I would like a cognac. Vernier Dejeune.
- Of course. Of course, sir.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.
Take a seat, sir.
[claps]
Ladies and gentlemen.
May I have your attention, please?
Can you come closer?
Arjun, can you just help them?
Little further. I don't...
I don't want to speak loudly. Please.
Can you come closer, sir?
Sir, ma'am? Please.
Sir, you can...
Can you come forward, please? Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I am Hemant Oberoi, head chef here at the Taj.
We are all terribly sorry for everything you've had to endure here tonight.
But please be rest assured the worst is behind us now.
The Chambers is an exclusive club.
Very difficult to access.
As you can see, there are no internal windows and every entrance has been secured.
We will be safe here until police comes and fetches us.
[man] When will that be?
- [woman] What's taking them so long?
- [Oberoi] Ma'am.
They're outside right now.
It's just a matter of time.
Yes, what's important is that we remain calm and quiet because we want our position to remain a secret.
[man on TV] The situation inside the hotel is becoming utterly desperate.
Footage just in of this man forced to flee on a rope improvised...
Come on. We should get going.
Going? Where?
The staff's moving everybody up to the
Chambers Lounge on the sixth floor.
They said it'll be safer.
No way.
Sally. Come on.
You can go.
I'm not going anywhere.
David. There are men with guns out there that are just killing people in the hallway.
- There's no way that I'm going out there.
- I know.
And Zahra's out there and she's by herself.
[sobbing] They came in here.
They fucking shot her, David.
Like a fucking rabbit.
And if we move and if the baby wakes up,
- they're gonna shoot us too.
- Okay, okay. Okay.
[breathes shakily] I mean, the cops are already outside.
Can't we just wait for them to come and get us?
Yeah.
Okay.
[Sally sighs]

[muffled rapid gunfire]
[muffled] Kanu!
[muffled] Kanu!
Kanu!
[Kanu groans]
[woman on TV] It's been a night and a morning of gun battles in Mumbai.
Perhaps never before has a city been attacked in a coordinated yet random and completely mindless manner.
There have been hours and hours of indiscriminate terror on the streets of Mumbai and we still don't seem to be at the end of it.
Let's get you the big headlines from Mumbai.
At least 78 people are dead and nearly 200 injured in a series of attacks in south Mumbai.
Three five-star hotels, a petrol pump in Colaba, the CST station, the Cama
Hospital, all come under attack.
Mumbai's majestic Taj Hotel is still burning while gun battles continue between security forces and terrorists.
[whispered murmuring]
Would you like a drink?
How much longer, Mr. Savanth?
You're the chief of police.
What's going on?
[Savanth on phone]
The head of our terror squad was gunned down in his car tonight, Mr. Oberoi.
And Special Forces are yet to leave Delhi.
Still in Delhi?
Then send somebody from here.
Use the police force for God's sake.
We sent in a local squad an hour ago but we haven't heard a word since.
[Mrs. Kashani on phone, in Farsi]
God is watching over you my child.
Close your eyes, let's pray together.
[in Farsi]
Prayers?
What good have prayers ever done us, Mother?
[Mrs. Kashani]
What can I say?
I'm worried about you.
[in English] I'm sorry.
I just wanna be home.
[Mrs. Kashani, in Farsi]
I love you. I'll pray for you.
[in Farsi]
I'll call you.
Okay, my dear.
[in English]
Who were you speaking with?
What?
Who were you talking to on the phone?
None of your business.
[gasps] She's one of them.
- What are you trying to say?
- You're talking that language.
Are you calling me a terrorist?
- What are you trying to say? Just say it.
- Why won't you answer?
Why won't you tell me who you were...
She's with me.
- I need you to tell me. She's one...
- Hey. Shut your mouth.
Shut up. Walk away.
Your behavior is disgraceful.
- Go fuck yourself. Walk away.
- Shh. Shh.
Madam, come. Come.
It's okay, sir. It's okay.
[woman] I saw her.
With everything going on, that's what she tells me?
- You're okay?
- No, seriously.
Don't worry.
She's total bitch.
Come, come.
Look at that face.
She's not been fucked for ten years.
Minimum.
[scoffs]
- Hey.
- Thank you.
Is crazy situation but we just have to wait.
We'll be fine.
Arjun. Arjun.
[Arjun] Sorry.
- Yes, sir.
- See the English woman over there?
At the food station?
Ha.
She's worried about your beard.
- My beard.
- Uh-huh.
Also your turban.
Hang back in the kitchen for a little bit, huh?
Good boy.
[Arjun] Madam.
[stammers] I'd like to show you something.
This is my family.
This is my... This is my child.
Here's Seva.
That's my wife and her quite... quite awful sister.
This is my...
This is my pagri.
To us Sikhs it is... it is sacred.
It's a... It's a symbol of honor and courage.
Since I was a small boy,
I've never gone outside without it.
To do so would...
It would bring shame to my family.
But... while we are in this hotel, you are my guest.
And I am your staff.
So, if it would make you feel comfortable, I will take it off.
Would you like that?
No.
No.
I'm just scared.
We all are.
But... to get through this, we must... must stick together.
Okay?
Yes. Indeed.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- I'll bring you some water. Okay?
Okay.
- Hello?
- [woman on phone] Hello.
- Mrs. Watson.
- Yes, yes?
- This is Lani from the hotel reception.
- Yes.
Ma'am, the rescue team is on your floor.
- They are?
- Yeah.
- They're on their way, ma'am.
- Thank God.
Yes, yes. I can hear them.
Alex. Alex, let them in.

[woman panting]
Mr. Oberoi, sir. It's Prahba.

[screams]
[man] Hey, be quiet!
[gasping]
[screams]
We need to tape this hole shut and then we make a sling for her arm.
- Elastoplast, Sellotape...
- First aid box. [speaks in Hindi]
- Come. Hold this. Hold tight here.
- [groans]
It's not good.
I think she's bleeding into her chest cavity.
There's no way to save her without getting her to a hospital.
- I'll take her.
- Too risky.
If she stays, she'll die.
[Bree groaning, panting]
Sir, please let me take her.
We go down the back stairs and straight out the service exit.
Arjun, if they find you, they find us.
But if I make it, we'll have a way out.
- [Bree screams]
- [woman] Shh.
We can't just let her die here.
Okay.
Call me when you get out.
It's okay.
Madam? Madam? Madam?
I'm going to get you out of here, okay?
But there are some stairs.
Do you think you can stand?
Yes? Okay. Come on.
Slowly. Come on.
- That's it.
- [moans]
- [Oberoi] Ma'am, you will be fine.
- Okay.
You'll be fine.
Arjun is with you. Don't worry.
Everybody please settle down.
Everything will be fine.
[Cameron coos]

Move. Move. Move.
[Imran, in Punjabi]
Hang on, Brother. I'll check.
Seems Chinese.
Could be Japanese.
But she's dressed like an American.
[Brother] Good, we want Americans.
But alive next time.
We need rich hostages.
Important hostages.
[Imran]
No passport, no wallet. Nothing.
Check her bra.
Put your hand in her bra and check there.
[sighs]
No, I'm so sorry Brother...
I can't touch her there.
[Brother] She's an infidel.
It's not a sin.
Check.
Imran, check now.
[Brother] Imran?
- [Cameron whines]
- Go, go, go.
[Sally] David.
Open the door. Open the door.

[cell phone beeps]
[line ringing]

-Hello sir.
-Yes, Patel?
We've reached the CCTV room.
There's only two of us left.
Send more men.
[man] I can't, there's too many VIPs inside.
We've got orders to wait for Special Forces.
- [in English] Okay, sir.
- [phone clicks]
Hey.
[in Hindi]
Where is this room?
- [in English] The front lobby here.

Western entrance hall or Ocean Room.
There's still some of the good stuff left.
Single malt.
Twenty years old.
[sobs]
[explosion]
What the hell was that?
[knocking]
[Abdullah, in Hindi] Colaba Police.
Open up.
Stay here. Stay down.
[knocking]
[man on phone] It's chaos out here, sir.
We're doing all we can.
Have you sent the men in?
- I'm sorry, what men?

Yes, Mr. Oberoi.
We sent in a squad hours ago.
But most were killed.
[Abdullah]
Mohit Singh.
Colaba Police, open up.
Have you sent any Mohit Singh as part of the squad?
[in Hindi]
We are here to save you.
[in Hindi]
There's another one!
Main lobby.
[in English] Shit.

Lounge, there are many people there.
[man] Yes, Mr. Oberoi.
Mohit Singh was part of the squad.

Open up, motherfuckers.

Out!
Out, out!

How many people are in there?!
At least fifty, could be more by now.
Fifty people?
[shouting in Punjabi]
[all clamoring]
[in Marathi]
How many bullets do you have?
Six.
You?
Same.
[in Punjabi]
Open up!
Open up, fuckers!
None of you will be spared!
Okay.
[in Hindi] Stay here and lock the door, okay?
Thank you.
[grunting]
Shh, shh, shh. Quiet, quiet.
Down, down, down.
Down. Down, down.
Open up, motherfuckers!
[Abdullah continues shouting]
[in Marathi]
It's just one guy. Get ready.
[in Punjabi]
Abdullah?
Abdullah? What is it?
[in Marathi]
There's two more!
[Abdullah, in Punjabi] There are people in there. I heard noises.
[in Marathi]
We've got to shoot them.
Kill them all.
No, no, no.
Shoot!
[Imran screams]
[screams]
[gunmen chattering]
- [Houssam] They have gone this side.
- [Abdullah] Houssam, be careful.
Houssam?
Are they behind us?!
I don't know.
- [woman whimpers]
- [Oberoi] Shh, shh, shh.
[sobs]
No, no.
- Hey, hey. It's okay.
- [sniffles]
It's okay.
Doctor? We need a medic please.
[explosion in distance]
[woman on TV] That was an explosion.
There's lots of firing inside the hotel.
Here they come.
They're coming down the steps of the Taj.
We're right here at the Taj where this action is unfolding.
[Imran]
Hey, Houssam...
Do you believe the Bull will give the money to our families?
- [knocks]
- [sighs]
Imran, we're in service of Allah...
Nothing else matters.
[Abdullah] The Bull says we need more hostages, let's go.
[Houssam] His leg is hurt, it's hard for him to walk.
[Rashid]
What happened?
[Abdullah] It's just a scratch.
Houssam, you go too.
[Houssam]
Take care.
Imran...
Keep an eye on the American, okay?
Alright, good.
[groans]
[groaning]
[sighs]
[dialing]
[man on phone]
Hello?
[Imran]
Father! Father, it's Imran.
Imran? Thank God. Thank God.
Jamilla!
Jamilla, it's your brother.
How's your training going, Imran?
Training is going well, Father.
Father, I called to say...
Father I love you so much,
I love you all so much...
We all love you very much.
Your mother misses you a lot.
You're making us all proud, my son.
Father, I wanted to ask, did they give you the money yet?
[father]
No, not yet my child.
No money yet.
But don't worry, these are very noble men of Allah.
Very good people.
[Imran] Father, make sure you get the money from them.
They swore it on the Holy Quran.
Father, give my love to Jamilla and Mother.
-Father.
-Imran?
-Father... Father... Father
-Imran, are you there? Imran?
- Imran?

[Arjun grunts]

[sirens wailing in distance]
[Zahra, thinking]
"My darling David.
As I write this letter,
I'm hoping you'll never have to read it.
That I get the chance to tell you these words in person.
You said to me when we first met,
'If you're feeling scared, just jump.
- You might fall, but you might just fly.'"
- [no audible dialogue]
"And you were right.
And we did.
I don't know what kind of crazy kismet made our worlds collide.
But if we worked, it was because of you and your patience with my family.
Your belief in us made me feel as if anything is possible.
Even now.
Even in this nightmare.
I know you'll raise our son to be the man that you are.
Please remind Cameron every day how much I love him.
And how much I love his father.
Forever.
Zahra."
Stop it. Stop it, Miss Kashani.
Miss Kashani, please stop. Stop.
- Open it.
- Please, come and sit here. Please.
I have to be with my family.
Open the door.
I know it's hard, but police are very near now.
No one's coming.
We've been here six hours.
Six hours for what?
No one's coming for us.
My baby's out there.
Please open the door.
[woman] She's right.
Open the door.
I want to go.
- Me too.
- Please, please.
We cannot evacuate everyone without being detected.
[Vasili] It's not everyone.
There are six people.
That's all.
We're going. Open the door.
Sir, if they hear us going, we will all die.
They know we are here.
If they come back, we all die.
If they bomb the building, we die.
If we leave, maybe we die.
We take our chances.
Open the fucking door.
Now.
[keys jangle]
Very well, sir.
- We'll be praying for you, sir.
- Yeah, fuck your prayers.
That's what started this shit.
Let's go.
Zahra!
Hey. This is stupid.
- Come. Let's go.
- I'm getting my baby.
[rapid gunfire]
Run.
[Rashid] Hey!
[in Punjabi]
Go that way.
Go that way!
Go that way!
Go back!
[Vasili] It's okay.
They won't kill us.
They want us alive. It's okay.
[Rashid, in Punjabi]
Hey!
Shut up and move.
[Brother]
Rashid, what's going on?
I got two more, Brother.
High rollers.
[Brother]
Good. Put them with the others.
Later, you'll line them up by the windows.
And blow their brains out for all the cameras below.
[door opens]
[Rashid speaks Punjabi]

[Abdullah, Rashid shouting]

Tie him up.
[whispers] Where's Cameron?
- [David whispers] You don't know me.
- [Vasili groaning]
Hands behind your back.
[yells in pain]
[Abdullah] Whoah. Gently, gently.
Just her hands...
[crying]
[breathing shakily]
She look local?
- [in English] Indian? Huh?
- [whimpers, sniffles]
[man] Animals.

No, no! No!
[crying]
[both laughing]
[mutters]
[crowd clamoring]
[man on TV] These images taken around 4:00 a.m. show the moment security forces and angry citizens confronted the two gunmen, beating them with sticks.
The gunmen had earlier hijacked a police van and are thought to have been behind the CST station attack.
Both men suffered multiple bullet wounds from which one died.
While the other,
Ajmal Kasab, is now in custody.
[officer, in Hindi]
Who is Brother Bull?
[in Hindi] You can do whatever you want to me.
I don't know.
Brother Bull...
..what did he ask you to do?
He said...
"You are Muslims."
"The infidels defraud you."
"They left you in poverty."
"They left you behind, as they went ahead."
"Go."
"Do Jihad."
"Go and do Jihad."
[Rashid singing in Punjabi]
[woman on TV] At the moment, there are still terrorists at loose in Mumbai.
The military seemed to have worked out that they are...
[explosion on TV]
[in Hindi]
Call him again.
[singing continues]
[singing continues]
What was your plan?
Where were you going next?
We were going to die.
[singing continues]
His phone is off.
[sobs]
[singing continues]
[Abdullah, in Punjabi] Houssam and
I were just outside. We're here now.
Yes, we already lit the fire.
[door locks]
Okay, I'll ask.
Oi.
What's your name?
What's your name?
[grunts]
What? What's your name?
Tell me! Speak!
- [Abdullah] What's your name?
- [in Russian] I don't understand.
[Abdullah]
What, asshole? What?
[Brother]
Abdullah...
[Abdullah]
Yes?
[Brother]
Ask him in English.
Ask him. "What is your name?"
What?
- [Brother, in English] What...
- [in English] What...
- ...is...
- ...is...
- ...your...
- ...your...
- ...name?
- ...name?
[in Punjabi]
Tell him.
[in English] I am nobody.
I am salesman. My name is Peter.
I'm nobody.
[Abdullah, in Punjabi]
Asshole.
I'm sorry Brother, I don't understand. It's a long name.
That's alright, Abdullah. Check his pockets, check his wallet.
Check everywhere, you will find something.
Okay, Brother.
Hold this.
Check his pockets.
[Vasili groans]
What's all this?
Yes sir, this is Houssam.
[Brother]
Yes Houssam?
[Houssam] We found his wallet and passport.
[Brother]
Send me a photo of it.
Just a second.
[Brother] Good, we will run a check on him.
Sending it now.
[in Russian]
Don't touch it.
[breathing heavily]
Fuck off!
[spits]
Fucking peasants.
- [Abdullah muttering]

You dog!
Spit on me!
Spit on me!
Just try, you dog!
Spit on me!
Spit on me!
You, stay down!
- [groaning]
- [gunmen shouting]
Heads down! Heads down!
- [Brother] Houssam?
- [Houssam] Yes?
What's that noise, what's happening?
Abdullah, he's gone mad!
He broke the Russian's ribs!
-Put the Russian on.
-Okay, Okay.
- Hey! Hey!
- [Vasili grunts]
Speak to him.
[Brother, in English]
Vasili Gordetsky?
[panting]
[in English] You know who I am.
- Vasili Gordetsky?
- What?
The president and co-founder of NV Capital.
Former officer in Soviet Special Forces.
So fucking what?
You want money? Hmm?
I can get you money.
Your money will not save you here.
You will die for what you did in Afghanistan.
Oh, for God's sake.
[laughs, wheezes]
You know what
I did in Afghanistan?
I fucked your mother!
I fuck your sister, you prick! I fu...
[groaning]
[Brother, in Punjabi]
Put Abdullah on.
Yes Brother?
What are you doing?!
He spat in my face, Okay?
Abdullah, calm down.
This is not the time to get angry.
These people are not important anymore.
CNN just showed that Special
Forces have landed in Mumbai.
You should be clear-headed about what to do next.
-Understand?
-Yeah...
-Yes, Brother!
-Yes! Yes, Brother Bull.
Abdullah...
It's time.
From Mumbai to Washington, let them hear their screams...
..as we've heard our Muslim brothers scream.
God is great, Brother.
Listen.
Brother is saying, it's time.
[in Arabic]
All praise to Allah!
[in Punjabi]
Imran, you stay here.
Keep an eye on them.
If anyone moves...
Anyone moves, you shoot them. Okay?
[spits]
[Vasili groans]
[Imran]
Stay down!
Stay down!
[door closes]
Don't you understand?!
Get down or I'll shoot you!
Please. Oh, no.
[grunts]
[Abdullah] Brother says we must light every corner of the hotel.
- [all clamoring]
- Stop! Stop! Please, please! Stop!
I work here.
Please go down this way.
Sir, please, they'll shoot you. Sir.
They'll shoot you. Please. This way.
Follow me. Follow me. Please.
Follow me, sir. Please, follow me.
Please follow me.
[all shout in Arabic]

[Oberoi] Please don't worry.
Sorry, sir. There was nowhere else to go.
They set fire to the hotel.
It's a baby.
