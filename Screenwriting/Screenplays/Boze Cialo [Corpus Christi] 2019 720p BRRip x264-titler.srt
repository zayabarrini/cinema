THIS FILM WAS CO-FINANCED BY

INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS

7
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,957
I'm gonna say it again.

8
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:17,665
Use the whole blade for cutting.

9
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,915
Cut at a right angle.

10
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,915
Keep working!

11
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,999
Hello?

12
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,082
Door!

13
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,540
Hold him!

14
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,457
Put his balls in the drawer!

15
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,957
Shut the fuck up!

16
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:32,290
PAIN / RAGE / VIOLENCE
LOVE / FAMILY

APOCALYPSE

18
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,749
You! Come with me.

19
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,624
- Where's the preacher?
- Father Tomasz is not here yet.

20
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,624
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

21
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,207
- The Lord be with you.
- And with your spirit.

22
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,124
Before we begin...

23
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,290
I'd like to tell you something.

24
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:56,332
I'm not here to pray mechanically.

25
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,040
And I hope you're not here,

26
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,707
either,
just to get it done with.

27
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,874
You don't have to stay here.

28
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,707
We can go outside and...
Wanna play football?

29
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,415
God will follow us.

30
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,582
If we don't have to be here...

31
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,999
Here.

32
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,665
Then ask yourselves:
"Why have we come here?"

33
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,790
We're here to remember
something important.

34
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,749
Remember and keep it in memory.

35
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,374
Each of us is the priest of Christ.

36
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,374
Me, you. Each and every one of you.

37
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,499
They tell you to pray.

38
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,499
What does "pray" mean?

39
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,999
It means: "Talk to God. "

40
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,082
Tell him something
important, personal.

41
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:50,457
Tell him about your feelings,
anger, fear, hurt...

42
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,415
Even about your guilt.

43
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,165
He will understand that.

44
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,665
Sing to him about it!

45
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,999
Daniel!

46
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:23,582
<i>The Lord is my shepherd...</i>

47
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:29,915
<i>I shall not want.</i>

48
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:35,749
<i>He makes me lie down
in green pastures.</i>

49
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:41,915
<i>He leads me beside still waters.</i>

50
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,540
<i>He makes me lie down
in green pastures.</i>

51
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,415
Shit, Bonus is here.

52
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,999
Fuck, that's Bonus...

53
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,207
What's up, Daniel?

54
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,290
Long time no see.

55
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,707
So, you're getting the fuck outta here
just when I came?

56
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,999
You think you can run away?

57
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,124
- You hear me?
- Bonus!

58
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,957
I'll find you anyway.

59
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,915
Move over there.

60
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,582
Fuck!

61
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,540
Get out! Get out!

62
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,832
Enough!

63
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,124
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with Thee...

64
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:58,247
CORPUS CHRISTI

65
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,624
I put my number in.

66
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,707
- Don't call me unless it's important.
- Thanks.

67
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,415
What time do you need to be
at the sawmill?

68
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,415
At 4 p.m.

69
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,832
That's the other end
of the country, right?

70
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,374
You afraid or what?

71
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,207
I just haven't been out there much.

72
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,874
Walkiewicz is a good man.

73
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,165
Demanding, but good.

74
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:43,582
Father, what if I took my finals?
Is it really impossible to...?

75
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,207
Do you remember
what I told you last year?

76
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,499
Yeah, I know.

77
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,707
No seminary accepts convicts like you.

78
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,332
Besides...

79
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:02,457
There are many other ways
to do good things in life.

80
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,582
Easier ways.

81
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,165
When you get there, you need to be...?

82
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,540
Sober, that's obvious.

83
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,082
You're gonna make it.

84
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,582
One!

85
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,832
Two!

86
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,207
Were you really in juvie?

87
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,749
What for?

88
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,790
Just... things.

89
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,082
Things?

90
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,957
You're a student, eh?

91
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,790
Of psychology.

92
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,665
Cool.

93
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,790
Yeah, it's cool.

94
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,707
Hard as fuck though.

95
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,040
Fuck me!

96
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,457
Daniel!

97
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,707
Saint Daniel!

98
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,665
Let me try it on.
What the fuck?

99
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,332
Put it out.

100
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,082
You hear me? Put it out.

101
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,249
Or what?

102
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,499
Or that.

103
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,707
Where are you going?

104
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,124
To work.

105
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,790
Work where?

106
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,915
The sawmill.

107
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,374
From a juvie, eh?

108
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,915
Released on parole.

109
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,207
Nah, the usual.

110
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,499
I can sense you anywhere, you scum.

111
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,874
Oi, 'scuse me!

112
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,915
- Was it the last Mass?
- Yes.

113
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,040
The next one is in the morning.

114
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,374
- Wait till morning. Great.
- If you actually care...

115
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,207
No place to sleep in the sawmill?

116
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,790
What sawmill?

117
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,874
Where are you from then?

118
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:32,290
Doesn't matter where you're coming from.
All that matters is where you are going.

119
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,165
Where are you going then?

120
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,999
Wherever the wind takes me I settle.

121
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,832
So you're from the sawmill.

122
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,957
The church closes soon.

123
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,207
I'm a priest.

124
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,040
And I'm a nun.

125
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,832
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

126
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,749
Where's your clergy collar?

127
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,540
So I'll...

128
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,207
I'll introduce you.

129
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,749
Wait here, Father.

130
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,082
Give me that!

131
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,832
- I waited for you the whole Mass. - You
should've come inside and participated.

132
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,957
- The church's door wasn't shut.
- I'm not that fucking mad yet.

133
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,040
- God bless you.
- God bless you.

134
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,999
The vicar will be happy to meet you.

135
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,499
Your civilian clothes, Father...

136
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,624
- You can change in the sacristy.
- All right.

137
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,040
Fuck.

138
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,249
Quiet.

139
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,332
It's a friend.

140
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,790
Don't you recognize a friend?

141
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,957
Blessed be God. I'm Wojciech Golab.

142
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,040
Father Tomasz.

143
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,249
Can you help me, Father?

144
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,249
I need to pay the bills tomorrow.

145
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:39,249
Sort it by denomination into tens.

146
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:48,082
So? A pilgrimage from parish
to parish, eh?

147
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,499
Kind of.

148
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,374
- You've been ordained recently?
- Uh-huh.

149
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,707
Which seminary?

150
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,374
Father! Can we talk for a second?

151
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,082
My dear, Father is in a meeting now.

152
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,249
- So...
- I'm sorry...

153
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,124
Which one?

154
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,457
In Warsaw.

155
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:21,624
The Metropolitan Seminary
or the one in the Praga district?

156
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,499
The one in Praga.

157
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,582
I graduated
from the Metropolitan Seminary.

158
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,957
The regime was oppressive.

159
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:40,499
Anyway, you can't remember it.
It was a long time ago.

160
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:45,249
Your seminary was strict.
But we used to bunk off

161
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,624
and spend nights out.

162
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,374
What about you?

163
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,665
Really strict.

164
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,374
But...

165
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,040
At times, did you manage to...

166
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,374
...escape?

167
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,457
Some guys do bunk off.

168
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,624
But they return in the morning?

169
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,207
How's the parish?

170
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:23,207
Just the usual.
Many people, few believers.

171
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,457
Some go to church only to keep up
appearances with their neighbors.

172
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,874
I saw the board with photos.

173
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,082
It was a tragedy.

174
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,915
I've got something for you, Father.

175
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,207
Quince liqueur.

176
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,624
And you, Father?

177
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,624
Bad for my health.

178
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,540
So, cheers!

179
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:25,499
It's getting late.
If you want, Father, you can stay here.

180
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,082
For the night.

181
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,999
Anything else?

182
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,124
Cigarettes.

183
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,165
Which ones?

184
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,665
Don't know. Strong.

185
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,165
These, please.

186
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,415
Blessed be God!

187
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,749
Forever and ever.

188
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,290
Look at that kid...

189
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,165
...Eternal rest grant to them, O Lord,

190
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,499
And let light perpetual
shine upon them.

191
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,915
Eternal rest grant to them...

192
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:55,915
FATHER TOMASZ

193
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,749
Father!

194
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,249
Father!

195
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,040
Hello?

196
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,374
Are you asleep?

197
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,790
Great.

198
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,457
Morning.

199
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,499
Blessed be God.

200
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:27,207
- Nnnoo...
- Quiet!

201
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,165
And up into bed!

202
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,249
And now...

203
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,749
Can you...?

204
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:45,165
- Father likes to have a drink, eh?
- He doesn't drink.

205
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:50,124
Shall I cancel
the confession session or what?

206
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,332
There are people waiting.

207
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,207
God bless you!

208
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,249
God bless you!

209
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:14,332
Please, come inside!

210
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,665
Please, come inside.

211
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,040
Come on!

212
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:49,582
Blessed be God.

213
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,415
Forever and ever. Amen.

214
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:54,957
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

215
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,415
A GUIDE FOR CONFESSION

216
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:03,374
May the Lord be on your lips
and in your heart that you may...

217
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,124
...properly confess all your sins.

218
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:11,832
It has been three weeks
since my last confession.

219
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:13,499
I've done my penance.

220
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,832
These are my sins.

221
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:23,707
I can't stand it when...

222
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,790
My youngest son... He's twelve.

223
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:33,249
He smokes cigarettes
with his friends at school.

224
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,332
I try to talk to him.

225
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,499
But it's not working.

226
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:46,040
I sometimes get impatient...

227
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,415
I hit my son.

228
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:57,332
What penance
do you have for me, Father?

229
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:03,457
As for cigarettes, it's easy.

230
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,749
There's a well-tried method.

231
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:13,749
Buy a pack of strong cigarettes.

232
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:17,040
And tell him to smoke them.
He'll quit at once.

233
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:19,707
Shall I buy him cigarettes?

234
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:22,332
Uh-huh. Or give him yours.

235
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,832
But I... I don't smoke.

236
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,540
I can smell it.

237
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:35,540
Well, yes, but it's only...

238
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,999
Sometimes.

239
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,207
Do you hit your son
only sometimes or more often?

240
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:53,915
Sometimes.

241
00:27:57,708 --> 00:28:01,624
So, as your penance...

242
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:06,415
Take your son biking.

243
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,499
Thank you.

244
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,874
Thanks be to God.

245
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,540
Here you are.

246
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:50,457
Once I committed a mortal sin.

247
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:58,665
I made my confession, but...

248
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:04,665
Confession solves nothing.

249
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,582
Do you understand me, Father?

250
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,540
I guess so.

251
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:31,540
I'm asking myself
who could replace me.

252
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:39,665
No... I don't think it's a good idea.

253
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:41,957
Just for a few days.

254
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:46,915
Until I find out
what the treatment is.

255
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:53,874
It's going to stay between you and me.
The Curia won't know anything.

256
00:29:56,708 --> 00:30:00,582
- You mean, like, Masses and all?
- Yes.

257
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,124
And much more.

258
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:16,665
Just for a few days.

259
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,582
Hold it for me.

260
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,040
Don't enter the vicar's room.

261
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:40,040
Why should he stay in this hole
if the vicar's room is free?

262
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:42,499
Because that room
belongs to the vicar.

263
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:48,999
The Mass is at eight!

264
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,415
But you know that, don't you?

265
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,332
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son...

266
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:48,624
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

267
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:57,199
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and the love of God,

268
00:32:57,625 --> 00:33:02,082
and the communion of the Holy Spirit
be with you all.

269
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,290
And with your spirit.

270
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:28,290
Silence can also be a prayer.

271
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:45,957
I'm not here to pray mechanically.

272
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:49,665
And neither are you, I hope.

273
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:54,749
Actually, God is also outside, right?

274
00:33:57,208 --> 00:34:00,290
Because why are we here anyway?

275
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,082
It's like this.

276
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:13,707
We come to church.

277
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:21,165
We look at him.

278
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:25,749
Jesus, how can I imitate you?

279
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,540
You are so pure.

280
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:34,665
While I bring you
all this dirt with me.

281
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,540
How am I supposed to act
on your behalf

282
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:41,040
if I can't handle my own life?

283
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:55,874
Then go and pray.

284
00:34:57,333 --> 00:35:00,540
Just pray.
From the bottom of your heart.

285
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:03,790
Now.

286
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:06,415
Have a chat with God.

287
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,290
Sing him a song.

288
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:28,099
<i>The Lord is my shepherd.</i>

289
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:35,115
<i>I shall not want.</i>

290
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:42,040
<i>He makes me lie down
in green pastures.</i>

291
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:49,040
<i>He leads me beside still waters.</i>

292
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:56,365
<i>He makes me lie down
in green pastures.</i>

293
00:35:57,666 --> 00:36:00,393
<i>He leads me</i>

294
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:05,122
<i>beside still waters.</i>

295
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:28,499
Good evening!

296
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:58,040
Leave that!

297
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:02,707
He's here... Shh.

298
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,749
God bless you.

299
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:13,624
- Shall I take my shoes off?
- Please, don't, Father...

300
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,957
- Hello.
- Hi.

301
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,249
Please, come in.

302
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,290
Turn it off.

303
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:41,415
No, this is good.
You've got a beautiful voice.

304
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,499
- Why don't you sing in church?
- Yeah, right.

305
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,040
You can see at once
it was filmed by Kuba.

306
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,332
He added his special effects.

307
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:54,165
Everything shakes.

308
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,290
Kuba is...

309
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:11,790
it was God's plan.

310
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:15,040
God planned to kill seven people?

311
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:21,249
I'll bring the cake.

312
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:29,124
Seven? So why are there
six photos on the board?

313
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,207
It was a head-on collision.

314
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:34,957
Kuba and our friends were in one car.

315
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:36,915
In the other, there was only a driver.

316
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:39,082
The driver?

317
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:41,790
Why isn't his photo on the board?

318
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,957
The vicar said no.

319
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,082
He had the right
to take such a decision.

320
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:04,707
God will manage.

321
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:17,790
Fuck...

322
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,874
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with Thee.

323
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,290
Blessed art thou amongst women,

324
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:45,957
and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb, Jesus.

325
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,790
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

326
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:52,832
now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

327
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:56,040
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with Thee...

328
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:58,665
Excuse me, may I?

329
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:00,707
Of course.

330
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:08,665
Lord...

331
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:12,290
You took them away from us.

332
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:16,207
Kuba, Marysia, Tomek...

333
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:21,040
Maciek, Kamila...

334
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:24,957
and Staszek...

335
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:27,707
What you did was unfair.

336
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:31,082
Cruel.

337
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:33,332
Stupid.

338
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,957
We don't understand why you did that.

339
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:39,624
We are furious.

340
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,665
Try to understand us.

341
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,999
Don't judge, but understand us.

342
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:51,665
And help us, O Lord.

343
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:54,707
Help us understand.

344
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,582
Help us understand you!

345
00:40:56,708 --> 00:41:00,749
For we know
how easy it is to lose faith.

346
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:06,457
Not only in God and his goodness.

347
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:10,165
But in the point of it all.

348
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,165
We know!

349
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:15,582
Just take a look!

350
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:18,082
This is a miracle.

351
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:20,624
This is the Kingdom of Heaven
on Earth.

352
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,332
The one we're reading
so much about in the Gospel.

353
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:26,332
It's not up there,
distant in time and space.

354
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:28,624
It's right here, right now!

355
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:46,707
All right!

356
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:02,957
Now we should hang it to dry.

357
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,707
Holy water doesn't make
clothes dirty, Ms. Lidia.

358
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:09,207
But it makes them rot.

359
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,582
Father Golab called me.

360
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:17,665
He has to stay there a little longer.

361
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:21,124
- Why?
- For electrical stimulation.

362
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,749
- What stimulation?
- Of his neck.

363
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:28,457
- And they do it over there?
- Will you stay longer, Father?

364
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:11,999
- Hello.
- God bless you.

365
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:14,374
Please, come inside.

366
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:31,540
Bartus...

367
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:33,874
Come here, son.

368
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:37,540
You will not die.

369
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:28,457
Take the kids away.

370
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:49,999
That's almost forty euros. Get it?

371
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:51,915
For an hour's work.

372
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,915
And the best part...
The sunshine is free of charge.

373
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:58,499
The sun is strong and tans your ass.

374
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:00,790
You stand like this...

375
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:12,999
Good morning.

376
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:27,790
Let's close our eyes
and hold out our hands towards them.

377
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:31,124
Maybe they feel our presence.
Maybe they hear us.

378
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,707
Maybe they also miss us

379
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,790
and need a hug.

380
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:39,207
It's in our hearts.
Let's reach out to them.

381
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:41,499
Inhale...

382
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:43,624
Exhale...

383
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:46,790
Exhale...

384
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:48,749
Inhale... And let it all out!

385
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,957
Once again!

386
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:56,832
Let's reach out.

387
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:57,999
Inhale. Exhale.

388
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:00,832
Let's reach out to the place
where no prayer can get.

389
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:03,499
Where no thought can get.

390
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:05,624
Inhale. Exhale.

391
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:08,915
Take a deep breath and let it all out.

392
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:14,624
Inhale! Inhale.

393
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,415
Inhale! And exhale!
Because we miss them.

394
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:20,832
Let's reach out to what's choking us.

395
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:23,707
To what stops us
from shouting and crying.

396
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:26,040
Turn around and let it out!

397
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:29,457
You whore!

398
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:31,374
You whore!

399
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,582
You whore!

400
00:47:33,708 --> 00:47:36,082
You whore!

401
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:37,999
You whore!

402
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:39,999
You whore...

403
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:42,582
You whore...

404
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:43,915
You whore...

405
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:47,249
it somehow feels shameful.

406
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:49,915
Why? Who's going to think
it's shameful?

407
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:52,249
They are?

408
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:58,082
They are not ashamed of you for sure!

409
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,290
Right?

410
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:44,749
Is the priest in?

411
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:45,999
God bless you!

412
00:48:58,541 --> 00:49:01,624
Well, of course.
We haven't had the pleasure...

413
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:05,290
Walkiewicz.
I'm the mayor.

414
00:49:05,416 --> 00:49:07,874
- Father Tomasz.
- God bless you.

415
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:19,374
I haven't got this much
during my entire term.

416
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,124
For your collection.

417
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,582
It kind of grew.

418
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,624
Sorry.

419
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:36,582
Ms. Lidia told me
a few things about you, Father.

420
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:40,790
- Did she?
- She did.

421
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,707
I know everything.

422
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:58,332
Have you heard
of the sawmill near the town?

423
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:01,874
I guess I have.

424
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,124
Well, it's mine.

425
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,999
Near the hill.
No?

426
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:11,999
Yes?

427
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:16,040
Yes? OK, never mind.

428
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:19,457
I'm going to open a new wing
before the Feast of Corpus Christi.

429
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:23,207
The vicar and I
had already talked about it.

430
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,582
But in this situation...

431
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:32,582
if you agreed to replace the vicar
at the celebration,

432
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:35,124
I know how to show my appreciation.

433
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:39,707
No problem.

434
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:42,332
God bless you.

435
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,082
God bless you!

436
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,665
Chill. Just ignore me.

437
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:19,040
Relax. I invited him.

438
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,540
How's it going?

439
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,457
What? That's a regular topic
out there.

440
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,040
Everyone should handle it
on their own. Don't know.

441
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:38,040
All right.
And how do you handle temptation

442
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:40,749
as a priest, Father?

443
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,332
You know...

444
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:48,415
- Things happen.
- What then?

445
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:50,999
To be honest, celibacy is pointless.

446
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:54,582
Once, a pope came up with this idea
and now it's a problem.

447
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:58,040
But God had a kid
and no one gets at him.

448
00:51:58,166 --> 00:52:01,832
Wow, I'm impressed. I guess
we have a candidate for a new pope here!

449
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:04,582
Nah, but seriously...

450
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:07,999
Rules are rules.

451
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,082
They have a point.

452
00:52:10,916 --> 00:52:12,540
If you're in, do it right.

453
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:16,624
If you decide to become a priest,
you just go for it.

454
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:20,249
I think I could manage too
if I really got into it.

455
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:22,290
Flying solo, from time to time...

456
00:52:22,416 --> 00:52:25,249
Yeah, right. You can't stand
even one day without porn.

457
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,332
You'd be fucking surprised.

458
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:30,082
You remember Maciek's collection?

459
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:32,707
Shit! He was the porn king.

460
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,082
Outstanding items.

461
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:35,874
Was?

462
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:42,040
He also died in that accident.

463
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:43,832
He didn't die. He was murdered.

464
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:45,415
Fuck me...

465
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:46,915
By that driver...

466
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:49,832
if the fucker wasn't dead,
he'd get a life sentence.

467
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,457
I'd fucking kill him myself instead.

468
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:55,832
- He was fucking nuts.
- Full of shit.

469
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:58,665
The crazy motherfucker didn't drink,
but who the fuck knows?

470
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:01,832
Driving drunk as fuck,
he got into

471
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,499
the other lane, and bam!

472
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:06,207
Oh yeah? How do you know that?

473
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:09,934
- What do you mean?
- How do you know that?

474
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:13,165
- You're gonna defend him now?
- I'm not!

475
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,290
We don't know what the fuck happened.

476
00:53:15,416 --> 00:53:19,207
We know the police found him drunk.

477
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:21,207
Wow, now you believe the police?

478
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:23,624
Sure, keep pissing on me.

479
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,332
I'm not. It's just...

480
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:27,540
There were six people in one car, man!

481
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:30,207
Six or five,
what difference does it make, huh?

482
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:34,249
The fact is he used to yell at people.

483
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:37,290
How many times did he threaten
to fucking kill someone?

484
00:53:37,416 --> 00:53:39,642
- And he finally did.
- Yep, he just came up with this idea.

485
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:42,874
"I'm gonna fucking kill
someone today!"

486
00:53:43,958 --> 00:53:47,832
Luckily, they didn't bury him here,
but in some dump.

487
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:51,499
- Why?
- 'Cos he wasn't a local.

488
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:55,415
Bullshit!
He went to school with my old man.

489
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:57,499
Fuck me...

490
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:00,832
The vicar refused to bury him here.

491
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:02,624
The widow had to take him away.

492
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,957
So fucking good for her.

493
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:07,290
And what was she guilty of,
for fuck's sake?

494
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:09,249
You'd better stop talking, eh?

495
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:10,207
Why should I?

496
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:11,874
- Why?
- Yeah, why?

497
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:15,124
Where were you
when your brother was being buried?

498
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:18,624
Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

499
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:19,934
- What did you do back then?
- I'm surprised, really.

500
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:22,374
- Why, huh?
- I lost my sis,

501
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,142
you lost your brother!
You didn't even come to his funeral!

502
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:26,124
You have no right to talk now!

503
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,582
It's not your fucking business!

504
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:31,457
Chill the fuck out, y'all!
Why remember what happened last year?

505
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:34,665
Why the fuck analyze this crazy shit?

506
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:37,915
Let's have fun, play some music,
for fuck's sake...

507
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:40,207
So that's what it's all about, Father.

508
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:00,749
What? It's nothing
but nature from God.

509
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:12,540
You think I've always been a priest?

510
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:16,124
What did you do before?

511
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:21,957
Everything.

512
00:55:23,291 --> 00:55:25,124
Like what?

513
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:31,040
Everything. I had a lot of fun.

514
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,415
Kuba would have liked you.

515
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:43,415
And I didn't even come to his funeral.

516
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:45,957
Why?

517
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:48,957
I got high as a kite.

518
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:56,707
Everyone does the best they can.

519
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:59,790
- Or they don't.
- Right.

520
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:04,707
I still do better than my mates.

521
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:07,249
Not to mention the widow.

522
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:10,707
Her husband was the driver
from the other car.

523
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:14,665
She's withdrawn, literally gone.

524
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,124
She doesn't talk to anyone.

525
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,249
And no one tried?

526
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:26,582
- She will talk to me.
- Yeah, right.

527
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:32,124
Wanna bet?

528
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:45,707
What?!

529
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:47,249
God bless you...

530
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:48,874
I won't give it back.

531
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,207
You can fucking kill me, but I won't.

532
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:53,749
I don't understand.

533
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:56,082
Fuck off!

534
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:12,082
Why are you laughing?

535
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:18,624
YOU WHORE

536
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:50,499
I've heard you're asking around
about that driver, Father.

537
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:53,249
Hi!

538
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:57,165
Don't wait for me.
I'll have a smoke with Father.

539
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:10,207
I can understand your curiosity.

540
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:12,749
But the investigation is over.

541
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,499
We've only managed
to calm down unnecessary emotions.

542
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,540
What's the point of going back?

543
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,540
Father, I'm asking you to...

544
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:37,540
To let this thing go.

545
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,249
I have the impression
that you're giving me an order.

546
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:48,790
Have some humility.
You're a substitute, Father.

547
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:53,290
Well, I mean...

548
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,499
I have the right to talk
to the faithful about anything I want.

549
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:05,499
And I can share my opinion
about you, Father.

550
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,749
With the Bishop.

551
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:18,165
You know...

552
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:22,415
You might have power.

553
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:24,374
But I'm the one who's right.

554
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:27,707
You might be right.

555
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,749
But I'm the one who has power.

556
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,457
So? We have a deal?

557
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,624
Make a funny face to cheer her up!

558
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:51,915
What's wrong? Why's she crying?

559
01:00:04,791 --> 01:00:06,999
Thank you all for coming.

560
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,832
As the owner,
I'd like to thank my manager.

561
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:13,374
Applause.

562
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:18,082
And the CEO of Budexpert

563
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:20,874
for coming here today.

564
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,207
Now I'd like to ask Father Tomasz
to bless the new wing.

565
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:34,457
Just a short prayer.

566
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:41,165
Our Father...

567
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:46,915
Today, we want to admit to being ill.

568
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:50,582
This illness is greed.

569
01:00:51,416 --> 01:00:55,915
We must have more money,
more expensive clothes...

570
01:00:56,041 --> 01:00:58,082
More cars...

571
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:02,082
More people we want to control.

572
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,540
Therefore, O Lord,
we drop down on our knees,

573
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:14,832
unashamed of being small.

574
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:30,624
Our Father...

575
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:33,374
I admit that I'm guilty.

576
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,540
I want to be important. To be liked.

577
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:38,624
To be admired.

578
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:41,582
To be in the spotlight.

579
01:01:41,708 --> 01:01:45,124
Not only to have more,
but to have more than others.

580
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,499
God, forgive me.

581
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:52,165
For constant trying to find
someone worse than myself.

582
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:56,415
Help me follow your example.

583
01:01:58,583 --> 01:02:00,999
Help me become humble.

584
01:02:05,833 --> 01:02:10,665
And now I'd like to bless
the new wing of the sawmill.

585
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:24,457
The last workshop is the largest one.

586
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:30,499
Three times more people work here
than elsewhere in the sawmill.

587
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:33,040
How many hours per day do they work?

588
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,082
It depends. 24/7, if necessary.

589
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:39,915
Look, the entire world
is waiting for our planks.

590
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:42,749
They are transported to the UK...

591
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:47,457
A beautiful sermon, Father.
Can we talk for a minute?

592
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:49,457
The Feast of Corpus Christi is coming.

593
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:51,499
Could we discuss the details?

594
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,165
Talk to Ms. Lidia, please.

595
01:02:58,291 --> 01:03:01,040
- I'd ask her opinion anyway.
- Fine, thank you.

596
01:03:01,666 --> 01:03:03,957
Six heads!

597
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:05,957
Watch your fingers.

598
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,832
Let me take it... It's fragile.

599
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:05,832
It was in his room.

600
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:09,707
- With autographs.
- That's David Beckham's.

601
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:28,415
It's still so hard.

602
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:34,540
God, it's so hard.

603
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,290
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

604
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:42,415
That's fine.

605
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,749
What are you going to do
with these things?

606
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,999
I'll burn them by the river.

607
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,582
The guys and I will take them
to a children's home.

608
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:51,790
That's Maciek. He was driving.

609
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:57,624
Kuba sent it to me
three hours before...

610
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:00,874
I'd like to say hello to my mum!

611
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,707
See you in church tomorrow!

612
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:07,040
Amen!

613
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,165
The tests didn't show anything.

614
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:15,040
Standard tests never do.

615
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:23,499
- God bless you!
- God bless you!

616
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:25,624
We'd like to talk to you, Father.

617
01:06:26,541 --> 01:06:29,540
I'm coming! Please take a seat.

618
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:31,832
Girls, sit down.

619
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:42,374
What about the widow?

620
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:16,749
Can we...?

621
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:26,999
Did your mum send you?

622
01:07:28,208 --> 01:07:30,665
Mum doesn't know I'm here.

623
01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:38,457
You want something
I have left of Slawek?

624
01:07:57,708 --> 01:07:59,582
Here you go.

625
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:21,790
Read it aloud.

626
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:30,124
"My dearest... "

627
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:34,249
"... daughter was murdered... "

628
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:36,707
"... by your... "

629
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:40,790
"... fucked-up husband. "

630
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:54,749
"How could you let
your drunk husband drive?"

631
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:57,499
"You must have known. "

632
01:08:57,625 --> 01:09:01,749
"it was you who made him
drunk as fuck. "

633
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:06,790
"We all know what white trash
you both were. "

634
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:09,332
He'd been sober for four years.

635
01:09:10,291 --> 01:09:13,040
The autopsy showed nothing.

636
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:19,374
My mother wrote this one.

637
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:23,332
This is her handwriting.

638
01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:48,124
Did the vicar know about it?

639
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,582
The vicar?

640
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:53,540
He promised he'd bury Slawek

641
01:09:53,666 --> 01:09:55,957
once things calmed down.

642
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,957
What do you mean?

643
01:10:46,541 --> 01:10:48,124
Amen.

644
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:03,499
I don't remember what to say
at the beginning.

645
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:07,165
Don't worry about that. Shoot.

646
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,207
I have sinned a lot.

647
01:11:13,916 --> 01:11:18,457
I used to rob newsagent's shops
and stores.

648
01:11:18,583 --> 01:11:20,999
I did drugs.

649
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:27,457
Once I wanted to show off
in front of my people,

650
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:30,207
so I beat the shit out of one fucker
and he fucking collapsed.

651
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:33,415
He dropped dead in hospital.

652
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:36,749
I didn't plan that,
but it kind of happened.

653
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,999
So I ended up in juvie.

654
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:42,915
There, I hooked up with the priest
to have it easier.

655
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:46,832
When I fucking found out
that the brother of the guy I killed

656
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:51,249
was coming to juvie,
I begged the priest for parole.

657
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:54,665
I was going to work in the sawmill,
but I fucked out of there.

658
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:57,374
I got into a fucking dress and...

659
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,207
- Shut the fuck up!
- You shut the fuck up!

660
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:05,749
What the fuck do you want, Pinscher?

661
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:08,249
Not "what", but "how much".

662
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,874
Five grand.

663
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:21,290
- Where the fuck should I find it?
- In your fucking ass!

664
01:12:21,416 --> 01:12:25,082
You wanna go back to fucking juvie?

665
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:28,249
Bonus is so fucking ready
to get at you.

666
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:30,374
I wouldn't go back there, man.

667
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,665
I wouldn't even think about it.

668
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:35,582
I bet you're gonna end up
fucking dead.

669
01:13:08,833 --> 01:13:10,582
Bless you for that.

670
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:16,582
Bless you for that.

671
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:20,165
Bless you for that.

672
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:09,082
I am a murderer.

673
01:14:16,291 --> 01:14:19,207
Yes, you've heard me right. I killed.

674
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:25,040
I killed in my thoughts.

675
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:29,415
I killed in what...

676
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:31,707
...I failed to do.

677
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:37,332
I killed in what I did.

678
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:43,332
You know what we're good at?

679
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:48,540
Giving up on people.

680
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,749
Pointing the finger at them.

681
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:09,874
"Forgive" doesn't mean "forget".

682
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:16,124
It doesn't mean
"pretend nothing happened".

683
01:15:22,166 --> 01:15:24,415
"Forgive" means "love".

684
01:15:27,625 --> 01:15:30,415
Love someone despite their guilt.

685
01:15:31,875 --> 01:15:34,457
No matter what the guilt is.

686
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:44,415
Pray, brothers and sisters,
that my sacrifice and yours

687
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:48,499
may be acceptable to God,
the almighty Father.

688
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:52,040
May the Lord accept
the sacrifice at your hands

689
01:15:52,166 --> 01:15:55,040
for the praise and glory of his name,

690
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:59,832
for our good
and the good of all his holy Church.

691
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:05,707
<i>Across the lake</i>

692
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:13,332
<i>stands a green linden tree.</i>

693
01:17:15,375 --> 01:17:18,707
<i>And in the greenery</i>

694
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:22,207
<i>of this linden tree,</i>

695
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:28,999
<i>three little birds are singing.</i>

696
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:36,582
<i>They are not really birds,</i>

697
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:44,457
<i>but three brothers</i>

698
01:17:45,625 --> 01:17:48,749
<i>who say honey words</i>

699
01:17:48,875 --> 01:17:52,582
<i>to win one girl's favors</i>

700
01:17:52,708 --> 01:17:57,624
<i>and make her only his.</i>

701
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:04,957
<i>One says: "You are mine. "</i>

702
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:12,665
<i>The other says: "If God gives a sign. "</i>

703
01:18:14,208 --> 01:18:17,332
<i>And the third one says:</i>

704
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:20,797
<i>My dearest</i>

705
01:18:21,102 --> 01:18:26,152
<i>Why are you so sad?</i>

706
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,415
<i>How can I not be sad</i>

707
01:18:34,541 --> 01:18:38,137
<i>When they tell me</i>

708
01:18:38,729 --> 01:18:41,689
<i>to marry an old lad?</i>

709
01:18:42,416 --> 01:18:47,415
<i>We don't have much time,</i>

710
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:51,124
<i>only two Sundays</i>

711
01:18:51,708 --> 01:18:54,321
<i>I can spend</i>

712
01:18:54,404 --> 01:18:58,734
<i>with you, my love.</i>

713
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:17,707
Bravo, Father!

714
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:20,332
God bless you!

715
01:19:20,875 --> 01:19:22,915
One more thing.

716
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:30,957
The money raised during today's Mass
will be entirely spent

717
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:34,874
on the funeral of Slawek Kobielski,

718
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,582
who hasn't been buried until now.

719
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:42,249
The ceremony will take place here,
at our parish cemetery.

720
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:58,665
What's up, bitch?

721
01:20:01,708 --> 01:20:04,707
That's some sick bullshit you said
about the funeral...

722
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,624
Fuck me!

723
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:10,874
You shithead! Look at that!

724
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,332
Living fucking large, eh?

725
01:20:16,916 --> 01:20:18,999
Don't touch this.

726
01:20:19,125 --> 01:20:21,207
Don't!

727
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:24,374
Now I know why you're doing this.

728
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,540
You don't know shit.
Gotta bury that guy.

729
01:20:26,666 --> 01:20:29,207
Bury him in your fucking ass.

730
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,374
Give me the fucking dough.

731
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:34,207
No way.

732
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:38,915
You want me to smash it all
to fucking pieces?! A fucking faker.

733
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:44,374
Fuck me...

734
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,540
How many inches?

735
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:49,915
Fuck the money, I'ma take this shit.

736
01:20:53,833 --> 01:20:56,999
Shit, all right, I'll leave it now.

737
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,999
Bring the fucking glasses!

738
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:03,415
Let's have a drink and chat...

739
01:21:04,416 --> 01:21:07,082
Go and fucking get them, boy!

740
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,457
This thing after the reading.

741
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:16,457
It's all in the book.

742
01:21:16,583 --> 01:21:19,374
I know, for fuck's sake.
After the reading.

743
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,332
- The sermon?
- Yeah!

744
01:21:21,458 --> 01:21:25,207
- Is it freestyle or prepared?
- It's mine.

745
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:30,790
Was it that fucking lame?

746
01:21:30,916 --> 01:21:33,124
Nah, it fucking destroyed me.

747
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:37,415
You know what to say,
people follow you.

748
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:41,457
You know what to do.

749
01:21:41,958 --> 01:21:44,082
I used to serve at Mass in juvie.

750
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:46,540
But it's fucking different.

751
01:21:46,666 --> 01:21:49,207
The point is, you have it in you.

752
01:21:54,291 --> 01:21:56,624
What do I have?

753
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:01,040
Should I go back to juvie?

754
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:08,874
Work on fucking planks
till the end of my fucking life?

755
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:19,457
Give a fucking plank to my kid
for his birthday? Fuck...

756
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:21,915
You got a kid?

757
01:22:22,041 --> 01:22:24,249
Yeah, shit...

758
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:27,999
You love her?

759
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:30,415
I do.

760
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:32,415
I love her.

761
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:41,499
Please, for fuck's sake.
Give me the money.

762
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:43,874
It's not mine, man. Not mine.

763
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,665
Give me the dough.
That's not for me.

764
01:22:49,916 --> 01:22:52,165
I can't. It's for the funeral, man.

765
01:22:52,291 --> 01:22:54,332
All right! Fuck it.

766
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:58,499
You're fucked up, know that?

767
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,040
You poured all your potential
down the drain.

768
01:23:10,916 --> 01:23:12,749
You're stiff in the head,
looking so dead.

769
01:23:12,875 --> 01:23:14,351
Your every move has led to the grave.

770
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:16,957
Miracles fled, lies are spread.

771
01:23:17,083 --> 01:23:19,124
Everything I do I do for my brothers!

772
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:23,415
How did he announce it anyway?
Like a rock'n'roll star.

773
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:27,124
- It's our money after all.
- No respect even for...

774
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:30,665
God bless you!

775
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:36,290
We'd like to talk.

776
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:40,082
Let's talk.

777
01:23:45,833 --> 01:23:48,999
We don't agree to this funeral.

778
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:51,207
It's not proper.

779
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:53,457
Not proper to bury a man
in sacred ground?

780
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:55,915
- Not this man.
- Exactly.

781
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:58,707
We want our opinion to be respected.

782
01:24:00,458 --> 01:24:02,374
This is a good town.

783
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,457
With good people.

784
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:34,582
Please read it.

785
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:41,790
Please read it.

786
01:24:41,916 --> 01:24:43,874
Here you are.

787
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,790
Do you recognize any handwriting?

788
01:25:37,625 --> 01:25:39,957
What do you need
such provocations for?

789
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:43,749
You got a clergy collar
so you think you're a fighter?

790
01:25:43,875 --> 01:25:46,707
- Let me go.
- Why are you fucking things up?!

791
01:26:13,708 --> 01:26:16,124
Can I stay here?

792
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:24,665
Blessed be God!

793
01:28:25,958 --> 01:28:28,457
- Officer Baniocha.
- Father Tomasz.

794
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:30,290
We've met before, haven't we?

795
01:28:30,416 --> 01:28:33,582
I've never seen you in church.

796
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:35,999
But I have seen you, Father.

797
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:38,624
Not here, in the parish,
but somewhere else.

798
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:40,832
No, I'm from Warsaw.

799
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:44,915
Are you? Which parish?

800
01:28:47,875 --> 01:28:50,332
Our Lady... of Fatima.

801
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:53,165
You noted it down?

802
01:28:54,708 --> 01:28:58,207
Did you ask Father
for a priest ID card?

803
01:29:00,083 --> 01:29:02,040
Do you have an ID card, Father?

804
01:29:04,458 --> 01:29:06,999
That's my fault.

805
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:08,749
Yesterday, I washed Father's trousers

806
01:29:08,875 --> 01:29:10,915
with his wallet and ID.

807
01:29:11,041 --> 01:29:12,707
I'll bring it later on.

808
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:14,165
Hi...

809
01:29:14,291 --> 01:29:16,124
That's fine.

810
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:19,832
We just have to watch out
for the scum hanging around.

811
01:29:20,416 --> 01:29:22,665
Give us a moment.

812
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:37,582
How should we report it?

813
01:29:37,708 --> 01:29:40,124
An accidental fire?

814
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:43,457
Arson?
Or something else?

815
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:46,124
What does it depend on?

816
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:50,957
On you, I think.

817
01:29:57,666 --> 01:30:01,624
Since we've managed to meet here,

818
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:05,582
then we should be able to find

819
01:30:05,708 --> 01:30:08,165
a reasonable compromise, right?

820
01:30:08,291 --> 01:30:09,499
Right.

821
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:12,040
Do you agree with me, Ms. Ewa?

822
01:30:18,708 --> 01:30:20,999
I believe

823
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:26,040
Slawek's funeral
should take place in his hometown.

824
01:30:27,291 --> 01:30:31,665
But, in return for that,
we'll add his photo to our board.

825
01:30:32,083 --> 01:30:35,082
No, no! His photo can't be
pinned to our board.

826
01:30:35,875 --> 01:30:37,540
Not with our children.

827
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:40,082
His photo has to hang with the others.

828
01:30:40,208 --> 01:30:42,832
No, we can't agree to this.

829
01:30:43,666 --> 01:30:48,665
Let's remember what we talked about
over the phone yesterday.

830
01:30:48,791 --> 01:30:51,624
We agreed that in the meeting today

831
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:54,332
we'd try to resolve the conflict.

832
01:30:54,458 --> 01:30:57,499
This is the most important thing now.

833
01:30:57,625 --> 01:30:59,124
- The funeral will be here.
- No.

834
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:02,665
Change your tone.
Help to calm emotions down.

835
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:04,624
- A priest should...
- ... help!

836
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:08,349
- ... and serve the entire society.
- And that's exactly what I'm doing.

837
01:31:08,384 --> 01:31:11,470
- Slawek deserves a funeral no matter
who he was. - He was a murderer.

838
01:31:12,375 --> 01:31:13,249
Sorry?

839
01:31:13,375 --> 01:31:15,415
Murderers and victims
are not to be buried together.

840
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:18,124
- Can you hear yourself?
- He was the murderer.

841
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:20,540
- Of young people.
- What murderer?!

842
01:31:20,666 --> 01:31:24,249
No big words, please.
It was an accident, right?

843
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:26,999
Though tragic, it was an accident.

844
01:31:27,125 --> 01:31:30,290
I also hit a boar on the road once...

845
01:31:30,416 --> 01:31:33,582
- A boar, yes, but...
- ... and it was an accident.

846
01:31:33,708 --> 01:31:35,249
No one calls me a murderer.

847
01:31:35,375 --> 01:31:36,476
Of course it was an accident.

848
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:39,707
Plus the state the young people
were in after the party...

849
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:42,124
What state?

850
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:45,124
What state?

851
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:47,165
What state?

852
01:31:47,291 --> 01:31:49,499
Tell me...

853
01:31:50,291 --> 01:31:52,540
What state? I'm asking you!

854
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:58,457
- What state?
- No state, Mum.

855
01:31:58,583 --> 01:32:01,207
- No state meaning?
- No state.

856
01:32:01,333 --> 01:32:03,415
They were sober.

857
01:32:12,375 --> 01:32:15,332
Not only did he kill Kuba,
he killed me as well.

858
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:21,707
I wouldn't have got up from bed

859
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:24,874
if it hadn't been for God.

860
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,457
You are killing yourself.

861
01:32:28,666 --> 01:32:31,915
I hope the vicar will soon return
or I'll just...

862
01:32:35,041 --> 01:32:37,874
Could we talk outside, Father?

863
01:32:46,791 --> 01:32:49,124
What's the matter?

864
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:52,790
The truth is...

865
01:32:54,458 --> 01:32:57,957
We argued before the accident.

866
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:02,790
I threw him out of the house.

867
01:33:06,458 --> 01:33:08,707
And he shouted that...

868
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:12,374
That he'd fucking kill himself
if I didn't let him in.

869
01:33:14,541 --> 01:33:16,624
But I did nothing.

870
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:20,082
Nothing.

871
01:33:20,208 --> 01:33:22,124
And he drove away.

872
01:34:10,125 --> 01:34:12,165
Are you ready?

873
01:34:34,041 --> 01:34:36,082
Let's go.

874
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:55,165
We therefore commit his body
to the ground,

875
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:01,540
earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

876
01:37:02,333 --> 01:37:05,290
in sure and certain hope
of the Resurrection.

877
01:37:05,416 --> 01:37:07,582
Rest in peace.

878
01:37:23,875 --> 01:37:25,749
One more thing...

879
01:37:28,583 --> 01:37:31,540
I'd like to invite you
to the farewell Mass.

880
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,582
Please let everyone know.

881
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:49,624
Are we alone?

882
01:37:50,916 --> 01:37:53,457
- You need a drink or...?
- Where are your things?

883
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:55,915
Pinscher fucked me over?

884
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:17,582
Something's wrong?

885
01:38:23,875 --> 01:38:25,540
God bless you.

886
01:38:28,166 --> 01:38:30,040
God bless you.

887
01:38:33,208 --> 01:38:35,832
Clergy issues.

888
01:38:40,166 --> 01:38:43,124
Unfortunately,
we have very little time and...

889
01:38:43,708 --> 01:38:46,707
We have to go to the Curia now.

890
01:38:49,458 --> 01:38:51,457
What about the farewell Mass?

891
01:38:51,583 --> 01:38:54,415
People are gathering.

892
01:38:54,541 --> 01:38:56,540
It's cancelled.

893
01:38:57,333 --> 01:38:59,415
No. Why?

894
01:39:03,875 --> 01:39:07,999
I told you, Father,
the Bishop was waiting for us.

895
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:10,957
We have time. We'll make it.

896
01:39:11,083 --> 01:39:14,332
I think you should pack
your things, Father.

897
01:39:15,041 --> 01:39:17,165
Come on.

898
01:39:32,083 --> 01:39:34,165
Father Tomasz is going
to come back, right?

899
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:39,207
Who?

900
01:39:39,333 --> 01:39:41,457
Father Tomasz.

901
01:39:53,083 --> 01:39:55,499
It's up to the Curia.

902
01:40:08,583 --> 01:40:10,707
Please, don't worry.

903
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:19,124
The parish will always have a priest.

904
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:39,749
Thank you!

905
01:40:46,333 --> 01:40:49,082
For the Preest

906
01:40:57,583 --> 01:41:00,624
God bless you for raising money
for the treatment.

907
01:41:48,541 --> 01:41:51,207
You think it's fucking fun?!

908
01:41:54,916 --> 01:41:57,207
I didn't hurt anyone.

909
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:20,790
And nobody knew except Pinscher?

910
01:42:24,916 --> 01:42:26,790
Look me in the eye.

911
01:42:30,208 --> 01:42:32,124
No.

912
01:42:40,083 --> 01:42:42,165
Excuse me.

913
01:42:46,583 --> 01:42:48,374
I will celebrate the Mass.

914
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:50,415
Introduce me.
Say your holidays are over.

915
01:42:50,541 --> 01:42:54,165
Then you get changed and wait
at the presbytery with your luggage.

916
01:42:54,291 --> 01:42:57,749
- Get it?
- Yes.

917
01:43:00,416 --> 01:43:02,249
There's one condition.

918
01:43:02,916 --> 01:43:05,415
You have never been here.

919
01:43:05,541 --> 01:43:07,624
Say it.

920
01:43:09,291 --> 01:43:11,290
Go on, say it.

921
01:43:13,791 --> 01:43:17,582
- I have never been here.
- Thank you.

922
01:45:29,583 --> 01:45:31,624
God bless you.

923
01:46:20,375 --> 01:46:23,124
What are you doing?! Fuck off!

924
01:46:23,875 --> 01:46:26,082
Get the fuck outta here!

925
01:46:27,708 --> 01:46:30,957
You thought we're mates?

926
01:46:31,083 --> 01:46:32,790
'Cos we drank fucking vodka?

927
01:46:32,916 --> 01:46:34,957
You fucking nuts?

928
01:46:35,708 --> 01:46:38,415
Your priest's fucking gone, eh?

929
01:46:38,541 --> 01:46:40,540
No dress to hide under.

930
01:46:40,666 --> 01:46:42,874
You sold me.

931
01:46:53,041 --> 01:46:55,332
You're in for a slam tomorrow.

932
01:46:59,666 --> 01:47:03,124
Bless these gifts, O Lord,
and those who made them.

933
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:07,582
And teach us to share these gifts
with the needy. Amen.

934
01:47:28,375 --> 01:47:30,624
When does God speak to us?

935
01:47:32,488 --> 01:47:38,393
The Church believes God speaks to us
in every moment of our life.

936
01:47:38,428 --> 01:47:40,082
Fall in!

937
01:47:46,125 --> 01:47:48,290
- Count off!
- One, two, three...

938
01:47:48,458 --> 01:47:50,082
...four, five, six, seven.

939
01:47:53,833 --> 01:47:59,332
I sometimes commit a sin,
do an evil thing.

940
01:48:01,958 --> 01:48:05,332
It takes me a long time
to admit my guilt.

941
01:48:10,041 --> 01:48:12,290
- Everything's cleared up?
- Yes, sir!

942
01:48:13,291 --> 01:48:16,457
Tools returned?
So you can find it easily.

943
01:48:17,083 --> 01:48:18,707
- Sir!
- What's wrong?

944
01:48:18,833 --> 01:48:20,249
- A boy cut himself.
- Where's he?

945
01:48:20,375 --> 01:48:23,207
- In the warehouse.
- Don't move.

946
01:48:23,333 --> 01:48:25,457
I'll be right back.

947
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:30,290
God speaks to us
through various events in our life.

948
01:48:32,916 --> 01:48:36,165
Sometimes we think

949
01:48:38,041 --> 01:48:40,082
it can't have been God's plan.

950
01:48:41,333 --> 01:48:44,540
Various tragedies strike us.

951
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:47,249
Slam!

952
01:48:47,916 --> 01:48:52,540
But the most important thing
is never to lose faith.

953
01:49:13,208 --> 01:49:14,915
Remember...

954
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,207
It's only a parable.

955
01:49:19,708 --> 01:49:24,040
A parable of how far
you've walked away from God.

956
01:49:26,541 --> 01:49:28,915
Everyone. Even me.

957
01:50:43,583 --> 01:50:45,332
Let go!

958
01:50:45,458 --> 01:50:47,165
Let go!

959
01:50:48,583 --> 01:50:50,374
Not you!

960
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:52,415
Get Bonus over here!

961
01:50:52,666 --> 01:50:54,707
Get the fuck outta here!

962
01:50:54,833 --> 01:50:57,249
Enough! Set fire, now!

963
01:50:57,375 --> 01:50:59,082
Hurry up!

964
