Did you look in on him?

That heifer needs looking at, he said.

Yeah.

Dad had to see to her.

00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:43,619
I could have been quicker,
hobbling around on these damn things.

58
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:45,750
Thank God that lad's on his way.
- Yeah, I could've managed.

59
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:48,204

- Oh, wind your neck in.

66
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,199
I didn't even want him here, did I?
- He were the only bugger to apply'

Let's at least get him here
in one piece, shall we'?

And what about milk?

94
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:04,508
Just got a few beef cattle,
nowt much to speak of.

No, sorry, the sheep.
Do you make cheese?

our lad needs extra help.

It's perfect for me.

103
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:30,842
You got somewhere to go after?

104
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,003
Good, cos we just need someone
for the week, lad.

We're not running a charity

00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:44,782
Have you pressed my collared shirt, Nan?
- It's hung up in your wardrobe.

107
00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:47,691
If you would but try looking further
than your own backside.

108
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:50,652
Right. Got any clean socks an' all?

109

Go easy on the sauce tonight, lad.

I need you to take me
up to Top Fell early tomorrow

111
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,737
show them ewes to this one.

112
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,693
They'll be ripe to drop.

113
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:01,364
Do you hear me?
- Aye, I've heard you.

No, please, it's OK.

118
00:15:10,355 --> 00:15:12,323
I've been travelling a long time.

119

00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:33,619
What's up wi' you?
- Nowt.

125
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:36,943
Well, do you wanna tell your face?

126
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:41,284
Is your dad any better?
- No, he's getting on wi' it, you know.

127
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,904
It must be tough for yous.
- It's a' right.

128
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:48,360
I thought once you lot escaped to your fancy

It's reading week, isn't it?
You know what me mam's like.

130
00:16:50,772 --> 00:16:54,106
Came up with a couple of my uni mates.
Makes it bearable.

131
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,324
Brought 'em to gawp
and laugh at the natives?

132
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:57,736
Get over yourself.

133
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,278
You're not that interesting
as a local tourist attraction.

134
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,857
Got a spare one of them or what?

135
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,653
Come on, you tight wad.
I'm just a poor student.

136
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:23,433
Come on.

137
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:22,539

What?
- That's what I love about folk like you.

140
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:32,669
You fuck off
to your posh colleges an' that

141
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:35,871
and swan back here on your holidays,
thinking you know it all.

142
00:17:37,663 --> 00:17:39,290
Some of us just have
to get on wi' it, like.

143
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:41,882
Alright. It's just a night out.
- Aye, to you.

144
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:44,049
I'll tell me cows they can go
without their teas shall I

145
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:46,044
cos I'm off gallivanting
around Bradford?

146
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:48,694
You'd like my uni mates.
They're a laugh.

147
00:17:48,812 --> 00:17:50,234
One of them's a real laugh.

148
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:52,775
What do you mean by that?

149
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,897
He's nice. You'd like him.
He's funny.

150
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,567
Remember? Like you used to be.

01:03:03,931 --> 01:03:04,932
Yeah.

322
01:03:07,306 --> 01:03:08,273
OK.

323
01:03:09,806 --> 01:03:10,807
Right.

324
01:03:12,097 --> 01:03:13,098
Right.

325
01:03:16,056 --> 01:03:17,057
Bye.

326
01:03:27,478 --> 01:03:31,688
I was thinking,
I could stay a little longer.

327

328
01:03:36,728 --> 01:03:38,401
Just to help out.

329
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,692
No?

01:04:09,845 --> 01:04:11,472

You done the beasts?

344
01:07:10,271 --> 01:07:12,694
How is he?
- Getting on with it.

345
01:07:14,521 --> 01:07:17,149
Do you wanna tell me
what that muck is in my best tea towel?

346
01:07:17,271 --> 01:07:21,697
Cheese. Gheorghe made it.
He milked one of the sheep, like.

347
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:24,531
Have you tried it?
- No, ta.

348
01:07:25,437 --> 01:07:29,772
I see you helped yourself to breakfast.
- Aye. Gheorghe did eggs and that'

349
01:07:29,896 --> 01:07:31,113
Did he?

350
01:07:32,271 --> 01:07:34,239
He's a good lad.

351
01:07:34,813 --> 01:07:36,611
He's gonna stay on for a bit.

Just so as you're clear,
he's here to work.

Yeah, I know.

354
01:07:40,896 --> 01:07:44,275
Right. Just so you're clear.
- I am.

355
01:07:44,396 --> 01:07:46,945
He's gonna fill in
till our dads back to normal.

356
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:51,605
How do you mean?
- Till he's up and about, like.

357
01:07:52,396 --> 01:07:55,479
Your dad's not gonna get
any better, John.

358
01:07:56,438 --> 01:07:58,440
You don't know that. He might.

359
01:07:58,563 --> 01:08:02,773
We were this close to losing him.
Got to face facts, lad.

360
01:08:17,646 --> 01:08:20,274
I'm off to t' pub. You coming?

361
01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:47,270
Did you come here
on your own, then, to England?

362
01:08:47,392 --> 01:08:48,609
Yeah.

363
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:53,444
There was someone once but...

364
01:08:54,975 --> 01:08:56,227
Right.

365
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,102
Will you go back?

366
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,773
My country is dead.

01:09:10,183 --> 01:09:13,357
You can't throw a rock in most towns
without hitting an old lady

369
01:09:19,568 --> 01:09:21,115
I was thinking...

370
01:09:22,776 --> 01:09:27,236
I'm not sure what's gonna happen now
with our dad the way he is, but...

371
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:30,363
how would it be
if you stayed on, like'?

372
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:33,744
I've told you, I can stay.
- Yeah.

373
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:37,824
I guess I just... mean for longer.

374
01:09:38,902 --> 01:09:40,996
It'd be sweet, right?

375
01:09:46,277 --> 01:09:48,655
And how would we work on the farm?

376
01:09:49,569 --> 01:09:51,196
How do you mean?

377
01:09:51,569 --> 01:09:56,996
Well, it can't go on like it has.
You must see that, no?

378
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:01,945
What's the farm got to do with you?
- If I stayed, a lot.

379
01:10:04,412 --> 01:10:06,380
I've been through this before.

380
01:10:06,995 --> 01:10:10,704
On my farm.
I can't go through that again.

381
01:10:11,265 --> 01:10:14,269
It will not survive, believe me.

382
01:10:18,265 --> 01:10:20,893
Have you talked to Martin and Deirdre?
- They'll be fine.

383
01:10:21,015 --> 01:10:22,483
Will they?
- Yeah.

384
01:10:24,473 --> 01:10:26,726
And how will you be?

385
01:10:27,407 --> 01:10:29,535

You. Us.

387
01:10:33,407 --> 01:10:35,455

to get wed or anything.

388
01:10:35,574 --> 01:10:38,544
No, but you're asking me
to stay here with you.

389
01:10:41,282 --> 01:10:43,535

01:32:13,278 --> 01:32:15,201
Try at least.

486
01:32:17,551 --> 01:32:18,848
Anyroad...

487
01:32:22,051 --> 01:32:23,268
Is that it?

488
01:32:29,509 --> 01:32:31,102
Nothing else?

489
01:32:39,599 --> 01:32:41,067
I should...

490
01:32:41,182 --> 01:32:42,684
Yeah.

491
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:44,275
OK.

492
01:32:56,149 --> 01:32:57,571
I'm trying to do this.

493
01:32:58,024 --> 01:33:01,608
Don't you see?
I'm.“ I'm trying to sort it out.

494
01:33:03,274 --> 01:33:07,734
And I've come all this way up here,
on a coach and everything.

495
01:33:09,441 --> 01:33:11,443
And I want you to come back.

496
01:33:12,649 --> 01:33:13,741
With me'

497
01:33:18,358 --> 01:33:20,827
And I want us to be together.

498
01:33:30,299 --> 01:33:32,518
I don't want to be a fuck-up anymore.

499
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:34,552
No, leave me. I'm fine.

500
01:33:38,633 --> 01:33:39,976
I want to be with you.

501
01:33:44,052 --> 01:33:46,054
And that's what I needed to say.

502
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:00,887
You're a freak.

503
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:06,807
So are you.

504
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:10,386
Faggot.

505
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:18,762
Fuck off...

506
01:34:20,343 --> 01:34:21,595
...faggot.

MUSIC: "The Days"

508
01:35:35,857 --> 01:35:37,484
The Days

509
01:35:40,690 --> 01:35:42,408
Passing days

510
01:35:57,149 --> 01:35:59,902
<i>#</i> I see the steeple

511
01:36:02,774 --> 01:36:05,368
<i>#</i> And trace to the spire

512
01:36:07,708 --> 01:36:09,710
<i>#</i> And the sunset

513
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:13,043
 Deep in regret

514
01:36:13,083 --> 01:36:16,053
<i>#</i> Phoenix in final fire

515
01:36:19,166 --> 01:36:22,249
And the time stops

516
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:28,292
Rush-hour traffic slows

517
01:36:30,375 --> 01:36:32,798
And my heart starts

518
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:35,877
# Beating this dark

519
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:39,341
# Through old flesh
and cold bones

520
01:36:41,458 --> 01:36:47,170
<i>#</i> And I long to be carried on

521
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:54,086
<i>#</i> Just once to be lifted strong

522
01:36:55,166 --> 01:36:59,171
<i>#</i> Out of the loneliness

523
01:36:59,208 --> 01:37:01,256
# And the emptiness

524
01:37:01,291 --> 01:37:03,714
<i>#</i> Of the days

525
01:37:06,375 --> 01:37:08,548
# Days

526
01:37:12,583 --> 01:37:14,711
<i># Passing days</i>

527
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,502
# Days

528
01:37:22,541 --> 01:37:27,342
# I remember I had your love once

529
01:37:29,583 --> 01:37:32,507
<i>#</i> Seized my body whole

530
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:38,459
<i>#</i> And in our first dance

531
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,719
# I thought by chance

532
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:44,209
<i>#</i> God had matched my soul

533
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:49,755
<i>#</i> But time brought its travelling

534
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:54,470
# This distance and solitude

535
01:37:58,083 --> 01:38:00,836
# And in that travelling

536
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:03,128
<i>#</i> My self damaging

537
01:38:03,166 --> 01:38:08,593
<i>#</i> I took my love far, far from you

538
01:38:09,333 --> 01:38:15,545
<i>#</i> But don't you still
long to be carried on

539
01:38:16,958 --> 01:38:21,168
<i>#</i> Once more I could lift you strong

540
01:38:23,041 --> 01:38:26,124
<i>#</i> Out of the loneliness

541
01:38:26,916 --> 01:38:29,089

Passing days

Days

546
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,752
Tell me

547
01:38:53,791 --> 01:38:56,385
 Have we gone too far?

548
01:38:56,416 --> 01:38:59,420
<i>#</i> Or did we get too close?

549

You've no father

I've no son

 But when we come ghost

552
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:08,379
 I promise I will meet you
