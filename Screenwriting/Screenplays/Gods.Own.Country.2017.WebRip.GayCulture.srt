Maybe next time you'll frame yourself.
I could have been quicker, hobbling around on these damn things.
Thank God that lad's on his way.

Let's all give you a round of applause, shall we?

Might be a tin of fruit cocktail you can have.
Go easy on that.
I want that lad picking up in good time.
Why do I have to go?

Let's at least get him here in one piece, shall we'?
Whatever.

Oh, enough mardy arse'
You're getting on my wick.
Fuck's sake.
BEEPS HORN
Do they call thee Georgie or summat?
Gheorghe.
- Whatever. Get in.
That'll be as much use as a chocolate fireguard up here.
It's a bit of a midden, like.
That thing unfolds out into like a bed thing.
You can switch that on, but it's a gas bottle, mind, so don't go mad wi' it.
There's a bog in there.
This looks OK.
You half-Paki or summat?
- Pardon?
Er, no, I am from Romania.
Gypsy.
- Please don't call me that.
That door needs a shove.
Don't always close proper'

I told you, didn't I?
Shitehole, Bet you wish you'd stayed in Romania.
HE SIGHS
I hate train journeys, me.
I always end up gipping my guts up.
When were you last on a train?
I'm just saying.
It's 100 odd Swaledale crossed blackface gimmers.
Do you understand me?
And what about milk?
Just got a few beef cattle, nowt much to speak of.
No, sorry, the sheep.
Do you make cheese?
It's very good cheese, and good money.
DEIHDRE:
Your English is good.
My mother teaches English back in Romania.
Fancy.
We muddle through on our own most of t' time but wi' lambing and that our lad needs extra help.
It's perfect for me.
You got somewhere to go after?
Good, cos we just need someone for the week, lad.
We're not running a charity for waifs and strays, like.
Have you pressed my collared shirt, Nan?
- It's hung up in your wardrobe.
If you would but try looking further than your own backside.
Right. Got any clean socks an' all?
Go easy on the sauce tonight, lad.
I need you to take me up to Top Fell early tomorrow show them ewes to this one.
They'll be ripe to drop.
Do you hear me?
- Aye, I've heard you.
What are you two in cahoots about?
JOHNNY: Nowt. Ta.
- MARTIN: Oi, ignorant!
Why don't you ask him if he fancies a pint'?
No, please, it's OK.
I've been travelling a long time.
It's best I will just go to sleep tonight.

- Nowt.
Well, do you wanna tell your face?
Is your dad any better?
- No, he's getting on wi' it, you know.
It must be tough for yous.
- It's a' right.
I thought once you lot escaped to your fancy colleges and that, you'd never come back.
It's reading week, isn't it?
You know what me mam's like.
Came up with a couple of my uni mates.
Makes it bearable.
Brought 'em to gawp and laugh at the natives?
Get over yourself.
You're not that interesting as a local tourist attraction.
Got a spare one of them or what?
Come on, you tight wad.
I'm just a poor student.
Come on.
Ta.
We should have a night out.
Bradford or somewhere?
What?
- That's what I love about folk like you.
You fuck off to your posh colleges an' that and swan back here on your holidays, thinking you know it all.
Some of us just have to get on wi' it, like.
Alright. It's just a night out.
- Aye, to you.
I'll tell me cows they can go without their teas shall I cos I'm off gallivanting around Bradford?
You'd like my uni mates.
They're a laugh.
One of them's a real laugh.
What do you mean by that?
He's nice. You'd like him.
He's funny.
Remember? Like you used to be.
Before I had to join the real world.
You know what? Forget it.
You can be a right pain in the arse,
John Saxby.
And not in a good way.
Yeah, whatever.
Enjoy your holidays.

Aye, well, I can take you now.
I'll just pick the truck up.
You're too late. He took me.
Them ewes have started.
And what about that boundary wall being down'?
Right. You can lamb up on t' fell, rebuild that wall while you're at it.
Can't we bring 'em down?
- No, you can't.
You'll learn, lad.
You sh0uld've bothered fixin' t' fencing in t' back paddock when I asked you months back.
Might stop you getting kaylied on a nightly basis an' all.
I have a few pints on a night-time.
So what'?
What else am I meant to do apart from work, like?
There's fuck all else going on round here, is there?
I'd keep a lid on it if I were you.
What's wrong with just wanting a night out somewhere?
Bradford or somewhere, I don't know.
- Don't talk daft.
I'm not you, you know.
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
No one gives a flying fuck what I think.
I'm just here to slog me guts out cos you're fucking fucked.
- I'm what'?
Nowt. Forget it.
Oh, no, you've clearly got summat you wanna say'
Ow!
Jesus wept! I'm sick of this.

Do we understand each other?
Good.
Now we can get on with the work.
Yes?
Yeah.
A vet should see this.
Do you have antiseptic?

In my country, spring is the most beautiful.
The sun.
The flowers.
The smells.
Mam loved it when spring came.
'Winter's too long up here,' she'd say.
Your mother?
Don't think she were very happy.
They called her Annie.
Wanted to be a hairdresser or summat in a town down south.
Must have been hard.
I don't really remember.
She left and".
We just got on with it, so...
Where are you going?
GEESE CACKLE

On Friday, it was 50 years to the day since the funeral of Winston Churchill...
What's wrong wi' you?

The mill provides the wool for ceremonial uniforms in the Ministry of Defence...
I can do that for you, Nan.
Are you sickening for summat?
- No.
Night.
Shouldn't we wait?
No, let's go to bed.
Do you mean here?

SCRAPING
DEIFIDFIE:
Doctor's just been round.
Young coloured lass.
Nice little thing'
Said a second stroke's quite common after what Dad's been through.
Said it could be to do with the stress.
Have you had your teas?
I should've left you summat out.
I'm not fussed.
Nay, damn it, lad.
It's all on your shoulders now.
You can't go getting poorly an' all.

Hello?
Alright, Nan.
Yeah.
OK.

Until Martin is better.
Just to help out.
No?
How do you say 'farm'?
Ferma.
How do you say 'sheep'?
Oaie.
How do you say...
...cock?
Cock.
When you've finished fannying with that
I need your help to get them ewes down before night.
I'll be two minutes.

SHE SIGHS
SHE CRIES QUIETLY
Just bobbed back to get your dad some clean jim-jams and that'
You done the beasts?
How is he?
- Getting on with it.
Do you wanna tell me what that muck is in my best tea towel?
Cheese. Gheorghe made it.
He milked one of the sheep, like.
Have you tried it?
- No, ta.
I see you helped yourself to breakfast.
- Aye. Gheorghe did eggs and that'
Did he?
He's a good lad.
He's gonna stay on for a bit.
Just so as you're clear, he's here to work.
Yeah, I know.
Right. Just so you're clear.
- I am.
He's gonna fill in till our dads back to normal.
How do you mean?
- Till he's up and about, like.
Your dad's not gonna get any better, John.
You don't know that. He might.
We were this close to losing him.
Got to face facts, lad.
I'm off to t' pub. You coming?
Did you come here on your own, then, to England?
Yeah.
There was someone once but...
Right.
Will you go back?
My country is dead.
You can't throw a rock in most towns without hitting an old lady crying for her children who have gone.
I was thinking...
I'm not sure what's gonna happen now with our dad the way he is, but... how would it be if you stayed on, like'?
I've told you, I can stay.
- Yeah.
I guess I just... mean for longer.
It'd be sweet, right?
And how would we work on the farm?
How do you mean?
Well, it can't go on like it has.
You must see that, no?
What's the farm got to do with you?
- If I stayed, a lot.
I've been through this before.
On my farm.
I can't go through that again.
It will not survive, believe me.
Have you talked to Martin and Deirdre?
- They'll be fine.
Will they?
- Yeah.
And how will you be?
How do you mean?
You. Us.
It's not like I'm asking you to get wed or anything.
No, but you're asking me to stay here with you.
Do you understand me?
- Alright!
I've heard you.
We'll have two more of these when you're ready and a couple of Sambuca shots.
I think I've had enough.
Want another?
- I haven't finished that one yet.
Well, sup up, then.

Why did you just leave?
You shouldn't have come.
I'm not the answer.
Yeah. I know.
But I needed to see you.

So are you.

MUSIC: "The Days" by Patrick Wolf
The Days
Passing days d I see the steeple d And trace to the spire d And the sunset
Deep in regret d Phoenix in final fire
And the time stops
Rush-hour traffic slows
And my heart starts d Beating this dark d Through old flesh and cold bones d And I long to be carried on d Just once to be lifted strong d Out of the loneliness d And the emptiness d Of the days d Days d Passing days d Days d I remember I had your love once d Seized my body whole d And in our first dance d I thought by chance d God had matched my soul d But time brought its travelling d This distance and solitude d And in that travelling d My self damaging d I took my love far, far from you d But don't you still long to be carried on d Once more I could lift you strong d Out of the loneliness d And the emptiness d Of the days
Passing days
Passing days
Days
Tell me
Have we gone too far? d Or did we get too close?
You've no father
I've no son
But when we come ghost
I promise I will meet you s: I will meet you d At the end of the days
The days
Passing days d Won't you meet me at the end of the days'? it
