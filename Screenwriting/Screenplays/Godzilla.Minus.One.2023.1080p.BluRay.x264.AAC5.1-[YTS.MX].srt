00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:17,930
{\an8}1945, ODO ISLAND AIRFIELD,
FINAL DAYS OF WORLD WAR II

4
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:21,541
{\an8}ODO ISLAND NAVY DETACHMENT

5
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:25,734
- The engine is fine. - Roger.

6
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,678
- Fully refueled.
- Roger.

7
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:38,601
Lieutenant Shikishima?

8
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:44,387
Tsukuba Naval Air Corps, Tachibana.
Remember me?

9
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:49,349
Of course.
I am greatly in your debt.

10
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:53,618
I'm amazed you were able
to land that bucket of bolts...

11
00:01:53,893 --> 00:01:56,951
on this Swiss cheese of a runway.

12
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:59,817
You haven't lost your touch.

13
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:05,282
In simulated dogfights, yes,
but suddenly I'm a real kamikaze pilot.

14
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:10,528
Then be grateful for the down time.

15
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:15,097
But it's strange.

16
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:19,493
We have examined the aircraft
but we could not find any defects.

17
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,056
What are you implying?

18
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:52,176
Don't worry, I'm totally on your side.
We need more people like you.

19
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:04,735
Why obey an order to "die honorably"
when the outcome is already clear?

20
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:03,053
- Get the guns!
- Yes, sir!

21
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:05,724
- Enemy raid?
- I don't know!

22
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:08,394
- What is it?
- Something big!

23
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:10,546
A new Yankee weapon?

24
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:18,213
Taki, Taki!

25
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,978
- Light the beach!
- Roger!

26
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:35,022
Taki!

27
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:36,834
What in the hell?

28
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,592
It's Godzilla.

29
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:41,058
- What?
- A local told me.

30
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:44,428
That comes from the deep,
Godzilla they call it.

31
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:45,959
G... G-Godzilla?

32
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,750
We're screwed. Take cover!

33
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:57,620
Take cover!

34
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:10,004
What the hell is that?

35
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:11,966
Nobody knows.

36
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,980
- Lieutenant Shikishima. - Sir?

37
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,246
Can you reach your 20mm machine gun?

38
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,753
You're our only gunner.
We're just mechanics.

39
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,426
But what if it only makes it angry?

40
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,099
A 20-mm machine gun can kill anything.

41
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:32,287
Hurry, before it gets too close.

42
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:34,525
Go now!

43
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,778
Go!

44
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,815
Hurry up!

45
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,555
What's he doing in there?

46
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:18,594
Quick, shoot!

47
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:34,126
It's coming this way.

48
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,978
- What do we do, sir?
- Ammo!

49
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:39,157
Fetch the ammo!

50
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,939
You idiot! Don't shoot!

51
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:50,161
Cease fire!

52
00:06:50,186 --> 00:06:52,130
You must not shoot!

53
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,096
Fall back! Fall back!

54
00:06:59,183 --> 00:07:00,460
Retreat!

55
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:06,982
Sir Tachibana!

56
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:49,351
I lure it over. And then you shoot it down!

57
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:05,250
You guys didn't deserve this.

58
00:09:16,219 --> 00:09:17,528
Hello?

59
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:28,152
Everyone is dead!

60
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:31,792
They're all dead!

61
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,937
Because you didn't shoot.

62
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,978
Damn it!

63
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:22,397
You...

64
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:24,666
Listen now!

65
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:06,336
December 1945 Tokyo

66
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,436
Look out!

67
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:22,634
Is that you, Koichi?

68
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:27,480
Sumiko!

69
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:29,525
How is this possible?

70
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:33,069
Weren't you a kamikaze pilot?

71
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:42,948
You have the nerve to show your face?

72
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:45,746
You are a disgrace!

73
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:51,319
Look what happened
because of cowards like you!

74
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:55,947
If you'd only done your job...

75
00:11:56,704 --> 00:11:59,338
My children wouldn't have died.

76
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:11,912
Do you know if my parents are still alive?

77
00:12:18,962 --> 00:12:21,633
Everyone is dead.

78
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,070
The whole place was in flames.

79
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:32,632
Your parents too.

80
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:37,868
My children met the same fate.

81
00:12:51,176 --> 00:12:54,300
'Koichi, my dear son…

82
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:58,189
"Come back alive," right?

83
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:03,346
That's what you said.

84
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:21,058
Stop the thief!

85
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:24,430
Move. Move!

86
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:27,776
- To the side!
- Grab the woman!

87
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,654
- Here!
- What?

88
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:34,849
Get back here!

89
00:13:38,012 --> 00:13:39,409
What...

90
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:09,559
Hello.

91
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:15,311
Finally.
Where did you go?

92
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:20,604
It's your fault
for sitting out in the open.

93
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:23,815
You've been here the whole time?

94
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:29,581
Yeah, waiting for you to get up and move.

95
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:32,337
You must be hungry.

96
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,401
Why didn't you just leave her behind?

97
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,835
What?

98
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:44,609
Leave her in a place like that?

99
00:14:46,849 --> 00:14:48,269
Stop joking.

100
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,864
Wait a minute!

101
00:14:54,664 --> 00:14:56,947
Please don't follow me.

102
00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:59,822
Are you going to leave us to die on the streets?

103
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:01,794
I don't care.

104
00:15:07,097 --> 00:15:09,803
You must leave when you finish eating.

105
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:13,352
Do you hear that? He's so mean and scary.

106
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:19,029
Where is your husband?

107
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,319
Is he a soldier?

108
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:25,858
- Do I look like I have a husband?
- What?

109
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:28,765
Whose kid is she?

110
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:32,995
- Does it matter?
- Of course it does!

111
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:38,490
During the air raids...

112
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,592
her dying mother begged me to adopt her.

113
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:45,607
So you are…

114
00:15:45,787 --> 00:15:48,724
so not related to this child at all?

115
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,815
Nope, so what?

116
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:56,047
What are you, stupid?

117
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:59,368
You're in no state to care for a baby.

118
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:02,216
You couldn't leave her behind either.

119
00:16:08,814 --> 00:16:10,154
Name?

120
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:15,322
"Akiko"

121
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,848
No, I meant you.

122
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:22,008
Noriko.

123
00:16:24,972 --> 00:16:29,825
Why do you dress like a vagrant?
By choice?

124
00:16:30,126 --> 00:16:31,919
Well, I'm no harlot.

125
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:33,827
Don't look so offended.

126
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:39,084
To find a way to survive.
No one can blame you for that.

127
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:46,765
And what about family?

128
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,316
{\an8}HARU SHIKISHIMA - EIICHIRO SHIKISHIMA

129
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:57,823
Your parents?

130
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,233
Yes.

131
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,380
They were killed in the air raids.

132
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:14,614
Then you and I are the same.

133
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,973
What?

134
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:36,960
No, you can't...

135
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,683
stay...

136
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:55,578
Hey!

137
00:17:57,502 --> 00:17:59,575
What's the story?

138
00:18:00,635 --> 00:18:03,666
- What do you mean?
- Don't play dumb.

139
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:07,005
The mother and child you picked up.

140
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:10,871
- Think you're some kind of saint?
- No.

141
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:13,959
They just showed up.

142
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:17,714
If they're staying, you picked them up.

143
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:24,452
It's a bit late to play the hero.

144
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,885
Count me out.
No more caring for others.

145
00:18:34,843 --> 00:18:36,265
Wait.

146
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,383
Is that girl able to breast feed?

147
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:47,149
No, she is not the child's mother.

148
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,730
Say what?

149
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:04,969
At this rate, she'll die of malnutrition.

150
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:06,546
Right?

151
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:12,420
So you've found a child,
but have no idea how to provide for it.

152
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,776
What were you thinking?

153
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:16,849
Sorry I didn't know.

154
00:19:25,061 --> 00:19:27,090
It's not for you.

155
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:30,889
Adults can survive on all kinds of food.

156
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:37,829
Make porridge out of it.

157
00:19:38,942 --> 00:19:40,525
Well...

158
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:43,670
there goes my prized white rice.

159
00:19:44,535 --> 00:19:46,943
What a nuisance, I swear.

160
00:19:53,614 --> 00:19:58,176
March, 1946

161
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:02,059
Damn, I'm drenched.

162
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:10,636
Have you found a job yet?

163
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:14,508
Well I did find something.

164
00:20:14,738 --> 00:20:16,290
What's that?

165
00:20:17,837 --> 00:20:20,079
Money's not bad, either.

166
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:24,626
Look. They even paid an advance
of 3,000 yen.

167
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:26,619
That's wonderful!

168
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:35,566
It must be a scam.
Like the rice you carried that got stolen.

169
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,118
It's nothing like that.

170
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,151
What makes you so sure?

171
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:43,500
It's government approved.

172
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:46,216
There's a reason why it pays well.

173
00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:47,803
And what is the reason then?

174
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:53,532
During the war, both sides laid
thousands of mines in the sea.

175
00:20:54,315 --> 00:20:56,122
It's a cleanup job.

176
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,971
The pay is good because, uh...

177
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:07,900
the work is quite risky.

178
00:21:09,874 --> 00:21:13,476
What are you, crazy?
You just survived a war.

179
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:15,351
What else can I do?

180
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:19,555
At this rate, we'll starve.
Akiko's life depends on it.

181
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,053
I understand that, but...

182
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,254
This brings in money.

183
00:21:28,443 --> 00:21:34,234
With money, we can even buy American powdered milk!
For that, I'd do...

184
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,303
I forbid you to die!

185
00:21:40,764 --> 00:21:46,049
Don't worry. Just because it's
dangerous doesn't mean I'll die.

186
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:50,185
It's not like being a kamikaze pilot.

187
00:21:54,616 --> 00:21:59,865
And besides... I'll be on a special boat
made to evade mines.

188
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:07,867
This is specially made?

189
00:22:21,814 --> 00:22:25,751
- Hey, are you our new sharpshooter?
- I'm Shikishima.

190
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:27,882
- Sailor?
- Fighter pilot.

191
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:31,886
- What? The guy is useless.
- Are you an ex-pilot?

192
00:22:31,911 --> 00:22:34,707
Just a military castoff.
Worthless.

193
00:22:34,732 --> 00:22:39,204
Disappointed? Seeing this boat?

194
00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:44,441
The US and imperial navies laid
60,000 mines off Japan's coasts.

195
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:49,132
All kinds. But the worst are
the American magnetic mine.

196
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:53,497
Any approaching boat made
of metal sets them off.

197
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:57,486
Ah, hence the wood.

198
00:22:57,511 --> 00:23:00,110
The boy catches on fast.

199
00:23:00,365 --> 00:23:03,055
We mostly handle moored mines.

200
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,826
But wood boats are the best
countermeasure.

201
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:11,116
I'm Noda.

202
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:15,036
I developed naval weapons
during the war.

203
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:19,381
Boat captain Akitsu, and Mizushima.
"The kid" and "Doc."

204
00:23:19,406 --> 00:23:23,445
- Not fond of that nickname.
- And I'm no Kid.

205
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,128
You're still green, so "Kid" it is.

206
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:29,543
I know, I know.
I wasn't in the war.

207
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:34,277
This is the minesweeper Shinseimaru.
Paired with Kaishinmaru.

208
00:23:34,685 --> 00:23:39,011
The mines rise up from the seabed
like balloons on strings.

209
00:23:39,396 --> 00:23:43,624
A cutting claw is placed
between the two boats.

210
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:46,384
All we do is clip the mine wire...

211
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:48,657
and it floats to the surface.

212
00:23:48,682 --> 00:23:53,133
Then we fire on it with this baby, Okay?

213
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:55,391
Take a look.

214
00:24:06,597 --> 00:24:08,832
Well... This one is a bit tricky.

215
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,864
May I give it a try?

216
00:24:11,202 --> 00:24:13,180
Are you sure?

217
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:23,094
You have to estimate it's position
accounting for the movement.

218
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:31,469
Whoo-hoo!

219
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,287
- Nice shot!
- It's the same as in a fighter plane.

220
00:24:36,312 --> 00:24:40,059
- Although I haven't been in action.
- What?

221
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:45,262
You didn't? That makes me
and Shikishima equals.

222
00:24:45,287 --> 00:24:48,112
Hardly. You can't fly a plane.

223
00:24:48,137 --> 00:24:51,225
If I'd gone to war, I would've learned.

224
00:24:51,354 --> 00:24:54,425
Only the war had lasted a little longer.

225
00:24:56,749 --> 00:24:58,966
You can't think that.

226
00:25:02,077 --> 00:25:03,568
No sorry.

227
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,383
You are a fool.

228
00:25:38,424 --> 00:25:41,230
Shoot, shoot. Seek cover!

229
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,025
Everything is alright?

230
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:09,746
Did you dream again?

231
00:26:17,318 --> 00:26:18,791
A dream?

232
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,564
And.

233
00:26:24,732 --> 00:26:26,884
I lay dreaming.

234
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:35,846
Or maybe...

235
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:39,320
are you just a dream

236
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:42,155
What is wrong with you? You can tell me.

237
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,258
It's Japan, right here?

238
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:47,165
I survived, didn't I?

239
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:50,045
- I survived. - Stop!

240
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,242
Yes, now I know.

241
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:13,959
I know.

242
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:17,241
Now I know.

243
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,280
July 1946 Bikini Atoll,
Operation Crossroads

244
00:28:23,696 --> 00:28:27,617
Nice place you built here, Shikishima.
Worth every saved penny..

245
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:37,039
- Do you want something to drink?
- Oh thank you.

246
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:41,783
Can I take a picture?

247
00:28:42,218 --> 00:28:45,941
- Don't waste your movie on me.
- Maybe a little smile?

248
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:48,385
Yes, like that! Just like that!

249
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:49,960
Perfect.

250
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:55,687
- Thanks.
- Listen, Doc. Stay in your skin, right?

251
00:28:55,712 --> 00:28:59,471
Of course. Noriko is a married woman.

252
00:28:59,496 --> 00:29:01,231
Please stop.

253
00:29:01,256 --> 00:29:03,288
I'm not married.

254
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:08,158
What should it say?

255
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:10,402
She just moved in here.

256
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:14,092
She had nowhere else to go,
so I let her stay.

257
00:29:14,877 --> 00:29:16,296
And the child?

258
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:20,289
She brought her, too.
But they aren't related.

259
00:29:20,622 --> 00:29:24,265
Akiko was orphaned during the air raids.

260
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:28,853
- Wow, that's a beautiful story!
- No.

261
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:31,015
It just sort of happened.

262
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,134
Father.

263
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,278
- Akiko.
- Yes?

264
00:29:39,993 --> 00:29:43,103
I told you. I'm not your father.

265
00:29:45,055 --> 00:29:46,992
Shikishima.

266
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:50,057
- Don't say that.
- He's right.

267
00:29:50,897 --> 00:29:54,908
Fate has brought you together as a family.

268
00:29:55,241 --> 00:30:00,510
- Accept it. Embrace it.
- Make them happy.

269
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:02,156
Then that's enough!

270
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:04,576
What are you wearing?

271
00:30:09,903 --> 00:30:11,727
Why not?

272
00:30:17,653 --> 00:30:21,653
March, 1947

273
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:29,664
Welcome home. I just got home too.

274
00:30:30,201 --> 00:30:32,314
What kind of clothes are you wearing?

275
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:39,525
How does it look?
I got a desk job in Ginza.

276
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,880
But don't I give you enough money?

277
00:30:48,457 --> 00:30:51,457
It's time I stood on my own two feet.

278
00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:56,253
At this rate,
you'll never find a wife.

279
00:30:59,949 --> 00:31:03,519
Have you seen how fast Ginza
is rebuilding?

280
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:06,126
It's just so sudden.

281
00:31:06,676 --> 00:31:08,645
Not for me, it isn't.

282
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:11,798
What about Akiko?

283
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:17,865
What will you do with Akiko
while you are away at work?

284
00:31:18,324 --> 00:31:21,287
Sumiko has promised to look after her.

285
00:31:22,969 --> 00:31:27,387
She was very excited,
boasting she'd raised three kids already.

286
00:31:30,446 --> 00:31:33,829
In that case,
I suppose it's all right.

287
00:31:34,953 --> 00:31:37,659
Thanks. I'll go get Akiko now.

288
00:31:49,806 --> 00:31:54,276
The cruiser USS Lancaster was attacked
and eliminated by an unknown enemy.

289
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:58,286
Further details are missing at this time.

290
00:31:58,311 --> 00:32:01,830
The navy picked up distress signals...

291
00:32:01,855 --> 00:32:03,891
from the Pacific Ocean.

292
00:32:04,186 --> 00:32:06,366
After successfully photographing
the object…

293
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,885
the ship made physical contact
and was eliminated.

294
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:13,931
Radioactive signals were picked up
when the ship hit the creature.

295
00:32:18,785 --> 00:32:22,867
The colossal sea creature
is projected on a course...

296
00:32:22,892 --> 00:32:27,428
to reach the Japanese
archipelago within a few weeks.

297
00:32:29,277 --> 00:32:33,308
General Douglas MacArthur
stated with regret...

298
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:38,428
that recent Soviet movements
prevent US military assistance...

299
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:41,303
but called upon Japan...

300
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:45,816
to begin strengthening its security forces.

301
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:52,035
May 1947
Near the Ogasawara Islands

302
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:00,725
What has caused this?

303
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,465
A giant shark?

304
00:33:04,102 --> 00:33:05,663
Or a whale?

305
00:33:05,688 --> 00:33:08,884
No shark or whale could do that.

306
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:11,059
A new Soviet weapon?

307
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:13,093
That's not weapon damage.

308
00:33:13,168 --> 00:33:14,989
So what could it be?

309
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,559
- An enormous creature.
- Of what kind?

310
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:21,232
Just admit you don't know.

311
00:33:21,257 --> 00:33:24,532
I was skeptical until I saw it myself.

312
00:33:26,853 --> 00:33:28,409
Godzilla.

313
00:33:30,423 --> 00:33:32,104
Look there!

314
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:37,247
Floating deep sea fish.

315
00:33:37,327 --> 00:33:39,775
Just like at Odo Island.

316
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:42,283
What did you see there?

317
00:33:42,494 --> 00:33:46,576
It was like a prehistoric dinosaur
turned monster.

318
00:33:46,882 --> 00:33:50,805
The local inhabitants called it "Godzilla."

319
00:33:51,593 --> 00:33:52,888
Godzilla?

320
00:33:52,913 --> 00:33:56,583
Nonsense. You were half asleep
and saw an enemy tank.

321
00:33:56,608 --> 00:34:00,362
Believe me or not,
something wiped out...

322
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:03,682
the entire garrison on Odo.

323
00:34:04,113 --> 00:34:05,833
Hold on.

324
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:08,699
I thought it was the Americans.

325
00:34:10,153 --> 00:34:13,972
Odo was never targeted by
US island-hopping forces.

326
00:34:14,174 --> 00:34:17,904
It was a repair base for kamikaze planes.

327
00:34:19,236 --> 00:34:20,850
Does this mean that...

328
00:34:21,717 --> 00:34:24,070
have you been a kamikaze pilot?

329
00:34:29,755 --> 00:34:33,041
If it's the same Godzilla I saw back then…

330
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:36,700
it must have grown much larger
and more powerful.

331
00:34:42,772 --> 00:34:44,705
Hold on a second.

332
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:48,655
Why were we called out here to begin with?

333
00:34:49,184 --> 00:34:53,520
They don't expect us to
fight that in this boat!

334
00:34:53,545 --> 00:34:55,287
Yes, they do.

335
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:58,553
We don't stand a chance!

336
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:03,522
That's a US warship!
What can we do in this little rig?

337
00:35:03,548 --> 00:35:05,697
Stall for time.

338
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:10,746
- Stall?
- The Takao is coming from Singapore.

339
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,365
The heavy cruiser?

340
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:16,824
Rather than scuttle it,
it's being returned.

341
00:35:17,774 --> 00:35:20,382
That's good news!
The Takao's a beast!

342
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:24,408
So we've been ordered to stall for time.

343
00:35:24,493 --> 00:35:28,493
Why can't the US handle it?
It's their ship.

344
00:35:28,547 --> 00:35:31,699
They're worried about the Soviets.

345
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:35,285
Any military maneuvers would raise alarms.

346
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:38,670
They prefer we handle the small stuff.

347
00:35:38,695 --> 00:35:42,738
This isn't small stuff,
and all we've got is a 13 mm gun.

348
00:35:42,763 --> 00:35:46,253
I was told to make use of recovered mines.

349
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:51,172
Ah, now I see!
This is why they called us out here.

350
00:35:51,197 --> 00:35:55,474
Plus our main weapon has to be
locally scavenged?

351
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:59,939
We are not to say anything to anyone either.

352
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:03,095
There it is.
Their favorite gag order.

353
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:06,675
This country never changes.

354
00:36:07,394 --> 00:36:09,373
Perhaps it can't.

355
00:36:18,412 --> 00:36:20,390
Take a breather.

356
00:36:22,342 --> 00:36:23,789
Thank you.

357
00:36:24,564 --> 00:36:27,310
Don't push yourself too hard.

358
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:30,818
I can't help it. This is Godzilla.

359
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:34,006
I hear you.

360
00:36:34,298 --> 00:36:38,036
When I start remembering the war...

361
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:40,683
I get sleepless nights.

362
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:43,559
I will avenge them.

363
00:36:43,682 --> 00:36:45,651
But at the same time, I am…

364
00:36:46,433 --> 00:36:48,630
terrified of the monster.

365
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:58,650
We'll need more than a pair of those.

366
00:37:04,821 --> 00:37:06,316
What is it?

367
00:37:24,412 --> 00:37:28,499
There are way more of these fish
then I saw off Odo.

368
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:34,618
Sound the alarm. Sound the alarm!

369
00:37:34,649 --> 00:37:36,462
Godzilla is coming!

370
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:38,138
Sound the alarm!

371
00:37:39,538 --> 00:37:41,933
So it's coming, huh?

372
00:37:42,053 --> 00:37:44,823
Hey kid!
Prepare to drop the mines!

373
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:46,562
- Roger!
- Man the gun!

374
00:37:46,587 --> 00:37:49,240
We can't fight it on this!

375
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:51,897
- We can still flee!
- Agreed.

376
00:37:51,922 --> 00:37:54,600
- Doc, stand by aft and report!
- Captain!

377
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:56,811
Kashinmaru, do you copy?

378
00:37:57,053 --> 00:38:00,009
Get ready to land a big one!

379
00:38:00,198 --> 00:38:03,117
We take credit for the victory.

380
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:04,761
- You idiot.
- Captain!

381
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:07,622
If we run, Takao will never catch up.

382
00:38:07,647 --> 00:38:10,100
And the monster heads for Tokyo.

383
00:38:11,197 --> 00:38:14,075
I don't want to see it in flames again.

384
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,323
We don't stand a chance in this boat!

385
00:38:16,498 --> 00:38:19,257
I thought you hated government orders.

386
00:38:19,282 --> 00:38:22,415
With a passion.
But you know what?

387
00:38:23,395 --> 00:38:26,197
Someone has to do it.

388
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:45,426
Okay, never mind!

389
00:38:49,236 --> 00:38:50,718
Doc, the engine!

390
00:38:50,743 --> 00:38:52,558
I'm on it!

391
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:54,177
Shikishima!

392
00:38:55,306 --> 00:38:57,149
Shikishima!

393
00:38:57,324 --> 00:38:59,359
Hurry up. Here!

394
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:03,033
- Captain!
- I know!

395
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:05,647
- Full speed ahead!
- Okay!

396
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,359
Drop the mine!

397
00:39:29,106 --> 00:39:31,280
We'll never make it!

398
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:33,529
So try anything!

399
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:54,330
Now, Kid!

400
00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:56,282
This is it!

401
00:40:01,765 --> 00:40:02,971
Did it work?

402
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:10,848
No, it didn't.

403
00:40:10,873 --> 00:40:13,330
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad...

404
00:40:13,506 --> 00:40:15,319
Shikishima, the gun!

405
00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:16,572
Roger!

406
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:25,505
Shikishima!

407
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:38,351
It's no use at all!

408
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:45,514
The mouth! What about the mouth?

409
00:40:47,536 --> 00:40:51,445
Reel! Reel! Reel!

410
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:53,372
Drop it!

411
00:41:00,068 --> 00:41:02,361
Mizushima, now!

412
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:03,796
Right!

413
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:15,190
What? No!

414
00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:17,018
No!

415
00:41:28,802 --> 00:41:31,090
Get down!

416
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:55,609
Did we get it?

417
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,148
No.

418
00:42:29,763 --> 00:42:31,434
Takao!

419
00:42:31,532 --> 00:42:33,354
They made it!

420
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:02,731
Oh no!

421
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,990
Is it down?

422
00:43:52,323 --> 00:43:53,723
What's that?

423
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:56,445
You're finally awake.

424
00:44:57,898 --> 00:44:59,613
Where am I?

425
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:03,206
A Yokosuka hospital.
We were airlifted here.

426
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,966
And Kaishinmaru and Takao?

427
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:15,910
Godzilla.

428
00:45:16,235 --> 00:45:18,869
What happened to the monster?

429
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:21,728
We don't know where it is.

430
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:26,028
It's on its way to Tokyo.
The city must be evacuated.

431
00:45:26,053 --> 00:45:29,620
The government is not telling the public.

432
00:45:29,645 --> 00:45:31,872
Why? We must hurry!

433
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:34,665
To prevent mayhem and confusion.

434
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,749
Are you kidding me?
We need to begin evacuating now!

435
00:45:38,774 --> 00:45:41,457
No one will take responsibility...

436
00:45:42,024 --> 00:45:43,630
for all that chaos.

437
00:45:43,655 --> 00:45:46,679
Information control is Japan's specialty.

438
00:45:55,444 --> 00:45:57,444
Tell me what happened.

439
00:45:59,044 --> 00:46:01,986
It has nothing to do with you.

440
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:06,759
What's bothering you so much?

441
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:13,238
You took me in, saved me,
and we've been together since.

442
00:46:13,675 --> 00:46:17,741
But there is a part of your life
that you hide from me.

443
00:46:24,842 --> 00:46:27,685
If you are carrying some burden...

444
00:46:28,365 --> 00:46:31,017
I wish you'd share it with me.

445
00:46:42,642 --> 00:46:44,115
I am...

446
00:46:45,975 --> 00:46:47,495
someone...

447
00:46:57,372 --> 00:46:59,682
who fled my duty...

448
00:47:03,366 --> 00:47:05,522
as a Kamikaze pilot.

449
00:47:06,483 --> 00:47:07,839
What?

450
00:47:08,253 --> 00:47:10,514
The day I had to do my assignment...

451
00:47:12,472 --> 00:47:15,507
I pretended my plane was broken.

452
00:47:17,176 --> 00:47:18,813
I took a detour...

453
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,230
and landed on Odo Island.

454
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,872
These pictures...

455
00:47:37,797 --> 00:47:41,898
belonged to the mechanics on the island.

456
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:47,567
They all died.

457
00:48:01,561 --> 00:48:03,033
That night...

458
00:48:04,373 --> 00:48:07,638
a dinosaur-like monster came ashore.

459
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:12,754
I was asked...

460
00:48:13,494 --> 00:48:16,567
to shoot it with the gun on my fighter.

461
00:48:19,327 --> 00:48:21,626
But I froze up...

462
00:48:26,127 --> 00:48:28,349
and fled once more.

463
00:48:29,586 --> 00:48:32,874
When I came the next day...

464
00:48:34,058 --> 00:48:38,216
I found them all dead.
People longing to see their families!

465
00:48:43,048 --> 00:48:45,169
They called the monster...

466
00:48:47,286 --> 00:48:49,597
Godzilla.

467
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:56,740
The other day, it reappeared.

468
00:48:59,655 --> 00:49:01,592
And once again...

469
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:05,973
I couldn't do anything.

470
00:49:15,227 --> 00:49:16,992
I'm someone...

471
00:49:18,618 --> 00:49:21,366
who wasn't supposed to live.

472
00:49:27,889 --> 00:49:29,706
Listen to me.

473
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:35,772
Everyone who survived the war
is meant to live.

474
00:49:35,797 --> 00:49:39,012
- How do you know?
- I just do!

475
00:49:39,888 --> 00:49:43,938
As flames took past, my parents,
they ordered me to live.

476
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:48,780
So whatever happens next,
I know I must survive!

477
00:49:50,129 --> 00:49:52,118
That's kept me going.

478
00:50:04,273 --> 00:50:05,737
I can't.

479
00:50:08,483 --> 00:50:12,505
They beckon to me in my dreams every night.

480
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:15,193
“Hurry and come,” they say.

481
00:50:15,741 --> 00:50:18,957
"Why are you still cheating death?"

482
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:23,454
It's just a dream, ghosts you created.

483
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:25,664
Maybe it's an illusion.

484
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:29,568
What if I'm really dead already?

485
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:33,841
I died long ago on that island...

486
00:50:34,224 --> 00:50:36,338
and lie rotting.

487
00:50:36,363 --> 00:50:42,503
You and Akiko are just the last
dream of a dead man.

488
00:50:42,765 --> 00:50:45,325
That must be it! It has to be!

489
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,285
You are still alive!

490
00:50:51,393 --> 00:50:53,760
You're alive, Koichi.

491
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,513
Can't you feel it?

492
00:51:13,056 --> 00:51:16,395
Okay, hold the spoon.

493
00:51:16,548 --> 00:51:19,579
Careful, careful.

494
00:51:19,937 --> 00:51:22,246
- Hold it tight.
- Okay.

495
00:51:22,943 --> 00:51:27,754
Good, now stir the broth.
You're doing great!

496
00:51:28,475 --> 00:51:31,655
- There, it's done!
- Yeah!

497
00:51:32,451 --> 00:51:35,222
I added your favorite, radish.

498
00:51:35,303 --> 00:51:37,549
- Radish!
- Taste it for me.

499
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:39,846
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

500
00:51:42,345 --> 00:51:44,940
First the soup, then the radish.

501
00:51:57,386 --> 00:51:58,882
Can I...

502
00:52:00,885 --> 00:52:03,008
put this all to rest?

503
00:52:09,906 --> 00:52:12,144
I'd like to try to live again.

504
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,876
Is it what I think it is?

505
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:36,661
Hurry and report it.

506
00:52:37,573 --> 00:52:39,125
Hurry up!

507
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:40,438
Yes, sir!

508
00:53:00,854 --> 00:53:05,660
Patrols report the Creature is
heading east towards Tokyo Bay.

509
00:53:05,922 --> 00:53:07,943
Is it close then?

510
00:53:10,124 --> 00:53:12,131
- What is it?
- I don't believe it.

511
00:53:12,156 --> 00:53:13,692
Is it here?

512
00:53:13,756 --> 00:53:16,714
- Is that really a living thing?
- Oh, yeah.

513
00:53:18,658 --> 00:53:23,992
This is Tokyo Bay Defense,
requesting permission to detonate Zone 4!

514
00:53:24,104 --> 00:53:26,206
It's getting closer.

515
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:32,297
Entering Zone 4!

516
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,950
- Now!
- Detonate!

517
00:53:37,788 --> 00:53:38,972
Status?

518
00:53:39,786 --> 00:53:40,819
Nothing.

519
00:53:40,911 --> 00:53:42,797
It had no effect at all.

520
00:53:42,857 --> 00:53:46,802
Blockade breached!
It's heading to Shinagawa!

521
00:53:46,827 --> 00:53:48,917
And it's gigantic!

522
00:53:52,131 --> 00:53:53,318
Ups.

523
00:53:54,274 --> 00:53:56,306
So.

524
00:54:08,567 --> 00:54:12,339
It's an emergency message!

525
00:54:12,364 --> 00:54:16,740
A giant sea monster has landed at Ginza!

526
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:22,041
Those near Ginza,
follow police instructions and evacuate.

527
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:24,334
- It's serious.
- Ginza.

528
00:54:31,395 --> 00:54:33,681
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

529
00:55:08,008 --> 00:55:10,580
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

530
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:32,088
Is that... Godzilla?

531
00:56:49,983 --> 00:56:55,390
It's a scene that defies belief,
a giant creature on the loose...

532
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:58,282
trampling Ginza underfoot!

533
00:56:59,298 --> 00:57:02,133
Tearing whole buildings apart!

534
00:57:02,314 --> 00:57:06,588
The Nippon Theater,
a beloved icon of the people...

535
00:57:06,739 --> 00:57:09,281
is crumbling before our very eyes!

536
00:57:10,146 --> 00:57:15,251
The Ginza survived the air raids
but not this! This monster...

537
00:57:15,276 --> 00:57:17,550
has turned it to rubble!

538
00:57:17,575 --> 00:57:21,515
And now the monster is coming this way!

539
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:26,694
I can see its enormous head
passing in front of us!

540
00:57:27,025 --> 00:57:29,989
It's dangerously close!

541
00:57:53,653 --> 00:57:55,093
Move!

542
00:58:03,721 --> 00:58:05,165
Get up!

543
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,370
- Koichi!
- Do you want to live? Come on!

544
00:58:51,916 --> 00:58:53,758
Did they get it?

545
00:59:36,505 --> 00:59:38,337
It is...

546
00:59:38,868 --> 00:59:40,571
exactly like then.

547
01:00:34,354 --> 01:00:35,492
Noriko.

548
01:00:37,936 --> 01:00:39,315
Noriko!

549
01:00:41,466 --> 01:00:43,351
N-Nori...

550
01:02:19,514 --> 01:02:22,451
Damage wreaked by the giant creature...

551
01:02:22,483 --> 01:02:25,483
includes some 30,000 killed and injured...

552
01:02:25,514 --> 01:02:28,696
20,000 homes and buildings were destroyed.

553
01:02:28,987 --> 01:02:34,029
Recovery operations are underway,
but the path the creature took...

554
01:02:34,054 --> 01:02:37,630
carries the risk of radiation that
is impeding progress.

555
01:02:37,836 --> 01:02:43,533
Police have cordoned off central Ginza
to collect shards of the creature...

556
01:02:43,765 --> 01:02:49,599
which are of unknown composition
and potentially hazardous.

557
01:03:04,605 --> 01:03:06,522
I'm so sorry.

558
01:03:11,575 --> 01:03:13,582
What are you doing now with Akiko?

559
01:03:15,343 --> 01:03:18,227
We have to support each other, we have to.

560
01:03:18,757 --> 01:03:19,921
Hey, Akiko.

561
01:03:22,777 --> 01:03:28,077
You like playing with me when
Father's away at work, right?

562
01:03:28,506 --> 01:03:30,485
Where's Mommy?

563
01:03:36,591 --> 01:03:41,712
Mom had to go away for her work.

564
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:44,601
But I'm here with you, right?

565
01:04:31,669 --> 01:04:34,899
You can't forgive me, can you?

566
01:04:41,638 --> 01:04:43,434
It's my fault...

567
01:04:44,585 --> 01:04:47,241
for thinking I could dream again.

568
01:05:01,502 --> 01:05:02,752
Mr. Shikishima.

569
01:05:04,336 --> 01:05:10,120
There's actually a strategy being hatched
to defeat Godzilla...

570
01:05:11,646 --> 01:05:13,687
led by private citizens.

571
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:17,177
It lacks any real basis
for viability, but...

572
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:22,133
will you take part?

573
01:05:28,274 --> 01:05:31,509
<b>"Special Disaster Countermeasure Hearing"</b>

574
01:05:37,228 --> 01:05:40,654
- Wait, everyone here is...
- Yes.

575
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:43,612
- Ex-navy personnel.
- You're informed.

576
01:05:43,895 --> 01:05:45,385
Really?

577
01:06:03,901 --> 01:06:08,343
I'm ex-"Yukikaze" Destroyer Captain Hotta.

578
01:06:08,856 --> 01:06:12,040
As you all know, Tokyo again faces...

579
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:16,639
an unprecedented crisis,
this time, a monster attack.

580
01:06:16,948 --> 01:06:22,170
But we have no defense apparatus
of our own to protect our people.

581
01:06:22,364 --> 01:06:27,604
What's more, any GHQ-led military
action runs the risk of escalating

582
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:30,366
US-Soviet tensions.

583
01:06:30,617 --> 01:06:36,224
In short, we must confront the monsters
with our strengths as private citizens.

584
01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:40,768
This is why we've gathered you here.

585
01:06:41,125 --> 01:06:44,642
But we've negotiated the
use of four destroyers...

586
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,138
originally slated for handover to the UN.

587
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,422
Are you saying...

588
01:06:51,756 --> 01:06:54,146
you want us back on navy ships?

589
01:06:54,185 --> 01:06:58,390
I saw what it did in Ginza.
There's no way to defeat it.

590
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:02,765
Especially from boats
that have been disarmed.

591
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:05,246
You're dreaming!

592
01:07:05,345 --> 01:07:08,733
That is what I would like to explain,
if you will allow me.

593
01:07:08,957 --> 01:07:10,791
Mr. Noda?

594
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:12,745
The plan...

595
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:16,816
Pardon me.

596
01:07:17,604 --> 01:07:22,572
The plan was drafted by me,
Kenji Noda, ex-Navy technical officer.

597
01:07:22,687 --> 01:07:25,017
The first thing to know...

598
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:30,227
is that this creature the people
of Odo Island called “Godzilla”...

599
01:07:30,298 --> 01:07:33,714
cannot be hurt by conventional firearms.

600
01:07:33,859 --> 01:07:39,140
I saw it take heavy artillery fire
from the guns of Takao...

601
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,443
but quickly heal itself.

602
01:07:43,718 --> 01:07:45,284
Quiet, please.

603
01:07:45,309 --> 01:07:48,288
So we need a totally different approach.

604
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:53,115
Let me give you a demonstration.

605
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:56,163
This is concentrated salt water.

606
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:01,884
This wood model is weighted down
just enough to barely float.

607
01:08:01,909 --> 01:08:06,696
What happens if we pipe in freon gas,
enveloping it in bubbles?

608
01:08:06,871 --> 01:08:11,070
That's easy. Bubbles or not,
it would stay afloat.

609
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:15,540
That's what you'd think.

610
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:23,107
It sinks!

611
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:29,618
The freon bubbles prevent the model
from seawater contact.

612
01:08:29,803 --> 01:08:35,525
My idea is to entrap Godzilla like this
and sink it to the ocean floor.

613
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:39,982
Did you have any idea Doc was
such a bigwig?

614
01:08:40,137 --> 01:08:41,327
No.

615
01:08:53,912 --> 01:08:56,651
At over 1500 meters in depth...

616
01:08:56,676 --> 01:09:00,992
the Sagami Trench is the deepest
place in nearby waters.

617
01:09:01,121 --> 01:09:06,634
The plan is to strap freon cylinders
to Godzilla and let them foam.

618
01:09:06,659 --> 01:09:08,728
We create a bubble membrane.

619
01:09:08,753 --> 01:09:13,575
It'll sink so rapidly that
the pressure will crush it.

620
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:19,544
We kill it with the power of the sea.

621
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:23,943
That's the outline for
Operation Wada Tsumi.

622
01:09:24,758 --> 01:09:28,727
It's of the sea.
Won't it withstand the pressure?

623
01:09:30,039 --> 01:09:36,373
After 25 seconds, every square
meter applies 1,500 tons of pressure.

624
01:09:36,656 --> 01:09:42,069
Even ocean-born creatures cannot
bear such rapid pressure change.

625
01:09:42,228 --> 01:09:44,000
Can you promise...

626
01:09:44,214 --> 01:09:46,817
that would kill Godzilla?

627
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:51,740
Godzilla is an unknown organism.

628
01:09:52,216 --> 01:09:54,731
We can only guess what will happen.

629
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:01,067
But it is our best alternative.

630
01:10:01,092 --> 01:10:03,494
Will it kill it?
Or will it not?

631
01:10:06,294 --> 01:10:08,453
I can't absolutely guarantee it.

632
01:10:10,889 --> 01:10:13,909
- Shikishima!
- It is possible that it can succeed!

633
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,064
Mr. Shikishima.

634
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,814
Hear me out, please.

635
01:10:40,215 --> 01:10:43,097
Now let's get to the details.

636
01:10:47,965 --> 01:10:51,975
Two ships will corral Godzilla
and wrap it in cable.

637
01:10:52,935 --> 01:10:58,738
The cable will have multiple
freon gas cylinders attached to it.

638
01:11:00,894 --> 01:11:04,619
The gas will be released as it's being tied.

639
01:11:05,423 --> 01:11:09,506
And Godzilla will take a rapid
plunge of 1,500 meters.

640
01:11:09,894 --> 01:11:13,025
- What if the plan fails?
- There is a plan B.

641
01:11:14,286 --> 01:11:17,242
Look into the courtyard.

642
01:11:35,844 --> 01:11:37,920
We raise it from the bottom of the sea!

643
01:11:42,361 --> 01:11:44,961
I'm Itagaki of Toyo Balloon Company.

644
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:48,763
What you just saw...
is an inflatable levitation device

645
01:11:48,788 --> 01:11:52,475
like the kind used in navy aircraft.

646
01:11:52,765 --> 01:11:58,051
CO2 is shot into air sacs for buoyancy.
It's a life preserver.

647
01:11:59,841 --> 01:12:01,922
When Godzilla lands on the ocean floor…

648
01:12:01,947 --> 01:12:05,285
We raise it quickly back up to the surface.

649
01:12:05,593 --> 01:12:11,868
If it bears the pressure,
it'll then contend massive decompression.

650
01:12:12,136 --> 01:12:16,199
I can't say for sure if it will survive the pressure...

651
01:12:16,502 --> 01:12:18,933
but we must try every possibility.

652
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,751
You've all survived a tragic war.

653
01:12:26,986 --> 01:12:32,012
So it pains me to ask you again
to put your lives on the line.

654
01:12:32,187 --> 01:12:35,004
But I hope you understand...

655
01:12:35,108 --> 01:12:38,942
We can't rely on the US
or the Japanese government.

656
01:12:38,967 --> 01:12:42,166
So the future of this country is in our hands.

657
01:12:45,224 --> 01:12:47,068
I can't do it.

658
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:50,374
I have a family.

659
01:12:50,472 --> 01:12:53,927
And that goes for most people here.

660
01:12:54,059 --> 01:12:58,007
Why are we always the ones
drawing the short straw?

661
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,958
We got enough of that in the war.

662
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:10,652
Please.

663
01:13:10,716 --> 01:13:12,670
I beg you to listen very carefully.

664
01:13:12,895 --> 01:13:18,423
This is not an order.
You're all free to leave if you wish.

665
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:22,273
We have no right to stop you.

666
01:13:46,516 --> 01:13:48,318
This plan...

667
01:13:49,143 --> 01:13:51,174
does it mean certain death?

668
01:13:52,218 --> 01:13:53,771
Of course not.

669
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:59,072
Then it's not as bad as a war.

670
01:14:02,117 --> 01:14:03,964
It can't be helped.

671
01:14:04,904 --> 01:14:06,750
Someone has to do it.

672
01:14:06,882 --> 01:14:09,308
Who can sail the ships if not us?

673
01:14:09,459 --> 01:14:11,001
That's right.

674
01:14:11,691 --> 01:14:15,141
- So what? Shall we do it, boys?
- Yes!

675
01:14:23,895 --> 01:14:25,319
My friends...

676
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:28,908
thank you.

677
01:14:29,323 --> 01:14:31,008
Hear, hear!

678
01:14:38,423 --> 01:14:43,455
What a surprise, to find you're
the mastermind of such a grand plan.

679
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:46,692
Well, I've had a direct encounter.

680
01:14:46,852 --> 01:14:49,397
So the task fell to me.

681
01:14:49,469 --> 01:14:52,862
And we were called for the same reasons.

682
01:14:53,037 --> 01:14:55,967
Do you think Godzilla will return?

683
01:14:57,438 --> 01:15:00,459
I think we can assume that Godzilla…

684
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:03,640
has incorporated Tokyo into its territory.

685
01:15:03,692 --> 01:15:08,484
I expect it to return in 10 days at the latest.

686
01:15:08,794 --> 01:15:10,063
That soon?

687
01:15:10,095 --> 01:15:13,001
Did you set up radiation detection boys?

688
01:15:13,067 --> 01:15:16,286
Visual detection isn't enough.

689
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:20,780
How can you expect it to
walk right into your trap?

690
01:15:20,955 --> 01:15:23,443
- I can't.
- What, no plan?

691
01:15:23,537 --> 01:15:27,176
Who do you think I am?
Of course, I have a plan.

692
01:15:29,615 --> 01:15:32,720
We have acoustic minesweepers.

693
01:15:32,838 --> 01:15:37,374
We use speakers to play
a recording of Godzilla's voice.

694
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:39,444
- Its voice?
- Yeah.

695
01:15:39,469 --> 01:15:44,055
It sees it as another territorial competitor.

696
01:15:44,672 --> 01:15:46,547
- Hopefully.
- Hopefully?

697
01:15:46,605 --> 01:15:48,407
You don't sound very convincing.

698
01:15:48,432 --> 01:15:51,571
And that levitation device?

699
01:15:51,596 --> 01:15:54,564
I can't envision that working well.

700
01:15:54,589 --> 01:15:56,584
Any other ideas, then?

701
01:15:56,789 --> 01:16:00,190
I know!
We pull it up with the destroyers.

702
01:16:00,215 --> 01:16:05,891
Godzilla weighs some 20,000 tons.
Too heavy for two destroyers.

703
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:08,427
Oh.

704
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:11,966
In short, your plan is full of holes.

705
01:16:12,974 --> 01:16:16,831
If you have a better one, let's hear it.

706
01:16:19,008 --> 01:16:20,317
Mr. Noda.

707
01:16:22,095 --> 01:16:25,782
Can we get hold of a fighter plane?

708
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,734
A fighter plane?

709
01:16:27,908 --> 01:16:32,738
I could anger it with gunfire
and draw it to Sagami Bay.

710
01:16:32,936 --> 01:16:36,245
All planes were decommissioned.

711
01:16:36,389 --> 01:16:39,888
Even if you could, it shoots a heat ray.

712
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:43,234
You risk your life flying so close.

713
01:16:43,259 --> 01:16:45,255
I'll take that risk.

714
01:16:45,281 --> 01:16:48,743
A fighter jet is more nimble than a boat.

715
01:16:48,768 --> 01:16:53,140
You don't want to crash, do you?

716
01:16:53,671 --> 01:16:55,566
Do you have a death wish?

717
01:16:57,042 --> 01:17:01,052
- You're drunk.
- You just want to avenge Noriko.

718
01:17:01,981 --> 01:17:05,156
- Is it a problem?
- It is too late.

719
01:17:07,339 --> 01:17:10,443
You should have married her.

720
01:17:11,134 --> 01:17:15,985
- You knew how she felt about you.
- Don't you think I would like to?

721
01:17:16,942 --> 01:17:19,121
Then why didn't you do it?

722
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,534
Because...

723
01:17:28,678 --> 01:17:31,558
my war isn't over yet.

724
01:17:56,217 --> 01:17:58,621
- Have you found a plane?
- Yes.

725
01:17:58,698 --> 01:18:00,861
But it's a unique one.

726
01:18:20,075 --> 01:18:25,117
It was developed at the end of the war,
Local Fighter Shinden.

727
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:28,954
Designed to shoot down bombers.

728
01:18:28,979 --> 01:18:31,361
It could fly at a speed of over 400 knots.

729
01:18:31,643 --> 01:18:36,695
It's got a tail wing,
four 30 mm guns, and it's nimble as hell.

730
01:18:36,893 --> 01:18:40,039
It's a plane full of innovations.

731
01:18:41,122 --> 01:18:45,122
Only a few prototypes were field deployed.

732
01:18:45,331 --> 01:18:51,981
They were kept here for
a mainland battle that never came.

733
01:18:52,422 --> 01:18:56,411
They were left to rust,
and are in bad shape.

734
01:18:57,670 --> 01:19:00,295
It's not air-worthy as is.

735
01:19:00,438 --> 01:19:03,281
What we need is a top mechanic.

736
01:19:03,306 --> 01:19:07,317
Someone who knows their
way around a jet fighter.

737
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:13,562
I know the right person.

738
01:19:15,937 --> 01:19:18,759
Ex-Odo Island detachment mechanic.

739
01:19:18,819 --> 01:19:21,226
- Sosaku Tachibana.
- Exactly.

740
01:19:21,251 --> 01:19:24,271
Tachibana, Tachibana, Tachibana.

741
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:28,281
No known current address.

742
01:19:28,306 --> 01:19:32,415
- I'm sorry.
- We're swamped with search requests.

743
01:19:32,461 --> 01:19:34,786
It will take a long time.

744
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:37,503
I have to find him.

745
01:19:37,642 --> 01:19:40,428
So does everybody.

746
01:19:40,516 --> 01:19:42,711
- I'm begging you!
- What?

747
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:45,371
The country's future depends on it!

748
01:19:45,464 --> 01:19:49,564
I'm sure,
but I can't do the impossible.

749
01:19:49,589 --> 01:19:51,464
Well then...

750
01:19:51,589 --> 01:19:56,558
Where was he posted before Odo Island?

751
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:06,071
I've asked everywhere.

752
01:20:06,281 --> 01:20:10,248
But this Tachibana probably
doesn't want to be found.

753
01:20:11,329 --> 01:20:14,149
We can find another mechanic.

754
01:20:14,334 --> 01:20:18,303
- Do you have other options?
- Wait just a moment.

755
01:20:19,637 --> 01:20:22,189
Why does it have to be him?

756
01:20:22,446 --> 01:20:26,477
- Godzilla could be here any minute.
- It must be Tachibana!

757
01:20:27,063 --> 01:20:29,460
He's going to get my message.

758
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:32,489
Please!

759
01:20:58,597 --> 01:21:00,336
Tachibana.

760
01:21:01,422 --> 01:21:04,948
Mr. Tachibana! It's really you!

761
01:21:08,939 --> 01:21:10,887
What is it about?

762
01:21:14,532 --> 01:21:15,601
Wait.

763
01:21:17,993 --> 01:21:22,599
The Odo Island massacre was all my fault?!

764
01:21:24,654 --> 01:21:26,396
Are you serious?

765
01:21:27,089 --> 01:21:28,336
I'm sorry.

766
01:21:29,161 --> 01:21:34,478
I knew if I angered you,
you'd come to find me.

767
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,564
How dare you?

768
01:21:38,451 --> 01:21:40,431
The attack on Ginza...

769
01:21:41,523 --> 01:21:43,229
similar to that of Odo Island.

770
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,875
It was Godzilla.

771
01:21:53,824 --> 01:21:57,598
I need you to repair
a fighter for me.

772
01:21:57,773 --> 01:21:59,856
so I can kill that monster!

773
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,357
I needed to find you,
to ask for your help.

774
01:22:05,744 --> 01:22:08,768
That's why I wrote those letters.

775
01:22:10,364 --> 01:22:11,977
Please forgive me!

776
01:22:17,595 --> 01:22:19,422
You're on your own.

777
01:22:20,406 --> 01:22:22,616
I'm not helping you.

778
01:22:22,919 --> 01:22:26,225
No, wait, Mr. Tachibana!

779
01:22:26,574 --> 01:22:31,032
Please listen to me!
I need your help killing Godzilla.

780
01:22:31,325 --> 01:22:35,258
It's something only you can do.

781
01:22:36,914 --> 01:22:41,667
I burst a mine in its mouth,
and hurt it more than ship guns.

782
01:22:41,692 --> 01:22:45,032
It's vulnerable from the inside.
Do you get me?

783
01:22:46,934 --> 01:22:48,696
You don't mean...

784
01:22:49,489 --> 01:22:55,558
I can kill it if I fly a plane full of
explosives into its mouth.

785
01:23:01,697 --> 01:23:03,087
Kamikaze...

786
01:23:05,448 --> 01:23:07,704
The war isn't over...

787
01:23:10,187 --> 01:23:12,219
for you, either.

788
01:23:15,348 --> 01:23:19,343
- You got that injury falling down?
- Ow.

789
01:23:19,496 --> 01:23:23,036
It's swelling up like a grapefruit.

790
01:23:23,327 --> 01:23:26,280
It's embarrassing, but I was drunk.

791
01:23:26,357 --> 01:23:28,378
I don't quite remember what happened.

792
01:23:28,502 --> 01:23:33,575
I guess you deserved to celebrate
after finding Mr. Tachibana.

793
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:36,914
Tail wing, huh?

794
01:23:37,967 --> 01:23:40,831
I'd heard rumors,
but they actually did it.

795
01:23:42,882 --> 01:23:44,651
Mr. Tachibana.

796
01:23:44,839 --> 01:23:47,171
Thank you all for coming!

797
01:23:47,282 --> 01:23:49,313
You're Mr. Tachibana?

798
01:23:52,803 --> 01:23:57,300
So this is the phantom
Local Fighter Shinden, huh?

799
01:23:57,554 --> 01:24:00,355
Can you make this fly?

800
01:24:03,547 --> 01:24:05,790
We'll do all we can.

801
01:24:06,324 --> 01:24:07,683
Thank you.

802
01:24:08,911 --> 01:24:11,765
Good luck. Good luck.

803
01:24:29,636 --> 01:24:31,386
What's wrong?

804
01:24:31,505 --> 01:24:34,589
Brighten up, Mastermind.
It's bad for morale.

805
01:24:35,052 --> 01:24:37,021
I know that's my plan.

806
01:24:37,046 --> 01:24:41,046
But I'm feeling we'll need
a miracle to make it work.

807
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:45,763
Doing nothing won't cause
a miracle, either.

808
01:24:46,167 --> 01:24:47,917
You're right.

809
01:24:48,064 --> 01:24:51,183
Take a look at these guys' faces.

810
01:24:52,549 --> 01:24:54,367
They are not stupid.

811
01:24:54,457 --> 01:24:57,642
They know they're risking their lives.

812
01:24:58,402 --> 01:24:59,808
And yet...

813
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:03,914
Their faces are beaming.

814
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:08,850
They are happy.
This time they will make a difference.

815
01:25:10,184 --> 01:25:12,610
Make a difference.

816
01:25:14,195 --> 01:25:16,942
We have all experienced the war.

817
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:20,839
This time we make sure to win.

818
01:25:33,063 --> 01:25:36,055
<b>"2 Floor Conference Room 3,
Special Disaster Countermeasure HQ"</b>

819
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,902
Hurry up!

820
01:25:40,598 --> 01:25:42,031
Make room!

821
01:25:43,087 --> 01:25:46,604
One hour ago, east of Hachijo Island...

822
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,903
33.10 north, 140.01 east...

823
01:25:51,113 --> 01:25:54,546
We got Geiger readings from multiple buoys.

824
01:25:55,175 --> 01:25:56,613
Followed by...

825
01:25:56,638 --> 01:25:58,840
here and here.

826
01:26:14,234 --> 01:26:16,096
Godzilla is coming.

827
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:18,196
At last.

828
01:26:18,221 --> 01:26:23,453
At this rate, it's due to
arrive over the Sagami Trench...

829
01:26:23,628 --> 01:26:26,331
at 1100 hours tomorrow, which means...

830
01:26:26,375 --> 01:26:30,671
We have to mobilize
and be in positions by 0800.

831
01:26:32,504 --> 01:26:33,597
But tell me...

832
01:26:33,951 --> 01:26:36,672
will your device be ready by then?

833
01:26:37,763 --> 01:26:39,721
Take us with you.

834
01:26:39,839 --> 01:26:44,183
The final 3 hours will be critical.
We want it perfect.

835
01:26:44,229 --> 01:26:48,150
But you could get caught in the fight.

836
01:26:48,743 --> 01:26:50,967
We've all seen war, too.

837
01:26:56,704 --> 01:27:03,419
Then everybody, go home tonight.
Spend the time with your families.

838
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:07,599
You mean... be prepared?

839
01:27:12,005 --> 01:27:13,869
Come to think of it...

840
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:18,841
this country has treated life
far too cheaply.

841
01:27:19,966 --> 01:27:22,177
Poorly armored tanks.

842
01:27:22,942 --> 01:27:25,176
Bad supply lines that resulted in…

843
01:27:25,201 --> 01:27:29,088
that half of all deaths were due to hunger and disease.

844
01:27:30,462 --> 01:27:35,524
Fighter planes built without
ejection seats.

845
01:27:37,132 --> 01:27:41,351
And finally, kamikaze
and suicide attacks.

846
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:45,501
That's why this time.....

847
01:27:46,975 --> 01:27:49,860
I'd take pride in a citizen-led effort...

848
01:27:51,362 --> 01:27:54,447
that sacrifices no lives at all!

849
01:27:56,661 --> 01:27:58,431
This next battle...

850
01:27:59,118 --> 01:28:01,181
is not one waged to the death.

851
01:28:02,472 --> 01:28:05,035
But a battle to live for the future.

852
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:13,669
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

853
01:28:17,984 --> 01:28:20,289
Finally, tomorrow's the day.

854
01:28:20,314 --> 01:28:23,059
- I can't wait.
- You're not going.

855
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:30,415
What do you mean?
You are of no use with that hand.

856
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,592
Even Shikishima's going!

857
01:28:32,951 --> 01:28:35,177
Is it because I haven't been a soldier?

858
01:28:35,332 --> 01:28:37,172
I can be of use.

859
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:40,243
It is precisely something to be proud of...

860
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:43,008
that you have never been to war.

861
01:28:49,565 --> 01:28:51,863
I also want to defend my country.

862
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:57,427
Take me with you!

863
01:28:59,738 --> 01:29:02,519
We've been a team for a long time!

864
01:29:04,337 --> 01:29:06,142
You don't want enough!

865
01:29:06,806 --> 01:29:09,047
Take me with you!

866
01:29:09,072 --> 01:29:10,946
I want to join!

867
01:29:10,971 --> 01:29:13,563
We make sure you have a future.

868
01:29:13,661 --> 01:29:15,229
Captured!

869
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:17,119
Mr. Noda!

870
01:29:28,355 --> 01:29:29,926
A little lower.

871
01:29:30,585 --> 01:29:31,839
Careful.

872
01:29:47,462 --> 01:29:50,462
Here you go, Akiko.

873
01:29:59,014 --> 01:30:01,736
I want to...

874
01:30:02,486 --> 01:30:04,156
thank you for everything.

875
01:30:17,182 --> 01:30:18,837
Akiko.

876
01:30:19,369 --> 01:30:21,103
Was it fun at Auntie's?

877
01:30:21,128 --> 01:30:22,624
It was fun.

878
01:30:22,649 --> 01:30:25,166
Good. I'm glad.

879
01:30:29,609 --> 01:30:31,442
Is it for me?

880
01:30:32,657 --> 01:30:34,093
Thank you.

881
01:30:39,545 --> 01:30:41,666
- Akiko.
- Yes.

882
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:46,030
Is this you, me and mom?

883
01:30:47,315 --> 01:30:49,756
That's mom there.

884
01:30:50,733 --> 01:30:52,032
I see.

885
01:30:53,302 --> 01:30:55,218
It's really good.

886
01:31:05,589 --> 01:31:07,874
Why do you look so sad?

887
01:31:12,727 --> 01:31:14,384
What's wrong?

888
01:31:14,409 --> 01:31:15,824
Akiko.

889
01:31:16,437 --> 01:31:18,371
There there.

890
01:31:20,483 --> 01:31:25,414
It'll be all right.
I'm not leaving you.

891
01:32:41,877 --> 01:32:43,354
Mr. Tachibana.

892
01:32:45,056 --> 01:32:46,961
It is ready?

893
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:51,700
Give me a minute.

894
01:33:03,262 --> 01:33:05,263
The bomb you ordered.

895
01:33:06,257 --> 01:33:10,660
Two machine guns,
140 kg... 120 rounds, 80 kg...

896
01:33:10,975 --> 01:33:13,700
And one main fuel tank,
400 kg removed.

897
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:18,806
Instead, a No. 25 bomb in the nose,
and No. 50 in the fuselage.

898
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:23,277
Now, I can finally pay them back.

899
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,284
That's funny.

900
01:33:43,459 --> 01:33:45,547
Part of me wants to live.

901
01:33:50,214 --> 01:33:52,881
Like all those men back then.

902
01:33:53,897 --> 01:33:55,949
They wanted to go home to their families.

903
01:33:57,449 --> 01:34:02,856
But instead,
they got squashed like bugs.

904
01:34:05,007 --> 01:34:06,876
I understand you.

905
01:34:29,324 --> 01:34:31,991
This was drawn by a girl named Akiko.

906
01:34:33,718 --> 01:34:36,025
I want to protect her future.

907
01:34:40,251 --> 01:34:43,901
I will stop Godzilla no matter what.

908
01:34:44,758 --> 01:34:47,195
You're finally ready.

909
01:34:49,169 --> 01:34:52,978
Then, this is important.

910
01:34:53,732 --> 01:34:55,227
Look here.

911
01:34:56,194 --> 01:34:58,277
The bomb's safety pin.

912
01:34:58,782 --> 01:35:00,949
Pull it out before flying in.

913
01:35:00,974 --> 01:35:02,258
Got it?

914
01:35:03,754 --> 01:35:05,374
One last thing.

915
01:35:15,307 --> 01:35:16,872
Akiko.

916
01:35:18,687 --> 01:35:21,438
Are you all by yourself?

917
01:35:22,403 --> 01:35:23,892
Look here.

918
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:32,713
“To Sumiko...”

919
01:35:44,338 --> 01:35:48,647
"Look after Akiko.
Use this money for her."

920
01:35:56,558 --> 01:35:59,122
From Daddy?

921
01:35:59,888 --> 01:36:02,880
Huh? Yeah, from Daddy.

922
01:36:04,344 --> 01:36:07,457
It's all right.
Don't worry.

923
01:36:23,968 --> 01:36:28,677
This is Kuroshio 12, 35.03 N, 139.41 E.

924
01:36:28,702 --> 01:36:30,596
Many deep sea fish were found!

925
01:36:49,177 --> 01:36:57,123
Godzilla is sighted in Sagami Bay!
Underwater guidance decoy activated.

926
01:36:58,188 --> 01:37:01,858
Take only the essentials with you!

927
01:37:01,975 --> 01:37:03,764
Get on board quickly.

928
01:37:03,789 --> 01:37:05,589
Let's speed up!

929
01:37:07,008 --> 01:37:10,554
- Mizushima took our advice?
- It's the best thing for him.

930
01:37:10,579 --> 01:37:13,390
I didn't want Shikishima to fly either.

931
01:37:13,565 --> 01:37:17,052
A failed kamikaze pilot?
It worries me.

932
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:20,350
He's got Akiko.
He'll make it back alive.

933
01:37:29,025 --> 01:37:33,080
The underwater decoy team was destroyed!

934
01:37:33,105 --> 01:37:38,285
Godzilla has entered Sagami Bay!
Wada Tsumi ships, leave port now!

935
01:37:39,073 --> 01:37:40,284
Look.

936
01:37:41,154 --> 01:37:42,298
There!

937
01:37:42,488 --> 01:37:44,558
It's already here.

938
01:37:55,407 --> 01:37:59,283
Godzilla's through the final defense line!
Heading for shore!

939
01:38:00,383 --> 01:38:01,521
I'm off!

940
01:38:56,103 --> 01:39:00,694
Time to end it once and for all, Shikishima.

941
01:39:01,464 --> 01:39:08,496
Leave port now! Repeat.
Wada Tsumi ships leave port now!

942
01:39:14,518 --> 01:39:17,676
What now?
The plan's ruined!

943
01:39:17,893 --> 01:39:19,911
We board anyway.

944
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:24,792
We need to sink it over the Sagami Trench
or it won't work.

945
01:39:25,066 --> 01:39:28,385
Shikishima will have to lure it!

946
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:30,489
- Come on!
- We are going!

947
01:39:46,749 --> 01:39:49,167
Radio from Mr. Shikishima!

948
01:39:50,832 --> 01:39:55,582
I'm in the air preparing to lure
Godzilla to target area.

949
01:39:55,607 --> 01:39:58,972
- We are ready.
- Get there quickly.

950
01:39:58,997 --> 01:40:04,331
Don't do anything rash!
I won't forgive you if you orphan Akiko.

951
01:40:07,155 --> 01:40:09,367
You hear me, Shikishima!

952
01:40:10,842 --> 01:40:13,652
He's ignoring me.

953
01:40:36,041 --> 01:40:37,835
Mail!

954
01:40:38,843 --> 01:40:40,167
Coming.

955
01:40:46,567 --> 01:40:49,290
- Hello? - Ms. Shikishima?

956
01:40:51,464 --> 01:40:53,429
You have a telegram.
- Thanks.

957
01:42:16,951 --> 01:42:20,313
Wow. What a way to lure it away!

958
01:42:20,781 --> 01:42:23,944
Godzilla looks really ticked off.

959
01:42:24,342 --> 01:42:27,511
- It follows him.
- Now it's our turn.

960
01:42:30,670 --> 01:42:34,701
- All ships in battle position!
- All ships in battle position!

961
01:42:37,410 --> 01:42:38,803
Freon cylinders are ready!

962
01:42:38,828 --> 01:42:41,596
46 cm cannonballs ready!
Levitation switch ready!

963
01:42:41,621 --> 01:42:43,223
Cables ready!

964
01:42:43,518 --> 01:42:45,558
All circuits are on!

965
01:42:45,627 --> 01:42:48,469
Turn on the power and
release the safety device!

966
01:43:04,721 --> 01:43:07,403
Fine. Come on.

967
01:43:09,091 --> 01:43:12,831
- Team one attacks as planned.
- As planned!

968
01:43:44,018 --> 01:43:45,976
Atta boy.

969
01:44:22,569 --> 01:44:25,600
That's Godzilla's heat ray.

970
01:44:27,948 --> 01:44:33,097
The ships won't survive this.
All ships must evacuate!

971
01:44:33,122 --> 01:44:36,241
No, this is okay. We stick to the plan.

972
01:44:36,266 --> 01:44:38,356
But the heat ray!

973
01:44:38,381 --> 01:44:42,550
Once fired, it takes time to regenerate.

974
01:44:42,902 --> 01:44:44,378
We go now!

975
01:44:45,289 --> 01:44:47,240
Give the order!

976
01:44:51,929 --> 01:44:54,757
Commence Operation Wada Tsumi!

977
01:45:12,709 --> 01:45:16,888
Fire 46 cm cannonballs,
cylinders and levitation switch!

978
01:45:42,153 --> 01:45:43,873
Shikishima!

979
01:46:09,414 --> 01:46:11,970
- Crane ready!
- Roger!

980
01:46:12,777 --> 01:46:14,969
Hold courses, Hibiki!

981
01:46:15,028 --> 01:46:17,320
Hibiki, maintain course!

982
01:46:17,571 --> 01:46:20,877
Maintain speed, some damage is inevitable.

983
01:46:25,251 --> 01:46:27,983
Hibiki approaching, 4 meters!

984
01:46:28,802 --> 01:46:30,310
2 meter.

985
01:46:30,778 --> 01:46:34,235
- Be prepared for collision!
- Be prepared for collision!

986
01:46:48,489 --> 01:46:51,999
- Crossing complete, Full speed ahead!
- Full speed ahead!

987
01:47:07,873 --> 01:47:10,291
Very good!

988
01:47:11,076 --> 01:47:13,938
- Captain, the switch.
- Roger!

989
01:47:21,775 --> 01:47:23,840
Oh no. Not yet?

990
01:47:25,153 --> 01:47:26,600
Almost.

991
01:47:36,818 --> 01:47:38,904
Ready...

992
01:47:48,367 --> 01:47:50,504
- Hit it, Captain!
- Now!

993
01:47:52,567 --> 01:47:54,510
- Freon!
- Got it!

994
01:48:10,912 --> 01:48:15,468
Depth 1,200 meters!
1,300 meters!

995
01:48:16,071 --> 01:48:18,111
- 1,400 meters!
- Keep going!

996
01:48:18,136 --> 01:48:20,284
- Dive!
- 1,450 meters!

997
01:48:20,995 --> 01:48:25,143
1,500 target passed!

998
01:48:37,136 --> 01:48:39,963
We sunk Godzilla!

999
01:48:40,216 --> 01:48:42,008
Did it succeed?

1000
01:48:49,153 --> 01:48:50,949
Persistent bugger.

1001
01:48:51,379 --> 01:48:53,992
- We'll go to plan B.
- Do it.

1002
01:49:12,481 --> 01:49:14,287
Now rise

1003
01:49:14,748 --> 01:49:19,231
Depth 1,200 meters!
1,100 meters 1,000 meters!

1004
01:49:27,884 --> 01:49:29,662
Cables stopped!

1005
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:32,151
They have stopped at 803 metres!

1006
01:49:33,310 --> 01:49:35,985
Why? What's wrong?

1007
01:49:39,849 --> 01:49:41,887
They are bitten over.

1008
01:49:44,533 --> 01:49:48,772
Hibiki, pull Godzilla up!
90 degrees max speed!

1009
01:49:48,797 --> 01:49:51,792
The two ships lack the thrust.

1010
01:49:51,817 --> 01:49:55,230
We've no choice.
Give it all you can!

1011
01:49:55,469 --> 01:49:56,870
Yes, sir!

1012
01:50:13,293 --> 01:50:15,075
At this rate...

1013
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:16,840
the crane won't hold.

1014
01:50:16,864 --> 01:50:18,442
Get away quickly!

1015
01:50:40,681 --> 01:50:44,962
This is Yokohama tugboat Fujimaru!

1016
01:50:45,146 --> 01:50:49,292
- Doing our best to help!
- That voice there.

1017
01:50:49,935 --> 01:50:52,765
Mizushima here! Are you there, captain?

1018
01:50:53,504 --> 01:50:55,798
Is that you, Kid?

1019
01:50:56,563 --> 01:50:57,880
You bet!

1020
01:50:57,905 --> 01:51:00,604
This is Toyo Kisen's Koeimaru,
here to help.

1021
01:51:00,629 --> 01:51:04,314
And Yokohama Eisen's Nikkomaru!
At your service!

1022
01:51:04,369 --> 01:51:08,060
- Shiokazemaru, assisting!
- Tetsuyumaru.

1023
01:51:08,085 --> 01:51:10,033
- Nanamimaru.
- Minamimaru.

1024
01:51:10,058 --> 01:51:11,593
- Kisshomaru.
- Junseimaru.

1025
01:51:11,618 --> 01:51:13,328
- Wakamaru.
- Heimitsumaru.

1026
01:51:13,353 --> 01:51:14,373
Tenyumaru.

1027
01:51:14,398 --> 01:51:15,896
- Kaiomaru.
- Hyūga.

1028
01:51:15,921 --> 01:51:17,342
- Choukamaru.
- Shuseimaru.

1029
01:51:17,367 --> 01:51:18,827
- Taramaru.
- Yasakamaru.

1030
01:51:19,031 --> 01:51:21,832
The useless to the rescue!

1031
01:51:25,251 --> 01:51:26,950
I'll be damned.

1032
01:51:26,975 --> 01:51:29,944
I gotta admit I'm glad to see him.

1033
01:51:29,969 --> 01:51:33,234
All you tugboats out there!
Let's catch a Godzilla!

1034
01:51:33,662 --> 01:51:37,304
- Everybody pull!
- Everybody pull!

1035
01:52:02,235 --> 01:52:05,256
Godzilla's rising again!

1036
01:52:06,545 --> 01:52:10,048
Come on, show your face!

1037
01:52:10,119 --> 01:52:12,952
Depth 700 meters!

1038
01:52:13,462 --> 01:52:15,543
Keep coming, keep coming!

1039
01:52:46,337 --> 01:52:48,392
It's not damaged enough!

1040
01:52:48,815 --> 01:52:51,214
All ships, get away!

1041
01:53:41,723 --> 01:53:43,447
What's he doing?

1042
01:53:43,472 --> 01:53:44,575
No.

1043
01:53:48,604 --> 01:53:50,604
- Don't.
- Stop!

1044
01:53:50,685 --> 01:53:52,459
Shikishima!

1045
01:54:19,404 --> 01:54:21,043
Shikishima...

1046
01:54:35,844 --> 01:54:37,782
No, look!

1047
01:54:42,163 --> 01:54:43,818
I see him.

1048
01:54:44,918 --> 01:54:46,820
I see him!

1049
01:54:48,832 --> 01:54:52,408
Pilot ejected!
He's alive!

1050
01:55:00,834 --> 01:55:03,714
This seat h

1051
01:55:04,873 --> 01:55:07,171
Just pull that lever.

1052
01:55:10,551 --> 01:55:11,990
Live.

1053
01:55:14,046 --> 01:55:15,725
Mr. Tachibana.

1054
01:56:45,890 --> 01:56:47,776
Shikishima!

1055
01:56:52,530 --> 01:56:54,310
You did it!

1056
01:56:54,612 --> 01:56:56,434
You did it!

1057
01:56:57,863 --> 01:56:59,675
Kid!

1058
01:57:03,147 --> 01:57:05,477
- Sumiko!
- Koichi!

1059
01:57:06,026 --> 01:57:08,657
- Koichi.
- Akiko.

1060
01:57:15,079 --> 01:57:16,475
What?

1061
01:57:57,855 --> 01:57:59,825
Is your war…

1062
01:58:01,868 --> 01:58:03,743
now finally over?

1063
