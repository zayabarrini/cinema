Master, we should go.
It's not good for your health.
I wonder how long I'll be able to make the trip here.
I'd like to settle the score for these children who died while I'm in charge.
I've already received seven cases caused by demons this month.
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps... are on the front lines even as we speak, fighting the demons.
No matter how many lives the demons take... the one thing they can never crush is a human's will.
No matter how battered we are, we will always rise up again to fight.
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!
Are the police still around?
We'll have to go even if they are.
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!
Hey, idiot!
We should go, too!
Hey, don't leave me behind!
W-Wait up!
Tanjiro! Inosuke!
Zenitsu!
So fast!
Sorry! We're very sorry!
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!
So freakin' fast!
Ma'am, is that all right?
Thank you.
Sorry to trouble you.
Oh no.
It's the least I can do.
He's a Hashira, right?
This Rengoku person...
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?
Sure.
He had this gaudy hairstyle, and I remember his scent, too.
Hey!
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.
Delicious!
Delicious!
Delicious!
Delicious!
Delicious!
Delicious!
Delicious!
Delicious!
Delicious!
Delicious!
Delicious!
Delicious!
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?
- Delicious!
- Yeah.
Not just some random glutton?
- Delicious!
- Yeah.
Delicious!
Um, excuse me...
Delicious!
R-Rengoku?
Delicious!
Uh, we really get that part already.
And you're the kid from that day at the Master's.
Yes.
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.
I see. And inside that box there...
Yes.
It's my sister Nezuko.
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.
Have a seat here.
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?
What are you three doing here?
A mission?
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.
Yes! I see now! Understood!
Right.
Also, there's one more thing.
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.
What is it? Let's hear it.
About my father...
What about your father?
Well, he was really frail.
Was he really?
But even if it was cold enough to freeze your lungs, he could still perform a kagura dance in the snow.
Well, I'm glad to hear it!
The thing is...
What's up?
Hinokami Kagura...
Dance!
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura that I'd seen as a child.
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...
I was hoping you'd tell me.
Right!
But I know nothing!
I've never even heard the term "Hinokami Dance" before.
But it's truly commendable that your father was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.
All right, end of discussion!
Um, can you try to help me a little more?
You should become my Tsuguko, my apprentice! I'll look after you!
Hold on a second!
And just what are you looking at?
He's totally weird, all right.
Flame Breathing has a long history.
In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira.
Flame.
Water.
Wind.
Stone.
Thunder. Those are the fundamental breathing techniques.
The other techniques were created as offshoots of those five.
Mist is a fork of Wind.
Young Mizoguchi!
What color is your sword?
My name's Kamado.
And the color is black.
A black sword, huh?
Well, isn't that unfortunate?
For real?
I've never known a swordsman with a black sword that became a Hashira.
On top of that, I hear that they have no clue which style to master.
Come to me, and I'll train you!
You can rest easy now!
No, thank you!
And just what are you looking at?
He's strange, but he seems to be very caring.
And from his scent,
I can pick up his strong sense of justice.
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!
That's dangerous, you idiot!
I'm gonna run outside and race to see who's faster!
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.
You never know when a demon might appear.
You're kidding, right?
Demons show up on this train?
Sure do!
What? They do?
Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here?
Nooo!
I'm getting off!
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.
The Corps sent a few swordsmen, but then they all went silent.
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.
Right, I see!
I'm getting off! I'm getting off!
May I... see your... tickets, please?
What's he doing?
The conductor's going to check your ticket and punch a hole in it.
Here.
What is this?
There's a horrible scent.
Thank you... very much.
Mr. Conductor...
You could get hurt, so please step back.
As this is an emergency, please overlook the fact that I have a sword.
Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body?
I had a hard time detecting you.
But if you bare your fangs at innocent people... my bright red Flame Blade will burn you to the bone!
Flame Breathing...
First Form...
Unknowing Fire!
Amazing.
He sliced off the demon's head with one blow.
There's still one more.
Come with me!
All right!
D-Don't leave me behind!
You will not lay a finger on that man!
Didn't you hear me?
I said I'm your opponent.
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!
All right!
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!
We gotta save the passenger first!
It won't matter once I destroy that thing!
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.
We're good to go now.
Let's finish him off in short order.
Flame Breathing...
Second Form...
Rising Scorching Sun!
Tha...
Tha...
That was awesome, Bro!
Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!
Please make me your apprentice!
Fine by me! I'll make a fine swordsman out of you!
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!
I'll train all of you!
Big Bro Rengoku!
Bro!
- Bro!
- Bro!
Big Bro Rengoku!
I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep!
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!
Please let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter!
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you.
Sure thing.
You did a good job.
Go to sleep.
Have a nice dream where you can meet your family.
Excuse me.
What do you want us to do?
Their slumber will grow deeper in a little while.
Wait here until then.
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.
When you tie the ropes, be careful not to touch their bodies.
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.
Hang on until everything's ready to go... so that you can have blissful dreams.
Okay.
What's going on? What happened?
Calm down.
Calm down.
You have to calm down.
Hey!
It's Big Bro!
Welcome home, Big Bro!
Did you sell the charcoal?
Big Bro?
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
To be able to die while dreaming...
Just how lucky are you?
It doesn't matter how powerful a Demon Slayer you are.
A human's driving force is the heart, the spirit!
All you have to do is destroy the spiritual core.
You can kill them just like that!
All human hearts are the same.
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?
That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about.
Take a deep, slow breath... while you count.
Do that, and you'll fall asleep.
One...
Two...
Three...
Four...
Five...
Six...
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!
What a weirdo!
Oh my, you must be exhausted.
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.
You don't have a fever, do you?
Take it easy and get some rest today, okay?
I'm all right.
Are you sure?
Hey! You come back here!
Gotcha!
What do you think you're doing?
Hey! You stop that right now!
Seems like...
I was having a bad dream or something.
Falling deeper into sleep, deep in their dreams...
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...
And even if a demon comes, deep in their dreams...
Even in the stomach, deep in their dreams...
Looks like fun.
You're starting to have a happy dream, aren't you?
You are falling...
You are falling... into a dream.
It's a deep slumber.
They can... no longer awaken.
This way!
The peaches over here taste great!
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!
I'll make you a chaplet!
I can make these really great-looking ones...
Nezuko!
Yes! Make a lot, okay...
Zenitsu?
There's a river along the way, but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?
River?
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?
I can't swim.
I-I'll just carry you on my back and jump right over the river!
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!
Just leave it to me!
Let's go!
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!
We're the Cave Expedition Team!
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!
We're the Cave Expedition Team!
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!
Boss!
Boss!
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?
I can smell the master of this cave over there, pompoko!
And I can hear it breathing as it sleeps, squeak!
Here he is!
All right, let's go! Showdown!
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!
Come over here! Look, I'll give you these sparkly acorns! C'mon!
Let's go!
- Hey!
- Hey!
Why did I come here?
Oh, right.
To report to my father... that I've become a Hashira.
So what if you've become a Hashira?
Worthless.
It means nothing.
You're never going to amount to anything anyway.
Neither you... nor I.
Brother...
Was our father pleased to hear your news?
Do you think our father will acknowledge me if I become a Hashira, too?
He wasn't always like that.
After all, he did rise to the rank of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps.
He was a passionate man.
And yet, one day, out of the blue, he quit being a swordsman.
Suddenly.
The man who'd raised us both with such enthusiasm...
Why?
It's pointless to think about such things, so stop.
Senjuro is even worse off.
He barely has any memories of our mother who died of illness when he was very young, and just look at the state our father is in.
I'm going to be honest.
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.
He told me that it meant nothing.
But that's not enough to extinguish my passion!
This flame inside my heart will never go out!
I'll never give in!
And Senjuro...
You're not like me.
You have a big brother... who believes in his little brother.
No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being!
Keep that burning passion inside your heart!
Let's do our best!
Let's do our best and live on!
No matter how lonely it gets.
Looking good.
Those ropes that I created are used... for a special technique that allows one to invade the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.
I always fight with the utmost caution.
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not, you're no different than a baby.
I'll enjoy the feast after killing the Demon Slayers.
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.
Relax your shoulders.
Like this?
That's right.
Close call. He's right there.
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!
I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!
Hurry!
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.
That's what you must destroy.
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.
There it is!
The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further.
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!
And then, I'll get to see a happy dream myself!
What an odd realm of the subconscious.
It's hot.
It's burning up.
I have to hurry.
Found it!
The spiritual core!
I've never seen a red one before.
All I have to do is destroy this and...
It'll be my turn to...
I thought humans couldn't move while they were under a spell.
What a strong survival instinct he has!
I'm going to make your favorite rice crackers today, Tanjiro.
Wow!
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one who likes rice crackers!
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!
Then, let's eat them together, okay?
Can you get the grill ready for me?
Okay!
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!
Okay, I'll be in charge of flipping them over, then!
Me, too!
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!
No fair!
There.
Nezuko, let's go.
What did I just say?
I'm back!
Welcome home, Tanjiro.
Yeah, I'm home!
Welcome home, Big Bro!
Huh? Where's Nezuko?
Big Sis went up the mountain to pick vegetables.
In broad daylight?
She's not supposed to?
Well...
Um...
Tanjiro...
Could you get the bath ready?
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.
I keep saying all these strange things.
Am I tired maybe?
Huh? It's gone.
I wonder what that was for just a split second.
A toolbox perhaps?
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
You're under attack!
It's a dream!
This is a dream!
Wake up now!
I see... That's right, I'm... on board the train!
Wake up and fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!
No, you don't! You stop it right now!
Why are you always taking food away from Big Bro?
What's your problem?
You just had seconds!
No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!
How can I get out of it?
Now that I've realized that it's a dream...
What am I supposed to do?
I have to wake up...
Big Bro!
- What should we do? The fire is—
- Big Bro!
That's Nezuko's scent!
It's Nezuko's blood!
Nezuko...
Nezuko!
My uniform...
My Nichirin Sword...
I'm waking up!
Little by little.
Little by little!
Big Bro?
Big Bro, are you all right?
Big Bro?
Sorry.
I have to go.
I have to hurry back!
I'm sorry.
Big Bro!
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!
If the demon who's showing me this dream is nearby...
I have to find him and slash him right away!
Where is he? I have to...
Where are you going, Big Bro?
I picked lots of vegetables today!
Mom! This way!
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!
Mom?
Tanjiro, are you all right?
Big Bro...
What's the matter, Tanjiro?
Why are you dressed like that?
I wish I could stay here... forever.
I wish I could turn around and go back.
By rights, I should've been living like this forever.
Right here.
If none of this had happened... they'd all have been alive and well now.
And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight, under the blue sky.
If none of this had happened...
If none of this had happened...
I should be here making charcoal every day.
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!
If none of this had happened...
If none of this had happened...
But I've lost them now.
I can never go back!
Big Bro!
Don't leave us behind!
Sorry!
I'm sorry, Rokuta!
We can't be together anymore.
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?
I'll be thinking of you all!
There are lots of things to thank you for.
Lots of things to be sorry for!
But I will never forget you!
No matter what, my heart will always be with you!
So, please... forgive me!
I have to destroy his spiritual core right away.
So, this is the inside of his heart?
How can it be so beautiful?
It's so endlessly vast... and... also warm.
Where the heck is his spiritual core?
What's with this realm of the subconscious?
And that creepy naked boar...
Seriously, this is insane.
What are you doing in the realm of the subconscious?
You stupid naked boar!
It's pitch-dark.
It's pitch-dark, and I can't see a thing. Dammit.
What's with that blond brat's realm of subconscious?
Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core?
You must be kidding me.
What was that?
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko.
I'm so going to kill you.
Where's Nezuko?
Wh-Who the heck knows?
All right, then... Die!
Nooo!
They're having trouble, aren't they?
I wonder why.
They haven't destroyed any of the spiritual cores yet.
Oh well...
I guess it doesn't matter, since they're buying me some time.
Not here.
But I can smell a demon, even faintly.
What's this, though?
It's like there's a film over everything!
There's a faint demon scent everywhere!
I can't tell the exact location!
I have to hurry!
Nezuko's bleeding!
If everyone else is asleep, we're in big trouble!
What should I do?
Am I unable to use
Total Concentration Breathing now?
Am I just asleep right now?
Tanjiro...
Take up your sword.
There's something you must cut.
There's something...
I must cut.
There's something I must cut... in order to wake up.
I think I know what it is.
But what if I'm wrong?
If what happens in this dream has an effect on reality, too... there'll be no going back.
Don't hesitate! Do it!
You have to do it!
My death in this dream will lead me to reality!
In other words... what I have to cut is... my own neck!
I'm all right. I'm alive.
Nezuko! Are you okay?
Nezuko...
Zenitsu...
Inosuke...
Rengoku...
Who are these people?
They're all connected by the wrists with ropes.
Rope...
What's this?
It's burned off.
Nezuko's burning blood did it?
It's faint, but I'm picking up a demon's scent, too!
This smell... The ticket!
I knew it. It's giving off a faint demon smell, too.
We were put to sleep when our tickets were punched.
This must be a demon's work!
Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art using just this faint scent?
I don't know why... but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever this rope with my Nichirin Sword.
Nezuko! Do me a favor!
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!
Zenitsu! Wake up!
Wake up, Zenitsu!
You have to wake up!
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!
Inosuke...
There, there... Sorry, okay?
Thanks.
You did a great job, Nezuko.
It's no good. These two don't wake up.
What can I do?
Rengoku—
What are you doing?
Is a demon controlling her?
Get out of our way!
Thanks to you guys, we won't be able to have dreams!
Is she acting of her own free will?
This man, too?
What do you think you're doing?
If you're awake, you'd better help us out!
You may have tuberculosis or whatever, but if you don't do your job,
I'm going to tell him, and then, he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?
Is he the one who was connected to me?
Tuberculosis...
He's sick.
Poor man.
What this demon did is unforgivable.
He took advantage of their weak souls!
Sorry.
I have to go fight.
You want to stay inside a happy dream, don't you?
I know.
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.
If only this was the dream...
I was willing... to hurt others if it meant
I could escape from the pain of this illness.
But it was warm... inside your dream and inside your soul.
You must be the incarnations of this boy's soul.
The air is so clear, and it feels good.
Is that his spiritual core?
Why are you showing it to me?
Did you bring me here because I was searching for it?
No way!
Even though I was trying to destroy it?
Why would you...
The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart.
Are you all right?
Thank you.
Be careful.
Right!
Nezuko!
The smell is overpowering!
So heavy!
The demon's scent is so strong even in this strong wind!
Was I asleep in such an awful scent?
Even if each car was closed off and airtight,
I can't believe I was!
I was useless!
The demon's upwind...
Is he in the first car?
Nezuko, don't come!
Stay away from me and wait!
Go wake everyone up!
What? You're awake?
Good morning!
You could've stayed asleep.
It was him!
Why did you wake up?
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?
I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered.
Would you have liked that one better?
No, of course not.
Too distressing, right?
All right, next...
Why don't I show you a dream where your father comes back to life?
What I really love... is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream.
I just adore the sight of a distorted human face.
I get such a kick out of that!
How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?
But I don't usually let my guard down.
So, it may take longer, but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers.
I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets.
Once the conductor punches them, creating clamp marks... the spell activates.
And yet... how did this one manage to wake up?
And he found the way to wake up in a short time.
Even though the human desire for blissful dreams, for self-serving dreams... is so enormous!
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!
I won't let you... get away with this!
What's that? I see he's wearing earrings.
How lucky is that?
So, he came right to me!
This is like a dream!
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!
And once I become more powerful,
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon to a duel to replace him!
Water Breathing...
Tenth Form...
Constant Flux!
Blood Demon Art!
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.
Go to sleep!
He's not falling asleep.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep!
Go to sleep!
Go... to... sleep!
It's not working. But why not?
No, that's not what this is.
He's falling under this spell over and over!
He's aware that he's under the spell right away.
And he's committing suicide in order to awaken!
Even if it's in the middle of a dream, to commit suicide... to take his own life with his own hands... that takes incredible willpower!
This brat... is insane!
Why didn't you save us?
What were you doing while we were being murdered?
How could you be the only one to survive?
Why do you think you were here?
You're so useless!
It should've been you that died.
How dare you go on living without a care.
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!
Don't you dare... insult... my family!
It was way too easy.
Could this be a dream, too?
Or was this demon weaker than him?
I can totally see why... he ordered me to kill you, the boy with the earrings, along with the Hashira!
Your very existence is, like...
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!
He's not dying?
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!
That's the look I've been wanting to see!
You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you?
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.
It's so easy even an infant would understand.
It's because the body over there was no longer my main body.
Same with this thing that's talking to you now.
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.
While you were snoozing away...
I fused with this train!
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!
Look at your face.
Are you getting it now?
In other words... the more than 200 passengers on this train... are the food that will strengthen my body even more... as well as my hostages.
So, do you think you can protect them by yourself?
All these people packing this train from one end to another...
Can you alone keep me from devouring them?
What should I do? What should I do?
The most I can protect on my own is two cars!
Any more than that, and I can't guarantee their safety!
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!
This is no time to be sleeping!
Wake up, will you? Please!
Nezuko!
Protect the sleeping passengers!
Follow me, damn minions!
All right!
Explosive Awakening!
Comin' through!
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!
Inosuke!
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!
This whole train's turned into a demon!
Can you hear me?
This whole train is a demon!
I knew it!
So, I was right on the money!
That means I was a total stud as a leader!
Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...
Crazy Cutting!
I'll save every last one of you guys!
Fall onto your knees... and worship me!
Glorify me!
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!
I have to go save the passengers!
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!
It's gone this far already?
Water Breathing...
First Form...
Water Surface Slash!
No good.
This is never going to end!
How am I supposed to fend it off?
Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me.
You can cut all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating.
And then, after all your strength is depleted...
I'm going to partake of those
200 passengers in a leisurely feast.
Thunder Breathing...
First Form...
Thunderclap and Flash!
Sixfold.
I'll protect you...
Nezuko!
Protect...
That sounded like thunder.
From one of the cars in the back?
What's going on?
Is Zenitsu awake now?
What about Rengoku?
And Nezuko?
I cannot do anything but protect the people here!
This is bad! What should I do?
We can't fight in coordination!
Are the passengers in the back all right?
Damn!
It's so cramped!
And so hard to swing my sword!
To think that all of this happened while I was dozing...
How could this be?
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.
If only I could crawl... under a rock!
What happened?
What was that?
A demon attack?
Young Kamado!
Rengoku!
I was pretty thorough with my slashing attacks on my way here, so it should take the demon a while to regenerate.
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!
Okay!
This train has eight cars in all.
I'll protect the five in the rear.
The yellow boy and your sister will be in charge of the rest.
You and the boar head boy... will go look for the demon's head while keeping an eye on those three cars.
Head?
But this demon is—
No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!
Amazing! I can't even see him!
Did the train shake earlier because Rengoku was on the move?
He's so quick to read the situation and make decisions!
Five cars, all by himself?
This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!
The demon's scent is getting stronger by the second! Hurry!
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?
Shut up, or I'll kill you!
Up there, huh?
That guy with the goggle eyes ordered me around!
But somehow...
Somehow...
Somehow, he was awesome!
I'm so pissed!
Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front!
You don't have to tell me!
And by the way, I've found it! Already!
With my all-out Seventh Form...
I found this master's weak spot!
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?
That's right, up front!
And that front part is a heck of a lot creepier!
The scent got swept away because the wind is so strong, making it hard to detect, but if Inosuke says so, there's no doubt about it!
So, it's around where the coal's loaded, right?
That's right!
Understood!
Okay, let's go!
Forward!
This is it, huh?
All right!
Inosuke!
Fishy, very fishy!
Especially around here!
Who the hell are you?
G-Get out of here!
The demon's head...
The demon's... weak spot!
Gross!
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!
That's way too many hands!
Uh-oh!
Water Breathing, Sixth Form...
Whirlpool!
Inosuke, are you all right?
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?
Yeah, I know!
It's here...
It's right beneath!
Directly below this place.
The demon's scent is powerful!
Inosuke! The demon's head is right below here!
Don't boss me around!
I'm the leader!
Fine!
Just watch.
Beast Breathing, Second Fang...
Slice!
It's the bone.
His neck bone!
Water Breathing, Eighth Form...
Waterfall Basin!
It blocked it!
The gash is closing up!
It's regenerating so fast!
Not only that, but it took everything I had just to expose the bone!
I have to sever it!
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize our breathing and attack together!
One of us will slash the flesh while the other jumps in to sever the bone!
Sounds good! Great idea!
I can praise you for that!
Thanks!
Let's go!
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.
A Blood Demon Art!
He got me!
He's putting me to sleep!
Inosuke! Slash your own neck in your dreams!
Then, you'll wake up!
It's all right!
Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!
Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!
Okay, I'm awake!
Damn! Even though I'm awake,
I can't avoid looking at the eyes!
I have to wake up with my eyes shut!
With my eyes shut!
No good!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Hurry!
Cut the neck!
Cut it! Cut it!
I have to wake up!
Hurry!
Wake up!
This isn't a dream! It's reality!
Don't fall for his trap!
Don't die such lame deaths!
I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head.
I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye!
You loser eyeballs!
I see. He's having a hard time telling which way Inosuke's looking!
All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death!
Inosuke!
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!
Did you get stabbed?
I'm okay.
Just forget about that bastard!
I can't do that! I won't let him die!
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon, we won't be able to make it!
I know! Let's get moving!
Inosuke!
Synchronize your breathing with mine!
And let's chop off the demon's head!
Let's attack together!
No good! If I fall asleep now...
Damn you!
C'mon! Follow me!
Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...
Slice 'n' Dice!
Father, please protect me!
I'm going to sever that bone... with this blow!
Hinokami Kagura...
Clear Blue Sky!
Because of its screams and tremors, the train's turning over!
Are you okay, Inosuke?
H-Hey, is your belly okay?
Y-Yeah!
Inosuke, protect the passen—
I can't die.
If I die, that'll make him a murderer!
I can't die!
I don't want to let anyone die!
Are you okay, Santaro?
Hang in there!
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!
Cool, huh?
Is your belly okay?
Your belly that got stabbed!
I'm... all right.
What about you?
Never felt better!
I didn't even catch a cold!
I won't be able to move for a while.
Help the others, will you?
Was anyone injured?
What about the engineer near the head?
It's okay if that bastard dies!
It's not okay.
He's the one who stabbed you in the belly, remember?
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!
His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore!
Just leave him there, and he'll die!
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.
Help him, will you?
Please.
I'll go for you, then!
Because I'm the boss!
Because my minion asked me to!
After I rescue him,
I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!
That's really not necessary.
It's almost dawn.
Get your breathing under control.
We have to... save the injured... before it's too late.
Nezuko...
Zenitsu...
Rengoku...
I'm sure they're all safe!
You have to believe!
My body's disintegrating.
I can't regenerate.
Did I lose? Am I going to die?
Me?
Ridiculous.
Ridiculous!
I haven't been able to go all out!
I couldn't devour a single human!
My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke!
And now, look what I've been reduced to!
After all the time and trouble I've taken!
It was him!
It's all his fault!
Even though I'd taken
200 humans hostage, still I struggled!
I was held at bay!
Is this the power of a Hashira?
And him... He was fast, too.
Even though he never broke the spell completely!
Not to mention that girl!
She's a demon! What's that about?
A demon, joining forces with Demon Slayers?
Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?
Dammit! Dammit!
In the first place... it all started going downhill once that brat broke my spell!
That brat is to blame!
I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!
That's right, and that boar, too!
I could've at least killed that brat!
But that boar thwarted me.
His intuition is extraordinary.
He could sense my gaze!
Am I going to lose?
Am I going to die?
Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!
It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers.
In the Upper Ranks... the same demons have remained for the last few centuries.
They're strong enough to defeat Hashira who've killed an untold number of demons.
Do they have otherworldly powers?
Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!
I want to do it over!
I want to do it over!
What a miserable nightmare this is...
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.
Impressive!
Rengoku...
After all, Constant is the first step toward becoming a Hashira.
Although, there might be 10,000 steps before you can become a Hashira.
I'll do my best.
You're bleeding from the abdomen.
You have to concentrate harder and improve the precision of your breathing.
Make your nerves reach every corner of your body.
There's a blood vessel.
A torn blood vessel.
Concentrate harder!
That's it. Stanch it.
Stop the bleeding.
Focus!
Great! Looks like you stopped it.
You'll be able to do all kinds of things when you master breathing.
Not that you'll be able to do everything, but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure.
Right.
Everyone's safe!
There are hordes of injured people, but no one's life is in danger.
Don't strain yourself.
Take it easy and rest up.
Thank you very much.
Upper... Three?
What's he doing here and now?
Flame Breathing, Second Form...
Rising Scorching Sun!
That's a fine sword.
He sure can regenerate fast.
This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...
So, this is an Upper Rank.
I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first.
He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me.
What would you and I have to talk about?
I'm meeting you now for the first time, but I already dislike you.
Is that right?
Well, I loathe weak humans, too.
The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl.
Then, it looks like our senses of value are completely different.
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.
Why don't you become a demon, too?
I will not.
I can tell your strength at a glance.
You're a Hashira, aren't you?
Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt.
It's close to the realm of the highest.
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.
I'm Akaza.
Kyojuro...
Let me tell you why you can't enter the realm of the highest.
Because you're a human.
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.
Become a demon, Kyojuro.
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.
You can become stronger.
Of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!
I have to help him fight!
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty of being an ephemeral creature like a human.
The fact that we grow old and die is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.
This boy isn't weak!
Don't insult him.
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.
You and I have different senses of value.
No matter what the reason,
I will not become a demon!
I see.
Technique Development...
Destructive Death... Compass Needle!
If you refuse to become a demon,
I'll kill you.
I can't follow their movements!
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.
And no one ever took me up on my offer, either.
Why do you think that is?
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.
Not when only the chosen ones can become demons!
Watching the hideous decline of someone blessed with extraordinary powers...
It pains me! I can't bear it!
Die, Kyojuro... while you're still young and strong.
Destructive Death...
Air Type!
I see.
Flame Breathing...
Fourth Form...
Blooming Flame Undulation!
When he strikes the air with his fist, the attack will reach me here!
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.
If I allow him to fight from a distance like this, slicing his head off will be tricky.
In that case...
I'll just have to get up close!
This superb reaction speed of yours... and these breathtaking sword skills will be lost, too...
Kyojuro!
Doesn't that make you sad?
It happens to everyone!
It's a fact of life for any human!
Stay where you are!
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!
Stand back! That's an order!
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!
Come on, give me your best shot!
Concentrate on me.
Nice moves!
Rengoku!
Ol' Goggle-eyes!
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.
Fight me forever and get stronger together with me.
You have what it takes to do that!
I'll pass!
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!
I will not become a demon!
Flame Breathing...
Third Form...
Blazing Universe!
Magnificent! That's sensational!
Destructive Death...
Air Type!
There's no opening.
I can't jump in.
I can't keep up with the speed of their movements!
Those two are in a different dimension!
Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!
I can't move... because I know that even if I jumped in to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!
Rengoku...
You still don't get it?
That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?
Flame Breathing, First Form...
Unknowing Fire!
It would be a shame to kill you now!
You haven't reached your physical peak yet!
Second Form...
Rising Scorching Sun!
In a year or two, you'll have polished your skills even more, and you'll have greater precision!
Third Form...
Blazing Universe!
Fourth Form...
Blooming Flame Undulation!
Destructive Death...
Fifth Form...
Flame Tiger!
Disorder!
Kyojuro!
Did he do it? Did he win?
Don't tell me...
No way!
Let's fight more.
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.
Rengoku...
Rengoku!
Rengoku!
Even if you fight to death, you can't win, Kyojuro.
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me have already healed completely.
But what about you?
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...
All irreparable.
If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye.
Those would be mere scratches for a demon.
You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon.
I want to go help him!
But there's no strength in my arms or legs.
It's partly because of my injury, but this always happens after I use the Hinokami Kagura technique!
Kyojuro, why...
I...
I will fulfill my duty!
I will not allow anyone here to die!
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!
Flame Breathing...
Esoteric Art!
What a tremendous fighting spirit!
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!
That mental strength!
That airtight stance!
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!
Let's fight each other for all eternity!
Set your heart ablaze.
Go beyond your limits!
I'm the Flame Hashira...
Kyojuro Rengoku!
Ninth Form...
Rengoku!
Destructive Death...
Annihilation Type!
Rengoku!
Rengoku!
Rengoku!
I see hi—
Ren... goku...
You'll die! This will kill you, Kyojuro!
Become a demon!
Say that you'll become a demon!
You are... strong and one of the chosen ones!
Kyojuro...
Yes, Mother?
I want you to think hard... about what I'm about to ask you.
Do you know why you were born stronger than others?
I don't know!
So that you can save weaker people.
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.
You must never use that God-given strength to hurt others or for personal gain.
It is the duty of those born strong to help the weak.
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.
Make sure you never forget that.
I won't!
I don't have much more time to live.
I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child.
I will entrust everything to you.
Mother...
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!
He stopped it?
What unbelievable strength!
I've pierced through his solar plexus with my right arm!
Damn!
It'll be daybreak soon!
I have to kill him and get out of here!
I can't... pull my arm out!
I won't let you escape!
No matter what Rengoku says...
I have to... do it right now!
I have to slice off the demon's head!
Quickly!
The sun's coming up!
There'll be sunlight here!
I have to get away!
I have to get away!
No way am I ever letting go!
Not until I chop off your head!
Out of my way!
Move, Inosuke!
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!
Beast Breathing, Fang One...
Pierce!
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!
That took too long!
I have to get away from the sun!
Don't run away!
Don't run away, you coward!
Don't run away!
What the hell is that brat talking about?
Doesn't he have a brain in his head?
I'm not running away from you!
I'm running away from the sun!
And besides, the battle's already been decided!
He'll run out of strength and die soon!
The Demon Slayer Corps... is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage!
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!
Our wounds don't close up that easily!
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!
Don't run away, you bastard!
You bastard!
You coward!
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!
He's stronger!
Rengoku didn't lose!
He didn't let anybody die!
He fought to the end!
He protected them to the end!
You're the one who lost!
It's Rengoku who won!
Stop yelling already.
You'll reopen that stomach wound.
You're badly injured, too, remember?
If you die, young Kamado, it'll mean I'm the loser.
Rengoku...
Come over here.
Let's talk a bit one last time.
There's something that I remembered... while I was dreaming.
You should go to my parents' home, the Rengoku residence.
There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira.
My father read them often, but since I never did,
I don't know what's in them.
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.
Please stop the bleeding with a breathing technique!
Isn't there a way to close up your wounds?
No.
I'll be dead soon.
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?
Tell my little brother Senjuro... to follow his heart... and to walk down the path that he feels is right.
Tell my father... that I want him to take care of himself.
One more thing.
Young Kamado...
I believe in your little sister.
I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.
I saw her bleeding as she protected the humans inside the train.
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans... is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps no matter what anyone else says.
Go ahead and live with your head held high!
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness... set your heart ablaze.
Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.
Even if you stop and crouch down, the time won't wait for you... or snuggle you and grieve along with you.
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here.
As a Hashira, of course I would shield my juniors.
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.
We never let the young buds get nipped.
Young Kamado...
Young Boar Head...
Yellow Boy...
Keep learning and grow.
And then, become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.
I believe in you.
I believe in you all.
Mother...
Do you think I did it right?
Did I carry out what I had to do... and my duties?
You made me proud.
When the train went off the rails,
Rengoku had unleashed all these techniques.
He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum.
I guess he did.
I can't believe he's gone.
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon really show up?
Yeah.
Why would an Upper Rank come here?
Was it that strong? I mean...
Yeah.
I'm so frustrated!
As soon as I master one thing,
I find another thick wall right in front of me... while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it.
I just can't make it there yet!
If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I...
Can I... ever become like Rengoku?
Stop whining already!
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!
Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back!
Don't cry even if you have regrets!
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel, you still have to go on living!
But you're crying, too.
There are tears flooding out from that headpiece.
I'm not crying!
Get over here!
We're gonna train!
Is that so...
Rengoku...
So, even Rengoku couldn't beat an Upper Rank demon?
I don't believe it.
Namu Amida Butsu.
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!
I see.
So, not one of the 200 passengers lost their lives?
Kyojuro did a great job, then.
What a remarkable child.
I'm not sad.
I don't have much longer to live, either.
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others... in the land of the dead.
Rengoku...
Rengoku...
Rengoku!
