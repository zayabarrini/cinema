Does anyone know the difference between "was" and "used to be"?
Anyone?
"Was" means it has passed.
In fact, both of them mean that it has passed.
But the difference is that "used to be" carries a sense of loss.
Does everybody understand?
Let's go over the tenses again.
One, one, two, one!
Score above 600!
- Score above 600!
- Score above 600!
- Get into the university of your dreams!
- Get into the university of your dreams!
- Never quit!
- Never quit!
- Never give up!
- Never give up!

ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE AWARD
ADVANCED CLASS
COUNTDOWN TO NATIONAL COLLEGE
ENTRANCE EXAM: 60 DAYS
GRADE TWELVE, SCIENCE, CLASS TEN
- Did she jump off the building?
- Is it her?
REALLY? WHY?
Really?
Stop taking photos!
Put your phones away!
Everyone, back to your classrooms!
OKAY
TOO MUCH PRESSURE?
WHAT HAPPENED?
SELF-DISCIPLINE,
WORK HARD, NO REGRETS
WHY?
WHY ELSE?
SNOOZE FOR 5 MINUTES
GRADE 12
Is Chen Nian here?
Chen Nian.
The teacher asked for you.
Relax.
We just need to ask you a few questions.
Did Hu Xiaodie say anything to you the day she died?
Nothing.
Are you sure?
Take your time.
Think about it.
I heard you're taking the college entrance exam this year.
You enrolled in a remedial course to get into a prestigious university, right?
Her old school wasn't academically up to par.
Did Hu Xiaodie have any close friends in school?
Friends aren't necessary here.
Do you mean you or her?
Just me.
I don't know about other people.
Suicide is a serious matter.
Did she appear emotionally disturbed to you?
Or did something happen to her?
Chen Nian.
If you know something, tell us.
The school board is highly concerned about campus safety now.
The school and teachers will protect you.
Don't be afraid.
Why did you do it?
You said you barely knew her.
It's time for class.
They can't spare more time.
The exams are approaching.
We need your cooperation in this investigation.
Hu Xiaodie... probably wouldn't want to be seen like that.
Didn't you hear the bell?
Rise.
Salute.
- Good day, sir.
- Good day, sir.
Sit.
What's wrong?
Who did this?
The exam is almost here!
There is no time for pranks!
Also, try to get along with your classmates.
If you are being bullied, you must tell me.
Okay?
- Hello, sir.
- Hold on.
- Okay.
- I'll deal with your child later.
I am your teacher.
I care about your grades as well as your life.
Is your mom home yet?
No.
Okay, go back to class.
PEKING UNIVERSITY,
TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY
The child will have her exam soon.
Someone must be home.
- Zhou Lei!
- I know you're in there!
Stop hiding! Open the door!
I know you're inside! Open up!
Zhou Lei!
Open the door!
- Zhou Lei!
- Pay us back!
Want stewed pork dumplings?
What? Stewed pork dumplings?
Stop pushing me.
Chen Nian is over there.
Let's go over to her.
Hi. We're coming in.
Your ranking went up again this week.
What?
How did you manage to do so well?
Want to join our study group?
Why not?
I want to ask you a few English questions.
I don't have time.
No time? Really?
She just doesn't want to waste time on you.
Nonsense.
Chen Nian is not so petty.
She's a nice person and she's good to her classmates.
Isn't that right, Chen Nian?
Let me take your picture.
Chen Nian!
Hey, are you okay?
Don't worry.
We just want to show our appreciation.
When you covered up Xiaodie's body the other day,
I was so touched.
But when you talked to the police,
I wasn't so touched anymore.
So what did you tell them?
Mom, I've told you before.
Don't open the curtains.
The creditors will show up.
Where were you? You're back so late.
Hey.
Where did you find this?
- I've been searching for it all day.
- Isn't the mask contraband?
It won't perform miracles, but it won't kill you.
What actually happened?
- Let's listen to the interviews.
- Mom!
When the emergency...
DELIVERY ORDER
Are there a lot?
Not really.
So this is how hair turns grey overnight.
Yet, you keep selling illegal goods.
I'm a victim too.
The area I picked isn't bad.
When I get my cut, you'll get your college tuition.
How are your studies?
Good.
My test scores this month are among the top ten.
I know I'm not a good mom.
Be patient.
Once you graduate from college, we'll escape this hellhole.
I know I owe you.
Boys, help the girls.
I don't know why you're laughing.
I do hope you'll be happy after the college entrance exam.
Let me tell you.
Being placed in the last row doesn't determine your future social position, but you will have a hard life.
If you want an easier life, you better start working hard now.
Some of you have scored consistently well, so they deserve praise.
Wei Lai, keep it up.
Thank you, sir.
Luo Jun.
I worry I'll be seeing you again next year.
- Now!
- Mess him up!
- Come on!
- How dare you beat up my brother?
You're telling me to go to hell?
You can go first!
Bottle!
Bastard!
Get up!
Weren't you so tough?
Someone's getting beaten up by a gang...
Come here!
Hey, she called the police.
Is he your boyfriend?
Speak the hell up!
- Speak up!
- No.
Then why did you call the police?
Crazy bitch!
Give me your bag!
Fifty yuan?
Give me your phone.
- I said, give me your phone!
- Hey!
She's just a girl.
I get it now.
Get him.
This bitch likes him.
She has a crush on him and wants to help.
Make her kiss this mad dog!
Kiss him!
Kiss him!
- Do it!
- Hurry up!
- Are you deaf?
- I'm letting you kiss him.
- Didn't you hear me?
- Do you have a death wish?
Hurry and kiss him!
Kiss him!
Do you want him to die?
Still won't kiss him?
Do it!
She really did it!
She kissed him!
How dare you mess with my brother?
- They kissed!
- Who are you?
Brother!
Brother, are you all right?
This is not over!
How much did they take?
- Answer me.
- Fifty yuan.
I don't have any change.
Beishan!
Give me your phone.
I thought we're here for change.
You have to buy something first.
MOBILE PHONE REPAIR
This will cost 200 yuan.
- What?
- I'm not scamming you.
It needs major repairs.
The parts alone cost 150 yuan.
Okay.
Give me 50 yuan back.
Fine.
You're so cheap.
If you don't want to pay the service fee, you can fix it yourself.
- You can fix phones?
- I deal in stolen phone parts.
You had it repaired before?
Most of the original parts were replaced.
You didn't watch the repair?
They probably stole your data too.
I don't have any important data.
Fool.
You're a perfect target.
Look.
If you pay me,
I can protect you.
You can't even protect yourself.
How can you protect me?
Getting beat up is nothing.
I always get even in the end.
Carry on fighting.
I'm going to the best university in the country, unlike you.
How are we different?
Don't you see?
Either you bully others or you get bullied.
So which kind are you?
Is your house to the left or right?
You don't have to escort me.
What's your name?
You can't tell me even after we've kissed?
Hey!
POLICE
Pull down your hood.
- How did you get hurt?
- Is it a crime?
Just answer the question.
Show me your ID.
LIAR EXPOSED!
DON'T TRUST THIS CROOK
Wow, look at this!
"Your daughter is still in school."
"It won't look good if we take it to court."
LIAR EXPOSED!
DON'T TRUST THIS CROOK
Chen Nian!
Liu Yiping from Class 5 wants to buy a facial mask!
Shut up! Enough already!
THE SMART ALWAYS FIND WAYS
THE FOOLISH TRAP THEMSELVES
- Where to?
- Wherever.
Sit.
Shut the door.
I HAVE MONEY TO HELP YOU
AND YOUR MOM
Are you fighting with your boyfriend?
Why come here if you have one?
POWER OFF
- Do you like me?
- What is there to like?
I never even considered it.
Then why follow me home?
I didn't expect you to bring me here.
Is my place too shabby for you?
Don't worry.
I don't intend to sleep with you.
Then why bring it up?
I did consider it though.
Are you sure you want to continue?
I'm just making small talk.
Did anybody ever teach you manners?
Are you scared now?
I'm just a punk.
Why should I bother with manners?
Class is over.
You can go and study if you wish.
Put the balls back when you leave.
My mom said,
"Like mom, like daughter.
Like a chip off the old block."
You must be exhausted from paying off your mom's debt.
How can you even play today?
Are you done?
Chen Nian.
- Chen Nian.
- Chen Nian.
Are you all right?
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Be careful when using the stairs next time.
Keep your wound dry.
You're good to go.
Just one more month and we can go to Beijing.
What if I can't hold out?
Like Hu Xiaodie?
She was weak.
She let those people affect her.
She wasn't the only weak one.
Both of us are weak too.
They've been bullying me all along.
Why didn't any of you do anything?
Hello, Officer Zheng?
That's absurd.
I don't even remember it.
I'm afraid of ghosts.
Hu Xiaodie was a slut.
Everyone hated her.
Why single us out?
What about Chen Nian?
Didn't you push her down the stairs?
Tell me how you bullied her.
You believe her?
I know nothing.
We're good friends with Chen Nian.
We play pranks on each other all the time.
- Just now...
- Pranks?
So what prank did you play that pushed Hu Xiaodie to suicide?
Do you have any proof?
Would you be here if I didn't?
It was her choice to kill herself.
I had nothing to do with it.
She didn't want to repeat the course.
Her mom forced her to take lessons.
Her grades were terrible.
The teacher said third-tier colleges were her best hope.
Maybe she was under too much pressure.
Don't you feel even a tiny bit of remorse?
Who's calling me?
Your mom.
Your parents should see you now.
Answer it.
If you've already told them, why ask me all this bullshit?
I didn't do anything.
Even if my mom comes,
I won't give them a penny.
Maybe it's good that Hu Xiaodie died.
How else would her mom get such a big payout?
If she sues, she might even get a half million!
Even if she didn't die and went to college. it would've taken her years to earn that much.
There's something I want to tell you.
School bullying cases are rather tricky.
You can't file charges without concrete evidence.
In the end, the Ministry of Education always intervenes.
More witnesses will come forward.
Why did you bully others when you were young?
I didn't.
Then you were bullied.
I don't smoke.
Empathy only comes with age.
You just tend to forget your wrongdoings.
We weren't nearly as bad as they are now.
It's quite common now.
Not long ago, a group of senior high students beat a classmate to death.
When I took their statements, none of them thought that a person could be beaten to death.
Just because these cases happen on campus, doesn't mean it doesn't spread off-campus.
If you try talking to the principal, he'll pass it on to the teachers who will then pass it on to the parents.
Then the parent will say,
"I work in Shenzhen.
I only see my kid once a year."
Who else is left?
No matter what, we are the police.
We must try our best to help.
Please give her another chance.
I'm begging you.
- I'll kneel!
- Mom!
Xiaomiao, come and kneel!
- Don't kneel!
- Beg your teacher! Beg him!
- Plead to the teacher.
- Please get up.
- Please reinvestigate!
- What are you doing?
- Please reinvestigate!
- Get off me!
Don't get physical!
This is a school! Behave yourself!
- Get back inside.
- Please get up.
- Please help us.
- Get up.
It's all your fault!
- Who are you? Stop!
- Don't stop me!
Call security!
Why can't you study?
Don't! Stop!
You have no right to do that!
Is this how you parent your child?
This is ridiculous!
They've all been suspended.
But they'll still attend the college entrance exam.
They're still young.
We want to give them a second chance.
Try to get past this.
Don't let this distract you.
Chen Nian.
You did the right thing.
Trust that you did the right thing.
There will always be shadows on the path, but when you look up, you will always see the light.
I'm responsible for all of this too.
You'll get a new homeroom teacher.
Chen Nian!
Are you disappointed in me?
I'm disappointed too.
But who can I blame?
- We did the best we could...
- But you know the truth, right?
Up until I was 18 years old,
I didn't like to sleep.
My high school teacher told me to try for the police academy or a medical school.
Both professions require working at night.
I did what she said and became a cop.
I gradually came to appreciate sleep.
Do you know why?
There are people and things
I would rather not see.
We're not that kind of family.
Her dad and I always teach her principles and moral values.
What kind of people to befriend and how to befriend others.
They're essential social skills.
There are things other kids don't even consider that she needs to consider because she's special.
Things aren't always what they seem.
For instance, what's the background of the parents?
Why was the child emotionally disturbed?
Shouldn't the school take responsibility?
Moreover, everything requires proof.
Should we get to the bottom of it, things will turn ugly.
Have you ever seen the eyes of wild animals just before they're killed?
My child is still young and naive.
It's hard to say who the innocent one is here.
They have no expression.
None at all.
It's because they're afraid.
You can see it in their eyes.
You don't need to be afraid anymore.
Concentrate on the college entrance exam.
Right.
Once the exam is over, we become adults.
My mom said that the advantage of getting older is that you begin to forget things.
Don't let anything affect you.
You forget it all in the end.
However, what they don't teach you is how to be an adult.
Chen Nian, listen to me.
Growing up is like diving.
Don't think.
Just close your eyes and jump in.
There will be sand, rocks, and clams in the river.
That's how we all grow up.
Nian, are you home?
Have you eaten?
Yes.
I ran into some trouble.
Some people had allergic reactions to the masks.
They make a scene here every day.
Hello?
Then come home. Just quit.
I can't make money back home.
Not to mention the creditors.
You're safer at home without me.
You're a child.
They won't do anything to you.
Hello?
Do you have enough money?
Yes, I do.
Doesn't the mask give you a rash?
I can't let it go to waste.
Don't blame me if anything happens.
I won't.
You want one? Buy it yourself.
Once I make it to Beijing, everything will be fine.
Let's open a small shop in front of the university.
I'll bring students to our store.
Let's make money off my classmates.
All right. That's my girl.
I know I can count on you.
Listen, you're amazing.
So am I.
We're reincarnations of the Monkey King.
We're both undefeatable.
It's nearly dawn.
Don't screw up now.
Okay?
I heard you.
Trust me.
- Keep it up.
- Sure.
I'm hanging up.
Sleep early.
I'm hanging up for real.
We should all stand up against bullying.
If anyone should seek help, the school will take the matter seriously!
COUNTDOWN TO NATIONAL COLLEGE
ENTRANCE EXAM: 43 DAYS
The entrance exam is very stressful, but the students' well-being is our priority.
The school will strengthen its counseling service.
Please approach the counselor if you have any questions.
We must persist!
It's you against the world!
Only if you can stand your ground, will you prevail!
We are not afraid, right?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Class dismissed.
What kind of replacement is he?
He's horrible.
Students, you'll be graduating soon!
You're entering the first stage of your life.
Are you happy?
- Yes!
- Yes!
Let's take a picture!
You're graduating!
Smile!
- Smile!
- Look here!
Three, two, one, say cheese!
- Cheese!
- Cheese!
You dared to call the cops.
Why don't you follow in
Hu Xiaodie's footsteps?
Die!
Chen Nian, why are you in such a hurry to die?
Why are you running?
Where are you going?
Stop running!
You think you can escape?
Stop!
Stop running!
Stop running!
That way!
Did you see her?
Go to her house!
She'll go home eventually.
OFFICER ZHENG
I couldn't take your call during interrogation.
What's the matter?
Zheng Yi, he's talking. Come back in.
Chen Nian?
I'm sorry, I misdialed.
Can you protect me?
I don't have money to pay you.
But I must go to Beijing.
Don't move.
Do you feel hot?
What did you say?
Do you feel hot?
No.
Is it hard?
What?
Is the couch hard?
No.
Didn't you look down on me?
Give me your notebook.
What?
Give me your notebook.
Bring a pen too.
Write here.
Chen Nian owes Beishan one.
I haven't specified what it is.
Maybe it's just a meal.
CHEN NIAN OWES
BEISHAN ONE FOR...
Maybe not a meal.
It could be something else.
You have to get up early.
Hey.
Don't touch Chen Nian.
Watch him.
Where's the money?
What are you looking at?
You have some guts coming here!
Pay up for the last job.
Grade 12 students, raise your right hand and take the oath!
I vow...
- "I vow..."
- "I vow..."
- I will not fail my parents!
- I will not fail my parents!
I will not disappoint my teachers!
- "I will not..."
- "I will not..."
You still owe me money!
Get lost!
I will smile confidently...
- ...as I strive for success and glory!
- ...as I strive for success and glory!
COUNTDOWN TO NCEE: 32 DAYS
WORK HARD, NO REGRETS
A plus B...
Six bamboo.
Three characters.
Five characters.
Five characters again.
Couldn't do it?
Then you can't eat tonight!
What are you memorizing?
A composition.
What for?
Our teacher can predict exam topics.
Predict?
Don't tell me.
I don't want to know.
Why don't you go to school?
- It's useless.
- It's not.
It's useful for you, but useless for me.
Bunch of punks.
You dare to cause a scene in my joint?
I'll do your parents a favor and set things right.
Don't you like to fight?
What are you waiting for?
Fight!
You're too pure.
You don't get it.
Who's protecting you?
Can he protect me too?
Why is it my turn?
I did everything they said.
I'll walk you home.
Does it hurt?
I'm used to it.
Since when?
Since I was 13.
My dad left us.
My mom was burdened with me.
She couldn't handle it.
She later met a man.
I woke up one morning... to find that she came home with some meat buns.
I was so happy.
Meat buns were a rare treat.
But as soon as I started eating, she slapped me.
While crying hard.
That man dumped her because of me.
Did she eventually get married?
I went back to look for her.
But she had moved.
Chen Nian?
You're the first person to ask me if it hurts.
Hello.
Thank you.
Are you being stalked lately?
I'm heading out for a bit.
It's not the first time
I've seen someone following you.
Can university graduates earn five grand a month?
More than that.
At least more than thirty grand.
Can we make that much?
Look at us.
We don't steal or deal drugs.
How can we ever make that much?
But you're good-looking.
You could sell your body.
Maybe I'm not who you think I am.
What did you say?
I ignored Hu Xiaodie because she wanted to be my friend.
I actually liked her.
Don't you realize that I don't deserve your kindness?
What did you just say?
It's coming!
Focus.
What are you doing?
Do you want to get away from here together?
How?
There must be a way.
One day, we'll walk proudly in broad daylight for the world to see.
Come!
- Swerve!
- Come!
- Medic!
- Shoot!
Everyone, stay calm!
- Don't run.
- Don't move!
- Don't move.
- What's happening?
- Raise your head!
- I am talking to you!
- Come!
- Stand up!
- You!
- What's up?
- You! And you!
- Stand up!
- You three, come with me.

- One by one, move forward!
- Where to?
- Stand up.
- Walk.
- We got a tip-off.
- Move it.
Someone reported seeing a suspected rapist here.
- Move.
- Please cooperate.
How long will this take?
Who knows?
They're looking for a rapist.
A girl is here to identify him.
Then why did you run?
I thought you were the cafe manager.
- What time is it?
- I clearly don't look like a rapist.
I'm asking you!
- It's more likely that I was raped.
- Nobody would want to rape you.
When will you release us?
It's not your first time.
It'll be done when it's done.
The number you called is temporarily unavailable.
Shut up if you want to live.
Shut up if you want to live!
Be serious!

Are you glaring at me?

What's more important?
Books or yourself?
You want to go to university?
In your dreams.
- A close-up shot.
- Miao, come here.
- Hit her.
- Go on.
- Good one!
- That's more like it!
Good lord.
Come on, go ahead!
Hit her!
A close-up shot!
Cut her hair!
Cut!
- Cut!
- More, keep going!
- More!
- Cut it all off.
So now you're not talking?
- Goodness.
- Why are you crying?
- What's wrong?
- Why are you crying?
Quit crying!
Do guys even like you?
Let's see.
You're not even pretty.
How did you get guys to help you?
What a pretentious slut.
You must have a great body.
Anybody want to see it?
- Yes!
- Yes!
Let's see what you have! Strip her!
- Strip her! Take it all off!
- Strip her!
What are you guys doing?
- I've called the cops!
- What a bitch!
We just say the same thing to the police every time.
That guy must be going to prison.
It's just a bottle.
Let go!
Let go!
Let go!
- Let go!
- Go and kill them all, then!
Students.

My car... was stolen.
Stolen?

Whatever they ask you, just tell the truth.
Is she really dead?
Why are you smiling?
I'm not.
Wei Lai hasn't called me since that day.
Which day?
It wasn't my fault.
They were out of control that day.
If I didn't do as they said, they would have killed me.
Chen Nian killed her.
You're accusing Chen Nian because you've been bullying her.
Who's the bully here?
Wei Lai feared for her life.
Quit crying!
So now you're not talking?
- Give her a haircut.
- Don't like the haircut?
What do you think of the haircut?
You have no right to cry.
- Quit crying!
- Why are you crying?
I saw the video.
Why didn't you call the police?
I had to focus on the entrance exam.
I filed a complaint once before.
Can we postpone this until after the exam?
I still have two papers tomorrow.
No.
You must come with me.
Chen Nian.
Wei Lai is dead.
You're a prime suspect.
Chen Nian, you're being interviewed as a suspect.
Tell the truth and we will be lenient.
Understand?
Answer me.
I understand.
Did you tell your mom about the incident?
Has she returned?
No.
Did it affect your studies?
They filmed you.
Why didn't you report them?
As I've said,
I wanted to focus on the exam.
Really?
They took pictures of you naked.
You were assaulted, but didn't call the cops.
How could you stay focused?
When was the last time you saw Wei Lai?
I haven't seen her since that incident.
- How did she die?
- Just answer the questions.
Understand?
Yes.
Where were you on the night of May 31?
Studying at home.
I study at home every day.
Any witnesses?
It's okay.
We can ask your neighbors.
Hey.
Are you done?
Well?
She doesn't have an alibi.
We have a motive but no evidence.
Let's release her for now.
She has exams tomorrow.
Wang Li, what do you think?
I think her reactions were unusual.
What's the correct reaction?
Crying and screaming?
Don't allow emotions to cloud your judgment.
How do you explain Fang Yongkang's car?
Did Chen Nian steal it?
She's so tiny.
How could she move the body?
What's your problem?
She might have an accomplice.
What's wrong with you?
You're being unprofessional.
Enough.
Calm down, both of you.
A girl just filed a report.
She was almost raped in a park.
She saw the attacker's face.
It fits the serial rapist's description.
Wang Li, the girl is not in...
Release Chen Nian.
Keep her under surveillance.
ANQIAO CITY
COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM CENTER 190
Do you trust me?
Time is up.
Stop writing immediately.
Place your answer sheets on top of the question book.
All rise.
Proctors, please collect the exam papers.
FOLLOW THE RULES,
ELIMINATE CHEATING
- Freeze!
- Stop!
Bastard!
Those are cops behind us.
Didn't you say we can't be seen together?
Scream for help.
There's no time.
Scream for help now.
I stalked and harassed you.
I tried to rape Wei Lai, but accidentally killed her.
No. You didn't.
I left behind evidence.
They're looking for me.
I'll turn myself in!
Chen Nian!
Take a good look.
Don't you see?
I'm a man with nothing.
No brains, no money, and no future.
But I love someone.
I want her to have a happy ending.
I won't leave you.
I'm a minor.
I won't get a harsh sentence.
Once you graduate from university,
I'll already be out.
I'm not going anywhere.
If you succeed,
I won't be a total loser.
You go first.
- Find somewhere safe first.
- No.
Chen Nian, when you're all grown up... we'll meet again, right?
Don't forget.
You still owe me one.
Shut up if you want to live!
Hold him!
Don't move!
Shut up if you want to live!
Help!
You said you were pretending to be the rapist when you assaulted
Zhang Jing and Chen Nian.
Check the records.
My buddies and I were brought in to stand in the lineup.
We were later released.
I'm not the rapist you're looking for.
I don't understand.
You're a good-looking kid.
You could easily get a girlfriend.
Why did you do it?
Take a guess.
If you guess right, I'll tell you.
- If you guess wrong, I won't.
- Shut up!
I don't have time for bullshit!
No more questions.
Just tell me what happened.
Give me all the details.
I told him everything already.
There's nothing more.
I'm telling you.
- Concrete evidence carries more weight.
- Then go find the evidence.
I have nothing to add.
If Li Lifang saw you now...
How would she feel?
I want to give you a chance to redeem yourself.
Our people are tracking down your mom now.
Do you want to see her?
Don't you want to know how she is?
Would you rather confess or see your mom like this?
What do you want?
Get to the point.
Have you seen this girl before?
Her name is Wei Lai.
She was killed and buried.
The lab ran a test and confirmed that tissue found under her nails belongs to you.
Liu Beishan, why did you kill Wei Lai?
DELETE
She would still be alive if she did what she was told.
But she kicked and bit me.
She hurt me, so I pushed her lightly.
Then she died just like that.
I already apologized to the man who called the cops and I also deleted the videos.
The others all listen to me.
See?
What do you want?
Don't report me to the police.
How much money do you want?
I can pay you as much as you want.
Just tell me.
Tell me.
You can film me if you want, Chen Nian.
Hit me!
Yell at me! Slap me!
I can't repeat another grade.
My dad hasn't talked to me in a year.
- Please.
- I don't want to hear it.
You don't need to forgive me.
Just don't file a report.
We all went overboard.
I'm begging you, Chen Nian. I'm so sorry.
Just name your terms.
I'll agree to anything.
I'm begging you.
I can't repeat another year.
I don't want to see you ever again.
Understood.
Wait!
If you don't want to see me again, let's not apply to the same schools.
What's your first choice?
Mine is Peking University.
What's yours?
It's okay if you don't want to tell me.
Let's hope we both do well in the exam.
What a pity.
We could have been friends.
Luo Ting is an idiot and Xu Miao is two-faced.
But you're decent.
My mom was right.
Make friends with good people and life will be easier.
Easier?
Yes.
I took care of the video and you forgave me.
We can both forget about it, like nothing happened.
It's more important to live in the present.
Are you sure you don't want money?
I would feel better if you took some.
You can clear your mom's debts.
Then you two can stop hiding and live with some dignity.
I failed.
You said you never met Liu Beishan.
Your classmate said he saw
Beishan stalking and harassing you.
Do you recall that?
I don't remember.
She puts up a weak act and men flock to protect her.
Are all men such pigs?
Wang Li, I need surveillance footage of Chen Nian's daily commute to school.
Zoom in on the person in grey.
More.
What do you want?
Study, take the exam, and go to a good school.
Become one of the smart ones and find answers.
If possible, protect the world.
Can you do it?
I want to try.
It's a deal.
You protect the world.
I'll protect you.
- Strip her! Take it all off!
- Strip her!
- Take it all off!
- Let me do it.
Strip her!
Strip her!
Tell me if you can't watch anymore.
She'll do anything for money.
What do you mean?
This is good stuff.
But the camera is shaky.
I can't see it clearly.
Which one is Wei Lai?
- I can't tell.
- Why did you skip the middle one?
It's gross.
They're all gross.
You know which one is Wei Lai.
- Strip her!
- Come on!
I don't.
Why are you showing me this?
Maybe you've seen her corpse, so you know what she was wearing when she died.
You should know.
- Chen Nian is here.
- What do I care?
She's next door.
My colleague is interrogating her.
Was it my fault that I got bullied?
I'm sorry about what you've been through, but if you had trusted us adults, we could have helped you.
Who can help me?
The ones who filmed me?
Or the onlookers?
Or the ones who blame me for being targeted?
You took matters into your own hands.
You confronted Wei Lai and took revenge.
Revenge may seem normal to most people.
But those of us who keep enduring it just to get through the college entrance exam are considered wrong?
If this is how the world works, would you want to bring a child into this world?
Get me a pack of cigarettes.
Okay.
You are Chen Nian's friend.
So am I.
You want to help her, so do I.
But kid, you're too naive.
You thought you had a perfect plan, but we saw through you right away.
Do you think cops are idiots?
Even if you keep quiet,
Chen Nian is still a prime suspect.
Do you get what I'm saying?
We're alone now.
Tell me what happened, so I can figure out how to help you two.
Drop the act.
Aren't you tired?
Tell the other guy to come back in.
Fine, I'll be blunt.
You and Chen Nian know each other.
She was bullied and you wanted justice, so you two killed Wei Lai together.
You uneducated fool.
Chen Nian volunteered to come today.
Do you want to know what she confessed?
Thanks.
We don't need your confession.
Chen Nian broke down.
Chen Nian, what do you know about the world?
You held out but she couldn't.
She confessed everything.
What do you know about convicts?
Do you know how rapists are treated in prison?
Everyone will gang up on him.
Even if you want to sacrifice yourself for someone else, you should first ask yourself if she would be able to live with it.
Is this what you want?
You go to heaven while someone else rots in hell.
You accused me of letting someone else take the fall for me and leaving him to rot in hell.
Who did you mean?
You said that even if I want to sacrifice myself, she wouldn't be able to live with it.
Who did you mean?
You said everybody wants to help me.
But who can actually help me?
Why do you insist that I'm helping her?
What do I get from it?
I'll say it again.
Drop the act.
I'm not making anyone take the fall for me.
I, Liu Beishan, am not an idiot.
Wei Lai's death had nothing to do with me.
I only kissed and molested her, but I don't know her.
I never met Liu Beishan before.
Have you considered the severity of the sentence for such crimes?
Hey.
Zheng Yi!
The suspect cannot meet with the victim!
Zheng Yi!
Both of you have been lying from the beginning!
Once we submit the report, you won't ever see her again! Have you ever thought of that?
I don't know him.
Why don't we get to know each other now?
Chen Nian!
- Listen to me!
- Calm down!
Can't you just trust me?
- Get up!
- Calm down, Zheng Yi!
Do you really know what you're doing?
- Zheng Yi!
- Listen to me, Chen Nian!
- Calm down!
- Just trust me!
- Zheng Yi!
- Chen Nian!
You were protective of Chen Nian.
Why are you now accusing her of murdering Wei Lai?
If someone spends decades in prison for her, she won't be able to live with it.
No one would take the rap for murder and rape just to protect someone.
We wouldn't.
But they're still teenagers.
What's wrong?
We shouldn't be seen together.
I don't care.
It's not that simple.
Keep walking.
I'll be right behind you.
What will you do behind me?
Nothing.

The entrance exam results are out today.
- What's your score?
- First choice universities' entry score is 548.
- Next is 494.
- It's 632.
TOTAL SCORE
How did you score so high?
I can't believe it!
All of your efforts pay off now.
We made it.
Good people get good karma.
Nian, I love you.
I love you!
Let's eat!
Keep quiet. I'll go check.
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.
I was nearby.
I came by to congratulate you.
You're free now.
How do you feel?
I mean, the feeling of becoming an adult.
How does it feel?
Don't want to talk to me anymore?
I understand.
You're still mad at me for suspecting you.
I was disciplined for what happened.
I guess I'll go.
I'll see you off when you leave for Beijing.
By the way,
I have good news for you.
A few days ago,
Liu Beishan received a death sentence.
Due to the severity of his crimes and his previous criminal records, the court quickly reached a verdict.
Isn't he a minor?
He lied to you.
Liu Beishan is an adult.
He would have to bear legal responsibility even if he were a minor.
Chen Nian.
Go away!
Why?
Why can't you leave us alone?
Why is it so hard to let us be?
Just let one of us be free!
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that? Why?
Leave!
I'm sorry, I lied!
There's no verdict yet.
He'll be put away for decades, but you could be out in a few years!
Hate me all you want!
I just want what's best for both of you!
Inmate 178, you have a visitor!
A good student... and a small-time punk.
Must you drag both of them down?
You've come a long way.
Where are you going?
To sleep. I'm tired.
Beishan.
I feel much more relaxed now.
It's the same feeling I had when I finished my last exam.
Really?
Did your teacher's prediction come true?
Yes.
What was the composition topic?
A letter to 20 years into the future.
Are you afraid?
I was.
Now, just a little bit.
And you?
I was a little bit afraid... but not anymore.
If you could go back, would you do it all over again?
Answer me.
There is no "if".
Besides...
I don't wish for such a scenario.

Does anyone know the difference between "was" and "used to be"?
Anyone?
"Was" means it has passed.
In fact, both of them mean that it has passed.
But the difference is that "used to be" carries a sense of loss.
Does everybody understand?
Let's go over the tenses again.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Bullying might be happening all around us.
Schools are on the frontline in preventing bullying.
However, school bullying goes beyond campus borders.
In 2016, the Ministry of Education and eight other ministries implemented 11 initiatives to control bullying on campus, including preventions, penalties, and long-term deployments.
In November 2017, the Ministry of Education and ten other ministries initiated the Anti-bullying
Intervention Program for Primary and
Secondary Schools.
In 2018, municipal governments introduced regulations to control school bullying in accordance to the State Council's guidance.
When family, society, the law, and each one of us come together and join forces we can protect our younger generations and the world from bullying.
