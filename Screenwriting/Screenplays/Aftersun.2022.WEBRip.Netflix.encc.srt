[Calum] That's not embarrassing.
[Sophie] Wait.
-What?
-I was gonna interview you.
Oh, you were, were you?
What were you gonna interview me about?
[Sophie] I don't know.
-Well…
-Well, I just turned 11, and you are 130, turning 131 in 2 days.

So, just bear with us. All right?

Hello?
Hi. It's, um, 501.
Yeah, that's us.
Yeah, um, I booked a room with two beds, but we've only got the one here.
Yeah, okay, well, I paid for it, and, um, it was confirmed by the travel agency.
Okay, that's all you can do?
[softly] Okay. Scooch under. There we go.
Oh, it'll have to be then.
Okay. Thanks.
Mmm, good night.

Sorry about the hotel.
Clive was just here, said he had a great time.
[hammering, clanging]
Everything okay at home?
What do you mean?
I mean, how are you and your mum getting along?
Yeah, okay, I guess.
Good.
I'm glad.
Why? What did she tell you?
She didn't say anything.
You just told me you weren't getting along that well last time I saw you. Remember?
Can't exactly ask you when I phone you at home.
Oh, yeah. Right.
Things have been better.
Why don't you go over and introduce yourself?
-Dad, no. They're, like, kids.
-Mmm-hmm.
Why don't you go over and introduce yourself?
Mmm. Sophie, they're, like, old.
[Calum chuckles]
[Calum] Hmm. See, if you let it rest on an object for a wee while, it gets the lighting right.
That's quite clever.
[somber music playing]
[Sophie and Calum laugh]
-You want a massive ice cream?
-Yeah, that's bigger than my head.
[Calum] That's impossible.
You have a massive head. [chuckles]
-[Sophie] Are you done?
-[chuckling] What?
-That's a bit rude.
-No, it's not. It's just a fact.
[Sophie] Your head's bigger than mine.
[Calum] I…
I would disagree with that fact.
Look at the size of it. [laughing]
Your head's bigger. See?

-[Sophie] And bye-bye.
[Calum whispers]
And your dad's being amazing.

Oh. I'll do it when I'm home.
School doesn't start until Thursday, right?
Okay.
Yeah, it's good.
We're not actually at our hotel.
But ours doesn't have a phone, so…
Dad?
He's good.
Oh, my God, he's doing some weird slow-motion ninja moves.
Why is he so weird sometimes?
But, yeah, he's good.
All right. Love you. Bye.
[knocks on door]
-Mum wants to talk to you.
-What?
-Mum wants to talk to you.
-Right.
[Calum] Thanks, poppet.
Hey.

[girl 1] So, are you gonna do anything?
-[girl 2] What do you mean?
-[toilet flushing]
[girl 1] With George.
He told Seb he wanted to.
With you, I mean.
Not Seb, obviously.
Last night, on the way home, I gave Kenny…
Literally in the bushes behind the other pool.
[girl 2] Well, like, what happened?
-[girl 1] What do you mean?
-[girl 2] Did he come?
[girl 1] Yeah. I mean, obviously.

-You don't mind, do you?
-No bother.
Right. Last one for now, then, okay?
Do you want a game of doubles?
Yeah, sure.
-[boy] You've got a built-in rest there.
-[chuckles] No danger.
I'm right-handed, and I'm playing with a kid, right?
Go easy.
-You wanna break, or…
-Yeah.
[Calum] Good.
-[pool ball strikes]
-Well done.
[balls rolling]
So, what's your sister's name?
-Uh, Sophie.
-Oh, nice.
I'm her dad, though, actually.
-[boy] Oh. Sorry, mate, I just thought--
-[Calum] That's okay.
-[Calum] It's a nice hotel, eh?
-[boy] Yeah, it's all right.
We're staying in that one over the road.
-Basically a building site, so…
-[chuckles]

Fucking hell, Sophie. Impressive.
Hey, don't say… [whispers] …"fuck."

[kids screaming excitedly]
[pool water splashing]

You want to ruin it again for everybody, as usual.

[Calum] Twist.
-[Sophie grunts]
-Nope. Keep your…
-I'm not letting you off. Go again.
-[grunts]
No, you're just pushing.
Look, you have to twist.
Like, here.
Okay? Again.
No. Okay, grab my wrists.
Okay, okay, I get it.
So, the thin part lines up to where the fingers connect, okay?
-Are you looking?
-Okay. Mmm-hmm.
And then you pull as hard as you can, like that.
-Ow!
-No, this is serious, Sophie.
Look at me. It's important you get this.
Go.
No. You're not twisting, you're just pulling.
-Okay, again. Look, grab my wrists.
-I can't twist.
Thin part lines up to where the fingers connect.
Okay? And you pull as hard as you can.
-[softly] Okay.
-This is serious, Sophie.
It's important you get this.
So that you can defend yourself.
So that if anyone ever tries to attack you, you can break free and get away.
What if someone tries to attack me some other way?
Without grabbing my wrists?
[somber music playing]
[Sophie] I think it's nice that we share the same sky.
What you mean?
Well, like, sometimes at playtime,
I look up to the sky, and if I can see the sun, then I think about the fact that we can both see the sun.
So, even though we're not actually in the same place, and we're not actually together, we kind of are in a way, you know?
Like, we're both underneath the same sky, so… we're kind of together.
One. Head under.
-[speaks indistinctly]

Three.
Four.
Four and a half…
-Stop, stop.

[Calum] You okay, Soph?
-[pop song playing on speakers]
-[indistinct chatter]
[Sophie] You've not mentioned Claire.
Hmm? Um…
Remember she had a boyfriend when we first met?
Yup.
I was like, "Who's that on the phone?"
You were like, "Oh, just this girl I like, but she's already going out with someone."
Yeah, well, they got back together.
Aw. I liked her.
Mmm-hmm. Me, too.
So, does that mean you're not gonna open the café?
Café?
Uh, no. Not anymore.
But… I've got this new thing going with Keith.
What is it?
Well, we're still figuring it out exactly, but we're thinking of renting a house a wee bit outside London to work from.
You'd have your own room for when you come down.
-Yes. Can I paint it yellow?
-Yellow?
Why yellow?
I like the idea of a yellow room, but Mum doesn't let me paint my room yellow.
[chuckles]
[sing-song]
You're trying to get me into trouble.
Well, can I, though?
Aye, we'll see.

Um, I didn't think it was broken then.
I'd never broken anything before.
[grunts softly]
[Sophie] I've never broken anything before.
[Calum] Mmm.
-How come you and Mum say, "Love you"?
-What?
Like, on the phone.
You're not together, so why would you say it?
Well…
Think of all the people you say it to.
Like, your nana, granddad, uncle, aunties, right?
Yeah, but they're, like, family.
Well, your mother is family.
[Sophie] I remember one time
I asked Mum if she'd phoned you.
-[Calum groans softly]
-And she said that you were engaged.
Like, I didn't know why, but I thought that meant that you were getting married, like, both of youse.
Like, I didn't know if I thought that about just you or both of you, but…
[Calum grunts, winces]
Isn't that funny?
Well, I didn't know what it meant at the time.
I didn't know that it meant that you were just on the phone to somebody else.
I was kind of excited.
About us getting married?
Yeah. I was really young, though.

I don't know, like, seven.

The mask. I know it was expensive.

It's fine.
I'm just a little tired today, that's all.
Can you run up and grab the camera?
It's in the bag.

Not as much as I was missing home, to be honest.
And I'm going to have a baby soon.
-[chuckles] Congratulations.
-Yeah.
A few years ago, I thought I would be at least 40 before all that, but…
[Calum] I can't see myself at 40, to be honest.

My name is Sophie Lesley Patterson reporting live from…
I don't know the name of this boat.
Um, but, basically,
I have just went and done the most amazing thing in my whole entire life.
So, we went, like, scuba diving thing.
And there was actually, like, a sea horse, and it wrapped round my, like, whole finger.
Then when I got out, there was an… octopus, and the instructor person…
I don't know.
Like, yeah, instructor put it on… put an octopus on my head.
A real-life octopus on my head.
Yeah, but right now, Dad…
I mean, Calum Aaron Patterson… is away on some scuba diving thing, I think.
I can't remember, but…
Yeah, he doesn't actually have a diving licence,
'cause he told a porky pie.

No, Soph. Scooch back.
Lift your hair a sec.
There you go.
Let's do something, eh?
Get this day going.
Like what?
Water polo?
No, I'm not a good enough swimmer for that.
[Calum] You're a great swimmer, Soph.
You know it.
Go on.
It's our last few days, and it'll be fun, okay?

Can we have a big round of applause for Calum and Sophie?
-[people cheering, applauding]
-[Calum] Oh, you didn't sign us up?
Of course I did. We've done it every holiday since I was, like, five.
Maybe you're a little old for it now, Soph.
What are you talking about, Dad?
Those girls were, like, 50.
Okay, let it go.
He'll move on in a second.

-Idiot.
Where you going?
Supposed to be going home, but I got lost
'cause everything looks the same at night.
Well, why don't you come hang out with us?

[Calum] Thank you.

Sophie, come on, let's get up.
It's time to go.
[somber music continues]
Careful with those.
A man died not paying attention to how to put those on properly.
The lug went right up his nose and punctured his brain.
-That's not true.
-It is.
Happy birthday, Dad.
Thanks, darling.
[Calum] Okay.
[laughing] You're copying me?
[Sophie laughs]
All right, smartarse.
Attention!
[Sophie] Oh, what's this we're doing?
[Calum] Yeah, I tricked you.
[Calum chuckles]
[Calum exhaling deeply]
-[Sophie] I'm still copying, you know?
-I know.
[Sophie] Exactly.
[Calum] And now copy this.
[Calum breathing deeply]
Breathe.
-[Sophie chuckles]
-Right, you watching?
-Yeah.
-Feet together. Up.
[Calum breathing deeply]
-Up…
-[Sophie grunts] One.
-…and down.
-Two.
-[Sophie] Up…
-Up.
-[Sophie] …and…
-Down.
Now close your eyes and do it.
And focus on your breathing.

-[Sophie] What's that smell?
-It's where we go after this.
If it's good enough for Cleopatra…
It's kind of amazing how Cleopatra was, like, here.
Like, right here.
Yeah.
Before she was…
-By a snake.
-[chuckles]
Well, I mean, it was kind of suicide.
It wasn't for sure there was a snake.
Nobody ever found a snake, so…
-It might've just been a needle.
-How do you know that?
We learnt about Egypt last term.
What happened to your shoulder?
I don't really know.
I'm sorry I passed out on your bed.
It's fine.
I didn't have a key, though.
How'd you get in?
Reception.
[clears throat, hesitates]
I'm so sorry, Soph. Yesterday was…
It's fine. It's no big deal.
No, it is a big deal.
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry, okay?
-Thank you.
-[chuckles]
-You've got none on your arms.
-Uh… I did.
No, you don't.
Now you do.
Let's see your back.
-My back?
-Yup.
Right, I need to get a big clump for this big back.
[Calum chuckles]
-[Calum] Oh!
-[both laughing]
[Calum] Careful with my shoulder.
-It's okay.
-[Sophie chuckles] Sorry.
[Calum] Did you have fun last night?
[Sophie] Yeah.
This boy, Michael…
I met him on the motorbike game.
Yeah.
We… We kissed last night.
He kissed me, and then we kissed.
[Calum] He's your age, though?
[Sophie] Yeah.
[Calum] Well, that's okay, right?
Peck on the cheek?
[Sophie] Well…
-[chuckles shyly] Yeah, not exactly.
-[chuckles] Okay.
[Calum] I want you to know that you can talk to me about anything.
As you get older, you know.
Whatever parties you go to… boys you meet, drugs you take.
-[Sophie] Dad!
-No, I'm serious, Soph.
I've done it all. You can, too.
I just want you to promise me you'll talk to me about it, okay?
[Sophie] Okay.
But I'm never gonna do any of that anyway.
[Calum] That's okay, too.
But if you do, remember, okay?
[insects trilling]
[Sophie] On the count of three we're going to sing.
On the count of three we're gonna sing.
