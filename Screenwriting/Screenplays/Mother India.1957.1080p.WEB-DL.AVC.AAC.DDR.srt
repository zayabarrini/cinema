1
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:42,130
The water canal has reached
our village, Mother.

2
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:45,132
The villagers want you
to inaugurate it.

3
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:50,866
She refuses! You are our mother,
the mother of the whole village!

4
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:54,380
Either you inaugurate it
or it will remain untouched!

5
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:55,882
Mother, please...

6
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:56,281
l speak the truth.

7
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:01,009
The wedding was so grand that
everybody is talking about it.

8
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:07,018
Of course. God has blessed
me with just one son.

9
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:11,423
Nobody in our village holds
a torch to the bride in beauty.

10
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:15,289
Of what use is mere beauty?
She should be talented, too.

11
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:18,796
lf God desires, she will be.

12
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:22,803
l've heard something...
The villagers would say...

13
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:26,011
Why have you stopped? Go on.

14
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:29,273
Aunt, please don't feel offended.

15
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:35,018
People say that you have mortgaged
your land for the wedding.

16
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:37,923
Mortgaged my land!

17
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,053
Let them say that in front of me!
l'll knock their teeth out!

18
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:46,421
What hasn't God given me?
Don't l possess land?

19
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,926
Plow? Bullocks?

20
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:54,529
l've mortgaged land!

21
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:59,440
Why are the villagers jealous?!

22
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:01,571
My foot!

23
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:09,154
l have mortgaged the land.

24
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:13,687
lf l wouldn't, how could
l celebrate the marriage?

25
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:16,659
Who doesn't do it?

26
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:23,158
lf the bride is fortunate enough,
we'll get it released, too.

27
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:25,932
She does look lucky.

28
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:03,972
Let me do something.

29
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:06,370
Fine. You do it.

30
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:21,060
What have you done? A new bride
and you've removed yourjewellery!

31
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:24,188
Think of me, if not yourself.

32
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:27,063
l haven't yet seen you properly.

33
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,693
- Wear them.
- Sell them.

34
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:33,302
- Are you mad?
- lt will lighten the burden.

35
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,571
What burden?

36
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:38,307
Mother has mortgaged the land.

37
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:41,578
That's a pack of lies!
The villagers make up stories!

38
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:45,715
And even if she has, l'll throw the
money in the lender's face very soon!

39
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:50,490
Somebody will see!
Mother might come. Let go.

40
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,082
- So what?
- Won't you feel shy?

41
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:54,226
Dump the shame in your basket!

42
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,723
- l wish mother comes.
- Let her.

43
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:09,700
l swear... they look good on you.

44
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:17,447
l pray that they always remain
in my hands for you to see.

45
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,980
Why won't they when l'm around?

46
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:22,451
Then l'll take them off everyday.

47
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:26,492
So you can put them on.

48
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:36,864
Shameless man!

49
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:43,501
Are you the only man in the
village to have got married?

50
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:46,609
Anybody who sees this
will spit at you!

51
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:56,188
And you too, daughter-in-law!
What can l say...

52
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:59,224
Why should l blame you?
His father too was like him.

53
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,893
Look at this! Light the fire first.

54
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,360
What are you cooking? Your head?

55
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:14,806
Don't drop it.

56
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,305
Listen ...

57
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,451
Don't let him come too close.

58
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:32,683
Stop it.

59
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:34,823
He'll become worthless.

60
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:53,301
Dear Kamla, walk carefully
lest your foot slips.

61
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:58,606
- This is a woman's foot
not a man's. - Let's go.

62
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:02,852
You are offended. l meant the pot.

63
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:05,519
lt's an earthen pot. Might break.

64
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:10,254
With you alive, who can have
a copper pot on their heads?

65
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:14,763
l want you to have pots
made of gold on your heads.

66
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,867
But nobody cares. What times!

67
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:20,397
Why are you arguing
with him? Let's go.

68
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:23,536
Go and rinse your mouth.
lt stinks!

69
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:27,271
- Who is he?
- The village grocer.

70
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:31,278
But he has a wicked heart.
We'll go together with lunch.

71
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:46,690
You've come. Shamu's Radha has come

72
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,728
You really take very long!

73
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:51,737
Sit down.

74
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:59,105
l think you should come here
with me in the morning itself.

75
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,473
- And lunch?
- Don't worry about food.

76
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:05,214
You are all l need.

77
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:09,015
Delicious!

78
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:12,750
- You cook very well.
- ls the salt okay?

79
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:16,253
Don't talk about salt.

80
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,924
You must only touch food.

81
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:25,062
Everything will turn salty. You
don't know how salty your hands are!

82
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:27,306
Where? See...

83
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:38,347
The salt of the entire
village is in your hands!

84
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:45,489
l swear. Let me see...
ln two days your henna has faded.

85
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:50,657
- So what?
- Nothing? You don't understand.

86
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:55,796
A new bride shouldn't work
so hard. l feel hurt.

87
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:59,663
New bride? lt's 2 days
since we got married.

88
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:04,540
lt's not a few years!
Remain spruced for 2 months.

89
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,669
This time won't return.
Let the other brides be jealous.

90
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:11,040
Keep away. Somebody might watch us.

91
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,678
- Nobody will see us.
- Let me go.

92
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,552
This is a big problem!

93
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:20,180
At home, you're scared of mother;
And here, the world! Are we sinning?

94
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:23,192
Then the kids will come by!

95
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:28,055
You're already counting the kids?

96
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:33,698
- When God gives us the day...
- Gives? Of course He will.

97
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:36,466
When we have children...

98
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:41,569
A couple won't do. l need
4 healthy sons for the plow.

99
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:42,939
One for each corner.

100
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:53,581
Shambhu? Just wait!

101
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:55,325
What's the matter?

102
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:57,363
Shameless!

103
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:20,281
Come and take some grains.
l'm very happy today.

104
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:23,394
You also come and take some.

105
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:27,066
What are you doing?

106
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:29,398
You also take some.

107
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:31,430
Be a little patient.

108
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:36,038
You're not the only one to
become a father. Hold back.

109
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:42,804
What do you know of the
joy of the birth of a son?

110
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:44,711
You also take some.

111
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,080
Aunt!

112
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:51,687
Your voice sounds as it were
coming from a torn drum!

113
00:21:52,157 --> 00:21:55,490
- First congratulate us.
- You're worried about wishes?

114
00:21:55,794 --> 00:21:59,252
And your son is ruining me!
He's destroying the crop!

115
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:04,358
lf he must, let him
distribute his own share.

116
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,762
Why is he touching my share?

117
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:09,433
- Three fourths is our share.
- You keep forgetting.

118
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,939
- Three parts are mine.
- What? - Of course.

119
00:22:13,345 --> 00:22:14,437
- Three are mine!
- No, mine.

120
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,508
This is cheating.

121
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:19,012
Get us to put our
thumb-impression on anything!

122
00:22:19,284 --> 00:22:21,115
l'll complain to the Panchayat!

123
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:29,019
Think and decide, brothers.

124
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:31,129
l help you in times of need.

125
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:38,265
Till the principal amount
of rupees 500 is not paid...

126
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:42,541
..3 parts of my crop ofjowar
and pulses will go to...

127
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:46,773
- ...the moneylender as interest.
- Hear that?

128
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:48,776
And here is her thumb impression.

129
00:22:49,314 --> 00:22:53,148
Now tell the Village Council that
this is not your thumb-impression!

130
00:22:53,352 --> 00:22:55,684
God knows what nonsense you write!

131
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:58,785
Talk of what we spoke.
l believe in spoken words.

132
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:03,518
Didn't you say that one part of the
crop will be yours and 3 ours?

133
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:08,392
Giving her due respect for
her age, l was being lenient.

134
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:12,799
l gave her the money.
l couldn't even lift the bag.

135
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:16,396
lf you'll hang me for this,
l'll go straight to court!

136
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:19,544
Who is afraid of courts?

137
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:23,145
The courts are fair.
You'll be jailed instead!

138
00:23:23,315 --> 00:23:28,275
Listen to him!
He'll have me jailed!

139
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:33,923
lf l don't get the police and
claim the land, l'm not man enough!

140
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,529
No, the police should
never enter our village!

141
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:40,026
- Decide the issue here and now.
- What do you say?

142
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:42,024
The police mustn't come here.

143
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:44,931
Then you decide this.

144
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:48,173
What do you decide?

145
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:53,340
lf it's the written word,
then you have to give it.

146
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:57,708
Make Shamu also put his
thumb impression on this.

147
00:23:57,883 --> 00:24:01,478
One can't trust this old lady.
She's alive today. She may die soon.

148
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:04,222
You'll die with your family!

149
00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:06,759
l'll go only after you're dead!

150
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:10,129
You bullied the Council
into deciding in your favour!

151
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:14,463
You're cheating my kids!
l pray to God to punish you!

152
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:17,864
As long as l live, my son won't put
his thumb impression! Let's go.

153
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:40,905
- Don't give him.
- Why?

154
00:27:41,206 --> 00:27:45,939
- He hasn't made me a catapult.
- l'll make it. Don't be angry.

155
00:27:48,347 --> 00:27:50,474
What is going on?

156
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:55,709
Whom did you think this
belongs to? Beggars!

157
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:58,987
- Put it back!
- He won't.

158
00:27:59,758 --> 00:28:01,988
The son is one step ahead
of his father!

159
00:28:02,627 --> 00:28:06,791
Now, my boy...
This has my share, too.

160
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:09,167
You didn't plow the field.

161
00:28:09,468 --> 00:28:14,565
l've plowed 500 bucks
in your father's life.

162
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:17,442
- Come here.
- What is it?

163
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,845
You're a thief!

164
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:21,938
- A thief?
- Yes.

165
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:27,808
- Yes. You are a thief!
- Stay away!

166
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:31,083
lf l get angry, you've had it!

167
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:32,815
Go and stop him.

168
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:35,318
Doesn't matter. Let him be.

169
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:40,929
My umbrella costing 5.50!

170
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:47,028
l swear l'll add this money also
to your account! Remember that!

171
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,938
He's ruined my umbrella!

172
00:28:54,346 --> 00:28:57,679
- Give it to him.
- My umbrella!

173
00:28:57,849 --> 00:28:59,180
Return it.

174
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,215
Throwing it away? l've added
5.50 to your account!

175
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:13,686
Your son would have
thrashed that man today.

176
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:17,201
Grandma is a liar!

177
00:29:17,502 --> 00:29:20,835
- l was going to beat Ramu.
- But why?

178
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:24,870
- He asked me to steal jaggery.
- He stole it, not me!

179
00:29:27,145 --> 00:29:29,739
- Why...
- Sit down!

180
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:31,916
He's a devil!

181
00:29:32,184 --> 00:29:35,779
Don't call me a devil.
l'll fight back.

182
00:29:52,137 --> 00:29:55,732
- Mother, l'll eat with you.
- Me, too.

183
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:38,246
Tell us a story!

184
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:43,610
All right. Once upon a time,
there used to be a mouse.

185
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:46,052
- He had four tails.
- Don't tell lies!

186
00:30:46,224 --> 00:30:50,684
A mouse does not have 4 tails.
lt has just one.

187
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:55,261
l'll tell you a story
about a lion.

188
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:58,728
l strangled its neck...

189
00:30:59,037 --> 00:31:04,942
He started limping.
Then l sat astride the horse.

190
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:06,711
And l escaped...

191
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:16,245
And l find a lion. l pick
it up and carry it home.

192
00:31:16,888 --> 00:31:19,982
And l pet it gently.

193
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:23,987
Then he dies.

194
00:31:24,262 --> 00:31:31,100
Then l bring another lion
and keep it in another house.

195
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,697
Then a mouse comes slowly...

196
00:31:35,774 --> 00:31:38,368
And l kill it.

197
00:31:40,178 --> 00:31:42,772
Don't stop. Learn it fast.

198
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:46,017
- Sir.
- Greetings.

199
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:49,688
You've brought the younger one too.

200
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:51,781
That's very nice.

201
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:57,025
People say education
makes a man soft hearted.

202
00:31:57,429 --> 00:32:01,160
They just say it.
Am l soft hearted?

203
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:06,893
Teach him carefully or
he'll teach you some things.

204
00:32:07,305 --> 00:32:13,141
Don't you worry. l have
set many rascals right.

205
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,709
Teach him that much...

206
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:22,075
..that he is able to read
all the money lender's books.

207
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:26,088
Even the English
can't read his books.

208
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:30,623
- l'll read them!
- Go and sit in your place.

209
00:32:30,895 --> 00:32:34,126
Don't punish my child.

210
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:39,192
Without that, one can't
gain any knowledge.

211
00:32:39,871 --> 00:32:42,840
l must have been punished
at least 250 times.

212
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,975
Only then have l learnt a little.

213
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,344
lt's essential to be punished.

214
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:53,840
Thank God we are not educated
or he would have punished us too!

215
00:32:58,256 --> 00:33:00,224
Look at him!

216
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:03,651
Get up! Why are you bent over?

217
00:33:03,962 --> 00:33:08,558
What are you doing here?
Go and sit in your seat.

218
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,425
- l know everything!
- What do you know?

219
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:18,067
Go to your place!

220
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:20,806
Why are you beating my brother?

221
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:22,310
Standing up for his brother!
First you bend over!

222
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,710
Bend like a chicken!

223
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:32,083
Put away the catapult!

224
00:33:32,557 --> 00:33:35,651
You're punishing my brother!
l won't spare you!

225
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:40,724
Remain bound till morning.

226
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:46,729
lf you give him dinner,
l'll be really angry with you!

227
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:49,499
Beats somebody!
Throws somebody's turban!

228
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:51,239
Throws stones! What is this?

229
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:55,104
The moon sits faraway
and eats in a plate.

230
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:57,344
Grandma dies.

231
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:59,981
Father got scared.

232
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:02,014
Grandma will die!

233
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:09,886
- You'll sleep hungry tonight.
- Mother will give me dinner.

234
00:34:11,029 --> 00:34:15,989
Give you dinner! Daughter-in-law...

235
00:34:17,068 --> 00:34:21,732
lf you feed him, l'll tie you
up in his place. Be warned!

236
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:22,736
Be warned!

237
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:53,201
She's gone to sleep.
Get my dinner.

238
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,848
No dear. Leave my legs.

239
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:14,353
- Go and untie him.
- Whom?

240
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:18,852
- Your son.
- Let him be.

241
00:35:18,997 --> 00:35:23,957
lt's so late. Go and untie him
and give him something to eat.

242
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:26,294
What's the hurry? l'll give it.

243
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:31,531
What a mother you are! ln your
place l'd have fed him hours ago.

244
00:35:32,777 --> 00:35:35,143
- He's eating.
- Eating?

245
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:37,144
You gave him food without asking me!

246
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:40,145
- Am l dead?
- Grandma is dead!

247
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:11,479
- What are you eating?
- Grams with jaggery.

248
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:15,849
What's your name?

249
00:36:19,157 --> 00:36:21,751
Get lost! That's a boy's name.

250
00:36:22,894 --> 00:36:26,352
Should l tell you the truth?
My name is Rupa.

251
00:36:36,774 --> 00:36:38,867
What madness is this?

252
00:36:39,143 --> 00:36:40,872
He's just a child.

253
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,283
He's stealing the grams from
the girl's hands! Robbery!

254
00:36:47,185 --> 00:36:49,016
Give it back to her.

255
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,414
l want to talk to you.
Give him some jaggery.

256
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,789
Here. Come in.

257
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:01,560
There's a month or so before
the crop can be harvested.

258
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,934
l wanted a quintal ofjowar.
There's nothing to eat at home.

259
00:37:06,204 --> 00:37:08,434
So you eat me.

260
00:37:09,107 --> 00:37:11,575
l swear l'm fed up
of giving you loans.

261
00:37:11,976 --> 00:37:14,069
No sign of paying back
what you've already taken.

262
00:37:14,345 --> 00:37:16,313
Don't you take 3 parts of our crop?

263
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:20,815
That's the interest.
The principal is as it is.

264
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,586
Should our kids starve to death?

265
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:28,414
Let not the kids starve.
What have you brought to pawn?

266
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:33,189
To pawn? Don't you trust me?

267
00:37:33,464 --> 00:37:39,425
lt's not that. lf you ask for
a kilo or so l won't think twice.

268
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:44,333
But a quintal! Don't feel hurt
but l'm sitting here for business.

269
00:37:44,742 --> 00:37:47,472
I have a motherIess chiId to rear.

270
00:37:47,745 --> 00:37:49,713
l have to collect money for her.

271
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:52,950
lf nothing else, your
daughter-in-law has ornaments.

272
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:56,584
- Don't you dare talk of her!
- All right. l won't.

273
00:37:56,854 --> 00:37:58,583
You have some copper
and bronze vessels?

274
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:02,221
- Yes!
- Then get them.

275
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:05,363
Tell your mother
to give the vessels.

276
00:38:05,363 --> 00:38:07,331
To throw at his face!

277
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,830
l won't give them! He's a thief!

278
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:14,204
l won't give them! He's a thief!

279
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:22,071
ln what will we cook?
And store water?

280
00:38:24,115 --> 00:38:29,451
He says he'll give the grain
only if we give our vessels.

281
00:38:29,988 --> 00:38:32,718
- Give it.
- l don't want his grain!

282
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:36,594
- Give it son.
- l won't! lt's my plate!

283
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:42,726
lf you don't give this plate,
your father will sleep hungry.

284
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:46,862
Ramu will be hungry.

285
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:50,471
Your grandma will be hungry.

286
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:59,245
My mother will also starve.

287
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:05,889
Will you also starve?

288
00:39:07,659 --> 00:39:08,887
l don't want it.

289
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,191
Come down and have lunch.

290
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:47,089
- l don't want it. You eat.
- Got a little late.

291
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:48,226
The fire wouldn't light.

292
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:51,961
- Begged for grain?
- No, don't say that.

293
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:56,103
Why not? l say you shouldn't
have brought food today!

294
00:39:56,507 --> 00:39:59,340
- You would have been hungry.
- So what? God would feel ashamed.

295
00:39:59,644 --> 00:40:01,612
Gives us birth but doesn't feed us!

296
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:04,473
Eat something.

297
00:40:06,017 --> 00:40:08,850
So the vessels have
reached the money lender!

298
00:40:10,154 --> 00:40:13,988
l have thought of a plan.
We have 5 acres of land...

299
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:16,724
lt's lying barren with only grass.

300
00:40:16,994 --> 00:40:19,963
We'll cultivate it.
The money lender doesn't own it.

301
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:22,500
ls it easy to break that land?

302
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,469
Half the land is full of stones
and the other half with thick roots!

303
00:40:25,636 --> 00:40:27,228
My oxen will die in 2 days.

304
00:40:28,506 --> 00:40:31,737
The oxen will die later.
First the moneylender will kill us.

305
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,842
I'II start breaking the Iand
right from tomorrow.

306
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:18,620
l had told you this land
is only full of boulders!

307
00:42:16,113 --> 00:42:18,445
You are so broken hearted
just because an ox died?

308
00:42:18,716 --> 00:42:21,549
l'm not dead. l can
always lend you 100 bucks.

309
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:27,822
l believe if man can't help
another, l'd rather shoot him!

310
00:42:29,227 --> 00:42:30,956
- Aunt!
- You be quiet mother!

311
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:35,689
- lf you don't leave, you've had it.
- What crime have l committed?

312
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:37,963
Am l a thief? A dacoit?

313
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,337
Leave him!

314
00:42:40,872 --> 00:42:43,602
- He will die!
- Let him!

315
00:42:44,876 --> 00:42:49,108
Let him go!

316
00:42:52,149 --> 00:42:55,243
He's killed me!

317
00:42:55,386 --> 00:42:57,354
Thank God nobody saw.

318
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:03,353
Be prepared for tomorrow. l'll
confiscate your field, house, ox..

319
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:05,993
Then call me a sweeper
not a money lender!

320
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:08,732
l'll strip the clothes
off your back!

321
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:15,361
- Give me my turban!
- Your father is a rat!

322
00:43:15,773 --> 00:43:18,367
Return my turban! You rat!

323
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:22,741
- Give it back!
- You rat!

324
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:25,473
- Return it.
- l won't!

325
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:33,980
Doesn't matter. Are you watching?

326
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:39,252
l'm taking this as a remembrance.

327
00:43:39,664 --> 00:43:41,632
l say, murderer!

328
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:45,895
lf you treat him like this,
how will we survive?

329
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,400
- He's no God!
- Not God?

330
00:43:48,673 --> 00:43:52,006
Then ask your God for another ox.

331
00:43:52,176 --> 00:43:54,144
With what face can l
now ask him for money?

332
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:58,771
Why do you need to beg for money?
Let everyone die like the ox died!

333
00:43:59,216 --> 00:44:02,811
Let everyone die!
You are very arrogant!

334
00:44:02,987 --> 00:44:05,717
- We eat thanks to him!
- l'll burn such food!

335
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,621
- No!
- Move aside!

336
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:16,262
- Leave it!
- My kids are hungry!

337
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:19,528
My children are hungry!

338
00:45:33,411 --> 00:45:35,379
Get an ox with this.

339
00:46:45,816 --> 00:46:47,784
WeII done.

340
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:50,417
Good Radha. Almost done.

341
00:46:50,588 --> 00:46:51,054
A little more.

342
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,895
Shambhu! Uncle!

343
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:06,669
Help! Uncle!

344
00:47:07,204 --> 00:47:09,297
Anybody there?

345
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:02,122
lt would have been
better if l had died!

346
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,391
- God forbid!
- l should've died!

347
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:11,499
What's the point in such a life?

348
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:16,765
l will tolerate the harshest
sunlight in your shadow.

349
00:48:17,675 --> 00:48:19,643
For God's sake don't say that!

350
00:48:27,184 --> 00:48:28,481
Smoke mine father.

351
00:48:36,794 --> 00:48:40,890
Smoking? Kids don't smoke.

352
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:45,257
- You must not smoke.
- l'll never smoke Dad.

353
00:48:46,804 --> 00:48:48,271
Here you smoke.

354
00:48:49,573 --> 00:48:52,906
l'll roll joints for you.

355
00:48:53,444 --> 00:48:55,412
And you smoke. No problem.

356
00:48:55,946 --> 00:48:59,677
- Daughter-in-law!
- Wait. l'm coming.

357
00:49:00,317 --> 00:49:03,286
- Call your mother.
- Mother!

358
00:49:03,454 --> 00:49:05,422
Mother, l'll help you...

359
00:49:12,963 --> 00:49:14,692
Mother!

360
00:49:32,516 --> 00:49:33,608
Good God!

361
00:49:35,019 --> 00:49:38,477
Why are you giving the oxen
this dirty water to drink?

362
00:49:39,256 --> 00:49:41,486
Take the oxen to our well.

363
00:49:41,892 --> 00:49:44,622
No. Don't do this.

364
00:49:45,162 --> 00:49:48,393
Why not?

365
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:51,634
What will you do with them?

366
00:49:52,036 --> 00:49:53,503
You'll have to sell them.

367
00:49:54,405 --> 00:49:58,501
Was my money worthless...?

368
00:50:00,411 --> 00:50:02,641
You'll never be happy.

369
00:50:04,048 --> 00:50:06,642
Don't take curses from my kids.

370
00:50:07,184 --> 00:50:08,515
l have no arms.

371
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:13,782
No hands and no shame!

372
00:50:14,992 --> 00:50:18,587
Kids are starving and
you live off your wife!

373
00:50:18,962 --> 00:50:23,422
Shameless! Darken your face and
sit on the village outskirts.

374
00:50:24,101 --> 00:50:27,935
Live off charity like a stray dog!

375
00:50:28,205 --> 00:50:30,298
Take the oxen!

376
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:33,802
l won't let you take them! No!

377
00:50:37,114 --> 00:50:39,582
Tie a bell round my neck!

378
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:43,448
And turn me into an ox.
Oh! l forgot...

379
00:50:43,854 --> 00:50:45,583
Tie this in his neck.

380
00:51:09,346 --> 00:51:12,440
Give this too to the money lender.

381
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:57,155
You have no hands and no shame.

382
00:51:57,428 --> 00:52:02,388
The kids are starving and
you live off your wife!

383
00:52:05,569 --> 00:52:10,529
lf you must live, live on charity.

384
00:54:07,024 --> 00:54:08,855
Mother!

385
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:11,886
l knew it!

386
00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:16,622
- What did you know?
- l knew he wouldn't take it.

387
00:54:16,934 --> 00:54:19,664
l knew it! l knew it would happen!

388
00:54:20,037 --> 00:54:21,265
Daughter-in-law!

389
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,768
Your vermilion!

390
00:54:29,179 --> 00:54:31,647
No mother!

391
00:54:48,865 --> 00:54:50,093
Mother!

392
00:54:51,635 --> 00:54:52,465
Mother!

393
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:45,349
Mother what's wrong?
Didn't find Dad?

394
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:48,958
Where has Dad gone?

395
00:55:51,294 --> 00:55:53,023
He got angry with me and left.

396
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:56,399
Why? Got angry and left?

397
00:55:58,035 --> 00:56:01,129
But why are you crying?

398
00:56:02,305 --> 00:56:03,272
Shall l tell you something?

399
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:09,901
He has no hands.
Who will feed him?

400
00:56:10,814 --> 00:56:14,545
- That's why l'm crying.
- You're crying.

401
00:56:19,556 --> 00:56:21,649
Let's go home.

402
00:59:54,304 --> 00:59:57,398
Grandma! Grandma!

403
00:59:59,309 --> 01:00:02,904
Grandma! Get up!

404
01:00:03,179 --> 01:00:04,407
Get up grandma!

405
01:00:09,452 --> 01:00:12,182
Or l'll get water!

406
01:00:16,826 --> 01:00:19,158
Okay l'll get water!

407
01:00:19,596 --> 01:00:21,689
l'll throw water at you.

408
01:00:22,966 --> 01:00:26,060
- Let her be.
- l'll call mother.

409
01:00:27,704 --> 01:00:31,162
Mother, grandma is sleeping tight.

410
01:00:47,891 --> 01:00:50,359
Mother, you're feeding others
with sweets and starving us!

411
01:00:50,627 --> 01:00:55,587
Feed the dead and
starve the living to death!

412
01:00:56,032 --> 01:00:57,260
This is life.

413
01:00:59,402 --> 01:01:00,994
Open the door!

414
01:01:01,638 --> 01:01:03,469
Open the door!

415
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:09,100
Mother open the door!

416
01:01:28,765 --> 01:01:31,859
Dear Radha!

417
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:38,002
Shame on you! You took
20 acres of land, the oxen!

418
01:01:38,274 --> 01:01:39,741
Now have you come for the corpses?

419
01:01:40,543 --> 01:01:43,137
You have your eyes set
on the 5 acres that remain!

420
01:01:43,546 --> 01:01:46,777
You'll die a dog's death!

421
01:01:47,183 --> 01:01:51,279
Doesn't matter. Even the
dog is a creation of God.

422
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:54,020
- What do you want?
- Money.

423
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:57,787
- She has no money to give!
- l'm ready to look after them all.

424
01:01:58,595 --> 01:02:01,928
Try to understand me.

425
01:02:02,732 --> 01:02:06,828
Explain to her that her
husband ditched her and left.

426
01:02:07,504 --> 01:02:11,099
l'm still alive
l'll look after everything.

427
01:02:11,508 --> 01:02:16,844
Take back the land, the oxen.
And we'll see about the loan too.

428
01:02:19,015 --> 01:02:22,348
Mother, my ox has returned!

429
01:02:25,121 --> 01:02:27,089
Will you leave me and go?

430
01:02:27,257 --> 01:02:31,489
Now if you go, l won't
talk to you ever!

431
01:02:31,628 --> 01:02:33,960
l'll never speak to you!

432
01:02:34,264 --> 01:02:35,731
You won't go.

433
01:02:36,032 --> 01:02:41,800
l won't talk if you go.

434
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:47,172
Come here.

435
01:02:47,644 --> 01:02:52,604
- l won't.
- Son, take the ox out.

436
01:02:58,455 --> 01:03:04,553
Fine. Just as you have returned
the oxen, return the loan too.

437
01:03:05,061 --> 01:03:09,157
lf you don't like my deal,
forget it.

438
01:03:14,471 --> 01:03:20,307
Radha is not for sale.
She'll die but not sell herself.

439
01:03:23,346 --> 01:03:27,305
She can be sold only for her kids.

440
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:31,081
Take your share when
the crop is harvested.

441
01:03:31,354 --> 01:03:32,821
Now go away.

442
01:03:33,723 --> 01:03:35,315
l say go away.

443
01:07:48,778 --> 01:07:51,110
God! Now what will happen?

444
01:07:51,781 --> 01:07:55,740
The crop is almost ready. lf it
rains now, there'll be a famine.

445
01:08:14,036 --> 01:08:16,368
God! We don't want water!

446
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:30,018
Hold me!

447
01:08:31,387 --> 01:08:33,719
Help!

448
01:09:36,853 --> 01:09:40,687
Mother! A snake!

449
01:09:49,966 --> 01:09:53,925
Throw it Birju!

450
01:09:56,205 --> 01:09:59,072
Go away from my mother!

451
01:10:02,078 --> 01:10:03,306
Mother l'm very hungry.

452
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:06,412
- Give me some food.
- ln a minute.

453
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:08,914
l'll light a blazing fire.

454
01:10:13,089 --> 01:10:17,924
Mother, baby is not getting up.

455
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:36,667
Radha my queen.

456
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:41,939
You had called me over.
So l've come for my share.

457
01:10:42,218 --> 01:10:46,177
lf l wouldn't come now,
you'd say l didn't come.

458
01:10:49,358 --> 01:10:51,952
Lord! Killed him finally?

459
01:10:55,731 --> 01:11:00,065
Swear by God, l feel very sorry.

460
01:11:00,369 --> 01:11:02,505
Son will you have some grams?

461
01:11:02,505 --> 01:11:06,236
l won't have that.
l'll eat what mother is cooking.

462
01:11:11,914 --> 01:11:14,644
Mother, l'm starving.

463
01:11:15,051 --> 01:11:17,019
Very hungry.

464
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:22,882
There's nothing in this.

465
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:24,251
The food is cooked son.

466
01:11:24,794 --> 01:11:29,754
Lord! Why are you doing this?

467
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:35,259
What to do? l'm so soft
l can't bear to see this!

468
01:11:35,438 --> 01:11:36,405
Eat this son.

469
01:11:39,075 --> 01:11:42,806
Throw it away. Throw it!

470
01:11:43,579 --> 01:11:45,308
What kind of mother are you?

471
01:11:46,949 --> 01:11:49,952
Eat it son.

472
01:11:49,952 --> 01:11:51,783
ln that hand too.

473
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:59,650
Throw it. Throw it!

474
01:12:01,697 --> 01:12:05,531
Do you want me or the grams?

475
01:12:16,846 --> 01:12:19,110
Mother and son, just the same!

476
01:12:22,652 --> 01:12:24,620
By morning you'll come
to your senses.

477
01:12:27,156 --> 01:12:32,116
l'm a very patient man.

478
01:12:33,162 --> 01:12:38,122
When your anger cools down,
think over my proposal again.

479
01:12:46,842 --> 01:12:51,802
Son! Birju!

480
01:13:19,475 --> 01:13:21,943
Look at me!

481
01:13:22,478 --> 01:13:24,708
Nothing will happen to my son.

482
01:13:26,215 --> 01:13:28,809
Mother!

483
01:13:29,351 --> 01:13:31,683
Yes, l'll give you the grams.

484
01:13:44,734 --> 01:13:46,565
Hungry...grams...

485
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:02,217
l'll get them for you.

486
01:14:08,624 --> 01:14:13,584
Mother, hungry...grams...

487
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,838
Bless you lady.

488
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:26,137
Radha the queen at my step?

489
01:14:26,308 --> 01:14:31,041
l am blessed. Come in.

490
01:14:31,447 --> 01:14:34,041
Come in.

491
01:14:43,826 --> 01:14:45,157
My children are starving.

492
01:14:45,461 --> 01:14:50,421
Give me food.

493
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,658
Give me food. My kids are hungry.

494
01:14:54,837 --> 01:14:57,431
Understood.

495
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:07,944
l'll cover my queen in gold.

496
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:14,585
Don't worry my queen. Who holds the
generous man's hand will be happy.

497
01:15:15,691 --> 01:15:20,719
Even if l keep a dog,
it will wear a gold chain.

498
01:15:23,632 --> 01:15:27,864
Swear by God, you look
like the goddess of wealth.

499
01:15:29,138 --> 01:15:33,097
- Come.
- l'll look like a goddess?

500
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:38,606
Didn't you feel ashamed
to come in this form?

501
01:15:39,648 --> 01:15:43,607
lf you've come in my form,
keep your image intact.

502
01:15:44,286 --> 01:15:45,378
Don't laugh.

503
01:15:47,022 --> 01:15:52,358
The goddess who carries
the burden of the world.

504
01:15:53,028 --> 01:15:55,929
You won't be able to carry
the burden of motherhood.

505
01:15:57,099 --> 01:16:01,433
Try and become a mother.
You'll give up in 2 steps

506
01:16:02,605 --> 01:16:04,937
- She won't go from here.
- Don't you dare!

507
01:16:05,608 --> 01:16:07,439
- Let go of her.
- Don't touch it!

508
01:16:07,977 --> 01:16:12,937
She has given you wealth and
brought me here in poverty.

509
01:16:13,249 --> 01:16:17,709
l want to show her
it's easy to preach

510
01:16:17,987 --> 01:16:19,955
But very difficult to follow.

511
01:16:20,756 --> 01:16:23,359
lt's easy to watch the fun.

512
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:27,455
But very difficult to
lead life as in a play.

513
01:16:27,863 --> 01:16:29,455
Very difficult.

514
01:16:30,099 --> 01:16:36,334
See what a helpless mother
can do for her children!

515
01:16:37,606 --> 01:16:40,871
To what depths she can sink!

516
01:16:42,177 --> 01:16:45,510
She cannot give strength.

517
01:16:46,181 --> 01:16:49,514
Then take away my shame!

518
01:16:49,785 --> 01:16:54,745
l can't sacrifice my children!

519
01:17:13,309 --> 01:17:16,540
He will return. He is alive.

520
01:17:16,812 --> 01:17:19,144
This won't remain.

521
01:17:19,548 --> 01:17:24,508
A woman's duty is motherhood.

522
01:17:26,322 --> 01:17:28,654
Thank God you came to me.

523
01:17:29,191 --> 01:17:31,659
Otherwise your sweet kids
would die.

524
01:17:32,061 --> 01:17:33,790
- Come.
- Let go!

525
01:17:37,299 --> 01:17:42,760
The goddess has returned my husband
She will also return my children.

526
01:17:43,839 --> 01:17:47,172
- She will.
- Yes she will.

527
01:17:47,943 --> 01:17:52,903
She'll return your husband and kids.

528
01:17:53,215 --> 01:17:55,547
But at my hands!

529
01:18:17,206 --> 01:18:20,175
Help me!

530
01:18:53,509 --> 01:18:56,603
Won't you leave?
The entire village is going.

531
01:18:57,012 --> 01:19:00,243
- l won't go.
- You want to starve here?

532
01:19:01,016 --> 01:19:03,109
Nothing can be done in
this field for 2 years.

533
01:19:03,786 --> 01:19:07,017
l won't leave home.
What if my husband returns?

534
01:26:38,473 --> 01:26:42,466
You've changed the
face of the village

535
01:26:42,777 --> 01:26:47,737
Honestly l've neither seen
nor heard of such a crop!

536
01:26:47,883 --> 01:26:53,344
Feels as if the crop has
fallen from heaven not earth.

537
01:26:54,022 --> 01:26:58,159
Don't worry. Your share of
3 parts has been kept aside.

538
01:26:58,159 --> 01:26:59,490
Go and take it.

539
01:27:00,996 --> 01:27:03,328
- Yes master?
- Fill the carts.

540
01:27:09,771 --> 01:27:12,103
How are you my son?

541
01:27:12,507 --> 01:27:15,601
Get up son. This is my share.

542
01:27:16,411 --> 01:27:22,247
First show me the account.
Then look at my crop.

543
01:27:23,418 --> 01:27:28,014
So you want to see the account?

544
01:27:28,423 --> 01:27:33,383
Have l fallen on such times
that l have to show you accounts?

545
01:27:33,795 --> 01:27:38,129
Hear! He wants to see my books.

546
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:43,760
Your father never looked at
my books, what will you do?

547
01:27:44,439 --> 01:27:47,169
The son will see
the father's account

548
01:27:50,545 --> 01:27:52,012
Show him the account.

549
01:27:53,281 --> 01:27:54,612
Move away.

550
01:28:00,789 --> 01:28:03,519
What are you doing?
Aren't you ashamed?

551
01:28:03,925 --> 01:28:05,392
l've grown old filling your house!

552
01:28:05,927 --> 01:28:08,896
And for this grain, you're
aiming a gun at my son!

553
01:28:09,431 --> 01:28:12,025
10 such crops sacrificed
for my son!

554
01:28:12,667 --> 01:28:14,259
Take it away! We don't want it!

555
01:28:14,803 --> 01:28:18,637
Did l ask you to shoot?
Join an army if you want to shoot!

556
01:28:19,074 --> 01:28:22,805
Why do you need guns?
l asked to show the account.

557
01:28:23,311 --> 01:28:26,644
Take the grain. You don't do
the job you've come for! Shooting!

558
01:28:26,815 --> 01:28:28,544
What are you waiting for?

559
01:28:29,985 --> 01:28:34,217
l won't let him take one grain!

560
01:28:37,092 --> 01:28:38,821
We'll have to give it if it's due.

561
01:28:40,996 --> 01:28:43,965
- Take your share!
- Live long son.

562
01:28:44,499 --> 01:28:46,592
Don'tjust stare. Lift it!

563
01:28:54,609 --> 01:28:57,203
- Drop this!
- Mother!

564
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:00,610
l won't let him take the crop.

565
01:29:02,117 --> 01:29:05,086
We've plowed the land like oxen.

566
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:08,953
lt contains our sweat.
We stayed hungry for it

567
01:29:11,626 --> 01:29:14,094
lf this grain won't feed us,
l'll burn it up!

568
01:29:15,263 --> 01:29:20,223
Then ask him to show me the account.

569
01:29:20,635 --> 01:29:25,595
You want to see the books.
Here have a look.

570
01:29:28,276 --> 01:29:30,744
Here study it.

571
01:29:34,816 --> 01:29:37,284
Read it my son.

572
01:29:38,687 --> 01:29:40,245
You read it mother.

573
01:29:47,328 --> 01:29:50,058
Ask somebody else to read it.

574
01:29:53,468 --> 01:29:57,700
- You read it!
- Read it. Don't feel shy.

575
01:29:58,206 --> 01:30:00,975
He can't understand accounts.
You read and explain it to him.

576
01:30:00,975 --> 01:30:04,308
- You read it uncle.
- This is knowledge.

577
01:30:04,713 --> 01:30:08,444
lf we could read,
we wouldn't see this day.

578
01:30:08,583 --> 01:30:10,346
Then you signed it without reading?

579
01:30:10,885 --> 01:30:13,979
Your grandma signed it!

580
01:30:22,163 --> 01:30:24,495
Your cow has gone to a fieId.

581
01:30:24,799 --> 01:30:27,669
- He's dragging her away.
- What?

582
01:30:27,669 --> 01:30:31,400
Daughter come fast.
Take the class. l'm going out.

583
01:31:10,478 --> 01:31:11,706
What comes next?

584
01:31:12,347 --> 01:31:17,307
The pots of the village belles.
And your stones.

585
01:31:17,852 --> 01:31:20,548
Your rough tumble games.

586
01:31:23,224 --> 01:31:27,684
After 3 years you've come
to ask what comes next?

587
01:31:27,862 --> 01:31:30,956
- Where were you?
- Here only.

588
01:31:31,232 --> 01:31:35,191
l would hide behind the tamarind
tree and watch you everyday.

589
01:31:35,737 --> 01:31:37,068
Why?

590
01:31:37,605 --> 01:31:42,565
l'm not scared but l feel
somewhat in awe of you.

591
01:31:42,977 --> 01:31:44,945
Do l have horns on my head?

592
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:48,349
No, you are very nice.

593
01:31:50,118 --> 01:31:52,086
Better than all the village girls!

594
01:31:55,256 --> 01:32:00,216
You've read so many books and l...

595
01:32:00,995 --> 01:32:05,955
..know nothing beyond
half the alphabets

596
01:32:06,434 --> 01:32:10,393
- l feel shy of you.
- Aren't you feeling shy today?

597
01:32:11,206 --> 01:32:14,801
l feel ashamed today
but today Sukhi had come.

598
01:32:16,311 --> 01:32:21,271
By morning l want to read from
the alphabets to his books!

599
01:32:22,483 --> 01:32:24,508
You want to read his books?

600
01:32:24,686 --> 01:32:28,144
- The most difficult knowledge.
- There's no knowledge in it.

601
01:32:29,691 --> 01:32:32,159
There is! l saw it myself!

602
01:32:32,327 --> 01:32:34,921
And l showed it to everyone.
lt has the same letters!

603
01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:41,428
For 20 years we've given him 3 parts
of our crop to repay his loan of 500.

604
01:32:44,205 --> 01:32:46,537
He has even taken away
20 acres of our land.

605
01:32:48,209 --> 01:32:51,042
He removed the gold bangles

606
01:32:51,546 --> 01:32:53,138
She now wears only black thread.

607
01:32:54,048 --> 01:32:58,280
Yet his debt remains.

608
01:32:59,187 --> 01:33:01,018
lt's such a cruel knowledge!

609
01:33:01,823 --> 01:33:06,783
How can it be so cruel?
l want to understand this!

610
01:33:08,696 --> 01:33:09,924
You want to understand this?

611
01:33:13,468 --> 01:33:16,070
This is the 25 acres of land
your grandmother owned.

612
01:33:16,070 --> 01:33:17,537
She took 500 bucks as loan against it.

613
01:33:18,072 --> 01:33:21,667
The first crop was of 400.
You gave 3 parts as interest.

614
01:33:22,844 --> 01:33:25,438
And kept one part. Similarly
the second crop was of 400.

615
01:33:25,847 --> 01:33:29,078
Again you paid 300
as interest and ate 100.

616
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:32,251
ln 20 years you gave
this much of interest.

617
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,613
Then you gave the land as interest.

618
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:37,258
But the principal is as it is.

619
01:33:38,026 --> 01:33:39,493
This land is mine!

620
01:33:39,827 --> 01:33:43,422
lt is my mother.
Nobody can snatch it from me!

621
01:33:44,198 --> 01:33:47,656
This cycle has been going on
and will continue forever.

622
01:33:48,136 --> 01:33:51,401
l won't let it continue!
l have understood the account!

623
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:56,071
l'll tell mother and
the whole village!

624
01:33:59,414 --> 01:34:01,279
l'll take back our land!

625
01:34:02,216 --> 01:34:03,444
l'll take back everyone's land!

626
01:34:04,352 --> 01:34:07,810
He is a thief and l've caught him!

627
01:34:08,589 --> 01:34:10,318
l'll never spare him!

628
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:15,090
Beware! Don't you dare
speak nonsense about my Dad!

629
01:34:15,496 --> 01:34:19,091
You look after your Dad.

630
01:34:19,367 --> 01:34:21,096
l'll set him straight.

631
01:34:21,869 --> 01:34:22,597
Let's see!

632
01:34:24,739 --> 01:34:30,473
Don't mess with me. Go your way!

633
01:34:31,913 --> 01:34:33,505
Will you hold my hand?

634
01:34:34,315 --> 01:34:39,275
Your groom will go back

635
01:34:40,421 --> 01:34:43,515
Even if l'm imprisoned after that

636
01:34:43,992 --> 01:34:46,324
Get lost! You son-of-a gun!

637
01:34:46,627 --> 01:34:49,960
You need an army to do that!

638
01:34:50,631 --> 01:34:51,757
Then wait.

639
01:34:53,668 --> 01:34:55,636
Don't run away.

640
01:34:57,939 --> 01:35:00,669
Get lost son of a deserter!

641
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:09,775
Sister-in-law! Why did
you come in between?

642
01:35:09,951 --> 01:35:11,043
l'm not your sister-in-law!

643
01:35:11,419 --> 01:35:13,921
Then you'll become tomorrow.
Why are you crying?

644
01:35:13,921 --> 01:35:17,425
- You broke 10 of my pots.
- Shall l say something?

645
01:35:17,425 --> 01:35:20,394
- l'm not your sister-in-law!
- But listen!

646
01:35:21,796 --> 01:35:26,756
l've got your horoscope
matched with my brothers!

647
01:35:30,071 --> 01:35:33,905
Honestly! l promised to give
the priest 2 quintals ofjowar.

648
01:35:34,942 --> 01:35:36,273
- Really?
- Yes.

649
01:35:37,945 --> 01:35:39,276
You broke another pot!

650
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:43,013
Do you think l'm a potter?

651
01:35:45,453 --> 01:35:47,785
Why do you break pots?

652
01:35:48,089 --> 01:35:49,681
Give me my smoke.

653
01:35:49,957 --> 01:35:51,788
Your mother will scold!

654
01:35:52,693 --> 01:35:58,393
lf your mother sees, she'll
kill me. Give it back.

655
01:35:58,566 --> 01:36:04,027
Good Lord! l give up on you!

656
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:07,499
What are you doing here? Go.

657
01:36:10,311 --> 01:36:14,145
How many times have l
told you not to tease her!

658
01:36:14,449 --> 01:36:18,681
His sister's responsibility is
on me. She'll pull my hair out!

659
01:36:18,953 --> 01:36:24,414
lf l don't tease my brother's
wife, should l tease you?

660
01:36:24,826 --> 01:36:27,556
She's not your brother's wife!

661
01:36:30,965 --> 01:36:35,925
So often l've told you to
send her back to her village!

662
01:36:36,337 --> 01:36:38,805
- You did say.
- Ramu has seen her.

663
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:42,073
Everybody has accepted.
Now why is she still here?

664
01:36:42,610 --> 01:36:44,077
l didn't give it to him.

665
01:36:47,115 --> 01:36:48,844
Where are you going after a bath?

666
01:36:49,484 --> 01:36:50,751
Don't stand in my way.

667
01:36:50,751 --> 01:36:54,482
First say what happened.

668
01:36:55,022 --> 01:36:57,658
- Say something.
- l'm going to my village.

669
01:36:57,658 --> 01:36:59,387
- Why?
- Birju.

670
01:37:11,405 --> 01:37:12,872
What's the matter?

671
01:37:14,275 --> 01:37:15,367
What has he done?

672
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,636
What did he do?

673
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:20,909
Why are you scared? Tell me.

674
01:37:21,048 --> 01:37:22,140
He...

675
01:37:26,921 --> 01:37:28,388
l'm feeling shy.

676
01:37:28,689 --> 01:37:30,281
- Let go.
- First say...

677
01:37:30,791 --> 01:37:34,249
l can't tell you.

678
01:37:35,696 --> 01:37:36,788
Let go.

679
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:40,698
By my word...

680
01:37:49,977 --> 01:37:50,944
Really?

681
01:41:44,111 --> 01:41:45,305
Who is it?

682
01:41:46,247 --> 01:41:48,078
Get the gun.

683
01:41:49,383 --> 01:41:52,386
- Who is it?
- l've brought some cotton.

684
01:41:52,386 --> 01:41:55,122
- Hope it's not full of hay.
- Come and have a look.

685
01:41:55,122 --> 01:41:58,216
The deal is in the night
Who wants to have a look.

686
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:00,891
Deal for 50 bucks.

687
01:42:01,195 --> 01:42:05,154
lt's not stolen. The cotton is mine.

688
01:42:05,933 --> 01:42:09,391
l'll take a pair of gold bangles
lf you have them, we deal.

689
01:42:09,804 --> 01:42:11,897
- Or l'm off!
- Come here and listen.

690
01:42:14,708 --> 01:42:17,302
These gold bangles weigh 4.50 grams.

691
01:42:17,445 --> 01:42:18,673
And this is the cash.

692
01:42:20,214 --> 01:42:22,307
My mother will wear these!

693
01:42:25,719 --> 01:42:28,950
- Do they really weigh 4.50?
- Yes.

694
01:42:29,323 --> 01:42:32,554
We don't make crooked deals.
That's only at Sukhi's place.

695
01:42:32,726 --> 01:42:34,694
Now go.

696
01:42:36,230 --> 01:42:42,965
lf there's any cheating,
l'll shove this gun in your tummy!

697
01:42:43,204 --> 01:42:45,172
Go while it is still dark.

698
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:49,409
- Give my money.
- Money?

699
01:42:49,844 --> 01:42:52,074
Yes, 25 bucks!

700
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:58,544
What are you doing? Let me go!

701
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:01,051
Mother!

702
01:43:04,191 --> 01:43:05,920
Where have you been?

703
01:43:08,963 --> 01:43:10,931
Didn't tell anyone!

704
01:43:27,748 --> 01:43:29,943
Where have you been for 2 days?

705
01:43:30,084 --> 01:43:32,314
You went without telling me!
l'm very annoyed with you!

706
01:43:32,486 --> 01:43:36,946
l won't talk to you!
Why don't you say where you were!

707
01:43:37,224 --> 01:43:38,953
l was here only.

708
01:43:39,226 --> 01:43:40,818
Look at your face!

709
01:43:44,865 --> 01:43:50,826
l was watching God's miracle near
the riverside, under the tree.

710
01:43:56,110 --> 01:43:57,839
God's miracle?

711
01:43:58,012 --> 01:44:01,846
Yes mother. A great
saint has come there.

712
01:44:03,751 --> 01:44:05,582
With long locks.

713
01:44:11,759 --> 01:44:14,227
He had this long hair!

714
01:44:14,395 --> 01:44:15,896
And his meditation..

715
01:44:15,896 --> 01:44:20,856
He was sitting like this
on his head!

716
01:44:21,702 --> 01:44:23,294
What are you doing?

717
01:44:25,573 --> 01:44:28,906
- Like this mother.
- Straighten up.

718
01:44:29,710 --> 01:44:31,337
He was pleased with me.

719
01:44:32,146 --> 01:44:35,741
And said, child ask
for whatever you want.

720
01:44:36,650 --> 01:44:38,413
l said sire, l want nothing.

721
01:44:39,186 --> 01:44:44,783
lf you have to give, give me
2 gold bangles for my mother.

722
01:44:46,961 --> 01:44:50,556
l heard a voice, shut your eyes.

723
01:44:51,765 --> 01:44:52,857
You also close your eyes.

724
01:45:00,774 --> 01:45:03,106
Open your eyes mother.

725
01:45:04,144 --> 01:45:07,375
Why did you ask for gold?

726
01:45:07,514 --> 01:45:11,245
Why didn't you ask for your
Dad's address? When he'll come?

727
01:45:11,652 --> 01:45:14,021
Take me to him now.

728
01:45:14,021 --> 01:45:18,617
Actually l was going to ask him..

729
01:45:19,526 --> 01:45:24,486
Soon as l opened my eyes
l saw there was no saint.

730
01:45:24,798 --> 01:45:27,767
Nor the tree nor the river.

731
01:45:30,404 --> 01:45:33,498
Soon as he returns,
l'll take you to him.

732
01:45:34,174 --> 01:45:39,134
And you can ask him
whatever you want.

733
01:45:41,215 --> 01:45:44,048
They look so nice on you.

734
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:47,451
Mother!

735
01:45:52,493 --> 01:45:57,453
Birju brought gold bangles for me!

736
01:45:58,332 --> 01:45:59,799
By the grace of a saint.

737
01:46:00,234 --> 01:46:04,068
That's by the grace of
your Birju not a saint!

738
01:46:05,339 --> 01:46:05,566
So? You've started this too?

739
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:14,572
Where are you going?

740
01:46:15,049 --> 01:46:18,644
Started fighting as soon as you
entered! Let me know what it is!

741
01:46:19,153 --> 01:46:20,620
Your son is a thief!

742
01:46:21,422 --> 01:46:23,754
- Don't talk like this.
- Thief!

743
01:46:26,427 --> 01:46:27,655
Am l a thief?

744
01:46:27,795 --> 01:46:30,389
Who says my son is a thief?

745
01:46:30,931 --> 01:46:33,300
No, he's a big businessman.

746
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,894
He gets gold bangles for you!

747
01:46:36,303 --> 01:46:39,272
Refer to her as sister.

748
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:42,470
That's what l do consider her.

749
01:46:42,609 --> 01:46:46,568
For your sake, l didn't
file a complaint.

750
01:46:46,747 --> 01:46:51,081
l have two witnesses.
Your son stole my crop!

751
01:46:51,285 --> 01:46:52,877
Only then are you
wearing these bangles.

752
01:46:53,554 --> 01:46:59,015
Give my share of the money
or l'll ruin the entire house!

753
01:46:59,426 --> 01:47:01,519
Who cares? Write the complaint.

754
01:47:02,229 --> 01:47:04,322
lt was my crop so l took it.

755
01:47:05,232 --> 01:47:08,565
l'm not the thief, you are!

756
01:47:09,970 --> 01:47:13,098
Cheating my mother for 15 years!

757
01:47:13,273 --> 01:47:17,676
l'm a thief so was my father!
l'm a worthless man.

758
01:47:18,078 --> 01:47:23,311
When you have to go to jail,
you'll know what l mean!

759
01:47:23,717 --> 01:47:24,547
l'm going.

760
01:47:25,252 --> 01:47:27,584
- Don't say a word to him.
- Wait.

761
01:47:28,122 --> 01:47:31,956
Nothing will happen to you
l'll pay back every penny.

762
01:47:32,893 --> 01:47:36,488
Birju is mad.
Mother return the bangles.

763
01:47:36,897 --> 01:47:43,137
- Don't give the bangles.
- You lied to me! You steal!

764
01:47:43,137 --> 01:47:47,039
You lied to me!

765
01:47:47,441 --> 01:47:51,036
l don't want the bangles.
Let go of my hand.

766
01:47:51,445 --> 01:47:54,039
- Make him leave my hand.
- Let go!

767
01:47:54,214 --> 01:47:56,808
- Don't interfere.
- Let go!

768
01:47:59,253 --> 01:48:01,585
Let go of her!

769
01:48:02,022 --> 01:48:06,982
- She won't remove them.
- Let go of her!

770
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:08,391
-Wait son.
- She won't remove them.

771
01:48:09,963 --> 01:48:14,923
For my sake, let go of my hand.

772
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:33,549
Take this.

773
01:48:35,722 --> 01:48:37,690
This also belongs to your Pop!

774
01:48:41,161 --> 01:48:43,391
Give them to your daughter as dowry!

775
01:48:46,967 --> 01:48:50,061
lt's wealth! Gently.

776
01:48:50,604 --> 01:48:52,333
Use it to cremate yourself!

777
01:48:54,608 --> 01:48:55,836
Who does this is a fool!

778
01:52:44,971 --> 01:52:46,939
Where does this go?

779
01:52:55,482 --> 01:52:57,074
You're always in my way!

780
01:52:57,250 --> 01:53:00,845
Move or you'll fly with it.

781
01:53:03,857 --> 01:53:06,257
Watch how far it goes.

782
01:53:11,431 --> 01:53:13,023
Now it goes far.

783
01:53:14,167 --> 01:53:16,635
These bangles are my mother's.

784
01:53:17,070 --> 01:53:19,800
But now they are my father's!

785
01:53:20,307 --> 01:53:22,775
Your father took the bangles.

786
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:26,040
Tell him to keep them locked up.

787
01:53:26,313 --> 01:53:29,282
Or l'll take the bangles
along with something else too.

788
01:53:29,683 --> 01:53:32,277
Yes, take your relative!

789
01:53:50,137 --> 01:53:53,732
Explain to your son
or you'll regret it!

790
01:53:54,407 --> 01:53:56,238
At least tell me what's the matter.

791
01:53:59,279 --> 01:54:02,612
- Why don't you speak?
- You tell her. l feel like crying.

792
01:54:03,016 --> 01:54:05,985
- We were...
- Wait...

793
01:54:06,786 --> 01:54:13,123
We were bathing in the river
when he came and started teasing us.

794
01:54:14,161 --> 01:54:17,494
- But what has he done?
- Sometimes he hits stones.

795
01:54:17,797 --> 01:54:21,535
- Sometimes he breaks pots.
- He's broken 3 of mine!

796
01:54:21,535 --> 01:54:24,629
- 4 of mine.
- 5 of mine!

797
01:54:24,938 --> 01:54:29,034
- 6 of mine.
- And never breaks mine!

798
01:54:29,109 --> 01:54:31,577
Let him come!
l'll break his head!

799
01:54:31,745 --> 01:54:33,975
- Where's my stick?
- Here, mother.

800
01:54:34,247 --> 01:54:35,976
Smash his head in!

801
01:54:36,917 --> 01:54:38,646
l'll really break his head!

802
01:54:44,157 --> 01:54:47,490
Teasing the viIIage girIs!
His sisters!

803
01:54:48,295 --> 01:54:52,891
And listen, if you've done
anything, l'll break your head too!

804
01:54:55,468 --> 01:54:58,266
God! Where have l
landed between women!

805
01:54:58,672 --> 01:55:00,503
Sorry ladies, l'm off.

806
01:55:01,074 --> 01:55:03,542
Come here!

807
01:55:14,821 --> 01:55:18,052
Mother, what's all this?

808
01:55:18,625 --> 01:55:20,718
You tease girls?

809
01:55:21,127 --> 01:55:22,856
l tease girls?

810
01:55:24,130 --> 01:55:27,463
- No, mother.
- Did you go to the river?

811
01:55:28,935 --> 01:55:32,166
River? But l'm here.

812
01:55:33,073 --> 01:55:34,802
Who says so?

813
01:55:37,077 --> 01:55:41,411
- l say so.
- When did l tease you?

814
01:55:41,948 --> 01:55:46,976
- With a snake.
- She says, with a snake!

815
01:55:48,255 --> 01:55:51,486
Can anybody catch a snake?

816
01:55:52,392 --> 01:55:53,984
Says, l scared her with a snake!

817
01:55:54,261 --> 01:55:57,094
You may have!
You may have caught a snake!

818
01:55:57,330 --> 01:55:59,423
You caught snakes even
when you were little!

819
01:55:59,566 --> 01:56:01,397
Why do you carry your shoes?

820
01:56:01,568 --> 01:56:06,528
- Put them on your feet.
- They hurt my feet.

821
01:56:06,706 --> 01:56:11,666
- Look here...
- No mother.

822
01:56:11,845 --> 01:56:15,178
You heard her. Now listen to me!

823
01:56:15,582 --> 01:56:17,914
- No!
- You have to listen!

824
01:56:18,084 --> 01:56:22,544
No! l won't listen to you!

825
01:56:22,956 --> 01:56:24,287
Okay! Speak up!

826
01:56:25,225 --> 01:56:27,489
l didn't tease her.

827
01:56:27,761 --> 01:56:29,228
lnstead she teases me.

828
01:56:37,671 --> 01:56:40,265
ln front of mother say who
teased whom? l teased or you did?

829
01:56:40,407 --> 01:56:42,375
You did! You!

830
01:56:44,477 --> 01:56:46,308
We teased you!

831
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:52,540
Now do you believe?
l didn't tease them.

832
01:56:54,587 --> 01:56:57,420
Snake!

833
01:57:01,294 --> 01:57:04,024
Move away!

834
01:57:18,912 --> 01:57:20,243
Put it in the plate.

835
01:57:23,516 --> 01:57:24,346
Take it.

836
01:57:34,627 --> 01:57:37,095
What delicious food we've cooked!

837
01:57:37,263 --> 01:57:42,997
Tell him l don't want
to talk to him

838
01:57:45,138 --> 01:57:47,470
l won't eat food! Tell him!

839
01:57:49,409 --> 01:57:52,378
Even if you get 4 daughters-in-law
food won't be as tasty!

840
01:57:52,645 --> 01:57:54,613
Just taste it.

841
01:57:54,914 --> 01:57:57,246
Ask him to let go of my hand!

842
01:57:57,550 --> 01:57:59,518
And l won't eat food!

843
01:58:00,186 --> 01:58:05,317
Okay, l won't tease anyone!

844
01:58:06,993 --> 01:58:08,221
l apologise on his behalf.

845
01:58:12,632 --> 01:58:14,361
- Really mother...
- Enough!

846
01:58:14,868 --> 01:58:19,828
Taking his side! l know
all about your antics too!

847
01:58:20,173 --> 01:58:23,506
Goes to meet Champa on the quiet!

848
01:58:24,444 --> 01:58:27,580
Says, my cow is sick!

849
01:58:27,580 --> 01:58:29,673
Talks to her before marriage!

850
01:58:29,816 --> 01:58:32,284
l'll send her to her
village tomorrow!

851
01:58:32,585 --> 01:58:35,989
Not fair. Taking his
temper out on me!

852
01:58:35,989 --> 01:58:41,450
Brother is very smart. Takes her
to the tamarind tree to eat it.

853
01:58:41,895 --> 01:58:45,228
Tell him to leave me.
l'm not talking to him.

854
01:58:45,498 --> 01:58:48,831
Leave her and bend over!

855
01:58:50,703 --> 01:58:53,433
Unless you do that mother will
not forgive you or eat dinner!

856
01:59:02,081 --> 01:59:06,040
The poor thing has bent over.
Now eat dinner.

857
01:59:06,619 --> 01:59:07,711
l won't eat.

858
01:59:09,889 --> 01:59:12,858
Then don't eat.
l will as l'm hungry.

859
01:59:13,026 --> 01:59:16,529
You punish him and feel hungry!

860
01:59:16,529 --> 01:59:18,997
You also bend over.

861
01:59:21,935 --> 01:59:25,666
Both of you trouble me a lot!
Nobody cares about me!

862
01:59:27,540 --> 01:59:30,910
Mother if you don't eat...

863
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:35,870
We'II remain Iike this
aII our Iives!

864
01:59:37,283 --> 01:59:40,047
Okay straighten up.
l'll eat only now.

865
01:59:40,854 --> 01:59:42,446
She's eating.

866
01:59:44,591 --> 01:59:46,923
Here mother.

867
01:59:51,231 --> 01:59:56,191
Tell him the fight isn't over.

868
01:59:56,669 --> 01:59:58,899
The fight will continue.

869
02:00:03,776 --> 02:00:07,234
l didn't say anything
in front of the girls.

870
02:00:07,547 --> 02:00:09,276
But listen carefully...

871
02:00:09,582 --> 02:00:12,176
l can forgive anything..

872
02:00:13,086 --> 02:00:15,418
But l'll never forgive it...

873
02:00:15,722 --> 02:00:18,316
..if you dishonour any girl!

874
02:00:18,591 --> 02:00:21,685
l'll kill you right there!
l hate these things!

875
02:00:23,396 --> 02:00:26,126
l'll fix your marriages
in the morning

876
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:28,993
Don't go to the wrong place.

877
02:00:29,802 --> 02:00:32,134
l know everything. Go to sleep!

878
02:01:08,908 --> 02:01:10,637
What's wrong?

879
02:02:12,805 --> 02:02:16,943
Get up! Champa hung herself!

880
02:02:16,943 --> 02:02:20,446
l swear l did nothing!

881
02:02:20,446 --> 02:02:26,043
What have you done?
l fed you well everyday!

882
02:02:26,452 --> 02:02:31,412
l even fixed your marriage.
The groom also agreed.

883
02:02:32,091 --> 02:02:37,825
lf you didn't approve of him, you
should've told me. l'd find another.

884
02:02:37,964 --> 02:02:40,933
l would've married you off.

885
02:02:41,834 --> 02:02:44,302
What have you done?

886
02:02:44,604 --> 02:02:47,198
What have you done?

887
02:02:52,445 --> 02:02:56,404
l haven't come to drink
cold drink made by her.

888
02:02:56,582 --> 02:02:58,914
l've come to take her home.

889
02:02:59,352 --> 02:03:03,448
When you come to my house,
l'll get her to make you a drink.

890
02:03:03,589 --> 02:03:06,820
Even l wanted this.

891
02:03:07,226 --> 02:03:12,186
You know she lost her parents
and everything in the flood.

892
02:03:12,899 --> 02:03:17,859
l brought her here.
l like your son a lot.

893
02:03:18,171 --> 02:03:22,767
But l heard you're getting
him married to Shambhu's niece...

894
02:03:23,276 --> 02:03:26,734
No, Champa is for Ramu.

895
02:03:26,979 --> 02:03:30,073
l want her for Birju.

896
02:03:30,349 --> 02:03:35,309
There's no boy like him
in our village!

897
02:03:35,588 --> 02:03:38,921
He's a little mischievous.
But then he's so young.

898
02:03:39,358 --> 02:03:41,485
The moment he gets married,
he'll forget mischief.

899
02:03:41,661 --> 02:03:43,629
He has many vices too.

900
02:03:44,163 --> 02:03:46,631
Cards throughout the day.
Gambles through the night.

901
02:03:46,899 --> 02:03:52,633
Don't name me, but l've heard
Sukhi wants to send him to jail.

902
02:03:53,072 --> 02:03:56,132
He even teases his daughter.

903
02:03:57,443 --> 02:04:00,037
Yes, you talk in the
villager's tone!

904
02:04:00,313 --> 02:04:02,645
My son is bad! Only he is wrong!

905
02:04:02,815 --> 02:04:07,775
l came to discuss his marriage.

906
02:04:08,087 --> 02:04:10,055
You malign him before me!

907
02:04:19,232 --> 02:04:20,460
Don't look at me so!

908
02:04:20,600 --> 02:04:22,693
l won't but answer me
what have l done to you?

909
02:04:22,835 --> 02:04:25,929
You never tease us.
We always tease you.

910
02:04:26,839 --> 02:04:28,807
Who says you trouble us?

911
02:04:36,349 --> 02:04:41,309
The teacherjust said he won't
marry Chandra to Birju.

912
02:04:43,256 --> 02:04:45,087
You marry Chandra?

913
02:04:47,627 --> 02:04:49,458
Did your mother go to talk?

914
02:04:50,997 --> 02:04:52,464
And he refused outright?

915
02:04:56,369 --> 02:04:58,337
That's very good!
l'm very happy!

916
02:04:58,671 --> 02:05:01,139
May you never get married!
To nobody!

917
02:05:11,184 --> 02:05:13,277
Nobody teases you!

918
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:16,288
You are bad! Very bad!

919
02:05:16,455 --> 02:05:21,415
l lost face thanks to you!

920
02:05:21,627 --> 02:05:23,896
l'll never get you married!

921
02:05:23,896 --> 02:05:27,229
l'll get Ramu married.
l'll play with his kids!

922
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:31,231
You look at him and feel jealous!

923
02:05:43,115 --> 02:05:45,583
l'd sent mother for your hand.

924
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:55,256
Thought if we get married,
l would become very good.

925
02:05:57,763 --> 02:05:59,594
Now l won't get married!

926
02:06:00,633 --> 02:06:02,362
l won't even become good.

927
02:06:03,502 --> 02:06:05,732
You are already married.

928
02:06:06,272 --> 02:06:08,604
You're married to your land.

929
02:06:09,542 --> 02:06:10,941
She's your bride.

930
02:06:11,944 --> 02:06:14,777
The money lender has
forcibly taken her away.

931
02:06:15,081 --> 02:06:17,049
Won't you release her?

932
02:06:17,850 --> 02:06:21,308
l will! l will!

933
02:06:23,356 --> 02:06:25,085
Good l didn't marry you.

934
02:06:26,225 --> 02:06:30,059
Now l don't care if l live or die!

935
02:06:31,964 --> 02:06:36,924
Mother's dreams will come true
with brother's marriage.

936
02:06:40,039 --> 02:06:43,372
Will you come for his wedding?

937
02:10:59,665 --> 02:11:03,761
l saw you so many times.

938
02:11:04,436 --> 02:11:05,903
And taIked to you.

939
02:11:07,439 --> 02:11:10,169
But today you seem absolutely new.

940
02:11:12,545 --> 02:11:14,012
Throw this away!

941
02:11:26,559 --> 02:11:28,288
Let go! Mother might see!

942
02:11:28,427 --> 02:11:29,655
l'm off to the field.
Bring lunch soon.

943
02:11:29,929 --> 02:11:31,797
- lf mother doesn't send me?
- l'll tell her.

944
02:11:31,797 --> 02:11:35,255
No! Don't. Let go.

945
02:11:42,308 --> 02:11:44,276
- Which one shall l hit?
- This one.

946
02:11:47,580 --> 02:11:49,810
- Oh no!
- Didn't touch!

947
02:12:00,459 --> 02:12:03,189
Leave it!

948
02:12:03,596 --> 02:12:05,325
Or l'll tell your brother you gamble!

949
02:12:15,241 --> 02:12:17,209
Bring it fast. What's for Iunch?

950
02:12:23,015 --> 02:12:26,348
- What's this?
- Birju ate it.

951
02:12:34,593 --> 02:12:35,821
He is gambling.

952
02:12:37,229 --> 02:12:38,457
Where is he?

953
02:12:46,739 --> 02:12:49,469
Run! Brother has come!

954
02:12:50,242 --> 02:12:51,072
l'll kill you!

955
02:12:56,582 --> 02:12:58,641
- Food!
- First go and wash up.

956
02:12:59,218 --> 02:13:00,947
l have washed up.
Now serve me dinner.

957
02:13:02,855 --> 02:13:04,686
Doesn't look like it.

958
02:13:05,591 --> 02:13:09,049
- Where's your brother?
- How do l know?

959
02:13:09,728 --> 02:13:11,457
Must be feeding grass
to the asses.

960
02:13:11,597 --> 02:13:15,055
Then why are you asking for food?
Your stomach must be full.

961
02:13:15,367 --> 02:13:17,597
Don't pull my leg!

962
02:13:20,372 --> 02:13:24,468
Brother, hope a cat didn't
cross your path today.

963
02:13:26,745 --> 02:13:29,077
Is this bread? Feed it to the cow!

964
02:13:29,982 --> 02:13:35,386
lf you don't like the way l cook,
get a cook from the money lender.

965
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:52,204
- What's the matter?
- Birju slapped me.

966
02:13:52,204 --> 02:13:55,435
He slapped you?
You slap me twice.

967
02:13:58,444 --> 02:14:03,404
l told you so many times,
don't lift weights now.

968
02:14:07,052 --> 02:14:10,886
Daughter-in-law!

969
02:14:18,564 --> 02:14:21,055
Are you going to
fill water? Am l dead?

970
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:24,469
Quiet! The baby is about to come
and there's no water at home.

971
02:14:24,870 --> 02:14:27,202
You stay with sister-in-law.
l'll get the water.

972
02:14:27,740 --> 02:14:28,640
Will you go to the well?

973
02:14:28,640 --> 02:14:30,642
- So what?
- What will the girls say?

974
02:14:30,642 --> 02:14:32,872
- What?
- Won't you feel ashamed? Leave it.

975
02:15:36,074 --> 02:15:38,907
- Mother, is it a girl or boy?
- A son!

976
02:15:39,945 --> 02:15:43,176
- Give him to me!
- He'll fall!

977
02:15:44,316 --> 02:15:47,046
Ramu's father. l've become a grandma

978
02:15:55,828 --> 02:15:58,058
Won't you come to see your grandson?

979
02:16:05,337 --> 02:16:08,431
Listen, where are you taking him?

980
02:16:09,975 --> 02:16:11,442
You'll drop him!

981
02:16:15,347 --> 02:16:16,575
Whose baby is this?

982
02:16:17,483 --> 02:16:21,715
Keep the eviI eye away. My baby!

983
02:16:21,987 --> 02:16:25,320
Grandma's pet! Whose prince?

984
02:22:22,681 --> 02:22:27,641
Leave her alone!

985
02:22:35,927 --> 02:22:39,385
What's the matter?

986
02:23:00,151 --> 02:23:02,483
- Throw the stick!
- Move out mother!

987
02:23:02,654 --> 02:23:05,623
What has my son done?

988
02:23:05,790 --> 02:23:07,121
He tried to malign a girl.

989
02:23:08,159 --> 02:23:10,795
You tried to malign
a girl from our village?

990
02:23:10,795 --> 02:23:11,625
l had warned you!

991
02:23:11,930 --> 02:23:16,890
- l won't accept this!
- But listne to me...

992
02:23:25,977 --> 02:23:28,810
Mother listen to him.

993
02:23:29,114 --> 02:23:31,344
- l'll kill him!
- Mother!

994
02:23:31,883 --> 02:23:35,487
He didn't do it for nothing.
This girl is no less!

995
02:23:35,487 --> 02:23:37,079
She is a real sly one!

996
02:23:37,255 --> 02:23:42,215
Ask the village girls
if you don't trust me.

997
02:23:43,495 --> 02:23:47,226
The day l got married, Birju
wanted to make her his sister.

998
02:23:47,499 --> 02:23:49,467
Ask why she didn't accept his gift

999
02:23:50,001 --> 02:23:53,095
- Who wants a torn scarf?
- Shut up!

1000
02:23:53,271 --> 02:23:54,238
Have you heard that?

1001
02:23:54,806 --> 02:23:58,765
Even today he kept teIIing her
not to throw coIour on him.

1002
02:23:58,944 --> 02:24:00,946
But she kept doing it.

1003
02:24:00,946 --> 02:24:04,404
She kept clanging her bangles
and getting him mad.

1004
02:24:05,083 --> 02:24:08,678
Youi are not aware, mentally she
harbours bad intentions for Birju.

1005
02:24:09,087 --> 02:24:12,318
But l ask which girl
hasn't Birju troubled?

1006
02:24:13,091 --> 02:24:15,821
Which girl's pot wasn't
broken by him?

1007
02:24:16,394 --> 02:24:19,764
Do your daughters also harbour
bad intentions for him?

1008
02:24:19,764 --> 02:24:24,724
Swear by God, l never saw anyone
in this village eyeing anybody else.

1009
02:24:24,903 --> 02:24:28,236
Don't make me open my mouth.
lt is not Birju's fault.

1010
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:30,471
Your sins are appearing before you!

1011
02:24:30,909 --> 02:24:32,777
Stop your wife Shambhu!

1012
02:24:32,777 --> 02:24:34,369
Arguing with men!

1013
02:24:34,646 --> 02:24:38,878
Finish the fight. First
you'll gave him intoxicants.

1014
02:24:39,451 --> 02:24:41,783
Then the whole village attacked him!

1015
02:24:42,220 --> 02:24:43,812
Get up!

1016
02:24:44,522 --> 02:24:50,256
- Apologise to the money lender.
- Yes apologise to him.

1017
02:24:53,098 --> 02:24:55,225
l'll wring one neck.

1018
02:24:57,535 --> 02:25:02,495
Nobody can wear my mother's bangles.

1019
02:25:03,541 --> 02:25:06,374
Return them to me.

1020
02:25:07,545 --> 02:25:09,877
Or l'll take your daughter
along with the bangles!

1021
02:25:10,181 --> 02:25:15,141
You have a great dream of
getting bangles for your mothre.

1022
02:25:15,553 --> 02:25:18,283
Tell me. l'll put
bangles on her wirsts.

1023
02:25:32,804 --> 02:25:35,540
What atrocity is this?

1024
02:25:35,540 --> 02:25:39,135
Now he can't stay in this village!

1025
02:25:39,411 --> 02:25:41,743
- No way!
- l beg you!

1026
02:25:42,047 --> 02:25:44,641
Villagers! You tell me
can he stay in our village?

1027
02:25:45,050 --> 02:25:46,779
No, he can't!

1028
02:25:46,985 --> 02:25:49,453
- l beg you!
- My life is in danger.

1029
02:25:49,721 --> 02:25:51,814
What are you watching?
Throw him out of hte village.

1030
02:25:52,123 --> 02:25:54,956
- lt's too much!
- No!

1031
02:26:08,239 --> 02:26:09,968
Don't throw him out!

1032
02:26:10,241 --> 02:26:13,878
l beg you! Don't!

1033
02:26:13,878 --> 02:26:16,247
You've beatne him up.
Been so cruel to him!

1034
02:26:16,247 --> 02:26:20,183
Forgive him once because
l'm asking you to!

1035
02:26:22,253 --> 02:26:25,086
He's no longer in your hands.

1036
02:26:25,256 --> 02:26:27,087
Don't accept responsibility for him.

1037
02:26:27,258 --> 02:26:29,726
He'll ruin the entire family's name.

1038
02:26:29,861 --> 02:26:32,091
- You'll lose your name too!
- No!

1039
02:26:32,363 --> 02:26:35,093
Now he won't do anything.

1040
02:26:35,500 --> 02:26:38,230
He won't raise his eyes
and look at anyone.

1041
02:26:38,770 --> 02:26:42,729
If he teases any girI...
I'II kiII him!

1042
02:26:43,775 --> 02:26:47,370
l promise all of you
now he won't do anything.

1043
02:26:47,645 --> 02:26:50,239
l beg you, forgive him once!

1044
02:26:50,515 --> 02:26:54,349
Forgive him just this once.
He won't do anything now.

1045
02:27:04,829 --> 02:27:08,162
l'll break you bones
if you step out of the house!

1046
02:27:10,101 --> 02:27:13,559
How dare you take the bangles
without taking my permission?

1047
02:27:14,439 --> 02:27:16,907
- Because l like them!
- Quiet!

1048
02:27:17,609 --> 02:27:22,444
Ask her in-laws when
they'll come for the marriage?

1049
02:27:22,614 --> 02:27:24,707
Say l'm in a hurry. Go!

1050
02:27:25,116 --> 02:27:29,075
l'm very young...

1051
02:27:29,354 --> 02:27:32,812
Shoot me.

1052
02:28:52,937 --> 02:28:56,771
What have you hidden?

1053
02:28:58,309 --> 02:29:01,745
Nothing. Nothing at all.

1054
02:29:02,547 --> 02:29:04,014
Show it to me.

1055
02:29:06,317 --> 02:29:07,545
You want to see it?

1056
02:29:12,924 --> 02:29:15,518
This is a gun. l've stolen it!

1057
02:29:16,561 --> 02:29:18,119
l'll kill hte money lender!

1058
02:29:20,565 --> 02:29:26,026
- What will happen to you then?
- l'm not worried.

1059
02:29:26,804 --> 02:29:31,764
l don't care about being hanged!
Or his men breaking my bones!

1060
02:29:32,076 --> 02:29:33,668
Let them shoot at me if they want!

1061
02:29:34,078 --> 02:29:36,911
l'll be happy if they empty
their rifles in my chest!

1062
02:29:38,583 --> 02:29:41,108
But l'll kill Sukhi!

1063
02:29:41,386 --> 02:29:45,720
No my child, throw this gun away!

1064
02:29:48,159 --> 02:29:50,923
l've been through great
difficulties to rear you.

1065
02:29:51,329 --> 02:29:54,560
You don't know that.

1066
02:29:55,833 --> 02:29:58,802
l've been through tough times
to make you a strapping youth.

1067
02:30:00,471 --> 02:30:03,440
You are not at all worried
about your mother!

1068
02:30:03,641 --> 02:30:05,871
How will l live without you?

1069
02:30:06,778 --> 02:30:09,246
l can't live without you my son!

1070
02:30:11,649 --> 02:30:13,981
You talk of making me happy.

1071
02:30:14,285 --> 02:30:16,378
Then throw this gun.

1072
02:30:16,654 --> 02:30:18,485
You want to create one
more problem for me!

1073
02:30:18,656 --> 02:30:20,988
Mother, this will never end.

1074
02:30:21,159 --> 02:30:22,990
Till Sukhi doesn't die!

1075
02:30:23,795 --> 02:30:27,026
l'm not scared of dying.
So what if a Birju dies?

1076
02:30:28,166 --> 02:30:31,294
My dying will bring back the
ornaments of the women in the village.

1077
02:30:31,469 --> 02:30:34,063
Grain will come to their homes!
They can start cooking food.

1078
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:38,365
His evil rule will end!
Let your son die!

1079
02:30:38,876 --> 02:30:43,472
By my death, the whole village
will have a better life.

1080
02:30:43,648 --> 02:30:46,742
But that won't solve anything.

1081
02:30:47,018 --> 02:30:50,112
Guns never help.

1082
02:30:51,289 --> 02:30:56,750
With a gun you can't
cover the women's head.

1083
02:30:58,329 --> 02:31:02,595
Grain won't come to
their homes at gun point.

1084
02:31:03,401 --> 02:31:06,859
Neither will it light their stoves.

1085
02:31:08,906 --> 02:31:10,237
Look at me.

1086
02:31:13,544 --> 02:31:19,881
With only 5 acres of land,
l have reared you and Ramu.

1087
02:31:21,819 --> 02:31:25,277
Then we didn't even have food.

1088
02:31:26,224 --> 02:31:30,558
l was alone. Today we are three.

1089
02:31:31,596 --> 02:31:33,063
We have food.

1090
02:31:33,731 --> 02:31:36,825
We have a plow, oxen.

1091
02:31:38,970 --> 02:31:40,437
Don't lose hope son.

1092
02:31:40,872 --> 02:31:44,467
We'll work hard, slog.

1093
02:31:45,376 --> 02:31:50,336
And God will change our fate.

1094
02:31:50,982 --> 02:31:52,950
All the village will change.

1095
02:31:53,885 --> 02:31:58,845
- Let go mother!
- No Birju!

1096
02:31:58,990 --> 02:32:03,222
No! Son!

1097
02:32:05,129 --> 02:32:07,859
Release me!

1098
02:32:10,568 --> 02:32:13,298
Take the gun away! He's stolen it!

1099
02:32:13,438 --> 02:32:15,269
Let go!

1100
02:32:41,933 --> 02:32:47,530
- Leave it.
- Leave it son.

1101
02:32:56,214 --> 02:32:58,182
Mother, break the gun.

1102
02:34:13,824 --> 02:34:15,553
Mother!

1103
02:34:21,599 --> 02:34:23,931
Don't go my son!

1104
02:34:24,468 --> 02:34:27,801
- Let me go.
- Son!

1105
02:34:30,741 --> 02:34:34,472
- Don't go son.
- l'm not your son nor you my mother!

1106
02:34:44,989 --> 02:34:49,949
Don't go my child.

1107
02:34:55,266 --> 02:34:56,995
Daughter-in-law!

1108
02:35:10,681 --> 02:35:13,775
Thief!

1109
02:35:48,252 --> 02:35:52,712
lt's him! Him!

1110
02:36:13,844 --> 02:36:15,311
l brought the bangles.

1111
02:36:15,579 --> 02:36:18,047
No my son.

1112
02:36:39,003 --> 02:36:40,834
- Let go of my hand!
- Master!

1113
02:36:41,138 --> 02:36:42,969
Her hands are fuII of bIood.

1114
02:36:43,607 --> 02:36:45,074
She must have hidden him somewhere.

1115
02:36:47,011 --> 02:36:50,845
She sent her son to kill me!

1116
02:36:57,288 --> 02:36:59,756
- Good God!
- Crush them!

1117
02:36:59,890 --> 02:37:02,358
- Not one step forward!
- Why are you scared?

1118
02:37:02,793 --> 02:37:05,125
Burn the hay stacks.
Smoke him out!

1119
02:38:14,465 --> 02:38:16,433
Mother!

1120
02:38:20,237 --> 02:38:22,205
Move aside!

1121
02:39:08,953 --> 02:39:11,683
Catch him! Don't let him escape!

1122
02:43:45,596 --> 02:43:48,224
Sister Radha!

1123
02:43:48,799 --> 02:43:51,131
Call her mother, not sister.

1124
02:43:51,401 --> 02:43:55,132
Mother! My mother!

1125
02:43:55,672 --> 02:44:01,269
- Birju is coming!
- Where is he?

1126
02:44:03,180 --> 02:44:05,910
Where is my son?

1127
02:44:06,683 --> 02:44:09,151
He has sent this letter.

1128
02:44:09,319 --> 02:44:12,777
He's coming to carry my daughter
away from her wedding platform!

1129
02:44:12,923 --> 02:44:17,883
The groom is at the door.
Nobody but you can stop him.

1130
02:44:18,929 --> 02:44:22,262
l beg you for my honour.

1131
02:44:22,699 --> 02:44:26,436
Forgive me! l beseech you!

1132
02:44:26,436 --> 02:44:29,894
- l plead with you!
- l forgive you.

1133
02:44:31,708 --> 02:44:33,210
You're forgiving him!

1134
02:44:33,210 --> 02:44:35,940
He's our enemy!
What Birju is doing is right!

1135
02:44:38,515 --> 02:44:42,611
She's not only his daughter,
but the daughter of the village.

1136
02:44:43,654 --> 02:44:44,985
She's my honour.

1137
02:44:45,656 --> 02:44:48,386
Your honour. The village's honour.

1138
02:44:52,563 --> 02:44:57,023
Go ahead with the wedding.
l take responsibility.

1139
02:44:57,568 --> 02:45:01,902
My son won't do anything.

1140
02:45:02,973 --> 02:45:05,305
Get my walking stick.

1141
02:45:38,141 --> 02:45:39,733
Mother!

1142
02:45:49,653 --> 02:45:53,384
Where had you gone?
Why are you dressed like this?

1143
02:45:53,924 --> 02:45:54,754
Climb down.

1144
02:45:55,659 --> 02:46:00,619
l'll never let you
leave home again.

1145
02:46:04,935 --> 02:46:07,671
Don't go my son!

1146
02:46:07,671 --> 02:46:10,640
They will kill you!

1147
02:46:13,543 --> 02:46:14,942
For my sake, don't go!

1148
02:46:15,245 --> 02:46:19,079
- Move out!
- Don't go!

1149
02:47:01,725 --> 02:47:04,319
Come son. You're right in time.

1150
02:47:04,594 --> 02:47:07,998
l've been pining to see you.

1151
02:47:07,998 --> 02:47:09,329
Give me my mother's bangles.

1152
02:47:09,499 --> 02:47:12,332
l've kept them carefully.

1153
02:47:12,736 --> 02:47:15,466
Stay here. l'll get the key.

1154
02:47:16,506 --> 02:47:19,964
What are you doing son?
l'm going to get the key.

1155
02:47:23,113 --> 02:47:25,581
What are you doing son?
l've grown old.

1156
02:47:30,520 --> 02:47:34,251
You're still as naughty
as you were in childhood.

1157
02:47:35,525 --> 02:47:38,756
As naughty as then.

1158
02:47:48,405 --> 02:47:51,306
Sit down brother.
You must be tired.

1159
02:48:01,218 --> 02:48:05,314
Have you forgotten
you ran away with my umbrella?

1160
02:48:05,722 --> 02:48:08,316
l ran behind you yelling,
give it back!

1161
02:48:19,636 --> 02:48:21,729
See, they are as shiny as before.

1162
02:48:31,581 --> 02:48:34,175
All the accounts will get mixed up.

1163
02:48:34,451 --> 02:48:36,544
Entries will get mixed up.

1164
02:48:37,587 --> 02:48:40,055
No! Son, no!

1165
02:48:40,457 --> 02:48:45,417
- lt's a sin to burn knowledge.
- l've learnt your knowledge.

1166
02:48:46,329 --> 02:48:50,100
With this knowledge, you took
3 parts of our crop as interest.

1167
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:51,192
And gave us poverty.

1168
02:48:52,102 --> 02:48:55,936
With this knowledge you took
away our fields, our oxen!

1169
02:48:56,106 --> 02:48:59,701
You took away our father and tied
black thread in my mother's wrists!

1170
02:49:02,979 --> 02:49:06,073
One acre of land
for a kilogram of rice.

1171
02:49:06,349 --> 02:49:11,309
You came to deal
for a woman's honour!

1172
02:49:12,622 --> 02:49:15,022
l brought those grams for you!

1173
02:49:15,158 --> 02:49:19,254
l remember everything!

1174
02:49:21,298 --> 02:49:23,391
l will avenge everything.

1175
02:49:24,534 --> 02:49:27,503
You're a dacoit. So am l.

1176
02:49:28,972 --> 02:49:31,202
The law won't spare me.

1177
02:49:31,341 --> 02:49:34,310
l won't spare you.

1178
02:49:48,291 --> 02:49:49,519
Father!

1179
02:49:57,167 --> 02:50:01,433
Your fight was with Sukhi
who is now dead.

1180
02:50:01,605 --> 02:50:02,833
Move out of my way!

1181
02:50:04,107 --> 02:50:07,076
Mother has promised the villagers.

1182
02:50:08,245 --> 02:50:10,338
And l'll give my life for her word.

1183
02:50:11,381 --> 02:50:12,609
But l won't let you touch Rupa!

1184
02:50:30,100 --> 02:50:32,432
Move out!

1185
02:50:34,237 --> 02:50:36,330
Go, mother needs you!

1186
02:50:37,874 --> 02:50:41,469
l've sworn by my mother
l will not spare Rupa!

1187
02:51:05,368 --> 02:51:06,460
No!

1188
02:51:08,238 --> 02:51:10,206
Mother will save me!

1189
02:51:11,374 --> 02:51:12,602
Save me!

1190
02:51:13,243 --> 02:51:15,074
Save me!

1191
02:51:16,379 --> 02:51:17,346
Stop right there.

1192
02:51:18,882 --> 02:51:22,340
Stop, Rupa!

1193
02:51:44,207 --> 02:51:46,038
Save me!

1194
02:51:46,710 --> 02:51:48,177
Let her go.

1195
02:51:48,845 --> 02:51:50,437
Or l'll kill you!

1196
02:51:51,214 --> 02:51:54,308
You cannot kill me.
You are my mother.

1197
02:51:54,718 --> 02:51:57,551
- l'm first a woman.
- l'm your son.

1198
02:51:58,088 --> 02:52:01,421
She is the daughter of the
entire village. Our honour.

1199
02:52:02,492 --> 02:52:05,461
l can give up a son.

1200
02:52:06,730 --> 02:52:07,697
But not my honour!

1201
02:52:07,998 --> 02:52:12,230
Kill me if you can!
l will not break my vow!
