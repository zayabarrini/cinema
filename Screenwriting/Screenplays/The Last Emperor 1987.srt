1
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:15,904
The war criminals will proceed
in orderly fashion...

2
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,739
to the main waiting room
and await instructions

3
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,494
Obey the guards

4
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,543
War criminals must proceed
to the main waiting room

5
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,382
Those caught talking
will be severely punished

6
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,264
The Emperor

7
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,977
Your Majesty...His Majesty

8
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,771
What do they think they are doing?

9
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,064
It is dangerous

10
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,360
Go back

11
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,322
They could kill us all

12
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:41,068
Open the door

13
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:47,908
Open the door!

14
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,414
"PEKING, 1908"

15
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:50,179
By the command of Her lmperial Majesty
...also called the Compassionate

16
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:54,141
...and the Blessed...the
Respectful and the Long Living

17
00:07:54,308 --> 00:08:01,940
The Empress Dowager commands...
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi...Son of Prince Chun...

18
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:06,987
shall be transferred...immediately
...to the Forbidden City...

19
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:12,284
and will remain in the Great Within
awaiting Her Majesty's decision

20
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,995
Respect this

21
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,202
"Ar Mo, I am giving you my Son"

22
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,662
My son is your son

23
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,247
"Quick, quick"

24
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,980
I want to go home

25
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:27,109
Look. Look at the Forbidden City

26
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,539
Give him to me

27
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:27,503
Ar Mo

28
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,034
Pu Yi. Come here

29
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:18,971
Are you afraid of me?

30
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:22,724
Everyone is

31
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,813
I am the Grand Empress Dowager

32
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:33,694
"And I have lived here...
for a long, long time"

33
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:51,170
And they call me the Old Buddha

34
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:58,093
This is Peony

35
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:01,305
Do you like her?

36
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:08,645
"Men, you know...are not allowed
in the Forbidden City after dark"

37
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:14,610
Even little men like you

38
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:20,157
The only man who can live
here...is the Emperor

39
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:29,917
But the Emperor is on high
...ridding the dragon now

40
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:35,422
He died today

41
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:54,775
Longevity

42
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:02,616
These other men...they're not real men

43
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,037
They are all eunuchs

44
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:18,590
And now...they are all
waiting...for me to die

45
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:24,930
That is why...they are putting my
bed...in the middle of the room...

46
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:29,309
under the Black Pearl

47
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,523
Little Pu Yi

48
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:44,700
I have decided...that you will be
the new Lord of Ten Thousand Years

49
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:54,001
You will be the Son of Heaven

50
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,596
"Are we going home, Papa?"

51
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,674
It will soon be over

52
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,720
Look!

53
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,370
Cricket!

54
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,134
"Cricket, where's the cricket?"

55
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:15,596
"He is my friend, Your Majesty"

56
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,640
Safe and warm under my arm

57
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:23,145
Kept me company on the long journey here

58
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:29,484
He is kowtowing to Your Majesty

59
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:34,656
Now he can be the Emperor's cricket

60
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:48,086
"Your Majesty, this is the Forbidden City"

61
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:54,551
This little one is...Your Majesty's bedroom

62
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,136
This is where we are

63
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,721
Am I going home today?

64
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,517
Not today

65
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:08,315
"And here, look"

66
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:25,958
I'll give Your Majesty
the Gate of Marshovala

67
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,513
I don't like baths!

68
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,976
I don't like baths

69
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,650
More beancurd today. And no meat

70
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,420
Is it true I can do anything I want?

71
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,008
Of course Your Majesty. Anything you want

72
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,927
You are the Lord of Ten Thousand Years

73
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:26,727
I am the Son of Heaven!

74
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:33,734
I am the Son of Heaven!

75
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,071
"Ar Mo, I want to go home"

76
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:42,034
"I want to go home, I want to go home,
I want to go home, Ar Mo"

77
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,953
I want to go home

78
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:09,728
Once upon a time...there was a great tree

79
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:13,440
and a great wind

80
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:18,570
And when the tree fell...
the monkeys were scattered

81
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,013
His soup is getting cold

82
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,474
Where am I?

83
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,643
In the People's Republic of China...

84
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:57,025
Why did you stop me?

85
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,695
You are a criminal. You must be judged

86
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:47,284
I repeat...

87
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:51,705
Prisoners going to their cells
will walk with their heads bowed

88
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:53,123
Keep your eyes on the ground

89
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:55,876
No looking forward...or to the side

90
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,253
The Guard will give you directions...

91
00:22:58,337 --> 00:22:59,922
and tell you when to turn

92
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:17,648
Pu Chieh

93
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:43,715
Your guest is waiting to
meet you...Your Majesty

94
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:49,805
Also your mother has arrived

95
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:55,644
"You have not seen your mother
for many years, Your Majesty"

96
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,031
He is so small

97
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,909
"He is young, Your Majesty"

98
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:14,329
Go

99
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:22,963
The Emperor's brother.
His Excellency Pu Chieh

100
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:42,566
Ar Mo

101
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:58,707
How is the health of His Majesty's mother?

102
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:01,001
"It is better, thank you"

103
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,796
How much His Majesty has grown

104
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:11,345
My mother has not seen me for seven years

105
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:17,226
Do you remember my face?

106
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,145
No

107
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:24,483
The night they came with the horses
...I knew it would be like this

108
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,568
My brother sees you every day

109
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:28,612
Pu Chieh is very excited to meet you

110
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,489
He often talks about you

111
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:33,575
We are all very proud of you

112
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,536
The kite

113
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,372
He chose this for you

114
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:54,471
Papa

115
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,596
They're turning away

116
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,099
Of course. Ordinary people are not
allowed to look at the Emperor

117
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:40,684
I'm too important

118
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,687
Is that true that you can
do whatever you want?

119
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:45,189
Of course I can

120
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:48,108
If I am naughty someone else is punished

121
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,235
One of them

122
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:55,199
Stop

123
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:58,285
The Emperor will walk

124
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:11,757
Are they all like you?

125
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,176
I've got three sisters and two friends

126
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:16,512
If you come to our house...
you can play with us

127
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,931
The Emperor never leaves the palace

128
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:22,184
We play games together

129
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,852
I know a game too

130
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:25,187
Run

131
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:23,078
The ones on the boat are the High Consorts

132
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:24,413
High Consorts?

133
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,124
The wives of the Emperor before me

134
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:28,667
They say they're my mother

135
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,378
But they're not

136
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:36,837
Why are you wearing that?
You are not allowed to wear yellow

137
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,132
But it is ordinary yellow

138
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:41,508
It is lmperial yellow

139
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:43,260
"No, it is not"

140
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:44,636
We say it is

141
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,930
Only the Emperor can wear that yellow

142
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:48,056
Take it off

143
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,016
No

144
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:49,933
Take it off

145
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:52,686
"No, and you're not the Emperor any more"

146
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:54,646
There is a new Emperor now

147
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:57,232
He has cut off his queue.
And instead of a camel...

148
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,193
he has got a car

149
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,069
What did you say?

150
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:07,618
You're not the Emperor

151
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,454
Liar

152
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:12,748
You're not the Emperor any more

153
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,549
You're not the Emperor

154
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:25,344
You're not the Emperor

155
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:26,678
How dare you!

156
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,317
You're not the Emperor!

157
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,486
How dare you

158
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:48,867
Am I the Emperor or not?

159
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:52,454
Your Majesty...will always be the Emperor

160
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:53,956
You see

161
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,582
Prove it

162
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,002
Big Foot

163
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:04,383
Drink it

164
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:08,303
Drink the green ink

165
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:29,449
I will show you

166
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,315
"See, that is a car"

167
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:03,859
He is the President of the Republic

168
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:06,380
"Why is this wall here, Lord Chamberlain?"

169
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:11,426
"It is just a wall, Your Majesty.
Nothing has changed here"

170
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:13,846
You are lying

171
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:29,528
High Tutor

172
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,738
Am I still the Emperor?

173
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:36,368
You will always be the Emperor...
inside the Forbidden City...

174
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:38,829
but not outside

175
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,789
I do not understand

176
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:44,668
Outside China is now a Republic...

177
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:46,420
with a President

178
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,174
Where is Ar Mo?

179
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,117
You are all liars

180
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:25,542
Let me say goodbye

181
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:27,252
Hurry

182
00:35:32,216 --> 00:35:33,800
He's my child

183
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,544
I do not understand

184
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:11,463
I do not understand

185
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:13,715
Your Majesty is a big boy now

186
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:16,552
He cannot have a wet nurse any more

187
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:18,345
It is much better like this

188
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,097
Much healthier

189
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:22,432
But she is not my wet nurse

190
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:26,520
She is my butterfly

191
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:46,290
Ar Mo

192
00:36:54,423 --> 00:37:01,805
Ar Mo

193
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:02,616
This is the detention centre...

194
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:05,285
of the Fushun Bureau of Public Security...

195
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:07,913
and I am the Governer

196
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:12,042
During the war...this was a Japanese prison

197
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:14,002
Many of you may remember it...

198
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:17,089
because you worked with the Japanese

199
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,758
You were responsible for building it...

200
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:23,011
and you filled it with innocent people

201
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:25,013
How could this happen?

202
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:26,807
Why did you betray your country?

203
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:29,560
What turned you into war criminals?

204
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:33,063
We believe...that men are born good

205
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,525
We believe...that the only way to change...

206
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:40,362
is to discover the truth
and look at it in the face

207
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:43,156
That is why you are here

208
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,952
You will begin by writing
the story of your lives...

209
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,079
and by confessing your crimes

210
00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:51,832
Your salvation will lie entirely...

211
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:55,919
in the attitude you take

212
00:38:56,128 --> 00:38:59,965
I advise you to be frank and sincere

213
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:05,512
Otherwise things can still
go very badly for you

214
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:21,862
TWILIGHTIN THE FORBIDDEN CITY

215
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:34,499
After a few years the Chinese Republic...

216
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:37,252
had become as corrupt as the old empire

217
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:42,257
It fell quickly into the hands of
ambitious generals and corrupt bureaucrats

218
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:46,178
The era of the warlords had begun

219
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:49,223
By May 1919 when I had
received my appointment...

220
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:51,975
China was in turmoil

221
00:41:57,518 --> 00:42:00,646
May the new tutor present himself

222
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,830
Your lmperial Highness...the new tutor

223
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,752
Mr Reginald Fleming Johnston

224
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:27,256
"How do you do, Mr Johnston?"

225
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:31,051
"How do you do, Your Majesty"

226
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:44,731
Now we will go to school

227
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:46,316
Your Majesty...

228
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,363
in my country it would be usual to begin
...with some kind of an examination

229
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:54,449
The Emperor cannot be examined

230
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:56,952
Now that my have to change

231
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:01,498
But first your Majesty might
like to ask me some questions?

232
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:06,712
Where are your ancestors buried?

233
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:09,131
"In Scotland, Your Majesty"

234
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:13,468
But then where's your skirt?

235
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:16,722
"In your country men wear
short skirts, do they not?"

236
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:19,683
"No, Your Majesty, Scotsmen
do not wear skirts..."

237
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:22,269
they wear kilts

238
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:24,855
Kilts?

239
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,107
A matter of words

240
00:43:27,232 --> 00:43:29,276
perhaps but words are important

241
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:30,944
Why are words important?

242
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:33,864
"If you cannot say what
you mean, Your Majesty..."

243
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:36,491
you will never mean what you say

244
00:43:36,617 --> 00:43:40,746
And a gentleman should
always mean what he says

245
00:43:40,954 --> 00:43:43,290
Ah yes! A gentleman

246
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:46,627
Are you a gentleman?

247
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:50,380
"I would like to be a gentleman, Your Majesty"

248
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:52,424
I try to be

249
00:43:52,508 --> 00:43:54,134
I am not a gentleman

250
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,887
I'm not allowed to say what I mean

251
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:59,598
They are always telling me what to say

252
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:04,645
Your Majesty is still very young

253
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:10,817
I thought he might like to see
some English and American magazines

254
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:14,363
I have just received them

255
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:24,456
I know that you know...
that I know that you know...

256
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:28,669
that that is a dialogue between
Confucious...and Chuang-Tsu

257
00:44:29,169 --> 00:44:33,924
"Concerning respect, Your Majesty"

258
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:48,689
Who is this George Washington?

259
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:51,483
"A famous American, Your Majesty"

260
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:54,903
"A revolutionary General,
the first American President"

261
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:57,656
"Ah, like Mr Lenin in Russia?"

262
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:00,534
Not quiet

263
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,662
Does he have a car?

264
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:07,583
"He lived a long time ago, Your Majesty"

265
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:11,503
I want a car

266
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:19,678
"I think your mouse is trying to escape,
Your Majesty"

267
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:28,770
Please do not tell anyone about my mouse

268
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:40,532
The lesson is finished

269
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:13,607
Our official taster is a brave man

270
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:19,321
"Many of my ancestors have
been poisoned, you know"

271
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:24,826
Does Your Majesty have lunch
like this every day?

272
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:27,538
"Oh, yes, every day. Like theatre"

273
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:30,415
I do not know why.
It has always been like that

274
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:38,549
How do they kill Emperor's in the West?

275
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,845
"The Austrian Emperor was shot, was he not?"

276
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:47,349
But this nephew was assassinated
before the Great War

277
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:49,810
But the Russian Emperor has been shot

278
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:51,353
He was called the Tsar

279
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:55,274
He took lots of our land in Manchuria

280
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,817
I'm a Manchurian

281
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:00,904
"Even after the Republic,
it's still my country"

282
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:08,704
"The, er...secret,
Your Majesty, is emerging again"

283
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:29,474
Something is happening

284
00:47:34,563 --> 00:47:36,231
"What is happening, Mr Johnston?"

285
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:39,193
Nothing is Quiet

286
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:24,488
"On our way here, Your Majesty..."

287
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:27,866
we were held up by
students from a University

288
00:48:28,534 --> 00:48:31,495
They were protesting against
the Republican Government...

289
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:35,916
because it has agreed to give
away Chinese territory...to Japan

290
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:40,379
"Is it true, Mr Johnston..."

291
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:42,506
that many people out there have
had their heads chopped off?

292
00:48:42,965 --> 00:48:44,925
"It is true, Your Majesty..."

293
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:48,303
many heads have been chopped off

294
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,641
It does stop them thinking

295
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:55,060
It is time for the Emperor's rest

296
00:48:55,185 --> 00:48:58,355
The students are right to be angry

297
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:05,904
I am angry

298
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:10,576
But I'm not allowed to
leave the Forbidden City

299
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:14,329
"I want to go out, Mr Johnston"

300
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:20,502
"My Lord, I want to see the city of sounds"

301
00:49:28,468 --> 00:49:32,264
The Emperor awards you...with
the order of the Ruby Hat Button...

302
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:37,477
and with the right to be carried in
your own chair with four bearers

303
00:51:26,545 --> 00:51:28,964
I hope the Emperor has not forgotten...

304
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:32,342
that this is the day for his maths class

305
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:41,768
For Your Majesty

306
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:44,271
My doctor said bicycles are bad for you

307
00:51:44,396 --> 00:51:46,732
"Bad for you, nonsense"

308
00:51:55,824 --> 00:51:56,950
How does it work?

309
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:00,329
Oh...it's simple

310
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:06,460
Head up and eyes forward as in life

311
00:52:32,903 --> 00:52:34,196
"My Mother's dead, is she not?"

312
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:39,409
"Yes, Your Majesty. I'm profoundly sorry"

313
00:52:39,618 --> 00:52:41,078
I'm not

314
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:46,917
She killed herself

315
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:50,003
She swallowed a ball of opium

316
00:52:51,088 --> 00:52:54,716
"I'm going to see her, and my brother"

317
00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:26,433
Open the door

318
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:30,103
Open the door!

319
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:47,371
Open the door!

320
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:42,676
Look where you lead him

321
00:55:42,759 --> 00:55:46,263
"And you are an old, cruel, ignorant man"

322
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:47,639
The boy's Mother is dead

323
00:55:47,973 --> 00:55:50,267
and he's not even allowed to see her

324
00:55:50,726 --> 00:55:53,729
I want to go out! I want to go out!

325
00:55:54,104 --> 00:55:56,023
Stop it. Stay where you are

326
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:57,316
I want to go out

327
00:55:57,399 --> 00:55:59,401
Stop it! Stay where you are

328
00:55:59,484 --> 00:56:00,611
I want to go out!

329
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:08,619
Hunchback. Big Foot

330
00:56:37,189 --> 00:56:42,736
"Give me your hand, sir"

331
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,909
"Give me your hand, sir"

332
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:15,102
"Look at my left ear please, sir"

333
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:20,858
And now my right

334
00:57:22,317 --> 00:57:25,821
"Would you follow my finger please, sir"

335
00:57:32,494 --> 00:57:34,079
"Well, it's perfectly simple Johnstone"

336
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:36,665
The Emperor needs spectacles

337
00:57:36,915 --> 00:57:38,750
Like Harold Lloyd

338
00:57:39,126 --> 00:57:40,586
Impossible

339
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:42,921
An Emperor does not wear spectacles

340
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:45,549
That cannot be allowed

341
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:48,594
"Times have changed, Your Highnesses"

342
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:06,320
"If His Majesty doesn't get
spectacles, Johnston..."

343
00:58:06,445 --> 00:58:08,113
he could lose his sight

344
00:58:32,221 --> 00:58:35,933
"If the Emperor does not get spectacles,
I will resign"

345
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:39,561
"Unfortunately, our decision is final..."

346
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,522
and unfortunately what I have to say...

347
00:58:41,647 --> 00:58:45,901
will be published in every newspaper in China

348
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:51,823
"What do you have to say, Mr Johnston?"

349
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:55,702
The Emperor has been a
prisoner in his own palace...

350
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:57,704
since the day that he was crowned...

351
00:58:57,788 --> 00:58:59,957
and has remained a prisoner
since he abdicated

352
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:03,252
"But, now he's growing up...he may wonder
why he's the only person in China"

353
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:06,129
who may not walk out of his own front door

354
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:12,678
I think the Emperor is the
loneliest boy on earth

355
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:19,184
It would be conveniently sad...
if he becomes blind

356
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:22,104
Blind...Mr Johnston?

357
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,482
"To the expense, Your Excellency"

358
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:29,152
To the cost of maintaining one
thousand two hundred Eunuchs...

359
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:31,238
three hundred and fifty ladies-in-waiting...

360
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:34,449
and one hundred and eighty-five cooks

361
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:37,661
To buying one hundred and
twenty sable furs a month...

362
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:40,038
and three thousand chickens a week

363
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:43,542
To the fact that eight hundred
and forty Guards and employees...

364
00:59:43,709 --> 00:59:47,504
of the Household Department
plus one Lord Chamberlain...

365
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:49,631
care only about one thing...

366
00:59:49,756 --> 00:59:52,885
filling their own rice bowls

367
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:56,680
"You are very good at accounts, Mr Johnston"

368
00:59:57,222 --> 00:59:59,308
The Emperor may have abdicated...

369
00:59:59,725 --> 01:00:04,271
but he is still a symbol of
great importance...to many people

370
01:00:05,606 --> 01:00:09,067
If I did not agree with
that I would not be here

371
01:00:10,569 --> 01:00:16,700
And some of us believe...that one
day soon he may be more than a symbol

372
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:20,204
The spectacles are a detail

373
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:23,040
"What do you really want, Mr Johnston?"

374
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:27,085
Just the spectacles

375
01:01:18,554 --> 01:01:21,306
"Oh no...The Princess Wan Jung, Your Majesty"

376
01:01:21,723 --> 01:01:23,642
Seventeen years old

377
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:34,695
"Princess Who Jen, fifteen years old"

378
01:01:35,195 --> 01:01:37,447
"The Princess Li Li, Your Majesty"

379
01:01:39,157 --> 01:01:42,244
And the Princess Fun Ying

380
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,175
Who is this?

381
01:01:56,925 --> 01:01:59,720
"Princess Wen Hsiu, twelve years old"

382
01:02:00,137 --> 01:02:01,972
She has got a funny face

383
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,318
Not just one wife

384
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:16,653
One Empress and one Secondary Consort

385
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:17,988
Two wives

386
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:20,324
"But, who did you choose to be the Empress?"

387
01:02:20,449 --> 01:02:22,659
"They chose her, she's very old, Johnston"

388
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:24,119
She's seventeen

389
01:02:24,995 --> 01:02:27,289
"That's not so old, Your Majesty"

390
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:28,832
What does she look like?

391
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:30,167
Old-fashioned

392
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:32,169
"I want a modern wife, Johnston"

393
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:35,005
Who speaks English and French

394
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:39,718
And who can dance the quickstep

395
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:53,023
Johnston

396
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:58,904
"I'm going to escape, Johnston"

397
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:02,074
I've got a suitcase and a ticket to English

398
01:03:02,241 --> 01:03:04,993
I'm going to Oxford University

399
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:08,539
Your Majesty...if you get married...

400
01:03:08,705 --> 01:03:11,917
you will become the master of your own house

401
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:16,088
A wedding might be a more
practical way to escape

402
01:03:49,955 --> 01:03:52,749
"Why did you never get married, Johnston?"

403
01:04:03,969 --> 01:04:07,806
The Secondary Consort welcomes the Empress

404
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:11,351
The Empress greets the Secondary Consort

405
01:04:22,196 --> 01:04:23,947
You are doing everything every well

406
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:26,533
Thank you. I rehearsed many times

407
01:05:25,884 --> 01:05:28,262
What is his Majesty thinking?

408
01:05:28,637 --> 01:05:31,014
I was thinking if I was a real Emperor...

409
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:33,392
I would become the ruler of China now

410
01:05:34,434 --> 01:05:36,812
And what would the Emperor do...

411
01:05:36,937 --> 01:05:38,355
if he could really rule?

412
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,773
I would change everything

413
01:05:39,857 --> 01:05:41,859
Even the way we get married

414
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:45,445
Is the Emperor against arranged marriages?

415
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:49,408
It is humiliating not to
choose whom you marry

416
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:52,828
Even I was not allowed to choose

417
01:06:06,717 --> 01:06:08,051
In another year or two...

418
01:06:08,427 --> 01:06:10,345
His Majesty will be taller than me

419
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:14,975
Is it true the Emperor has
a suitcase under his bed...

420
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,603
and is going to Oxford

421
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:20,731
Will the Emperor take Wan Jung with him?

422
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:26,945
Perhaps he would like to
see my face before he decides

423
01:06:27,613 --> 01:06:32,284
The Emperor would like to see
the face of the Empress

424
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:41,460
It is the Emperor who
must remove the kai t'ou

425
01:07:41,812 --> 01:07:46,066
I also had a tutor...like Mr Johnston

426
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:50,195
Miss Windsor

427
01:07:53,115 --> 01:07:55,117
She's American

428
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:25,731
Miss Windsor taught me how to
do the dance of the quickstep

429
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:30,569
Does the Emperor know how to do the quickstep?

430
01:08:31,236 --> 01:08:34,364
Will you teach me?

431
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:29,336
"Leave us, leave us"

432
01:09:47,604 --> 01:09:51,608
If Your Majesty thinks...
it is old fashioned...

433
01:09:51,817 --> 01:09:55,112
to make the rain and
the wind with a stranger...

434
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:58,031
we can be like a modern
couple...to begin with

435
01:09:58,782 --> 01:10:00,909
A modern couple?

436
01:10:02,494 --> 01:10:05,914
Goodnight! Goodnight!

437
01:10:14,173 --> 01:10:18,260
You must come to Oxford with me

438
01:10:24,308 --> 01:10:25,893
I like him

439
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,938
I am sure I am going to like him

440
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:31,940
And he will grow up

441
01:10:35,152 --> 01:10:37,362
Eyes down

442
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:45,370
Report your arrival

443
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:47,915
Prisoner 981 reporting

444
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:48,999
Louder!

445
01:10:49,082 --> 01:10:51,251
Prisoner 981 reporting!

446
01:10:51,668 --> 01:10:53,045
Open the door

447
01:10:59,259 --> 01:11:01,428
Close the door

448
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:04,932
Sit down

449
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,564
Name?

450
01:11:12,814 --> 01:11:14,566
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi

451
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:16,068
Write it

452
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:40,926
Now then...there are two types of confession

453
01:11:41,552 --> 01:11:44,179
We call them toothpaste...

454
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:45,764
and water tap

455
01:11:46,223 --> 01:11:50,602
The toothpaste prisoner needs to
be squeezed every now and then...

456
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:53,021
or else he forgets to keep confessing

457
01:11:54,565 --> 01:11:59,444
The water tap man...needs one good
hard twist before he starts...

458
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:01,989
but then everything comes out

459
01:12:02,406 --> 01:12:06,201
Now...you're an intelligent person

460
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:08,787
I'm sure you understand me?

461
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:13,000
Good. Then we'll begin

462
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:17,421
Why do you think you're in here 981?

463
01:12:17,838 --> 01:12:19,882
I am accused of being a traitor...

464
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:22,968
a collaborator and a counter revolutionary

465
01:12:23,552 --> 01:12:25,971
It is not an accusation! You are a traitor!

466
01:12:26,096 --> 01:12:30,684
You are a collaborator and you
are a counter revolutionary

467
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:38,275
Did you write this?

468
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:40,986
And you call it a confession?

469
01:12:41,445 --> 01:12:43,530
This is nothing but a list of dates

470
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:45,365
A child's fairy tale

471
01:12:56,793 --> 01:12:58,170
What do you want me to confess?

472
01:12:58,253 --> 01:12:59,713
You know what you did...

473
01:13:00,088 --> 01:13:01,590
and what others did

474
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:03,926
So why don't you volunteer the information?

475
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:05,594
I do not understand

476
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:08,680
We don't tell people what to confess

477
01:13:08,805 --> 01:13:11,016
We already know everything about you

478
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:22,110
I...

479
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:26,657
I wanted reforms

480
01:13:27,032 --> 01:13:30,035
What did you want to...reform?

481
01:13:30,494 --> 01:13:32,454
Everything

482
01:13:34,289 --> 01:13:35,791
Cut off my queue

483
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:39,628
"Your Majesty, please"

484
01:14:14,496 --> 01:14:15,956
It is heavy

485
01:14:16,331 --> 01:14:18,292
The Emperor before me was murdered...

486
01:14:18,417 --> 01:14:21,545
because he wanted to reform the Empire

487
01:14:21,712 --> 01:14:23,589
"Is that no so, Mr Johnston?"

488
01:14:23,714 --> 01:14:26,508
"Yes, Your Majesty...probably"

489
01:14:29,094 --> 01:14:33,724
Well...let's see if they will kill me
for reforming the Forbidden City

490
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:38,061
I am appointing Mr Johnston's friend...

491
01:14:38,187 --> 01:14:42,065
the poet and scholar Chen Hsiao-Hsiu
...to be the new Lord Chamberlain

492
01:14:42,482 --> 01:14:47,237
I want him to supervise a detailed
inventory...of the lmperial storerooms

493
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:51,950
So that we can learn exactly
how much has been stolen

494
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:52,159
29.970

495
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:06,256
The Forbidden City had become
a theatre without an audience

496
01:15:06,798 --> 01:15:10,093
So why did the actors remain on the stage?

497
01:15:11,678 --> 01:15:17,184
It was only to steal the
scenery...piece by piece

498
01:15:29,321 --> 01:15:33,325
Can I sleep here? I am frightened

499
01:15:48,799 --> 01:15:50,968
You're brave

500
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:52,761
Are you not frightened?

501
01:15:54,137 --> 01:15:55,305
I am excited

502
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:57,558
I do not want to escape anymore

503
01:15:58,725 --> 01:16:01,144
I want to rule

504
01:16:03,772 --> 01:16:06,024
Kiss me

505
01:16:37,347 --> 01:16:40,475
Can I stay with you as well?

506
01:16:41,768 --> 01:16:44,479
Get in. Get in

507
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:08,587
I used to play a game with the Eunuchs...

508
01:17:10,881 --> 01:17:15,427
trying to guess who is who

509
01:17:16,053 --> 01:17:18,847
Now I cannot see you

510
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:24,806
"The storerooms are on fire, Your Majesty"

511
01:19:40,322 --> 01:19:42,366
The fire was a terrible disaster

512
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:44,952
And I knew that Eunuchs had started it...

513
01:19:45,118 --> 01:19:47,204
to stop me from knowing what they had stolen

514
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:51,333
There has been Eunuchs in the
Forbidden City...for eight hundred years

515
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,211
There were still more
than a thousand of them

516
01:19:54,336 --> 01:19:56,255
I decided to expel them all

517
01:19:56,672 --> 01:20:00,050
I had to ask for
Republican troops to help me

518
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:05,365
What are they carrying?

519
01:21:06,825 --> 01:21:08,744
Their organs

520
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:10,829
Whatever their crimes...

521
01:21:10,954 --> 01:21:15,584
they cannot be deprived of the
right...to be buried as whole men

522
01:22:18,021 --> 01:22:19,731
I...I forgot what I was saying

523
01:22:19,815 --> 01:22:21,650
You're wasting our time

524
01:22:21,733 --> 01:22:24,486
We want to know about the Japanese

525
01:22:25,445 --> 01:22:28,031
How did your friendship
with the Japanese begin?

526
01:22:28,156 --> 01:22:30,158
Who introduced you? When?

527
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:37,583
I think it was...it was 1924

528
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:40,002
Parliament had been dissolved again

529
01:22:40,127 --> 01:22:41,336
The President had fled

530
01:22:41,712 --> 01:22:49,052
At first I thought it was just another
...coup d'etat by just another warlord

531
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:52,931
Only this time it was different

532
01:22:53,765 --> 01:22:56,560
This time it was my turn

533
01:22:57,978 --> 01:22:59,938
Fifteen love

534
01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:23,170
Play

535
01:23:30,177 --> 01:23:33,305
Thirty-fifteen

536
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:06,213
The rotten Government of
the Republic is in flight

537
01:24:07,089 --> 01:24:09,091
Now we shall remove the foreign stench...

538
01:24:09,216 --> 01:24:13,011
of the Manchurian rats who still
hide in the Forbidden City

539
01:24:23,313 --> 01:24:25,941
Mr Pu Yi and his family...

540
01:24:26,066 --> 01:24:29,820
have been given one hour
to leave the Forbidden City

541
01:24:31,572 --> 01:24:35,784
They will be escorted...to the
home of his Father and remain...

542
01:24:35,993 --> 01:24:39,162
there under guard as state prisoners...

543
01:24:39,329 --> 01:24:41,540
until further notice

544
01:24:47,754 --> 01:24:49,631
What are you all looking at?

545
01:24:50,007 --> 01:24:51,967
What are you standing there for?

546
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:53,969
You always wanted to
leave the Forbidden City

547
01:24:54,386 --> 01:24:55,929
Now you have got an hour to pack

548
01:24:56,054 --> 01:24:59,892
So go

549
01:25:12,905 --> 01:25:15,949
I always thought I hated it here

550
01:25:16,575 --> 01:25:18,869
But now I am afraid to leave

551
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:20,495
Do you think they will kill me?

552
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:22,915
"You must do as they say, Your Majesty..."

553
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,125
while I try to reach the British Embassy

554
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:27,169
They will give you asylum there

555
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:30,047
I'm sure they will

556
01:25:31,548 --> 01:25:35,427
Chang...take my car to the South gate.
I want you to drive His Majesty

557
01:27:27,164 --> 01:27:28,248
"Please, Your Majesty"

558
01:27:28,332 --> 01:27:29,958
What?

559
01:28:16,964 --> 01:28:20,217
"But you didn't go to the
British Embassy, did you?"

560
01:28:20,509 --> 01:28:22,553
You ended up at the Japanese Embassy

561
01:28:22,636 --> 01:28:25,430
The Japanese were the only people
prepared to help me

562
01:28:25,597 --> 01:28:27,140
Help you for nothing?

563
01:28:29,309 --> 01:28:32,813
Japan has an Emperor.
We are almost the same age

564
01:28:33,313 --> 01:28:35,524
I thought it was kindness

565
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:39,444
The same time I relised that
for many Chinese...

566
01:28:39,611 --> 01:28:41,154
I was an alien

567
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,782
Simply because I am Manchurian

568
01:28:44,533 --> 01:28:49,454
There was even an Anti-Manchurian
League who wanted to assassinate me

569
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:53,250
So I went to live in Tientsin

570
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:59,381
It was a nice...provincial town
...with a big port

571
01:28:59,631 --> 01:29:03,635
In those days it had a large
International Settlement

572
01:29:03,802 --> 01:29:06,096
The Japanese thought it
would be safer for me there

573
01:29:06,221 --> 01:29:08,807
Were the Japanese paying
for you in Tientsin?

574
01:29:08,974 --> 01:29:12,811
"Oh, no. I had to rent a villa"

575
01:29:12,978 --> 01:29:17,149
The villa Chang...and it was very expensive

576
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:20,110
"So, were the bodyguards"

577
01:29:20,277 --> 01:29:22,279
I spent a lot of money in Tientsin

578
01:29:22,404 --> 01:29:26,408
Did you still believe in the
restoration of the lmperial system

579
01:29:26,617 --> 01:29:27,826
Others did

580
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:30,204
The little court-in-exile

581
01:29:31,246 --> 01:29:35,042
I cannot remember how much
jade and jewellery...

582
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:37,294
they made me spend to buy the
friendship of some warlord...

583
01:29:37,419 --> 01:29:39,922
or some...white Russian general

584
01:29:40,047 --> 01:29:41,798
And what else did you spend your money on?

585
01:29:41,882 --> 01:29:44,426
"Oh, I was never tired of buying pianos..."

586
01:29:44,551 --> 01:29:46,762
"watches, radios"

587
01:29:46,887 --> 01:29:48,889
As long as they were foreign

588
01:29:49,014 --> 01:29:53,018
Of course. Anything Western was good

589
01:29:53,227 --> 01:29:56,188
"Especially Wrigley's chewing gum,
Bayer aspirin..."

590
01:29:56,355 --> 01:29:57,397
and cars

591
01:29:57,481 --> 01:29:59,316
While you were in Tientsin...

592
01:29:59,858 --> 01:30:03,612
most of China came under the control
of General Chiang Kai Shek...

593
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:07,699
the so-called Nationalists...the Kuomintang

594
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:10,327
What were your relations with them?

595
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:12,746
None

596
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:16,583
I felt useless in Tientsin

597
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,585
I was twenty-one

598
01:30:19,628 --> 01:30:22,506
I dreamt of going to the West

599
01:30:23,715 --> 01:30:25,425
I became a playboy

600
01:31:22,357 --> 01:31:25,402
"Tientsin, 1927"

601
01:31:58,644 --> 01:32:00,229
BRITISH INDIA STEAM NAVIGATION COMPAN

602
01:32:09,571 --> 01:32:12,991
That's a great ship...
if you're going first class

603
01:32:15,327 --> 01:32:17,538
I'm not going anywhere

604
01:32:21,917 --> 01:32:23,877
Would you like to dance?

605
01:32:32,803 --> 01:32:34,137
You are a brave man

606
01:32:34,221 --> 01:32:35,889
Nobody here would have danced with me

607
01:32:36,431 --> 01:32:37,516
Why's that?

608
01:32:39,476 --> 01:32:40,978
Because I am Chinese

609
01:32:41,937 --> 01:32:43,438
Well...l'm American

610
01:32:54,491 --> 01:32:55,742
You say California.

611
01:32:56,118 --> 01:32:57,703
I say French Riviera

612
01:32:57,786 --> 01:32:59,079
San Fransisco

613
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:00,747
Monte Carlo

614
01:33:02,124 --> 01:33:05,002
Are we really going this time?

615
01:33:13,969 --> 01:33:15,304
Who's that couple?

616
01:33:16,054 --> 01:33:17,556
"Oh, Henry and Elizabeth"

617
01:33:19,141 --> 01:33:20,350
The Emperor of China?

618
01:33:20,767 --> 01:33:22,644
The ex-Emperor and his wife

619
01:33:25,063 --> 01:33:26,356
She's beautiful

620
01:33:26,648 --> 01:33:28,150
"Yes, very"

621
01:33:28,567 --> 01:33:29,610
And who are you?

622
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:32,362
I am His Highness' other wife

623
01:33:32,779 --> 01:33:33,864
His other wife?

624
01:33:33,947 --> 01:33:35,574
Number two wife

625
01:33:37,326 --> 01:33:39,328
"Well, some people have all the luck"

626
01:33:55,385 --> 01:33:57,679
Ladies and Gentlemen

627
01:34:00,349 --> 01:34:04,561
General Chiang Kai Shek...has taken Shanghai

628
01:34:04,895 --> 01:34:08,524
The Kuomintang have broken with the Reds

629
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:09,900
and they've knocked them for six

630
01:34:09,983 --> 01:34:13,403
The Reds are finished!

631
01:34:18,825 --> 01:34:20,452
Sorry about the reception everyone.
We'll have it fixed in a minute

632
01:34:21,453 --> 01:34:25,249
"It would be wiser to return to the
Japanese Legation now, Your Majesty"

633
01:34:25,624 --> 01:34:26,750
Your car is waiting

634
01:34:26,792 --> 01:34:28,752
"Thank you, Mr Amakasu"

635
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:45,686
The General strike in Shanghai has collapsed

636
01:34:46,854 --> 01:34:49,898
The International Settlement is safe

637
01:34:50,607 --> 01:34:55,195
Troops of the Kuomintang are now
in fall control of the city

638
01:34:55,404 --> 01:35:00,492
And firm steps are being taken to
restore order...in the native areas

639
01:35:10,043 --> 01:35:13,088
Wen Hsiu. You want some gum?

640
01:35:16,758 --> 01:35:19,219
I want a divorce

641
01:35:25,058 --> 01:35:28,228
I do not want to be your mistress any longer

642
01:35:28,729 --> 01:35:30,814
I thought you were my Secondary Consort

643
01:35:30,898 --> 01:35:33,108
In the Forbidden City you were the Emperor...

644
01:35:33,233 --> 01:35:35,360
and I was a Secondary Consort

645
01:35:36,486 --> 01:35:38,947
But now your are Henry Pu Yi...

646
01:35:39,239 --> 01:35:42,075
"Wan Jung is your wife, Elizabeth"

647
01:35:43,952 --> 01:35:46,413
And who am I?

648
01:35:47,331 --> 01:35:50,167
I'm nobody

649
01:35:59,009 --> 01:36:01,762
I did not know you were so unhappy

650
01:36:06,725 --> 01:36:10,145
You can only have one wife in the West

651
01:36:15,317 --> 01:36:17,277
I want a divorce

652
01:36:17,653 --> 01:36:20,531
No one can divorce me

653
01:36:44,096 --> 01:36:46,139
I want a divorce

654
01:37:21,508 --> 01:37:28,515
Your Ladyship

655
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:50,871
I do not need it

656
01:37:55,417 --> 01:37:58,170
I do not need it

657
01:38:39,711 --> 01:38:41,880
Can I come in?

658
01:38:42,756 --> 01:38:44,508
Don't you remember me?

659
01:38:45,133 --> 01:38:47,261
"I'm dressed like a pilot,
but I still can't fly"

660
01:38:47,678 --> 01:38:48,804
Not yet

661
01:38:48,887 --> 01:38:51,431
Eastern Jewel. We had dancing classes together

662
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:53,725
"Yes, just before your marriage"

663
01:38:54,393 --> 01:38:57,229
You silly girl.
Why do people want to get married?

664
01:38:57,771 --> 01:38:59,189
Wen Hsiu has gone

665
01:39:00,649 --> 01:39:02,276
She will never come back

666
01:39:02,734 --> 01:39:04,570
Is that so bad?

667
01:39:05,487 --> 01:39:07,364
She was my only friend

668
01:39:09,116 --> 01:39:12,411
"Well, at least now you've got
a husband all to yourself'

669
01:39:14,204 --> 01:39:15,873
And you've got me

670
01:39:17,666 --> 01:39:19,960
I'll be your friend

671
01:39:20,294 --> 01:39:21,378
You smoke opium?

672
01:39:21,461 --> 01:39:24,131
Be wicked. It's the best in Shanghai

673
01:39:25,883 --> 01:39:27,676
Why are you going to Europe?

674
01:39:27,801 --> 01:39:29,386
The place to go is Japan

675
01:39:29,511 --> 01:39:31,346
It's more fun than anywhere

676
01:39:32,598 --> 01:39:34,308
It's modern

677
01:39:35,517 --> 01:39:37,603
How do you know we are going to Europe?

678
01:39:37,728 --> 01:39:39,062
It is a secret

679
01:39:39,396 --> 01:39:41,190
"Oh, I know everything"

680
01:39:41,648 --> 01:39:45,444
I know Chiang Kai Shek has got false teeth

681
01:39:45,903 --> 01:39:48,614
"I even know his nickname, "Cash-my-check"

682
01:39:52,576 --> 01:39:55,078
I'm a spy

683
01:39:55,495 --> 01:39:57,164
And I don't care who knows it

684
01:39:57,539 --> 01:39:58,749
A spy?

685
01:39:58,832 --> 01:40:00,959
I work for the Japanese
Special Service Bureau...

686
01:40:01,418 --> 01:40:03,462
and I've come to protect you

687
01:40:04,796 --> 01:40:06,548
The Japanese?

688
01:40:07,633 --> 01:40:10,344
They are getting closer to him every day

689
01:40:11,678 --> 01:40:15,807
He is sending his brother...
to the Military Academy in Tokyo

690
01:40:16,141 --> 01:40:19,019
They talk to him about
Manchuria all the time

691
01:40:20,521 --> 01:40:24,107
And Mr Amakasu never says hello to me

692
01:40:24,316 --> 01:40:26,068
I do not trust the Japanese

693
01:40:37,287 --> 01:40:39,957
"Of course, I'd love to be the
Emperor's new Secondary Consort"

694
01:40:40,123 --> 01:40:41,583
Eastern Jewel

695
01:40:41,834 --> 01:40:44,211
If the past available

696
01:41:02,187 --> 01:41:04,857
"The post is vacant, my dear cousin..."

697
01:41:07,109 --> 01:41:10,028
but you do not fit the part

698
01:41:12,489 --> 01:41:14,908
Wen Hsiu left her dog behind.
Do you want it?

699
01:41:17,703 --> 01:41:22,165
It is my fault. It is all my fault

700
01:41:54,489 --> 01:41:56,909
"I came to see you, Your Majesty..."

701
01:41:57,701 --> 01:42:00,162
to give you bad news

702
01:42:00,621 --> 01:42:02,623
Something terrible has happened

703
01:42:08,587 --> 01:42:14,718
The lmperial tombs of our Manchurian
ancestors have been attacked...

704
01:42:15,135 --> 01:42:17,137
and robbed...by troops of the Kuomintang

705
01:42:17,513 --> 01:42:19,139
Chinese soldiers

706
01:42:19,765 --> 01:42:23,268
A warlord working for Chiang Kai Shek

707
01:42:25,896 --> 01:42:32,027
The body of the Empress Dowager...
was hacked to pieces

708
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:36,073
Her pearl necklace has
became a wedding present

709
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:40,744
from Chiang Kai Shek...to his new wife

710
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:03,058
Tell me 981 ...

711
01:43:03,141 --> 01:43:04,768
do you consider yourself to be Chinese?

712
01:43:04,893 --> 01:43:05,811
Of course

713
01:43:06,186 --> 01:43:07,020
What is this?

714
01:43:07,104 --> 01:43:08,313
Japan

715
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,107
And what do you call this part of China

716
01:43:10,232 --> 01:43:11,316
The North East

717
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:12,776
And what did you call it as a child?

718
01:43:12,901 --> 01:43:14,444
Manchuria

719
01:43:14,695 --> 01:43:17,364
Japan invaded Manchuria

720
01:43:17,489 --> 01:43:18,824
"on September 18th, 1931"

721
01:43:18,907 --> 01:43:21,660
And began to set up a puppet
state called Manchukuo

722
01:43:21,827 --> 01:43:24,705
"Shorty afterwards, a Japanese Delegation..."

723
01:43:24,872 --> 01:43:26,373
paid you a secret visit in Tientsin...

724
01:43:26,456 --> 01:43:27,791
to request your collaboration

725
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:29,543
Which you say you refused?

726
01:43:29,585 --> 01:43:31,211
Speak up

727
01:43:31,503 --> 01:43:33,964
I already told you.
I have told you a hundred times

728
01:43:34,089 --> 01:43:35,966
Tell us again. Tell us two hundred times

729
01:43:36,091 --> 01:43:37,843
I refused to collaborate

730
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:40,512
"You say you refused, but a month later..."

731
01:43:40,929 --> 01:43:43,098
"on November 10th, 1931 ..."

732
01:43:43,515 --> 01:43:46,018
there you are arriving in Manchuria...

733
01:43:46,143 --> 01:43:48,145
or shall I call it Manchukuo?

734
01:43:48,604 --> 01:43:50,981
"Now, according to this
so-called confession of yours..."

735
01:43:51,106 --> 01:43:52,816
you didn't go of your own free will

736
01:43:52,941 --> 01:43:55,277
You insisted you were
kidnapped...by the Japanese

737
01:43:55,402 --> 01:43:56,528
Yes

738
01:43:56,612 --> 01:43:57,738
And taken to Manchuria by force?

739
01:43:57,821 --> 01:43:58,989
Yes

740
01:43:59,448 --> 01:44:00,782
Sit down

741
01:44:03,493 --> 01:44:07,497
Do you remember a man called
Reginald Fleming Johnston?

742
01:44:08,707 --> 01:44:10,042
He was your tutor

743
01:44:11,210 --> 01:44:12,252
Yes

744
01:44:13,295 --> 01:44:15,881
And a good friend...I believe

745
01:44:17,633 --> 01:44:20,677
After twenty-eight years in China...

746
01:44:20,844 --> 01:44:22,804
Mr Johnston returned to England

747
01:44:23,514 --> 01:44:29,394
He became a Professor of Oriental
Studies...at London University

748
01:44:30,229 --> 01:44:31,939
And he wrote a book

749
01:44:32,064 --> 01:44:35,817
"It is called "Twilight
in the Forbidden City"

750
01:44:36,026 --> 01:44:38,612
And it is dedicated to you

751
01:44:42,741 --> 01:44:46,119
"Tientsin, 1931"

752
01:45:06,181 --> 01:45:08,267
"I am going to miss you, Johnston"

753
01:45:08,392 --> 01:45:10,394
"I shall miss you, Your Majesty"

754
01:45:14,606 --> 01:45:19,027
Do you think a man...
can become Emperor again?

755
01:45:19,862 --> 01:45:21,989
Yes

756
01:45:39,381 --> 01:45:42,050
"Thank you, Your Majesty"

757
01:45:47,598 --> 01:45:49,641
How can we say goodbye?

758
01:45:51,268 --> 01:45:54,980
As we said hello

759
01:46:05,616 --> 01:46:07,659
"Farewell, Mr Johnston"

760
01:46:08,118 --> 01:46:10,996
"Farewell, Your Majesty"

761
01:46:57,626 --> 01:46:59,503
"Goodbye, Mr Johnston"

762
01:46:59,628 --> 01:47:02,089
"We'll never forget you, Mr Johnston"

763
01:47:02,673 --> 01:47:07,928
"Mr Johnston, goodbye, goodbye"

764
01:47:11,807 --> 01:47:16,478
On page 449...

765
01:47:16,687 --> 01:47:18,981
Mr Johnston writes...

766
01:47:19,106 --> 01:47:24,236
the endeavour to make out that
the Emperor had been kidnapped...

767
01:47:24,486 --> 01:47:26,572
by the Japanese...is wholly untrue

768
01:47:27,573 --> 01:47:31,493
He left Tientsin...he went to
Manchuria of his own free will...

769
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:33,745
Johnston was a liar

770
01:47:34,162 --> 01:47:35,414
What did you say?

771
01:47:35,497 --> 01:47:39,793
Mr Johnston had left before
I was taken to Manchuria

772
01:47:40,377 --> 01:47:43,672
He could not have known what happened

773
01:47:58,854 --> 01:48:00,814
Sit down

774
01:48:07,654 --> 01:48:08,822
According to this account...

775
01:48:08,906 --> 01:48:12,075
you prepared the man's things
on the morning of November 9th

776
01:48:12,242 --> 01:48:15,495
Isn't it unusual for a man who is
kidnapped to have his luggage packed...

777
01:48:15,662 --> 01:48:17,789
by his valet the day before he's kidnapped

778
01:48:18,165 --> 01:48:19,458
This is what you've written isn't it?

779
01:48:19,541 --> 01:48:22,294
Who told you to pack this man's luggage?

780
01:48:25,255 --> 01:48:27,257
These two stories don't fit

781
01:48:27,382 --> 01:48:29,259
Do they?

782
01:48:29,843 --> 01:48:31,970
It was a long time ago

783
01:48:32,513 --> 01:48:34,806
Perhaps I made a mistake

784
01:48:34,932 --> 01:48:36,016
You are lying

785
01:48:36,391 --> 01:48:38,268
You are both lying

786
01:48:38,393 --> 01:48:40,312
Control yourself

787
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:48,570
You can still change your mind

788
01:48:54,076 --> 01:48:58,580
I am the hereditary ruler
of the Manchukuo people

789
01:49:01,124 --> 01:49:04,920
There can be no Manchukuo without me

790
01:49:05,504 --> 01:49:09,216
Do you not see? The Japanese are using you

791
01:49:10,092 --> 01:49:12,469
I must try to use them

792
01:49:12,636 --> 01:49:14,888
The Japanese invasion of Manchuria...

793
01:49:15,013 --> 01:49:16,974
will be condemned by
the League of Nations...

794
01:49:17,099 --> 01:49:19,017
and by every civilised country on Earth

795
01:49:19,142 --> 01:49:22,521
The Chinese Republic has broken
every promise it ever made to me

796
01:49:22,813 --> 01:49:25,941
Chinese troops desecrated
the tombs of my ancestors

797
01:49:26,316 --> 01:49:29,611
And Chinese troops did not
defend Manchuria from the Japanese

798
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:32,030
But Manchuria is still China

799
01:49:32,406 --> 01:49:34,408
China has turned its back on me

800
01:49:34,491 --> 01:49:36,076
Please do not go

801
01:49:36,493 --> 01:49:39,371
Manchuria is the richest frontier in Asia

802
01:49:39,663 --> 01:49:42,040
"Coal, oil, railways"

803
01:49:42,332 --> 01:49:45,711
Millions of Chinese emigrants
are going there every year

804
01:49:46,170 --> 01:49:47,713
I'm going to build my country

805
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:50,340
Johnston was wrong but he wasn't a liar

806
01:49:51,008 --> 01:49:52,926
There was no kidnapping

807
01:49:53,343 --> 01:49:55,637
You went to Manchuria by your own choice

808
01:49:55,762 --> 01:49:57,681
because you wanted to be Emperor again

809
01:50:14,615 --> 01:50:18,285
These might help you to remember the truth

810
01:50:33,675 --> 01:50:37,179
Manchuria 1934

811
01:51:56,425 --> 01:51:58,427
To Heaven

812
01:52:05,475 --> 01:52:07,561
To Earth

813
01:52:08,353 --> 01:52:10,105
To the Moon

814
01:52:12,774 --> 01:52:15,319
To the Sun

815
01:52:32,002 --> 01:52:34,004
You're an Empress again

816
01:52:35,422 --> 01:52:37,591
What I'm going to be is a pilot

817
01:52:38,008 --> 01:52:40,010
I'm going to train at
a secret base near Yokohama

818
01:52:40,135 --> 01:52:41,845
To learn precision bombing

819
01:52:43,639 --> 01:52:46,350
I want to bomb Shanghai

820
01:52:47,184 --> 01:52:48,977
Bomb Shanghai?

821
01:52:49,436 --> 01:52:51,188
I hate China

822
01:52:57,569 --> 01:52:59,988
I hate you

823
01:54:19,693 --> 01:54:21,403
The Japanese Army High Command

824
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:23,739
Very impressive

825
01:54:56,813 --> 01:55:01,235
On behalf of the Emperor of Japan...
the Commander of the Kwangtung Army...

826
01:55:01,485 --> 01:55:07,824
extends his warmest congratulations on
the occasion of His Majesty's coronation

827
01:57:03,482 --> 01:57:08,654
"Ah, may I introduce you...
my wife, the Princess Hiro Saga"

828
01:57:09,112 --> 01:57:12,699
Prime Minister Hsiao-Hsiu

829
01:57:17,079 --> 01:57:20,249
The Honourable Chang Ching-Hui...
Minister of Defense

830
01:57:21,083 --> 01:57:24,294
"The Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Colonna"

831
01:57:39,268 --> 01:57:43,021
The Empress and I accept with great pleasure

832
01:57:49,862 --> 01:57:51,572
"Excuse me, Gentlemen"

833
01:58:14,761 --> 01:58:18,307
"Ah, and our Mr Amakasu..."

834
01:58:18,515 --> 01:58:23,187
is the new chief of the
Manchurian Motion Picture Studios

835
01:58:32,112 --> 01:58:35,073
Do you have to spoil this day?

836
01:58:35,199 --> 01:58:36,533
Why?

837
01:58:38,535 --> 01:58:43,707
Mr Amakasu is the most
powerful man in Manchukuo

838
01:58:43,957 --> 01:58:45,542
What are you talking about?

839
01:58:47,044 --> 01:58:50,923
You did not believe I could
be Emperor again. But I am

840
01:58:51,465 --> 01:58:53,717
You are blind

841
01:59:03,435 --> 01:59:07,189
Do you know what it means to be
an Empress? You are an Empress

842
01:59:11,318 --> 01:59:13,612
Why do you not make love to me anymore?

843
01:59:13,737 --> 01:59:16,240
Because you have become an opium addict

844
01:59:16,615 --> 01:59:18,408
Opium killed my Mother

845
01:59:19,243 --> 01:59:20,744
Opium destroyed China

846
01:59:21,119 --> 01:59:23,163
You can buy opium anywhere in Manchukuo

847
01:59:23,288 --> 01:59:24,248
Shut up

848
01:59:24,331 --> 01:59:25,082
In any shop

849
01:59:25,165 --> 01:59:26,416
Shut up

850
01:59:30,170 --> 01:59:33,257
Your brother is going to have a child

851
01:59:35,425 --> 01:59:38,136
We must have a child

852
01:59:38,637 --> 01:59:41,765
You must have an heir

853
01:59:42,307 --> 01:59:47,104
Emperor Hirohito has officially
invited us to Japan

854
01:59:47,604 --> 01:59:49,398
I am going alone

855
01:59:49,940 --> 01:59:51,900
You are staying here

856
01:59:52,693 --> 01:59:54,319
I would never go to Japan

857
01:59:54,653 --> 01:59:56,572
Then go to your room

858
02:00:03,787 --> 02:00:07,249
Ten thousand years to His Majesty the Emperor

859
02:00:08,584 --> 02:00:34,193
Ten thousand years

860
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:23,450
I told you I hate you

861
02:01:25,994 --> 02:01:29,998
Only because I give you what you need

862
02:02:03,699 --> 02:02:06,118
Now we're engaged

863
02:03:01,507 --> 02:03:03,467
You forgot my toothpowder

864
02:03:04,343 --> 02:03:06,637
"Yes, sir"

865
02:03:25,572 --> 02:03:26,573
Move him

866
02:03:31,662 --> 02:03:34,122
981 . Collect your things

867
02:03:44,007 --> 02:03:45,592
Up stairs

868
02:03:49,930 --> 02:03:51,223
Stop

869
02:03:59,815 --> 02:04:02,609
Your laces are undone. Do them up

870
02:04:02,734 --> 02:04:04,111
Thursday you serve lunch

871
02:04:04,236 --> 02:04:05,946
Friday you clean the toilet

872
02:04:06,071 --> 02:04:08,574
Saturday you sweep the floor

873
02:04:36,226 --> 02:04:38,854
I have never been separated from my family

874
02:04:39,021 --> 02:04:41,023
You'd better get use to it

875
02:04:46,820 --> 02:04:48,697
"You do not remember me, do you?"

876
02:04:49,448 --> 02:04:53,827
I was the Minister of Trade -- in Manchukuo

877
02:04:56,914 --> 02:04:59,124
You were all in Manchukuo

878
02:05:00,375 --> 02:05:02,628
Now I am the Cell Leader

879
02:05:02,753 --> 02:05:04,922
It is important to follow the rules here

880
02:05:05,297 --> 02:05:08,300
No talking during study sessions

881
02:05:30,614 --> 02:05:33,951
MANCHURIA 1935

882
02:06:00,519 --> 02:06:02,312
"Where is your gun, Captain?"

883
02:06:02,688 --> 02:06:04,022
Where are their swords?

884
02:06:04,356 --> 02:06:06,859
"Our weapons have been removed, Your Majesty"

885
02:06:06,984 --> 02:06:09,403
On the orders of Colonel Yoshioka?

886
02:06:09,820 --> 02:06:12,072
Colonel Yoshioka?

887
02:06:13,323 --> 02:06:15,409
Colonel Yoshioka

888
02:06:15,534 --> 02:06:16,743
What has happened here?

889
02:06:17,119 --> 02:06:19,037
Why has my Guard been disarmed?

890
02:06:19,162 --> 02:06:25,127
There have been many changes
while you were in Tokyo

891
02:06:25,419 --> 02:06:28,589
"Your Majesty, may I present
Masaomi Kobayakawa..."

892
02:06:28,755 --> 02:06:32,217
the new Japanese Ambassador...to Manchukuo

893
02:06:58,452 --> 02:07:01,455
Why is Prime Minister Hsiao-Hsiu
not here to receive me?

894
02:07:01,580 --> 02:07:04,374
"The Prime Minister has
resigned, Your Majesty"

895
02:07:04,917 --> 02:07:07,169
His son his been assassinated

896
02:07:07,628 --> 02:07:09,338
Assassinated?

897
02:07:09,463 --> 02:07:13,175
"By Communist bandits, Your Majesty"

898
02:07:19,139 --> 02:07:21,350
I must see him at once

899
02:07:21,475 --> 02:07:24,269
"He refuses to see anyone, Your Majesty"

900
02:07:24,436 --> 02:07:29,483
He has gone to a monastery... far away

901
02:07:36,532 --> 02:07:38,158
Who are you?

902
02:07:38,825 --> 02:07:41,453
"Chang Ching Hui, Your Majesty"

903
02:07:41,578 --> 02:07:44,122
Minister of Defence

904
02:07:52,673 --> 02:07:56,134
"The Council Meeting will be at
four o'clock, Your Majesty..."

905
02:07:56,343 --> 02:07:58,470
before the State dinner

906
02:08:09,147 --> 02:08:13,151
The Emperor has been asked
to sign the following

907
02:08:13,902 --> 02:08:19,575
After careful consideration
we have decided...

908
02:08:19,825 --> 02:08:23,287
to nominate the honourable Chang Ching Hui
as the new Prime Minister of Manchukuo

909
02:08:29,418 --> 02:08:32,546
"Today, on the our return from Japan..."

910
02:08:32,713 --> 02:08:36,091
we wish to speak of
something more important...

911
02:08:36,508 --> 02:08:39,678
the future of our friendship with Japan

912
02:08:40,804 --> 02:08:43,974
This is based on mutual respect...

913
02:08:44,433 --> 02:08:48,478
and respect means equality and independence

914
02:08:48,937 --> 02:08:51,106
When the two Emperors stood together...

915
02:08:51,231 --> 02:08:53,567
and saluted the two national flags

916
02:08:53,692 --> 02:08:56,904
they recognised that
Manchukuo had come of age

917
02:08:57,070 --> 02:09:01,033
"Manchukuo is not a colony,
Manchukuo is Manchuria"

918
02:09:04,494 --> 02:09:06,997
The relationship between
our two countries...

919
02:09:07,164 --> 02:09:10,000
is like the relationship
between its two Emperors

920
02:09:10,375 --> 02:09:15,339
It is rooted in fraternal
trust...in...in the desire

921
02:09:15,589 --> 02:09:18,258
to preserve our ancient traditions...

922
02:09:18,717 --> 02:09:22,429
and in a mutual respect
for national identities

923
02:09:23,805 --> 02:09:27,601
Already we have welcomed the
Ambassadors...of E I Salvador

924
02:09:27,809 --> 02:09:29,895
"Costa Rica, the Vatican"

925
02:09:32,773 --> 02:09:36,985
"Soon, I'm...l'm sure the
other countries will follow"

926
02:09:55,337 --> 02:09:58,006
I am going to have a child

927
02:10:01,969 --> 02:10:05,222
The Father is Manchurian

928
02:10:12,062 --> 02:10:14,982
I did it for you

929
02:10:36,003 --> 02:10:37,713
His Majesty forgot to
sign the appointment of

930
02:10:37,838 --> 02:10:41,341
the new Prime Minister...Mr Chang Ching Hui

931
02:10:43,844 --> 02:10:45,596
I did not forget

932
02:10:51,852 --> 02:10:55,981
"When an Englishman robs someone,
Your Majesty, he becomes a gentleman"

933
02:10:56,481 --> 02:10:59,401
If he robs a lot he becomes a knight

934
02:11:00,194 --> 02:11:04,239
Do you imagine the British run
their empire as a charity?

935
02:11:04,740 --> 02:11:09,161
If India has payed for the
cost of its own occupation...

936
02:11:09,369 --> 02:11:12,414
so must Manchukuo

937
02:11:25,636 --> 02:11:29,890
We hope Manchukuo will have an heir

938
02:11:31,433 --> 02:11:33,560
The Empress is expecting a child

939
02:11:33,936 --> 02:11:37,022
"Yes, Your Majesty...we are
aware of the situation"

940
02:11:43,403 --> 02:11:45,739
This is the name of the
Father. His name is Chang

941
02:11:55,249 --> 02:11:59,711
He is your driver

942
02:12:18,438 --> 02:12:21,108
All the necessary facts have been recorded

943
02:12:21,275 --> 02:12:23,360
The man will be punished

944
02:12:23,944 --> 02:12:27,489
The Emperor cannot allow
his honour to be stained

945
02:12:44,381 --> 02:12:48,552
The Japanese are the only
divine race on our earth

946
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:55,642
"We will take China, Hong Kong...
Indo-China, Siam, Malaya"

947
02:12:55,976 --> 02:12:58,979
Singapore and India

948
02:12:59,146 --> 02:13:02,149
Asia belongs to us

949
02:13:33,096 --> 02:13:36,058
There have been complaints
from your cell mates

950
02:13:36,183 --> 02:13:40,437
You must learn how to urinate at night
without walking them all up

951
02:13:42,439 --> 02:13:44,399
The way to do it...

952
02:13:44,525 --> 02:13:47,402
is to urinate against
the side of the bucket...

953
02:13:47,528 --> 02:13:49,738
not into the middle

954
02:13:49,863 --> 02:13:51,657
"Yes, comrade"

955
02:14:05,754 --> 02:14:09,007
"You still think I'm your servant, don't you?"

956
02:14:31,655 --> 02:14:34,074
You are all pretending

957
02:14:34,199 --> 02:14:36,201
You are just pretending you have changed

958
02:14:36,326 --> 02:14:38,996
The party it teach us to be new men

959
02:14:39,162 --> 02:14:41,123
We are working for a new China

960
02:14:41,415 --> 02:14:43,542
You worked in Amakasu's private office

961
02:14:43,667 --> 02:14:45,252
You are still the same people

962
02:14:45,377 --> 02:14:47,379
People do not change

963
02:14:47,713 --> 02:14:51,383
Guard!

964
02:14:58,098 --> 02:15:04,563
I let it happen

965
02:15:40,307 --> 02:15:42,351
"The second edict, Your Majesty"

966
02:15:42,768 --> 02:15:47,606
Japanese will be the official
language in Manchukuo schools

967
02:15:59,826 --> 02:16:01,370
Your Majesty...

968
02:16:05,958 --> 02:16:08,335
"The baby was born dead, Your Majesty"

969
02:16:08,669 --> 02:16:09,920
How is the Empress?

970
02:16:10,295 --> 02:16:14,341
It would be better if she goes
to a clinic...somewhere warm

971
02:16:16,969 --> 02:16:19,388
"She's already left, Your Majesty"

972
02:17:11,565 --> 02:17:16,361
Open the door

973
02:18:13,460 --> 02:18:16,421
With Manchukuo now firmly in their grasp...

974
02:18:16,588 --> 02:18:19,800
the Japanese soon controlled
most of North China

975
02:18:20,300 --> 02:18:23,595
By 1937 they were ready to strike
South at the heart of the country

976
02:18:23,804 --> 02:18:25,597
The attack on Shanghai
was one of the first...

977
02:18:26,390 --> 02:18:31,353
civilian bombing raids in history

978
02:18:31,937 --> 02:18:34,273
It left thousands homeless

979
02:18:34,398 --> 02:18:36,149
Thousands dead

980
02:18:41,488 --> 02:18:43,490
Three months later Japanese armies...

981
02:18:43,615 --> 02:18:46,785
were besieging the provisional
capital...at Nanking...

982
02:18:47,327 --> 02:18:51,582
and when the city fell
...the atrocities began

983
02:18:52,332 --> 02:18:56,503
Trying to terrorise the rest
of China into surrender

984
02:18:56,712 --> 02:18:59,548
The Japanese high command ordered a massacre

985
02:18:59,715 --> 02:19:05,012
More than two hundred thousand civilians
were systematically executed

986
02:19:05,387 --> 02:19:07,764
The world watched in horror...

987
02:19:07,890 --> 02:19:10,184
but no help was given

988
02:19:10,601 --> 02:19:12,978
On December 7th 1941 ...

989
02:19:13,478 --> 02:19:16,231
Japan attacked the American fleet...

990
02:19:16,356 --> 02:19:17,733
at Pearl Harbour

991
02:19:17,858 --> 02:19:20,235
There was no warning

992
02:19:20,569 --> 02:19:24,364
Manchukuo...the Japanese bustion in North China...

993
02:19:24,531 --> 02:19:29,203
was still ruled by the puppet Emperor Pu Yi

994
02:19:29,745 --> 02:19:32,706
But behind the facade of triumph...

995
02:19:32,873 --> 02:19:35,375
was a country enslaved

996
02:19:36,168 --> 02:19:39,922
A country where Japanese experiments
in biological warfare...

997
02:19:40,088 --> 02:19:44,051
were carried out on live human beings

998
02:19:44,801 --> 02:19:50,557
A country where opium production became
the easiest way to finance the war

999
02:19:51,058 --> 02:19:55,729
Millions of people...were deliberately
turned into drug addicts

1000
02:20:21,380 --> 02:20:25,926
Nine days after the bomb...

1001
02:20:26,134 --> 02:20:28,428
at Hiroshima on August 15th 1945...

1002
02:20:28,554 --> 02:20:32,933
Emperor Hirohito...announced
the surrender of Japan

1003
02:20:33,267 --> 02:20:37,604
It was the first time...his voice
had ever been heard...on radio

1004
02:21:22,357 --> 02:21:24,693
"You must get to Tokoy, Your Majesty"

1005
02:21:24,818 --> 02:21:26,904
You must surrender to the Americans
not the Russians

1006
02:21:27,362 --> 02:21:29,740
The Communists will kill everyone

1007
02:22:15,035 --> 02:22:17,829
The Empress has returned

1008
02:22:26,088 --> 02:22:28,215
"Your Majesty, please"

1009
02:22:32,636 --> 02:22:34,221
Your Majesty

1010
02:23:27,357 --> 02:23:33,405
The women are not in danger. We must hurry

1011
02:24:30,295 --> 02:24:35,843
"Your Majesty, your Majesty is leaving now"

1012
02:25:11,170 --> 02:25:13,380
The Russians

1013
02:25:51,543 --> 02:25:55,339
Perhaps you think we are here
to teach men to lie in a new way?

1014
02:25:55,964 --> 02:25:59,510
Why did you sign every
accusation made against you?

1015
02:25:59,718 --> 02:26:03,096
I didn't stop you from killing
yourself to see you like this

1016
02:26:04,681 --> 02:26:06,433
Someone who signs anything

1017
02:26:06,558 --> 02:26:09,520
to please his enemies...to please me

1018
02:26:09,645 --> 02:26:12,105
You knew about a lot of
things in Manchukuo...

1019
02:26:12,272 --> 02:26:14,233
even the secret agreements

1020
02:26:14,525 --> 02:26:17,361
But you couldn't possibly have known
about the Japanese biological warfare

1021
02:26:17,486 --> 02:26:22,157
experiments in Harbin. Could you?

1022
02:26:23,534 --> 02:26:26,662
So why did you sign these papers?

1023
02:26:31,166 --> 02:26:33,627
I was responsible for everything

1024
02:26:34,044 --> 02:26:37,047
You are responsible for what you do

1025
02:26:37,548 --> 02:26:40,884
All your life you thought you
were better than everyone else

1026
02:26:41,343 --> 02:26:43,929
Now you think you are the worse of all

1027
02:26:49,518 --> 02:26:52,521
Why can you not leave me alone?

1028
02:26:53,564 --> 02:26:56,942
You saved my life...to make me
a puppet in your own play

1029
02:26:59,194 --> 02:27:01,947
You saved me because I am useful to you

1030
02:27:02,281 --> 02:27:06,994
Is that so terrible?

1031
02:27:39,401 --> 02:27:42,279
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi

1032
02:27:46,742 --> 02:27:51,163
By order of the Supreme People's Court...

1033
02:27:51,371 --> 02:27:55,000
the War Criminal Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi...

1034
02:27:55,167 --> 02:27:58,795
"male, fifty-three years old..."

1035
02:27:59,004 --> 02:28:03,550
of the Manchu nationality and from Peking...

1036
02:28:03,759 --> 02:28:07,095
has now served the years detention

1037
02:28:07,763 --> 02:28:11,642
As a result of remoulding through labour...

1038
02:28:12,017 --> 02:28:16,313
and ideological education...

1039
02:28:16,522 --> 02:28:20,317
during his captivity he has shown
that he has genuinely reformed

1040
02:28:20,526 --> 02:28:25,531
In accordance with Clause One
of the Special Pardon Order...

1041
02:28:25,781 --> 02:28:29,535
he is therefore to be released

1042
02:28:41,255 --> 02:28:42,506
You see?

1043
02:28:42,798 --> 02:28:47,219
I will end up living in
prison longer than you

1044
02:31:28,505 --> 02:31:31,008
They are so young

1045
02:31:31,675 --> 02:31:33,760
It is dangerous

1046
02:31:41,059 --> 02:31:43,478
"Pu Chieh, look"

1047
02:31:48,525 --> 02:31:50,569
It is the Governor of our prison

1048
02:31:51,403 --> 02:31:52,529
It cannot be

1049
02:31:52,613 --> 02:31:54,823
"It is, I'm sure it is"

1050
02:31:57,367 --> 02:31:58,827
Be careful

1051
02:32:00,621 --> 02:32:01,997
Come back

1052
02:32:47,084 --> 02:32:50,921
"Comrade. This must be a mistake,
I know this man"

1053
02:32:51,088 --> 02:32:52,381
He is a good man

1054
02:32:52,464 --> 02:32:53,340
Who are you?

1055
02:32:53,715 --> 02:32:55,092
I am a gardener

1056
02:32:55,592 --> 02:32:58,178
"Join us comrade, or fuck off'

1057
02:33:08,814 --> 02:33:10,107
But what has he done?

1058
02:33:10,232 --> 02:33:11,149
He's been accused

1059
02:33:11,233 --> 02:33:12,150
Accused of what?

1060
02:33:12,234 --> 02:33:13,026
Emperor's lackey

1061
02:33:13,068 --> 02:33:14,278
Revisionist element

1062
02:33:14,361 --> 02:33:15,571
Rotten rightest

1063
02:33:16,530 --> 02:33:17,823
Confess your crimes

1064
02:33:17,906 --> 02:33:19,116
I have nothing to confess

1065
02:33:19,575 --> 02:33:21,451
Kowtow to Chairman Mao

1066
02:33:25,664 --> 02:33:26,957
Confess your crimes

1067
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:28,083
I have nothing to confess

1068
02:33:28,417 --> 02:33:29,543
Kowtow

1069
02:33:34,089 --> 02:33:34,923
Confess your crimes

1070
02:33:34,965 --> 02:33:36,175
Wait

1071
02:33:36,258 --> 02:33:38,594
He is a teacher. He is a good teacher

1072
02:33:39,928 --> 02:33:41,263
You cannot do this to him

1073
02:36:47,157 --> 02:36:53,330
Stop. You are not allowed in there

1074
02:36:57,251 --> 02:36:58,085
Who are you?

1075
02:36:58,168 --> 02:36:59,044
I live here

1076
02:36:59,127 --> 02:37:00,546
I am the son of the Guardian

1077
02:37:01,547 --> 02:37:03,799
"Ah. Well, I used to live here too"

1078
02:37:03,966 --> 02:37:05,717
That is where I sat

1079
02:37:05,843 --> 02:37:06,927
Who are you?

1080
02:37:07,845 --> 02:37:10,472
I was the Emperor of China

1081
02:37:10,639 --> 02:37:12,391
Prove it

1082
02:38:52,074 --> 02:38:54,159
This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony...

1083
02:38:54,284 --> 02:38:56,036
where the Emperors were crowned

1084
02:38:56,286 --> 02:38:59,773
The last Emperor to be crowned here
was Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi

1085
02:39:00,108 --> 02:39:02,251
He was three years old

1086
02:39:02,668 --> 02:39:05,796
He died in 1967
