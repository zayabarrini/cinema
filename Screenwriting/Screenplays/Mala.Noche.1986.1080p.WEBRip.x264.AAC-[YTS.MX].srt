1
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:07,866
Working in the store Sunday all day.

2
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:10,130
Can I help you?

3
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:13,655
<i>I want to drink
this Mexican boy, Johnny Alonzo,
from LA near Riverside.</i>

4
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:16,179
<i>He makes my heart throb--</i>

5
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,703
<i>♪ Thumpety bum, bum, bum, bum, bum ♪
when I see him.</i>

6
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,751
<i>He says he's 18,
but he could be 16.</i>

7
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:24,535
Do you want some chips?

8
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:28,539
<i>All I want to do is caress him.
I want to hold him.</i>

9
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:32,239
<i>What's that? He has these hickeys
on his neck.</i>

10
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:34,066
What have you got there?
He likes men.

11
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,418
What's that?
That looks like a hickey.

12
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:41,030
Gonna be your friend.
Su amigo.

13
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:44,251
<i>He's out on the street with friends
staying in a three-dollar-a-night...</i>

14
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:47,036
<i>cheap hotel room on Sixth
off skid road.</i>

15
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:48,690
<i>And he speaks
almost no English.</i>

16
00:02:48,777 --> 00:02:50,735
Hey, tell him I'm not
the Immigration.

17
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:52,737
¿Cómo se llama?

18
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:54,696
Me llamo Johnny Alonzo.

19
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:58,352
And you don't have any place
to stay, do you?

20
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,484
Look here, man.
Let me have a pack of Top, will ya?

21
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,878
That's all I wanna hear.

22
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:04,706
- There you go, huh?
- All right. Thanks a lot.

23
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:05,968
Thanks.

24
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,949
Hey, Johnny.

25
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:33,517
Hola.

26
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,824
¿Qué pasa?

27
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,869
Es muy frío.

28
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:47,357
Come here, you little cutie.

29
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:56,148
You need a place
to stay tonight?

30
00:03:57,367 --> 00:03:59,456
I mean, there's always
my place.

31
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:01,676
Okay?

32
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:04,940
And it's right across
from the YWCA over there.

33
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:06,724
Hey. Wait a minute.
Come back.

34
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:10,206
No way.

35
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,868
I'm in love with this boy.

36
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,261
Really.

37
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:22,958
You are always in love.

38
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:27,310
No. I mean, Sarah,
he just came into the store.

39
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:30,182
I mean, I'm sure
he just got into town.

40
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,794
You see people come
into the store all the time.

41
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,624
Let me invite him
to dinner.

42
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,801
Okay.

43
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:42,151
So where are we gonna
find him?

44
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:44,109
I don't know.
Hmm.

45
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:46,460
The street.

46
00:04:46,547 --> 00:04:48,636
How old is he?

47
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:51,639
He says he's 18, but--Oh.

48
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:53,989
I don't know.
He's probably--

49
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:55,556
Vegetables and rice.

50
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:58,907
Sounds good.

51
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,651
I don't care. Even--

52
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:06,349
Even if it jeopardizes
working at the store,

53
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,788
I have to show him that--
that I'm gay for him.

54
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:14,314
I have to show him
how I feel.

55
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:28,632
What are you doing out here
by yourself, honey?

56
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:30,808
Oh, I-- I'm waiting for
some friends of mine, actually.

57
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:33,158
Oh, okay. You're all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

58
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:39,643
Hello. Hola.

59
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:47,521
You ran out without paying?

60
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:00,664
Are they looking
for you now?

61
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,580
Are they after you?

62
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:18,856
Um, we're gonna be
leaving pretty soon actually.

63
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:20,684
I'm sorry. I didn't know you're--
Are you married?

64
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:23,208
Well, no. It's a--
It's some friends of mine.

65
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:25,515
You know, usually people cook,
you know, they're married.

66
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:28,518
It's kind of dumb.
No. Um, you're gonna get hit, you know.

67
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,477
Oh, God. I've been hit
before, you know.

68
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,877
Hey. What are you doing
under my car?

69
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:41,662
Johnny.

70
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:46,580
No, we'd like to invite you
over-- Excuse me.

71
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,365
We'd like to invite you for dinner.
We're gonna make you some good food.

72
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:50,845
We're hoping to cook him
for dinner tonight.

73
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:52,499
You're gonna cook him
for dinner?

74
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:54,370
Gonna make something
for them to eat actually.

75
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,633
¿Tienes hambre?
Are you hungry?

76
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,418
Come on.

77
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:02,204
Sure. Sure. Come on.

78
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:09,516
Take care, okay?
Okay. You too, lady.

79
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:11,387
Be careful.
Bye-bye.

80
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:20,091
¡Guau!

81
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:24,705
Hey. Hey.
What are you doing?

82
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:28,752
I am gonna be making you some good food.
Where'd you get this stuff at?

83
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,189
No, no. I'm gonna be cooking some vegetables.
Listen to her.

84
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:35,150
All right. All right.
He is a sugar freak.

85
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,155
¿Permiso?

86
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:58,434
Sí.

87
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:20,195
It's okay. Sure. We can go back.
It's all right. Don't freak out.

88
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:22,327
What's the matter?
He wants to go back to the hotel.

89
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:24,504
It's okay. Sí. Es posible.

90
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:27,028
- Okay. I'll take him back. Then we'll--
- Sí. Es posible.

91
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:36,472
Hey.

92
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,833
Sure. Sure. Tell him to come.

93
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,140
Let him get in the front.
Get in the front.

94
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:53,315
There's room up here.

95
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,887
Hola.

96
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:14,031
Un momentito.

97
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:01,252
Shh.

98
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:30,630
What'd he say?

99
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:33,328
Well, he says that when, um,
they first came on the train,

100
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:35,591
they had another friend
with them, and--

101
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:38,115
and the police came--
¿Tres policía?

102
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:40,596
Sí.
There were, like, three police.

103
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:46,210
Jumped him, and they--

104
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:47,951
They hurt their friend.
Killed him?

105
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,571
That's horrible.
I think he, like, killed him.

106
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,443
- What's this--
- The biggest pro--

107
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,576
The biggest problem is you get
too far removed from the death aspect.

108
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,797
It's like you walk into McDonald's,
and they just line the cows up...

109
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:11,061
and they bump 'em all off for you,
and you never have to see it happening.

110
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:14,630
If you had to go out there
and kill every piece of meat that you ate,

111
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:18,678
that's a-- that's a little easier
for me to buy, because you experience the death.

112
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:22,464
You see it happening, and you
realize what you're doing when you eat it.

113
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:25,597
But when you walk into a McDonald's
and say, "Uh, give me a Big Mac,"

114
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,036
you know, you're just getting
dead cow and you never see the cow die.

115
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:30,907
That's--

116
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:32,953
All those poisons release
at the time of death too.

117
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,216
Bad for your karma.

118
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:40,438
So it's not bad to eat food without
meat in it. You know. You can survive.

119
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:03,113
Nice meeting you.
- Adiós.

120
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,073
Gracias. Gracias.
De nada. De nada.

121
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:10,686
<i>We returned downhill
through the tunnel curves fast.</i>

122
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:14,821
<i>Jesus Christ. The boy's insane, like
all Mexicans, about driving fast and crazy.</i>

123
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:18,694
<i>In the front seat next to him
I cover my eyes, tell him to slow down.</i>

124
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,783
<i>It's too late to get control
of the wheel.</i>

125
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,786
<i>The look on his face
is pure ecstasy.</i>

126
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:27,572
<i>The incredible, beautiful, turned-on
face of an ignorant Mexican teenager.</i>

127
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:30,140
<i>His friends laughing
in the backseat,</i>

128
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:33,317
<i>driving a maniacal machine
downhill as fast as he can go.</i>

129
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,062
I'll give you $15
if I can sleep with Johnny.

130
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:41,151
Quince dólares.

131
00:12:41,238 --> 00:12:43,937
¿Sí? Para me and Johnny.

132
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:49,159
Is okay? ¿Bien?

133
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:51,945
Quince dólares.
I wish I had more. I wish I had a hundred.

134
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:56,297
I love you.

135
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:58,299
Come on.

136
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:00,214
Ask him.

137
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:02,346
Mm-mmm.

138
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:05,262
I'd give you 50 if I had it,
but I only have 15.

139
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:08,091
Quince dólares para tú.

140
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:12,052
Fifteen dollars?

141
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:17,100
Come on. Angel face.

142
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,459
- I want to sleep with him.
- Okay, vamos.

143
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:57,532
Where the hell do you
think you're goin'?

144
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,969
Upstairs.
No visitors.

145
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:01,928
No, we're not visitors.
Uh, I'm with him.

146
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:04,365
We're going upstairs.
Got a key?

147
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:08,064
The key.

148
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:10,588
Doesn't have it.
No visitors.

149
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:13,026
Oh, come on. We're going upstairs.
You're not going anywhere.

150
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:15,028
He lives here.
Where's his key?

151
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:17,073
Get out of here.
We're going upstairs.

152
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,683
No, you're not
going anywhere.

153
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,424
Open the door.
No.

154
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:22,949
Come on. Just open the door.
Get out.

155
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:25,777
What's it gonna hurt you? Just open the door.
Get out. Get out.

156
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,563
Bitch!

157
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,608
You fat cow!

158
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:32,828
Shit!

159
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,786
Damn slut!

160
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,963
Fat cow!

161
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:43,012
What are you gonna do?
You're locked out too.

162
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:45,145
You want to stay
at my place?

163
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:47,625
You can stay there.
It's better than out here.

164
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:50,324
Okay?

165
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,239
Fuckin' bitch!

166
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:12,128
I have to go
work for about an hour.
I'll be right back.

167
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:16,306
Make yourself at home.

168
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:43,948
Más lento. Más lento.

169
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:45,907
Slow down.

170
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:34,102
<i>He said he needed to
tomar agua-- get some water.</i>

171
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:37,975
<i>Is that when he slips the
$10 bill from my pants, or did I lose it?</i>

172
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:39,629
<i>I think he got it.</i>

173
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:53,469
<i>They need money-- Johnny and him.
I hope they got it.</i>

174
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:57,560
<i>Though I was upset that I'd
been fucked, violated and lost the money too,</i>

175
00:20:57,647 --> 00:20:59,954
<i>for a few moments,
thinking about it, in the morning...</i>

176
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:04,698
<i>of the Mexicans gloating over having
fucked the gringoputo and got his money too,</i>

177
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:08,179
<i>talking about it and laughing,
my ass sore.</i>

178
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:12,140
<i>And the more I think about it,
the more I know I asked for a reckless evening.</i>

179
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:19,669
<i>Johnny'll probably never
look at me or talk to me as a friend.</i>

180
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:22,759
<i>He probably wouldn't have
in the first place. I had to find out--</i>

181
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:25,022
<i>to get as close to him
as I could,</i>

182
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:27,068
<i>even if it turned into
a shit-bad night.</i>

183
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:29,940
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

184
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:31,725
All right.
What can I get ya?

185
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:33,422
Oh, we need a fifth
of Night Train.

186
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:35,642
Fifth of Night Train.
Yeah.

187
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:38,035
<i>He said he was gonna
return to LA in 15 days,</i>

188
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:40,255
<i>as soon as he got
traveling money together.</i>

189
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,953
<i>He lives with nine
or 10 brothers.</i>

190
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,522
<i>Maybe when they're making love
they can think about Roberto
having fucked me.</i>

191
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,612
<i>Roberto's cock fucks Johnny
fucked me.</i>

192
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:52,267
<i>That's about as close to Johnny
as I'll ever get.</i>

193
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,965
<i>Unless I had the money.
Poor boys never win.</i>

194
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:59,318
Who fucks whom?
Mala noche.

195
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,842
Every street Mexican on Sixth
will think he can
stick it in me.

196
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:03,757
Well, they're wrong.

197
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:06,281
But they never were too smart
to begin with,
or they wouldn't be here.

198
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:10,764
Chíngalo. My ass is sore.

199
00:22:10,851 --> 00:22:14,028
It's true.
I think he tried to use his cock
like a weapon on me,

200
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:16,509
macho fucking prick.

201
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:41,795
Johnny comes
into the store often.

202
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:49,498
An acquaintance of mine
brought a camera
into the store the other day,

203
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:51,587
and I gave him $10 for it.

204
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:53,589
We decided to go out
and see if it worked.

205
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:55,678
It does!
Hey!

206
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:00,988
Pepper talks to a dog
we find on the street,

207
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:03,251
and I say,
"You lead a dog's life."

208
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:06,123
I don't think he understands.

209
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:12,216
Johnny doesn't want--
doesn't want to be
in our movie.

210
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:14,741
And tells me Roberto wants
to learn to drive the car.

211
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,837
Tell me.
Randy. Is that your name?

212
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:27,014
- No, no. My name's Walt.
- Walt. All right, Walt.

213
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:29,669
- Okay, Walt. I'm Dieter.
- Yeah.

214
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:32,628
This is my cousin Franz.
Ah. Good to meet you, Franz.

215
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,943
We went through
the Second World War.

216
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,685
Yeah, can I have
some Night Train?

217
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:49,297
Right where his daddy was born.
Buck and a half.

218
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:35,474
Hola.
What happened with the police?

219
00:24:41,392 --> 00:24:43,786
Are they after you, or--

220
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:46,963
Can I get you something?
¿Tienes hambre?

221
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:51,446
Cuidado.

222
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:55,798
Veinticinco.

223
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:57,887
Para tú, nada.

224
00:24:57,974 --> 00:25:00,237
¿Y eso por qué? Cuidado.

225
00:25:00,324 --> 00:25:01,717
Un momentito.

226
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:03,502
Hey!

227
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:10,334
Hasta luego.

228
00:25:15,122 --> 00:25:17,472
Shut up.
Hey. Little brother.

229
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:21,432
Come here.
Me speak a little English.

230
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:36,796
"A circuit court jury
in Portland unanimously
convicted...

231
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:41,017
22-year-old
Armando Zamora Flores,

232
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:43,280
a transient, of murder
and first-degree robbery...

233
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:47,023
in the slaying
of William Somerset, 53."

234
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,463
Night--
"1543 Bidwell Street."

235
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,683
Hey, hey, hey.

236
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:59,296
Look. "Flores, through a
Spanish-speaking interpreter"--

237
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:02,343
"maintained that they thought
they were going to another
tavern,

238
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,258
but went instead
to Somerset's house."

239
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:06,826
Hey, hey.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

240
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:09,655
"He said there a man made
homosexual advances
towards him,

241
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:12,875
and when he refused,
came at him with a knife.

242
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:15,356
They struggled, and Flores said
he stabbed Somerset."

243
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:17,227
Friend of yours?

244
00:26:17,314 --> 00:26:20,666
You see how sad that is?

245
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:23,146
Nope.

246
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:25,018
Vámonos.
You know any--

247
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:45,255
Great. You got a gun, huh?

248
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:48,258
You can't just
carry it around like that.
What are you trying to prove?

249
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:52,741
You're gonna shoot
your balls off with it.

250
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:57,137
What are you gonna do
if somebody pulls a gun on you,
and you have to use it?

251
00:26:57,224 --> 00:26:59,705
Look.
Don't point that thing.
It's not a toy.

252
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,489
Take it out of here.

253
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:03,273
Man.

254
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,755
Get it out of the store.
You're just gonna
get in trouble.

255
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:09,149
Take the pie. Vamoose.

256
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:10,324
Take it and go.

257
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,637
Roberto never acknowledges
the fuck of the night before.

258
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,900
It's as though
it never happened.

259
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:22,902
Johnny has
two tiny pimples--

260
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:25,905
zits from bad food on his chin.

261
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:27,950
And he looks sleepy
all the time.

262
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:40,327
Look, driving's not a game for kids.
All right? It's serious.

263
00:28:41,894 --> 00:28:43,765
Johnny!

264
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:46,637
No!

265
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,031
¡Juanito!

266
00:28:49,118 --> 00:28:50,685
¡Muchachos!

267
00:28:54,689 --> 00:28:57,474
The police are gonna pick us up.

268
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:59,259
¡Muchacho!

269
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:04,090
Pull over right now.
I'm gonna drive.

270
00:29:25,328 --> 00:29:28,331
You can drive later.
I just don't want you
to kill me.

271
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,259
We can't stay here forever.
Get in the car.

272
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:52,703
Get back in the car.

273
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:04,775
We're heading west
towards the Pacific Ocean.

274
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,953
Johnny will never, never
go anywhere with me alone.

275
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,651
I find that sad and absurd.

276
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:14,394
But it's part of the game
that he and I play
in having a relationship at all.

277
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:16,352
I don't take it personally.

278
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:19,181
He feels more comfortable
surrounded by his friends.

279
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:36,633
I don't want to interfere
with their lives.

280
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,593
If these two friends are happy,
that's the way it should be.

281
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,857
A gringo like me
has an easy life--
a privileged life--

282
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:45,338
and just because
I see someone attractive
like Johnny...

283
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:47,993
doesn't mean I should be able
to have him,

284
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,865
to buy him or whatever,
just because he's hungry
and on the street,

285
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:53,389
desperate, good-looking.

286
00:31:53,476 --> 00:31:57,567
That wasn't my intention
exactly, but it could be
misunderstood that way.

287
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:01,267
Get back here!

288
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:20,373
Cough 'em up,
you little niño.

289
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,637
Muchacho.

290
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:25,813
Give me the keys,
you little shit!

291
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,393
Open the door! Open the--
Open the door.

292
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,831
Open it.
Where you goin'? Sto--

293
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:48,923
What are you doing?

294
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:04,721
Oh, great.

295
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:29,154
Look. Open the door.
Open it up.

296
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:32,896
Open the fucking--
Stop the car!
Bring it back here!

297
00:35:58,025 --> 00:36:00,070
The drink's--

298
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,769
That's for credit.
No credit. I'm sorry, buddy.

299
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:07,165
It's 3.69. You got cash,
I'll sell it to you.
No credit.

300
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:10,472
Credit's like sex.
Some get it, some don't.
Sorry, buddy.

301
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:38,631
The plan is simple.

302
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:40,459
I go to his room at midnight.

303
00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:51,209
He opens the door,
sees that I want him
that badly--

304
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:04,439
I lay down at his feet
like a dog.

305
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:06,963
Or rather, at the feet
of Roberto and him and--

306
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,756
And after an hour or so,
when none of us knows
what to do any longer,

307
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:18,932
I get up and I leave.

308
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:23,632
My point is being made,
that I want to see him badly,
right?

309
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:26,026
That must mean something.
How many gringos...

310
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:28,376
have acted that dramatically
toward him ever?

311
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:32,467
And whether or not he could
respond in any meaningful way
doesn't matter.

312
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:35,122
He would think of it
as a dramatic macho act.

313
00:39:39,072 --> 00:39:42,336
Oh, shit. Shh.

314
00:40:02,661 --> 00:40:05,838
No. Look, no-- I'm not--
I'm not Immigration.

315
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:08,536
Yo no migras.

316
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:13,062
Qué--No. N-No. No-- Shh!
No, wait. Wait.

317
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:18,154
It's okay.
I'm not the Immigration.
All right?

318
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:20,418
It's a mistake.
Shh! No! W--

319
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:32,342
What the hell are you
doin' out there?

320
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,389
Look, I'm just looking for some
--Get off of there!

321
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:38,000
I was looking for some friends of mine.
Get off of there!

322
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:41,395
I got the wrong apartment. It's a mista--
Don't you remember me from the store?

323
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:43,876
Goddamn sleazeball.

324
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:45,965
Get out of here! Get!

325
00:40:46,052 --> 00:40:49,403
Okay, I'm leaving.
I'm going, all right?

326
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,449
It was a mistake.
I'm sorry.

327
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:55,496
J-Just--

328
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:01,110
Damn!

329
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:06,812
I think there was one kid.
He moved out this morning.

330
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:09,641
Do they
know that I'm here because
I'm in love with the boy?

331
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:12,600
Why would a gringo be here?
Who would he be looking for?

332
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:15,298
A junk dealer?

333
00:41:15,385 --> 00:41:17,431
A whore? A queer?

334
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:19,738
Well, at least I tried.

335
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:29,617
Excuse me. Have you
seen a guy come in here,
a Mexican kid?

336
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:34,448
He's about this tall, he's got
long hair, he's wearing a--
a jean jacket and jeans...

337
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:38,017
and, like, a plaid shirt,
and he's got boots--

338
00:41:40,236 --> 00:41:43,544
I seen a lot of--
a lot of Mexicans
coming in here.

339
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:09,918
It's, like, Saturday and Sunday
we were so close,

340
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:12,442
and then, phfft--
it's all over.

341
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:17,839
I really thought
he was starting to like me.

342
00:42:20,363 --> 00:42:23,453
But I guess not.
Just another fantasy.

343
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:30,460
Or maybe we can only communicate
to a certain point.

344
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,289
I've always had
that problem with you.

345
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:37,467
I go to the Grecian Gardens
raving, "Johnny's gone."

346
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,905
I have a couple of beers
and tell my old buddy George...

347
00:42:39,992 --> 00:42:41,646
about the impossibilities
of love.

348
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:47,260
So, is he gonna come back
and get you, or what?

349
00:42:49,044 --> 00:42:51,133
No sé.

350
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,614
Where did they go? Thanks.

351
00:42:56,095 --> 00:42:58,706
What do you need? No sé.
Maybe Idaho.

352
00:42:58,793 --> 00:43:02,623
Um, get me a big bottle
of Night Train.

353
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:05,191
All right. A big one.
And a pack of Pall Malls.

354
00:43:05,278 --> 00:43:08,890
$2.60-- Buck and a quarter.

355
00:43:08,977 --> 00:43:13,808
Well, I can't believe that they
just took off and left you here.

356
00:43:13,895 --> 00:43:16,681
You sure he's coming back?
What do you need?

357
00:43:16,768 --> 00:43:20,380
Hey, you can't bring
that cart in here!
Take that out. Take that out!

358
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:22,600
- I'll take it out.
- Yeah, right.

359
00:43:26,386 --> 00:43:28,954
Yeah?
Yeah.

360
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:32,871
It's worth about two bucks.
I don't--
I can't use it, though.

361
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:35,569
Yeah. Veinticinco.
Veinticinco.

362
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:39,007
Right. That's the price tag.
That's what people pay
in the store for it.

363
00:43:39,094 --> 00:43:42,054
But it's worthless
unless you want
a pot like this.

364
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:44,578
Por tú, quince pesos.

365
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:48,713
But it's not worth anything
unless you happen to want
a pot like this,

366
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,889
and then you go into
the store and get it.

367
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:54,327
I can't do anything
with it.

368
00:43:54,414 --> 00:43:57,025
Don't you have
a place to stay?

369
00:43:57,112 --> 00:43:59,245
No.

370
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:01,595
You're welcome
to stay at my place.

371
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:07,296
No sé eso.
No, no, it, um-- We'll have a beer.

372
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:09,647
This is my amigo--
my friend Pepper.

373
00:44:09,734 --> 00:44:11,692
¿Habla español?

374
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:14,956
Okay, Pepper, this is--
this is Esther,
and this is Mike.

375
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:16,828
Hi. Mucho gusto.

376
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:20,048
This is Frank
the homophobe here.

377
00:44:20,135 --> 00:44:24,183
That's Henry,
Hannah Duncan, Betty,

378
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:27,882
Don Chambers--
the incredible
Mr. Don Chambers--

379
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:31,843
Yeah. This is Sharon,
and this is Marty.

380
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,583
Marty the poet.

381
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,237
Marty the poet
extraordinaire.
Right?

382
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:37,326
You're never
gonna remember that.

383
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:40,286
How can you remember
one name to 40 names, huh?

384
00:44:40,373 --> 00:44:42,070
The deal with Marty is--

385
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:49,425
¿Qué es tu problema?

386
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,174
Tú es muy serio.

387
00:44:59,261 --> 00:45:01,960
¿Preocupado?

388
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:05,224
¿Qué es tu problema?
No problema.

389
00:45:40,346 --> 00:45:42,348
So-- ¿Qué tal?

390
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:46,961
No.

391
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:48,920
I'm off.

392
00:45:53,315 --> 00:45:54,708
Hasta luego.

393
00:45:58,712 --> 00:46:02,194
Hasta luego.

394
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:04,762
Fuck it.
Do I need him that badly?
Am I that desperate?

395
00:46:07,286 --> 00:46:08,766
Of course I am.

396
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:31,876
Okay, you wanna pick up
a couple extra dollars?

397
00:46:31,963 --> 00:46:35,531
You go up
to this club, okay?
It's up on Fifth Street.

398
00:46:35,618 --> 00:46:39,100
You go up there, be nice
to the guys, they'll pay you
a little bit. All right?

399
00:46:39,187 --> 00:46:41,450
Okay? Got that?

400
00:46:41,537 --> 00:46:44,802
If that don't work out for you,
you go up to another club
up on Sixth Street.

401
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:47,892
Just about a block up.
Go down about a half
a block, okay?

402
00:46:47,979 --> 00:46:52,026
Do some nude dancing, maybe,
pick up a couple extra
dollars, no problem there.

403
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:55,247
If nothing like that works out
for you, go talk to a guy
named Bill. Okay?

404
00:46:55,334 --> 00:46:58,467
He'll take care of you.
Just be nice to him.

405
00:46:58,554 --> 00:47:02,210
He'll do everything for you.
All right? That's all you
gotta do. You got that?

406
00:47:02,297 --> 00:47:05,518
You understand
what I'm saying?
Okay.

407
00:47:05,605 --> 00:47:09,870
A poor Mexican
has a snowball's chance
in hell, man.

408
00:47:09,957 --> 00:47:13,308
It's because disaster
is right around that corner.

409
00:47:13,395 --> 00:47:15,876
Hope Johnny comes back.

410
00:47:17,138 --> 00:47:20,576
Look, take care
of yourself, man.

411
00:47:20,663 --> 00:47:24,624
Come by the store
and I'll give you some
cough medicine, all right?

412
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:27,714
Look, I wanna be
your friend,
your amigo.

413
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:30,064
I'll help you
any way I can.

414
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,241
Wait a minute.

415
00:47:36,114 --> 00:47:38,029
Take care of yourself,
all right?

416
00:47:39,247 --> 00:47:41,554
Gracias. Hasta luego.

417
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:05,665
What do you want?

418
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:08,668
What?

419
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:12,063
Look, Juan,
we can't go driving now.

420
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,326
Later. Después.

421
00:48:14,413 --> 00:48:17,546
Is Johnny back?

422
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:21,507
Shit.

423
00:48:30,168 --> 00:48:31,996
Hola.

424
00:48:40,874 --> 00:48:42,832
Hi.

425
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,010
♪ Adiós, adiós ♪

426
00:49:33,492 --> 00:49:36,277
Everything comes out beautifully
with Spray 'n' Starch.

427
00:49:47,941 --> 00:49:49,899
Hey.

428
00:51:31,871 --> 00:51:35,179
Pizza, taco, burrito.

429
00:51:37,355 --> 00:51:41,185
Comida-- ¿Cómo se llama--

430
00:51:41,272 --> 00:51:43,100
Mil-- Milk shake.

431
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:46,233
¡Ándale!

432
00:52:09,604 --> 00:52:11,998
Hello!

433
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:14,043
Hello?

434
00:52:31,278 --> 00:52:32,279
Howdy.

435
00:52:34,803 --> 00:52:38,155
My friend's looking
for work. Do you know
if there's any work?

436
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:43,464
I remember your friend
from last year.
He's a good worker.

437
00:52:43,551 --> 00:52:47,207
But you guys came
at the wrong time of the year.
It's the wrong season.

438
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:50,993
And I'm not really
the guy to talk to.

439
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,258
We don't really have
a lot of work right now.

440
00:53:17,063 --> 00:53:19,587
¿Dónde vas?

441
00:54:03,718 --> 00:54:05,503
What are you doing?

442
00:54:07,156 --> 00:54:09,681
What's that stuff?

443
00:54:09,768 --> 00:54:12,336
What is that? Es por granos.

444
00:54:12,423 --> 00:54:14,903
Granos.

445
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:19,212
¿Qué es tu problema?

446
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:21,345
Granos. Granos.

447
00:54:21,432 --> 00:54:23,521
¿Granos? No me molesto.

448
00:54:23,608 --> 00:54:26,219
¿En su boca? ¡Por favor, no me molesto!
Para.

449
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:30,136
Pobrecito.

450
00:54:30,223 --> 00:54:32,747
¿Me lo hago? ¡Para!

451
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,578
Come on. Oh.

452
00:54:39,101 --> 00:54:41,495
Para, para. No me molesto.

453
00:54:41,582 --> 00:54:43,541
Hey!

454
00:54:55,596 --> 00:54:57,424
¡No más! ¡Para!

455
00:54:57,511 --> 00:54:59,078
Pendejo.
H-Hold--

456
00:55:00,558 --> 00:55:03,387
¡No más! ¡No más! Pendejo.

457
00:55:13,658 --> 00:55:15,486
All right, stop!

458
00:55:17,096 --> 00:55:19,359
Stop! Hey!

459
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:22,275
Look! Wait!
Look, all r--

460
00:55:23,581 --> 00:55:26,714
Hey! Alto.

461
00:55:29,456 --> 00:55:31,415
Go.

462
00:55:31,502 --> 00:55:33,417
Puto.

463
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:40,380
Tú eres un pendejo.

464
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:44,166
He only wants to have sex
at night, not during the day.

465
00:55:44,253 --> 00:55:48,475
And certain aggressive acts--
that's what he wants and needs.

466
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:50,999
That's not what I want.

467
00:55:51,086 --> 00:55:54,133
I mean, I'm not an invert.

468
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:58,703
His sexual desires
are very stereotypical,
and mine aren't.

469
00:56:00,226 --> 00:56:02,315
These buggers.
Little varmints.

470
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:04,404
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

471
00:57:03,158 --> 00:57:05,596
I love the countryside here.

472
00:57:05,683 --> 00:57:09,295
This is great.
You're doing good.
You're doing real good.

473
00:57:09,382 --> 00:57:13,691
This is your first curve
coming up right up here.

474
00:57:13,778 --> 00:57:15,562
It's your first one.
Do you see it?

475
00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:20,175
Now, all you're gonna want
to do is turn to the left.

476
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:23,222
It's real easy.
All right, get ready.
See it there?

477
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:26,051
Okay, turn-- Turn-- No, turn--

478
00:57:26,138 --> 00:57:29,358
Turn the car! Turn--
What are you doing?
Turn the car!

479
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:33,232
Why would-- Look!

480
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:38,759
What? All you had to do
was turn the car!

481
00:57:38,846 --> 00:57:40,718
What did you do?

482
00:57:41,936 --> 00:57:44,983
Shit! You drive
like you fuck!

483
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:49,204
Get--

484
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:51,511
How--

485
00:57:51,598 --> 00:57:55,646
It's a simple little thing.
All you had to do
was turn the car.

486
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:17,537
Thanks a lot.

487
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:23,587
For $300, the Ebony store
gift certificate.

488
00:58:23,674 --> 00:58:25,676
Okay, that is-- What?
That is 401.

489
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:32,334
I can't help feeling
that his well-being...

490
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:34,336
depends on Johnny coming back.

491
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:38,210
I know he accepts me
and that we're friends, but...

492
00:58:38,297 --> 00:58:40,517
Johnny may have been arrested.

493
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:43,694
He says one of their friends
told him that he saw him
in the back of a police car.

494
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:46,087
So, your grandfather
sent you out for milk?

495
00:58:48,873 --> 00:58:50,831
Es pepino.

496
00:58:50,918 --> 00:58:53,138
That's a cucumber.

497
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:55,314
Cucumber. Cucumber.

498
00:58:55,401 --> 00:58:57,229
Cu... cum-- cumber?

499
00:58:57,316 --> 00:58:59,536
They make pickles
out of 'em.

500
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:01,755
Leche.
Mm-hmm.

501
00:59:02,974 --> 00:59:05,411
Huevos.

502
00:59:05,498 --> 00:59:07,544
Huevos.
Right.

503
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,983
We're gonna have some beans.

504
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:14,289
No sé ése. No sé ése.

505
00:59:14,376 --> 00:59:16,553
Garbanzo beans. Sí.

506
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,860
Shall we put 'em in the--
in the tortilla?

507
00:59:19,947 --> 00:59:22,646
Tortillas aquí. Tortillas aquí. Sí.

508
00:59:25,344 --> 00:59:27,346
Manteca.

509
00:59:31,263 --> 00:59:33,395
Butter. Margarine.

510
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:35,484
It's not margarine. It's shit.

511
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,270
And Pepper
has girlfriends too.

512
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:41,534
I don't think
he likes me that much.

513
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:43,275
I don't blame him.

514
00:59:43,362 --> 00:59:44,929
We're just not compatible.

515
00:59:52,632 --> 00:59:55,069
But why isn't it easy
for them?

516
00:59:55,156 --> 00:59:57,071
I mean,

517
01:00:00,205 --> 01:00:03,425
they don't have
any imagination about sex
or anything else,

518
01:00:03,512 --> 01:00:06,037
like fantasies
or erotic friendship.

519
01:00:06,124 --> 01:00:08,648
Friendship?

520
01:00:08,735 --> 01:00:10,824
I guess
it's not their fault.

521
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:18,702
Let me in. Let me in.

522
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:21,661
Who is it?
It's me, Polly. Let me in.

523
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:24,621
What do you want now?
There's a guy-- There's a weird guy upstairs.

524
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,666
H-He followed me in.

525
01:00:26,753 --> 01:00:28,842
Wh-What guy?
Did you look?

526
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:31,976
There is a guy
who makes Son of Sam
look like Tweety Bird.

527
01:00:32,063 --> 01:00:34,065
We've gotta call the cops.

528
01:00:34,152 --> 01:00:36,676
He's a derelict, man.
We gotta call the cops.

529
01:00:36,763 --> 01:00:39,548
All right, I'll call the cops.
But, look, you handle it.

530
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,681
Okay. I will. You talk to 'em.

531
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:44,118
I don't want anything to do with this.
All right, all right.

532
01:00:44,205 --> 01:00:46,773
Hey! Let me in.
Wait a minute.

533
01:00:53,432 --> 01:00:56,391
Oh, I like it!

534
01:00:56,478 --> 01:00:58,742
You must love that flavor. I've never had that.

535
01:02:57,686 --> 01:02:59,993
Officer 2, where is the Code 5?

536
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,474
Barney's, 14th and Davis.

537
01:03:02,561 --> 01:03:05,346
14th and Division? Davis.

538
01:03:08,175 --> 01:03:11,091
Horton, are you there?

539
01:03:14,181 --> 01:03:16,270
We'll be out talking to him.

540
01:03:43,776 --> 01:03:46,561
Freeze, or you're wallpaper!

541
01:04:20,204 --> 01:04:22,859
Second man down.

542
01:04:22,946 --> 01:04:25,644
He'll be
on the northeast corner.

543
01:04:29,691 --> 01:04:33,478
That's a man down.
He's on the northeast corner--

544
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:43,618
They're people like we are.

545
01:04:43,705 --> 01:04:45,969
I found out they call him Papas,
not Pepper,

546
01:04:46,056 --> 01:04:49,276
because he likes to eat
papas-- or french fries.

547
01:04:49,363 --> 01:04:52,976
El Loco Papas
is smart like a fox,
staying off by himself,

548
01:04:53,063 --> 01:04:54,803
but they got him anyway.

549
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,631
These kids shouldn't be
out on the street, man.

550
01:04:56,718 --> 01:04:58,590
They get into trouble
that way, man.

551
01:04:58,677 --> 01:05:01,767
Dealing marijuana--
The cops are gonna get him,
man. You know that.

552
01:05:01,854 --> 01:05:04,857
Jesus Christ.
It ain't fair, but--

553
01:06:08,573 --> 01:06:11,358
Hello, everybody,
goddamn it.

554
01:06:11,445 --> 01:06:14,492
Señor.

555
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:17,234
Amigo-- Mexico.

556
01:06:17,321 --> 01:06:21,629
I'm gonna have to boot
your ass out of here pretty soon
if you don't mellow out.

557
01:06:21,716 --> 01:06:23,980
Go ahead. Make me go--

558
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:26,330
Watch out.

559
01:06:26,417 --> 01:06:28,332
Sorry.
All right.

560
01:06:28,419 --> 01:06:31,378
Love a--Love a duck.

561
01:06:31,465 --> 01:06:33,772
You see?

562
01:06:39,256 --> 01:06:43,303
So, what I told him was
the story about the lady
with one in her bedside stand.

563
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:46,263
I said, "What the fuck is that?"
And she said,
"That's for burglars."

564
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:49,135
And I said, "You will not
blow a burglar away with that.

565
01:06:49,222 --> 01:06:51,616
You'll blow him
into little pieces."

566
01:06:51,703 --> 01:06:54,097
And she said,
"That's what it's for, George."

567
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,642
Okay, great.

568
01:07:25,345 --> 01:07:27,304
Everybody knows that?

569
01:07:32,744 --> 01:07:35,573
Looking for Johnny,
I saw no sign.

570
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:39,968
I think they got you too.
You have no place
to go or to hide.

571
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:43,276
I don't know
what's gonna happen to you.

572
01:07:43,363 --> 01:07:47,802
Or, Ido know
what's gonna happen to you,
and so do you, probably.

573
01:07:47,889 --> 01:07:50,979
And that's why
I fell in love with Johnny
in the first place.

574
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:54,200
And that's why Roberto was
silent most of the time
and chased white butt--

575
01:07:54,287 --> 01:07:56,594
if you know what I mean--

576
01:07:56,681 --> 01:08:01,120
hoping some of that sticky
good comfort, luck and security
might rub off on him.

577
01:08:01,207 --> 01:08:03,427
Or at least he could
make it squeal.

578
01:08:38,026 --> 01:08:39,898
Are you all right?

579
01:08:42,335 --> 01:08:43,989
Hey!

580
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,905
Are you all right?

581
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:50,387
Man, don't be afraid.
I'm your friend.

582
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,524
Hey, assholes!
Shut the fuck up down there!
I'm tryin' to get some sleep!

583
01:08:57,611 --> 01:09:01,049
Give me a break!
I gotta work for a living, huh?

584
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,008
- Damn!
- Johnny!

585
01:09:41,307 --> 01:09:43,614
Hey! Johnny!

586
01:09:48,532 --> 01:09:51,839
Hey! What happened to you?

587
01:09:51,926 --> 01:09:54,538
They didn't get you.

588
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:57,105
Were you in Idaho?

589
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,977
Shit!

590
01:10:08,726 --> 01:10:11,381
So, come on.
Tell me what happened.

591
01:10:19,606 --> 01:10:24,307
All this time we think
Johnny's on vacation in Idaho.

592
01:10:24,394 --> 01:10:26,613
Well, it seems that
the Immigration picked him up,

593
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:29,007
they captured him, and they
shipped him back to the border,

594
01:10:29,094 --> 01:10:31,227
not to Idaho.

595
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:34,969
Swimming the Rio Grande
by moonlight, he's back
in less than two weeks.

596
01:10:35,056 --> 01:10:37,842
He rode the rails,
hopped the freights.

597
01:10:43,195 --> 01:10:45,502
¡Toro! ¡Toro, muchacho!

598
01:10:45,589 --> 01:10:48,461
¡Olé! ¡Olé!

599
01:10:51,638 --> 01:10:54,293
¡Toro! ¡Toro!

600
01:10:56,426 --> 01:10:57,644
Whoa!

601
01:11:34,246 --> 01:11:36,117
The police came.

602
01:11:39,817 --> 01:11:41,819
I told you
to get rid of that gun.

603
01:12:32,435 --> 01:12:34,611
How you doing?

604
01:12:45,752 --> 01:12:48,451
Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you.

605
01:12:49,713 --> 01:12:52,803
Hey!

606
01:13:38,457 --> 01:13:40,894
I'm thinking of leaving
for Anchorage tomorrow.

607
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:43,506
What's in Anchorage?

608
01:13:43,593 --> 01:13:47,292
I can do nude dancing
in just about any bar in town
and make 150 bucks a night.

609
01:13:47,379 --> 01:13:50,600
Why do you wanna do--
Look!

610
01:13:50,687 --> 01:13:52,428
I can't believe he's there.

611
01:13:53,646 --> 01:13:56,083
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

612
01:13:56,170 --> 01:14:00,566
Hey, come down to the store
and see me sometime.
All right?

613
01:14:00,653 --> 01:14:04,178
Come-- Come down to the store
