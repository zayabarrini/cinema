1
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:41,075
- Can't you be quiet?
- We're having fun.

2
00:01:41,326 --> 00:01:43,450
lf you don't like it, go back to sleep.

3
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:53,784
Mama.

4
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,784
Looks nice. Try the other one too.

5
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,368
This one.

6
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,534
Put it on.

7
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:08,409
Turn to me.

8
00:02:10,536 --> 00:02:11,785
That looks good.

9
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:40,911
Moussa.

10
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,578
Moussa, hurry up. lt's time to go.

11
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:47,786
Move it, now！

12
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:53,453
You look beautiful.

13
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:55,286
Gorgeous.

14
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:01,371
Give it back!

15
00:03:16,622 --> 00:03:18,162
Seydoul Seydou!

16
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:19,787
Hey, Seydou!

17
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:23,204
- What is it, mum?
- Where are you going?

18
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:25,955
- Going to play football.
- What about the Sabar?

19
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,913
- I told you I had a match.
- I'll come after.

20
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,788
Don't be late.
Okay.

21
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,497
Better not be late!
Don't worry.

22
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,332
Stop counting!

23
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,165
You've seen how much we have?

24
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,832
You count it every time!

25
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,207
We're almost there!

26
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,749
Come, they're waiting for us
at the Sabar.

27
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,083
Come on!

28
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:28,920
Mum.

29
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:31,337
Seydou.

30
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:35,170
You were great.

31
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:36,754
Serious?

32
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:38,545
You danced so well.

33
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:40,962
I mean it.

34
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:42,504
Really.

35
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:46,671
Mum, l have to tell you something.

36
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:49,921
Go ahead, l'm listening.

37
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:56,671
I want to leave and go work abroad.

38
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,713
I didn't hear you well.

39
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,088
What did you say?

40
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,922
I want to leave.

41
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:12,589
I want to work in Europe
so l can help you out.

42
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,464
So many made it.

43
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:17,214
They're helping their families.

44
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:20,256
I want to become someone.
I want to help

45
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:22,089
I love music.

46
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:25,881
I can realize my dream there.
I can help my sisters.

47
00:07:26,132 --> 00:07:29,381
- Look where they sleep.
- The house is falling apart.

48
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:31,297
I want to help you

49
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:32,339
Enough!

50
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:35,590
Who told you this?

51
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:38,173
Who's put this idea in your head?

52
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:41,048
I don't need you to leave.

53
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:45,590
You have to stay here
and breathe the same air as me.

54
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,923
Leave, go become someone.

55
00:07:49,174 --> 00:07:50,423
Want to you help me? Stay.

56
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:53,632
Those who made it
are not any better than me.

57
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:55,548
Don't make up crap!

58
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:58,173
Those who left

59
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:02,549
are dead in the desert
or in the middle of the sea.

60
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,841
Dead bodies everywhere!

61
00:08:08,342 --> 00:08:09,674
Do you have any idea

62
00:08:09,925 --> 00:08:12,383
of how many people died at sea?

63
00:08:12,634 --> 00:08:14,508
Do you have any idea?

64
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:18,424
I was just kidding.

65
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:22,758
I'Il never go and leave you.

66
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:25,300
Seydou, you don't think.

67
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:27,634
You're so gullible.

68
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:31,134
You come and tell me
you want to leave.

69
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:35,717
Mum, it was just a joke.

70
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:38,092
Don't get all worked up, I was kidding.

71
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:46,425
Come on, mum, don't be angry.

72
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:48,843
You're my mum.

73
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:50,343
Don't be like that.

74
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:53,176
I love you.
I don't want to upset you.

75
00:08:54,636 --> 00:08:56,010
Come on, give me a smile.

76
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,135
I don't recognize you when you pout.

77
00:08:58,386 --> 00:09:00,426
You'll always be my mum.

78
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:03,343
Come on.

79
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:05,635
I love you.

80
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:08,093
Stop it.

81
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,927
Moussa, wait!

82
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:29,719
You're the one who put
this idea of a trip in his head?

83
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:32,177
What?
lt must be you.

84
00:09:32,512 --> 00:09:33,469
What?

85
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,969
Don't play dumb,
you know very well.

86
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,470
Yesterday, he told me he wants to leave.

87
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:40,512
Leave? No way.

88
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:43,095
I really don't think so.

89
00:09:43,388 --> 00:09:45,303
Leave? Not possible.

90
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:51,678
Mum, ltold you it was a joke.

91
00:09:52,304 --> 00:09:54,887
I pulled your leg and you believed me.

92
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:57,887
I know what l'm talking about.

93
00:09:58,138 --> 00:09:59,387
Don't get on my nerves.

94
00:09:59,888 --> 00:10:02,053
And you, stop messing with his head.

95
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:04,513
I have food, l have water, all is good.

96
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:06,513
I'm not moving from Senegal.

97
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:08,096
Leave? Never.

98
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:11,013
I told you he had nothing to do with it.

99
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:13,513
lt was a joke!

100
00:10:13,805 --> 00:10:15,888
I gave birth to you, I know you.

101
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,846
Now go to school.

102
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,846
What got into you?

103
00:10:25,264 --> 00:10:28,639
You know your mum.
lf she finds out, we're dead.

104
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,389
I said nothing,
I was just testing her.

105
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,680
Six months of secretly working!

106
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,222
What were you thinking? Six months!

107
00:10:37,098 --> 00:10:39,847
I worry about her being alone.
Shut up!

108
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,347
You feel guilty. I do too.

109
00:10:43,598 --> 00:10:45,430
But we have no choice.

110
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:47,264
I know we have no choice.

111
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:49,764
I said nothing...
Shut it!

112
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:53,515
Don't do this, I said nothing.

113
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:55,973
Let's not argue.

114
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:57,598
We're cool.

115
00:10:57,849 --> 00:10:59,723
Give me a break.
OK.

116
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:10,848
Cultural heritage encompasses
all the beautiful things in the world.

117
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:15,390
Things that were created
thanks to the brilliance of human beings.

118
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:26,559
Seydou, where were you?

119
00:12:26,977 --> 00:12:28,768
l've been looking for you!

120
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:31,684
You didn't see my calls?
No.

121
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:34,352
l've been waiting for hours!

122
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:36,519
You have to take my place.

123
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,560
I didn't look at my phone.

124
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:40,685
Hi, Mama.

125
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:45,227
Wait, we'll do something.

126
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:50,310
Did you hear what my mum said?

127
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,685
Did you?

128
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:54,519
"l've been looking for you.
You didn't see my calls? "

129
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,727
We can write a song.

130
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:57,978
Sure.

131
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:06,853
There's some wind.

132
00:13:09,771 --> 00:13:12,770
l've been looking for you
You didn't see my calls

133
00:13:13,104 --> 00:13:15,520
You never answer

134
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:20,478
l've been looking for you
You didn't see my calls

135
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:22,645
You never answer

136
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:24,021
Write it down.

137
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:27,521
You don't care about me
You don't give a damn

138
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:29,896
l'm nothing to you

139
00:13:30,605 --> 00:13:34,229
Why do you treat me like this, baby?

140
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:39,854
Why do you treat me like this, baby?

141
00:13:41,397 --> 00:13:44,771
I've followed you everywhere
I see you everywhere

142
00:13:44,813 --> 00:13:47,187
You don't care about me

143
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:52,188
Why do you reject this love
That I feel for you?

144
00:13:53,314 --> 00:13:55,938
I called you
You read my message

145
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:58,313
And you ignored me

146
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:02,397
l've been looking for you
You didn't see my calls

147
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:04,355
You never answer

148
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:08,522
You don't care about me
You don't give a damn

149
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:10,563
l'm nothing to you

150
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:14,439
You don't care about me
You don't give a damn

151
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,981
l'm nothing to you

152
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:40,149
Where's this Sisko?

153
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:44,399
Sure it's here?

154
00:14:57,608 --> 00:14:58,815
Hello.

155
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:00,774
Hello.

156
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:03,525
Are you Sisko?

157
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:08,941
What do you want?

158
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:13,233
We want information about the trip.

159
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:16,941
Who's sending you?

160
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:19,525
Some friends.

161
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,066
lfIwere you, I wouldn't go.

162
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:31,484
You think Europe is better than Africa.

163
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,067
Europe is nothing like you imagine.

164
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:38,067
What you see on TV is not real.

165
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:43,817
ln Europe, it's really cold.

166
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:48,609
There are so many people
sleeping on the streets.

167
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:50,484
ddld
What?

168
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:53,318
ln Europe, people on the streets?

169
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,027
ln Europe, people on the streets?

170
00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:57,027
- You think I'm Iying?
－ No.

171
00:15:58,111 --> 00:15:59,735
He thought so.

172
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:02,652
No, we only came to get information.

173
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:04,818
We need some advice.

174
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:06,318
You'll see

175
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:08,277
mothers and children dead,

176
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,068
thugs, criminals, thieves.

177
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:12,610
thugs, criminals, thieves.

178
00:16:13,153 --> 00:16:15,360
Dead bodies on the streets.

179
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:18,528
Siblings, couples, all dead.

180
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:20,736
lf you want to die, go!

181
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:22,194
But how.

182
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:24,486
You want to die, just go!

183
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:26,194
Enough questions!

184
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,528
Stop asking!

185
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,778
But

186
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:31,194
Get out!

187
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:41,528
So when you said you wanted to leave,
it was a load of crap?

188
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:43,987
You weren't serious? djdo

189
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:46,195
Look at me.

190
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:49,195
- You're scared?
lt's not that.

191
00:16:49,446 --> 00:16:51,320
Admit it.
Not at all.

192
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:52,654
Come on, say it.

193
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:54,529
So what's the point?

194
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,987
Yes, l'm scared.
You see?

195
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:02,820
OK.

196
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:06,278
Seydou,
you don't want to do this anymore?

197
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:08,946
Six months we've been preparing.

198
00:17:09,197 --> 00:17:11,779
We did so much work
to be able to go.

199
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,946
And our dreams?

200
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:16,779
l'm not going without you.

201
00:17:17,322 --> 00:17:18,738
Me neither.

202
00:17:18,989 --> 00:17:21,113
So now what? Europe is waiting for us.

203
00:17:21,822 --> 00:17:23,946
Think about your becoming a big star.

204
00:17:24,905 --> 00:17:29,071
White people will be asking you
for autographs.

205
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:34,281
You'll go on stage like a real star!

206
00:17:34,532 --> 00:17:36,447
What do you think? Give me a smile.

207
00:17:36,698 --> 00:17:38,114
Smile.

208
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:40,531
You know I'm scared,

209
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:42,864
but I won't stay here without you.

210
00:17:43,115 --> 00:17:45,031
Did you believe that nutcase?

211
00:17:45,282 --> 00:17:47,489
You saw his goatee?
Yes, but

212
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,989
You saw what he did.

213
00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:51,489
Okay.

214
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:53,947
Smile!

215
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,239
Come on.

216
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,740
You saw how he banged on the table?

217
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:00,198
He's crazy.

218
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:03,157
You heard what he said.
He was shouting …

219
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:07,157
You shit yourself?
Whatever.

220
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:10,823
Listen,

221
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:13,865
before leaving, we have to do something.

222
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:15,990
What?
Something.

223
00:18:16,241 --> 00:18:19,198
Whatever you want.
Just the two of us.

224
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,784
You two have to go to the cemetery
and visit the ancestors.

225
00:18:56,243 --> 00:18:59,034
You'll ask for permission to leave.

226
00:19:00,743 --> 00:19:02,617
Then, after three days,

227
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:04,742
come back here.

228
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:07,617
But we're ready to leave now.
We're in a rush.

229
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:08,909
Three days is long.

230
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:14,035
Come back in three days.

231
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:21,785
I'll have talked with them

232
00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:25,243
0e
I'll give you their answer.

233
00:19:46,328 --> 00:19:48,161
Greetings, dear ancestors,

234
00:19:48,412 --> 00:19:50,036
with our deepest respect.

235
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:53,536
We put ourselves entirely in your hands

236
00:19:54,412 --> 00:19:57,036
for a journey we're about to make.

237
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:58,827
We want to go to Europe.

238
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:02,370
We ask for your blessing.

239
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:06,578
lt's a difficult journey.
Many people die there.

240
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:09,495
We ask you to pray for us.

241
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:19,328
Please, watch over our families.

242
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:23,328
We're leaving without telling our mums.

243
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:27,746
We know we shouldn't
keep this from them.

244
00:20:27,997 --> 00:20:29,829
We ask our mums

245
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,454
to please forgive us
for what we're about to do.

246
00:20:33,705 --> 00:20:35,579
We know it's not right.

247
00:21:11,123 --> 00:21:12,247
You can leave.

248
00:21:13,165 --> 00:21:14,497
Go.

249
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,998
lt has four legs but can't walk.

250
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,373
A table!

251
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:43,832
lt's high and has a lot of lines.

252
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,207
A power linel

253
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,833
Where are you going?

254
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:21,833
Where are you going?

255
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:27,833
Listen, l'm going to take a trip. OK?

256
00:22:28,084 --> 00:22:30,875
l'm not going to stay long,
I'll be back soon.

257
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:32,543
Can I come too?

258
00:22:32,794 --> 00:22:34,918
lf I take you with me,

259
00:22:35,544 --> 00:22:37,709
who'll stay with mum?

260
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,751
lf she can't find you,
she'll blame who?

261
00:22:40,335 --> 00:22:41,626
You.

262
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:44,376
You see? lt'll be all my fault.

263
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:50,043
You're not leaving anymore?
Later.

264
00:22:50,294 --> 00:22:51,459
Sleep.

265
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,380
There's a guy who makes passports.

266
00:24:29,589 --> 00:24:32,713
So?
He does it for 100 dollars.

267
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:35,297
That's too much!
We have no choice.

268
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:05,090
Remove your hat.

269
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:47,091
Malick Mara.

270
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:48,800
Salif Bamba.

271
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:51,801
You are Malian from today.

272
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,051
But we are Senegalese.

273
00:26:42,137 --> 00:26:44,761
Border patrol.
Everyone passports in hand.

274
00:26:45,595 --> 00:26:47,844
Raise you head.
Hurry, ma'am.

275
00:26:49,804 --> 00:26:50,886
Faster.

276
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,553
Passport, sir.

277
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,803
What's your name?
Salif Bamba.

278
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:07,137
- And you?
－ Malick Mara.

279
00:27:07,138 --> 00:27:08,637
And you?
口 Malick Mara.

280
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:12,720
Where are you going?
Agadez.

281
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:14,387
Agadez?

282
00:27:14,638 --> 00:27:16,470
When was the passport issued?

283
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:19,887
Two years ago.
口 Really?

284
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,220
You're wearing
the same clothes for two years?

285
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:25,679
You think I'm stupid?

286
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,845
You should go straight to prison.

287
00:27:29,346 --> 00:27:32,471
50 dollars or prison? lt's your choice.

288
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:35,221
50 dollars?

289
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:37,846
Or prison, understood?

290
00:27:44,597 --> 00:27:45,680
Next.

291
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,346
Ma'am, you're next.

292
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:27,057
Libya?

293
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:31,432
What do you mean?
I'lI take you to Libya directly

294
00:28:31,724 --> 00:28:34,182
How much?
400 each. 800 total.

295
00:28:36,474 --> 00:28:37,473
What do you say?

296
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:39,848
800 is too much.

297
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:42,848
Our cars are brand new, look.

298
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:46,224
Guaranteed to arrive in Tripoli.

299
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:47,891
Tripoli?
Yes.

300
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:50,849
Once there,
we'll find a way to make money.

301
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,558
lf we go on like this,
we won't have enough for the trip.

302
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:56,183
Do we have a choice?

303
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,516
Fine.

304
00:28:57,809 --> 00:28:59,974
lt's illegal, we have to move quickly.

305
00:29:00,225 --> 00:29:01,974
Just to Tripoli?

306
00:29:02,225 --> 00:29:04,141
Even to Italy.
ltaly?

307
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:06,474
200 more. That makes 600 each.

308
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:08,099
Because you're my brothers.

309
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,683
What a boat!

310
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:11,892
Let's go.

311
00:29:12,726 --> 00:29:13,684
Where is it?

312
00:29:13,976 --> 00:29:16,184
I don't do it for everyone,
just for you.

313
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,559
The car over there.

314
00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:21,059
The grey one?
Wait there. Got it?

315
00:29:23,976 --> 00:29:25,642
Libya?

316
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:53,143
Hurry, guys!

317
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,852
Guys, wait here.
Take a good rest

318
00:30:00,853 --> 00:30:04,019
Guys, wait here.
Take a good rest.

319
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:08,352
As soon as the cars are full,
I'II come and pick you up.

320
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:36,270
Come on, guys.

321
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,687
Make space.

322
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:51,188
I'm warning you,
the desert is really dangerous.

323
00:30:51,814 --> 00:30:54,146
Believe me, it's really bad.

324
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:56,979
We will run into rebel groups.

325
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,979
lf they see your money, it's gone.

326
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,479
The most important thing
is to hide your money.

327
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:07,563
Understood?

328
00:31:07,855 --> 00:31:11,021
Some of you have hidden it
in your shoes, your clothes,

329
00:31:11,272 --> 00:31:12,771
all stitched in.

330
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:15,313
That's all good
but these guys are professional.

331
00:31:15,522 --> 00:31:17,064
They'll find it.

332
00:31:17,481 --> 00:31:20,105
As you are my Senegalese friends,

333
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:22,855
I'm giving you some advice.

334
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:27,439
The only spot where your money
will be safe

335
00:31:27,773 --> 00:31:29,105
and no one can find it,

336
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,480
is to put it up your ass.

337
00:31:36,356 --> 00:31:39,314
I'm telling you.
lf you don't want to, good luck.

338
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,523
Just have to stick it up?

339
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,690
No, you take the money

340
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:47,356
and you roll it tightly.

341
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:51,940
You roll it in plastic wrap,
so it slides in.

342
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:57,190
Listen, l'm giving you advice.

343
00:31:57,441 --> 00:32:00,356
Those who want, take it.

344
00:32:00,607 --> 00:32:03,315
I have one thing to say:
it's the safest bank.

345
00:32:04,941 --> 00:32:06,691
Good night, guys.

346
00:32:26,317 --> 00:32:27,774
lt's me.

347
00:32:32,568 --> 00:32:34,400
We're leaving tonight.

348
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:36,275
- Really?
- l swear.

349
00:32:36,526 --> 00:32:38,317
- Are you sure?
Yep.

350
00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:42,942
What time?

351
00:32:42,943 --> 00:32:44,442
Tonight, don't know the time.

352
00:32:50,193 --> 00:32:51,525
Moussa, is this nice?

353
00:32:51,776 --> 00:32:53,108
Take it.

354
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,609
Let me see.

355
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,193
Looks good?

356
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,276
How much?
Twenty.

357
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:24,735
Your turn next.

358
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:27,110
Me? ldon't think so.

359
00:33:34,903 --> 00:33:36,735
Got in?

360
00:33:43,445 --> 00:33:45,110
Easy, easy.

361
00:33:52,237 --> 00:33:53,195
Let me help.

362
00:36:22,452 --> 00:36:24,117
Someone felllStop!

363
00:36:26,493 --> 00:36:27,534
Stop!

364
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:29,951
I told you to hold on tight.

365
00:36:30,618 --> 00:36:31,576
Shut up!

366
00:36:53,536 --> 00:36:54,077

AII of you.

Follow him.

371
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,622
Follow him!

372
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,540
You take all our money and you leave us
in the middle of the desert.

373
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:46,332
Why are you doing this?
口 Thug!

374
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:49,415
We're not even in Libya
and you're abandoning us.

375
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:53,207
I have a child with me,
what am I supposed to do?

376
00:41:11,046 --> 00:41:13,588

Let's go!

381
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:11,881
Ma'am, get up, let's go.

382
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:32,632
Ma'am, stand up.

383
00:42:36,217 --> 00:42:38,132
Have you lost your mind?

384
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,716
The guide is leaving.

385
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:44,966
lf we lose him,
we'll die in the desert for sure!

386
00:42:55,134 --> 00:42:57,175
We're losing him!

387
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:29,345
Get up.

388
00:44:29,596 --> 00:44:30,845
Slowly.

389
00:44:31,554 --> 00:44:34,512
My son, you've come back.

390
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:13,055
Moussa, wait, we're coming!

391
00:45:18,514 --> 00:45:19,555
Coming.

392
00:45:25,474 --> 00:45:26,723
What is it?

393
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,098
Let's go

394
00:45:35,057 --> 00:45:36,181
Drink.

395
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,183
Stop!

396
00:46:13,434 --> 00:46:14,433
Police!

397
00:46:16,184 --> 00:46:17,308
On the ground!

398
00:46:55,185 --> 00:46:56,184
Hey, you!

399
00:46:56,435 --> 00:46:57,434
Get up!

400
00:46:58,518 --> 00:46:59,851
Where's your money?

401
00:47:02,018 --> 00:47:06,602
We're in Libyal
Give us your money or it's jail!

402
00:47:14,228 --> 00:47:15,185
Get up!

403
00:47:20,061 --> 00:47:21,268
On your feet!

404
00:47:21,603 --> 00:47:23,643
Where did you hide your money?

405
00:47:24,978 --> 00:47:26,143
I have no money.

406
00:47:26,394 --> 00:47:27,685
No money?

407
00:47:37,395 --> 00:47:38,686
Where's the money?

408
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,228
We'll see if it's in your ass.

409
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:53,395
Drink this!

410
00:47:53,396 --> 00:47:54,145
Drink this!

411
00:48:12,105 --> 00:48:13,812
Drink!

412
00:48:17,396 --> 00:48:18,355
Drink up!

413
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:25,980
Come on, drink!

414
00:48:42,022 --> 00:48:43,439
There's nothing here.

415
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:44,647
Go.

416
00:48:51,232 --> 00:48:53,022
Here neither.
Go.

417
00:48:56,273 --> 00:48:57,856
- Nothing.
Go!

418
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:01,856
Nothing here.
Go!

419
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,106
Go!

420
00:49:05,273 --> 00:49:06,689
Look at this.

421
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:10,482
You tried to cheat us.

422
00:49:10,733 --> 00:49:11,940
You cheated us!

423
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,023
You're coming with me! To prison!

424
00:49:17,316 --> 00:49:18,357
Get in!

425
00:49:20,024 --> 00:49:23,565
Please, take me too.
I don't want to stay alone.

426
00:51:28,988 --> 00:51:30,278
Nationality?

427
00:51:30,529 --> 00:51:32,112
Group 2, quick!

428
00:51:32,363 --> 00:51:34,320
Where are you from?
Congo.

429
00:51:34,571 --> 00:51:36,362
Group 3, quickl

430
00:51:36,863 --> 00:51:38,571
Where are you from?

431
00:51:38,864 --> 00:51:40,654
－ Senegal.
Group 3.

432
00:51:41,322 --> 00:51:42,738
Move quickly!

433
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:44,529
Where are you from?

434
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,238
Cameroon? Group 2.

435
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,740
I'm your middleman.

436
00:52:27,991 --> 00:52:29,698
I speak your language.

437
00:52:30,532 --> 00:52:32,656
l'm here to help you.

438
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:35,490
Do you know where you are?

439
00:52:35,741 --> 00:52:37,448
You're in prison.

440
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,948
The people you see here

441
00:52:42,366 --> 00:52:45,781
are not police nor military.

442
00:52:46,324 --> 00:52:49,031
They're really dangerous.
They're the Libyan mafia.

443
00:52:50,116 --> 00:52:52,907
Everything they ask you to do, do it.

444
00:52:54,283 --> 00:52:58,032
lf you don't, they'll harm you.

445
00:52:58,325 --> 00:53:00,366
Even worse, they could kill you.

446
00:53:01,575 --> 00:53:03,491
What you have to do

447
00:53:04,075 --> 00:53:08,241
is to call your parents back home
and ask them to send you money.

448
00:53:09,075 --> 00:53:11,032
800 dollars, not much

449
00:53:11,283 --> 00:53:13,407
to save your life.

450
00:53:16,242 --> 00:53:17,658
Call them.

451
00:53:18,409 --> 00:53:21,408
We can fix this and you'll be free.

452
00:53:22,618 --> 00:53:24,742
l'm telling you this

453
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,908
and I'll give you time
to think about it.

454
00:53:30,659 --> 00:53:33,158
I'll give you some time.

455
00:53:34,701 --> 00:53:37,700
You'll think about it
and find a solution.

456
00:54:29,995 --> 00:54:31,202
Hurry!

457
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:34,870
Come on!

458
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,245
You know where you are?

459
00:54:44,787 --> 00:54:46,786
ln a torture room.

460
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:50,286
Because they refused to give a number.

461
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,370
One thing is sure,

462
00:54:52,746 --> 00:54:56,245
if you don't give a number,
the same will happen to you.

463
00:54:57,372 --> 00:54:58,787
lf they don't give me a number,

464
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,412
I'II kill them.

465
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:04,621
Got it? With no number, you're dead.

466
00:55:04,872 --> 00:55:06,787
Look at those bodies,

467
00:55:07,038 --> 00:55:10,287
your brothers are dead
because of a number.

468
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:10,954
Give a number
and walk away from torture.

469
00:55:10,955 --> 00:55:14,496
Give a number
and walk away from torture.

470
00:55:14,747 --> 00:55:17,121
Either way, you'll end up giving it.

471
00:55:17,913 --> 00:55:20,204
You have a number, you give it.

472
00:55:20,455 --> 00:55:21,787
You have a number?

473
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,830
See? Do like him.

474
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:26,830
Who else?

475
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:28,163
Bravo!

476
00:55:28,414 --> 00:55:30,038
That's good.

477
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:32,330
Come on.

478
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,372
Nabil!

479
00:55:36,998 --> 00:55:39,163
They have numbers.
These three.

480
00:55:39,414 --> 00:55:40,455
Go ahead.

481
00:55:42,581 --> 00:55:43,830
Who else has a number?

482
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:46,872
Who?

483
00:55:48,999 --> 00:55:50,748
Do like your brothers.

484
00:55:51,999 --> 00:55:54,081
Guys, avoid all this.

485
00:55:54,332 --> 00:55:56,373
Give the number and call home.

486
00:55:56,874 --> 00:55:58,706
I'lI call for you.

487
00:55:58,957 --> 00:56:00,498
You don't have a number?

488
00:56:00,915 --> 00:56:02,539
No one?

489
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:04,748
l'm really sorry.

490
00:56:05,207 --> 00:56:06,373
Nabil.

491
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,498
They don't have a number.

492
00:56:10,749 --> 00:56:12,207
Come on!

493
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,374
You, come here.

494
00:57:39,753 --> 00:57:41,085
What is it?

495
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:46,043
l'm scared I won't see my mum again.

496
00:57:47,878 --> 00:57:50,168
I want to see her
to ask her to forgive me

497
00:57:51,628 --> 00:57:53,628
for secretly leaving.

498
00:57:55,545 --> 00:57:59,378
I want her to know that I'm alive,
I'm not dead.

499
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,961
Tell her that I miss her.

500
00:58:02,962 --> 00:58:04,419
I miss her.

501
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:06,086
So much.

502
00:58:07,462 --> 00:58:09,794
I want her to forgive me.

503
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,794
Malaika!

504
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:21,129
Come here.

505
00:58:40,713 --> 00:58:44,296
I'II give you a message
to take to Seydou's mum.

506
00:58:46,547 --> 00:58:48,213
Go to her,

507
00:58:48,464 --> 00:58:52,588
tell her that Seydou is alive and well,

508
00:58:53,422 --> 00:58:55,713
and asks for forgiveness.

509
00:58:56,006 --> 00:58:58,588
Tell her that he misses her a lot.

510
00:58:59,089 --> 00:59:00,463
Remember.

511
00:59:01,506 --> 00:59:02,671
He'll tell her.

512
00:59:03,714 --> 00:59:05,046
Can I go with him?

513
00:59:05,881 --> 00:59:07,047
No.

514
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,422
Please, l want to see my mum.

515
00:59:13,757 --> 00:59:16,047
OK, you can go with him.

516
00:59:16,632 --> 00:59:19,506
But only you will see her,
she won't see you.

517
01:00:15,592 --> 01:00:16,924
Mum.

518
01:00:18,509 --> 01:00:19,966
Mum.

519
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,925
Give me some water.

520
01:00:59,302 --> 01:01:00,593
Hey...

521
01:01:01,969 --> 01:01:03,510
You'll be fine.

522
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:06,801
Make some space for him to stretch.

523
01:01:44,971 --> 01:01:46,970
Wake up!

524
01:01:49,721 --> 01:01:51,262

525
01:01:51,638 --> 01:01:53,470
I need a carpenter.

526
01:01:53,763 --> 01:01:55,303
Who's a carpenter?

527
01:01:55,554 --> 01:01:56,970
Are you sure?

528
01:01:57,221 --> 01:01:58,512
lf not, you'll die.

529
01:01:58,804 --> 01:01:59,928
Go!

530
01:02:00,763 --> 01:02:02,304

535
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,554

536
01:02:20,139 --> 01:02:21,221
Sure?

537
01:02:27,473 --> 01:02:29,014
Move it!

538
01:02:34,181 --> 01:02:35,430
No one else?

539
01:03:05,307 --> 01:03:06,640
How much for this one?

540
01:03:06,891 --> 01:03:08,765
600 dinars, he's strong.

541
01:03:09,016 --> 01:03:10,431
Ok, l'll take him.

542
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:12,223
Come on.

543
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:15,681
We work together.

544
01:03:15,974 --> 01:03:18,557
I'lI cut you a deal if you take both.

545
01:03:19,392 --> 01:03:21,266
500 each.
That works.

546
01:04:03,809 --> 01:04:05,433
Here's the house.

547
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:11,684
You're going to build a solid wall
all around the house, OK?

548
01:04:14,477 --> 01:04:16,434
You'll sleep here.

549
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:18,934
There's food.

550
01:04:20,602 --> 01:04:22,434
And after, work.

551
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:09,770
Here's my family.

552
01:05:13,104 --> 01:05:14,978

555
01:05:22,105 --> 01:05:24,854
That's the second, she's 18.

556
01:05:25,522 --> 01:05:27,604
That's my son, he's 16.

557
01:05:27,855 --> 01:05:29,979
And their mum's here.

558
01:05:30,563 --> 01:05:32,146
－ She's beautiful.
Thanks.

559
01:05:33,313 --> 01:05:34,937
How old are you?

560
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:36,271
16.

561
01:05:36,938 --> 01:05:38,437
Like my boy.

562
01:05:41,647 --> 01:05:43,521
Did your dad know you were leaving?

563
01:05:46,939 --> 01:05:48,563
My dad died.

564
01:05:50,814 --> 01:05:52,272
May he rest in peace.

565
01:05:53,814 --> 01:05:54,938
And your mum?

566
01:05:56,231 --> 01:06:00,480
No, I left with my cousin
without telling her.

567
01:06:02,356 --> 01:06:04,230
Where's your cousin?

568
01:06:04,731 --> 01:06:07,980
They caught him
when we were in the desert.

569
01:06:15,315 --> 01:06:17,856
I'm sure we'll find him.

570
01:06:18,649 --> 01:06:19,856
Of course.

571
01:06:37,233 --> 01:06:38,732
You've done a good job.

572
01:06:38,983 --> 01:06:40,732
The boss is happy with you.

573
01:06:44,316 --> 01:06:45,607
There's something else.

574
01:06:46,525 --> 01:06:49,274
The boss wants a fountain Iike this one.

575
01:06:50,566 --> 01:06:52,357
Can you build it?

576
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:57,274
Yes, lcan do it.

577
01:06:57,941 --> 01:07:00,274
Like this one?
Even better.

578
01:07:00,775 --> 01:07:01,733
Are you sure?

579
01:07:02,901 --> 01:07:03,900
Yes.

580
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:09,191
lf you make it as good as this one
and the boss likes it,

581
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:12,816
he'll free you

582
01:07:13,067 --> 01:07:14,983
and pay for your trip to Tripoli.

583
01:07:15,234 --> 01:07:16,358
OK?

584
01:07:16,651 --> 01:07:17,566
Back to work.

585
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:39,944
You can see how it works.

586
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:47,612
See, we've built it
in the shape of an octagon.

587
01:08:50,446 --> 01:08:52,112
We used these splendid tiles.

588
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:55,612
The foundation comes from abroad.

589
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:58,529
Shall we see how it works?

590
01:10:17,908 --> 01:10:21,741
Hi, have you seen

01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:40,366
Seydou!

597
01:10:40,617 --> 01:10:41,741

He speaks Wolof.

599
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:48,950
How are you?

600
01:10:49,243 --> 01:10:52,075
Have you seen

605
01:10:59,868 --> 01:11:02,700
Ask them, Moussa could be there.

606
01:11:02,951 --> 01:11:05,659
He says there's
a Senegalese community over there.

607
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:06,950
Let's go. Thanks.

608
01:11:07,952 --> 01:11:09,368
No, wait.

609
01:11:12,994 --> 01:11:15,826

615
01:11:32,703 --> 01:11:35,577

Boy!
Yes?

633
01:12:57,498 --> 01:13:01,414
Maybe he got here,
didn't find you and then left?

634
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:04,955
lt's not possible.

635
01:13:05,206 --> 01:13:09,372
We left together.
I know he'd never go without me.

636

Then go check
the other Senegalese shelters

637
01:13:15,666 --> 01:13:17,206

I hope you find him.

662
01:16:20,214 --> 01:16:22,338
The Nigerians who work with me

I knew I'd find you again.

674
01:17:44,884 --> 01:17:46,216
Here I am.

675
01:17:46,467 --> 01:17:47,592
Let's go.

676
01:17:50,927 --> 01:17:52,051
What is it?

677
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,217
What's wrong?

678
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:59,676
I was shot.

679
01:18:00,677 --> 01:18:01,967
They shot you?

680
01:18:02,635 --> 01:18:06,426
I escaped from prison and they shot me.

681
01:18:07,052 --> 01:18:08,509
My leg.

682
01:18:11,968 --> 01:18:13,718
How did they shoot you?

683
01:18:23,761 --> 01:18:25,468
Let's go to the hospital.

684
01:18:26,344 --> 01:18:28,093
Get up, let's go.

685
01:18:29,178 --> 01:18:31,218
Let's return to Senegal.

686
01:18:31,469 --> 01:18:34,552
You know they won't let me in
at the hospital.

687
01:18:34,803 --> 01:18:35,760
Then what?

688
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,094
I want to go back home.

689
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:41,553
Why go back?

690
01:18:41,804 --> 01:18:44,761
They'll cut my leg.
No!

691
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:47,803
l'd prefer to die in Senegal.
You won't die.

692
01:18:48,012 --> 01:18:49,761
l'm here.

693
01:18:49,887 --> 01:18:52,761
Europe is so close, we're almost there.

694
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:56,011
We're so close to Europe.

695
01:18:56,595 --> 01:19:00,136
You were right
when you said we shouldn't go.

696
01:19:00,387 --> 01:19:03,137
Don't say that.
We shouldn't have left.

697
01:19:03,388 --> 01:19:05,762
You're a man.
Be strong and get over this.

698
01:19:06,638 --> 01:19:10,554
Remember you said
we'd sign autographs for the whites?

699
01:19:11,138 --> 01:19:12,929
Come on, let's go.

700
01:19:16,013 --> 01:19:17,179
Go?

701
01:19:17,846 --> 01:19:20,220
You really want to go back to Senegal?

702
01:19:27,264 --> 01:19:29,221
Sure you want to go home?

703
01:19:31,222 --> 01:19:34,471
After all we went through in the desert?

704
01:19:34,889 --> 01:19:36,846
We went through hell!

705
01:19:37,264 --> 01:19:41,596
How would you cross the desert
with this leg? lmpossible.

706
01:19:42,264 --> 01:19:44,471
You convinced me to leave.

707
01:19:44,889 --> 01:19:46,805
Remember?

708
01:19:47,014 --> 01:19:48,805
Stop this. Let's go.

709
01:19:48,972 --> 01:19:50,846
Europe is waiting for us.

710
01:19:51,097 --> 01:19:52,722
You and me.

711
01:19:52,973 --> 01:19:55,639
Let's realize our dream.
What do you think?

712
01:19:56,682 --> 01:19:58,514
Come on, get up.

713
01:19:58,973 --> 01:20:00,181
Let's go.

714
01:20:00,473 --> 01:20:03,222
lt's hurting me.
We'll go slowly.

715
01:20:03,473 --> 01:20:04,972
You're strong.

716
01:20:05,223 --> 01:20:07,056
We'll get through it.

717
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:17,515
When did it happen?

718
01:20:18,433 --> 01:20:19,807
Three days ago

719
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:22,473
Three days?

720
01:20:27,599 --> 01:20:29,723
You re lucky the bullet passed through.

721
01:20:31,724 --> 01:20:35,723
lt didn't touch the bone.
lt could have been much worse.

722
01:20:36,183 --> 01:20:38,640
I know it's painful.

723
01:20:40,224 --> 01:20:41,765
Can you sleep?

724
01:20:42,559 --> 01:20:43,933
No, l can't.

725
01:20:45,684 --> 01:20:48,433
Will they amputate?
No, don't worry.

726
01:20:50,684 --> 01:20:53,474
You have to get him
medication right away.

727
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:57,974
Disinfectant,
antibiotics and painkillers.

728
01:20:58,642 --> 01:21:02,641
I'll give him an injection
to stop the infection.

729
01:21:03,684 --> 01:21:06,308
I'II get all this at a pharmacy?

730
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,017
A pharmacy? No.

731
01:21:08,268 --> 01:21:11,392
Go to the market
and ask for the barber, Samir.

732
01:21:11,643 --> 01:21:13,892
Tell him I sent you.
Samir?

733
01:21:57,937 --> 01:22:00,352
Don't touch, your hands are dirty.

734
01:22:04,312 --> 01:22:06,311
I wasn't touching.

735
01:22:48,439 --> 01:22:50,313
lt's perfect.

736
01:22:52,439 --> 01:22:54,229
You OK?

737
01:22:55,397 --> 01:22:58,979
Seydou, can I speak to you a moment?

738
01:23:00,147 --> 01:23:02,313
- Take care, Moussa.
Thank you.

739
01:23:07,647 --> 01:23:10,896
I got the leg under control.

740
01:23:11,773 --> 01:23:15,022
I did my best,

741
01:23:15,273 --> 01:23:19,480
but you have to take him to hospital
as soon as possible.

742
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:24,022
They need to do an X- ray

743
01:23:25,356 --> 01:23:27,397
and then operate.

744
01:23:28,398 --> 01:23:32,814
I don't have the instruments.
There's nothing else I can do.

745
01:23:33,481 --> 01:23:35,814
His only hope is to get to hospital.

746
01:23:36,106 --> 01:23:40,690
But how? They don't admit blacks.

747
01:23:41,232 --> 01:23:43,690
I know, but there's no other option.

748
01:23:44,982 --> 01:23:46,898
lt's the only solution.

749
01:23:47,149 --> 01:23:48,981
You have to take him.

750
01:23:52,232 --> 01:23:53,981
How much time do we have?

751
01:23:55,566 --> 01:23:59,231
No time left, ten days at most.

752
01:24:00,441 --> 01:24:03,191
Otherwise, he's risking losing his leg.

753
01:24:04,567 --> 01:24:07,149
Believe me, it's a huge risk.

754
01:24:08,025 --> 01:24:09,482
He may even die.

755
01:24:09,733 --> 01:24:12,066
－ Seriously?
Of course.

756
01:24:43,901 --> 01:24:45,233
lt's him.

757
01:24:46,818 --> 01:24:48,150
Sit down.

758
01:24:52,569 --> 01:24:55,193
What's your name?
Seydou.

759
01:25:06,402 --> 01:25:08,651
lt's not even enough for one person.

760
01:25:09,027 --> 01:25:11,776
That's all I have.
That's it?

761
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:15,193
Here. Come back when you have enough.

762
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:19,110
Please, help me.

763
01:25:19,361 --> 01:25:22,027
That's all I have
and my cousin is injured.

764
01:25:22,278 --> 01:25:23,777
We really have to leave.

765
01:25:26,653 --> 01:25:27,527
How old are you?
16.

766
01:25:27,528 --> 01:25:28,860
How old are you?
16.

767
01:25:29,278 --> 01:25:30,569
·16?
Yes.

768
01:25:31,445 --> 01:25:33,860
Do you think it can work?

769
01:25:35,403 --> 01:25:38,027
Listen, l have a solution.

770
01:25:38,278 --> 01:25:40,069
lf you pilot the boat

771
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,528
you can both leave
for the price of one.

772
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:45,028
- The boat?
- Yes.

773
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:48,153
- l've never done that.
- I don't even know how to swim.

774
01:25:49,029 --> 01:25:51,403
No problem. I'll show you.

775
01:25:51,654 --> 01:25:54,361
- Very easy.
- ln one day, you'll be in ltaly.

776
01:25:55,071 --> 01:25:58,403
- ln one day, we'll be in ltaly?
- Just one day.

777
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:01,986
You just go straight ahead.

778
01:26:02,654 --> 01:26:04,653
And as you're a minor,

779
01:26:05,112 --> 01:26:08,737
if the police catch you, you don't risk much.

780
01:26:10,405 --> 01:26:12,279
But it's not sure they'll catch me?

781
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:14,821
No. When you see the police,

782
01:26:15,072 --> 01:26:17,862
stay away from the cabin.
There won't be a problem.

783
01:26:20,697 --> 01:26:23,071
- lt's easy?
- Very easy.

784
01:26:24,322 --> 01:26:26,571
I don't have time.
lf you two want to leave.

785
01:26:26,822 --> 01:26:29,237
it's the only way.
Or I'll find someone else.

786
01:26:32,698 --> 01:26:35,238
OK.
Great.

787
01:26:41,614 --> 01:26:42,572
Hey!

788
01:26:43,906 --> 01:26:46,322
We're going!
Where?

789
01:26:46,698 --> 01:26:48,155
Europe is waiting for us.

790
01:26:48,823 --> 01:26:51,280
How?
We're leaving for ltaly.

791
01:26:51,531 --> 01:26:54,572
There I can take you to hospital
and fix your leg.

792
01:26:54,948 --> 01:26:57,948
Then we'll call our mums
to tell them we're fine.

793
01:26:58,199 --> 01:26:58,823
Everything will be fine.

794
01:26:58,824 --> 01:27:00,448
Everything will be fine.

795
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:03,948
口 Where did you get the money?
That's not a problem.

796
01:27:04,407 --> 01:27:08,364
We didn't have enough.
So, they're having me drive the boat.

797
01:27:08,782 --> 01:27:10,573
Can you imagine?

798
01:27:10,824 --> 01:27:13,614
Excuse me, but you can't even swim.

799
01:27:14,907 --> 01:27:16,573
Who cares?

800
01:27:16,824 --> 01:27:20,114
Just got to hold the wheel straight
and we'll be in ltaly!

801
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:28,490
I can even speak ltalian!

802
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:36,949
I can also say that!

803
01:27:38,325 --> 01:27:39,782
Hurry up!

804
01:27:48,742 --> 01:27:49,116
ZUARA, LIBYA

805
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:02,283
Come in quicklyl

806
01:28:08,367 --> 01:28:10,575
I have to take them all?

807
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:13,701
Maybe there are other boats.

808
01:28:34,077 --> 01:28:35,034
Get over here!

809
01:28:38,911 --> 01:28:40,202
Come.

810
01:28:42,244 --> 01:28:44,035
I'll show you.

811
01:28:47,203 --> 01:28:49,577
That's the gear.

812
01:28:50,411 --> 01:28:54,202
Faster up, slower down.

813
01:28:55,453 --> 01:28:57,827
That's for moving forward and backwards.

814
01:28:58,078 --> 01:29:00,327
You go forward, you go back.

815
01:29:01,244 --> 01:29:02,911
Got it?
Yes.

816
01:29:03,370 --> 01:29:06,244
That's the compass.

817
01:29:06,829 --> 01:29:08,494
ln the middle of the sea,

818
01:29:08,745 --> 01:29:11,536
sometimes the current
will make the boat turn.

819
01:29:11,787 --> 01:29:16,828
So you have to stay on course,
always going north. Stay on zero.

820
01:29:17,079 --> 01:29:20,619
Zero is north. Straight ahead.
Got it?

821
01:29:21,495 --> 01:29:25,119
Sometimes, waves get really big...
You understand?

822
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:29,579
When they're big, you have to face them.
Not on the side.

823
01:29:30,455 --> 01:29:36,162
When the waves are big,
you take them on directly.

824
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:39,079
Don't move to the side. Understood?

825
01:29:39,413 --> 01:29:41,704
So we go with the waves?

826
01:29:41,955 --> 01:29:45,537
No, in general the sea is calm.
But you never know.

827
01:29:45,788 --> 01:29:48,495
Normally, there's no problem. OK?

828
01:29:50,496 --> 01:29:51,621
Here's the GPS.

829
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:55,705
lf you're in trouble, call this number.

830
01:29:56,497 --> 01:29:58,246
Just call.

831
01:29:58,831 --> 01:30:01,371
The boat is not good?
Yes, it's good.

832
01:30:01,622 --> 01:30:05,496
But you never know. lf ever there's
an issue with the engine, whatever.

833
01:30:05,747 --> 01:30:08,413
You call this number
and we can help.

834
01:30:08,664 --> 01:30:10,121
lt's good? Got it?

835
01:30:10,372 --> 01:30:11,538
Yes.

836
01:30:11,789 --> 01:30:15,413
Now, the most important thing:
the engine.

837
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,291
What's up?

838
01:31:16,792 --> 01:31:19,458
You have to find someone
to take my place.

839
01:31:19,959 --> 01:31:22,833
I can't drive that big boat.

840
01:31:23,084 --> 01:31:24,333
What do you mean?

841
01:31:25,084 --> 01:31:28,583
I showed you. lt's really easy.
Just straight ahead.

842
01:31:28,834 --> 01:31:31,500
I taught you how to drive it.
What's the problem?

843
01:31:33,001 --> 01:31:35,500
I can't be responsible

844
01:31:35,751 --> 01:31:37,542
for so many people.

845
01:31:39,043 --> 01:31:40,125
l'm scared.

846
01:31:40,585 --> 01:31:42,125
Why are you scared?

847
01:31:42,376 --> 01:31:44,709
There are so many people,
so many lives.

848
01:31:45,251 --> 01:31:47,292
There are children.

849
01:31:48,335 --> 01:31:49,584
There are women.

850
01:31:49,835 --> 01:31:50,625
I showed you how to drive it,
you agreed.

851
01:31:50,626 --> 01:31:52,084
I showed you how to drive it,
you agreed.

852
01:31:52,335 --> 01:31:53,917
Now do it and shut up.

853
01:31:54,335 --> 01:31:56,000
I'm scared to kill people.

854
01:31:56,252 --> 01:31:59,543
Find someone with experience.

855
01:32:00,836 --> 01:32:02,335
I have no experience.

856
01:32:02,586 --> 01:32:04,751
I don't care. You're doing it.

857
01:32:05,002 --> 01:32:07,960
Stop wasting my time.
You're driving the boat!

858
01:32:08,794 --> 01:32:10,460
Take him away!

859
01:32:12,044 --> 01:32:13,793
I'm scared I'll kill.

860
01:33:40,923 --> 01:33:44,005
Doesn't it feel like the sea is rising?

861
01:33:44,298 --> 01:33:45,339
What?

862
01:33:46,381 --> 01:33:48,214
You don't see the waves?

863
01:33:48,506 --> 01:33:51,464
They're higher.
lf water hits the engine, we're dead.

864
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:54,880
I don't think they've changed.

865
01:33:55,423 --> 01:33:58,005
They weren't like this. They're bigger.

866
01:33:58,381 --> 01:33:59,880
I don't see it.

867
01:34:01,341 --> 01:34:02,465
No.

868
01:34:33,758 --> 01:34:35,007
See the lights?

869
01:34:35,258 --> 01:34:36,549
Where?
Here.

870
01:34:43,925 --> 01:34:46,299
Look, we're here.

871
01:34:47,842 --> 01:34:49,132
We did it.

872
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,883
We're in Italy?
Definitely.

873
01:34:56,301 --> 01:34:58,550
Can you believe it? We made it.

874
01:34:58,759 --> 01:35:00,008
We did it!

875
01:35:01,134 --> 01:35:03,508
ln just five hours.

876
01:35:13,384 --> 01:35:16,759
But I can't see the shore.

877
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:19,384
What do you mean?

878
01:35:19,677 --> 01:35:21,843
Look, there's no land.

879
01:35:22,135 --> 01:35:24,551
That must be the port.

880
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:28,384
The city must be behind.

881
01:35:29,677 --> 01:35:31,634
Land is surely behind.

882
01:35:33,927 --> 01:35:35,176
That's just the port.

883
01:35:35,469 --> 01:35:37,968
I don't see a city, there's no land.

884
01:35:38,219 --> 01:35:40,969
What makes you say
there's something behind?

885
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:09,803
What's that?

886
01:36:14,929 --> 01:36:16,678
I've no idea.

887
01:36:19,429 --> 01:36:21,261
For sure it's not Italy.

888
01:37:26,224 --> 01:37:27,514
Move over.

889
01:37:36,307 --> 01:37:37,723
Ma'am, drink.

890
01:37:44,265 --> 01:37:45,640
Ma'am, be strong.

891
01:37:46,266 --> 01:37:47,099
We'll get there.

892
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:48,724
Be strong.

893
01:37:52,725 --> 01:37:54,682
You'll have your baby, safe and sound.

894
01:37:54,933 --> 01:37:56,390
You won't die.

895
01:37:56,725 --> 01:37:59,307
Okay? You won't die.

896
01:37:59,683 --> 01:38:02,849
I'II call for help.

897
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:04,349
Okay?

898
01:38:04,766 --> 01:38:08,599
On the boat,
there are people who are really sick.

899
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:11,350
And there are kids and women.

900
01:38:11,601 --> 01:38:13,391
Okay, there are women on board?

901
01:38:13,642 --> 01:38:15,516
Yes, there are women
and I can't keep going

902
01:38:16,267 --> 01:38:18,308
because there's a pregnant woman.

903
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:21,225
lf I keep going,
she'll get banged about,

904
01:38:21,476 --> 01:38:23,266
she's bleeding.

905
01:38:23,892 --> 01:38:26,850
She'll lose the baby.

906
01:38:28,351 --> 01:38:30,225
There's a pregnant woman who's bleeding?

907
01:38:30,476 --> 01:38:32,225
Yes, she's bleeding.

908
01:38:33,184 --> 01:38:34,183
l understand.

909
01:38:34,434 --> 01:38:37,767
You gave me your coordinates
and your GPS position.

910
01:38:38,018 --> 01:38:41,559
I'lI call for help now,
I'II call the coastguard.

911
01:38:41,810 --> 01:38:43,017
Thank you.

912
01:38:43,352 --> 01:38:45,142
Listen to me, this is important.

913
01:38:45,393 --> 01:38:47,267
lt will take time.

914
01:38:47,518 --> 01:38:48,684
What? !

915
01:38:50,393 --> 01:38:53,517
lt'll take time,
I'II call them immediately.

916
01:38:54,268 --> 01:38:56,934
Please, help us.

917
01:38:57,185 --> 01:39:00,351
I have your position,
I'lI forward it to them right now.

918
01:39:01,269 --> 01:39:02,977
I'II call them immediately.

919
01:39:03,228 --> 01:39:06,102
Hurry or that woman will die!

920
01:39:16,728 --> 01:39:18,518
But I'm telling you, I need help.

921
01:39:19,228 --> 01:39:20,768
OK, understood.

922
01:39:21,061 --> 01:39:24,852
l'm calling the Maltese coastguards.

923
01:39:25,144 --> 01:39:26,519
No answer.

924
01:39:26,854 --> 01:39:29,228
I also tried the ltalian coastguards.

925
01:39:29,770 --> 01:39:33,311
But they said you were not
in their territorial waters.

926
01:39:33,562 --> 01:39:36,478
They said I should keep calling
the Maltese guards.

927
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:38,936
l've been waiting for hours.
You don't want to come?

928
01:39:38,937 --> 01:39:39,853
l've been waiting for hours.
You don't want to come?

929
01:39:40,104 --> 01:39:44,978
l've been calling for hours too,
but there's no answer.

930
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:46,686
I'm really sorry.

931
01:39:47,854 --> 01:39:51,437
Please, l'm scared
someone's going to die.

932
01:39:52,146 --> 01:39:54,104
OK, I'II try again.

933
01:39:58,063 --> 01:40:01,520
l know you don't want to come.

934
01:40:02,938 --> 01:40:05,020
You want to let us die here,

935
01:40:05,521 --> 01:40:06,854
in the middle of the sea.

936
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:09,520
OK, I'II take responsibility.

937
01:40:09,771 --> 01:40:12,729
I'll get them to ltaly
and no one will die.

938
01:40:13,021 --> 01:40:15,187
They'll all arrive safe and sound.

939
01:41:32,275 --> 01:41:33,608
Does it hurt?

940
01:42:00,443 --> 01:42:03,484
People are sick in the engine room.

941
01:42:04,276 --> 01:42:05,692
ln the engine room?

942
01:42:05,943 --> 01:42:07,984
Yes, there are people there.

943
01:42:08,651 --> 01:42:10,484
How's that possible?

944
01:42:10,735 --> 01:42:12,067
Take over.

945
01:43:33,779 --> 01:43:35,571
There's no one left.

946
01:43:37,989 --> 01:43:39,529
Give me waterl

947
01:43:59,197 --> 01:44:00,739
More water!

948
01:44:46,116 --> 01:44:47,865
Sit down!

949
01:45:53,994 --> 01:45:55,451
Calm downl

950
01:45:59,910 --> 01:46:03,284
Don't you see
what you're doing could kill her?

951
01:46:05,745 --> 01:46:09,077
Calm downl You're men!

952
01:46:10,953 --> 01:46:12,494
You're men, dammitl

953
01:46:23,661 --> 01:46:25,244
We'll get there.

954
01:46:34,371 --> 01:46:36,203
No one will die, no onel

955
01:46:36,454 --> 01:46:39,161
No one will die!

956
01:46:40,662 --> 01:46:43,203
We are with Allah, no one will die.

957

Allah is greatl

958
01:46:48,246 --> 01:46:49,870
Allah is great!

959
01:47:02,247 --> 01:47:04,121
God is with us.

960
01:48:42,417 --> 01:48:44,125
Look, land!

961
01:48:44,876 --> 01:48:46,125
We're there!

962
01:49:39,003 --> 01:49:40,793
I'm the captain!

963
01:49:46,253 --> 01:49:47,752
I did it!

964
01:49:48,586 --> 01:49:50,169

965
01:49:50,837 --> 01:49:52,794
I saved everyone!

No one died, no one!

MOROCCO

MOROCCO
