1
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:03,161
Jimmy? Come on.
You're serving today.

2
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:06,598
Christine?
Where's my pants?

3
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:10,235
On the bed. If they had teeth
they would've bit you.

4
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:33,524
Jimmy! Go to the store, buy me
the newspaper and cigarettes.

5
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:36,494
Can't. Serving mass.
I'm an altar boy.

6
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:51,209
Hey, Kevin!

7
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:52,744
Hey, Jimmy!

8
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:24,459
There you are.

9
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:25,893
Overslept.

10
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:29,748
Well, you made it. I'll do the
cruets if you light the charcoal.

11
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,334
You think I'm fat?

12
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:37,538
You're all right. What?
Clothes don't fit?

13
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:39,173
No, they fit.

14
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:55,589
You're gonna be going to
the bakery after mass.

15
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:57,758
I am?
Why don't you go?

16
00:02:57,826 --> 00:02:59,961
I'm gonna be making breakfast.

17
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:01,128
I can make breakfast.

18
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:02,897
When have you ever?

19
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:04,665
Funny man.

20
00:03:07,102 --> 00:03:09,070
Good morning, Connie.
Good morning.

22

<i>Be seated.</i>

31
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:39,744
<i>What do you do when
you're not sure?</i>

32
00:04:41,964 --> 00:04:44,632
<i>That's the topic of
my sermon today.</i>

33
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:50,555
<i>Last year when President
Kennedy was assassinated,</i>

34
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:55,059
<i>who among us did not experience
the most profound disorientation?</i>

35
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:56,511
<i>Despair?</i>

36
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,265
<i>Which way?
What now?</i>

37
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:07,154
<i>What do I say to my kids?
What do I tell myself?</i>

38
00:05:08,957 --> 00:05:11,592
<i>It was a time of people
sitting together,</i>

39
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:15,963
<i>bound together by a common
feeling of hopelessness.</i>

40
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:19,784
<i>But think of that.</i>

41
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:26,423
<i>Your bond with your fellow
being was your despair.</i>

42
00:05:28,677 --> 00:05:32,379
<i>It was a public experience.
It was awful,</i>

43
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:36,067
<i>but we were in it together.</i>

44
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:43,757
<i>How much worse is it then for
the lone man, the lone woman,</i>

45
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:47,278
<i>stricken by a private calamity?</i>

46
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:53,634
<i>"No one knows I'm sick." "No one knows
I've lost my last real friend."</i>

47
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:59,206
<i>"No one knows I've
done something wrong."</i>

48
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:03,511
<i>Imagine the isolation.</i>

49
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:06,797
<i>Now you see the world
as through a window.</i>

50
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:10,034
<i>On one side of the glass,
happy untroubled people,</i>

51
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:12,837
<i>and on the other side, you.</i>

52
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:16,090
God bless you, Sister.

53
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,791
Thank you.

54
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,960
<i>I wanna tell you a story.</i>

55
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:28,786
<i>A cargo ship sank one night.
It caught fire and went down,</i>

56
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:32,623
<i>and only this one
sailor survived.</i>

57
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:35,843
<i>He found a lifeboat,
rigged a sail,</i>

58
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,561
<i>and being of a
nautical discipline</i>

59
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:41,382
<i>turned his eyes to the
heavens and read the stars.</i>

60
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:46,437
<i>He set a course for his home,
and, exhausted, fell asleep.</i>

61
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:47,638
Just keeps going on.

62
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:50,324
<i>Clouds rolled in,</i>

63
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:57,932
<i>and for the next 20 nights, he
could no longer see the stars.</i>

64
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:03,503
<i>He thought he was on course, but
there was no way to be certain.</i>

65
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:07,841
<i>And as the days rolled on,
and the sailor wasted away,</i>

66
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:12,796
<i>he began to have doubts.</i>

67
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:14,465
He just keeps on going.

68
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:17,101
<i>Had he set his course right?</i>

69
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:20,588
<i>Was he still going
on towards his home?</i>

70
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:26,693
<i>Or was he horribly lost and
doomed to a terrible death?</i>

71
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:31,098
<i>No way to know.</i>

72
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:34,535
<i>The message of the
constellations,</i>

73
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:39,340
<i>had he imagined it because of
his desperate circumstance?</i>

74
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:41,359
<i>Or had he seen truth once...</i>

75
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,361
Straighten up!

76
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:48,582
<i>and now had to hold on to it
without further reassurance?</i>

77
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:53,287
<i>There are those of
you in church today</i>

78
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:56,607
<i>who know exactly the crisis
of faith I describe,</i>

79
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:00,511
<i>and I wanna say to you,</i>

80
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:08,436
<i>doubt can be a bond as powerful
and sustaining as certainty.</i>

81
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:15,676
<i>When you are lost,
you are not alone.</i>

82
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:24,969
<i>In the name of the Father, the
Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.</i>

83
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:29,240

Hey, champ.

88
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:00,504
That was some sermon.

89
00:09:02,157 --> 00:09:05,243
Did it mean something to you?

90
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,195
I wanna do that.
I wanna be a priest.

91
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:14,318
You'd be a good one,
I'm sure. Here.

92
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,959
Take a look.

93
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:30,167
See?

94
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:35,889
She's dancing.
Kind of neat?

00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:37,058
Yeah.

96
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,725

Welcome.

100
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:23,330
Like Noah's Ark,
girls. Two by two.

101
00:11:23,398 --> 00:11:25,031
- Maryanne said it.
- Let's do it together.

102
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:26,834
- Okay.
- Yeah. It's true.

103
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:28,836

00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:32,606
Good morning, Father Flynn.
Beautiful day.

106
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:35,175
Not too bad.
How're the criminals doing today?

107
00:11:35,243 --> 00:11:36,743
Not bad, Father.

108
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:37,944
Good, Father.

109
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:39,146
Morning, champ.

110
00:11:39,214 --> 00:11:40,847
Morning, Father Flynn.

111
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:42,749
You wash those hands
today, Mr. London?

112
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:44,584
I washed them, Father.

113
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:46,720
I don't know. They're a
different color than your neck.

114
00:11:49,057 --> 00:11:49,907
Morning.

115
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,009
Morning, Father Flynn.

116
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:53,127
Sister, are we having
the test today?

117
00:11:53,194 --> 00:11:54,411
Get in line.

118
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,080
Tomorrow, William.

119
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:57,314
Is it long division?

120
00:11:57,381 --> 00:11:58,415
Among other things.

121
00:11:58,483 --> 00:11:59,650
Sister.

122
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,218
Good morning, Sister.

123
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:02,486
How much of it
will be long division?

124
00:12:02,553 --> 00:12:04,321
Boy!

125
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:09,176
William London.
Come up here.

126
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:13,747
Come smartly, now.

127
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:18,802
Don't make me wait.

128
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,739
What did he do?

129
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:24,825
He touched
Sister James.

130
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:26,593
The dragon is hungry.

131
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:28,562
You don't
touch a nun.

132
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:41,859
Take out your history books,
please. Turn to page 683.

133
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:45,912
Yes, Ralph.

134
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,282
I forgot my history book.

135
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:50,551
You can look on with Raymond.

136
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:54,571
Mr. London?

137
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,590
Do you have your history book?

138
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:57,641
No, Sister.

139
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,609
Share with
Mr. Malloy, please.

140
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:02,028
Do I have to?
His breath stinks!

141
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:10,087
I'm sure Mr. Malloy's
breath is just fine.

142
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:15,325
Be seated.

143
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:24,101
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the
32nd president of the United States.

144
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:28,021
That barrette out of
your hair, Miss Horan.

145
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:30,390
Yes, Sister.

146
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:34,194
Morning, Sister James.
Continue.

147
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:35,929
Franklin D. Roosevelt,
together with

148
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:39,049
Abraham Lincoln and
John Fitzgerald Kennedy,

149
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:42,520
was perhaps our greatest president.
When he assumed office,

150
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:45,655
13 million people in this
country were unemployed.

151
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:47,191
They'd lost hope,

152
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:49,393
and President Roosevelt
said to these people,

153
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:53,730
"The only thing we have
to fear is fear itself."

154
00:13:55,016 --> 00:13:58,302
What did he mean
by that? James?

155
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:02,088
I think he was trying to say
there's nothing really wrong.

156
00:14:02,156 --> 00:14:05,025
You know?
So don't get so emotional.

157
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:06,560
Maybe.

158
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:09,696
Maybe he was saying that
the world is good

159
00:14:09,764 --> 00:14:12,532
and we need only work together
to overcome our problems.

160
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,668
What's this,
Mr. Conroy?

161
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:18,772
I don't know, Sister.

162
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:25,479
You don't know you have a
wire coming out of your ear?

163
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:26,780
No.
Huh?

164
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:30,283
Huh?

165
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:32,169
No, Sister.
I didn't.

166
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,641
You come with me, boy.

167
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,850
Go.

168
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:56,543
Who knows
what the New Deal was?

169
00:14:57,595 --> 00:15:01,181
♪ The first noel

170
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:04,618
♪ The angels did say

171
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:10,490
♪ Was to certain poor shepherds
in fields as they lay

172
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:12,342
I love this song.

173
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:18,698
♪ In fields where they lay
keeping their sheep

174
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:25,306
♪ On a cold winter's night
that was so deep ♪

175
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:44,317
This past Sunday, what do you think
that sermon was about? Sister James?

176
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:46,787
Huh?

177
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:49,540
What was Father Flynn's
sermon about?

178
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:56,563
Well, doubt.
He was talking about doubt.

179
00:16:57,982 --> 00:16:59,583
Why?

180
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:02,352
Excuse me, Sister?

181
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,339
Well, sermons come from
somewhere, don't they?

182
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:07,941
Is Father Flynn in doubt?

183
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:11,861
Is he concerned that
someone else is in doubt?

184
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:13,564
I suppose you'd
have to ask him.

185
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:15,665
No, that would not
be appropriate.

186
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:17,384
He is my superior,

187
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:20,286
and if he were troubled he should
confess it to a fellow priest

188
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:22,088
or to the monsignor.

189
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:24,791
We do not share intimate
information with priests.

190
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:25,959
No.

191
00:17:26,026 --> 00:17:27,444
That's true.

192
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:31,815
What are we saying?

193
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,118
I want you all to be alert.

194
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:42,125
I am concerned, perhaps needlessly,
about matters in St. Nicholas School.

195
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:48,281
Academically?

196
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:53,770
I was not inviting a guessing
game, Sister Raymond.

197
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:02,606
Missy! Get away from her,
and sit down.

198
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,581
May I join you,
Sister Aloysius?

199
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,183
Yes.

200
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,721
Chicken chow mein.

201
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,823
Sister Veronica's favorite.

202
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:22,009
It's very good.

203
00:19:22,076 --> 00:19:25,345
I like the noodles.
I like the crunch.

204
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:30,133
What happened to
William London?

205
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:31,834
I sent him home.

206
00:19:31,902 --> 00:19:34,271
Oh, dear.
So he's still bleeding?

207
00:19:35,406 --> 00:19:37,006
Yes.

208
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,475
His nose just let loose

209
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:40,777
and started gushing during
the Pledge of Allegiance.

210
00:19:40,844 --> 00:19:42,295
Was it spontaneous?

211
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:43,480
What?

212
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:44,848
His nosebleed.

213
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:48,151
What else would it be?

214
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:49,736
Self-induced.

215
00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:51,104
Mmm-hmm.

216
00:19:51,171 --> 00:19:52,239
You mean you think

217
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:55,408
he might have intentionally
given himself a nosebleed?

218
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:57,127
Exactly.

219
00:19:58,112 --> 00:19:59,212
No.

220
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:05,051
You are a very innocent
person, Sister James.

221
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,088
William London
is a fidgety boy.

222
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:11,525
If you do not keep right on him, he
will do anything to escape his chair.

223
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:15,879
He would set his foot on fire
for half a day out of school.

224
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:19,549
Here. Sister, allow me
to help you. Your sleeve.

225
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:21,518
Uh-oh.

226
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,053
Let's see.

227
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:25,989
Oh, thank you, Sister.

228
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,578
Sister Veronica is going blind.

229
00:20:31,645 --> 00:20:33,113
Oh, how horrible.

230
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:35,549
If they find out in the
rectory, she'll be gone.

231
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:40,420
So if she looks unsteady,
take her hand.

232
00:20:40,588 --> 00:20:46,292
Ordinarily I assign my most
experienced teachers to eighth grade,

233
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:50,997
but I am working
within constraints.

234
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:55,452
Are you in control
of your class?

235
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,954
I think so.

236
00:20:58,022 --> 00:21:01,141
Usually more students
are sent down to me.

237
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:04,945
I try to take care
of things myself.

238
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:06,913
That can be an error.

239
00:21:06,981 --> 00:21:10,384
You are answerable to me,
I to the monsignor,

240
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:13,119
he to the bishop, and so
on up to the Holy Father.

241
00:21:13,187 --> 00:21:15,789
There is a chain.
Make use of it.

242
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,509
Candy?

243
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:21,545
Cough drops.

244
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:23,696
Candy by another name.

245
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:28,151
How is Donald Miller doing?

246
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:29,886
Steady.

247
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:31,054
Good.

248
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:35,892
That girl, Noreen Horan.

249
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,929
I've seated her as far away
from the boys as possible.

250
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,397
Doesn't do much good.

251
00:21:40,464 --> 00:21:41,598
Mmm.

252
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:45,752
Just get her through intact.

253
00:21:50,057 --> 00:21:51,742
What's this?

254
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:59,416
The wind is so peripatetic
this year.

255
00:22:01,168 --> 00:22:03,687
Is that
the word I want?

256
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:05,021
Is something
the matter?

257
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:07,791
What?

258
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:09,025
Is something
the matter?

259
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,144
No.

260
00:22:11,211 --> 00:22:14,514
Why? Is something
the matter?

261
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:16,149
I don't think so.

262
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:18,351
Well, then, nothing's
the matter then.

263
00:22:18,418 --> 00:22:19,786
Yes.

264
00:22:19,854 --> 00:22:21,320
What's this?

265
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:23,457
A pen.

266
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:26,209
A ballpoint pen.

267
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:29,646
The students are not using
them for assignments, I hope.

268
00:22:29,713 --> 00:22:31,214
No, of course not.

269
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:34,151
I am sorry I allowed even
cartridge pens into this school.

270
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:36,820
Always easy way out,
these days.

271
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:42,209
Every easy choice today will
have its consequence tomorrow.

272
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:43,093
Mark my words.

273
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,227
Yes, Sister.

274
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:46,196
Ballpoints make them
press down.

275
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,165
When they press down,
they write like monkeys.

276
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:50,066
I don't allow them
ballpoint pens.

277
00:22:50,134 --> 00:22:52,068
And yet here one is.

278
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:58,041
Penmanship is dying all
across this country.

279
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:00,243
I hope not.

280
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,247
You should frame something.

281
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:08,635
Put it up on the blackboard.
Put the pope up.

282
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:12,172
That's the wrong pope.
He's deceased.

283
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,043
I don't care what pope it is.
Use the glass to see behind you.

284
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:21,230
Children should think you have
eyes in the back of your head.

285
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:23,266
Wouldn't that be
a little frightening?

286
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,319
Only to the ones
who are up to no good.

287
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,278
Relax.
Put it up there.

288
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,450
All right, now.

289
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:44,420
The thing about shooting from the
foul line is it's psychological.

290
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,290
All right, come up
with a routine.

291
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:50,226
You shift your weight,
move your hips...

292
00:23:51,428 --> 00:23:52,863
Yeah, you think
that's funny, Ralph?

293
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,464
You know what's funny is you
never getting a foul shot.

294
00:23:56,333 --> 00:24:01,170
All right, concentrate on the routine,
and you'll forget to get tensed up.

295
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,609
All right, go ahead, Jimmy.

296
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:15,184
Good man. You listen. That's good.
All right, now sit down, everyone.

297
00:24:16,487 --> 00:24:18,488
Good.

298
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:24,177
On another matter, I've noticed
several of you guys got dirty nails.

299
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:27,980
All right, I don't
want to see that.

300
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:29,516
I'm not talking about
the length of your nails.

301
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:31,968
I'm talking about cleanliness.

302
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:34,254
See, look at my nails.

303
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:39,176
All right, they're long.

304
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:41,061
Whoa!

305
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:47,099
Yeah, I like them a little long,
but look at how clean they are.

306
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:58,511
That makes it okay.

307
00:25:02,383 --> 00:25:06,786
The climpity-clomp.
Clomp-clomp-clomp.

308
00:25:06,854 --> 00:25:09,072
Harder than
a herd of elephants.

309
00:25:13,677 --> 00:25:15,628
You are wicked!

310
00:25:15,696 --> 00:25:17,663
No, I told her,
"You're her mother.

311
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:21,450
"You raised her. You fed her.
You tell her she's fat."

312
00:25:21,518 --> 00:25:23,636
But wait, how fat is she?

313
00:25:23,704 --> 00:25:25,104
What, the mother
or the daughter?

314
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:26,373
The daughter.

315
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,891
I never met the daughter.

316
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,358
What about the mother?

317
00:25:29,426 --> 00:25:30,526
Fat.

318
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:26,916
Father, we having
practice after school?

319
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:30,286
If you guys want it,
we can have it. Let me know.

320
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:36,409
The Fascist governments
of Germany and Italy

321
00:26:36,477 --> 00:26:39,445
were already working together.

322
00:26:39,513 --> 00:26:41,881
They formed the Pact of Steel.

323
00:26:42,883 --> 00:26:44,383
The Pact of Steel was...

324
00:26:44,451 --> 00:26:45,952
Hi.
Hi.

325
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:50,540
a military alliance between
Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.

326
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:55,212
Mr. London, get back in your seat and
stop bothering Miss Horan, please.

327
00:26:58,882 --> 00:27:00,100
Now, who can tell me...

328
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:05,838
Yes?

329
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,874
Yes. Of course, Father.

330
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:13,747
Donald? You should
go to the rectory.

331
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:25,258
Two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

332
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:31,598
Go one, two, three, touch.
One, two, three, kick.

333
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:36,903
And back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front. Again.

334
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,472
<i>♪ We began to dance</i>

335
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,758
<i>♪ Swaying to and fro</i>

336
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,963
<i>♪ And soon I knew
I'd never let him go</i>

337
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,566
Raymond, what are you doing?

338
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:50,900
The mashed potato.

339
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:53,069
You're supposed to be
doing the bossa nova.

340
00:27:53,137 --> 00:27:54,337
But I know the mashed potato.

341
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:55,805
Oh...

342
00:27:58,192 --> 00:28:02,995
All right, now follow.
Back, side, front, kick.

343
00:28:03,063 --> 00:28:08,000
Back, side...
One, two, three, kick.

344
00:28:08,068 --> 00:28:13,038
Back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front...

345
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:18,594
Let me get in front of you so
that you can see what I'm doing.

346
00:28:19,696 --> 00:28:22,549
And one, two, three, touch.

347
00:28:22,616 --> 00:28:25,818
One, two, three, kick.

348
00:28:25,886 --> 00:28:31,791
Back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front...

349
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:36,362
Okay. This is really good.
Very good there.

350
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,264
<i>♪ Now I'm glad to say</i>

351
00:28:38,331 --> 00:28:41,618
<i>♪ I'm his bride to be</i>

352
00:28:41,685 --> 00:28:46,506
<i>♪ And we're gonna
raise a family ♪</i>

353
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:20,072
Donald,
are you feeling ill?

354
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,741
No.

355
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:23,409
Are you sure?

356
00:29:23,477 --> 00:29:24,493
Yes.

357
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:28,364
Are you all right?

358
00:29:29,332 --> 00:29:30,966
I just want to go home.

359
00:29:51,872 --> 00:29:53,573
Good afternoon, Sister.

360
00:29:53,641 --> 00:29:56,092
Good afternoon, Sister James.

361
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,462
Sister, can I speak with
you about Donald Miller?

362
00:30:02,316 --> 00:30:04,250
Is he
being accepted?

363
00:30:04,318 --> 00:30:05,851
He has no friends.

364
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,538
That would be a lot to
expect after only two months.

365
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:13,092
Has anyone hit him?

366
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:14,344
No.

367
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:17,430
Someone will.

368
00:30:17,498 --> 00:30:23,536
And when that happens, send
them right down to me.

369
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:27,407
I'm not so sure anyone will.

370
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:32,011
This parish serves Irish
and Italian families.

371
00:30:32,078 --> 00:30:34,514
Someone will hit Donald Miller.

372
00:30:36,016 --> 00:30:37,817
He has a protector.

373
00:30:38,485 --> 00:30:39,585
Who?

374
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:47,193
Father Flynn.

375
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:54,867
What?

376
00:30:58,738 --> 00:31:00,739
He's taken an interest.

377
00:31:18,025 --> 00:31:21,594
I told you to come to me, but
I hoped you never would.

378
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:24,363
Maybe I shouldn't have.

379
00:31:27,234 --> 00:31:29,235
So, it's happened.

380
00:31:30,905 --> 00:31:33,289
What? Oh, no.
I'm not telling you that.

381
00:31:33,357 --> 00:31:36,075
I'm not even certain
what you mean.

382
00:31:36,142 --> 00:31:38,060
Oh, excuse me there, Sisters.

383
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:41,030
No bother. We're done here.
Come, Sister.

384
00:31:51,925 --> 00:31:53,726
What have you seen?

385
00:31:55,328 --> 00:31:57,362
It is unsettling to look
at people with suspicion.

386
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,065
I feel less close to God.

387
00:31:59,132 --> 00:32:01,300
When you take a step
to address wrongdoing,

388
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:05,638
you are taking a step away
from God, but in his service.

389
00:32:06,406 --> 00:32:08,274
What have you seen?

390
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:11,995
Good afternoon, Sisters.

391
00:32:12,062 --> 00:32:14,831
Good afternoon, Mrs. Carson.
Why the cat?

392
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:18,250
'Cause there's a mouse.
Want some tea?

393
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:20,536
If you don't want to dance with
her, don't dance with her.

394
00:32:20,604 --> 00:32:21,987
Well, is it wrong?

395
00:32:22,055 --> 00:32:23,206
No.

396
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:26,342
But what if the girl
turns you down?

397
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:31,697
All right, you have the right
to ask a girl to dance.

398
00:32:31,765 --> 00:32:34,516
All right, she has the
right to turn you down.

399
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:37,937
The trick is,
don't take it to heart.

400
00:32:38,005 --> 00:32:40,556
What if they all turn you down?

401
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,026
Well, then you become a priest.

402
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:51,200
All right, next question.

403
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,311
What have you seen?

404
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,019
He called Donald Miller
to the rectory.

405
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:11,788
What for?
A talk.

406
00:33:11,855 --> 00:33:13,005
Alone?
Yes.

407
00:33:13,072 --> 00:33:14,056
When?

408
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,991
A week ago during class.

409
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:17,760
Why didn't you tell me?

410
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:21,097
I didn't think there was
anything wrong with it.

411
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:29,388
Of all the children,
Donald Miller.

412
00:33:31,174 --> 00:33:32,508
I suppose it makes sense.

413
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:34,159
How does it make sense?

414
00:33:34,227 --> 00:33:35,878
He's isolated.

415
00:33:35,946 --> 00:33:37,930
I don't know
that anything is wrong.

416
00:33:37,998 --> 00:33:41,233
Our first Negro student.

417
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:44,554
I thought there would be
fighting. Thought we...

418
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:48,474
A parent or two to deal with.

419
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:54,079
I should have foreseen
this possibility.

420
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:56,649
How could you imagine it?

421
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,219
Well, it's my job to outshine
the fox in cleverness.

422
00:34:04,724 --> 00:34:06,192
That is my job.

423
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,060
But maybe it's nothing.

424
00:34:11,865 --> 00:34:15,101
Then why do you look like
you've seen the devil?

425
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:22,091
It's just the way the boy acted
when he came back to class.

426
00:34:22,209 --> 00:34:23,209
He said something?

427
00:34:23,276 --> 00:34:24,316
No, it was his expression.

428
00:34:24,377 --> 00:34:26,278
He looked frightened.

429
00:34:26,346 --> 00:34:30,667
And he put his head on the desk
in the most peculiar way, and...

430
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:37,890
And one other thing, I think
there was alcohol on his breath.

431
00:34:43,363 --> 00:34:47,266
There was alcohol
on his breath.

432
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,702
Years ago at Saint Boniface
there was a priest.

433
00:35:11,741 --> 00:35:16,045
But I had Father Scully then.

434
00:35:19,766 --> 00:35:24,453
Here, there's no man I can go to.
Men run everything.

435
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,423
We are going to have
to stop him ourselves.

436
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,228
There we go. She got him.
Takes a cat.

437
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:37,232
Yes, it does.

438
00:35:44,024 --> 00:35:46,024
Yes, it does.

439
00:36:27,317 --> 00:36:28,985
This towel will never
be dead white again.

440
00:36:29,052 --> 00:36:30,452
Yes, it will.

441
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,687
Mrs. Carson.

442
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:33,422
I'm fine.

443
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:34,523
What happened?

444
00:36:34,591 --> 00:36:36,058
There's a branch down.

445
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:38,110
- Are you all right, Sister?
- She didn't see it.

446
00:36:38,178 --> 00:36:42,298
Fine. Just bushwhacked.
No need for a fuss.

447
00:36:42,365 --> 00:36:44,333
You just go lie down.
I'll bring you some tea.

448
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:46,402
- Come with me.
- I just...

449
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:47,770
I'll get you
a compress.

450
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,806
I did not fail to see it.

451
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:50,907
<i>MR. McGUINN: Hello?
Yes, Sister.</i>

452
00:36:50,974 --> 00:36:52,341
Mr. McGuinn.

453
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:55,044
Could you look in on the courtyard?
I've got branches falling.

454
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:56,178
<i>What has?</i>

455
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:57,613
A branch has!

456
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:06,605
Watch your step here,
Sister. I'll cut it up.

457
00:37:08,775 --> 00:37:11,343
The world is crashing, Michael.

458
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:14,780
I haven't heard a wind like
that since I left Mullingar.

459
00:37:14,847 --> 00:37:18,417
I've never known a wind like it.
The wind has changed.

460
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:44,142
What are you doing
out here, Conroy?

461
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:47,345
I talked in class, Father.

462
00:37:59,426 --> 00:38:01,760
Waiting for Sister Aloysius.

463
00:38:05,231 --> 00:38:07,399
She know you're here?

464
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:08,784
She knows.

465
00:38:11,938 --> 00:38:14,039
Good morning, Father Flynn.
Good of you to come by.

466
00:38:14,107 --> 00:38:16,208
Morning, Sister Aloysius.
How are you today?

467
00:38:16,275 --> 00:38:17,343
I'm very well, thank you.

468
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,610
Mr. Conroy.

469
00:38:18,678 --> 00:38:19,678
Yes, Sister.

470
00:38:19,746 --> 00:38:21,580
Mr. Transistor Radio.

471
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,568
Multiplication table,
10 times, in its totality,

472
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,370
delivered to me
tomorrow morning.

473
00:38:27,437 --> 00:38:28,904
Legible, boy.

474
00:38:30,273 --> 00:38:33,926
Return to class.
Go. Go, go.

475
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:48,140
I'd invite you in, but we're
just short Sister James.

476
00:38:54,764 --> 00:38:56,398
Hear that wind last night?

477
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:58,017
I certainly did.

478
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,820
Oh.

479
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,772
Did I hear Sister
Veronica had an accident?

480
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,443
Yeah. Sister Veronica fell,
practically killed herself.

481
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,561
Is she all right?

482
00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:09,945
Oh, she's fine.

483
00:39:12,732 --> 00:39:14,149
Her sight isn't good, is it?

484
00:39:14,217 --> 00:39:17,135
Her sight is fine.
Nuns fall, you know.

485
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:20,339
Nah, I didn't know that.

486
00:39:20,407 --> 00:39:23,976
It's the habit. It catches
us up more often than not.

487
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:26,178
Hmm.

488
00:39:26,246 --> 00:39:28,413
We go down like dominoes.

489
00:39:29,582 --> 00:39:30,749
Am I past the time?

490
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,084
Not at all.

491
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:33,836
Good morning, Father.
Good morning, Sister.

492
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:35,988
I'm sorry I was delayed.

493
00:39:36,055 --> 00:39:37,789
I ran into Sister Veronica.

494
00:39:37,891 --> 00:39:39,041
How is she?

495
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:41,643
I'm afraid she has a
bit of a bloody nose.

496
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:44,897
I'm beginning to think
you're punching people.

497
00:39:46,315 --> 00:39:47,716
Sister?

498
00:39:47,784 --> 00:39:50,569
First, William London
and now...

499
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:57,209
Never mind.
Well, come in, please.

500
00:39:57,277 --> 00:39:58,593
Sister.

501
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,949
Please. Sit.
Have a seat.

502
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:05,684
I actually have
a hot pot of tea.

503
00:40:05,752 --> 00:40:10,572
And close this, but not
quite for form's sake.

504
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,074
Father, would you care for a...

505
00:40:15,111 --> 00:40:17,412
Would you have
a cup of tea, Father?

506
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,215
I'd love a cup of tea.

507
00:40:19,282 --> 00:40:20,883
Sister, perhaps
you could serve him.

508
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,018
I'd be glad.

509
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:23,386
And yourself, of course.

510
00:40:23,453 --> 00:40:24,686
Would you like a cup of
tea, Sister Aloysius?

511
00:40:24,754 --> 00:40:26,522
No, I've already had my cup.

512
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:28,124
Is there sugar?

513
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:30,776
Sugar?

514
00:40:32,228 --> 00:40:38,767
Yes, yes. Somewhere here.

515
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:43,071
I put it in the drawer
for Lent last year.

516
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:44,740
Never remembered
to take it out.

517
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:46,809
It mustn't have been
much to give up, then.

518
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:52,381
I'm sure you're right.
Here it is.

519
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:59,088
I'll serve you, although for want
of practice I'm a little clumsy.

520
00:41:00,957 --> 00:41:02,758
I see your fingernails.

521
00:41:04,711 --> 00:41:06,628
Wear them a little long.

522
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,214
The sugar?
Yes. One?

523
00:41:09,282 --> 00:41:10,482
Three.

524
00:41:11,484 --> 00:41:13,418
Three?
Sweet tooth.

525
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:16,856
Two. Three.

526
00:41:18,024 --> 00:41:19,558
Sister, you care for sugar?

527
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,193
Never.

528
00:41:21,261 --> 00:41:24,246
Not that there's anything
wrong with sugar.

529
00:41:25,648 --> 00:41:28,517
Well, thank you, Father,
for making time for us.

530
00:41:28,585 --> 00:41:30,285
We are at our wit's end.

531
00:41:30,353 --> 00:41:34,572
I think it's an excellent idea to
rethink the Christmas pageant,

532
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,743
'cause last year's effort
was a little woebegone.

533
00:41:37,811 --> 00:41:41,714
Oh, I loved it, but I love all pageants.
The hymns.

534
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:45,200
<i>O Little Town of Bethlehem, O Come,
O Come, Emmanuel, O Come...</i>

535
00:41:45,268 --> 00:41:47,603
All right.
Thank you, Sister James.

536
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,037
So what do you think, Father?

537
00:41:49,105 --> 00:41:51,239
Is there
something new we could do?

538
00:41:51,307 --> 00:41:53,809
Well, we all love
the Christmas hymns,

539
00:41:53,877 --> 00:41:58,047
but it might be jolly
to include a secular song.

540
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:00,015
Secular?
Yes.

541
00:42:00,033 --> 00:42:03,168
<i>It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like
Christmas.</i> Something like that.

542
00:42:03,236 --> 00:42:06,839
What would be the point
of a secular song?

543
00:42:06,907 --> 00:42:08,140
Just fun.

544
00:42:08,207 --> 00:42:09,274
Or <i>Frosty the Snowman.</i>

545
00:42:09,342 --> 00:42:10,893
That's a good one.

546
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,847
We could have one of the boys dress
up as a snowman, dance around.

547
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:16,866
Which boy?

548
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:22,454
We'd do tryouts.

549
00:42:22,522 --> 00:42:27,125
<i>Frosty the Snowman espouses
a pagan belief in magic.</i>

550
00:42:27,194 --> 00:42:31,197
The snowman comes to life when an
enchanted hat is put on his head.

551
00:42:31,264 --> 00:42:32,964
If the music were more somber,

552
00:42:33,032 --> 00:42:38,020
people would realize the images are
disturbing and the song heretical.

553
00:42:38,087 --> 00:42:41,490
I never thought about <i>Frosty
the Snowman</i> like that.

554
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:42,758
It should be banned
from the airwaves.

555
00:42:42,825 --> 00:42:45,077
So, not <i>Frosty the Snowman.</i>

556
00:42:45,144 --> 00:42:51,116
Oh, <i>It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like
Christmas</i> would be fine, I suppose.

557
00:42:51,184 --> 00:42:53,118
Parents would like it.

558
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:59,391
May I ask what you're writing
down with that ballpoint pen?

559
00:42:59,459 --> 00:43:03,362
Oh, nothing.
It's an idea for a sermon.

560
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:04,863
Oh. You had one
right now?

561
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:07,249
I get them all the time.

562
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:09,084
How fortunate.

563
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,453
I forget them, so I have
to write them down.

564
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:12,838
Oh.

565
00:43:12,906 --> 00:43:14,689
What is the idea?

566
00:43:16,726 --> 00:43:18,194
Intolerance.

567
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,534
Would you like
a little more tea, Father?

568
00:43:25,601 --> 00:43:26,935
Not yet.

569
00:43:28,655 --> 00:43:30,973
It's a new time, Sister.

570
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,040
What's new about it?

571
00:43:32,108 --> 00:43:34,093
Something inside
of people is new.

572
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,828
There is nothing new
under the sun.

573
00:43:39,866 --> 00:43:43,001
The Church needs to change.

574
00:43:43,068 --> 00:43:45,937
We should sing a song
from the radio now and then,

575
00:43:46,005 --> 00:43:47,740
take the kids out
for ice cream.

576
00:43:47,807 --> 00:43:49,107
Sweet tooth.

577
00:43:49,175 --> 00:43:52,094
And maybe take the boys
on a camping trip.

578
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:53,846
The point being?

579
00:43:55,048 --> 00:43:57,733
We should be friendlier.

580
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,768
You know, the children
and the parents

581
00:43:59,836 --> 00:44:02,337
should see us
as members of their family.

582
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:07,526
But we are not members of their family.
We're different.

583
00:44:07,593 --> 00:44:10,195
Why?
Because of our vows?

584
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:13,481
Precisely.

585
00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:15,767
I don't think
we're so different.

586
00:44:15,835 --> 00:44:17,735
You know, Sister,
I would take some more tea.

587
00:44:17,803 --> 00:44:20,773
And they think
we're different, yeah?

588
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,474
The working...

589
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:28,079
The working class people of this
parish trust us to be different.

590
00:44:28,147 --> 00:44:29,648
I think we're getting
off the subject.

591
00:44:29,716 --> 00:44:31,316
Yes, you're right. You're right.
You're right. Back to it.

592
00:44:38,692 --> 00:44:40,058
Yes?

593
00:44:40,126 --> 00:44:43,862
Sister Raymond? Mmm.

594
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:48,049
Well, you tell her to wash her face and
her neck and report to me at 3:00.

595
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:49,501
Yeah.

596
00:44:51,103 --> 00:44:54,540
Excuse me.
The Christmas pageant.

597
00:44:55,608 --> 00:44:57,676
We must be careful

598
00:44:57,744 --> 00:44:59,494
how Donald Miller is used
in the pageant.

599
00:44:59,562 --> 00:45:01,045
Easy there, Sister.

600
00:45:01,113 --> 00:45:02,547
Father.

601
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:10,172
All right, what about
Donald Miller?

602
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,357
We must be careful,
in the pageant,

603
00:45:12,425 --> 00:45:16,562
that we neither hide Donald
Miller nor put him forward.

604
00:45:19,899 --> 00:45:21,499
Because of the color
of his skin?

605
00:45:21,567 --> 00:45:23,318
That's right, yeah.

606
00:45:23,385 --> 00:45:24,903
Why?

607
00:45:25,771 --> 00:45:27,139
Oh, come, Father.

608
00:45:27,206 --> 00:45:31,309
I think he should be treated
like every other boy.

609
00:45:31,377 --> 00:45:35,647
Well, you yourself singled the
boy out for special attention.

610
00:45:38,084 --> 00:45:43,538
You held a private meeting with
him at the rectory. A week ago?

611
00:45:43,606 --> 00:45:44,974
Yes.

612
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:50,862
What are we talking about?

613
00:45:51,431 --> 00:45:52,881
Donald Miller.

614
00:45:56,486 --> 00:45:59,821
The boy acted strangely
when he returned to class.

615
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:02,941
He did?

616
00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:06,478
When he returned from the
rectory, a little odd, yes.

617
00:46:07,013 --> 00:46:08,813
Can you tell us why?

618
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:13,017
How did he act strangely?

619
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:14,869
He...

620
00:46:16,105 --> 00:46:18,973
I'm not sure how to explain it.

621
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:21,476
He laid his head
on the desk and...

622
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:26,615
Do you mean
you had some impression?

623
00:46:26,682 --> 00:46:28,116
Yes.

624
00:46:28,184 --> 00:46:30,418
And he'd come from the
rectory, so you're asking me?

625
00:46:30,486 --> 00:46:31,804
Mmm. That's it.

626
00:46:32,538 --> 00:46:33,906
Hmm.

627
00:46:33,973 --> 00:46:35,140
Mmm.

628
00:46:35,842 --> 00:46:36,741
Mmm.

629
00:46:38,411 --> 00:46:40,378
Did you want to discuss the pageant?
Is that why I'm here?

630
00:46:40,446 --> 00:46:42,431
Or is this what
you wanted to discuss?

631
00:46:43,148 --> 00:46:44,266
This.

632
00:46:45,918 --> 00:46:48,836
Well, I'm a little
uncomfortable.

633
00:46:48,904 --> 00:46:50,021
Why?

634
00:46:50,089 --> 00:46:51,890
Why do you think?

635
00:46:51,957 --> 00:46:54,159
The boy's well-being
is my responsibility.

636
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:57,579
His well-being
is not at issue.

637
00:46:57,647 --> 00:47:01,065
I'm not satisfied
that that is true.

638
00:47:01,133 --> 00:47:04,887
He was upset
when he returned to class.

639
00:47:04,954 --> 00:47:06,521
Did he say something?

640
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:07,556
No.

641
00:47:09,242 --> 00:47:10,859
What happened in the rectory?

642
00:47:12,345 --> 00:47:13,495
Happened?

643
00:47:13,513 --> 00:47:14,880
Mmm.

644
00:47:14,948 --> 00:47:16,364
Nothing happened.
I had a talk with the boy.

645
00:47:16,432 --> 00:47:17,699
What about?

646
00:47:17,766 --> 00:47:18,934
Private matter.

647
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:22,187
He's 12 years old.
What could be private?

648
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:26,341
- Should I get...
- No.

649
00:47:27,777 --> 00:47:30,279
I object to your tone.

650
00:47:30,346 --> 00:47:36,417
This is not about my tone
or your tone, Father Flynn.

651
00:47:39,021 --> 00:47:40,989
It's about
arriving at the truth.

652
00:47:41,056 --> 00:47:42,557
Of what?

653
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:48,230
You know what I'm talking
about, don't you?

654
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:53,017
And you're controlling the expression
on your face right now, aren't you?

655
00:47:53,085 --> 00:47:54,485
My face?

656
00:47:57,023 --> 00:47:58,556
What exactly
are you accusing me of?

657
00:47:58,624 --> 00:48:01,325
I'm not accusing you
of anything, Father Flynn.

658
00:48:01,393 --> 00:48:07,031
I am asking you to tell me
what happened in the rectory.

659
00:48:13,522 --> 00:48:16,875
I don't wish to continue this.

660
00:48:16,942 --> 00:48:18,393
And if you're
dissatisfied with that,

661
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:22,497
I suggest you speak
to Monsignor Benedict.

662
00:48:22,564 --> 00:48:26,918
I can only imagine this unfortunate
behavior is the result of overwork.

663
00:48:28,187 --> 00:48:31,055
Have a good morning,
Sister. Sister.

664
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:40,599
There was alcohol on his breath

665
00:48:42,551 --> 00:48:45,520
when he returned
from his meeting with you.

666
00:48:49,508 --> 00:48:50,758
Alcohol?

667
00:48:52,678 --> 00:48:54,946
I did smell it on his breath.

668
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:01,753
Well?

669
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,692
Let this alone.
No.

670
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:20,973
Take your time, Father.
Would you like some more tea?

671
00:49:22,374 --> 00:49:24,526
You should've let it alone.

672
00:49:26,446 --> 00:49:27,946
Not possible.

673
00:49:36,138 --> 00:49:39,274
Mr. McGuinn caught Donald
drinking altar wine.

674
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:47,849
When I found out, I sent for him.
There were tears,

675
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:53,888
and he begged not to be removed from
the altar boys. I took pity on him.

676
00:49:53,956 --> 00:49:57,242
I told him if no one else found
out, I'd let him stay on.

677
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:01,096
What a relief. That explains
everything. Thanks be to God.

678
00:50:01,163 --> 00:50:04,165
Look, Sister,
it was all a mistake.

679
00:50:08,671 --> 00:50:10,606
And if I talk to
Mr. McGuinn?

680
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:12,924
Talk to him, by all means.

681
00:50:12,992 --> 00:50:14,359
But now that
the boy's secret's out,

682
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:15,961
I'm gonna have to remove
him from the altar boys.

683
00:50:16,028 --> 00:50:17,528
That's what
I was trying to avoid.

684
00:50:17,596 --> 00:50:19,064
You were trying
to protect the boy.

685
00:50:19,131 --> 00:50:21,098
That's right.

686
00:50:21,166 --> 00:50:23,684
I might have done
the same thing.

687
00:50:23,752 --> 00:50:26,304
Is there a way Donald could
stay on the altar boys?

688
00:50:26,455 --> 00:50:30,525
If the boy drank altar wine, he
can't continue as an altar boy.

689
00:50:30,592 --> 00:50:31,993
Of course.

690
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:36,414
Are you satisfied?

691
00:50:36,982 --> 00:50:37,983
Yes.

692
00:50:41,036 --> 00:50:43,038
Hmm.

693
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,774
Well, I'll be going.
I have some writing to do.

694
00:50:47,042 --> 00:50:48,493
Intolerance.

695
00:50:48,561 --> 00:50:50,161
That's right.

696
00:50:51,864 --> 00:50:54,933
I'm not pleased
with how you handled this.

697
00:50:55,735 --> 00:50:57,568
Sister. Sister.

698
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:07,629
Well...

699
00:51:09,732 --> 00:51:12,467
What a relief.
He cleared it all up.

700
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,055
You believe him?

701
00:51:19,258 --> 00:51:20,759
Of course.

702
00:51:22,878 --> 00:51:25,981
Isn't it that it's easier
to believe him?

703
00:51:26,048 --> 00:51:28,350
But we can corroborate his
story with Mr. McGuinn.

704
00:51:28,417 --> 00:51:29,650
Mmm-hmm.

705
00:51:30,386 --> 00:51:31,552
Yes.

706
00:51:33,322 --> 00:51:35,741
These types of people
are clever.

707
00:51:39,578 --> 00:51:41,646
Well, I'm convinced.

708
00:51:41,648 --> 00:51:43,281
You're not.

709
00:51:43,348 --> 00:51:47,369
You just want things to be resolved
so you can have simplicity back.

710
00:51:48,721 --> 00:51:50,805
I want no further part of this.

711
00:51:52,324 --> 00:51:54,075
I'll bring him down.

712
00:51:55,795 --> 00:51:58,730
How can you be so sure
that he is lying?

713
00:52:02,584 --> 00:52:04,035
Experience.

714
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:09,391
You just don't like him.

715
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:12,844
You don't like it that
he uses a ballpoint pen.

716
00:52:12,912 --> 00:52:16,414
You don't like it that he takes
three lumps of sugar in his tea.

717
00:52:16,482 --> 00:52:18,683
You don't like it that he
likes <i>Frosty the Snowman,</i>

718
00:52:18,751 --> 00:52:23,555
and you are letting that convince you
of something terrible, just terrible.

719
00:52:25,007 --> 00:52:28,092
Well, I like
<i>Frosty the Snowman!</i>

720
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:30,495
And I think it would be nice if this
school weren't run like a jail,

721
00:52:30,663 --> 00:52:32,897
and I think it's a good thing
that I love to teach history

722
00:52:32,965 --> 00:52:35,133
and that I might inspire
my students to love it, too.

723
00:52:35,201 --> 00:52:38,185
And if you judge that to mean that
I am not fit to be a teacher,

724
00:52:38,253 --> 00:52:39,921
then so be it!

725
00:52:43,476 --> 00:52:44,909
Sit down.

726
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:57,672
Look at that.
You blew out my light.

727
00:53:01,294 --> 00:53:02,761
In ancient Sparta,

728
00:53:02,828 --> 00:53:06,514
important matters were decided
by who shouted loudest.

729
00:53:06,582 --> 00:53:09,734
Fortunately, we are not
in ancient Sparta.

730
00:53:15,991 --> 00:53:17,942
You honestly find
the students in this school

731
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:21,763
to be treated like
inmates in a prison?

732
00:53:22,865 --> 00:53:24,799
No.

733
00:53:24,867 --> 00:53:29,954
Actually, they all seem fairly happy, but
they're all uniformly terrified of you.

734
00:53:31,691 --> 00:53:34,643
Yes.
That's how it works.

735
00:53:36,211 --> 00:53:37,679
Sit there.

736
00:53:53,512 --> 00:53:55,513
Hello, this is
Sister Aloysius Beauvier,

737
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:59,167
principal at St. Nicholas School.
Is this Mrs. Miller?

738
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,922
I'm calling about
your son, Donald.

739
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:22,707
<i>A woman was gossiping with a
friend about a man she hardly knew.</i>

740
00:54:22,775 --> 00:54:24,409
<i>I know none of you
have ever done this.</i>

741
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:29,197
<i>That night she had a dream.</i>

742
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:35,136
<i>A great hand appeared over
her and pointed down at her.</i>

743
00:54:35,204 --> 00:54:40,342
<i>She was immediately seized with
an overwhelming sense of guilt.</i>

744
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:43,011
<i>The next day she
went to confession.</i>

745
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:46,114
<i>She got the old parish
priest, Father O'Rourke.</i>

746
00:54:47,216 --> 00:54:49,984
<i>She told him the whole thing.</i>

747
00:54:50,052 --> 00:54:54,822
<i>"Is gossiping a sin?"
she asked the old man.</i>

748
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:58,994
<i>"Was that the hand of God
Almighty pointing a finger at me?</i>

749
00:54:59,061 --> 00:55:01,846
<i>"Should I be asking your
absolution, Father?</i>

750
00:55:01,913 --> 00:55:05,683
<i>"Tell me, have I done
something wrong?"</i>

751
00:55:05,751 --> 00:55:07,685
<i>"Yes."</i>

752
00:55:07,753 --> 00:55:09,337
<i>Father O'Rourke answered her.</i>

753
00:55:09,404 --> 00:55:14,391
<i>"Yes, you ignorant,
badly brought up female.</i>

754
00:55:14,459 --> 00:55:17,361
<i>"You have borne false witness
against your neighbor.</i>

755
00:55:17,429 --> 00:55:20,365
<i>"You have played fast and
loose with his reputation,</i>

756
00:55:20,432 --> 00:55:24,785
<i>"and you should be
heartily ashamed!"</i>

757
00:55:24,853 --> 00:55:30,541
<i>So the woman said she was sorry
and asked for forgiveness.</i>

758
00:55:30,609 --> 00:55:34,095
<i>"Not so fast," says O'Rourke.</i>

759
00:55:34,163 --> 00:55:38,767
<i>"I want you to go home.
Take a pillow up on your roof,</i>

760
00:55:38,834 --> 00:55:42,637
<i>"cut it open with a knife,
and return here to me."</i>

761
00:55:44,657 --> 00:55:48,576
<i>So the woman went home,
took a pillow off her bed,</i>

762
00:55:48,644 --> 00:55:50,244
<i>a knife from the drawer,</i>

763
00:55:50,312 --> 00:55:54,432
<i>went up the fire escape to her
roof and stabbed the pillow.</i>

764
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,935
<i>Then she went back to the old
parish priest as instructed.</i>

765
00:55:58,003 --> 00:56:02,106
<i>"Did you gut the pillow
with a knife?" he says.</i>

766
00:56:02,174 --> 00:56:05,677
<i>"Yes, Father."
"And what was the result?"</i>

767
00:56:07,146 --> 00:56:09,714
<i>"Feathers," she said.</i>

768
00:56:13,652 --> 00:56:15,786
<i>"Feathers," he repeated.</i>

769
00:56:19,058 --> 00:56:21,459
<i>"Feathers everywhere, Father."</i>

770
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:27,315
<i>"Now, I want you to go back</i>

771
00:56:27,382 --> 00:56:32,237
<i>"and gather up every last feather
that flew out on the wind."</i>

772
00:56:32,304 --> 00:56:37,325
<i>"Well," she said,
"it can't be done.</i>

773
00:56:37,392 --> 00:56:41,312
<i>"I don't know where they went.
The wind took them all over."</i>

774
00:56:43,148 --> 00:56:47,535
<i>"And that," said Father
O'Rourke, "is gossip!"</i>

775
00:56:50,055 --> 00:56:54,125
<i>In the name of the Father, the
Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.</i>

776
00:56:58,564 --> 00:57:00,065
<i>Please rise.</i>

777
00:57:32,164 --> 00:57:34,816
What's that bird
complaining about?

778
00:57:37,102 --> 00:57:39,304
What kind of bird is that?

779
00:57:39,371 --> 00:57:42,257
That a starling?
A grackle?

780
00:57:45,194 --> 00:57:46,728
A crow.

781
00:57:47,212 --> 00:57:49,446
Course it is.

782
00:57:49,514 --> 00:57:51,749
Are you praying?
I didn't mean to interrupt.

783
00:57:51,751 --> 00:57:53,735
I'm not praying.
No.

784
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:57,322
You seem subdued.

785
00:57:58,607 --> 00:58:01,392
Oh, I can't sleep.

786
00:58:02,577 --> 00:58:03,911
Why not?

787
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:07,598
Bad dreams.

788
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:11,102
Yeah, I can't sleep
on occasion.

789
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:15,172
Why? Do you see that big hand
pointing a finger at you?

790
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,824
Yes. Sometimes.

791
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:23,698
Was your sermon directed
at anyone in particular?

792
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,551
What do you think?

793
00:58:38,297 --> 00:58:42,766
I received a letter from
my brother in Maryland.

794
00:58:43,768 --> 00:58:45,303
He's very sick.

795
00:58:47,356 --> 00:58:49,641
Then maybe you should
go and see him.

796
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:51,776
I can't leave my class.

797
00:59:00,653 --> 00:59:02,220
Is it true?

798
00:59:04,306 --> 00:59:05,523
What?

799
00:59:07,009 --> 00:59:09,277
You know what I'm asking.

800
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:12,447
No.

801
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:19,170
I saw you put an undershirt
in Donald Miller's locker.

802
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,040
He left it in the sacristy.

803
00:59:23,108 --> 00:59:25,459
Why didn't you hand it to him?

804
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:32,283
I'm trying to spare him
further embarrassment.

805
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:51,268
It's me that cares about
that child, not her.

806
00:59:52,704 --> 00:59:55,206
Has she ever
reached out a hand?

807
00:59:57,092 --> 01:00:00,961
That black boy needs help
or he's not gonna make it.

808
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,947
If she has her way, he'll
be left to his own undoing.

809
01:00:03,014 --> 01:00:06,467
Why do you think he drank the wine?
He's in trouble.

810
01:00:09,738 --> 01:00:12,006
And she sees me talk in a
human way to these kids

811
01:00:12,074 --> 01:00:17,145
and she immediately assumes that there
must be something wrong with it.

812
01:00:17,212 --> 01:00:20,398
Well, I'm not gonna let her keep
this parish in the Dark Ages,

813
01:00:20,466 --> 01:00:24,018
and I'm not gonna let her destroy
my spirit of compassion.

814
01:00:24,086 --> 01:00:25,653
I'm sure that's not her intent.

815
01:00:25,721 --> 01:00:27,722
That I care about
this congregation.

816
01:00:27,789 --> 01:00:29,657
I know you do.

817
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:34,345
Like you care about your class.
You love them, don't you?

818
01:00:35,797 --> 01:00:38,616
Yes.
And that's natural.

819
01:00:38,684 --> 01:00:41,402
How else would
you relate to children?

820
01:00:44,289 --> 01:00:48,259
Now, I can look at your face
and know your philosophy.

821
01:00:48,326 --> 01:00:50,711
It's kindness.

822
01:00:50,779 --> 01:00:53,848
I don't know.
I mean, of course.

823
01:00:56,084 --> 01:01:00,338
There are people who go after
your humanity, Sister,

824
01:01:00,405 --> 01:01:02,707
that tell you that the light
in your heart is a weakness.

825
01:01:02,774 --> 01:01:05,760
Don't believe it.

826
01:01:05,827 --> 01:01:10,882
It's an old tactic of cruel people to
kill kindness in the name of virtue.

827
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:15,687
There's nothing wrong
with love.

828
01:01:18,473 --> 01:01:19,657
Love?

829
01:01:21,493 --> 01:01:24,612
Have you forgotten the
message of our Savior?

830
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:27,949
It's love of people.

831
01:01:37,342 --> 01:01:40,361
I just feel as if
everything is upside down.

832
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:49,537
There are just times in life
when we feel lost. It happens.

833
01:01:52,474 --> 01:01:54,308
And it's a bond.

834
01:01:59,414 --> 01:02:00,814
Flowers.
Yeah.

835
01:02:01,767 --> 01:02:03,834
To remind me of spring.

836
01:02:13,245 --> 01:02:15,045
I should be going.

837
01:02:18,116 --> 01:02:20,551
I'm sorry your brother's ill.

838
01:02:22,237 --> 01:02:24,054
Thank you, Father.

839
01:02:30,145 --> 01:02:31,929
I don't believe it.

840
01:02:33,932 --> 01:02:35,449
You don't?

841
01:02:37,486 --> 01:02:38,669
No.

842
01:02:40,155 --> 01:02:42,940
Thank you, Sister.
Thank you very much.

843
01:02:54,502 --> 01:02:56,137
- Hey, Anthony!
- That's not funny.

844
01:02:56,204 --> 01:02:58,472
That's also the day
that I tripped. I broke my ankle.

845
01:02:58,540 --> 01:02:59,840
I barely...

846
01:02:59,908 --> 01:03:02,976
Father. I think I've just
gotta tell somebody.

847
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:04,045
Hello, Noreen.

848
01:03:04,112 --> 01:03:06,414
I'm in love.

849
01:03:06,481 --> 01:03:08,682
That's wonderful.
Who's the lucky boy?

850
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:09,850
Jimmy Hurley.

851
01:03:09,918 --> 01:03:11,485
Have you told him?

852
01:03:11,553 --> 01:03:13,470
For life and death,
I'd go for waffles.

853
01:03:13,538 --> 01:03:15,138
Maybe you should.

854
01:03:16,158 --> 01:03:17,691
Maybe I will, Father.

855
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:20,411
Jimmy!

856
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,047
Jimmy Hurley?

857
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:25,983
Come over here!

858
01:03:28,887 --> 01:03:31,005
Hurry up, already!

859
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:32,606
Father Sherman.

860
01:03:34,192 --> 01:03:36,426
Jimmy, I just
gotta tell you something.

861
01:03:42,617 --> 01:03:43,851
You dropped
something.

862
01:03:45,053 --> 01:03:46,253
It's not funny.

863
01:03:46,321 --> 01:03:47,521
Get out of the way.

864
01:04:01,703 --> 01:04:03,337
It's all right.

865
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:05,589
He doesn't like me.

866
01:04:05,657 --> 01:04:07,108
That is so easy!

867
01:04:11,196 --> 01:04:13,514
My parents are
gonna be so angry at me.

868
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:24,492
Okay. Be quiet.

869
01:04:27,345 --> 01:04:30,915
I said be quiet!

870
01:04:30,983 --> 01:04:34,652
The next one of you that speaks out of
turn gets sent right to the principal.

871
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,238
Now the question was,

872
01:04:37,305 --> 01:04:40,341
what was Patrick
Henry's famous remark?

873
01:04:44,346 --> 01:04:45,496
Donald.

874
01:04:45,564 --> 01:04:46,731
Sister?

875
01:04:51,503 --> 01:04:53,270
What was the question?

876
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:57,724
Nobody help him.
Jimmy, put your hand down.

877
01:04:58,593 --> 01:05:00,644
Donald Miller, stand up.

878
01:05:06,101 --> 01:05:08,452
What was the question, Donald?

879
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,737
I don't know, Sister.

880
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:14,007
It means you weren't listening.

881
01:05:14,075 --> 01:05:16,277
Yes, Sister.

882
01:05:16,294 --> 01:05:20,348
The question was, what was
Patrick Henry's famous remark?

883
01:05:24,269 --> 01:05:25,719
I don't know.

884
01:05:25,787 --> 01:05:27,171
"Give me liberty
or give me death!"

885
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:30,041
James Hurley, down to
the principal's office.

886
01:05:30,108 --> 01:05:31,275
Now!

887
01:05:55,383 --> 01:05:56,500
Mrs. Miller?

888
01:05:56,567 --> 01:05:57,668
Yes.

889
01:05:57,736 --> 01:05:59,069
Come in.

890
01:06:00,972 --> 01:06:02,906
Please, have a seat.

891
01:06:06,895 --> 01:06:10,064
I was changing a bulb.

892
01:06:10,131 --> 01:06:13,034
Thought I mighta had the wrong day.
You didn't answer.

893
01:06:13,036 --> 01:06:14,101
Huh?

894
01:06:14,169 --> 01:06:17,504
Oh, well, just between us,

895
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:22,743
I was listening to a transistor
radio with an earpiece.

896
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:25,296
Look how tiny
they're making them.

897
01:06:25,363 --> 01:06:27,248
I confiscated it from
one of the students,

898
01:06:27,315 --> 01:06:29,082
now I can't stop
listening to it.

899
01:06:29,951 --> 01:06:31,585
You like music?

900
01:06:33,688 --> 01:06:36,356
No. News reports.

901
01:06:36,424 --> 01:06:38,976
Years ago I used to listen
to all the news reports,

902
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:42,146
because my husband was
in Italy, in the war.

903
01:06:42,214 --> 01:06:44,331
You were a married woman?

904
01:06:44,399 --> 01:06:46,067
Yes.

905
01:06:46,134 --> 01:06:48,118
But then he was killed.

906
01:06:49,554 --> 01:06:50,921
Is your husband coming?

907
01:06:50,988 --> 01:06:53,624
Couldn't get off work.
I only have half an hour myself.

908
01:06:53,691 --> 01:06:56,760
I see. Of course.
It was a lot to ask.

909
01:07:06,171 --> 01:07:08,655
How's Donald doing?

910
01:07:08,723 --> 01:07:12,192
He's passing his subjects.
He has average grades.

911
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:15,229
Oh. Good.

912
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:18,048
He was upset about getting
taken off the altar boys.

913
01:07:18,115 --> 01:07:20,351
Mmm. Did he explain why?

914
01:07:20,385 --> 01:07:23,204
He said he was caught
drinking altar wine.

915
01:07:23,271 --> 01:07:25,556
That is the reason.

916
01:07:25,623 --> 01:07:28,325
Well, that seems fair.

917
01:07:29,961 --> 01:07:31,678
But he's a good boy, Sister.
He fell down there,

918
01:07:31,746 --> 01:07:34,497
but he's a good boy
pretty much down the line.

919
01:07:34,565 --> 01:07:36,550
How is he at home?

920
01:07:38,186 --> 01:07:40,454
His father beat the hell
out of him over that wine.

921
01:07:40,522 --> 01:07:42,055
Oh, he shouldn't do that.

922
01:07:42,123 --> 01:07:46,661
You don't tell my husband what to do.
You just stand back.

923
01:07:46,728 --> 01:07:50,264
My husband didn't want
Donald to come here.

924
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:51,916
Why?
He thought he'd have trouble

925
01:07:51,983 --> 01:07:55,385
with the other boys, but
that hasn't really happened.

926
01:07:55,453 --> 01:07:57,088
Good.

927
01:07:57,090 --> 01:08:00,658
That priest, Father Flynn,
been watching out for him.

928
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,160
Yes.

929
01:08:11,369 --> 01:08:13,086
Excuse me.

930
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:23,998
James Hurley, what are
you doing out of class?

931
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:25,106
Sister James sent me down.

932
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:26,199
What for?

933
01:08:26,267 --> 01:08:27,467
Talking.

934
01:08:27,535 --> 01:08:29,186
Well, go back up and shut up!

935
01:08:30,422 --> 01:08:31,722
Go! Go!

936
01:08:36,027 --> 01:08:37,811
What's going on?

937
01:08:42,684 --> 01:08:46,103
None of your business.
Now go on. Go back to class.

938
01:08:46,888 --> 01:08:48,438
Bullshit.

939
01:08:48,506 --> 01:08:49,640
What'd you say?

940
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:50,941
Nothing!

941
01:08:57,549 --> 01:08:58,849
You have 20 minutes, you say?

942
01:09:00,284 --> 01:09:03,070
It's just that I have
to walk to work.

943
01:09:03,137 --> 01:09:04,171
Where is work?

944
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:05,873
Parkchester.

945
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:09,093
If I don't start cleaning by noon,
I'm not home to let Donald in.

946
01:09:09,161 --> 01:09:11,011
May I walk with you?

947
01:09:11,546 --> 01:09:13,063
I don't mind.

948
01:09:15,433 --> 01:09:18,269
Eight sixty-fourths.

949
01:09:18,336 --> 01:09:21,555
Who can tell me what the
common denominator is?

950
01:09:21,623 --> 01:09:22,973
Nobody?

951
01:09:24,826 --> 01:09:27,695
Back already,
Mr. Hurley?

952
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:29,563
I said, back already,
Mr. Hurley?

953
01:09:29,631 --> 01:09:31,615
Leave me alone!

954
01:09:31,683 --> 01:09:34,067
Who do you think
you're talking to?

955
01:09:34,135 --> 01:09:37,638
This is my classroom, boy!
Don't you forget that.

956
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,477
I'm sorry.

957
01:09:49,867 --> 01:09:52,570
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

958
01:09:56,357 --> 01:09:58,592
Have you met
Father Flynn?

959
01:09:58,743 --> 01:09:59,843
Just seen him on the altar.

960
01:09:59,911 --> 01:10:01,144
Haven't met him face to face.

961
01:10:01,213 --> 01:10:03,681
No, just, you know,
heard from Donald.

962
01:10:03,748 --> 01:10:05,148
And what does he say?

963
01:10:05,217 --> 01:10:07,918
You know, "Father
Flynn, Father Flynn."

964
01:10:07,985 --> 01:10:10,754
He looks up to him. Man gives him his
time, which is what the boy needs.

965
01:10:10,822 --> 01:10:12,789
He needs that.

966
01:10:12,857 --> 01:10:16,727
Mrs. Miller, we may
have a problem.

967
01:10:16,794 --> 01:10:18,813
I thought there must a been a
reason you wanting to see me.

968
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,615
Principal's a big job.

969
01:10:21,683 --> 01:10:24,952
I just want to say though,
it's just till June.

970
01:10:25,019 --> 01:10:26,453
Excuse me?

971
01:10:28,222 --> 01:10:32,025
Whatever the problem is, Donald
just has to make it till June.

972
01:10:32,093 --> 01:10:34,411
Then he's off into high school.

973
01:10:34,478 --> 01:10:36,329
Right.

974
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:38,315
If Donald can graduate
from St. Nicholas,

975
01:10:38,383 --> 01:10:41,184
he has a better chance of getting
into a good high school,

976
01:10:41,252 --> 01:10:45,322
and that would mean an
opportunity at college.

977
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:47,157
I don't see anything
at this time

978
01:10:47,225 --> 01:10:50,760
standing in the way of his
graduating with his class.

979
01:10:51,796 --> 01:10:53,530
Well, that's all I care about.

980
01:10:53,597 --> 01:10:54,965
I doubt that.

981
01:10:55,533 --> 01:10:56,800
Try me.

982
01:10:59,554 --> 01:11:04,391
I am concerned about the relationship
between Father Flynn and your son.

983
01:11:04,459 --> 01:11:08,128
You don't say. Concerned.
What do you mean, concerned?

984
01:11:08,196 --> 01:11:10,297
That it may not be right.

985
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:13,500
Well, there's something
wrong with everybody,

986
01:11:13,568 --> 01:11:17,371
and their soul gotta be forgiven.
I work right there.

987
01:11:17,438 --> 01:11:20,407
I am concerned, to be frank,

988
01:11:23,744 --> 01:11:27,714
that Father Flynn may have
made advances on your son.

989
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,420
May have made?

990
01:11:34,222 --> 01:11:35,989
I can't be certain.

991
01:11:36,057 --> 01:11:37,123
No evidence?

992
01:11:37,191 --> 01:11:38,925
No.

993
01:11:38,993 --> 01:11:41,562
Then maybe
there's nothing to it.

994
01:11:49,003 --> 01:11:52,172
I think there is
something to it.

995
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:54,942
I think Father Flynn gave
Donald that altar wine.

996
01:11:55,009 --> 01:11:57,177
Why would he do that?

997
01:12:00,247 --> 01:12:02,449
Has Donald been
acting strangely?

998
01:12:02,516 --> 01:12:03,584
No.

999
01:12:03,651 --> 01:12:04,772
Nothing out of the ordinary?

1000
01:12:04,819 --> 01:12:06,053
He's been himself.

1001
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,287
All right.

1002
01:12:07,354 --> 01:12:08,889
Look, Sister, I don't
want any trouble.

1003
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:11,257
I don't... I'm not sure
you completely understand.

1004
01:12:11,325 --> 01:12:13,293
I think I understand the kind
of thing you're talking about,

1005
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,029
but I don't want
to get into it.

1006
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:17,598
What's that?

1007
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:22,603
Look, I only have a few minutes.
Not to be disagreeing,

1008
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:25,539
but if we're talking about
something floating around

1009
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:28,042
between this priest and my
son, it ain't my son's fault.

1010
01:12:28,109 --> 01:12:29,409
I'm not suggesting that...

1011
01:12:29,477 --> 01:12:30,711
He's just a boy.

1012
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:32,279
I know.
Twelve years old.

1013
01:12:32,346 --> 01:12:33,747
If someone should be taking
blame, it should be the man...

1014
01:12:33,815 --> 01:12:34,882
I know. I agree
with you completely.

1015
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,016
not the boy.

1016
01:12:36,084 --> 01:12:37,451
You're agreeing with me,
but I got called

1017
01:12:37,518 --> 01:12:38,619
to the principal, if you
know what I'm saying.

1018
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:41,989
I am concerned about
Donald's welfare.

1019
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:46,259
You honestly think that priest
gave Donald that wine to drink?

1020
01:12:46,327 --> 01:12:47,728
Yes, I do.

1021
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:50,230
Then how come my son got
kicked off the altar boys

1022
01:12:50,298 --> 01:12:51,531
if it was a man
that gave it to him?

1023
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,633
I know.

1024
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:55,202
The boy got caught,
the man didn't.

1025
01:12:57,722 --> 01:12:59,156
So you're giving my son the blame.
No.

1026
01:12:59,223 --> 01:13:00,691
No problem my son
getting blamed,

1027
01:13:00,758 --> 01:13:02,258
and you know why that is.
Perhaps you should let me talk.

1028
01:13:02,326 --> 01:13:03,493
I think you're getting upset.

1029
01:13:03,561 --> 01:13:04,801
Sister, you ain't going against

1030
01:13:04,829 --> 01:13:05,896
no man in a robe and win.
He's got the position.

1031
01:13:05,963 --> 01:13:07,497
And he's got your son.

1032
01:13:07,565 --> 01:13:09,166
Let him have him then.

1033
01:13:11,452 --> 01:13:12,736
What?

1034
01:13:14,905 --> 01:13:16,806
It's just till June.

1035
01:13:18,893 --> 01:13:21,445
Do you know what you're saying?

1036
01:13:22,363 --> 01:13:24,581
Know more about it than you.

1037
01:13:26,467 --> 01:13:29,936
I believe this man is creating,

1038
01:13:30,004 --> 01:13:32,139
or may have already
brought about,

1039
01:13:32,206 --> 01:13:34,675
an improper relationship
with your son.

1040
01:13:34,742 --> 01:13:36,576
I don't know.

1041
01:13:36,644 --> 01:13:38,211
I know I am right.

1042
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:42,349
Why you gotta know something like
that for sure when you don't?

1043
01:13:43,418 --> 01:13:45,719
What kind of mother are you?

1044
01:13:49,424 --> 01:13:52,459
Excuse me, but you don't know enough about
life to say a thing like that, Sister.

1045
01:13:52,527 --> 01:13:53,760
I know enough.

1046
01:13:53,828 --> 01:13:55,629
You know the rules maybe,
but that don't cover it.

1047
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:57,597
I know what I won't accept.

1048
01:13:57,665 --> 01:13:59,800
You accept what you gotta
accept, and you work with it.

1049
01:13:59,867 --> 01:14:01,000
This man is in my school.

1050
01:14:01,068 --> 01:14:02,369
Well, he's gotta be
somewhere and

1051
01:14:02,437 --> 01:14:03,970
maybe he's doing some good, too.
He is after the boys!

1052
01:14:04,038 --> 01:14:07,140
Well, maybe some of them
boys want to get caught!

1053
01:14:19,437 --> 01:14:21,805
That's why his father beat him.

1054
01:14:25,443 --> 01:14:26,977
Not the wine.

1055
01:14:35,203 --> 01:14:37,270
What are you telling me?

1056
01:14:41,592 --> 01:14:44,428
I'm talking about
the boy's nature now,

1057
01:14:45,796 --> 01:14:47,897
not anything he's done.

1058
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,736
You can't hold a child responsible
for what God gave him to be.

1059
01:14:56,307 --> 01:14:59,476
I'm only interested
in actions, Mrs. Miller.

1060
01:14:59,543 --> 01:15:01,461
But then there's
the boy's nature.

1061
01:15:01,529 --> 01:15:02,846
Leave that out of it.

1062
01:15:02,913 --> 01:15:04,614
Well, forget it then.

1063
01:15:06,016 --> 01:15:09,086
You're the one forcing
people to say things.

1064
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,040
My boy came to your school

1065
01:15:14,108 --> 01:15:17,243
'cause they were gonna kill
him in the public school.

1066
01:15:20,147 --> 01:15:22,783
His father don't like him.

1067
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:26,503
He come to your school,
kids don't like him.

1068
01:15:26,571 --> 01:15:30,140
One man is good to him,
this priest.

1069
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:33,010
Then does a man
have his reasons, yes.

1070
01:15:34,145 --> 01:15:37,314
Everybody does.
You have your reasons,

1071
01:15:38,515 --> 01:15:41,651
but do I ask the man
why he's good to my son?

1072
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:44,787
No.

1073
01:15:48,559 --> 01:15:50,327
I don't care why.

1074
01:15:53,798 --> 01:15:58,551
My son needs some man
to care about him

1075
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:03,389
and to see him through
to where he wants to go.

1076
01:16:03,457 --> 01:16:05,658
And thank God this educated man

1077
01:16:05,726 --> 01:16:08,478
with some kindness in him
wants to do just that.

1078
01:16:08,546 --> 01:16:10,163
This will not do.

1079
01:16:10,231 --> 01:16:11,397
It's just till June.

1080
01:16:11,465 --> 01:16:13,400
I'll throw your son
out of this school.

1081
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:15,668
And why would you do that
if it didn't start with him?

1082
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:18,121
Because I will stop this.

1083
01:16:18,189 --> 01:16:20,140
You'd hurt my son
to get your way?

1084
01:16:20,207 --> 01:16:21,674
It won't end with your son.

1085
01:16:21,742 --> 01:16:22,992
Throw the priest out then.

1086
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:25,462
I am trying to do just that.

1087
01:16:25,529 --> 01:16:27,731
Then what do you want from me?

1088
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:36,189
Nothing.

1089
01:16:40,494 --> 01:16:43,196
As it turns out.

1090
01:16:43,264 --> 01:16:46,166
Please leave my son out of this.

1091
01:16:54,291 --> 01:16:57,994
My husband will kill that
child over a thing like this.

1092
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,888
I will try.

1093
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:20,283
I'm late.

1094
01:17:22,987 --> 01:17:24,287
Sister,

1095
01:17:27,124 --> 01:17:31,011
I don't know if you and me
on the same side.

1096
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:35,682
I'll be standing with my son and
those who are good with my son.

1097
01:17:35,749 --> 01:17:39,286
It'd be nice to see you there.
Good morning.

1098
01:18:58,315 --> 01:19:00,483
May I come in?

1099
01:19:00,551 --> 01:19:02,285
A third party
would be required.

1100
01:19:02,353 --> 01:19:05,305
Yeah. What was Donald's
mother doing here?

1101
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,274
We were having a chat.

1102
01:19:07,341 --> 01:19:08,608
About what?

1103
01:19:08,626 --> 01:19:10,126
A third party would truly
be required, Father.

1104
01:19:10,194 --> 01:19:11,994
No, Sister.
No third party!

1105
01:19:12,063 --> 01:19:14,797
Me and you are due for a talk!

1106
01:19:14,865 --> 01:19:17,350
You have to stop
this campaign against me.

1107
01:19:17,418 --> 01:19:19,152
You can stop it at any time.

1108
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,387
How?

1109
01:19:20,471 --> 01:19:21,638
Confess and resign.

1110
01:19:21,706 --> 01:19:24,107
You are attempting
to destroy my reputation!

1111
01:19:24,175 --> 01:19:27,360
Who keeps opening my window?

1112
01:19:29,146 --> 01:19:30,797
What are you doing
in this school?

1113
01:19:30,865 --> 01:19:33,082
I'm trying to do good.

1114
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:35,368
Even more to the point,

1115
01:19:35,436 --> 01:19:38,438
what are you doing
in the priesthood?

1116
01:19:38,506 --> 01:19:42,809
You are single-handedly holding
this school and this parish back.

1117
01:19:42,876 --> 01:19:43,910
From what?

1118
01:19:43,977 --> 01:19:45,044
Progressive education

1119
01:19:45,112 --> 01:19:46,313
and a welcoming church.

1120
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,514
You can't distract me, Father.

1121
01:19:48,582 --> 01:19:50,116
This is not about my
behavior, it's about yours.

1122
01:19:50,184 --> 01:19:52,218
No, this is about
your unfounded suspicions.

1123
01:19:52,286 --> 01:19:54,137
That's right.
I have suspicions.

1124
01:19:54,205 --> 01:19:55,571
Just leave that.
It's not important.

1125
01:19:55,639 --> 01:19:57,607
I will decide

1126
01:20:00,561 --> 01:20:02,528
what's important.

1127
01:20:02,596 --> 01:20:05,448
Why do you suspect me?
What have I done?

1128
01:20:06,967 --> 01:20:10,653
You gave that boy wine, and
you let him take the blame.

1129
01:20:10,905 --> 01:20:13,940
That's completely untrue.
Did you talk to Mr. McGuinn?

1130
01:20:14,008 --> 01:20:16,326
All McGuinn knows
is that the boy drank wine.

1131
01:20:16,393 --> 01:20:18,828
He doesn't know
how he came to drink it.

1132
01:20:18,896 --> 01:20:20,831
Did his mother have
something to add to that?

1133
01:20:20,898 --> 01:20:22,065
No.

1134
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:24,150
So that's it.

1135
01:20:24,218 --> 01:20:26,753
I am not satisfied.

1136
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:29,088
Ask the boy then.

1137
01:20:29,156 --> 01:20:30,373
He'd protect you.

1138
01:20:30,441 --> 01:20:31,941
Why would he do that?

1139
01:20:31,976 --> 01:20:34,260
Because you have seduced him.

1140
01:20:34,328 --> 01:20:36,062
You're insane.

1141
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:38,531
You've got it in your head
that I corrupted this child

1142
01:20:38,599 --> 01:20:41,701
after giving him wine, and
nothing I say will change that.

1143
01:20:41,769 --> 01:20:43,036
That's right.

1144
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:44,938
But this has nothing
to do with the wine.

1145
01:20:45,005 --> 01:20:48,007
Not really. You've had a fundamental
mistrust of me before this incident.

1146
01:20:48,075 --> 01:20:51,962
It was you that warned Sister James
to be on the lookout, wasn't it?

1147
01:20:52,029 --> 01:20:53,280
That's true.

1148
01:20:53,347 --> 01:20:54,981
So you admit it!

1149
01:20:55,048 --> 01:20:56,382
Certainly.

1150
01:20:57,184 --> 01:20:58,485
Why?

1151
01:21:00,738 --> 01:21:02,305
I know people.

1152
01:21:03,741 --> 01:21:05,191
That's not good enough.

1153
01:21:05,259 --> 01:21:06,592
It won't have to be.

1154
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,111
How's that?

1155
01:21:08,179 --> 01:21:10,897
You will tell me
what you have done.

1156
01:21:12,449 --> 01:21:14,334
Oh, I will.

1157
01:21:16,203 --> 01:21:17,637
Out again.

1158
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:22,242
Sister James is convinced
I'm innocent.

1159
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:25,478
So you talked to Sister James.

1160
01:21:25,546 --> 01:21:27,863
Well, of course
you talked to Sister James.

1161
01:21:27,931 --> 01:21:29,999
Did you know Donald's
father beats him?

1162
01:21:30,067 --> 01:21:31,384
Yes.

1163
01:21:31,452 --> 01:21:34,503
And might that not account
for the odd behavior

1164
01:21:34,605 --> 01:21:37,473
Sister James noticed
in the boy?

1165
01:21:37,542 --> 01:21:39,041
It might.

1166
01:21:39,109 --> 01:21:41,828
Then what is it? What?

1167
01:21:41,895 --> 01:21:44,130
What did you hear?

1168
01:21:44,198 --> 01:21:47,566
What did you see that
convinced you so thoroughly?

1169
01:21:49,136 --> 01:21:51,755
What does it matter?

1170
01:21:51,822 --> 01:21:56,209
It matters! What does it matter?
I want to know!

1171
01:22:08,021 --> 01:22:10,457
Out this window,

1172
01:22:10,524 --> 01:22:14,978
I saw you grab
William London's wrist,

1173
01:22:15,045 --> 01:22:18,915
and I saw him pull away.

1174
01:22:34,665 --> 01:22:35,932
Are you serious?

1175
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,217
I am.

1176
01:22:38,468 --> 01:22:40,570
That's all?

1177
01:22:40,638 --> 01:22:43,472
Yeah. That was all.

1178
01:22:47,144 --> 01:22:49,011
That's nothing.

1179
01:22:50,898 --> 01:22:52,032
What are you doing now?

1180
01:22:52,099 --> 01:22:54,100
I'm writing down what you say.

1181
01:22:54,168 --> 01:22:58,804
It might be important when I have to
explain why you have to be removed.

1182
01:23:04,311 --> 01:23:07,897
This morning before I
spoke with Mrs. Miller,

1183
01:23:07,964 --> 01:23:11,317
I took the precaution of
calling your last parish.

1184
01:23:12,119 --> 01:23:13,803
What did he say?

1185
01:23:14,588 --> 01:23:16,356
Who?
The pastor.

1186
01:23:18,459 --> 01:23:22,929
I did not speak to the pastor.
I spoke to a nun.

1187
01:23:22,996 --> 01:23:25,898
You should have
spoken to the pastor.

1188
01:23:26,834 --> 01:23:28,485
I spoke to a nun.

1189
01:23:28,552 --> 01:23:30,720
You know that's not the proper route
for you to have taken, Sister.

1190
01:23:30,788 --> 01:23:33,923
The church is very clear.
You're supposed to go through the pastor.

1191
01:23:33,991 --> 01:23:36,726
Why? You have an
understanding, you and he?

1192
01:23:36,794 --> 01:23:39,829
No, you have no right to go
rummaging through my past!

1193
01:23:39,897 --> 01:23:41,765
You have a history.

1194
01:23:41,832 --> 01:23:44,567
This is your third parish
in five years.

1195
01:23:44,634 --> 01:23:46,135
Why?
Call the pastor.

1196
01:23:46,203 --> 01:23:48,905
Ask him why I left.
It's perfectly innocent.

1197
01:23:48,972 --> 01:23:50,456
I'm not calling the pastor.

1198
01:23:50,524 --> 01:23:51,975
I'm a good priest.

1199
01:23:52,042 --> 01:23:54,978
Go after another child and another
child, until you are stopped.

1200
01:23:55,045 --> 01:23:56,712
What nun did you speak to?

1201
01:23:56,797 --> 01:23:57,664
I won't say.

1202
01:23:57,732 --> 01:23:59,032
Yeah, I've not touched a child.

1203
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,101
You have!

1204
01:24:01,168 --> 01:24:03,702
You haven't the slightest
proof of anything.

1205
01:24:03,804 --> 01:24:05,338
But I have my certainty.

1206
01:24:05,406 --> 01:24:07,590
And armed with that,
I'll go to your last parish

1207
01:24:07,658 --> 01:24:10,693
and the one before that.
If necessary, I'll find a parent.

1208
01:24:10,761 --> 01:24:14,163
Trust me, Father Flynn, I will.

1209
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:17,967
You have no right
to act on your own!

1210
01:24:18,035 --> 01:24:22,255
You have taken vows,
obedience being one!

1211
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:24,207
You answer to us!

1212
01:24:24,241 --> 01:24:27,326
You have no right to
step outside the church!

1213
01:24:27,394 --> 01:24:30,980
I will step outside the church
if that's what needs to be done,

1214
01:24:31,048 --> 01:24:32,848
though the door
should shut behind me!

1215
01:24:32,916 --> 01:24:37,987
I will do what needs to be done,
though I'm damned to hell!

1216
01:24:38,055 --> 01:24:42,459
You should understand that,
or you will mistake me.

1217
01:24:45,563 --> 01:24:48,731
Now, did you give Donald
Miller wine to drink?

1218
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,568
Have you never done
anything wrong?

1219
01:24:53,453 --> 01:24:54,404
I have.

1220
01:24:54,471 --> 01:24:55,972
No mortal sin?

1221
01:25:05,048 --> 01:25:06,215
Yes.

1222
01:25:08,285 --> 01:25:09,369
And?

1223
01:25:12,089 --> 01:25:15,858
I confessed it, Father.

1224
01:25:18,529 --> 01:25:21,247
Then whatever I have done,

1225
01:25:21,314 --> 01:25:24,718
I have left in the healing
hands of my confessor.

1226
01:25:25,986 --> 01:25:27,470
As have you.

1227
01:25:29,006 --> 01:25:30,723
We are the same.

1228
01:25:35,078 --> 01:25:36,312
Mmm-mmm.

1229
01:25:38,732 --> 01:25:41,317
No, we are not.
We are not the same.

1230
01:25:51,829 --> 01:25:54,663
A dog that bites
is a dog that bites.

1231
01:25:56,917 --> 01:25:59,853
Did you give Donald
Miller wine to drink?

1232
01:26:01,021 --> 01:26:02,138
No.

1233
01:26:03,707 --> 01:26:05,808
Mental reservations?

1234
01:26:06,827 --> 01:26:07,977
No.

1235
01:26:11,098 --> 01:26:12,432
You lie.

1236
01:26:16,036 --> 01:26:17,670
Very well then.

1237
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:24,394
If you will not
leave my office, I will.

1238
01:26:27,848 --> 01:26:30,783
And once I go, I will not stop.

1239
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:38,124
Wait.

1240
01:27:04,818 --> 01:27:07,704
I can't say everything,
you understand?

1241
01:27:09,473 --> 01:27:11,741
There's things I can't say,

1242
01:27:13,727 --> 01:27:16,813
even if you can't imagine
the explanation, Sister.

1243
01:27:18,532 --> 01:27:23,052
Remember, there are things
beyond your knowledge.

1244
01:27:24,755 --> 01:27:29,775
Even if you feel certainty,
it is an emotion, not a fact.

1245
01:27:34,431 --> 01:27:36,633
You will request a transfer

1246
01:27:38,435 --> 01:27:41,788
and take a leave of absence
until it's granted.

1247
01:27:44,457 --> 01:27:47,193
You'd leave me nothing.

1248
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:49,895
It's Donald Miller
who has nothing,

1249
01:27:51,248 --> 01:27:53,082
and you took
full advantage of that.

1250
01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:57,203
I've done nothing wrong.
I care about that boy.

1251
01:27:58,105 --> 01:27:59,305
Why?

1252
01:28:02,809 --> 01:28:04,911
'Cause you smile at him?

1253
01:28:05,963 --> 01:28:09,348
And you sympathize with him?

1254
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:12,318
And you talk to him
as if you were the same?

1255
01:28:15,839 --> 01:28:18,307
You are a cheat.

1256
01:28:21,612 --> 01:28:25,164
And that warm feeling
you experienced

1257
01:28:25,232 --> 01:28:31,687
when that boy looked at you with trust
was not the sensation of virtue.

1258
01:28:31,755 --> 01:28:35,357
That could be got by any
drunkard with his tot of rum.

1259
01:28:37,427 --> 01:28:39,394
I can fight you.

1260
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,497
You will lose.

1261
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:46,769
Where's your compassion?

1262
01:28:49,173 --> 01:28:51,340
Nowhere you can get at it.

1263
01:28:54,728 --> 01:28:57,864
Stay here.
Compose yourself.

1264
01:28:59,549 --> 01:29:02,134
You can use the phone
if you'd like.

1265
01:29:03,553 --> 01:29:05,321
Good day, Father.

1266
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:18,984
I have no sympathy for you.

1267
01:29:21,354 --> 01:29:24,606
I know you are invulnerable
to true regret.

1268
01:29:31,064 --> 01:29:32,915
And cut your nails.

1280
01:31:39,710 --> 01:31:41,677
<i>I will miss it here,</i>

1281
01:31:43,063 --> 01:31:45,013
<i>and I will miss you.</i>

1282
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:50,870

1286
01:32:07,053 --> 01:32:09,822

1287

1290
01:32:29,476 --> 01:32:32,311
Goodbye, Senator.
Father.

1291
01:32:32,512 --> 01:32:34,213
Carol.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1292
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:35,965
Bless you, Father.

1293
01:32:36,033 --> 01:32:38,434
Happy holidays.
Susan. Bless you.

1294
01:32:38,501 --> 01:32:39,769
Thank you, Father.

1295
01:32:39,836 --> 01:32:41,020
Father.

1296
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,321
Thank you.

1297
01:32:42,389 --> 01:32:44,857
Be good. Thank you.

1298
01:32:44,925 --> 01:32:46,141
Thank you, Father.

1299
01:32:46,209 --> 01:32:48,911
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1300

Thank you so much.

Sister James.
Welcome back.

1306
01:34:16,999 --> 01:34:18,434
Thank you, Sister.

1307
01:34:18,501 --> 01:34:21,737
You were missed.
How is your brother?

1308
01:34:21,805 --> 01:34:23,572
Better. Much better.

1309
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:26,676
I'm very glad.
I prayed for him.

1310
01:34:28,861 --> 01:34:31,163
It was good to get away.
I needed to see my family.

1311
01:34:31,231 --> 01:34:34,683
Mmm. Then I'm glad
you did it.

1312
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:40,222
And Father Flynn is gone?

1313
01:34:41,524 --> 01:34:42,691
Yes.

1314
01:34:45,695 --> 01:34:48,129
So you did it.
You got him out.

1315
01:34:48,815 --> 01:34:49,882
Yes.

1316
01:34:52,869 --> 01:34:55,220
Donald Miller is heartbroken.

1317
01:34:55,288 --> 01:34:59,224
Can't be helped.
It's just till June.

1318
01:35:03,297 --> 01:35:07,216
I don't think Father Flynn
did anything wrong.

1319
01:35:07,283 --> 01:35:09,835
No? He convinced you?

1320
01:35:09,902 --> 01:35:11,620
Yes, he did.
Mmm.

1321
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:19,495
Did you ever prove it?

1322
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:22,715
To whom?

1323
01:35:22,783 --> 01:35:24,399
Anyone but yourself?

1324
01:35:25,702 --> 01:35:27,169
Nope.

1325
01:35:27,237 --> 01:35:28,871
But you were sure?

1326
01:35:28,938 --> 01:35:30,022
Yes.

1327
01:35:34,294 --> 01:35:36,645
I wish I could be like you.

1328
01:35:38,532 --> 01:35:39,698
Why?

1329
01:35:41,318 --> 01:35:43,619
Because I can't sleep anymore.

1330
01:35:47,356 --> 01:35:51,059
Maybe we're not supposed
to sleep so well.

1331
01:35:53,814 --> 01:35:57,016
They made Father Flynn
pastor of Saint Jerome.

1332
01:35:59,469 --> 01:36:00,903
Who?

1333
01:36:01,621 --> 01:36:03,038
The bishop.

1334
01:36:05,609 --> 01:36:10,362
Appointed Father Flynn pastor of
Saint Jerome Church and School.

1335
01:36:11,982 --> 01:36:13,632
It's a promotion.

1336
01:36:15,118 --> 01:36:16,801
You didn't tell them?

1337
01:36:16,869 --> 01:36:21,640
Oh, I told our good monsignor.
I crossed the garden, and I told him.

1338
01:36:25,145 --> 01:36:27,713
He did not believe it
to be true.

1339
01:36:31,551 --> 01:36:34,269
Then why did Father Flynn go?

1340
01:36:34,337 --> 01:36:37,506
What did you say
to make him leave?

1341
01:36:37,574 --> 01:36:40,843
That I had called a nun
in his previous parish,

1342
01:36:42,562 --> 01:36:46,915
that I had found out his prior
history of infringements.

1343
01:36:52,155 --> 01:36:53,989
So you did prove it?

1344
01:36:58,544 --> 01:37:00,346
I made no such call.

1345
01:37:04,534 --> 01:37:05,835
You lied?

1346
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,620
Yes.

1347
01:37:08,688 --> 01:37:13,458
But if he'd had no such history,
the lie wouldn't have worked.

1348
01:37:16,979 --> 01:37:19,615
His resignation
was his confession.

1349
01:37:24,604 --> 01:37:27,073
He was what I thought he was.

1350
01:37:30,009 --> 01:37:31,744
And he's gone.

1351
01:37:36,499 --> 01:37:38,600
I can't believe you lied.

1352
01:37:44,357 --> 01:37:46,709
In the pursuit of wrongdoing,

1353
01:37:47,677 --> 01:37:50,196
one steps away from God.

1354
01:37:53,884 --> 01:37:56,134
Of course, there is a price.

1355
01:38:04,644 --> 01:38:05,844
I see.

1356
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:15,854
Oh.

1357
01:38:16,439 --> 01:38:17,889
Sister James.

1358
01:38:19,326 --> 01:38:21,093
What is it, Sister?

1359
01:38:27,334 --> 01:38:29,335
I have doubts.

1360
01:38:35,925 --> 01:38:40,295
I have such doubts.
