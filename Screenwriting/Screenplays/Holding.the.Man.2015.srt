You've called Pepe Trevor.
Leave a message after the tone...
Yes? Hello?
I can't remember where he sat.
Tim, are you OK?
- Where was John?
- You know where John is.
At our dinner party with the girls - was he opposite or beside me?
Er, does it matter?
I'm trying to write it down, and I...
There were mint leaves in our drink,
I remember the colour of your dress, but I can't remem... remember where he sat, and it frightens me.
It's like
I'm going to lose it.
He was... he was...
Pepe?
Pepe?
Cambio? Cambio?
Dear John.
Lipari is paradise.
I seem to be doing many of the things
I want to do before I die.
Signor Conigrave!

- Per lei.
- Grazie.
Gloria
All set?
Let's go, boys!
He's holding the man, sir!
He's holding!
- Just get on with it!
- It's a free kick, sir!
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed
I strew.
O, woe!
Thy canopy is but dust and stones, which with sweet water nightly will I dew.
Can't you do it sadder?
You're Paris. She's Juliet.
You've lost your fiancée, not your bus pass.
Or wanting that, with tears distilled...
No, stop. Stop.
Can you imagine what it would be like to, say, lose your girlfriend.
I guess so, sir.
It'd be tremendously sad, wouldn't it?
What's her name?
I don't have a girlfriend, sir.
Yeah, wonder why!
Here, lying in her tomb, eh?
Cold. The colour- colour's gone from her face!
See?
Lifeless!
Or wanting that, with tears distilled by moans, the obsequies that I for thee shall keep nightly shall be to strew thy grave.
- And weep.

Eric, curtain!
Why is everyone saying 'break a leg'?
Because you're not meant to say 'good luck'.
You just said it.

- Is your brother in?

Two households, both alike in dignity, in fair Verona where we lay our scene.
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew.

- What's up with you?
- No, just...
Probably morning sickness.
Maybe you're pregnant.
No, Doc,

Hi.
Oh, hi.
- Sorry I missed your play.
- Oh, did you? No worries.
Hey, do you want me to...
I can...
Oh, no, I'll manage.
I'm getting good at it.
- Better get going...
- John?
Um, I'm having this thing - the girls from the play are having this dinner party thing at my place on Friday...
- Bugger!
Should you be bending?
- Pardon?
- The baby.
Oh, yeah.
So, what do you reckon, this dinner?
Getting home might be difficult.
The girl who played Juliet, her mother's giving everyone a lift home.
I don't know about theatre, or that Wobbledagger fella.
What?
Shakespeare.
I'm not putting on
Mozart!
- It's in the ice bucket.
- I know!
So, what did you think of the play?
I didn't see it.
- We were fabulous!
I should have worked harder to make you come.
- Is there a problem?
We're a new group of friends, so I think we should send a kiss around the table.
- What? No. No.
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, let's.
- Absolutely not.
I'll go first.
Gina!
Lucky last! Come here! Mwah!
For those trapped in the darkness of sin, that the light shining in

It is playing an increasingly sinister role in the everyday life of the nation.
There is scarcely any fruit that is immune in the months that the fly goes about its destructive task.

You two seem to be getting along.
I thought you had the hots for Derge, Tim.
He is the father of your child.
I'm sorry, but my heart belongs to John.
Might have to make it a three-way.
You have to drop him,
Conigrave.
Derge needs to know he's special.
Alright! John, you're dropped.
- You guys are off!
Hello?
Are you there?
Hello?
Yes, hello, um,
I'm calling for John.
Who's speaking?
Timothy Conigrave.
One moment, Timothy.
This is a nice surprise.
Is it? That's... good.
There's something
I want to tell you.
I'm all ears.
That game
Biscuit played in class...
What game?
Where he said I have to drop you - I didn't like it.
I didn't like saying that to you.
That I have to drop you.
Just a game.
Mum's got dinner on. I'm supposed to set the table...
- You have to go?
- Yeah. Sorry.
- That's OK. Bye.

Because it's fun!
Can you see if you can stop?
Mmm.
Have you seen my Cleo magazine?
No.
Dear John.
It's 1am and I can't sleep.
I think I went too far too soon when I reached into your daks.
All I can say is I'm sorry.
I don't want to pressure you to have sex.
I love you, and if all we ever do is hug, that is enough for me.

Idiot!
We are now going to further investigate...
..the topological formation of our own continent.
There are, as you know,
14 major tectonic plates.
If you don't know them already, write them down, because you need to know them.
They are of course, first, the Eurasian plate, two, Australian-Indian, three, Philippines, four, Pacific, five, Juan de Fuca...
I expected more of you, Caleo.
Six, Nazca, seven, Cocos.
We love each other. What are you going to do about it?
Tim!
You're mumbling, Tim.
We love each other and what are you going to do about it?
Father, please!
This can't get around.
I'm afraid it's too late for that.
There are people in this place that want to discipline you.
You're quite the topic of conversation in the staffroom.
Why haven't they tried to stop us?
The lay staff would like to...
..but the Jesuits look out for you.
We've seen this before.
- Be careful, Tim.
Yes, Father.
Not everything has to be political.
Doesn't it?
Tim, there will be other battles, and they will need educated people to fight them.
Don't jeopardise your schooling over this, boys.
Bless us, O Lord, and these, thy gifts we are about to receive from thy bounty.
Through Christ, our Lord, amen.
Amen.
Tim?
Thank you, Mrs Caleo.
Lovely manners.
What about you?
Do you want an onion?
There you go.
What about you?
No, I'm right at the moment.
- It's really good, Mum.
- That's really nice, Mum.
Is it, darling?
John, er... John's changed.
We've all noticed.
Ever since he's been hanging around with you.
He's come out of himself.
Lois and I are very grateful.
We'd like to thank you.
He's a great guy.
Mum's rule - friends sleep in here on a school night, otherwise I stay up yakking.
I don't mind.
You reckon your parents will let you come away to Eric's for the study break?
They said as long as you're going.
Five fellas in a shack. You never know what might happen.
- Shh!
- Shh, shh.
- Oh!
- Shh, shh.
I feel like
I played a grand final.
We'll be back with lunch.
Good luck!
What are you doing?
Just felt like it.
Dear John.
I think I went too far too soon when I reached into your daks.
Dad? Did Paul get an extra two bucks?
I'm the one who cleaned the gutters.
Out!
What the fu...
Are you fucking kidding?!
Thanks.
Ought to run into town for more beer.
Too frigging cold.
Good streaking weather.
Piss off, I'm not doing that.
What? You have before.
Leave it, Biscuit.
No, why not?
Fuck off, Conigrave.
Just fuck off.
Fucking homo.
Yes!
Oh, Dergey boy!
- Lovely night for it!
Run like the clappers, boys.
I'm doing it, but don't you two look at my arse!
Come on, Derge!
Hello.
Has someone died?
I told myself
I was being stupid.
What?
John's father came to see me today.
He made me read your letter.
What letter?
Tim, when I was your age guys used to muck around in the showers at the yacht club while their parents were up in the bar.
Everyone did it.
You're gonna grow out of this.
I hope you do, otherwise you're going to have a very lonely life.
A very sad life.
Up until now,
I couldn't be happier.
Don't be smart!
You're living under our roof.
Your mother and I have made a decision.
You and John can't see each other anymore.
Yes, we can.
You can't stop us.
The man is threatening court action.
And do you support him?
What you're doing is illegal.
Do you support him?
No, frankly, we don't, but today has been the most humiliating day of my life!
John won't be staying here anymore, and you're not to use the telephone to contact him.
You fucking poxy traitors!
I hope you get cancer!
Wow.
They all call you the school poofter!
I stuck up for you, and then I find out it's true!

John?
Homework all done?
Pretty much.
Your mother's very upset.
I talked to the parish priest.
He recommended a psychologist.
Your mother will make an appointment and then you will see this man.
John, you've got to put this in the past.
Exams soon, so it ought to be easy for you to avoid Tim.

Ah.
Year of the Pig.
Little sandalwood always helps.
So, it's OK...
I'm taping this?
Sit. You're making me nervous.
So, we're devising a theatre piece - the actors, and me as the writer.
We've all graduated drama school. You know NIDA?
I know Narnia.
No, not that.
Erm, we agreed to interview people because we felt the issue has been hijacked by the media - all this sex, death, horror shit.
How long have you been positive?
Me?No, I'm not.
And rather not know.
Well, if you haven't been exposed...
How can you write this play?
You're making assumptions about your status.
No, I'm in a stable relationship.
I think he's cheating on you.
You don't know him.
We've been together since high school.
What - constantly?
That doesn't happen.
Just... going to check...
..see if that's working.
OK.
So, perhaps just state your name and age.
Me?
I'm Richard.
I'm 33, and I have decided
I am going to make it to 34.
What do you want to include in your play?
I've forgotten - were we talking about a helicopter?
- No.
I mean, the kind of helicopter that drops supplies.
No.
I get ticked off that some people get this nice little boat ride, you know?
Instead I'm in the quicksand with the snakes!
I shouldn't have to put up with it.
OK.
I mean, don't get me wrong, because most people have only seen these things in a book or something like that.
Like a leopard.
The other night on the stairs,
I saw one for real.
Where were you?
In the Congo.
Leopard was gonna have a baby.
You think
I'm not making sense...
..but I am.
Can I help you?
You weren't worried, were you?
Nah. Can you imagine being told you've got it?
Well, we don't.
You want to go grab some lunch after this?
Some of us have real jobs.
Tim, 2117?
Look at us.
We're fast-lane gays.
Tim?
What is it?
Um... he said I'm positive,
John.
But I'm negative.
I should... I'll explain.
The system here is that if your result is negative, you see a counsellor, and if you're positive, you see a doctor, like me.
John, the clerk put your file in the wrong pigeonhole, and the counsellor gave you the result without checking the file.
I'm sorry.
You've been given the wrong result.
You're positive. You both are.
I'd like to take some blood from you both to do a cell count.
I'm terribly...
I'm... truly so sorry.
This should not happen. I...
Can you not stretch my
T-shirt?
I'm not!
Do you think I infected you?
You, with your high T8 counts.
You're recently infected, that's what the doctor was saying.
We didn't know this was lurking.
It didn't have a name.
It's not as though...
I mean,
I've hardly been with...
I got something.
I couldn't decide between
'ribbed for her pleasure' or...
We're not gonna fuck, Tim.
That's how we got into this mess in the first place.
Most people have only seen these things in a book or something like that.
The other night on the stairs,
I saw one for real.
In the Congo.
The leopard was going to have a baby.
Richard had been diagnosed with toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by a parasite found in cat faeces.
Are you telling me
I ate cat poo?
Probably as a kid playing in a sandpit.
We all did, darling.
We mistook it for a consequence-free environment.
We had hoped to interview
Richard again, but as he prepared to welcome in 1986,
Richard succumbed to dementia and a litany of AIDS-related illnesses.
Just down the road from here, at St Vincent's.
If there were thousands of school kids dropping dead, they'd do something about it.
God help you if you're a poofter, or a junkie, or a prostitute!
We're not like those people in the play.
It's not gonna get us.
We're lucky.
We're the second wave.
They're gonna cure it.
- Are you ready?
- Not really.
Let's do it.

- You are Catholic.

It's not an insult, Tim.
Did this conversation just stop being sexy?
Please?

- Are you serious?

Are you trying to teach us self-loathing, is that it?
No. This is about gesture, tone of voice, courage.
Look at you. That's a very womanly way to hold yourself.
A third of this class is gay, did you know that?
You're more than your sexuality, Tim.
Walk. Long neck.
Come on.
Oh!
Oh, you want some rough-house?
I'll give you some rough-house!
- Line!
- No.
- Line!
- No!
Can we stop playing games, please, Barry?
How about you listen to the other person on stage for once?
- I have a right...
- You think you're an actor?
I think you want to be the loudest person in the room.
- I'm just...
- I'm speaking.
I think you're here to be validated, to be loved.
Find that elsewhere.
We're not giving you that, and your audience certainly won't.
Now, play the blasted scene!
I can't.
Well, I think that's answered that.
Brett, you'll do Stanley.

- Chookas, darling.
The house is open.
Is he here?
Chookas! Have a good show!
No.
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba!
More than any desire anywhere...
..deep down, in my deepest heart,
..I want you back again.
Please... John...
Don't say any more.
You're making me cry so dreadfully.
Tim, get off!
I have to go.
Take me with you! I can't bear that mean drama school!
They say I'm too gay, too loud...
- They might be right.
- ..I'm too self-centred.
And I want my Tupperware back.
Sure, if I visit again.
Might you visit again?
Maybe I'll check out some chiro clinics up here.
Really? Ow! Ow!
Hang on, this is knackering me.
I spoke to Dad about a business loan.
It would have to be
Melbourne but.
Sydney needs chiropractors too.
Thanks for coming all this way.
I wasn't sure you would.
Good to give the new wheels a run.
Hmm.
Mum and Dad don't want me to move up here.
All this stuff on TV.
What - gay means AIDS?
For them, I guess it does.
Pathetic!
I knew you'd react like that.
Well, I'll be waiting for you,
John.
If you choose Sydney.
- John.
- What?
Can I kiss you?

You got everything?
Can I have my sign?
- It's mine.
- Dickhead.
Give it to Lois for the trophy cabinet.
Yep.
You're doing the right thing.
They were gonna guess anyway, with me selling up the business.
I'm proud of you.
Maybe I 'll be brave enough to tell mine.
Not the week of your sister's wedding.
John. I know that.
Hi, Tim. Hello.
You gonna give me a kiss goodbye?
We've got Aunt Mary staying in your room, but you should be comfortable out here.
Oh, you got those? Good.
You gotta update your address, mate.
They're ancient.
Did you hear we're having a band at the reception?
Very good, they are.
We'll be in the ballroom over at Ripponlea.
Did you open this one?
Maybe Mum. She's the one who kept them for you.
No, it'll be a big show, don't you worry.
We've got an orchestra at the church.
That's a bit over the top, isn't it?
It's a small chamber orchestra.
So, it's a full nuptial, communion and all?
- Is she Catholic still?
- It's what your sister wants.
Best wedding I ever went to was my friend Morna's.
It was a simple exchanging of vows in a room full of friends.
It was very moving.
Why don't you pull your head in, Tim?
It's part of our Look Back scheme.
You donated blood in 1981.
It was pooled with 19 others'.
Mr Conigrave, the patient who received it has gone on to develop AIDS.
We'd like you to be tested.
It's fine. There's no need.
I am positive, but I was infected in 1985.
You mean you were diagnosed in 1985?
Yes.
Really, there's no reason to...
1981?
Mr Conigrave, you're one of the last to be contacted.
The other donors are all clear.
Not this week, Tim.
You read it?
Wash your hands.
I need some help.
I'm flat-out with relatives arriving from everywhere and your father wants his pre-wedding drinks.
AI fresco is just not me.
Now, can you see how to slice and twist the salmon, just like the picture?
I've been doing some volunteering.
Well, I get paid for it now.
It's social work... for the AIDS Council.
Tell me I've nothing to worry about.
What a waste.
All that talent.
I'm not dead yet.
I just don't understand how you've got it!
I mean, it's just you and John.
- We've both got it.
- Oh, God.
That beautiful boy.
Is it from a donation? Is that why the Red Cross are writing?
Would you prefer it that way?
Did I say that?
I didn't say that.
I prefer none of it, thank you!
After the wedding, after all of this,
I think we should tell Dad.
I'm making a mess!
Look at this!
This letter, it's changed things.
It says I could have been infected... since university.
John and I, we always assumed he was first.
I think I was comfortable with that.
Now it's...
Mum, it's like I've killed the man that I love!
Now, what's all this slacking off in the kitchen?
How did it go?
Mum just kept blowing her nose.
Dad wanted to talk about my business insurance.
They wanted to fall apart alone.
- Drink, gentlemen?
- I can't.
I suppose your parents assume I infected you.
No. Why would you even say that?
I told my parents.
Now?
- Why?!
- Because I...
How could you be so selfish?!
You are gorgeous.
Timothy's Aunty Gae told me about the eyelashes.
- They're false.
We loved your dog food commercial, Timothy.
Thanks.
I'm doing social work now.
- And writing another play.
- He's my PR man.
Hey, do you reckon you could introduce me to Mel Gibson?
I work for the AIDS Council.
I'm on the hotline and the van that goes up and down the Wall.
That's where male sex workers find their clients, and we empower them to have safe sex and have someone to talk to.
I find it really rewarding.
That's nice for you, dear.
John, I'm stealing you.
Come on, son.
Let's show 'em how it's done.
No.
- Come on.
- No.
- Who's leading?
- I am.
♪ I hate to say it
♪ But you have a right to be free
♪ I know it's the way it should be
♪ But I'm too far... ♪
Hey! This old bloke's been asking about you all night.
Here you are, Timothy.
♪ I love you so much for so long... ♪
Oh, come on, Aunty Gae.
Hey, Tim. Nice one, brother.
You alright?
I'm here, John.
My lung has popped...
Try not to talk, John.
We don't want a coughing fit.
Was it the chemo?
More likely a burst PCP cyst.
You're his boyfriend?
You're staying?
Now, how's that local?
OK.
I'm about to cut now, John.
Right, this is going to hurt a bit, John.
That's it, bubbling away.
When the bubbles stop, we know it's healed.
Tim!
Nearly there.
Good, good.
Just a little bit more.
And done.
He'll be in for a few days, at least.
- You have some rest.
- I'm fine.
It's seeing him in pain
I can't bear.
He'll need his boyfriend healthy.
If the lung doesn't stick, it's going to need to be surgery, but only when he's strong enough.
He'll need you.
Our freezer is chockers.
Penny Cook has made you minestrone.
Morna has made you minestrone.
Someone has made you...
I'm not sure what that is.
Why'd you bring those?
Penny's comes with a little pesto in a separate container, so...
..let's go with that.
I'm sorry.
Snotty tissue got eaten by the Simpson fully automatic.
Didn't you check?
Can't you do anything right?
I'm sorry.
I think I forgot the pesto.
Will I still be able to write?
Shall we look at your scan?
I've been looking at it.
Toxoplasmosis, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.
- I did a theatre thing once.
Transmits via cats.
I wrote this thing.
I knew I'd get it eventually.
I'm thinking of getting people together, starting something.
I'm feeling very creative and
I don't want to waste that, if I'm gonna have brain damage.
- Lesions don't eat the brain.
- Which is a terrific phrase!
But they do put pressure on it.
You're feeling up - creative, you say?
What about dementia, memory loss? Sorry, go on.
We'll learn more as we treat it.
I'm convinced it will happen.
I'm thinking about getting people together.
You said that.
I'm having ideas and I could start something.
- Tim? I think you're manic.
- Do you?
Yes - the cells in your brain have become sensitive to certain neurotransmitters.
- I'm prescribing Haloperidol.
- No, I'm good. We're good.
John's in here and he's being looked after.
I think we'll have to admit you.
I don't want you spending all your money or thinking that you're Jesus.
What happens to my soul if I go mad?
Does it stay trapped inside or is it floating free?
I don't want to be here!
I don't want to be here!
- Get me out of...
I don't want to be here!
Take me home!
You alright there, darling?
OK.
OK, one from the side.
Are you making fun of me?
I'm doing it because you look so beautiful.
- Hello, son.
- Hmm?
Hi.
We're just... in a good mood.
Had some good news.
Would you like a chair, Bob?
From the flat.
Bills and stuff, eh?
Thank you.
So, what are the doctors saying, John?
He's not allowed to talk.
Er, the lung again.
- But we've had...
- Good news, Dad.
He's not supposed to talk.
He's had some good news.
John's in remission.
When he's strong enough, he'll go into surgery, and they'll open him up, and see the snips and snails and puppy dog tails and sew up the lung.
Can you believe it? Remission!
You've worked hard for it, son.
They're saying we can probably go home in the meantime.
What have you done to his hair?
It was getting ratty.
- Beg your pardon?
- 'Put your hearing aid in.'
- I don't like wearing it.
John's talking about going home for Christmas.
They can't operate until January.
Your mum'll like that.
We'll fly you back down, John.
He's had a pneumothorax.
The airlines won't let him fly, but I'll drive him down.
I found it in the drawer of the desk.
I have some concerns.
Why is Tim getting everything?
I want to make sure he's alright if I die.
I'm sorry,
I didn't get any of that.
He said he wants to make sure
I'm alright if he dies.
Tim, your will is, um, made out similarly.
It is.
So, if John dies first, you inherit his belongings, then say you die a month later, everything goes to your family?
I don't think that's fair.
I put John through school and college, and I think I deserve half.
Who owns the television and the video?
And the bed?
Some things we bought together. Can I have a look?
Just trying to remember who bought the Vegemite last.
- It was probably you, John.
- Yes, you go through it.
- Hurts my lungs to laugh.
- Oh, sorry.
And the boy videos - your family would enjoy
Frisky Pool Party 7.
That's right!
Tim, the car isn't yours.
No, but I need it.
John told Lois that you had to have a scan.
Did he, now?
- For your eyes.
- My eyes are fine, Bob.
- Something in your brain.
- No, that's not right.
I'm on medication.
I am allowed to drive.
I'm sorry, John.
I helped pay for that car.
I would like it to come back to Melbourne, please.
Might find something to eat.
And some little red dots to mark up the apartment.
Some things are only fair.
You're telling people
I have cancer?
It's AIDS, Dad.
The cancer is from AIDS.
That's something you have to take up with your mother.
I'm taking it up with you.
I'm not ashamed of what I have.

How's he doing?
This is Peter.
He helped resuscitate John.
- Hey, Tim.
- Peter!
- Hey.
- You know each other?
From the gay group at uni.
We've had a few of the Gaysoc boys through.
Who from Gaysoc?
They here now?
- Tim, have you eaten?
- I'm good.
Mrs Caleo?
We're not supposed to, but
I could speak to the kitchen.
Oh, I'm fine, thanks.
Tim? I thought Lois had...
I offered.
Just gotta grab something for John from under the tree.
Right. Come in, come in.
I'll help you.
I wrapped most of them.
I'm just after the one from John to me.
The funeral will be held at a church here in Melbourne, and we don't want people making statements.
You mean about AIDS?
And the whole... gay thing.
Everybody knows anyway.
No need.
You know that's against
John's wishes?
Be it on your conscience.
Such a tragedy.
How did this happen?
It's a Stable Table!
So you can eat in front of the teev.
Better than the pyjamas
Mum got me.
Suppose you're not gonna keep the wrapping.
Darling!
What on earth is it?
It's a document holder, for writing.
It's got a little motorised clamp that moves up and down when you use the foot pedal.
It's... bizarre.
You don't like it?
It's good. I just don't know that the clamp is that useful.
You always have to tell the truth, don't you, Timothy?
It's for when you write.
I'll use it. I promise.
The first present you ever gave me was wrapped in Essendon colours.
Sounds right.
Bryan Ferry's
Let's Stick Together.
How do you remember that?
I remember everything.
You said you saw him on Countdown and he made you feel a bit sweaty.
- Did I?
- What a poof.
Tim...
..when they revived me, before I came around...
..I was just not here for a bit, and it was so easy, Timba.
Are you OK hearing that?
No!
I'm not ready for you to go.
We've said our goodbyes.
Haven't we?
You can't go without me at your side.
That's the deal.
Oh, shut up, John.
We're trying to sleep
He was my favourite.
I'm not supposed to say it - all my boys are wonderful, but...
..he was my favourite.
Never a problem.
Lois, do you mind if I have a moment with John?
I ought to stretch my legs, any rate.
In the schoolyard,
I noticed a boy.
Just... listening to his friends with his hands in his pockets.
Smiling.
What is it about his face?
In class, lined up my books and tartan pencil case...
..and watched the door.
Then he walked in.
The boy with the amazing eyelashes.
John Caleo was in my class.
I want you to know
I'll do my best to include you when it's time for the funeral.
I'll talk about you as his... friend.
Are you happy with that?
We... we have been together for 15 years.
He is my husband.
There'll be nothing gained by further alienating the parents.
Why?
So they can reclaim him from the dirty poofter who corrupted him?
Tim?
Excuse me.

I am writing this from the garden at the back of my hotel.
Surrounded by orange trees and bougainvillea.
I visited the island of Salina yesterday, the island where your grandparents were born.
It was a bit like a private pilgrimage.
The cafe is only open for an hour.
You can understand why they emigrated.
Pronto?
Is a Timothy Conigrave staying at your hotel?
Tim Conigrave, il ragazzo australiano?
- Could I leave a message?
- Si. Momento.
Here on Lipari is where I most miss you.
I think you would have loved this place.
It's warm and very strong.
Signor Conigrave!
Signor Conigrave!
Signor Conigrave!
Signor Conigrave!
- Per lei.

There is a beautiful boy who works at the hotel here.
He occupies my dreams.
But that is just misdirected need for you.
- 'Lassu'.
- 'Lassu'?
Ah! Angelo.
- Angelo!
- Si, Si! Si!
You are a hole in my life - a black hole.
Anything I place there cannot be returned.
I miss you terribly.
Ci vedremo lassu, Angelo.
