00:02:40,014 --> 00:02:42,721
- All right. Off you go.
- (Girl) Happy Christmas, teacher!

7
00:02:42,722 --> 00:02:44,221
- Happy New Year.
- Thank you, Dave.

8
00:02:44,222 --> 00:02:45,846
Give my love
to your girlfriend in Sydney, sir.

9
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:47,763
I'll do that, sir, thank you.

10
00:02:47,764 --> 00:02:49,221
Have a happy holiday, sir.

11
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:51,805
And you, Chris, thank you.
Enjoy yourself.

12
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:54,055
- For your collection, sir.
- Thank you very much, Lou.

13
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:57,263
Bye-bye.

14
00:02:57,264 --> 00:02:59,763
S0 I'll see you next year, mate.

15
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:04,764
(Sighs)

16
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:22,681
(Charlie) Shut up!

17
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:28,388
(Flies buzzing)

18
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,389
A middy, please, Charlie.

19
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:53,971
Having one yourself?

20
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:58,972
Yeah.

21
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,221
You've, uh...

22
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:19,096
got snakes in your pocket,
have you?

23
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:22,138

25
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:29,430
Mmm...

26
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:34,431
Keys.

27
00:07:41,556 --> 00:07:45,680
Will you be wanting your room
when you come back?

28
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,971
Where else would I stay?

29
00:07:47,972 --> 00:07:52,972
(Chuckles)

30
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:03,680
But if you get a flood of tourists
0r anything, Charlie,

31
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,596
I can always stay
in the schoolhouse.

(Train horn sounding)

35

See you in six weeks, huh?

36
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:30,721
Not if I can rob a bank.

37
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:34,221
- Sure, Ned Kelly.
- Mmm.

38
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:38,013
(Train horn sounding)

39
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:43,014
- (Charlie) See you, then.
- Uh-huh.

00:08:43,347 --> 00:08:45,138

Excuse me, please.

45
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:25,221
- Oi, fella, come and have a beer with us.
- N0. N0, thanks.

46
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:30,222
Come on,
come and have a beer.

47
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:38,639

(I Quietly singing along)

52
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:18,346
New to the Yabba?

53
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:19,721
Yes.

54
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,513
Staying W18?

55
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,971
N0, just tonight.

56
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:24,638
Oh, that's hard luck.

57
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,138
Want to see a bit more
of the Yabba than that.

58
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,680
You think it's worth seeing?

59
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,846
(Chuckles)
It's the best place in Australia.

60
00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:35,305
- Everybody likes the Yabba.
- (John) Why?

61
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:38,513
(Driver)
Well, it's a friendly place.

62
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:41,721
Nobody worries who you are
0r where you come from.

63
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:43,555
You're a good bloke,
you're all right.

64
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:48,556
You know what I mean?

65
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:58,388
(Exhales)

66
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:59,971
Excuse me.

67
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:04,972
D0 you have a room for John Grant?
I made a booking by letter.

68
00:12:06,472 --> 00:12:09,638
Oh, I'm only staying the night.
I'm flying to Sydney in the morning.

69
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,805
You have to pay now.

70
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:13,680
I think we can manage that.

71
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:18,681
It'll be $4.

72
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:30,305
There's $1 deposit on the keys.

73
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:33,305
You'll get that back
when you bring the keys back.

74
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:38,306
Thank you.

75
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:44,805
Could you tell me
where room seven is, please?

76
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:49,806
Up the steps and down the corridor
to the right.

77
00:12:59,764 --> 00:13:04,764
(People clamouring)

78
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:11,764
Hey. Shut it, mate.
We're closed.

79
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:56,347
Excuse me.

80
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:06,347
(I Men singing drunkenly)

81
00:14:25,722 --> 00:14:27,971
You're new to the Yabba?

82
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:30,763
Well, I just dropped in for the night.
I'm flying to Sydney in the morning.

83
00:14:30,764 --> 00:14:31,888
Uh-huh.

84
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:34,346
- Come far?
- Tiboonda.

85
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:36,305
Ah, nice little place.

86
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:37,596
D0 you like it?

87
00:14:37,597 --> 00:14:39,721
Paradise on Earth.

88
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:41,180
Yeah.

89
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,638
What do you do out there?

90
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,639
Oh, I'm a bonded slave
of the Education Department.

91
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:49,305
I'm a school teacher.

92
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,680
Oh, yes.

93
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,888
You took over from old Murchison,
didn't you?

94
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:54,513
McDonald, his name is.

95
00:14:54,514 --> 00:14:59,221
Of course.
And you're, uh...

96
00:14:59,222 --> 00:15:01,888
- Grant.
- Yeah, that's right.

97
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:04,055
Well, I'll be blown.

98
00:15:04,056 --> 00:15:07,138
Crawford's the name.
Jock Crawford.

99
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,346
- John Grant.
- I'm pleased to know you, Jack.

100
00:15:10,347 --> 00:15:15,347
What about another beer?

101
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:23,431
Thanks, Mr Crawford.

102
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:42,471
- Here you are, Jack.
- Thanks.

103
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:46,971
You, uh...
You say you're a slave.

104
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:48,721
What do you mean by that?

105
00:15:48,722 --> 00:15:50,888
You wouldn't know
how our educational authorities

106
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,763
get teachers for the outback?

107
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:55,138
Wouldn't have a clue, mate.

108
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:59,138
Now, a new teacher
has to post a bond for $1,000.

109
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:01,305
That 1,000 guarantees
you'll serve out your contract

110
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:03,763
wherever they send you.

111
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:08,013
Oh, well. I suppose
they know what they're doing.

112
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:12,596
You clever blokes never like to stop
in the one spot long, do you?

113
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,930
- Depends on the place.
- (Laughs) Yeah, that's right.

114
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:18,596
Well, never mind, Jack.

115
00:16:18,597 --> 00:16:21,388
You can always come to the Yabba
for your holidays.

116
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:23,013
Good luck.

117
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:28,014
Yes, that's something
to look forward to.

118
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:42,764
N0, thanks,
I'll be running along.

119
00:16:57,722 --> 00:17:00,096
Police have much to do
in Bundanyabba?

120
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:02,888
N0. N0, not really.

121
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,555
We sort of...

122
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,346
We just sort of
keep an eye on things.

123
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:10,846
Honestest little town in Australia,
this is, mate.

124
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:12,263
But, mind you,

125
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:15,763
there are not too many game enough
to try anything around here.

126
00:17:15,764 --> 00:17:19,888
You see, we're so isolated,
there's nowhere to go.

127
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:22,346
We get 'em, and quick.

128
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:24,555
Sounds like an easy life.

129
00:17:24,556 --> 00:17:27,555
Yeah, not bad.

130
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:30,221
Of course,
we do have a few suicides.

131
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:31,471
Yeah?

132
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:34,721
Yeah. Yeah,
they reckon it's the heat.

133
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:38,305
Me... (Laughs)
I like the heat.

134
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:41,680
Yeah, it's one way
of getting out of town.

135
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:43,596
What is?

136
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:48,597
Killing yourself.

137
00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:52,971
Hey, that's good.
I like a bloke with a sense of humour.

138
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:57,972
(Laughs)
Oh... Killing yourself.

139
00:18:08,764 --> 00:18:11,513
Two more, Kate.

140
00:18:11,514 --> 00:18:16,514
(I Band playing
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer")

141
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:18,638
Have you ever been
anywhere else?

142
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:23,639
Yeah. Did three months'
training in the city.

143
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:31,556
Didn't like it.

144
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:33,096
A couple more?

145
00:18:33,097 --> 00:18:37,596
Here, give us your dough.
I'll get 'em quicker than you.

146
00:18:37,597 --> 00:18:40,763
IThen one foggy Christmas Eve

147
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:44,180
ISanta came to say

148
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:47,680

(People cheering)

152
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,263
Here you are.

153
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:03,596
I slung your change to the steward.

154
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:05,305
Told him it was yours.

155
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:10,306
D0 you a bit of good
when you come back again.

156
00:19:11,972 --> 00:19:14,680
(Chattering stops)

157
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:19,430
Get up, get UP-

00:19:50,097 --> 00:19:51,638
'Lest we forget.'

166
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:53,388
(All) Lest we forget.

167
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:55,971
'Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.'

168
00:19:55,972 --> 00:20:00,972
(Chattering resumes)

169
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:10,763
N0, as long as they close
before the show, they're shut...

170
00:20:10,764 --> 00:20:12,096
(Laughing)

171
00:20:12,097 --> 00:20:13,846
Come on,
the beer's real good here.

172
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:17,680
Oh, no, Jock.
N0, I'll pass out if I don't eat soon.

173
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:20,013
Well, it's easy to see
you're not a Yabba man.

174
00:20:20,014 --> 00:20:21,805
A Yabba man!

175
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:26,555
A Yabba man...
You're the Yabba man, Jock.

176
00:20:26,556 --> 00:20:28,430
The Bundanyabba man.

177
00:20:28,431 --> 00:20:30,805
(Laughing)

178
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:32,971
All right, all right.

179
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:36,721
Come on, I'll show you
where you can get a real good steak.

180
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:40,596
(Jock) This is a mate of mine, John Grant.
You can let him in anytime.

181
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:42,846
He's all right.

182
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:45,346
(Man) How's it going there, Jock?
(Jock) Oh, not too bad, Jim.

183
00:20:45,347 --> 00:20:50,347
- How's it with you?
- Great.

184
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:58,096
Hey, Joe.
Put a steak on for me mate, will you?

185
00:20:58,097 --> 00:21:03,097
Yeah, lovely.
Hey, Tim. One steak, mate.

186
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,888
- Oh, rare, please.
- Yeah, all right.

187
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:09,096
How's the missus?

188
00:21:09,097 --> 00:21:11,388
Oh, she was a bit crook last week.
She all right now, Jock.

189
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:13,013
- And the kid?
- Oh, this kid's gold.

190
00:21:13,014 --> 00:21:15,138
You tell him to stop missing school
or I'll have you.

191
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:17,138
All right, mate.

192
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:19,305
Come on, I'll show you inside
while we're waiting.

193
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:20,471
All right.

194
00:21:20,472 --> 00:21:23,013
Biggest two-up game
in Australia, Jack.

195
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:28,014
(People chattering)

196
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:32,263
Right on, fellas.
I want 100 in the middle.

197
00:21:32,264 --> 00:21:35,263
- The spinner's the bloke with the kip.
- Kip?

198
00:21:35,264 --> 00:21:37,221
Yeah, the bit of wood
they put the pennies on.

199
00:21:37,222 --> 00:21:38,971
He's just dropped
$100 in the centre.

200
00:21:38,972 --> 00:21:41,721
That's got to be covered
before they can spin 'em.

201
00:21:41,722 --> 00:21:45,763
Now it's been covered,
they can all get in for a side bet.

202
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:50,764
(All clamouring)

203
00:21:53,056 --> 00:21:58,056
- Heads, heads, heads...
- Tails. Tails.

204
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:02,388
- Who wants to go on the heads?
- (Man) Put 50 on heads.

205
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:05,221
You know, the little fella with the kip's
a fella named Charlie Jones.

206
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:10,222
Comes in here every Friday night
with his pay packet.

207
00:22:11,056 --> 00:22:12,930
Bets are closing.

208
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:16,221
Clear a space.

209
00:22:16,222 --> 00:22:18,305
Quiet! Hey!

210
00:22:18,306 --> 00:22:20,138
(Shushes)

211
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:23,305
Settle down, settle down.
What do you think it is?

212
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:28,306
(Man) Fair go, chaps.

213
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:37,139
- Heads!
- (All clamouring)

214
00:22:38,764 --> 00:22:41,305
D0 you get the idea now, Jack?

215
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:44,055
Well, you just bet on whether
the pennies come down heads 0r tails.

216
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:45,638
Yeah, that's right.

217
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:49,805
(Scoffs) You think this crowd will be
at each 0ther's throats when they settle?

218
00:22:49,806 --> 00:22:51,805
Ah, there's hardly a fight.

219
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:54,971
Each man knows what's coming to him,
he just goes and gets it.

220
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:57,180
Heads, heads, heads...

221
00:22:57,181 --> 00:22:58,680
Tails, tails, tails...

222
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:01,971
- (indistinct)
- Sixty on tails...

223
00:23:01,972 --> 00:23:04,971
(Whispering)

224
00:23:04,972 --> 00:23:09,972
(Shushes) Fair go.

225
00:23:12,722 --> 00:23:14,763
Watch your feet now.

226
00:23:14,764 --> 00:23:16,305
Watch yourself there.

227
00:23:16,306 --> 00:23:18,638
Wait for it.
Wait for it now.

228
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:20,263
(Man) Heads!

229
00:23:20,264 --> 00:23:25,264
(All clamouring)

230
00:23:31,347 --> 00:23:33,096
Four hundred, Charlie,
what do you wanna do?

231
00:23:33,097 --> 00:23:34,221
Put the lot on.

232
00:23:34,222 --> 00:23:38,721
Yeah, Charlie always goes
for 8000r bust.

233
00:23:38,722 --> 00:23:41,096
You gotta throw
four heads in a row to do it, too.

234
00:23:41,097 --> 00:23:42,680
(Man) Come on now, hurry up.
Get 'em on.

235
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:45,471
And what does he do
with the winnings?

236
00:23:45,472 --> 00:23:49,305
Well, nothing.

237
00:23:49,306 --> 00:23:52,180
(Controller) Simmer down, boys.
Settle down.

238
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,971
(Man) Put 'em on, Charlie, now, come on.
(Controller) When you're ready, Charles.

239
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:57,846
(Man) When you're ready.
(Controller) Fair go.

240
00:23:57,847 --> 00:24:02,596
Fair go.

241
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:07,597
(Controller) Heads.

242
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:14,347
(Man) Beauty, Charlie.

243
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:21,096
You're casting
a spell around here.

244
00:24:21,097 --> 00:24:24,638
There's a nice
simple-minded game.

245
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:28,138
- My steak's probably ready.
- (Jock) Yeah, come on.

246
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:33,139
Here you are.
That'll be a dollar, son.

247
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,013
There's a clean place here, Jack.

248
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:41,430
Oh.

249
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:43,263
Well, I'll have to be pushing along.

250
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,513
Oh, thanks, Jock.
Thanks for showing me around.

251
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:47,930
Oh, that's all right.

252
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:52,931
And that'll be the best dollar's worth
you'll ever have in your life, matey.

253
00:24:55,472 --> 00:24:59,305
All the little devils are proud of hell.

254
00:24:59,306 --> 00:25:04,306
- (Man) Two heads.
- (Crowd cheering)

255
00:25:07,722 --> 00:25:12,722
D0 you mean you don't think the Yabba
is the greatest little place on Earth?

256
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:17,430
- It could be worse.
- How?

257
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:22,431
The supply of beer could run out.

258
00:25:30,931 --> 00:25:33,346
Hey, aren't you going to eat that?

259
00:25:33,347 --> 00:25:38,347
N0.

260
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:52,346
- Why did you say that?
- Say what?

261
00:25:52,347 --> 00:25:56,180
Well, about them being proud of hell.

262
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:59,638
Discontent is a luxury
of the well-to-do.

263
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:04,639
If you gotta live here,
you might as well like it.

264
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,305
Why don't you like Crawford?

265
00:26:08,306 --> 00:26:10,721
Jock?

266
00:26:10,722 --> 00:26:14,555
The touch of his hairy hand
offends you.

267
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:17,263
I'm just bored with it.
The aggressive hospitality,

268
00:26:17,264 --> 00:26:22,264
the arrogance of stupid people who insist
you should be as stupid as they are.

269
00:26:22,306 --> 00:26:26,096
It's death to farm out here.

270
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:30,013
It's worse than death in the mines.

271
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:35,014
D0 you want them
to sing opera as well?

272
00:26:36,764 --> 00:26:40,721
And what do you do?

273
00:26:40,722 --> 00:26:45,722
Idrink.

274
00:26:48,597 --> 00:26:53,180
This beer's gone warm.

275
00:26:53,181 --> 00:26:58,181


276
00:26:58,931 --> 00:27:03,471
- (Man) Heads.
- (Crowd clamouring)

277
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:05,513
Here you are, Doc.

278
00:27:05,514 --> 00:27:07,180
Thanks, Joe.

279
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:09,763
It's a spinner's night,
nearly two-to-one on heads.

280
00:27:09,764 --> 00:27:13,513
- Good on you, Doc.
- Good on you...

281
00:27:13,514 --> 00:27:18,514
Mate.

282
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:37,931
You want to bet on tails, son?

283
00:27:38,472 --> 00:27:43,472
Fifty for the guy in the jacket
over there, Slim.

284
00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:49,596
Fair go.

285
00:27:49,597 --> 00:27:52,930
When you're ready there, Brian.

286
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:54,763
N0 betting when I say fair go.

287
00:27:54,764 --> 00:27:57,680
Fair go, Brian.

288
00:27:57,681 --> 00:28:00,888
Fair go.

289
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:05,889
(Controller) Two tails!

290
00:28:13,264 --> 00:28:15,388
(Man) Anybody seen
a bloke with a coat on?

291
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:17,180
Where's that bloke in a coat?

292
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:21,555
Here! Here.

293
00:28:21,556 --> 00:28:25,180
Thought I lost you, mate.

294
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:27,721
Move over!

295
00:28:27,722 --> 00:28:29,388
Sit down here, son.

296
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:31,096
How many heads up?

297
00:28:31,097 --> 00:28:32,471
Heads, heads! I bet on heads.

298
00:28:32,472 --> 00:28:34,805
Anyone betting 0n tails?

299
00:28:34,806 --> 00:28:36,138
N0, on heads.

300
00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:38,055
- Tails, 100!
- You're covered!

301
00:28:38,056 --> 00:28:40,638
- A hundred for you?
- Yes.

302
00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:44,971
- You're on a head.
- Any more tails?

303
00:28:44,972 --> 00:28:49,972
(Controller) Will you place your bets
and take your seats?

304
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:55,263
Sorry, son.

305
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:57,138
Be quiet!

306
00:28:57,139 --> 00:28:59,346
(Shushes)

307
00:28:59,347 --> 00:29:01,138
When you're ready for it.

308
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,346
Fair go.

309
00:29:03,347 --> 00:29:06,680
They're UP!

310
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:11,681
- Play for now.
- Hold it!

311
00:29:12,139 --> 00:29:17,139
- Heads!
- All right.

312
00:29:23,097 --> 00:29:24,388
When you're ready.

313
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:29,096
Don't forget, every Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday night!

314
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:32,180
Early start
Christmas Eve, boys!

315
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:36,138
Bring your own money,
anybody's girl.

316
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:39,596
Leaving it all on heads, mate?

317
00:29:39,597 --> 00:29:41,055
Two hundred on tails.

318
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:44,846
- I'll have 100.
- You're on.

319
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:46,888
- What are you backing, mate?
- Tails.

320
00:29:46,889 --> 00:29:48,888
You're set.

321
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:53,889
I'll back a head.
I'll back... You're up?

322
00:29:56,931 --> 00:29:58,638
Thanks, mate.

323
00:29:58,639 --> 00:30:00,513
You're too noisy!

324
00:30:00,514 --> 00:30:05,514
Fair go, spinner.
When you're ready.

325
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:12,389
One of each,
which is no result.

326
00:30:14,472 --> 00:30:16,305
Fair go.

327
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:21,306
Fair go!

328
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:29,389
Tails, they are!

329
00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:46,389
Whoo!

330
00:31:18,222 --> 00:31:23,222
(Exhales)

331
00:31:32,431 --> 00:31:37,431
(Sighs)

332
00:31:52,764 --> 00:31:57,764
(Books crash)

333
00:31:58,097 --> 00:32:00,513
$1,000.

334
00:32:00,514 --> 00:32:02,638
Just...

335
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:05,888
Just one more spin...

336
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:09,763
and you're out of it.

337
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:14,596
Out of teaching.

338
00:32:14,597 --> 00:32:19,597
Out of Tiboonda.

339
00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:23,138
(Clamouring)

340
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:24,388
(Controller) Toss, Terry?

341
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:26,263
Toss, Paulie? Toss?

342
00:32:26,264 --> 00:32:27,471
Toss, Mal?

343
00:32:27,472 --> 00:32:29,305
Who wants to toss?

344
00:32:29,306 --> 00:32:30,596
Yes!

345
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:35,597
Here you are, son.

346
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:45,639
How much you tossing for?

347
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:47,888
$400 on tails.

348
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:52,346
You can't spin for tails, mate.
The spinner always spins for heads.

349
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:54,555
- Heads.
- On a head.

350
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,430
Four hundred, Charlie.

351
00:32:56,431 --> 00:33:01,431
(Clamouring)

352
00:33:09,097 --> 00:33:14,097
Watch out, imbecile!
Watch where you're going, you mug.

353
00:33:17,472 --> 00:33:22,430
(Controller)
When you're right now.

354
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:24,763
Come on,
out of the ring, you blokes.

355
00:33:24,764 --> 00:33:28,763
Fair go, son.

356
00:33:28,764 --> 00:33:33,721
Heads.

357
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:36,555
Settle down!

358
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,055
N0, son. You gotta put 'em
above your head and spin it, all right?

359
00:33:39,056 --> 00:33:42,555
I'm sorry.

360
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:44,805
When you're right now.

361
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:48,513
Wait for it now.

362
00:33:48,514 --> 00:33:53,514
When you're right.
Fair go.

363
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:05,889
Tails, two tails.

364
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:46,346
What, still here, Jack?

365
00:34:46,347 --> 00:34:49,430
- Hmm? Mmm.
- How goes it?

366
00:34:49,431 --> 00:34:51,638
Well, Jock.

367
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,888
Look, um, will they
cash a check for me in this place?

368
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:57,055
Yeah, for how much?

369
00:34:57,056 --> 00:34:59,263
Two hundred and ninety dollars.

370
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,471
- Gonna try the game, eh?
- Yes.

371
00:35:01,472 --> 00:35:04,346
(Laughing)

372
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:09,347
- Two-ninety on heads.
- (All laughing)

373
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:19,805
Well, he's on heads now.

374
00:35:19,806 --> 00:35:21,430
(indistinct)

375
00:35:21,431 --> 00:35:22,888
What are you betting on, mate?

376
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:27,889
- Two-ninety on heads.
- You're on.

377
00:36:15,222 --> 00:36:20,222
(Chickens clucking)

378
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:06,971
Can you... Can you tell me
where the labour exchange is?

379
00:37:06,972 --> 00:37:10,013
Turn left as you go out,
second street, turn right,

380
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:15,014
next street,
turn left, it's on the right.

381
00:38:08,847 --> 00:38:13,847
(Statue laughing)

382
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:18,971
(Tyres screeching)

383
00:38:18,972 --> 00:38:23,972
(Horn honking)

384
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:14,805
Yeah, so I say to this mug, I said,

385
00:39:14,806 --> 00:39:17,013
"You better get out.
You're barred from the pub.

386
00:39:17,014 --> 00:39:18,930
"Every time you come in here,
you put on trouble."

387
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:20,346
And then, all of a sudden,
he turned it on.

388
00:39:20,347 --> 00:39:22,721
I grabbed him by the scruff of the neck
and I hit him.

389
00:39:22,722 --> 00:39:26,055
Done the knuckle in.
Knuckle's squished up back here.

390
00:39:26,056 --> 00:39:30,430
Yeah, it's been six weeks.

391
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:32,971
All these mugs I get in here.
They want to try you out.

392
00:39:32,972 --> 00:39:37,972
They all come from far and wide
to try you out.

393
00:39:44,306 --> 00:39:47,471
(Man) Hot?

394
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:51,096
Hot.

395
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,721
- New to the Yabba?
- (Sighs)

396
00:39:53,722 --> 00:39:58,721
New to the Yabba.

397
00:39:58,722 --> 00:40:01,638
Like the old place?

398
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:04,221
N0, I think it's bloody awful.

399
00:40:04,222 --> 00:40:09,222
- You don't like the Yabba?
- N0.

400
00:40:20,472 --> 00:40:21,971
Will you have a drink?

401
00:40:21,972 --> 00:40:24,346
N0, I'm toying
with this one, thanks.

402
00:40:24,347 --> 00:40:26,346
Well, drink it down,
I'll buy you another.

403
00:40:26,347 --> 00:40:28,430
Look, I'm flat broke
and I can't afford to drink!

404
00:40:28,431 --> 00:40:29,888
What's that got to do
with it, man?

405
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:32,763
I said I'd buy you a drink!
You don't have to buy <i>me</i> one!

406
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:37,764
Now, drink it down!

407
00:40:45,889 --> 00:40:49,471
Two middies, Keith.
Don't forget the tomato juice.

408
00:40:49,472 --> 00:40:53,721
I'm Tim Hynes.

409
00:40:53,722 --> 00:40:58,430
John Grant.

410
00:40:58,431 --> 00:41:01,471
Hey. Good shot.

411
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:02,971
Are you a Mason?

412
00:41:02,972 --> 00:41:05,555
What? N0!

413
00:41:05,556 --> 00:41:07,096
You're in the Buffs.

414
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,805
- In the what?
- In the Buffs.

415
00:41:09,806 --> 00:41:12,763
The Buffs?

416
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:15,430
Are you a member
of the Buffalo Lodge?

417
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:19,138
(Laughing) N0.
Never heard of it.

418
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:21,888
- Not a Mason, not a Buff.
- N0.

419
00:41:21,889 --> 00:41:24,180
Ah, you'll be
a Roman Catholic, then.

420
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:27,638
Oh, no, I'm not.

421
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:32,639
Well, what are you going to do?

422
00:41:35,431 --> 00:41:36,805
You're not a Buff?

423
00:41:36,806 --> 00:41:39,346
Iam not a Buff.

424
00:41:39,347 --> 00:41:41,138
Poor old John.

425
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:42,596
Poor old John.

426
00:41:42,597 --> 00:41:45,721
Well, we better
have another beer.

427
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:47,430
Hey!

428
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:49,180
I was just checking your oil.

429
00:41:49,181 --> 00:41:53,221
(Laughing)

430
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:54,805
Now, come on, John.

431
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:56,388
Hey, Keith,
a couple of beers!

432
00:41:56,389 --> 00:42:00,055
(Laughing)

433
00:42:00,056 --> 00:42:01,930
(Tim) Well, here we are, John.

434
00:42:01,931 --> 00:42:06,931
- Home, sweet home.
- (John) Uh-huh!

435
00:42:16,181 --> 00:42:17,805
(Exhales)

436
00:42:17,806 --> 00:42:19,180
(Grunts)

437
00:42:19,181 --> 00:42:23,846
Grab yourself a seat, John,
I'll tell Janette we're here.

438
00:42:23,847 --> 00:42:26,596
Janette!
Put these in the fridge, will you?

439
00:42:26,597 --> 00:42:31,597
Oh, I brought a friend back,
so set another place for lunch, will you?

440
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:11,096
Oh!

441
00:43:11,097 --> 00:43:13,555
(Chuckles)

442
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:16,305
How do you do?

443
00:43:16,306 --> 00:43:18,263
Fine.

444
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:23,264
How are you?

445
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:27,930
I really must apologise
for landing on you like this.

446
00:43:27,931 --> 00:43:31,096
Mr Hynes more 0r less insisted.

447
00:43:31,097 --> 00:43:36,097
He usually does.

448
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:03,514
Oh, my name's John Grant.

449
00:44:15,056 --> 00:44:20,056
I'm Janette Hynes.

450
00:44:36,556 --> 00:44:38,763
Oh.

451
00:44:38,764 --> 00:44:43,764
Thanks.

452
00:44:49,056 --> 00:44:54,056
(Toilet flushes)

453
00:44:55,764 --> 00:44:58,638
(Tim vocalising)

454
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:02,221
Over the teeth and round the gums,
look out belly, here it comes!

455
00:45:02,222 --> 00:45:04,221
(Laughing)

456
00:45:04,222 --> 00:45:05,930
Just a little quickie before lunch.

457
00:45:05,931 --> 00:45:07,638
Lunch is ready now, Daddy.

458
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,305
I know.

459
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:12,263
But firstly, John and I
must have an apéritif.

460
00:45:12,264 --> 00:45:15,513
(Laughing)

461
00:45:15,514 --> 00:45:17,888
Ah.

462
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:19,971
John, old man,

463
00:45:19,972 --> 00:45:22,596
about your troubles,

464
00:45:22,597 --> 00:45:26,513
a terrible thing,
you losing all that money.

465
00:45:26,514 --> 00:45:27,846
You have no idea...

466
00:45:27,847 --> 00:45:30,638
N0, it was somewhere
between the train and the hotel.

467
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:32,513
Hmm.

468
00:45:32,514 --> 00:45:35,138
I could put a call
through to Sydney.

469
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:40,139
N0, there's no one there
I could borrow from.

470
00:45:43,264 --> 00:45:45,346
John, I'd love to lend you some...

471
00:45:45,347 --> 00:45:49,138
N0, no. No, no, no.
I wouldn't, really, I'll be all right.

472
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:52,846
Ah, you're a good bloke.

473
00:45:52,847 --> 00:45:54,805
We'll think of something.

474
00:45:54,806 --> 00:45:56,846
Now, don't you worry, lad.

475
00:45:56,847 --> 00:45:59,388
- Right.
- And drink up.

476
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:04,305
Drink up.

477
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:09,306
(Snoring)

478
00:46:09,347 --> 00:46:14,347
(Horn honking)

00:46:15,097 --> 00:46:16,305

481
00:46:17,972 --> 00:46:20,555
- (Man shouts) Wake up, Tim!
- (Men laughing)

482
00:46:20,556 --> 00:46:24,180
Well, that's... That's Dick and Joe,
couple of old mates of mine.

483
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:25,763
I want you to meet them.

484
00:46:25,764 --> 00:46:28,471
Come on in, boys.
Come 0n in. (Laughing)

485
00:46:28,472 --> 00:46:31,721
- Am I glad to see you!
- You look bloody awful, mate.

486
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:34,971
- I feel bloody awful! (Laughing)
- Hey!

487
00:46:34,972 --> 00:46:36,888
T00 much of the old booze.

488
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:38,805
Oh, cut it out, boys, will you?
Stop it!

489
00:46:38,806 --> 00:46:40,180
Hey. Let's all have a drink.

490
00:46:40,181 --> 00:46:41,805
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
- What, what?

491
00:46:41,806 --> 00:46:44,471
- Who's your mate?
- Who? Oh, he... Oh, that's John.

492
00:46:44,472 --> 00:46:47,930
- This is, uh, Dick and Joe.
- You're an ignorant bludger.

493
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:51,471
- G'day.
- How are you?

494
00:46:51,472 --> 00:46:53,096
- G'day, John.
- How are you?

495
00:46:53,097 --> 00:46:58,097
- (Crushes hand)
- (Laughs)

496
00:46:59,097 --> 00:47:02,263
Uh, you're new to the Yabba,
are you, John?

497
00:47:02,264 --> 00:47:07,264
- Yes. Yes.
- Hmm.

498
00:47:07,472 --> 00:47:12,472
(Wolf whistling)

499
00:47:12,889 --> 00:47:14,430
G'day, Janette.

500
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:19,431
Pretty as ever, eh?

501
00:47:20,264 --> 00:47:25,264
(Laughing)

502
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:29,638
(Laughing)

503
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:31,638
Missed me.

504
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:36,346
Tim, I'll be moving off now.
Thanks for your hospitality.

505
00:47:36,347 --> 00:47:38,555
Moving off?

506
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:39,971
Where would you be going, lad?

507
00:47:39,972 --> 00:47:42,138
Well, I've...

508
00:47:42,139 --> 00:47:44,971
- Well, I've gotta look for work.
- On a Saturday?

509
00:47:44,972 --> 00:47:47,846
Look, why don't you just
hang around?

510
00:47:47,847 --> 00:47:52,847
We'll fix you up.

511
00:47:54,097 --> 00:47:57,971
Look, just drink your beer,
sit down.

512
00:47:57,972 --> 00:48:02,972
Stop worrying, huh?

513
00:48:03,306 --> 00:48:06,096
John's got a bit of trouble,
but nothing to worry about.

514
00:48:06,097 --> 00:48:08,805
Should be all right, mate.
Drink up.

515
00:48:08,806 --> 00:48:13,806
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

516
00:48:16,764 --> 00:48:21,764
Hey.

517
00:48:27,222 --> 00:48:30,513
(Chuckles)

518
00:48:30,514 --> 00:48:32,055
- Hey, Tim.
- Yeah?

519
00:48:32,056 --> 00:48:34,763
I got news for you, mate.

520
00:48:34,764 --> 00:48:37,555
What do you think?

521
00:48:37,556 --> 00:48:40,263
- You got piles.
- (Laughs)

522
00:48:40,264 --> 00:48:43,013
N0, no, no, no.
You know Stanley's brindle bitch?

523
00:48:43,014 --> 00:48:46,055
- Yeah.
- Sold her to me. English bred.

524
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:48,305
- You're a liar.
- It's the truth.

525
00:48:48,306 --> 00:48:49,721
She's got a broken leg.

526
00:48:49,722 --> 00:48:52,180
I'm not ribbing you, mate,
he sold her to me.

527
00:48:52,181 --> 00:48:54,763
A great dog. A great dog!

528
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:56,638
A great dog.

529
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:59,846
- Good dog.
- (Dick) Come off it, mate.

530
00:48:59,847 --> 00:49:03,513
This'll be one of the best bloody dogs
I've ever seen after roos.

531
00:49:03,514 --> 00:49:06,305
Eh?

532
00:49:06,306 --> 00:49:07,846
(Tim) You've gotta be kidding!

533
00:49:07,847 --> 00:49:12,847
- (Joe laughing)
- What makes a good dog?

534
00:49:12,972 --> 00:49:17,972
Can I help you?

535
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,930
(Tim) S0, we let this ferret
go down the rabbit's burrow...

536
00:49:20,931 --> 00:49:24,763
(John) I studied
history and literature.

537
00:49:24,764 --> 00:49:26,013
And what can you do with that

538
00:49:26,014 --> 00:49:30,013
if your parents are nobody
and you have no money?

539
00:49:30,014 --> 00:49:34,013
Oh, I know I can teach, but...

540
00:49:34,014 --> 00:49:36,596
I'd really like
to get to England.

541
00:49:36,597 --> 00:49:40,221
Well, this is bad enough,
but even Sydney, it's...

542
00:49:40,222 --> 00:49:42,013
(Sighs)

543
00:49:42,014 --> 00:49:45,596
I'd really like
to get to England.

544
00:49:45,597 --> 00:49:48,513
What would you do there?

545
00:49:48,514 --> 00:49:51,513
Journalism.

546
00:49:51,514 --> 00:49:55,180
- D0 you have a girl?
- Yes, in Sydney.

547
00:49:55,181 --> 00:49:56,888
What's her name?

548
00:49:56,889 --> 00:49:59,846
Robyn.

549
00:49:59,847 --> 00:50:02,721
Robyn.

550
00:50:02,722 --> 00:50:07,722
What's she like?

551
00:50:27,139 --> 00:50:32,139
Robyn.

552
00:50:35,306 --> 00:50:38,763
Would you take her
to England with you?

553
00:50:38,764 --> 00:50:42,180
Yes.

554
00:50:42,181 --> 00:50:47,181
Yes.

555
00:50:48,056 --> 00:50:50,513
(Tim burping)

556
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:53,180
- Ooh! Bells of St Mary's.
- Hey, hey, hey.

557
00:50:53,181 --> 00:50:55,013
Yeah?

558
00:50:55,014 --> 00:50:57,888
What's the matter with him?
He'd rather talk to a woman than drink?

559
00:50:57,889 --> 00:50:59,555
School teacher.

560
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,263
Oh.

561
00:51:02,264 --> 00:51:05,721
(Tim) Then we agreed, before
the game started, there was a $5 limit.

562
00:51:05,722 --> 00:51:07,930
- (Laughing)
- (Joe) N0, there was no agreement, mate.

563
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:09,971
- (Dick laughing)
- (Tim) Wait, wait, was that...

564
00:51:09,972 --> 00:51:13,388
Look, what's the matter with you?

565
00:51:13,389 --> 00:51:15,221
(Dick) There was
no agreement made.

566
00:51:15,222 --> 00:51:17,388
(Joe) G0 on, you blokes, just...

567
00:51:17,389 --> 00:51:18,888
(Dick) Was there any
bloody agreement made?

568
00:51:18,889 --> 00:51:20,096
(Joe) I don't know.
(Dick) N0.

569
00:51:20,097 --> 00:51:22,138
(Tim) I hate to remind
you this is my house...

570
00:51:22,139 --> 00:51:26,096
(All arguing at once)

571
00:51:26,097 --> 00:51:28,055
(Joe) You're always
bloody interrupting.

572
00:51:28,056 --> 00:51:31,680
It's got nothing to do
with whose bloody house it is.

573
00:51:31,681 --> 00:51:33,846
Doc Tydon, you old bastard.

574
00:51:33,847 --> 00:51:36,180
- How do you know that?
- (Laughing) Great to see you.

575
00:51:36,181 --> 00:51:37,430
Hi, boys.

576
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:39,930
Have yourself a beer,
I got five aces coming up.

577
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:43,888
If you're playing cards with this lot,
you'll need a doctor before the night is out.

578
00:51:43,889 --> 00:51:48,889
(Banter continues inside)

579
00:51:54,056 --> 00:51:58,221
Why do you stay
in Bundanyabba?

580
00:51:58,222 --> 00:52:01,221
N0, I'm surprised,
I mean, you're...

581
00:52:01,222 --> 00:52:02,638
pretty and...

582
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:07,639
And there's a shortage
of pretty girls in this town.

583
00:52:16,681 --> 00:52:20,138
(Sniffs)
Ah, it's beautiful. Smell that.

584
00:52:20,139 --> 00:52:22,096
Peppercorn.

585
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:27,097
(Chuckles)

586
00:52:27,514 --> 00:52:32,514
ls it because of your father?

587
00:52:37,847 --> 00:52:42,847
Sorry.

588
00:52:44,556 --> 00:52:49,556
The moonlight like snow
upon the desert's dusty face.

589
00:52:49,764 --> 00:52:54,764
(Chuckles)

590
00:53:04,597 --> 00:53:06,638
All right, Dicky boy,
let's hear from you.

591
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:08,346
- What've you got?
- Three jacks, mate.

592
00:53:08,347 --> 00:53:10,013
Ah-ha! Well, just hold it,
hold it, hold it.

593
00:53:10,014 --> 00:53:12,013
- Daddy?
- Flush.

594
00:53:12,014 --> 00:53:13,263
Daddy?

595
00:53:13,264 --> 00:53:14,971
John and I are going for a walk.

596
00:53:14,972 --> 00:53:17,346
Well, come on, come on, come on,
get me while I'm hot, boys.

597
00:53:17,347 --> 00:53:22,347
An inside showing all the time.

598
00:53:54,847 --> 00:53:59,847
(Janette breathing heavily)

599
00:55:02,972 --> 00:55:07,972
(Moaning)

600
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,013
(G ru nting)

601
00:55:11,014 --> 00:55:16,014
(Retching)

602
00:55:18,222 --> 00:55:23,222
(Vomiting)

603
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:59,389
(Coughs)

604
00:56:19,222 --> 00:56:22,846
(Laughing)

605
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:24,638
(Doc) It's not the gravity.

606
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:27,346
It's not the gravity
that makes the beer go down.

607
00:56:27,347 --> 00:56:29,513
- It's peristalsis.
- Perry who?

608
00:56:29,514 --> 00:56:32,096
- Perry Mason.
- (All laughing)

609
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:37,097
Peristalsis. It's the contraction
of the muscles of the oesophagus.

610
00:56:37,597 --> 00:56:41,596
Come on, Doc, get up, man!
Come on.

611
00:56:41,597 --> 00:56:43,096
(Laughing)

612
00:56:43,097 --> 00:56:45,305
Whoa, whoa!

613
00:56:45,306 --> 00:56:50,306
(Laughing)

614
00:56:51,222 --> 00:56:53,180
(Squirting)

615
00:56:53,181 --> 00:56:54,680
(Chuckles)

616
00:56:54,681 --> 00:56:56,138
(Man) It'll be a week for sure.

617
00:56:56,139 --> 00:56:59,138
(Tim) Hey, Doc, Doc?
Come in over here.

618
00:56:59,139 --> 00:57:02,096
Look, Doc, when is she
gonna whelp, huh?

619
00:57:02,097 --> 00:57:04,930
I tell you what,
I'll give you five it's a week, Joe.

620
00:57:04,931 --> 00:57:07,305
Listen to the Doc.

621
00:57:07,306 --> 00:57:08,638
She's not pregnant.

622
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:10,763
(Laughing)

623
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:13,971
Cut it out, Doc, come on.
When's she gonna whelp?

624
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,305
- Who's the father?
- (All laugh)

625
00:57:16,306 --> 00:57:18,221
It's a dog, not a sheep.

626
00:57:18,222 --> 00:57:19,930
(All laughing)

627
00:57:19,931 --> 00:57:22,805
(Bleats)

628
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,305
She'll have pups by morning.

629
00:57:24,306 --> 00:57:26,430
- Beauty!
- N0 way, I bet it'll be a week.

630
00:57:26,431 --> 00:57:28,138
I don't feel anything.

631
00:57:28,139 --> 00:57:30,805
Come on, put your money out.
Five, right?

632
00:57:30,806 --> 00:57:32,555
- Five.
- You're on for five.

633
00:57:32,556 --> 00:57:37,556
Let's have a second opinion.

634
00:57:38,431 --> 00:57:40,638
Before morning.

635
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:42,555
- It'll be a week.
- You heard me say that.

636
00:57:42,556 --> 00:57:44,096
I didn't.

637
00:57:44,097 --> 00:57:45,846
Who is the father, anyway?

638
00:57:45,847 --> 00:57:47,346
I don't know.

639
00:57:47,347 --> 00:57:49,513
She's a slag, this little mutt,
she'd try anything.

640
00:57:49,514 --> 00:57:54,514
(Laughing)

641
00:58:33,806 --> 00:58:37,846
(Fly buzzing)

642
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:42,847
(G roans)

643
00:58:44,389 --> 00:58:49,389
(Flies buzzing)

644
00:59:14,264 --> 00:59:19,264
(G roans)

645
00:59:21,472 --> 00:59:26,472
(I Opera music playing)

646
00:59:51,347 --> 00:59:56,347
You drank yourself under the table
after your little episode with Janette.

647
00:59:58,306 --> 01:00:00,721
Get out.

648
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,596
Don't get upset.

649
01:00:02,597 --> 01:00:04,930
We've all had
our little episodes with Janette.

650
01:00:04,931 --> 01:00:09,931
(I Opera music continues playing)

651
01:00:10,931 --> 01:00:15,931
What a doll.

652
01:00:19,514 --> 01:00:21,138
Better.

653
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:22,680
You need a drink.

654
01:00:22,681 --> 01:00:24,430
Oh, no.
Water, please.

655
01:00:24,431 --> 01:00:27,555
Yabba water's only for washing.
Come on, drink it up.

656
01:00:27,556 --> 01:00:32,556
It's a bit flat.

657
01:00:39,472 --> 01:00:42,888
Come and get it.

658
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,346
Oh, no, thanks very much,
but I don't... (Chuckles)

659
01:00:45,347 --> 01:00:47,221
N0, I'm sure you don't.

660
01:00:47,222 --> 01:00:49,680
But you'd better eat it
just the same.

661
01:00:49,681 --> 01:00:52,430
Come on, sit down.

662
01:00:52,431 --> 01:00:57,431
SirJohn.

663
01:01:03,806 --> 01:01:06,305
Not too bad.

664
01:01:06,306 --> 01:01:11,306
Kangaroo.

665
01:01:22,181 --> 01:01:23,680
Want some sauce?

666
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:28,681
What time did the, um...
the, uh, party finish?

667
01:01:29,681 --> 01:01:31,888
About dawn.

668
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:34,180
And what time is it now?

669
01:01:34,181 --> 01:01:36,471
Round about four o'clock.

670
01:01:36,472 --> 01:01:41,388
Four?

671
01:01:41,389 --> 01:01:42,805
Look...

672
01:01:42,806 --> 01:01:46,013
Look, uh, thanks
for the hospitality.

673
01:01:46,014 --> 01:01:51,014
I'd better be going along now.

674
01:02:03,264 --> 01:02:08,264
You see, I'm the school teacher
at Tiboonda.

675
01:02:08,722 --> 01:02:12,221
And, um...

676
01:02:12,222 --> 01:02:16,305
Well, I lost all my money.

677
01:02:16,306 --> 01:02:19,138
Gambling.

678
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:22,471
Yeah, I know.

679
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:26,555
Why did you have to lie about it
to Tim Hynes?

680
01:02:26,556 --> 01:02:29,638
That's no disgrace here.

681
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:33,471
Well...

682
01:02:33,472 --> 01:02:36,846
Well, in any case,
I can't stay in your, um...

683
01:02:36,847 --> 01:02:40,388
cabin, indefinitely, can I?

684
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:43,221
It isn't mine.

685
01:02:43,222 --> 01:02:45,638
L'vejust lived here
for five years.

686
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:50,138
Anyway, you're better off here than
trying to sponge 0n men like Tim Hynes.

687
01:02:50,139 --> 01:02:51,888
- Sponge?
- Yeah,sponge.

688
01:02:51,889 --> 01:02:54,846
Sit down and eat your grub.

689
01:02:54,847 --> 01:02:57,013
You're gonna need it.

690
01:02:57,014 --> 01:02:59,971
We're going hunting
with Dick and Joe.

691
01:02:59,972 --> 01:03:01,763
Kangaroo.

692
01:03:01,764 --> 01:03:03,930
- Hunting?
- Yeah, you were...

693
01:03:03,931 --> 01:03:08,931
(Fly buzzing)
- ...boasting in your cups, and said...

694
01:03:10,389 --> 01:03:13,138
Good shot.

695
01:03:13,139 --> 01:03:17,680
You said you won a silver medal at school
for target shooting.

696
01:03:17,681 --> 01:03:21,930
- Huh?
- Remember?

697
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:24,805
You wouldn't have
an aspirin, would you?

698
01:03:24,806 --> 01:03:29,806
N0, I've got something better.

699
01:03:35,597 --> 01:03:37,971
This ought to
kill your headache

700
01:03:37,972 --> 01:03:40,805
and pep you up
a little bit as well.

701
01:03:40,806 --> 01:03:44,805
Wash it down
with some beer. Here.

702
01:03:44,806 --> 01:03:46,013
Oh, I'm allergic to...

703
01:03:46,014 --> 01:03:51,014
Ah, there's nothing in there to hurt you.
G0 on, man, swallow it down.

704
01:04:01,722 --> 01:04:04,513
What a voice.

705
01:04:04,514 --> 01:04:07,763
She just opens her mouth and...

706
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:10,055
And notes come floating out.

707
01:04:10,056 --> 01:04:13,721
Oh, sorry,
I don't smoke.

708
01:04:13,722 --> 01:04:16,638
Would you like to try it?

709
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:21,639
N0.

710
01:04:22,681 --> 01:04:27,681
You've been here five years?

711
01:04:30,097 --> 01:04:34,180
Shall I satisfy your curiosity?

712
01:04:34,181 --> 01:04:36,888
I'm a doctor of medicine.

713
01:04:36,889 --> 01:04:38,513
And a tramp by temperament.

714
01:04:38,514 --> 01:04:40,971
I'm also an alcoholic.

715
01:04:40,972 --> 01:04:43,596
My disease prevented me
from practising in Sydney,

716
01:04:43,597 --> 01:04:46,805
but out here it's scarcely noticeable.

717
01:04:46,806 --> 01:04:50,513
Certainly doesn't stop people
from coming to see me.

718
01:04:50,514 --> 01:04:54,805
I charge no fees
because I'm not interested in money.

719
01:04:54,806 --> 01:04:57,221
Anyway, I'm unreliable.

720
01:04:57,222 --> 01:05:02,222
But I'm accepted socially
because I'm an educated man...

721
01:05:02,681 --> 01:05:04,555
of character.

722
01:05:04,556 --> 01:05:05,721
(Closes fridge)

723
01:05:05,722 --> 01:05:08,471
I get my food from my friends.

724
01:05:08,472 --> 01:05:11,055
My requirements in beer.

725
01:05:11,056 --> 01:05:16,056
Which, with some measure of self-control,
is the only alcohol I allow myself.

726
01:05:17,181 --> 01:05:21,138
And you get along
without money altogether.

727
01:05:21,139 --> 01:05:25,221
It's possible to live forever in the Yabba
without money.

728
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:29,680
As you probably noticed,
some of the natives are very...

729
01:05:29,681 --> 01:05:34,681
hospitable.

730
01:05:45,181 --> 01:05:49,346
Take Janette for instance.

731
01:05:49,347 --> 01:05:51,971
Now there's a very interesting
biological case.

732
01:05:51,972 --> 01:05:56,221
If she were a man,
she'd be in jail for rape.

733
01:05:56,222 --> 01:05:58,305
(Chuckles)

734
01:05:58,306 --> 01:06:00,513
If I were to marry,
Janette's just the sort of girl...

735
01:06:00,514 --> 01:06:02,763
Excuse me.

736
01:06:02,764 --> 01:06:07,138
Uh, can you tell me
where the, um...

737
01:06:07,139 --> 01:06:08,930
Toilet?

738
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:10,555
Yes.

739
01:06:10,556 --> 01:06:15,556
Outside.

740
01:06:19,014 --> 01:06:22,180
I wouldn't recommend it.

741
01:06:22,181 --> 01:06:25,555
D0 it out here in the open.

742
01:06:25,556 --> 01:06:26,846
(Bird chirping)

743
01:06:26,847 --> 01:06:31,847
NO one around to see.

744
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:39,888
If I were ever to marry,

745
01:06:39,889 --> 01:06:44,889
Janette's the sort of girl
I'd like to marry.

746
01:06:45,556 --> 01:06:47,471
She likes sex.

747
01:06:47,472 --> 01:06:52,472
She likes to experiment
and she likes variety.

748
01:06:53,472 --> 01:06:55,471
We thought about
getting married once,

749
01:06:55,472 --> 01:07:00,388
but neither of us could live
with one person for very long.

750
01:07:00,389 --> 01:07:04,180
Still, she visits me
from time to time.

751
01:07:04,181 --> 01:07:07,305
When I want her.

752
01:07:07,306 --> 01:07:12,306
And when she gets bored
with them.

753
01:07:16,806 --> 01:07:21,806
Beer?

754
01:07:23,681 --> 01:07:28,681
What's wrong with a woman
taking a man because she feels like it?

755
01:07:29,014 --> 01:07:32,930
- I really don't know.
- Because there's nothing wrong with it.

756
01:07:32,931 --> 01:07:34,638
Sex is just like eating.

757
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:36,930
It's a thing you do
because you have to.

758
01:07:36,931 --> 01:07:40,388
Not 'cause you want to,
but most people are afraid of it.

759
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:44,138
You seem offended
by my little discussion ofjanette.

760
01:07:44,139 --> 01:07:47,096
In the circumstances,
I thought you'd be interested.

761
01:07:47,097 --> 01:07:48,430
Well, I'm not.

762
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:51,263
You're probably a little puritan.

763
01:07:51,264 --> 01:07:53,805
Like the rest of these people.

764
01:07:53,806 --> 01:07:57,971
They think Janette's a slut.

765
01:07:57,972 --> 01:08:01,388
The women who'd like
to act like her...

766
01:08:01,389 --> 01:08:06,389
and the men
she has given a tumble to.

767
01:08:07,181 --> 01:08:10,805
Janette and I are alike.

768
01:08:10,806 --> 01:08:13,138
We break the rules.

769
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:15,846
But we know more
about ourselves than most people.

770
01:08:15,847 --> 01:08:20,847
(Exhales)

771
01:08:28,056 --> 01:08:29,430
(Horn honking)

772
01:08:29,431 --> 01:08:32,846
(DiCk) Hey, Doc! Doc!

773
01:08:32,847 --> 01:08:36,763
- Come on!
- Make a bit of noise, boys, will you?

774
01:08:36,764 --> 01:08:38,930
- Hi, Dick.
- (Both laughing)

775
01:08:38,931 --> 01:08:40,596
(Doc) Hey, Joe.
(Joe) In the back, fellas.

776
01:08:40,597 --> 01:08:44,513
Get back there.

777
01:08:44,514 --> 01:08:49,388
(All chattering)

778
01:08:49,389 --> 01:08:52,263
Hey, John.
I got a gun here for you.

779
01:08:52,264 --> 01:08:54,763
A bit old, probably
blow your head off.

780
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:59,764
(Tyres screeching)

781
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:05,096
(Man) Whoo-hoo!

782
01:09:05,097 --> 01:09:06,930
Look at her go there, boys!

783
01:09:06,931 --> 01:09:11,931
(Yelling)

784
01:09:18,347 --> 01:09:23,347
(Gun firing)

785
01:09:24,431 --> 01:09:27,971
(Laughing)

786
01:09:27,972 --> 01:09:32,972
Watch out the dog
doesn't leak on you, Johnny.

787
01:09:38,472 --> 01:09:39,930
(Man shouts) Roos!

788
01:09:39,931 --> 01:09:44,931
G0 on!
Get the bludgers!

789
01:09:45,972 --> 01:09:50,972
(All clamouring)

790
01:09:54,014 --> 01:09:55,721
(Engine revving)

791
01:09:55,722 --> 01:10:00,722
(Dick) Look at him go!

792
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:03,596
Get him!

793
01:10:03,597 --> 01:10:04,888
Hey!

794
01:10:04,889 --> 01:10:09,889
G0on!G0on!

795
01:10:11,097 --> 01:10:16,097
He's got him, he's got him!

796
01:10:20,931 --> 01:10:25,931
(All cheering)

797
01:10:38,514 --> 01:10:43,514
What are you doing?
You want to take my bloody head off?

798
01:10:44,347 --> 01:10:47,596
(Dick) Look at him go!

799
01:10:47,597 --> 01:10:52,597
Get him! Get him!

800
01:10:53,056 --> 01:10:56,055
(Laughing)

801
01:10:56,056 --> 01:11:00,763
(Dick) Look at him go,
will you?

802
01:11:00,764 --> 01:11:05,764
Look at him go!

803
01:11:13,806 --> 01:11:18,806
(Fires)

804
01:11:23,181 --> 01:11:25,846
Hey, Socrates.
You got a shot in yet?

805
01:11:25,847 --> 01:11:30,847
(Laughing)

806
01:11:31,431 --> 01:11:36,431
(Fires)

807
01:11:40,806 --> 01:11:45,806
(Yelling)

808
01:11:47,056 --> 01:11:48,888
(Laughing)

809
01:11:48,889 --> 01:11:50,721
(Joe) Get out.

810
01:11:50,722 --> 01:11:54,180
Beauty! It's a boomer.

811
01:11:54,181 --> 01:11:56,471
Knocked him out.
It's no good skinning him, eh?

812
01:11:56,472 --> 01:12:01,430
- Where's the surgeon?
- Here.

813
01:12:01,431 --> 01:12:03,055
Doc eats 'em.

814
01:12:03,056 --> 01:12:05,680
Reckon they're
the best part of the roo.

815
01:12:05,681 --> 01:12:08,055
- Haven't you ever tried them?
- N0.

816
01:12:08,056 --> 01:12:13,056
Better than oysters.
Put lead in your pencil.

817
01:12:16,806 --> 01:12:18,971
(Banging)

818
01:12:18,972 --> 01:12:21,513
- Any damage, sir?
- Ah, couple of dents.

819
01:12:21,514 --> 01:12:24,513
- All right, now, let's go.
- N0, no, let's get a drink.

820
01:12:24,514 --> 01:12:29,514
Uh, Johnny?

821
01:12:40,639 --> 01:12:42,805
(Car horn honking)

822
01:12:42,806 --> 01:12:46,305
(Doc) Why don't you try
driving faster, mate? (Laughing)

823
01:12:46,306 --> 01:12:48,263
Hey, Stubbsy.

824
01:12:48,264 --> 01:12:49,930
Hi, fellas.

825
01:12:49,931 --> 01:12:51,805
Stick it up your arse.

826
01:12:51,806 --> 01:12:53,555
Heya, mate.

827
01:12:53,556 --> 01:12:56,430
- You got any roos?
- N0, mate. Couple of boomers.

828
01:12:56,431 --> 01:12:58,430
- (Coughing)
- You blokes couldn't hit elephants.

829
01:12:58,431 --> 01:12:59,763
- Eh?
- Couldn't hit elephants.

830
01:12:59,764 --> 01:13:02,221
- We'll get 'em tonight with the spot.
- What's a spot?

831
01:13:02,222 --> 01:13:04,513
Spotlight,
it hypnotises them.

832
01:13:04,514 --> 01:13:05,805
- Hey, Stubbsy.
- Yeah?

833
01:13:05,806 --> 01:13:07,930
Stick these in your deep-freeze till tonight,
will you?

834
01:13:07,931 --> 01:13:09,055
(Sighs deeply)

835
01:13:09,056 --> 01:13:14,056
- Hope they're not yours, Doc.
- (Laughing)

836
01:13:18,181 --> 01:13:23,181
(Dick) Fox.

837
01:13:30,931 --> 01:13:32,388
Hey, I hit him!

838
01:13:32,389 --> 01:13:37,389
- (Dick) Hey, John, where you going?
- I hit him!

839
01:13:37,722 --> 01:13:40,763
It's no good skinning 'em, mate.
They're all mangy out here.

840
01:13:40,764 --> 01:13:45,764
Come on and drink your beer.

841
01:13:51,764 --> 01:13:56,555
Give us a tailor-made, Joe.

842
01:13:56,556 --> 01:14:01,556
(Burping)

843
01:14:02,306 --> 01:14:04,346
(John) You need any more drinks?
(Joe) I guess it's my shout.

844
01:14:04,347 --> 01:14:05,930
(John) Oh, no, no.

845
01:14:05,931 --> 01:14:07,680
This last round's on me.

846
01:14:07,681 --> 01:14:09,596
Nobody who's broke
buys beers in the Yabba.

847
01:14:09,597 --> 01:14:11,763
I'm not broke,
I've got a dollar.

848
01:14:11,764 --> 01:14:13,721
Forget it, John, forget it.

849
01:14:13,722 --> 01:14:16,596
- $1.
- Look.

850
01:14:16,597 --> 01:14:19,305
When you got some money,
you can take us on a bash.

851
01:14:19,306 --> 01:14:21,638
<i>'</i> Right?
<i>'</i> (mhn) Right.

852
01:14:21,639 --> 01:14:23,221
- Stubbsy?
- (Stubbs) Yeah.

853
01:14:23,222 --> 01:14:26,471
- Four more and four double whiskeys.
- (Stubbs) Right.

854
01:14:26,472 --> 01:14:28,138
And a packet of smokes
for the teacher.

855
01:14:28,139 --> 01:14:29,846
Three whiskeys, Dick.

856
01:14:29,847 --> 01:14:31,430
- Four.
- Three.

857
01:14:31,431 --> 01:14:34,138
- Four!
- Three.

858
01:14:34,139 --> 01:14:35,346
- Four!
- Three!

859
01:14:35,347 --> 01:14:38,555
Four!

860
01:14:38,556 --> 01:14:43,556
(Laughing)

861
01:15:28,889 --> 01:15:33,889
(Cocks rifle)

862
01:15:37,722 --> 01:15:42,722
(Guns firing)

863
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:21,096
(Man) Hey, you got her fair,
eh, Doc? (Laughs)

864
01:16:21,097 --> 01:16:23,471
Hey, Joe, take a look at this.
It's a beauty.

865
01:16:23,472 --> 01:16:27,763
(Joe) Yeah. He must be
a seven-footer for sure.

866
01:16:27,764 --> 01:16:29,305
(Laughs)

867
01:16:29,306 --> 01:16:34,306
G0 on, Dick.
We better cut up a few for the dogs, eh?

868
01:17:09,139 --> 01:17:12,346
The big fellow
just won't go down, Doc.

869
01:17:12,347 --> 01:17:14,055
Take us over there.

870
01:17:14,056 --> 01:17:16,471
- He kicks you, you're dead.
- Come on, take us over there.

871
01:17:16,472 --> 01:17:21,472
- Righto, mate!
- Let's go.

872
01:17:34,597 --> 01:17:36,971
Get stuck into him,
Joey boy.

873
01:17:36,972 --> 01:17:41,972
N0 worries!
(Laughing)

874
01:17:45,222 --> 01:17:49,846
(Kangaroo growling)

875
01:17:49,847 --> 01:17:51,388
See the way the roo's
trying to draw him in

876
01:17:51,389 --> 01:17:52,930
so he can get back
up on his tail, see?

877
01:17:52,931 --> 01:17:54,680
Yeah, and then he rips his guts out
with his hind legs like...

878
01:17:54,681 --> 01:17:59,681
- (Shushes)
- (Makes ripping sound)

879
01:18:19,222 --> 01:18:20,638
- (Cheering)
- All right!

880
01:18:20,639 --> 01:18:24,596
Yippee, Joey bOV!

881
01:18:24,597 --> 01:18:29,597
Come and get your beer, fella!
(Cheering)

882
01:18:33,389 --> 01:18:38,389
(Winces)

883
01:18:41,389 --> 01:18:44,180
Once you've got her by the tail,
it's as good as dead.

884
01:18:44,181 --> 01:18:45,721
- Have you ever done it, Joe?
- N0.

885
01:18:45,722 --> 01:18:46,846
- Dick?
- Eh?

886
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:48,263
- Have you ever done it?
- What?

887
01:18:48,264 --> 01:18:50,388
Oh, yeah,
hundreds of times.

888
01:18:50,389 --> 01:18:53,096
- Yeah, of course he's done it.
- I've done it!

889
01:18:53,097 --> 01:18:57,846
Why? D0 you want
to have a go, teacher?

890
01:18:57,847 --> 01:19:00,471
Why not?

891
01:19:00,472 --> 01:19:05,472
It's hard to prove.
I wouldn't do it.

892
01:19:05,889 --> 01:19:07,888
Yeah, it's all right,
Joe, I will.

893
01:19:07,889 --> 01:19:10,013
(Laughing)

894
01:19:10,014 --> 01:19:12,721
(Joe) You will?

895
01:19:12,722 --> 01:19:17,722
(Laughing)

896
01:19:19,889 --> 01:19:21,471
(G ru nting)

897
01:19:21,472 --> 01:19:26,472
(All laughing)

898
01:19:37,014 --> 01:19:39,596
What's the matter, teacher?
You scared?

899
01:19:39,597 --> 01:19:41,971
It's only a baby.
It's badly wounded.

900
01:19:41,972 --> 01:19:43,805
Have a go, you mug.

901
01:19:43,806 --> 01:19:48,806
(Others laughing)

902
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:56,513
(J09) G0 on, Johnny!

903
01:19:56,514 --> 01:19:58,638
(Dick) Come on, Johnny!

904
01:19:58,639 --> 01:20:01,680
G0 get him.

905
01:20:01,681 --> 01:20:04,346
(Grunts)

906
01:20:04,347 --> 01:20:09,347
He's trying to dance with him.

907
01:20:17,056 --> 01:20:18,763
(Joe) Come on.

908
01:20:18,764 --> 01:20:22,055
- Cut him through!
- The throat, Johnny!

909
01:20:22,056 --> 01:20:27,056
(Whimpering)

910
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:34,596
He's trying to beat
the thing to death.

911
01:20:34,597 --> 01:20:36,346
(Laughing)

912
01:20:36,347 --> 01:20:41,347
Through the throat, teacher.

913
01:20:45,014 --> 01:20:50,014
Come on, Johnny!

914
01:20:50,056 --> 01:20:53,013
(Cheering)

915
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:55,596
You beauty!

916
01:20:55,597 --> 01:20:57,221
Yippie!

917
01:20:57,222 --> 01:20:58,888
Well done.

918
01:20:58,889 --> 01:21:01,305
Yeah, that's it, Johnny.

919
01:21:01,306 --> 01:21:06,306
Now you're one of us.

920
01:21:09,597 --> 01:21:13,013
(Cheering and applauding)

921
01:21:13,014 --> 01:21:18,014
(Gun shots)

922
01:21:54,722 --> 01:21:59,722
(Glass shattering)

923
01:22:04,181 --> 01:22:09,181
You bloody maniacs!

924
01:22:13,639 --> 01:22:18,639
Bloody maniacs!

925
01:22:20,347 --> 01:22:25,347
I cannot accept your premise,
Socrates.

926
01:22:26,347 --> 01:22:28,721
Affectability?

927
01:22:28,722 --> 01:22:30,346
Progress?

928
01:22:30,347 --> 01:22:34,138
A vanity spawned by fear.

929
01:22:34,139 --> 01:22:35,596
(Whooping)

930
01:22:35,597 --> 01:22:40,597
A vanity spawned by fear.

931
01:22:45,389 --> 01:22:48,055
The aim of what you call civilization

932
01:22:48,056 --> 01:22:51,513
is a man in a smokingjacket,

933
01:22:51,514 --> 01:22:56,514
whiskey and cider,
pressing a bottom of...

934
01:22:56,681 --> 01:22:58,888
a <i>button...</i>

935
01:22:58,889 --> 01:23:03,889
to destroy a planet
a billion miles away,

936
01:23:04,056 --> 01:23:09,056
kill a billion people
he's never seen.

937
01:23:10,347 --> 01:23:11,971
Where are you?

938
01:23:11,972 --> 01:23:13,680
Come on!

939
01:23:13,681 --> 01:23:15,346
What happened?

940
01:23:15,347 --> 01:23:18,013
Hey, what happened
to Socrates?

941
01:23:18,014 --> 01:23:19,596
Where's Socrates?

942
01:23:19,597 --> 01:23:23,930
- What?
- Socrates!

943
01:23:23,931 --> 01:23:28,931
(Laughing)

944
01:23:31,014 --> 01:23:32,805
You bastard!

945
01:23:32,806 --> 01:23:35,305
(Yelling)

946
01:23:35,306 --> 01:23:38,263
(Glass shattering)

947
01:23:38,264 --> 01:23:40,430
N0, Joe!

948
01:23:40,431 --> 01:23:41,680
Stop it, you...

949
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:45,221
You murdering bastards.

950
01:23:45,222 --> 01:23:47,721
You bastards!

951
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:49,638
(Doc exclaiming drunkenly)

952
01:23:49,639 --> 01:23:54,639
Beat it, Doc.

953
01:23:59,806 --> 01:24:04,806
You murdering bastards!

954
01:24:06,556 --> 01:24:09,513
Bastard!

955
01:24:09,514 --> 01:24:14,514
You are...
(Exclaims drunkenly)

956
01:24:14,597 --> 01:24:19,597
(Yelling)

957
01:24:37,139 --> 01:24:40,055
(Struggling)

958
01:24:40,056 --> 01:24:43,596
(Yelling)

959
01:24:43,597 --> 01:24:45,305
I'll get you.

960
01:24:45,306 --> 01:24:48,305
- OK, you old hippie, get out!
- What's up?

961
01:24:48,306 --> 01:24:51,013
Oh, Stubbsy, you bastard.
It's only a party.

962
01:24:51,014 --> 01:24:53,680
(Stubbs) Bloody maniacs.

963
01:24:53,681 --> 01:24:58,681
What do you want with me, Doc?

964
01:25:05,722 --> 01:25:09,888
(Laughing)

965
01:25:09,889 --> 01:25:12,305
Bloody cow...

966
01:25:12,306 --> 01:25:14,013
You bloody coward!

967
01:25:14,014 --> 01:25:19,014
Whoa!

968
01:25:22,139 --> 01:25:25,180
(Laughing)

969
01:25:25,181 --> 01:25:30,181
(Grunts) Get off.

970
01:25:39,722 --> 01:25:41,846
I need to...
Refrigeration.

971
01:25:41,847 --> 01:25:46,847
(Laughing)

972
01:26:11,264 --> 01:26:13,055
<i>Doc...</i>

973
01:26:13,056 --> 01:26:16,930
Turn it off, turn it off.

974
01:26:16,931 --> 01:26:20,596
(Laughing)

975
01:26:20,597 --> 01:26:21,721
N0.

976
01:26:21,722 --> 01:26:26,722
N0, no... (Laughing)

977
01:26:31,347 --> 01:26:34,971
(lmitates slitting throat)

978
01:26:34,972 --> 01:26:39,972
(John grunts)

979
01:26:42,972 --> 01:26:47,972
(Doc laughing)

980
01:26:48,306 --> 01:26:51,388
(John grunts)

981
01:26:51,389 --> 01:26:56,389
(Both panting)

982
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:12,139
(Flies buzzing)

983
01:27:26,931 --> 01:27:31,931
(Snoring)

984
01:27:36,347 --> 01:27:41,347
(Doc snoring)

985
01:27:56,347 --> 01:28:01,347
(G roaning)

986
01:28:17,847 --> 01:28:20,846
Going?

987
01:28:20,847 --> 01:28:25,305
- Yes.
- Where?

988
01:28:25,306 --> 01:28:30,306
Syd neV-

989
01:28:34,347 --> 01:28:36,096
Syd neV-

990
01:28:36,097 --> 01:28:41,097
(Laughs)

991
01:28:44,014 --> 01:28:46,805
Want some...

992
01:28:46,806 --> 01:28:49,221
food before you go?

993
01:28:49,222 --> 01:28:51,305
N0.

994
01:28:51,306 --> 01:28:52,680
How about a drink?

995
01:28:52,681 --> 01:28:57,681
(Exhales)

996
01:28:58,431 --> 01:29:02,471
(Grunts)

997
01:29:02,472 --> 01:29:06,513
Hey, don't forget your gun.

998
01:29:06,514 --> 01:29:09,096
What?

999
01:29:09,097 --> 01:29:14,097
The boys made you
a present of the gun.

1000
01:29:23,931 --> 01:29:28,931
Bye.

1001
01:30:23,764 --> 01:30:25,471
Better?

1002
01:30:25,472 --> 01:30:29,638
Yes, better.

1003
01:30:29,639 --> 01:30:31,096
Thanks, mate.

1004
01:30:31,097 --> 01:30:32,721
Have another one.

1005
01:30:32,722 --> 01:30:34,305
<i>Oh...</i>

1006
01:30:34,306 --> 01:30:37,263
N0, I don't really like to.

1007
01:30:37,264 --> 01:30:42,264
One more beer,
thanks, Joyce.

1008
01:30:44,514 --> 01:30:46,513
Jock, you damn near
saved my life just now,

1009
01:30:46,514 --> 01:30:51,514
how about completing the job
by giving me a cigarette, huh?

1010
01:30:56,056 --> 01:31:01,056
Thanks.

1011
01:31:05,764 --> 01:31:09,555
I thought you were
pulling out of the Yabba on Saturday.

1012
01:31:09,556 --> 01:31:13,763
Hmm?
Oh, yes. Yes, I was.

1013
01:31:13,764 --> 01:31:17,263
What went wrong?

1014
01:31:17,264 --> 01:31:22,264
Oh, I got involved.

1015
01:31:25,597 --> 01:31:27,096
Hey, there's my suitcases.

1016
01:31:27,097 --> 01:31:30,346
- Yours, are they?
- Yes. I left them here yesterday.

1017
01:31:30,347 --> 01:31:32,846
N0.

1018
01:31:32,847 --> 01:31:36,263
N0, not yesterday.

1019
01:31:36,264 --> 01:31:39,388
- N0, it's the other day.
- They've been here since Saturday.

1020
01:31:39,389 --> 01:31:43,138
Look, ifJohn says they're his,
then they're his.

1021
01:31:43,139 --> 01:31:47,180
- What's in them, John?
- Oh, it's clothes.

1022
01:31:47,181 --> 01:31:52,181
Books.

1023
01:31:53,847 --> 01:31:58,847
(Man) Couple of schooners, Joyce.

1024
01:32:06,931 --> 01:32:09,180
(Jock) Like he said...

1025
01:32:09,181 --> 01:32:11,680
Books!

1026
01:32:11,681 --> 01:32:16,681
Not that I doubted you,
of course, John.

1027
01:32:26,889 --> 01:32:31,889
Is there anywhere
I can get a shower and shave?

1028
01:33:05,639 --> 01:33:10,639
Thanks, mate.

1029
01:35:14,514 --> 01:35:16,096
Right, thanks a lot.

1030
01:35:16,097 --> 01:35:17,930
- Come and have a drink, mate.
- N0, thanks.

1031
01:35:17,931 --> 01:35:19,471
- Come and have a drink.
- Not interested...

1032
01:35:19,472 --> 01:35:21,013
It will only take a minute.

1033
01:35:21,014 --> 01:35:22,305
Come on,
come and have a drink.

1034
01:35:22,306 --> 01:35:25,430
Look, mate,
I've given up drinking for a while.

1035
01:35:25,431 --> 01:35:27,805
What's wrong with you, you bastard?
Why don't you come and drink with me?

1036
01:35:27,806 --> 01:35:31,305
Ijust brought you 50 miles eating dust,
and you won't drink with me.

1037
01:35:31,306 --> 01:35:34,221
- What's wrong with you?
- What's the matter with you people, huh?

1038
01:35:34,222 --> 01:35:35,971
You sponge on you...

1039
01:35:35,972 --> 01:35:38,471
You burn your house down,
murder your wife,

1040
01:35:38,472 --> 01:35:40,221
rape your child, that's all right.

1041
01:35:40,222 --> 01:35:42,930
But don't have a drink with you,
don't have a flaming, bloody drink with you,

1042
01:35:42,931 --> 01:35:47,013
that's a criminal offence,
that's the end of the bloody world.

1043
01:35:47,014 --> 01:35:52,014
You're mad, you bastard.

1044
01:36:29,931 --> 01:36:31,388
G'day.

1045
01:36:31,389 --> 01:36:33,805
The gent here wants to know
who owns that semi-trailer.

1046
01:36:33,806 --> 01:36:38,806
(Man) Who wants to know?

1047
01:36:41,389 --> 01:36:44,013
Excuse me.

1048
01:36:44,014 --> 01:36:47,055
You, uh...
You own the semi-trailer?

1049
01:36:47,056 --> 01:36:48,430
What of it?

1050
01:36:48,431 --> 01:36:50,055
Well, nothing, uh...

1051
01:36:50,056 --> 01:36:55,056
I wanted to see
if you could give me a lift.

1052
01:36:57,181 --> 01:36:59,971
- Where you going?
- Right through.

1053
01:36:59,972 --> 01:37:03,263
- T0 the city, I mean.
- Well, I'm going to the city myself.

1054
01:37:03,264 --> 01:37:06,930
- Oh.
- How much is it worth?

1055
01:37:06,931 --> 01:37:10,180
Iam afraid I'm broke,
that's why I'm begging rides.

1056
01:37:10,181 --> 01:37:12,846
Should be worth at least
a couple of dollars.

1057
01:37:12,847 --> 01:37:16,346
Well, it would be, yes, but...
but I'm really flat.

1058
01:37:16,347 --> 01:37:21,347
Make it $2
and we're sweet.

1059
01:37:21,597 --> 01:37:26,597
Look, I've got $1.

1060
01:37:27,014 --> 01:37:29,638
I... I've got a rifle.
I'll give you that.

1061
01:37:29,639 --> 01:37:34,639
What sort of rifle?

1062
01:37:53,764 --> 01:37:57,180
All right,
you ride in the back.

1063
01:37:57,181 --> 01:37:59,388
OK. Thanks.

1064
01:37:59,389 --> 01:38:04,389
(Flies buzzing)

1065
01:38:22,889 --> 01:38:25,971
Hey, you, we're there.

1066
01:38:25,972 --> 01:38:30,972
There?

1067
01:38:40,556 --> 01:38:42,513
You know...

1068
01:38:42,514 --> 01:38:45,555
I thought you said
you were going to Sydney.

1069
01:38:45,556 --> 01:38:47,513
Don't know why.

1070
01:38:47,514 --> 01:38:50,263
You said city, mate.

1071
01:38:50,264 --> 01:38:55,264
Bundanyabba's a city, ain't it?

1072
01:38:57,222 --> 01:39:02,222
(Sighs)

1073
01:39:08,014 --> 01:39:13,014
Well, at least
the trip cost you nothing.

1074
01:39:16,597 --> 01:39:21,597
(Laughing)

1075
01:40:01,764 --> 01:40:06,764
(All laughing)

1076
01:40:17,222 --> 01:40:22,222
(Panting)

1077
01:41:10,806 --> 01:41:15,806
(Sobbing)

1078
01:42:23,389 --> 01:42:28,389
- Hey!
- (Gun fires)

1079
01:42:29,097 --> 01:42:34,097
(Heart beating)

1080
01:42:51,139 --> 01:42:54,388
I, uh, hate to trouble you, John,

1081
01:42:54,389 --> 01:42:57,721
but rather than tire you, I thought
I'd write down what had happened

1082
01:42:57,722 --> 01:43:00,721
and you could sign it, OK?

1083
01:43:00,722 --> 01:43:04,846
"The gunshot wound to my head
was the result of an accident.

1084
01:43:04,847 --> 01:43:08,971
"L was visiting my friend,
Clarence F. Tydon, after a hunting trip.

1085
01:43:08,972 --> 01:43:12,721
"L dropped my .22 rifle
at the floor of his kitchen butt first,

"believing it to be unloaded.

1087

"It exploded,
and that's all I remember."

1088
01:43:19,097 --> 01:43:24,096
That'll be about it,
wouldn't it?

1089
01:43:24,097 --> 01:43:29,097
Here.

1090
01:43:54,389 --> 01:43:58,888
(Siren wailing)

1091
01:43:58,889 --> 01:44:02,055
You'd think a bloke who'd won
a silver medal at target shooting

1092
01:44:02,056 --> 01:44:07,056
could hit himself in the head
at a range of three inches.

1093
01:44:08,764 --> 01:44:13,764
Give me that.

1094
01:44:21,264 --> 01:44:26,264
(Train horn sounding)

1095
01:44:41,014 --> 01:44:46,014
Don't wanna miss it.

1096
01:44:57,139 --> 01:45:02,139
(Train stops)

1097
01:45:13,806 --> 01:45:18,806
(Horn sounding)

1098
01:45:30,514 --> 01:45:32,513
Hey, mate.

1099
01:45:32,514 --> 01:45:35,930
- You like a beer?
- Oh.

1100
01:45:35,931 --> 01:45:40,931
- Thanks.
- Here's cheers.

1101
01:46:26,681 --> 01:46:27,971
Hello, Charlie.

1102
01:46:27,972 --> 01:46:31,638
Did you have a good holiday?

1103
01:46:31,639 --> 01:46:34,680
The best.
