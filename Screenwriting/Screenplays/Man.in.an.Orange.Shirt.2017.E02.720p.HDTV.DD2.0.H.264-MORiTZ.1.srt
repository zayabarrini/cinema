Thank you. Bless you, Rita.

Now he's had his boosters,
you can take him to the park

00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,921
so he can play with his friends.

Er, I... Claudie was
my girlfriend at uni.

Yeah, I am.

124
00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:18,717

I love how relaxed you Brits are.

126
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:27,045
I was told you'd be all uptight
and judgemental.

127
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:36,940
And two doubles with an overtrick.

I've just got to pee.

They've been on two dates now!

What, to the theatre?

No, to a hotel.

133

She's on some pills.

134
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:00,610
It certainly helps her card play.

135

I don't understand.

136

when I could quietly give up.

apologies, this is my round.

He better be worth it. Let me see.

152

657
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:09,919
very, very proud of you.

658
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,309
Oh, darling.

659
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:25,389
Thank you.

00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,741
"My darling Thomas. I'm at work.

663
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,288
"Nobody knows I'm writing to you here.

664
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:13,368
"You refuse my visits,

665
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,375
"so you're probably tearing up
my letters, too.

666
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,661
"But there's nothing else I can do
but keep trying.

667

"It's beyond my control, do you see?

668
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:29,875
"All those months ago, when I had
nothing to lose, really,

669
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,325
"I wrote to you in my head

670
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:34,259
"but was too cowardly
to set more than lies on paper.

671
00:57:35,881 --> 00:57:38,080
"And now, I find I no longer care.

672
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:44,759
"The love I feel for you runs
through me like grain through wood.

673

"I love you, Thomas.

674
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,795
"Your face, your voice, your touch

675
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:58,398
"enter my mind at the least
opportune moments

676
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:01,727
"and I find I have no power
to withstand them.

677
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:03,879
"No desire to.

678
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:10,465
"I want us to be together,
as we were in the cottage.

"Only for ever, not just a weekend.

680
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:21,254
"I want it to go on so long
that it feels normal.

681
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:25,261
"I think of you constantly.

682
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:28,309
"Your face, your breath
on my neck at night.

00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,395
"I want to do all the ordinary,

"un-bedroomy things
we never got around to doing.

"Making toast. Raking leaves.

"I see that now.

"Tell me I'm not too late."
