Once you start asking questions, you can't stop.
You see, good health makes a lot of sense, but it doesn't make a lot of dollars.
And not considering nutrition seriously, we've done a terrible disservice to all these people.
Every single person in the world, every culture, every language, every country, every person in the world knows it, you are what you eat.
Food does matter.
The Supermarket: symbol of the high standard of living in this country today.
These products come from farms and ranches despite distance and season.
They are the result of a miraculous agriculture, maintaining farm fresh quality all the way to your dinner table.
How old is your Food?
If you think about it, your food really, in the best of times is traveling between fifteen hundred and two thousand miles before you get it and is at least a week old.
Which becomes the next question:
How much nutrition value are you getting from food that's at least five days old?
And if you're lucky, you're getting maybe fourty percent of what you need.
Nearly every food that you'll find in the shops in a big city has been processed, it has been delayed to the shops quite often nutrients have deteriorated or disappeared from the food by the time gets onto the plate.
We, for whatever reason, decided we were going to spray everything with every kind of pesticide, herbicide, larvicide, fungicide, we decided we were going to genetically modify things we don't know anything about.
And one of the major problems is of course the soil and what we do to the soil and the air and the water and everything we take in our food.
Soils are used and used and used and nutrients are drawn out of the soils and the soils become new deserts and that's happening worldwide.
We do really need to look at our systems of agriculture and what we are really eating and how we are producing food.
The so-called fertilizer is made up of mainly three minerals:
N, P, K, nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium.
Well, that's nice, but, the problem is that the soil requires approximately fifty-two different minerals.
So where is the calcium and the magnesium and the manganese and the zinc and the iron and all of the other things I can't mention?
They're missing.
But when the soil is deficient the plants also are deficient and weakened, and they lose their defenses, and the bugs come and attack them and the diseases and fungus come and attack them.
So now they come crying to the chemical companies and they say well, our plants are dying and they won't grow and we have pests, and of course the chemical companies are terribly happy to sell them pesticides and fungicides and growth stimulants and all kinds of other things.
Through his intellect, man has developed a superiority over every other form of animal life.
From his modern chemistry, biology and dedicated research have come thousands of effective chemical compounds, all to help revolutionise the productivity of our own agriculture.
So what were getting even if we eat just commercial vegetarian food we get deficient toxic food because with all these pesticides and chemicals and sprays and all of that, the food is not healthy.
And its deficient.
So we can't help but be deficient and toxic.
And then...
Then we cook it!
And studies show that even if you lightly steam your food you are going to lose the enzymes that are in it.
The simplest thing is there are live enzymes or live workers inside of foods that help with your body's digestion of foods and the use of the nutrients that are there, so raw foods should be apart of everybody's diet.
When you cook food the immune system reacts to it as a toxin.
Most people don't know that.
When you cook your food the body goes through a process called digestive leukocytosis where it starts generating white cell activity against the cooked food you've eaten.
Presumably because the cooking process has bastardised the food structure.
In a way that the body cannot recognise, and so the body is now treating that food as a toxin.
That's not a good thing for your body to do to the food that you're hoping is going to nourish you.
There was a Swiss doctor by the name of Paul Kouchakoff who was the first to show in the 1930's that if you ate a diet that was more than fifty-one percent cooked food that your body would react to the food as if it was being invaded by a foreign organism.
Dr. Kouchakoff was the first to demonstrate that if fifty-one percent of your meals were raw that you would have no leukocytosis.
Or you would actually have no white blood cell reaction so your immune system would not be activated with a false alarm.
Because we are dealing with so many immune system issues today we have to make sure that at least fifty-one percent of every meal that we have is raw,
So that we don't overburden that already burdened immune system.
How can you build a building that you expect to last a hundred years if you put poor building materials in?
Same thing with your body, how can you expect your body to last for a long and enjoyable lifetime if you don't put the proper building blocks in there.
Everybody knows we are what we eat.
If you eat garbage you are going to get garbage.
Think of it as chronic malnutrition because that's what's going on.
That's why people look tired.
You are not supposed to be tired in the afternoon.
You are supposed to be alive and vibrant.
This has lead people naturally to discover super foods and to discover certain foods have an extraordinary quality of vitamins and minerals and all kinds of co factors and enzymes and special chemicals that for example, that will cause us to live longer, will cause our skin to be softer etc etc.
Spirulina was consumed in Mexico City as the primary protein source for five thousand years.
Spirulina is the highest protein content food in the world.
The Max Planck Institute discovered that fifty percent of protein is destroyed in any food once you cook the food.
Therefore, super food plant-based protein sources are going to be a key food of the future.
Because we can get all the protein that we need from those sources, they've been undamaged by heat and they are completely absorb able.
They can be liquified easily - that's what I am saying by absorb able.
How much energy do you think it takes to turn
Spirulina into a liquid and get it into your body?
Well you put Spirulina in water and it's already liquified, you drink it and it goes right into your cells like that.
But a steak requires a massive amount of energy to liquify it and make it absorb able by your digestive system.
These super foods can confer exceptional properties to your health and well being.
Cacao beans stack up on the mineral content against anything in the world.
It's the highest natural source of magnesium.
It's the highest natural source of chromium.
It's very likely the highest natural source of iron.
It's very likely the highest natural source of manganese.
It's one of the highest contents of zinc.
It's one of the highest contents of copper.
All the co factors needed for healthy metabolism - it's in the cacao bean.
It's one of the highest Vitamin
C content foods in the world but all processed chocolate has no Vitamin
C in it because heat destroys Vitamin C.
It has the highest anti-oxidant content that means that if we are really going to take advantage of what we have learned in nutrition that anti-oxidants protect us from
DNA damage, viral damage, cancer, protect us from skin damage etc etc.
It's either going to be this and then we eat or it's going to be this and then we eat.
And this right here could be the most horrid chemical soup of all time or it could be the most extraordinary super food of all time and it's the same amount of work to get it into our mouths.
We probably as a culture have got our values inverted.
We would rather spend our money on rent than we would on the best food ever.
We would rather spend money on a car or a house than on feeding our children the greatest super foods that have ever been discovered in the world because we don't know!
It's just a values inversion because we just got confused.
We saw some program that sold us on buying this car and suddenly we are buying that car, when really we should take that money and invest it into our families health by the best food ever which is the basis.
If I eat a lousy bread roll everyday, have a cup of tea for breakfast, and a piece of toast, a sugary drink for mid-morning, a donut for lunch and take away fried chicken at night,
I am going to be massively deficient in a whole range of nutrients, and that's only one day.
So I'm going to need something in the way of supplements.
So the next day I eat salad until it's coming out of my ears to try and make up for it but I never ever correct the deficiency that occurred from the day before.
There is always going to be a residual problem somewhere so you cannot punish yourselves without having to pay for it sooner or later.
We are lucky, in the last hundred years we went from not having any vitamin supplements to having them over the counter and readily available.
And yet most people don't know how important vitamins really are.
And if they take large enough doses they can use them to prevent illness and if they take large enough doses they can use them to treat illness.
Once again how can that be?
I didn't hear it on the news... in fact on the news it said,
"You shouldn't take too many of those vitamins, it might not be a good idea."
And yet they don't provide any evidence of that, they just say it.
Doctors say...
"I don't believe in vitamins."
Well...
We're not going to a shaman! We're supposed to be going with scientists here.
It's not about belief; it's about facts.
Over the last twenty-three years according to the
American Association of Poison Control Centers there have been ten- a total of ten deaths alleged to be caused by vitamins.
That's one zero, ten in twenty-three years.
That's less than half a death per year, and these are unproven, unverified but they are attributed to vitamin consumption.
We have a nation where the very thing that will help people is being presented as actually dangerous.
There have been studies that purport to show that if you take an extra multi vitamin everyday that it's going to hurt you.
And that's just nonsense.
There are studies that purport to say that
Vitamin C will cause a kidney stone.
Well, I have searched the medical literature and I've asked all my students to search the medical literature and my colleagues to search it and as soon as they find scientific evidence of a Vitamin C caused kidney stone, send me the paper. Send me the reference.
It's been thirty years and I’ve never gotten one.
Now either everybody is dumb...
...or it's a myth.
There is an assumption that vitamins are basically like drugs and should be regulated like drugs.
There is an assumption that if it's therapeutically valuable it must be dangerous because drugs are.
So we have been taught our whole lives to be consumers, mostly consumers to modern medicine, which is pharmaceutical medicine.
What about drugs that you get by prescription?
Well nowadays there are many powerful drugs that are not safe to take without a doctor's supervision but you can rely upon your doctor and your pharmacist.
They're both professionally trained men.
A druggist must have received training at an accredited college.
A doctor goes to a medical school, gets a medical education, practices medicine, prescribes medicines and is called an MD.
Well let's put nutrition into that and see how it sounds.
My doctor is a nutritionist who went to nutritional school, studied nutrition and has a nutritional degree and prescribes nutrients.
It sounds very strange.
When we say I went to the doctor it is implicit that the doctor was a medical doctor.
It surprised me in my clinical years that nobody was interested in the patients' diets when I spoke to my profs, they weren't interested in diets, the patients weren't interested in diets and neither were the hospitals so diet didn't come into it.
Whenever I mentioned it - nutrition - it was basically put to the side.
I spent time as a student at the
Brigham Hospital in Boston, which is right next to Harvard Med.
And this, even then back in
1974 it was a crisis hospital.
There were more doctors than patients.
It was really a grim place.
And I got a chance to see and observe the failure of medicine.
You would see people like the one woman I remember with Leukemia and they would give her
Jell-O and white bread to eat.
Now I am not saying that Jell-O and white bread caused cancer but they sure aren't the cure.
Twenty six percent of patients who are discharged from hospitals are more malnourished then when they went in.
And the reason they go in, in eighty to ninety percent of cases is related to their poor state of nutrition.
I started reading papers by William J.
McCormack and Frederick Robert Klenner; the pioneers of using high doses of Vitamin C and these gentlemen were curing viral disease with high doses of Vitamin C in the 1940's!
And then I had a poser.
Now just a minute here, hold on a second.
These are medical doctors and they're using vitamins and they're using high doses of vitamins and they're getting success.
But I didn't get any of this in college.
The medical profession, medical education, for that matter undergraduate education, common education through magazines and television, all manage to walk around the rhinoceros on the living room.
And I saw the rhinoceros in the living room and I said:
"Hey there is a rhinoceros in the living room!" and there it was right in the center this body of knowledge, this whole body of knowledge and the more I looked into it the more I found.
Linus Pauling first suggested that Vitamin
C could be useful against the common cold but this was based on quite a lot of science at the time and not just a guess or a whim.
Pauling was of course a colleague of Albert Einstein and quite a large number of other high level intellects of the time.
And he won two Nobel prizes: one in chemistry and one in peace.
So he is a brilliant man and should not be taken lightly.
The problem was that he was getting in the area of clinical medicine and he didn't have qualifications in this area and so he was at the time very open to criticism and his suggestion that Vitamin C would have an effect on the common cold was boo hoo'd by the medical profession.
And I must say that the medical profession is not always that scientific and clear thinking.
And the other thing that we have a problem here, a public relations problem with nutrients, is that one nutrient is good for too many things.
Vitamin E is good to fight heart disease, it's also good to put on burns, it's also good to help reduce seizures in teenagers that are Epileptic.
Now that's pretty diverse.
Vitamin C, let's see, anti-toxin, anti-histamine, anti-viral, helps regulate blood sugar, helps to elevate mood in people that are depressed, it's just too good for too many things and I have an answer.
The reason one vitamin can cure so many illnesses is because a deficiency of one vitamin can cause many illnesses.
There's only about two dozen nutrients and yet in your body there are countless thousands of chemical reactions.
So obviously anything that is vitamin mediated we can expect that one vitamin is going to be involved in multiple reactions.
This is true with the minerals as well.
We have an idea that one drug one disease; it's an old medical idea.
One drug, one disease; the doctoring of specifics.
And that is not true with nutrition.
You cannot heal selectively.
If you truly heal, everything heals.
If a patient comes for instance not only with cancer but with high blood pressure, and or diabetes and maybe fibromyalgia and other pains and so on...
...all the problems disappear.
You can't heal one disease and keep two others; it's impossible.
When the body heals, it heals everything.
You nourish the body and then the body fixes it.
When people take vitamins, the vitamins don't specifically do it they enable the body to do it, they enable the body to heal itself.
This is a totally different way of looking at it.
The body has what my father called it's own healing mechanism and he went further and said,
"It’s the doctors duty to activate and reactivate the body's own healing mechanism."
And the patients heal and it doesn't matter what you called the disease.
Not one cell in the human body is made out of a drug.
Surgery doesn't put anything into you.
They might put in something made of plastic; they might take out something that is harmful.
But in the end, cutting into the body doesn't really make it better.
Giving the body drugs doesn't really promote health.
So what we need is a new paradigm, we need a whole new way of looking at it.
Boosting health has not been tried yet, it's really kind of the one thing we haven't done.
When nutrients are tested as therapy they use very low doses and that's why the public and physicians see all these research papers that show ambiguous results.
One study is published and says vitamins help a little bit and another study is published that says vitamins don't help very much and you have this back and forth.
But the problem is because all of those studies are low dose studies.
The recommended daily allowance is the amount of a nutrient that's required by the majority of the population to prevent an overt deficiency disease.
That is if we give everybody in Australia the recommended intake of Vitamin C at 60 mg per day then we should not see scurvy in this country.
However we still see scurvy in this country.
If you are indulging in a high stress job or if you have a stressful lifestyle, got some kids, running a home, doing a job, then the body is going to be breaking
Vitamin C as you are generating adrenaline.
This is the link between stress and heart attacks, that when you are stressed out the body is making adrenaline and is drawing down the levels of Vitamin C in the body.
So that's going to cause a vulnerability to your cardiovascular system because of the lack of Vitamin C.
The medical profession just treat disease, they don't go back to the primary causes of a lot of things because they can't; they don't understand what chemicals come from exercise, they don't understand what chemicals come out of meditation, they don't understand what chemicals come out of your food.
Where conventional medicine misses the boat in a big way is for long term, hard to deal with, the chronic problems.
And the reason why they miss the boat with the chronic problems is because they do nothing to change the reasons why the patient got the disease in the first place.
Basically they treat symptoms.
And if all you do is treat symptoms you are not going to cure the disease.
What you need to do is change the root cause.
It took me about two years of seeing patients that should already have died with conventional medicine with their prognosis, their ability to survive more than just a few months under traditional clinical conditions was fairly limited and most of the patients who would have followed conventional medicine would have died.
After I had been with the program for a couple of years and I'd see patient after patient so alive and getting better and tumors going away and multiple sclerosis disappearing and arthritis going away and lupus going away and all these really dramatic problems and that's what really made me one hundred percent fully convinced that I was in the right line of work and that this work really had something valuable.
Cardiovascular disease is a disease of civilization it is a lifestyle disease because we are eating too much of the wrong thing and not enough of the right thing.
And your grandmother said it and her grandmother said it and everybody knows it's true but instead...
...it's fast food and meat, and fat, and sugar, and starch, and processed food that has few vitamins and don't take vitamin supplements because they might hurt you!
Of course cardiovascular disease - that's not the risk!
I’ve been saying for at least twenty-five years that cardiovascular disease is reversible.
Conventional medicine has claimed for a longtime that it was not reversible.
To look at the cure I think tells us something of cause.
Dr. Dean Ornish has done a really good job with people who have severe cardiovascular disease and he puts them on a strict diet which is basically a vegetarian diet.
That means a plant based diet, a high fiber diet loaded with vitamins and nutrients and good things that grow on the ground or at least ground that is organically tended.
Ornish also has them do stress reduction and these people are able to arrest or reverse cardiovascular disease in a year or two.
The cause of cardiovascular disease therefore is a failure to take the vitamins and a failure to eat right.
The good news is that even people with advanced cardiovascular disease when they start taking the nutrients and they change their diet they can arrest it or reverse it without surgery.
What amazed me is that we have some very smart people, we have the brightest and the best wandering the corridors of our leading medical institutions with unlimited budgets and they don't seem to want to finger food and also the western lifestyle as being causative.
In fact about half of all deaths are from cardiovascular disease and in half of those deaths, the first symptom is death.
So people can go through their life for decades with no symptoms at all and then drop dead and then of course it's too late.
It’s too late for a drug, it's too late for a bypass, it's too late for the ambulance, it's too late for resuscitation.
If one in every two and a half people, if you can picture such a creature, are perishing from cardiovascular problems that follows that society is doing something fundamentally wrong.
The only way to win is not to play and that requires that they change their life.
Yet what are we doing?
Every year we are doing billions of dollars worth of bypass surgery that can be totally controlled just by changing the way you eat, drink, live.
Did I mention it was safer?
Did I mention it was cheaper?
And it works very well.
Therefore why don't all cardiologists recommend this approach?
Well, in fairness not all of them have studied it.
And in fairness...
...the drug companies have something to say about it!
Did you notice there is no drugs in there at all?
There is just like no drug therapy at all, its just meditation and vegetarian diet.
There is no profit in this!
...Prozac, ADD tablets, coke, smack, now you know I am turning tricks 'cause.
I used to get high for a livin' believing everything that I saw on the TV
I used to get high for a livin' eatin'all the bullshit food that you sold me...
One of the big problems with the drug approach is the issue of side effects; adverse drug reactions just for a start, in the UK the generally accepted figure of the number of people who die each year as a result of adverse drug reactions is about ten thousand.
To put that into some sort of perspective the number of people who die from motorcar accidents is about three and a half thousand.
We are all very worried about motorcar accidents; we don't seem to be so worried about adverse drug reactions.
The number of people who die as a result of prostate cancer which is of enormous concern and we have campaigns and so on is round about nine thousand in this country.
The Journal of the American Medical
Association published papers, which indicated that approximately one hundred and six thousand Americans die from pharmaceutical drugs each year.
Now these are drugs that are properly prescribed, not physician errors and these are side effects that are normally expected.
And these are people who took the medication as directed.
This doesn't count overdoses or misuses.
So if a hundred and six thousand people die from normal expected side effects of drugs just in America just in one year in twenty-three years that's an enormous number of people, were talking millions of people dead from pharmaceutical drugs.
And in twenty-three years - ten allegedly dead from vitamins.
Clearly we have to be a lot more serious about prescribing nutrition.
And as Roger Williams said, the discoverer of panathenic acid, when in doubt use nutrition first.
The pharmaceutical industry is in business not to make drugs.
It’s in business to make money.
Which I think is perfectly reasonable they are large international corporations and they have a duty to their shareholders and that's what corporations do, is they make money.
We live in a capitalist society, and I don't happen to think that is a bad thing.
And I think capitalism has it's great advantages and I think it can be abused roundly and we have seen both sides of it.
The problem lies in the way that they are regulated.
I believe we have some very good regulators but we've got some very incompetent regulators as well.
The bodies which are required to both license drugs and then to see what happens to them afterwards are all paid for by the drug companies.
If you discovered that all the people who were your hygiene inspectors for restaurants were all paid for by the restaurant owners, you might be rather suspicious about their findings.
That's the kind of situation we have with the drugs and that's what needs to change.
They pay the regulators who are supposed to be overseeing the drugs, they pay the academics who are meant to be researching the drugs and very often the trials that they run will be run by people who are part of the drug company.
They also put in adverts into the medical journals most of the medical journals are supported by drug company advertising.
If we check the medical literature for the last sixty-five, seventy-five years there are thousands of papers showing that high doses of nutrients cure disease.
Now some of these papers you don't get to read because they were published in journals that, say, the United States National Library of Medicine refuses to index.
Isn't that interesting?
So there are medical journals out there that are basically blacklisted.
Whatever is published in certain medical journals such as the Journal of Ortho-Molecular
Medicine of which I am assistant editor whatever is being published in our journal for the last forty-one years and that's hundreds of papers, none of that is indexed by the
US National Library of Medicine self proclaimed as the largest medical library on earth.
So that what looks like pure scientific academics researching journals publishing and the whole edifice of science is actually, has been turned by the drug companies into an arm of their marketing department.
But I'd like to know about health information that comes to us from advertising?
That's what we call commercial health information.
It’sa mighty big business.
Millions of dollars are spent to advertise health products and all kinds of pills and other medicines for all kinds of aches and pains.
You see sometimes the advertising can be deceptive.
There are twenty-five percent of the TV ads in this country are drug commercials.
First question, why?
It’s not because they like spending a lot of money.
It's because while they're spending hundreds of millions of dollars on TV time.
They are getting back billions on people buying those things because people are sick.
They are not feeling well.
We need drugs.
There's no question about that at all.
Pain management, brilliant.
And drugs are necessary but there comes this whole point where we live in a society where if a little is good more must be much better.
So we end up with now a drug industry that is trying to find a drug for everything.
You know got a bad attitude - have a drug.
Feeling a little depressed you know - have a drug and the public has come to rely on it, the public has come to accept this whole idea of taking a pill to fix an ill.
What would happen if everybody ate lots and lots of fresh organic food that was minimally processed?
I think we would have an epidemic of health.
I think the stock market would tremble.
The drug industry is a half trillion dollar a year world wide conglomerate.
Almost three hundred billion dollars just in North America.
This is really, really big business.
What would happen if everybody were well?
There is no money in health.
You see good health makes a lot of sense, but it doesn't make a lot of dollars.
I think we can have an ethical drug industry.
I really, really do.
But I think we've really got to start sharpening up the divides between the regulators and the people making the drugs and this is an absolute shambles right now.
The idea that all drugs are firmly based in the evidence and all of the non-drug treatments are just a mixture of hope and delusion and placebo effect and charlatans just doesn't really stand up to examination.
For example, in order for a drug to be licensed it has to show that it is more effective than a placebo in two trials.
This doesn't mean to say that the drug company can't do lots of other trials in which it doesn't prove to be more effective, it just doesn't need to publish those.
What it needs to do is go along to the regulator and say we have these two trials, which show the drug is more effective than a placebo.
Can we have a license to market it please?
Now these are samples taken from manufacturers batches of insulin and antibiotic drugs.
We test them for purity and potency before they are sold.
Of course new drugs are always coming along and we make sure that they have been tested and found to be safe before they are put on the market.
The doctors will tell you that the drugs have been trial led and tested but what you have to realize when you take a new drug is that you are essentially embarking on an uncontrolled experiment.
The drugs will only have been tested, for the purposes of getting their license, on maybe a few hundred, at the most a few thousand people and they are then going to be given to literally millions.
And within those millions of people there is going to be an enormous range of the way that their systems work, the way that they react to the drugs.
And so people are going to have side-effects.
There is also the fact that the problems most people in the west face are not really acute disorders, which medicine is very good at dealing with, but they are chronic disorders.
They are disorders like depression, diabetes, heart, arthritis and so on.
They are things that don't kill you they just make you rather miserable and feel rather terrible and they go on for a long period of time.
And these are the kind of conditions that all of the drugs are targeted at but they're the conditions that the drugs don't treat very well.
Short term some of them are very life saving-you need to have them.
Some of the corticoid steroids some of the other things that everybody says no, no, no.
Short term, life saving - fine.
Antibiotics short term, life saving - no problem.
I abhor having patients on any long term medication and there is almost no medication in the world that you can't get patients off of.
The perfect drug from the point of view of a drug company is one first of all, that doesn't cure people because people need to take the drug for a long period of time in order for it to be profitable.
Secondly, are they the best way to treat everything from the start and the answer would seem very clearly to be not.
And so for a lot of the chronic conditions, it seems to make a lot of sense to start off by doing what you can with non-drug approaches.
Firstly because they are very unlikely to have the same range of side effects and secondly because in a number of cases it looks as though they have better chance of tackling the underlying problem rather than simply dealing with the symptom.
Doctor Abram Hoffer worked with Bill W the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous and Bill W and Abram became good friends.
Bill W suffered from severe depression.
Abram said, "You should take some Niacin".
He suggested 3,000 mg of Niacin a day.
That was the end of Bill W's depression.
Bill W then suggested to people that were alcoholic why don't you try taking Niacin and see if it helps your depression, see if it helps your alcoholism.
And the majority of the people that tried the Niacin had great improvement.
So Bill W, founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), wanted AA to use Niacin and vitamin therapy.
But AA, which had already been infiltrated, I would say, is a good word by the medical profession, rejected that.
So to this day Alcoholics Anonymous focuses on many laudable steps alcoholics can and should do to stop drinking.
But it does not recommend vitamin therapy.
At the time when there was concern, a growing concern about the issue of whether the anti-depressant SSRI drugs were causing suicide and there had been a few campaigners in roundabout 2000 who had been saying there were problems with these drugs and the regulatory authorities and the drug companies had been denying it.
We did a whole study on those school shootings over in America.
And we studied a number of these incidents and in most cases, in most cases... the shooter is either on or withdrawing from these types of psychiatric medications at the time that they commit these of fences.
And yet none of this stuff really comes out in the trials at all.
And an American researcher came up with the fact that Prozac, which was of course the brand leader at the time, was about to come off patent and so they wondered whether there was a new drug coming up.
And they did some research and they found indeed there was, there was a thing called Prozac R and there had been some tinkering with the molecular structure of it.
In order to produce a new drug you have to say what the improvements are going to be and in the patent application for Prozac R it said will not cause the suicidal thoughts and feelings, which are associated with the existing drug.
Precisely the thing the drug company had been denying was going on for the past 10 years.
I worked with a lady once who was suicidally depressed.
She lived at home with her family.
She was in her 50's and she spent all day sitting in a corner, face to the corner.
She wouldn't talk to anyone.
She wouldn't eat with anyone.
She was totally uncommunicative.
She was under the care of a psychiatrist, of course, as she should be and the psychiatrist had her on a variety of medications, which you would expect.
The family was wondering about nutrition and I mentioned to them about
Dr Hoffers work with Niacin and they wondered how much she needed to take, this person was very seriously ill.
And I mentioned that Dr Hoffer normally gave about 3,000 mg a day of Niacin but some people need a lot more especially very sick people and they should give her as much as it takes to make her better.
Well they figured they could do that.
So at 11,500 mg of Niacin a day she was sitting at the table and talking to them like nothing had happened.
So they went to the psychiatrist, showed the psychiatrist this recovered person and the psychiatrist said,
"Well I don't think you should take all that Niacin it might be harmful."
So they stopped giving her the Niacin and she was back in the corner.
Safety with Niacin? There's not one death from Niacin per year on average,
There have been one or two attributed over the last 15 or 20 years.
But there is not even one death per year from Niacin.
And how many people that are suicidally depressed actually go and end their lives.
Two handfuls of cashews give you the therapeutic equivalent of a prescription dose of Prozac.
Now everyone then says,
"Oh but two handfuls of cashews, isn't that fattening?"
And my point is - do you care?
Do you want to get over the depression?
Were having a difficult time accepting a simple therapy.
Here is what you can do.
If someone is depressed the first thing they can do is know that it's okay to be depressed.
If you are malnourished you should be depressed!
So don't do that anymore go and eat good food.
What's going on in the mind, in the brain.
-Whatever the mind is - can be influenced by the nutrients, the chemicals going into it and what is happening as well.
This is not to say that psychological treatments aren't important, they are but you can't get anywhere with a patient who's got psychological and psychiatric symptomatology if their brain is hungry, if it's starved, or if it's poisoned.
There is a fact of life in medicine that if I take your bone and measure it you've got 5,000 times more lead in it than you would've been if you'd been an Egyptian pharaoh.
If I take some fat samples you've still got DDT, DDE and DDD in your fat samples even though DDT has been banned a long time ago.
As well as a whole range of other chemicals.
But does anybody want to hear about that? No.
And that has not yet registered or if it has doctors simply refuse to do it because everything they do is toxic, every drug they use,
Prescription drugs, over the counter drugs all drugs are liver toxic bar none.
Something like 79 million Americans are getting mercury fillings put in their mouths everyday right now.
Legally we are not supposed to say they are toxic so I never mention that to patients.
But for a documentary, are they?
You betcha.
If I look at your brain and do a brain biopsy
I'll find a large amount of Mercury in your system if you've had amalgam fillings put in your mouth.
What makes amalgam and mercury so much safer when you put it into a tooth compared to when it's sitting on a dentist's tray?
It’s highly toxic and the dentist has to handle it as one of the most toxic substances known to man but it's made safe when put into your tooth. Which is nonsense.
Suffice it to say if you have it in your mouth you are being poisoned by it.
End of story.
These toxins when you stop pushing them into the system start to come out.
And actually if you now only change your diet to the point of eating all organic you are releasing all these poisons, they go into the bloodstream and into the liver and unless you help the liver get rid of it you can cause new damage.
It’sa mistake, it's half a therapy, the other half of the therapy is detoxify.
Colonics, enemas, things that help to move stuff out.
Herbs that help to move things out.
Water that helps to move things out.
These are critical factors in the cleansing equation because our body's primary method of cleansing and detoxification is through the bowels.
We have to get the toxins out to even allow the nutrients to get into the tissues.
You can't get them in there if they are full of poisons.
You can't get two things into one space.
The basic idea is, is you've got to start by doing the simplest thing ever which is upon rising drink lots of water.
As simple as that is it's amazing how few people actually do that.
Drink a litre, two litres of water before you have any food, before you have any coffee, whatever tea, whatever you start your morning with.
Drink, just straight water and then begin your day.
What we notice first is initially - boom, things flow out.
My cousin lost 150 pounds in about an 18-month period on our program...
Raw organic natural foods across the selection we have been talking about.
And he actually moved all that toxicity out of his body through his bowels.
Twelve bowel movements a day.
One day he lost 15 pounds in one day.
That is really interesting but really difficult to talk about to the general public because when we think of weight loss we think were going to go work out and convert it into muscle and sweat it off but actually in this day and age with the toxicity that's in the average fat cell of the average person you don't want to move that stuff out through your skin.
You want to get it out through your bowels as quickly as possible.
The big problem with cancer research is that the public is lead to believe that the cancer breakthrough is around the next corner.
Look at any newspaper most weeks and there will be a story in there - new cancer cure.
And yet when you stand back and look at what's actually happening your relatives continue to die, my relatives continue to die, the cancer breakthrough turns out to be just another drug that causes cancer because most of these chemos are themselves carcinogens that's the whole point these are cell toxins they're designed to poison tumor cells so they don't replicate.
So the big mistake that is happening here is that the cancer industry is continuing to view the tumor as the cancer and we know the tumor is not the cancer because if the tumor were the cancer that would mean that we could cut the tumors out of the human body and they would never grow back and we know that's not true we know these tumors can and do grow back and the reason they grow back is you have not corrected the underlying metabolic process.
Cancer is one of the most deadly and elusive enemies ever faced by man.
Once cancerous cells appear they soon develop into a clump of tissue that lives at the expense of the entire body.
This tissue crowds and robs nourishment from other cells, tissues or organs.
There's a lot of people that are beginning to realize that conventional medicine just does not work.
The AMA (American Medical
Association) themselves said that for cancer specifically independent of the stage that the patient comes to the doctors office whether it's stage 1 or 4, most cancers are divided into 4 stages-
Independent of the stage that the patient first arrives less than 30% survive 5 years using chemo, surgery or radiation.
That means that more than 70% of them die.
That is just not acceptable.
What chance do I really have doctor?
Marshall...
I have no desire to mislead you.
I am sure you realize that recovery is not a sure thing, but...
...if we can go through surgery as quickly as possible
I believe you have a good chance at recovery.
We have the precedent set by Dr Max
Gerson back in the 1930's and 1940's who showed that vitamins and especially large quantities of fresh vegetable juices and organic foods would help to reverse cancer and Gerson had about a 50% cure rate with terminally ill patients - that's extremely high.
With malignant melanoma, the Gerson Therapy is spectacular.
That in itself is enough reason for every physician to learn about the Gerson Therapy - but they don't.
Medical school does not talk about these alternatives.
Normal human body has powerful defenses to the point where cancer is impossible.
The human body has such powerful defenses that a normal healthy body cannot, will not, develop cancer or any other chronic disease for that matter.
Not only that but with good healthy normal rich organic food you can reverse these diseases, and that's what we do.
So if you want to reverse cancer what you really got to do is get in there and wreck the internal environment that cancer depends on to thrive and that's how these clinics are doing it.
What they are not doing is loading loads of chemotherapy, and radiation and toxicity into the body to create more problems for the immune system, which is already weakened, and vulnerable.
-That's why the person has got cancer.
And as G. Edward Griffin says if you want to give somebody cancer...
...give them chemotherapy.
Because those chemotherapies are themselves carcinogens most of the time.
I receive thousands of phone calls a year and not a few of those are coming from people who went through all the best medicine that hospitals could give them and the tumors kept growing back... and when they said; "Why do I keep getting this cancer back?" doctors said; "We don't know - in fact we don't really know what causes cancer."
I mean we've known for 60 years!
In fact we have known since professor John Beard of Edinburgh University wrote his thesis in 1904, that cancer is a healing process that hasn't switched off.
But you see again it comes back to, it's not that the drug industry is selectively lying to people they're just not covering the issues the way they should be covering it.
A classic example is the way they've manipulated the survival rates.
The word "survive" you know you'll hear an advert which says;
"Well now, give to this charity, we are now seeing that eighty percent of women are surviving breast cancer."
And yet what they have done is they've redefined the word "survive" to mean only five years after initial treatment.
So take my aunt - my aunt got cancer, she is forever immortalized as a cancer survivor
'cause she survived the five years but she died six months later.
So she is cured and dead.
In 1972 our then President Nixon stated that if we throw enough money at this cancer problem we will solve it.
We were able to put a man on the moon and we ought to be able to solve the problem.
Together we can hardly fail for there is no force on Earth to match the will and spirit of the people of America.
And in 1972 he agreed to make a great deal of money available.
That year, 220,000
Americans died of cancer.
Exactly twenty-five years later,
USA Today, the big newspaper,
I think it was also in Newsweek, published the figures of what actually did happen.
What happened was the US government; us taxpayers put out over 39 billion
US dollars for research on cancer.
The result was twenty-five years later in 1996
560,000 people died of cancer, more than double!
The five year or better survival rate for almost all forms of cancer is unchanged for the last four decades.
That's pretty sad.
Cancer remains man's number two killer, second only to heart disease.
Little wonder that a victim of cancer like Mr. Marshall feels depressed.
You see the thing about a war, and this is a cancer war - wars are only profitable when you are fighting them.
Let's face it, if cancer disappeared tomorrow, millions of people would have to retrain.
I mean this is a 200 billion dollar a year industry that you are going to have to dismantle if the truth ever came out about what we would need to do.
A lot of people ask, you know, why I am in Mexico?
That's precisely why.
I am an American citizen, I live in
San Diego, my kids went to school here,
I would love to be able to do what I believe is correct in the country of my birth.
My patients, a lot of them come from the US.
They would like to be able to do what is in their opinion a good program to cure their disease problem in their countries of birth whether that be Australia, whether that be New Zealand, whether that be Canada,
England, the US it doesn't matter.
Unfortunately, we can't until we get the health care laws changed.
The war against cancer has been fought with one arm behind the back and I would never go into the ring with the heavyweight champion of the world and fight with one arm.
And yet by restricting cancer research and cancer treatment to basically drug, surgery, radiation approaches and not considering nutrition seriously we have done a terrible disservice to all these people.
So it's not that people are lying, it's not that everybody who works in the cancer industry is somehow an evil and wicked person.
What we look at here is we are seeing that a lot of people are doing what they believe is best.
You can be sincere and you can be sincerely wrong.
The good news is we change that today.
One of the few free choices a person has is what they will or will not eat.
So we have to make sure that we are looking at doing everything possible to build the body up and not break it down. That makes all the sense in the world, doesn't it?
You should do everything you possibly can and stack the deck in your favour and that means building the immune system nutritionally and using vitamins to help the body fight the disease because being malnourished can't possibly help you beat cancer.
In males the digestive tract is most frequently afflicted with cancer.
Colon cancer is a good place to start because it's not very easy to treat.
Colon cancer is a very serious disease and
I would say its 100% preventable by having a high fiber diet and avoiding things that we know that aggravate cancer such as certain additives, food preservatives, environmental chemicals they could be a cause of any number of cancers.
The Japanese who live in Japan and eat the standard Japanese diet, live the standard Japanese lifestyle, have the lowest incidence of cancer in the world.
And it's believed that the low incidence is due to the high intake of seafood including fish and sea vegetables.
With that diet there is a high intake of trace elements like selenium, zinc and germanium and a whole range of other anti cancer trace elements.
There is also a high intake of the Omega 3 fish oils which are protective as well not only for cancers but heart disease and Alzheimer's.
And they also drink green tea and green tea has got a range of chemicals to protect us against cancer as well protect our cells and our genes and so on.
In the female cancers of the breast and the uterus are the most prevalent.
You take a Japanese woman from Japan where the incidence of breast cancer is very low and transplant her into America and she changes her lifestyle the incidence of cancer then starts creeping up to that of the American woman, which is round about 13% now.
So 13% of females in America are at risk, will get cancer of the breast.
Japanese are less than 1%.
We doctors are improving our techniques.
No individual is alone in the fight against cancer.
Research workers are finding and reporting more and more facts.
We will conquer cancer.
When we look at high doses of
Vitamin C given intravenously as an actual chemotherapeutic agent, we have wonderful uplifting news for every cancer patient in the world.
And it's easy and safe - and did I say inexpensive?
-To have a physician give an IV.
You just have to insist on it.
I believe in the next ten years this will become more accepted but people with cancer can't afford to wait and the ones that are already dead have been grossly mistreated by the medical profession and by the government that is supposedly supposed to encourage free research and development of all possibilities.
So when you come along and say instead of treating cancer with chemotherapy you can give intravenous Vitamin C
30... 60... 100,000 mg a day directly into the blood stream, and that will kill cancer cells.
Vitamin C at that high dose is selectively toxic to cancer cells and that's exactly what chemotherapy is but with Vitamin C there's no damage to healthy cells and people don't get nauseous, they don't lose their hair all they do is get better.
We pushed the dose up to 40,000 mg, 50,000 mg,
60,000 mg, we pushed the dose up to 100,000 mg, we even went to 200,000 mg, we nearly got to a quarter of a kilo, IVin 24 hours.
No adverse events, no adverse side-effects apart from thirst and feeling a little bit woozy in the head.
Now that's with huge amounts of Vitamin C the substances that were meant to cause kidney stones if you took 100 mg.
Now we wonder; why isn't this being done?
Because the next assumption is, if this were so good my doctor would already know about it, if this were so good it would be on television, if this were so good it would be taught in medical school and that's another one of those assumptions.
Why would you want to teach about vitamins in medical school?
Why would medical doctors who studied medicine and practice medicine and are heavily funded by pharmaceutical companies why would they go and look into vitamins?
The pharmaceutical companies are not going to advocate vitamins, that's not going to work.
The government doesn't know anything that it isn't told by the pharmaceutical companies and other lobbies and by medical lobbies.
The people don't know because they had an education that never had the word orthomolecular in it.
Dr Hugh Reardon said that orthomolecular, which is therapeutic nutrition, orthomolecular medicine is not the answer to any question posed in medical school.
So what you're set here with is two divergent views on health care and whenever you have that you have what we are experiencing today, an impossible dichotomy.
When you talk to people about using high dose Vitamin C for cancer and then you tell them that it's been heavily tested, even the National Institutes of Health are showing that this is working.
Dr Reardon's team has been doing this for twenty-five years or more now.
I’ve seen for thirty years that high doses of vitamins greatly improve a cancer patient's quality of life and greatly improve a cancer patient's length of life.
And there's many, many places in the literature where you can look and find support for high dose nutrient therapy to arrest or even reverse cancer.
It’s an impossible question.
Why isn't it being done?
And the answer of course is until enough people complain laughs it won't be done.
But if everyone demands nutritional therapy it will change.
Right now if you want nutritional therapy and you go to your doctor and ask for it its sort of like ordering chow me in in a French restaurant.
It’s not on the menu, and they don't know how to make it, and you're not going to get it.
You have a right to self-care and self help.
We need to again teach the regulators, the politicians, the doctors and get to the universities and the people training in medicine to understand that there are plants with anti-cancer properties, there are plants with anti-nausea and anti-vomiting properties, there are plants that will help with rashes, there are plants that will help with headaches and tiredness that occur as a result of chemotherapy.
Mom listen...
Now I am sure that those government people are experts at their work.
But ever since I have been taking
Mr Kahumana's tea.
I’ve felt simply wonderful!
Why, I never knew that a remedy could be so effective.
Why I haven't been having my usual attacks at all.
Now why is that if it isn't because of Mr Kahumana's tea?
What if they gave everyone in America free health insurance and no one needed it?
There's a lot of debate over how we should finance and change provide health care to everyone in the United States.
Most civilized countries do have a national program of health care guaranteeing health care for pretty much everybody.
The United States is conspicuously absent.
We have 30 maybe 40 million people that are uninsured in the United States.
That's getting some attention as it rightly should.
But is the solution to simply give them access to a system that doesn't work very well?
Or would it be a good idea to teach them how to be healthy?
I think they need education and not medication.
People need to be made aware of the great benefit of improving their health if they've got a cancer or whatever disease they've got.
We are at a stage now where there is a major change in what's happening with medicine, which is that medicine no longer has a lock on all the information, the internet has changed that.
And as more and more and more of our population start taking their health into their own hands.
There's going to be even more and more of a change, it can't go on the way it is.
I mean the system right now is falling apart.
We must make nutrition the primary prevention strategy for the population and we have to be as zealous on nutrition as we are apparently on global warming.
What we need to be able to do is to persuade the public that you are what you eat, food can change your mood, that you are everything you have ever done to yourself and the choices you make directly affect the outcome of your life.
And it might be easy enough to forget that right now when your 21 years old and very, very fit and healthy eating badly but it all looks a lot different when get into your 40's, 50's and 60's and start to go down with a serious degenerative illness.
We've still got a health system which really is a disease care system and dominated by doctors and hospitals, pathologists, and pharmacologists.
And that sort of a system is going to look after itself, it wants more work and is truly not interested in reducing the amount of illness and disease.
The more work they get the more profit there is and so that's part of the medical industry and it does need to be there, it's very, very important.
The medical industry does get a lot of things right.
Infant survivability at birth - brilliant.
A&E (Accident & Emergency) trauma medicine - brilliant.
God forbid you get smashed up on a motorway and they have to put you back together again they're very good at doing that.
Disease - pathetic.
The medical profession has it wrong.
Even the medical schools that offer nutrition do not offer mega dose nutrition.
Even the medical schools that have courses in alternative medicine are not really focusing on it.
I believe they are just giving it a nod.
The answer is for every person to realize that if you want something done right you have to do it yourself.
You have to read. You have to dig.
You have to want to have this information and of course I might add you have to be willing to actually take the vitamins and actually juice the vegetables.
You have to walk the walk.
And anybody who is watching this right now has at some level made a choice that they want to do something that is going to improve their lives, their families lives, their kids lives and the life of the planet itself.
And the life of all the plants and everything.
If that is our choice then our food choices must correlate with that because if you've ever flown in a plane and you look out the window of the plane and you see what's down there you'll see its all farms.
The primary way that we are interacting with our planet is through agriculture and if we change our food choices, we change agriculture and all of a sudden we shift away from for example corn, wheat, soy diets over to super food diets and organic diets and raw food diets and we shift the whole way that we literally interact with the planet.
The number one thing we are doing on this planet is growing things.
In spite of all the chemical controlled giant agricultural businesses were still growing stuff.
We could grow genetically modified corn or we could grow the most extraordinary goji berries in the world.
There's a lot more turning to alternatives because what's being done beforehand doesn't work, it just doesn't work.
When I look cancer rates going up, heart disease going up, stroke going up,
Alzheimer's and senile dementia and cognitive impairment going up...
A change is due. Clearly the old ways aren't working and what we need to do, we need a fresh paradigm and we need to go back to basics.
And basics is all about going back to look at these cultures who don't get these problems.
In the same way if you want to be a millionaire, go talk to a millionaire don't talk to the guy down at the pub still recovering from the last golden opportunity.
Go find these people who are living a hundred years routinely without cancer, heart disease and see if you can figure out how they are doing it and we've done that work, we have done that science its been done over the last hundred years and its been completely ignored.
The very first course I ever taught was in 1976 and it was called forgotten research in medicine and I am doing the same thing to this day.
I feel very strongly that the best doctor in the world, the best nutritionist in the world is you.
You actually have everything inside of you, all of the equipment necessary to feel if something is right for you or not.
The good news is that people are not a bunch of dummies.
Abraham Lincoln expressed that when he said,
"You can fool some of the people all the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time."
And that's why over half of the population now takes vitamins even though most doctors would say that its really not necessary.
We have a public that's catching on quicker than the medical professions.
In a way it's sad but in a way it's great.
People should stop being patients and start being people.
Why not be healthy and happy? Why not?
You change your life, you do some exercise, you eat right, you feel better, alright that's good, you look better, alright that's good, you live longer, that's good, you save money, that's good and you have the enormous satisfaction of having done it yourself.
People think; "I don't have a medical education, I can't know this."
Oh please! How complicated is it to eat right and drink vegetable juice sand exercise?
You don't need any degree to know that.
It’s too simple to work.
It’s cheap, it's simple, it's safe, it's effective.
The biggest single reason why people aren't doing this is that it requires taking responsibility and that is the only way out.
When we choose raw, organic plant based foods we take our power back and we decide that we are going to have quality and that we are not going to suffer from some 50 ingredients that are in there of chemicals we've never even heard of before.
I am not a big advocate of preaching vegetarianism to everybody or veganism or even rawfoodism.
But we do know for a fact that an 80% raw, organic plant based diet that covers all the different facets of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, seaweeds, sprouts, grasses, super foods and herbs is a massively valuable part of a healthy and wonderfully abundant lifestyle.
There is no magic bullet; there is no mono therapy that cures cancer, that cures heart disease.
But there is a lifestyle change that prevents, arrests, and reverses serious chronic disease.
The solutions are here; they've always been here.
The only thing that's left is just the education, because I am convinced that once people know what the solution is they'll act on it.
They will decide - yep, were doing it.
