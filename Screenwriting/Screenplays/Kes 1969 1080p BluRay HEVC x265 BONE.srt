1
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,955
Jud?

2
00:01:00,048 --> 00:01:02,374
What?

3
00:01:02,468 --> 00:01:04,795
Yer'd better get up.

4
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,142
The alarm's gone off, yer know.

5
00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:17,729
Do you think I don't know?

6
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:22,819
- Jud?
- What?

7
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:26,335
- You'll be late.
- Shut it.

8
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:30,664
- Clock's not fast, yer know.
- I said, shut it.

9
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,595
- Give over. That hurts!
- Well, shut it, then.

10
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:35,880
I'll tell me mam on you.

11
00:01:35,974 --> 00:01:38,466
Shut yer stinkin' mouth.

12
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:47,479
Oh, Christ!

13
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,321
- Set clock on for me, Jud. For seven.
- Set it yerself.

14
00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:55,490
Go on, you're up.

15
00:01:58,088 --> 00:02:00,581
Hands off cocks; on socks.

16
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:06,631
You rotten sod!
Just because you've to get up!

17
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:10,053
- Another few weeks, you'll be up with me.
- I'll not.

18
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:13,641
- Won't yer?
- No, cos I'm not gonna work down the pit.

19
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:16,937
- Where are yer gonna work?
- I don't know, but not down the pit.

20
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:19,107
No. And have I to tell yer why?

21
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:23,405
For one thing, you've to be able
to read and write before they set yer on.

22
00:02:23,499 --> 00:02:26,336
And they wouldn't have
a weedy little twat like thee.

23
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:30,039
- Switch t'light out, then.
- Switch it out yerself.

24
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:00,833
Me billicking bike!

25
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:41,767
- I thought you weren't coming.
- Why? I'm not late, am I?

26
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,187
Very near.

27
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:47,817
- I nearly was, though.
- What do yer mean?

28
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:50,071
Our Jud, he's taken t'bike.

29
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:52,240
- What you gonna do, then?
- Walk it.

30
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:55,954
- How long d'yer think that's gonna take?
- It'll not take me long.

31
00:05:56,047 --> 00:06:00,752
There's a waiting list a mile long
for that job. Good lads, too, most of 'em.

32
00:06:00,846 --> 00:06:04,893
- From up Firs Hill, round there.
- I haven't let you down, have I?

33
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:07,720
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'. Not very promisin'.

34
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:10,683
- A bit on the nippy side as well, I think.
- Aye.

35
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:13,530
- 20 Players tipped, please.
- Oh, right.

36
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:17,943
- I've not got 20. Will two tens do?
- Yes. That'll be quite all right, thank you.

37
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:21,573
Thank you. Right. Cheerio.

38
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,035
- Cheerio. Good mornin', sir.
- Good mornin'.

39
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:26,372
You know what they said
when I took you on?

40
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:31,806
"You'll have to keep yer eyes open now.
He'll take yer breath if you're not careful."

41
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:36,552
- I haven't taken owt of yours yet, have I?
- I haven't given you a chance, that's why.

42
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,682
You don't have to.
I haven't been nicking for ages now.

43
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:42,895
- Ah, well, don't stand about all day.
- I'm goin'.

44
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:01,047
- How tha goin' on?
- Not so bad.

45
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:03,299
Get one of these. Better than walkin'.

46
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:06,064
Only just. I could go
faster on a kid's scooter.

47
00:08:06,147 --> 00:08:10,935
Tha knows what I always say; third-class
ridin's better than first-class walkin'.

48
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,314
Third-class ridin'? In that ramshack?

49
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:18,070
Ramshack? This is one of best models
t'dairy's got. Cheeky! Sithee tomorrow.

50
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:22,577
- Can only go 20 mile an hour, as it is.
- Tha's got too much rattle, thee.

51
00:08:56,886 --> 00:09:00,630
"Desperate Dan is stronger than all,
but this opponent makes him fall."

52
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:04,009
"- Right! Where do you want to fight?
- Right here!"

53
00:09:04,103 --> 00:09:04,845
"SKlD."

54
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:07,473
"Down I go again!
What's making me fall?"

55
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:10,060
"Now's my chance to -
jump on his chest!"

56
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:11,061
"THUD."

57
00:09:11,155 --> 00:09:13,357
"You won't catch me out this time,
you braggart!"

58
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,693
"A sock in the midriff
will settle your game!"

59
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:16,862
"SPLASH."

60
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:19,323
"What's this on my face?
Why, it's grease!"

61
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:22,703
"- Give me that tube back!
- That's how he kept making me slip!"

62
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,551
"He was squirting
invisible grease under my feet!"

63
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:28,670
"You dirty twister!
It's time somebody taught you a lesson!"

64
00:09:28,764 --> 00:09:31,214
"- Take that!
- CRASH!"

65
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:34,636
"- Where did he end up?
- In the middle of next week, Uncle Dan!"

66
00:09:52,422 --> 00:09:55,123
- Evenin'.
- I told yer it wouldn't take me long.

67
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:57,585
What did you do?
Throw 'em over the gates?

68
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:03,134
- I know some short cuts ont' way back.
- I'll bet you do! Over other folk's property.

69
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:08,726
How many times d'yer want
tellin' where to put that bag?

70
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:15,401
- Time is it?
- Time you were at school.

71
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:16,769
ls it that late?

72
00:10:16,873 --> 00:10:20,493
I wouldn't be your teacher
for all the coal in Barnsley.

73
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:25,885
Oh, Mr Porter! Watch it, Mr Porter.

74
00:10:25,969 --> 00:10:29,338
Yer clumsy young bugger!
What yer tryin' to do? Kill me?

75
00:10:29,432 --> 00:10:31,507
I lost me balance.

76
00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:36,640
I wouldn't put it past yer, either.
I fair felt me heart go then.

77
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:39,852
Just sit down here and
relax a couple o' minutes.

78
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:42,815
Are yer all right now?

79
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:46,028
- I'm bloody champion!
- I'll be off, then.

80
00:10:46,748 --> 00:10:49,241
And don't be late tonight.

81
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:53,883
- Allot?
- Sir.

82
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:55,426
- Bowser?
- Sir.

83
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,002
Bridges?

84
00:10:57,096 --> 00:11:00,257
- Absent, sir.
- Absent, Bridges. Casper?

85
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:01,894
- Sir.
- Clegg?

86
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:03,678
- Sir.
- Fisher?

87
00:11:03,772 --> 00:11:06,056
German Bight.

88
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:11,397
- Did you say something?
- I didn't mean to, sir.

89
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:14,777
Stand up, lad. What did you say?

90
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:18,657
- German Bight, sir.
- He's daft, sir.

91
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:21,620
- ls this your ridiculous idea of a joke?
- No, sir.

92
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:25,125
- What is the idea, then?
- When you said "Fisher", sir.

93
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:27,754
- What about it?
- Fisher. German Bight.

94
00:11:27,848 --> 00:11:31,791
It's the shipping forecast, sir.
Fisher. German Bight. Cromarty.

95
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:34,847
I like to hear it every night, sir.
I like t'names.

96
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,854
So you thought you'd enlighten me and
the class with your idiotic information?

97
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:42,785
- No, sir.
- Making a mess of my register.

98
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,539
- lt just came out.
- And so did you, Casper.

99
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,189
Just come out from under a stone.

100
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:55,376
I said, quiet!

101
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,880
ls anyone else absent
besides Bridges and Fisher?

102
00:11:58,974 --> 00:12:01,509
Any girls?

103
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:04,764
Right. Now, then,
it's time you were off to assembly.

104
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,529
One row at a time. This one, stand.

105
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:12,108
Move forward.

106
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,606
Pamela, you're talking. Cut it out.

107
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:27,306
- Billy, what do yer mean, Germans bite?
- I'm sick of hearin' about "Germans bite"!

108
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,757
- Are yer comin' nestin' tomorrow?
- Ar.

109
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:31,802
- What time?
- About six.

110
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:33,721
Don't be late.

111
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:35,432
- Coming, Guth?
- Where?

112
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:37,518
- Nestin'.
- When?

113
00:12:37,612 --> 00:12:39,020
- Tomorrow.
- What time?

114
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:43,026
- About six.
- Can't. Takin' t'girlfriend to Sheffield.

115
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,779
Excuses!

116
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:05,516
What do you want
at this time in the morning?

117
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,935
Get your Mac up.

118
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:10,356
Hey, he's fast asleep.
I can't get him up at this time.

119
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,444
- Just get him up for me.
- His father, he'll be down to yer.

120
00:13:13,538 --> 00:13:17,157
I'm not bothered about his father.
I want your MacDowall.

121
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,641
- Bugger off, you little sod!
- Get him up, will yer?

122
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:30,885
- I'm not gettin' him up.
- He said I had to get him up.

123
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:34,598
He's fast asleep and he's not goin',
so just get off with yer.

124
00:17:15,545 --> 00:17:18,622
- Now, then. What's tha doin'?
- Nowt.

125
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:21,083
Bugger off, then. It's private property.

126
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:24,171
- Can I get up to that kestrel's nest?
- What kestrel's nest?

127
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:27,050
- Up wall.
- No nest up there, so off tha goes.

128
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:29,638
There is. I've seen 'em come out.

129
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,521
What will tha do? Take all its eggs?

130
00:17:35,614 --> 00:17:38,900
- They're young 'uns.
- Nowt to go up for, then, is there?

131
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:42,739
Can I come to t'bottom, then?
Never seen a kestrel's nest before.

132
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,908
Come on, then.

133
00:17:51,762 --> 00:17:53,963
There it is. That big hole.

134
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:57,469
- It's nested there for donkey's years now.
- And I never knew.

135
00:17:57,562 --> 00:18:01,975
- No, there's not many that does.
- Been watchin' from t'wood there.

136
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:04,738
Goes onto t'post, then hovers,

137
00:18:04,823 --> 00:18:09,777
then swoops down onto t'prey,
carries it off to t'young 'uns. Looks great.

138
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:12,239
I've been gonna knock
that wall down for ages.

139
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:16,036
- What for?
- It's dangerous. I won't let her play near.

140
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:19,374
- lf I lived round here, l'd train a young 'un.
- Would yer?

141
00:18:19,468 --> 00:18:21,669
Yer can train 'em.

142
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:23,838
Do yer know how?

143
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:28,261
- Do you know?
- No. There's not many that does.

144
00:18:28,355 --> 00:18:31,766
They're hard to train.
lf they're not kept properly, it's criminal.

145
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,645
- Do yer know anybody who's kept 'em?
- One or two.

146
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:39,193
But, er, they had to let 'em go
because they're hard to train.

147
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:42,365
Where can I find out about 'em, then?

148
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:46,871
Well, probably t'public library.
They'll have some books on 'em.

149
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:48,749
- Where's that?
- Down int' city.

150
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:51,419
Hey, are you a member?

151
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:54,079
- What do yer mean?
- Are you a member of the library?

152
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:57,052
I don't know about that.
I only want a book on falconry.

153
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:59,764
You have to be a member
to take a book out.

154
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:03,477
- I only want one.
- Have you filled one of these forms in?

155
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:09,945
- No.
- You're not a member, then.

156
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:13,158
You'll have to take one of these home
for your father to sign.

157
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,788
- Me dad's away.
- You can wait till he comes back home.

158
00:19:16,882 --> 00:19:21,503
- I don't mean that. I mean he's left home.
- I see. Your mother'll have to sign it.

159
00:19:21,597 --> 00:19:25,008
Ar, but she's at work
and she'll not be home till tea time.

160
00:19:25,102 --> 00:19:27,011
There's no rush, is there?

161
00:19:27,104 --> 00:19:29,598
I've never broke a book.
I haven't tore it, or...

162
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:33,562
Look at your hands. They're filthy.
We'll end up with dirty books that way.

163
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:38,527
- I don't ready dirty books.
- I hope you don't. You're not old enough.

164
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:42,324
Me mam knows someone who
works here. That'll help, won't it?

165
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:45,495
No, not at all.
You still have to have the back signed.

166
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:48,792
To be a member, you'll have
to have somebody over 21

167
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:51,639
who is on the borough
electoral roll to sign it.

168
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:54,216
- I'm over 21 .
- You're not over 21 .

169
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,220
- Ar, but I vote.
- You don't vote. You're not...

170
00:19:57,314 --> 00:20:00,068
I vote for me mam.
She dun't like votin', so I do it.

171
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,981
- Just have to wait for it, won't you?
- Where would I find a book? In a shop?

172
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:08,862
You'd have to go down the street.
There's a second-hand bookshop there.

173
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:39,989
- Hello. Can I help you?
- Yes.

174
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:46,164
I'm rather interested in Noël Coward's
autobiography, Present lndicative.

175
00:21:26,481 --> 00:21:29,683
- What's tha got this for? Tha can't read.
- Give us it here.

176
00:21:29,777 --> 00:21:32,938
Get off! Falconry?
What's tha want to know about falconry?

177
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:35,024
Give it here!

178
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:37,444
- Where've yer got this from?
- I've lent it.

179
00:21:37,538 --> 00:21:40,407
Stole it, more like.
Where've yer got it from?

180
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:42,576
A shop in town.

181
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,544
You must be crackers. I could understand
if it were money, but chuff me, not a book!

182
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:52,924
Have it!

183
00:21:53,018 --> 00:21:55,720
Look what yer've done.
I'm lookin' after this book.

184
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:59,945
- And what better off will yer be?
- A lot. I'm gonna get a kestrel and train it.

185
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,594
Train it? Yer couldn't train a flea.

186
00:22:03,658 --> 00:22:05,942
Anyway, where yer gonna get
a kestrel from?

187
00:22:06,036 --> 00:22:07,946
- I know a nest.
- Yer don't.

188
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,157
- All right, then, I don't.
- Where?

189
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,160
- I'm not tellin'.
- I said, where?

190
00:22:12,254 --> 00:22:15,248
- You're hurtin' me arm!
- Where, then?

191
00:22:15,342 --> 00:22:17,417
Monastery Farm.

192
00:22:19,848 --> 00:22:22,132
Yer could have broke me arm then.

193
00:22:22,226 --> 00:22:25,063
I'll have to see about
goin' round there wi' me gun.

194
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:28,433
- I'll tell t'farmer on yer.
- Why? What's he got to do with it?

195
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:31,093
- He protects 'em.
- Protects 'em?

196
00:22:31,197 --> 00:22:34,607
Hawks are a menace to farmers.
They eat all the poultry an' that.

197
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:37,987
Ar, I know. They dive down
onto t'cows and take 'em away.

198
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:42,535
- Funny bugger.
- Well, yer talk daft. They're only small.

199
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:45,999
They eat mice, insects,
and little birds sometimes.

200
00:22:46,426 --> 00:22:51,632
Hope I'll be watchin' a bird tonight. She'll
not have feathers. Not all over, anyway.

201
00:22:59,821 --> 00:23:02,689
- Have you had any tea yet, Billy?
- No.

202
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:05,902
Well, get some, then.
You where t'pantry is.

203
00:23:07,164 --> 00:23:10,491
- How's yer horses gone on, Jud?
- Not bad. Two winners.

204
00:23:10,585 --> 00:23:13,371
You haven't.
Might be gettin' tret tonight, then.

205
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:16,750
- Oh, somebody treats you every night.
- Shut it!

206
00:23:16,844 --> 00:23:19,838
And don't you be comin' home
blind drunk again, Jud.

207
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:23,594
- Why? Are yer entertainin'?
- You're kiddin'.

208
00:23:23,688 --> 00:23:27,182
lf I entertained as much as you,
I shall do all right, shan't I?

209
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:30,896
What tripe you've been
goin' out with lately. My God!

210
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:37,237
- Better'n that cripple you bring home.
- What cripple? Reg? He's not a cripple.

211
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:42,244
Will be if he comes in here tonight. At
least them I go out with are not tightfisted.

212
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:47,252
Who is? You chuck your bloody money
around like a Scotchman with no arms!

213
00:23:47,346 --> 00:23:50,757
Have to use a spanner to get
a threepenny bit out of his hand.

214
00:23:50,851 --> 00:23:52,843
Aye, because he's comin' wise to you.

215
00:23:52,937 --> 00:23:57,516
Listen, what about him you're goin' wi'?
Tight as a camel's arse in a sandstorm.

216
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:01,521
Keep yer hand over yer mouth talkin'
about him, cos yer'll get into trouble.

217
00:24:01,615 --> 00:24:04,182
- You're not too big for a hidin'.
- He can't do it.

218
00:24:04,286 --> 00:24:07,989
Who can't? You might find that
he's bigger than what you think.

219
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,200
More chance of gettin' struck by lightnin'.

220
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:15,041
Shut yer face. I'm fed up of it. It's every
Saturday night. I get ready, you're at me.

221
00:24:15,135 --> 00:24:18,296
And I always go out in
a bloomin' mess and all upset.

222
00:24:18,932 --> 00:24:22,008
Gettin' too big for yer boots,
thinking you own t'house.

223
00:24:22,102 --> 00:24:24,262
You don't own it yet, yer know.

224
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:27,934
- No. I will do one day, though, won't I?
- Over my dead body.

225
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:32,524
- That's what I says, I'll own it one day.
- I'm sick on it, Jud. I am, pig sick.

226
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:36,560
I work every day, and every Saturday
night I go for a drink and you upset me.

227
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:39,867
- I don't think I'll go, I'm that fed up.
- I'll not miss yer.

228
00:24:39,961 --> 00:24:42,580
You'll not miss nowt, will you?
You'll be out there.

229
00:24:42,674 --> 00:24:44,749
- Yeah.
- Aye.

230
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:53,626
By, what a smart-lookin' kid int' mirror.
Some bird's gonna be lucky tonight.

231
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,641
Listen to God's gift to woman.

232
00:24:56,735 --> 00:24:59,103
Fancy buying me
a brandy and pep tonight?

233
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,689
Aye. Hope it keeps fine for yer.

234
00:25:08,293 --> 00:25:12,236
These could have done
with a bit of a polish.

235
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,011
Still, never mind, it's gonna be dark soon.

236
00:25:16,137 --> 00:25:18,922
What you gonna do
with yerself tonight, love?

237
00:25:19,016 --> 00:25:21,133
Read me book.

238
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:24,722
Oh, look at t'time. Five to seven.
I'm gonna be late again.

239
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:27,768
Listen, Billy, there's two bob here. Chuck?

240
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:30,856
Get yerself some pop
and some crisps. D'yer hear?

241
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,817
Yeah.

242
00:25:35,623 --> 00:25:38,533
- And don't still be up when I come in.
- No.

243
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,746
G'night, then.

244
00:25:53,272 --> 00:25:55,557
I came home unexpectedly

245
00:25:55,651 --> 00:25:58,645
And caught her crying needlessly

246
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:01,064
In the middle of the day

247
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:07,491
And it was in the early spring
when flowers bloom and robins sing

248
00:26:07,584 --> 00:26:09,661
She went away

249
00:26:11,298 --> 00:26:14,584
And honey, I miss you

250
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:19,299
And I'm bein' good

251
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:24,055
And l'd love to be with you

252
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:30,565
lf only I could

253
00:26:35,624 --> 00:26:37,492
Folks, thank you.

254
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:41,414
Now a Tremeloes number.

255
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:44,000
Yer can have a good time up to a point,

256
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:46,931
but there comes a time
when you want to settle down.

257
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:49,884
I'm gettin' a bit fed up
of workin' all t'time.

258
00:26:49,978 --> 00:26:53,556
There's plenty of time
to settle down, in't there?

259
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,351
Depends what yer lookin' for, dun't it?

260
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:03,110
I just like to come home, get me meal,
get a bath, change and out, me.

261
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,278
Not a care int' world.

262
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,283
When you've been married once
and yer marry a wrong 'un,

263
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:10,913
it makes yer a bit apprehensive
towards gettin'...

264
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:14,210
Well, you know, don't yer?
Cos he were never good.

265
00:27:14,303 --> 00:27:18,007
But it makes yer a bit more wary
about gettin' married again.

266
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,095
lf she wants to go with a different bloke,
it's not up to me.

267
00:27:21,188 --> 00:27:23,723
She's old enough to know her own mind.

268
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:25,768
- Well, yeah...
- ..settle down.

269
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:30,076
You can never tell with Billy. I sit
and wonder sometimes what he will do.

270
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,290
Perhaps if he had been brought up
in a different environment

271
00:27:34,373 --> 00:27:37,993
and had a better education, he would
have made more than what he has.

272
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:41,999
At the moment, he's hopeless.
He's a hopeless case, in't he?

273
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,418
Oh, won't you please come back?

274
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:47,965
Oh, won't you please come back?

275
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:56,978
I'm happy as I am.
I doubt if I could be any happier.

276
00:27:57,072 --> 00:28:00,607
My lads have got nowt.
I don't know what they're gonna do.

277
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:03,487
I don't know whether
our Jud wanted to be a miner.

278
00:28:07,795 --> 00:28:11,873
From my point of view, Reg, when
a woman gets to my age, you've two kids,

279
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:15,337
you want to be settlin' down
wi' a nice house

280
00:28:15,431 --> 00:28:21,221
and somebody to come home to yer,
and be lookin' after 'em.

281
00:28:21,314 --> 00:28:25,226
- Like I look after you.
- Ar, but you're not married to me.

282
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,564
- Never mind. Giz a kiss.
- Don't be so damned daft!

283
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:31,224
- He's had too much ale again.
- I haven't.

284
00:28:31,328 --> 00:28:32,789
- Yer have.
- I haven't.

285
00:28:32,872 --> 00:28:35,740
Say, Mam, have you brought
that cripple wi' yer?

286
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:38,870
Keep it shut. Keep it shut.

287
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:40,665
Keep it shut, all right?

288
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,336
Say, did everybody hear
about him when he got married?

289
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,374
He got confetti on elastic.
That's how tightfisted he is.

290
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:52,390
lf he wants trouble, I'll give him trouble.

291
00:28:52,483 --> 00:28:56,353
Oh, along the road there lives
a guy l'd like you all to know

292
00:28:57,532 --> 00:29:00,901
He grew a great big marrow
for the little flower show

293
00:29:01,496 --> 00:29:05,116
He showed it to a lady
who lived just along the way

294
00:29:05,752 --> 00:29:10,957
And when she saw the size of it
he heard the lady say

295
00:29:14,806 --> 00:29:16,674
Ooohhh!

296
00:29:17,977 --> 00:29:19,927
What a beauty!

297
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:23,391
Oh, I've never seen one
as big as that before

298
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:25,905
Ooohhh!

299
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:27,855
What a whopper!

300
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:30,443
lt must be 18 inches long or more

301
00:29:31,788 --> 00:29:35,324
It's such a lovely colour,
it's nice and round and fat

302
00:29:35,585 --> 00:29:38,913
Whoever thought a marrow
could grow as big as that?

303
00:29:39,716 --> 00:29:41,792
Ooohhh!

304
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:45,172
Oh, what a beauty

305
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:48,103
I've never seen one as big as it before

306
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,817
Billy, are tha asleep?

307
00:30:55,447 --> 00:30:57,732
Bleedin' things.

308
00:31:01,957 --> 00:31:04,325
Now, Billy!

309
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:06,577
- Give over.
- Billy!

310
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:09,342
Help me get these bleedin' trousers off.

311
00:31:14,516 --> 00:31:17,082
Come on! Don't be all bleedin' night.

312
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:24,228
I'm fed up with this bloody game.

313
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:29,026
It's every Saturday night alike.

314
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,823
Don't help, will tha?

315
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,893
Get back to sleep, yer... pig.

316
00:31:53,571 --> 00:31:55,564
Hog. Sow.

317
00:31:55,658 --> 00:31:58,067
Yer drunken bastard.

318
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,030
Tha dun't like bein' called a bastard,
does tha? Yer bastard!

319
00:32:02,124 --> 00:32:04,201
Yer pig.

320
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,080
Pig.

321
00:32:07,174 --> 00:32:08,498
Hog.

322
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:09,833
Sow.

323
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:12,420
Drunken... bastard.

324
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,050
Bastard. Bastard.

325
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:16,760
Drunken... pig.

326
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:19,681
Pig.

327
00:32:23,864 --> 00:32:26,273
Billy! Billy!

328
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:16,804
"Three good meals a day
I'll give him for about a fortnight."

329
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:20,601
"lf a piece of meat held between
the finger and thumb of the gloved hand

330
00:35:20,695 --> 00:35:26,151
is offered to the hawk, it will probably
bend down and pull at it with its beak."

331
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:56,861
C'mon.

332
00:36:20,029 --> 00:36:23,190
"As soon as the hawk
will come a leash length indoors,

333
00:36:23,283 --> 00:36:27,227
she may be tried off a fence
or gatepost out of doors."

334
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:32,327
"lt is quite likely that although she was
coming to the fist promptly indoors,

335
00:36:32,421 --> 00:36:34,664
she will now refuse to come at all."

336
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:39,963
"She will stand looking around her and
ignoring the meat and fist in front of her."

337
00:37:03,006 --> 00:37:05,124
"When she will come
a leash length outside,

338
00:37:05,218 --> 00:37:09,672
she can be called greater distances
by means of a creance,

339
00:37:09,766 --> 00:37:13,219
a long cord which is attached
to the hawk to prevent her escaping."

340
00:37:13,313 --> 00:37:16,431
"With luck,
she will not attempt to fly away."

341
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:36,835
Come on, then.

342
00:37:41,477 --> 00:37:44,230
Kes! Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

343
00:37:44,314 --> 00:37:46,473
Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck. Come on, lass.

344
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,852
Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

345
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:53,160
Come on, Kes! Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

346
00:37:53,494 --> 00:37:56,613
Come on, Kes! Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

347
00:37:57,792 --> 00:38:00,357
Come on, then. Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

348
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:04,206
Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck. Come on, Kes.

349
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:18,435
(theme from "Grandstand")

350
00:38:46,443 --> 00:38:49,771
Come on, boys, get ready!

351
00:38:49,865 --> 00:38:51,940
Get ready now, you.

352
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:55,153
Skiving again, Guthrie.

353
00:38:55,247 --> 00:38:58,032
No, sir. Mr Farthing
has been talking to me.

354
00:38:58,126 --> 00:39:01,287
I'll bet that was stimulating
for him, wasn't it, lad?

355
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:05,209
- What does that mean, sir?
- The conversation. What do you think?

356
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:07,253
Does it mean "stimulate", sir?

357
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:12,887
Stimulating, you fool!
S-t-i-m-i-l-a-t-i-n-g. Stimulating.

358
00:39:14,858 --> 00:39:17,696
Come on, get ready.
You're two weeks late already.

359
00:39:20,617 --> 00:39:24,236
You three, get down,
before I come and put yer down.

360
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:31,047
Casper, what d'you think you're doing?
Get down. Why aren't you changed?

361
00:39:31,131 --> 00:39:35,293
- I've no kit, sir.
- Casper, you make me sick.

362
00:39:35,387 --> 00:39:39,330
Every lesson it's the same old story,
"Please, sir, I've no kit, sir."

363
00:39:39,434 --> 00:39:45,683
Every lesson for four years, you've
begged, borrowed, skived and scrounged.

364
00:39:45,777 --> 00:39:49,313
Why is it, Casper, when all this lot
can provide kit, you can't?

365
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:52,401
Don't know. Me mam says
it's a waste of money now I'm leavin'.

366
00:39:52,495 --> 00:39:55,279
You haven't been leaving
the past four years, have you?

367
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:56,573
No, sir.

368
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:59,618
- Use your spending money.
- Don't like football, sir.

369
00:39:59,713 --> 00:40:03,040
- What's that got to do with it, Casper?
- Don't know.

370
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:06,962
- Anyway, I don't get enough.
- Get a job, then, lad. Get a job.

371
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:09,758
- I've got one, sir.
- They pay you, don't they?

372
00:40:09,852 --> 00:40:13,347
Yeah, but I have to give it to me mam.
I'm payin' me fines, like...

373
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:17,384
You should keep out of trouble, lad!
Keep out of trouble.

374
00:40:17,488 --> 00:40:22,150
- I haven't bin in trouble since last time.
- I'll get you some kit, Casper.

375
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:25,791
- Tha's had it now, Casper.
- Shut thi mouth!

376
00:40:27,043 --> 00:40:29,536
Right, Casper. Get into those.

377
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:35,681
- They'll not fit me.
- You can get into them, can't you?

378
00:40:35,764 --> 00:40:37,307
Yes, sir.

379
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:40,228
They'll keep your cobblers warm, Casper.

380
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,600
- Take your vest and underpants off.
- Don't wear 'em, sir.

381
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:51,348
Casper, tuck 'em in.
Thi privates are showin'.

382
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:53,403
The muscleman o' t'year!

383
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,370
- He's just come back from Biafra.
- Pull them up, Casper!

384
00:40:59,464 --> 00:41:02,499
- Pull them up!
- Like that, sir?

385
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:05,430
Pull them down, Casper.

386
00:41:05,514 --> 00:41:07,757
You're too daft to laugh at.

387
00:41:07,851 --> 00:41:10,135
Right. They'll do there.

388
00:41:10,228 --> 00:41:14,766
You lot, come on, get changed.
Wasted enough time already.

389
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,562
I'll give you a sample
of my footballing skills.

390
00:41:17,656 --> 00:41:20,858
A rare delight.

391
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:27,326
Watch yourself, Casper!

392
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,373
I won't tell you again, Crossland!

393
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:34,085
Come on, move.

394
00:41:34,888 --> 00:41:37,214
Off that goal post!

395
00:41:37,308 --> 00:41:40,594
Off that goal post.
I'll be up there in a minute!

396
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:44,736
Come here, Tibbut.
We'll pick two teams. You're the captain.

397
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:47,813
Right, line up on the halfway line, quickly.

398
00:41:47,907 --> 00:41:51,694
- I'll have first pick. Paget.
- That's not fair. You'll get t'best players.

399
00:41:51,787 --> 00:41:54,739
D'you wanna play football,
or d'you wanna do some maths?

400
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,825
Paget, then. Come here.

401
00:41:56,919 --> 00:41:58,327
- Speed.
- Walker.

402
00:41:58,421 --> 00:41:59,799
- Clark.
- Crossland.

403
00:41:59,882 --> 00:42:02,083
- Kelsey.
- Rowe.

404
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:05,713
Er... Clegg.

405
00:42:07,017 --> 00:42:09,134
Bloody hell, I'm frozen already.

406
00:42:09,228 --> 00:42:11,346
- Joyce.
- Birkinshaw.

407
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,766
- Ryder.
- Parker.

408
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,426
- Norton.
- Come on, Parker.

409
00:42:17,323 --> 00:42:19,941
Casper, I've got to have yer. Come on.

410
00:42:20,035 --> 00:42:22,821
Don't act the goat.
Come on, put 'em round your waist.

411
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,781
Now.

412
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,782
Right, we'll play with the wind,
downhill, this way.

413
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:35,453
Paget, you're inside right. Come on.

414
00:42:42,107 --> 00:42:46,353
- Who are you today, sir? Liverpool?
- Don't you know your club colours?

415
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:50,067
- Manchester United, this.
- Are you playing Denis Law, striker?

416
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,375
No. Charlton today, lad.
All over the field. Too cold for striker.

417
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:57,025
Charlton's not as quick
ont' turn as Law, is he?

418
00:42:57,129 --> 00:42:59,497
- You tryin' to tell me about football?
- No. l...

419
00:42:59,591 --> 00:43:03,753
You trying to tell me? Anyway,
Denis Law's in the wash this week.

420
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:11,389
- Nobody's in goal, sir.
- No goalie, sir.

421
00:43:11,483 --> 00:43:13,516
- Who's in the goals?
- Casper.

422
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:17,658
- Casper, what position are you playing?
- Don't know, sir. lnside left?

423
00:43:17,741 --> 00:43:20,777
How can you be inside left
back there, idiot? In the goals.

424
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:24,949
- I can't...
- Now's your chance to learn. In the goals.

425
00:43:25,043 --> 00:43:27,370
Quick about it.

426
00:43:27,464 --> 00:43:32,210
- We're Manchester United. Who are you?
- Spurs, then there's no clash of colours.

427
00:43:32,303 --> 00:43:38,260
Right, then, it's Manchester United versus
Spurs in this cup tie here at Old Trafford.

428
00:43:38,354 --> 00:43:41,973
And it's the fair-haired,
slightly balding Charlton to kick off.

429
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:58,330
Come on, Speed.
What you playin' at, lad?

430
00:43:58,424 --> 00:44:01,626
Yer should be on the move, lad.
lt was at yer feet!

431
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:04,046
Cross it, Ryder. Quickly.

432
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,633
Where's t'rest of my team?

433
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:17,231
Come on, quickly, Casper. I've never
seen such slack work in my life.

434
00:44:21,414 --> 00:44:24,251
- What's that for, sir?
- Slack work, lad. Slack work.

435
00:44:24,335 --> 00:44:26,901
Hit that ball up the field, Parker.

436
00:44:29,425 --> 00:44:31,668
I have to keep this shirt on after.

437
00:44:31,762 --> 00:44:33,545
Cross the ball!

438
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:36,049
And Charlton goes through, and...

439
00:44:36,143 --> 00:44:38,637
Oh, never! Never!

440
00:44:41,066 --> 00:44:42,809
- Penalty!
- Never.

441
00:44:42,903 --> 00:44:45,468
Who do you think you are? Bremner?

442
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:50,445
- Penalty.
- No, it weren't, sir!

443
00:44:50,539 --> 00:44:52,614
Outside that semicircle.

444
00:44:56,213 --> 00:44:59,833
- Shall I take it, sir?
- I take the penalties on this team.

445
00:45:03,932 --> 00:45:06,499
No one moves till this ball's kicked.

446
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:13,278
Just watch this, Guthrie. Right, Clegg?

447
00:45:16,909 --> 00:45:20,278
You moved. You moved. Put it back.

448
00:45:27,716 --> 00:45:29,583
Penalty.

449
00:45:30,887 --> 00:45:33,380
Behind the 18-yard line.

450
00:45:34,851 --> 00:45:37,970
Tha better save it, Cleggy!
Else I'll drop tha.

451
00:45:40,984 --> 00:45:43,550
- He moved!
- I didn't move, sir.

452
00:45:43,655 --> 00:45:46,148
The referee's decision is final.

453
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:07,344
- You should have done it the first time.
- And that, boys, is how to take a penalty.

454
00:46:08,106 --> 00:46:10,599
Look one way and kick the other.

455
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:13,687
Come on, Tibbut, lad.

456
00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:17,401
And Bobby Charlton has
equalised for Manchester United,

457
00:46:17,494 --> 00:46:19,486
and the score is one goal each.

458
00:46:25,339 --> 00:46:29,918
That fat twat!
He wants bleedin' milkin'. That big fat git!

459
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,965
What did you say? What did you say?

460
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:37,345
- Nowt, sir.
- Get off! In that changin' room! Get off!

461
00:46:37,439 --> 00:46:40,005
- I didn't say nowt, sir.
- Off!

462
00:46:40,944 --> 00:46:45,565
- I won't tolerate that on a football pitch.
- That's our captain, sir.

463
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:49,279
I don't care who he is.
You play this game like gentlemen.

464
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:52,783
Right inside!

465
00:46:55,297 --> 00:46:57,791
An early bath for you, lad.

466
00:47:00,471 --> 00:47:03,965
- I'll bounce the ball up.
- It's not fair! They never get sent off!

467
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:08,890
- I shall be up there in a minute!
- They never get sent off, sir.

468
00:47:10,277 --> 00:47:12,352
Off!

469
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:23,201
What d'you think you two are doing?

470
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,333
- What are you doing?
- Practising, sir.

471
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:31,546
Show me what you're doing.

472
00:47:59,304 --> 00:48:01,380
Casper!

473
00:48:02,892 --> 00:48:06,804
Casper, what do you think you are, lad?
An ape?

474
00:48:06,898 --> 00:48:10,267
- All he needs now is a banana.
- Get down. I'll make you red hot.

475
00:48:16,328 --> 00:48:18,946
Thank you. Now, for my next trick...

476
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,983
I'll show you a trick! Get back in that goal!

477
00:48:29,263 --> 00:48:33,008
- What's up?
- That hurt. That ball, it's hard as iron.

478
00:48:33,102 --> 00:48:35,594
Ar, I know. It's like a stone, innit?

479
00:48:36,482 --> 00:48:40,226
- I'm bloody freezin'.
- My feet are like blocks o' ice.

480
00:48:40,362 --> 00:48:43,313
Me knees, look at 'em. They're goin' pale.

481
00:48:43,407 --> 00:48:45,974
Look at t'colour. It's gone white.

482
00:48:46,579 --> 00:48:48,738
Oh, I wish l'd brought a note.

483
00:49:09,069 --> 00:49:12,480
- Great goal, that, sir.
- I'll give yer "great goal", lad.

484
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:17,153
- Spurs into the sixth round of t'Cup.
- Sixth round? I'll give you six of the best.

485
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:19,949
- Lost again, sir?
- Fetch my tracksuit.

486
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:23,161
- Better luck next time.
- Disgusting!

487
00:49:32,143 --> 00:49:34,709
- In a hurry, Casper?
- I have to get home, sir.

488
00:49:34,813 --> 00:49:36,847
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

489
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:39,058
- Forgotten something?
- No, sir.

490
00:49:39,152 --> 00:49:41,229
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

491
00:49:42,532 --> 00:49:45,099
- What about the showers?
- I've had one, sir.

492
00:49:47,707 --> 00:49:50,700
- You can ask any of 'em, sir.
- I'll just do that.

493
00:49:51,879 --> 00:49:54,247
- Have you seen him have a shower?
- No, sir.

494
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,292
- Have you?
- No, sir.

495
00:49:56,385 --> 00:49:58,461
- Have you?
- No, sir.

496
00:50:01,309 --> 00:50:03,677
- Have you seen him have a shower?
- Who, sir?

497
00:50:03,771 --> 00:50:06,180
- Casper.
- When, sir?

498
00:50:06,274 --> 00:50:09,476
- Just now. Has he had a shower?
- Had a shower, sir?

499
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,522
Has Casper had a shower?

500
00:50:11,615 --> 00:50:14,650
What you fooling about at, lad?
Has Casper had a shower?

501
00:50:14,744 --> 00:50:18,364
- I don't think so, sir.
- Speed, you'll get what Casper just had.

502
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:23,507
No one's seen you have a shower,
Casper. Cos you haven't had one.

503
00:50:23,716 --> 00:50:27,627
- Me mam says I ain't to have a shower.
- Come here. What's your mother say?

504
00:50:27,721 --> 00:50:30,839
I ain't to have a shower, sir.
I've got a cold.

505
00:50:30,933 --> 00:50:34,303
- Where's your note, then?
- Can I bring it this afternoon, sir?

506
00:50:34,397 --> 00:50:36,963
That's no good, lad. I want one now.

507
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:40,395
Any boy wishing to be excused
physical education, or showers,

508
00:50:40,489 --> 00:50:44,943
must, at the time of the lesson,
produce a sealed letter of explanation

509
00:50:45,037 --> 00:50:47,948
signed by one of his parents
or his legal guardian.

510
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:50,826
- Go on, sir, let me go home.
- You can go, lad.

511
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,486
Hey, come here.
When you've had a shower.

512
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,794
- I haven't a towel, sir.
- Borrow one.

513
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,508
- Nobody'll lend me one.
- Have a drip-dry, then. Shower, come on.

514
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,972
- MacDowall.
- Sir?

515
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:07,934
Come here, lad.

516
00:51:08,028 --> 00:51:11,522
Come here. What's this?

517
00:51:11,616 --> 00:51:13,692
Our dog did it, sir.

518
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,654
- Your dog did it?
- Aye.

519
00:51:16,748 --> 00:51:19,450
lt bit me while I were fightin' it last night.

520
00:51:20,962 --> 00:51:23,529
A dog wearing nylons, lads.

521
00:51:31,686 --> 00:51:33,761
Bloody heck!

522
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:41,773
- Still in a hurry?
- Can I go now, sir?

523
00:51:41,867 --> 00:51:44,402
- Have a proper wash.
- I've had one, sir.

524
00:51:44,496 --> 00:51:47,657
- In the shower, lad. In the shower.
- I've got to get home.

525
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,826
ln the shower.

526
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:54,467
Ryder, Speed, come here.

527
00:51:54,551 --> 00:51:57,117
Yes, you two. Come on.

528
00:51:57,222 --> 00:51:59,788
Stay here and see that
he doesn't come out.

529
00:51:59,892 --> 00:52:02,343
- Do what, sir?
- I said, stay there.

530
00:52:02,437 --> 00:52:04,930
See that he doesn't come out.

531
00:52:12,493 --> 00:52:15,612
Agh! Sir! It's gone cold!

532
00:52:16,457 --> 00:52:21,454
Got a sweat on, Casper? I thought you
might need a cooler after your exertions.

533
00:52:21,547 --> 00:52:27,254
It's not right, sir. I'll catch me death
of cold in here. It's not right.

534
00:52:27,348 --> 00:52:30,717
Was it right when you
let that goal in deliberately?

535
00:52:34,566 --> 00:52:37,267
- Can't we go for us dinners?
- No, you can stay there.

536
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:40,981
- We're servers.
- I don't care. They can serve themselves.

537
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:46,030
You shouldn't put me in goal.
You know I'm useless.

538
00:52:46,123 --> 00:52:48,617
Now's your chance to learn.

539
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:52,372
Shall we let him out, sir?
He'll catch his death of cold.

540
00:52:52,466 --> 00:52:55,669
- He'll catch pneumonia.
- I don't care what he gets.

541
00:52:55,763 --> 00:52:58,673
lf he thinks I'm running
my blood to water for 90 minutes,

542
00:52:58,767 --> 00:53:03,346
for him to deliberately throw the game
away, he's got another think coming.

543
00:53:05,985 --> 00:53:08,103
Sir, we've got to go for us dinner.

544
00:53:15,248 --> 00:53:19,077
- Get down!
- He looks like a bleedin' snake!

545
00:53:19,171 --> 00:53:21,736
Think yourself lucky.

546
00:54:40,618 --> 00:54:42,819
- 'Ey up, Jud. How yer doin'?
- Rough, man.

547
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:46,241
Why? You should be on top of the world
on a day like today.

548
00:54:46,335 --> 00:54:49,453
Another ten minutes
and I'll be at t'bottom of it.

549
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:09,160
Only, O Lord, in Thy dear love

550
00:56:09,243 --> 00:56:15,408
Fit us for perfect rest above

551
00:56:15,877 --> 00:56:21,250
And help us this and every day

552
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:29,553
To live more nearly as we pray

553
00:56:29,647 --> 00:56:35,436
Amen

554
00:56:41,163 --> 00:56:46,869
This morning's reading is taken from
Matthew, chapter 18, verses 10-1 4.

555
00:56:47,463 --> 00:56:50,457
"Never despise one of these little ones,
I tell you."

556
00:56:50,551 --> 00:56:52,794
"They have their guardian angels
in heaven

557
00:56:52,888 --> 00:56:56,465
who look continually
on the face of my heavenly father."

558
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,220
"Suppose a man has a hundred sheep.
lf one of them strays,

559
00:57:00,314 --> 00:57:03,100
does he not leave
the other 99 on the hillside

560
00:57:03,194 --> 00:57:05,520
and go in search of the one that strayed?"

561
00:57:05,614 --> 00:57:08,650
"And if he should find it, I tell you this,

562
00:57:08,744 --> 00:57:13,239
he is more delighted over that sheep
than over the 99 that never strayed."

563
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:16,170
"ln the same way,
it is not your heavenly father's will

564
00:57:16,253 --> 00:57:21,251
that one of these little ones should be
lost." Here ends this morning's reading.

565
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,553
Stop! Stop that infernal coughing.

566
00:57:28,647 --> 00:57:34,352
Every morning alike. Clear your throats
on the way to school, not here.

567
00:57:34,446 --> 00:57:38,191
Sounds more like a dirt track
than an assembly hall.

568
00:57:42,332 --> 00:57:45,660
Come out! Come out, that boy!

569
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:46,722
Who coughed? 

570
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,822
Mr Hesketh, somewhere near you, I think.

571
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,253
Fetch that boy out!

572
00:57:52,229 --> 00:57:54,595
MacDowall, it was you.
You were coughing.

573
00:57:54,689 --> 00:57:56,681
- lt weren't.
- Yes, it was. I heard you.

574
00:57:56,774 --> 00:57:58,557
- lt weren't, sir.
- Don't argue.

575
00:57:58,651 --> 00:58:01,487
- lt weren't me, honest.
- Headmaster's study.

576
00:58:01,571 --> 00:58:04,604
MacDowall! I might have known!
Get to my office!

577
00:58:04,698 --> 00:58:07,815
- lt weren't me, sir.
- And heaven help you.

578
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:12,779
We will now say the Lord's Prayer.

579
00:58:13,373 --> 00:58:15,937
Hands together, eyes closed.

580
00:58:16,042 --> 00:58:17,658
Our Father...

581
00:58:17,752 --> 00:58:19,660
Our Father

582
00:58:19,753 --> 00:58:23,882
which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

583
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,458
Thy kingdom come.

584
00:58:27,552 --> 00:58:29,711
Thy will be done...

585
00:58:37,395 --> 00:58:40,470
- Does he bite yer?
- He's had a little kid's hand off nearly.

586
00:58:40,564 --> 00:58:44,505
Has it? My, my, my!
What's it fastened on? A wire?

587
00:58:44,609 --> 00:58:48,227
Aye. It's broke this off an' all.
Just darted at t'kid and got him.

588
00:58:48,321 --> 00:58:52,147
Well, I don't know, I'm sure.
ls that what you've got t'glove on for?

589
00:58:52,241 --> 00:58:55,151
- Yeah. Just in case it gets me.
- Aye. Aye.

590
00:58:56,121 --> 00:58:57,903
- What d'yer call it?
- Kes.

591
00:58:57,997 --> 00:59:01,938
Kes? Aye. He is a nice bird.

592
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:07,454
I shouldn't like to handle him.

593
00:59:07,548 --> 00:59:11,165
Casper! Casper! Up, lad! On yer feet!

594
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:15,169
- You were asleep, weren't you, Casper?
- I don't know, sir.

595
00:59:15,263 --> 00:59:17,879
I know! You were. You were asleep.

596
00:59:17,973 --> 00:59:20,539
Why were you asleep,
you irreverent scoundrel?

597
00:59:20,643 --> 00:59:22,634
- Don't know, sir.
- I know why!

598
00:59:22,728 --> 00:59:26,220
You were roaming the streets at night
instead of being home in bed.

599
00:59:26,314 --> 00:59:31,517
See me in my office afterwards! I'll give
you something to sleep about! Sit!

600
00:59:33,696 --> 00:59:35,563
Here are the announcements.

601
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:40,859
The youth employment officer will be
here today to meet the Easter leavers.

602
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:43,278
Your parents should have been told.

603
00:59:43,372 --> 00:59:47,532
lf any boy has forgotten and thinks his
parents may wish to attend his interview,

604
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:52,828
then he can consult the list on the main
notice board for the approximate times.

605
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:59,000
And finally, for three members
of the smokers' union

606
00:59:59,094 --> 01:00:02,462
caught yesterday behind
the games storeroom,

607
01:00:02,555 --> 01:00:06,299
there will be a meeting
with me after assembly,

608
01:00:06,393 --> 01:00:10,719
when I will be pleased to see
and hear them pay their dues.

609
01:00:10,938 --> 01:00:13,973
He'd better not stick me.
I'm fetchin' me father up if he does.

610
01:00:14,067 --> 01:00:17,184
What yer bringin' yer father down for?
He don't do nowt.

611
01:00:17,278 --> 01:00:19,947
- How d'yer mean?
- Last time, he got stick an' all.

612
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:22,397
Shut up, will tha? I'm sick of hearin' yer.

613
01:00:22,491 --> 01:00:24,732
When he came,
they were laughin' at him.

614
01:00:24,826 --> 01:00:27,067
- Yer what?
- Yeah. Weren't they?

615
01:00:27,912 --> 01:00:30,478
Don't say that about my father, right?

616
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:35,742
He's not gonna beat me, anyhow.

617
01:00:35,836 --> 01:00:38,912
- What do you want?
- I've got a message for Mr Gryce.

618
01:00:39,006 --> 01:00:40,872
Better wait in the queue, then.

619
01:00:40,966 --> 01:00:44,625
He likes to keep yer waitin'.
He thinks it makes it worse.

620
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:48,003
He can keep me till four o'clock.
I'm not bothered.

621
01:00:48,097 --> 01:00:50,798
l'd rather the cane than do lessons.

622
01:00:50,892 --> 01:00:53,175
Come here, you.

623
01:00:53,269 --> 01:00:56,177
Save us these till after
we come outta Gryce's.

624
01:00:56,271 --> 01:00:57,888
He'll think I'm a smoker.

625
01:00:57,981 --> 01:01:02,194
He'll not search you but he'll search us,
and if he finds 'em, we'll get two extra.

626
01:01:02,277 --> 01:01:04,727
- I don't want 'em.
- You want some fist instead?

627
01:01:04,821 --> 01:01:08,147
- You want to take them?
- You'd better, lad.

628
01:01:09,492 --> 01:01:12,776
OK. But if I get caned,
you give me something.

629
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:15,779
Aye. Some fist if yer don't.

630
01:01:18,292 --> 01:01:20,960
'Ey up, he's here - Gryce Pudding.

631
01:01:21,503 --> 01:01:23,745
Single file.

632
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,830
Right. You lost, lad?

633
01:01:25,923 --> 01:01:29,041
- Please, sir, I'm going...
- On yer way, form room.

634
01:01:31,804 --> 01:01:34,588
You lot, inside.

635
01:01:38,268 --> 01:01:40,594
Same old faces.

636
01:01:40,771 --> 01:01:43,888
Same old faces.

637
01:01:44,608 --> 01:01:46,849
Ten years this school's been opened,

638
01:01:46,943 --> 01:01:51,895
and ten years have we seen, after
every assembly, a line of boys here,

639
01:01:51,989 --> 01:01:54,522
and the same old faces.

640
01:01:54,616 --> 01:01:58,776
- Sir, I've got a message...
- Shut up. Don't interrupt. Close the door.

641
01:02:00,998 --> 01:02:04,115
I've taught in this city for over 30 years.

642
01:02:04,292 --> 01:02:08,619
I taught some of your parents -
your father, MacDowall -

643
01:02:08,713 --> 01:02:11,121
in the old slum schools in the city,

644
01:02:11,215 --> 01:02:16,209
before they built this fine estate,
and this wonderful school.

645
01:02:17,221 --> 01:02:20,713
Things are no better now
than they were then.

646
01:02:20,807 --> 01:02:23,424
I just can't understand this generation.

647
01:02:23,518 --> 01:02:26,302
I thought I knew something
about young people.

648
01:02:26,396 --> 01:02:29,680
I should be able to,
you know, with my experience.

649
01:02:29,774 --> 01:02:31,932
But with you, no.

650
01:02:32,025 --> 01:02:36,603
lt just seems a complete
waste of money and a waste of time.

651
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:39,699
And it's a waste of time
talking to you now.

652
01:02:39,782 --> 01:02:42,108
- You're not listening, are you?
- Yes, sir.

653
01:02:42,202 --> 01:02:44,985
You're not! Crossland,
you're not listening, are you?

654
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:47,113
- I am, sir.
- None of you are listening!

655
01:02:47,207 --> 01:02:49,771
Look at that glazed expression
on your faces.

656
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:54,088
You never listen!
Yours is the generation that never listens!

657
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:56,735
Cos we can never tell you anything.

658
01:02:57,591 --> 01:03:00,499
You're the sophisticated ones,

659
01:03:00,593 --> 01:03:03,795
with all your music, and your gear.

660
01:03:03,889 --> 01:03:07,423
But, you know, it's superficial.
It's a sheen.

661
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:10,634
There's nothing solid
or worthwhile underneath.

662
01:03:10,728 --> 01:03:13,428
And why do I know this?

663
01:03:13,522 --> 01:03:17,849
Why do I know there's been
no advance in discipline or decency,

664
01:03:17,942 --> 01:03:20,143
or morals or manners?

665
01:03:20,237 --> 01:03:25,814
Why do I know it? Because I still
have to use this to you boys every day.

666
01:03:26,075 --> 01:03:30,777
Why? In the '20s and '30s,
I could understand it.

667
01:03:30,871 --> 01:03:32,654
They were hard times,

668
01:03:32,748 --> 01:03:36,283
but they produced qualities in people
that you lot will never have.

669
01:03:36,376 --> 01:03:39,243
I can be stopped in the street
by someone I taught then.

670
01:03:39,337 --> 01:03:44,206
We'll talk about the old days, and we'll
laugh about the thrashings I gave him.

671
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,865
But what do I get from you lot?

672
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:51,755
A honk from a greasy,
pimply-faced youth

673
01:03:52,182 --> 01:03:55,091
sitting at the wheel
of a big second-hand car.

674
01:03:55,977 --> 01:03:59,720
I don't know. I just don't know.

675
01:04:00,523 --> 01:04:05,518
No guts! No backbone!
Nothing to commend you whatsoever.

676
01:04:05,611 --> 01:04:08,520
Mere fodder for the mass media.

677
01:04:12,618 --> 01:04:16,861
And so, until someone
produces a better solution,

678
01:04:16,955 --> 01:04:19,446
I'll continue to use this cane,

679
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:24,451
knowing fully well that you'll be
back for it time and time and time again.

680
01:04:26,172 --> 01:04:30,113
You smokers will go out of here
with your hands ringing.

681
01:04:30,217 --> 01:04:34,544
Will it stop you smoking? You're already
looking forward to smoking at break.

682
01:04:34,638 --> 01:04:36,712
- What are you grinning about?
- Not grinnin'.

683
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:40,257
You are! I'll bet you're already
thinking about smoking at break.

684
01:04:40,351 --> 01:04:42,259
Empty your pockets.

685
01:04:42,353 --> 01:04:46,972
I bet they're loaded with cigarettes.
Come on, all of you, empty your pockets.

686
01:04:49,693 --> 01:04:52,185
- Please, sir...
- Quiet. Empty your pockets.

687
01:04:52,278 --> 01:04:54,604
- You don't understand.
- Empty your pockets.

688
01:04:55,198 --> 01:04:57,064
Disgusting!

689
01:04:59,952 --> 01:05:01,902
Please, sir.

690
01:05:01,996 --> 01:05:04,404
You again? You again?!

691
01:05:04,498 --> 01:05:07,533
- Yes, sir.
- Empty your pockets.

692
01:05:07,626 --> 01:05:12,036
- But, sir, I've got a message from Mrs...
- Empty your pockets!

693
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:16,331
I don't believe it.

694
01:05:17,927 --> 01:05:20,169
I don't believe this.

695
01:05:22,264 --> 01:05:26,508
Empty your pockets, lad.
Empty your pockets when you're told!

696
01:05:26,602 --> 01:05:28,801
Come on, lad.

697
01:05:28,895 --> 01:05:30,762
Ah!

698
01:05:32,441 --> 01:05:36,100
A regular little cigarette factory,
aren't you?

699
01:05:36,194 --> 01:05:38,268
Yes, sir.

700
01:05:42,366 --> 01:05:44,858
Put that rubbish away!

701
01:06:07,222 --> 01:06:10,297
Now I hope it's going to be
a lesson to you.

702
01:06:10,391 --> 01:06:13,259
I don't suppose for one minute it will be.

703
01:06:13,353 --> 01:06:17,763
I don't doubt before the end of the week
you'll be back in here again

704
01:06:17,857 --> 01:06:20,422
for exactly the same crime, smoking.

705
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:25,823
Perhaps, once in a while, it might sink in.

706
01:06:25,906 --> 01:06:29,107
- Yes, sir.
- That you're wasting your money,

707
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:31,275
that it's your money you're burning,

708
01:06:31,369 --> 01:06:35,279
and it's your hands that get caned
when you come in here.

709
01:06:38,626 --> 01:06:41,952
Good morning. Entry of the gladiators.
Where have you been?

710
01:06:42,046 --> 01:06:44,287
- Been to see Mr Gryce, sir.
- For the stick?

711
01:06:44,381 --> 01:06:45,841
- Yes, sir.
- How many?

712
01:06:45,924 --> 01:06:47,999
- Two.
- Did it hurt?

713
01:06:48,092 --> 01:06:51,377
- Not bad.
- Right. Hope it didn't.

714
01:06:51,888 --> 01:06:53,963
Go on, sit down.

715
01:06:56,141 --> 01:06:58,175
Right now, fact.

716
01:06:58,269 --> 01:07:01,803
Anne, tell me what a fact is.

717
01:07:01,897 --> 01:07:03,846
Don't give me a fact.

718
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:08,809
You know, don't say that Guthrie's
got a tatty head or anything like that.

719
01:07:08,903 --> 01:07:12,980
A fact is something where
you find evidence out, like truth.

720
01:07:13,658 --> 01:07:16,691
Something that you know
has actually happened.

721
01:07:16,785 --> 01:07:19,903
This is a fact. All right?
Have you got that clear?

722
01:07:19,996 --> 01:07:22,750
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

723
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:26,034
Tibbut, sit up straight.

724
01:07:26,127 --> 01:07:29,119
And I want the rest of yer
to look at him - if you can bear it -

725
01:07:29,213 --> 01:07:31,779
and tell me some facts about Tibbut.

726
01:07:32,175 --> 01:07:35,084
- Wolstenholme?
- He's always tryin' to go wi' t'lasses.

727
01:07:35,178 --> 01:07:37,961
ls he?

728
01:07:38,764 --> 01:07:41,255
- He smokes.
- Do I heck!

729
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,967
- Tha does.
- Get knotted, Guthrie!

730
01:07:44,061 --> 01:07:47,220
I'm not interested in what
he does out of school hours,

731
01:07:47,314 --> 01:07:51,474
as long as he doesn't come into
the class smokin' a fag. All right?

732
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:55,446
Come on, you people who aren't thinking.

733
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,615
Right, Julie.

734
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:03,902
I want you to think of an incident that's
happened to you sometime in the past,

735
01:08:03,995 --> 01:08:09,073
that is true, and that you think
will interest the rest of the class. All right?

736
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:11,742
Well, er...

737
01:08:11,836 --> 01:08:15,120
I went to this all-night party yesterday.
And, er...

738
01:08:17,924 --> 01:08:21,793
about three o'clock,
we were dancin' int' garden -

739
01:08:23,138 --> 01:08:26,380
me and her and all the rest,
can't mention names -

740
01:08:26,474 --> 01:08:30,134
and, er, this woman
come across from t'road,

741
01:08:30,227 --> 01:08:32,428
and, er, she tells us to...

742
01:08:32,521 --> 01:08:36,848
to make less noise,
or she'd fetch t'police.

743
01:08:36,942 --> 01:08:41,269
So, well... so we said,
let her fetch 'em if she wanted.

744
01:08:41,363 --> 01:08:43,927
So she fetched 'em.

745
01:08:46,368 --> 01:08:50,695
Things that have actually happened.
How about another one?

746
01:08:50,789 --> 01:08:52,946
What about you, Casper?

747
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:56,116
- Casper!
- What, sir?

748
01:08:56,209 --> 01:09:00,338
"What, sir?"
You'd know if you'd been listening.

749
01:09:00,422 --> 01:09:02,987
What have we just been talking about?

750
01:09:04,133 --> 01:09:06,886
- Stories, sir?
- What kind of stories?

751
01:09:10,348 --> 01:09:13,423
- You haven't been listening, have yer?
- Yes. Some of it.

752
01:09:13,517 --> 01:09:15,591
Some of it?!

753
01:09:16,394 --> 01:09:18,470
Stand up!

754
01:09:23,068 --> 01:09:25,476
You're gonna tell us
a story about yourself.

755
01:09:25,570 --> 01:09:29,187
- I don't know any, sir.
- Well, you stand there till yer do.

756
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:37,028
Always somebody, isn't there, eh?
Somebody who wants to be awkward.

757
01:09:37,122 --> 01:09:40,739
Just won't be interested,
doesn't matter what you do.

758
01:09:42,043 --> 01:09:44,535
Just like you, Casper.

759
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,414
Come on.

760
01:09:50,384 --> 01:09:52,501
I'll give you two minutes

761
01:09:52,595 --> 01:09:56,536
to think of something, or the whole class
comes back at four o'clock.

762
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,799
- Come on, don't stand there like a nail.
- He is a nail.

763
01:09:59,893 --> 01:10:01,133
Come on.

764
01:10:01,227 --> 01:10:05,888
- I say... tell him.
- Tell him about the hawk, Casper.

765
01:10:05,981 --> 01:10:09,683
lf anybody else calls out,
it'll be the last call they make!

766
01:10:10,444 --> 01:10:13,644
- Speed?
- He's got this hawk. He's mad over it.

767
01:10:13,738 --> 01:10:18,107
He just goes wi' t'hawk all t'time.
He's crackers over it.

768
01:10:18,201 --> 01:10:21,319
- Better than thee, anyroad.
- All right, Casper.

769
01:10:22,538 --> 01:10:24,613
Sit down.

770
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:30,420
Now, come on, tell us about this hawk.
Where'd you get it from?

771
01:10:30,504 --> 01:10:33,205
- I found it, sir.
- Where?

772
01:10:33,299 --> 01:10:36,134
- lnt' woods.
- Where d'you keep it?

773
01:10:36,218 --> 01:10:39,126
- In a shed.
- What do you feed it on?

774
01:10:40,054 --> 01:10:42,546
Beef. Mice. Birds.

775
01:10:43,224 --> 01:10:46,967
lsn't it cruel to keep it in a shed?
Wouldn't it be happier flying free?

776
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:50,553
I don't keep it int' shed all the time, sir.
I fly it every day.

777
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:54,890
- Doesn't it fly away?
- Course it don't fly away. I've trained it.

778
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,894
Are you gonna tell us about it?
How do you train a hawk?

779
01:10:57,988 --> 01:11:00,938
You have to be right careful wi' 'em,
sir, right patient.

780
01:11:01,032 --> 01:11:03,315
You've got to feed 'em
when they're hungry.

781
01:11:03,409 --> 01:11:06,777
You can only do owt at feedin' time, sir.

782
01:11:06,871 --> 01:11:10,322
- Yeah?
- Got these jesses on, sir, all t'time.

783
01:11:10,416 --> 01:11:12,980
- These what?
- Jesses, sir.

784
01:11:13,085 --> 01:11:15,326
- How do you spell that?
- J-e...

785
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:19,330
All right. Come out here.
You'd better show us on the board.

786
01:11:19,424 --> 01:11:21,916
"Jesses". That's a new word to me.

787
01:11:22,635 --> 01:11:25,043
Hands up those who've
heard of jesses before?

788
01:11:25,137 --> 01:11:27,630
Nobody. Go on, write it up there.

789
01:11:33,019 --> 01:11:34,969
Right. Now tell us what it is.

790
01:11:35,063 --> 01:11:38,723
They're leather straps, sir.
And they attach to t'bird's feet.

791
01:11:38,817 --> 01:11:43,436
Say I've got t'bird on me hand. Straps
come down there. Then there's t'swivel.

792
01:11:43,529 --> 01:11:46,021
"Swivel". Write that on the board.

793
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:55,029
- Then you've got your leash.
- "Leash". On the board.

794
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,741
I fed it on me hand first.

795
01:11:58,835 --> 01:12:01,910
Then, when it got to know me,
I fed it on me glove.

796
01:12:02,505 --> 01:12:07,082
And after a while,
I put it two inches away from its claws.

797
01:12:07,176 --> 01:12:09,876
And, er... Like that, right?

798
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:14,922
lt started to jump for t'meat. When it
started to jump, I could move me hand.

799
01:12:15,016 --> 01:12:18,759
- Hold your hand up, so we can see.
- I could move me hand away, like,

800
01:12:18,853 --> 01:12:23,430
to four inches and six inches. And when it
were doin' that, I started it wi' t'leash.

801
01:12:23,524 --> 01:12:27,309
Do they need water? When you've got
a budgie, you put water in the cage.

802
01:12:27,402 --> 01:12:30,353
Do they need water like that?

803
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:35,107
Well, it, like, has a bath. lt has a bath
right early on int' morning, like.

804
01:12:36,369 --> 01:12:39,319
When do yer feed it?
How many times a day?

805
01:12:39,413 --> 01:12:42,113
To start off with,
three or four, to get it plump.

806
01:12:42,207 --> 01:12:44,449
- You make it sound very exciting.
- lt is.

807
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:47,452
Most exciting thing was
when I flew her free first time.

808
01:12:47,546 --> 01:12:49,830
- Do you wanna hear about that?
- Yes, sir.

809
01:12:49,923 --> 01:12:51,873
Aye. Come on.

810
01:12:51,966 --> 01:12:56,293
Well, l'd been using t'creance
for about a week,

811
01:12:56,387 --> 01:12:59,056
and it had been goin' 30 or 40 yards.

812
01:12:59,139 --> 01:13:02,882
And it says when birds
are goin' 30-40 yards, it says int' book,

813
01:13:02,976 --> 01:13:05,542
it's time that it can start to fly free.

814
01:13:07,647 --> 01:13:10,484
Well, l'd been...

815
01:13:10,567 --> 01:13:15,769
l'd been wantin' to fly it free, but I daren't.
I were frightened it'd fly off or somethin'.

816
01:13:15,863 --> 01:13:18,189
This had been goin' on
for four or five days.

817
01:13:18,282 --> 01:13:22,151
And I keep on to missen,
sayin' that "Fly it free next day."

818
01:13:22,244 --> 01:13:27,406
Anyway, I got right mad wi' missen.
I says "Right, I'm flyin' it free tomorrow."

819
01:13:27,498 --> 01:13:29,991
Anyway, that night -
that Friday night it were -

820
01:13:30,085 --> 01:13:34,026
I didn't feed her up, so that
she'd be sharp set next mornin'.

821
01:13:34,297 --> 01:13:38,624
And I went to bed that night, Friday night,
and I didn't get an hour's sleep at all.

822
01:13:38,718 --> 01:13:43,420
I were frightened about t'bird,
that she'd fly off or summat like that.

823
01:13:43,514 --> 01:13:46,464
Anyway, when t'mornin' came,
I kept on sayin' to missen

824
01:13:46,558 --> 01:13:49,926
"lf she flies off, she flies off,
and it can't be helped."

825
01:13:50,019 --> 01:13:53,345
So I took t'swivel off
and let her hop onto t'post.

826
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:57,975
There were nowt stoppin' her, she could
fly off. All that were on her were jesses.

827
01:13:58,068 --> 01:14:01,019
I thought "She must fly off.
She's forced to fly off."

828
01:14:01,113 --> 01:14:04,647
But she didn't.
She just stood there. I were terrified.

829
01:14:04,741 --> 01:14:09,485
She was stood there, and I walked off
into t'field, and she were lookin' round,

830
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:14,031
and when I got about 70 yards from her,
in middle of t'field,

831
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:16,200
I called her.

832
01:14:17,002 --> 01:14:20,579
"Kes. Kes. Come on, Kes. Come on, then."

833
01:14:20,673 --> 01:14:23,999
Nowt happened. So I thought
"l'd better walk back and pick her up."

834
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:29,003
So while I were walkin' back,
I saw her flyin'. She came like a bomb!

835
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:33,507
About a yard off t'floor, like lightning,
head still, and you couldn't hear t'wings.

836
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,011
There weren't a sound from t'wings.
And straight onto t'glove. Wham!

837
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:39,596
And she grabbed me for t'meat.

838
01:14:40,566 --> 01:14:43,433
I were pleased wi' missen,
and I didn't know what to do.

839
01:14:43,527 --> 01:14:47,520
So I thought I better do it again,
just to prove it weren't luck.

840
01:14:47,614 --> 01:14:50,178
So I took her back onto t'post,

841
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:54,693
and walked up into t'middle of t'field,
and called her again.

842
01:14:54,787 --> 01:14:59,781
And she came just as good as first time,
straight onto t'glove, grabbin' for t'meat.

843
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:03,951
Well, that were it, sir. l'd trained her, sir,
and that were all I could do.

844
01:15:04,045 --> 01:15:07,580
I think you've done enough.
Well done, Billy. Big hand of applause.

845
01:15:21,937 --> 01:15:23,803
- Got owt, Casper?
- Nay.

846
01:15:23,897 --> 01:15:28,766
Tha never has. Tha just cadges. Casper
the Cadger, they ought to call thee.

847
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:32,185
- I wouldn't give thee owt if I had.
- I'll give thee summat.

848
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:34,772
What tha goin' for?
Don't tha like company?

849
01:15:34,866 --> 01:15:38,734
They say thi mother does. Tha's
got more uncles than any other kid.

850
01:15:38,827 --> 01:15:40,818
- Shut thi mouth!
- Make me.

851
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:44,321
- Tha wouldn't say that to our Jud.
- Your Jud's nowt.

852
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:46,532
What? He's cock of t'estate.

853
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:50,244
- I know somebody who could do him.
- Who? Thi father?

854
01:15:51,172 --> 01:15:54,008
- He in't even thi brother.
- What is he? Me sister?

855
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:56,124
They don't even call him Casper.

856
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:59,836
Course he's me brother!
We live int' same house, don't we?

857
01:16:01,514 --> 01:16:04,007
Get him! Get him!

858
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:15,726
Fight!

859
01:16:44,596 --> 01:16:47,160
Right, you lot!
Ten seconds, out of my sight!

860
01:16:47,265 --> 01:16:49,632
One! Two! Three!

861
01:16:56,481 --> 01:16:59,046
Right, come here, you two. Come on.

862
01:17:00,777 --> 01:17:03,342
- What's goin' on?
- lt was him, sir. He started it.

863
01:17:03,446 --> 01:17:06,563
- He's been chuckin' coal.
- Ah, shut up. Shut up!

864
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:11,484
It's always the same tale; somebody
else's fault, nobody's to blame.

865
01:17:11,578 --> 01:17:14,737
Look at the mess you're in!
Look at the state you've made!

866
01:17:14,831 --> 01:17:18,074
- Casper, you're not dead yet.
- He will be when I've had him.

867
01:17:18,168 --> 01:17:24,246
Oh, yes! You're a big lad, aren't yer? He's
just about your size, Casper, isn't he? Eh?

868
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,457
Pick on somebody your own size.

869
01:17:26,551 --> 01:17:30,628
What if I rubbed your nose in the coke?
You'd say I was a bully, wouldn't yer?

870
01:17:30,721 --> 01:17:35,298
And you'd be right. Cos I'm bigger
and stronger than you, aren't I? Eh?

871
01:17:35,391 --> 01:17:38,061
- I'll fetch me dad.
- Oh, yes. And I'll fetch mine.

872
01:17:38,145 --> 01:17:40,594
My dad's heavyweight
champion of the world,

873
01:17:40,688 --> 01:17:43,181
so what will your dad do then, eh?

874
01:17:45,818 --> 01:17:50,479
That's what it's like to be bullied.
You don't like it, do yer?

875
01:17:50,573 --> 01:17:54,649
You'll like it a bit less if I ever catch
you at it again. Do you understand it?

876
01:17:54,743 --> 01:17:56,817
Yes, sir.

877
01:17:57,537 --> 01:18:01,030
Get it shovelled up. Come here a minute.
Have you been smoking?

878
01:18:01,123 --> 01:18:03,908
- No, sir.
- You have! I can smell it on your breath.

879
01:18:04,002 --> 01:18:07,119
- No, sir.
- See me afterwards. Get it done. Go on.

880
01:18:20,599 --> 01:18:21,924
What's it all about?

881
01:18:22,018 --> 01:18:26,345
He keeps callin' me names, and sayin'
things about me dad and me mam and...

882
01:18:26,438 --> 01:18:28,972
All right, all right, all right. Calm down.

883
01:18:29,357 --> 01:18:31,766
They all seem to pick on you. Why is it?

884
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:34,143
- Don't know.
- ls it because you're a bad 'un?

885
01:18:34,237 --> 01:18:37,146
Maybe I am sometimes,
but I'm not that bad, sir.

886
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:42,234
I know stacks of other kids that's worse
than me, but they seem to get away wi' it.

887
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:47,030
Why else do you think, eh?
There must be some reason.

888
01:18:47,124 --> 01:18:49,408
Well, take this mornin', sir.

889
01:18:49,501 --> 01:18:52,535
I came in and just dozed off.
I weren't doin' nowt wrong.

890
01:18:52,629 --> 01:18:57,290
l'd been up since six. I had to do t'papers,
then I had to rush home to look at t'bird,

891
01:18:57,384 --> 01:19:00,543
and then run to school.
You'd be tired, wouldn't yer, sir?

892
01:19:00,637 --> 01:19:02,586
l'd be exhausted.

893
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:06,621
You shouldn't be caned for that, sir.
And you can't tell Mr Gryce that.

894
01:19:06,725 --> 01:19:11,719
And this little lad, sir. He'd only brought
a letter from a teacher, and he got t'cane.

895
01:19:12,564 --> 01:19:16,182
It's nowt to laugh at, sir.
Afterwards, he was sick as a dog.

896
01:19:17,485 --> 01:19:20,436
And teachers, sir.
They're not bothered about us, sir.

897
01:19:20,530 --> 01:19:23,939
lf we're 4C, they think
we're numbskulls, owt like that, sir.

898
01:19:24,033 --> 01:19:28,610
They're always lookin' at their watches,
to see how long there's left of t'lesson.

899
01:19:28,704 --> 01:19:32,645
They're not bothered about us,
and we're not bothered about them.

900
01:19:35,877 --> 01:19:38,202
How are things at home these days?

901
01:19:38,296 --> 01:19:40,704
All right, sir. Usual, I suppose.

902
01:19:40,798 --> 01:19:43,165
- Been in trouble with the police recently?
- No, sir.

903
01:19:43,258 --> 01:19:46,418
Not since I've been
without MacDowall's gang.

904
01:19:46,512 --> 01:19:50,505
You know, they used to go into t'city
and go into t'coffee bars and t'cinema,

905
01:19:50,599 --> 01:19:53,382
but since I've been without them
I've been all right.

906
01:19:53,476 --> 01:19:57,261
- It's all right now, innit?
- But when there's trouble on estate,

907
01:19:57,355 --> 01:20:00,305
all the police come to our house.

908
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:02,599
Well, I shouldn't worry.

909
01:20:02,693 --> 01:20:06,634
ln a couple of weeks you'll be starting
your new job, gettin' new friends.

910
01:20:06,739 --> 01:20:11,483
Lookin' forward to that, are yer?
Eh? Have you got a job?

911
01:20:11,576 --> 01:20:13,943
No, sir. I've got to see
t'employment bloke.

912
01:20:14,037 --> 01:20:16,570
- What sort of job do you want?
- Anything'll do me.

913
01:20:16,664 --> 01:20:20,032
But you want something that
you're interested in, don't you?

914
01:20:20,126 --> 01:20:23,994
- I'll take what I've got.
- I thought you wanted to leave school.

915
01:20:24,088 --> 01:20:26,652
- Not bothered.
- Thought you didn't like school.

916
01:20:26,757 --> 01:20:31,292
I don't, but it dun't mean to say I'll like
work. Still, I'll get paid for not likin' it.

917
01:20:31,386 --> 01:20:34,420
- That's one thing.
- I suppose it is.

918
01:20:34,514 --> 01:20:38,507
I might be able to save up and buy
a goshawk. I've been readin' about 'em.

919
01:20:38,601 --> 01:20:41,009
Have yer? When do you fly
this hawk o' yours?

920
01:20:41,103 --> 01:20:42,844
- Dinner times.
- Where?

921
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:45,502
- Just outside our house, sir.
- Wood Lane?

922
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:49,226
- Yeah, it is, sir.
- I'll come round, then. lf it's OK.

923
01:20:51,404 --> 01:20:53,969
Go on, then. Get yourself cleaned up.

924
01:22:01,969 --> 01:22:06,379
"Five bob double.
Crackpot. Tell Him He's Dead."

925
01:22:06,473 --> 01:22:08,339
"Jud."

926
01:22:09,475 --> 01:22:11,551
Bloody hellfire!

927
01:22:41,087 --> 01:22:43,580
Kes! Come on, then.

928
01:22:45,216 --> 01:22:47,083
Kes!

929
01:22:47,677 --> 01:22:49,751
Come on, then, Kes.

930
01:22:50,638 --> 01:22:52,505
Come on.

931
01:22:58,353 --> 01:23:00,428
Come on, Kes.

932
01:23:04,484 --> 01:23:06,850
Casper?

933
01:23:06,944 --> 01:23:09,270
Bloody hellfire!

934
01:23:09,364 --> 01:23:12,898
- Hope I'm not too late.
- No. But you'll have to stand over there.

935
01:23:12,992 --> 01:23:15,556
- I'll go by the fence, eh?
- It's all right.

936
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:19,988
- As long as you keep quiet.
- I'll not say a word.

937
01:23:31,967 --> 01:23:34,043
Come on, Kes!

938
01:23:38,932 --> 01:23:41,007
Come on, Kes!

939
01:23:42,019 --> 01:23:43,884
Kes!

940
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:48,305
Come on, Kes!

941
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:54,061
Come on, Kes!

942
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,315
Kes!

943
01:24:21,763 --> 01:24:26,632
Well done, Casper. The most exciting
thing I've ever seen in me life. Great!

944
01:24:27,518 --> 01:24:30,271
- Thrill of a lifetime, lad.
- Thank you, sir.

945
01:24:30,354 --> 01:24:33,137
Let's have a look at it.

946
01:24:33,231 --> 01:24:35,797
lsn't it beautifully marked, eh?

947
01:24:38,153 --> 01:24:41,812
Look at the feathers on it.
Oh, it's not gonna eat that, is it?

948
01:24:41,906 --> 01:24:44,742
Yes, sir. This bird's full of vitamins.

949
01:24:47,328 --> 01:24:49,194
Oh, dear!

950
01:24:50,748 --> 01:24:53,948
- Have any more birds before him?
- Stacks. Animals an' all.

951
01:24:54,042 --> 01:24:58,911
A young fox cub once.
Reared it and let it go. A little blinder!

952
01:24:59,005 --> 01:25:02,331
I've had magpies, jackdaws.
Had a young jay once.

953
01:25:04,552 --> 01:25:08,379
- He's your favourite, though.
- Others weren't int' same street.

954
01:25:08,472 --> 01:25:10,964
Come on, then. Come on.

955
01:25:17,272 --> 01:25:19,764
- Come on, sir.
- Oh, dear me!

956
01:25:22,693 --> 01:25:25,603
- Watch that mattress, sir. It's slippy.
- OK.

957
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:36,571
Look what's left, sir.

958
01:25:37,707 --> 01:25:40,825
Only t'sparrow's leg.
Must have been hungry.

959
01:25:40,919 --> 01:25:43,368
Must have been starvin'.

960
01:25:43,462 --> 01:25:46,372
You hang on here. I'll put him ont' perch.

961
01:25:49,259 --> 01:25:51,125
Come on, then.

962
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:08,130
You know, there's something
weird about it when it's flyin'.

963
01:26:09,069 --> 01:26:13,198
- Hawks are t'best fliers there is.
- No, I didn't mean that.

964
01:26:13,281 --> 01:26:17,493
When it's flyin', there's something
about it makes you feel strange.

965
01:26:17,577 --> 01:26:21,195
- ls it cos everythin' goes quiet?
- That's it, aye.

966
01:26:21,288 --> 01:26:25,824
Other folks have noticed that. I know
a farmer who says it's same wi' owls.

967
01:26:25,918 --> 01:26:29,859
You know, when they get
his mice in his yard at night.

968
01:26:29,963 --> 01:26:33,664
When they swoop down, he feels like
pokin' his ears to make 'em pop.

969
01:26:33,758 --> 01:26:36,375
Cos it goes that quiet.

970
01:26:36,469 --> 01:26:39,712
It's as if they're flying
in a pocket of silence.

971
01:26:39,806 --> 01:26:42,339
Have you noticed
how quietly we're speaking?

972
01:26:42,433 --> 01:26:47,177
As if we're frightened to raise our voices,
a bit like shouting in church.

973
01:26:47,271 --> 01:26:50,430
- It's cos they're nervous.
- Oh, no. It's more than that.

974
01:26:50,524 --> 01:26:54,016
It's instinctive. It's a sort of respect.

975
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:58,771
I know, sir. That's what makes me mad.
When I take her for walks, somebody says

976
01:26:58,865 --> 01:27:02,023
"Look, it's Billy Casper and his pet hawk."

977
01:27:02,117 --> 01:27:04,902
I could shout at 'em, sir. lt in't a pet.

978
01:27:04,995 --> 01:27:08,405
Or if somebody comes up to me
and says "ls it tame?"

979
01:27:08,499 --> 01:27:12,408
ls it heck tame! Hawks can't be tamed.

980
01:27:12,502 --> 01:27:17,371
They're manned. It's wild and it's fierce
and it's not bothered about anybody.

981
01:27:17,464 --> 01:27:21,406
Not bothered about me, right.
That's what makes it great.

982
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:25,212
A lot of people wouldn't understand.
They like their pets to be fussed.

983
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:29,466
I'm not bothered about that.
I just want her for her looks and to fly her.

984
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:33,136
They can keep their talkin' budgies.
They're nowt compared wi' her.

985
01:27:34,021 --> 01:27:36,587
You're right, Billy. You're probably right.

986
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:42,602
D'you know summat, sir? I think she's
done me a favour, lettin' me watch her.

987
01:27:51,037 --> 01:27:53,738
"Same price, 7-1,
number 12, Doorkeeper."

988
01:27:53,832 --> 01:27:56,740
What's he studyin' there?

989
01:28:01,881 --> 01:28:04,445
- Can I help you, son?
- No, thanks.

990
01:28:06,968 --> 01:28:09,585
Hey, mister, can you
tell me t'prices of these?

991
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:11,754
What are they?

992
01:28:12,557 --> 01:28:14,423
Crackpot.

993
01:28:15,267 --> 01:28:17,342
Crackpot. 100-6.

994
01:28:18,604 --> 01:28:22,545
Tell Him He's Dead.
I've just been lookin' for this one meself.

995
01:28:23,441 --> 01:28:26,142
Tell Him He's Dead.
Second favourite, 4-1 .

996
01:28:26,236 --> 01:28:28,310
100-6, 4-1 .

997
01:28:29,072 --> 01:28:31,397
Would you back 'em?

998
01:28:31,491 --> 01:28:35,735
Tell Him He's Dead's a good horse.
Best horse int' race. Top weight.

999
01:28:35,828 --> 01:28:38,237
Don't fancy that one, though.

1000
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:42,407
No form. Hasn't even got a jockey on
here. No, shouldn't bother with that one.

1001
01:28:42,501 --> 01:28:44,742
D'yer think they'll win, then?

1002
01:28:44,836 --> 01:28:47,673
- How've you got them? Doubled?
- They're our Jud's.

1003
01:28:47,756 --> 01:28:51,885
Oh, he'll be all right if they do,
but I can't see it meself.

1004
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:53,834
Right. Ta.

1005
01:29:07,649 --> 01:29:11,809
- A bob's worth o' chips, and a fish.
- Serve him, will you, Mary?

1006
01:29:12,821 --> 01:29:15,729
- Yes, love? What do you want?
- Fish 'n' chips.

1007
01:29:17,658 --> 01:29:20,192
Stop kickin'. We only put that on today.

1008
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:25,061
- Got any scraps, missis?
- Yes, love. I'll put you some on.

1009
01:29:26,082 --> 01:29:31,285
Two shilling, love. I'm gettin' rid of
these chips, Floyd. It's gettin' late now.

1010
01:29:32,088 --> 01:29:34,371
Aye. But don't be goin' mad.

1011
01:29:34,465 --> 01:29:36,540
Sixpence change, love.

1012
01:29:42,055 --> 01:29:46,757
These kids. I don't know,
Mr Glover, they're just all the same.

1013
01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:53,816
- Can I have a quarter o' beef?
- By, those smell good.

1014
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:56,391
Can I have a quarter o' beef?

1015
01:29:58,653 --> 01:30:01,021
- Tha stilI got that bird, then?
- Yep.

1016
01:30:08,579 --> 01:30:11,144
- Here, you can have them for nowt.
- For nowt?

1017
01:30:11,248 --> 01:30:13,490
- They're only scraps.
- Another chip?

1018
01:30:13,584 --> 01:30:16,868
- No. I'm goin' for me dinner in a minute.
- Right, then. See yer.

1019
01:30:16,962 --> 01:30:18,829
See yer.

1020
01:30:47,365 --> 01:30:51,692
Usual difficulty
over concentration. Hm?

1021
01:30:53,871 --> 01:30:55,821
Three fives are 15, eh?

1022
01:30:55,915 --> 01:30:59,824
We write 15 one, five.
You write five, one.

1023
01:31:03,421 --> 01:31:06,622
Oi, tha fuckin' twat!

1024
01:31:07,717 --> 01:31:12,378
lsn't that that illustrious
brother of yours, Casper?

1025
01:31:12,471 --> 01:31:17,840
Shouldn't have thought he was the type to
have paid a visit to his old school again.

1026
01:31:19,019 --> 01:31:22,595
- What's the matter? Don't you feel well?
- No, sir.

1027
01:31:22,689 --> 01:31:26,682
- Do you want to go for a drink of water?
- No, sir.

1028
01:31:26,776 --> 01:31:30,060
- Well, open the window.
- I'm all right, sir.

1029
01:31:31,196 --> 01:31:33,021
Please yourself.

1030
01:31:35,701 --> 01:31:39,986
Right, now just pass your books forward,
will you? To the front.

1031
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,697
Front person on each row,
bring them to my desk, will you?

1032
01:32:02,558 --> 01:32:05,050
What's the matter, Casper?
Lost something?

1033
01:32:05,144 --> 01:32:07,709
- Me, sir? No, sir.
- On your way, then.

1034
01:32:37,298 --> 01:32:41,709
- What's up with thee, Jud?
- It's that little bastard, our Billy.

1035
01:32:41,803 --> 01:32:47,006
I left him with a bet for t'horses and he's
kept t'stinkin' money. I'll kill the little git!

1036
01:32:54,731 --> 01:32:57,348
- What are you playing at?
- Goin' to t'toilet, sir.

1037
01:32:57,442 --> 01:32:59,183
Hurry up, then.

1038
01:33:21,005 --> 01:33:23,122
- I'm on 'ere!
- Seen our Billy?

1039
01:33:23,215 --> 01:33:25,415
- Aye. He's here wi' me.
- Tryin' to be funny?

1040
01:33:25,509 --> 01:33:29,210
Cos I'll stick thi head down there,
old pal, and flush it.

1041
01:33:29,304 --> 01:33:32,255
- I asked if tha'd seen him.
- I wouldn't tell thee if I had.

1042
01:33:32,349 --> 01:33:34,966
- Look, I'm warnin' yer!
- Ow!

1043
01:35:32,208 --> 01:35:34,961
'Ey up, Tibbut, has tha seen our Jud?

1044
01:35:35,044 --> 01:35:37,953
- They've been lookin' all over for thee.
- Who has?

1045
01:35:38,047 --> 01:35:39,997
- Gryce Pudding.
- What for?

1046
01:35:40,091 --> 01:35:42,999
Youth Employment.
Tha should have gone for t'interview.

1047
01:35:43,093 --> 01:35:46,794
- Has tha seen our Jud?
- Yeah. He wanted to know where tha was.

1048
01:35:50,057 --> 01:35:52,623
- Where the devil have you been?
- Nowhere, sir.

1049
01:35:52,727 --> 01:35:54,927
Nowhere?
Who are you, the lnvisible Man?

1050
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:57,304
I felt sick, sir, so I went to t'toilets.

1051
01:35:57,398 --> 01:36:01,391
What happened? Did you drop down it?
I've had prefects looking for you!

1052
01:36:01,485 --> 01:36:04,769
- I went out for a breath of fresh air.
- Where are you going now?

1053
01:36:04,863 --> 01:36:08,773
- Employment officer.
- For your interview? Get off, then, lad!

1054
01:36:08,867 --> 01:36:10,941
And God help your future employer!

1055
01:37:02,332 --> 01:37:05,001
- Sit up, Peter.
- I'm sat up.

1056
01:37:06,127 --> 01:37:08,879
And don't be like a dummy
when you get in there.

1057
01:37:08,963 --> 01:37:13,008
Just tell him you're after a good job,
in an office or something like that.

1058
01:37:13,092 --> 01:37:15,657
I'm not working in no office!

1059
01:37:15,761 --> 01:37:20,463
- What are you after? A job on the bins?
- Can't you shut up?

1060
01:37:20,557 --> 01:37:22,382
- Sit up.
- I'm sat up.

1061
01:37:22,475 --> 01:37:25,676
- And straighten your tie.
- Tha's naggin'.

1062
01:37:26,521 --> 01:37:29,012
Somebody's got to nag.

1063
01:37:35,571 --> 01:37:37,645
ls it yer mam?

1064
01:37:38,323 --> 01:37:41,159
- What job are tha after?
- Owt'll do me.

1065
01:37:41,242 --> 01:37:43,276
- lt certainly won't.
- lt will.

1066
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:45,444
- lt won't.
- Right. Thank you.

1067
01:37:45,538 --> 01:37:47,738
Will you send the next one in?

1068
01:37:47,832 --> 01:37:50,949
- Pardon?
- Will you send the next one in, please?

1069
01:37:54,838 --> 01:37:57,674
- lsn't it your turn to go in?
- Suppose so.

1070
01:37:58,299 --> 01:38:00,375
Well, go on, then.

1071
01:38:17,151 --> 01:38:20,059
Get out! Knock and wait.

1072
01:38:24,866 --> 01:38:27,024
Come in.

1073
01:38:29,328 --> 01:38:31,893
Well, come in, lad, if you're coming.

1074
01:38:34,582 --> 01:38:37,534
- Sit down, Walker.
- I'm not Walker, sir.

1075
01:38:37,628 --> 01:38:40,953
Who are you, then? On my list
it should be Gerald Walker next.

1076
01:38:41,047 --> 01:38:43,539
Oliver, Stenton, then Walker.

1077
01:38:43,633 --> 01:38:45,958
- I'm Casper.
- Casper.

1078
01:38:46,052 --> 01:38:50,212
Oh, sit down, Casper. I should
have seen you earlier, shouldn't I?

1079
01:38:52,099 --> 01:38:55,716
Well, then, Casper,
what kind of job had you got in mind?

1080
01:38:59,647 --> 01:39:01,389
Well?

1081
01:39:01,482 --> 01:39:04,047
I don't know, sir.
I haven't thought about it.

1082
01:39:04,151 --> 01:39:08,436
You should be thinking about it. You want
to start off on the right foot, don't you?

1083
01:39:12,993 --> 01:39:15,558
Right, then.
Would you like to work in an office?

1084
01:39:15,663 --> 01:39:19,823
- Or would you prefer manual work?
- What's manual work?

1085
01:39:19,915 --> 01:39:24,075
lt means working with your hands. Things
like farming, engineering, plumbing.

1086
01:39:24,169 --> 01:39:27,788
Things like that,
as opposed to penpushing jobs.

1087
01:39:27,882 --> 01:39:31,823
l'd be all right in an office.
I have a job to read and write.

1088
01:39:34,763 --> 01:39:36,629
"Manual".

1089
01:39:38,016 --> 01:39:43,552
Tell me, Casper, have you ever thought
about entering a trade as an apprentice?

1090
01:39:43,646 --> 01:39:47,692
You know, as an electrician
or a bricklayer or something like that.

1091
01:39:47,775 --> 01:39:52,769
Of course, the money's not too good
while you're serving your apprenticeship,

1092
01:39:52,863 --> 01:39:56,856
but you'll always have a trade
at your fingertips, won't you?

1093
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:59,275
Well, what do you think about it?

1094
01:39:59,369 --> 01:40:04,154
As you've said, you feel better working
with your hands. Perhaps this is the best.

1095
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:09,243
Of course, you'd have to go to technical
college and study for examinations.

1096
01:40:09,337 --> 01:40:12,996
Some lads do it. Some do it for years,
two or three nights a week,

1097
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:16,082
right from leaving school
right up to mid-twenties,

1098
01:40:16,176 --> 01:40:19,794
when they take their Higher National,
or even degrees.

1099
01:40:20,889 --> 01:40:23,380
I say, lad. Are you listening to me?

1100
01:40:23,474 --> 01:40:25,925
- Yeah.
- You don't look as though you are.

1101
01:40:26,017 --> 01:40:29,636
I've other lads to see
before four o'clock, you know.

1102
01:40:30,689 --> 01:40:32,889
lf nothing I've mentioned appeals to you,

1103
01:40:32,983 --> 01:40:36,475
and if you can stand a hard day's work
and don't mind getting dirty,

1104
01:40:36,569 --> 01:40:40,145
- there are good opportunities in mining.
- I'm not goin' down t'pit.

1105
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:44,733
Don't be put off by what you've heard.
Conditions have improved tremendously.

1106
01:40:44,827 --> 01:40:47,443
I wouldn't be seen dead down t'pit.

1107
01:40:47,537 --> 01:40:50,572
What about hobbies?
What hobbies have you got?

1108
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:55,659
Do you like gardening, or constructing
Meccano sets, or anything like that?

1109
01:40:56,587 --> 01:40:59,663
- Don't you have any hobbies at all?
- Can I go now?

1110
01:40:59,757 --> 01:41:03,917
What's wrong with you, lad?
Sit down. Sit down, I haven't finished yet.

1111
01:41:05,512 --> 01:41:09,047
I've met some lads in my time,
but I've never met one like you.

1112
01:41:09,141 --> 01:41:13,843
Half the time you're like a cat on hot
bricks, the other half you're not listening.

1113
01:41:13,937 --> 01:41:15,844
Here. Take this form.

1114
01:41:15,938 --> 01:41:19,307
lt gives you information about
leaving school and starting work.

1115
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:23,394
Things like pensions, superannuation,
national insurance, wages.

1116
01:41:23,487 --> 01:41:27,700
At the back, there's a detachable form.
When you want your cards, fill it in...

1117
01:41:27,783 --> 01:41:29,899
Come back, lad. I haven't finished yet.

1118
01:41:29,993 --> 01:41:33,235
When you want your cards,
fill in that form, send it in. Got that?

1119
01:41:33,329 --> 01:41:35,822
- Yeah.
- Don't forget. And listen, Casper.

1120
01:41:35,916 --> 01:41:38,991
lf you do have trouble getting fixed up,
come in and see me.

1121
01:41:39,085 --> 01:41:41,243
- Yeah.
- Send the next boy in.

1122
01:42:01,229 --> 01:42:03,180
Kes!

1123
01:42:06,776 --> 01:42:08,643
Kes!

1124
01:42:10,488 --> 01:42:12,355
Kes!

1125
01:42:17,953 --> 01:42:19,820
Kes!

1126
01:42:22,207 --> 01:42:24,074
Kes!

1127
01:42:34,552 --> 01:42:36,418
Jud?

1128
01:42:38,180 --> 01:42:40,672
Jud?! Mother?!

1129
01:42:44,478 --> 01:42:47,595
- Missis, have you seen our Jud?
- I haven't, love. Sorry.

1130
01:42:53,945 --> 01:42:56,353
- Have you seen our Jud?
- Course I've seen him.

1131
01:42:56,447 --> 01:42:59,814
- Doesn't look as though you've seen him.
- You've seen him, then?

1132
01:42:59,908 --> 01:43:05,069
Course I've seen him. Come in here
playin' hell. Goin' to pull t'counter down.

1133
01:43:05,163 --> 01:43:08,239
I had to fetch Eric Clough
to prove tha hadn't put t'bet on.

1134
01:43:08,333 --> 01:43:11,366
- They won, then, did they?
- Both of 'em. 100-6 and 4-1 .

1135
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:15,162
- He'd have won a tenner, I tell thee that.
- Bloody hell.

1136
01:43:15,256 --> 01:43:17,122
Kes!

1137
01:43:20,635 --> 01:43:22,711
Come on, Kes!

1138
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:25,505
Come on, lass!

1139
01:43:38,068 --> 01:43:39,935
Kes!

1140
01:43:42,906 --> 01:43:44,772
Kes!

1141
01:44:05,259 --> 01:44:07,335
Come on, Kes!

1142
01:44:51,510 --> 01:44:53,377
Kes!

1143
01:45:08,401 --> 01:45:10,267
Kes!

1144
01:45:37,344 --> 01:45:41,879
- Where is it? What's tha done wi' it?
- Where've you been? Your tea's cold.

1145
01:45:41,973 --> 01:45:44,464
I said, where is it?

1146
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:49,010
- What's tha starin' at?
- Thee, tha little pig!

1147
01:45:49,104 --> 01:45:51,013
Don't call me a little pig!

1148
01:45:51,107 --> 01:45:53,942
Hey! Hey!

1149
01:45:54,026 --> 01:45:56,778
Jud, what's all t'bloody
pushin' and shovin'?

1150
01:45:56,861 --> 01:46:00,729
- Ask him. He knows.
- Tha'd have known if l'd got hold o' thee.

1151
01:46:00,823 --> 01:46:02,732
- Oh, get lost!
- Knows what?

1152
01:46:02,825 --> 01:46:05,317
What's goin' off? What's up wi' him?

1153
01:46:05,411 --> 01:46:08,945
lf he'd have put that bet on,
there wouldn't have been none of this.

1154
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:11,709
- He's put it on, hasn't he?
- Has he bloody hell!

1155
01:46:11,792 --> 01:46:15,869
- I told him to. I asked you not to forget.
- He didn't forget. He spent t'money!

1156
01:46:15,963 --> 01:46:17,536
How d'you know?

1157
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:20,582
What you gettin' so upset for?
Have they won?

1158
01:46:20,675 --> 01:46:25,044
Have they won?! l'd have 16 quid
if he'd kept his thieving hands to hisself.

1159
01:46:25,138 --> 01:46:27,973
- Look what you've done.
- Should have done it thissen.

1160
01:46:28,057 --> 01:46:31,299
- I could have a week off work for that!
- Get lost, you big pig!

1161
01:46:31,393 --> 01:46:33,801
Hey! Well, what's he upset for?

1162
01:46:33,895 --> 01:46:36,971
Because he's killed me hawk instead,
that's why.

1163
01:46:37,065 --> 01:46:40,767
- He never has.
- I know he has. Cos he couldn't catch me.

1164
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:46,062
- Jud! You have not killed this kid's hawk!
- So I have. What yer gonna do about it?

1165
01:46:46,156 --> 01:46:48,231
Killing yerself, that's what you want!

1166
01:46:48,325 --> 01:46:51,234
