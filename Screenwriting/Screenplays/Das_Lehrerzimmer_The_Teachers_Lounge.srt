Yes, I understand.
As I said, we had this last week...
Uh... One second.
Yes, I'm still here.
0153...
... 4. Yes.
Yes, we'll keep in touch.
I've made a note of everything and I'll take care of it.
Great. Talk soon.
- Hello, Ms. Nowak.
- Hi.
- Sorry for the delay.
- No problem.
Mr. Liebenwerda has outlined the topic.
Good. So you know what's going on?
Yes, but as I said, we don't know anything.
It's not about what you know, but about clues.
Have you noticed anything recently?
Are classmates behaving conspicuously?
I know the situation is unpleasant.
Not just for you.
But put yourselves in the shoes of the victims.
We must put an end to this together.
Class representatives bear responsibility.
What can we say? We know nothing.
Lukas?
Can't you think of anyone?
Does anyone have a new cell phone?
Or branded clothes? Bragging about money?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Hey.
You don't  have to either.
That's right.
We don't have to talk at all.
Look.
I go down the list of names with the pen and all you have to do is nod if you have a clue.
Yes?
Liebenwerda?
You don't have to, of course, if you don't want to.
Yes?
But let me continue.
We're almost through.
This one?
Here?
Great. Thank you, Lukas.
Okay.
A reminder: What is discussed here remains between us.
- Yes?
- Okay.
- Yes?
- Yes.
People.
Good day, Good day...
I see all the books.
I see all the folders and notebooks.
Great. Please get your homework out, I'm coming around.
And in the meantime, please watch the warm-up. And stay quiet.
Good.
Yes, good.
Ali...
Take another close look at number 2.
Phileas, will you explain it to him?
You have to expand to get to the same denominator.
I see!
Hey!
Okay.
Who would like to solve the warm-up?
Is 0.9 repeating the same number as 1?
- Hatice, yes?
- Actually, it's not the same number.
Actually?
Then please come to the blackboard and show us why. if you subtract 0.9 repeating from 1, then a remainder is left over.
0.00... lots of zeros and then 1 .
So you believe that there is still a number between 0.9 repeating and 1 ?
Yes.
What do you think? Is this proof or an assertion?
Okay. Oskar would like to try.
Thank you, Hatice.
Nerd alert!
So, 0.1 repeating... is equal to one ninth.
And 9 times one ninth equals 1.
So 0.9 repeating is the same as 1 .
- What do you think?
- I don't get it.
There must be a gap between 0.9 and 1 .
Thank you, Oskar.
Does anyone else not understand it?
Well, the task was a little more demanding.
But the most important thing you need to understand is that a proof needs a derivation.
Step by step.
We'll get there. Yes, please?
Excuse me. I'll take over for a moment, okay?
Hello everyone, we have to interrupt the lesson for a moment.
- Mr. Dudek?
- All girls please stand up.
- Why?
- Stand up.
- Just get up.
- And now?
And now please leave the room.
Come on, get out.
Wait outside.
Yes?
We'll get you in a minute.
Don't run away.
Close the door.
Good. Everyone who is still here is listening carefully.
We would like to look into your wallets.
Please put them on the table and come forward.
- Do we have to do that?
- It's voluntary, of course.
But if you have nothing to hide, you don't have to worry.
Take out your wallet and come to the front.
What is this all about?
Were you not present during the survey?
Who is sitting here?
Oskar.
Oskar, where's your wallet?
- I don't have one.
- You don't have to show it, Oskar.
- I said I didn't have one.
- And this one?
Friends, whose seat is this?
Ms. Nowak?
That's Ali's seat.
Ali, please come with me.
Come on.
I gave him money in the morning to buy a present, for his cousin.
What kind of present?
For a computer game.
Right?
Yes, for a computer game.
Ali, Mrs. and Mr. Yilmaz,
I think we have clarity now and can dismiss the matter.
What made you think of him?
- Excuse me?
- Why my Ali?
- He had a lot of money with him.
- So what?
What if I like to give my child money?
Yes.
- Mrs. Yilmaz...
- Carrying money is not a criminal offense.
That's right.
We have what's called a zero-tolerance policy at the school.
In short, this means that we investigate everything.
But what do the others think now?
You know what children are like.
Don't worry.
We'll put it right.
- Right?
- Yes.
We can be glad that the suspicion was unfounded.
Otherwise there would be a big problem.
We're sorry that you had to come.
Yes, we are sorry.
I would ask you to please speak German.
German? Okay, then
I'll speak German.
My son does not steal. Never.
Because if he did,
I'd break his legs.
Ms. Nowak, the new substitution plan is in your locker.
- Mrs. Holbach is ill.
- I know. Thank you, Ms. Kuhn.
... Nobody was frisked.
It was voluntary.
None of it was voluntary. You know that.
It would have been nice to at least let me know.
Why are you on first name terms?
I understand your indignation, but you don't know how long this has been going on.
Unfortunately, there are people at school who steal whatever they can get their hands on for no reason.
We should seize the opportunity and act.
Have the pencils reappeared?
- No.
- That's something like 1,000 pencils now.
Who needs 1,000 pencils?
Hasn't this started since the new company started cleaning here?
Vanessa, they're really nice.
What about a private investigator?
Then a guy with a pipe sits in the schoolyard and convicts thieves?
- Just like in retail.
- I'll carry on.
"Act," isn't that right,
Mr. Liebenwerda?
Hands on your knees! One, two!
On three we raise our arms and legs.
- Together?
- Yes.
One, two, three.
And those who can are welcome to move around.
Come on,
Enno!
Nicely dribbled.
All good with you?
Great, Vera!
Pass. Yes! Very good.
Very good, Vera!
Hey! Hey, guys!
Good sportsmanship!
Ali, up. This is what happens.
I can't stand it anymore.
Luise and Jieun do what they want.
Where are they anyway?
Calm down and keep playing, okay?
Not so bad. Let's move on.
Jenny, will you check on
Jieun and Luise please?
But we can't play like that.
Great, Lukas.
Ruben, come here.
Can you be the ref? I'll be right back.
Jieun?
Luise?
- Are you coming back in?
- We were just getting some fresh air.
Luise, what are you hiding between your legs?
- Nothing.
- Come on, show me.
- Have you been smoking?
- No, we haven't.
- Why the lighter?
- Um... To heat up the heroin.
- That's not funny.
- I think it is.
I thought you weren't feeling well.
- We were just catching our breath.
- That's right.
Okay. Everyone back inside.
What about my lighter?
That stays with me for the time being.
- For how long?
Until I speak to your parents.
Please don't do that.
Fine by me. But sign out when you leave the room in future, okay?
- And the lighter?
- Got it?
- Yes, Mrs. Nowak.
- Yes.
Good.
You'll get the lighter at the end of the day.
Now in with you.
Hey, Oskar.
Hello.
This was in the gym.
It doesn't belong to my students.
Diary of someone named Steffi.
Unfortunately no surname.
Diary? Have you read it yet?
- I would never do that.
- Honestly? Me neither.
I'm still having problems with my email account.
- Could IT reset my password?
- Ms. Kuhn?
Fear not. Yes?
I need some tampons.
T or B?
- T please.
- And you?
- I'm good.
- How many?
- Two.
Thank you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Ms. Kuhn?
- Yes?
- The password?
- I'm afraid I can't, unfortunately.
- Why not?
- Because Mariam has already done it.
- Ah!
- It's in your drawer.
You're great! Thank you.
- What?
- "You're great."
Are you ready yet?
Do you want to check the answers again?
Can I go outside?
But stay quiet.
- Tom.
- That's not mine.
That's your handwriting.
- Give me the test.
- No.
Give it to me.
- No.
He said it wasn't his.
Ali, quiet!
Give it to me, come on.
No.
Tom.
Please continue.
Here.
Start again.
You have 20 minutes left.
- What should I do with it?
- Do it again. Otherwise it's a 6.
- The note isn't mine.
- Tom, it's not a discussion.
Please come to the front and turn in your tests.
Thank you.
Tom, please stay here for a moment.
I'll wait outside.
So, Tom.
Your behavior was not okay.
What did I do?
You lied and talked back.
That distracted your classmates.
I looked at the cheat sheet.
If you take the trouble to make one, at least write the right answers on it.
You copied your own errors one-to-one onto the test.
And that wasn't your note?
Do you want me to lie to you?
Surely not, right?
Tom.
What can I say to that?
I want you to understand that your behavior is not fair.
Rules are for everyone, you know?
- Do you understand that, Tom?
- I do. I'm not stupid.
Anything else you want to tell me?
- Sorry?
- "Sorry."
Sorry is what you want to hear, isn't it?
Can I go?
Yes, you can go.
We will let the parents know.
All right, that's great.
When do you think you'll have the list of participants?
I hope to have it by the end of next month, is that good for you?
Morning, Carla.
- One question.
- Hello.
- You're in here already?
- Just a second.
- Yes
- Sorry,
I wanted to ask if we could talk briefly about a student later?
Um, sure.
- It's about Ali.
- Again?
It was already close last semester.
If he carries on like this, he won't pass this year.
- Hey.
- Good morning.
- We're talking about Ali, Thomas.
- Oh yes, difficult.
Why difficult?
Just difficult.
I would say at risk of transfer.
- Absolutely.
- Wait a minute. Uh, Tim?
We're going to have to catch up some other time, I'm sorry.
Okay.
- Okay. 
- Enough done for the moment.
- Is it about Ali's exams?
- Also that, yes.
- Also?
- Sorry.
Bye, Tim.
The semester has only just begun. Um...
Have you spoken to the parents?
- Not yet.
- Do you know what they do for a living?
- The father drives a cab, I think.
- What does that matter?
Perhaps he lacks someone at home to support him.
- Oh, did you believe them?
- The parents?
Yes.
Is this about Ali's exams or the thefts?
The thefts are just nonsense, that doesn't matter at all.
Exactly. But to your question,
Vanessa: Yes, I believe them.
I believe they have integrity and Ali doesn't steal.
It was a question,
Carla, just a simple question, okay?
All right, Vanessa.
Yes, they're all too miffed for me here.
Thank you very much, Carla.
Then we can all go back to our work.
- Hey Carla.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I wanted to apologize.
- What do you mean?
The search of your class was not in order.
That's okay. I'm over it.
And do me a favor:
Let's speak German at work.
- Why? Are you ashamed?
- I'm not.
I think it's better for our colleagues.
Fine, whatever.
Thank you.
Ms. Kuhn, the printers are on strike again.
Striking again? We'll probably have to talk to the works council.
Paper jam.
Have you tried the flap on the right?
It's usually stuck there.
It's quick with you.
We'll take care of it when we get the chance.
Thank you, Ms. Kuhn.
He wants us to do it for him.
Ms. Nowak.
- What can we do for you?
- Um...
You know, Ms. Kuhn,
I have a huge problem.
Yes, and how can we help?
So...
How do I express this elegantly? Hm...
Excuse me, can I have a word with Ms. Kuhn in private?
Yeah, sure. Shall I go out?
Mariam, why don't you look at the printer.
Apparently a degree in physics is not enough to solve the problem.
- Do you want to sit down?
- No thanks.
So, Ms. Kuhn, I was in gym class and my jacket was hanging in the staff room.
I see.
- What about the jacket?
- The jacket is still there.
So what's the problem?
In the jacket was my wallet and in the wallet was...
... Money?
- Money, right. Yes.
Uh, was.
You mean someone from the staff?
Why do you assume it was the staff?
If the jacket was hanging in the staff room, pupils are out of the question.
Come in!
Ah, good.
So who was there?
Thank you!
Liebenwerda was there,
Mrs. Semnik... Unfortunately,
I wasn't there the whole time.
- Mariam, of course...
- Liebenwerda, Semnik, Mrs. Irfan.
Do you think one of them would do that?
Ms. Kuhn.
Do you have something to tell me?
What?
Your blouse... I've never seen it before.
My blouse? What about my blouse?
Ms. Kuhn, this is very unpleasant for me, but there are clear indications that it was you.
That what was me?
This is a joke.
I don't want this to make waves.
Give the money back, promise that this will stop and we'll forget about it, okay?
Are you actually serious? Really?
See it as an opportunity to get the matter off the table.
As an opportunity? The impudence!
Please leave now.
Please leave now.
Get out!
Uh, can I go back in?
Can I show you something?
Ms. Kuhn, please follow me to my office.
- Have you eaten?
- Let's do it together. Wait for me.
Hurry up. I'm hungry.
Take a seat.
Ms. Kuhn, I'm sure you can guess what this is all about.
Would you like to tell us something?
This insinuation is an absolute joke.
Fine, but we have a problem and we need to talk about it.
That is not an insinuation.
Well, yes.
Because... do you have proof?
Give me that.
Ms. Nowak.
Ms. Kuhn, I can't believe what I'm seeing.
That's your proof? You can't recognize anyone.
But the blouse?
Yes?
If I'm not mistaken, that's the blouse you're wearing right now.
And you've checked that none of the 70 people who come and go here are wearing the same blouse?
50 percent of them are men, they don't wear them, and the rest are in class or sick.
If there is no joint solution now,
I will unfortunately have to report it.
- What kind of solution?
- A joint solution.
A start would be for Ms. Nowak to get her money back.
So...
So you have already made your judgment.
Here you go.
Well!
There! Why don't you take it?
Oh!
Well, as luck would have it,
I have to go to the bank because I don't have any money.
Or is there something else here that belongs to you?
Please, take it.
Or do you want to frisk me?
Here!
That's part of the agenda here now.
- Is everything okay?
- Hold on.
- What's going on?
- Ms. Kuhn?
- Nothing.
- Tell me something!
- Come.
- Ms. Kuhn, please let's talk.
Mom, where are we going?
Ms. Kuhn, please stop for a moment.
Tell me what's going on.
Come.
- Let go of me!
- Now!
Come! Please come now.
... I'll tell you later.
Can we talk privately?
You can speak freely in front of Mr. Dudek.
- I think we've made a big mistake.
- Oh?
Strictly speaking, the video is not clear evidence.
It's too late to take it back now.
There's another problem, Carla.
Your video violates personal rights.
Not just those of Ms. Kuhn, but of all colleagues.
Shit.
- We shouldn't have shown her the video.
- No crying over spilt milk.
What now?
I call our lawyers, who will advise us to give the video to the police,
Police? Is that necessary?
... to file a complaint against unknown persons.
Until then, let's agree on a language, a wording, shall we?
And forbid ourselves accusations, suspicions and prejudices.
Understood. I'll work on it.
Got it?
What about Oskar?
Luise, not bad.
Well done.
- Ruby.
- Thank you very much.
- And Ela. You studied together?
- Yes.
Tom.
You still have to do better.
- Ali, much better.
- Cool, a 3!
- Phileas.
- I got a 3!
What was going on there?
You usually manage a 3 too.
Congratulations to you.
Very good, Oskar.
Really good.
- Vera, also good.
- Yes!
Ruben.
Not bad.
So I'm happy.
What have you got?
Guys! Hey!
I've emailed your parents about the deposit for the England exchange.
Did you remember them?
Yes.
Good. Josephine?
Could you write the grade sheet on the blackboard?
- Yes!
- Please.
No! For what?
Who wants to see the grade sheet on the blackboard?
Which one of you...
Who does not want to see the grade sheet on the blackboard?
Hey!
Josefine, why is this important to you?
I would like to know where I stand.
You are sitting on a chair.
Tom.
- What if you have the worst grade?
- Too bad, you should have studied.
Yes, what if you get a bad grade?
And everyone wants to see it on the blackboard?
Ruby?
Well, that won't matter for long.
In 1 or 2 weeks, you'll forget who has a 1 and who has a 6.
If it doesn't matter,
I won't write it on there.
Hey!
We'll carry on and I won't write the grades on the board.
If you...
If you want to know where you stand, come and see me after the lesson.
Please raise your chairs.
Thank you.
Ms. Nowak, I need the class register.
Thank you.
- Here you go.
- Bye.
Are you waiting for something, Oskar?
You should be proud of your great work.
Here, take a look.
I wanted to show this to you.
Do you know what that is?
This is a Rubik's cube.
It has nothing to do with magic, but with math.
There are algorithms with which you can solve the cube immediately.
Do you know what an algorithm is?
It's a clear sequence of actions to solve a problem.
Look.
Do you want to try it?
If you want, I can lend it to you.
What do I have to do?
You have to turn until all sides are one color.
It will only get harder.
Keep it until you've solved it.
And if something is bothering you, you can talk to me.
Or with Mrs. Semnik, the guidance counselor.
Why did mom cry yesterday?
Didn't you talk about it?
I see.
Did you have a fight with her?
Hello, Oskar. Come in.
Sit down.
Hello Oskar.
We wanted to talk to your mom, but she's not answering.
Would you like a sweet?
She slept this morning and didn't want to talk.
Could you call her on your cell phone?
What should I say?
That we want to talk to her.
Hello, mom, I'm in Dr. Böhm's office.
She wants to talk to you.
Yes.
Okay. Yes, mom. Bye.
So? What did she say?
That she... she doesn't want to talk to you. And...
And?
That you should not interfere.
What did mom do wrong?
Better to discuss this with your mother.
No, why? Just say it.
All right, you're already grown up and you'll find out in the end anyway.
Your mom will no longer be working for the time being.
I say "for the time being" because we first have to find out what happened.
And what happened?
Well, that still needs to be found out.
I want to know now.
I can't tell you any more at the moment.
Is it about the thefts?
What makes you think that?
That's not what we're talking about.
You're keeping things from me and saying mom doesn't work here anymore.
It wasn't her.
Nobody said that.
Nobody is accusing your mom.
But tell her we need to talk to her.
Oskar, come on, let's go outside.
- That was so unnecessary.
- Yes, that was unnecessary.
I thought we were keeping quiet?
Language, regulation, wording, those were your words.
Firstly, I didn't say anything he didn't already know.
Secondly, you brought him here!
But not to make vague allusions!
- We wanted to avoid that.
- Trust my many years of experience.
Experience? Can't you see how confused he is?
The boy is crystal clear.
He can add 1 +1 together.
We are the ones who are confused.
The children are great. They are friendly.
They help each other.
Overall, it is a very cooperative class.
Of course, there's still room for improvement...
All right. Ciao.
- Um...
- Hello.
Hello, uh, Nauhaus, I'm Tom's father.
- Ah yes, why don't you take a seat?
- Yes.
Um, I was just about to describe my impressions.
It is very important that the children develop a sense of initiative. Um...
Here is information about the school trip.
- It's also been emailed.
- Thank you.
Jieun said the math test was bad?
Unfortunately, that's true.
Then it's not just the children who have failed, is it?
I wouldn't say it that way.
"Failure" is too strong.
I also hardly understand the material.
A black box for me too, quite honestly.
These are not tasks for twelve-year-olds.
It's 7th grade material.
I stick to the curriculum.
Ms. Nowak, I also have a topic for discussion.
Yes, please.
Jenny told me that there was an interrogation.
And that she was coerced into revealing information about classmates.
I don't know if everyone is aware.
It was also a topic in the parents' WhatsApp group.
Perhaps you could say something about that?
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
So, nobody was coerced.
We sought a conversation with the class representatives, um...
And asked them to help in this matter.
It seems to me as if the children were being coerced, and were being incited to denounce others.
Here, too, I find the choice of words very drastic.
We asked the children for help.
You made them snitch on classmates and keep quiet about it.
You must know that this creates immense psychological pressure.
Confidentiality should allow children to speak freely about pressure, within a protected space.
I would be happy to talk to you after the meeting...
But this is everyone's business.
Come in.
Everyone should hear...
Ms. Kuhn.
Carry on.
Uh, okay.
Um...
Where were we?
What happened to Ali?
I didn't notice.
There was one procedure that I didn't think was okay either, but I can assure you, that we have the problem under control.
What does "under control" mean?
We can speak more in a separate conversation.
Why don't you tell the rest of the story?
What rest of the story?
Hmm?
The parents have a right to know what happened.
This is not the right time...
The parents have a right to know that their children's teacher will end up in court.
Ms. Kuhn, that is inappropriate.
That's it!
Do you want to know what happened?
Yes, of course!
This woman recorded videos.
Secretly. At school.
- What? Of whom?
- Of her colleagues, imagine that.
Spying. Denunciation.
Slander! Character assassination!
Everything that goes with it!
Entire livelihoods are being destroyed here simply on the basis of assumptions.
If I were you,
I wouldn't believe a word she says!
Shame on you.
Yes, shame on you.
Ms. Nowak, what is this?
Excuse me.
It was thought to be a sign of disaster, a punishment by divine powers.
But then came Thales of Miletus.
He was a mathematician and knew that a solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the sun and the earth.
There.
There is a partial, an annular and a total solar eclipse.
With the help of mathematical calculations,
Thales was able to accurately predict the next solar eclipse.
And the unpredictable became predictable.
Thank you. End of presentation.
Thank you, you can sit down.
What has it done to people, that the unpredictable has become predictable?
Jieun?
Um... did people no longer believe in God?
Thanks Lukas, you can pick up the phone from me later.
No longer believed in God.
There's something to that.
Through a new critical spirit,
Thales ushered in something like modern astronomy.
- You know astronomy, right?
- You mean like zodiac signs?
That's astrology.
That's something else.
Who knows what astronomy means?
- Something to do with star research?
- Exactly.
Astronomy is the science of celestial bodies.
The phenomena of the world were no longer explained by God or higher powers, but a universally verifiable truth was sought.
Modern science is based on this.
Yes, Lukas.
Would you please put my cell phone in your pocket so that no one steals it?
Your phone is safe in this class.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
- Okay, what do you mean by that?
- He means me. But it wasn't me.
That's right. That was clarified in the parents' meeting.
I don't mean Ali. We learned in biology that traits are hereditary.
Shut up!
I don't understand that.
Please explain.
For example, from mother to son.
If the mother is fat, the child will also be fat.
Shut up!
Shut up!
It's not quite that simple...
Hey.
It's not quite that simple, but you're obviously alluding to something else.
So can you please explain to me who inherits what from whom?
Doesn't matter now, does it?
- You have nothing to say about it?
- No, we are on...
- Coward!
- ...another topic.
Nothing more to say?
That was a poor thesis, Lukas.
Think first, then talk.
- I think so too.
- Such an idiot.
Hello?
- Hello, is this Mrs. Wizorek speaking?
- Yes.
This is Carla Nowak, Lukas' teacher.
Do you have time to talk?
I'm on my break, but
I'm glad you called.
What happened at the parents' meeting yesterday?
Too bad you couldn't make it.
In the parent chat, they said that you don't have the situation under control.
You don't want to know the rest.
Well, I was actually calling about Lukas.
We parents will be talking to the school administrators again.
I see. Then we should also talk about Lukas' behavior.
What about his behavior?
Uh, one second.
Oskar, you can't be here.
Ms. Nowak?
Do you want to sit down here?
Why is everyone so sure?
No one is sure. The whole thing is currently being checked.
And why isn't my mother working?
Officially, she is on vacation.
Is there any evidence?
- For what?
- For your accusation.
There is clear evidence, but we can't tell you anything about that.
- What kind of evidence?
- We're not allowed to tell you.
Can I be alone with Mrs. Nowak?
Why?
Okay. I'll wait outside.
What is that?
63 euros and 45 cents.
My savings. You can have that.
Did your mom tell you to give it to me?
- Oskar, it's not about money.
- Then what is it about?
It's about stealing.
It doesn't matter whether it's 1 cent or
100 euros. It's all about being honest.
Put the money back in the bag.
It wasn't my mom.
Yes, okay. I understand.
You should not only understand, but say it.
- Say what?
- Say it.
- Yes, what?
- That she's innocent.
Your mom is innocent,
Oskar. Satisfied?
Apologize publicly and straighten it out.
- Sorry, I can't do that.
- You should, because otherwise...
- Otherwise what?
- Otherwise you'll regret it.
- Are you threatening me right now?
- Maybe.
I don't want to hear that...
Then apologize publicly, otherwise you will see what will come out of it!
Hey! Carla, well?
- A piece of cake?
- Something to celebrate?
- It's my birthday.
- Happy birthday. Are you celebrating?
Nope, I have to make copies later, prepare the rooms for the parents' meeting, and I have to...
- Can I help?
Oh no, that's fine.
Say, the other day, that must have been quite a show.
- What do you mean?
- The parents' meeting.
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Good. These things happen.
- ...that you were born...
- Yummy, eh?
- What things happen?
- Ms. Kuhn.
Speaking of which, I will be taking legal action against Ms. Kuhn.
And supposedly there's a video?
Just because she stole from me doesn't mean she stole from you.
- It could have been someone else.
- That's right.
Did you make a video?
And... can we see that?
- Not at the moment, no.
- Stupid question, but why not?
It's evidence for the police.
- I can't show it around.
- Show it around?
I am also one of the victims,
I was also robbed, several times.
- And you refuse to help me?
- The one has nothing to do with the other.
You know, Carla, to be honest,
I feel uncomfortable that secret video recordings were made here. So...
- Who else is on the video?
- I guarantee you, you are not.
- I still don't think it's good.
- Okay, noted.
- Is there any cake left?
- Help yourself!
I understand that this is a bit much for you. Perhaps you are overwhelmed.
Not at all. It's all good.
But perhaps we can still take joint action against Ms. Kuhn.
The poor woman is already losing her job.
"The poor woman"? Seriously?
Doesn't look like fun.
We honor your compassion, but you also have a responsibility to us.
That's exactly why I can't help you any further, I'm sorry.
- Unbelievable.
- May I remind you, Mr. Liebenwerda, that you wanted to smuggle a private detective into the school?
- That was a joke!
- And there is a difference, Carla.
With the detective, everyone would have known.
What you did was behind our backs.
Excuse me, there are some students outside for you.
Hello Mrs. Nowak!
Hello folks. What can I do for you?
You wanted to give an interview to the school magazine.
We were supposed to meet on Tuesday, weren't we?
We have to go to print earlier because our room will be occupied.
Exactly.
It also only takes 15 minutes.
Do you want cake?
Let's go.
That's Paul, Daniel, Bine,
Krissi, Mitra, Flo.
The rest aren't important.
- Thank you for joining us.
- Sure.
Sit down.
Okay. What do you want to know?
Can we record the conversation?
It will be easier for us later.
Okay.
You've been at our school since the beginning of the semester.
How do you like it?
I feel comfortable and the students are all really nice.
The faculty is also great.
There are differences of opinion, but...
I was warmly welcomed into the school family.
What kind of differences of opinion?
What happens in the staff room stays in the staff room.
Next question:
Nowak, isn't that a Polish name?
That's true. But I was born in Westphalia and my parents came to Germany from near
Gdansk at the end of the 1960s.
Do you speak Polish?
"Curiosity killed the cat."
- What does that mean?
- That's part of your research.
Okay, um...
Do you have tattoos?
And if so, where?
I always wanted some, but was too cowardly. Fortunately.
Do you have a tip for your younger self?
How do I say this without sounding precocious?
The insecurities you have as a young person are completely normal.
I wish someone had told me back then that everything would be fine.
Or that everything is fine and that
I can listen to my gut feeling.
I have to interject here.
You said at the beginning that you feel comfortable at the school.
I just can't comprehend that.
I find the atmosphere at our school unpleasant.
- Okay. What do you think?
- It's no secret that people steal.
Do you know how it came about that students were suspected?
Those were false accusations.
You're right about that.
But something had to be done, also to protect those who had nothing to do with it.
I'm sorry that the wrong people were suspected.
That doesn't answer the question.
How did we come to be suspected?
There were clues, but they weren't helpful.
That didn't go well.
And Ms. Kuhn is no longer allowed to work here after 14 years?
- Wasn't it 15?
- Nope.
This is a matter for the school supervisory authority.
Was Ms. Kuhn suspended for stealing?
I can't comment on that.
- Was there secret video surveillance?
- I can't say anything about that either.
- You can't say or don't know?
- Are you not allowed to say?
I probably could, but I don't think it would be right.
- Is it not our students' business?
- Yes, of course it is.
- Yes.
- And?
- If there are no more questions...
- Should Oskar Kuhn change schools?
- Where did you get that from?
- Well.
- Who says so?
- Just the grapevine.
You understand that we must protect our sources.
Your sources?
Stop spreading rumors.
That's totally dubious.
We want to know what's going on at the school.
We're done. Or do you still have questions?
Nope.
Thank you, Ms. Nowak.
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
Will you send me the interview in advance?
- Sure.
- When?
When it's ready.
- Good.
- I need a photo of you. May I?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey Carla.
Hey Carla.
Impudence!
Get out!
Good day...
At least it's quiet.
Let's go through the homework.
Who will start?
- Ali, you wanted to say something?
- No, not at all.
If no one volunteers,
I'll have to ask you individually.
Jieun, have you done your homework?
Jieun!
Okay. Hatice? Maybe you?
Good. Then I'll sit down too and we'll keep quiet.
Stupid cow.
- Tell me what's going on!
- Is Oskar being taken out of school?
I have no idea where this rumor came from, but if anyone knows, it's Oskar himself.
Do you want to say something, Oskar?
Apparently not.
Let's get on with our homework.
First tell us what has happened and what will happen.
If you want to talk about this, bring it up in school council.
Right now we're doing our lessons.
- We have a right to know.
- Exactly.
- Nobody apologized to me.
- That's not true.
I apologized and so did Dr. Böhm.
In the office, remember?
- What about the video?
- There is no video, for God's sake.
Quiet now.
Give me the homework books.
- Give me that.
- You won't get mine.
- Lukas.
- Why do you start at the back?
- Give it to me.
- Why?
Lukas, give me that.
- Where's the homework?
- All because of him!
- Just do your homework.
- Quiet, I said!
So, who will come up to the board?
- No one.
- Yes, just that. No one.
Tom, very good.
Traitor.
Who was that?
- Who shouted "traitor"?
- Me.
That's not okay, Jieun.
- We should show solidarity.
- Exactly!
You can afford to do that with your grades. Otherwise I'd stay seated.
- Traitor.
- Jieun?
If you say that again,
I'll have to send you out.
The whole thing is because of him.
Leave Oskar alone and carry on.
- Because of his criminal mother.
- What?
- Because of his criminal mother.
- Out.
- I'm the only one taking part!
- Out!
By the way,
Ms. Nowak, we're only doing the stupid welcoming ceremony for you.
Exactly.
Totally bananas, you can do that in 1st grade.
Do you know how embarrassing this is?
I've already mentioned it.
The last few days and weeks were not okay.
Something has to change.
Can anyone imagine what I mean?
- Jonas?
- Are we still doing sports today?
We'll have sports once we have discussed a few things.
We can discuss this in the class council!
We have to treat each other differently.
That's why I want to do a few exercises today.
I need six volunteers for the first exercise.
Who's up for it?
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Super.
Please stand up.
For the first task, um... you stand on this crate.
But no one is allowed to fall off.
Give it a try.
Okay, those standing outside:
Do you have any suggestions on what could be done better? Thai?
Maybe hold on to your shoulders?
Try it out.
Is there another solution?
Oskar, surely you have an idea?
Say something.
Hmm?
We have to hold hands.
Okay.
Would you show us how you imagine it?
Can you swap with Lukas?
- Thanks, Lukas.
- Have fun, nerd.
Hey!
That looks good.
Will the four of you join us?
Crosswise, exactly.
Yes!
You have found the solution.
Oskar! Hey!
Break it up, go!
Tom! Tom!
Now calm down!
- Encore!
- Come on, wanker!
Oskar, listen to me!
Out, Oskar!
- Come on!
- Out!
Come in when you've calmed down.
That was an example of what I meant.
Ms. Nowak?
Are you crazy?
Ah!
Oskar!
Oskar!
Oskar, stand still!
Oskar!
Oskar! Stand still!
Give me the laptop.
The events surrounding
Oskar's mother create enormous psychological pressure.
And although he receives support from some of the class, he is bullied by others.
This leads to unrest and sometimes even refusal to work in class.
In addition, the student's frustration manifests itself in an increased willingness to use violence, which manifests itself physically.
I recommend that you consider changing classes first.
If the situation does not improve for the student, a change of school could also be considered.
A new start, but one that the mother would have to agree to.
Thank you. Ms. Nowak, as Oskar's teacher, it's your turn now.
I consider it a declaration of failure to send the student to another school.
But even in a different class he is still someone who has incited the class to boycott, beaten up his classmates smashed windows and stole a laptop.
- He didn't want to steal it.
- What?
- He wanted to protect his mother.
- If you say so.
That does not undo the rest.
You know we have a...
Zero-tolerance policy.
Yes, I know, Dr. Böhm.
But this is something personal between Oskar and me.
Apparently he sees me as responsible for the fact that his mother no longer works here.
I think it's a mistake to take a student out of his or her social context.
Punishing him for a possible offense committed by his mother is completely unfair.
I would like to make it clear: 
This is solely about Oskar's behavior.
Not about his mother.
But we're only discussing one perspective.
What do we do with the student to solve the problem?
The consequences are then borne by others.
That must not happen.
I agree.
Please?
I also think that the consequences would be borne by others.
Mostly us students.
And what do you suggest?
Since I'm partly to blame for this, it shouldn't be Oskar who goes...
- Then what?
- It should be me.
- Oh well.
- The school is already understaffed.
There are almost no substitutes left.
- We can close the class down.
- That's out of the question.
So, we have now listened to Ms.
Semnik's expert opinion, we have Ms. Nowak...
But we're deciding over Oskar.
We're pushing the problem away.
Firstly, we are not pushing the problem away, we are democratically seeking a solution.
Secondly, Oskar and his mother don't recognize their wrongdoings.
They had the opportunity to comment here.
But they have refused all communication.
If there are no more questions, we vote.
- I have one more question.
- Please.
- Ms. Nowak, what's wrong with your eye?
- I fell down, as I said.
- What?
- Fell down.
That's not difficult to understand.
Your commitment to Oskar is admirable.
Thomas, what's that got to do with it? Can we...
I just want to make sure that the boy doesn't hit any teachers.
Oskar doesn't hit anyone.
I suggest we take the vote now.
- Yes?
- Yes.
Does anyone have anything against us voting openly?
I would like to keep this anonymous.
All right, Ms. König would like it to be anonymous.
Then we will now vote on whether Oskar Kuhn should receive a 10-day suspension from lessons, and whether he is allowed to take part in the school trip to England.
If the situation does not improve after that, we will have to meet again and discuss stricter measures, such as a change of school.
Give me the slips of paper.
- Have a nice evening.
- Take care.
Somehow it's still crooked.
On the left perhaps...
Look. Nowak.
Are you ready to go?
Not until Monday.
But we're already making preparations.
- Do you want a copy? Two euros.
- Two euros?
A bit expensive for a school newspaper, isn't it?
We have expenses: printing, research, technology, milk and coffee all cost money.
Didn't you want to send me the text?
- That was Krissi's job.
- I got nothing.
Well, then you'll get an advance copy. For free.
- Are you serious?
- We only wrote what you said.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- You have to take the piece out.
- Why?
Because you twist statements and take them out of context.
Because this is something between Ms. Kuhn and me...
We see it differently.
- This is journalism.
It is not. A review of the text was promised.
We do not allow ourselves to be censored to make you look better.
- It's not about looking better.
- Isn't it?
And not about censorship, but about facts.
Which you denied us.
We shed light on the flip side.
- You talked to Ms. Kuhn?
- Well, what do you think?
Okay guys...
You're overshooting the mark.
This text is dubious!
- You're causing damage.
- We're bringing the truth.
- It's your problem if you can't stand it.
- You see.
TRUTH OVERCOMES
ALL BORDERS
Everything else is PR.
Do you want to talk?
Will you give me a hug?
Hello, Mrs. Nowak!
Where can you get a better deal?
Get the best information!
One euro for you!
Grab it!
Teachers pay more...
- Why does she never come to us when something is wrong?
Team spirit...
- Morning, Ms. Nowak.
- Morning.
- I wonder how you're doing today.
- Oh yeah?
Morning, Carla.
- Morning.
"Ideally, school is a protected space for children and young people. Not for us."
"In the investigation of thefts, stuednts were expected to do things that they had only known from unjust states."
"Ali Yilmaz was pulled out of class in a raid and wrongly suspected."
"The teachers involved were
Milosz Dudek and Thomas Liebenwerda."
In other words, yours truly.
I know the text, you don't have to read it out loud.
I want to hear it.
"To suspect a child with an immigrant background in this way without evidence
"shows that structural racism does not stop at our school either."
"That was just the beginning: without any concrete evidence,
"the good soul of the school,
Friederike Kuhn, was also suspended."
"The method is not for the faint-hearted: a hidden camera!" There we are!
"Since Ms. Nowak could not invalidate our suspicions about secret video surveillance,"
Could not invalidate!
"we spoke to the person concerned.
Ms. Kuhn confirmed that..." And so on.
How can it be that you refuse to cooperate with us on the staff but talk about the video with children who need to be told off?
I still think talking about things is better than keeping quiet about things.
And if you had read carefully, you would know that I didn't say anything about the video.
But they couldn't refute it either.
I can read. Simply unbelievable.
- You really are something.
- That's enough.
The desire to be well-received by the students...
...is getting us totally into the shit.
No idea. Ah!
Vanessa had 25 emails.
May I have your attention for a moment?
Come over here, everyone.
Quiet, please.
You too, Mr. Liebenwerda.
You have probably noticed that there is an unfortunate article in the school newspaper.
I spoke to Mr. Dudek and the legal department.
We are forced to prohibit the sale of this edition on school premises.
Ms. Böhm and I took care of the stand in the foyer.
Please prevent further distribution in the classes.
- And the online edition?
- It has already been removed.
Peace at the school is currently massively disturbed.
I therefore forbid you to talk about this subject any further with immediate effect.
Not another word, and that goes for everyone.
We will talk to you in the presence of the Staff Council.
- Are we being banned from speaking now?
- Stop it. It's not that difficult.
It's about the framework in which this takes place.
Hello! Guys, hey!
We just ask you to keep your feet still for a moment.
We must present a united front.
Even if we disagree.
- I will not be called a racist.
- That's fine!
- Milosz, you shouldn't either.
- I get it.
We should take care of the students and do our work.
Let's do our job!
Let's let the students walk all over us then.
You can just leave your stupid cynicism at home!
- I'm being called a racist here.
- I get that. Just go.
- You can't sweep away every problem.
- Just go.
Just take a deep breath.
Carla, great. I'm just saying.
You could have said something.
About what?
- Well, the interview!
- What about Oskar?
You must forget about that.
Probably the most important skill for this job. Thanks for the tip.
You are also responsible for the other students.
Okay guys, sorry I'm late.
May I ask you to stand up for a moment?
I want us... Get up!
I want us all to shout as loud as we can.
Attention. Ready. Go!
Okay, one more time.
I dare you. All of you. And!
Again!
Go on again!
- Ouch.
- Phew!
Thank you.
A few words of clarification before class:
You know what happened in the gym.
Oskar is now suspended from school for ten days.
He's not coming on the school trip either. Also...
The school magazine has caused some resentment among the staff.
The school management have banned distribution on the school grounds.
That's censorship!
I also find it crass that such measures are being taken.
I certainly won't hide my newspaper.
In principle, I think it's great how you are showing solidarity with the newspaper, even if I find the content of the text highly questionable.
- Yes?
- I'm sorry. It wasn't against you.
Thank you, Hatice.
So, newspapers gone.
Oskar, what are you doing here?
Your mother has received a letter.
- A letter?
- I told you.
I am Oskar! I'm about to run amok!
Lukas, sit down!
Let's hear it for Oskar!
Oskar! Oskar!
Hey!
Oskar, let's step out for a moment.
Oskar, come.
You can't be here.
You are not allowed to be here.
- Go home!
- Hey!
- Vera, will you look after Oskar?
- Yes.
- We talk about it. I'm not a jerk.
- Good.
I just want to find a solution.
Mr. Liebenwerda,
May I ask for your help?
Thank you.
So folks, we're going to move now.
Pack up your things.
We go next door.
Mr. Liebenwerda stays with Oskar.
- Why do we have to go somewhere else?
- No discussion.
Do what Ms. Nowak said.
Hey, Oskar.
This way.
Please go to...
Page...
... 46.
And take a look at task 13,
A to F.
I'll be right back.
- Kuhn?
- Hello, Ms. Kuhn. Carla Nowak here.
You have the nerve to call me?
It's about Oskar. Have you received the letter?
Yes. Do you think we'll let this go through?
You're weaponizing Oskar against something between the two of us.
Who is weaponizing whom here?
Throwing Oskar out of school solves the problem?
I defended him.
- That worked really well.
- You could have come too.
Now it's my fault?
- It's not about fault...
- Go back to class.
- We have to go to the bathroom.
- Then go. But come back quickly.
- Okay.
- How about an apology?
- Come and pick up Oskar.
If Oskar wants to, he can come home himself.
We told him to go. But he doesn't listen.
You can't even do that.
That's your failure. That's not my problem.
It's your son. If we fail, we fail together.
I can't get through to him.
Have you contacted the mother?
And?
He has a suspension.
We can enforce the rules.
I want to talk to him first.
Try it.
Come on, you have to go home.
Otherwise we'll have to call the police.
Do you understand, Oskar?
Oskar, will you look at me?
I wish things had turned out differently.
And I'm sorry about what happened. But if you don't go home on your own, everything will get worse.
Colleagues, let's go outside for a moment.
I don't know either.
Ms. Nowak! What are you doing?
Aren't you going to answer, Oskar?
