3
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,333
Look, Kuba.

4
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,253
They're flying away.

5
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,474
Hanka! Come over here.

6
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,978
Has God blessed you
with a good potato harvest?

7
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,064
Yes, indeed.

8
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,192
She said the baby has
the same eyes, dark and rheumy.

9
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,112
The spitting image of Boryna.

10
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,196
No!

11
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,491
Many a young girl
will chase after him.

12
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,205
They had no room for her
in the hallway, or the barn.

13
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,207
- They did the same to me.
- Right.

14
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,293
The plague-ridden scum.
Her own children.

15
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,423
It's getting cold. Come get
your mother's wool, Magda.

16
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,507
There's no point.

17
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,677
Father won't hand over anything,
not even her clothes.

18
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,761
Jagna, come.

19
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,640
You're so dressed up.

20
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,685
What a fancy necklace.

21
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,312
Made from an alder branch
I found. I cut it and...

22
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,106
Beautiful and talented.

23
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:56,361
She could marry a rich widower.

24
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,030
I won't look after
someone else's children.

25
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,782
There's nothing to worry about.

26
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,951
His are already weaned.

27
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,079
I'm fine where I am.

28
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,498
Sooner or later
you'll have to flee the nest.

29
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,794
Get a good husband
and you'll have a good farm.

30
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,796
And you'll be a good woman.

31
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,173
I don't care about that.

32
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,632
Don't talk rubbish, Jagna.

33
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:22,304
She's still young
and speaks without thinking.

34
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,951
Don't you dare
slink off to the inn.

35
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,205
- You'll feel my whip if you do.
- Come on, Mother.

36
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:49,915
No.

37
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,797
And you?
As if I needed more trouble.

38
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,673
What did I do?

39
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,926
You talked back
to the mayor's wife.

40
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,261
Do you want them
to speak ill of you?

41
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,639
I didn't mean to offend her.

42
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,683
I'm just happy here with you.

43
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,188
My dear child.

44
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,193
What's going on at Boryna's?

45
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,326
Poor thing.

46
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,497
I won't be ringing the bell
at her funeral.

47
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,750
Clink your pots instead.

48
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,835
Daddy!

49
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,212
Rosey is dying.

50
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,632
Jambrozy has bled her,
but nothing happened.

51
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,844
Then we put melted wax
down her throat. Still nothing.

52
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,345
Our best cow.

53
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,431
May the Devil twist your guts
if that's how you tend her.

54
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,644
Always eager to eat my food,
but you won't lend a hand.

55
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,105
I've been out digging potatoes
all afternoon.

56
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,940
As if you ever notice anything.

57
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,989
Scum! To waste such a beast.

58
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,369
What? Sniveling again?
It's all you're good for.

59
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,122
Leave her alone.
Don't insult my wife.

60
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,540
You're no better.

61
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,960
- Do you care for this farm?
- What am I? Your farmhand?

62
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,422
I work like a horse for nothing.
Not a nice word from you.

63
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,591
Shut up before I lose my temper.

64
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,384
You live on my land,
eat my food.

65
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:28,513
- My bread's making you bold.
- This bread is my birthright!

66
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,225
You've inherited it as I should
now inherit it from you.

67
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,979
I doubled this land
with my own hands.

68
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,733
And while these hands can work,
it stays mine.

69
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,445
If you don't like it,
try your luck elsewhere.

70
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,325
You can get fresh bread daily
from Hanka's three acres.

71
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,536
I'd eat moldy potatoes, if they
weren't thrown in my face.

72
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,010
Father wants you
to butcher the cow.

73
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,434
I'm no butcher.

74
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,443
Must you always fight with him?
He's your father.

75
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,488
Make peace with him.
Do it for us, for our children.

76
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,825
Come on, Antek.

77
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,578
You make peace if you want.

78
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,208
But don't tell me what to do.

79
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,802
Without a housewife at home,

80
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,431
there's no one
to keep tabs on things.

81
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,981
It's time for you to marry.
Period.

82
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,733
You're joking.

83
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,569
My wife's body is still warm
in her grave.

84
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,530
The whole village
would start talking.

85
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,823
Eat up.

86
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,326
Listen, Boryna.

87
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,997
There are so many
unwed girls here,

88
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,207
that when a man
goes about the houses,

89
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,419
he smolders hot as a stove.

90
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,630
Take Zoska.

91
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,010
Slender, hardworking,
and her dowry is not bad.

92
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,930
She's a grumpy shrew,
and has one thick hip.

93
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,182
What does he need her dowry for?

94
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,768
Isn't he the richest farmer
in the village?

95
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,691
How about Staszek's Weronka?

96
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,984
Taken.

97
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,987
Roch's son
sent her vodka yesterday.

98
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,242
Jagna Dominikowa?

99
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,373
A fine girl!

100
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,791
- Jagna?
- Yes.

101
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,129
They say
she's always chasing after boys.

102
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,965
Oh, well. It's just a rumor.

103
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:14,304
People gossip
just for the sake of it.

104
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:33,948
Take care.

105
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,911
I'll be back. Don't worry.

106
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:38,995
Let's go.

107
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,465
God bless.

108
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,177
Jasio left for his studies?

109
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,265
He'll be back soon enough.
I shouldn't worry.

110
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,976
He's off to the seminary
to become a priest.

111
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,105
You've brought me some herbs.

112
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,526
Thank you.
Give your mother our blessings.

113
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,613
The priest talks so well of her.

114
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:15,990
Such a wise woman.

115
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,243
Wait, I'll give you something
for these.

116
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,828
Mother said there's no need.

117
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,163
Don't be silly. I insist.

118
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,258
Poor thing. His wing is broken.

119
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,344
Will you take him, Jagna?

120
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,305
I can't. Father would
get rid of him for sure.

121
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,141
Take Storky.

122
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,601
I'll cure him before spring.

123
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:47,981
I'll feed him and everything.
Take him.

124
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,566
Do take him, Jagna.

125
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,236
Maybe I could find room
somewhere in the barn.

126
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,113
Hatching some plan, are you?

127
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,950
Antek, don't tell Father.

128
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,535
Why would I, Jozka?

129
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,122
Go home.
Father's looking for you.

130
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,221
You really want to keep
this scrawny thing?

131
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,432
I really do.

132
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,451
Have you heard?

133
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,581
The squire's driving everyone's
livestock out of Wolf's Hollow.

134
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,709
All that land! He begrudges us
our grazing rights.

135
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,261
They say your son-in-law
means to take you to court.

136
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,639
That damned blacksmith.

137
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,393
Running amok, the lot of them.
Coveting what's mine.

138
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:13,274
They might back off
if you were to marry again.

139
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,655
I won't take just any girl.

140
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,866
Throw in some land

141
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,202
and even the very best
won't hold back.

142
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,413
For land, they run
like sows to a trough.

143
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,582
Are men any different?

144
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,335
Always sniffing around
for a dowry, like dogs.

145
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,171
Only...

146
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,263
Look, it's Boryna.

147
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,099
They say the squire
wants to sell Wolf's Hollow.

148
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,433
He can want all he likes,

149
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,396
but we have wood gathering
and grazing rights there.

150
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,481
Sue him then.

151
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,150
Who has time for the courts

152
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,611
when there's so much work
to do before winter?

153
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,155
True. The burdens we bear.

154
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:17,714
Potatoes! Cheap potatoes!

155
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,279
Three notes.

156
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:07,055
If anyone has a pot with a hole,
come to me.

157
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:13,853
Boots with laces. Red and black.
And greased with fat.

158
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,083
It looks good on you.

159
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,546
How much?

160
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,756
Three notes.

161
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,426
I'll take it.

162
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,978
You'd make a fine farm boy.

163
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,106
Or not.

164
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,190
Oh, well.

165
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,900
I'd hire you in an instant.

166
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:02,902
I'd be too expensive.

167
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,028
For some,

168
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,406
but not for me.

169
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,200
And I wouldn't work
in the fields.

170
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,706
I'd do all the work for you.

171
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,721
Jagna.

172
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,559
Take this.

173
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,769
I bought it for you.

174
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:38,729
Pure silk.

175
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,276
I can't.

176
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,360
Take it, Jagna.

177
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,114
And if some boy
brings you vodka,

178
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,198
don't drink it...

179
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,326
Why the rush?

180
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,375
I said seven.

181
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,128
Six and a half.
It's all blighted.

182
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,381
Your face will be blighted after
I punch it. The wheat's pure.

183
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,265
People say
I should take you to court.

184
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,479
Go ahead!

185
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,231
Give Magda the land
that is rightfully hers.

186
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,567
I won't take it to the grave
with me.

187
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,821
But as long as I breathe,
I won't give up a single acre.

188
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,324
Then pay us the value
of those two acres.

189
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:34,619
Enough.

190
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,414
A man has a need for money

191
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,833
when he's on the lookout
for a new wife.

192
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,587
Yeah, sure.

193
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,635
If I choose to, I'll marry.

194
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:52,845
Any objections?

195
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,931
Objections? No, but...

196
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,850
I might even
send vodka tomorrow.

197
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,311
Do it. Why would I mind?

198
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,821
But give us the calf at least,
Rosey's calf,

199
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:11,906
and I'll help you.

200
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,200
You'll help. Sure you will.

201
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,284
Jambrozy!

202
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,870
Come, drink with us.

203
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,348
What are you
thinking about, Jagna?

204
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,643
Nothing much.

205
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,234
How's the stork? Better?

206
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,695
He's better, thank you.

207
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,916
I'd like to hang
onto those clouds

208
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,669
and float far away with them.

209
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,216
I'd go with you.

210
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,344
Would you like that?

211
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,848
<i>An owl sits in the grove</i>

212
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,727
<i>And listens to people talk</i>

213
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,771
<i>Day by day, night by night</i>

214
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,815
<i>There was hunger
There was passion</i>

215
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,402
<i>And listens to people talk</i>

216
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,697
<i>There were two people</i>

217
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,326
<i>And both were young</i>

218
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,536
<i>Day by day, night by night</i>

219
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,913
<i>There was hunger
There was passion</i>

220
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:46,500
<i>And both were young</i>

221
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:51,005
<i>And from their whispers
Came a...</i>

222
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,381
Shut it!

223
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:56,469
Sounds like you're being
skinned alive.

224
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,848
<i>Came a child!</i>

225
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,517
<i>Day by day, night by night</i>

226
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,895
<i>There was hunger
There was passion</i>

227
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,440
<i>And there came a child!</i>

228
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,362
<i>There were two people</i>

229
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,574
<i>And both were young</i>

230
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,744
<i>Day by day, night by night</i>

231
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,829
<i>There was hunger
There was passion</i>

232
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,166
<i>And both were young</i>

233
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,253
<i>And from their whispers...</i>

234
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,135
Did you hear that Walek

235
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,097
is sending vodka
to Ala Paciotkowa tomorrow?

236
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,099
Is she already old enough?

237
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,018
She's got so much land
that boys are in a hurry.

238
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,104
They'll line up for you too
for sure.

239
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,608
Only if your daddy doesn't spend
your dowry on a new wife first.

240
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,152
Stop spouting nonsense.

241
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,071
He buried Mother in the spring.

242
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,739
What does that matter to a man?

243
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,450
Every man is a pig,

244
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:06,455
always ready to thrust his snout
into a fresh trough.

245
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,751
Come on, Jagna!
I'm soaked to the bone.

246
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:14,213
If you run into Antek,
tell him to hurry.

247
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:18,050
- Hail Mary, full of grace...
- Hurry! Let's hurry!

248
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,302
Move, come on.

249
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,224
Come on, girl! Come on!

250
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,394
Go! Move your ass!

251
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,820
Jagna!

252
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,823
You shouldn't have loaded
so much for one horse.

253
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,409
I'm not doing two trips
in this weather.

254
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,411
We'll push on three.

255
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,748
One, two, three!

256
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,124
Come on! Move!

257
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,883
Go on! A little more!

258
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,801
You're clear now, Szymek!

259
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,596
Thank you, Antek.
God be with you!

260
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,347
- Jagna!
- You go on!

261
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,570
Hanka is waiting for you.

262
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,200
I'll walk you
to the mill, Jagna.

263
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,368
The water
has caused a breach there.

264
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,621
It got so dark, hasn't it?

265
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,873
Are you afraid?

266
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,625
Why would I be?

267
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,466
Will you come
to the cabbage party tomorrow?

268
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,719
Go now.
They are waiting for you.

269
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,519
Will you come?

270
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,479
I will.

271
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,953
Hey! Off with you!

272
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,247
- Ala and Walek got engaged.
- Really?

273
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,957
She'll be a beautiful bride.

274
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,668
She bought such pretty ribbons
at the market.

275
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,253
Beautiful for a day.

276
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,465
Until they chop off her braids
at the unveiling.

277
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,635
Then the guy
will get a surprise!

278
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,971
Jagustynka, never a nice word
for anyone.

279
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:31,225
I'm just telling it how it is.
We all have to go through that.

280
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,230
Let's have them.

281
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,942
Colorful as a flowery meadow.

282
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,862
The girls are all dressed up,
like for a wedding.

283
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:47,741
Planning on marrying cabbages,
are you, girls?

284
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,994
Did you know Mateusz is back?

285
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,830
He alone built the counselor's
house in six months.

286
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,417
He built us a new henhouse
in one day.

287
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,793
He's a skilled craftsman.

288
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,044
Skilled indeed.

289
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,256
I bet he'll be able to make

290
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,551
something new pop out
in the village in nine months.

291
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,887
Lukasz! Play some music!

292
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:26,739
Well, ladies, all this work
must be making you thirsty.

293
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,452
Jagusia, some bread and lard.

294
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,292
- Give me some.
- For you, and for you.

295
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,714
I don't like the taste of vodka.

296
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,634
One for you, Jagustynka.

297
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,390
Cheers!

298
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,808
Cheers!

299
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:05,986
Bravo!

300
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,905
- Bravo, musicians!
- Bravo!

301
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,950
Thank you for the hospitality,
but I have to run now.

302
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,826
You didn't even eat anything.

303
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,537
Mother's expecting me.

304
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,831
- God be with you.
- God be with you.

305
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,566
That one's like me.

306
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,611
Flying away before the others.

307
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,113
No.

308
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,240
This one's like you.

309
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,910
So bulky
he might fall out of the sky.

310
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:23,832
And then he'd crash
on some pretty girl below.

311
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,385
This is you.

312
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,474
I'm like dirt to you?

313
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,812
No...

314
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:52,236
You are like the holy soil
that brings life.

315
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,199
You bring life to me.

316
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,581
Yes! Come in!

317
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,626
Praised be.

318
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,044
Praised be.

319
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:13,549
Mind you, an important man
has come to see you.

320
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,633
I'm listening.

321
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:30,315
You're a wise woman, so you know
that sooner or later, Jagna...

322
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,985
has to leave her home.

323
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,083
I am bringing this
from the village's top farmer.

324
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,170
Shall we drink to that, Mother?

325
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:54,673
Drink away, but you haven't
told us who the man is.

326
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,466
Who?

327
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,430
Why, Boryna himself.

328
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,432
An old widower!

329
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,268
Old? He recently went to court
for a paternity case!

330
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,187
True...

331
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,149
- Except it wasn't his.
- Of course it wasn't.

332
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,360
A farmer like him
with a wench like that?

333
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,112
Let's drink, Mother.

334
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:21,366
I could, but likely he'll soon
be drinking with the angels.

335
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,119
Then what? His children
will kick the stepmother out.

336
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,662
No, that's not for us.

337
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:30,459
Maciej promised
a land settlement for Jagna.

338
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,255
I... the mayor, swear it.

339
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,678
Well...

340
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,477
We'll think about it.

341
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,688
Drink, Jagna.

342
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,441
Drink.

343
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,571
We've got you a man...
as solid as an oak.

344
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,200
You'll be the first lady
of the village.

345
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,496
Drink up.

346
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,832
I said, drink.

347
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:14,962
Drink, Jagna.

348
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,303
- Jagna!
- Leave her, Mother.

349
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,159
I've told you, Mateusz.

350
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,078
You did, you did...

351
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,289
What did you tell me?

352
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,417
To leave me alone.

353
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,502
I just want to talk to you.

354
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,172
Be quick. I have work to do.

355
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,802
Your mother wants to sell you.

356
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,722
Like selling a heifer
on market day.

357
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,393
You'll go with the old man?

358
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:15,272
If she tells me to, I will.
Do I have a choice?

359
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:20,110
You do!
Just tell her... what you want.

360
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,281
Sure. That's easy
for you to say.

361
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,785
Jagna.

362
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,332
- Back from your travels already?
- I'm back, Mother.

363
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:36,293
Your mother was a bitch.
There's nothing for you here.

364
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,212
I've come to see Jagna, not you.

365
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,798
Stay away from Jagna,
do you hear?

366
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:44,718
She's been maligned
in the village because of you.

367
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:57,814
I'll leave her those three acres
next to Michal's land.

368
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,486
Her late father left her five,
and one in the forest.

369
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,404
Match that and give her six.

370
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,489
What?

371
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:09,159
The land by the road is better,
where you grow potatoes.

372
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,703
Those are my best fields!

373
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,331
And isn't Jagna
the best girl in the village?

374
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,707
I suppose.

375
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:22,672
But six acres? To most people
that's a lot of land.

376
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,050
No one will take it
as long as you live,

377
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:29,262
and remember, the fields
from her father will be yours.

378
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:31,390
You can sow them immediately.

379
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,851
To you, farmer!

380
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,436
Thank you, my friends!

381
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,521
Cheers!

382
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,317
Play some music!

383
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,985
Jagusia is moving in!

384
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,741
My dear. Sit down.

385
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,709
Don't worry, Jagna!

386
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,390
You'll like it here with me.

387
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,143
Better than staying
with your mother.

388
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,369
You're on Father's side.

389
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,954
I'm on the side of order.

390
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,123
Paid you off well, has he?

391
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,667
Not from your pocket.

392
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,462
From my pocket, damn it, mine!

393
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,465
You've taken enough,
so you're not bothered.

394
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,843
And the calf he just gave you?
Is that nothing?

395
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,346
- You could have taken it too.
- I'm not a thief.

396
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,058
Calling me a thief?

397
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,143
Hey, hey!

398
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,688
I'm a public official.
Easy, Antek, or you'll be sorry.

399
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,608
You're nothing but a drunk.
A Judas and an embezzler.

400
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,444
I bet he paid you both well
to be on his side!

401
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,862
It seems to me, Antek...

402
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,782
that it's not the land
that's bugging you.

403
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:13,867
What then?

404
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,911
You've been chasing
after Jagna...

405
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,246
so now you're moody.

406
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,541
Let go of him.

407
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,001
Antek.

408
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,129
Let go of him.

409
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:37,891
And on the second day,
when all the people had left,

410
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,478
and the Blessed Virgin,
and the Holy Apostles were gone,

411
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,271
only the little dog remained.

412
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,732
And he sat, and howled...

413
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,692
Do you ever shut up?

414
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,528
Why are you
jumping down her throat?

415
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,738
Cheers!

416
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:53,949
Cheers.

417
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,078
You've signed over
a whole six acres to Jagna.

418
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,829
Because I chose to.

419
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:02,624
And if I choose, I can sign over
everything to her.

420
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,921
You could,
if it belonged only to you.

421
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,590
Who else does it belong to?

422
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,052
Who else? Tell me.

423
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,180
It's ours.

424
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:19,432
You fool. The land is mine.

425
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,769
And I'll do
whatever I want with it.

426
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,439
You can't take what's ours.

427
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,024
Listen to her!

428
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,904
Brought us three acres of sand,
and now she talks back to me.

429
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,119
If your lot is so bad here,
go find something better.

430
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,039
We're not going anywhere.
Our land is here.

431
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,042
Give it to her if you want to,

432
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,461
but divide the rest
among your children.

433
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,839
Antek, Magda and Jozka.

434
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,717
Look at her.
Now she's dividing up my land.

435
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,552
We only want what's just!

436
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,138
You'll find justice
at the end of my stick.

437
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,889
Lift a finger against her

438
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,975
and you won't live
to see your wedding day.

439
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,477
Six of our best acres
signed over to her.

440
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,939
Mother's clothing,
her beads, everything!

441
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,649
And for whom?

442
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,152
For whom? For that dirty sow!

443
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,325
- What did you say?
- She's a dirty whore...

444
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,036
and the entire village knows it.

445
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,996
The whole world even!

446
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,372
Don't you dare,

447
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,499
or I'll beat your foul mouth
to a pulp!

448
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:31,588
I'll say it too.
Your Jagna is a common whore.

449
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,424
You hear me?
Whoever wanted her, had her.

450
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,011
Stop this!

451
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,227
Antek!

452
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:52,025
For God's sake, men! Stop!

453
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,235
Enough!

454
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,204
A worthless bitch.

455
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,708
You're just too old to realize

456
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,211
that you've paid more
than others would.

457
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,926
Leave.

458
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,513
Come sunrise,
I don't want to see you here.

459
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,139
Why so gloomy?

460
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:09,269
Don't be like this with Boryna.
Be soft, be gentle...

461
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:14,023
He might gift you more land
or toss a pretty coin your way.

462
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,608
I don't care about money.

463
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:19,112
There must be something
more important.

464
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,618
Have you no fear of God?
Foolish girl.

465
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,164
Look. Look!

466
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:33,126
Your settlement from Boryna,
six acres of pure soil.

467
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:37,380
Do you think that you'd be happy
without that holy soil?

468
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,341
God did not create you
to be poor. No!

469
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:57,358
Love comes and goes...
but land remains.

470
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,877
<i>She let her golden hair down</i>

471
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,632
Welcome! Drink people, drink!
Drink, my dears!

472
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:26,429
<i>Her golden hair</i>

473
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:35,814
<i>She let her golden hair down</i>

474
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:43,488
<i>Her golden hair</i>

475
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:51,162
<i>Don't let me go</i>

476
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:56,251
<i>Please, Mum</i>

477
00:38:56,793 --> 00:39:01,506
<i>Don't let me go</i>

478
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:06,261
<i>Don't let me go</i>

479
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:11,266
<i>Please, Mum</i>

480
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:17,480
<i>Don't let me go</i>

481
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:23,319
<i>Let me stay</i>

482
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:32,954
<i>How can I, my dear child</i>

483
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:41,087
<i>Not let you go?</i>

484
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:49,846
<i>How can I, my dear child</i>

485
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:57,937
<i>Not let you go?</i>

486
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:04,110
<i>A good man</i>

487
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:09,032
<i>Came to claim you</i>

488
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:13,369
<i>To be his wife</i>

489
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:18,499
<i>A good man</i>

490
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:23,254
<i>Came to claim you</i>

491
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:28,801
<i>To be his wife</i>

492
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:36,351
<i>To be his wife</i>

493
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:52,450
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

494
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,872
Eat something.

495
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,583
Look at her. A grand lady.

496
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,504
She's the first lady
of Lipce now,

497
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,756
and she sits there
as if she's at a funeral.

498
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:07,966
She's overwhelmed.

499
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,677
She's a beauty though.
I'll give her that.

500
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,845
Why wouldn't she be?

501
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,014
All she does is sleep and eat.

502
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,892
And lie behind every bush
with anyone in trousers.

503
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,520
Zoska, in the name
of the Holy Virgin.

504
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,438
This is no place
for such gossip.

505
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:25,108
They'll last till spring.

506
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,194
Then she'll get bored
and start chasing farmhands.

507
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,612
Her mother was the same.

508
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,155
Jagustynka.

509
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,241
Aren't I right?

510
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,535
She prays away now

511
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,287
because she's wrinkled
as a potato after winter.

512
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,625
But in her youth, she'd fall
on her knees for other reasons.

513
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,044
Now she'll feel at home.

514
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,339
And help herself
to Mother's things.

515
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,800
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

516
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:55,179
- We'll fight for what's ours.
- One, two...

517
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,058
Go on, dance.

518
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,647
Beautiful!

519
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,733
Look, Mother.
Our Jagna looks beautiful.

520
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,446
- Pour!
- More!

521
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,741
So beautiful!

522
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,241
There's never been
a wedding like this in Lipce,

523
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:41,577
nor will there ever be again.

524
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,082
Jagna, my beauty!

525
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:49,418
- I have to rejoin the guests!
- What a hostess.

526
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,420
Drink, young lady!

527
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:52,755
- Bottoms up!
- Cheers!

528
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,132
Bottoms up!

529
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,593
Cheers! Bottoms up!

530
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:19,699
Come on! Come on, follow me!

531
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,038
Come on, follow me!
Come with me!

532
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,290
I hear they are hiring
at the mill.

533
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,377
I told you already.

534
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,546
I won't work
for the peasants here.

535
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,800
Maybe... I could work there.

536
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,093
Don't be silly, Dad.

537
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,056
Antek, we're living
on potatoes and salt.

538
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:32,308
I won't work in Lipce.

539
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:36,187
It's been more than three weeks
since anyone's spoken to me.

540
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,772
You fought with your father.

541
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,733
Don't other men
fight with their fathers?

542
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:45,071
Maybe, but you're the only one
whose father is Boryna.

543
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,865
Let them spit on me.
You want that?

544
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,743
It's not about what I want,
it's about what we need!

545
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:09,011
And the old man.
He boils milk for her,

546
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:12,681
makes her tea,
and brings it to her bed.

547
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,559
He waits on her hand and foot,

548
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,145
but Jagna will go back
to her old ways soon enough.

549
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,191
I heard that she's frisky
toward her stepson.

550
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:27,780
Nah! All the gossip about them
knowing each other is not true.

551
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,741
I heard that he'd whine
at her door

552
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:33,244
and she had to chase him off
with a broom.

553
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,288
Many a time
she complained to me.

554
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:38,374
Wasn't I in her bedroom
more than once?

555
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,709
You're not the first
nor the last to do so.

556
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,712
You're lying.

557
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:46,966
What did you say?

558
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,136
You're lying, you scum.

559
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,015
Boys!

560
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:57,143
Stop!

561
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,187
Antek!

562
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,943
Mateusz!

563
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,780
Jesus, he's gone
straight under the wheels.

564
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:12,992
I'll do the same thing to anyone
else who bothers Jagna.

565
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,121
Mateusz! He's alive?

566
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,541
He's alive. He's alive!

567
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:29,467
Beautiful!

568
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,593
It's not.

569
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,136
Witek, is the stove hot yet?

570
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:37,183
I'll bring more wood.

571
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:40,019
Close the door!
The cold is getting in!

572
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,903
Master Jasio!
Praised be Jesus Christ!

573
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,530
Forever and ever.
I bring the altar breads.

574
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:52,781
Welcome, Jasio!

575
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:54,033
Good day.

576
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,784
Back from school already?

577
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:57,620
Since Sunday, three days ago.

578
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,497
What's new?

579
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,374
Everything is quiet
with us peasants, as usual.

580
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,960
Quiet? What about your wedding?

581
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:06,170
It was so much fun

582
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,422
that people kept dancing
for three days.

583
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,717
Look at Jagna's cutouts.

584
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,143
Very beautiful.

585
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,395
Truly.

586
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,023
- I ran into Antek.
- Oh, yes?

587
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,234
He's grown so thin.
He looked weary.

588
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,653
Weary indeed.

589
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:37,785
He wore himself out...
while breaking Mateusz's ribs.

590
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:42,581
Thank you for your hospitality.
And... Merry Christmas.

591
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:43,832
Goodbye, Jasio.

592
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,876
God be with you, Jasio.

593
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,924
What happened?
Why were they fighting?

594
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,801
Why, over you, of course.

595
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,930
Like dogs fighting
over a bitch in heat.

596
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,098
You're lying.

597
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:03,018
I'm telling the truth! Mateusz
was boasting to the peasants

598
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:05,396
that he spent time
in your bedroom.

599
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:09,525
So Antek
almost beat him to death.

600
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:12,444
Don't you worry, dear.

601
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:15,698
Antek will fight
against the whole world for you.

602
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,683
Maciej, did you see what we
sent you with the farmhand?

603
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:46,770
Ah, yes. Fine work, Michal.
Thank you.

604
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:49,106
I see you're wearing
Mother's hat.

605
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,319
It suits you.

606
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:55,863
Let's go.

607
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:18,719
Jagna, come to the meadow
one day.

608
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,641
- I have a husband.
- Yes, you do. My father.

609
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:27,728
Can you change that?

610
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,630
Easy... I come in peace.

611
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,682
You shamed me
in front of the whole world.

612
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:09,019
You beat me so badly
they even summoned the priest.

613
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,731
But I am not holding a grudge.

614
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,901
Why were you lying to the men?

615
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,696
I only said those things
because I was angry...

616
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,324
Who am I to Jagna?

617
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,082
Welcome!

618
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,168
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

619
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,587
- Welcome!
- Praised be.

620
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,506
Praised be.
Are they in the alcove?

621
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,508
Come, Jagna.

622
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,516
Forget about it
while you still can.

623
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,809
How can I,

624
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,813
when it runs through my bones
like fire?

625
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:55,107
I know how it feels.

626
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,402
Didn't I go after her myself?

627
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,321
But she preferred you.

628
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:05,534
The squire had no right.

629
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:11,039
Yet, he's sold logging rights
in Wolf Hollow!

630
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,501
Lipce has always
had rights there.

631
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:16,754
He owns the wood.

632
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,090
But we will seek a compromise.

633
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:24,219
What compromise?
The forest is already sold.

634
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:27,973
They marked the trees
and will start cutting them.

635
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:31,018
Let them mark them.
We won't let him cut them down.

636
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,479
We won't let him.

637
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,292
I wait every day.

638
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,252
You think I can leave?
They watch me.

639
00:54:57,336 --> 00:55:00,964
Play the volta, boys!
And make it lively!

640
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,476
I was only...

641
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,228
I was only dancing.

642
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,314
He'll weep someday...

643
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,900
- Move.
- I was only dancing!

644
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,569
- Move!
- Leave me!

645
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:01,835
Stupid.

646
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,214
Decorates the house,
but she can't see the dirt.

647
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:07,633
That's because it's clean.

648
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,760
Has the illness
got to your eyes?

649
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,471
I swear, when I get up,
you'll regret it.

650
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:13,889
Shush, Jagna!

651
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,517
Go and see if Jozka needs help.

652
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,734
Come on, it's not her fault.

653
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,235
Whose fault is it then?

654
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:30,322
You left her to go drinking
in the back room.

655
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:34,284
The music was playing,
everyone was having fun dancing.

656
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:37,245
What was she meant to do?

657
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,581
Stand in a corner
like some old maid?

658
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:43,001
Just cure me
and don't give me life lessons.

659
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:50,342
I know well enough.

660
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:06,316
Hanka?

661
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,442
Hanka!

662
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:17,119
For the love of God, Hanka!

663
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:32,801
Stop by some time.
Even tomorrow.

664
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:36,722
You drove us out.
So how could I come to see you?

665
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,272
I can't let you
and my grandchildren starve.

666
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:50,235
Go!

667
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:23,602
<i>In the cherry orchard
Walked a pretty girl</i>

668
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:27,814
<i>In the cherry orchard
Walked a pretty girl</i>

669
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:31,735
<i>Searching for her lost innocence</i>

670
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:38,909
It's the revelers!
The revelers are here!

671
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,870
Fire... Fire!

672
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:39,779
Fire.

673
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:45,327
Fire!

674
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,746
People, fire!

675
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,463
Jagna's apron.

676
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,798
Give it to me. Keep working.

677
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:01,134
They say that Boryna
caught them in the hay

678
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:03,470
and that's
when the fire started.

679
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,806
Antek did it, for sure,
out of spite.

680
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,017
Did you see it?
Did you see him light it?

681
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:12,145
Then what are you
blabbering for?

682
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:14,898
I heard the old man
beat her so badly

683
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,608
that she's still lying ill.

684
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,319
I said it would end like this.

685
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,904
That's enough. Quiet.

686
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,831
I see you've been begging.

687
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:36,544
Since we live like beggars,
I seek compassion elsewhere.

688
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:38,797
You have no shame.

689
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:51,142
Is it from Father?

690
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:55,730
I told you not to go to him,
damn it.

691
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,565
He invited me, so I went.

692
01:02:57,649 --> 01:03:00,568
The children and I won't starve
because you don't care.

693
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:03,238
Take it back now.
I don't need anything from him.

694
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,156
But the children do,
and so do I!

695
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,910
Take it back or I'll take it
and shove it down his throat!

696
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,954
He can choke on his charity.

697
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:19,170
I dare you!
Touch it and you'll see!

698
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,465
He bought you cheap.

699
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:25,385
With a crust of bread...
like a stray dog.

700
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:30,515
You've sold us even cheaper,
for a scrap of Jagna's skirt.

701
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:35,395
Go on! Run to your bitch!

702
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,374
Lipce must fight.

703
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:01,755
They took our wood today.

704
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:07,469
If we don't defend ourselves,
they'll come for our land next.

705
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:10,013
Our homes,
everything that we own.

706
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:15,310
Slaves of the squire or Boryna,
what's the difference?

707
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,729
Goodness, stop this nonsense.

708
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,108
It's no wonder
he's punishing you now.

709
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:28,156
He's made of flesh and blood,
not paper like your cutouts.

710
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:30,992
He's your husband.

711
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,248
I did not choose him.

712
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:04,609
Do you love me?

713
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:06,444
Haven't I said so?

714
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,782
Because I don't come
every time you call?

715
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,283
You love me indeed.

716
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:18,248
Like some mad dog that can bite
and you can't shake off!

717
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:24,504
I have to go now.

718
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:30,760
If I've gone mad,
it is because of you.

719
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:32,595
Because I loved you.
You understand?

720
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:36,182
You love me?
You only take it out on me.

721
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:39,394
What?
You need another man already?

722
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:46,526
You think I ever wanted you?
Boryna's farmhand?

723
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:09,215
People, we have suffered
an injustice.

724
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:12,218
An injustice we cannot tolerate.

725
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:15,221
We have rights in Wolf's Hollow.

726
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,265
The forest is ours

727
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:18,808
<i>and the squire is cutting it.</i>

728
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,228
<i>We complained in vain.</i>

729
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:27,150
<i>We took the squire to the court.
Justice was denied to us.</i>

730
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:31,070
But enough is enough.
They are cutting down our wood!

731
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,823
- Are we going to let them?
- No!

732
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:36,326
We must defend what's ours.

733
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:37,911
Look, it's a mob.

734
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,204
Fetch the horsemen.

735
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,789
<i>Don't be afraid, people.</i>

736
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:48,338
<i>It's our right,
our will, our justice.</i>

737
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:50,882
<i>All together, people.</i>

738
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,052
<i>Follow me, people!
To the forest!</i>

739
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,386
To the forest!

740
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,138
Don't just stand there! Attack!

741
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:10,735
Jagustynka, take the women
and smash their shacks.

742
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:12,403
How many times do we have to...

743
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:16,407
Traitors!

744
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:23,164
Horsemen!

745
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:25,875
Watch out, men!

746
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,880
Come on, men!
Rally round, don't give up!

747
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:38,846
Son of a bitch.

748
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:41,933
Get the horses!

749
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:28,229
Boryna!

750
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:56,633
Jesus!

751
01:08:57,592 --> 01:08:59,385
- Is he dead?
- Is he breathing?

752
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,056
Father.

753
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:08,811
Show me Anton Boryna!

754
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:09,896
Soldiers.

755
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:10,980
Father.

756
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,733
Is that you, my son?

757
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:16,986
It's you...

758
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,406
He was defending his father.

759
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:21,658
Justice is on our side.

760
01:09:24,202 --> 01:09:27,246
You're all... under arrest!

761
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:30,541
Us? Arrest them!

762
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:32,377
Take everyone except women!

763
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,295
Father. I'm sorry...

764
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:35,630
Stand up.

765
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:38,841
- You're coming with me.
- Maciej, no...

766
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,680
Our Father, who art in heaven,

767
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:48,976
hallowed be Thy name,
Thy kingdom come.

768
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:55,108
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

769
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:59,821
Give us this day our daily bread

770
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:03,616
and forgive us our trespasses

771
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:07,620
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

772
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:38,234
I thought only peasants
are up at this hour.

773
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:42,113
Blacksmiths don't need
to get up at dawn.

774
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:46,701
With Father ill, and Antek
and the rest in jail...

775
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,287
I thought I'd check in on you.

776
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,371
No need, thanks.

777
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:52,915
I'm keeping my eye on things,
as Father asked.

778
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:55,626
Four eyes can see more than two.

779
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,716
I'll wait until Jagna's up.

780
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:02,884
Wait all you want.

781
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:08,306
Get out, Hanka.

782
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:12,143
Quiet. There's a sick man here.

783
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:13,936
Not that you care.

784
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:19,484
He could be starving to death
and you wouldn't lift a finger,

785
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:20,693
heiress.

786
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:23,905
My husband is my business,
not yours.

787
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:27,074
The whole farm would go to ruin
if you were to run things.

788
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:30,077
That's why Father
put me in charge.

789
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:35,708
And go feed
that whining cow of yours.

790
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:09,200
Has he said anything?

791
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:11,202
Jesus, Michal.

792
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:14,163
Sorry, Jagna.
I didn't mean to scare you.

793
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,416
I came to see
how Father is doing.

794
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:20,586
Did he say anything?

795
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:22,588
No.

796
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:28,135
The organist told me
that Father has a lot of money.

797
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,101
He probably hid it
in the storeroom.

798
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:40,565
Let's split the money evenly
before Hanka steals everything.

799
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,526
Just give me the key, Jagna.

800
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:45,862
Hanka has the keys now.

801
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,826
Don't turn your back on me
when I'm talking to you.

802
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:05,339
You're running errands now?

803
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,346
It'd probably
be easier for you...

804
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,349
if they let Antek out?

805
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:18,352
I can make inquiries.

806
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,397
I have influence.

807
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,151
Come.

808
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:28,112
Sit down with me.

809
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,114
We'll figure it out.

810
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:33,576
If you have such influence,
why are the men still in jail?

811
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,872
- For defending what's theirs?
- Don't get upset, Jagna.

812
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:42,251
I am on your side.

813
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:45,421
I can help Antek.

814
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,593
Keep cranking.

815
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:19,413
Hanka!

816
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:22,875
Why are you yelling?

817
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:24,961
You hung that thing over my bed.

818
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:28,297
- That was the only place for it.
- Isn't it convenient for you?

819
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:31,008
If you get hungry,
you can rip a piece off,

820
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:33,552
since you always take
what others worked for.

821
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:35,805
Let her go
if she wants to fight.

822
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:38,933
I dare you.
I'll scratch that pretty face

823
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,394
so even your own mother
won't recognize you.

824
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,478
Hanka!

825
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:52,571
Hanka...

826
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,074
throw them out.

827
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:57,576
Are you in pain?

828
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,830
Throw them all out.

829
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:14,176
Come, come, now.

830
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:25,396
In the storeroom. In the wheat.
Inside the wheat barrel...

831
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:28,691
you'll find some money. Hide it!

832
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:31,235
<i>So they don't take it from you.</i>

833
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:35,072
<i>Save Antek.</i>

834
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,367
<i>Don't let them take it.</i>

835
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,120
<i>It's yours.</i>

836
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,206
All yours.

837
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:57,845
<i>You said you could help Antek.</i>

838
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,890
All in good time.

839
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:17,907
Come, Jagna, come.
Let's rest here.

840
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,623
- Look!
- There's nothing to see here.

841
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:30,669
Come here, Jagna. Come now...

842
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:55,694
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

843
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:02,034
Touch me again, you pig,
and I'll tell everyone.

844
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:04,870
Tell them...
As if anyone would believe you.

845
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:11,669
<i>Per eundem Christum,
Dominum nostrum.</i>

846
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:12,837
Amen.

847
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:38,279
<i>O, happy day is upon us</i>

848
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:45,369
<i>Our prayers were not in vain</i>

849
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:52,585
<i>For Christ has risen today</i>

850
01:17:53,210 --> 01:18:00,050
<i>Hallelujah, hallelujah!</i>

851
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:07,016
<i>Heavenly King we praise</i>

852
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:14,315
<i>Yearn for His beauty and grace</i>

853
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:21,197
<i>For He has conquered death</i>

854
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:28,204
<i>Hallelujah, hallelujah!</i>

855
01:18:57,483 --> 01:18:59,860
<i>Come, farmer.</i>

856
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:11,747
<i>Farmer.</i>

857
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:24,593
<i>Farmer.</i>

858
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:35,479
Time to sow.

859
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,022
<i>Time to sow.</i>

860
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:47,157
Time to sow...

861
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:03,048
Time to...

862
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:04,925
sow...

863
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:05,361
<i>Dear God, giver of salvation
and forgiveness.</i>

864
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:12,910
We ask for your mercy
to take Boryna, your servant.

865
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:17,998
By the grace of the Virgin Mary
and all the Saints.

866
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:24,922
To you, with eternal blessing.

867
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:30,552
For Jesus Christ,
our Lord. Amen.

868
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,217
Come to me.

869
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:47,337
So, what's new, Hanka?

870
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:50,090
Everything is as usual.
Plenty of work to be done.

871
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:51,175
As usual?

872
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:54,887
You took Father's money?

873
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:58,223
You would steal it, so you think
everyone is like you?

874
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,561
What you've stolen is yours.

875
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,689
But the land must be divided.
I won't give it up.

876
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:08,275
I'm just minding
my husband's property.

877
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:09,651
I have no rights here.

878
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:12,362
Now that Father's dead,
Antek is in charge.

879
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:13,780
It's all up to him.

880
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:16,325
In charge
of his prison cell maybe.

881
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:19,369
But honest people
will make the decisions here.

882
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:21,914
"Honest." Look at him.

883
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:25,417
You only want to grab
as much as you can.

884
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:32,007
Oh, poor little thing.

885
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:35,677
Sitting on six acres of
our finest land, looking pretty.

886
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:38,430
You're right, Hanka.

887
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:43,310
Let's wait...
for Antek to return.

888
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,023
He can take it up
with this harlot.

889
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:58,659
I wish I'd broken my legs
before I entered this house.

890
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:01,537
No one's tied you down.
You were free to leave anytime.

891
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:07,209
Don't complain
after what I've suffered.

892
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:08,585
What have I done?

893
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:11,463
Have I stolen anything?
Killed somebody?

894
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:13,799
You went after him
like a bitch in heat

895
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,551
when you knew he had a family.

896
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:19,555
I went after him, did I?
You don't see his faults?

897
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:22,432
How he'd stand by my door

898
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:24,601
even to get
a glimpse of my shoe.

899
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:27,354
It was he who befuddled me
and did as he pleased.

900
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:33,777
You want to know the truth?
However, you may regret it.

901
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:36,822
If I wanted, he'd kick you out

902
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:40,284
and follow me anywhere,
no matter what you do.

903
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:42,244
Don't you dare
compare yourself to me.

904
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,955
Get out of this house now!
Get out!

905
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:49,751
Don't let Antek
turn away from us again.

906
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,424
Here. Is this what you want?

907
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:59,344
Take it then and I hope
you choke on it to death!

908
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:36,775
Jagna.

909
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:41,947
Don't touch me.

910
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,990
Say what you wanted
to say to me.

911
01:26:44,658 --> 01:26:46,576
Don't be afraid of me, Jagna.

912
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:57,295
I hardly recognize you.

913
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:00,632
I'm the same person
I was when you left me.

914
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:02,008
I never left you.

915
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:06,763
I've been thinking about you
day and night.

916
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:09,349
Maybe you had
something else on your mind?

917
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:12,561
Yes, I did. I was thinking
about how you disgraced me.

918
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:13,937
How I disgraced you?

919
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:17,274
Did I ask you
to become my stepmother?

920
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:21,027
Did I force you
to fool around with the mayor?

921
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:39,379
Jagna, would you
run away with me?

922
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:51,850
Antek, no!

923
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:41,149
<i>An owl sits in the grove</i>

924
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:46,029
<i>And listens to people talk</i>

925
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:49,449
<i>Day by day, night by night</i>

926
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:52,244
<i>There was hunger
There was passion</i>

927
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:56,790
<i>And listens to people talk</i>

928
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:11,096
What a drought.

929
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:20,313
We were so worried about you.

930
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:25,068
Luckily, Hanka bailed you out.

931
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:30,657
Worried, were you?

932
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:33,410
Of course.

933
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:37,163
You are the first farmer now.

934
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:55,682
Two sacks for you, ma'am.

935
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:57,934
Hanka?

936
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:01,479
How easily the inheritance
passed on to you.

937
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:05,400
You only need to kick Jozka out
and all will be yours.

938
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:09,988
Got your eye on Jagna already?

939
01:30:10,947 --> 01:30:12,324
She's just become a widow.

940
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:15,827
It's not that. Just saying Hanka
had no right to kick her out.

941
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:18,163
- It was Jagna's home.
- It wasn't.

942
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:20,665
It's back where it belongs,
with the family.

943
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:21,958
Are you sure?

944
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:25,420
Her mother has filed
Jagna's claim at court.

945
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:29,674
They'll get her property back.

946
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:33,094
We'll see.

947
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:44,022
Jagna.

948
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:48,401
People are complaining
about you in the village.

949
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:49,861
Let them bark.

950
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:53,406
They're hot and moody
and it makes them angry.

951
01:30:57,994 --> 01:30:59,079
You know...

952
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:05,877
The men... are already
lining up to bring you vodka.

953
01:31:08,046 --> 01:31:09,798
Let them drink it themselves.

954
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:16,179
Not all men are alike.

955
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:24,312
Maybe it would...
help you in the village...

956
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:27,774
if you chose someone.

957
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:31,736
It'd stop people's tongues
from wagging.

958
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,488
I don't need help from men.

959
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:42,455
I've had enough
of their help already.

960
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:48,878
Jagna, my dear child.
Haven't you slept?

961
01:31:52,132 --> 01:31:56,886
Why did you reject Mateusz?
He's a good carpenter.

962
01:32:00,306 --> 01:32:02,434
Wasn't that Jesus's profession?

963
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:07,230
He has his past,
but so do you now.

964
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:10,650
I don't want Mateusz.
I don't want any man.

965
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:11,818
Don't talk like that!

966
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:16,489
You need to go to confession.
You can do penance

967
01:32:16,573 --> 01:32:18,658
and with time,
people will forgive you.

968
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:19,993
I won't go to confession.

969
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:21,911
Fear the Lord, child.

970
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,918
Praise be to God.

971
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:32,047
Praise be, Hanka.

972
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:33,381
I'm going on a pilgrimage.

973
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:36,468
Please forgive me for any sins
I committed against you.

974
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:39,763
God bless you
for your kind words.

975
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:41,347
But what's done is done.

976
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:46,019
I ask you from my heart
for forgiveness.

977
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:51,566
I don't hold a grudge
in my heart.

978
01:33:03,536 --> 01:33:04,788
I'll pray for you.

979
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:27,811
Jagna?

980
01:33:28,978 --> 01:33:31,523
Don't you recognize me?

981
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:34,567
How could I not recognize you?

982
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:37,946
It's just that you look
so elegant now, so different.

983
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,698
You're coming back
from your travels.

984
01:33:41,241 --> 01:33:44,452
Right now, I came here
from home to get some peace.

985
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:47,372
- And you?
- Just wandering around.

986
01:33:51,084 --> 01:33:52,085
Is that a holy book?

987
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:54,420
No, it's about
faraway countries and oceans.

988
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:56,589
Jesus! About oceans!

989
01:33:57,173 --> 01:33:58,341
Have a look!

990
01:34:01,427 --> 01:34:02,428
Look.

991
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:03,972
See this pyramid?

992
01:34:05,265 --> 01:34:08,143
It's taller
than five of our churches

993
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:10,520
stacked on top of each other.

994
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:13,439
It must be like a mountain.

995
01:34:18,528 --> 01:34:21,489
And what are these?
They look like my cutouts.

996
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:25,952
I saw your beautiful cutouts
when I visited you at Christmas.

997
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,454
Not even in the Warsaw markets

998
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:30,290
have I seen cutouts
as beautiful.

999
01:34:30,373 --> 01:34:32,876
They've been looking for you,
Master Jasio!

1000
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:35,044
- All over the village.
- I better go.

1001
01:34:35,128 --> 01:34:37,797
Interrupted your prayers,
have I?

1002
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:39,382
Goodbye.

1003
01:34:39,465 --> 01:34:46,431
A secluded place,
far from people's eyes.

1004
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:49,142
May your foul tongue shrivel.

1005
01:34:51,895 --> 01:34:55,940
So I rush off to look for him,
I look around, and...

1006
01:34:57,066 --> 01:34:59,652
Excuse me, Jasio lost his book.

1007
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:01,446
What a nerve.

1008
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:06,117
Get away from here.
Never show your face here again!

1009
01:35:06,993 --> 01:35:09,454
I'll not shed tears
because of you,

1010
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:12,540
like Hanka
and the mayor's wife did.

1011
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:15,251
I'll teach you not to flirt.

1012
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:18,004
You'll remember me, you hussy.

1013
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:20,423
Go to your kennel, bitch!

1014
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:28,389
I heard that Jagna
is now after the organist's son.

1015
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:32,685
Has your time in prison made you
hungry for gossip?

1016
01:35:32,769 --> 01:35:34,562
I'm only repeating what I heard.

1017
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:39,651
Tell me who said so,
and I'll set them straight.

1018
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:49,160
I won't give a single zloty!

1019
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:54,290
Five thousand is missing
from the district's treasury.

1020
01:35:54,374 --> 01:35:56,459
They're taking
the whole farm from them.

1021
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:59,629
And if that wasn't enough,
Lipce has to pay for the rest!

1022
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:01,464
I'm not going to pay anything!

1023
01:36:01,547 --> 01:36:02,799
People!

1024
01:36:04,133 --> 01:36:06,803
Don't you know
how the mayor spent this money?

1025
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:10,932
- On Jagna.
- That's right! Of course!

1026
01:36:11,015 --> 01:36:15,561
That's twiddle-twaddle.
You saw that, did you?

1027
01:36:15,645 --> 01:36:18,481
You think I don't know?
You think I'm not ashamed

1028
01:36:18,564 --> 01:36:20,942
- to have a whore in the family?
- Do something.

1029
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:24,320
True, she is a debauchee.
I will not pay for her.

1030
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:31,744
She bewitched my man.
He'd buy her anything.

1031
01:36:31,828 --> 01:36:35,164
Everyone saw it!
Where did she get those dresses?

1032
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:40,211
Because she was Boryna's wife!

1033
01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:43,381
She got all the fancy clothes
from him!

1034
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:48,553
What do you care?
Why are you on her side?

1035
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:51,097
Mother of God, save us.

1036
01:36:59,981 --> 01:37:02,233
She even tried
to seduce my Jasio.

1037
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:03,985
Oh, my!

1038
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:06,863
The innocent boy ran
and told me everything.

1039
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:11,075
That's horrible.
Not even a priest is safe!

1040
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:14,579
Look at the poor harvest
we've had.

1041
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:18,207
Surely, a whore like that

1042
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:21,210
has brought God's wrath
upon the village.

1043
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:23,046
- It's all her fault.
- Time to end it.

1044
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:25,256
There's only one way.
Banish her.

1045
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:26,841
Exactly!

1046
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:28,092
That's how it must be.

1047
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:33,264
Everyone has agreed to banish
Jagna from the village.

1048
01:37:33,348 --> 01:37:34,474
Yeah, banish her.

1049
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:35,808
Say your piece, Antoni.

1050
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:37,185
Banish her. That's right.

1051
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:41,314
Well, Antoni,
we're all listening.

1052
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:49,864
With your father gone,
you're our first farmer now.

1053
01:37:51,449 --> 01:37:53,117
We can't decide without you.

1054
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:56,746
Quiet now.

1055
01:37:58,623 --> 01:37:59,707
Quiet.

1056
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:11,886
I live in this village
and I stand with its people.

1057
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:18,184
You want to expel her,
then do so.

1058
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:24,982
You want to put her
on the altar? Then do that.

1059
01:38:26,442 --> 01:38:27,985
It is all the same to me.

1060
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:31,114
So, we banish her.

1061
01:38:31,197 --> 01:38:32,532
Antek!

1062
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:35,952
Now we must sort this out.

1063
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:44,752
You know
what they'll do to Jagna.

1064
01:38:48,131 --> 01:38:50,508
The law... is on their side.

1065
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:55,721
To hell with the law.

1066
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:58,599
What they're accusing her of...
it's not true.

1067
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:00,685
Will you stand
against the whole village?

1068
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:03,312
- Are you on their side?
- I'm on no one's side.

1069
01:39:04,647 --> 01:39:07,817
But I care for her as much
as I care for dirt.

1070
01:39:08,693 --> 01:39:09,861
Jesus!

1071
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:13,156
That you should...

1072
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:17,118
dare to kick out
a person like...

1073
01:39:19,245 --> 01:39:20,329
a rabid dog.

1074
01:39:25,168 --> 01:39:26,377
Antek!

1075
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:31,924
Your word means something.

1076
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:40,808
It's too late.

1077
01:40:39,492 --> 01:40:42,078
Mother, the whole village
is coming for her!

1078
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:43,996
Quick! Close the door.

1079
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,164
Take her away!

1080
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:46,290
Hide!

1081
01:40:46,374 --> 01:40:47,750
I won't hide from anyone.

1082
01:40:49,418 --> 01:40:51,128
- What are you doing?
- Take it.

1083
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:55,049
Together, men! One, two, three!

1084
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:56,217
Hold it!

1085
01:41:03,349 --> 01:41:05,601
Jagna! Jagna!

1086
01:41:06,769 --> 01:41:09,897
People! People! Move back...

1087
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:11,857
What are you doing here?

1088
01:41:11,941 --> 01:41:13,359
What are you doing...

1089
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:23,119
- Leave Jagna alone!
- Out the way, Mother!

1090
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:27,540
Mother!

1091
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:33,879
- Grab her!
- Yes!

1092
01:41:33,963 --> 01:41:34,964
Take her!

1093
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,257
Come here!

1094
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:37,341
Come here!

1095
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:42,847
You'll pay for everything.
You'll pay, you whore.

1096
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,056
Whore!

1097
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:46,475
What now, hussy?

1098
01:41:48,728 --> 01:41:50,813
Not so pretty anymore.

1099
01:41:52,815 --> 01:41:55,693
- Right in that painted face!
- Take her out!

1100
01:42:13,502 --> 01:42:17,840
You've had your fun?
Shame on you now!

1101
01:42:17,923 --> 01:42:19,508
Take her to the soldiers!

1102
01:42:19,592 --> 01:42:22,219
Feel the same shame
you made us feel!

1103
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:24,889
The holy ground
would spit you out!

1104
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:27,558
The bitch deserves it.

1105
01:42:28,476 --> 01:42:30,686
Go to hell, slut!

1106
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:33,314
Get her down! Bitch!

1107
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:38,903
Get her on the cart!

1108
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:40,696
Tie her up!

1109
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:43,658
Tie her up!

1110
01:43:40,589 --> 01:43:42,216
That's enough!

1111
01:43:53,602 --> 01:43:57,898
Come back to the village
and we'll set the dogs on you.
