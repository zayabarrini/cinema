1
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:43,418
<i>1944: Summer war</i>

2
00:02:47,883 --> 00:02:52,754
... and our Fuhrer Adolf Hitler
will be grateful for what you've done.

3
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:55,581
I speak here in his name.

4
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,623
"Operation harvest" is a great service
to the people and to the soldiers.

5
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:05,672
Your sense of duty is
the very cornerstone of our society.

6
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:10,790
Furthermore, it sets a great example
for generations to come.

7
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:13,247
Girls,

8
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:17,696
daughters of the city of Hamburg,
stricken with grief and yet so proud,

9
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:20,751
on behalf of our leader
and of the country's peasantry,

10
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,965
I hereby thank you for volunteering.

11
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:28,113
As I'm in charge of "Operation Harvest"
among the NSDAP's youth movement

12
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,331
in Hamburg
and Schleswig-Holstein,

13
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,334
It's my duty to urge you...

14
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:36,706
to urge you: keep it up!

15
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,821
<i>To our great Fuhrer Adolf Hitler.
Sieg Heil!</i>

16
00:03:40,873 --> 00:03:43,673
That's for the official part.

17
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:46,965
And now I have a little surprise.
How many are they? 32?

18
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:49,498
31. One of them got sick.

19
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:52,549
It's only a matter of good will
and dedication.

20
00:03:53,217 --> 00:03:55,873
Since you helped with the harvest,
your comrades

21
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:57,792
have expressed
their gratitude by donating

22
00:03:58,008 --> 00:04:01,006
a pound of hard wheat
and a pound of rye wheat.

23
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:02,504
Silence!

24
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:06,185
And now, let me hand you
a small token of my appreciation.

25
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,330
Here.

26
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,254
A cornflower
to each and every one of you.

27
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,422
Germany's harvest flower.

28
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:15,631
The flower
of our great queen Louise.

29
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,590
The flower of loyalty.

30
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,832
- What's your name?
- Henny Jansen.

31
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:22,248
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- No.

32
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:26,915
- I've seen you working without letup!
- Sure.

33
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,840
She also ate her heart out!

34
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,088
And she was right to do so.

35
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,967
Who works well
has the right to eat well.

36
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:38,918
I knew a carver who liked to work
with models built like you.

37
00:04:39,508 --> 00:04:40,918
Anyways...

38
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:45,414
- Hertha Von Pfeil.
- Is your father a general?

39
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:48,300
No, insurance sales agent.

40
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:49,752
Well...

41
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:57,665
- How old are you?
- I'm almost 16.

42
00:04:57,883 --> 00:05:00,289
Golly! That's impressive!
What about your father?

43
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:04,881
Johannes Kopp, born Tressler.
It's my mother, errr, my father...

44
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:08,501
Don't be overawed.
I don't bite.

45
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:10,375
Quite the contrary.

46
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:12,831
Let's cut to the heart and get to
your comrades' offering.

47
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,585
A pound of hard wheat,
and a pound of rye wheat.

48
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,257
Come and get it.

49
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:22,253
I have a few pennants spare
to brighten your farewell party.

50
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:25,832
They're in my car.
Don't push around.

51
00:06:00,675 --> 00:06:02,168
Madam.

52
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:06,998
Same thing here.
Cold potatoes and sauerkraut.

53
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:10,380
What? Potatoes
and sauerkraut again?

54
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:12,547
You sure got some nerve!

55
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:17,130
A portion of potatoes
and sauerkraut!

56
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:22,461
My comrade got his call-up.

57
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:24,002
Let me buy you a drink.

58
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,958
That's on me.

59
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:28,249
What's your name?

60
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:30,920
Back off, ship boy!

61
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,540
- Where's Lucy?
- Upstairs.

62
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:24,756
Ouch! Are you mad?

63
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:28,379
Willi! Serves you right!

64
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:32,502
I don't like to be groped like that.
Where were you?

65
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:35,419
Look, it bleeds!

66
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:38,003
Such a crybaby!
It's just a little scratch.

67
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:42,163
I feared it might be the old man.
With his crone being on a trip and all.

68
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,504
- Are you finished?
- Not here. If the boss...

69
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:49,129
- Trude will soon be on duty.
- I have a nice present for you.

70
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:52,589
All right! I'll come Afterwards.
But don't make any noise.

71
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:10,507
- Check.
- That's 2, 80 marks.

72
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:19,628
90, three, four...

73
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:22,875
- Where could I make a phone call?
- Across the street, at the baker's.

74
00:08:23,092 --> 00:08:26,090
And five. How was the food?

75
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,206
You call that a tip?

76
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:50,631
Are you outta your mind?

77
00:08:50,842 --> 00:08:53,211
You want to pay for this bottle?

78
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:55,960
We're in short supply these days.

79
00:09:12,525 --> 00:09:15,309
24, 25,

80
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:18,150
26, 27...

81
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,439
31.

82
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,440
Alarm.

83
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,057
There should be 32 in all.

84
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:35,107
Why all the bits and pieces?
Why didn't they give you just a slice?

85
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:37,565
Bacon's bacon, no matter what.

86
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:42,139
Here's looking to you:
32 proofs of gratitude.

87
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:46,102
Willi Keun,
he's not just anyone.

88
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:48,807
All for one...

89
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,764
Lucy...

90
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:57,439
If I still had
my left thumb,

91
00:09:57,775 --> 00:10:00,690
I'd go on the front as soon as tomorrow.

92
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,558
You? Thanks for the good laugh!

93
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:06,514
Do you remember Klaus, the guy
who worked at the counter?

94
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:10,348
Yes, that's my friend, Klaus Schmides.
I envy him.

95
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,853
That's what I call a real soldier.

96
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,899
He was. He's dead now.

97
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,389
He's fallen on the battlefield.
What do you say about that, huh!?

98
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,771
Fallen? Maybe...

99
00:10:23,317 --> 00:10:26,398
But for the Fuhrer
and the people's sake.

100
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:31,100
"Our grief shall be pride, Emmi. "
You gotta be out of your mind, Willi.

101
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:35,014
How are we supposed to go on like this
without supplies, without income?

102
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,520
I didn't get any tips today.

103
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:40,601
Tips!

104
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:43,270
North to south and east to west

105
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:45,806
soldiers fight for the Reich's survival
and...

106
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:49,438
And you're right in the middle of it,
including 32 slices of bacon!

107
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,311
Don't tell me fibs.
You shouldn't show off like that.

108
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:54,555
What? Why me?

109
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:58,306
You're not complying with the Nazis.
A family, for instance?

110
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:02,768
"The family is the nation's rampart",
so said Adolf Hitler.

111
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:04,810
All right...

112
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:07,181
I'm married, but...

113
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:10,893
We already discussed this, Lucy...

114
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:14,399
My wife,
she can't bear children of her own.

115
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:18,285
That's crazy! You want me to bear
your children instead of her?

116
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:20,017
Great sense of humor!

117
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:24,097
That's not what I meant. After all,
we've been only together for a day.

118
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:29,233
- My sweet little whale.
- My goodness!

119
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:33,518
All that fancy talking of yours,
makes me feel sick.

120
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:36,352
- Take a schnaps.
- No!

121
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:40,680
I'm dying for something sweet.

122
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,521
Fruit cans.

123
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:45,692
Excuse-me for a moment.

124
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:49,650
There are some spare mason jars
with cherries hidden in the stroller.

125
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,738
In the stroller?

126
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:54,722
I had to! The city block's captain
is nothing but a low-down thief.

127
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:58,274
I hid all my sweets in my old stroller,

128
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:02,567
right under the stairs to the cellar.
No one will take 'em away from me.

129
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:07,057
We fight for the Reich's survival

130
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:09,963
and this girl stuffs
herself with morello cherries!

131
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,591
Alarm!

132
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:22,872
Alarm!

133
00:13:25,883 --> 00:13:28,751
Lucy, what the hell are you up to?

134
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:40,921
Are you done with your cherries now?

135
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,585
- We're not taking this porcelain tiger!
- Yes, we are!

136
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:11,250
Get a grip!
It's just like every other night.

137
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,955
- They're just above our heads.
- Speed up! Alarm!

138
00:14:14,175 --> 00:14:17,623
Quick! Hurry up!

139
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:20,779
Run to the cellar! Alarm!

140
00:14:29,383 --> 00:14:31,670
Mrs. Hansen!
Quick, to the cellar, there's...

141
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,039
They're coming down on us,
captain.

142
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,754
A Gestapo hot shot is there.
Sparks will fly.

143
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:12,378
Come in.

144
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:17,376
Am I interrupting anything?

145
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:22,914
Far from that. I was just expecting
someone from the Gestapo.

146
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:25,466
Come!

147
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:33,708
I'm delighted.
Take a seat, Kersten.

148
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:36,548
Let's hope it won't cave in.

149
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:39,041
Let's hope so.

150
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,209
How's your leg?

151
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:44,083
I can't complain.

152
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,835
I still need to get treatment.

153
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,083
It's quite convenient to have
a shrapnel in the knee!

154
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:54,040
You seem to have fulfilled
your hunger for heroic deeds.

155
00:16:55,092 --> 00:16:58,706
Most of all, I'm not too keen on seeing
our Russian "brothers" again.

156
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:00,548
The Russians,
they're tough as nails.

157
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:02,168
Obviously!

158
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:06,876
I agreed on your transfer
to my department.

159
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,917
I'm very grateful for that.

160
00:17:09,758 --> 00:17:12,460
You're quite happy
to be back in Berlin, huh?

161
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:15,923
I've seen way too many horrible things
on the eastern front.

162
00:17:16,342 --> 00:17:19,008
Besides, the Homicide Department
seems to be a peaceful place.

163
00:17:19,217 --> 00:17:21,586
My motto now
is duck and kowtow.

164
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,375
I can't blame you for that.
Kersten, you have no idea.

165
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:30,631
This world's a pitiful and absurd one.

166
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,090
Every day, thousands of soldiers
die on the front and I'm heading

167
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,547
a huge bureaucratic hellhole,
investigating only a few criminal cases.

168
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:41,500
For instance, a certain Willi Keun

169
00:17:41,717 --> 00:17:44,880
has strangled a waitress in Hamburg.
It's all over the papers.

170
00:17:45,092 --> 00:17:47,129
But when thousands of soldiers

171
00:17:47,342 --> 00:17:50,044
get killed on the front,
the headlines say:

172
00:17:50,258 --> 00:17:52,711
"Our losses are insignificant. "

173
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:56,039
This guy must have an iron fist.

174
00:17:56,258 --> 00:18:00,334
There was a similar case 2 or 3 years ago.
Unsolved if memory serves me right.

175
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:02,216
That could be a case for you!

176
00:18:02,842 --> 00:18:04,039
For me?

177
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:07,038
Certainly not! Our colleagues
in Hamburg should deal with it.

178
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:12,581
Inspector, you seem to have
overlooked a few details.

179
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,966
Let's fix it fast and let's avoid
the Gruppenfuhrer's wrath.

180
00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:19,166
You're quite a joker.

181
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:22,581
How dare you drag a SS
in front of your shitty civil court!

182
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:24,300
This man committed a crime...

183
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,291
A crime? Give me a break!

184
00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:29,508
Besides we're the only ones
to have the power to judge this case.

185
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:33,050
The guy got drunk
and didn't behave himself, I agree.

186
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:34,460
But he was on the front.

187
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,127
And he came back with all honors.

188
00:18:36,342 --> 00:18:38,083
The court will take that into account.

189
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,748
And he almost killed a man.
The wounded survived...

190
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:43,874
So what! A foreigner anyhow!

191
00:18:44,217 --> 00:18:46,207
They think they can
get away with everything.

192
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,294
You don't understand our times.

193
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,205
But I'm a member of the party.

194
00:18:52,425 --> 00:18:54,665
He improved himself a lot.

195
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,789
Who are you?
Don't mind me by the way!

196
00:18:59,383 --> 00:19:01,374
I wasn't going to stand up.

197
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,256
This is inspector Kersten. He's been
discharged from the military hospital.

198
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:08,753
He served as a Battalion Commander.

199
00:19:09,217 --> 00:19:11,835
No, I only served
as a Company Commander.

200
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:15,793
Why the "only"?

201
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:19,628
I knew a few officers that were
somehow smarter than generals.

202
00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:22,211
Mr Kersten's under my command now.

203
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:24,341
Very well.

204
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:28,340
I'm looking forward to working with you.
My name's Mollwitz.

205
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,126
Central security service.

206
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:33,838
We insist upon a faultless exchange
with the Homicide Department.

207
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,171
We're all in the same boat, aren't we?

208
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,251
Comrade Bohm, I trust you to find
an acceptable solution

209
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,753
in this matter.

210
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:44,206
It won't be easy.

211
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:47,257
Put more effort to it then.
Have a nice lunch!

212
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,751
Maybe I should follow your motto.
Duck and kowtow.

213
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:01,415
But I'm wondering
If we'll get used to it, in the end.

214
00:20:01,925 --> 00:20:03,418
I certainly will.

215
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:07,081
It was kind of tense back there.
Be careful!

216
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,748
Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's.

217
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,459
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

218
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:33,211
Mrs Paschke,
a pack of cigarettes, please.

219
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:35,546
Without coupons?
Sweet Jesus, Miss Hornung!

220
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:39,503
You know I'm accountable for that.
I sure don't want any trouble here!

221
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:45,457
- Let me help you with that.
- Don't bother.

222
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,829
Hold on!

223
00:20:50,592 --> 00:20:52,713
Is that trick fully tried and tested?

224
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:57,049
I planned to open an umbrella shop.
Oddly enough, this summer's quite dry.

225
00:20:57,258 --> 00:20:59,048
All right. All right.

226
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:12,631
Do you mind if I keep you company?

227
00:21:15,383 --> 00:21:18,500
Miss, is this a large German beef-steak?

228
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:21,170
As big and large
as the Great Germany?

229
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:24,583
You bet!
That's Ukrainian horse-meat.

230
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:29,704
Silence! Wehrmacht bulletin!

231
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:36,295
<i>Here, the general staff of the Wehrmacht:</i>

232
00:21:37,508 --> 00:21:41,004
<i>American bombers
have crossed the Reich's borders</i>

233
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:46,372
<i>and attacked West and South Germany. </i>

234
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:49,708
<i>In the residential districts of
Munich, Mannheim</i>

235
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,999
<i>and Karlsruhe,
we suffered important damages. </i>

236
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:54,540
What about here in Berlin?

237
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:01,894
Here. Won't use it. I'm a nonsmoker.

238
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,679
That's what I call
a perfectly good timing.

239
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:07,143
- What about your wife? Your friends?
- Friends?

240
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:10,890
Who's got any friends these days?
Help yourself.

241
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:14,890
- Too proud?
- No, just suspicious.

242
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:17,352
Mrs Pashke, cigarettes!

243
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:21,649
Don't mind if I'm curious. I work
at the Criminal Investigation Department.

244
00:22:22,192 --> 00:22:25,190
I thought you were
an apprentice in upholstery.

245
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,971
Is that some sort of disguise?
How cunning!

246
00:22:28,192 --> 00:22:31,604
My name's Kersten.
I work with Bohm.

247
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,891
You don't say!
You're an inspector?

248
00:22:34,108 --> 00:22:35,352
Yes. Who did you think I was?

249
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:37,439
A civilian general, maybe.

250
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,816
You do have a low opinion of me!
Thanks.

251
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:43,434
What are you going to do
with this stuff?

252
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,107
You're gonna laugh:
I'm going to wallpaper.

253
00:22:45,317 --> 00:22:50,021
I'll be on my own though. Berlin's
finest upholsterers are on the front.

254
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:53,226
In case you're running out of glue...

255
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:56,434
Spoiled child, eh?

256
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,024
You don't even have an idea.

257
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:00,722
By the way, I do know a upholsterer.

258
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:04,142
A great craftsman.
But he only works on Sundays.

259
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:07,853
Undeclared work, you understand?

260
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:09,939
Give me the address.
I'll send him over to you.

261
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,769
That'd be lovely.
Let me write it down.

262
00:23:14,775 --> 00:23:15,889
Helga Hornung,

263
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:17,731
Weberstrasse 14.

264
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:20,644
- Is he reliable?
- Quite.

265
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,264
He's difficult to live with, a loner.

266
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:27,808
I won't marry him. All he has to do
is to wallpaper and bring a stool.

267
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,935
Cigarettes.

268
00:23:41,858 --> 00:23:43,055
A friend of yours?

269
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:46,557
Not yet.
But he might be someday.

270
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:51,231
We still have common interests with
the Central security service, don't we?

271
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:53,597
Possible.

272
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:09,305
Hey, Anna.

273
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:16,731
- Anna...
- Hi, Bruno.

274
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,055
Is that how you walk around?

275
00:24:21,358 --> 00:24:23,479
Where were you all the time?

276
00:24:23,692 --> 00:24:25,599
I was at the Obligatory Work Service.

277
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:29,023
- I gained some weight, eh?
- I don't think so.

278
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:32,599
Are you going to stay here now?
Are you going to the dance with me?

279
00:24:32,817 --> 00:24:36,182
We'll see about that. I just arrived!

280
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:39,434
- Those suitcases nearly finished me off.
- Those little things?

281
00:24:42,442 --> 00:24:45,223
- I'll take care of it.
- That's sweet, Bruno.

282
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:50,225
How are you Bruno?
Are you making a living now?

283
00:24:50,442 --> 00:24:54,056
I'm doing fine. I know how to earn
potatoes and schnaps.

284
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:56,680
But your father is such a cheapskate...

285
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,476
- And I often go abroad.
- abroad?

286
00:24:58,692 --> 00:25:01,015
- To Bamberg.
- What are you doing there?

287
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:05,357
Sometimes I'm going to Hamburg, Kassel.
Truck drivers give me a lift.

288
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,188
And with the money I make, I buy
potatoes, schnaps, cigarettes.

289
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,023
Thanks a lot, Bruno.

290
00:25:30,025 --> 00:25:32,430
When are you going to the dance
with me?

291
00:25:32,858 --> 00:25:36,354
I don't know yet.
I have a lot of work on my plate.

292
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:41,105
I'm completing a nursing apprenticeship
at the Red Cross hospital.

293
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:44,560
Where's the
Red Cross hospital?

294
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:46,398
It's in the Wedding quarter.

295
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,473
I know Wedding inside out.

296
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,955
Excuse-me,
WeberstrassYe 14?

297
00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:08,331
It's just next door.
The number plate fell.

298
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:12,295
- Darn those bombs!
- Bombs in Berlin? No way!

299
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:15,044
The latest news
made the plate grow wary.

300
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:16,289
Thanks.

301
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:21,331
I'm bitterly disappointed.

302
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:25,958
I come all the way here to flirt nicely
and now you got an upholsterer already.

303
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,173
I don't flirt
with my next of kin.

304
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:35,543
Tell me at least what you're up to
with your bottle?

305
00:26:35,758 --> 00:26:39,455
That's the upholsterer's wage.
Stop it. You've had enough already.

306
00:26:39,675 --> 00:26:42,756
I barely started.

307
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:45,336
Our Fuhrer needs heroes, you know.

308
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,378
A true hero is either a total drunk,
or stupid as cabbage.

309
00:26:49,592 --> 00:26:53,632
And I certainly don't want to
let our beloved Fuhrer down...

310
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,965
Thomas, get a grip on yourself.
I don't know that man.

311
00:26:57,175 --> 00:27:00,292
You don't know him, and yet you're ready
to offer him some schnaps?

312
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:13,796
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

313
00:27:17,258 --> 00:27:20,375
I didn't know
you were expecting someone.

314
00:27:20,592 --> 00:27:23,543
I hope you don't mind if I mess up
your place more than it is already?

315
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:25,085
No, no.

316
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,713
Thomas, this is the man
who claims to be an upholsterer.

317
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:31,589
This is commanding officer Wollenberg.

318
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,625
Welcome to you!

319
00:27:33,842 --> 00:27:38,878
I hope my mere presence won't
be detrimental to your art, master.

320
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:43,584
I don't think so. It's the first time
that I lay out paper on a wall.

321
00:27:43,925 --> 00:27:47,172
Thumbs up!
Germany's in dire need of brave men.

322
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:51,585
M. Kersten is an inspector
at the Homicide Department.

323
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,956
On Sundays,
he's working under the table.

324
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:57,872
You could have told me that you were
the loner.

325
00:27:58,092 --> 00:28:00,710
I would have spared the bottle.

326
00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:02,293
How come you didn't guess it?

327
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:05,123
I thought you were working
at the Criminal Affairs department!

328
00:28:05,342 --> 00:28:08,542
I'm not very gifted.
I work at the Central Records Division.

329
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:12,455
Which means this bottle is of no use,
so to speak.

330
00:28:13,383 --> 00:28:18,206
I suggest to raise our glasses
to our beloved Fuhrer

331
00:28:18,425 --> 00:28:20,878
and to his inevitable final victory.

332
00:28:21,258 --> 00:28:24,007
Honey, did you wash
the glasses we used this evening?

333
00:28:24,717 --> 00:28:26,672
Don't get too cheeky.

334
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:28,673
They're right over there.

335
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:31,580
Did you invite him

336
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,047
to protect yourself or did you mean
to provoke me?

337
00:28:35,258 --> 00:28:36,917
Mr Wollenberg is my cousin.

338
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,500
Fourth cousin!

339
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:43,129
His grandmother was the cousin
of my mother's aunt.

340
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,956
Good luck!

341
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:50,628
I wasn't referring
to the tapestry.

342
00:28:51,258 --> 00:28:52,289
What were your referring to then?

343
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:55,181
My angel, did you invite this gentleman

344
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:58,392
to protect yourself from me
or did you just mean to provoke me?

345
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:02,225
All right, all ready. Let's get it on.

346
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:06,733
Since my wound requires that I glue
the bottom part of the wall, I suggest

347
00:29:06,858 --> 00:29:10,473
you take the upper part, officer.
Which leaves the middle to Miss Hornung.

348
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:12,184
Why me?

349
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:16,566
I'm a cousin and a pilot, so be it.
By no means, I'll be an upholsterer.

350
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:18,766
But I'll take care of the schnaps.

351
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:20,690
I thought so.

352
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,190
Schnaps is any cousins, aviators
or upholsterers' favorite beverage.

353
00:29:25,817 --> 00:29:29,396
In these heroic times,
it should be everybody's beverage.

354
00:29:29,608 --> 00:29:31,184
It gives you wings.

355
00:29:34,842 --> 00:29:37,544
A Missing persons notice
under the wallpaper?

356
00:29:38,425 --> 00:29:40,960
I guess my job sticks to me.

357
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,330
Did I say something funny?

358
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,047
Yes, a murder.
Are you interested?

359
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:50,418
Why not?
Entertain us a bit.

360
00:29:52,217 --> 00:29:56,257
"On the night of September 23, 1937

361
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:58,250
"Vera Fenner, 38 years old,
was slayed by an unknown man"

362
00:29:58,425 --> 00:30:02,040
"in a woodland near Hagenow. "

363
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,217
Thank God,
I've a rock-solid alibi for that day.

364
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:09,497
"The victim died as a result of
the hyoid bone's fracture. "

365
00:30:10,217 --> 00:30:13,582
Heavens! This sounds like an athlete
with giant hands.

366
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,799
That's weird!
Somehow it rings a bell...

367
00:30:17,008 --> 00:30:19,793
There's been a similar a case
in Hamburg not so long ago.

368
00:30:20,008 --> 00:30:21,798
No matter.
That's none of my business.

369
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:24,711
Any other subject we might talk about?

370
00:30:25,508 --> 00:30:27,001
Yes, yes.

371
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:31,333
What do you think about love?

372
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:43,599
Potatoes for Lehmann!

373
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:46,641
Second floor,
but there's nobody home.

374
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,339
- Well, I leave 'em here then.
- No, you certainly won't.

375
00:30:49,517 --> 00:30:52,889
Or they'll stay here
till the next harvest.

376
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:57,381
Look, Mr Lehmann is too weak a man
and the lady has tuberculosis.

377
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:00,715
Well, I was paid to make the delivery
and I'm a man of my word.

378
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:04,348
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

379
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:09,048
Go upstairs and ring the bell.
Three long and two short ringtones.

380
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,933
Maybe they'll open up.

381
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:13,886
Wait!

382
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:17,215
You certainly didn't hear it from me...

383
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:19,548
Three long, two short.

384
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,722
I'm delivering the potatoes.

385
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,468
The potatoes... Very well.

386
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,222
Thanks a lot.

387
00:32:17,975 --> 00:32:19,468
Should I leave them here?

388
00:32:20,183 --> 00:32:21,557
Excuse me...

389
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:26,047
Would you be so kind to carry
the potato sack to the kitchen?

390
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:32,553
Right over there.

391
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:48,509
It's hot, isn't it?

392
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:52,884
I'm hungry. Those ration coupons
are barely enough.

393
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,257
Can I fix you a sandwich?

394
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,513
I reckon I wouldn't say no,
Mrs. Lehmann.

395
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,266
You're welcome.

396
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,422
I've had enough of it.
Too much work and nothing to eat.

397
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:18,722
I prefer to roam the roads.
I like the countryside.

398
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:20,675
I'm leaving next week.

399
00:33:20,892 --> 00:33:22,171
You're going on a trip?

400
00:33:22,392 --> 00:33:24,797
Yes, I'm leaving with the truck drivers.

401
00:33:25,142 --> 00:33:27,808
As a back-seat driver?

402
00:33:28,017 --> 00:33:29,723
And where do you go?

403
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:32,345
- All kinds of places.
- Everywhere?

404
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:36,971
You think
they could take me along?

405
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,341
I'd do anything to get out of here.

406
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:42,509
Yes, there's enough room
in those big trucks.

407
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:45,057
Is that true?

408
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:49,469
There's something I gotta tell you.

409
00:33:50,017 --> 00:33:54,473
I'm not the real Mrs Lehmann.
I'm just a guest.

410
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,256
But please sit down, mister...

411
00:33:57,475 --> 00:33:58,636
Bruno.

412
00:34:01,975 --> 00:34:03,254
I'm not bothering you?

413
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,300
No, I'm all on my own.

414
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,552
I'm happy
when I have some company.

415
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:10,801
Always alone.

416
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,517
Yes, ever since my husband passed away.

417
00:34:16,308 --> 00:34:17,718
Damn the war...

418
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:22,549
My husband died in Auschwitz.

419
00:34:23,558 --> 00:34:24,636
Never heard of it.

420
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:29,633
He was a doctor.
Professor Weinberger.

421
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:32,216
Does the name ring a bell?

422
00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:35,135
No.
I never get sick.

423
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,055
So you're always alone?

424
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:42,885
Let me fix you
something to eat, all right?

425
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:47,264
I didn't know where to go.
I'm Jewish...

426
00:35:48,017 --> 00:35:50,552
But the Lehmanns
were very kind with me.

427
00:35:50,767 --> 00:35:53,053
And not just because they needed
the money to pay their debts.

428
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:55,506
They're really good people.

429
00:35:55,725 --> 00:36:00,098
But because of me, they have taken
too many risks. I have to leave.

430
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,223
Where are the Lehmanns now?

431
00:36:02,433 --> 00:36:06,557
He's working at Siemens
and she's on duty at the Post office.

432
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:08,343
They're coming in late then?

433
00:36:08,558 --> 00:36:12,090
Rarely before 10 pm.
Of course, they're beat.

434
00:36:12,308 --> 00:36:15,555
I'm so happy
to talk to someone.

435
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:18,006
I can't go out
for a walk.

436
00:36:18,558 --> 00:36:20,964
Always alone...
Aren't you afraid?

437
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:26,219
Yes, I'm always afraid.

438
00:36:27,392 --> 00:36:31,089
Less so by death
than by the abasement.

439
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,757
I heard terrible rumors.

440
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,305
Why are people
so cruel?

441
00:36:38,392 --> 00:36:41,176
Beats me.
I have a few worries of my own.

442
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,930
Maybe I'm afraid to die after all.
I don't know.

443
00:36:47,142 --> 00:36:50,970
I'm not that old.
How old do you think I am?

444
00:36:52,683 --> 00:36:54,970
I don't have a clue.
Around forty, fifty.

445
00:36:56,558 --> 00:36:58,763
Do I look that old?

446
00:37:08,183 --> 00:37:10,091
The last few years were...

447
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,007
I was such a beautiful woman...

448
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:17,256
My husband loved my hair.

449
00:37:18,058 --> 00:37:21,009
Look what they became?
No hairdresser, no soap.

450
00:37:24,517 --> 00:37:25,796
My God!

451
00:37:26,017 --> 00:37:28,470
It's me. Mrs. Lehmann!

452
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:30,891
Mrs. Lehmann!

453
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:32,973
I didn't lock the door.

454
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:34,630
Or maybe I did?

455
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:36,464
Did you lock the door?

456
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:38,885
Me? Why are you asking?

457
00:37:41,233 --> 00:37:43,639
I guess I'm the one to blame.
I leave in constant fear.

458
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:46,311
I guess it just comes to me naturally.
I beg your pardon.

459
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:48,231
I'm coming, Mrs. Lehmann!

460
00:38:01,525 --> 00:38:04,772
This is Mr Bruno.
He brought the potatoes.

461
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,227
How come you're home so early?

462
00:38:06,442 --> 00:38:09,642
A shell fell on the central office.
They're repairing the roof.

463
00:38:09,858 --> 00:38:12,429
I'm gonna sleep in late
tomorrow.

464
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,104
- Thanks for the sandwiches.
- You're welcome.

465
00:38:25,317 --> 00:38:27,722
If you're in the neighborhood,
don't forget:

466
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:31,105
three long ringtones,
two short.

467
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:33,978
I'm pleased to have visitors.

468
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:37,308
And think about the truck.

469
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:39,599
If there's any opportunity...

470
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:41,722
Please...

471
00:38:53,142 --> 00:38:54,800
But why?

472
00:38:55,475 --> 00:38:57,181
Why would I kill her?

473
00:38:57,392 --> 00:39:00,473
She was my girlfriend.
I couldn't say no to her.

474
00:39:00,683 --> 00:39:03,634
I had a few drinks all right
but I know where to draw the line.

475
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:07,974
I'm not a violent man, counsellor.
I've never beaten my wife.

476
00:39:09,392 --> 00:39:12,674
As to the missing bacon,
I'll make up to it.

477
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,558
Even we may give in to temptation.

478
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:17,094
Always on duty!

479
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:21,889
You must mention that,
consellor.

480
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,221
I've been decorated
with the Cross of War.

481
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:26,756
- When do I get out?
- Get out?

482
00:39:26,975 --> 00:39:30,506
You don't get it, do you?
Your life's at stake here.

483
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:34,306
I suggest to plea for "crime of passion
committed in a state of inebriation".

484
00:39:34,517 --> 00:39:36,009
You don't remember
anything that happened.

485
00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:40,516
I remember every single thing!
I walked out into the hallway...

486
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:43,593
Lucy went to the stroller
to take her morello cherries.

487
00:39:43,808 --> 00:39:45,515
Morello cherries? Stroller?

488
00:39:45,725 --> 00:39:48,048
Do you mean to plea insanity
in your defense?

489
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:50,471
Don't think you can fool those judges
that easily!

490
00:39:50,683 --> 00:39:53,598
But the story with the cherries,
that's in the file.

491
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,135
Didn't you read it?

492
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:56,932
Briefly.

493
00:39:58,183 --> 00:40:01,265
But you should
know my file inside out!

494
00:40:01,475 --> 00:40:02,636
You're my counsel!

495
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,508
Court-appointed counsel.

496
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:07,422
But you need to know everything!

497
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,757
It all started with the celebration.

498
00:40:16,642 --> 00:40:18,514
A harvest celebration.

499
00:40:18,725 --> 00:40:21,178
I'm always doing one when the girls
have accomplished their service.

500
00:40:21,392 --> 00:40:23,015
By chance, I met Lucy again.

501
00:40:23,225 --> 00:40:25,511
- By chance?
- Not really. I came to pick her up.

502
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:29,844
I went at her place and we had a drink.

503
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:33,431
- And you argued?
- Not at all, counsellor. Not at all.

504
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:37,221
We talked about the country's situation
and we disagreed, that's all.

505
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:39,092
What about those scratches on her hand?

506
00:40:39,558 --> 00:40:41,715
These are struggle marks.

507
00:40:41,933 --> 00:40:44,552
Come on!
The court won't buy your story!

508
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:47,386
I don't believe it either! There's enough
evidence to send you to the gallows.

509
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:50,552
Well, we're not quite there yet.
Tell me.

510
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:53,599
What happened to your thumb?
Can I take a look?

511
00:40:53,808 --> 00:40:56,048
I sawed it off when
I was a child.

512
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:59,181
The very reason of my misfortune
I volunteered 4 times!

513
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,719
Can I take a look at your other hand?

514
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,303
That's a flaccid hand you got there.
Don't you play any sports?

515
00:41:07,517 --> 00:41:11,178
I suffered from cardiac insufficiency.
After that, I never got around to it.

516
00:41:11,392 --> 00:41:14,639
I think the public prosecutor
didn't kill himself over this case.

517
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:19,383
He doesn't believe me!
My own lawyer doesn't believe me!

518
00:41:19,892 --> 00:41:22,843
How can you defend me
if you don't believe me?

519
00:41:23,058 --> 00:41:24,966
That's up to me!

520
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:28,631
With any luck, you might benefit from
mitigating circumstances.

521
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,259
I dismiss you.

522
00:41:30,475 --> 00:41:33,556
My lawyer has to believe
in my innocence.

523
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:36,634
That's insane!
I'm a member of the party.

524
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:39,090
I sacrificed myself for the Fuhrer.

525
00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:40,801
Get off your high horses.

526
00:41:41,017 --> 00:41:44,015
Above all, don't mention the party
during the trial.

527
00:41:44,225 --> 00:41:45,931
They'll most likely take you
down a peg.

528
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:50,301
Well, Keun, think it over.
I'll be back tomorrow.

529
00:41:50,517 --> 00:41:53,965
That's still mister Keun to you.
Mark my words!

530
00:41:56,475 --> 00:41:57,636
Mister Keun...

531
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,346
I don't think you're guilty.

532
00:42:42,058 --> 00:42:43,800
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Miss Helga.

533
00:42:44,017 --> 00:42:46,340
- Come in, please.
- Thank you.

534
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:54,260
Gee, it's so dark in here!
Anything wrong with those light bulbs?

535
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:55,929
No.

536
00:42:56,142 --> 00:42:59,507
It's just that I like candlelight.
And it's the perfect thing

537
00:42:59,725 --> 00:43:01,881
to mark special occasions.

538
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,386
Don't tell me you're celebrating
your birthday!

539
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,598
No, but I'm expecting a
very friendly guest.

540
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:12,346
That blond provocateur with the
Knight's cross? What's his name again?

541
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:17,348
Thomas Wollenberg. He's my cousin.
How many times do I have to tell you!

542
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,718
I actually meant to say
that you're the friendly guest.

543
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:24,264
How nice of you.
I guess I don't really deserve this.

544
00:43:24,475 --> 00:43:26,845
Can I switch on the light for a second?

545
00:43:27,058 --> 00:43:29,725
Just a minute.
I'm gonna turn it off right away.

546
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:33,593
Don't you want to eat?
It's getting cold.

547
00:43:33,933 --> 00:43:35,640
Sure, right away.

548
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:37,880
What are you doing over there?

549
00:43:38,933 --> 00:43:40,924
It peels off easily.

550
00:43:41,142 --> 00:43:42,634
What peels off?

551
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:45,718
The wallpaper.
Tell me, Miss Helga...

552
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:49,590
Do you have a spare fragment of paper,
about this size?

553
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:53,346
- No. What for?
- Just in case you need to paper the wall.

554
00:43:54,308 --> 00:43:56,797
If memory serves me right,

555
00:43:57,017 --> 00:43:59,138
there's a piece of evidence,

556
00:44:00,267 --> 00:44:02,341
right there.

557
00:44:02,558 --> 00:44:05,047
- Now turned into under-layer.
- Good appetite.

558
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,724
Good appetite.

559
00:44:08,392 --> 00:44:11,923
Don't you remember?
The old missing person notice.

560
00:44:12,142 --> 00:44:14,381
The country girl from Hagenow.

561
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,761
No.

562
00:44:16,683 --> 00:44:17,845
I do.

563
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:22,634
Right here.

564
00:44:28,308 --> 00:44:30,180
What are you doing?

565
00:44:31,017 --> 00:44:34,429
Here goes your wallpaper
and my good resolutions.

566
00:44:40,475 --> 00:44:42,300
The wolf has killed
and will kill again.

567
00:44:43,642 --> 00:44:46,474
I'm hunting down a serial killer,
still at large.

568
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:48,093
You're really obsessed!

569
00:44:48,308 --> 00:44:51,721
If you ask me,
he's this century's greatest monster.

570
00:44:51,933 --> 00:44:54,801
And you're the hunter?
Before, you satisfied yourself

571
00:44:55,017 --> 00:44:58,429
- with dusty files.
- That's true.

572
00:44:58,642 --> 00:45:02,718
But there's a suspect in Hamburg,
whose neck is already in the noose.

573
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,098
Now, maybe he's guilty
and maybe he isn't.

574
00:45:07,433 --> 00:45:09,009
But he has only one life to live.

575
00:45:09,225 --> 00:45:11,180
I do care about that.

576
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,681
"September 1937. "

577
00:45:13,892 --> 00:45:14,804
Let's see.

578
00:45:14,975 --> 00:45:17,926
- Should I heat the tea pot?
- No need for that. I'm almost through.

579
00:45:21,142 --> 00:45:24,922
Vera Wenner or Fenner, whatever.

580
00:45:25,142 --> 00:45:26,551
There it is.

581
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:30,256
"Died as a result of
the fracture of the hyoid bone,

582
00:45:30,433 --> 00:45:32,175
"suffocating"

583
00:45:33,808 --> 00:45:35,349
I have a memory like an elephant!

584
00:45:36,183 --> 00:45:37,842
That's the 5th case so far.

585
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,141
What do you say now?

586
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:42,841
Nothing. The wallpaper is bust

587
00:45:43,058 --> 00:45:46,389
and I don't like the turn of events.

588
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,882
I don't know why exactly.
I sort of hoped you'd let it go.

589
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,593
And I don't talk about the wallpaper.

590
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:54,590
I'll buy you a nice painting.

591
00:45:54,767 --> 00:45:57,172
A funny little whatsit with the Fuhrer.

592
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,257
Don't bother.

593
00:45:59,725 --> 00:46:02,889
Look, I'm sorry,
but it was important to me.

594
00:46:03,058 --> 00:46:03,971
Sure enough.

595
00:46:06,058 --> 00:46:08,263
How lovely.

596
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:11,426
And all those delicacies!
Just like the in the good old days.

597
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:15,630
I think I'm going to turn the lights out
now.

598
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:18,006
Leave it be,
we'll see better like this anyway.

599
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,885
Probably but candlelight is far lovelier

600
00:46:28,558 --> 00:46:31,011
and fits special occasions better.

601
00:46:31,725 --> 00:46:32,922
Are you angry with me?

602
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:38,011
I guess I lost my manners.
You should invite me more often.

603
00:46:38,225 --> 00:46:41,673
Somehow, I have the impression,
you feel already at home.

604
00:46:42,058 --> 00:46:43,599
Wouldn't you like that?

605
00:46:43,808 --> 00:46:47,636
Only if you don't ruin
my furniture and my wallpaper.

606
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:51,225
Sit down at last!

607
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,579
At your command!

608
00:47:39,517 --> 00:47:40,767
Leave me alone!

609
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:46,808
Bruno's a tard, Bruno's a tard...

610
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:15,642
- How nice of you to come by.
- What was all that racket about?

611
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,663
Children stuff.
Sit down.

612
00:48:18,871 --> 00:48:21,640
Bruno, I'm in a rush.
I have to go upstairs.

613
00:48:21,892 --> 00:48:23,598
Why? Your father's not there.

614
00:48:23,808 --> 00:48:25,882
I've got some work to do.

615
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,138
Besides, I've got nothing to do here.

616
00:48:29,642 --> 00:48:31,549
What's that vest?

617
00:48:33,267 --> 00:48:35,636
Well, a vest, that's what it is.

618
00:48:36,267 --> 00:48:37,345
It's a gift.

619
00:48:37,558 --> 00:48:41,138
Don't tell me fibs.
That's a woman's vest.

620
00:48:42,808 --> 00:48:46,008
Bruno, Bruno!
Are you're seeing a lady?

621
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:49,885
Don't let my father know about it!

622
00:48:50,225 --> 00:48:53,555
- Here, take it.
- No, thanks, Bruno.

623
00:48:57,683 --> 00:49:00,219
We can go on a date now, look!

624
00:49:01,142 --> 00:49:04,223
- Where did you get that?
- I found it on the streets.

625
00:49:04,433 --> 00:49:07,266
You have to give it back!

626
00:49:07,475 --> 00:49:09,845
I found it, it's mine.

627
00:49:10,058 --> 00:49:12,926
It's not yours.
You have to give it to the police.

628
00:49:13,142 --> 00:49:15,298
You know what? Damn the police.

629
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:19,013
I'll go with you just to make sure
you're really giving it back.

630
00:49:19,225 --> 00:49:21,132
Somebody has lost it and
must be desperate now!

631
00:49:23,058 --> 00:49:24,255
I don't think so.

632
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,005
It doesn't matter what you think.

633
00:49:27,225 --> 00:49:29,097
You've always been an honest guy.

634
00:49:29,308 --> 00:49:34,049
Sure, but there's almost 300 marks,
a pretty nice sum to get out on a date.

635
00:49:34,267 --> 00:49:36,139
We can go out for less than 300 marks.

636
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:37,926
Let's go to the police station.
And that's final.

637
00:49:40,058 --> 00:49:41,717
Stay here.

638
00:49:42,725 --> 00:49:44,716
Wouldn't you like that.
Want to get cozy, eh?

639
00:49:46,392 --> 00:49:48,880
Come on, take the purse
and let's go.

640
00:49:52,808 --> 00:49:53,638
Come on!

641
00:50:14,517 --> 00:50:16,554
Thank you, sergeant.

642
00:50:24,725 --> 00:50:26,632
<i>- Hello.
- Heil Hitler!</i>

643
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:29,677
Miss Hohmann,
did Bruno give you hard time?

644
00:50:29,892 --> 00:50:32,215
No, Mr. Ludke has found a purse.

645
00:50:32,433 --> 00:50:34,590
Since when do you call me like that?

646
00:50:34,808 --> 00:50:37,048
I'm only Bruno the retard.

647
00:50:37,725 --> 00:50:40,277
I found it.
It should be mine now.

648
00:50:42,225 --> 00:50:44,050
Look at that!
Where did you find it?

649
00:50:45,017 --> 00:50:47,505
On a bench
next to the town hall garden.

650
00:50:47,683 --> 00:50:48,714
Come on Bruno!
There are no benches

651
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:51,215
at the town hall anymore.

652
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:53,673
Must've been some place else then.
What's the difference anyway.

653
00:50:54,183 --> 00:50:57,880
Sounds strange to me.
Let's file a report.

654
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:02,931
Don't you think it's a good thing
he came in willingly.

655
00:51:03,517 --> 00:51:07,297
Willingly?
He's known to one and all!

656
00:51:07,933 --> 00:51:09,592
His file speaks miles about him:

657
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:13,263
cruelty towards animals,
wood theft and whatnot.

658
00:51:13,683 --> 00:51:16,883
Yeah but you can't prosecute me.
I'm protected by article 51!

659
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,217
I'm a mental case.
Fuck all of you!

660
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:43,380
Inspector Kersten?
Follow me, please.

661
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:49,054
On Central security service's orders.

662
00:52:04,767 --> 00:52:07,800
- I don't understand. What does it mean?
- I'm sorry, that's an order.

663
00:52:08,017 --> 00:52:11,513
What about tomorrow? It's the end
of our service and I've an appointment.

664
00:52:11,725 --> 00:52:13,134
I see.
Nevertheless!

665
00:52:13,308 --> 00:52:14,682
What's going on?

666
00:52:14,892 --> 00:52:17,131
I've absolutely no clue.
I just got an invitation

667
00:52:17,308 --> 00:52:19,714
from the Central security service.

668
00:52:19,892 --> 00:52:21,266
Miss Hornung, would you be so kind

669
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:23,258
to call captain Bohm?

670
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:25,592
Yes, of course.

671
00:52:33,392 --> 00:52:35,299
And tell him...

672
00:52:49,975 --> 00:52:51,930
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

673
00:52:53,225 --> 00:52:56,176
- Can I make a call?
- I'm afraid not.

674
00:52:58,017 --> 00:53:01,050
What if
it takes longer than expected?

675
00:53:01,225 --> 00:53:03,381
What makes you think that?

676
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:06,130
Your strange behavior,
to start with.

677
00:53:07,975 --> 00:53:10,973
You're free to complain
to the Gruppenfuhrer.

678
00:53:39,308 --> 00:53:41,761
Inspector Kersten, Gruppenfuhrer.

679
00:53:57,808 --> 00:54:01,304
Excuse-me for this somewhat
informal invitation...

680
00:54:01,517 --> 00:54:03,223
But between former soldiers...

681
00:54:03,433 --> 00:54:05,092
Please, take a seat.

682
00:54:10,808 --> 00:54:12,349
You may leave.

683
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:15,638
Sit down already.

684
00:54:22,642 --> 00:54:26,221
You're a hard-working man.
I received a detailed report on you.

685
00:54:27,183 --> 00:54:29,139
I'm just doing what I can, sir.

686
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:33,841
Come on,
no need for false modesty here.

687
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,845
You're on the verge
to crack a very sensitive case.

688
00:54:38,017 --> 00:54:39,214
You're always on the road,

689
00:54:39,392 --> 00:54:42,840
Hamburg, Kassel,
Lubeck, Schwerin, etc.

690
00:54:43,058 --> 00:54:44,966
That's very interesting.
Very interesting.

691
00:54:45,392 --> 00:54:46,801
Cigarette?

692
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,426
I don't smoke.

693
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:50,677
Congratulations.

694
00:54:50,961 --> 00:54:52,418
Now, excuse me!

695
00:55:04,058 --> 00:55:06,381
If I may inquire.
Who gave you that file?

696
00:55:07,308 --> 00:55:09,595
A liaison officer
from your department.

697
00:55:09,808 --> 00:55:11,716
Someone who's eagerly
following your progress.

698
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:15,092
Yes, sometimes, one has friends
where one least expects it.

699
00:55:15,267 --> 00:55:17,304
His name's... hold on...

700
00:55:18,767 --> 00:55:20,259
His name's Bruehl.

701
00:55:21,225 --> 00:55:22,718
Our assistant Bruehl?

702
00:55:26,996 --> 00:55:29,111
Your record's outstanding,
my dear friend

703
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:31,333
You're a decorated war veteran

704
00:55:31,683 --> 00:55:34,079
You're extremely successful
in your career and...

705
00:55:34,782 --> 00:55:35,616
Good grief!

706
00:55:37,173 --> 00:55:38,998
You're not a member of the party?

707
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,839
That's none of my business anyway.
You have your reasons, I understand that.

708
00:55:48,023 --> 00:55:51,867
Tell me everything
about that killer of yours.

709
00:55:54,283 --> 00:55:58,011
Since you've already read the file,
I won't elaborate.

710
00:55:58,398 --> 00:55:59,184
In my book,

711
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:03,638
all those murders have been committed
by the same killer.

712
00:56:03,742 --> 00:56:05,669
And he's still at large.

713
00:56:06,565 --> 00:56:10,929
Which implies to call for
numerous judgments revision.

714
00:56:11,815 --> 00:56:12,976
And so?

715
00:56:13,742 --> 00:56:15,981
These are miscarriages of justice!

716
00:56:16,294 --> 00:56:19,519
Those are not supposed to happen
in our german rule of law.

717
00:56:21,898 --> 00:56:23,177
Go on.

718
00:56:24,888 --> 00:56:28,304
The death was caused
by the fracture of the hyoid bone.

719
00:56:28,429 --> 00:56:29,939
Which is extremely rare.

720
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:33,104
The killer has
incredible strength.

721
00:56:33,585 --> 00:56:35,940
His motive for killing always seems
to be the same.

722
00:56:36,085 --> 00:56:39,471
One moment.
Fracture of the hyoid bone?

723
00:56:40,148 --> 00:56:42,226
What does it mean?
I'm not familiar with the human anatomy.

724
00:56:42,335 --> 00:56:44,783
Maybe you could show me?

725
00:56:46,565 --> 00:56:47,595
Yes.

726
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:53,877
That's how he kept his grip...

727
00:56:54,565 --> 00:56:56,354
He put his hands just like that.

728
00:56:57,023 --> 00:56:58,053
So?

729
00:56:58,606 --> 00:57:00,644
If you squeeze hard enough,
the hyoid bone breaks

730
00:57:00,856 --> 00:57:03,689
and the victim dies,
choking on his own tongue.

731
00:57:06,502 --> 00:57:08,111
That's weird.

732
00:57:09,273 --> 00:57:10,896
Anyway,
I still can't picture it.

733
00:57:11,106 --> 00:57:14,851
I can't demonstrate it.
I haven't enough strength, unfortunately.

734
00:57:15,106 --> 00:57:16,450
"Unfortunately"?

735
00:57:20,825 --> 00:57:22,011
Kersten!

736
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:23,814
"Unfortunately"!

737
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:27,181
Is this remark of yours directed at me
or at the SS in general?

738
00:57:27,356 --> 00:57:28,932
Gruppenfuhrer!

739
00:57:29,148 --> 00:57:32,146
The murderer
must be strong like a bull.

740
00:57:32,356 --> 00:57:35,888
A circus performer maybe. In any case,
a man with abnormal behavior.

741
00:57:36,106 --> 00:57:36,935
Stop it.

742
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,636
Sit down.

743
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:42,015
That's exactly
what I wanted to hear from you.

744
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:46,397
A man suffering severe psychic disorders,
afflicted with a genetic retardation

745
00:57:46,565 --> 00:57:48,804
and an alcoholic father. Who knows?

746
00:57:48,981 --> 00:57:50,723
A neighbor in the streetcar,

747
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:55,182
or a waiter maybe,
a circus performer.

748
00:57:55,398 --> 00:57:58,147
Bring me his personal file.

749
00:57:58,481 --> 00:58:00,306
He kills women in the dead of night.

750
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:05,096
One at first, then a dozen,
even more maybe...

751
00:58:06,106 --> 00:58:09,270
A bona fide citizen of
this quiet and peaceful city.

752
00:58:09,481 --> 00:58:13,261
No record,
no criminal history whatsoever.

753
00:58:14,231 --> 00:58:16,471
But as soon as you check
his family history,

754
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:19,806
you stumble upon an uncle
who ended up in an asylum

755
00:58:20,252 --> 00:58:24,054
or a grandfather who died
of alcohol poisoning.

756
00:58:25,096 --> 00:58:27,283
In any case,
we're looking for a village idiot,

757
00:58:27,627 --> 00:58:30,017
someone who's mentally
and physically impaired.

758
00:58:33,688 --> 00:58:35,643
Did you study
the racial theories?

759
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:41,078
- Superficially.
- Read them line by line.

760
00:58:41,526 --> 00:58:44,228
Our supreme duty is to
uphold the strength of our race.

761
00:58:44,523 --> 00:58:46,679
You wouldn't object to

762
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:50,721
the superiority of our race, would you?
No, of course not. Very wise.

763
00:58:51,538 --> 00:58:53,850
We need to develop our skills
to an elite level.

764
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:56,589
And that's only possible through
a stringent if somewhat cruel selection.

765
00:58:56,798 --> 00:58:58,540
We should abide by the laws of nature

766
00:58:58,756 --> 00:59:01,838
and dispose
of the weaker, impaired species.

767
00:59:09,906 --> 00:59:12,821
Where are you, my little devil?

768
00:59:13,031 --> 00:59:16,278
Another air-raid warning. We'd like
to resume the party in the basement.

769
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:19,322
Sweetie, don't you
see I have a guest here.

770
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:22,360
Bring him over, then.

771
00:59:22,573 --> 00:59:27,094
You should see my little devil's
wine cellar. It's quite an eyesight.

772
00:59:27,563 --> 00:59:30,822
I'm giving a little party.
Just what one needs from time to time.

773
00:59:31,281 --> 00:59:33,402
Where were I?

774
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:35,570
You got me all confused now.

775
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:40,729
Yes, that's right: the elimination
of the pathological elements.

776
00:59:40,948 --> 00:59:43,318
This is almost a textbook case.

777
00:59:43,948 --> 00:59:45,985
Bring me that abnormal murderer

778
00:59:46,156 --> 00:59:48,443
and I'll scare the good people witless.

779
00:59:48,656 --> 00:59:52,125
<i>I need to set the proper context
to pass a lex... what-you-call-it,</i>

780
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,942
a bill applying to certain persons.

781
00:59:55,156 --> 00:59:58,403
Do you need any assistants?
A power of attorney letter? Cars? Gas?

782
00:59:58,615 --> 01:00:04,021
Nobody's going to interfere. You'll
have access to all the files you need.

783
01:00:04,329 --> 01:00:07,090
I'm not sure
I'm really the fit you're looking for.

784
01:00:07,302 --> 01:00:10,610
It seems my wound
got the better of me,

785
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:13,478
but I can recommend you
several names.

786
01:00:13,698 --> 01:00:17,478
My god, you were stationed
in Podwoliszicka?

787
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:19,984
In that godforsaken hole.

788
01:00:20,198 --> 01:00:23,344
There's a slaughterhouse,
close to the station.

789
01:00:23,448 --> 01:00:25,320
How long did you stay there?

790
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:26,651
Two months.

791
01:00:27,823 --> 01:00:30,193
I stayed for two hours.

792
01:00:30,823 --> 01:00:32,563
You wouldn't go back, would you?

793
01:00:34,531 --> 01:00:37,529
Just the thought alone,
makes me want to itch.

794
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,856
We're going to clean up every inch,
from Beuthen to Moscow.

795
01:00:41,073 --> 01:00:44,604
Where were I? Right!
You'll be in charge. And that's that.

796
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:48,064
I knew I could be straight with you.

797
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:57,771
On the front, during the air raids,
we used to say: "Come in!"

798
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:01,313
- Nervous?
- No.

799
01:01:02,948 --> 01:01:04,524
A genuine Wouwerman.

800
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,565
Someone acquired this
in the Netherlands for me.

801
01:01:06,948 --> 01:01:09,650
They're making a fortune
on our backs.

802
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:18,610
Go ahead, I'll be right there.

803
01:01:29,906 --> 01:01:31,861
All right, all right!

804
01:01:38,865 --> 01:01:40,736
Come on, Kersten.

805
01:01:50,065 --> 01:01:52,055
Another beer, captain?

806
01:01:52,231 --> 01:01:54,554
I'd prefer a cognac.

807
01:01:54,731 --> 01:01:56,722
A good brand preferably.
I wouldn't say no to a glass of Hennessy

808
01:01:56,898 --> 01:01:59,221
A barrel or a crate, general?

809
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,265
Don't be silly,
a bottle will do.

810
01:02:01,481 --> 01:02:04,314
Or do you mean to keep
your special stash a secret?

811
01:02:04,523 --> 01:02:05,601
Precisely.

812
01:02:06,804 --> 01:02:09,773
I'll bring you a plain beer then.
Coming up.

813
01:02:13,523 --> 01:02:16,307
You're worrying way too much,
my sweet little cousin.

814
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:20,803
Tell me, is there anything going on
between you and the upholsterer?

815
01:02:21,398 --> 01:02:23,223
Don't be daft.
What do you mean anyway?

816
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,054
Courtly love's what I had I mind.
He's a swell guy, isn't he?

817
01:02:27,356 --> 01:02:30,438
Yes, it's true.
I do appreciate him a lot.

818
01:02:33,565 --> 01:02:35,141
Did you ever "appreciate"
someone like that?

819
01:02:36,315 --> 01:02:39,229
If you really want to know: no.

820
01:02:41,815 --> 01:02:45,097
All right, I'll put him
on my long list of "proteges".

821
01:02:45,315 --> 01:02:48,017
While I still can.

822
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:51,731
Your cousin will soon
leave this district.

823
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:53,848
Have you been transferred?

824
01:02:54,065 --> 01:02:56,731
- To the front?
- That's all I can say.

825
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,681
Secret order.

826
01:02:58,898 --> 01:03:02,015
Nobody knows about it, except for me
and my radio-operator.

827
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,189
Tell me, have you ever been to Sweden?

828
01:03:07,148 --> 01:03:09,304
No, what would I do in Sweden?

829
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:13,102
We have some relatives there.
The Suderstrom, for instance.

830
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:17,104
Anyway, you know how to reach me.

831
01:03:18,065 --> 01:03:21,477
If your upholsterer
doesn't manage to stay out of trouble,

832
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:23,515
call me.

833
01:03:26,273 --> 01:03:27,766
I think we can arrange something.

834
01:03:27,981 --> 01:03:31,752
I talked to the boss. He's open-handed
and likes soldiers a lot.

835
01:03:41,565 --> 01:03:44,053
<i>Hello and Heil Hitler!
Any news about my purse.</i>

836
01:03:44,731 --> 01:03:45,679
Why are you asking?

837
01:03:46,773 --> 01:03:50,221
Anna said the purse would be mine
if nobody asked for it.

838
01:03:50,981 --> 01:03:52,225
And, well, I found it.

839
01:03:53,106 --> 01:03:55,559
In two years, brother.
These things take time.

840
01:03:56,148 --> 01:03:57,890
That long?

841
01:03:59,565 --> 01:04:00,939
Where's my purse now?

842
01:04:01,745 --> 01:04:04,297
Beats me. It was passed on.

843
01:04:04,513 --> 01:04:06,760
Another department claimed it.
Bad luck!

844
01:04:06,981 --> 01:04:09,683
Maybe the owner
has finally showed up.

845
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,101
What do you mean?

846
01:04:18,315 --> 01:04:19,891
Gruppenfuhrer Scharf.
At your service.

847
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,855
Thank you.
What are these goods for?

848
01:04:23,065 --> 01:04:25,351
- That's your ration.
- What ration?

849
01:04:25,565 --> 01:04:27,970
You'll be supplied with these
every 10 days.

850
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:30,725
- Canned foods will arrive shortly.
- Canned foods?

851
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,729
Put it all in the safe,

852
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,681
this is a state secret after all.

853
01:04:47,481 --> 01:04:49,306
French cognac.

854
01:04:49,523 --> 01:04:51,976
Russian tea... grown in China.

855
01:04:52,898 --> 01:04:54,688
Soap, that's nice.

856
01:04:55,648 --> 01:04:57,271
Cigarettes. So what?

857
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,470
Heavens!

858
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:01,392
Help yourself, Bruehl.
Do you drink, do you smoke?

859
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:04,095
I sure wouldn't mind
a nice cup of coffee.

860
01:05:04,773 --> 01:05:07,854
I'm afraid it won't happen so soon.
The canned foods are on their way.

861
01:05:08,231 --> 01:05:10,388
I'll just set myself some soap aside.

862
01:05:11,065 --> 01:05:14,265
In these nasty times,
it's better to keep one's hands clean.

863
01:05:14,815 --> 01:05:16,852
So far so good.

864
01:05:17,065 --> 01:05:20,016
Miss Hornung, what happened to
the found object, the purse?

865
01:05:20,231 --> 01:05:22,720
It was delivered this morning.

866
01:05:22,898 --> 01:05:24,095
There you go.

867
01:05:25,023 --> 01:05:26,101
Thanks.

868
01:05:26,648 --> 01:05:28,189
Here's the file:

869
01:05:28,356 --> 01:05:30,927
"Delivered
at precinct 185

870
01:05:31,148 --> 01:05:35,094
"by Bruno Ludke,
living at Jaegerstrasse 14,

871
01:05:35,315 --> 01:05:39,308
"in tow with Anna Hohmann,
living at the same address... "

872
01:06:04,406 --> 01:06:06,480
Hi, Bruno. How are you doing?

873
01:06:08,448 --> 01:06:09,822
What do you want?

874
01:06:10,406 --> 01:06:12,278
I'm looking for a strong man.

875
01:06:12,865 --> 01:06:15,732
I don't work for money
anymore.

876
01:06:16,448 --> 01:06:18,439
What's the point?
Money's become useless.

877
01:06:18,948 --> 01:06:21,732
I need to eat. I want
cigarettes and Schnaps.

878
01:06:22,323 --> 01:06:24,314
I'm sure we'll agree on something.

879
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:30,442
- What's that?
- That's Aquavit. Comes from Denmark.

880
01:06:30,656 --> 01:06:32,979
What are you waiting for?
Pop the cork.

881
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,486
So be it.
And let's talk business.

882
01:06:36,698 --> 01:06:39,021
- You wouldn't have a corkscrew, would you?
- Yes.

883
01:06:41,906 --> 01:06:43,648
Can't find it.

884
01:06:43,906 --> 01:06:46,146
Forget about it.
Let me try it my way.

885
01:06:51,323 --> 01:06:54,356
Jesus!
What's wrong with that bottle?

886
01:06:54,573 --> 01:06:56,480
A firm hold, that's all you need.

887
01:06:59,073 --> 01:07:00,731
Too bad, I spilled some.

888
01:07:06,365 --> 01:07:08,190
- What's your name?
- Axel.

889
01:07:08,406 --> 01:07:10,029
You're a nice fellow.
Have a drink.

890
01:07:10,906 --> 01:07:14,189
That's quite an act you showed me there,
popping the cork without a sweat.

891
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,780
It seems like you impressed a few people
in Hamburg as well.

892
01:07:20,031 --> 01:07:22,271
Lucy Hansen, for instance.

893
01:07:25,531 --> 01:07:26,941
Whaddaya mean?

894
01:07:27,323 --> 01:07:32,000
You know who I mean.
The pudgy waitress you wasted.

895
01:07:32,784 --> 01:07:34,031
She must have been...

896
01:07:45,531 --> 01:07:48,648
Man! How did you do it?

897
01:07:49,281 --> 01:07:51,402
Nobody ever managed
to knock me down.

898
01:07:53,406 --> 01:07:57,958
Strength alone is worth nothing.
I know a few tricks myself.

899
01:07:58,073 --> 01:08:01,194
I gotta learn those tricks.
Who showed them to you?

900
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:05,070
I learned those on the police force.

901
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:09,730
So you're a copper.

902
01:08:10,781 --> 01:08:13,186
What about
that job offer of yours?

903
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,154
And don't say
I wasted somebody ever again.

904
01:08:17,365 --> 01:08:19,355
I don't like the sound of it.

905
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,697
Are these your men?

906
01:08:36,531 --> 01:08:38,356
Screw you!

907
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:42,104
I'm protected by article 51!
I'm crazy!

908
01:08:45,948 --> 01:08:48,022
Come, Bruno. Here you go.

909
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,529
All righty, Axel. Let's go.

910
01:09:09,581 --> 01:09:13,492
According your own confession,
you committed several murders.

911
01:09:13,831 --> 01:09:15,407
How many?

912
01:09:15,748 --> 01:09:19,409
I didn't keep the score.
Around fifty, one hundred or so.

913
01:09:20,748 --> 01:09:23,911
So you know how to count?
Well, do the math then!

914
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:30,077
One, two, three, four...

915
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:34,781
Axel, he's making a fool out of me.
I'm not going to count for everyone.

916
01:09:36,331 --> 01:09:37,990
Bruno, stop the act.

917
01:09:38,498 --> 01:09:41,033
You promised you'd behave yourself.

918
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:43,736
I'm starving.

919
01:09:45,081 --> 01:09:46,953
Name all 5 continents!

920
01:09:47,915 --> 01:09:50,485
East, west, south, north.

921
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:53,490
How big's your little finger?

922
01:09:54,498 --> 01:09:55,695
About three feet.

923
01:10:09,415 --> 01:10:10,528
Don't let yourself get distracted.

924
01:10:23,415 --> 01:10:26,033
Do you go to church sometimes?

925
01:10:26,581 --> 01:10:29,781
I used to go before.
Not anymore.

926
01:10:29,998 --> 01:10:32,782
- Why is that?
- 'Cause I'm in jail.

927
01:10:34,665 --> 01:10:36,620
Are you still praying in your cell?

928
01:10:41,456 --> 01:10:44,988
"Help me God each day,
To follow You along the way. "

929
01:10:45,165 --> 01:10:48,079
I want to be good.
I won't do it again.

930
01:10:50,206 --> 01:10:51,485
Tell me.

931
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:54,659
Don't you think
he's getting a rise out of us?

932
01:10:54,873 --> 01:10:57,361
He's fooling us.
He's stringing us along.

933
01:10:57,581 --> 01:11:00,994
But his confessions match with
the facts of the case.

934
01:11:01,206 --> 01:11:03,161
We could link him to all 55 killings.

935
01:11:03,373 --> 01:11:05,198
Well, listen carefully!

936
01:11:05,706 --> 01:11:07,780
Who was Bismarck?

937
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:10,074
It was Hindenburg!

938
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,654
That does it! This isn't the proper way
to lead an investigation.

939
01:11:17,165 --> 01:11:21,158
He's making everything up!
You should catch him in his own trap.

940
01:11:21,873 --> 01:11:25,155
He's quite stubborn in public.
I'll talk to him alone, later.

941
01:11:25,373 --> 01:11:27,944
When we'll make a plaster cast
of his head at the museum.

942
01:11:28,164 --> 01:11:29,705
The perfect occasion to grill him again.

943
01:11:29,915 --> 01:11:31,785
He's all yours.

944
01:11:31,998 --> 01:11:35,280
Unless this case is rock solid,
it won't be of no use to me.

945
01:11:35,497 --> 01:11:38,448
There's so much at stake here,
my head's almost on a plate.

946
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:43,828
That goes for you as well, by the way.

947
01:11:59,365 --> 01:12:01,817
Your memory's excellent, Bruno.

948
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:03,357
I'm counting on you.

949
01:12:05,656 --> 01:12:07,860
Tomorrow we'll drive you to a place
you're familiar with.

950
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:11,941
You'll guide us and you'll tell us
exactly where and how it all happened.

951
01:12:12,718 --> 01:12:14,521
You won't leave out any details.

952
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:17,738
You know,
my boss is very thorough.

953
01:12:17,906 --> 01:12:19,564
He wants to know every detail.

954
01:12:21,947 --> 01:12:24,614
Axel, you're still there?

955
01:12:25,822 --> 01:12:30,292
I think this guy wants to snuff me out!
It's so dark in here!

956
01:12:38,478 --> 01:12:39,667
I'm all ears, Bruno.

957
01:12:39,801 --> 01:12:42,730
Over there, to the left.
There's a hill.

958
01:12:43,948 --> 01:12:47,893
Nothing beats the whiff of fresh air
in the early morning, Axel.

959
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:51,594
Come on, Gee up!
Let's get this horse moving!

960
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:13,527
Are you out of your mind?
What's wrong with you?

961
01:13:13,739 --> 01:13:16,104
Come on!
That was just for kicks.

962
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,644
We need to lighten up.
We're working too much.

963
01:13:18,823 --> 01:13:21,646
Boy, did she get sacred!

964
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:23,609
Let go of him.

965
01:13:27,115 --> 01:13:29,603
It reeks of mushrooms here.

966
01:13:29,823 --> 01:13:31,109
Jail sucks.

967
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:35,193
There's a lake nearby. Let's take a dive.
The others can wait here.

968
01:13:35,594 --> 01:13:39,510
Work comes first.
Where did it happen?

969
01:13:39,947 --> 01:13:42,151
Not here. Come.

970
01:13:48,948 --> 01:13:49,977
So?

971
01:13:50,948 --> 01:13:54,395
- And my smoke?
- Do your part first. Tell me.

972
01:13:55,073 --> 01:13:56,234
I'm fed up wit it!

973
01:13:56,447 --> 01:13:59,585
Don't make things harder than
they already are. Let's hear it.

974
01:13:59,771 --> 01:14:02,446
All right, just to make you happy then!

975
01:14:04,531 --> 01:14:07,398
I walked a lot that day,
my legs were aching.

976
01:14:07,615 --> 01:14:10,364
That's the place where I took a rest.

977
01:14:11,865 --> 01:14:15,727
I still had a potato in my
pocket, I ate it up.

978
01:14:17,582 --> 01:14:18,660
She arrived.

979
01:14:20,969 --> 01:14:22,375
She was pretty.

980
01:14:23,365 --> 01:14:26,190
She wore a blue what-you-call-it.
A blouse.

981
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:30,411
She had a bunch of flowers.

982
01:14:30,552 --> 01:14:31,841
And she was singing.

983
01:14:32,864 --> 01:14:34,523
Those were buttercups.

984
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:38,458
I said to myself:
let her sing just a little bit more.

985
01:14:39,155 --> 01:14:40,865
I stood up

986
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,986
and I followed her.

987
01:14:48,655 --> 01:14:50,611
She didn't notice me.

988
01:14:50,947 --> 01:14:53,401
Suddenly,
she dropped something.

989
01:14:54,172 --> 01:14:55,348
She bent over

990
01:14:55,864 --> 01:14:57,486
and picked it up.

991
01:14:58,791 --> 01:15:00,707
I hid myself
behind a tree.

992
01:15:04,405 --> 01:15:08,832
She must have seen me by then
'cause she got all scared.

993
01:15:09,045 --> 01:15:10,506
She ran off.

994
01:15:12,614 --> 01:15:15,316
I ran after her.
I was faster.

995
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:39,311
"Stay!
I won't hurt you. "

996
01:15:43,791 --> 01:15:46,802
Just wait till I get you,
little pest.

997
01:16:12,448 --> 01:16:14,823
That's when I did her.

998
01:16:15,155 --> 01:16:17,644
She didn't budge.

999
01:17:30,489 --> 01:17:32,966
I had to bury her.
What if someone came by?

1000
01:17:33,135 --> 01:17:36,444
And so I dug
and looked all around.

1001
01:17:36,905 --> 01:17:38,979
I was on all fours
and while I was digging,

1002
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,773
I took a look.
Up. And down again.

1003
01:17:43,823 --> 01:17:45,232
There was nobody around.

1004
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,520
Is that her?

1005
01:17:50,469 --> 01:17:52,063
That's right.

1006
01:17:52,843 --> 01:17:54,218
What about my cigarette?

1007
01:17:54,574 --> 01:17:58,402
You really have an excellent memory.
You deserve your cigarette.

1008
01:18:00,031 --> 01:18:01,571
Hold on a sec!

1009
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:24,395
I concealed it.

1010
01:18:24,744 --> 01:18:27,802
What do you say about that!
You didn't find it!

1011
01:18:31,365 --> 01:18:32,857
Are you convinced now?

1012
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:34,285
And how!

1013
01:18:34,401 --> 01:18:37,927
It seems you hit the jackpot!

1014
01:18:38,516 --> 01:18:39,521
- Care for a gulp?
- Thank you.

1015
01:18:43,371 --> 01:18:44,616
My name's Wolf-Dieter.

1016
01:18:44,785 --> 01:18:45,800
I'm Axel.

1017
01:18:46,034 --> 01:18:48,702
Listen Axel,
there's a rumor going around.

1018
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:51,186
I have a good sense of hearing.

1019
01:18:51,551 --> 01:18:54,467
Seems like our case
will land on the highest desks.

1020
01:18:54,694 --> 01:18:57,129
- You mean the SS-Reichsfuhrer?
- Higher.

1021
01:18:57,527 --> 01:18:58,620
The Fuhr...

1022
01:19:10,223 --> 01:19:11,768
That's fine.

1023
01:19:12,556 --> 01:19:13,796
Let's go.

1024
01:19:34,431 --> 01:19:36,753
Are we stuck?

1025
01:19:37,118 --> 01:19:39,156
It looks a lot like sabotage.

1026
01:19:40,563 --> 01:19:43,678
Gruppenfuhrer, may I inquire
if your hearing with the Fuhrer

1027
01:19:43,929 --> 01:19:45,833
went well?

1028
01:19:46,035 --> 01:19:48,846
Your curiosity is totally understandable
and yet unseemly.

1029
01:19:49,056 --> 01:19:51,260
Anyway, this is what I can tell you:

1030
01:19:51,513 --> 01:19:55,007
bureau M1/7 is dismantled
with immediate effect.

1031
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:58,874
There were certain factors
that bothered the powers to be.

1032
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:01,148
I'm expecting Kersten tonight
for a full report.

1033
01:20:01,265 --> 01:20:04,733
The Fuhrer expects us to proceed
with the execution tomorrow.

1034
01:20:04,994 --> 01:20:08,748
I'll make the necessary arrangements
as soon as we arrive in Berlin.

1035
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:11,035
Arrangements?
That's an order.

1036
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:14,942
You ought to read
between the lines by now.

1037
01:20:15,879 --> 01:20:17,338
Our Fuhrer
is the greatest mind of our time.

1038
01:20:17,473 --> 01:20:21,679
It's such an honor to work under
his orders for the sake of our country.

1039
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:24,711
The idea that the Lubke case
could support

1040
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:27,680
a bill to eliminate degenerate beings,

1041
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:32,677
was quite appealing at first,
but to what results?

1042
01:20:33,213 --> 01:20:35,358
Not to mention the people's reaction?

1043
01:20:35,775 --> 01:20:38,796
A feeling of insecurity maybe.

1044
01:20:39,109 --> 01:20:40,964
I mean he killed 80 people.

1045
01:20:41,051 --> 01:20:42,773
Fear? You're talking about fear?

1046
01:20:42,895 --> 01:20:46,308
A true german doesn't live in fear.
It's much more dangerous than that.

1047
01:20:46,570 --> 01:20:49,890
That monster has been on the loose
ever since we seized power.

1048
01:20:50,098 --> 01:20:54,966
Imagine the mess if people
lost their confidence in the police.

1049
01:20:55,363 --> 01:20:58,397
If only he were a
jew or a foreigner...

1050
01:20:59,347 --> 01:21:01,718
Why are we still stuck?
Chase those sheep away!

1051
01:21:01,931 --> 01:21:03,802
Pull away!

1052
01:21:12,476 --> 01:21:14,514
- Cheers!
- Thank you.

1053
01:21:15,723 --> 01:21:20,098
Three weeks from now,
and everything will be over.

1054
01:21:21,015 --> 01:21:22,970
There'll always be a case to deal with.

1055
01:21:24,015 --> 01:21:26,300
Huh! Huh! Not for me. My purpose is...

1056
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:29,714
to keep a low profile.

1057
01:21:30,181 --> 01:21:32,670
Everything has been settled!

1058
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:35,577
From today on,
we'll have a private life.

1059
01:21:36,265 --> 01:21:39,263
I imagined my private life
a bit differently.

1060
01:21:39,473 --> 01:21:41,297
A wedding with Wollenberg?

1061
01:21:41,848 --> 01:21:45,627
Thomas is my cousin.
You still don't get it, do you?

1062
01:21:46,681 --> 01:21:50,756
Besides, I'm worried about him. I think
he's about to make a big mistake.

1063
01:21:50,931 --> 01:21:52,589
What do you mean?

1064
01:21:52,806 --> 01:21:54,513
He talked about going on a trip.

1065
01:21:54,722 --> 01:21:56,595
Are you saying he wants to run away?

1066
01:21:57,140 --> 01:22:00,054
- Is it worth it?
- Now, look who's talking.

1067
01:22:00,424 --> 01:22:02,963
You're the Gestapo's darling.

1068
01:22:03,171 --> 01:22:03,952
Come on!

1069
01:22:04,765 --> 01:22:07,514
<i>All men above the age of 18
as well as all women</i>

1070
01:22:08,473 --> 01:22:14,577
<i>between age 25 and 55
are concerned. </i>

1071
01:22:15,273 --> 01:22:17,503
How many years before you turn 55?

1072
01:22:18,015 --> 01:22:21,345
<i>Hamburg's criminal court
has pronounced today</i>

1073
01:22:21,514 --> 01:22:24,381
<i>his final verdict
in the Willi Keun case, 44 years old. </i>

1074
01:22:24,597 --> 01:22:28,460
<i>Based upon clear evidence,
the accused has been sentenced to death. </i>

1075
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:33,502
The bastards! They promised to
adjourn the proceedings.

1076
01:22:33,681 --> 01:22:35,174
Helga, we have to act!

1077
01:22:35,347 --> 01:22:37,384
Call Mollwitz in Berlin.

1078
01:22:37,598 --> 01:22:39,672
At this hour,
he must be boozing in some bar.

1079
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:41,132
And there's plenty of them!

1080
01:22:41,347 --> 01:22:43,718
- And Rossdorf?
- This is saturday!

1081
01:22:43,931 --> 01:22:45,507
All offices are closed.

1082
01:22:45,722 --> 01:22:47,879
Those gentlemen like to play peace.

1083
01:22:48,098 --> 01:22:51,298
Let's leave right away.
He could be hanged tomorrow.

1084
01:23:42,406 --> 01:23:44,693
Excuse the rubble.
Courtesy of the everlasting bombings.

1085
01:23:44,865 --> 01:23:47,614
Please, sit down.

1086
01:23:55,914 --> 01:23:58,236
That's quite an unusual hour, Kersten.

1087
01:23:58,479 --> 01:24:00,853
And so is the situation,
your honor.

1088
01:24:01,073 --> 01:24:03,277
Yes, you've alluded to that.

1089
01:24:03,808 --> 01:24:06,344
However the verdict
has already been pronounced.

1090
01:24:06,698 --> 01:24:11,135
Your honor, Keun is innocent.
I have the murder's written confession.

1091
01:24:12,913 --> 01:24:14,192
That's interesting!

1092
01:24:14,781 --> 01:24:17,945
Proof again that evidence
can be misleading.

1093
01:24:18,204 --> 01:24:19,861
Can I take a look at the file?

1094
01:24:22,209 --> 01:24:23,239
Well.

1095
01:24:24,198 --> 01:24:25,821
There's a small problem though.

1096
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:29,817
I'm not really authorized
to let you go through the file.

1097
01:24:29,989 --> 01:24:32,646
We need to obtain a reprieve
from the court in Hamburg.

1098
01:24:33,742 --> 01:24:37,107
You're speaking to the wrong man.
I barely presided over the court.

1099
01:24:37,384 --> 01:24:38,624
I know.

1100
01:24:39,169 --> 01:24:42,432
The DA's office has been bombed.
We don't have his personal address.

1101
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:43,792
The court must have it.

1102
01:24:44,198 --> 01:24:45,988
It's closed now.
And tomorrow's sunday.

1103
01:24:46,324 --> 01:24:49,729
I'm afraid we won't be able
to avoid the irreparable.

1104
01:24:49,938 --> 01:24:51,409
- You understand...
- I...

1105
01:24:53,739 --> 01:24:57,104
You seem to be so positive
about this Keun case.

1106
01:24:57,355 --> 01:24:58,303
Absolutely.

1107
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:01,474
We have way more evidence
than a mere confession.

1108
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:05,875
Still! You need the proper documents.
The DA is extremely meticulous.

1109
01:25:09,614 --> 01:25:11,651
Can I make a phone call to Berlin?

1110
01:25:11,865 --> 01:25:13,404
Of course.

1111
01:25:13,917 --> 01:25:16,749
I'd like to have an urgent talk
with Gruppenfuhrer Rossdorf.

1112
01:25:16,934 --> 01:25:18,097
What's the phone number?

1113
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:20,881
007003.

1114
01:25:37,329 --> 01:25:38,739
Rossdorf.

1115
01:25:41,147 --> 01:25:42,556
What are you doing in Hamburg?

1116
01:25:42,905 --> 01:25:44,648
Indulging in some beer and skittles, eh?

1117
01:25:44,864 --> 01:25:47,696
I've been expecting you, Kersten.

1118
01:25:47,905 --> 01:25:49,695
Who? Keun?

1119
01:25:49,905 --> 01:25:52,940
Haven't heard about him.
None of my concern either.

1120
01:25:53,906 --> 01:25:55,897
Listen to me Kersten.
You should mind your own business.

1121
01:25:56,115 --> 01:25:59,729
I would appreciate
if you'd cease your investigation.

1122
01:25:59,948 --> 01:26:03,230
You do remember that this matter
is still a state secret.

1123
01:26:03,447 --> 01:26:05,403
Come immediately to Berlin.

1124
01:26:05,614 --> 01:26:09,359
<i>I'll wait for you right here tomorrow.
Heil Hitler mister Kersten! Over and out.</i>

1125
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:15,510
All right, I'll hand the file
to Dr Schleffien.

1126
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:17,271
<i>Heil Hitler! Over and out.</i>

1127
01:26:22,534 --> 01:26:24,941
I wonder if Rossdorf

1128
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,958
really heard your last words?

1129
01:26:29,478 --> 01:26:31,267
Your honor,

1130
01:26:31,624 --> 01:26:34,373
we're talking about a man's life here
and about the law in general.

1131
01:26:35,281 --> 01:26:36,394
The Law?

1132
01:26:37,615 --> 01:26:40,945
"The law benefits to the german people.
The absence of the law harms him. "

1133
01:26:41,155 --> 01:26:43,526
I'm merely quoting
a renowned speech.

1134
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:47,296
Kersten, you should rely
on your lucky star now.

1135
01:26:47,575 --> 01:26:51,616
Our dearly beloved rule of law
has been scraped a long time ago.

1136
01:27:03,798 --> 01:27:07,750
Let me remove that cover.
It's all worn out anyway.

1137
01:27:10,210 --> 01:27:11,408
Rossdorf!

1138
01:27:25,531 --> 01:27:28,315
I don't like being
disturbed at night.

1139
01:27:33,663 --> 01:27:36,695
Dear Kersten,
thank you for this surprise visit.

1140
01:27:37,239 --> 01:27:40,403
Keep me fully informed and...

1141
01:27:40,825 --> 01:27:41,940
Be careful,

1142
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:44,192
as far as that goes.

1143
01:27:45,522 --> 01:27:46,719
Good night.

1144
01:27:48,331 --> 01:27:49,527
Thanks.

1145
01:28:24,872 --> 01:28:26,151
Come on, Keun.

1146
01:28:30,489 --> 01:28:32,278
Time to grab your stuff.

1147
01:28:32,489 --> 01:28:35,403
- No, I'm innocent.
- You have some awesome connections.

1148
01:28:35,614 --> 01:28:38,979
No one has ever left
this cell alive before.

1149
01:28:40,698 --> 01:28:42,355
Come on.

1150
01:29:44,031 --> 01:29:47,148
They didn't have the decency to leave
a piece of soap, those bastards!

1151
01:29:53,156 --> 01:29:57,481
"And keep me
fully informed. "

1152
01:30:00,354 --> 01:30:01,760
Helga...

1153
01:30:05,447 --> 01:30:07,190
Get a hold of yourself.

1154
01:30:07,863 --> 01:30:11,986
"Be careful,
as far as that goes. "

1155
01:30:14,655 --> 01:30:16,693
I knew it!

1156
01:30:18,561 --> 01:30:19,990
Axel!

1157
01:30:43,115 --> 01:30:45,105
The car is waiting for you.

1158
01:30:45,989 --> 01:30:47,611
I'm coming.

1159
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:54,063
I'll call you later.

1160
01:31:49,715 --> 01:31:52,120
Here's inspector Kersten.

1161
01:31:56,339 --> 01:31:57,880
Thank you. You're dismissed.

1162
01:32:03,646 --> 01:32:04,677
So?

1163
01:32:05,423 --> 01:32:07,792
Go on,
tell me everything commissioner.

1164
01:32:08,506 --> 01:32:10,661
I'm all ears.

1165
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:15,338
Given the hard work I've done so far,
I think you owe me

1166
01:32:15,524 --> 01:32:18,283
an explanation
for this rather unusual method.

1167
01:32:18,496 --> 01:32:20,069
You think so?

1168
01:32:22,048 --> 01:32:24,715
How dare you hold the
Central security service

1169
01:32:24,881 --> 01:32:27,630
accountable for it's decisions?

1170
01:32:27,953 --> 01:32:31,864
- That's not what I meant.
- Be more accurate then!

1171
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:35,749
- I went to Hamburg.
- I'm aware of that.

1172
01:32:36,198 --> 01:32:38,734
Besides,
you called me.

1173
01:32:40,385 --> 01:32:42,709
Keun had been sentenced to death.

1174
01:32:43,339 --> 01:32:46,953
So I was told.
In the meantime you did a

1175
01:32:47,172 --> 01:32:48,547
very foolish thing.

1176
01:32:50,131 --> 01:32:52,086
How dare you lecture me?

1177
01:32:52,298 --> 01:32:54,704
Anyhow, go on...

1178
01:32:56,465 --> 01:32:57,957
Keun is innocent.

1179
01:32:58,384 --> 01:33:01,547
We have the proof
that Ludke killed the waitress.

1180
01:33:03,548 --> 01:33:05,004
Mr Kersten, you need to erase

1181
01:33:05,172 --> 01:33:09,470
Bruno Ludke from your memory
once and for all.

1182
01:33:09,588 --> 01:33:11,294
As you still don't seem to understand,

1183
01:33:11,422 --> 01:33:14,291
let me break it down for you:
the hunt is over,

1184
01:33:14,464 --> 01:33:16,538
we have to bury the file.
Fuhrer's order.

1185
01:33:17,256 --> 01:33:19,808
Do you get the full picture at last?

1186
01:33:20,647 --> 01:33:23,954
No, I guess my
intellectual capacities are limited.

1187
01:33:25,379 --> 01:33:28,626
I should have known
you wouldn't be cooperative. All right.

1188
01:33:29,163 --> 01:33:32,279
Let me explain what's at stake here,
in plain and simple words.

1189
01:33:32,923 --> 01:33:35,590
It would be highly prejudicial to us

1190
01:33:35,798 --> 01:33:38,915
to acknowledge the existence
of a serial killer.

1191
01:33:39,307 --> 01:33:40,642
That Keun!

1192
01:33:40,985 --> 01:33:44,247
He's merely a grain of sand
in the wheels of our machine!

1193
01:33:44,464 --> 01:33:48,933
A grain of sand? One that can easily
be discarded I guess.

1194
01:33:49,235 --> 01:33:52,122
Watch it, Kersten.
I don't like your tone.

1195
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:57,543
And I certainly don't approve of
your personal initiative in this matter!

1196
01:33:57,747 --> 01:34:01,361
Which forced us
to take decisive measures.

1197
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,078
I guess I owe you this summons then.

1198
01:34:04,297 --> 01:34:08,126
We work fast and efficiently, don't we?
And yes, that's my doing.

1199
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:12,954
Incidentally, "owe" is the right term.
You owe this loyal measure to my patience.

1200
01:34:13,886 --> 01:34:18,038
And to your efforts in a matter
I barely remember anything about.

1201
01:34:18,963 --> 01:34:20,648
You stood up against us!

1202
01:34:20,850 --> 01:34:24,808
Your irresponsible attitude forced me
to take matters into my own hands!

1203
01:34:25,047 --> 01:34:27,431
Executing Keun
amounts to a judicial murder.

1204
01:34:28,339 --> 01:34:31,373
- Keun is insignificant!
- He's a member of the party.

1205
01:34:31,547 --> 01:34:34,665
So what!
The party's full of black sheep.

1206
01:34:34,839 --> 01:34:37,541
You were close to
join the party yourself.

1207
01:34:38,097 --> 01:34:42,044
And you're everything but a nazi,
aren't you?

1208
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,988
For once, I'll agree with you.

1209
01:34:45,214 --> 01:34:49,339
You may put a brave face now
but we both know you're desperate,

1210
01:34:49,548 --> 01:34:51,527
and I'm not impressed.

1211
01:34:51,996 --> 01:34:55,659
I've seen so much people turning
their backs against God and the Fuhrer.

1212
01:34:55,881 --> 01:34:57,752
I'm used to it.

1213
01:34:58,911 --> 01:35:02,204
Get off your high horse, inspector!

1214
01:35:02,569 --> 01:35:05,422
You're the only one to blame
for Keun's death.

1215
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:06,833
This is going
to be very difficult to prove.

1216
01:35:07,089 --> 01:35:08,547
Difficult?

1217
01:35:08,715 --> 01:35:12,459
He could have been sent home tomorrow
if only you had kept quiet.

1218
01:35:12,673 --> 01:35:15,623
You were the one who started
yacking about Ludke.

1219
01:35:16,006 --> 01:35:17,623
Shut up already!

1220
01:35:18,090 --> 01:35:19,997
Divulging state secrets!

1221
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:24,060
If your so hell-bent on wasting
your life, do it on your own!

1222
01:35:24,496 --> 01:35:27,569
Are you fitting me up
for a judicial murder?

1223
01:35:27,949 --> 01:35:30,079
You brought this upon yourself.

1224
01:35:30,389 --> 01:35:34,086
Examine your own conscience.
You're nothing but a big mouth!

1225
01:35:35,255 --> 01:35:38,372
That's the foulest trick
I've ever lived to see.

1226
01:35:38,548 --> 01:35:42,706
I only did my duty, that's all.
You're not even flinching

1227
01:35:42,881 --> 01:35:44,457
at the thought of a man's death.

1228
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:46,503
True enough.

1229
01:35:47,343 --> 01:35:48,835
Nor am I worried about yours,
for that matter.

1230
01:35:49,069 --> 01:35:50,456
I realize that.
I believe...

1231
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:52,589
"I believe"!

1232
01:35:52,819 --> 01:35:55,288
That word's got whiskers on it!

1233
01:35:58,086 --> 01:36:00,657
Do you believe in God?

1234
01:36:03,798 --> 01:36:04,793
Yes.

1235
01:36:06,548 --> 01:36:10,542
Don't trust him too much.
You can't count on his help these days.

1236
01:36:11,505 --> 01:36:13,793
One day, the law
will be the law again.

1237
01:36:14,006 --> 01:36:15,499
We'll probably be dead by then but...

1238
01:36:15,714 --> 01:36:19,044
You will, that's for sure. Which brings
me right to the matter at hand.

1239
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:21,958
You will not be prosecuted
before a secret military court

1240
01:36:22,173 --> 01:36:25,289
as I first had in mind.
However, I have to forgo my plans

1241
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:28,975
as our country's military situation
is at stake here.

1242
01:36:30,214 --> 01:36:32,668
You see, that's the Curonian peninsula.

1243
01:36:33,255 --> 01:36:35,542
A heavily crowded place.

1244
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:40,588
I arranged for a sector
where you can prove your mettle.

1245
01:36:42,039 --> 01:36:44,965
That's what I call "front" probation.

1246
01:36:45,844 --> 01:36:49,092
You won't serve
as a commanding officer though.

1247
01:36:50,111 --> 01:36:53,311
I'm afraid you'll have to learn
to be obedient again. Heinrich!

1248
01:36:57,464 --> 01:37:01,044
Mr Kersten will remain in custody
before his departure for the front.

1249
01:37:01,256 --> 01:37:02,333
At your command.

1250
01:37:02,547 --> 01:37:05,379
Mr Kersten, you'd do yourself a favor

1251
01:37:05,589 --> 01:37:09,666
if you erased Bruno Ludke's name
from your memory.

1252
01:37:10,797 --> 01:37:15,017
The man never existed!

1253
01:37:21,631 --> 01:37:26,123
Bring me Helga Hornung's
personal file now.

1254
01:37:26,298 --> 01:37:29,876
Criminal Investigation Department,
bureau M1/7.

1255
01:38:20,589 --> 01:38:23,125
Kersten, are you expecting someone?

1256
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:25,164
I'm not quite sure.

1257
01:38:25,381 --> 01:38:26,754
Sergeant major!

1258
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,623
- Lieutenant?
- Time to get on and go.

1259
01:38:30,839 --> 01:38:32,297
At your command.

1260
01:38:32,756 --> 01:38:34,297
First train!

1261
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:29,040
You got my message!

1262
01:39:29,214 --> 01:39:33,043
I was expecting the worst.
Rossdorf asked for your file.

1263
01:39:33,215 --> 01:39:36,248
Don't worry.
What's that uniform you're wearing!

1264
01:39:37,131 --> 01:39:40,081
It could have been worse.
"Front probation".

1265
01:39:40,298 --> 01:39:41,459
Nothing to write home about.

1266
01:39:42,047 --> 01:39:45,210
Axel, you can't fool me.
I know exactly what it means.

1267
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:49,003
Did you hear about Keun?

1268
01:39:50,005 --> 01:39:52,246
He's been shot dead
while he was on the run.

1269
01:39:52,506 --> 01:39:54,046
They're all in a hurry.

1270
01:39:54,715 --> 01:39:58,578
It's not going to last. Anytime soon,
we'll go to the front by subway.

1271
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:02,295
Be careful.
Don't forget to go to the shelter.

1272
01:40:02,505 --> 01:40:05,540
Get some warm clothes
and don't smoke too much.

1273
01:40:05,964 --> 01:40:08,916
Ah yes, the cigarette coupons.

1274
01:40:09,631 --> 01:40:11,786
My god, the cigarette coupons!

1275
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:15,454
It all started like this.

1276
01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:17,663
The umbrella, the tapestry.

1277
01:40:18,735 --> 01:40:21,292
Have a drink with your old company.

1278
01:40:21,505 --> 01:40:25,085
Surgical Schnaps. 60% of alcohol.
Just what one needs to die a heroic death.

1279
01:40:25,298 --> 01:40:27,620
Sorry, it's a soldiers' joke.

1280
01:40:28,048 --> 01:40:29,541
- Thanks.
- What happened?

1281
01:40:29,755 --> 01:40:32,161
You're sent to the front
as a skirmisher!

1282
01:40:32,381 --> 01:40:34,289
I assume you got into a fight
with the brass then?

1283
01:40:34,506 --> 01:40:37,172
- I guess you could put it that way.
- Don't worry.

1284
01:40:37,381 --> 01:40:40,047
Rumor has it that the battlefront
we're sent to as reinforcement

1285
01:40:40,255 --> 01:40:43,372
is in shambles.
We're not going to make it.

1286
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:44,998
What are you babbling about?

1287
01:40:45,214 --> 01:40:48,496
He's shedding tears of joy while
drinking down the cup to the last drop.

1288
01:40:49,006 --> 01:40:51,708
- Third company, get on the train!
- Come on.

1289
01:40:55,797 --> 01:40:58,579
What was I about to say...

1290
01:41:00,256 --> 01:41:02,081
There's something I wanted to say too.

1291
01:41:03,964 --> 01:41:07,459
Good luck, Axel!

1292
01:41:08,464 --> 01:41:11,794
Come back to me in one piece!
The sooner the better.

1293
01:41:11,965 --> 01:41:14,169
Of course. Don't cry.

1294
01:41:14,798 --> 01:41:17,546
I won't shed any tears, I promise.

1295
01:41:35,090 --> 01:41:37,329
<i>Heil Hitler, little cousin!</i>

1296
01:41:37,609 --> 01:41:38,667
Thomas!

1297
01:41:42,298 --> 01:41:45,331
Things look dodgy, my girl.
Now listen to me very carefully.

1298
01:41:45,755 --> 01:41:47,642
I'm not drunk!

1299
01:41:47,922 --> 01:41:50,493
Get in the car and please
don't make any fuss.

1300
01:41:50,715 --> 01:41:52,255
Leave all your stuff.
No need to worry about that.

1301
01:41:52,423 --> 01:41:56,581
We're going to Stockholm. Silk stockings
are prettier there and less expensive.

1302
01:41:56,798 --> 01:41:59,167
- I don't understand.
- That's not necessary. Trust me!

1303
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:01,336
Be kind and tactful!

1304
01:42:01,547 --> 01:42:03,621
I have to go home,
the rent is due...

1305
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:06,327
I'll pay the rent
through the Fuhrer's chancellery.

1306
01:42:07,596 --> 01:42:10,045
You don't want to go home.
The Gestapo is waiting for you.

1307
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:16,808
Thank you, Thomas! Thank you

1308
01:42:21,006 --> 01:42:22,808
Excuse me.

1309
01:42:23,715 --> 01:42:26,702
- I know you.
- Yes?

1310
01:42:26,881 --> 01:42:30,663
You're the inspector
who arrested Bruno Ludke.

1311
01:42:30,965 --> 01:42:33,535
I just wanted to know
what happened to him.

1312
01:42:33,944 --> 01:42:35,876
He never came home.

1313
01:42:36,298 --> 01:42:38,423
Who are you talking about?

1314
01:42:38,631 --> 01:42:39,881
I know you.

1315
01:42:40,005 --> 01:42:42,293
You're the one who arrested him.

1316
01:42:43,258 --> 01:42:45,215
Bruno Ludke?

1317
01:42:46,051 --> 01:42:48,290
You're mistaken sister.

1318
01:42:48,864 --> 01:42:52,146
Bruno Ludke never existed!

1319
01:43:00,506 --> 01:43:05,045
<i>Wheels shall roll for victory</i>

1320
01:43:36,339 --> 01:43:38,211
<i>We hereby inform you</i>

1321
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:42,077
<i>that Mr Ludke has been executed
yesterday in the afternoon</i>

1322
01:43:42,256 --> 01:43:44,411
<i>in compliance with your orders. </i>

1323
01:43:44,589 --> 01:43:47,256
<i>He died at 3. 31pm</i>

1324
01:44:02,616 --> 01:44:04,690
<i>Case closed</i>
