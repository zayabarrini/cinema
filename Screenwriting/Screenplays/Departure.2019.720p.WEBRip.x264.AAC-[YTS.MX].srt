00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,848
Yes. He fell asleep.

She's fine.
- What an asshole.

00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,643

When are you going to stop
acting like a fucking child?

looks like you survived
a rough night last night.

115
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,665
Yeah, you could say that.

116
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,794
All right guys, enjoy.

117
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,129
Thanks, buddy.

We can play a couple of hands.

128
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,945
I need it now.

129
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,948
I don't have it now.
I got a business to run.

130
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,742
Well, that's your problem.

131
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,371
I'm not gonna run off

I'll be back at 3.

You either got the money,

135
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,924
or I'll take this piece of junk
and strip it for parts.

136
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,176
Don't fuck with me.

Well, do you have any idea
where she might be?

Okay, well, uh,

145
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,840
could you come over here?

146
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,468
All right, thanks.

147
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,858
What's going on?

148
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,777
I can't find my money.

149
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,571
What money?

150
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,865
Just money that I saved.

151
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,202
You think someone broke in?

152
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,037
No.
[sighs]

153
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,207
Loretta and I got into it last night,

154
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,376
and I keep hoping she hid it
somewhere to fuck with me.

155
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,181
Look, this is between you two.

156
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,517
I gotta go.

157
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,061
Come on.

158
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,480
Did she say anything to you?

159
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,358
You owe someone again,
don't you?

160
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,029
You fucking serious?

161
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,033
Are you gonna help me or not?

162
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,410
It's a small town, Robert;
you'll figure it out.

163
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,247
[door closes]

164

Sam!

166
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,011
What do you want, Robert?

167
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,429
I'm lookin' for Loretta.

168
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,848
So?

169
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,349
Come on, man.

170
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,685
What do you want from me?

171
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,978
Cut the bullshit!

172
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,354
I gotta find her!

173
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,982
What the fuck?

174
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,026
What's going on here?

175
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,444
You trying to embarrass me
in front of the guys?

176
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,821
Where is she?

177
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,739
Don't bring your family problems
into my gym!

178
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,576
Dude, you brought my
family problems into this gym!

179
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,744
Don't blame me for your fuck-ups.

180
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,583
Man, you have no idea
what's going on.

181
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,419
And if I find out you had anything
to do with this,

182
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,796
I'm gonna burn this place
to the fucking ground.

183
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,464
Oh please.

184
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,258
Go ahead, pussy.

185
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,198
What the fuck?

186
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,578
You let them take the truck?

187
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,079
What are you talking about? Who?

188
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,087
What the fuck, Melissa?

189
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,881
I'm sorry I wasn't guarding the truck

190
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,091
while you left me here
alone during lunch!

191
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,511
Where are you going now?

192
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,722
I got to get it back!

193
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,525
Robert, I need to talk to you.

194
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,235
Yeah, not now.
I got stuff going on.

00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,154
It's about Loretta.

196
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,617
Oh, yeah, where the fuck is she?

00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,372
Umm,

198
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,666
there was a situation
at the lake.

199
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,042
Okay.

200
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,877

[dramatic music]

202
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,090
And it was empty.

203
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,634
What are you talking about?

204
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,678
Umm,

205
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,931
What?

206
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,266
There was a suicide note.

207
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,420
Hey, what's up?

208
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,423
It's Loretta.

209
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,183

214
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,657

[groans]

216
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,994
What, come on it's not like
they're not going to take you

217
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,370
because of your hair color.

218
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,503
Hey, hey, hey no.
What, are you nuts?

219
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,379
Anne.

220
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,673
Can I use some paint thinner
or something instead—

221
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,217
No! That shit'll ruin your head.

222
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,302
Well, what am I supposed to do?

223
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,012
I look like an idiot.

[sighs]

225
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,945
Does this actually work?

226
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,781
[chuckling]
It's worth a shot.

Are you gonna miss me?

00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,996
I made dinner.

260
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,789
Don't look so surprised.

261
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,294
What did you do to your hair?

262
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,505
It looks nice.

263
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,384
Where'd you get it done?

264
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,928
Just at a friend's.

265
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,721
You're not hanging out with that

266
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,097
Elvis "Pervesly" again, are you?

267
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,933

What are you talking about?

283
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,686
- When are you gonna stop acting
like a fucking child?

284
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,604
Get the fuck off me.

285
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,523
- Come on, nothing happened, okay?

286
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,816
I know what I'm doing with my money.

287
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,192

Don't lie to me, Annie.

306
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,843
I know about the Navy.

307
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,303
Honestly, what's wrong with you?

308
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,222
You're gonna turn down
a full scholarship?

309
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,557
Look, you really don't understand.

310
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,850
What is it that I don't understand?

311
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,810
You're wasting a huge opportunity!

312
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,520
Okay, I don't need your help, okay?

313
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,313

Oh.

00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,926
If I drive there,
it'll take up my whole day.

Well, tell Sam you'll
do it tomorrow.

328
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,513
He'll get someone else
if I don't do it today.

329
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,016
Okay, let me borrow your truck then.

330

No, I gotta go now
before my mom finds out

Where the hell you been?
We've been waiting

so I'm handling everything.

348
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,406
What do you need?

349
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,534
She just needs a car
for just like a day or two.

(Ricky)
These have been here the longest.

351
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,716
Nobody's gonna care if one disappears
for a couple of days.

352
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,510
How much?

353
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,304
Three hundred a day.

354
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,598
Oh, come on you're shitting me, right?

355
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,142
It'd be one thing if you were driving,

356
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,102
but I don't think Robert's gonna be
too happy when he finds—

357
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,395
I can get the money.

358
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,193
Okay, then.

359
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,407
Uh, you can just drop me off here.

360
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,495
We have to hurry, okay?

361
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,595
Shit.

Let's go.

363
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,361
Did you get it?

364
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,624
Uh, maybe we can convince him
some other way,

365
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,542
like give him collateral
or something like that?

366
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,462
What? No, he's not the kind of guy
that makes deals or anything like that.

367
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,089
We have to do something, okay?

368
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,466
Look. I'll take you tomorrow.

She got out again.

554
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,473
- Is she okay?- I fired Adam.

555
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,849
Yes, he fell asleep.

556
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,184
She's fine.
- What an asshole.

557
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,478
She had this one her.
I think it's yours.

Yeah, thank you.

00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,692
You think maybe you can
take care of her tomorrow,

after the hospital?

562
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,737
I already promised that
I would help out at the pound.

563
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,322
Well, I don't have any options.

564
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,282
You think you can help me out this once?

565
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,784
- You can't call in sick or something?
- No, I cannot call in sick,

(Emily)
I don't understand,
she remembers me.

593
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,355
She remembers Loretta.

594
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,982
She remembers my dad sometimes.

595
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,400
(Doctor)
I know.

596
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,735
It's a really hard decision,

difficult position.

598
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,157
But you need to think about
what's best for her right now,

599
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,659
and keeping her safe.

600
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,580

You're welcome.
Let me know what I can do.

I am not putting her in a home.

Em, we gotta do what's best for her.

604

I'm taking care of her myself.

605
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,804
Did you hear what the doctor said?

606
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,139
She needs her daughters,
not some stranger

607
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,599
that doesn't give a shit.

608
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,891
That's not what's happening here.

Why do you care anyway?
She's living with me.

610
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,186
She's staying with you
because you insisted on it.

611
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,605
It doesn't mean that I don't care.

612
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,732
You care now because you've
taken us to the doctor once?

613

And paying a kid to
fall asleep on the job,

614
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,693
that's doing it?
- At least I give a shit.

615
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,987

00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,496
we got a call from the
boathouse up at Burr Oak.

739
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,331
Potential theft.
Can you take a look?

00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,666
Over.

741

Well, Tim rented a boat earlier today

746
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,666
to a young lady for an hour.

747
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,710
It's been four hours now,
and she hasn't come back.

748
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,587

Maybe we'll find something.

Maybe not. Who knows?

754
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,053
Okay?

755
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,980
We don't know anything yet,

756
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,565
so don't assume too much.

757
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,442
I need to check the lake house

758
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,860

759
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,530
Brian's already taking care of that.

760

00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:33,278
But, Joe Frazier was in the crowd,
and he felt so bad for me

811
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,154
that he sent his boys up
with a box of Cubans.

812
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:37,740
Like a fancy box, fancy lighter,
the whole works.

813
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,367

you weren't supposed to inhale.

nobody told me anything.
