00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,000
THE THIEF

2
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,360
I was born just after the war...

3
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,800
...in 1946.

4
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,200
My mother was going to see
some relatives in Jaroslavl'...

5
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,800
...and she gave birth to me
on the side of the road.

6
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,240
I never saw my father.

7
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,720
He came back
from the war wounded...

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,480
...and died six months before
I was born.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,680
But I thought about him...

10
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,840
...throughout my childhood.

11
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,280
I tried to imagine him.

12
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,080
THE THIEF

13
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,480
In 1952, I was six.

14
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,320
My memory then confused...

15
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,600
...what I saw and understood
after that.

16
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,280
But I knew
I'd remember that train...

17
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,360
...for the rest of my life.

18
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,400
Get rid of one.

19
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,800
- What should I get rid of?
- Hearts.

20
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,160
Hearts... I don't have any.

21
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,160
- Mommy!
- What?

22
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,440
Can I go up there?

23
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,160
You're not allowed.

24
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,120
But there's nobody up there.

25
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,600
There was just a stop,
maybe someone's coming.

26
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,360
So who is the queen married to?

27
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,480
The jack or the king?

28
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,640
The queen?

29
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,960
That's enough, I've had it.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,160
Hello.

31
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,760
Hello.

32
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,840
Let's play some more.

33
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,760
Cards, huh?

34
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,920
Just like at home.

35
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,360
Come on.

36
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,040
I've been robbed!

37
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,160
- Where are you going without shoes?
- What's going on?

38
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,920
A woman was robbed.

39
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,480
People.

40
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,120
Stay in your seat.

41
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,040
- I'm going, you stay here.
- Mom, please!

42
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,040
Listen, squirt.

43
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,480
Here you go.

44
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,800
What are you doing?
Don't worry.

45
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,680
Keep an eye on my stuff, okay?

46
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,520
Excuse me.

47
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,120
Excuse me, let us through.

48
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,240
Why cry? It's too late.

49
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,080
Shall we have a smoke?

50
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,560
Are you crazy!

51
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,840
What's your name?

52
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Mine?

53
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Katja.

54
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,880
Daddy!

55
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,080
Where are you going?

56
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,480
Well... I don't know.

57
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,680
We got off with Uncle Toljan
in some random city.

58
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,360
My mom said that from then on
we would live with him...

59
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,880
...and that I would have
to call him Dad.

60
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
We walked through the city...

61
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,240
...looking for a room
or a small apartment to rent.

62
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,840
Do you have a room?

63
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,480
The accountant and his wife
live there.

64
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,480
An engineer and his daughter, there.

65
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,640
Here's the kitchen.

66
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,160
The bathroom.

67
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,680
An artist lives here,
my husband and I there.

68
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,360
Varvara teaches the accordion there.

69
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,000
A drunk woman lives in there,
but she's harmless.

70
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,600
The room isn't mine,
it's my sister Anna's.

71
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,560
She's in the hospital now.

72
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,520
And I'm Aunt Tanja.

73
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Sanjec'ka.

74
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,040
Aunt Tanja.

75
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,200
I'll give you the down payment
in a few days.

76
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,560
My housing money and passport
are at the military headquarters.

77
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,560
You know how the army is.

78
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,720
Okay.

79
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,400
Whenever.

80
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,600
You're a father, a soldier.

81
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
- You're not a con artist.
- Thanks.

82
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,920
No problem.

83
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,360
Mommy!

84
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,800
What's wrong? Calm down.

85
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,800
It's nothing, honey.

86
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,240
- What's wrong, Sanja?
- It's nothing.

87
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,720
He'll go back to sleep now.

88
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,080
Now Daddy will tie the chairs
together so you won't fall.

89
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,160
He was choking you?

90
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,840
What are you saying?

91
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,840
I heard it, you know?

92
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,760
You were dreaming.

93
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,440
I'm sleeping here!

94
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,240
Not on your life!

95
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,920
Lie down here.

96
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,400
I'm staying with mommy.

97
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,920
Goddammit!

98
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,840
I sleep here.

99
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,520
If you say another word,
I'll throw you out the window!

100
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,120
You don't believe me?

101
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,120
So?

102
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,240
Don't worry.

103
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,080
Put a nail up.

104
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,640
Why?

105
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,240
To hang up your uniform.

106
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
Okay, I'll put it up myself.

107
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,480
And what are these?

108
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,480
They're for you,
I bought them at the market.

109
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,600
Just for me?

110
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,440
For you, for you.

111
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,160
For me?

112
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,280
It's for me?

113
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,360
It doesn't fit.

114
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,080
Stop it.

115
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,680
Stop it, get out.

116
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,960
And don't make any noise,
or they'll send us away.

117
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,600
Your passport isn't at headquarters.
You never went there.

118
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,840
I'm on leave.
I have two days left.

119
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,520
If you bring it to the woman,
she'll know I'm not your wife.

120
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,360
So what?

121
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,360
So what? She'll kick us out!

122
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,640
She won't kick us out.

123
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,440
You're Sasha?

124
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,080
My name is Inessa Pavlovna.

125
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,160
Are you the drunk?

126
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
No.

127
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,240
- I haven't had a drink in a month.
- Sanja! Go out and play!

128
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,840
I don't want to!

129
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,440
It seems the girl liked me.

130
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,880
She thought they beat me up
because of her.

131
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,880
In fact they beat me up
because I was different.

132
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,640
I don't want to live here!
They beat me up!

133
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
What's wrong?
They'll throw us out for sure.

134
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,320
Don't yell.

135
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,560
Why are you a tattletale?
Show 'em.

136
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,160
What do you mean, Uncle Toljan?

137
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,240
I'm not your uncle, I'm Daddy!
Go and defend yourself!

138
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,640
Defend myself... But how?

139
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,760
Use your fists, bite, kick.

140
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,520
This way, they'll remember.

141
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,000
If not, you're not a real man.
Now turn off the water.

142
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
Caterina!

143
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,400
Are you there? Come and see
what your son has done!

144
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,840
What a mess!

145
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,440
You shouldn't have
rented it to them, with a child!

146
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,480
That's not a rag,
it's a towel!

147
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,040
Sorry.

148
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,840
Hey, asshole, come out here!

149
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,440
Listen!

150
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,080
Is this your son who's been
hitting these kids with a stick?

151
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,600
He's crazy!

152
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,120
Discipline him, dammit!

153
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,880
Let go of his ear...

154
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,240
...or I'll come down there...

155
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,080
...and smash your face in.

156
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,000
Go ahead, come on down!

157
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,920
They move in and you can't
let the kids play...

158
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,240
...in the courtyard anymore!

159
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,640
Okay, okay.
Can't you take a joke?

160
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,840
I'm coming down and I'm going
to smash his face in. Just wait.

161
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,400
He throws rocks!

162
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,160
Little brat!

163
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,080
If you touch him again,
I'm going to smash your face in!

164
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,360
Are these the guys
who beat you up?

165
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,840
Did you defend yourself?

166
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,720
Did he beat you up?
And you?

167
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,560
Punch him.

168
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,720
I said hit him!

169
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Come on!

170
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,800
Again!

171
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,760
Hit him again!

172
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,280
On the nose, in his face!

173
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,360
Pound him!

174
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,960
Okay, okay.

175
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,920
Now calm down.
We're leaving.

176
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,120
I should whip you.
You flooded the whole house!

177
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,720
Sit down!

178
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,840
Get me the belt.

179
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,600
Give it to me, I said!

180
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,840
I forgive you.

181
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,320
Don't worry,
I'm going to beat him.

182
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,320
Why do you want to hit him?

183
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,840
It's better to teach him the accordion.
I don't ask for much.

184
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,080
What accordion! He's a pest!

185
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Learning how to play the accordion
wouldn't hurt.

186
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,080
But his father's a soldier.
Today we're here, tomorrow there.

187
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,680
I would never have married a soldier.

188
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,120
Really?

189
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,880
Sure, she'd never
have gotten married!

190
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,120
Look at her!

191
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,400
Touch it.

192
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,480
Harder.

193
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,160
Understand?

194
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,040
And this?

195
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,480
It's to scare people.

196
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,560
If you scare them, they respect you
and they listen to you.

197
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,840
- And if they don't listen?
- Pummel them.

198
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
And if they're stronger than you?

199
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,240
Whoever it is,
you have to tell yourself:

200
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,520
"I'm ready to kill
for this cigarette...

201
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,200
...for this ice cream. "

202
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,600
The others understand that, and
they will give you anything. Understand?

203
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,080
Is that Stalin?

204
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,760
Why?

205
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,600
He's my father.

206
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,280
Sure.

207
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,520
Really?

208
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Sure.

209
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,560
And he... Does he know?

210
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
Yes.

211
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,560
But it's a secret.

212
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,640
Don't tell anyone, understand?

213
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,080
- Yes.
- It's a secret then, squirt.

214
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,080
I hope it's okay...

215
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,000
Feel how my heart is beating.

216
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,120
And you? Are you happy now?

217
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,040
Go tell the neighbors you're sorry
before they throw us out.

218
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,720
Go on!

219
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,040
Go, Sanja.

220
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,200
Do you have kids?

221
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,200
We had them.

222
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,040
We all had children once:

223
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,720
Solomonich, Inessa, us.

224
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,920
Where did they go?
Did they die in the war?

225
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,480
Yes.

226
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Look, the sole has worn away.

227
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,760
They're old shoes.

228
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,280
Not like your father's...

229
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,840
...made of calfskin, new.

230
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,680
He's not my father.

231
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,120
- So who is he?
- Uncle Watchamacallit!

232
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,120
Sanja, where are you?
Come home!

233
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,120
You're an idiot!

234
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,240
You could have looked
at his passport at least.

235
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,000
And what would I have done with it?

236
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Anyway, he's a soldier.
We can always call headquarters.

237
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,600
Good morning, lovely ladies.

238
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,040
Please, help yourselves.

239
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,000
Aunt Tanja, have one.

240
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,760
- What luxury! What do we owe-
- We have to celebrate.

241
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,600
Speaking of which,
how do we want to celebrate?

242
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,000
To each his own.

243
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,680
It's better to celebrate together!

244
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,120
I'll be in charge of organizing it.

245
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,160
- And don't cry, Aunt Tanja.
- I'll bring our daily bread!

246
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,920
No, no.

247
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,920
- None for her.
- No way.

248
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,880
Comrades...

249
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,640
...as a soldier, I travel a lot
and meet a lot of people.

250
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,560
But I have never met people...

251
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,560
...as kind and friendly as you.

252
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,400
For this reason...

253
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,800
...accept as a sign of gratitude...

254
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,320
...tickets for the circus!

255
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,840
For Saturday!
We'll go together.

256
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,240
You're crazy to spend so much!

257
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,760
We are touched, really.
We'd love to come.

258
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,280
Especially on Saturday!

259
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,720
To your health.

260
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,960
Why are we sitting?
You men could ask us to dance.

261
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,080
May I?

262
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,640
- I can't come to the circus.
- Why not?

263
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,680
I have a play on Saturday.

264
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,840
And then?

265
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,520
Some like to meddle
in other people's affairs.

266
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,480
David Solomonich, a toast.

267
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,520
I would like to toast...

268
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,120
...the man who made this day possible...

269
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,200
...and not just this.

270
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,320
To the good, the wise...

271
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,880
...the best of all men.

272
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,080
To Comrade Stalin.

273
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,680
I also have to drink to his honor.

274
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,880
What is this stuff?

275
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,800
Water!

276
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,320
I know you too well.
I've lived with you too long!

277
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,680
Know what I think?

278
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,440
When you're big,
you're going to marry me.

279
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,280
Nice, huh!

280
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,600
What time does Olga
usually come home?

281
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,400
It depends.

282
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,840
I understand.

283
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,880
Saniec'ka, I have to go out
for a minute.

284
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,800
Don't go.
Please, don't go away.

285
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
I'm just going to the bathroom,
and then I'll be back.

286
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,080
You promised me we would go back.

287
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
- I'm not coming!
- Be good!

288
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,760
You're a liar!

289
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,840
Sasha, maybe we have to leave.

290
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,720
- Right now? And Uncle Toljan?
- I don't know.

291
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,440
No... Stay here, I'll be right back.

292
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,960
- What did you come here for?
- To get my things.

293
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,800
I'm leaving.

294
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,120
So take your things then.

295
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,200
You knew it, right?

296
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,600
What are you doing?

297
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,920
But what...

298
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,440
What are you looking for?

299
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,280
What are you doing?
I don't understand!

300
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,800
- Where is your Olga?
- What fucking Olga?

301
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,400
Get the boy, otherwise
we'll miss our train.

302
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,120
- So then you're not a soldier.
- I am, actually.

303
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,520
They stick my rank on my ass,
and they even give me a title!

304
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,040
And I thought that now...

305
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
...we would live together.

306
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,080
I love you.

307
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,640
And you...

308
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,480
- I did it for the boy too...
- Tell me about it later!

309
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,920
Let's go.

310
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,480
- Don't take anything, let's go.
- What? Look what a mess!

311
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,880
I beg you!

312
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,240
I love you.
We have a child to raise...

313
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,880
C'mon, we'll miss our train.

314
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,640
Why am I so unlucky?

315
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,480
Let's go, the train's leaving.

316
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,920
Think about it later.
Now let's go.

317
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,600
No!

318
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,720
Then leave me the address.

319
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,800
Maybe I'll write you from prison.

320
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,480
You know...

321
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,160
I have no address.

322
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,280
C'mon, squirt.

323
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,440
Here you go, chief. All set.

324
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,480
- Did you look at it?
- All set.

325
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,160
- Mommy.
- Be quiet.

326
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,320
Mommy, look!

327
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,720
This is mine!

328
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,720
Give it to me! Give it to me, I said!

329
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,760
Be quiet.

330
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,600
Leave them alone.

331
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,120
If they ask,
it's not our stuff.

332
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,320
Would you like tea?

333
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,960
Everything's fine, Katiusha!
Now we can enjoy ourselves!

334
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,320
Oh, my sweetheart...

335
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,480
I love you so...

336
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,680
Listen to my love song...

337
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,680
You are my happiness...

338
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,200
Oh, my sweetheart...

339
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,280
I love you so...

340
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,960
I hate you!

341
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,640
Take it.

342
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,520
Never, ever.

343
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,240
You'll take it and then tomorrow
you'll go to the market and sell it.

344
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,280
Me?

345
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
Here!

346
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,680
And so I saw the Black Sea
for the first time.

347
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,640
Good morning, comrades.

348
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,920
Who's in charge here?

349
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,440
My wife and son are down there.

350
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,720
Comrade Captain!

351
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,760
- Comrade Captain!
- C'mon, let's go...

352
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,240
Put the bags in the left luggage.
Hurry!

353
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,000
It would have been better
if you hadn't come back.

354
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,280
Liar.

355
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,720
"Shipr. "

356
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,320
- What?
- Shipr cologne.

357
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,080
- We'd like to rent a room.
- We're no trouble.

358
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,680
My husband is in the service,
my son is well-behaved.

359
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,080
Yes, I understand, but...

360
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,440
...we don't rent.

361
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,520
Too bad.

362
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,600
But there's a collective apartment
in the basement.

363
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,440
I think they rent there.

364
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,520
Katja.

365
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
Are you sleeping?

366
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,960
No.

367
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,040
What's wrong?

368
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,480
What's wrong with her?

369
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,240
Bring her some water.

370
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,600
- Stop! You new here?
- Yes!

371
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,720
Hello...

372
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,960
- Don't you say hi? Your name?
- I'll kill you, damn you!

373
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,160
Are you a new tenant?

374
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,840
Yes.

375
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,840
- Don't you say hello?
- Hello.

376
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,080
What's wrong, Katja?

377
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,520
I'm scared, Toljan.

378
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,320
What do I do with it?

379
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,760
Drink it. Actually, go out
and check things out.

380
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,120
Take a good look, then tell me.

381
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,120
Stop giving him lessons!
Do you want him to become like you?

382
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,880
What's wrong with that?

383
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,880
Sanja, want to become a soldier?

384
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,160
Yes.

385
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,560
Good. Now get out!

386
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,480
You promised it was
the last time...

387
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,240
...and then we would have
a normal life!

388
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,200
You were the one who said
you'd write me from jail!

389
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,280
If I keep going like this,
I'll end up like you.

390
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,720
And who will I send postcards to?
My son in the orphanage?

391
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,880
Don't yell!

392
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,200
I haven't made money in a while.

393
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,880
I always find poor people's houses.
One good deal, and then I'll stop.

394
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,480
Just my luck!

395
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,040
Get rid of this crap!
I have a boy to feed!

396
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,080
- Here, Uncle Toljan!
- I told you to call me Daddy!

397
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,560
Say it! Daddy!

398
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,160
Stop it!

399
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,600
I'll kill you!

400
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,200
Go ahead.

401
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,640
You know the rules of the game?

402
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,640
If you pull a knife,
you have to use it.

403
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,720
Go ahead.

404
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,880
Otherwise I'll hit you.

405
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,960
Leave me alone!

406
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,120
Sanja, are you in there?

407
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,320
Stay in there, it's good for you!

408
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,080
Citizens!

409
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,560
Do you have an accordion?
The soul needs music.

410
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,600
Do you have an accordion?

411
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,440
Good idea, putting the bed
between two night tables!

412
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,440
Will you avenge me, my son?

413
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,280
Daddy!

414
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,720
C'mon, Comrade, play.

415
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,080
The night is short.

416
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,200
At least tell us
why we're celebrating.

417
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,800
Really, Anatolij,
please tell us.

418
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,240
It's my birthday.

419
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,560
Citizens...

420
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,560
...this is what I want to say:

421
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,840
I liked you right from the start,
like a family.

422
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,440
- And for this reason-
- There'll be no circus.

423
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,600
For this reason...

424
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,720
I want to drink with you
to Comrade Stalin.

425
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,080
Hello.

426
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,680
- What's wrong with your hand?
- Nothing. I smashed it.

427
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,280
But you're hurt.

428
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,800
We need some iodine.

429
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,320
I have some at home. C'mon.

430
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,040
C'mon!

431
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,600
Come in.

432
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,320
My husband...

433
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,920
...is a very important doctor.

434
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,000
He amputates all the time,
24 hours a day.

435
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,840
He's always at work.

436
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,680
I have lots of free time.

437
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,120
You're not any trouble.

438
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,720
Give me your hand.

439
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,200
We'll clean it up.

440
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,800
Does it hurt?

441
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,560
Does it burn?

442
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,400
You have to disinfect it,
otherwise you could get tetanus.

443
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,000
- What is it?
- What?

444
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,480
Tetanus.

445
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,520
Tetanus is...

446
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,080
I don't even know.

447
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,520
It's something...

448
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,200
...dangerous.

449
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,920
- Who is it?
- Call the soldier uncle!

450
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,920
- He's not here.
- Call him!

451
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,960
Do you understand Russian
or not?

452
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,720
Tell him his son has climbed up
the fire escape...

453
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,800
...and can't get down.

454
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,640
If he doesn't come right away,
we'll call his mother, got it?

455
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,600
There you are!

456
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,920
- No!
- Don't worry, I'll be careful.

457
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,440
There he is!

458
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,560
So, squirt,
what should I do?

459
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,160
Leave you here?

460
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,400
You need an escort!

461
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,200
Look, look!

462
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,960
Hold on, squirt.

463
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,360
"Shipr"...

464
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,880
Your mother will show us "Shipr".

465
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,960
What are you doing?
What are you doing there?

466
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,760
We're going to the bathhouse.

467
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,760
Take some straw and scrub your ass.

468
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,680
Like that. Like me.

469
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,840
Don't worry, squirt.

470
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,920
If you're brave, yours will grow too.

471
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,880
I'll pour the water on you.

472
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,960
You peed in your pants.
Don't worry about it.

473
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,720
It happens to everyone.

474
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,880
One time...

475
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,400
I pissed blood for three days.

476
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,560
Blood?

477
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,760
Five people...

478
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,400
...kicked me in the kidneys
with their boots.

479
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,240
- Who?
- It happened.

480
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,920
They hit me here, and here.

481
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,080
They broke my ribs,
but I didn't say a word.

482
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,360
I didn't speak.

483
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,200
I lay in the blood for three days,
like a stuck pig.

484
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,520
Just remember, squirt.

485
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,280
You can pee in your pants 100 times,
but then you have to win.

486
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,200
Understand? Good boy.

487
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,360
Another one?

488
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,040
Go get another beer.
Go on, hurry.

489
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,360
Friends, today is my lucky day!

490
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,280
- Want some bread with salt?
- Your turn!

491
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,480
Look, I have another ten
and the ace of spades!

492
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,320
Wait a minute!
I have the ace of spades too!

493
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,560
Bastard!

494
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,280
They're fighting in there.

495
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,480
- Documents, Captain.
- You want documents too!

496
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,960
- Documents.
- What are you talking about, guys?

497
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,160
- Documents, I said.
- Take a look then.

498
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,840
They cooked me alive in the tanks,
I rotted in the swamps...

499
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,320
...and I fought on the front lines,
so you could ask for my documents?

500
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,680
Stop it!

501
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,920
Documents for you, shithead?
Here!

502
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,520
I should show them to him!

503
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,520
Go to hell! We're just wasting time.

504
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,280
That's it, good boys, go on.

505
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,480
Always carry a little salt with you.
It can come in handy.

506
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,880
Give me your hand.

507
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,920
This is our neighbor, Rosa L'vovna.

508
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,520
Have a seat.

509
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,640
Okay.

510
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,840
Let's go.

511
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,840
Where?

512
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,160
- Climb up, Sanja. I'll follow you.
- Why?

513
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,120
You just have to open the door.

514
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,960
- What are we doing? Stealing?
- What? I'm on a mission.

515
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,200
- What mission?
- A secret mission. Go on.

516
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,880
Sanja! Are you wetting yourself?

517
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,760
Are you a little girl?
Want a bow?

518
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,320
I'm not a little girl.

519
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,840
Hurry up.

520
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,280
There's no time, squirt.

521
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,800
Don't be afraid or we'll fall.

522
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,080
I'm not going up.

523
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,320
We're like thieves.

524
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,320
- They'll put us in prison!
- What's wrong?

525
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,440
Did you sleep too little or eat
too much, squirt? What thieves?

526
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,960
- You know who my father fights?
- Which father? Stalin?

527
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,680
He fights the enemy!

528
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,280
Understand?

529
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,040
An enemy lives up there.

530
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,200
A spy?

531
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,320
I'm on a mission, and you're ruining
everything. Are you an accomplice?

532
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,480
I'm not an accomplice. I swear!

533
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,000
Then prove it!

534
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,200
Prove you're a real Soviet!

535
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,000
But I have to pee.

536
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,120
Hold it in!
You can do it if you're brave.

537
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,760
The lock.

538
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,720
Shake it!

539
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,800
Harder!

540
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,000
You have to do it,
or I won't be able to pull you out!

541
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,320
Push!

542
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,760
You're a weakling, squirt!

543
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,160
Push, or they'll shoot you!

544
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,920
I can't!

545
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,440
Push, I said.

546
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,640
Push!

547
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,800
I'm going to see where he is.

548
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Citizen, I can't see through you.

549
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,360
Sit down.

550
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,360
- Thanks for looking after it for me.
- No problem.

551
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,560
Where's my son?

552
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,480
His father took him with him.

553
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,840
He said to go straight to the station
and wait for him there.

554
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:26,680
Thank you.

555
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,280
Hey! What are you doing up there?

556
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,040
What's your problem, Savel'evna?

557
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,800
Someone must have entered
from the doctor's window.

558
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,800
- Oh come on.
- I'm sure of it!

559
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,080
Call the police,
so they can take a look.

560
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,320
You think?

561
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,200
The windows are dark.
There's no one home.

562
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,280
Savel'evna, everyone's asleep.

563
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,680
You always imagine the same things.

564
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,120
You see thieves everywhere,
bandits.

565
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,040
You need help.

566
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,720
It's open here.

567
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,400
I'm calling the police.
They'll take care of it.

568
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,440
Is this her? Get in!

569
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,880
- Hurry! Let's go!
- Where's Sanja?

570
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,320
C'mon, let's go!

571
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,600
This time it was a fiasco.

572
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,840
Why did you take the boy with you?

573
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,240
Just because.

574
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,600
And then I didn't know
how it'd go with the madame.

575
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,040
We're going to the Molotovka stop.

576
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,040
No one will find us there.
We'll take the train.

577
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:19,320
I'm going to leave you, Toljan.

578
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,800
This time, I'm really going to.

579
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,560
Where?

580
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:31,240
To Ivanovo.
I hear they need workers there.

581
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,760
Then go.

582
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,360
Maybe you'll find someone better.

583
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,440
Maybe...

584
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,560
But I won't love him like you.

585
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,640
Here's the ticket.
One seat, me and the boy.

586
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,000
Seat 15.

587
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,240
Enough. Go on.

588
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,640
Maybe they'll give room and board
at Ivanovo.

589
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,120
- The boy'll go to school. If you-
- Katja, don't start.

590
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:40,360
I like the life I live.
I don't want another one.

591
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,160
Take these to help you get started.

592
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,720
Did you buy these for me
at the market as well?

593
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,600
So, squirt.

594
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,960
Even you want to leave me?

595
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,000
I have your gun in my suitcase.

596
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:22,920
Keep it. I don't need it.
It'll be an excuse to see you again.

597
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,720
Get on!

598
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,200
Go on.

599
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,640
- Sanja!
- Where are you going?

600
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:46,720
Freeze!

601
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,360
Stop or I'll shoot!

602
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,920
Shoot, he's getting away!

603
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,840
Stop!

604
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,880
- What did he do to you?
- He threw salt at me!

605
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,560
The suitcase!

606
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,320
- So why did he escape?
- He ran after the boy.

607
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,640
He thought something
had happened to the boy.

608
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,680
They wanted to check his documents
and he threw salt at the sergeant!

609
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,200
He didn't do it maliciously.
He was injured in the war.

610
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,640
He'll get five years for this,
if he's lucky!

611
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,520
We should knock his head off twice!

612
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,960
Have mercy on him!

613
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,160
How can you leave a boy
without his father?

614
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,200
I'm not moved
by whimpering or by kids.

615
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,240
The sergeant has two.

616
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,760
What if he'd been blinded?

617
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,440
Maybe we can help his family out.

618
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,440
I have a ring and some earrings.
Would you let him go?

619
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,560
I don't know.

620
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,360
After my shift, I'm going to see...

621
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,360
...the sergeant in the hospital.

622
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,800
- I can try to...
- I'll be right back.

623
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,000
- Right away!
- Hurry up!

624
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,800
I'm not going to wait all night.

625
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,520
- Give them to me.
- What?

626
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,160
Where are they?
He gave them to you!

627
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,040
Where are they?

628
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,800
- Here?
- I don't remember!

629
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:48,080
Look for them, Sanja!
I'm asking you in the name of God!

630
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:54,440
We'll surely find them. We have to!
Where could they have gone?

631
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,040
He left.

632
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,920
One moment, citizen.

633
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,760
I don't understand.

634
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,240
You want to bribe me?

635
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,200
Me? Bribe me?

636
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,040
I'll send you to Siberia...

637
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,280
...to cut down trees.

638
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,120
See what they do to you!

639
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,560
Whore!

640
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,920
Get out of here!

641
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,040
Get out before I reconsider.

642
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,800
At least let me see my husband.

643
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,880
They've taken him to the city,
to Molotovskoe.

644
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,160
Look for him there.

645
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,760
Our efforts were in vain.

646
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,680
They didn't find out about
the burglaries in the apartments...

647
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,960
...but they gave him
seven years anyway.

648
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,120
We waited in front of the prison...

649
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,360
...to see him before
the long separation.

650
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:40,240
My mother didn't know
it would be her last time.

651
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:43,960
- Do you know when they call them?
- I don't know.

652
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,760
- When do they call them?
- Who the hell knows?

653
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,560
They don't tell us!

654
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,120
My son, my son...

655
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,560
If you hadn't run away...

656
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,840
...he would be with us now.

657
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,440
Everyone back!

658
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:26,040
If anyone moves, I'll shoot!

659
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,120
Mommy, what does this mean?

660
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:36,400
Number one! Keep your head down!

661
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,480
Number two! Keep your head down!

662
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,640
Vanja! Vanja!

663
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,200
I'm here!

664
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,520
Pasha!

665
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,120
Serozha! Nina had a baby!

666
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,200
What is it?

667
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,400
It's a girl!

668
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,760
Back!

669
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,400
Micola!

670
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,480
Your father died!

671
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,120
Keep your head down!

672
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,360
Toljan!

673
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,840
Sanja!

674
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,320
Daddy! Don't leave us alone!

675
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,840
Daddy!

676
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,480
Don't leave us alone!

677
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,880
From that day on...

678
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,560
I never saw the image
of the soldier...

679
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,920
...of my real father again.

680
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,440
Maybe because on that day...

681
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,360
I betrayed him.

682
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,040
Come with me.

683
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,120
My little boy.

684
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,840
Mom, what's wrong?

685
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,880
- Did you eat?
- I ate.

686
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,280
What?

687
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,960
The cook gave me a potato
and some jam.

688
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,480
Tell her to give you mine too.

689
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,480
Mom, what are you saying?

690
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,520
Does it hurt?

691
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:47,440
What operation is it?

692
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:52,120
They talk about an operation,
but I don't understand.

693
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,040
Ladies' stuff.

694
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,560
What is it?

695
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,400
That's all. Nothing very good.

696
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:05,040
Get well soon.
I'm bored by myself.

697
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,720
I'll get well soon.

698
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,080
Mom, sing me our little song.

699
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,440
Not now, I'm tired.

700
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,680
It was the "Three Witnesses".

701
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,040
My mother died of peritonitis...

702
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,200
...after a botched abortion.

703
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,280
I heard some
of what the doctors said...

704
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,720
...but then I couldn't understand
any of the details...

705
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,040
...and they weren't important.

706
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:47,000
From that moment on
I had no one else in the world...

707
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,840
...closer than Toljan.

708
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,880
My mother's watch and the gun...

709
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,120
...were the only things left
from that life.

710
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,560
Fortunately I was able
to hide the gun.

711
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,320
I hid it often, later...

712
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,040
...in the orphanage.

713
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:09,800
For years, I lived with the dream
that Toljan was free...

714
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,840
...and he would take me away
with him.

715
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,800
Chigariov, straighten your back!

716
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,560
Grab the handlebar. Let's go!

717
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,640
Faster, hurry!

718
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,520
Let's go!

719
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,760
Bastards! Idiots!

720
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:35,560
What are you doing, boy?
You selling a handlebar?

721
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,240
Squirt.

722
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,680
You looking for someone?

723
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,080
You.

724
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:49,760
Me?

725
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,320
Why is that?

726
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,480
I'm Sanja.

727
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,440
So?

728
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,320
I'm Katja's son.
Do you remember Katja?

729
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,920
Which Katja?

730
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,840
On the train, with the little boy.

731
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,160
Wait, wait.
Her name was Katja?

732
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:17,760
And you... So you would be...

733
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,600
You'd be...

734
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,680
Sanja.

735
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,200
- Right, Sanja!
- Toljan!

736
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,920
You're a real piece of work!

737
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,120
You had a kid with Katja
and you don't even remember!

738
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,560
Oh shut up!

739
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:34,880
So...

740
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:36,480
...squirt...

741
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,160
...what do you want?

742
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,920
- You want money?
- For who? You drink with mine!

743
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,760
- Who's this Katja?
- Can't you see I'm talking?

744
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,000
Katja!

745
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,600
Admit it, you old dog!

746
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:50,960
Katja, he says...

747
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,960
C'mon, I fucked one...

748
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,480
...on the train, that's all.

749
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,480
Tell her I'm not
your father, squirt!

750
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,400
You tell her!

751
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,480
Look, look.

752
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:06,760
She's jealous.

753
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,600
I've fallen in love with this one...
like a little boy.

754
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,160
Go to your damn Katja
and take your friends with you!

755
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,720
Good times...

756
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:31,320
Tell your mother I said hello.

757
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,400
Tell her "From Toljan".

758
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,160
She'll remember.

759
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:39,920
Now go on.

760
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:50,920
