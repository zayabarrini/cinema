00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:11,374
Don't you wanna know?

164
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,750
I'm just curious!

165
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,374
Analogue is really making
a comeback. Might be worth lots.

166
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:25,416
Just out of curiosity! I know
a good place in Shimokita.

167
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:30,249
That's not in my direction.

168
00:38:30,249 --> 00:38:34,583
Won't even take us 30 minutes.
Ouch!

169
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:37,333
Should be right here...

170
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:44,209
Here, this is the place.

171
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:46,291
Oops.

172
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:53,958
Hello there.

173
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:58,083
Excuse me,
how much would these make?

174
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:03,000
This one's rare, it's Lou Reed.

175
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,209
120 Dollars for this.
- Seriously?

176
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:10,625
- For this, $80.
- Really?

177
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:15,125
- Where'd you find these?
- These are all my senior's.

178
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:21,042
This one's 40 bucks.

179
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:22,833
For real?

180
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,500
This could go for 60.

181
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,333
You'll make a lot
with all these.

182
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,708
Here's my estimate.

183
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:32,458
Wow, holy shit!

184
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:37,333
Unbelievable!
Let's sell them, Hirayama!

185
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,083
We'll take them all.
Cassettes are in fashion.

186
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,500
Especially from the 70s or 80s.

187
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,666
We gotta sell them,
your whole collection.

188
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,500
120 for this single tape!

189
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,167
Now's the time!

190
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:53,833
OK, just one.
Let's just sell one.

191
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:57,249
Then I can see Aya at the bar.
Tonight's a big deal for me.

192
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,167
It's a big deal tonight!

193
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:09,666
If I miss this chance...

194

Is that it?

195

196

01:08:37,249 --> 01:08:40,833
That's easy.
I'm back to my carefree single days.

That makes any man happy.

Is it?

472
01:28:26,333 --> 01:28:30,333
The world is made up
of many worlds.

473
01:28:32,042 --> 01:28:36,333
Some are connected
and some are not.

474
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,209
My world ...

475
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,167
and your mom's
are very different.

476
01:28:44,917 --> 01:28:46,833
What about my world?

477
01:28:46,833 --> 01:28:48,583

478
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:04,374

into the ocean?

479
01:29:05,333 --> 01:29:07,333
Yeah.
To the ocean.

480
01:29:08,958 --> 01:29:10,083

481
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,833
Next time.

482
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:17,000

Next time is next time.

492
01:29:56,042 --> 01:29:57,625
Now is now.

493
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:00,666
Next time is next time.

494
01:30:00,666 --> 01:30:02,958
Now is now!

495
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:04,750
Next time is next time.

496
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:06,666
Now is now.

497
01:30:40,958 --> 01:30:42,167
Hi, brother.

498
01:30:43,416 --> 01:30:45,167
Long time no see.

499
01:30:48,583 --> 01:30:50,000
So, this is where you live?

500
01:30:51,917 --> 01:30:53,917
I didn't mean it in a bad way.

501
01:30:53,917 --> 01:30:56,167
Niko, get your things.
- No!

502
01:30:56,167 --> 01:30:57,750
That's not an option.

503
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:59,416
Uncle!

504
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:00,875
Hurry now.

505
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:02,000
Uncle!

506
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:05,666
Come back here anytime.

507
01:31:07,167 --> 01:31:09,416
Haven't finished your book yet.

508
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,333
Take it with you.

509
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:19,541
I'm gonna become like Victor.

510
01:31:21,791 --> 01:31:22,917
No, no.

511
01:31:24,374 --> 01:31:27,083
- You shouldn't say that.
- Niko!

512
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,666
For all the trouble.

513
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,500
Your favorite chocolate.

514
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:06,042
She's a good girl.

515
01:32:07,167 --> 01:32:08,458
Not so sure about that.

516
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:13,167
As for father...

517
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:16,917
he no longer recognizes
anything.

518
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,209
Won't you go and visit him
in his nursing home?

519
01:32:21,167 --> 01:32:23,209
He won't act like he used to.

520
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:41,167
Are you really cleaning toilets?

521
01:33:03,833 --> 01:33:04,958
Uncle.

522
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:08,666
Thank you.

523
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:49,500
<i> Hey, it's Takashi.</i>

524
01:35:51,042 --> 01:35:53,333
<i>Takashi speaking. Hello?</i>

525
01:35:53,333 --> 01:35:54,416
I hear you.

526
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:58,666
<i> Hirayama,
you've been good to me.</i>

527
01:35:58,666 --> 01:35:59,791
<i>I really appreciate it.</i>

528
01:35:59,791 --> 01:36:01,333
<i>Like, nine out of ten.</i>

529
01:36:02,458 --> 01:36:05,500
<i>So, it's hard to tell ya,
but I'm quitting.</i>

530
01:36:07,209 --> 01:36:08,333
What?

531
01:36:08,333 --> 01:36:10,249
<i> I'll pay you back
the money soon.</i>

532
01:36:11,249 --> 01:36:13,958
Wait. What about your shift?

533
01:36:27,708 --> 01:36:28,833
Yes.

534
01:36:28,833 --> 01:36:29,833
<i>On such a short notice,</i>

535
01:36:29,833 --> 01:36:31,125
<i>we can't find a replacement.</i>

536
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:34,209
No replacement?
What's gonna happen then?

537
01:36:34,209 --> 01:36:35,666
<i> You'll have to cover
for the day.</i>

538
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:36,666
Heh?

539
01:36:40,666 --> 01:36:42,750
Can I? Sorry, just quick.

540
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:44,167
Sorry.

541
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:48,917
Excuse me!

542
01:36:50,583 --> 01:36:52,625
- Are you new?
- I'll be done soon.

543
01:37:17,333 --> 01:37:18,541
What is it?

544
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:21,000
Where's Takashi?

545
01:38:09,958 --> 01:38:12,666
Three times, I've called.
Why'd no one answer?

546
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:16,917
Listen,
I'm only doing this today.

547
01:38:16,917 --> 01:38:19,083
Just find anyone, got it?

548
01:40:07,833 --> 01:40:10,833
I'm Sato. I was suddenly
asked to come here

549
01:40:10,833 --> 01:40:12,917
and take over
the former staff's shift.

550
01:40:14,042 --> 01:40:15,708
Should I start over there?

551
01:40:15,708 --> 01:40:17,167
Ah, yes.

552
01:43:21,625 --> 01:43:23,541
- Hi.
- Hi.

553
01:44:23,083 --> 01:44:26,374
Remember what used to be here?

554
01:44:27,583 --> 01:44:28,500
Huh?

555
01:44:33,042 --> 01:44:36,666
That's what growing old means.

556
01:45:10,666 --> 01:45:15,416
Patricia Highsmith knows
everything about anxiety.

557
01:45:15,416 --> 01:45:18,000
She made me realize
that fear and anxiety

558
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,666
are different things.

559
01:45:58,042 --> 01:45:59,416
What brings you here?

560
01:46:02,333 --> 01:46:03,458
Oh, you know ...

561
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:10,083
May I?

562
01:46:13,583 --> 01:46:14,500
Come in.

563
01:46:48,666 --> 01:46:50,291
A pack of 'Peace'.

564
01:46:50,291 --> 01:46:51,291
And a bag.

565
01:48:08,541 --> 01:48:09,917
May I have one?

566
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:48,541
Been a while
since I last smoked.

567
01:48:58,833 --> 01:49:01,209
Did you see us at the bar
earlier?

568
01:49:12,875 --> 01:49:16,666
You always go there, I guess?

569
01:49:16,666 --> 01:49:18,500
Yes.

570
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:22,958
Since it opened,
so, for five or six years.

571
01:49:24,541 --> 01:49:25,500
I see.

572
01:49:27,458 --> 01:49:29,333
It is a nice place.

573
01:49:37,708 --> 01:49:40,042
I'm her ex-husband.

574
01:49:43,333 --> 01:49:45,249
Oh.

575
01:49:45,249 --> 01:49:46,541
I see ...

576
01:49:48,833 --> 01:49:53,666
It's been about seven
years since we got divorced.

577
01:49:53,666 --> 01:49:56,125
I'm married again.

578
01:49:57,875 --> 01:50:00,249
Seven years
since I last saw her.

579
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:02,500
Ah.

580
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,249
I've got cancer.

581
01:50:13,958 --> 01:50:16,000
It metastasized.

582
01:50:19,083 --> 01:50:21,917
My body's
all inflamed from chemo.

583
01:50:28,833 --> 01:50:30,167
Then I...

584
01:50:31,167 --> 01:50:34,333
suddenly felt
I owed her an apology.

585
01:50:34,333 --> 01:50:37,000
Not that anything had happened.

586
01:50:38,833 --> 01:50:40,958
Maybe it wasn't an apology.

587
01:50:43,167 --> 01:50:45,000
I wanted to thank her.

588
01:50:46,625 --> 01:50:48,167
No, that's not it either.

589
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:54,625
I just wanted to see her,
that's all.

590
01:51:07,291 --> 01:51:09,083
Wanna drink?

591
01:51:09,083 --> 01:51:11,541
- Oh no.
- Still got one more.

592
01:51:13,625 --> 01:51:15,291
Well, in that case ...

593
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,666
I'll take one.

594
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,167
Please take care of her.

595
01:51:46,167 --> 01:51:48,167
Oh no, we're not like that.

596
01:51:48,167 --> 01:51:49,958
I'm counting on you.

597
01:51:50,958 --> 01:51:52,583
We're not like that.

598
01:52:06,708 --> 01:52:09,042
Shadows ...

599
01:52:09,042 --> 01:52:11,541
Do they get darker
when they overlap?

600
01:52:16,708 --> 01:52:18,125
Not sure.

601
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,333
So many things
I still don't know ...

602
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:25,209
That's how life ends ...

603
01:52:26,333 --> 01:52:28,000
I guess.

604
01:52:29,583 --> 01:52:30,625
Hmm.

605
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:43,500
Let's find out now.

606
01:52:45,374 --> 01:52:46,500
What?

607
01:52:58,125 --> 01:53:00,374
Try standing here.

608
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,249
Huh?

609
01:53:10,209 --> 01:53:11,500
What do you see?

610
01:53:15,333 --> 01:53:16,666
Looks the same to me.

611
01:53:17,791 --> 01:53:19,083
Not getting darker?

612
01:53:20,249 --> 01:53:21,666
Probably not.

613
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,958
Looks darker to me.

614
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:30,291
Don't see any difference.

615
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:33,500
But there is!

616
01:53:35,209 --> 01:53:37,583
It has to get darker
to make sense!

617
01:53:38,708 --> 01:53:40,042
You're really into this.

618
01:53:42,666 --> 01:53:44,416
Nothing is changing after all?

619
01:53:46,042 --> 01:53:49,249
That's just nonsense.

620
01:53:54,666 --> 01:53:56,083
I agree with that.

621
01:54:08,167 --> 01:54:10,000
Let's play shadow tag.

622
01:54:11,125 --> 01:54:12,209
Huh?

623
01:54:13,167 --> 01:54:14,625
I'll be “It”.

624
01:54:15,666 --> 01:54:16,666
Ready?

625
01:54:17,833 --> 01:54:19,000
Here I come.

626
01:54:20,167 --> 01:54:21,333
Run!

627
01:54:26,791 --> 01:54:28,666
- You alright?
- This is tough.

628
01:54:30,167 --> 01:54:33,042
I'll be “It” now.
- Sure? Ready?

629
01:54:33,042 --> 01:54:34,500
Here I come.

630
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:35,917
Tag!
Tag!

631
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:45,666
So tough.

632
01:54:47,042 --> 01:54:48,583
This is exhausting.
Tag!

633
01:54:50,249 --> 01:54:53,083
That was close.
I stepped on you!

634
01:54:53,083 --> 01:54:54,875
- You did?
- I did.

635
