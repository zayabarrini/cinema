And perhaps I wouldn't be writing it if some devil...
Hadn't made me stop him that night... in the rain.
You want to drown, Henry?
Oh. I wanted a bit of air.
How nice to see you, Bendrix.
How long has it been? A year?
June, 1944.
As long as that.
How's Sarah?
Oh, she's out and about somewhere.
She at the cinema?
No, she never goes.
Hmm. Good night, Henry.
You should go home before you catch your death.
Is something wrong?
Let me take you home, Henry.
[ Bendrix narrating ] or perhaps I wouldn't be writing this...
If I had known then who I hated.
Was it Henry?
Was it his wife, Sarah?
Or was it some other who was yet to be revealed to me?
Sarah?
Sarah?
See, she's out still.
Come upstairs.
Come in.
Let me get you a drink.
Whiskey, thank you.
Whiskey.
So what's troubling you, Henry?
Sarah.
She's out for a walk now,
Bendrix.
A walk.
Well, she always was a great Walker.

[ Chuckles ] of course you think me a fool.
No, Henry.

Keep... picking up this wretched card.
Burn it.
I wish I could.
Well, then go and see-- what's his name? Savage?
And sit where all the other jealous husbands sit?
Do you think they have a waiting room, Bendrix?
Where we see each other's faces as we pass through?
Why not let me go, Henry?
You?
Yes.
I could pretend to be a jealous lover.
Jealous lovers are less ridiculous than jealous husbands.
They're supported by the weight of literature.
Tragic, never comic.
Think of Troilus.
I shan't lose my amour propre when I interview Mr. Savage.
This is ridiculous.
One can't spy on one's wife through a friend...
And have the friend pretend to be her lover.
What else are friends for? you're a good chap, Bendrix.
All I needed was to talk, clear my head.
The name was savage, and the address was 3 vigo passage.
Forget what I've told you.
Doesn't make sense.
I'll see a doctor.

Sarah, this is our neighbor, the novelist chap.
- What on earth is a novelist doing here?
- research.
On what?
On your husband.
I'm trying to write a character who works for the ministry of pensions.
I need to find out his habits, what he drinks before bedtime.
Cocoa, and when.
11:00, isn't it, Sarah?
Unless we're entertaining.
Would you be so kind as to excuse your character?
The ministry needs him.
Unfortunately, it does.
So, tell me.
What?
His secrets.
Henry's a good man,
Mr. Bendrix.
Good men have no secrets.
I was afraid you'd say that.
You see, goodness has so little fictional value.
- What does have fictional value?
- a minister of home security.
Are you saying my husband is fictional? no, I'm saying he could be.
In the right hands.
Oh, dear. This is alarming.
Can we get away from the service for a moment?
You mean change the subject?
I meant fresh air, actually.
Of course.
So how long have you been married?
Is your character married?
Yes, he's been married happily for ten years.
Henry's a perfect model then.
We've been married ten years.
You know that happiness is even harder to write than goodness.
Henry prefers habit to happiness.

Perhaps you and the lady are intimate?
No. I've only seen her once since 1944.
I don't understand.
You said this was a watching case.
Can't one love or hate as long as that?
There's nothing discreditable about jealousy, Mr. Bendrix.

Well, I've come on behalf of the husband.
He thinks she's deceiving him.
She has secrets.

This way, please.
Thank you.
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr., um-- the name's Parkis.
Mmm.
Mr. Savage's man.
Sit down, take a cigarette.
Oh, no, sir.
Not on duty, sir.
Unless, of course, for purposes of concealment.
But you're not on duty now.
Well, in a manner of speaking, yes, sir.
I've just been relieved for half an hour while I make my report.
So there's something to report?
It's not quite a blank sheet.
Have we met somewhere before, sir?
I don't think so.
Well, like I say, sir.
It's not quite a blank sheet.
But then it never is.
Me and my boy, we followed the, uh-- your boy?
My son, sir.
Yeah, I'm...
Teaching him the business.
I mean, a boy can be useful in all sorts of ways.
On the day in question, the party in question went by tube to Piccadilly...
And proceeded to the park Lane hotel.
She seemed quite...
Agitated.
And there met a gentleman with whom she was obviously quite close, since they greeted each other with an affectionate lack of ceremony.
And at one point, although I cannot be certain of this, held hands along the bar.
They held hands?
Yes, sir.
The gentleman pushed the lady's glass towards her, and the hand sort of stayed there for some time, sir, which would certainly indicate a squeeze of that nature.
After a short conversation, they proceeded to a restaurant called, uh,
Palmers, which was difficult to gain access to, me bein' with the boy and all.
But I observed them through the window.
And after a while, the lady left, laborin', well, it seemed to me, under great emotion.
[ Bendrix ] great emotion.
You're sure of that?
Oh, without doubt, sir.
You see, I then followed her down charing cross road to maiden Lane, where she turned into a church for what I can only presume w-w-was a good cry.
She's not a Roman, is she, sir?
No.
[ chuckles ]
Thought not.
She didn't kneel, sir, but sat.
And from the angle of her face,
I could tell...
Forgive the personal touch.
Of course.
You see, I liked the lady, the party in question.
- As did I, but you were wrong about the hands, Mr. Parkis.
- The hands, sir?
We never so much as touched hands.
Oh, dear.
I have made a fool of myself.
Sarah has that effect.
Mr. Savage should have introduced us.
Oh, no, sir.
It was up to me.
Well, it's not serious.
If you look at it from the outside, it's quite funny.
But I'm on the inside, sir.
It's not Mr. Savage
I mind about so much.
It's my boy, sir.
And when I tell him that you're the husband-- yeah, but you're wrong.
I'm acting on the husband's behalf.
So you've requested an investigation of yourself?
It's an interesting paradox.
But who's the wrong party then, sir, if you'll forgive-- pardon me, sir.
I am slow in such matters.
Both you and the husband have been supplanted in that lady's affections by-- another?
Try to think of it the way I do, Mr. Parkis.
Jealousy can only exist with desire.
You are on a hunt for desire.
Just regard yourself as its servant.
Of course, sir.
That's my job.
Thank you.
The vicarious lover, Parkis.
Good night, sir.

You're killing me with love.
So, he's got the scent too,

What scent?
The scent of love.
Stalking it like a retriever.
Well, he's remarkably persistent, sir.
He observed the party in question, then in a state of partial undress, with an unidentified male.
Where?
In the bedroom, sir.
The male party then closed the door, and my boy made his exit.
The implication, and I think you would agree, is that... intimacy was, uh, imminent.
Indeed. Who is he?
Well, now, here, sir, is where our progress was definitely made.
As my boy left, he glanced at the appointment book in the front hallway.
Now, the party in question had a dental appointment at 3:30 the following day.
And, in fact, she visited at 3:30 a premises on 65 cedar road...
Where no dentist's sign was in evidence.

Why, the fictitious dental appointment, sir.
Exhibit "B."
My boy took that.
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
And the party in question emerged two hours later.
Passage of time being amply sufficient for, um, intimacy to have taken place.
The courts generally demand at least an hour, sir.
Now, my boy would have provided us with photos of her reemergence, but for the, uh, unfortunate occurrence of him fallin' asleep.
Luckily, sir, the, uh, party in question...
Mistook him for an abandoned urchin, are you lost?
Woke him up and led him to the nearest tube station.
So the time of reemergence is definitely established, as was an acquaintance, which may have its uses in the future, for all we know, sir.
So, should I walk in and confront him like the injured husband?
I'm against it, sir.
It complicates things in the courts.
This will never reach court.
An amicable settlement then.
There's lack of interest.
One can hardly make a fuss about a man called Smythe.

[ Parkis ] highly successful,
I would say, sir.
But Mrs. Miles looked a bit out of sorts.
I refer to this as exhibit "B."
Did you look at it?
I ascertained its nature, sir.
And, from one entry, judged she wasn't the cautious type.
[ Sarah's voice ] so happy.
"M" returns today.
My experience of diaries is that they always give things away, sir.
People invent their little codes. You soon see through them, sir.
[ Sarah's voice ]
I woke up, and the sun was shining.
This covers several years.
[ Parkis ]
I hope you're satisfied, sir.
[ Sarah's voice ] life was going to be happy again, but last night I dreamt--
I think this may well close our account, Parkis.
Yeah, I had a feeling it might, sir.
I have enjoyed our association, sir, if one can talk of enjoying under the sad circumstances.
As have I.
So I hope you wouldn't resent a memento, sir.
There's quite a history with that. You remember the Bolton case?
Uh, I can't say I do.
Caused quite a stir at the time, sir.
Lady Bolton, her maid and the man, all discovered together.
That ashtray stood beside the bed, sir.
On the lady's side.
I shall treasure it, Parkis.
If ashtrays could speak, sir.
Indeed.
Perhaps I should call later, just to make sure there were no loose ends.
Thank you, Parkis.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
[ Sarah's voice ] sometimes
I get tired of trying to convince him that I love him..
And shall love him forever.
He pounces on my words like a barrister and twists them.
[ Bendrix ] so what will you do when it ends?
You think love ends when you don't see me?
To be is to be perceived.
Do I exist for you when you're with Henry?
Yes.
Isn't that why you stay with Henry?
Because you know this will end?
No.
[ loud explosion ]
We should go to the basement.
My landlady might be there.
Does that matter?
Maybe to her.
It's close, Maurice.
I'll go and check.
Let me go with you.
I'll be one second.
Hello?
There's nobody there.
It's clear.
Maurice!
Maurice!
[ Coughing ]
Maurice!
Oh, god!
Oh, god.
Oh, god.
Oh, god, don't take him.
[ Sarah's voice ] but you had.
Maurice.
Maurice.
Whatever was him was gone.
You'd taken it.
Maurice.
Maurice.
I've never believed in prayer.
God, please bring him back.
Let him live.
I don't believe in you, but please, let him live.
Dear god, please...
Let him--
Maurice.
Maurice!
Maurice!
[ Sobbing ] dear god, please let him live.
Please bring him back.
Please don't take him.
I'll give him up forever.
Only please, let him be alive.
Let him live, and I promise...
I'll never see him again.
Sarah?
Oh, my god.
You're alive?
[ Bendrix ] you sound disappointed.
[ Sarah's voice ] but if he was alive, now I was dead.
Sarah.
What were you doing on the floor?
Praying.
To what? to anything that might exist.
[ Sarah narrating ] how could I explain to him...
What made no sense to me?
You didn't move.
I knew for certain you were dead.
There wasn't much to pray for then, was there? a miracle.
And we don't believe in that.
[ Air raid siren wailing ]
And that siren means you go.
Yes.
[ Sarah's voice ] and I knew that nothing in this world...
Would make sense to me again.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Sarah.
Love doesn't end...
Just because we don't see each other.
Doesn't it? people go on loving god, don't they, all their lives...
Without seeing him?
That's not my kind of love.
Maybe there's no other kind.
[ Men chattering ]
[ Sarah narrating ]
I can't be held to that promise.
But something told me
I would be.
I had tempted fate, and fate had accepted.
So I was in the desert now, a desert without him.
I started a tour with Henry-- civil defense in Southern England--
Henry and I sleeping side by side like figures on tombs.
In the new reinforced shelter at Bigwell-on-Sea, the chief warden kissed me.
I allowed him to, but felt nothing.
I'm beginning to believe in you, god.
And maybe that's how you work.
You empty me of love, then fill that emptiness.
[ Henry ] they're recommending me for an O.B.E.
[ Sarah ] what's that?
Step below a C.B.E.
When I retire,
I'll probably be a K.B.E.
It's confusing.
Couldn't they stick to the same letters?
Would you like to be lady miles?
[ Man narrating newsreel ] this was the British people's finest day--
V.E. day-- the end of the German war.
A man we seem to have seen before somewhere...
Looks down from a balcony in Whitehall.
[ Cheering ]
[ Sarah narrating ] the whole of London seemed happy because there was peace.
And there were no more bombs.
But I'm not sure
I like the peace.
I walked his walks, tried to think where he'd be.
Then I gave up.
I thought that now the world is at peace, maybe I should have some.
I told him it all.
And whoever heard my promise must have heard it too...
And must have known it already, since god knows everything.
How cruel that knowledge seemed.
It knew what I would say before I made that promise.
Knew it would keep me to it.
Knew me the way his hands knew me.
[ Henry ]
Sarah, darling.
Henry.
You. knew I would meet him on the stairs.
Been out for a walk?
Yes.
It's a filthy night.
You're wet through,
Sarah.
One day you'll catch your death of cold.
Good night.
Knew he would hate me.
Wednesday.
[ Bendrix ] Wednesday? let me check.
Uh, would Thursday do?
Thursday, then.
The park Lane hotel at 1:00?
I took my time.
I didn't want to be early.
Why did you want to meet?
[ Sarah narrating ]
I wanted to tell you I've been dead for the past two years.
I can't be without you any longer.
I think he's lonely.
But of course, I didn't.
He's never really noticed me.
Not for years.
Maybe you've given him reason.
What reason could I give?
What reason did you give me?
None.
Are you on a new book?
Of course.
It's not about us, is it? the one you threatened to write?
A book takes a year to write.
It's too hard work for revenge.
If you knew how little you have to revenge--
I'm joking.
We had a good time together.
I mean, we're adults...
And we knew it had to end sometime.
And now we can lunch and talk about Henry.
[ Sarah narrating ] in the old days, he would have followed.
We would've made up.
Or made love.
I said to god, as I might've said to my father,
"dear god, I'm tired.
"I'm tired of being without him.
And it's all because of you."
Dr. Gilbert's appointment.
I'd almost forgotten.
He asked me how I felt.
I said I felt nothing.
There was a stone where my heart should be.
I need help, father.
Sarah, god granted us free will.
Good. So it's settled.
I'm leaving my husband.
You can't.
Why can't I?
I'm a whore and a liar.
I'm asking Henry for a divorce.
You can't...
Because you're good.
Better than any person I know.
You're wrong, father.
And you don't know me.
[ Sarah narrating ]
I found a small boy sleeping on the steps...
With a birthmark covering his face...
And wondered what kind of god would give a child that.
Are you lost?
It's all right.
It's all right.
Where do you live, then?
You'll be all right, now? yes, ma'am.
I kissed his cheek and wished
I could wash it away.
And suddenly I felt happy again.
I could free myself of this.
I...
Am leaving you.
For the last...
Five years,
I have been...
In love...
With Maurice.
[ Henry ]
I love you.
Do you know that?
Why now, Henry?
Why do you say that now?
I had a drink with Bendrix.
A horrible drink.
[ Whispering ]
I can't do without you.
Oh, yes, you can, I thought.
You changed your newspaper once, and you soon got used to it.
What's wrong, Henry?
Did Bendrix upset you in some way?
I know I haven't been much of a husband to you, my dear.
We are good friends.
You can do without a friend.
Don't leave me, Sarah.
Stick it out a few more years.
I'll try.
I promise.
Is this coincidence, I wondered, or the way life happens?
And if this is life, am I stuck with it?
But whatever it is,
I can't fight it anymore.
It has won...
And we have lost.
[ Phone ringing ]
[ Ringing continues ]
Hello?
[ Bendrix ]
Sarah.
She's not here.
I know your voice, Sarah.
Talk to me.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah.
Sarah!
[ Sobbing ]
Stop here.
- Thank you.
- [ Man ]
Thank you very much, gov.
One, please.
Ticket, sir.
Sarah.
How did you get it?
[ Sighs ] you had a drinks party last week.
Yes.
That small man.
Yes.
He is my snoop.
Oh, Maurice.
How ridiculous.
It's no more ridiculous than you.
Why didn't you tell me?
I tried.
Each time I tried, something would happen.
That's mumbo-jumbo,
Sarah.
No, it doesn't work like that.
Accidents.
Little things.
God is in the details, Maurice.
You can't believe that.
Do you believe in things you can't see?
You mean him?
I mean you.
You see,
I never stopped loving you, even though I couldn't see you.
My mother baptized me a catholic.
My father was Jewish, so we never practiced.
But she always said she hoped it would "take."
Like a vaccination.
I've only made two promises in my life.
One was to marry Henry, the other to stop seeing you.
And I'm too weak to keep either.
I know you don't believe in him, but try to.
Talk to him.
I can't.
Tell him I'm sorry.
I'm too human, too weak.
Tell him
I can't keep my promises.
I'm tired of being without you.
Let's get you home.
[ Sobbing ]
I don't want to go home.
I know.
So have we broken the spell?
The world didn't end, did it?
It did, in a way.
But then it always did.
Can I sleep now, Maurice?
Please let me sleep.
[ Doorbell ringing ]
It's Henry.
Don't answer it.
Why not? We'll have to tell him sometime.
Come away with me.
Where?
Anywhere.
Brighton.
I want a few days' peace before the arguments begin.
Henry never argues.
I wasn't talking about Henry.
[ Man chattering ]
[ Bendrix narrating ] pain is easy to write.
In pain, we're all drably individual.
But what can one write about happiness?
[ Screaming ] whoo!
[ Both laughing, shouting ]
It doesn't suit you, and it's mine! you want it?
There's a price.
How much?
Can I pay again?
I want children, you know.
How many?
We'll start with one.
Only one?
You want to start with two?
Is that a promise?
Yes.
[ Coughing ]
Let's get you back to the hotel.
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
[ Chattering ]
Still on the job, Parkis? don't worry. Don't worry.
[ Gasps ] Oh, dear.
Come with me.
Come.
So where's your boy this time?
I left him at home, sir.
Hardly a wise move.
He'd have had the sense not to get noticed.
You think so, sir? perhaps I wasn't cut out for this job.
Tell your employer the circumstances are unique.
That-- what was your phrase? the party in question is a writer.
They notice everything.
They certainly seem to, sir.
So who's hired you this time?
I'm not at Liberty to say.
Let me guess:
The jealous husband.
I never expected to be recalled to this case, sir.
Yours is a secure profession, Parkis.
As long as fools like us love, your employment never ends.
You could put it like that.
And love never ends, does it?
It seems not, sir.
What do you need,
Parkis?
Photographs of us in flagrante delicto?
Copies of hotel bills? evidence of soiled sheets? we'd be happy to oblige.
No. My brief is to follow you.
Inform him as to your whereabouts.
Which, of course, you'll do.
I'm obliged to, sir, under the terms of my employment, posthaste.
But won't you need supplementary evidence? divorce courts will demand it.
They generally do, sir, if it come to that.
Well, exhibit "a."
Um, receipt for two sandwiches bought on the train to Brighton.
Mutual sandwiches are surely evidence of intimacy, aren't they?
They could be so construed, sir.
Exhibit "b" -- two tickets for a big Dipper.
[ Sighs ] you seem to be doing my job for me, sir.
But we haven't got there.
I mean, what would clinch it for us, Parkis?
What would make divorce a certainty?
Generally, sir, some kind of photographic evidence of, um-- of intimacy.
W-would be most useful, sir, if it came to such a pass.
It will, Parkis.
It most certainly will.
Sarah.
[ Coughing ]
I dreamt we had a child.
We will.
We were on the bed together.
The room filled up with water.
There was a child between us.
Why water?
The sea had come in the window.
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
So, you'll marry me.
That's a promise.
The prince regent began building it for his mistress,
Mrs. Fitzherbert.
Beautiful but flawed.
How was she flawed?
She was catholic.
Impossible, of course.
So he loved her?
Yes, but he married
Princess Caroline of Brunswick, who was protestant.
But huge. And he built this huge folly to impossibility.
Not now, Henry.
Forgive me, Sarah.
I had to.
- Oh, god.
Please, Henry. Not now.
- You had to what, Henry?
Talk.
Go back home, Henry.
You can't hold on to her forever.
I know, but-- it hardly suits you,
Henry-- the role of a jealous husband.
Please, Bendrix.
I don't mean to make a scene.
Go home.
I'm not jealous, Bendrix.
What was it you said?
Lovers are jealous.
Husbands are ridiculous.
I was never her lover.
Not much of a husband either,
I'm afraid.
But you hired our detective.
I had to find out where she was.
So you know.
She wants a divorce.
That won't be possible, old man.
You'll contest it?
No.
But it would take at least three months.
What's three months, Henry, out of a lifetime?
Half.
Half of what?
Of a lifetime, I'm afraid.
Sarah's dying, Bendrix.
Her doctor called the night she didn't come back...
With the result of some tests.
I knocked on your door.
I imagined you were both there.
H-how oddly we behave at such moments.
You shouldn't get wet, darling.
Don't you like the rain, Henry?
Yes, dear, but-- you've had news, Henry.
Is it good?
No, dear.
You see, Maurice?
Never make a promise.
You may have to keep it.
You should never have been jealous of me, Bendrix.
I did Sarah a great disservice when I married her.
I realize that now.
I'm not the sort that makes a lover.
She wanted someone like you.
I'm not sure it's as simple as that.
If you don't mind me asking,
I'd like you there when the time comes.
It may not come, Henry.
You of all people don't believe in miracles, Bendrix.
No, but Sarah does.
See, I always believed that I'd be the one to die first, and that Sarah would know what to do.
Are you at a loss, Henry?
I am, quite.
And it would save you a bit...
If you moved in with us.
Sarah always said your books weren't as successful as they should have been.
You could be there, working in the daytime while I'm at the ministry.
And at night, we could both--
[ Bendrix narrating ] and so I moved to the north side of the common.
[ Doorbell rings ] and oddly enough,
I felt instantly at home.
[ Ring ]
Oh.
Can I help you, father?
I've come about Mrs. Miles.
She's indisposed.
You mean she's ill, don't you?
Yes, I suppose I do.
Yes.
She's been to see me several times.
And I know she would like to see me before-- she left word with me she is not to be disturbed.
Is her husband here?
No.
She told me about you.
I know she did.
I'm the lover, father.
Who was that?
The postman.
What did he bring?
He had the wrong address.
How odd for a postman.
You know what happened that day?
You thought I was dead, and I wasn't.
No, darling.
Something happened in that room.
There were the same walls around me, the same sunlight coming in the window.
But nothing would ever be the same again.
You can't believe this, Sarah.
[ Whispering ] but it's true.
I never loved anyone as I loved you.
Then when you came through that door with blood on your face, another kind of love came with you.
And I caught belief...
Like a disease.
[ Whispering ]
I fell into belief like I'd...
Fallen into love.
And I tried to fight it, but I haven't any fight left.
It wasn't the postman, was it?
No, it wasn't.
Dear Maurice, you can't go on fighting.
It's only love, after all.
[ Bendrix narrating ] so, you're taking her.
But you haven't got me yet.
I don't want your peace and your love.
I wanted Sarah for a lifetime.
And you're taking her from me.
So I hate you, god.
I hate you as though you existed.
[ Henry ]
Bendrix!
You have to help me,
Bendrix. I can't.
I will.
I can't live in a world where she's gone.
I'll help you.
I would have taken care of all the arrangements if I'd known.
Surely you disapprove of cremation.
I would've arranged a catholic burial.
But she wasn't a catholic, was she, Henry?
We recognize the baptism of desire.
She said things that seemed like prayers.
We've made all the arrangements.
We can't alter things now, you wouldn't want talk, Henry.
There's the notice in the times.
No, no.
If you'd come a little sooner, father.
Please don't think--
I think nothing bad of you, Mr. Miles.
Perhaps me.
Don't worry,
Mr. Bendrix.
Nothing you can do will affect her now.
She was a good woman.
She was nothing of the sort. Bendrix!
She could put the blinkers on any man. She deceived you, father, her husband and me.
She was a consummate liar.
[ Henry ]
You've no right.
[ Father ] let the poor man rave.
Don't give me professional pity!
- Keep it for your confessional.
- You can find me there
I don't want you, father.
I'm no Sarah.
[ Henry ] Sorry, father.
No need to be. You see,
I know when a man is in pain.
I'm not in pain, father.
I'm in hate.
I hate Sarah because she was a tart to your mumbo-jumbo.
I hate Henry because she stuck to him.
And I hate you and your imaginary god because you took her away from all of us.
[ Scoffs ] you are a good hater.
To hell with all of you!
I'm sorry, Henry.
The thing is, Bendrix,
I always knew.
I knew she was with someone.
But I never thought you.
The odd thing is,
I'm glad it was.
It's a sad pleasure to see you here, sir, where bygones are always bygones.
Do you always follow your people as far as this?
She was a very fine lady, sir.
At the cocktail party, she handed me a glass of Sherry.
Was it south African Sherry?
I wouldn't know, sir.
There weren't many like her.
My boy, now, he's always speaking of her.
How is your boy, Parkis?
He's exceptionally well, sir, but he's a bit upset today.
He imagined she'd be buried in a catholic way.
And why would he think that?
Young boys, sir, they get these ideas.
Though I have to admit, even I can't explain it.
Explain what?
On the day of her assignation, she walked him to a tube.
She thought he was lost, gave him a coin, and kissed him on his cheek.
On his affected cheek, sir.
And over the weeks that followed, his affliction gradually went away.
I tried to keep him rational, but he swears it was because of her.
Say hello to Mr. Bendrix, Lance.
Hello, sir.
[ Bendrix narrating ]
I wrote at the start that this was a diary of hate.
I hated you as though you existed.
Now I'm tired of hating, but you're still here.
So your cunning is infinite.
You used my hate to win my acknowledgement.
Thank you, Henry.
And I've only one prayer left.
Dear god, forget about me.
Look after her and Henry.
