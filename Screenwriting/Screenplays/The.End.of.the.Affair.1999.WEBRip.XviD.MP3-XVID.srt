[ Camera shutter clicks ]

1018
01:22:23,239 --> 01:22:26,009
So, you'll marry me.

1019
01:22:29,212 --> 01:22:30,980
That's a promise.

1020
01:23:02,178 --> 01:23:05,614
The prince regent began
building it for his mistress,
Mrs. Fitzherbert.

1021
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:08,151
Beautiful but flawed.

1022
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:10,719
How was she flawed?
She was catholic.

1023
01:23:10,753 --> 01:23:13,222
Impossible, of course.

1024
01:23:13,256 --> 01:23:15,424
So he loved her?

1025
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:17,593
Yes, but he married
Princess Caroline
of Brunswick,

1026
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:20,463
who was protestant.

1027
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:26,469
But huge. And he built
this huge folly
to impossibility.

1028
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:29,305
Not now, Henry.
Forgive me, Sarah.
I had to.

1029
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:32,608
- Oh, god.
Please, Henry. Not now.
- You had to what, Henry?

1030
01:23:34,677 --> 01:23:37,313
Talk.
Go back home, Henry.

1031
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,515
You can't hold on
to her forever.
I know, but--

1032
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:41,517
it hardly suits you,
Henry--

1033
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:43,619
the role of a jealous husband.

1034
01:23:43,652 --> 01:23:47,090
Please, Bendrix.
I don't mean
to make a scene.

1035
01:23:47,123 --> 01:23:49,158
Go home.

1036
01:23:49,192 --> 01:23:51,194
I'm not jealous, Bendrix.

1037
01:23:52,495 --> 01:23:54,463
What was it you said?

1038
01:23:54,497 --> 01:23:56,499
Lovers are jealous.

1039
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,567
Husbands are ridiculous.

1040
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:03,306
I was never her lover.

1041
01:24:03,339 --> 01:24:05,574
Not much
of a husband either,
I'm afraid.

1042
01:24:05,608 --> 01:24:07,676
But you hired our detective.

1043
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:10,213
I had to find out where she was.

1044
01:24:10,246 --> 01:24:13,182
So you know.
She wants a divorce.

1045
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:18,154
That won't be possible, old man.

1046
01:24:18,187 --> 01:24:20,856
You'll contest it?
No.

1047
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:24,427
But it would take
at least three months.
What's three months, Henry,

1048
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,595
out of a lifetime?

1049
01:24:27,863 --> 01:24:30,333
Half.

1050
01:24:30,366 --> 01:24:32,668
Half of what?

1051
01:24:32,701 --> 01:24:35,271
Of a lifetime, I'm afraid.

1052
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:40,443
Sarah's dying, Bendrix.

1053
01:24:40,476 --> 01:24:42,811
Her doctor called the night
she didn't come back...

1054
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:46,715
With the result of some tests.

1055
01:24:48,451 --> 01:24:50,519
I knocked on your door.

1056
01:24:52,355 --> 01:24:54,390
I imagined you were both there.

1057
01:24:57,893 --> 01:25:00,729
H-how oddly we behave
at such moments.

1058
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:18,314
You shouldn't get wet, darling.

1059
01:25:18,347 --> 01:25:21,317
Don't you like the rain, Henry?

1060
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:23,319
Yes, dear, but--

1061
01:25:23,352 --> 01:25:24,853
you've had news, Henry.

1062
01:25:24,887 --> 01:25:26,855
Is it good?

1063
01:25:26,889 --> 01:25:29,558
No, dear.

1064
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:33,662
You see, Maurice?
Never make a promise.

1065
01:25:33,696 --> 01:25:35,698
You may have to keep it.

1066
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:46,375
You should never have been
jealous of me, Bendrix.

1067
01:25:52,715 --> 01:25:55,751
I did Sarah
a great disservice
when I married her.

1068
01:25:55,784 --> 01:25:57,620
I realize that now.

1069
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:01,557
I'm not the sort
that makes a lover.

1070
01:26:04,327 --> 01:26:06,829
She wanted someone like you.

1071
01:26:06,862 --> 01:26:09,632
I'm not sure
it's as simple as that.

1072
01:26:14,337 --> 01:26:16,171
If you don't mind me asking,

1073
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:20,943
I'd like you there
when the time comes.

1074
01:26:20,976 --> 01:26:24,880
It may not come, Henry.

1075
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:27,683
You of all
people don't believe
in miracles, Bendrix.

1076
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:30,286
No, but Sarah does.

1077
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:37,760
See, I always believed
that I'd be the one
to die first,

1078
01:26:39,628 --> 01:26:41,797
and that Sarah would
know what to do.

1079
01:26:45,634 --> 01:26:47,803
Are you at a loss, Henry?

1080
01:26:51,607 --> 01:26:53,542
I am, quite.

1081
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:58,514
And it would save you a bit...

1082
01:26:58,547 --> 01:27:01,284
If you moved in with us.

1083
01:27:01,317 --> 01:27:04,787
Sarah always said your books
weren't as successful
as they should have been.

1084
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:11,427
You could be there,

1085
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:14,797
working in the daytime
while I'm at the ministry.

1086
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:17,600
And at night,

1087
01:27:17,633 --> 01:27:19,568
we could both--

1088
01:27:26,609 --> 01:27:30,279
[ Bendrix narrating ]
and so I moved to the north
side of the common.

1089
01:27:30,313 --> 01:27:33,682

and oddly enough,
I felt instantly at home.

Can I help you, father?

1093
01:27:47,363 --> 01:27:48,597
I've come about Mrs. Miles.

1094
01:27:48,631 --> 01:27:50,032
She's indisposed.

1095
01:27:50,065 --> 01:27:52,968
You mean she's ill, don't you?

1096
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:57,340
Yes, I suppose I do.
Yes.

1097
01:27:57,373 --> 01:27:59,942
She's been to see me
several times.

1098
01:27:59,975 --> 01:28:02,511
And I know she would
like to see me before--

1099
01:28:02,545 --> 01:28:04,780
she left word with me
she is not to be disturbed.

1100

Is her husband here?

1101

No.

1102
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:16,525
She told me about you.

1103
01:28:16,559 --> 01:28:17,826
I know she did.

Who was that?

1106

The postman.

1107
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,727
What did he bring?

1108
01:28:54,129 --> 01:28:55,831
He had the wrong address.

1109
01:29:00,803 --> 01:29:02,838
How odd for a postman.

Something happened in that room.

1115

There were the same

I never loved anyone
as I loved you.

01:30:01,964 --> 01:30:04,900
Then when you came
through that door
with blood on your face,

1122
01:30:08,103 --> 01:30:11,740
another kind of love
came with you.

1123
01:30:11,774 --> 01:30:14,777
And I caught belief...

1124
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:17,813
Like a disease.

1125
01:30:17,846 --> 01:30:20,015

but I haven't any fight left.

You have to help me,

Was it south African Sherry?

1185
01:36:12,134 --> 01:36:14,169
I wouldn't know, sir.

1186
01:36:14,202 --> 01:36:16,905
There weren't many like her.

1187
01:36:16,939 --> 01:36:19,374
My boy, now,
he's always speaking of her.

1188
01:36:19,407 --> 01:36:22,544
How is your boy, Parkis?

1189
01:36:22,577 --> 01:36:27,015
He's exceptionally well, sir,
but he's a bit upset today.

1190
01:36:27,049 --> 01:36:29,551
He imagined she'd be buried
in a catholic way.

1191
01:36:29,584 --> 01:36:31,987
And why would he think that?

1192
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:34,589
Young boys, sir,
they get these ideas.

1193
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:38,193
Though I have to admit,
even I can't explain it.

1194
01:36:38,226 --> 01:36:41,129
Explain what?

1195
01:36:41,163 --> 01:36:43,565
On the day of her assignation,

1196
01:36:43,598 --> 01:36:46,134
she walked him to a tube.

1197
01:36:46,168 --> 01:36:50,172
She thought he was lost,
gave him a coin, and
kissed him on his cheek.

1198
01:36:50,205 --> 01:36:52,841
On his affected cheek, sir.

1199
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:54,843
And over the weeks
that followed,

1200
01:36:54,877 --> 01:36:57,179
his affliction
gradually went away.

1201
01:36:57,212 --> 01:37:00,015
I tried to keep him
rational, but he swears
it was because of her.

1202
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:04,887
Say hello
to Mr. Bendrix, Lance.

1203
01:37:23,271 --> 01:37:25,207
Hello, sir.

1204
01:37:37,385 --> 01:37:41,123
[ Bendrix narrating ]
I wrote at the start
that this was a diary of hate.

1205
01:37:41,156 --> 01:37:44,259
I hated you
as though you existed.

1206
01:37:44,292 --> 01:37:47,162
Now I'm tired of hating,

1207
01:37:47,195 --> 01:37:49,531
but you're still here.

1208
01:37:49,564 --> 01:37:53,902
So your cunning is infinite.

1209
01:37:53,936 --> 01:37:58,106
You used my hate to win
my acknowledgement.
Thank you, Henry.

1210
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:00,508
And I've only one prayer left.

1211
01:38:02,177 --> 01:38:06,014
Dear god, forget about me.

1212
01:38:06,048 --> 01:38:09,417
