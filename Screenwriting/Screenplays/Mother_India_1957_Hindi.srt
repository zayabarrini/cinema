I am telling the truth.
The bride was so beautiful that everyone was talking about her.
Why not define?
Do I have ten children?
God gave me this one son.
Uncle's wife, there is no one in the village who does not talk about the beauty of your daughter-in-law.
What's the point of her beauty?
I must know how to work.
If God wants, he will learn everything
I heard something... the people of the village say that why are you silent tell me what they say.
Tell me, don't be upset, my uncle's wife.
People say that you mortgaged your land for the wedding what Did I mortgage my land?
They dare to speak in front of me so that I will bite their teeth.
What did God give me?
I don't have land.
I don't have a house...I don't have a cow
I have everything, then they say that my uncle's wife has mortgaged his blood.
Why are you villagers so jealous?
Go get lost.
Yes, I pledged the land.
If I didn't pledge, how could I get you married?
Who doesn't do this?
If the bride is well-behaved, we will return the land.
It is said that it brings blessings.
Let me do something
OK you do it.
What did you do? Did you just take off your wedding and jewellery?
If you are not thinking about yourself, think about me
I haven't seen you properly yet.
Come put this on your neck - sell this
- Why should I sell?
- Your burden will be a little lighter what time.
Mother mortgaged her land.
This is a lie, the people of the village are spreading this word.
Even if it is left, nothing will happen. I will pay 7 money for the land very soon.
Mom can see my hand now, let it go.
So what can he see?-
Aren't you ashamed?
Put shame in this basket.
Oh God, let mom come now - let her come
I swear to myself, these are very beautiful in your hands.
I ask God that these are always in my hand so that you can look at them.
Why not when I'm always here.
So I bring them every day until you put them in my hand - of course
Ah shameless boy.
Did you think you were the only man in this village who got married?
If someone sees you, they will punch you in the face.
The same woman you have never seen before.
What should I tell you, bride?
Why should I blame you?
His father was the same.
Look here, light the fire what are you cooking your own head.
Don't throw pepper on the bride's ground.
Listen, bride.
Don't let him get too close to you stop it.
This way the value goes up.
Ah, lady Kamla, walk carefully and don't slip on your feet for a while.
Oh, Lala, this is a woman's leg, not a man's - let's go
The bride was upset,
I said it for your sake.
The jars may break.
As long as you are alive in the village, no one can put a copper jar on your head
I want you to put gold on your head.
But no one listens to me, it's bad.
Let's go, come on.
Go wash your mouth, the bad smell will come here.
- Why are you messing with him? Who is it?
- The village grocer
But too bad, I'll see you for lunch.
Dinner finally came.
But Radha, you took too long to come.
Well, come and sit down.
Radha, I think you should come with me tomorrow morning.
- What's the food?
- Don't think about the food
You are the only food I need.
God, how delicious.
Radha, eating from your hand is very tasty - there is not much salt in it
Again, even if the saltiness of words is low, speak sweet words.
You just need to touch the food.
The salt can be measured, but your hands are very salty where is the salt Let me see-where is it?
All the salt in the village is in your hands.
I swear by the
Ganges to see your hands.
Did your henna colour go away in two days?
- So what should I do?
- Nothing! Why don't you understand Radha
A newly wed should not work so much, I get upset like this bride?
We have been married for two days now.
He somehow says that he should not touch anything for at least two months for two years.
He won't have the chance later, let the other brides of the village be jealous.
Keep a distance, someone might see.
No one's looking - shut up
Don't let it go - Radha, this is a big problem
You are afraid of my mother at home, do you want to steal from others outside?
How long have we been afraid of our children, is this true, Radha?
Are you counting on my children from now on? the day that God wills?
He definitely wants it.
Look, Radha, I can't work on 4 fields alone.
I want at least four boys to work on the ground with me.
Every boy on a floor shampoo out of your hand.

"My heart dances with happiness" what has happened?
Where do you have the feather boy.
Shameless.
I am very happy to give you wheat today.
Come get it too, I'm very happy.
Let me give you wheat what are you doing?
Come get it too calm down boy calm down.
You are not the only one who got a boy, calm down a bit.
How do you know how good it is to have a boy?
Let me give you wheat - you are crazy
Uncle's wife, come here soon.
You call people like a broken drum.
Congratulate me first - your uncle's wife is worried about congratulating you
Your son is also making me unlucky, he is wasting all the wheat.
If he wants to do this, he should pay for it.
You should not give from my share.
Three-fourths of it is ours.
Uncle, you forget everything.
Three quarters of it is mine - is it yours?
Three quarters of it belongs to me or you?- Me
Are you all lying, do you want to steal from me?
Unknowingly, you put my fingerprints on every page.
What's wrong, mom?
Think carefully and make a decision.
Whenever you asked for help, I helped you, now make your decision.
Until the debt of 500 rupees is fully settled
I will pay you three quarters of my product as profit did you hear.
This is his fingerprint.
Uncle's wife, now if you can tell me, this is not your fingerprint.
Only God knows what you wrote in that paper.
Speak with your tongue,
I understand your tongue.
You didn't tell me that three shares are yours and one share is mine?
My uncle saw the white hair of his wife and I gave her money without any question
I gave him 500 rupees, money that I did not touch even once.
Now, if you beat me, I will go to court.
Who do you fear from the court?
The court is not blind, it will send you to prison.
Did you hear what he said?
He wants to send me to prison.
If the police don't come and take all the land from you, my moustache has no value.
The police never come to our village.
We make our own decisions here.
What are you saying, uncle?-
The police shouldn't come here
So decide soon.
What do you think?
When they have written a document, they must act according to it.
Uncle, do something, tell him to finger you too.
Otherwise, there is no trust in this old woman, she is alive now, she will die tomorrow.
May you and your family die
I will die after your death ceremony.
You scared the council and a decision was made in your favour.
You have wronged my children, may God cut you to pieces.
As long as I live, Shamo will not put his finger on any paper, let's go to Shamo.

Don't give it to him - why?
He didn't make a beam for me -
I will make it, why are you upset?
What's up here?
Whose property did you think that you are desecrating?
Pour it there - it won't pour
Take this look from the boy's hand.
Jon's son, this is my share.
You did not work on the ground.
My son, I spent five hundred rupees for your birth come here - what? you stole.
Did I steal?- Yes yes you stole-go back
If I get angry, you will feel bad.
Go ahead of them.
There is no problem, let them do their work.
My umbrella costs 5 rupees.
Remember, I will add these five rupees to your debt.
This kid ruined my umbrella.
My umbrella... my umbrella-give me the umbrella give it back.
Do you throw it away?
I added those 5 rupees to your debt.
Remember dinner.
Your son messed up that man today.
Grandma is lying
I wanted to hit my shoulder - why?
He told me to steal sugar - I didn't say he stole it himself liar - take a seat
This is evil.
Grandma, don't tell me the devil or I will hit you.
Mom, I will eat with you too - I will eat too, mom.
Come here soon.
Hi hi
Did you bring the little devil?
You did a good job all say.
A person who studies becomes a good hearted person.
Who said such a thing?
Am I happy now?- Yes, Mr. Abed
Teach him well, otherwise he will teach you.
Don't worry at all
I saw a lot of mischief at this age.
You just teach him.
When he grows up, he will know everything
English people don't know everything either.
- But I'm learning.
- You go and sit
Otherwise, I will punish you - Mr. Abed
Please don't punish me - no sister
He does not learn without being punished.
I myself was punished more than a hundred times before I learned a lesson.
Yes, Radha.
Punishment is very important.
Good thing we didn't study, otherwise he would have punished us too look at it.
Get up, why are you doula?
What are you doing? Go sit down.
I know everything - what do you know?
Go sit down.
Why did you punish my brother?
He comes behind his brother to see you bend down.
Sit down, let me see.
Drop your slingshot.
You are punishing me brother, I will not give up.
You have to stay here until morning.
What are you eating?
What is your name?
My name is Tijo.
Go to the card of this boy's name.
Is the boy's name? So tell the truth?
My name is Pupa. Rs...
What kind of behaviour is this?
Do they just taste it?
Ardenkhodchi took my daughter from her, this thief, thief give him-come
Come, I want to talk to you, first give him chickpea flour come and get it.
Come on say what you want to say.
How many months are left until the harvest?
Give us some wheat, we have nothing to eat at home.
Your uncle's wife is only looking for an opportunity to eat me.
I can no longer lend to you.
There is no news of returning the things I have given you so far.
Don't you take three quarters of our harvest?
That profit is the original money that is still in his head.
Should our children die of hunger?
OK, Dad, your children won't starve. Let me see what you owe.
Pledge? You do not trust me?
It's not a question of trust, uncle's wife, if you wanted one or two kilos, it wouldn't be a problem.
But you want a hundred kilos, don't be upset, but I sat here for business.
We are also going hungry. Look, I am raising this child without my mother
I have to collect some money for this.
If you don't have anything, it's your bride's jewellery.
Be careful what you say, don't mention his name - OK, I won't come
Do you have any copper or bronze dishes at home?
- Dish? Yes, I have.
- So bring them
Ramu, go and tell your mother to give Gold on Messi.
To hit him in the head and kill him.
Oh Birjo
I will not let you give this to that thief
I will not let you give this to that thief.
Mom, what do you want to cook?
What do you want to pour water?
He says that he only gives us wheat when we give him our dishes.
Give it to me, my son -
I don't want that wheat
Give it my son - I won't give it, this is my dish
If you don't bring me this tray, your father will starve.
Ramu is hungry.
Grandma is hungry.
My mom is also hungry.
Mummy... are you hungry too?
Come get it my son.
Come down and have lunch
I don't eat, you eat - it's a little late
It would not turn on.
Did you beg for wheat?-
No, why are you saying this?
Why not say I said that you should not have brought food today.
But you would be hungry - it's okay, maybe God would be ashamed who gave us life but does not give us food to eat.
Why are you saying this? Come and eat.
Oh, so you gave him our dish?
I thought we have five hectares of land.
There is no product in that sieve.
Let's plant crops in that land, the thief has no right to it.
Did you think it was easy to cultivate in that land?
Half of it is full of stones and half of it is full of weeds.
My cows die in two days.
He will kill our man before the cows die
I will start preparing that land from tomorrow.
I told you that this land is full of stones.
Are you so sad because of the death of a cow?
I will pay you one hundred rupees, Lala, who is not dead yet.
My uncle's wife, I believe that any man who does not work for another man should die.
Uncle's wife - your mother, be quiet
If you don't get out of here now, I'll kill you myself-what sin did I commit?
Is Lala a thief?
Does he wear a hat? Uncle's wife.
Let him go, or he will die let it go let it go.
Leave your dinner.
Help wants to kill me.
Good thing no one saw.
Wait for revenge, I will take everything from you.
Then you call me a broom, not a lala
I will strip you.
Oh dirty mouse, give me your hand - your father is a mouse give me your hand.
Give it back, you evil mouse - your own mouse take this.
Give it to him, I won't give it to him.
It's okay, do you see a cousin?
I will take this with me to always remember.
I am saying that you will become a murderer.
If you act like this, how do you want to live?
He who is not God is not God.
So ask your God to give you another cow.
How can I get money from him now?
You don't need to take money from him, let everyone in this house die.
Let everyone die?
You are very proud.
The food you eat is thanks to her. I will burn this food, mom.
No-go away
Let go - the children are hungry
My children are hungry - your children should not eat this food
Get a cow with these.
Is it good
OK Radha.
Well done Radha, it's almost finished.
One more bit Radha.
Uncle.
Help, someone help, uncle someone help.
It would be better if
I died - God forbid
I wish I would die - what are you talking about?
Radha, what's the point of living like this - don't say that
Under your shadow, I can endure the most burning rays of my sun.
For God's sake, don't say that.
Smoke this, dad.
Dad, smoke me hey are you killing My son, smoking is not good.
- Well done, never smoke.
- I'll never smoke, dad
Well done, good boy - come on, your father, kill it
Dad, I will give you a massage.
You smoke too, there is no problem.
Bride-Wait, Grandma, I'm here
Mom, grandma is calling you.
Mom, wait, I will help you now mom mom good good.
Why do you give cows to drink from this dirty water?
Go get a cow and take it to our own land.
- Let's give him clean water.
- No, Lala, don't do that
Why not bro?
What do you want to do with this cow?
You will have to sell it tomorrow.
Brother, my money is worthless?
Lala, you will never rest.
Do not let my little children curse you
I have no hands.
You don't have hands, but you are not ashamed of me.
Your children are dying of hunger, but your wife must work to survive.
Lala.
Shamelessly go, blacken your face and sit outside.
At least you beg for some money and live your life like a dog.
What are you looking at,
Lala Singh, let's take the cow.
I will not let you take this cow.
Put a bell around your neck did you bully me
La la sing I had forgotten.
Put this bell around his neck.
Radha.
Lala also took the cow.
You don't have hands, but you also don't have shame.
Your children are dying of hunger and your wife has to work so that you can survive.
Shamelessly go, blacken your face and sit outside and beg to live like a dog.
Mom-What's wrong?
Mom, I knew.
What did you know?
I knew, mom, I knew.
Bride.

Why did he get upset and leave?
It's okay that he left, it's me, don't cry, mom.
Can I say something, mom?
Mom, who will feed him now that dad has no hands?
That's why I'm crying - don't cry

Radha Radha.
Shame on you, you took their twenty hectares of land, their cows and dishes.
Have you come to take their bodies now?
Are you looking for that other 5 hectares of land?
Lala, you die like a dog.
There is no problem, even the dog is God's creation.
- Tell me, what do you want?
- Money
He has no money until I die -
I'm willing to take care of them all
Get lost - try to understand what I mean

If I didn't come now, you would have said that you didn't come during the harvest.
God, is this a ship?
I swear to God, I am very worried about these children.
Come, my son, eat nuts
I don't want your nuts, mom makes food, I eat.
Mom is very hungry.
Mom is very hungry.
There is nothing in the pot.
The food is ready, my son.
God, why are you oppressing these little children?
What should I do? My heart does not accept to see someone's sadness.
Come, my son, come and eat.
Throw it away, throw it away how are you a mother Radha.
Come, my son, come and eat.
Bring me that one and eat it.
Throw it away, throw it away.
Do you want your mother's beer or nuts?
Mother and son are the same.
By the morning you will come to your senses.
Radha.
Lala is a very patient person.
When your anger subsides, think about my words again.
Birju Birju my son.
Birjo.
Birjo.
Birjo.
Please look at me.
Mom is hungry.
Yes, my son, I know.
Birjo, nothing will happen to you, my son.
Mom is very hungry.
Mom is hungry.
I will bring it to you now.
Mom is very hungry.
Hello madam.
Radha has come to Lala's house welcome come in come in.
My children are hungry feed me.
Feed me, my children are hungry
I understand, I understand.
I swear to God, I will wear gold from head to toe.
Don't worry, my queen, whoever holds the hand of a man like me will be happy.
Even if Lala takes care of a dog, she wears a gold chain around his neck gold.
I swear to God, I look like the goddess of wealth.
Come on, do I look like a goddess?
Aren't you ashamed that you came to this life in the form of Radha?
Now that you have come to this life in my form, see your disgrace don't laugh don't laugh.
The goddess who carries the burden of the world.
He cannot carry the burden of a mother.
Become a mother and see how you fall when you walk two steps.
Goddess Lakshmi is not going anywhere from here-pull your hand Radha let it go - don't touch it
This gave you wealth and made me miserable and brought me to you.
I want to show him that preaching is easy.
But it is difficult to act on them.
It is easy to look at other people's lives.
But living in this world is very difficult.
So hard.
I want him to see what a lonely mother can do for her children.
How far can it sink?
Now that you can't give me power.
Take away the shame from me.
I can't sacrifice my children, I can't.
I can't sacrifice my children, I can't.
He comes back alive.
Radha, a woman cannot live without a child.
A woman's duty is motherhood.
Thank God for coming to me.
Otherwise your children will die let's go let's go.
My children will not die, Goddess Lakshmi will return my husband, my children will also forgive me.
He forgives me - yes, Radha, for sure
He will give you a husband again and give you children.
But by Lala someone help me.
Radha, don't you want to go?
All the people in the village are leaving.
No, I'm not going. Do you want to die here?
Nothing will grow here for two years.
I can't leave my blood, what if it comes back?
"Oh, you're gone."
"Ah, the one who left"
"Don't leave your blood."
"A mother is holding her hands" "She is calling you."
"This village and its surroundings belong to you."
"You left all this and where did you go?"
"Even if this land is arable"
"This land is still your mother."
"If you break a mother's heart" "You will never rest."
"Ah, the one who left"

Radha, you changed the face of the village.
To tell the truth, I have never seen or heard that so many products are harvested
I feel that this amount of product came from the sky and not from the earth.
Why worry Lala?
I left three shares for you
OK - go get it
- Yes, sir?
- Fill the cart
How are you Birjo?
Go to my son, this is my share.
First show me the account and book, then take this share.
Oh, so you want to see the accounts.
Lala, has the day come when you have to pay back?
Brothers, come, Birjo wants to see Lala's account.
My son, when dad didn't even look at the account, why do you want to look at it?
The son should check the father's account.
OK, go and show him the account.
Get up, let me see, go away ask what are you doing lala
You embarrassed of yourself?
I grew old by filling your house.
Now you took a gun at my son to get these wheats?
Ten times this product for my son.
Take your share, we don't want anything.
When did I say draw a gun?
If you want to shoot a gun, go to the army.
What do I do with a gun?
I said show him the account.
Pick up the wheat, you don't do what you came for, do you pull a gun?
What are you waiting for?
Mom, I won't let him take even a grain of wheat - Birjo
Birjo must pay his share.
Take your share - long live my son
Collect what you were staring at.
Birjo, Birjo don't do this - Mom
I will not let this product go away.
We worked like cattle on the ground.
We sweated for it, so we will be hungry again.
If this product is not going to satisfy us, I will set it on fire myself.
No, don't ask.
So tell him to show me the account.
If you want to see the account, come and see.
Come and see these.
Read it my son.
Mom, read it.
Let someone read it to you.
You read it - read it, why are you embarrassed?
Birjo doesn't understand the calculations, someone explain it to him read your uncle.
My son wants this education.
If we knew how to read, we would not have come to this day.
So you signed it without reading it?
Your grandmother stepped on this toe.
What's next?
After that? The eyes of the village girls throw stones at you.
Liver gambling.
After three years, you come today and say what is the next thing?
Where have you been?- right here
Every day I stood behind the tree and looked at you would you stand up Why?
I am not afraid of you, but I have a strange feeling.
Do I have horns on my head to be afraid?
No, you are very beautiful.
Better than all the village girls.
You read so many books... but me
I don't even know what the next letter of the alphabet is.
I'm so ashamed of you - weren't you ashamed today?
I was very embarrassed today, but I was embarrassed by Suki Lala.
I want to read everything he wrote in his notebook by tomorrow morning.
Do you want to read Suki Lala's book?
Does he want too much science?-
He doesn't want any science
No, I saw it myself
I showed it to everyone, but no one could read it.
For 20 years, we give three-fourths of our produce every year in exchange for a loan of 500 rupees.
He also took our twenty hectares of land.
He took my mother's gold bangles from her.
Chains of captivity closed around our hands.
Then he still owes it.
This is a mysterious science.
I have to read and understand how there is such an allegorical science.
Do you want to know this? OK.
These 25 hectares of your grandmother's land.
He borrowed 500 rupees for the mortgage of this land.
Your first product is worth 400 rupees, of which you gave three-fourths as profit.
And you kept a share of it for yourself, and in the second year you had a crop of four hundred rupees
300 of them will be given as profit and 100 will remain yours.
This is how you gave him so much profit in these twenty years.
Then you gave him the land as profit.
But that 500 rupees is still left.
This land is mine.
This is my mother's property, no one can take it from me.
This cycle continues for the rest of life
I stop him, now I understand what's going on.
I tell my mother, I tell all the people in the village, now look.
I will take back our land
I will take back the land of all the people in the village
I steal Suki Lala's hand.
I will not miss it today.
Please be careful not to talk about my father like that.
Go take care of your father
I want to fix it.
Do you want to fix it?
Collect this first.
Pupa didn't meet me at the door, go red card.
Is this your father's property?
Did you want to hold my hand?
Your suitor is going to return from the middle of the road.
Even if I go to jail later.
Get lost, you coward.
You need a world of people to bring back the groom's caravan so watch do not run away.
Get lost, boy.
Where did you find your uncle's wife?
Birjo, I am not a woman.
Why are you crying tomorrow, not today?
You broke ten of my jars - can I say something, brother?
- I'm not a lawyer.
- Listen to me
I got your and your brother's horoscope from Abed.
Liar - believe me, I promised to give him two kilos of wheat
Are you right?- Yes what has happened?
Birjo-What did Birjo do?
Birjo - tell me if he did anything
Why don't you say so?- Birjo
I'm ashamed - of me?
Shut up - say it again
The problem is not telling you leave me.
I give my life.
Really?
Who is it?- The thief has come, take the gun
- Who?
- I brought twenty packs of cotton
- Is it cotton or garbage?
- Come and see for yourself
When you are trading at night, who wants to see what?
Take fifty rupees and put this inside.
It is not the thief's property, it is all mine.
I want a pair of gold bangles, if you have them, we can make a deal.
If I don't go - come here, listen
Take this 4.5 grams of gold, gold bangles.
Take this 25 rupees too.
My mother gives him the gold bangles.
Are these bangles really 4.5 grams?- Yes
We don't steal in the deal, Suki Lala does that.
Come on, go away.
If there is a trick, I will shoot you in the stomach with this gun.
Okay, go until dark.
Hey, give me money - money?
Yes, I have 25 rupees - OK wait what are you doing? Leave me mom.
Where have you been?
I am very angry with you.
You did not say anything to anyone.
Where was he absent for two days?
You left without telling me, I'm so sad, I won't talk to you any more.
Why didn't you say you wanted to go?
I was here mom, I didn't go anywhere.
What does this look like?
My mother was watching God's miracle by the river and under the tree.
Did you see God's miracle?
Yes, mom is a great saint here with a long dress.
His hair was very long.
Really, mom is the kind of praying.
He was sitting on his head like this what are you doing?
It was like this - sit straight and say
He was very happy to see me.
He said, ask my son, what do you want?
I said I don't want anything.
If you want to give something, give two gold bangles to my mother.
A voice said to close your eyes my son.
Close your eyes too.
Open your eyes mom.
But why did you want a gold bracelet?
Why didn't you ask about your father?
Why didn't you ask when he was coming?
Hurry up, my son, take me to him.
Mom, the point is that.
Mom, I wanted to ask about
Dad, but when I opened my eyes.
He was neither a saint, nor a river, nor a tree you do not worry.
Whenever he comes back, I will take you to him.
After that, you can ask him anything you want about dad, okay?
Mom, see how these bracelets suit you mom bangle bangle.
See Ramu, Birjo brought me a real gold bangle taken from a saint.
Mom didn't bring this saint, she brought Birjo - what do you say?
Mr. Birjo, did you start this too?
Where are you going?
Are you starting a fight?
What's the matter tell me
Your son's mother is a thief.
Don't talk to me like that - thief
Ramu.
Did my mom steal?
Who says that I am a thief?
No... No, Birjo. is a great businessman.
He brought you a gold bangle, Radha.
Tell him sister.
She is my sister from the bottom of my heart.
Radha, I did not complain about this because of you.
Besides, I have two witnesses that your son stole my product.
He also bought a gold bracelet for you.
Either give me my share or I will destroy this house.
Go dad, go complain.
It was our product,
I took it myself.
I am not a thief, you are a thief.
You have been tricking my mother all these years.
Yes, I stole, my father stole, but my moustache is worth more than yours.
But son, when you fall into your own prison, you will find out
I go.
Don't say anything to her, Radha-wait
Don't worry, I will return your money.
Birjo is crazy, mom, give her the bangle.
Mom, don't give him the bangle.
Do you want me to steal the bracelet?
You lied to me.
I don't want to touch your bracelet, let it go.
Ramu, take this away from me - let go
Don't interfere with
Ramo - let him go
Birjo, let go, Birjo.
- Mom, don't touch it.
- Please let them go
Wait Ramu - Mom, don't come to them
Please, my son, I swear on my life, let go of my hand.
Birjo, I will share my life take this.
These are yours.
Give this to your daughter.
- These are valuable.
- They are yours
Maybe it will come in handy.

Radha, stop Birjo, otherwise it will be very bad for us tell me what happened.
Tell me why are you crying?- Let me cry our uncle's wife - wait
We were taking a bath by the river when he came and bothered us.
What has Birjo been doing?-
Sometimes he throws stones
Sometimes he also breaks our jars - he broke three of my jars
Four of mine - Five of mine
Six of mine - my uncle's wife does not break mine at all
Let him come to my house, I will break his head.
Where is my stick?- Here, mom
Break his head with this
I will really break his head today.
Does it bother the village girls?
His sister?
Listen, if you do mischief,
I will break your head too.
God, why am I stuck in this adultery?
Excuse me, ladies,
I'm going - ask come here.
What's up mom?
Do you bother girls?
Do I bother girls?
No, mom, did you go to the riverside?
The river? I am here, mom.
Who said such a thing?
I said - when did I bother you?
With the snake - Mom says
I hurt her with the snake
Mom, can anyone catch a snake?
He says I scared him with a snake.
Whether you hurt him or not, but you must have caught a snake in your hand.
Birjo, you used to hold snakes in your hands since you were a child.
Then he threw it here and there.
Why did you hang your shoes up there?
Put your foot down - no mom, paw is bothering you
I said to wear them between Birjo.
You heard this, now it's my turn
- I don't want to listen.
- You have to listen
No, I won't listen to you - I swear to my soul what you want to say? Say.
Mom, I didn't bother him.
This bothers me, huh?
Tell the truth in front of mom, did I hurt you or did you hurt me?
You hurt me, you..you... you.
We bothered you.
Did you see mom? Did you believe
I did not bother them.
Snake! Birjo put a snake on it.
Birjo come along.
Let him go, Birjo, come over.
Put it on a plate.
Get it, hurry-wait
Mom, look at what delicious food we made - Ramo see ram.
Tell him I don't want to talk to him.
I don't eat, tell him.
Mom, if I buy four wives, you won't get such delicious food.
Just eat and see.
Tell Ramu to let go of me, I will not talk to him
I don't eat either.
Let go of my hand - OK, mom,
I won't hurt any more girls
Mom, I apologize for this dish.
Mom, I'm telling the truth - that's it
You also want to take his side, I know you well.
You sneakily go to see Champa.
You say the cow is sick.
You are not ashamed to talk to him before marriage
I will send him to his village tomorrow.
This is unfair, mom, you take your anger out on me.
Yes, his uncle's mother is very smart, she takes him to the top of the tamarind tree to give him tamarind to eat.
Ramu, tell him to leave me alone, I don't want to talk to him.
Please let him go, you must be punished.
Mom will neither eat nor talk to you until you are punished become a chicken.
Mom, look, the baby has become a chicken, come eat now.
I don't eat.
Well, you don't eat, I'll eat.
Pull your hand, it's chicken, then you're hungry.
You too become a chicken.
You two are bothering me, you don't care about me at all
I don't eat any more.
Mom, if you don't eat.
We will remain chickens for the rest of our lives.
OK, sit down, I'll eat.
Birjo mom is eating come eat mom.
Ramu, tell him that my fight is not over.
Please, the fight is not over yet, my dear.
I didn't say anything to you in front of those girls.
But open your ears.
I can forgive your every mischief but I will never forgive you.
If you even bother one of the village girls
I will kill you myself.
I hate these words.
I will arrange your couple's marriage tomorrow morning.
Mom, don't go wrong
I know, go to sleep.
I did not come to drink water and syrup from Chandra
I came to take this with me, my blood.
When you come to our house, you will drink this juice and syrup.
What do you say?- I say this is what my heart desires
As you know, Chandra lost his mother and brother in the flood
I was very young when I brought you my blood. I love your son too.
But I heard that you are marrying her to your nephew.
Champa's wedding with Ramu is confirmed
I want this for Birjo.
Why? In the village of Lange
Birjo, you will not find me
A bit mischievous but due to his age.
When he gets married, he will put aside his evil.
But he has many vices.
Throwing stones by day and gambling at night.
Look, don't mention my name, but I heard that Suki Lala wants to put him in jail.
The girl also bothers him.
Talk to him a bit - Yes, you and the rest of the village people are angels
Ask me, he is naughty, but everyone else is good
I had come to talk about his marriage.
Then you say bad things to my face?
Look, Birjo, don't look at us like this, we are afraid.
I don't blame you, but answer me, when did I bother you?
No... no... who did you hurt?
I am bothering you.
Who said you are bothering me?
He told my mother that he will not let Birju and Chandra get married.
Your wedding with Chandra?
Aunt Radha went to talk to him?
Did he reject the answer?
It turned out very well, I am very happy
I hope you never marry anyone ask.
That's why no one will give you a daughter.
You are very bad.
Because of you, people's lights have opened on me because of you
I will not do anything for your marriage.
I start Ramus wedding and play with his children.
You will see him all your life and be jealous of him.
I sent my mother to propose to you with this thought that when that when I marry you, I will become a very good man.
I will not marry now.
I will not be a good person any more.
Birjo, you are already married.
You married your land in the village.
She is your bride.
Suki Lala took it from you by force don't you want to release
I will release him, I will definitely do this.
It's good that my marriage with you didn't end.
Now I don't care if I die or live.
Mom wishes to see her son's wedding, and she gets her wish by marrying Ramu.
Are you coming to Ramos wedding?

Birjo, what did I do? Don't ask.
He was harassing a girl.
Birjo, did you have a bad look at one of the village girls?
Birjo, did you have a bad look at one of the village girls?
I had warned you, Birjo.
I said I won't forgive you - Mom, listen
I told you - Mom Go Shekan
I want to kill him.
Mom, this is unfair, you think it's her fault, but this girl is not innocent either.
This half is under the background.
If you don't trust me, ask the other girls in the village.
The day I got married, Birjo wanted to make her his sister.
Ask him why he didn't accept his gift.
- Who wants a torn shawl?
- Shut up did you hear mom?- yes mom
Birjo kept telling him not to colour me.
But he kept colouring it.
He kept shaking his bangles near
Birjo.ear and made him angry.
Mom, you don't know, but this girl keeps getting on Birjo's nerves.
But I want to ask which girl did Birjo not hurt?
Birjo has not broken the water jug of any girl.
Are your girls nervous about this way?
I swear to God, I have never seen anyone in this village look at someone with a bad eye.
Lala, don't open my mouth, this is not Birjo's fault.
This is the result of your own sins that are showing up in front of you.
Take shampoo for your wife.
He talks to men.
Shut up, end this fight, you gave this poison first.
Then the whole village attacked him.
Get up, get up.
Hurry up, apologize to
Lala - yes, apologize yeah excuse me-shut up
I bite his neck.
Lala, no one can touch my mother's bracelet.
Return the bracelets.
Give it back, otherwise I will take your daughter from you with bangles.
Do you really like to wear your mother's bracelet?
Tell me to make a bangle for your mother's hand.
Lala... Lala.
Lala, what is this?
He can't stay in this village any more
I beg you not to do this.
Can you people say this can stay in the village?
No.
- Lala, I'm begging you.
- My life is in danger what are you looking at Take it and throw it outside the village.
It's too much - ask, no please
Don't take this out of the village, don't take it out of the village
I beg you to accept this from me.
You beat him so much.
Ask him to forgive me this time.
Radha, this is not your decision.
Do not take responsibility for this.
This will bring disgrace to your family.
You will also be infamous in the village - no
It doesn't do anything any more.
He doesn't look down on anyone any more.
If he bothers a girl,
I will kill him myself.
I promise you it won't do anything else
I beg you to forgive me.
For my sake, forgive him this time, he won't do anything wrong again.
Get him out of the village - no
If you leave your foot outside the door,
I will break your pen, do you understand?
Why did you get these bracelets without my permission?
Why?
Being beautiful - quiet
Manglua, ask the groom's family, who are you here?
I'm in a hurry, go-but dad
I am still very young - Jalasingh shoot me kill me.
What did you establish?
Nothing nothing show me you want to see?
This is my weapon, I stole it.
I want to kill Suki Lala.
If you kill him... what happens to you-I don't care
I don't care if the police execute me or if they cut me to pieces.
If they want to kill me, let them kill me.
If they empty their guns in my chest, I will be happy.
But I want to kill Suki Lala.
Don't ask... don't give me the gun.
I endured a lot to raise you.
You don't know, you don't know.
You don't know how hard I endured for you to grow up ask.
Birjo, you don't think about your mother at all.
How can I live without you, Birjo?
I can't live without you, I can't.
Do you want to make me happy?
Drop this gun.
Do you want to create another disaster for me?- Mom
As long as Suki Lala is alive, these troubles will not end.
Are you worried about me dying?
What if Birjo dies?
With my death, the girls of the village are happy.
The products that people harvest go to their homes and they cook food with them.
With Birjoy's death, the era of tyrannical rule ends.
With my death, the life of all the people in the village will be better.
No, Birjo, nothing happens with a gun.
Nothing can be done with a gun with a gun.
You can't make the women of the village raise their heads.
Wheat cannot enter people's houses with a gun.
You can't light their house on fire with a gun see me see me.
I raised you and Ramu with 5 hectares of land.
At that time we did not even have food to eat
I was alone then, but now there are three of us we have food.
We have cows.
Don't lose hope, my son.
We try to work hard.
God changes our times.
The life of all the people in the village will change.
Give up - don't ask
No, I won't let you go.
Come on - no Birjo, no... Ramo, Ramo.
Ramu, come and ask for help.
Ramu, take the gun from him, he has stolen this gun.
Let it go, please let it go.
Birjo, let it go - let it go, Birjo
Mom, break the gun mom.
Don't beg, my son, don't go.
Don't beg, don't go.
Don't ask Birjo-You are not a mother, I am not your son
Don't go, my son, don't go.
Birjo.
Birjo Birjo, don't go because of me don't ask.
Ramu Ramu bride bride
!Thief! Thief.
Jala Singh He has come where are you bahar Singh.
He wants to kill me.
Birjo.
Birjo... Birjo... Birjo.
I brought the bangles, mom.
No, my son, don't ask.
Let go of my hand - master
His hands are bloody, master
He must have hidden it somewhere.
He sent his son to kill me.
Brothers, help someone set this on fire.

Set the hay on fire and it will burn.

Birjo Birjo.
Abji Radha Abji Radha.
Call her mother, not sister my mother's mother.
Birjo is coming - where is he?
Where is it? Birjo... birjo.
Birjo Where is my Birjo?
Birju, you sent me a letter Abji Radha.
He wants to steal my money from the wedding table.
The bridegroom's caravan has come here, no one can stop it except you.
Abji Radha, I have never begged you for anything.
Forgive me, Abji Radha
I fall at your feet -
I forgive you, Lala
Mom, do you forgive me?
This is our enemy, Birjo is doing the right thing.
Ramu.
She is not just Lala's daughter, she is the daughter of this village.
Rupiah's reputation is mine.
Your reputation is the reputation of all the people of the village.
Lala, go start the wedding,
I accept the responsibility.
Birjo, I don't do anything.
Ramu, bring my staff mom.
Birjo-Mom
Birjo, where did you go?
What does this look like?
Come down.
Let's go home, I won't let you leave the house again.
Don't beg, don't beg.
Don't beg, let go, mom.
If you go, they will kill you
I'm killing you - let go mom
Don't go, I will give you my life.
Mom, let go - don't ask beg - let go
Birjo.
Birjo, you came on time
I swear to God, I was waiting to see you.
Give my mother's bangles
I took good care of them, my son.
Don't go anywhere, I'm going to bring them now what are you doing my son
I am going to get a bracelet what are you doing my son I am old.
Still like naughty children.
Just as mischievous.
Sit down bro, you will get tired.
Birjo, did you forget that you took my umbrella and ran away?
I followed you to ask for my umbrella, but you were running away.
Look, my son is still as shiny as before.
Birjo, now the calculations will be mixed, this one's will be that's, his's will be this's.
No, don't ask.
Burning these is a sin - I learned all your knowledge
With this knowledge, you get three quarters of our product as profit.
You made us poor.
With this knowledge, you stole our land, you stole our cattle.
You took my father from us and put a black bracelet around my mother's hand.
One hectare of land for one kilo of rice.
You took a handful of nuts in your hand and wanted to take away a woman's honour and dignity.
My son, I brought you those nuts
I remember everything, Suki,
I remember everything well.
I will take revenge for everything from you.
You are a bandit, I am a bandit.
I don't care about the law
I don't care about you.
Dad.
Birjo, you had a fight with
Suki, Suki's work is over.
Get out of my way.
Birjo Ma man promised the people of the village.
I am ready to lose my life for my mother's promise.
But I won't let you lose money.
Ramu go aside.
Go to Ramu, mother needs you.
I swore to my mother that
I will not pass the money.
No.
Mom, mom, save us.
Mom, save me.
Mom, save me.
Stay there.
Pupa don't Pupa.
Wait, Pupa, wait aunt.
Aunt, save me - Birjo
Let go of the money.
Otherwise I will kill you.
You can't kill me, you are my mother
I am a woman - I am a boy
Pupa is the daughter of all the people in the village, she is my pride.
Birjo, I can sacrifice my son.
But I can't trample my pride.
If you can kill me, kill me, I can't break my oath.
Birjo.
Birjo.
Birjo.
Birjo.
Birjo
