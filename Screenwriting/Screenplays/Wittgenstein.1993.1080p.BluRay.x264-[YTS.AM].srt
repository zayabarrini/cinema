3

Hello.

7
00:00:56,967 --> 00:00:59,042
My name is Ludwig Wittgenstein.

8
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:00,971
I'm a prodigy.

9
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:03,087
I'm going to tell you my story.

10
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:07,269
I was born in 1889
to a filthy-rich family in Vienna.

11
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,385
I would like to introduce them to you.

12
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:11,898
<i>(Fanfare)
- This is my mother, Leopoldine.</i>

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,015
<i>She was crazy about music.</i>

14
00:01:15,068 --> 00:01:18,571
In fact, she was so busy
entertaining Brahms and Mahler

15
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:22,315
that we were left with the 26 tutors
and seven grand pianos.

16
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:25,954
<i>Hermine, my oldest sister,
was an amateur painter.</i>

17
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:31,418
Gretyl married an American
and was psychoanalysed by Freud.

18
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:34,827
Of Helene, we will remain silent.

19
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,288
<i>Three of my brothers died young.</i>

20
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,303
Hans ran away to America to escape dad,
and disappeared off a boat in Chesapeake Bay.

21
00:01:42,345 --> 00:01:47,058
<i>Kurt's troops rebelled in the First World War
and the shame drove him to suicide.</i>

22
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:51,302
<i>Rudolf, who was bent,
spent most of his time in Berlin.</i>

23
00:01:51,354 --> 00:01:56,568
<i>When he wasn't being theatrical, he hung out
at the Scientific Humanitarian Committee.</i>

24
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:00,394
<i>He topped himself drinking a glass of cyanide
in his favourite bar.</i>

25
00:02:00,446 --> 00:02:04,492
That leaves Paul. He was a concert pianist,
but lost an arm in the war.

26
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:09,163
<i>Ravel composed the
Concerto for the Left Hand especially for him.</i>

27
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:13,751
And as for Dad, he was always in the office
investing in American bonds.

28
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:16,546
That's how we escaped inflation
and stayed rich -

29
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:18,715
mega-rich - like the Rockefellers.

30
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:20,831
(Gentle music)

31
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,614
<i>In art, it is hard to say anything
as good as saying nothing.</i>

32
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:45,945
<i>Even to have expressed false thought boldly
and clearly is to have gained a great deal.</i>

33
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:07,706
Of time.

34
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:13,045
The horrors of hell
can be experienced in a single day.

35
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:15,391
That's plenty of time.

<i>I was to spend a lifetime
disentangling myself from my education.</i>

39
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:34,952
<i>"Quite the best to be had in Vienna," Mum said.</i>

40
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:39,873
<i>I shared a history teacher with Adolf Hitler.</i>

41
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:41,990

48

If someone is merely ahead of time,

49
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:50,517

52
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,081
Hail, earthling.

53
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:06,793
Earthling?
I'm a philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein.

54
00:07:06,835 --> 00:07:08,337
<i>Who are you?</i>

55
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:11,496
You could call me Mr Green.

56
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:14,217
May I ask you a question?

57
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:17,429
How many toes do philosophers have?

58
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:18,930
Ten.

59
00:07:20,015 --> 00:07:22,090
Fascinating.

60
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,634
That's how many humans have.

61
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:30,442
Mr Green, philosophers are humans
and know how many toes they have.

62
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,027
Oh dear.

63
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:37,741
Does that mean
Martians can't be philosophers?

64
00:07:37,783 --> 00:07:40,660
- Oh, God.

Why won't you just admit
there's no rhinoceros in this room?

74

Because, Professor Russell,
the world is made up of facts, not things.

75

Look for yourself.

I tell you for a fact,
there is no rhinoceros in this room!

77

The issue is metaphysical, not empirical.

would be yours.

which cannot be reconciled with one another,

160
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:26,966
then each calls the other a fool or a heretic.

161
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:29,093
(Gunfire and artillery fire)

162
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:41,439
I'm hated because I'm a volunteer!

163
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:46,955
I'm surrounded by people who hate me.

164
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:52,325
The nearness of death
will bring me the light of life.

165
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:55,661
God, enlighten me.

166
00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:57,788
God, enlighten me!

167
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:03,419
I am a worm.

168
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:07,006
Pray God that I become a man.

169
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:10,509
God be with me.

170
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:13,721
God be with me!

171
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:15,848
Amen!

172
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,045
I know this world exists.

173
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,091
But its meaning is problematic.

174
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:55,304
<i>Am I good or am I evil?</i>

175
00:17:57,525 --> 00:18:05,658
When my conscience upsets my equilibrium,
then I am not in agreement with something.

176
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:12,446
What is it?

177
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:15,574
Is it the world?

178
00:18:16,794 --> 00:18:18,869
Or is it God?

179
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:41,110
Wittgenstein has been taken prisoner.

180
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:43,227
Oh, how fascinating!

181
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:48,409
"I am a prisoner of war
in Monte Cassino under the Italians.

182
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:52,569
I hope we shall see each other after the war.

183
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:58,408
Being shot at many times
has altered the way I think about philosophy.

184
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:04,091
<i>So has Tolstoy's Gospel In Brief.</i>

185
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:11,807
<i>I have written a book called
Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.</i>

186
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:18,105
It combines logical symbolism
with religious mysticism.

187
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:25,404
It's better with no shoes, no shoes at all.

188
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:28,564
Love, Ludwig."

189
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:30,910
I must send him some more cocoa tablets.

190
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:33,026
Sounds like he's rather depressed.

191
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,072
Does he know you've been in prison, Bertie?

192
00:19:37,124 --> 00:19:39,001
I doubt it.

193
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:42,338
Such nice manners always, Ludwig.

194
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:45,664
Good stock.

195
00:19:48,594 --> 00:19:51,086
What is logical symbolism?

196
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:54,214
Oh, it's too difficult to explain.

197
00:19:55,684 --> 00:20:00,345
That's the trouble with you, Bertie.
You can never answer a straight question.

198
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,444
(Church bells ring)

199
00:20:07,154 --> 00:20:12,034
I was released from prison camp
on the 21st of August, 1919.

200
00:20:13,118 --> 00:20:17,498
<i>I wanted to get my Tractatus published,
so I went back to Vienna.</i>

201
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:20,031
(Dramatic piano music)

202
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,055
Ludwig!

203
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:48,487
Ludwig, what do you mean
you want to teach in a rural school?

204
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:51,782
It would be like a precision instrument
opening crates.

205
00:20:51,824 --> 00:20:53,899
Look, you were decorated in the war.

206
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:57,319
Bertrand Russell
says you're the great philosophical hope.

207
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:59,946
<i>You can't go and teach in the provinces.</i>

208
00:20:59,998 --> 00:21:04,086
Hermine, you remind me of someone
looking out through a closed window

209
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:07,798
<i>who cannot explain the strange movements
of someone outside.</i>

210
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,801
You can't tell what sort of storm is raging,

211
00:21:10,842 --> 00:21:14,763
or that this person might only be managing
to stay on his feet with difficulty.

212
00:21:15,847 --> 00:21:18,642
Well, I still think it's a waste of your talents.

213
00:21:18,684 --> 00:21:21,520
If you hadn't been so daft
and given all your money to us,

214
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:26,024
you could publish your book yourself,
without having to bow and scrape to publishers.

215
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:29,987
I don't want to force my philosophy
on the world, if a publisher won't publish it.

216
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:31,686
Can't you understand that?

217
00:21:32,781 --> 00:21:36,952
Well, I would rather have a happy person
for a brother than an unhappy saint.

218
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,832
I am going to teach.

219
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:48,453
CHILDREN:? Three blind mice

220
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:53,249
"Those truth possibilities of its truth-argument

221
00:21:53,301 --> 00:21:59,255
which verify... and prositions...
I shall call its truth grounds..."

222
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:04,052
Yes, good.

223
00:22:04,104 --> 00:22:07,107
Proposition. So what is this here?

224
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:10,767
What do you call this here?

225
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,895
Logic.

226
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,524
What's this here?

227
00:22:19,911 --> 00:22:21,986
What do you call this here?

228
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:36,209
Teaching you
is a... thoroughly... unrewarding experience.

229
00:22:37,304 --> 00:22:39,097
Do you understand what I'm saying?

230
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:44,269
Do you understand what I'm saying?

231
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:51,224
It's a waste of time.

232
00:22:51,276 --> 00:22:55,937
It's a waste of my time,
your time, everybody's time.

233
00:22:57,741 --> 00:23:01,161
Do you understand...
Do you understand what I'm saying?

234
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:05,571
Oh, my God!

235
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,908
Oh, my dear, dear God!

236
00:23:16,092 --> 00:23:18,584
<i>Teaching proved to be a sham.</i>

237
00:23:19,637 --> 00:23:21,712
<i>I had to "do a runner"...</i>

238
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:25,810
<i>...and lie about my brutality towards the children.</i>

239
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:33,975
<i>They just weren't any good at logic or maths,
and they drove me crazy.</i>

240
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:39,073
<i>I kidded myself that my background and class
weren't important,</i>

241
00:23:39,115 --> 00:23:44,819
<i>but I stood out like a sore thumb
at these provincial schools.</i>

242
00:23:46,456 --> 00:23:50,710
<i>The parents hated me and called me strange.</i>

243
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:54,370
<i>I felt guilty for years.</i>

244
00:23:54,422 --> 00:23:56,497
<i>Somehow I had failed.</i>

245
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:59,583
<i>Morally.</i>

246
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:07,174
This is a red pillar box.

247
00:24:07,227 --> 00:24:09,302
How do you know that?

248
00:24:09,354 --> 00:24:11,178
I've done my homework.

249
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:14,765
Green is green.

250
00:24:14,817 --> 00:24:16,976
Children learn by believing adults.

251
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:19,103
Doubt comes after belief.

252
00:24:19,155 --> 00:24:21,699
I know what I believe.

253
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:27,747
Where I come from there are no adults,
and so no doubts.

254
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:35,880
If I post this letter to New York, does that
strengthen my conviction that the earth exists?

255
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:38,716
The earth does exist.

256
00:24:38,758 --> 00:24:41,594
And so do Martians.

257
00:24:41,636 --> 00:24:44,263
(Xylophone)

258
00:24:44,305 --> 00:24:46,380
(Ticking)

259
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:53,554
Well, you end the book with the line,

260
00:24:53,606 --> 00:24:57,224
"Whereof one cannot speak,
thereof one must remain silent."

261
00:24:58,277 --> 00:25:00,352
Why didn't you?

262
00:25:00,405 --> 00:25:03,658
I don't understand a word, Ludwig.
It's gobbledygook.

263
00:25:03,699 --> 00:25:05,774
How much were you paid for this?

264
00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:11,541
I was paid nothing for the rights,
and will receive no royalties.

265
00:25:11,582 --> 00:25:15,284
Typical. You won't be able
to buy a pair of socks soon.

266
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:17,411
But I have published a book.

267
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:19,340
I heard that the book was only published

268
00:25:19,382 --> 00:25:21,790
because Bertrand Russell
wrote an introduction.

269
00:25:22,885 --> 00:25:25,263
<i>LUDWIG: I have Russell's introduction.</i>

270
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:27,379
<i>He can't understand a word either.</i>

271
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:29,256
HERMINE: Who can?

272
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:34,219
Hermine, we must improve ourselves.

273
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,403
That's all we can do to better the world.

274
00:25:41,445 --> 00:25:44,365
Is it true you're designing Gretyl
a brand-new house?

275
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:46,482
That's right. The whole thing.

276
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:51,831
<i>Right down to the window latches
and the door handles.</i>

277
00:25:52,498 --> 00:25:55,616
Well, I hope it's more comprehensible
than your book.

278
00:25:59,046 --> 00:26:01,121
(Phone rings)

279
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:07,555
Maynard?

280
00:26:07,596 --> 00:26:09,390
<i>- Maynard?
- Waistcoat!</i>

281
00:26:09,432 --> 00:26:10,891
Ah.

282
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:13,769
His book is obscure and too short.

283
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:15,636
But good.

284
00:26:15,688 --> 00:26:17,481
My introduction got it published.

285
00:26:17,523 --> 00:26:20,609
Yes, but I still think
we should get him back to Cambridge.

286
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:22,810
Maynard, we're going to be late.

287
00:26:22,862 --> 00:26:25,354
You're going to have to sort out his grants.

288
00:26:25,406 --> 00:26:29,452
In a moment of amnesia, he gave away
all his money to his brothers and sisters.

289
00:26:29,493 --> 00:26:31,454
An absolute fortune, I'm told.

290
00:26:31,495 --> 00:26:33,622
If I can sort out the economies of the world,

291
00:26:33,664 --> 00:26:36,459
I ought to be able to sort out a stipend
for Wittgenstein.

292
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,994
<i>- That is, if Cambridge will still have him.
- Oh, I'm sure they'll have him.</i>

293
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:44,800
<i>His Tractatus is all the rage,
whatever we may think of it.</i>

294
00:26:44,842 --> 00:26:47,469
Well, leave it to me, I know how to get him back.

295
00:26:48,846 --> 00:26:51,724
Oh, er, Maynard, hold on a moment, I just...

296
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:55,384
Johnny, do you feel like a trip to Vienna?

297
00:26:56,478 --> 00:26:58,063
Vienna?

298
00:26:58,105 --> 00:27:00,180
(Choir chants)

299
00:27:21,045 --> 00:27:23,120
Dr Wittgenstein.

300
00:27:24,173 --> 00:27:26,248
<i>Dr Wittgenstein.</i>

301
00:27:34,892 --> 00:27:36,967
I've come to take you home.

302
00:27:38,228 --> 00:27:40,303
Home?

303
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:42,430
- Where's that?
- Cambridge.

304
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:44,558
Cambridge.

305
00:27:45,611 --> 00:27:47,686
God help me.

306
00:27:48,739 --> 00:27:51,314
I have letters from Mr Keynes and Mr Russell.

307
00:27:53,077 --> 00:27:55,152
I should introduce myself.

308
00:27:55,204 --> 00:27:57,279
Johnny.

309
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:08,383
Mr Russell asked me to tell you
that you're the greatest philosopher of our time.

310
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:10,500
Well...

311
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,381
Tell me, Johnny, are you a philosopher?

312
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:18,091
Yes.

313
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:20,218
Are you happy?

314
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:25,223
You know, you really should give it up.

315
00:28:26,818 --> 00:28:29,112
Get out while you still can.

316
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:31,229

Ah, Maynard.

00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:57,015
God has arrived. He was on the 5:15 train.

320
00:28:57,057 --> 00:29:01,228
Are you sure it's a good idea bringing him here,
Maynard?

321
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:05,482
I've heard he's difficult and peculiar.

322
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:09,736
A philosopher is a citizen of no community.

323
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:15,367
Does he make fit with Bloomsbury friends?

324
00:29:16,451 --> 00:29:22,290
He seems so heavy-handed and Germanic.

325
00:29:22,332 --> 00:29:24,407
Yes, he is.

326
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:27,911
Why are you all so interesting in him?

327
00:29:27,963 --> 00:29:30,715
Because he's a genius, Lydoushka.

328
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,084
Yes, but what is he doing?

329
00:29:35,137 --> 00:29:38,171
He's trying to define for us
the limits of language.

330
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:41,257
And what it is to have communication,
one with another.

331
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:45,105
Don't be so pompous.

332
00:29:45,146 --> 00:29:48,264
Dearest darling, I am going to be pompous.

333
00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:51,236
The country needs
more than one decent philosopher.

334
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:55,282
Bertie needs some competition.
Our Viennese import might just do the trick.

335
00:29:56,366 --> 00:30:04,280
Maynardoushka, your head
is infinitely more flexible than my legs.

336
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:43,913
What are you doing?
Everyone's waiting for you.

337
00:30:45,707 --> 00:30:47,782
Go away, please!

338
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,909
They're torturing me!

339
00:30:51,755 --> 00:30:53,579
For God's sake, just open your mouth

340
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:56,123
and say the first thing
that comes into your head.

341
00:30:56,176 --> 00:30:58,251
Don't be so ridiculous.

342
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:03,266
Listen, just get through this seminar
and we can go to the cinema.

343
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,173
A dog... cannot lie.

344
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,375
<i>Neither can he be sincere.</i>

345
00:31:42,096 --> 00:31:45,767
A dog may be expecting his master to come.

346
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:49,771
Why can't he be expecting him
to come next Wednesday?

347
00:31:52,231 --> 00:31:54,525
Is it because he doesn't have language?

348
00:31:57,862 --> 00:32:04,202
If a lion could speak, we would not
be able to understand what he said.

349
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:09,446
Why do I say such a thing?

350
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:15,671
If we could understand him, I shouldn't think
we'd have too much trouble with a lion.

351
00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:17,621
We could get an interpreter.

352
00:32:18,716 --> 00:32:21,094
Do you mean for me or for the lion?

353
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:24,138
<i>Yes, yes, we...we could get an interpreter.</i>

354
00:32:25,223 --> 00:32:27,298
But what possible use would that be?

355
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:30,269
To imagine a language
is to imagine a form of life.

356
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:36,692
It's what we do and who we are
that gives meaning to our words.

357
00:32:36,734 --> 00:32:41,030
I can't understand the lion's language,
because I don't know what his world is like.

358
00:32:41,072 --> 00:32:43,908
How can I know the world a lion inhabits?

359
00:32:47,703 --> 00:32:53,209
Do I fail to understand him
because I can't peer into his mind?

360
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,175
(Whispering)

361
00:33:26,075 --> 00:33:33,040
What's going on behind my words,
when I say, "This is a very pleasant pineapple"?

362
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:37,367
<i>No, please, take your time.</i>

363
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,495
<i>STUDENT: The thought, Professor.</i>

364
00:33:39,547 --> 00:33:41,622
I see.

365
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:49,087
And what is the thought that lies behind
the words, "This is a very pleasant pineapple"?

366
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,381
This is a very pleasant pineapple.

367
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:53,508
Listen to me.

368
00:33:53,561 --> 00:34:00,182
We imagine the meaning of what we say as
something queer, mysterious, hidden from view.

369
00:34:00,234 --> 00:34:03,237
But nothing is hidden!
Everything is open to view!

370
00:34:05,614 --> 00:34:07,689
It's just...

371
00:34:07,741 --> 00:34:11,787
it's just philosophers who muddy the waters.

372
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:13,820
<i>STUDENT: Professor Wittgenstein.</i>

373
00:34:14,915 --> 00:34:16,990
You can't know this pain.

374
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:19,503
Only I can.

375
00:34:19,545 --> 00:34:21,620
Are you sure you know it?

376
00:34:21,672 --> 00:34:23,966
You don't doubt you had a pain just then?

377
00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:26,416
How could I?

378
00:34:26,468 --> 00:34:30,003
If we can't speak of doubt here,
we can't speak of knowledge either.

379
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:32,391
I don't follow.

380
00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:34,727
It makes no sense
to speak of knowing something

381
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:37,146
in a context where
we could not possibly doubt it.

382
00:34:37,187 --> 00:34:40,972
Therefore to say, "I know I am in pain,"
is entirely senseless.

383
00:34:42,067 --> 00:34:47,145
When you want to know the meaning of a word,
don't look inside yourself,

384
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,951
look at the uses of the word in our way of life.

385
00:34:52,036 --> 00:34:54,111
Look at how we behave.

386
00:34:55,622 --> 00:34:58,740
Are you saying
there are no philosophical problems?

387
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:01,086
There are...

388
00:35:01,128 --> 00:35:03,203
linguistic,

389
00:35:03,255 --> 00:35:05,664
mathematical, ethical,

390
00:35:05,716 --> 00:35:10,095
logistic and... religious problems,

391
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:13,755
but there are
no genuine philosophical problems!

392
00:35:15,476 --> 00:35:17,936
You're trivialising philosophy.

393
00:35:17,978 --> 00:35:22,858
Philosophy is just
a by-product of misunderstanding language!

394
00:35:25,152 --> 00:35:27,227
Why don't you realise that?

395
00:35:30,574 --> 00:35:34,025
Oh, dear. He can't bear disagreement, can he?

396
00:36:02,064 --> 00:36:04,139
What are you doing?

397
00:36:04,191 --> 00:36:06,902
Making notes on your class before I forget it.

398
00:36:06,943 --> 00:36:09,018
Are you mad? You'll ruin the plot.

399
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:11,146
Shh.

400
00:36:11,198 --> 00:36:13,992
There is no plot.

401
00:36:17,162 --> 00:36:19,237
There might be.

402
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,948
Put it away.

403
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,075
Put it away this instant.

404
00:36:30,842 --> 00:36:33,220
What did you say about Fortnum & Mason?

405
00:36:34,388 --> 00:36:36,462
Don't be ridiculous.

406
00:36:50,237 --> 00:36:53,657
<i>LUDWIG AS AN ADULT: There was no
competition between the cinema and seminar.</i>

407
00:36:53,698 --> 00:36:55,773
<i>I loved films.</i>

408
00:36:55,826 --> 00:36:57,901
<i>Especially westerns and musicals.</i>

409
00:36:57,953 --> 00:37:02,499
<i>Carmen Miranda and Betty Hutton
were my favourite actresses.</i>

410
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:07,744
<i>I always sat in the front row.</i>

411
00:37:08,797 --> 00:37:13,176
<i>Film felt like a shower bath,
washing away the lecture.</i>

412
00:37:15,262 --> 00:37:17,337
<i>I hated the newsreels.</i>

413
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:19,464
<i>Far too patriotic.</i>

414
00:37:20,517 --> 00:37:23,968
<i>I felt the makers
must have been master pupils of Goebbels.</i>

415
00:37:27,816 --> 00:37:33,029
<i>As for playing the national anthem at the end,
I'd sneak out.</i>

416
00:37:36,574 --> 00:37:38,649
(Graceful piano music)

417
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:52,580
Come on, Maynard!

418
00:37:52,632 --> 00:37:54,707
Speed it up.

419
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,430
Can't go any faster, it's making me giddy.

420
00:37:58,471 --> 00:38:00,546
Should I go any faster, Ludwig?

421
00:38:00,598 --> 00:38:04,686
No, no, you keep going as you are. Come on
Maynard, keep it up, keep it up, keep it up!

422
00:38:04,728 --> 00:38:06,886
You're slowing the whole thing down.

423
00:38:08,148 --> 00:38:09,941
I'm done for.

424
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:12,277
You've ruined the whole thing!

425
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:14,195
<i>We were just getting into rhythm.</i>

426
00:38:14,237 --> 00:38:16,990
Go away and play with someone else!

427
00:38:17,031 --> 00:38:19,106
All right.

428
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:22,620
You can be the sun this time. It's easier.

429
00:38:22,662 --> 00:38:24,737
<i>I'll be the earth,</i>

430
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:26,864
<i>and Lydia can be the moon.</i>

431
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:29,460
We take rest.

432
00:38:29,502 --> 00:38:31,004
<i>Take tea.</i>

433
00:38:31,045 --> 00:38:33,120
Come along, Maynard.

434
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:40,127
Oh, dear.

435
00:38:41,431 --> 00:38:43,756
I wonder where I went wrong?

436
00:38:57,655 --> 00:39:02,035
Oh, Bertie, do listen to this.
It's Julian Bell's satirical poem of Ludwig.

437
00:39:03,077 --> 00:39:06,247
"For he talks nonsense,
numerous statements makes

438
00:39:06,289 --> 00:39:08,781
Forever his own vow of silence breaks

439
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:14,703
Ethics, aesthetics, talks of day and night
and calls things good or bad and wrong or right

440
00:39:15,798 --> 00:39:20,876
Who on any issue ever saw
Ludwig refrain from laying down the law?

441
00:39:20,928 --> 00:39:25,975
In every company he shouts us down
and stops our sentence stuttering his own

442
00:39:26,017 --> 00:39:31,939
Unceasing argues, harsh, irate and loud,
sure that he's right and of his rightness proud

443
00:39:31,981 --> 00:39:38,070
Such faults are common, shared by all in part,
but Wittgenstein pontificates on art"

444
00:39:40,406 --> 00:39:46,443
WittersGitters, WittersGitters, WittersGitters!

445
00:39:46,496 --> 00:39:51,125
Fairy, fairy, fairy!

446
00:39:53,252 --> 00:39:54,879
Idiot!

447
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:05,932
What does this mean?

448
00:40:05,973 --> 00:40:08,684
It's a gesture of contempt.

449
00:40:08,726 --> 00:40:12,177
A cyclist did this to me
as I was crossing the road.

450
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:16,067
I decided then and there to kill myself.

451
00:40:16,108 --> 00:40:19,226
Are you coming to the Palladium with us
this evening?

452
00:40:19,278 --> 00:40:23,147
What's the logical structure of this gesture?

453
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,275
It doesn't have one!

454
00:40:27,328 --> 00:40:31,082
That means I've spent most of my life
groping down a blind alley.

455
00:40:31,123 --> 00:40:36,962
Isn't it rather an over-reaction to kill yourself,
because somebody gives you a V-sign?

456
00:40:38,047 --> 00:40:41,300
Philosophy hunts for the essence of meaning.

457
00:40:42,134 --> 00:40:44,845
There's no such thing.
There's no such thing!

458
00:40:45,596 --> 00:40:48,849
Just the way we do things in everyday life
and things like that.

459
00:40:48,891 --> 00:40:50,716
The college porter knows that.

460
00:40:50,768 --> 00:40:54,136
Is that what you're planning to do
for the rest of your life?

461
00:40:54,188 --> 00:40:56,565
L-I shall start by committing suicide.

462
00:40:56,607 --> 00:40:58,567
Champagne before you go?

463
00:40:58,609 --> 00:41:00,684
Um, do you know...

464
00:41:00,736 --> 00:41:03,489
l-I'd love a cup of tea.

465
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:26,543
How like a philosopher to hate philosophy.

466
00:41:27,596 --> 00:41:30,714
He thinks ordinary working people
have the answers.

467
00:41:30,766 --> 00:41:32,841
He wants me to give up philosophy.

468
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:35,385
Perhaps I should.

469
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,191
Philosophy just states what everyone admits.

470
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:42,319
How does philosophy take the measure of this?

471
00:41:46,574 --> 00:41:48,648
It's not supposed to.

472
00:41:48,701 --> 00:41:52,152
It'd be like complaining
that you can't play a tune on a carrot.

473
00:41:52,204 --> 00:41:54,279
Precisely.

474
00:41:54,331 --> 00:41:56,406
<i>Do you think philosophy is useless?</i>

475
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,533
Oh, no.

476
00:41:59,628 --> 00:42:01,839
It serves Ludwig as a therapy.

477
00:42:02,923 --> 00:42:04,998
Are you going to take his advice?

478
00:42:06,844 --> 00:42:08,919
I was destined for the pit.

479
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,255
My parents gave up everything to get me here.

480
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:16,228
<i>I'd be quite happy to go back,</i>

481
00:42:17,312 --> 00:42:19,387
but it would break their hearts.

482
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,105
Well, what about Aristotle?

483
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,275
What about Aristotle?

484
00:42:33,328 --> 00:42:35,403
L-I've never read Aristotle.

485
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:39,533
What can he tell us, anyway?

486
00:42:39,585 --> 00:42:43,536
The answers are in Tolstoy,
Dostoevsky and Saint Matthew.

487
00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:45,664
How marvellous!

488
00:42:45,716 --> 00:42:48,208
I didn't know you were a Christian, Ludwig!

489
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,511
<i>I'm not.</i>

490
00:42:49,553 --> 00:42:53,849
It's just that I look at everything
from a religious point of view.

491
00:42:55,142 --> 00:42:58,593
Why is there anything at all
rather than just nothing?

492
00:42:59,688 --> 00:43:02,399
Well, how the bloody blue blazes
should I know?

493
00:43:02,441 --> 00:43:04,651
I'm the woman. You are the philosopher.

494
00:43:04,693 --> 00:43:07,894
The most important part of my philosophy
hasn't been written.

495
00:43:07,946 --> 00:43:10,355
I can't write it. It can never be written.

496
00:43:10,407 --> 00:43:14,359
Oh, bunkum! A full English breakfast
and a spot of application.

497
00:43:14,411 --> 00:43:16,903
It doubt it'll be understood in the future.

498
00:43:16,955 --> 00:43:21,950
People, culture, the air,
everything will be different in the future.

499
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:24,327
We're mutating.

500
00:43:26,256 --> 00:43:30,093
You know, your obsession with perfection
is quite, quite ludicrous.

501
00:43:31,178 --> 00:43:34,139
I want to be perfect, don't you?

502
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:36,641
Christ, no.

503
00:43:36,683 --> 00:43:39,801
- Then I don't see how we can be friends.
- Neither do I.

504
00:43:46,777 --> 00:43:52,449
I used to believe
that language gave us a picture of the world.

505
00:43:53,909 --> 00:43:57,954
But it can't give us a picture of how it does that.

506
00:43:59,122 --> 00:44:03,210
That would be like trying to see yourself
seeing something.

507
00:44:06,379 --> 00:44:11,176
How language does that is beyond expression.

508
00:44:13,386 --> 00:44:15,461
That is the mystery.

509
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,675
That was all wrong.

510
00:44:21,728 --> 00:44:25,982
Language isn't a picture at all.

511
00:44:26,024 --> 00:44:28,099
What is it, then?

512
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,935
It's...

513
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,105
...a tool.

514
00:44:34,157 --> 00:44:36,232
An instrument.

515
00:44:37,577 --> 00:44:41,988
There isn't just one picture of the world,
there are lots of different language games,

516
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,742
different forms of life,
different ways of doing things with words.

517
00:44:45,794 --> 00:44:47,420
They don't all hang together!

518
00:44:47,462 --> 00:44:49,537
What do you mean?

519
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:55,585
All I mean is the limits of my language
are the limits of my world.

520
00:44:55,637 --> 00:44:59,307
We keep running up
against the walls of our cage.

521
00:45:07,732 --> 00:45:09,807
I'm terribly sorry.

522
00:45:12,779 --> 00:45:14,854
You have a worthless teacher today.

523
00:45:14,906 --> 00:45:16,564
I...

524
00:45:16,616 --> 00:45:18,858
I'm all cleaned out.

525
00:45:21,121 --> 00:45:23,196
Please forgive me.

526
00:45:23,248 --> 00:45:24,874
That was quite masterly.

527
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:28,451
<i>- It was frightful.
- I don't know.</i>

528
00:45:28,503 --> 00:45:30,578
Made me feel like a vegetable.

529
00:45:31,673 --> 00:45:33,550
How could it possibly?

530
00:45:33,591 --> 00:45:36,386
It doesn't feel like anything to be a vegetable.

531
00:45:36,427 --> 00:45:39,180
<i>STUDENT: I just can't see it, Professor.</i>

532
00:45:39,222 --> 00:45:42,506
It somehow just seems natural to me to say,
"I know I'm in pain."

533
00:45:43,601 --> 00:45:47,303
Oh... natural.

534
00:45:48,398 --> 00:45:50,859
Tell me,

535
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,185
why does it seem more natural

536
00:45:54,237 --> 00:46:01,452
for people to believe that the sun goes round
the earth, rather than the other way round?

537
00:46:02,537 --> 00:46:05,112
Well, obviously, because it looks that way.

538
00:46:05,164 --> 00:46:07,239
I see.

539
00:46:07,292 --> 00:46:09,919
Then how would it look
if the earth went round the sun?

540
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:12,036
Erm...

541
00:46:12,088 --> 00:46:14,163
well, I suppose...

542
00:46:18,678 --> 00:46:20,920
Yes, I see what you mean.

543
00:47:11,898 --> 00:47:14,609
<i>LUDWIG AS A BOY: Seminar, flick.</i>

544
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:16,611
(Gunfire and Native Americans whooping)

545
00:47:20,031 --> 00:47:22,106
<i>Seminar.</i>

546
00:47:22,158 --> 00:47:24,233
(Cavalry trumpet)

547
00:47:24,285 --> 00:47:26,360
Seminar.

548
00:47:27,872 --> 00:47:29,947
Flick.

549
00:47:36,297 --> 00:47:38,372
Seminar.

550
00:47:40,468 --> 00:47:42,543
Flick.

551
00:47:45,681 --> 00:47:47,756
<i>LUDWIG AS AN ADULT: On and on it went.</i>

552
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:52,010
<i>Cambridge, Cambridge, Cambridge.</i>

553
00:47:53,731 --> 00:47:56,609
<i>No wonder everyone dreamed of Moscow.</i>

554
00:47:57,651 --> 00:47:59,945
<i>Keynes and Russell had both been there.</i>

555
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:05,910
<i>Bertie, always the opportunist,
wrote a shilling shocker called</i>

556
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:08,746
<i>The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism.</i>

557
00:48:10,081 --> 00:48:12,156
<i>He condemned it out of hand.</i>

558
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:15,461
<i>But, as everyone knows,</i>

559
00:48:15,503 --> 00:48:19,006
<i>the best of the Cambridge lot became spies.</i>

560
00:48:20,091 --> 00:48:25,878
<i>My dream was to go to the Soviet Union
and work as a manual labourer.</i>

561
00:48:48,494 --> 00:48:51,914
<i>I've fixed you up a job
with a local engineering firm.</i>

562
00:48:52,957 --> 00:48:54,865
Why?

563
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:56,992
I thought you'd be pleased.

564
00:48:57,044 --> 00:48:59,588
You'd be working with your hands.

565
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:01,705
<i>You should do something useful.</i>

566
00:49:01,757 --> 00:49:03,749
But Ludwig,

567
00:49:03,801 --> 00:49:05,792
my training's academic.

568
00:49:05,844 --> 00:49:07,669
That's the challenge.

569
00:49:07,721 --> 00:49:11,642
I'm going to Russia.
I shall try to find us both manual jobs there.

570
00:49:11,684 --> 00:49:13,759
Why do you want to go to Russia?

571
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:16,355
Oh, by the way, you'll have to lend me a tie.

572
00:49:44,091 --> 00:49:50,128
Professor Wittgenstein, on behalf of the Institute
for Foreign Relations, I can offer you two things.

573
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,975
The chair in philosophy at Kazan University

574
00:49:53,016 --> 00:49:56,270
or a teaching post in philosophy
at Moscow University.

575
00:49:56,311 --> 00:49:58,386
Er, comrade, please.

576
00:49:58,438 --> 00:50:00,513
I don't want to teach.

577
00:50:00,566 --> 00:50:06,269
I want to work as a manual labourer,
either in a factory or on a collective farm.

578
00:50:06,321 --> 00:50:10,409
But, Professor, eto nyevozmozhno.
O chem vy govoritye?

579
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:14,663
Nyeuzheli vy nye ponimayetye?
Nu, kakoy iz vas kolkhoznik? Eto absurd.

580
00:50:14,705 --> 00:50:16,363
Chto?

581
00:50:16,415 --> 00:50:21,044
I'm terribly sorry, Professor Wittgenstein,
but this is absolutely out of the question.

582
00:50:21,086 --> 00:50:25,413
The one thing that is not in short supply
in the Soviet Union is unskilled labour.

583
00:50:26,508 --> 00:50:28,583
Da.

584
00:50:28,635 --> 00:50:30,710
<i>Da, da, Professor.</i>

585
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:35,507
<i>We must teach the frozen circumstances
to sing by playing them their own melody.</i>

586
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:39,688
Professor Wittgenstein,
I do recommend you to read more Hegel.

587
00:50:42,941 --> 00:50:44,985
Eto shutka.

588
00:50:45,027 --> 00:50:47,779
<i>I couldn't possibly read Hegel.</i>

589
00:50:47,821 --> 00:50:49,896
I'd go stark raving mad.

590
00:50:51,074 --> 00:50:54,411
Tell me, have you read Trotsky on art?

591
00:50:54,453 --> 00:50:57,570
<i>That's much more interesting.</i>

592
00:50:57,622 --> 00:51:00,031
Nyet, Professor, ya nye chitala Trotskogo.

593
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:04,463
Trotskiy - eto opasno.
Professor, ya nye ponimayu vas.

594
00:51:04,504 --> 00:51:07,674
Vy priyezhayetye v Moskvu, vy khotitye rabotat'

595
00:51:07,716 --> 00:51:11,762
v kolkhozye, vy khotitye, chtoby ya chitala
Trotskogo. No Trotskiy - eto opasno.

596
00:51:11,803 --> 00:51:14,973
Trotsky - eto Sibir'.
Vy ponimayetye? Trotsky - eto Sibir'.

597
00:51:15,015 --> 00:51:17,090
(Bell)
- Sleduyushchiy.

598
00:51:17,142 --> 00:51:19,217
Next one.

599
00:51:32,782 --> 00:51:34,857
How was Russia?

600
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:40,947
Well, at least Lenin's state
has ensured that there's no unemployment.

601
00:51:42,876 --> 00:51:45,420
It is an ordered society.

602
00:51:47,422 --> 00:51:49,497
Are you enjoying yourself?

603
00:51:49,549 --> 00:51:51,624
Yes, I am.

604
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:53,637
You were right.

605
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:56,598
<i>- Did you find yourself a job in Russia?
- Sadly, no.</i>

606
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,674
It looks like I'm stuck with Cambridge
and philosophy.

607
00:52:02,479 --> 00:52:05,106
Ludwig, give it up.

608
00:52:32,217 --> 00:52:34,594
What the hell are you playing at, Ludwig?

609
00:52:34,636 --> 00:52:36,711
I've just been talking to Johnny.

610
00:52:36,763 --> 00:52:38,838
What do you mean?

611
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:42,758
I mean all this poppycock
about engineering and him getting a job.

612
00:52:42,811 --> 00:52:45,188
What do you think his parents will think?

613
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:46,815
I haven't the foggiest.

614
00:52:46,856 --> 00:52:50,224
Johnny's parents are working people.

615
00:52:50,276 --> 00:52:52,487
His father's a miner.

616
00:52:52,529 --> 00:52:55,897
<i>They sacrificed everything they have
to get him to Cambridge.</i>

617
00:52:55,949 --> 00:52:58,357
What's Johnny's parents got to do with it?

618
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:02,539
Listen, Wittgenstein,
Johnny's parents are workers.

619
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:07,825
That's what you admire,
when it's confined to the pages of Tolstoy.

620
00:53:07,877 --> 00:53:10,964
I've never met Johnny's parents.

621
00:53:11,005 --> 00:53:13,080
I strongly advise you not to.

622
00:53:13,925 --> 00:53:17,929
You're foisting your own self-hatred
onto their son.

623
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,505
You've been reading Sigmund Freud.

624
00:53:21,557 --> 00:53:23,059
<i>What of it?</i>

625
00:53:24,143 --> 00:53:25,937
<i>It's dangerous stuff!</i>

626
00:53:25,979 --> 00:53:29,430
Believe me!
It takes one Viennese to know another.

627
00:53:29,482 --> 00:53:33,976
Freud's nothing to do with Johnny
sweating it out in some god-awful factory.

628
00:53:35,029 --> 00:53:37,240
You can't do this, Wittgenstein.

629
00:53:37,281 --> 00:53:41,577
<i>You can't use Johnny
as fodder for your own fantasies.</i>

630
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:44,163
What I do is none of your business.

631
00:53:44,205 --> 00:53:46,280
It's my business to stop you from...

632
00:53:46,332 --> 00:53:49,617
oh, what's your word,
"infecting" too many young men.

633
00:53:49,669 --> 00:53:52,422
You have a terrible power over them,
can't you see that?

634
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:56,874
<i>Half of Cambridge goes around
imitating your mannerisms.</i>

635
00:53:56,926 --> 00:54:00,127
You know I've never encouraged disciples.

636
00:54:01,222 --> 00:54:04,392
I'm talking about you, not your ideas.

637
00:54:04,434 --> 00:54:07,885
You lord it over others
and you don't even know it.

638
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:15,976
All aristocrats idealise the common folk,
as long as they keep stoking the boilers.

639
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:20,658
I should know, I was brought up like that, too.

640
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:26,737
If you're talking about my upbringing,
that was a long time ago!

641
00:54:26,789 --> 00:54:29,000
<i>In another country!</i>

642
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:32,826
How can I possibly speak to a man
who believes I corrupt others?

643
00:54:32,879 --> 00:54:35,715
I'm simply quoting your own words.

644
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:40,918
Russell,

645
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:46,475
I would like you to know
that our friendship is now over.

646
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,601
I had a fearful row with Russell yesterday.

647
00:55:30,102 --> 00:55:32,177
<i>He said I was an evil influence.</i>

648
00:55:33,647 --> 00:55:37,693
What is worrying you, Ludwig?
Is it your logic or your sins?

649
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:39,810
Both.

650
00:55:39,862 --> 00:55:41,363
My sins mostly.

651
00:55:41,405 --> 00:55:44,408
Sins, sinners, sinning.

652
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:47,119
What nonsense you do talk.

653
00:55:48,621 --> 00:55:52,124
Well, you mustn't expect
any sympathy from me. I'm not a virtuous man.

654
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:54,241
I never imagined you were.

655
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:04,710
Do you know, Maynard, every hour, every day,
I keep my feet with the greatest difficulty,

656
00:56:05,804 --> 00:56:10,851
and the slightest gust of dishonesty
would be enough to bowl me over forever.

657
00:56:10,893 --> 00:56:13,187
<i>That's why people think I'm so strange.</i>

658
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:17,014
I don't know what to say to you.

659
00:56:18,067 --> 00:56:21,320
You're suffering from
a terminal case of moral integrity.

660
00:56:21,362 --> 00:56:26,659
<i>If you'd just allow yourself to be a little
more sinful, you'd stand a chance of salvation.</i>

661
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:30,788
Salvation is the only thing that concerns me.

662
00:56:30,829 --> 00:56:34,249
<i>And I know we're not here to have a good time.</i>

663
00:56:35,793 --> 00:56:38,285
Spoken like a true Protestant.

664
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:46,501
Ludwig, my dear, there's nothing in the world
like the warmth of a sated body.

665
00:56:47,596 --> 00:56:52,559
For me, it's as if I'm being burnt
by a freezing wind.

666
00:56:54,686 --> 00:56:56,761
Pull yourself together.

667
00:57:07,074 --> 00:57:10,358
<i>Philosophy is a sickness of the mind.</i>

668
00:57:12,371 --> 00:57:16,041
<i>I mustn't infect too many young men.</i>

669
00:57:18,126 --> 00:57:21,328
<i>How unique and irreplaceable Johnny is.</i>

670
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:25,425
<i>And yet, how little I realise this
when I am with him.</i>

671
00:57:28,387 --> 00:57:30,462
<i>That's always been a problem.</i>

672
00:57:32,516 --> 00:57:35,852
<i>But living in a world where such a love is illegal,</i>

673
00:57:35,894 --> 00:57:40,190
<i>and trying to live open and honest
is a complete contradiction.</i>

674
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:49,356
<i>I have...known...Johnny three times.</i>

675
00:57:50,409 --> 00:57:55,153
<i>And each time I began with feeling
that there was nothing wrong.</i>

676
00:57:56,665 --> 00:57:58,740
<i>But after,</i>

677
00:57:59,835 --> 00:58:01,910
<i>I felt shamed.</i>

678
00:58:11,096 --> 00:58:13,171
JOHNNY: What are you thinking?

679
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:17,018
Oh, just some...

680
00:58:18,103 --> 00:58:20,178
...idea.

681
00:58:21,273 --> 00:58:23,150
What idea?

682
00:58:24,192 --> 00:58:28,520
Well, for many years at the centre of philosophy

683
00:58:28,572 --> 00:58:35,620
was a picture of the lonely human soul
brooding over its private experiences.

684
00:58:35,662 --> 00:58:37,737
Yeah, everyone knows that.

685
00:58:40,292 --> 00:58:43,628
This soul is a prisoner of his own body,

686
00:58:44,713 --> 00:58:50,385
and he's locked out from contact with others
by the walls of their bodies.

687
00:58:53,638 --> 00:58:55,713
I wanted to get rid of this picture.

688
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,343
There is no private meaning.

689
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:05,775
We are what we are... only because...

690
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:10,061
...we share a common language
and common forms of life.

691
00:59:14,492 --> 00:59:16,651
Do you understand what I'm saying?

692
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,956
Do you understand what I'm saying?

693
01:00:11,216 --> 01:00:12,873
(Like a toff) Yes.

694
01:00:12,926 --> 01:00:15,929
Yes, I'd like that very much. Yes, Wednesday.

695
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:18,045
Oh, does that suit you?

696
01:00:18,097 --> 01:00:20,172
It suits me fine, yes.

697
01:00:20,225 --> 01:00:22,852
Yes. I thought so, yes.

698
01:00:22,894 --> 01:00:24,969
Yes, he was. Really?

699
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:28,274
Oh, Bertie? Yes, I know, yes, yes.

700
01:00:28,316 --> 01:00:30,391
For many years, yes.

701
01:00:30,443 --> 01:00:32,518
(Normal voice) Christ!

702
01:00:33,738 --> 01:00:39,494
<i>Professor, you once said the Tractatus
had solved all the problems of philosophy.</i>

703
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:41,610
Yes.

704
01:00:41,663 --> 01:00:43,738
So I thought at the time.

705
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:48,503
What I meant was that I tried to show
the sort of things that philosophy could say,

706
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,922
and these aren't really important.

707
01:00:50,964 --> 01:00:55,624
What's much more important
is all the things it can't articulate.

708
01:00:55,677 --> 01:00:58,554
Doesn't cut the mustard, philosophy?

709
01:00:58,596 --> 01:01:01,057
<i>- You think.
- That's right.</i>

710
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:05,593
So I thought at the time.
In fact, I still think so, but for different reasons.

711
01:01:05,645 --> 01:01:10,556
<i>Now, talking about your more recent work,
the Philosophical Investigations and so on.</i>

712
01:01:10,608 --> 01:01:16,155
That's right. In this later work I abandoned
the idea that language is a sort of picture.

713
01:01:16,197 --> 01:01:18,950
That's just a misleading metaphor.

714
01:01:18,991 --> 01:01:24,455
<i>I mean, you might say that the word "handbag"
is a picture of a handbag.</i>

715
01:01:24,497 --> 01:01:27,458
But what about words like "hello",

716
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,575
"perhaps", "oh, hell",

717
01:01:29,627 --> 01:01:32,661
what do they give us a picture of?

718
01:01:32,713 --> 01:01:38,886
So how would you now define the relationship
between language and the world?

719
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:41,253
<i>Oh, in lots of different ways.</i>

720
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:46,800
My mistake had been to think that
there was only one way of talking at stake here.

721
01:01:46,853 --> 01:01:51,107
I came to see that there are
lots of different things we do with language.

722
01:01:51,148 --> 01:01:54,068
<i>Different language games, as I call them.</i>

723
01:01:54,986 --> 01:02:01,409
And the meaning of the word is just the way
it's used in a particular language game.

724
01:02:02,493 --> 01:02:06,247
And what do you now believe
the task of philosophy to be?

725
01:02:07,331 --> 01:02:12,576
Philosophical puzzles arise because we tend
to mix up one language game with another.

726
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:17,008
For example, people puzzle over
the nature of something they call the "soul".

727
01:02:17,049 --> 01:02:22,555
But this may just be because they're thinking
of the soul along the lines of a physical object.

728
01:02:23,681 --> 01:02:28,310
They're confusing
one way of talking with another.

729
01:02:28,352 --> 01:02:31,939
The job of philosophy
is to sort out these language games?

730
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,858
Exactly.

731
01:02:33,899 --> 01:02:36,391
They're all perfectly in order as they are.

732
01:02:36,444 --> 01:02:38,852
Philosophy in no sense can question them.

733
01:02:38,904 --> 01:02:42,439
Philosophy leaves everything exactly as it is.

734
01:02:43,534 --> 01:02:47,152
Professor Wittgenstein,
you've been associated with the argument

735
01:02:47,204 --> 01:02:49,446
that there can't be a private language.

736
01:02:49,498 --> 01:02:51,573
<i>Could you explain this a little?</i>

737
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:53,700
What I mean is this,

738
01:02:54,795 --> 01:02:59,842
we learn to use words,
because we belong to a culture.

739
01:02:59,884 --> 01:03:01,959
A form of life.

740
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:04,638
A practical way of doing things.

741
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:09,727
In the end, we speak as we do,
because of what we do.

742
01:03:10,811 --> 01:03:13,772
And all this is a properly public affair.

743
01:03:13,814 --> 01:03:17,067
<i>Philosophers in the tradition of Descartes</i>

744
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:22,531
start from the lonely self,
brooding over its private sensations.

745
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:28,037
I want to overturn this centuries-old model.

746
01:03:28,078 --> 01:03:31,113
<i>I want to start from our culture,</i>

747
01:03:31,165 --> 01:03:33,959
<i>our shared practical life together,</i>

748
01:03:34,001 --> 01:03:38,380
and look at what we think and feel,

749
01:03:38,422 --> 01:03:42,749
and say it in these public terms.

750
01:03:42,801 --> 01:03:44,876
<i>Professor, thank you very much.</i>

751
01:03:50,601 --> 01:03:52,478
I'm thinking of going away.

752
01:03:52,519 --> 01:03:55,856
Not again, Ludwig.
You've spent your entire life running away.

753
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:57,973
I'm serious, Maynard.

754
01:03:58,025 --> 01:04:00,100
Where to this time?

755
01:04:00,152 --> 01:04:02,227
Norway? Vienna?

756
01:04:02,279 --> 01:04:04,354
Swansea?

757
01:04:04,406 --> 01:04:06,481
Not the Soviet Union again?

758
01:04:06,533 --> 01:04:08,608
What's wrong with the Soviet Union?

759
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:10,871
The place is one enormous labour camp.

760
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:12,988
There's nothing wrong with labour.

761
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,448
There is if they shoot you for not doing it.

762
01:04:20,005 --> 01:04:24,583
I want to give up teaching philosophy
and concentrate on my book.

763
01:04:25,677 --> 01:04:28,795
Why not do it in Cambridge, and be paid?

764
01:04:30,432 --> 01:04:33,769
I'm going to Ireland to live by the sea.

765
01:04:33,811 --> 01:04:35,969
In Ireland they shoot you if you work.

766
01:04:40,234 --> 01:04:42,309
Oh, Ludwig.

767
01:04:43,362 --> 01:04:45,239
I know,

768
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,574
I'm a complete bloody disaster.

769
01:04:48,617 --> 01:04:50,692
We love you.

770
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:00,285
(Waves lap gently)

771
01:05:08,178 --> 01:05:10,253
Dr Wittgenstein.

772
01:05:10,305 --> 01:05:13,016
Oh, you're here. Good.

773
01:05:13,058 --> 01:05:15,133
At last.

774
01:05:15,185 --> 01:05:17,813
You couldn't have chosen a more remote place.

775
01:05:19,231 --> 01:05:21,306
Well, how's the work on your book?

776
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:23,433
Creeping along.

777
01:05:23,485 --> 01:05:25,862
That means you've penned a masterpiece.

778
01:05:27,572 --> 01:05:29,647
What's the news from the doctor?

779
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:33,370
- It's not good, I'm afraid.
- I hope it's not anything serious.

780
01:05:33,412 --> 01:05:35,622
Last week I saw a specialist in Dublin.

781
01:05:36,707 --> 01:05:38,948
I have cancer of the prostate.

782
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,075
Oh, I'm sorry.

783
01:05:42,129 --> 01:05:47,092
It responds well to hormone treatment
at early stages.

784
01:05:47,134 --> 01:05:49,209
Is there anything I can do?

785
01:05:49,261 --> 01:05:51,336
Don't think I'm afraid of dying.

786
01:05:52,389 --> 01:05:55,976
It's death that gives life its meaning and shape.

787
01:05:58,311 --> 01:06:00,386
You can take me back to Cambridge.

788
01:06:00,438 --> 01:06:02,513
I don't want to die here.

789
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:07,185
Any time you like.

790
01:06:51,197 --> 01:06:53,272
You know,

791
01:06:53,325 --> 01:07:00,290
I'd quite like to have composed a philosophical
work which consisted entirely of jokes.

792
01:07:01,374 --> 01:07:03,449
Why didn't you?

793
01:07:04,502 --> 01:07:06,713
Sadly, I didn't have a sense of humour.

794
01:07:09,215 --> 01:07:11,290
<i>Let me tell you a little story.</i>

795
01:07:13,386 --> 01:07:17,682
<i>There was once a young man who dreamed
of reducing the world to pure logic.</i>

796
01:07:18,767 --> 01:07:22,718
Because he was a very clever young man,
he actually managed to do it.

797
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:25,565
When he'd finished his work,
he stood back and admired it.

798
01:07:25,607 --> 01:07:27,682
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

799
01:07:27,734 --> 01:07:30,768
<i>A world purged
of imperfection and indeterminacy.</i>

800
01:07:31,863 --> 01:07:35,398
<i>Countless acres of gleaming ice
stretching to the horizon.</i>

801
01:07:36,743 --> 01:07:41,873
<i>So the clever young man looked around the
world he'd created and decided to explore it.</i>

802
01:07:41,915 --> 01:07:44,834
He took one step forward
and fell flat on his back.

803
01:07:44,876 --> 01:07:47,253
You see, he'd forgotten about friction.

804
01:07:47,295 --> 01:07:50,746
The ice was smooth and level and stainless.

805
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:52,873
But you couldn't walk there.

806
01:07:53,635 --> 01:07:58,348
<i>So the clever young man sat down
and wept bitter tears.</i>

807
01:07:59,641 --> 01:08:02,675
<i>But as he grew into a wise old man,</i>

808
01:08:02,727 --> 01:08:06,981
<i>he came to understand that
roughness and ambiguity aren't imperfections,</i>

809
01:08:07,023 --> 01:08:09,098
<i>they're what make the world turn.</i>

810
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:11,225
<i>He wanted to run and dance.</i>

811
01:08:12,528 --> 01:08:15,531
<i>And the words
and things scattered upon the ground</i>

812
01:08:15,573 --> 01:08:18,409
<i>were all battered
and tarnished and ambiguous.</i>

813
01:08:18,451 --> 01:08:23,247
The wise old man
saw that that was the way things were.

814
01:08:24,749 --> 01:08:29,712
But something in him
was still homesick for the ice,

815
01:08:29,754 --> 01:08:35,176
<i>where everything was radiant and absolute
and relentless.</i>

816
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:39,295
<i>Though he had come to like
the idea of the rough ground,</i>

817
01:08:39,347 --> 01:08:41,641
<i>he couldn't bring himself to live there.</i>

818
01:08:42,725 --> 01:08:48,512
<i>So now he was marooned
between earth and ice, at home in neither.</i>

819
01:08:50,733 --> 01:08:53,934
<i>And this was the cause of all his grief.</i>

Concerning the philosopher

The solution to the riddle of life
in space and time

825
01:09:26,227 --> 01:09:29,428
lies outside space and time.

But as you know and I know,
there are no riddles.
