1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,924
LOVELESS

2
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,333
Guys, wait for me!

3
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,109
Okay, see you.

4
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,990
People are here
to look at the apartment. Tidy up.

5
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,325
Good evening. Come in.

6
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,374
- I'll get out the shoe covers.
- Don't worry about it.

7
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,681
It's a nice neighborhood, with clean air.

8
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,390
We'll soon have a subway station,
and there's a shopping center nearby.

9
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,938
- They just built a church over there.
- That's nice.

10
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,228
- How are the neighbors?
- Quiet.

11
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,112
- Why sell?
- We're divorcing.

12
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,490
- Sorry to hear that.
- No worries.

13
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,698
- What's down here?
- The bathroom.

14
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,864
And toilet.

15
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,084
- And this?
- The bedroom.

16
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,595
- How many square meters?
- Eighteen.

17
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,149
- And this?
- The living room.

18
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,863
- How many square meters?
- Twenty-five.

19
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,908
- Twenty-five?
- That's right.

20
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,087
What's next?

21
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,876
Here's the kid's room.

22
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,846
- Say "hello!"
- Hello.

23
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,927
Twelve years old, and still no manners.

24
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,808
- Relax. The man's growing.
- Yeah, some man.

25
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,139
Constantly crying.

26
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,975
- Mom!
- Don't start whining.

27
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,105
Remind me
how many square meters total.

28
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:57,323
- Eighty-five-point-four square meters.
- I see.

29
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,895
Hi.

30
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,688
Relaxing?

31
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,861
What do you care?

32
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,658
I don't.

33
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,202
So did they come today?

34
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,871
They said they'd think about it.

35
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,954
I see.

36
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,253
And have you thought about it?

37
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,925
About what?

38
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,139
You know what?

39
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,804
You're the mother.

40
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,275
I'm so sick of you.

41
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,483
He needs his mother more.

42
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,737
At his age, he needs his father more.

43
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,448
Although maybe not one like you.

44
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,738
He likes summer camp.

45
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,578
He'll like boarding school too.

46
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,999
And after that, the army.
Let him get used to it.

47
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,042
What did you expect? Same as always?

48
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:40,213
You fuck everything up,
and I clean up the mess?

49
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,508
No, it won't be like that.
I'm moving on too.

50
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,393
- Heard of equal rights?
- They'll pester us.

51
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,555
Who will? You're one to talk.

52
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:54,227
Social workers, I don't know.
Child psychologists...

53
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,111
Fucking ombudsmen.

54
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,648
So you take him, and don't sweat it.

55
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,527
You'll have it worse. You're the mother.

56
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,697
Oh, so you're concerned about me?

57
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,536
Thanks a bunch.

58
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,081
Social workers...

59
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,918
...they'll be overjoyed.

60
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,630
Rescuing a babe from a house fire.

61
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,420
No matter,
the house and family burned to ash.

62
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,464
A triumph for the ombudsman.

63
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,347
Should we talk to your mother again?

64
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,684
Go talk to your own, at a séance.

65
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,853
I'm done talking to mine, thanks.

66
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,567
Not to mention, Beardy will find out.

67
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,903
So that's what this is about.

68
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,945
And like an idiot, I thought
you were worried about the kid.

69
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,284
Hey, wouldn't it be fun
if you got booted from your precious job?

70
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,999
For sending your kid to an orphanage.

71
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,880
Not so Christian, huh?

72
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,133
Beardy won't approve.

73
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,965
Then what? That would be a laugh.

74
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,050
- Enough.
- Oh, gosh.

75
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,840
Aren't you tough?

76
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,009
What?

77
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,723
What are you looking at?

78
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,851
Yeah, grit those teeth.

79
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,775
- I've fucking had it with you.
- Scumbag.

80
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,818
- When will we tell him?
- We? Who's this "we"?

81
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,405
You'll tell him!

82
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,990
Anytime you want.

83
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,076
Why not wake him up now?

84
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,458
Go on. Off you go.

85
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,035
Scumbag!

86
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,198
Not another word about this.

87
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,494
Not another word, period.
Just seeing you makes me sick.

88
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,289
Move out already! I can't stand this.

89
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,176
If you're being cheap,
I can pay for your shit to be removed.

90
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,253
Fuck off already!

91
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,799
- You're a waste of space!
- This is my home too!

92
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:33,219
It's half your home. You'll get your share!

93
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,900
Damnit.

94
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,778
Fuck's sake.

95
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,198
Piece of shit.

96
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,551
I don't want any more.

97
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,392
Finish it. Am I supposed to throw it away?

98
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,684
I don't want any more.

99
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,438
Drink your hot chocolate.

100
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,900
What's up with you? Are you sick?

101
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,410
I'm fine.

102
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,702
Okay, leave it. I'll clean up.

103
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,415
- How about a "thank you"?
- Thank you.

104
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:29,793
<i>The governor and press committee
are under pressure:</i>

105
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:34,506
<i>"To take steps to counteract the media's
incitement of public hysteria."</i>

106
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,046
<i>And here comes the best part:</i>

107
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:43,094
<i>"To consider legislation to restrict
the spread of apocalyptic propaganda."</i>

108
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,480
<i>According to the 9th-century
Mayan calendar...</i>

<i>...the end of the world,

119
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,895
Excuse me.

120
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,402
Fifth floor, please.

121
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,782
Thanks.

122
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,165
Hi.

123
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,430
Hi.

124
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,802
Hey.

125
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,140
Hi.

126
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,155
Hi.

127
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,003
- Here's your borscht.
- Thanks.

128
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,753
I'll have the same.

129
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,589
Thanks.

130
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,647
Bon appétit.

131
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,312
- Hello.
- Hello.

132
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,572
Two hundred and fifteen rubles, please.

133
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:55,456
Hey, if an employee's
marital status changes...

134
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,586
...do they find out at the top?

135
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,922
Sooner or later.

136
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:04,879
It would come up at some
team-building exercise or office party.

137
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,719
Everyone's expected
to have family and kids.

138
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:12,136
- Why do you ask?
- Just curious.

139
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:18,191
In all the time I've been here,
I don't remember a single divorce.

140
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,561
Well, that's our corporate policy.

141
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,650
As you well know.

142
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:31,118
People only part due to natural causes,
like death and stuff like that.

143
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,038
And what, nobody has ever divorced?

144
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,706
At the company's last New Year party...

145
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:46,966
...one of the programmers brought
a bogus wife with two daughters.

146
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,220
No way.

147
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,507
He had divorced his actual wife.

148
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,227
So that's how he saved his hide.

149
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,724
No idea where he found them, though.

150
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,063
Maybe he hired them.

151
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,479
Seems like he got away with it.

152
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,193
He's still here.

153
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,780
- Or maybe he remarried.
- I see.

154
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:12,947
So if you divorce and remarry quick,
maybe nobody would notice.

155
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:17,083
- If you have no close friends here.
- I don't.

156
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,412
- Then it's nobody's business.
- Right.

157
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,507
How do you know this programmer?

158
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,759
First of all...

159
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,977
...he's not a programmer.

160
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,600
I said that to protect him.

161
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,563
He's from a different department.
Don't ask me which one.

162
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,815
Secondly...

163
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,740
...I heard it from him directly.

164
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,527
You understand.

165
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,616
Actually, we haven't talked for a while.
Too busy.

166
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,704
Just greet each other from afar.

167
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,123
But this stays between us, okay?

168
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,051
But of course. Like confession.

169
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,904
Do you think the world is about to end?

170
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,864
Definitely.

171
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,372
Can you help out with work?

172
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,204
Got any leads?

173
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,245
The Lord taught us to share.

174
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,790
I may have some by the end of the day.

175
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,126
You know I'll make it worth your while.

176
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,383
- He's a nervous wreck.
- Good.

177
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,100
- He's suffering, poor thing.
- They mess up, but don't clean up.

178
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,562
And is he worried about his son?
Yeah, right.

179
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,316
He has loans.
Now he's scared of being sacked.

180
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:12,400
His boss is a hardcore Christian,
you see.

181
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,283
A fundamentalist?

182
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,036
With a big bushy beard and Brioni suit.

183
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,823
- A glamorous type.
- I'll say.

184
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,287
It's Russian Orthodox Sharia Law there.

185
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,000
They only hire family people
who have been baptized.

186
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,415
We went on a pilgrimage
for our vacation.

187
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:32,131
Yeah, I remember.
Sounds kind of fun. Exotic.

188
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,216
I was bored to death.

189
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,178
- Straighten your leg.
- It pays well, though.

190
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:40,310
Now I see he's properly scared.

191
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:44,769
- They'd seriously fire him?
- Hell if I know. I hope so.

192
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:47,059
What about child support?

193
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,817
What the hell?

194
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,695
Almost done. Relax.

195
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:54,824
A friend of mine told me
that her boss is into extreme sports.

196
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,110
- For real?
- Yes.

197
00:24:56,286 --> 00:25:00,451
So he makes his staff go skydiving,
rafting, skiing...

198
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,537
- Skiing is fun.
- I don't know about that.

199
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:07,671
My friend broke her kneecap
and spent half a year in a cast.

200
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,832
- Goodbye, tendons.
- Damn.

201
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:14,299
Some of them bought fake doctor's notes
online to get out of it.

202
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,507
And?

203
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,674
He fired them, saying,
"If you're ill, go to hospital."

204
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,183
Crazy.

205
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:25,188
So prayers and pilgrimages
aren't so bad. Turn over.

206
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,768
Well, I don't know.

207
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:31,403
A vacation should be sun and sea...

208
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,279
...at an all-inclusive hotel.

209
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:38,785
- And what does your new guy think?
- He's fine with it all.

210
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,695
He's pretty forward-thinking.

211
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:44,116
Well, he's got money and his health.

212
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,706
- Why not move forward?
- Knock on wood.

213
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,087
Don't worry, I won't jinx you.

214
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,339
No, I'm not superstitious.

215
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,249
Is he divorced? Any kids?

216
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,340
Divorced three years ago.
Has a grown-up daughter.

217
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,472
She's studying in Portugal.
Works there too.

218
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,054
- How old is he?
- Forty-seven.

219
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,014
He looks great.

220
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:08,228
He does tai chi, doesn't smoke
and barely drinks.

221
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,107
I'm jealous.

222
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,440
- You want it trimmed a bit?
- Yes, a little bit.

223
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,534
- How does he get on with your boy?
- He doesn't.

224
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:23,663
I think that boy hates me.
Just like his father.

225
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,245
He's even beginning to smell like him.

226
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:30,708
Sure, he's hitting puberty.
Want him to stay your little angel?

227
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:34,340
He only looks like an angel.
He's prickly as hell.

228
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,594
Almost tore me apart at birth.
He wouldn't come out.

229
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,050
Took almost 24 hours.

230
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,179
Yeah, such is our lot.

231
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,349
My little cow.

232
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:51,312
I look at her, and sad to say,
she's just like her dad.

233
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,647
I hope he's drunk himself to death.

234
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,062
Look.

235
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:03,407
She doesn't drink, fortunately.
I told her I'd kill her if she did.

236
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,196
It's her temperament.

237
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,367
It's not even his,
but his bitch of a mother's.

238
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:12,629
- How old is your daughter again?
- Nineteen. And a total idiot.

239
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,711
I mean, she's smart-assed
her school exams.

240
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,843
And that's it. She's done with learning.

241
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,844
Just off cavorting somewhere.

242
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,758
I tell her, "If you get pregnant,
your life's over. I won't help."

243
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:28,303
- She says she's careful.
- Well, that's something.

244
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:33,684
She just has no plan at all.
No vocation, no ambition.

245
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,274
She says she wants to be a politician.

246
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,154
I tell her, "Then study while you can."

247
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,032
She says you don't need to study for that.

248
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:46,116
- She's smart, your girl.
- She gets that from me.

249
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:04,180
- Yes?
<i>- Zhenya, can you come down?</i>

250
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,198
Why won't you tell me anything?

251
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,707
Meaning?

252
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,204
Did the buyers like the apartment?

253
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,463
They said they'd think about it.

254
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:42,089
Masha, if there were any news,
I'd tell you right away.

255
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:47,057
Why is it taking so long to sell?
You work in sales after all.

256
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,473
You understand, it's not the same thing.

257
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,604
No, I don't understand.

258
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:57,358
Leave the dumplings.
Mom said no dumplings.

259
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,898
Is she home today?

260
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:05,693
No, she went to see my aunt.
I'm a little tired of her too.

261
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,203
- We have the place to ourselves.
- Thank God.

262
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:12,241
Don't say that. She's my mom.

263
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,534
Grab some broccoli.

264
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,859
Boris.

265
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,457
Wait.

266
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,137
We'll be fine, won't we?

267
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,930
You won't leave us?

268
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,228
What?

269
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,431
Masha.

270
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,315
Are you crazy?
Where's this coming from?

271
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:55,235
I just get so scared sometimes.

272
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,536
Hey, I'm here.

273
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,500
I bet that's what you told your ex-wife.

274
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,126
With you, it's totally different.

275
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,922
I've never felt this good with anyone.

276
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,636
How many others have there been?

277
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,231
More than 10?

278
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,939
I'm hungry. You?

279
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,937
Now I'm hungry all the time.

280
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:39,571
- I'm a little mad at you.
- I'll make something to eat.

281
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,621
Bring me an apple.

282
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,961
Catch.

283
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,132
Steamed chicken with broccoli?

284
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,017
I don't want that.

285
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:10,269
- I want a vegetable salad.
- And a vegetable salad too.

286
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,032
Dream of having a tooth pulled out.
What does it mean?

287
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,972
- Hi.
- Hi.

288
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,849
You're early.

289
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,936
I expected you later. I barely got away.

290
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:53,315
The girls didn't want to let me go.
The salon is packed today.

291
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,272
Where are we going?

292
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,274
Why so quiet? Tell me your plan!

293
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,823
Hey, let's buy a watermelon on the way.

294
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,379
Hey.

295
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:23,296
I'd love to get your number.
Eight, nine hundred...?

296
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:28,844
Twenty-five, 160, 78, 88.

297
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,137
- What's your name?
- Sofia.

298
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,986
I can't eat when you look at me that way.

299
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,488
Sorry.

300
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,363
Just kidding.

301
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,868
Did you cut your hair?

302
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,454
- You noticed?
- Of course.

303
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,835
I love studying you.

304
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,712
Still?

305
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,962
After all that we've been through?

306
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,883
Especially after that.

307
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,100
After what happened two days ago?

308
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,722
Or three days ago?

309
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,599
Zhenya...

310
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,651
What?

311
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,937
What is it?

312
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,693
Anything wrong?

313
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,038
Right, girls, let's drink to love!

314
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,293
To love!

315
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,250
Love? Please!

316
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,664
Let's take a selfie.

317
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,800
- Sure!
- Here's to love and selfies.

318
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,841
Hey.

319
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:28,984
Are you asleep?

320
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:40,787
Not fair.

321
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,468
I love you.

322
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,138
You hear me?

323
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,852
I've never loved anyone.

324
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,615
Only my mom when I was little.

325
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,243
And she was such an idiot.

326
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:25,533
Never cuddled me,
never said anything nice.

327
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,747
Nothing but rules, discipline, school...

328
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,922
Just a bitter and lonely old battle-ax.

329
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,462
I hope she's alive and well?

330
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,131
Yes, she's alive...

331
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,768
...and basically well.

332
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,312
We don't talk much.

333
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:55,070
Every time I call, we fight.

334
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,609
I never even know how it gets started.

335
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,759
It's with you
that I finally realized what love is.

336
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,259
I never loved my husband.

337
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,431
He was my first.

338
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,852
I got pregnant out of stupidity.

339
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,945
He was overjoyed.
Asked me to marry him.

340
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,952
It all seemed fine. We were together.

341
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,330
But I didn't want it.

342
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,165
I was so scared.

343
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,714
Scared of getting an abortion,
and scared of keeping it.

344
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,465
I really didn't want that child.

345
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:15,567
I thought I'd die giving birth.
They had to resuscitate me.

346
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,734
Later, when they brought him to me...

347
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,071
...I was barely able to look at him.

348
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,411
I was repulsed.

349
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,747
I wasn't even producing milk.

350
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:49,636
But things gradually settled.
A kind of normal life began.

351
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,679
A kind of...

352
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,265
Lovelessness.

353
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,311
You cannot live in that state.

354
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:17,212
To this day, when I see him,
or think of how things are...

355
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:22,167
...I feel like I made some terrible mistake.

356
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,015
I blame him, and I blame myself.

357
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,144
I so want to be happy.

358
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,064
I'm a monster, aren't I?

359
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,653
Certainly.

360
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:54,165
The most wonderful monster in the world.

361
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,546
Do you really love me?

362
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,007
Come to me.

363
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:19,575
Just a second.

364
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,433
Hello?

365
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:50,728
<i>Did you see Alexey last night?</i>

366
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,488
No, I wasn't at the apartment. Why?

367
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:57,321
The school just called.
He hasn't been there for two days.

368
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,202
<i>What do you mean?</i>

369
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,657
<i>Who called?</i>

370
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,242
His teacher.

371
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,663
<i>His teacher? And what did she say?</i>

372
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:09,580
That he's not been there in two days.
Are you deaf?

373
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:12,295
<i>- Did he come home?</i>
- I don't know.

374
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,712
I came back late. I thought he was in bed.

375
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:20,508
I woke up late,
thinking he had already left, as usual.

376
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,176
He won't answer his phone.
Did he call you?

377
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,720
<i>No.</i>

378
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,472
Oh, Lord...

379
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:30,518
<i>Don't panic. He'll turn up.</i>

380
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,562
<i>We should call that friend of his.</i>

381
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,482
I already did. He hasn't seen him either.

382
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,026
Okay.

383
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:44,039
- Where are you now?
<i>- At home.</i>

384
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,871
You can't fucking tell if he's been there?

385
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,535
No, I fucking can't!

386
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,204
<i>Why not? It should be obvious.</i>

387
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:54,341
Then get over here, and work it out!

388
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:58,170
I'm at work, in case you forgot.

389
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:02,136
<i>He's missing for over a day.
Don't you get it?</i>

390
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:06,265
He may be on his way home
as we speak.

391
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,431
I think you're overreacting.

392
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:13,227
He probably did something,
and thinks you'll get mad...

393
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,145
...so is staying away.

394
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,781
<i>So it's my fault again, right?</i>

395
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,783
You don't even know
whether he was home recently.

396
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,041
And he probably was.

397
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,128
<i>Hello?</i>

398
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:36,959
<i>Hello?</i>

399
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,257
Here's what I'll do.

400
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,296
I'm calling the police.

401
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:46,177
You can sit at work, speculating
on what may have happened, got it?

402
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,719
Useless idiot!

403
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:19,835
So, Dasha,
one office worker asks another:

404
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:21,844
"What kind of car do you drive?"

405
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,346
"A Volkswagen Passat."

406
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,632
"Well, I have a Volkswagen Credit."

407
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,225
Hilarious.

408
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:33,224
- Hey, so one office worker...
- Yes, Sergey, I heard you.

409
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,693
It's funny.

410
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,264
I'm done.

411
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,273
Okay, thanks.

412
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,309
Take this.

413
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:24,361
Wait for me in the car.
We'll try one more place.

414
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:25,821
Okay.

415
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,489
Well, I can say
that there's no hint of foul play.

416
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,532
What do you mean, "foul play"?

417
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,201
You know how it is.

418
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:38,213
The parents kill the child,
and then report him missing.

419
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,586
You thought that about me?

420
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:45,174
We always check that angle first.
But this looks like a standard runaway.

421
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:48,215
He's 12.
A rebellious age, lots of hormones.

422
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:51,430
He'll run around for a few days
and come back.

423
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:56,314
Of course, we can go to the station
and spend a few hours questioning you.

424
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,770
But not today, I guess.

425
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:02,358
Not least because
your husband should be there too.

426
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:07,196
But I don't think it will come to that.

427
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,957
You say there's no foul play.

428
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:16,584
But what if he's been kidnapped?

429
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,622
Because I can't imagine
where he might be.

430
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,381
I'm sure he's knocking around nearby.

431
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,258
He won't stay away long.

432
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:27,592
We all enjoy comfort,
and your home has that.

433
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,724
You should see the dumps kids return to.

434
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:34,182
Even the shittiest home beats the streets.

435
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:37,973
As for possible kidnapping,
it goes like this:

436
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,142
First, we examine the situation.

437
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:45,485
This includes questioning relatives,
friends and possible eyewitnesses.

438
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,821
We have limited resources
and many other matters.

439
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:52,578
Theft, murder, armed robbery...

440
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,828
So that stage may take a few days.

441
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,744
If the kid hasn't come back by then...

442
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:00,878
...we start searching for him.

443
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:07,010
If we obtain evidence indicating
possible murder or kidnapping...

444
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:11,890
...then we open a criminal case
for the Investigation Committee.

445
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:15,177
So you see how long
this process may take.

446
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:17,141
The paperwork alone...

447
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,273
In that time, they can return
and run away again.

448
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,525
So you won't do anything?

449
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:25,357
Now, look, I'm just telling you how it is.

450
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,231
We'll handle this case.

451
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:33,028
But here, we lack the means
of chasing each runaway.

452
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:34,662
I get it.

453
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,247
This will just be filed away.

454
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,252
What am I supposed to do?
Sit around and wait?

455
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:45,005
- What if he doesn't return?
- The stats are on your side.

456
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:51,263
In virtually all cases, runaways come
back within seven to 10 days.

457
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,382
What can I recommend?

458
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,974
If you really want someone
to look for him, go online...

459
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:01,389
...and contact
the Search and Rescue Team.

460
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:05,811
Call them, and they'll tell you
what info they need.

461
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:09,026
They're volunteers.
It's not a state service.

462
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:14,240
They work 24 hours, for free,
with no bureaucracy.

463
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:17,747
They have well-developed
and highly effective methods.

464
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:21,830
I know this because I worked with them,
and we got results.

465
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:25,584
Right, here's my card.

466
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:31,549
I already have your number.
We'll be in touch.

467
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,260
- That's it?
- For now, yes.

468
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:38,639
- Unbelievable.
- Now listen here.

469
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:43,682
Another cop would have been tougher
with you and less informative.

470
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:49,150
Not because I'm such a good guy.
I'm just saving everyone time.

471
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:53,738
The sooner you contact the volunteers,
the sooner they'll find that dolt...

472
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:57,120
...who's loitering in some street
or shopping mall.

473
00:56:57,289 --> 00:57:02,956
He's probably with a friend
whose parents left town for a bit.

474
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:07,964
So contact them.
Or just wait. It's up to you.

475
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:13,504
<i>Money paid by candidates
for the opposition council was stolen.</i>

476
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,391
<i>According to the prosecutor's website,
over 600,000 rubles was taken...</i>

477
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,724
<i>...by the creators
of the Electoral Committee's website...</i>

478
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:24,514
<i>...where candidates and voters register.</i>

479
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:28,935
<i>Boris Nemtsov called it
a government provocation...</i>

480
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:32,731
<i>...planned to disrupt voting
for the opposition council.</i>

481
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:38,074
<i>New York State Police have detained
U.S. presidential candidate Jill Stein...</i>

482
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,989
<i>...and her running mate, Cheri Honkala.</i>

483
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:44,284
<i>The two were denied access
to the Obama-Romney debate...</i>

484
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:49,047
<i>...given the Green Party's position
on presidential debates...</i>

485
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,233
When did you two last speak
on the phone?

486
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,861
I took him to school, and that was it.

487
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,192
- Hello.
- Hello.

488
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,358
Sorry, traffic was bad.

489
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:19,653
Take a seat, I'll fill you in. I'm Ivan.

490
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,870
- I'm a coordinator here.
- Yes, my wife told me on the phone.

491
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,126
Great, then let's get started,
or rather, continue.

492
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:30,788
I'll tell you our plan,
to give you an overview.

493
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:33,504
I'll ask you questions about your son...

494
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:38,047
...while others will interview neighbors
and possible witnesses...

495
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,840
...at any locations
he may have been. Yes, Lena?

496
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:43,510
- Nothing from the neighbors.
- At all?

497
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:47,681
No one saw or heard him,
either yesterday or today.

498
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:50,726
- The rest of the team is here.
- Okay.

499
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:53,736
- They brought the flyers.
- Great, well-done.

500
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:56,773
- I'll keep asking around.
- Yes, carry on.

501
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,486
So...

502
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:04,490
...depending on what info we get,
we'll focus on particular sites.

503
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,079
You and I will go to the police station.

504
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:11,587
The detective there promised
to get us CCTV footage.

505
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:14,625
That's vital, and may be a huge help.

506
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:18,795
Also, it'll be dark soon.
The boy needs a place to sleep.

507
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,588
It's cold out.

508
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:23,258
We'll search for him
in apartment buildings.

509
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:27,145
Hopefully, we'll get access codes
from the detective.

510
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:30,182
Okay, let's start from the beginning.

511
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,313
"Alexey Sleptsov, 12 years old...

512
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,900
...about 150 cm tall...

513
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:39,908
...healthy, without any
distinguishing features, blond hair.

514
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:44,572
Was wearing blue jeans, red jacket
with a hood, and blue sneakers.

515
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:47,786
He had with him a blue school rucksack.

516
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:52,579
Yesterday, he left for school,
and it seems, hasn't been back since."

517
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:56,670
His phone is off, or has no signal,
but we keep calling him.

518
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,168
Onwards.

519
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:03,716
What is the boy interested in?
Any hobbies or favorite sports?

520
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:07,431
Dreams of building a spaceport
or traveling the world?

521
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,813
No, he has no hobbies
and doesn't play sports.

522
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,190
I think he just sits at home.

523
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,192
You "think"? I see.

524
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:17,445
So he's on a computer.

525
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,150
- He has a laptop?
- Yes.

526
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:22,112
- We try to limit his use.
- You, especially.

527
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:26,074
- Leave the arguing for later, okay?
- Yes, of course.

528
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:28,205
- Is his laptop accessible?
- Yes.

529
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:34,212
Access to his e-mail,
social accounts and friends' numbers?

530
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:38,045
He only has one friend:
Kuznetsov, I think.

531
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,627
Again, you "think"? Okay, fine.

532
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:46,266
I have all of his passwords.
Kuznetsov really is his only friend.

533
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,596
I mean, in real life.

534
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,181
As for online...

535
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,596
Okay, I understand.

536
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,732
Any close relatives
to whom he may have gone:

537
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,860
Grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins?

538
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,737
There's only my mother,
who lives near Moscow.

539
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,365
I doubt the squirt would go there.

540
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,822
"The squirt"? I see.

541
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:09,034
I assume you called her
to confirm he wasn't there?

542
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:12,166
Can't reach her.
We're not on great terms.

543
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,497
What do you mean by that?

544
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:18,506
Her phone has been off,
although it could be the signal.

545
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,338
The signal is fine. She's the problem.

546
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,798
So Grandma's a strong type.

547
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:26,931
- Call her neighbors?
- I don't have their numbers.

548
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:32,516
It's her home, her neighbors.
Better not to meddle there.

549
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,726
Could she be hiding Alexey?

550
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,857
Say, if he asked her to?

551
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,438
I don't think so.

552
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,649
That Stalin-in-a-skirt could do anything.

553
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,029
Enough!

554
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,986
How would he even get there?

555
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:47,823
- Maybe they were talking in secret.
- She doesn't like him.

556
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,282
Like that matters.

557
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,698
She uses him against me.

558
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:54,583
You must pay Grandma
a visit right away.

559
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:57,746
- Where exactly does she live?
- A small house.

560
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:00,666
It's off the Kiev highway. Hard to explain.

561
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,754
There's an unmarked turnoff.

562
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:04,385
- You have a car?
- Yes.

563
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:08,423
- How long is the journey?
- About three hours.

564
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,264
Okay, give me the contacts
of his friends and acquaintances...

565
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:15,225
...and his teacher's number.

566
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,606
- I hope you have it.
- We do.

567
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:22,692
Great. And all his passwords.
I'll take his laptop to be inspected.

568
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,901
Then we'll decide what to do next.

569
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:26,441
So...

570
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:29,656
Is this the teacher's number? Okay.

571
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,742
As for you, get in the car...

572
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:35,408
...and go see lovely Grandma.

573
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,248
Lena will also go.
She's highly experienced.

574
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,834
She'll follow you in her car.

575
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,966
Along the way,
keep trying to call Grandma.

576
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,843
When you're there, look carefully.

577
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,346
Then call me, whether he's there or not.

578
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:50,632
- Got it?
- Yes.

579
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:52,095
Sure?

580
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:53,680
Questions?

581
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:58,857
Someone will watch the apartment,
in case he comes back.

582
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,266
Well?

583
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,106
Right, on with the song.

584
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,127
For fuck's sake.

585
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,373
- Turn it off. I have a headache.
- We have aspirin.

586
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:27,339
Just turn it off. Please.

587
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:44,769
- Do you think he's there?
- Where else would he be?

588
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,736
What a fucking pain.

589
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:55,947
Great fucking timing.

590
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:59,959
- What if something happened?
- Let's not even go there.

591
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:03,087
He's fine.

592
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:06,958
And he's in for an ass-kicking.

593
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,211
You can't smoke here.

594
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:13,131
Pardon me. I'll smoke out of the window.

595
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:15,015
I said, don't.

596
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:19,683
Or what? You gonna leave me
on the side of the road?

597
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,018
Headache's gone, eh?

598
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,142
Roll up the windows.

599
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,813
Roll up the windows!

600
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,659
Scumbag!

601
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:38,952
Roll up the fucking windows!

602
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:04,524
<i>An encroaching Arctic front will lead
to the weather worsening.</i>

603
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:10,529
<i>Tomorrow we can expect
low temperatures and heavy snow.</i>

604
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:28,922
Damn, they put up a gate.

605
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,588
Now what do we do? Ram it?

606
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,902
- Probably barricaded herself in.
- Quit it.

607
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:39,614
- Can we enter some other way?
- Only by climbing the fence.

608
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,074
We don't have keys.

609
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,784
I see.

610
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,160
Where is she going?

611
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:04,434
Thanks.

612
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,148
Mom!

613
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:15,445
Mom, open up! It's me!

614
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,317
Mom!

615
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,574
Mom!

616
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:32,003
She's in there.

617
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:36,709
Mom, open up! Alexey has gone missing!

618
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,672
For God's sake...

619
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:43,424
Almost had a heart attack.

620
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:47,720
Calling in the middle of the night,
like there's a fire...

621
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,854
...then they climb the fence!

622
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,892
May God help me.

623
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,731
I'll go insane.

624
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,487
And I can't find my phone.

625
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,610
How am I to call for help?

626
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:07,031
- You could have warned me!
- I called enough times!

627
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,700
- Don't say you didn't hear.
- I swear!

628
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:15,123
- You switched it off.
- I told you, I probably lost it!

629
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:18,088
It's been gone all day,
but to hell with that.

630
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:22,722
Instead, my dear, tell me:
What made you think your son was here?

631
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:35,026
- He's not here and never was.
- We'll check everywhere.

632
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:57,752
Where's that damn prick of yours?

633
01:08:57,925 --> 01:08:59,507
Lord forgive me.

634
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,384
You mentioned a divorce.

635
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:04,380
You're God and the devil rolled into one.

636
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,638
What?

637
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,549
What's that supposed to mean?

638
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:12,142
Huh, what are you saying?

639
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,849
Have you totally lost it?

640
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:16,934
Think you're so clever?

641
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:20,980
Don't look away from your mother.
Have some respect!

642
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,945
If you don't like it,
get out, and good riddance.

643
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,780
I didn't invite you!

644
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:27,782
What a mess.

645
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,412
You were a mistake.

646
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,244
Look what you've become.

647
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,409
- What?
- A whore is what!

648
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,373
- Mom...
- Don't "Mom" me!

649
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:36,662
Want a tit? Here!

650
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:39,631
Whining for Mom.

651
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:49,972
You done snooping around?
Didn't find him?

652
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:52,345
You're losing it.

653
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,107
Looks like the battery's dead.

654
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,524
Of course. Where was it?

655
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:03,655
It was under your bed.

656
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:07,444
Must have fallen.
Thank God it's not lost.

657
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:09,991
How about some tea?

658
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:13,157
I don't have anything sweet
to go with it, mind you.

659
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:17,795
- That's okay, Mom. We'll go.
- Well, aren't we polite?

660
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,465
You two sure don't seem too worried.

661
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,626
Alexey is missing, you say.

662
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:27,345
I bet you made it up
to try to melt my heart.

663
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,722
Dream on.

664
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,929
I can see through your tricks.

665
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:37,682
You said you were getting divorced.
Plan to stick me with your spawn?

666
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:39,600
Never going to happen.

667
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:42,520
I'll say it again: I will not babysit him.

668
01:10:42,697 --> 01:10:44,404
Do you interact with anyone?

669
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:48,614
When you got pregnant,
I warned you to come to your senses!

670
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:51,529
Remember you told me
to go to hell? I do.

671
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:55,620
I told you that you'd crawl back to me
only when it's too late.

672
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:58,160
You made your bed, you lie in it.

673
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:00,416
Let that be a lesson to you.

674
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:03,628
Mom, why make a scene?
Someone else is also here.

675
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:06,418
Don't you lecture me.

676
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:09,213
I don't care. I'm at home, you know.

677
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,973
Trying to make a fool out of me.

678
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:15,557
Breaking in at night,
like a pair of thieves!

679
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,097
Brought along some appraiser.

680
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:21,232
Don't think I'll leave this house to you.

681
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:22,643
Not on your life!

682
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,528
I'm bequeathing everything to God!

683
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:28,441
You'll get nothing.
I only have my pension...

684
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:29,654
Let's go.

685
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:32,820
...no help from you.
Well, I don't need it!

686
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,329
Least of all from you.

687
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:35,740
Won't even bury me.

688
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,705
- Oh, we will.
- Get the fuck out!

689
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,276
Are we nearly there yet?

690
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,695
Another 40 minutes or so.

691
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,333
Her paranoia is getting worse with age.

692
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:25,960
So much hatred. It's awful.

693
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:28,546
And you're so full of love?

694
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,678
- Why are you defending her?
- Because she's right.

695
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,384
About what?

696
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,641
That you want her to drop dead?

697
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:37,676
Watch your mouth.

698
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:46,769
She warned me to ditch you,
abort the kid and not be an idiot.

699
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:50,610
And I listened to you instead.

700
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,074
"It's okay. We're together."

701
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:54,985
Well, explain this:

702
01:12:55,162 --> 01:13:00,032
How did all that talk
of love and happiness...

703
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:03,577
...lead only to pain and disappointment?

704
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,623
A miserable heap of shit.

705
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:22,387
I never loved you.

706
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:28,277
I just couldn't bear living
with her anymore.

707
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:35,530
And I couldn't find a way out.

708
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:38,867
You offered me a way out.

709
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:43,451
I used you...

710
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:45,627
...or so I thought.

711
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:47,708
But it was you who used me.

712
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:49,919
You needed a family, not me.

713
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,300
I would have been fine. Really.

714
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:00,054
I just needed to move in with someone.

715
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,514
If only I never got pregnant...

716
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,735
That really messed me up.

717
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:16,033
- I should have just aborted it.
- Yes, you should have.

718
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:20,788
- Better for everyone.
- Yeah? What's changed?

719
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:22,323
You've changed?

720
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:26,786
Getting another dumb girl pregnant
to join in your misery?

721
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:31,799
In 12 years, if you can still get it up,
you'll play the same trick on her.

722
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:36,671
That poor girl. Even I feel sorry for her.

723
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:43,894
You have ruined my life.
Do you understand?

724
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:54,939
Thank God I met a good man,
who wants nothing but me alone.

725
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:00,402
- Did we break down?
- Yeah, we broke down. Get out.

726
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,912
- I'm serious.
- So am I. Fuck off.

727
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:07,334
Get out before I throw you out.

728
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,962
- This is a new trick!
- Go fuck yourself, bitch!

729
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:14,625
Don't forget
your son is missing, scumbag!

730
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,110
Keep the line.

731
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,408
Stick together.

732
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,743
<i>Fox-1 to call out to the boy.</i>

733
01:17:56,797 --> 01:18:03,169
Alexey!

734
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,872
Fox-1, finished.

735
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:37,707
Let's go, guys.

736
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:33,633
That's all of it.

737
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:35,594
Can I see it again?

738
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:41,520
No other cameras picked him up.

739
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:45,028
Nothing by the school
or shopping mall, which they love.

740
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,530
It's fun, and it has food.

741
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,363
Nothing on the way to the bus stop.

742
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:54,997
If he were taking the subway
to get to the train station...

743
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:57,248
...there are a few possibilities.

744
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,577
Either he turned into a street
without cameras...

745
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:02,495
...of which there are many...

746
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:07,384
...or he picked a route with no cameras,
which is unlikely.

747
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:09,419
Or someone took him.

748
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:11,754
What do you mean, "took him"?

749
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,265
Kidnapped him.

750
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,306
Are you serious?

751
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:21,606
We don't joke about things like that.

752
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,934
That's impossible.

753
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:26,569
It's possible, sadly.

754
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:28,196
What do you have?

755
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:34,908
Nothing from yesterday's interviews.
Of course, it's already been a while.

756
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:38,824
It's time to file a search case.
Actually, a criminal one.

757
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:40,583
Excuse me.

758
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:45,998
We handed out flyers to paramedics,
traffic police, shopkeepers...

759
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:48,963
- Hello.
<i>- I've missed you, my love.</i>

760
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:53,346
<i>- You promised to come today.</i>
- I doubt I can. I'm needed here.

761
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,507
<i>What about me? Yourjob?</i>

762
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:58,722
<i>- You said they were strict.</i>
- I took some time off.

763
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,429
<i>Time off from me too?</i>

764
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:03,348
Don't be silly.

765
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:06,852
I'm sure you understand.

766
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:11,030
<i>I'm just so lonely. We feel so far apart.</i>

767
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,943
<i>- Will it be over soon?</i>
- Of course.

768
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:17,912
<i>- I really have to go.</i>
- Don't hang up.

769
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:21,371
Let me listen to what's happening.

770
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:23,877
<i>Why are you being like that?</i>

771
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:26,584
<i>It would be awkward.</i>

772
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:28,548
Why?

773
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,376
Are you hiding something?

774
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:33,261
<i>Of course not.</i>

775
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:37,181
Yes, you are.

776
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:39,434
Is your ex there?

777
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:42,896
Masha, give it a rest.

778
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:45,606
I love you.

779
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:49,602
- Really?
<i>- Of course.</i>

780
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:53,152
I love you too. We love you.

781
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:54,816
<i>Okay, kisses. Gotta go.</i>

782
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:58,327
Kisses. Goodbye, can't wait to see you.

783
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:03,705
- Well, aren't you a sweet kitten?
- Mom.

784
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:06,336
Let me handle him.

785
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,630
Good Lord, by all means.

786
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,133
Of course you will.

787
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:16,638
It's just, my mom taught me,
and now it's my turn.

788
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:20,721
Men are all like little kids.

789
01:22:22,813 --> 01:22:25,351
Oh, Masha, you're my beautiful girl.

790
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:32,361
- Hey, look at this one. Like it?
- No.

791
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:34,113
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

792
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:36,525
Hi, honey.

793
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:40,366
<i>How are you doing there?</i>

794
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:42,075
We're okay.

795
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,032
It's fall.

796
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:48,207
<i>Over here it's summer. All the time.</i>

797
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,372
Coming to Moscow soon?

798
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,211
<i>Why would I go there?</i>

799
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:55,259
To see me.

800
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:58,847
<i>I can see you just fine!</i>

801
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:09,270
<i>Okay, Dad...</i>

802
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:11,275
<i>...I gotta go.</i>

803
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:12,686
<i>I have a meeting.</i>

804
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:15,988
<i>Only, don't miss me, okay?</i>

805
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:19,568
<i>Sending big kisses your way!</i>

806
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:22,362
Okay. Kisses to you too.

807
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:25,373
<i>Bye, now.</i>

808
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:22,468
Zhenya, wake up.

809
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:24,591
It's time to go.

810
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:33,767
What time is it?

811
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:40,406
I'll come with you, if you don't mind.

812
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:44,661
- Sure. Don't you have work?
- Work can wait.

813
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:46,488
Okay.

814
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:52,161
I need to call that coordinator guy.

815
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:54,670
God, it's so late. I even set the alarm.

816
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,254
I turned it off. You needed rest.

817
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:07,971
Yes?

818
01:25:08,145 --> 01:25:10,011
<i>- Ivan?</i>
- Yes.

819
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:13,932
<i>- It's Alexey's mom.</i>
- Any news?

820
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:18,069
- No. Do you have any?
<i>- Nothing so far. Working on it.</i>

821
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:21,731
- I see.
<i>- Anything else?</i>

822
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:29,323
- I got in late last night, and...
<i>- Sorry, I don't have time.</i>

823
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:33,076
Of course. What can I do?

824
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:34,414
I can't just wait.

825
01:25:34,588 --> 01:25:38,582
Get on the phone,
call all the hospitals near you.

826
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:43,129
Follow up on any boy aged 10-13,
no matter who brought him in...

827
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:48,425
...matching the description or not.

828
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:51,686
If a hospital says they have one,
let me know.

829
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:54,893
Preferably by text.
I'll send some people there.

830
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:58,231
<i>- We could go.</i>
- Great. But let me know anyway.

831
01:25:58,403 --> 01:26:02,773
A search-team member will also go.
Someone who knows what to do.

832
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:06,784
If there are a few possibilities,
we'll need several groups.

833
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:09,115
Okay, sorry, I gotta go.

834
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:33,015
- When did you see him last?
- Three days ago, I think.

835
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:36,602
On the ninth? Tuesday?

836
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:37,891
Yes.

837
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:39,354
Where?

838
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:41,360
Here, at school.

839
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:45,322
And what did you do after school?

840
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:48,318
Nothing. Everyone went home.

841
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,288
Where do you usually hang out?

842
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:56,785
- In the yard. I don't know.
- Sure, and where else?

843
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:58,999
Nowhere else.

844
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:00,754
Come on, now.

845
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:03,166
At the shopping mall, I bet?

846
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:05,676
No, our parents don't let us.

847
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:09,214
What, so you just sit in a sandbox,
like babies?

848
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:10,848
What? No.

849
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:13,725
We play soccer at the hockey rink.

850
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:17,229
Do you have a bike?

851
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:18,856
Yeah.

852
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:22,936
And where do you
and Alexey usually ride?

853
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:26,231
Nowhere. Just in the yard,
around buildings.

854
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:27,944
Look, kid...

855
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:32,863
...if you're not telling us where he is
because you made a pact, okay.

856
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:34,905
I get it. I really do.

857
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:38,747
As long as you're sure
that your friend is safe.

858
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,630
We adults will do the legwork.
That's okay.

859
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:45,336
It's a bit of a game, right?

860
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:47,502
Like hide-and-seek?

861
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:50,046
Seriously, I don't know where he is.

862
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:55,260
Okay, I believe you.

863
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:58,767
Where do you think he could be?

864
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:01,937
I know you have a base.

865
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:08,235
I don't know where,
but I've seen your online chat.

866
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:13,077
If you don't know where he is,
but think he may be there...

867
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:16,535
...then you must tell us where it is.

868
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:20,122
Because your friend could be in danger.

869
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:28,634
You see, kid, we'll find it sooner or later.

870
01:28:29,513 --> 01:28:32,677
But it may be too late,
and that would be bad.

871
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:35,512
Is this place more important
than your friend?

872
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:37,847
You'll find plenty of other spots.

873
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:40,638
If you made a pact,
you won't be breaking it.

874
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:44,560
You're saving your friend,
who really needs your help.

875
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,691
In the forest.

876
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:50,690
- The base is there.
- Good.

877
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:52,950
What is it? A dugout? A tent?

878
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,281
No. An abandoned building.

879
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:56,662
In the basement.

880
01:28:57,374 --> 01:28:59,707
Is it walkable? Or better to cycle over?

881
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,952
It's a bit far. Better to go by bike.

882
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:04,745
Will you show us?

883
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:11,465
You really helped us. Thank you.

884
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:14,426
Your kid did great.

885
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:17,512
- Do you have more time?
- Yes.

886
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:21,225
- Will you come and help us?
- Okay.

887
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:23,765
- Thank you. Bye.
- All the best.

888
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:53,003
- Well, shall we go?
- Yes, let's get going.

889
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:54,924
Just a second.

890
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:33,857
Over there.

891
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:13,480
It's his jacket.

892
01:32:19,826 --> 01:32:22,193
Pihto to Ivan: We found his jacket.

893
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:24,828
The father is sure it's his. Over.

894
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:26,034
<i>Understood.</i>

895
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:29,371
<i>Comb the entire complex
and surrounding area.</i>

896
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:32,628
Remember, it's dangerous
and unknown territory.

897
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:35,881
Keep us informed,
but don't go in yourselves.

898
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:38,259
We have specialists for that.

899
01:32:38,428 --> 01:32:43,298
Don't get hurt. It'll make things worse.
Any injuries, stop the search...

900
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:47,094
...and direct all efforts
to helping your buddy.

901
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:49,808
First, contact the coordinator. That's me.

902
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:52,518
Only the doctor provides
medical assistance.

903
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:53,899
That's him.

904
01:32:54,069 --> 01:32:55,731
Before he arrives...

905
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:59,068
...do not touch the runaway,
if he's unable to move.

906
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,903
Talk to him, reassure him...

907
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:03,568
...wait for the doctor.

908
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:05,236
Right, on with the song.

909
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:07,700
I mean that figuratively, by the way.

910
01:33:07,874 --> 01:33:09,661
Okay, let's go.

911
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:17,809
<i>Dawn to Ivan: We've checked
the ground floor and basement.</i>

912
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:20,774
<i>Waiting for further instructions.
Do you copy?</i>

913
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:23,196
<i>Copy that, Dawn.</i>

914
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:26,029
<i>Assist Fox-1 in the next building. Over.</i>

915
01:34:26,953 --> 01:34:28,990
<i>Copy that. Over.</i>

916
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:47,607
Pihto to Ivan: We've searched the roof
and the entire second floor.

917
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:49,366
Nothing.

918
01:35:49,535 --> 01:35:52,494
- Do you copy? Over.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

919
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:55,281
<i>Message to all:
Both buildings are empty.</i>

920
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:58,701
<i>The boy hasn't been found.
Move on to the forest.</i>

921
01:36:28,074 --> 01:36:29,485
- Hello.
- Hello.

922
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:31,525
- We need your help.
- Yes?

923
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:34,787
We're looking for Alexey Sleptsov,
12 years old.

924
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:36,037
This is his mom.

925
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:38,164
He may be using an alias.

926
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:41,748
Yesterday, you admitted
a boy matching the description.

927
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:43,662
Can we see him?

928
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:48,672
You two, please take a seat.
And you follow me.

929
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:52,846
- Is he okay?
- Yes. Just tired and scared.

930
01:36:53,016 --> 01:36:54,132
Scared by what?

931
01:36:54,309 --> 01:36:58,679
Being picked up by the cops.
Kept overnight.

932
01:36:58,855 --> 01:37:01,893
But they know about him.
I filed a statement.

933
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:05,400
They knew nothing.
It was a different shift.

934
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,732
They had no idea who the kid is.

935
01:37:07,905 --> 01:37:09,112
He said nothing...

936
01:37:09,282 --> 01:37:12,275
...so they brought him here.
Happens a lot.

937
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:16,362
This way.

938
01:37:18,082 --> 01:37:20,415
Hey, wake up.

939
01:37:59,248 --> 01:38:03,367
<i>Don't run ahead, and don't fall back.</i>

940
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:05,752
<i>Keep visual contact.</i>

941
01:38:05,922 --> 01:38:07,458
<i>Hold the line.</i>

942
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:40,866
No, I've not seen him.

943
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,909
You can't enter without a pass
or special permission. It's restricted.

944
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:48,705
May I leave flyers with you?
Perhaps your colleagues saw him.

945
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:51,624
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

946
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:53,167
Thanks!

947
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:07,560
<i>Fox-1 to call out to the boy.</i>

948
01:39:50,026 --> 01:39:54,111
Pihto to Ivan: We're at the river.
No trace of him here either.

949
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:56,112
- You copy that?
<i>- Copy that.</i>

950
01:39:56,282 --> 01:39:57,523
<i>Come back.</i>

951
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:00,317
- Copy that.
- What about the river?

952
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:02,319
We don't look for bodies.

953
01:40:02,497 --> 01:40:05,535
The police or Emergency Department
do that, if needed.

954
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:08,041
Team, we're wrapping up.

955
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:10,123
We're going back to base.

956
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:12,628
<i>Fox-1, we're wrapping up.</i>

957
01:40:18,763 --> 01:40:21,722
Given the lack of progress
in locating the runaway...

958
01:40:21,891 --> 01:40:27,307
...and a sharp change in weather,
we're moving on to the next phase.

959
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:31,690
We'll inform all the locals
as much as possible.

960
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:35,978
Post flyers in as many places
as possible.

961
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:38,613
That includes bus stops, underpasses...

962
01:40:38,783 --> 01:40:43,995
...apartment buildings, street poles,
benches, message boards, fences.

963
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:47,702
When posting in stores,
make sure you get permission.

964
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:49,741
You know the drill.

965
01:40:49,919 --> 01:40:54,129
I also need two groups of five
to check apartment stairwells.

966
01:40:55,758 --> 01:40:59,297
Great, we'll manage.
Everyone else, go put up the flyers.

967
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:00,836
Let's go.

968
01:41:01,013 --> 01:41:03,255
Get the flyers from me.

969
01:41:22,368 --> 01:41:23,700
Wait.

970
01:41:31,377 --> 01:41:35,417
Dawn to Ivan:
The elevator stopped on the third floor.

971
01:41:36,173 --> 01:41:37,960
<i>Got it. I'll be waiting.</i>

972
01:41:42,805 --> 01:41:44,421
It's going down.

973
01:42:05,578 --> 01:42:07,194
Hello.

974
01:42:10,082 --> 01:42:12,165
Dawn to Ivan: It's not him.

975
01:42:12,335 --> 01:42:13,871
<i>Copy that.</i>

976
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:21,132
- Why, hello there.
- Come on.

977
01:42:21,302 --> 01:42:23,089
Sorry about her.

978
01:42:24,722 --> 01:42:26,133
You nutcase.

979
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:28,014
You're the nutcase.

980
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:33,144
I was so close
to getting me a man there.

981
01:42:33,314 --> 01:42:35,522
Look. Little green men!

982
01:42:35,941 --> 01:42:40,686
- Which planet are you boys from?
- Just walk on by, girls.

983
01:42:40,863 --> 01:42:42,729
You're so polite!

984
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:45,650
Such killer charm!

985
01:49:56,673 --> 01:49:58,289
Wait here.

986
01:50:06,558 --> 01:50:08,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

987
01:50:08,977 --> 01:50:10,559
We're here.

988
01:50:36,547 --> 01:50:38,288
Anton...

989
01:50:54,606 --> 01:50:56,268
This won't be easy.

990
01:50:59,528 --> 01:51:00,985
I'm ready.

991
01:51:09,705 --> 01:51:11,321
My God...

992
01:51:30,475 --> 01:51:32,341
That's not him.

993
01:51:35,647 --> 01:51:37,889
Alexey has a mole on his chest.

994
01:51:38,066 --> 01:51:39,853
A mole on his chest.

995
01:51:42,779 --> 01:51:44,236
That's not him.

996
01:51:44,907 --> 01:51:46,489
You sure?

997
01:51:48,285 --> 01:51:50,277
No, that's not him.

998
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:58,077
Hands, fingers, hair... no, it's not him.

999
01:52:05,302 --> 01:52:07,339
Please take him away.

1000
01:52:08,764 --> 01:52:10,847
Please take him away.

1001
01:52:18,106 --> 01:52:22,521
We should run a DNA test
to be absolutely sure.

1002
01:52:22,694 --> 01:52:24,526
Sure of what? It's not him.

1003
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:27,404
Sometimes,
people just refuse to believe...

1004
01:52:27,574 --> 01:52:31,238
- How many times must we tell you?
- Listen to me.

1005
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:33,403
Only you can do this test.

1006
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:35,412
The cops are still stalling.

1007
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:39,451
Didn't you hear? It's not him!
Don't you get it?

1008
01:52:39,628 --> 01:52:42,336
- Are we talking different languages?
- Zhenya...

1009
01:52:42,506 --> 01:52:43,997
It's not him!

1010
01:52:44,174 --> 01:52:48,714
Why aren't you saying anything? Why?

1011
01:52:48,887 --> 01:52:52,471
I would have never given him up!
You hear me, scumbag?

1012
01:52:52,641 --> 01:52:55,099
I'd never give him to anyone!

1013
01:52:55,269 --> 01:52:58,057
Never in a million years!

1014
01:53:01,024 --> 01:53:02,560
Help her.

1015
01:53:12,035 --> 01:53:14,743
Easy now, easy.

1016
01:55:34,886 --> 01:55:39,381
<i>...cities of Donbass remain
under deadly Ukrainian artillery fire.</i>

1017
01:55:39,558 --> 01:55:41,299
<i>Mines or shells hit here.</i>

1018
01:55:41,476 --> 01:55:44,059
<i>When will this war end?</i>

1019
01:55:54,322 --> 01:55:56,735
<i>This week, it became quite clear...</i>

1020
01:55:56,908 --> 01:56:00,743
<i>...that eastern Ukraine is at war again...</i>

1021
01:56:04,833 --> 01:56:10,079
So your aunt and I talked it over.
Basically, she's agreed.

1022
01:56:10,255 --> 01:56:11,746
Want some?

1023
01:56:12,674 --> 01:56:15,542
What about you? Are you ready?

1024
01:56:17,971 --> 01:56:19,678
Have you talked to him?

1025
01:56:20,223 --> 01:56:23,136
I did. He said he'd think about it.

1026
01:56:23,685 --> 01:56:27,770
What's there to think about?
It's a perfect solution.

1027
01:56:28,482 --> 01:56:32,396
Masha, you know we're living
on top of each other here.

1028
01:56:38,533 --> 01:56:41,867
<i>Destroyed armored vehicles
are everywhere.</i>

1029
01:56:42,037 --> 01:56:46,907
<i>The city is still under fire. Shots can
be heard just 100 meters away.</i>

1030
01:56:47,083 --> 01:56:51,874
<i>Kiev won't reveal the numbers
of casualties in the armed forces.</i>

1031
01:56:52,047 --> 01:56:55,961
<i>The DPR reports that over
100 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.</i>

1032
01:57:10,941 --> 01:57:13,183
Mommy!

1033
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:20,194
<i>Thousands dead. Tens of thousands
wounded. Countless refugees.</i>

1034
01:57:20,367 --> 01:57:23,951
<i>Living conditions in these cities
and villages are horrific.</i>

1035
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:27,363
<i>Ukraine has fallen apart
and continues to do so.</i>

1036
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:32,502
<i>The Ukrainian army is disorganized,
deceived and demoralized.</i>

1037
01:57:32,671 --> 01:57:36,085
<i>The government in Kiev is run
by foreigners...</i>

1038
01:57:36,258 --> 01:57:40,343
<i>...or those who put the interests
of the West before those of Ukraine.</i>

1039
01:57:40,512 --> 01:57:44,051
<i>I can hear explosions.
Death is very close.</i>

1040
01:57:44,224 --> 01:57:45,840
<i>People perish daily.</i>

1041
01:57:46,017 --> 01:57:50,887
<i>May Poroshenko,
the government, their families...</i>

1042
01:57:51,064 --> 01:57:54,148
<i>...grandchildren,
great-grandchildren, mothers...</i>

1043
01:57:54,317 --> 01:57:57,560
<i>...may they live six months in this terror!</i>

1044
01:57:57,737 --> 01:57:59,194
<i>What are we dying for?</i>

1045
01:57:59,364 --> 01:58:02,448
<i>We're miners, builders, drivers!</i>

1046
01:58:02,617 --> 01:58:06,782
<i>We're the working class.
Why are you torturing us?</i>

1047
01:58:06,955 --> 01:58:10,119
<i>After each shoot-out,
the streets are full of bodies.</i>

1048
01:58:10,292 --> 01:58:13,956
<i>Over 50 people were killed
this past week in Donetsk alone.</i>

1049
01:58:14,129 --> 01:58:16,086
<i>Lift him onto the stretcher.</i>

1050
01:58:16,256 --> 01:58:19,715
<i>The shells landed next
to a local cultural center.</i>

1051
01:58:19,884 --> 01:58:24,549
<i>People came here for bread
and other humanitarian aid.</i>

1052
01:58:24,723 --> 01:58:29,764
<i>After a large crowd formed,
they came under fire.</i>

1053
01:58:29,936 --> 01:58:35,182
<i>Cars were destroyed.
Five people died, many were wounded.</i>

1054
01:58:35,358 --> 01:58:38,396
<i>People came here to get food.</i>

1055
01:58:38,570 --> 01:58:41,608
<i>Bread can be seen
amid the mutilated bodies.</i>

1056
01:58:41,781 --> 01:58:45,445
<i>Donetsk and Gorlovka
are now partly underground cities.</i>

1057
01:58:45,619 --> 01:58:48,077
<i>Artillery fire drives people to shelters.</i>

1058
01:58:48,246 --> 01:58:51,330
<i>Some hide in groups.
Others with just their family.</i>

1059
01:58:51,499 --> 01:58:56,244
<i>In one cramped basement lives
a woman: Elena Rodina.</i>

1060
01:58:56,421 --> 01:59:00,131
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

1061
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:02,292
<i>Under four blankets.</i>

1062
01:59:02,469 --> 01:59:04,085
<i>Surviving this is hard.</i>

1063
01:59:04,262 --> 01:59:08,802
<i>- Is it cold at night?
- Yes, it takes two hours to warm up.</i>

1064
01:59:08,975 --> 01:59:12,013
<i>After that, it's possible to sleep.</i>

1065
01:59:12,187 --> 01:59:16,602
<i>Just a few kilometers away,
shelling is a rare occurrence.</i>

1066
01:59:16,775 --> 01:59:18,937
<i>People here get to see daylight.</i>

1067
01:59:19,110 --> 01:59:21,102
<i>But it's clearly still Donetsk.</i>

1068
02:00:15,166 --> 02:00:18,409
Alexey Sleptsov, born in 2000.

1069
02:00:18,586 --> 02:00:24,753
On October 10, 2012, he left home,
walking down Svetlogorsk Street.

1070
02:00:24,926 --> 02:00:28,044
He hasn't been seen since.

1071
02:06:40,218 --> 02:06:42,210
