1
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,912
Tomorrow marks
the one year anniversary

2
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:23,748
since Velez Air Flight 180
exploded and crashed

3
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,081
shortly after takeoff
from JFK Airport.

4
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:28,250
It's a disaster
that's affected many.

5
00:00:28,343 --> 00:00:31,095
None more so than
Mt Abraham High School,

6
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:35,259
which lost 40 students and four
faculty members in the crash.

7
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,675
But it was the events
after the crash

8
00:00:37,769 --> 00:00:40,936
that has turned this tragic story
into something even stranger.

9
00:00:41,022 --> 00:00:44,806
The survivors who managed
to get off the plane before it crashed

10
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:46,941
died soon thereafter
in a series

11
00:00:47,028 --> 00:00:49,436
of mysterious
and bizarre accidents.

12
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:52,899
Now, to some, these deaths
are just tragic coincidences,

13
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,949
but to others,
they're an indication

14
00:00:55,036 --> 00:00:57,609
that there are more
sinister events taking place.

15
00:00:57,705 --> 00:00:59,614
That's the contention
of tonight's guest.

16
00:00:59,707 --> 00:01:01,581
Thank you for joining us
this evening.

17
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,245
Thank you for having me.

18
00:01:03,336 --> 00:01:05,375
And I appreciate you using
the word sinister.

19
00:01:05,463 --> 00:01:08,036
Most people say supernatural
because they think I'm talking

20
00:01:08,132 --> 00:01:11,418
about ghosts and witches
and stuff like that.

21
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,084
Here's your chance
to set the record straight.

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,587
Great. Okay.

23
00:01:16,682 --> 00:01:20,265
I believe that there's
a sort of force,

24
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:24,266
an unseen malevolent
presence...

25
00:01:24,356 --> 00:01:26,265
that's all around us
every day.

26
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:29,809
And it determines
when we live and die.

27
00:01:31,154 --> 00:01:34,274
And some people call
this force the devil,

28
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:36,939
but I think that
whole religious thing is...

29
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:40,285
so I prefer to call it
Death itself.

30
00:01:40,372 --> 00:01:42,945
So I'm surrounded by Death?

31
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,117
Absolutely. Absolutely.

32
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,626
Every day, everywhere,
all the time.

33
00:01:48,713 --> 00:01:51,287
And that's what I want people
to understand...

34
00:01:51,382 --> 00:01:53,292
that Death
has this grand design

35
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:55,460
that we all fit into.

36
00:01:55,553 --> 00:01:58,305
So when Alex Browning
got off that plane

37
00:01:58,389 --> 00:02:00,465
and took the other
survivors with him,

38
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:03,049
he basically screwed up
Death's plan.

39
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:05,896
And that's what I'm trying
to warn people about.

40
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,064
And the fact that all
of the survivors have died

41
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,308
is your evidence of this?

42
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:15,900
Well, it's not so much
that the survivors died,

43
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,113
but it's the way
that they died.

44
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:21,574
I mean, there were
so many weird,

45
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:24,449
seemingly random things
about the way they died.

46
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,240
It just didn't
make sense.

47
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:31,253
And that's the proof
there's something out there...

48
00:02:31,338 --> 00:02:35,003
Wait, that's not proof.
That is your interpretation

49
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:38,128
of events that can't be proven
in order to support your ideas.

50
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,259
Kimberly.

51
00:02:40,347 --> 00:02:42,589
You should be more
open-minded...

52
00:02:42,682 --> 00:02:45,470
What happened after that
was just coincidence.

53
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,553
May I finish?

54
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:50,600
Mere coincidence would have
one or two of these kids die.

55
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,932
But not all of them
including their teachers.

56
00:02:53,026 --> 00:02:55,433
Yes, but people die
all the time,

57
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:57,936
so why should this be
any different?

58
00:02:58,031 --> 00:03:00,403
It forced people
to question

59
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:03,029
these so-called
everyday coincidences.

60
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:05,028
What if they
were something more?

61
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:07,197
What if you could do
something about it?

62
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,041
Please, are you listening
to yourself? This is crazy.

63
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:13,411
You're saying we should be on guard
every morning when we leave the house?

64
00:03:13,504 --> 00:03:16,209
That's exactly what
I'm saying.

65
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:18,540
Exactly it.

66
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:20,425
And in order
to survive...

67
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:22,919
the only way to survive

68
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:25,255
is to look beneath
the visible world.

69
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:29,263
Because in the end no one
can escape death.

70
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:31,926
And today may be
your day to die.

71
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:46,242
Okay, I'll call you.

72
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:48,404
Kimberly, are you sure
you've got everything?

73
00:03:48,497 --> 00:03:50,573
Credit card,
cell phone, Triple-A card?

74
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:53,073
Dad, it's Daytona,
not Somalia.

75
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:56,916
Alright. Fix-a-flat, road flares,
sunblock, mace?

76
00:03:57,005 --> 00:03:59,412
Condoms,
whips, chains.

77
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:02,086
Just kidding,
Mr. Corman.

78
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:04,003
Don't worry,
I'll keep an eye on her.

79
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:06,716
That makes me feel
a lot better, thanks.

80
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:10,181
- Okay.
- Alrighty.

81
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:13,434
Can we go get the guys?
I'm getting horny.

82
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:17,522
Go on.

83
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,767
Okay, I'll call you.

84
00:04:22,238 --> 00:04:24,693
Whips and chains.
That's nice.

85
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:27,024
Whatever,
your dad's cool.

86
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:32,156
Buckle up!

87
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,225
Watch it!

88
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:05,522
- Oh, easy, Kimmy. First year of driving?
- Sorry.

89
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,818
- Oh my God.
- Fucking freak.

90
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:17,121
Yo, Dano,
shouldn't we help your mum?

91
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,082
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.

92
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,711
You're not getting any of my weed.
Nothing.

93
00:05:22,797 --> 00:05:23,959
Whatever.

94
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:26,373
What are we going to do
in Daytona?

95
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:28,673
We're going to see lots
of honeys there.

96
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,631
We're gonna get drunk, we're gonna smoke
this big 'El Gagerero,'

97
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:33,513
We're gonna have this
awesome party...

98
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,172
Pileup! Pileup!

99
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:49,359
A candlelight vigil to mark
the one year anniversary

100
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:52,532
of the crash of Flight 180
will be held at 8:00 P.M. Tonight

101
00:05:52,617 --> 00:05:54,693
at the Mt Abraham
high school auditorium.

102
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:58,202
# Highway to hell... #

103
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:13,962
Oh my God.

104
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:20,007
- Hello?
- Hey, Kimberly, it's Dad.

105
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:23,353
- Hey, what's up?
- Your car's leaking transmission fluid.

106
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,930
- So I want you to get it checked right away.
- Okay, yeah.

107
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:27,567
I'll do that.

108
00:06:27,652 --> 00:06:29,609
I mean it. Take care of it.

109
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,237
- Is that someone coughing?
- Yeah, okay.

110
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:35,530
I'll take care of it.
I'll talk to you later.

111
00:06:35,618 --> 00:06:37,409
- I love you.
- Bye, honey.

112
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:41,152
- What did you do?
- Look at those titties!

113
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,741
- Shut up.
- You missed that?!

114
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:49,078
That's too bad.
That's too bad.

115
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,249
Oh, shit!

116
00:06:52,342 --> 00:06:55,213
Fuck man, there's a cop behind us!
Pull in the right lane now!

117
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:56,762
Shit.

118
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:06,978
Seriously, put it out.

119
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:09,141
- Put that thing out.
- Alright.

120
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:10,728
Wait, wait, wait!

121
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:12,526
- Get rid of it.
- Shit.

122
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:17,569
Hey, it's Kat.

123
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:19,651
Listen...
what the hell?!

124
00:07:19,744 --> 00:07:21,535
Just wait. Not you.

125
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:40,338
I think we better pull over
and check the car, because...

126
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:42,838
Kimberly, the car
is going to be fine.

127
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:46,183
Your dad's going to be fine,
you're going to be fine.

128
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,061
Okay?

129
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:18,506
Look at that guy.

130
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:22,721
He's drinking a beer.

131
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:27,216
Oh, yeah,
that's real responsible.

132
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:03,796
You ever hear
of the ozone layer, arsehole?!

133
00:09:31,622 --> 00:09:34,493
# When it comes to this drug shit
I was made to play #

134
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:38,877
# Don't come around if
you ain't got no cocaine to bring... #

135
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:49,007
What? I'm wearing
my seatbelt.

136
00:09:49,098 --> 00:09:51,767
You're gonna bust me,
bitch?!

137
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:08,528
Aaah!

138
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:10,111
Son of a...

139
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:12,620
bitch.

140
00:10:25,717 --> 00:10:27,259
Fuck!

141
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:03,000
- Oh my God!
- Watch out!

142
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:04,960
- Stop!
- Oh my God!

143
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:06,873
Watch out!
Aaah!

144
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:52,748
Shaina?

145
00:11:56,931 --> 00:11:59,600
I can't get out of here!

146
00:12:01,143 --> 00:12:02,934
Help me!

147
00:12:14,072 --> 00:12:16,777
Oh, easy, Kimmy.
First year of driving?

148
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:33,040
Yo, Dano,
shouldn't we help your mum?

149
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:35,291
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.

150
00:12:35,385 --> 00:12:37,543
Pileup! Pileup!

151
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:41,381
- Oh my God.
- What?

152
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:43,383
There's going to be
a huge accident.

153
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:45,267
We're all gonna die!
I just saw it.

154
00:12:45,353 --> 00:12:46,847
That's it.
My turn to drive.

155
00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:49,429
- No, I'm serious.
- Kim, what's wrong?

156
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:54,397
- What are you doing?
- Oh my God.

157
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:57,404
...of Flight 180 will be held
at 8:00 P.M. Tonight

00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:03,366
'Highway to hell.'
'Highway to hell... '

160
00:13:03,454 --> 00:13:04,996
'Highway to hell'?

161
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,452
# I'm on a highway to hell... #

162
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,165
Okay, Kimberly,
you're scaring me.

163
00:13:11,545 --> 00:13:13,703
- Green means go, Kimmy.
- Yeah.

164
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,044
Are you out of your friggin' mind?
What the hell are you doing?

165
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:24,515
What the fuck, Kimberly?

166
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,718
What's this?

167
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:36,691
Kimberly, you just got
to breathe.

168
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:39,529
Oh, shit, shit.
Five-O's coming. Let's fucking roll.

169
00:13:39,614 --> 00:13:41,405
- What?
- Oh my God.

170
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:43,317
Do you know how much
fucking weed I have on me? Huh?

171
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:45,983
Okay, Dano, just shut up!
Just stay cool.

172
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:56,374
Oh, fuck. I'm going to jail.
I'm fucking going to jail.

173
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,685
What's going on here?

174
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,059
I think there's going
to be a huge pileup.

175
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:16,187
I saw it.

176
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:18,184
There were bodies
everywhere.

177
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:20,186
There were logs...
I saw it.

178
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:21,938
It just happened.

179
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,233
Alright, miss, I'd like you to please
step out of the vehicle.

180
00:14:36,086 --> 00:14:38,208
Just pull over!

181
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:40,752
I know,
Mummy's hungry, too.

182
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:46,385
Come on.

183
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:48,843
Come on!

184
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,888
Oh, fuck this.

185
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:54,261
I'm going to get this
and we're going to go.

186
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:07,903
Fuck.

187
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:10,233
What the hell
is going on up there?

188
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,786
Excuse me!

189
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,444
Is there any way
that we could drive around?

190
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,457
- I have a delivery...
- You need to get back into your vehicles.

191
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:19,369
- Just move it...
- Now!

192
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,383
That's it!

193
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,925
That's the truck
that's going to kill everybody.

194
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,721
You need to stop
that truck!

195
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,633
I told you again,
you have to calm down!

196
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,346
Why won't you listen to me?!

197
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,179
- Fuck!
- Oh my God.

198
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,859
This is unit 13 requesting
medical assistance

199
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,523
and backup for a major
traffic accident...

200
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,826
Kimberly, what's going on?

201
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,976
No!

202
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,021
No!

203
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,329
Listen, sir,
this girl is really freaked out.

204
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:45,617
In fact, all of them are...

205
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:47,835
- scared as you can imagine.
- Scared?!

206
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:51,172
These people are the luckiest
sons of bitches on the planet.

207
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:52,670
Get this guy,
Evan Lewis...

208
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,504
yesterday the kid
wins the lotto.

209
00:16:54,595 --> 00:16:56,505
Today, some loony bitch
blocks traffic

210
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:58,507
and he avoids the worst
pileup in years.

211
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,343
I should be
so damn 'unlucky.'

212
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:01,845
Go babysit the rest of them.

213
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:03,644
I'll be done with Lewis
in a minute.

214
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:06,814
Hey, excuse me...

215
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:08,642
We're trying to do
the best we can.

216
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:11,308
We're going to get you
out of here as soon as possible.

217
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:14,025
I just think it's a bunch
of bullshit.

218
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:21,821
Listen, I know
you've gone over all this

219
00:17:21,914 --> 00:17:23,705
with Detective Suby...

220
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,210
but would you mind
telling me what happened?

221
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:31,873
It was like I was there.

222
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:38,044
I knew something bad was going
to happen even before it did.

223
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:43,598
- I just felt wrong, just like...
- Just like what?

224
00:17:48,064 --> 00:17:50,816
Look, I know
this sounds crazy but...

225
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,272
you guys all heard
about Flight 180, right?

226
00:17:53,361 --> 00:17:55,400
The kid who got off
the plane?

227
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:57,611
Well, it happened
a year ago, today.

228
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:02,818
My premonition
was just like his.

229
00:18:06,582 --> 00:18:09,785
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

230
00:18:09,877 --> 00:18:11,537
You must have read
about the kid

231
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:13,538
who had a dream
about a plane blowing up,

232
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,540
so he got all his buddies
off the plane

233
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:18,302
and then the thing blew up
just like in his dream?

234
00:18:18,385 --> 00:18:20,876
- Yeah.
- But did you hear what happened after?

235
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:24,215
So a month goes by, right?

236
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:26,384
Everything seems cool.

237
00:18:27,728 --> 00:18:30,349
But then all the survivors
start to die one by one.

238
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:33,108
'Cause when your number's up,
your number's up, right?

239
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:40,063
You know, some people even say that
Death itself was stalking them,

240
00:18:40,157 --> 00:18:42,398
hunting each one down

241
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:46,027
until they were all...
dead.

242
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,666
Please.

243
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:55,459
There was one survivor.

244
00:18:57,465 --> 00:18:59,256
Clear Rivers is
in a padded room

245
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:02,047
at the Stonybrook Institution.

246
00:19:02,136 --> 00:19:03,761
Well, that's encouraging.

247
00:19:06,432 --> 00:19:09,219
Okay, you want me
to believe that this is true,

248
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:12,062
that this is happening
all over again?

249
00:19:12,146 --> 00:19:14,269
I don't know why
we're even here.

250
00:19:15,858 --> 00:19:17,400
What do you want from me?

251
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:20,236
But if I was never meant
to pull over,

252
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:22,776
we all should have died
in that pileup.

253
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:24,857
Which means Death
could be coming for us.

254
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,741
Yeah, like, what if

255
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:30,410
we're all getting that 'Different Strokes'
curse or something?

256
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:33,249
I think you're all
are certifiable.

257
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,409
I can't believe I've been listening
to this crap.

258
00:19:35,502 --> 00:19:38,254
Let's go.
Let's go, Tim.

259
00:19:38,338 --> 00:19:41,125
Mrs. Carpenter, please.

260
00:19:45,971 --> 00:19:47,797
Kimberly!

261
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:51,057
Oh baby!

262
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,766
- Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry.

263
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:56,396
Shh, shh.

264
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:58,853
You can all go now.
Thank you for your patience.

265
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:21,294
Could I ask you something?

266
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,788
Anything.

267
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:26,634
Did Mum ever have any...

268
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:30,301
I don't know,
weird feelings about anything?

269
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:33,139
What do you mean?

270
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:39,351
Like visions or premonitions.

271
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:42,813
Sweetie, are you sure
you're okay?

272
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:45,653
Dad, I know
this sounds crazy,

273
00:20:45,737 --> 00:20:47,979
but I'm really scared
for the others.

274
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:51,857
I don't know,
I have this really bad feeling.

275
00:20:53,203 --> 00:20:54,697
What?

276
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:58,370
It's not over yet.

277
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,436
Jesus Christ!

278
00:21:23,524 --> 00:21:25,481
Shit!

279
00:22:55,864 --> 00:22:58,781
Hey, Evan, it's Tawny.

280
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:00,776
Sorry I haven't called.

281
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:03,573
Hey, listen, I heard
about your lottery win.

282
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:06,284
Let's hook up.
Call me.

283
00:23:06,374 --> 00:23:08,746
Yeah.

284
00:23:08,835 --> 00:23:10,578
Hi, Evan, it's Nikki.

285
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,793
We met at Tucker's party
last year?

286
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,454
I know it's been awhile,
but I've been thinking about you.

287
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,254
I just wanted to say
congratulations.

288
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:20,301
So give me a call.

289
00:23:20,388 --> 00:23:22,630
555-0123. Bye.

290
00:23:24,183 --> 00:23:26,140
You little bastard.

291
00:23:26,227 --> 00:23:27,887
Shit.

292
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:35,651
Come on.
Come on.

293
00:23:42,993 --> 00:23:45,033
Fuck. Fuck.

294
00:23:55,338 --> 00:23:57,130
Come on!

295
00:23:57,215 --> 00:23:58,875
Come on.

296
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:06,724
Fuck!

297
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:08,183
Jesus!

298
00:24:16,192 --> 00:24:17,307
Oh!

299
00:24:24,242 --> 00:24:26,151
Hey, this is Evan.
Leave a message.

300
00:24:26,244 --> 00:24:28,735
If you're looking for Rick,
I don't know where he is,

301
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:31,581
and I don't know
when he's coming back. Thanks.

302
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:35,615
Evan, call me when you
get in, you lucky fuck!

303
00:25:03,113 --> 00:25:06,279
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

304
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:08,109
Aah!

305
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:40,064
Jesus!

306
00:25:44,653 --> 00:25:46,313
Come on.

307
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,990
Aah!

308
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,624
Shit, I'm lucky.

309
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:04,920
Aah!

310
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:09,960
Jesus Christ!

311
00:27:35,928 --> 00:27:37,885
No, Mother,

312
00:27:37,972 --> 00:27:40,641
just turn on any station.

313
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,891
Well, I don't know how you missed it,
it's been on all day.

314
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:46,551
Yes, Mother,
Channel 4 is fine.

315
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:49,731
Okay... here it is!
I got to go, okay?

316
00:27:49,817 --> 00:27:51,726
I got to go!

317
00:27:52,778 --> 00:27:54,569
To recap our top story,

318
00:27:54,655 --> 00:27:58,238
Route 23 was backed up
for almost nine hours today.

319
00:27:58,325 --> 00:28:01,409
A record-breaking pileup
killed an estimated 18 people.

320
00:28:01,495 --> 00:28:04,531
Emergency crews spent hours
sifting through the wreckage

321
00:28:04,623 --> 00:28:07,707
hoping to recover any survivors
from this tragic collision.

322
00:28:07,793 --> 00:28:10,747
So far police are refusing
to release the names of the victims

323
00:28:10,837 --> 00:28:12,545
until the families
are notified.

324
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:14,457
The camera
of a highway patrol car

325
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:16,458
managed to catch
this shocking footage.

326
00:28:16,551 --> 00:28:18,591
- A semi comes...
- Oh my God.

327
00:28:18,678 --> 00:28:20,552
And smashes
into a red SUV.

328
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:24,221
- The driver of the SUV...
- No, um...

329
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:25,720
leave it.

330
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,221
...may have
saved her life.

331
00:28:27,312 --> 00:28:29,138
He pulled her back
at the last second

332
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,270
just as the semi ploughed
into the vehicle.

333
00:28:31,357 --> 00:28:33,101
The passengers inside
the SUV...

334
00:28:33,192 --> 00:28:35,979
Oh, oh, oh! You guys see that?!
Shit, I was there, baby!

335
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:40,020
In other news, a freak accident took
the life of a lotto winner.

336
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:41,943
- Friends say Evan Lewis...
- Hey, shh.

337
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:45,735
Was on top of the world after
recently winning $250,000.

338
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,499
But in tragic turn of events,
Lewis died today

339
00:28:48,582 --> 00:28:51,156
while trying to escape a fire
in his apartment.

340
00:28:51,252 --> 00:28:52,995
He managed to make it out
of the building,

341
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:55,245
but somehow the ladder
on the fire escape

342
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:57,248
slipped and impaled him.

343
00:28:57,341 --> 00:28:59,832
Investigators believe Lewis
died instantly.

344
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:10,060
Come in.

345
00:29:11,897 --> 00:29:13,391
Hey, buddy.

346
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,735
I want you to take this
so you can get some sleep.

347
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:22,904
And then tomorrow it's off to the dentist,
which I know you love.

348
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:26,403
Now, get some rest.

349
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:33,537
- Mum.
- Yeah?

350
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:35,666
You think those guys
were BSing us today?

351
00:29:35,753 --> 00:29:37,497
Yeah.

352
00:29:37,588 --> 00:29:39,996
Some people just need
some rewiring, that's all.

353
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:42,920
Lights out.

354
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:43,457
At the request
of the patient,

355
00:31:43,544 --> 00:31:45,537
you'll relinquish
any sharp objects

356
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,955
such as: 'nail files,
pencils, pens,

357
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:50,966
safety pins, bobby pins,
your necklace,

358
00:31:51,052 --> 00:31:53,625
matches, lighters,
belts, belt buckles,

359
00:31:53,721 --> 00:31:56,805
earrings, hair clips,
glasses, shoelaces,

360
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:59,927
paper clips, watches, money clip,
pocket knives,

361
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:02,640
food, drinks, keys,
cell phone... '

362
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,888
You have a cell phone
on you?

363
00:32:04,982 --> 00:32:07,899
'... poisons, pills,
medications.'

364
00:32:07,985 --> 00:32:10,558
Great. And let me see
your nails.

365
00:32:10,654 --> 00:32:13,228
Good. Then I think
we're all done.

366
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:15,233
Wait.

367
00:32:15,325 --> 00:32:17,235
Is she dangerous
or something?

368
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:19,284
No, honey,
she expects you are.

369
00:32:21,915 --> 00:32:25,082
No, no, no.

370
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:28,371
Get him off me.
Get him off me!

371
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:38,502
How long are they gonna keep
her locked up like this?

372
00:32:38,598 --> 00:32:41,054
Depends on her, I guess.
She's voluntary.

373
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:11,749
- Clear Rivers?
- Don't come any closer.

374
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:23,554
They told me you had something to do
with the crash on Route 23.

375
00:33:23,642 --> 00:33:26,559
Look, I don't know how
to explain it,

376
00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:29,930
but I saw the pileup
before it happened.

377
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:33,517
And I saved some people.

378
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,935
And now you think Death
is after you.

379
00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:39,778
Nice work.

380
00:33:39,866 --> 00:33:43,116
Maybe if you're real lucky,
you'll wind up in here with me.

381
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,364
Anything else?

382
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:48,911
One of the people died
in a freak accident last night.

383
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,076
What if the other people
are in danger, too?

384
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:53,541
If you put them on the list,
they're already dead.

385
00:33:53,629 --> 00:33:55,918
List? What list?

386
00:33:56,007 --> 00:33:58,165
Death's list.

387
00:34:00,636 --> 00:34:02,878
The survivors of Flight 180

388
00:34:02,972 --> 00:34:05,214
died in the exact order

389
00:34:05,308 --> 00:34:08,095
they were originally meant
to die in the plane crash.

390
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,262
That was Death's original design.

391
00:34:12,648 --> 00:34:14,272
The list.

392
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:16,814
I was supposed to die
in that crash with my friends.

393
00:34:16,902 --> 00:34:18,562
So you're telling me
that I'm next?

394
00:34:18,654 --> 00:34:20,812
You said someone else died
last night.

395
00:34:20,906 --> 00:34:22,946
That means someone must
have intervened.

396
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:27,280
Officer Burke pulled me away
from the crash that killed my friends.

397
00:34:27,371 --> 00:34:29,244
Congratulations.

398
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:31,904
You'll be the last to go.

399
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,574
But don't worry,
once the others are dead,

400
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:36,294
it'll come back for you.

401
00:34:37,631 --> 00:34:39,670
It always does.

402
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:42,711
This doesn't make sense.

403
00:34:42,802 --> 00:34:47,132
You said that you die in
the order you're originally meant to.

404
00:34:47,223 --> 00:34:50,972
But my friends died last
in my premonition, not first.

405
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,018
Wait.

406
00:34:54,147 --> 00:34:56,472
Died last?

407
00:34:58,484 --> 00:35:00,358
Backwards.

408
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:02,484
Are you sure?

409
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:06,198
In my premonition

410
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:08,193
that Nora woman
and her kid died.

411
00:35:08,286 --> 00:35:11,405
Then Evan,
then me and my friends.

412
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,575
Why is this even
happening to me?

413
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,415
That's what Alex used
to ask himself.

414
00:35:25,094 --> 00:35:27,382
So, what am I
supposed to do?

415
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:29,428
Clear.

416
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:32,891
Watch out for the signs.

417
00:35:32,976 --> 00:35:34,684
What?

418
00:35:37,105 --> 00:35:40,142
Have you ever seen anything
creepy or ominous?

419
00:35:40,233 --> 00:35:42,938
An in-your-face irony
kind of thing?

420
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,735
The songs on the radio.

421
00:35:47,824 --> 00:35:50,778
Yeah, the guy in the beer truck,
everything on the road.

422
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:53,110
Well, don't ignore it.

423
00:35:53,204 --> 00:35:56,822
Recognizing those signs usually means
the difference between life and death.

424
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:59,372
You got to help me.

425
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,085
I don't have
to do anything.

426
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,878
But you beat it.

427
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:04,707
Take a look around.

428
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,756
What did I beat, Kimberly?

429
00:36:09,095 --> 00:36:12,345
If you were smart, you'd save yourself
and just forget about the others.

430
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:15,005
How can you say that?
You have a responsibility.

431
00:36:15,101 --> 00:36:17,223
My friends are dead.

432
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:19,268
That's how I can say that.

433
00:36:21,148 --> 00:36:24,482
This is what happened to Alex
when I was responsible for him.

434
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:27,568
Get out.

435
00:36:27,654 --> 00:36:30,027
Before you hurt me or yourself.

436
00:36:33,952 --> 00:36:36,787
- Alright, you know what?
- What?

437
00:36:36,872 --> 00:36:38,247
I think you're a coward.

438
00:36:38,332 --> 00:36:39,956
You hide out in here
because you're

439
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:43,245
too damn bitter and selfish
to help any other person.

440
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:45,246
In my opinion,
you're already dead.

441
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,290
I tried calling you
last night,

442
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:27,370
but your father said
you were sleeping.

443
00:37:27,463 --> 00:37:29,171
- Evan Lewis is dead.
- Yeah.

444
00:37:29,256 --> 00:37:32,542
I've been getting calls all morning from
everyone who was on the on-ramp.

445
00:37:32,634 --> 00:37:34,757
We're meeting tonight
at my apartment.

446
00:37:34,845 --> 00:37:38,095
Wait, so...
you believe all this Death stuff?

447
00:37:39,308 --> 00:37:41,881
Well, at first,
no, I didn't.

448
00:37:41,977 --> 00:37:44,053
Until last year
when I was dispatched

449
00:37:44,146 --> 00:37:46,434
to clean up one
of the Flight 180 survivors.

450
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:48,266
Clean up, I don't...

451
00:37:52,821 --> 00:37:55,312
- Did you see that?
- See what?

452
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,898
- Pigeons.
- Pigeons?

453
00:37:57,992 --> 00:37:59,902
- It's a sign.
- A sign of what?

454
00:37:59,994 --> 00:38:01,738
If Clear's right
about the order,

455
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,996
then Nora and Tim are going
to be attacked by pigeons.

456
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,577
I'm not following you.

457
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:08,328
They're next
on Death's list.

458
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,875
If we don't find them,
they're going to die.

459
00:38:58,593 --> 00:39:00,586
The doctor's ready
for you, now.

460
00:39:00,678 --> 00:39:02,505
If he gives me the gas

461
00:39:02,597 --> 00:39:04,673
and I wake up
with my pants unbuttoned...

462
00:39:04,766 --> 00:39:08,300
- we ain't paying.
- Tim.

463
00:39:15,735 --> 00:39:19,684
There you are.
What happened to you yesterday, Tim?

464
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,527
We missed you in here.

465
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:23,152
We got hung up by that accident on
Route 23.

466
00:39:23,242 --> 00:39:25,911
Good Lord.
How lucky that you're okay.

467
00:39:27,621 --> 00:39:29,744
Your mum says you've been
having some pain lately.

468
00:39:29,832 --> 00:39:32,038
Not really.

469
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:59,232
I'm disappointed, Tim.

470
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:00,647
Does your mum know
you've been smoking?

471
00:40:00,737 --> 00:40:03,904
Uh-huh.
Ow.

472
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,113
Yeah, that one's going
to have to be filled.

473
00:40:07,494 --> 00:40:09,320
Damn those pigeons.

474
00:40:09,412 --> 00:40:12,828
How many times am I going to have to
replace those goddamn windows?

475
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:18,080
We can't do it, boss,
we can't do it!

476
00:40:18,171 --> 00:40:20,792
This will only sting for a moment.

477
00:40:20,882 --> 00:40:23,088
Open big.

478
00:40:23,175 --> 00:40:24,753
Little bit wider.

479
00:40:24,844 --> 00:40:26,753
Wider.

480
00:40:26,846 --> 00:40:29,301
Okay.

481
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:32,597
Oh God.

482
00:40:32,685 --> 00:40:34,512
How do they
expect me to...

483
00:40:34,603 --> 00:40:37,177
Would you rather just have
the laughing gas?

484
00:40:37,273 --> 00:40:39,514
- Yeah.
- Okay.

485
00:40:39,608 --> 00:40:41,435
Jean, I'm going
to need you in here.

486
00:40:44,029 --> 00:40:46,235
You'll have to speak up,
there's too much noise.

487
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:51,279
What?!
I can't hear you!

488
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,446
Excuse me, what?!

489
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:57,536
Yes, the sixth at 2:00 P.M.

490
00:40:57,626 --> 00:41:00,295
Jean! Let me
get this started.

491
00:41:02,422 --> 00:41:04,165
Tim, you'll be awake,
a little groggy,

492
00:41:04,257 --> 00:41:06,380
but you're not going
to be able to move much.

493
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,984
Okay, great, thanks.
Alright, turn around.

494
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:37,328
The cleaning lady said they're at
the Ellis Medical Complex off of 14th.

495
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:44,044
God damn it anyway.

496
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:53,509
- Okay, I got it.
- I can't find a box!

497
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:57,348
Not again. Careful.

498
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:40,384
There we go.

499
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:51,727
Jean,
how's Tim doing in there?

500
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:58,533
What did he say
about your tooth?

501
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,907
- Did he say...
- I can't remember.

502
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:02,656
- Nora!
- The pigeons!

503
00:43:02,748 --> 00:43:04,989
What? Pigeons?

504
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:08,786
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Kid, kid!

505
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,588
- No-oo!
- Tim!

506
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:13,872
Look out!

507
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,043
- Stay back, stay back!
- No! Please, no!

508
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,652
Nora's not coming.
She won't leave her son.

509
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:42,691
- No, but she's next...
- Right now I don't think she cares.

510
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,963
This is really
happening again, isn't it?

511
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:08,267
I hoped we'd get there

512
00:44:08,353 --> 00:44:10,262
and they'd be fine,

513
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:12,597
and Clear Rivers
was just full of shit,

514
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:16,475
and Evan Lewis' death
was just some freak accident.

515
00:44:18,488 --> 00:44:20,646
But we're all going to die,
aren't we?

516
00:44:24,994 --> 00:44:26,987
I'm so scared.

517
00:44:28,414 --> 00:44:30,952
I know you didn't ask
for any of this...

518
00:44:32,126 --> 00:44:34,700
but I don't think you have it
in you to quit either.

519
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:44,970
A second one just died.

520
00:44:45,056 --> 00:44:46,847
A 15-year-old kid.

521
00:44:48,851 --> 00:44:51,009
I hope you're ready for this.

522
00:45:02,656 --> 00:45:04,150
It's this way.

523
00:45:06,493 --> 00:45:08,949
How is this guy going
to help us anyway?

524
00:45:09,037 --> 00:45:11,445
He seemed to know
a hell of a lot more

525
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,497
about Death
than he ever told us.

526
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:19,628
Shouldn't we knock first?

527
00:45:19,714 --> 00:45:22,003
He probably already knows
we're coming.

528
00:46:09,304 --> 00:46:11,297
Hello, Clear.

529
00:46:17,312 --> 00:46:19,055
I've been expecting you.

530
00:46:19,147 --> 00:46:21,104
Oh my God.

531
00:46:22,692 --> 00:46:25,397
- That's Evan Lewis.
- Come to pick my brain?

532
00:46:25,487 --> 00:46:28,653
Just a simple question and we'll leave you
alone with your new friend.

533
00:46:30,325 --> 00:46:32,282
Dead...

534
00:46:32,368 --> 00:46:35,155
yet still fresh.

535
00:46:36,581 --> 00:46:38,620
Look, we drove
a long way to get here,

536
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:40,747
so if you happen to know
how to stop Death,

537
00:46:40,835 --> 00:46:42,578
it would be really great
if you told us.

538
00:46:43,671 --> 00:46:45,296
You can't cheat Death.

539
00:46:45,381 --> 00:46:48,133
- There are no escapes.
- Bullshit.

540
00:46:48,217 --> 00:46:51,088
You told me Death
has a distinct design.

541
00:46:51,178 --> 00:46:54,464
But Alex and I cheated Death,
not once but dozens of times.

542
00:46:54,557 --> 00:46:57,012
The design is flawed,
it can be beaten.

543
00:46:57,101 --> 00:46:59,805
Such fire in you now.

544
00:46:59,895 --> 00:47:02,469
People are always
most alive

545
00:47:02,564 --> 00:47:04,272
just before they die.

546
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:06,101
Don't you think?

547
00:47:22,959 --> 00:47:24,240
Look, please...

548
00:47:30,675 --> 00:47:33,961
if you know of anything
that could help us,

549
00:47:34,053 --> 00:47:36,011
what harm could it do?

550
00:47:37,056 --> 00:47:40,556
Only new life
can defeat Death.

551
00:47:40,643 --> 00:47:42,766
What the hell
does that mean?

552
00:47:44,689 --> 00:47:47,180
Some people say there's a balance
to everything.

553
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:50,150
For every life
there's a death,

554
00:47:50,236 --> 00:47:52,478
and for every death
there is a life.

555
00:47:52,571 --> 00:47:55,323
But the introduction of life
that was not meant to be,

556
00:47:55,408 --> 00:47:57,780
that can
invalidate the list,

557
00:47:57,868 --> 00:48:01,154
force Death
to start anew.

558
00:48:09,129 --> 00:48:11,585
You have to follow
the signs...

559
00:48:11,673 --> 00:48:13,500
Kimberly.

560
00:48:15,802 --> 00:48:17,795
How do you know my name?

561
00:48:31,735 --> 00:48:34,023
- Whoa!
- Wait a second.

562
00:48:34,112 --> 00:48:37,113
'New life defeats death'?
'Follow the signs'?

563
00:48:37,198 --> 00:48:39,107
Where did you
find that guy?

564
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,944
I thought he was supposed
to help us,

565
00:48:41,035 --> 00:48:42,446
not freak us out.

566
00:48:47,667 --> 00:48:49,291
What the fuck
are you thinking?!

567
00:48:51,337 --> 00:48:54,623
I'm thinking suck on my junk,
bee-atch.

568
00:48:54,715 --> 00:48:56,507
Little punk.

569
00:49:08,604 --> 00:49:10,395
What is it?

570
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:12,853
What did you see?

571
00:49:26,371 --> 00:49:28,494
You have to tell us,
what did you see?

572
00:49:28,582 --> 00:49:30,740
Kimberly, look at me!
You have to tell us.

573
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,957
What did you see?!

574
00:49:36,131 --> 00:49:37,922
I was driving a white van.

575
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:40,333
I don't know,
I must have lost control,

576
00:49:40,427 --> 00:49:42,253
because I crashed
into a lake.

577
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:44,468
- And I drowned.
- You were there?

578
00:49:44,556 --> 00:49:47,473
I can practically taste
the water in my mouth.

579
00:49:50,645 --> 00:49:52,436
Wait, remember, the on-ramp?

580
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:55,191
There was a pregnant woman
in a white delivery van.

581
00:49:55,274 --> 00:49:58,608
He said only new life
can defeat death.

582
00:50:00,154 --> 00:50:01,648
If she gives birth
to a baby

583
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:03,696
that would've died
in that car crash...

584
00:50:03,783 --> 00:50:06,404
a brand new soul that was never part
of Death's design...

585
00:50:06,494 --> 00:50:08,071
It throws the whole list
out of whack

586
00:50:08,162 --> 00:50:10,368
and we start over
with a clean slate.

587
00:50:10,456 --> 00:50:13,457
- It seems like a reach, don't you think?
- What else could it mean?

588
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:15,618
We have to find
the pregnant lady's number.

589
00:50:15,711 --> 00:50:17,086
I don't have it.
She never came to the station.

590
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:21,334
We have to warn her about the lake
so she can stay alive to have the baby.

591
00:50:21,425 --> 00:50:24,544
- That'll be an easy conversation to have.
- How are we gonna find her?

592
00:50:24,636 --> 00:50:26,214
There could be thousands
of white vans in the state.

593
00:50:26,305 --> 00:50:27,549
Hey!

594
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,431
I'm a cop, remember?

595
00:50:33,895 --> 00:50:35,473
Wait, that's it.

596
00:50:38,483 --> 00:50:40,274
Got it.

597
00:50:42,529 --> 00:50:44,817
With the plate number
I can put out an APB.

598
00:50:44,906 --> 00:50:46,982
Here we go.

599
00:50:47,075 --> 00:50:48,984
The vehicle
is a delivery van

600
00:50:49,077 --> 00:50:51,484
registered to Marcus
and Isabella Hudson.

601
00:50:52,705 --> 00:50:54,828
We should pick them up
pretty quickly.

602
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:56,742
Come on, let's get
to the meeting.

603
00:51:11,515 --> 00:51:13,342
Hey, hold the door!

604
00:51:14,727 --> 00:51:16,684
Hey, let go of my shoe!

605
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:18,514
Give me my shoe!

606
00:51:24,528 --> 00:51:27,564
I wrote to management two weeks ago
about these friggin' bumpers.

607
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:31,691
Is that dogshit, dude?

608
00:51:34,871 --> 00:51:36,615
Eww.

609
00:51:41,878 --> 00:51:44,036
Oh, you got something
on your...

610
00:51:47,175 --> 00:51:50,378
It's still there, bro'.
Here, I can get it for you.

611
00:51:51,512 --> 00:51:53,422
No, it's alright.

612
00:51:55,058 --> 00:51:57,549
I'll do it
if you want me to do it.

613
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,771
Just let... I'll...
Let me do it.

614
00:52:04,817 --> 00:52:06,644
What?

615
00:52:07,903 --> 00:52:09,695
Hey, man,
how you doing?

616
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,987
Listen, any word
on that white van yet?

617
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:15,652
Okay, keep checking.

618
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:27,629
Does anybody have a Valium?

619
00:52:27,714 --> 00:52:29,624
Oh, yeah.

620
00:52:29,716 --> 00:52:31,460
Here.

621
00:52:31,551 --> 00:52:33,959
You're just going to want to take
half of that.

622
00:52:34,054 --> 00:52:35,548
Keep 'em coming.

623
00:52:38,308 --> 00:52:39,968
If what you're saying is true,

624
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,637
that means I'm next.

625
00:52:41,728 --> 00:52:44,301
This is crazy, people, come on.

626
00:52:44,397 --> 00:52:46,473
First Death
is stalking us,

627
00:52:46,566 --> 00:52:48,938
and now premonitions?
What?

628
00:52:49,027 --> 00:52:50,687
You're not next, Nora.

629
00:52:50,779 --> 00:52:54,029
Nobody has to be next.
That's the point.

630
00:52:54,115 --> 00:52:57,282
We need to help each other
in order to get through this.

631
00:52:57,368 --> 00:52:58,993
This cannot be happening.

632
00:52:59,078 --> 00:53:00,822
See, because my career
is at a peak

633
00:53:00,913 --> 00:53:02,953
and I finally met
a quality guy.

634
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,618
I just bought a house.

635
00:53:04,709 --> 00:53:06,748
Maybe if you shut the fuck up,
you'll live.

636
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:10,163
Like I'm going
to take advice from you.

637
00:53:10,256 --> 00:53:12,961
Okay, look,
if you know what to look for,

638
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:14,628
you have a fighting chance.

639
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:18,134
If I call and say,
I don't know... subway...

640
00:53:18,222 --> 00:53:20,511
Get to a high-rise fast.

641
00:53:22,518 --> 00:53:25,637
A place where no subway
could ever possibly go.

642
00:53:25,729 --> 00:53:27,686
Get it?

643
00:53:30,526 --> 00:53:33,147
Okay, you guys, listen...

644
00:53:33,237 --> 00:53:35,313
just because Kimberly
has these visions,

645
00:53:35,405 --> 00:53:37,149
it doesn't mean
we're not all capable

646
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,984
of seeing signs
to some extent.

647
00:53:39,076 --> 00:53:40,783
Okay, okay, look.

648
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:42,328
I gotta call bullshit.

649
00:53:42,412 --> 00:53:44,156
I mean, I've sat here
and listened

650
00:53:44,247 --> 00:53:46,156
to all your theories
and all your stories,

651
00:53:46,249 --> 00:53:48,289
and I think it's just
all bullshit.

652
00:53:48,376 --> 00:53:50,084
Call it what you want!

653
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:53,005
- It'll keep your arse alive.
- Darlin', my arse is alive!

654
00:53:53,089 --> 00:53:54,998
Has been all day.

655
00:53:56,217 --> 00:53:58,506
There is nobody after us
but you,

656
00:53:58,595 --> 00:54:00,801
trying to make us all crazy.

657
00:54:14,986 --> 00:54:16,693
I should have seen that coming.

658
00:54:16,779 --> 00:54:18,321
Yeah.

659
00:54:18,406 --> 00:54:20,647
If Death is out to get you,

660
00:54:20,741 --> 00:54:22,781
why don't you get
the hell away from us?

661
00:54:22,868 --> 00:54:24,991
She's the only one that's
dealt with this before.

662
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:27,118
We need to look out
for each other from now on.

663
00:54:27,206 --> 00:54:28,748
Sleep in shifts.

664
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:31,204
We need to safe-proof
this death-trap.

665
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,800
Get you to step out
of the van, miss?

666
00:54:42,888 --> 00:54:44,880
Are you kidding me?

667
00:54:44,973 --> 00:54:48,093
- What did I do?
- This vehicle's been reported stolen.

668
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,309
Ohh!

669
00:54:52,397 --> 00:54:54,639
Screw this.
I'm going for a smoke.

670
00:54:54,733 --> 00:54:57,306
No, no, no,
it's not safe out there.

671
00:54:57,402 --> 00:54:59,975
So, Nora's got
to bite it before me anyhow, huh?

672
00:55:00,071 --> 00:55:03,072
Oh, you people have
no sense of humor.

673
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:12,114
Nora, you okay?

674
00:55:14,126 --> 00:55:16,415
Four years ago
my husband died.

675
00:55:17,463 --> 00:55:19,586
Now Tim.
There's nothing left for me.

676
00:55:19,674 --> 00:55:21,583
Don't say that, okay?

677
00:55:21,675 --> 00:55:24,249
If it is my time to go
and be in heaven...

678
00:55:24,345 --> 00:55:26,918
with my family,
I can accept that.

679
00:55:27,014 --> 00:55:30,762
You got to trust me.
We can fight this.

680
00:55:30,851 --> 00:55:32,760
If we just stick
together long enough

681
00:55:32,853 --> 00:55:34,431
for her
to have her baby...

682
00:55:34,521 --> 00:55:36,977
If you'll excuse me,
I have a funeral to plan.

683
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,810
Nora.

684
00:55:42,654 --> 00:55:44,446
What do you think
you're doing?

685
00:55:44,531 --> 00:55:47,104
- I'm finished. I'm out.
- Don't leave, Eugene.

686
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,110
Look, look.

687
00:55:49,202 --> 00:55:51,242
I control my life, alright?

688
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:54,247
Not some crazy list that
Death has put together.

689
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,658
I'll be sure to carve
that into your tombstone.

690
00:55:57,752 --> 00:56:00,326
Whatever. You may be able
to scare these people,

691
00:56:00,422 --> 00:56:02,747
- I'm not buying that shit.
- Be careful, man.

692
00:56:02,841 --> 00:56:04,418
- Hey.
- What?

693
00:56:04,509 --> 00:56:07,629
Even if you don't believe,
give this to Nora.

694
00:56:18,648 --> 00:56:20,474
I'm just going
to put this in the...

695
00:56:21,651 --> 00:56:23,358
closet.

696
00:56:52,597 --> 00:56:54,471
Sorry.

697
00:57:10,823 --> 00:57:12,781
Whoa.

698
00:57:22,793 --> 00:57:24,786
Man with hooks?

699
00:57:25,963 --> 00:57:27,755
Man with hooks.

700
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,248
Hey, I think I see
a man with hooks.

701
00:57:32,052 --> 00:57:33,630
Is that...

702
00:57:35,139 --> 00:57:37,013
- a sign?
- Oh my God.

703
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:38,759
- Do you guys see that?
- He's right.

704
00:57:38,851 --> 00:57:40,261
- The phone.
- Shit.

705
00:58:01,414 --> 00:58:03,288
What the fuck?

706
00:58:13,801 --> 00:58:15,379
- Hello?
- Nora!

707
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:18,387
- Who is this?
- Can you hear me?!

708
00:58:18,473 --> 00:58:21,177
Officer Burke,
I can't...

709
00:58:21,267 --> 00:58:22,892
I can't hear you!
What?!

710
00:58:22,977 --> 00:58:24,175
What does he...
What?!

711
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:26,393
A man with hooks
is going to kill you.

712
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,939
- What, what?
- Oh...

713
00:58:28,024 --> 00:58:29,684
What is it, Nora?

714
00:58:32,278 --> 00:58:33,736
No!

715
00:58:33,821 --> 00:58:36,110
- Wait, wait!
- Let go!

716
00:58:36,198 --> 00:58:38,072
Wait, wait, Nora!

717
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:40,151
- Get me out of here!
- Will you stop it?!

718
00:58:40,244 --> 00:58:41,572
Let me help!

719
00:58:41,662 --> 00:58:43,037
Let me go!

720
00:58:50,379 --> 00:58:52,585
Let go of me!

721
00:58:59,513 --> 00:59:01,422
Kat!

722
00:59:12,609 --> 00:59:14,518
Help me!

723
00:59:14,611 --> 00:59:17,184
- Wait!
- I don't want to die!

724
00:59:29,959 --> 00:59:31,916
Aah!
Let me out of here.

725
00:59:34,088 --> 00:59:36,081
I got it, thanks.
They found the van.

726
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:39,091
Isabella's being held at
the Greenwood Lake sheriff's station.

727
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:41,418
I'm in control of my life!

728
00:59:41,512 --> 00:59:43,754
- Kiss my arse!
- Eugene, what is it?

729
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:45,805
- I control my life!
- What happened, Eugene?

730
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:48,596
- You hear me, you Reaper cocksucker?!
- Calm down.

731
00:59:48,686 --> 00:59:51,011
- What happened? Where's Nora?
- Back the fuck up!

732
00:59:51,105 --> 00:59:53,975
- Whoa, whoa, okay!
- Back the fuck up!

733
00:59:54,066 --> 00:59:56,521
Eugene, what's wrong?
Just tell us what happened.

734
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:58,649
Alright, give me
the gun, Eugene.

735
00:59:58,737 --> 01:00:00,943
- Give me the gun.
- No! Fuck no!

736
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:04,115
Eugene, you just got
to relax, bro', okay?

737
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:06,240
You just got
to calm down, man.

738
01:00:06,328 --> 01:00:08,154
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Eugene!

739
01:00:08,246 --> 01:00:11,164
- No, no, no, no!
- Don't do it! Don't do it!

740
01:00:11,249 --> 01:00:13,325
- I ain't going out like that.
- Hey, Eugene, no!

741
01:00:13,418 --> 01:00:16,123
- On my terms!
- Oh my God!

742
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:18,039
You hear me!

743
01:00:18,131 --> 01:00:21,085
God!

744
01:00:29,934 --> 01:00:31,891
Oh!

745
01:00:31,978 --> 01:00:33,388
You don't keep it loaded?

746
01:00:34,855 --> 01:00:37,560
- Maybe they're all duds.
- Six in a row?

747
01:00:38,859 --> 01:00:40,816
Never.
That's impossible.

748
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:43,192
It wasn't his turn to die.

749
01:00:44,698 --> 01:00:47,368
Can we find
the pregnant woman, now, please?

750
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,576
Is this safe, guys?

751
01:00:56,668 --> 01:00:59,124
I mean, someone in this car
is about to get whacked.

752
01:00:59,213 --> 01:01:01,668
Do the rest of us really feel
like sitting next to him?

753
01:01:01,757 --> 01:01:03,630
Or her?

754
01:01:04,968 --> 01:01:06,628
Hopefully her.

755
01:01:07,888 --> 01:01:09,761
Okay, guys,
let's not panic.

756
01:01:09,848 --> 01:01:12,469
- Isabella's safe.
- How do you know?

757
01:01:13,685 --> 01:01:15,927
You said she was going
to drive into a lake.

758
01:01:16,021 --> 01:01:18,856
How can she if she's
in protective custody?

759
01:01:26,489 --> 01:01:28,067
Look at me.

760
01:01:28,157 --> 01:01:30,150
Come on.

761
01:01:30,243 --> 01:01:32,282
Does it look like
I'm in the condition

762
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:34,777
to commit grand theft auto?
This is insane.

763
01:01:34,872 --> 01:01:36,781
Look, hopefully
the district judge

764
01:01:36,874 --> 01:01:39,792
will have it all sorted out
by Monday morning, okay?

765
01:01:46,342 --> 01:01:48,299
Marcus.

766
01:01:48,385 --> 01:01:50,959
Marcus, Marcus.

767
01:01:51,055 --> 01:01:53,296
When I get out of here,
I am going to sue his...

768
01:01:55,351 --> 01:01:58,268
- Oh my God.
- What, what now?

769
01:01:58,353 --> 01:02:00,311
My water just broke.

770
01:02:00,397 --> 01:02:02,306
- What?
- My water, it just broke.

771
01:02:02,399 --> 01:02:05,104
- I'm gonna have my baby.
- No, not here.

772
01:02:05,193 --> 01:02:08,111
- No, you can't do this to me.
- Don't just stand there!

773
01:02:08,196 --> 01:02:11,281
- Get me to a hospital!
- Give me a second to think!

774
01:02:11,366 --> 01:02:14,616
I am not going to have my baby
in a jail cell!

775
01:02:14,703 --> 01:02:16,363
Get me to the hospital!

776
01:02:16,454 --> 01:02:18,328
Okay, okay!

777
01:02:18,415 --> 01:02:21,499
Sheriff Perry,
this is Deputy Adams, come back.

778
01:02:22,836 --> 01:02:25,374
God, I need the car!
Sheriff Perry, I need the car!

779
01:02:25,463 --> 01:02:27,670
My van! My van!
Take my van!

780
01:02:30,009 --> 01:02:31,634
Okay. Okay.

781
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:33,795
Yeah, we'll go.
We'll go.

782
01:02:33,888 --> 01:02:35,845
Yeah, we'll go.

783
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:41,262
Come on,
come on!

784
01:02:46,025 --> 01:02:48,516
Y'all want to hear
something crazy?

785
01:02:48,611 --> 01:02:50,687
It's not the first time
I cheated Death.

786
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:56,152
A kid came to school
with a knife...

787
01:02:56,243 --> 01:02:58,035
killed his teacher.

788
01:02:59,872 --> 01:03:01,995
Teacher would have
been me,

789
01:03:02,082 --> 01:03:05,747
but I was transferred to another
school two days before.

790
01:03:05,836 --> 01:03:07,959
That's fucking weird, man.

791
01:03:08,046 --> 01:03:09,375
You want weird?

792
01:03:09,464 --> 01:03:11,540
Last year my partner and I
were heading out

793
01:03:11,633 --> 01:03:13,709
when a call came in
about a train wreck.

794
01:03:13,802 --> 01:03:16,044
Frank decided
to let me handle it alone.

795
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:20,262
He died that night
in a shootout.

796
01:03:21,476 --> 01:03:24,596
If that call had come in
just 10 seconds later,

797
01:03:24,688 --> 01:03:26,395
I'd be dead, too.

798
01:03:26,481 --> 01:03:28,604
Oh my God.

799
01:03:28,691 --> 01:03:30,601
I'm sorry.

800
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:32,318
It's just I got one, too.

801
01:03:32,403 --> 01:03:34,526
Okay, so last May
I'm supposed to go and stay

802
01:03:34,614 --> 01:03:37,283
at this cheesy little
bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania.

803
01:03:37,367 --> 01:03:40,284
Anyhow, there's this major gas leak
that no one knows about,

804
01:03:40,369 --> 01:03:42,777
and all the guests suffocated
during the night.

805
01:03:42,872 --> 01:03:44,152
So what happened?

806
01:03:44,248 --> 01:03:45,826
I don't know.
I never made it.

807
01:03:45,917 --> 01:03:48,621
The bus I was on splattered
some girl all over the road.

808
01:03:48,711 --> 01:03:50,122
Was that in Mt Abraham?

809
01:03:50,212 --> 01:03:53,628
Yes. How did you know?

810
01:03:53,716 --> 01:03:56,337
That bus you were on killed
Terry Chaney.

811
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,008
She was supposed to die
on Flight 180.

812
01:04:03,058 --> 01:04:05,929
Hey, do you guys remember
that theatre in Paris

813
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:08,807
that collapsed last year
and killed everybody inside?

814
01:04:10,649 --> 01:04:12,938
Well, I had tickets to go.

815
01:04:13,026 --> 01:04:15,434
But one night I'm in Paris

816
01:04:15,529 --> 01:04:18,779
and I'm just
tripping on acid

817
01:04:18,865 --> 01:04:21,107
and sipping lattes and such.

818
01:04:21,201 --> 01:04:23,028
And then all of a sudden

819
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:26,286
this dude out of nowhere

820
01:04:26,373 --> 01:04:28,780
just gets whacked
by this falling sign.

821
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:31,627
- Carter.
- Wait, wait, wait.

822
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:34,284
The teacher I replaced,
her name was Val Lewton.

823
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:37,298
She was from Mt Abraham.
She died in an explosion.

824
01:04:37,383 --> 01:04:40,301
Shit. The call about
the train wreck

825
01:04:40,386 --> 01:04:41,964
that saved my life...

826
01:04:42,055 --> 01:04:44,462
that was the night
I scraped up Billy Hitchcock.

827
01:04:44,557 --> 01:04:47,013
Wait a minute.
Who are these people?

828
01:04:48,519 --> 01:04:50,512
The people who got off
of Flight 180.

829
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:54,348
They were my friends.

830
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:00,109
Kimberly,
tell us what happened.

831
01:05:03,284 --> 01:05:06,403
About a year ago my mum and I
were at the mall.

832
01:05:06,495 --> 01:05:08,404
I was supposed
to meet her outside,

833
01:05:08,497 --> 01:05:11,070
but I got caught up watching
this news report

834
01:05:11,166 --> 01:05:13,040
about some kid
that committed suicide.

835
01:05:14,461 --> 01:05:16,252
I kept thinking,

836
01:05:16,338 --> 01:05:18,710
'How can you strangle yourself
in the bathtub?

837
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:20,625
That's stupid.'

838
01:05:23,303 --> 01:05:25,260
It felt wrong.

839
01:05:25,347 --> 01:05:27,138
And yet...

840
01:05:30,143 --> 01:05:33,429
I heard some gunshots
and I ran outside.

841
01:05:35,482 --> 01:05:38,103
Some kids were trying
to steal my mum's car.

842
01:05:38,193 --> 01:05:40,766
She tried to fight them off,
she was a fighter,

843
01:05:40,862 --> 01:05:42,938
and they killed her.

844
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:48,155
After the funeral I kept thinking that
it should have been me.

845
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:51,656
I guess everyone must
think that.

846
01:05:53,291 --> 01:05:55,330
But I guess I was right.

847
01:06:04,468 --> 01:06:07,552
Get there.
Could you drive a little faster maybe?!

848
01:06:07,638 --> 01:06:09,381
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- God!

849
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,723
When we got off
Flight 180,

850
01:06:13,811 --> 01:06:16,728
it didn't just change
our lives.

851
01:06:16,814 --> 01:06:19,221
It affected everyone
and everything

852
01:06:19,316 --> 01:06:21,558
we've come
into contact with since.

853
01:06:21,652 --> 01:06:23,561
I'm not sure
I'm understanding you.

854
01:06:23,653 --> 01:06:26,061
Being alive after
we were supposed to die,

855
01:06:26,156 --> 01:06:28,232
it caused an outward ripple.

856
01:06:28,325 --> 01:06:30,198
A rift in Death's design.

857
01:06:30,285 --> 01:06:33,286
So if you had never
gotten off the plane...

858
01:06:34,789 --> 01:06:36,912
we wouldn't be alive
in the first place.

859
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,538
Yes, that's why Death
is working backwards!

860
01:06:39,627 --> 01:06:41,750
It's tying up
all the loose ends,

861
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:44,127
Sealing the rift once
and for all.

862
01:07:06,112 --> 01:07:07,522
Oh, shit!

863
01:07:09,615 --> 01:07:11,239
Jesus Christ!

864
01:07:13,869 --> 01:07:15,826
Hang on! Hang on!

865
01:07:35,974 --> 01:07:38,299
- Is everybody alright?
- Oh God.

866
01:07:40,645 --> 01:07:42,353
God, Eugene!

867
01:07:42,439 --> 01:07:45,558
- He can't breathe.
- Oh, my legs!

868
01:07:48,486 --> 01:07:50,111
No, please.

869
01:07:50,196 --> 01:07:52,983
- It's not going to wait.
- I got to go help those people.

870
01:07:53,074 --> 01:07:55,280
Do you want to deliver
this baby?

871
01:07:56,869 --> 01:07:59,704
Those people can help.
Let's go.

872
01:08:01,332 --> 01:08:03,704
Officer Adams reporting
a vehicle collision

873
01:08:03,793 --> 01:08:05,869
off 9-A
at the 180 mile-marker.

874
01:08:05,961 --> 01:08:07,788
Send all emergency vehicles
to the scene.

875
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,916
- We have to go. Go!
- Okay, okay, okay!

876
01:08:11,008 --> 01:08:13,677
Just... okay, okay!
We're going! We're going!

877
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:18,346
- Easy, easy.
- Here, here, here.

878
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:20,638
I think he has
a collapsed lung.

879
01:08:20,726 --> 01:08:23,264
- Everyone okay?
- Call an ambulance!

880
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:30,683
Stay with us.

881
01:08:30,777 --> 01:08:32,153
Hey, hey you!

882
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:36,235
Hey! Come on.
Help me out.

883
01:08:36,324 --> 01:08:39,907
You got to get me out of here before
this thing explodes or something, okay?

884
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:44,200
I think it's okay.

885
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:46,579
I don't smell any gas
and nothing's dripping.

886
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:49,419
Alright, get this thing off me.
Just pull. Hurry.

887
01:08:49,504 --> 01:08:51,627
Okay. Be careful.
Ready?

888
01:08:53,132 --> 01:08:56,086
Oh God, Jethro!
Jesus Christ!

889
01:08:56,177 --> 01:08:58,419
I got to be able to use
my legs when I'm done.

890
01:08:58,513 --> 01:09:00,589
I'm so... Dad!

891
01:09:06,812 --> 01:09:08,390
Eugene, everything's
going to be okay.

892
01:09:08,481 --> 01:09:11,232
If he doesn't get a respirator,
he's not going to make it!

893
01:09:11,317 --> 01:09:14,234
We're going to get you to the hospital.
Be careful with that!

894
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,771
Check the gauges on the regulator,
and watch out for overdoses!

895
01:09:17,865 --> 01:09:20,949
- And look out for potholes and puddles.
- You can't come in, miss.

896
01:09:22,619 --> 01:09:24,861
And watch out
for power lines!

897
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:28,282
Watch it!

898
01:09:33,797 --> 01:09:36,253
You trying to get yourself killed,
little boy?

899
01:09:36,341 --> 01:09:38,630
You got to use
your head, man.

900
01:09:38,718 --> 01:09:40,426
Get that news van back.

901
01:09:40,512 --> 01:09:42,089
Thanks.

902
01:09:49,813 --> 01:09:51,473
Okay, let's go.

903
01:10:07,788 --> 01:10:10,161
How is she doing?

904
01:10:10,249 --> 01:10:12,325
I think she's going
to be okay.

905
01:10:15,171 --> 01:10:17,840
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

906
01:10:19,842 --> 01:10:21,799
When I die...

907
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:23,677
is it going to hurt?

908
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:27,007
I don't know.

909
01:10:28,517 --> 01:10:30,344
You're going to die after me, right?

910
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,347
Yeah, I guess so.

911
01:10:35,357 --> 01:10:37,350
Would you take these?

912
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:45,107
And if I die...

913
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,660
would you throw out
all my drugs

914
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:53,696
and my paraphernalia
and my porno?

915
01:10:56,044 --> 01:10:57,668
You know...

916
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:00,209
anything that's going
to break my mum's heart.

917
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,126
Please?

918
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,131
Thank you.

919
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:14,268
This is Cheyenne Jacobson

920
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,262
reporting live
from the Gibbons farm.

921
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,099
Sheriff Perry,
Officer Burke here.

922
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:20,764
I'm trying to get some
information on Isabella...

923
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,769
She did?

924
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:25,435
Okay. Thanks.
Great.

925
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:26,990
Kimberly!

926
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,695
Isabella's at Lakeview Hospital.
They're prepping her for delivery.

927
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,694
- We got to go now.
- What about Kat?

928
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,032
I'll go talk to her.

929
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,957
Hi.

930
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:38,579
Just find Isabella and get this thing
over with, okay?

931
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:40,412
Go on, I'll be fine.

932
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:49,336
- Where's Rory?
- I don't know.

933
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,262
Could you be a little quieter
with that thing, please?

934
01:11:56,352 --> 01:11:59,223
Yeah, sure.
I'll just put it on quiet mode.

935
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:00,689
That would be good.

936
01:12:28,884 --> 01:12:29,963
Rory.

937
01:12:46,026 --> 01:12:48,315
Oh my God!

938
01:12:48,403 --> 01:12:50,396
Somebody get out there!

939
01:12:50,489 --> 01:12:53,442
- We have to get to the hospital now!
- Well, take my truck!

940
01:12:53,533 --> 01:12:54,992
The keys are in it.

941
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:01,155
Kimberly!

942
01:13:12,343 --> 01:13:13,718
Kimberly!

943
01:13:13,803 --> 01:13:15,926
- Kimberly.
- What do you see?

944
01:13:16,013 --> 01:13:18,469
- What are we looking for?
- It's not here.

945
01:13:20,309 --> 01:13:22,266
This one was different.

946
01:13:22,353 --> 01:13:25,307
It was like the van crashing
into the lake.

947
01:13:25,398 --> 01:13:27,437
I was in a hospital,
there was screaming

948
01:13:27,525 --> 01:13:29,233
and a nurse was trying
to choke me.

949
01:13:29,318 --> 01:13:31,891
I couldn't see her,
but I could see her name tag.

950
01:13:31,987 --> 01:13:33,944
It was right in my face.
Kalarjian.

951
01:13:35,658 --> 01:13:38,861
I think a nurse named
Kalarjian is going to try and kill Isabella.

952
01:13:42,873 --> 01:13:45,790
Listen to me, Isabella!
I need you to stop pushing!

953
01:13:45,876 --> 01:13:47,370
What's wrong?
Is my baby alright?

954
01:13:47,461 --> 01:13:49,833
The cord's around the neck.
This baby's in trouble.

955
01:13:49,921 --> 01:13:52,792
A bizarre accident
has left two people dead,

956
01:13:52,883 --> 01:13:55,718
one of them killed
by a safety device meant to protect us.

957
01:13:55,802 --> 01:13:58,258
Ironically, the woman
was impaled through the head

958
01:13:58,346 --> 01:14:00,671
after her emergency airbag
deployed.

959
01:14:00,765 --> 01:14:04,348
She was trapped in her vehicle after it
crashed into a field near Greenwood Lake.

960
01:14:04,436 --> 01:14:06,843
Suddenly the airbag went off...

961
01:14:41,305 --> 01:14:43,381
Isabella Hudson!
What room is she in?

962
01:14:43,474 --> 01:14:45,550
We may need to do
a stat Caesarean!

963
01:14:45,642 --> 01:14:47,469
Get Dr. Kalarjian
up here now!

964
01:14:47,561 --> 01:14:50,230
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.

965
01:14:50,314 --> 01:14:51,724
I'm just going
to wait outside,

966
01:14:51,815 --> 01:14:53,772
'cause I'm just really
in the way here.

967
01:14:53,859 --> 01:14:55,768
- Don't you dare leave me!
- Okay, okay.

968
01:14:55,861 --> 01:14:57,604
You guys, get to Isabella!

969
01:14:57,696 --> 01:14:59,487
I'm going to find Eugene!

970
01:14:59,573 --> 01:15:02,739
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.

971
01:15:02,826 --> 01:15:05,780
Dr. Kalarjian, delivery room six.
Code blue.

972
01:15:21,469 --> 01:15:23,794
Dr. Kalarjian,
in here, hurry!

973
01:15:24,972 --> 01:15:27,095
That's her.

974
01:15:28,142 --> 01:15:29,720
Wait, wait, wait!

975
01:16:06,972 --> 01:16:09,297
Contractions have stopped.

976
01:16:09,391 --> 01:16:11,882
Arrest in descent halfway
through the birth canal.

977
01:16:11,976 --> 01:16:14,052
Bad tracing,
it's losing oxygen.

978
01:16:14,145 --> 01:16:16,221
The cord's compressed!

979
01:16:16,314 --> 01:16:19,599
- Down to 40.
- Oh God! What's happening?!

980
01:16:19,692 --> 01:16:21,400
Where's Kalarjian?!

981
01:16:21,486 --> 01:16:24,155
Dr. Kalarjian!

982
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:26,397
- Dr. Kalarjian!
- Not now, I'm busy.

983
01:16:26,491 --> 01:16:29,694
- Ow! Hey! Hey!
- Police business.

984
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:41,534
Just push a little more.

985
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:43,955
Oh, no.

986
01:16:44,049 --> 01:16:45,793
Isabella, is the baby okay?

987
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:48,593
I'm sorry.
You can't be here.

988
01:16:48,679 --> 01:16:51,252
- I have to ask you to leave.
- I need to know...

989
01:16:51,348 --> 01:16:54,219
I need to know if the baby's alright!

990
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:57,638
It's a boy.

991
01:17:18,416 --> 01:17:20,373
Thank you.
Congratulations!

992
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:22,417
Who the hell are they?

993
01:17:22,503 --> 01:17:24,876
Oh my God!

994
01:17:28,593 --> 01:17:30,419
- Clear.
- I can't find Eugene.

995
01:17:30,511 --> 01:17:33,216
- No, don't worry. She had the baby!
- It's okay.

996
01:17:33,306 --> 01:17:35,263
It's over.
It's okay.

997
01:17:48,779 --> 01:17:51,187
- Kimberly.
- What did you see?

998
01:17:51,281 --> 01:17:54,567
I don't think Isabella
was ever supposed to die in that pileup.

999
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:56,985
Then what's the premonition
of the lake supposed to mean?

1000
01:17:57,079 --> 01:17:58,906
Try to remember.

1001
01:18:16,264 --> 01:18:19,550
Bloody hands.
Someone with bloody hands.

1002
01:18:20,602 --> 01:18:22,012
Eugene.

1003
01:18:26,482 --> 01:18:29,567
Only new life defeats death.
What is that supposed to mean?

1004
01:18:29,652 --> 01:18:31,444
You saw an ECG machine
and what else?

1005
01:18:33,448 --> 01:18:35,606
Bloody hands.
What else did you see, Kimberly?

1006
01:18:36,659 --> 01:18:38,118
Wait.

1007
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:41,906
Eugene.

1008
01:19:02,059 --> 01:19:03,968
Oh God, no!

1009
01:19:14,237 --> 01:19:15,945
Bloody hands.

1010
01:19:17,741 --> 01:19:19,864
It's me.
The premonitions are about me.

1011
01:19:19,951 --> 01:19:22,027
- What?
- Crash cart.

1012
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,579
Let's go! Move it!

1013
01:19:25,874 --> 01:19:27,831
Dr. Kalarjian.

1014
01:19:27,917 --> 01:19:29,709
ECG machine.

1015
01:19:34,215 --> 01:19:35,875
The lake.

1016
01:19:35,967 --> 01:19:37,840
The white van.

1017
01:19:42,598 --> 01:19:44,425
What are you talking about?

1018
01:19:47,103 --> 01:19:48,929
New life.

1019
01:19:51,482 --> 01:19:53,225
What is it?

1020
01:19:53,317 --> 01:19:55,606
I know what I have
to do to save us.

1021
01:19:57,112 --> 01:20:00,066
- I have to die.
- No, that's crazy.

1022
01:20:00,157 --> 01:20:03,277
You can't give up now.
We have to fight this thing.

1023
01:20:07,956 --> 01:20:09,949
Get Kalarjian.

1024
01:22:35,475 --> 01:22:38,559
Only new life can defeat death.

1025
01:22:38,645 --> 01:22:41,396
If it is my time to go
and be in heaven...

1026
01:22:41,481 --> 01:22:43,806
with my family.
I can accept that.

1027
01:22:45,443 --> 01:22:47,103
Flight 180...

1028
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:49,436
I know what I have to do
to save us.

1029
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:51,606
There are no known survivors.

1030
01:22:51,699 --> 01:22:53,656
I have to die.

1031
01:22:55,202 --> 01:22:57,872
Ready and clear!

1032
01:22:58,914 --> 01:22:59,994
Nothing!

1033
01:23:02,918 --> 01:23:05,077
Ready and clear.

1034
01:23:06,589 --> 01:23:08,415
Nothing.

1035
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,208
- Come on.
- Ready, clear.

1036
01:23:12,302 --> 01:23:15,339
She's back!

1037
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:17,719
Epinephrine.
Two milligrams, IV push.

1038
01:23:17,808 --> 01:23:20,643
I want her prepped
and stabilized for ICU.

1039
01:23:24,773 --> 01:23:26,433
Welcome back.

1040
01:23:27,609 --> 01:23:29,685
They lost you
for a minute there.

1041
01:23:35,784 --> 01:23:39,034
Hey. We did it.

1042
01:23:40,121 --> 01:23:42,114
Thanks to you,
we cheated Death.

1043
01:24:14,613 --> 01:24:16,321
Would you like some wine?

1044
01:24:16,407 --> 01:24:18,529
I think I'll stick
to our beer, thanks.

1045
01:24:18,617 --> 01:24:19,945
Alright.

1046
01:24:20,035 --> 01:24:22,443
This is really great,
Mrs. Gibbons.

1047
01:24:22,538 --> 01:24:24,696
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

1048
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:26,699
It's our pleasure.

1049
01:24:27,959 --> 01:24:31,375
- How are you doing, Kimberly?
- Good. Yeah.

1050
01:24:31,463 --> 01:24:33,621
I had a fun summer.

1051
01:24:33,715 --> 01:24:37,001
I don't know, I guess things are
pretty much getting back to normal.

1052
01:24:39,763 --> 01:24:42,799
Brian, I think you better
go check that barbecue.

1053
01:24:42,891 --> 01:24:45,512
Hey, careful.
Those things are dangerous.

1054
01:24:45,602 --> 01:24:47,808
Trust me.
I think I've been through closer calls.

1055
01:24:47,896 --> 01:24:50,932
Yeah, me too. Dad, you should tell them
about the news van thing.

1056
01:24:51,024 --> 01:24:52,767
What's that?

1057
01:24:52,859 --> 01:24:56,109
Brian was almost hit by that
news van that day in the field.

1058
01:24:56,195 --> 01:24:58,865
And your friend Rory,
he pulled him back at the last second.

1059
01:24:58,948 --> 01:25:02,447
- Saved his life.
- You never told me that, Peter.

1060
01:25:02,535 --> 01:25:04,077
Boy, that was lucky.

1061
01:25:08,916 --> 01:25:11,241
Brian!
