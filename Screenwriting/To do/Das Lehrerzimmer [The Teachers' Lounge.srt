1
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:30,257
Yes, I understand.

2
00:00:34,507 --> 00:00:36,923
As I said, we had this last week...

3
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:43,216
Uh... One second.

4
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:49,837
Yes, I'm still here.

5
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:00,382
0153...

6
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,298
... 4. Yes.

7
00:01:08,912 --> 00:01:10,478
Yes, we'll keep in touch.

8
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:12,879
I've made a note of
everything and I'll take care of it.

9
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:14,341
Great. Talk soon.

10
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:32,565
- Hello, Ms. Nowak.
- Hi.

11
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,340
- Sorry for the delay.
- No problem.

12
00:01:50,716 --> 00:01:52,841
Mr. Liebenwerda has
outlined the topic.

13
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:55,340
Good. So you know what's going on?

14
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:58,465
Yes, but as I said,
we don't know anything.

15
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:02,298
It's not about what you
know, but about clues.

16
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:04,799
Have you noticed anything recently?

17
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:07,549
Are classmates behaving
conspicuously?

18
00:02:10,257 --> 00:02:12,923
I know the
situation is unpleasant.

19
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,382
Not just for you.

20
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:16,965
But put yourselves in the
shoes of the victims.

21
00:02:17,257 --> 00:02:19,882
We must put an end to this together.

22
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:22,424
Class representatives
bear responsibility.

23
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:24,966
What can we say? We know nothing.

24
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:28,632
Lukas?

25
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,090
Can't you think of anyone?

26
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:33,466
Does anyone have a new cell phone?

27
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:35,882
Or branded clothes? Bragging
about money?

28
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:37,840
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Hey.

29
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:39,965
You don't 
have to either.

30
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:43,341
That's right.
We don't have to talk at all.

31
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:48,340
Look.

32
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:56,466
I go down the list of
names with the pen and

33
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:59,299
all you have to do is nod
if you have a clue.

34
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:00,891
Yes?

35
00:03:08,257 --> 00:03:10,257
Liebenwerda?

36
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:14,715
You don't have to, of
course, if you don't want to.

37
00:03:14,924 --> 00:03:15,964
Yes?

38
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:19,590
But let me continue.
We're almost through.

39
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:26,257
This one?

40
00:03:26,424 --> 00:03:27,484
Here?

41
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,465
Great. Thank you, Lukas.

42
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:31,841
Okay.

43
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:38,007
A reminder: What is discussed
here remains between us.

44
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:40,091
- Yes?
- Okay.

45
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:42,174
- Yes?
- Yes.

46
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:53,923
People.

47
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:03,816
Good day, Good day...

48
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:15,548
I see all the books.

49
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:22,507
I see all the folders and notebooks.

50
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,299
Great. Please get your homework
out, I'm coming around.

51
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:33,632
And in the meantime, please watch
the warm-up. And stay quiet.

52
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:40,465
Good.

53
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:44,799
Yes, good.

54
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:47,007
Ali...

55
00:04:50,388 --> 00:04:52,804
Take another close look at number 2.

56
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:54,590
Phileas, will you explain it to him?

57
00:04:55,924 --> 00:05:00,257
You have to expand
to get to the same denominator.

58
00:05:00,757 --> 00:05:02,257
I see!

59
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:06,030
Hey!

60
00:05:08,056 --> 00:05:09,120
Okay.

61
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:11,132
Who would like to solve the warm-up?

62
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:15,590
Is 0.9 repeating the
same number as 1?

63
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:20,049
- Hatice, yes?
- Actually, it's not the same number.

64
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:21,257
Actually?

65
00:05:22,227 --> 00:05:26,320
Then please come to the
blackboard and show us why.

66
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:29,207
if you subtract 0.9 repeating from 1,

67
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:31,715
then a remainder is left over.

68
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:35,799
0.00... lots of zeros and then 1 .

69
00:05:36,257 --> 00:05:40,257
So you believe that there is still
a number between 0.9 repeating and 1 ?

70
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:41,677
Yes.

71
00:05:42,382 --> 00:05:45,382
What do you think? Is this
proof or an assertion?

72
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:55,629
Okay. Oskar would like to try.
Thank you, Hatice.

73
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:57,599
Nerd alert!

74
00:06:02,716 --> 00:06:05,716
So, 0.1 repeating...

75
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:08,049
is equal to one ninth.

76
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:14,882
And 9 times one
ninth equals 1.

77
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:18,257
So 0.9 repeating is

78
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:20,049
the same as 1 .

79
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:23,174
- What do you think?
- I don't get it.

80
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,924
There must be a gap between 0.9 and 1 .

81
00:06:27,257 --> 00:06:28,340
Thank you, Oskar.

82
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:31,382
Does anyone else not understand it?

83
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:36,216
Well, the task was a little
more demanding.

84
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:38,757
But the most important thing
you need to understand

85
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:42,507
is that a proof needs a derivation.
Step by step.

86
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:45,299
We'll get there. Yes, please?

87
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:48,485
Excuse me. I'll take over
for a moment, okay?

88
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:50,882
Hello everyone,

89
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:53,799
we have to interrupt the
lesson for a moment.

90
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:57,091
- Mr. Dudek?
- All girls please stand up.

91
00:06:57,257 --> 00:06:58,798
- Why?
- Stand up.

92
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:01,340
- Just get up.
- And now?

93
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:03,799
And now please leave the room.

94
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,549
Come on, get out.

95
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:07,132
Wait outside.

96
00:07:07,924 --> 00:07:08,924
Yes?

97
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:12,632
We'll get you in a minute.
Don't run away.

98
00:07:14,424 --> 00:07:15,424
Close the door.

99
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:19,799
Good. Everyone who is still
here is listening carefully.

100
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:23,048
We would like to look
into your wallets.

101
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:26,466
Please put them on the
table and come forward.

102
00:07:26,632 --> 00:07:29,340
- Do we have to do that?
- It's voluntary, of course.

103
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,840
But if you have nothing to hide,
you don't have to worry.

104
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:36,173
Take out your
wallet and come to the front.

105
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:37,507
What is this all about?

106
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:40,882
Were you not present
during the survey?

107
00:07:58,424 --> 00:07:59,590
Who is sitting here?

108
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:01,548
Oskar.

109
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:04,132
Oskar, where's your wallet?

110
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,995
- I don't have one.
- You don't have to show it, Oskar.

111
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:11,082
- I said I didn't have one.
- And this one?

112
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:17,799
Friends, whose seat is this?

113
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:21,549
Ms. Nowak?

114
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,549
That's Ali's seat.

115
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:28,007
Ali,
please come with me.

116
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:30,997
Come on.

117
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,924
I gave him money in
the morning to buy a present,

118
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:40,382
for his cousin.

119
00:08:40,597 --> 00:08:42,674
What kind of present?

120
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:44,674
For a computer game.

121
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:46,597
Right?

122
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:50,737
Yes, for a computer game.

123
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:56,924
Ali, Mrs. and Mr. Yilmaz,
I think we have clarity now

124
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:59,174
and can dismiss the matter.

125
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,632
What made you think of him?

126
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,966
- Excuse me?
- Why my Ali?

127
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:07,591
- He had a lot of money with him.
- So what?

128
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:10,674
What if I like to give
my child money?

129
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:11,954
Yes.

130
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:15,466
- Mrs. Yilmaz...
- Carrying money is not a criminal offense.

131
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:16,840
That's right.

132
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:21,257
We have what's called a
zero-tolerance policy at the school.

133
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:25,507
In short, this means that we
investigate everything.

134
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:32,382
But what do the others think now?
You know what children are like.

135
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:35,340
Don't worry.
We'll put it right.

136
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,340
- Right?
- Yes.

137
00:09:37,507 --> 00:09:40,465
We can be glad that the
suspicion was unfounded.

138
00:09:40,632 --> 00:09:42,438
Otherwise there
would be a big problem.

139
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:44,618
We're sorry that
you had to come.

140
00:09:44,891 --> 00:09:46,141
Yes, we are sorry.

141
00:10:02,464 --> 00:10:05,089
I would ask you to
please speak German.

142
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:11,299
German? Okay, then
I'll speak German.

143
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:15,227
My son does not steal. Never.

144
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:18,340
Because if he did,
I'd break his legs.

145
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:45,007
Ms. Nowak, the new substitution
plan is in your locker.

146
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:48,174
- Mrs. Holbach is ill.
- I know. Thank you, Ms. Kuhn.

147
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:50,299
... Nobody was frisked.
It was voluntary.

148
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:53,507
None of it was
voluntary. You know that.

149
00:10:53,674 --> 00:10:56,567
It would have been nice
to at least let me know.

150
00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:58,798
Why are you on
first name terms?

151
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:00,895
I understand your
indignation, but you

152
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:03,216
don't know how long
this has been going on.

153
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:06,079
Unfortunately, there are
people at school who steal

154
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:09,216
whatever they can get
their hands on for no reason.

155
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:11,882
We should seize the
opportunity and act.

156
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:14,382
Have the pencils reappeared?

157
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,799
- No.
- That's something like 1,000 pencils now.

158
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:19,049
Who needs 1,000 pencils?

159
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:23,007
Hasn't this started since
the new company started cleaning here?

160
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:25,299
Vanessa,
they're really nice.

161
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:27,591
What about a private investigator?

162
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:32,257
Then a guy with a pipe sits in the
schoolyard and convicts thieves?

163
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:35,466
- Just like in retail.
- I'll carry on.

164
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:39,090
"Act," isn't that right,
Mr. Liebenwerda?

165
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:53,465
Hands on your knees! One, two!

166
00:11:58,632 --> 00:12:01,340
On three we raise our arms and legs.

167
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:02,727
- Together?
- Yes.

168
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,048
One, two, three.

169
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:11,924
And those who can are welcome
to move around.

170
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,716
Come on,

171
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:22,257
Enno!

172
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:25,382
Nicely dribbled.

173
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:30,757
All good with you?

174
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:40,507
Great, Vera!

175
00:12:40,882 --> 00:12:42,465
Pass. Yes! Very good.

176
00:12:44,424 --> 00:12:45,799
Very good, Vera!

177
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:53,007
Hey! Hey, guys!

178
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,091
Good sportsmanship!

179
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:56,757
Ali, up. This is what happens.

180
00:12:56,924 --> 00:13:00,632
I can't stand it anymore.
Luise and Jieun do what they want.

181
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,049
Where are they anyway?

182
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:04,424
Calm down and keep playing, okay?

183
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:06,382
Not so bad. Let's move on.

184
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:12,965
Jenny, will you check on
Jieun and Luise please?

185
00:13:15,257 --> 00:13:17,173
But we can't play like that.

186
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:42,174
Great, Lukas.

187
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:48,539
Ruben, come here.

188
00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:51,472
Can you be the
ref? I'll be right back.

189
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,299
Jieun?

190
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:56,466
Luise?

191
00:14:22,674 --> 00:14:26,340
- Are you coming back in?
- We were just getting some fresh air.

192
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:29,173
Luise, what are you hiding
between your legs?

193
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:31,174
- Nothing.
- Come on, show me.

194
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,341
- Have you been smoking?
- No, we haven't.

195
00:14:38,507 --> 00:14:42,007
- Why the lighter?
- Um... To heat up the heroin.

196
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,891
- That's not funny.
- I think it is.

197
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,965
I thought you weren't feeling well.

198
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:50,340
- We were just catching our breath.
- That's right.

199
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,632
Okay. Everyone back inside.

200
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:04,174
What about my lighter?

201
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:07,007
That stays with me for the time being.
- For how long?

202
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:09,340
Until I speak to your parents.

203
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:11,507
Please don't do that.

204
00:15:12,685 --> 00:15:17,185
Fine by me. But sign out when you
leave the room in future, okay?

205
00:15:17,856 --> 00:15:19,856
- And the lighter?
- Got it?

206
00:15:19,882 --> 00:15:21,340
- Yes, Mrs. Nowak.
- Yes.

207
00:15:22,091 --> 00:15:23,124
Good.

208
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:25,757
You'll get the lighter
at the end of the day.

209
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:27,340
Now in with you.

210
00:15:41,093 --> 00:15:42,246
Hey, Oskar.

211
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:44,007
Hello.

212
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:49,132
This was in the gym.
It doesn't belong to my students.

213
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:52,882
Diary of someone named Steffi.
Unfortunately no surname.

214
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:55,549
Diary? Have you read it yet?

215
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:59,174
- I would never do that.
- Honestly? Me neither.

216
00:15:59,632 --> 00:16:02,882
I'm still having problems with
my email account.

217
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:06,757
- Could IT reset my password?
- Ms. Kuhn?

218
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,632
Fear not. Yes?

219
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,007
I need some tampons.

220
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:12,340
T or B?
- T please.

221
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:13,757
- And you?
- I'm good.

222
00:16:14,257 --> 00:16:15,673
- How many?
- Two.

223
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:21,993
Thank you.

224
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:23,518
- Bye.
- Bye.

225
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:28,674
- Ms. Kuhn?
- Yes?

226
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:32,382
- The password?
- I'm afraid I can't, unfortunately.

227
00:16:33,382 --> 00:16:36,340
- Why not?
- Because Mariam has already done it.

228
00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:38,632
- Ah!
- It's in your drawer.

229
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:41,174
You're great! Thank you.

230
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:43,841
- What?
- "You're great."

231
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:55,090
Are you ready yet?

232
00:17:57,966 --> 00:18:00,757
Do you want to check
the answers again?

233
00:18:01,507 --> 00:18:03,382
Can I go outside?

234
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:05,257
But stay quiet.

235
00:18:27,216 --> 00:18:28,757
- Tom.
- That's not mine.

236
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,141
That's your handwriting.

237
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:37,007
- Give me the test.
- No.

238
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:38,674
Give it to me.
- No.

239
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:40,154
He said it wasn't his.

240
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:41,274
Ali, quiet!

241
00:18:41,836 --> 00:18:42,895
Give it to me, come on.

242
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:44,923
No.

243
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:46,897
Tom.

244
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:50,882
Please continue.

245
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,299
Here.

246
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,507
Start again.
You have 20 minutes left.

247
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:06,673
- What should I do with it?
- Do it again. Otherwise it's a 6.

248
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:09,382
- The note isn't mine.
- Tom, it's not a discussion.

249
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:18,274
Please come to the front
and turn in your tests.

250
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:19,382
Thank you.

251
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:23,715
Tom, please stay here for a moment.

252
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:25,840
I'll wait outside.

253
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:28,715
So, Tom.

254
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:31,007
Your behavior was not okay.

255
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:32,965
What did I do?

256
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:37,632
You lied and talked back.
That distracted your classmates.

257
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:40,382
I looked at the cheat sheet.

258
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:44,882
If you take the trouble to make one, at
least write the right answers on it.

259
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:48,048
You copied your own errors
one-to-one onto the test.

260
00:19:48,216 --> 00:19:49,841
And that wasn't your note?

261
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,798
Do you want me to lie to you?

262
00:19:54,674 --> 00:19:56,132
Surely not, right?

263
00:19:57,507 --> 00:19:58,507
Tom.

264
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,132
What can I say to that?

265
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:05,799
I want you to understand that
your behavior is not fair.

266
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:08,341
Rules are for everyone, you know?

267
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:13,507
- Do you understand that, Tom?
- I do. I'm not stupid.

268
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,923
Anything else you want to tell me?

269
00:20:18,924 --> 00:20:20,757
- Sorry?
- "Sorry."

270
00:20:21,174 --> 00:20:22,882
Sorry is what you want
to hear, isn't it?

271
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:28,132
Can I go?

272
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:31,257
Yes, you can go.

273
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:39,632
We will let the parents know.

274
00:20:39,966 --> 00:20:41,216
All right, that's great.

275
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:43,559
When do you think you'll
have the list of participants?

276
00:20:43,716 --> 00:20:46,299
I hope to have it by the end
of next month, is that good for you?

277
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:48,382
Morning, Carla.

278
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:51,340
- One question.
- Hello.

279
00:20:51,507 --> 00:20:54,173
- You're in here already?
- Just a second.

280
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:56,424
- Yes
- Sorry,

281
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:59,841
I wanted to ask if we could talk
briefly about a student later?

282
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:01,024
Um, sure.

283
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:02,924
- It's about Ali.
- Again?

284
00:21:03,185 --> 00:21:04,859
It was already
close last semester.

285
00:21:04,883 --> 00:21:07,632
If he carries on like this,
he won't pass this year.

286
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:09,632
- Hey.
- Good morning.

287
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:12,799
- We're talking about Ali, Thomas.
- Oh yes, difficult.

288
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:14,174
Why difficult?

289
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:17,715
Just difficult.
I would say at risk of transfer.

290
00:21:17,882 --> 00:21:20,048
- Absolutely.
- Wait a minute. Uh, Tim?

291
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:24,215
We're going to have to catch up some
other time, I'm sorry.

292
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:25,507
Okay.

293
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,590
- Okay. 
- Enough done for the moment.

294
00:21:29,091 --> 00:21:32,091
- Is it about Ali's exams?
- Also that, yes.

295
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,507
- Also?
- Sorry.

296
00:21:33,674 --> 00:21:34,904
Bye, Tim.

297
00:21:36,632 --> 00:21:39,382
The semester has only
just begun. Um...

298
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,628
Have you spoken to the parents?

299
00:21:42,118 --> 00:21:46,201
- Not yet.
- Do you know what they do for a living?

300
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:49,632
- The father drives a cab, I think.
- What does that matter?

301
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,382
Perhaps he lacks someone
at home to support him.

302
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:55,549
- Oh, did you believe them?
- The parents?

303
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:56,785
Yes.

304
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,132
Is this about Ali's exams
or the thefts?

305
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,965
The thefts are just nonsense,
that doesn't matter at all.

306
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:07,548
Exactly. But to your question,
Vanessa: Yes, I believe them.

307
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:10,799
I believe they have integrity
and Ali doesn't steal.

308
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:14,549
It was a question,
Carla, just a simple question, okay?

309
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:15,799
All right, Vanessa.

310
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:18,341
Yes, they're all too
miffed for me here.

311
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:21,382
Thank you very much, Carla.

312
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:25,215
Then we can all go
back to our work.

313
00:24:55,643 --> 00:24:57,293
- Hey Carla.
- Hi.

314
00:25:06,268 --> 00:25:07,466
- Hey.
- Hey.

315
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,298
- I wanted to apologize.
- What do you mean?

316
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:15,245
The search of your class
was not in order.

317
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,548
That's okay. I'm over it.

318
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:23,257
And do me a favor:

319
00:25:23,632 --> 00:25:25,882
Let's speak German at work.

320
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:30,507
- Why? Are you ashamed?
- I'm not.

321
00:25:30,674 --> 00:25:33,382
I think it's better
for our colleagues.

322
00:25:35,257 --> 00:25:37,298
Fine, whatever.

323
00:25:39,132 --> 00:25:40,215
Thank you.

324
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:24,882
Ms. Kuhn, the printers
are on strike again.

325
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:28,965
Striking again? We'll probably have
to talk to the works council.

326
00:27:29,132 --> 00:27:30,423
Paper jam.

327
00:27:31,178 --> 00:27:34,844
Have you tried the flap on the right?
It's usually stuck there.

328
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,381
It's quick with you.

329
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:39,500
We'll take care of it
when we get the chance.

330
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:41,382
Thank you, Ms. Kuhn.

331
00:27:46,924 --> 00:27:49,757
He wants
us to do it for him.

332
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:55,160
Ms. Nowak.

333
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,673
- What can we do for you?
- Um...

334
00:27:58,924 --> 00:28:02,590
You know, Ms. Kuhn,
I have a huge problem.

335
00:28:03,632 --> 00:28:05,923
Yes, and how can we help?

336
00:28:06,924 --> 00:28:07,965
So...

337
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:11,007
How do I express this
elegantly? Hm...

338
00:28:13,882 --> 00:28:18,090
Excuse me, can I have a word
with Ms. Kuhn in private?

339
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,507
Yeah, sure. Shall I go out?

340
00:28:21,757 --> 00:28:24,923
Mariam, why don't you
look at the printer.

341
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:29,132
Apparently a degree in physics is
not enough to solve the problem.

342
00:28:31,674 --> 00:28:33,882
- Do you want to sit down?
- No thanks.

343
00:28:34,716 --> 00:28:39,731
So, Ms. Kuhn, I was in gym class and my
jacket was hanging in the staff room.

344
00:28:39,878 --> 00:28:41,007
I see.

345
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:44,715
- What about the jacket?
- The jacket is still there.

346
00:28:45,466 --> 00:28:47,049
So what's the problem?

347
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:52,132
In the jacket was my wallet
and in the wallet was...

348
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:55,340
... Money?
- Money, right. Yes.

349
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:56,632
Uh, was.

350
00:28:57,049 --> 00:28:59,174
You mean someone from the staff?

351
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:01,507
Why do you assume
it was the staff?

352
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:05,674
If the jacket was hanging in the staff
room, pupils are out of the question.

353
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:07,382
Come in!

354
00:29:07,882 --> 00:29:09,007
Ah, good.

355
00:29:13,507 --> 00:29:15,382
So who was there?

356
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,420
Thank you!

357
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,591
Liebenwerda was there,

358
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:26,715
Mrs. Semnik... Unfortunately,
I wasn't there the whole time.

359
00:29:28,091 --> 00:29:31,882
- Mariam, of course...
- Liebenwerda, Semnik, Mrs. Irfan.

360
00:29:33,591 --> 00:29:35,341
Do you think one of them
would do that?

361
00:29:37,716 --> 00:29:38,757
Ms. Kuhn.

362
00:29:39,382 --> 00:29:41,298
Do you have something to tell me?

363
00:29:41,716 --> 00:29:42,716
What?

364
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:46,882
Your blouse... I've never
seen it before.

365
00:29:48,257 --> 00:29:50,632
My blouse? What about my blouse?

366
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,882
Ms. Kuhn, this is very
unpleasant for me,

367
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:56,988
but there are clear indications
that it was you.

368
00:29:57,549 --> 00:29:59,299
That what was me?

369
00:30:03,757 --> 00:30:04,923
This is a joke.

370
00:30:05,091 --> 00:30:08,466
I don't want this to make waves.
Give the money back,

371
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:12,548
promise that this will stop and
we'll forget about it, okay?

372
00:30:16,007 --> 00:30:18,840
Are you actually serious? Really?

373
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:22,590
See it as an opportunity to get
the matter off the table.

374
00:30:22,757 --> 00:30:24,257
As an opportunity? The impudence!

375
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,299
Please leave now.

376
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:31,424
Please leave now.

377
00:30:36,841 --> 00:30:37,841
Get out!

378
00:30:42,656 --> 00:30:44,156
Uh, can I go back in?

379
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:10,507
Can I show you something?

380
00:31:18,507 --> 00:31:21,715
Ms. Kuhn, please follow
me to my office.

381
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:29,966
- Have you eaten?
- Let's do it together. Wait for me.

382
00:31:30,132 --> 00:31:32,298
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

383
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:34,840
Take a seat.

384
00:31:41,424 --> 00:31:45,132
Ms. Kuhn, I'm sure you can guess
what this is all about.

385
00:31:46,716 --> 00:31:48,507
Would you like to tell us something?

386
00:31:51,507 --> 00:31:54,173
This insinuation is
an absolute joke.

387
00:31:55,757 --> 00:31:59,840
Fine, but we have a problem and
we need to talk about it.

388
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:01,841
That is not an insinuation.

389
00:32:02,716 --> 00:32:03,882
Well, yes.

390
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:06,549
Because... do you have proof?

391
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:12,007
Give me that.

392
00:32:15,132 --> 00:32:16,257
Ms. Nowak.

393
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:50,257
Ms. Kuhn, I can't believe
what I'm seeing.

394
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:53,840
That's your proof? You
can't recognize anyone.

395
00:32:54,757 --> 00:32:55,923
But the blouse?

396
00:32:57,216 --> 00:32:58,309
Yes?

397
00:32:58,507 --> 00:33:02,548
If I'm not mistaken,
that's the blouse you're wearing right now.

398
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:08,132
And you've checked that none
of the 70 people who

399
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:11,257
come and go here are wearing
the same blouse?

400
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:15,049
50 percent of them are men,

401
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:17,841
they don't wear them,
and the rest are in class or sick.

402
00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:24,507
If there is no joint solution now,
I will unfortunately have to report it.

403
00:33:25,257 --> 00:33:28,382
- What kind of solution?
- A joint solution.

404
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,466
A start would be for Ms. Nowak
to get her money back.

405
00:33:33,841 --> 00:33:34,841
So...

406
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:38,924
So you have already
made your judgment.

407
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:41,674
Here you go.

408
00:33:44,716 --> 00:33:45,716
Well!

409
00:33:45,882 --> 00:33:47,923
There! Why don't you take it?

410
00:33:48,382 --> 00:33:49,520
Oh!

411
00:33:49,966 --> 00:33:52,216
Well, as luck would have it,

412
00:33:52,632 --> 00:33:56,465
I have to go to the bank
because I don't have any money.

413
00:33:56,632 --> 00:34:00,752
Or is there something else here
that belongs to you?

414
00:34:00,858 --> 00:34:02,382
Please, take it.

415
00:34:02,716 --> 00:34:04,924
Or do you want to frisk me?

416
00:34:05,382 --> 00:34:06,548
Here!

417
00:34:07,123 --> 00:34:09,923
That's part of the agenda here now.

418
00:34:21,007 --> 00:34:22,673
- Is everything okay?
- Hold on.

419
00:34:25,091 --> 00:34:27,632
- What's going on?
- Ms. Kuhn?

420
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,153
- Nothing.
- Tell me something!

421
00:34:29,341 --> 00:34:32,966
- Come.
- Ms. Kuhn, please let's talk.

422
00:34:33,132 --> 00:34:34,840
Mom, where are we going?

423
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:38,132
Ms. Kuhn, please stop for a moment.

424
00:34:38,466 --> 00:34:40,257
Tell me what's going on.

425
00:34:43,424 --> 00:34:44,424
Come.

426
00:34:44,591 --> 00:34:46,382
- Let go of me!
- Now!

427
00:34:47,757 --> 00:34:49,840
Come! Please come now.

428
00:35:02,507 --> 00:35:05,048
... I'll tell you later.

429
00:35:07,049 --> 00:35:08,432
Can we talk privately?

430
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:11,424
You can speak freely
in front of Mr. Dudek.

431
00:35:14,466 --> 00:35:17,341
- I think we've made a big mistake.
- Oh?

432
00:35:17,507 --> 00:35:20,215
Strictly speaking,
the video is not clear evidence.

433
00:35:20,382 --> 00:35:22,715
It's too late to take it back now.

434
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:27,132
There's another problem, Carla.
Your video violates personal rights.

435
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:30,090
Not just those of Ms. Kuhn,
but of all colleagues.

436
00:35:30,257 --> 00:35:31,298
Shit.

437
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:36,132
- We shouldn't have shown her the video.
- No crying over spilt milk.

438
00:35:36,466 --> 00:35:37,507
What now?

439
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:42,049
I call our lawyers, who will advise
us to give the video to the police,

440
00:35:42,216 --> 00:35:43,562
Police? Is that necessary?

441
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,165
... to file a complaint
against unknown persons.

442
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:50,382
Until then, let's agree on a language,
a wording, shall we?

443
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:54,757
And forbid ourselves accusations,
suspicions and prejudices.

444
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:56,757
Understood. I'll work on it.

445
00:35:57,841 --> 00:35:58,841
Got it?

446
00:36:01,632 --> 00:36:02,798
What about Oskar?

447
00:36:45,132 --> 00:36:46,632
Luise, not bad.

448
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:51,049
Well done.

449
00:36:51,216 --> 00:36:52,757
- Ruby.
- Thank you very much.

450
00:36:53,216 --> 00:36:56,799
- And Ela. You studied together?
- Yes.

451
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,882
Tom.

452
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:01,215
You still have to do better.

453
00:37:03,966 --> 00:37:06,674
- Ali, much better.
- Cool, a 3!

454
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:08,424
- Phileas.
- I got a 3!

455
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:11,757
What was going on there?
You usually manage a 3 too.

456
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:18,007
Congratulations to you.
Very good, Oskar.

457
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:19,882
Really good.

458
00:37:20,674 --> 00:37:21,924
- Vera, also good.
- Yes!

459
00:37:25,716 --> 00:37:26,799
Ruben.

460
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,465
Not bad.

461
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:33,132
So I'm happy.

462
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:35,382
What have you got?

463
00:37:35,882 --> 00:37:37,923
Guys! Hey!

464
00:37:41,049 --> 00:37:45,215
I've emailed your parents about
the deposit for the England exchange.

465
00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:46,702
Did you remember them?

466
00:37:46,966 --> 00:37:48,049
Yes.

467
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:50,674
Good. Josephine?

468
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:53,674
Could you write the grade sheet
on the blackboard?

469
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:55,299
- Yes!
- Please.

470
00:37:55,632 --> 00:37:57,090
No! For what?

471
00:37:59,216 --> 00:38:01,924
Who wants to see the grade
sheet on the blackboard?

472
00:38:05,174 --> 00:38:07,257
Which one of you...

473
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:10,549
Who does not want to see the grade
sheet on the blackboard?

474
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:13,624
Hey!

475
00:38:13,674 --> 00:38:16,049
Josefine, why is this
important to you?

476
00:38:16,841 --> 00:38:18,966
I would like to know where I stand.

477
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:21,257
You are sitting on a chair.

478
00:38:24,284 --> 00:38:25,299
Tom.

479
00:38:25,466 --> 00:38:29,341
- What if you have the worst grade?
- Too bad, you should have studied.

480
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,757
Yes, what if you get a bad grade?

481
00:38:32,216 --> 00:38:34,424
And everyone wants to see
it on the blackboard?

482
00:38:34,924 --> 00:38:35,924
Ruby?

483
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,715
Well, that won't matter for long.

484
00:38:38,924 --> 00:38:42,507
In 1 or 2 weeks, you'll forget
who has a 1 and who has a 6.

485
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:45,257
If it doesn't matter,
I won't write it on there.

486
00:38:46,148 --> 00:38:47,216
Hey!

487
00:38:48,549 --> 00:38:51,715
We'll carry on and I won't
write the grades on the board.

488
00:38:51,882 --> 00:38:53,965
If you...

489
00:38:56,299 --> 00:39:00,049
If you want to know where you stand,
come and see me after the lesson.

490
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,132
Please raise your chairs.
Thank you.

491
00:39:09,674 --> 00:39:12,090
Ms. Nowak, I need the class register.

492
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:15,840
Thank you.

493
00:39:16,007 --> 00:39:17,257
- Here you go.
- Bye.

494
00:39:21,007 --> 00:39:23,257
Are you waiting for something, Oskar?

495
00:39:25,757 --> 00:39:28,382
You should be proud
of your great work.

496
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:32,924
Here, take a look.

497
00:39:36,132 --> 00:39:37,673
I wanted to show this to you.

498
00:39:39,966 --> 00:39:41,257
Do you know what that is?

499
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,382
This is a Rubik's cube.

500
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,340
It has nothing to do with
magic, but with math.

501
00:39:49,174 --> 00:39:50,715
There are algorithms with which

502
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:56,590
you can solve the cube immediately.
Do you know what an algorithm is?

503
00:39:58,216 --> 00:40:02,674
It's a clear sequence of
actions to solve a problem.

504
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:03,966
Look.

505
00:40:18,132 --> 00:40:19,382
Do you want to try it?

506
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:31,424
If you want, I can lend it to you.

507
00:40:31,841 --> 00:40:33,257
What do I have to do?

508
00:40:33,591 --> 00:40:36,757
You have to turn until all
sides are one color.

509
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:43,465
It will only get harder.

510
00:40:43,799 --> 00:40:46,549
Keep it until you've solved it.

511
00:40:50,716 --> 00:40:53,549
And if something is bothering
you, you can talk to me.

512
00:40:56,779 --> 00:40:59,350
Or with Mrs. Semnik,
the guidance counselor.

513
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,090
Why did mom cry yesterday?

514
00:41:03,257 --> 00:41:05,048
Didn't you talk about it?

515
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:07,966
I see.

516
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:11,424
Did you have a fight with her?

517
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:19,423
Hello, Oskar. Come in.

518
00:41:19,716 --> 00:41:20,882
Sit down.

519
00:41:21,424 --> 00:41:23,090
Hello Oskar.

520
00:41:27,091 --> 00:41:31,466
We wanted to talk to
your mom, but she's not answering.

521
00:41:32,049 --> 00:41:33,382
Would you like a sweet?

522
00:41:37,091 --> 00:41:39,757
She slept this morning and
didn't want to talk.

523
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:45,591
Could you call her
on your cell phone?

524
00:41:45,841 --> 00:41:47,091
What should I say?

525
00:41:47,757 --> 00:41:49,548
That we want to talk to her.

526
00:41:56,132 --> 00:42:00,548
Hello, mom, I'm in Dr. Böhm's office.
She wants to talk to you.

527
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:07,007
Yes.

528
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,632
Okay. Yes, mom. Bye.

529
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:15,966
So? What did she say?

530
00:42:16,966 --> 00:42:20,549
That she... she doesn't want
to talk to you. And...

531
00:42:22,257 --> 00:42:23,340
And?

532
00:42:23,591 --> 00:42:25,841
That you should not interfere.

533
00:42:27,382 --> 00:42:29,257
What did mom do wrong?

534
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:32,257
Better to discuss this
with your mother.

535
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,340
No, why? Just say it.

536
00:42:35,091 --> 00:42:39,132
All right, you're already grown up
and you'll find out in the end anyway.

537
00:42:39,966 --> 00:42:42,424
Your mom will no longer
be working for the time being.

538
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:46,924
I say "for the time being" because
we first have to find out what happened.

539
00:42:47,424 --> 00:42:48,674
And what happened?

540
00:42:49,257 --> 00:42:51,965
Well, that still needs
to be found out.

541
00:42:52,257 --> 00:42:53,715
I want to know now.

542
00:42:53,882 --> 00:42:56,132
I can't tell you any
more at the moment.

543
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:00,090
Is it about the thefts?

544
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:04,757
What makes you think that?
That's not what we're talking about.

545
00:43:04,924 --> 00:43:08,674
You're keeping things from me and
saying mom doesn't work here anymore.

546
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,424
It wasn't her.

547
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:17,924
Nobody said that.

548
00:43:18,091 --> 00:43:19,924
Nobody is accusing your mom.

549
00:43:20,507 --> 00:43:22,757
But tell her we need to talk to her.

550
00:43:22,924 --> 00:43:25,424
Oskar, come on,
let's go outside.

551
00:43:46,674 --> 00:43:49,507
- That was so unnecessary.
- Yes, that was unnecessary.

552
00:43:51,674 --> 00:43:53,549
I thought we were keeping quiet?

553
00:43:53,716 --> 00:43:56,549
Language, regulation,
wording, those were your words.

554
00:43:57,507 --> 00:44:00,798
Firstly, I didn't say anything
he didn't already know.

555
00:44:00,966 --> 00:44:03,216
Secondly, you brought him here!

556
00:44:03,382 --> 00:44:05,590
But not to make vague allusions!

557
00:44:05,757 --> 00:44:10,257
- We wanted to avoid that.
- Trust my many years of experience.

558
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:13,590
Experience? Can't you
see how confused he is?

559
00:44:13,757 --> 00:44:16,882
The boy is crystal clear.
He can add 1 +1 together.

560
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:19,424
We are the ones who are confused.

561
00:45:11,591 --> 00:45:14,716
The children are
great. They are friendly.

562
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:16,590
They help each other.

563
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:20,340
Overall, it is a very
cooperative class.

564
00:45:21,299 --> 00:45:23,879
Of course, there's still
room for improvement...

565
00:45:23,903 --> 00:45:25,049
All right. Ciao.

566
00:45:25,841 --> 00:45:27,132
- Um...
- Hello.

567
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:29,965
Hello, uh, Nauhaus, I'm Tom's father.

568
00:45:30,382 --> 00:45:32,715
- Ah yes, why don't you take a seat?
- Yes.

569
00:45:33,257 --> 00:45:36,840
Um, I was just about to
describe my impressions.

570
00:45:37,007 --> 00:45:41,465
It is very important that the children
develop a sense of initiative. Um...

571
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:45,090
Here is information about
the school trip.

572
00:45:45,257 --> 00:45:46,882
- It's also been emailed.
- Thank you.

573
00:45:47,049 --> 00:45:50,007
Jieun said the math test was bad?

574
00:45:50,174 --> 00:45:51,326
Unfortunately, that's true.

575
00:45:51,655 --> 00:45:53,882
Then it's not just the
children who have failed, is it?

576
00:45:54,757 --> 00:45:58,215
I wouldn't say it that way.
"Failure" is too strong.

577
00:45:58,382 --> 00:46:01,465
I also hardly understand
the material.

578
00:46:02,848 --> 00:46:04,849
A black box for
me too, quite honestly.

579
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,495
These are not tasks
for twelve-year-olds.

580
00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:11,257
It's 7th grade material.
I stick to the curriculum.

581
00:46:12,424 --> 00:46:14,965
Ms. Nowak, I also have a
topic for discussion.

582
00:46:15,174 --> 00:46:16,382
Yes, please.

583
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:20,882
Jenny told me that there
was an interrogation.

584
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:25,465
And that she was coerced into revealing
information about classmates.

585
00:46:25,841 --> 00:46:28,549
I don't know if everyone is aware.

586
00:46:28,716 --> 00:46:31,382
It was also a topic in the
parents' WhatsApp group.

587
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:33,958
Perhaps you could
say something about that?

588
00:46:34,311 --> 00:46:35,457
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

589
00:46:35,882 --> 00:46:37,840
So, nobody was coerced.

590
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:42,507
We sought a conversation with the
class representatives, um...

591
00:46:43,632 --> 00:46:45,645
And asked them to help
in this matter.

592
00:46:45,898 --> 00:46:49,507
It seems to me as if the children
were being coerced,

593
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:53,132
and were being incited
to denounce others.

594
00:46:53,341 --> 00:46:56,132
Here, too, I find the choice
of words very drastic.

595
00:46:56,299 --> 00:46:57,805
We asked the children for help.

596
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:02,299
You made them snitch on classmates
and keep quiet about it.

597
00:47:02,466 --> 00:47:06,716
You must know that this creates
immense psychological pressure.

598
00:47:06,882 --> 00:47:11,382
Confidentiality should allow children to
speak freely about pressure,

599
00:47:11,924 --> 00:47:13,299
within a protected space.

600
00:47:13,716 --> 00:47:16,924
I would be happy to talk to
you after the meeting...

601
00:47:17,091 --> 00:47:19,382
But this is everyone's business.

602
00:47:19,549 --> 00:47:20,799
Come in.

603
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:22,841
Everyone should hear...

604
00:47:28,257 --> 00:47:29,257
Ms. Kuhn.

605
00:47:33,591 --> 00:47:34,841
Carry on.

606
00:47:35,424 --> 00:47:36,549
Uh, okay.

607
00:47:37,757 --> 00:47:38,757
Um...

608
00:47:39,799 --> 00:47:40,965
Where were we?

609
00:47:41,174 --> 00:47:44,049
What happened to Ali?
I didn't notice.

610
00:47:44,882 --> 00:47:48,673
There was one procedure that I
didn't think was okay either,

611
00:47:48,882 --> 00:47:51,215
but I can assure you,

612
00:47:51,632 --> 00:47:53,503
that we have the
problem under control.

613
00:47:53,527 --> 00:47:55,298
What does "under
control" mean?

614
00:47:55,632 --> 00:47:57,965
We can speak more in a
separate conversation.

615
00:47:58,757 --> 00:48:01,548
Why don't you tell the
rest of the story?

616
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:03,465
What rest of the story?

617
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,091
Hmm?

618
00:48:06,924 --> 00:48:09,007
The parents have a right
to know what happened.

619
00:48:10,704 --> 00:48:12,465
This is not the right time...

620
00:48:12,632 --> 00:48:16,298
The parents have a right
to know that their

621
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,757
children's teacher will
end up in court.

622
00:48:19,007 --> 00:48:21,382
Ms. Kuhn, that is inappropriate.

623
00:48:21,549 --> 00:48:22,633
That's it!

624
00:48:24,257 --> 00:48:27,022
Do you want to
know what happened?

625
00:48:27,685 --> 00:48:29,187
Yes, of course!

626
00:48:29,757 --> 00:48:33,632
This woman recorded videos.
Secretly. At school.

627
00:48:33,882 --> 00:48:37,757
- What? Of whom?
- Of her colleagues, imagine that.

628
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:40,757
Spying. Denunciation.

629
00:48:41,841 --> 00:48:44,924
Slander! Character assassination!
Everything that goes with it!

630
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:49,327
Entire livelihoods
are being destroyed here

631
00:48:49,574 --> 00:48:52,054
simply on the
basis of assumptions.

632
00:48:53,341 --> 00:48:56,091
If I were you,
I wouldn't believe a word she says!

633
00:49:02,757 --> 00:49:04,173
Shame on you.

634
00:49:06,382 --> 00:49:07,882
Yes, shame on you.

635
00:49:19,341 --> 00:49:21,549
Ms. Nowak, what is this?

636
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,756
Excuse me.

637
00:50:22,985 --> 00:50:25,725
It was thought to
be a sign of disaster,

638
00:50:25,749 --> 00:50:27,925
a punishment by divine powers.

639
00:50:28,299 --> 00:50:30,025
But then came Thales of Miletus.

640
00:50:30,841 --> 00:50:35,341
He was a mathematician and knew
that a solar eclipse occurs

641
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,715
when the moon moves between
the sun and the earth.

642
00:50:39,049 --> 00:50:40,049
There.

643
00:50:41,382 --> 00:50:43,715
There is a partial,

644
00:50:44,382 --> 00:50:48,007
an annular and a total solar eclipse.

645
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:51,174
With the help of mathematical
calculations,

646
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:55,341
Thales was able to accurately predict
the next solar eclipse.

647
00:50:56,549 --> 00:50:58,965
And the unpredictable
became predictable.

648
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:02,007
Thank you. End of presentation.

649
00:51:05,299 --> 00:51:07,340
Thank you, you can sit down.

650
00:51:08,257 --> 00:51:10,495
What has it done
to people,

651
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:12,757
that the unpredictable has
become predictable?

652
00:51:13,299 --> 00:51:14,465
Jieun?

653
00:51:14,632 --> 00:51:18,132
Um... did people no longer
believe in God?

654
00:51:18,299 --> 00:51:21,715
Thanks Lukas, you can pick
up the phone from me later.

655
00:51:22,757 --> 00:51:25,673
No longer believed in God.
There's something to that.

656
00:51:25,841 --> 00:51:28,007
Through a new critical spirit,

657
00:51:28,174 --> 00:51:31,924
Thales ushered in something
like modern astronomy.

658
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:35,715
- You know astronomy, right?
- You mean like zodiac signs?

659
00:51:36,132 --> 00:51:38,715
That's astrology.
That's something else.

660
00:51:39,216 --> 00:51:41,549
Who knows what astronomy means?

661
00:51:41,716 --> 00:51:43,841
- Something to do with star research?
- Exactly.

662
00:51:44,757 --> 00:51:48,423
Astronomy is the science
of celestial bodies.

663
00:51:49,091 --> 00:51:53,424
The phenomena of the world were no
longer explained by God or higher powers,

664
00:51:53,993 --> 00:51:57,493
but a universally verifiable
truth was sought.

665
00:51:57,674 --> 00:51:59,799
Modern science is based on this.

666
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:02,215
Yes, Lukas.

667
00:52:02,382 --> 00:52:06,382
Would you please put my cell phone in
your pocket so that no one steals it?

668
00:52:07,299 --> 00:52:10,090
Your phone is safe in this class.

669
00:52:10,341 --> 00:52:12,257
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

670
00:52:12,924 --> 00:52:16,632
- Okay, what do you mean by that?
- He means me. But it wasn't me.

671
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:19,882
That's right. That was clarified
in the parents' meeting.

672
00:52:20,049 --> 00:52:24,424
I don't mean Ali. We learned
in biology that traits are hereditary.

673
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:26,256
Shut up!

674
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:28,757
I don't understand that.
Please explain.

675
00:52:28,924 --> 00:52:30,840
For example, from mother to son.

676
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,036
If the mother is fat,
the child will also be fat.

677
00:52:35,382 --> 00:52:36,882
Shut up!

678
00:52:37,882 --> 00:52:38,923
Shut up!

679
00:52:39,091 --> 00:52:40,757
It's not quite that simple...

680
00:52:40,913 --> 00:52:41,953
Hey.

681
00:52:42,591 --> 00:52:44,011
It's not quite that simple,

682
00:52:44,064 --> 00:52:46,411
but you're obviously
alluding to something else.

683
00:52:47,049 --> 00:52:49,965
So can you please explain to me
who inherits what from whom?

684
00:52:50,132 --> 00:52:51,715
Doesn't matter now, does it?

685
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:55,173
- You have nothing to say about it?
- No, we are on...

686
00:52:55,341 --> 00:52:57,591
- Coward!
- ...another topic.

687
00:52:57,882 --> 00:52:59,632
Nothing more to say?

688
00:52:59,799 --> 00:53:03,382
That was a poor thesis, Lukas.
Think first, then talk.

689
00:53:03,549 --> 00:53:04,895
- I think so too.
- Such an idiot.

690
00:53:08,466 --> 00:53:09,966
<i>Hello?</i>

691
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:12,673
- Hello, is this Mrs. Wizorek speaking?
- <i>Yes.</i>

692
00:53:13,049 --> 00:53:17,340
This is Carla Nowak, Lukas' teacher.
Do you have time to talk?

693
00:53:17,507 --> 00:53:20,360
<i>I'm on my break, but
I'm glad you called.</i>

694
00:53:20,459 --> 00:53:22,715
<i>What happened at the
parents' meeting yesterday?</i>

695
00:53:24,007 --> 00:53:26,173
Too bad you couldn't make it.

696
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:29,507
<i>In the parent chat, they said that you
don't have the situation under control.</i>

697
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:32,007
<i>You don't want to know the rest.</i>

698
00:53:32,174 --> 00:53:34,590
Well, I was actually calling
about Lukas.

699
00:53:34,841 --> 00:53:39,174
<i>We parents will be talking to
the school administrators again.

700
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:43,299
I see. Then we should also
talk about Lukas' behavior.

701
00:53:43,466 --> 00:53:45,257
<i>What about his behavior?</i>

702
00:53:45,674 --> 00:53:46,840
Uh, one second.

703
00:53:47,174 --> 00:53:49,340
Oskar, you can't be here.

704
00:53:50,132 --> 00:53:51,632
<i>Ms. Nowak?</i>

705
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:56,757
Do you want to sit down here?

706
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:05,716
Why is everyone so sure?

707
00:54:06,341 --> 00:54:09,799
No one is sure. The whole
thing is currently being checked.

708
00:54:10,216 --> 00:54:12,507
And why isn't my mother working?

709
00:54:12,674 --> 00:54:14,382
Officially, she is on vacation.

710
00:54:14,716 --> 00:54:15,799
Is there any evidence?

711
00:54:15,966 --> 00:54:18,174
- For what?
- For your accusation.

712
00:54:18,341 --> 00:54:21,757
There is clear evidence,
but we can't tell you anything about that.

713
00:54:21,924 --> 00:54:24,799
- What kind of evidence?
- We're not allowed to tell you.

714
00:54:26,382 --> 00:54:28,173
Can I be alone with Mrs. Nowak?

715
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:31,174
Why?

716
00:54:34,841 --> 00:54:36,591
Okay. I'll wait outside.

717
00:54:56,757 --> 00:54:57,798
What is that?

718
00:54:58,257 --> 00:55:00,090
63 euros and 45 cents.

719
00:55:00,591 --> 00:55:03,132
My savings. You can have that.

720
00:55:04,257 --> 00:55:06,590
Did your mom tell you
to give it to me?

721
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:10,382
- Oskar, it's not about money.
- Then what is it about?

722
00:55:11,632 --> 00:55:13,382
It's about stealing.

723
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:17,549
It doesn't matter whether it's 1 cent or
100 euros. It's all about being honest.

724
00:55:17,882 --> 00:55:19,590
Put the money back in the bag.

725
00:55:27,882 --> 00:55:29,423
It wasn't my mom.

726
00:55:29,882 --> 00:55:31,548
Yes, okay. I understand.

727
00:55:31,716 --> 00:55:34,841
You should not only understand,
but say it.

728
00:55:35,007 --> 00:55:37,632
- Say what?
- Say it.

729
00:55:38,132 --> 00:55:40,798
- Yes, what?
- That she's innocent.

730
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:46,340
Your mom is innocent,
Oskar. Satisfied?

731
00:55:46,966 --> 00:55:50,757
Apologize publicly and
straighten it out.

732
00:55:50,924 --> 00:55:53,882
- Sorry, I can't do that.
- You should, because otherwise...

733
00:55:54,049 --> 00:55:56,549
- Otherwise what?
- Otherwise you'll regret it.

734
00:55:56,716 --> 00:55:58,882
- Are you threatening me right now?
- Maybe.

735
00:55:59,424 --> 00:56:01,424
I don't want to hear that...

736
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,671
Then apologize
publicly, otherwise

737
00:56:03,695 --> 00:56:06,091
you will see what
will come out of it!

738
00:56:30,716 --> 00:56:32,341
Hey! Carla, well?

739
00:56:32,841 --> 00:56:35,049
- A piece of cake?
- Something to celebrate?

740
00:56:35,216 --> 00:56:38,216
- It's my birthday.
- Happy birthday. Are you celebrating?

741
00:56:38,382 --> 00:56:42,882
Nope, I have to make copies
later, prepare the rooms for

742
00:56:44,049 --> 00:56:46,090
the parents' meeting, and I have to...
- Can I help?

743
00:56:46,257 --> 00:56:47,882
Oh no, that's fine.

744
00:56:48,466 --> 00:56:51,632
Say, the other day, that must
have been quite a show.

745
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:53,632
- What do you mean?
- The parents' meeting.

746
00:56:53,799 --> 00:56:56,799
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Good. These things happen.

747
00:56:56,966 --> 00:56:59,299
- ...<i>that you were born...</i>
- Yummy, eh?

748
00:56:59,466 --> 00:57:00,838
- What things happen?
- Ms. Kuhn.

749
00:57:00,924 --> 00:57:02,643
Speaking of which, I will

750
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:05,424
be taking legal action
against Ms. Kuhn.

751
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:08,465
And supposedly there's a video?

752
00:57:09,299 --> 00:57:13,174
Just because she stole from me doesn't
mean she stole from you.

753
00:57:13,341 --> 00:57:16,091
- It could have been someone else.
- That's right.

754
00:57:16,257 --> 00:57:18,132
Did you make a video?

755
00:57:21,276 --> 00:57:24,192
And... can we see that?

756
00:57:24,424 --> 00:57:28,090
- Not at the moment, no.
- Stupid question, but why not?

757
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:30,090
It's evidence for the police.

758
00:57:30,257 --> 00:57:32,423
- I can't show it around.
- Show it around?

759
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:36,424
I am also one of the victims,
I was also robbed, several times.

760
00:57:36,716 --> 00:57:41,216
- And you refuse to help me?
- The one has nothing to do with the other.

761
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:44,882
You know, Carla, to be honest,
I feel uncomfortable that

762
00:57:45,049 --> 00:57:48,799
secret video recordings
were made here. So...

763
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:52,966
- Who else is on the video?
- I guarantee you, you are not.

764
00:57:53,299 --> 00:57:56,007
- I still don't think it's good.
- Okay, noted.

765
00:57:56,174 --> 00:57:58,924
- Is there any cake left?
- Help yourself!

766
00:57:59,924 --> 00:58:04,424
I understand that this is a bit much
for you. Perhaps you are overwhelmed.

767
00:58:04,674 --> 00:58:06,257
Not at all. It's all good.

768
00:58:06,424 --> 00:58:10,924
But perhaps we can still take
joint action against Ms. Kuhn.

769
00:58:11,341 --> 00:58:13,653
The poor woman is
already losing her job.

770
00:58:13,677 --> 00:58:15,466
"The poor woman"? Seriously?

771
00:58:15,632 --> 00:58:16,965
Doesn't look like fun.

772
00:58:17,139 --> 00:58:21,305
We honor your compassion, but
you also have a responsibility to us.

773
00:58:21,466 --> 00:58:25,799
That's exactly why I can't help
you any further, I'm sorry.

774
00:58:25,966 --> 00:58:29,007
- Unbelievable.
- May I remind you, Mr. Liebenwerda,

775
00:58:29,174 --> 00:58:33,257
that you wanted to smuggle
a private detective into the school?

776
00:58:33,424 --> 00:58:36,757
- That was a joke!
- And there is a difference, Carla.

777
00:58:36,924 --> 00:58:39,162
With the detective,
everyone would have known.

778
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:41,766
What you did
was behind our backs.

779
00:58:41,932 --> 00:58:45,757
Excuse me, there are some
students outside for you.

780
00:58:50,966 --> 00:58:52,299
Hello Mrs. Nowak!

781
00:58:52,507 --> 00:58:55,215
Hello folks. What can I do for you?

782
00:58:55,507 --> 00:58:58,298
You wanted to give an interview
to the school magazine.

783
00:58:58,466 --> 00:59:00,591
We were supposed to meet
on Tuesday, weren't we?

784
00:59:00,757 --> 00:59:04,382
We have to go to print earlier because
our room will be occupied.

785
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:06,132
Exactly.

786
00:59:08,007 --> 00:59:10,298
It also only takes 15 minutes.

787
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:13,590
Do you want cake?

788
00:59:15,532 --> 00:59:16,673
Let's go.

789
00:59:27,132 --> 00:59:31,338
That's Paul, Daniel, Bine,
Krissi, Mitra, Flo.

790
00:59:31,499 --> 00:59:32,873
The rest aren't important.

791
00:59:33,091 --> 00:59:35,674
- Thank you for joining us.
- Sure.

792
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:37,341
Sit down.

793
00:59:38,674 --> 00:59:40,674
Okay. What do you want to know?

794
00:59:40,841 --> 00:59:44,632
Can we record the conversation?
It will be easier for us later.

795
00:59:46,132 --> 00:59:48,048
Okay.

796
00:59:48,216 --> 00:59:51,299
 You've been at our school since
the beginning of the semester.

797
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:52,841
How do you like it?

798
00:59:53,466 --> 00:59:57,882
I feel comfortable and the students
are all really nice.

799
00:59:58,299 --> 01:00:02,632
The faculty is also great.
There are differences of opinion, but...

800
01:00:03,549 --> 01:00:06,132
I was warmly welcomed into
the school family.

801
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:08,174
What kind of differences of opinion?

802
01:00:08,341 --> 01:00:11,382
What happens in the staff room
stays in the staff room.

803
01:00:12,132 --> 01:00:13,590
Next question:

804
01:00:13,882 --> 01:00:16,173
Nowak, isn't that a Polish name?

805
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:21,205
That's true. But I was born
in Westphalia and my parents

806
01:00:21,778 --> 01:00:24,757
came to Germany from near
Gdansk at the end of the 1960s.

807
01:00:25,716 --> 01:00:27,091
Do you speak Polish?

808
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:29,757
"Curiosity killed the cat."

809
01:00:30,507 --> 01:00:34,007
- What does that mean?
- That's part of your research.

810
01:00:34,174 --> 01:00:35,549
Okay, um...

811
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:38,090
Do you have tattoos?
And if so, where?

812
01:00:41,007 --> 01:00:44,382
I always wanted some, but
was too cowardly. Fortunately.

813
01:00:44,549 --> 01:00:46,757
Do you have a tip for
your younger self?

814
01:00:46,924 --> 01:00:49,174
How do I say this without
sounding precocious?

815
01:00:50,466 --> 01:00:54,966
The insecurities you have as a young
person are completely normal.

816
01:00:55,132 --> 01:00:58,923
I wish someone had told me back then
that everything would be fine.

817
01:00:59,091 --> 01:01:02,882
Or that everything is fine and that
I can listen to my gut feeling.

818
01:01:03,049 --> 01:01:04,674
I have to interject here.

819
01:01:04,841 --> 01:01:08,257
You said at the beginning that you
feel comfortable at the school.

820
01:01:08,424 --> 01:01:11,049
I just can't comprehend that.

821
01:01:11,216 --> 01:01:14,216
I find the atmosphere at
our school unpleasant.

822
01:01:14,549 --> 01:01:18,715
- Okay. What do you think?
- It's no secret that people steal.

823
01:01:19,716 --> 01:01:23,216
Do you know how it came about
that students were suspected?

824
01:01:23,382 --> 01:01:25,257
Those were false accusations.

825
01:01:25,424 --> 01:01:28,799
You're right about that.
But something had to be done,

826
01:01:28,966 --> 01:01:32,341
also to protect those who
had nothing to do with it.

827
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,882
I'm sorry that the wrong
people were suspected.

828
01:01:36,049 --> 01:01:40,549
That doesn't answer the question.
How did we come to be suspected?

829
01:01:41,341 --> 01:01:45,007
There were clues,
but they weren't helpful.

830
01:01:45,841 --> 01:01:47,216
That didn't go well.

831
01:01:47,382 --> 01:01:50,882
And Ms. Kuhn is no longer allowed
to work here after 14 years?

832
01:01:51,299 --> 01:01:53,132
- Wasn't it 15?
- Nope.

833
01:01:53,632 --> 01:01:56,132
This is a matter for the school
supervisory authority.

834
01:01:56,872 --> 01:01:59,708
Was Ms. Kuhn suspended for stealing?

835
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:02,174
I can't comment on that.

836
01:02:02,341 --> 01:02:06,257
- Was there secret video surveillance?
- I can't say anything about that either.

837
01:02:06,424 --> 01:02:09,424
- You can't say or don't know?
- Are you not allowed to say?

838
01:02:09,757 --> 01:02:13,173
I probably could, but I don't
think it would be right.

839
01:02:13,341 --> 01:02:16,716
- Is it not our students' business?
- Yes, of course it is.

840
01:02:17,216 --> 01:02:19,007
- Yes.
- And?

841
01:02:20,132 --> 01:02:24,257
- If there are no more questions...
- Should Oskar Kuhn change schools?

842
01:02:24,591 --> 01:02:26,341
- Where did you get that from?
- Well.

843
01:02:26,507 --> 01:02:28,840
- Who says so?
- Just the grapevine.

844
01:02:29,007 --> 01:02:32,277
You understand that we
must protect our sources.

845
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:33,586
Your sources?

846
01:02:34,257 --> 01:02:37,840
Stop spreading rumors.
That's totally dubious.

847
01:02:38,007 --> 01:02:40,215
We want to know what's
going on at the school.

848
01:02:42,591 --> 01:02:44,857
We're done. Or do
you still have questions?

849
01:02:44,884 --> 01:02:45,891
Nope.

850
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:47,116
Thank you, Ms. Nowak.

851
01:02:47,174 --> 01:02:48,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

852
01:02:51,632 --> 01:02:53,423
Will you send me the
interview in advance?

853
01:02:53,591 --> 01:02:54,592
- Sure.
- When?

854
01:02:54,674 --> 01:02:55,965
When it's ready.

855
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:00,465
- Good.
- I need a photo of you. May I?

856
01:03:03,299 --> 01:03:04,340
Thank you.

857
01:03:08,007 --> 01:03:09,022
Thank you.

858
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:20,591
Hey Carla.

859
01:03:50,924 --> 01:03:52,215
Hey Carla.

860
01:04:06,924 --> 01:04:08,757
<i>Impudence!</i>

861
01:04:13,924 --> 01:04:15,007
<i>Get out!</i>

862
01:04:28,549 --> 01:04:29,924
Good day...

863
01:04:35,882 --> 01:04:37,382
At least it's quiet.

864
01:04:37,882 --> 01:04:40,632
Let's go through the homework.
Who will start?

865
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:44,924
- Ali, you wanted to say something?
- No, not at all.

866
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:50,173
If no one volunteers,
I'll have to ask you individually.

867
01:04:50,716 --> 01:04:53,257
Jieun, have you done your homework?

868
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:55,924
Jieun!

869
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,757
Okay. Hatice? Maybe you?

870
01:05:09,924 --> 01:05:13,299
Good. Then I'll sit down
too and we'll keep quiet.

871
01:05:16,424 --> 01:05:18,049
Stupid cow.

872
01:05:30,174 --> 01:05:33,382
- Tell me what's going on!
- Is Oskar being taken out of school?

873
01:05:33,548 --> 01:05:36,082
I have no idea where
this rumor came from,

874
01:05:36,195 --> 01:05:38,249
but if anyone knows,
it's Oskar himself.

875
01:05:39,007 --> 01:05:40,882
Do you want to say something, Oskar?

876
01:05:42,841 --> 01:05:45,757
Apparently not.
Let's get on with our homework.

877
01:05:45,924 --> 01:05:49,090
First tell us what has happened
and what will happen.

878
01:05:49,257 --> 01:05:51,763
If you want to talk about this,
bring it up in school council.

879
01:05:51,883 --> 01:05:53,770
Right now we're doing our lessons.

880
01:05:54,049 --> 01:05:57,382
- We have a right to know.
- Exactly.

881
01:05:57,549 --> 01:06:00,382
- Nobody apologized to me.
- That's not true.

882
01:06:00,549 --> 01:06:03,965
I apologized and so did Dr. Böhm.
In the office, remember?

883
01:06:04,132 --> 01:06:07,173
- What about the video?
- There is no video, for God's sake.

884
01:06:09,282 --> 01:06:10,383
Quiet now.

885
01:06:10,408 --> 01:06:12,215
Give me the homework books.

886
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:15,216
- Give me that.
- You won't get mine.

887
01:06:15,382 --> 01:06:17,548
- Lukas.
- Why do you start at the back?

888
01:06:17,716 --> 01:06:18,841
- Give it to me.
- Why?

889
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,215
Lukas, give me that.

890
01:06:21,091 --> 01:06:23,549
- Where's the homework?
- All because of him!

891
01:06:23,716 --> 01:06:26,382
- Just do your homework.
- Quiet, I said!

892
01:06:39,716 --> 01:06:41,966
So, who will come up to the board?

893
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:44,048
- No one.
- Yes, just that. No one.

894
01:06:44,216 --> 01:06:45,549
Tom, very good.

895
01:06:54,632 --> 01:06:55,882
Traitor.

896
01:06:56,049 --> 01:06:57,299
Who was that?

897
01:06:58,716 --> 01:07:00,674
- Who shouted "traitor"?
- Me.

898
01:07:01,382 --> 01:07:02,840
That's not okay, Jieun.

899
01:07:03,091 --> 01:07:05,757
- We should show solidarity.
- Exactly!

900
01:07:05,924 --> 01:07:09,340
You can afford to do that with your
grades. Otherwise I'd stay seated.

901
01:07:09,507 --> 01:07:10,798
- Traitor.
- Jieun?

902
01:07:10,966 --> 01:07:13,841
If you say that again,
I'll have to send you out.

903
01:07:14,007 --> 01:07:16,007
The whole thing is because of him.

904
01:07:16,507 --> 01:07:18,548
Leave Oskar alone and carry on.

905
01:07:18,716 --> 01:07:21,049
- Because of his criminal mother.
- What?

906
01:07:21,216 --> 01:07:23,091
- Because of his criminal mother.
- Out.

907
01:07:23,257 --> 01:07:25,423
- I'm the only one taking part!
- Out!

908
01:07:35,841 --> 01:07:37,466
By the way,

909
01:07:38,132 --> 01:07:41,673
Ms. Nowak, we're only doing the stupid
welcoming ceremony for you.

910
01:07:41,841 --> 01:07:43,007
Exactly.

911
01:07:43,174 --> 01:07:46,674
Totally bananas, you can
do that in 1st grade.

912
01:07:55,757 --> 01:07:58,173
Do you know how embarrassing this is?

913
01:08:23,757 --> 01:08:25,882
I've already mentioned it.

914
01:08:26,966 --> 01:08:30,007
The last few days and
weeks were not okay.

915
01:08:30,299 --> 01:08:31,924
Something has to change.

916
01:08:32,966 --> 01:08:35,716
Can anyone imagine what I mean?

917
01:08:36,174 --> 01:08:38,465
- Jonas?
- Are we still doing sports today?

918
01:08:39,466 --> 01:08:43,007
We'll have sports once we have
discussed a few things.

919
01:08:44,841 --> 01:08:47,507
We can discuss this in
the class council!

920
01:08:47,674 --> 01:08:50,549
We have to treat
each other differently.

921
01:08:52,007 --> 01:08:54,757
That's why I want to do
a few exercises today.

922
01:08:54,924 --> 01:08:58,382
I need six volunteers for
the first exercise.

923
01:08:58,757 --> 01:08:59,923
Who's up for it?

924
01:09:00,299 --> 01:09:02,549
One, two, three, four, five, six.

925
01:09:02,757 --> 01:09:03,882
Super.

926
01:09:04,049 --> 01:09:05,174
Please stand up.

927
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:08,299
For the first task, um...

928
01:09:09,216 --> 01:09:11,007
you stand on this crate.

929
01:09:11,882 --> 01:09:13,798
But no one is allowed to fall off.

930
01:09:14,424 --> 01:09:15,674
Give it a try.

931
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:31,340
Okay, those standing outside:

932
01:09:31,507 --> 01:09:34,923
Do you have any suggestions on what
could be done better? Thai?

933
01:09:35,674 --> 01:09:38,299
Maybe hold on to your shoulders?

934
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,091
Try it out.

935
01:09:52,299 --> 01:09:54,590
Is there another solution?

936
01:09:56,049 --> 01:09:58,215
Oskar, surely you have an idea?

937
01:09:58,882 --> 01:09:59,965
Say something.

938
01:10:01,132 --> 01:10:02,132
Hmm?

939
01:10:02,841 --> 01:10:04,966
We have to hold hands.

940
01:10:05,632 --> 01:10:06,632
Okay.

941
01:10:07,132 --> 01:10:09,431
Would you show us
how you imagine it?

942
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,048
Can you swap with Lukas?

943
01:10:11,966 --> 01:10:14,216
- Thanks, Lukas.
- Have fun, nerd.

944
01:10:14,382 --> 01:10:15,382
Hey!

945
01:10:23,341 --> 01:10:25,257
That looks good.

946
01:10:26,174 --> 01:10:27,549
Will the four of you join us?

947
01:10:29,007 --> 01:10:30,173
Crosswise, exactly.

948
01:10:31,799 --> 01:10:32,840
Yes!

949
01:10:34,674 --> 01:10:36,424
You have found the solution.

950
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:38,257
Oskar! Hey!

951
01:10:42,757 --> 01:10:44,257
Break it up, go!

952
01:10:45,049 --> 01:10:46,215
Tom! Tom!

953
01:10:48,549 --> 01:10:50,215
Now calm down!

954
01:10:51,174 --> 01:10:53,590
- Encore!
- Come on, wanker!

955
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:55,382
Oskar, listen to me!

956
01:10:56,049 --> 01:10:57,215
Out, Oskar!

957
01:10:57,841 --> 01:10:59,299
- Come on!
- Out!

958
01:11:00,007 --> 01:11:02,090
Come in when you've calmed down.

959
01:11:10,674 --> 01:11:14,132
That was an example of what I meant.

960
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:15,591
Ms. Nowak?

961
01:11:31,841 --> 01:11:32,841
Are you crazy?

962
01:11:33,382 --> 01:11:34,382
Ah!

963
01:11:40,882 --> 01:11:42,048
Oskar!

964
01:11:49,341 --> 01:11:50,382
Oskar!

965
01:11:51,049 --> 01:11:52,382
Oskar, stand still!

966
01:11:54,549 --> 01:11:55,590
Oskar!

967
01:12:01,799 --> 01:12:03,924
Oskar! Stand still!

968
01:12:06,174 --> 01:12:07,549
Give me the laptop.

969
01:12:31,325 --> 01:12:33,439
<i>The events surrounding
Oskar's mother create</i>

970
01:12:33,492 --> 01:12:35,299
<i>enormous psychological pressure.</i>

971
01:12:35,841 --> 01:12:40,341
<i>And although he receives support from some
of the class, he is bullied by others.</i>

972
01:12:41,716 --> 01:12:46,216
This leads to unrest and sometimes
even refusal to work in class.

973
01:12:46,841 --> 01:12:50,246
In addition, the student's frustration
manifests itself in an increased

974
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:53,382
willingness to use violence,
which manifests itself physically.

975
01:12:54,216 --> 01:12:57,257
I recommend that you consider
changing classes first.

976
01:12:57,424 --> 01:13:00,799
If the situation does not
improve for the student,

977
01:13:00,966 --> 01:13:04,299
a change of school could
also be considered.

978
01:13:04,466 --> 01:13:08,216
A new start, but one that
the mother would have to agree to.

979
01:13:09,382 --> 01:13:13,298
Thank you. Ms. Nowak, as Oskar's
teacher, it's your turn now.

980
01:13:13,466 --> 01:13:16,239
I consider it a
declaration of failure

981
01:13:16,548 --> 01:13:18,786
to send the student
to another school.

982
01:13:19,132 --> 01:13:22,798
But even in a different class
he is still someone who has

983
01:13:22,966 --> 01:13:27,466
incited the class to boycott,
beaten up his classmates

984
01:13:27,757 --> 01:13:30,673
smashed windows and stole a laptop.

985
01:13:30,841 --> 01:13:32,757
- He didn't want to steal it.
- What?

986
01:13:32,924 --> 01:13:35,924
- He wanted to protect his mother.
- If you say so.

987
01:13:36,091 --> 01:13:38,007
That does not undo the rest.

988
01:13:38,174 --> 01:13:40,387
You know we have a...

989
01:13:40,514 --> 01:13:43,419
Zero-tolerance policy.
Yes, I know, Dr. Böhm.

990
01:13:43,443 --> 01:13:45,924
 But this is something personal
between Oskar and me.

991
01:13:46,466 --> 01:13:48,704
Apparently he sees
me as responsible

992
01:13:48,728 --> 01:13:50,966
for the fact that his mother
no longer works here.

993
01:13:51,299 --> 01:13:56,543
I think it's a mistake to take a student
out of his or her social context.

994
01:13:57,091 --> 01:13:58,663
Punishing him for
a possible offense

995
01:13:58,687 --> 01:14:00,757
committed by his mother
is completely unfair.

996
01:14:00,924 --> 01:14:05,174
I would like to make it clear: 
This is solely about Oskar's behavior.

997
01:14:05,341 --> 01:14:06,547
Not about his mother.

998
01:14:06,681 --> 01:14:08,874
But we're only discussing
one perspective.

999
01:14:09,209 --> 01:14:11,746
What do we do with the student
to solve the problem?

1000
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:16,341
The consequences are then borne by others.
That must not happen.

1001
01:14:16,507 --> 01:14:17,840
I agree.

1002
01:14:18,007 --> 01:14:19,107
Please?

1003
01:14:19,132 --> 01:14:22,423
I also think that the consequences
would be borne by others.

1004
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,216
Mostly us students.

1005
01:14:26,841 --> 01:14:28,507
And what do you suggest?

1006
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:34,111
Since I'm partly to blame for this,
it shouldn't be Oskar who goes...

1007
01:14:34,324 --> 01:14:36,174
- Then what?
- It should be me.

1008
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:38,966
- Oh well.
- The school is already understaffed.

1009
01:14:39,132 --> 01:14:41,507
There are almost no
substitutes left.

1010
01:14:41,674 --> 01:14:45,507
- We can close the class down.
- That's out of the question.

1011
01:14:46,299 --> 01:14:50,174
So, we have now listened to Ms.
Semnik's expert opinion,

1012
01:14:50,341 --> 01:14:51,882

we have Ms. Nowak...

1013
01:14:52,049 --> 01:14:55,924
But we're deciding over Oskar.
We're pushing the problem away.

1014
01:14:56,341 --> 01:14:58,610
Firstly, we are not
pushing the problem away,

1015
01:14:58,634 --> 01:15:00,799
we are democratically
seeking a solution.

1016
01:15:01,674 --> 01:15:06,090
Secondly, Oskar and his mother don't
recognize their wrongdoings.

1017
01:15:06,257 --> 01:15:08,965
They had the opportunity
to comment here.

1018
01:15:09,132 --> 01:15:11,632
But they have refused
all communication.

1019
01:15:12,507 --> 01:15:15,173
If there are no more
questions, we vote.

1020
01:15:15,341 --> 01:15:17,716
- I have one more question.
- Please.

1021
01:15:17,882 --> 01:15:21,340
- Ms. Nowak, what's wrong with your eye?
- I fell down, as I said.

1022
01:15:21,507 --> 01:15:23,215
- What?
- Fell down.

1023
01:15:23,382 --> 01:15:24,781
That's not difficult
to understand.

1024
01:15:25,234 --> 01:15:27,548
Your commitment
to Oskar is admirable.

1025
01:15:27,716 --> 01:15:30,924
Thomas, what's that got
to do with it? Can we...

1026
01:15:31,091 --> 01:15:34,591
I just want to make sure that the
boy doesn't hit any teachers.

1027
01:15:34,757 --> 01:15:37,673
Oskar doesn't hit anyone.

1028
01:15:37,841 --> 01:15:39,299
I suggest
we take the vote now.

1029
01:15:39,882 --> 01:15:42,132
- Yes?
- Yes.

1030
01:15:42,299 --> 01:15:45,507
Does anyone have anything
against us voting openly?

1031
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:47,590
I would like to keep this anonymous.

1032
01:15:47,757 --> 01:15:52,257
All right, Ms. König would
like it to be anonymous.

1033
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:55,038
Then we will now vote
on whether Oskar Kuhn

1034
01:15:55,062 --> 01:15:57,382
should receive a 10-day
suspension from lessons,

1035
01:15:57,549 --> 01:16:01,007
and whether he is allowed to take part
in the school trip to England.

1036
01:16:01,341 --> 01:16:04,257
If the situation does not
improve after that,

1037
01:16:04,424 --> 01:16:06,924
we will have to meet again

1038
01:16:07,257 --> 01:16:10,840
and discuss stricter measures,
such as a change of school.

1039
01:16:16,091 --> 01:16:17,966
Give me the slips of paper.

1040
01:16:18,299 --> 01:16:20,924
- Have a nice evening.
- Take care.

1041
01:16:44,049 --> 01:16:46,715
Somehow it's still crooked.
On the left perhaps...

1042
01:16:48,591 --> 01:16:49,882
Look. Nowak.

1043
01:16:52,091 --> 01:16:53,257
Are you ready to go?

1044
01:16:53,424 --> 01:16:56,007
Not until Monday.
But we're already making preparations.

1045
01:16:56,382 --> 01:16:59,382
- Do you want a copy? Two euros.
- Two euros?

1046
01:16:59,549 --> 01:17:01,522
A bit expensive for a school
newspaper, isn't it?

1047
01:17:01,692 --> 01:17:04,885
We have expenses:
printing, research,

1048
01:17:05,398 --> 01:17:07,112
technology, milk and
coffee all cost money.

1049
01:17:08,007 --> 01:17:10,257
Didn't you want to send me the text?

1050
01:17:10,424 --> 01:17:12,340
- That was Krissi's job.
- I got nothing.

1051
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:16,216
Well, then you'll get an
advance copy. For free.

1052
01:17:28,216 --> 01:17:32,382
- Are you serious?
- We only wrote what you said.

1053
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:35,132
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1054
01:17:37,841 --> 01:17:40,757
- You have to take the piece out.
- Why?

1055
01:17:40,924 --> 01:17:43,882
Because you twist statements
and take them out of context.

1056
01:17:44,049 --> 01:17:46,590
Because this is something
between Ms. Kuhn and me...

1057
01:17:46,757 --> 01:17:49,132
We see it differently.
- This is journalism.

1058
01:17:49,299 --> 01:17:51,840
It is not. A review of
the text was promised.

1059
01:17:52,007 --> 01:17:54,882
We do not allow ourselves to be censored
to make you look better.

1060
01:17:55,049 --> 01:17:57,799
- It's not about looking better.
- Isn't it?

1061
01:17:57,966 --> 01:18:00,299
And not about censorship,
but about facts.

1062
01:18:00,466 --> 01:18:03,341
Which you denied us.
We shed light on the flip side.

1063
01:18:04,549 --> 01:18:07,590
- You talked to Ms. Kuhn?
- Well, what do you think?

1064
01:18:11,007 --> 01:18:12,090
Okay guys...

1065
01:18:13,049 --> 01:18:14,965
You're overshooting the mark.

1066
01:18:15,591 --> 01:18:17,132
This text is dubious!

1067
01:18:17,299 --> 01:18:20,049
- You're causing damage.
- We're bringing the truth.

1068
01:18:20,216 --> 01:18:23,299
- It's your problem if you can't stand it.
- You see.

1069
01:18:24,799 --> 01:18:27,090
TRUTH OVERCOMES
ALL BORDERS

1070
01:18:28,966 --> 01:18:30,507
Everything else is PR.

1071
01:18:52,257 --> 01:18:53,715
Do you want to talk?

1072
01:18:57,341 --> 01:18:58,757
Will you give me a hug?

1073
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:41,132
Hello, Mrs. Nowak!

1074
01:19:43,257 --> 01:19:45,632
Where can
you get a better deal?

1075
01:19:45,924 --> 01:19:48,090
Get the best information!

1076
01:19:50,049 --> 01:19:51,424
One euro for you!

1077
01:19:52,049 --> 01:19:53,090
Grab it!

1078
01:19:54,716 --> 01:19:56,341
Teachers pay more...

1079
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:00,380
- Why does she never come to us
when something is wrong?

1080
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,760
Team spirit...

1081
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,757
- Morning, Ms. Nowak.
- Morning.

1082
01:20:08,924 --> 01:20:11,799
- I wonder how you're doing today.
- Oh yeah?

1083
01:20:11,966 --> 01:20:13,257
Morning, Carla.
- Morning.

1084
01:20:13,424 --> 01:20:19,064
"Ideally, school is a protected space for
children and young people. Not for us."

1085
01:20:19,257 --> 01:20:22,882
"In the investigation of thefts, stuednts
were expected to do things

1086
01:20:23,049 --> 01:20:25,215
that they had only known
from unjust states."

1087
01:20:25,424 --> 01:20:31,457
"Ali Yilmaz was pulled out of class in
a raid and wrongly suspected."

1088
01:20:32,507 --> 01:20:35,241
"The teachers involved were
Milosz Dudek and Thomas Liebenwerda."

1089
01:20:35,374 --> 01:20:36,980
In other words, yours truly.

1090
01:20:37,382 --> 01:20:40,090
I know the text, you don't
have to read it out loud.

1091
01:20:40,257 --> 01:20:41,798
I want to hear it.

1092
01:20:41,966 --> 01:20:46,174
"To suspect a child with an immigrant
background in this way without evidence

1093
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:50,841
"shows that structural racism does
not stop at our school either."

1094
01:20:51,049 --> 01:20:54,545
"That was just the beginning:
without any concrete evidence,

1095
01:20:54,671 --> 01:20:57,923
"the good soul of the school,
Friederike Kuhn, was also suspended."

1096
01:20:58,091 --> 01:21:02,464
"The method is not for the faint-hearted:
a hidden camera!" There we are!

1097
01:21:02,751 --> 01:21:04,742
"Since Ms. Nowak
could not invalidate our

1098
01:21:04,766 --> 01:21:06,757
suspicions about
secret video surveillance,"

1099
01:21:07,341 --> 01:21:09,966
Could not invalidate!

1100
01:21:10,132 --> 01:21:14,257
"we spoke to the person concerned.
Ms. Kuhn confirmed that..." And so on.

1101
01:21:14,424 --> 01:21:18,924
How can it be that you refuse to
cooperate with us on the staff

1102
01:21:19,216 --> 01:21:23,257
but talk about the video with
children who need to be told off?

1103
01:21:23,424 --> 01:21:25,662
I still think talking
about things is

1104
01:21:25,686 --> 01:21:27,924
better than keeping
quiet about things.

1105
01:21:28,424 --> 01:21:30,465
And if you had read carefully,

1106
01:21:30,632 --> 01:21:33,507
you would know that I didn't
say anything about the video.

1107
01:21:33,674 --> 01:21:37,924
But they couldn't refute it either.
I can read. Simply unbelievable.

1108
01:21:38,091 --> 01:21:39,966
- You really are something.
- That's enough.

1109
01:21:40,132 --> 01:21:44,423
The desire to be well-received
by the students...

1110
01:21:44,591 --> 01:21:47,549
...is getting us totally into the shit.

1111
01:21:47,716 --> 01:21:49,549
No idea. Ah!

1112
01:21:51,091 --> 01:21:53,132
Vanessa had 25 emails.

1113
01:21:53,382 --> 01:21:57,882
May I have your attention for a moment?
Come over here, everyone.

1114
01:21:58,424 --> 01:22:00,882
Quiet, please.
You too, Mr. Liebenwerda.

1115
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:03,954
You have probably
noticed that there is an

1116
01:22:03,978 --> 01:22:06,715
unfortunate article in
the school newspaper.

1117
01:22:07,591 --> 01:22:11,007
I spoke to Mr. Dudek and
the legal department.

1118
01:22:11,174 --> 01:22:15,674
We are forced to prohibit the sale
of this edition on school premises.

1119
01:22:16,299 --> 01:22:18,799
Ms. Böhm and I took care
of the stand in the foyer.

1120
01:22:18,966 --> 01:22:21,924
Please prevent further
distribution in the classes.

1121
01:22:22,091 --> 01:22:26,299
- And the online edition?
- It has already been removed.

1122
01:22:26,466 --> 01:22:29,882
Peace at the school is
currently massively disturbed.

1123
01:22:30,049 --> 01:22:34,549
I therefore forbid you to talk about this
subject any further with immediate effect.

1124
01:22:34,799 --> 01:22:36,965
Not another word,
and that goes for everyone.

1125
01:22:37,382 --> 01:22:39,882
We will talk to you in the presence
of the Staff Council.

1126
01:22:40,049 --> 01:22:44,340
- Are we being banned from speaking now?
- Stop it. It's not that difficult.

1127
01:22:44,507 --> 01:22:47,090
It's about the framework in
which this takes place.

1128
01:22:47,257 --> 01:22:50,048
Hello! Guys, hey!

1129
01:22:51,174 --> 01:22:53,924
We just ask you to keep your
feet still for a moment.

1130
01:22:54,091 --> 01:22:57,466
We must present a united front.
Even if we disagree.

1131
01:22:57,632 --> 01:23:00,590
- I will not be called a racist.
- That's fine!

1132
01:23:00,757 --> 01:23:03,798
- Milosz, you shouldn't either.
- I get it.

1133
01:23:05,049 --> 01:23:08,340
We should take care of the
students and do our work.

1134
01:23:08,507 --> 01:23:10,090
Let's do our job!

1135
01:23:10,882 --> 01:23:14,715
Let's let the students walk
all over us then.

1136
01:23:14,882 --> 01:23:18,632
You can just leave
your stupid cynicism at home!

1137
01:23:18,799 --> 01:23:22,507
- I'm being called a racist here.
- I get that. Just go.

1138
01:23:23,091 --> 01:23:26,424
- You can't sweep away every problem.
- Just go.

1139
01:23:26,591 --> 01:23:28,091
Just take a deep breath.

1140
01:23:28,257 --> 01:23:30,048
Carla, great. I'm just saying.

1141
01:23:35,716 --> 01:23:37,924
You could
have said something.

1142
01:23:38,716 --> 01:23:40,007
About what?

1143
01:23:40,174 --> 01:23:43,299
- Well, the interview!
- What about Oskar?

1144
01:23:44,049 --> 01:23:45,757
You must forget about that.

1145
01:23:45,924 --> 01:23:50,049
Probably the most important skill
for this job. Thanks for the tip.

1146
01:23:50,216 --> 01:23:53,341
You are also responsible
for the other students.

1147
01:23:59,049 --> 01:24:01,507
Okay guys, sorry I'm late.

1148
01:24:05,299 --> 01:24:07,757
May I ask you to stand
up for a moment?

1149
01:24:10,174 --> 01:24:11,965
I want us... Get up!

1150
01:24:12,424 --> 01:24:16,049
I want us all to shout
as loud as we can.

1151
01:24:16,466 --> 01:24:18,674
Attention. Ready. Go!

1152
01:24:21,174 --> 01:24:23,549
Okay, one more time.
I dare you. All of you. And!

1153
01:24:28,966 --> 01:24:29,966
Again!

1154
01:24:31,882 --> 01:24:32,965
Go on again!

1155
01:24:40,466 --> 01:24:41,924
- Ouch.
- Phew!

1156
01:24:44,799 --> 01:24:45,799
Thank you.

1157
01:24:53,466 --> 01:24:56,174
A few words of clarification
before class:

1158
01:24:59,174 --> 01:25:02,049
You know what happened
in the gym.

1159
01:25:03,382 --> 01:25:07,340
Oskar is now suspended from
school for ten days.

1160
01:25:07,674 --> 01:25:11,215
He's not coming on the school
trip either. Also...

1161
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:17,424
The school magazine has caused some
resentment among the staff.

1162
01:25:19,216 --> 01:25:23,716
The school management have banned
distribution on the school grounds.

1163
01:25:24,132 --> 01:25:25,673
That's censorship!

1164
01:25:25,841 --> 01:25:29,174
I also find it crass that such
measures are being taken.

1165
01:25:29,341 --> 01:25:31,757
I certainly won't hide my newspaper.

1166
01:25:33,716 --> 01:25:36,507
In principle, I think
it's great how you

1167
01:25:36,841 --> 01:25:39,507
are showing solidarity with
the newspaper,

1168
01:25:39,674 --> 01:25:43,507
even if I find the content of
the text highly questionable.

1169
01:25:44,882 --> 01:25:47,632
- Yes?
- I'm sorry. It wasn't against you.

1170
01:25:47,799 --> 01:25:48,799
Thank you, Hatice.

1171
01:25:50,382 --> 01:25:52,257
So, newspapers gone.

1172
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,155
Oskar, what are you doing here?

1173
01:26:05,841 --> 01:26:08,132
Your mother has received a letter.

1174
01:26:08,466 --> 01:26:10,341
- A letter?
- I told you.

1175
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:12,924
I am Oskar! I'm about to run amok!

1176
01:26:13,632 --> 01:26:15,090
Lukas, sit down!

1177
01:26:15,716 --> 01:26:17,966
Let's hear it for Oskar!

1178
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:20,715
Oskar! Oskar!

1179
01:26:22,049 --> 01:26:23,049
Hey!

1180
01:26:25,424 --> 01:26:27,674
Oskar, let's step out for a moment.

1181
01:26:29,424 --> 01:26:30,549
Oskar, come.

1182
01:26:31,007 --> 01:26:32,340
You can't be here.

1183
01:26:35,257 --> 01:26:36,965
You are not allowed to be here.

1184
01:26:37,757 --> 01:26:39,923
- Go home!
- Hey!

1185
01:26:42,257 --> 01:26:44,465
- Vera, will you look after Oskar?
- Yes.

1186
01:26:55,216 --> 01:26:58,507
- We talk about it. I'm not a jerk.
- Good.

1187
01:26:58,882 --> 01:27:01,798
I just want to find a solution.

1188
01:27:02,549 --> 01:27:04,174
Mr. Liebenwerda,

1189
01:27:04,757 --> 01:27:06,507
May I ask for your help?

1190
01:27:15,007 --> 01:27:16,048
Thank you.

1191
01:27:19,882 --> 01:27:22,298
So folks, we're going to move now.

1192
01:27:24,007 --> 01:27:25,757
Pack up your things.

1193
01:27:25,924 --> 01:27:28,965
We go next door.
Mr. Liebenwerda stays with Oskar.

1194
01:27:29,132 --> 01:27:32,090
- Why do we have to go somewhere else?
- No discussion.

1195
01:27:32,257 --> 01:27:34,923
Do what Ms. Nowak said.

1196
01:27:44,882 --> 01:27:45,882
Hey, Oskar.

1197
01:27:47,257 --> 01:27:48,590
This way.

1198
01:27:53,632 --> 01:27:54,840
Please go to...

1199
01:27:55,382 --> 01:27:56,757
Page...

1200
01:27:56,924 --> 01:27:58,132
... 46.

1201
01:27:59,507 --> 01:28:01,423
And take a look at task 13,

1202
01:28:02,132 --> 01:28:03,465
A to F.

1203
01:28:04,216 --> 01:28:05,716
I'll be right back.

1204
01:28:13,507 --> 01:28:16,340
- <i>Kuhn?</i>
- Hello, Ms. Kuhn. Carla Nowak here.

1205
01:28:16,507 --> 01:28:18,382
<i>You have the nerve to call me?</i>

1206
01:28:18,549 --> 01:28:20,812
It's about Oskar. Have
you received the letter?

1207
01:28:20,836 --> 01:28:23,049
<i>Yes. Do you think
we'll let this go through?</i>

1208
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:27,049
You're weaponizing Oskar against
something between the two of us.

1209
01:28:27,216 --> 01:28:29,091
<i>Who is weaponizing whom here?</i>

1210
01:28:29,257 --> 01:28:32,047
<i>Throwing Oskar out of
school solves the problem?</i>

1211
01:28:32,071 --> 01:28:33,132
I defended him.

1212
01:28:33,299 --> 01:28:36,799
- <i>That worked really well.</i>
- You could have come too.

1213
01:28:36,966 --> 01:28:39,632
<i>Now it's my fault?</i>
- It's not about fault...

1214
01:28:40,466 --> 01:28:43,257
- Go back to class.
- We have to go to the bathroom.

1215
01:28:43,424 --> 01:28:46,382
- Then go. But come back quickly.
- Okay.

1216
01:28:46,757 --> 01:28:49,965
- <i>How about an apology?</i>
- Come and pick up Oskar.

1217
01:28:50,188 --> 01:28:53,938
<i>If Oskar wants to, he can
come home himself.</i>

1218
01:28:54,512 --> 01:28:57,762
 We told him to go. But he doesn't listen.

1219
01:28:57,829 --> 01:28:59,138
<i>You can't even do that.</i>

1220
01:28:59,463 --> 01:29:02,463
<i>That's your failure. That's not my problem.</i>

1221
01:29:03,383 --> 01:29:06,549
It's your son. If we fail,
we fail together.

1222
01:29:16,381 --> 01:29:18,256
I can't get through to him.

1223
01:29:19,233 --> 01:29:21,066
Have you contacted the mother?

1224
01:29:21,369 --> 01:29:22,410
And?

1225
01:29:24,347 --> 01:29:26,055
He has a suspension.

1226
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:28,404
We can enforce the rules.

1227
01:29:28,737 --> 01:29:30,320
I want to talk to him first.

1228
01:29:31,034 --> 01:29:32,200
Try it.

1229
01:29:33,246 --> 01:29:35,329
Come on,
you have to go home.

1230
01:29:35,354 --> 01:29:37,604
Otherwise we'll have
to call the police.

1231
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:39,964
Do you understand, Oskar?

1232
01:29:49,936 --> 01:29:51,602
Oskar, will you look at me?

1233
01:30:02,744 --> 01:30:05,244
I wish things had turned
out differently.

1234
01:30:06,869 --> 01:30:09,435
And I'm sorry about what
happened. But if you don't

1235
01:30:09,459 --> 01:30:11,922
go home on your own,
everything will get worse.

1236
01:30:24,992 --> 01:30:27,586
Colleagues, let's go
outside for a moment.

1237
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:37,780
I don't know either.

1238
01:30:42,307 --> 01:30:45,098
Ms. Nowak! What are you doing?

1239
01:33:18,212 --> 01:33:19,878
Aren't you going to answer, Oskar?
