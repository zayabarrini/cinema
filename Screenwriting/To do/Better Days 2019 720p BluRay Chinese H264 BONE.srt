1
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:35,917
Does anyone know the difference
between "was" and "used to be"?

2
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:39,167
Anyone?

3
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:41,501
"Was" means it has passed.

4
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:43,667
In fact, both of them mean
that it has passed.

5
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:46,542
But the difference is that "used to be"

6
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:48,917
carries a sense of loss.

7
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:51,001
Does everybody understand?

8
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:53,459
Let's go over the tenses again.

9
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,751
One, one, two, one!

10
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:52,376
Score above 600!

11
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:53,834
- Score above 600!
- Score above 600!

12
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:56,834
- Get into the university of your dreams!
- Get into the university of your dreams!

13
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:58,126
- Never quit!
- Never quit!

14
00:02:58,209 --> 00:02:59,459
- Never give up!
- Never give up!

15
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:01,167
- Keep calm!
- Keep calm!

16
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:13,501
ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE AWARD
ADVANCED CLASS

17
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:34,959
COUNTDOWN TO NATIONAL COLLEGE
ENTRANCE EXAM: 60 DAYS

18
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:05,959
GRADE TWELVE, SCIENCE, CLASS TEN

19
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:58,209
- Did she jump off the building?
- Is it her?

20
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:24,501
REALLY? WHY?

21
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,334
Really?

22
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:39,042
Stop taking photos!

23
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:40,459
Put your phones away!

24
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:41,959
Everyone, back to your classrooms!

25
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:48,626
OKAY

26
00:06:23,126 --> 00:06:24,292
TOO MUCH PRESSURE?

27
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:28,209
WHAT HAPPENED?

28
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:37,417
SELF-DISCIPLINE,
WORK HARD, NO REGRETS

29
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:44,709
WHY?

30
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:46,001
WHY ELSE?

31
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:16,626
SNOOZE FOR 5 MINUTES

32
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,917
GRADE 12

33
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:56,251
Is Chen Nian here?

34
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,917
Chen Nian.

35
00:07:58,292 --> 00:07:59,376
The teacher asked for you.

36
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,084
Relax.

37
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:06,126
We just need to ask you a few questions.

38
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:08,917
Did Hu Xiaodie

39
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:10,501
say anything to you the day she died?

40
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:13,959
Nothing.

41
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,167
Are you sure?

42
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:18,792
Take your time.

43
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:20,417
Think about it.

44
00:08:25,376 --> 00:08:28,209
I heard you're taking
the college entrance exam this year.

45
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:29,876
You enrolled in a remedial course

46
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,709
to get into
a prestigious university, right?

47
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:35,126
Her old school
wasn't academically up to par.

48
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:42,876
Did Hu Xiaodie have
any close friends in school?

49
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:47,417
Friends aren't necessary here.

50
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:51,209
Do you mean you or her?

51
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:52,834
Just me.

52
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:54,376
I don't know about other people.

53
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:57,001
Suicide is a serious matter.

54
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:00,792
Did she appear emotionally disturbed
to you?

55
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:03,001
Or did something happen to her?

56
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:05,584
Chen Nian.

57
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,501
If you know something, tell us.

58
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:11,584
The school board is highly concerned
about campus safety now.

59
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,667
The school and teachers will protect you.

60
00:09:14,126 --> 00:09:14,959
Don't be afraid.

61
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:19,584
Why did you do it?

62
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:23,792
You said you barely knew her.

63
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:35,709
It's time for class.

64
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:39,667
They can't spare more time.
The exams are approaching.

65
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:42,626
We need your cooperation
in this investigation.

66
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:49,751
Hu Xiaodie...

67
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:52,876
probably wouldn't want

68
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,834
to be seen like that.

69
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:56,001
Didn't you hear the bell?

70
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,126
Rise.

71
00:11:19,084 --> 00:11:20,042
Salute.

72
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:23,376
- Good day, sir.
- Good day, sir.

73
00:11:23,876 --> 00:11:24,709
Sit.

74
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:28,542
What's wrong?

75
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:33,834
Who did this?

76
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:37,584
The exam is almost here!

77
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:38,834
There is no time for pranks!

78
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:44,126
Also, try to get along
with your classmates.

79
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:48,001
If you are being bullied,
you must tell me.

80
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:49,376
Okay?

81
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,417
- Hello, sir.
- Hold on.

82
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:53,334
- Okay.
- I'll deal with your child later.

83
00:11:54,084 --> 00:11:55,417
I am your teacher.

84
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:57,876
I care about your grades
as well as your life.

85
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:01,167
Is your mom home yet?

86
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:04,417
No.

87
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,376
Okay, go back to class.

88
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:12,042
PEKING UNIVERSITY,
TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY

89
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:20,626
The child will have her exam soon.
Someone must be home.

90
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,376
- Zhou Lei!
- I know you're in there!

91
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:38,751
Stop hiding! Open the door!

92
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,959
I know you're inside! Open up!

93
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:41,876
Zhou Lei!

94
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:43,417
Open the door!

95
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:46,876
- Zhou Lei!
- Pay us back!

96
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:09,126
Want stewed pork dumplings?

97
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:12,001
What? Stewed pork dumplings?

98
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,792
Stop pushing me.

99
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:17,584
Chen Nian is over there.

100
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:20,667
Let's go over to her.

101
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:25,542
Hi. We're coming in.

102
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:31,959
Your ranking went up again this week.

103
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:35,167
What?

104
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:37,917
How did you manage to do so well?

105
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:40,042
Want to join our study group?

106
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:43,751
Why not?

107
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,751
I want to ask you a few English questions.

108
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:48,626
I don't have time.

109
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:50,667
No time? Really?

110
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:52,626
She just doesn't want
to waste time on you.

111
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:53,959
Nonsense.

112
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,667
Chen Nian is not so petty.

113
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,084
She's a nice person

114
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:59,209
and she's good to her classmates.

115
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:01,001
Isn't that right, Chen Nian?

116
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,667
Let me take your picture.

117
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:15,501
Chen Nian!

118
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:42,209
Hey, are you okay?

119
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:45,667
Don't worry.

120
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,459
We just want to show our appreciation.

121
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:49,751
When you covered up Xiaodie's body
the other day,

122
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:51,584
I was so touched.

123
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:56,959
But when you talked to the police,

124
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:58,792
I wasn't so touched anymore.

125
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:03,292
So what did you tell them?

126
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:28,417
Mom, I've told you before.

127
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:30,417
Don't open the curtains.
The creditors will show up.

128
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:32,459
Where were you? You're back so late.

129
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:34,209
Hey.

130
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:37,751
Where did you find this?

131
00:15:38,376 --> 00:15:41,792
- I've been searching for it all day.
- Isn't the mask contraband?

132
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:45,292
It won't perform miracles,
but it won't kill you.

133
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:49,334
What actually happened?

134
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:51,917
- Let's listen to the interviews.
- Mom!

135
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,834
When the emergency...

136
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,001
DELIVERY ORDER

137
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:05,167
Are there a lot?

138
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:08,667
Not really.

139
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:13,001
So this is how hair turns grey overnight.

140
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:15,334
Yet, you keep selling illegal goods.

141
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,042
I'm a victim too.

142
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,584
The area I picked isn't bad.

143
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:24,501
When I get my cut,

144
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,584
you'll get your college tuition.

145
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,667
How are your studies?

146
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:30,126
Good.

147
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:32,376
My test scores this month
are among the top ten.

148
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:40,834
I know I'm not a good mom.

149
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,751
Be patient.

150
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:46,917
Once you graduate from college,
we'll escape this hellhole.

151
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:50,459
I know I owe you.

152
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:21,292
Boys, help the girls.

153
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:23,334
I don't know why you're laughing.

154
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,417
I do hope you'll be happy
after the college entrance exam.

155
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:27,584
Let me tell you.

156
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:30,459
Being placed in the last row doesn't
determine your future social position,

157
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,501
but you will have a hard life.

158
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:37,126
If you want an easier life,
you better start working hard now.

159
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:39,584
Some of you have scored consistently well,

160
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,876
so they deserve praise.

161
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,834
Wei Lai, keep it up.

162
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,001
Thank you, sir.

163
00:17:44,084 --> 00:17:45,292
Luo Jun.

164
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:48,501
I worry I'll be seeing you again
next year.

165
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,876
- Now!
- Mess him up!

166
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,251
- Come on!
- How dare you beat up my brother?

167
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:08,667
You're telling me to go to hell?
You can go first!

168
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:09,626
Bottle!

169
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:13,417
Bastard!

170
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:14,417
Get up!

171
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:15,792
Weren't you so tough?

172
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:19,501
Someone's getting beaten up by a gang...

173
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:21,459
Come here!

174
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:28,167
Hey, she called the police.

175
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:33,751
Is he your boyfriend?

176
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:35,292
Speak the hell up!

177
00:18:35,376 --> 00:18:36,959
- Speak up!
- No.

178
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:38,667
Then why did you call the police?

179
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,001
Crazy bitch!

180
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:43,417
Give me your bag!

181
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:49,209
Fifty yuan?

182
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:50,751
Give me your phone.

183
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:53,792
- I said, give me your phone!
- Hey!

184
00:18:55,209 --> 00:18:56,834
She's just a girl.

185
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:00,459
I get it now.

186
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:01,542
Get him.

187
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:02,917
This bitch likes him.

188
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:05,417
She has a crush on him and wants to help.

189
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:07,292
Make her kiss this mad dog!

190
00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:08,584
Kiss him!

191
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:09,959
Kiss him!

192
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:11,834
- Do it!
- Hurry up!

193
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,876
- Are you deaf?
- I'm letting you kiss him.

194
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:17,917
- Didn't you hear me?
- Do you have a death wish?

195
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:19,334
Hurry and kiss him!

196
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,542
Kiss him!

197
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:22,167
Do you want him to die?

198
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:23,876
Still won't kiss him?

199
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:25,834
Do it!

200
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:36,501
She really did it!

201
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:37,751
She kissed him!

202
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:40,042
How dare you mess with my brother?

203
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:42,626
- They kissed!
- Who are you?

204
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:50,251
Brother!

205
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:51,626
Brother, are you all right?

206
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,042
This is not over!

207
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:07,959
How much did they take?

208
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:11,917
- Answer me.
- Fifty yuan.

209
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:17,876
I don't have any change.

210
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:22,251
Beishan!

211
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:24,001
Give me your phone.

212
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,542
I thought we're here for change.

213
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:29,292
You have to buy something first.

214
00:21:29,376 --> 00:21:33,876
MOBILE PHONE REPAIR

215
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:38,709
This will cost 200 yuan.

216
00:21:39,626 --> 00:21:41,334
- What?
- I'm not scamming you.

217
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,542
It needs major repairs.

218
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:45,501
The parts alone cost 150 yuan.

219
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:50,084
Okay.

220
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:51,584
Give me 50 yuan back.

221
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:52,834
Fine.

222
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,667
You're so cheap.

223
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:56,209
If you don't want to pay the service fee,

224
00:21:56,626 --> 00:21:58,001
you can fix it yourself.

225
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:22,917
- You can fix phones?
- I deal in stolen phone parts.

226
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:31,959
You had it repaired before?

227
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:39,126
Most of the original parts were replaced.

228
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:40,834
You didn't watch the repair?

229
00:22:41,334 --> 00:22:42,667
They probably stole your data too.

230
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:44,834
I don't have any important data.

231
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,334
Fool.

232
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:50,917
You're a perfect target.

233
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:54,001
Look.

234
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:57,084
If you pay me,

235
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,501
I can protect you.

236
00:22:59,084 --> 00:23:00,542
You can't even protect yourself.

237
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:01,792
How can you protect me?

238
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:07,834
Getting beat up is nothing.

239
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:10,376
I always get even in the end.

240
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:12,917
Carry on fighting.

241
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:15,292
I'm going to the best university
in the country,

242
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:16,876
unlike you.

243
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:22,667
How are we different?

244
00:23:24,126 --> 00:23:25,584
Don't you see?

245
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:27,917
Either you bully others

246
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:29,959
or you get bullied.

247
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,542
So which kind are you?

248
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,751
Is your house to the left or right?

249
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:55,501
You don't have to escort me.

250
00:24:16,626 --> 00:24:17,834
What's your name?

251
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,209
You can't tell me even
after we've kissed?

252
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:34,459
Hey!

253
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:37,626
POLICE

254
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:39,001
Pull down your hood.

255
00:24:44,376 --> 00:24:46,334
- How did you get hurt?
- Is it a crime?

256
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:47,709
Just answer the question.

257
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:49,209
Show me your ID.

258
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:32,751
LIAR EXPOSED!
DON'T TRUST THIS CROOK

259
00:25:48,751 --> 00:25:49,876
Wow, look at this!

260
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:52,417
"Your daughter is still in school."

261
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:56,209
"It won't look good
if we take it to court."

262
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:16,251
LIAR EXPOSED!
DON'T TRUST THIS CROOK

263
00:26:34,501 --> 00:26:35,417
Chen Nian!

264
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:37,334
Liu Yiping from Class 5
wants to buy a facial mask!

265
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:39,709
Shut up! Enough already!

266
00:26:43,376 --> 00:26:45,584
THE SMART ALWAYS FIND WAYS

267
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:47,709
THE FOOLISH TRAP THEMSELVES

268
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:11,626
- Where to?
- Wherever.

269
00:28:33,251 --> 00:28:34,251
Sit.

270
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:35,626
Shut the door.

271
00:29:08,126 --> 00:29:10,459
I HAVE MONEY TO HELP YOU
AND YOUR MOM

272
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:20,959
Are you fighting with your boyfriend?

273
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,751
Why come here if you have one?

274
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:32,001
POWER OFF

275
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:43,292
- Do you like me?
- What is there to like?

276
00:29:55,042 --> 00:29:56,709
I never even considered it.

277
00:29:59,376 --> 00:30:00,959
Then why follow me home?

278
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,834
I didn't expect you to bring me here.

279
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:09,167
Is my place too shabby for you?

280
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:15,126
Don't worry.

281
00:30:15,334 --> 00:30:16,584
I don't intend to sleep with you.

282
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:18,459
Then why bring it up?

283
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,042
I did consider it though.

284
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:24,001
Are you sure you want to continue?

285
00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:25,126
I'm just making small talk.

286
00:30:25,209 --> 00:30:27,292
Did anybody ever teach you manners?

287
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:49,917
Are you scared now?

288
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:53,459
I'm just a punk.

289
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:56,542
Why should I bother with manners?

290
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:01,209
Class is over.

291
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:02,792
You can go and study if you wish.

292
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:04,501
Put the balls back when you leave.

293
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:11,001
My mom said,

294
00:32:11,084 --> 00:32:12,876
"Like mom, like daughter.

295
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,626
Like a chip off the old block."

296
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:16,751
You must be exhausted
from paying off your mom's debt.

297
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,626
How can you even play today?

298
00:32:28,376 --> 00:32:29,959
Are you done?

299
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:51,792
Chen Nian.

300
00:32:51,876 --> 00:32:53,626
- Chen Nian.
- Chen Nian.

301
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:55,209
Are you all right?

302
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:56,584
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

303
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:57,709
Are you okay?

304
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:11,376
Be careful
when using the stairs next time.

305
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:13,459
Keep your wound dry.

306
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:14,959
You're good to go.

307
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:33,084
Just one more month

308
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,792
and we can go to Beijing.

309
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,751
What if I can't hold out?

310
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:40,084
Like Hu Xiaodie?

311
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:44,251
She was weak.

312
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,751
She let those people affect her.

313
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:50,251
She wasn't the only weak one.

314
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:53,292
Both of us are weak too.

315
00:34:15,209 --> 00:34:17,167
They've been bullying me all along.

316
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:20,376
Why didn't any of you do anything?

317
00:34:34,334 --> 00:34:36,251
Hello, Officer Zheng?

318
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:48,334
That's absurd.

319
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:50,042
I don't even remember it.

320
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:53,042
I'm afraid of ghosts.

321
00:34:54,376 --> 00:34:56,126
Hu Xiaodie was a slut.

322
00:34:57,501 --> 00:34:58,917
Everyone hated her.

323
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,167
Why single us out?

324
00:35:00,251 --> 00:35:01,334
What about Chen Nian?

325
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:03,501
Didn't you push her down the stairs?

326
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:06,709
Tell me how you bullied her.

327
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:08,459
You believe her?

328
00:35:08,626 --> 00:35:09,917
I know nothing.

329
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:11,709
We're good friends with Chen Nian.

330
00:35:11,792 --> 00:35:14,292
We play pranks on
each other all the time.

331
00:35:14,376 --> 00:35:15,584
- Just now...
- Pranks?

332
00:35:17,751 --> 00:35:20,959
So what prank did you play
that pushed Hu Xiaodie to suicide?

333
00:35:21,292 --> 00:35:22,376
Do you have any proof?

334
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:24,376
Would you be here if I didn't?

335
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,417
It was her choice to kill herself.

336
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:31,042
I had nothing to do with it.

337
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:33,042
She didn't want to repeat the course.

338
00:35:33,126 --> 00:35:35,417
Her mom forced her to take lessons.
Her grades were terrible.

339
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:38,251
The teacher said third-tier
colleges were her best hope.

340
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:40,792
Maybe she was under
too much pressure.

341
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:43,292
Don't you feel even a
tiny bit of remorse?

342
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:48,084
Who's calling me?

343
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:49,626
Your mom.

344
00:35:50,209 --> 00:35:53,126
Your parents should see you now.

345
00:35:53,376 --> 00:35:54,334
Answer it.

346
00:35:57,917 --> 00:35:59,334
If you've already told them,

347
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:01,792
why ask me all this bullshit?

348
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:04,251
I didn't do anything.

349
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:05,751
Even if my mom comes,

350
00:36:05,834 --> 00:36:07,959
I won't give them a penny.

351
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:12,542
Maybe it's good that Hu Xiaodie died.

352
00:36:12,626 --> 00:36:15,292
How else would her mom get
such a big payout?

353
00:36:15,376 --> 00:36:18,209
If she sues,
she might even get a half million!

354
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:21,126
Even if she didn't die
and went to college.

355
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:24,459
it would've taken her years
to earn that much.

356
00:37:02,251 --> 00:37:04,626
There's something I want to tell you.

357
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:09,626
School bullying cases are rather tricky.

358
00:37:09,834 --> 00:37:13,334
You can't file charges
without concrete evidence.

359
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:17,042
In the end, the Ministry of Education
always intervenes.

360
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:18,917
More witnesses will come forward.

361
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:21,167
Why did you bully others
when you were young?

362
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:22,542
I didn't.

363
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,959
Then you were bullied.

364
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:27,417
I don't smoke.

365
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:30,834
Empathy only comes with age.

366
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,917
You just tend to forget
your wrongdoings.

367
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,751
We weren't nearly as bad as
they are now.

368
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:39,209
It's quite common now.

369
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:40,834
Not long ago,

370
00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:42,542
a group of senior high students

371
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:45,667
beat a classmate to death.

372
00:37:46,084 --> 00:37:47,584
When I took their statements,

373
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:50,126
none of them thought

374
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:52,792
that a person could be
beaten to death.

375
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:57,417
Just because these cases
happen on campus,

376
00:37:57,917 --> 00:38:00,501
doesn't mean it
doesn't spread off-campus.

377
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:02,959
If you try talking to the principal,

378
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:05,084
he'll pass it on to the teachers

379
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:08,167
who will then pass it
on to the parents.

380
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:10,626
Then the parent will say,
"I work in Shenzhen.

381
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:12,792
I only see my kid once a year."

382
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:14,501
Who else is left?

383
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:19,917
No matter what, we are the police.

384
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:22,834
We must try our best to help.

385
00:38:28,376 --> 00:38:29,751
Please give her another chance.

386
00:38:30,126 --> 00:38:32,042
I'm begging you.

387
00:38:32,751 --> 00:38:35,209
- I'll kneel!
- Mom!

388
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:37,542
Xiaomiao, come and kneel!

389
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:39,334
- Don't kneel!
- Beg your teacher! Beg him!

390
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,334
- Plead to the teacher.
- Please get up.

391
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:43,042
- Please reinvestigate!
- What are you doing?

392
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:45,167
- Please reinvestigate!
- Get off me!

393
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:46,417
Don't get physical!

394
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:48,417
This is a school! Behave yourself!

395
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:50,001
- Get back inside.
- Please get up.

396
00:38:50,084 --> 00:38:52,084
- Please help us.
- Get up.

397
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:53,626
It's all your fault!

398
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,126
- Who are you? Stop!
- Don't stop me!

399
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:56,667
Call security!

400
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,292
Why can't you study?

401
00:38:58,376 --> 00:38:59,876
Don't! Stop!

402
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:01,584
You have no right to do that!

403
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,209
Is this how you parent your child?

404
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:04,542
This is ridiculous!

405
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:06,709
They've all been suspended.

406
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:10,876
But they'll still attend
the college entrance exam.

407
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:14,542
They're still young.

408
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:17,209
We want to give them a second chance.

409
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:20,251
Try to get past this.

410
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:21,751
Don't let this distract you.

411
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:28,876
Chen Nian.

412
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:32,834
You did the right thing.

413
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:37,209
Trust that you did the right thing.

414
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,001
There will always be
shadows on the path,

415
00:39:40,292 --> 00:39:42,501
but when you look up,
you will always see the light.

416
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:46,542
I'm responsible for all of this too.

417
00:39:49,626 --> 00:39:51,334
You'll get a new homeroom teacher.

418
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,584
Chen Nian!

419
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:25,751
Are you disappointed in me?

420
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,251
I'm disappointed too.

421
00:40:30,501 --> 00:40:31,751
But who can I blame?

422
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:37,376
- We did the best we could...
- But you know the truth, right?

423
00:40:51,376 --> 00:40:52,917
Up until I was 18 years old,

424
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:54,542
I didn't like to sleep.

425
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:57,042
My high school teacher told me

426
00:40:57,126 --> 00:40:59,542
to try for the police academy
or a medical school.

427
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:02,209
Both professions require
working at night.

428
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:04,792
I did what she said
and became a cop.

429
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:05,917
I gradually

430
00:41:06,626 --> 00:41:08,542
came to appreciate sleep.

431
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,001
Do you know why?

432
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:16,167
There are people and things
I would rather not see.

433
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:18,334
We're not that kind of family.

434
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,709
Her dad and I always teach her

435
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:23,834
principles and moral values.

436
00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:25,917
What kind of people to befriend

437
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:27,084
and how to befriend others.

438
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:28,542
They're essential social skills.

439
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:30,876
There are things
other kids don't even consider

440
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:33,167
that she needs to consider

441
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:34,959
because she's special.

442
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:39,001
Things aren't always what they seem.

443
00:41:39,084 --> 00:41:40,167
For instance,

444
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:41,626
what's the background of the parents?

445
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:44,292
Why was the child emotionally disturbed?

446
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,501
Shouldn't the school take responsibility?

447
00:41:46,584 --> 00:41:49,209
Moreover, everything requires proof.

448
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:52,501
Should we get to the bottom of it,
things will turn ugly.

449
00:41:53,251 --> 00:41:55,459
Have you ever seen
the eyes of wild animals

450
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:58,376
just before they're killed?

451
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:00,501
My child is still young and naive.

452
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:03,167
It's hard to say
who the innocent one is here.

453
00:42:03,251 --> 00:42:04,917
They have no expression.

454
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:06,959
None at all.

455
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:11,334
It's because they're afraid.

456
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,917
You can see it in their eyes.

457
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,959
You don't need to be
afraid anymore.

458
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,501
Concentrate on the
college entrance exam.

459
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:22,626
Right.

460
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:25,626
Once the exam is over,
we become adults.

461
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:30,834
My mom said

462
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:32,751
that the advantage
of getting older is that

463
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:34,334
you begin to forget things.

464
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:38,209
Don't let anything affect you.

465
00:42:38,417 --> 00:42:39,834
You forget it all in the end.

466
00:42:41,251 --> 00:42:44,751
However, what they don't teach you is

467
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:46,709
how to be an adult.

468
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:56,917
Chen Nian,

469
00:42:57,376 --> 00:42:58,667
listen to me.

470
00:42:59,251 --> 00:43:00,792
Growing up is like diving.

471
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:04,667
Don't think.
Just close your eyes and jump in.

472
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:08,167
There will be sand, rocks, and clams
in the river.

473
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:12,167
That's how we all grow up.

474
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,084
Nian, are you home?

475
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:27,376
Have you eaten?

476
00:43:31,084 --> 00:43:31,917
Yes.

477
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:35,417
I ran into some trouble.

478
00:43:35,876 --> 00:43:38,001
Some people had allergic reactions
to the masks.

479
00:43:38,251 --> 00:43:39,834
They make a scene here every day.

480
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:46,501
Hello?

481
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,667
Then come home. Just quit.

482
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:52,917
I can't make money back home.

483
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:54,792
Not to mention the creditors.

484
00:43:55,042 --> 00:43:57,792
You're safer at home without me.

485
00:43:57,876 --> 00:43:59,209
You're a child.

486
00:43:59,292 --> 00:44:00,626
They won't do anything to you.

487
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:06,292
Hello?

488
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:12,042
Do you have enough money?

489
00:44:12,626 --> 00:44:13,917
Yes, I do.

490
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:16,167
Doesn't the mask give you a rash?

491
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:18,167
I can't let it go to waste.

492
00:44:18,251 --> 00:44:20,084
Don't blame me if anything happens.

493
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:21,417
I won't.

494
00:44:21,584 --> 00:44:23,917
You want one? Buy it yourself.

495
00:44:24,001 --> 00:44:26,584
Once I make it to Beijing,
everything will be fine.

496
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:30,626
Let's open a small shop
in front of the university.

497
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:33,376
I'll bring students to our store.

498
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:36,251
Let's make money off my classmates.

499
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:40,709
All right. That's my girl.

500
00:44:41,126 --> 00:44:43,001
I know I can count on you.

501
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:46,292
Listen, you're amazing.

502
00:44:46,376 --> 00:44:47,917
So am I.

503
00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:49,876
We're reincarnations of the Monkey King.

504
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:51,334
We're both undefeatable.

505
00:44:56,334 --> 00:44:57,959
It's nearly dawn.

506
00:44:58,667 --> 00:45:00,501
Don't screw up now.

507
00:45:00,584 --> 00:45:01,917
Okay?

508
00:45:02,001 --> 00:45:03,376
I heard you.

509
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:04,709
Trust me.

510
00:45:06,126 --> 00:45:07,834
- Keep it up.
- Sure.

511
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:12,834
I'm hanging up.

512
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:14,376
Sleep early.

513
00:45:17,209 --> 00:45:18,584
I'm hanging up for real.

514
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:40,542
We should all stand up against bullying.

515
00:45:40,626 --> 00:45:43,459
If anyone should seek help,

516
00:45:43,542 --> 00:45:45,751
the school will take the matter
seriously!

517
00:45:45,834 --> 00:45:47,917
COUNTDOWN TO NATIONAL COLLEGE
ENTRANCE EXAM: 43 DAYS

518
00:45:48,084 --> 00:45:50,060
The entrance exam is very stressful,

519
00:45:50,084 --> 00:45:52,709
but the students' well-being
is our priority.

520
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,001
The school will strengthen
its counseling service.

521
00:45:55,084 --> 00:45:58,334
Please approach the counselor
if you have any questions.

522
00:45:58,417 --> 00:46:00,209
We must persist!

523
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:02,792
It's you against the world!

524
00:46:03,126 --> 00:46:06,459
Only if you can stand your ground,
will you prevail!

525
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:08,626
We are not afraid, right?

526
00:46:08,709 --> 00:46:10,459
- Yes.
- Yes.

527
00:46:11,626 --> 00:46:12,626
Class dismissed.

528
00:46:16,959 --> 00:46:18,876
What kind of replacement is he?

529
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:21,001
He's horrible.

530
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:29,459
Students, you'll be graduating soon!

531
00:46:29,959 --> 00:46:33,334
You're entering
the first stage of your life.

532
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:34,459
Are you happy?

533
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,917
- Yes!
- Yes!

534
00:46:37,001 --> 00:46:38,292
Let's take a picture!

535
00:46:39,876 --> 00:46:41,084
You're graduating!

536
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:42,209
Smile!

537
00:46:42,292 --> 00:46:43,376
- Smile!
- Look here!

538
00:46:43,459 --> 00:46:45,751
Three, two, one, say cheese!

539
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:48,334
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

540
00:47:25,292 --> 00:47:26,876
You dared to call the cops.

541
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:29,376
Why don't you follow in
Hu Xiaodie's footsteps?

542
00:47:30,251 --> 00:47:31,126
Die!

543
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:37,917
Chen Nian,
why are you in such a hurry to die?

544
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:53,834
Why are you running?

545
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:57,959
Where are you going?

546
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,167
Stop running!

547
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,876
You think you can escape?

548
00:48:01,834 --> 00:48:02,667
Stop!

549
00:48:04,167 --> 00:48:05,126
Stop running!

550
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:16,042
Stop running!

551
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:23,459
That way!

552
00:48:54,292 --> 00:48:55,542
Did you see her?

553
00:48:59,084 --> 00:49:00,042
Go to her house!

554
00:49:00,126 --> 00:49:01,709
She'll go home eventually.

555
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,876
OFFICER ZHENG

556
00:49:26,209 --> 00:49:27,959
I couldn't take your call
during interrogation.

557
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:29,667
What's the matter?

558
00:49:30,126 --> 00:49:32,167
Zheng Yi, he's talking. Come back in.

559
00:49:35,876 --> 00:49:37,042
Chen Nian?

560
00:49:37,459 --> 00:49:39,209
I'm sorry, I misdialed.

561
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:57,876
Can you protect me?

562
00:51:03,834 --> 00:51:05,626
I don't have money to pay you.

563
00:51:07,876 --> 00:51:09,709
But I must go to Beijing.

564
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:24,667
Don't move.

565
00:52:02,459 --> 00:52:03,542
Do you feel hot?

566
00:52:06,876 --> 00:52:08,001
What did you say?

567
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,959
Do you feel hot?

568
00:52:14,917 --> 00:52:16,126
No.

569
00:52:19,376 --> 00:52:20,959
Is it hard?

570
00:52:22,501 --> 00:52:23,542
What?

571
00:52:24,251 --> 00:52:27,084
Is the couch hard?

572
00:52:31,626 --> 00:52:32,876
No.

573
00:52:45,834 --> 00:52:47,834
Didn't you look down on me?

574
00:53:11,042 --> 00:53:12,334
Give me your notebook.

575
00:53:12,876 --> 00:53:13,751
What?

576
00:53:14,376 --> 00:53:15,959
Give me your notebook.

577
00:53:21,417 --> 00:53:23,126
Bring a pen too.

578
00:53:30,709 --> 00:53:32,001
Write here.

579
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:33,792
Chen Nian owes Beishan one.

580
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:41,084
I haven't specified what it is.

581
00:53:41,417 --> 00:53:42,792
Maybe it's just a meal.

582
00:53:49,959 --> 00:53:52,501
CHEN NIAN OWES
BEISHAN ONE FOR...

583
00:53:55,334 --> 00:53:56,667
Maybe not a meal.

584
00:53:57,251 --> 00:53:58,626
It could be something else.

585
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:05,251
You have to get up early.

586
00:55:39,209 --> 00:55:40,042
Hey.

587
00:55:52,959 --> 00:55:54,042
Don't touch Chen Nian.

588
00:56:12,667 --> 00:56:13,834
Watch him.

589
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:18,751
Where's the money?

590
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:28,542
What are you looking at?

591
00:56:28,626 --> 00:56:30,626
You have some guts coming here!

592
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:35,667
Pay up for the last job.

593
00:56:37,584 --> 00:56:41,626
Grade 12 students, raise your right hand

594
00:56:41,709 --> 00:56:43,167
and take the oath!

595
00:56:44,417 --> 00:56:45,667
I vow...

596
00:56:45,834 --> 00:56:47,459
- "I vow..."
- "I vow..."

597
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:49,917
- I will not fail my parents!
- I will not fail my parents!

598
00:56:50,001 --> 00:56:51,917
I will not disappoint my teachers!

599
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:53,167
- "I will not..."
- "I will not..."

600
00:56:53,251 --> 00:56:55,042
You still owe me money!

601
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:56,917
Get lost!

602
00:56:58,459 --> 00:57:00,501
I will smile confidently...

603
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:04,459
- ...as I strive for success and glory!
- ...as I strive for success and glory!

604
00:57:04,542 --> 00:57:05,876
COUNTDOWN TO NCEE: 32 DAYS

605
00:57:05,959 --> 00:57:07,501
WORK HARD, NO REGRETS

606
00:57:07,584 --> 00:57:09,501
A plus B...

607
00:57:16,042 --> 00:57:17,084
Six bamboo.

608
00:57:20,876 --> 00:57:21,876
Three characters.

609
00:57:27,084 --> 00:57:28,126
Five characters.

610
00:57:29,542 --> 00:57:30,792
Five characters again.

611
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:40,209
Couldn't do it?

612
00:57:40,292 --> 00:57:41,584
Then you can't eat tonight!

613
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:12,917
What are you memorizing?

614
00:58:13,501 --> 00:58:14,626
A composition.

615
00:58:14,834 --> 00:58:16,167
What for?

616
00:58:16,376 --> 00:58:18,542
Our teacher can predict exam topics.

617
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:21,334
Predict?

618
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:28,959
Don't tell me.

619
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:30,959
I don't want to know.

620
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:37,417
Why don't you go to school?

621
00:58:38,542 --> 00:58:40,501
- It's useless.
- It's not.

622
00:58:43,876 --> 00:58:45,251
It's useful for you,

623
00:58:46,876 --> 00:58:48,251
but useless for me.

624
00:58:48,751 --> 00:58:50,001
Bunch of punks.

625
00:58:50,501 --> 00:58:52,209
You dare to cause a scene in my joint?

626
00:58:52,917 --> 00:58:55,084
I'll do your parents a favor
and set things right.

627
00:58:55,834 --> 00:58:57,709
Don't you like to fight?

628
00:58:57,792 --> 00:58:59,084
What are you waiting for?

629
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:00,001
Fight!

630
00:59:14,126 --> 00:59:15,501
You're too pure.

631
00:59:16,209 --> 00:59:17,501
You don't get it.

632
00:59:23,751 --> 00:59:25,292
Who's protecting you?

633
00:59:25,501 --> 00:59:27,126
Can he protect me too?

634
00:59:37,501 --> 00:59:39,209
Why is it my turn?

635
00:59:39,751 --> 00:59:42,501
I did everything they said.

636
00:59:51,667 --> 00:59:53,834
I'll walk you home.

637
01:01:04,917 --> 01:01:06,167
Does it hurt?

638
01:01:08,626 --> 01:01:09,792
I'm used to it.

639
01:01:17,251 --> 01:01:18,751
Since when?

640
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:24,001
Since I was 13.

641
01:01:30,501 --> 01:01:31,876
My dad left us.

642
01:01:34,001 --> 01:01:36,251
My mom was burdened with me.

643
01:01:37,501 --> 01:01:39,167
She couldn't handle it.

644
01:01:41,126 --> 01:01:43,084
She later met a man.

645
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:48,001
I woke up one morning...

646
01:01:50,376 --> 01:01:52,667
to find that she came home
with some meat buns.

647
01:01:56,084 --> 01:01:57,292
I was so happy.

648
01:01:59,542 --> 01:02:01,542
Meat buns were a rare treat.

649
01:02:04,626 --> 01:02:06,417
But as soon as I started eating,

650
01:02:08,667 --> 01:02:10,334
she slapped me.

651
01:02:12,667 --> 01:02:14,084
While crying hard.

652
01:02:27,501 --> 01:02:29,001
That man dumped her

653
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:32,501
because of me.

654
01:02:38,959 --> 01:02:42,167
Did she eventually get married?

655
01:02:49,917 --> 01:02:51,584
I went back to look for her.

656
01:02:54,334 --> 01:02:55,709
But she had moved.

657
01:03:13,792 --> 01:03:14,876
Chen Nian?

658
01:03:20,417 --> 01:03:22,751
You're the first person
to ask me if it hurts.

659
01:03:41,709 --> 01:03:42,834
Hello.

660
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:43,876
Thank you.

661
01:03:50,667 --> 01:03:52,334
Are you being stalked lately?

662
01:03:55,292 --> 01:03:56,751
I'm heading out for a bit.

663
01:03:57,084 --> 01:03:59,959
It's not the first time
I've seen someone following you.

664
01:04:24,542 --> 01:04:27,334
Can university graduates earn
five grand a month?

665
01:04:28,001 --> 01:04:30,001
More than that.
At least more than thirty grand.

666
01:04:35,626 --> 01:04:37,209
Can we make that much?

667
01:04:37,626 --> 01:04:38,584
Look at us.

668
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:41,126
We don't steal or deal drugs.

669
01:04:41,417 --> 01:04:43,417
How can we ever make that much?

670
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:49,334
But you're good-looking.

671
01:04:49,667 --> 01:04:51,251
You could sell your body.

672
01:05:00,334 --> 01:05:02,251
Maybe I'm not who you think I am.

673
01:05:02,876 --> 01:05:04,376
What did you say?

674
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:08,042
I ignored Hu Xiaodie

675
01:05:08,126 --> 01:05:10,001
because she wanted to be my friend.

676
01:05:10,709 --> 01:05:12,126
I actually liked her.

677
01:05:15,042 --> 01:05:16,042
Don't you realize

678
01:05:16,126 --> 01:05:18,209
that I don't deserve your kindness?

679
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,792
What did you just say?

680
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:33,584
It's coming!

681
01:05:40,459 --> 01:05:41,667
Focus.

682
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:45,876
What are you doing?

683
01:05:56,042 --> 01:05:58,417
Do you want

684
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:01,126
to get away from here together?

685
01:06:06,751 --> 01:06:07,876
How?

686
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:25,001
There must be a way.

687
01:06:25,084 --> 01:06:28,584
One day, we'll walk proudly
in broad daylight for the world to see.

688
01:06:37,084 --> 01:06:38,834
Come!

689
01:06:39,459 --> 01:06:40,667
- Swerve!
- Come!

690
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:42,542
- Medic!
- Shoot!

691
01:06:42,626 --> 01:06:43,501
Everyone, stay calm!

692
01:06:43,584 --> 01:06:45,042
- Don't run.
- Don't move!

693
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,834
- Don't move.
- What's happening?

694
01:06:46,917 --> 01:06:48,876
- Raise your head!
- I am talking to you!

695
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,376
- Come!
- Stand up!

696
01:06:50,459 --> 01:06:51,917
- You!
- What's up?

697
01:06:52,001 --> 01:06:53,584
- You! And you!
- Stand up!

698
01:06:53,667 --> 01:06:55,126
- You three, come with me.
- Officer.

699
01:06:55,209 --> 01:06:57,126
- Stand up.
- We are really good students.

700
01:06:57,209 --> 01:06:58,751
- Get in line!
- Come on!

701
01:06:58,834 --> 01:07:00,584
- One by one, move forward!
- Where to?

702
01:07:00,667 --> 01:07:02,001
- Stand up.
- Walk.

703
01:07:02,167 --> 01:07:03,209
- We got a tip-off.
- Move it.

704
01:07:03,292 --> 01:07:05,584
Someone reported seeing
a suspected rapist here.

705
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:07,042
- Move.
- Please cooperate.

706
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:25,834
How long will this take?

707
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,251
Who knows?

708
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:28,917
They're looking for a rapist.

709
01:07:29,001 --> 01:07:30,751
A girl is here to identify him.

710
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:32,584
Then why did you run?

711
01:07:33,042 --> 01:07:35,292
I thought you were the cafe manager.

712
01:07:36,876 --> 01:07:39,459
- What time is it?
- I clearly don't look like a rapist.

713
01:07:39,542 --> 01:07:40,709
I'm asking you!

714
01:07:40,792 --> 01:07:43,792
- It's more likely that I was raped.
- Nobody would want to rape you.

715
01:07:44,542 --> 01:07:46,001
When will you release us?

716
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:47,917
It's not your first time.

717
01:07:48,001 --> 01:07:49,626
It'll be done when it's done.

718
01:08:09,626 --> 01:08:12,126
The number you called is
temporarily unavailable.

719
01:08:18,042 --> 01:08:19,792
Shut up if you want to live.

720
01:08:23,751 --> 01:08:25,334
Shut up if you want to live!

721
01:08:25,584 --> 01:08:26,834
Be serious!

722
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:28,042
Next!

723
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:33,251
Shut up if you want to live!

724
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:41,917
Shut up

725
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:44,334
if you want to live!

726
01:08:44,584 --> 01:08:46,042
Be serious!

727
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:48,751
Officer, can I try again?

728
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:51,042
Put on the masks we gave you.

729
01:08:51,834 --> 01:08:53,126
Stand up straight!

730
01:08:55,626 --> 01:08:57,834
The number you called is
temporarily unavailable.

731
01:09:20,917 --> 01:09:22,709
- Here comes the bitch!
- You're the bitch!

732
01:09:22,876 --> 01:09:23,959
Again!

733
01:09:24,042 --> 01:09:25,167
Dodge!

734
01:09:25,667 --> 01:09:26,876
- Bitch!
- Bitch!

735
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:29,751
- Slap her!
- Crying won't help. Why bother?

736
01:09:29,876 --> 01:09:31,501
Are you glaring at me?

737
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,584
- Where are you going?
- You can't go.

738
01:09:33,667 --> 01:09:35,209
What's more important?
Books or yourself?

739
01:09:35,292 --> 01:09:37,917
You want to go to university?
In your dreams.

740
01:09:38,167 --> 01:09:40,334
- A close-up shot.
- Miao, come here.

741
01:09:40,459 --> 01:09:41,876
- Hit her.
- Go on.

742
01:09:45,959 --> 01:09:47,834
- Good one!
- That's more like it!

743
01:09:48,542 --> 01:09:50,042
Good lord.

744
01:09:50,584 --> 01:09:52,251
Come on, go ahead!

745
01:09:53,626 --> 01:09:55,001
Hit her!

746
01:09:56,459 --> 01:09:58,251
A close-up shot!

747
01:09:59,376 --> 01:10:00,542
Cut her hair!

748
01:10:00,626 --> 01:10:02,917
Cut!

749
01:10:03,001 --> 01:10:04,876
- Cut!
- More, keep going!

750
01:10:04,959 --> 01:10:06,792
- More!
- Cut it all off.

751
01:10:10,584 --> 01:10:12,376
So now you're not talking?

752
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,334
- Goodness.
- Why are you crying?

753
01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:16,209
- What's wrong?
- Why are you crying?

754
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:17,209
Quit crying!

755
01:10:17,292 --> 01:10:19,251
Do guys even like you?

756
01:10:19,834 --> 01:10:20,834
Let's see.

757
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:22,834
You're not even pretty.

758
01:10:23,084 --> 01:10:24,834
How did you get guys to help you?

759
01:10:24,917 --> 01:10:26,459
What a pretentious slut.

760
01:10:27,084 --> 01:10:28,626
You must have a great body.

761
01:10:28,709 --> 01:10:29,709
Anybody want to see it?

762
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,584
- Yes!
- Yes!

763
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:34,417
Let's see what you have! Strip her!

764
01:10:34,501 --> 01:10:37,334
- Strip her! Take it all off!
- Strip her!

765
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:45,792
What are you guys doing?

766
01:10:45,876 --> 01:10:47,584
- I've called the cops!
- What a bitch!

767
01:11:03,876 --> 01:11:06,251
We just say the same thing
to the police every time.

768
01:11:06,709 --> 01:11:08,709
That guy must be going to prison.

769
01:11:08,792 --> 01:11:10,084
It's just a bottle.

770
01:12:00,709 --> 01:12:01,834
Let go!

771
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:04,209
Let go!

772
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:05,501
Let go!

773
01:12:05,959 --> 01:12:07,959
- Let go!
- Go and kill them all, then!

774
01:15:22,209 --> 01:15:23,126
Students.

775
01:15:23,709 --> 01:15:27,001

777
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:30,876
Arrive at least 15 minutes early.

778
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:32,042
Do you hear me?

779
01:15:32,126 --> 01:15:33,584
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

780
01:15:34,667 --> 01:15:35,959

WEI LAI

853
01:21:43,709 --> 01:21:45,917
Do you own the vehicle
with the plate AT3258?

854
01:21:57,334 --> 01:21:59,792
Where were you on the night of May 31?

855
01:22:05,126 --> 01:22:06,542
I was at the hospital.

856
01:22:06,959 --> 01:22:08,376
Many people saw me.

857
01:22:08,459 --> 01:22:09,709
You can ask around.

858
01:22:10,667 --> 01:22:13,459
Surveillance cameras caught your car
near the crime scene.

859
01:22:13,917 --> 01:22:16,084
Your car trunk tested
positive for blood.

860
01:22:16,209 --> 01:22:17,292
Can you explain that?

861
01:22:19,459 --> 01:22:20,542
My car...

862
01:22:21,959 --> 01:22:23,417
was stolen.

863
01:22:23,626 --> 01:22:24,584
Stolen?

864
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:28,417
Who would return your car
after murdering someone?

865
01:22:29,042 --> 01:22:30,667
Don't you own a motorbike?

866
01:22:30,959 --> 01:22:34,334
Unless it's someone you know.

867
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:36,584
What do you need my dad's cab for?

868
01:22:36,709 --> 01:22:38,417
His shift starts early tomorrow.

869
01:22:38,501 --> 01:22:40,209
I want to try driving a cab.

870
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:46,334
Yongkang?

871
01:22:46,542 --> 01:22:47,709
What?

872
01:22:47,876 --> 01:22:49,292
We're buddies, right?

873
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:54,126
Just listen to me.

874
01:22:55,084 --> 01:22:56,751
Get a full medical checkup.

875
01:22:57,126 --> 01:22:58,417
Test everything.

876
01:22:59,001 --> 01:23:00,751
Don't return home until you're done.

877
01:23:04,834 --> 01:23:05,876
Hey!

878
01:23:07,709 --> 01:23:08,876
You'll be fine.

879
01:23:09,834 --> 01:23:11,751
Whatever they ask you,
just tell the truth.

880
01:23:41,376 --> 01:23:42,834
Is she really dead?

881
01:23:46,042 --> 01:23:47,417
Why are you smiling?

882
01:23:47,917 --> 01:23:48,917
I'm not.

883
01:23:49,001 --> 01:23:50,751
Wei Lai hasn't called me
since that day.

884
01:23:50,834 --> 01:23:51,959
Which day?

885
01:23:56,001 --> 01:23:57,459
It wasn't my fault.

886
01:23:57,542 --> 01:23:59,459
They were out of control that day.

887
01:23:59,542 --> 01:24:00,876
If I didn't do as they said,

888
01:24:00,959 --> 01:24:02,459
they would have killed me.

889
01:24:03,626 --> 01:24:04,792
Chen Nian killed her.

890
01:24:04,876 --> 01:24:06,292
You're accusing Chen Nian

891
01:24:06,376 --> 01:24:07,917
because you've been bullying her.

892
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,584
Who's the bully here?

893
01:24:10,709 --> 01:24:12,292
Wei Lai feared for her life.

894
01:24:20,001 --> 01:24:21,209
Quit crying!

895
01:24:22,042 --> 01:24:24,042
So now you're not talking?

896
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:26,459
- Give her a haircut.
- Don't like the haircut?

897
01:24:26,542 --> 01:24:27,876
What do you think of the haircut?

898
01:24:28,459 --> 01:24:30,501
You have no right to cry.

899
01:24:30,584 --> 01:24:33,667
- Quit crying!
- Why are you crying?

900
01:24:43,792 --> 01:24:45,209
I saw the video.

901
01:24:47,334 --> 01:24:48,876
Why didn't you call the police?

902
01:24:53,292 --> 01:24:54,917
I had to focus on the entrance exam.

903
01:24:56,209 --> 01:24:57,959
I filed a complaint once before.

904
01:25:01,959 --> 01:25:02,959
Can we

905
01:25:03,251 --> 01:25:05,334
postpone this until after the exam?

906
01:25:06,792 --> 01:25:08,792
I still have two papers tomorrow.

907
01:25:10,126 --> 01:25:11,042
No.

908
01:25:12,001 --> 01:25:13,667
You must come with me.

909
01:25:15,876 --> 01:25:17,001
Chen Nian.

910
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:20,251
Wei Lai is dead.

911
01:25:20,751 --> 01:25:22,126
You're a prime suspect.

912
01:25:47,792 --> 01:25:51,584
Chen Nian, you're being
interviewed as a suspect.

913
01:25:51,876 --> 01:25:54,626
Tell the truth and we will be lenient.

914
01:25:55,042 --> 01:25:56,084
Understand?

915
01:25:59,917 --> 01:26:01,126
Answer me.

916
01:26:01,751 --> 01:26:02,876
I understand.

917
01:26:04,376 --> 01:26:07,376
Did you tell your mom
about the incident?

918
01:26:09,042 --> 01:26:10,292
Has she returned?

919
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:13,084
No.

920
01:26:15,042 --> 01:26:17,042
Did it affect your studies?

921
01:26:17,251 --> 01:26:19,376
They filmed you.
Why didn't you report them?

922
01:26:23,001 --> 01:26:24,084
As I've said,

923
01:26:24,459 --> 01:26:25,917
I wanted to focus on the exam.

924
01:26:26,417 --> 01:26:27,459
Really?

925
01:26:27,751 --> 01:26:29,584
They took pictures of you naked.

926
01:26:29,667 --> 01:26:32,042
You were assaulted,
but didn't call the cops.

927
01:26:32,126 --> 01:26:33,334
How could you stay focused?

928
01:26:40,667 --> 01:26:42,834
When was the last time
you saw Wei Lai?

929
01:26:44,751 --> 01:26:47,667
I haven't seen her
since that incident.

930
01:26:50,209 --> 01:26:52,751
- How did she die?
- Just answer the questions.

931
01:26:52,834 --> 01:26:54,001
Understand?

932
01:26:56,501 --> 01:26:57,417
Yes.

933
01:26:58,501 --> 01:27:01,167
Where were you on
the night of May 31?

934
01:27:06,959 --> 01:27:08,376
Studying at home.

935
01:27:08,792 --> 01:27:10,167
I study at home every day.

936
01:27:10,251 --> 01:27:11,376
Any witnesses?

937
01:27:16,126 --> 01:27:18,542
It's okay.
We can ask your neighbors.

938
01:27:33,292 --> 01:27:34,459
Hey.

939
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:37,709
Are you done?

940
01:27:38,917 --> 01:27:39,834
Well?

941
01:27:40,917 --> 01:27:42,709
She doesn't have an alibi.

942
01:27:43,042 --> 01:27:45,501
We have a motive but no evidence.

943
01:27:46,626 --> 01:27:48,709
Let's release her for now.
She has exams tomorrow.

944
01:27:51,001 --> 01:27:52,209
Wang Li, what do you think?

945
01:27:52,292 --> 01:27:53,751
I think her reactions were unusual.

946
01:27:53,834 --> 01:27:54,917
What's the correct reaction?

947
01:27:55,001 --> 01:27:56,209
Crying and screaming?

948
01:27:56,959 --> 01:27:59,917
Don't allow emotions
to cloud your judgment.

949
01:28:00,001 --> 01:28:02,042
How do you explain Fang Yongkang's car?

950
01:28:02,126 --> 01:28:03,292
Did Chen Nian steal it?

951
01:28:03,376 --> 01:28:05,542
She's so tiny.
How could she move the body?

952
01:28:05,626 --> 01:28:06,667
What's your problem?

953
01:28:06,751 --> 01:28:08,084
She might have an accomplice.

954
01:28:08,167 --> 01:28:10,167
What's wrong with you?
You're being unprofessional.

955
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:11,501
Enough.

956
01:28:11,584 --> 01:28:13,126
Calm down, both of you.

957
01:28:13,667 --> 01:28:15,084
A girl just filed a report.

958
01:28:15,334 --> 01:28:17,001
She was almost raped in a park.

959
01:28:17,084 --> 01:28:18,542
She saw the attacker's face.

960
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:20,376
It fits the serial
rapist's description.

961
01:28:20,459 --> 01:28:22,917
Wang Li, the girl is not in...

962
01:28:28,667 --> 01:28:29,917
Release Chen Nian.

963
01:28:30,001 --> 01:28:31,417
Keep her under surveillance.

Those are cops behind us.

975
01:31:22,334 --> 01:31:24,667
Didn't you say
we can't be seen together?

976
01:31:35,542 --> 01:31:36,501
Scream for help.

There's no time.

978

Scream for help now.

979
01:31:43,626 --> 01:31:45,626
I stalked and harassed you.

980
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,251
I tried to rape Wei Lai,
but accidentally killed her.

981
01:31:48,334 --> 01:31:49,542
No. You didn't.

982
01:31:49,626 --> 01:31:50,501
I left behind evidence.

983
01:31:50,834 --> 01:31:51,959
They're looking for me.

984
01:31:56,501 --> 01:31:57,501
I'll turn myself in!

985
01:32:01,126 --> 01:32:02,084
Chen Nian!

986
01:32:04,376 --> 01:32:05,584
Take a good look.

987
01:32:07,084 --> 01:32:08,251
Don't you see?

988
01:32:09,667 --> 01:32:11,084
I'm a man with nothing.

989
01:32:11,667 --> 01:32:13,667
No brains, no money,

990
01:32:13,876 --> 01:32:15,126
and no future.

991
01:32:17,251 --> 01:32:18,626
But I love someone.

992
01:32:19,876 --> 01:32:21,542
I want her to have a happy ending.

993
01:32:25,209 --> 01:32:26,626
I won't leave you.

994
01:32:30,126 --> 01:32:31,501
I'm a minor.

995
01:32:35,126 --> 01:32:36,501
I won't get a harsh sentence.

996
01:32:39,084 --> 01:32:40,709
Once you graduate from university,

997
01:32:41,751 --> 01:32:43,209
I'll already be out.

998
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:47,501
I'm not going anywhere.

999
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,042
If you succeed,

1000
01:32:52,709 --> 01:32:54,167
I won't be a total loser.

1001
01:33:02,376 --> 01:33:03,542
You go first.

1002
01:33:04,001 --> 01:33:05,917
- Find somewhere safe first.
- No.

1003
01:33:07,501 --> 01:33:08,626
Chen Nian,

1004
01:33:09,626 --> 01:33:11,251
when you're all grown up...

1005
01:33:16,459 --> 01:33:18,251
we'll meet again, right?

1006
01:33:35,542 --> 01:33:36,667
Don't forget.

1007
01:33:38,542 --> 01:33:39,917
You still owe me one.

1008
01:34:16,709 --> 01:34:18,917
Shut up if you want to live!

1009
01:34:36,126 --> 01:34:37,001
Hold him!

1010
01:34:37,084 --> 01:34:38,126
Don't move!

1011
01:35:27,001 --> 01:35:28,334
Shut up if you want to live!

1012
01:35:29,751 --> 01:35:31,709
Help!

1013
01:35:40,584 --> 01:35:42,751
You said you were pretending
to be the rapist

1014
01:35:42,834 --> 01:35:44,709
when you assaulted
Zhang Jing and Chen Nian.

1015
01:35:44,792 --> 01:35:46,167
Check the records.

1016
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:51,084
My buddies and I were brought in

1017
01:35:51,251 --> 01:35:53,042
to stand in the lineup.

1018
01:35:53,209 --> 01:35:54,542
We were later released.

1019
01:35:55,626 --> 01:35:57,251
I'm not the rapist you're looking for.

1020
01:35:58,584 --> 01:36:00,417
I don't understand.

1021
01:36:00,876 --> 01:36:02,334
You're a good-looking kid.

1022
01:36:02,667 --> 01:36:04,584
You could easily get a girlfriend.

1023
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:06,334
Why did you do it?

1024
01:36:07,376 --> 01:36:08,626
Take a guess.

1025
01:36:09,292 --> 01:36:10,667
If you guess right, I'll tell you.

1026
01:36:11,417 --> 01:36:13,167
- If you guess wrong, I won't.
- Shut up!

1027
01:36:13,251 --> 01:36:14,876
I don't have time for bullshit!

1028
01:36:14,959 --> 01:36:16,126
No more questions.

1029
01:36:16,209 --> 01:36:17,667
Just tell me what happened.

1030
01:36:17,751 --> 01:36:19,417
Give me all the details.

1031
01:36:19,501 --> 01:36:21,292
I told him everything already.

1032
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:23,001
There's nothing more.

1033
01:36:23,084 --> 01:36:24,251
I'm telling you.

1034
01:36:24,667 --> 01:36:28,459
- Concrete evidence carries more weight.
- Then go find the evidence.

1035
01:36:29,001 --> 01:36:30,501
I have nothing to add.

1036
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:39,917
If Li Lifang saw you now...

1037
01:36:41,959 --> 01:36:43,417
How would she feel?

1038
01:37:06,376 --> 01:37:09,959
I want to give you a chance
to redeem yourself.

1039
01:37:13,667 --> 01:37:16,792
Our people are tracking down your mom now.

1040
01:37:18,209 --> 01:37:19,334
Do you want to see her?

1041
01:37:22,626 --> 01:37:25,126
Don't you want to know how she is?

1042
01:37:27,959 --> 01:37:31,001
Would you rather confess
or see your mom like this?

1043
01:37:42,584 --> 01:37:43,959
What do you want?

1044
01:37:45,084 --> 01:37:46,084
Get to the point.

1045
01:37:46,834 --> 01:37:48,251
Have you seen this girl before?

1046
01:37:50,917 --> 01:37:53,209
Her name is Wei Lai.
She was killed and buried.

1047
01:37:55,376 --> 01:37:57,667
The lab ran a test and confirmed

1048
01:37:58,292 --> 01:38:00,876
that tissue found under her nails
belongs to you.

1049
01:38:03,417 --> 01:38:05,626
Liu Beishan, why did you
kill Wei Lai?

1050
01:38:17,917 --> 01:38:20,751
DELETE

1051
01:38:32,792 --> 01:38:34,876
She would still be alive
if she did what she was told.

1052
01:38:35,667 --> 01:38:37,417
But she kicked and bit me.

1053
01:38:38,501 --> 01:38:39,959
She hurt me,

1054
01:38:40,834 --> 01:38:42,542
so I pushed her lightly.

1055
01:38:43,834 --> 01:38:45,251
Then she died just like that.

1056
01:39:22,667 --> 01:39:24,126
I already apologized

1057
01:39:24,209 --> 01:39:25,709
to the man who called the cops

1058
01:39:25,792 --> 01:39:27,042
and I also deleted the videos.

1059
01:39:27,126 --> 01:39:28,917
The others all listen to me.

1060
01:39:29,001 --> 01:39:30,167
See?

1061
01:39:33,501 --> 01:39:34,709
What do you want?

1062
01:39:35,834 --> 01:39:37,584
Don't report me to the police.

1063
01:39:40,667 --> 01:39:41,834
How much money do you want?

1064
01:39:41,917 --> 01:39:43,917
I can pay you as much as you want.

1065
01:39:44,126 --> 01:39:45,417
Just tell me.

1066
01:39:47,001 --> 01:39:48,126
Tell me.

1067
01:39:54,542 --> 01:39:57,667
You can film me if you want, Chen Nian.

1068
01:39:59,501 --> 01:40:01,167
Hit me!

1069
01:40:01,251 --> 01:40:03,001
Yell at me! Slap me!

1070
01:40:04,876 --> 01:40:07,042
I can't repeat another grade.

1071
01:40:07,376 --> 01:40:11,376
My dad hasn't talked
to me in a year.

1072
01:40:11,542 --> 01:40:12,834
- Please.
- I don't want to hear it.

1073
01:40:13,917 --> 01:40:15,626
You don't need to forgive me.

1074
01:40:15,709 --> 01:40:17,709
Just don't file a report.

1075
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:19,876
We all went overboard.

1076
01:40:20,626 --> 01:40:23,042
I'm begging you, Chen Nian. I'm so sorry.

1077
01:40:23,334 --> 01:40:25,084
Just name your terms.

1078
01:40:25,334 --> 01:40:27,584
I'll agree to anything.

1079
01:40:27,667 --> 01:40:28,917
I'm begging you.

1080
01:40:29,542 --> 01:40:31,917
I can't repeat another year.

1081
01:40:33,959 --> 01:40:36,084
I don't want to see you ever again.

1082
01:40:38,084 --> 01:40:39,334
Understood.

1083
01:40:50,709 --> 01:40:52,167
Wait!

1084
01:41:03,584 --> 01:41:05,792
If you don't want to see me again,

1085
01:41:05,876 --> 01:41:08,334
let's not apply to the same schools.

1086
01:41:08,417 --> 01:41:09,834
What's your first choice?

1087
01:41:09,917 --> 01:41:11,126
Mine is Peking University.

1088
01:41:11,584 --> 01:41:12,751
What's yours?

1089
01:41:16,501 --> 01:41:18,084
It's okay if you
don't want to tell me.

1090
01:41:18,167 --> 01:41:21,292
Let's hope we both
do well in the exam.

1091
01:41:23,001 --> 01:41:24,084
What a pity.

1092
01:41:24,167 --> 01:41:26,584
We could have been friends.

1093
01:41:26,792 --> 01:41:30,001
Luo Ting is an idiot
and Xu Miao is two-faced.

1094
01:41:30,126 --> 01:41:31,917
But you're decent.

1095
01:41:32,126 --> 01:41:33,376
My mom was right.

1096
01:41:33,459 --> 01:41:34,834
Make friends with good people

1097
01:41:34,917 --> 01:41:36,542
and life will be easier.

1098
01:41:36,626 --> 01:41:37,542
Easier?

1099
01:41:37,626 --> 01:41:38,459
Yes.

1100
01:41:38,542 --> 01:41:40,792
I took care of the video
and you forgave me.

1101
01:41:40,876 --> 01:41:42,417
We can both forget about it,

1102
01:41:42,501 --> 01:41:44,209
like nothing happened.

1103
01:41:44,584 --> 01:41:46,542
It's more important
to live in the present.

1104
01:41:49,626 --> 01:41:51,251
Are you sure you don't want money?

1105
01:41:51,334 --> 01:41:53,376
I would feel better if you took some.

1106
01:41:53,459 --> 01:41:55,417
You can clear your mom's debts.

1107
01:41:55,501 --> 01:41:58,251
Then you two can stop hiding
and live with some dignity.

1108
01:42:19,667 --> 01:42:21,084
I failed.

1109
01:42:36,834 --> 01:42:39,042
You said you never met Liu Beishan.

1110
01:42:40,209 --> 01:42:41,685
Your classmate said he saw

1111
01:42:41,709 --> 01:42:43,542
Beishan stalking
and harassing you.

1112
01:42:43,751 --> 01:42:44,751
Do you recall that?

1113
01:42:47,126 --> 01:42:48,334
I don't remember.

1114
01:42:50,876 --> 01:42:53,667
She puts up a weak act
and men flock to protect her.

1115
01:42:54,334 --> 01:42:56,251
Are all men such pigs?

1116
01:43:06,667 --> 01:43:08,393
Wang Li, I need surveillance footage

1117
01:43:08,417 --> 01:43:10,334
of Chen Nian's daily
commute to school.

1118
01:43:14,126 --> 01:43:15,667
Zoom in on the person in grey.

1119
01:43:16,376 --> 01:43:17,584
More.

1120
01:43:29,042 --> 01:43:30,417
What do you want?

1121
01:43:31,042 --> 01:43:32,417
Study, take the exam,

1122
01:43:33,001 --> 01:43:34,334
and go to a good school.

1123
01:43:34,876 --> 01:43:36,709
Become one of the smart ones

1124
01:43:37,084 --> 01:43:38,459
and find answers.

1125
01:43:39,376 --> 01:43:40,917
If possible,

1126
01:43:41,667 --> 01:43:43,126
protect the world.

1127
01:43:44,626 --> 01:43:45,959
Can you do it?

1128
01:43:47,167 --> 01:43:48,334
I want to try.

1129
01:44:01,042 --> 01:44:02,084
It's a deal.

1130
01:44:03,751 --> 01:44:04,959
You protect the world.

1131
01:44:05,876 --> 01:44:07,126
I'll protect you.

1132
01:44:14,584 --> 01:44:17,251
- Strip her! Take it all off!
- Strip her!

1133
01:44:17,334 --> 01:44:19,209
- Take it all off!
- Let me do it.

1134
01:44:19,292 --> 01:44:20,376
Strip her!

1135
01:44:22,417 --> 01:44:23,459
Strip her!

1136
01:44:23,542 --> 01:44:25,292
Tell me if you can't watch anymore.

1137
01:44:25,376 --> 01:44:27,834
She'll do anything for money.

1138
01:44:27,917 --> 01:44:29,584
What do you mean?

1139
01:44:30,251 --> 01:44:31,459
This is good stuff.

1140
01:44:32,542 --> 01:44:33,917
But the camera is shaky.

1141
01:44:34,501 --> 01:44:35,792
I can't see it clearly.

1142
01:44:38,792 --> 01:44:41,084
Which one is Wei Lai?

1143
01:44:46,876 --> 01:44:49,084
- I can't tell.
- Why did you skip the middle one?

1144
01:44:50,959 --> 01:44:51,876
It's gross.

1145
01:44:51,959 --> 01:44:53,251
They're all gross.

1146
01:44:53,959 --> 01:44:56,001
You know which one is Wei Lai.

1147
01:44:56,417 --> 01:44:58,167
- Strip her!
- Come on!

1148
01:44:59,709 --> 01:45:01,042
I don't.

1149
01:45:02,042 --> 01:45:03,459
Why are you showing me this?

1150
01:45:03,959 --> 01:45:05,501
Maybe you've seen her corpse,

1151
01:45:05,584 --> 01:45:08,501
so you know
what she was wearing when she died.

1152
01:45:08,667 --> 01:45:10,084
You should know.

1153
01:45:10,167 --> 01:45:11,792
- Chen Nian is here.
- What do I care?

1154
01:45:12,501 --> 01:45:13,834
She's next door.

1155
01:45:14,292 --> 01:45:16,417
My colleague is interrogating her.

1156
01:45:18,001 --> 01:45:20,917
Was it my fault that I got bullied?

1157
01:45:22,209 --> 01:45:23,834
I'm sorry about
what you've been through,

1158
01:45:24,834 --> 01:45:26,834
but if you had trusted us adults,

1159
01:45:26,917 --> 01:45:28,251
we could have helped you.

1160
01:45:28,334 --> 01:45:29,792
Who can help me?

1161
01:45:30,667 --> 01:45:32,334
The ones who filmed me?

1162
01:45:32,959 --> 01:45:34,584
Or the onlookers?

1163
01:45:34,667 --> 01:45:37,376
Or the ones who blame me

1164
01:45:37,584 --> 01:45:39,126
for being targeted?

1165
01:45:40,542 --> 01:45:42,792
You took matters into your own hands.

1166
01:45:43,084 --> 01:45:45,292
You confronted Wei Lai and took revenge.

1167
01:45:49,334 --> 01:45:51,959
Revenge may seem normal
to most people.

1168
01:45:52,917 --> 01:45:55,042
But those of us who keep enduring it

1169
01:45:55,334 --> 01:45:57,084
just to get through
the college entrance exam

1170
01:45:57,876 --> 01:45:59,459
are considered wrong?

1171
01:46:02,709 --> 01:46:05,209
If this is how the world works,

1172
01:46:05,542 --> 01:46:07,667
would you want to bring
a child into this world?

1173
01:46:13,042 --> 01:46:14,584
Get me a pack of cigarettes.

1174
01:46:14,667 --> 01:46:15,751
Okay.

1175
01:46:30,251 --> 01:46:31,709
You are Chen Nian's friend.

1176
01:46:32,459 --> 01:46:33,417
So am I.

1177
01:46:33,876 --> 01:46:35,834
You want to help her, so do I.

1178
01:46:36,376 --> 01:46:38,667
But kid, you're too naive.

1179
01:46:39,001 --> 01:46:40,459
You thought you had a perfect plan,

1180
01:46:40,542 --> 01:46:42,209
but we saw through you right away.

1181
01:46:42,292 --> 01:46:44,001
Do you think cops are idiots?

1182
01:46:45,792 --> 01:46:47,126
Even if you keep quiet,

1183
01:46:47,209 --> 01:46:48,917
Chen Nian is still a prime suspect.

1184
01:46:50,084 --> 01:46:51,542
Do you get what I'm saying?

1185
01:46:52,542 --> 01:46:54,001
We're alone now.

1186
01:46:54,876 --> 01:46:55,959
Tell me what happened,

1187
01:46:56,042 --> 01:46:58,334
so I can figure out how to help you two.

1188
01:47:08,292 --> 01:47:09,667
Drop the act.

1189
01:47:11,376 --> 01:47:13,001
Aren't you tired?

1190
01:47:15,334 --> 01:47:17,126
Tell the other guy to come back in.

1191
01:47:27,459 --> 01:47:29,501
Fine, I'll be blunt.

1192
01:47:30,001 --> 01:47:31,292
You and Chen Nian know each other.

1193
01:47:31,376 --> 01:47:34,292
She was bullied and you wanted justice,
so you two killed Wei Lai together.

1194
01:47:35,042 --> 01:47:37,376
You uneducated fool.

1195
01:47:38,251 --> 01:47:39,959
Chen Nian volunteered to come today.

1196
01:47:41,459 --> 01:47:43,376
Do you want to know what she confessed?

1197
01:48:06,501 --> 01:48:07,584
Thanks.

1198
01:48:16,751 --> 01:48:18,334
We don't need your confession.

1199
01:48:18,417 --> 01:48:19,709
Chen Nian broke down.

1200
01:48:19,959 --> 01:48:21,167
Chen Nian,

1201
01:48:21,626 --> 01:48:23,501
what do you know about the world?

1202
01:48:24,167 --> 01:48:26,709
You held out but she couldn't.
She confessed everything.

1203
01:48:27,042 --> 01:48:28,584
What do you know about convicts?

1204
01:48:29,084 --> 01:48:31,709
Do you know
how rapists are treated in prison?

1205
01:48:31,792 --> 01:48:34,167
Everyone will gang up on him.

1206
01:48:35,792 --> 01:48:38,376
Even if you want to sacrifice
yourself for someone else,

1207
01:48:38,917 --> 01:48:40,417
you should first ask yourself

1208
01:48:40,834 --> 01:48:42,251
if she would be able
to live with it.

1209
01:48:43,917 --> 01:48:45,501
Is this what you want?

1210
01:48:46,501 --> 01:48:47,751
You go to heaven

1211
01:48:48,751 --> 01:48:50,251
while someone else rots in hell.

1212
01:48:54,584 --> 01:48:55,751
You accused me

1213
01:48:56,001 --> 01:48:57,751
of letting someone else
take the fall for me

1214
01:48:57,917 --> 01:48:59,584
and leaving him to rot in hell.

1215
01:48:59,792 --> 01:49:00,917
Who did you mean?

1216
01:49:01,626 --> 01:49:04,251
You said that
even if I want to sacrifice myself,

1217
01:49:04,584 --> 01:49:06,126
she wouldn't be able to live with it.

1218
01:49:06,667 --> 01:49:07,959
Who did you mean?

1219
01:49:08,292 --> 01:49:11,626
You said everybody wants to help me.

1220
01:49:12,959 --> 01:49:15,042
But who can actually help me?

1221
01:49:16,084 --> 01:49:18,126
Why do you insist
that I'm helping her?

1222
01:49:19,042 --> 01:49:20,959
What do I get from it?

1223
01:49:21,709 --> 01:49:22,917
I'll say it again.

1224
01:49:23,501 --> 01:49:24,751
Drop the act.

1225
01:49:25,084 --> 01:49:26,917
I'm not making anyone
take the fall for me.

1226
01:49:27,084 --> 01:49:28,959
I, Liu Beishan, am not an idiot.

1227
01:49:29,126 --> 01:49:31,876
Wei Lai's death had
nothing to do with me.

1228
01:49:32,209 --> 01:49:35,251
I only kissed and molested her,
but I don't know her.

1229
01:49:35,501 --> 01:49:37,876
I never met Liu Beishan before.

1230
01:49:51,459 --> 01:49:54,626
Have you considered the severity
of the sentence for such crimes?

1231
01:50:14,167 --> 01:50:15,167
Hey.

1232
01:50:18,542 --> 01:50:19,542
Zheng Yi!

1233
01:50:19,626 --> 01:50:21,459
The suspect cannot meet with the victim!

1234
01:50:21,542 --> 01:50:22,626
Zheng Yi!

1235
01:50:30,792 --> 01:50:33,751
Both of you have been lying
from the beginning!

1236
01:50:35,334 --> 01:50:38,417
Once we submit the report, you won't ever
see her again! Have you ever thought of that?

1237
01:50:43,001 --> 01:50:44,209
I don't know him.

1238
01:50:46,751 --> 01:50:48,709
Why don't we get to
know each other now?

1239
01:50:51,834 --> 01:50:52,959
Chen Nian!

1240
01:50:53,042 --> 01:50:54,459
- Listen to me!
- Calm down!

1241
01:50:55,917 --> 01:50:57,501
Can't you just trust me?

1242
01:50:57,584 --> 01:51:00,334
- Get up!
- Calm down, Zheng Yi!

1243
01:51:00,626 --> 01:51:02,334
Do you really know what you're doing?

1244
01:51:02,959 --> 01:51:04,709
- Zheng Yi!
- Listen to me, Chen Nian!

1245
01:51:04,792 --> 01:51:06,709
- Calm down!
- Just trust me!

1246
01:51:07,126 --> 01:51:08,251
- Zheng Yi!
- Chen Nian!

1247
01:51:51,709 --> 01:51:53,709
You were protective of Chen Nian.

1248
01:51:54,251 --> 01:51:57,251
Why are you now accusing her
of murdering Wei Lai?

1249
01:51:59,709 --> 01:52:02,917
If someone spends decades
in prison for her,

1250
01:52:04,042 --> 01:52:05,751
she won't be able to live with it.

1251
01:52:06,876 --> 01:52:09,084
No one would take the rap
for murder and rape

1252
01:52:09,167 --> 01:52:10,792
just to protect someone.

1253
01:52:10,876 --> 01:52:12,084
We wouldn't.

1254
01:52:12,792 --> 01:52:14,167
But they're still teenagers.

1255
01:53:32,959 --> 01:53:34,209
What's wrong?

1256
01:53:36,542 --> 01:53:38,001
We shouldn't be seen together.

1257
01:53:39,167 --> 01:53:40,209
I don't care.

1258
01:53:41,542 --> 01:53:42,751
It's not that simple.

1259
01:53:44,334 --> 01:53:45,292
Keep walking.

1260
01:53:45,751 --> 01:53:47,167
I'll be right behind you.

1261
01:53:50,126 --> 01:53:51,459
What will you do behind me?

1262
01:53:52,834 --> 01:53:54,042
Nothing.

1263
01:54:07,709 --> 01:54:11,167
HARD WORK SOWED YESTERDAY
WILL BE TODAY'S SUCCESSFUL REAP

1264
01:54:51,834 --> 01:54:54,542
ANQIAO CITY PRISON

1265
01:54:55,751 --> 01:54:57,667
The entrance exam results are out today.

1266
01:54:57,751 --> 01:54:59,417
- What's your score?
- First choice universities'

1267
01:54:59,501 --> 01:55:01,084
entry score is 548.

1268
01:55:01,584 --> 01:55:02,917
- Next is 494.
- It's 632.

1269
01:55:03,001 --> 01:55:04,459
TOTAL SCORE

1270
01:55:04,542 --> 01:55:06,209
How did you score so high?

1271
01:55:07,876 --> 01:55:09,417
I can't believe it!

1272
01:55:10,042 --> 01:55:11,876
All of your efforts pay off now.

1273
01:55:11,959 --> 01:55:13,334
We made it.

1274
01:55:14,292 --> 01:55:16,376
Good people get good karma.

1275
01:55:18,251 --> 01:55:20,126
Nian, I love you.

1276
01:55:21,251 --> 01:55:22,459
I love you!

1277
01:55:24,542 --> 01:55:25,667
Let's eat!

1278
01:55:49,042 --> 01:55:50,959
Keep quiet. I'll go check.

1279
01:55:59,126 --> 01:56:00,834
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

1280
01:56:05,709 --> 01:56:06,876
I was nearby.

1281
01:56:07,334 --> 01:56:09,084
I came by to congratulate you.

1282
01:56:14,501 --> 01:56:15,751
You're free now.

1283
01:56:15,834 --> 01:56:17,126
How do you feel?

1284
01:56:21,834 --> 01:56:23,792
I mean, the feeling of becoming an adult.

1285
01:56:24,459 --> 01:56:25,626
How does it feel?

1286
01:56:27,667 --> 01:56:29,459
Don't want to talk to me anymore?

1287
01:56:30,001 --> 01:56:31,209
I understand.

1288
01:56:31,667 --> 01:56:34,459
You're still mad at me
for suspecting you.

1289
01:56:35,042 --> 01:56:37,459
I was disciplined for
what happened.

1290
01:56:45,042 --> 01:56:46,542
I guess I'll go.

1291
01:56:48,209 --> 01:56:50,042
I'll see you off
when you leave for Beijing.

1292
01:57:00,126 --> 01:57:02,334
By the way,
I have good news for you.

1293
01:57:03,542 --> 01:57:04,917
A few days ago,

1294
01:57:05,251 --> 01:57:07,209
Liu Beishan received
a death sentence.

1295
01:57:12,542 --> 01:57:14,292
Due to the severity of his crimes

1296
01:57:14,376 --> 01:57:16,084
and his previous criminal records,

1297
01:57:16,376 --> 01:57:18,209
the court quickly reached a verdict.

1298
01:57:20,042 --> 01:57:21,501
Isn't he a minor?

1299
01:57:21,876 --> 01:57:23,084
He lied to you.

1300
01:57:23,501 --> 01:57:25,209
Liu Beishan is an adult.

1301
01:57:27,959 --> 01:57:30,667
He would have to bear legal responsibility
even if he were a minor.

1302
01:57:50,834 --> 01:57:52,001
Chen Nian.

1303
01:57:52,876 --> 01:57:54,876
Go away!

1304
01:57:56,251 --> 01:57:57,292
Why?

1305
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:58,959
Why can't you leave us alone?

1306
01:57:59,042 --> 01:58:02,334
Why is it so hard to let us be?

1307
01:58:02,417 --> 01:58:03,959
Just let one of us be free!

1308
01:58:04,042 --> 01:58:05,501
Why did you do that?

1309
01:58:05,876 --> 01:58:07,959
Why did you do that? Why?

1310
01:58:08,917 --> 01:58:10,209
Leave!

1311
01:58:20,209 --> 01:58:21,459
I'm sorry, I lied!

1312
01:58:21,542 --> 01:58:22,584
There's no verdict yet.

1313
01:58:22,667 --> 01:58:24,001
He'll be put away for decades,

1314
01:58:24,084 --> 01:58:25,876
but you could be out in a few years!

1315
01:58:27,167 --> 01:58:28,417
Hate me all you want!

1316
01:58:28,501 --> 01:58:30,167
I just want what's best
for both of you!

1317
01:59:26,001 --> 01:59:28,001
Inmate 178, you have a visitor!

1318
02:02:16,834 --> 02:02:18,376
A good student...

1319
02:02:21,001 --> 02:02:22,626
and a small-time punk.

1320
02:02:24,959 --> 02:02:26,792
Must you drag both of them down?

1321
02:02:30,292 --> 02:02:31,959
You've come a long way.

1322
02:02:51,667 --> 02:02:52,876
Where are you going?

1323
02:02:53,334 --> 02:02:54,709
To sleep. I'm tired.

1324
02:03:16,001 --> 02:03:17,001
Beishan.

1325
02:03:19,376 --> 02:03:21,542
I feel much more relaxed now.

1326
02:03:22,959 --> 02:03:24,209
It's the same feeling I had

1327
02:03:24,501 --> 02:03:26,834
when I finished my last exam.

1328
02:03:29,334 --> 02:03:30,459
Really?

1329
02:03:31,751 --> 02:03:33,792
Did your teacher's
prediction come true?

1330
02:03:36,251 --> 02:03:37,292
Yes.

1331
02:03:38,209 --> 02:03:39,626
What was the composition topic?

1332
02:03:41,167 --> 02:03:43,376
A letter to 20 years
into the future.

1333
02:03:50,542 --> 02:03:51,834
Are you afraid?

1334
02:03:54,001 --> 02:03:55,209
I was.

1335
02:03:55,751 --> 02:03:58,542
Now, just a little bit.

1336
02:03:59,501 --> 02:04:00,667
And you?

1337
02:04:03,292 --> 02:04:04,751
I was a little bit afraid...

1338
02:04:07,126 --> 02:04:08,667
but not anymore.

1339
02:04:15,834 --> 02:04:17,334
If you could go back,

1340
02:04:18,084 --> 02:04:19,834
would you do it all over again?

1341
02:04:28,751 --> 02:04:29,876
Answer me.

1342
02:04:36,334 --> 02:04:37,667
There is no "if".

1343
02:04:39,251 --> 02:04:40,501
Besides...

1344
02:04:43,251 --> 02:04:45,126
I don't wish for such a scenario.

1345
02:05:33,376 --> 02:05:35,251
ANQIAO CITY
NATIONAL COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION

1346
02:05:35,334 --> 02:05:36,209
SECURITY SEAL

1347
02:05:45,501 --> 02:05:46,792
MARKING MUST BE STANDARDIZED

1348
02:05:48,334 --> 02:05:51,042
A LETTER 20 YEARS
INTO THE FUTURE

1349
02:06:23,126 --> 02:06:26,167
JIUPO DISTRICT, FUJIANG DISTRICT

1350
02:07:18,584 --> 02:07:22,417
Does anyone know the difference
between "was" and "used to be"?

1351
02:07:24,126 --> 02:07:25,417
Anyone?

1352
02:07:25,834 --> 02:07:28,042
"Was" means it has passed.

1353
02:07:28,126 --> 02:07:29,959
In fact, both of them mean
that it has passed.

1354
02:07:30,042 --> 02:07:33,001
But the difference is
that "used to be"

1355
02:07:33,084 --> 02:07:35,417
carries a sense of loss.

1356
02:07:36,084 --> 02:07:37,417
Does everybody understand?

1357
02:07:38,042 --> 02:07:39,542
Let's go over the tenses again.

1358
02:08:33,917 --> 02:08:35,042
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1359
02:08:35,251 --> 02:08:37,501
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1360
02:09:56,334 --> 02:09:59,834
Bullying might be happening
all around us.

1361
02:10:00,459 --> 02:10:04,334
Schools are on the frontline

1362
02:10:04,417 --> 02:10:06,209
in preventing bullying.

1363
02:10:06,501 --> 02:10:09,542
However, school bullying
goes beyond campus borders.

1364
02:10:10,042 --> 02:10:13,459
In 2016, the Ministry of Education
and eight other ministries

1365
02:10:13,542 --> 02:10:16,751
implemented 11 initiatives
to control bullying on campus,

1366
02:10:17,167 --> 02:10:21,584
including preventions, penalties,
and long-term deployments.

1367
02:10:23,084 --> 02:10:24,917
In November 2017,

1368
02:10:25,001 --> 02:10:27,459
the Ministry of Education and
ten other ministries initiated

1369
02:10:27,501 --> 02:10:28,810
the Anti-bullying
Intervention Program

1370
02:10:28,834 --> 02:10:30,542
for Primary and
Secondary Schools.

1371
02:10:32,209 --> 02:10:35,876
In 2018, municipal governments
introduced regulations

1372
02:10:36,126 --> 02:10:38,126
to control school bullying

1373
02:10:38,209 --> 02:10:40,959
in accordance
to the State Council's guidance.

1374
02:10:42,376 --> 02:10:47,126
When family, society, the law,
and each one of us

1375
02:10:47,626 --> 02:10:49,518
come together and join forces

1376
02:10:49,542 --> 02:10:51,268
we can protect our
younger generations

1377
02:10:51,292 --> 02:10:52,834
and the world from bullying.
