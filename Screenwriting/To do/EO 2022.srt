1
00:01:31,293 --> 00:01:32,293
Eo!

2
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,589
Eo!

3
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,276
That was the amazing Kasandra!

4
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,630
Ladies, Gentlemen and Children!

5
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,212
Please welcome The Cubeman!

6
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:35,240
Hi.

7
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,027
Giddy-up!

8
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,680
Come on!

9
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,336
Don't you touch him, Vasil!

10
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,240
Don't you dare!

11
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Just try it.

12
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:04,252
<i>Cities like my Wroclaw have banned
circus performances with animals!

13
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:07,174
Bravo, Wroclaw!
Everyone should follow its lead!

14
00:07:07,258 --> 00:07:10,636
Time to end our indifference!

15
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,613
These animals are tortured!

16
00:07:19,013 --> 00:07:22,060
Leave it alone!
Can't you see it's suffering?

17
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:26,920
- Fuck off.
- Can't you see it's suffering?

18
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:31,226
Animals are being tortured!

19
00:07:31,502 --> 00:07:33,400
What the fuck is this?

20
00:07:33,684 --> 00:07:37,056
Bankruptcy and Reorganization
Law. Par. 4, Art. 28...

21
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,307
On the repossession of animals.

22
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,420
That's what.

23
00:08:26,913 --> 00:08:27,913
Eo!

24
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,379
EO!

25
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,075
We continue to work tirelessly,
always guided by the principle...

26
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,826
...of repairing and amending
any irregularities.

27
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:51,928
Now, let's hear
from the chairman of the board.

28
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,609
As the deputy board member just said...

29
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,573
We work tirelessly for the community

30
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:11,953
with the goal of amending
all existing irregularities.

31
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,418
So, for our common good,

32
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:19,216
we now appear before you
to present our latest achievement.

33
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,460
Turn towards me.

34
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,704
Try stroking its muzzle.

35
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,480
Look at the camera.

36
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:45,342
Great. Okay.

37
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,440
Kinga, come have a look.

38
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:49,552
This could be better.

39
00:13:49,644 --> 00:13:51,463
Can you come here?

40
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,017
Touch up her lips a little.

41
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,792
There's a speck of dust right here.

42
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Okay.

43
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,892
Aga, come closer to the horse.

44
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:11,997
A little closer, don't be afraid.

45
00:22:03,372 --> 00:22:04,372
Eo.

46
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,891
Come, Come!

47
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:43,933
Don't do that!

48
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:47,983
Thank you.

49
00:23:48,808 --> 00:23:50,875
- Me!
- You want to read?

50
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:54,081
About the blind old harper?
- Yeah.

51
00:23:54,191 --> 00:23:58,240
"The blind old harper
from the island of Scio

52
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:01,333
walked upon the shores of the Aegan Sea.

53
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:06,084
He mistook the restlessness of waves
crashing upon the thirsty shore

54
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:09,670
for an eager audience

55
00:24:09,754 --> 00:24:13,876
who flocked to hear
his chivalrous songs.

56
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:17,000
And so he leaned on his harp

57
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:21,177
and sang to the sea
from the empty shore."

58
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:27,469
- What's next?
- You'd like to know?

59
00:25:09,431 --> 00:25:10,622
Hey!

60
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,183
Eo!

61
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:50,858
Eo!

62
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:00,531
I have a surprise for you.

63
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:08,983
Happy Birthday Eo!

64
00:27:09,981 --> 00:27:12,678
May all your dreams come true.

65
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:16,269
Be happy.

66
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:18,747
Carrot muffin, remember?

67
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:21,719
Just like last year. You liked it.

68
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,400
Remember this?

69
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,190
Magda!

70
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:40,857
Come with me or stay with the donkey.

71
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,320
You're staying?

72
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:51,952
Stay then.

73
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,614
I have to go.

74
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,042
Zenek, don't scare him.
It's only a donkey..

75
00:39:36,488 --> 00:39:38,393
Wait. Take it easy.

76
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:12,361
Where the hell did you come from?

77
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,805
Some fucker has you tied up!

78
00:40:17,216 --> 00:40:18,292
What if I..

79
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,880
set you free.

80
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,200
Anarchy rules!

81
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,747
<i>Our colors have their way!</i>

82
00:40:38,343 --> 00:40:41,545
<i>Blue and White,
they make our day!</i>

83
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,247
What penalty, referee?

84
00:41:07,918 --> 00:41:11,197
Zenek, you can do it!
You're doing it, Zenek!

85
00:41:11,308 --> 00:41:15,330
- You've got this!
- Come on!

86
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,760
Holy cow, a donkey!

87
00:41:46,979 --> 00:41:48,877
The match is over.

88
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,400
Disperse!

89
00:41:55,956 --> 00:41:57,463
Please disperse.

90
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,600
Walk away, please!

91
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,153
Walk away!

92
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:15,817
It's all because of the donkey!

93
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:17,128
I said, disperse!

94
00:42:21,587 --> 00:42:23,040
A donkey, really?

95
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,336
<i>Our colors have their way!</i>

96
00:42:44,379 --> 00:42:47,245
<i>Blue and White, they make our day!</i>

97
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:03,867
<i>We are the winners,
losing for the wieners!</i>

98
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,244
<i>We are the winners,
losing for the wieners!</i>

99
00:43:07,328 --> 00:43:11,613
<i>Zryw! Zryw!</i>

100
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,857
<i>Our colors have their way!</i>

101
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,440
<i>Blue and white, they make our day!</i>

102
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,930
Zryw!

103
00:43:37,883 --> 00:43:42,962
Zenek, Zenek!

104
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,883
Your beer, come on, take it!

105
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:22,920
Motherfuckers!

106
00:45:25,485 --> 00:45:26,760
Let's go!

107
00:45:39,905 --> 00:45:42,713
ZRYW RULES

108
00:46:10,251 --> 00:46:11,278
The fucking donkey!

109
00:46:11,437 --> 00:46:12,717
Let's fuck it up.

110
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,958
Get the fucker!

111
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Die!

112
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,120
Scram, now!

113
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,718
- Three hooves up in high heaven?
- Sorry?

114
00:48:59,802 --> 00:49:01,382
Why not put it to sleep?

115
00:49:03,532 --> 00:49:05,311
Why should it suffer?

116
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:12,312
We actually heal animals here.

117
00:52:28,297 --> 00:52:30,122
Move, come on!

118
00:52:30,368 --> 00:52:31,368
Go!

119
00:53:54,321 --> 00:53:55,442
Hey, man.

120
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,413
There's one more.
- No, no no.

121
00:53:58,546 --> 00:54:00,011
What do you mean?
- I'm done. No.

122
00:54:00,418 --> 00:54:02,769
I can't. The shipping is signed.

123
00:54:02,871 --> 00:54:03,959
So what?

124
00:54:05,386 --> 00:54:07,223
It's not even a fucking horse.

125
00:54:07,356 --> 00:54:09,169
Of course, it's a fucking horse.

126
00:54:10,439 --> 00:54:11,799
It's salami meat.

127
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:29,393
Damn, I've got crap on my hands.

128
00:58:51,579 --> 00:58:53,165
Come with me.

129
00:58:56,579 --> 00:58:58,979
I have good food. Polish food. Good.

130
00:59:00,785 --> 00:59:02,225
I'm Okay. Come on.

131
00:59:44,277 --> 00:59:45,277
Come!

132
00:59:50,388 --> 00:59:52,787
Very good. Polish bread. Original.

133
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,840
Good, right?

134
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,680
Take this.

135
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,315
Polish forest. Very good.

136
01:00:02,569 --> 01:00:04,249
This is very good, no?

137
01:00:09,632 --> 01:00:10,715
Polish cheese.

138
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:12,843
Polish cheese is very good.

139
01:00:14,315 --> 01:00:15,675
And a Polish pig.

140
01:00:18,259 --> 01:00:19,619
Come on, take it.

141
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,469
You're hungry, aren't you?

142
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:24,871
Hungry

143
01:00:25,141 --> 01:00:26,141
Eat up.

144
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,226
And now sex, huh?

145
01:00:36,267 --> 01:00:37,387
It was a joke!

146
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:40,184
I'm joking...

147
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:45,049
Damn, why do I always
have to screw up everything?

148
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,144
No, No, No!

149
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,960
Hi, buddy!

150
01:03:28,923 --> 01:03:29,923
Hello.

151
01:03:31,145 --> 01:03:32,145
How are you?

152
01:03:35,702 --> 01:03:37,140
What happened here?

153
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:12,834
Want to come home with me?

154
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:14,818
Yes?

155
01:04:17,506 --> 01:04:19,773
I haven't been home for a while...

156
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,893
Think we could travel together?

157
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,120
Hold on.

158
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,532
Let's go, my friend.

159
01:04:38,547 --> 01:04:39,598
Come on.

160
01:04:44,135 --> 01:04:47,199
Did I just save you?
or Have I stolen you?

161
01:04:51,084 --> 01:04:53,168
I hope you are not a criminal.

162
01:04:56,564 --> 01:04:58,707
Just don't expect business-class travel.

163
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,493
I've eaten kilograms of meat.

164
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:26,033
Hundreds of kilograms.

165
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,944
I've also had salami.

166
01:06:38,017 --> 01:06:39,017
Seriously.

167
01:06:39,367 --> 01:06:41,047
Made with donkey meat.

168
01:06:45,014 --> 01:06:46,613
Curious what it tastes like?

169
01:06:48,811 --> 01:06:49,811
Yes?

170
01:06:57,453 --> 01:06:58,453
No?

171
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,350
What? Did I spoil your appetite?

172
01:07:37,008 --> 01:07:40,024
Blessed are you, Lord of the universe,

173
01:07:40,183 --> 01:07:41,983
the provider of this bread,

174
01:07:42,067 --> 01:07:44,017
the fruit of the earth and human labor.

175
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,942
We give it to you

176
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,357
so it may become food
for our eternal life.

177
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,942
Blessed are you, Lord of the universe,

178
01:08:23,026 --> 01:08:24,826
the provider of this bread,

179
01:08:25,262 --> 01:08:27,035
the fruit of the earth and human labor.

180
01:08:33,649 --> 01:08:34,532
Thank you.

181
01:08:34,616 --> 01:08:36,691
Let us pray, brothers and sisters,

182
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:39,548
that our sacrifice may be
accepted by God the Almighty Father.

183
01:08:55,095 --> 01:08:57,095
Whenever he gets into trouble,

184
01:08:57,866 --> 01:08:59,933
you keep calling him my stepson

185
01:09:01,523 --> 01:09:04,757
and not your nephew.

186
01:09:04,959 --> 01:09:06,577
Have you noticed that?

187
01:09:10,353 --> 01:09:12,153
What has he done this time?

188
01:09:17,007 --> 01:09:18,807
What has he done this time?

189
01:11:37,103 --> 01:11:39,160
What did they suspend you for?

190
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,809
Gambling?

191
01:12:00,746 --> 01:12:02,135
You don't want to talk?

192
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,839
Why have you come then?

193
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,320
Not for money, I hope.

194
01:12:08,603 --> 01:12:11,120
Times of supporting your follies
are over.

195
01:12:12,889 --> 01:12:14,329
I sold this place.

196
01:12:16,857 --> 01:12:18,537
I'm going back to France.

197
01:12:18,993 --> 01:12:20,399
Can't help with your debts.

198
01:12:21,857 --> 01:12:24,620
You can take some of
the family heirlooms.

199
01:12:27,174 --> 01:12:29,396
This was your home too.

200
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,095
Before you gambled it all away.

201
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,920
They are quite exquisite.

202
01:12:42,519 --> 01:12:45,005
Your grandma got them
during her London honeymoon.

203
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:47,510
Isn't that so?

204
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:52,243
Cutlery?

205
01:12:54,667 --> 01:12:55,667
Stop.

206
01:12:55,918 --> 01:12:58,476
Please stop!

207
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:05,368
I've never lied.

208
01:13:06,707 --> 01:13:08,853
Not to you, not to your father.

209
01:13:14,406 --> 01:13:15,406
I know.

210
01:13:17,897 --> 01:13:19,419
Why did you run away?

211
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:29,885
What have you done?
