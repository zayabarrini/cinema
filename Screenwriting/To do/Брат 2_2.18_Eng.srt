1
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,618
OK, everybody ready!
Quiet on the set.

2
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,888
- Roll sound.
- Rolling.

3
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,619
- Camera.
- Rolling.

4
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,216
Action!

5
00:00:31,058 --> 00:00:32,776
Action! Action!

6
00:00:33,018 --> 00:00:36,294
- Can l start?
- Get on with it!

7
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:41,088
No, l am not Byron, l am some other

8
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:43,532
Elect who yet remains unknown

9
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:46,251
A pilgrim, though with a Russian soul

10
00:00:46,537 --> 00:00:48,573
Like him l am driven through the world in pother

11
00:00:48,737 --> 00:00:52,252
l set out early, l`ll pass away sooner

12
00:00:52,497 --> 00:00:55,648
My mind will not achieve a lot.

13
00:01:05,376 --> 00:01:08,651
- Where do l get a pass?
- Over there. - Thank you.

14
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:18,011
Sergei BODROV

15
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:23,210
- lt`s OK.
- Which way is it?

16
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:28,445
Take the main elevator to
the eighth floor. You have to ask there.

17
00:01:28,694 --> 00:01:31,491
Thank you.
You`re welcome.

18
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:36,811
Victor SUKHORUKOV

19
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:53,327
Sergei MAKOVETSKY

20
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:03,921
Hello.

21
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,598
Hello.

22
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:12,484
Gary HOUSTON

23
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:28,362
Darya LESNlKOVA

24
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:34,285
Excuse me, where`s Studio 10?

25
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,126
Boris, it`s OK.

26
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:39,240
- Which one?
- Studio 10. Channel 6.

27
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:43,446
Go straight down the corridor
to the elevators.

28
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:46,883
Then go up one floor.
Say hi to Vanya Demidov.

29
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:49,116
From whom?

30
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:55,123
- What`s your name, handsome?
- Danila.

31
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,879
- Who was that?
- Saltykova.

32
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:05,161
- l didn`t catch the name.
- Boris.

33
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:08,203
- Hers.
- lrina.

34
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:12,599
lrina SALTYKOVA

35
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,793
llya has looked for you downstairs
3 times already.

36
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:17,323
Where the hell have you been?

37
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:25,717
Guys, we go live in one minute.
Come on.

38
00:03:25,883 --> 00:03:29,432
Did the soldiers from Chechnya
arrive or not?

39
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:32,158
lt`s OK, Vanya.

40
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:37,831
Kirill PlROGOV

41
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:41,440
Quiet on the set.
30 seconds to go.

42
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:47,632
- Did you host `Music Review` show?
- l used to.

43
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:51,436
So you are Kostya Gromov
and you`ve got several medals of honor.

44
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:55,435
you`re Danila Bagrov,
and that makes you llya Setevoi.

45
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,796
Great. Take the sweater off.

46
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:02,079
Don`t interrupt me. We`re ready.

47
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,151
- Who`s lrina Saltykova?
- What? She`s a pop star!

48
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,438
Good evening. You`re watching
The World of People.

49
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,990
ln 1996, in Chechnya,
Sergeant Kostya Gromov

50
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:25,714
was decorated for bravery,
but he didn`t know about it.

51
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:29,229
Now he has got his medal.
Here is Kostya Gromov

52
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,993
and his comrades-in-arms
Danila Bagrov and llya Setevoi.

53
00:04:34,197 --> 00:04:36,757
Dmitry Gromov,
a famous Russian hockey player

54
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:42,195
now in the NHL
is Kostya`s twin brother.

55
00:04:42,677 --> 00:04:47,272
- What were you honored for?
- lt was a covert operation...

56
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:51,435
Alexander DlACHENKO

57
00:04:51,636 --> 00:04:55,026
When l came round,
l saw the Big Guy...

58
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:57,715
- Who`s the Big Guy?
- lt`s Kostya.

59
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:01,584
So the Big Guy was dragging
the two of us with his left hand.

60
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,833
And he had a machine gun
and a Kalashnikov in his right hand

61
00:05:05,035 --> 00:05:08,993
Blood was streaming out of me,
my hip was busted. l could see

62
00:05:09,714 --> 00:05:14,583
the Kalashnikov bouncing around,
bumping against Danila`s head.

63
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:17,627
l thought he was lucky
to have his helmet on.

64
00:05:17,874 --> 00:05:22,708
Other guys didn`t make it.
Here`s a photograph.

65
00:05:29,753 --> 00:05:31,869
- We`re at a rest point.
- lt`s summer already.

66
00:05:31,993 --> 00:05:33,584
Which one of you is the toughest?

67
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:35,629
Danila.

68
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:42,148
He was very smart
and never feared anything.

69
00:05:43,872 --> 00:05:45,907
Hi. Turn on Channel 6.

70
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:48,666
Check out the boy
with the full lips.

71
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:51,381
l`ll call you back later.

72
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:55,543
Ray TOLER

73
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:58,544
Now l am a security guard
in a bank.

74
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,309
A major one.
lt`s the Nikolaevsky Bank.

75
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,429
l like it there.
The guys are all athletes.

76
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:08,469
l`m actually from Kiev.

77
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:12,827
After school l went to my Dad in Tula
and soon l was recruited

78
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:17,418
And llya here works on
the Red Square.

79
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:22,697
lt`s the former Lenin Museum.
l catalogue their archives.

80
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:26,736
They still have index cards.
l also work as a night guard there.

81
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:29,660
That`s how l bumped into Danila.
l went out one morning

82
00:06:30,748 --> 00:06:33,022
and he was standing there,
looking at the Mausoleum.

83
00:06:33,987 --> 00:06:36,626
What do you want to be?

84
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:40,416
Well, l want to enter
an institute.

85
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:44,057
- Which one?
- A medical school. l want to heal people.

86
00:06:44,226 --> 00:06:46,421
Really? That`s symbolic...

87
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:50,062
Look!

88
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:55,141
Your brother`s in Moscow.
They show him on TV.

89
00:06:56,225 --> 00:06:59,581
And you sit here drinking vodka,
you pig.

90
00:06:59,825 --> 00:07:02,020
You` d better help your mother.

91
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:07,102
l`m going to die soon.

92
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:10,774
You`ll be fine, Ma.

93
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:13,982
You should go to your brother
in Moscow.

94
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:17,454
He`d help you out ,
you fool.

95
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:25,815
He`s your brother, after all.
Screw him...

96
00:07:28,222 --> 00:07:35,651
BROTHER - 2

97
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:42,615
This message is for subscriber 712515.

98
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:49,693
lrina, please call me on
7641232.

99
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:54,538
lt`s Danila. You showed me
the way to Channel 6.

100
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,778
Regards from Demidov.
l`ll be waiting.

101
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,534
- Who`s that?
- Saltykova.

102
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,897
- Where did you get the number?
- From Demidov.

103
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:09,014
Warrant officer, get us
some more cold beer.

104
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:13,217
Mitya was with the Kiev Falcons
for 2 years.

105
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:18,611
Then he was drafted by the NHL to play
for the Chicago Black Hawks. Cool!

106
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:21,895
Can you imagine? Your brother`s
going to America to play hockey!

107
00:08:22,057 --> 00:08:23,696
But the Kiev mob
got him.

108
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:27,054
They egged Chicago Ukrainians
on Mitya.

109
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:30,254
They said: ``We raised you,
we gave you money,

110
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:33,726
now it`s payback time.``
Greedy bastards!

111
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:37,014
Mitya knows if you pay once,
you pay forever.

112
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:43,246
So he found some local
protection... an American.

113
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:48,367
Katya, we are talking, OK?

114
00:08:52,135 --> 00:08:54,694
The American got it right.
He found some people

115
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:58,006
to represent Mitya`s interests
in the NHL.

116
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:01,167
Lots of agents came with contracts
to sign.

117
00:09:01,335 --> 00:09:04,053
Mitya signed them all and
the Ukrainians left him alone.

118
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:09,447
Everything was OK.
He was scoring his goals.

119
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:13,964
Not long ago the Pittsburgh
Penguins bought him.

120
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:16,089
But all the money goes to
the account of this American.

121
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:18,807
And Mitya gets peanuts.

122
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:22,522
Mitya waited and waited until
he realized he`s been conned.

123
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:27,561
He goes back to the Ukrainians
but it`s too late.

124
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,081
This American is sort of
a new Al Capone.

125
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:34,288
He even talks to Mitya through
his lawyer.

126
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:36,726
And Mitya is a star!

127
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:42,005
- How much does he owe Mitya?
- 900 grand, US dollars.

128
00:09:43,371 --> 00:09:46,203
What about filing a lawsuit?

129
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,999
He signed a contract! Mitya didn`t
speak English that time.

130
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,048
He thought the Americans are
honest unlike our lot.

131
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,606
- Guys we want some beer.
- Later.

132
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:04,242
This American has come to Moscow.

133
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:07,407
Mitya called me last night.

134
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:11,083
So what shall we do?

135
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:15,045
l`ll talk to my boss. He`s meeting
the American tomorrow.

136
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:18,956
Can you talk to the
American yourself? You speak English...

137
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:22,238
They wouldn`t let me.
He`s a new Al Capone.

138
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:25,996
What if he never gives it back?

139
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:27,959
l don`t know...

140
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:33,842
l can`t let my brother down!

141
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:38,045
We`re twins, we have always
been together...

142
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:45,520
lt`s been a year since l saw him
and l miss him so much.

143
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:55,197
And who is this Al Capone?

144
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:58,436
Come on. He was the biggest
gangster in America!

145
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:00,993
lt`s for you.

146
00:11:03,724 --> 00:11:05,476
Oh, hi!

147
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:08,797
Girls!

148
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,393
l just wanted to see you.

149
00:11:14,642 --> 00:11:16,997
Demidov gave me your number.

150
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:20,197
No, he`s not here.

151
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:27,752
Kotelnicheskaya?
Yes, l know.

152
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:32,393
See you.

153
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:38,275
- Where`s Kotelnicheskaya?
- You said you knew.

154
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,829
Reveille! Like they say
in the army.

155
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,671
Like they said.

156
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,037
Hey, entrant, time to get
ready for your exams.

157
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:05,316
Can l make a phone call?

158
00:12:15,157 --> 00:12:19,673
The boss has arrived.

159
00:12:21,797 --> 00:12:25,072
Hi, Mr. Belkin, l`m Kostya,
Gromov`s son, from Tula.

160
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:28,114
Yes, l remember. What is it?
Two years ago you helped my brother.

161
00:12:28,237 --> 00:12:30,670
Now he plays hockey in America.

162
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:32,474
You asked your partner
Mr. Mennis from Chicago,

163
00:12:32,596 --> 00:12:35,234
to look after Mitya.

164
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:38,546
But he conned him and took
all his money...

165
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,994
Would you, please talk to him?

166
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:43,824
lf he does not listen to you,
l`ll do it myself.

167
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:48,024
- What will you do?
- l`ll speak to him.

168
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:52,391
- To whom?
- To Mr. Mennis. He`s in Moscow.

169
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:55,834
OK, Kostya, l`ll talk to him.

170
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:20,903
lrina, do you always
watch yourself on TV?

171
00:13:21,272 --> 00:13:24,431
- Dontcha like it?
- Why, it`s okay.

172
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:27,184
But l like bands like Nautilus
or DDT.

173
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:29,188
What are you doing here then?
Get out. l am pressed for time.

174
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,985
Come on, don`t get mad with me.

175
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,827
They don`t listen to this kind
of music there. lt`s fake.

176
00:13:56,428 --> 00:13:59,818
- Where?
- ln the war.

177
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:03,105
What war? There`s no war here.
And the rules are different.

178
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:06,545
This is my kind of music

179
00:14:06,668 --> 00:14:10,182
l really like you. And the music`s got
nothing to do with it.

180
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:16,376
Boris, have you got
a payphone token coin?

181
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,779
Kostya? How did it go?

182
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:50,423
We`ll party in the Metropol.

183
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:54,212
My boss promised to talk to him.

184
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:57,693
Pick me up at 6.
Over and out!

185
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:01,697
How is it going, officer on duty?

186
00:15:03,823 --> 00:15:05,813
You haven`t been with us
for a long time, Valentin.

187
00:15:10,422 --> 00:15:14,097
Progress, Richard.
Fax, e-mail, lnternet.

188
00:15:14,502 --> 00:15:17,777
But you came to Moscow
to appreciate the beauty of our capital.

189
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:24,092
Kate, get us some mint tea
please.

190
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,332
l came, Valentin,
because your offer is very serious.

191
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:45,015
You`re right. A federal law was passed
allowing gambling in lndian reservations.

192
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:51,808
lt`s illegal for foreign companies
to buy land there.

193
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:57,211
That`s why l addressed to you.
l know you talent for evading the law.

194
00:15:57,418 --> 00:16:02,969
- Mr.Belkin, the tea`s ready.
- Bring it, please.

195
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:07,615
We are talking about
large sums of money.

196
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:37,367
Sums l know you don`t have.

197
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:40,168
That`s true.
But l have very serious partners

198
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,644
whose names l can`t tell even you.

199
00:16:43,814 --> 00:16:48,091
The main thing is that everything
will go through me.

200
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:53,853
Now l would like to know
your ideas on technicalities.

201
00:16:57,413 --> 00:17:02,726
He`s busy at the moment,
l`ll tell him. Good bye.

202
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:08,085
lt`s very good.

203
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:21,920
Two years ago l asked you to help
a Russian hockey player in Chicago?

204
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:28,489
He had some difficulties
with the Ukrainian Mafia.

205
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,728
lf you asked, Valentin,
everything is all right.

206
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,644
We are getting involved
in a big operation.

207
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:40,006
You are interested in diamonds
l am interested in the NHL.

208
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:45,203
lt should not concern
our new agreement.

209
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:48,485
We should be looking out
for each other.

210
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:52,886
l`ll pick you up
at the ``Metropol`` hotel at 6.

211
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:59,280
Take Mr.Mennis to the hotel.

212
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:02,644
Get me Chief of security!
Quickly!

213
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,556
Still asleep? lt`s already
5 o`clock!

214
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:22,964
You pick up Kostya,
l`ll come at 7.

215
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:28,401
- OK?
- OK. Over and out.

216
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:32,522
Brake with your legs, not with
your head, shitass.

217
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:14,673
There are too many freaks. They buy
cars and driving licenses

218
00:19:15,441 --> 00:19:19,433
but they can`t actually drive.

219
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,275
Where are you going?

220
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,509
You asshole!

221
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,398
You should be driving a road-roller.
Where do they get their money?

222
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:34,479
They probably buy it as well!

223
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,353
A country of sheep and goats!

224
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,678
You vote for a thin guy, and
in a year you`re watching

225
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,514
some arse-faced hog on TV
who tells you how to live.

226
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:49,791
- Where?
- Turn right behind that building.

227
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:53,595
That`s the Taganka Theater!
Behind that building indeed.

228
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:57,705
There were fewer halfwits
in my generation.

229
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:01,151
Can`t you tell red from green,
you cow?

230
00:20:01,436 --> 00:20:06,669
Green means `go`, red means `stop`!

231
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:09,954
They used to be sensible people

232
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:14,114
and suddenly they all turned
into cretins. Paradox.

233
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:19,190
Sound the horn.

234
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:23,031
That`s not a boat...
That`ll be 66 rubles.

235
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:27,671
- Wait a minute, l`ll get my friend.
- Even women never wait for such morons.

236
00:20:34,314 --> 00:20:38,511
Police.

237
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:32,540
lt`s a murder. 7 Khokhlovsky Lane,
apartment 4.

238
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:37,345
lt`s Konstantin Gromov.

239
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:39,983
Found by Danila Bagrov.
Waiting.

240
00:21:40,268 --> 00:21:44,465
llya, Kostya`s been killed.

241
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:08,341
Don`t call on his cellular phone.
Wait at the museum.

242
00:22:08,505 --> 00:22:11,702
Chief, put
the beds down.

243
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,250
Gimme a cigarette.

244
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:48,853
Hey, blockhead, gimme a light.

245
00:24:01,456 --> 00:24:04,049
You deaf, shithead?
You hear what the guv said?

246
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:10,092
So, you were planning to enter
an institute.

247
00:24:37,053 --> 00:24:39,043
You came to check out
the access courses.

248
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:42,722
And you didn`t know
about the registration? Right?

249
00:24:42,973 --> 00:24:46,408
Can`t you read it?

250
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:48,287
l can hold you for another
three days.

251
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:49,925
Do you really want it?

252
00:24:51,412 --> 00:24:56,360
- Why did you beat them up?
- They asked for it. l want my Discman back.

253
00:24:56,891 --> 00:24:58,404
Nikolaevsky Bank. Founders:
Belkin Valentin Edgarovich.

254
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:03,486
Child: Belkin Fedya.
Studies at Nikolaevsky School.

255
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,760
We need guns.

256
00:26:29,843 --> 00:26:33,278
Hello, Fascist. lt`s llya.

257
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,793
We need trophies of war.

258
00:26:42,362 --> 00:26:43,680
OK.

259
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,270
- Heil Hitler.
- Hi.

260
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,669
- Who`s he?
- One of our own.

261
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:11,718
A brother to your own,
for better or for worse.`

262
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,792
lt`s a popular fascist saying.

263
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,915
- l`m Fascist.
- Danila.

264
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:23,268
- Are you German?
- Russian.

265
00:27:25,358 --> 00:27:29,237
- Actually my Granddad was killed in the war.
- lt happens.

266
00:27:41,796 --> 00:27:45,187
What can l offer you, gentlemen?
Five MPs -

267
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:48,629
four 40s, and a 38.

268
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:52,545
Everything is checked.
With full ammunition.

269
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:57,075
Here are anti-personnel
fragmentation grenades.

270
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:01,672
They sometimes misfire.
lt`s a 50-50 chance.

271
00:28:01,995 --> 00:28:05,032
Panzerfausts with two rounds.
Sorry, not checked.

272
00:28:05,195 --> 00:28:10,746
Here are the handguns: four Walthers,
one Parabellum.

273
00:28:13,954 --> 00:28:18,664
lt`s imported stuff.
As for domestic products

274
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:22,792
there`s a Degtyarev machine-gun.
lt was hardly ever used.

275
00:28:23,673 --> 00:28:27,712
Four PPS`s - they`re heavy,
but reliable.

276
00:28:29,273 --> 00:28:31,581
There`s one Tula Tokarev or TT.

277
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:33,862
They get snapped up
very quickly.

278
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:36,904
There`s one Nagan
but it`s not very reliable.

279
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:41,071
The firing pin`s worn down.

280
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:44,384
l don`t suppose you`d be
interested in Mosin rifles.

281
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:50,586
Where does all this come from?

282
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,823
lt`s the echo of the war.

283
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:09,068
- Where are we going?
- To Moscow.

284
00:30:09,864 --> 00:30:13,300
Hey, Dan, he`s still there.

285
00:30:23,503 --> 00:30:24,902
Brother.

286
00:30:28,902 --> 00:30:31,575
...then l went to the Nikolaevsky Bank

287
00:30:32,662 --> 00:30:36,575
and asked for Kostya Gromov.
Mum gave me the address.

288
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:40,698
Some jerk of a guard said:
``No one of this name works here``.

289
00:30:41,181 --> 00:30:46,301
So, l thought if there`s nobody
at the museum...

290
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:50,934
l`ve got no money and the cops check
my passport on every corner.

291
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,090
Lucky l`ve got my police
pants on.

292
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,532
Wow! ls it real?

293
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:07,695
lt belonged to Chapayev.

294
00:31:08,939 --> 00:31:12,453
- Those were the days!
- Will you go to America with me?

295
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:14,575
Anywhere you say.

296
00:31:14,898 --> 00:31:16,889
We need passports and visas,

297
00:31:17,778 --> 00:31:20,338
and a good car for a few hours.

298
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:24,373
Brother, will you help me?

299
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:46,529
Give me a light.

300
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,364
You ever get any sleep?

301
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,641
My boss is always on the move
doing things.

302
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,687
He`s got a cool car.
ls it German?

303
00:32:58,489 --> 00:33:01,765
- Whom do you want to see?
- Fedya Belkin.

304
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:05,525
- He`s already arrived.
- l`m his brother. l`m late.

305
00:33:05,648 --> 00:33:08,640
That`s OK, they haven`t started yet.

306
00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:14,004
- You can leave it here.
- l`ve got a present there.

307
00:33:38,646 --> 00:33:44,083
This concert is dedicated to
the Students` Day.

308
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:47,284
Meet Fedya Belkin.

309
00:33:47,445 --> 00:33:51,723
He will recite the Student`s
poem!

310
00:34:03,044 --> 00:34:07,161
l discovered that l`ve got
Relatives, and they`re my lot.

311
00:34:07,323 --> 00:34:12,191
They are woods that are so dear
Fields of corn and every ear,

312
00:34:12,403 --> 00:34:17,840
Streams of water, skies of blue.
l shall tell them: ``l love you``.

313
00:34:18,242 --> 00:34:22,554
lt`s the Homeland of mine
l shall love it all the time!

314
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:39,790
Hi, Fedya!

315
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:43,272
The poem... You recited it
very well...

316
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,954
l`m your new Russian teacher,
Danila Sergeyevich...

317
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:58,237
Valentin Edgarovich.
l`m Fedya`s Russian teacher.

318
00:34:59,318 --> 00:35:03,278
l need to talk to you.
Let`s go into the teachers` room.

319
00:35:03,558 --> 00:35:05,514
You go to the conference hall.

320
00:35:08,998 --> 00:35:13,468
- Who`s he?
- Our new Russian teacher.

321
00:35:15,038 --> 00:35:20,157
Goodbye, America,

322
00:35:20,477 --> 00:35:24,469
Where l have never been,

323
00:35:24,837 --> 00:35:30,752
Farewell forever...

324
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:34,705
Keep your hands on the table.
That`s good..

325
00:35:34,995 --> 00:35:39,386
l pull on the trigger,
your balls fall down.

326
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:44,791
Frightened? Were you frightened
when you killed Kostya?

327
00:35:46,874 --> 00:35:48,274
Kostya?

328
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:50,067
Yes, Gromov.

329
00:35:50,994 --> 00:35:54,270
lt wasn`t me. lt was
the American.

330
00:35:54,593 --> 00:35:59,223
lt was him. l couldn`t.
l know his father.

331
00:35:59,514 --> 00:36:04,303
l promised Kostya. l didn`t think
he`d refuse. He`s greedy.

332
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:07,822
Tell me everything about
the American. Now!

333
00:36:08,192 --> 00:36:11,628
Sorry, l`m talking
with a sponsor.

334
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:14,420
A few more minutes

335
00:36:19,032 --> 00:36:21,704
Still talking?

336
00:36:24,911 --> 00:36:26,867
He`s a big shot in lllinois.

337
00:36:27,071 --> 00:36:29,949
He financed the mayor`s
election campaign.

338
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:34,628
He`s got congressmen in his pocket.
He deals in drugs,

339
00:36:34,871 --> 00:36:38,067
owns a string of blues and
rock clubs in Chicago.

340
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,868
He launders his money
in them.

341
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,859
His headquarters are
in the Metro club.

342
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,625
He deals in land and
real estate.

343
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:51,700
He does any business promising
money, like NHL...

344
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:55,619
He orders films in Russia
with real rapes and murders

345
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:57,541
and sells them over there.
He`s very greedy.

346
00:36:57,668 --> 00:37:02,025
He`ll kill you for 100 bucks.
And he conned Kostya`s brother.

347
00:37:04,228 --> 00:37:07,265
l...l didn`t do it.

348
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:12,815
A million is no big deal for him.
He`s got ...

349
00:37:15,587 --> 00:37:19,375
Don`t shoot. You`re
a reasonable man.

350
00:37:21,746 --> 00:37:24,943
All right, live on, scum.
Thank your son.

351
00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:28,416
lt`d be a shame to leave such
a nice kid without a father.

352
00:37:28,905 --> 00:37:31,465
Sit quiet and let
your pants dry out.

353
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:46,582
Don`t bother him. He`s writing
an application for the school board.

354
00:37:51,504 --> 00:37:54,097
You should see a doctor.
Prostatitis is a mean thing.

355
00:37:54,224 --> 00:37:57,260
You won`t get a hard on
and that`s all.

356
00:38:10,342 --> 00:38:13,414
Give me a break!

357
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:21,298
Why did you kill him, you oaf?!

358
00:38:21,461 --> 00:38:23,133
You told me yourself:

359
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:27,653
he doesn`t mind his own business
and you don`t want to see him around.

360
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,773
Shitass!

361
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,251
And llya, he works on
the Red Square.

362
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,409
lt`s the former Lenin Museum.
l catalogue their archives.

363
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:45,492
l also work as a night guard there.

364
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:49,811
- That`s how l bumped into Danila.
- To the museum, fast!

365
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,487
Got to get a new car.
There`s too much heat.

366
00:38:55,658 --> 00:38:59,970
- l changed the plates.
- That thug at the school memorized them.

367
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:03,734
- l`ll change them again.
- When will passports be ready?

368
00:39:03,897 --> 00:39:07,253
Tomorrow or the day after.
lt`s not easy.

369
00:39:10,176 --> 00:39:13,294
Yes... He`s dead.

370
00:39:17,296 --> 00:39:20,686
Here`s the money. Nothing more left.

371
00:39:21,576 --> 00:39:25,489
As soon as you get the passports
buy two tickets to Chicago.

372
00:39:25,935 --> 00:39:27,812
We need to scram.

373
00:39:28,095 --> 00:39:30,529
Sooner or later they`ll check out
the museum. And the apartments.

374
00:39:31,055 --> 00:39:34,172
- They won`t find yours.
- The cops have got my address.

375
00:39:36,055 --> 00:39:37,249
Let`s go.

376
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:48,809
Let`s take this one too.
lt`s a beauty.

377
00:39:57,293 --> 00:40:00,284
This message is for subscriber 712515.

378
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:05,846
lrina, call me immediately.
Danila.

379
00:40:13,531 --> 00:40:16,250
l told you there`s too much heat.

380
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:19,726
Sit quiet, it`s OK.

381
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:28,281
Your driving license
and car papers.

382
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,202
Hello.

383
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:37,238
She can`t speak right now.
They are shooting a new video.

384
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:42,884
- ls it a decade pass?
- Hang on...

385
00:40:49,608 --> 00:40:51,803
Yes, it is. l`ll come over.

386
00:40:51,928 --> 00:40:54,761
Where is it?

387
00:40:57,647 --> 00:41:00,002
We`re going to the TV center.

388
00:41:01,327 --> 00:41:04,125
- Have a safe trip.
- Goodbye.

389
00:41:04,887 --> 00:41:06,922
Wow!

390
00:41:09,087 --> 00:41:12,920
Relax. My papers... are
in order.

391
00:41:17,286 --> 00:41:21,278
Don`t worry, pops.
We`re friends of llya`s.

392
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:26,201
We`ll just take a look at
the exhibition.

393
00:41:33,164 --> 00:41:35,632
They left an hour ago.

394
00:41:35,964 --> 00:41:39,957
Three of them. They took
some kind of a box.

395
00:41:42,523 --> 00:41:45,959
The old guy doesn`t remember
a fucking thing.

396
00:41:47,283 --> 00:41:51,242
Lay an ambush. Start looking for
a white Volvo.

397
00:41:51,523 --> 00:41:54,799
Call the traffic police.
They could change registration plates.

398
00:41:54,923 --> 00:42:00,076
Check out the airlines:
The name is Bagrov, flying to Chicago.

399
00:42:01,162 --> 00:42:03,437
Guys from Aeroflot will tell me, of course,

400
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:06,837
but other airlines never give out such info.

401
00:42:06,962 --> 00:42:10,556
Get a Duma deputy`s card
or a security service lD.

402
00:42:10,721 --> 00:42:12,916
Do l have to spell it out
for you?

403
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:38,268
Okay.

404
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:40,273
Cut.

405
00:42:40,398 --> 00:42:43,151
That was no good. 25 frames
& the whole track.

406
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,708
Once again!

407
00:42:53,477 --> 00:42:56,787
- How long`s it been going on?
- For the third day, already.

408
00:42:58,077 --> 00:43:01,911
- lt`s a hard job...
- But not the worst one.

409
00:43:04,356 --> 00:43:07,587
- Where did you serve?
- ln the paratroopers.

410
00:43:09,636 --> 00:43:13,948
- Did you see any action?
- l had a crack at the Afghans.

411
00:43:17,716 --> 00:43:21,867
Listen, is there... anything
going on between you and lrina?

412
00:43:25,994 --> 00:43:28,462
lt`s just... well,
l really like her.

413
00:43:31,914 --> 00:43:33,950
But she sings all that crap.

414
00:43:36,034 --> 00:43:38,263
lt`s no Nautilus or DDT.

415
00:43:38,393 --> 00:43:40,463
Maybe you should become
a music producer?

416
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:44,630
Maybe l will. But l`ve got
no ear for it.

417
00:43:48,313 --> 00:43:51,827
Another four hours.
l thought we`d finish sooner,

418
00:43:51,992 --> 00:43:56,463
Can l wait for you at home?
Boris, give him the key... or a lift.

419
00:43:56,632 --> 00:43:59,305
lt`s OK, l`ve got a car.
Shall l buy anything?

420
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:11,261
l`ll call you when l wake up.

421
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:35,578
Hey, buddy, was that
lrina Saltykova?

422
00:44:36,828 --> 00:44:38,546
Does she live here?

423
00:44:39,268 --> 00:44:42,943
Listen, buddy, whose banger
is it?

424
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:46,377
No idea. l am a stranger here.

425
00:44:49,427 --> 00:44:51,383
Have you seen this guy
around here?

426
00:44:54,827 --> 00:44:56,101
Nope.

427
00:44:57,746 --> 00:45:00,897
Saltykova`s cool.
You screwing her?

428
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:18,104
There are some guys hanging out
at the Volvo.

429
00:45:18,865 --> 00:45:22,573
- Serious guys. They`ve got your photo.
- Cops?

430
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:25,094
- Don`t look like them.
- How many?

431
00:45:25,504 --> 00:45:28,302
Two by the car.
Some more in the jeep.

432
00:45:28,864 --> 00:45:32,219
l can`t see. The windows are tainted.
One by the doorway.

433
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:36,578
- Thanks, Boris.
- Keep lrina out of it.

434
00:45:53,622 --> 00:45:55,055
Tired?

435
00:45:57,901 --> 00:46:01,052
l`m not alone. My brother
Victor`s here.

436
00:46:01,421 --> 00:46:03,252
He was like a father to me.

437
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:06,293
- Victor Bagrov.
- lrina.

438
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:07,849
Pleased to meet you.

439
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,252
l don`t like Kirkorov,

440
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:16,693
He`s too sweet. All that
make-up. Powdered, like a woman.

441
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,572
What would you say? A Romanian.

442
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:24,016
- But he`s Bulgarian.
- ls he? Any difference?

443
00:46:29,859 --> 00:46:32,213
Where are you, llya?

444
00:46:32,578 --> 00:46:35,138
The address is 2 Sadovaya
Triumphalnaya.

445
00:46:35,698 --> 00:46:38,531
The passports are ready.
The flight`s tomorrow morning.

446
00:46:43,778 --> 00:46:45,972
Move! There`s a jeep downstairs
and four fighters.

447
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:49,056
You`ll run to the car
and open a door for me.

448
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,528
- Ready?
- Yeah.

449
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:12,209
What are you doing here?
Hit the ground!

450
00:47:15,135 --> 00:47:16,806
My regards to Belkin.

451
00:47:22,894 --> 00:47:24,885
That`s the first misfire.
Where are we going?

452
00:47:25,414 --> 00:47:26,767
l`ll drive.

453
00:47:29,893 --> 00:47:35,650
2 men. A tommy-gun and grenades.
Shiryay`s been hit. The plate number of Volvo is...

454
00:47:36,413 --> 00:47:38,323
Get Semyon on the case.

455
00:47:43,772 --> 00:47:45,490
Don`t let them slip away!

456
00:47:47,852 --> 00:47:51,810
He came to the school with this Bald one.
Sava identified him.

457
00:47:52,612 --> 00:47:57,605
He`s clean with the cops.
We`re checking his Mafia links.

458
00:47:58,651 --> 00:48:05,250
A ticket for an Aeroflot flight to Chicago
was booked and purchased.

459
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:09,204
The name is Bagrov. Departs on the 22nd.

460
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:13,687
What date is it today?

461
00:48:16,009 --> 00:48:17,727
ldiot!

462
00:48:21,249 --> 00:48:25,083
Yes, Belkin speaking.

465
00:48:30,488 --> 00:48:33,366
Your partner will receive it
in time.

466
00:48:34,168 --> 00:48:35,999
Good, Konstantin Alexeyevich.

467
00:48:36,807 --> 00:48:39,560
ls everything OK?
Yes, thank you.

468
00:48:40,807 --> 00:48:42,559
We hear you`re having
problems...

469
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:46,557
l solve my problems myself.

470
00:48:49,246 --> 00:48:51,760
- Goodbye.
- All the best.

471
00:49:48,441 --> 00:49:50,193
We can`t lose them, brother.

472
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:52,918
We`ll make it.

473
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,067
Dan, turn off to some quiet place
and brake when l tell you.

474
00:51:33,272 --> 00:51:34,671
Fascist wasn`t kidding.

475
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:02,578
That`s for you.

476
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:08,185
Flight to Chicago departs at 9:10 a. m.

477
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:11,624
You fly to New York
two hours later.

478
00:52:11,788 --> 00:52:14,621
Don`t argue. lt`ll be better
that way.

479
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:17,348
You buy a car for $500
on Brighton Beach

480
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,823
and in 12 hours you`re
in Chicago.

481
00:52:20,628 --> 00:52:24,098
You return four days later.

482
00:52:24,948 --> 00:52:26,539
Why so quick?

483
00:52:28,267 --> 00:52:30,019
You meet here.

484
00:52:32,227 --> 00:52:37,665
That`s Lake Michigan,
the fourth bridge.

485
00:52:43,826 --> 00:52:46,499
There`s a bench there.

486
00:52:46,906 --> 00:52:51,582
l hooked up Kostya`s cellular phone
to the roaming system.

487
00:52:52,745 --> 00:52:55,942
Take this. Use it
if you have to.

488
00:52:56,425 --> 00:53:00,054
Some 250-300 dollars
are left on it. The pin-code is 3232.

489
00:53:03,384 --> 00:53:07,343
Victor Bagrov, you`re going to
the conference

490
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:09,853
on new computer technologies
and software protection.

491
00:53:09,984 --> 00:53:12,781
Danila Bagrov, l don`t know
the purpose of your visit yet.

492
00:53:12,903 --> 00:53:15,463
l`ll have to roam around lnternet
a couple more hours.

493
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,172
ls it the real thing?

494
00:53:23,382 --> 00:53:24,816
Well...almost.

495
00:53:26,742 --> 00:53:29,051
While passing passport control

496
00:53:29,182 --> 00:53:31,821
look confident and smile.

497
00:53:32,222 --> 00:53:34,781
They like it. That`s about all.

498
00:53:38,622 --> 00:53:42,899
- Well, see you there, brother.
- Freedom to Angela Davis!

499
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:08,768
lt`s been a long time since
l kissed in an entrance hall.

500
00:54:23,137 --> 00:54:24,775
- Have you ever been to America?
- Yes.

501
00:54:25,017 --> 00:54:26,848
- What`s it like?
- Nothing special.

502
00:54:28,177 --> 00:54:29,895
l`ve never been abroad.

503
00:54:30,257 --> 00:54:33,407
You haven`t missed much.
Why did you bring me here?

504
00:54:36,296 --> 00:54:38,605
- lt`s beautiful.
- Let`s go to my place.

505
00:54:39,816 --> 00:54:42,694
My train leaves in an hour.
Call me, OK?

506
00:54:44,376 --> 00:54:47,685
- Are you going to America?
- Of course not. To Tula.

507
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:50,332
You can dial without long-distance codes.
Just like in Moscow.

508
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:52,605
lt`s a special phone.
With roaming.

509
00:54:53,015 --> 00:54:54,845
l know.

510
00:54:56,854 --> 00:54:58,731
Okay.

511
00:55:12,293 --> 00:55:15,649
l won`t be long. Four days only.

512
00:55:16,253 --> 00:55:18,084
He`s dead. Let`s go inside.

513
00:57:12,363 --> 00:57:13,636
- Who`s dead?
- My friend.

514
00:57:15,842 --> 00:57:17,560
He wasn`t there!

515
00:57:20,002 --> 00:57:21,799
He couldn`t have slipped
through!

516
00:57:25,721 --> 00:57:30,272
Boss, we checked everything.

517
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:34,112
- Has Bagrov checked in?
- Yes.

518
00:57:35,001 --> 00:57:37,196
- Did all passengers board the plane?
- Yes.

519
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,158
What are you taking me for?
Who is flying to Chicago?

520
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,274
Could l have another glass
ofjuice?

521
00:58:12,757 --> 00:58:18,593
Right, guys, this is
Danila Bagrov.

522
00:58:18,717 --> 00:58:22,231
We have to meet him at the airport
& get rid of him. Nice and quiet.

523
00:58:22,356 --> 00:58:25,871
Some good people asked us to help
the Muscovites out.

524
00:58:30,316 --> 00:58:33,193
Now we shall fill in entrance forms.

525
00:58:33,515 --> 00:58:36,552
All the necessary information

526
00:58:36,835 --> 00:58:39,030
can be found in your entry visa.

527
00:58:44,314 --> 00:58:47,511
- What is the purpose of your visit
to the United States? - What?

528
00:58:48,354 --> 00:58:51,869
- Do you speak English?
- No...l don`t understand.

529
00:58:54,514 --> 00:58:56,153
He`s Russian.

530
00:58:56,153 --> 00:58:57,871
What is the purpose of
your visit to the USA?

531
00:58:58,193 --> 00:59:01,629
lt`s a...conference on new
computer technologies

532
00:59:01,753 --> 00:59:04,062
and software protection.

533
00:59:04,993 --> 00:59:06,745
How long will you stay
in the USA?

534
00:59:06,873 --> 00:59:10,148
Four days. lt`s written there.

535
00:59:10,272 --> 00:59:12,502
Here`s the return ticket.

536
00:59:12,792 --> 00:59:14,669
- Where will you be staying?
- ln a hotel.

537
00:59:14,952 --> 00:59:18,103
lt`s written in the invitation.

538
00:59:18,792 --> 00:59:22,067
- Welcome to the United States.
- Thank you very much.

539
00:59:23,111 --> 00:59:24,669
Morons...

540
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:37,301
- Have you got lard or apples?
- Why?

541
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:42,940
Do you have any food?
Apples? Pork lard?

542
00:59:43,709 --> 00:59:45,427
Don`t they sell it here?

543
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:48,379
You don`t understand.
This is quarantine!

544
00:59:50,428 --> 00:59:51,622
You feeling bad?

545
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:13,099
- Hey, how do l get downtown?
- By taxi.

546
01:00:14,826 --> 01:00:16,977
Hey, fellow countryman, where
do the Russians live here?

547
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:18,780
Russians aren`t my countrymen.

548
01:00:21,746 --> 01:00:23,657
- You a Nazi collaborator?
- What?!

549
01:00:23,946 --> 01:00:25,584
Okay, guys, see you around!

550
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:34,855
Mister Mennis, it`s Moscow on line 1 .

551
01:00:36,105 --> 01:00:38,095
Valentin, how are things?

552
01:00:38,545 --> 01:00:41,183
l`d like to congratulate you.
Your partners are serious people.

553
01:00:41,705 --> 01:00:44,935
l received the first installment of money.
Everything goes according to our plan.

554
01:00:45,344 --> 01:00:47,544
Tomorrow l`ll meet with some people.

555
01:00:47,544 --> 01:00:50,262
And we`ll discuss all the technicalities.

556
01:00:50,543 --> 01:00:55,094
Everything OK with you?
Yes, everything`s fine with me.

557
01:00:57,823 --> 01:00:59,336
But you have got problems.

558
01:01:03,382 --> 01:01:06,294
The Ukrainians say
he wasn`t on the plane.

559
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:10,058
Just like l told you.
We checked the Bald one with the mob.

560
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:16,052
His nick is Tartar.
He`s a hit man.

561
01:01:17,101 --> 01:01:18,819
Worked in St.Pete.

562
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:22,373
Last year he bumped off some kingpins

563
01:01:22,861 --> 01:01:24,259
and disappeared.

564
01:01:25,341 --> 01:01:28,571
He was on that plane.

565
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:40,648
So they`ve hired a hit man
and Bagrov stayed here.

566
01:01:44,819 --> 01:01:48,448
Reinforce my bodyguards! Keep looking
for Bagrov and that museum guy.

567
01:01:49,298 --> 01:01:51,732
Check who he was staying with
in that building

568
01:01:52,178 --> 01:01:56,137
where we found the Volvo
and post a watch there.

569
01:01:57,578 --> 01:02:01,127
Send the Ukrainians a picture
of this Bald one, eh... Tartar.

570
01:02:01,457 --> 01:02:03,448
They`ve got to find him.

571
01:02:05,217 --> 01:02:08,050
What`s the purpose for your visit
to the USA?

572
01:02:08,217 --> 01:02:09,889
New York Film Festival

573
01:02:17,136 --> 01:02:19,366
- Where?
- To Brighton Beach.

574
01:02:19,815 --> 01:02:21,454
- How much?
- 45.

575
01:02:21,856 --> 01:02:24,164
- 45 of what?
- Bucks.

576
01:02:24,855 --> 01:02:26,925
- Can you cut the price?
- l can`t.

577
01:02:30,215 --> 01:02:31,364
This one.

578
01:02:39,054 --> 01:02:40,282
Hello.

579
01:02:42,494 --> 01:02:44,802
- Brighton Beach.
- Stop yelling!

580
01:02:45,534 --> 01:02:47,683
Oh, l thought you didn`t
speak Russian.

581
01:02:48,733 --> 01:02:52,885
Think less, use your brains.
You`re not in Russia anymore.

582
01:02:54,533 --> 01:02:58,889
Those jerks are dying
to have a look!

583
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:02,650
- What was it?
- One more jerk.

584
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:05,801
- Meaning me?
- Who else?

585
01:03:07,292 --> 01:03:10,762
- Why the hell did you come here?
- To see how people live.

586
01:03:12,251 --> 01:03:15,209
l know your type. l`ve been
driving for a long time.

587
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:21,401
First you live with your friends,
then you rent an apartment,

588
01:03:22,611 --> 01:03:25,488
and wait where the bent-up
American dream would take you.

589
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:28,885
You`re wrong. l love
my Homeland.

590
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:34,407
A patriot! The Russian ldea!
Dostoyevsky! The Homeland!

591
01:03:35,489 --> 01:03:38,003
Where`s your homeland, son?

592
01:03:39,169 --> 01:03:43,719
Gorbachov sold it out to
the Americans to have some party.

593
01:03:44,328 --> 01:03:47,161
Your homeland screwed up
two wars and the Crimea.

594
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:52,846
Sold out Russians in the Baltics
and the Serbs.

595
01:03:53,968 --> 01:03:57,084
Your homeland is wherever
your backside is warm!

596
01:03:57,207 --> 01:04:01,200
You know it. That`s why
you are here.

597
01:04:02,487 --> 01:04:04,556
Have you got a brother
in Moscow?

598
01:04:13,086 --> 01:04:15,964
What are you gaping at, dopey?
Get a move on.

599
01:05:12,921 --> 01:05:14,353
Meet my friend.

600
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,236
- Danila.
- Kuibyshev.

601
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,630
Oh, Moscow, Moscow...Russia.

602
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:25,832
Come along then, young fellows.

603
01:05:41,038 --> 01:05:44,826
Don`t pay attention
to the exterior.

604
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:49,113
lt`s got an engine
that goes like my Sonya!

605
01:05:50,078 --> 01:05:53,194
- lt could take you to Kiev.
- Will it make it to Chicago?

606
01:05:53,557 --> 01:05:56,708
Even to San Francisco and back!

607
01:05:57,557 --> 01:06:01,947
We Russians don`t rip off
one another.

608
01:06:58,912 --> 01:07:00,265
Hi, where are you?

609
01:07:01,111 --> 01:07:05,184
l`ve got stuck near Tula.
My car`s broken down!

610
01:07:06,831 --> 01:07:10,870
- How are you doing?
- Fine. Can you drop in today?

611
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:13,339
No, not today. Call again!

612
01:07:27,749 --> 01:07:32,027
A new Russian. The name is Tartar.

613
01:07:32,188 --> 01:07:34,066
What an ugly mug! They`ve got
all kinds of people in Moscow.

614
01:07:34,228 --> 01:07:37,300
l saw him at the airport.

615
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,623
The dog called me a Nazi collaborator.

616
01:07:39,748 --> 01:07:44,343
Post a round-the-clock
watch at the Metropol

617
01:07:44,667 --> 01:07:47,181
where the Russians hang out.

01:34:19,209 --> 01:34:21,404
Hi.

778
01:34:22,889 --> 01:34:24,924
Yes, in Moscow.

779
01:34:25,648 --> 01:34:27,878
Now? l`m in Biriulevo.

780
01:34:29,288 --> 01:34:31,802
l`ll finish the business
in a couple of days.

781
01:34:33,368 --> 01:34:35,244
Call me, OK?

782
01:34:36,847 --> 01:34:38,599
Remember that night on the roof?

783
01:34:50,046 --> 01:34:51,957
He`s in Biriulevo.
Who do we have there?

784
01:34:52,326 --> 01:34:54,521
Send all the boys.
Close off all the roads!

785
01:35:18,004 --> 01:35:19,323
Dasha!

786
01:35:20,123 --> 01:35:21,715
Dasha! Over here.

787
01:35:33,483 --> 01:35:35,871
What do you want? Haven`t you
had enough of a beating?

788
01:35:36,682 --> 01:35:37,558
Hi.

789
01:35:38,842 --> 01:35:40,480
Quick. What do you want?

790
01:35:40,962 --> 01:35:45,318
l came for you. Russians don`t desert
their own in the war. What`s that?

791
01:35:45,641 --> 01:35:47,916
What? What war?
Are you insane?

792
01:35:48,441 --> 01:35:51,637
Wait, l`ve got to buy a gun.
Help me.

793
01:35:52,321 --> 01:35:54,915
- What for?
- l need it.

794
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,191
- You got any dough?
- Yes.

795
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,868
l need an automatic pistol
with a thirty-round clip.

796
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:04,030
Well, if you`re lucky...
Two hundred bucks for me.

797
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:06,831
Deal.

798
01:36:45,316 --> 01:36:47,432
Translate, l don`t
understand English.

799
01:36:53,156 --> 01:36:56,431
- Two grand. Show him the money.
- Tell him to show me the gun.

800
01:36:56,915 --> 01:36:58,951
Show him the gun.

801
01:37:12,593 --> 01:37:15,903
Two grand for both of them
orjust for one?

802
01:37:16,273 --> 01:37:18,343
For one. Show the money.

803
01:37:27,192 --> 01:37:28,750
lt`s dark in here.

804
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:52,465
l told you, l`ve come for you.

805
01:38:08,149 --> 01:38:09,025
ldiot!

806
01:38:19,028 --> 01:38:19,983
lt`s all over.

807
01:38:20,308 --> 01:38:21,979
Do you know this poem?

808
01:38:22,187 --> 01:38:24,986
l discovered that l`ve got
Relatives, and they`re my lot.

809
01:38:26,667 --> 01:38:29,227
Fuck you, snowflake.

810
01:38:29,387 --> 01:38:32,584
They are woods that are so dear
Fields of corn and every ear

811
01:38:32,747 --> 01:38:36,022
l`ll cut your ass.

812
01:38:36,386 --> 01:38:40,265
Streams of water, skies of blue
l will tell them: ``l love you``.

813
01:38:40,426 --> 01:38:44,054
You white shithead! l`ll blow your head off!

814
01:38:44,266 --> 01:38:46,221
lt`s the Homeland of mine.

815
01:38:47,465 --> 01:38:48,944
l will love it all the time.

816
01:38:49,226 --> 01:38:51,500
Marilyn. Come here, you bitch!

817
01:39:02,744 --> 01:39:04,143
ls there a back way
out of here?

818
01:39:14,103 --> 01:39:16,537
Hi! What are you doing?

819
01:39:17,303 --> 01:39:18,418
l`m running!

820
01:39:25,142 --> 01:39:28,418
Mr.Belkin, we`ve transferred
the money.

821
01:39:29,742 --> 01:39:31,733
We`re up and running,
as they say.

822
01:39:33,101 --> 01:39:35,695
Your reputation and your word
speak for themselves.

823
01:39:38,261 --> 01:39:40,013
But you`ve got problems.

824
01:39:40,941 --> 01:39:43,534
Like l said, l sort it out -

825
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:50,377
You don`t take chances
with this kind of money.

826
01:39:56,739 --> 01:39:59,014
What does `how are you` mean?

827
01:39:59,779 --> 01:40:01,178
lt means `how are you`.

828
01:40:02,219 --> 01:40:05,449
- Do they really mean it?
- No, they do not.

829
01:40:06,299 --> 01:40:08,858
- Then why do they ask?
- They just ask.

830
01:40:09,138 --> 01:40:10,935
But they are dead serious
when it comes to money.

831
01:40:13,738 --> 01:40:14,932
l`m hungry.

832
01:40:17,498 --> 01:40:18,976
Look, crawfish climb out
right onto the pier

833
01:40:19,898 --> 01:40:22,695
and no one bothers
to catch them.

834
01:40:23,777 --> 01:40:27,850
- Maybe he isn`t coming?
- He`ll come.

835
01:40:50,055 --> 01:40:50,884
Brother...

836
01:41:02,414 --> 01:41:03,812
Eight years is a long time.

837
01:41:05,493 --> 01:41:07,290
l wasn`t even twenty then.

838
01:41:09,693 --> 01:41:12,844
University, Perestroika,
America, Coca-Cola.

839
01:41:15,133 --> 01:41:17,168
Got married, then got divorced.

840
01:41:19,452 --> 01:41:23,127
l worked for an escort
service in New York. l was a call girl.

841
01:41:25,891 --> 01:41:27,688
Then coke, crack.

842
01:41:29,171 --> 01:41:31,810
l went to Chicago with one
fattie. He dumped me.

843
01:41:34,291 --> 01:41:35,963
Then l got mixed up with
that black jerk.

844
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:38,727
Oh, one shouldn`t speak
ill of the dead.

845
01:41:39,290 --> 01:41:41,246
Anyway, it`s all boring
and dull.

846
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:45,958
You know it was 1984
when l last sat at the campfire.

847
01:41:47,130 --> 01:41:49,166
We went camping at
Glukhoe Lake...

848
01:41:51,329 --> 01:41:53,843
Come home with us.
lt`s OK there.

849
01:41:54,529 --> 01:41:57,601
- And what will l do there?
- What are you doing here?

850
01:42:00,529 --> 01:42:03,601
l like it here. America is the world`s
driving power!

851
01:42:04,248 --> 01:42:09,321
- What is its power, brother?
- lt`s the money, brother.

852
01:42:09,847 --> 01:42:12,680
Money rules the world. Whoever
has the most is the strongest.

853
01:42:15,167 --> 01:42:18,443
Suppose, you`ve got a lot of money.
What would you do?

854
01:42:19,327 --> 01:42:22,204
- l`d buy everyone.
- Even me?

855
01:42:32,326 --> 01:42:34,395
What does he want?
Some crawfish?

856
01:42:35,445 --> 01:42:36,799
What do you want?

857
01:42:37,086 --> 01:42:39,121
Dirt. He says the food`s dirty.

858
01:42:39,285 --> 01:42:41,674
Crawfish eat the dirt.
We shouldn`t eat them.

859
01:42:43,445 --> 01:42:45,400
What? Dirt?

860
01:42:46,845 --> 01:42:49,802
Look at you Black scum.

861
01:42:49,924 --> 01:42:52,444
You need a good scrub! Get lost!

862
01:42:52,444 --> 01:42:54,400
Leave him. Negro, go, go!

863
01:42:54,764 --> 01:42:58,552
Who are you calling Negro?
l`ll show you a real Negro.

864
01:42:58,724 --> 01:43:01,317
- You shouldn`t call him a Negro.
- And who is he?

865
01:43:01,923 --> 01:43:04,517
- He`s an Afro-American.
- What`s the difference?

866
01:43:05,483 --> 01:43:07,553
Nigger sounds offensive to them.

867
01:43:07,882 --> 01:43:10,761
That`s what l was taught at
school. The Chinese live in China,

868
01:43:11,322 --> 01:43:14,997
the Germans live in Germany, the Jews
in lsrael & Negroes in Africa.

869
01:43:15,602 --> 01:43:20,312
l think the power`s in them.
There`s something primordial

870
01:43:21,002 --> 01:43:25,279
& brutal about these people. We lost it,
that`s why they`re stronger.

871
01:43:26,361 --> 01:43:28,477
The whites know it and they`re
afraid of them.

872
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:40,672
- We`d better go.
- Bastards, they spoiled the party.

873
01:45:03,033 --> 01:45:05,627
What are you doing here?
- A toilet.

874
01:45:05,953 --> 01:45:07,783
Back there.

875
01:45:24,631 --> 01:45:25,620
Richard.

876
01:45:25,950 --> 01:45:30,501
Remember l asked you
about a Russian hockey player in Chicago?

877
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:35,068
Be on the look out!
A Russian professional came to get you.

878
01:45:35,190 --> 01:45:39,899
l`ll send a photograph of him to you
over lnternet.

879
01:45:40,029 --> 01:45:42,338
He`s already in Chicago.

880
01:45:42,870 --> 01:45:46,145
We have to look after each other.

881
01:45:58,068 --> 01:46:00,343
- Can l help you, sir?
- Mr. Mennis`s office.

882
01:46:03,027 --> 01:46:05,302
Your name, sir?

883
01:46:19,106 --> 01:46:22,462
Can l talk to Mr. Mennis?

884
01:46:28,065 --> 01:46:31,137
No, thank you.

885
01:46:36,065 --> 01:46:39,215
He`s at the Metro Club
He`ll be back late at night.

886
01:46:43,864 --> 01:46:45,694
Don`t bother waiting.
He`s cheated on you.

887
01:46:47,343 --> 01:46:49,015
Something could happen to him.

888
01:46:50,303 --> 01:46:52,180
l think he`s just a jerk.

889
01:46:53,383 --> 01:46:54,418
He`s my brother!

890
01:46:58,423 --> 01:47:00,299
OK, let`s go see Mennis.

891
01:48:59,252 --> 01:49:01,208
Don`t shoot.

892
01:49:06,012 --> 01:49:07,888
Where`s Mennis?

893
01:49:11,891 --> 01:49:13,244
Money.

894
01:49:25,370 --> 01:49:26,598
Where`s Mennis?

895
01:49:28,010 --> 01:49:31,206
ln Mennis`s office.

896
01:49:31,489 --> 01:49:34,925
lt`s all in cash there.

897
01:50:12,685 --> 01:50:17,554
l discovered that l`ve got
Relatives and they`re my lot.

898
01:50:17,965 --> 01:50:22,914
They are woods that are so dear
Fields of corn and every ear.

899
01:50:24,325 --> 01:50:28,954
Streams of water, skies of blue.
l shall tell them: ``l love you!``

900
01:50:29,324 --> 01:50:32,396
lt`s the Homeland of mine.

901
01:50:40,323 --> 01:50:43,076
...and they`re my lot.

902
01:50:43,523 --> 01:50:48,881
They are woods that are so dear
Fields of corn and every ear.

903
01:50:49,203 --> 01:50:54,993
Streams of water, skies of blue.
l shall tell them: ``l love you!``

904
01:50:55,402 --> 01:50:59,953
lt`s the Homeland of mine.
l will love it all the time.

905
01:51:10,841 --> 01:51:17,234
l discovered that l`ve got
Relatives and they`re my lot.

906
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:23,196
They are woods that are so dear
Fields of corn and every ear.

907
01:52:11,636 --> 01:52:15,264
- How are you?
- Thank you. l`m OK.

908
01:52:15,555 --> 01:52:17,307
That`s great.

909
01:52:17,595 --> 01:52:21,144
Ah, Russian vodka! Good.

910
01:52:26,714 --> 01:52:27,624
Come on.

911
01:52:50,192 --> 01:52:54,868
American, what`s your power?
ls it really money?

912
01:52:56,752 --> 01:52:58,821
My brother says it`s money.

913
01:52:59,831 --> 01:53:01,708
You`ve got lots of money -
so what?

914
01:53:02,591 --> 01:53:06,869
Truth is a real power.
Whoever is right is strong.

915
01:53:08,271 --> 01:53:10,545
You cheated on a man
and took away his money.

916
01:53:10,990 --> 01:53:12,548
Did it make you stronger?

917
01:53:13,030 --> 01:53:15,066
No, it did not.

918
01:53:16,510 --> 01:53:18,625
Cos you are not right.

919
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:21,738
And the person you cheated on is.

920
01:53:23,029 --> 01:53:24,382
That means he`s stronger.

921
01:53:25,749 --> 01:53:26,784
Right?

922
01:53:28,389 --> 01:53:29,424
Right.

923
01:53:34,308 --> 01:53:37,061
Dmitry Gromov, gimme his money.

924
01:53:55,466 --> 01:53:57,502
So, play hockey.

925
01:53:59,546 --> 01:54:03,380
Will my money keep on going
to Mennis` account?

926
01:54:03,946 --> 01:54:05,663
Tell them to make transfers
to your account.

927
01:54:07,305 --> 01:54:09,694
- What about the contract?
- Forget it.

928
01:54:13,505 --> 01:54:15,735
He did not pay me
the interest on this money.

929
01:54:21,464 --> 01:54:23,056
You are like your brother...

930
01:54:38,263 --> 01:54:40,378
Give up, Russian!

931
01:54:41,662 --> 01:54:43,334
Russians never give up!

932
01:54:56,261 --> 01:55:00,049
- Hey, what`s happening here?
- Russian Mafia.

933
