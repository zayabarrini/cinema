Wushu is not for revenge.

In order for others
to respect you,

111

how to respect others.

everyone will fear me.

are two different things.

please forgive me.

I did my best

to keep everything the way
it was for you to return home.

Why do foreigners
look down on us?

Because we're not united.

646
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:37,982
It's a fact. For years, we
fought, Chinese against Chinese.

That's why

But it was so profitable.

compared to your vision.

660

Yuanjia, I don't know wushu,

661
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:40,961
but I do know how to help.

662
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:44,798
I hope it will be enough.

Jingwu Sports Federation

664
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:54,266
As we've discussed, the
Jingwu Federation handbook.

665
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:55,893
Take a look.

666
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:01,065
"The Jingwu motto
has three parts:

667
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:04,360
"body, mind and soul.

668

one's body, mind and soul.

are respected equally.

671
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:17,748
<i>"we can better ourselves</i>

672
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:20,751
<i>"and stand strong
as one nation."</i>

673
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:22,961
We influence others

674
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:26,840
through cooperation,
not intimidation.

675
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:31,637
Through this ideal,
we will always stand strong!

676
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,223
Ready?

677
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:42,856
(IN ENGLISH) Well, gentlemen,
it's too rich for me.

678
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,900
I only bet on sure things.

679
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:50,406
Then perhaps you'd be interested
in joining our little wager

against this Yuanjia fellow.

681
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:57,871
I've suggested a competition
of four matches

682
01:21:57,955 --> 01:22:00,374
between our countries' best
against him.

683
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:04,128
We beat him and leave the Chinese
with nothing to brag about.

684
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:08,465
Mita, you are certain
Yuanjia will lose?

685
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:12,761
With what I have in mind,
our victory is guaranteed.

688
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:38,078
One of the Japanese

689
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:40,581
Tanaka, wishes to meet you.

690

Ihear
he remains undefeated.

691
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:50,591
Good, one can always
learn from the best.

692
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:53,802
Yuanjia, I suspect that the
Foreign Chamber of Commerce

693
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:55,596
might have a hidden agenda.

694
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:59,141
How can they set up
a four-against-one contest?

695
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:03,437
I suspect it is
an attempt to humiliate us

696
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:07,483
and undermine the Jingwu
Sports Federation in Shanghai.

697
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:10,194
You're right.

698
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:14,531
Four against one is unfair,
and I have to win every match.

699
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:22,372
Yet who is to guarantee that
everything in life is fair?

700
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:27,794
For the sake
of the Federation,

701
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:31,089
I have no other choice.

702
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:32,591
What if...

703
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:36,970
Jinsun, there's something
I want to ask you.

704
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:38,639
What is it?

705
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:43,018
After the contest, I need
you to run the Federation.

706
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:44,478
Why?

707
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:49,233
I want to visit
Moon and Grandma.

708
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,069
I promised Moon
I would return.

709
01:23:59,076 --> 01:24:03,539
Do you know anything
about teas, Mr. Huo?

710
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:10,003
I don't really want to know
because I don't like categories.

711
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:11,838
Tea is tea.

712
01:24:11,922 --> 01:24:15,384
Each has its own characteristics,
hence different grades.

713
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:18,971
What's the purpose
of grading?

714
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:23,684
All teas are grown in nature with
little discernable differences.

715
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:28,105
Once you learn,
you can tell the difference.

716
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:30,816
Maybe you're right.

717
01:24:31,024 --> 01:24:32,693
The way I see it,

718
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:36,863
the tea is not in a position
to judge itself.

719
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:41,493
We should let people
be the judge of the tea.

720
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:44,746
As for me,
I don't want to do that.

721
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:47,624
Why not?

722
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:50,919
When you are in a good mood,

723
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:55,299
the grade of the tea
does not matter.

724
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:57,593
I've never seen it that way.

725
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:02,097
Even with the various wushu
styles, you still claim

726
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:06,351
that no one style
is superior to the others?

727
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:08,186
That's what I believe.

728
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:12,107
Then I have another question.

729
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:15,694
If no particular style
is superior,

730
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:18,113
why have
so many competitions?

731
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:22,367
I believe it is impossible to claim the
superiority of one style over another.

732
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:26,788
It's just that the people who practice
them have different skill levels.

733
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:30,208
Competitions can help us
uncover our weaknesses

734
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:35,047
and discover that
we are our own true enemy.

735
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:46,892
Mr. Huo,
your words are poignant.

736
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:52,064
Please enjoy.
Thank you.

737

The fourth and final contest
will now begin.

738
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:18,340
In this round,
Tanaka of Japan will fight

739
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:21,301
Huo Yuanjia of China's
Jingwu Sports Federation.

740
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:23,637
(IN JAPANESE) This is unfair.

741
01:26:25,138 --> 01:26:27,015
Four against one?

742
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:30,352
You never told me.

743
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:34,398
Both the Chamber of Commerce
and the Federation agreed.

744
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:36,108
Don't be concerned.

745
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,360
This is not a competition.

746
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:41,196
This is murder.

747
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:43,615
Tanaka, you're overreacting.

748
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:47,244
Huo Yuanjia has fought the best
fighters from around the world

749
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,996

what's your deal?

752
01:26:55,877 --> 01:27:00,507
Is this really for Japan's national pride?
Or did you place a large bet?

753
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:04,886
