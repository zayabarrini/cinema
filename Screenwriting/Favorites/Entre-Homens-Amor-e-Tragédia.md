# The Banshees Of Inisherin (2022)

Colm?

Are you coming out to the pub, Colm?

It's 2:00, like.

Will I see you down there, so?

I'll see you down there, so.

What are you doin' home?

Brother?

What are you doin' home?

I knocked on ColmSonnyLarry.

He's just sitting there.

Sitting there doin' what?

Sittin' there doin' nothing.

Smoking.

Was he asleep?

He was smoking, Siobhan.

How do you smoke in your sleep, like?

Have ye been rowing?

We haven't been rowin'.

I don't think we've been rowin'.

Have we been rowin'?

Why wouldn't he answer the door to me?

Maybe he just doesn't like you no more.

Pint, Jonjo.

Is Colm not with you?

No.Colm's always with you.

I know.Did you not knock for him?

I did knock for him.

Well, where is he? Just sittin' there.

Sittin' there doin' what?

Sittin' there doing nothin'.

Smokin'.

Have ye been rowin'?

I don't think we've been rowin'.

Sounds like ye've been rowin'.

It does sound like we've been rowin'.

Will I try him again?

That'd be the best thing.

Officer Kearney.

Never says "hello."

Never fecking says "hello."

Colm?

Colm?

The door was open, Colm.

Colm?

Where the hell are you headin' off to?

Everybody?JONJO: No, this is true.

He scored six points from open play.

He was barely the size of a dwarf!

This is true!

Howdo. MAN: Howdo, Padraic.

Sit somewhere else.

Huh?

Uh... But I have me pint there, Colm.

He has his pint there, Colm, from when he came in and ordered his pint from before.

Okay.

I'll sit somewhere else, so.

Are ye rowin'?

I didn't think we were rowin'.

Well, ye are rowin'.

Well, ye are rowin'.

He's sittin' outside on his own like a whatchamacallit.

It does look like we're rowin'.

Well, I suppose

I'd best go talk to him, so.

See what all this is fecking about.

That'd be the best thing.

Now I'm sittin' here next to you, and if you're goin' back inside,

I'm followin' you inside, and if you're goin' home,

I'm followin' you there, too.

Now, if I've done somethin' to ya, just tell me what I've done to ya.

And if I've said somethin' to ya, maybe I said somethin' when

I was drunk, and I've forgotten it, but I don't think I said somethin' when

I was drunk, and I've forgotten it.

But if I did, then tell me what it was, and I'll say sorry for that too, Colm.

With all me heart, I'll say sorry.

Just stop running away from me like some fool of a moody schoolchild.

But you didn't say anything to me.

And you didn't do anything to me.

That's what I was thinking, like.

I just don't like you no more.

You do like me.

I don't.

But you liked me yesterday.

Oh, did I, yeah?

I thought you did.

Padraic.

Dominic.

What's the matter with ya?

There's nothing the matter with me, for God's sake.

Look at this I found.

A stick with a hook.

What would you use it for, I wonder?

To hook things that were the length of a stick away?

Where you goin'?

Down here.

As good a plan as any!

Have you any fags?No.

Uh, you do.

You always have fags.

ColmSonnyLarry's at Jonjo's handing out a rake of fags.

Whoever's in the mood for one.

Is he?No!

You're behavin' awful unusual.

What are you doin' here?

Was the pub closed?

No, it was open.

Anything in the paper?

Just the Civil War still.Ugh.

A bad do.

Mrs. McCormick's comin' over later, Padraic.

I couldn't avoid her.

I don't know if you're gonna be in or out, but you're usually out.

Am I?

You are.

Yeah, you know you are.

I don't care, Siobhan.

This is your house, too.

Is it six years since your mammy and daddy died, Siobhan, or is it seven years since they died?

It's coming up to eight years,

Mrs. McCormick, aye.

Is it comin' up to eight years?

Doesn't time be flyin'?

Aye, when you're havin' fun.

Oh, be off to the pub now, Padraic, if you're gonna be annoyin' us.

I don't have to be down there every night, do I?

ColmSonnyLarry's scared him off, I suppose.

What did you hear of ColmSonnyLarry?

Didn't you and he used to be the best of friends?

We're still the best of friends.

No, you're not. Who says we're not?

She says.

Ah, for God's sake, Siobhan.

I said nothing of the like,

Mrs. McCormick! I was just chatting.

Now, you go off to Jonjo's, Padraic, and don't be getting under our feet.

Sure, Mrs. McCormick never gets a chance to come over for a chat.

She never gets a chance 'cause you avoid her.

I do not avoid her!

You hide behind walls if she's coming up the road.

I do not! h... hide behind walls.

Good luck to ye.

Whatever it is you're fightin' about.

I didn't hear there was to be a session.

Last-minute thing.

Colm decided.

All the ladies love Colm, you know. Always did.

Yeah? That's not true.

You're still barred,

Dominic! Out!

You said barred until April.

What are we now?

April.

Well, put that stick outside anyways, and don't be bothering the women.

There's women?

There is women.

And good ones.

If we sat next to Colm, the women would have to talk to us too, and then we could get at them with our small talk.

I'm happy enough sittin' here, now.

Are ya, yeah?

Are ya happy enough, yeah?

I can't stand the maudlin' ones.

Play somethin' dancey, Colm!

To dance to.

And not have that mope whining.

Here, amn't I in enough trouble with him without your mouthing?

What trouble in are you in with him?

Uh, he just... doesn't want to be friends with me no more.

What is he, 12?

Why does he not want to be friends with you no more?

Shh.

Daddy'll kill us if we wake him when he's been wanking.

You won't get into trouble for taking his poteen?

I will get into trouble, but fuck it.

I saw cannon-fire and rifle-fire on the mainland tonight.

Did you see it?

That'll be the Civil War.

I know that, sure.

Me, I pay no attention to wars. I'm agin 'em.

Wars and soap.

I tell you this much.

We're good at chatting, aren't we?

Me and you?

Your sister, does she like to chat?

Not as much as most women, but she'll chat, like.

She more likes reading.

Reading?

Feckin' hell.

Reading.

And did you ever see her with no clothes on?

I didn't.

Did you not, and you her brother?

Not even as a child?

I don't like to be chattin' about these types of things, Dominic!

What types of things?

Sisters with no clothes on!

You saw my daddy with no clothes on.

And till the day I die,

I'll wish I hadn't.

Sure, don't I know it.

The tiny, brown cock on him.

What's the matter with him?

Maybe bad news he's had?

Daddy?

No, ColmSonnyLarry.

Didn't I tell ya I'd be off if you went whining about that lummox one more time?

I tell ya, it didn't look like he had bad news tonight.

It looked like a weight was lifted from his shoulders tonight.

Just bringing me cows past.

What?

I was just bringing me cows past.

I wasn't, you know, trying to...

You don't usually bring them this way.

I don't, but then the little fella took a fright at a hen on the corner, so...

I only...

I only just saw what month we changed to yesterday.

More fool me?

Changed to April.

So, will I be callin' for ya on me way to the pub later?

I will so.

Anyways,

I better chase after these goons for they're gettin' away from me.

Maybe they don't like me no more neither.

See you at 2:00, so, Colm.

Why don't you come down for a sherry later?

There's no need to be stuck inside on a nice day.

I will so.

How's the book?

It's sad.

Sad?

Well, you should read a not sad one, Siobhan, else you might get sad.

Hmm.

Do you never get lonely, Padraic?

Never get what?

Lonely.

Do I never get lonely?

What's the matter with everybody?

Jesus.

"Lonely." Fecking hell.

Colm?

Pint, Jonjo.

How's he seem?

Grand, I think.

With me, anyways.

What are you doing?

Oh, so you're gonna be an eejit again today, is it?

Amn't I allowed to have a quiet pint on me own, Padraic?

Well, don't ask a man to call up to ya at your fecking house, so, like he has nothing better to do with his fecking time.

I didn't ask you to call up to me at me house.

And you do have nothing better to do with your fecking time.

Huh?

You do have nothing better to do with your fecking time.

I know I've nothing better to do with me fecking time, but there's better things I could be doing with me fecking time than to be calling up to ya at your house, Colm Doherty!

Like what?

Huh?

Like what else could you be doin'?

Reading.

Reading, yeah?

Me, this morning... this I wrote.

Tomorrow, I'll write the second part of it.

And the day after, I'll write the third part of it.

And by Wednesday, there'll be a new tune in the world, which wouldn't have been there if I'd spent the week listening to your bollocks,

Padraic Suilleabhain.

So, do you want to take your pint outside, or do you want me to take my pint outside?

I'll take my pint outside,

'cause it's a shite tune anyways,

I wouldn't bother with it.

I was too harsh yesterday.

Yesterday, he says.

I know well you was too harsh yesterday.

And today.

I just, uh...

I just have this tremendous sense of time slippin' away on me, Padraic.

And I think I need to spend the time I have left thinking and composing.

Just trying not to listen to any more of the dull things that you have to say for yourself.

But I'm sorry about it.

I am, like.

Are you dying?

No, I'm not dying.

But then you've loads of time.

For chatting?

Aye.For aimless chatting?

Not for aimless chatting.

For good, normal chatting.

So, we'll keep aimlessly chatting and me life'll keep dwindling.

And in 12 years, I'll die with nothin' to show for it bar the chats I've had with a limited man, is that it?

I said, "Not aimless chatting."

I said, "Good, normal chatting."

The other night, two hours you spent talking to me about the things you found in your little donkey's shite that day.

Two hours, Padraic.

I timed it.

Well, it wasn't me little donkey's shite, was it?

It was me pony's shite, which shows how much you were listenin'.

None of it helps me, do you understand?

None of it helps me.

We'll just chat about somethin' else then.

What's the matter with ya?

Nothin'.

Aren't we going for a sherry?

Don't feel like it.

No, I'm not having this again today!

Hey! What the hell's going on with you and me fecking brother?

Don't come in here shouting the odds at me in the middle of the fecking day, all right, Siobhan?

You can't just all of a sudden stop being friends with a fella!

Why can't I?

Why can't ya?

Because it isn't nice.

Do you want a sherry, Siobhan?

No!Righty-ho.

Has he said somethin' to ya when he was drunk?

No, I prefer him when he's drunk.

It's all the rest of the time

I have the problem with.

What's the fecking matter, then?

He's dull, Siobhan.

He's what?

He's dull.

But he's always been dull.

What's changed?

I've changed.

I just don't have a place for dullness in me life anymore.

But you live on an island off the coast of Ireland, Colm.

What the hell are you hoping for, like?

For a bit of peace, Siobhan.

That's all.

For a bit of peace in me heart, like.

You can understand that.

Can't ya?

Can't ya?

Do you think I'm dull?

No. 'Cause you're not dull, you're nice.

That's what I thought.

I mean, I'm a happy lad.

Or I was.

Till me best friend started acting the gilly-gooly.

It's him, Padraic.

Maybe he's just depressed.

That's what I was thinking, that he's depressed.

Well, if he is, he could at least keep it to himself, like.

You know, push it down, like the rest of us.

- No, Jenny!

- Out!

Out!

She just wants a bit of company, Siobhan.

Animals is for outside,

I've told ya.

And people don't be laughing at me behind me back, do they?

No. Why would they be?

They don't think I'm dim or anything?

Dim?

No.

You don't seem very sure about it.

Of course, I'm sure about it.

Dominic's the dim one on the island, isn't he?

He is, aye. By miles.

Uh, hang on, by miles.

And then, who's the next dimmest?

Well, I don't like to judge people in those terms now, do I?

In what terms?In order of their dimness.

Well, I know you don't.

And neither do I, do I?

But try, like.No!

I won't try.

There's enough judgy people on this fecking island, so no!

You're not dim!

You're a nice man, all right?

So, move on!

I'm as clever as you, anyways.

I know that at least.

Yeah, don't be fecking stupid.

Huh?

What happened to you?

Me daddy discovered the poteen situation.

Oh, Jesus, Dominic!

You poor thing, ya.

What the hell was he hittin' you with?

A kettle was the final thing.

I wouldn'ta minded, but for the spout.

Do you want a ride to church?

Uh, feck them gobshites!

Dominic!

But could I stay the night with ye the night?

Just for the one night, like?

Mm...

Well, just the one night, mind.

Nice! I'll see ye for supper, so.

Whoo-hoo!

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

It's eight weeks since my last confession,

I think.

Go on, Colm.

Just the usual, I suppose, Father.

The drinking and the impure thoughts.

And a bit of pride, I suppose.

Although I never really saw that as a sin, but sure I'm here now.

And how's the despair?

Not so much of it of late.

Thanks be.

And why aren't you talking to

Padraic Suilleabhain no more?

That wouldn't be a sin, now, would it, Father?

It wouldn't be a sin, no, but it's not very nice either, is it?

Who told you?

It's an island, Colm.

Word gets around.

Also, Padraic asked me to put in a word, like.

I see.

So...

It isn't him you have the impure thoughts about, is it?

Are you joking me?

I mean, are you fecking joking me?

People do have impure thoughts about men, too.

Do you have impure thoughts about men, Father?

I do not have impure thoughts about men.

And how dare you say that about a man of the cloth?

Well, you started it.

Well, you can get out of my confessional right now, so you can.

And I'm not forgiving you any of these things until the next time, so I'm not!

Well, I better not be dying in the meantime then, eh, Father?

I'll be pure fucked!

You will be pure fucked!

Yes, you will be pure fucked!

Pint, Colm?

If you don't stop talkin' to me, and if you don't stop botherin' me, or sendin' your sister or your priest to bother me...

I didn't send me sister to bother you, did I?

She has her own mind.

Although, I did send the priest though, you have me there.

What I've decided to do is this.

I have a set of shears at home.

And each time you bother me from this day on,

I'll take those shears and I'll take one of me fingers off with them.

And I'll give that finger to ya.

A finger from me left hand.

Me fiddle hand.

And each day you bother me more, another I'll take off and I'll give ya until you see sense enough to stop.

Or until I have no fingers left.

Does this make things clearer to ya?

Not really, no.

Because I don't want to hurt your feelings, Padraic.

I don't, like.

But it feels like the drastic is the only option left open to me.

You've loads of options left open to ya.

How's fingers the first port of call?

Please, don't talk to me no more, Padraic. Please.

I'm begging you.

But...JONJO: Shush, like, Padraic.

Just, you know, shush, like.Yeah, I'd shush, like.

I will shush.

Except me and me sister were thinking you might just be a bit depressed, Colm.

And I tell you this much, fingers just confirms it.

Don't you think, Colm?

Starting from now.

Well, I never heard the like.

I never heard the like.

He must really not like you, Padraic.

Fingers!

Jesus. He's serious, lads.

He is serious!

You can see it in his eyes he's serious.

Just because he thinks you're dull.

That's going overboard!

Who told you about the dull?

Well, I overheard it.

Like, what was I supposed to do?

I don't think you're dull.

And jeez, if I was to cut something off meself for every dull person that came in here,

I'd only have me head left.

Do you think I'm dull, Gerry?

No.

That said,

I did think the two of ye always made a funny pairing, like.

No, we didn't.JONJO: Yeah, ye did.

Ye did. Obviously, ye did.

'Cause now he'd rather maim himself than talk to ya.

Colm was always more of a thinker.

Huh?

Why's every... I think.

Ah, you don't, Padraic.

You don't, Padraic.Your sister does.

Your sister does, aye.

Siobhan does.You're more of a...

You're more of a...

What is he?

You're more one of life's good guys.

You're more one of life's good guys, aye.

Apart from when you're drunk.

Apart from when you're drunk, aye.

I used to think that'd be a nice thing to be.

One of life's good guys.

And now, it sounds like the worst thing I ever heard.

Ah, don't take it like that, Padraic.

Don't take it like that, Padraic.

We're on your side.

What are you smiling at?

What's this mope so mopey for?

He's just a fecking man, lads!

A fat, ginger man!

Ay yi yi.

I'll tell ya this much.

Ye two are awful mopey hosts.

Luckily, you won't have to put up with us more than one night, so, and try eatin' with your mouth closed.

Where are we now, France?

Will you tell him, Padraic?

Aye, stop being a little fecking bollocks, Dominic.

No. Just about the mouth thing.

Colm Doherty and his fat fecking fingers.

He probably wouldn't even be able to cut through the blubber on them fingers.

Would you not want him to have to do the one finger to see if he was bluffing, like?

No, we wouldn't.

That's what I'd have him do,

I'd have him do the one finger to see if he was bluffin'.

'Cause worst comes to worst, he can still play the fiddle with four fingers, I'll bet ya.

Or the banjo.

We don't want any of that.

We just want nothing to do with him no more.

You don't. This gom does.

I am a gom, is right.

You're not a gom!

Jeez.

This is a depressing house.

Would you prefer your own, so?

I've heard it's a barrel of fecking laughs.

Well, touche.

Too what?

Che. Touche.

It's from the French.

And how is it, Siobhan, that you was never married?

It's none of your fecking business how I was never fecking married.

How isn't it?

How isn't it?

Was you never wild?

Wild? Was I never wild?

I don't know what you're talkin' about, Dominic.

Wild, how? Angry?

'Cause I'm gettin' angry now,

I can tell ya!

Not angry. Wild.

You just keep sayin' wild, Dominic!

Wild!My brother told you, didn't he?

That you'd be out in the road if you started talking stupid to me?

He said creepy, not stupid.

Well, you've failed on both counts, haven't ya?

I have.

I'm off to bed and he's not stayin' here another night, Padraic.

I don't care how depressed you are.

I'd rather have the donkey in.

Foiled again.

But "faint heart" and all that.

Here.

Ye two, ye'll be all right.

Will we be?

Hello there, Mrs. O'Riordan,

I've the milk outside for ya.

So, it's the two weeks you owe me for now, I think.

Nobody has a lick of news for us from your side of the island, Padraic.

Are you going to be the same as them?

I am, Mrs. O'Riordan, I'm afraid.

And I'm in a bit of a rush, so...

Eileen Coughlan had no news.

Vincent Shaughnessy had no news.

It was a poor old week for news.

But then it is, sometimes.

ColmSonnyLarry, he had no news.

Did he not?

That man never talks.

Eh, he talks sometimes.Up himself.

Aye, aye, anyways, so, it's the two weeks you owe me for now, Mrs. O'Riordan.

As I was sayin'.

Ladies.

Oh, it's Peadar.

Peadar always has a rake of news.

What news have you, Peadar?PEADAR: News, is it?

Fella killed himself, over Rosmuck way.

Walked into a lake for himself.

Twenty-nine and nothing wrong with him, the fool.

God love us!

No, not "God love us." Fool!

Another fella,

Protestant, of course, stabbed his missus in Letterkenny.

Six times he stabbed her.

Good God!

And did she die, Peadar?

She did die, aye.

It wasn't with a spoon he was stabbin' her.

That's a lot of news.

This man has no news, don't ya not? No-Newsy!

Stukes never have news.MRS. O'RIORDAN: Stukes!

Funny.

There was a bit of news

I remembered, Mrs. O'Riordan.

Dominic Kearney's father beat Dominic senseless with a kettle Saturday, and is staying with me and me sister, Dominic is.

So, at least his father'll take a bit of a break from his beatin' of him.

And him, a policeman.

Isn't that news?

Ar, that Dominic's an awful little bollocks.

That's no news.

Still, he was in a bad way when I came upon him.

I'd beat him with a kettle meself if I wasn't old.

It's news is all I'm sayin'.

That's no news.

That's shite news.

Okay, so, Mrs. O'Riordan, thanks for the...

I'll see ya when I see ya.

And you can tell that skitter of a son of mine he'd better be home by teatime, or it's over to batter the both of ye I'll be, and your dreary fecking sister, too!

Oh, hello there, Colm.

Will I see you at Jonjo's tonight for that pint you owe me?

I owe you no pin...

You will, Peadar.

Good man yourself.

Whoa, stand.

Stand.

What's that, Jenny?

Will we go to the pub for ourselves?

We will. Come on.

One drink you're havin', lady, then it's off home with ya.

I've a shirt that wants ironing for the morning.

Okay, Daddy.

Aye. Off to the mainland in the morning I'm headin'.

That's why I need the clean shirt, like.

"And why are you off to the mainland in the mornin', Peadar?"

Oh, thanks for asking, Colm.

I'll tell ya why.

They've asked for extra manpower for a couple of the executions in case there's any kind of a to-do, like.

Six bob and a free lunch they're payin' me.

And sure I'd have gone for nothin'.

I've always wanted to see an execution, haven't you?

Although, I'd have preferred a hanging.

Who are they executin'?

The Free State lads are executin' a couple of the IRA lads.

Or is it the other way around?

I find it hard to follow these days.

Wasn't it so much easier when we was all on the same side, and it was just the English we was killin'?

I think it was.

I preferred it.

But you don't care who's executin' who?

For six bob and a free lunch,

I don't care!

They could be executin' you.

Why don't you come with me?

You could write a miserable feckin' song about it.

Nah, I'm only messin'.

Who are them?

Music students, I think, from Lisdoonvarna.

Another whisky, anyways, Jonjo.

Jeez, you're goin' at it at a fair old lick tonight, Padraic.

Yeah? What's it to ya?

Padraic, don't now...

Go get Siobhan, Dominic, would ya?

What are you after, gobshite?

Another beatin', is it?

You, copper, I'm allowed to chat to you, aren't I?

It's just tubbyguts

I'm not allowed to talk to.

Actually, no, I'd rather you didn't talk to me neither.

Oh, well, anyways, do you want to know what the three things that I hate the most on Inisherin is? Not really.

One, policemen.

Two, pudgy fiddle players.

And three...

Wait, I had some funny thing for three. What was it?

Uh, I'll start again. One, um, policemen.

Two...

Pudgy fiddle players.

Pudgy fiddle players.

And shite, what was three?

Go on back to your own gang now, Padraic.

I'm serious, now.

Serious, are ya?

And talkin' to me, are ya?

Siobhan!

Padraic's out of his brains on whisky, and Colm's there.

You'd better come.

You, Colm Doherty, do you know what you used to be?

No, Padraic, what did I used to be?

Nice!

You used to be nice!

Didn't he not?

And now, do you know what you are?

Not nice.

Ah, well,

I suppose niceness doesn't last then, does it, Padraic?

But will I tell ya something that does last?

What? And don't say somethin' stupid like music.

Music lasts.Knew it!

And paintings last.

And poetry lasts.

So does niceness.

Do you know who we remember for how nice they was in the 17th century?

Who? Absolutely no one.

Yet we all remember the music of the time.

Everyone, to a man, knows Mozart's name.

Well, I don't, so there goes that theory.

And anyway, we're talkin' about niceness.

Not whatsisname.

My mammy, she was nice.

I remember her.

And my daddy, he was nice.

I remember him.

And my sister, she's nice.

I'll remember her.

Forever I'll remember her.

And who else will?

PADRAIC: "Who else will" what?

Remember Siobhan and your niceness?

No one will.

In 50 years' time, no one will remember any of us.

Yet the music of a man who lived two centuries ago...

"Yet," he says, like he's English.

Come home, Padraic.

I don't give a feck about Mozart, or Borvoven, or any of them funny name feckers.

I'm Padraic Suilleabhain.

And I'm nice.

Come home.

So you'd rather be friends with this fella, would ya?

A fella who beats his own son black and blue every night that he's not fiddling with him.

I never told him that, Daddy.

He's... He's just drunk now.

You used to be nice.

Or did you never used to be?

Oh, God.

Maybe you never used to be.

I'll have a word with him, Colm.

You don't need to do anything drastic.

He won't be botherin' you no more.

That's a shame.

That's the most interesting he's ever been.

I think I like him again now.

It was the 18th century, anyway. Mozart.

Not the 17th.

Siobhan Suilleabhain!

Well, well.

I only came in for rashers, Mrs. O'Riordan.

I've no time to talk, I'm afraid.

Letter came for ya.

Fell open, did it?

Aye, in the heat, I suppose.

A job offer, is it?

A job offer from a library on the mainland, is it?

Just the rashers, please, Mrs. O'Riordan.

About ten of them.

You never tell me anything!

Well, it'd crucify him, your leaving!

Hey, no one's leaving!

Listen, I didn't come down to chat.

I just came down to say that all that last night was just the whisky talkin', Colm.

All what last night?

All whatever it was I was sayin'.

What were you sayin'?

Uh... Yeah.

I can't remember much of it, but I remember the gist of it wasn't the best.

You always know, don't ya?

Well, anyways, I just wanted to say I was sorry.

Will we leave it at that?

Why can't you just leave me alone, Padraic?

Huh?

I've already told ya, haven't I?

Yeah, I know. I was just...

I mean, why can't you just leave me alone?

What are ya doing?I don't know.

For fuck's sake, like.

How... How's the new tune?

What?

Ar, for God's sake, Padraic.

How many more times?

I am not putting me donkey outside when I am sad, okay?

Well, stringy bits of shite

I had to pick up yesterday when ya let her in!

There was no stringy bits in that donkey's shite.

There was bits of straw, if there was anything.

Maybe it was straw, so.

I'll get us our porridge.

Was I awful last night?

No, you was lovely.

Well, I know I wasn't lovely now, Siobhan.

You were lovely.

About me, anyways.

Of course I was lovely about you.

What else is there to be about ya?

What was that? A bird?

What was what?

The bang at the door.

A bird?

Aye.No.

What was it, so?

The bang at the door?Aye!

What was the bang at the door?

It was, uh... hard to lie... it was, uh... a finger.

A what?

Finger.

Jesus, Siobhan!

You'll frighten the little fella!

Throw it out, Padraic!

I'm not throwing his finger out!

It'll get dirt on it!

Where... Where'd you put it?

Shoebox.

Oh, my. Oh, God.

Well, he's serious, then.

Do we have to have it in here while we're eating?

Once I finish me porridge,

I'll bring it back to him.

Are you feckin' stupid?

I mean, are you feckin' stupid?

No, I'm not feckin' stupid.

We've had this discussion.

You've got to leave him alone now, Padraic. For good!

Do you think?

Do I think? Yeah, I do think!

He's cut his feckin' finger off, and thrown it at ya!

Come on! It wasn't at me.

Well, what are we going to do?

We can't keep a man's finger.

Jesus, Colm!

Did it hurt?

Hurt awful to begin with.

Thought I was going to faint.

It's funny, feels fine now, in all the excitement.

Would you like a cup of tea?

I won't, Colm. I only came up to give you your finger back.

Oh, yeah?

Thanks.

Cleared up quite nice, actually.

And you wouldn't have thought it would.

What do you need from him, Colm?

To end all this?

Silence, Siobhan.

Just silence.

One more silent man on Inisherin, good-oh!

Silence it is, so.

This isn't about Inisherin.

It's about one boring man leaving another man alone, that's all.

"One boring man"!

You're all fecking boring!

With your piddling grievances over nothin'!

You're all fecking boring!

I'll see he doesn't talk to you no more.

Do.

Else it'll be all four of them the next time, not just the one.

You're not serious.

Well, that won't help your fecking music.

Aye.

We're gettin' somewhere now.

I think you might be ill, Colm.

Do worry sometimes

I'm just entertaining meself while I stave off the inevitable.

Don't you?

No, I don't.

Yeah, you do.

Declan!

Howdo!

Howdo!

Do you want a ride?

I will so.

Thanks, fella!

Oh, no, you're not that student fella from Lisdoonvarna, are ya?

I am. I'm Declan.

Why?

They told me at the post office to try to find that student fella, Declan, from Lisdoonvarna.

Yeah, a telegram came for ya.

From your mammy.

My mammy is no longer with us.

Not your mammy, sorry.

Did I say your mammy?

Your auntie. Yeah, your auntie.

It's about your daddy.

What about Daddy?

Uh, bread van crashed into him.

The bread van?Yeah.

They said you'd best hurry home to him, lest he should die all alone.

Die?

Or get worse, all alone.

This is impossible.

It's not impossible.

Bread vans crash into people all the time.

I know!

That's how me mammy died.

If it's the same fecking bread van, I'll kill them.

Thanks.

What were you talking to the boat fella for?

For none of your fecking business, I think it was.

Of course, it's me business.

Aren't I the law?

Fecking knob.

Huh?

Well, you can tell that whiny brother of yours

I'll be around soon for that battering I owe him.

A battering?

That'd be good, actually.

It might take him out of himself.

Huh?

You're an awful strange lady.

No wonder no one likes ya.

Oh.

Hello there, Mrs. McCormick.

A death shall come to Inisherin afore the month is out.

A death, huh?

Maybe even two deaths.

Well, that'd be sad.

We shall pray to the Lord

'tis neither you, nor poor Siobhan, will be either of them.

Well, is that a nice thing to be sayin'?

I wasn't trying to be nice.

I was trying to be accurate.

Fecking hell.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

Me daddy say he's gonna kill you Sunday for spilling the beans about that fiddling with me.

"Kill me," kill me, or, you know,

"beat me up a bit," kill me?

"Beat you up a bit," kill ya, I think.

Although he did kill a man once.

I'm sorry for that spilling the beans on ya, Dominic.

I was out of order that night.

You was funny apart from that bit.

That's why I don't understand why that fat fella threw the finger at ya.

He seemed fine when you were slagging him.

He did not.

Did he?

"That's the most interesting

Padraic's ever been," he said.

"I think I like him again now."

Aye.

Maybe this whole thing has just been about gettin' you to try a new tack, start standin' up for yourself a bit.

Do you think?

Yeah, and be less of a, you know, whiny little dull-arse.

Well, I have been less of a whiny little dull-arse, actually.

Have ya, yeah?

Just yesterday, there was this musician fella that Colm was getting along great with.

And what did I do?

I went and sent him packing from the island.

Did ya? How?

I told him a bread van crashed into his daddy, and he'd have to be rushing home to him, lest he die.

Oh...

That sounds like the meanest thing I've ever heard.

Huh?

Well, aye, it was a bit mean, but... he'll be fine once he gets home and he finds his daddy hasn't been hit by a bread van.

I used to think you were the nicest of them.

Turns out you're just the same as them.

I am the nicest of them.

Ar, Dominic, now!

Well, maybe I'm not a happy lad, so!

Maybe this is the new me!

Aye.

Maybe this is the new me.

Howdo!

Jesus Christ, Dominic!

Would you ever stop creeping up on people?

You almost gave me a fecking heart attack!

I wasn't creeping up on ya.

I was sidling up on ya.

Between you and that ghoul, Jesus!

I always call her a ghoul, too, because she is a ghoul.

Jeez, we have a lot in common, don't we?

Me and you.

Calling old people ghouls and that.

It's a great old lake, isn't it?

I'm glad I caught you, actually.

Because there was somethin' I was wantin' to ask ya, actually.

And discovering how much we have in common, well, it just makes me want to ask you even more.

We don't have anything in common.

Uh, don't skip ahead.

But yeah, what I was wantin' to ask you was...

Somethin' along the lines of...

Should've planned this, really.

Well, yeah, what I was wantin' to ask you was...

You probably wouldn't ever want to, I don't know, to fall in love with a boy like me, would ya?

Oh, Dominic, I don't think so, love.

No, yeah, no.

Uh, I was thinking no.

Not even in the future, like?

Like when I'm your age?

Yeah, no, I didn't think so.

Just thought I'd ask on the off chance, you know, like, "faint heart" and that.

Well, there goes that dream.

Well,

I best go over there and do whatever that thing over there I was gonna do was.

Mm-hmm.

Come on, Sammy, you have to dance too.

How are you, fatty?

Dancing with your dog, is it?

Well, who else is gonna dance with ya?

Your poor dog has no say in the matter.

And if you're too rude to be offering me a seat,

I'll be taking one of me own accord!

Now, how's that for an old hello?

Have you gone fecking mental?

Have I gone fecking mental?

No, I haven't gone fecking mental, actually.

Not only have I not gone fecking mental, but I have ten fingers to prove

I've not gone fecking mental.

How many fingers do you have to prove you've not gone fecking mental?

Nine fingers.

And nine fingers is the epitome of mental.

That's right. The epitome!

Heh. There'll be none of that!

I didn't come here for licks!

I came here for the opposite of licks.

What's the opposite of licks?

Huh?

What did you come here for?

I didn't come here for anythin', did I?

I just came to kick your door in and give you a slagging.

Well, you've done that, so you can go now.

Haven't finished yet, have I?

Well, I finished with your door.

I haven't finished with your slagging.

We were doin' so well, Padraic.

I wasn't doing so well.

I was doing terrible.

All right, I was doin' so well.

Yeah, well, it can't all be you, you, you, can it?

Yes, it can.

There's two of us in this. No, there isn't.

It takes two to tango.

I don't want to tango.

Well, you danced with your dog.

Talkin' of tangos, how's your new tune comin' along?

I just finished it, actually.

Just this morning.

No, Colm, that's great, like!

That's why I was dancing with me dog.

I don't usually dance with me dog.

There's no harm dancin' with your dog.

I'd dance with me donkey if I knew how. And she did.

Is it good?

Your tune?

Mm, what's it called?

"The Banshees of Inisherin,"

I was thinking.

But there are no banshees on Inisherin.

I know, I just like the double S-H sounds.

Aye.

There's plenty of double S-H on Inisherin.

Yeah.

Maybe there are banshees, too.

I just don't think that they scream to portend death anymore.

I think they just sit back, amused, and observe.

Portend?

Yeah.

I keep having thoughts about playing it for you at your funeral.

But that wouldn't be fair on either of us, would it?

Well, that's great that you finished your tune, Colm.

That's more than great.

That's... really great.

So, do you want to meet me down the pub, Colm?

We could celebrate your tune, like.

Only if you'd like, like.

But I could run up ahead.

Order them in.

Why don't you do that, Padraic?

Why don't I run up... and order them?

Well, I will so.

Jeez, that went well!

And maybe on the way,

I can find that student friend of yours, that Declan fella!

I told him his daddy was dying, so he'd feck off home and leave us alone, but there's no need now!

Sure he could join us.

What are you sitting over there for when I'm over here?

Just thought I'd have a sit for meself, you know.

Wait for me friend.

Are you fecking joking me?

Your four-fingered friend?

I mean, are you fecking joking me?

No, I'm not fecking joking ya.

He just needed a bit of tough love was all.

Siobhan, do you want a sherry?

No.Righty-ho.

What are you doin'?

Me? Yes, you.

Nothing. Just drinkin'.

Not waitin'?Not waitin'.

Well, he is waitin', Siobhan.

He's waitin' for Colm Doherty.

I amn't waitin'.

He just told me he was waitin'.

Telltale!

Come home with me, Padraic.

I've somethin' to discuss with ya.

You've somethin' to discuss with me?

That sounds, uh...

I don't want to discuss somethin'.

Well, ya have to, 'cause I'm leavin'.

Leavin'?

Like leavin'?

Like... not staying?

Yeah.

But what about me?

What about you?

I'll have no friends at all left!

You'll have Dominic. Ah here!

And he's gone off me now, too.

What kind of a place is it when the village gom goes off ya?

And who's gonna do the cookin'?

Oh, that's your first question, isn't it?

"Who's gonna do the cookin'?"

Well, it wasn't me first question, was it?

"But what about me?" was me first question.

Padraic.

Padraic!

Now?

But you can't be leavin' now!

I can be leavin' now.

I can't be waitin' round for any more of this madness!

What the hell did you say to him, Padraic?

Nothin' really.

Well, I'd sort of had a chat with Dominic earlier.

And a new sort of, you know, standin' up for meself sort of tack we thought I should try.

God!

It was all going fine until he chopped off all his fingers.

Me books wouldn't fit.

Would you look after them for me?

Ar, don't go, Siobhan.

They're all I have, really.

Apart from the obvious.

You'll be back soon, won't you, Siobhan?

Oh, Padraic!

Don't say, "Oh, Padraic."

Say yes.

Ah, Jenny.

Oh.

I don't want to talk.

Don't go killin' his dog now.

And don't be puttin' things in me head that weren't there in the first feckin' place, you feckin' nutbag!

"Nutbag!"

What would I ever hurt you for?

You're the only nice thing about him.

How are you, Padraic?

You're lookin' well.

That's lovely, lads.

I don't need your apologies, all right?

It's a relief to me.

So, let's just call it quits and agree to go our separate ways, for good this time.

Your fat fingers killed me little donkey today.

So, no, we won't call it quits.

We'll call it the start.

You're jokin' me.Yeah, no.

I'm not jokin' ya.

So tomorrow, Sunday,

God's day, around 2:00,

I'm going to call up to your house and I'm gonna set fire to it, and hopefully you'll still be inside it.

But I won't be checkin' either way.

Just be sure and leave your dog outside.

I've nothing against that gom.

Or you can do whatever's in your power to stop me.

To our graves we're taking this.

To one of our graves, anyways.

Here.

I've a bone to pick with you, dreary.

Is that little gobshite of mine at your place again?

Leave him, Peadar.

His donkey's just died.

Did he?

The little miniature fella?

Well, Jesus, boys,

I'll tell ya this much...

Two o'clock.

I killed a miniature donkey.

It was by accident... but I do feel bad about it.

Do you think God gives a damn about miniature donkeys, Colm?

I fear he doesn't.

And I fear that's where it's all gone wrong.

Is that it?

Is what it?

Aren't you forgetting a couple of things?

No, I think I've covered it.

Wouldn't you say punching a policeman is a sin?

Ah here.

If punching a policeman is a sin, we may as well just pack up and go home.

And self-mutilation is a sin.

It's one of the biggest.

Is it?

Self-mutilation, so you have me there.

Multiplied by five.

How's the despair?

It's back a bit.

But you're not gonna do anything about it?

I'm not gonna do anything about it, no.

Dear Padraic,

I am safely ensconced in the mainland and, Padraic, it's lovely here.

There's a river running past my window as I write, and the people already seem less bitter and mental.

I'm not sure why, but I think it's

'cause a lot of them are from Spain.

Mostly, I wanted to say there's a spare bed here for you, Padraic.

And with the war almost over, I think there'd be work for ya here.

Because there's nothing for you on Inisherin.

Nothing but more bleakness and grudges and loneliness and spite and the slow passing of time until death.

And sure, you can do that anywhere.

So come, Padraic. Leave there.

Dominic can look after Jenny and the rest of your animals.

They could move into the house together.

Hut!

So come now, Padraic, please.

Before it's all too late.

Dear Siobhan.

Obviously, I don't know what "ensconced" is, but I thank you for the offer of the free bed and the whatnot.

But I won't be takin' you up on it, I'm afraid.

As I told you, me life is on Inisherin.

Me friends, me animals.

Even now as I write, little donkey Jenny is looking at me, saying,

"Please don't go, Padraic.

We'd miss ya."

And nuzzling me, the gilly-gooly.

Get off, Jenny.

MRS. McCORMICK: Psst!

In other news, in sadder news, actually,

I won't be able to ask Dominic anything, I'm afraid.

Because they found him in the lake this morning.

I suppose he must've slipped and fell in.

So, there'd be no one to take care of the animals, anyway.

No other news, really.

Except that I love you, Siobhan.

And I miss ya.

And I hope I'll see ya again someday.

If you ever come back home.

Come back home, Siobhan.

Yours sincerely, your loving brother...

Padraic Suilleabhain.

Suppose me house makes us quits.

If you'd stayed in your house, that would've made us quits.

But you didn't, did ya, so it doesn't, does it?

I'm sorry about your donkey, Padraic.

Honestly, I am.

I don't fucking care.

Haven't heard any rifle fire from the mainland in a day or two.

I think they're coming to the end of it.

I'm sure they'll be at it again soon enough, aren't you?

Some things there's no movin' on from.

And I think that's a good thing.

Padraic.

Thanks for lookin' after me dog for me, anyways.

Any time.



# The Last Black Man in San Francisco

Jasmine?

Jasmine! We gonna be late. Come on.

Let's go.

Why do they have on these suits and we don't?

Something's going on right in our face.

Y'all so stuck in those iPhones,

J-Phone 12s or whatever.

Blow up in your hand.

You can't Google what's going on right now!

Are y'all paying attention?

Why do they have on these suits if we don't?

Why?

They here to clean this water?

When this water been dirtier than the devil's mouth for 50 years.

And now they want to clean it?

They got plans for us, man.

Looking like George Jetson rejects.

'Cause they weak!

Weak hearts! Weak lungs!

Can't even breathe up here without a mask.

But we was put through hell to be purified.

You know what I'm sayin', brothers and sisters?

Man, it's crazy what jail will do to a nigga.

They don't care about they water, man.

There's something going on.

We gonna get to the bottom of it.

And they lucky I'm a man of God right now!

You think he rehearses this every morning?

Or they would catch these hands.

Seems a bit more impromptu.

2019 out here!

We been yellin' about this water since before they were born.

Before they were born!

Where's this bus, man?

We're not gonna make it.

Y'all leave us the hell alone.

Unless y'all really here to help us.

We'll get there.

They got plans for us, man.

- We're not gonna make it, bro.

- Not for you and me.

So I urge you! Fight for your land!

Fight for your home!

- Fight for your...

- Let's skate.

This here?

This is the edge, bro!

The final frontier of Manifest Destiny.

Last edge of the city.

Man, two steps further, you'll be drinking that filthy saltwater.

But we built these ships, dredged these canals, in the San Francisco they never knew existed.

And now they come to build something new?

Whole blocks half in the past, half in the future.

But should you venture into their San Francisco, the one they pillaged for gold!

Remember your truth!

In the city of facades.

Take me with you! Hey! Hey!

Take me with you, man!

Come on, where are we going?

Where are we going?

Come on, I'm coming! I'm coming!

Look at them look at you.

Look down at you.

But we built them!

We are these homes!

Their eyes...

their pointed brims.

We move if they move.

Our sweat soaked in the wood.

Gilded in our image.

This is our home!

Our home!

Our home.

Thanks.

Are you sure they're gone?

Jim?

I mean, their car is gone.

Let's check the back, man.

Good morning. How are you?

Remember that time they were in the kitchen?

Jim!

Remember the kitchen?

Yeah, sure.

But, bruh.

Didn't I tell you these railings are periwinkle, not black.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah, I got it.

We gotta start coming more than every two weeks, bro.

This fuckin' garden's a nightmare.

- I'll bring my grandpa's tools next time.

- Please do.

Wallpaper's chipping.

These people are killing this house.

You're not goin' in, though, Jim.

I mean...

I mean... no.

They're definitely gone, though.

Better be quick this time. Hmm?

Yeah, I know.

Takes time.

Yeah, I know.

- I'll be at my spot.

- All right.

Quick.

Okay.

- Jesus, man!

- Honey.

Just get the heck out of here, man.

- What the fuck?

- He's not hurting anyone, Mar.

He's painting the house now?

- Well, yeah.

- Stop fixing my house!

I'm almost done. Just hold on.

Why don't you just paint the neighbors' houses?

- Theirs are worse than ours.

- Just hold on one second.

I mean, we appreciate it, in some way, but, yeah.

It's weird, man.

I'm almost done.

Look, we will call the cops, man.

And I mean it this time.

No, we're not gonna call the cops.

We're not calling the cops.

Just stop coming back.

I'm almost done. Hold on. Please, hold on.

Ugh! Just get off my fucking birdie bath.

Ugh! Get outta here, man.

- Those were $3.

- Fine.

I'll finish it next time. God!

Next time? Oh, just get...

Get the heck off my birdie bath!

Just water the plants in the back or I will.

Oh!

Bro!

You were supposed to be the lookout.

Mm-hmm.

You were the one that was so worried.

I got distracted.

Bro!

What if OG is right, though?

You really gotta stop eating the fish out there.

I think it's fine.

All fish has mercury.

I know, but I saw a seagull with a dick, bro.

Well, so I guess it's a male.

No, bro, like a human dick.

Oh, nasty-ass tumble-weave. Pussy.

- Wild, bro.

- Wassup, nigga?

Ain't tryin' do nothin'.

I ain't tryin' do that bullshit...

- Stop playin' before I slap your face.

- Man, shut your ass up, nigga.

I ain't finna chase you.

You play too much, bro.

You lucky I don't beat your ass out here, bro.

- Kofi! What's good, brother?

- What's up with y'all?

Hey, you know I seen Moms last night, right?

She was looking like she was missing a little bit on the top.

I mean, we shower in the same water, Jim.

So, niggas takin' showers together now?

Probably was.

That's fruity.

I was trying to tell him not to eat the fish because the water is toxic.

Well, duh. That's 'cause they built the atomic bomb right there, nigga.

I don't think that's true.

What'd he say?

- Damn.

- Breath stink. That's true.

Bro, them shoes ain't true.

I know your Jesus-lookin' ass ain't talkin', bro.

- Them things is phony.

- They're definitely phony.

- What about cuz, man?

- Oh, yeah, dude is a cat.

You see his hair, he might be a cheetah.

Can I help you?

I'd like to see the man in charge.

In here.

He's walking him into the Chief's office.

Oh, dear.

I want to report a murder.

Now, who's that?

Edgar O'Ryan.

Where was this murder committed?

- Edmund O'Brien.

- San Francisco.

- That's right.

- Oh. Oh, him, yeah, yeah.

Who was murdered?

I was.

What?

- How?

- Just watch it.

Hey, hand me my beer, Son.

- Yes, sir.

- Yeah.

Yeah, okay.

O'Brien is smoking a cigarette

- in his office.

- Okay, yeah.

- Secretary's perched.

- She pretty?

Mmm.

- Yeah?

- I'd say she is.

You dog.

Hey, Mont!

- Montgomery!

- Hmm?

How do I get their old croissant-throwing asses out of the house?

What if I peed on their table?

Like, what if I climbed up the birdie bath, broke in and just peed all over that stupid little yellow table?

Wouldn't that ruin the floors?

Yeah, I guess you got a point there.

Oh.

You think they'd let me live there as, like, a caretaker for the house?

No.

That's fucked up.

I mean, I take pretty good care of the house.

I think so at least.

Yeah, you do.

We like having you here, Jim.

I know, bro.

But... you know there's no place like home.

Yeah.

Good night, Dorothy.

Yeah, you got it, though.

Hmm. Yeah, man.

Y'all been here 12 years, still can't take care of this house.

Hey, Paul.

Hey!

I got you.

- Hi.

- Fuck you.

- Hey.

You're a nice man.

You're a nice woman.

But I don't know you.

Well, yeah.

You know me pretty well, actually.

But you aren't my husband.

You're a little too young for me.

I am young.

I'm always young.

You're a nice man.

Oh, thank you.

You're a nice woman.

You old marshmallow, cream puff-ass, candied yam-ass nigga, cream puff-ass nigga.

You bitch.

I should snatch your one-ass dread, lookin' like a fuckin' Rastafarian sperm.

You got me fucked up.

- We did!

That's all you gotta say?

What I'm supposed to do, take off?

I don't care about none of that shit.

I just ain't got nothin' else to say.

Man, I put that on a fact, that this nigga's a bitch, man.

- Is that sure, man.

- Fuck you, n...

Wassup, nigga?

'Sup, nigga?

'Sup, nigga?

How are you, nigga?

I hope she's not home.

That garden...

We have so much to do.

We have to rake it. We have to weed it.

- We have to...

- Jim.

Isn't that the car you used to live in?

Oh, God.

Jimmie!

What up, filth-smellin' motherfucker?

Do you need a ride?

Jimmie! What's happenin', baby?

Get your young, old-looking ass in the car.

Daddy face. Jimmie!

Oh, my God, where is this bus?

If you don't get your up the-father-from-

Good-Times shirt-wearing ass in this car...

You really gonna ride the bus with a shovel?

Get your farming ass in this car.

Jimmie the farmer with your bitch ass.

Come on. Laugh a little bit, Jimmie, shit.

Still the same.

Yep,

I like what you and your dad did with it.

So much you drove off with it?

No, I borrowed it.

I didn't just... Come on.

I drove off with it? I borrowed it. Shit.

Matter of fact,

I seen your dad the other day.

He was good and lonely.

By hisself.

Okay.

I told him,

"You need to get you a cat or a dog, or a woman or something, nigga, damn."

He's home alone.

Well, he ain't at home, but he's alone.

He's alone with no home.

Well, you live in a car by yourself.

Yeah, but I... But I'm not alone.

People like me.

I'm liked.

Lonely ass nigga.

When the last time you hung out with your daddy?

Couple weeks ago. I don't know.

Couple weeks ago?

The nigga needs you today.

Shit.

That's what...

That's what people have kids for, so they can have some companionship, somebody to hang out with.

That's why I ain't had no kids.

'Cause I don't wanna be bothered.

Your daddy don't want this fuckin' car, man.

- Hey.

- Hmm?

- Wasn't that the Savoy House?

- Oh, sure was.

It was 100 motherfuckers in there, rent-controlled.

They thought they owned that shit.

The landlord burned all of the people out of there.

'Cause, see, Jimmie, you never really own shit.

This car ain't mine.

But it never was yours.

You never own shit!

What the fuck?

Hey, what's goin' on, man?

No sé, bro.

Uh, sir?

What's-What's going on?

Oh, God.

She's moving.

Fighting like crazy with her sister.

When someone dies in the family, that's what white people do.

"This is for her, this is for him, this is mine."

Who's gonna have the house?

So they lost the house?

Who's gonna possess the house?

They're just fighting and fighting and fighting.

What's gonna happen to it now?

Why'd they have to move out

'cause her mom died?

I don't know.

They were... tasteless, but at least they didn't fuck it up.

Well, that will be 10 bucks, hun.

Since when?

Since that's the best deal you're gonna get on 60 Twix.

I didn't say 60 Twix, Auntie. I said 16.

How I'm gonna eat 60 Twix?

I don't know your life.

You act like you at Costco or something like that.

You ain't at Costco.

Hey, you can go to Costco if you need to.

- You Rosco.

- Go right now.

Sixteen. First time you had a check.

Jim. Jim.

Jim.

Jim?

So, gentlemen.

What can I do for you?

Yeah, we're curious about a house on Golden Gate near Fillmore.

- Mm-hmm.

- It's 959.

It's gray, it's got the gold trim.

- Uh, it's got...

- Yep, yep.

Yep, with the, um... the witch hat.

- Yeah, exactly.

- Yeah!

I know exactly what you're talking about.

- That place is very special.

- Hmm.

I used to drive past that house on my way to school every day.

- What school did you go to?

- I went to St. Ignatius.

You from here, too?

Yeah, third generation,

- I went to Reardon, actually.

- Really?

Yeah, we used to play y'all in football all the time.

- You used to kill us in football.

- Yeah, yeah.

I didn't wanna say that, but...

That's awesome, right on.

But, so, it's for sale?

I didn't hear about that.

Well, I'm not sure.

It seems like the owner and her sister are fighting over it.

But I guess her mom died.

Ah, man.

I don't know.

That sounds like an estate thing.

That's a sucky situation.

But, I mean...

With a house like that, they could be fighting over that for years.

While it just sits there.

It's a pity.

So it's really just... just empty?

It's fucked up, right?

So fucked up. Like, it bothers me.

There's all these people in the street, and these big old houses are just sitting there collecting dust.

But shit, what else can you say?

The fucking injustice of it.

Yeah.

Mont! We here, baby!

Spoiling all the fun, leveling most of this neighborhood in the name of Urban Renewal.

Sorry about your homes and your funky shops.

You can set up a shoeshine stand in front of the parking lot at Safeway.

But you distinguished truth-seekers want to know about the real hep cats who hung out here, in the "Harlem of the West," where a few of these homes did survive.

Like this beauty here, which was built clear back in the 1800s.

Before the black thing, this was all Japanese, till FDR's stormtroopers rounded them up into camps.

This house was built in the 1940s.

Say hi to our neighbor here, everybody.

Hi.

That would actually be about 100 years late for this style.

We can see from his gingerbread trim, this was built sometime in the 1850s.

Uh, 1946!

I'm gonna have to disagree with you there, dude man.

No architect in the 1940s was building in this style.

That's probably true, but this wasn't built by an architect.

My grandfather built this.

He came here in World War Il, he bought this lot, and he built this house.

The stairs. These windows.

The columns. The archways.

The witch hat.

The balustrades. The fish scales.

This balcony.

That wall to keep y'all the fuck out.

All of it.

By Jimmie Fails I, with his own two hands.

In 1946.

Wow.

That's pretty amazing.

Well... let's move on to our next stop.

The closet Patty Hearst willfully hid herself in before trotting on down...

What's good with that? What's going on?

Feel like the King of England.

King Jimmie. Wave.

Wave to the General.

- Hey, General.

- Yeah, but it's like a circle with your... with your elbow.

Yeah, and then cup the air.

That's "cup the air".

- Oh, yeah.

- Yeah, that's good.

It's a beautiful house, Jim.

More beautiful than I could have imagined.

Yeah.

It's not quite there yet.

I mean, they left Dickens.

Charles Dickens.

Philistines, bro.

Frost! Plath!

Hughes!

Jimmie! Langston Hughes! They left him!

Bro!

Philistines!

Mont.

Mont.

Wake up.

Got a plan.

It's crazy.

Last time I was here, these weeds was taller than me.

- She's expecting us?

- Yes, sir.

- Auntie!

- Jimmie!

Yes!

Oh! So good to see you!

- You look good!

- Thank you.

- Hey!

- This is Mont.

Nice to meet you. Oh.

Y'all not hot? Like, you want...

- It's hot as hell out here.

- Take your jacket off.

Ain't nobody gonna steal your jacket.

This is a nice neighborhood.

Man, he better not break my damn board.

Shut up. You should be thanking him.

He's the one that helped me pick out that board.

And besides... sometimes it's just nice to watch.

Mmm.

Ricky, do that trick you used to do, baby.

Nice, baby.

Y'all hella cute.

Aw, thank you.

So, how much of this stuff do you still have?

Really?

"How much of this stuff do you have?"

You just... No segue or nothin'?

You just came to see the stuff, huh?

Auntie, I got my first place.

Whoa.

Really?

- In the city?

- In the city.

Look at you!

Y'all must be doing pretty well to afford a spot there.

Yeah, we got lucky.

- Mm-hmm.

- It's super empty, though.

Your daddy didn't send you here, right?

- No.

- You sure?

I swear to God.

'Cause I hope he's done dragging you into his schemes.

Auntie, this is for us.

Okay.

Okay.

I'm proud of you, Jayboe.

- Really am.

- Thank you.

I miss that city.

Oh! Ooh!

You still look good, though, baby.

You still look good.

Mmm.

Oh, my goodness.

Mmm.

Damn, I knew you had some of it, but is this everything?

Everything your dad didn't smoke up.

Sorry. Came out a little harsh.

I'm fine.

You really got all of this.

Yep!

Got as much as I could.

Open that.

That's amazing.

Yeah, I knew that, out of everybody in this family, you would be the one to come looking for this stuff.

So...

I can...

Everything?

It's yours.

- Thank you.

- Hell, yeah.

Ricky, get the truck!

You guys good back there?

Bye. Thank you.

So, Ricky never lived in the house?

No, Wanda didn't meet him until after we lost it.

You gonna poop or not?

Hello.

- Hello, sir.

- Hey!

I'm Jimmie Fails.

We haven't had the chance to meet yet.

- Oh. Oh, yeah.

- Yeah.

Welcome to the neighborhood.

Yeah, oh, yes. Welcome.

Tim. Tim Ellory.

Sure, sure. Nice to meet you, man.

It's a fast-moving market.

I don't even remember a sign going up.

Oh, it didn't need to, but...

Look, Tim, I want you to know,

I'm gonna be the best damn neighbor you ever had.

Well... all right, Jimmie, thank you.

My pleasure.

Uh, well, you'll have to pardon me.

We've got lots to do, but...

- Of course, oh, yeah.

- Very nice to meet you, yeah.

What the fuck was that all about?

I wanna drink my coffee and scratch my ass while I read the paper.

You don't read the paper, Jimmie.

'Cause I never had a home to read it in.

Shit.

We could throw parties.

You could put on one of your plays.

We could yell.

- The neighbors, Jimmie.

- Oh, the neighbors?

- Hmm.

- I got neighbors now.

I know his daddy mad as hell. Mm-mm-mm.

You still skateboarding?

Nah.

Hmm.

What?

Come here, help me cut these out.

And make sure the color bleeds all the way through.

No white edges, all right?

Yes, sir. Same as always.

Yeah.

Same as always.

Hey, you remember that, uh, warehouse we squatted at?

After we lived in the El Dorado?

We lost that 'cause we didn't pay taxes, right?

Hell nah.

I paid our fair share of tax on that.

But who cares? Old drafty-ass roach nest.

Shit, it was that, or sleeping on the street with your little ass.

Well, I appreciate it, Dad.

Mm-hmm.

So, say I'm at a place now, and the owners left it.

I'm gonna pay taxes on it.

You put gas and electric in your name?

Right, I'm gonna do that next.

You know I know.

Okay, doin' it like your old man.

That's good.

And nobody's come to check on it?

Nope. It's empty.

Good. That buys you time.

And they been gone three years?

Nah, just recently.

Wait, what?

You were workin' on it while they were still in it?

Yeah.

Where is this house?

It's the house in Fillmore.

Wow.

Our old house.

What the fuck you mean, our old house?

Have you seen that house?

Well, yeah. I mean,

I be over there all the time.

Then you know that's not your old house and that's not your black-ass neighborhood.

Little disrespectful lyin' ass.

- What are you talking about?

- Nigga, I know you skateboard!

Yeah. Yeah, I see all that shit out there.

Everybody's little path.

I'm, like, 30 steps ahead of y'all.

Go on. Get!

You know we don't talk about that house no more.

Put the shit down and go!

Hey, you been waiting here long?

It's cool, right?

Yeah, man.

Did you see him today?

How'd it go?

He said this was a bad idea.

Thought you said he was an idiot.

Nah, he's just mad

'cause he lost the house.

But what if we shouldn't be here?

Who should be here more?

Hmm?

Some millionaire?

They'd want it 'cause it looks nice.

You're the reason it looks nice, Jim.

I don't know.

What the fuck?

I invited somebody.

What's good, nigga?

Glad you could make it.

What's goin' on?

Be back in a sec. Pardon me.

Y'all got an organ?

Columns and shit.

It's just y'all here?

Yeah.

It just makes noises.

Oh, okay.

It's nice to see you in that chair.

I didn't know you'd pick that one.

Thanks a lot, bro.

Kinda awkward, but this place is cool.

Yeah.

Jimmie's been doing a lot to fix it up.

How'd y'all get this?

It's Jimmie's.

His grandpa built it.

He was the first black man in San Francisco.

That's what they call him anyways.

Oh, shit.

- This that house?

- Hmm.

Hey, Jimmie used to talk about this spot all the time.

But you know how niggas be in the group home.

Overexaggerating and shit.

Trying to be all special.

You weren't lying about this one, though, huh, Jimmie?

You were in a group home?

Yeah.

For, like, a year.

Yep.

You guys wanna go for a schvitz?

A what?

Wait, your grandfather made this, too?

Nah. Nah, these white people did.

Uh-huh.

Well, how you know he was the first one, though?

This nigga be lyin'.

Bro, he came over here from New Orleans.

There was hella Japanese people, bro.

And then they got thrown into little war camps, and he wasn't tryin' to move into nobody else's shit.

So he built this, bro.

This is great.

You still skate, bro?

Nah.

No, I don't skate no more.

Oh, shit, I mean, you used to be hella raw.

Yeah.

Not no more.

Hey, you remember Gunna?

Remember when he got caught stealing from the candy lady?

Yeah, he's an ugly-ass crier.

Oh, man.

Hurt as fuck!

Hey, remember, uh, Miss Homer, the one that ran the group home?

- Oh, yeah!

- And she cut that nigga hair.

Had his line crooked hella much!

"Know damn well that white lady couldn't cut no hair!"

Had that nigga's shit lookin' like Lombard.

That nigga said Lomb...

Ah, man, you niggas gonna make me piss on myself.

Oh, shit, y'all got a bathroom up in here, man?

- In this big-ass house?

- It's down the hall.

It's the room with the little claw-foot tub.

All right.

This cool as shit, big-ass house.

Man...

I wish I had a grandpa like you.

Leave me some shit like this.

This shit's enjoyable.

Right on, bro.

I'm proud of you niggas. You too, Mont.

Crazy-ass.

Just living the life, man.

Y'all niggas really done made it, man.

Ah, shit, I'm gonna go use this bathroom real quick.

You a funny motherfucker, Jimmie.

"You a funny motherfucker, Jimmie."

You should, uh...

You should have your own room, bro.

That's okay, Jim.

Nah, seriously, man.

I been in your space forever.

This place is yours, too.

Any room?

How about this one?

Are you sure you want the dining room?

Yeah.

It's perfect.

Dream big, bro.

It's yours.

Um, yeah, we're gonna have to figure something out.

I don't have that much time.

It's a complicated situation.

No, the power's been on.

I just need the bill in my name.

Uh-huh.

Okay, great.

Well, when will I get the first invoice?

And you can't mail that any sooner?

All right, yeah.

He's talking about paying some bills.

'Cause I wouldn't say no if he offered to chip in a little more.

He already pays half, Grandpa.

Well, he's been here for a while, you know?

And he is not exactly family.

I think he knows that.

Let's hope so.

What's all this noise up in here?

I'm just packing some stuff.

It's for a project.

Since when?

I mean, we haven't even talked about the characters yet.

- You know how much I like that.

- Yeah, well, I'm still working on it.

Don't quite have a plot yet.

Well, we can brainstorm a little bit.

You know, that's where I think we the best at.

When we brainstorming.

I think I gotta brainstorm this one by myself right now.

But I'd love to talk about it soon.

You about ready, bro?

Mm-hmm.

Well, um... whatever it is, uh...

I'm proud of you.

- Wow, look at him.

- What type of shoes are those?

Yeah, you should start rocking like that, bra-bra.

What the fuck is up with your hat, Jimmie?

You look like a human cigarette.

I can't handle it.

Jimmie, is that a bowling ball?

It's the black Alice in Wonderland.

Hey, Monty, I heard you be whippin' out that little weenie on all the girls.

Bro, with that hair, you look like a Simpson.

Nigga, shut up, bro, your one-shirt-havin' ass.

Jimmie, you wear the same shirt every motherfuckin' day.

You look like a fiend, Jimmie. Come on!

Hey, just like your daddy!

I remember your crackhead-ass daddy.

And your dope-fiend-ass mom.

Family of fiends, dawg.

I done sold him a rock back in the day.

Hey, what you got up in there?

Some lace curtains for that whole beautifyin'-ass house that y'all been makin' up and shit?

Okay, Kofi! Okay, what else?

These niggas the other day, they pulled up the other day.

Niggas had all types of feminine shit goin' on in that house, bro.

Jimmie, what two men do that?

Just 'cause you in that big-ass house, you not better than us, Jimmie.

- Never.

- You're not better than us.

Hey, what is those, lace curtains you gonna beautify the house with?

Come on, man, soft-ass nigga.

I know who you is, Jimmie. Remember!

Hey, you know what y'all need to do?

Y'all need to disappear like a motherfuckin' magic trick, nigga!

Rabbit out the hat. Get the fuck out here.

Fuck outta here!

Jimmie! Jimmie! Go home!

You're really drawing them?

They just talk shit.

Well, you talked shit when I met you.

I did?

You did.

It's fine, though.

Why'd you hang out with me, then?

You care about things. I liked you.

You really don't give a fuck what anybody says?

I shouldn't get to appreciate them

'cause they're mean to me?

That's silly.

Oh.

What are you doing here?

What are you ever doing here?

Uh... didn't you move out, though?

Yeah.

They changed the fuckin' locks on me.

I'm sorry. That sucks.

What do you want, man?

How long you gonna be here?

I don't know yet. I'm just tryin' to... let go.

Okay, well...

I guess we'll just come back tomorrow, then.

Great.

That's nice.

Come on, Jim.

We'll go to my house.

In this crazy fuckin' city, you're still here.

Man, those damn kids dropping bubble gum all over the place.

It'll get all over your seat, man.

You know what I'm sayin'?

Think she'll stay there all night?

Watch, we'll come back and she'll be painting the windowsill.

Yes, baby. Yes, I will be there.

You know, come check it out.

Oh, that's nice. Yeah.

The house, my dad's old house.

- Oh, your family house on Golden Gate?

- Yeah.

Okay. Well, I got your number.

I'll call you.

Try to come over there tomorrow.

Oh, I don't have a phone.

Well, I just have to come over there, then.

What's the best time to come?

I'll be over there tomorrow.

Well, yeah, whenever.

Come... Yeah.

Tomorrow, yeah. Fuck it.

Okay. Cool, I'll be there tomorrow.

Okay.

Yeah. Well... our stop's coming up, but... uh, It was really nice to see you, Mom.

Well, it was good to see you too, Son, okay?

- Yeah.

- All right.

- All right.

- All right. Bye, now.

Okay. Oh, my God. You taller than me now.

- Yeah, uh...

- Okay, bye, Son.

Yeah, bye. Uh...

Why? Why?

What happened?

Why?

What the fuck?

What happened?

- What the fuck happened?

- He got shot.

They shot him.

Who? Who shot him?

Who?

Bay niggas.

For what?

For what?

He was talking shit to the wrong niggas.

Tried to bluff some niggas out.

Tried to bluff them out?

Man, what's with all the questions, bro?

I just don't get it.

I just fuckin' seen y'all.

- And, nigga?

- And I don't fucking get it!

Man.

Get the fuck up outta here, bro.

Me get the fuck outta here?

- Yes, nigga, go!

- It's your fucking fault!

That's my fuckin' friend, too!

- All right, nigga.

- Get on this nigga!

All right.

Push up on this nigga, bro.

You finna let him say that?

That poor boy and his friends.

I'm sorry, Jimmie.

I hope I never made you feel like you weren't welcome here.

No, I... I never felt like that.

'Cause I don't care where you been.

You don't have to tell me.

It's just, you two... stick together.

You know, I was writing a play about him.

You don't have to stop now.

"You a funny motherfucker, Jimmie."

I know it sounds weird, but...

I kinda feel like that could've been me.

If not for the house.

Man, I wanna go home.

Filthy, fishy salt water.

Water been funkier than the devil's mouth for 50 years.

Now they wanna clean it up.

They've got plans for us.

We was made to be put through hell.

Purified. We was made to be put through hell.

Be purified.

Fuck!

Oh, God.

Fuck!

How did she toss all of our shit?

I don't think it was her.

Fuckin' traitor.

Okay.

Can you stay here and watch the shit?

Yeah, where you going?

- Where you going?

- I'll be back.

I'll be back.

Jimmie!

Sorry, uh, how can I help you today?

Uh...

- I want to buy a house.

- A house?

That's exciting.

Uh, are you working with an agent?

No. Do I need to?

No.

Not necessarily. Um... do you have a price range in mind?

I have a house in mind.

Oh.

Um... it's on the market, I assume?

How much are they asking?

At least four million.

Uh, and how much are you willing to put down?

How much is usual?

Well, typically, we'd be looking to secure at least 20%.

I wouldn't have that.

That's understandable.

It's going to be hard to land a place like that.

But suppose I ask instead, uh...

No, no, look.

I get it.

I'm young. Uh, I'm black.

I'm not rich.

I came here knowing all that.

But let's be real.

You also got a quota to meet.

- Now, I'm not calling you a predator.

- Sir.

But you're trying to make your money.

- So let me help you do that.

- Sir, that's not the way this works.

You can give me whatever deal you gotta give me. I don't care what it is.

'Cause unlike all the other people that default, this is the only house I'll ever want.

So I'll never miss a monthly bill, ever.

You can give me your highest interest rate.

You can give me your highest interest rate, okay?

- Fuck me.

- No, I completely...

You don't even have to feel bad.

You don't even have to feel bad.

Okay? I will pay back every single cent.

I'm sorry, sir.

I will pay back every single cent.

Okay, okay, you win!

Okay, yep, it's yours.

You charming bastard. Okay.

Talk to you soon. Bye-bye.

- How's it going, man?

- Fine, sir.

I noticed the house we discussed is now for sale.

There are some alarming elements in your literature

I thought you would like to know.

And certainly the Bureau of Real Estate would.

Uh-huh.

This claims the property has a view of the Golden Gate.

Which... I don't think is true.

Well, it isn't. It isn't true.

It also claims to have all the original fixtures, floors, and faucets.

Isn't true.

And are you planning on disclosing that there's no septic tank?

Which means, any day now, the garden could be flooded... with shit.

Where's this going, man?

Well... all this together seems like false advertisement.

Which is grounds for void of sale.

Potential revoke of license.

I thought it might've been you guys.

What's your deal, man?

Don't have a deal.

Hmm. Look... somebody on this floor would've gotten that house if it wasn't me.

At least I'm from here, right?

I put your stuff on the street as a favor.

- Okay.

- I could've had it trucked away, but I left it out for you.

Look, dick wad.

I'm not fucking around. I will report you.

For what? Listing a view of the bridge?

And fixtures?

Everybody does that.

I literally copy-pasted that shit.

Well, you're lying about the history of the house.

- I'm not lying about that.

- Yes, you are!

You say it was built 100 years earlier than it actually was.

Look, I'm not making this up.

Yes, you are!

James Fails built this house in 1946.

- James?

- Fails!

What are you talking about?

Look, man.

Deed of Trust, 1857.

Architect Gil-hoo-ley, some shit.

Your guy Fails lost it in the '90s.

See? Right there.

Look, man. If you need a week to find somewhere else, then take it.

But... don't go pulling some squatters rights shit on me, man.

I got your mail.

I know your name.

I don't want to call the cops.

I don't want to do that to you.

Where'd you go?

Doesn't matter, bro.

I got everything inside. Except the couch.

That shit almost fell on me.

Jim...

I spoke to the Realtor.

Yeah, fuck that guy.

He's gonna throw us out.

And eventually call the cops.

I don't know how much longer we can keep doing this.

I understand if you can't.

I do.

But I'm not leaving.

- Jim, he said your grand...

- Where am I gonna go?

My dad's in the SRO.

My aunt's out in bum fuck.

My mom...

Bro, I don't even know where my mom is.

I'm not leaving, bro.

I'm the last one left.

We have my house.

I can't go back there, bro.

Mont, this house...

This is what I do.

Hey, it's what we do, Mont.

This is our shit.

We can't give up now.

We gotta fight.

Right?

Yeah.

I'm with you, bro.

You always been with me.

Oh, shit, you're writing?

Yeah. Uh... I think I cracked a play.

I'd like to put it on next week, if that's all right.

Hell, yeah, get it, bro.

Oh, no.

Very good. Very good.

So, this is gonna be interesting.

This is nice.

- Nice crowd, too.

- Yeah.

You make a lot of money on candy?

Sell candy?

- I used to, for years.

- Oh, yeah?

Most of these new white people moving in these black neighborhoods, they don't even know they standing in the kitchen where a dude got shot at.

Hmm.

I didn't know he was doing a play and shit.

He just invited us,

I don't know what weird shit they got goin' on, but it's pretty weird.

What I'm-a hit you for?

You my folks.

All right.

All right.

But I can't have soft niggas hanging around me.

Hit me.

Nah!

Nah! For what, nigga?

Hit me.

Man up, nigga. Man up!

No, bro! No! No, bro, no!

Oh, you soft.

You soft, nigga.

They gonna call you a bitch at your funeral.

I ain't no bitch!

I ain't no bitch! I'm a man!

Then hit me.

Hit me, bro. Hit me.

Hit me, nigga.

All right! All right!

Yeah! Here, nigga. I don't give a fuck.

Come see me, nigga.

Who out there hiding, hmm?

Man up! Man up, nigga!

Make sure you like the post.

Ro-Ro-Ro-Rodney Tuck.

Mr. Tuck moved to Florida ten years ago!

Are these the people who knew Kofi?

Kofi had dimensions.

More than a... a post could reflect or a play could capture.

So I summon you.

Celebrate the life he lived.

Not through those who speak the loudest.

But through the memories he left us all.

Ma'am!

- Me?

- Hmm. How will you...

How will you remember Kofi?

Um...

Um... he, you know, he used to come and walk my niece home from school when she first moved up here.

He was a little gentleman, or whatnot, you know, sweet, um...

It's just sad.

Mmm.

- I coached Kofi in Pop Warner.

- Mm-hmm.

He stayed behind and helped me pack up every day.

Yeah.

And how about you, young man?

Shit, man.

I don't know.

Did I push him too hard?

Kofi was my nigga, man.

Did I push him too hard?

Bro.

Hmm. How about you?

Well... my last memory of Kofi was him talking shit to me.

He said some of the most fucked-up shit anybody's ever said to me.

But Kofi also got jumped for defending me against the older kids in the group home.

He didn't like to fight, but... he fought for me then.

People aren't one thing.

That.

All...

All of it.

What would have happened... if Kofi could've... showed himself?

All forms of himself.

The world... put him in a box!

And he never... pushed beyond it.

Let us.

Let us break the boxes!

Let us give each other the courage to-to see!

Beyond the stories we are born into!

Let us all really look at Jimmie Fails IV.

Self-taught historian.

Carpenter.

Gentle, loving man.

A true survivor. Jimmie!

How many places have you lived?

And if they kicked you out tomorrow, you would still be all those things!

You exist beyond the... these walls.

You extend beyond your... your forefathers!

You're not this house!

Jimmie, you are not these... these walls!

You're not these floors, you're not this ceiling!

- It's time you know!

- Bro, what are you doing?

- What are you doing?

- It is time!

- It is time you know!

- I don't need to know.

I don't need to know.

Let's stop. Let's stop.

- Jimmie, you don't need...

- Enough, stop!

- Please, stop. Mont!

- Jimmie!

- Your grandpa didn't build this house!

- Enough!

He didn't build it, Jimmie!

Yes, he did.

He built this house!

He didn't. I saw it, man. I saw the deed.

I saw it.

I don't know what the hell that thing was.

Then he shoots a left. Psh!

Ha!

Man, let 'em leave.

They don't deserve to be in here anyway.

Neither do we.

You gonna really let some old-ass nigga tell you what's true?

Come on, Jayboe.

Get your spine up, Son.

- Have some pride, man.

- I've been doin'.

But you say it.

Say what?

The truth.

What?

That grandpa didn't build this house.

Man, get outta here with that bullshit.

Come on, Jayboe.

Just say it.

Can't tell you shit.

I'm outta here, man.

You sit in that bullshit if you want.

Jayboe.

I been telling people he built it for so long.

Almost forgot it wasn't true.

This was ours.

And then it wasn't.

So you just tell yourself what you need to make you feel like it still is.

Shit.

I did it, too.

It makes you feel... special.

But you got a chance to get out from underneath all of that now.

I don't want to.

I just want it.

Is that what you really want?

To spend the rest of your life working for this?

Fighting for this?

I believe that you could make this place yours.

I really do.

But if you leave... it's not your loss.

It's San Francisco's.

Fuck San Francisco.

- This city blows.

- Big time.

I mean, whatever.

I'm not above living in a former crack house, you know?

But I came here for Janis and the Airplane, not to work at a fucking start-up.

Dude, I've been saying for months, let's just move to East LA.

This city's dead.

Yeah.

Seriously, fuck this city.

Excuse me?

You don't get to hate San Francisco.

I'm sorry, what?

Yeah, dude, I mean, sorry, but I'll hate what I want.

Do you love it?

It's... I mean, yeah, I'm here.

But do I have to love it?

You don't get to hate it unless you love it.

Classic Muni shit.

Who call the money man?

Come on now, hurry up.

Pay attention!

Alexander the Great was a black man.

They don't teach you that in the devil school system.

I can't take another day of this bullshit.

Oh, Jim.

I'm sorry I did that.

It was a stupid play.

Nah.

I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth.

I just wanted it to be true.

It felt so good, you know?

It's okay.

Hey, Jimmie. Are you hungry?

Fucking starving.

He's giving up.

I can't take no more.

- He's breaking down.

- Oh, wow.

He's really tearing this apartment apart.

This looks exciting, though, you know?

- Yeah. Yeah, it is.

- Yeah? Oh, yeah?

- Oh! I got it now.

- Oh!

He seems like he's horny or something.

He's banging on the door again.

# Benediction     

 The audience

pricks an intellectual ear.

Stravinsky quite the concert of the year.

Forgetting now the hullabaloo they made,

the audience pricks an intellectual ear.

Bassoons begin,

sonority envelopes our auditory innocence,

and brings to me,

I must admit,

some drift of things omnific, seminal, and adolescent.

Men in boaters, far from Henley,

girls in pink and blue taffeta.

In that long summer,

I hunted, played cricket, but only watched tennis.

God was in His heaven

{\an8}and there were sausages for breakfast.

And in small recruiting offices,

dull young men wait to inscribe in paper quires,

the names of the living and the dead.

Mr Sassoon.

Yes.

I'm Siegfried.

And I'm Hamo, younger brother.

And we've both come for our fitting.

Just so, sir.

I think we should start with the shirts.

You can't have your shirts too dark, sir.

Ah, war! A la mode!

 I never said goodbye to him.

On the idle hill of summer,

sleepy with the flow of streams,

far I hear the steady drummer,

drumming like a noise in dreams.

Far and near and low and louder,

on the roads of Earth go by,

dear to friends and food for powder,

soldiers marching, all to die.

East and west in fields forgotten

bleach the bones of comrades slain.

Lovely lads and dead and rotten.

None that go return again.

Far the calling bugles hollo,

high the screaming fife replies.

Gay the files of scarlet follow:

Woman bore me, I will rise.

I was anxious to know what you were suffering from.

It's only trench fever, nothing fatal, just debilitating.

I dread everything now.

The telephone... the telegram.

There's only one thing worse than remaining in the past, Mother, and that's begrudging the future.

The future, without either of my sons, is to be dreaded, not enjoyed.

 I am writing you this private letter

with the greatest possible regret.

I must inform you that it is my intention

to refuse to perform any further military duties.

I am doing this as a protest

against the policy of the government

in prolonging the war

by failing to state their conditions for peace.

I have written a statement of my reasons,

of which I enclose a copy.

I am making this statement

as an act of wilful defiance of military authority

because I believe that the war

is being deliberately prolonged

by those who have the power to end it.

I am a soldier

convinced that I am acting on behalf of soldiers.

I believe that the war upon which I entered

as a war of defence and liberation

has now become a war of aggression and conquest.

I believe that the purpose for which I and my fellow soldiers

entered upon this war

should have been made so clearly stated

as to have made it impossible to change them.

And that had this been done, the objects that actuated us

would now be attainable by negotiation.

I have seen and endured the sufferings of the troops

and I can no longer be a party

to prolong these sufferings for ends

which I believe to be evil and unjust.

I am not protesting against the conduct of the war,

but against the political errors

and insincerities for which

the fighting men are being sacrificed.

On behalf of those who are suffering now,

I make this protest against the deception

which is being practised upon them.

Also, I believe it may help to destroy

the callous complacency

with which the majority of those at home

regard the continuance of agonies

which they do not share

and which they have not enough imagination to realize.

I suppose this was your doing.

Yes, and Eddie Marsh.

I take this very ill, Robbie.

Why did you involve Marsh?

Because he's Principal Private

Secretary to Winston Churchill and he wanted to help.

He was instrumental in getting you a Medical Board examination instead of a court martial.

If you were found guilty at a court martial, you could be shot.

That was a risk

I was prepared to take.

But there are those who care for you and who were not.

A court martial would have been a platform to state my opposition to the conduct of the war, and you have prevented me doing so.

And not only for this Times article but for my statement to be read out on the floor of the House.

You've rendered me impotent, Robbie.

You've robbed me of my dignity.

Better that than a firing squad.

That is a matter of opinion.

Don't be angry with me, Siegfried.

My intentions were honourable.

An old cowpoke went ridin' out

One dark and windy day

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way

When all at once, a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw

A-ploughing through the ragged skies

And up a cloudy draw

Yippee-yi-ay

Yippee-yi-oh

The ghost herd in the sky

Their brands were still on fire

And their hooves were made of steel

Their horns were black and shiny

And their hot breath he could feel

A bolt of fear went through him

As they thundered through the sky

For he saw the riders coming hard

And he heard their mournful cries

Yippee-yi-ay

Yippee-yi-oh

Ghost riders in the sky

As the riders loped on by him

He heard one call his name

If you wanna save your soul from hell

A-riding on our range

Then, cowboy change your ways today

Or with us you will ride

Trying to catch the devil's herd

Across these endless skies

Yippee-yi-ay

Yippee-yi-oh

Yippee-yi-oh

Yippee-yi-oh

Ghost riders in the sky

Yippee-yi-ay

Yippee-yi-oh

I'm intrinsically against any kind of conversion.

It's too much like wishful thinking.

Besides, in a poet, it seems to imply he has nothing interesting left to say.

I said I was only thinking about it.

Surely you're not looking for God?

That's one way of putting it.

Well, speaking as one of the spiritually-undernourished, if you find him, make sure he's still an Englishman, doesn't live on the wrong side of the park.

I assume that was supposed to be amusing.

Why Catholicism, Father?

Something permanent, unchanging.

You can get that from dressage but without the guilt.

There is no need to be snide.

If all you can do is ridicule, it would be better if you remained silent.

Better still, go outside and wait in the car.

Well, it's a long drive back to London, so the sooner we can get started, the better.

 Siegfried,

what do you ask of the Church of God?

 Faith.

 What does faith offer you?

Life everlasting.

 If you then desire to enter into life,

keep the commandments.

"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart

"and with thy whole soul and with thy whole mind."

Siegfried, do you renounce Satan?

I do renounce him.

And all his works?

I do renounce him.

And all his pomps?

I do renounce him.

Receive this burning light and keep thy baptism so as to be without blame.

Keep the commandments of God, that when the Lord shall come to the nuptials, thou mayest meet Him together with all the Saints in the heavenly court, and mayest thou have eternal life for ever and ever.

Siegfried, go in peace and the Lord be with you.

The fool hath said in his heart there is no God.

You will be drawn up in your feelings

above understanding

to the radiance of divine darkness

that transcends all being.

Christ, receive my soul

and release me from the imprisonment of doubt.

And grant me peace.

 I'm quite appalled by what you've done.

I can only hope your CO in Liverpool

will ignore your letter.

I'm terrified that you will be put under arrest.

We read your statement,

Lieutenant, with some alarm.

You may sit if you wish, Lieutenant.

Thank you, sir.

Why did you make it?

I wanted to state my position regarding the conduct of the war.

It is not your place to question how the war is being prosecuted.

Your duty lies in obeying orders.

Duty?

That word covers a multitude of sins.

In the face of such slaughter, one cannot simply order one's conscience.

One can do better than that.

One can ignore it.

That reply was so disgraceful, you ought to be in politics.

That was impertinent,

Lieutenant.

Are you pro-German?

No. I'm pro-human.

We are not here to discuss humanity, that is religion's sphere of operations.

And what of morality?

Morality is a luxury that we can only afford during peace time.

I would be very grateful if you would take that offensive tone out of your voice.

Voices raised in anger only perpetuates war.

And passive resistance only invites defeat.

I simply cannot remain silent in the face of such casualties.

Someone must, should be brought to book.

The casualties, young man, are a matter for the

Imperial General Staff.

And your statement, indeed your entire attitude, is both offensive and detrimental to military discipline.

My colleague is quite right.

It is not your place to question your superiors, much less to imply that they are not honourable.

Perhaps, sir, if you, if any of you were to visit the front, then you might at least spare a thought for the many bereaved families and the pain they suffer.

You are out of order, sir!

I thought that was the very reason for my being brought before you.

This has gone far enough.

Yes, of course.

Yes, I agree.

Myself and my fellow officers feel that your mind is still in chaos and that you are unfit to be trusted with men's lives.

It is therefore the Board's decision that you should be sent to a hospital for nervous diseases in Scotland.

We therefore order you to report immediately

to Craiglockhart, in Edinburgh.

Good morning, Lieutenant.

You may leave your coat and luggage here.

A porter will take them up to your room.

 Name?

Sassoon, Siegfried.

 Rank?

- Second Lieutenant.

- Age?

 30.

Years of complete service?

 Two years, eleven months.

Completed months

with Field Force?

 Thirteen months.

Disease?

I've had some sort of breakdown.

Nervous debility?

Yes, I believe that's what they call it.

Enter it as neurasthenia, Matron.

As we came in, sir,

I noticed several men with blue dots on their faces.

Morphine.

Morphine?

The dots denote that they've had their doses, so that they are given no more until the appropriate time.

Who will be treating this man?

- Doctor Rivers.

- Rivers' office is next door.

I think it would be polite if you introduced yourself.

Yes, sir.

And in your room, you will find an armband.

It is to be worn at all times, especially outside the hospital grounds.

It is to show that you are a serving soldier in hospital and not a conscientious objector.

We wouldn't want you to be attacked in Princes Street, now, would we?

Which arm shall I wear it on, sir?

The pleasure of that choice, Lieutenant, is entirely yours.

Your room is on the upper floor at the end of the corridor.

Dismissed.

Hmm?

Sassoon, Siegfried,

Lieutenant.

Your burgeoning fame precedes you.

I enjoyed The Old Huntsman

very much.

You may not know, but we have a house magazine, The Hydra.

I'm sure it would welcome a contribution from you.

Well, I'll, erm, try to write something light and amusing.

Oh, there's no need to go that far.

You have an appointment to see me at 10:30 in the morning.

Dear Mother, have arrived in Dottyville.

Wish you were here.

Good morning, Doctor.

Good morning, Sassoon.

Please, sit down.

We're quite relaxed here.

Although we do seem to go through rather too many chief medical officers, some are more flexible than others.

Then they're replaced by someone who wants everything to be as taut as Aldershot.

Then they too are replaced.

And what's your persuasion?

Oh, I prefer a certain measure of laxity.

One can't be at attention forever, it plays havoc with the nerves.

From the, er, little I know of your method of treatment here,

I understand that from whatever I say you can deduce whether or not my grandmother was a dipsomaniac.

Was she?

Alas, no, no.

Just a sweet sherry at

Christmas and on birthdays.

Well done, your grandmother.

She didn't know what she wasn't missing.

Well, just tell me whatever it is you want me to do, and I'll comply with your wishes.

It isn't a question of what I want.

It's a question of what you think you need.

Am I to start? Or do you?

Is there anything you feel you wish to say?

What I feel cannot be talked away or soothed into silence.

Why?

Too many have died.

Too much has been destroyed.

There can be an easement of pain.

A move towards acceptance.

Pain is not the only terror.

There are many more.

Can you name them?

If I could name them, they would cease to be terrors.

That's a very elegant way of avoiding an answer.

All evasions are elegant.

Think of politics.

I've always thought that politicians were too stupid to be subtle.

Perhaps they're just too subtle to be inelegant.

Are you a good soldier?

Passable.

I was a poor marksman.

I never knew which eye to shut.

I understand you were awarded the MC.

Yes.

It's supposed to signify gallantry.

Bravery is only cowardice in extremis.

At the root of bravery lies terror and the fear of fear.

But you were conspicuous by your courage.

Why did you discard the Military Cross?

Disgust at my own dwindling standards and the men I felt

I had betrayed.

It was nothing short of duplicity.

And yet the men under your command held you in the highest esteem, I'm told.

And I them.

They seemed to me to be all that was good and true in this world.

Are you searching for truth?

Isn't everyone?

And if you find it, what then?

Peace of mind, contentment.

No longer yearning for what's been lost.

Loveliest of trees

The cherry now

Is hung with bloom

Along the bough

And stands about

The woodland ride

Wearing white

For Eastertide

Come in.

Lieutenant Sassoon?

Yes.

I'm Wilfred Owen.

There was howling last night.

Like a wolf.

Strictly speaking, wolves ululate.

But howling will do.

Now, don't make light of it like that, Doctor, please.

That isn't what I'm doing.

I'm merely keeping it in perspective.

I'm sorry if I sounded uncaring.

His screams were terrible.

Worse than an animal.

Such anguish in them.

Why do all the worst terrors come at night?

The night is, I think, like the unconscious.

Waiting all day so that it can steal over you in the dark.

You make it sound almost benign.

Perhaps it is.

I believe Wilfred Owen introduced himself to you the other day.

Yes.

He seems so gentle.

Feel rather protective of him.

Does that protectiveness hide something deeper?

Yes.

All my friendships do.

But I've never allowed my emotions to mar or spoil them,

I remain passive.

It's how I cope.

You never act on impulse?

No, never.

I'm unable to take risks.

It's the hero in me.

Why not?

Too afraid, too inhibited.

Shamed by an inner corruption.

Or perhaps it's simply because of...

What's the phrase?

"The love that dare not speak its name."

You are not alone in that respect.

Frankly, Doctor,

I'm surprised.

Why?

The world is full of anomalies.

Well, speaking as one anomaly to another, how do you cope with the law?

I adopt a less than honest respect for it.

So evasion is not confined solely to second lieutenants?

No, it affects all ranks.

I trust after this disclosure, you will be discreet.

Discretion is my middle name.

Well, it's better than Ethel anyway.

One assumes these theatricals have some deeper purpose.

Well, sir, I think they help to give some sort of ease away from the front line.

I doubt that.

Should the enemy perceive that the British Army is always preparing for a tango, the war is lost.

Besides, the spectacle of men dancing with men is never palatable.

I had always thought such creatures went into the library with their service revolvers and did the decent thing.

And how is your treatment progressing, Lieutenant?

Oh, it has its unique moments, sir.

Well, let us hope these unique moments coalesce enough to get you back to active service, fighting fit, as it were.

Doesn't that rather depend, sir, on what's fit to fight for?

But perhaps

I'm just being syndromatic.

Or is that a lapsus linguae?

I beg your pardon?

Lapsus linguae, sir.

Slip of the tongue.

I know what it means,

Lieutenant.

The rest of us may be unable to read Beowulf

in the original, but we're not all complete Philistines.

Of course not, sir.

Carry on.

-Ready?

-Yes.

 Halitosis!

Halitosis!

Your first poem in Hydra.

Long live the editor!

I am the editor.

Hooray for nepotism!

And what do you think of my verse, Siegfried?

It seemed a little too dependent on 19th century models.

You make it sound like

The Courtship of Miles Standish.

Oh, God, no.

Nothing's ever as bad as that.

But you do find my work derivative?

While I was at Clare,

I wasted far too much time reading Swinburne.

It was very bad for my adjectives.

You have to speak directly, not with another's voice.

Look, at first, everyone's work is derivative.

We all have to start somewhere.

At Cambridge, apart from Swinburne,

I did nothing except read

William Morris in a punt and staggered through Maud.

Perhaps, er, my latest effort will please you.

It's called Disabled.

It's magnificent.

It pierces the heart.

What a gift you have.

I have been passed by the Medical Board as fit for active service.

When do you rejoin your regiment?

December.

Just before Christmas.

Oh.

 There was I waiting at the church

Waiting at the church

Waiting at the church

When I found he left me in the lurch

Lord, how it did upset me

All at once he sent me round a note

Here's the very note

This is what he wrote

"Can't get away to marry you today

"My wife won't let me"

There was I

Waiting at the church

Waiting at the church

Waiting at the church

When I found he left me in the lurch

Lord, how it did upset me

All at once he sent me round a note

Here's the very note

This is what he wrote

"Can't get away to marry you today

"My wife won't let me"

What is it, Siegfried?

Nothing.

Wilfred's about to return to duty.

I know.

What will you do?

Nothing.

I will not do anything to make the parting even more painful.

I'd give everything I possess to have him stay just one more hour.

One more minute.

Quick to tears, slow to love.

You know, when I first met him, he had a slight stammer.

And spoke, I thought, with a grammar school accent.

How could I be such a snob?

He really is a lovely man.

And I think the greater poet.

What about your poetry?

It's egotism, really.

That seems a little harsh.

Truth often is.

I have no idea why I come here.

It's really done no good at all, this.

Think of it as a cleansing of the soul.

Why do you have to put it so beautifully?

Will you stay just for a few more moments?

Yes.

Whenever you're ready, sir.

 Wilfred was killed

just a week before the war ended.

What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?

Only the monstrous anger of the guns.

Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle

can patter out their hasty orisons.

No mockeries for them from prayers or bells,

nor any voice of mourning,

save the choir's.

The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells

and bugles calling for them from sad shires.

What candles may be held to speed them all?

Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes

shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes.

The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall,

their flowers, the tenderness of silent minds,

and each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.

The woman posing, who appears to be wearing a spinnaker is Lady Ottoline Morrell.

More hair than self-restraint, but definitely nobody's fool.

She looks as though she hasn't heard a joke since the Boer War.

For Ottoline, the Boer War was the joke.

Ottoline.

May we pause for a moment, Dorothy,

-before rigor mortis sets in?

-Of course, Ottoline.

Who is this extremely beautiful young man, Robbie?

Sassoon, Siegfried.

It sounds Wagnerian.

It's just Home Counties,

I'm afraid.

So you are not a keeper of the flame at Bayreuth?

No, no, I'm afraid not.

What are your musical tastes then?

Er, Ravel, Albeniz, Chausson.

Scriabin, if I must.

Cesar Franck, when I'm in the mood.

And Bartok?

Oh, no. Never Bartok, no.

His music always sounds to me like a lunatic playing the xylophone.

Vice versa.

I once heard Paderewski play

Bartok at Tunbridge Wells, but I found it rather disappointing.

Well, what did you expect, Robbie?

It was Tunbridge Wells.

Come into the main house and have tea.

May I join you, Ottoline?

Of course. Dorothy, you are not a servant, but an honourable.

Now come along, Mr Bassoon, and tell me what you really have against Mr Bartok.

Not a great deal.

I just don't like his music.

 Oh, a word into your shell-like,

she'll ask you to stay the night.

She always asks attractive young men to stay the night.

So lock your bedroom door

or wear something very, very severe.

I thought that I might be more interesting than cocoa.

I'm afraid I prefer cocoa.

Sleep badly.

 Dickie. Curse the Wood! It's time to go.

 O Christ, what's the good?

We'll never take it, and it's always raining.

 They snipe like hell!

O Dickie, don't go out!

 I fell asleep.

Next morning, he was dead.

And some slight wound lay smiling on the bed.

Ivor Novello... of Keep The Home-Fires Burning

fame.

Hmm, yes.

That loathsome little tune.

Ah, he always writes at the top of his voice, but we must try to be charitable.

Ah, Sybil, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

Ragtime indeed.

Yes, I know.

But Mr Novello plays it so well, it's almost music.

Besides, at the moment, he's appearing in the West End in a very successful play called The Rat.

I know.

Someone asked me if it was autobiographical, but I said I wasn't sure.

One day, Robbie, you will go too far.

Oh, one day, Sybil, we will all go too far.

Thank you for coming,

Mr Sassoon.

We're all very eager to hear your recitation.

Thank you, Lady Colefax.

Ladies and gentlemen, pray silence for one of our greatest poets,

Mr Siegfried Sassoon.

When I'm among a blaze of lights, with tawdry music and cigars and women dawdling through delights and officers in cocktail bars, sometimes I think of garden nights and elm trees nodding at the stars.

I dream of a small fire-lit room.

Yellow candles burning straight, and glowing pictures in the gloom, and kindly books that hold me late.

Of things like these

I choose to think when I can never be alone.

And then someone says,

"Another drink," and turns my living heart to stone.

Hmm.

Thank you, Mr Sassoon.

That was very touching.

We both thank you, Sybil, and now go and rejoin Lady Cunard before she starts launching something.

And to think he once played the triangle so beautifully.

What a waste.

 I seem to be the victim of a cruel jest

It dogs my footsteps with the girl I love the best

She's just the sweetest thing that I have ever known

And yet we never get the chance to be alone

My car will meet her and her mother comes, too

It's a two-seater

Still her mother comes, too

At Ciro's when I am free at dinner, supper or tea

She loves to shimmy with me

And her mother does, too

We buy her trousseau

And her mother comes, too

Asked not to do so

Still her mother comes, too

She simply can't take a snub

I go and sulk at the club

Then have a bath and a rub

And her brother comes, too

To golf we started

And her mother came, too

Three bags I carted

When her mother came, too

She fainted just off the tee

My darling whispered to me

"Jack dear, at last we are free"

But her mother came, too

He is considered very beautiful.

Look at those shoulders.

Yeah, and look at his.

Are we leaving, Ivor?

No, precious.

I'm anxious to meet our distinguished guest,

Mr Sassoon.

I'm eager to have your advice on my next musical.

I'm thinking of writing in terza rima.

That's near Naples, isn't it?

Oh, dear Robbie, whose silences are always so much more eloquent than speech.

Robbie will give you a paw to guide you home, Glen.

- C'est la vie.

C'est la guerre.

Oops.

Just leave the keys on the dresser, Glen.

You know how absent-minded

I am with them.

I think he's still in love with you.

The main drawback with love is that it descends, all too quickly, into possessiveness.

That really is a bore.

What shall I do with these?

Oh, they're for you.

Hamo died so far away.

While I have his sword,

I still have him.

We never grieved properly for him, Mother.

Before grief, there's anger.

 I watch you on your constant way,

in selfless duty long grown grey.

and to myself,

I say that I have lived my life to learn

how lives like your unasking earn.

Aureoles that guide and burn

in heart's remembrance

when the proud who snared the suffrage of the crowd

are dumb and dusty browed.

For you live onward in my thought

because you have not sought rewards that can be bought.

And so when I remember you,

I think of all things rich and true

that I have reaped and wrought.

Thank God you survived.

Good night, darling.

Good night, Mother.

Give me your hand, my brother.

Search my face.

Look in these eyes lest I should think of shame.

For we have made an end of all things base.

We are returning by the road we came.

Your lot is with the ghosts of soldiers dead,

and I am in the field where men must fight.

But in the gloom,

I see your laurelled head

and through your victory

I shall win the light.

Sleep in heavenly peace

3,500 copies of

Counter-Attack sold.

Your fame is spreading, Siegfried.

Like a virus?

Oh, don't be contrary.

So I wake up famous.

Like Byron.

And I believe you've been overwhelmed by visits from all the great and the good.

Mmm.

Massine, Lydia Lopokova,

Keynes,

Winston Churchill and mother.

Even "boy actor" Noel Coward.

Have I left anyone out?

The Pope.

That's right, Siegfried, think small.

How did you find Mr Churchill?

Imperial.

And Mr Coward?

Gushing.

What would you have done if Royalty had paid a call?

Oh, well, then I'd have tried to curtsey from a sitting position.

Speaking of Royalty,

I've come with a command from Her Majesty

Edith Sitwell.

You are to attend a performance at Carlyle Square of her Entertainment-Façade.

Poetry, by Edith.

Music, Willie Walton.

I've gone to a great deal of trouble to get this so don't let me down.

If you don't attend,

La Sitwell has threatened to come to your flat at Half Moon Street and hum the whole of Tannhauser to you.

You have been warned.

Oh, I, er...

Ottoline Morell popped in and wished to be remembered to you.

How was she?

Let's just say I've always found lime green a very unforgiving colour.

Poor Ottoline.

She'll go to her grave overdressed.

I'm looking forward to meeting your mother.

What?

I said I was looking forward to meeting your mother.

All mothers, good or bad are always fascinating.

I tried to set fire to mine once, but she was all asbestos.

Oh, do come on!

We shall never get down to Kent at this rate.

Oh, and I found this for you on the floor.

Oh, it'll be from Robbie Ross.

Why are you so antipathetic towards him?

Because I resent the way that he speaks to me.

Like he's always putting me in my place.

You know, the only problem with knowing one's place is that other people never seem to know theirs.

He's acerbic, I grant you, but he's never malign, and as a friend, very steadfast.

Robbie Ross took some considerable risk when he publicly supported

Oscar Wilde.

He's been hounded ever since by Lord Alfred Douglas.

Oh, please,

Bosie was always vindictive.

Robbie should have known that from the beginning.

He's really only got himself to blame.

That's really unfair.

His loyalty to Wilde was exemplary.

All right, all right.

Robbie's a saint.

Now, how about we drop the subject?

Oh, that's a very fine sword.

It was my brother's.

Hmm.

He was killed at Gallipoli.

Oh, God.

What is it?

It's the first performance of Façade, and I was supposed to go to it.

Well, where's it being performed?

Some private performance in Carlyle Square.

Chelsea.

Well, even if we drove like the wind, we should never make it.

Robbie will be furious.

And so will Edith Sitwell.

It's being given to a very select audience.

I'm sure she'll understand once you explain why you weren't able to be there.

Oh, no,

I don't think so, Mother.

Edith can be a very captious woman.

She isn't a woman.

She's an animated meringue.

And those teeth.

Don't be horrible, Ivor.

She suffers, I believe, from a complaint known as receding gums.

She's so autocratic,

I'm surprised she gave them permission to.

Oh, well, come along then.

Might as well see if we can catch some of it.

I'm sorry to have to rush off like this, Mother.

It doesn't matter.

Is he just another one of your pretty boys?

No, it's deeper than that, much deeper.

You don't like him, do you, Mother?

He's amusing, but unpleasant.

It's his eyes.

I think they're cruel.

Good night, Mother.

Good night, Siegfried.

You never came.

Please forgive me, Edith.

I shall try.

I'm entirely to blame.

We visited my mother in Kent and I simply lost all sense of time.

- We?

- Mmm.

Myself and Ivor Novello.

A man at the cheaper end of poetry.

I do hope you can forgive me, Edith, for I am mortified by my thoughtlessness.

How was the work received?

They tittered.

Tittered?

Tittered.

I overheard someone say, in the most odious manner,

"It's this sort of thing

"that makes one glad to be semi-conscious."

- I was deeply wounded.

- Hmm.

My poetry has wonderful assonances and dissonances.

I use words for their colour, not merely for what they are supposed to mean.

Great art may sometimes be so ahead of its time, Edith, that its initial reception can be considered a succès d'estime.

Think of Stravinsky.

But I do not wish to think of Stravinsky.

We are performing Façade

at the Aeolian Hall next week.

I shall expect you there.

Of course, Edith.

I shall come with the speed of a thousand gazelles.

No need for hyperbole,

Siegfried.

A taxi will do.

In the early springtime after their tea, through the young fields of the springing Bohea,

Jemima, Jocasta, Dinah and Deb walked with their father

Sir Joshua Jebb.

An admiral red whose only notion, a butterfly poised on a pigtailed ocean is of the peruked sea whose swell breaks on the flowerless rocks of Hell.

For Hell is just as properly proper, as Greenwich, or as Bath, or Joppa!

Oh, Christ!

I have to go backstage.

Rather you than me.

Ah.

The prodigal.

Well, Edith, you've done it again.

All the fine young cannibals.

You make it sound like a raiding party.

Isn't it?

Stephen Tennant.

I am...

Yes, we already know who you are, Stephen.

But who is this absolute dream in oyster grey silk?

Hester Gatty.

Lady Gatty's daughter?

Yes.

She once invited you to Carlton House Terrace.

But you hardly noticed me.

Then I apologize for my lack of taste.

We're great admirers of your poetry, Siegfried.

Before you take offence, Ivor, we like your work, too.

Careful, Stephen, that was almost enthusiasm.

Perhaps they will play one of your charming songs,

Mr Novello, and then we can dance to it.

I can't tempt Stephen, though.

Why not?

Because I only do the valeta and only when pressed.

I do love dancing.

So do I.

Come on, then.

Whoo!

I didn't know great poets did the Charleston.

I didn't know the Charleston did that to gay young things.

I think everyone should be gay, don't you?

Only in the wider sense.

And this young man is...

Alexander Fenton.

Doesn't it sound as though it should have a title in front of it?

Sir Alexander Fenton.

For his services to the theatre.

Well, that hasn't happened yet.

It will, Ivor.

It will.

I hardly see you these days, Ivor.

How are you?

Horizontally speaking.

Oh, busy, old thing.

Very, very busy.

Still gathering lilacs?

You could say that.

Well, when you've exhausted botany, you might consider moving into the field of blood sports.

I'm told that the men who indulge in them are very, very rugged.

Isn't that so, Mr Sassoon?

You know, I think that's what

I'm going to miss most about you, Glen, your quaint sense of humour.

And how have you been passing your time?

Seeing lots of musical theatre.

Mmm, such as?

Rose-Marie, very enjoyable.

Yes, but so Rudolph Friml-ly.

But it is by Rudolph Friml.

It was a joke, Siegfried.

And how about tonight?

Lady, Be Good!

Gershwin, an unsurpassed genius.

Oh, we really mustn't keep you then, Glen.

You have to admit it,

Gershwin is an exceptional talent.

I don't have to admit anything.

What's wrong?

We're leaving.

But I thought you wanted supper.

I'm no longer hungry!

Name, sir?

Mr Sassoon.

Sassoon, you say.

-Yes.

-Oh.

Hmm.

Would you mind spelling it for me, please, sir?

S-A-S-S-O-O-N.

Hmm.

I'm afraid you're not on the list, sir.

Well, I'm going up anyway.

Telephone me in a couple of days, won't you?

I practically had to force my way in past the stage doorman.

Hmm. You were lucky.

He's been told to shoot anyone not on my list.

Why wasn't I on the list?

Oh, for Christ's sake!

Look, it's been a long run, Siegfried.

I am tired.

I am exhausted.

-You still want supper?

-Yes!

I'm surprised to see

Fenton here.

Why?

I know lots of people.

-Fenton is just another...

-Admirer.

...fan.

You both seemed to me to be very friendly after so short an acquaintance.

Now, I get the distinct impression that I am being grilled.

And that a storm in an egg cup is brewing.

I'm sorry, I don't mean to be petty, but I am...

I am very jealous of you.

Yes, well, affairs are always messy.

Who can know the secrets of a human heart?

Usually the people who don't have one.

Oh, my, my, hasn't it gone chilly in here?

But I love you.

Yes, you've said.

Ivor.

Ivor.

Let me pass.

I'm sorry, sir.

I can't let you go up.

Why?

Mr Novello never sees anyone after a matinee.

Well, would you please inform Mr Novello that I've booked a table for 8 PM?

And I'll be expecting him for dinner!

Yes, sir.

Thank you.

Is there someone else?

There's always someone else.

How do you justify your behaviour?

By asking myself questions to which I already know the answers.

And when all is said and done, my career comes before anyone or anything.

And my work is as popular as I am.

There is a school of thought that regards musical theatre as a second-rate means of expression.

Before you judge other people's work, Siegfried,

I would make sure your own is above criticism.

- What does that mean?

- Just this, that since 1918, your poetry has gone from the sublime to the meticulous.

And tell me, Mr Novello, what did you do during the war?

I gave my talent to my country.

I boosted morale by playing every theatre in the land!

Oh, weren't you the lucky one!

We had the Somme and you had Rhyl!

Well, I see no point in prolonging this unpleasant conversation.

No.

Oh, no.

After what's been said,

I don't expect you to foot the bill as well.

Oh, always the gentleman, eh, Siegfried?

It's better than being a cad.

I suspect this is goodbye then.

Au revoir

might have been kinder.

Please don't undermine yourself, Siegfried.

That's what friends are for.

If you wish to see me again,

I'll be at my flat.

Well, at least that's more original than going home to mother.

Snap.

May I sit down?

Yes, of course.

Do you still dine here?

-Of course.

-Why?

Let's just say I like the trips down memory lane.

What next?

Well, I suppose, in a bad melodrama, I'd kill myself.

And in a really bad melodrama, you kill Ivor.

Seriously, are you all right?

The moment passes, but the hurt remains.

And I was supposed to go and visit my mother and now I've missed the train.

Drive down, why don't you?

I have no car. I can't drive.

I was going to motor down to the coast.

Why don't I give you a lift?

That would be very kind of you.

Where does she live?

Kent.

Then let's get going.

I have absolutely no idea where we are.

Although I, erm, don't possess the wit to woo, may I see you again?

I live in Margate.

Oh.

Pity Margate is so far away.

It's not at the moment.

What about Ivor?

Oh.

Ivor's already been to Margate.

 At dawn, the ridge emerges massed and dun

in wild purple of the glow'ring sun,

smouldering through spouts of drifting smoke

that shroud the menacing scarred slope.

And, one by one,

tanks creep and topple forward to the wire.

The barrage roars and lifts.

Then, clumsily bowed with bombs

and guns and battle-gear,

men jostle and climb to meet the bristling fire.

Lines of grey, muttering faces, masked with fear,

they leave their trenches, going over the top,

while time ticks blank and busy on their wrists,

and hope, with furtive eyes and grappling fists,

flounders in the mud.

O Jesus, make it stop.

We have a guest.

Oh, he's not a guest.

He's an afterthought.

This is my life partner,

Bobby Andrews.

Bobby, Siegfried.

Siegfried, Bobby.

Well, don't look so shocked.

Love has nothing to do with monogamy.

Or are you the faithful type?

I suppose I must be.

If you want fidelity,

Siegfried, buy a pet.

You kept very quiet about this.

Well, that's because

I didn't want anyone else to shake him down from the tree.

You really are a bastard, aren't you?

I do my best.

Now you must excuse us.

We have a casserole waiting.

Oh.

Where shall I put your key?

Back on the floor.

I can't face tea before 11 AM.

Drink it, you misery.

I don't do this for everyone, you know.

I'm the invalid, remember?

Like Chekhov.

Oh, what should I do about my hair?

Have you considered topiary?

I think I might dye it.

Or I could leave it in its natural colour.

When I'm sunburnt, it looks like spun gold.

I'll be with you in a moment.

It's Glen Byam Shaw.

Isn't that good news?

Siggy will be down in a trice.

He's suitably undressed.

We've just been talking about you.

So I hope your ears were burning, all three of them.

Is Stephen naturally unpleasant or does he take private tuition?

I heard that!

You were supposed to.

Siggy! Siggy!

I'm sorry.

What can I say?

There's nothing to say.

It's one of the inconveniences of the shadow life we lead.

Friends may come, friends may go.

Enemies are always faithful.

How is Ivor?

I have no idea.

I don't see him any more.

Did you know about Bobby?

Yes.

You might have warned me.

I didn't want to seem vindictive.

Sour grapes and all that.

I wanted to tell you personally that I'm planning to marry.

She's an actress and a good sort,

I think, and we're very fond of each other.

When did you decide?

Some months ago.

You should give a thought to it, too.

No, if the intention wasn't pure,

I don't think

I could go through it.

Purity is like virginity.

As soon as you touch it, it becomes corrupt.

I hope you both will be very happy.

Thank you, Siegfried.

I shall do my best.

What's the matter? TB?

You should have told me.

Why?

There's nothing you can do about it.

I could have taken you somewhere, to a warmer, drier climate.

That rules out Frinton then.

Is there somewhere we can go to help you?

Yes.

I've been there before.

In Germany.

Haus Hirt in Bavaria.

All cow bells, lederhosen and very, very thick thighs.

So idyllic, you'll want to scream.

But the German men...

Gorgeous!

I wonder what the collective noun for them is.

Oh, don't look so glum, Siggy.

I'm not about to join the Hitler Youth.

Yes. Who is it?

 Hello, Siegfried, it's Alexander.

Is Stephen there?

-Hello?

-Don't call here again.

It was Fenton.

I don't like this at all.

We bumped into each other on Piccadilly the other day.

We had a harmless drink and I gave him your number.

Don't do it again!

If that were a request,

I might consider it.

If it's an order, I'll make a point of disobeying it.

What did Glen want?

He's getting married.

The ultimate capitulation.

I'm sure they'll be very happy.

She's probably as mediocre as he is.

You'll be doing it next.

Thought I'd try my hand at some watercolours.

-Hmm.

-Landscapes and things.

It's the Magritte in me.

This is not a pipe.

Rene will be pleased.

How would you describe your style?

Erratic.

But then I'm giving this to a friend whom I really detest.

You don't remember me at all, do you?

The spa?

Ivor Novello? Stephen Tennant?

Oh, yes, of course.

Yes.

The oyster grey silk.

You're supposed to remember me, not the dress.

Before I met you for the first time, I'd always thought you'd be either mercurial or dark.

And what am I, dark or mercurial?

Oh, neither.

You're more opaque, I think.

So what brings you down here?

I... I should like to say the picturesque, but it wouldn't be true.

I came down in the hope of seeing you again.

I used the painting as a ploy.

Oh.

Well, I'm touched.

No one's ever used subterfuge before in order to see me.

It's the modern thing, liberated woman and all that.

It would be very pleasant if you invited me to lunch.

It would be very pleasant if you accepted.

You really are very lovely.

May I kiss you?

You don't have to ask.

I've never had an affair with a woman.

Only men.

Stephen told me all I needed to know.

All my life, I feel as though

I've been waiting for a catastrophe to happen.

Well, that's optimism for you.

My whole future could depend on you.

You must redeem my life for me, Hester.

That sounds like some sort of proposal.

If I was selfish enough,

I'd ask you to marry me.

If I were foolish enough,

I'd accept.

Oh, I look 500 years old.

Some say I am beautiful.

And, as an aesthete,

I feel that beauty is eternal.

We see it in the eyes of those who love us.

Although my mother thinks that my eyes are like cold seawater.

My buttocks and my shoulders are very well-shaped.

But my best feature is the beauty of my hands.

Almond milk and lemon creams are perfect for them, and one must never laugh too much.

It coarsens one's face, especially if the laughter is gleeful.

Stephen, how can you be so narcissistic?

It is my defence against nihilism and the vulgar.

You cannot conduct a life in that way.

Course one can.

My life is my art.

Yours isn't a life, it's barely a hobby.

That was an ugly thing to say.

I know sometimes it's better to be kind than honest, but you are frittering your life away in pomades and powder.

And if you don't believe me, ask someone with more sense and less love.

You've made your antipathy to me very obvious.

I don't need a second opinion.

I'm going to Salisbury for the weekend.

Edith Oliver has found me a cottage to rent in Teffont Magna.

I thought we could spend weekends there.

Will you come?

I, too, have had an invitation.

From whom?

A German prince whom

I think you more than know.

Philip of Hesse, yes.

And one of

Edith Sitwell's proteges.

A concert pianist called Tchelitchew.

Very Cyrillic, very Russian and very divine.

And where are you going to?

Paris first.

Then we'll motor down to

Bavaria so I can recuperate from life.

After Bavaria, they're going to go on to Venice.

Philip told me that he once tried to make love in a gondola, but that there wasn't enough privacy.

Stability.

Oh.

So it was with you, was it?

You sly old thing.

This all seems very sudden.

Yes, it does, doesn't it?

But then, that's my life.

All go.

Older than God, but without any of the influence.

Am I welcome, Hester?

Come in and see.

Siegfried.

Stephen.

How dreadful we all look.

But I still have beautiful hands, I think.

I'll make some tea.

I suppose you've heard of Ivor's death.

Yes.

They say the funeral attracted a thousand people.

Probably made up mostly by all the people he slept with.

I still have a soft spot for Ivor's work, though.

All those tortured princesses and lovers who have no money, but plenty of sex appeal.

His work was always sentimental nonsense.

He cheapened everything he touched.

I've always thought his particular kind of mawkishness was a kind of catharsis for the dimmer members among us.

That's because you have never known the difference between the two.

We can't all possess your purity of thought.

It isn't a question of purity, but of discernment.

And you were never very good at discernment.

That was rather too acerbic.

Mordant would be the more accurate word.

Are you still very angry?

What do you expect?

You ended our relationship with a letter from your doctor.

How was I supposed to feel?

Still clearly very hurt,

I see.

I had hoped that you might have been a little more forgiving.

If I had treated you the way in which you treated me, how forgiving would you be?

Besides, when the parade's gone by, you have to have enough sense to realize that you are no longer a part of it.

I'm trying to apologize.

You're 30 years too late!

Can't we still be friends?

No.

You once meant so much.

Now you mean so little.

-Sieg...

-Don't trivialise it by saying something glib.

Can I see you again?

In London perhaps?

No!

I rarely go to London now.

And how is George?

Young.

Thriving.

He's like all children.

He has the worst aspects of both his parents.

How about his parents' virtues?

He's cursed with those as well.

I am... very lonely, Siggy.

Is it agony?

One does hope so.

George has an independent mind, which sometimes shocks Siegfried.

It isn't independence, it's wilfulness.

Who's died?

All of us.

George, the pipe was not a good idea.

Looks as if it's smoking you.

Old silver tongue.

We could do without the smoke.

Tea, darling?

No, thank you, Mother.

Thank you for the tea.

George will see you out.

- Goodbye.

- Goodbye.

Charming as ever.

But there's still malice at the edge of his voice, as there always was.

Sometimes, Siegfried, it's more humane to be kind than to be honest.

He constantly goaded my jealousy.

It was like being killed by degrees.

He once told me he thought you were matchless.

We are unique only to the people who really loathe us.

 Will you come to dinner tonight at Mother's?

She'd have invited God if she thought He'd come.

I'm uncomfortable with all that distinction.

I'm not at all an intellectual,

I have a very cumbersome mind.

Oh, please come.

Max Beerbohm said he might drop in for a drink.

Hmm.

Then I shall come.

Just to hear Max's delectable gossip.

You know, he, er... he once described

TS Elliot as

"Poor old Tom who sits there ironically

"analysing an empty sardine tin."

Well, you better get your skates on, and I better get my glad rags out of mothballs.

Now don't miss me too much, all right?

Bye!

Goodbye, darlings!

No welcome?

No bunting?

Not even, "You're looking frightfully well, Stephen."

Am I going to get the silent treatment?

Or are we going to conduct the rest of this conversation entirely in Braille?

Beware the wrath of a patient man.

Who said that?

Confucius, I think.

On one of his better days.

Well, if you're going to get all profound on me, perhaps you could throw in

Ol' Man River as a bonus.

How was Bavaria?

Bavarian.

Did your companion stay long?

Long enough.

And what did you do, Stephen?

Apart from cough?

I... Ooh, what's the phrase?

I lived life to the full.

-All three of you?

-Yes.

It's called troilism,

I believe.

-Or an orgy.

-Yes.

That's probably more accurate, but I won't go into detail.

You know how discreet I am in these matters.

My spies tell me you've been seeing a lot of Hester Gatty.

Hester Gatty's been seeing a lot of me.

I'm beginning to see the light.

A new, secretive you.

Surely you're not jealous?

Of course not.

Now we can all be girls together.

Like Roedean.

Have you slept with her?

No.

Our relationship is as deep as it is decorous.

I've even bought myself some passion-killing pyjamas.

Are you going to marry her?

Yes, I think I probably shall.

You'll make a vile partner, Siggy.

Perhaps, but then I have been taught by a master.

You'll be taking a great risk.

I'll be taking the same risk

I took with you.

Couldn't be much worse.

May even be better.

I can see years ahead for both of you.

Filled with passionless silences and compulsory cocoa at bedtime.

Oh, by the way, as we intend to be living in the country,

I'll be giving up the lease on this flat.

I didn't want to leave you in the dark unnecessarily.

But once we've found a house, you'll have to move out.

That sounds almost like a threat.

It almost is.

So you're going to throw baby's little body out into the cold, cold snow?

No, not immediately, no.

We'll wait for warmer weather.

Can I get you anything before I leave?

No.

I'll write once I get to Scotland.

I said I'll write once...

I heard you. I'm trying to listen to the radio.

-Shall I phone?

-No!

What time's your train,

Mother?

Not for an hour.

We've got plenty of time to get to the station.

I'll come back for you later.

 Remember, marry in haste,

repent at leisure.

I was shocked when you got married and for exactly the same reason.

And now it's my turn to be shocked.

I have given you all a bit of a surprise, haven't I?

-Who's officiating?

-Er, Canon Gay.

Ah.

Oh, I'm sorry, Lawrence, have you met Glen Byam Shaw?

Glen this is TE Lawrence.

Of Arabia?

Not recently.

Are you sure you know what you're doing?

I think so.

In the end, we few, we happy few are always exogamous.

Christ, what does that mean?

To marry outside of one's tribe or group.

Do you specialise in using words no one understands?

Yes. It's my revenge on people who don't know what exogamous means.

Have you chosen any music?

No.

Oh, I'm disappointed.

I thought we'd get something

English and dismal.

What are you doing here?

Hester invited me.

I'm her maid of honour.

The vows that you are about to take are to be made in the presence of God, who is the judge of all and knows all the secrets of our hearts.

Therefore, if either of you know any reason why you may not lawfully marry, you must declare it now.

How are you?

Just very tired.

Is there anything

I can get you?

Have you thought of a name?

No.

I thought we might call him George.

Yes.

My whole future depends on him.

You once said that about me.

Do you want to hold him?

...with homes that are rented

So I have invented my own

Darling, this place is a lover's oasis

Where life's weary chase is unknown...

I'm very happy.

And this is the reason.

Cosy to hide in

To live side by side in

Don't let it abide in my dream

Picture me upon your knee

Just tea for two and two for tea

Just me for you and you for me

Alone

Nobody near us to see us or hear us

No friends or relations on weekend vacations

We won't have it known, dear

That we own a telephone, dear

Day will break and I'll awake

And start to bake a sugar cake

For you to take for all the boys to see

We will raise a family

A boy for you, a girl for me

Oh, can't you see

How happy we would be?

How beautifully blue the sky.

The glass is rising very high.

Continue fine I hope it may.

And yet it rained but yesterday.

Tomorrow, it may pour again.

I hear the country needs some rain.

I stood with the dead.

 Come down from Heaven to meet me

when my breath chokes.

And through drumming shafts of stifling death

I stumble towards escape,

to find the door opening on morn

where I may breathe once more

clear cock-crow airs

across some valley dim with whispering trees.

While dawn along the rim of night's horizon

flows in lakes of fire,

come down from

Heaven's bright hill,

my song's desire.

Belov'd and faithful,

teach my soul to wake in glades deep-ranked

with flowers that gleam

and shake and flock your paths with wonder.

In your gaze, show me,

the vanquished vigil of my days.

Mute in that golden silence hung with green,

come down from Heaven and bring me in your eyes

remembrance of all beauty that has been.

And stillness from the pools of Paradise.

 Rising,

rising the voices of the muffled dead.

Are you going to keep this silence up for the rest of the day?

Look, I brought you down to London because I was worried about you!

-I'm fine.

-No, you're not!

There was no food in the house! No heating!

And you were sitting there in the dark like a Protestant bishop!

-I can manage!

-No, you can't!

If you're going to sulk,

I'm going upstairs.

Turn that rubbish off!

I'll do as I like!

It's my house!

-It's my music!

-That isn't music!

It's commercially grotesque noise made by stupid people for stupid people!

Oh, don't be so bigoted!

 The official numbers

of those killed in the First World War.

The United Kingdom and its colonies:

1,225,914.

France: 1,697,798.

Germany: 2,476,897.

Austria-Hungary: 1,567,202.

Russia: 3,311,251...

 These are the statistics of catastrophe.

Yet from Prime to Compline, life goes slowly on.

Are you thinking great thoughts?

No.

Just sitting here being petty.

Trying to understand the enigma of other people.

So many have died.

Too many.

Most people live for the moment.

You live for eternity.

-Don't say that.

-Why not?

Because I'm afraid

I might believe it.

I would have liked to have been recognised, though.

In some significant way for my work.

Eliot got the Order of Merit and the Nobel Prize.

I've had to make do with the Queen's Award for Poetry.

But Sir Siegfried Sassoon, it would have been nice.

-Despite all the sibilants.

-Oh, Father.

How can you be seduced by all that Ruritanian nonsense?

The greatest argument against

Damehoods and Knighthoods is...

Just look at the people who've got them.

Why do you hate the modern world, Father?

Because it's younger than I am.

Well, you've got to bathe and change.

We're going to the theatre, remember?

Do I have to?

Yes, you promised.

Besides, it's a witty and elegant score.

Even you might enjoy it.

I'm sorry I shouted.

It's... So am I.

Peace?

Peace.

{\an8}My mother said I never should

{\an8}Play with the young man in the wood

{\an8}If I did, she would say

{\an8}"Naughty little girl to disobey"

I'm a typically English rose

But born of typically

English stock

With a typically Anglo-Saxon family tree

I received my education from a typically English way

In a typically

English girl's academy

I play typically

English tennis

At a typically English club

With my typically

English feelings for fair play

I eat typically

English crumpets

With my typically English tea

At the end of every typically English day

Father is a typically

English colonel

Home is a typically

English county town

Mummy and I play typically English patients

As the typically English rain is pouring down

With a typically

English spaniel

Who likes typically

English walks

Cause there's typically

English trees

Upon the heath

And if anyone asked me

How I like this typically English life

I am fed up to my typically English tea

Shall we take a cab?

No, I'll walk home.

Are you sure?

It's getting very chilly.

I'd rather walk.

 Perhaps my latest effort will please you.

It's called Disabled.

I'll come and get you.

Thank you.

 He sat in a wheeled chair,

waiting for dark

and shivered in his ghastly suit of grey, legless,

sewn short at elbow.

Through the park,

voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn.

Voices of play and pleasure after day.

Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time,

town used to swing so gay

when glow-lamps budded in the light blue trees,

and girls glanced lovelier

as the air grew dim in the old times,

before we threw away his knees.

Now he will never feel again how slim girls' waists are

or how warm their subtle hands.

All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,

for it was younger than his youth, last year.

Now he is old, his back will never brace.

He's lost his colour very far from here.

Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,

and half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race.

And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.

One time he liked a blood-smear down his leg,

after the matches carried shoulder-high.

It was after football when he'd drunk a peg,

he thought he'd better join.

He wonders why.

Someone had said he'd looked a god in kilts.

That's why.

And maybe, too, to please his Meg.

Aye, that was it,

to please the giddy jilts, he'd asked to join.

He didn't have to beg.

Smiling they wrote his lie:

aged 19 years.

Germans he scarcely thought of, all their guilt,

and Austria's, did not move him.

And no fears of fear came yet.

He thought of jewelled hilts

for daggers in plaid socks, of smart salutes,

and care of arms, and leave, and pay arrears, esprit de corps,

and hints for young recruits.

And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer goal.

Only a solemn man who brought him fruits thanked him.

And then inquired about his soul.

Now he will spend a few sick years in institutes

and do what things the rules consider wise,

and take whatever pity they may dole.

Tonight he noticed how women's eyes

passed from him to the strong men who were whole.

How cold and late it is.

Why don't they come and put him into bed?

Why don't they come?





# Private Romeo

Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme

I came to talk of.

Tell me, daughter Juliet,

How stands your disposition to be married?

- It is an honour that I dream not of.

- An honour!

Were not I thine only nurse, I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

Well, think of marriage now;

Younger than you, here in Verona, ladies of esteem, are made already mothers.

- Thus then in brief...

- Madam, the guests are come, supper served up you called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in the pantry, and every thing in extremity.

I must hence to wait.

- I beseech you, follow straight.

- We follow thee.

Five, six, seven, eight nine. ten, eleven, twelve...

Good-morrow, Romeo.

- Is the day so young?

- But new struck nine.

Ay me! Benvolio, sad hours seem long.

What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

In love?

- Out.

- Of love?

Out of her favour, where I am in love.

Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

What, shall I groan and tell thee?

Groan! Why, no.

But sadly tell me who.

In sadness, Benvolio, I do love a woman.

I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.

A right good mark-man!

And she's fair I love.

A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

Well, in that hit you miss:

She'll not be hit with Cupid's arrow;

She hath forsworn to love and in that vow do I live dead that live to tell it now.

Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

I'll teach you, or else die in debt.

Mark time, march!

Left. right, left, right!

Then, halt!

Dress right, dress!

Ready, front!

Listen up!

Those of you who did not qualified for the land navigation excersises and are remaining here on campus, you'll be under the command of cadet Moreno and myself.

There will be no officers or faculty on campus for the next four days.

We'll follow a regular schedule without variation.

Classwork, homework, physical fitness.

We are all McKinley

Military Academy cadets.

Which means we will maintain the highest standards of neatness, promptness, orderliness, and military bearing at all times!

And no trouble!

Understood?

Yes. sir!

Dismissed!

Cadet Neff!

Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits

Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

Had I say to stop?

And we mean well in going to this mask, but 'tis no wit to go.

Why, may one ask?

I dream'd a dream to-night.

And so did I.

- Well, what was yours?

- That dreamers often lie.

In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.

- She is the fairies' midwife...

- Dismissed!

What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight?

I know not, sir.

O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!

Read!

It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night

Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;

Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!

So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,

As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.

Josh!

Cadets! No running in the hall!

Yes, sir!

- Hi.

- Hi.

Where are you going?

Glenn!

Gus!

Gus!

Do you think I'm gonna get into West Point?

You really think so?

You ask me everyday.

Feel this.

I've load 130.

Can I go back to sleep now?

- Cadet Singleton!

- Yes, sir!

You've to be showering and be not late for inspection.

Yes. sir!

Dismissed!

Right dress!

Left dress!

About face!

- Omar.

- Shit!

- Cadet Madsen/

- Ya!

Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,

I bade her come..

What, lamb! what, ladybird!

Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

What, lamb! what, ladybird!

Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

What, Juliet.

How now! Who calls?

What, lamb!

What, ladybird!

What Juliette ?

And we mean well in going to this mask;

But 'tis no wit to go.

Why, may one ask?

I dream'd...

I dream'd a dream to-night.

And so did I.

Well, what was yours?

That dreamers often lie.

In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.

She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes

In shape no bigger than an agate-stone.

On the fore-finger of an alderman

Drawn with a team of little atomies

Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;

Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut

Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs

The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,

The traces of the smallest spider's web.

Her whip of cricket's bone,  the lash of film,

Her driver a small grey-coated gnat

Not so big as a round little worm

Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid.

And in this state she gallops  night by night

Through lovers' brains,  and then they dream of love;

O'er ladies ' lips,  who straight on kisses dream,

Which oft the angry Mab  with blisters plagues,

Because their breaths  with sweetmeats tainted are:

Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,

And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,

Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,

Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,

And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two

And sleeps again.

Peace, peace,

Thou talk'st of nothing.

I talk of dreams,

Which are the children of an idle brain,

Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,

Which is as thin of substance as the air

And more inconstant than the wind...

This wind, you talk of,  blows us from ourselves;

Come! Knock and enter!

Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

Welcome, gentlemen!

Ladies that have their toes Unplagued with corns will have about with you.

A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.

She that makes dainty,

She, I'll swear, hath corns.

Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes

With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead

So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,

And soar with them above a common bound.

I am too sore enpierced with his shaft

To soar...

Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

And, to sink in it, should you burden love;

Too great oppression for a tender thing.

Is love a tender thing?

It is too rough, Too rude,  too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

If love be rough with you,  be rough with love;

Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.

What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight?

I know not.

O, she doth teach the torches  to burn bright!

It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night as a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;

Beauty too rich for use,  for earth too dear!

So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,

As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.

The measure done,

I'll watch her place of stand,

And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.

Did my heart love till now?

For swear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

What?

What dares the slave

Come hither, cover'd with an antic face, to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

Why, how now. Wherefore storm you so?

This is our foe, that villain Romeo.

Ttake no note of him.

Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,

And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

- I'll not endure him!

- He shall be endured.

Am I the master here, or you?

Go to.

Go to!

Why,

'tis a shame.

Be quiet, or... for shame!

I'll make you quiet.

Sure.

I like your kicks in it, nice.

- Thanks.

- Is it like a...

- That's the loose string.

- It's cool.

I like it.

And what is... Oh!

If I profane with my unworthiest hand

This holy shrine,  the gentle thin is this:

My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand

To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,

Which mannerly devotion shows in this;

For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,

And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

Ay, pilgrim, lips  that they must use in prayer.

O, then, dear saint,  let lips do what hands do;

They pray, grant thou,  lest faith turn to despair.

Saints do not move,  though grant for prayers' sake.

Then move not,  while my prayer's effect I take.

I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall now  seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

Thus from my lips,  by yours, my sin is purged.

Then have my lips the sin  that they have took.

Sin from thy lips?

O trespass sweetly urged!

Give me my sin again.

It makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.

Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

Come!

Let's away.

Romeo,

Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

Romeo!

My cousin Romeo?

He is wise, Benvolio.

And, on my life,  hath stol'n him home to bed.

He ran this way.

- Call, good Mercutio.

- Nay,

I'll conjure too.

Romeo!

Humours!

Madman!

Lover!

Passion!

Romeo!

Romeo!

Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:

Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;

And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

This cannot anger him: my invocation Is fair and honest.

Come.

He hath hid himself among these trees,

To be consorted with the humorous night:

Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

If love be blind, it cannot hit the mark.

Romeo...

Good night.

I'll to my bed:

This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.

Go, then.

For 'tis in vain to seek him here that means not to be found.

He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

But, soft!

What light through yonder window breaks?

It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,

Who is already sick and pale with grief,

That thou her maid art far more fair than she.

O Romeo.

Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?

Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

What's in a name?

That which we call a rose

By any other name would smell as sweet.

So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title.

Romeo, doff thy name, and for that name which is no part of thee take all myself.

I take thee at thy word: call me but love, and I'll be new baptized

Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night so stumblest on my counsel?

By a name

I know not how to tell thee who I am,

My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, because it is an enemy to thee.

My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words of that tongue's utterance,

 yet I know the sound.

Art thou not Romeo?

- and a Montague?

- Neither, if either thee dislike.

How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?

The orchard walls  are high and hard to climb.

And the place death, considering who thou art,

 if any of my kinsmen find thee here.

With love's light wings  did I o'er-perch these walls.

For stony limits cannot hold love out.

And what love can do that dares love attempt;

Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.

If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye

Than twenty of their swords.

Look thou but sweet,

And I am proof against their enmity.

Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,

Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek

For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.

O gentle Romeo,

If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.

Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,

I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay.

So thou wilt woo.

- If my heart's dear love...

- Well, do not swear.

Although I joy in thee,

I have no joy of this contract to-night:

It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.

O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

The exchange of thy love's  faithful vow for mine.

I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:

And yet I would it were to give again.

Wouldst thou withdraw it?

For what purpose, love?

But to be frank, and give it thee again.

And yet I wish but for the thing I have:

My bounty is as boundless as the sea, my love as deep.

The more I give to thee, the more I have, for both are infinite.

Juliet!

Anon, good nurse!

Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.

If that thy bent of love be honourable, thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow by one that I'll procure to come to thee,

Where and what time thou wilt  perform the rite,

And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world.

- Madam!

- I come, anon.

But if thou mean'st not well,

I do beseech thee...

- Madam!

- By and by, I come.

To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief.

- To-morrow will I send.

- So thrive my soul...

A thousand times good night!

A thousand times the worse,  to want thy light.

Love goes toward love,  like schoolboys from their books.

But love from love,  toward school with heavy looks

At what o'clock to-morrow shall I send to thee?

By the hour of nine.

I will not fail.

'tis twenty years till then.

Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say good night , till it be morrow.

Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!

Would I were sleep and peace,  so sweet to rest!

Follow me

To the shipwreck shores  of a dark and strange country.

I was born

A stranger thinking out loud in a foreign tongue.

I was out of place.

I was looking all around just a'trying to find a friendly face.

But they're all gone.

Did you ever think?

Did you ever think?

Did you ever think? 

Did you ever think, think?

Who left me all alone in this town.

And a busted heart

Is a welcome friend

And when that heart leaves

What will you do then?

And if I cry,

Is that a sin?

And the wisdom is a whisper.

And I'm trying to understand,

What I say, what I think,

Where I sleep, when I breathe.

What I do with my hands.

Did you ever think?

Did you ever think?

Did you ever think? Did you ever think, think?

A lotta people everyday  who will surely drown.

Did you ever think?

Did you ever think?

Did you ever think? 

Did you ever think, think?

Who left me all alone in this town? 

Here is the McKinley Military Academy!

Which strives to develop young men with good character.

To cultivate the traits of honor,  duty, respect, and pride.

Now to accomplish that the Academy follows a military system, in which discipline is cornerstone.

Any cadet who violates regulations or commits offences against good order and discipline must be punished appropriately and justly.

You are all recievied one demerit.

Put yourself to the mess for breakfast!

Company, dismissed!

Carlos!

You take care of Neff.

Pick up the pace, cadet Neff!

Good morrow, father Laurence!

Good morrow, father Laurence.

What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?

Young son, it argues a distemper'd head

So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.

Or if not so, then here I hit it right,

Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

That last is true.

The sweeter rest was mine.

That's my good son:  but where hast thou been, then?

I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.

I have been feasting with mine enemy,

Where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded.

Both our remedies within thy help and holy physic lies.

Be plain, good son,  and homely in thy drift.

Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich Capulet.

As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine.

And all combined.

By holy marriage.

Holy Saint Francis,

What a change is here!

- I pray thee, chide not...

- But come, young waverer, come, go with me, in one respect I'll thy assistant be.

For this alliance may so happy prove, to turn your households' rancour to pure love.

O, let us hence.

- I stand on sudden haste.

- Wisely and slowly.

They stumble that run fast.

Where the devil should this Romeo be?

Came he not home tonight?

Came he not home tonight?

No, he didn't come home.

Where the devil should this Romeo be?

- Hie Romeo!

- Signior Romeo!

Bonjour!

French salutation for your French slop.

You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.

Good morrow to you Mercutio, Benvolio.

What counterfeit did I give you?

The slip, sir.

The slip; can you not conceive ?

Pardon, good Mercutio. 

My business was great.

And in such a case as mine  a man may strain courtesy.

That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.

Meaning, to court'sy?

- Thou hast most kindly hit it!

- A most courteous exposition.

Nay,

I am the very pink of courtesy.

Pink for flower?

- Right.

- Why, then is my pump well flowered.

Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?

Now art thou sociable.

Now art thou Romeo.

Now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.

God ye good morning, gentlemen.

God ye good evening, fair gentlewoman.

- Is it greasy?

- Just no less.

For the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon.

Out upon you! What a man are you!

One, good nurse, that

God has made for himself to mar.

By my troth, it is well said:

'for himself to mar,' quoth a?

Sir, I desire some confidence with you.

She will invite him to some supper.

Romeo, will you come?

We'll to dinner, thither.

I will follow you.

Farewell, ancient lady.

Lady.

Lady, lady!

I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?

A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.

An a' speak any thing against me,

I'll take him down!

An a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks!

And if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.

Scurvy knave!

Pray you, sir, a word.

My... young lady bade me inquire you out.

And what she bade me say,

I will keep to myself, but... first let me say, if you... should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say.

For the gentlewoman is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

Bid her devise some means to come to shrift this afternoon.

And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell be shrived and married.

This afternoon?

Well, she shall be there.

Farewell.

Be trusty, and I'll award thy pains.

God in heaven bless thee!

Farewell.

Commend me to thy mistress.

Ay, a thousand times.

Cadets Singleton, Madsen!

Hi, Ken, Carlos.

Too busy to workout today, cadets?

Come on!

Since you didn't get your exercise in this period why don't you both drop and give me 40.

Yes, sir!

- Forty ? I can't, I have to...

- Fifty for you, Omar!

Shit!

And when you're done, cadet Madsen, give me 5 tours around the track.

Physical fitness is an important component of cadet's education and training.

Yes, sir!

The clock struck nine when

I did send the nurse.

In half an hour she promised to return.

Now is the sun upon the highmost hill of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve

Is three long hours, yet she is not come.

O honey nurse, what news?

Hast thou met with him?

O Lord, why look'st thou sad?

I am a-weary, give me leave awhile.

Fie, how my bones ache!

I would... I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.

Speak! Speak!

What haste? Can you not stay awhile?

Do you not see that I am out of breath?

How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath?

- Is thy news good, or bad? Answer to that.

- Lord, how my head aches!

What a head have I !

It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.

O, my back!

Now other side...

O, my back, my back!

Beshrew your heart for sending me about, to catch my death with jaunting up and down!

I am sorry that thou art not well.

Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

What says he of our marriage?

Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind,  and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous.

Where is your mother?

Where is my mother!

Where should she be? 

How oddly thou repliest:

'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,

Where is your mother?'

O God's lady dear!

Are you so hot?

Is this the poultice for my aching bones!

Henceforward do your messages yourself!

Here's such a fourth come, what says Romeo?

Have you got leave to go to shrift today?

I have.

Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell.

There stays a husband to make you a wife.

Go! I'll to dinner.

Hie you to the cell!

Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse.

Farewell.

Hey you up for some hoops then?

How long is it now to Lammas-tide?

A fortnight and odd days.

Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.

As I said, I remember it well

'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years and she was wean'd.

I never shall forget it, of all the days  upon that year.

Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.

An I shall live to see thee married once,

I have my wish.

I'm sorry.

So smile the heavens upon this holy act, that after hours with sorrow chide us not!

But come what sorrow can it cannot countervail the exchange of joy that one short minute gives me in her sight.

Then love-devouring death do what he dare, it is enough I may but call her mine.

Here comes the lady.

Juliet, if the measure of thy joy be heap'd like mine...

But my true love is grown to such excess,

I cannot sum up sum of... half my wealth.

Come.

Go.

Incorporate two in one.

Thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says:

'God send me no need of thee!' and by the end of the second cup draws it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

Am I like such a fellow?

Thou! Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast.

Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes.

Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter?

With another, for tying his new shoes with old riband?

I pray thee, let's retire.

The day is hot, we shall not escape abroad.

By my heel, I care not.

Gentlemen, a word with one of you.

And but one word with one of us?

Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.

You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me occasion.

Could you not take some occasion without giving?

Thou consort'st with Romeo!

Consort!

What, dost thou make us minstrels?

Thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords.

We talk here in the public haunt of men.

Here all eyes gaze on us.

Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.

I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.

But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.

Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford

No better term than this:

Thou art a villain!

Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee

Doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting: villain am I none.

Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.

Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me.

Therefore turn and draw.

I do protest, I never injured thee.

O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!

Tybalt!

You rat-catcher/

Will you walk?

What wouldst thou have with me?

Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives. that I mean to make bold withal, and as you shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the eight.

Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher by the ears?

Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.

I am for you.

Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.

Gentlemen, the prince expressly hath

Forbidden bandying in Verona streets.

Hold, Tybalt!

Good Mercutio!

- Away!

- Tybalt!

- Is he gone, and hath nothing?

- What, art thou hurt?

Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch.

Marry, 'tis enough.

Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church-door, but  marry 'tis enough.

Ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man.

I am peppered, I warrant, for this world.

A plague on both your houses!

Why the devil came you between us?

I was hurt under your arm.

I thought all for the best.

Help me, Benvolio, or I shall faint.

A plague on both your houses!

They have made worms' meat of me.

O sweet Juliet,

Thy beauty hath made me effeminate and in my temper soften'd valour's steel!

Romeo!

This day's black fate on more days doth depend;

This but begins the woe, others must end.

Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!

Tybalt, take the villain back again, that late thou gavest me.

For Mercutio's soul Is but a little way above our heads,

 staying for thine to keep him company.

Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.

Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here, shalt with him hence!

This shall determine that.

Romeo, away, be gone!

Stand not amazed:

 the prince will doom thee death, if thou art taken!

Be gone, away!

O, I am fortune's fool!

Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

Benvolio?

O noble prince, I can discover all the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.

There lies Tybalt, slain by young Romeo,

That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

Prince, as thou art true.

For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague!

I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give.

Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.

Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

Not Romeo, prince!

He was Mercutio's friend.

His fault concludes but what the law should end, the life of Tybalt.

And for that offence immediately we do exile him hence.

I will be deaf to pleading or excuses; nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses: therefore use none.

Let Romeo hence in haste, else, when he's found, that hour is his last.

Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, that runaway's eyes may wink , and Romeo leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.

Come, night; come, Romeo, come, thou day in night, for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night whiter than new snow on a raven's back!

Why dost thou wring thy hands?

He's dead, he's dead!

Alack the day! He's gone, he's dead!

He's dead!

Hath Romeo slain himself?

I saw the wound, here on his manly breast, all bedaub'd in blood.

I swounded at the sight.

O, break, my heart!

Poor bankrupt, break at once...

O Tybalt, Tybalt.

What storm is this that blows so contrary?

Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?

Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished.

O God!

Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

It did.

Alas the day, it did!

There's no trust, no faith, no honesty.

Shame come to Romeo!

Blister'd be thy tongue for such a wish!

He was not born to shame.

'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo - banished'.

That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,' hath slain ten thousand Tybalts.

There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, in that word's death.

No words can that woe sound.

Go! Find Romeo.

Give this ring to my true knight, and bid him come to take his last farewell.

What news?

I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.

What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?

A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips, not body's death, but body's banishment.

Ha, banishment!

Be merciful, say 'death'!

This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here, where Juliet lives.

Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak.

O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

I'll give thee armour to keep off that word.

Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy, to comfort thee, though thou art banished.

Hang up philosophy!

Unless philosophy can make a Juliet, it helps not.

O, then I see that madmen have no ears.

How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.

Romeo, hide thyself.

Who knocks? Whence come you?

What's your will?

O, tell me, where's Romeo?

There on the ground.

Stand up.

Stand up!

For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand.

Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?

What says my conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

O, she says nothing.

And now falls on her bed; and then starts up, and then on Romeo cries, and then down falls again.

As if that name did murder her!

What, rouse thee, man!

Man!

A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back.

Happiness courts thee in her best array.

But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench, thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.

Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.

Go, get thee to thy love.

I'll tell my lady you will come.

Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you.

Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

How well my comfort is revived by this!

Go hence.

Farewell; good night.

But that a joy past joy calls out on me, it were a grief, so brief to part with thee.

Wilt thou be gone?

It is not yet near day.

It was the nightingale, and not the lark, that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.

It was the lark, the herald of the morn, no nightingale.

Look, love, what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.

I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I.

It is some meteor that the sun exhales, to be to thee this night a torch-bearer.

Therefore stay yet.

Thou need'st not to be gone.

Let me be taken, let me be put to death.

I am content, so thou wilt have it so.

I have more care to stay than will to go:

Come, death, and welcome!

Juliet wills it so.

Madam!

Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

Farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.

Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay, husband, friend!

O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

I doubt it not.

And all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our time to come.

O fortune, fortune! 

All men call thee fickle.

Be fickle, fortune, for then, I hope,  thou wilt not keep him long, but send him back.

But now, my lord Capulet,  what say you to my suit?

But saying o'er what I have said before: my child is yet a stranger in this world.

She hath not seen the change  of fourteen years.

Let two more summers wither in their pride, ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

Younger than she are happy mothers made.

And too soon marr'd  are those so early made.

The earth hath swallow'd  all my hopes but she,

She is the hopeful lady of my earth.

But woo her, get her heart.

My will to her consent is but a part; and she agree.

Lady Capulet.

Nurse, where's my daughter? 

Call her forth to me.

Are you up?

Who is't that calls?

Why, how now?

I am not well.

Evermore weeping for Tybalt's death?

What, wilt thou wash him  from his grave with tears?

And if thou couldst,  thou couldst not make him live.

Therefore, have done.

Some grief shows much of love; but much of grief shows still some want of wit.

Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend which you weep for.

Feeling so the loss, cannot choose but ever weep the friend/

But now

I'll tell thee joyful tidings.

And joy comes well in such a needy time.

What are they?

Well, well, thou hast  a careful father, child.

One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy, that thou expect'st not  nor I look'd not for.

In happy time, what day is that?

Early next Thursday morning, the gallant, young and noble gentleman, the County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride.

I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,

I will not marry yet.

And, when I do, it shall be Romeo!

Here comes your father; tell him so yourself, and see how he will take it at your hands.

How now, wife?

- Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

- Ay, sir; but she will none.

I would the fool were married to her grave!

Is she not proud?

Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bride?

Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have.

Proud can I never be of what I hate.

But thankful even for hate,  that is meant love.

How?

How now, how now, how?

Chop-logic! What is this?

'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'

 and yet 'not proud'.

Mistress minion, you, thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds, but fettle your fine joints 'gainst

Thursday next, to Saint Peter's Church, or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.

Good father, I beseech you on my knees, hear me with patience but to speak a word.

Hang thee, young baggage!

Disobedient wretch!

Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.

My fingers itch.

O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!

Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.

Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee!

What say'st thou?

Hast thou not a word of joy?

Some comfort, nurse.

Here it is.

Romeo is banish'd.

And all the world is nothing, that he dares ne'er come back to you.

Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.

I think it best you married with Paris.

Speakest thou from thy heart?

And from my soul too!

- Amen!

- What?

Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.

Go in: and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to make confession and to be absolved.

I will.

This is wisely done.

Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!

Sir, he is fine.

He was treated in the emergency room.

Yes. sir!

Yeah, but the doctor said...

Yes, I realized that, sir.

I take full responsibility, sir.

Of course.

Yes, sir!

Come weep with me.

Past hope, past cure, past help!

I already know thy grief.

I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, on Thursday next be married.

Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,

 unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.

If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, do thou but call my resolution wise, and with this knife I'll help it presently.

Hold!

I do spy a kind of hope.

And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.

O, bid me leap from off the battlements of yonder tower, and I will do it without fear or doubt.

Hold, then: go home.

Take thou this vial, and this distilled liquor drink thou off.

When presently through all thy veins shall run a cold and drowsy humour.

The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade to play ashes, thy eyes' windows fall, like death, when he shuts up the day of life.

And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death thou shalt continue.

And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.

In the mean time, shall Romeo come: and he and I will watch thy waking.

And this shall free thee from this present shame.

Give me!

Go, hence.

Be strong and prosperous In this resolve.

Love give me strength!

Farewell.

What if this drink do not work at all?

What if it be a poison, which the friar

Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead?

I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not, for he hath still been tried a holy man

How if, when I am laid into the tomb,

I wake before the time that Romeo comes?

There's a fearful point!

Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault and there die strangled?

O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught?

And madly play with my forefather's joints?

And pluck the mangled

Tybalt from his shroud?

And, in this rage with some great kinsman's bone, as... with a club, dash out my desperate brains?

O! Methinks I see my cousin's ghost.

Stay, Tybalt!

Stay!

Romeo!

Romeo...

I drink to thee.

High school ring,

High school ring.

Who would have guessed it was a homicidal thing?

Crying, crying, crying, on your front porch swing.

Eyes swollen up like a yellowjacket sting.

Call him a thief, call him a crook,

You never get back what the magpie took.

Call him a raven, call him a rook,

Sam!

You never get back what the magpie took.

Sam!

Sam!

Your boyfriends mean,

Your boyfriends mean,

I swear, I swear, I swear

I didn't say anything.

Your grandmother's silver

You kept it so clean,

And those dark glasses, can you see what I mean.

Call him a thief, call him a crook,

You never get back what the magpie took.

Call him a raven, call him a rook,

You never get back what the magpie took.

Help!

Help!

Juliet's dead!

Juliet's dead!

How now?

How doth my lady?

How fares my Juliet?

For nothing can be ill, if she be well!

She is well, and nothing can be ill.

Her body sleeps in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with angels lives.

O well you art not conquered.

O my love!

Beauty's ensign still Is crimson in thy cheeks and thy lips, and death's pale flag is not advanced there.

Shall I believe that unsubstantial death is amorous, and keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour?

For fear of that, I still will stay with thee.

And never from this palace of dim night depart again.

Here's to my love!

Here will I remain.

How long hath he been there?

Full half an hour.

Go with me.

Fear comes upon me.

O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.

Where is my lord?

I do remember well where I should be, and there I am.

Where is my Romeo?

Come from this nest of unnatural sleep.

A power greater than we can contradict hath thwarted our intents.

Come!

Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.

Come, go, I dare no longer stay.

Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.

I will kiss thy lips.

Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, to make die with a restorative.

You made me love you

I didn't want to do it,

I didn't want to do it.

You made me want you,

And all the time you knew it.

I guess you always knew it.

You made me happy sometimes

You made me glad.

But there were times, baby,

You made me feel so bad.

You made me cry for

I didn't want to tell you,

I didn't want to tell you.

I want some love that's true.

Yes I do, indeed I do, 

You know I do.

Give me, give me, give me what I cry for.

You know you got the kind o' kisses that I'd die for,

You know you made me love you.

You made me cry for

I didn't want to tell you,

I didn't want to tell you.

I want some love that's true.

Yes I do, indeed I do, 

You know I do.

Give me, give me, give me what I cry for.

You know you got the kind o' kisses that I'd die for,

You know you made me love you.

You know you made me love you.





# Uncle Frank 

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.

Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

[birds chirping]

[birds chirping]

[dog barking in distance]

- [children laughing]

- [footsteps running]

[Mae Ray] Betty, get out of the way.

[Janis] "She put her arms around his neck" and hung there as he opened her trousers.

Then he placed both hands behind her buttocks and lifted her.

"She gave a little hop..."

[Marsha] Like a bunny?

- [laughter]

- Hey, y'all.

[laughter stops]

What do you want, Betty?

Are y'all reading

Lucy and Sonny at the wedding?

It's so dirty.

No.

Mama and Daddy wouldn't like you reading this.

You're too young.

[chuckles]

My favorite part is,

"Her hand closed around an enormous blood-gorged pole of muscle."

[chuckles]

It's not a muscle.

Janis, your little sister is such a weirdo. God, I know.

[Kitty] Betty, come on over here and help me with these beans.

[men shouting in distance]

[Mammaw scoffs] Would you listen to those fool men?

[cabinet closes]

[Butch] Why don't

I chop some celery?

You can probably use it in your casserole.

[Mammaw] Oh, casserole's done, Butch, but here, you can pour that bacon grease out of the skillet into the

Luzianne can right there.

Well, how heavy is that skillet?

I have bursitis in my good arm, you know?

Really?

[Neva] Why don't you just let me handle it, Aunt Butch.

We wouldn't want you messing up your good arm.

Well, thank you, Neva, honey.

What was it that happened to your bad arm?

[Butch] Honey, don't you remember?

The Christmas before last,

I slipped.

I got a hairline fracture in the metacarpal bone in my right hand.

[Mammaw]

I didn't remember that.

It just swole up like a balloon.

[Bullet imitating engine noises, whooping]

[Mammaw] Get those young'uns out of here!

It's a hot stove, and I don't want nobody to get burned!

Bullet, Mae Ray, listen to

Mammaw. Come on, go outside.

Betty, take these kids outside.

Come on, y'all.

Let's go outside.

What in the world is the matter with that child?

I mean it, Bullet.

I'll slap you so hard,

- your clothes will go out of style.

- [men hollering]

- Ah, what'd I miss?

- [toilet flushing]

[laughs] - Hey, y'all know what's good for you, you won't go in there for a while. All right.

Gross, Daddy.

[Daddy Mac]

All right. Oh, goddamn it.

Move! Move. You're in front of my Falcons game. Move.

Bullet, Mae Ray, get.

Y'all, let's go outside.

[Daddy Mac] Get!

Bullet, Mae Ray, get.

Get the hell out of here!

Goddamn it!

I'll whup you both with my handsaw!

Jesus Christ.

[Betty] Bullet! Mae Ray!

[birds and insects chirping]

[Betty] I was always happy when my Uncle Frank came for one of his rare visits.

Sit down.

Nobody else in my family ever seemed interested in me.

You ever read Madame Bovary?

No, I haven't.

But Uncle Frank was different.

He was a college professor, and he lived in New York City.

He used aftershave.

His fingernails were always clipped.

And he wore a gold chain underneath his shirt.

[laughing]

I could listen to him talk all day.

[Betty] Oof, well, um, supposedly...

He was the only adult that I knew who looked me in the eye...

[laughing]

I like...

I don't like...

...who was curious about what I had to say...

[indistinct]

...and who liked to make me laugh.

And in the summer of 1969, when I was 14... that was exhilarating.

[both laughing]

[Daddy Mac] I'll open this one right here. Get ready.

Here we go. Oh!

Thank you, Marsha.

A man can always use an extra pair of socks.

Oh, well, it's from me and Tee Dub.

Happy birthday, Daddy Mac. I hope you don't mind me calling you that.

Hey, you gonna be a member of this family, you'd better call me Daddy Mac.

[laughter]

Open another one!

Bullet! Enough, goddamn it!

Hey, now.

That's how you handle a rambunctious child.

[sniffs]

Thanks.

Well, that one's wrapped up so nice, it must be from Frank.

[Daddy Mac]

Oh. Must be.

[Butch] What is it?

[Kitty] Wow!

An electric shoe polisher.

You think I'm too old to polish my own shoes, need a goddamn machine to do it?

Of course not. No, I...

It's... I have one.

It's just faster and easier.

Next!

[chuckles]

Well, I sure do appreciate your gift, Frank, since I'm the one who always ends up polishing your daddy's shoes.

Hm.

Thank you, darling.

[Mike] Here you go, Daddy.

That's from me and Kitty.

[Daddy Mac]

Ooh, look at that.

Aw, look.

It's a little, itty-bitty screwdriver.

It's a glasses repair kit for when you lose a screw from your frames and whatnot.

[Daddy Mac] Yeah, well,

I could use these a lot.

I'm always fixing my reading glasses.

Thank you, Mike, Kitty.

- [Kitty] And Janis.

- [Daddy Mac] Mm-hm.

- And Betty and Bullet.

- Yep.

[Bullet]

Happy birthday, Daddy Mac!

[laughter]

[Betty] I never knew why Daddy

Mac was so mean to Uncle Frank or why nobody else ever said anything about it.

[laughter]

[Mike] Well, okay.

[yells]

Can I go to the bathroom?

[Butch] Yeah, if you promise to wash your hands.

[Betty] I might understand if Uncle Frank was selfish or rude or snobby, but he wasn't.

He was smart and funny and considerate.

He was the kind of person

I wanted to be.

But he was the one Daddy Mac picked on and belittled in front of everybody.

Uncle Frank was good at hiding how much it hurt him, but I could see it.

[chattering continues]

Uncle Frank, what is it like living in New York City?

Oh, I love it.

See, once you get out of a town like Creekville, not only do you see how small your world was, you also see how much bigger it could become.

In ways you never even thought possible.

Can I come visit you sometime?

Yeah. Sure.

If your parents agree to it.

Of course they won't.

They wouldn't even let me go to majorette camp.

Well, Daddy, he said, no daughter of his was gonna prance around half naked in front of the whole town.

I'd probably end up getting raped, and you know what,

I would deserve it.

He said that?

Mama says it's just the beer talking.

How are your grades, Betty?

All A's.

All A's, huh? No B's?

Mm, no. [Chuckles]

Good. Keep that up.

Ace your SAT.

You could get a scholarship to just about anywhere you want to go.

Oh.

Probably just go to SC State like most of my class.

Ah, come on, now.

You gonna be the person you decide to be, or are you gonna be the person everyone else tells you you are?

'Cause you get to choose.

You do.

I wish I wasn't named Betty.

It's a lady name, and I'm only 14.

So change it.

[laughs]

I can't just change my name.

You can do anything you want.

What about "Liz"?

[scoffs]

No?

"Liza"?

"Betsy"?

[laughs]

Uh, maybe "Beth"?

Yeah, I like "Beth."

And there are so many things a Beth can accomplish besides being a majorette.

My cousin Marsha's a majorette.

Yes, she is, and please don't do what your idiot cousin Marsha did.

She got herself pregnant, and now she's gonna have to marry that imbecilic young man.

Marsha's pregnant?

Shh.

If ever you need me to pretend to be your father so you can get birth control,

I will be more than happy to do that.

Look at me.

And if you do find yourself getting knocked up, you call me first before you talk to anyone else in this family.

I promise.

Okay.

You want me to leave

Madame Bovary for you?

Oh, that would be great.

[chuckles]

Thank you.

[man over speakers]

Attention, new students.

Please allow our student ambassadors to show you around the NYU campus.

These student-led tours depart every half hour.

Uh, Bledsoe.

First name Beth.

Uh, Elizabeth.

I'm sorry.

Thank you.

[Kitty] That was scrumptious.

Wasn't that scrumptious?

Charlotte!

What was that salad?

Oh. It's called tabbouleh.

I never thought to put rice on a salad.

Oh, no, that's bulgur.

What's vulgar?

[Frank] Uh, uh, bulgur.

It's made from a wheat.

[Mike chuckles]

Sure was interesting.

That smells so good.

[Charlotte chuckles]

What is it?

Oh, it's beef.

[Frank]

Lamb.

It's sfeeha.

[Charlotte] That.

Sfeeha?

Yeah, it's kind of like a shepherd's pie.

Huh?

[Frank]

She is such a good cook.

She's been slaving away all day.

Oh, slaving?

And you are such a good boyfriend.

[chuckles] Charlotte, it's so good to meet you.

I have to say that no one in Frank's family has ever even heard of you.

[Charlotte]

I know.

It's crazy, right?

Uh-huh.

Especially since we've been together almost five years.

Shut your mouth!

Yes, Charlotte, shut your mouth.

I bet it's because of the Jewish thing.

What Jewish thing?

[Charlotte] Oh, well,

Frank probably thought that you would all disapprove of him living in sin with a dirty Jew.

[Kitty gasps]

Sweetheart.

Uh-huh? You remember what we decided tonight.

No, uh, politics...

No religion.

That's right.

Of course, yes.

I'm so sorry.

I'm just a bitch. [Laughs]

[Frank] Mm.

That's what Mike calls me.

[Charlotte]

Oh...

I think we're gonna get along just fine.

Hell, I'm just glad you ain't black.

[laughing]

[Mike chuckles]

Okay, let's not forget why we're all here.

To Miss Elizabeth Bledsoe,

New York University freshman, class of 1976.

[glasses clink]

[Kitty] America's birthday.

It's all just beginning for you, Beth.

[Charlotte] Mazel tov.

Mazel top.

[Beth chuckles]

[glasses clink]

Congrats.

Congrats.

Enjoy.

[students chattering]

Do you mind if I sit here?

No, of course not.

I'm Bruce.

Hi. I'm Beth.

Where are you from, Beth?

South Carolina.

Charleston?

No, a tiny little town you've never heard of, I'm sure.

Well, try me.

Creekville.

Never heard of it.

I'm from Bismarck, North Dakota, but I tell people

I'm from Greenwich.

I've decided I'm gonna be who I want to be instead of letting other people dictate who I am.

Other people or facts, apparently.

[both chuckle]

[Bruce] Favorite author.

I can't pick just one.

Okay. Favorite authors.

Carson McCullers.

Eudora Welty.

Harper Lee.

Jane Austen, of course.

Uh, Charlotte Bronte.

No men. Hmm.

Mark Twain.

You?

Well, Shakespeare. Dickens.

Mark Twain.

Ken Kesey. William Styron.

Truman Capote.

No women.

Grace Metalious.

Jacqueline Susann.

[laughs] Sure.

[chuckles]

[laughs] Actually,

I want to take this, um... this class on 19th-century women writers.

Uh, I think the professor's name is Bledsoe.

I hear he's amazing.

Frank Bledsoe?

Uh, he's my uncle.

Seriously?

Yeah.

Would you mind introducing me to him? I mean, at some point.

Something tells me that you and I are gonna be spending a lot of time together.

[chuckles softly]

I hope so.

[siren wailing in distance]

[music playing in other room]

You okay?

Yeah, uh, I-I just...

Uh, I've never...

Oh.

But I want to.

I just...

No.

No, no, we should wait.

No, it's okay. I just...

No, no.

I don't want to screw things up by moving too fast.

I like you too much.

[chuckles softly]

We can keep making out, though.

Okay.

Come in.

I will be right with you.

And... yes.

[chuckles]

Oh, Beth!

Hi. I've been meaning to call you.

I've been snowed under.

How are you?

How are you adjusting to college?

To New York?

I love it.

But, um, this is my boyfriend Bruce. [Chuckles]

Your...

[Beth chuckles]

Okay. It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

I've heard raves about your class.

Good to meet you.

Um... unfortunately, you caught me at a bad time.

I have to type an exam and get copies made before 3:00, so...

[Beth]

Oh, okay.

But I will call you, I promise.

Sure.

[chuckles]

Bye.

I should've called him first.

Hey, Frank, what time does your party start tonight?

[Frank] Around 8:00.

Should I bring a guest?

No.

[Frank] You'd better.

[laughs] Okay.

I'll see you there.

No.

[doorbell rings]

[funk music playing over speakers in distance]

Hello.

Who are you?

Oh, uh, hi.

Hi.

Uh, I'm Beth Bledsoe,

Frank's niece.

Frank's niece?

Oh, my God, Beth.

Hey! Nice meeting you.

[Beth chuckles]

Oh, my God.

My name is Wally.

How are you?

I've been begging Frank to introduce us.

Hi. I'm Bruce.

Oh, my goodness.

[sighs]

I'm just not sure why he didn't tell me you were coming.

Oh, that's because he doesn't know.

He doesn't know?

Oh, I thought he wanted to surprise me.

[both laughing]

Well, okay, it's gonna be very exciting.

I'm excited. Come on in.

Come in, come in, please!

Shut the door behind you.

Hey. Don't smoke in here.

It's illegal.

I don't want to go to jail.

Why not? It's a party.

[Wally] Shut up.

[Beth] So, uh, how do you know Uncle Frank?

Uh, he's my roommate.

[chuckling] Why?

Oh, uh, I thought he lived with Charlotte.

Yes, he does.

We all... We live together because it's a big apartment and, uh... and, uh, rent is very expensive.

Uh, tell you what,

I'm gonna go track him down, and you're gonna stay here.

Uh, do not move.

[Beth chuckles]

No, I'm serious, Beth.

Do not move.

[laughing]

Okay. Okay.

Look at this smile.

I'm gonna go find the alcohol.

Oh, what do you want?

Uh, surprise me.

[music continues]

Hey, Frank.

Seriously?

This is what you do?

[chuckling]

Have sex in other people's homes?

[scoffs]

We're not having sex.

Hm. Okay.

[Wally sighs]

By the way,

Frank's niece is here, and you may need to be a slut of a girlfriend... again.

I cannot believe you are still pissed at me for getting to meet

Frank's brother's family.

Don't you ever take credit for my cooking, Charlotte.

I mean it.

Okay, go on.

[laughter]

Oh, I'm sorry.

I was just, um...

You want a drink?

Uh, sure.

I'll have a martini.

Gin or vodka?

Uh, vodka.

Olive?

Sure. Why not?

[chuckles]

I love your hair.

Oh, thanks.

I love yours.

Enjoy.

Thank you.

[Frank] Oh, fuck Agnew.

It's Nixon who needs to go.

[music continues inside]

He's such a snake.

He'll figure out a way to stay in power.

I don't know, Bernard.

I have more faith in the system than you do.

It's not hard to do, as I have none.

You are...?

Bruce.

Bruce.

[Bruce] Hi.

[Bernard] Hi.

Bernard.

What are you, uh...

I came here with Beth.

Beth is here?

Don't worry, Frank.

We're a lot hipper than you think.

I believe I'll go get another drink.

[door closes]

Beth's a sweet girl.

Yeah, she's a very sweet girl.

[Bruce] I'm not sure where she gets the idea

I'm her boyfriend.

We haven't had sex.

It's not like we ever will.

[chuckles]

She's not really my type.

Do you honestly believe that I'll risk my job, my relationship, my entire life just to have sex with you?

Who has to know?

You think I've never had sex with a beautiful young man, Bruce?

Hell, I used to be a beautiful young man.

You still are.

[chuckles]

Come on, let it go.

My blow jobs are like poetry.

[chuckles]

How?

In what way is a blow job like poetry, Bruce?

Does it rhyme?

Is it metered?

Does it employ aesthetic qualities in addition to or instead of its notional and semantic content?

Wow, you flunk.

Unaccustomed to not getting what you want, aren't you, Bruce?

Seriously?

Seriously, get out of here.

Come on, get out of here.

[stammers]

Come on.

[laughter, lively chatter]

[music playing]

[chattering continues]

Where have you been?

Whoa.

You've had enough.

Oh, no, it's a martini.

Uh, listen, Beth, I need to go.

Your uncle completely flipped out on me.

I think he's stoned.

On pot?

God only knows what he's going to tell you.

Call me.

[grunts]

[bottle shatters]

[chatter stops]

[music continues]

It's okay, Beth. Come on.

What did you say to Bruce?

Let's go get a cup of coffee.

Oh, nope. Not on the rug. Come on. [Retches]

[vomiting]

There you go. Yeah.

You're gonna feel so much better after this.

Believe me.

[coughing]

[door opens]

[Wally] Hey, Frank.

I've been looking for you everywhere to warn you that she was here. [Beth coughs]

[clicks tongue]

Oh, Beth.

She's okay.

What happened?

You little poor thing.

So, where were you?

I was on the fire stairs.

With?

Bernard.

Bernard the pothead?

Can we not, in front of her?

Oh, don't worry about that.

She's not gonna remember any of it.

Here.

Did you smoke pot?

Yes. It's a party.

Yeah, and you're sober.

And marijuana is not alcohol.

No, but it's illegal.

And you smoke it outside where anybody can smell it.

[Beth coughing]

[clicks tongue]

Did he make a play for you?

He's way too repressed to ever do anything like that.

[whispers]

Her boyfriend did, though.

That shrimp?

Oh, I did not like him the minute I saw him.

[toilet flushing]

Bruce said you freaked out.

Why'd you freak out?

Uh...

Beth, do you know what, um...

Wow.

Okay, do you know what being gay means?

Well...

I'm gay.

And so is Wally.

Um, we live together.

We have for ten years.

And the reason

I freaked out is because...

Bruce tried, rather ineptly to seduce me, and he seemed unwilling to take no for an answer.

So I hope you weren't too invested in him, because he seems a little, um...

Gay.

Not worth it.

No, come on. Luckily, you don't need to think about any of that right now.

All you need to do is go to the guest room and pass out.

I'll clean this up later.

[door opens]

Oh, don't worry.

I'll do it.

You came out to Beth tonight.

I know.

I did not expect that to happen.

It gave me a boner.

Also unexpected.

[laughing]

[machinery clanking and whirring outside]

[music playing softly]

[praying in Arabic]

[Frank]

There's coffee on the table, two aspirin and a big glass of water.

[laughing] You should...

You should drink it.

Oh, please tell me you eat bacon.

Good, 'cause Wally, he hates even the smell of it.

But I'm a good Southern boy, and bacon's in my blood.

[food sizzling]

So, you feel any different about me?

Oh, I don't think so.

Never known anybody who was gay before.

Of course you have.

You just weren't aware of it.

Choir director at First Baptist Church.

Mr. Dickerson?

But he's so...

What?

Religious.

Beth...

I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone in the family about me.

Oh, sure, of course.

Eh, we're from such different worlds now.

It wouldn't do any...

[Wally] Change anything?

You don't see them anyways, Frank.

Hey, Beth.

How you feeling?

When's the last time you saw your family?

Uh, I think August of last year.

Good morning, Barbara Stanwyck.

[vocalizes]

I go there at least every two years. You know that.

He shows them photographs of a phony wife, who's also played by Charlotte, by the way.

You want eggs?

[chuckling] Yes, please.

If I told them I was with a man, it would bring shame on them.

Why do you think it wouldn't bring shame on my family?

Americans don't care about honor, Frank.

Ha!

I wish I thought my family could get past it, but I don't.

I think your family would eventually accept it.

[Frank] Here you go. Yeah, well, you don't know my family.

Thank you. No, but you came from them, so how bad can they be?

[song ends]

[Frank] How about this?

How about... you tell your family, and then I'll tell mine.

Are you kidding? In Saudi

Arabia, they would behead me.

[swing music playing]

Ugh.

Your bacon smells like death.

Delicious death.

[Wally] And this music.

[music stops]

[Wally] Ugh.

[percussive Arabic music playing]

Oh, come on, now, Wally.

Please?

[groaning]

Oh, no. Oh, no.

[chuckles]

What are you doing?

[phone ringing]

[laughing]

Oh, that's your phone.

Beth.

Have you met Barbara Stanwyck?

[Frank] Yeah, hello?

Hey, Mama. Isn't she cute?

She's the cutest thing ever.

[Mammaw] Frank, your daddy's gone.

He's gone.

What? [Mammaw]

He died this morning.

Oh, Frank.

How?

Heart attack.

Just out of nowhere, getting into the car. Okay.

He seemed perfectly okay, then he grabbed his arm. Mama...

[Mammaw crying] Oh,

Frank, what am I gonna do?

Oh, wait, your sister's here.

Do you mind holding on?

No, I'm okay.

Hold on.

[Mammaw sobbing]

[Frank] And what time's that land in Greenville?

Yes, okay, Mama.

I promise.

[Frank] Is that the last flight of the day?

[Beth] Love you, too. Bye.

[Frank] Eastern, 235.

[Frank] Okay.

She doesn't want me to fly.

Uh, she's scared of it.

She gets hysterical.

[Frank]

She's not the one flying.

She made me promise

I would take the train.

You can take the car.

Can you hold on for a second?

It's faster than the train, and it'll give you guys a chance to get to know each other.

I would love that.

Yeah.

What? Are you seriously thinking of not going?

Frank, that'll break your mother's heart. You need to go.

You need to stay out of this, please.

You're not gonna run away from this your whole life, you know?

Please, Uncle Frank?

[sighs] Fuck.

Um, okay, sorry.

Uh, change of plans.

We can take turns driving.

No, Wally, you're not coming.

[lighter clicking]

You're pushing me away again.

Just when you're gonna need me the most.

I didn't come to your father's funeral.

No, I did not want you to come to my father's funeral.

[Frank] Yes, and I respected your wishes, and I didn't try to talk you into letting me.

[Wally] It's not the same thing.

I have a question. Are you the stupidest man alive?

Obviously.

Look who I'm with.

[sighs]

Look.

You need me for this.

You know you do.

Wally, I appreciate you wanting to be there for me, I do, but honestly, it will be so much harder for me if you come.

Okay.

Thank you.

I'm gonna do the dishes.

[♪♪♪]

[radio playing softly]

It's so weird.

I'll never see Daddy Mac again.

You've never known anyone who died?

There was this one boy in high school who got killed in a car wreck.

But I didn't know him well.

Some of the other kids who never even talked to him when he was alive started acting like he was their best friend.

So they could cry and people would feel sorry for 'em.

People are idiots.

[laughs]

[The Capitols' "Cool Jerk" playing on radio]

I know. Aren't they?

Yep.

♪ Cool jerk ♪

[Beth] What does Wally do?

[Frank] Oh, he's an aeronautics engineer.

Where'd you meet him?

[laughing]

On the subway.

I was reading Seven Pillars of Wisdom by T.E. Lawrence, and he asked me why

I was reading it.

And I told him I'd just seen the film Lawrence of Arabia.

And he said,

"Well, I'm from Arabia."

And...

I don't know, we got to talking.

[chuckles] Okay.

Saved my life.

What about you?

Any boyfriends?

Besides the idiot Bruce.

No, I'm still a virgin.

Not because I want to be.

Just none of the boys I've known seemed worth the trouble.

I almost did it with Bruce, but he said...

He said what?

It's too soon?

Doesn't want to mess up your friendship?

Something like that?

You think that's because he's gay?

Oh, I think 99% of straight boys would have gone ahead with it.

[chuckles]

I just thought it was my fault.

[chuckling]

Guys like Bruce always make you think it's your fault.

What a jerk.

[chuckles]

[Frank]

That's letting him off too easy.

He's an asshole.

[Beth laughs]

You can call him an asshole, can't you?

[Beth] What an asshole.

[Frank] There you go.

[Beth] What a fucking asshole.

[Frank laughs]

There you go.

"See the world's largest teapot."

[Beth] Yeah, or George

Washington's outdoor bathtub.

Mm. What is the Mystery Hole?

The what?

"See the unbelievable

Mystery Hole."

Uh, I don't think we need to go there.

[Beth laughs]

[music playing over speakers]

Did you always know you were gay?

I... I always knew

I was different.

From day one.

But I... I definitely knew by the time I hit puberty.

You have to realize, it wasn't talked about then the way it is now.

I didn't think there was anyone else like me.

Well, heck, I feel that way.

[chuckles softly]

What about you?

You ever get a crush on a girl?

[laughs]

[chuckling] What?

Uh, not really.

One time, uh,

I practiced making out with

Becky Eller at a sleepover.

Oh... But I pretended she was a boy.

And how... How was it?

[laughs]

Embarrassing.

When was the first time you, um...

I was 16.

Who was it with?

Just a boy from school.

Ma'am, could we get the check?

[song fading]

[♪♪♪]

[Young Frank]

Come on, Sam!

[both laughing]

Sam!

[laughing]

[Frank shouts]

[water burbling]

[♪♪♪]

[Beth] There's a graveyard statue in Parkersburg that weeps.

What?

Apparently, she grants wishes.

[car slowing]

What's wrong?

[engine shuts off]

Stay here.

[insects trilling, birds chirping]

Hello?

Wally?

Oh, hey.

What the fuck are you doing here, Wally?

You scared me half to death.

You forgot your razor, uh, and your favorite tie.

You rented a car just to bring me a razor and a tie?

Isn't it snazzy?

Look, it's a convertible.

You agreed to stay home.

Just admit you're glad I'm here.

Jesus.

Come on.

And stop acting like your father dying is not a big deal.

Of course it's a big fucking deal, Wally.

It could end up being a positive thing.

You need to be part of your family.

I don't want to be a part of my family.

Bullshit, and you know it.

[Beth] Wally?

Get back in the car!

Hey, don't talk to her like this. She's not your kid.

Beth, stay.

Stay.

Look, I just want to help, however you might need it.

And you know you're going to.

You were there for me when I did.

You can't meet them, Wally.

You can't.

Okay, I won't.

And you can't come to the funeral.

But you can come to me whenever you need to.

[sighs]

[crickets chirping]

[female clerk] So, that's two rooms at $14 each.

Uh, I don't think we need two rooms.

We can make do with just one if you have a cot.

What is the relationship?

Uh...

Hmm?

The relationship between the two of you... uh, and the young lady over there.

Oh, she's my niece.

I'm his nephew.

I'm afraid I'm gonna need the young lady to stay in her own room.

Yeah, that makes sense.

Okay. Yeah.

I used to fantasize about different ways for my father to die.

Which, of course,

I felt tremendous guilt about.

You WASPs, you love your guilt.

That's actually not true.

I fucking hate it.

You know, you have nothing to feel guilty about.

Mm, I know it intellectually.

Just make sure you don't bury it all inside yourself and explode later.

Probably at me.

You look like you belong in a 1950s Bible movie.

Oh, yeah? I do?

[man on TV]

Blessed be thou, Samuel.

Here he is, David.

[thunder crashing on TV]

[rhythmic thumping in other room]

[Frank, Wally grunting, moaning]

[bed creaking]

Hey, Beth?

You want to ride with me?

[exhales sharply]

Uh, is that okay with you?

Of course it's okay.

Why wouldn't it be okay?

Okay.

He's cranky today.

[both laughing]

Bye.

[♪♪♪]

So, Beth...

Answer one question for me.

Why is your uncle so odd?

[chuckles]

What's odd about him?

"What's odd about him?"

He's the oddest man

I've ever seen in my whole life.

He seems pretty normal to me.

Really? Huh.

He's so stoic, Beth.

Like a mule.

There's a layer between him and the rest of the world.

You know what I mean?

Uh, not really.

I don't really know him that well.

But I've always liked him.

Oh, dear.

You're just like him.

[laughing]

Must be hereditary.

[both laughing]

[Southern accent]

You guys are so nice all the time.

[laughs]

I mean, don't you get exhausted being nice all the time?

[water burbling]

[muffled chatter]

[laughter]

[inhales deeply]

[laughing]

I know that

Frank's father's the devil and his mom's a saint.

[folk music playing over radio]

His sister knows about me, apparently.

She does?

Mm-hm.

Oh, that's my Aunt Neva.

She's real nice.

[laughing] Beth, I'm not interested in nice.

Nice always hides something.

What's hidden is what interests me.

What about his brother?

What's he like?

Well, his brother's my daddy, and he's not that nice sometimes.

But how is he not nice?

He says mean things.

Like what?

Like, um... like I'm a little smart-ass, and ain't no man likes a girl with a smart mouth.

Yep, he's right about that.

Most men don't.

I think I'm gonna like your dad.

[chuckles]

I really do.

What about your family?

Are they...

Oh, they're very nice.

All right. [Laughs]

[laughing]

They're crazy.

My mom is a woman with a smart mouth.

And indeed, my dad did not like it.

But she's got so much love.

She's my heart.

[sighs]

[engine rattling, squeaking]

What the...?

Oh, come on!

What'd you do to the car?

[Frank] Well, how long's that gonna take?

I'm gonna have to wait to get you a new torque converter in from Greensboro.

Earliest I can have it in for you is Monday.

[Frank]

See, that's not an option.

Well, ain't no other'n

I can think of.

[softly] Fuck.

Just leave it here.

You can pick it up on our way back to New York.

J.B. don't usually like doing that, but...

I'm gonna say yes.

'Cause if y'all come back, that means I get to see this pretty little lady again.

[mechanic chuckles]

[chuckles]

I'm just playing with you.

Y'all don't mind, do you?

You don't need these men's permission to play with me.

You need mine.

[chuckles]

Which I will never, ever give you, because you are presumptuous and disrespectful.

And you're probably even stupider than you look.

[chuckles]

And you look pretty goddamn stupid.

[laughing]

[laughing]

[laughs] You made me feel sorry for that boy.

Gross.

Look at it from his perspective, Beth.

You're a pretty girl.

You're wearing nice makeup.

You're wearing nice clothes.

So it's my fault he's a creep?

You'll have to forgive Wally, Beth.

In the country that he comes from, they like to wrap women up in sheets and lock 'em away because they're just too dangerous.

That's why I left.

Oh.

That and the execution of homosexuals.

Seriously?

Yes.

Beheading, hanging.

And sometimes they're only teenagers.

I knew I couldn't find love if I stayed there.

If I did, I could die for it, but, uh, I did not want my life to be this way.

[insects trilling, birds chirping]

Hey.

You know he can't hurt you anymore.

It's not him.

It's Sam.

Come, let's have some ice cream.

I'm good.

My dad used to take us for ice cream every Saturday, even if we misbehaved.

[gentle ballad playing over radio]

What's your favorite flavor?

Rosewater with cream chips.

It's delicious.

Sounds like soap.

No, it doesn't. No.

[laughing] It does.

[Wally] Arabic ice cream is very different.

It's thicker and chewier, you know, because of the mastic that they put...

[♪♪♪]

[Beth]

Oh, we're here.

[Wally]

"Welcome to Creekville."

[sighs]

[Wally] Hm.

Where's the creek?

You any kin to old Mac

Bledsoe who just died?

I'm his son.

Mike?

[chuckles] You don't even look like yourself anymore.

I'm Frank, the oldest.

Oh.

You're the one who runned off to New York.

That's the one.

[keys rattling]

There's your keys.

Look at me.

[key rattles]

Thank you.

[chuckles]

You need to wait ten minutes before checking in.

Yeah, I know the drill.

No, Wally.

Ten minutes... I mean it.

It's different down here.

Okay, sweetheart. Okay.

That old fart will call the police. They will put us in jail.

I got to get ready to go to the funeral parlor.

[Beth] I thought we were going to the funeral home.

[Frank sighs]

I'll be two seconds.

[train horn blowing in distance]

[door opens, closes]

[bell jingles]

[door opens]

[footsteps approaching]

[door closes]

You want one?

No, thank you.

[liquor glugging]

[swallows, gasps softly]

Do not tell Wally I'm drinking. [Engine starts]

[gentle organ music playing]

[crying softly]

[sobs softly]

[Kitty whispers]

Betty.

Oh, Betty.

Beth.

Right.

I was so worried you two got in a...

Oh. Oh.

Hey, Kitty.

I thought you got in a wreck and were laying dead in a ditch somewhere.

[sighs]

Thank you for driving her.

I couldn't have her on a plane. I just couldn't.

I know.

My stepdad's cousin's son died in a plane crash.

You might remember that.

I get it.

It happens to real people.

I... I'm...

Yeah, okay.

I'm sorry about your daddy.

[Frank] Mama.

[sobs softly]

Frank!

Oh, Mama.

[crying]

Oh, it's so good you're here.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

No warning.

You know, he just dropped dead right in front of me, getting into the car.

We was about to go to the Food Lion.

Oh, Mama, it's all right.

[sobbing]

It's okay. It's okay.

Oh, Frank, Frank, Frank.

He loved you.

Mm-hm.

No, he did, he did, he did. Mm.

He did. He loved you.

You want...

You want to see him?

Yeah. He looks real good. Real good.

Hey, big brother.

Oh, hey, Mike.

He's the best friend

I'll ever have.

Really?

Mm-hm. Yeah.

I only asked him to be best man in my wedding

'cause I was scared not to.

[chuckles]

After the rehearsal dinner, we got shit-faced.

[chuckles]

Goddamn, he was like another man.

He was, like, funny.

Told me how, uh, he felt like he was never good enough for Mama.

He told me how he thought

Kitty wasn't good enough for me, which he was wrong about.

We were both hung over at the wedding.

You didn't notice?

Uh-uh.

I just thought you seemed nervous.

[both chuckling]

I was shaking like an old hound dog trying to shit out a peach pit.

Oh.

[chuckles softly]

You know,

I've been driving up here once a week for more than 20 years... just to have breakfast with Daddy.

He'd ask if

I had heard from you.

Course, I hadn't.

But I never kept in touch much with you, neither.

Well, it's...

Hey.

And for that...

[stammers]

[sobbing] I...

[whispers]

I'm sorry.

[stammering]

You don't need to be sorry.

It's okay.

[Mike sighs]

[Frank sighs]

[Wally] Hello?

Hello?

[woman on phone]

Hello.

Mom?

[both speaking in Arabic]

[bird twittering over phone]

[bottle clunks in trash]

[grunts]

[Kitty] It just doesn't make any sense.

Betty wants to stay in a motel all by herself instead of sleeping at home in her own bed.

It's Beth, and I'm not by myself.

Uncle Frank is staying there, too. So is Wally.

Who's Wally?

He's a man that we met.

Me and Uncle Frank.

He's staying at the motel, too.

Well, that doesn't sound right.

No, ma'am, that sounds wronger than wrong.

How old are you, Betty?

It's...

I'm 18, and it's Beth.

18, and you want to stay by yourself in a motel?

Aren't you... Aren't you concerned about your reputation?

My reputation with whom?

Men care about things like that.

Trust me,

I know from experience.

[Frank] It's almost 9:00.

We should be headed back.

Frank, I don't understand why Betty has... [scoffs]

Beth has to stay in a motel when she can sleep at home in her own bed.

It's a waste of money.

Well, I'm not sure that's your decision to make, Kitty, because Beth is an adult now and she gets to make up her own mind.

It's only my second time in a motel, Mama.

It's fun.

Well, I hope it's clean, at least.

Frank, who is Wally?

I told them about the man we met at the motel, with the Winnebago.

Oh, the guy with the dog?

Yeah.

They're traveling across America.

[Beth] He's so cute, Mama.

Smartest dog I ever met.

You got to be careful about strange dogs, you know.

They can bite you.

He's blind.

[chuckling]

The dog, not the driver.

[woman speaking in Arabic]

[Beth] Good night.

[woman speaking in Arabic]

[kissing loudly]

Frank. Frank.

[Frank sighs]

[sighs]

I can smell the alcohol.

[sniffs]

Look, if ever I had a reason to drink, this would be it.

Bullshit.

Can you just stop?

I can't take it from you,

Wally. Not right now.

At least wait till this whole thing is over.

Can you do that for me?

Would that be okay with you?

Could you do it for me?

I won't go through it again. I won't.

I'll be up if you need to talk.

Good night.

Mac Bledsoe was the kind of man you don't see much anymore.

Dedicated husband.

Loving father.

Good American.

Good Christian.

A man for whom doing the right thing, it wasn't a choice.

It was his duty.

It was his duty to teach his children the difference between right and wrong.

[sportscast playing indistinctly]

And now it's our duty.

It's our duty to walk... in the same path of righteousness as Mac.

[Daddy Mac] I don't want you seeing that Lassiter boy again.

If I find out you are,

I'll kill you both.

You're gambling with your very soul, son.

Opening yourself up to that sickness.

You want to be a queer, hm?

A faggot?

It's perversion.

God hisself will turn his back on you.

Cast you into the lake of fire.

[sighs]

[preacher] It's what

God expected of Mac, and it's what God now expects of us.

Let us pray.

Our Father...

[others join in] who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.

[insects trilling]

Thy kingdom come.

Thy will be done...

[panting]

...on Earth as it is in Heaven.

[sighs]

Oh, my God.

Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.

Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever.

[water burbling]

Amen.

[engine rumbling outside]

[clock ticking]

[insects trilling]

[sighs, grunts]

[♪♪♪]

[Marsha] Mm. Everyone up there talk like a Yankee?

Not everybody.

Mm, mm!

You see any famous people in New York?

Yes. Truman Capote.

Truman who?

Oh, I think I saw Rhoda's mom from The Mary Tyler Moore Show.

Oh!

[chuckles]

So, what about you?

How's life?

Mm.

Honestly, Beth,

I've never been happier.

That's great, Marsha.

Yeah.

I love being a mother.

I love being pregnant.

I love Travis more every day.

He's a really good daddy.

Uh, Travis?

Mm. Mm-hm.

He don't go by Tee Dub no more now that he's a business owner.

Yeah. [Chuckles]

But, oh, we still get it on all the time.

He is very blessed in that department.

[chuckles]

[softly]

That's nice.

What's wrong, monkey?

You want to wear Mama's shoes?

[mumbles]

[laughs]

He loves to do that.

I have no idea why.

[chuckles]

[Neva] So, how's Wally?

He's good.

I think he should be here with you.

He is here.

He's at the motel.

Well, go get him.

Get him?

I want to meet him.

After all these years.

At Dad's funeral?

"Excuse me, everyone.

I have an announcement to make."

Frank, it is 1973.

And I know Beau would be okay with it, and Kitty, probably.

Mike, that's a question mark.

No shit.

You want one?

No, thank you.

You sure?

I'm sure.

Mm.

It's just for this.

I swear.

You want to pinkie-promise me?

Pinkie promise.

What kind of wake doesn't have a bar?

One in this town.

I'm just waiting for Aunt Butch to ask me,

"Is there any news on the female front?"

She has a spider in her hair.

She what?

[laughing] Yeah.

I shared a car with her to the cemetery, and I...

I thought I saw something moving in there.

[laughing] I looked closer, and it was a spider.

Did you tell her?

You didn't?

[laughing]

Oh, I don't want to hurt her feelings.

I mean, remember how mad she got when I told her her wig was on backwards and she'd just been in church all day? [Laughing]

That's why she stopped wearing wigs.

Well...

[chuckles]

My baby. My baby boy.

Mm-hm.

[chattering]

[door closes]

Well, hey there, Frank.

I've been looking for you.

Aunt Butch, don't you look pretty today.

Tell me, any news on the female front?

Nope.

Well, how old are you?

You must be getting on up there.

I'm... I'm 46.

Well, you got to get moving, boy.

You're gonna end up like me. Oh.

Course, it's different for men.

[chuckles, clicks tongue]

[sighs softly]

[Mike] Hey.

Y'all need to come in the house.

Is anything wrong?

No. The lawyer's here.

I realize this is unorthodox timing and a rather unusual venue for the reading of the will, but Mac wanted to make sure that it happened while all his kids were still here.

[lawyer clears throat]

All right, then.

[clears throat]

"I, Francis MacKenzie Bledsoe, being of sound mind and body, do hereby declare this to be my last will and testament.

First, to my wife

Evelyn Caldwell Bledsoe,

I leave the whole of my estate and assets, with the exception of the following designated amounts.

To my son,

Michael James Bledsoe, and to my daughter,

Neva Mae Bledsoe Henderson,

"I leave the sum of $25,000 each."

To my sister,

Florence Vivian Bledsoe,

I leave the sum of $500.

To my oldest son,

Francis MacKenzie Bledsoe, Jr...

I leave nothing but disgust with the filthy and unnatural perversion he engages in with other men,

"and shame that he carries my name." [gasps softly]

[Frank groans softly]

What?

[stammers softly]

[Mammaw exhales sharply]

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

[clicks tongue]

[crying] Frank.

I'm so sorry, Frank.

I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Frank, please don't go.

Please don't go.

Frank!

[sighs]

He's never gonna come back.

Jesus.

[engine starts]

[Janis] How's life?

Life sucks, Beth.

I'm 22, I work at the bakery at the goddamn Food Lion, and I still live at home with Mama and Daddy.

Oh, my Lord, y'all are not gonna believe what just happened.

Daddy, I need to borrow your car.

Daddy, it's an emergency!

Wait, what kind of emergency?

Just give me the goddamn keys!

[insects trilling]

[gate clangs]

Frank.

[lock clicking]

Is Uncle Frank here?

Isn't he at the wake?

No, he left.

Everybody knows he's gay now.

Daddy Mac put it in his will.

But Uncle Frank got in the car and drove away.

Was he drunk?

Was he drunk?

I think so.

Oh, my God.

Why would he drive drunk?

[water burbling]

Stay right there.

We can't ever do that stuff again.

Frank.

We have to stop now... if we want any chance to be normal and not end up perverts.

Do you want to be a faggot?

A queer?

Do you want to go to hell?

'Cause it's a sickness!

And God hates it.

Don't ever come near me... or talk to me again.

[insects trilling]

[panting]

[bird squawking]

[Beth] Why do you think he's at the lake?

[Wally] 'Cause I know what happened there, Beth.

I know how Frank is when he gets drunk.

There should be a gate up here on the left.

[sighs] Fuck.

[Beth] This way.

[Beth]

Maybe he went for a swim?

He'd never take these off.

[Wally]

Frank!

Fuck! Fuck!

Why are you in my room?

Frank?

You fucking idiot of a moron! What? What?

Do you know what you just put me through?

I just went for a swim.

I couldn't find my car.

Jesus. Wake up... the fuck up, Frank!

You're not the only one something bad happened to. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

[Wally] There are people who love you.

[Frank] Yeah, well, people are idiots.

Fuck.

Oh, you motherfucker.

Fine.

Go ahead, destroy yourself.

Destroy us.

Us?

What the fuck is us?

I hate us.

We're freaks. Cheers.

[Frank, Wally grunting]

Uncle Frank, don't!

[yells]

He's just trying to help you.

[Wally] Stop it!

[Frank] Fuck you!

Stop it!

Get off me!

[grunts] Fucker!

Stop it!

Fuck you!

Frank! [Groans]

You motherfucker!

You faggot!

You pussy!

Faggot! [Panting]

Frank, it's okay.

[Frank grunts]

[Beth] Stop!

[Wally groans]

[door opens]

[door closes]

Wally, aren't you going to follow him?

[birds chirping, insects trilling]

Couldn't even say it to my face, could you?

Coward.

[sobbing]

[mutters]

[sniffles]

What did I do?

[sobbing]

[sobbing, muttering]

Oh, God! Oh, God.

[muttering]

[exhales]

Sam.

Forgive me.

Forgive me.

[Frank panting]

Oh, Samuel.

Sam.

Frank.

[Frank sniffles]

[Frank]

I have no family.

You have me.

I'm your family, and you're mine.

Till death.

You know it, I know it, and God knows it.

And that's all that matters.

[inhales]

I'm sorry.

You should be.

Mama made me promise if I found you, I'd bring you back.

I don't want to see them, Beth.

But, so years ago, when you told me

I should be what I want to be, not what other people want me to be, that was just bullshit?

You know, that conversation changed my life.

Now I find out you can't be who you are unless nobody around you disagrees with it.

I thought you, uh... you might want this back.

You want to go meet my fucking family?

Yeah.

If you take a shower first. [Laughs]

Ugh, Frank, it's like the sewers of Sri Lanka.

[laughing] Geez.

[laughs]

At least she didn't crash the car.

Who the fuck is this guy?

Hey, Mike.

Frank.

I got two words for you.

No problem.

You're my big brother.

Whatever you are, no problem.

Hey, Mike, uh... this is Walid.

Hey, man. Call me Wally.

Okay.

[patting back]

No problem.

[exhales]

Thank you, Kitty.

I have to tell you something.

This makes me like you even more.

Yeah?

Yeah.

[whispers]

My hairdresser is gay.

Oh. He is the most hilarious person in the whole world.

I really want to introduce you to him.

We have so much in common, probably. Yes!

Wally, this is my sister-in-law, Kitty.

[chuckles] I love your name. Yeah.

[both laughing]

Aw. Mm.

[chuckles] Oh.

Okay.

[laughing]

Aw.

Oh, God, you smell so good!

Do you all smell good?

[both] Yes.

[laughing]

Come with me. Come on.

I am so proud of you.

And this must be Wally.

Neva.

Oh!

You're exactly how

I imagined you.

Oh, I've been wanting to meet you for so long.

Me, too.

Welcome.

This is Beau. Hey, Beau.

Frank.

And, uh, Wally.

Right?

Beau.

[chuckles awkwardly]

Um...

If y'all could, uh, excuse me for a minute.

Um...

It's okay.

[chuckling]

It's okay.

You know, when I was a little girl in Jacksonboro, there was a man in town.

He was a dance teacher.

He was some kind of a dago or Mexican.

Oh.

He had a name like Carlos or Antonio, but everybody called him "the tissy pretzel."

And he was a backwards bobby like you.

You're not the only one.

[chuckles]

I hear Charleston is just crawling with them these days.

You're all going to hell, you know?

Aunt Butch.

I know... that that is the very best that you're capable of.

[Mammaw]

Frank!

[footsteps approaching]

Frank.

You are my precious gift from God... and nothing... nothing will ever change that.

[trembling]

[both crying softly]

It's okay.

Oh, baby.

Your daddy was scared of it.

Always was.

You remember how much he hated your Great-Uncle Jasper?

Uncle Jasper was...?

Uh-huh. He was.

I figured that's probably why you were.

I mean, if being curly-headed is something that gets passed down, why not...

You knew?

Mothers know.

Oh, well...

Who's this?

Come here. Come here.

Come here. Come here.

Mama, this is... this is Wally.

I've wanted to meet you for so long, Mrs. Bledsoe.

And... and I'm so sorry for your loss.

Thank you.

Well, he has as much hair on his face as he does on his head, doesn't he?

[laughing]

[laughs]

I've got you something.

Mm.

A little gift from New York City.

[Mammaw] Oh...

[scoffs]

How pretty.

Well, it's nice to meet you, Wally.

Nice meeting you, too, ma'am.

And please call me Mammaw.

Mammaw.

You... You should go on and sit down now.

Honey, go. Run.

Get out.

[Mammaw]

You can sit down now.

[Neva] He is my brother.

That doesn't make it right.

It isn't wrong.

Well...

The Bible says it's a sin.

[Neva] The Bible also says that it's okay to have slaves.

And okay to, like, marry ten...

[Beau] Oh, so what, you don't believe in the Bible no more?

How you doing?

Good.

How about you?

I'm good.

[conversation continues]

[Beth] What I remember most about my Granddaddy Mac's funeral is just sitting around the backyard after everybody else had left.

[laughter]

And it was just us.

[chattering, laughter]

The sun was starting to go down.

There was a breeze.

And I remember thinking... this is where I belong.

Not like I belonged with my family.

It was bigger than that.

Like every single one of us belonged there, in that backyard, on that afternoon.

And I realized in that moment... we were all exactly where we were supposed to be.

What do you want to do?

There's nothing huge

around here.

You took your dad's car?

Just a little spin, man.

 I've been waiting

All these years 

 Somebody holds the key 

 But I'm near the end 

 And I just ain't got

The time 

 And I'm wasted

And I can't find my way home

Oh.

Shit! Get out of here!

Get out of here right now!

Shit.

Shit. Shit.

Jon, shh.

I gotta go.

This is where

you live.

This is all fucked up.

 I can't find my way home 

Hey.

I guess we

let things get...

I mean...

It's just love, man.

It's just...love.

We got carried away,

and I think we should stop.

I mean, pretty soon,

we'll be out

of high school,

and then we'll be in college,

and I want to go to college

in a big city.

You're gonna go away?

As soon as I can.

You're awake.

I just...

Um, I wanted

a drink of water.

I couldn't sleep either,

so I decided

I might as well

do something useful.

Maybe I shouldn't

stay here anymore.

I'm not innocent

in all this, Bobby.

I can't pretend to be.

I honestly don't

know what to do.

I'm supposed

to be the mother.

I'm the adult here.

And I honestly don't...

have the slightest idea

what to do or say

to either one of you.

I should go...

I guess.

Want to learn how to bake a pie?

Huh?

Sometimes it's good

to just do a simple,

useful thing.

I don't know.

Well, I haven't rolled out

the second crust yet.

It's not like

bread dough.

You mold that until

it comes to life.

Pie crust is

just the opposite.

It needs kid gloves.

You handle it

as little as possible.

You'd be surprised

how easy it is

once you learn

a few of the tricks.

Just coax it.

That's right.

That's good.

That's very good.

It was...a trip.

so much.

Hi.

I am so glad

to finally meet you.

Me too. You.

Thanks for letting me, you know,

crash here for a while.

Well, come on.

Grab your things,

get settled in.

Come, Jonathan.

Wow.

I like a little respite

from all the décor.

You want to...

go out to dinner?

You want to unpack first?

I mostly brought,

you know, records.

Let's go out.

Okay.

Have fun, boys.

JONATHAN:

You come too.

Well, I...

No.

You guys need

a little time alone,

I think.

No, really.

Come.

Okay.

I'll just put on my other eye,

and we're out of here.

you'll have the whole city

What?

You got a tattoo.

Oh.

Yeah, years ago at NYU.

I thought I could be

the kind of person

who'd have a tattoo.

Cool.

Bobby...

Uh-huh?

I feel like there are things

we should talk about...

but I'm not sure what to say.

What things?

[LAUGHS]

You know, when we were kids...

What we used to do.

Oh.

Man, we were kids.

So, um...

are you seeing anyone

in Cleveland?

Nah.

I was just, you know,

working, hanging out.

How about you?

You seeing anybody?

No.

No one in particular.

[]

Hey, man.

Look what someone

was throwing out.

Hey, Leonard C.

Right out there

on the street

along with some

dead spider plants

and macramé.

How many times

did we get stoned

to this?

I lost count.

Hey, man,

I'm making lasagna.

We could knock off

a bottle of Chianti

and listen to "Suzanne,"

like, 10 times.

Sorry, I've got

a date.

No problemo.

Save some for me.

Uh-huh.

You have to promise

to make this,

at most, once a year.

Bobby, if I weigh

300 pounds,

I won't be able

to get up the stairs.

Too bad Jonathan

has to miss it.

Well...Jonathan

has other priorities.

And it was the best.

We were out of our minds.

JONATHAN:

You had a good time?

Oh, the best.

The best.

You know how sometimes it seems

like the DJ knows you?

Uh-huh.

That's what

I'm talking about.

 Suzanne takes you down... 

This is

one of my sadness albums.

After my divorce.

You were married?

Years ago.

He was a sadistic drug addict,

and I was, um...

well, a masochistic

aspiring drug addict.

It made sense

at the time.

Where did you meet him?

Want a real laugh? Woodstock.

You were at Woodstock?

Like...the concert?

Well, I don't tell just anybody,

Bobby.

What was it like?

Muddy.

You never seen so much mud.

I felt like a pig.

I was attracted to Denny

because he had a huge bar

of Lifebuoy soap

down at the pond.

Yow.

Hey.

Have you ever heard Steve Reich?

No.

It's one of my favorites.

Listen.

I just sort of catch

to blow through.

Well, as you know,

Love that.

Jon, Jonnie,

have you heard this guy?

Steve Reich.

Oh. Sure.

He's great. He's amazing.

He's just... He's...

Where'd you find him,

anyway?

He found me.

[LAUGHS]

Well, he's

a welcome addition

to the household.

Bobby, you're gonna have to

find a job, aren't you?

Well, I'm a baker.

You think a New York bakery

would hire me?

Honey, in New York,

someone will pay you

to do just about anything.

I mean, if I can make a living

making hats...

She doesn't exactly

make a living making hats.

She picks up a little change

that way.

That is not true.

I do have some money left over

from my grandfather,

but I've stashed it away

for when the baby comes.

You're having a baby?

Didn't Jonathan

tell you?

It, uh...

It hasn't come up.

I didn't know you two were, um--

Lovers? We're not.

Most parents aren't lovers.

Mine weren't.

I know this must sound

a little...

A little what,

darling?

A little free?

A little great?

A little like insisting

on our own happiness,

even if it's not what

people ordinarily do?

Well...

Babies.

I mean, hey,

let's have a dozen.

[BOTH LAUGH]

Shit, you scared me.

Sorry, man.

What are you doing?

I get up and walk around

in the dark sometimes.

Does that

weird you out?

No.

I don't know.

When the place is all dark...

When you and Clare

have gone to sleep,

and I'm awake...

it's like being alive

and being dead

at the same time.

You know?

It's this sort of

halfway thing,

where the people who are alive

are dreaming,

and the people who are dead

are...

where they are.

And I'm here...

in the dark and the quiet.

You want some water?

Sure.

[SIGHS]

Hey...

Are you and Clare

really having a baby?

Oh, God.

I don't know.

We've been

talking about it.

It's something

she really wants.

[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

I like Clare.

So do I.

[CAR HORN HONKS]

Bye, Lacey.

See you.

We can take it from

there if we need to...

Perfect.

And on the Thursday ad--

Oh, shit, I gotta go.

Can you, uh--?

Yeah, yeah, I got it.

Thank you.

Bye, Jonathan.

Bye.

MAN:

"Don't let it worry you,"

said the cameraman.

"Even De Mille

couldn't see anything

looking through

the wrong end,"

so that was

the first--

Don't let me

kill the point.

Or isn't it a story

for grown-ups?

You've heard it.

About the time

I looked

through the wrong end

of the camera finder.

Remind me to tell you

about the time

I looked into the heart

of an artichoke.

Hey...

is your name Dirk?

No, I'm Jonathan.

Oh. I'm sorry, I just...

you look like

someone I know named Dirk.

I'm Wes.

JONATHAN: Hey, Wes.

These are my friends,

Clare...

and Bobby.

Pleasure, Wes.

Hey.

So, Jonathan,

Bobby and I'll

see you later.

I thought we were all

having dinner together.

All right.

I'll see you later.

Yow.

Do you know what I think?

Now, can Clare be

absolutely honest with you?

Uh-huh.

I think you need

a new haircut.

Really?

Mm. You're so handsome,

and that hippie do

does absolutely

nothing for you.

I don't know.

I never really,

you know,

think about it.

Well, I do.

See, here's the thing.

You don't quite

look like yourself this way.

You know

what I'm saying?

If you walk around looking like

someone other than who you are,

you could end up getting the

wrong job, the wrong friends,

who knows what all.

You could end up

with someone else's whole life.

I think this is my life.

It doesn't seem

like somebody else's.

Check.

 They can't hurt you now 

 Can't hurt you now 

 Can't hurt you now 

 Because the night

Belongs to lovers 

 Because the night

Belongs to lust 

 Because the night... 

What do you think?

I look so...

Dangerous?

Sexy?

Stripped-down,

ready for action?

That's not what I was thinking,

exactly.

Well, you are definitely

gonna start turning heads

around here now.

Bobby...

What do you like

about me?

What?

Do you...

Do you like me?

I like you.

Of course I like you.

I mean, could you...

You know, do you have...

God, I can't believe

you're gonna

make me say it.

Do you think I'm attractive?

Oh. I, uh...

That's what I thought

you were gonna ask.

And, yes, I...

Absolutely, I do.

Good.

That's good.

Well...

there's just no smooth

or sophisticated way to do this,

is there?

Clare...

Shh, shh, shh, shh.

No, listen.

You talk too much, darling,

and if you don't shut up,

I will come to my senses

and realize

how utterly stupid

and self-destructive

this is.

I have to tell you,

I've never...

you know,

done this before.

Pardon me?

I've never...

you know...

Never?

No.

Does that freak you out?

No.

I mean, yes, of course

it freaks me out!

Jesus Christ.

I guess maybe

we should stop.

Maybe.

Because, you know...

I may not be the most, like...

adept.

Oh, honey.

You think I'm upset

because you might not be adept?

Is that

what you think?

No.

I guess.

Okay...junior.

Mama's gonna teach you

a thing or two.

Are you nervous?

Uh-huh.

Don't be.

This is the most natural thing

in the world.

All right.

[GRUNTS]

[SOBBING]

It's all right.

[DOOR OPENS]

JONATHAN [MUFFLED]:

Hey!

Sorry I missed dinner.

Where is everybody?

[]

[DOOR SLAMS]

Hey.

Jonnie...

Are you okay?

Mm-hmm.

Are you okay?

I guess.

You should go back

to Clare.

Nah, man.

I don't want to

leave you alone.

I mean...

[EXHALES SLOWLY]

You should...

go back to Clare.

Really.

Bobby?

[]

Hey.

Bobby, wakey, wakey.

Oops!

I am not here.

You never saw me.

I'm just the cleaning lady.

So sorry.

You were in bed.

We tucked you in

at 2 a.m.

I went out again.

Fun?

Sort of.

Potential?

I don't think so.

[PEOPLE CONVERSING

IN HUSHED TONES]

[SIGHS]

So, what'll we

do now--? Oops.

See you later, babies.

Jonnie...

Oh, it's

entirely fine.

There's a whole world

full of art boys just outside.

Jonathan...

No worries.

Love you.

[MOZART'S "SOAVE SIA IL VENTO"

PLAYING]

Hey, man.

What are you doing

up here?

Some queen next door's

got Mozart cranked.

I couldn't

tear myself away.

Opera, huh?

Clare loves you.

I love Clare.

Doesn't this all seem

sort of strange?

No, man.

It's perfect.

Just like this.

Bobby, I'm starting

to feel a little extra.

You're essential, man.

[CHUCKLES]

Mm-mm.

Hey. Let's dance.

You can't dance

to opera.

You can dance to anything.

What are you doing?

A little kiss

between brothers.

Nothing wrong

with that.

Jon?

Jonnie?

Clare! Clare, wake up!

What?

[SIGHS]

[WHISPERS]

Jonathan...

you asshole!

God.

We gotta find him.

Honey, he isn't lost.

He left.

It's my fault.

This is not true.

No, you don't...

You don't understand.

Shh.

Bobby, this is a problem

of Jonathan's.

Trust me.

There's something

fucked up about me.

There is nothing fucked up

about you.

You don't know.

ALICE: Hello?

Hi, Alice?

Bobby,

is that you, honey?

Listen,

I don't want to worry you,

but I was wondering,

have you heard from Jonathan?

Oh, yeah, of course.

He's right here.

Do you want

to talk to him?

He's there?

Great. Yeah, put him on.

Bobby, I'm sorry.

It looks like he's

gone to bed already,

but I'll tell him

you called, okay?

Tell him Clare and I

are fine, okay?

Okay, sweetheart,

I will.

Bye-bye.

[DUNCAN SHEIK'S

"SOMETHING SOMEWHERE" PLAYING]

 Still, you're near 

 Still, you call 

 The fears and sighs 

 I hear them all 

 Like those Christmastimes 

 When we would not sleep 

 Just lay there

Warm and proud 

 All your wishes

For something somewhere 

 And it's never far 

 Oh, what all we were 

 All that's changing now 

 All your wishes

For something somewhere 

 Through this different town 

 With its different streets 

 Still, the thought of you 

Do you like it here?

Well...

here I can...

more or less,

breathe the air.

And your mother's

learned

how to make

blue margaritas.

[LABORED BREATHING]

Whoever expected to end up

living in the desert?

Yeah, whoever expects

to end up living anywhere?

That's...too deep for me.

 Something somewhere 

 And what's left behind 

 When each evening ends? 

 Roads to where we've been 

 All your wishes... 

How's that?

Looks a little bit

like me, doesn't it?

[TELEPHONE RINGING]

We're not speaking

to anybody right now.

[ANSWERING MACHINE CLICKS]

BOBBY'S VOICE:

Happy holidays.

Celebrate,

all you people.

[MACHINE BEEPS]

ALICE:

Hello, Bobby.

This is Alice.

Sweetheart, there's something

I have to tell you.

 All your wishes

For something somewhere 

Oh, look at you.

And this is Clare.

Oh, Clare.

So wonderful

to finally meet you.

Thanks for coming.

Thank you

for having me.

Alice, sorry.

[DISHES CLATTERING]

Alice?

So clumsy.

I'll get it.

Oh, it's all right.

They cost $1.at K-Mart.

Oh...

[DISH SHATTERS]

Alice?

Do something for me.

Anything.

Hold me.

Just hold me.

Okay.

Tighter.

Don't be gentle with me.

Squeeze me harder.

Harder.

Make me feel like

you're breaking my ribs.

Oh, God...

I can't.

I don't wanna hurt you.

I love you.

You're an angel.

JONATHAN: Mom?

I'll be right there,

honey.

JONATHAN:

Anybody want a drink?

BOBBY: Okay, sure.

CLARE: Okay.

Hey.

I'm sorry about--

Well...all this.

I, uh...

I knew I'd see you both again.

I just imagined...

well...

different circumstances.

It's okay.

It's okay.

Ned, man.

He was a trip.

He was like

my father too.

You would have

loved him, Clare.

CLARE:

I'm sure.

Bobby?

If you want my family so badly,

I hereby bequeath them to you.

No. No, better yet,

I hereby bequeath you

my whole, entire life.

Be me.

I hereby dub you

Jonathan Glover.

Tomorrow, when they cremate

my father's body,

you can be the son,

and I'll be

the best friend.

You can come back

from the service

and you can console my mother.

Jonathan, stop it.

Stop it.

You're better at it than I am.

You're better qualified.

So go, go at it.

Be their son,

with my blessings.

Listen to me,

you little shit.

All he's ever done

is worship you,

and all you've ever done

is walk out on him.

Don't you dare

speak to him like that,

you hear me?

You don't know

what you're talking about.

You don't know the first thing

about worship.

Do you know?

Do you have any idea

how much I...

Listen, you guys--

How much

I wanted you?

How much I loved you,

you asshole?

You know?

And then, what an idiot I am,

how pathetic is that?

Me in love

with you.

And then Bobby

comes along,

and I fall in love

with this one,

and then I think

that we...

That the three of us,

maybe we could...

[SOBS]

Fuck it.

JONATHAN: Clare?

Just leave me alone

and go back to the house

and have a drink.

Clare!

Clare...

How could you?

Just leave

without saying anything?

I couldn't be

the uncle anymore.

Give me a break, okay?

Clare, hey...

Don't call me that.

What? Don't call

you what? Your name?

What did you think

I would do

without you,

Jonathan?

What were you

thinking?

BOBBY:

Oh, Clare, come on.

I'm pregnant, you fuckers!

What?

Are-- Are you sure?

I'm completely sure.

You wanted this.

Didn't you?

God help me.

Clare... Oh, man.

You think?

Yes.

Yes.

[LAUGHING AND CRYING]

[]

JONATHAN: What do you think

about "Ethan" for a boy?

Or "Trevor"?

CLARE: Let's not

get too fancy.

If it's a girl,

let's call her "Clare, Jr."

One Clare per family

is enough, thank you.

What's the kid gonna

call Bobby and me?

Oh, I never

thought of that.

"Daddy," I suppose.

Like, "Daddy One"

and "Daddy Two?"

 Oooooh-oooh-ooh 

 Oooooh-oooh-ooh 

 Oooooh-oooh-ooh 

 Oooooh 

CLARE: We're gonna

have to move, aren't we?

JONATHAN: Right.

Funny family

will need a third bedroom.

Frankly,

I think funny family

may need a whole

new neighborhood.

JONATHAN:

Somewhere where two

out of three people passing by

are not actively psychotic?

Exactly.

BOBBY:

How about Cleveland?

No!

No!

BOBBY:

Let's move here.

Please repeat

what you just said.

It's too hard to raise

a kid in the city.

Don't you think?

But what if the kid

turned out to be

some sort of,

I don't know, Heidi.

I mean, how much

goodness do we want?

Growing up in the country

doesn't doom anyone

to good behavior.

Most of the really

interesting murderers

come from derelict

farms.

This is so adult,

looking at real estate.

We are adults,

sort of.

JONATHAN:

Who would the kid play with

way out here?

CLARE:

Maybe woodland creatures,

like Snow White did.

I don't want him hanging

around with squirrels.

They have personality

disorders.

CLARE:

Stop it!

This one has a great soul.

Don't you

think?

Baby?

It's your money.

It's my grandfather's money.

I didn't earn a dime of it.

Still...

you'd be the owner.

What do you think?

You really want this,

don't you?

Um...if you do.

If we all do.

No, you, Bobby Morrow.

Beautiful, crazy boy.

You want this,

and I could get it for you.

No, it'd be

for us.

[DUSTY SPRINGFIELD'S

"WISHIN' AND HOPIN'" PLAYING]

So long,

treasures.

 Wishin' and hopin'

And thinkin' and prayin' 

 Plannin' and dreamin'

Each night of his charms 

 That won't get you

Into his arms 

 So if you're looking

To find love you can share 

 All you gotta do is hold him

And kiss him and love him 

 And show him that you care 

 Show him that you care

Just for him 

[DOOR OPENS]

I'm thinking white here.

Totally white,

like a Shinto shrine,

and somewhere we can hang

paper lanterns all over.

You are the gayest

living human being ever.

Somebody's gotta be gay

around here.

What do you like,

Bobby?

I think I'm gonna go...

and fix a window.

Okay, Jonathan...

blue is your friend.

See, blue is the color

of sky and water.

Yeah, but white goes

with everything.

Yes, well, honey,

it's a house,

not an outfit.

 So if you're thinkin'

Of how great true love is 

 All you gotta do is hold him

And kiss him and squeeze him 

 And love him 

 Yeah, just do it

And after you do 

 You will be his 

 You will be his 

 You will be his 

[BABY CRYING]

It's all right.

I'll do it.

No, sleep. It's my night.

It's okay.

Bobby's doing it.

It's his night.

If we don't keep

to the schedule,

you know,

then we'll all

be exhausted

by tomorrow.

I don't care.

I miss my daughter.

BOBBY:

Guess nobody's

sleeping tonight.

JONATHAN:

Hello, Rebecca.

Hello.

Oh.

Aw.

Oh...

Oh, sweetie...

[COOING]

Who's a girl?

[HONKS]

Hey, beauties

and heroes.

Where have you been?

Come with me.

I got something

to show you.

This town's crying out

for a cool, little café.

CLARE:

This town's crying out

for an outlet mall.

[JONATHAN & CLARE LAUGH]

What?

It has possibilities.

Where?

Point out

a possibility.

Kitchen's

basically okay.

Just needs

a good cleaning.

Look, wood

floors.

Is that a termite?

No--

Oh, uh, yeah,

maybe.

I think I got a name.

"The Home Café."

What do you think?

Well, it'd be

better for business

than "The Squalor

and Desperation Café,"

I suppose.

And the goddess said,

"Feed the people

and send them out happy

into the night."

How's that mushroom lasagna

holding up?

Two more orders left.

Save 'em

for Martha and Gill.

No problem.

You got 'em, my dears.

Thanks,

Jonathan.

[BABY CRYING]

We're home, dear.

Oh, she's not

happy today.

For a full hour.

I have no idea.

Oh, hey, honey.

Aw.

Just feeling shitty?

I think she's

getting sick.

I gotta get dressed

and get back to the restaurant.

Yeah, and I

have to, well,

pick up some toys.

You okay?

Never better.

[CARTOON VOICE]

Come on.

I seem to have ended up

the mother and the wife,

haven't I?

That's not fair.

No, that's not fair.

And I can't help that.

[DOOR OPENS]

I thought you'd be

out here.

I'm sorry.

You haven't

done anything.

I just want everybody

to be happy.

I know you do.

It won't always be like this.

We're, you know,

still getting started.

Bobby, what if I...

just couldn't do this?

It'll be okay.

Trust me.

You know, I think maybe

I'm not...this unusual.

I think maybe

it's just my hair.

[QUIETLY]

I love your hair.

Come here.

Oh, Bobby.

Oh, mamacita!

Here you are.

Oh, look what you've done.

Our little place.

Oh, it's beautiful.

Oh, that's Ned and me.

Where did you find this?

Oh, it's lovely,

all of it.

Oh.

I want to see

the kitchen.

Come on.

ALICE:

Oh, I love it!

CLARE: So here it is.

Yasgur's Farm.

The holy ground itself.

It's hard

to believe

all that went on

here, isn't it?

It just

looks like...

Mud puddle

and a field of cow pies?

I know.

Come on in,

you people!

No.

I have been

in that water before--

Bobby, don't you dare

put her in there!

[SMALL SPLASH]

[LAUGHS]

Boys, give 'em

a puddle to play in...

ALICE:

They're sweet together,

aren't they?

In their gooney way.

I think

you're very brave.

You do?

Yeah.

When I was

your age,

you got married,

and you had a family.

Never occurred to you

to do anything else.

Well, you know, I wanted that.

I wanted...

just a more normal thing,

when I was younger.

Just wanted a husband

and a baby and...

I think maybe you're better off.

Really.

One minute you think

you have everything

you ever wanted,

and the next you...

find yourself

in some suburban neighborhood

somewhere...

and it's fine.

I mean, it's not not fine.

It's just...

The world just...

starts to shrink

around you somehow.

Most women

have absolutely no idea

what they're getting into.

No.

I don't suppose anyone knows

what they're getting into...

till they're into it.

[REBECCA LAUGHING]

[DOOR OPENS]

Whoops.

For God's sake.

Hey, what's up?

A little privacy, please.

You never wanted

privacy before.

You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

What's that?

It's nothing.

Come here.

It's...

[VOICE QUAVERING]

one of those spots,

I think.

Nah, man.

It's a bruise.

Maybe.

Absolutely.

Will you...

Will you do something for me?

Sure.

Don't tell them.

I can't--

If I'm sick--

You're not sick.

I-- Well, just promise me that,

then, okay?

If it's just a bruise--

It is a bruise.

If I just bumped my hip,

then there's no reason

to mention it, okay?

It is a bruise.

Okay, there is no reason

to talk about it.

Yeah.

Okay.

Okay.

All right.

[KNOCKING]

Mom, is that--?

Your father's ashes.

I thought there'd be

a right moment,

and now suddenly

if I don't give 'em

to you right now,

I'm gonna have to take them

back to Phoenix with me.

He wouldn't

have wanted them

scattered in Arizona.

I thought maybe

we could scatter them here.

Here?

Well, this is

your home, isn't it?

I guess.

You know,

I think it might be best

just to be done with it.

He was a...

A modest man.

He wouldn't have wanted

an elaborate ceremony.

Mom.

And I can

tell you this.

This is no more him

than a pair

of his old shoes.

Not yet. I'm...

Not here, not now.

I'm... I'm not ready.

Well...whenever you are.

We should go.

Okay.

I love you, honey.

I love you too.

BOBBY: I'll see you

at the café.

ALICE: Bye!

[LAUGHING]

Oh, no, did you

get yourself dirty?

Did you?

You got yourself

so dirty.

I need powder.

Did you get yourself

dirty?

I know you did.

You're so sexy

like this.

And you are

a true pervert.

Get me the powder.

Who's a girl?

Who's a girl?

What happened?

You got something

on your face.

Here, let me.

Hey.

[GURGLES]

[LAUGHS]

You can do anything,

can't you?

Me? Nah.

I mean it. You can live

in the suburbs,

in the East Village,

you can live in the country,

and it just doesn't make

any difference to you, does it?

I don't know.

I never really think about it.

There you go.

All done.

Come on.

Thanks.

Come here.

Sit up there, princess.

You are a strange

and mysterious creature.

I'm, like, the least

mysterious one around here.

I'll bet you could live

in the Sahara.

I bet you could

just pitch a tent

and find someone

to sell you a camel.

[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

I mean it.

Is there anything

you couldn't do?

I couldn't be alone.

No.

No, you couldn't, could you?

about it.

No worries, please.

gone away?

Well, no.

Let me see.

It's the same.

Let me see.

Can be replaced 

 Yes, every distance

Is not near 

See?

It's the same.

No, man.

It's fading.

 So I remember every face 

You really think so?

Absolutely.

 Of every man

Who put me here 

 I see my light come shining 

 Come shining

You want to dance?

What?

Come on.

 Any day now 

 I shall be released

 Whoa, oh 

 Oh, oh, yeah

 In this lonely crowd 

 Is a man who swears

He's not to blame 

 All day long, I hear him 

 Cry so loud

That he's been framed 

 He's been framed 

 I see my light 

 I see my light

 I shall be 

 I shall be released

Jonathan?

Mm. Hi.

Ow.

I was so in love with you.

I was in love with you too.

But Bobby

is the love of your life.

You know it's not that simple.

It's just that...

I seem to have ended up...

Come to bed.

I can't sleep.

Do you want me

to get up?

No.

Go back to sleep.

Good night, crazy mama.

It'll all seem better

in the morning.

Gonna miss you.

Oh, it's just a few days.

You're taking

a lot of stuff.

Well, she needs

a lot of stuff.

Okay, I think

we're all set.

So...

Bobby...

Uh-huh?

Do you want

to come with us?

I can't.

Bobby...

Do you want to come with us?

No.

[SOFTLY]

Okay.

Okay.

Call me.

I will.

Okay?

Yeah.

JONATHAN:

You're a brave woman,

visiting your mother

all alone.

Ugh.

She's not alone.

She's got Rebecca

with her.

Now...

[KISSES REBECCA]

Don't worry, Miss R.

[REBECCA CRYING]

The best thing

about Philadelphia

is you can leave it,

and we'll be waiting

for you right here

when you come home.

If you're lucky, and good,

we'll have a special surprise

waiting for you

when you get back.

Lovey. Lovey.

Boys...

Uh-huh?

Be good.

Always.

Love you.

 Oooh-oooh 

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]

You sleeping, man?

I can't, really.

They're not coming back,

you know.

This is a good spot,

don't you think?

Yeah, I do.

You think we should,

like, say a few words?

We got this far, Dad.

I think you'd like it.

I really do.

Amen.

I should've

written something.

No, man.

This is perfect.

Anyway, Dad, here we are.

It's our place,

and it's yours too.

Okay.

Now.

One...

two...

three.

YOUNG JONATHAN:

What's that?

YOUNG BOBBY:

Windowpane.

For clarity of vision.

If something bad

happens,

tell my parents

I tried to be good,

but it was

just too hard.

You're not freaked out

about the graveyard?

I mean, don't be.

The dead are just people too.

People who wanted

the same things we want.

What do we want?

I don't know, man.

I mean, our lives, right?

Man, like, this whole big,

beautiful, noisy world,

and everything that can happen.

Uh-oh.

All's well, little brother.

Your folks love you.

I love you.

Nothing to fear.

BOBBY:

I've been thinking.

We should repaint

Rebecca's room.

Like, pink.

She'd like that.

Don't you think?

Okay.

She'll come back

someday...

to this house, I mean.

It'll be hers.

I guess it will be.

She probably

won't want it, right?

She probably

won't have any idea

what to do with it.

But still,

it'll be hers, you know?

It'll be hers.

Listen...

this will be

an all right place

to put my ashes too,

okay?

Sure.

I mean...

whatever you want.

You built us

a very good home.

That's not what--

That's what you did.

That's what you did

for me, you know?

It's funny,

isn't it?

What?

The big, beautiful,

noisy world.

Everything

that can happen.

Yeah.

It's funny.

 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 

 You took your love and

Left me quite by surprise 

 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 

 You can be sure that now 

 It's gonna take a miracle 

 Yes, it's gonna

Take a miracle 

 Yes, it's gonna

Take a miracle 

 Yes, it's gonna

Take a miracle 

 Yes, it's gonna

Take a miracle 

[DUNCAN SHEIK'S "THERE'S A HOME"

PLAYING]

 So my friend 

 We're left out

On our own again 

 Oh, yeah, but who knows

Where we're going 

 Come, we'll walk the night

We'll listen 

 To all of those

No longer with us 

 Calling

From some lonely distance 

 Take my hand, come on

And on we'll go 

 Take my hand 

 Something's lasted 

 There's a home 

 So my friend 

 We'll head out

With our hopes again 

 Oh, yeah, we'll face

Whatever's thrown us 

 Come, we'll walk

We'll find what lingers 

 Of the things

That might have been there 

 Other dreams

Of other winters 

 Take my hand 

 Come on, and on we'll go 

 Take my hand 

 Bury the laughter 

 There with tears

We've known 

 Trailing our shadows 

 You and me, on this road 

 Built of sadness 

 There's a home 

 And it's our home 

 Bury the laughter 

 There

With tears we've known 

 You and me, shadows 

 There's a home 

 Traveling this long road 

 Built of sadness 

 There's a home 

 For what's happened 

 Something's lasted 

 There's a home 

 It's our home 

 Now we're home 

# Christopher and his kind

This programme contains

very strong language

This programme contains scenes

of a sexual nature

It's 40 years since I first wrote

about my time in Berlin,

and the book I'm now writing is

perhaps an attempt to set the

record as straight as possible.

I destroyed my Berlin diaries,

you see, so have had to rely

a good deal on memory.

As to why I went in the first place,

my friend Wystan Auden was there

and encouraged me to join him.

I could also say I went because

of what was happening politically.

But, in fact, I went

because of the boys.

To me, Berlin meant boys.

Danke schon, mein Liebling.

One man has hands that are tender

One man has hands that are strong

If I should choose to surrender

My choices are bound to be wrong

I might find my ideal lover

If I search both far and wide... 

But, my dear, that simply won't do.

You're the very last

person who ought to go there.

Berlin isn't the right

place for you at all.

What on Earth do you mean?

It's German, darling.

Wystan Auden thinks it's

the most marvellous place.

Auden! Such an untidy boy!

And, besides, what

about medical school?

But, Mummy, I am not

cut out for medical school.

That's exactly what you

said about Cambridge!

Really, Christopher, you cannot

go through life shirking it.

It's time you buckled to.

I'm a published novelist!

Of course you are, darling,

but wouldn't it be so much

nicer to be a doctor, as well?

It isn't a hobby, you know?

Any normal mother would be proud.

And I am proud, my sweetheart.

You know I found your

novel most interesting.

I thought it was ingenious the way

you used your antipathy towards me

to such creative effect.

But you cannot expect life

to be one long holiday.

I'm not going there on holiday,

I'm going there to get away from you.

Couldn't you go somewhere a little

closer, like the Isle of Wight?

Mother!

I don't know to whom I belong

It would be such

a shame to end up on my own

If I make myself true to one

How another will surely be sad

and alone

Of course, you must do as you wish.

I fully intend to.

It's only natural, I suppose, that

you should want to flee the nest,

just as I am bound

to get more lonely.

When I think of what I went through

to bring you into this world!

Months and months of

feeling really quite seedy.

Oh well, so be it.

You won't forget, will you, darling,

that the Germans killed your father?

MACHINE GUNS

Take me with you.

You have to stay

and look after Mummy.

But for how long?

I'm afraid I can't answer that.

If I make myself true to one

How another

will surely be sad and alone

Should such a beauty

belong to one person?

No, surely, the sun

and the stars

They belong to us all

I don't know

To whom I belong

I believe

I only belong to myself. 

APPLAUSE

Danke. Vielen Dank.

I was wondering...

Oh, do forgive me, dear boy.

I didn't mean to startle you.

No, no.

Could I trouble you for a light?

Yes, of course.

I seem to have mislaid my

lighter, I suspect it...

Thank you, dear boy.

It may have been...

Would you mind if I...?

No, no. How kind!

It may have been stolen. Oh dear.

One has to be so careful

nowadays, don't you find?

Are you going all the way?

Excuse me? To Berlin?

Yes.

Holiday? I'm hoping for

a little more than that.

Ah, yes.

Well, Berlin has so much to

offer, in certain respects.

Do you live there? For now.

One never knows what

a new dawn may bring.

I hope you don't think I'm prying,

dear boy, but do you have

accommodation in Berlin?

I do, as it happens, yes.

The reason why I venture such

impertinence is that my landlady,

dear, sweet woman,

is desperate for a reliable lodger.

Her landlords are ruthless

and if they knew she didn't

have the full quota,

well, turf her out in an instant.

I have a feeling, and though

perhaps I shouldn't say so myself,

I do have a nose for these things.

You might fit the bill perfectly.

My goodness, yes. Well, that's

most kind of you, but as I say...

I'll tell her, then, shall I?

Here's my card. Mr Hamilton.

Oh, Gerald, please.

And who shall I tell her to expect?

Isherwood.

Christopher Isherwood.

ANNOUNCEMENT ON TANNOY

Wystan!

So, here I am! Yes, here you are.

Good trip?

Fine, thanks.

Those seats are devilish.

I hardly noticed.

I thought we'd drop your case off,

then I'd show you the sights.

Best start as one means to go on.

I decided the Brandenburg Gate

could wait.

Don't worry, they won't bite,

unless you want them to.

They're very accommodating if you

have the cash, but it won't break

the bank, the exchange rate is

still very much in our favour.

Ah, Pieps! Hallo.

IN GERMAN

Guten Abend. Guten Abend. Niedlich!

What are you saying?

What was that?

We've been something of a feature.

Well, maybe more of a B feature.

I have no illusions of the

pitfalls of loving a whore.

Are they all on the game?

Most of them, yes. You can't imagine

what a state the economy's in.

They look very well on it.

Yeah, they like to

keep themselves fit.

It's good for business, of course,

and they're shamelessly vain.

The fact that we find them

desirable only proves how

very masculine they are.

What do you mean, "we"?

They're nearly all rampant heters

and use our money to pay for cunt.

But don't let that put you off,

they're frightfully good at it.

What name does he go under?

Caspar.

That's about the only

thing I understood.

Perhaps you'd better help me

trot out the odd German phrase,

else I could get myself

into the most frightful fix.

Perhaps I better had.

The question is, will you

understand the answers?

I might have found somewhere to stay.

Oh, yes? I got talking to this

man on the train. You little slut!

apparently his landlady's

rather desperate for a lodger.

Something about filling her quota.

Anyway, I thought there'd be

no harm in checking it out.

You're very welcome

to stay here, you know.

In fact I'd

very much like it if you did.

I need a room of my own, Wystan.

Once I start giving

lessons, which I'm going

to have to earn a bit of cash

and subsidise my writing, well...

And you can't write

poetry with me buzzing about.

Yes, you're right.

So, I expect you'll be seeing

him again, this Caspar chappie?

Well, yes. I hope so.

I have missed you.

I love English

gentlemen, Herr Issyvoo.

Herr Hamilton, such a charming man!

And you, a writer! What an honour!

You can

write many famous novels here.

Oh, Herr Issyvoo,

this room was made for you!

It's very nice, Fraulein Thurau.

Oh, Herr Issyvoo!

You English are so polite.

Well, you English men.

There is an English

woman across the hall.

She treats me like a slave.

"Fraulein Ross,"

I tell her, "I was a lady. I have

not always scrubbed the floors."

Ach, forgive me, Herr Issyvoo,

that was the lodger before you.

I don't know what he'd eaten

but it won't come out.

THEY SPEAK GERMAN

Morning, darling. I have

the most perfectly frightful head.

Who is it? Isherwood.

Who? Christopher Isherwood.

It's me, Christopher.

We met on the train.

I've taken the room.

Oh, Christopher!

Do forgive me, dear boy,

one has to be so careful nowadays.

Since my release from Brixton

I've rather lost touch with

the old country.

You were in prison? Yes, for

expressing anti-British sentiments,

though how, I ask myself,

could I be regarded as a traitor

when I have rivers of Irish blood

simply coursing through my veins?

So you're in business here?

One must have

fingers in many pies, dear boy.

Such alarming times we live in.

Ah! Heinrich! A young stevedore

I encountered in Hamburg.

And what were you doing in Hamburg?

What is one ever doing anywhere?

Passing through, dear boy.

That is our destiny,

forever passing through.

He does make rather an impression,

though, doesn't he? Well, I...

I have found, Christopher,

down the years, that I have

never been able to relax sexually

with a member of my own class.

That an affair with one's social and

intellectual equal is

well nigh impossible, mm?

I suppose.

You are in the right city, dear boy.

Quite the place to let your hair

down with some eager young prole.

Oh, dear, is it crooked?

Just a tiny bit, perhaps. Of course,

one must take a little care.

We're still illegal,

and should the Nazis come to power

they'll stamp us out altogether.

What's the current Communist line?

Well, as far as I know, Lenin

said nothing about buggery.

Dearest Heinrich!

Smelt exactly like a fox.

Delicious!

Haven't you gone yet, Ludo?

Oh, do put something on!

You'll frighten the horses.

He's Polish.

"He noticed I was staring at his

wig and asked if it was crooked.

"'Just a little', I said,

and he straightened it."

You like, ja? Ja. Spot on.

GASPING

Window. Good.

Good. Ah.

And this?

Fish. No, what is it?

Big fish?

No, this. What is this?

Whale.

No. It's a clock.

Clock! Ja!

Yes, good. And that's a dolphin.

Was? Never mind.

That...Fraulein Schmidt?

Well, what is that?

SHE LAUGHS

GASPING AND MOANING

Oh, Christoph! Oh!

This is how I'd like to die.

Ist gut? Ja? Ja, ja!

Guten Morgen, Herr Hamilton!

Oh, Guten Morgen, Fraulein Mayr.

Guten Morgen.

Danke.

ROARING BEHIND DOOR

Guten Morgen, Herr Issyvoo.

Guten Morgen, Fraulein Thurau.

How sweet love must be!

Tonight, yes?

Jawohl.

Morning, darling.

Of course I don't know half the

people who pass through this place,

but you've been here simply

generations.

I thought we really must say hello.

Would you like coffee or tea?

Well... I don't recommend the tea

much.

I don't know what Fraulein

Thurau does to it,

but it tastes just like slops.

Tell me, Chris, what do you do?

People tend not to call me Chris. I'm

an actress. Not at the moment.

I'm singing in a night club. But

you absolutely must come and see me.

What about tonight? I'm afraid

tonight's rather difficult.

Was that your boyfriend in

the hall or just a one off?

I find one offs so much less

of a hassle, don't you, darling?

I've been here for centuries,

getting on three months now.

I came here with a girlfriend who

assured me we'd get film work,

but then she was whisked off

to Paris by a fat banker and

left me utterly stranded.

How rotten. Oh, I don't care.

I can stand on my own two feet.

But don't you mind being here alone?

One's always alone, duckie.

Surely you know that.

How old are you?

I'm practically antique.

I'm nearly 21.

I'm frightfully bright, you know.

I got myself expelled from

school by saying I was pregnant.

There was the most terrible to

do when they found out I wasn't.

I got myself sent down

from Cambridge. I say!

Flunked my Tripos.

What a hoot!

I'm meeting a man in

The Adlon for lunch,

but he'll have to wait.

He has the most revolting

underpants, they're

like camel hair or something.

It's the sort of thing

John The Baptist might wear.

Oh, Mummy would nearly die

if she knew what an old whore I am,

but one has to keep that horrid

wolf from the door, doesn't one?

Guten Tag!

Really!

How do you manage, darling?

I've started giving English lessons,

but actually I'm a novelist.

A novelist! How perfectly

marvellous! Are you published?

My first novel, yes. I haven't yet

found a publisher for the second.

Has it sold simply thousands?

About 300, actually.

The one you write about me

shall sell by the million.

About you? Of course, darling.

Jean Ross, woman of mystery!

I'm not sure you're that mysterious.

Do you know, I think we're

going to get along famously.

You will write about

me, won't you darling?

Maybe.

One can't afford to wait, sweetie.

This whole thing is about

to collapse around our ears.

Carpe diem, darling!

Oh, damn!

I suppose I'd better

meet the old goat.

He's promised to introduce me

to Max Reinhardt, but I don't

believe him for a second.

Why are men always

such beasts, darling?

Chris, could you be an angel and

lend me 10 marks?

I haven't got a bean for the taxi.

"She said his underpants

were like camel hair,

"the sort of thing John The

Baptist might wear."

You're very quiet.

A touch of sunstroke.

You know, coming to Berlin

is the first honest thing

I've done in my life,

and it's all thanks to you.

I doubt your mother

sees it quite like that.

He's rather lovely, don't you think?

Caspar!

So tell me, Herr Isherwood,

have you come to Berlin

to sample the culture?

I wouldn't quite say that.

In fact, I'm rather anti-culture.

Like the Nazis?

Oh, no, not in that way.

It's just that I'm rather put off

by culture worshippers.

I find them somewhat

precious and prone to gushing.

Do you find me somewhat precious

and prone to gushing?

No, I'm sure you're not,

but the danger is that one

can use culture worship

as a substitute for engaging

with the messy business of living.

You see, I find all this so very

interesting, that you are a writer

but do not like culture.

It is my belief that culture

raises us from the beasts.

I wonder, Herr Landauer, why you have

employed me to teach you English.

You seem to speak it perfectly well.

One has to... How do you say?

..keep in practice.

Good. What exactly is it that you do?

I am a shopkeeper.

A shopkeeper?

That is precisely what I am.

As in Landauer's Department Store?

Yes.

That's where I buy my socks.

Do you engage with politics,

Herr Isherwood? Actually, no.

I'm not really a joiner. I seem to

be constitutionally incapable of

bringing myself to the required...

pitch of enthusiasm.

I have my sympathies, of course.

We can no longer afford

the luxury of sympathy.

I rather suspect I'm best equipped

to observe and record.

That will not be an option.

When the Nazis come to power,

we must take to the streets.

Not only Jews like myself,

but all of us, Herr Isherwood.

We must take to the streets

and stay there, even when

the Storm Troopers start firing.

I'm not sure I'd hack

it as a street fighter.

Forgive me, but are you not then

as guilty as your detested

culture worshippers

for refusing to engage

with the whole messy business?

I think, maybe, we should

all play to our strengths.

Perhaps we will practise

the irregular verbs?

You like that, huh?

It's like silk.

If you go to gymnasium,

Christoph, you be like me

and Johnny Weissmuller.

I'm not so sure about that.

And then you do this, ja?

No! No! Caspar!

Stop! Stop! Stop!

You like, ja? Nein! Ja?

Nein! Ja! Ja!

Christoph?

Yes? You got 10 marks?

Yes.

YODELLING

I pay you tonight, ja?

Of course you will.

Oh, dear!

Let us thank God, Christoph,

that we are both normal.

Aren't boys marvellous?

Their shape and their voices,

their smell and the way they move.

And they can be so...

romantic,

whereas girls...

No, I'm glad I'm like I am.

Thank God for public school!

He's not coming, is he?

As I've told you, my dear,

intimacy's just business to them.

So you think if I

stopped giving him money...?

No, no, Caspar and I,

it's more than just business.

They're desperate for cash

and they'll do anything for it.

But what he says to me... He'll

tell you anything you want to hear.

Still, what do I know about romance?

I'm a poet, not

a fucking journalist.

I've booked my ticket

back to England. Already?

Father's allowance has dried up

and I really must get this

fissure in my rectum seen to.

I hope that wasn't me.

I'm touched by your concern,

but really, Christopher,

you mustn't flatter yourself.

Can't imagine why I

chose to leave him

How could I have been so cruel?

After all

he loved me without question

Still I left him like a fool

If I woke him late

at night complaining

"I'm on my last cigarette"

He'd say "I'll be

over in a minute

"Darling, please don't get upset"

Peter, Peter... 

Gute Nacht. Gute Nacht.

That's not what I was expecting at

all. I suspect that's a compliment,

so thank you, darling.

Oh, I'm so thrilled you're here.

Bobby, sweetie. Good job, hon!

Oh, I'm in heaven! Chris

darling, this is Bobby Gilbert.

He does something frantically

important in something or other.

I'm in steel.

And this is Chris Isherwood.

Christopher. Hey, Chris.

Any day now Bobby's going

to whisk me off to Hollywood,

aren't you, darling? You bet!

And I've told him all about you. Oh?

Chris is absolutely my best friend.

He's the writer. Oh, yeah, right!

Would I have read anything

of yours, Chris?

Oh, no, but I've told him if he

really sticks at it,

he could write something

really great like

Noel Coward or something.

Couldn't you, darling?

What's the matter, Christoph?

You don't like me tonight?

Eh, Christoph? What's the matter?

I don't like being taken for an

idiot, that's what's the matter.

You say you'll meet me,

then don't turn up.

You take money off me and say

you'll pay me back, but never do.

It's getting to the point where I

can't believe anything you tell me.

Yes, I understand. I understand.

Some of the girls I see,

they are like that.

They say things, then let me

down, and that makes me mad.

And when I see them, I always

pay them and never hit them

and still they let me down!

But you know, Christoph, some of

them, they are so beautiful,

and they make me so happy

and I just forget how mad I am.

You bastard!

Your eyes, Christoph.

They shine so bright

when you're hot for me.

Ah, Caspar. He gave

me a cheap gold-plated bracelet.

Probably an unwanted

gift from some admirer.

He fastened it around my wrist.

A love token, I fondly thought,

but then he disappeared.

I asked around, but no-one

knew where he was.

I should've listened to Wystan.

Perhaps it was just a

business transaction after all.

Zwei Minuten, meine Liebe.

It must be simply marvellous

to be a novelist. Why's that?

Because when people are utterly

foul to you, you can sit

down and write about them

and tell the world how perfectly

vile they are and make simply

pots of money out of it.

It hasn't quite worked out

like that yet.

Darling, be an angel

and light my ciggie.

Actually, I've been offered the

chance to earn a bit extra. Take it.

Writing the occasional letter from

Berlin and doing the odd book review.

Darling, that's marvellous!

Let's have champagne!

It's for a magazine called Action.

Oswald Mosley's rag?

Oh, you know it then?

Of course I know it.

I may wear green nail varnish,

but I'm not completely vacuous.

Why DO you wear green nail varnish?

Have you said yes? Not yet.

You won't. I wouldn't write

anything political.

Writing anything for that lot would

be making a statement of sorts,

even if it was the cookery column.

The money would come in awfully

handy. Christopher, you can't!

But, Jean... I wouldn't talk to you

again and that's an end to it.

I was just testing the water.

I wasn't really going to

write anything for them.

Honestly, I wasn't.

I'm one to talk. Gosh, you know

the things I've done for money.

People here are so strange.

They've simply no idea,

and the Nazis are getting

more and more of a foothold

and they just seem to accept it.

I've even heard some

talk of a brighter future

as if all this ghastliness

were a price worth paying.

They're going to get the most awful

shock unless they make a stand,

Which you and I must do.

We must not throw in the towel.

Why are you looking at me like that?

I don't really know.

WHIPPING, CRIES OF PAIN

Mein Gott!

Morning, darlings. Gott im Himmel!

HE CRIES OUT

Oh, dear! I do hope he

won't do himself a mischief.

He ought to be more careful

at his time of life.

HE CRIES OUT

Oh, Bobby darling!

You do that so well.

You must teach me one day

how to catch it in my mouth.

You bet, honey.

Thank you. To The Memorial.

The Memorial.

Yeah! So, do you reckon

I'd enjoy your book, Chris?

Well, I'm not sure what sort

of books you like, Bobby.

What do you think, hon?

I haven't a clue, darling, but I

expect it's astoundingly brilliant!

And the point is, it's published.

His second novel in print,

and he's even had a

letter of congratulation

from EM Forester. Forster. Wow!

It won't be long till our

Chris is just as famous.

Say, who's that guy in the wig?

BOTH: Gerald.

Well, I could swear that Gerald

was peeking through the keyhole

while I was in the john.

When I came out, he didn't know

where to look.

I expect he knew

exactly where to look.

Yeah. Right.

Bobby, darling. I adore champagne.

We'll have it every day, won't we,

once you' whisk me off to Hollywood?

Sure thing.

Bobby! Naughty Bobby!

SHOUTING

GLASS SMASHES

Excuse me.

Entschuldigung, bitte.

I was in a cafe and you were...

Do you remember?

No. Well, why should you?

Mein Name ist Christopher.

Perhaps you'd like

to go for ein Bier?

No. OK.

I'm sorry.

His name was Heinz. He was innocent,

vulnerable and uncritical.

A boy I could protect and

cherish as my very own.

Jean thought it was all frightfully

jolly and decided I was at last doing

my bit for the class struggle.

And as Heinz and I drew closer,

I had no hesitation

in falling in love.

SHE COUGHS

She need to be in hospital,

but there is no bed.

Mutti...

SHE COUGHS

Gerald! Come on out.

I know you are in there!

He's not here! Where is he, then?

Hamburg. Hamburg?!

Well, when he's back, tell him

if I don't get what I want,

he knows what to expect.

Don't you, Gerald?

Some people seem to be utterly

lacking in consideration.

Tell me what it's about, Gerald.

A business transaction, that's

all, that went slightly awry.

What sort of business?

You know, Christopher,

you're looking as joyous

as the first day of spring.

Gerald!

I was offered a small fee

to help someone get his

hands on a police dossier.

Yes?

Actually, it was a positively

glacial sum that would have

paid off my debts at a stroke,

and do you know what?

The wretched man simply vanished.

Disparu without paying

me a single pfennig.

So who was that at the door?

A philistine, my dear.

Claiming interest on a little loan.

A loan for what? Oh, do keep up,

dear boy! For the money I needed to

bribe the police to get the dossier.

What on earth were you thinking of?

The trouble is everyone's so

greedy nowadays. And dishonest.

Simply can't trust a soul.

Gerald. Yes?

Your wig's slipped.

Oh!

DOOR CREAKS

No!

THUMP

'My dear Christopher, I've had

to leave Berlin at very short notice

'which made it impossible

for me to communicate with you.

'Our friend at the door finally

lost patience and matters

got a little out of hand.

'Try not to think too

hardly of me, dear boy.

'That would be more

than I could bear.

'As always,

your affectionate Gerald.'

They give her bed at last.

Ah, that's very good

news, Frau Neddermayer.

She make dress to look

nice in sanatorium.

Oh, I see. Well, it would be, um...

SHE COUGHS

To see his Nazi friends.

SHE BREATHES DEEPLY

SHE COUGHS

The last Kaiser

always mistrusted Berlin.

He saw it as a centre of,

how do you say, dissidence?

Yes.

What with the leftist working class

and the intellectual avant garde.

I'm wondering if the working

class is as leftist as one imagines.

It was not that long ago, Herr

Isherwood, that we came close

to a communist revolution,

but they lacked a strong leader.

This is where Adolf Hitler

has been so very clever

and exploited the situation.

Ever since the Treaty of Versaille

and then the Depression brought

the country to its knees

with banks failing and savings

disappearing, the poor and

unemployed see him as their saviour.

And the Nazis organise everywhere -

in bars and clubs

and schools like a virus.

I see. Ja. Like a virus.

But I am sure

that all this you know.

Or do you spend

too much time at play?

Berlin can be very distracting.

We must all stand by our

own kind, Christopher.

Whatever the cost.

I can't give you

anything but love

Baby

That's the only

thing I've plenty of

Baby

Dream a while

Scheme a while

We're sure to find

Happiness

And I guess

All those things

you've always pined for... 

I can't give you

anything but love

Baby! 

Oh, bravo! Did your mother

teach you to cook? Ja.

She's not very well,

she is at the sanitorium. I did say.

Yes, of course.

So tell me, what exactly is this?

Pig.

Oh, pork! How lovely!

Ja. It is, er...

Pork rib? Delicious!

I think he means lung.

Ja! Schweinelunge!

Oh. Golly.

And then before my very

eyes I saw him turn from

prince to frog and I thought, "Did

I really let that make love to me?"

This is my brother Gerhardt.

Gerhardt, it's a

pleasure to meet you.

Won't you join us? We're having

the most perfect evening.

I think your brother

is simply divine and he's

cooked us a marvellous meal.

You are no longer

welcome here, Herr Isherwood.

He doesn't mean it.

May I ask why?

Before our father went to the

Western Front, he said to me,

"Gerhardt, look out for your

mother and your brother."

I have always tried to honour

his memory, but with no work and

no money, it's been difficult.

I'm sure it is. Yes. But now

there is hope, Herr Isherwood,

and Herr Hitler is the reason.

Oh, for goodness sake!

He understands men like me.

He wants to make us proud again,

hold our heads up high again. The

Communists, they had their chance.

The Nazis are the people's

party now. This is your friends

at night school talking, Gerhardt.

Did he just call me a tart?

We do not want you

here, Herr Isherwood.

You and your kind.

Oh, how frightfully rude!

So take your pick, Heinz.

Make your father proud...

..or shame us all.

But Gerhardt...

Honestly, darling, how you can

leave poor Heinz with that monster?

I'm sure he can stand up for himself!

We'll probably find him hacked

into little pieces at

the bottom of a canal.

And you didn't help matters

addressing Gerhardt like you were

Queen Mary at an investiture.

And after all the trouble he

went to with that pig lung hash.

You bastards, you bastards!

For Christ's sake, Jean!

Brutes!

Filthy rotten brutes!

Shut up! For God's sake!

You're just as bad, every one

of you! Don't worry, darling...

It's over now. Can we get a taxi?

Can somebody please get a taxi!

Cracken house, ja?

You get used to it,

that's the danger.

The uniforms and the raids,

the street-fights

and the beatings...

We can't just stand by, can we?

No.

We can't, you know.

We really can't.

Gerhardt...

Such a pity,

isn't it, that we don't make love?

After all, there's

nothing else to do.

We could go to the movies.

I haven't got two

pfennigs to rub together.

Jean?

Jean, what is it?

Hollywood's off.

Oh, Jean, I'm so sorry.

"Dear Jean, I have to

go back to the States.

"Some emergency at HQ.

"It was fun, wasn't it?

"Bobby."

What a complete bastard.

Typical bloody American.

Flaky as hell!

You fancied him rotten!

That's beside the point. Come here.

And he was a most marvellous lover.

He was the best...

Oh, Jean. Poor darling...

He did leave me a little something.

So he bloody should!

But I shan't be keeping it.

Men say that they can be faithful

Simply I smile to myself

New love is always so novel

Faithfulness is but pretence

Now it is all but forgotten

But yesterday I still possessed

Love affords time that is blissful

Loyalty still makes no sense

I don't know to whom I belong

It would be such

a shame to end up on my own

If I make myself true to one

How another will surely

be sad and alone

Should such a beauty

belong to one person

No surely

the sun and the stars

They belong to us all

I don't know to whom I belong

I believe

I only

belong to myself. 

They come, they go,

and so it will always be.

Good morning, Herr Issyvoo.

Guten Morgan, Fraulein Thurau.

What a beautiful morning!

Even the sun seems to have

come out for Herr Hitler.

Oh, Herr Issyvoo?

The police have been round.

The police?

They were asking about my lodgers.

What did they want to know?

"Routine", they said.

RECORDING OF HITLER PLAYS

Hein, un Moment. Caspar!

I would remind you, sir,

that this is a Jewish store

and that there is now an

official anti-Jewish boycott.

Where have you been? I've been

looking everywhere for you.

You disappeared.

I didn't know what had happened.

Caspar!

I need to buy a pair of socks.

Shame!

Shame!

Beruf?

"Street-sweeper"? No. Maybe...

"domestic servant", or...

Yes, why not? "Domestic servant".

Heinz? I cannot come, Christoph.

But of course you can.

No, it is too dangerous...

for you, for me...

It's even more dangerous if you stay.

For Gerhardt. Gerhardt?

He's one of them, for God's sake!

He's my brother! We're brothers too,

Heinz, and more, much more besides!

And this is my country.

Not at the moment, it isn't.

It will be again one day, I've

no doubt, but in the meantime...

You do not miss home?

I have no home. This is home...

wherever I am.

We should be where we belong.

We are where we belong - together.

We must stand together.

We're responsible for each other,

as individuals. Don't you see?

You have to come with me.

I want you to.

Now you do, but in a week? A month?

I'll still want you Heinz.

Heinz. Of course I will.

YODELLING

I am sure I do not know,

Herr Issyvoo,

what makes you want to leave Berlin.

How can I best put this, Fraulein?

Adolf Hitler.

Ach, the Fuhrer!

One day it's Bruning, then von

Papen, the next von Schleicher,

then it's Hitler.

We must all make the best of it,

Herr Issyvoo. I am staying.

Most Germans are staying.

And besides, where else would we go?

Well, this is your homeland,

Fraulein. I understand that.

But Heinz and I, we want to get out.

We want to... Travel.

But why? To go here? To go there?

What is the point?

Soon no-one will be left.

Herr Hamilton has gone,

Fraulein Ross,

now you...

You get used to it.

You get used to anything.

CLOCK TICKS

Is your room...satisfactory?

Mummy, he's not retarded.

Where you sleep, is good, yes?

Yes. I sleep good.

Yes. Good. Thank you.

How long have you known Christopher?

Mummy... Shush!

I know Christopher

one year and one half.

Oh, that long, and he's hardly

mentioned you, if at all.

And how long are you staying

in our country? Two weeks.

I'm sure Heinz can answer for

himself, can't you, Heinz?

Two weeks.

You see?

What a shame it's not longer.

Two weeks is as long

as his permit allows.

Then maybe another time.

What is that?

Oh, now... Christopher!

That, Heinz, is Wyberslegh Hall,

part of the family estate.

It's in Cheshire

in the north of England.

I painted it, as a matter of fact.

You paint it?

Yes.

It's very good.

Thank you, Heinz.

That is the house where

I gave birth to Christopher.

Yes? And very difficult it was too.

I was in labour for 18 hours.

18 hours! Imagine that!

Mummy, please!

Oh, dear, that was rather

modern of me, wasn't it?

But it was worth it.

He was the most delightful baby.

I'm sure Heinz isn't

remotely interested.

He had the loveliest skin

and long slitty eyes...

just like a Jap.

You see, of course he's interested.

You live in the past, Mummy.

Perhaps I do, Christopher,

because it's always there

and never lets me down.

Do you have a mummy, Heinz?

She's dead. Oh.

Oh, I am sorry. Oh, dear.

Christopher's daddy's dead.

He was killed in the war.

He was my daddy too.

Yes, dear, but you hardly knew him.

He was killed by the Germans.

What are you thinking of, hmm!

I'm not blaming Heinz, darling.

I'm simply filling him in.

And for your information,

Heinz's daddy was also

killed on the Western Front.

Well, there you are, you see.

That's what wars do - kill people.

Toast?

He's a nice boy.

Well-mannered.

A street-cleaner, you say?

There's no reason a street-cleaner

can't be well-mannered.

No, dear. No reason at all.

How lovely to have a job like

ordinary people.

But who'd have you, my darling?

You seem to be inept at pretty much

everything. Don't speak to him

like that!

It's entirely your fault

he's like he is. Like what?

Richard, dear, we're talking.

It's terrible he has to go back,

and now Germany's withdrawn

from the League Of Nations.

Yes, that is rather troubling.

I must think of a way of

getting him out for good.

But why should that

be your responsibility?

Surely he knows people who can help.

He has absolutely no-one, Mummy,

except for a brother

who's disowned him,

and, besides, I want it to be my

responsibility.

So what will you do?

Get him another permit?

Or even another nationality.

Of course,

you could always adopt him.

Darling! I don't think so!

Are you sure he wouldn't

be happier in Germany?

It is his home, after all.

It's where he belongs.

And he isn't a Jew or anything.

You've no idea. It's Nazi Germany

we're talking about.

It's not just the Jews who

are being victimised.

I do read the papers, darling.

I'm fully aware that the

Nazis have done some bad things.

Although one hears that Herr

Hitler's done some good things too.

Dear God!

If it weren't for that wretched boy

Auden, dragging you off there...

I assure you, he

didn't need to drag me.

But you must do as you wish,

Christopher, as you always do...

so long as you realise

what you might be taking on.

Right. We're going to have to

mail money to him in Berlin... "We"?

..So he can support himself until he

comes back here, and if you write

a letter inviting him to stay...

Christopher! ..Then

I'm sure they'll give him a much

longer permit, maybe even for keeps.

You can't do that!

You'll find that I can.

But you haven't proved your case!

Mr Isherwood,

your mother invites a foreign

servant to her home without

the requisite permit,

you send the boy money telling

him to claim it was a bequest,

which could be construed as

an attempt to deceive His Majesty's

Immigration Service,

but then

we have the letter you wrote.

May I?

"I am counting the days

until your arrival.

"I've been so lonely without you."

A bit curious, don't you think,

the way it's written? A bit...

what's the word? Queer?

Thank you, Mr Auden.

What a boon to have a poet on hand!

You can't send him back!

Christopher... No!

God knows what they might do!

Not my responsibility.

So an alien has no rights

whatsoever in this democracy

that men have laid down

their lives for.

I hope, should the moment come,

that you too will be ready

to make the sacrifice.

Make no mistake, I shall appeal!

You can write to the Home Secretary

for all the good it will do.

Come on.

As soon as I saw that rat,

I knew we were done for.

They're all the bloody same!

Oh no, he's one of us.

It stands out a mile.

I'm sorry.

You seem out of sorts.

Do I?

It's Heinz, isn't it?

Goodbyes are always sad.

As sad as dying.

I'll be seeing him soon enough.

That's right. Yeah.

No need to be sad.

I suppose being a writer,

you want to tidy everything up

and make it make sense.

But things never do

quite make sense, do they?

Not really.

No.

This Sally Bowles character...

is she based on anyone?

Yes, in a manner of speaking.

And what about Mr Norris?

Yes, I suppose he is too. I thought

we might first meet him on a train.

Oh, yes. Trains are always good.

You can't go wrong with a train.

Where were we?

Full stop, close quotation marks.

Good. It must be very polarising,

this Nazi business.

Hard to sit on the fence,

I'd imagine. Yes, it is.

Berlin's fairly seething, what with

all the poverty and wounded pride.

I'd say communism was

the best hope for peace.

Then why not stay here

and join the Party?

I can't do that!

I have Heinz to consider.

Yes, Heinz. Of course.

So where will you go?

Amsterdam, probably.

For the time being.

That's all one can say, isn't it?

"For the time being."

It always breaks my heart

a little to see you leave.

You should be used to it by now.

Oh, no, I'll never get used to it...

..And how awful if I did.

I'll be back.

I always am.

'And so once again I cast off

from England and threw

in my lot with Heinz.

'Two lost souls wandering

around Europe on the brink...

'I have to admit I felt a little

guilty flitting from country to

country to save a single man,

'whilst others were

preparing to save the world.

'But then our luck ran out and Heinz

was arrested by the Gestapo,

'and that was that.'

Daily Worker, ladies?

No appeasement! Fight the fascists!

Excuse me, Miss...

I'm exercising my democratic right!

Only you would choose to sell

The Daily Worker in Knightsbridge.

I have no say in the matter.

I go where the Party tells me.

You're looking impossibly young.

Are you ever going to age?

I do hope not. My God! The varnish!

I somehow felt that red

was more appropriate.

I must confess

I carry it with me everywhere.

Isn't it funny, darling, that

you're the one that became famous?

And you know I must say

I'm rather enjoying it,

and meanwhile poor Heinz...

Well...I dread to think

what he's being subjected to.

A year labouring for the state

followed by two years in the army.

It's frightfully harsh.

It could be worse -

he might have got carted

off to a concentration camp.

You did all you could.

I wonder if I did?

I wonder if I did, really?

And what's worse,

I even feel relieved.

Hmm.

Do you ever miss Berlin? Oh, no.

I never miss anything.

Sometimes I wonder if I

shouldn't have had that kid.

I think I'd just about have

cut the mustard as a mother.

I'd tuck him in,

and I'd sing to him.

And then I'd go out and fuck

filthy old men to pay for the brat!

Then why not marry and have another?

Because I've lost my faith in men.

Well, that's a shame.

I have simply no use

for them any more.

Not even you, darling.

Oh, well,

back to the revolution.

Might we see each other again?

Goodbye, Chris.

Goodbye.

'It seems everyone's caught

communism like flu.'

I think it's fair to say that the

closest we've come to solidarity

with the workers is

sleeping with them.

Well, that's a cause of sorts.

The only cause you really care

about, Christopher, is yourself.

Isn't that rather unkind?

Hmm. But you've turned

it into an art form -

rather successfully, as it happens.

I used to be a little

in love with you.

You knew that, didn't you?

Yes, I thought you did.

You're lucky - you're not

burdened by the concept of sin.

And it is a sin, Christopher...

although I fully intend

to carry on sinning.

Please, don't start on about God!

You're going to have

such a conversion one

of these days, my dear.

I do loathe the sea.

It's so wet and sloppy.

I don't belong here.

I'm not sure I belong anywhere.

I rather like being a foreigner.

I wonder where we might end up?

'Wystan was right.

'I've never known about

anybody except me. You see,

'I was never able to commit - I only

ever sort of added to the chorus.

'And now, of course, politics are

more and more about the individual.

'The gay liberation movement seems to

have taken me to its heart.

'It's very nice of them, really.

'A cause at last!

'But then I think it always was

my cause. And somehow, you know...

'it makes sense of

what I was trying to do for Heinz.

'All those years ago...'

Christoph?

You write again about Berlin?

Yes, for a British newspaper.

A lot has changed, ja?

What's left of it.

When the city was cut in pieces,

we end up in the Russian sector.

Rotten luck, eh?

We all hate the Russians, Christoph.

We would much rather be here

in the West Zone.

Maybe one day.

My friend Christoph,

the famous writer.

I suppose you could say that.

Tell me,

there are skyscrapers in America?

Oh, yes.

And you see Hollywood?

I live near there, actually.

And the Grand Canyon? You see that?

Yes. It's...

very big.

And cowboys?

No, I haven't seen too many of them.

I feel guilty, Heinz.

All that I made you suffer. I should

never have taken you out of Germany.

But Christoph, you change my life.

What we had, what we did,

I would not miss for the world.

Look, Christoph...

My wife, Hilde.

Well, she looks...

very nice!

She's a good girl.

And she doesn't ask questions.

That's all right then.

And this is my son...

..Christoph.

Christoph?

Ja.

Well.

You know, Christoph,

you are not getting younger.

That's the way it tends to go.

You live alone, yes?

At the moment.

That is not good, to live alone.

You need a family around you,

to keep you company, to

look after you when you are sick.

Heinz, I'm not decrepit!

But listen, Christoph,

we could be your family. What?

Hilde, Christoph and I.

Out there in...California.

Ah, well...

Erm, I'm not so sure about that.

You see, the life I lead...

My, my plans are so uncertain.

I'd have to think it over.

Look, we'll see. See how it goes.

And I'll write you,

we'll keep in touch.

You do understand, don't you, Heinz?

You do...don't you?

Yes. I...I understand.

Fraulein!

Ho-ho-ho-ho!

Oh!

When the city was divided, we got

the Americans. Oh, I am so happy!

We are all so happy!

I thank God the Russians

didn't get us. Communism!

Oh, Herr Issyvoo,

you look like a child!

It's lovely to see you, Fraulein.

Herr Issyvoo, Herr Issyvoo!

Ach, the last year of the war,

Herr Issyvoo! Yes. It was terrible.

We were in the cellar nearly

all the time, holding each other.

We prayed so much,

we got quite religious!

Ah! Is the yodeller still there?

No, thank God! The Nazis shot her.

It's the one good thing they did!

Another survivor, eh, Fraulein?

Another survivor.

It was damaged a little,

but I mended it.

For you.

No, I couldn't.

Take it, please,

and when you look at it,

you will think of Berlin,

and Fraulein Thurau,

and smile.

Thank you.

# Dolor y gloria

I wish I were a man,

to swim naked in the river.

How brave.

The things you say, Rosita.

Yeah, and have the water running

all over your thingy, how nice!

Yeah, that's right.

Before you jump in the water,

take the boy off me.

He's breaking my back.

- I'm sorry.

- Come, Salvador, come here.

Let's see.

Look, here's a stick for you to play.

- Okay.

- All right.

- Mari, help me with the sheets.

- Coming.

The little soapy fish.

Look! There they are.

The little soapy fish.

Sing a song for us, Rosita.

How beautiful.

- By your side

- Look how beautiful they are.

By your side

Always by your little side

Always by your little side

Until from pain I die

I couldn't look into your eyes

I couldn't knock at your door

Salvita, don't move from there, okay?

I couldn't step at night

On the cobblestones of your alley

By your side

Always by your little side

Always by your little side

Until of love I die

Look, they say and say

Look at that afternoon

Look how it went and came

From his house to the poplar grove

And that way, looking and looking

Come on, girl.

That's how my blindness

Started

Salva.

It's Zulema.

What a surprise!

- Darling.

- I'm so happy to see you.

Can you have a coffee with me,

or are you in a hurry?

What will you do if

you don't write or film?

- Live, I guess.

- I can't live without acting.

It's getting more difficult,

but I take everything they offer me.

Do you see Alberto?

- I think he was in Argentina.

- No, no, in Mexico.

He was working on some soap operas,

but he's back now.

I bumped into him at a Latin film festival

on the Riviera Maya.

He was lovely. It was some time ago,

but it was a very, very nice meeting.

Have you seen him?

No, no. I haven't seen him

since the premiere of Flavor.

But that was... 30 years ago.

Thirty-two.

You know, I saw the movie again last week.

- You hadn't watched it again?

- No, not since the premiere.

And it's wrong to say this,

but it moved me.

I've always loved it.

No, the cinematheque restored the negative,

and they're going to hold some screenings.

They asked me to present it, and I thought

it would be good to do it with Alberto.

I'm glad you're not holding a grudge.

The bastard never did

the character I wrote.

I wanted to kill him.

But... I don't really hold grudges.

Having seen the movie again,

his acting is better now than 30 years ago.

It's your eyes that changed, honey.

It's the same movie.

Do you know how to find him?

He lives in El Escorial.

Yeah, at somebody's house.

He works once in a while,

but he looks good, without giving up...

Well, you know what I mean.

I'm surprised it's you who's not working.

I always thought you'd be

the one to never retire.

Same here.

- Do you still have the same number?

- Yeah.

I'll send you his contact info,

and I'll send mine too,

in case you ever get bored

and write something only I can do.

Here we are.

I leave you with Father José María.

Good morning, boys.

The first thing we're going to do is choose

the members of the chorus.

Has anybody sung in a chorus before?

Raise your hand.

Okay, we're going to have a test.

You, come here. Yes, you.

- What's your name?

- Rodolfo.

Rodolfo, let's check out your vocalization.

Repeat after me.

You, next to him.

What's your name?

- Salvador.

- Beautiful name. Do you like to sing?

- I don't know.

- But you like music, right?

Yes, I like The Beatles and movies.

Well, here we will broaden and direct

your tastes towards less pagan subjects.

Let's do a vocalization test.

Let's warm up those voices, boys.

That's how I became the chorus soloist.

The priests decided that I shouldn't go

to geography and history classes,

or science and art history.

The first three years of high school,

I rehearsed during the hours

of those classes

and I always passed.

They made me into a complete ignoramus

who passed every class

without actually taking the exams.

GEOGRAPHY

Eventually, I became a film director.

And I started to learn Spanish geography

by traveling to promote

the films I directed.

I traveled because I was successful.

My knowledge of geography matched

the expansion of my career.

ANATOMY

I started to know my body

through pain and illness.

I lived my first 30 years

pretty much in the dark,

but soon I discovered that my head

and what was inside it,

besides being a source

of pleasure and knowledge,

held infinite possibilities for pain.

Soon I found insomnia,

chronic pharyngitis, otitis, acid reflux,

ulcers, and intrinsic asthma.

Nerves in general

and the sciatic nerve in particular.

And all kinds of muscular pain:

Lumbar, dorsal, tendinitis,

both knees and shoulders.

This is tinnitus.

I have it too.

This is wheezing.

I also suffer from this.

Besides tinnitus and wheezing,

headaches are my specialty.

Migraines, tension or cluster headaches,

and back pain.

From my lumbar spinal-fusion surgery,

which immobilized more

than half of my back,

I found that my life would revolve around

the spinal column.

I became aware of each one of the vertebrae

and the amount of muscles and ligaments

that make up the mythology of our body.

And just like the Greek gods,

the only way we can relate

is through sacrifice.

But not all is as physical

and illustratable.

I also suffer from abstract sorrows.

Aches of the soul, like panic and anxiety,

that add angst and horror to my life.

And of course,

I have toggled with depression for years.

On the nights where several aches coincide,

those nights I believe in God.

And I pray.

On the days that I only have

one kind of pain,

I'm an atheist.

It's here, it's here.

All right.

- Keep the change.

- Thank you, sir.

- Bye, thank you.

- Good day.

Who is it?

Alberto, it's Salvador.

Salvador who?

Salvador Mallo.

What are you doing here?

I need to talk to you.

- About what?

- Flavor.

Can I come in?

Want something to drink?

Whatever you're having.

I was making some tea.

Okay, then.

Oh, look.

FLAVOR

I love the fact that you have Flavor here.

Why have you come?

It took me 32 years

to reconcile myself with this film.

Thirty-two years.

Beautiful.

What are those trees, firs?

Pine.

Are you gonna fucking tell me

why you came to see me after 32 years?

The cinematheque restored Flavor.

They decided it's a classic,

and they included it

in a series of movies shot in Madrid.

They called to ask

if we could present it together.

And they don't know we haven't talked

to each other since the shoot?

If they know, they didn't say anything.

Alberto,

gossip gets old, like people.

- Listen, do you mind if we sit down?

- No, no, sit down.

Thank you very much.

But why do you want

to present it together now?

Because you didn't present it

at the premiere.

Because you didn't let me, fag.

That's why I think it's fair that both

of us present it at the cinematheque.

Who gave you my address?

Zulema.

I bumped into her and we talked about you.

Listen, I'm gonna chase the dragon.

If it repulses you, you can go.

And we'll call each other

for the cinematheque thing.

Can I have some?

I don't recognize you, Salvador.

- What, it's your first time?

- Yeah.

And why do you want to try heroin now?

I'm curious.

You must be doing research for something.

The drop, the drop, the drop.

Salvador.

Salva.

Salva!

Come here and help me.

Mom, I found a novel.

Very good, put it there.

Grab this.

How the hell could I know

it was a holiday here?

It's not a holiday in our town.

I didn't know either.

What a night we're going to have, son.

How embarrassing.

Open the chocolate, Salvador.

Okay, Mom.

Mom, there are two trading cards.

Leave them, son. Come on, let's eat.

Liz Taylor and Robert Taylor.

Do you think they're brother and sister?

Well, I guess.

Eat.

Oh, what a shame, son.

We're here like gypsies.

I like the station.

You're so imaginative.

I don't know who you got that from.

Cover yourself, don't get sick.

Oh, my God, what's that tomato?

I hadn't seen that.

Give it to me. I'll stitch it.

Look, with the egg.

Move over there, go to sleep.

Did you know that your dad in the army...

learned how to sew

and mend and iron shirts?

He was very good at it.

Do you think I'll join the army?

I guess you'll have to, son.

I don't want to join the army.

And I don't want you to go. That's useless.

- Mom.

- Yes?

Do you think

Liz Taylor mends Robert Taylor's socks?

I don't know.

In the pictures,

she doesn't look like she likes sewing.

Are you okay?

Don't forget to breathe, eh?

No.

My God, what a long night.

I thought we were never gonna make it.

I told you to wait a few days

until I was settled in.

- Your mother was sick of us.

- Don't say that.

Oh, no? Do you know what she said

three days ago?

"This month's bread bill has skyrocketed."

Can you believe it?

Don't mind her, woman. You know how she is.

I won't be a burden on anyone.

That same day I packed our bags,

and here we are.

Salva! Salva, come here.

- Or do you prefer to be alone?

- Jacinta, please, don't say that.

I'm just saying,

you could've waited a few days.

- Is it much further?

- No.

We're here.

Our house is here?

We're on top of it.

What do you mean, on top?

On top.

- A cave?

- It's the best I could do.

- For christ sake, Venancio, a cave?

- Salva, come on, let's go.

But how are we going to live in a cave?!

There are more than 300 families living

in caves. It's typical of this village.

There's no shame in that.

Is this our house, Dad?

This is it, son. This is it.

A cave!

Oh, my God.

Leaving town and coming here was your idea.

What would they say if they saw us now?

I haven't had time to whitewash,

that's why I wanted you to wait a little.

Everything's a mess.

It still needs some fixing up.

Mom, look, the sky!

Look.

I cleaned up the best I could.

Are you happy we came?

Jacinta, I wanted something else for you.

You think I'm happy bringing you to a cave?

There wasn't anything else.

It's okay.

I'll fix it so it looks like a house.

Come on.

But your mother, really...

Complaining about the bread

in front of the kid.

Look, he loves it.

I don't want you to be so serious.

You look ugly.

Dad, can I sweep up?

No, I need a taxi to pick me up at...

One second.

- What's the address?

- 89 Ponton Street.

89 Ponton Street.

In San Lorenzo de El Escorial, yeah.

The destination is

108 Paseo del Pintor Rosales.

Yeah, Madrid. That's right.

Good, very good.

Fifteen minutes, fine, thanks.

- The cinematheque thing is clear, right?

- Yeah.

On the 18th. In three weeks.

- I'm already thinking about the outfit.

- Good.

But we'll talk before that, won't we?

- Okay.

- What are you doing?

Aren't we going to kiss

like old lady friends?

We even chased the dragon together.

Okay, okay.

Hello.

Mrs. Mercedes called

and said to call her when you can

- Hello.

- It's... It's me.

Salvador,

is it true about the cinematheque?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Keep me updated. Don't ignore me so much.

I was gonna tell you.

I love that they're showing Flavor

and that you're going out.

But are you sure you want a Q&A?

- It'll be packed.

- No, I don't want a Q&A.

But I'm curious to see if the film

has survived these past 30 years.

Don't doubt it.

But if you decide not to go,

tell me and I'll fix it, okay?

It's better to cancel now

than at the last minute.

All right, bye.

I'm leaving, do you need anything?

- No, thanks, Maya, see you tomorrow.

- See you tomorrow.

"I was the loneliest man

death has ever seen.

I entered the room where Johannes was.

He had turned around and curled up,

so there was no room for me.

When I tried to make some space,

he woke up and we made love.

But loneliness was with me

and I couldn't expel it from my heart.

We were as close as two people can be,

but each one in his own world."

Hi. Weren't you going to open the door?

I wasn't expecting anybody

and I have a headache.

- I can leave if you want me to.

- No, come in now that you're here.

Do you live like this?

- In the dark?

- When I have a headache, yes.

Poor guy. What a great house you have, man.

Want something to drink?

Any kind of alcohol.

Wonderful.

What...? What should I do? What...?

Breathe through your nose.

Through your nose.

Through your nose.

Wait, wait. Water.

Calm down. Here.

Wait. Breathe.

Drink.

Careful. Drink. Slowly, slowly, slowly.

Fuck! I choke on everything.

Fuck, it was scary.

I thought you were choking to death.

I'm okay. It happens every once in a while.

And it's horrible.

THE ADDICTION

"My idea of the movie theater was always

linked to the breeze of summer nights.

We only watched movies in the summer."

Movies were screened on

a huge whitewashed wall.

I remember especially

the movies with water.

Waterfalls, beaches,

the bottom of the ocean, rivers or springs.

Hearing the sound of the water

made us kids want to pee really bad.

And we would do it right there,

on both sides of the screen.

My childhood movie theater

always smells like pee.

And jasmine. And a summer breeze.

What are you doing there?

I'm reading you.

I just read "The Addiction."

Well, you shouldn't.

I had to do something. You were groggy.

May I?

Yeah, yeah.

Oh, delicious!

Hey, I loved the short story, man.

It's not a short story.

Okay, whatever it is.

It could be brought to the stage

just like it is.

- Thanks, but it's not a dramatic text.

- Doesn't matter.

I could interpret it.

I know very well what it's about.

You?

You're on the opposite side of that text.

You forget, I'm an actor.

And I'm very good at suffering.

Salvador, I need to act again.

I climbed down my pedestal

a long time ago.

Look, I'm in contact

with the Mirador Theater.

I know it's a very small theater,

very "off,"

to stage Cocteau's

Le Bel Indifférent.

With men, to give it a twist.

But to tell you the truth,

I prefer your text by far.

Give me a copy

- and I'll give it to the director.

- Stop, stop.

I don't get it. Why'd you write it?

I wrote it to forget about it,

but I don't want to talk about that.

Would you mind giving me the rest of it?

Here.

I'm not a drug dealer, man. Here.

It's yours.

But manage it with discretion.

Because these late discoveries

are the worst. And you look like a killer.

Hey, think about what I told you

about the Mirador Theater.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- Is your headache gone?

- Completely.

- See?

- That's right.

Think he's on his way?

I don't know. You handled this yourself.

I don't get it.

I showed him the restoration, he loved it.

- The bathroom?

- Yeah, on the left.

Why don't you call him?

- Is there gonna be a Q&A?

- Yes, yes, yes. The director's on his way.

All right.

The cinematheque.

Yeah, right, right.

I can't believe it, man.

You make such a big deal

and then you don't show up.

The trouble I went through

to borrow this jacket...

You go.

How can I go by myself?

- I don't want them to see me like this.

- How?

We're not going to a beauty pageant,

it's a fucking Q&A.

I don't want them to see me drugged

and hesitant.

Once you go on-stage, you get invigorated.

You've been great.

Hey, that was before.

And I didn't smoke heroin.

- Salvador, where are you?

- At home.

Still?

The movie ended, the audience is waiting.

Oh, yeah?

I'm with Salvador Mallo.

We both were thinking about coming.

Alberto Crespo is with me.

And the protagonist, Alberto Crespo.

Would you mind applauding again so

they can hear it? Maybe they'll come, then.

- Is everybody listening?

- Yes, Salvador.

Well, I would like to apologize

to the audience.

I didn't feel good at the last minute.

I'm with Alberto Crespo.

He stayed here with me.

Salvador, excuse me.

Someone is raising his hand,

I think he wants to ask you something.

It's a small question for the director.

Mr. Mallo, what do you think about Alberto

Crespo's interpretation in the film?

Some say that you didn't like it

and you two grew apart because of it.

Salvador, did you hear the question?

Yeah, yeah, I heard it.

I read that you had an argument

after Flavor.

That you hadn't seen each other.

Look... Time is mysterious.

I saw the film again a month ago,

and I think Alberto's interpretation

has improved a lot since the premiere.

What was it that you didn't like then?

His tediousness.

His lethal rhythm.

I conceived a dynamic character,

a funny, sarcastic cocaine addict.

Alberto didn't have the lightness

I was asking for.

Not because he was incapable,

but because he used the opposite drug

of his character, heroin.

And, well, the rhythm of his interpretation

was more serious,

and the humor of the text disappeared.

But I have to be fair. Now I believe

that seriousness suits the character.

It gives him... weight.

How dare you.

I wasn't planning on saying it,

but it's done.

Be careful with me, eh?

I won't allow you to humiliate me again.

- Who the fuck do you think you are?

- I just told the truth.

Before filming, you promised me

you wouldn't use heroin.

I gave you the role on that condition

and you lied!

You did whatever the hell you wanted

and I had to tell you someday!

You're fucking crazy.

- I gave him all the messages.

- Right.

He's been avoiding me.

- Are you sure he's okay?

- He eats very little and chokes a lot.

Puree everything you make.

- Does he go out for walks?

- I don't see him.

But he walks around the house,

in the hallway.

Right.

I saw some moccasins at the entrance,

and he never liked moccasins.

He wears them. Even though he has tons

of nice tennis shoes.

Maya, tell him you don't mind

tying his shoes or his tennis shoes.

It must be hard for him

to tie his own shoelaces. Poor thing.

Sure, I tell him that, Mrs. Mercedes.

But he doesn't want me to.

I think he's embarrassed,

and I feel sorry for him.

I don't know what to do.

Well, smile and take care of him.

And if you see something strange, call me.

Mrs. Mercedes, everything's strange here.

Right.

May I help you?

I don't know.

What are you looking for?

Two stamp bags.

Ten euros.

- Ten euros?

- Yeah.

But don't bring me some shitty thing.

If it's good, I'll come back.

Give me the money.

- No, no, no. When you bring the merchandise.

- You pay cash now.

Wait for me here.

Come on! I'm gonna kill you. Come on!

- Come on!

- Want to fight?

Faggot, come on!

- Faggot!

- Come on, I'm gonna kill you, come on!

Come here. Come here.

Come here! Come on!

Look at the kid.

So little and look at him reading.

Listen, do you know how to write too?

Yes.

How much would you charge us

for writing a letter to my aunt in Bilbao?

I don't know.

What's going on?

We wanted your son

to write a letter for us.

Because my boyfriend is illiterate.

When am I gonna learn,

if I'm working all day long?

If you didn't waste your time drawing...

- Are you a bricklayer?

- And a painter.

Right. It's a shame that you're illiterate,

being so handsome.

My Salvador can teach

you to read and write.

Right?

In the evenings,

when you're done with work.

At the best time for you.

- Could you teach me math too?

- Yes.

Of course.

The four rules, so nobody cheats you.

It's backwards to be illiterate

in this world we live.

I'll bring pen and paper

to write the letter, okay?

- How much would you charge us?

- Nothing, woman. Nothing.

Since you're a bricklayer,

you could help me finish the kitchen

and paint the walls a little bit, eh?

- Whenever you can.

- It can only be Sunday.

Sundays, all right.

In exchange, my Salvador will teach you

to read and write, the four rules,

and today's letter for free.

Thank you.

A, B, C,

CH, D...

Eduardo, when are you putting the sink in?

I have to wash everything in these buckets.

I wanted to finish

whitewashing the walls first.

No, the sink is more urgent.

I'm used to the walls like this.

It's just that Salvador gives me

a lot of homework, and I don't have time.

Salvador?

If he wants to learn to read and write,

- he needs to memorize the alphabet.

- Okay.

Come on, Eduardo. Start again.

A, B, C,

CH, F, J...

No, Eduardo.

It's F, G, H, I, J, K.

- You said it right before.

- There are too many letters.

Stop complaining. It is what it is.

No, Eduardo. You don't hold it like that,

give me the pencil.

Look. You hold it like this, okay?

Now you do it.

- Like this?

- Yes, yes.

No, Eduardo.

You don't have to hold it so tight.

Relax your hand. I'll guide it.

- U...

- U...

I'm a little nervous.

It's okay. It's much better.

- Do you like to draw?

- A lot.

Then you'll learn to write very quickly.

Because writing is like drawing

but with letters.

Now you do it by yourself.

That's it.

Read the sentence.

"One...

holy...

catholic...

apostolic."

"One, holy, catholic, apostolic."

Who's that?

Spain. Who else?

Write it all continuously.

Very good, Eduardo.

You're stopping much less than before.

There are tons of invitations.

- It wouldn't hurt you to go out somewhere.

- "Cecil Beaton."

- I'll go with you wherever you want.

- I wish.

The dance season started.

Dimitris Papaioannou and Jan Fabre

are coming to the Canal Theaters.

Public theater seats are

the most uncomfortable for me.

And I don't want to leave in the middle.

Have you seen Dr. Galindo?

No. I'm fed up with doctors.

How do you get the oxycodone?

A friend gets it for me.

His mother's a pharmacist.

This book came for you.

"How to End Counterculture."

Whatever.

The Guggenheim is asking us for two

Pérez Villalta paintings, for an anthology.

No, no. Tell them no.

Those paintings are my only company.

I live with those paintings, Mercedes.

Excuse me.

Hi.

Talk to me.

Yes.

Yeah, yeah, I'm listening.

I have to go.

I can't... I can't keep talking.

It's none of your business where I am.

Is there something wrong?

No.

Luis and I are splitting up.

I didn't know you had problems.

I didn't want to bother you.

This is an old issue and...

And now that I have to be at home so much,

I couldn't keep lying to myself.

I'm sorry.

So, if you don't mind,

I would like to keep

taking care of your mail.

People like getting an answer.

But it's always a no.

Well, you should do something.

You have too much free time

to think about your illnesses.

Give your brain

something to entertain itself.

I'd like to do some things too, Mercedes.

You could write.

You have a ton of documents full of ideas

to develop. I'll make you a list.

No,

I don't want to write if I can't film it.

You know better than anybody

that I can't face a shoot in this state.

Without filming, my life has no purpose.

But that's just how things are.

Call me, okay?

- Call me for whatever you need.

- Yeah.

Jacinta,

the cave looks beautiful.

Oh, and that light, my God, it's wonderful.

It rains sometimes.

You can't be so selfish, Jacinta.

Rain is necessary.

Think of the countryside, of farmers.

- Well, it's true.

- Of course.

Okay, Salvador. Let's see...

Since your mother told me that, at

9 years old, you were a teacher, I thought:

"This boy must be for God."

He's always been ahead of boys his age.

- Do you like to teach, Salvador?

- Yes.

- And would you like to study?

- Yes, very much.

Why?

To know more

and be able to teach more things.

Very good.

Very good. That's what I call a calling.

I'll talk to Father José María,

and he'll take care of everything.

Thank you very much.

Salvador, next year,

you're going to high school at a seminary.

We'll see how you behave.

Not everybody gets a scholarship.

- So the scholarship is a sure thing?

- Yes, woman.

Don't worry.

And we'll see how you make me look.

Think, you're one of the chosen ones.

Well, I'm leaving.

I still have one visit to make.

- Don't you want some more juice?

- No, thanks. It was really good.

Bye, Salvador.

The whitewashed walls

look very nice, Jacinta.

- Yeah? It's better.

- It's beautiful.

To tell you the truth,

I'm quite jealous of you.

Me?

Sure, you live in catacombs

like ancient Christians.

Well, yeah, that's right.

Should I come sew on Sunday?

Yes, I'll see you on Sunday at home.

- Thanks a lot.

- You're welcome.

- Mom.

- What, honey?

Is a seminary the place to become a priest?

Yes.

Do you want me to make you

the Spanish tortilla you like?

Handsome!

I don't want to be a priest!

You don't have to be.

Then why do you want

me to go to a seminary?

Because the poor have no other way

of studying. That's why.

What do you want me to do?

Salvador.

Salvador!

Salvador!

That boy...

Salvador! Come down from there!

- Come down.

- I don't want to go to the seminary.

You can leave when you finish high school.

We'll figure out a way

for you to have a career.

So you don't have to live like your father.

I don't want to go to school.

I want to stay here.

And what will you do here, son?

What will you do here?

Break your back working in the fields?

Or in construction? Is that what you want?

I don't want to be a priest.

"Life disgusts me as a useless medicine.

It is then when I clearly feel

how easy it would be to get away

from this tediousness

if I had the simple strength

to want to really push it away."

Who is it?

- It's me.

- Go away.

- If you don't leave, I'll call the police.

- Alberto, I'm here to negotiate.

I'll give you the rights

to interpret "The Addiction."

I don't believe you.

- Go away. I'm busy.

- I mean it.

I have here a copy of the text.

Please, open the door.

If this is a trap, you'll leave more

of a hunchback than you already are.

What, are you on a hunger strike?

Are you still thinking of doing everything

at the Mirador Theater?

Yes.

But I have a lot of doubts.

The text is very nice, but it's obsolete.

If you really give me "The Addiction,"

I'll get completely into it.

I would have to tell the people

at the Mirador, of course.

Here it is.

Why the change?

I looked at the text,

like you said, and...

- I'll tell you more if you give me some tea.

- Sure.

Anything else?

Yes, I don't want to sign it.

And don't say it's mine.

- I don't want to appear anywhere.

- All right. Will you direct me?

No, no.

- Man, that would help.

- No, no.

Give it to the theater, and let them

read it and see if they're interested.

But don't give my name.

- So who's the author?

- You are.

Or we make up a pseudonym.

No, no, no. I'll sign it. I'll sign it.

But I don't get you.

It's a confessional text.

- I don't want anybody to identify me.

- Right.

Regarding the staging,

I suggest an empty stage,

a screen, a chair.

If you don't know what to do

with your arms and hands.

I know well what to do

with my arms and hands.

After the corrections,

I admit, it is a bit less melodramatic.

Don't worry. I can also control melodrama.

My years in Mexico will be of use.

That's why I'm telling you,

you must avoid sentimentalism.

Control your emotions, don't cry.

You actors use any excuse to cry.

The better actor is not the one that cries,

but the one that fights the tears.

Let me give you a kiss, you faggot.

Listen, if you don't mind,

I'll start working right away.

If you want to stay, this is your house.

By the way, I have a ton of magazines

from the '80s. You appear in some of them.

Dressed as a woman.

- You forget about that too soon.

- Okay, but before, give me something.

And give me your dealer's address. Tell him

I'll come myself to pick up the merchandise.

That's not necessary. Now they bring it

to your house, like a pizza.

Lighter.

Here.

- No. Not yet.

- Why?

I'm lowering my dose just enough

to be able to work.

Can you do it?

How do you think I'm here?

Coming and going.

It's slavery.

But this play is vital for me.

And I must do it as clean as I can.

I don't want to lose one bit...

of the feeling you put into these pages.

Will you come see me?

I don't know. I don't think so.

This time I'm not doing Shakespeare.

Or Chekhov, or Lorca.

I'm doing you.

I'll feel terrible if you do it wrong.

And if you do it right,

I'll feel much worse.

"My childhood movie theater...

always smells like pee."

And jasmine.

And a summer breeze.

I met Marcelo in a bathroom full of people.

It wasn't the first time I saw him.

But it was that night...

after casually rubbing

against each other...

when I found out I liked that boy.

We spent the whole weekend in bed.

And without realizing it,

a year had gone by.

And now we couldn't

live without each other.

It was 1981...

and Madrid was ours.

One day, I found Marcelo paler than usual.

Lately, he had lost weight

and had dark circles under his eyes.

I asked him if he didn't feel well,

and he confessed he had started

to fool around with heroin.

I was surprised

because I had never tried it.

I drank and sniffed cocaine

like everybody else.

But heroin, never.

I had a feeling that wasn't good,

and I didn't like it.

I was in a whirlwind, I wrote a column on

nightlife, I participated in music shows,

I sang in a parodic punk band,

I was preparing my first film, I filmed it,

it was released, it was successful.

I wrote the second one, I filmed it.

I did a thousand things, I didn't sleep...

while Marcelo languished

on the couch at home.

Or locked in the bathroom.

Or out of the house

at some place I didn't know about.

I would spend the night coming and going

from the window to the bed.

Waiting to hear the sound of the door.

MIRADOR THEATER - ACTING SCHOOL

ADDICTION

Madrid had become a difficult arena,

like bullfighters say.

So we traveled a lot.

Anything to get out of Madrid.

The worst were the first few days.

While Marcelo recovered from the cravings,

I took care of him...

and wrote.

I don't know how,

but I wrote.

Marcelo was very young,

the cravings were short, three, four days.

Afterwards, we would go out

and play like little kids.

I remember Ivory Coast.

Tens of strong young guys washing

their clothes in the river.

On car tires.

The Malecón in Havana.

During the day or night.

Old Havana, sweetly pulsing to the rhythm

of nonstop percussion.

I remember Mexico City.

Marcelo and I drunk,

listening to Chavela Vargas sing

"La Noche de mi Amor."

I want

The happiness of a boat returning

A thousand bells of glory ringing...

The only reason for those trips was

to escape Madrid.

Escaping from the heroin...

became my best learning experience.

In those trips, I found the inspiration

to write the stories

that I would tell years later

and the colors that would illuminate them.

But we couldn't spend our lives traveling.

Sooner or later,

we had to come back to Madrid.

And Madrid was a minefield,

a dead-end street.

I was desperate, I didn't know what to do.

Except repeating myself.

The two of us repeated ourselves

for three long years.

I believed the strength of my love

would defeat his addiction.

But that didn't happen.

Love is not enough.

Love may move mountains...

but it's not enough

to save the person you love.

Under the whitewashed wall

where my childhood movies were screened,

I would pray so nothing bad happened

to the protagonists.

But I didn't manage to do it.

Not with Natalie Wood or Marilyn.

Then I tried to save Marcelo and myself.

If Marcelo saved himself,

it was far away from me.

And me, I stayed in Madrid.

And film saved me.

CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF

Come in.

Hello.

Good evening.

Good evening.

Come in.

- Do we know each other?

- Yes.

I don't remember you.

A long time ago, when you were preparing

Flavor with Salvador Mallo...

- I'm sorry, I don't remember.

- We saw each other two or three times.

I'm Federico,

the Marcelo from your monologue.

- Did you like the show?

- I don't know.

"Like" is not the word.

It had a great impact on me.

- You were the one who was crying, right?

- Yes, I guess.

Sit down.

I suppose you have some questions for me.

Is Salvador alive?

How was the show tonight?

Very good, it was sold out.

Too bad the theater's small.

That's better, it's more intimate.

A very intimate spectator came tonight.

Who?

I'll tell you if you promise

to come watch me.

Who is the intimate spectator?

Federico.

Federico who?

Federico Delgado.

Your Marcelo.

He came to see me in the dressing room.

- Did he recognize the text?

- Every word.

He asked me for your number and address.

- You didn't tell him anything else?

- No.

I didn't say anything

about you chasing the dragon.

Thanks. I'll come and see you sometime.

Right.

INCOMING CALL

DECLINE - ACCEPT

CALL FROM ARGENTINA

Salvador?

- Yes.

- Is it you?

I wouldn't have recognized your voice.

It's Federico.

Federico.

I'm in Madrid.

What are you doing here?

I came to see some lawyers regarding

an inheritance. I'm leaving tomorrow night.

I would like to see you.

Me too.

But I was already in bed.

Do you mind if we meet tomorrow?

Is noon okay for you? I have the meeting

with the lawyer in the afternoon.

Perfect, yes.

I haven't asked you how you are.

Old.

Five years more than me, not one more.

And you, how are you?

I'm better now.

I was devastated when I left the theater.

I went to see The Addiction.

- And how did you know about it?

- It was a coincidence.

I took a walk around Embajadores to see

our street, I was in front of our house.

Of course.

The theater is up the street.

I went in to kill time and because I

remembered Alberto Crespo from your movie.

And you found yourself suddenly...

Yes, suddenly.

I don't know how to ask you to forgive me.

I didn't know how you felt.

How much you suffered.

It was a good learning experience.

What?

You don't have to apologize.

I didn't do anything

that I didn't want to do, Federico.

I tried to help you

- as much as I could.

- And I'm thankful,

and I would like to be able

to prove it someday.

Listen, look. I don't think

I'll be able to sleep after this.

Would you give me 20 minutes

to take a shower and get dressed,

and I'll see you at my house?

All right, yes.

Hello?

- This is Federico. Can you open the door?

- All right.

It's been so long, son of a bitch.

Come here.

Yeah.

So long.

Would you have recognized me

if you saw me on the street?

I would've had to pay attention, but yes.

You have the same eyes.

- I'm sorry I made you get out of bed.

- No, no. Come in.

It's like a museum.

Everything I've earned, I've invested it

in this house and these paintings.

- I'll give you a tour later.

- Yeah.

- What do you want to drink?

- Anything. Tequila?

Sure, tequila.

In honor of Chavela.

When you mentioned her in your monologue,

I couldn't hold my tears.

Well, all right.

Tequila for Chavela

- and to celebrate our reunion.

- Yes.

I love your house.

Where do you live now?

In Buenos Aires.

You had an uncle in Buenos Aires.

Yes, I went there in '85.

- So soon?

- Yeah.

Do you want the story now

or after we make a toast?

- Cheers.

- Cheers.

The story.

After we split up,

I lived for a year with my parents.

At the time, the heroin routes didn't come

through Argentina.

So I moved in with my uncle,

and I started working at his restaurant.

I couldn't use

because there wasn't any heroin.

So that was the best way to get clean.

I met Lucrecia, my wife.

We got married.

Now I have two older kids,

my own restaurant...

And in all these years, I've only come back

to Galicia to see my parents.

This is the first time I've come to Madrid.

As you say in your monologue,

Madrid had become

a difficult arena for me.

A minefield.

Too bad that you lived here.

I needed Madrid.

I also needed you.

But not in that state.

Love is not enough to save the person

you love, you say it in your monologue.

Let's not talk about the monologue,

it's a very sad text.

I was relieved when...

you said that while you took care of me,

you continued to evolve as a writer

and a filmmaker.

Did you really feel that way?

You didn't interrupt anything, Federico.

On the contrary,

you filled my life

like nothing and nobody...

has filled it until now.

So you hadn't come back to Madrid

since then?

No.

But I followed everything you did.

And... And I was happy

when I recognized a scene

that was clearly inspired by us.

Each one of your films was

an event in my life, and I felt proud

because you were successful

all over the world.

You are the only Spanish director

that my family knows.

Your new family.

Yes.

Do they know anything else?

Do you mean about us?

Lucrecia, my wife.

Well, my ex-wife, we're getting separated.

Yes, I told her.

She doesn't know it was you.

She knows I was with a guy in Madrid

for three years.

And I also told one of my sons

to encourage him.

In time, I'll tell him it was you.

He's a film buff and he wouldn't forgive me

if I didn't tell him.

Do you have a partner now?

Yes.

And you?

No, no.

- A man or a woman?

- A woman.

My experience with men ended with you.

I don't know how to take that.

Take it as a compliment.

This is Mauro, the youngest one.

And this is Federico.

He's 22 now.

- He looks a lot like you.

- Yeah.

He's the one I told about us.

Both very handsome.

You have to come to Buenos Aires,

you will love that city.

And I'm sure it'll inspire you.

I want you to meet my family,

to come eat at the restaurant,

to get drunk together.

For old times' sake.

Do you want me to stay tonight?

Of course I want you to.

But let's close our story as God intended.

We never cared about God, and we

can close our story tomorrow morning.

Anyway, I'm glad to see...

that I still turn you on.

Me too, you are also turned on.

Yes, go, go. Go.

Yeah, I'm going.

You're right.

As always.

Remember, you promised to come

and visit me in Buenos Aires.

Have a good trip.

- Thanks a lot for coming, really.

- I'll call you to remind you about it.

Yes, Salvador?

- Mercedes, is this a good time?

- Yes, yes, tell me.

Look, I would like to see Dr. Galindo

as soon as possible.

- What did you have?

- Nothing.

Just an anxiolytic two hours ago

and some tequila shots.

Now I'm going to take my legal dose

of crushed pills with yogurt.

Want me to make an appointment

with the gastroenterologist?

- Yes, as soon as possible.

- All right.

- All right, bye.

- Bye.

- Salvador Mallo?

- Yes.

Come this way, please.

- Thanks.

- You're welcome.

- Good morning, doctor.

- Morning, come in.

PAIN UNIT

DR. A. GALINDO

Thank you for making room for us.

It's okay. Talk to me, Salvador.

My back is killing me.

The oxycodone has almost no effect.

We'll have to change the painkiller.

How come you didn't come earlier?

- I was in a very low mood.

- Yes, he's been very depressed.

And what have you done to control the pain?

I started using heroin.

- And do you plan to keep using it?

- No. That's why I'm here.

How often were you using?

Every two or three days.

In the end, every other day.

Smoked.

- And when was the last time you used?

- The night before last.

Am I gonna have withdrawal symptoms?

A little, but with a compassionate

and controlled detox, you won't suffer.

Compassionate and controlled?

Yes, that's what it's called.

Do you have someone to assist you?

Yeah, yeah. I'll be with him.

And how have you controlled this day

and a half that you haven't used?

With anxiolytics

and an iron will.

Well,

you'll continue to need that iron will

because your mind already knows

the effect of heroin,

and that's something you don't forget.

Are you still taking Pamelor for your head?

Yes, and everything else.

For asthma, blood pressure,

insomnia, yes.

But I need you to help me especially

with my back pain.

And to put some order

in everything I'm taking.

Also with the migraines.

The back pain and headaches...

completely cripple me.

I understand.

Do you have any projects, Salvador?

Yes, improving my quality of life.

I'm talking about work.

It'd be good for you to stay busy.

Don't you miss it?

Not a day goes by that I don't think of it.

But the question is not

whether I miss it or not.

Film is a very physical job.

Unfortunately, I am in no condition

to do that. Really, that's my main problem.

- People worse off than you get ahead.

- No, I know, I know.

But I haven't been able to do it.

My mother died four years ago.

Two years later, I had back surgery.

I still haven't recovered

from either of those things.

I need help, doctor.

Okay. I'm switching the oxycodone

for a different opioid.

The idea of heroin will cross your mind.

You have to be alert.

Yes.

I'm going to extend your prescriptions

and then I'll give you the instructions.

Do you mind if I step

out and move a little?

- No, no, go ahead.

- Go on.

- Doctor, thank you very much.

- You're welcome.

- Okay, let's see.

- There's something else, doctor.

Something else?

Salvador chokes often.

An hour ago, on our way to the hospital,

he had a sip of water

and I thought he was dying.

The gastroenterologist performed

an endoscopy

and they found a lump

pressing on the esophagus.

That's why he chokes so easily,

and we don't know what the lump is.

- Does he know the result of the endoscopy?

- No.

The doctor ordered a CAT scan to be sure,

but the gastroenterologist

hasn't ruled out a tumor.

What should I do? Should I tell him?

No, no, no.

Save him at least two days of anxiety.

And please,

call me with the CAT scan results.

Sure.

Mercedes,

would you please hand me that box?

Thanks.

Salvador, it means a lot to me

that you put me in your mom's bedroom.

Here's your afternoon snack.

Those dark muffins? Forget about it.

They're whole wheat.

Someday you're going to bring me

a plate of alfalfa

because now they say

it's good for your heart.

And you're not going to drink your milk?

You have to try.

Later.

Sit down.

What are you doing?

I'm trying to disentangle these rosaries.

- Here, I'll help you.

- No. You don't know how.

- Do you remember how you need to shroud me?

- Yes, Mom, yes.

If we are in the village, you call Petra.

She's used to it.

And if I die here,

which I hope doesn't happen

because I want to die in my bed,

Maya and Mercedes will help you.

- Do we have to talk about this now?

- Yes.

On my head...

a half-circle mantilla.

Because I'm a widow.

Let me help you.

Come, I'll help you. Let's see.

There.

And the habit of Jesus of Medinaceli.

- With its cord.

- Right, with its cord.

You put a rosary in my hands.

This one, the old one.

I want you to keep the new one.

- Wouldn't you rather have the new one?

- No.

I want to be barefoot.

If they tie my feet to bury me, untie them

and tell them I asked you to do it.

I want to be very light where I'm going.

Do you remember this pen?

- Of course.

- Your father gave it to me.

I wrote all my letters with it

when we were dating.

And the wooden egg, Mom?

I wonder how much I mended with this egg.

It's the least valuable thing in here.

Well, give it to me.

Here. You just inherited it.

I think about her a lot lately.

It's the first time I've heard you say you

haven't gotten over your mother's death.

I think a lot about my childhood too.

When I'm tossing and turning,

which is most of the time,

I always end up thinking of my mother

when I was a child.

But you've never talked about her

or your childhood in your films.

- My mother didn't like that.

- You think?

She told me one of the last times

she was at the hospital.

Your legs are so clean, Mom.

I got that from my family.

No one had varicose veins in my family.

It's a shame, son.

What's that?

You won't have a good old age.

Why's that?

You're like your father's family.

Oh, Mom. The things you say.

Come on, tell me, how was your night?

So-so.

I spent all night with my neighbor Lola.

Here, in the room?

Of course not. In my dreams.

I dreamt of her all night.

I had just arrived in the village,

and I heard Lola knocking

on the door as usual

when she heard me arriving from Madrid.

Even though it was a dream,

I remembered Lola was dead.

But I opened the door.

And I found her the same as always,

even if she was a little translucent.

But I... I wasn't scared.

And I told her, "Lola,

I guess you're not okay

and you want me to do something.

But you need to tell me what

and I promise I'll do it."

"No, Jacinta. I'm fine," she said.

"But how can you be fine?" I asked her.

"If you were fine, you wouldn't appear."

"I appear to you

because my daughters get very scared."

"But how can you come to the village

when it's this cold?"

"I'm not cold or hot anymore,"

she answered.

"And there's no place like home."

"You're completely right, my friend,"

I told her.

And what else?

Don't make that narrator's face, eh?

No, no, no. I don't want you

to put any of this in your movies.

I don't want my neighbors to be in them,

I don't like autofiction.

What do you know about autofiction?

I heard you explaining it in an interview.

My neighbors don't like it

when you showcase them.

They feel you treat them like hicks.

Mom, what are you saying?

I can't treat them

with more respect and devotion.

Every opportunity I have, I talk about you

and I say I was educated by you

and the neighbors.

I owe everything to you.

They don't like it.

Let's go for a walk, you haven't moved yet.

I haven't moved

because I don't have anywhere to go.

- Now you have somewhere to go. Come on.

- Where?

To the hallway.

That's it.

You haven't been a good son, my son.

I haven't?

No.

You never forgave me for recommending you

to Paterna's lay sister.

And you took revenge for that.

I didn't want you to go

to the seminary either.

But we were poor.

It's true I didn't want to go,

but to think I wanted to get revenge?

How can you think that?

After high school,

you couldn't wait to leave for Madrid.

And when your father died,

I asked if you wanted me

to come live with you.

You dodged the question.

You said you had a lifestyle

that you couldn't share with me.

And it was true.

But not in the way you understood it.

I understood perfectly well.

I have really bad legs,

but my head works perfectly well.

When I wasn't traveling, I was filming.

You wouldn't have endured the loneliness

of an apartment in Madrid.

That was no life for you.

I would've taken care of you.

I would've adapted,

like I have adapted to so many things.

But you didn't want to.

And that hurt me.

Mom...

I'm very sorry

for not having been the kid you wanted.

When you used to say:

"Who does this kid take after?"

you didn't exactly say it with pride.

And I was aware of that.

Have I failed you

just by being the way I am?

I'm really sorry.

Pass me St. Anthony.

Tonight, I'll pray for you.

Thanks a lot.

- Salvador...

- Yes.

I brought you into this world,

and I did everything to raise you.

I know, Mom.

Take me to the village.

This is my one and only wish.

All right.

You and I will go to the village.

And Maya, to help around the house.

I'll take care of you day and night.

I won't fail you this time, Mom.

But I couldn't keep my promise.

I had to take her

to the hospital the next day.

You did everything you could.

Yeah.

But she wanted to die in the village.

And I had promised to take her.

The poor woman died

in the hospital's ICU...

alone.

They're inviting you

to give a talk in Iceland. Well paid.

I don't understand

why they like me so much in Iceland.

Me neither.

And this one is from a small gallery.

But I didn't throw it away,

I like the drawing.

Salvador Mallo?

- Yes.

- You may come in.

Sit down here, slowly.

While I hold your legs,

you turn around and lie down.

Yes, thanks.

- Hey, when does your mother get back?

- At lunchtime.

When she goes sewing

at the lay sister's house,

she stays there all morning.

Let's see.

Let's see, Salvador. Don't move.

Stay there.

Can you hold the book with both hands?

Like that.

Okay, lift your head.

What do you think?

It's very pretty.

I still have to finish it.

I'll take it home and finish it.

Yeah.

Do you mind if I wash up? Look at me.

Yeah, I'll go get the soap.

- Here.

- Thank you.

Salvador, would you bring me a towel?

I'm coming, Eduardo.

You're burning up.

You probably got sunstroke.

Salvador, what happened?

He got too much sun.

I was reading.

But you didn't realize you were in the sun?

You're burning up!

- I didn't realize.

- And you?

I finished putting up the tiles.

And when he fainted, I brought him here.

You fainted?

A little. I lost my head.

Oh, my God.

Stay here. I'll get a rag with vinegar.

And your father? At the bar?

Yes.

He told me he was staying home.

What's this bucket doing here?

I washed myself a little.

You could wait until you get to your house,

couldn't you?

It's an effort for me

to carry the water all the way here.

I was very dirty.

Should I grab a bucket and wipe the floor?

No, fetch the water, I'll wipe it.

The tiles look nice.

Yes, very nice. Thanks.

I'll get the water.

First of all, I want to reassure you,

there's no tumor.

We have completely ruled that out.

Okay, but something's wrong with me

because I even choke on puree.

Yes, what happens to you, this dysphagia,

is due to the Forestier syndrome.

You'll see it more clearly here.

You see this white part

next to the vertebra?

It's an osteophyte.

An ossification.

Here, you can see the esophagus displaced

by this ossification.

There's barely any space for food

to pass through, even liquids.

That's why you're choking.

Why has that bone grown so much there?

Forestier syndrome is a rare illness,

and we don't know what causes it.

We know it affects tendons,

ligaments and joint capsules that calcify,

but we don't know why.

In your case, the anterior ligament

of the cervical spine was calcified.

- Is there anything you can do?

- Surgery.

We need to remove that calcification

as soon as possible.

But don't worry. It's not a risky surgery.

The gastroenterologist and your surgeon

will give you more information.

- All right.

- Thank you.

POPULAR ART

Hello.

Are you interested in the watercolor?

Yes, I'd like to buy it. Who's the author?

It's anonymous.

Almost all the pieces have no signature.

How did it get here?

I bought it in the Encants market

in Barcelona.

It's one of my favorite pieces.

So you have no idea who painted it?

There's something written on the back.

But these are all anonymous artists that

probably don't even know they're artists.

Dear Salvador, I'm sending

the drawing to your house

because I don't have the school's address.

I'm happy I'm able to write to you.

You taught me how to write,

and I'm very grateful.

I'm working at Conchita's uncle's store,

and I'm good with numbers,

all thanks to you.

I have a good life here,

but I miss life in the caves

and especially you.

Every time I write,

I think about your hand guiding mine.

I'm sure you're learning a lot at school,

reading lots of books

and watching lots of movies.

Here is my address in Bilbao,

so you can write and tell me how you are.

Your student, Eduardo.

Salvador.

You have to get dressed in half an hour.

Let me know a little bit before.

THE FIRST DESIRE

What do you think

happened with the drawing?

Eduardo sent it to Paterna,

my mother probably received it.

I was already at the seminary.

She didn't send it or tell me about it.

Will you try to find him?

Eduardo?

It's easier with Google now.

Or going to Paterna and asking about him.

Fifty years later?

It's a good plot for a story,

and I may write it,

but it'd be crazy to look for him.

I wonder how the drawing ended up

in Barcelona's flea market.

I have no idea.

By chance.

What matters is that the drawing made it

to the recipient.

Salvador, what's up?

We're going to switch beds,

little by little.

Stay still.

- Very good, your head goes here.

- Yes.

- I have to open this up a little, okay?

- Okay.

And I'm gonna put some stickers

on your chest.

How are you, Salvador?

Hello, doctor.

I heard about it.

No wonder you couldn't swallow.

But don't worry, okay?

We'll take it out right away.

- Doctor.

- Talk to me.

- I'm writing again.

- Oh, really? Great news.

Yeah.

I'm really glad, Salvador.

And what is it? A drama or comedy?

I don't know.

You don't know that.

Mom?

Do you think there's a movie theater

in Paterna?

I'll settle for a house, son.

Cut.

Thirty-eight, five, first, final take.


# Call me by your name

The usurper.

Caro? He's here.

- Professor Perlman.

- Welcome, welcome.

- Thank you so much for having me.

- Oh, my goodness.

You're bigger than your picture.

Well, I couldn't get

all of me in the photo.

That's the problem.

He seems very confident.

- Mrs. Perlman.

- Annella.

Oliver. Very nice to meet you.

- Thank you for having me in your home.

- Welcome.

Where's Elio?

I'll go down.

Elio?

- You must be exhausted.

- What gave me away?

Hey.

Darling, come help Oliver

take his things up to his room.

- He's already here?

- Yes!

Every single one of these will.

Elio, Oliver. Oliver, Elio.

- How you doing?

- Nice to meet you. Elio.

You must be exhausted.

- A little bit.

- Come, come, come.

May I bring your things up to your room?

- Sure. Yeah.

- My room?

Follow him.

- You're very welcome here.

- Si.

Our home is your home.

You're leaving?

- Hello.

- Hi.

Nice to meet you.

My room is now your room.

I'll be next door.

We have to share the bathroom.

It's my only way out.

We're being called for dinner.

Sorry.

Yeah.

We're being called for dinner.

Yeah, I'm probably gonna pass.

Will you make an excuse for me

to your mom, though?

Thanks, man.

So, this is your old room, huh?

Thanks.

Later.

I'll take care of the tart.

Look at this.

Good morning, Professor.

- Good morning.

- Back from the dead.

- Was I out that long?

- It seemed like it, huh?

- How are you?

- I... Well, rested now.

- Thank you.

- I'm glad.

Would you like some espresso?

I would love some. Thank you very much.

This looks amazing.

I didn't take your seat, did I?

No, no, no. It's okay. Please.

Did you...

Did you recover from your trip?

I did. Yeah, big time.

- Thank you.

- Good.

I could show you around.

That'd be great. Thank you.

Is there a... Is there a bank in town?

I'd love to start

an account while I'm here.

Let me do it.

Sorry.

- It happens to the best of us.

- Yeah, well...

None of our residents has ever

had a local bank account.

Really?

Should I take him to Montodine?

I think they're closed

for summer vacation.

You try Crema.

Crema?

Thank you.

Is this your orchard?

These are Annella's trees.

Peaches, cherries, apricots...

Pomegranate.

Have another egg.

Oh, stupid.

No, no, no. I know myself too well.

If I have a second,

I'm just gonna have a third,

and then a fourth, and then you're just

gonna have to roll me out of here.

- Delicious.

- Darling?

Thank you.

Shall I give him Anchise's bike?

So, what does one do around here?

Wait for the summer to end.

Yeah?

What do you do in the winter?

- Wait for summer to come?

- Well, we only come here for Christmas

and some other vacations.

- Christmas? I thought you...

- And Easter as well.

- Thought you were Jewish.

- Well, we are Jewish,

but also American, Italian, French.

Somewhat atypical combination.

Besides my family, you're probably

the only other Jew

to set foot in this town.

I'm from a small town in New England.

I know what it's like

to be the odd Jew out.

So, what do you do around here?

Just read books.

Transcribe music. Swim at the river.

- Yeah?

- Go out at night.

- I don't know.

- That sounds fun.

All right, buddy, thanks for the help.

Sorry. Sorry about that.

It's all right.

All right, later.

What do you have there?

That should all be...

What is this?

These are the continuation

of these archaeology department...

These are archaeology?

Yeah, those are archaeology.

The rest of these should be history.

Okay.

- More apricot juice?

- Yeah.

- Here, tesoro.

- Thank you.

Help yourself, darling.

Thanks.

Help yourself to some more.

The word "apricot"

comes from the Arabic.

It's like the words "algebra,"

"alchemy," "alcohol."

It derives from an Arabic noun

combined with the Arabic article "al"

before it.

The origin of our Italian albicocca

is al-barquq.

It's amazing that today in Israel

and many Arab countries,

the fruit's referred to

by a totally different name, mismish.

I may have to disagree

with you there, Professor.

I'm gonna talk etymology,

so just bear with me a second.

You're right in the case

that most Latin words

do find their origins in Greek words.

However, in the case of "apricot,"

it's a little bit more

of a complicated journey.

How so?

Well, here, the Greek actually

takes over from the Latin.

Latin word being

praecoquum or precoquere.

So it's, "precook" or "pre-ripen,"

as you know.

To be precocious or premature.

And the Byzantines, to go on,

then borrowed praecox,

which became prekokkia,

which then became berikokki,

which is how the Arabs got al-barquq.

That's courtesy of Philology 101.

Flying colors.

He does this every year.

It's about drink time. Let's go here.

- Ciao, Romano.

- Ciao, Oliver.

- How are you?

- All good.

Ciao, boys!

All good?

All good!

Let's see. What have we got?

- Can you start please?

- Of course!

Good morning, gentlemen.

How do you know about this place?

Okay.

Go, Chiara!

No, no, no, no, no!

He's better than the guy

who came last year.

Remember?

Get in there!

Much better!

See how cute he is.

Elio, water!

Perfect timing.

What's the matter? Are you all right?

- What, pinch a nerve?

- I'm okay.

Here. Hold this.

Trust me. I'm about to be a doctor.

Hey, hey, come here.

See? That's the problem.

You're too stressed.

- You just gotta relax a little bit.

- I am relaxing.

Marzia, come here for a minute.

Back me up here.

- Feel that. Right there?

- Oliver.

- It's too tight, right?

- Yeah.

- He needs to relax.

- Oliver!

Later.

You should relax more.

Okay, guys, ready?

Okay, our ball, our ball, our ball.

Twelve serving 11.

Mine, mine, mine, mine.

Go, go, go. Yeah, good.

It's yours, it's yours.

Sweetheart, Auntie Marcella and

the others are coming over for dinner.

Is Oliver staying with us or going out?

Don't know.

What a movie star!

Yes, those Americans...

Sparkling wine!

He's late.

Don't you think...

Don't you think he's impolite

when he says, "Later"?

Arrogant.

I don't think he's arrogant.

Just watch.

This is how he'll say good-bye

to us when the time comes.

With his... "Later."

Meanwhile, we'll have to put up with him

for six long weeks.

Won't we, darling?

I think he's shy.

You'll grow to like him.

What if I grow to hate him?

Oh, no, sweetheart.

- Take his plates away.

- Very well, madam.

Darling?

Elio, play something.

I don't want to.

Why not?

Because I don't want to.

Why don't you go

to Moscazzano with others?

Because I don't want to.

You're spoiling everyone's fun.

Play well, darling.

- Hey.

- Hey.

What are you doing?

Reading.

How come you're not with everyone else

down by the river?

- I have an allergy. It's...

- Yeah, me too.

Maybe we have the same one.

Why don't you and I go swimming?

- Right now?

- Yeah.

Come on. Let's go.

Do we have to go right now?

- I'll go get changed.

- Okay.

Meet you downstairs.

See you downstairs.

Elio, what are you doing?

Reading my music.

No, you're not.

- Thinking, then.

- Yeah?

About what?

It's private.

You're not gonna tell me?

I'm not gonna tell you.

He's not gonna tell me

what he's thinking about.

Elio.

I guess I'll go hang out with your mom.

More apricot juice, please.

That's a good boy.

Thank God you're helping me.

Sounds nice.

Thought you didn't like it.

Play it again, will you?

Follow me.

That sounds different.

Did you change it?

- Well, I changed it a little bit.

- Why?

I just played it the way Liszt

would have played it

if he'd altered Bach's version.

Play that again.

- Play what again?

- The thing you played outside.

You want me to play

the thing I played outside?

- Please.

- Of course.

I can't believe you changed it again.

- I changed it a little bit.

- Yeah. Why?

I just played it the way

Busoni would've played it

if he'd altered Liszt's version.

And what is wrong with Bach

the way Bach would've played...

Bach never wrote it for the guitar.

In fact, we're not even sure.

- Bach wrote it at all.

- Forget I asked.

It's young Bach.

He dedicated it to his brother.

Hey, Professor.

Hello.

Here, please.

I need help.

Just be honest.

How bad is it?

I think your insights here

are persuasive, but...

Have you been to the river?

Mafalda!

Isn't she beautiful?

Elio.

You sleeping?

I was.

Listen to this drivel.

Tell me what you think.

- Wait.

- What?

Can't hear you.

"For the early Greeks,

"Heidegger contends,

this underlying hiddenness

"is constitutive of the way beings are,

"not only in relation to themselves

"but also in relation

to other entities generally.

"In other words,

they do not construe hiddenness

"merely or primarily in terms of

entities' relations to human beings."

Does that make any sense to you?

Doesn't make any sense to me.

I don't think it makes

any sense to your dad, either.

Maybe it did when you wrote it.

That might be the kindest thing

anybody has said to me in months.

"Kind"?

Yep. Kind.

- Hey, Elio.

- Hey.

Hey!

Come here.

What's going on?

Is he trying to get it on with her?

Elio, he already succeeded?

What do I know?

I'd love to be in his shoes.

Who wouldn't love to be in her shoes?

She wants him, no matter what!

Coming?

I'll come later.

Are you with me because

you're mad at Chiara?

Why would I be mad at Chiara?

Because of him.

Because of who?

Of Oliver.

Turn around.

Meet me here tomorrow night?

Wait for me!

Come on.

We almost had sex last night...

Marzia and me.

Well, why didn't you?

I don't know.

Well, you know, it's better

to have tried and failed, right?

All I had to do was find the courage

to reach out and touch.

She would have said yes.

Well, try again later.

Try what later?

I just heard

from the people in Sirmione.

They say they've come up with something.

Fantastic.

Going there today.

- Would you like to come along?

- I would love to. Thank you.

- Smell this.

- Can I come, too?

On the condition you remain silent.

Silent as in,

"He has too many opinions,"

or silent as in,

"Just not telling anybody

"what an amazing thing you've dug up"?

Well, nothing has been dug up.

It's what has been brought out,

out of the water.

What are you doing?

Going to Lake Garda with my dad.

He wants to show Oliver

where he's dredging.

Can you tell him I came by?

He's inside with my dad, helping him.

You were amazing last night,

on the dance floor.

- He's a good dancer.

- A good dancer.

He's good-looking too.

- Want to get us together?

- No.

Come in.

Dad always sits up front

with Anchise to navigate.

She seems to like you a lot.

She's more beautiful

than she was last year.

I saw her naked on a night swim once.

Great body.

Trying to get me to like her?

What would be the harm in that?

No, no harm.

Just typically like to go at those

things on my own, if you don't mind.

I'll drive today!

Just don't play at being the good host.

Anchise, take the afternoon off.

What's going on, boys?

Oliver, come. Sit up front.

Be my navigator.

What? What?

- Dr. Roseburg.

- Samuel!

- Benvenuto.

- Look who's here.

- He's grown a bit, eh?

- And this is Oliver.

Sammy! Come on!

Truce?

Hey, boys.

The ship went down in 1on the way to Isola del Garda.

Gossip has it this statue

was a gift from Count Lechi

to his lover,

contralto Adelaide Malanotte.

There are four known sets,

after the Praxiteles originals.

This fellow's at number three.

The Emperor Hadrian had a pair,

dug up at Tivoli,

but one of the more philistine

of the Farnese Popes melted them down

and had them recast as a

particularly voluptuous Venus.

Who'd like to go for a swim

before we head back?

We're all such pros. If I got my own

statue, it would probably be on there.

Elio!

Oliver!

- I have to go. I have to go.

- Hey! Hey!

I have to go.

Goodness.

- Are you going, too?

- No, no.

I should stay

and do some work on my book.

Come on. How about a drink

to celebrate the day?

- Okay, maybe just one.

- All right!

Marzia?

The Cosmic Fragments by Heraclitus.

The meaning of the river flowing

is not that all things are changing

so that we cannot encounter them twice,

but that some things

stay the same only by changing.

Sorry, Elio.

I brought some clean clothes.

Leave the door open.

- Thanks.

- You're welcome.

Darling, have you seen my Heptaméron?

Mafalda.

It's in German.

Okay.

I can't remember where we left off,

but I think you'll like this one.

Come here, darling.

So, I'll translate, huh?

"A handsome young knight

is madly in love with a princess.

"And she, too, is in love with him,

"though she seems not to be

entirely aware of it.

"Despite the friendship..."

"...that blossoms between them,

"or perhaps because of

that very friendship,

"the young knight finds himself so..."

"...so humbled and speechless

"that he's totally unable to bring up

the subject of his love.

"Till one day, he asks the princess

point-blank..."

"Is it better to speak or to die?"

I'd never have the courage

to ask a question like that.

I doubt that.

Hey, Elly-Belly.

You do know that

you can always talk to us.

My mom's been reading

this 16th-century French romance.

She read some of it to my dad and I

the day the lights went out.

Yeah, about the knight that doesn't know

whether to speak or die?

Right.

So, does he or doesn't he?

"Better to speak," she said.

But she's on her guard.

She senses a trap somewhere.

So, does he speak?

No.

He fudges.

It figures. He's French.

I gotta go to town in a little bit

to pick some things up.

I can go. I'm not doing anything today.

Then why don't we go together?

Right now?

Yeah. Right now.

That is, of course, unless you have

more important business going on.

"That is, of course, unless you have

more important business going on."

Mind if I put this in your bag?

Yes, please.

I straightened the wheels

and inflated the tires.

Perfect. Thanks.

I fell. I was coming home the other day,

and I scraped myself pretty badly.

Anchise insisted on applying

some sort of witches' brew.

I think it helped.

Hold this for a second, will you?

- Want one?

- Sure.

Not bad, huh?

Not bad at all.

I thought you didn't smoke.

I don't.

- So, World War II, huh?

- No. This is World War I.

You'd have to be at least 80 years old

to have known any of them.

I never even heard

of the Battle of Piave.

Battle of Piave was one of the most

lethal battles of World War I.

Hundred and seventy thousand

people died.

Is there anything you don't know?

I know nothing, Oliver.

Well, you seem to know

more than anybody else around here.

Well, if you only knew how little

I know about the things that matter.

What things that matter?

You know what things.

Why are you telling me this?

'Cause I thought you should know.

Because you thought I should know?

'Cause I wanted you to know?

Because I wanted you to know.

Because I wanted you to know.

'Cause I wanted you to know.

Because there's no one else

I can say this to but you.

Are you saying

what I think you're saying?

Don't go anywhere. Stay right here.

You know I'm not going anywhere.

They mixed up all of my pages.

I'm gonna have to

retype this whole thing.

I'm not gonna have anything to work on

this afternoon.

This is gonna set me back a whole day.

Damn it.

Shouldn't have said anything.

Just pretend you never did.

Does that mean we're on speaking terms

but not really?

It means we can't talk

about those kinds of things.

Okay?

We just can't.

Hey.

Let's go, American!

- Ready?

- Let's go.

Pretty much.

Oh, my God.

- Thirsty?

- Yeah.

Good morning, ma'am.

Excuse me.

Could I ask for a glass of water?

I'll Duce.

"People of Italy!"

That's Italy.

- Thank you.

- You're welcome.

Come on!

This is my spot. It's all mine.

Come here to read.

Can't tell you the number of books

I've read here.

Oh, my God, it's freezing.

Spring is in the mountains.

The Alpi Orobie.

The water comes

straight down from there.

I like the way you say things.

I don't know why you're always

putting yourself down, though.

So you won't, I guess.

You really that afraid of what I think?

You're making things

very difficult for me.

I love this, Oliver.

What?

Everything.

Us, you mean?

It's not bad.

It's not bad.

Better now?

No, no, no.

- We should go.

- Why?

I know myself. Okay?

And we've been good.

We haven't done anything

to be ashamed of,

and that's a good thing.

I wanna be good.

Okay?

Am I offending you?

Just don't.

I think it's starting to get infected.

We can stop by the pharmacist's

on the way back.

Excellent idea.

So we got the government

of Bettino Craxi...

Because we don't do anything

but talk, talk, talk.

Let me speak.

We have five parties

that do nothing but fight.

Smoke and shut up!

Let them speak, him, her.

I'd like to know what they think too.

Annella, what do you think?

A five party government!

Darling, I think

it's the historic compromise...

Don't say that. Compromises are tragic.

You've changed

since you inherited this place.

What's that got to do with it?

What are you saying?

You're mad, darling.

You asshole!

- She's right.

- And you don't say anything to her.

Say something.

You're resigned.

Why don't we talk

about the death of Buñuel?

Buñuel was a genius.

- Know him?

- Cinema isn't the answer.

Cinema is a mirror of reality

and it's a filter.

They broadcast The Phantom of Liberty

with constant interr...

Everyone loves Buñuel!

Let's hear his opinion.

He doesn't know anything about Italy!

Say something. Give us your impression.

Do you have an impression?

Darling, he's American.

That doesn't mean stupid!

Just stop.

I don't give an easy ride

to some politicians.

She didn't say that.

I'm going to go mad.

What's the matter?

What's wrong?

It's nothing. It happens all the time.

- Mafalda, ice?

- It's in the fridge.

You get used to absolutely everything.

Don't you realize

you're mixing everything up?

What are you talking about?

There's no more politics, nothing.

He's left too.

Elio?

Elio.

You all right?

Sit for a second.

If you insist.

- That wasn't my fault, right?

- No.

I'm a mess.

Well, the kitchen table sure is.

Where did you learn to do that?

My bubbe used to do this for us

when we were sick.

Trust me, it helps.

I used to have one of these.

- You used to?

- Yeah.

How come you never wear it?

My mother says

we are Jews of discretion.

Well...

I guess that works for your mother.

Funny witch.

Fuck, you'll kill me if you do that.

I hope not.

Hey, are you leaving?

- Where's Elio?

- He's inside.

He had a bit of a nosebleed

during lunch, and he's just resting.

- Really?

- Yeah.

- Okay. Bye.

- I'll be back in a minute.

Don't go anywhere.

You okay?

Are we going out?

I don't know if I can go out.

If my mom sees, she'll worry.

- She will?

- Yeah, she's a pain.

Where's Oliver?

Don't ask me.

Where's Oliver?

- Didn't he go out?

- Would you like a smoothie?

No, thank you. We're having dinner soon.

All right.

I'm going out tonight.

- Don't make me worry.

- What are you talking about?

This is no good, madam.

- Let him do his own thing.

- Fine.

Why's she hassling me? I'm 17.

She's worried about you.

You like him, don't you? Oliver?

Everyone likes Oliver.

I think he likes you too.

More than you do.

Is that your impression?

- No, he told me.

- When did he say that?

A while ago.

Mafalda, do you know where Oliver is?

I have no idea.

Traitor.

Traitor.

This is Craxi.

I draw the center of Craxi...

- Hey.

- Hi!

It's me. Is that Marzia?

Sure it is! Can't you tell?

Sorry.

Is that for me?

Thanks.

Do you really read a lot?

I love reading too,

but I don't tell anyone.

Why not?

I don't know.

I think...

people who read are...

kind of secretive.

They hide who they really are.

Do you hide who you really are?

No, not with you.

Not with me?

Well, maybe a bit.

What do you mean?

You know exactly what I mean.

Why do you say that?

Why?

Because...

I think...

you're going to hurt me,

and I don't want to be hurt.

You're so hard.

Wait.

Kiss me.

- Is that good?

- Yes.

Are you lying?

- Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.

- It's all right.

Are you mad at me? Are you angry?

What's so funny? Why are you laughing?

Leave me alone.

Fuck, that felt good.

Please don't avoid me.

It kills me.

Can't stand thinking you hate me.

Your silence is killing me.

I'd sooner die than know you hate me.

I am such a pussy.

Way over the top.

Can't stand the silence.

Need to speak to you.

Did someone have a good night

last night?

Not really.

Well, you must be tired, then.

Or were you playing poker, too?

I don't play poker.

Several hundred color slides

of our boxer and the others like him

arrived yesterday from Berlin.

We should start cataloging them.

That'll keep us busy till lunch,

I imagine.

Sure.

Beautiful, aren't they?

They're all so incredibly sensual.

Because these are more Hellenistic

than 5th century Athenian.

Most likely sculpted

under the influence of Praxiteles.

Right.

Greatest sculptor in antiquity.

Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.

Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.

Muscles are firm.

Look at his stomach, for example.

Not a straight body in these statues.

They're all curved.

Sometimes impossibly curved.

And so nonchalant.

Hence their ageless ambiguity.

As if they're daring you to desire them.

Don't forget, Isaac and Mounir

are coming for dinner.

- Also known as Sonny and Cher.

- Okay.

I'd like you to wear that shirt

they gave you for your birthday.

No.

- Darling, they got it for you in Miami.

- I'm sorry. It's too big. It's too big.

- Come on. It will make them so happy.

- It looks ridiculous on me.

I'll try it on for Oliver.

If Oliver thinks

I look like a scarecrow in it,

I'm not wearing it.

Oliver?

Hey, what time you got?

It's 2:00.

- Well... Later.

- Later.

Mafalda.

I won't be here for dinner.

Okay, Mr. Oliver.

Hello, Mafalda.

Marzia.

Where are we going?

You'll see.

Stop it!

- How are you, buddy?

- Hey!

- It's been ages.

- It has, yes.

- How are you?

- You've grown.

- How are you.

- I'm good.

Good to see you.

Remember Marzia from last year.

Hello.

- Marzia, remember Isaac?

- The girl from Paris?

Good to meet you.

Want to eat with us tonight?

No, no. I have to go.

- You're sure?

- Yes.

- Okay.

- Have a nice evening.

Goodbye.

This right here is the brand-new china

that you guys so kindly sent to us.

It looks wonderful.

Come here, Mounir, Mounir.

- Come, come, come.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I can't put it on now.

They've already met me.

- Yes, you can.

- It'll look like a put-up job.

- Papa, it'll...

- Yes.

- Papa, it'll look like a put-up job.

- No misbehaving tonight.

No... No laughing.

When I tell you to play, you'll play.

You're too old not to accept

people for who they are.

What's wrong with them?

What's wrong with them?

You call them Sonny and Cher

behind their backs.

- That's what Mom calls them...

- Then you accept gifts from them.

The only person that reflects badly on

is you.

Is it because they're gay

or because they're ridiculous?

If you know as much about economics

at Mounir's age,

you'll be a very wise man, indeed.

And a credit to me.

Now, just get into this, you.

These are unbelievable. I just...

Hey, look who's here.

Sorry. I have to go to bed.

I'm sorry. I'm so tired.

Thank you.

Elio. Elio.

- Thank you.

- Good night.

Good night.

Do I know you?

Thank you again for everything.

- They're never gonna make it.

- No, no. They're fine.

I'm glad you came.

Yeah, I'm nervous.

I like what you've done with the place.

It's nice.

You okay?

Me okay.

- Can I kiss you?

- Yes, please.

What are you doing?

Nothing.

Does this make you happy?

You're not gonna get

a nosebleed on me, are you?

I'm not gonna get...

Off, off, off, off, off.

Yeah. Just pull it.

Or I'll pull it.

Oliver.

Call me by your name,

and I'll call you by mine.

Elio.

Oliver.

Elio.

- Oliver.

- Elio.

Did we make noise?

Nothing to worry about.

I don't know.

Mafalda always looks for signs.

Well, she's not gonna find any.

You wore that shirt

the first day you were here.

Will you give it to me when you go?

Let's go swimming.

Are you gonna hold

what happened last night against me?

No.

Elio. Come here.

Take your trunks off.

Well, that's promising.

You're hard again.

Good.

Professor, I got your note.

Thank you for reminding me.

I'm gonna go into town and pick

up those typed pages today,

so maybe this afternoon

would be a good time to...

Later.

We'll look them over later,

before you leave.

Okay. So later.

Later.

Oliver.

You're not sick of me yet?

No, I just...

I just wanted to be with you.

I'll... I'm gonna... I'll go.

Do you know how happy I am

that we slept together?

I don't know.

Of course, you don't know.

I don't want you to regret anything.

And I hate the thought that maybe

I may have messed you up or...

I don't want either of us

to pay for this,

- one way or another.

- No, I...

It's not like

I'm gonna tell anyone.

You're not gonna be, like,

getting in trouble.

That's not what I'm talking about.

Are you happy I came here?

I would kiss you if I could.

Times change.

Thank God we had the partisans.

I know, but times have changed.

It's different.

What do you think of Bettino?

- I don't like him.

- I like him.

I'm happy, actually.

I don't know. We'll see.

Anyway, they make the rules.

Pasquina!

Hello.

Hello, ma'am.

- Tortelli cremaschi.

- Yes.

Oh, fuck.

Fuck.

Fuck.

What did you do?

- Nothing.

- No?

Oh, I see.

You've moved on

to the plant kingdom already.

What's next? Minerals?

I suppose you've already

given up animals.

You know that's me.

I'm sick, aren't I?

I wish everybody was as sick as you.

Please don't do that.

- You want to see something sick?

- Please don't do that.

You want to see something sick?

Please don't do this.

Hey. Please don't do it.

Why are you doing this to me?

- What are you doing?

- Stop.

- You're fucking hurting me.

- Then don't fight.

Sorry.

It's okay.

It's okay.

It's okay.

I don't want you to go.

God, we wasted so many days.

Why didn't you give me a sign?

- I did. I did.

- You didn't give me a sign.

When?

You remember

when we were playing volleyball

and I touched you?

Just to show you that I liked you?

And the way you reacted

made me feel like I'd molested you.

- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

- No, it's fine.

I just decided

I should keep my distance.

I don't know.

I come out here for hours

almost every night.

I didn't know that.

That's funny, I...

I thought that...

Yeah, I know what you thought.

Stop. Stop.

"For Oliver.

"From Elio."

Elio?

You disappeared for three days.

I had to work.

You completely disappeared.

Yeah, I don't know. I just...

I had a lot to do.

Am I your girl?

Oliver has to go to Bergamo

for a few days.

Research at the university.

Then he'll fly home from Linate.

But what about Elio?

Maybe it could be nice

for the two of them

to get away for a couple of days, no?

What do you think?

You know you've been

our favorite student?

- You must come back.

- You sure you're not just saying that?

- Oliver.

- Thank you very much, Professor.

Oh, man.

Please, please come back soon.

Come back? I'm just going home to pack.

I'm moving here.

You're welcome.

Oh, well...

- Thank you guys so much.

- Of course.

Oliver, Oliver.

- Come back.

- It's been...

Come here, come here.

It's been amazing. Thank you guys.

Well, later, Perlmans.

Later. Later, later, later.

Tell Elio to call when you get there.

Oh, no.

Come for dinner tonight.

Bring Marzia.

Bye, darling.

- What?

- Nothing.

- What?

- Nothing.

Oh, to see without my eyes.

The first time that you kissed me.

Boundless by the time I cried.

I built your walls around me.

Yes!

White noise

What an awful sound

Oliver!

Elio!

Elio!

Hand of God, deliver me.

Oh, woe is me.

The first time that you touched me.

- Oliver!

- Elio!

Oh, will wonders never cease?

Blessed be the mystery of love.

Lord, I no longer believe.

Yes!

Drowned in living waters.

Cursed by the love that I received.

From my brother's daughter.

Like Hephaestion who died.

Alexander's lover.

Now I'm prone to misery.

The birthmark on your...

Oh, God.

And I'm feeling low.

Understand I'm feeling low.

You hear that?

Wait, wait, wait.

No, no, no, it's this way.

Come on. Come on. You're missing it.

Come on.

Don't stop.

A kiss is not enough...

This. This.

This. You.

You are...

Love my way.

It's a new road.

I follow...

If you'll excuse me...

Just one second.

One second!

They'd dearly make us pay.

For laughing in their faces.

And making it our way.

There's emptiness behind their eyes.

There's dust in all their hearts

I saw them last year.

Richard Butler... fantastic!

Really? We saw them in concert too.

We hitchhiked to London.

What'd she say?

It's a new road

I follow.

Where my mind goes.

Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

Did you get your passport?

You get your passport?

Mafalda?

Mom?

Yeah, it's me.

Yeah, everything is fine.

I'm at the station...

in Clusone.

Listen, Mom, can you...

Can you come get me, Mom?

How are you?

Good.

I read the book you bought me.

The poems...

They're really beautiful.

I love that... Antonia Pozzi.

I'm sorry, excuse me...

that you're sad.

I'm saying that because

I wanted to tell you

I'm not mad at you.

Not at all.

I love you, Elio.

Stay friends?

For life?

For life?

Missed you at dinner.

So...

Welcome home.

Thanks.

- Oliver enjoyed the trip?

- Yeah.

I think he did.

You two had a nice friendship.

Yeah.

You're too smart not to know how rare,

how special what you two had was.

Oliver was Oliver.

Because it was him.

Because it was me.

Oliver may be very intelligent but...

He was more than intelligent.

What you two had,

had everything and nothing

to do with intelligence.

He was good.

You're both lucky

to have found each other

because you, too, are good...

I think he was better than...

I think he was better than me.

I'm sure he'd say

the same thing about you.

Yeah. He'd say the same thing.

It flatters you both.

And when you least expect it,

nature has cunning ways

of finding our weakest spot.

Just remember, I am here.

Right now,

you may not wanna feel anything,

maybe you never wanted to feel anything.

And maybe it's not to me

you'd want to speak about this things

but feel something you obviously did.

Look, you had a beautiful friendship.

Maybe more than a friendship.

And I envy you.

In my place, most parents would hope

the whole thing goes away.

Pray their sons land on their feet,

but I am not such a parent.

We rip out so much of ourselves

to be cured of things faster,

that we go bankrupt by the age of 30.

And have less to offer,

each time we start with someone new.

But to make yourself feel nothing

so as not to feel anything.

What a waste.

Have I spoken out of turn?

And I'll say one more thing,

it'll clear the air.

I may have come close

but I never had what you two have.

Something always held me back

or stood in the way.

How you live your life is your business.

Just remember,

our hearts and our bodies

are given to us only once,

and before you know it,

your heart's worn out.

And as for your body,

there comes a point

when no one looks at it

much less wants to come near it.

Right now, there's sorrow, pain.

Don't kill it,

and with it, the joy you felt.

Does Mom know?

I don't think she does.

- Have you been to the Gaverine?

- Yes.

Latkes.

- May I?

- Happy Hanukkah!

To you too.

She looks a bit weak.

She comes highly recommended by...

Her special area of study is...

I'll get it.

Hello?

Elio, you there?

- Hi.

- Hey.

- How are you.

- I'm good.

I'm good. How are you?

- How are your parents?

- I'm good. They're fine.

Good.

I miss you.

I miss you too.

Very much.

- I have some news.

- News?

What, you're getting married?

I suppose.

I might be getting married

next spring, yeah.

You never said anything.

Been off and on for three years.

That's wonderful news.

Do you mind?

- Oliver.

- Oliver.

- Oliver.

- Hey, hey, hey.

Darling, when are you coming back?

I wish I was.

You caught us in the process of choosing

the new you for next summer.

- And guess what? He's a she.

- Oh, no.

Speaking of she's, I'm calling

to tell you guys I got engaged.

Wonderful!

- Congratulations.

- Mazel tov!

- Congratulations, Oliver.

- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Listen, we'll leave you...

We'll let you speak to Elio.

- Happy Hanukkah!

- Happy Hanukkah!

Bye, sweetheart.

They know about us.

I figured.

How?

Well, from the way your dad spoke to me.

He made me feel

like I was a part of the family.

Almost like a son-in-law.

You're so lucky.

My father would have carted me off

to a correctional facility.

Elio.

Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.

Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.

Oliver.

I remember everything.

Elio.

Elio.


# Maurice

Thank you.

Hall, come here please.

Sir?

Come on.

Have a good send off?

Yes sir, thank you sir.

Mr. Abrahams gave me a picture,

the light of the world.

The fellas have given

me a set of Guatemalas.

Up to two dollars!

The ones with the parrot

and the pillar on.

Look, sir.

Oh, splendid, splendid.

And um, what did Mr. Abrahams

say to you?

Told you you were a

miserable sinner, I hope.

Mr. Abrahams said

I'm never to do anything

I'd be ashamed to do

in front of my mother.

He said my next school will

be more like the world.

Did he, did he?

What's the world like,

do you suppose?

Don't know, sir, I'm a boy.

Do you, um, have any

older brothers, Hall?

No, sir, only Kitty and Ada.

They're my sisters, sir.

No uncles?

No, sir.

There's Dr. Barry.

He knew my father

before he died.

So you don't really know a

great many grown-up fellows.

No, not really, sir.

Mother keeps a coachman,

and George for the garden.

But of course, you mean gentlemen.

Hall, I'm going to talk

to you for a few moments

as if I were your father.

It isn't anything

your mother could say.

Do you, do you see?

Your body, is about to experience

various changes, physical changes.

Now, Mr. Abrahams has explained

to you that in the beginning,

"God created he man and woman,

"that the earth should

be peopled abundantly."

Yes sir, Sir...

what changes?

I speak, Hall, of the

sacred mystery of sex,

the act of procreation

between a man and his wife.

The procreation indeed

of all creeping things.

You will discover that

your membrum virilis,

that's Latin from vir.

Vir, sir, it means man, sir.

Very good, very good.

Um, uh, look.

Uh, this might be easier if I...

That, that, that, um, that thing.

There, now, that will...

develop and grow larger.

You see?

And when that happens, the man lies

very, very close to his wife,

and he puts his membrum

virilis into her vagina...

thus.

Then, in due course, she

will bring forth his child.

Seminiferous tubules,

labia major and minor, ducts...

vulva.

That, that is the very

crown of life, Hall.

God's wondrous purpose.

Your body is his temple.

You must never, ever

pollute that temple.

And when,

as one day I'm sure you will,

you fall in love and

marry, you will discover

to serve and protect a woman,

and have children by her,

is life's chiefest glory.

Yes, sir.

You must never,

ever mention any of this

to your mother,

or, or, or indeed to any lady.

And if at your next school

the fellows mention it,

just shut them up.

Tell them you know.

I think I shan't marry.

What?

Look, um, in 10 years to the day,

I invite you and your wife to dine

with me and my wife as our guests.

What do you say?

Oh, sir.

Yes, it's

a bargain then, is it?

Oh, God, those infernal designs.

Sir, won't they be all right?

The tide will have

covered them by now.

Oh,

yes, the rising tide.

I only hope to God he's right, by God.

Come, Victoria, come.

Wagner's utter rubbish.

Fat women with horns on their heads,

singing at the tops of their voices

about how happy they are to be dying.

It's a horrible noise,

and it's unhealthy.

But music is

about death, it always has been.

I think

he's trying to provoke us.

Go on then, Risley, enlighten us.

A superior mind wouldn't

need enlightening.

Music is the highest of the arts.

It needs no reference to the

figurative, or the corporeal.

It is therefore, of all the arts,

the closest to death.

Wagner's by no means unhealthy.

He's merely expressing

most exactly the state of things.

Help

yourselves to potatoes, Hall.

Don't stand on ceremony.

I can't stand music.

Or concert halls.

I don't go in for being superior.

Don't you?

I do.

Come along, Chapman,

you're in need of food.

I expect Lord Risley isn't.

I've put him off with my low talk.

I simply can't think

of a reply to that.

What about saying nothing?

Say nothing?

Horrible, he must be mad.

What you do is more

important than what you say.

Your deeds are more important

than your words.

What is the difference?

Words are deeds.

Are you trying to say

that these few minutes

talking in the dean's rooms

have done nothing for you?

Will you, for instance,

ever forget that you've met me?

You're confusing what is important

with what is impressive.

Chapman and Hall will always remember

they've met you,

of that I have no doubt.

Exactly, because of my conversation.

Oh, they'll forget that

they were engaged

in the act of eating a cutlet.

At least the cutlet

does some good to them.

You do not.

I mean, Dean, that a cutlet

merely influences

their subconscious life.

I, by my words,

shape the consciousness.

I am therefore not only

more impressive than the cutlet,

but infinitely more important.

Your dean here dwells

in superstitious clouds

of Christian self-righteousness.

Your dean pretends that

only insensate faith

is of any significance.

And daily he droops,

soporific, into his soup.

Oh, Risley, shut up.

Come on.

I think if a man

has ideas like that,

he should have the courtesy

to keep them to himself.

No, no, no, on the contrary,

one must talk, talk, talk.

It's only by talking that we

shall caper upon the summit.

Otherwise the mountains

will overshadow us.

I'm sure, Hall, you will agree.

Wait.

I'm eager to hear

more of your interesting ideas

about words and deeds.

My rooms are in Trinity.

And I have a dining club

whose members would,

if I'm not mistaken, interest you.

No need to bring your chum.

Oh, well.

You're not going, are you?

Salutations, Risley.

You've bargained for

more than you've gained.

Risley.

You've, uh, you've bargained

for more than you've gained.

Salutations.

Look.

Come in.

Hello?

You're Durham, aren't you?

Yes.

I was looking for Risley,

don't know where he is.

He's debating at the Union.

I was just stealing

his pathetic symphony.

I'm reading a paper on Tchaikovsky,

but I cannot find the third movement.

If it's here at all,

which I don't think it is.

Featherstonhaugh's got a Pianola.

I know.

His rooms are directly above mine.

Oh, well, I'll come back

with you then.

You're living in college now?

Beginning my second year.

I'm third.

I have seen you, though.

Hall, isn't it?

If Risley's not coming,

perhaps I'd better get back.

I didn't know you knew Risley.

He's a dangerous man.

A little of him certainly

goes a very long way.

You like this music?

I'm afraid I do, yes.

Sweet water from a foul well,

as they say.

A good waltz is more my style.

Hmm, mine too, really.

Thank you, good night.

Good night, sir.

Hall.

Oh, got your third movement.

I thought I'd come

along with you instead.

Here, give me some of those

to carry.

It's all right, I think

I've got them safe now.

Good night.

Good night, sir.

Give.

Mortarboard.

This bit's supposed to be mad.

Hall.

You, you should be at this end.

You should get as far away

from the machine as you can.

Play it again.

If Featherstonhaugh

doesn't mind, that is.

No, you can't play it again.

It's a, it's a movement.

You have to get right to the end.

Featherstonhaugh, I think I'm

gonna eat one of your apples.

Is this Sophocles?

Mm.

Try reading it for the

characters, rather than the author.

It's much more interesting.

Much too fast, Hall.

Slower, slower.

There, otherwise you'll tear it.

This bit isn't as jolly,

really, is it?

No, it's not.

Appalling vac.

I nearly wrote to you about it.

My mother started flinging

the cat about

because I wouldn't go to

Communion on Christmas Day.

I mean, I'm unorthodox.

I'm not a Christian.

It was imperative that I made a stand.

It's a difficult question.

Hall, come down to the buttery.

Oh, hello, Durham.

Halliday's been given a

case of hock for Christmas.

Reward for good behavior over the vac.

He's asked for us.

I'm sorry, Chapman, not now.

We're fixing something.

Oh, I see.

Sorry, well, perhaps

we'll see you later, then.

Have you known Chapman long?

Five years,

here and at school.

Give me a cigarette, would you?

I mean, you've got a mother

and sisters.

All the way through that row

I was thinking what you

would have done.

My mother never

makes a row about anything.

That's 'cause you've never

done anything

she wouldn't approve, I expect.

You never will.

I'm disgusted with mine.

I despise her character.

There, I've told you something

no one else in the world knows.

Won't tell.

Tell me about your home life.

Nothing to say.

We just go on.

Lucky devils.

Rotten vac, eh?

Yes, it was, rotten.

Misery and hell.

Ow, that really hurt, ow!

Misery and hell, eh?

Hall, what are you,

No, no, Hall, no.

Please, I've got to go.

Don't be such a fool.

I've got to go,

I said I've got a lecture.

Why don't you go late again?

Because I can't.

You think I don't think.

But I can tell you I do.

"Every human soul has

"at some stage beheld

an excellent being.

"Otherwise, it would not have

"entered into the creature

"we call man.

"When the soul

"gazes upon the beauty

"of that being, its beloved

"it nu, is nurtured

"and warmed, and is glad."

Featherstonhaugh, continue, please.

"When the beloved

has made him welcome

"and begun to enjoy

his conversation and--"

"Society."

"Society."

"When their intimacy is

"established

"and the loved one

"has grown used

"to being near his friend,

"and touching him in

"the gymnasium and elsewhere,

"the current which Zeus

in love with Ganymede

"called 'the stream of longing."'

Omit the reference to the

unspeakable vice of the Greeks.

Ah, yes, sir.

"He, he is experiencing a counterlove,

"a reflection of the love he inspires,

"and he thinks of it as

friendship, not love.

"Though, like his lover,

"he feels a desire to see,

to touch, to kiss him."

"The unspeakable

vice of the Greeks"?

The hypocrisy of the man.

He ought to lose his fellowship.

Oh, come on!

No, as a point of pure scholarship.

All the poor old dean can understand

is the physical act.

I'm not advocating that.

Cold as a fish on a marble

slab, you see?

Shut up, Risley.

I'm trying to make

a serious point here,

which is that a masculine love

of physical beauty

and of moral beauty,

and of the beauty of the

thirst for human knowledge,

you omit that and you've omitted

the mainstay of Athenian society.

It's as if our benighted dean

hadn't even read The Symposium.

You read it, Hall?

No, no, you missed the point.

You have to maintain some

standards of decency.

No, you don't.

Not if they're propped

up by tenth-hand opinion.

Typical of you, I may say.

Western civilization happens

to be run on the principles

of Christ's doctrines, not

Plato's bloody essences.

What exactly do you mean

by Christ's doctrines?

They're open to all

sorts of interpretations.

You know, the redemption,

the Trinity.

♪ Three in one

♪ And one in three

♪ Ruler of the earth and sea

♪ Hear us while ♪

Damn Christ's doctrines.

I can't prove them,

but they mean a lot

to millions of people,

whatever you say.

♪ Holy Child and Son ♪

♪ Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord ♪

Hall.

♪ And my mouth shall show thy praise

♪ For thou desirest no sacrifice

♪ Else would I

♪ Give it thee

♪ But thou delightest not

♪ In burnt offerings ♪

That was enormously embarrassing.

I did actually say at 6:00.

You just made me walk out of chapel.

I just don't understand it.

Your father always went to church.

I can't help it, Mother.

I'm made that way.

There's no use arguing.

Durham.

I wonder if that's

Alicia Durham's brother.

Besides, I'm not my father.

Morrie.

What a thing to say.

Well, he isn't.

Really, Mother, come on.

Kitty, we are talking

about things not suited,

and you are perfectly wrong

Besides, Morrie is the

image of his father.

Dr. Barry said so.

Dr. Barry doesn't go

to church himself.

Dr. Barry is a most clever man,

and so is Mrs. Barry.

Imagine Mrs. Barry being a man.

Have you been all right?

Have you?

No.

You wrote that you were.

Hall!

Here.

We want tea, we need tea!

We demand tea!

Hello, Durham.

A glorious

match, we're absolute heroes.

Peterhouse are abject.

And wonderful wicket-keeping.

Don't you have any Darjeeling, Hall?

I don't like this Chinese bilge.

A marvelous match.

Best so far.

If it hadn't been for my two valiant

catches in the slips--

Three wickets.

Just dropping them

into the rough spot.

It was too easy.

Hall, Hall.

Durham, where did you get to?

I know you read those books

in the vac.

How do you mean?

You'll understand then,

I don't have to explain.

Understand what?

That I love you.

Don't talk rubbish.

Durham?

Durham, come back!

Come on, old man.

Amen.

Clive, you're bloody hard.

You don't know what it is

to have a mind in a mess.

It makes you very hard.

Hall, don't be so stupid.

You must know that to be

alone with you hurts me.

I only want to discuss--

No, please don't reopen it.

It's over.

I'm in hell.

Oh, get out.

It's only disgust.

You haven't done anything

to be ashamed of.

You don't know

what hell's really like.

I thought it was the

worst crime in the calendar.

The one subject absolutely

beyond the limit.

Look, you've been thoroughly

decent from first to last.

So decent that I mistook

your friendliness.

I thought it was, something else.

I'm sorry to have insulted you.

Durham, I love you,

in my very own way.

Rubbish, as you so rightly said.

Good night.

I do.

I think I have always.

Look.

It's like the good,

blundering creature

that you are to try to comfort

me, but there are limits.

I'm thankful that it was

into your hands I fell.

Most men would have

reported me to the dean,

or the police.

Damn you, Durham.

Maurice.

I love you.

I love you.

Hall.

It's the dean.

Don't you have a lecture?

I overslept!

Hall! Stop when I

speak to you!

Do you realize,

I,

I would have gone

through life half-awake

if you'd had the decency

to leave me alone?

Why me?

Perhaps we woke up each other.

No.

Can't you kiss me?

I think, I think it would bring us,

I think it would bring us down.

I think it would spoil everything.

This harmony.

Body,

mind, soul.

I don't think women have even guessed.

But you know.

Why did you not stop

when I called you?

Yesterday you cut chapel,

four lectures,

including my own translation class.

And, Hall, you've done

this sort of thing before.

It's unnecessary to add

impertinence, don't you think?

Very well.

I'm sending you down.

You will catch the 12 o'clock.

Unless you write me

a letter of apology,

I shall not recommend your readmission

to college in October.

If it had been a girl

in the sidecar,

Cornwallis would never

have kicked up a stink.

Everyone cuts lectures.

I've done nothing wrong.

I refuse to say that I have.

What'll you do?

Go into the stock

market like Father did.

I don't need one of their

rotten degrees.

You will come to Pendersleigh?

Bye!

Boo-hoo-hoo.

Not quite

what you expected, eh?

Dr. Barry, not quite as

anyone expected.

Still, these past few weeks,

it's become apparent to me that

it's time a man was here to

head this household again.

Well, it's all for the best.

What do you want with a degree?

They were never meant

for the suburban classes.

I mean, you're not

going to become a parson

or a barrister or a

pedagogue, and you're not a,

you're not a country gentleman.

No, it's a sheer waste of time.

The city's your place.

Absolutely right to insult the dean.

If anything,

I've been insulted by him.

Treated like a schoolboy.

You see, your mother doesn't

understand how you feel.

She's worried because

you don't apologize.

To my mind, these things

work themselves out.

You see, you've got

yourself into an atmosphere

for which you were not suited,

and you very properly took

the first chance to get out.

How do you mean?

Oh, still not clear?

I mean that a gentleman would

have apologized by instinct

if he'd found that he'd

behaved as you did.

I think it's time I turned in.

How dare you bully

your mother, Maurice.

You ought to be horsewhipped.

Swaggering about instead of

begging her to forgive you.

She comes to me with tears in her eyes

and asks me to say something.

But--

Don't answer me, sir,

don't answer me.

I want none of your speech.

You're a disgrace to chivalry.

Oh!

I'm disappointed

and disgusted with you.

Oh, Morrie darling,

we all looked forward

so much to May Week.

Mother, do stop crying.

It'll only make him

think he's important.

He'll write to the dean as

soon as no one wants him to.

Kitty, I won't.

I don't see why you shouldn't.

Little girls don't see a great deal.

I see a great deal

more than some little boys

who think they're little men.

Mrs. Sheepshanks.

Oh, how very complimentary.

Thank you so much.

Skeggs, Olivia.

Woolly, dear.

I think everyone

should curtsy, don't you?

I've had such an interesting

talk with Mr. Hall.

And isn't Clive handsome?

Mother, this is Maurice Hall.

Welcome to Pendersleigh, Mr. Hall.

How do you do?

Woolly.

Yes, it's so lovely

to see you.

No, leave those, come on.

Oh, by the way,

if my mother or my sister ask you

to do this or that tomorrow,

don't worry.

Say yes if you want,

but you're actually

going to ride with me,

and they know it.

It's just their ritual.

But I haven't brought

any riding breeches.

Ah, well, I can't associate

with you in that case.

Deep breath.

You must be Mr. Hall.

I'm Pippa Durham, Clive's sister.

Yes, he's--

May I introduce Mr. London?

Mr. Hall.

How do you do?

Archie London.

How do you do?

I'm the lucky devil

who's to marry her.

I'm commandeering troops

for canvassing tomorrow,

tariff reform.

Yes,

stop bullying, Pippa.

Are you interested?

Certainly, I'd be delighted.

Good, there, Mama.

Mr. Hall is sound.

Pippa, dear, does

Mr. Hall know his room?

The Blue Room, Mama.

The Blue Room?

Poor man.

The one with the smoking fireplace.

Simcox.

Where'd you come from?

The old schoolroom, our study.

That's why you've been put to stay

in this dog's misery.

Come.

It's as much like college

as I could make it.

Look at the view, though.

There, you may shoot rabbits

from this window.

Oh, it is jolly for me, coming here.

Well, this place will

never seem the same again.

I shall love it at last.

Would there be anything else, sir?

No, thank you, Milly.

No, that's all.

We're up the staircase by ourselves.

We need never be in any

other part of the house,

apart from meals, that is.

I'll leave you to unpack.

See you down there.

I hope you can find enough

to amuse yourself, Mr. Hall.

So we dressed and came down

to find water lapping at

the foot of the staircase

and all the waiters wearing

green leather waders.

Yes, it was.

This house is his.

Did he tell you?

No, he didn't.

Oh, it is.

Under my late husband's will.

I must move to the dower

house as soon as he marries.

A fourth year at Cambridge

would little profit

a yokel like Clive.

He must take his place

here in the countryside.

There's the game to consider.

There are the tenants.

There'll be his duties

as a magistrate.

And unless there's a war,

there's his political future.

He ought to spend the

year traveling instead.

He must see America and,

if possible, the colonies.

He speaks of traveling.

He wants me to go with him.

I trust you

will, but not Greece, Mr. Hall.

That is traveling for pleasure.

Dissuade him from Greece.

I'd prefer America myself.

Naturally, anyone sensible would.

Pippa says he writes verse.

Have you seen any?

Mr. Hall, is there someone?

Some, Newnham girl?

Pippa declares there is.

Pippa had better ask, then.

Did I hear my name, Mr. Hall?

Hyah.

Damn, damn, it's locked.

The Goblin House.

My grandfather's grandfather built it.

I locked Pippa in here

for a whole day once

when we were small.

Ashby's

Ordinaries are up an eighth.

Three and seven-eighths,

four and three-eighths.

What's

Barclay Perkins doing?

Hmm, debit one, 87.90.

Gas staged a recovery.

What about Alliance and Dublin?

Alliance and Dublin?

Consumers' orders?

That'll do.

Up two.

Perhaps, dear Mrs. Hall,

when Clive has finally

completed, and, pray heaven,

passed his bar examinations,

would Ada not like to come down

and stay with us here at Pendersleigh?

I do declare that our sons

find amusement

in the friendship of our two families.

But Ada is such an attractive

and good-natured girl.

Although at present

Clive appears to regard

his Fridays to Mondays

entirely sacrosanct,

I'm sure that he, too,

could be enticed down.

I'm writing to Mrs. Hall.

I thought Ada might like to stay.

Ada?

Isn't that the girl whose grandfather

is going to leave her a lot of money?

She'll make an excellent

bride for my godson.

Really, perhaps Clive

doesn't want to marry yet.

Oh, would you be so good

as to post this, uh...

What's your name?

Scudder, ma'am.

We are already snug

in our little house, Mrs. Durham,

now that Maurice is living

at home after so long away.

Each day, he eats a vast breakfast

and then catches the 8:36.

He returns at 4:59,

and lays down the law.

He has developed, under

your son's influence,

into far more of a personage

than we had expected.

One hardly begrudges him the time

he spends as Clive's guest in London.

Is Clive not fortunate to

have a London house now

as well as beautiful

Pendersleigh Park?

I do confess that I am looking forward

to meeting their amusing London set,

pictures of some of whom we see

in the illustrated newspapers

here at dull Alfriston Gardens.

But I concentrated

on the tips of his mustache.

Do you think I might have

one of your cigarettes?

Do you not think

that Maurice's mustache

will be the making of him?

No, it's revolting.

Thank you, Clive.

Your cavalrymen, see,

must have legs so straight

that they can hold a sixpence between

their legs all the way up,

ankles, calves, knees, thighs.

Not only a sixpence,

is it, love?

Ends have to meet.

For the price of your beer,

no wonder.

He'll never do it.

Give the man his due.

One here.

♪ I was a pure country lad ♪

One here.

♪ Till I took the queen's shilling ♪

One here.

♪ Now it seems I've turned out bad ♪

The last sixpence there.

Oh, he's always winning.

Poor twink.

Well, I suppose it's pints

all around, gentlemen.

Get him!

Come on!

Come here, you.

Come along.

Would you give me my hat?

I'm told that if I plead guilty,

the publicity can be kept

to a minimum.

So what am I to do?

You must understand,

if I were to give you a testimonial,

it would make me a sitting

duck to any prosecution.

Yes, I see that.

I realize it might

compromise your position

to be seen to be associated with me.

Quite understand that.

Good night, Clive.

Good night.

Maurice.

Oh, where on earth have you been?

Excuse me.

Thanks.

Where have you been?

You all right?

Clive?

Yes, thank you, Maurice, I'm fine.

Please, don't nanny me.

The defendant is a man of breeding

who, rather than setting an example,

has regrettably attempted

the corruption of his social inferior.

He is a man of considerable learning

who has taken advantage

of the gullibility

and the baser passions of

his intellectual inferior.

Lord Risley, your guilt

has been unquestionably

proven before this court.

As you are no doubt aware,

I am empowered to sentence you

to imprisonment with flogging.

However, in view of the

promising career in politics,

which has been terminated

by your disgrace,

and in view of the position

in society which you have forfeited,

I am inclined to leniency,

in sentencing you

to six months imprisonment

with hard labor.

Silence!

I am satisfied that you

will pay for this

for the rest of your life.

Take him down.

All rise.

A wit, a poet.

Breeding.

Breeding, and now, legal legislator.

Legal legislator.

Clive Durham, barrister-at-art.

To Clive

Durham, our honored friend.

Barrister-at-law.

Mr. Durham.

To the

most marvelous evening.

Come on,

Clive, on your feet, Clive!

To the Durhams

of Pendersleigh Park.

Oh, I say, I'm gonna faint.

Mr. Durham!

Morrie, quickly.

Clive.

Get a pillow.

Kitty, a pillow.

Ada, brandy.

Mother.

What is it?

Fan him.

Oh, Morrie, what is it?

Oh, fan, fan, fan, fan him.

It's all right, silly to...

Oh.

Uh, all right, I'm all right.

Certainly not, Maurice

is going to carry you.

Oh, oh, dear.

Um, Mr. Durham.

Mr. Durham, try and put

your arms around Morrie.

Come along, old man, up you come.

That's it.

That's it, Morrie.

Come on.

Put your arm around me.

Sorry.

The doctor, somebody telephone.

Sorry, Morrie.

I'm a fool.

Oh, do be careful, Morrie.

It's rather hot.

Mother, you needn't tell

the others I kissed Durham.

He wouldn't like it.

No, of course not.

I was upset and, and

did it without thinking.

As you know, we're great friends.

Relations almost.

Mother, the doctor's here.

Where shall I put

the hot-water bottle?

You mustn't do this sort of thing.

You mustn't, it's filthy.

It doesn't worry me.

I don't say this just to please you.

You can carry on all night

as far as I'm concerned.

Although the doctor's coming up.

He'll see me like this.

I hope he does.

Oh, hello, Jowitt.

Sorry to call you out so late.

I'm just curious, chap.

He, uh, he fainted at dinner,

and he can't stop crying.

Been working hard?

Yes, and now he

says he's going to Greece.

So he shall.

You clear out now.

Told your sisters none of you

were to come into this room.

My sisters, yes,

I'm looking after him.

You equally.

Miss Kitty has telephoned to

the institute for a nurse.

Why is everything done

in such a damned hurry?

I thought a nurse might amuse him.

Can't we amuse him?

I can nurse him myself.

Oh, have you wheeling the baby next.

Beg your pardon?

I suppose I ought to have the nurse.

Right.

She can make you more

comfortable than I can.

Pendersleigh today?

Yes.

Mother, he can hardly stand up.

What does Jowitt say?

He seems to think

he's well enough to leave.

Keep him there.

I'll get the 1:40.

Someone will have to

talk sense to you people.

Good-bye.

What?

Shall I send the car?

No, I'll get a cab from the station.

How much do I owe?

Fourpence, governor.

Thank you.

Thank you very, very

much for being so kind.

Well, I hope you get better soon.

We've enjoyed having him

here, haven't we, Mother?

What are you playing at, Clive?

You're far too ill to travel.

I can't go on being such a

bore to your family, Maurice.

Don't be absurd.

Such good friends.

As he says, relations almost.

Mother, Mother, get in.

Good-bye, Mrs. Durham.

Thank you so much.

Good-bye, Mrs. Durham.

Don't let your coachman bump about.

Bye-bye.

Good-bye, and

don't forget his embrocation.

And fuller's earth, remember.

I'll tell cook.

Terrible affair about

Viscount Risley, sir.

And him a parliamentary

private secretary, too.

I did read he was at Cambridge.

Like yourself, sir.

You will never mention

that subject again, Simcox,

while you remain in employment here.

I've become a barrister so

that I may enter public life.

But why should I enter public life?

Who wants me?

Your mother says the country does.

Well I've talked to more

people than my mother,

and I tell you no one wants us,

or anything really,

except a comfortable home.

But to give people

a comfortable home

is what public life is for.

Is or ought to be?

Well, it's all the same.

Well, "is" and "ought"

are not the same.

Quite right, Mrs. Hall.

You sound as if you have no use

whatsoever for Greece, Mr. Hall.

It sounds out of repair.

A heap of old stones

without any paint on.

We shall know what it is

if you fall over this time,

Mr. Durham.

Your health, and the

health of all the ladies.

Maurice, come.

The ladies.

Oh, the ladies.

The ladies.

Dear Clive,

still no word from you,

so here is my news.

I am practicing a regimen

of severe self-discipline.

Our Wednesdays and our weekends

I spend in the darkest

reaches of Bermondsey

with the dockers lads at the mission.

It's a far cry from our

metropolitan pleasures.

I am supposed to be teaching

them the gentle art of boxing.

More often than not,

I get the pummeling.

Preferable to the pummeling

you gave me

at the Wigmore Hall, ha, ha.

Most of the other evenings

I spend working

through that reading

list you once gave me.

Clive, I'm so worried

at not hearing from you.

I get no sleep worrying

for fear that you've fallen ill again.

I've looked out your connections

and would expect you back

by Tuesday week.

Wire, if you can, on reaching Dover.

I don't have to tell

you how much I miss you.

Mr. Durham.

Oh, Maurice is away tonight

on business.

Oh, no, where's he gone?

Don't ask me.

We know even less about him than when

you were last here, if

you think that's possible.

He keeps everything so secret.

Mother, Ada,

Mr. Durham is back from Greece.

What was Greece like?

Um, rather disappointing,

I'm afraid.

It's not exactly what

I'd expected it would be.

Why didn't you let us know?

There'll be nothing but pie.

We would've given you

a real English dinner.

Don't worry, I can't

stay to dinner anyway--

No, Mr. Durham,

you must stop the night.

We've missed you,

haven't we, Ada, Kitty?

Maurice told us

you'd be back last week.

He was so disappointed.

We can practice on you.

We've joined an ambulance class.

We need a victim to bandage up.

It was Dr. Barry's idea.

He says there's going

to be a war soon.

You sound just like Maurice.

Your voices are wonderfully alike.

It's 'cause I have a cold.

No, you are alike, you

do have the same voice.

And nose, and by that, of course,

I mean the mouth, too.

And also his good spirits

and good health.

Kitty, on the other hand,

has his brains.

Ow, that really hurts!

Ow, ow.

Yeah, well, it's my hair.

That's very good, Kitty.

Thank you.

These are excellent,

I feel so much better.

If you knew what it was

to be in England.

Is Greece not nice?

Horrible.

Maurice said you'd like Greece.

Maurice doesn't know.

I'm happy you're back.

Maurice is home.

Clive.

Come out of all that, Clive.

Why did you let them?

I say he looks well.

You look well.

Come and have a drink.

I'll unpick you.

No, girls, not you.

Why didn't you answer my letters?

Don't you love me anymore?

All that must be tomorrow.

Quite so.

Have a drink.

Maurice, I don't want a row.

I do, I want a row,

and I'll have it.

Why didn't you write?

What secrets are you keeping from me?

I was trying to work things out,

and I couldn't explain in a letter.

One oughtn't to have

secrets, or they get worse.

One ought to talk.

No, thank you.

Talk, talk, talk.

Provided one has someone to talk to.

As you and I have.

I've thought about this solidly

for the last month and a half.

We've got to change, you and I.

Can the leopard change his spots?

Clive, you're in a muddle.

What is it you're afraid to tell me?

Surely we've got past

sparing each other.

You can't trust anyone else.

You and I are outlaws.

All this will be taken away

from us if people knew.

Precisely.

By continuing like this,

you and I are risking

everything we have.

Our careers, our,

our families, our names.

Balls!

I don't give a damn about name.

What sort of a life

would I have without you?

I risk everything, and gladly,

because the one thing

I dread losing is you.

You're the only happiness

there is for me.

There are other ways

to be happy, you know.

We could explore those a little.

Not for me.

Maurice, think how

easy life is for people

who don't have to go through all this.

This secrecy.

Never being able to talk

about the person

whom you're in love with to anybody.

Imagining the servants

are thinking things.

And always being asked

when you're gonna

get married, and having

every bloody girl

paraded in front of you

'cause your family's so desperate.

You want to

get married, is that it?

You're in love with some girl?

Who is it?

No one.

But don't you think

it would be wonderful

if there, if there was someone

who I could care about in the same way

that I do about you?

We love each other, and know it.

For God's sake, Maurice,

hold your tongue for a moment.

If I were in love with anyone now,

then it would be with some nice girl.

Like Ada.

Ada?

I take her

at random as an example.

You scarcely know Ada.

Don't be so stupid.

Try to understand.

We must change.

I like you enormously.

More, more than any man I've ever met.

Did you say something to

Ada just before I came in?

Didn't you hear my car come up?

Why did Kitty and my mother

come out and,

and not you and Ada?

Look, I really can't be

cross-examined about your sister.

Why not?

You must shut up and

concentrate, Maurice.

Ada.

What for?

Ada.

Maurice, no,

it mustn't end in a row.

Ada, Ada.

No, you can't drag in

a woman, I won't have it.

Give me the key!

Leave it!

Maurice, don't make it worse.

I didn't mean to.

Did I hurt you?

I'm all right.

What an ending.

What an ending!

Maurice?

What's gonna happen to me?

I'm done for.

Maurice?

Clive, what's the matter?

Ada.

Nothing, it's fine.

What's happened to your lip?

It's perfectly all right.

Just fooling about.

Maurice?

Don't be an ass.

Yes, he's, he's fine.

What's the matter with you?

Nothing.

Yes, there is, I can see it.

You can't take me in.

No, really, Maurice.

It's, it's nothing.

Why,

what did he say?

Nothing.

Who said nothing?

Clive, he said nothing.

Clive, is it?

What is Mr. Durham to you?

Answer.

Do you want to know what

he told me just now,

when I accused him

of making love to you

behind all our backs?

What?

When I hit him?

No, Maurice.

He said that you, he said

you threw yourself at him.

No.

That you, you tried to corrupt him.

He complained that you,

you made advances to him.

And that, that's why he wouldn't stay.

That's why he's gone back to town.

You, you have the satisfaction of

breaking up our friendship at least.

You've always been unkind to us.

Always.

It's, it's not my fault.

It isn't.

Stop, remember, step back.

That's it.

That's good of you, sir.

There ain't many city gents

that'd give up their Saturdays.

Good night, sir.

Oh, good night, Mr. Hall, sir.

Children, Clive Durham

is engaged to be married.

How friendly of his mother to tell me.

Who is she?

Lady Anne Woods.

You can read it for yourself later.

He met her in Greece.

"Lady Anne Woods,

daughter of Sir H. Woods."

Oh, Mother, you got it wrong.

What Mrs. Durham wrote is

"I will now tell you the name

of the lady,

"Anne Woods,

daughter of Sir H. Woods."

Do you know her, Maurice?

Oh, yes.

Mr. Chapman, Miss Hall.

Thank you.

Ada.

Ada, I behaved badly to you

after Clive's last visit.

He, he never said those things

I let you think he said.

He never blamed you.

I don't care whether he did.

It doesn't signify, I love Arthur now.

Chapman's a good fellow.

For two people in love, to

marry strikes me as very jolly.

I wish you happiness.

Hello.

Mr. Hall, please.

Hall, Hall, for you.

Argentine Northern Land,

gone up again.

Hmm, up six.

Hello.

Hello, Maurice.

You'll have heard my news.

Yes, but you didn't write,

so I didn't.

Quite so.

Well, the wedding's next month.

You'll be an usher?

Best of luck.

Anne's with me.

She wants to talk, too.

I'm Anne Woods.

My name's Hall.

Maurice Christopher Hall.

Mine's Anne Clare Wilbraham Woods.

But I can't think of anything to say.

You're the eighth friend of Clive's

I've spoken to this morning like this.

Eighth?

Yes, the eighth.

I'll give Clive a turn, good-bye.

Maurice,

Anne has a hundred pounds

in her pocket, would

you invest it for her?

Certainly, what sort of thing?

Whatever you fancy.

I'm not supposed to fancy

more than four percent.

Barclay Perkins.

Brewing and distillers.

They're at five percent.

Or there's Argentine Northern Land.

They've gone up a sixth,

land investments.

How about--

I like the last one best.

Very well.

Send the check here, would you?

Can't you come

down to Pendersleigh next week?

It's short notice, I know,

but later everything's

gonna be chaotic.

I'm afraid I can't do that

very well.

Hill's getting married, too.

Things are more or less busy here.

And after that,

Chapman's marrying Ada.

Well, uh, come in September.

Not October, because that's almost

certainly the by-election.

But come in September

and see us through

that awful Park versus

Village cricket match.

All right.

You'd better write nearer the time.

All right.

Goodbye, then, Maurice.

Goodbye.

Goodbye.

I mean, I haven't even

got a consulting room.

It's an illness too

awfully intimate for Jowitt.

You're the only doctor alive

I dare tell.

A secret trouble, eh?

Yeah, right, well, excuse me, my dear.

Won't be a moment.

Come along, then.

Now, now, now take your time.

And remember, of course,

that this is professional.

Nothing you say will ever

reach your mother's ears.

It's about women.

Well, we'll soon

fix that up.

Fix me, for God's sake.

I'm done for.

Now don't be afraid of me.

Now, when did you catch

the beastly thing?

It's nothing as filthy as that.

In my own wrong way

I've kept myself clean.

Oh, well, um, let's have a look.

Is that

you in there, Dr. Barry?

It's all right, Ettie.

I'm in here.

You're all right.

What do you mean, sir,

by "all right"?

Well, what I say.

You're a clean man.

Nothing wrong with you down there.

You could marry tomorrow if you like.

If you'll take an old

man's advice, you will.

So cover up now.

It's so, so drafty.

What put all this

into your head?

You've never guessed.

I'm like Lord Risley.

I'm an unspeakable.

The Oscar Wilde sort.

Rubbish, rubbish.

Dr. Barry, I can't have explained.

Now listen to me, Maurice.

Never let that evil hallucination,

that temptation from the

devil, occur to you again.

I mean, who put that lie

into your head?

You, whom I see and know

to be a decent fellow.

Dr. Barry, I want--

No, sir, I'll not discuss!

The worst thing I could

do for you is to discuss.

It's not rubbish to me.

Rubbish!

I've been like this

ever since I can remember,

without knowing why.

Am I diseased?

If I am, I want to be cured.

Find yourself a pretty young woman.

She'll soon cure you.

It's unspeakable.

Come, dress yourself.

Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

Of course.

Ettie, whiskey.

Mine.

Sir.

Bull's-eye, one less bunny wunny

for Durham to lose sleep over.

What?

Oh, buck up, man.

Corpore sano.

Look out, mine!

Damn!

Will you gentlemen wish

to continue shooting?

The mist's coming down.

I suppose he thinks it's our fault.

Very well, Scudder.

We may as well pack it in.

You'll bring the game

book up to the house.

Oh, cheer up, old man.

What has got into you?

Would you believe it's my birthday?

Good Lord, is it really?

I say, old man, many happy returns.

Durham never mentioned it at all.

Durham's far too busy canvassing.

Come on.

Let's toast it in chiskey.

That's more like it.

Telegram arrived for you

at midday, sir.

Oh, thank you, Simcox.

There, you see?

Durham did remember your birthday.

Shall we have that drink?

Mm, two large chiskeys, Simcox.

Very good, sir.

I think I may have to go

to town with you tomorrow.

Hall, old fellow, what a pity.

You might have had more shooting.

Nothing wrong, is there?

No, have business.

Happy birthday, sir.

Hello, did you have

a good day shooting?

Frightful.

It's awfully rude of Clive

to have been here so little,

but he's working so hard.

And I do think it'll be a good idea

for the poor

if he does get in, don't you?

He's their best friend,

if only they knew it.

You can't worry too much

about the poor.

One must give them a leg up,

for the sake of the country,

but they don't suffer as

we should in their place.

I see we're in the hands of

the right sort of stockbroker.

Oh, here's the Reverend Borenius.

He's joining us for

dinner, do you know him?

He's come to scold Clive

about the tenants' housing.

Now, he would say that they want love.

No doubt they do,

but they won't get it.

Mr. Hall.

I scold Clive for being cynical,

but really, I think

you're being horrible.

I get used to being horrible.

The poor get used to their slums.

After you've banged about a bit,

you get used to your particular hole.

Everyone yaps at first.

I've had a telegram.

I've got to go back up

to town tomorrow.

Oh, no,

not bad news I hope.

No.

Well, in that case, it

must be an amorous intrigue.

Maurice has to go back

to London tomorrow.

What?

Well, that's what he told me.

But damn it,

he's only just arrived.

He had a telegram.

He's being awfully secretive.

He's being impossible.

What about the cricket?

I rather like him.

I have a private notion he's in love.

I think he has a little girl

up in London.

Your hand, Pippa.

Darling--

It's all right, Archie, I'll manage.

Mr. Borenius, your turn.

Oh, forgive me.

The family ghost again.

There's

the sweetest little hole

in the ceiling, Clive,

can't we leave it?

Well, we shall have to,

but let's move the pianoforte

because I don't think

it's going to stand much more.

How about a saucer?

Clive, how about a saucer?

Once the rain came through

the ceiling of the club.

I rang the bell and the

servant brought a saucer.

I ring the bell and the

servant brings me nothing.

Hmm.

I knew this beastly

present would come in useful.

Poor Pendersleigh.

Milly, bring a basin

will you, and a duster,

and get one of the men

to help shift the piano.

The rain's come through again.

We had to ring twice, twice.

It's got right

under the sounding board,

I'm afraid.

Can't

make it sound any worse

than it already does.

Shall I

place this lamp here?

Ah, Scudder.

Shift the piano, would you,

and, um, take up the carpet.

Tomorrow you'd better go up

and attack that roof again.

Well, there we are, everybody.

Perhaps we'd better turn

in, leave them to it.

Before we get carried

away on the flood tide.

Pippa, tell Simcox to bring

up my nightcap, will you?

The cellar will be awash by now.

Why is my house falling down?

Anne.

Maurice, are you coming up?

A saucer

would have done the job.

How very kind of you.

Down, down there a bit.

Little bit more.

More, bit more.

Down, down.

Someone will have to get up

in the night, change the bowl.

As soon as

my body developed,

the obscene imaginings began.

I thought that some individual

curse had descended on me.

My schooling was pure enough.

A terrific scandal there

before my arrival

meant that we were drilled all day,

and policed all night.

I had little chance, therefore,

to talk about such experiences

with my school fellows.

I am the only son in my fam--

Oh, Maurice,

I am glad.

Well, it's the greatest thing

on earth.

Perhaps the only one.

Anne guessed as much.

Aren't women extraordinary?

Oh, Maurice, it's what

I've always wished for you.

I know you have.

You don't mind if I tell her?

Only Anne, of course.

Not a bit, tell everyone.

You don't mind?

No.

I just wanted to show that,

I hadn't forgotten the past.

But I agree.

Let's not mention it again.

All right.

Aren't you glad

it's all ended properly?

How properly?

Well, instead of that

muddle last year.

With you.

Quits, and I'll go.

Come back here as soon

as you can, won't you?

Clive?

I've been talking to Maurice.

You were right.

Told you he had something

up his sleeve.

Make sure the

tarpaulin covers the cover.

Pull it down.

I think he's after a tip.

Tell him to boil his head.

I offered him five shillings,

but he wouldn't take it, damn cheek.

Best of luck.

I'm so glad you're not

really horrible.

Are you?

Good-bye, dear Maurice.

Good-bye.

You gave him more, I suppose.

Five shillings not good enough?

You'll only take gold?

I'll take it.

Clive.

You're coming back very soon.

Good luck.

Thanks, old man.

Cheerio, old man.

Archie, good-bye.

Good-bye.

Thank you, Simcox.

Good-bye.

Bye, Maurice.

Good-Bye.

See you soon.

Bye, Maurice.

Good-Bye.

I do wish I knew the girl's name.

You're not quite off yet, I think.

No, I'm not.

I'm nearer off now.

Hmm.

How do you like my consulting room?

It's a nice room.

Not too dark.

Rather dark.

You can see the picture

on the wall ahead of you?

Come nearer, Mr. Hall.

Take care of that crack

in the carpet, though.

How broad is the crack?

You can jump it.

Admirable.

Now, what do you suppose

this picture is of?

Whom is it of?

It is, Miss Edna May.

I want to go home to my mother.

Miss Edna May is beautiful.

She is attractive.

She's not attractive to me.

What an ungallant remark.

Oh...

Mr. Hall.

Look at her lovely hair.

I like short hair best.

Why?

Because...

Because...

Did it get anywhere near?

You're open to suggestion.

I made you see a picture

on the bare wall.

I'd, I'd like another appointment.

Telephone me in two weeks.

In the meantime, uh, take

exercise in moderation.

A little tennis,

stroll around with a gun.

Go back to the country.

It, it seems rather foolish

to make that journey twice in one day.

Hey old fellow.

Good Lord, you did rush

back, what a shame.

We're just off

electioneering overnight.

I'm sorry, I, I had no idea.

But I understood distinctly from you

that all your servants

had been confirmed.

I thought so.

I did think so, Mr. Borenius.

The trouble is, Mrs. Durham,

that even if the bishop

can be prevailed upon,

I have not time to prepare

him before he sails.

Mr. Hall.

Ah, Mr. Hall.

Simcox informed us

that you'd returned.

You're in time for dinner.

Did you have a successful trip?

That remains to be seen.

Dinner jacket's enough tonight.

I'm afraid we're only three.

Pardon me, sir.

Um, will the gentleman

be shooting tomorrow?

I don't think so.

Obviously not, it's the cricket match.

I'm sure, sir,

I'm very sorry if I failed

to give you and Mr. London

full satisfaction, sir.

That's all right, Scudder.

Glad to see you

down again so soon, sir.

That's all right, Scudder.

The way that Scudder

sprang his notice on Clive.

His brother has found him

a job in the Argentine.

His brother has got him

the fare, so off he goes.

Excuse me, sir.

The underkeeper wonders

whether you have orders.

I saw him before dinner, Simcox.

Nothing, thanks.

Tomorrow's the match.

I did tell him.

He wonders whether

the gentleman wished

to bathe between innings, sir.

He's just bailed out the boat.

If that's Scudder, will

you tell him I'll come

and speak to him directly?

Very good, sir.

Good night, sir.

Oh, Scudder.

Good night.

They tell me you're emigrating.

That's my idea, sir.

Well, good luck to you.

Thank you, sir.

Seems rather strange.

The Argentine, I understand.

That's right, sir.

Have you ever

visited it yourself, sir?

No.

No, England for me.

Night, sir.

Good night.

I'm off, then.

An easy start tomorrow.

Only Mr. Hall's pleasure to wait upon.

Mr. Hall's a gentleman.

Was that you calling to me, sir?

I know, sir.

It's all right, I know, sir.

Come on,

lie down.

Sir, the church has struck.

You'll have to release me.

Maurice.

Maurice.

There's the cricket

pitch I have to help roll

for the match,

and the young birds, too.

The boat's done.

Mr. London dived splack

into the water lilies.

They told me that all young

gentlemen learn to dive.

Well, I never learned to.

It seems more natural-like

not to let your head

get under the water.

I call that drowning before your day.

I was taught I'd be ill

if I didn't get my hair wet.

Well, you was taught

what wasn't the case.

Alec,

did you ever dream you had a friend,

someone to last your whole life?

Nice day, sir.

Nice day for the match.

Ah, he moved that ladder

away at last, I see.

About time.

Now, sir...

what will you wear, I wonder?

Will you put your cricketing

flannels on straightaway?

All right.

Oh, sir, in, uh,

Mr. Durham's absence,

the servants feel

we should be so honored

if you would captain us for the match.

I'm no cricketer, Simcox.

Who's your best bat?

We have none better than

the under gamekeeper, sir.

Scudder, sir.

Well, then make Scudder captain.

Pity, sir.

Things always go better

with a gentleman captain.

Tell him to put me to field deep.

And I won't bat first.

Bat eighth if he likes.

You might tell him, as I

shan't be down till it's time.

Very good, sir.

Oh, dear, sir.

Mud on the carpet.

I'll send someone up.

Very good, sir.

The captain's put

himself in to bat first.

Clive Durham would never

ave done that.

Little points

interest me.

He's our best man, apparently.

I've an instinct

the man's conceited.

He's lasted very well.

He's playing more carefully this year.

Run!

Run hard, Roger!

Throw it

to the bowler's end.

They're going two.

That's me.

Man in.

Go for it.

Jolly well done!

Marvelous!

Well done.

After it, Graham!

Chase hard.

Get it in hard.

Quick, they're going three,

they're going three, chase hard.

I do begin to see what you mean.

Well, with a haircut.

Go chase it, boy.

Wonderful!

Keep it up.

Jolly well done, Hall!

Bravo, bravo, well done.

Scudder's holding the fort for you.

He's doing rather well.

Well, I suppose I'd

better play for a bit,

please these people.

Over.

Simon.

Andrew, down to point.

Clive.

Maurice.

Aren't you exhausted?

Well, I've had

meetings till midnight.

I've got another this afternoon.

But I'm back tonight, and then

your visit really does begin.

Now, gentlemen.

We stand rebuked.

To the Olympic Games, Maurice.

Yes.

Take him, Simon!

No, wait, sorry, Maurice, sorry.

Get it in, Andy.!

Sorry.

Well played, Mr. Hall.

Thank you.

Ah, thank you, Simcox.

I know, sir.

It's all right.

I know, sir.

Come on.

What sort of man was that keeper

of yours who captained us?

Scudder?

Well, he's a little bit smart,

but Anne would say I'm being unfair.

You can't expect our standard

of honesty in servants.

What sort of background did he have?

Let's see, um, wasn't his

father the butcher at Osmington?

Yes, I think so.

Is your head feeling rotten again?

Putrid.

I do wish you'd think of

Pendersleigh as your second home.

Just treat it like an hotel.

Come and go when you like.

Doesn't matter if I'm home or not.

Anne feels as I do.

Pretend to the other gentlemen

that you want a stroll.

It's easily managed.

Then come down to the boathouse.

Dear sir, let me share with you once

before leaving old England.

It's not asking too much.

You should not resist me.

You're resisting me.

Damn it, I'm not.

You're less suggestible

than you were.

Don't give up.

I do not propose

to give up, Mr. Hall.

Have I fallen short of your 50%?

I needn't remind you that your sort

were once put to death in England.

I would advise you to

live in some country,

France, Italy, where homosexuality

is no longer criminal.

Will it ever be like that

in England?

England has always been disinclined

to accept human nature.

I have not told you the whole truth.

No, Mr. Hall?

Since I was here, I

went wrong, with the gamekeeper.

I'm terrified he may blackmail me.

Apparently, he's quite

smart enough to do so.

I have an idea

that's what's stopping me

from going into a trance.

He sent me a letter, you see.

Read it.

"Come to the boathouse.

"I have key and will let you in."

No doubt he has a duplicate key,

and an accomplice

waiting up at the house.

"I, since cricket

match, do long to place

"both arms around you

and share with you.

"The above now seems

sweeter than words can say.

"Mind and write if you don't come,

"for I get no sleep waiting.

"So come without fail to boathouse,

"Pendersleigh, tomorrow night.

"Yours respectfully, Alec Scudder,

"Gamekeeper to...

"C. Durham, Esquire."

I'm walking on a volcano.

He's an uneducated man, but

he's got me in his power.

Will he have a case in

court, do you think?

I'm no lawyer, Mr. Hall.

You'd have to consult your solicitor.

My children playing overhead.

How did a country lad

like that know?

Why did he come to me that one night

when I was at my weakest?

There we are, sir.

Just a moment.

Uh, ticket, please, ticket.

Maurice.

What, uh, what brings

you to London, Scudder?

My, um, brother and I

have, um, some business here.

You ought to know what it is.

I'll be with you in a few minutes.

Let me just have a word

with Scudder here.

Something's up at the mission.

Scudder, is it?

"Alec, you're a dear fellow,"

you said.

You did.

What mission?

What, you ashamed to be seen with me?

Hmm, you're not glad anyway.

Don't say you are.

Of course I'm glad.

Then why didn't you

come to the boathouse?

I waited two nights.

I got no sleep waiting.

Shh!

I know something.

I'm sure you do.

I'm sure you could tell me

a good many things, Alec.

I know about you and Mr. Durham.

This is your office, is it?

What do you do here?

You shouldn't treat me like a dog.

You was just amusing yourself.

I've never come like that

to a gentleman before.

You said, "Call me Maurice,"

but you never even wrote to me.

You made a fool of me, and

I can make you sorry for it.

He's big enough, isn't he?

Well, they must've owned

wonderful machinery

to make a thing like that.

I expect so.

Mine's got five legs.

So has mine.

It's a peculiar notion,

when you think about it.

It won't do, Mr. Hall.

I know what you're trying to do.

You'd do better to settle

this, I can tell you.

You've had your fun.

Now you've gotta pay up.

I'll leave you to think it over.

Surely, surely you're an old

boy at Mr. Abrahams's school.

Now, now, don't,

don't tell me your name.

I, I, I want to remember.

I shall remember.

Um, you're not Colgan.

You're not Smith, I know.

You're, you're Wimbleby, yes?

My name's Scudder.

Isn't, I'm Mr. Scudder.

And I've got a serious charge

to bring against this gentleman.

Yes, awfully serious.

My goodness me.

I am really most,

most frightfully sorry.

I, I, I do beg your pardon.

It's seldom I make a mistake.

Well, remarkable place,

this, isn't it?

Not just a collection of relics.

It's a place which could

stimulate the minds of the--

Less fortunate?

Well, quite so.

To ask questions which one,

which one no doubt

inadequately tries to--

Ben, we're waiting.

Oh uh, yes, quite so.

I, uh, I, I, excuse me.

Extraordinary thing.

I shan't trouble you any further.

Where are you going

with your serious charge?

I don't know what came over me.

You blackmailed me.

No, sir, no

You didn't?

Maurice, listen.

Maurice am I?

Well, you called me Alec.

I'm as good as you.

I don't find you are.

By God, if you'd split on me to Ducie,

I'd have broken you.

Might have cost me

hundreds, but I've got them.

But the police always back

my sort against yours.

As good as I?

Come outside.

It rained even harder

than this at the boathouse.

It was even colder.

Why did you not come?

I was frightened.

And you let yourself get afraid of me.

That's why we're trying

to down each other.

I wouldn't take a penny from you.

I don't want to hurt

your little finger.

Come on.

Let's give over talking, here.

Stop with me.

Sleep the night with me.

I, I can't.

I've got an engagement.

A formal business dinner.

It's my job.

Meet me another evening instead.

I can't come to London again.

My father or Mr. Borenius

will be passing remarks.

What does it matter if they do?

What does your engagement matter?

First time I seed you, I thought,

"I wish I had that one."

And it is so.

The only good thing to

happen to me at Pendersleigh.

"Scudder, do this.

"Scudder, do that."

The old lady, she says,

"Oh, would you most kindly

"of your goodness post this for me.

"What's your name?

"What's your name?"

Every day for bloody 18 months

I went to that front porch for orders

and the old bitch doesn't

even know my name.

I said to her, "What's your name?

"Fuck your name!"

Nearly did, too.

Wish I had.

And you, too grand to

come to the boathouse.

"Haw, my man.

"Five shillings not good

enough for you, eh?"

You've no idea how you

nearly missed gettin' me.

Boathouse was the place

I always fancied.

I still got the key now,

matter of fact.

We'll meet in your boathouse yet.

No, we won't.

You'll remember that at any rate.

Tomorrow's Thursday.

Friday's packing.

Saturday, Southampton, so

it's good-bye, old England.

You mean that you and I

shan't meet again after now?

That's right.

You got it quite correct.

Stay with me.

Stay, miss my boat?

You daft?

Of all the bloody rubbish.

Order me about again, you would.

It's a chance in a thousand we met.

You know it.

Why don't you stay?

Stay, with you?

How, and where?

With your ma?

Oh, yeah.

What would she say if she saw me?

All rough and ugly the way I am.

My people wouldn't take

to you one bit.

And I don't blame them either.

And how would you run your job,

I'd like to know?

I shall chuck it.

Your job in the city, what

gives you money and position?

You talk like a man who's

never had to earn his living.

You can do anything,

once you know what it is.

We can live without money,

without people.

We can live without position.

We're not fools.

We're both strong.

There'll be someplace we could go.

Wouldn't work, Maurice.

Be the ruin of us both.

Can't you see?

Well, I'm off.

Pity we ever met, really,

if you think about it.

You paid for this room

in advance, didn't you?

I mean, they won't stop

me downstairs or anything?

You'll be all right.

Edgar, I shan't be long.

Just wait for me.

Yes, sir.

Good afternoon.

Oh, yes, um, I've come

to see a passenger off.

Alec Scudder.

Ah, the Scudders.

Yes, I believe they're up there, sir.

Right, thank you.

Thank you very much, sir.

Plenty of time yet.

Oh, he won't be late.

If Alec says a thing, he means it.

He can be late if he likes.

I can manage without him,

but he needn't expect

me to help him anymore.

Mr. Scudder?

You must be Alec Scudder's brother.

I've come to see him off.

Alec ain't aboard yet,

but his kit is.

Interested to see his kit?

No, no, no, don't worry.

I'll just wait with you, if I may.

My name's Maurice Hall.

Good afternoon, Mr. Hall.

Now, this is kind of you, Mr. Hall.

I could hardly believe my eyes

when I saw you among his friends here.

Family, my parents.

And I'm his brother,

Frederick Scudder,

purveyor of viand, at your service.

Ah, I am Mr. Borenius.

Alec is one of my parishioners.

I've come to give him a

letter of introduction

to an Anglican priest in Buenos Aires,

in the hopes that he will

be confirmed after landing.

Very kind of you, sir, I'm sure.

How did you know so

precisely when the boat sailed?

It was advertised.

All aboard now.

May I speak frankly to you?

I'm far from easy about Scudder.

The fact is, he has been

guilty of sensuality

with women.

It's not just the deed of fornication.

When the nations went a-whoring,

they invariably ended up

by denying God.

Until all sexual irregularities,

and not some of them, are penal,

the church will never

again reconquer England.

I have reason to believe,

Scudder spent Tuesday night in London,

fornicating.

I'm telling you all this

because of your charitable

interest in him.

But surely he wouldn't

have missed his train.

Well, they wouldn't leave without him.

He's bloody well missed

his bleeding train!

Gentlemen!

Gentlemen.

Gentlemen, I do assure you,

Mr. Scudder was booked for a passage.

But his kit's aboard.

His kit's aboard.

Clive.

Don't tell Anne I'm here.

I've only a few minutes.

I mean, look here,

man, that's fantastic.

She'll be furious if you

don't stay the night.

Maurice, I hope nothing's wrong.

Pretty well everything.

You'd think so.

Very well, I'm at your service.

My advice, though, is

to sleep here tonight

and ask Anne in the morning.

Where a woman is in question,

it's always better to ask

another woman,

and particularly if she has

Anne's almost uncanny insight.

I'm not here to see Anne.

Or you, Clive.

It's miles worse for you.

I'm in love with Alec Scudder.

What a grotesque announcement.

Most grotesque.

But I felt I ought to tell you.

Maurice,

Maurice, we did everything we could

when you and I

thrashed out the subject.

When you brought

yourself to kiss my hand.

Don't allude to that.

Come in here.

I'm more sorry for you

than I can possibly say.

And I do, do beg you to resist

the return of this obsession.

I don't need advice.

I'm flesh and blood, Clive,

if you'll condescend

to such low things.

I've shared with Alec.

Shared, shared what?

Everything.

Alec slept with me in the Russet Room,

when you and Anne were away.

Oh, good God.

Also in town.

The sole excuse for

any relationship between

two men is that it remain

purely platonic.

Surely we agreed that.

I don't know.

I've come to tell you what I did.

Well, Alec, Scudder,

is in point of fact

no longer in my service.

In fact, he's no longer in England.

He sailed for Buenos Aires

this very day.

He didn't.

He sacrificed his career for

my sake, without a guarantee.

I don't know whether that's

platonic of him or not,

but it's what he did.

Scudder missed his boat?

Maurice, you're going mad.

May I ask if you intend to pursue--

No, no, you may not ask.

I'll tell you everything

up to this minute.

Not a word beyond.

Alec?

Alec.

So you got the wire, then?

What wire?

The wire I sent to your house,

telling you...

Oh, sorry.

I'm a bit tired, what with

one thing and another.

No, telling you to come here,

to the boathouse at

Pendersleigh without fail.

Now we shan't never be parted.

It's finished.

Will that be all, sir?

Yes, thank you, Simcox.

Good night, sir.

Good night.

Come on!

Who were you talking to?

No one, no one.

I was just trying out a speech.

(in Greek) Yes.

(woman) How are you?

- Good.

- It's been a while.

Your grandmother? Better?

Worse.

She's lucky to have you.

Your father would have been proud

that you are taking care of her.

Look...

I wanted to ask you,

what time will you be home tomorrow?

In the afternoon, after work. Why?

I have sent you something small.

It's different from the others.

We'll talk tomorrow. Good night.

Good night.

(man's voice on radio)

100, 200, 300, 400, 20...

And two euros.

This is the last of it.

I'll get in touch with you

if I need you again.

(groans)

(woman) I didn't want to send

a German book again

but something to get familiar

with the area here.

I've written our address

on the first page.

She left us this morning.

Will you come?

I would have come for sure...

But I am alone with Patrick these days.

It's difficult for me to leave.

I can't leave him with Helga.

I don't trust her.

It's also his birthday this Sunday

and I have to organise a party.

I wish I could be there.

(man)

We offer a very economical package.

1050 euros for the entire ceremony.

We provide the hearse

and two people to transport the coffin.

We need two more.

One more person besides you.

The price doesn't include

the workers who dig the grave.

With the digging of the grave,

the price will be 1200 euros.

Shall I presume

that a family grave already exists?

Then we have coffee, rusk, and brandy.

Two euros per person.

If we expect around fifty people,

then the price will be 1500 euros.

Unless the deceased was popular. Hmm?

Was she popular?

Excuse me! You cannot sleep here!

It's ham and cheese.

Take it. You deserve it.

No.

You stole it.

(man) OK.

Travelling alone?

Are you Italian?

Not Italian.

You're Greek then.

Chances are almost 50-50.

The ship goes from Greece to Italy.

You?

I'm German.

(in German) I'm from Germany.

Good day.

(in English) You don't look German.

You don't look Greek.

I come to Greece every summer.

This time I went to Kefalonia.

What about you?

How was your summer?

Fantastic.

So where are you going?

North.

You have a car?

No.

(in Italian) Ladies and gentlemen,

welcome to the port of Bari.

(in English) I thought you said

you don't have a car.

I knew you did.

I saw you yesterday in the garage.

But it's fine,

you don't have to feel bad about it.

I don't feel bad.

You want to be alone in the car.

I completely understand.

You do know how to get

out of town, right?

You see there?

That's the Molo Sud.

You go right, you pass the Lazaretto

and at the roundabout,

you take the second exit to the right,

via Eugene Luigi.

And at the next roundabout,

you take the third exit.

I've done it a hundred times by car

and it's amazing.

Especially if you know

which routes to take.

Alright then.

Safe trip.

I can drive you up until one point.

I'm going north.

I'm twenty-six years old.

"Hello, my name is Ursula."

- Ursula Handtmann.

- "Ursula Handtmann."

I'm twenty-six years old.

I live in Munich. Bavaria is...

(in English)

I can teach you some German.

(in German) Are you hungry?

You have money?

(in English) You can tell so much

by how long it takes someone to order.

And by what he's having.

Mainly by what he's having.

- What am I having?

- That's easy.

A club sandwich.

You can't go wrong

with a club sandwich, right?

And I'm sure you never get pickles or

mustard to the side to spice things up.

- (in German) You're a fast-food kid.

- (in English) What?

You don't eat pickles, do you?

Pickles? I eat. Sometimes.

- (waiter, in Italian) Good morning.

- Good morning.

(waiter) What can I bring you?

(in English) I'll choose for you.

- (in Italian) Number 12 for me.

- (waiter) Number 12.

- And 54 for my friend.

- (waiter) Fifty-four.

- Thank you.

- You're welcome.

(in English)

What did you order? I'm very hungry.

- Angry?

- Hungry.

(in Italian) Sorry. ..

And a saucer with pickles, please.

- (waiter) Of course.

- Thanks.

(in English) What did you order?

I don't know,

I just said random numbers.

Tell me, what numbers did you order?

- Come on, don't spoil the surprise.

- Tell me the numbers.

If you don't like it, I'll pay.

You know, you can't steal

food from here.

I only steal food from places

that are irrationally expensive.

Oh.

Five euros for an awful sandwich

and it tasted like shit.

So in this case,

who is really the thief?

You.

So what's the reason for your trip?

No reason.

I'm going for a ride.

You are doing this entire trip

just for a ride?

(scoffs) No way.

Why are you going by car

and not by plane?

Why aren't you going by plane?

I'm going for a ride.

I got money in my pocket and

a month to spend before work starts.

What work?

I'm teaching snowboard and ski

at the Bavarian Alps.

It's fun.

(in Italian) Number 12.

Thank you.

Number 54.

(in English) You pay.

(in Italian) Have a nice meal.

Thank you.

(in English) Pickles?

(song on radio)

Take the next exit

and get off the autostrada.

No, I don't want

to get off the autostrada.

- We've lost a lot of time.

- Why?

Is someone waiting for you?

Since we're doing this trip,

I don't understand

why you don't want to enjoy it.

(Victoras) Maybe I'm in danger.

- You're in danger?

- Yeah.

The way you drive,

if someone is in danger, it's me.

I have put a stranger in my car.

How do I know

you're not a serial killer?

How do I know you're not going

to cut me into pieces?

Maybe that's why you insist

to get off the autostrada.

I don't see any reason

to cut you into pieces.

What if I just killed you?

Let's try the provincial road

for a while.

If you don't like my route,

we will go back to the autostrada.

Let's go.

I know these routes very well.

Trust me.

(Mathias) Let's play a game.

You know the game 20 questions?

(Victoras) No.

What? Everybody knows it.

Well, you put something in your mind

and I have 20 questions

to guess what it is.

I'll ask you questions,

and you answer with a yes or a no.

(Victoras)

How will I learn things about you?

(Mathias) You can better judge a man

by his questions

than by his answers.

(Victoras) Where do you read all this?

Oh! I was always wondering

who buys all those stupid books.

You can start

your questions if you want.

Go ahead.

- OK, I'll start.

- OK.

First question.

Have you lived

your whole life in Greece?

- Come on.

- Yes.

Second question. Do you have a job?

No.

Did you study anything?

I... started studying agriculture...

(Mathias) Agriculture?

I could never imagine that.

(Victoras)

But I didn't really finish that.

(Mathias) I need to pee.

(Victoras) What, here?

Not here. Keep driving down that road.

Why? Why drive down that road?

The time has come

to cut you into pieces.

- (Mathias) It's fine.

- (Victoras) Wait, wait, wait.

Wait!

(Mathias) Since you're studying

agriculture or whatever,

you can name all these trees here

with their scientific names

while I'm peeing.

(Victoras) You said you wanted to pee.

(Mathias) I am.

Would you have stopped

if I told you I also wanted to swim?

(Victoras) No.

What are you waiting for? Get in.

(Victoras) Oh, no.

Why? Can't you swim?

(Victoras) I am not getting in a lake

that you have pissed in.

Have you ever swum in a lake?

(Victoras) No.

Come on, get in.

For the experience.

I'll save you if you drown. Promise.

Good boy.

Should I tell you how to jump?

Slightly bend the knees

and then throw your weight forward.

And push with the legs.

Otherwise you will fall on your belly.

(Mathias) I'm an excellent teacher.

- It's nice, huh?

- (Victoras) Yeah. Nice.

(Mathias) So where did you learn this?

(Victoras) I'm not gonna tell you that.

- You were improvising?

- Yeah.

What a talent.

Ladies and gentlemen,

we found the best talent of Greece.

(Mathias) I told you this route was nicer.

You need to start trusting

the stranger in your car.

(Victoras laughs)

So, where were we?

Right!

Are you going to Germany?

- Did you search my stuff?

- So that's a yes.

No.

Yes.

Maybe.

Maybe?

This game is stupid.

You can't answer everything

with a yes or no.

- Yes.

- No.

I guess the world has become

too complex for simple answers.

(car horn)

(in Italian) Fuck you, asshole!

Stronzo in your face, asshole!

(in English) I really can't tell

who drives the worst,

Greeks or Italians.

I don't think it's a good idea

to go so fast here.

Why? Am I getting outside

my comfort zone?

Ohh!

Ohh!

Ohh!

(police siren)

(voice on police radio)

- (in Italian) Hello.

- Hello.

You know you were driving

over the limit?

(in English)

I told you not to drive so fast.

(in Italian)

Licence and registration, please.

(in English) Licence and car registration.

(in Italian) Calm down.

Who is Angeliki?

Who?

(in English) Who is Angeliki?

It's none of your business.

(in Italian) It's none of your business.

Have you been drinking?

- (Victoras) Yes.

- No.

Are you going to take our order, then?

Get out of the car.

Get out. Exit the car.

Let's go.

Come on.

(Mathias, in Italian) Thank you very much.

(in German) Thanks. Goodbye.

(in English) Lesson of the day:

people here can't take a joke.

Why did I take you with me?

Because you like me.

I don't like you.

You're so cruel.

You think it's wise to drive without

a licence in front of the police station?

It's your fault.

I wasn't driving

and you were speeding.

Fuck you.

We're just two strangers sharing a car.

My car.

Your car.

If you want,

I can be your personal driver.

- You have a licence?

- You should not know.

Where are we going?

(Mathias)

Somewhere to eat, drink and sleep.

But you must wear a shirt.

I don't think this is a good idea.

(Mathias)

You got something better to do tonight?

Is this why we got off the autostrada?

(yawns)

(Mathias) Have fun.

(music)

(cheering)

(Mathias) What makes them believe

they can spend their whole life

with the same person?

We're happy now.

Come on.

Tommaso, hi.

Mathias.

(in Italian) Hi. You came!

I brought a friend, OK?

Tommaso this is Victoras.

Victoras this is Tommaso.

- Hi, Victoras.

- Hi.

Strong handshake.

Are you German?

No.

- English?

- No.

- French?

- No.

- Bulgarian?

- No.

Ask him if he's Greek.

Greek?

- Yes.

- But of course!

(women chant)

(cheering)

(in English) Now we drink.

(in Italian) Cheers!

(in English)

Where did you and Mathias meet?

First time we met,

it was at the Greek Islands.

We had great time, the two of us.

Just the boys,

doing island hopping, drinking

and getting naked on the beach.

We then took the ferry to Italy.

And I gave him a ride in my car.

(Mathias) Did he pay for gas?

- (Mathias) Drink!

- Yes.

You don't drink?

Did I tell you?

This family makes the wine.

(Tommaso) Where did you two meet?

(Victoras) In Greece.

We did island hopping. Naked.

You are very different

from his other friends.

- Really?

- Really.

Come on, dance. Come on.

("Vita Sociale" by Canova)

(woman, in Italian) Here I am. Turn right.

Bye, beautiful.

Thanks a lot.

Bye.

You've forgotten something.

(in English) Remember her?

What happened to her?

She left her heart on the dance floor.

(in Italian) Here you go.

Your sandwich is ready.

Thanks.

Can you take me there?

What's there?

(Mathias) Is this it?

(Victoras) I won my first medal here.

Stay here.

That feeling when you're in the air

is incredible.

Your heart is pounding like crazy.

And the adrenaline

is rushing through you.

And in that one moment...

you're flying.

Light as a feather.

Until gravity pulls you down again,

just to remind you

that you can't escape.

Gravity will always

pull you down to the ground.

Who's Angeliki Lötz?

Well, who is she?

I told you, don't touch my stuff.

- (Mathias) We're not going there?

- No. I'm going home.

I made a big mistake.

Tell me where do you want me

to drop you off?

We're almost there.

Is she your girlfriend?

No, of course not, this I know.

Is she your mother?

Yes.

And you're angry with her? Yes.

Does she know that you took her car?

No.

Does she know

that you're going to see her?

(Victoras) Where do you

want me to drop you off?

You do know that you don't have

a driver's licence, right?

You should be fine.

(Mathias) Is your mother a serial killer?

Yes.

And she kills mostly children?

Yes.

And now you're going to punish her?

Yes.

What will you do? Kill her?

And then I'll chop her head off

and cut her into pieces!

Yes or no? Concentrate.

Yes!

And then set her car on fire?

Yes!

And burn down the house as well?

Yes.

(Mathias) So what is your mother doing

in Bavaria?

(Victoras) She met a German guy

in Greece six years ago.

She got pregnant

and went to stay with him.

(Mathias) Is it a brother or a sister?

(Victoras) A brother.

(Mathias)

And you didn't keep any contact?

(Victoras) In the beginning,

she was visiting.

I met my brother when he was a baby.

Now she calls me every once in a while.

Every year she sends me

a German learning book with a CD.

This year she sent

a travel guide to Bavaria.

(Mathias)

Why have you never visited them?

(Victoras)

I think your 20 questions are over.

(Mathias) Yes.

No.

Maybe.

(Mathias, in German) Are you tired?

(cockerel crows)

Breakfast?

- The one here is over.

- Hmm.

- Are you OK?

- Yeah.

Good.

These cost five euros.

Can you believe it?

Five euros for a packet of chips

just because

they're in the middle of nowhere.

Are you out of your mind?

Did you steal them?

(Mathias) No one saw me. Relax.

Are you stupid,

you stole from the gas station?

Did you pay for the gas?

Here's the receipt.

Stop shouting at me.

Chips?

- Stop polluting Mother Nature!

- Shut up!

- You're the crazy one here, man.

- Shut up!

You keep putting me in danger

and then you ask me to trust you!

How the fuck can I trust you?

You know it's my car.

You know I don't have a licence.

And you keep on behaving

like a five-year-old!

"This costs five euros,

can you believe it? Let's steal it!"

Fucking child.

- That's it.

- (indicator ticks)

Leave!

Fuck off!

(wind whistles)

(voice on police radio)

(German folk music on radio)

Um...

(in German) Hello.

Have you...

(in English) Have you seen a young man?

- Um, brown hair? Brown eyes?

- (in German) No.

Ciao.

Ciao.

So where are we going now?

(children's voices)

Are you nervous?

You wanna leave and come back later?

Let's have some fun.

(bell rings)

Is that her?

(in German) No. No. No.

Come in. Come in.

Oh, look. She has a new Audi.

(child) Hello.

(balloon pops)

(in German) I'm sorry. This is my son.

(in Greek)

Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

You are here!

I came with a friend.

Mathias, Angeliki. Angeliki, Mathias.

- Hello.

- (in German) Hello. Nice to meet you.

(in Greek)

You already made a friend here?

We came together from Greece.

(Angeliki, in German)

You came from Greece together?

(Mathias) Yes. We came with your car.

- (Angeliki) Which car?

- The Audi.

That piece of crap is still working?

But don't worry,

your son is an amazing driver.

He only got us arrested once.

(laughs) Your friend is funny.

He doesn't speak German.

(in Greek)

So much for all the books I've sent.

Are you hungry?

Should Helga make you a plate?

Helga! Helga!

Helga!

(in German)

Can you bring two plates please?

This is Victoras...

My son.

- And...

- Mathias.

- Mathias.

- Hello.

(Mathias) Hello.

(in Greek)

Did you meet this handsome fellow?

This is our Bjarke.

Amazing breed.

Obedient.

And very expensive!

Patrick... Where is Patrick?

You have to see your brother.

You won't recognise him!

If I'd known you were coming,

we would have celebrated differently.

(in German) Where is my cake?

(in Greek)

Look how much your brother grew up.

(in German)

Patrick, you remember Victoras?

- No!

- You met him in Greece!

How could he remember you?

Helga, let's get the sweets now!

For the kids!

Be careful, Patrick!

(Angeliki, in Greek)

Come outside and meet the others.

Too bad Sasha is not here!

Patrick! Come!

(in English) Nice cake.

Patrick!

(in German) ♪ Happy birthday to you!

Happy birthday to you!

♪ Happy birthday, dear Patrick!

Happy birthday to you!

(cheering)

(in English) Let's go.

What? Are you sure?

Shouldn't we at least burn her car?

Now what?

(Victoras mutters)

(starts engine)

(Angeliki) Victoras?

Victoras?

Victoras?

Victoras!

(Bjarke barks)

Victoras, what are you doing?

- (tyres screech)

- (Bjarke whimpers)

(Angeliki) Bjarke!

Stop! Quiet!

(in Greek) Life is very different here.

You get used to it over time.

I'm more responsible now.

You can count on me.

You drove us here drunk.

You hit my dog.

I wanted ...

It's not like this every day.

We have good days and bad.

Sasha is often away for work.

And I've had enough of being alone.

You have Helga.

And Patrick.

And Bjorke.

Bjarke!

I took Patrick to try diving.

He didn't like it at all.

He was afraid.

He didn't jump.

Not even from one metre!

You, when you were little,

you always told me your dream was to fly.

You remember?

This was your dream.

I remember it well.

Your grandmother always said

you should become a pilot.

I said you should take diving lessons.

I wanted to make your dream come true.

You took me diving

because I was restless

and I was getting on your nerves.

I don't remember that.

But if that was the case,

something good came out of it.

Give me a drag.

Do you want to drive?

(Mathias speaks quietly in German)

Will you help me take him inside?

Helga!

(in German)

You must be starving after all this.

(in English) I should get going probably.

(in German) Don't be silly.

You are part of the family.

# The talented Mr Ripley

From the silence

From the night

Comes a distant

Lullaby

Soul surrendering

your soul

The heart in you not whole

For love

For love...

Walked out

Cast into the dark

Branded with a mark

Of shame

Of Cain... 

(Ripley) 'If I could just go back.

'If I could rub everything out,

'starting with myself.

'Starting with borrowing a jacket.'

Oh, such fleeting paradise

Such innocent delight

To love

Be loved

A lullaby

Then silence... 

- (Woman) Frances, that was lovely.

- You're so kind, thank you.

(Man) Congratulations.

Marvellous, marvellous.

Most enjoyable.

Herbert Greenleaf.

My wife, Emily.

Thank you. Tom Ripley.

- How do you do?

- You were at Princeton.

Most likely you'll know our son,

Dick. Dickie Greenleaf.

- I couldn't 't help noticing the jacket.

- Yes.

Class of '56.

How is Dickie?

(Frances) We've enjoyed meeting you.

I do hope that

you'll come out and see us.

- Thank you. That's very kind.

- Both of you.

- Herbert?

- Yes, yes. I very much hope so.

Of course, Dickie's idea of music

is jazz.

- Oh, dear.

- He has a saxophone.

To my ear, jazz is just noise.

Just an insolent noise.

- Very nice to meet you.

- And you.

We'll see you at the shipyard.

- I hope to.

- Good.

I have to run, I'm very late!

- Ah, you were great!

- You were great.

Darling couple, aren't they?

Yes, they are.

Exceptional young man.

- Thanks a lot for the jacket.

- Thanks for filling in for me.

Take care of that wrist. Bye, Fran.

Believe me.

Buy IBM now, before it splits.

- You'll make yourself a fortune.

- You think so?

(Classical piano)

Sorry. Sorry.

Sorry.

You've probably heard

Dickie's been living in Italy.

Mongibello, south of Naples.

No kind of place at all.

- (Man) Good morning, sir.

- Frank.

Marge, his young lady,

is supposedly writing

some kind of book.

God only knows what he does.

By all accounts, they spend the whole

time on the beach or in a sailboat.

That's my son's talent,

spending his allowance.

Could you ever conceive

of going to Italy, Tom?

Persuade my son to come home?

I'd pay you.

A thousand dollars.

Well, I have always wanted

to go to Europe, sir, but...

Good. Now you can go for a reason.

(Jazz vocalisation)

(Jazz orchestra)

(Ripley) Count Basie.

Duke Ellington? I don't know.

I don't know.

Dizzy Gillespie.

(Chet Baker: "My Funny Valentine")

"My Funny Valentine"...

- (Man and woman arguing)

- Sweet funny Valentine

I don't even know

if this is a man or a woman.

- You make me smile...

- (Crashing)

(Shouting continues)

(Saxophone solo piece)

Charlie Parker?

Charlie Parker. I know it!

It's Bird.

Yes!

- (Recording ends)

- Urgh.

- Here. I'll take it.

- Thanks.

That thousand bucks

should come in handy.

- Yes, sir.

- I'll get that.

- Thank you.

- Sir.

You'll have a great trip. Mr Greenleaf is

personal friends with the Cunard people.

(Italian opera)

I can tell you, the Greenleaf name

opens a lot of doors.

(Horn blasts)

(Announcement in Italian over PA)

(Ripley) Do you speak English?

(Man) What you name, please?

- Ripley.

- Follow me. No problem.

- Here, Signor Ripley.

- Okay.

Uh, there. That one.

- This one.

- Wait, is that all? Count them.

Attenzione.

Just one suitcase, Signor Ripley?

- Si.

- Attenzione.

Oh, Customs.

(Officer speaks Italian)

- What's your secret?

- Excuse me?

No, it's just that...

You are American, aren't you?

No, it's just that...

I have so much luggage,

and you're so, um, streamlined.

It's, you know, humiliating.

(Speaks Italian)

I'm Meredith, by the way.

- Hello, I'm Dickie.

- Meredith Randall.

- Um, Dickie Greenleaf.

- Hello.

You're not the shipping Greenleafs.

Oh, trying not to be.

Trying to jump ship.

So, uh, did they put your cases

in the wrong pile?

It's just that, uh,

you were in the "R" stand.

I thought I saw you there...

My father wants me

back in New York.

He builds boats, I'd rather sail them.

So I travel under my mother's name.

- Which is...

- Emily.

I'm just kidding.

You know, the funny thing is,

I'm not Randall either.

I'm Logue.

- As in...

- As in the textile Logues.

Trying to shrug off the dress.

- I travel under my mother's name too.

- Randall.

Right.

- So, Rome, Rome, Rome.

- Oh.

- We're partners in disguise. Bye.

- Bye.

(Shouting In Italian)

(Driver) Mongibello!

Mongibello!

(Chatting in Italian)

(Singing opera)

(Ripley speaks Italian slowly)

"The fiancée has a face."

(Ripley repeats in Italian)

(Continues in Italian)

(Italian)

"Bird".

"This is my face."

(Italian)

(Marge) So I guess you didn't look

at my new chapter.

(Dickie) I will, Marge. I promise.

It's just been too hot.

(Marge) If I make dinner at my place

tonight, you could look at it then.

Dickie Greenleaf?

- Who's that?

- It's Tom. Tom Ripley.

Tom Ripley?

- We were at Princeton together.

- (Dickie) Okay.

Did we know each other?

Hello.

Well, I knew you, so...

I suppose you must have known me.

Princeton's like a fog.

America's like a fog.

This is Marge Sherwood.

Tom... Sorry, what is it?

- Ripley.

- How do you do?

How do you do, Marge?

- What are you doing in Mongi?

- Nothing, nothing much.

Just passing through.

- Passing through?

- Yeah.

You're so white.

Did you ever see a guy so white,

Marge?

Grey, actually.

It's just an undercoat.

- (Dickie) Say again?

- You know, a primer.

That's funny.

Margie likes that

'cause she's so white too.

Yes, I do, and you're not funny.

You should come and have lunch

with us before you go.

- Yes, Dickie?

- Sure, anytime.

Well...

...coincidence.

I don't remember him.

That's so funny.

(Dickie) Silvana! Hey!

I've been looking all over for you.

Where've you been hiding?

Today you're looking for me.

- And the rest of the week?

- You're always working.

- (Dickie) Come on. Get on.

- With the American girl?

- Huh? Hold on to me.

- I hate you.

- (Dickie) Huh?

- I hate you!

(Marge) Did you suddenly forget

where I lived?

I know. I'm late. I'm a swine.

- It's 4:00.

- I just woke up.

- Ohh.

- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

- You just woke up.

- Fausto and I took the boat out.

We were fishing,

and then it was dawn...

- We caught absolutely nothing.

- Mmm, yes, well.

We ate everything without you.

- We?

- Yes.

- Tom Ripley's here.

- Who?

- Tom. Hello.

- Hi.

- Hello.

- Thought you'd disappeared.

We were gonna send out

a search party.

No, still here.

Tom was telling me

about his journey over.

Made me laugh so hard

I almost got a nosebleed.

- Is that good?

- (Whispers) Shut up.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm despicable. But I love you.

- Do you love me? Do you love me?

- I'm intruding.

Can you mix a martini?

- Sure.

- (Sighs) I'll do it.

- Oh.

- I make a fabulous martini.

(Giggles)

Everybody should have one talent.

What's yours?

Forging signatures,

telling lies,

impersonating practically anybody.

That's three. Nobody should

have more than one talent.

Okay, do an impression.

- Now?

- Yeah.

(As Herbert Greenleaf)

The only talent my son has

is for cashing his allowance.

- What?

- Oh, I like to sail.

Believe me, I love to sail.

- Instead, I make boats.

- Stop!

- Other people sail them.

- It's too much!

You're making all the hairs

on my neck stand up.

Oh, yes, jazz.

Oh, jazz. Let's face it.

It's just, uh...

It's just insolent noise.

I feel like he's here.

Horrible, like the old bastard's

here right now.

- Good.

- That's brilliant.

Brilliant!

How do you know him?

Oh, I met him in New York.

Marge! Marge, this is scary.

You've got to hear this. Meet my father,

Herbert Richard Greenleaf I.

Pleasure to meet you.

Dickie's made a fine catch.

- Uncanny!

- I know Emily thinks so.

- I don't get it.

- It's uncanny.

Could you ever conceive

of going to Italy, Tom,

and, uh, bringing him back?

- What?

- I'd pay you.

If you would go to Italy,

persuade my son to come home,

I'd pay you a thousand dollars.

(Dickie) 'I'm never going back.'

To actually hire somebody

to come all the way here,

to drag me back home...

Got to be a little insane, hasn't he?

- Ciao, Fausto.

- Oh, Dickie!

(Chat in Italian)

- This is Tom.

- Ciao, Tom.

- I'm never going back.

- No, I think...

Your mother, her illness, I think...

It's got nothing to do with my mother.

She's had leukem...

This is what makes me boil about him.

He wants me back.

He wants me back.

- It's got nothing to do with my mother.

- Look, I don't know...

Go back.

Go back to New York.

Or call him, if you can find

a telephone that works,

and tell him wild horses wouldn't

drag me back to him or his shipyard.

- Hi, Tom.

- Hi.

Marge! Tom's saying goodbye.

Oh, I'll come down.

So, uh, did you speak to my father?

Oh, you were right...

about the telephones.

- I told you.

- No lines. There's some problem.

(Dickie) That's Italy.

Tom. You're off?

What are your plans?

Oh, back, I suppose,

as slow as I can. Oh!

This bag!

Hey... you like jazz.

I love jazz.

Oh! This is the best.

Baker, Rollins.

Marge says she likes jazz,

but she thinks Glenn Miller's jazz.

- I never said that!

- Bird, that's jazz.

Bird? Ask me the name

of my sailboat.

I don't know.

What's the name of your sailboat?

Look! Look! "Bird"!

(Marge) Which is ridiculous.

Boats are female.

Everyone knows

you can't call a boat after a man.

- He's not a man. He's a god.

- Okay, we're going to Naples.

There's a club...

It's not a club, it's a cellar.

- It's vile.

- You don't have to come. It's great.

It's great. You're gonna love it.

(Music over dialogue)

How are you?

Oh!

(Singing in Italian)

That'd be cool. Bring him up.

(Italian)

...Tom Ripley!

Come on! Get on up here!

(Italian)

I'll tell you when to join the chorus.

Come on.

Okay, together!

(Dickie) 'I bumped into

an old friend from Princeton.

- 'A fellow called Tom Ripley.'

- (Typewriter clacking)

'He says he's going to haunt me

until I agree

'to go back to New York with him.'

Afternoon.

What time is it?

- Oh, God.

- "Go back to New York with him.

- "Here..."

- You always type your letters?

- That should be two T's.

- I can't write, and I can't spell.

It's the privilege

of a first-class education.

Your room's upstairs at the back.

I think Ermalinda made up the bed.

- Ermalinda!

- Si?

(Both speak Italian)

- This is so good of you.

- Don't say it again.

Now that you're a double agent and

we're going to string my dad along,

what if we were to buy a car

with your expense money?

- Okay.

- Great.

- Hello, Tom.

- Hello.

Marge, Marge, what do you think?

Little Cinquecento

with my dad's money?

Oh, please, Dickie.

You can't even drive a car.

- (Tom) You can't even drive.

- What we need urgently is an icebox.

Agree with me,

and I'll be your friend for life.

- I absolutely agree with Marge.

- Hmm.

Icebox. Icebox.

(Bell tolling)

(Marge) So, what,

is he gonna move in with you?

It'll just be for a little while.

He can be... He makes me laugh.

- (Marge) Okay, darling.

- Promise you'd say?

- No, I like him.

- Marge, you like everybody.

(Marge) Don't like you. Ha-ha!

Then I'll go to your place

and you can move in with Tom.

(Ripley mimics Marge) I like him.

(Mimics Dickie)

Marge, you like everybody.

(Mimics Marge) No, I like him.

(Mimics Dickie)

Marge, you like everybody.

(Dickie) Now you'll find out why

Marge always shows up for breakfast.

It's not love,

it's my coffee machine!

(Marge) Ever since Ermalinda showed

him how to make his own espresso,

he feels like quite the grown-up.

(Dickie) I bought the coffee machine.

(Marge) Oh, darling, is that for me?

This is for Tom,

because he didn't complain.

(Tom) That ring is superb.

Oh, Tom, I love you. See?

Ooh! I had to promise, capital "P",

never to take it off.

- Otherwise, I'd give it to you.

- Isn't it great? I found it in Naples.

I had to bargain for it

for about two weeks.

I hope it wasn't cheap, Marge.

- Oh, it was.

- Ha-ha(!)

I have to get a birthday present for

Frances, so perhaps you could help me.

- Who's Frances?

- My fiancée.

Ahem! Engaged?

You're a dark horse, Ripley.

- Who is she?

- Your parents met her.

Oh, God.

Oh, I can just imagine.

"If only Dickie would settle down.

"Doesn't every parent

deserve a grandchild?"

Oh, God. Never. Never.

I swear on your ring, Marge,

I'm never going back.

(Tom) Say when to pull.

(Dickie) Pull now. Pull.

It's not pulling.

I'm doing it wrong.

- Better now, huh?

- Okay, okay, okay.

We'll make a sailor of you yet!

You're doing really well.

- All right, bar's open.

- Yes, please.

- Hey, can we sail to Venice?

- Sure. I love Venice.

"See Venice and die."

Isn't that right? Or is it Rome?

- Is it Rome?

- I have to see Venice.

You do something and die, don't you?

Okay. Venice is on the list.

And Rome.

Do you ski?

Ah, no, no. Don't tell me.

You're a lost cause.

That's the next thing to deal with.

Christmas, we're planning

a skiing trip to Cortina.

Excellent skiing. Excellent.

Marge. Margie.

Unbelievable, Tom can't ski either.

- We'll have to teach him that too.

- Thank you.

Such little class, Marge.

Does this guy know anything?

It's a good thing

we're not getting married soon.

We'd have to invite Tom

on our honeymoon.

(Marge) 'Oh, I hated New York.

That whole Park Avenue crowd.

'So I fled to Paris to work on my book.'

And I was always going to this café

in Montmartre with Jean-Jacques.

And Dickie would play

"My Funny Valentine".

It was only later that I found out

he only knows about six songs.

Anyway, I looked forward

to seeing him, I suppose.

(Speaks Italian)

(Speaking Italian)

Hey, hey, Signor Greenleaf!

If you're not at my place by 7.00,

Tom and I are running off together.

- Okay, fine.

- (Man) Oh, Dickie!

(Indistinct)

Oh, hold on. Hold on.

Silvana, Silvana

You make me smile 

I need to talk to you.

- You're breaking my ribs!

- What?

You're breaking my ribs!

But don't

Change a hair for me

Not if you care for me

Stay, little Valentine

Stay

Each day is

Valentine's Day... 

Oh! I could fuck this icebox,

I love it so much.

So, what did you actually do

in New York?

Played piano in a few places,

I told you.

Well, that's one job.

You told me a lot of jobs.

Few places. That's a few jobs.

The mysterious Mr Ripley.

Marge and I spent hours

speculating.

Anyway, I don't even want

to think about New York.

Are you ready?

- Cold beer. Thank you, Dad.

- Okay.

Copy out from here.

- You bring this with you to Europe?

- You gonna write something?

I love the fact that you brought

Shakespeare with you but no clothes.

Ermalinda says you wash out

the same shirt every night. Is that true?

No. I have more than one shirt.

She can do that for you.

Anyway, just wear some of my stuff.

Wear anything you want.

Most of it's ancient.

Now your signature.

Not Dickie. Your signature.

Without the glasses,

you're not even ugly.

I don't need them

because I never read.

- How do I look?

- Like Clark Kent.

- Now Superman.

- Superman.

- Okay.

- I know. It's like a kid's.

(Ripley) See this, the "S" and the "T"?

Fine, vulnerable.

That's pain. That's secret pain.

Well, that must be a very deep secret,

'cause I don't know about it.

(Ripley) There's nothing more

naked than your handwriting.

See how nothing's

quite touching the line?

- That's vanity.

- Well, we certainly know that's true.

(Dickie) Do you have any brothers?

(Ripley) No.

No brothers, no sisters.

Me neither.

Nor does Marge.

All only children.

What does that mean?

Means we've never shared a bath.

And I'm cold. Can I get in?

No.

I didn't mean with you in it.

(Dickie) Okay.

Get in. I'm like a prune anyway.

It is me. It's an old picture.

Every time!

"Is it you? It doesn't look like you."

God!

Letters.

Greenleaf and for Ripley.

Ooh, Fran. "I miss you.

When are you coming home?

"Stop telling me what

an incredible time you're having.

- "How much you love Dickie."

- Whoo!

"And Marge and Mongibello."

And this one, I think,

is from your father.

(Dickie vocalizing jazz)

- Let me see it. What does he say?

- He's getting impatient.

He wants me to reassure him you're

going to be home by Thanksgiving.

You've got to get a new jacket.

Really.

You must be sick

of wearing the same clothes.

I can't. I can't keep spending

your father's money.

I love how responsible you are.

My dad should make you

chief accountant or something.

Or when I take over,

which is never, I will.

Okay. When you take over,

which is never, I'll accept.

Let me buy you a jacket. When we get

to Rome, there's a great place...

- Battistoni.

- Battistoni.

(Sings in Italian)

Roma, we're taking Tom to Roma

We're going to a-Roma 

(Chatting in Italian)

Buon giorno. Nice sweater.

Where do we get a carrozza

for the Forum?

- Can we just hire any of them?

- Relax.

Relax!

It's just there's so much to do

in a single day.

Most important is where to eat.

I hope Freddie made a reservation.

Freddie?

Freddie. Freddie Miles.

Freddie's organising

the Cortina skiing trip.

Oh.

Oh, here he is.

(Tyres screech)

- Frederico!

- Come stai?

- Bene!

- Ciao, bello! Come stai?

Oh, God, don't you want to fuck

every woman you see just once?

- Only once?

- Absolutely. Once. Ciao.

- Tom Ripley, Freddie Miles.

- Tom.

I mean, hey, if I'm late,

think what her husband's saying.

- You look gorgeous.

- As always.

So... mangiare.

Si. I got us a table outside

at Fabrizio's. Tommy.

Outstanding. I tell you,

I'm so cabin-crazy with Mongi.

I know. I was there.

(Jazz playing)

Look, Tom, we gotta go to a club

and meet some friends of Freddie's.

The best thing is, if you want

to be a tourist, grab a cab now,

and I'll meet you

at the railway station.

What club?

Freddie's arranged it

with some of the skiing crowd.

Come if you want, but I thought

you wanted to go sightseeing.

I do, and then maybe get

the jacket and what have you.

Dick! You gotta hear this!

Listen, just take one of mine

when we get back.

Don't worry about it.

Come on.

Ciao. Have fun, okay?

(Knocking)

You said to make sure you didn't

miss the train. Leaves at 8.00.

(Snickers)

- Have a good time.

- See ya, Tommy.

(Wolf whistles)

(Whistle blows)

If I meant anything to her

I'd be brave,

and here's the song I'd bring to her

I'd sing to her

May I be the only one

To say I

Really fell in love the day I

First set eyes on you

- May I... 

- What are you doing?

Oh. I was just amusing myself.

- Sorry.

- I wish you'd get out of my clothes.

- Do you have my shoes on too?

- You said pick out a jacket, so...

Could you get undressed

in your own room?

- Thought you missed the train.

- Freddie drove me back in his car.

- Is Freddie here?

- He's downstairs.

I was just fooling around.

Don't say anything.

I was just fooling around.

Sorry.

(Freddie) God, a corduroy jacket in Italy.

- (Marge) Morning, Tom.

- Morning.

- (Chuckles)

- Come join us.

Hey. I want this job of yours, Tommy.

I was just saying, you live in Italy,

you stay at Dickie's house,

you eat Dickie's food,

you wear his clothes,

and his father picks up the tab.

(Chuckles)

If you get bored, you let me know,

'cause I'll do it.

- I'll do it.

- (Dickie) 'To the mainland!'

You really should go in.

It's marvellous.

I'm fine.

(Dickie and Freddie shouting)

Are you okay?

Sure.

The thing with Dickie...

It's like the sun shines on you,

and it's glorious.

And then he forgets you

and it's very, very cold.

So I'm learning.

When you have his attention, you feel

like you're the only person in the world.

That's why everybody loves him.

It's always the same. Whenever

someone new comes into his life...

Freddie, Fausto,

Peter Smith-Kingsley.

He's wonderful. Have you met him?

Especially you.

And that's just the boys.

Come and get him! Come and get him!

Tell me, why is it that when men play,

they always play at killing each other?

(Dickie) He's drowning me!

He's drowning me!

- I'm sorry about Cortina, by the way.

- What about Cortina?

Didn't... Didn't Dick say?

He spoke to Freddie and...

apparently it's not going to work out.

It's because everyone else can ski

and it affects where you stay and...

(Dickie) Come on, Freddie.

At least stick around

for the Festival of the Madonna.

- The whole town comes out...

- I don't think so.

I have my own Madonna back in Rome.

Why don't you come back with me?

A lot of ladies. Ooh!

(Sniggers)

- Oh, God.

- You want to take over?

Yeah, sure.

Just point her at Capri.

Avoid the rocks.

Where are you going?

Marge maintenance.

Aye-aye.

(Marge and Dickie murmuring)

(Marge) Don't.

(Scoffs)

(Marge) Dickie...

Tommy... how's the peeping?

Tommy, how's the peeping?

Tommy, Tommy,

Tommy, Tommy, Tommy...

(Chanting in Italian)

(People applaud)

(Chanting continues)

(Screams)

Is someone getting an ambulance?

- Is someone getting an ambulance?

- (Wailing)

(Crowd chant prayers)

(Shouting)

What's the fight about?

That's her fiancé, isn't it?

I don't know.

Why are you asking me?

(Ripley) Are they blaming him?

How can it take an hour

to find an ambulance?

She was already dead, darling,

wasn't she? So I suppose...

I don't know why people say

this country is civilised.

- Dickie!

- It isn't. It's fucking primitive.

I'll go see what's the matter.

I'll go.

(Solo saxophone)

(Tom) I know why you're upset.

I know about Silvana, Dickie.

I know about you and Silvana.

What about us?

You don't have to clean up!

Really!

- Like what?

- Forget it.

She was pregnant.

Did you know that?

Silvana was pregnant.

Do you know what that means

in a place like this?

I'm prepared to take the blame.

- What are you talking about?

- You've been so good to me.

You're the brother I never had.

I'm the brother you never had.

I would do anything for you, Dickie.

She came to me for help.

She needed money.

I didn't help her.

I didn't help her.

Now she's drowned herself,

and it's my fault.

I'm not going to say anything

to Marge, to the police or anybody.

It's a secret between us, Dickie.

And I'll keep it.

(Tom) "Dear Tom.

In view of the fact Dickie shows

"no more signs of coming home than

before you went..." Blah, blah, blah.

Erm..."I hope that the trip has

afforded you some pleasure,

"despite the failure

of its main objective.

"You no longer should consider

yourself obligated to us in any way."

Can't blame him.

You could hardly expect this

to go on forever, Tom.

Well, you can write again.

- Especially now we're brothers.

- I can't.

How can I, in all decency?

You said it yourself.

It's my dad's money you're spending.

We've had a great run though,

haven't we?

Well, we'll still go to Venice.

We could stick to that plan.

I don't think so, Tom.

You can't pay your own way, can you?

It's time we all moved on.

I'm sick of Mongi.

Especially now, with everything...

I really want to move to the north.

I need to check out

San Remo next week.

Find somewhere new

to keep the boat.

It would be great, though,

if you came with me to San Remo.

There's a great jazz festival.

We could say goodbye in style.

What do you think?

Our last trip!

Sure.

(Speaking Italian)

Why do you do

that thing with your neck?

What thing?

On trains,

you always do that thing.

Spooky.

Spook-k-k-k-k-k-ky.

(Mimics jazz percussion)

Spooky.

Oh! Didn't I tell you

San Remo was crazy?

This is more like it! Come on!

To Mongibello

and the happiest days of my life.

To Mongi.

You're cheerful tonight.

I'm suddenly quite happy

to be going back.

Did I know you at Princeton, Tom?

I don't think I did, did I?

- Why are you asking all of a sudden?

- No reason.

Because you're leaving, I guess.

I don't think you were there.

- Why?

- I mean it as a compliment.

You've got such great taste.

Most of the thugs at Princeton had

tasted everything and had no taste.

I used to say, "The cream of America,

rich and thick."

Freddie's the perfect example.

Then I'll take it as a compliment.

I knew it! I knew it.

Marge and I had a bet.

Do you even like jazz,

or was that for my benefit?

- I've gotten to like it.

- Oh, yes!

I've gotten to like everything

about the way you live.

It's one big love affair.

If you knew my life

back home in New York...

I'm thinking of giving up the sax.

What do you think

about the drums?

- What?

- So cool.

I'm gonna rent a boat tomorrow,

take a look around.

This is how I found

my place in Mongi.

Took a boat out...

...around the bay,

first thing I liked, I got it.

- Whoa!

- Come on, Dickie. Don't go crazy.

- Dickie. Slow down!

- Ha-ha! Hold on!

Wait a minute!

It's gonna tip! Oh, God!

Stop it! Somebody!

Somebody! Stop it!

(Shouting)

Oh, I love it here!

I love it here!

I'm gonna move here!

Beautiful.

(Mimics jazz percussion)

- I want to tell you my plan.

- Oh, God!

So tell me.

Well, I thought I'd come back

in the new year under my own steam.

- Really? To Italy?

- Of course.

And I figured,

just for argument's sake,

say I got a place.

Or say we split the rent

on a house,

I could get a job, or, better still,

if I got a place in Rome,

and then when we're there,

we could be there, and when

we're here, we could be here.

- I don't think so.

- Particularly with the Marge problem.

You just blame me.

- Marge and I are getting married.

- How?

How?

Yesterday, you were ogling girls

on the terrace.

Today you're getting married?

That's absurd.

- I love Marge.

- You love me. You're not marrying me.

- Tom, I don't love you.

- No, I don't mean that as a threat.

To be honest,

I'm a little relieved you're going.

I think we've seen enough

of each other for a while.

- What?

- You can be a leech!

You know that!

And... it's boring.

You can be quite boring.

The funny thing is, I'm not pretending

to be somebody else, and you are.

Boring.

I've been absolutely honest with you

about my feelings.

Boring.

But you... First of all,

I know there's something.

That evening, when we played chess,

for instance, it was obvious.

- What evening?

- No, it's dangerous for you to take on.

Oh, no, no. We're brothers.

Hey. And then you do

this sordid thing with Marge,

fucking her on the boat,

while we all have to listen,

which was excruciating.

You follow your cock around like a...

And now you're getting married.

No, I'm bewildered. Forgive me.

You're lying to Marge and

then you're getting married to her.

You're knocking up Silvana.

You're ruining everybody...

You want to play the sax. You want

to play the drums. Which is it, Dickie?

What are you actually?

Who are you? Huh?

Some third-class mooch? Who are you?

Who are you to say anything to me?

Who are you to tell me anything?

Actually, I really, really do not want

to be on this boat with you.

- I can't move without you moving.

- Shut up.

It gives me the creeps.

You give me the creeps.

- You shut up.

- "Dickie, Dickie!" like a little girl.

Shut up!

Oh, God, Dickie.

- God's sake.

- Oh... Oh God!

Okay. Okay.

- We have to get you...

- (Screams)

I'm gonna kill you! Kill you!

(Screaming)

You're dead!

Stop! Stop! Please! Please!

- (Screaming)

- Stop it! Stop!

- Dickie, let go!

- I'll kill you!

Stop! Stop! Stop!

(Panting)

Can I have my key, please?

Of course.

You must be very cold.

Uh, Signor Greenleaf, yes?

No. I'm...

(Keyboard clacking)

- Hello, Marge.

- (Screams)

Tom!

You startled me.

- Sorry.

- You're back!

- How are you? Your book going well?

- Yes.

I'm on a good streak, thank you.

I was just... looking at you.

So quiet.

Where's Dickie?

I think he's planning on staying

in Rome for a few days.

Rome? Ahh.

Did he say why?

I don't understand Dickie.

Your guess is as good as mine.

What does that mean?

Oh, one day I'm invited skiing,

the next day I'm not.

One day, we're one family,

then the next day he wants to be alone.

You tell me.

Is that what he said?

He wants to be alone?

He was thinking of you.

He asked me to deliver this.

Thank you.

He knows I love this.

But why it couldn't have waited...

Errand number one:

Deliver Marge's perfume.

Errand number two:

Pack some clothes

and his precious saxophone.

How long is he staying for?

Search me.

I guess we're abandoned.

(Marge) Goddamn it!

(Tom) Are you okay?

There was a letter from Dickie

in with my perfume.

You realize it's more

than just a few days.

He's thinking of moving to Rome.

The thing is,

the night before he left, we...

we talked about moving together...

...somewhere north

and I suppose I...

...put some pressure on him

about getting married.

I just...

I just might have scared him off.

There's a side to him...

when our heads

are on the pillow...

I know no one else sees

that's so tender.

I think I should come

with you to Rome and confront him.

He hates being confronted.

I think you're right.

Grazie. Checking in.

Checking in.

- Signor Ripley?

- It's me.

Signor Greenleaf.

Of course. Welcome back.

Thank you.

- (Woman) 'Pronto?'

- I'd like to telephone the Hotel Goldoni.

- 'Si, signor.'

- I want to speak to Thomas Ripley.

- Ripley? Subito.

- Yes. Grazie.

(Phone buzzes)

- Pronto.

- 'Signor Ripley's not there.'

- He's not there?

- 'No, signor.'

Well, I would like

to leave a message.

I'll leave a message.

"Got your call.

Dinner tonight... sounds fine.

"Ripley."

- Dickie Greenleaf.

- (Woman) 'Dickie Greenleaf.'

- Yes. Greenleaf.

- 'Greenleaf.'

At the Grand.

(Tom) And I'd like to have

this wallet embossed.

I don't know the word in Italian.

Embossed.

Of course, Signor Greenleaf.

Thank you.

Dickie! It's...

- Oh, my gosh.

- Meredith.

- Ciao!

- Ciao. Come in. Come in.

But you're going skiing

with those Yankees, aren't you?

- What?

- At Christmas. To Cortina.

- With Freddie Miles.

- How did you know that?

Oh! Everybody knows Freddie Miles.

Is Freddie in Rome?

- Now?

- Yeah.

Oh, I don't think so.

But I... But I've met him, of course,

and we've chatted.

And I know about you...

and Marge in Mongi.

What an unreliable rat you are.

Well, Freddie said

you were a rat.

And I thought to myself,

"Ah, now I know

why he travels under 'R."'

I've left Marge, Meredith.

And Mongi.

- So the rat's here in Rome.

- Oh, I'm sorry.

- Oh, I've never been happier.

- I would not have made a joke.

I- I feel like

I've been handed a new life.

The truth is that

if you've had money your entire life,

either you despise it,

which we do... Agreed?

You're only truly comfortable

around other people...

who have it and despise it.

I know.

I've never admitted that to anyone.

(Chattering in Italian)

(Meredith) Because my friend

Mr Greenleaf, Signor Greenleaf and I,

- are on a little spending spree.

- (Man) I see.

We're behaving very badly.

Oh, I love Italian money. So dark.

Doesn't make you feel guilty.

- Gr-r-razie.

- Thank you.

I don't want too many large bills.

No one will change them.

Tutto bene,

Signor Greenleaf.

(Counting in Italian)

(Italian)

- I really like this too.

- I think I'm having that too.

(Italian)

- Tomorrow.

- (Italian)

- Arrivederci.

- Arrivederci. Oops!

- Ciao.

- Ciao.

I know you're a jazz fiend,

but do you absolutely hate the opera?

I've... I've...

been trying to give

my tickets away.

It's tomorrow. But if you

were prepared to be dragged...

You could drag me.

(Opera in Italian)

(Shot Fires)

(Body thuds)

(Audience applauding)

Feodor Chaliapin.

It's the whole Russian baritone.

Thank you so much

for inviting me tonight.

Can you bear it?

We hear you are a friend of Freddie's.

He has "I hate opera"

tattooed on his chest.

There's room for a whole libretto

on Freddie's chest.

I'm sure we've met before.

I was sure we'd met before.

Weren't you, Ted?

Dick is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.

- I know.

- Yes, I think we have.

One minute you people are children,

and the next you're getting tattooed.

- Cheers.

- Cheers.

Cheers.

- Excuse me.

- Prego.

Oh! Excuse me.

- Hello.

- Hello.

- Tom!

- Marge!

How are you?

What are you doing in Rome?

- Is he here? Are you with Dickie?

- No. Um, no.

Um, hello.

Um, I'm Tom Ripley.

Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard

all about you from Marge and Dickie.

- Ditto.

- No-no glasses.

So, where are you hiding him?

He's impossible, isn't he?

Is he really not here?

Marge, you know Dickie has

"I hate opera" tattooed on his chest.

- I thought you were going to Venice.

- Yes, what happened with that?

I heard you were desperate

to come.

I was rather looking forward

to rowing you around.

- (Bell ringing)

- I am. I really am.

I've been travelling, and I just

can't seem to get that far north.

Well, you should hurry,

before we sink.

Look, let me give you

the telephone number.

There. Oh, look.

There's Meredith.

Meredith. What's her name, Marge?

The textile people.

Erm, come on. Some of us spent

Christmas at her house.

I don't know her.

He hasn't called.

He's hardly written.

Just these cryptic notes,

you know?

- You don't just dump people.

- (Bell rings)

Look, will we see you later,

or are you with people?

- Uh, I can't later.

- Well, how about tomorrow?

Yes, uh,

maybe in the morning?

Do you know Cafe Dinelli

at the Piazza di Spagna?

- I know the Piazza di Spagna. Time?

- 10:30?

- We'll be there.

- Okay.

So I'll see you

in the morning, Marge?

10:30?

Very nice to meet you.

(Peter) And you.

Come on.

Come on. Let's go back in.

I don't understand

why Tom's still in Rome.

- Let's go.

- I thought you were enjoying yourself.

Let's take a carrozza

and look at the moon.

Are you crazy?

It's freezing out there.

Come on. I need to talk to you.

Just the two of us.

(Meredith) Okay.

(Meredith)

Don't worry, please.

Don't worry.

You're such a pal to understand. I...

It's like Marge is here right now.

I look at you,

and I see her face.

And I can't... No matter what

I'm feeling towards you...

No. I absolutely... understand.

Otherwise, you'd be fighting me off.

Beating you away.

Look, will you meet me

tomorrow?

Just to say goodbye properly,

you know, in the daylight,

so it's not just this.

Of course. Meredith, I'm sorry.

Of course I'll meet you.

You should always

save pain for daylight.

Why don't we have coffee

in the morning at Dinelli's?

Uh, by the Spanish Steps.

Exactly. 10:30?

- 10:15.

- Okay.

Okay.

(Bell tolling)

(Tolling continues)

(Italian)

(Chattering, Indistinct)

- (Peter) Grazie.

- Peter?

Hello. Its Meredith Logue.

(Peter) Of course it is.

Meredith, hello. Sorry.

- I was half asleep. How are you?

- How are you?

This is Marge Sherwood.

Meredith Logue.

How do you do?

Do join us, won't you?

We're just waiting for a friend.

I-I won't, actually.

I think there's...

- It was you at the opera last night?

- Uh...

Are you waiting for Dickie?

Dickie? Do you- Do you-

Do you know Dickie?

You were at the opera.

Oh, that explains- Yes, I was there.

I was there with Dickie.

(Exhales) I knew it.

I told you.

Marge, I don't know you,

so I've got no right to...

Dickie loves you.

He's- Well-

I think you'll find

he's on his way home to you.

(Sighs) Well, how-how-how

would you know that?

He... told me everything.

No, I was supposed to meet him

15 minutes ago, so, uh,

I'm gonna go now, I think.

God, unless he meant us to meet.

That'd be a little cruel, wouldn't it?

Ah no, we're meeting another friend.

- Tom Ripley.

- Do you know Tom Ripley?

No, no. I've heard about him, of course,

but I didn't meet him, no.

- (Italian)

- Not for me. No, grazie.

Hope I didn't complicate matters.

God, nothing, nothing...

untoward happened.

No, there is nothing to prevent you

from welcoming him back,

from marrying him.

Goodbye. I'm happy to put

a face to a name.

Goodbye, Peter.

Please, don't get up.

(Marge) Now I don't know what to

think. Do you think he's coming back?

Sorry- Sorry.

Had to renew my papers.

Never one stamp when they can

make you line up for three.

- Have you been waiting long?

- Not at all.

- Morning, Tom.

- Hi. Sorry.

You okay? You look like

you've seen a ghost

Dickie was at the opera

last night.

I don't believe that.

Uh- Wild horses couldn't drag Dickie-

(Laughs) Well, he was there

with someone, you know,

so I suppose she must

have dragged him.

It's not fair.

I think I'm going back to Mongi.

I think Dickie's coming home.

Really? I- Well,

that's just swell.

No, you know,

you're way ahead of me. Great.

That was rather moving

when I heard... I'm sorry.

Meredith is the American girl

I saw at the opera last night.

- She's been seeing something of Dickie.

- Oh, my God.

But the point is,

Dickie- and we all know this

Dickie loves Marge.

And he misses her.

I feel guilty.

Marge doesn't understand this,

but whenever Dickie does

something, I feel guilty.

(Chuckles)

As if that makes sense.

(Italian)

(Choir singing in Italian)

(Knocking at door)

(Knocking)

(Freddie) Dickie.

- (Knocking)

- Dickie, come on. It's me.

It's Freddie. Let me in.

Dickie.

Hello, Freddie.

It's Tom.

Um, where's Dickie?

How are you?

I'm good. Uh, yes, thank you.

He's gone. He went to dinner.

- He's at Otello's. You know Otello's?

- No, no, no.

I don't think he's at dinner

at 6:30pm.

If you said he was still at lunch,

maybe I'd believe you.

You know? Incredible.

I mean, the guy just, you know,

disappeared off the face of the earth.

I guess.

The landlady,

as far as I could tell-

The landlady said

he was here right now.

Search the place.

I just don't know why you'd imagine

that Dickie would hide from you.

Because he's been

hiding from me.

- What happened at Christmas?

- What about Christmas?

He was supposed to come skiing.

I didn't get a cable...

or a call or a little note or a-

- (Grunts)

- Frankly, a fart.

Well, he's been very involved

with his music.

Um, I think his theory... is...

that you have to go into a cocoon,

uh, before you can be a butterfly.

Which is horse shit.

You hear him play this thing?

Well, he can't.

How did you find him?

It's such an out-of-the-way apartment.

Can I fix you a drink?

No, thanks.

At the American Express.

(Strikes random keys)

Some kid.

(Strikes keys)

Are you living here?

No, no. I'm staying here

for a few days.

- But-

- (Strikes keys)

It's a new piano.

Probably shouldn't...

(Striking keys)

- Probably shouldn't-

- (Strikes keys)

Did this place come furnished?

It doesn't look like Dickie's, uh-

It's really horrible, isn't it?

It's so, uh, bourgeois.

Oh, that's a, uh-

You should- Watch that.

Excuse- Excuse me.

Excuse me.

In fact, the only thing

that looks like Dickie... is you.

- Hardly.

- Hmm.

Have you done something

to your hair?

Is there something

you'd like to say, Freddie?

- What?

- Something you'd like to say?

I think I'm saying it.

Something's going on.

Either he's converted to Christianity,

or there's something else.

Well, I would suggest you

ask Dickie that yourself.

Otello's is on della Croce

just off the Corso.

Is it on della Croce

just off the Corso?

Sure. You're a quick study,

aren't you?

Last time you didn't know

you ass from your elbow,

and now you're giving me directions.

That's not fair. You probably do know

your ass from your elbow.

I'll see you.

(Door closes)

(Italian)

(Freddie)

No Dickie Greenleaf. Thomas Ripley.

(Italian)

Ciao, Dickie.

Dickie doesn't play the piano.

(Freddie) Tommy.

Tommy!

(Freddie groaning)

(Tom grunting)

(Man and woman chattering)

Oh! (Laughs)

You're making me laugh.

No. You're just so drunk.

Oh. You're just...

What can you do, eh?

You should see my other friends.

- What can you do?

- (Italian)

Yes. Such a pig.

- (Laughs)

- (Italian)

(Mimics Freddie) Hey, if I'm drunk,

think what her husband's saying.

- La polizia.

- Dickie Greenleaf?

- Yes.

- Inspector Roverini.

- Can we come in?

- Please.

It's a terrible shock, huh?

W-What time did Signor Miles

leave yesterday?

Um, I can't be certain

exactly. I-

8:00, 9:00.

(Italian)

We'd both taken on, uh,

far too many drinks.

But it was dark. It was certainly dark

when I- when I walked him to his car.

So he drove away,

and, uh, you did what?

- I went to bed.

- (Italian)

Freddie's a big man, but I'm

in trouble after a couple of drinks.

I've been suffering all-

Who found him?

(Italian)

You understand, I must ask you...

to stay in Rome,

Signor Greenleaf.

Yes, if it's gonna help, certainly.

So, the doctor,

he has to make the, um-

(Italian)

- Postmortem.

- Yeah, exactly.

But, you know,

his first conclusion...

was that Signor Miles was killed

not later than 7:00 yesterday evening.

Well, he certainly wasn't dead

when he drove away in his car.

No.

(Chattering)

(Italian)

(Italian) It's okay.

- Okay?

- Si, si.

- Did he kill Freddie?

- Marge.

- When did you get here?

- Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?

I'd swear he didn't.

Of course he didn't.

I tried again.

Waiting here, watching for him.

Instead, it's you.

Whenever I look for Dickie, I find you.

What happened to your face?

Dickie- Dickie did it.

- Dickie?

- My face. There was an argument.

I- I said some things

I shouldn't have said and I-

About you. About the appalling way

he's treating you, all of us.

And the next thing I know,

he's launched himself at me.

- Are you getting on?

- What?

Get on.

I'll take you to him.

(Italian)

(Engine stops)

- Where does he live?

- We passed it a few blocks back.

It's where the police were.

The Palazzo Gioia.

They don't even know I'm in Rome,

and I'm not gonna incriminate Dickie.

Well, perhaps

I shouldn't go either.

No. Go if you want to, but just

don't talk to the police about my face.

If they know he hit me and his temper,

then he could've hit Freddie.

I'll catch up with you later.

(Engine starts)

(Italian)

Signor Greenleaf!

It's Signor Greenleaf!

Presto, presto!

(Shouting in Italian)

Open the door!

Open up!

- (Italian)

- I live here!

Mr Greenleaf!

Can we go up?

Do you mind?

Of course.

What happened to your face?

My scooter. I fell off

getting chased by photographers.

The telephone, the press,

I've been... I'm feeling hounded.

Do you think you could

not give out my address?

Never. We've had many requests and, of

course, we say no, even to your fiancée.

I really don't want

to see anybody.

- Even your fiancée?

- Even her.

(Man speaking Italian)

- (Roverini) What about Thomas Ripley?

- What about Tom Ripley?

You and Signor Ripley went

to San Remo. Is that right?

Yes, we- We went to San Remo.

That was months ago.

November, I thought.

Was it?

- Did you speak to Tom?

- November 7 is my information.

I don't remember

the exact date.

- When did you last see Signor Ripley?

- A few days ago.

- Does he stay with you here?

- No.

No.

Here is a pattern.

Two days ago,

Freddie Miles is dead, hmm?

He leaves your apartment

and he's murdered.

Yesterday, a little boat is found

in San Remo full of rocks.

And the owner tells the police

it was stolen on November 7.

We look at hotel records...

and we see...

Dickie Greenleaf

is staying in San Remo.

And then our boatman remembers

two Americans taking a boat.

That is not a pattern.

That's a coincidence.

There must be 50 hotels

in San Remo.

There were probably a hundred people

renting a boat that day.

Thirty-one people.

Thirty-one, yeah.

(Italian)

- Marge Sherwood.

- That is Miss Sherwood now.

Let her in.

Let her in. What's the difference?

Let her in.

No! Actually-

Actually, no.

I would- I would

really appreciate it...

if you would ask Miss Sherwood

to come back later.

(Italian)

Thank you.

May I ask you-

Why would you speak to your friend

and not your fiancée?

Well, I-

I think I just said.

Um, Mr Ripley was

handling some business for me.

Nor does Mr Ripley

want to marry me...

and ask me every single day

if I'll marry him...

and when.

Do you keep a photograph

of Signor Ripley?

I'm not in the habit of carrying

around photographs of my male friends.

Now I think I've upset you.

Sorry. My English, perhaps,

is coarse.

It is a little coarse, yes.

I'm sorry.

But you- No one has seen

Signor Ripley since San Remo.

- I have.

- You have, yes.

And so has Miss Sherwood.

Ask her. And, um,

if I can remember the name

of the hotel he was staying at...

Um, the Goldoni.

Tom was staying at the Goldoni.

Goldoni. The Goldoni.

Good, good, but...

Yes, you are right.

You are right.

A coincidence.

(Siren wailing)

(Sighing)

I look forward to our next meeting.

Hmm? When I will be

more careful with my English.

(Roverini) Ah. I have a witness

who thinks they saw two men...

getting into Mr Miles' car.

And she wants to identify you

in a confronto.

Line-up. Tomorrow, then?

Uh, tomorrow.

(Chuckles)

- Buon giorno, Miss Sherwood.

- Buon giorno.

He's in, but I really don't think

he wants to meet anybody.

(Knocking)

Dick?

Dickie?

I know you can hear me.

(Sighing)

I was gonna say that I would count to

three, and if you didn't open the door...

But I won't count any more.

On you.

I won't count on you any more.

Whatever it is you've done

or haven't done,

you've broken my heart.

That's one thing

I know you're guilty of.

And I don't know why.

(Sobbing)

I don't know why.

I just don't know why.

(Footsteps receding)

(Typewriter keys clattering)

(Thunder rumbling)

(Tom's voice) 'My dear Tom.

'I'm getting out of this.

'Freddie's death. Silvana.

'I've thought about going to the police,

but I can't do it

'I can't face it.

'I can't face anything any more.

'I wish I could give you

the life I took for granted.'

(Typewriter bell dings,

clattering continues)

'You've always understood

what's at the heart of me, Tom.

'Marge never could.

'I suppose that's why

I'm writing this to you,

'the brother I never had.

'The only true friend I ever had.

'In all kinds of ways,

'you're much more like the son

my father wanted.

'I realize you can change the people,

'change the scenery;

'but you can't change

your own rotten self.

'Now I can't think what to do

or where to go.

'I'm haunted by everything

I've done and can't undo.

'I'm sorry.

'I've made a mess of being

Dickie Greenleaf, haven't I?'

Tom!

I'll see you over there!

(Bell tolling)

I'm so sorry to put you through this,

Peter.

I just can't face going to the police

by myself when my Italian's so rotten.

Don't be so daft.

It's fine.

I'm delighted you finally

made it to Venice.

I'm delighted, contrary to rumour,

that you're still in one piece.

- What rumour?

- Oh, you know.

That Dickie murdered you

and is travelling under your passport.

I know. It's ridiculous.

(Man shouting in Italian)

(Shouting continues)

(Phone ringing)

Welcome to Venice.

God, this place reeks, doesn't it?

Can you smell it?

Anyway, I've got to the bottom

of the delay, finally.

We're waiting

for someone from Rome.

What do you mean?

They've sent for someone from Rome?

- Well, yes. That's good, isn't it?

- No, I thought...

that didn't happen in Italy,

that each region is separate.

I was sure that-

I've read that-

You've read the papers.

You know what a big deal it's been.

- American tourist murdered.

- Actually, can we not do this now?

- The stench really is-

- (Man speaking Italian)

(Italian)

(Continues in Italian)

He's taken over the case, because

they're annoyed that the previous chap...

let Dickie disappear

when he was, um,

the only suspect

in Freddie's murder.

(Italian)

In Rome,

about three weeks ago.

I knew that one.

Um-

(Italian)

(Italian)

Are you a homosexual?

Interesting non sequitur.

No.

- No.

- Oh.

By the way, um, officially

there are no Italian homosexuals.

Makes Michelangelo and

Leonardo very inconvenient.

Eh?

Tell him...

I have a fiancée.

And Dickie has a fiancée.

And that Freddie Miles

probably had a string of them.

(Italian)

Mamma mia.

(Italian)

- (Inspector laughing)

- (Chuckling)

- What did he say?

- He says "so many fiancées."

(Italian)

He's asking...

if you killed Freddie Miles...

- and then killed Dickie Greenleaf.

- No!

No, I did not kill Freddie Miles

and then kill Dickie Greenleaf.

Is he accusing me?

Ask him if he's accusing me.

- Here, it's better to be less volatile.

- But it's absurd.

(Italian)

They found this

in Dickie's place in Rome.

- You opened this?

- Of course.

It's a suicide note.

You asked me all these questions

and you already read this suicide note?

I don't believe that letter.

Do you?

Dickie's letter.

Do you believe it?

I don't know what to believe.

Can you imagine, though, if he did

kill Freddie, what that must be like?

Just to wake up every morning.

I mean, how can you?

Just wake up and be a person?

Drink your coffee.

Well, whatever you do,

however terrible, however hurtful,

it all makes sense,

doesn't it, in your head.

You never meet anybody

who thinks they're a bad person.

No, I know, but you're still tormented.

You must be. You've killed someone.

Don't you just take the past

and put it in a room in the basement,

and lock the door

and never go in there?

- That's what I do.

- God, yes.

But, of course, in my case,

it's probably a whole building.

And then you meet someone special,

and all you want to do

is toss them the key.

Say "Open up. Step inside."

But you can't...

- (Resumes playing)

- Because it's dark...

and there are demons.

And if anybody saw

how ugly it is-

Now that's the music talking.

It's harder to be bleak if you're

playing "Knees Up, Mother Brown."

I keep wanting to do that.

Fling... the door open.

(Resumes playing)

Just let the light in,

clean everything out.

If I could take a giant eraser

and rub out everything,

starting with myself-

The thing is, Peter, if-

- Hmm?

- If...

If...

No key, huh?

(Boy singing in Latin)

- Marge.

- Peter.

- So good to see you.

- Hello, Marge.

Tom.

- I see you found Peter.

- I think we sort of found each other.

- Where's Dickie's father?

- He's not coming till the morning.

Evidently his stomach. I don't think

the food here is agreeing with him.

Oh, I was looking forward

to seeing him.

Dickie hasn't killed himself.

I'm sure of that.

There's a private detective

on the case now.

A Mr MacCarron

Dickie's father's employed.

- That's a terrific idea.

- He's American.

He's already discovered that

Dickie cashed cheques for $1,000...

the day before he disappeared.

(Man) Signora.

Is that what you do

before you jump into the Tiber?

I don't think so.

- Is this you?

- No, it's Tom's.

Splendid, eh?

Golly. Who's paying for this?

Peter found it for me.

I can afford it because

it's damp and... falling down.

- Tom's transformed it.

- This is spectacular.

That's why

Tom wanted you to stay.

It's better than trying

to squeeze into my room.

And I know

how you hate hotels.

A hotel would have been fine.

We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf

how far his dollar stretched.

What's funny?

I was just thinking about

when Tom first came to Mongibello.

- And look at you now?

- Look at me what?

To the manor born.

(Bell tolling)

(Tom) Mr Greenleaf?

Mr Greenleaf?

Tom. How are you?

You look well.

- Thank you, sir. I am well.

- Far cry from New York.

- Yes, it is.

- Marge.

Good morning.

Unusual weather.

- Very.

- And you, sir. Any better?

Pretty good.

Sticking with hot water.

- Where's Mr MacCarron?

- San Remo.

The police are amateurs.

Well, my boy, it's come

to a pretty pass, hasn't it?

What is the detective hoping

to find in San Remo?

He's being thorough.

I'm learning about my son, Tom.

Now he's missing,

I'm learning a great deal about him,

and I hope that you can fill in

some more blanks for me.

Marge has been good enough

to do that about Mongibello.

I'll try my best, sir. Obviously,

I'll do anything to help Dickie.

Good. This theory,

the letter he left for you.

The police think that's a clear indication

he was planning on doing something,

uh, to himself.

I just don't believe that.

You don't want to, dear.

I'd like to talk to Tom alone.

Perhaps this afternoon.

Would you mind?

Marge, what a man may say

to his sweetheart...

and what he'll admit

to another fellow-

Such as?

(Clears throat) What a waste

of lives... and opportunities.

I'd pay that fellow a hundred dollars

right now to shut up!

No, Marge doesn't know

the half of it.

And his passport photo.

Did you hear? To scratch out

his own face like that?

Can you imagine?

Frame of mind

you'd have to be in?

"I've thought about going to the police,

but I can't face it.

"I can't face anything any more."

I feel guilty.

I feel like I pushed him away.

I feel like I spoke

and he heard you.

Well... (Clears throat)

If we all pushed him away,

what about him pushing us away?

You've been a great friend

to my son.

Everything is someone else's fault.

We all want to sow wild oats,

but somebody's got to-

got to-

What is the word?

You know,

the moment someone confronts him,

he lashes out.

He always has.

You know, people always say that

you can't choose your parents,

but you can't choose

your children.

- (Knocking)

- (Freddie's voice) 'Dickie.'

(Dickie's voice) 'You can be

a leech. You can be quite boring.'

(Tom) 'Stop it!'

(Dickie) 'Boring, it's boring.'

- (Knocking)

- (Voices overlapping)

(Tom screams)

' Stop, stop, stop!

- 'Stop, stop, stop!'

- (Freddie) 'Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.'

(Dickie) 'Like a little girl.'

- 'Like a little girl.'

- (Knocking)

(Knocking)

- (Knocking)

- Coming.

- Sorry. I was asleep.

- Finally.

- I must have fallen asleep.

- Did Dickie's dad go?

You look ghastly, Tom.

Did you have a nightmare?

- He's having an early night.

- Oh, poor man.

You know, we were banging

on that door forever.

(Marge) Uh-oh.

- I think I've broken a strap.

- Not guilty.

- I'll fix some drinks.

- (Marge giggling)

Ah! You walk in Venice.

Are you okay?

I'm fine.

- Did you want me to stick around?

- No, it's okay.

I could come back.

Your key.

- (Knocking)

- (Marge) Tom?

Marge, I'm in the bath.

I won't be long.

Tom, I have to speak to you.

It's urgent.

Coming.

- I found Dickie's rings.

- What?

You have Dickie's rings.

I can explain.

Dickie promised me

he would never take off this ring.

- Let me put some clothes on...

- I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.

- I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.

- Marge, you're being hysterical.

He promised me, "I swear, I will

never take off this ring until we get..."

- Shut up!

- (Gasping)

I'm wet, Marge.

I've lost my towel.

And I'd really like

to put some clothes on.

Go and pour us both a drink.

Pour us a drink.

Marge?

Where are you going?

I wasn't snooping.

I just...

I was looking for a needle

and thread to mend my bra.

That scent you're wearing.

I bought that for you.

The thing about Dickie-

So many things.

That day when he was late

coming back from Rome,

I tried to tell you this.

He was with another girl.

I'm not talking about Meredith, either.

Another girl

that we met in a bar.

He couldn't be faithful

for five minutes.

So when he makes a promise,

it doesn't mean what it means

when you make a promise...

or I make a promise.

He has so many realities, Dickie,

and he believes them all.

He lies. He lies.

And that's his- Half the time

he doesn't even realize he's doing it.

And today,

I really started wondering

whether he may have killed Freddie.

He would get so crazy

if anybody would contradict him.

Well, you know that.

You know that.

You know that.

And that's the irony, Marge.

I loved you.

You may as well know, Marge.

I loved you.

I don't know, maybe it's grotesque

of me to say this now,

so just... write it on a piece

of paper or something...

and put it in your purse

for a rainy day.

"Tom loves me. Tom loves me."

- Why do you have Dickie's rings?

- I told you.

- He gave them to me.

- Why? When?

I feel as if you haven't been listening

to anything I've been saying to you.

I don't believe you.

I don't believe you.

- It's all true.

- I don't believe...

a single word you've said.

You're shivering, Marge.

Look at you.

Marge, can I hold you?

Will you let me hold you?

- (Screaming)

- Marge?

- Oh, Peter. Thank God you're here.

- What's going on?

Get me out of here.

Get me out of here. Please!

- (Peter) Tom, are you okay?

- (Marge sobbing)

You try.

You try talking to her.

- (Peter) Tom?

- I give up.

Tell me what's going on. Tom!

- (Tom) What did I ever do to her?

- Listen-

Have her tell you one thing

that I've ever done to her.

You can't be angry with her.

She's confused,

and she needs someone to blame.

So she blames you.

I'll go back home

and talk to her.

As for you,

either get a safety razor

or grow a beard.

(Knocking)

- Is Mr Greenleaf here?

- Mr Ripley?

- Yes.

- I'm Alvin MacCarron.

(Marge) I don't know,

I don't know. I just know it.

(Mr Greenleaf) Marge, there's female

intuition and then there are facts.

- Tom.

- Sir.

Marge, you should have waited.

I didn't...

Didn't Peter say I'd come by

and pick you up?

Marge has been telling us

about the rings.

Yes, I feel ridiculous

I didn't mention them yesterday.

I clean forgot. Ridiculous.

Perhaps you didn't mention them because

there's only one conclusion to be drawn.

I'm going to take Marge

for a little walk, Tom.

Mr MacCarron needs to talk to you.

- We could go to the bar...

- No, no.

I think you should stay here.

(Door closing)

I could probably see

my room from here.

I can see my house.

When you see where you live from

a distance, it's like a dream, isn't it?

I don't care for BS.

I don't care to hear it.

I don't care to speak it.

- Okay.

- Did you know that at Princeton...

Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?

At a party over some girl.

Kicked the kid several times

in the head, put him in the hospital.

Boy had a wire fixed in his jaw,

lost some hearing.

Why do you think Dickie's father

sent him to Europe in the first place?

The Rome police didn't think

to ask Mr Greenleaf.

Nor did they think to check

on whether a Thomas Ripley...

had ever been a student

at Princeton University.

Oh, I turned up a Tom Ripley...

who had been a piano tuner

in the music department.

You see, in America,

we are taught to check a fact

before it becomes a fact.

We're taught to nose around.

When a girl drowns herself,

find out if that girl is pregnant.

Find out if Dickie had

an embarrassment there.

Mr Greenleaf appreciates

your loyalty. He really does.

Marge...

She has a hundred theories.

There are a few things

that she doesn't know.

We hope she never knows.

I hope she never knows.

Three different people...

saw Dickie get into Freddie's car.

One man,

who will not testify...

because he was jumping

somebody else's wife at the time,

saw Dickie removing licence plates

from a red sports car.

The police know about this man

because he happens to be a policeman.

I found these in the basement

of Dickie's apartment.

They belong to Freddie's car.

Mr Greenleaf has asked me...

to lose these in the canal

this evening.

(Bell tolling)

Mr Greenleaf feels that

there was a silent promise...

in Dickie's letter to you

which he intends to honour.

He also intends to transfer a portion

of Dickie's income from his trust...

into your name.

He does not intend...

to give the Italians

any information about Dickie's past.

He's rather hoping that...

you will feel the same.

- Thank you so much, Tom.

- Sir.

Goodbye.

Marge, I feel I never should have said

those things to you the other evening.

I was pretty flustered, and the rings-

And you looked so-

I don't know.

But I hope that note goes

in your purse to New York...

for a rainy day.

- What are you gonna do now, Tom?

- I don't know.

Peter has a concert in Athens

next month,

so he asked me

to come along and help out.

He says goodbye.

By the way, he was in rehearsal

so he couldn't-

Why do I think there's

never been a Ripley rainy day?

What?

I know it was you.

I know it was you.

- I know it was you! I know it was you!

- Marge!

- Marge, Marge. Please!

- I know you killed Dickie!

- Marge!

- I know! No!

(Sobbing)

I know it was you!

Marge. Marge, please.

It's not Tom. Really.

(Tom and Peter)

We are called gondoleri

But that's a vagary

It's quite honorary

The trade that we ply 

Ask me what I want to change

about this moment.

I don't know. What do you want

to change about this moment?

Nothing.

(Peter)

I'm freezing. Coming down?

Later. I want to catch the sunset.

- You're mad. (Chuckling)

- I am.

(Meredith) Dickie?

Dickie?

Dickie!

(Italian)

Oh, my God.

Hello, Meredith.

I was looking at you.

Your clothes.

I wouldn't have known you.

Well, you spotted me,

so you get the reward.

- What?

- Just kidding.

- Are you alone?

- Oh.

Hardly.

Couldn't be less alone.

- Aunt Joan.

- And "co."

A lot of "co."

Oh, God.

You know, seeing you again, I...

I've thought about you...

so much.

And I've thought about you.

Yeah, well, when I've thought

about you, I was mostly hating you.

Where have you been hiding?

I haven't been hiding.

I've been in police custody.

They've been trying

to flush out Freddie's killer.

- You're kidding.

- Well, they're giving me this vacation,

which is why the get-up.

Which is why

you haven't heard from me.

You know, the whole world

thinks you killed Freddie.

- Oh! It's terrible.

- I know.

Listen, I can't talk now.

Um, later?

Later? Later?

So...

(Laughs)

Are you travelling under "R"?

(Laughs)

You know what? I am.

(Laughing)

Dickie, are you with

Peter Smith-Kingsley? I bet you are.

My aunt thought she saw him.

Peter Smith-Kingsley?

No, I...

I haven't seen him in months.

No, I'm alone.

(Knocking at door)

Hi.

- How was it?

- It was good.

But I'll tell you something.

I want us to stay in here

for the rest of the trip.

(Chuckles)

Was that Meredith?

Was who Meredith?

Meredith Logue. You were kissing

someone. It looked like Meredith.

I came out to find you.

Oh, hardly kissing.

- Kissing off.

- It didn't look that way.

You know? From a distance?

I lied... to her.

She thought she'd seen you.

Why lie?

Dickie and Peter together.

That's just too good gossip.

Or Tom and Peter, even.

That would be

even better gossip.

Really? Why?

(Sighing)

I, um- (Sighing)

I'm completely lost.

I know.

I'm sorry, Peter.

I'm lost.

I'm gonna be stuck

in the basement, aren't I?

Aren't I?

That's my-

Terrible...

and alone...

and dark.

(Chuckles)

And I've lied...

about who I am...

and where I am.

Now no one'll ever find me.

(Chuckling)

What do you mean,

lied about who you are?

I always thought

it'd be better...

to be a fake somebody...

than a real nobody.

What are you talking about?

You're not a nobody.

That's the last thing you are.

Peter. (Sighing)

Tell me some good things

about Tom Ripley.

No, don't get up.

Don't get up. Don't get up.

Just-

Just tell me some nice things...

about Tom Ripley.

(Chuckling)

"Good things about Tom Ripley."

That could take me some time.

Tom is talented.

Tom is tender.

Tom is beautiful.

(Crying and chuckling)

You're such a liar.

Tom is-

Tom is a mystery.

(Peter) 'Tom is not a nobody.

'Tom has secrets

he doesn't want to tell me,

'and I wish he would.

'Tom has nightmares.

'That's not a good thing.

'Tom has someone to love him.

'That is a good thing.

'Mmm. (Chuckling)

Tom is crushing me.

(Whispering) 'Tom is crushing me.'

- (Tom sobbing)

- 'Tom. Tom, you're crush-'

- (Peter gagging)

- (Tom sobs) 'Oh, God!

'Oh, God!'

- (Gagging continues)

- 'Oh, God!'

(Sobbing continues)

'Oh, God! Peter.'

You don't know

What love is

Until you know the meaning

of the blues

#Till you love the love

You had to lose

You don't know

What love is

You don't know how lips hurt

Until you've kissed

And had to pay the cost

Until you've flipped your heart

And found you've lost

You don't know what love is

You know

How a lost heart feels

The very thought of reminiscing

And how those lips

With a taste for tears

Soon lose their taste

For kissing

You don't know

How hearts burn

A love that cannot live

But never dies

Until you've reached dawn

With sleepless eyes

You don't know

What love is

You don't know

What love is

And don't know

What love is

You don't know

What love is 

# It's only the end of the world

It's only the end of the world

Somewhere, a while ago already

Sir?

Excuse me, sir?

Your seatbelt, please.

Oh, sorry.

God, I'm so sorry.

There I was, after 10 years- well, 12, to be precise...

So, after twelve years of absence and in spite of my fear,

I was going to visit them.

In life there are a number of motivations that are no one's business, that force you to leave, without looking back.

And there are just as many motivations that force you to return.

So after all those years,

I decided to retrace my steps.

Take the journey... to announce my death.

Announce it in person, and try to give the others, and myself, one last time, the illusion that I am, until its very end, the master of my life.

Let's see how that goes.

IT'S ONLY THE END OF THE WORLD

Mom! Tony! He's here!

- That twat took a cab!

- Shit, I'm not ready.

You could've done that before!

Before! That's rich!

I was mixing baba ganoush while you primped.

You've been spiffing up for hours!

Suzanne, stop! A mother can smarten up for her son.

Louis loves fashion and color.

All gay men do!

- That explains the tranny look!

- Tranny? Thanks.

I don't want to fight, he's almost here!

You always want the last word!

Think I'll give it to you?

I don't care.

Exactly! "I don't care,

I don't care."

That's Missy's motto!

The cab must've cost you an arm.

I said I'd pick you up.

Louis! Love the hair!

I can't see, but looks nice.

The cab must've cost you a pretty penny!

I just said that!

Louis, you don't know Catherine.

No.

Catherine, Louis.

Louis, Catherine.

- Hi, Catherine.

- Hi.

You must be crazy hot. Gimme that.

Let him come inside!

She's happy.

- She's wagging like a poodle.

- Antoine!

I'm coming, Louis!

Stupid nail polish.

Hair dryer won't dry!

I'm delighted, Catherine.

Of course... I mean, me course...

Uh, me too.

I'm delighted too. Oh God!

You shake hands?

Like you're presidents?

Or strangers?

They are strangers!

She didn't know.

Give her a kiss, Louis.

Suzanne's right, kisses.

Charmed.

Charmed? Why the heck "charmed"?

They've never met!

They've never met, Mom!

Stop screaming, crazy!

Never?

Why no, he wasn't there.

You're batshit crazy!

I forgot, that's all.

I didn't realize...

Well, darn it!

We sure do live in strange times.

Sweetie!

No.

Louis.

You hate "sweetie."

- You knew they'd never met.

- He wasn't at the wedding.

He couldn't make it.

Remember, Martine?

I know, darling, but it slipped my mind.

Since then there's been no occasion...

Catherine, she just wants attention.

Shut it, will you.

A bummer about the cab.

I'd have picked you up.

I got a car now.

I said he'd do that, Mom.

- How was the journey?

- I told you last night.

I don't remember.

- But I told you.

- Suzanne, who gives a shit?

Antoine!

So you travelled safe?

Yes. But I wouldn't call it travelling.

Well, then...

Let's.

See, Catherine, like I said.

That's Louis.

Kisses only Mom, not even his brother...

Drop it, will you?

Am I talking to you? Fuck off!

Antoine!

They're with their other grandmother. My mom.

Of course.

We had no way of knowing.

It was so...

She was expecting them.

She'd have made a scene...

But they'd have loved to see you.

And me too. I mean...

Antoine and I would've liked you to meet them.

That's our oldest, she's 8.

Everyone says she looks just like Antoine.

His spitting image.

But we say that of all children, right? True or not.

- We do.

- Don't we?

Alrighty! Appetizers in the living room, I guess?

Cold cuts from Célestin's and chorizo for Louis...

- Still a fan?

- Yes.

She's got her dad's temper!

A stubborn little devil!

An Antoinette.

Lucky us.

Louis, you had send me a note... sent! - sorry, sent me a note, and flowers.

God were they pretty!

I was really, really happy!

I sure liked them.

And I, well...

Antoine and I had sent you a photo of her, and...

It was ridiculous. Well...

She fit in Antoine's hand.

She was so tiny.

A teeny-tiny baby.

Remember, Antoine?

No. I love forgetting the most important things in my life.

Yeah.

Actually, on this photo, the resemblance to Antoine...

Zero.

Zero, really.

Big, big fat zero.

But we don't look like anyone at that age.

Anyway, she's grown up.

Don't you think you're boring him with that?

You think so?

Not at all!

Why?

Catherine, no.

No but...

That's my thing.

I bore everybody with my kids.

You think kids interest people.

But guess what? Nope.

No, Catherine.

I don't know why he said that.

Why'd you say that?

It's mean. Well, unpleasant.

Yeah, Antoine. Be fucking decent.

Like that dress?

"Nightmare in Tokyo"?

Beats that jacket and the "clueless dick" kit.

What about that paint on your face?

- Fuck you!

- Enough, kids!

He started it.

Louis?

I'm not bored, Catherine.

I love hearing about your kids.

I'm glad.

And, um...

Don't you have a boy who has my name?

Yes.

Yes. Sorry, yes.

I'm happy. I'm touched.

I mean, it touched me.

Six years old now...

Six. They're two years apart, and...

I don't know if I should keep going or...

Hey whoa, whoa! Don't blame me.

If you want to talk, talk.

Don't make me sound like a bully muzzling you.

You're nuts, Antoine.

You're nuts.

Tell him, please.

He's all ears.

Go ahead.

He loves it. Our children, the children of the world...

He's so fond of this topic!

The evolution of our offspring.

His favorite conversation.

So tell him!

Chill the fuck out, Tony.

Oh God, okay, sorry.

I shouldn't have.

I didn't mean to...

I'm sorry, darling. Go on.

I'm embarrassed. Sorry, Catherine.

No offense, Antoine...

You're making me uncomfortable.

I'm so sorry, really!

Big Bad Antoine spoiled the lovely day!

Shut up and let her talk!

Go on, Catherine.

Ignore him.

Yeah, ignore me!

There's my dip and then jalapegno... Peno ?

Peño.

Anyhow, spicy.

And fry sauce of course.

Catherine, do tell.

No but...

That's it, he just...

He has your name, sir.

I mean, Louis.

And, um...

What I think is interesting is that, first and foremost, he has, if we go back, your father's name, and so, needless to say...

Here we go, French kings...

Look, Antoine,

I'll just shut up, alright?

And you tell the story.

Or no one does, and...

We just sit here choking on fry sauce!

Choking on my dip, little did I know.

- Martine, I meant...

- Express yourself, doll.

I was kidding, sweetheart.

Tell Louis the story. Tell him.

He's got your father's name.

And I...

Well, we thought it'd be great.

- In my family...

- Oh, it's you, hon!

Well, there's a tradition by which the parents' first name, or the first name of the baby's grandfather...

Basically, the first son's name and the grandfather's name are... identical.

I told Lori you're here. She said,

"Must be a cold day in hell!"

Dumb as ever, that one.

So, Antoine's the eldest, but Antoine, to me, was a no.

And Louis was a yes.

Antoine didn't want an Antoine, said it'd be bad luck.

Since you people don't have kids, we weren't depriving you of anything.

But...

I mean, we say that, but of course you can... have children.

Everything's possible nowadays.

You'll have some, I'm sure.

You're still young and...

Would you have named him Louis?

You still can. Right, Antoine?

Mm-hmm.

Okay, Catherine, I need a hand.

- Are you hungry?

- Getting there.

Me too.

Louis, wanna see my room?

Sure.

- What do I do? Jerk off?

- Come hold my pots!

Antoine?

- Antoine, d'you hear?

- Yeah!

Jesus Christ!

I hardly remember you.

I was young and...

I have zero memories.

Only what people told me.

Anyway, I'm just...

Just rambling.

It sucks that you left.

Sucks, uh... for me, for her,

Antoine.

For you too, right?

You don't have to answer.

But maybe you regret it too?

Maybe you needed us?

I... I'm sorry.

That's why I'm here.

Partly.

It's funny, 'cause before

I got your postcard or letter,

I'd say to myself that... we were due, y'know.

That the time was right.

- Yeah.

- And... whenever...

I'm the one who gets the mail.

And whenever I see a postcard in the pile,

I try to put it picture side up.

That way, I have something to turn over. To discover.

Something I'm hoping for.

It's funny 'cause... we're all following you, reading articles, doing all that stuff and...

You know, you can't not know that... we feel, I mean...

We all feel a sort of... admiration.

For you.

Sounds silly, but...

It's a gift.

You have a gift.

You're laughing?

Yeah, I...

Why? It's a gift, that's it.

It's not funny.

I'm complimenting you.

You got a gift.

You're lucky.

Yeah 'cause...

You don't really use it with us.

It's for others.

Or maybe for no one.

I don't know you.

I'm just saying that.

I'm not judging.

Those are facts.

I'm thinking out loud.

Fucking kills me. I'm so itchy.

What?

I dunno, the makeup.

I never use it, so it itches.

I just wanted... I dunno.

Know what I mean?

And Mom's makeup is shit.

It's red and gross, so I bought this stuff.

Don't you wanna sit down?

It's cozy.

I'm good.

Those are all mine.

We just call them your "elliptic bits."

Maybe "elliptic" is wrong.

No.

I mean...

I get it.

We each have our collection.

Antoine.

Mom, obviously.

And she's right.

You've never forgotten the... our birthdays.

The important days of our lives.

Always a postcard, always something.

Anyway, I dunno.

I've stopped complaining 'cause...

She lectures us when we dare say you're... not around.

"He does what he has to do.

He always has."

She says that?

Of course. I didn't make it up.

But don't worry, I'm an adult, I...

No problem.

No problemo.

No!

No problemo.

Dunno why I said that.

I hate that.

It's not me.

I hate that expression, it's ridiculous.

So what is "you"?

It's weird how you always send postcards, as if you're on vacation, and mailmen can see what you write.

I dunno.

Do you let everyone see the important things you write?

Well, what you write isn't...

Okay, this is just...

Pathetic. I'm pathetic.

Everyone says so.

Sorry.

I didn't mean to...

I'm sorry, Suzanne.

No, it's me.

I'm sorry.

Friggin' heat wave is driving us crazy.

And here it's worse.

Everything's worse here.

I wanted to leave but, I dunno...

I'm good here.

Got the basement, my room, the storage.

That's the room behind you.

Shit from the old house.

Yours, mostly.

Mom's gonna ask if you want any of it.

Bet you don't.

Louis?

Are you listening?

Yeah, stuff you bought yourself.

Did you buy the car?

Antoine's old one.

Mom bought it.

Mom doesn't drive.

Mm-hmm, so guess who's her slave driver?

But I can drive downtown, see the girls.

And I drive Mom for errands.

We don't depend on anyone.

We bother no one.

And I like those little moments with Mom.

She's fun.

She's nuts, though.

Anyway...

No.

I knew you'd say no.

Smoking isn't very you.

Are you completely high?

No.

I hardly feel it anymore.

In fact, it might do me good.

- I don't usually smoke, but...

- So?

Why you here?

Got someone to introduce?

Are you pregnant?

For you. For, uh...

I don't know.

I'd love to see our old house.

Why?

Why do you wanna go back to that ugly place?

I don't know. Out of nostalgia.

Is it for a play?

No.

No.

Suzanne! Louis! Are you coming?

Stop screaming!

Well, get the hell up!

Check out the storage room if you want.

And your old stuff.

Out of nostalgia.

Reminds me of our Sundays!

- Ugh! Please!

- What?

She knows about Sundays.

Be honest, say it!

Let her talk, Antoine.

He's embarrassed.

His Majesty longed for adventure!

That's why he went to China after college.

- You went to China?

- So?

So, I was working, my husband was working...

Bottom line, we both worked.

There you are, sweetie!

It's story time. Lucky you!

- Our Sundays?

- Ha! See?

Even Louis, Mom!

Let us be, Antoine.

Louis, red?

Louis's always white, dear.

- White, please.

- Only our family did that!

It was a family thing.

Our thing! Mine, too.

It was a tradition.

Do you need a hand?

Nah, calms me, just getting ahead.

I wanna tell my story!

Go on, let's get it over with.

Sunday was our day off.

So we went out for a ride.

Systematically.

Systematically!

It was like... a ritual.

What are you doing?

Nothing. I'm listening.

Stay, Antoine.

Forget him. Listen to me.

He loves to upset me.

So, we'd go on an outing.

And we'd take the car.

Their dad always owned a car.

Here, back then, owning a car...

But he worked.

It was his car.

It was old, ugly and noisy, but it was his.

Sunday mornings, he washed it.

Washed the hell out of it.

And after lunch...

Hop! Off we went.

Every Sunday! A tradition.

No vacations, but every Sunday, come shine or rain...

No! "Come rain or shine, hell or high water."

Rain or shine, hell or high water.

You're right!

He had expressions like that for every situation in life.

- He did?

- Yes.

"He did?" You shitting me?

You know all this!

Why tell stories we already know?

We do that in life, stop being so stiff!

We recall and relive the things we love.

I know she knows, but I enjoy telling her again.

That's why we remember! For me!

Happy?

If you hate it so much, cover your ears, beat it and stop cheesing us off!

Cheese off?

Damn right! Means piss off!

Your brother's specialty.

So, the first Sunday in May, or after March 8th...

My birthday, of course.

Or if the 8th was a Sunday we hit the jackpot!

That was the real deal.

We'd drive an hour or two.

Fields, forests, castles, vineyards, sometimes.

We'd stroll, eat on the grass, take a nap...

On the plaid blanket.

Tuna salad, rice, mayo, deviled eggs.

Antoine still loves that salad, right?

Always says "Make your salad!"

He's sulking.

And then, uh...

Night came, and we'd be weary from the drive, and we'd walk in and say,

"Home, sweet home!"

Proof that all those fancy trips to the beach, airports, planes, sassy attendants...

Anyway...

Then, well, the boys got older and...

Well, Suzanne arrived!

The boys had their bikes, went their separate ways.

And we stopped the Sunday outings, `cause, with only Suzanne, it wasn't worth it.

Our fault, again.

Or mine, Antoine.

Heavens!

Suzanne, I don't believe it!

Yeah, drop it, Mom!

But...

I'm gonna kill myself!

That's our day?

Dumb memories and shit music?

- Fucking hell!

- It's our song, Suzanne.

- Drop it, Mom! Jeez!

- Our aerobics song!

- We're taking off.

- Suzanne, come!

You outta your mind?

You do aerobics?

Piss your pants!

I adore this song.

Suzanne, come!

I'm obsessed, it's a real find!

Everybody found it, Mom!

- You just live in a parallel world.

- I googled it.

Translation said it's about

Picasso being in love, or Picasso...

Anyway, it wasn't clear.

Come on, now!

No!

Make it a perfect day, impress your brother!

Don't embarrass her!

Suzanne, please!

Suzanne, come on!

Come show them!

All your moves are wrong, it's a disaster.

Well then come.

Show your poor old mom how to do it.

Alright, one, two...

God, Mom, you're terrible!

Looks like you're having a stroke.

Mom, focus instead of hitting on the teacher!

In his dreams, maybe!

Yes?

Where are you, why does it say unknown?

Oh, right.

Not yet, no.

I've been here for an hour,

I can't just... shove it in their face.

It was tough with my sister.

I don't know her.

She's so pretty.

And so much older. It's nuts.

The others too.

And I am too, of course.

I don't see myself.

I don't know, after lunch maybe.

Over coffee and dessert.

I don't know.

When the moment is right.

I don't think I'll stay after telling them.

I don't know how they'll react.

Maybe they won't even cry.

Listen, this isn't the time.

I'll call you later.

Yeah.

I'm scared.

I'm scared of them.

Okay. Alright.

Me too. Ciao.

Sorry.

Sorry.

No, it's... Excuse me, sorry.

Are you alright?

- Uh... me?

- Yes, you.

Yes. Why?

I don't know.

You haven't said much since earlier.

No, that's just...

That's me.

I'm fine.

What do you want me to say?

Nothing.

I'm sorry about earlier, in there.

Antoine saying your kids don't interest me.

No idea why he said that.

He loves to think

I'm not interested.

I assume he must've... tried to turn you against me.

Anyway, I'm sorry about that.

I'd already forgotten about it.

I...

I'm used to it.

But why would you say... that he tried to turn me against you?

Just a thought.

I know Antoine.

You do?

Sorry, I'm...

It's weird you'd say that, 'cause... he... doesn't talk about you... often...

Almost never, actually.

And when he does...

No.

I didn't mean to judge.

You're right.

He thinks that... you don't care about his life.

Or him, me, the kids, his job and all.

D'you know what he does?

For a living?

Do you know his...

I'm not criticizing...

Really, don't take it as...

- I'm not criticizing.

- No.

But... do you know his job?

He makes tools.

In a small shop, not from here.

And, even myself, I don't... know, exactly.

But anyway, he... thinks his life doesn't interest you.

So, he... Well, that is...

He believes, I think, that what he does, uh... is... unlikely to interest you.

And I think he probably isn't... entirely mistaken.

Unless I'm wrong.

I might be wrong.

Maybe you are.

But today I was hoping...

No, no, no.

Wait...

Don't tell me.

Alright? Please.

I'd prefer you to tell him.

Alright.

If you tell me, it won't change anything.

It isn't my role. Alright?

I wasn't actually saying anything, Catherine.

- We're talking.

- Yes, but...

I'm not good at talking.

And they...

They're... waiting for this.

- See you in a bit?

- Yes.

- You're coming?

- Yeah.

Louis.

C'mere!

Shut the door.

Antoine will see me.

He'll rag on me, again.

I'm at 3 per day, max, so...

I quit quitting.

I felt too dumb.

Hanging in there?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Three words.

Same old, right.

Always these... two or three-word answers.

Like on your postcards.

Or that little smile.

Stop it.

Did they talk to you?

Suzanne just did, right?

They have things to say, of course.

They'll make the most of it.

They don't know when they'll have another chance.

Suzanne...

She's clueless, poor girl.

She doesn't know you.

Doesn't know much.

She's pictured you from what she's heard.

And Antoine...

You know him.

"My way, or no way."

Problem is...

Well...

We're afraid of time.

The time you give us.

And I don't... pretend to think you'll stay long...

And that's fine.

But now you're here.

So...

Forgive them.

Forgive, because... they'll be...

What's the word?

Abrupt?

Or clumsy.

It doesn't matter.

God, I can see them!

Asking things, and you...

Three words, a little smile...

You being you.

Poor them.

What if I don't only have words to answer?

What if I have words to say?

Lucky us!

I'm kidding.

But it won't be enough.

For Suzanne, until next time.

I won't even ask when.

And Antoine, well...

He'll be more bitter about you, even more lost.

Suzanne wants to leave.

She told you.

Go and live her life some place.

Far away, of course.

Antoine... he'd like more freedom.

I can feel it.

Not to owe anything.

To whom?

Everyone, I guess.

Me, above all.

And Suzanne, too.

They want to confide this in you, Louis!

They need your approval.

You never took responsibility, and I'm not asking you to.

I'm not the eldest, Martine.

I'm not the surrogate father...

Cut the crap, Louis!

Don't play dumb.

Use your head a bit.

Age has nothing to do with it.

Doesn't make you the man of the house.

I was, as a child!

Status, salary, luck, beauty, gifts, courage!

The things you're born with, or without!

Should I keep going?

Who's the writer, here?

I know you won't come back.

Encourage them.

No one ever did.

I did, but I don't count, my words don't matter.

Encourage them, Louis.

Give them your permission to do this, or that.

Tell Suzanne, even if it's just hot air, an empty promise,

"Suzanne, why don't you come visit me?"

Tell her she can.

That she has the right.

You're still in the homo ghetto?

Yes or no?

No. I've moved.

What?

I still write there, dummy!

Someone picks up the mail for me.

Don't worry. I like it that way.

You like your mother not knowing where you live?

Holy shit.

That's funny.

I mean...

You're funny.

You still don't get it.

Think we don't love you?

Or understand you?

You're right.

I don't understand you.

But I love you.

I love you.

No one will take that away from me.

Write that one down, for one of your plays.

Why are you here?

You can tell your mother.

You thought, "Heck!

It's been 12 years!

Let's grab a bite on the patio!"

Well, you look great, I'm glad.

Damn it!

Where's that thingy?

How old are you now?

Me?

No, the watering can!

Saint-Anthony came around.

For the kisses, for Antoine, for the food, and for me.

Here.

Tell me if I should get it.

As a Christmas gift.

To me, from me.

I'm 34.

Oh, my...

It's been 34 years for me too, then.

Is that a long time?

I can't tell anymore.

Look, just do what you have to do, Louis.

Gosh, that's crazy.

I just...

I wish I could take a photo, you've got... your father's eyes, right here, right now.

Well, anywho...

There's no need for tears or declarations today.

I was saying that... for the future.

Gotta think about it!

But the day should end as it started, without obligations, without intention.

And well, quite simply...

Just... well.

Of course.

That idiot called her hens Denise.

She's mentally challenged.

I walk in the hen house, hens running everywhere.

I go "Look at your cute hens!"

"What did you name 'em?"

"I named 'em Denise!"

So I go "That's pretty.

Which one is Denise?"

She goes "They're all named Denise!"

I called all of them Denise.

Will I go to hell if I love that story?

Why hell?

Well, she's got Down's syndrome.

Whatever syndrome, a hell of a big one.

Down, Up, Wide... She's got it.

Someone could've told her,,

"Don't call them all Denise."

I don't like it much.

I don't like it...

I find it mean, and unseemly.

It's funny, c'mon!

St. Catherine's among us.

- You alright?

- Yeah.

Why?

I dunno. You wanna...

Do something else, go for a walk, or...

- play games.

- You and your fucking games.

Get off my friggin' back!

I don't know about games but, actually, I would've loved...

- Well...

- What? The old house?

- Yes.

- What?

He wants to see the old house.

I don't mind.

I can drive you.

Why d'you wanna go there?

Are you daft?

He's not daft, let him be.

- You're daft!

- You're stupid!

But Louis, really, why d'you want to go there?

Did you forget something in your room?

No.

I don't know, I just do.

I'm curious to... see the surroundings, how they've evolved...

How time has modified or... wrecked them.

It's not even for sale.

You can't visit it.

I drove by last week, and... it's completely abandoned.

You wanna go back to that shithole, to see how time has wrecked, modified it.

Is that the most la-di-da shit plan you got?

Antoine.

I meant no offense but...

Of course not.

It took us 20 years to get outta there, and you want to go see if the wind has wafted the autumn leaves onto the rusted roof?

What the fuck? Who cares?

Leave him alone, he just wants to go for a ride.

I mean...

I'll come with you,

Louis, if you want.

Doesn't matter.

- It was a bad idea.

- No shit!

I'll beat off in Auschwitz, jizz out a poem!

Antoine! Bad taste!

Alrighty, Louis!

Give us some gossip!

Let's dish!

I don't know any.

Well, make it up!

You know, showbiz gossip!

Who screwed who, who was screwed.

Your fingers stink.

You smoked?

Wine, Louis?

- No thanks.

- You smoked.

I don't know any gossip.

I don't go out.

Coffee, Mr. Louis?

I was going to make a pot.

What century d'you

Misses and Misters live in?

What's it to you, dumbass?

For fuck's sake, am I talking to you?

Stop fucking picking on me, telling me to shut up.

Telling me I'm stupid.

Stay the fuck outta this.

Kids, no. Not this.

Do you hear that?

What's that tone?

It's well deserved.

- You never talk to me like that.

- I'm starting!

That's my tone when you fucking annoy me!

Never mind, I got it.

That's too cute!

You're a cutie pie...

Aren't you?

Wanna look cool in front of your bro? 'Cause he's here?

This is for you, Louis.

Is it working?

Are you impressed, Loulou?

Rou-lou-cou-lou-lou!

Loulou! Yoohoo!

This is a load of bullshit.

It's bullshit. Mom!

Suzanne, the neighbors!

You make no sense!

This isn't about Louis!

Why d'you always humiliate me?

Humiliate everyone!

This day fucking sucks!

Suzanne, come back!

Gosh, and you just let her go!

She'll be back.

Lord. Such a shame.

Catherine, I'd fancy a cup of coffee.

"Catherine, I'd fancy a cup of coffee."

Antoine.

What? Antoine, Antoine!

Yes, Antoine! What?

That's my goddamn name, yeah!

All day long!

Fucking pain in the ass!

Fine.

I'll work on my timing!

I was about to say it's lovely being together.

Later, maybe.

Excuse me, Catherine.

No worries.

We're not complete boors.

What's wrong with you?

Why are you being so hostile?

Louis?

- Sorry.

- Sorry!

I'm... Martine's asking for you.

Dessert will be ready in 30 or 40.

Would that be alright?

I'll be right up.

Alright.

Sorry.

How much time?

How much time what?

How much time...

Will you, um...

Antoine's alone upstairs and...

You could talk to him.

I'm coming.

So, um...

I need a smoke.

Gotta buy smokes.

Well, you can... Never mind.

Yeah, I know.

Don't rat out Mom,

I hate her fancy cigs.

I never smoke but when I smoke...

I smoke.

- And you need to smoke, right now.

- Mm-hmm.

You coming? If you want, in the car, we could...

What?

- Talk?

- No. I mean... I guess, yeah.

Yeah.

- I need some fresh air.

- Well, then.

Done.

I actually flew in early.

Traveled overnight.

I wanted to see the sunrise at the airport, eat at the small café.

Thought I'd come for breakfast, but...

I waited for the proper moment.

You're telling me this... because?

What should I say?

Anything specific?

No. I don't know, just wanted you to know.

It's not important.

I told you 'cause it's true.

I wanted to tell you.

Listen...

Don't start, okay?

Don't start what?

This, Louis. This.

Don't smother me with airport stories...

Should've come earlier, later...

I drown in that crap.

Not in the mood.

So you traveled last night?

How was it?

Come on!

It went fine, I guess.

It's a short trip.

You guys think I live on another planet.

Coming here's not the end of the world.

But if you don't want to talk, it's fine.

Please!

I'm listening, alright?

Go on, tell me.

I want you to. Come on!

I want to know.

The airport, the café.

The heat's driving us nuts, okay?

No, you're right.

It's irrelevant.

I just thought that...

I don't know.

You'd be happy... or glad.

To know that, this morning

I was at the airport café.

Remember the café?

Waiting.

I couldn't show up at dawn and scare them.

I can see Suzanne on the porch, with a shotgun.

She's such a pothead.

She'd grab it upside down, blow a hole in her head!

You done?

I was waiting, thus I said to myself...

Thus?

Thus!

Thus!

- Thus...

- I was waiting, and...

I thought I'd tell you about this.

About being there, doing nothing.

Thought you'd get it.

So I'm telling you.

Only you, not them.

They'd be upset that we could've spent more time together.

Hanging out there felt good.

- You know how...

- See, that's just... That's it!

This is exactly what I meant. This.

That crap I have to listen to.

What's true, what's not...

I knew it, I'm not dumb.

I didn't forget that.

Your endless stories, and words, words, words, to confuse us, and fuck us over!

You get away with it, and I'm lost!

- You're sick, Antoine.

- I'm sick now? No, you're sick!

I know your little story!

The airport, the café...

And what else? All those details...

A dude cooking fries, your clothes soaking up the smell of grease...

And you were alone, all alone in the airport, weren't you?

You could hear a pin drop.

So, you're there.

Reading your paper?

I bet you are!

Or some money magazine, with the shiny paper and the big red letters...

And I don't know either why you came, Louis.

No one knows. No one understands.

And you hate that,

'cause if we knew...

Oh, it'd be easy!

You'd have taken off already, or wouldn't have come!

But you think that matters?

Think airports, cafés, magazines matter to me?

You're wrong, buddy!

It doesn't matter at all!

It doesn't matter anymore!

That's not what you thought at the airport.

Or you weren't going to tell me.

You're saying that to fill the void between us.

Bam, I'm here!

So you're making shit up.

You made all that up to talk to me?

So I'd feel special.

Special?

To know you could've spent more time with us?

You didn't think that.

We're strangers.

Strangers share nothing.

We're strangers, Louis.

Haven't we always been?

You thought "I'll take that angle, so I can handle him."

You thought...

"I've studied, lived, written...

I can handle him."

Funny. People say that of me...

He's hard to handle.

"Handle Antoine with kid gloves!"

Like an animal in a cage.

That you pet. And kill.

That's what you did at the airport, Louis.

You thought you had a technique to grab me.

But I'm not in the mood.

I'm not interested.

What are you doing here?

I don't wanna know!

I don't care.

You're here, you're not.

That's your problem.

You're home. You come, you go, you stay. Fine.

Not everything's so great in your small life.

- `Cause it is small.

- Antoine, slow down.

You were at the airport café, thinking about sweet nothing!

The coffee's giving you the runs, you're thinking about no one!

You're there, living your fucking life, so get the fuck over it already!

- Antoine?

- No.

I don't wanna be here.

And listen to you. Or talk.

I'm scared. You happy?

You guys always have to tell me everything.

And I have to listen

I hate listening. I hate talking.

We think silent people are good listeners.

But I shut up so people leave me alone.

Do you get that?

Do you?

I do.

Amazing.

By the way...

Pierre died last week. Cancer.

Pierre?

Jolicoeur.

Pierre Jolicoeur, your Pierre.

I better help with dessert or they'll gimme hell.

Antoine, is that you?

Where is everyone?

- What?

- Where are the others?

I dunno.

Here.

Hold this while I...

I think I heard someone come in.

Shouldn't I go get everyone?

I think it was Antoine.

They'll come when they're ready.

Help me with this.

I don't get it.

What?

Think you're alone?

You're handsome when you smile.

You think we're alone?

Think Mom gets any of this?

No one gets it.

Never did, never will.

That's the beauty of it, right?

I think Antoine and Louis had a fight.

Get outta here.

Antoine!

Yeah, coming!

There was no drama...

I was young, I can't remember, but there was no drama... tragic stuff, or betrayals, or murders.

Shit like that...

So he'd avoid us.

He doesn't care.

He doesn't feel the need for "us".

He wants to be far.

He's almost farther sitting on our couch.

He's the sad one.

He missed all those years, never saw you grow.

And life went on, as it does today, invariably.

Just like in books.

You're unhappy, but only

'cause it's convenient.

- So choose to be happy.

- Easy to say.

Anyway, it's almost over.

Really? Why?

So...

Yep!

Appetizers, mains, finger food... Nope.

But desserts?

I'm just unbeatable.

I...

I've got something to tell you.

Things, actually.

I'll come back.

And more often.

And write.

More often.

Not just two or three words.

Because...

I regret it all.

The time we've wasted.

The time I've wasted.

Suzanne, if you want to visit, you're welcome.

For a weekend, or longer, as you wish. We'll set it...

And Antoine...

If we had dinner, we could continue the conversation we began, calmly.

When I'm back. Or you come.

I can't. Too much work.

A weekend?

Just a weekend.

Weekends are just as...

Everyone can survive a weekend, Antoine.

You can. You have the right to.

- You love the city.

- I love the city, now?

You always did.

Truth is, I have to go.

- What are you doing?

- What's wrong?

When all is well,

Antoine messes things up!

Or are you tidying up?

Don't hold your breath.

What's wrong with you two?

Are you drunk? Or high?

You guys got high?

He's used to it.

I'll drive you. No more cabs.

- What?

- Here.

Already, now?

Didn't he say that?

No.

Louis, you're staying tonight?

My bad! In the car, didn't you say you had a meeting tonight?

Tonight, right?

Are you insane, Antoine?

I'm not insane, I listen.

He has to go, so I kindly offer my help.

Airport's 40 minutes from your mom's, right?

That's right, honey.

I'll grab the kids on my way.

Excuse me, how long to the airport? 40 minutes?

When d'you last go?

You've never been!

I go all the time, idiot,

Julien lives there!

So? What's the difference?

He's not taking another cab!

That isn't the point, Antoine!

It is not the point!

Louis...

You're going?

I can drive you, tonight, or tomorrow.

You sleep over, we have breakfast.

What's that meeting?

Yes, what's that meeting?

Is it that important?

It can't wait?

On a Sunday, I mean...

You said it was crucial.

Shut up!

What's the problem, here?

We were doing fine!

In a moment, pow!

Why, Louis?

Why?

Because.

I have a meeting.

Thank you. Let's go.

What the fuck, Antoine!

Don't touch him!

What's wrong?

- Antoine, I'm fine!

- Just helping...

What the hell's going on!

This is pure madness!

No! He'll miss his plane.

- We can at least kiss goodbye.

- Now! Kiss kiss, chop chop!

Only two seconds ago we were... eating nicely, speaking happily, sharing a moment and you just act up, breaking, spoiling every bit of it!

I'm warning you,

I won't forget this.

Your brother was trying...

I don't get it.

- It's okay, Mom.

- Kissy, kissy, come on!

- Antoine...

- Shut up!

Jesus! I'll drive him!

Louis, let me take you!

Suzanne, stop!

I'm driving him!

- We can't drive like a...

- Like what? Say it!

I'm driving him! The end!

I'll be back in an hour.

- You're so despicable!

- Me?

You don't hear yourself!

See yourself!

How you rush him!

How you talk to me!

And your wife!

You... you little piece of shit.

- Come on, defend me!

- Of course she will!

Suzanne?

I don't get it.

So I'll come visit?

Let's go, Louis.

Louis!

See you soon.

Let him go, you fucking psycho!

What did I do?

What you do is, you ruin our fucking lives and our day with Louis with your brutality!

Brutality? My... Me?

Yes, you!

- Antoine.

- Stop, I'm fine!

Calm down.

It's okay, just...

Calm us... Calm yourself.

Don't be so brutal.

Who's brutal? I'm trying to help!

You weren't brutal, it's a misunder...

- You! Goodness incarnate...

- Brutal and stupid!

You understand shit!

You know shit!

So shut your mouth, bitch!

Don't ever talk to your sister like that!

Fine! Y'know what?

You figure it out.

I screwed up, as usual.

So go for it, Louis.

Go for it!

Go!

He said "I must go."

Those very words!

Is it my fucking fault again?

Is it?

You guys think I'm an idiot!

And I've had it!

There was nothing bad in what I did!

Let's go.

It's not fair! You treat me like I'm a circus freak!

It's not fair.

You've no right! You can't always win! You can't do that to me!

Don't cry, Antoine...

I'll kill you!

Antoine, no!

Don't touch him, Louis.

Come. Don't.

Stop it. Get away from him.

Antoine, it's over.

Come.

It's over.

We'll be better prepared next time. in loving memory of François Barbeau

Ronronnement d'un moteur d'avion

-Monsieur ?

S'il vous plaît, monsieur.

Votre ceinture, s'il vous plaît.

-C'est ainsi qu'après 10 ans,

enfin, 12, si on ne compte pas

cette fois-là

Enfin, c'est ainsi qu'après

une douzaine d'années d'absence,

et malgré la peur,

j'ai décidé de retourner les voir.

Il existe

une variété de motivations

qui vous appartiennent,

qui ne regardent que vous,

qui vous poussent à partir,

dans la vie,

à ne pas regarder en arrière.

Et il existe une variété

toute aussi grande de motivations

qui vous poussent à revenir.

Alors c'est ainsi

qu'après toutes ces années-là,

j'ai pris la décision

de revenir sur mes pas.

Faire le voyage

pour annoncer ma mort.

L'annoncer moi-même et

paraître pouvoir me donner

et donner aux autres

une dernière fois

l'illusion d'être

jusqu'à cette extrémité

mon propre maître.

Voyons voir

comment ça va se passer.

Musique dynamique

Coucou.

-Maman, Toinot, il est là !

Il est arrivé !

Il a pris un taxi, ce con.

-Merde ! Je suis pas prête.

-Tu pouvais pas le faire avant ?

-J'avais les coudes

dans le Baba Ganoush pendant

que Mademoiselle s'admirait.

-Ça fait 15 plombes

que t'es en train de te préparer.

-J'ai le droit de vouloir

impressionner mon fils.

Louis aime la mode,

comme tous les gays.

-C'est pas une raison

pour se saper comme un travelo.

On ne va pas se prendre la tête

avant qu'il arrive !

-Ton problème, c'est que tu veux

toujours avoir raison.

Tu sais ce qui arrive,

dans ce cas ?

-Non et je m'en fous.

-Ton problème : "Je m'en fous,

je m'en fous."

Sèche-cheveux



-Le tacos, ça a dû te coûter

une blinde.

J'allais venir te chercher.

-C'est beau, tes cheveux.

Enfin, je vois mal,

mais ça a l'air beau.

Pourquoi t'as pris un tacos ?

-Je viens de le dire.

Tu connais Catherine ?

-Non.

-Catherine, Louis.

-Bonjour.

-Bonjour.

-Tu dois avoir chaud, non ?

Tiens, donne.

-Tu vas le laisser avancer ?

-Elle est contente.

-On dirait un épagneul.

-J'arrive, Louis ! Ce salaud

de vernis, c'est con, ça.

Le séchoir sèche pas !

-Je suis content, Catherine.

-Bien sûr.

Je veux dire aussi, moi aussi.

Bien sûr, je suis contente.

Oh là là

-Vous vous serrez la main ?

On dirait des ministres.

On dirait des étrangers.

-Ils le sont.

-À la bonne heure !

-C'est pas grave, Antoine.

-Embrasse-la, Louis.

-Je vous embrasse.

Enchanté.

-Enchanté ?

Comment ça, enchanté ?

-Ils se connaissent pas.

-Ils se connaissent pas.

Elle crie.

Pourquoi tu cries ?

-Jamais ils se sont?

Ben non, il était pas là.

-C'est pas possible,

elle a un grain, celle-là.

-J'avais oublié.

Enfin, j'avais pas réalisé.

Oh, la vache !

Vraiment, on vit

d'une drôle de manière.

Mon chéri. Non.

Louis.

Tu n'aimes pas

"mon chéri".

-Tu sais bien, maman.

-Il n'était pas là.

Il n'a pas pu venir

quand on s'est mariés.

-Je sais pas qui m'avait mis

une idée pareille

dans la tête.

-Après, l'occasion ne s'est pas

-Elle fait ça

pour avoir l'attention.

-Arrête, toi. Tais-toi.

-C'est bête pour le taxi.

Je serais venue te chercher.

J'ai une caisse à moi.

J'avais deviné. Hein, maman ?

Je te l'avais dit, hier.

-T'as fait bon voyage ?

-Hein, maman ?

-Je me souviens pas.

-Fait chier ! Je te l'avais dit.

-On s'en bat les couilles.

-Antoine

-Et t'as fait bon voyage, alors ?

-Oui. "Bon voyage",

faut rien exagérer.

-Bon. Ben Allez.

Musique douce

Sonnerie

-Louis est comme ça, il n'embrasse

jamais personne, sauf maman.

Même son frère

-Tu nous fous la paix ?

-Mais je te parle pas, à toi.

-Antoine

-Ils sont chez

leur autre grand-mère, ma mère.

Évidemment.

Mais on ne pouvait pas savoir.

C'était tellement

Je pouvais pas les lui retirer,

parce que sinon,

elle m'aurait fait une scène.

Mais ils auraient été

heureux de vous voir,

et j'aurais été heureuse

Enfin, Antoine et moi,

on aurait été heureux

qu'ils vous rencontrent.

Alors la plus grande, elle a 8 ans,

et tout le monde dit

qu'elle ressemble à Antoine,

qu'elle est

exactement son portrait.

On dit ça de tous les enfants.

Vrai ou pas, on le dit, non ?

-Oui.

-Oui.

-Bon. Alors,

les entrées dans le salon ?

Alors, charcuterie

de chez Célestin,

avec chorizo pour Louis.

T'aimes toujours ça ?

-Oui.

-Celle-là,

Antoine et elle, même caractère.

Une vraie tête de mule.

-Quelle chance !

-Hé, Louis,

vous m'avez envoyé un mot

Vous m'aviez,

vous m'aviez envoyé un mot

et des fleurs.

Oh ! Elles étaient belles.

Ça m'avait beaucoup plu.

J'avais beaucoup aimé.

Et moi, je enfin

Antoine et moi, on vous avait

envoyé une photo d'elle.

Et c'était ridicule.

Pas ridicule, mais elle tenait

dans la paume d'Antoine,

elle était toute petite,

tout bébé.

Tu te souviens, Antoine ?

-Non. J'adore oublier les trucs

les plus importants pour moi.

-Oui.

D'ailleurs, sur cette photo,

la ressemblance à Antoine,

zéro, zéro.

Pour le coup, zéro pointé.

Mais on ne ressemble à personne

quand on est petit, non ?

Elle a grandi.

-Tu crois pas que tu l'ennuies

un petit peu, avec ça ?

-Tu penses ?

-Pas du tout.

Pourquoi ? Non, Catherine.

-Non, mais c'est une maladie.

J'ennuie tout le monde, avec ça.

Les enfants, on croit être

intéressant, mais non. Surprise.

-Mais non, Catherine.

Je sais pas pourquoi il a dit ça.

Pourquoi t'as dit ça ?

C'est méchant.

Méchant non, mais déplaisant.

-C'est déplaisant.

Un peu de tenue, merde.

-T'as vu ta tenue ?

Ça fait pas "cauchemar à Tokyo" ?

-Je préfère ça que de vivre

sans comprendre que le marron,

c'est de la merde pour le teint.

-On dirait que tu t'es maquillée

à la truelle.

-Ça suffit, les enfants.

Musique mélancolique

-Louis.

-Catherine, ça ne m'ennuie pas.

Mes filleuls, mes neveux,

ça m'intéresse.

-Tant mieux.

-D'ailleurs

vous aviez un garçon

qui s'appelle comme moi,

Louis ?

-Oui.

Oui, pardon, oui.

-Ça m'a fait plaisir, ça.

Enfin, je suis touché.

Ça m'a touché, plutôt.

-Six ans, maintenant.

Six ans et

Ils ont deux années de différence.

Je ne sais pas

si je devrais développer

-Ne me fais pas porter le chapeau.

Si t'as envie de t'exprimer,

tu t'exprimes.

Ne me fais pas porter

Comme si je te brimais.

-T'es fou, Antoine.

T'es fou.

-Vas-y, explique.

Il t'écoute. Ça l'intéresse.

Alors explique-lui.

Il adore nos enfants,

les enfants de tout le monde.

C'est son sujet de prédilection.

Il s'intéresse à l'évolution

de notre progéniture.

C'est sa conversation préférée.

-T'es relou, là, Toinot.

-Ça va. Je m'excuse.

Excusez-moi, j'aurais pas dû.

Je ne voulais pas

Désolé. Je t'en prie, chérie,

explique.

-Je suis gêné.

Excusez-moi, Catherine.

Antoine, tu m'as mis mal à l'aise.

-Oh ! Je suis désolé, vraiment.

C'est encore la faute

du méchant Antoine

qui a volé la belle journée.

-Tais-toi, laisse-la parler.

Catherine, continue.

Ignore, ignore.

-C'est ça, Catherine.

-Pour ceux qui n'aiment pas la

trempette rouge, jalapeno. "Péno" ?

-"Penio."

-Enfin, piquante, quoi.

Et américaine, aussi.

Catherine, continue.

-Non, mais

Voilà. Ben, il porte le

Il porte le même prénom que vous,

enfin, que toi.

Et

Et ce que je trouve intéressant,

c'est que Enfin, avant tout,

il porte, si on remonte,

le prénom de votre papa.

Donc fatalement

-On est partis

dans les rois de France.

-Antoine,

je ne dis plus rien, alors.

Et toi, tu racontes et

Ou alors, personne raconte,

et on s'étouffe

avec la sauce américaine, là.

-Ça fait plaisir.

-Je voulais dire

-Exprime-toi, Catherine.

-Je plaisantais,

chérie.

Explique-lui.

Explique-lui.

-Il porte le prénom

de votre père, bon.

Je crois, enfin,

on croyait que ce serait bien.

Et moi, dans ma famille

-Ah ! C'est toi ?

- il y a une tradition

qui veut que le prénom des parents

ou du père du père de l'enfant mâle,

enfin, du premier garçon

tout ça, enfin, tout le

soit identique.

-Louis, Laurence dit bonjour.

Elle en revenait pas que tu sois là.

-Elle est toujours aussi conne,

celle-là.

-Et bon,

Antoine est votre aîné,

mais moi, "Antoine" non, non.

Mais "Louis", oui.

Et Antoine ne voulait pas

d'"Antoine".

Il disait que ça porterait malheur.

Puisque vous n'aurez pas d'enfants,

on s'est dit

qu'on ne vous volait rien.

Mais

Enfin, on dit ça,

mais en même temps,

vous pouvez, évidemment

Tout est possible.

Avoir des enfants.

Et vous en aurez, même.

Vous êtes encore jeune.

Vous l'auriez appelé Louis ?

Enfin, rien n'empêche,

hein, Antoine ?

-Catherine, tu m'aides ?

Vous avez faim ?

-Ça commence à venir.

-Louis, tu viens voir

ma chambre ?

-Ouais.

-Antoine,

viens me tenir les marmites.

Antoine. Antoine, tu m'entends ?

-Ouais ! Merde, putain !

-Je ne me souviens

pas beaucoup de toi.

J'étais petite et C'est pas

J'ai pas de souvenirs.

Je me souviens

parce qu'on m'a raconté.

Enfin, bref. Je dis ça, je

je gamberge.

C'est con, que tu sois parti,

je pense.

Con

Con pour moi, pour elle,

Antoine.

Pour toi aussi, non ?

T'es pas obligé de répondre,

mais peut-être que parfois,

t'as regretté ?

T'as eu besoin de nous ?

Je Je m'excuse.

-Non. Je suis là pour ça.

Entre autres.

-C'est drôle parce que

avant de recevoir

ta dernière carte ou lettre,

je me disais que

que voilà, ça faisait un moment.

Que c'était le moment.

-Oui.

-Et à chaque fois

c'est moi qui prends le courrier.

À chaque fois,

si je vois une carte

dépasser des lettres,

j'essaie déjà

de la mettre du côté de l'image.

Comme ça,

j'ai quelque chose à retourner,

quelque chose à découvrir

et quelque chose

que j'espère, quoi.

C'est drôle,

car on est tous là à te suivre,

à lire les articles,

à faire tout ça, quoi.

Enfin, tu le sais,

tu ne peux pas ne pas le savoir.

On éprouve Enfin, on Voilà.

On

On a tous une forme de

d'admiration

pour toi.

C'est con, mais

Enfin, c'est un don.

T'as un don.

Tu ris ?

-Oui, je

-Enfin bon, c'est un don, quoi.

Voilà. Un don.

C'est pas drôle.

Je te fais un compliment.

T'as un don. T'as de la chance.

Non, parce que tu ne t'en sers

pas vraiment pour nous.

C'est pour les autres.

Ou je sais pas,

peut-être pour personne.

Je te connais pas.

Enfin, je Je dis ça,

c'est pas des reproches.

Je Je constate.

Je réfléchis, c'est tout.

Fait chier, putain !

Ça me pique, ça. J'en peux plus.

-Quoi ?

-C'est ce maquillage.

J'en mets jamais.

Là, ça me gratte, putain !

Je voulais me Tu vois, quoi.

Le maquillage de maman,

c'est de la merde.

Il est rouge.

Alors je me suis acheté des trucs.

Tu veux pas t'asseoir, là ?

On serait plus "confo".

-Je suis bien, là.

Musique de radio

C'est que les miennes.

Toutes les

On appelle ça

"les phrases elliptiques".

Peut-être qu'on se goure,

avec "elliptique".

-Non.

Enfin, je sais pas. Je comprends.

-On a tous notre collection.

Antoine

maman, évidemment.

Mais elle a raison, t'as jamais

oublié nos anniversaires.

Les dates importantes de la vie,

quoi.

Il y a toujours une carte,

toujours un truc.

Enfin, je sais pas.

J'ai arrêté de me plaindre,

parce que

les sermons qu'on se prend

quand on dit que,

ben voilà, t'es pas là

"Il a fait

"et toujours fait

ce qu'il avait à faire."

-Elle dit ça ?

-Évidemment. Je l'ai pas inventé.

Mais t'inquiète, moi, je suis

Je suis une adulte.

Y a pas de souci.

"No soucy."

Pas

Pas "No soucy".

Je sais pas pourquoi je dis ça.

Je déteste.

C'est pas moi.

Je déteste cette expression.

C'est ridicule.

-C'est quoi, toi ?

-C'est drôle que t'écrives toujours

sur des cartes postales,

comme si t'étais en vacances,

comme si les facteurs

pouvaient voir ce que t'écris,

comme si

Tu laisses les gens voir

ce que t'écris d'important, toi ?

Quoique,

c'est pas les trucs les plus

Je suis C'est relou.

Je suis relou.

Tout le monde me le dit.

Excuse-moi.

Je voulais pas te

-Je suis désolé, Suzanne.

-Non, c'est moi.

Excuse-moi.

C'est cette canicule de merde

qui nous rend fous, là.

Mais ici, c'est pire.

Ici, tout est pire.

Moi, je voulais partir,

mais en même temps, je sais pas

Je suis bien.

J'ai le sous-sol, j'ai ma chambre,

j'ai le débarras.

C'est la pièce derrière toi.

C'est la chambre

où on a tout fourré

de l'ancienne maison, tes trucs.

Maman te demandera sûrement

si tu comptes les récupérer.

Non, je parie.

Enfin, de toute façon,

il y a des gens qui

Musique électro

Louis.

Tu m'écoutes ?

-Oui. Des trucs payés de ta poche.

Et la voiture, tu l'as payée ?

-L'ancienne d'Antoine ?

Maman l'a payée.

-Mais maman conduit pas.

-Et qui la conduit partout,

d'après toi ?

Et puis, ça me fait

une belle autonomie

si je veux descendre

voir les filles.

Ou je la conduis pour les courses.

Puis comme ça,

on ne dépend pas des autres.

Puis, on fait chier personne.

Et puis moi, j'aime bien

ces petits moments avec maman.

Elle est marrante, quoi.

Elle est relou aussi.

Mais bon.

-Non.

-Je savais que tu voudrais pas.

C'est pas ton genre, ça, hein ?

-T'es complètement pétée ?

-Non. Ça fait presque plus effet.

-En fait, ça pourrait me faire

du bien, fumer.

Normalement, je ne fume pas,

mais là

-Pourquoi t'es là ?

Tu veux nous présenter quelqu'un ?

T'es enceinte ?

-Pour vous.

Je sais pas.

J'aurais voulu revoir

l'ancienne maison.

-Pourquoi ?

Pourquoi tu veux revoir

cet endroit moche ?

-Je sais pas,

Suzanne, par nostalgie.

-C'est C'est pour une pièce ?

-Non.

Non.

-Suzanne, Louis,

vous montez ou quoi ?

-Arrête de crier !

-Vous montez ou merde ?

-Si tu veux,

tu peux aller voir le débarras.

Avec les trucs

de ton ancienne chambre.

"Par nostalgie."

Musique mélancolique

-Ça, ça me rappelle les dimanches.

-Non, s'il te plaît.

-Quoi ?

-Elle les connaît par coeur,

les dimanches.

-Mais laisse-la parler.

-Ça le gêne. Il aurait préféré

les grands voyages.

C'est pas pour rien qu'il est parti

en Chine après son bac.

-En Chine ?

-Ben, ouais.

-Donc moi, je travaillais,

mon mari travaillait,

enfin bref, on bossait.

Ah, mon chéri.

-T'as pas entendu l'histoire

depuis longtemps.

-Les dimanches ?

-T'as vu ? Même Louis, maman.

Même Louis.

-Laisse-nous vivre, Antoine.

-Louis, rouge ?

-Blanc.

Louis, c'est blanc.

-Blanc, s'il vous plaît.

-C'est un truc à nous.

C'est un truc de la famille.

C'est à moi, aussi.

C'est un rite, voilà.

-Je vous aide ?

-Non. Ça me détend.

Je prends de l'avance.

Je veux raconter

mes dimanches.

-Raconte-les.

-Alors dimanche : congé.

On sortait.

On allait se promener.

Systématiquement.

Systématiquement !

C'était comme ben, un rite.

-Tu vas où ?

-Nulle part. J'écoute.

-Reste avec nous, Antoine.

-Laisse-le. Écoute-moi.

Il aime ça, me peiner.

Alors on allait se promener, bon,

et on prenait la voiture.

J'ai jamais connu leur père

sans voiture, d'ailleurs.

À l'époque, avoir une voiture

Mais il avait travaillé.

Elle était à lui.

Elle était vieille, laide,

mais elle était à lui.

Le matin du dimanche,

il la lavait.

Il l'astiquait comme un maniaque.

Et l'après-midi, hop,

après qu'on avait mangé,

on partait.

Tous les dimanches.

Une tradition. Tous les dimanches,

qu'il neige, qu'il pleuve

-Non. "Qu'il vente,

qu'il pleuve ou qu'il neige."

-Ah oui, c'est ça.

Il avait toujours des phrases

comme ça

pour chaque situation de la vie.

-Ah bon ?

-Oui.

-Tu la connais par coeur,

cette phrase.

On connaît déjà ces histoires.

-Mais on fait ça, dans la vie.

On se rappelle,

on raconte des choses qu'on aime.

Elle connaît les dimanches,

mais j'aime lui redire.

Voilà pourquoi on raconte

les dimanches. Pour moi.

Si ça te plaît pas,

bouche-toi les oreilles

et retourne dans le salon

et arrête de nous enquiquiner.

-Quoi ?

-"Enquiquiner", tu connais pas ?

Emmerder. Il vient m'emmerder.

Et le premier dimanche de mai,

ou alors le premier dimanche

après le 8 mars, mon anniversaire,

ou alors si le 8 mars tombait

un dimanche, alors là, banco !

On disait

qu'on partait en vacances.

On conduisait une heure,

une heure et demie.

Les champs, les forêts,

les domaines, les vignobles, même.

On s'arrêtait,

on mangeait sur l'herbe,

on dormait sur l'herbe,

sur la couverture verte et rouge,

salade de thon,

riz, mayonnaise, oeufs durs

Antoine aime toujours

cette salade, hein ?

Il me dit toujours :

"Fais ta salade."

Il fait la tronche.

Et puis

Elle rit.

Et puis, le soir,

la route nous avait fatigués

et on disait On disait toujours :

"Ce qu'on est bien chez soi."

Comme quoi,

les voyages de bourges

dans le Sud,

les aéroports, les avions,

les hôtesses

qui vous parlent mal

Enfin.

Et puis après, bon, ben,

les garçons

étaient plus vieux et puis

Et puis, il y a eu Suzanne, quoi.

Antoine et Louis

avaient leur bicyclette.

Ben nous, on a arrêté

les dimanches parce que

seuls avec Suzanne,

ça valait pas la peine.

-Évidemment,

c'est notre faute.

-Ou la mienne, Antoine.

-Oh, purée !

Suzanne !

*O-Zone : "Dragostea Din Tei"

-Maman, laisse-moi, c'est bon.

-C'est quoi, cette daube ?

Tout ce qu'on fait,

c'est se rappeler

des souvenirs pourris,

écouter de la musique de crétins.

-C'est notre chanson de

-Ça va, maman. La honte.

-Notre chanson

de cours de danse aérobic.

-Viens leur montrer.

-T'es folle ou quoi ?

-Vous prenez des cours

d'aérobic ?

-Vas-y, marre-toi.

-J'adore cette chanson.

Je la trouve complètement barge.

-Tu vis dans une autre réalité,

mais c'est un tube de ouf.

-J'ai fait mes recherches.

C'est l'histoire

de Picasso en amour.

Enfin, j'ai pas tout compris,

mais

Allez, viens, quoi.

-Non.

-Allez, vas-y.

Embellis l'après-midi.

Impressionne ton frère.

-La gêne pas, Antoine.

-Allez, Suzanne, viens !

Allez. Allez, Suzanne.

Allez, viens.

Viens me montrer.

-Tu la massacres,

cette pauvre choré.

-Viens alors, viens me montrer.

Viens montrer à ta vieille mère.

-Un, deux, trois.

Maman, tu fais n'importe quoi.

-On dirait que tu as

une rupture d'anévrisme.

Maman, tu fais quoi,

pendant les cours,

à part mater le prof ?

-Il n'est pas assez beau pour moi.

J'ai encore l'oeil.



Il vomit.

Il tousse.

Sonnerie de portable

-Oui ?

Ah ! Mais t'es où ?

Pourquoi c'est écrit "Inconnu" ?

Ah, d'accord.

Non, pas encore.

Ça fait une heure que je suis là,

je vais pas leur

leur balancer ça comme ça.

Écoute. J'ai J'ai eu

de la difficulté avec ma soeur.

Je la connais pas.

Elle est belle.

C'est fou, ce qu'elle a vieilli.

Ils ont tous vieilli.

Moi aussi, évidemment.

Je me vois pas.

Je sais pas. À table, j'imagine.

Ou au café, au dessert,

je sais pas.

Quand je sentirai

que c'est le moment.

Je pense pas que je vais rester

après leur avoir dit.

Je sais pas comment ils vont réagir.

Peut-être

qu'ils pleureront même pas.

Écoute,

le moment est pas génial.

Je te rappelle, de toute façon. Oui.

J'ai peur.

J'ai peur d'eux.

OK. Ouais.

Allez, ciao.

Catherine crie.

-Pardon.

Pardon.

-Non, c'est Pardon. Désolée.

-Ça va ?

-Moi ?

-Ben oui.

-Oui. Oui, pourquoi ?

-Je sais pas.

On vous a pas beaucoup entendue

depuis tout à l'heure.

-Ah

Bon. Ben, c'est

C'est moi. C'est

Je Non, ça va.

Qu'est-ce que je peux vous dire ?

-Rien.

Je suis désolé

pour tout à l'heure, au salon.

Antoine, qui a dit que ça

m'intéressait pas, vos enfants.

Je sais pas pourquoi il a dit ça.

Il veut toujours croire

que je ne m'intéresse pas.

J'imagine qu'il a dû vous

vous monter contre moi,

vous prévenir.

Enfin, je suis désolé

pour tout à l'heure.

-Non, mais j'y pensais même plus.

Je Enfin

Bon. C'est C'est normal, quoi.

Mais pourquoi vous dites ça,

que

qu'il m'a prévenue

ou montée contre vous ?

-Une façon de parler.

Je connais Antoine.

-Ah oui ?

Pardon, je

Je sais pas

pourquoi vous avez dit ça.

Il

Antoine parle pas de vous

souvent, quoi.

Il Presque jamais.

Et quand il parle de vous

Non.

-Je voulais pas juger, vraiment.

Vous avez raison.

-Il croit que

Il croit que vous voulez

rien savoir de sa vie.

De lui, de moi, des enfants,

son métier et tout ça.

Vous connaissez son métier ?

Ce qu'il fait dans la vie ?

Vous connaissez sa

C'est pas un reproche, hein.

C'est Non. Vraiment.

Ne le prenez pas comme

C'est pas un reproche.

-Non.

-Mais

Vous connaissez sa situation ?

Il fabrique des outils

dans une petite usine

par là, pas très loin.

Et, enfin, moi-même

Moi-même, je

Je sais pas exactement

Voilà. Enfin, lui, il

Il pense que sa vie

vous intéresse pas.

Alors forcément, il

Enfin, c'est-à-dire

Il croit, je pense,

que ce qu'il fait n'est pas

n'est pas susceptible de

de vous intéresser.

Et je ne crois pas qu'il ait

qu'il ait totalement tort.

Ou je me trompe.

Peut-être, je me trompe.

-Peut-être.

Aujourd'hui, j'espérais que

-Non, non, non.

Attendez. Ne me dites rien à moi.

D'accord ?

S'il vous plaît.

Je préfère

que vous lui disiez à lui.

C'est moi

Ça change rien.

C'est pas mon rôle. D'accord ?

-Je n'allais rien vous dire

précisément, Catherine. On parle.

-Oui, mais Voilà.

Je ne suis pas bonne, pour parler.

J'ai

Ils Ils m'attendent.

À tout de suite.

-Ouais.

-Vous venez ?

-Oui, oui.

-Louis, viens.

Ferme la porte.

Je veux pas qu'Antoine me voie.

Il va me faire des histoires,

encore.

Je suis à 2-3 par jour, ça va.

J'ai arrêté d'arrêter, quoi.

Tu tiens le coup ?

-Oui, ça va.

-Trois mots.

Comme d'hab, quoi.

Toujours des

des réponses de 2-3 mots.

Comme sur tes cartes postales.

Ouh, ce sourire.

Le petit sourire.

-Écoute. Arrête.

-Ils ont réussi à te parler ?

T'as eu Suzanne plus tôt, non ?

Ils veulent te parler.

Ils ont des choses à te dire.

Et là, c'est possible,

alors ils vont en profiter.

Comme des gens qui savent pas

quand vient la prochaine fois.

Suzanne.

Elle connaît rien, la pauvre.

Elle te connaît pas, toi.

Elle t'imagine,

à travers ce qu'on raconte.

Et Antoine, lui

Tu sais comme il connaît

les choses, à sa manière.

Le problème, c'est que

On

On a peur du temps, quoi.

Le temps que tu nous donnes.

Et puis moi, je

Je me fais pas d'illusions.

Je sais que tu traîneras

pas longtemps.

C'est très bien comme ça.

Mais t'es là, t'es là.

Alors

Pardonne.

Pardonne, parce que

ils vont

Comment est-ce qu'on dit ?

Être abrupts ?

Ou maladroits.

-C'est pas grave.

-Je les imagine, aujourd'hui.

Oh là là !

Te poser leurs questions

et toi, tes 2-3 mots,

ton petit sourire,

fidèle à toi-même.

Qu'est-ce qu'ils seront déçus.

-Peut-être que j'ai pas

que 2-3 mots à vous répondre.

Peut-être que j'ai 2-3 mots

à vous dire.

-La chance !

Elle rit.

Je te taquine.

Mais ce sera pas assez, Louis.

Suzanne, ce sera pas assez

jusqu'à la prochaine fois.

Inutile de te demander quand.

Et Antoine, lui

il sera plus dur encore,

encore plus perdu à ton sujet.

Suzanne voudrait partir.

Elle te l'a dit, j'imagine.

Aller vivre une autre vie,

là-bas, loin, évidemment.

Et Antoine,

il voudrait plus de liberté.

Je le sens.

Il voudrait ne plus rien devoir.

À qui ? À quoi ?

À tout le monde, j'imagine.

À moi, surtout.

À Suzanne, je parie.

C'est à toi qu'ils veulent

parler de ça.

C'est comme s'ils voulaient

te demander l'autorisation.

Et je sais que tu n'as jamais

voulu prendre de responsabilités.

-Mais je suis pas l'aîné.

Je suis pas le substitut paternel

-Non, arrête tes conneries, Louis.

Arrête. Fais pas semblant, quoi.

C'est pas une question d'âge.

Utilise ta tête.

Tu vois bien, quoi.

Il n'y a pas que l'âge qui fait

qu'on est l'homme de la maison

dans la vie.

La stature, le salaire, la chance,

la beauté, les dons, le courage,

les choses qu'on a,

qu'on naisse avec ou pas.

Tu veux que je te fasse un dessin ?

C'est qui, l'auteur ?

Tu reviendras pas, je sais.

Encourage-les.

Personne l'a jamais fait.

Enfin, moi, si.

Mais moi, personne m'entend.

Quand je parle, c'est du vent.

Encourage-les, Louis.

Autorise-les

à faire telle ou telle chose.

Tu dis à Suzanne,

même si c'est pas vrai,

même si on tiendra pas

la promesse,

tu lui dis :

"Pourquoi tu ne viendrais pas

"2-3 fois l'an me voir ?"

Qu'elle peut.

Qu'elle a le droit.

T'es toujours

dans le quartier des gays ?

Quoi ? Oui ou non ?

-Non, non. J'ai déménagé.

-Quoi ?

Mais je t'écris

toujours là-bas, moi.

-Je reçois encore le courrier,

là-bas. Quelqu'un me l'apporte.

Je préfère ça.

-Tu préfères que ta mère

sache pas où tu vives ?

Putain !

C'est drôle.

Enfin tu es drôle.

T'as toujours pas compris.

Tu penses qu'on t'aime pas ?

Qu'on te comprend pas ?

T'as raison, je te comprends pas.

Mais je t'aime.

Je t'aime.

Et ça, personne

ne pourra me l'enlever.

Tu peux la garder

pour une de tes pièces.

Pourquoi t'es là ?

À moi, tu peux le dire.

Tu t'es dit : "Ça fait 12 ans,

j'ai pas vu le temps passer,

"je les appelle,

on se fait un barbec ?"

En tout cas, t'as bonne mine.

Je suis contente.

Merde !

Il est où, ce con ?

Je comprends pas.

T'as quel âge, là ?

-Moi ?

-Ben non, l'arrosoir.

Merci, saint Antoine.

Pour les bisous.

Pour Antoine. Pour la bouffe.

Et pour moi.

Tiens.

Sens. Dis-moi si je me le prends

pour Noël, comme cadeau.

De moi-même à moi-même.

Musique mélancolique

-J'ai 34 ans.

-Dis donc.

Ben, pour moi aussi, alors,

ça fait 34 ans.

C'est long.

Je me rends plus compte.

Tu fais ce que tu as à faire,

comme toujours.

C'est dingue, ça.

Je voudrais

Je voudrais prendre une photo

pour te montrer

C'est dingue comme t'as les yeux

de ton père, là.

Mais bon.

On n'est pas obligés de pleurer

ou de faire

des grandes déclarations.

Je disais ça pour

pour l'avenir, quoi.

Je pense à l'avenir.

La journée peut se terminer

comme elle a commencé,

sans nécessité, sans importance,

et bien, tant qu'on y est.

Juste bien.

-D'accord.

-Cette abrutie avait appelé

toutes ses poules Denise.

-Elle est déficiente.

-J'arrive dans le poulailler,

les poules couraient partout.

J'arrive et je dis :

"Elles sont jolies, vos poules.

"Comment elles s'appellent ?"

Elle me fait : " Denise."

Je fais : "C'est laquelle,

Denise ?"

Elle me fait :

"Elles s'appellent toutes Denise."

Rires

Elle avait appelé toutes ses poules

Denise !

-Si j'aime autant cette histoire,

ça veut dire que je vais en enfer ?

Elle est handicapée, non ?

Elle a une trisomie ?

-Ouais, elle a une trisomie,

je ne sais pas, 25, 32, 48.

Il n'y a pas une plus cool

que les autres.

On aurait pu lui dire :

"Ne les appelle pas toutes Denise."

-Moi, j'aime pas, en tout cas.

J'aime pas cette

Moi, je trouve ça mesquin,

je trouve ça déplacé.

-C'est rigolo, quoi.

-Mais bon,

ça, c'est sainte Catherine.

-Ça va ?

-Oui.

Quoi ?

-Tu veux faire autre chose ?

Te promener ?

Tu

On peut jouer à des jeux aussi.

-Tu fais chier avec tes jeux, toi.

-Fous-moi la paix. Ça va.

-Des jeux, je sais pas, mais

En fait, j'aurais bien voulu

ben

-Quoi ?

L'ancienne maison ?

-Oui.

-Quoi ?

-Ben, il veut revoir

l'ancienne maison.

Je veux bien te conduire,

si tu veux.

-Mais pourquoi tu veux y aller ?

T'es bête ou quoi ?

-Mais il est pas bête.

S'il a envie

T'es bête, toi.

-T'es conne.

-Mais pourquoi, Louis,

sérieusement ?

Pourquoi tu veux retourner là-bas ?

T'as oublié un truc

dans ta chambre ?

-Non, je

Je sais pas, comme ça.

Je suis curieux de savoir

voilà, de revoir les lieux,

de voir comment ils ont évolué,

comment le temps les a modifiés,

malmenés.

Elle est même pas en vente.

Je crois pas

qu'on puisse la visiter.

L'autre jour,

je suis passée devant,

elle est totalement abandonnée.

-Tu veux te retrouver

dans cette piaule de chiasse

pour voir

comment le temps a malmené,

modifié je sais pas.

T'as pas un plan

qu'on pourrait faire en famille ?

-Antoine

-Je dis pas ça

pour t'insulter, mais

-Non, de toute évidence.

-On a mis plus de 20 ans

à se barrer de là-bas,

et toi, tu veux

retourner là-bas pour vérifier

si le vent a bien déposé

les feuilles mortes

sur la toiture rouillée

en cette canicule ?

On s'en branle.

-Mais laisse-le, Antoine.

Il a juste envie

d'aller se promener.

Je veux dire

Moi, je peux t'accompagner.

-C'est pas grave.

C'était une mauvaise idée.

-Évidemment !

J'aurais envie de me branler

à Auschwitz pour écrire un poème.

-Antoine, ça suffit. Mauvais goût.

Bon. Allez.

Alors, Louis. Ben, raconte.

Raconte-nous une histoire.

Des potins.

-J'ai pas de potins.

-Ben, je sais pas. Invente.

Des potins, des potins du milieu.

Qui a couché avec qui,

qui a baisé qui,

qui s'est fait baiser

-Tu pues la clope, toi.

-Louis, ton verre.

-Non, merci.

-Oui, t'as fumé.

-J'ai pas de potins.

Je sors plus beaucoup.

-Vous prendrez un café ?

J'allais en faire un.

-Vous allez vous vouvoyer comme ça

toute votre vie ?

-Tu leur fous la paix,

un peu, ouais ?

-Mais merde !

Est-ce que je te parle ?

T'as fini de me les casser ?

De me reprendre

à chaque fois que je parle ?

De me dire de fermer ma gueule ?

Arrête de me faire chier.

-Les enfants, non, non.

Là, par contre, non.

-T'as vu comment elle me parle ?

-Mais c'est mérité.

-Tu me parles pas comme ça,

d'habitude.

-Mais je commence, là.

Je te parle comme je devrais

te parler quand tu m'emmerdes.

-Ah ! Ah oui, j'ai compris.

OK. D'accord.

C'est trop mignon.

Mais t'es mimi, toi. Hein ?

Tu veux avoir l'air cool

devant ton frère.

Tu fais comme ça

parce qu'il est là.

C'est toi, qu'elle essaie

d'impressionner.

Ça marche ? Elle t'impressionne ?

Hein, Loulou ? Loulou !

Loulou, Loulou !

Antoine rit.

Loulou

-Mais de quoi tu parles ?

De quoi tu parles ?

Maman, putain !

-Suzanne, les voisins.

-N'importe quoi, d'accord !

Rien à voir avec Louis !

Pourquoi tu veux toujours

m'humilier ?

Pourquoi tu veux toujours

humilier tout le monde ?

Merde ! Fait chier, putain !

-Suzanne, mais reviens.

Oh là là ! Tu la laisses partir ?

-Elle reviendra.

-Pourquoi ? Mais pourquoi ?

-Je veux bien, Catherine,

un peu de café.

-"Je veux bien un peu de café."

-Antoine

-"Antoine, Antoine, Antoine"

Quoi, Antoine ?

Quoi ? Ouais, c'est mon nom !

Je m'appelle Antoine.

J'en ai ras-le-bol !

-Bon

Ah ! J'ai mal choisi le moment.

Moi qui allais dire

que j'étais contente qu'on soit là.

Plus tard, peut-être.

Pas

-Pardon, Catherine.



Musique douce

Musique électro

-Louis ?

-Pardon.

-Pardon.

Je

Martine vous cherche,

et le dessert

serait prêt dans une trentaine,

quarantaine.

-Je monte. J'arrive.

-D'accord.

Désolée.

Combien de temps ?

Musique mélancolique

-Combien de temps quoi ?

-Combien de temps

Combien de temps

Antoine est tout seul là-haut et

Vous pourriez peut-être lui parler.

-J'arrive.

-Faut que je fume, là.

Je vais acheter des clopes.

-Tu sais, tu

Ah non, laisse tomber.

-Non, je sais.

C'est sympa,

de pas balancer maman.

Je fume pas beaucoup,

mais quand je fume, je fume.

-Et là, t'as besoin de fumer.

-Hum.

Tu viens ? Si tu veux,

en voiture, on pourrait

-Quoi ? Parler ?

-Non, mais

Je sais pas, ouais.

-Ben

Oui. J'ai besoin

de prendre l'air.

-Bon. Ben alors ? C'est réglé.

-Je suis pas arrivé

en fin de matinée.

J'ai voyagé cette nuit.

Je suis arrivé très tôt.

Je voulais voir le lever du soleil

à l'aéroport, manger au petit café.

Au début, j'ai pensé

que je viendrais

pour le petit déjeuner, mais non.

J'ai décidé d'attendre

le moment décent pour venir.

-Pourquoi tu me racontes ça ?

Pourquoi tu me dis ça ?

J'ai quelque chose à répondre à ça ?

-Non. Je sais pas, je te dis ça,

je voulais que tu le saches.

C'est pas important.

Je te le dis parce que c'est vrai

et que je voulais te le dire.

-Ben, écoute

Commence pas, OK ?

-"Commence pas" quoi ?

-Ça, Louis. Ça, là.

Commence pas à me gaver

avec des histoires d'aéroport,

j'aurais dû venir plus tôt

Et après, moi, je tombe dedans,

je me noie et j'ai pas envie.

Alors t'as voyagé cette nuit,

c'était bien ? C'était comment ?

Allez.

-Ça s'est bien passé, je sais pas,

c'était un voyage banal.

J'habite pas à l'autre bout

du monde. J'habite pas à

C'est pas la fin du monde,

de venir ici.

Je te dirai rien de plus.

Si tu veux pas parler, je m'en fous.

-Je t'écoute. C'est pas le problème.

Allez. Dis-moi. Raconte-moi.

Je t'empêche pas, allez.

Je veux savoir aussi l'aéroport,

le buffet et tout ça.

C'est la canicule.

On devient dingue.

-T'as raison,

ça vaut pas vraiment la peine.

J'ai juste pensé,

je sais pas, que tu

que tu serais heureux ou content,

content de savoir que, voilà,

ce matin, j'étais à l'aéroport,

au buffet.

Tu sais, le buffet ?

Et j'attendais.

J'allais pas débarquer le matin,

elles auraient eu peur.

J'imagine Suzanne, là,

qui m'accueille avec une carabine.

Elle se défonce tellement.

Je la vois l'attraper à l'envers

et se faire un trou dans la tête.

-T'as fini, là ?

-Attendant, je me suis dit

-"Attendant" ? "Attendant" ?

"Attendant." "Attendant."

-J'attendais, et je me suis dit :

"Tiens, je devrais le dire

à Antoine, ça,

"que j'attendais là, à rien foutre."

Y a que lui

qui pourrait comprendre.

Alors voilà, je te le dis,

juste à toi.

À elles, non,

elles seraient fâchées.

Elles auraient dit qu'on aurait pu

passer plus de temps ensemble.

Mais ça faisait du bien

de traîner seul.

Tu sais ce que c'est ?

-C'est vraiment Ça, c'est

C'est exactement ça

que je disais. Ça, là.

Ces histoires

qu'il faut que j'écoute.

Je savais.

Je suis pas con, je savais.

J'ai pas oublié ça de toi.

Tes histoires de longs détours,

des mots, des mots,

pour nous "confusionner",

pour nous enculer avec.

Et comme ça, après, on sait plus.

Et moi, je comprends rien.

-T'es malade, Antoine.

-Je suis malade ?

Toi, t'es malade.

Je la connais, ton histoire

d'aéroport, le buffet

Après, tu vas me raconter quoi ?

Les histoires de détails,

le mec

qui faisait cuire ses frites,

"l'odeur du gras

qui a imprégné mes vêtements,

"et moi,

j'étais seul, presque seul

"dans l'aéroport". Hein ?

On entendait une mouche voler.

Et toi, t'es là.

Je sais pas ce que tu fous

La voix s'éloigne.

D'ailleurs, je sais pas pourquoi

non plus t'es venu, Louis.

Personne sait.

Personne comprend.

Et ça, tu regrettes,

parce que ça si on le savait

Antoine rit.

Si on savait,

tu te serais déjà barré

ou tu serais même pas venu.

Tu crois que c'est important ?

Tu crois que c'est important

pour moi, l'aéroport, le buffet,

ton journal ?

Tu te trompes.

Ce n'est pas important pour moi.

Ce n'est plus important pour moi !

C'est pas ça que tu t'es dit,

à l'aéroport. Non.

Tu t'es pas dit que t'allais

me le raconter à moi.

Tu dis ça parce que tu remplis

le vide entre nous deux.

Et là, paf, je suis devant toi,

tu inventes, Louis.

Tu as tout inventé

pour pouvoir me parler. Hein ?

Pour pouvoir me parler,

pour que je me sente spécial.

Spécial de quoi ?

D'être le seul à savoir

que t'aurais pu venir

plus tôt ce matin ?

T'as pas pensé ça.

Tu me connais pas.

On veut pas partager

des trucs avec des étrangers.

D'ailleurs, moi non plus,

je te connais pas.

Tu t'es dit : "Je vais bien

commencer la conversation."

Tu sais pas très bien

comment m'attraper.

Hein ? Tu t'es dit :

"J'ai bien étudié,

j'ai vécu, j'ai écrit,

"je saurai comment le prendre."

On dit souvent ça

en parlant de moi :

"On sait pas comment le prendre."

"Ah, Antoine,

il faut savoir le prendre."

Comme on dirait ça

d'un animal dans une cage,

quand on approche la main pour

bien l'attraper avant de le noyer.

Tu t'es dit que t'avais

une technique

pour pouvoir bien m'attraper. Hein ?

Mais moi, j'ai pas envie, moi.

Moi, je ne veux pas, moi. Hein ?

Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?

Je ne veux pas savoir.

Je veux pas savoir.

T'es là, t'es pas là, t'as le droit.

C'est pas mon problème.

Tu pars, tu viens, tu t'en vas.

J'ai rien à dire là-dessus.

Tout n'est pas exceptionnel

dans ta vie, dans ta petite vie.

-Ralentis.

-T'étais assis

au buffet de l'aéroport

et tu ne pensais à rien.

Tu buvais un café

qui te donne envie de chier

et tu ne penses à rien.

T'es juste là

et tu vis ta putain de vie

et t'arrêtes de nous faire chier

avec ça ! Merde !

-Antoine

-Non.

Je veux pas être là.

J'ai pas envie que tu me parles.

J'ai peur, t'es content ?

Musique douce

Depuis toujours,

vous me racontez tout.

Et moi, faut que je vous écoute.

Mais moi, j'aime pas écouter,

j'aime pas parler, Louis.

Les gens qui disent rien, on pense

qu'ils sont bons pour écouter.

Je ferme ma gueule

pour qu'on me foute la paix.

Tu comprends ça, Louis ?

Hein ?

-Je comprends.

-Formidable.

Au fait Pierre est mort

la semaine dernière. Cancer.

-Pierre ?

-Jolicoeur.

Pierre Jolicoeur, ton Pierre.

Faut que j'y aille, je vais

me faire engueuler pour le dessert.

Musique dramatique

-Antoine, c'est toi ?

Mais ils sont où ?

-Quoi ?

-Ils sont où, les autres ?

-Je sais pas. Tiens

Tu veux me tenir le bol ?

-J'ai entendu quelqu'un entrer.

Vous voulez pas que j'aille

chercher tout le monde ?

-Ils viendront

quand ils seront prêts.

Aide-moi avec ça.

-Je comprends pas.

-Quoi ?

Tu crois que t'es la seule ?

-T'es beau quand tu ris.

Elle, là-haut, tu crois qu'elle a

compris quelque chose ?

Personne comprend.

Personne comprendra jamais.

C'est la beauté de la chose, non ?

-Je pense qu'Antoine et Louis

se sont disputés.

-Non, tu crois ?

-Antoine !

-On arrive.

Il n'y a pas eu de drame ?

J'étais petite,

je ne me souviens pas.

Des trucs tragiques,

de trahison, de meurtre

pour qu'il nous évite ?

-Lui, il pense pas à ça, lui.

Il ressent pas le besoin,

la nécessité de nous.

Il veut être loin.

Même quand il est dans le salon,

il est loin.

C'est lui, l'homme malheureux,

qui ne t'a pas vue grandir.

La vie a continué,

comme elle continue

cet après-midi, tranquille.

-Comme dans les livres.

Musique dramatique

-Tu peux décider d'être malheureuse

parce que ça t'arrange.

Alors décide d'être heureuse.

-Facile à dire.

-C'est presque fini.

-Ah bon ? Pourquoi ?



Pluie à l'extérieur

-Bon.

-Ouais. Entrée, repas principal,

amuse-bouches etc., non.

Mais dessert,

je ne donne pas ma place.

-Je

J'ai quelque chose à vous dire.

Des choses, en fait.

Je vais revenir.

Je vais venir plus souvent.

Et écrire.

Orage au loin

Écrire plus.

Plus souvent, plus longuement.

Parce que

Pluie

Voilà, je regrette.

Je regrette le temps qu'on a perdu,

que j'ai perdu.

Suzanne, si tu veux,

t'es la bienvenue chez moi.

Un week-end, une semaine,

plus, à voir les détails.

Et Antoine,

peut-être que si on dînait,

si on déjeunait,

on pourrait continuer

notre conversation

sans histoires.

Quand tu viendras.

-J'ai trop de boulot.

-Un week-end.

Un week-end.

-Le week-end, nous

-Tout le monde

peut survivre à un week-end.

Tu peux. T'as le droit, quoi.

T'aimes la ville.

-J'aime la ville ?

-Oui, t'aimes la ville.

Je dois partir.

Pluie

-Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?

-T'es pas bien ?

-Tout le monde va bien,

Antoine va mal.

Peut-être qu'il range.

Tu ranges, Antoine ?

Mais qu'est-ce que vous faites ?

Vous êtes pétés ?

Vous avez fumé ?

-Ça va, il a l'habitude.

-Tu veux partir ?

Je t'accompagne.

-Quoi ? Mais pas tout de suite.

Si ?

-Il vient de dire ça, non ?

-Mais non, non.

Tu dînes avec nous, Louis ?

-C'est moi qui ai mal compris.

T'as pas dit que tu avais

un rendez-vous ?

C'est ça que tu m'as dit, non ?

-T'es malade ou quoi ?

-Je suis pas malade, j'écoute.

Il a dit : "Je dois partir."

Je lui propose de le ramener.

Ça me fait un crochet de 30 minutes

pour aller chez ta mère.

-C'est parfait.

-J'arriverai juste à l'heure

à la maison pour le dîner.

-C'est quand la dernière fois

que t'es allé

à l'aéroport ?

-T'y es jamais allée.

-Mais j'y vais tout le temps !

Julien vivait là-bas.

-OK. Alors une heure,

une heure et demie.

Je veux pas

qu'il prenne de taxi.

-Ce n'est pas

la question, Antoine.

Louis, je ne comprends pas.

Tu pars ? Je peux t'accompagner,

ce soir ou demain.

Tu dors ici,

tu déjeunes même.

C'est quoi, ce rendez-vous ?

-Mais oui,

c'est quoi, ce rendez-vous ?

C'est important, vraiment ?

Ça peut pas attendre ?

Franchement, un dimanche,

excuse-moi

-Allez,

tu m'as dit que tu devais

-Tais-toi, toi !

C'est quoi, le problème ?

On était bien, on n'est plus bien.

Un moment comme ça, paf !

Pourquoi, Louis ? Pourquoi ?

-Ben parce que

j'ai un rendez-vous.

-Voilà, merci. Allez.

-Mais attends, mais je rêve,

Antoine ! Lâche-le !

Musique dramatique

Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?

-C'est bon, Antoine.

-Je t'aide à mettre ton manteau.

-C'est quoi, cette mascarade ?

C'est de la folie !

Vous êtes fous !

-Je veux juste

qu'il loupe pas l'avion.

-On prend le temps

de se dire au revoir.

-Eh ben, allez-y,

on dit au revoir.

-Mais il y a deux secondes,

on mangeait tranquillement,

on disait rien,

on avait un beau moment,

et toi, tu viens,

comme ça, tu brises, tu cours,

tu fous la merde !

Antoine, je te préviens,

je l'oublierai pas.

Ton frère essayait

Je comprends pas.

-Allez.

-Antoine

-Laisse-moi !

-Mais attends.

Moi, je l'accompagne.

-Suzanne, arrête !

Je l'accompagne. OK ?

Tu te conduis comme une

-Comme quoi ? Dis-moi !

-C'est moi qui l'accompagne.

Je reviens dans une heure.

-Ce que tu peux être désagréable.

Tu t'entends pas.

Tu te vois même pas.

Comment tu le brusques,

comment tu me parles,

comment tu parles à ta femme !

-Comment T'es vraiment

T'es vraiment une petite merde.

Défends-moi, Catherine !

-Évidemment

qu'elle va te défendre.

-Suzanne

-Je comprends pas.

Alors je viendrai.

Musique dramatique

-Louis. Louis.

Louis !

-À bientôt.

-Arrête ! Lâche-le, Antoine !

T'es débile ?

-Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?

-Tu nous gâches notre putain de vie

et notre putain

de journée avec Louis

avec ta connerie et ta brutalité.

-Ma brutalité à moi ?

-Oui, toi.

-Antoine

-Arrête. Laisse-moi.

-Calme-toi. C'est pas grave.

Juste calmons-nous.

Calme-toi.

Ne sois pas brutal.

-Je suis pas brutal,

j'essaie d'aider.

-Ça va, Antoine,

tu n'as pas été brutal.

-Toi, ça va.

-Et con, en plus.

-Toi, tu sais rien, OK ?

Toi, t'as rien compris.

T'es une petite conne.

Ferme ta gueule !

-Je te défends de parler comme ça

à ta soeur.

-Vous savez quoi ?

Démerdez-vous.

Moi, je voulais juste aider,

mais je me suis planté.

Alors vas-y, Louis. Vas-y.

Pourquoi t'y vas pas ? Vas-y !

-Non.

-Non ?

Il a dit

Il a dit : "Je dois partir."

Il a dit : "Je dois partir",

et c'est encore ma faute,

ma putain de faute ? Hein ?

Vous me prenez pour un imbécile.

Arrêtez avec ces conneries.

Il n'y avait rien de mal

dans ce que j'ai dit.

-Allez, viens, on y va.

-J'en ai ras le bol. C'est injuste.

Arrêtez de me regarder comme ça.

C'est pas juste.

Vous avez pas le droit.

Vous pouvez pas toujours

être contre moi.

Vous pouvez pas !

-Faut pas pleurer, Antoine.

-Arrête !

-Louis, ne le touche pas.

Antoine

Antoine, viens ici.

Laisse-le. Ne le touche plus.

Éloigne-toi de lui.

Antoine, c'est fini, maintenant.

Viens.

C'est fini.

On sera mieux préparés,

la prochaine fois.

# Capote

Hello?

Nancy?

Exactly.

But at least be honest about the facts.

-That's what l'm saying.

-Who's honest? l'm honest. l am honest about what l write about. l'll let you know if it's autobiographical, or if it's about me, or if it's not.

And l find autobiographical stories at this juncture of my life to be quite boring.

...say l'm one thing, but actually you're another thing. l think being true to who you are is important. l'm not saying you need to be psychoanalytical about the whole mess.

-But don't be afraid.

-Yeah, l... But don't be afraid. l had lunch with Jimmy Baldwin the other day.

-How is he?

-He's a lovely man.

And he told me the plot of his new book.

And he said to me, "But l just want to make sure it's not one of those problem novels."

And l said, "Jimmy,

"your novel's about a Negro homosexual who's in love with a Jew.

"Wouldn't you call that a problem?"

And he looked at me and he laughed because he knew l was right. l'm saying, you know, if you're gonna write something like that at least be honest why you're writing it.

Can't we just be honest?

Well, l don't think you actually need to be honest.

But don't come asking some white man from the South whether your book about a black man fucking some Jew, when they're both of the same sex, is an issue!

Don't ask me that!

Oh, no, it's not an issue, Jimmy.

Everyone's gonna be quite pleased with that topic.

So how about you, Truman?

Do you admit it?

Well, l'm not nearly that controversial. l'm not! l'm not! l am not. l'm not nearly that controversial.

Oh, come on.

Hi. lt's Truman for William Shawn, please.

Have you read the article about the killings in Kansas in the front section of The New York Times? l think that's what l want to write about. l want to go tonight.

-l figured you'd missed it.

-l'm sorry.

That's all right. l thought l was heading to Kansas by myself.

God, l'm glad you agreed to come.

You're the only one l know with the qualifications to be both a research assistant and a personal bodyguard.

Thank you.

Now l'm nervous.

Yes?

Mr. Truman Capote and Miss Nelle Harper Lee?

-That's us.

-Where would you like these, sir?

You can put that right there between the doors.

What all did you bring?

Just a few things.

-Thank you greatly, sir.

-Thank you.

You're welcome. lt's an honor to have you with us, sir, and l hope you won't mind me saying, but l thought your last book was even better than the first.

Thank you. l mean, just when you think they've gotten as good as they can get.

-Thank you very much.

-Ma'am.

You're pathetic.

-What?

-You paid him to say that.

You paid him to say that.

How did you know?

"Just when you think they've gotten as good as they can get?" l thought that was a good line.

-Do you think that was too much?

-Yeah, a bit.

Your keys.

-Sign here, please.

-Thank you.

Alvin Dewey,

Kansas Bureau of lnvestigation.

KBl.

Hi. l'm looking for Alvin Dewey.

Hi.

Mr. Dewey.

Truman Capote, from The New Yorker.

-Bergdorf's.

-Sorry?

-The scarf.

-Oh.

-Nice.

-Thank you.

Mr. Dewey, l wonder when we could arrange an interview, some time to talk.

About what?

Well, we're not looking for any inside information.

You know, l don't care one way or another if you catch whoever did this. l'm writing an article on how the Clutter killings are affecting the town.

You know, how you all are bearing up. l care.

-Excuse me?

-l care. l care a great deal if we catch whoever did this.

Oh, l see.

-As do a lot of folks around here.

-Oh, of course.

Do you have press credentials?

-What's a New Yorker?

-Magazine.

Magazines don't give out...

You can come to the news conference with the rest of them.

Sears, Roebuck.

The boy was 1 6?

He was 15.

Nancy was 16.

And it's her friend that found them?

-Laura Kinney.

-Can you spell that?

I assume you're okay with the Laura part.

K-l-N-N-E-Y.

But, pIease, Ieave her be.

There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans.

A whole bunch of Mexicans.

Hello, George.

It's good to see you again.

I do have an opinion whether this was the work of one man or "a whoIe bunch," as you said, but it doesn't matter a whole lot whether it was Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos.

We're gonna find whoever did this.

Now, four good peopIe from our community are dead.

So let's remember that.

The West Kansas Farm Committee is offering a $1,000 reward for information Ieading to an arrest.

PIease print that.

And thank you aII for coming.

He was foxy with that old man.

This make you miss Alabama?

Not even a little bit.

-You lie.

-l don't lie.

-Good morning.

-Hi.

Can any of you tell me where l'd find Laura Kinney? ls that her? With the boy?

Yeah, with Danny Burke.

Danny Burke?

Laura?

Thank you.

Truman. l'm gonna find out where that girl lives.

Can l do that alone?

All right?

Okay.

I think I scared a friend of yours this morning.

She came looking for you when I was writing.

-You hate my friends.

-No, I wouIdn't say "hate."

Just as long as they don't knock on my door. l saw the bodies today.

-Which?

-The Clutters. l looked inside the coffins.

That's horrifying. lt comforts me.

Something so horrifying... lt's a relief.

NormaI Iife faIIs away.

But then, I was never much for normal life.

No.

Yeah, people here won't talk to me.

They want someone like you, like Nelle.

Me, they hate. l can't think of a single quality l share with Nelle.

-Well...

-Maybe manliness.

-Good morning, Henry.

-Good morning, sir.

Let's go.

Bye.

Hi, Danny. l'm Harper Lee.

Nancy was your best friend?

Yeah, she was my best friend.

How has Danny been?

Pretty shattered.

Nothing terrible has ever happened to him before.

Danny was the last one at the house that night.

That's why Mr. Dewey keeps interviewing him.

They don't think that he had anything to do with it. lt's just to see if he remembers anything unusual.

People in town do seem to wonder if he was involved.

Yeah. That's been really hard for Danny.

Oh, it's the hardest when someone has a notion about you and it's impossible to convince them otherwise.

Ever since l was a child, folks have thought they had me pegged because of the way l...

The way l am.

You know, the way l talk.

And they're always wrong.

You know what l mean?

Yeah. l wanna show you something.

Maybe this will give you a better picture of what happened.

-What is this?

-lt's your diary.

"Danny here tonight and we watched TV.

"So nice just having him sit with us.

"Left at 1 1 :00.

"P.S. He's the only one l really love."

And that was that.

Did Laura say "shattered"?

"Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible has ever happened to him before."

You know l have 94% recall of all conversations?

94%? l've tested myself.

Well... how did that happen?

Apparently Detective Foxy's wife has read fiction.

That's great.

We're in.

-We are in.

-ln.

-You came.

-Hi.

-Thank you for having us.

-Thank you.

Get yourselves in here.

Alvin, get your pants on. They're here.

-Hey, little Deweys.

-Hi.

Hi.

Shake it with your wrist.

Use your whole arm.

More.

You think l'm kidding around, but l'm serious.

Mama would've put in half the bottle.

She had to buy it by the crate.

Alvin's gonna hate this. l have to stop.

Oh, l cannot believe you're from New Orleans. l miss it so much.

Well, l only lived there for a short while, but my mama was born and bred.

You know something?

Alvin pretends he doesn't know who you are, but the minute you came to town

-he read your books.

-No!

He had one of his men pick up

Breakfast at Tiffany's in Kansas City

'cause it's banned in the library here.

And he said, "l feel like you're spiting me." l said,

"Do you think l took this job to spite you?" l was writing the script as they were filming, all that time in ltaly and l'd work like mad all day long and then dash down to the bar around midnight to hand in the next day's scenes.

And Humphrey had just about moved into the hotel bar...

Humphrey Bogart.

...where he and John...

John Huston.

...had...

They drank every night.

And l mean drank, you know, like famished water buffaloes.

Well, l'd only just handed them the final scene when the bellhop told me l had a phone call.

And it was my stepfather, Joe Capote, calling to say that my mother had died. l flew home to New York, terribly distraught, but when l got to the apartment l could see that Joe was in even worse shape than l was.

He grabbed my hand and he said to me

"Talk.

"Talk about anything." You know?

"l mean, any subject in the world.

"Don't worry whether it'll interest me or not.

"Just talk

"so l won't break down."

He couldn't bear to be alone with his thoughts. lt was too painful. lt's been a hard couple of weeks for Alvin.

He and Herb Clutter were good friends from church.

Oh, Marie.

Oh, come on, Alvin. These are good people.

Why would they put a pillow under the boy's head just to shoot him?

Why would they tuck Nancy in?

So many of my friends would love to meet you.

-Oh, that'd be fine.

-You don't have to worry

'cause l'm not going to write about this till everything's over.

Well, l'm not worried. l know what room you're in at the hotel, and l know where you live in Brooklyn.

You're celebrating.

WeII, remember NeIIe's manuscript she sent me in New York?

Yeah. Mockingbird. KiIIing a Mockingbird.

-You said it was good.

-And I was right.

She just heard

Lippincott wants to publish it.

Well, Jesus.

Jesus, well, that's terrific.

Tell her congratulations from me.

Congratulations.

-Thank you.

-Jealous.

-Will you be home by Christmas?

-l wanna come home.

I wanna come home. I do. I just thought if they catch whoever did this, who knows what?

-l'll probably be here till next Christmas.

-l'm gonna let you go. l...

No, don't go.

We'll go away next spring to write.

-Maybe Spain.

-Yeah.

-Okay, l'm gonna let you go.

-Jack...

Jack, l promise.

We'll go away this spring to write.

-Maybe Spain.

-Okay.

AII right.

My wife worked there, too.

What did she do in the house?

Cleaning. Cooking a little bit.

Quiet, quiet. Quiet, quiet.

"Girdle up. No extra bulges.

"lf you're dressed right, when he gets home

"the rest of the evening should be smooth sailing.

"Bon voyage, gals." l can't believe you got that whole page. l only read it once.

-l've tested my...

-Tested myself.

-l have 94%...

-Percent recall.

-Cut that out.

-Cut that out.

Cut that...

Cut that out. lsn't that something, Alvin?

Oh, it's impressive.

Thank you.

-l'm sorry. He's upset.

-What's he upset about?

They know who did it.

Two men.

You know, they passed through Kansas City last week writing bad checks.

By the time Alvin's boys got up there, they were gone.

Skipped out.

Yeah. They don't know where.

No idea.

One of them had a cellmate who gave him up for the $1 ,000 reward.

Do they know the name of the cellmate?

No. No, l don't know. Alvin knows. l guess this isn't the appropriate time to go ask him.

He's beside himself.

Hello?

Alvin, get in here.

-Dad, it's the telephone.

-Not now, Alvin.

God damn it.

Get over here.

-Dad!

-Alvin, not now.

Sit.

Dad? Dad?

You need to call the Chief of Police in Las Vegas.

-Alvin, what'd you say?

-He said you need to call them immediately.

-Truman Capote.

-Dorothy Sanderson. l figured you'd be left alone this morning by that hardworking husband of yours so l have breakfast, and l have news, and l have literature.

My friend, Jack, mailed me that book you wanted and l inscribed it myself.

"To the maiden of the Midwest, the priestess of the plains,

"the queen of the kitchen, my first novel. Truman."

-You're too much. Come on in.

-Oh, thank you.

Go into the living room. Have a seat.

Let me get that. lt's been ringing all morning.

Hello?

Truman, l meant in here.

That's the women's cell. lt's hardly ever used, but they wanted them separate.

Let's sit in the living room.

They put you in the women's cell.

Do you have any aspirin?

My legs.

Truman?

Please. l'm sorry. ln the matter of the State ofKansas v. Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry Edward Smith this court has been informed by counsel, Mr. Weeks, that the defendants wish to waive their right to a preliminary hearing.

His mind is somewhere else.

Mr. Hickock, is that your wish?

Yes, sir.

Why are they doing that?

Mr. Smith. l ask that the waiver be effectuated.

"Effectuated?"

So noted.

Remove the prisoners.

Was it your choice to waive the hearing?

Do you still need some?

Give me your hand. l could kill you if you got too close.

Now, would you like some water, or...

Mrs. Sanderson lent you my book.

He said we'd curry favor with the judge if we waived our rights.

Who did?

The lawyer.

Your picture's undignified.

People recall first impressions.

What's been your first impression?

Hello.

-Mr. Shawn.

-Truman. l'm writing a book.

It's too much for a singIe articIe.

This town, the killers most of all.

You will be stunned by Perry Smith.

Why, what's happening?

Well, not much yet, but l know. l can sense him.

He's desperateIy IoneIy, frightened.

I have a question.

Are you ready?

-Would it matter?

-No.

How much more money can you send me?

And how quickly could you get Dick Avedon out here to take some pictures?

Who are you smiling at right now? l'm smiling at you.

You know, Dick's a very famous fashion photographer.

World-famous.

Am l gonna be in a fashion magazine?

So there's no worry of having a bad picture.

Who were you closer to, your mom or your dad?

-What's that?

-Who were you closer to,

-your mom or your dad?

-Well, both.

-Yeah?

-Yeah.

-Have you talked to them?

-Yeah.

Who'd you talk to first?

Perry, honey, you look terrific, baby.

That was good.

Can you show us the tattoo on your chest then?

Yeah.

Where did Perry get the art set?

Members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?

Yes, sir.

Defendants, rise.

Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene Hickock, you stand accused of four counts of the crime of murder in the first degree.

Have you reached a unanimous verdict?

We have, Your Honor.

What is your verdict?

Guilty on all four counts.

Have you unanimously reached a sentence?

We have, Your Honor.

What is the sentence?

Death. l need to see him before we go.

Perry.

They're going to transfer you up to Lansing today.

You'll have to make sure to put me on the visitors list.

Otherwise l can't see you. l'm going to help find you a proper lawyer.

You need a serious lawyer for an appeal.

Now they took Dick Iast night.

And I need you to get him to do the same thing and just put me on the visitors Iist.

And l thought, "Where does the family eat?"

You know? l mean, does he, like, reach his hand through the bars and have dinner with everyone around the table?

Nelle, kudos on... KiII the Bird, is it?

-That's close. Thank you.

-That's marvelous. Who's your publisher?

-Lippincott.

-Yes. lt's a children's book, right?

-Yes.

-No, no. lt's about children.

-Yes.

-Yes, l've heard a lot about it.

-Good.

-Congratulations.

-Thank you.

-l didn't even know she wrote.

He's sad and he's shy.

And he's terrified.

They shotgunned the entire family in the face.

And l thought, at first,

"l'm gonna be scared of these men.

"l'm gonna run, run right home."

Actually, the brother in the family,

Kenyon is his name, they had placed a pillow under his head and then shot him point-blank in the face.

Almost as if they were putting him to sleep, and then shot him.

This is the start of a great love affair.

Yeah. Truman in love with Truman.

The book l'm writing will return him to the realm of humanity. lt's the book l was always meant to write.

Well, he hasn't actually written a word of it yet, but he says it's the nonfiction book of the decade, so...

So, what have you been doing?

And l'll tell you, l was in Marilyn's apartment just last week, talking about movies, art.

Finally l had to break it to her that of the four Matisses hanging on her wall, two were upside down.

Can l have another, please?

To answer your question, l'm following Breakfast at Tiffany's by blazing a different path.

By inventing an entirely new kind of writing.

The nonfiction novel.

-You have a subject?

-Yes.

On the night of November 14, two men broke into a quiet farmhouse in Kansas and murdered an entire family.

Now, why did they do that?

Two worlds exist in this country.

The quiet, conservative life, and the life of those two men.

The underbelly. The criminally violent.

And those worlds converged that bloody night.

Now, l spent the past three months interviewing everyone in Kansas touched by that violence.

Now l spent hours talking to the killers and l'll spend more.

'Cause researching this work has changed my life.

You know, it's altered my point of view about almost everything.

Yeah.

And l think those who read it will be similarly affected.

So you find them a new lawyer.

Well, they're facing execution in six weeks.

You know, they need someone to argue whether or not that's right.

Okay.

And l'd also like to see them alive.

-Well...

-Yeah.

Yeah, l need to hear their stories.

Well, just be careful what you do to get what you want. l'm finding them a lawyer.

-Truman, you're finding yourself a lawyer.

-No, l'm finding them a lawyer.

There's a difference.

The Warden will see you now.

Well, we do all right by our boys.

Showers once a week. Feed them good.

We'll be feeding Perry Smith in the infirmary soon if he don't eat.

Try and get the food in through his arm. l'm sorry, what are you talking about?

Well, he hasn't eaten in a month. lt ain't his right to kill himself. lt's the right of the people.

The people of this state.

And that's who l work for, the people.

-No one told me.

-Yeah, he won't eat.

-When can l see him?

-Well, let me see.

How about you coming 3:00,

Thursday afternoon?

No.

That's no good. l need to see them now.

Then whenever l want, for as long as l want.

Well, that's just not how we do things around here, Mr. Capote.

Yeah, l understand what a burden unlimited visitation might be on this institution and on the people who pay for it.

And l want to be clear that l don't expect the citizens of Leavenworth County to have to shoulder that burden.

This is to be dispensed as you see fit.

You know, l didn't know where to count your boy at first, him being half-lndian.

But l did him a favor. l counted him as a white man.

You're a kind and generous man.

Spread your feet.

This way.

-Hey, hey.

-Yeah, hello.

Hey, thanks a lot for your help with the lawyer.

Oh, that's fine.

Wow. You must be really desperate for a story to come all the way out here.

You want to go see Perry, go ahead.

Thank you.

You want my advice, though, Mr. Capote, he's just trying to prove the insanity defense. lt's okay. lt's Truman. lt's your friend. lt's okay.

This is before she had us.

Before she started drinking.

Who took care of you as a child?

Orphanage.

Me and Linda.

And that's your sister?

You know, we're not so different as you might think.

Yeah, l was abandoned repeatedly as a child.

My mama would drag me along to some new town so she could take up with another man she'd met.

Night after night, she'd lock me in the hotel room alone.

Mama would turn the latch and tell the staff not to let me out no matter what.

And l was terrified.

And l'd scream my head off until finally l'd collapse on the carpet next to the door and l'd fall asleep.

Then after years of this she just left me with relatives in Alabama.

Who raised you up?

My aunts.

And that's where l met Nelle.

And she lived next door.

Your mother was lndian?

Cherokee.

So drinking was not a good thing for her.

No tolerance for it.

We're on suicide watch.

That's why they leave the lights on at night. l hope we're past that now. l do.

Be careful of Ricardo. l think he wants you all to himself.

All right.

But he's naturally mendacious.

Not to be trusted. lf he had $1 00, he'd steal a stick of chewing gum.

Perry, l want to take your notebooks with me. l want to read them. lf l leave here without understanding you the world will see you as a monster, always. l don't want that.

'Cause he trusts me. l mean, that's why he gave it to me.

And he's given me absolutely everything.

And he wants so badIy to be taken seriousIy, to be held in some esteem.

Do you?

Do l what?

Do you hoId him in esteem, Truman?

Well, he's a gold mine.

And he's told me his entire life.

His dead mother.

He had a brother and a sister kill themselves.

Awful.

Did you tell him your mama did the same thing?

See, l can't tell him everything.

We've been taIking our heads off for the past month.

And sometimes when l think how good my book can be, l can hardly breathe.

Anyway, this is what l wanted to read to you.

"lf called upon to make a speech"...

"lf called upon to make a speech?" l mean, this is exactly what l'm talking about.

A speech, just in case he's ever recognized for an achievement.

"l can't remember what l was going to say for the life of me.

"l don't think ever before have so many people been so directly responsible

"for my being so very, very glad.

"lt's a wonderful moment and a rare one.

"Thank you!"

There's an excIamation point at the end of that "thank you" in case you didn't catch it.

Where'd you go? l guess it stopped being funny. l never said it was.

Wait, listen to this. l was 14.

One day l said to her, "Mom's dead." l could see it.

A week Iater we got the news.

She finally drunk herself...

Found her shivering...

She hit me so many times with that flashIight, she broke it.

That night,

I dreamed about that big yeIIow bird.

Clawed that nun's eyes, bright like the sun.

Lifted me to the sky.

Sometimes you see a thing how it really is.

Well, you're nothing if not hardworking.

Hey, you look good. Healthy again.

You know, l've decided on a title for my book. l think you'll like it. lt's very masculine. ln Cold Blood. lsn't that good?

And that refers to the crime or the fact that you're still talking to the criminals?

The former, among other things. l see. l wanted to ask if you'd let me look at your investigation notes.

That lawyer you helped find for your friends got them a hearing at the Kansas Supreme Court... l heard this morning.

...on the issue of inadequate counsel.

Alvin, l mean, do you not want me to look at your notes?

You are permitted to say no. l'll tell you what. lf those boys get off, l'm coming to Brooklyn to hunt you down. l have to be in court at 9:00 but you call Roy Church and he'll show you what you want to see.

Thank you. lt's as much for me as for anyone. l couldn't bear the thought of losing you so soon.

We're gonna be able to use your book for our case.

You'll write we never got to raise an insanity plea.

You wrote how terrible the lawyers was. l haven't written a word yet.

What have you been doing?

Research. Talking to you.

All right.

-l had hoped...

-What are you calling it?

The book? l have no idea.

Perry, if l'm going to write about you, if l'm going to determine how to write about you, we need to talk about, you know, why you're here.

You know, the murders, and that night, at the Clutter house.

Do you worry what l'll think? ls that it?

Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor. l know a lot of people.

Perry, l have invitations to be in Morocco, Greece, and l prefer to be here, with you.

Jack, be patient with me. l'm just missing this one piece.

WeII, how Iong is that gonna take?

Why don't you just try Ieaving him aIone for a while?

Come to Spain.

You can aIways visit him Iater. l don't know.

WeII, I'm off. I'm just...

I've got my own writing to do.

Well, do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.

There's too many peopIe around. I've... l'll leave the address on the kitchen table.

Well, think about what I said, and join me when you can. l will.

-l will.

-Okay?

Bye.

Hi.

Truman.

We never intended on killing that family.

Capote, will you get that straight in your book, please?

No premeditation.

What are you doing? l have to fly back East.

When?

An hour. l miss you already.

Write me every five minutes.

Hey, you know, we never did intend on killing that family.

Capote?

What?

Truman,

I've not been abIe to tear myseIf away from your book.

It's that good.

It's not good, it's astonishing.

-This first haIf is astonishing.

-Oh, thank you.

When wiII you be done, do you think?

Yes, l'm already well into the third part.

But l can't finish that till l convince Perry to describe the night of the killings to me. l was planning to visit this fall, see?

Then I think you need to taIk to him now.

And we all need to see how this ends for the final part. l can't finish the book till l know what happens. lf Perry and Dick are executed, it's one thing.

And if not, well...

Truman, you got your ending. l really don't know.

The Kansas Court denied their appeal.

It came over the wire on Friday.

I mean, you need to taIk to Perry now.

He'll be dead by September.

I mean, I'm sorry. l know how much you've come to care about him.

Right. Yes, right.

So l want to set up a reading for you in the fall, in New York, and, well, we'll build some interest, and we'II pubIish in the faII.

Thank God. There's nothing in the house.

Why aren't you working?

Well, l knew you couldn't be counted on to stock the kitchen.

What are we going to feed our famous guest?

Oh, Jesus, l completely forgot.

Plus, l finished my novel yesterday.

What?

When was the last time you wrote to him? l don't know.

What's this? lt's a letter for Truman l was asked to deliver. lt's from Perry.

Let's have it.

"Dear friend Truman, where are you?

"Read this item in a medical dictionary.

"'Death by hanging is caused by asphyxia,

"'by fracture of the cervical vertebrae,

"'by laceration of the trachea.'

"Not too comforting, as we lost our appeal.

"Missing you.

"Alone and desirous of your presence.

"Your amigo, Perry."

Mr. Shawn told me about the court decision yesterday. l was wondering why you were in such a good mood.

That's a terrible thing to say. l write him all the time. l've just... l've been so focused on the book lately.

So Jack thinks l'm using Perry, but he also thinks l fell in love with him when l was in Kansas.

Now, how both of those things can be true is beyond me.

Thank you.

Well, did you?

Did you fall in love with him? l don't know how to answer that.

Truman. lt's as if Perry and l grew up in the same house, and one day he stood up and went out the back door while l went out the front.

-Are you kidding me?

-No.

Listen, you be nice to Jack.

Sometimes l think he's what l like about you best. l'll see you at the reading in New York.

-1 6th.

-1 6th.

Adiós.

What was he in jail for?

Well, they said it was for not paying his taxes, but really, for being an outsider.

Refusing to go along.

Lowell, you're being moved.

-Why?

-You're going to final holding.

No.

Come on, Lowell. Open the door.

Stand up.

-Put your arms behind your back.

-Okay, last chance.

Get up.

Turn around.

Put your arms behind your back.

Now Dick and me, we're next in line. l'm so sorry l've been away. lt was a long time. l know.

How's the book coming along?

Very slowly.

Will you show it to me? l've hardly written anything.

Good evening, New Yorkers, and thank you for coming to the first pubIic reading, the first offering of any kind, of Truman Capote's new work, ln Cold Blood.

Hello. My name is Truman Capote.

For this evening's program,

I'm going to read some passages from the first three parts of my new book.

"The viIIage of HoIcomb stands on the high wheat pIains of western Kansas,

"a lonesome area that other Kansans call 'out there.'

"UntiI one morning in mid-November, 1959

"few Americans, in fact, few Kansans, had ever heard of Holcomb.

"Like the waters of the Arkansas River,

"Iike the motorists on the highway,

"exceptionaI happenings never stopped there.

"Perry Smith's voice was both gentIe and prim.

"A voice that, though soft,

"manufactured each sound exactIy,

"ejected it Iike a smoke ring issuing from a parson's mouth.

"The four coffins, which quite fiIIed the smaII, flower-crowded parlor,

"were to be sealed at the funeral services,

"very understandabIy,

"for the effect was disquieting.

"Nancy wore her dress of cherry-red veIvet,

"her brother a bright pIaid shirt.

"The parents were more sedateIy attired,

"Mr. Clutter in navy-blue flannel, his wife in navy-bIue crepe.

"And it was this especiaIIy that lent the scene an awful aura,

"the head of each was compIeteIy encased in cotton.

"A swollen cocoon twice the size of an ordinary bIown-up baIIoon.

"And the cotton,

"because it had been sprayed with a gIossy substance,

"twinkled like Christmas tree snow.

"One Tuesday at dawn, a carload of strangers,

"ignorant of the IocaI disaster,

"were startIed by what they saw as they crossed the prairies

"and passed through HoIcomb.

"It might happen again."

Thank you.

And l slipped and l ripped a hole, from the bottom of my scrotum all the way up to the top of the crack of my ass.

And l sat there.

And l didn't know it. All l felt was a... l didn't know it. All l felt was a cool breeze, you know, between my...

Sorry. lf l may...

Yes.

Your portrait of those men was terrifying.

Terrifying.

Thank you.

Stop that man! Come back here!

Dad!

Have any of you met my father?

He hasn't spanked me in years.

George didn't come backstage.

He had... He had a...

Something that his wife had to rush him off to.

-But he made a point of...

-Well, l'm still waiting for a call. lt was beautiful.

And everybody came. Everybody came.

-Tennessee loved it.

-Of course he loved it.

Should we do more?

No, we just sit and wait while people talk about it, and we let them do the work. l mean, this book is going to change everything. lt's gonna change how people see your writing. l think it's going to change how people write.

-Are you gonna be finished by October?

-l think so.

You know, they're scheduled for next month.

To hang.

Yeah.

We're gonna commit as many issues as it takes to publish.

Whatever it takes.

Well, l'm going to Kansas tomorrow

-and l'll get Perry to talk.

-What's he got to lose?

Sorry, but...

Hey, this may sound strange to you but l'm going to miss him.

You'll be able to finish now.

Need to check your papers, sir.

This is what we've been waiting for.

A stay of execution to make a federal appeal.

All thanks to you.

Thank you!

They're not gonna corner me now.

Not unless the U.S. Government says so.

Kansas has had it in for me for 1 0 years.

They can't corner me now.

Hey, Perry, sit down for a minute. l need you to talk to me.

We've got all the time in the world to talk. l've been thinking about Ricardo.

You really need to stop sending him those trashy books. l won't even mention the pornography.

Now, l realize that Dick probably can't grasp the literature that you gave me.

And the books you send him only...

They only exacerbate the problem.

They only heighten or intensify it.

Maybe we can get him started on a program.

Perry, l know what "exacerbate" means.

Okay, well, just thinking...

There's not a word or a sentence or a concept that you can illuminate for me.

There is one singular reason l keep coming here.

-Truman.

-November 14, 1 959.

Three years ago. Three years.

And that's all l want to hear from you.

Now l asked you not to. Ever.

This is absurd.

Do you know what absurd means? l'm ready. l have a plane to catch. l found your sister in Tacoma.

Maybe she'll talk to me about something useful.

Please don't go out there.

Hey, this is my work, Perry. l'm working.

And when you want to tell me what l need to hear, you let me know.

June's dead. Frank shot himself.

Now Perry did what he did. l used to love him. He was my little doll.

He scares me now.

-When was the last time you saw him?

-Ten years ago.

Ten years.

Could l borrow one of these pictures?

Take the whole thing. l don't want them anymore.

Don't be taken in by my brother.

He's got this sensitive side he'll show.

You believe he's gentle and so easily hurt, but he'd just as soon kill you as shake your hand. l believe that.

Hello, handsome.

What's the name of your book? l don't know what you're talking about.

"Truman Capote read last night before a packed audience

"from his nonfiction book In CoId BIood. "

"The true-crime novel tells of killers Richard Hickock

"and Perry Smith,

"who brutally murdered a Kansas family three years ago."

-Wait, who sent that to you?

-That's not your goddamn business. lt is my business, because it's not true.

The organizers of the reading needed a title.

They picked one, a sensational one, l admit, to attract a crowd.

-They picked it?

-Yes.

-lt's not your title.

-Perry, l haven't chosen one yet.

How could l choose a title when we still haven't talked about that night?

How could l? l couldn't possibly.

You pretended to be my friend. l'm sorry. l should have told you.

And l couldn't pretend to be your friend,

'cause the truth is, l can't help wanting to be.

You don't have to tell me anything if you don't want to. l have something from your sister.

She misses you.

Look at my belly.

There must be something wrong with us, to do what we did.

We heard there was $1 0,000 in that house.

Once we tied up everybody and searched all over, l knew the guy that told us about it was wrong.

There was no money.

Dick wouldn't believe it, so he went tearing through the house, banging on the walls, looking for a safe.

When he was done he said he was gonna go up to Nancy's room and have his way with her. l wouldn't allow it.

And l told him that.

So l sat with her.

Dick came up and got me.

We turned off the lights and went down to the basement where Mr. Clutter and the boy was.

He kept saying, "No witnesses", but l figured if l waited him out, he'd...

He'd give up and we'd leave them tied up there.

And we'd drive all night.

They'd never find us.

We tied Mr. Clutter's wrists to a pipe over his head.

And he looked hurt, so l cut him down. l put a box out there so he'd be more comfortable.

He asked how his wife and daughter was and l said they were fine, and they were getting ready for sleep, and it wouldn't be long till morning when they'd find him.

He was just looking at me.

Looking into my eyes.

Like he expected me to kill him.

Like he expected me to be the kind of person who would kill him. l was thinking,

"This nice man is scared of me." l was so ashamed. l mean, l thought he was a very nice, gentle man.

And l thought so right up till l slit his throat. l didn't know what l did till l heard the sound.

Added up, how much money did you get from the Clutters that night?

Between $40 and $50.

I mean, the truth is,

I'm desperate to be done with it. l've spent four years of my life on this book.

They got a stay of execution yesterday.

Another, yes.

Supreme Court. lt's harrowing.

Me, all l want to do is to write the ending and there's no end in sight.

No, thank you.

"Dear friend Truman, haven't heard from you in such a long while.

"Please help find new lawyer.

"lf not, Dick will have to write the Supreme Court brief himself.

"Our last appeal.

What a pair of wretched creatures.

"Please help. Your amigo?"

"Perry."

Just put it with the others.

You know, at least for Nelle you should try and pretend you're having a good time tonight. l thought l'd find you here.

Oh, Nelle.

Thank you. l'll have another, please.

-How are you?

-Terrible. l'm sorry to hear that. l mean, it's torture the way...

What they're doing to me.

And now it's the Supreme Court.

And can you believe it? lf they win this appeal, l will have a complete nervous breakdown. l may never recover and l'll just pray that it turns my way.

-lt must be difficult.

-lt's torture.

They're torturing me. l see.

And how'd you like the movie, Truman? l frankly don't see what all the fuss is about.

Hello.

-Mr. Truman Capote?

-Yeah. l have a call from Mr. Perry Smith in the Kansas Correctional System.

WiII you accept charges?

Yes.

Mr. Smith, you're on the line.

Hello.

Hello?

Hello, Perry.

They Iet me make a coupIe of phone caIIs before I go down to hoIding.

You heard the Supreme Court rejected the appeal?

No, l didn't. l hadn't heard that.

Yeah. l'm sorry.

Yeah. They Iet me make two phone caIIs.

We got a date set for the warehouse,

Dick and me.

Two weeks and finito.

ApriI 14.

WiII you visit me?

Truman? lt's him again. lt is utterly inappropriate for me to talk to him.

Yes? l'm sorry, he won't be able to make it.

-Hello?

-Mr. Shawn, it's Nelle. l just got this telegram. Has he seen it?

He won't read it.

-WouId you put him on, pIease?

-Nelle, he won't talk.

Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him down and put the phone on his ear, l need to speak to him.

All right. lt's Nelle.

Truman.

"Miss Nelle Harper Lee and Truman Capote.

"Sorry that Truman was unable to make it here to the prison

"for a brief word prior to necktie party.

"Whatever his reason for not showing up,

"l want him to know that l cannot condemn him for it.

"Not much time left

"but want you both to know that I've been sincereIy gratefuI

"for your friendship through the years and everything eIse.

"I'm not very good at these things.

"I have become extremeIy affectionate toward you both."

"But, harness time."

"Adios, amigos. Your friend, Perry. "

Well, l didn't expect to see you again.

You can visit for a few minutes.

-Yeah.

-No.

Five minutes.

Well, well.

He returns. l don't know what you must think of me.

Well, you haven't been foremost on my mind lately as you can probably imagine.

You got the letter?

Yes, l did. lt's true. l understand why you didn't want to come. l wouldn't be here either if l didn't have to.

You got that right.

You know Ricardo donated his eyes to science?

Next week, some blind man will be seeing what Dick used to see.

Yeah, you could be walking in Denver or somewhere, Truman, and suddenly these eyes will be staring at you.

That would be something, wouldn't it? lt would be. lt would be.

You'll be watching? l don't know, l'll be...

Do you want me to? l'd like to have a friend there.

Okay. Then l will. lt's all right. l did everything l could. lt's okay. l truly did. l know. lt's time.

Mr. Capote.

Goodbye.

You're not rid of us yet.

-We'll see you in a few minutes.

-l wish l had...

Mr. Capote.

-Mr. Capote.

-Goodbye.

Nice to see you.

Perry Edward Smith.

For the crime of murder in the first degree, by order of the Court of Finney County, and the Supreme Court of the sovereign state of Kansas, you are sentenced to hang until you die.

"l will fear no evil: for thou art with me.

"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me."

You can say something if you want. ls there anybody from the family here?

No, Perry.

Well, tell them... l can't remember what l was gonna say for the life of me.

Our Father who art in heaven,

Hallowed be thy name.

Thy kingdom come,

Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread.

And forgive those who trespass against us.

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. lt was a terrible experience and l will never get over it.

They're dead, Truman. You're aIive.

And there wasn't anything l could have done to save them.

Maybe not,

-Hello. Hello?

Shoot.  God!

Hello! Oh, Jesus Christ!

Listen, what do you recommend for a catatonic fit in a parking garage?

I… Ugh, ask your doctor.

That's why I'm calling. He just canceled. 

Can I come over?

Donald, you're about a day and a half early.

-What am I supposed to do?

-I just got in.

I'm not ready for you yet.

Why did the prick cancel?

I don't know.

He said he was just too sick.

Why don't you tell him you're sicker than he is?

He already knows that.

Okay, Donald, come on over, but bring a bag of ice.

Please do not give me any responsibility.

At this moment, I cannot cope with anything weightier than the directions to your apartment.

If you want a cold martini when you get here, you'll cope with some ice.

-I'll cope with some ice.

-And hurry up.

I gotta go.

I was saying hello to an old friend.

What?

10th and Broadway, please.

Coming! Jesus Christ.

-How did you get inside?

-The street door was open.

-You want a drink?

-Not until I've had my shower.

I want something to work out today.

I'm gonna try to relax and enjoy something.

You in a blue funk because of the doctor?

Christ, no.

I was depressed long before I got there.

This should pick you up.

I went shopping today, and I bought all sorts of goodies. Look.

-Sandalwood soap.

-I feel better already.

-Mm-hmm.

-What we got here?

Oh! Your very own toothbrush, because I am sick to death of you using mine.

-How do you think I feel?

-You've had worse things in your mouth.

Oh, also for you, something called "Control."

Notice nowhere is it called "hairspray."

Just simply "Control" and the words "for men" written about 37 times all over the goddamn can.

Yeah, it's called Butch Assurance.

Well, it's still hairspray, no matter if they call it "balls."

It's all on your very own shelf, which is to be labeled

Donald's Saturday Night Douche Kit.

By the way, are you spending the night?

Nope, I'm driving back.

I still get very itchy when I'm in this town too long.

Why didn't the prick call you and cancel?

Suppose you'd driven all this way for nothing?

Why do you keep calling him a prick?

Who ever heard of an analyst having a session with a patient for two hours on a Saturday evening?

He simply prefers to take Mondays off.

He works late on Saturday taking Monday off?

What is he, a psychiatrist or a hairdresser?

Actually, he's both.

He shrinks my head and then combs me out.

Besides, I had to come in town for a birthday party anyway, right?

Oh, you had to remind me.

God, if there is one thing

I'm not ready for, it is five screaming queens singing "Happy Birthday."

-Who's coming?

-I think you know everybody anyway.

I mean, the same old tired fairies you've seen around since day one.

Actually, you know what?

There will be seven, counting Harold and you and me.

Are you calling me a screaming queen or a tired fairy?

Oh, I beg your pardon.

There will be six tired, screaming fairy queens and one anxious queer.

I'll be out of your way in a second.

I've only got one more thing to do.

Surgery? So early in the evening?

Sunt.

-That's French with a cedilla.

I've got to comb my hair for the 37th time.

Hair, that's singular.

My hair, without exaggeration, is clearly falling on the floor.

You're totally paranoid.

You've got plenty of hair.

No, what you see before you is a masterpiece of deception.

My hairline starts about here.

All this is just tortured forward.

Look.

That's not good, huh?

It's not the greatest.

- It's called getting old.

Oh, well.

One thing you can say for masturbation: you certainly don't have to look your best.

So what are you so depressed about?

I mean, other than the usual everything?

I really don't want to get into it.

Well, Donald, if you're not going to tell me, then how can we have a conversation in depth?

A warm, rewarding, meaningful friendship.

Up yours.

It's just that today I finally realized

I was raised to be a failure.

I was groomed for it.

Oh, Christ. How sick analysts must get of hearing how Mommy and Daddy made their darlin' into a fairy.

It's beyond just that now.

Today I finally began to see how some of the other pieces of the puzzle relate to them.

My neurotic compulsion to not succeed.

I realize it was always when I failed that Evelyn loved me the most.

Because it displeased Walt, who wanted perfection.

I began to fail on purpose to get love.

Failure is the only thing with which I feel at home because it's what I was taught at home.

No.

What is more boring than a queen doing a Judy Garland imitation?

A queen doing a Bette Davis imitation.

Where'd you get that sweater?

Oh, this clever little shop on the Right Bank called Hermès.

I work my ass off for 45 lousy dollars a week, scrubbing floors, and you waltz around throwing cashmere sweaters on them.

The one on the floor in the john is vicuña.

Oh, I beg your pardon.

You could get a job doing something else.

Nobody holds a gun to your head to be a charwoman.

That is, how you say, your neurosis.

Gee, and I thought it's why I was born.

Besides, just because

I wear expensive clothes, doesn't mean they're paid for.

That is, how you say, your neurosis.

However, thanks to the silver screen, your neurosis has got style.

It takes a certain flair to squander one's unemployment check at Joe Allen.

What's so snappy about being head over heels in debt?

The only thing smart about it is the ingenious ways

I dodge the bill collectors.

Yep, come to think of it, you're the type that gives faggots a bad name.

Oh, and you, Donald, you are a credit to the homosexual.

You're a reliable, hard-working, floor-scrubbing, bill-paying fag who don't owe nothing to nobody.

-I am a model fairy.

You think it's just nifty how I've always flitted from Beverly Hills to Rome to Acapulco to Amsterdam, picking up a lot of one-night stands, a lot of custom-made duds along the trail?

I'm here to tell you the only place in all those miles, the only place that I've ever been happy was on the goddamn plane.

Run, charge.

Run, buy, borrow, make, spend.

Run, squander, beg.

Run, run, run. Waste, waste… waste.

And why?

Finis. Applause.

-Hey.

-Don't. You don't have to.

Hey, come on.

Oh, there's nothing quite as good as feeling sorry for yourself, is there?

Nothing.

Okay.

I adore cheap sentiment.

Backstage, Funny Girl.

-Hi, it's Alan.

-Alan?

Oh, my God.

Alan, oh, I don't believe it.

How are you? Where are you?

I'm here… on business.

Listen, what are you doing tonight?

Oh, I'm tied up tonight.

Alan, tonight's no good for me.

Oh, I'm tied up, too, but I thought

I might just drop by for a drink.

What, you mean now?

Well, Alan, old boy, listen to me.

It is a friend's birthday, and I am having a few people in.

-Oh.

-And I'm sorry

I can't ask you to join us. It's just…

It just wouldn't work out, kiddo, you know?

And I'd hate to just see you for ten minutes

-and then have to say goodbye.

- Mickey, please?

Alan?

-Mickey?

-Alan…

What's wrong?

I've gotta see you about something right away.

Okay, Alan, come on over.

No, it's perfectly all right.

Just come on over, have a quick drink,

-but-but hurry up.

-Same old address?

-Yeah.

-Okay.

Well… am I stunning?

You're absolutely stunning.

You look like shit, but I'm absolutely stunned.

Your grapes are, how you say, sour.

Where's my drink?

I didn't make it. My old roommate from Georgetown just called.

-Alan what's-his-name?

-McCarthy.

He's up here from Washington on business or something, and he's on his way here.

I hope he knows the lyrics to "Happy Birthday."

Listen, asshole.

What am I going to do? He's straight.

What'll he feel about this freak show

I've got booked for dinner?

Ah, Christ, is that good.

He absolutely lost his spring on the phone.

He started crying, and that's not his style at all.

Alan's so goddamned pulled together, he wouldn't show any emotion if he were in a plane crash.

What am I going to do?

Are you suddenly ashamed of your friends?

Donald, you are the only person I know of whom I am truly ashamed.

Some people have different standards from yours and mine, you know?

And if we don't acknowledge them, then we're just as backward and narrow-minded as we think they are.

You know what you are, Michael?

You're a real person.

Thank you. Fuck you.

Do you want some cracked crab?

No, thanks.

How could you ever have been friends with a bore like that?

Well, believe it or not, there was a time in my life when I didn't go around announcing that I was a faggot.

That must have been before speech replaced sign language.

Don't give me any static on that score.

I didn't come out until I left college.

Seems to me that the first time we tricked, we met in a gay bar on Third Avenue during your junior year.

Cunt.

Thought you'd never say it.

Don't wait up.

Hi, doll face.

-You look cute.

-Always.

-Hello, Emory.

-Hi.

You know I hate coming between the two of you like this.

That makes one of us.

This is gonna be fun.

Oh, great.

Well, that's all we need, for it to rain.

-You want some more club soda?

-What?

There's nothing but club soda in that glass.

I've been watching you for several Saturdays.

You've actually stopped drinking, haven't you?

And smoking, too.

-How long's it been?

-Five weeks.

-That's amazing.

-I found God.

-It is amazing. For you?

-Or is God dead?

I could always tell when you were getting high. One way.

-I'd get hostile.

Hey, what made you stop? The analyst?

Oh. He certainly had a lot to do with it.

Mainly I didn't think I could get through another morning-after ick attack.

Morning-after what?

Icks! Anxiety, guilt, unfathomable guilt.

From the second your eyes open and you say,

"Oh, my God! What'd I do last night?"

Mmm, tell me about it.

And then that struggle to survive till lunch…

-Mmm.

-…where you have a double Bloody Mary.

That is, if you've waited till lunch.

And then you're half pissed again and useless for the rest of the afternoon.

So you hang on till cocktail time, and by then, you're ready for whatever the night holds, which hopefully is another party, and that whole goddamn cycle starts all over again.

Well, I have been on that merry-go-round long enough, and I either had to get off or die of centrifugal force.

Oh, Joe College has finally arrived.

All right, Donald, listen to me.

Don't insult me by giving me any lecture on acceptable social behavior.

-I promise to sit with my legs spread apart and keep my voice in a deep register.

Donald, you are a real card-carrying cunt.

All right. This is a raid.

Everybody's under arrest.

Hello, darling. Connie Casserole.

Oh, Mary, don't ask.

Hi, Emory. Come on, you can put it in the kitchen.

-Hi, Hank. Larry.

- Who is this exotic woman?

My dear, I thought you had perished!

Where have you been hiding your classically chiseled features?

I don't live in the city anymore.

I'll take those.

Emory, where's your present?

It's arriving later.

Larry.

Larry. Larry!

-What?

-Give Michael the gift.

Oh, here.

Louder, so my mother in Philadelphia can hear you.

-You were standing there in a trance.

-Was I?

-You both know Donald, don't you?

- Sure. Nice to see you.

-Hi.

-Nice to meet you.

Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you'd met.

Well, we haven't exactly met, but we've…

-Hi.

-Hi.

But you've what?

Seen each other before.

Oh, that sounds murky.

You've never met, but you've seen each other.

-What was wrong with the way I said it?

-They're gonna have their first fight.

The first one since we got out of the taxi.

- Where did you find this trash?

-Downstairs, leaning against a lamppost.

With an orchid behind my ear and big, wet lips painted over the lip line.

-Oh! Just like Maria Montez.

-Oh, please.

Hey, what have you got against Maria?

She was a good woman.

Hold on. Everybody, listen.

This old college friend of mine is in town, and he's stopping by for a fast drink on his way to dinner, but he's straight, so…

Straight? If he's the one I met, he's as straight as the yellow brick road.

No, you met Justin Stuart.

I don't remember meeting a Justin Stuart.

-Of course you don't, dope. I met him.

-This is someone else.

Yes, Alan McCarthy, a very close total stranger.

It is not that I care what he would think of me. Really.

It's just he's not ready for it, you know, and he never will be.

-You understand that, don't you, Hank?

-Sure.

Do you really think he doesn't know about you?

If there is the slightest suspicion, he's never let on.

-What's he had, a lobotomy?

Hey, I was super careful when I was in college, and I still am whenever I see him.

-I don't know why, but I am.

-Tilt.

I was just like Alan when I was in college.

I was very large in the dating department.

I wore nothing but those constipated Ivy League clothes, and those, oh, ten-pound cordovan shoes.

-No offense.

-Quite all right.

I butched it up quite a bit, and I didn't think I was lying to myself.

I really thought I was straight.

I know damn well I did not come out until after I graduated.

What about all those weekends up from school?

Oh. I still wasn't out.

I was still in the

Christ-was-I-drunk-last-night syndrome.

"Christ, I was so drunk last night,

I don't remember a thing."

That's it.

You were just guilty because you were Catholic.

-That's all.

-That is not true.

The Christ-was-I-drunk-last-night syndrome knows no religion, although there's a high percentage of it among Mormons.

Who do you have to fuck to get a drink around here?

Will you light somewhere?

We all somehow managed to justify our actions in those days.

You know, I later found out even Justin Stuart, my closest friend--

Other than Alan McCarthy.

Zip it. He was doing the same thing.

Only Justin was going to Boston on weekends.

You see, in the

Christ-was-I-drunk-last-night syndrome, you really are drunk.

That part of it is true.

It's just you also do remember everything.

Well, a lot of guys have to get loaded to have sex.

So I've been told.

Donald…

…if you remember, the first time we made it,

I was so drunk I could hardly stand up.

You were so drunk, you could hardly get it up.

-Christ, I was so drunk, I don't remember.

-Oh, bullshit. You remember.

-Oh, Jesus. All right, that's Alan.

Please, everyone do me a favor.

Cool it for the few minutes he's here.

Anything for a sis, Mary.

Emory, no!

I'm sorry, but that is exactly what I'm talking about.

-No camping.

-Sorry.

Think the Giants are gonna win the pennant this year?

-Fuckin' A, Mac.

-Oh, hey, Bernard.

-Hey, baby.

I'll take these. Everyone's outside.

You can put your present with the others.

-Oh, it's only another queen!

-And it ain't the red one either.

-It's the queen of spades!

Anybody ever tell you you'd look divine in a hammock, surrounded by louvers and ceiling fans and lots and lots of lush tropical ferns?

You're such a fag. You take the cake. Up!

-What about the cake? Whose job was that?

-Mine. I ordered it to be delivered.

How many candles did you say to put on it? 80?

Wait, Alan. There's too much noise.

I'll get another phone.

-Michael, did the cake come?

-No.

-Oh, God. Can I use your private line?

-Sure.

Listen, everybody, there is some cracked crab out there. Help yourselves.

Can I have the number for the

Marseilles Bakery in Manhattan, please?

-Is everybody ready for a drink?

-Yeah!

Ready? I'll be your topless cocktail waitress.

Please, spare us the sight of your sagging tits.

What are you having, kids?

-Is there any beer?

-Oh, in the fridge.

-I'll get it.

-Beer?

-Who drinks beer before dinner?

-Beer drinkers.

How can a sensitive artist like you live with an insensitive bull like that?

-I can't.

Well, here's hoping.

Alan, don't be silly.

There's nothing to apologize for.

It's just that I feel like such a fool.

I can shoot myself for letting myself act that way.

Look, it is just as well.

I have people over.

It wouldn't be a good time to talk.

Hey, what about this?

What if we do lunch tomorrow?

Sure. Why don't you meet me at the Oak Room at about one o'clock?

That sounds perfect.

And listen, Michael, can you just forget about tonight?

Pretend it never happened?

Alan, done. It's forgotten.

-I'll see you tomorrow?

-Great.

-Yeah, baby! Let's hear that sound! Whoo!

A drumbeat and their eyes sparkle like Cartier.

Terrible.

Wow, thanks, Bernard.

It's like you stock up for the whole summer.

You kidding? That'll last him two days.

-Well, he's not coming.

-Oh!

Some people eat, some people drink, some take dope.

-I read.

-Yeah, and read, read, read.

It's a wonder your eyes don't turn back into your head

-at the sight of a dust jacket.

-At least he's a constructive escapist.

Oh, that's true.

What do I do? I take planes.

No. No, I don't do that anymore because I don't have the money to do that anymore.

I go to the baths. That's about it.

I'm about to do both.

I'm flying to the West Coast.

You still got that act with the donkey in Tijuana?

I'm going to San Francisco on a well-earned vacation.

I'm going to the Club Baths, and I'm not leaving till they announce the departure of TWA one week later.

You'll never learn to stay out of the baths, will you?

-Bernard, don't… Bernard!

-The last time Emily took the vapors, this big hairy number strolled in.

So Emory says, "I'm just resting."

Big hairy number said,

"Oh, I'm just arresting."

-It was the vice.

-Emory!

You have to tell everything, don't you? Thanks, honey.

You live with your parents?

Yeah, but it's all right, they're gay.

Thought that was funny, Hank?

What happened to Alan?

Oh, he suddenly got terrible icks about having broken down on the phone.

Kept apologizing over and over.

Did this big about-face, reverted to the old Alan right before my very eyes.

-Ears.

-Ears.

Well, the cracked crab obviously did not work out.

I don't know why everyone has such an aversion to it.

Sometimes you remind me of the Chinese water torture.

No. No, I take that back.

Sometimes you remind me of the relentless Chinese water torture.

-Bitch.

- Whoo! Whoo!

- Wonder where Harold is.

-Yeah, where is the frozen fruit?

Emory refers to Harold as the frozen fruit because of his former profession as an ice skater.

Whoo!

You know he's out here looking rough.

If your mother could see you now, she'd have a stroke.

- Got a camera on you?

Oh, my God, it's Lily Law.

Everybody, three feet apart.

It's probably Harold now.

No, it's the delivery boy from the bakery.

-Oh, thank God.

-Ask him if he's got any hot cross buns!

Come on, Emory. Knock it off.

You can take her anywhere but out.

You remind me of an old maid school teacher.

You remind me of a chicken wing.

-I'm sure you meant that as a compliment.

-Good evening.

Hey, Bernard, remember that thing we used to do on Fire Island?

Whoo! That was in so far back,

I think I've forgotten.

I remember.

-Baby, come on, follow.

-What is it?

-It goes swing, swing. Hook, hook.

-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah!

Milk the cow, milk the cow, milk the cow…

You gotta swing it. You gotta hit it.

Look, it's the Geriatric Rockettes!

Here we go.

-God damn it, Hank!

-Why would you--

I thought… I'm…

You said that you weren't coming.

Well, I'm sorry.

Well, we were just acting silly.

When I called,

I was at a phone booth around the corner.

My dinner party isn't far from here.

Emory was showing us this silly dance.

I walked past, and your downstairs door was open.

This is Emory.

Everybody, this is Alan McCarthy.

Alan, counterclockwise, we have

Larry, Bernard, Donald, Emory and Hank.

-Nice to meet you.

-Hi.

-Would you like a drink?

-Thanks, no. I-I can't stay long.

You're here now, so stay.

What would you like?

-Scotch, please.

-Scotch.

-I'll get it.

- Thank you.

-Guess I'm the only beer drinker.

Whose, uh, birthday is it?

-Harold's.

- Harold?

- He's not here yet.

-She's never been on time in her li--

He's… never been on time in his life.

Hank, Alan is from Washington.

We went to college together, Georgetown.

-Ah.

-Yeah.

Well, isn't that fascinating?

If that's too strong,

I'll put some water in it for you.

It's fine, thanks. Fine.

-You in the government, Alan?

-No, I'm a lawyer.

-What do you do?

-I teach school.

Oh. Would have taken you for an athlete of some sort.

You look like you might play sports.

Well, I'm no professional, but I was on the basketball team in college.

-Played quite a bit of tennis.

-I play tennis, too.

-Great game. It is, yeah.

- Yeah, great.

-What do you teach?

-Math.

-Math?

-Yeah.

Math.

Kind of makes you want to rush out and buy a slide rule, doesn't it?

Emory, I need help in the kitchen.

-You're elected. Come on.

-I'm always elected.

-You're a natural-born domestic.

-Said the African queen!

You come, too. Fan me while I make the salad dressing.

- This way, Emory.

Why don't we all sit down?

-Sure.

-Yeah.

I feel terrible barging in on you fellas this way.

Ah, that's okay.

- How've you been?

-Fine, thanks. And you?

You married?

-What?

-I see you're married.

Oh.

Yes, Hank is married.

Donald, cope with some ice.

-Do you have any kids?

-Yes, two.

A boy, nine. A girl, seven.

You should see my boy play tennis.

Really puts his dad to shame.

-I have two kids, too. Both girls.

- Great.

-How are the girls, Alan?

-Oh, just sensational.

-Yeah?

-They're something, those kids.

God, I'm-I'm nuts about them.

-How long you been married?

- Nine years.

Ah!

-Can you believe it, Mickey?

-No.

Mickey used to go with my wife when we were all in school.

-Can you believe that?

Oh, Lord. Sorry.

You live in the city?

Yes, we do.

Oh!

I'm in the process of getting a divorce.

-Larry and I are roommates at the moment.

-Yes, they're roommates.

Oh, I'm very sorry. I mean--

-No, I understand.

- Mmm.

-I think I'd like another.

-Of course. I'm so sorry.

Can I help you, Alan?

Uh…

Can't seem to find the scotch.

It's in your hand.

-Oh.

Of course. How stupid of me.

-Why don't you let me do that for you?

-Thank you.

-Where the hell could Harold be?

-Oh, he's always late.

You know how neurotic he can be about going out in public.

Takes him hours to get ready.

-Why is that?

-Why is what?

Why does it take Harold hours to get ready before he can go out?

Because she's a sick lady. That's why.

Alan, why don't we go upstairs and talk?

I'm just gonna finish this and go.

Come on. You can bring your drink.

-I-I finished it.

- Here.

-Excuse me. We'll be down in a minute.

-Oh, he'll still be here.

-Come on. This way, Alan.

-Sure.

What was that supposed to mean?

-What was what supposed to mean?

-You know.

-Do you want another beer?

-No.

You're jealous, aren't you?

-I'm Larry.

You're jealous.

So, Donald, where have you been hanging out these days?

I haven't seen you in a long time.

- Alan…

I want to try to explain something about this evening.

What's to explain? Sometimes you just… can't invite everybody to every party, and…

Some people take it personally, but not me.

I should apologize for inviting myself.

That is not exactly what I meant.

Your friends seem like awfully nice guys.

That Hank is a very attractive fellow.

Yes, he is.

-What's his roommate's name?

-Uh, Larry.

What does he do?

He's a commercial artist.

I liked Donald, too.

The only one

I didn't care for too much was…

What's his name? Emory?

Yes, Emory.

Just can't stand that kind of talk.

It grates on me.

What kind of talk, Alan?

Oh, you know, his… brand of humor, I guess.

He can be really quite funny sometimes.

I suppose, if you find that sort of thing amusing. He just… seems like such a goddamn little pansy.

I'm sorry I said that.

I didn't mean to say that. That's… such an awful thing to say about anyone.

But you know what I mean, Michael.

You have to admit he is effeminate.

-He is a bit.

-A bit?

He's like a butterfly in heat.

There's no wonder he was teaching you all to dance.

He probably wanted to dance with you.

Oh, come on, man. You know me.

You know how I feel.

Your private life is your own affair.

No, I don't know that about you, Alan.

I-I… don't care what people do as long as they don't do it in public or try to force their ways on the whole world.

What were you crying about on the telephone?

All I-- All I can say is please forgive me for making… such an ass of myself.

You must have been upset or you wouldn't have said you were and that you wanted to see me, you had to see me.

-Michael, please.

-Is something wrong between you and Fran?

Listen, I've really gotta go.

Why are you in New York?

-Late for this dinner.

-Whose dinner? Where are you going?

-Is that the loo?

-Yes.

Excuse me.

What's going on in here?

Oh, Mary, don't ask.

Hank, why don't you come and join us?

That's an interesting suggestion.

Whose idea is that?

-Mine.

He means in conversation.

-Where are the rest of the wine glasses?

-I's working as fast as I can.

- To your health.

- Up yours.

Up my health?

-Where's the gent?

-He's in the gent's room.

If you can all hang on for five more minutes, he's about to leave.

-Well, at last.

♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

♪ Happy birthday, dear Harold

Happy birthday to you ♪

Oh!

Who the hell are you?

She's Harold's present from me and she's early, and that's not even Harold, you idiot!

You said whoever answered the door.

But not until midnight.

He's supposed to be a midnight cowboy.

He looks right out of the chorus of a bus-and-truck Oklahoma!

Not until midnight, and you're supposed to sing to the right person.

I told you Harold has very tight, tight, black curly hair.

This number's practically bald.

Thank you, and fuck you!

Good thing I didn't open the door.

-Not that tight and not that black.

I-I forgot.

Besides, I wanted to get to the bars by midnight.

Oh, he's a class act all the way around.

What do you mean, "get to the bars"?

Sweetie, I paid you for the whole night, remember?

I hurt my back doing my exercises, and I wanted to get to bed early.

Well, that's too bad. What happened?

-I lost my grip doing my chin-ups, and I fell on my heels and twisted my back.

You shouldn't wear heels when you do chin-ups!

I shouldn't do chin-ups.

I got a weak grip.

Aw, weak grip. In my day, it used to be called a limp wrist.

Who can remember that far back?

-What's your card say?

-Here. Read it.

"Dear Harold, bang-bang. You're alive."

"Now roll over and play dead."

-"Happy Birthday, Emory."

Sheer poetry, Emmy.

And in your usual good taste.

So conservative of you to resist a sign in Times Square.

-Cheese it, here comes the socialite nun.

-Shit. God damn it, Emory.

Well, I'm off.

Thanks, Michael, for the drink.

Oh, you're entirely welcome.

So I'll see you tomorrow?

No. No, I think I'm gonna be awfully busy.

Might even go back to Washington.

-Got a heavy date in Lafayette Square?

-What?

- Emory.

Forget it.

Are you Harold?

No, he's not Harold. He's for Harold.

-Goodbye, Hank. It was nice to meet you.

-Same here, Alan.

If you're in Washington,

I'd like you to meet my wife.

That'd be fun. Wouldn't it, Hank?

Yeah, I'm sure they'd love to meet him…

Her.

I have such a problem with pronouns.

How many S's are in the word pronoun?

How'd you like to kiss my ass?

That's got two more S's in it.

-How'd you like to blow me?

-Mmm.

What's wrong with your wife?

She got lockjaw?

Faggot! Fairy!

-Emory!

- You goddamn freak.

Motherfucker!

I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

Fucking faggot! Faggot!

-Get some ice!

- Freak!

What the hell is wrong with you, huh?

Just relax.

He just busted your lip, love. Larry?

-Here.

- Jesus.

- Damn it.

Do you mind waiting over there with the gifts?

Well, Harold! Happy birthday.

You're just in time for the floor show, which you can see is on the floor.

Hey, you, this is Harold.

♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

♪ Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday, dear Harold ♪

♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

What's so fucking funny?

Life.

Life is a goddamned laugh riot.

You remember life?

-You're stoned.

-Happy birthday, Harold.

You're stoned, and you're late.

You were supposed to arrive at this location at approximately 8:30 dash 9:00.

What I am, Michael, is a 32-year-old, ugly, pock-marked, Jew fairy, and if it takes me a while to pull myself together, and if I smoke a little grass before I can get up the nerve to show this face to the world, then it's nobody's goddamn business but my own.

And how are you this evening?

Happy birthday, Hallie.

- What happened to you?

-Don't ask.

Your lips are turning blue.

You look like you've been rimming a snowman.

That piss-elegant kooze hit me.

Careful, Emory. That kind of talk just makes him so nervous.

Who is she?

Who was she?

Who does she hope to be?

Who knows? Who cares?

His name is Alan McCarthy.

Not the famous college chum?

Is this my surprise from you, Michael?

I think Alan is the one who got the surprise.

- You'll notice he's speechless.

-I hope she's in shock! She's a beast!

Is it his birthday, too?

- That's your surprise.

-Speaking of beasts.

From me to you, darling.

How do you like it?

Well, I suppose he has an interesting face and body, but it turns me right off 'cause he can't talk intelligently about art.

Yeah, ain't it a shame?

-I could never love anyone like that.

-Never. Who could?

I could and you could, that's who could.

Mary, she's gorgeous.

She may be dumb, but she's all yours.

I think my present is a super surprise.

I'm so thrilled to get it.

I would kiss you, but I don't want to get blood all over me.

Look at my top!

Wait till you see your face.

Come on, Emory. Let's clean you up, hmm?

Happy birthday, Harold.

-Thanks, love.

- Top is ruined.

Take one of mine from the bedroom.

The one on the floor is vicuña.

Just another birthday party with the folks.

Here's a cold bottle of Pouilly-Fuissé

I bought especially for you, kiddo.

Pussycat, all is forgiven. You can stay.

No. You can stay, but not all is forgiven. Cheers.

Who asked Mr. Right to celebrate my birthday?

There are no accidents.

And who asked him?

Guilty.

Always got to have your crutch, haven't you?

I'm not leaving.

I feel sick. I think I'm gonna throw up.

Say that again, and I won't have to take my appetite suppressants.

-Easy does it. One step at a time.

I am not ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.

Nor will I be for the next two weeks.

Oh, my God! He's after me again!

-He's sick.

-Yeah, sick in the head.

Mary, take me home.

These queens are crazy.

Turning on.

-Anybody care to join me?

-Many thanks. No.

No, thank you.

How about you, Tex?

Yeah.

Michael, I left the casserole in the oven. Take it out anytime.

You're not going.

- I couldn't eat now anyway.

-Well, I'm absolutely starving.

I'll eat until I have a fat attack.

I said you're not going.

Beware the hostile fag.

When he's sober, he's dangerous.

When he drinks, he's lethal.

-Attention must not be paid.

- Well, I'm starved, Em.

I'm ready for some of your

Alice B. Toklas' opium-baked lasagna.

Are you really? Aw.

That makes me so pleased.

Maybe I'll serve it before I leave.

Nobody is going anywhere.

You're gonna have schmertz tomorrow you wouldn't believe.

-Hey, do a figure-eight on that.

I'm turning on. You're just turning.

-Michael? Is there any air spray?

- Hairspray?

You're supposed to be holding his head, not doing his hair.

Air spray, not hairspray.

There's a can of floral spray on top of the john.

Thanks.

I keep my grass in the medicine cabinet in a Band-Aid box.

Somebody told me it's the safest place.

If the cops arrive, you can lock yourself in the bathroom and flush it down the john.

That's very cagey.

Makes more sense than where I was keeping it.

In an oregano jar in the spice rack.

I kept forgetting, and accidentally turning my hateful mother on with a salad, but I think she likes it.

No matter what meal she comes over for, even if it's breakfast, she says,

"Let's have a salad!"

You are definitely the type that still moves his lips when he reads, and who sits in a steam room and says things like,

"Hot enough for you?"

I never use the steam room when I go to the gym.

It's bad after a workout.

It flattens you down.

Just after you've broken your back to blow yourself up like a poisoned dog?

-Yeah.

- You're right, Harold.

Not only can he not talk intelligently about art, he can't even follow from one sentence to the next.

But he's beautiful.

He has unnatural natural beauty.

-Not that that means anything.

-It doesn't mean everything.

Keep telling yourself that as your hair drops out in handfuls.

Not that it's not natural for one's hair to recede as one reaches seniority.

You know, faggots are worse than women about their age.

They think their lives are over at 30.

Physical beauty is not that goddamned important.

Well, of course it's not. How could it be?

It's only in the eye of the beholder.

And it's only skin-deep.

Don't forget about that one.

Oh, no,

I haven't forgotten that one at all.

It's only skin-deep, and it's transitory, too.

It's terribly transitory.

I mean, how long does it last?

30 or 40 or 50 years at the most?

Yes, it's too bad about this poor boy's face.

It's tragic.

He's absolutely cursed.

And how could his beauty ever compare with my soul?

And although I have never seen my soul,

I understand from my mother's rabbi that it's a knockout.

I, however, cannot seem to locate it for a gander, and if I could,

I would sell it in a flash for some skin-deep, transitory, meaningless beauty.

Forgive him, Father, for he know not what he do.

Oh, Michael, you kill me.

You don't know which side of the fence you're on.

If somebody says something pro-religion, you're against them.

If somebody denies God, you're against them.

One might say you have a problem in this area.

You can't live with it, you can't live without it.

-Hot stuff coming through!

-Hey!

You know what? One could murder you with very little effort.

You hang on to that great insurance policy called the church.

That's right, I believe in God.

And if it turns out that there really isn't one? Okay, nothing lost.

But if it turns out that there is,

I'm covered.

Harriet Hypocrite, that's who you are.

Right. I am one of those truly rotten Catholics who gets drunk, sins all night, and goes to Mass the next morning.

It depends on what you think sin is.

Would you shut your minty mouth and get back to the goddamn kitchen?

Say whatever you want. Just don't hit me.

Well, is it bigger than a breadstick?

He's laying down for a little bit.

-How does the bathroom smell?

-Better.

-Before it smelled like somebody puked.

Now it smells like somebody puked in a gardenia patch.

Dinner is served!

What would you like, big boy?

Alan McCarthy, and don't hold the mayo.

Oh, Em, it looks absolutely fabulous.

I'd make somebody a good wife.

-What is it?

-Lasagna.

Looks like spaghetti and meatballs sort of flattened out.

-Well, it's been in the steam room.

-It has?

-Oh, my God.

"It looks like spaghetti and meatballs sort of flattened out."

Oh, yes, Harold, truly enviable.

As opposed to you, who knows so much about haute cuisine.

Raconteur, gourmet, troll.

-It's good.

-You like it? Eat it.

Stuff your mouth so you can't say anything.

Turning.

- Wine?

- No, thank you.

Oh, go on, kiddo. Force yourself.

Have a little vin ordinaire to wash down all that depressed pasta.

Sommelier, connoisseur, pig.

Aren't you gonna have any?

No, my lip hurts too much to eat.

Anybody gonna bring a plate up to Alan?

Oh. The punching bag is now dissolved into Flo Nightingale.

Do you like it, Hallie?

Mmm. I'm having seconds and thirds and maybe even fifths.

I'm absolutely desperate to keep the weight up.

You're absolutely paranoid about absolutely everything.

Oh, yeah? Well, why don't you not tell me about it?

You starve yourself all day so that you can gorge yourself at one meal, and then you moan and groan about how fat you are and how ugly you are, when the truth is you're no fatter or thinner than you ever were.

-Polly Paranoia.

-This is great, Emory.

Connie Casserole. No trouble at all.

Oh, Mary, don't ask.

Oh! Oh! And this pathological lateness, that's downright crazy.

Turning!

Standing before a bathroom mirror for hours and hours before you can walk out on the street, and looking no different after Christ knows how many applications of Christ knows how many ointments and salves and creams and masks.

I've got bad skin. What can I tell you?

Who wouldn't after they deliberately take a pair of tweezers and deliberately mutilate their pores?

There's no wonder you got holes in your face after the hack job you have done on yourself year in and year out.

King of the pig people.

Yes, you've got scars on your face, but they're not that bad.

And if you'd leave yourself alone, you wouldn't have any more than you've already awarded yourself.

You'd really like me to compliment you now, wouldn't you, for how honest you're being?

For being my best friend who will tell me what even my best friends won't tell me, you hateful sow.

And the pills!

Harold has been gathering, saving, and storing up barbiturates for the past year like a goddamn squirrel.

Hundreds of Nembutals, hundreds of Seconals.

All in preparation for, and anticipation of, the long winter of his death.

I'll tell you right now, Hallie, when the time comes, you'll never have the guts.

It's not always like it happens in plays.

Not all faggots bump themselves off at the end of the story.

-What you say may be true.

Time will undoubtedly tell.

But in the meantime, you've left out one detail.

The cosmetics and astringents are paid for, the bathroom is paid for, the tweezers are paid for, and the pills… are paid for.

How much did you pay for him?

-He was a steal.

-I'm not a steal. I cost $20.

And what do you do for $20?

I do my best.

Oh, what a nifty sweater.

Thank you, Hank.

You can take it back, exchange it for something else.

Look, everybody, bejeweled knee pads.

Monogrammed.

Bernard, you're a camp!

Thank you, Michael.

What?

Oh.

-You're welcome.

- What is it, Harold?

It's a photograph of him in a silver frame, and there's an inscription engraved and the date.

What's it say?

Just something personal.

Hey, Bernard, what do you say we have a little music to liven things up?

-Okay.

-Yeah, I feel like dancing.

Come on, Michael.

Oh, no, thanks. I can only lead.

- I can follow.

-Oh, I think I'll sip this one out.

Ha!

-Michael!

- Everybody, help clean up.

Go, go, go! Come on!

-Come here, kid.

- Everybody, hurry up!

- Close the door!

- Come on, guys.

- Come on.

Get the fuck inside.

- Oh God.

I'm dripping all over.

Take a towel.

Don't get the goddamn furniture wet.

-Here. Towel. Dry off.

-Jesus, Michael.

-Thanks. Thanks, Michael.

Wanna dance?

Uh-oh, Yvonne the Terrible is back.

Oh, hello, Alan. You feel better?

Oh, no. No, no, no. Alan, no.

As they say in the Deep South, don't rush off in this inclement weather.

You'll never get a cab.

Revolution complete.

You missed the cake and you missed the opening of the gifts, but you're still in luck.

You're just in time for a party game.

Hey, everybody, game time.

Michael, why don't you just let him go?

He can go if he wants to, but not before we play a little game.

What's it gonna be, movie-star gin?

No. No, that's too faggy for Alan to play.

He wouldn't be any good at it.

What would you like to play, Michael?

The Truth Game?

Cute, Hallie.

Or would you like to play Murder?

-You all remember that one, don't you?

- Very, very cute.

As I recall, they're quite similar.

The rules are the same in both: you kill somebody.

-Mickey, I'm leaving.

-Stay where you are.

-Michael, let him go.

- He really doesn't want to.

If he did, he'd have left a long time ago, or he wouldn't have come in the first place.

-Mickey. I don't feel--

-My name is Michael.

I'm called Michael.

You must never call anyone called Michael "Mickey."

Those of us who are named Michael get very nervous about it.

If you don't believe it, try it.

I'm sorry. I…

I can't think.

You can think.

What you can't do is leave.

It's like watching an accident on a highway.

You can't look at it, and you can't look away.

Who's going to play with Alan and me? Everyone?

-I have no intention of playing.

-Yeah, nor do I.

Well, not everyone is a participant in life.

There are always those who stand on the sidelines and watch.

-What's the game?

- Simply this:

We all have to call on the telephone the one person we truly believe we have loved.

-I'm not playing.

-Oh, yes, you are.

-You'd like for me to play.

-I'd like to know who you'd call after all the fancy speeches

I've heard lately.

Who'd you call, Hank? Would you call me?

Oh! Sounds like there's, how you say, trouble in paradise.

Well, if there isn't,

I'm sure you could stir up some.

And who would you call? Hmm?

Don't think I think for one minute that it would be me.

Or that one call would do it.

You'd have to make several.

Three long-distance,

God only knows how many locals.

-I'm glad I don't have to pay the bill.

-Quiet.

Don't worry.

Michael won't pay it either.

Now, here's how it works.

If you make the call, you get one point.

If the person you are calling answers, you get two more points.

Somebody else answers, you only get one.

And if there's no answer at all… you're screwed.

You're screwed if you make the call.

When you get the person whom you are calling on the line, if you tell them who you are, you get two points. And then…

If you tell them that you love them, you get a bonus of five more points.

-Hateful.

Therefore, you can get as many as ten points and as few as one.

You can get as few as none if you know how to work it.

Hank, leave with me?

Oh, well, now, did you hear that?

You don't understand, Alan. I can't.

You can, but I can't.

If he doesn't understand, explain it to him.

-I'll explain it.

-I had a feeling you might.

Alan, Hank and Larry are lovers.

They're not roommates.

-Bedmates, lovers.

-Michael.

No man's still got a roommate when he's over 40 years old.

If they're not lovers, they're sisters.

-Hank is the one who's over 40.

-Well, you're pushing it.

Hank.

Yes, Alan. Larry and I are lovers.

But…

But you're married.

Jesus Christ.

I think you said the wrong thing.

Don't you love that quaint little idea?

If a man's married, he's automatically heterosexual.

Alan, Hank swings both ways… with a definite preference.

Now… who makes the first call?

-Emory?

-You go, Bernard.

-Mm. I don't want to.

-Go on, call up Peter Dahlbeck.

-That's who you'd like to call, isn't it?

- Who is Peter Dahlbeck?

The boy in Detroit whose family Bernard's mother has been a laundress for since he was a little black-eyed pea.

I worked for them, too, after school and every summer.

I think I've loved him all my life.

But he never knew I was alive.

Besides, he's straight.

Nothing ever happened between you?

They finally made it in the pool house one night after a drunken swimming party.

With the right wine and the right music, there are damn few that aren't curious.

And afterwards, we went swimming, in the nude, in the dark, only the moon reflecting the water.

How romantic.

And the next morning, you took him his coffee and Alka-Seltzer on a tray.

I remember I was worried sick all morning about having to face him, but he pretended like nothing at all had happened.

Christ, he must have been so drunk, he didn't remember a thing.

Odd how that works.

And now for ten points, get that liar on the phone.

- Mmm!

- Oh!

You know the number?

Sure, he's back in Grosse Pointe, living at home.

Just got separated from his third wife.

-Mmm-hmm.

- Mmm-hmm.

-DA or BY?

-What?

It's operator lingo.

It means "doesn't answer" or "busy."

He didn't even give it time to find out.

Come on, Bernard. Pick up that phone.

You know you want to call him.

You know that, don't you?

Well, go ahead.

Your curiosity's got the best of you now.

So go on, call him.

Do it.

-Hello?

- One point.

Who's speaking?

Oh!

-Mrs. Dahlbeck.

- One point.

It's Bernard.

Francine's boy.

- Son, not boy.

-Shh.

Oh, just fine, thank you.

Mrs. Dahlbeck, is-is… Peter at home?

Oh.

Oh, I see.

Oh, shit.

-Oh, no, no.

Oh, no, no. No, no.

It-It's nothing important. I, um…

I just wanted to tell him that…

Just to tell him that I…

I love him… and I've always loved him.

That I was very sorry to hear about him and his wife.

No points.

Mama wrote me.

Yes, it is. It-It-It really is. Well, uh…

Would you just tell him that I called and said that I…

That I, uh…

I was just very, very sorry to hear and hope they can get everything straightened out.

Good night. Uh-huh.

Goodbye.

Two points total.

-Terrible. Next.

-You all right, Bernard?

Why did I call?

Why did I do that?

-Where was he?

-Out on a date.

Come on.

Emory.

Punch in.

May I have a number, please?

In the Bronx.

For a Delbert Botts.

A Delbert Botts?

How many could there be?

Wish I hadn't called now.

No, the residence number, please.

Thank you.

I do wish Information would stop calling me "ma'am."

-Hey, by all means, scribble all over my phone.

It comes off with a little spit.

Ooh, like a lot of things.

Who the hell is Delbert Botts?

The one person I've always loved.

That's who you said to call, isn't it?

Right, emery board.

Ugh, how could you love somebody with a name like that?

Yes, Emory, you couldn't possibly love anyone with a name like that.

That wouldn't look good on a place card. Right, Alan?

I admit his name is not so good, but he…

Absolutely beautiful.

I've loved him ever since the first day I laid eyes on him, which was when I was in the fifth grade and he was a senior.

Then he went away to college, and by the time he got out,

I was in high school.

And he had become… a dentist.

And you went and had every tooth in your head pulled out, right?

No.

I just had my teeth cleaned, that's all.

-Oh, I shouldn't have called.

-Will you shut up, Bernard?

And take your boring, sleep-making icks somewhere else. Go.

I remember I looked right in his eyes the whole time.

I kept wanting to bite his fingers.

Well, it's absolutely mind-boggling.

-Phyllis Phallic.

-It absolutely boggles the mind.

I told him I was having my teeth cleaned for the junior-senior prom for which I was in charge of decorations.

I told him it was a celestial theme, and I was cutting stars out of tin foil and making clouds out of chicken wire and angel's hair.

Oh, Mary, it takes a fairy to make something pretty.

I got angel's hair down my shirt once at Christmastime.

Gosh, did it itch.

It would be terrible if you got that stuff in your…

I'll be quiet.

He was engaged to this stupid-ass girl named Loraine, whose mother was truly a real see-you-next-Tuesday.

Uh-uh. Don't digress.

Well, anyway… I was a wreck.

I mean, a total mess.

I couldn't eat, sleep, stand up, sit down, nothing.

Finally, I called him on the phone and asked if I could see him alone.

Clearly, not the coolest of moves.

He said okay.

Told me to come by his house.

I was so nervous, my hands were shaking.

I couldn't even look at him.

I just… stared straight in space and blurted out why I'd come.

I told him I wanted him to be my friend.

I said that I had never had a friend I could talk to and tell everything to and-and trust.

I asked him if he would be my friend.

He said he would be glad to be my friend, and anytime I wanted to see him or call him, to just call him and he'd see me.

And he shook my trembling hand, and I left…

-on a cloud.

-One of the ones you made yourself.

And the next day,

I went out and bought him a gold-plated cigarette lighter and had his initials monogrammed on it.

I wrote a card that said,

"From your friend, Emory."

Seventeen years old and already big with the gifts.

And then the night of the prom,

I heard Loraine and another girl I knew giggling together.

Obviously, Del had told Loraine about my calling and about the gift.

Pretty soon, everybody at the dance had heard about it.

They were laughing and making jokes.

Everybody knew that I had a crush on Dr. Delbert Botts and that I had asked him to be my friend.

What they didn't know was that I loved him, and that I would go on loving him years after they had all forgotten my funny little secret.

Well, I for one need an insulin injection.

Oh.

-Call him.

-Don't, Emory.

Since when are you telling him what to do?

Don't. You'll be sorry.

Take my word for it.

What have I got to lose?

Your dignity.

That's what you've got to lose.

Oh, that's a knee-slapper. I love…

You're telling him about dignity when you allow him to degrade you constantly by Uncle Tom-ing you to death.

He can do it, Michael.

I can do it. But you can't do it.

Isn't that discrimination?

I don't like it from him, and I don't like it from me.

But I do it to myself, and I let him do it.

I let him do it because it's the only thing that, to him, makes him my equal.

We both got the short end of the stick, but I got a hell of a lot more than he did, and he knows it.

I let him Uncle Tom me just so he can tell himself he's not a complete loser.

How very considerate.

It's his defense, Michael.

You have your defense, but it's indescribable.

Y'all want to hear a little polite parlor jest from the liberal Deep South?

Do you know why niggers have such big lips?

Because they're always going…

Christ, Michael!

Give me that. Let go, Michael.

I can do without your goddamn spit on my telephone, you nellie coward!

I may be nellie, but I'm no coward!

Yo, Bernard… forgive me. I'm sorry.

I won't ever say those things to you again.

Huh.

-BY.

-It's busy?

Loraine is probably talking to her mother.

Oh, yes, Delbert married Loraine.

I'm sorry, you'll have to forfeit your turn. We can't wait.

Well, you're not wasting any time.

-Who are you calling?

- Charlie.

I refuse to forfeit my turn.

It is my turn, and I'm taking it.

That's the spirit, Emory.

You hit that iceberg! Don't miss it.

Hit it! God damn it!

I want a smash of a finale.

- God, I'm drunk.

-You're a falling-down-drunk-nellie-queen.

Now that's the pot calling the kettle beige.

I am not drunk.

You cannot tell that I am drunk.

-I'm drunk.

- So am I.

-I am a major drunk.

-Shut up and dial.

I'm a major drunk of this or any other season.

It's ringing. It's no longer BY.

-Hello?

- One point.

Who's speaking?

Who?

Dr. Delbert Botts?

Two points.

Del, is this really you?

Nobody.

Yeah, you don't know me.

You wouldn't remember me.

Um…

I'm just a friend.

A falling-down, drunken friend.

Hello?

Hello?

Hello?

- He hung up.

-Three points total. You're winning.

He said I must have the wrong party.

Well, he's right. We have the wrong party.

It's your party, Hallie.

Having a good time?

Simply fabulous.

How about you?

Are you having a good time, Emory?

Are you having as good a time as you thought you would?

-My turn now.

-No, it's my turn to call Charlie.

No… Let me.

Are you gonna call Charlie?

Don't, Hank.

I want to.

Larry.

Be my eager guest.

Is he gonna call Charlie for you?

Charlie is all the people

I cheat on Hank with.

With whom I cheat on Hank.

The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker.

Right! I love 'em all, but what Hank refuses to understand is I gotta have 'em all.

I'm not the marrying kind.

I never will be.

Who're you calling?

Did it ever occur to you that Hank might be doing the same thing behind your back that you do behind his?

I wish to Christ he would.

Would make life a hell of a lot easier.

Who are you calling?

Well, whoever it is, they're not sitting on top of the telephone.

-Hello?

-Must have been in the tub.

One point.

- I'd like to leave a message.

-Oh, not in. One point.

Would you say that Hank called?

Yes, it is.

-Oh, good evening. How are you?

-Who the hell is that?

Yes, that's right.

The message is for my roommate, Larry.

-Just say that I called…

It's our answering service.

…and said I love you.

Hank, are you crazy?

You heard me correctly.

The message is for Larry.

It's from me, Hank, and it is just as I said.

I love you.

Yeah, thanks.

Seven points total.

Hank, you're ahead, baby!

You're way, way ahead of everybody.

Why, Hank? Why did you do that?

Because I do love him, and I don't care who knows it.

- Don't say that.

-Why not? It's the truth.

I left my wife and family for Larry.

-I'm not interested in hearing about it.

-Sure you are.

Go ahead, Hankola. Tell him all about it.

-I don't want to hear it! It's disgusting.

-Some men do it for another woman.

Well, I can understand that.

That's normal.

It doesn't always work out that way, Alan.

No matter how you might want it to, and God knows, nobody ever wanted it more than I did.

I really and truly felt

I was in love with my wife when I married her, but… there was always that something else.

Always?

I don't know. I suppose so.

I've known what I was since I was four years old.

Oh, everybody's always known it about you, Emory.

I've always known it about myself, too.

I don't know when I first admitted it to myself that…

I always labeled it something else or denied it completely.

Oh. "Christ, was I drunk last night."

There came a time where I couldn't lie to myself anymore.

I thought about it but never did anything about it.

The first time was during my wife's last pregnancy.

We lived near New Haven in the country.

There was this teachers' meeting in New York.

My wife didn't feel up to the trip.

I came into town on my own and…

That day on the train,

I began to think about it.

And think about it.

And think about it.

I thought of nothing else the whole trip.

And then 15 minutes after I had arrived,

I'd picked up a guy in the men's room of Grand Central Station.

Jesus.

I'd never done anything like that before.

I was scared to death.

He turned out to be a nice fellow.

I've never seen him again.

You know, it's funny.

Can't even remember his name anymore.

Anyway, after that, it got easier.

Practice makes perfect.

Then, sometime later,

Larry and I met at a party my wife and I went in town for.

And your real troubles began.

That was two years ago.

Why am I always the goddamn villain in this piece?

If I'm not the happy home-wrecker,

I'm an impossible son of a bitch to live with.

Guilt turns to hostility.

-Isn't that right, Michael?

-Go stick your tweezers in your cheek.

I'm fed up to the teeth with everybody feeling so sorry for poor, put-upon Hank.

Aw, Larry, everybody knows you're Frieda Fickle.

Hey, I never made any promises.

I never intend to.

It's my right to lead my sex life without answering to anybody,

Hank included.

And if those terms aren't acceptable, then we can't go on living together.

Numerous relations is a part of the way I am.

You don't have to be gay to be a wanton.

By the way I am,

I don't mean gay. And Emory…

You are the most promiscuous person I know.

-I am not promiscuous at all!

Not by choice, by design.

Why would anybody want to go to bed with a flaming little sissy like you?

-Michael!

- Who'd make a pass at you?

I'll tell you who. Nobody.

Except maybe some fugitive from the Braille Institute.

-Why do you let him talk to you that way?

-Physical beauty isn't everything.

Thank you, Quasimodo.

What do you think it's like living with a goddamn Gestapo, huh?

Can't even take a breath without getting the third degree.

-Larry, it's your turn to call.

-And I am so sick of this let's-be-faithful- and-never-look-at-another-person routine.

That doesn't work.

If you want to promise that, fine.

Then you promise it, and you stick to it.

But if you have to promise it, as far as I'm concerned, nothing finishes a relationship faster.

Give me Librium or give me meth.

Yeah, freedom, baby! Freedom!

You got to have it.

It doesn't work any other way.

And-And the ones who swear their undying fidelity to each other are lying.

Most of them, anyway. 90% of them.

They cheat on each other constantly and then lie through their teeth.

I'm sorry I can't be like that.

It drives Hank up the wall.

There is that 10%.

The only way it stands a chance is with some kind of understanding.

I've tried to go along with that.

-Come on!

-I agreed to an agreement.

-Your agreement!

- What agreement?

A ménage.

A lot of people think that's the answer, but that's not my style.

I certainly didn't want it!

-Then who suggested it?

-It was a compromise!

- Exactly!

- You agreed!

I didn't agree to anything.

You agreed to your own proposal and then informed me that I agreed!

I don't understand. What's a--

I will kick you!

The ménage, baby.

Two's company, three's a ménage.

Oh.

It works for some.

-Well, I'm not one for group therapy.

I can't relate to anyone or anything like that.

I'm old-fashioned.

I like 'em all, but I like 'em one at a time.

Did you like Donald as a single side attraction?

Yes.

-Did you tell him?

-No.

It was perfectly obvious from the moment you walked in.

What was that song and dance about having seen each other but never having met?

Don't look at me like that, Hank.

You've been playing footsie with that penguin all night.

Oh! I suppose you want the three of us to have a go at it.

-At least that would be together.

-Well, that point eludes me.

What kind of an understanding do you want?

Respect!

Respect for each other's freedom without any need to lie or pretend.

Hank, in my way, I love you, but you have to understand although I want to live with you, sometimes there might be others.

If that happens,

I know I'll never mention it.

But if you ask me, I will tell you.

He gets points!

What?

He said it. He said "I love you" to Hank.

He gets the bonus.

-He didn't call him.

-He called him.

He just didn't use the telephone.

- Then he doesn't get any points.

-He gets five points.

He didn't use the telephone.

He doesn't get a goddamn thing!

It's for you, Hank!

Hello?

One point.

Hello, Hank.

Two points.

This is Larry.

- Two more points.

For what it's worth, I love you.

Five-point bonus.

I'll…

I'll try.

I will, too.

-That's ten points total.

-Larry is the winner.

Well, that wasn't as much fun as I thought it would be.

Game isn't over yet.

It's your turn, Alan.

Pick up the phone, buster.

-Michael, don't.

-Stay out of this!

You don't have to, Alan. You don't.

Emory, I'm sorry for what I did before.

Forget it.

Forgive us our trespasses.

Christ.

You guys joined at the goddamn hip now?

Who are you going to call, Alan? Hmm?

Can't remember anyone?

I believe this will be the final round.

Michael, aren't you gonna call anyone?

How could he? He's never loved anyone.

♪ No matter how you figure

It's tough to be a nigger ♪

- Stop that, Michael!

-♪ But it's tougher to be a Jew ♪

My God, Michael, you're a charming host.

Michael doesn't have charm, Donald.

Michael has counter-charm.

-Wait, are you going somewhere?

-Yes, excuse me.

You're going to miss the end of the game.

With any luck,

I won't be down until it's all over.

What do you suppose is going on up there, hmm, Alan?

What do you imagine that Larry and Hank are doing up there, hmm?

Whatever they're doing, they aren't hurting anyone.

And they're minding their own business.

Yeah, and you mind yours, Harold.

I'm warning you.

Are you, now?

Are you warning me?

Me?

I'm Harold.

I'm the one person you don't warn, Michael, because you and I are a match.

And we tread very softly with each other because we both play each other's game too well.

I know this game you're playing.

I know it very well, and I play it very well.

You play it very well, too, but you know what?

I'm the only one who's better at it than you are.

I can beat you at it, so don't push me.

I'm warning you.

You're funny, Hallie.

You're a laugh riot. Isn't he funny, Alan?

Or as you might say, "Isn't he amusing?"

He's an amusing faggot, isn't he?

Or, as you might say, freak.

That's what you called Emory, wasn't it?

A freak, a pansy.

God, what an antiquated vocabulary you have.

I'm surprised you didn't say

"sodomite" or "pederast."

You better let me bring you up to date.

Have you ever heard the term "closet-queen"?

You know what that means?

Do you know what it means to be "in the closet"?

If you're insinuating that I'm a homosexual,

I can only say that you're mistaken.

Am I?

What about Justin Stuart?

What about Justin Stuart?

You were in love with him, that's what about him.

And that is who you are going to call.

Justin and I were very good friends.

That's all.

According to Justin, that friendship was quite passionate.

What do you mean?

I mean that you slept with him in college several times.

-That's not true.

- Several times.

One time, it's youth.

Twice is a phase, maybe.

Several times, you like it.

-It's not true.

- Yes, it is!

Because Justin Stuart is a homosexual!

He comes to New York on occasion, and he calls me.

I've taken him to parties.

Larry had him once, and he has told me all about you.

Then he told you a lie.

You were obsessed with Justin.

That is all you talked about morning, noon and night.

You started doing it about Hank upstairs tonight.

"What an attractive fella he is."

All that transparent crap.

-I said he was attractive. That's all.

-How many times do you have to say it?

How many times did you have to say it about Justin?

What a good tennis player he was, what a good dancer he was, what a good body he had, how bright he was, how amusing he was, how-how the girls were all mad for him, what close friends you were.

We were very close, very good friends.

That's all.

It was obvious.

And when you did it around Fran, it was downright embarrassing.

-Even she must have her doubts about you.

-Justin lied.

If he told you that, he lied.

He'd say anything about me now to get even.

He could never get over the fact that I dropped him.

You ended the friendship, Alan, because you couldn't face the truth about yourself.

You could go on sleeping with Justin as long as he lied to himself and you lied to yourself.

And you both dated girls and you labeled yourselves men and you called yourselves

"just fond friends," but Justin finally had to be honest, and you couldn't take it.

-You couldn't take it, and so…

-No.

…you destroyed the friendship and your friend along with it.

- No.

-Oh, yes.

Justin never understood what he had done wrong to make you drop him.

-He blamed himself.

- No.

He did, until he eventually found out who he was.

-And what he was.

- No!

But to this day, he still remembers the treatment.

-Scars he got from you.

-No.

You pick up this phone, and you call Justin.

No.

I want you to call him and apologize.

You tell him what you should have told him many years ago.

-He lied. Not a word of it is true!

- Call him!

All right, then I'll dial.

You're so helpful.

Give it to me.

Hello?

One point.

It's Alan.

Two points.

-Yes. Yes, it's me.

- Is that Justin?

- You sound surprised.

I should hope to think so, after all this time.

Two more points.

I'm in New York.

Yes, I…

I won't explain now, I just… called to tell you…

That I love you. God damn it, I love you.

I love you.

You get the goddamn bonus.

Ten points total. Jackpot!

-I love you, and I beg you to forgive me.

-Give me that. Give me that!

Justin, did you hear what that son of a bitch said?

Fran.

No, of course I knew it was you.

How are you?

Yes.

Yes, he told me everything.

No, now, don't thank me.

Please. Please, don't thank me.

I'll put him back on.

My love to the kids.

Darling, I'll take the first plane I can get.

Yes, I'm sorry, too.

I love you very much.

Thank you, Michael.

Who won?

It was a tie.

-Now, it is my turn.

And ready or not, Michael, here goes.

You are a sad… and pathetic man.

You're a homosexual, and you don't want to be.

But there is nothing you can do to change it.

Not all your prayers to your God, not all the analysis you can buy in all the years you have yet to live.

We may very well one day be able to know what it is to live a heterosexual life if you want it desperately enough, if you pursue it with the fervor with which you annihilate.

But you will always be homosexual as well.

Always, Michael.

Always.

Until the day you die.

Oh, friends… thank you for a nifty party and a super gift.

It's just what I needed.

Bernard, thank you.

And you'll get him home?

Don't worry about her.

I'll take care of everything.

Good to see you, Donald.

Good night, Harold.

-See you again sometime.

-Yeah.

How about a year from Shavuot?

Come on, Tex. Let's go to my place.

Are you good in bed?

Well… I try to show a little affection.

Keeps me from feeling like such a whore.

Uh, Michael, thanks for the laughs.

Call you tomorrow.

Come on, Bernard. Time to go home.

Mary, you're a heavy mother.

Why'd I call?

-Why?

-Hey, thank you, Michael.

-Good night, Donald.

- Good night, Emory.

I'm gonna take you for some coffee, and everything's gonna be all right.

-Careful.

Donald?

-Donald, Donald. Donald?

-Michael?

-Oh, my God, what have I done?

-Christ, Michael.

-Oh, God.

-Michael, I'm not--

Oh, no. Oh, no.

-Hey, hey.

-God, Donald. Oh, my God, no!

-I'll get you some water. Here.

-God, what have I done?

-Hey, stop it. Stop it.

-Jesus, God.

I'm gonna give you a Valium.

-No! Not pills and alcohol. I'm gonna die!

-I'm not…

Come on, take this. You're scaring me.

Stop that crying. Take this pill.

Come here.

Come here, Michael.

-Come here, Michael! Come here!

-Get off of me!

Jesus Christ.

-Hey.

It's okay.

It's okay.

It's okay.

Hey, it's okay.

It's okay.

Who was it that always used to say,

"Show me a happy homosexual, and I'll show you a gay corpse"?

I don't know.

Who was it who always used to say that?

If we could just not hate ourselves so much.

That's it, you know?

If we could just…

Oh. If we could just learn not to hate ourselves… quite so very much.

Yes, I know.

-I know.

Okay.

By the way,

I think your analyst is a quack.

-Earlier, you said he was a prick.

-That's right. He's a prick quack.

-Or a quack prick. Whichever you prefer.

-Okay.

Harold was right.

You'll never change.

You suppose there's any possibility of just flushing this place?

What time is it?

It's early.

Where are you going?

The bedroom's ocupado, and I don't want to go to sleep yet anyway.

I'm gonna try and walk off this booze.

If I went to sleep right now, when I woke up, they'd have to put me in a padded cell.

Not that that's where I don't belong.

There's a midnight mass over at St. Malachy's that all the show people go to. I th--

I think I'll walk over and catch it.

Well, pray for me.

Maybe they'll be gone when I get back.

Will I see you again next Saturday?

Unless you have other plans.

No.

- Michael.

-What?

Did he ever tell you why he was crying on the phone?

No.

It must have been that he'd left Fran.

Or maybe it was something else, and he changed his mind.

Maybe so.

I wonder why he left her.

As my father said to me when he died in my arms,

"I don't understand any of it."

"I never did."

Turn out the lights when you leave, will you?

What? Oh.
