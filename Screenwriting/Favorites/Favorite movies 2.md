# Drive my car





Occasionally, she sneaks into Yamaga's house.

¿Yamaga?

The name of her first love.

He's a high school classmate.

He's not aware of her love for him.

She doesn't want him to know, so that's OK with her.

But she wants to know more about him.

She wants to know everything about him, without letting him know about her.

So she sneaks in.

Right.

When he's attending classes, she feigns illness and leaves early.

Yamaga's an only child and his dad's an office worker.

His mom's a school teacher.

So the girl knows there's nobody at home during the day.

How does she sneak in?

She's just an ordinary teenager.

She takes a guess and searches under a potted plant by the front door.

There's a key.

What a careless family.

She uses it to let herself into the house.

She goes upstairs and opens a door.

The number on the soccer uniform on a hanger tells her it's his room.

The room is tidy for a 17-year-old boy, and she senses that he has controlling parents, his mom in particular.

She breathes in.

She listens carefully.

She hears silence.

An amplified silence, like the sound through a hearing aid, fills the room.

She lies down on Yamaga's bed.

She holds back the urge to masturbate.

Why? The limits of a television drama?

No.

She has her own set of rules.

Things she'll allow or won't allow herself to do.

She can sneak into his house, but not masturbate there.

Right.

Then she leaves an unused tampon in his room.

A tampon?

- That's what you said.

- That's so weird.

More so than usual.

Can this be adapted for TV?

Don't worry. The producer said it's for an innovative late-night slot.

If you say so.

So she takes out an unused tampon from her school bag and puts it in a drawer in his desk.

What if the overprotective mother finds him?

She feels a rush of excitement at the thought.

She's kinky.

The tampon is a token indicating she was really there.

A token.

She continues sneaking in  from time to time after that.

She's aware of the risks.

She's the type who is trusted by her parents and teachers, so a lot is at stake.

Nevertheless, she can't stop.

She can't stop.

She sniffs around in his room, longing for his slightest scent.

She always takes a token from his room when she leaves.

A pencil or something that he won't notice is gone.

And in exchange, she leaves a token of herself.

At her most daring moment, she took off her underwear and put it deep in his chest of drawers.

She feels that they are gradually mingling by exchanging such tokens.

And that she is giving him the strength to escape his mother's control.

That's it for today.

I see.

Want to know the rest?

Yeah, I do.

Shall I wait, or shall I write it? Which?

You can still wait.

Yeah. I want to know the rest, too.

You really don't know?

I never do, do I?

Well, I thought maybe this time it was about your first love.

Of course it's not!

Thank you.

- Hello.

- Hello.

When does the curtain go up?

6:30 p.m. Doors open at 6:00.

I'll be cutting it close.

Don't bother coming. You shouldn't slip out of a meeting.

I'll bother. I want to see your play.

- Break a leg.

- Thanks.

Not worth a curse.

(You say we have to come back tomorrow?)

Yes.

(Then we can bring a good bit of rope.)

That's it.

(Didi?)

Yes.

(I can't go on like this.)

That's what you think.

(If we parted?

That might be better for us.)

We'll hang ourselves tomorrow.

Unless Godot comes.

(And if he comes?)

We'll be saved.

(Well? Shall we go?)

Pull on your trousers.

(What?)

Pull on your trousers.

May I come in?

Come in.

What?

It was great.

Yeah? I'm glad.

May I introduce someone now?

Yeah, after I change...

Takatsuki.

Hi, I'm Takatsuki.

Your wife kindly invited me.

Don't say "wife."

I see you a lot on TV.

Thank you.

He's in my new one, too. A good role.

He always has a good role.

Better than ever.

He's the heroine's love interest.

Yes.

When I mentioned your play during the production meeting, he said he wanted to come.

I'd heard about your methods and was interested.

They're so different. Multilingual.

I'm not sure if this is the right sentiment, but it was moving.

Really? You're a strange young man.

Oto, please.

It's true.

Yes, thank you.

Don't thank me.

I need to change, so maybe later.

Excuse me.

Good work.

Sorry, did I wake you?

You must be tired.

My flight's Narita at 9:00, gotta run.

See you.

See you.

You didn't have to get up.

Here. Uncle Vanya..

I recorded it.

About time you need it, right?

Thanks.

You'll miss your flight.

See you. Take care.

See you.

Here, have some tea.

I don't feel like drinking tea.

How about vodka, then?

Nobody knows how I feel.

I can't sleep at night from frustration and anger.

I've wasted my time.

I could have attained so much from life, but it's too late now at this age.

Uncle Vanya, that's so boring.

You speak as if your former convictions were somehow to blame.

But your convictions were not at fault.

You were the one at fault.

NARITA AIRPORT

FLIGHT CANCELED DUE TO COLD SNAP. IT

WILL BE RESCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW.

THE THEATER FESTIVAL WILL

CONTINUE AS SCHEDULED,

AS WELL AS HIS JOB AS A JUDGE.

IF NECESSARY, STAY NEAR THE AIRPORT.

- Hi there.

- Hi. Did you get there all right?

Yeah.

Jury duty starts tomorrow?

Yeah.

How's your hotel? Comfy?

They're all the same.

Try any Vladivostok specialties?

What's the specialty?

I don't know, so I'm asking you.

How lazy.

A WEEK LATER

For 25 years he's been pretending to be someone he's not.

Look at that swagger, acting like he's some kind of lord.

You envy him, don't you?

Yes, I do. I envy him a lot.

Such good luck with women!

Don Juan himself couldn't have had more experience.

His first wife, who was my sister...

Hey.

What a relief.

I'm OK.

You're really all right?

I don't know yet.

They examined me.

Still waiting for the results.

Glaucoma in your left eye.

¿Glaucoma?

Damage to the optic nerve causing partial vision loss.

Loss of vision in one eye is hard to detect because the other eye adapts.

Which means that it doesn't impact daily activities, and by the time one notices it, it's often too late.

You were lucky it was diagnosed early.

Can I drive?

It's not impossible.

That means I can?

Yes, if your symptoms don't worsen.

How is it treated?

The root cause of glaucoma is still unknown, so it can't be cured.

The goal is to slow its progression.

These eye drops lower eye pressure.

You might doubt the effect, but you'll lose your vision if you stop using it.

Make sure you use them twice daily.

DIED FEBRUARY 25, 2001

You wanted to drive today, didn't you?

Why?

Well, you just got your car back.

I love you dearly, but...

What, all of a sudden?

There's one thing I can't stand.

What?

Your driving. 

Face forward.

Why didn't you change lanes just now?

Hey, that could be considered verbal harassment.

Honestly speaking... did you want kids again?

I don't know.

Nobody can take her place, after all.

But we could have loved them as much.

There's no use in me wanting something that you don't want.

I'm sorry.

It's not your fault.

I made that choice with you.

So it's all right.

I... really do love you so much.

Thanks.

I'm so glad you're with me.

One day, she remembers her previous existence.

You mean that girl who sneaks in?

She used to be a lamprey in her previous life.

A lamprey?

She was a noble lamprey.

She didn't leech off the fish that passed overhead like other lampreys did.

She fastened her suction cup-like mouth to a rock on the riverbed and did nothing but sway there.

Until she wasted away and really became like riverweed, she clung to the rock.

She doesn't remember how she died.

Did she starve to death?

Was she eaten by other fish?

All she remembers is swaying at the bottom of the river.

In Yamaga's room, she suddenly understands.

What she's doing here is the same.

She can't tear herself away from his room, just like how she clung to a rock.

Come to think of it, the silence in this room is very similar to under water.

Time stands still.

Past and present fade away.

And she... becomes a lamprey again.

She... begins to masturbate on Yamaga's bed.

She strips off all her clothes one layer at a time.

She'd forbidden herself from doing it, but now she can't stop.

Tears fall, wetting the pillow.

She thinks that those tears are her token for today.

Just then, someone comes home.

A door opens downstairs.

She notices then that it's starting to get dark outside the window.

Is it Yamaga?

Or his father?

His mother?

She hears that person coming up the stairs.

It's over.

But now, she can stop at last.

At last, it'll all end.

She can finally escape the karmic fate from her prior life.

She'll become a new person.

The door opens.

NEITHER EEL NOR FISH?: THE LAMPREY

Do you remember yesterday's story?

Sorry, I don't remember clearly.

I was pretty much asleep.

I see.

Sorry.

That just means it wasn't worth remembering.

I have to go.

You have plans today?

I'm teaching a workshop.

Didn't I tell you?

No.

Sorry.

Are you driving?

Yeah.

Sorry, I still had the keys.

Thank you.

Can you handle it?

- I'll be fine. See you...

- Yusuke.

When you return tonight, can we talk?

Of course. Why do you ask?

- Have a nice day.

- You too.

Is she faithful to him?

Yes, unfortunately.

Why unfortunately?

Because that woman's fidelity is a lie through and through.

There's an abundance of rhetoric, but no logic in it.

My life is lost, there's no turning back.

That thought haunts me like an evil spirit day and night.

My past went by without event.

It's unimportant.

But the present is worse.

What should I do about my life and my love?

What happened...

When you speak to me of love and romance,

I feel like I'm in a daze

and don't know what to say.

Oh, ho. The Lord have mercy.

Sonya.

I'm miserable.

If you only knew how miserable I am.

What can we do? We must live our lives.

Yes, we shall live, Uncle Vanya.

We'll live through the long, long days,

and through the long nights.

We'll patiently endure the trials that fate sends our way.

Even if we can't rest, we'll work for others

both now and when we have grown old.

And when our last hour comes

we'll go quietly.

And in the great beyond, we'll say to Him

that we suffered,

that we cried,

that life was hard...

Oto.

Oto.

Oto.

Hello?

Please send an ambulance.

OTO KAFUKU FUNERAL SERVICE

So sudden... a cerebral hemorrhage.

For 25 years he's been pretending to be someone he's not.

Look at that swagger, acting like he's some kind of lord.

(You envy him, don't you?)

Yes, I do. I envy him a lot.

His first wife, who was my sister, was a wonderful, kind woman.

And she loved him from the bottom of her heart, the way an untainted, noble human loves an angel.

And his second wife, as you can see, is a lovely, smart woman.

Why?

(Is she faithful to him?)

Yes, unfortunately.

(Why unfortunately?)

Because that woman's fidelity is a lie through and through.

(Vanya...)

(Don't talk like that.)

(Come on...)

(Shut up, Waffles.)

(No, I'll have my say. My wife took off with her lover on the day after our wedding, because I'm unattractive.)

TWO YEARS LATER

Of course...

I'm sure that

the truth,

no matter what it is, isn't that frightening.

What is most frightening is not knowing it.

HIROSHIMA THEATER

OF ARTS AND CULTURE

- Are you tired after the long trip?

- Not at all.

Long time no see, Ms. Yuzuhara.

Let me introduce you. Yoon-su will participate as the dramaturge.

We've exchanged e-mails.

As we explained over e-mail, your residency will be for 2 months until December, starting today.

6 weeks of rehearsals and

2 weeks of performances.

Auditions will already begin tomorrow.

Here are the audition sheets.

Thank you.

We informed theaters around Asia, and received applications from Korea,

China, Hong Kong,

Taiwan, and the Philippines.

Yes.

I'll interpret Korean.

People who can speak English will communicate with you directly.

Yes.

Actors from overseas were recommended by the local theaters' program directors.

And we also received many applications from within Japan.

Even I recognize some faces.

I'll have a look. Can't wait.

Now let's go to your residence.

We found a place about an hour away by car, just like you requested.

Thank you.

On a scenic island, since you're here.

An island, huh?

Also, we've hired a driver for you according to our rules.

So our driver will be handling your car, is that all right?

About that... I'll drive my own car.

I've got insurance.

Please don't mind me.

This isn't about hospitality, actually.

We can't let you drive.

What do you mean?

An artist ran over a person by accident in the past.

Yes.

It was terrible. Since then, it's become the rule to provide a driver for our resident artists, no exceptions.

I go over my lines while I'm driving.

It's an important routine for me.

That's why I asked you to book a hotel some distance away.

We're sorry.

We should have explained to you more clearly.

There's a budget set aside for it, so the theater festival has to use it.

If it concerns you, you're welcome to test our driver.

But don't worry, the driver is very skilled.

Let's go.

Thank you for your understanding.

I'll follow you in the official car.

She's your driver.

I'm Misaki Watari.

This is Mr. Kafuku, our stage director.

The festival hires her every year.

She knows the roads well.

She's an excellent driver.

Nice to meet you.

Sorry, but I still haven't agreed to having you as my driver.

Is a test drive OK with you?

Yes, of course.

No, I'll drive after all.

I'm sorry.

Is it because I'm a young woman?

That's not why.

This car is pretty old and has quirks.

It's not easy the first time.

Very well.

Then if you sense any danger in my driving, you take the wheel.

How does that sound?

Do you prefer the passenger seat?

Any problems with the electrical components?

No, none.

Sorry, but you said it was an old car, so I had to make sure.

I've driven it 15 years and no problems.

I see.

Could you play the cassette tape?

The cassette tape?

Yes.

I'm leaving.

Vanya, please just drop it.

Do you hear me?

I refuse.

Wait, I'm not done yet.

You destroyed my life.

I've never lived.

Because of you,

I wasted the best years of my life and spoiled them.

You're my foe. My bitter enemy.

You fool..

If this estate is yours, then take it,

I don't want it.

I'm leaving right now.

This is like hell.

I can't stand it.

I'm gifted and intelligent.

Courageous, too.

If I'd lived normally, I might have been another Schopenhauer or Dostoevsky.

I'm sick of this nonsense.

I'm losing my mind.

Mother, I can't take it anymore.

Listen to the professor.

Mother, what should I do?

No, never mind. Don't say anything.

I know what to do.

I'll make you pay for this.

Oh, I'll do it.

What do you think?

The Setouchi sea is tranquil and lovely.

Her driving, I mean.

I'll come pick you up at 8 a.m. tomorrow morning.

OK. Sorry it's so early.

No problem.

AUDITION PROFILE FOR "UNCLE VANYA"

Shall I play the tape?

Yes, please.

Uncle, are you crying?

I'm not crying. It's nothing.

Don't be ridiculous.

Your eyes when you looked at me now looked exactly like your dead mother.

Oh, Sonya. Your mother, my sister, where is she now?

You've been ill for such a long time.

Sonya's mother Vera used to stay awake at night for you, too.

She must have been so worried.

(Let's go, Marina.)

Hey, I haven't finished my lines yet.

Oh, well.

My own feet are in pain as well.

Such a throbbing pain.

Well, thank you very much.

Next, please.

Next one please.

Excuse me.

Hello, my name is Janice Chang.

I am from Taiwan and my native language is Mandarin.

My audition is for Yelena.

Koshi Takatsuki.

I'm trying out for Astrov.

The two of you have chosen lines from the same scene so you will be auditioning as a pair.

You both requested the same scene, so enact it as a pair.

Yes.

So she's Yelena, and where from?

From "You are a cunning woman."

Okay.

From "You are a cunning woman."

Sure.

I don't understand what she's saying.

Is it OK if I try to wing it?

Yes, go ahead. Whenever you're ready.

When you are ready.

Oh, you are a cunning woman!

(What do you mean?)

How cunning you are!

Assuming Sonya is suffering, let's set that aside for now.

But...

(What are you saying?)

You know perfectly well why I come here every day.

You know why and for whose sake I come!

You're a tigress!

- My sweet...

- (A tigress?)

(What do you mean?)

A sleek, enchanting tigress...

You must have your victims!

(Are you out of your mind?)

How coy you are.

(I'm not the kind of woman you think I am.)

(I swear I'm not that vulgar.)

No need to swear. Don't waste words.

You're so beautiful.

Such lovely hands.

(Enough of this!)

Listen to me.

This is fate, it's inevitable.

(Please stop this.)

(Let go of me.)

Meet me in the forest tomorrow.

At 2 o'clock.

All right? Be there.

Be there, OK?

(Let me go!)

That's enough. Sorry about that.

Thanks.

The next person is the last one.

She's a bit different.

(Come in.)

She's Lee Yoon-A.

She's saying she uses

Korean sign language.

You understand it?

Yes.

(Nobody else chose this scene, so you'll audition alone.)

She can hear.

I'll translate in Korean if necessary.

Will that be OK?

Yes.

(Please begin.)

Uncle Vanya, did you take the morphine?

Give it back.

Why do you make us worry?

Give it back, Uncle Vanya.

My misfortune could perhaps be greater than yours, but I don't give in to despair.

Until my life comes to a natural end,

I'll keep enduring it.

So, you must endure yours, too.

My dear and only Uncle.

Please.

Give it back.

Have pity on us.

You must endure your sorrow.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Not too many auditioned for the part of Vanya.

You're right.

Everyone probably thinks you'll be playing the role.

VANYA

Sorry, it's so late.

No problem.

Good morning.

Everyone here passed the audition.

However, some of you are assigned to the parts  that were not your preferred role.

He will announce the cast list.

You can sign your contract if you accept your assigned role.

Serebryakov, Roy Lucelo.

Yelena, Janice Chang.

Sonya, Lee Yoon-A.

Voynitskaya, Kaoru Komagata.

Vanya,

Koshi Takatsuki.

Astrov, Ryu Jeong-Eui.

Telegin, Takashi Kimura.

Marina, Yumi Eto.

That's all.

Excuse me.

You want me to play Vanya?

Yes.

There's quite an age-gap.

You can wear make-up. Everyone's role doesn't match their actual age.

If you're unwilling, then don't sign.

The role will go to someone else.

When you finish signing, we'll start reading the script.

Congratulations.

(Superb.)

(How wonderful.)

(What a stunning view.)

The view is indeed wonderful, your Excellency.

Mr. Kimura, please say it slower.

- Slower than that?

- Yes.

And enunciate more clearly so that everyone can hear.

Okay.

Continue.

The view is indeed wonderful, your Excellency.

Tomorrow we shall go into the woods.

Shall we, papa?

Ladies and gentlemen, tea is ready.

(If you don't mind...)

(Hush, someone will hear you.)

No, let me say that I love you.

Don't drive me away.

That's all I need to be happy.

(I can't stand this.)

Thank you. Let's stop here for today.

Thank you. Let's stop here for today.

Good work.

Aren't you cold?

Not at all.

From now on...

Yes?

Could you wait in the car when I'm running late?

I feel uncomfortable knowing you're waiting in the cold.

No, thank you.

I know you cherish this car, so I can't relax.

If you know that, then it's no problem.

Just smoke outside.

Fine, then. Only when it's really too cold.

Shall I play the tape?

Yes.

But allow me, as an old man, give one word of advice before parting.

Everyone,

the important thing is to work.

You must keep working.

Mr. Kafuku.

Could I invite you out for a drink?

My car is here, too.

You're driving?

Yes, so if you don't mind, how about the bar at my hotel?

I'll be a bit late.

No problem.

Good.

I'll bring my car around, then.

Please follow me.

I actually sometimes do a search on your name online.

That's how I found this audition, and that day was the deadline.

Isn't that amazing?

Why are you interested in me?

I really liked acting out

Oto's screenplays.

Saying her lines made me happy.

My theater projects and Oto's screenplays are different things.

Yes.

But when I saw your play that time,

I felt that what you two were doing were the same, albeit in different ways.

How so?

Tough question.

I get the feeling that you both value the finer details that people won't even notice.

I actually like things like that.

But I wouldn't have known if I hadn't acted out Oto's scripts.

When I saw the casting call,

I knew this was my only chance.

I'm not sure if you know, but I'm working freelance now.

I know. Though in my case

I didn't have to look you up.

Is that so.

That's embarrassing.

How stupid.

You were a star.

No, I was framed.

Do you do things like that often?

Things like what?

With women you barely know.

Don't you?

No.

Lots of women must approach you, too.

All you have to do is say no.

I don't do it with just anybody, either.

If you click and want to get to know her better... Not ever?

Sex isn't the only way to get to know someone.

But some things you can't know unless you do it.

- Like what?

- Like...

What's the matter?

Just that... why am I talking to you about this?

Oto must have been happy with a husband like you.

I wonder.

If you don't mind, could you tell me something about her?

Something about her?

How you two met, how she wrote her screenplays, everyday conversations. Anything.

Here's what you're thinking.

"He and I share the same pain, because..."

"we loved the same woman."

Oh please. Mine was just an unrequited longing.

You were in love with her.

I don't deny it.

She was lovely. Very much so.

Yeah.

So I'm jealous of you, Mr. Kafuku.

Forgive me.

You're jealous... of me?

Excuse me.

You took a picture, didn't you?

You took one just now.

Delete it.

What's the matter with you?

I'm leaving now.

Yes.

- The check, please.

- Yes, sir.

I'm sorry.

I invited you today.

It's Okay.

I'm glad to be here now, to be able to perform under your direction.

I believe Oto brought us together.

I look forward to working with you again from tomorrow.

Yeah. See you tomorrow.

What's the matter? You look so glum.

Is it because you feel sorry for that professor?

Leave me alone.

(Or because you're in love with his wife?)

She's a good friend of mine.

(Already?)

What do you mean by "already"?

Stop.

Still too much emotion?

Ryu is doing it right. Emulate him.

Continue.

Please continue.

(There's a proper order for a woman to become a man's friend.)

(First, she's an acquaintance,)

(then she's a lover, and finally, she becomes a good friend.)

What a coarse philosophy.

Takatsuki.

Try focusing on your text.

All you have to do is read it.

You just have to read it.

We're not robots.

What do you mean?

Of course we'll follow all of your instructions.

But we're not robots. And I think we'll do  better if we know what your intent is.

You don't have to do better.

Just simply read the text.

From where we left off, then.

Let's pick up from where we left off.

(What? Yes...)

(I admit that I have becoming coarse.)

(You see, I'm drunk too.)

(I usually get this drunk once a month.)

I didn't get him? I missed again?

Damn it.

God damn it.

(Get me out of here.

Kill me if you must.)

(I can't stay here anymore.)

What's wrong with me?

What am I doing?

Nurse, nurse.

Scene

Okay. 

That's it for today.

That's all for today.

Good work.

Mr. Kafuku.

Could we do a little interview for the festival website?

We need a video, so somewhere outside

All we do is read the text.

When will we start moving?

Honestly, the foreign language parts lull me to sleep.

- Me too!

- Me too.

- Though not in a bad way.

- Yeah, it's like hearing a sutra.

Sounds like a blessing when you put it that way.

Yoon-su, where did you learn Japanese?

I studied Noh in graduate school at Waseda University for 2 years.

Korean, English, Japanese, and sign language. That's amazing.

Japanese and Korean have similar grammar so learning the vocabulary is enough.

I've liked English from a young age.

When did you learn sign language?

Mr. Kafuku, you kindly offered to take me home.

May I invite you over for dinner today?

No, I don't want to intrude.

There's something I have to apologize to you about.

- What is it?

- You'll know when we get there.

Both of you, please come inside.

Let's go. He probably doesn't feel comfortable making you wait hungry.

There's no need to worry about that.

I wouldn't worry. But I'm sure he will.

Let's go.

My wife.

She says it looks like me.

How rude!

These potatoes are from the back yard. She grew them.

This is what I wanted to apologize to you about.

Why didn't you tell me?

She worried you might find it hard to reject her if you knew she was my wife.

No, I...

You wouldn't mind, I can tell.

But silence is golden.

To answer your question, I learned sign language after meeting her.

I wanted to know her language so I learned it.

That's really something.

She's originally a dancer, and I was the coordinator when her dance company performed in Busan.

Love at first sight.

Don't tell her.

Why Hiroshima?

I was invited to the theater festival

3 years ago.

And Yoon-A came with you?

Yes. When I got the offer, I debated whether or not she should come along.

In Korea, she has family and friends who know sign language.

I thought she would be lonely here.

But I figured I could listen to her as if I were a hundred people.

I felt that I'm the only one who could support her.

Why did you decide to audition?

"I got pregnant and took time off from dancing,"

"but had a miscarriage."

"Although I wanted to work again, my body refused to dance."

"That was when my husband told me about you and suggested I try it."

Thank you.

Is there anything hard about rehearsals?

"Why do you ask me something you don't ask others?"

"You don't have to be nicer to me than you are to other people.

"People not understanding my words is normal for me."

"But I can see and hear."

"Sometimes I can understand a lot more than words."

"That's what's important in our rehearsals, right?"

Yes.

"So right now, every day is so much fun."

"Chekhov's text comes inside me and"

"moves my body that was stuck before."

"I'm glad I got my courage up."

Glad to hear that.

Do you like spicy food?

Yes. It's good.

How's her driving?

It's fabulous.

She speeds up and slows down so smoothly, I hardly feel gravity.

Sometimes I forget I'm in a car.

I've experienced many people's driving, but it's never been so pleasant.

I'm glad she was assigned as my driver is how I feel now.

"Compliment us actors as much for once," she says.

This means, "to compliment"?

Yes.

Thanks for inviting me..

It was Yoon-su who invited us.

They were a lovely couple.

Yes.

Now I'm curious about your rehearsals.

Yoon-A's Sonya.

I've been hearing your tape, so I kept thinking, "She's Sonya."

You're welcome to watch.

No, thank you. I'm sorry.

- Come watch us...

- Shall I play the tape?

Yeah.

Vanya, you're educated and intelligent,

so you must surely understand

that the world isn't destroyed by villains...

Don't you get sick of hearing this?

No.

I like this voice is why.

I see.

Whose voice is it?

My wife.

The flow of the entire play has to be memorized with my method.

So I listen to it over and over.

I acted in Uncle Vanya before, so Vanya's parts are left out.

When I say my line at my pace, the next line starts precisely.

Wow.

What I said before is true.

I forget that I'm in the car and forget that you're here.

Annoying, isn't it?

No, it's your job.

Where did you learn to drive?

My hometown.

Kami-junitaki Village in Hokkaido, where you need a car to do anything.

Ah.

My mother taught me to drive, and I've done it since junior high.

Junior high?

Yes.

My mother worked at a nightclub in Sapporo.

She took a train there, so ever since junior high

I drove her to and from our local station.

The station was an hour away.

We left the house at 5 p.m. and I picked her up at 7 a.m.

During those two hours, my mother wanted to sleep.

If I woke her with my driving, she'd kick me in the back and hit me when we arrived.

That's how

I learned to drive over bad roads without waking her

I see.

What you said made me very happy.

No.

I'm grateful to my mother for teaching me how to drive.

It was for her own sake, but the way she taught me was thorough.

I see.

Yes.

No doubt it must have been so.

Will you tell me the whole truth afterwards?

Yes, of course.

I'm sure that

the truth,

no matter what it is, isn't that frightening.

What is most frightening

is not knowing it.

Oh, to flirt with a man like him

and to lose oneself in his arms.

I guess...

I'm a bit in love with him too.

Yes, I miss him when he doesn't come...

(My conscience tortures me)

(as if I'd killed that man.)

(I sit down, and...)

(close my eyes like this, and think...)

(Will the people living 200 or

300 years from now,)

(the ones we're currently clearing the way for,)

(will they remember us and be grateful?)

(They'll all completely forget.)

People might forget, but God will surely commend you.

(Thanks. That's good to know.)

Okay!

Sorry we're late.

Either Vanya or Yelena is in most scenes.

We kept repeating the same ones and started the walk-through.

I'm very sorry.

It was for the best, actually.

Why don't you two move a bit as well?

My life is lost, there's no turning back.

That thought haunts me like an evil spirit day and night.

My past went by without event.

It's unimportant.

But the present is worse.

What should I do about my life and my love?

What happened?

(You say such things, but I don't know...)

(what to do.)

(I'm sorry is all I can say.)

(Forgive me. Good night.)

Please understand...

Stop.

What did you think of your performance?

What do you think?

I think the director should  be the one to judge.

Terrible.

I agree with you.

I feel like we both did better during the auditions.

Hm, do you know why?

Because I've learned a little bit of the dialogue dialogues so I use my partner like my acting cues.

But if I don't learn the dialogue, I can't act.

Okay.

And I thought that this way I could  pay more attention to other people's emotions.

If I learned the dialogue perfectly,  including theirs

I can react better.

I see.

Why don't we read the book again?

From the beginning of Act Two.

From the beginning of the Second Act.

Can I record the dialogue?

Of course.

Okay.

You may begin.

(Who's there?)

(Is it you, Sonya?)

(It's me.)

(Lenochka...)

(the pain's intolerable!)

(Your blanket's fallen on the floor.)

I'll shut the window...

Mr. Kafuku.

I'm very sorry about today.

Never mind.

I was just lending her an ear.

You say that, but you can't speak

English or Mandarin.

She doesn't speak Japanese.

Right.

So we ended up...

Use good judgment.

I'm sorry.

That's all I have to say.

Could you keep driving somewhere?

Somewhere?

I still haven't seen much of Hiroshima.

Some place you like is fine.

All right.

Isn't it kind of like snow?

Straight down that way is the Peace Memorial Park.

The line between the A-Bomb Dome and the

Cenotaph is called the "axis of peace."

The architect who designed this facility created this atrium so that the line would continue on to the sea without being severed.

Why did you come to Hiroshima?

Wait, never mind.

Behind our house was a hill.

5 years ago, a landslide occurred and our house was destroyed by the debris.

My mother died in that accident.

I'd turned 18 years old right before then, and had just officially obtained my driver's license.

The car was intact, so I left home in it after her funeral.

So you're 23 years old now.

Yes.

I had nowhere to go, so I just kept heading out west.

But my car broke down in Hiroshima, and I had no money to fix it.

So I began driving those garbage trucks.

Driving is the only thing I can do.

Do you plan on staying here?

I don't know.

My last name, Watari, is from my father, and it's common in Shimane and Hiroshima.

Though I've never met him and don't even know if he's alive.

I see.

Your last name, Kafuku, is uncommon, isn't it?

Written, "house" and "good luck."

It's auspicious.

My wife said the same thing before we married.

Oh.

My wife's name is Oto.

Oto.

Oto, as in "sound."

Oto Kafuku. What a name.

The primary reason why she hesitated marrying me.

Her name would be "House of the Gospel."

She died 2 years ago.

Cerebral hemorrhage.

She was on the floor when I got home, and never regained consciousness.

Does that tape creep you out now?

No, not at all.

In fact, it's...

Sorry!

Thank you!

I like that car.

I can tell it's been treated with care, so I also want to drive it with care.

Let's go.

There must be something.

I can't take this.

I'm 47 years old.

If I live to be 60, that's

13 years I have before me.

That's so long.

How am I supposed to live out those 13 years?

Such nice weather.

Yes.

Let's do it over there.

(Why are you crying?)

I don't know. It's nothing.

I just started tearing up.

(Never mind. Silly, now I'm crying too.)

(You're angry with me because)

(you think I married your father for selfish reasons.)

(I don't know if you'll believe me,)

(but I swear to you,)

(I married him for love.)

(I was infatuated with the famous professor.)

(I know now that the love was fake and not real,)

(but it seemed real at the time.)

(I couldn't help it.)

(But you've glared at me disapprovingly)

(with those clever, suspicious eyes ever since our marriage.)

Stop, stop. We made up.

Let's forget the past.

(Don't look at others like that.)

(It doesn't suit you.)

(You should trust people, or else life becomes impossible.)

Hey.

Tell me honestly.

Are you happy?

(No.)

(I wish you happiness)

(from the bottom of my heart.)

(As for me, I'm unimportant, like an accessory.)

(In music, in my husband's house, in romance...)

(No matter where I am,)

(I'm just an accessory.)

(To be honest,)

(Sonya...)

(Come to think of it, I'm very unhappy.)

(Happiness for me doesn't exist in this world.)

(Why are you laughing?)

I'm happy.

I'm just so happy.

(I want to play the piano now.)

Do play.

I'd love to hear from you.

Okay.

Something happened just now.

But it's still just between actors.

There's the next step.

We open it up to the audience.

We recreate that moment onstage in its entirety.

Let's do Act 3, too.

Takatsuki.

Yes.

It's freezing.

Yes.

Thank you for today.

About what?

Nothing.

Could we talk?

If you don't mind, somewhere nearby.

Just for a bit.

Where's your car?

It's being repaired.

About today... what happened?

Between Janice and Yoon-A.

Only they know the answer to that.

One thing I can say is that this text has the power to make that happen.

Mr. Kafuku, why aren't you playing Vanya yourself?

Chekhov is terrifying.

When you say his lines, it drags out the real you.

Don't you feel it?

I can't bear that anymore.

Which means I can no longer yield myself up to this role.

But then, why me?

I feel out of place in this production.

I'm not suited for this role.

I'm sure the audience will feel the same way.

When I auditioned, I was desperate and in shambles.

I didn't know what I was doing.

So why did you choose me?

Oto brought us together.

Please don't be glib. I'm serious.

I came here to change myself.

You can't control yourself very well.

Right.

From a social standpoint, that's not good.

But it's not necessarily a drawback for an actor.

During your audition and our sessions, you weren't bad.

You can yield yourself to your cast mate.

Do the same to the text.

Yield yourself and respond to the text.

¿Respond to it?

The text is questioning you.

If you listen to it and respond, the same will happen to you.

Go on ahead.

I'll take you to your hotel.

Check, please.

Thank you.

Mr. Kafuku offered to take me to my hotel.

OK, the same as before?

I'll go pay for parking.

Where's Takatsuki?

Sorry, let's go.

Mr. Kafuku.

I'm empty.

There's nothing inside me.

About the text questioning me...

I think I felt that with Oto's screenplays.

I came here because

I wanted to feel it again.

So... that bit about Oto bringing us together is true after all.

I finally understand.

Oto and I...

Yes.

We had a daughter.

She died from pneumonia when she was four.

She'd be 23 if she were alive.

Our daughter's death marked the end of our happy times.

Oto quit acting.

I quit working in TV and returned to theater.

Oto was lethargic for years.

But then she suddenly began writing stories one day.

No, she began telling them.

Her first story... was born after having sex with me.

She suddenly started narrating it after having sex.

But the next morning, her memory was foggy.

I remembered it all, so I told her.

She wrote a script based on it and sent it to a contest.

It won an award and launched her career as a screenwriter.

"That" would strike her at times after sex.

She'd tell it to me and make me remember it.

The next morning, I'd tell her.

She'd take notes.

Eventually that became our custom.

Sex and her stories were strongly connected.

Even if it didn't seem like it.

She'd grasp a thread of a story from the edge of orgasm and spin it.

That's how she used to write.

Not all the time.

But whenever her career hit a wall,

"that" would strike.

Those stories... became a bond that helped us overcome our child's death.

I think we were a compatible couple.

We needed each other to get through life.

Everyday living and our sex life were very fulfilling.

At least they were for me.

But...

Oto saw other men.

She's fine, don't worry.

Oto slept with other men.

Not just one.

Probably with the actors who were cast in the dramas she wrote.

Each relationship ended with the drama, and another would begin when another drama started.

Do you have evidence?

I've witnessed them before.

She sometimes brought them into our home.

Even so, I've never doubted her love for me.

There was no doubt.

Oto betrayed me so naturally while she loved me.

We were definitely deeply bonded, more so than anyone.

Still, she contained within her a spot that I couldn't look into, where something dark swirled.

Didn't you ever ask her about any of this?

What I feared most was losing her..

If she found out I knew, we wouldn't have been able to maintain our balance.

Isn't it possible that she wanted you to hear her out?

Did Oto tell you something?

May I tell you a story she told me?

Yes.

It's a very mysterious tale.

A high school girl sneaks into the home of a boy she likes.

I've heard that one, too.

The girl who was a lamprey in her past life.

That's how it is.

She sneaks in multiple times and leaves a token of herself each time.

One day, she starts masturbating on Yamaga's bed.

Someone comes home, but the story ends without telling who it was.

No.

It doesn't end there.

You know what happens next?

Yes.

Who was it, then?

Who came up the stairs?

Another intruder.

Another one?

Yes.

It wasn't Yamaga, or his father, or his mother.

Just a burglar.

The burglar finds her half naked in the room and attempts to rape her.

She takes a pen lying around and stabs the man in the left eye.

She struggles desperately, and stabs the pen in his temple, in his neck, over and over.

She notices the man has gone limp.

She has killed the burglar.

She washes the blood off in the shower and goes home.

The token she left in Yamaga's room that day was the burglar's corpse.

The next morning, she goes to school prepared to confess everything to Yamaga and face his judgment.

But Yamaga looks the same as usual at school that day.

She sees him play soccer after school seemingly carefree as always.

Things are the same the next day.

Nothing has changed. What became of that body in Yamaga's house?

Did she just imagine what happened?

She goes to Yamaga's house but nothing seems out of the ordinary.

Except for one thing...

A surveillance camera has been set up by the front door.

To not appear guilty, she walks past his house without stopping.

Something terrible had happened, and she was to blame, but the world seemed serene as if nothing had changed.

However, the world had definitely changed to something sinister.

She turns back.

"I..."

"must take responsibility for what I've done."

"I can't pretend it didn't happen."

"Because it definitely happened."

"I definitely killed that man."

She searches under the planter but the key is no longer there.

She stares at the surveillance camera.

Because it's the only change she has elicited in this world.

She looks into the lens and repeats her words over and over.

Clearly, so that she's understood,

"I killed him.

I killed him.

I killed him".

This is as far as I know.

Maybe the tale ends there, or maybe it continues.

The story leaves a bad taste, but even so, when I heard it from her,

I felt that Oto had handed me something important.

Mr. Kafuku.

As far as I know,

Oto was a really lovely woman.

Of course, what I know must be a tiny fraction of what you know about her.

But I still think so with certainty.

You lived with such a lovely person for over 20 years, and you should be grateful about that. That's my opinion.

But even if you think you know someone well, even if you love that person deeply, you can't completely look into that person's heart.

You'll just feel hurt.

But if you put in enough effort, you should be able to look into your own heart pretty well.

So in the end, what we should be doing is to be true to our hearts and come to terms with it in a capable way.

If you really want to look at someone, then your only option is to look at yourself squarely and deeply.

That's what I think.

You can go now.

It didn't sound like he was lying.

I don't know if it's the truth, but he was telling you what was true to him.

I can tell.

Because I grew up among liars.

I had to discern it or

I couldn't survive.

Are you sure?

Yeah.

See, there they go again!

Those vulgar geese!

Acting so boorishly!

(Stop that man!

He's gone mad!)

- (Give it to me!)

- Let me go, Yelena, let me go!

Where is he?

Aha, there he is!

(¡No!)

I didn't get him?

I missed again?

Damn it!

God damn it!

(Get me out of here!)

What is wrong with me?

(Kill me if you must.

I can't stay here anymore!)

What am I doing?

Okay.

If you do it the way you did it,

Vanya would be able to kill Serebryakov.

And that would change the story.

Takatsuki, that was good.

- Takatsuki...

- Excuse me.

What...?

I'm Kato, Hiroshima North Police.

Excuse me.

¿ Koshi Takatsuki?

Yes.

Could we speak someplace else?

Here is fine.

On Sunday, November 24, at around 7:30 p.m., you got into a fight and beat up a man in Shintenchi Park.

Is that correct?

You were caught on camera.

That man died in the hospital yesterday.

Yes, I saw the news.

I did it. That's correct.

Come with us to the police station.

- May I change?

- Yes.

HIROSHIMA NORTH POLICE

The lawyer... says that Mr. Takatsuki admits to the charge of injury resulting in death.

Can I see him?

Not now.

More importantly, what shall we do about the play?

Must we think about that now?

Yes. It's something we must think about.

We have two choices..

We cancel it, or you act in it.

I can't do that.

You know all the lines.

Vanya in Japanese like Takatsuki would be the least disruptive.

Yoon-su.

Why are we discussing this now?

I can't do it.

Then let's cancel.

Is that all right?

Give me some time.

We can wait 2 days.

That's the limit.

I understand.

I'll get back to you.

Do you know of a place where...

I can think in peace?

Oh.

I'll drive you somewhere.

Kami-junitaki Village.

Are you willing to show me the place where you grew up?

There's nothing there.

If that's OK with you.

I don't mind.

I'll take the wheel at some point.

We should take turns to get there in a day.

No taking turns.

Why not?

Because driving is my job.

I can go without sleeping for a day.

Thank you.

You can rest a bit more.

I can sleep on the ferry.

I see.

The day Oto died...

She asked before I left if we could talk when I got home.

Her tone was gentle but determined.

I had no plans that day, but kept on driving.

I couldn't go home.

I thought that once I went home, we would never be the same again.

I found her collapsed when I returned late at night.

I called an ambulance, but she never regained consciousness.

What if I'd gone home a bit earlier?

I think so every day.

I... killed my mother.

When the landslide crushed our home,

I was inside, too.

I was able to crawl out from the fallen house.

After escaping, I gazed at the half-collapsed house for a while.

Then some more debris came falling and completely destroyed it.

My mother was found dead under the debris.

I knew she was still in the house.

I don't know why I didn't call for help, or why I didn't save her.

I hated her, but that wasn't the only thing I felt about her.

This scar on my cheek is from that accident.

I was told surgery could make it less conspicuous, but I don't feel like erasing it.

If I were your father

I'd hold you round the shoulders and say,

"It's not your fault."

"You did nothing wrong.".

But I can't say that.

You killed your mother, and I killed my wife.

Yes.

... altercation with Kazuya Yamauchi of Hiroshima

and assaulted him, repeatedly punching him in the face.

Yamauchi was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead.

Koshi Takatsuki is an actor who has appeared in many dramas and movies,

but after reports of his relationship with a minor broke last year,

he worked independently, quitting his management company in January.

Good morning.

FLOWERS AND VEGETABLES FOR SALE

Is this where you....

Probably.

It's changed a lot.

Could we go up there?

That's our house.

My mother had a separate personality named Sachi.

Sachi.

Yes.

She first appeared when I was 14.

She said she was 8 years old, but she never aged in 4 years.

Sachi would often appear after my mother beat me up terribly.

It was like her awareness didn't match the body of an adult, so she couldn't move well.

She'd try to walk but fall over, and would end up just sitting still.

Sachi liked puzzle rings.

We did crosswords together.

Sachi cried a lot for no reason.

Whenever she did, I'd hold her and rub her back over and over.

I liked those times.

The last beautiful thing in my mother was condensed in Sachi.

Sachi was my only friend.

I don't know if my mother was mentally ill, or if she was acting to keep me close to her..

But even if she were acting, it was from the bottom of her heart.

Becoming Sachi was my mother's way of surviving in a hellish reality,

I think.

When that landslide occurred,

I knew that my mother's death meant that Sachi would die, too.

Even so...

I didn't move.

It's dirty.

Mr. Kafuku, about Oto...

Would it be hard for you to accept her, everything about her, as genuine?

Maybe there was nothing mysterious about her.

Would it be hard to think that she was simply like that?

That she loved you dearly and that she sought other men constantly don't seem to contradict each other or sound deceptive to me.

Is that strange?

I'm sorry.

I... should have been hurt properly.

I let something genuine slip by.

I was so deeply hurt.

To the point of distraction.

But... because...

I pretended not to notice it.

I didn't listen to myself.

So I lost Oto.

Forever.

Now I see.

I want to see Oto.

If I do, I want to yell at her.

Berate her.

For lying to me all the time.

I want to apologize.

For not listening.

For not being strong.

I want her back.

I want her to live

I want to talk to her just once more.

I want to see her.

But it's too late.

There's no turning back.

There's nothing I can do.

Those who survive keep thinking about the dead.

In one way or another, that will continue.

You and I must keep living like that.

We must keep on living.

It'll be OK.

I'm sure we'll be OK.

I refuse! Wait, I'm not done yet!

You destroyed my life.

I've never lived.

Because of you, I wasted the best years of my life and spoiled them.

You're my foe. My bitter enemy!

I can't stand it.

(But what do you want?)

I'm going.

(What earthly right have you to use such language to me?)

(You fool!)

(If this estate is yours, then take it,

I don't care!)

(This is like hell. I can't stand it.

I'm leaving now.)

I'm gifted and intelligent.

Courageous, too.

If I'd lived normally, I might have been another Schopenhauer or Dostoevsky.

I'm sick of this nonsense!

I'm losing my mind!

Mother, I can't take it anymore!

Listen to the professor!

Mother, what should I do?

No, never mind. Don't say anything.

I know what to do.

I'll make you pay for this!

¡Jean!

Sonya.

I'm miserable.

If you only knew how miserable I am.

What can we do?

We must live our lives.

Yes, we shall live, Uncle Vanya.

We'll live through the long, long days,

and through the long nights.

We'll patiently endure the trials that fate sends our way.

Even if we can't rest,

we'll continue to work for others

both now and when we have grown old.

And when our last hour comes

we'll go quietly.

And in the great beyond, we'll say to Him

that we suffered,

that we cried,

that life was hard.

And God...

will have pity on us.

Then you and I...

we'll see that bright, wonderful,

dreamlike life before our eyes.

We shall rejoice, and

with tender smiles on our faces,

we'll look back on our current sorrow.

And then at last,

we shall rest.

I believe it.

I strongly believe it from the bottom of my heart.

When that time comes,

we shall rest.

Furs are one thing, but there's a precious oil in the beavers, too.

That's worth something in China.

They use it for medicine over there.

If a man could take a batch of that precious beaver oil on a ship to Canton, he could make his fortune.

Why don't you?

Eh, oil is in the glands.

Glands never make it back to the fort, just rot away in the woods.

Anyway, I don't have contacts in Canton.

Where did you learn to do that?

I was indentured to a baker in Boston, sir.

He taught me the trade.

- He was a good baker.

- Indeed, he was.

What was his name?

Barnaby Rose.

Never heard of him.

But I commend you, sir, on these delicious baked comestibles.

I hope you won't be leaving too soon.

We have no plans.

Very, very good.

A hotel in San

Francisco is harder... more competition.

Eh, but more opportunity, too, more people coming through.

It's good idea.

We'll have enough to go there soon.

We have enough to go now.

Enough to go, but not enough to start.

Psst.

Psst!

Another cup is another dozen cakes.

That's another 60 silver pieces at least.

Hello?

Good evening. Back again.

I-I'm entertaining, uh, a small group next week.

Captain Ruby is coming for tea, and I'm tired of all his jests about the savagery of life on the frontier.

Tell me.

Do you know what a clafoutis is?

- I do.

- Hmm...

And could you make one, a-a good one?

He loves a clafoutis, and, well, I-

I'd like to humiliate him.

Well, without fresh raspberries or apricots, I'm not sure.

Have you tried bilberry?

It's out of season, I believe.

We have plenty of blueberries on the bush.

I-I would pay you handsomely for a proper blueberry clafoutis.

It's a simple enough recipe.

If blueberry is available,

I'm sure I can make one.

Capital.

Saturday, then, a clafoutis, and we'll be dining at my residence. You know its whereabouts?

Uh, uh, I think I've passed by it or I know of it.

Teatime.

The hotels in San

Francisco are grand.

We can't compete on that scale... and regular travelers need shelter, too.

A room with a bed, that's all.

A few rooms near the sea.

This is a dangerous game we're playing here.

And Chief Factor has a delicate palate.

He'll taste his milk in there eventually.

I can't say no.

He'd be suspicious.

Where does he think the milk is coming from?

Some people can't imagine being stolen from.

Too strong.

Let's hope he's one of those.

How much will we charge?

Twenty? Twenty-five?

♪♪

That sounds like quite a situation indeed.

And in the end, how... How many lashes did you order?

Twenty.

Hmm... a fine number, but for mutiny...

It was a memorable day for that man.

It seems conservative.

More than 20 and he would have been useless for the remainder of the voyage.

- And he was a young hand?

- Mm, not so young.

Ah. There is the rub, you see.

When one factors the loss of labor from the punished hand versus the gain of labor from those hands who witness the punishment, a stricter punishment can be the more advisable path.

Even a properly rendered death can be useful in the ultimate accounting.

It is a highly motivating spectacle for the indolent, let alone the mutinous.

Yes, fair enough, but... some calculations can never truly be made.

Now, there you are wrong, Captain.

Any question that cannot be calculated is not worth the asking.

Ah. Here is our baker.

Uh, bring the clafoutis in... in here, Cookie.

Show the captain.

Indeed. It is a fine looking cake, Mister...

Figowitz.

And what brought you to the

Oregon Territory, Mr. Figowitz?

Oh, chance.

I hired on with a trapping company.

- Ah, Ashley's men.

- No, a lesser crew.

They're trapping out the whole map.

There won't be any pelts here much longer.

I disagree. The beaver here are endless.

Smart animals, the beaver.

When I got here, the beaver were everywhere, whole cities of beaver living like people in row houses in New York.

Well, in any case, the fashions are changing in Paris.

The beaver hat is on the wane.

The... the Chinese market remains strong.

Beaver will always find a home.

It is too beautiful, too supple.

Hmm. Mm.

Ah.

Wh-what he's saying is that the men in Paris favor new hats this season.

They no longer want beaver fur.

But... but I'm saying to him that the beaver here will last forever.

He's saying he doesn't understand why the white men hunt so much beaver and never eat the tail.

- The tail is delicious.

- Huh.

Well, maybe [ will.

I'm sick to death of salmon already.

You can tell him that.

Ah, here we are.

Chinese black tea, very subtle.

Uh, cream?

Enjoy the cream, Captain.

My cow gives so little.

She's a lonely girl, I fear.

You have a cow?

Yes. She's only been here for a month or so, sans husband, I'm afraid.

I'm hoping to find her a mate within the year.

Would you like to see her?

Let... let's take a walk.

Shall we?

Tell me, Captain, what are the fashions in Paris this year?

Hmm...

The ladies are moving away from the Empire silhouette this year.

They're favoring fuller skirts and, uh, visible corseting.

For the men, broad shoulders and puffed sleeves, trousers for smart day wear, britches and cordon in the country.

As for colors, canary yellow and turkey red are the colors du jour.

History moves so quickly in Paris.

So quickly, it wears itself out.

It never reaches here at all.

She seems well enough.

Yes.

And yet she barely produces a thing.

- What's her provenance?

- Oh, she's of a good line, half Alderney of Isigny and half from Froment du Leon from the province of Brittany.

She's a very fine cow.

Froment du Leon from the province of Brittany.

The cow has got better breeding than I do.

A royal cow.

Maybe we should halt for a while.

I think the Captain sensed something.

Hm. Now is our time.

Another cow is on the way.

And more cows after that.

- And Chief Factor is...

- Is a fool.

He misses everything right under his nose.

Paris this, London that.

What kind of woman is he?

Men like us, Cookie, we have to make our own way.

There are no Empire silhouettes or colors du jour for us.

We have to take what we can when the taking is good.

I know.

We'll sell a little longer, and then we'll make our way south.

We haven't even begun, Cookie.

Psst, psst, psst, psst, psst!

Come on back.

Come on back, you stupid cat!

Inside, before you get me in trouble.

Aah!

Are you all right?

Mm.

- Can you move?

- Yeah. Yeah.

We got to go.

Something... Someone in the meadow!

- What?

- Attackers all around!

- What?

- I woke the house! Get dressed.

Hurry!

God's sake, Thomas!

You there!

It would appear that someone's been milking your cow.

Figowitz... the Chinaman.

Figowitz!

No, no. Not home.

Which way?

The deer's path is up back up over there,

- but the river path is...

- Stealing my milk.

I'll kill him!

Shh! Do you hear that?

What's that? What's that?

There's one crossing the river, sir!

We'll overtake him on foot!

Use the path downriver!

Lloyd, you hurry on, and we'll... we'll follow!

Yes, sir!

Lehayim.

Lehayim.

I-Is this your canoe??

I need to go downriver.

Dindindin.

- Dingalingaling?

- Mm.

I need to find my friend.

He doesn't know where I am.

Not even northwest.

- Over here? Huh?

- He's probably got a mustache.

Aye, Johnny Hart. Hal!

The home is totally abandoned, that one.

Heart. Heart like a red beating heart?

No, like, uh...

Hart like a deer.

Aye. Jon Hart.

A cheater by any spelling.

I've skunked him every game, regardless.

He's not a worthy opponent.

He prefers to discard just one card to the crib.

- One card?

- Aye.

Abysmal.

It's an archaic rule, but he prefers the old ways.

Aye.

The guy a poor adversary is on John Suckling's noble game.

Cribbage players are in short supply in this hemisphere.

Aye. I've suffered for it daily.

Get away from here.

We'll tell our stories later.

That's quite a scratch on your head.

We'll clean it when we rest.

There's a port at the mouth of the river.

We will go downstream and catch the first clipper south.

Priorities or whatever.

You gotta take that out of the equation. Now what?

(Woman 1) Well, that's what

I was saying. It's not just...

(Man 1) No, no, you can find a reason.

And I wanna find out what happens, too.

So, no money.

What have you got left?

You've got other people.

You got Clara, you've got time.

Time's a big one.

But you've got about as much as anyone else, give or take.

What about God? Maybe you've got God.

Do you?

- (Woman 1) What? Have God?

- Yes.

No.

OK.

Well, here's how I break it down.

A writer writes a novel.

A songwriter writes a song.

A symphonist writes a symphony, which is maybe the best example because all the best ones were written for God.

So, tell me what happens if Beethoven's writing his "Ninth Symphony" and suddenly he wakes up one day and realizes that God doesn't exist.

So, suddenly all of these notes and chords and harmonies that were intended to, you know, supersede the flesh, you realize,

"Oh, that's just physics."

So Beethoven says,

"Shoot, God doesn't exist,

"so I guess I'm writing this for other people.

"It's just nuts and bolts now."

He didn't have any children, that I can recall,

- but if he did...

- He had a nephew.

- He had a what?

- A nephew, he had a nephew.

OK. Great. So he-he writes it for him.

Or Immortal Beloved.

Yes.

Or for whoever that was.

But let's leave love out of this and let's wrap this all up under the blanket of someone thinking,

"This is something that they'll remember me for."

And they did. And we do.

And sure enough, we do what we can to endure.

We build our legacy piece by piece, and maybe the whole world will remember you, or maybe just a couple of people, but you do what you can to make sure you're still around after you're gone.

And so we're still reading this book, we're still singing the song, and kids remember their parents and their grandparents and everyone's got their family tree, and Beethoven's got his symphony, and we've got it too.

And everyone will keep listening to it... for the foreseeable future.

But... that's where things start breaking down because your kids...

Do you have kids?

Wait, who here has kids?

You? Your kids are gonna die.

Yours too. Yours too.

Hey, just sayin'.

They're all gonna die, and their kids will die, and so on, and so on.

And then there's gonna be one big, one big tectonic shift.

Yosemite will blow and the western plates will shift, and the oceans will rise, the mountains will fall, and 90 percent of humanity will be gone.

One fell swoop. This is just science.

Whoever's left will... go to higher ground and social order will fall away, and we will revert to scavengers and hunters and gatherers, but maybe there's someone... someone who one day hums a melody they used to know.

(Humming Beethoven's Ninth Symphony)

And it gives everyone a little bit of hope.

Mankind's on the verge of being wiped out but it keeps going a little bit longer because someone hears someone else hum a melody in a cave and the physics of it in their ear make them feel something other than fear or hunger or hate, and mankind carries on and civilization gets back on track.

And now you're thinking you're gonna finish that book.

But it won't last.

'Cause by and by, the planet's gonna die.

In a few billion years the sun will become a red giant and it'll eventually swallow Earth whole.

This is a fact.

Now, maybe by that point, we'll have set up shop on some completely different planet.

Good for us. Maybe we've figured out a way of carrying with us all these things that matter.

They've got a photocopy of the Mona Lisa out there, someone sees it, mixes a little bit of alien dirt with some spit, paints something new, the whole thing keeps going.

(Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing)

But even that doesn't matter.

Because even if some form of mankind carries some recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony all the way into the future, the future's gonna hit a brick wall.

The universe will keep expanding, and it'll eventually take all matter with it.

Everything you've ever strived for, everything that you and some stranger on the other side of the planet share with some future stranger on some entirely different planet without even knowing it, everything that ever made you feel big or stand up tall, it'll all go.

Every atom in this dimension... will be pulled apart by force as simple as...

(Can clatters)

And then all these shredded particles will contract again... and... the universe is gonna suck itself back into a speck too small for any of us to see.

So, you can write a book... but the pages will burn.

You can sing a song and pass it down.

You can write a play and hope that folks will remember it... keep performing it.

You can build your dream house... but ultimately none of that matters any more than digging your fingers into the ground to bury a fence post.

Or... or fucking.

Which I guess is just about the same thing.

(Linda) Here we are.

Take a look around.

We've got two, uh, bedrooms back there with a bathroom.

The kitchen's that way.

There's a study/den.

- We haven't had tenants in a few month

- (Notes on piano)

- so it's a little musty.

- (Man) Does it come with the piano?

Oh, it's... always...

(Playing jazz music)

It's always been here.

- It's... If you want...

- Does it come?

It's always been here.

(Plays blues melody and chord)

就该去市立学院  然后进监狱 just go to city college, and then to jail,

再回市立学院上课 and then back to city college,

然后你可能就懂得要怎么振作起来 and then maybe you'd learn to pull yourself up

而不是老指望别人会怎么样 and not expect everybody to --

也有可能是自杀 which maybe was a suicide.

但我妈说如果你对自己的人生那么不上心

But my mom says same difference,

那跟自杀没什么两样 if you're that careless with your life.

我妈来了  我走了

That's her. Gotta go.

-再见  伙计们  -再见

- Bye,guys. - Bye

我差点忘了

用它就能弄吉姆·莫里森的发型了

For your Jim Morrison hair.

-太谢谢你了  -不用谢

谢谢你  我就想听这句

Thank you. That's what I like to hear.

修改正确 and work them out.

考得不错  小朱

Good job, Jules.

从你的卷子上我能看出来

I can tell from your work

你做错的题其实你会做 you even understood the ones you missed.

妈的

Suck a dick.

我喜欢"小朱"

I like "Jules."

我就是不明白为什么我数学不好

I just don't get why I'm not good at math.

我爸爸数学可好了

My dad is really good in math.

连米格尔都有个数学学位

Even Miguel has a math degree.

或许怪你妈吧

Maybe it's your mom's fault.

再见

Bye.

马特

Matt.

你出过国吗

Have you ever been out of the country?

小时候出过

When I was little.

我爸爸以前有一份在巴西的工作

My-- my dad had a job that took him to Brazil.

我看照片想起来的

I remember from the pictures.

我梦想去

My dream to--

-对不起  -不  没关系  你说

- Sorry. - No. No, you go.

我从没出过国

I've never been out of the country.

我梦想去巴黎

It's, it's my dream to go to Paris.

巴黎

Paris.

所以我在学法语

That's why I'm taking French.

我妈说法语没用

My mom said French wasn't useful.

如果你想去巴黎就有用

It is if you wanna go to Paris.

我还是不知道怎么用你给我的卷发棒

I still don't know how to use those rollers that you gave me.

很简单

It's so easy.

等卷发棒热起来之后

So, after they heat up--

取一绺头发

...you-- you take your hair

把头发这样卷起来  然后 and you twist the hair like this, and...

拉里  我们还能撑多久

Larry, how long will this hold us?

-我不知道  -总有人得知道

- I don't know. - Well, somebody's gotta know.

我不确定

I'm not sure.

要是有人出点事怎么办

What happens if somebody gets in an accident?

遣散费马上就到期了

The severance package expires all at once.

自然年内不可能了

Not within the calendar year.

-她回来了吗  -要不今晚就算了吧

- Is she home? - Maybe just leave it tonight.

不  她懂事了  她不能再这样偷溜进来了

No, she knows better. She can't sneak around like this.

玛丽恩

Marion.

克里斯汀  你不能把房间弄得这么乱

Christine. You can't leave your room like this.

我没有

I didn't.

没有一件东西是放好的

None of these things were put away right.

乱糟糟的

They aren't nice.

-克里斯汀  快收拾 -我把衣服收好了

- Christine, now. - I put my clothes away.

-我叫淑女鸟  -不要对我撒谎

- My name is Lady Bird. - Don't lie to me.

这件校服  到周一就会跟一团抹布一样

This uniform-- this is gonna look like trash on Monday.

这样放不对  不能把衣服团成一团

This isn't right. We can't treat our clothes like this.

我不知道你的那些有钱的朋友是怎么做的

I don't know what your wealthy friends do--

我怎么放衣服跟你有什么关系

Why do you care what I do to my clothes?

你爸爸没工作

Your father doesn't have a job.

他失业了

He lost his job.

需要他进来向你解释这些吗

Do you need him to come in here and explain that to you?

当然他或许不会这样做  他是老好人

Of course, he probably wouldn't anyway. He's Mr. Nice guy,

我一直不得不当个坏人 and I always have to be the bad guy.

我们能不能

Can we please just talk...

-你不能邋邋遢遢的  -明天再谈

- It can't look like a rag, -...about this tomorrow?

因为那会让我们一家人看起来像乞丐一样

Because that makes us look like rags.

想听真话吗  这就是真话

You wanna know the truth? Here's the truth.

你那些朋友们的爸爸或许可以雇用你爸

Some of your friends' fathers could employ your father,

但如果这家人看起来不体面  他们就不会雇你爸 and they're not gonna do it if it looks like his family is trash.

你懂吗

You understand?

要是没把衣服收好

Didn't you ever go to sleep

你就不睡觉吗 without putting all your clothes away perfectly?

一次都没有吗

Like even once?

你不希望你妈妈没生气吗

And don't you wish your mom hadn't gotten angry?

我妈是个酗酒的虐待狂

My mother was an abusive alcoholic.

所以  你对任何天主教大学都没兴趣

So, I understand you're not interested in any catholic colleges.

没兴趣

No way.

对不起  但是确实没兴趣

Sorry. But yes, no way.

所以你要申请加州大学各分校和州立大学

Then you'll be applying to UCs and state schools.

是的  还有东海岸一些像耶鲁一样的文理学院

Yeah, but also those east coast liberal arts schools like Yale,

不是特指耶鲁  因为我可能考不上 but not Yale, because I probably couldn't get in.

你肯定考不上

You definitely couldn't get in.

我的责任之一是帮你认清现实

Part of my job is to help you be realistic.

是啊  好像所有人都有这份责任

Yeah. It seems like everyone's job.

你的SAT成绩出奇的好

Your SAT scores are strangely very good.

我给一些你感兴趣的

I had placed some calls to

本地大学的校友打了几通电话 local alumni of the schools you're interested in,

不幸的是  已经没有面试机会了 but unfortunately, all the interviews are taken.

所以那意味着什么呢

So what does that mean?

意味着你得靠卷面成绩进大学了

It means you'll have to get in on how you look on paper.

*梦想不灭  请一直心怀梦想*

*Dreams don't die, so keep an eye on your dream*

*在你发现之前  你已登上山巅*

*And before you know where you are, there you are*

好了  停停停

All right. Stop, stop, stop.

我们是不是该回家了

Should we go home?

我妈总是气呼呼的

My mom is always mad.

回家晚也没关系  反正她都是要生气的

Doesn't matter if I get home late. She'll be mad at me anyway.

-你妈对你真严厉  -是的  她很爱我

- Your mom's hard on you. - Yeah, well, she loves me a lot.

选颗我们俩的星星吧

Pick a star for us.

那颗  就在那

That one. Right there.

最亮的旁边  有颗暗一点的  看到了吗

Next to the bright one, and then the dim one. You see it?

那就是我们的星星

That's our star.

其实

You know...

你可以摸我的胸  你知道吧

You can touch my boobs, right?

我知道  我很尊重你才没摸

I know. It's just that I respect you too much for that.

好  太好了

Cool. Awesome.

我非常理解  谢谢你

I totally get that. Thank you.

不用谢

You're welcome.

如果你有胸的话  我也不会摸的

If you had boobs, I wouldn't touch them either.

我很尊重你

I respect you so much...

因为我爱你

Because I love you.

我也爱你

I love you too.

我们的星星就叫克劳德吧

Let's name our star Claude.

你不觉得太做作了吗

That's pretentious, don't you think?

是法语名  我们给它起什么名字好

It's French. What should we name it?

布鲁斯

Bruce.

-我爱你  -我爱你

- I love you! - I love you.

布鲁斯

Bruce.

不碰男生的老二是正常的

It's normal to not touch a penis.

我得去上课了

I have to go to class.

-但是我没课  -我得考过历史

- But I have free period. - I need to pass history.

我觉得高中学习这方面已经完事了

I think we're done with the learning portion of high school.

-我得走了  -不许走

- I'm gonna go. - No.

我不喜欢一个人待着

I hate being alone.

拜拜  爱你

Bye! Love you!

旧货商店

丹尼说没说  他奶奶办的是不是正式的感恩节晚宴

Did Danny say whether his grandmother has a formal Thanksgiving?

不知道  反正有许多孩子

I don't know. There are a lot of kids,

但是她过着那种40年代的精致生活 but she lives in the fab 40s.

我跟你爸有一次

Oh, well, your dad and I

去那片小区参加过一次晚宴 went to a dinner party once in that neighborhood.

ISC的总裁  还挺正式的

The CEO of ISC. That was pretty formal.

你又不是去参加葬礼

You're not going to a funeral.

我不知道  什么样算是"富人感恩节"服装

Well, I don't know. What says "Rich people Thanksgiving"?

我就是觉得

I just think it's such a shame

最后一个感恩节你不跟家人过 that you're spending your last Thanksgiving

反倒去跟一家素未谋面的人过  挺丢人的 with a family you've never met instead of us, but--

不过我知道  你就想那样

I know. I guess you want it that way.

-你累吗  -不累

- Are you tired? - No.

-玛丽恩  -乔伊斯  宝宝怎么样了

- Hey, Marion. - Hey, Joyce. Hey, how's the baby?

-会爬了  -等会儿去收银台我想看看照片

- She's crawling. - No! I wanna see a picture at checkout.

-好啊  -好

- Ok. - Ok.

-你要是累的话  我们坐一会儿  -我不累

- 'Cause if you're tired, we can sit down. - I'm not tired.

因为你刚才拖着脚走路  我看不出你是不是累了

Okay. I just couldn't tell because you were dragging your feet.

我就是看不出来

Well, I just couldn't tell.

你为什么不直接说"抬脚走路"

Why didn't you just say, "Pick up your feet"?

我不知道你是不是累了

I didn't know if you were tired.

-你刚才那叫消极攻击  -我没有

- You were being passive-aggressive. - No, I wasn't.

-你太让人生气了  -别嚷嚷

- You are so infuriating. - Please stop yelling.

-我没喊  太完美了  -宝贝  喜欢吗

- I'm not yelling. Oh! It's perfect! - Honey, do you love it?

因为我的成绩册...

So, because my grade book has...

不见了  那我们这么办好了 disappeared, here's what we're gonna do.

我需要你们来重新登记成绩

I'm gonna count on you to reconstruct it, okay?

我知道你们比谁都清楚自己的成绩

Now, I know you all know your grades better than anybody.

我大致知道情况

I have a general idea,

但现在就靠诚信了 but this is all about the honor code right now.

我是A减

A-minus.

我非常确定是A

Pretty sure it was an A.

不是  但...好吧

I'm not, but okay.

是的  相信我  我一眼就能看出来天才

It was. Trust me, I know talent when I see it.

不客气  不对  谢谢

You're welcome. No. Thank you.

我觉得是B

I think B.

我印象中更像是B减  甚至可能是C加

I thought it was more like b-minus, maybe even c-plus territory?

不  因为我上次测验考得特别好

No, because I did really well on the last quiz.

我记得你只是稍微好那么一点点

I seem to remember you doing only slightly better.

这样我的平均分就够B了

That brought my average up to a B.

行  那就B

Okay. B it is.

这是你的诚信

It's your honor.

淑女鸟  你小情人来了

参加我祖母的感恩节晚宴  麦克弗森太太 come to my grandmother's Thanksgiving, Mrs. McPherson.

别  不用客气  叫我玛丽恩就行

我是米格尔  她哥

Hey, I'm Miguel, the brother.

我觉得淑女鸟想来个闪亮登场

I think Lady Bird wants to make an entrance.

她好气我们没有螺旋式楼梯

She's mad we don't have a spiral staircase.

-谢丽  -什么

- Shelly. - What?

我的名字

Is my name.

有趣的是  我来的路上  经过了火车道

It's funny. On my way over here, I went over the train tracks.

-你走H街过来的  -是的

- Oh, you took h street. - Right. And so,

淑女鸟总说

Lady Bird always says that

自己住在贫民区[铁轨不好的那一边] she lives on the wrong side of the tracks,

我一直以为这是个比喻 but I always thought that was like a metaphor.

没想到竟然真的有铁轨

But there are actual train tracks.

太美了

You look amazing!

你拿行李袋干什么

What the hell is in the duffel bag?

不用担心  天啊

Don't worry about it. Jeez.

'look up at the sky and count the stars if you can.'

又对他说  '你的后裔将要如此' just so, he added, 'shall your descendants be.'

Abram put his faith in the lord.

耶和华就以此为他的义"

为什么我就不能像杂志上那些女生一样

Why don't I look like the girls in the magazines?

舞会前我见不到这位凯尔真是太遗憾了

It's too bad I can't meet this Kyle before prom.

他不再是我的男朋友了

Well, he's not my boyfriend anymore.

他可能之前也不算

I mean, maybe he never even was.

我还是想见见他

Well, I'd still like to meet him.

该死  衣服太紧了

It's too tight. Fuck.

我和你说了别吃第二份通心粉了

Well, I suggested you not have that second helping of pasta.

-妈妈  -亲爱的  你好像有些沮丧

- Mom. - Honey, you seem upset about it

-我只是想帮忙  -你要让我患上厌食症了

- and I'm trying to help. - You're giving me an eating disorder.

我真希望我有厌食症

I wish I could get an eating disorder.

我很喜欢

I love it.

会不会太粉嫩了

Is it too pink?

怎么了

What?

你为什么不能说我看起来很漂亮

Why can't you say I look nice?

我以为你根本不会在意我的想法

I thought you didn't even care what I think.

-我还是希望你觉得我很美  -好的  对不起

- I still want you to think I look good. - Okay. I'm sorry.

我只是实话实说  你想让我撒谎吗

I was telling you the truth. You want me to lie?

不  我是只想

No. I mean, I just wish...

我只是

I just...

我希望你喜欢我

I wish that you liked me.

我当然爱你

Of course I love you.

但你喜欢我吗

But do you like me?

我希望你能成为

I want you to be

你能成为的最好的那一个自己 the very best version of yourself that you can be.

如果现在就是最好的呢

What if this is the best version?

你看起来很漂亮

You look really pretty.

-真的吗  -是的

- Really? - Yeah.

你看起来像乐队里的酷女孩

You look like a badass girl in a band.

谢谢

Thanks.

我舞伴来了

I guess that's my date.

你不会跟一个按喇叭的人上车吧

You aren't gonna get in a car with a guy who honks, are ya?

我想我会的

I think, yes, I am.

我来给你照张相

Let me get your picture.

你妈特生气  她今天得轮两次班

Your mom's pissed, she had to work a double.

就算是你也该值得更好的

Even you deserve better than this.

玩得开心

Have a good time.

祝你好运

Yeah. Good luck.

-再见  -再见

- See ya. - See ya.

-我觉得她很怪  -她是很怪

- I think she's weird. - She is weird.

伙计们

Hey, guys.

I guess I'll just sit shotgun.

好的

Yeah.

-你今天很帅  凯尔  -你也好美

- You look really nice, Kyle. - You look good.

谢谢

Thanks.

你好吗  伙计

Hey, what's going on, man?

嗯  听起来不错

Yeah. Okay, that sounds great.

好的

Okay.

你们想翘了舞会  直接去迈克家吗

Hey, do you guys wanna ditch prom and just go to Mike's instead?

好啊  我讨厌跳舞

Yeah. I hate dances.

好的

Yes.

好的  不去舞会

Yeah. Okay. No prom.

我真是烦这首歌

I fucking hate this song.

我很喜欢

I love it.

实际上我想去参加舞会

I actually want to go to prom.

好吧

Okay. Yeah. I mean...

我不太想去

I don't really want to do that.

你能把我送到我朋友朱莉家吗

Can you-- can you take me to my friend, Julie's house, please?

当然

Sure.

谁是朱莉

Who's Julie?

她是我闺蜜

She's my best friend.

朱莉  亲爱的

Julie, honey?

有人来看你了

There's someone here to see you.

-你还好吗  -嗯  还行

- Are you okay? - Fine. I'm fine.

出什么事了

What happened?

没什么  真的

Nothing really. Nothing.

你为什么哭呢

Why are you crying?

就是哭而已

Just crying.

有些人天生就是不快乐

Some people aren't built happy, you know.

天啊

Oh, my gosh.

我们把芝士吃完了

We ate all the cheese.

没事的  芝士这么多  有大有小

It's okay. Lots of cheese vary in size.

-这就是一小块  -真的好小

- This one was a small one. - It's so small.

-小小的  -这不是我们的错

- It was tiny. - That's not our fault.

不然我们能怎么办

What-what were we to do?

管它呢  我们去舞会吧

Fuck it! Let's just go to prom.

你妈妈应该有裙子吧

Doesn't your mom have a dress?

实话实说  我裙子几个月前就准备好了

Let's be honest. I've had a dress for months.

紫色的

It's purple.

-是吗  -你会喜欢的

- It is? - Uh-hmm, you're really gonna like it.

-来看看  -好的

- Come and see it. - Okay.

穿裙子喽  扮漂亮喽

Cracker time. Dress time.

希望它合身

I hope it fits.

小电影里  人们叫得可欢实了

People make so much noise in the movies,

但其实叫床不重要 but it's really not a big thing.

你完全可以全程安静的

You can totally be quiet during it.

很神奇吗

Was it amazing though?

我曾经是那么想要

I wanted it so badly,

但等真正经历过之后 but then I found that when it happened...

我其实更喜欢干磨蹭

I-I really like dry humping much more.

你不是处女

You're not a virgin.

-我等不及去加州大集市了  -我知道

- I can't wait for state fair. - Ah, I know.

-水中过山车  -水中过山车

- Log ride. - Log ride.

-该死  -怎么了

- Shit. - What?

这个夏天  整个夏天  我都不在这

I'm not gonna be here this summer, like, all summer, basically.

-为什么不在  -我爸  我亲爸

- Why not? - My dad, my real dad,

他在黄石公园重新出现了 he resurfaced in yellowstone,

他想让我在去萨克拉门托市大学前 and he wants me to come there for the summer,

去他那里过暑假 before I start SCC.

我不会去别的地方读大学

I'm not going anywhere to college,

感觉这是个去玩的好机会 so it seemed like a good opportunity.

是啊

Yeah.

我会很想你的

I'm gonna miss the fuck out of you.

我可能没被录取

I probably won't get in, so

那我就去戴维斯分校  天天都能见你

I'll go to Davis and I'll see you every day.

我再没有魔法迷人  再没有精灵为我奔走

Now, I want spirits to enforce, and art to enchant,

我的结局将要变成不幸的绝望 and my ending is despair.

除非依靠着万能的祈祷的力量

Unless I be relieved by prayer,

它能把慈悲的神明的心中刺彻 which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself

赦免了可怜的下民的一切过失 and freeze all faults.

你们有罪过希望别人不在追究

As you from crimes would pardon thee.

愿你们也格外宽大  给我以自由

Let your indulgence set me free.

亲爱的克里斯汀  我知道你现在叫淑女鸟了  很好听

但我想起我的奇迹你刚出生时我给你取的名字

亲爱的淑女鸟  我每次看你都觉得你棒极了

她担心自己

She was worried that

I wouldn't do that.

# Marriage Story

What I love about Nicole...

She makes people feel comfortable about even embarrassing things.

Hey, you look like you care about animals.

Yes, I do.

She really listens when someone is talking.

-Do you want to sign up here?

-You know what? I...

It's funny, I actually signed up for this, but I never heard from you guys.

Sometimes she listens too much for too long.

Okay, if you e-mail me here —

-Thank you so much. Have a good day.

-Good luck.

She is a good citizen.

- Just call him.

- I'm not calling.

She always knows the right thing to do when it comes to difficult family shit.

Call him.

I get stuck in my ways, and she knows when to push me and when to leave me alone.

She cuts all our hair.

Yeah!

She is always inexplicably brewing a cup of tea that she doesn't drink.

And it's not easy for her to put away a sock, or close a cabinet, or do a dish, but she tries for me.

Nicole grew up in LA around actors, and directors, and movies, and TV, and is very close to her mother, Sandra, and Cassie, her sister.

Note the wrapping.

Nicole gives great presents.

She is a mother who plays, really plays.

-Lizard?

-Yeah.

She never steps off playing or says iris too much.

-Mom.

-And it must be too much some of the time.

"...chopped down a Christmas tree..."

All right.

Nice. Two, three, four... What?

Are you kidding me? I was just in jail!

Goddamn it!

- Do not laugh at me! Stop it!

- She is competitive.

She is amazing at opening jars because of her strong arms, which I've always found very sexy.

She keeps the fridge over-full.

No one is ever hungry in our house.

She can drive a stick.

How could you?

After that movie, All Over The Girl, she could have stayed in LA and been a movie star; but she gave that up to do theater with me in New York.

You might as well get what you paid for.

She is brave.

She is a great dancer.

Infectious.

She makes me wish I could dance.

She always says when she doesn't know something, or hasn't read a book, or seen a film or a play, whereas I fake it or say something like I haven't seen it in a while.

My crazy ideas are her favorite things to figure out how to execute.

Let's try it... crawling... but also standing.

She is my fa favorite actress.

What I love about Charlie...

Charlie is undaunted

He never lets other people’s opinions or any setbacks keep him from what he wants to do.

And he liked me, so...

Charlie eats like he’s trying to get it over with and like there won '1' be enough food for e everyone.

A sandwich is to be strangled while devoured. ls your sweater on backwards?

But he is incredibly neat, and I rely on him to keep things in order.

So...

He's energy-conscious.

Hey.

Sorry.

He doesn't look in the mirror too often.

I cried four times.

Me too.

He cries easily in movies.

I wonder if it was the same four.

He is very self-sufficient.

He can darn a sock, and cook himself dinner, and iron a shirt.

How are we doing over here?

The peppers are cut.

He rarely gets defeated, which...

I feel like I always do.

...cut some carrots.

Charlie takes all of my moods steadily.

He doesn't give in to them or make me feel bad about them.

He's a great dresser.

He never looks embarrassing, which is hard for a man.

Goddamn it, Charlie, get it together!

He's very competitive.

Come on!

- What's this? Who owns Baltic Avenue?

- Me.

How much is it?

-I don't have enough.

—$450.

Okay, so I'm done?

I'm done, right? That's it?

This is so frustrating!

This is so frustrating. I always lose.

- Dad.

- He loves being a dad.

He loves all the things you're supposed to hate, like the tantrums, the waking up at night.

I had a bad dream.

It's okay.

It's almost annoying how much he likes it, but... then, it's mostly nice.

Dad, stay.

He disappears into his own world.

Shit.

- What's "shit?"

- This is our stop.

He and Henry are alike in that way.

He can tell people when they have food in their teeth or on their face in a way that doesn't make them feel bad.

Did you get it? Perfect.

Charlie is self-made.

His parents...

I only met them once, but... he told me there was a lot of alcohol and some violence in his childhood.

As soon as she comes with a lookout, they're coming with a camcorder.

-Camcorder.

-Is that what they're called?

He moved to New York from Indiana with no safety net, and now he's more New Yorker than any New Yorker.

I made sure they used the right almond milk.

Genius.

He is brilliant at creating family out of whoever is around.

With the theater company, he cast a spell that made everyone feel included.

No one, not even an intern, was unimportant.

He could remember all the inside jokes.

And where do you go when it's windy?

Yeah, that — that was funny.

He is extremely organized and thorough.

He's very clear about what he wants, unlike me, who can't always tell.

Let's stop right there.

Who wants to start?

I-I'm not going to read this out loud.

Why is that?

Because I don't like what I wrote.

As we mediate your separation and eventual divorce, things can get quite contentious.

So, I like to begin with a note of positivity, for the people I work with to remember why they got married in the first place.

And so that, as you come apart, you're reminded that... this is a person you had great feeling for, and maybe still do in many ways.

I'll read mine. I like what I wrote.

For it to really work, you both have to read.

I'm not going to.

Okay, um...

I just think it's a shame that you guys aren't going to get to hear, the wonderful things you wrote about each other.

She always says I can't write, but I think mine's pretty good.

Nicole, maybe you'd change your mind once you heard Charlie's.

I don't want to hear Charlie's.

We promised to listen.

That's right.

That's the very first step in this process.

Well, I think I'm going to go if you two are going to just sit around and suck each other's dicks.

How can this evil allow moderation ?

How can this evil allow moderation?

How can it be right to betray the departed?

How is it human to be so... faithless?

I want no praise from impious men.

No home with them of quiet ease.

Noble blood still runs in my veins.

Shall I fail my father... stifling my cries, clipping the wings of grief?

Must his corpse in the ground wretchedly waste away, feebly count for nothing?

Must his killers gloat...

Must his killers gloat, never to pay with blood, for blood...

Charlie gave me the note, but it's really for you.

-He told me to pick up my cues.

-How is that for me?

Acting is reacting.

I'm responding to you.

You're slowing me down.

Frank, it's closing night, you know.

You don't think Charlie and Nicole will ever get back together?

No, I think this time it's really over.

-It still feels weird.

-I feel like my parents are splitting up.

It's always been "Charlie and Nicole."

-Is Charlie still giving notes?

-Yep.

You're lucky, Nic.

I wish I was going to LA.

You can actually have space in LA.

There's no space here.

Ladies and gentlemen,

I want to make a toast to Charlie... and to our beloved Nicole, who is going to be going out on a new adventure, all the way to sunny California.

And we are also going to try something new.

We are going to take our play to Broadway.

It reminds me of when I was a young person and went to Broadway for the first time.

And I'm telling you, winning your first Tony at 27, it can mess with your head.

I mean, I was just a baby.

Elia Kazan was backstage...

I'm going to go over there now.

- Don't do it. Mary Ann?

- ...elbowing Mike Nichols.

And Mike was chatting with Dietrich, and Marlene, you know, she usually was a barrel of monkeys, but tonight she was very, very serious.

Could you give me a second?

Well, I'd have to study it, but...

Hey.

Hey, I didn't expect you guys home until late.

-How's he doing?

-Good, good. He went to bed on time.

No fuss.

Read him some of Cricket in Times Square.

God, you guys are so attractive.

Shit. Sorry, I didn't stop that from being said.

No, it's okay.

I'll pay for the whole time.

We decided to come home early.

Hey, thanks.

And also the travel time.

...conversation as well as anybody, but I've gotta run.

. . .if you know what I mean.

- Y- You're leaving?

- Well, I ain't moving in.

We 'We'll be back when you get your-

If you don't like that mediator, we'll find another one.

- Yeah.

- W-We might not need a mediator.

We'll just split everything anyway,

I don't care.

- Me neither.

- You can have most of it.

We'll get apartments near each other, make it easier for Henry.

We'll figure it out.

-We want the same things.

-Right.

In the meantime, the pilot will be fun for you.

You don't think it's bad, do you?

I don't ever watch TV, so, you know, I can't tell.

I told Henry I'd come out to LA in two weeks to see him.

Yes?

Nothing.

I can tell you want to give me a note.

No, I don't.

Yeah... I mean, yes, I do, but I guess...

I guess it doesn't matter now.

You won't be with the show anymore.

It's stupid.

You're not going to be able to sleep until you tell me.

Maybe not.

Okay, then.

So, there are two things.

I thought your posture at the top of scene seven is still too dignified.

-Okay.

-And then... at the end, I could tell you were pushing for the emotion.

Well, you know I can't cry on stage, and I know you don't like it when I fake it, but...

I thought maybe tonight it would come, but... it didn't.

That's all I had.

Thanks for indulging me.

Good night, Charlie.

-What do you want to do today?

Hang out and relax with you.

- Me too.

- No relaxing.

Nicole has a hair and makeup test today, and Henry, we got you into Fairy Camp with the cousins.

I hate Fairy Camp.

Cassie says everyone likes Fairy Camp, and I think this is true.

Henry, go make your mom some coffee like I taught you.

Mom, wait till you taste my coffee.

Oop-a-doodle.

Do you always sleep together?

Even in New York?

No, it's just for right now while we go through this transition.

Shit.

Don't tell Charlie when he gets here.

He hates co-sleeping.

Well, I have to say, I agree with Charlie.

Surprise surprise.

- It's as if you have exploded...

- Jesus, it's early.

...into this room.

I can do this part alone.

Fine. I won't look.

As long as you're in my house, wake up is at 6:30 a.m., and until you know what you want to do, we're going to do what I like to do.

I can't just go from what Charlie wanted to do to what you want to do.

Even though I am 64 and have a dead gay husband,

I manage to get up every day, live my life, and feel pretty good about myself.

So, maybe your mom knows a thing or two.

You know what I would do?

About what?

When Charlie gets here,

I'd whisk him off to Palm Springs.

That's what your father and I did whenever we hit a speed bump.

Didn't you walk in on Dad blowing the porter in Palm Springs?

And I always regretted getting so upset about it.

Charlie and I are getting a divorce, Mom.

There's nothing for us in Palm Springs.

You need to wash your face before you go to sleep.

When Daddy gets here,

- maybe we could all go on the Jaws ride.

- Yeah.

Or I could go once with Daddy and once with you, because I wouldn't mind going twice anyway.

No, we'll all go together, sweetheart.

Did you know that Universal Studios is where I did my first screen test?

On the plane, I re-read the pilot as if I were Charlie reading it, and I started to think it was just bad.

My agent says it's one to watch.

-This coffee is good. Thank you.

-You're welcome.

What if Charlie is on Broadway with a play I brought him, which I originated, and I'm just doing bad TV?

Everyone is only impressed when they see someone on TV.

- She's beautiful.

- Her wig looks great.

Where's she been the past ten years?

Doing weird theater in New York, downtown shit.

-I saw one. it rained onstage.

-Can I say something?

It was good. Edgy.

Directed by her husband, supposedly very controlling.

- We're lucky to have her.

- I'm surprised she said yes.

- We can thank her divorce.

- Can she move her hand?

It's going to be hard to roto in the hair on the baby around her fingers.

Can... you move your hand further down the baby?

- Where? Like here?

- Off the head entirely.

I have to support his head.

No, no, support the head, of course.

Just try and do it from the... shoulders?

- It's perfect.

- Yes, good.

I can't hold a baby like this.

She's right, that's going to look weird.

We can totally do it.

It'll just take time and money. it was very important to me to have this show based on hard science.

So we can see your pretty face and not ours.

You should've seen me before the plants invaded.

I say that with respect.

I was raised by two mothers.

Can you lower the board please, Pablo?

Here? How about here?

-How about now?

-Why is there always a flirty grip?

I can do anything you want.

I just need her here two hours —

Can I say something?

Dennis, hold on. What, honey?

She has to know how to hold a baby.

- Later on, after she kills Donny...

- She kills Donny?

That's a secret.

We didn't give the crew those pages.

...she becomes a sort of a Earth mother to the plant community.

That's not going to make any sense if we feel like she's a bad mother to her own kid.

-She's right.

-Does Donny know?

-Must be nice to get out of New York.

-Well, I'm from out here.

Our daughter, Mia, is at NYU, living in a shoebox.

She says it went up to 104 the other day.

-We are just so excited to have you.

-I'm excited to be here.

We're going for an early aughts aesthetic, so having your presence just nails that.

What signifies early aughts?

Into The Girl was on TV...

-All Over The Girl.

-...or streaming or something.

You are fucking hot in that movie.

-Carol.

-Fuck it, I speak my mind.

-We're not allowing our son to see it.

-Because you show your tits.

-Carol!

-Yeah.

-Dennis.

-This is Carter Mitchum.

He's a futurist at UCLA.

He's consulting on all the environmental stuff for the show so it's accurate.

-Nice to meet you.

-Is it?

-What?

-Accurate?

So far, none of it.

This pilot will go.

So get ready to move back to LA.

Listen, everything you were saying back there was absolutely right.

-If she's a bad mom, we lose the audience.

-Nobody knows we're killing Donny,

-including Donny.

-I... I thought —

Let us know if you'd like to be part of our writers' room.

I bet you'd be really helpful, actually.

Or I could direct.

-No, yeah.

-Sorry, what? Maybe that sounds crazy.

No, do you have a reel?

No, because I've — I've never done it.

I watched my husband do it for years.

Almost ex-husband.

What's the opposite of fiancé?

Dennis and I will talk to your agent about it.

At our theater I always wanted to direct, and then Charlie would say something like,

"The next one," but he was always the director, so there never was a next one.

I don't know. Maybe if we'd stayed married, there would've been.

Yeah, no. We're going to kill him off. it seems unlikely...

I'm going to give you a number.

Okay, is it a therapist?

Because I have a therapist.

Well, it's my mom's therapist.

We share her.

She's a lawyer. She represented me when I left Dennis.

You and Dennis are divorced?

Since 2013.

You still work together.

That's nice.

No, he's a fucking cocksucker.

Nora got me half of this project in the settlement.

Well, we talked about doing it without lawyers.

My sister had me meet a bunch of them already, and I... just... hated them.

Call Nora.

She saved my life.

Sorry, I... look so schleppy.

I had an event at my kid's school.

Let me get this out of the way.

I think you're a wonderful actress.

Thank you.

Moved All Over The Girl, but the theater stuff too...

You saw the theater stuff?

I was in New York last year for my book, which, remind me to give you a copy, and my publisher took me.

Great.

-Thank you.

-You are awesome.

- Well, Charlie directed it.

- I know.

He's very talented.

He is.

They're moving it to Broadway.

Well, without me, of course.

He was lucky to have you.

How are you doing?

Sorry.

Honey...

You take some breaths.

And while you do,

I'm going to tell you about myself.

If you should choose to hire me,

I will work tirelessly for you, and I'm always available by phone or text, except when I'm with my kids.

I insist on doing drop off and pick up every day at school.

- I understand.

- I've been through this myself.

Thank you, Annie. So...

I know how it feels.

-You do?

-Yes.

I have a kid from my ex, who is a narcissistic artist... and verbally abusive.

I'm now with a great boyfriend who lives in Malibu.

Good.

Well, Charlie's not terrible.

No, of course not.

But they ravish you with attention in the beginning...

And then once we have babies, we become the mom and... they get sick of us.

Yeah.

Where do you want to live now, doll?

Well...

I'm here now, obviously.

I don't know if the show will get picked up, but... it feels like home.

It is home.

It's the only home I've ever known without Charlie.

You want to stay here?

Charlie's not going to want that. He...

He hates LA.

We're interested in what you want to do.

Sounds to me like you did your time in New York.

He can do some time here, no?

He always said we would, but he never... did.

How old is your son?

Henry's eight.

Yeah.

He likes LA.

I don't know if it's fair to him.

I want you to listen to me.

What you're doing is an act of hope.

Do you understand that?

Yeah.

You're saying,

"I want something better for myself."

I do.

And this, right now, is the worst time.

It will only get better.

Wasn't it Tom Petty who said,

"The waiting is the hardest part"?

I don't know.

I represented his wife in their divorce.

I got her half of that song.

I don't want any money or anything.

I just worry because we weren't going to use lawyers, so...

I don't want to be too aggressive.

I want to stay friends.

We'll do it as gently as possible.

Now...

Can you tell me a little more about what's going on?

Because part of what we're going to do together is tell your story.

It's difficult to articulate.

It's... not as simple as not being in love anymore.

I understand.

Why don't you start at the beginning?

Wherever that is for you.

Well...

I was engaged to Ben and living in LA, you know?

And I felt like yes,

I want to make movies and marry Ben.

Jesus,

I was only 19 or 20 at the time.

I never felt older in my whole life.

Anyway, if I was honest with myself, it was like a small part of me felt dead... or dead-ish.

You know, you tell yourself,

"No one's perfect, no relationship's perfect."

This tea is delicious.

Isn't it? It's the Manuka honey.

Anyway, you were asking about Charlie.

So, um...

So, yes. So, I was... I was... happy with Ben and aware of the deadness, and I went to New York to meet with this director for this space movie.

But one where they take space seriously, like...

Sex trafficking in space.

You know, it was political.

Or at least they wanted us to think it was.

Anyway, it just... it was really fulfilling the same need that certain fucked up porn does.

Um, but anyway, so... while I was there... the producer...

Invited me to see a play.

It took place in someone's apartment with all the lights on.

It was like nothing I'd ever seen before.

This strange... surreal, dystopian story, and it was so well-acted.

And one of the actors was this big shaggy bear who played all his lines looking directly at me, which I knew couldn't be the case, but it felt like it.

And then later, of course,

I learned that it was.

-These cookies are really great too.

-I'll send you home with some.

Afterwards, I was introduced to the cast, and the bear turned out to also be the director.

He talked to me and...



I talked back.

The dead part wasn't dead, it was just in a coma.

And... it was better than the sex, the talking.

Although the... the sex was also like the talking.

You know, everything is like everything in a relationship.

Don't you find that?

And, um...

So, we spent... the whole night and the next day together and...

I just never left.

Yes, to be honest, all the problems were there in the beginning too.

But... I just went along with him and his life because it felt so damn good to feel myself alive.

In the beginning,

I was the actress, the star, and...

That felt like something, you know.

People came to see me at first, but... the farther away I got from that and... the more acclaim the theater company got,

I had less and less weight.

I just became...

"who?"

"Well, you know, the actress that was in that thing that time."

And he was the draw.

And... that... would've been fine, but...

I got smaller.

I realized I...

I didn't ever really come alive for myself.

I was just feeding his aliveness.

And... you know...

He was so smart and creative, it... it was fine.

You know, I would tell him things at home in private, and they would work their way into public conversation, into his work, and...

For a while, that felt like enough.

I mean, I was just so...

SO... so flattered that someone like him would... would find an idea I had worth trying or a comment I made worth repeating and... and then, I got pregnant.

And I thought that having a baby could be ours, could really be ours, but also really mine.

And... you know, he was so excited.

So, it was nice.

For a while.

I mean, kids, they... they belong to themselves. It's like... the instant they leave your body, it's just... the process of them going away...

And I didn't belong to myself.

And it was small stuff, stupid stuff, and big stuff.

All the furniture in our house was his taste.

I didn't even know what my taste was anymore because I had never been asked to use it.

I didn't even pick our apartment.

I just moved into his.

And I made noises about wanting to move back to LA, but... they came to nothing.

And we'd come here on holidays because he liked my family.

But if I suggested we do a year or something, he'd just put me off.

It would be... strange if he turned to me and said,

"And what do you want to do today?"

You know, I just watched that documentary on George Harrison, and I thought, "Own it.

Just own it.

Be like George Harrison's wife.

Being a wife and a mother, that's enough."

Yeah, then I realized

I couldn't remember her name, so...

This pilot came along.

It shot in LA and it paid so much...

And it was like there was this little lifeline thrown to me.

Here's this bit of earth that's yours, and...

I was embarrassed about it in front of him, but it was also like... yeah, this is who I am, and this is what I'm worth.

And maybe it's stupid, but at least it's mine.

And if he had just taken me into a big hug and said,

"Baby, I'm so excited for your adventure.

Of course I want you to have a piece of earth that's yours."

Then...

Well, then, we might not be getting divorced.

But... he made fun of it and... was jealous like he is, and... then he realized about the money.

And he told me I could funnel it back into the theater company.

And that's when I realized... he... truly didn't see me.

He didn't see me as something separate from himself.

And I asked him to say my phone number.

Laughs]

He didn't know it.

So, I left.

Also, I think he slept with the stage manager, Mary Ann.

That fucking asshole.

Seventy-five... just 70, those two zeros,

-seventy-five point zero zero...

-"if railroad is unowned...

-that's zero cents.

-...you may buy it from the bank."

"Advance to Illios...

-Illinois.

-...Illinois Avenue."

"Advance..." what does that mean?

It means you've got to go to Illinois Avenue.

So where is Illinois Avenue?

That one.

So Cassie, when Charlie gets here, you're going to hand him the envelope.

Why do I have to do it?

Because Nicole is very good at getting people to do things for her.

That's not what this is.

I wiped her butt until she was nine years old.

She's very seductive that way.

No, Mom, legally,

I can't be the one who serves him.

But still, what I'm saying is true.

Do I have to actually hand him the envelope?

Yes, but I'm going to tell him in advance that they're divorce papers.

Nora says it doesn't have to be so formal.

Where's Henry?

He's playing in the living room with Sam, and Jules, and Molly.

Let's get them upstairs.

Charlie's going to be here soon.

Sam, go upstairs.

So, I'll tell Charlie what's happening, and, Cassie, you then hand him the envelope.

Okay...

I just get nervous.

Well, can you un-serve?

- What do you mean? Like take it back?

- Yeah.

-I think so.

-You should check.

-In case we change our minds...

-I'm not going to change my mind.

-...or we feel too bad for him.

-Maybe in case I do something wrong.

Now you're both just making me feel bad, okay?

Sorry, sorry, I'm nervous!

Well, we all are.

And we love Charlie.

You have to stop loving him, Mom.

You can't be friends with him anymore.

Charlie and I have our own relationship...

...independent of your marriage.

Just like I'm still friends with Cassie's ex, Jeff.

Are you still seeing Jeff?

An occasional lunch.

I can't believe you!

He still wants his camera back, by the way.

Listen, nothing can be independent of our marriage right now.

I can't believe I even have to explain this to you. Just be on my side, okay?

- Okay.

- And... stop seeing Jeff!

Cassie, you're the server.

Just let me practice a few times.

I was never a good auditioner.

-That's because you wanted it too badly.

-It's not an audition.

- I'll play Charlie.

- It's just my palms are so perspired.

Sweetie, you're blotting the envelope.

Maybe Nicole should play you.

Did you really just say that?

We don't need to practice.

This is not a performance.

Did we finish the other wine already?

Yeah.

Okay, let me get him.

-Okay.

-You both go in the other room.

Cassie, you make sure that Henry goes upstairs with Molly and Jules.

Happening now.

-Mom!

-I'm getting my wine.

What?

Henry's pooping in the bathroom downstairs.

Can we transfer him to the one upstairs?

-I think it's mid-poop.

-Just grab him when he comes out.

-Cassie?

-What?

I'm... I'm putting the envelope over here by the toaster.

Copy you.

Hi.

- Where's Henry?

- He's pooping.

Hi, Henry!

Does this couch still open?

Yeah.

I got off the plane to a text, but don't tell anyone yet. It's still a secret.

Okay.

I won a MacArthur grant.

Charlie!

My God, that's great!

Congratulations.

I'll say it because you can't.

It's the genius grant. You're a genius.

I'm really happy for you.

You deserve it.

It's yours too.

We did all of this together.

Thank you, but... it's yours, Charlie, you enjoy it.

I'm starving.

It's good money, and they parse it out over five years.

But it means I can keep everyone in the theater company employed, pay my credit card debt.

So great.

Of course, I went instantly to,

"It's all downhill from here.

-Now my first Broadway play has to fail."

-No.

We just started rehearsals again, and I don't know.

You always don't know at this point, and then, it gets there.

Do I? Because I don't remember.

I know, it's true, it'll be great.

Okay, I hope you're right.

Everyone says hi.

Tell them hi. I miss everyone.

You'll see them again when you come back.

A MacArthur, Broadway...

It's so exciting.

Congratulations, Charlie.

Which bathroom?

-What?

-Is he pooping?

Downstairs.

Is your mom home?

Yeah, she's upstairs.

- Hey, how's it going?

- Nothing yet.

- It's me.

- I know.

- I just got here.

- Hi.

- I brought you something.

- Yay.

Mom's getting me a present too.

- Why?

- For pooping.

- I love you.

- I love you.

I don't think we should reward him for pooping anymore.

I know, but he holds it in and it's going on a week.

- It's its own reward. G-ma!

- Charlie-bird!

No! Stop it!

God, I'm huge!

- You're as light as a feather.

- Mom?

-Why didn't you respond to my last e-mail?

-Well, your e-mails are so articulate.

I get intimidated.

- Mom, can you —

-Now, I'm going to lift you!

Mom?

Mom?

-Mom?

-What?

Upstairs.

I'm going to write you back now.

Cassie?

Hey, Charlie.

- I like your haircut.

- Thanks.

- Mom?

- I'll go.

Henry's calling you, Nicole!

I hear him.

What's going on, Henry?

Can you ask Mom to come?

He wants you.

What kind of pie is that?

It's... pecan.

-Did you make it?

-I don't know.

No, it's store bought.

You know Joan's on Third?

- Yeah. It's good, right?

- What?

The store? Yeah.

Jules and Molly love it.

-Are you okay?

-Yes.

I'm just hot!

I'll pour you some water.

Nicole says you're doing a play?

I-I think you'd like it.

It's a great unproduced play by this really interesting British writer.

- So, you do an English accent?

- Yeah.

It's more northern England.

What does that sound like?

Ooh, you want a cup of tea, do ya?

Laughs]

Right. Good.

Thank you, missus. What is...

What's this?

It's a manila envelope, love.

- Ooh, can I start over?

- It has my name on it.

Ooh.

Jesus.

Sorry. You're served.

-What did you do?

-Nothing. I don't know.

I can't lie.

You're being served.

You guys are getting a div...

I don't know, I'm sorry.

I was going to warn you so it didn't become a thing. I'm sorry.

I feel like I'm in a dream.

We don't have a marriage anymore.

L-I know you don't want the disruption, but you don't want to be married.

Not... really.

But I don't want this.

What did you expect was going to happen?

I... I don't know,

I guess I didn't think it through, but I thought we agreed we weren't going to use lawyers.

I want...

I don't know, I'm trying to say this as undramatically as possible.

I want... an entirely different kind of life.

Let's wait until you finish this pilot and come back to New York.

Let's figure it out there, at home, together.

-Nora's known for being very fair.

-We don't need to do it with envelopes.

-This is Nora?

-Yeah.

She's great. I feel like we could be friends with her.

-Why do I feel like that won't happen?

-It's just a formality.

-Why...

-You don't have to respond right away.

Why did Cassie have a pie?

The pie was hers.

The pie wasn't part of it.

Are you sure?

I mean, what would the pie have to do with anything?

I don't know. it somehow makes it worse.

I'm sorry, but the pie was just a pie.

So, what...

What do I do?

You get a lawyer too.

"Well, I guess l better be going.

Stuart rose from the ditch, climbed into his car... and started up the road that led toward the north.

The sun was just coming up over the hills on his right.

As he peered ahead into the great land that stretched before him, the way seemed long... but the sky was bright.

And he somehow felt he was headed in the right direction."

I forgot it ended that way.

Yeah, wow, Stuart really overreacted, didn't you think?

He was upset about his boat.

Dad, you go away-

Mom, you stay.

-Hey, Daddy just got here.

-It's okay.

Love you.

You can come back, and wake me up, and read to me later, Daddy, okay?

Okay.

Will you come sleep in my bed later?

Yeah. on.

Hang in there, Charlie-bird.

Thanks, G-ma.

-He's in a mommy phase right now.

-It's okay.

Whoo!

I'm sorry. I drank too much wine.

-I can imagine.

-And didn't eat dinner.

Stressful time.

I hope Henry didn't notice.

I'm sure he didn't.

Now that I'm a parent,

I realize my parents were probably drunk all the time with me.

Yeah.

I'm sorry again.

Thanks.

Where are you staying?

Well, I... hadn't...

I guess I'll...

There's a new hotel on Highland that's... supposedly not too expensive and... and pretty nice.

Okay, I'll check it out.

Again, that's great about the MacArthur.

Thanks.

-Charlie?

-Yeah?

Thanks.

Fuck.

-What?

-She's being represented by Nora.

She's supposedly very fair?

All right, here's the fact, Jack.

I charge $950 an hour.

Ted is 400.

If you have a stupid question, you call Ted.

To start, we'll need a $25,000 retainer.

-That's more than I can —

-And all your financials.

We need to do a forensic accounting.

Which runs anywhere from ten to twenty thousand dollars.

But if we can all agree right away, it shouldn't get too bad, right?

You were married here in LA?

Yes... because her mom and sister are out here

-and I'm not close with my family.

-Your son was born out here?

Yes, because, again, her mom and sister are out here and I'm not —

So, you got married here, your kid was born here... and she served you here?

Yeah, but we lived in New York.

Why?

-Is there a problem?

-We'll have to reshape the narrative.

If you're serious about having your child in New York, this is what I suggest.

You take your kid...

D-Did you say his name was Fred?

Henry.

Henry?

Why did I say Fred?

I have a kid named Fred.

You take Henry to New York with you right now.

Then we file an action in New York.

We make this a New York case.

We need to make an argument you're a New York-based family.

Well, we are.

Otherwise, you'll probably never see your kid outside of LA again.

Really? No.

It's very hard to convince the courts to move a kid.

As soon as you let your wife and child leave New York, you made life very difficult for yourself.

Yes, but as I said, we're a New York family, that's just a fact.

She's... here temporarily.

Then why do you think she served you out here?

I don't... know, but Henry wants to go back to New York.

Don't quote your kid.

He's just telling you what you want to hear.

And trust me, he's telling her the opposite.

Let me have the Barber file!

It's right here.

Move my lunch to 1:30.

What's...

"Exit Goat"?

Exit Ghost. It's the name of my theater company.

You're a director?

Theater director, yeah.

-Anything I've seen?

-I don't know. What have you seen?

Our production of Electra is moving to Broadway... which is exciting.

We have to make sure that money is protected.

I mean, it's theater, so it's not a lot of money.

I basically put whatever money I make back in the theater.

I wonder, do we ask for support?

- Interesting.

- From Nicole?

I'm not going to do that.

Does your wife's family have money?

Her mother has some from her TV career.

And her father died.

Well, we could say that we don't want her mother to see the kid, draw her into the case.

In that instance, her mother could pay your legal fees.

No.

I'm very close to her mom.

-Nicole's family has been my family —

-Yeah, but that's going to change.

And I suggest you get used to it.

-We need to hire a private investigator.

-Really? I mean...

-Really?

-Does your wife do drugs or anything?

Coke?

Not in any real way.

Well, we're not going to win if she's the perfect mother.

She was addicted to TUMS for a while.



It wasn't nothing.

She was up to a tube a day.

Have you noticed anyone following you?

No.

Well, keep an eye out.

Look, you need to be prepared for the fact that Nora is going to portray you as a neglectful, absent father.

- But I'm not.

- You live in New York.

You're consumed with your work.

She and your kid are out here, struggling.

Nora's going to use that strategy.

I'm sure of it.

But Nicole's not going to lie.

Listen, if we start from a place of reasonable, and they start from a place of crazy, when we settle, we'll be somewhere between reasonable and crazy.

Which is still crazy.

Half of crazy is crazy.

You know what people say, "Criminal lawyers see bad people at their best, divorce lawyers see good people at their worst."

Before this is all over, you're going to hate me and Ted, just because of what we represent in your life.

I'm sure you're right.

So tell me the story again.

You came out here to see your kid.

-Maybe I'm not explaining this well.

-She serves you.

-We're friendly, we're fine.

-What a bitch.

We're just trying to figure this out.

She's not a bitch.

Thanks, but this isn't...

We're doing it a different way.

And... I can't even close to afford this.

I've got to get back to New York.

I have a Broadway play in rehearsals.

I was the hot shit at that time.

Young, very sexy, with a great head of hair.

I just so appreciate that Charlie gave me this opportunity.

Or maybe I should thank Nicole.

I heard Nicole's pilot went to series, so she's moving to LA.

And they put Henry in school out there.

Well, is Charlie moving too?

Not Charlie.

He won't abandon us.

And you can't do theater in LA.

Charlie said she and Henry are coming back to New York when she finishes filming her show.

I wouldn't be so sure.

Nicole was never going to stay in New York, that was obvious.

She was probably planning this move all along.

When she sees an opportunity, believe me, she takes it.

Well, LA is nice.

The space.

Miss Four Time Oscar winner, sucking my...

Okay, how is everyone today?

Nobody get too close.

I think I caught Donna's cold.

-Sorry, Charlie.

-I'm expecting a Skype call from Henry, so I might have to step out.

So, Charlie, what you're going through now is going to be horrible, but it will be over.

Thanks, Frank.

-Another thing.

-Yeah?

Fuck as many people as you can right now.

Women, men.

-Take what I said seriously.

-You might need help wrapping gauze.

-It needs to stay tight.

-Okay, I'm — I'm confused.

What... scene is the Invisible Man outfit for?

No, that's my Halloween costume.

And the Frankenstein is for Henry.

He's coming here this weekend.

We're going to trick or treat in the Slope.

I made it more James Whale than Kenneth Branagh.

-Perfect.

-Can I talk to you?

Yeah, over...

I've typed up the blocking from the last two rehearsals, and here are the director notes from that Danish production from the '70s.

Where'd you find it?

-The library, duh.

-Ha!

Can I come over tonight?

Mary Ann, it's too hard now.

I just can't be with anyone right now.

But we did it when you were married and we shouldn't have done it.

And now that you're not married, shouldn't we be doing it?

I'm not not married yet.

You're torturing yourself.

Just make sure everything doesn't go to hell.

-I'm relying on you, okay?

-Fine.

-Thanks.

-I wish you'd accept generosity better.

Hold on. Let me...

- Hello?

- Is this Charlie Barber?

Yes.

Hi, this is Nora Fanshaw.

I represent your wife, Nicole Barber.

- Hi.

- Do you have an attorney yet?

No.

Okay, then it is okay for me to talk to you directly, okay?

Okay.

I 'm calling because we haven't received your response to our filing.

Yeah, I've been rehearsing this play and flying back and forth to LA.

You're going to need to file your response.

- Nicole said there was no rush.

- It's been more than 30 days since you were served.

By law, you're meant to respond within 30 days.

I didn't like the first lawyer I met.

It says that very clearly on the document you were given.

Did you read it?

Yeah, but I thought that's just what it says.

We weren't even going to do it with lawyers.

Charlie, I think I shouldn't tuck in my shirt.

- Nicole said I could take my time.

- And we've let you take your time.

-Keeps coming out during the love scene.

-Could you hold a second? What love scene?

When I hug Beth.

You don't hug Beth.

I think it's something we should explore.

Can't you just tuck it in tighter or get Donna to safety pin it?

I also have a kind of a thing

- about, tucking things in.

- Charlie?

If you don't file your response, we 're going to file a request for default judgment against you.

...insecurities about my figure.

- Charlie?

- Yes, sorry.

Default judgment, what does that mean?

Don't hug Beth.

We 'll be able to lay claim to whatever we want.

W-What do you mean, whatever you want of what?

Your apartment, your things, everything you own.

We...

She and I already discussed this.

We don't own that much stuff.

She can have pretty much whatever she wants.

And it means we 'll set the number for child support at its highest level and claim full custody of your child.

Full custody?

- I mean, that's not even —

-This is what the law says.

Nicole's not going to do that.

I mean, she won't.

No, Charlie, l represent Nicole, and she's aware of everything

I'm saying to you.

I just spoke to her this morning.

Well, I spoke to her five minutes before I go! on the call.

Okay, so what do I do?

You need to get a lawyer and respond immediately.

Nicole wants to do this amicably, but you're leaving us no other option.

I'll get a lawyer.

Can I get a lawyer here?

- I don't know where "here " is.

- New York.

I That's what all that honking is ?

No, you'll have to come to LA and meet people in LA.

I'm rehearsing a —

If you don't respond in Los Angeles by Friday, you'll leave us no choice.

Wh — Which line?

I have to take this.

Can you hold on a second, Charlie ?

Me and Mommy are in the middle of a super secret treasure hunt.

-I thought the plane landed at nine.

-What are you wearing?

Sock pants.

It did. What are sock pants?

He doesn't like to feel the breeze on his legs.

He dressed himself.

-There are long pants. Can I talk to you?

-It's almost noon.

There was traffic. We've got to get going.

-Why don't we ever do a treasure hunt?

-Henry, can you wait a minute?

No talking alone.

Just one bit of talking alone, then I'll be right there.

I got a call from your lawyer.

She said you'd take everything and... custody and everything if I didn't respond.

It's better if we just let the lawyers do this.

Yeah, but she's saying things

I don't think you mean.

Henry, we need to get going.

I don't want to go now.

-Have you gotten a lawyer yet?

-That's what I'm here to do.

Come on, Henry. I'm in a rush.

I have three more clues.

Why did you start a treasure hunt or whatever so close to my arrival?

-Cool.

-You were late. We were killing time.

Honey, come. We're going to finish the treasure hunt later.

- I'm going to be rich!

- Okay.

You're going to go with your daddy.

It's going to be fun.

And I've got a present for you when you get back as a reward.

He's not going to the dentist.

-I'm trying to help.

-I'm staying here.

Come on.

Henry?

- Got the booster?

- I have a booster.

Wait, no, it's not in.

What's not in?

The seat's not connected.

I asked the rental company to install it.

Yeah, I think they can't for liability reasons.

-Do you know how these things —

-Let me just... If you...

- There should be a clip to clip onto.

- ...dig...

{effort grunts]

Fuck!

- Why "fuck?"

- Something sharp.

-Can't I stay with Mom?

-No.

Why not?

It's my time with you.

I just flew 3,000 miles.

I don't want to.

Henry, get in the fucking car!

I'm sorry, but Jesus, get in the fucking car.

How do you spell LEGO Bionicles?

That's two words.

What does LEGO start with?

Just tell me.

-Don't you want to learn it?

-No.

-It's on the box, anyway.

-L...

Then what?

E... You know, everyone at the theater says hi.

Hi.

Then what?

A "♪-♪-♪" sound.

-Are you excited for Halloween?

-J?

G-

- Then what?

- And an "O" sound.

-O?

-Are you excited for Halloween?

Yeah.

I brought both our costumes.

I'm going as a store-bought ninja.

But we agreed.

I had Donna make you a Frankenstein.

I don't want to be a Frankenstein anymore.

Are you sure?

Maybe just look at it.

It's awesome. We'll be Frankenstein and the Invisible Man.

Mom bought me a ninja costume, which is better because it costs more.

Technically, the Frankenstein cost more when you factor in Donna's time and the materials.

The cousins are also going to be ninjas.

But Henry, we went through all this trouble.

Okay.

Whatever you want.

Please take the ticket.

- Dad, you're too far.

- I know.

Please take the ticket.

So, I'm not comfortable leaving the bags in the car where I've given the key to someone

I don't really know.

I've been here.

It's an office building, so you've been to places like this before.

I remember those fish.

A lot of fish look the same.

Can I help you?

I'm Charlie Barber.

I have a 1:30 with Dan Cohen.

Hi. Where's your little man?

I don't have it this time.

I keep my skeletons at my mom's.

Okay.

Okay.

I'm sorry. We tried to reach you.

Mr. Cohen wanted me to apologize.

He can't see you because apparently your wife already met with him on the 7th of August about representation.

B-But she hired somebody else.

- ... Nora —

-Fanshaw?

But unfortunately, because she consulted with Mr. Cohen already, he's legally barred from representing you.

- Should we feed the fish?

- Yeah.

- it happens all the time.

- Really?

If you have a ticket,

I can validate your parking.

You know, it's common that people meet with as many lawyers as possible so that their spouse has limited options.

I don't think she would've done it deliberately.

You'd be surprised.

Can all of them, like, breathe out of the water?

Did you go to a lot of offices with your mom?

Not so many.

Like 11.

I don't think anyone would have stealed the bags, Daddy.

I need somebody today.

If I don't respond by tomorrow, she said I could lose custody.

I didn't know who else to call.

There's got to be someone she didn't meet.

I have a name for you.

Bert Spitz.

He was the entertainment lawyer at Roberta's agency.

Great.

But then he kind of got pushed into retirement a few years ago, and he went into family law.

-I called him.

-Thank you, G-ma.

- He can see you today at three.

- Aw, shit.

We never had this conversation,

Charlie-bird.

You got it. I love you.

- Aw.

- Dad!

-I need a new burger.

-Why?

Because you made us carry your bags into the restaurant, I dropped it.

That's fine. I'll give you mine.

Get in the car.

Why did you bring me today if you couldn't hang out with me?

Because I've been away and want to see you.

Jamie Tuber has a little sister...

...named, um, Lily Tuber.

-Yeah.

-And Lily Tuber is really bossy.

Getting divorced with a kid can be one of the hardest things you'll ever do.

It's like a death without a body.

I know personally.

I've been there four different times.

You've been divorced four times?

Married four times.

Three divorces.

This last one will stick, God willing.

That's why I graduated into family law, to help people survive this painful time.

Here's how I see it.

If we get bogged down in "who did this," and "who did that," and "I don't want to pay the two dollars," it'll just cost you more money and time and... emotional stress, and you'll probably end up with the same result anyway.

Right.

I mean, I agree with that philosophy.

She does too, I'm sure.

And I always go with the truth, no matter where that takes us.

You know, most people in my business make up the truth so they can get where they need to go.

You're just transactions to them.

L-I like to think of you as people.

Okay, good.

And not just you, her too.

Yes.

You know, this can be a really ugly process.

But I also believe it doesn't have to be terrible.

I'm glad to hear you say that.

Um...

I'd love to keep expenses down as much as possible.

Of course you do.

I charge 450 an hour and I need a $10,000 retainer to start.

I'll see if I can get an advance on the Broadway transfer.

And keep in mind, you'll have to pay for her lawyer.

I didn't...

- What?

- Well, at least part of her.

It doesn't make sense, does it?

I mean, you're doing this because you love your kid.

And in doing so, you're draining money from your kid's education.

- It seems ridiculous.

- It is.

It is, boy.

We'll have to respond right away.

Your son goes to school out here?

Yeah, temporarily. We agreed.

Her pilot went to series and I wanted to accommodate her, as she's often felt we do things on my terms.

Be a better husband in divorce.

I guess something like that, but we live in New York.

Well, with your kid going to school out here, the court may see it differently.

Will we go to court?

No, no, we don't want to go to court.

The courts in California are a disaster.

No, that's just how we have to think about it.

I'm not sure these are my glasses.

Where are you living while you're here?

I'm in a hotel right now.

No, a hotel doesn't look good.

-To who?

-The court.

You just said we weren't going to go to court.

No, of course, of course.

We have to prepare to go to court, hoping we don't go to court.

Okay.

You should get a place in LA.

And get a place near her.

It looks better for custody reasons.

She's in West Hollywood.

That'll be expensive.

L-I guess I could rent our New York apartment.

Don't rent it.

You have to continue to prove

New York residence.

And of course, if you have a place in LA, it's hard to show you all live in New York, isn't it?

So... what do I do?

I recommend you spend as much time as you can with your son.

Many people fight for that time, then they don't even use it.

They just want to win.

This shouldn't be that complicated, right?

I mean, we're a New York family.

I think it's all pretty straightforward.

Right?

I hope so, yes.

I see no reason...

You both love your child.

You respect each other.

Why this shouldn't be relatively pain-free.

Right.

I think you have my glasses.

That makes sense.

- What have you been doing?

- Reading this magazine.

You were reading California Lawyer?

Yeah.

Okay, I'm almost done.

I wouldn't expect too much from that cat.

-What kind of pet do you want?

-I don't know...

I want you to know that eventually this will all be over, and whatever we win or lose... it'll be the two of you having to figure this out together.

Thank you.

You're the first person in this process who's spoken to me like a human.

You remind me of myself on my second marriage.

Come! Come! Come! Come!

You have fun with Daddy?

We drove around to offices.

Do you want to see your ninja costume?

It's on G-ma's bed.

-Yeah!

-Yeah.

You know, I had Donna build him this whole Frankenstein thing with the plugs and —

Yeah, well, the cousins are ninjas, so he wanted to do that —

But he and I had decided together.

Well, I can't make him be Frankenstein.

I'm not asking you to, but maybe you can help me out a little.

I'll leave the Frankenstein here, maybe you can nudge him in that direction.

I'll try.

What's the...

Did you dye your hair again?

Is that for your show?

No, this is me. it was this way when I saw you before.

I know, but I didn't say anything then.

You don't like it?

No, I guess it's fine.

Is it shorter? I prefer longer, but...



Sorry, it's just absurd.

Is everything okay?

Yeah. Why?

You seem, I don't know, like something is —

Everything's fine.

Okay, I'm going to check in at the hotel, but I should be able to get to you guys by 5:00, 5:30 —

We're going to Cassie's in Pasadena and trick-or-treating with the cousins.

Cassie lives in Pasadena now?

Yes. She and Sam moved there a couple months ago.

Okay, I don't really know Pasadena.

-I'll figure it out. What's the address?

-My mom is looking forward to it...

-I'll text Sam.

-...and Cassie and Sam are mad.

-Mad at who?

-You.

- Cassie and Sam?

- You can understand that.

So, I think we should probably do separate Halloweens.

But if you're okay with it, then shouldn't they be okay with it?

-Let's do it this way this time.

-Do you not want me there?

I'm fine with it.

- Okay.

- It'll be nice for him.

He'll have two Halloweens.

What am I going to do with him for second

Halloween? Walk around Sunset Boulevard?

Maybe the hotel has something. Or you can drive to a different neighborhood.

The sun sets forever.

There shall never be another dawn.

No!

Lady...

I require the solace of the shadows... and the dark!

Okay, ready for Halloween?

-Hi.

-Wow, elaborate.

Sweetheart, don't forget to wear your jacket. It's getting colder.

- This is a nice house.

- Ready to go back out?

- He has to pee.

- No, I don't.

He does.

Some of his men are in here and also Bear-Bear.

You can keep that Bear-Bear, because I got another one.

Does he know that there are two Bear-Bears?

-It was his idea.

-David Bowie, right? Station to Station?

Let's Dance.

Henry, have a great Halloween with Daddy, okay?

Have fun.

Go pee and then we're going back out.

I'm too tired.

Go pee, and then we're going to go drive to Halloween.

This block looks promising.

I wish Halloween was over.

Well, it isn't.

If we were in New York, we could be walking.

But I like that we're sitting right now.

I like to sit.

That's true, Los Angeles does have sitting going for it.

I think that's why

I like Los Angeles better.

Because you get to sit?

And because I like my friends here better.

That's not true.

What about Horatio and Poppy?

Horatio doesn't like me anymore.

And I don't like Poppy.

Here, I have Axel.

Axel's hilarious.

I think you'd like him, Dad.

And my family's here.

Besides you.

Everyone's asleep.

I need to pee!

Who gave you a lighter?

Lift the seat.

I'm going to have to go back to New York on Monday.

Did you flush?

Wash your hands.

Will you play with me?

I'm tired, honey.

Did you hear me?

I have to go back to New York.

Watch out!

Whoosh! I'm falling!

You didn't catch me.

Okay?

Why aren't you here more?

I have to work.

You know my play is opening on Broadway.

Is it because you don't want to be near Mom?

No. You know, like we talked about, we both decided not to be together no matter where we are, but we both want to be with you.

But you're not near me if you're in New York.

Well, we all still live in New York.

Yeah, but I go to school here.

Just for right now.

Like that time we were in Copenhagen for my play.

Remember all those kids in buckets?

I like my school here, and Mom says we could stay here if we want.

What do you mean?

She said that?

Yeah.

Vroom.

Aah!

- Hello?

- Are you moving out here?

- Did you find a lawyer?

- Yes. Henry says you're moving here.

Have your lawyer call Nora.

I want to talk about it as us.

Who the fuck is "us"?

Let's just get in a room, you and me.

That's what we always said we'd do.

-My lawyers wouldn't let me sign anything.

-It's our divorce.

They say I could later sue them for malpractice.

What am I walking into?

What are you walking into?

Yes, what the fuck is going on?

I read your fucking e-mails, Charlie!

I read them all.

- When?

- I don't know, recently.

- Shit.

- You're a fucking liar.

-You fucked Mary Ann!

-It was after I was sleeping on the couch.

All this bullshit about working on us.

You know what? I have been working.

I've been doing the work alone.

How did you read my e-mails?

I hacked into your account, you dumb fuck!

I think that's illegal!

Don't give me this shit about being surprised about LA.

Surprise! I have my own opinions.

How do you even know how to do something like that?

Surprise! I want things that aren't what you want, because, surprise, you were fucking another lady.

It was one time! I think you're conflating two different things.

Mary Ann has nothing to do with LA.

I am conflating, motherfucker!

You watch me conflate!

Did you just stamp your foot?

I don't think I've ever done that before.

I'm just so angry.

- You look like you needed one.

- Yes, I do, thanks.

You know, the Japanese are making really interesting tequila right now.

That's exciting, I guess.

-What are you so angry about?

-My fucking ex-husband.

I spent all this time feeling guilty, and he's so self-absorbed.

It's pointless.

It's a game I'm playing with myself.

Hey, Pablo. We met at —

-You held the bounce board.

-The flirty grip.

-Here's what I want you to only do, okay?

-What?

-I want you to finger me.

-What?

-Just finger me.

-Okay.

That's all we're going to do, just fingering. Okay?

I'm changing my whole fucking life.

Nicole and Charlie's son, Henry, was born here in Los Angeles.

He currently attends Laurel Elementary in Laurel Canyon, and Nicole works in Hollywood while also maintaining a full schedule as a mother with classes of swim, art, gym, and music, as well as play groups.

Nicole is Henry's primary custodial parent, and to the extent that Charlie would like to exercise his custodial time, he should be making efforts to visit Henry here in California.

Nora, you seem to be ignoring the fact that they lived in New York for ten years.

My client worked in New York for several years, that's true.

But Nicole was born and bred right here in LA.

She and Charlie would come here most holidays and summers to spend time with her family, who all live in LA.

She and Charlie were married in LA.

Would you like to see the photos?

No, I don't need to see the photos.

Although I'm sure they both look beautiful.

It's my client's expectation that after this TV show is completed, the parties will move back to New York where they currently keep an apartment.

And it's my understanding that Charlie promised Nicole that they would spend more time in Los Angeles during the marriage.

But because of his insistence that his work keep them in New York,

Nicole ended up staying there much longer than she ever anticipated.

In fact, a few years ago,

Charlie was offered a residency at the Geffen Playhouse that would have taken his work and his family to Los Angeles for a year.

And he, um... turned it down.

Even though that was Nicole's desire.

He wanted to maintain consistency for his family and his child.

Was this the same consistency he wanted to maintain when they went to Copenhagen for six months so he could direct a play?

Now, while I understand

Charlie lives in New York... and when it's convenient to his work schedule, he flies out to see his son...

He flies out here every chance he gets, at great expense.

I don't see any reason you can't be out here full time.

He makes his living in New York.

-Sorry, do we want to contemplate lunch?

-Good idea.

I'll order now so it'll come when we're all hungry.

Yeah.

- Everyone good with Manny's?

- I'd love Manny's.

Have you had Manny's?

You'll love it.

Just really yummy sandwiches and salads.

I'll have the BLT.

Dad?

Turkey.

I'll have the BLT.

-You'll have the kale?

-Kale salad.

I don't know, sorry.

Charlie will have, um... the Greek salad, but with lemon and olive oil instead of the Greek dressing.

Okay.

- I'll have the Chinese chicken salad.

- Okay, sure.

-Thank you.

-Yeah.

Congratulations, Charlie, on your grant.

Nicole told me.

Thank you.

He's a genius.

Well, I told Nicole

I loved your play.

- Really.

- Thanks.

You are one smart cookie.

Thanks.

I would just love to...

Crawl inside that brain.

There was that one moment when you smell the toast, smell.

It was literally my favorite thing that I saw that year.

- Thanks.

- Truly genius.

Thank you.

I was sorry to hear it closed on Broadway.

They couldn't smell the toast.

It was so emotional.

Laughs]

It's very competitive, I imagine.

Now, when Charlie is in Los Angeles,

Nicole, of course, agrees that it will be best for Henry that he see each parent equally.

It's very nice out here, Charlie.

You should give it a chance.

Yeah, and the space... you can't beat it.

I love it too.

But all of our personal feelings about the two cities aside, we don't share your assertion that the couple is an LA-based family.

It was very clearly their deal that they would go back to New York after Nicole finished her show.

I'm not aware of any deal.

Well, I didn't get it in writing.

Charlie, is this like the deal that you made that you and Nicole would spend more time in LA during your marriage?

We didn't have a deal.

It was something we discussed.

But...

So, it's a deal when it's something you want and a discussion when Nicole wants it?

Sidebar...

Nora, do you have a spare office where Charlie and I can sidebar?

Sure.

-Can you, um...

-I can show you.

Come on.

Nora is a very good lawyer.

-Tough, right?

-Yeah.

And you're in a bind because you've shown you're willing to fly out here and rent an apartment to see your son.

-You told me to do that.

-I know that.

And I'm doing that because I want to see my kid, not to set a precedent.

Yes, but unfortunately, you are setting a precedent.

And a judge might look at it that way.

What's the alternative? I stay in New York and never come out here?

No, because then it would look to the court like you don't care about seeing your son.

Court or no court? Stop saying "court" and then "never court."

Well, the way this is going, we may have to go to court.

-Are you aware of how maddening you sound?

-I am.

And I know it seems unfair.

But imagine if you were... a poor mother whose husband abandons her, and then refuses to pay anything.

That's what the system is trying to protect people from.

Listen... if I were representing you —

You are representing me.

Right, no, of course. No...

I don't see a judge moving this child from California.

I think we try and settle today.

Settle meaning what?

She gets LA.

No, Bert, just...

No.

I mean, we have to win this.

Remember, the win is what's best for Henry.

And if you guys go to court, he's going to get pulled into it.

But if he stays here and I stay in New York, that's just... then I won't...

I'll never get to really be his parent again.

It'll be different.

It won't exist.

So maybe you move here.

You heard what Amir said about the space.

Fuck the space, Bert! Fuck the space!

I'll do whatever you want me to do, but this is my advice.

I've seen these things go on and on, and the burden of these battles is immeasurable.

I had a client get colon cancer and die before he and his wife came to agreement.

What about filing in New York?

It's too late.

And even if you did,

I don't think it would matter.

They're being reasonable financially, you know?

You're — You're lucky they didn't ask for half your grant money.

She wouldn't do that. She knows

I put all that money back in my theater.

If this continues, she might.

The actors and crew all rely on that money.

The court would never agree with this, right?

Whether they do or not, it'll cost you half your grant money to go to court and prove it.

I feel like a criminal.

But you didn't commit any crime.

It doesn't feel that way.

If we give on LA right now, and then try to make the best deal possible,

I think we can get her to give on other fronts.

There are no other fronts!

This is the thing!

He needs to know that I fought for him!

He'll know.

I should never have let her come out here with Henry.

If it wasn't LA and New York, it'd be something else.

You'd be fighting about a house, or a school district, or...

You know what this is like?

This is like that joke about the woman at the hairdresser, she's going to Rome.

-Do you know this?

-I don't.

This woman is at her hairdresser and she says,

"I'm going to Rome on holiday."

And he says, "Really?

What... what airline are you taking?"

She says, "Alitalia."

He says, "Alitalia? Are you crazy?

That's the worst...

That's terrible. Don't take that."

He says, "Where are you going to stay?"

She says, "I'm going to stay at the Hassler."

"The Hassler? What, are you kidding?

They're renovating the Hassler.

You'll hear hammering all night long.

You won't sleep.

What are you going to see?"

She says, "I think I'm going to try to go to the Vatican."

"The Vatican?

You'll be standing in line all day long.

You'll never get to see anything —"

I'm sorry, Bert, am I paying for this joke?

Whatever happens here, it's temporary.

He's growing up. He's going to have opinions on the subject.

Time is on your side, Charlie.

Maybe he'll do college on the East Coast.

I have most of my coins, like my quarters and dimes, at Daddy's...

- Right.

- ...but I'm keeping my dollars and my one twenty at yours, okay?

So, that is one twenty plus 50, what is that?

Goddamn it.

What's "Goddamn it"?

Did you guys lose power where you are?

Dad? Did we lose power?

No.

There is rolling blackouts in the hills and no w...

Damn it.

Now the gate won't close.

Her gate won't close.

Morn!

Hey.

- Can we go see my room?

- Yeah, of course.

-You tried all the —

-I tried everything.

Sorry I made you come out.

It's fine.

-I just —

-You don't want your gate open.

Right.

-There should be a panel or something —

-Maybe this is something here.

- It's a cute house.

- Yeah.

I mean, from what I can see.

Thanks.

You're getting shaggy.

Yeah, I have to find a hair cutter.

You want me to cut it?

Okay.

Close your eyes.

He's out.

Maybe he should stay here tonight.

It's my night.

Hey, come on. We're going.

Come on. Let's take a walk. Right?

Yeah, we're going to take a walk.

-We're taking a walk.

-Fine, all right. She's crazy.

We're mostly finished.

Bert and I hammered out

90 percent of the details, and there's a couple minor things hanging, but it should be easy.

And then the judge makes your divorce official.

That's good.

- Fuck me.

- What?

Who's that?

Charlie shouldn't have done this.

What do you mean? Where's Bert?

This means that everything we've agreed upon now is off the table.

We've got LA, right?

Not with Jay Marotta representing him.

This is a street fight now.

And I'm going to have to ask for things that we wouldn't normally ask for.

This system rewards bad behavior.

.Jay-

- Hey!

Hi.

I saw Miriam at Madeo the other night.

-Yeah?

-Looking very handsome.

You know, you should come to our Stand Up To Cancer event.

- John Legend's going to play.

- Love him.

Okay? It's going to be at the Beverly Hilton, I think.

- Great.

- Okay?

She said you're spending more time in Malibu.

- Really?

- Me too.

I haven't seen her since that building was ICM.

A little history...

Ten years ago, Charlie takes a risk when he first hires Nicole as an actress in his play in New York City.

He's a well-regarded up-and-coming director of the avant-garde.

And she's known as the girl in that college sex movie who takes her top off.

-My client will not be slut-shamed...

-Ten years on...

...for an artistic choice.

...and many prestigious theater roles later... she becomes an actress of great credibility.

And it's because of that credibility, that she's offered the lead role in a major television show.

This new opportunity is thanks to Charlie.

Your Honor, we shouldn't have to pay support money at this point.

In fact, Charlie is entitled to half her TV money, present and future earnings of the show.

Charlie's just received the enormous sum of $650,000 in the form of a MacArthur grant.

-Of which he gets...

-This is for the theater work...

-...he conducted during the marriage.

-...in 125,000 installments

...over five years.

-So by Jay's same logic, this is work...

-He uses the money...

-...that Nicole contributed to.

-to employ actors and crew members...

-One at a time, please.

-...and to pay debts that he's accumulated with his theater company that stars his wife.

- Bless you.

- Not only did she turn down a lucrative and successful career in movies to perform in his little theater, but she actually supplied Charlie with a loan early on to help out.

-Which he paid back.

-She lent her name to the marquee, which was the principle reason people came to the theater.

That may have been true ten years ago.

And in turn, she helped establish Charlie's reputation.

Now, over the next ten years, she was subsequently offered parts in movies, TV shows, most of which she turned down at Charlie's behest to be a mom and act in his plays.

So, while we are willing to be flexible on support, we contend that half of Charlie's grant money be split between the parties.

I don't see how you can claim that she gets half a grant dedicated to his genius.

He became a genius during the marriage.

Come on, Nora.

Charlie himself, upon hearing that he received the prize, told Nicole that it belonged to her too.

That's what people say when they win awards.

No, he was implying what was true.

His genius was an intangible asset built during the marriage.

Nora, I like how you refer to Charlie's theater as a ramshackle downtown dump when you're arguing custody, but when you want more money, he's a big, rich, genius

Broadway director.

You can't have it both ways.

Really? Why not?

And whether you think it's fair or not, Jay, the first monetary installment from the MacArthur grant was put into a joint marital account, and thus became communal property.

Fuck. You shouldn't have put that money in a joint account.

There's not going to be anything left, anyway. I'm using it all to divorce her.

Nora, I have to say that your account of this marriage takes place in an alternate reality.

By suddenly moving to LA and insisting on an LA residence,

Nicole is withholding Henry...

- Counsel, please be seated.

- ...alienating him from his father, which has turned Charlie's world upside down.

- Counselor?

- It amounts to an ambush.

"Withholding," Jay? Really? "Alienating"?

Well, those are fighting words, and it's simply false and does nothing to further this settlement.

Your recap of this situation is outrageous.

And although California is, without doubt, a no-fault state, it bears mentioning in the accurate recap of this situation that Charlie had had extramarital affairs.

-An extramarital affair.

-Do you really want me to go there?

- Yeah, let's go there.

- Okay.

Nicole has admitted to hacking Charlie's computer and reading his e-mails, which, if proven, is a felony.

And, Nora,

I don't think you'd be too happy if I ask Nicole about her alcohol consumption in the evenings.

What?

She confided in Charlie one night recently, having just carried Henry to bed, that she was having trouble standing while walking down the staircase.

And from what I understand, this is not an isolated event.

So you let me know, Nora,

-and we will go there as needed.

-Charlie?

Can I ask you, how do you expect to have more time with Henry when you don't exercise the time you already have, and exercise it responsibly?

On a recent visit to Los Angeles, after failing to call, text, communicate in any way, shape, or form,

Charlie finally arrived two hours late to pick up Henry at Nicole's mother's house.

At that point, the car seat, which he had assured Nicole had been professionally installed, was clearly not even belted in.

-It was just sitting in the back seat.

-You have to buckle in the car seat.

-It's the law.

-I know.

-I thought the rental place did it.

-They can't. It's a liability.

I know that now.

Once we discovered that, we fixed it.

Counsel?

You can see my courtroom is full and there are people who don't have the resources your clients have, and I'm fairly certain you haven't exhausted, in good faith, the arguments in the case of this child.

In the meantime, we'll keep the status quo.

This remains an LA family for the time being.

I took over this department recently, and I'm still becoming acquainted with the cases.

So, I'm going to appoint an expert evaluator who knows much more about young children than I do.

Once the evaluation is done, we'll modify the orders where necessary.

Hey.

Hey, where's Henry?

He's with Cassie and her kids at laser tag.

You want something to drink?

I have unfiltered tap water, beer, and some juice boxes.

I'll take a juice box.

You don't have anything on the walls?

I don't have anything to put on them except Henry's art, which is being framed.

I can give you some stuff, you know, until you get some things.

How about that great picture of Henry on the Staten Island Ferry?

Aren't you in that one?

-I guess I... You could... cut me out.

-I'm gonna have to leave a day early to go to New York on the 22nd.

So I was wondering if I could take Henry that Friday.

The 22nd. So, that's the 21st?

We have plans, actually.

We're going to, um, some thing at LACMA with the cousins.

But could you change it so I could take him?

It's just one night.

-He's looking forward to it.

-Really?

It's my night, Charlie, we negotiated it.

Okay, fine.

But what?

No, I'm just asking you to be flexible.

I am flexible. You come in and out and I adjust based on your schedule.

-This one night we have tickets to —

-It's not only this one night, but fine.

-Henry's teacher wants to meet with us.

-You mean his LA teacher?

Can you, answer the e-mail so we could set a time?

Yeah, I've been distracted.

I understand.

They just want to rule out everything, you know, with his reading.

I just think he's a little overanxious.

I think he wants it too much.

They said he's off the charts in math.

He quits too easily when things aren't easy for him.

You know, he's like us, he's stubborn.

He's still a lousy Monopoly player because he tries to save all his money.

Laughs]

Laughs]

So...

I thought we should talk.

I feel like maybe things have gone too far.

I mean, my mom's taking out a loan against the house to help me pay Nora.

I thought I paid Nora.

You pay 30 percent of Nora.

Well, I'm going broke too, if that's any help.

I've just agreed to direct two shitty plays, and we can forget putting anything away for Henry's college.

It's just that up until now, we've been able to keep Henry somewhat removed, and this will change that.

We have to protect him.

I agree.

Nora says that the evaluator will come into our homes, they're going to interview Henry in addition to us, our friends, family, enemies, and then they'll observe us with him, how we are as parents.

- Sounds awful.

- I know.

I feel like if anybody observed me on any given day as a mom, I'd never get custody.

That was a joke.

- I know. I feel the same way.

- Right.

So...

Maybe we can figure something out between us.

You remember I said this to you at the beginning?

I know you did, but these are different circumstances.

I was anticipating these circumstances.

Anyway, shall we try this?

Okay.

I don't know how to start.

Do you understand why I want to stay in LA?

No.

Well... That's not...

Charlie, that's not a useful way for us to start.

I don't understand it.

You don't remember promising that we could do time here?

We discussed things.

We were married, we said things.

We talked about moving to Europe.

About getting a... sideboard, or what do you call it?

A credenza, to fill the empty space behind the couch.

We never did any of it.

You turned down the residency at the Geffen that would've brought us here for a — a year.

It wasn't something I wanted.

We had a great theater company and a great life where we were.

-You call that a great life?

-You know what I mean.

I don't mean we had a great marriage.

I mean, life in Brooklyn.

Professionally.

I don't know. Honestly,

I never considered anything different.

Well, that's the problem, isn't it?

I mean, I was your wife.

You should've considered my happiness too.

Come on, you were happy.

You've just decided you weren't now.

Okay. Okay.

Let's...

M-My work is here now, my family is here.

And I agreed to put Henry in school here because your show went to series.

I did that knowing that when you were done shooting, he'd come back to New York.

Honey, we never said that.

That may have been your assumption, but we never expressly said that.

- We did say it.

- When did we say it?

I don't know when we said it, but we said it.

-I thought —

-We said it that time on the phone!

Honey, let me finish. Sorry.

I keep saying that.

I thought that if Henry was happy here, and my show continued, that we might do LA for a while.

I was not privy to that thought process.

The only reason we didn't live here is because you can't imagine desires other than your own, unless they're forced on you.

Okay, you wish you hadn't married me, you wish you had a different life, but this is what happened.

-So, what do we do?

-I don't know.

Nora says there's no coming back from this.

Fuck Nora! I hate fucking Nora telling me I always lived in LA even though I never lived in LA.

How could you have her say those things about me?

Jay said them about me too.

You shouldn't have fired Bert.

I needed my own asshole.

Let's just both agree both of our lawyers said shitty stuff about both of us.

Nora was worse.

Jay called me an alcoholic.

You pulled the rug out from under me and you're putting me through hell.

You put me through hell during our marriage.

Is that what that was, hell?

And now you're going to put Henry through this horrible thing

-so you can yet again get what you want!

-It's not what I want.

I mean, it's what I want, but it's what was... was... what's best for him.

Well, I was wondering when you'd get around to Henry and what he wants.

Fuck off!

No, you fuck off!

If you'd listen to your son, or anyone, then he'd tell you that he'd rather live here!

Stop putting your feelings about me onto Henry.

He tells me he likes it better here.

He tells you because he knows it's what you want to hear!

He tells me you're on the phone all the time. You don't play with him.

Because I'm going through a divorce in LA and trying to direct a play in New York!

Which closed because I wasn't there.

It was a huge opportunity for me...

You're fighting for something you don't even want!

And I let everyone down.

You're being so much like your father.

Do not compare me to my father!

I didn't compare you to him.

I said you were acting like him.

You're exactly like your mother.

Everything you were complaining about her, you're doing. You're suffocating Henry.

First of all, I love my mother.

She was a wonderful mother.

-I'm just repeating what you told me.

-Secondly, how dare you compare my mothering to my mother!

I may be like my father, but I am not like my mother!

You are!

And you're like my father!

You're also like my mother!

You're all the bad things about all of these people!

But mostly your mother.

When we would lie in bed together, sometimes I would look at you and see her and just feel so gross!

-I felt repulsed when you touched me!

-You're a slob.

I made all the beds, closed all the cabinets...

The thought of having sex with you makes me want to peel my skin off.

You'll never be happy, in LA or anywhere.

You'll think you found some better opposite guy than me, and in a few years, you'll rebel against him because you need to have your voice, but you don't want a voice.

You just want to fucking complain about not having a voice!

I think about being married to you, and that woman is a stranger to me.

-I mean, we had a child's marriage.

-You've regressed.

You've gone back to your life before you met me, it's pathetic.

People used to tell me that you were too selfish to be a great artist.

And I used to defend you.

They were absolutely right.

All your best acting is behind you.

You're back to being a hack!

You gaslighted me!

You're a fucking villain!

You want to present yourself as a victim because it's a good legal strategy?

Fine, but you and I both know you chose this life!

You wanted it until you didn't!

You used me so you could get out of LA.

I didn't use you.

You did, and then you blamed me for it!

You always made me aware of what I was doing wrong, how I was falling short!

Life with you was joyless!

What, so then you had to go and fuck someone else?

You shouldn't be upset that I fucked her!

You should be upset that I had a laugh with her!

Do you love her?

No.

But she didn't hate me. You hated me.

You hated me.

You fucked somebody we worked with.

You stopped having sex with me in the last year.

I never cheated on you.

That was cheating on me!

But there was so much I could have done.

I was a director in my twenties who came from nothing and was suddenly on the cover of fucking Time Out New York!

I was hot shit and I wanted to fuck everybody and I didn't.

And I loved you and I didn't want to lose you.

But I'm in my twenties, and I didn't want to lose that too, and I kinda did!

And you wanted so much so fast.

I didn't even want to get married.

And fuck it!

There's so much I didn't do.

- Thanks for that!

- You're welcome!

I can't believe

I have to know you forever!

You're fucking insane!

And you're fucking winning!

Are you kidding me?

I wanted to be married.

I'd already lost!

You didn't love me as much as I loved you!

What does that have to do with LA?

What?

You're so merged with your own selfishness, you don't even identify it as selfishness anymore!

You're such a dick!

Every day I wake up and I hope you're dead!

Dead, like if I could guarantee

Henry would be okay,

I'd hope you'd get an illness, and then get hit by a car and die!

God!

I'm sorry.

Me too.

Okay. No, we can make this nice.

Um, I would take the smaller plants and put them by the window.

And, do you have things we can put on the walls?

All right, that's it.

Thank you very much.

We miss you, and it looks great, really.

-Let us know how it goes, okay?

-All right.

I'll see you guys on, on Monday.

- Love you.

- All right, love you too. Bye.

Why do we have so many plants all of a sudden?

We'll have to return some of that stuff, so don't get too used to it.

I find plants kind of scary.

These plants are good guys.

Hey, come here.

Yeah?

Tomorrow, this woman is going to come and visit us... and be with us while we eat dinner.

-Is it your girlfriend?

-No,no.

-Is it Mommy's boyfriend?

-No. Why? Does Mommy have a boyfriend?

I don't know. Does she?

-I don't know.

-I don't know.

Why is someone watching us eat dinner?

I know, it's weird.

It's just something we have to do.

Which has to do with...

Mommy and me figuring out everything... and how we're going to be.

Um...

You know?

Will you read to me?

Sure. Grab your book.

Do you use drugs or alcohol?

I drink alcohol.

How much alcohol do you drink?

I don't know, a glass of wine with dinner.

- Sometimes more.

- How much more?

It's... Sometimes a... a few...

I... sometimes split a bottle of wine with someone.

- Okay, who do you split it with?

- I mean... if I'm having dinner with someone and we order a bottle of wine.

- Okay.

- You know, like at a restaurant.

When you say, "Do you want to go by the glass or do we get a bottle?"

- You get a bottle?

- Well, sometimes.

I mean, sometimes I go by the glass.

You know, it depends.

Did you mean drugs ever?

I have done drugs.

In college.

- Anything since you've been —

-I... I don't do it regularly.

Anything since you've been a mother?

Pot a few times.

Coke once at a party.

I mean, Henry wasn't with me.

What would you say are your strengths as a parent?

I listen.

I play-

I-I put in the time. I... love... taking care of him... watching him grow.

And sometimes... what they say about "it goes so fast" is true, but... sometimes it's not.

Sometimes it goes too slow, honestly.

What are your weaknesses?

I'm too precise. I care too much.

Are those weaknesses?

Maybe not.

You know, he can be an asshole and...

I can get really pissed off, and I'll call him on being an asshole —

I'm going to stop you there.

When you do this for real, don't ever say that.

People don't accept mothers who drink too much wine and yell at their child and call him an asshole.

I get it. I do it too.

We can accept an imperfect dad.

Let's face it, the idea of a good father was only invented like 30 years ago.

Before that, fathers were expected to be silent and absent and unreliable and selfish, and we can all say we want them to be different.

But on some basic level, we accept them.

We love them for their fallibilities, but people absolutely don't accept those same failings in mothers.

We don't accept it structurally and we don't accept it spiritually.

Because the basis of our Judeo-Christian whatever is Mary, Mother of Jesus, and she's perfect.

She's a virgin who gives birth, unwaveringly supports her child and holds his dead body when he's gone.

And the dad isn't there.

He didn't even do the fucking.

God is in heaven.

God is the father, and God didn't show up.

So, you have to be perfect, and Charlie can be a fuck up and it doesn't matter.

You will always be held to a different, higher standard.

And it's fucked up, but that is the way it is.

Ooh! Whoosh!

I think I rang the wrong bell.

Nancy Katz.

Hi, I'm Charlie Barber.

Henry's just playing in his room.

Nancy, can I get you anything?

Um, I'm easy. A glass of water?

It's a new apartment.

Shall we go in here?

Sure.

Um...

Um, what's a day like for the two of you here?

Well, if he has school,

I take him there, of course, and pick him up, assuming I can do both.

What prevents you from picking him up?

Um...

You know, work. I'm preparing a play

I'm directing in a few months.

What is that?

Kasimir und Karoline by ("Ödön von Horváth.

We're doing it at the Barrow in New York.

So, you have to be away?

Yes, recently, since Nicole's been working on the show in LA,

I come back and forth a lot.

- That sounds difficult.

- It is.

And expensive. I'll try to take him with me some of the time, but Nicole doesn't like for him to fly so much.

Well, that can be hard on a child, all that recycled air.

Well, he's sturdy.

Some parents won't take their kids to a restaurant because of these superbugs.

I noticed on one visit to Los Angeles, you came on a Sunday and left on a Thursday.

Why not stay for a weekend?

Um, on that time,

I had tech for Electra in New York.

What's that?

It was my Broadway debut.

I don't know what "tech" is.

It's the technical part of the production.

You figure out the lights.

-And Monday's our day off.

-What's a weekend day like?

Well, out here, he has basketball on Saturday at 12.

Eleven, I'm sorry.

And so, we go there.

And then, afterwards... maybe we'll get lunch somewhere, and then, if there's a movie to see...

Does he like basketball?

He does.

His coach, Rick, says he's a good dribbler, and I've seen that.

Ron.

Sorry, his coach's name is Ron.

Rick's his dentist in New York.

Well, you know our home home was — is in New York.

That's where we live.

New York is a long way from here.

Well, we like it because we can walk.

You can walk here.

Not really.

And the space...

Do you like your school?

I love it.

What's your favorite part about it?

I don't know.

Maybe gym“-

You like math.

Not anymore.

-Thanks.

-You're welcome.

- But you're getting really good at it.

- No.

Well, you are, but...

What do you and your dad like to do together?

When I'm at my dad's, we sometimes watch a movie, or build a LEGO, or something.

My dad's a great LEGO builder.

And at your mom's?

At home, I have most of my toys, and there's a pool, and I have a tree house and jungle gym.

We have super secret treasure hunt, which is really fun.

-Sweetheart?

-Army men ride in here and —

Want to help me set the table?

Do I have to?

-Just come in here and grab a plate.

-I'm playing.

Henry?

Okay.

Fine.

-Why are you being like this?

-What?

If I ask you to help out, help out.

-What is this?

-Special Meal.

What are the green things?

There aren't green things in Special Meal.

It's just a garnish.

I'll take it off.

I don't want to eat anything it touched.

-It doesn't change the taste of anything.

-I might want to be a vegetarian.

Mom's a vegetarian.

Is she a vegetarian now?

-Yeah.

-Well, then, you should like garnish.

It's all garnish, vegetarianism.

I'm done with my water.

Sure I can't get you anything?

No, I'm fine, thank you.

Do the thing with the knife.

No, I'm not.

No.

Come on.

It's not a dinner thing.

It's not an anytime thing.

What's the thing with the knife?

It's hilarious.

No, it's dumb.

I have a small knife on my key chain, which is only for adults.

And I do a thing with it sometimes.

You said I could get a knife.

A jackknife, yeah, when you're older.

Like ten.

No, like 20.

Yeah.

Dime, rime, lime, pime, sime...

Honey, stop guessing.

You're so close. Stay with it.

I don't want to do it.

- What's the first letter?

- I don't want to do it. Can I do the iPad?

No, look. What's the first letter?

-I don't want to.

-It's a T. What sound does T make?

-Tuh.

-Right. Then just do the rest of it.

Dime.

No.

You have "tuh" and "ime." What is that?

Time.

It's time.

It's time.

You'll see, honey.

One day, it's just going to click and you'll be able to read everything.

I need a break.

Can I go play in my room?

Sure.

Hey.

Yeah?

Do you ever observe married people?

No. Why would I?

I was kidding.

The knife thing is...

I carry this knife on my key chain, which his mother got me, actually.

And I do this thing for his mom where I pretend to cut myself, but I retract the blade, but I-l don't do it with him.

-That's fine.

-Are you okay?

Yeah, I must not have retracted the blade all the way.

- Do you need —

-Yeah.

Yeah, no, it's fine.

What else can I tell you?

-Um, I think I have enough.

-You have enough?

- Are you sure you're okay?

- Totally. I'm fine.

Well, I'll leave you guys for tonight.

Okay.

I'll be in touch if I have further questions.

Thanks.

Um...

Thanks. Um...

Thanks. Thank you for the water.

- Yeah, sure.

- Are you sure you're okay?

- Yeah.

- Okay.

- '- BYE-bye.

- Bye

Sorry.

All right, let...

I think you turn the...

-Okay

-Sorry

Okay.

Dad, are you okay?

Yeah, I'm just tired.

Dad, did she like us?

Yeah, she thought we were great.

Guys, slow down.

So... because Charlie dropped his claim to New York we're mostly done.

Jay's lost interest, and Ted, his associate, is doing the paperwork.

And we're not taking any money, right?

We withdrew our claim for the MacArthur, which I think we could have gotten, by the way, and they're not asking for any of the show.

Thank you for everything, Nora.

You're welcome, doll.

To your new home in LA.

And... whenever Charlie is in LA,

I got the custody breakdown to be 55/45.

So you'll have Henry an extra day every two weeks.

I thought we made it equal.

I tweaked it at the last minute.

I just didn't want him to be able to say he got 50/50, bragging to his friends.

- But I don't want to do that.

- Take it.

You won.

Hi. You look like a guy who really cares about animals.

Nope.

My God!

Hi.

The couch was technically hers, pre-marriage.

But I mean... it was our couch.

It's not like I was going to buy another couch.

But then when it comes time to split, it's suddenly her couch and I have no couch, and...

Hey, guys, what's UP?

I'm sitting on the floor is the short version.

I'm sorry.

This is all so self-pitying and boring.

No, come on.

No, it's so stupid. I'm sorry.

-It sounds really tough.

-No, no, no, no. it is sad.

Hello?

Hello?

-Hi. Sorry, the door was open.

-Shh.

Okay.

Whoa! Gotcha!

Aah!

Charlie!

Was your flight okay?

-Yeah.

-Carter.

Charlie.

Nicole's still at work.

Hi.

Can I get a hug?

- Hey, how'd it go?

- Hey.

Good, yeah. Denny's dead now. We shot the scene where he merges with the ficus.

- Henry's upstairs.

- She got an Emmy nomination.

-She's a great actress.

-No, for directing.

- Congratulations.

- Thanks.

Now I know what you were so obsessed with all the time.

-Um, we should get ready.

-Yeah.

- We're the Beatles.

- Come on, Charlie.

I didn't really get a costume together.

-You could be George Martin.

-I don't need to be anything.

-You've got to be something.

-A ghost. I'll get you a sheet.

I have the album cover if anyone needs to reference it.

And we should leave soon. I'm saying that as much for me as anyone else.

- Am I John or George?

- Trick-or-treating starts at 5:00.

You're George. Nicole is John.

I wanted to tell you

I took a residency at UCLA.

I'm going to direct two plays in rep at REDCAT.

So, I'm going to be here for a while.

That's great.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

It's only good.

Nicole?

Can you help me with my zipper?

"Charlie is... in...

Cl'...

...something.

"...neat and I re-ly on him to keep things in or-der.

He is energy con..."

-I don't know what this word is.

-You're getting so good at reading.

What is that?

"He doesn't look in the mirror too of-ten.

He cries eas-ily in movies...

He is very self-suf —"

Self-sufficient.

“He can Gar-n a sock...“

That means sew, like a hole.

"...and cook himself dinner and ir...

Break it into two parts.

"...Ur. On."

Not "ur" but "ire."

Ire. On.

Iron.

"...a shirt.

He rarely gets def-eated, which I fell... feel like I always do.

Charlie takes all of my moods stead-ily.

He doesn't give in to them or make me feel bad about them.

He's a great dress-er and never looks em..."

-I don't know this one.

-Embarrassing.

"...embarrassing, wh-ich is hard for a man."

You read it now.

"He's very competitive.

He loves being a dad.

He loves all the things you're supposed to hate, like the tantrums, the waking up at night.

It's almost annoying how much he likes it, but then, it's mostly nice.

He disappears into his own world.

He and Henry are alike that way.

He can tell... people they have food in their teeth or on their face in a way that doesn't make them feel bad.

Charlie is self-made.

His parents, I only met them once, but he told me there was a lot of alcohol...

He moved to New York from Indiana with no safety net, and now he's more New Yorker than any New Yorker.

He's brilliant at creating family out of whoever is around.

With the theater company... he casts a spell... that made everyone feel included.

No one, not even an intern, was unimportant."

What's an intern?

It's like a... helper, but who isn't paid.

Why aren't they paid?

They're young, they're learning.

I don't know, maybe if they do a good job, they get paid later.

Okay, keep going.

"He could remember all the inside jokes, he's extremely organized and thorough, he's very clear about what he wants, unlike me who can't always tell.

I fell in love with him two seconds after I saw him.

And I'll never stop loving him, even though it doesn't make sense anymore."

-See you. Good seeing you.

-Good seeing you too.

- Charlie!

- G-ma.

I'm so happy you came.

I'll e-mail you that article.

-Yes, please do.

-Yeah.

- All right. Thank you.

- Take care.

We were going to bring him to dinner, but he's so wiped out.

You want to take him?

-It's your night.

-I know.

-Yeah. I'll drop him back in the morning.

-Good.

Yeah, text me when you're up.

We'll figure something out.

You're going to go with your dad, okay?

- Okay.

- Yeah?

I love you.

I love you too.

Hey.

Thanks.





# Paterson

Mm. Mm.

Mm.

I had a beautiful dream.

We had two little children.

Twins.

If we have children, would you like it if they were twins?

Mmm. Mm-hm.

Yeah.

Twins.

Sure, why not?

One for each of us.

Mm.

We have plenty of matches in our house.

We keep them on hand always.

We have plenty of matches in our house.

- Morning.

- Morning.

Hey, man.

We have...

plenty...

of matches

in our house.

We keep them...

on hand always.

Currently, our favourite brand

is... Ohio Blue Tip.

Though we used to... prefer

Diamond brand.

Morning, Donny.

Ready to roll, Paterson?

Yeah.

Yeah, but you gotta know more, tell me.

Well, Hurricane Carter, he was a famous boxer.

And he lived right back there.

Paterson, baby.

He looked just like

Denzel Washington, too.

They locked him up.

Why'd they lock him up?

They say he shot some people up with a shotgun in a bar and all that.

I know he didn't do it.

Then they finally let him out, right?

Yo, years later, though. But yeah.

You think before all that,

Hurricane Carter ever shot somebody?

I don't know.

What are you gonna be for Halloween?

My mom found this picture on Instagram of these kids, they were shadows.

So they crept up next to kids, other kids, and they used to spook 'em out and look like shadows.

One year, I was actually a subway surfer.

You can buy that one?

Um, no, I built it.

Love Poem.

We have plenty of matches in our house.

We keep them on hand always.

Currently, our favourite brand

is Ohio Blue Tip.

Though we used to prefer

Diamond brand.

That was before...

we discovered

Ohio Blue Tip matches.

They are...

excellently... packaged

sturdy... little...

boxes...

with dark and light blue

and white labels

with words lettered in the shape

of a megaphone,

as if to say

even louder to the world,

"Here is the most...

"beautiful...

"match in the world,

"its one and half inch

"soft pine stem

"capped by a grainy

"dark purple head,

"so sober and furious

"and stubbornly ready

"to burst into flame,

"lighting, perhaps, the cigarette

"of the woman you love

"for the first time."

Because of the bake sale this weekend, I thought that if my cupcakes sell really well, it might be kind of a sign.

Sign of what, honey?

My dream!

To have my own cupcake business, of course.

Oh, that'd be nice.

- Thank you for dinner.

- You're welcome.

I made these myself. What do you think?

Oooh, yeah. That's really good.

I painted them.

I like how all the circles are different.

Was your sandwich for lunch OK?

Yeah, it was a really great sandwich.

Good. I'm glad.

Did you get a little writing done?

I did, yeah.

You know, darling,

I really think you should do something about those beautiful poems.

They should belong to the world, you know?

The world?

Well, now you're trying to scare me.

I am not! I'm serious, you big dumbbell.

Do you think having such wonderful feet helps you as a bus driver?

Driving that huge machine?

Mmm, yeah, maybe.

Does somebody need Daddy to take them for their nice little nightly walk?

- Just remember.

- What?

Cupcakes. We could be rich from cupcakes.

Really?

I'm ready for that.

Stop.

Oh, come on, Marvin.

Stay.

Sit!

Stay.

Thank you.

Hey, Paterson. Right on time.

Hey, Doc.

Look what the dog dragged in.

- How you doin', Paterson?

- Sam. Good to see you.

Good to see you.

I don't think you ever met my brother before.

He lives in Philly.

- This is my brother, Dave.

- Oh, wow.

- Uh, nice to meet you.

- You too. You too.

So, uh, Sam and Dave...

Our folks are big soul music fanatics, so that's, that's their story.

Oh, I see.

And you know that Dave Prater from the original "Sam and Dave" used to live right here in Paterson.

- Oh, yeah, I know.

- Got him right here, baby.

On the wall of fame.

- Well, it was nice to meet you.

- You too. You too.

Well, Paterson, my friend, how's life doin' you?

Uh, it's... you know, no complaints. You?

You know. Same old, same old...

Yeah.

Yo, Doc, the Rutgers game is on.

You're never gonna get a damn TV in here?

Hell, no!

OK, OK, I'm just asking.

I'm getting my ass kicked today.

Who you playing?

Myself.

Mm. Mm.

Mm.

Cold.

You look beautiful.

I was dreaming that we were in ancient Persia.

And you were riding on an elephant.

A big, silver elephant.

- A silver elephant?

- Yeah.

You looked so beautiful.

Did they have elephants in ancient Persia?

I don't think so.

Not silver ones, anyway.

Mm.

"Here's the most beautiful match in the world,

"so sober and furious and stubbornly ready

"to burst into flame,

"lighting, perhaps, the cigarette of the woman you love

"for the first time, and it was never really

"the same after that.

"All this will we give you."

That is what you gave me.

I become the cigarette

and you the match or...

I the match and you the cigarette,

blazing with kisses...

that smoulder toward heaven.

Morning, Donny.

- Ready to roll, Paterson?

- Yeah.

Everything OK?

Well, now that you ask, no, not really.

My kid needs braces on her teeth.

My car needs a transmission job.

My wife wants me to take her to Florida.

But I'm behind on the mortgage payments.

My uncle called from India and he needs money for my niece's wedding, and I got this strange rash on my back - you name it, brother.

- How 'bout you?

- I'm OK.

- OK, well, have a nice day.

- OK, you too.

Yeah. I doubt it.

You know the... that cute little brunette from the, uh, from the doughnut place?

Yeah, yeah. She's pretty hot.

Yeah. Turns out she lives in my neighbourhood.

Yeah. The other day,

I come home from work.

I'm, you know, tired,

I'm having a beer, all right?

I hear a knock at the door.

- I open it and it's her!

- Really? Oh, man!

She is all made up, looking, like, really good.

So what happened?

Well, we just talked there at the door for like a while, you know, and she was, like, laughing a lot.

She was, you know, making eye contact, you know...

- I... She wanted to hang out.

- So then what?

Well, we just, you know, we had, like, a really nice conversation and then, you know,

I-I-I was really tired and everything.

I hadn't really showered or anything, so she left.

She left?

Yeah, but you know...

I mean, I know what she wanted. Right?

Yeah. Yeah, for-for sure, Jimmy.

These females are outta control.

- Right.

- You know?

Yeah, yeah.

They're out of control.

Yeah. Well, I-I had a similar thing happen last week, man.

- Oh yeah?

- Yeah, check this out.

I'm at Larry's barbecue party on Sunday, right?

- Larry had a barbecue?

- Yeah, the barbecue party.

And, uh, I'm just standing out there on the deck, right?

And I'd already eaten a lot, and I'm just having a beer, right?

And you know that blonde friend of Larry's girlfriend, um, Rita?

- I'm not sure you met her.

- I don't know Rita.

Well, she is, like, super hot!

Right?

- Oh, yeah.

- And just like, stacked too.

Just beautiful curves.

Like an animal.

And, you know, she comes over to me and she asks me what I'm doing later!

- All right.

- Yeah, right?

Yeah, so we talk for a little while.

And, uh, she was like, really flirtatious too, man.

- OK.

- You know. Yeah.

And finished my beer, and, oh, man, you know,

I had to get up early for work the next morning and all that, so...

- You split?

- Yeah.

Yeah.

But it was... it was cool, though.

Uh, I mean, I knew exactly what she wanted, right.

And I got her number, too.

She gave me her number.

So did you call her?

No, not yet. No. Mm-mm.

No, cos I figured

I'd wait a couple of days.

- All right.

- You know.

- OK.

- But I should call her, though.

- Yeah.

- I should.

You, uh, you workin' late tonight?

Yeah.

- Yeah, I need the overtime.

- Yeah, me too.

Another One.

When you're a child,

you learn there are three dimensions -

height, width and depth.

Like a shoebox.

Then later, you hear

there's a fourth dimension -

time.

Hmm.

Then some say

there can be five...

six, seven...

Are you OK down here, honey?

Uh, yeah.

Yeah, I'm finished for now.

Now, darling... you have two important things to talk about before you and Marvin go out for your walk.

Oh, OK. Two important things.

One's about you and one is about me.

OK.

One is about your writing, and you know what it is.

Oh.

Please. Please make some copies.

You know that I know that your poetry is really, really good.

And that some day, you might just decide to let the world get to read it.

- Laura, I really don't...

- No.

Look me in the eye for a second.

Look me in the eye.

You are a great poet.

All your poems are still in that one notebook.

Your secret notebook.

My secret notebook, yeah.

So will you finally just go to the Xerox place or something?

Please. Just do it.

It would take about ten minutes to make a copy of your entire secret notebook.

Well, I think it'd take a little longer than ten minutes.

OK. OK. 15 or 20 minutes.

I would even do it for you.

Baby, I've been asking for a year, at least.

Yeah, you have.

Well, maybe I can do it this weekend.

You promise?

Y-Yeah, OK.

Thank you. I'll feel so much better.

What was the...

What was the thing about you?

Well, it's not as important as that, but...

I've been thinkin' about music lately, and, and then I saw this guitar on YouTube that Esteban demonstrates.

And it's in black and white.

It's called the Harlequin.

And it's so fantastic that

I think I really need to learn to play the guitar.

And it comes with... comes with lessons and DVDs and instructions, so in no time at all,

I could be playing away and realising my dream.

I-I... Which dream is this?

Don't be silly. To be a country singer.

Maybe even a big star, like one of the greats like Tammy Wynette or... or Patsy Cline.

And I can wear black and white and have my own distinctive style.

I have a very strong visual style, as you know.

Yes, you... Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

Yeah, definitely.

Well, y-you really need this guitar?

Oh, yes. And they say it's so important to learn new things as you get older.

And, well, music, you just don't know where it could lead.

And it's only a few hundred dollars.

I know it's expensive, but we can pay a little each month and free two-day shipping.

A few hundred dollars?

It comes with lessons, instruction books, a tuner and, um, extra strings and a hard case and everything.

Well, I think, um, maybe...

Maybe you could be, uh, a country singer some day.

- Really?

- Yeah.

I wouldn't put it past you.

Oh, honey, thank you!

Thank you. I love you.

And I love you too, handsome.

Who's going out with Daddy?

Who is my good boy going out with Daddy?

Marvin's going out with Daddy.

Yes. Who is going out with Daddy?

Yes, good boy. Good boy.

Oh, look at that. Look at that right there.

That's cute, right?

That's an actual creature.

Hey, yo!

Yo, my man, let me holler at you for a minute!

Hey, yo, that's a English bulldog, right?

Uh, yeah.

Yo, I told you, man.

Them dogs are poppin' right now.

Yo, that dog mad expensive, right?

Yeah, well... expensive to feed.

You hear this guy, yo?

Nah, I feel you, though, but, man, dogs like that get jacked, y'know what I mean?

Like, dog-jacked, my G. You feel me?

Oooh, hear that little guy, man?

Dog-jacked?

Well, it gives me something to look forward to, then, I guess.

All right, money.

Hey, yo, be safe out here, a'right?

And cuff that dog. It's real out here, bro.

All right.

I'm gonna cuff you, Marvin.

OK, Marvin. Don't get dog-jacked.

Paterson, I got something weird.

- Maybe for the wall. Maybe...

- What's this?

You know this cat? Iggy Pop?

Oh, yeah, Iggy and the Stooges.

"Paterson, New Jersey

Teenage Girls' Club

"names singer Iggy Pop world's sexiest man."

- "June, 1970."

- Does it go up?

Uh, yeah. Sure, why not? It's Paterson.

All right.

All right. Iggy Pop on the wall.

- Iggy.

- Hey, Doc?

Who's that, who's that, right next to Uncle Floyd holding the guitar?

I finally got you. Well, that's new.

But that's Uncle Floyd Vivino's little brother Jimmy.

He's a band leader on the Conan O'Brien show.

That's a little past my bedtime.

Hey, Marie. Another ginger ale?

- Thanks, Doc.

- You know Paterson, right?

Umm, not really, but... we've seen each other.

- Hey, Paterson.

- Hey-hey-hey, Marie.

- You drive the bus, right?

- Yeah, I do.

Your name really Paterson, or they just nickname you that?

Uh, no, my real name is Paterson.

Well, that's kind of crazy, right?

Yeah. Right.

Oh, shit.

Everett still not gettin' it.

Not yet, the numbskull.

I've been breaking up with him for two weeks now.

What am I gonna do?

Marie, baby, I need to talk to you.

- No!

- Please.

Just talk to me for a few minutes.

No, Everett. We've talked enough.

- More than enough.

- Please.

- Hey, Paterson.

- Hey, Everett.

Thanks, Doc.

Man, what would you do?

You love somebody... more than anything in the whole damn world.

You... worship her.

You don't wanna be alive without her and... she says she doesn't want you.

You're just... dirt.

Damn, brother. You should be an actor.

I am an actor.

Oh, yeah, that's... that's real funny.

A man dying of heartbreak.

That... that's hilarious.

No. We are sympathetic.

Have another drink, Everett, on the house.

Thanks.

Good morning.

- You up?

- Uh-uh.

Another One.

When you're a child,

you learn there are three dimensions -

height, width, and depth.

Then, later, you hear there's a fourth dimension -

time.

Hmm...

Then some say there can be five, six, seven...

I knock off work,

have a beer at the bar.

I look down at the glass and feel glad.

All right, watch out, watch out, watch out...

Poem.

I'm in the house.

It's nice out.

Warm.

Sun on cold snow.

First day of spring

or last of winter.

My legs run up the stairs

and out the door,

my top half here writing.

- Hello, darling!

- Hello, honey.

- I'm painting!

- Hello, Marvin.

I see that.

What do you think?

Doesn't it make everything more interesting?

- Yeah, it's very interesting.

- How was your day?

Eh, the usual.

Get any writing done?

I did, a little, yeah.

I'm working on a poem for you.

A love poem?

Yeah, I guess if it's for you, it's a love poem.

It's kind of inspired by our, uh, Ohio Blue Tip Matches.

Really?

Does it mention the little megaphone shape the letters make?

Y-Yeah. Actually, it does.

How beautiful.

I can't wait to read it when it's done.

I also painted new shower curtains.

You should see them.

Oh, OK.

You know what else I did today?

You, uh, planted an unusual vegetable garden in the back yard?

No, silly! That you have to do in the spring.

- Oh.

- No, I ordered my present that's from you.

P-present that's from me? What?

The guitar! The Esteban Harlequin model.

- Oh.

- I'm so excited.

It comes in two days.

I didn't get to speak to Esteban on the phone, though.

Well, I'm sure he's really busy, honey.

Don't make fun of me.

Hey, look out, though, cos Nashville, here I come!

Look out, Nashville!

I'll get dinner ready!

We're having something new!

- What is it?

- Quinoa!

It's like a grain, sort of like couscous, but different.

I read that it came from the ancient Incas.

A-And it's really good for you.

Oh.

We're having quinoa, Marvin.

All right, sit.

...he comes back with a shotgun.

Now the bear comes over, taps him on the shoulder, knocks the shotgun out the way, and does the same thing.

So he's sittin' like this, look at this bear.

- He does not go back.

- Well, he goes back.

First, he goes out and gets a bazooka, puts the bazooka on his shoulder.

He walks out there, the bear comes up, taps him on the shoulders and says... you don't come here.

- Yeah.

He was born in Italy, but he lived here.

He was a weaver, an anarchist weaver.

This was in the 1890s.

And at that time in Italy, people were starving.

When they demonstrated, this Italian general had them fired upon with, like, muskets and cannons, which, of course, resulted in a bloody massacre with, like, a hundred people dead.

Was Gaetano Bresci there?

No, he was here in Paterson.

But when he heard that the King of Italy,

King Umberto the First, decorated this fucking general for bravely defending his royal house,

Gaetano Bresci went over to Italy somehow and he shot Umberto the First four times with a revolver.

Whoa. Did they kill Bresci?

No, they captured him and they put him on trial with, like, a famous anarchist lawyer and everything.

But since there was no capital punishment in Italy at that time, like 1900,

I mean... nor is there now.

You can't be a member of the European Union if you practise capital punishment, of course.

- Yeah, not like here.

- Yeah.

Anyway, they sent Gaetano Bresci to, like, this prison island where they put all the other anarchists, and after, like, a year, he was found dead in his prison cell.

Murdered?

Well, yeah, most likely by the guards.

But, there's a possibility that he committed suicide.

Whoa, Gaetano Bresci.

Do you think there are any other anarchists still around in Paterson?

You mean besides us? Not likely.

Hey, what time is your first class?

It's at 10:00.

- Wanna grab a coffee?

- Sure.

Glow.

When I wake up

earlier than you,

and you are turned

to face me,

face on the pillow

and hair spread around,

I take a chance and stare at you,

amazed in love and afraid

that you might open your eyes

and have the daylights scared out of you.

But maybe with the daylights gone,

you'd see how much

my chest and head

implode for you, their voices

trapped inside like unborn children

fearing they will never see

the light of day.

The opening in the wall

now dimly glows, it's rainy, blue and grey.

I tie my shoes and go downstairs

to put the coffee on.

It's all warmed up for you, Donny.

All used up's more like it.

You OK?

Well, since you asked, no, not really.

My mother-in-law is moving in.

The cat got diagnosed with cat diabetes.

And the medicine, you know, it's all so expensive.

And now, my daughter started taking violin lessons and I'm losing my mind with the sound of that.

What can I say, Paterson?

- Oh, sorry.

- Oh, just my burden, I guess.

- My particular burden.

- OK.

I'll see you tomorrow.

Excuse me. Are you OK here, all alone?

I'm fine. I'm just waiting for my mom and my sister.

She's upstairs, in that building over there.

Do you mind if I sit down till your mom comes down?

Sure.

- Yeah?

- Yeah.

- Are you a bus driver?

- Yeah.

Do you ever drive one of those accordion buses?

Articulated.

Accordion.

No, I just drive the regular ones.

Did you ever drive a fire truck?

No, just, uh, buses and cars, and, uh, I drove a big truck a few times, but, uh, that's it.

Are you, uh, interested in poetry?

- Uh, actually, I am, kind of.

- Really?

- Yeah.

- I write poetry.

I keep it all in this notebook.

Secret notebook.

- Oh, you're a poet.

- Yeah.

That's great.

- Would you like to hear one?

- Sure, sure.

It doesn't really rhyme, though.

That's OK. I kind of like them better when they don't.

Yeah, me too.

OK. This one's called "Water Falls".

Two words, though, like that.

"Water Falls", OK.

OK.

"Water Falls".

"Water falls from the bright air.

"It falls like hair,

"falling across a young girl's shoulders.

"Water falls,

"making pools in the asphalt,

"dirty mirrors with clouds and buildings inside.

"It falls on the roof of my house.

"It falls on my mother, and on my hair.

"Most people call it rain."

That's a beautiful poem.

- You really liked it?

- Yeah, I really do.

I think it's beautiful.

"Water Falls". Thank you.

It doesn't rhyme exactly.

No, but the first two lines do, in a nice way.

And some nice little internal rhymes too, I think.

Internal rhymes.

Oh, my mom's done.

That's my sister. We're twins.

It was nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you too. Nice to meet a... nice to meet a real poet.

Do you like Emily Dickinson?

I do, yeah. She's one of my favourites.

Awesome, a bus driver that likes Emily Dickinson.

"Water falls from the bright air,

"falls like hair,

"falling across a young girl's shoulder."

I'm so excited to see what you'll think.

Some fresh basil.

I grew it myself on the windowsill.

W-we're having pie for dinner?

Yeah, but a dinner pie.

Oh.

What do you think's inside?

Uh, inside the secret pie?

Uh, I don't know. Fish?

No, not fish, silly!

- Want me to tell you?

- Uhh, yes, please.

OK.

Cheddar cheese and Brussels sprouts.

- Seriously?

- Yeah, baked into a pie.

Doesn't it sound delicious?

You love Brussels sprouts and you love Cheddar cheese.

I do, yeah.

No, that sounds very original.

Is it a new recipe you found?

No, I made it up.

Secret pie.

I made a small one for Marvin.

He really seemed to like it.

Mm-hm, secret pie.

Honey, I'm glad you like it.

Speaking of secret pie,

I wanted to tell you something about your secret notebook.

- What?

- Did you ever hear of the old Italian poet called Pet-ra-rch, is that it?

Mm, Petrarch. He perfected the sonnet.

Um, I read online that one of his early books of poems

was called The Secret Book.

Just like yours.

I didn't know that.

You read that?

You just happened upon it online?

And also that he wrote all his love poems to a beautiful girl called, ta-dah, Laura.

That's true.

So you have many things in common with other great and famous poets, you see.

Do you like it there?

It's the waterfalls, your favourite place.

I'm not sure.

Yeah, it's nice there.

So remember, you promised to finally make copies of your poems this weekend.

I will, as soon as I have some free time.

You promised me. This weekend.

I will, no, I-I promised.

So why don't you recite me something?

Just a few little lines, maybe from the love poem.

Well I-I can give you a few lines I didn't write.

Are they by your hero,

Carlo William Carlos?

William Carlos Williams.

I know, darling. I was teasing.

No, it's a poem by a... by a girl I met.

A girl you met?

Yeah, no, like a little girl.

Like a t... like a ten-year-old girl.

Oh!

She was on the bus?

No, I met her on my way home from work, near the old factories.

She was waiting for her mom and her sister and... and I noticed she had a notebook of poems, and she read one to me.

From her own secret notebook?

Yeah, exactly.

The picture of the falls made me think of it.

I just remember how it started.

"Water falls from the bright air,

"falls like hair,

"falling across a young girl's shoulders."

Nice.

Almost like one of yours.

Did she have long hair?

Uh, she did, yeah.

Hmm.

Laura, what's all that flour and stuff for?

For my cupcakes, remember?

Saturday is my turn on the baking booth in the farmer's market.

I remembered this morning that, oh, my God, it's the day after tomorrow.

I have so many cupcakes to make. Oh, my!

- You don't like your pie?

- No, I do, yeah!

Our own Romeo and Juliet.

Or, maybe, more like

Antony and Cleopatra?

Speaking of Romeo and Juliet,

Abbott and Costello.

Look, Lou Costello has got to be the most famous person from Paterson.

Yeah, probably, yeah. I mean, he... he's got that statue and he's got his own park.

Right, I mean,

Alexander Hamilton has a statue, others got statues but not their own park!

Hell, even Fetty Wap don't have no park.

Yeah, Lou Costello.

I wonder where Bud Abbott was born?

Uhh, that I know.

Jersey, also.

Asbury Park. Uh, 1895, maybe.

- You knew that?

- Oh, hell, yeah, man.

I know a lot of shit about a lot of shit.

And Lou Costello.

- "Who's on first?"

- Uh, who's on first, what's on second,

- I don't know's on third...

- Wait, who's on first?

Who's on first?

I'll tell ya who's on first.

And I'll tell ya what's on second too.

But you ain't gonna wanna know.

I can explain, sweetheart.

No, let me explain.

That is my cookie jar money.

That is money I've been saving up so I could get my hair fixed to go to your damn niece's wedding.

That is my money. Mine!

I promise, I will replace it.

I-I will replace it after this weekend's chess tournament.

Chess tournament?

Doc, you gonna need a chess tourniquet if you don't put that damn money back.

You OK, Doc?

Paterson, you still don't got a cell phone?

Uh, no... no, I don't want one.

It would be a leash.

What about the better half? She got one?

She's got one, yeah.

And a laptop. And an iPad.

She doesn't want you to get one?

No, no, she's OK about it.

She understands me really well.

Lucky guy.

You don't listen to me at all!

The friendship can be folded into something greater.

I don't want to fold it into something greater!

Hey, Doc, what d... what does Abbott and Costello have to do with, uh, Romeo and Juliet?

- Wait, wait, wait, please.

- Everett!

I would rather drop dead.

Is there anything we can do?

Nah, I always say, don't try to change things, or you'll make them even worse.

- Good morning!

- Morning.

You're up late, honey.

Your silent, magic watch didn't wake you up.

Yeah, it was a little late today.

Well, some days, something inside just doesn't wanna get up.

Ever feel like that?

Today.

Oh, my. I have so much to do.

I know it's silly, but I'm so excited about the new farmer's market.

Because if my cupcakes are a big sensation, then I might be on my way to a very successful business.

That would be amazing, honey.

And you know what else?

My guitar should arrive today.

My Harlequin guitar, direct from Esteban.

Is Esteban gonna deliver it personally?

Who knows?

Mmm, smells good.

I like your technique.

The Run.

I go through

trillions of molecules

that move aside

to make way for me,

while on both sides,

trillions more

stay where they are.

The windshield wiper blade

starts to squeak.

The rain has stopped.

I stop.

Morning, Donny.

You OK?

No, not really.

You don't even wanna know.

I go through trillions of molecules

that move aside

to make way for me,

while on both sides,

trillions more

stay where they are.

The windshield wiper blade starts to squeak.

The rain has stopped.

I stop.

On the corner,

a boy in a yellow raincoat

holding his mother's hand.

I think it's probably best if we, uh, stand as far away from the bus as we can.

It's not gonna catch on fire or anything, is it?

It could explode into a fireball!

Oh, no, ma'am.

It's just an electrical problem.

What's gonna happen to us now?

Are we stranded here?

Oh, no, no, no.

Another bus will come get us shortly.

Dear God.

I think we'll just gather up over there, if you don't mind, thank you very much.

OK, people. Let's join the rest of the passengers, if we could.

- Did we run out of gas?

- No, plenty of gas.

It's just, uh, an electrical problem.

Sabotage, probably.

OK, let's... let's come over here.

Another bus will come get us in a minute.

OK everyone, I... I apologise again for this inconvenience.

I think it's best if we wait here for a few minutes and, uh, I'll call now for a replacement bus.

- Don't you have a smartphone?

- Uh, no I-I don't.

I don't, not with me.

Would you like to use my phone,

Mr Bus Driver?

Oh, if you don't mind. Thank you.

So, what's gonna happen to this bus?

Um, well, a... a big truck is gonna come and tow it back to the depot.

- Awesome.

- Thank you very much.

- I can't wait to see the truck.

- OK, I'll just be over here.

I apologise again.

Hi, this is Paterson, bus 23,

I have a situation.

Third, second and first.

Third, second, first.

Pluck all those strings together.

There you have your first chord.

Surprise!

Just sit down, darling, for a second, and listen to this.

OK.

♪ I've been working on the railroad

♪ All the livelong day

♪ I've been working on the railroad

♪ Just to pass the time away ♪

Well, that's as far as I got so far.

But it's pretty amazing, right?

For someone who never played before?

It's very amazing.

You just learned all that today?

Yeah, from these instructional DVDs.

And I've been baking all day too.

Well, I'm very impressed.

Isn't she beautiful?

Yeah, you two were made for each other.

What's it called again? The... the Jester?

- No, the Harlequin.

- Harlequin.

And thank you, my love.

You look a little drained.

You're home a little late.

Was your day OK?

Well, it was until the bus broke down.

The bus broke down? Was it dangerous?

No, it was just, uh, just sputtered out.

It was an electrical problem.

Electrical problem?

Could it have exploded into a fireball?

No, no.

It's just an old bus.

Well, I think they should get their best driver, who's also a great poet, a brand-new bus.

It's the least they could do.

The city of Paterson?

Not likely.

Well, honey. I'm just glad you're OK.

Maybe you should get a smartphone.

Just for emergencies.

You know I don't want one.

The world worked fine before they even existed.

I know, darling, but sometimes they make things easier.

Honey, since the kitchen's a mess with all my baking going on, couldn't we order out?

Like, a pizza?

- Pizza's fine with me.

- Great.

Then after dinner, while you and Marvin go out,

I could practise just a little more.

I wanna learn the rest of that song, at least.

The Harlequin.

So what'd they do?

Send a mechanic, uh, on site or tow the motherfucker or what?

Yeah, yeah.

They come and tow it back to the depot, and they send a replacement bus for the passengers.

Man, that could've been a lot worse.

Damn thing could've exploded into a fuckin' fireball!

Hey, Doc, if you're not doing anything tomorrow, they're having the new outdoor farmer's market again.

And I know for a fact there's gonna be some fantastic cupcakes for sale in the bakery booth.

Oh, tomorrow's, uh... tomorrow's Saturday.

I got that big chess tournament goin' on over there in Camden.

Oh, right, right.

OK, well, good luck.

Yeah, thanks.

Hey, fellas.

- Hey, Marie.

- Hey, shortie.

How you and, uh, Romeo doin'?

Please, Everett!

And we're not doing.

If anything, he's acting worse.

But I think the key word is acting.

Well, how well do you really know him?

We've known each other since we were kids.

And I really do care about him.

It's just... this whole girlfriend thing was a big mistake.

Obviously.

It's cool. He just needs to act out.

He's always been that way.

He needed some kind of drama, and then he gets over it.

He's not gonna do anything crazy, is he?

If you ask me, everything he does is crazy.

Speak of the devil.

Baby, I need to talk to you for a minute.

Everett, why can't you just forget about me?

- Because I am in love with you.

- Well, you can't have me.

OK.

OK.

OK, then nobody move!

If I can't have you, then I guess nobody can.

Everett.

Stop acting crazy.

Crazy? You wanna see crazy?

I'll show y'all crazy!

Smooth move, Paterson.

You damn chucklehead.

Comin' in here. Clearin' out my place.

I oughta kick your black ass.

Without love, what reason is there for anything?

Thanks, Paterson.

That was very heroic.

Yeah, wow. OK.

I don't know.

If it wasn't for you, crazy motherfucker might have shot himself to death with a piece of foam.

Good morning.

What time is it?

- It's Saturday morning, baby.

- Oh.

You were out a little late last night.

Yeah.

There was, umm... an incident at the... at the bar.

Incident at the bar? What happened?

Well...

- Oh, a guy had a gun.

- What?

Well, he had what I thought was a real gun.

And he threatened this girl and...

Oh my God! He threatened a girl?

He threatened to shoot himself.

All because he's in love with her.

It's complicated. Anyway, I tried to stop him and I knocked the gun away and turns out it was a toy gun that shoots little foam pellets.

Sure looked real, though.

Oh, honey.

Oh, that's so frightening.

You acted so heroically.

I told you that place could be dangerous.

I mean, anyone could just walk in there any time with a shotgun or something.

Now you see what I mean?

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

But it was only... it was only a toy gun.

Why are you up already?

It's Saturday.

I have to get my cupcakes to the farmer's market.

- Remember?

- I do now.

I smell cupcakes.

Mmm, still smell a hint of beer.

Wow!

This looks fantastic, baby.

- Thank you.

- Thank you.

Who's sitting in Daddy's chair?

Who's sitting in Daddy's chair, huh?

William Carlos Williams?

Oh, no, uh, Carlo William Carlos.

Will you read me that one I love so much?

"This Is Just To Say"?

Comin' up.

"This is just to say

"I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox

"and which you were probably saving for breakfast.

"Forgive me.

"They were delicious,

"so sweet and so cold."

- Oh, I love that poem.

- Yeah, that's a good one.

And some of yours are just as good.

Well...

Now, remember your promise.

I promised.

I better get going.

Could you put the rest in the boxes?

Sure.

OK.

This is the last of 'em.

- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

- Oh, wow.

All together like this, they look great.

- I'm so excited.

- Good.

OK, they should be good, if you just drive slowly.

Yeah, yeah. I... I will.

You're not taking him with you?

Oh, honey, I can't.

Maybe you could take him for a walk later, huh?

Love you.

Yeah, love you.

All right. Come on, Marvin.

Come on, Marvin.

Can't we stop here for a second?

Pumpkin

My little pumpkin,

I like to think about other girls sometimes,

but

the truth is

if you ever left me,

I'd tear my heart out

and never put it back.

There'll never be anyone like you.

How embarrassing.

- Honey?

- Down here.

- How'd it go?

- Oh, honey, I'm so happy!

You won't believe this, but I made $286.

Wow.

My cupcakes were a huge hit.

Everyone's talking about them.

That's fantastic.

Marvin!

$286 cash money, baby.

Wow!

I know it's no big deal.

It's just silly cupcakes.

But I'm quite proud of myself.

Oh, yeah, you should be.

Can we celebrate?

Uh, yeah, sure. What should we do?

- First of all, I'm gonna treat.

- OK.

I'd like to go to dinner and then go to the movies.

We haven't gone to the movies in so long.

Uh, yeah, no... no we haven't.

What should we see?

You know that one theatre at the mall now shows old scary movies on Saturday nights?

We could see an old scary movie.

I'm gonna get changed and get ready.

I'm very proud of you.

And you, my little man.

You're gonna have to stay here and guard the palace.

Honey, should I change my shirt?

That'd be nice.

This is so much fun.

It's like, you're living in the 20th century.

This is Mr Parker, Lota.

How do you do? Don't be afraid.

How do you do?

Mr Parker has come to us from over the sea.

She's a pure Polynesian.

The only woman on the entire island.

Well, uh, I'll leave you two young people together.

I've got work to do.

Won't you sit down?

You come from the sea?

Well, around it.

Three days on an upturned lifeboat.

- You go away?

- Tomorrow morning.

I wish you would not go away.

Oh, that's very nice of you, but I must.

You'll come back? Again?

Well I-I don't know.

How does it happen that you're the only woman on this island?

Did, uh, Dr Moreau bring you here?

Pardon me if I seem to be too inquisitive.

Quickly, please!

Get out!

They're vivisecting a human being.

They're cutting a living man to pieces.

Now I know about his natives.

They're his victims.

I did love it that it was in black and white.

Yeah, yeah, I haven't...

I haven't seen a black-and-white movie in a long time.

My favourite part was when the lead guy kissed the wild panther girl.

You look... you look like her.

You do. You guys could be twins.

Well, thank you for treating me to dinner and a movie.

I'm happy I could.

- We should do it every weekend.

- Yeah.

Now that you're the cupcake queen of Paterson.

Cupcake queen of Paterson.

I love it.

Thank you.

What is this?

Marvin?

Marvin, did you do this?

Oh, my God!

It's...

It's your notebook.

It's what?

Your poems.

Honey, I'm so sorry.

I don't know what to even say.

You... you usually keep your notebook down at the basement.

I guess I left it up here on the sofa.

That stupid dog.

He's gotta be put out in the garage.

Honey, it's so early.

It's Sunday.

Please, come back to sleep.

Please, baby.

I will, I will, baby.

Ye... Go back to sleep.

I don't like you, Marvin.

Marvin, didn't I put you in the garage?

No, it's OK,

I let him back in when I went outside.

No, he's going back out there!

Come on, Marvin!

No! You're staying out there!

I wish you would have read me some of your most recent poems.

Maybe I could've remembered them.

It's OK.

They were just words... written on water.

Baby, I'm so sorry.

I saved all the pieces.

Maybe, somehow, they could be puzzled back together, with a computer programme, or something.

Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?

Should I play you the song

I've been learning on my guitar?

Oh, no, that's OK.

Th... I appreciate the offer, just, maybe, not right now.

OK?

Maybe you just wanna be left alone?

Should I go out for a while?

Oh, n-n-no, no. No, it's OK.

Maybe I'll go out.

Take a little walk.

Paterson. It's you.

Hello, Everett.

I'm sorry about the other night.

I kinda lost myself.

Yeah.

It's OK. Are you doing better now?

Yeah, I guess so.

You OK?

You look a little low yourself.

Yeah, yeah.

I'm OK.

Well, it's like they always say.

"The sun still rises every mornin' and sets every evenin'."

- Always another day, right?

- Yeah.

So far.

So far, yeah.

So, I guess I'll see you around, then.

- Yeah, yeah, take care.

- Yeah, you too.

Excuse me, please.

Allow to sit?

Uh, yeah.

- Yeah, sure.

- Thank you.

Excuse me.

Maybe not acceptable behaviour, but may I ask if you from here, in Paterson, New Jersey?

Am I?

Uh, yeah.

Yes I am. I was born here.

Excuse me again.

But, are you knowing the great poet, William Carlos Williams?

Here in Paterson, New Jersey?

Well, I'm aware of his poems.

Excellent.

May I ask if you too are a poet of Paterson, New Jersey?

Uh, no.

No.

I see.

I'm a bus driver, myself.

Just a bus driver.

A bus driver in Paterson.

Ah.

This very poetic.

Well, I'm not so sure 'bout that.

Yes. This could be poem by William Carlos Williams.

Did you know interesting

French artist Jean Dubuffet was meteorologist on top of Eiffel Tower, Paris, in 1922?

- Very poetic.

- Yeah.

Yeah, Jean Dubuffet.

Yeah, he was, uh, he was a meteorologist.

This I learn from poem by your interesting poet,

Frank O'Hara of New York City.

Yeah, I read that, too.

I like Frank O'Hara.

The... the New York School.

Ah ha.

I guess you really like poetry, then?

I breathe poetry.

So, you write poetry?

Yes.

My notebooks.

Ah, yeah.

My poetry only in Japanese.

No translation.

Poetry in translation is like taking a shower with a raincoat on.

I see what you mean.

I hope this isn't, um, inappropriate behaviour, but may I ask what you're doing here in Paterson?

I come here to see city of your interesting poet,

William Carlos Williams, who lived and make his poems here in Paterson, New Jersey.

- As you know.

- Yeah, yeah. He lived here.

He was a doctor.

Ah ha.

"Ah ha," what?

Also Allen Ginsberg is growing up here.

Also Paterson, New Jersey.

Yeah, that's true.

I leave here tomorrow.

Nice to meet you.

Oh, nice to meet you. Are you... you're going back to Tokyo?

No, Osaka.

Oh, Osaka. What I meant.

Have a good trip.

Thank you.

- I'm sorry.

- Oh.

A gift.

A gift?

Yes.

Sometime empty page present most possibilities.

Thank you. That's very kind of you.

Excuse me!

Ah ha!

Ah ha.

The Line

There's an old song

my grandfather used to sing

that has the question,

"Or would you rather be a fish?"

In the same song

is the same question

but with a mule and a pig,

but the one I hear sometimes

in my head

is the fish one.

Just that one line.

Would you rather be a fish?

As if the rest of the song

didn't have to be there.





# Phantom Thread

Reynolds has made my dreams come true.

And I have given him what he desires most in return.

And what's that?

Every piece of me.

He's a very demanding man, isn't he?

Must be quite a challenge to be with him.

Yes.

Maybe he's the most demanding man.

Morning, ladies.

- Morning.

- Morning, madam.

Good morning, ladies.

- Morning, Biddy.

- Morning, Mr Woodcock.

- Morning, Nana.

- Morning, Mr Woodcock.

- Pippa.

- Morning, sir.

Try these.

Reynolds. They're delicious.

Remember I told you, Johanna...

No more stodgy things?

I didn't know that.

You may have told it to someone else.

- Morning.

- Morning, my old so-and-so.

Where have you gone, Reynolds?

There's nothing I can say to get your attention aimed back at me.

Is there?

I cannot begin my day with a confrontation, please.

I'm delivering the dress today.

And I can't take up space with a confrontation.

I simply don't have time for confrontations.

Good morning, Countess.

Good morning, Cyril.

Good morning, Peter.

Who is this beautiful stranger?

I need to see you far more often, Henrietta.

- I am very excited.

- I am, too. Come in.

Exquisite.

Yes?

Let's take it for a walk.

Beautiful work, ladies.

- Thank you very much.

- Thank you.

It's beautiful, Reynolds.

Worth everything we've been through.

I feel like it will give me courage.

Ladies and gentlemen, take your seats, please.

- Evening, Stephen. Is she here?

- Yes, sir.

What do you want to do about Johanna?

I mean, she's lovely, but the time has come.

And she's getting fat, sitting around waiting for you to fall in love with her again.

I'll give her the October dress.

If that's all right.

I have an unsettled feeling, based on nothing I can put my finger on.

Just butterflies.

Been having the strongest memories of Mama lately, coming to me in my dreams, smelling her scent.

The strongest sense that she's near us.

Reaching out towards us.

I very much hope that she saw the dress tonight. Don't you?

Yes.

It's comforting to think the dead are watching over the living.

I don't find that spooky at all.

Why don't you go to the country tonight?

I'll follow tomorrow.

Good idea.

I like that idea very much.

My old so-and-so.

Mr Hansford?

- Mr Hansford?

- Hello?

- Good morning.

- Morning.

- Fill it up, please.

- I will do.

Check the oil and the tires. Lovely. Thank you.

It's a hard frost this morning.

It's cold, isn't it?

It's very bitter.

Excuse me. Could we have a bit more toast, please?

Yes.

- Here you are.

- Thank you.

- Good morning.

- Morning.

What would you like to order?

A Welsh rarebit...

With a poached egg on top, please.

Not too runny.

And bacon, scones, butter, cream, jam, not strawberry.

No.

Raspberry?

What else?

Coffee or tea?

Do you have Lapsang?

I'll have a pot of

Lapsang, please.

Good choice.

And some sausages.

And some sausages.

Show me.

Will you remember?

Yes.

I'm keeping this.

And now?

Will you have dinner with me?

Yes.

For the hungry boy, my name is Alma.

- Am I late?

- No.

What do you think?

I like the sauce.

Custard.

It's quite good.

May I, Alma?

I like to see who I'm talking to.

Here.

There you are. That's better.

Does your mother have brown eyes?

Green.

Do you look very much like her?

I don't know, I think so.

Do you have a photograph?

Yes.

- Would you let me see it?

- Not here, at home.

Carry it with you.

Always carry her with you.

Where's yours?

Your mother.

She's here in the canvas.

What do you mean?

You can sew almost anything into the canvas of a coat.

Secrets, coins, words, little messages.

When I was a boy, I started to hide things in the linings of the garments, things that only I knew were there.

And over my breast, I have a lock of my mother's hair, to keep her close to me always.

She was quite a remarkable woman.

She taught me my trade.

So I try to never be without her.

You must love her very much.

Hello.

This is Alma. Say hello to Alma.

Hello.

This is Alma. Come say hello to Alma.

- Come on, come on.

- Hello.

Shall we show her the house, lads?

I made this dress for her when I was 16 years old.

It's beautiful.

'Twas for her second husband, for the wedding.

My father had died many years before.

Our nanny, the evil

Miss Blackwood...

Black Death, we used to call her.

Because of superstition, she refused to help me sew the dress, as she believed it would bring her bad fortune, to never be a bride.

Not that anyone would have had her.

And she seemed ancient to us, I have no idea how old she actually was, and monstrously ugly.

So...

I worked alone for months and months, hunched over, sewing and sweating and sewing.

And the Black Death never married anyway.

All the help I could have had from her.

'Twas my sister, Cyril, came to my rescue in the end.

There are endless superstitions when making a wedding dress.

Young girls afraid they'll never marry if they touch one.

Or models afraid they'll marry only bald men if they put one on.

And where's the dress now?

I have no idea what happened to it.

No idea.

Most probably turned to ashes by now.

Fallen to pieces.

And your sister?

What?

Did she ever marry?

No.

C'mon, boys, let's have a fire.

If you want to have a staring contest with me, you will lose.

You're a very handsome man.

You must be around many beautiful women.

Yes.

So, why are you not married?

I make dresses.

You cannot be married when you make dresses?

I'm certain I was never meant to marry.

I'm a confirmed bachelor.

I'm incurable.

Marriage would make me deceitful and I don't ever want that.

You sound so sure about things.

I'm sure about that.

I think you're only acting strong.

No, I am strong.

For who? Not for me, I hope.

I think it's the expectations and assumptions of others that cause heartache.

Would you help me with something?

- Yes.

- Come on.

Good. Just jump up on the box for me.

I think we're going to try and pull this back for you.

Pretty good.

One moment.

We'll save that one for another time.

Quite nice.

But...

Bit serious.

This one.

Do you like it?

- Yes.

- It's very good.

That's it.

Let's get that off you, and then

I'd like to take your measurements. Is that all right?

And who's this lovely creature making the house smell so nice?

Hello, I'm Alma.

I'm Cyril.

Sandalwood and rose water.

Sherry, and...

Lemon juice?

We had fish for dinner.

My old so-and-so. Would you mind?

Can you step towards me? Ready?

Thirty-two.

Thirty.

Thirty-one.

Thirty-five and a half.

Fourteen and a half...

Seventeen...

Twenty.

- Can you just stand normally?

- Yes.

- I stand normally.

- Like before.

- What do you mean?

- Straight.

- Straight.

- Like that.

Yeah, you didn't say that.

Sixteen and a half.

Eight and a half.

You have no breasts.

Twenty-two.

- Yes, I know.

- Thirty-two and a half.

You can drop your arm now.

- I'm sorry.

- No, no, you're perfect.

My job to give you some, if I choose to.

Ten.

Nine.

Six and a half.

Twenty-five.

And 45. That's it.

Would you try something else for me?

Yes.

You have the ideal shape.

I do?

He likes a little belly.

I never really liked myself.

I thought my shoulders were too wide, my neck was skinny like a bird, that I had no breasts.

I felt my hips were larger than needed, and my arms too strong.

I feel as if I've been looking for you for a very long time.

You found me.

Whatever you do, do it carefully.

But in his work, I become perfect.

And I feel just right.

Good evening, Mr Woodcock, sir.

Maybe that's how all women feel in his clothes.

You look beautiful, really.

Very beautiful.

You're making me extremely hungry.

- Thank you.

- I ordered you a steak tartare.

Oh, perfect. Thank you.

My little carnivore.

I've just been on the telephone to your favourite client.

Barbara Rose is getting married again.

Oh, goody.

All right. Well...

Think I'd better have another one of these.

That's your room.

I'm right next door.

Get your rest.

We'll start early in the morning.

How early?

I'll wake you.

Good night.

Good night.

Sometimes we wake up at 4:00 in the morning, after we've gone to bed at midnight.

And then he's ready to start again.

And I can stand endlessly.

No one can stand as long as I can.

What is it, Alma?

What are you looking so forlorn about?

I don't know, I...

I think I don't like the fabric so much.

Well, Alma, this fabric is adored by the women who wear our design.

It's perfect for this dress.

Cyril is right.

Cyril is always right.

It's not because the fabric is adored by the clients that

Cyril is right.

It's right because it's right.

Because it's beautiful.

Maybe one day you'll change your taste, Alma.

Maybe not.

Maybe you have no taste.

Maybe I like my own taste.

Yes, just enough to get you into trouble.

- Perhaps I'm looking for trouble.

- Stop.

You know, at the big races and the Derby and, those...

- Yes?

- Excuse me, Mr Woodcock.

I would like to say that I hope one day I could wear one of your dresses.

Oh, thank you.

If that's your wish, I hope it comes true for you.

She really means it.

She told me she wants to be buried in a dress that you make.

Thank you.

Thank you, ladies, for your kind words.

Good night.

- Thank you.

- Thank you.

- Good night. Thank you very much.

- Good night.

You'd dig her up and sell the dress again, wouldn't you, Nigel?

Well, otherwise it would seem to be going to a waste, but, yeah, I mean, one but can try.

Nigel, why aren't you eating your profiteroles?

What?

Have you had enough to eat?

You seem thirsty.

Morning, Reynolds.

Morning, Cyril.

Please, don't move so much, Alma.

I'm buttering my toast,

I'm not moving too much.

Well, it's too much.

It's a distraction, it's very distracting.

Maybe you pay too much attention to it.

It's hard to ignore.

It's as if you just rode a horse across the room.

This is too much movement.

It is entirely too much movement at breakfast.

Perhaps you should take your breakfast after him.

Or in your room.

I think he's being too fussy.

His routine, when he's in it, is best not shaken.

- Well...

- This is a quiet time, not to be misused.

If breakfast isn't right, it's very hard for him to recover for the rest of the day.

I didn't know that.

No, of course you didn't.

But you do now.

Still I think he's too fussy.

Well, that's as may be.

This is Flemish bobbin lace from the late 1600s.

It's very rare, very precious.

I rescued it from

Antwerp during the war.

I've been waiting for the right moment to...

To make something with it.

Hold it.

That's very nice.

That's beautiful.

- That's good.

- Best yet. Beautiful.

Very nice. Turn towards the light.

Just look towards the window, please, Alma.

Amber, could you just lift the bodice, a little bit?

It keeps dropping down.

We need to get that adjusted properly. It's ridiculous.

- Just get it fixed.

- Yes, sir.

Should've been ready today, quite honestly.

Keep your eye on that.

- Together.

- I'm not sitting on the floor.

Sit on the floor.

You're lovely.

Ah, it's great. That's great.

Okay, hold that while

I change the film.

Have I finished yet?

All right, that's it.

I need to do some work.

Hell.

Yes?

May I come in?

I'm working.

Do you need anything?

It's fabulous on the shoulders.

Shoulder drapes, and then you can put it on completely.

Okay?

Good, good, good.

Alma? Is she ready?

Nearly.

Come on, please.

Ingrid.

Cape's wrong. Let me do it.

Let me do it.

Ellie, you ready? Let's have a look at you.

Stand here, please.

All right.

Off you go. Thank you,

Pippa. Ingrid, you ready?

Let me do it, let me do it. Damn it.

You're no good to me just standing there, Pippa.

- I need your hands on this.

- Sorry, sir. Sorry. Yes.

Just go. Go, go.

I'm sorry.

Let me drive for you.

You see, when you...

When you love your work and you can give like he does...

You need to come down again.

And then he's...

He's a baby.

Like a spoiled little baby.

When he's like this, he's very tender.

Open.

How long will these episodes last?

Only a few days, and then he's well again.

- No. Alma, what are you doing?

- There's tea for you.

Don't put the tray on the table, please. Just take it off.

I didn't ask for tea.

No, but...

Can you take it out, please?

Yes, I can take it out.

- It's a bit late now, isn't it?

- I'm taking it out.

Yeah, but it's a bit late now, isn't it?

But I'm taking it out.

The tea is going out, the interruption is staying right here with me.

What if they are yellow underneath and white on top?

The poison ones have gills.

Look at the book in the kitchen.

We cook them in fat?

No, we'll cook them in butter.

But not too much.

Mr Woodcock detests too much butter.

There's a very good chance Barbara Rose will ask you to attend her wedding.

What do you want me to do with that?

Accept her invitation.

If you can stomach it.

I really wish I hadn't heard this till later on, Cyril.

It's very unsettling.

Well, chin up.

Barbara Rose pays for this house.

All right?

Morning, Barbara.

Morning, Cal. Morning, Tippy.

Good morning, - Mr Woodcock.

Reynolds.

Let's get started.

Put it in there.

Thank you.

I'm just going to lift this up, Barbara.

Oh.

I know you're doing the best you can.

Don't do that.

- Take your hand away, please.

- I'm still so ugly.

Barbara, I'm trying to make you a beautiful dress.

I need your help.

Please.

Reynolds, will you come?

Just stand still, please.

It's really not my place, Barbara.

This is what I do.

This is my place, here.

I'm afraid I must insist that you come.

George Riley, News of the World.

Who'll be the attendant at the wedding?

My son, Cal.

My Cal, my son.

He's so wonderful, he's so in favour of this marriage.

John Evans, Daily Mail.

And what of your holdings, Miss Rose?

Do they become Dominican property?

- I don't know, I don't think so.

- If I may say, we are being married under Dominican law, but in my country, her money belongs to her and my money belongs to me.

Anyway, why would I need her money? I have enough of my own.

What's Barbara brought into your life?

I brought sincerity into his life.

- Sincerity?

- Then one kiss for the cameras.

Go on, give us a kiss for the cameras, Miss Rose.

The answer to the question

- is sincerity.

- Let's give them a kiss...

Rubio, tell us about selling visas to the Jews during the war.

Thank you.

Visas? Jews?

- Thank you very much, gentlemen.

- Thank you for that.

Jews, visas?

That dress doesn't belong here.

- Don't start crying.

- I'm not crying.

I'm angry.

Well, don't start blubbering, Alma.

I'm not blubbering.

She doesn't deserve it.

It's your work.

Come on.

Tippy?

Mr Woodcock.

- What is it?

- I would like the dress back.

Miss Rose is sleeping.

Well, that's got nothing to do with the dress.

Can you go and get it for me, please?

She's sleeping.

In the dress?

Well, yes.

Go and take the dress off her and bring it to me right away.

I don't think so.

Take the fucking dress off Barbara and bring it to me or

I'll do it myself.

I beg your pardon?

Alma.

- Hello, Mr Woodcock.

- Cal.

I...

It's no business of ours what Mrs Rose decides to do with her life.

But she can no longer behave like this and be dressed by the

House of Woodcock.

Thank you.

I love you.

- Pedigree. That's for mother.

- Racy.

She'd like something like that, but...

- Thank you, dear.

- It's Mona's day.

Yes, it is.

So I'd like to wear something for her.

- Yes, of course.

- She mentioned that last time.

- Did she?

- Yeah.

- Did she really?

- Yeah.

All right.

- Julie.

- Yes, sir.

- Do we have porridge?

- Yes, we do.

- Do we have cream?

- We do, yes.

- Thick cream?

- Oh, yes.

That's what I'd like for breakfast, please.

- All right, sir.

- Don't forget the salt this time.

I shan't, I shan't.

Oh, Alma, would you like some porridge...

- Yes.

- This morning?

- Some for Alma as well, please.

- Right away.

And, bacon and eggs with that.

All right, sir.

Morning.

I'm so hungry.

Delighted that we have cream in the house.

- Yes.

- Makes all the difference.

It's essential with porridge.

A little bit naughty though.

- Dear Reynolds.

- Your Royal Highness.

- Hello.

- How beautiful you are.

- How nice to see you again.

- Your Royal Highness.

- Cyril.

- Your Highness.

- Hello.

- How lovely to see you.

Good morning.

When you dream about your wedding dress, what is it that you dream?

I dream that it's the most beautiful wedding dress in the world.

Naturally.

Perhaps the only wedding dress in the world.

Yes.

Or to take it just a little step further, perhaps the only wedding dress that was ever made.

Oui.

Is Your Royal Highness a gold person or a silver person?

- Silver.

- Good.

Lace or pearl?

Lace.

Very good.

Merci.

I want to wish you good fortune for your wedding.

Thank you.

Je m'appelle Alma.

Lovely to meet you, Alma.

I live here.

Come in.

Alma.

Good morning, Cyril.

I wanted to ask your help in a gift

I wanted to make for Reynolds.

I want to make him a surprise.

If everyone left the house when he takes his walk on Thursday,

I will cook for him, dinner.

And when he comes back, no one will be there but me.

I'll be waiting for him,

I will surprise him and we can have dinner together, just the two of us.

Do you like this idea?

Would you help me?

It isn't his birthday.

I know.

I would advise against this, Alma.

Why?

Because he doesn't like surprises.

- He does.

- Well, he won't like this one.

I'm trying to surprise him and love him the way that I want to.

Well, if you're looking for something kind to do, perhaps you could think of something else.

No, I really must advise against this, Alma.

I don't think there could be a more inappropriate time to try something new.

This is what I want to do, and I think it will be very nice.

I respect your advice, Cyril.

But I have to know him in my own way, and this is what I want to do for him.

Good night.

- Good night.

- Good night, madame.

Good night, madame.

Good luck.

Oh, Alma. What is this?

I love you, Reynolds.

Yes, but what is this?

It's a surprise.

Are you hungry?

Where is Cyril?

I've sent everyone home.

Where is Cyril?

She's left.

What time did she leave?

This afternoon.

I've made us dinner.

Let me collect myself for a moment.

I'll just have a bath, I think.

This is very kind of you, Alma.

Would you like a champagne or a Martini?

No, thank you.

Oh, is that your dress? It's finished.

Let's have a look at it.

It's rather interesting.

Very good work.

I'll just have my bath now.

When will Cyril get back?

Tonight?

How was your appointment with the princess?

She's very beautiful, like a sculpture of some kind.

So will you make her a wedding gown?

I have made her baptism, her First Communion and confirmation dresses.

I made the dress for her presentation at court, indeed the entire wardrobe for her coming out season.

It's only right that

I should make her wedding dress, wouldn't you think?

- Christ.

- No.

But this is not what

I wanted to say.

I'm sorry, I don't know what I said, I...

This is meant to be a nice evening.

Let me serve you.

Do you like it?

I do.

No, you don't.

You don't like it at all.

Usually, you always tell me what you think.

What is this?

You're lying.

As I think you know, Alma,

I prefer my asparagus with oil and salt.

And knowing this, you've prepared the asparagus with butter.

Now, I can imagine in certain circumstances being able to pretend that

I like it made this way.

Right now, I'm just admiring my own gallantry for eating it the way you've prepared it.

I don't know what I'm doing here.

I don't know what I'm doing here.

I'm just waiting around like an idiot for you.

This was an ambush,

Alma. To what purpose?

This is not...

I know it's not going as I expected.

I didn't mean these things to come out.

I'm sorry, but it was meant to be nice.

Well, what did you expect?

I wanted time with you. I wanted to have you to myself.

- You have me all the time.

- No.

What on earth are you talking about?

I don't.

There are always people around.

And if not, then there's something between us.

- Something between us?

- Yes.

- What?

- Some...

- What?

- Distance.

When did this happen?

What happened to make you behave like this?

Is it because you think

I don't need you?

- Yes.

- I don't.

Well, that's very predictable of you.

Don't act so tough.

I know you are not.

Yeah, that's right. That's right. If I don't protect myself somebody will come in the middle of the night and take over my corner of the room and ask me about their fucking asparagus.

Don't be a bully.

You're being a bully.

There are other things I'd like to do with my time. It's my time.

I have no idea what I'm doing here in your time.

- My time.

- What am I doing here?

I'm standing around like an idiot waiting for you.

- Waiting for what?

- Waiting for you.

Waiting for what?

Waiting for you to get rid of me.

To tell me to leave.

So tell me.

So I don't stand around like a fucking fool.

Asparagus, is this all about your asparagus?

- No, it's not about asparagus.

- Then what the hell is it about?

Are you a special agent sent here to ruin my evening and possibly my entire life?

Why are you so rude to me?

Why are you talking to me like this?

Is this my house?

- This is my house, isn't it?

- Yes, this is your house.

- Is this my house?

- Of course it's your house.

Or did somebody drop me on foreign soil.

- What a question.

- Behind enemy lines?

- It's you who brought me here.

- I'm surrounded on all sides.

It's you who brought me here.

When the hell did this happen? Who are you?

Do you have a gun?

You here to kill me?

- Why are you...

- Do you have a gun?

- Stop it.

- Where's your gun?

- Stop being a child.

- Where's your gun?

- Stop playing.

- Show me your gun.

Stop playing this game.

- I am not.

- I'm not playing a game.

- Yes. Huh.

- What game am I playing?

What game? What precisely is the nature of my game?

- You tell me.

- Oh, this whole...

- What?

- All your rules and your walls and your doors and your people and your money and all these clothes and everything.

This, this, this game.

Everything here.

The whole... Pfft.

Nothing is normal or natural or...

Everything is a game.

"Yes, mister. No, madam. Yes."

Well... if it's my...

"I don't eat this. I don't drink that.

"I don't..."

If it's my life that you're describing, it's entirely up to you whether you choose to share it or not.

If you don't wish to share that life, as apparently it's so disagreeable to you in every respect, why don't you just fuck off to back where you came from?

Yeah.

Sometimes it's good for him to slow down his steps a little.

Would you like me to ask Alma to leave?

No. Why?

Well, if you're going to make her a ghost, go ahead and do it.

But, please, don't let her sit around waiting for you.

I'm very fond of her.

Oh, you're very fond of her, are you? In that case...

No, don't turn it on me. I don't want your cloud on my head.

- Oh, shut up, Cyril.

- No, you can shut right up.

Don't pick a fight with me, you certainly won't come out alive.

I'll go right through you and it'll be you who ends up on the floor.

Understood?

- Morning, Pippa.

- Morning, sir.

Pen, book and glasses?

Yes, they're all there for you, sir.

- Morning, ladies.

- Good morning, sir.

Excellent work, ladies.

It's just not very good, is it?

It's ugly.

You all right, sir?

Reynolds?

Reynolds, are you all right?

Mr Woodcock, he seems to be ill.

Who seems to be ill?

Mr Woodcock, he's fallen over and he's damaged the dress.

I'm sorry, Biddy.

Who's fallen over?

Mr Woodcock, he's fallen over and he's damaged the dress.

There's stains on the front of the skirt and there's a hole in the lace on the bodice and there's shoe polish on the front of the dress.

Shoe polish from what?

From his shoe.

I'm fine.

Oh, I don't know what the hell came over me.

Must be something I've eaten.

Oh, God.

- You should lie down now.

- No, I'll be fine in a minute.

Please lie down.

No, really, don't fuss, Alma, please.

Just don't fuss.

Whatever it is, if you fuss, I'll die right here.

I promise I won't fuss.

Let me do that, please.

- I have to take these off.

- Yes, I'll take them off.

Alma? Alma?

Yes?

Would you tell them

I'll be down shortly?

Yes, of course.

Hello, Cyril.

Hello.

What is it?

I don't know what the bloody hell came over me.

I'll be all right in a moment.

Oh, you don't look all right.

Where does it hurt?

Hurts all over.

I've never really felt like this before.

Is it your stomach? Is it something you've eaten?

No, I don't think so.

Just sore, really.

So please tell them I'll be with them in a minute.

No, you're not going anywhere.

You're to stay here and rest.

Would you like me to do anything?

Just give me silence.

Shall I call the doctor?

No, Cyril, you certainly will not, please.

All right.

- Exhausted yourself.

- Just give me silence.

Burning up.

You take care of the dress for me.

Yes, of course I will.

It's all right.

I just...

I just want...

That's it.

Come on, Alma.

I think I may be sick again.

We're gonna have to do a lot of work to get this dress ready for tomorrow, you know.

We're gonna have to undo the front of the dress and replace the skirt.

We're gonna have to cut a new panel of the satin and then there's also the organza that needs to be...

Yes, I'll deal with that in a minute, Biddy. Thank you.

You're soaked. We need to change your pyjamas.

I'm scared, Alma.

Yes, of course you are.

Do you think I'll ever get better?

Of course.

I'll take care of you.

Madam, there's a telephone call.

He's settled now, sleeping.

- The doctor's here.

- What doctor?

The doctor I sent for.

- Oh, no, but he doesn't...

- He needs to be examined.

- No.

- Yes.

No, he's not dying.

He needs to be examined.

He's sleeping now.

That's what he needs.

Let me be unambiguous.

Come out of the room and downstairs immediately.

All right.

Alma, this is Dr Hardy.

How do you do, Mrs Woodcock?

How do you do?

How's he feeling?

He's better. He's sleeping.

Is he able to keep anything down yet?

He hasn't tried yet.

I was going to make some soup.

And his fever?

It has gone down.

Would you like me to see him?

Yes.

- Is that all right, Mrs Woodcock?

- Yes, it is.

Reynolds, Lady Baltimore has sent her godson to see you.

Dr Hardy.

Hello, Mr Woodcock.

May I examine you?

Keep your hands off me.

I'd just like to take your temperature.

Alma, there's a strange boy in the room. Can you get him out, please?

I admit I do look young, but I...

Fuck off.

Reynolds, please, just let him examine you.

Yes, fuck off.

I think this is clear.

He wants you to fuck off.

I'm so sorry, Doctor.

- I'm very sorry.

- Not to worry.

I'll drop by tomorrow morning to see how he's coming along.

- 9:00 a.m?

- Yes.

If his fever increases during the night, you'll telephone me?

Of course, Doctor.

- Good night, Mrs Woodcock.

- Good night, Doctor.

Follow me.

When will it be ready?

I don't know.

Let me put it another way.

This dress will be ready by 9:00 a.m. because that's when it leaves for Belgium.

Ladies, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid you'll have to work late this evening.

The dress needs to be ready by 9:00 a.m. to make its journey to Belgium.

Do expect to be here for quite some time.

If you need to use the telephone, please use the one in my office...

- Nana and Biddy...

- to alert your families.

What can I do to help?

Could you pin the ribbon on the hem there, please? Thank you.

Ladies, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid you'll have to work late this evening.

The dress needs to be ready by 9:00 a.m. and I know there's rather a lot to do on it still.

So please do expect to be here possibly for most of the night.

If you need to make telephone calls, do so from my office. Thank you.

Are you here?

Are you always here?

I miss you.

I think about you all the time.

I hear your voice say my name when I dream.

Then when I wake up, there are tears streaming down my face.

I just miss you, it's as simple as that.

I want to tell you everything.

I don't understand what you're saying.

I can't hear your voice.

Your fever's gone down.

I love you, Alma.

I don't ever want to be without you.

I love you.

I have things I want to do.

I had thought my days were unlimited.

The mistakes I've made and made again, they can no longer be ignored.

There are things nagging at me.

Things that now must be done.

Things I simply cannot do without you.

To keep my sour heart from choking.

To break a curse.

A house that doesn't change is a dead house.

Alma, will you marry me?

Will you marry me?

What the bloody hell are you thinking about?

Will you marry me?

No?

Yes.

Will you marry me?

Yes, I will.

Reynolds to Alma, when you say these binding and contracting words, you'll be looking at each other.

After all, it is each other you are marrying and not me.

Reynolds... I call upon these persons here present...

I call upon these persons here present...

To witness that I, Reynolds

Jeremiah Woodcock...

Do take thee, Alma Elson...

Do take thee, Alma Elson...

To be my lawful wedded wife...

To be my lawful wedded wife.

Alma... I call upon these persons here present...

I call upon these persons here present...

To witness that I, Alma Elson...

To witness that I, Alma Elson...

Do take thee, Reynolds

Jeremiah Woodcock...

Do take thee, Reynolds

Jeremiah Woodcock...

To be my lawful wedded husband.

To be my lawful wedded husband.

And it now gives me great pleasure to say...

Congratulations. You are now husband and wife.

And you may kiss the bride.

- An hour?

- An hour? That's okay.

Cuckoo.

- I'll see you later.

- See you later.

- Have a good time.

- You, too.

You, too, have a good time.

Not for me, thank you.

Dr Hardy?

- Dr Hardy?

- Oh. Hey. Sorry, excuse me.

Reynolds, do you remember Dr Hardy?

Good evening, Mr and Mrs Woodcock.

Oh, hello.

How do you do, Mr Woodcock?

How are you feeling?

I think we met in a puddle of sweat, didn't we?

Yes, that's right.

I probably owe you an apology of some kind.

I seem to remember barking at you.

There's no need.

I've been laid siege by much worse.

Oh, really?

You look very healthy.

How are you feeling?

Didn't I tell you to fuck off?

Yes. Yes, you did.

Dinner is served, everybody.

Come along.

That's your shifty-eyed godson?

Shifty-eyed?

He's got perfectly normal eyes.

I'm rather less fat, I think, than when you last saw me.

- Really?

- Yes.

Thank you very much indeed.

It's fallen off me.

Ooh. I'm so sorry.

There are secrets nobody tells.

Your wife has got that gorgeous glow you get with a first marriage.

How long will you be here for?

Seems my godson's rather enjoying that glow as well.

So, what are your plans for New Year's Eve?

Oh...

We don't have any.

Well, you should come out for the Chelsea Arts Club Ball.

- I don't know what that is.

- It's not something I'd suggest if I didn't think you'd have a wonderful time.

It's really something to be seen.

I'll pass it on to my husband.

But I think we'll stay in.

Change your mind.

Or get him to change his mind, or whatever it takes.

Now, please come. I promise you the time of your life.

How do you know how my life has been?

I don't.

You're right.

I think this would be quite a fine time, if you'd like to come.

She's barely looked at you this evening, has she?

I think they're well and truly shaken now.

What on earth are you doing?

- I rolled a three.

- Yes, but that's the four pip.

Go back to the bar where you belong.

Oh, sorry.

Let's not start cheating at this stage, Alma.

I'm not cheating. I don't need to cheat.

Oh, good. You do need to be able to count, on the other hand.

Backgammon, by the way,

I get treble the score because you haven't gotten any checkers off the board.

Oh.

Stupid game anyway.

Well, maybe it seems stupid to you now as you're currently losing, but I dare say if you were victorious,

I'm confident you'd see it in a different light.

Now, they need your chair for my next opponent. Next.

Me, please.

What? What are you so cranky about?

Have fun with your next opponent.

Why, I think I will, a lot more than I did with you.

Gosh. She's really very rude, isn't she?

My heart breaks for you.

Oh, really?

Being married to a toddler.

I don't want to be racist, but, I mean, is there some sort of custom at this time of the night in her country, where...

- I mean, what's she doing?

- Where what?

I don't know. I don't know if she's up stealing things or attacking people, I mean...

I want to go dancing.

When?

Right now.

- You're joking.

- No, I'm not.

It's New Year's Eve.

Well, I'm not going dancing.

There's a party at the Devonshire

Hall to celebrate the New Year and I want to go.

We need to go dancing.

So what are you going to do about it?

I'm going to stay right here and I'm going to work.

On the hour, ladies and gentlemen.

Are you ready to welcome in our lovely, glorious, Happy New Year?

Are you ready?

Here we go.

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Happy New Year.

How does it feel?

Well, I think it feels a little big.

Shall we just take it in on the waist?

We can take it in a little on the waist.

- Yes.

- Yes, okay. Just take it out.

How's that feeling? I think that's better.

Would you excuse me for a minute, please, Mrs Vaughan?

Where has Henrietta Harding been?

- She's been to another house.

- Which one?

- Why didn't you tell me?

- Because I didn't want to.

Is there something I'm unaware of?

Because as far as I can remember, all I have done is to dress her beautifully.

I don't think that matters to some people.

I think they want what is fashionable and chic.

Chic? Oh, don't you start using that filthy little word. "Chic"?

Whoever invented that ought to be spanked in public. I don't...

I don't even know what that word means.

What is that word? Fucking "chic"?

They should be hung, drawn and quartered. Fucking "chic".

It shouldn't concern you. It does concern me.

It concerns me very much, Cyril, because it's hurt my feelings.

It's hurt my feelings.

So, what's all this moaning about?

I am not moaning.

I do not like to be turned away from.

Nobody does.

But I don't want to hear it because it hurts my ears.

I've made a terrible mistake in my life, Cyril. I've made a...

I've made a terrible mistake.

I need you to help me.

What do you want me to do?

I can't work. I can't concentrate,

I have no confidence.

She does not fit in this house.

We built this house, the two of us.

Now, she's turning the whole bloody place upside down.

She's turning me inside out.

She's turning you and me against each other.

Her arrival has cast a very long shadow, Cyril.

Mrs Vaughan is satisfied with the dress.

No one gives a tinker's fucking curse about Mrs Vaughan's satisfaction.

Thank you, Alma.

Not at all.

What a model of politeness you two are.

There is an air of quiet death in this house and I do not like the way it smells.

Would you like a glass of wine?

No, thank you.

Can I make you a Martini?

Nothing for me, thanks.

Water?

I want you flat on your back.

Helpless.

Tender.

Open.

With only me to help.

And then I want you strong again.

You're not going to die.

You might wish you were going to die, but you're not going to.

You need to settle down a little.

Kiss me, my girl, before I'm sick.

I think, perhaps, you should telephone that boy doctor of yours, just in case.

You don't trust me?

No, I do trust you. It's just...

If you wish.

But I will make you well again.

I will.

I love you.

I love you, too.

And I think, perhaps, you should leave the room.

- Close the door behind you.

- Yes.

I'll be right outside.

If he didn't wake up from this, if he wasn't here tomorrow, no matter.

For I know he'd be waiting for me in the afterlife.

Or some safe, celestial place in this life and the next and the next one after.

And for whatever there is on the road that follows from here, it would only require my patience to get to him again.

You see, to be in love with him makes life no great mystery.

Say, "Ah."

Very good.

You can put your robe back on.

Sometimes I jump ahead in our life together.

And I see a time near the end.

I can predict the future and everything has settled.

And all our lovers and children and friends come back and are welcome.

And we have large gatherings where everyone is laughing and playing games.

I am older and I see things differently, and I finally understand you.

And I take care of your dresses.

Keeping them from dust and ghosts and time.

Yes, but right now, we're here.

Yes, of course we are.

And I'm getting hungry.





# Portrait of a Lady on Fire

First, my contours.

The outline.

Not too fast.

Take time to look at me.

See how my arms are placed.

My hands.

Who brought that painting out?

From the stock. I shouldn't have?

No.

Did you paint it?

Yes.

A long time ago.

What's the title?

Portrait of a Lady on Fire.

Where do I go?

Head straight up toward the trees.

I'm Marianne.

It was a reception room.

I've never seen it used.

-Have you been here long?

-Three years.

Do you like it here?

Yes.

I'll let you get dry.

Sorry, I helped myself.

I was hungry.

-Is there any wine?

-Yes.

May I be curious?

What is your young mistress like?

I don't know her well.

You've been here three years.

She only arrived a few weeks ago.

Where from?

The Benedictines.

Has she left holy orders?

They brought her home.

Because her sister died.

She was the one due to marry?

Did disease take her?

No.

Will you manage it?

Manage what?

To paint her.

Why do you ask?

Another painter was here.

He wasn't able to.

What happened?

I don't know.

I'm afraid it's the only one.

She has no dresses yet and wears her convent clothes.

-She has blond hair?

-Yes.

This will do.

Do you recognize it?

My father painted it.

One of his first.

It was in Milan, before my marriage.

My daughter's suitor is Milanese.

We'll go there if he likes the portrait.

You'll leave.

I have to tell you... she wore out one painter before you.

In a very simple manner: she refused to pose.

-He never saw her face.

-Why won't she be painted?

She refuses this marriage.

You must paint her without her knowing.

She thinks you're a companion for walks.

She's delighted.

Since she arrived, I don't let her out.

Why not?

I wasn't wary enough with her sister.

She thinks I'll watch over her.

And you, observe her.

Is painting her that way feasible?

More than being a companion.

The portrait arrived here before me.

When I first entered this room,

I found myself facing my image hanging on the wall.

She was waiting for me.

She's waiting to go out.

Come in.

Tell me, what happened to your mistress?

How did she die?

We were walking by the cliffs.

She was behind me and vanished.

I saw her broken body below.

-Did you see her fall?

-No.

I think she jumped.

Why do you think that?

She didn't cry out.

I've dreamt of that for years.

Dying?

Running.

One must show the ear

and study its cartilage closely,

even if covered with hair.

It must be of a warm and transparent hue,

except for the hole,

which is always strong.

Its tone, even in light,

must yield to the cheek...

which is more prominent.

Did you bring a book?

Yes.

May I borrow it?

I'll fetch it.

Thank you.

It's odd you sleep here.

Miss?

Miss!

She's waiting.

-Is she downstairs?

-Yes.

I must cover you up. It's windy.

I'd like to bathe.

On a calmer day.

Yes.

How long will you stay?

Six more days.

Do you swim?

I don't know.

It's too dangerous if you don't.

I meant, I don't know if I can swim.

How was your day?

Difficult.

She always stays ahead of me and walks alone on the beach.

Have you started painting?

Not yet.

I haven't even seen her smile.

Have you tried to be funny?

Is it unfinished?

My sister was embroidering it.

Do you think she wanted to die?

You're the first person unafraid to ask that.

Apart from you?

Not out loud. But yes.

In her last letter, she apologized.

For no reason.

What could she be apologizing for?

For leaving me her fate.

You make it sound terrible.

What do you know of my marriage?

You're to wed a Milanese gentleman, that's all.

That's all I know too.

You see why it worries me.

Put that way, yes.

I put it the way it is.

You'd rather have stayed in the convent?

It's a life that has advantages.

There's a library.

You can sing or hear music.

And equality is a pleasant feeling.

I found the convent unjust.

I left after my first communion.

They punished me for drawing in my notebooks' margins.

You draw?

Yes. A little.

What about you? When will you marry?

I don't know if I will.

-You don't have to?

-No.

I'll take over my father's business.

You can choose.

That's why you don't understand me.

I understand you.

How are your days?

We return late and I have little light to work.

I'll keep her here tomorrow afternoon.

You'll be free to make progress.

Perhaps you could allow her to go out alone.

Fear not. She isn't sad, but angry.

You think I don't know her anger?

I know it well.

Yes, I know it too.

Where did you learn Italian?

In Milan.

You know Milan?

I can't wait to go back.

It's 20 years since I was there.

Tell her Milan is beautiful.

And that life will be sweeter.

She doesn't talk much to me.

I'm not marrying her to the local gentry.

I'm trying... to take her elsewhere.

She'll be less bored there.

And you too.

Indeed. Why not?

I'll leave for the coast at the same time as you.

If you don't have to return to Paris,

I have a friend who'd like her portrait done.

Thank you.

It won't be easy.

My friend is particularly ugly.

She's very ugly!

You've made me laugh.

It's ages since that happened.

I didn't do anything.

You're here.

It takes two to be funny.

Marianne?

Do you have tobacco?

Yes.

Your mother will let you go out alone tomorrow.

You'll be free.

Being free is being alone?

You don't think so?

I'll tell you tomorrow.

I'll go to mass.

To receive Communion?

I want to hear music.

Organ music is pretty but bleak.

It's all I know.

-You've never heard an orchestra?

-No.

Have you?

Tell me about it.

It's not easy to relate music.

What is it?

A piece that I love.

Is it merry?

Not merry, but it's lively.

It's about a coming storm.

The insects sense it.

They become agitated.

Then the storm breaks.

With lightning and the wind.

I can't remember it.

You'll hear the rest.

Milan is a city of music.

Then I can't wait for Milan.

I'm saying there will be good things.

You're saying that, now and then...

I'll be consoled.

How was mass?

-You look cheerful.

-I sang a lot.

-Are you leaving me already?

-Yes.

Will you come out tomorrow?

Yes.

In solitude,

I felt the liberty you spoke of.

But I also felt I missed you.

The portrait is finished.

Are you happy with it?

I think so.

Let's go to see it.

May I ask a favor?

Go on.

I'd like to show her first.

And tell her the truth myself.

I understand.

She's very fond of you.

How do you know?

She talks about you.

Héloïse...

I must tell you something.

I'm a painter.

I came here to paint you.

I've finished your portrait.

I see now why you praised the charms of exile.

You felt guilty.

Are you leaving?

Later today. With your mother.

Then I shall bathe today.

Well, can you swim?

I still don't know if I can.

Did you see me?

You can float.

Let's go back.

It explains all your looks.

You're saying nothing?

Is that me?

Yes.

Is that how you see me?

It's not only me.

What do you mean, not only you?

There are rules, conventions, ideas.

You mean there's no life?

No presence?

Your presence is made up of fleeting moments that may lack truth.

Not everything is fleeting.

Some feelings are deep.

The fact it isn't close to me, that I can understand.

But I find it sad it isn't close to you.

How do you know it isn't close to me?

I didn't know you were an art critic.

I didn't know you were a painter.

I'll fetch my mother.

It wasn't good enough. I'll start again.

You're joking.

I'm sorry. It wasn't satisfactory.

You're incompetent then. You can leave.

She's staying.

I'll pose for her.

Really?

Yes.

Why?

What does it change for you?

Nothing.

I'll be away five days.

When I return, it will be finished.

And I decide, not you.

Understood?

Say good-bye like when you were little.

Sit down.

Turn your chest towards me.

A little more.

Turn your head slightly.

Rest your arm here.

-Not like that. May I?

-Yes.

Take your hand.

The other way.

Like this.

-Are you comfortable?

-Yes.

-Can you hold this position?

-Yes.

Look at me.

The heat will do you good.

The cherrystones hold it in.

Thank you.

I usually have one ready, but I haven't had my monthlies.

More than once?

Three times.

-Is this the first time?

-Yes.

-Do you want a child?

-No.

I was waiting for Madam to leave to see to it.

-I can't.

-A little more.

I can't go on.

No.

It mustn't be in flower.

It's ready.

-Will it be enough?

-We'll see.

Has it happened to you?

Yes.

You've known love.

Yes.

What is it like?

It's hard to say.

I mean, how does it feel?

I can't make you smile.

I feel I do it and then it vanishes.

Anger always comes to the fore.

Definitely with you.

I didn't mean to hurt you.

-You haven't hurt me.

-I have, I can tell.

When you're moved, you do this with your hand.

-Really?

-Yes.

And when you're embarrassed... you bite your lips.

And when you're annoyed... you don't blink.

You know it all.

Forgive me, I'd hate to be in your place.

We're in the same place.

Exactly the same place.

Come here.

Come.

Step closer.

Look.

If you look at me, who do I look at?

When you don't know what to say, you touch your forehead.

When you lose control, you raise your eyebrows.

And when you're troubled... you breathe through your mouth.

-I didn't touch!

-I win.

I win.

You touched it.

Try to concentrate.

Your turn.

-You're cheating.

-I'm not cheating, I play fast.

-Go on.

-Two.

-Two cards.

-Two.

Two sixes.

-I win.

-You win, yes.

Your turn.

No, go on.

Go on!

Uncover your throat.

More.

You have my future husband in mind.

Do you paint nude models too?

Women, yes.

Why not men?

I'm not allowed to.

Why not?

Because I'm a woman.

Is it a matter of modesty?

It's mostly to prevent us from doing great art.

Without any notion of male anatomy, the major subjects escape us.

-How do you manage?

-I do it in secret.

It's tolerated.

What do you tell your models... to amuse them?

-Are you bored?

-No.

I'm interested in you.

Your complexion is remarkable today.

You're very elegant.

You pose beautifully.

You're pretty.

That's what I tell them.

"Then, striking the lyre to accompany his words, he sang:

'Oh, Gods of the Underworld to which all mortals descend,

I am here to seek my wife.

A viper that she trod on poisoned her and robbed her of her youth.

I beseech you, unravel the thread of Eurydice's early demise.

All will be yours.

We all end up here.

This is our final abode.

You reign over the human race.

After living out her fair span of years, she will be yours.

If the fates refuse my wife this favor,

I am determined not to return.

You may delight in both our deaths."'

-He's convincing.

-Very .

I hope they say yes.

"Then, for the first time, tears wet the cheeks of the Eumenides, won over by his words.

Neither the king's bride, nor the ruler of Hades could resist his prayer.

They sent for Eurydice.

She was there, among the recent spirits, and approached, limping from her wound.

She was returned to Orpheus on condition that he would not look back until outside or the favor would be void.

In deep silence, they took a sloping path, steep and dark, shrouded in thick mist.

They were nearing the surface, approaching the threshold, when, fearing losing Eurydice and impatient to see her, her loving spouse turned and she was instantly drawn back.

She reached out for his embrace and wished to hold him.

Her poor hands clutched only the empty air.

Dying a second time, she did not complain.

His sole fault was loving her."

That's horrible.

Poor woman. Why did he turn?

He was told not to but did, for no reason.

-There are reasons.

-You think so?

Read it again.

"They were nearing the surface, approaching the threshold, when, fearing losing Eurydice and impatient to see her, her loving spouse turned."

No, he can't look at her for fear of losing her.

That's no reason.

He was told not to do that.

He's madly in love. He can't resist.

I think Sophie has a point.

He could resist.

His reasons aren't serious.

-Perhaps he makes a choice.

-What choice?

He chooses the memory of her.

That's why he turns.

He doesn't make the lover's choice, but the poet's.

"She spoke a last farewell that scarcely reached his ears and fell back into the abyss."

Perhaps she was the one who said...

"Turn around."

She says I'm still pregnant and to come back in two days.

I'll come with you.

What about Héloïse?

She isn't well. She doesn't want dinner.

I thought you had been scared off.

You were right.

I am scared.

Do all lovers feel they're inventing something?

I know the gestures.

I imagined it all, waiting for you.

You dreamt of me?

No.

I thought of you.

You don't want to come anymore?

I'm coming.

Get up.

Wait.

That's good.

Lie down.

Lift your legs.

There.

Thank you.

Deep breaths.

Look.

There, it's over.

Go to bed.

I'll watch over her.

I don't want to go to bed.

Sophie?

Are you asleep?

No.

Can you get up?

Help her.

Get your things.

We're going to paint.

Sophie.

Come here.

Sit down.

Come closer.

Lie down.

Look at her.

Arch your back a little.

Sophie, straighten your head.

Yes.

Stop that.

What?

What you're doing.

Be serious.

Keep still.

I bought it from a woman at the feast.

It's a plant.

She said it makes you fly.

Have you ever tried it?

Never.

-Do you want to?

-Now?

She said it makes time last longer.

Your eyes.

You have to drink.

This time, I like it.

Perhaps because I know you better.

-Perhaps I've changed.

-Perhaps.

You didn't destroy the last one for me.

You did it for you.

I'd like to destroy this one too.

Why?

Through it, I give you to another.

It's terrible.

Now you possess me a little, you bear me a grudge.

-I don't.

-You do.

You know you do.

You're not on my side now.

You blame me for what comes next.

My marriage.

You don't support me.

You're right.

Go on.

Say what burdens your heart.

I believed you braver.

I believed you braver too.

That's it then.

You find me docile.

Worse.

You imagine I'm collusive.

You imagine my pleasure.

It's a way of avoiding hope.

Imagine me happy or unhappy if that reassures you.

But do not imagine me guilty.

You'd prefer me to resist.

Yes.

Are you asking me to?

Answer me.

No.

Have you seen Héloïse?

No. She isn't in her room.

We've had news.

Madam returns tomorrow.

Very well.

Will you be ready?

Yes.

Forgive me.

Forgive me.

Your mother returns tomorrow.

Come here.

With me.

When do we know it's finished?

At one point, we stop.

Finished.

Who is that for?

For me.

You can reproduce that image to infinity.

Yes.

After a while... you'll see her when you think of me.

I'll have no image of you.

Do you want an image of me?

Yes.

Which one?

That one.

Give me your book.

Give me a figure.

28.

Your eyes are closing.

Don't go to sleep.

I feel something new.

What?

Regret.

Don't regret.

Remember.

I'll remember when you fell asleep in the kitchen.

I'll remember... your dark stare when I beat you at cards.

I'll remember the first time you laughed.

You took your time being funny.

That's true.

I wasted time.

I wasted time too.

I'll remember the first time I wanted to kiss you.

When was that?

You didn't notice?

At the gathering around the bonfire.

I wanted to, yes.

But that wasn't the first time.

Tell me.

No, you tell me.

When you asked if I had known love.

I could tell the answer was yes.

And that it was now.

I remember.

-Good morning.

-Good morning.

They're here.

Very good.

For you.

Thank you.

Héloïse. Come with me.

-In a minute.

-No, now.

I have a gift for you.

I'll say good-bye here.

Good-bye.

Have a safe journey.

Turn around.

You've made me look so sad.

You were.

I'm not anymore.

I saw her again a first time.

Are you standing guard?

I'm observing reactions.

Do you want mine?

This Orpheus is excellent.

Your father is in shape.

It's my painting.

I submitted it in his name.

Usually, he's portrayed before he turns or after, as Eurydice dies.

Here, they seem to be saying good-bye.

I saw her one last time.

She didn't see me.





# Tar

You ready?

No, just... Yeah, just... just ignore the microphone.

Yeah, just... just act as if it's not there.

Sing as if it's not there.

Yeah...

(German)

(German)

Okay?

Ready for them?

- Yes.

- Let's go.

If you're here, then you already know who she is and that is one of the most important musical figures of our time.

Lydia Tár is many things: a piano performance graduate at the Curtis Institute

Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard.

She got her PhD in Musicology from the University of Vienna specializing in the indigenous music of the Ucayali Valley in Eastern Peru where she spent five years among the Shipibo-Konibo people.

As a conductor, Tár began her career with the Cleveland Orchestra one of the so-called "Big Five."

A string of important posts followed, including the Philadelphia Orchestra the Chicago Symphony Orchestra the Boston Symphony Orchestra until she at last arrived here at our own New York Philharmonic.

With the latter, she organized the Highway 10 refugee concerts in Zaatari which were attended by over 75,000 people.

She's become particularly well-known for commissioning contemporary work from, among others,

Jennifer Higdon, Caroline Shaw

Julia Wolfe and Hildur Gudnadóttir.

And she's made a point of programming their works alongside composers of the canon.

She's been quoted as saying

"These composers are having a conversation and it may not always be so polite."

Lydia Tár has also written music for the stage and screen.

She is in fact one of only 15 so-called EGOTs meaning those who have won all four major entertainment awards: an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony.

It is, as you can imagine an extremely short and shimmering list that includes Richard Rodgers,

Audrey Hepburn

Andrew Lloyd Webber and, of course, Mel Brooks.

In 2010, with the support of Eliot Kaplan she founded the Accordion Conducting Fellowship which fosters entrepreneurship and performance opportunities for female conductors allowing them residencies with major orchestras around the world.

In 2013, Berlin elected Tár as its principal conductor in succession to Andris Davis and she's remained there ever since.

Like her mentor, Leonard Bernstein

Tár has a particular affinity for Mahler whose nine symphonies she recorded during her Big Five stints.

However, she never managed to complete the so-called "cycle" with a single orchestra until now.

Under her direction,

Berlin has recorded eight of the Mahler symphonies saving the big one,

Symphony No. 5, for last.

Due to the pandemic that performance which was scheduled for last year had to be canceled.

But I'm told that next month she'll make a live recording of Mahler's Fifth which will complete the cycle and will be issued in a box set by Deutsche Grammophon just in time for Mahler's birthday.

As if that's not enough, her new book, Tár on Tár will be published by Nan Talese's imprint at Doubleday just in time for Christmas, a perfect stocking stuffer especially if you have a very large stocking.

All of us at The New Yorker welcome you.

Thank you for joining us, Maestro

- today.

- Thank you, Adam. Thank you.

Thank you.

Lydia, I couldn't...

I couldn't help but see you flinch just a little bit as I was reading your bio.

Was it because I forgot some other amazing achievement?

Or do you have a slight self-consciousness about the incredibly varied things that you've accomplished?

Well, in today's world,

"varied," it... it's a dirty word.

I mean, our era is one of specialists and if you're trying to do more than one thing it's, you know, it's often frowned upon.

Every artist gets typecast.

Oh, yes. Aggressively so.

Well, do you think there'll be a moment, though when the classical music community decides not to use sexual distinctions to differentiate artists?

I'm probably the wrong person to ask since I don't read reviews.

- Never, really?

- No.

But it is odd, I... I think, that anyone ever felt compelled to substitute "maestro" with "maestra."

I mean, we don't call women astronauts "astronettes."

Right.

But as to the question of gender bias

I really have nothing to complain about.

Nor, for that matter, should

Marin Alsop, JoAnn Falletta

Laurence Equilbey and Nathalie Stutzmann.

I mean, there's so many incredible women who came before us.

You know, women who did the... the real lifting.

That... that's fascinating.

Can you... Who, for instance?

Okay, sure.

First and foremost, Nadia Boulanger.

I mean, that would be the... happy example.

The sad one would be Antonia Brico who by all accounts was an incredible conductor but was ghettoized into the non-glamorous status of a "guest conductor" and essentially treated as a dog act.

A dog... She never got the chance to lead a major orchestra?

Well, yes. Yes, she did conduct the Berlin Philharmonic, as well as the Met but, again, only as a guest conductor.

You know, at, I mean, at that time it was... it was all gender spectacle.

But fortunately, times change and... and the Pauline conversion is...

- "Pauline..."

- if not complete then it's... it's evolving nicely.

N-No less having fallen off its horse.

Lydia, could we talk a little bit about translation?

'Cause I think there's still people who think of the conductor as a kind of human metronome.

Well, yeah, that's... that's partly true.

- Yeah, but it's...

- But keeping time it's... it's no small thing.

But I suspect there's a lot more to it than that.

Yeah, well,

I... I would hope so, yes.

But time is the thing.

Time is... is the essential piece of interpretation.

You cannot start without me.

See, I start the clock.

Now, my left hand shapes, but my right hand, the second hand marks time and moves it forward.

However, unlike a clock, sometimes my second hand stops which means that time stops.

Now, the illusion is that like you,

I'm responding to the orchestra

- in real time, making the decision

- Right, right.

About the right moment to restart the thing, or reset it or throw time out the window altogether.

The reality is that right from the very beginning

- I know precisely what time it is

- Really?

And the exact moment that you and I will arrive at our destination together.

You know, the only real discovery for me is in rehearsal.

It's never, never in performance.

Hard question, I know but if you could define one thing that Bernstein gave you what would it be?

Kavvanah.

Yeah, it's... it's the Hebrew word for attention to meaning or... or intent.

You know, what are the composer's priorities and what are yours, and how do they complement one another?

Right, kavvanah. I think that's a word that will have a slightly different meaning for many in our audience.

Well, yes, yes, I imagine so.

Am I right in thinking that a conductor was not always an onstage presence

- in classical music?

- No, that's right.

I... I think I read someplace that it actually was the first violin, for a long time

- who was responsible.

- Yes, the first violinist whether they had any interest or... or skill in it or not.

W-when did that change, and... and who changed it?

With the French composer,

Jean-Baptiste Lully who reportedly used a rather enormous rather pointy staff to pound the tempi into the floor.

It's not something I imagine the players particularly appreciated.

Anyway, that technique ended during a performance when Lully accidentally stabbed himself in the foot with the thing and died.

Yeah, of... of gangrene.

But anyway...

Yeah.

Anyway, but the conductor really becomes essential as the ensembles get bigger.

And once again, we go back to Beethoven.

Now, that doesn't start with the eighth note.

The downbeat... it's silent, right?

So someone had to start that clock.

Someone had to plant their flag in the sand and say, "Follow me," you know?

And when that someone was Lenny, the orchestra was led on the most extraordinary tour of pleasures.

'Cause he knew the music,

Mahler especially as well or better than anyone.

And he would often play with the form.

'Cause he wanted an orchestra to feel that they had never seen, let alone heard or... or performed any of that music.

So he... he would do radical things like disregarding the tempo primo or... or ending this phrase molto ritardando even though it had no such marking.

Was he over-egging it?

Oh, no, no, no. Not at all.

He... he celebrated the joy of his discovery.

You told us a moment ago that your discovery takes place in rehearsal.

When will that process begin again for you?

We start on Monday.

Immediately?

With this one, it really is about trying to read the tea leaves of... of Mahler's intention.

I mean, we know a great deal about this with his other symphonies.

You know, he was so inspired by the poetry of Rückert that for years he didn't set another author to music.

But all of this changes with the Five.

The Five is a mystery.

And the only clue he leaves us is on the cover of the manuscript itself.

Yes, the... the dedication to his new wife, Alma.

So if you're gonna partner with Mahler on his fifth symphony the first thing you must do is try to understand that very complex marriage.

And would you say that you have a different interpretation of that marriage than Bernstein did?

You mentioned my ethnographic fieldwork in the Amazon.

Well, Adam, the Shipibo-Konibo only receive an icaro, or song if the singer is there, right?

On the same side of the... the spirit that... that created it.

And in that way, the past and the present converge.

It's the flip sides of the same cosmic coin.

That definition of fidelity makes sense to me.

But Lenny, he believed in teshuvah.

The... the Talmudic power to reach back into time and... and transform the significance of one's past deeds.

So when he played the Adagietto at Robert Kennedy's funeral it ran for 12 minutes.

He treated it as a mass.

And, you know, if you listen to a recording of it you will no doubt feel the tragedy and... and the pathos.

And of course that interpretation was very true for Mahler later in life after the professional bottom dropped out and Alma had left him for Gropius.

But, as I said before, we are dealing with time.

And this piece was not born into aching tragedy.

It was born into young love.

And so you chose...

Love.

Right, but precisely how long?

Well... seven minutes.

I was so taken by what you said to Adam about interpretation and specifically about feelings, and that you chose love.

And I know it's said that you should leave the tears for the audience, but... do you ever find yourself overwhelmed by emotion when you're up there at the podium?

Yes.

Yes, that does happen.

There's an... an expectation-reward cycle with some works and the spots in them that I find so incredible, that when I'm conducting it's not that I'm rushing exactly but I just can't wait to get to that spot and, yeah, it does it.

It does it every time.

So it's physical as well as emotional.

God, it must take hours to come back down to earth.

You say things after others remember, but you won't.

And sleep, it's impossible.

It's like my freshman year at Smith.

Which piece does that to you?

Oh, I saw you.

I saw you conduct The Rite of Spring at the Met last year.

It was so powerful.

Thank you.

Thank you. It's...

It's the 11 pistol shots... it's a prime number... that strike you as both victim and perpetrator.

You know, it's not until

I conducted it that I became convinced we're all capable of murder.

That is a fantastic handbag, by the way.

Thank you. I'm glad you like it.

Oh, I do. I do.

Sorry. Your lunch with Mr. Kaplan.

His driver is waiting.

All right.

I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name.

- Whitney. Whitney Reese.

- Whitney.

Whitney, of course.

I'm... I'm so sorry and unfortunately

I've left things a bit late and there's something

I can't get out of.

I understand. Can I text you?

It's perfect, Aldo.

Oh. I was hoping we could celebrate.

No. So was I.

I've got a class at Juilliard.

Oh, good.

I promised Ben.

I'm sure you'll have a few elbowing for an Accordion slot.

We should open up the fellowship.

- What, expand our numbers?

- No, our sex.

I mean, it feels quaint to keep things single-gender.

We've made our point.

And, honestly, we've had no real trouble successfully placing any of them.

Except one.

Oh, well.

She had issues.

So I've heard.

The topic comes up in every Citibank meeting with her father.

I'm sorry about that.

It's fine.

It's nothing I can't handle.

So, you want to torpedo

Accordion's founding principle?

We'd likely lose donors.

Yeah, I suppose that's true.

M-Maybe it's something we revisit down the line.

Sure.

Now, Bryant Park's locked for the 25th.

Nan asked me to help fill the place so the Kaplan Fund is gonna buy some radio and outdoor advertising.

And claqueurs.

It's too big, Eliot.

She should have booked the Strand.

Relax.

It'll be great.

And it almost falls on your birthday.

I was... I was sorry you weren't able to make it to my Mahler Three in London.

Me, too.

Petra had a school thing.

And I promised Sharon I'd be there.

Of course.

I was just hoping for your honest opinion.

My player rating sheets were off the charts.

Those are confidential, Eliot.

Well, the principal oboist is a big fan.

On the way back, I was listening to yours with the Israeli Phil and I was struck by what you managed to pull from the strings in the last movement.

I mean, how did you get them there?

Was it the hall?

Was it the players?

The players weren't very obliging.

The principal violinist came up to me after the first rehearsal

- and asked if I was a Jew.

- What?

It seemed to him unusual, if not suspicious that a non-Jew would be interested in conducting Jewish music.

Felt like Max Bruch.

Well, big Jew that I am the Kaplan Fund has committed a sizable amount to them for a klezmer commission.

Maybe they'll invite me to guest conduct.

Oh, well, they'd be lucky to have you.

Oh, please.

I know my place.

Money can't always buy you everything.

You don't really believe that.

I'll have you know

I tried to bribe Francesca to let me look at your notation.

She sent me packing.

Good girl.

That gentleman sitting over there with the gnome is urgently focused on our table.

At first, I thought he was looking at me but I think he's got his eye on you.

Please try and ignore him.

I can excuse myself and go wash my hands if you'd like to be alone.

And I would never forgive you.

The last thing I need is to be buttonholed in here by someone exactly like me.

What time are you leaving tomorrow?

Francesca's looking into flights.

Well, call her off.

Leave when you like.

You don't have to do that.

My motives are not entirely altruistic.

Just one peek. One peek at your performing score.

Fine.

Would 5:15 be okay?

- Sure.

- Okay, I mean, I do...

I have to get turned around fast.

We're filling a vacant position.

Oh, please tell me it's Sebastian.

Now, be fair, Eliot.

Sebastian has decent technique.

He has baton.

A month ago, I dropped into Bunkamura to watch the touring machine trot out Chopin 1.

Ol' Sebastian really is

Mr. Tempo Rubato.

Robot-o is more like it.

Why do you keep him on?

Oh, he's Andris's man, you know that.

Exactly. You inherited that decision.

Seven years is a long time to pretend you respect it.

They have different labor contracts over there.

He's a... he's a strange guy.

Who? Andris?

No, Sebastian.

He has... fetishes.

Fetishes? Like what?

Nostalgia for pre-war

Kalmus miniature scores dead-stock pencils he's seen von Karajan hold in photographs.

You know, that sort of thing.

That's just sad.

Yeah, but you're not wrong.

I am gonna have to rotate him at some point.

For who?

What Love Teaches Me.

That string notation.

Mahler gives it to you himself.

{\an5}- Come on.

- Trust me.

You do not want to go to school on someone else's red and blue pencil.

Least of all, mine.

Oh, but I do.

All right.

Will you quit pestering me?

Yes.

Free bowing.

It's not pretty for an audience to look at but if you can manage to keep your players out of the weeds... the sound's ferocious.

There's no glory for a robot, Eliot.

Do your own thing.

All right...

Let's... stop here.

- Thank you, Max. Very good.

- Thanks.

Just for my own edification... why did you come to Juilliard?

It's the best music conservatory in the country?

People from Curtis, Eastman, and others may beg to differ.

I mean, Juilliard's a brand, right?

So, did you come to study with a brand?

- No.

- No, right.

So there's a teacher or graduate somewhere down the line who, you know, conjured something in your imagination.

Someone you aspire to be yourself.

So, who was that?

Sarah Chang.

So you're a violinist?

- Yeah.

- All right, okay.

Well, I can see why you would choose to conduct a piece like this.

Must be a familiar pleasure in presiding over a bed of strings that behave as if they're tuning.

Now... this piece is very au courant.

I mean, here, the composer tells us to begin with "back-and-forth tremolo strokes with wire brush and slowly sliding crotales over skin."

Sounds like René Redzepi's recipe for reindeer.

It's exciting to play new music, isn't it?

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

Great. All right, please, join the other fellows.

Now, I know you're all conducting students of Mr. Wolfe's but how many of you are also studying composition?

Right, what's your name?

Olive Kerr.

All right, Olive.

What do you make of what we've just been listening to?

It's pretty awesome.

I mean, there's incredible atonal tension.

I agree about the tension part.

Now, you can intellectually contemplate, or masturbate about the felicity of the so-called "atonal" but the important question here is: What are you conducting?

What is the effect?

What is it actually doing to me?

Good music can be as ornate as a cathedral or bare as a potting shed so long as it allows you to answer both those questions.

Max.

Come on, what do you think?

When... Anna Thorvaldsdóttir gave her master class she said she was often influenced by the form and structure of landscapes and nature she grew up within.

But I'm not sure she was interested per se in describing those actual sounds.

Very Punkt Kontra Punkt.

Yes.

The intent of her composition is vague, to say the least.

So, if her intent is vague how do you, as a conductor, have a point of view about anything?

Now, to be fair, I mean there are times when you will simply have no choice.

And you will be made to stand in front of an orchestra and pretend that there are these invisible structures.

But my prayer for you is that you will be spared the embarrassment of standing on the podium with a 4'33" trying to sell a car without an engine.

Because now, my friends, now is the time to conduct music that actually requires something of you.

You know, music that everybody knows but will hear differently when you interpret it for them.

For instance, Max, why not a Kyrie?

You know, like, something like Bach's Mass in B minor.

I'm not really into Bach.

You're not into Bach?

Oh, Max.

Have you read the Schweitzer book?

No.

Well, you should.

It's an important text.

Now, Antonia Brico thought so.

So much so that she shipped herself to Equatorial Africa and canoed up the Congo River to track Schweitzer down and ask him to teach her what he knew about Bach.

I mean, somewhere,

I've got a picture of her in a... in a pith helmet.

I mean, have you... have you ever played or... or conducted Bach?

Honestly, as a BIPOC, pangender person

I would say Bach's misogynistic life makes it kind of impossible for me to take his music seriously.

Come on.

What do... what do you... what do you mean by that?

Well, didn't he sire, like, 20 kids?

Yes, that's documented.

Along with a considerable amount of music.

But I'm sorry, I'm...

I'm unclear as to what his prodigious skills in the marital bed have to do with B minor.

Sure.

All right, whatever.

That's... that's your choice.

I mean, after all,

"a soul selects her own society."

But remember, the flip side of that selection closes the valves of one's attention.

Now, of course, siloing what is acceptable or not acceptable is a basic construct of many, if not most, symphony orchestras today who see it as their imperial right to curate for the cretins.

So, slippery as it is there is some merit in examining Max's allergy.

Can classical music written by a bunch of straight,

Austro-German, churchgoing white guys exalt us individually as... as well as collectively and who, may I ask, gets to decide that?

You know, what about Beethoven?

You into him?

Because for me, as a U-Haul lesbian

I'm... I'm not too sure about old Ludwig.

But then, I face him.

And I find myself nose-to-nose with his magnitude and inevitability.

Come on, Max. Indulge me.

Let's allow Bach a similar gaze.

Sit.

Now, this is all filigree, right?

I mean, it could be a first-year piano student.

Or Schroeder playing for Lucy

Or Glenn Gould, for that matter.

Now, it's not until it changes... you get inside it, that you hear what it really is.

It's a question.

And an answer.

Which begs another question.

There's a humility in Bach.

He's not pretending he's certain about anything.

'Cause he knows that it's always the question that involves the listener.

It's never the answer, right?

Now, the big question for you is: What do you think, Max?

You play really well.

But nowadays, white, male, cis composers, just not my thing.

Don't be so eager to be offended.

The narcissism of small differences leads to the most boring conformity.

I guess Edgard Varèse is okay.

I mean, I like "Arcana," anyway.

Oh, well, then you must be aware that Varèse once famously stated that jazz was "a Negro product exploited by the Jews."

Didn't stop Jerry Goldsmith from ripping him off for his Planet of the Apes score.

It's kind of a perfect insult, don't you think?

But you see, the problem with enrolling yourself as an ultrasonic epistemic dissident is that if Bach's talent can be reduced to his gender, birth country, religion, sexuality, and so on then so can yours.

Now, someday, Max, when you go out into the world and you guest conduct for a major or minor orchestra you may notice that the players have more than light bulbs and music on their stands.

They will also have been handed rating sheets the purpose of which is to rate you.

Now, what kind of criteria would you hope that they would use to do this?

Your score reading and stick technique, or something else?

All right, everyone, using Max's criteria let's consider Max's thing.

In this case, Anna Thorvaldsdóttir.

Now, can we agree on two pieces of observation?

One, that Anna was born in Iceland.

And two, that she is, in a, I don't know

Waldorf teacher kinda way, a superhot young woman.

Show of hands.

All right, now let's turn our gaze back to the piano bench up there and see if we can square how any of those things possibly relate to the person we see seated before us.

Oh, where are you going?

You're a fucking bitch.

And you are a robot.

I mean, unfortunately the architect of your soul appears to be social media.

You want to dance the mask, you must service the composer.

You gotta sublimate yourself, your ego, and, yes, your identity.

You must, in fact, stand in front of the public and God and obliterate yourself.

All right.

During the lockdown, you did something I thought remarkable.

You made music for free.

Anyone at all could stream

Berlin performances without ever paying a dime.

Well, that... that was a... it's a democratically made decision by the players.

And though I... I wish I could claim the idea was mine it really did spring from the heart of Sharon Goodnow.

Sharon is your partner.

You have a child together and she's also the concertmaster for Berlin. Does that ever...

- Yes, that's right.

- Complicate things for you?

Your work getting into your home or the other way ar...

Jake said he was certain you'd be happy with the drape of the seat.

I will be if I can keep the fat off until next month.

You never gain weight.

Your... your mother texted me.

She knows you're busy but is hoping to drop by.

Next trip.

What are you thinking for dinner?

No.

No, I'm... I'm gonna stay in and put this piano to good use.

I'm suspicious of the E natural in the cello line.

Doesn't it sound like warmed-over Charles Ives to you?

Not... not at all.

But don't worry, I'll call Houston.

They'll be flexible.

You must have some New Haven friends you want to see tonight?

No. Not really.

Should I stop by later for notes?

No, that won't be necessary.

Okay.

Oh, I... I almost forgot, but... this was left for you at the front desk.

By who?

They didn't say.

Wh-What, no card?

No.

Okay, just... just leave it over there.

Thanks.

Good night.

Night.

You're listening to

All Things Considered from NPR News.

All Things Considered

And you should, too.

And now, more from NPR.

Over the next few weeks, we'll be hearing poems from four finalists

for the National

Youth Poet Laureate Award.

When were you informed of this?

Just this morning.

Mr. Kaplan was very apologetic.

I was able to get us on the 7.00am you like, through Munich.

The connection's short, but special services are standing by.

Where are things with DG?

Please tell me they've finally woken up to see the wisdom of honest-to-God LPs for this release?

No movement there yet.

Have you looked at the email I drafted for you?

Sent it last night.

Well, just forward me their response.

What's your take on The New Yorker talk?

It went well, I thought.

Oh. You're hedging.

I was garrulous.

No.

No, not at all.

You... you were fabulous.

Francesca.

If you have any real interest in conducting you need to be able to speak your mind.

Okay. Perhaps you...

You could've made less of the relationship with...

Lenny?

No. I... I was thinking about Mahler and Alma's.

You implied that she betrayed him.

I'm not... I'm not sure

I agree with that.

Oh, really?

Alma was a composer, too but he insisted she stop writing music.

He said there was only room for...

- One asshole in the house?

- One asshole in the house. Yes.

And she agreed to those rules.

No one made that decision for her.





#RulesOfTheGame.

Okay.

How was your evening?

Yeah, uneventful.

Are there any of Sharon's pills left?

No, but Dr. Korovin called these in.

Thanks.

I received another weird email from Krista.

How should I reply?

Don't.

This one felt especially desperate.

Do you have some kind of profit-sharing deal with the utility company that I am unaware of?

The flutter's back.

It's... It's racing.

I can't find my Metoprolol anywhere.

Oh, fuck.

I found this lying loose in the drawer.

Is this the right one?

Yeah.

Thank you.

Is that a new bag?

Oh, it's just a gift from Eliot.

You want it?

No.

Suits you.

Let's slow this down to 60 beats a minute.

Actually, it's 64 beats.

Tried calling you on your mobile last night.

And again at the hotel.

Must've been asleep.

You never sleep that deeply.

No, no, don't be a scold.

Feelin' a feelin'

For somethin' there ain't too much of

I'm worried about Petra.

She's starting to disappear into herself.

Be specific.

She keeps coming home with bruises on her shins.

And then when I ask her about it, she gets quiet.

I mean, I hope it's just playground football and not some Biodeutsche thing.

We talked about this.

But maybe we just need to put more effort into finding her a friend.

Last year was really hard to be locked up alone with two old ladies like us.

She's old enough to learn piano.

I'll teach her.

Yeah.

That might be good.

How's your heart?

Better now.

Knock, knock. Who's there?

Lenny?

Walter?

Oh, it's you, MTT.

Why do you insist on holding things up like that?

Your business here is rejoicing not screaming like a fucking porn star.

Michael Tilson Thomas...

Hello, Petra.

Why are you lurking?

Tell me and I'll help.

Sharon?

I'm taking Petra to school.

Oh, okay.

- Come on.

- Tschüss.

Who'll bear the pall?

"We," said the wren,

"both the cock and

- the hen."

- The hen.

"I'll..."

"We'll bear the pall."

And who'll sing a psalm?

"I," said the thrush as she sat on a bush.

"I'll sing a song."

"Who'll toll the bell?"

"I," said the bull,

"because I can pull.

I'll toll the bell."

All the birds of the air fell a-sighing and a-sobbing when they heard the bell toll for poor Cock Robin!

It's gonna be okay.

All right. Okay, which one is she?

The red one.

- Bye.

- Go on.

Hallo, Johanna.

Hello. Hi.

They're all in the chamber hall?

Yes.

No.

Good morning.

Oh, I'm sorry, Maestro.

We weren't sure you were coming.

We were told there might be a scheduling conflict.

Would you like me to take notes?

No, thank you, Sebastian.

That won't be necessary.

Do we all have our rating sheets?

We narrowed it down to three.

So, unless anyone has other business to discuss let's bring in number one.

Goossens stands, sounds his A.

And of course, Léon was rather famous for his rather wide vibrato, huh?

Beecham looks up and says,

"Gentlemen, take your pick."

How's the writing going?

I never know how to answer that question.

No.

Makes it sound like a physical act.

Like, how's the shitting going?

Okay.

How's the thinking going?

Yeah, not so well.

I keep hearing something and getting excited only to catch myself in pastiche.

It's all pastiche.

We all have the same musical grammar.

Just look at Beethoven Five.

The third movement's theme has the same sequence of intervals as the opening theme of the final movement of Mozart Forty.

Th-that could've been a coincidence.

No. Not in this case.

If you examine the sketchbooks he used

29 bars of Mozart's finale appear.

Copied out by Beethoven.

Oh, my God. I find that extremely depressing.

I finished reading your manuscript.

It's very good, Lydia.

One for the ages.

And, I dare say, will be available long after my book has been forgotten.

Oh, yes, you're right.

The entire first printing will always be available.

Too modest, as usual.

Thank you, Andris.

I'll cherish this.

You may use it.

A... a blurb for the covers.

Oh, thank you.

I'll send it to the publisher.

Hopefully, there's still time.

I'm proud to call you my pupil even though there was really nothing I could teach you.

Now, that's not true.

I'd never have the position here were it not for you.

Then you'd be in London, New York.

They're not Berlin.

Besides, I'm not sure what Sharon would do were we ever to leave.

She's so close with her family.

Ah, yeah, the Goodnow sisters.

I remember the elder one being an absolute ball-breaker while she still held sway at DG.

Heike is a woman of many opinions.

And that voice.

I mean, the signal-to-noise ratio, it's unbearable.

I've had to bolt-hole at my old place in town to get any writing done.

Schopenhauer measured a man's intelligence against his sensitivity to noise.

Didn't he once also throw a woman down a flight of stairs who later sued him?

Yes.

Although, it's unclear this private and personal failing is at all relevant to his work.

You're late.

- Here, give me your stick.

- Thank you.

I've got it.

Okay.

(German)

(German)

Okay?

But it's also...

It's like we're hearing it from a very, very great distance.

So it's...

Sorry. Is Harald nearby?

(German)

Harald? I was just wondering if you might quickly rig something up for us?

Good, good, good.

(German) Harald?

(German)

We'll want the same backstage setup for the live recording.

One, two, one.

(German)

Okay? Looks great, but... we need to hear it. Okay? It's not...

Hey.

(German)

Okay?

(German)

No. (German)

It's... it's much too slow.

(German)

(German)

Okay.

Okay, tutti.

(German)

How are things feeling up here?

- Fine, yeah.

- Yeah, actually great but it's a shame we don't record this one direct-to-disk.

It's criminal, is more like it.

Will you shoot me the MP3s?

Yeah, sure, but don't you want WAV files?

No, just think what people will actually be streaming.

What about video?

Yes, yes. Stage left A camera.

- Okay.

- All right. Thanks, guys.

Okay. Bye. You're quite welcome.

(German)

- There?

- Yeah.

You want us to come...

- to come in stronger there?

- Okay, then yeah.

Here, 'cause the reigning dynamic is forte, which is not good.

- Yeah?

- Yeah.

Just one small thing, Maestro.

During the scherzo th-th-the clarinet solo's still a bit too loud.

It should really be an accompanying figure to the first violins.

But apart from that,

I'd say we're in very good shape.

Thank you, Sebastian.

Thank you.

Accurate assessment?

I don't think so.

The clarinet is marked piano, and we are marked pianissimo.

Sebastian likes to sit in the stalls but there's no problem with the balance in the circle.

Something a bit more playful.

Oh, and here's something

Tanya and I did with Gustavo.

I think it's very powerful.

Yes, it's... it's really wonderful work, Karl.

I'm just wondering if we might try something a little less considered.

Something simple like this?

I'm not sure how you would want to light it.

Have Harald dim the houselights to half.

Houselights down half, please.

I mean, we could make it work, but we'd have to bring in some lights.

If we want to do something like this we'll have to bring the hot lights next week, Tanya forget about the strobes.

Thank you for waiting.

Of course, Maestro.

How are we feeling about today's rehearsal?

Well, Sebastian thinks your solo in the scherzo is a bit loud.

It's possible.

I don't agree.

Your dynamic marking is higher than that of the first violin.

Yes, that's true.

Look. Sebastian's getting old, Knut.

I'm rotating him out.

You're the first to know.

Well... then I will organize a caucus, and we'll take a vote.

No. No, you won't.

A vote must be taken.

I am familiar with the electoral conclave.

But the appointment of the assistant conductor is entirely my decision.

Yes.

So, I can count on your support with the others?

Yes.

Good.

Who will you replace him with?

Oh. I'm considering a few names but the main thing is we proceed with this immediately.

I understand.

Maestro, the other players would like to know if you have chosen the companion piece.

Okay. Thanks.

- I...

- It's okay.

Thanks.

Changing major to minor

I'm sorry, I knocked.

I knew you wanted your keys back as quickly as possible.

Yes, thanks.

- Did you use the company card?

- Yeah.

We can use it for your... your taxi home.

Yeah. It's all right. You can go.

It wasn't just the keys.

I... I need someone to hold me.

This isn't the place, Francesca.

You're... That's not about...

I just...

I just got this from someone over at Accordion.

Oh, no.

When did this happen?

Day before yesterday.

That email she sent you, it felt like she was already...

Delete it. And the rest.

There's no reason to get caught up in any intrigue.

Now, now.

Come on. There's nothing we could have done to stop her.

She wasn't one of us.

I can't stop thinking about our trip up the Ucayali.

- The three of us were so close.

- Yes.

But that was before she started making demands.

No. There was just something not quite right about her.

She had so much promise.

She did.

Yes.

Almost as much as you.

Now, we have to forget about her.

You understand?

Right?

- I'm sorry.

- No.

I know you're working.

Your...

Your keys are on the kitchen table.

She went straight to sleep.

Didn't even have to hold her foot.

And she came home in a much better mood.

Oh, attagirl.

Met the new cellist today.

Oh, what was that like?

Olga Metkina.

Russian.

Strong player.

Good.

Her facial posture is a bit much.

How so?

Her legato. Looks like she's on the verge of climaxing.

She is young.

So you've met her.

No, no.

Francesca mentioned something.

I think she's arranging a welcome lunch.

You may want to hold off on that.

Her invitation is conditional.

You have reservations?

No.

Not really.

We need to see if she fits in.

Did you take your pill?

No.

Thank you for reminding me.

How was Johanna yesterday?

She stays away now.

Good. You let me know if that changes.

Petra, last night, you weren't, by any chance, in my study?

No, Lydia.

Because you do know you're not supposed to be in there without me.

I know.

That's right.

It's not so simple.

It's got... it's got to be messier.

Moment. It's...

(German)

Okay?

(German)

A lot of pressure. Okay?

Forget Visconti.

Okay? It's so familiar to everyone here.

It really doesn't help you to know this piece so well. Okay.

Same place.

Just a little crescendo... now let the third come through.

Please.

Please, please, please.

You must watch.

It's completely free here.

Okay?

It's got to be like just one person singing their heart out.

And... you're playing like an... exercise.

Okay.

Once again from the top of the Adagietto.

Okay.

Maestro.

What a surprise.

I was just having a spot of lunch.

C-Can I offer you anything?

No, thank you.

- Well, some tea, perhaps?

- No, thank you, Sebastian.

You know, I forget sometimes just how impressive your collection is here.

Is that Kalinnikov?

Yes.

Isn't he marvelous?

He belongs in a museum.

I rescued him for a hundred rubles from a Kyiv street fair back in '90.

Right after the Wall came down.

That must really have been something.

Oh, incredible to have lived through it.

I'd only just arrived here with Andris and suddenly the impossible was possible.

Yeah.

I'd like to talk about that.

- The reunification?

- No, no.

But please, sit down.

No, about the possibility of you fronting a subscription orchestra.

But I already do.

Yes, but not as Kapellmeister.

If not now, then when, Sebastian?

You mean leave Berlin?

Well, rotate somewhere, yes.

But this is my home.

Our only home is the podium.

We all live out of a suitcase.

You know that as well as anyone.

Just think about it.

Take your time.

It's not something we need to decide now.

It's the girl, isn't it?

I'm sorry, what girl?

You're not asking.

You're telling.

I knew as soon as she showed up that my days here were numbered.

Andris told me not to worry, but...

I knew.

I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.

Oh, please.

Just because nobody dares breathe it.

We know the things you do.

The little favors you grant.

I'm...

I really don't know what to say, Sebastian.

I mean, you of all people have the temerity

- to question my integrity?

- No, no.

I'm... I'm sorry, Maestro.

- I don't know what I'm saying.

- No, no, no, it's clear you know exactly what you're saying.

I mean, if that's how you really feel about me then wouldn't you say that staying is entirely out of the question?

No, no, please, Maestro.

Please forgive me.

For what?

Your obsequiousness, your hypocrisy, your misogamy?

I'm not a misogynist!

Misogamy.

It's a hatred of marriage.

Andris is still very much married.

And you occupy an apartment on the same floor, don't you?

I just don't like what he's implying.

It could lead to more than Chinese whispers.

I know.

We barely survived Der Spiegel when you and I came out together.

But with Francesca, no one could point their finger.

It's not like you two are in a relationship.

Yeah, that's true.

I just... Turns my stomach to think the old robot will be right about something.

He's probably already run to Andris.

Well is there someone other than Francesca you feel is more qualified?

There are others equal to the task.

Maybe wait to decide.

Where are we at with DG?

I spoke to an assistant in Boyd Muir's office who said they weren't sure why they decided on a digital-only set what the criteria were.

But I do know they just did a full-vinyl pressing for Long Yu.

Of course they did.

The Chinese market's incredible.

All right. Gloves off.

I'm going straight to Lucian.

Maybe he needs to be reminded of his Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.

You've got his contact details, right?

I'll send it to you right now.

My machine's misbehaving again.

I've already spoken to IT.

Just here... let me borrow yours.

Thank you.

Where's the matcha?

I wasn't sure where you were.

Was working out a kink.

The... the matcha's cold.

- I... I'll get another.

- It's all right. I don't need it.

Let's just keep working.

Francesca, you did as I asked and deleted any and all correspondence with Krista, correct?

I'm not sure.

I'm... I'm not sure.

I'll double-check.

You know, Sebastian's leaving us and I wondered if you might compile a list of suitable replacements.

Of course, feel free to add your own name.

Thank you.

Oh, your... your lunch with the new cellist.

Oh.

Meant to have you reschedule that

'til after the orchestra votes.

I'll text her now.

No, wait.

Might as well see what she's made of.

This food.

The cucumber salad's very good.

It's kind of the only real option in this place if you're vegetarian.

Do you eat fish?

Not really.

You know, we can go somewhere else.

L-Like the Store Kitchen.

I mean, it's... it's kind of a silly tradition really that new members are brought here to sup with the ghosts of the past.

I mean, at some point, everyone from... from Napoleon to Beethoven tucked in for a meal at one of these tables.

Yes, and Clara Zetkin.

I wonder which one.

Who's that? It's a musician?

No. She helped found

Social Democratic women's movement in Germany and KPD until Hitler came to power and she was exiled to Soviet Union.

- Clara Zetkin?

- Yes.

Every March 8th we place flowers at her plaque in Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

Her birthday?

No, International Women's Day.

Are you ready, Maestro?

- Yes...

- Yes, first shashlik, then veal.

For you?

- Cucumber salad. Thank you.

- Good choice.

Some more bread?

It's good. Would you like a bite?

Oh, no.

No. Thank you.

Have you lived in Berlin long?

No, not at all.

I have friends in Wicker I visit until I know decision of orchestra.

Simonov will hold your place?

Yes, I think so. He is my uncle.

Oh.

But my dream has always been to play with Berlin.

Oh, me, too.

There's nowhere like it.

I imagine Rostropovich is a hero of yours.

Well, of course, he was great.

We study him at Moscow Conservatory but growing up, my favorite is Jacqueline du Pré.

She made me want to play cello.

Which record was it?

Not record. YouTube.

Elgar Concerto.

Oh, of course.

With Barenboim conducting the London Phil.

I don't know who was conducting.

But she did something to me.

That's when I decide to learn piece and play it with youth orchestra.

Quite a challenge. How old were you?

Thirteen.

Wow.

I'd love to hear it.

They make video. I will text to you.

Beautiful.

Very nice indeed.

Let's leave it here.

Tomorrow we'll begin with the Rondo-Finale.

Now, just before we break

I know many of you are wondering what the companion piece will be.

And I have been thinking quite a bit about it and was wondering if we could just take an informal poll about possibly pairing the Five with Elgar's Cello Concerto.

Wonderful.

Elgar it is.

Oh, and... given what we've all been through what we're still going through and we're finally back together as a family, I... I...

I feel that maybe the soloist should come from within our own ranks.

Yeah.

Good.

Okay, good. Just... Sorry.

One more question.

And this really is just for you, Gosia.

I mean... as a practical matter, I mean, this would normally fall to you.

But given how much is gonna be asked of you with the Mahler

I... I wondered if you'd be at all bothered if we were to hold auditions?

Well, that's a bit unorthodox.

But, in theory, I have no objection.

My only hesitation will depend on when these auditions might take place.

I wouldn't want them in any way to interfere with our sectionals.

No, no. That's a good point.

I mean, it's gonna have to be a...

It's gonna have to be a sprint.

How about Monday?

All right.

Okay, good. Knut, would you assemble a quorum for Monday?

Let me see what she says.

Okay, I got... I gotta go.

Britta, hi.

Lydia.

Just caught the end.

What'd you think?

How's it... how's it sounding?

Oh, it's fantastic.

I can't wait until the live recording.

Yes, well.

I'll be happy when it's over.

It's always that way.

I know you're busy, and I don't want to add to your load but...

Andris Davis called.

Look, he's upset

I'm rotating Sebastian.

No... no.

Something else.

But you will please let Laura know as soon as you have chosen his replacement so she can prepare a press release.

Yeah, of course.

So what did he want?

To complain about the punctuality of a driver he seems to believe the board supplies him with.

Do you know anything about this?

Yes.

No, it's just... it's just something I pay for.

Then why does he believe it's the board?

Because he needs to believe that.

H-He needs to b... needs to believe he hasn't been forgotten, Britta.

The academy has von Karajan's name on it and there are love shrines to Abbado all over this place.

But the name of Davis, it's essentially nowhere to be seen.

All right.

Then perhaps Francesca could have a word with the driver.

Of course.

One other thing.

It's unpleasant.

Oh, is it?

Operational shortfall?

Must I take Mrs. Sewing out to drinks again?

No, no, no, nothing to do with the orchestra.

Do you remember an Accordion Academy fellow named Krista Taylor?

Yes. Why?

Apparently, she committed suicide.

Oh, God. Poor thing.

Her parents mu...

Wait, sorry, I'm...

I'm confused, Britta.

Why... why were you put in the position to deliver this terrible news?

Why didn't Accordion contact me directly?

It's delicate, Lydia.

Mr. Kaplan thought it might be best if you contacted a lawyer before speaking with anyone at Accordion.

Well, presumably, that anyone includes Eliot himself.

I'm... I'm sorry, why... why would I need to do that?

Apparently, some accusations have been made.

Accusations?

What kind of accusations?

He didn't say.

But they were brought to Accordion's counsel.

Mr. Kaplan said he's certain nothing will come of it but one can't be too careful.

I'm sorry about the hour.

It's Lydia Tár calling.

I need to speak to Mr. Singer immediately.

Yes.

Yes, it's urgent.

Tired?

Sleep's elusive.

I was the same before a recording date.

Lydia... are... are you absolutely certain about Sebastian?

Who will you replace him with?

Possibly Andrew Crust.

He's been assisting

Otto Tausk at the VSO.

Not the girl?

Andris... have you ever had an issue with a... a student or colleague where that person may have misinterpreted your...

- intention?

- Has someone been complaining

- about me?

- No, no, no, of course not.

Because at this point, they've missed their chance.

- I'm out of the game.

- Yes, yes, I know, I know.

Course you are.

Thank God I was never pulled from the podium like Jimmy Levine.

Or hunted like Charles Dutoit.

I take it you're asking for a reason.

Well, there's just been so much of this sort of thing in the news lately.

Well, nowadays, to be accused is the same as being guilty.

But I suppose that was also the case all those years ago with Furtwängler.

A bit with Karajan, too.

Who was the better conductor?

I never played under Furtwängler.

Yeah, when I first arrived here, the older members had... hushed opinions.

At the same time, they wanted to leave that era behind.

- What, the war?

- No, postwar.

Denazification.

Someone pointed a finger at you, process started all over again.

Furtwängler never joined the Party.

Refused to give the salute or to conduct the Horst Wessel Lied.

Or to sign his letters,

"Heil, Hitler."

Even those he wrote to Hitler.

But he was obliged to be denazified.

Until then, he was semi-retired playing corpses.

Playing corpses?

Secretly performing in a graveyard.

You're not equating sexual impropriety with being an accused Nazi?

Either way, you had to be ready.

For years, I made sure all the hangers in my closet were facing the same direction.

How many are auditioning on Monday?

No one.

No one?

Maybe Martin.

He's never gotten along with Gosia.

He would love to sit downstage for once.

Well... he's still gonna have to audition.

Of course.

Have to follow the rules.

Aren't we being a bit formal, Francesca?

From what I understand, there's only one player, right?

No, Maestro, there are two.

Well, it's unanimous.

Number two.

And we have a problem.

She's not officially been invited to become a member of the orchestra.

Well, she wouldn't need to be to solo for us.

I believe the criteria of the audition was all section members?

- Then her audition gets thrown out.

- No.

Francesca, please ask Martin to come back in so we can give him the news.

Wait. Gosia, let's talk.

Shit!

Yeah!

I'll confirm solo rehearsal dates with her.

Thank you.

Have a seat.

I have made a decision regarding Sebastian's replacement.

And I want you to know it wasn't an easy one.

This position brings with it enormous responsibility and my personal affection for you aside...

I will have to go with someone more, more experienced.

Oh, leave me alone.

I don't have your paper.

I've told you before, I...

Oh, I'm sorry. Please come in.

Good. Good.

I... I think the contrast is, it's much better now.

Don't you think?

How do you take your coffee?

Black. Strong.

Is all right if I play?

Oh, yes, of course, of course.

That's as far as I've gotten.

But it's good.

This part here.

Maybe change A to B-flat?

That's better. I like that sound.

Come on. Take a break.

Okay.

Sharon?

Hello.

Petra.

What are you doing in here?

I'm hiding from her.

Why?

Because she told me to put my things in order but they already are.

I can see that.

Come on.

They're all waiting for you.

I'm going to give everyone a pencil.

All of them?

They can't all conduct, honey.

It's not a... it's not a democracy.

Okay.

Very nice. We'll go back to the Allegro Molto after the break.

(German)

Hey, that's good. You happy?

How long were you acquainted with Miss Taylor?

Oh, I'd have to double-check with my assistant but cumulatively speaking, I'd say not more than a few months.

Thank you for your time

- Maestro.

- Not at all.

This recording will exist on a protected server under attorney-client privilege with Mr. Singer.

- Great.

- He will follow up with you to help prepare for the deposition.

Deposition?

Yes.

I assumed you were aware.

Mr. Singer's office said they'd been coordinating with your assistant.

Francesca, you'd better get your pretty little ass to work right now.

The only communication we've received from Francesca was an email to my assistant in the middle of the night tendering her immediate resignation stating she would be in contact when she had more details to provide.

What kind of details?

A new address, I suppose.

In the meantime, we've been trying all morning to find someone suitable to assist you on a temporary basis.

For now, perhaps your new assistant conductor would be the right fit.

No. No. He's not available

'til after the live Five date.

Yes, I'm ready. Let's go.

I know how much you depended on her.

Two-faced little bitch.

Imagine her hurt, Tár.

- Don't you dare try to defend her.

- God, slow down!

She'll come galumphing back.

I mean, I've got a dumb phone

- like every robot. How hard

- Tár, s... can it be to text all day?

Slow down!

Or let me out!

Francesca!

Fräulein?

(German)

Come.

(German)

Sorry I'm late again.

Do you live here?

Not normally, no.

Make yourself at home.

I'm just gonna put something on.

Do you have a towel?

- Yes.

- Thank you.

I got caught in the rain.

There is small concert with musician friends.

You should come.

Thanks, but I... really must get home.

You have child, yes?

I will not do that.

Pets are better for some people.

What... Oh.

- Sorry.

- Bye.

Oh, yes. Goodbye. Yes.

- Goodbye.

- Okay.

- Oh.

- Okay.

Oh, Olga!

Olga!

Olga?

Olga?

Hello?

Olga?

Olga?

Olga?

Why didn't you go to the police?

I fought. He ran. What's to tell?

Oh, God. I'm gonna get you something for the pain.

- No, I don't need anything.

- No, I'm gonna get you something.

Ja.

Lydia!

Lydia!

What is it?

Hold my foot.

Is that better?

Yes.

Okay.

Let's shoo the elephant from the room.

"What the hell happened to her face?"

"Did she schedule a nose and eye job and bail before the surgeon finished the other half?"

No.

I was... I was attacked.

Thank you.

I'm fine. Really.

Should've seen the other guy.

All right.

Second movement, let's take the transition Bar 406.

Don't. It burns.

You must see the doctor.

He's booked 'til next week.

I'll call them again and tell them

- how much pain you're in.

- No, no, let's just... let's just finish up here.

Okay?

Overall, the balance feels right.

Other than a quick brush-up, we should concentrate on the Elgar.

You're certain of that?

I think so. Yes.

We're absolutely rock-solid there but I am going to try to hold them back here.

They're just getting caught up in the power of your glissando in there trying to match it.

Probably...

Where were you attacked, Maestro?

Oh, doesn't matter.

Here.

Thank you.

There you are.

When did this fall happen?

It's all a blur.

Three, four days ago.

It's just my shoulder.

Yeah. It kind of burns, like I fell asleep by the pool.

Okay, you can put your shirt back on.

You've damaged some nerves.

The burning sensation you're feeling is called notalgia paresthetica.

Nostalgia?

"Notalgia." No "S."

Well, how do we treat it?

You don't. Eventually, it goes away.

An adjustment might help.

You're somewhat crooked.

Oh, well, then you must be

a Negro product exploited by the Jews.

Now let's turn our gaze back to the piano bench up there

to a superhot young woman.

That's... that's... that was very good.

Now, you could masturbate

but what are you actually doing to me?

- Britta.

- Hi, hi.

Have you seen it?

Yes, yes. I've just seen it.

It's gathering this afternoon.

- This afternoon?

- Is that a problem?

No, just... No, it's no problem.

First of all, that class was conducted in a tech-free zone.

And second, whoever violated that rule edited what we've all seen to create linguistic traps to completely redefine my words.

I mean, look at the reverse shots on the students.

There's no way that was done in real time. It's a hatchet job.

I'm sure that's true, Lydia.

And were it just this video, we would not be sitting here.

Unfortunately, it's linked to an article in the New York Post regarding Krista Taylor's suicide which alludes to other Accordion fellows they claim to have interviewed.

Laura, can you tell us about your conversations?

We haven't had any.

Obviously, we gave no response as we first wanted to meet to discuss strategy.

- Here's the article.

- Thank you, Laura.

"Enticed and groomed multiple young women

"to engage in sex acts for professional favors.

Blocked opportunities to those who didn't comply."

This is total fiction.

And the Post is a how-de-do scandal rag.

No serious person reads it.

And so far as Krista Taylor goes she was disturbed.

I mean, she fixated on me.

In what way?

She sent me weird gifts.

She trolled me online.

She tried to send me signals.

Well, what kind of signals?

She vandalized my Wikipedia page to say she was my muse.

I mean, that's easily checked, right?

And did you ever report this or file a complaint?

No.

No. And I... Look, I probably...

I probably should have.

I... I felt sorry for her.

Is this something you shared with Sharon?

No. I didn't want to burden her with it.

- Don't you think you should have?

- Yes. Yes.

Well, what... what do you advise?

Well, for now, it hasn't gotten all that much traction.

None of the trades have linked to it or called for comment.

So I say let's see what happens.

We wanted to give you as much warning as possible, Lydia before this Friday's donor meeting.

Well, unfortunately,

I won't be there.

Well, I very much advise that you are.

I have the book launch in New York and apparently a deposition.

Well, we'll fill you in upon your return, then.

Enjoy your weekend.

Starving.

Finished my thing today.

Congratulations.

We should go out and celebrate.

I can't. I gotta pack.

Hi!

Sharon?

Yeah?

You seen my performance score?

No.

Why? Isn't it with the other ones?

No. No, it's not.

Are you sure it's not in my office?

Yeah, what about the orchestra library?

Yeah, can you check again, please?

I don't know. Yes, exactly.

Lydia?

Yes?

When will you be back?

The day after tomorrow.

Will you promise?

Yes, I promise.

- Good night.

- Good night.

Thanks. Do you have any bottles?

Of course.

Do you need anything else before I close the cabin door?

Yes. We're waiting on one more.

To all my questions pertaining to your communications with Krista Taylor and others your answers have always been

"I don't know" or "I don't remember."

Is there anything I could show you that might help refresh your recollection?

Any documents, such as emails from you or your personal assistant, Miss Lentini that might help you recall what you did and didn't say?

I guess you heard by now.

Bryant Park bumped you to 53rd Street.

This is the Kaplan Fund's prepared statement.

I'm sorry to say this is likely the last time we'll see each other.

Well, now I can buy my own plane tickets.

And you can bother someone else to try and teach you to crawl to the podium.

Is there a back entrance?

"Indeed, the common metaphors used to explain music

"are based on the idea that music is a language, albeit a secret one.

"And in this way, holy and unknowable.

"These joyful noises we make being the closest thing

"any of us might ever experience to the divine...

"yet something born by the mere act of moving air.

No different than birdsong."

So, meet downstairs in half an hour for dinner?

Thank you, but I am jet-lagged.

I go to sleep now.

Yeah, me, too. I'll... probably do the same.

Yes, hello.

Yes, there's no water in my room.

Yes, I've checked the minibar.

How long would it take to get a bottle of water?

Don't worry. I'll just come down.

Lobby, please.

Oh, Jesus.

It was Britta.

Right?

I mean, that is how you heard about these millennial robots trading in lies.

I couldn't care less about the Juilliard thing.

Too much time on her hands.

She's fringe.

The worst kind.

Every time I walk out of this house she's in your ear with intrigue or she's asking me about some other piece of fringe, like Samantha Hankey.

God, a nobody who has nothing better to do than drop my name at lunch and imply things.

I feel sorry for you.

Save it.

I tried calling you last night.

Did you have fun with her?

My back is killing me.

Francesca left, and I simply needed someone to carry my bags.

I mean, who was I supposed to ask?

To go with me? Knut?

Jesus fucking...

There are many things

I accept about you.

And in the end, I'm sure I could get over something like this.

But that's not what we're talking about, is it?

These accusations from the parents of the girl who suicided?

You honestly believe what they're saying?

They're lies.

Do you understand what it was like to walk into my sectional yesterday and to see everybody whispering about me?

It's got nothing to do with what they're accusing you of.

It's a simple matter of not warning me that our family is in danger.

And what good would that have done?

I mean, what could you possibly do to make things better?

Because I deserve that.

Those are the rules.

You are to ask for my fucking counsel the way you always have.

The way you did when you first arrived here as a guest conductor looking for a permanent position.

You asked me what were the politics what were the moves, how could we swing it.

Of course... these conversations took place in another bed.

Or rather, the couch of that horrible place

- you still can't let go of.

- Old sorrow blows in.

How cruel of you to define our relationship as transactional.

There's only one relationship you've ever had that wasn't.

And she is sleeping in the room next door.

Apparently, this hasn't even crossed your mind.

Petra!

Come here, darling.

- It was good.

- Was it?

- Yeah.

- You want to go to the park?

Don't do this. Please don't do this.

Please don't.

Hello. I am Anna Franzen.

This is my late mother's apartment.

Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry about your mother.

Thank you.

How's your sister doing?

Eleanor lives now in a facility in Neukölln.

I'm sorry to trouble you but my husband and I are selling the place and couldn't help hearing the music.

Oh.

I'm glad you enjoyed it.

We were wondering if there are specific hours you rehearse so we can schedule showings around them.

We don't want to scare potential buyers off with all the noise.

Oh, no.

No.

No, we wouldn't want that.

Apartment for sale

Apartment for sale

Your mother's buried deep

And now you're gonna keep

Her apartment for sale

Your sister's in jail

You put your sister in jail

You're all going to hell

Your apartment's for sale

Okay.

(German)

Give me some eyes.

Come on, give me some eyes!

Lydia.

This is my score.

Lydia, you're confused.

It's my score!

You fucking little nothing!

I'm fine.

You sign CAMI voucher.

Normally, I'd think Lisa Rich in our booking department would be a great fit for you but she's just got too much on her plate.

So, I'd like to team you with Jake here.

Jake, you want to... you want to show Lydia what you've prepared for her?

Well... right now it's a reset.

What we're after is less, not more.

We want to be selective and rebuild this from the ground up.

That means we need a new story.

Just here.

Here. Thank you.

Make it 40.

Thank you.

Didn't you feel triumphant?

Now we can really understand what the meaning of music is.

It's the way it makes you feel when you hear it.

Finally, we've taken that last giant step.

And we're there.

We know what music means now.

And we don't have to know a lot of stuff about sharps

and flats and chords and all that business

in order to understand music if it tells us something.

And the most wonderful thing of all is that there's no limit

to the different kinds of feelings music can make you have.

And some of those feelings are so special and so deep

that they can't even be described in words.

You see, we can't always name the things we feel.

Sometimes we can.

We can say we feel joy

pleasure, peacefulness, whatever, love, hate.

But every once in a while

we have feelings that are so deep and so special

that we have no words for them.

And that's where music is so marvelous

because music names them for us, only in notes instead of in words.

It's all in the way music moves.

You must never forget that music is movement

always going somewhere, shifting and changing

and flowing from one note to another.

And that movement can tell us

more about the way we feel than a million words can.

And here we're going to play you a...

Tony.

Oh.

Hi, Linda.

Sorry.

Lydia.

Ma said you'd be over.

You must be hiding out.

Why would I be hiding out?

Beats the hell out of me.

None of my business anyhow.

Lot of loose ends, you got to admit.

What do you mean?

Well, like I said, it ain't my business.

But you don't seem to know where the hell you came from or where you're going.

May I come inside?

Thank you.

I'm so sorry.

We just wanted to confirm that the composer was in fact not flying in from Osaka to attend the concert.

I... I must tell you that

I... I looked in the music libraries for her score, but I... I couldn't find anything.

This just arrived.

That's great. Thank you.

Shirley and Cirio will be most happy to show you the sights

- of our beautiful country.

- Thank you.

Thank you so much.

Oh, goodness.

Thank... thank you.

Maybe we could stop somewhere and take a swim.

Yeah, at the waterfall.

But not in the river.

Why? Is there something wrong with the water?

No. There are crocodiles.

Oh.

I didn't think they'd be this far inland.

They escaped from

Marlon Brando movie.

Wow.

That was a long time ago.

They survive.

Lady. Lady.

Here is prescription.

- Ten dollars.

- Oh. Thank you.

Is there somewhere around here... Thank you.

Where I could get a massage?

Was hoping it might help me with this jet lag.

Yes.

There is the very nice place I know.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Please step over to the fishbowl.

The... the fishbowl?

Yes, over there.

I'm sorry, I'm confused.

H-How does this... how does it work?

You just pick a number here.

I pick a number?

Yes.

Number five?

Good morning.

Good morning.

Now, before we begin, let's... let's talk a bit about the composer's intent with this piece.

And what she might be after.

Five minutes.

Thank you.

Sisters and brothers of the Fifth Fleet, it's time.

I'll keep my farewell brief.

Never was much with words.

Once you board this ship, there's no turning back.

The next ground your feet touch will be that of the New World.

If any of you have lost your nerve

then step away now and let no one judge you.





# The Banshees Of Inisherin (2022)

Colm?

Are you coming out to the pub, Colm?

It's 2:00, like.

Will I see you down there, so?

I'll see you down there, so.

What are you doin' home?

Brother?

What are you doin' home?

I knocked on ColmSonnyLarry.

He's just sitting there.

Sitting there doin' what?

Sittin' there doin' nothing.

Smoking.

Was he asleep?

He was smoking, Siobhan.

How do you smoke in your sleep, like?

Have ye been rowing?

We haven't been rowin'.

I don't think we've been rowin'.

Have we been rowin'?

Why wouldn't he answer the door to me?

Maybe he just doesn't like you no more.

Pint, Jonjo.

Is Colm not with you?

No.Colm's always with you.

I know.Did you not knock for him?

I did knock for him.

Well, where is he? Just sittin' there.

Sittin' there doin' what?

Sittin' there doing nothin'.

Smokin'.

Have ye been rowin'?

I don't think we've been rowin'.

Sounds like ye've been rowin'.

It does sound like we've been rowin'.

Will I try him again?

That'd be the best thing.

Officer Kearney.

Never says "hello."

Never fecking says "hello."

Colm?

Colm?

The door was open, Colm.

Colm?

Where the hell are you headin' off to?

Everybody?JONJO: No, this is true.

He scored six points from open play.

He was barely the size of a dwarf!

This is true!

Howdo. MAN: Howdo, Padraic.

Sit somewhere else.

Huh?

Uh... But I have me pint there, Colm.

He has his pint there, Colm, from when he came in and ordered his pint from before.

Okay.

I'll sit somewhere else, so.

Are ye rowin'?

I didn't think we were rowin'.

Well, ye are rowin'.

Well, ye are rowin'.

He's sittin' outside on his own like a whatchamacallit.

It does look like we're rowin'.

Well, I suppose

I'd best go talk to him, so.

See what all this is fecking about.

That'd be the best thing.

Now I'm sittin' here next to you, and if you're goin' back inside,

I'm followin' you inside, and if you're goin' home,

I'm followin' you there, too.

Now, if I've done somethin' to ya, just tell me what I've done to ya.

And if I've said somethin' to ya, maybe I said somethin' when

I was drunk, and I've forgotten it, but I don't think I said somethin' when

I was drunk, and I've forgotten it.

But if I did, then tell me what it was, and I'll say sorry for that too, Colm.

With all me heart, I'll say sorry.

Just stop running away from me like some fool of a moody schoolchild.

But you didn't say anything to me.

And you didn't do anything to me.

That's what I was thinking, like.

I just don't like you no more.

You do like me.

I don't.

But you liked me yesterday.

Oh, did I, yeah?

I thought you did.

Padraic.

Dominic.

What's the matter with ya?

There's nothing the matter with me, for God's sake.

Look at this I found.

A stick with a hook.

What would you use it for, I wonder?

To hook things that were the length of a stick away?

Where you goin'?

Down here.

As good a plan as any!

Have you any fags?No.

Uh, you do.

You always have fags.

ColmSonnyLarry's at Jonjo's handing out a rake of fags.

Whoever's in the mood for one.

Is he?No!

You're behavin' awful unusual.

What are you doin' here?

Was the pub closed?

No, it was open.

Anything in the paper?

Just the Civil War still.Ugh.

A bad do.

Mrs. McCormick's comin' over later, Padraic.

I couldn't avoid her.

I don't know if you're gonna be in or out, but you're usually out.

Am I?

You are.

Yeah, you know you are.

I don't care, Siobhan.

This is your house, too.

Is it six years since your mammy and daddy died, Siobhan, or is it seven years since they died?

It's coming up to eight years,

Mrs. McCormick, aye.

Is it comin' up to eight years?

Doesn't time be flyin'?

Aye, when you're havin' fun.

Oh, be off to the pub now, Padraic, if you're gonna be annoyin' us.

I don't have to be down there every night, do I?

ColmSonnyLarry's scared him off, I suppose.

What did you hear of ColmSonnyLarry?

Didn't you and he used to be the best of friends?

We're still the best of friends.

No, you're not. Who says we're not?

She says.

Ah, for God's sake, Siobhan.

I said nothing of the like,

Mrs. McCormick! I was just chatting.

Now, you go off to Jonjo's, Padraic, and don't be getting under our feet.

Sure, Mrs. McCormick never gets a chance to come over for a chat.

She never gets a chance 'cause you avoid her.

I do not avoid her!

You hide behind walls if she's coming up the road.

I do not! h... hide behind walls.

Good luck to ye.

Whatever it is you're fightin' about.

I didn't hear there was to be a session.

Last-minute thing.

Colm decided.

All the ladies love Colm, you know. Always did.

Yeah? That's not true.

You're still barred,

Dominic! Out!

You said barred until April.

What are we now?

April.

Well, put that stick outside anyways, and don't be bothering the women.

There's women?

There is women.

And good ones.

If we sat next to Colm, the women would have to talk to us too, and then we could get at them with our small talk.

I'm happy enough sittin' here, now.

Are ya, yeah?

Are ya happy enough, yeah?

I can't stand the maudlin' ones.

Play somethin' dancey, Colm!

To dance to.

And not have that mope whining.

Here, amn't I in enough trouble with him without your mouthing?

What trouble in are you in with him?

Uh, he just... doesn't want to be friends with me no more.

What is he, 12?

Why does he not want to be friends with you no more?

Shh.

Daddy'll kill us if we wake him when he's been wanking.

You won't get into trouble for taking his poteen?

I will get into trouble, but fuck it.

I saw cannon-fire and rifle-fire on the mainland tonight.

Did you see it?

That'll be the Civil War.

I know that, sure.

Me, I pay no attention to wars. I'm agin 'em.

Wars and soap.

I tell you this much.

We're good at chatting, aren't we?

Me and you?

Your sister, does she like to chat?

Not as much as most women, but she'll chat, like.

She more likes reading.

Reading?

Feckin' hell.

Reading.

And did you ever see her with no clothes on?

I didn't.

Did you not, and you her brother?

Not even as a child?

I don't like to be chattin' about these types of things, Dominic!

What types of things?

Sisters with no clothes on!

You saw my daddy with no clothes on.

And till the day I die,

I'll wish I hadn't.

Sure, don't I know it.

The tiny, brown cock on him.

What's the matter with him?

Maybe bad news he's had?

Daddy?

No, ColmSonnyLarry.

Didn't I tell ya I'd be off if you went whining about that lummox one more time?

I tell ya, it didn't look like he had bad news tonight.

It looked like a weight was lifted from his shoulders tonight.

Just bringing me cows past.

What?

I was just bringing me cows past.

I wasn't, you know, trying to...

You don't usually bring them this way.

I don't, but then the little fella took a fright at a hen on the corner, so...

I only...

I only just saw what month we changed to yesterday.

More fool me?

Changed to April.

So, will I be callin' for ya on me way to the pub later?

I will so.

Anyways,

I better chase after these goons for they're gettin' away from me.

Maybe they don't like me no more neither.

See you at 2:00, so, Colm.

Why don't you come down for a sherry later?

There's no need to be stuck inside on a nice day.

I will so.

How's the book?

It's sad.

Sad?

Well, you should read a not sad one, Siobhan, else you might get sad.

Hmm.

Do you never get lonely, Padraic?

Never get what?

Lonely.

Do I never get lonely?

What's the matter with everybody?

Jesus.

"Lonely." Fecking hell.

Colm?

Pint, Jonjo.

How's he seem?

Grand, I think.

With me, anyways.

What are you doing?

Oh, so you're gonna be an eejit again today, is it?

Amn't I allowed to have a quiet pint on me own, Padraic?

Well, don't ask a man to call up to ya at your fecking house, so, like he has nothing better to do with his fecking time.

I didn't ask you to call up to me at me house.

And you do have nothing better to do with your fecking time.

Huh?

You do have nothing better to do with your fecking time.

I know I've nothing better to do with me fecking time, but there's better things I could be doing with me fecking time than to be calling up to ya at your house, Colm Doherty!

Like what?

Huh?

Like what else could you be doin'?

Reading.

Reading, yeah?

Me, this morning... this I wrote.

Tomorrow, I'll write the second part of it.

And the day after, I'll write the third part of it.

And by Wednesday, there'll be a new tune in the world, which wouldn't have been there if I'd spent the week listening to your bollocks,

Padraic Suilleabhain.

So, do you want to take your pint outside, or do you want me to take my pint outside?

I'll take my pint outside,

'cause it's a shite tune anyways,

I wouldn't bother with it.

I was too harsh yesterday.

Yesterday, he says.

I know well you was too harsh yesterday.

And today.

I just, uh...

I just have this tremendous sense of time slippin' away on me, Padraic.

And I think I need to spend the time I have left thinking and composing.

Just trying not to listen to any more of the dull things that you have to say for yourself.

But I'm sorry about it.

I am, like.

Are you dying?

No, I'm not dying.

But then you've loads of time.

For chatting?

Aye.For aimless chatting?

Not for aimless chatting.

For good, normal chatting.

So, we'll keep aimlessly chatting and me life'll keep dwindling.

And in 12 years, I'll die with nothin' to show for it bar the chats I've had with a limited man, is that it?

I said, "Not aimless chatting."

I said, "Good, normal chatting."

The other night, two hours you spent talking to me about the things you found in your little donkey's shite that day.

Two hours, Padraic.

I timed it.

Well, it wasn't me little donkey's shite, was it?

It was me pony's shite, which shows how much you were listenin'.

None of it helps me, do you understand?

None of it helps me.

We'll just chat about somethin' else then.

What's the matter with ya?

Nothin'.

Aren't we going for a sherry?

Don't feel like it.

No, I'm not having this again today!

Hey! What the hell's going on with you and me fecking brother?

Don't come in here shouting the odds at me in the middle of the fecking day, all right, Siobhan?

You can't just all of a sudden stop being friends with a fella!

Why can't I?

Why can't ya?

Because it isn't nice.

Do you want a sherry, Siobhan?

No!Righty-ho.

Has he said somethin' to ya when he was drunk?

No, I prefer him when he's drunk.

It's all the rest of the time

I have the problem with.

What's the fecking matter, then?

He's dull, Siobhan.

He's what?

He's dull.

But he's always been dull.

What's changed?

I've changed.

I just don't have a place for dullness in me life anymore.

But you live on an island off the coast of Ireland, Colm.

What the hell are you hoping for, like?

For a bit of peace, Siobhan.

That's all.

For a bit of peace in me heart, like.

You can understand that.

Can't ya?

Can't ya?

Do you think I'm dull?

No. 'Cause you're not dull, you're nice.

That's what I thought.

I mean, I'm a happy lad.

Or I was.

Till me best friend started acting the gilly-gooly.

It's him, Padraic.

Maybe he's just depressed.

That's what I was thinking, that he's depressed.

Well, if he is, he could at least keep it to himself, like.

You know, push it down, like the rest of us.

- No, Jenny!

- Out!

Out!

She just wants a bit of company, Siobhan.

Animals is for outside,

I've told ya.

And people don't be laughing at me behind me back, do they?

No. Why would they be?

They don't think I'm dim or anything?

Dim?

No.

You don't seem very sure about it.

Of course, I'm sure about it.

Dominic's the dim one on the island, isn't he?

He is, aye. By miles.

Uh, hang on, by miles.

And then, who's the next dimmest?

Well, I don't like to judge people in those terms now, do I?

In what terms?In order of their dimness.

Well, I know you don't.

And neither do I, do I?

But try, like.No!

I won't try.

There's enough judgy people on this fecking island, so no!

You're not dim!

You're a nice man, all right?

So, move on!

I'm as clever as you, anyways.

I know that at least.

Yeah, don't be fecking stupid.

Huh?

What happened to you?

Me daddy discovered the poteen situation.

Oh, Jesus, Dominic!

You poor thing, ya.

What the hell was he hittin' you with?

A kettle was the final thing.

I wouldn'ta minded, but for the spout.

Do you want a ride to church?

Uh, feck them gobshites!

Dominic!

But could I stay the night with ye the night?

Just for the one night, like?

Mm...

Well, just the one night, mind.

Nice! I'll see ye for supper, so.

Whoo-hoo!

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

It's eight weeks since my last confession,

I think.

Go on, Colm.

Just the usual, I suppose, Father.

The drinking and the impure thoughts.

And a bit of pride, I suppose.

Although I never really saw that as a sin, but sure I'm here now.

And how's the despair?

Not so much of it of late.

Thanks be.

And why aren't you talking to

Padraic Suilleabhain no more?

That wouldn't be a sin, now, would it, Father?

It wouldn't be a sin, no, but it's not very nice either, is it?

Who told you?

It's an island, Colm.

Word gets around.

Also, Padraic asked me to put in a word, like.

I see.

So...

It isn't him you have the impure thoughts about, is it?

Are you joking me?

I mean, are you fecking joking me?

People do have impure thoughts about men, too.

Do you have impure thoughts about men, Father?

I do not have impure thoughts about men.

And how dare you say that about a man of the cloth?

Well, you started it.

Well, you can get out of my confessional right now, so you can.

And I'm not forgiving you any of these things until the next time, so I'm not!

Well, I better not be dying in the meantime then, eh, Father?

I'll be pure fucked!

You will be pure fucked!

Yes, you will be pure fucked!

Pint, Colm?

If you don't stop talkin' to me, and if you don't stop botherin' me, or sendin' your sister or your priest to bother me...

I didn't send me sister to bother you, did I?

She has her own mind.

Although, I did send the priest though, you have me there.

What I've decided to do is this.

I have a set of shears at home.

And each time you bother me from this day on,

I'll take those shears and I'll take one of me fingers off with them.

And I'll give that finger to ya.

A finger from me left hand.

Me fiddle hand.

And each day you bother me more, another I'll take off and I'll give ya until you see sense enough to stop.

Or until I have no fingers left.

Does this make things clearer to ya?

Not really, no.

Because I don't want to hurt your feelings, Padraic.

I don't, like.

But it feels like the drastic is the only option left open to me.

You've loads of options left open to ya.

How's fingers the first port of call?

Please, don't talk to me no more, Padraic. Please.

I'm begging you.

But...JONJO: Shush, like, Padraic.

Just, you know, shush, like.Yeah, I'd shush, like.

I will shush.

Except me and me sister were thinking you might just be a bit depressed, Colm.

And I tell you this much, fingers just confirms it.

Don't you think, Colm?

Starting from now.

Well, I never heard the like.

I never heard the like.

He must really not like you, Padraic.

Fingers!

Jesus. He's serious, lads.

He is serious!

You can see it in his eyes he's serious.

Just because he thinks you're dull.

That's going overboard!

Who told you about the dull?

Well, I overheard it.

Like, what was I supposed to do?

I don't think you're dull.

And jeez, if I was to cut something off meself for every dull person that came in here,

I'd only have me head left.

Do you think I'm dull, Gerry?

No.

That said,

I did think the two of ye always made a funny pairing, like.

No, we didn't.JONJO: Yeah, ye did.

Ye did. Obviously, ye did.

'Cause now he'd rather maim himself than talk to ya.

Colm was always more of a thinker.

Huh?

Why's every... I think.

Ah, you don't, Padraic.

You don't, Padraic.Your sister does.

Your sister does, aye.

Siobhan does.You're more of a...

You're more of a...

What is he?

You're more one of life's good guys.

You're more one of life's good guys, aye.

Apart from when you're drunk.

Apart from when you're drunk, aye.

I used to think that'd be a nice thing to be.

One of life's good guys.

And now, it sounds like the worst thing I ever heard.

Ah, don't take it like that, Padraic.

Don't take it like that, Padraic.

We're on your side.

What are you smiling at?

What's this mope so mopey for?

He's just a fecking man, lads!

A fat, ginger man!

Ay yi yi.

I'll tell ya this much.

Ye two are awful mopey hosts.

Luckily, you won't have to put up with us more than one night, so, and try eatin' with your mouth closed.

Where are we now, France?

Will you tell him, Padraic?

Aye, stop being a little fecking bollocks, Dominic.

No. Just about the mouth thing.

Colm Doherty and his fat fecking fingers.

He probably wouldn't even be able to cut through the blubber on them fingers.

Would you not want him to have to do the one finger to see if he was bluffing, like?

No, we wouldn't.

That's what I'd have him do,

I'd have him do the one finger to see if he was bluffin'.

'Cause worst comes to worst, he can still play the fiddle with four fingers, I'll bet ya.

Or the banjo.

We don't want any of that.

We just want nothing to do with him no more.

You don't. This gom does.

I am a gom, is right.

You're not a gom!

Jeez.

This is a depressing house.

Would you prefer your own, so?

I've heard it's a barrel of fecking laughs.

Well, touche.

Too what?

Che. Touche.

It's from the French.

And how is it, Siobhan, that you was never married?

It's none of your fecking business how I was never fecking married.

How isn't it?

How isn't it?

Was you never wild?

Wild? Was I never wild?

I don't know what you're talkin' about, Dominic.

Wild, how? Angry?

'Cause I'm gettin' angry now,

I can tell ya!

Not angry. Wild.

You just keep sayin' wild, Dominic!

Wild!My brother told you, didn't he?

That you'd be out in the road if you started talking stupid to me?

He said creepy, not stupid.

Well, you've failed on both counts, haven't ya?

I have.

I'm off to bed and he's not stayin' here another night, Padraic.

I don't care how depressed you are.

I'd rather have the donkey in.

Foiled again.

But "faint heart" and all that.

Here.

Ye two, ye'll be all right.

Will we be?

Hello there, Mrs. O'Riordan,

I've the milk outside for ya.

So, it's the two weeks you owe me for now, I think.

Nobody has a lick of news for us from your side of the island, Padraic.

Are you going to be the same as them?

I am, Mrs. O'Riordan, I'm afraid.

And I'm in a bit of a rush, so...

Eileen Coughlan had no news.

Vincent Shaughnessy had no news.

It was a poor old week for news.

But then it is, sometimes.

ColmSonnyLarry, he had no news.

Did he not?

That man never talks.

Eh, he talks sometimes.Up himself.

Aye, aye, anyways, so, it's the two weeks you owe me for now, Mrs. O'Riordan.

As I was sayin'.

Ladies.

Oh, it's Peadar.

Peadar always has a rake of news.

What news have you, Peadar?PEADAR: News, is it?

Fella killed himself, over Rosmuck way.

Walked into a lake for himself.

Twenty-nine and nothing wrong with him, the fool.

God love us!

No, not "God love us." Fool!

Another fella,

Protestant, of course, stabbed his missus in Letterkenny.

Six times he stabbed her.

Good God!

And did she die, Peadar?

She did die, aye.

It wasn't with a spoon he was stabbin' her.

That's a lot of news.

This man has no news, don't ya not? No-Newsy!

Stukes never have news.MRS. O'RIORDAN: Stukes!

Funny.

There was a bit of news

I remembered, Mrs. O'Riordan.

Dominic Kearney's father beat Dominic senseless with a kettle Saturday, and is staying with me and me sister, Dominic is.

So, at least his father'll take a bit of a break from his beatin' of him.

And him, a policeman.

Isn't that news?

Ar, that Dominic's an awful little bollocks.

That's no news.

Still, he was in a bad way when I came upon him.

I'd beat him with a kettle meself if I wasn't old.

It's news is all I'm sayin'.

That's no news.

That's shite news.

Okay, so, Mrs. O'Riordan, thanks for the...

I'll see ya when I see ya.

And you can tell that skitter of a son of mine he'd better be home by teatime, or it's over to batter the both of ye I'll be, and your dreary fecking sister, too!

Oh, hello there, Colm.

Will I see you at Jonjo's tonight for that pint you owe me?

I owe you no pin...

You will, Peadar.

Good man yourself.

Whoa, stand.

Stand.

What's that, Jenny?

Will we go to the pub for ourselves?

We will. Come on.

One drink you're havin', lady, then it's off home with ya.

I've a shirt that wants ironing for the morning.

Okay, Daddy.

Aye. Off to the mainland in the morning I'm headin'.

That's why I need the clean shirt, like.

"And why are you off to the mainland in the mornin', Peadar?"

Oh, thanks for asking, Colm.

I'll tell ya why.

They've asked for extra manpower for a couple of the executions in case there's any kind of a to-do, like.

Six bob and a free lunch they're payin' me.

And sure I'd have gone for nothin'.

I've always wanted to see an execution, haven't you?

Although, I'd have preferred a hanging.

Who are they executin'?

The Free State lads are executin' a couple of the IRA lads.

Or is it the other way around?

I find it hard to follow these days.

Wasn't it so much easier when we was all on the same side, and it was just the English we was killin'?

I think it was.

I preferred it.

But you don't care who's executin' who?

For six bob and a free lunch,

I don't care!

They could be executin' you.

Why don't you come with me?

You could write a miserable feckin' song about it.

Nah, I'm only messin'.

Who are them?

Music students, I think, from Lisdoonvarna.

Another whisky, anyways, Jonjo.

Jeez, you're goin' at it at a fair old lick tonight, Padraic.

Yeah? What's it to ya?

Padraic, don't now...

Go get Siobhan, Dominic, would ya?

What are you after, gobshite?

Another beatin', is it?

You, copper, I'm allowed to chat to you, aren't I?

It's just tubbyguts

I'm not allowed to talk to.

Actually, no, I'd rather you didn't talk to me neither.

Oh, well, anyways, do you want to know what the three things that I hate the most on Inisherin is? Not really.

One, policemen.

Two, pudgy fiddle players.

And three...

Wait, I had some funny thing for three. What was it?

Uh, I'll start again. One, um, policemen.

Two...

Pudgy fiddle players.

Pudgy fiddle players.

And shite, what was three?

Go on back to your own gang now, Padraic.

I'm serious, now.

Serious, are ya?

And talkin' to me, are ya?

Siobhan!

Padraic's out of his brains on whisky, and Colm's there.

You'd better come.

You, Colm Doherty, do you know what you used to be?

No, Padraic, what did I used to be?

Nice!

You used to be nice!

Didn't he not?

And now, do you know what you are?

Not nice.

Ah, well,

I suppose niceness doesn't last then, does it, Padraic?

But will I tell ya something that does last?

What? And don't say somethin' stupid like music.

Music lasts.Knew it!

And paintings last.

And poetry lasts.

So does niceness.

Do you know who we remember for how nice they was in the 17th century?

Who? Absolutely no one.

Yet we all remember the music of the time.

Everyone, to a man, knows Mozart's name.

Well, I don't, so there goes that theory.

And anyway, we're talkin' about niceness.

Not whatsisname.

My mammy, she was nice.

I remember her.

And my daddy, he was nice.

I remember him.

And my sister, she's nice.

I'll remember her.

Forever I'll remember her.

And who else will?

PADRAIC: "Who else will" what?

Remember Siobhan and your niceness?

No one will.

In 50 years' time, no one will remember any of us.

Yet the music of a man who lived two centuries ago...

"Yet," he says, like he's English.

Come home, Padraic.

I don't give a feck about Mozart, or Borvoven, or any of them funny name feckers.

I'm Padraic Suilleabhain.

And I'm nice.

Come home.

So you'd rather be friends with this fella, would ya?

A fella who beats his own son black and blue every night that he's not fiddling with him.

I never told him that, Daddy.

He's... He's just drunk now.

You used to be nice.

Or did you never used to be?

Oh, God.

Maybe you never used to be.

I'll have a word with him, Colm.

You don't need to do anything drastic.

He won't be botherin' you no more.

That's a shame.

That's the most interesting he's ever been.

I think I like him again now.

It was the 18th century, anyway. Mozart.

Not the 17th.

Siobhan Suilleabhain!

Well, well.

I only came in for rashers, Mrs. O'Riordan.

I've no time to talk, I'm afraid.

Letter came for ya.

Fell open, did it?

Aye, in the heat, I suppose.

A job offer, is it?

A job offer from a library on the mainland, is it?

Just the rashers, please, Mrs. O'Riordan.

About ten of them.

You never tell me anything!

Well, it'd crucify him, your leaving!

Hey, no one's leaving!

Listen, I didn't come down to chat.

I just came down to say that all that last night was just the whisky talkin', Colm.

All what last night?

All whatever it was I was sayin'.

What were you sayin'?

Uh... Yeah.

I can't remember much of it, but I remember the gist of it wasn't the best.

You always know, don't ya?

Well, anyways, I just wanted to say I was sorry.

Will we leave it at that?

Why can't you just leave me alone, Padraic?

Huh?

I've already told ya, haven't I?

Yeah, I know. I was just...

I mean, why can't you just leave me alone?

What are ya doing?I don't know.

For fuck's sake, like.

How... How's the new tune?

What?

Ar, for God's sake, Padraic.

How many more times?

I am not putting me donkey outside when I am sad, okay?

Well, stringy bits of shite

I had to pick up yesterday when ya let her in!

There was no stringy bits in that donkey's shite.

There was bits of straw, if there was anything.

Maybe it was straw, so.

I'll get us our porridge.

Was I awful last night?

No, you was lovely.

Well, I know I wasn't lovely now, Siobhan.

You were lovely.

About me, anyways.

Of course I was lovely about you.

What else is there to be about ya?

What was that? A bird?

What was what?

The bang at the door.

A bird?

Aye.No.

What was it, so?

The bang at the door?Aye!

What was the bang at the door?

It was, uh... hard to lie... it was, uh... a finger.

A what?

Finger.

Jesus, Siobhan!

You'll frighten the little fella!

Throw it out, Padraic!

I'm not throwing his finger out!

It'll get dirt on it!

Where... Where'd you put it?

Shoebox.

Oh, my. Oh, God.

Well, he's serious, then.

Do we have to have it in here while we're eating?

Once I finish me porridge,

I'll bring it back to him.

Are you feckin' stupid?

I mean, are you feckin' stupid?

No, I'm not feckin' stupid.

We've had this discussion.

You've got to leave him alone now, Padraic. For good!

Do you think?

Do I think? Yeah, I do think!

He's cut his feckin' finger off, and thrown it at ya!

Come on! It wasn't at me.

Well, what are we going to do?

We can't keep a man's finger.

Jesus, Colm!

Did it hurt?

Hurt awful to begin with.

Thought I was going to faint.

It's funny, feels fine now, in all the excitement.

Would you like a cup of tea?

I won't, Colm. I only came up to give you your finger back.

Oh, yeah?

Thanks.

Cleared up quite nice, actually.

And you wouldn't have thought it would.

What do you need from him, Colm?

To end all this?

Silence, Siobhan.

Just silence.

One more silent man on Inisherin, good-oh!

Silence it is, so.

This isn't about Inisherin.

It's about one boring man leaving another man alone, that's all.

"One boring man"!

You're all fecking boring!

With your piddling grievances over nothin'!

You're all fecking boring!

I'll see he doesn't talk to you no more.

Do.

Else it'll be all four of them the next time, not just the one.

You're not serious.

Well, that won't help your fecking music.

Aye.

We're gettin' somewhere now.

I think you might be ill, Colm.

Do worry sometimes

I'm just entertaining meself while I stave off the inevitable.

Don't you?

No, I don't.

Yeah, you do.

Declan!

Howdo!

Howdo!

Do you want a ride?

I will so.

Thanks, fella!

Oh, no, you're not that student fella from Lisdoonvarna, are ya?

I am. I'm Declan.

Why?

They told me at the post office to try to find that student fella, Declan, from Lisdoonvarna.

Yeah, a telegram came for ya.

From your mammy.

My mammy is no longer with us.

Not your mammy, sorry.

Did I say your mammy?

Your auntie. Yeah, your auntie.

It's about your daddy.

What about Daddy?

Uh, bread van crashed into him.

The bread van?Yeah.

They said you'd best hurry home to him, lest he should die all alone.

Die?

Or get worse, all alone.

This is impossible.

It's not impossible.

Bread vans crash into people all the time.

I know!

That's how me mammy died.

If it's the same fecking bread van, I'll kill them.

Thanks.

What were you talking to the boat fella for?

For none of your fecking business, I think it was.

Of course, it's me business.

Aren't I the law?

Fecking knob.

Huh?

Well, you can tell that whiny brother of yours

I'll be around soon for that battering I owe him.

A battering?

That'd be good, actually.

It might take him out of himself.

Huh?

You're an awful strange lady.

No wonder no one likes ya.

Oh.

Hello there, Mrs. McCormick.

A death shall come to Inisherin afore the month is out.

A death, huh?

Maybe even two deaths.

Well, that'd be sad.

We shall pray to the Lord

'tis neither you, nor poor Siobhan, will be either of them.

Well, is that a nice thing to be sayin'?

I wasn't trying to be nice.

I was trying to be accurate.

Fecking hell.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

Me daddy say he's gonna kill you Sunday for spilling the beans about that fiddling with me.

"Kill me," kill me, or, you know,

"beat me up a bit," kill me?

"Beat you up a bit," kill ya, I think.

Although he did kill a man once.

I'm sorry for that spilling the beans on ya, Dominic.

I was out of order that night.

You was funny apart from that bit.

That's why I don't understand why that fat fella threw the finger at ya.

He seemed fine when you were slagging him.

He did not.

Did he?

"That's the most interesting

Padraic's ever been," he said.

"I think I like him again now."

Aye.

Maybe this whole thing has just been about gettin' you to try a new tack, start standin' up for yourself a bit.

Do you think?

Yeah, and be less of a, you know, whiny little dull-arse.

Well, I have been less of a whiny little dull-arse, actually.

Have ya, yeah?

Just yesterday, there was this musician fella that Colm was getting along great with.

And what did I do?

I went and sent him packing from the island.

Did ya? How?

I told him a bread van crashed into his daddy, and he'd have to be rushing home to him, lest he die.

Oh...

That sounds like the meanest thing I've ever heard.

Huh?

Well, aye, it was a bit mean, but... he'll be fine once he gets home and he finds his daddy hasn't been hit by a bread van.

I used to think you were the nicest of them.

Turns out you're just the same as them.

I am the nicest of them.

Ar, Dominic, now!

Well, maybe I'm not a happy lad, so!

Maybe this is the new me!

Aye.

Maybe this is the new me.

Howdo!

Jesus Christ, Dominic!

Would you ever stop creeping up on people?

You almost gave me a fecking heart attack!

I wasn't creeping up on ya.

I was sidling up on ya.

Between you and that ghoul, Jesus!

I always call her a ghoul, too, because she is a ghoul.

Jeez, we have a lot in common, don't we?

Me and you.

Calling old people ghouls and that.

It's a great old lake, isn't it?

I'm glad I caught you, actually.

Because there was somethin' I was wantin' to ask ya, actually.

And discovering how much we have in common, well, it just makes me want to ask you even more.

We don't have anything in common.

Uh, don't skip ahead.

But yeah, what I was wantin' to ask you was...

Somethin' along the lines of...

Should've planned this, really.

Well, yeah, what I was wantin' to ask you was...

You probably wouldn't ever want to, I don't know, to fall in love with a boy like me, would ya?

Oh, Dominic, I don't think so, love.

No, yeah, no.

Uh, I was thinking no.

Not even in the future, like?

Like when I'm your age?

Yeah, no, I didn't think so.

Just thought I'd ask on the off chance, you know, like, "faint heart" and that.

Well, there goes that dream.

Well,

I best go over there and do whatever that thing over there I was gonna do was.

Mm-hmm.

Come on, Sammy, you have to dance too.

How are you, fatty?

Dancing with your dog, is it?

Well, who else is gonna dance with ya?

Your poor dog has no say in the matter.

And if you're too rude to be offering me a seat,

I'll be taking one of me own accord!

Now, how's that for an old hello?

Have you gone fecking mental?

Have I gone fecking mental?

No, I haven't gone fecking mental, actually.

Not only have I not gone fecking mental, but I have ten fingers to prove

I've not gone fecking mental.

How many fingers do you have to prove you've not gone fecking mental?

Nine fingers.

And nine fingers is the epitome of mental.

That's right. The epitome!

Heh. There'll be none of that!

I didn't come here for licks!

I came here for the opposite of licks.

What's the opposite of licks?

Huh?

What did you come here for?

I didn't come here for anythin', did I?

I just came to kick your door in and give you a slagging.

Well, you've done that, so you can go now.

Haven't finished yet, have I?

Well, I finished with your door.

I haven't finished with your slagging.

We were doin' so well, Padraic.

I wasn't doing so well.

I was doing terrible.

All right, I was doin' so well.

Yeah, well, it can't all be you, you, you, can it?

Yes, it can.

There's two of us in this. No, there isn't.

It takes two to tango.

I don't want to tango.

Well, you danced with your dog.

Talkin' of tangos, how's your new tune comin' along?

I just finished it, actually.

Just this morning.

No, Colm, that's great, like!

That's why I was dancing with me dog.

I don't usually dance with me dog.

There's no harm dancin' with your dog.

I'd dance with me donkey if I knew how. And she did.

Is it good?

Your tune?

Mm, what's it called?

"The Banshees of Inisherin,"

I was thinking.

But there are no banshees on Inisherin.

I know, I just like the double S-H sounds.

Aye.

There's plenty of double S-H on Inisherin.

Yeah.

Maybe there are banshees, too.

I just don't think that they scream to portend death anymore.

I think they just sit back, amused, and observe.

Portend?

Yeah.

I keep having thoughts about playing it for you at your funeral.

But that wouldn't be fair on either of us, would it?

Well, that's great that you finished your tune, Colm.

That's more than great.

That's... really great.

So, do you want to meet me down the pub, Colm?

We could celebrate your tune, like.

Only if you'd like, like.

But I could run up ahead.

Order them in.

Why don't you do that, Padraic?

Why don't I run up... and order them?

Well, I will so.

Jeez, that went well!

And maybe on the way,

I can find that student friend of yours, that Declan fella!

I told him his daddy was dying, so he'd feck off home and leave us alone, but there's no need now!

Sure he could join us.

What are you sitting over there for when I'm over here?

Just thought I'd have a sit for meself, you know.

Wait for me friend.

Are you fecking joking me?

Your four-fingered friend?

I mean, are you fecking joking me?

No, I'm not fecking joking ya.

He just needed a bit of tough love was all.

Siobhan, do you want a sherry?

No.Righty-ho.

What are you doin'?

Me? Yes, you.

Nothing. Just drinkin'.

Not waitin'?Not waitin'.

Well, he is waitin', Siobhan.

He's waitin' for Colm Doherty.

I amn't waitin'.

He just told me he was waitin'.

Telltale!

Come home with me, Padraic.

I've somethin' to discuss with ya.

You've somethin' to discuss with me?

That sounds, uh...

I don't want to discuss somethin'.

Well, ya have to, 'cause I'm leavin'.

Leavin'?

Like leavin'?

Like... not staying?

Yeah.

But what about me?

What about you?

I'll have no friends at all left!

You'll have Dominic. Ah here!

And he's gone off me now, too.

What kind of a place is it when the village gom goes off ya?

And who's gonna do the cookin'?

Oh, that's your first question, isn't it?

"Who's gonna do the cookin'?"

Well, it wasn't me first question, was it?

"But what about me?" was me first question.

Padraic.

Padraic!

Now?

But you can't be leavin' now!

I can be leavin' now.

I can't be waitin' round for any more of this madness!

What the hell did you say to him, Padraic?

Nothin' really.

Well, I'd sort of had a chat with Dominic earlier.

And a new sort of, you know, standin' up for meself sort of tack we thought I should try.

God!

It was all going fine until he chopped off all his fingers.

Me books wouldn't fit.

Would you look after them for me?

Ar, don't go, Siobhan.

They're all I have, really.

Apart from the obvious.

You'll be back soon, won't you, Siobhan?

Oh, Padraic!

Don't say, "Oh, Padraic."

Say yes.

Ah, Jenny.

Oh.

I don't want to talk.

Don't go killin' his dog now.

And don't be puttin' things in me head that weren't there in the first feckin' place, you feckin' nutbag!

"Nutbag!"

What would I ever hurt you for?

You're the only nice thing about him.

How are you, Padraic?

You're lookin' well.

That's lovely, lads.

I don't need your apologies, all right?

It's a relief to me.

So, let's just call it quits and agree to go our separate ways, for good this time.

Your fat fingers killed me little donkey today.

So, no, we won't call it quits.

We'll call it the start.

You're jokin' me.Yeah, no.

I'm not jokin' ya.

So tomorrow, Sunday,

God's day, around 2:00,

I'm going to call up to your house and I'm gonna set fire to it, and hopefully you'll still be inside it.

But I won't be checkin' either way.

Just be sure and leave your dog outside.

I've nothing against that gom.

Or you can do whatever's in your power to stop me.

To our graves we're taking this.

To one of our graves, anyways.

Here.

I've a bone to pick with you, dreary.

Is that little gobshite of mine at your place again?

Leave him, Peadar.

His donkey's just died.

Did he?

The little miniature fella?

Well, Jesus, boys,

I'll tell ya this much...

Two o'clock.

I killed a miniature donkey.

It was by accident... but I do feel bad about it.

Do you think God gives a damn about miniature donkeys, Colm?

I fear he doesn't.

And I fear that's where it's all gone wrong.

Is that it?

Is what it?

Aren't you forgetting a couple of things?

No, I think I've covered it.

Wouldn't you say punching a policeman is a sin?

Ah here.

If punching a policeman is a sin, we may as well just pack up and go home.

And self-mutilation is a sin.

It's one of the biggest.

Is it?

Self-mutilation, so you have me there.

Multiplied by five.

How's the despair?

It's back a bit.

But you're not gonna do anything about it?

I'm not gonna do anything about it, no.

Dear Padraic,

I am safely ensconced in the mainland and, Padraic, it's lovely here.

There's a river running past my window as I write, and the people already seem less bitter and mental.

I'm not sure why, but I think it's

'cause a lot of them are from Spain.

Mostly, I wanted to say there's a spare bed here for you, Padraic.

And with the war almost over, I think there'd be work for ya here.

Because there's nothing for you on Inisherin.

Nothing but more bleakness and grudges and loneliness and spite and the slow passing of time until death.

And sure, you can do that anywhere.

So come, Padraic. Leave there.

Dominic can look after Jenny and the rest of your animals.

They could move into the house together.

Hut!

So come now, Padraic, please.

Before it's all too late.

Dear Siobhan.

Obviously, I don't know what "ensconced" is, but I thank you for the offer of the free bed and the whatnot.

But I won't be takin' you up on it, I'm afraid.

As I told you, me life is on Inisherin.

Me friends, me animals.

Even now as I write, little donkey Jenny is looking at me, saying,

"Please don't go, Padraic.

We'd miss ya."

And nuzzling me, the gilly-gooly.

Get off, Jenny.

MRS. McCORMICK: Psst!

In other news, in sadder news, actually,

I won't be able to ask Dominic anything, I'm afraid.

Because they found him in the lake this morning.

I suppose he must've slipped and fell in.

So, there'd be no one to take care of the animals, anyway.

No other news, really.

Except that I love you, Siobhan.

And I miss ya.

And I hope I'll see ya again someday.

If you ever come back home.

Come back home, Siobhan.

Yours sincerely, your loving brother...

Padraic Suilleabhain.

Suppose me house makes us quits.

If you'd stayed in your house, that would've made us quits.

But you didn't, did ya, so it doesn't, does it?

I'm sorry about your donkey, Padraic.

Honestly, I am.

I don't fucking care.

Haven't heard any rifle fire from the mainland in a day or two.

I think they're coming to the end of it.

I'm sure they'll be at it again soon enough, aren't you?

Some things there's no movin' on from.

And I think that's a good thing.

Padraic.

Thanks for lookin' after me dog for me, anyways.

Any time.





# The Fabelmans

Mommy and Daddy will be right next to you.

The lights will go down.

There may be some organ music as the curtain opens.

Don't be scared.

It'll be dark in there, you said.

- I don't want to go in.

- But it's fun.

All week, you've been so excited.

Your first ever movie.

- And the people are gigantic.

- What people?

You said the people in the movie are gigantic.

Oh, because of the big screen they're on but they're not real, right?

- They're like dreams.

- Dreams are scary.

Some dreams are, but this is gonna be a nice dream.

About a circus and clowns and acrobats and...

You want to know how it works?

There's a big machine called a projector.

Inside, there's a big bright light and it projects photographs

- of... of clowns and acrobats.

- And elephants.

- Projecting means it sends them out.

- Happy things.

Happy things like light from a huge flashlight.

But these photographs move past the light really fast.

Twenty-four photos in every second.

Now, in your brain each photograph stays for about a 15th of a second.

And that's called persistence of vision.

The photographs move past faster than your brain can let go of them and that's how the movie projector tricks us into believing that motionless pictures are moving.

A motion picture.

Movies are dreams, doll, that you never forget.

You just wait and see.

When it's over, you're gonna have the biggest, sloppiest smile on your face.

They're letting us in.

Wait till the engines pass.

Unlock the door.

Pass it down.

- What's that?

- Second section.

Angel. She's on that train.

So what? We got the dough.

Let's get out of here.

Lights, I must turn the lights down the track.

You crazy lunkhead.

Give me that wheel.

We are going to turn the lights!

The train! Stop the train!

Stop the train!

Stop! Can't you see the lights?

Stop!

The first section! Hold it!

Angel!

Angel!

What was your favorite part?

Sammy, what do you want for Hanukkah?

I told you this wasn't a good idea what with all of his A-N-X-I-E-T-I-E-S.

Kids his age have big I-M-A-G-I-N...

- No fair spelling out

- A-T-I-O-N-S.

The long words.

The lights change how everything looks.

It's hard to find our house.

Ours is the dark house with no lights.

That's what I want for Hanukkah.

- What?

- Christmas lights.

Sorry, dolly.

Jews don't get Christmas lights.

Eight nights of candlelight.

Who could ask for anything more?

Who could ask for anything more?

Can I sleep with the oscilloscope?

Get going. We got to burn rubber.

- What's that?

- Second section.

Angel. She's on that train.

The lights, I must turn the lights down the track.

Stop the train, stop the train!

Angel!

Mommy!

Mommy!

I know what I want for Hanukkah,

I know what I want for Hanukkah!

Baruch atah Adonai,

Eloheinu melech ha-olam

asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tsivanu l'hadlik ner shel Hanukkah!

Thank you.

Sammy.

Oh, my God. I want to try it on.

Down by the station

Early in the morning

See the little pufferbellies

All in a row

See the station master

Pull the little handle

Puff, puff, toot, toot

Off they go

Down by the station

Early in the morning

See the shiny train cars all in a row

Waitin' to get hitched up

And go on their adventure

Puff, puff, toot, toot

Off they go

Okay, so the outside grounds, the middle conducts the power and these two metal wheels under the engine complete the circuit.

So, new, Mr. Engineer?

RCA gave you a raise?

That is one expensive trolley car.

It's not a trolley car.

It's a Lionel train.

No raises for the computer guys this year.

Next year maybe.

Your moonlighting son is paying for it by filling up my house with broken TVs.

Repair work, that's how.

Oy, careful he doesn't electrocute himself.

Don't scare the boy.

- Hold on.

- You're okay.

You're not taking that fancy train to Florida without me.

Hey, look.

She's down on the floor.

Who's gonna help her up?

Who says I'm getting up?

I'm going to Miami on the Sammy Limited.

Go ahead.

They're precisely-engineered toys.

You can play with them when you've learned to treat them with respect.

I do respect them. I love them.

I know you do, but you can't just love something.

You also have to take care of it, right?

Maybe we can play together with them this weekend.

But I need to see them crash.

I don't understand.

Why does he need to see them crash?

It's late.

You don't want to shut your light?

In a minute. I'm still wide-awake.

You see these descending notes?

That's called a lament bass.

You should play it on the radio on that arts program.

They keep asking you to go back.

I don't have time for that.

Well, we can hire a sitter.

Who can afford that? Forget it.

That was another life.

That was two kids ago.

You know what I miss most about the piano?

Surrendering to the score.

Knowing Bach is gonna tell you how...

First, this note, then this chord then you open your hand, you stretch down an octave...

Making a little world you can be safe and happy in.

Thank you.

That's why he needs to watch them crash.

He's trying to get some kind of control over it.

Sammy?

We're going to use Daddy's camera to film it.

Only crash the train once, okay?

Then after we get the film developed you can watch it crash over and over till it's not so scary anymore.

And your real train won't ever get broken.

One more thing, dolly.

Let's not tell your father.

It'll be our secret movie, just yours and mine.

- Okay?

- Okay.

Sorry I'm late, I picked up

Ms. Moynahan's Motorola.

There's no room left in the workshop.

- Where should I put it?

- The living room, I guess?

Okay.

Hey, sorry I'm late.

I picked up Mrs. Fabelman.

Where should I put her?

Let go of me, you swine.

Are you not ashamed?

- Did the mail come?

- It's on the table.

Cossack.

This is brisket?

My movie!

After supper.

The amount of magnetism is increased by how magnetically permeable the core material is.

The tricky thing is how permeable we can make it.

Am I supposed to be following any of this?

You know what a magnetic field is, right?

Yeah. Well, sure. I mean, it...

Sammy, do you know what a magnetic field is?

- Can I be excused?

- Nope.

But I need to, just for a minute.

- What's so urgent?

- Honey.

This tastes funny, Burt.

It tastes funny on a plastic fork.

- Ma.

- Is she saving the silverware for when the Eisenhowers drop by?

The problem is we're using vacuum tubes not transistors, and magnetic cores

- 35,000 magnetic cores.

- To try to access memory...

Hey, Sam.

You know on your father's camera when the film runs out?

When that happens, what do you do?

- Load more film.

- The same with computers.

You have to load more tape, and that slows everything down.

Mitz, the chopped liver was beyond belief.

Load it with data and instead of changing tapes every ten seconds this new machine he's engineering...

- The BIZMAC!

- The BIZMAC.

It can search for information through all these tapes at once.

You never need to change any of them.

- It'll be ten times faster.

- I love Burt's brain.

Especially when you're around to explain what's in it.

Mom, I have to go upstairs now.

Not until you've finished eating.

He cleaned his plate.

No, he didn't.

Sammy.

Hey, Natalie, I think there's something under your plate.

- Sammy.

- No, there isn't.

Lift it up and check.

I saw it moving.

Licorice.

If there's anything

I'm a sucker for, it's licorice.

Uncle Bennie, that was so disgusting.

- No, no!

- Natalie, he is not your uncle.

Also, he is not that funny.

"Uncle" is a term of affection.

Natalie, he's not related.

He's only always here because he works for my son.

He's only always here because he's my best friend.

And deep down inside you,

Mrs. Fabelman, admit it

I'm your friend, too.

Deep down inside of me is none of your business.

Sid Caesar's on tonight. Help me.

- Natalie, get that corner.

- What?

Get the corner, get the corner.

Can I help you take it out?

Sammy.

I had to crash it a whole lot of times but the train never got hurt.

Golly.

I thought that was

The Greatest Show on Earth.

Oh, more, more, more...

Head back. Open.

Candy corn in.

Say, "Ah."

Head back.

Ketchup. Okay.

Scream like it hurts.

Pull it!

Sammy.

Take off the blindfolds.

Sammy?

Reggie, Natalie, come downstairs pronto.

Your father has an announcement.

General Electric wants to hire me because of what I did on BIZMAC.

They want to use my electronic library system to...

Well, I... I don't think they have any notion of what I can do with it and I'll make more money.

Is Uncle Bennie coming, too?

Well, Daddy and me haven't had a chance to think...

- Bennie, no. He lives here.

- About Uncle Bennie.

Burt.

I'll miss your Uncle Bennie, too, but Phoenix is a real neat city.

It's on the rise.

They've only just hired me.

I've got no pull there yet.

I can't ask General Electric to hire somebody else on my say-so.

- That's not how it works.

- Don't ask them. Do it yourself.

They're hiring you to manage.

Managers hire. Hire Bennie.

Who's watching... Sammy.

He's got to make a name for himself at RCA.

That's what I did.

He'll stay in New Jersey, get out from under my shadow and then...

- He needs you, Burt.

- There's a tornado outside!

Yeah, well, there's a bigger one in here.

Honestly, honestly, Burt, sometimes, I want to shake you.

You're gonna leave him behind with just a... a shrug?

- Mommy...

- "We'll see ya later."

And once we're gone, who will he have left in New Jersey?

You have an opportunity to help your best friend.

- Honestly, wake up.

- Mommy...

- Mom! Look!

- What?

There's a tornado outside.

- I'm scared.

- Just go...

You weren't kidding.

How close is it?

Why does the sky look orange?

Come on!

Come on. Let's go see.

- Get in, get in!

- Mitz?

Where are you going?

Mitz, where are...

Hey!

Where are you going?

Mitz!

Mitzi!

Where is it? I can't see it anymore.

Up ahead somewhere. We'll find it.

Mom, it's there, it's there!

Is this safe?

Of course, it's safe.

I'm your mother.

- Mom, stop!

- Stop!

Everything happens for a reason.

Everything happens for a reason.

Everything happens for a reason.

Say it with me.

Everything happens for a reason.

- Everything happens for a reason.

- Everything happens for a reason.

- Everything happens for a reason.

- Everything happens for a reason.

- Everything happens for a reason.

- Everything happens for a reason.

I think there's something dead in the road.

Reggie, wave in the camera.

(Hi, Sammy.)

- Ooh, look.

- There it is.

- There it is.

- There it is...

Let me out, I want to take a shot of him pulling in.

- No!

- No, I have to pee now!

Me, too! Now! No!

- No! I have to pee!

- No! I have to pee!

- Keep coming.

- No!

Keep coming, Dad. You're doing great.

And...

Stop.

Freeze.

Where's the lunch box?

Where's the lunch box? Hurry!

Guys, look at the monster

Sammy caught.

I got the babies.

- Sal found babies.

- Look at that.

Sammy, Dean, come on.

There's a huge nest right there.

- Come on, guys.

- A big one, Sammy.

Oh, God.

It's a whole herd of 'em.

Scorpions come in nests.

No, actually, it's a bed of scorpions.

- No, it's a nest.

- No...

The baby scorpions are called "scorplings."

They're twice as venomous. That's...

That's why the lab pays more.

There's got to be like 50 of 'em.

Well, how much is the laboratory gonna pay for them?

Fifty cents per baby.

- That's 25 bucks.

- We're rich.

Well, what are we gonna buy?

Twelve dollars even.

Well, it's the merit badge for photography, not movies.

The manual says you gotta tell a story with still pictures.

Yeah, but all a movie is is still pictures.

You just put a bunch of them together and they move.

Okay, but what kind of movie are we making?

Sammy, look. It's Janet Benedict.

Hey, go on and talk to her.

I dare you.

He already talked to her.

- No way.

- Like hell.

No way. He actually spoke to her?

He did, he did.

He walked right up to her.

- And he...

- You went up to Janet Benedict?

- What did you say to her?

- Nothing.

Oh, come on.

Tell them what happened, Sammy.

Nothing happened.

Something happened. Come on.

Could be the same one.

"Overland."

Say, I think it is the same one.

Well, I declare.

So...

Sammy kind of sidewinds his way in her direction.

And he's trying to...

He's trying to work up the nerve to say something slick and smooth

- like, "Hey, Jan, baby."

- Hey, no, I wasn't.

You're making this up.

But... But he sees that Janet's got something on her nose.

So, now he's thinking, "Cool.

Here's my excuse to go up and talk to her."

So he goes and he says,

"Hey, sorry, Janet.

It... It looks like you have a little smudge on your nose."

- Shut up, Hark.

- But it wasn't a smudge.

- It looked like a smudge.

- And it wasn't little.

Hark, shut up.

It was a booger.

A big, fat, Janet Benedict booger.

It was huge. I can't believe it.

Hey, Sammy.

Stand and deliver.

What kind of movie are we gonna make?

Stand and deliver.

No, keep screaming. Keep screaming.

I need more dust.

Dad, can you grab the sandwich board?

No, no. God, no, no more dust. No.

Reggie, stop coughing!

I'm coughing because there's dust.

- Okay. More dust, fellas.

- Natalie.

- Say, "Please don't kill me."

- All right.

Reggie, stop coughing.

You're being dramatic.

Mr. Fabelman, you're getting dirt inside my stagecoach.

- Well, we'll clean it out.

- Guys, stop looking into the camera.

- I can't use any of this.

- Dad!

Fake.

Totally fake.

You hear it?

She has got to cut those goddamn fingernails before she goes on live television.

I have to perform this tomorrow.

It's a difficult piece.

It's a very big deal for me.

All I asked was for you to keep your big traps shut and listen to my dress rehearsal.

Sorry, Mitz. It's wonderful.

You hear how the rising arpeggios lift up the sad notes?

It's in F minor, but your mom makes it sound so alive.

She makes it sound like she's playing a typewriter.

Oh, no.

Not this again.

Do you hear it? Am I clicking?

I concentrate on your playing, but...

But... Oh, great. But what?

- But people can hear it in Tucson.

- Maybe I've gotten used to it.

Maybe GE should make rubber tips for fingernails.

All right, Mitzi Fabelman.

Time to face the music.

Oh, boy.

You stay away from me with those things.

- It's Beethoven, damn it.

- No...

- It is not Morse code. Come on.

- No! Stop, stop!

- Stop it!

- He has a point, though especially with the polydirectional ribbon microphones they have on television stage...

Come on. You married her.

- Dad, don't.

- Do it...

I will scratch you.

Don't think I won't!

Do you think Arthur Rubinstein had fingernails?

- Horowitz? Schnabel?

- Do not think about it.

- Kempff?

- No...

- Liberace.

- No...

- Come on, Fabelman.

- Not my nails.

Show her who's General Electric's

- product design manager.

- No, my beautiful nails.

I paid a buck 50 at the beauty parlor for these.

Oh, no.

- One, two, three...

- One, two, three...

- Get off of me, Delilah.

- Delilah?

Okay, the fun's over.

I'll do the rest myself.

Oh, great. Just great.

Well, that decides it.

I'm gonna play the program from memory tomorrow.

No sheet music, short nails, like a real performing artist.

You dropped your gun?

- See the names?

- That's right.

Come on.

That's me.

Real scary, Sheriff.

How'd you do that?

How'd you do that?

- Yeah!

- Go, Sammy!

It's kind of like what I do, isn't it what a movie director does?

- It is?

- I figure out what my division needs to accomplish then I work out how my guys are gonna get it done.

Yeah, it is. Yeah, sort of.

How'd you make it look like the guns were really firing?

I did it with pins.

Pins.

Yeah, I poked holes in the film with pins.

- Sammy.

- Yeah.

Thinking like an engineer.

Watch the road, Dad.

Sammy, watch the road.

I can't edit without an editing machine.

I have to be able to cut and splice, and I...

Let's revisit it after the camping trip.

It's three hours to the national forest.

If you get your license, you can help with the driving.

Okay.

"You are approaching a railroad crossing with no warning devices and limited visibility.

The speed limit is..."

See, the thing is, though, about my new movie is that it's just...

It's about World War II, your war.

It's gonna be, like, out of this world.

I'm shooting on a Bolex H8.

Finally, I can use double run film.

You know, that's six minutes

- without having to change the reel.

- How much did you spend to rent this camera?

Twenty bucks.

But I used my own money.

- You don't have to...

- And this movie editor gizmo costs?

It's a Mansfield

- 8mm movie editor.

- How much?

- Eighty bucks.

- Doggone it, Sammy.

A hundred dollars for a hobby?

It's not a hobby, Dad.

If you spend half the time on algebra

- that you spend on these movies...

- Algebra? I hate algebra.

Why are you...

It's completely pointless.

Not if you want to make something, it's not pointless.

Gee, Sammy, when I was a boy,

I always used to think

"Somebody figured out how to make this."

- Yeah.

- This car.

That rearview mirror, that directional signal.

I want to make movies, though.

I mean something real.

Not imaginary.

Something someone can actually use.

Like a driver's license.

I'm gonna vomit, Sammy.

I'm gonna vomit.

Sammy, please pull over.

She's gonna puke all over me.

Go slower.

You are the worst driver.

You're gonna break the car.

We're on a back road going three miles per hour.

- Calm down.

- You're doing great, doll.

- You're doing great.

- Okay, watch out. Puddle up ahead.

So, we've got three that are strong and still green inside so they don't burn.

Bright green means that they're still alive and that they carry moisture.

And the reason that we use the shape of the triangle is that when these three points connect if we find the center of gravitational force it creates almost perfect balance.

Because I'm Tutti, and you're Frutti.

So, who else are you gonna listen to?

- Okay.

- The pyramids, right?

- I mean, the history...

- Guys, come on.

Behind this shape... is pretty... is pretty incredible.

Oh, hello.

Hi.

Wait. Let me try it...

- Let me try it like this.

- Okay, one more time.

- Yeah, after one more time.

- Okay.

- Ready?

- Girls, I'm gonna start the fire.

- Three, two, one!

- Okay. Really big, really big.

Go!

- I thought it was gonna break.

- It's... It's happening!

You almost broke it in half.

Kleenex-ica, Windex-ica

She's sexy-ca, Oh, boy

Pneumonia, dyslexia

Leukemia, oy, oy, oy, oy

Leningrad, then Petrograd

I'm sorry, Dad, I lied

I snatched the keys and stole the car

And took it for a ride

You take it back, paskudnyak

You giving me a...

Heart attack!

- We'll take a schvitz and have a...

- Shmitz!

- And eat some...

- Schnitzelpitz

- And drink slivovitz

- And we'll lose our wits

- And we'll get the shits

- And have...

We live in Arizon-ia

Where nothing can be grown-ia

The land is dry and stony-a

And we can eat bologn-ia

Exactly. Okay.

Hyena, eat some pita

Eat some pita, hyenas

- Eat some pita, hyenas

- Eat some pizza, eat some pita

They're gonna know that kind of FPU is not for industrial process control and it will raise every red flag there is.

- How many bits?

- Float64.

Sixty-four bits?

Sixty... You are nuts.

And time-sharing for 11 operators?

They're gonna know this is a business machine we're building and we're all gonna get fired.

No.

Yes!

GE doesn't build business computers.

We do heavy industry processing.

You got that straight from the CEO.

Ralph Cordiner is gonna skin you alive.

Once Bank of America buys in, this will be profitable and that's Mr. Cordiner's job, making money.

My job is getting Raytheon to deliver 10,000 germanium transistors that meet our tolerance standards.

And your job is to get the cabling diagrams to Pitney Bowes so when the time comes, we have a sorter to hook up to the mainframe.

Well, maybe Pitney Bowes will hire me after you get us both canned from GE.

Isn't it worth getting canned for the chance to build a machine that can do all that?

It's worth it to you, maybe.

Sure as the Lord made little green apples

California, here you come.

IBM is waiting.

Are we moving to California?

- You are, any day now.

- No...

- What?

- IBM's asking

- and that's flattering, but...

- Flattering, flattering?

Every guy in computer would give his matzo balls to get an offer.

You'll be in California building double-precision auxiliary units with an FP64.

I'm gonna be left schvitzing in Arizona

- making 40-watt light bulbs.

- Hold your horses.

- Congruence? Come on.

- I told your mom it'll be up to her.

I'm not uprooting us again unless she says yes.

Why would Mamaleh ever leave all of this for California?

We have the Grand Canyon.

They have the San Andreas Fault.

Mamaleh says...

I will never leave Arizona and Arizona will never leave me.

Kids, avert your eyes.

Hey, man.

Shouldn't you be filming this?

Not enough light.

GE, living better electrically!

Mom?

Mom, everyone can see through your dress.

Reggie, get out of the way.

Dad, can you please stop this?

- Come. Sit.

- No.

Bennie, don't look.

Oh, you're all nuts!

My mama's such a good mama.

I love you so much.

I'm right here.

I'm right here with you.

I'm holding your hand.

Can you feel that, Mama?

I just gave you a squeeze.

I love you, Mama.

Ma.

Mommy?

She opened her eyes.

Nurse.

Mommy, I'm here.

Here. I'm right here.

I'm right here, Mama.

Mommy, look at me.

Mommy, can you hear?

It's a Mansfield 8mm movie editor.

That's what you wanted, right?

Oh, my God.

Now, I need a favor in return.

Okay.

Okay... Here's the favor.

Yeah.

I want you to make a camping trip movie.

You can learn how the editing machine works while you do this.

It'll make your mom feel better.

Yeah.

That last night when she danced in the headlights, that'd be great.

Get to it tomorrow, okay?

Tomorrow's when we start shooting.

Escape to Nowhere.

We're shooting all weekend.

- Dad, I can't.

- Shoot it next weekend.

We've got, like, 40 guys coming to be in the movie.

I'll... I'll work on all the camping trip stuff on Monday.

I'm asking you to do this now for your mom.

- She's...

- Yeah, and I said that I will.

Just not tomorrow, please.

Don't be selfish.

She just lost her mother.

That's more important than your hobby.

Dad, can you stop calling it a hobby?

It'll cheer her up, watching this.

- It's something we can do to...

- Her mom just died. It's...

- How is that gonna cheer her up?

- Because you made it for her.

Something's not right.

I don't know what else to do.

Can you help me?

- Hello.

- Mitzi.

Mitzi.

Mama?

Somebody's coming.

Mama?

Mama. What...

- You mustn't let him in.

- Mama.

- You mustn't let him in.

- Mama, I... I can't hear you.

I am scared.

You mustn't let him in the house.

- Mama, please. I...

- Do not let him in.

- Do not let him in the house.

- What? No, I can't...

Who's coming?

Don't open the door.

Mama.

Mommy, don't go. Don't go yet.

You're having a bad dream.

This is a lot of food, Mom.

Well, I'm upset.

Oh, my god. That crazy dream.

I can't get it out of my head.

Last night, I dreamed

I got a call from my mama.

And she wanted to warn me.

- That's silly. Grandma died.

- About what?

Well, something's coming.

She wants me to batten down the hatches.

We're never going to be able to eat all of this.

Who is that?

It's Uncle Boris.

Uncle who?

Mom?

That's who she meant.

My... That's my... my mama's brother.

Oh, he scared the crap out of her when they were kids.

Don't let him in.

You were in the circus?

Mama said you were the lion tamer.

No, not at first.

At first, it was, "Podgorny, pound in the tent pegs.

Podgorny, muck out the pachyderms."

And then, one night, the big cat act, he comes down with the flu bug so it was "Boris Podgorny, in with the lions."

He's lying, right?

- No, he's telling you a story.

- Know what it's like, huh?

Pain in the ass, sisters.

That's rude.

- He said "ass."

- I know.

But when did you start working in the movies?

1927.

1927, that was The Jazz Singer.

That's the year that talkies started.

Yeah, sure, talkies. But me, no.

I started with Uncle Tom's Cabin.

Not a talkie.

It was Harry Pollard.

He acted for Selig Polyscope.

He married Maggie what's-her-name.

He directed Uncle Tom.

Lift up your plate.

So Pollard needed help with the bloodhounds.

So my pal Fleischaker was a big name in dog acts.

Poodles, mainly.

But, "Sure,"

Fleischaker says to Pollard.

"Yeah. Bloodhounds, poodles, what's the difference?"

So he went.

But by this time

Fleischaker, he had it up to here with the Jew-haters.

There was a lot of that kind in the circuses.

Not many Jews, lots of Jew-haters.

- Right.

- But the movies...

Oy vavoy.

Fleischaker writes to me,

"Boris," he writes.

"Boris," he writes...

"Hollywood is heimish, heimishe.

I'm in a minyan with Douglas Fairbanks and Ricardo Cortez."

"Come to Hollywood." So I went.

Your wife, she doesn't like doing the dishes?

Piano hands.

Fershteyn.

So you like the movies, huh, Mr. Pitselshas?

Okay, so the sergeant, he comes over the hill here and I'm gonna go below him, so we see him and the sky.

And so we don't see what he sees, but we do see that he's really...

Okay, so he's, like, almost losing his mind, right?

Because what he is seeing is totally terrible.

And then I'm gonna turn the camera so that we see it.

It's just in another notebook.

Hang on.

If that's the movie... you could show me instead of describing me to death.

No, that's just our stupid camping trip.

My dad's...

He wants me to put this camping film together so it'll cheer up Mom.

Because her heart is broken.

Because her mama iz toyt.

But you, Mr. Director, you don't want to do this what your daddy tells you because you want to make your war picture, huh?

Yeah, yeah.

Believe me, Sammy boy, I get it.

Family, art.

It'll tear you in two.

You hear that?

- Oh, yeah. My mom's practicing.

- Sha.

- She's always...

- You talk too much. Listen.

When she was a kid, already, she played like that.

She should have been a concert piano player.

Little Rubinstein, she was.

She could have played...

You name it, she could have played there.

And she...

Once, I visited her and Tini and Menashe in Cincinnati and she says to me, she wants to be a great piano artist.

But she didn't do it.

Yeah, she's really good.

You know, she played on TV.

TV? Feh.

She could have played at Musikverein in Vienna.

You see, what she got in her heart is what you got, what I got.

Art.

Like me. Like you, I think.

We're junkies, and art is our drug.

Family, we love.

But art, we're meshuga for art.

You think I wanted to leave my sisters, my mama, and my papa and go stick my stupid head in the mouth of lions?

Putting... Putting your head in a lion's mouth is art?

No. Sticking your head in the mouths of lions was balls.

Making sure the lion don't eat my head, that is art.

You see, Tini, she didn't say to Mitzi

"Go do what you gotta."

I mean, she was a good person, my sister, but she was scared.

Scared for your mother.

She should have safety in the family.

So Mitzi, she gave it all up.

I want you to remember how that hurt.

Because when they say all this when they say, "What you do?"

"Oh, that's cute. It's a hobby.

It's like stamps or butterfly collecting" you feel your face, how it feels now.

Yeah, you almost pulled it off.

So you remember your Uncle Boris and what he's telling you.

Because you're going to join the circus, I can tell.

You can't hardly wait.

You want to be in the big top.

You'll shovel elephant shit until they say

"Okay, Sammy, now ride the goddamn elephant."

Oh, you love those people, huh?

Your sisters, your mama, your papa.

Except...

Except this.

This, I think you love a little more.

- No, I don't.

- Yeah.

Oh, hey, run all you want, boychik but you know

I ain't whistling Dixie here.

You'll make your movies, and you will do your art.

And you'll remember how it hurt.

So you know what I'm saying?

Art will give you crowns in heaven and laurels on earth.

But it'll tear your heart out and leave you lonely.

You'll be a shanda for your loved ones.

An exile in the desert.

A gypsy.

Art is no game.

Art is dangerous as a lion's mouth.

It'll bite your head off.

Look at me.

Look at me.

Is it a wonder that Tini, she wanted nothing to do with me?

With me, with...

Oh, Tini.

Oh, Tini.

Oh, Tini.

I... Oh, Tini.

Stop... stop it.

What, you never saw nobody grieving before?

Let's go to sleep, bubbala.

You can sleep in the bed.

- I have my sleeping bag.

- I'm sitting shiva for my sister.

I sleep on the floor. You...

You want to sleep on the floor too?

She was your grandma.

Tear your clothes, sleep on the floor.

Good night.

- Say "bye-bye."

- Bye-bye.

Bye-bye.

I don't know what Mama was so worried about.

It was a nice visit.

Yuck.

This is the life.

Only you can prevent forest fires.

It's so beautiful, what you made, dolly.

You really see me.

Hey, man. How about that, huh?

Hey, Sammy, that was real neat.

Die, Amerikaner!

Move, move! Fall backwards!

Attacke!

Hey, cover!

Krauts, they're everywhere!

There's too many of them.

Turn.

Cut. Great. Now...

Okay, come here. Come here.

You're standing here a minute looking down at what just happened.

A whole minute?

I'll give you a signal when

I want you to start to move, okay?

- Wait.

- So you're just...

You mean I should count to 60?

- Like, one Mississippi...

- What? No...

Don't... Don't count to 60.

You just got to...

So... So, you're all, like... "Oh, my god."

Like, "All my men, they're all... they're all dead, all my men."

So you want me to, like, act and stuff.

Well, yeah.

Like I'm... I'm sort of sad or something?

- Because my whole platoon...

- Right, right. Your platoon.

Your... Your men.

They've been wiped out.

These guys, they're your family.

Your family's being, like, murdered and it's your fault.

- You did this to them, and you...

- I thought it was the Nazis that...

Okay, yeah, but it was you who gave the order to go down into the Valley of Death.

Okay? You decided. Nobody else.

You could've...

You could've protected them. Okay?

Because they trusted you, and they loved you.

Now you're just looking at this... at this thing that you've done, and... you can't save them anymore.

Because they're all dead.

- Wow, that's...

- Yeah.

Real gung ho.

Okay, okay.

- You good?

- Lock and load.

Yeah, yeah. Lock and load.

- All right.

- Good.

Sammy?

How far are you gonna let him walk?

Cut!

Hey, that's a cut, Angelo!

- Angelo!

- Angelo!

- Come back!

- Come back!

- He said, "Cut!"

- Angelo, hey!

- Bravo!

- Bravo!

- Bravo!

- Bravo!

Sammy!

Oh, dolly.

You're not a civilian anymore.

That movie, my God. It was...

Hi, Mrs. Fabelman.

Mr. DeMille.

Come here.

- Hey, there he is.

- Congratulations, young man.

- Congratulations.

- Hey...

I guess you based it on your dad's war stories, huh?

Sort of, you know, but he doesn't like

- to talk about it, so...

- No, I understand.

Yeah.

Dad, Mom's getting a ride with Bennie.

She'll see us at home.

- Hey, that last scene with the...

- Why do you like blood so much?

And are you ever gonna make a movie with parts for girls again?

- Yeah.

- Make a career...

- What?

- With girls, you know, like...

Because all the men stare off into the distance all the time.

Maybe a girl could save the day.

Okay, what are the five steps to save a drowning person?

All right, one is you swim behind the person so they don't grab you.

Two, you throw your arm across his chest.

- Or her chest.

- Three...

Not Sammy.

He's too scared of girls' boobies.

Three, you swim on your back with the victim on your chest using your free arm to paddle yourself.

And speaking of boobies if you ever get any, we'll have a party.

And at the party, we'll give her the booby prize.

What's four?

- Crap.

- Bring the victim to land, dummy.

Then five?

Call the undertaker.

This is serious business.

I got to know all of this to get the lifesaving merit badge.

More kids die in swimming accidents than in any other kind of accident.

- Sorry. I'm sorry.

- Not everything is a big joke.

Okay, okay.

So, what's step number five?

It's just you laugh at everything even when nothing's funny.

You always have to be the center of attention.

Eat.

And don't talk with your mouth full.

I'm not eating this crud before a swimming test.

You can get cramps in the water if you eat before and you can drown from getting cramps!

Stop shouting at her.

Sammy Fabelman, goddamn it.

For weeks now, it has been nothing but disrespect from you.

Disrespect?

Why are you being such a little shit to me?

Damn it to hell, I'm your mother!

I wish you weren't!

Let me see.

Oh, my God.

Oh, what have I done?

Talk to me.

Oh, Sammy, please talk to me.

Tell me what's happening.

Do you have any idea how much I love you?

Don't go.

Mom.

Mom.

I won't tell.

I won't tell, I won't.

I won't tell.

I won't.

Sure about this?

There you go. Bought and paid for.

Just a second. It's in the back.

Stocking up on Kodak before the big move?

- No, I'm...

- Smart.

Film's cheaper here than in California.

I bet everything's more expensive there.

You're losing your steadiest customer.

Him and his whole family, they're moving west.

He just sold me his camera.

Oh, yeah? How come?

He says he's finished.

Sorry about the wait, Mr. Loewy.

We had to order it special.

You bought a camera?

It's for you.

I know how much you loved using it for your war picture so I figured you ought to have one of your own.

It's a "bon voyage,"

"see you later, alligator"

"I believe in you" present from your Uncle Bennie.

Because it's from me?

This move?

This is your dad's glory-hallelujah moment.

And, oy vavoy, Sammy, does that guy ever deserve it.

All the way back when, back at RCA he knew what computing was gonna be about before practically anybody else knew it.

And IBM?

That's where guys like Burt are figuring out how to use what he's made to...

They're gonna change the whole goddamn world so this was the right decision.

For all sorts of reasons.

Yeah, so I'm happy for you.

You know I am.

But I'm gonna miss you.

All of you, a lot.

You think whatever bad things you want about me, kiddo but you stop making movies, it'll break your mother's heart.

You will break her heart, I mean it.

She doesn't deserve that, not from anybody least of all from you.

I'll give you 35 bucks for it.

You drive a hard bargain, kid.

I'm still done making movies though.

Everybody makes movies in California.

Hey!

Keep the change.

When will the new house be finished?

A few months, in the spring.

Can I have my own room?

Everybody gets their own room.

Yes.

I just remembered, last night, I had a funny dream.

What was it?

I can't believe I dreamed this.

Bennie and me were having an argument and I hauled off and socked him right in the nose.

What's wrong?

- Is Mommy carsick?

- Let's just give her a little time.

Bennie and me, we never... we never...

I would never let it get as far as I imagine you think.

Oh, I never imagined any of that.

You think Dad knows?

I don't... I don't mean...

I don't mean, "Did you tell him?"

I know you didn't.

But...

But you think he has an inkling?

I've almost told him so many times.

I'll say, "Burt, there's something

I've got to tell you."

Then he looks at me like he can't conceive that anything could be wrong between us so instead, I say,

"Burt, we got ants."

Or "Burt, could you climb on the roof and turn the antenna so I can watch channel 5?"

Which, of course, he does.

I can't fight with your father.

He kills with such kindness.

I'm mean to him, he buys me a dress.

From Saks.

Mom, when I showed you what I filmed

I never meant for any of this to happen.

Guilt is a wasted emotion.

What's gonna happen now?

I'm gonna be your mom.

I'm gonna be the girls' mom.

Despite my countless faults

I'm not ruining everything for everyone.

I'm gonna not be selfish.

Burt Fabelman is the kindest, smartest, wisest most patient, most decent, most understanding man there is and I'm gonna stay married to him.

It's only a rental.

The new house will be ready faster than you can say "Jack Robinson."

Jack Robinson.

And we're still here.

Just tell me if you're going to mope for the rest of your life or if it's something you plan to outgrow.

Bug off.

You're, like, going for the misery merit badge.

You and Mom with your long faces.

She can't even get out of bed

- to make breakfast and...

- Okay, new rule, guys.

When we walk to school in the morning let's just leave all the Fabelman mishegoss behind us in the Fabelmans' moldy old rental house.

So for eight hours a day let's be normal kids in an ordinary, normal school, okay?

Some glue on your hand or something.

- Too easy.

- That's what I'm telling you.

It's like... we got parachuted into the land of the giant sequoia people.

All right.

- How much are you even betting?

- Excuse me, excuse me.

Up over. Nice dig. Atta Johnson.

- I got it, I got it.

- Get it up, get it up.

- Up.

- Set...

- Hit it.

- Take it.

- I got it.

- I got it.

Way to get up!

Nice. Set...

Nice. Atta baby, Logan.

Do it again. Go again.

Come on, boys.

Good work, guys.

Keep the intensity. Keep moving.

Rotate. Nice, Jake. Good job, Chris.

Fabelman, it won't hurt you.

It's a volleyball, not a cannonball.

- Okay.

- Let's go. Serve.

Go!

Atta baby.

That's good reactions.

Let's move. Let's...

Oh, my God.

I am so sorry. I didn't...

- I'm gonna...

- Oh, my...

I'm gonna murder you, you piece of shit.

Hey, Chad.

Cool it.

I am... I did not mean to do that.

- Are you okay? I'm...

- That really hurt, asshole.

Watch your mouth, Logan.

Go fetch the ball.

Sure, yeah.

Let's go.

Hey, new kid.

What's your name?

Sam.

Sam what?

Fabelman.

Told you he's a kike.

He doesn't like Jews.

Nobody likes Jews.

Except other Jews, right?

So, Bagelman...

No, that's not my name.

- Don't call me that.

- So...

You gave my best friend a concussion, Bagelman.

- No, I didn't. Leave me alone.

- Hey.

Don't argue with me.

A serious concussion.

So how do we make you pay?

How about this? We...

You're drinking from the fountain.

You never hear me come up from behind you, and bam!

I shatter your front teeth all over the spigot.

Hey, look at me.

He's demented, like, medically.

So watch out for yourself.

Close the door!

- Mom got a monkey.

- Why'd you get a monkey?

Because I needed to laugh.

Oh, help me with this.

The directions don't make any sense.

Careful...

Get down.

I'll get a banana.

Save the curtains. They're rented.

Hello. Who are you?

He's mine.

What are we gonna call him?

Bennie. His name's Bennie.

I don't want to see a psychiatrist, Burt.

You're scaring the kids.

You're sleeping all day.

I miss the desert. I miss dry heat.

You haven't even unwrapped the piano.

You aren't cooking or shopping or unpacking.

Psychiatrists help you know why you're feeling something.

They can't help you feel something different.

You're behaving like when your mother died like you're in mourning, but nobody's died.

Okay.

So I'll call the monkey some other name.

IBM's out of his league, Mitz.

Bennie was... He... is my best friend.

But they don't need him.

This is what I know.

I don't need him either.

Bennie wasn't your friend.

But you knew he was mine.

What does that mean?

Logan, I'm really, really missing you.

Hey! Who's there?

Who's there?

Bagelman, yo.

I left you a little snack in your locker.

Did you like it?

Guess he wasn't hungry.

He said... He said it was...

- What'd you call it, Chad?

- Kosher.

- Kosher.

- Knock it off, moron!

We talked about this.

All right.

Come on. We'll be late for practice.

So what is this? Are you Jewish?

Well...

Holy crap, he's got the hots so bad, he can't even talk to her.

No, I don't.

Apologize to her.

For what?

For making goo-goo eyes at her, for drooling at her.

I wasn't drooling at her.

Then apologize to her for killing Christ.

Why are you encouraging him?

Go on.

Apologize to her for killing our Lord.

Don't go.

- Come watch me run.

- No, thanks.

- I'm not in the mood now.

- Oh, please.

I run better when you are there.

Apologize to her, you Christ-killing son of a bitch!

I'm going home.

Go on and say sorry.

You're getting me in trouble with my girl.

You know, obviously, since I'm not 2,000 years old and have never been to Rome,

I'm not apologizing.

But, hey, you know maybe your boyfriend should apologize to you for making out in the stairwell half an hour ago with some redhead.

He... He's lying. He's...

I... I didn't do that. I swear.

You told me you were finished with her.

Logan, you lied to me!

Claudia.

You made a mistake.

Listen to me.

You made a mistake.

You're gonna fix it.

- Bash his head in!

- Shut up, Chad, goddamn it!

Tomorrow, you're gonna find her first thing and you're gonna tell her you were lying.

Say... Say you were scared.

Say... Say whatever you got to say.

But you tell her it wasn't true, and you did not see me doing that.

Or I swear

I will hurt you worse than you've ever been hurt.

You get me?

Nod to show you dig what I'm saying.

He won't tell me who did this.

Ask him who did this.

Tell your father who did this and he will drive to that little shit's house and he will beat the living crap out of him.

- Is your nose broken?

- No, of course it's not broken.

You think I'd be sitting here

- if his nose was broken?

- Who hit you?

What do you care who it was?

It's not like you'll do anything about it.

Tell me what happened first.

What happened is I hate it here and what happened is you brought us here because...

Because I got a better job, so we moved.

You don't even care where you are.

You get to go to work, and that could be in Iceland.

You're working with your goddamn machines so you get to be happy while the rest of us are miserable...

- Just... come on.

- Mom, don't.

Well, but you... you're bleeding on the carpet.

It's a rental house.

Do you even notice how much we hate it here where we're practically the only Jewish people for miles and everything is awful?

Do you even care that this is your fault... everything that's happening now just because you ran away from home and took all of us with you?

I came here so I could work ten times harder with ten times the responsibility which seems to have escaped everybody

- so I could build us a nice home...

- Could everyone settle?

- I want to say something.

- No, no.

You didn't come here to build houses.

You didn't come here to work.

You ran away.

I think you have something to say to me, Sammy.

And if I'm right about that then get it off your chest and say it to my face!

I started therapy.

Anyways... what I really wanted to say is that about yesterday, what I told you was... it wasn't true, and I lied and I'm sorry.

But why?

What did I ever do to you?

Oh, no, no. It wasn't about you.

Because that, like, really, really wasn't cool, you know?

- I didn't mean to hurt you.

- Because I really love Logan.

Yeah, she cried herself to sleep thinking he cheated on her.

You ought to be more considerate of other people's feelings.

Okay, but Logan told me to say I killed Christ.

- That wasn't Logan. That was Chad.

- What?

- Why would he do that?

- Logan laughed.

He thought it was hilarious.

He's Jewish.

You don't say.

Yeah, I mean, since the day

I was circumcised.

So how'd you know she was a redhead?

Oh, my God.

He was making out with Renee Reynolds?

If you were lying how'd you know her hair color?

Does it hurt?

So you don't believe in Jesus?

Monica's, like, totally hot on Jesus.

I can't imagine my life without him.

Well, we've managed for, like, 5,000 years so I guess it's possible.

Maybe we could...

I don't know, get together and pray on it.

What, like, you and me?

We can ask him to come into your heart and, you know, see what happens.

Yeah... Sure. I mean...

What, like, that would be, like, when?

Like, today?

It's a lot, huh?

It's sort of a shrine almost.

A shrine to guys.

Lots... Lots of guys.

They're sexy.

I guess.

I mean, not Jesus.

Jesus is sexy.

Isn't that, like, a sin or something?

I don't know.

He came to us as a man.

A handsome young man.

He could've come as a girl or an old man or someone with leprosy, but...

Nobody knows what he really looked like.

Probably, he looked like you.

Oh, because... because he was...

Jewish.

A handsome Jewish boy.

Just like you.

Let's pray.

Close your eyes.

Lord, I'm here with my friend Sammy...

Sam.

I'm here with my good friend Sam who's Jewish, and he's a nice boy.

Lord Jesus, he's good and brave and he's funny, Lord, and... and I like him.

Relax.

Ask.

Ask him to come into you.

Ask him to enter you.

Hi there, Jesus.

It's me, Sam Fabelman.

If you're real, show me a sign

- No, wait. You can't...

- or something, and...

You can't ask Jesus to do tricks to impress you.

You have to be humble.

You have to beg him to. I'll do it.

I'm gonna beg the Holy Spirit to come into me.

I'm gonna draw the Spirit in with my breath.

Spirit, come into me!

Please, Holy Spirit!

I'm begging you, sweet Holy Father, for the sake of my friend Sammy.

Sam.

Come into us, Jesus!

Hear our prayer!

Open your mouth.

Open your mouth and take the spirit of Christ into you.

Monica, Sammy, I made snacks.

We're coming.

- Okay.

- Tomorrow after school want to meet out back behind the bleachers?

- Yeah.

- Cool.

We can pray some more.

When I was a girl and I felt sad

I'd go to the zoo and I'd watch the monkeys.

- They made you laugh?

- Yeah, yeah, the monkeyshines.

But there was more to it than that.

It was...

They understand what we've done to them with the cages and the people pointing.

We share that with them, the truth of how cruel people are.

But if you watch them for long enough you can tell they know stuff we can't begin to imagine.

Important stuff.

And they're not gonna let us in on it because it belongs to them.

It's their own monkey business.

Theirs. It's not ours. It's...

Oh, I don't know.

Self-possession.

Right.

They belong to themselves.

If it belongs to itself let it go back to where it came from.

Anyway, that's how come

I got a monkey.

And a therapist.

He throws his poop.

The therapist?

No, the monkey.

That's why I'm staying in a hotel.

You don't have to.

We have plenty of room.

My rabbi in New Jersey says a monkey in the house isn't kosher.

That's why we're not going to eat him.

Did you schedule him for his polio vaccine?

- They can get polio?

- Pass the peas.

Well, they're susceptible to pretty much everything

- humans are, so yes.

- He hates going to the vet.

You see, Monica, in this family it's the scientists versus the artists.

Sammy's on my team.

Takes after me, except he's got real talent.

- Mom.

- And he's completely terrible at science.

And algebra.

And sports.

- Will you please stop?

- He showed me his camera.

Is he good at kissing?

- I'll tell you later.

- Shut up!

He sleeps with a camera under his pillow.

- No, I don't.

- But he refuses to actually shoot anything.

He should shoot Ditch Day.

They still don't have a photographer.

You could volunteer.

- What's Ditch Day?

- It doesn't matter. I'm not going.

Something seniors get to do at the end of the year.

They let us pretend like we're ditching school and we all take buses to Santa Cruz Main Beach.

You have to go. Everyone goes.

My dad will lend you his camera.

It's super fancy.

Costs like a thousand dollars.

It's called, like... an "Air" something, I forget.

- Wait, not an Arriflex.

- Right.

Your dad owns a 16mm Arriflex?

Wow, okay.

- So 16mm on stock...

- See, usually it's the teacher who shoots the Ditch Day movie...

At ten bucks a roll, for a whole day

- that would be

- I owe you a graduation check.

- Like, insanely expensive.

- My dad will get the school

- to pay for it.

- And I need to rent a 16mm editing machine, and I have no idea how much that costs

- so it's not gonna work.

- My dad will rent one for you.

We can rent it, whatever it costs, right?

Burt.

What's wrong with your Bolex?

You could afford to be a little encouraging.

About what?

About him making movies again.

Well, I didn't say that.

I'm just talking...

- Maybe he's moved on.

- On from what?

He hasn't picked up his camera once since we got here.

He'll be going to college this September.

Maybe his feelings about it have changed.

He's growing up.

I'm enthusiastic about that.

Filming is what he loves.

- Oh, Jesus Christ. I'm sorry.

- I don't think him...

Guys, can we please just stop talking about me?

I'd think that you, more than anyone, should have some understanding...

Let's go to your place or something.

Maybe your dad can show me the camera.

- a vocation, a calling is.

- All right, all right.

- We'll rent him the equipment.

- He hates the beach.

That's why he doesn't want to go to Ditch Day.

But it's not your calling.

Is that why you can't respect it?

I have respect for everything he works hard doing.

- He's afraid.

- He's scared if he does

- those guys will beat him up again.

- What? No, I'm not.

I never said that I was scared of them.

- You don't, though.

- You got beat up?

You always dismiss what he does, what anyone does that's playful or imaginative as a pastime or a hobby.

You already won, Mitz.

I surrendered.

I'm not taking the bait.

Can you guys please just cut it out?

You're embarrassing me.

I said I'd take him for his polio shot

- the first five times you asked me.

- Well, you say you will but I guess you don't mean it

- so I ask again and again and again.

- He's scared of shots.

He's scared of the doctor.

I am taking the goddamn monkey to the vet, okay?

Probably needs a tranquilizer with all this yelling.

Can you ask your dad about borrowing the camera?

- He'll say yes.

- Thank you.

I'm filming Ditch Day.

I think it's a great idea.

Nice!

Go, Michael! Go... Come one!

Don't be scared.

Your mom misses Phoenix too much.

- Tell them the truth.

- And I can't leave.

This is where my work is.

I have to...

That's crazy.

You...

You can't ruin everything because you miss one place and you're stuck someplace else.

I miss Bennie too much.

So?

We all miss him.

This is a different kind of missing.

Because what?

You love Bennie?

Don't you love Daddy?

Sure she does.

- Of course, I love Dad.

- And I love Mom.

Then why is this all of a sudden happening?

Stay together.

You love each other, and you love us and we don't want this.

We don't want to have to move back and forth and not live with both of you.

We can't.

- Dad, we can't.

- You're always so mean to him!

That's why you're getting divorced!

It's because of you!

Don't blame your mom.

- This wasn't her idea. It was mine.

- Don't... Don't say that.

No, it wasn't.

She just said it was because of Bennie, so stop lying!

Both of you, stop lying!

I'm giving your mom a chance to go back to Phoenix to live...

I don't understand how you can go back to your beach blanket movie after that.

We're different, I guess.

Is she gonna marry Bennie?

If she wants to, she will.

God, she's the most selfish person in the world.

It must've been hard for her, married to a... a genius.

Dad worships Mom.

Okay.

But maybe it's hard being worshiped by someone you know you'll never be as good as or ever do anything as good as.

She...

She laughs at Bennie's jokes... but Dad's always been her best audience.

Come on.

She'll be fine.

She'll tell herself everything happens for a reason.

She'll make excuses like she always does.

You're way more selfish than her.

That's why you're angry at her.

It's because she's scared just like you, Sammy.

Out of everyone in this out-of-control falling-apart family the one who's most like Mitzi is you.

Wait.

Look, before I show this to the whole school could you please watch it with me?

Thank you so much.

Hold your breath!

Here.

Did you find Jesus?

In a jewelry store.

If you see me walking down the street

And I start to cry each time we meet

Walk on by

Walk on by

Make believe

That you don't see the tears...

Hey, man, look who's here.

Hey, let's get this party started.

Let the festivities begin.

Yeah.

So in September, when I move to LA

I'm gonna try and get work in a movie studio.

Thought you were going to college.

Could you...

Would you ever consider coming with me?

I'm going to Texas A&M.

You know that.

Yes, I do.

But I thought... maybe you should change your mind because...

Because what?

Because I love you.

- Sammy.

- Oh, sorry.

Sorry...

That's not possible.

What? No, it is. Monica, I love you.

That's impossible. Sammy...

Sam.

We only started dating like...

Everything was so normal before.

Why are you acting so...

No, because nothing's normal now.

They're getting a divorce.

What are you talking about?

My mom and dad, they're splitting up.

Jesus Christ. This is prom.

You can't just blurt something out like that at prom.

Wait.

Don't stop

Monica. Look. That's...

That's got nothing to do with us, okay?

That's not why I said that I love you.

- I don't know why I...

- I'm not gonna change my whole life and move to Hollywood because your parents are having marital difficulties.

You can get a refund.

I hardly wore it at all.

Are you breaking up with me?

Not at prom, but of course, eventually.

I'm gonna pray on it.

And I'm gonna pray really, really hard for you because you're such a fun boy to kiss, but...

Well, thank you, thank you.

Wonderful, wonderful.

Let's thank our band for that great music.

Sometimes, we just can't fix things, Sam... and all we can do is suffer.

Now we're gonna take a little break from the dancing for a very special moment for the class of 1964.

Mr. Samuel Fabelman, where are you?

Where is he?

Okay.

Bagelman!

- Bagelman!

- Bagelman!

Okay, everybody.

Face this way. Grab a chair.

Let's all get close to the screen.

Right up front. Very good.

Mr. Fabelman, this is your big moment.

We're ready to watch your Technicolor masterpiece

"Ditch Day 1964."

And as they say way down south in Hollywoodland

"lights..."

"lights, camera, action."

Let's go! Come on!

No...

Logan, you were so incredible up there.

It was amazing.

Why'd you do that?

What?

Why'd you make me look like that?

- In the film?

- Yes, in the film.

Oh, shit, shit.

What's the matter with you?

I've been a... a total asshole to you.

- I broke your nose, and then...

- You didn't break my nose.

Then you go and make me look like... like that.

- You didn't break it.

- What's wrong with you?

Logan, all I did was hold the camera, and it saw what it saw.

Oh, bullshit.

Fabelman, you made me look like... like this golden kind of thing.

- Yeah?

- And Claudia, she just kissed me.

- Mazel tov.

- In front of the whole school.

- Okay, great.

- I treat her shittier

- than I treat you and now she...

- You're welcome, man.

- Jesus...

- No, no. Don't...

Don't go, don't go.

I want to know why you did that.

I don't know.

I ought to have my head examined.

Am I supposed to feel bad now about all that shit we did to you?

Do you feel bad about all that shit?

That's none of your goddamn business!

- Because you should feel bad...

- Oh, right. That's why you did it.

You want me to feel like crap about...

I wanted you to be nice to me for five minutes!

Or I did it to make my movie better.

I don't know why.

You are the biggest jerk

I've ever met in my entire life.

I have a monkey at home that's smarter than you!

You dumb, anti-Semitic asshole!

I made you look like you could fly.

But I can't fly.

I can outrun any guy in Santa Clara County and I worked real hard to do that.

But you, you make me feel like

I'm some kind of failure or a phony or... or like I'm supposed to be some guy I'm never gonna be, not even in my dreams.

You took that guy, whoever he is, wherever you got him from and you put him up there on that screen and told everyone... everyone that that's me.

And that's not me. That's... It's...

Goddamn it, goddamn it.

Jesus, it wasn't supposed to make you upset.

I didn't mean to freak you out.

I didn't mean...

Who cares what you meant?

Fabelman!

Oh, shit.

You liar! You backstabbing liar!

I'm gonna beat your...

You totally bought it, his whole snow job.

You ate it up. You moron.

Logan, you are so conceited and dumb.

Is something about to happen?

You like living dangerously,

Fabelman.

No, I don't.

- I really, really don't.

- Yes, you do.

But you tell anybody about me getting... upset that would be a mistake.

Our secret.

Okay?

Definitely.

Unless I make a movie about it.

Which I'm never ever gonna do.

You never...

What's it like?

It kind of shows you how out of control everything is and how you're not in charge of anything.

And... and how it doesn't matter.

I better not.

In my head, everything's already out of control.

You're full of shit.

I got to split.

Claudia's waiting for me.

Life's nothing like the movies,

Fabelman.

Maybe not.

But, hey, in the end... you got the girl.

Must have been some night.

Did Monica like the corsage?

- Yeah.

- Well, I told you she would.

That time when I hit you... in... in Phoenix, when I...

Oh, God. You remember.

Not really.

Oh, for the love of God, it's not like I spent my whole life hitting you.

Once. I hit you once.

It should've been memorable.

Before the swimming test.

Yes, before the swimming test.

Yes. Well, I... I...

I... slapped you on your back... as hard as I could,

I screwed up your tryouts and you... you couldn't get your merit badge and then you couldn't make Eagle Scout.

Ma, I made Eagle Scout.

It wasn't a big deal.

Well, I left a goddamn mark on your skin in the shape of my hand.

And I need you to say you forgive me for doing that.

- Well, okay. I forgive you.

- Because... Because...

- Because you're my kid.

- Mom, I forgive you.

And... and my kids mean more to me

- than anything else on the Earth.

- Mom, I forgive you.

- I forgive you.

- Because...

Please, please, because how am I ever gonna forgive myself?

- I can't.

- Mom, I...

I forgive you.

The eggs are burning.

Oh, God.

I'm doing this thing.

And I... I don't know if it's the right thing but it's a life-and-death thing for me, and I'm sorry, but... everybody else is gonna have to hang on for dear life.

And somehow we will survive this, all of us.

Even your father, who I adore with all my heart.

He deserves so much better than what I'm doing, but... but Bennie needs me, dolly.

And I need him.

So much so that without him,

I'm turning into someone I don't know and none of you will know me anymore.

I'll just be that hateful person who did that terrible thing to your back.

And yes, this is the most selfish thing I have ever done but I've got to do this now because, Sammy... you do what your heart says you have to because you don't owe anyone your life.

Not even me.

Are they ruined?

I... I can make some more.

Oh, no... I like them burnt.

So Monica dumped me.

She did?

Yeah, after I told her about the divorce.

Probably shouldn't have asked her to marry me.

- You did not.

- Oh, but...

You did?

- In so many words.

- Poor girl.

Dad?

Hey, Dad, I'm home.

Sammy?

I think I'm having a heart attack.

Come here.

It's a panic attack.

Your mother gets them.

What did you do when she'd get them?

- I made her tea.

- Okay.

Plus, you're exhausted.

You don't sleep.

I hear you walking around all night or typing those letters and the three hours' drive to the college

- every day and back, it's...

- Oh, no...

I can't go back to that dorm.

Maybe your roommate settled down.

He voted for Goldwater.

I can't go back.

Dad...

I don't know... what to do anymore.

I don't want to disappoint you and I promised that I'd stick it out but two years is like forever, and I hate school.

Like, a lot.

And I want to get work on a movie or a TV show so I send out all those letters but nobody ever writes back.

And my life is just going by so fast but it's not getting anywhere.

Concentrate on sipping.

It'll calm you down.

Here.

You can go through the mail while I get the soup hot.

It's from Mom.

It's just a bunch of goofy photos from some kind of block party.

Dad?

Dad, what's...?

Oh, Dad, I didn't mean to.

If you hate school so much, don't go.

But... Dad, we need...

I don't know, I would like you to because this film thing...

I don't know.

Maybe I should have put my foot down about it years ago, but...

I know you're gonna work like the dickens on whatever you wind up doing because you're a chip off the old block.

We're never not going to know each other, Sammy.

How do you know that?

You and Mom don't anymore.

Yes, we do.

We always will.

I know it because... we've gone too far in our story to actually say "the end."

You missed something in the mail.

Good news?

They've ordered 32 half hours.

Fridays at 8.30pm on CBS, starting September 17th.

We already have six shows in the can.

It's like Stalag 17 or The Great Escape except it's funnier.

And it's for television.

- And it's funny.

- Yeah.

Or at least I pray to God that it's funny.

Hogan's Heroes.

That's the title. What do you think?

- Pretty catchy, right?

- Catchy. Yeah.

And if all goes well

I might be able to offer you something next season.

Maybe assisting an assistant to an assistant.

You don't want to be in TV anyway.

Your letter said as much.

By the way, I love this letter.

I used to write a whole bunch of these letters when I was your age.

You want to make movies. Am I right?

Well, yeah. Yes, I do.

But look, I'm just happy to start anywhere and... and that doesn't...

You know who you need to meet?

I mean, not for a job, because he doesn't do that.

How would you like to meet the greatest film director who ever lived?

And he's right across the hall.

Come on.

Wait here a minute.

This is Nona.

Nona's gonna look after you.

He's not here. He's...

- He's at lunch.

- Right.

- You want to wait?

- Yeah, he'll wait.

Sit.

Good luck.

Could be hours.

All right, kid, you got five minutes.

Probably one. Stand up.

Lose the tie.

You'll stand a better chance.

They tell me you want to be a picture maker.

Yes, sir, I do.

Why?

This business, it'll rip you apart.

Well...

- Mr. Ford, I...

- So, what do you know about art, kid?

I love your movies so much.

No. Art.

See that painting over there?

Yeah. I mean, yes.

Yes, I do see it.

Walk over to it.

Well, what's in it? Describe it.

Oh, okay.

So there are two guys and they're on horseback and they're looking for something.

- So maybe they're scouting...

- No, no.

Where's the horizon?

The... The horizon?

- Where is it?

- Yeah, it's at the bottom.

That's right.

Walk over to this painting.

Well?

Right, okay.

So there are five cowboys.

- You know, they could be Indian...

- No...

Where's the goddamn horizon?

It's... it's there.

- Where?

- At the top of the painting.

All right, get over here.

Now, remember this.

When the horizon's at the bottom it's interesting.

When the horizon's at the top it's interesting.

When the horizon's in the middle it's boring as shit.

Now, good luck to you.

And get the fuck out of my office.

Okay.

Thank you.

My pleasure.

Thanks.

Hey, hey, hey.

Take your shoes off.

- Hey, where's the Slinky?

Got it.

Here... Like this.

- I wanna speak to the manager right now.

- May I help you with something?

Are you the manager?

- Yeah?

- Coming!

- Yeah?

- Gotta talk to your mom.

- Moonee, who was that?

- Nobody.

- Shit, Moonee. What did you two do?

- Nothing.

Yeah?

Halley, this woman's from next door, and she said Moonee did something to her car.

You in 322?

No, FutureLand.

Okay.

Her and her friend Scoot spit all over my kid and my car.

- It's Scooty!

- It's Scooty, not Scoot.

You saw them do this?

Yes, I did.

And their friend's father told me that they're always pulling this shit.

That's not true.

Which friend?

Whatever. They spit on my car, and they spit on my kid.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

Halley... One, sort this out.

Two, you smoke in the room again, you're out of here.

- I'm not smoking.

- Bye, Bobby.

- Last warning, Halley.

- Yeah, well, I'm not.

Asshole.

Come on, you two.

Go get some paper towels.

Bertha!

We need paper towels!

We need paper towels!

Okay.

These two yours?

These? No. They're not mine.

Well, they're mine now.

My daughter made me a grandmother when she was 15.

So I'm just taking care of them until she stops acting like her stupid father.

When'd you move in, Grandma?

That's my goober. My goober!

Oh, my God!

You got another one of those?

- Hey, girl!

- Hey!

- You had another one?

- Yeah.

When was this?

- Stop!

- Hey. Hey, guys.

You're having too much fun, and it's not supposed to be fun.

It's supposed to be work, okay?

- It's summer, let them have fun.

- Get on it.

- No worries.

- Let them have a good time.

- It's summer, what do you want?

- I think it was very disrespectful.

Very disrespectful.

This is not okay.

Clearly we have different versions of disrespectful.

- What's your name?

- Jancey.

Jancey? What kind of name is Jancey?

Hey, Jancey.

It would be a whole lot easier if someone were to help us.

- They're doing you a favor.

- I am ashamed for you right now.

Are you serious?

- Doing me a favor.

- Okay, well...

It didn't need that kind of car wash.

Hey, hey.

Jancey, honey, what are you doing?

- I'm cleaning up!

- Yeah!

Jance, let them clean it up by themselves, okay? That's not your job.

No. They ask-ed me to, so I'm gonna do it.

- No, I don't want you doing that. Okay?

- Let her help.

We should clean the inside, too.

It's a mess.

You think they're gonna get along if they're not gonna, like, socialize?

- That's what they do here.

- Yeah. Social kids, like you.

Yep, like me.

What are you trying to say, lady?

I'll spark you up,

'cause you seem stressed.

I will help you out.

Maybe that's what I need.

I need to lighten up, I need to light up, and I need to get laid.

Same here, girl. I feel you.

Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

- My turn.

- Okay.

Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

Yo!

- Hey, baby.

- Hey, mama.

Hi, Miss Ashley.

Here you go.

- Thanks.

- Here you go.

Hey, yo, my mom wants to know if you want to go to OBT tonight.

- It's Saturday, right?

- Yeah.

Okay, then, we're gonna go.

Bye, guys.

- Bye.

- Go have fun. Be careful, okay?

- Bye, Mommy.

- Bye.

No maple syrup.

- She didn't pack any for you?

- No.

My mom makes mistakes all the time.

Well, you need to let her know we like the maple syrup.

I always tell her, and then she forgets.

Oh, look!

- Middle finger!

- You're a wild animal.

Hey.

Hey, guys!

- Hey, girl!

- Thank you so much!

No problem. Of course, of course.

- Let me know if they misbehave.

- Of course.

Guys, behave, okay? Seriously.

- How you been?

- I've been good.

I've been good. Working, you know.

Taking care of the baby. You already know.

- Hi, babe!

- Hi!

So good to see you.

Hey!

Hey!

What's popping, Don?

- They fucking chose Simone.

- Are you fucking kidding me?

I know, right? I've been there way longer than that bitch. I can't even believe it.

Fuck that!

The second that I'm manager, you're totally hired, Ma. I got you.

Don't be tight. Let's just have a good night. Let's have a good night.

Smile!

Most of those ratchet-ass bitches were doing extras, you know?

In the backroom?

I'm not doing extras.

I'm dancing for tips. That's what I do.

I said no.

Two days later, with no warning,

Hector fires me.

After not letting me up on stage all fucking night.

- Halley, I'm sorry, but...

- Fucking bullshit.

Okay. I'm sorry to say that's gonna affect your TANF.

No shit. That's why I'm here.

Okay, Halley. Please make a concerted effort to put in 30 hours.

Ha! You find me 30 hours.

I have applications in at every shithole up and down the strip.

And the parks ain't gonna hire me.

Okay. So can you please control your language in front of her and everyone else in here?

Can you just give me some bus passes?

Why did I even come out here?

Halley, please. I'm trying to...

Hi. Could Dicky come out and play?

After what you guys pulled, he's punished for a week.

- Where are we going?

- Just come on.

Like, lady, open it!

Hello there.

What?

Could Jancey come out and play?

What, you're gonna take her to spit on someone else's car?

No. We're just playing.

Yeah. Just playing.

- What are you playing?

- We're just playing!

Okay, what are you playing?

You didn't answer my question.

What are you playing?

- Relax, your daughter is safe in my hands.

- And my hands, too.

Jance? Do you wanna go play with the kids from the purple place?

I wanna play.

I wanna play, too.

Hey, guys, don't you live over here?

Yeah but, we have more things to show you.

Come on!

I don't... I don't love oranges.

I don't love oranges.

I... I love orange soda.

We squoosh...

But the only thing

I don't like about oranges is the lid.

- You mean the peel?

- The lid.

Yeah, that's called a peel.

Don't you think we're going too far?

No. Just come on.

Don't be a... Don't be a loser.

Don't call me that. But, okay!

And this is where we get free ice cream.

- Really?

- Yeah.

Follow me.

- Could we have some money?

- Some change?

- Do we have enough?

- I'm counting.

Let's go.

- Excuse me.

- Excuse me, miss.

Could you give us some change, please?

We need to buy ice cream.

'Cause we don't have any money.

We just have five cents.

- Yeah. We just have five cents.

- And the doctor said we have asthma,

- and we gotta eat ice cream right away.

- Yeah.

- Yeah, my doctor too.

- Ice cream.

Guys.

- We're not lying.

- It's fine.

- Thank you very much!

- Here you go.

- Come on.

- Let's go.

Come on!

Excuse me. Excuse me. Hello?

Get that thing, girl.

- I feel like I'm...

- Okay. Wanna see the boss?

Hey!

My turn.

And because you're new,

I'm going to give the last bite to you.

The man who lives up here fought in some wars. And he drinks beer.

This guy has a disease that makes his feet large.

Oh, and no one uses the elevator 'cause it smells like pee.

The man who lives in here gets arrested a lot.

This... This woman in here thinks she's married to Jesus.

Oh, watch out, watch out for the water.

'Cause guess what.

I went to the hospital one time.

These are the rooms we're not supposed to go in.

But let's go anyway!

Oh, fuck!

Bobby!

What's going on?

Where's the power?

Bobby!

Hey, what the fuck, man?

I pay my rent, $1,000 a month.

Can't fucking get electricity.

I'm on it! I'm on it! Folks, come on.

Come on, give me a minute.

- It's gonna be all right.

- It's the hottest day.

I'm gonna get your power working.

I know. I know.

I can't rush any faster than I'm going.

- What's wrong?

- What did Bobby do now?

Trauma's over, folks.

You got your power back.

Can use your TVs, VCRs, AC, what have you.

Have a nice day!

Love you, Bobby!

I love you too.

Try paying the bills, Bobby.

You're due too, brother.

Crock pots, hot plates. These rooms are not designed for extended stay, Gloria.

You know that, for fucking sake.

- What do you want us to do?

- I pay a lot of...

The electric was out for five minutes, that's it.

Yeah, I want a discount for this week.

Why don't you just check out and go down to the fucking Wishing Star?

I like Whale. He's nice.

Well, he's not nice to me!

Look.

Daddy...

Moonee, you're not gonna get that?

- Yeah?

- Halley, open the door.

Fucking A. What'd you do now?

Open the door, Halley.

Yeah?

I got a videotape of the kids illegally entering the utility room.

Don't act guilty, okay?

Hey, Scooty? Did you hear what I just said to her? Okay.

I got it. Imma talk to her.

Happens again, you're outta here.

It's only the second week of the summer, and there's already been a dead fish in the pool...

We were doing an experiment.

We were trying to get it back alive!

- That wasn't my idea.

- And water balloons thrown at tourists.

You can't fuck with tourists.

- They didn't tip us.

- Are you serious?

- No...

- Oh, my God, this is unacceptable.

I've failed as a mother, Moonee.

You've disgraced me.

- Halley...

- Yeah, Mom. You're a disgrace.

And, I'm gonna talk to Ashley, by the way.

When your friend puts you in charge of her kid, that kid becomes your responsibility.

You ain't taking responsibility.

And you got that one too.

She's from FutureLand, right?

Oh, whatevs. You gotta relax, my man.

You gonna redo my expense reports with your whatevs?

Your kid killed my night.

I wanted to watch the ballgame.

You gonna pay me for three hours that I gotta work later?

Hey, guys, pay the man for his three hours.

I don't have any money.

We don't have any money.

- You're shit outta luck.

- Speaking of which...

You haven't given me this week's rent yet.

You don't think I know that? Chill.

Thank you.

- You done here?

- Yeah.

- Thank you.

- Watch those kids.

I think I wanna go home now.

Wait. Uh, hold on. I, uh...

Sir, I think we're at the wrong place.

This the address you gave me.

What did he say?

No, I-I-I... There's a problem.

Uh... This is not where we're staying.

Hey, you wanna check the address?

We are going to the Magic Kingdom...

You said you booked a hotel at the Magic Kingdom.

That everything was taken care of.

What is this, we are not even on Disney property.

Shit. João booked it for me. I don't know.

You had your assistant book our honeymoon hotel?

What's going on? How can I help?

Look. They made the reservation online...

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Hey, what's up, man?

Yeah!

Ooh. Nice bags.

- Are those guys tourists?

- Hey, man.

I'm gonna have to charge you wait time.

I'm missing calls.

Wait, wait, wait.

I'll get the new address. One second.

Look, just call the company, all right?

Just call the company...

- She looks pretty.

- Yeah.

But I feel bad for her,

'cause she's about to cry.

I can always tell when adults are about to cry.

You can tell that?

Yep. 'Cause look what I'm drawing.

- Yeah?

- Yeah, yeah.

What's up, Bobby?

- It's almost midnight.

- Get your bags.

The only room you're gonna find is a single along this stretch.

I offered them a AAA discount.

She doesn't want...

See my wife, there? Okay? She's Brazilian.

Brazilians love Disney.

She's been coming here since she was a kid, all right?

And her dream is to have her honeymoon at Disney.

- Everybody...

- Ma'am, they're just trying to get a tip.

Yeah, tips are grateful.

- Hey, kids. Kids.

- What are these stray children rummaging about?

- Come on.

- This is a welfare, slum motel.

- Leave her alone.

- We're spending our honeymoon in a gypsy project?

Find another place.

Check the Polynesian first.

Or the Grand Floridian.

I told you.

- Leave her alone.

- We're spending our honeymoon.

The resorts are booked.

I'm not staying here.

Does this have to be here?

Guests come through this door, for Christ's sake, Bobby.

Will you go talk to her?

Tell her to go to the back.

Yes, sir.

Excuse me.

- Um, hi.

- Who's in charge here?

Yeah, that's me.

- Hi.

- Hi.

Could you move the van to the back of the building?

To the back of the building.

- So right behind these stairs right there.

- Excuse me! Excuse me!

- What would you like?

- I want that. I want that. I want that.

You got it.

- Enjoy your day.

- Thanks, thanks, thanks.

- I want... that. That, that, that. Thanks.

- Of course. Yeah.

And I'll take the raspberry croissants.

- Here you go.

- Thanks. Thanks.

Have a nice day.

Have a blessed day, sir.

Thank you so much.

Okay. Yeah. Let's get it packed up.

Okay. Let's go. Show me the books.

Watch. Watch this. Watch. Watch.

Watch, watch, watch. Watch. Watch!

Stop!

Ooh, spider. Let's see if it farts.

Oh, fuck.

I would have worn gloves if I knew there was bedbugs.

What?

I would have worn gloves if you told me there was bedbugs.

Well, the purple looks nice.

- Yeah.

- How much did that put you back?

Well, Narek spent about 20k on it.

You can't afford an exterminator?

I don't know.

Hey. Hey.

Uh, you should be using longer strips.

It works better.

- Whatcha doing?

- Top secret.

- Really?

- Guys, I need you outta here.

- You guys are boring anyway.

- Yeah, I know.

Catch ya later.

Fuck.

Shit.

- Guys, share.

Share. Come on. Let her play it one time.

- You gotta...

- Help her though.

- Let me help.

- No, hold on.

- Let her figure it out.

- No, stop.

Scooty, let her figure it out.

No. she gotta play that game that we were playing. That...

No, I don't.

No, she doesn't.

Let her do whatever she wants.

Thanks for calling The Magic Castle.

It's Amber.

Yeah. We sure do.

Thirty-eight dollars a night.

Well, we're here all night.

Yeah.

All righty. Thanks a lot.

- I warned ya, one drip and you're out.

- Oh, come on!

- Out, now.

- It's gonna melt outside.

Obviously, it's melting inside, too.

- But, Bobby...

- Out.

Thank you very much.

You're not welcome!

Bobby could be such a shitty.

True.

Gloria!

I wanna knock, I wanna knock,

- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Whoa!

One light knock will do, guys.

I see her!

Come on, Jancey, come on!

Remember last time, she fell in the pool 'cause she was dancing?

Come on, Scooty!

Come on!

Come on Moonee, come on!

Boobies. Boobies.

Banana boobs, banana boobs, banana boobs.

Oh, no!

Get down. Scooty.

Gloria.

We talked about this before. Cover up.

- Cover what up?

- You know what I'm talking about.

- I do not know.

- These kids don't need...

- What kids are here? There's no kids here.

- Kids are right over there.

- Oh. They should be in school, kids.

- It's summer break.

- Did he catch us?

- I think he did.

Can you read? What's that say?

- "Pool rules."

- No, the other one.

- Oh. No tits allowed. No, what?

- No alcoholic beverages in pool area.

Okay, I'll do that, but I still wanna go topless with my big titties.

Gloria.

I think she's having a talk with him.

Let me go look, guys. Get down.

No, I will... I'll go.

You're a beautiful woman...

Oh, no. Bobby's gonna make her...

- Just put them away. Cover them up.

- Cover the fuck up, you cover yourself up.

Does this happen all the time?

Yep. And it's great.

- This is what you gotta do.

- Ah!

- Hey! Uh-oh.

- That's the way it works here.

Uh-oh, he's about... Call the sheriff.

- He just touched my tit.

- Bobby!

Bobby, boobies.

- Go back to your room. Go.

- He molested me, Officer.

I'm gonna sue this fucking motel, with this fucking pervert that just touched my fucking titties.

Hey, Gloria, rub 'em.

- Rub your boobs on his face so he can ge...

- Get the hell outta here!

Kids, out.

Stop!

Uh, Patrice?

Uh... Keep an eye on 151. There's been traffic in and out of there all day.

- Really?

- Okay, okay.

I'll take care of it in the morning.

- I can't whistle.

- You can't whistle?

You're going to have to train him, Bobby.

Stop it!

Time to go.

Come on. Let's go.

What the fuck is you talking about?

I paid my room for a week now.

I'm not leaving the property.

I don't care.

- You're breaking the rules.

- Nobody's breaking rules.

What are you talking about?

How would you like it if I called the sheriff's office?

Oh, yeah?

- You're gonna call the sheriff's office?

- Then we can figure things out.

- Oh, really? Really?

- Your man knows what the story is.

Mom, can we get this one?

No, we're gonna gotta get the fugazi ones.

We have to look at these boxes, okay?

If I buy more than 20, can you give me a discount?

This is wholesale.

Mom, what about this one?

You can smell like Justin Bieber.

Hey, hey. We're selling perfume.

- Yeah, this one.

- No, listen...

It'll make your wife smell really good.

- You have Jimmy Choo?

- Yeah, it's amazing. It's only $20.

They're so much more expensive in the store, it's a really good deal.

- Do you wanna buy some perfume?

- Ma'am?

- Do you wanna buy some perfume?

- Not really. She might.

No? It smells like designer.

We're having a really good deal.

Yeah.

- This one...

- Would you like to buy some perfume?

Yeah. This one will make all the girls flirt on you.

I have samples if you wanna try some, but we have a whole bunch of different ones.

Thank you so much. Appreciate it.

- Yes!

- Girl! Woot, woot!

Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Seriously, if you're gonna be late again, you gotta let me know.

- It was due yesterday.

- Yeah, that's right. It was due yesterday.

Whatevs. Why you gotta count it, like I'm broke?

- I just gotta make sure.

- Gotta make sure what?

It's the right amount.

It's a simple thing.

I just counted it. I can't count?

You think I can't count?

Listen. Honey. Honey. I trust you.

- Do you?

- Yep. Uh...

So then put that in your...

May I count it?

May I count it?

Good girl, you got your rent.

Let me count it. Get outta here.

- Bye.

- Bye.

Dicky! You wanna say bye to your room?

- Nah.

- You good?

That's right, player.

That's right. Awesome.

Hey, Dicky, I can't take this.

Look, there's no room in here at all.

I'm gonna buy you new toys when we get to New Orleans, okay? I promise.

Come on, guys. Take whatever you want.

Grab whatever you want out of there.

- Here you go, guys.

- I got the gun.

- Dad! Please.

- Here, here, here.

All new stuff, kid. All new stuff.

- Just imagine, all new stuff.

- Fine.

My mom said, "Have fun."

All right guys. Here.

You can have the whole box.

Take the whole box with you, go ahead.

Bye, Joyce. Bye.

Yo, T. Take care, bro, all right?

You hold this place down for me while I'm gone, you hear?

- You be good, okay sweetie?

- Okay.

- Bye Dicky!

- See you later!

- Hey, you wanna see something cool?

- Yeah.

- Okay. Make sure you don't tell anyone.

- Okay.

Look. And it has a naked girl on it.

Did you steal that?

Moon, Scoot!

Yeah, Mom?

Get off your butts and go get some waffles.

- My mom wanted extra maple syrup.

- It's in there.

- Okay, guys, go. Have fun, be careful.

- Okay.

Hey, Scooty, it's actually for me.

- What are you, twerking over here?

- Yeah.

- Let me see. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

- Mommy. Mom... Mommy.

Oh, wow. You got some twerk skills, girl.

- Yass!

- Now watch me shake my booty.

Now watch me shake my booty.

Yo, you heard this song, bitch?

It's mad lit.

Wait. Hold up. Wait. Bitch, did that guy from OBT ever call you?

- Yeah.

- What's good with that?

He's mad fucking whack.

I tried to chill with him.

He doesn't like kids.

Oh. Goodbye. Good night.

Take several seats.

- Who you telling?

- Face it.

Yo, by the way, you gotta do me a fucking favor.

Next time Moonee comes to you to get food, don't give her no fucking maple syrup.

This bitch has been farting...

Good night, bitch. I love you!

Love you. Night, bitch.

I'm gonna kiss it.

Can I have a bite on the ice cream then?

Pretty good.

Hey, kids! How many times have I told you that you can't be hanging out there?

We're paying customers.

I don't care.

You can't be bothering my customers.

- Go. Get out.

- No. You don't tell us what to do.

Hey!

- Yeah, lady!

- Be quiet!

Hey. Hey, girls, come on.

- We're hiding! This is serious, Bobby.

- I'm working.

We need to hide, we need to hide.

We need to hide. Go, go, go, go.

No, not back...

- We don't care.

- Now be quiet.

And watch those wires down there.

Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Watch the wires down there, girls!

No, no, no, no.

Have you seen Moon... Yes!

Don't blow our cover.

Where's Moonee and Jancey?

I got you! I got you!

I got you! I got you guys!

- Move, Bobby!

- Excuse me.

Have a safe trip!

Hallelujah!

Hallelujah! Thank you, Lord Jesus!

No boys allowed!

No!

No boys!

Do that one more time, and...

Hi, kids.

- Okay! I'm gonna...

- Hey! Go ahead.

You having fun?

This is the girl's table.

- Fuck! Shit! What the fuck?

- I'm sorry, buddy.

- It was an accident.

- You almost hit me.

- I...

- Fuck, man.

- Okay. I'm sorry, man.

- Punk ass bitch.

Ah. What's your name?

Excuse me, can I help you?

- Uh... No, that's okay.

- What's okay?

Moonee, get off that picnic table.

People eat on that thing. Come on, girl.

You're a guest here?

Uh. No... I'm looking for... a soda machine.

You come to a motel to get a soda?

Yeah. Uh... It's okay...

- I appreciate it.

- No. Come on, come with me.

Come with me.

I know where there's a soda machine.

- No, no.

- Just come with me.

You want a soda, right?

Yeah, yeah. I was passing by on the highway...

Get off that picnic table!

- I was just passing by...

- Yeah?

And, and I wanted to get a soda

'cause uh... I needed a soda.

You were parched, huh?

- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

- You wanted to wet that palate, right?

Yeah. I never did get used to the humidity here.

It's okay. Uh... The machine's up there.

- So you like soda, huh?

- Uh, yeah, yeah. It's good.

You know, I read in a magazine that soda's not so good for quenching your thirst.

- I agree. Yeah. Yeah.

- You noticed that? You know what's better?

- What?

- Tea.

- T-Tea?

- Tea. Hot tea.

- Hot tea. Like...

- Yeah, yeah, I drink that.

- You do? Okay.

- Yeah. Yeah.

No, no. It's... It's right up here.

Just a little more ways.

You came for a soda, we're gonna get you a soda. Right?

Yeah, but I-I... I wanted to...

I-I had to have a walk.

Yeah, well, you're gettin' a walk.

It's right up here. You'll get your soda.

And you can have a walk.

What a choice.

- Okay, thank you.

- Hey.

- I thought you were thirsty.

- Yeah.

Aren't you gonna drink it now?

Yeah. Yes.

Good?

Sure.

Get the fuck outta here.

You come on this property again, and you won't be leaving it. You understand?

I don't know what you're talking about.

You don't know what I'm talking about?

You gonna play it that way, huh?

Hey.

- Hey!

- All right.

Charlie Coachman... of Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

You can't keep that, that's my license.

I'm gonna call your name in to the county sheriff.

Now you get the fuck outta here!

Get going. Get going!

Don't you stop!

I'm making a sand castle.

- Excuse me, do you wanna buy some perfume?

- I'm sorry?

Do you wanna buy some perfume?

- We're selling perfume.

- I don't have cash on me.

Okay. Thank you.

- No, thank you.

- This will make you handsome!

Come on. Actually... Actually, sir?

Can you just give us a couple bucks?

Just for me and my kid, if you're not gonna buy the perfume?

- Look...

- Please.

- Have a great day.

- Thank you so much!

Yass!

Let your head back.

Let your head back.

- Do you want to get splashed?

- No. No. No!

Jancey. This is gonna be scary.

Yeah!

There's ghosts in there.

- Are we going in there?

- No. You'll see.

- It's spooky.

- Spooky.

- Hey, you wanna see a joke?

- What?

- Ready?

- Voilà!

Wait for me, guys.

What a gentleman you are.

Yeah.

Scooty, will you marry me?

Well... Not right now.

- You may kiss the bride.

- I said not right now! Ew.

- What is this place?

- The "abandids".

One... Two... Three!

Hey, you know there's alligators in there?

Really?

Look, if I had a pet alligator,

I would name mine Anne.

Ha. Ooh, look, a pillow!

Cool.

I bet this house was built hundreds of years ago.

Oh! This could be a dance room!

Party with beer.

Party with beer.

Party with beer.

Party with beer!

Oh, my gosh! Come here Jancey!

Ghost poop.

Yeah!

This would be my bed.

And that would be my bookshelf.

No. Actually, my bed would be right in the middle. And lots of toys!

Scooty!

- What are you breaking?

- The wall.

Good luck!

Woo-hoo!

Oh. The fireplace.

I have the best idea.

Scooty! We need your lighter!

- Push it in.

- This is going to be the best fire ever.

- Light it up, Scooty!

- Yeah. Light it up!

Whoa, guys. Whoa. Whoa.

- We're gonna be in so much trouble.

- No!

Um, just... Jancey, go home. Bye.

Don't tell anyone.

Don't tell your grandma.

- Okay. Bye. Bye.

- Okay.

- Don't tell anyone!

- Okay!

- Scooty, don't tell your mom, okay?

- Okay.

Excuse me.

Moon, the old condos are on fire.

You wanna go check them out?

Scooty, come on.

Don't you wanna see the burning house?

No. I just wanna stay here and watch TV.

- Scooty?

- Hurry up, bitch.

I don't wanna miss this.

- I'll meet you there.

- Hurry up, bitch.

Look at me.

You tell me the truth right now.

Do you understand what will happen to us if you did this?

Do you want the fucking DCF down here, Scooty?

- You need to tell me the truth right now.

- I didn't do it.

Don't lie to me. Please don't lie to me.

This isn't a game, Scooty. This is not a joke right now. I need to know.

- Hey, girl!

- Hi!

Aren't you excited?

This is so much better than TV.

Can I take a picture of you?

I wanna send it to Ashley.

Stand right there.

Smile, girlfriend.

It used to be a big crackhead spot.

Prostituting and all that.

Let it burn. Let it burn.

You got another one of those?

For you?

- Here, babe.

- Thanks.

- You just like me for my cigarettes now.

- No.

That's right.

- You wouldn't have even said hello...

- That's not so.

- ...if I didn't have cigarettes.

- That's not true.

No wonder I don't like you.

Could've been arson.

- Could've been.

- I don't know.

They were so fucking ugly,

I was thinking of burning them down.

Ashley?

- Hi, Miss Ashley. Is Scooty here?

- Moonee, tell your mom no more food. Okay?

- Okay. Is...

- I have to go work, okay?

- Is Scooty here?

- No, he's not.

- Well, he's not at home.

- Yeah, I know. He's with my friends.

Well, could you please give me the address?

Look, you can't come around anymore.

And I don't want you hanging out with Scooty anymore, you got it?

I have to go.

Yass!

Hey, do you fucking see this shit?

Come on. Come on.

God!

World star!

How 'bout this?

No more letting people run over other people in the fucking parking lot.

How 'bout that?

- Bobby, I didn't... I couldn't do anything.

- What's wrong with you?

'Cause this, this can't be happening.

I fucking knocked that little fucker out. You fucking kiddin' me?

Go run and get some waffles, baby.

And where the fuck is Scooty?

- Yo.

- Hi, Scooty.

Hi, Halley.

Moonee's gonna hit the pool, does Scooty wanna come with her?

Ashley doesn't think that's a good idea right now, sorry.

The fuck does that mean?

Halley, calm down, calm down.

Hi. Here you go.

I want her to take my order.

Oh, it's you.

Never seen you inside before.

Okay. Hold on.

Ashley.

- Yeah?

- Yeah?

- What do you want, Halley?

- What's going on?

What do you mean?

You've been telling my daughter she ain't welcome here no more.

Look, she can come in here, but I can't keep giving out free food.

Shit. You got in trouble?

And I don't want Scooty hanging out with her or that new kid from FutureLand.

Okay. So you ain't get in trouble.

What's going on?

Nothing. Nothing to discuss.

- Really?

- Really.

Yo! What type of service is that?

You gonna come take my order?

Moonee, order whatever the fuck you want.

We're staying here all fucking day.

Yes. I want strawberry waffles with extra, extra warm syrup.

And I want eggs, bacon, and strawberries.

And blueberries. And Coke, root beer, and lemonade. Sprite.

You?

You sure that's it? You could order more.

I told you, anything you want.

I actually want extra bacon.

Lots of bacon.

- And fresh jelly. Don't forget that.

- You got all that?

You got money to pay for this?

Don't worry about my pockets. I got money.

- Okay.

- And I got money, too!

I have an idea.

You wanna have a burping contest?

- Are you serious?

- I know you wanna have a burping contest.

- You go first.

- Okay.

That was a good one.

- You got another one?

- Yeah.

Here it goes, here it goes...

- Oh, my God.

- You try to burp.

I want the rest to go.

You gonna pack this up for me, or do I gotta tell Simone what I feel about the service here?

Yeah.

Say hi to Scooty for me.

Mom, why did you do that?

Ah! I told you, you gotta spin it.

- I am.

- No, no. Clockwise.

- I am! This is clockwise.

- Oh, oh.

- No. I guess counterclockwise.

- Jesus.

Come on.

Pull, pull, pull.

- You gotta spin it.

- I am.

By the way,

I told her happy birthday for you.

- But I didn't.

- Come on, push.

- But I didn't. I didn't.

- Push.

Why'd you do that? Why would you do that?

Now you call her and tell her I didn't.

Come on, please.

Hey. First...

First, you get her on the phone, and you tell her

I didn't wish her anything, damn it.

Okay.

You know what? Keep the money.

- Keep it.

- No.

- I thought you appreciated the extra work.

- Okay.

No. It takes an hour and a half just to drive here.

You totally screwed up my Saturday.

I don't need the extra work.

Give the money to him, he needs it.

Or tell your boss to hire an extra hand.

Please just take the money.

I really don't need it.

I can't do this anymore. I'm done.

Okay. But, just... help me bring this downstairs.

Come on. Finish what you started.

- You gonna press the button?

- Oh, yeah.

Fuck.

This one smells really good.

- No.

- No?

No. Thank you.

Okay, thank you.

- Hey! Hey!

- Oh, fuck.

Excuse me, lady. Hey!

- Hey!

- We're leaving.

- I need you guys to come back inside.

- We're leaving.

- Do you hear me?

- We're leaving.

Come on.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

You were soliciting in our building.

- You can't do that.

- You're not even a real cop.

Hey, I'm just doing my job here, alright.

You can't do that on our property.

I've already called the cops.

You gotta go back inside with me.

Get off your power trip.

You're riding a golf cart, okay?

I need you to come back right now.

If you're leaving,

I gotta confiscate that.

I need you to... Gimme...

- Fuck!

- Are you serious right now?

You fucking bitch!

Come back here!

Why'd you let her have our perfume?

It's complicated, baby.

But why?

I can't get arrested again.

Could we go for ice cream?

You're walking too fast.

I don't wanna watch this anymore.

- Where's the iPad?

- Sold.

- What?

- I had to sell it.

- Why?

- Whatever, Moonee, this room costs money.

- You know I like pepperoni.

- Pepperoni costs money.

Don't wipe that on the sheets.

Gotta sleep there.

This is my pillow.

I can wipe my hands on my pillow.

Are you gonna wash it then?

I'll have Bertha wash it.

I'm not gonna explain it to you again.

I ain't gonna let you, or anyone else, establish residency.

Don't think I think you're as dumb as you want me to think.

You're gonna screw me over.

You don't wanna do this, you can go.

I'm serious.

But who's gonna know if we even did this?

And I'm being straight with you.

You gotta settle up by Friday.

Come on.

Hey, April.

Come on, Moonee.

- What are you taking pictures for?

- New policy.

Narek wants me to document the vacancy.

Moonee, come on.

Good night, ladies. See you in 24 hours.

I'm right across 192 at The Magic Castle.

I come here once a month, and the rate's 35.

Yes, well, our policy has changed.

- You can't just change the policy.

- I certainly can.

- Fuck this right now.

- What are you doing?

Don't worry about me.

- Who are you calling?

- Mind your business.

- Can't you see I'm in charge here?

- I don't care.

- Hello. Bobby.

- Hey, Bobby.

These fuckos at The Arabian are trying to charge me...

- Forty-five.

- Forty-five bucks.

Can you tell them it's 35?

- Now that's not right.

- Hey, listen, Bobby...

- Where's Jimmy?

- It's me, Jimmy, Bobby.

We're not honoring the deal anymore.

- Hey, Jimmy, How's it going?

- Yeah, good.

- Hello?

- Uh, who is this?

Any arrangements or deals you had with the previous owner...

Give us a break, lady!

...are no longer being honored or recognized. Thank you.

We've had an agreement in place for a while where we give a little break to each other's...

I'm well aware of the arrangement you used to have.

But as I have said five times now, this is no longer being honored.

We just went through with this whole thing with The Enchanted Inn.

- Look, can't you make an exception?

- No.

This is not up for discussion.

You see what I'm saying, Bobby?

Duh, lady! Duh!

Magic Castle discount, there you go.

- Excuse me.

- Aw, you're so sweet, Bobby.

We don't need your business.

Please take your money.

- What?

- All of you kindly leave, please.

- Thank you.

- You can't do that.

I have the 45. Are you fucking serious?

Listen to you. And your child.

No wonder you're in this situation.

Please leave the property.

Right now. Leave.

- What is wrong with you?

- Hey, come on.

Are you crazy out of mind?

You better come back here and clean this up. Come back here.

Fuck you.

Do not ever come back to this property!

Damn, girl.

This shit looks fucking fancy in here.

Thank you, thank you.

How do you got it like that?

You an interior decorator or some shit?

Shit is mad cozy.

- Guys, you want cheesies?

- Yeah.

- Yeah?

- What's that big thing over there?

That's a turkey roaster.

What the fuck is it,

Thanksgiving over here?

You got some cranberry sauce too? Shit.

I make some things, but Lunchables are like one dollar, you know?

Grandma, can they sleep over here every night?

- Yeah. You trying to cook us dinner.

- Oh, I don't know about every night.

- Why not?

- We can sleep together like a big family.

Yeah!

I'll pull out a mattress on the floor or something like that, but y'all ain't sleeping in my bed.

No, you sleep on this side.

And I'll sleep on that side.

This is gonna be the funnest sleepover over.

Yeah!

Since it's bedtime, can we finally go fucking smoke a blunt outside?

Can you tie me up?

Are we going swimming?

- No, we're gonna take swimsuit selfies.

- Swimsuit selfies!

Okay, ready? Let's take a selfie.

Stick your tongue out.

Cute.

Tell me how to look pretty, Moonee.

Wait. Hold on.

My turn!

Get out there and take a picture of me.

Perfect.

Plip, plop, plip, plop.

It's going to be a big surprise! And...

- Open!

- Whoa!

At the end of the rainbow is gold!

I know, but a leprechaun is on the end with the gold.

And it wouldn't let us keep it.

I wish that leprechaun was nice.

Let's go beat it up. Come on!

Hey. This Slinky is old.

Hip-hop.

That's the way we do it.

Power 95.3, Orlando's number one for commercial free hip-hop.

Sorry to interrupt.

I just wanted to pay you for the week, sir.

- It's good.

- Duh.

- Hi!

- Hi, Bobby!

Hi, bossy guy.

Good kids. Most of the time.

- Bobby.

- Yeah.

- Come here.

- Yup.

Okay. See? This is all finable.

- What?

- These bikes blocking the walkway.

Okay. Okay.

- You have to make a flyer.

- All right.

It has to say, "Please move your bikes and lock them in the back."

Okay. Uh, in the...

- Okay?

- Way in the back?

- Yes.

- Okay.

Give them one week deadline, otherwise we'll cut them off.

- Okay. All right.

- "Thank you, Management."

Soap in my eyes.

Let me wash my hair again without this soap in my eye.

I'm gonna cook lasagne!

- What are you gonna cook?

- I'm gonna cook alien food!

Yeah!

Here you go, aliens! Eat it up!

You're a good hummer, Jancey.

Oh, wait.

- Mommy, look at us.

- Girls, we got one.

Yes!

We're just going straight. Is that okay?

- You ready, Jancey?

- Can I put it in?

- It's on.

- Be careful, 'cause it has fire.

Don't want you to get burned.

Make a wish, big girl.

- Happy birthday, Jancey!

- Whoa!

- That's for you.

- I love it!

Halley, save us, 'cause I don't...

- Did you make your birthday wish?

- Yeah.

Okay.

- Oh, come on.

- Hola.

Come on. Pardon me.

Excuse me. Pardon me.

- Excuse me, pardon me.

- Gracias.

- Come on, ladies.

- Excuse me, dude.

- Get it, get it, get it.

- It's hard, Moonee.

- What?

- It's really hard, Moonee.

- Yeah, I know.

- Hey. Wait a minute.

I didn't get jelly.

Tricky jar.

- Tricky, tricky. Tricky, tricky...

- Tricky jar.

- Wiggly, wiggly.

- Well, here you go.

- Oh, no.

- Oh.

Thank you!

Kind of like that, don't ya?

This is the best jelly I ever eaten.

Do you know... Do you know why this is my favorite tree?

Why?

'Cause it tipped over.

And it's still growing.

That's pretty cool.

All yours, Scooty.

- Hey, Bobby.

- Hey.

Ashley, have you been spotting Halley on the rent?

What? Why would I do that?

I don't even talk to that bitch.

- Okay. Thanks. Have a nice swim.

- Thank you.

Can I go swimming with Scooty?

You're not going swimming while that bitch is down there.

Why can't I?

Tickle monster.

Moonee, get ready for a bath, okay?

What kind of car you driving?

All right. Room 323, babe.

Oh. Hey, there's a kid in here.

Dude, I told you the bathroom was off-limits.

- I had to piss.

- Out.

- Pull the curtain, Moon.

- You have a fucking kid in here?

Whatever. Out.

Moon, I'll be right back, okay?

...Orlando's number one for commercial free hip-hop.

Do I look like a ticket scammer?

I don't know.

What does a ticket scammer look like?

- I'm just not interested.

- Not like me, though.

If I was scamming tickets,

I would not be coming in here with my daughter, trying to give you a deal.

- Hey, you going in there?

- Yeah.

Don't buy from those places.

They'll rope you into buying timeshares.

- I got some I'm trying to sell.

- Ah. No, thanks.

Dude! They'll make you do a two-hour tour and hard sell you.

You really wanna do that shit on your vacation?

You're selling ticket bands?

Well, I have four. They're 164 per day.

So that's, like, $600 in cash.

I could do... $400.

And these still work, no tricks?

They're completely unused.

My family had to cancel our vacation, and they don't give out refunds.

But they're totally unused, they'll work.

Look, I'll even come with you to the front gate or whatever so you know I'm for real.

- And these are Park Hoppers, yeah?

- Of course!

All right. Should we say

350 for the four, then?

- Cash?

- Yeah.

Lowest I can do is 400. That's a steal.

- All right.

- Thanks.

Give him the bands, Moon.

Give the man the bands.

- Have a great time.

- Thanks, sweetheart.

Thank you. Come on, baby.

Oh, look, look.

That one's beautiful!

I want that one.

- We can give Jancey one.

- Let's buy it. Give me that.

- Look at what else they have.

- Hey!

- Cotton balls?

- Yeah.

Okay.

Toys!

Seriously, girlfriend?

- Money. I'm rich. I'm rich.

- You got money!

Look, there's a flute!

Yeah!

- Back in the workforce?

- Say what?

- New job?

- Yeah!

Interesting hours.

What?

One, I see you dressed in PJs all day, every day.

Am I wearing PJs now?

Two, if you're working, who's looking after Moonee?

Mind your own business, bro.

Get that stolen cart off the property.

Yeah?

Who is it?

Go away, asshole, or I'm gonna call the cops.

Why you calling the cops?

I'm not going away.

Mom, who's outside?

Nobody, baby. Don't worry about it.

Hey, hey!

- Hey, what's going on?

- It's none of your business, bro.

It is my business. I'm the manager here.

What's going on?

Okay, yeah. The girl in there, she's got something of mine.

I... I want it back.

- The six-year-old?

- The...

No, man. The mom.

Halley, it's Bobby.

We got a situation here. Open up.

- Yeah?

- This guy says you have something of his.

- I don't know who this guy is.

- She doesn't know who you are.

You got the wrong girl.

We gotta talk, now.

You know, you gotta leave the premises if you're not staying here.

I'm not going anywhere without my four MagicBands, okay?

She went in my bag, she took four fucking MagicBands.

What the fuck is a magical band?

I don't know what this guy is talking about.

She don't know what you're talking about.

She went in my stuff, she lifted four fucking bands.

- I don't know what you're talking about.

- She don't know what you're talking...

You do know what I'm talking about.

Okay? I want them back now. That's $1700.

That's grand larceny, bitch.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, buddy.

I'm happy to call the cops right now, and we can fill out a report.

And you can tell them what your business was on the premises.

Four bracelets?

I imagine they were for your wife and children, yeah?

I suggest you leave the premises right now.

This isn't a premises, it's a fucking dump.

About time you make yourself useful.

Did he have to pee again?

Don't worry about it, Moon.

What now?

From now on, all visitors are required to check in at the front desk. Got it?

What?

You have a guest, they check in with me at the front office.

- What the fuck are you talking about?

- You heard me.

Get back inside, Moonee.

When I say register, I'm talking about ID.

They gotta leave the ID right there, with me, in the office.

You can't just not let me have guests.

What gives you the authority?

What? The authority?

Uh, my job title: Manager.

- I have friends though.

- Hey, watch those glasses on the walkway.

Yeah. We all got friends.

We all got friends.

But this is a special rule for you.

Okay. But, Bobby...

I do follow rules. Just 'cause they're not your rules doesn't mean anything.

No, they... They're the company's rules.

They're the motel's rules.

- That's the way it is. I'm a very fair...

- Fuck you looking at, Tina?

- Hey!

- Don't listen, don't...

- Hey, people are leaving.

- You're not my fucking father.

- I don't wanna be your father.

- You can't fucking treat me like this.

- This isn't a fucking jail.

- Listen... Hey! Calm down!

- Calm down!

- This isn't a jail!

- No, no. It's a place where people live.

- You're gonna chase my friends away?

- And you gotta... You gotta calm down.

- That's a fucking invasion of privacy.

It's like the fucking

Fifth Amendment or something.

- I've had it. That's it! That's it!

- You can't fucking do that.

- That's it!

- Who do you think you are, Bobby Big Shot?

Fuck you, Bobby!

I don't have to listen to you!

Out!

I want you out of this lobby!

I'm gonna count to three.

And if you don't leave this lobby, you're out of here tonight!

One.

Two.

Three!

Oh. Nice!

Moonee, why'd you take me on this adventure?

- I didn't know it was going to rain.

- Did you not even watch the news?

I never watch the news. It's so boring!

I watch the news. It's not that boring.

Careful of the pooey.

See, I took you on a safari.

Hey. These two are still busted, but I'll be done with that one in like two minutes.

Okay.

Mom, it's Halley.

- Hey.

- What?

I know Moonee probably did some shit, and I'm sorry about that.

But I don't think that shit should, you know, affect us.

You know, they're kids.

Is that it?

Yeah, well...

Could you spot me my rent this week?

I'm maxed out.

What?

I think you got that covered.

What are you talking about?

You don't think everybody knows what's up, Halley? Like, everybody.

What the fuck are you talking about?

Bitch...

Seems pretty clear to me.

Step aside, soldier!

- That's you.

- That's not me.

Those are your tats, bitch.

Are you fucking kidding me?

And I swear to God, if Scooty was ever in the room while you were whoring off,

I'll fucking kill you.

- Fuck you, bitch!

- No!

Get the fuck outta here.

Mom, are you okay?

Mom?

Uh, are you okay, Mom?

You're not going to like it.

Because guess what?

- What?

- No fun stuff in the classroom.

I heard in school you get recess.

And recess is fun. You get to go outside, you get on the playground, it's fun.

It's just recess! Nothing else!

Well, my grandma sometimes does that to me, but I trick her that I fall asleep.

- But then I just wake up...

- I think something's happening at my room.

Did Ashley fucking call DCF on me?

Ma'am, we got a call, and it doesn't matter who...

From who? Who the fuck called you then?

- Ma'am...

- Who called you?

- We were called to investigate.

- Who called you?

You fucking tell me who called, and I'll tell you why.

If it was Ashley, she's hype

'cause I fucking beat her ass.

Girls.

Don't fucking touch me.

Don't ask me questions.

- I don't fucking want...

- Listen to me.

- You wait right here, okay?

- Why is my mom yelling?

Uh, she's just talking to these ladies.

Jancey, you go home.

- You go home now.

- Okay.

- Bye, Moonee.

- Bye.

You're not coming into my fucking place.

I'm not doing anything wrong.

You're literally coming onto my fucking property.

You're not coming into my room.

You don't have a fucking court order.

Let me see paperwork.

So then can you help us so that we can go...

Can I help you about what?

Why's my mom upset?

You know, I don't know, but, uh...

They're just talking.

They gotta figure something out.

What are... What do they have to figure anything out with?

Um, I don't know. It's some sort of confusion. But it'll be fine. Okay?

- Mom!

- Uh...

You're doing this in front of my fucking kid?

Can I go back to my room now?

In a little bit.

- A couple minutes, okay?

- Yup.

Just... Just... Moonee.

Talk to the lady.

She's just got some questions for you, and then you can go back to your room.

All right?

Can you tell me what kind of stuff you do every day, Moonee?

Do you ever go swimming in the pool?

Yeah?

What else? What kind of stuff do you like to do with your friends?

What's going on?

Nothing, baby. Go back to bed.

- Whatcha doin' all wet, Mom?

- Nothing.

Come here.

Tag, you're it.

It's very good.

Tickle monster!

I'm the tickle monster!

If there are any boxes over there that are less than half-full, throw them out, okay?

Yeah, yeah.

Girl, those are from the outside.

Your grubby little fingers trying to unlock this window.

You better clean that.

Don't do that, don't do that.

If DCF has a fucking problem with that, eff them.

What?

Dirty.

You better clean up those underpants.

Thank you.

- Hey!

- Hey.

- What's up?

- You need towels?

No.

- Hmm. Sometime, a little bit.

- I have a present for you.

This is for you, but make sure you smoke all of it.

- Like, all of it.

- Yes.

- Thank you.

- You're welcome.

Enjoy that shit, girl.

Thank you. Hey!

And don't worry. It's gonna be okay.

I promise. It's gonna be okay.

- I don't know why we just, like...

- Just look at them.

Okay.

What's your...

What's your favorite thing to watch on TV?

Boys. Good morning.

Yeah. You gotta go home.

There's cars coming through here.

We got guests.

No harm, no foul.

"No foul."

There's a joke in there somewhere.

All right, fellas.

All right. Have a good day.

Wow!

- Moonee, come get a plate.

- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Mm... Good.

I'm going to eat a strawberry and a raspberry at the same time.

Man, oh, man, that's gross.

I wish they made forks out of candy.

Then you could eat the fork after your meal.

I love this.

Oh, I feel like I'm going to burp.

Wish I had a bigger stomach.

Like I was pregnant.

I'd fit food in there.

We gotta come here again.

This is the life, man.

Better than a cruise.

I mean, there's...

There's not a cruise made out of all this food.

- Excuse me.

- Yeah.

May I have your room number, please?

- 323.

- Thank you. Have a great stay.

Excuse me, can I have your room number, please?

Hi, there. I need to speak with the manager, please.

Bobby...

I know.

Mom, what's going on?

- It's okay, baby.

- What's okay?

That's actually what we have in our paperwork.

Oh, okay.

- Excuse me.

- Hi, Halley.

- Thank you.

- Hi, Moonee.

Can I help you?

Halley, these DCF officers are here in regards to Moonee.

You wanna inspect my room, be my guest.

You wanna shake my boxes?

You wanna look inside my fridge?

- Halley.

- What?

We have security footage showing nine different men entering and eXiting your room.

Why don't you take Moonee outside so we can talk to Halley privately?

- What's going on?

- Um...

Well, you know what? We just wanna make sure that you're safe, okay?

We've also obtained this online classified ad soliciting customers for sexual activities with your phone number attached.

Well, you're gonna go somewhere really fun, and we're gonna have toys...

But how many days?

- It'll only be temporary, okay?

- What's temporary?

Temporary means just for a little bit of time.

- Can we do that?

- I guess so.

Okay. Thank you. You're such a big girl.

You know that?

No.

...that's able to take her. But luckily, we have a family in Polk County that can take her for the entire course of the investigation. Okay?

Could I say goodbye to my friend Scooty?

- Uh...

- He's down in 223.

We just need to check to see if that's okay.

She wants to say goodbye to her friend Scooty.

- It's okay for her to say goodbye, right?

- I'll take her down.

We don't say goodbye.

But you could give your friend a hug.

And you'll see them real soon. Okay?

- Okay.

- Okay. Let's go. Come on.

My colleague's gonna take Moonee downstairs to say goodbye to her friend.

And in the meantime, it'd be great if you could pack a bag with necessities.

Also, maybe a favorite doll or toy.

Yes?

Hello, miss. My name is Susan Watson.

I'm with DCF.

We have a quick favor to ask...

Ashley, what happened to your face?

...little cinnamon on it. The right temperature, take your breath away.

Okay. We can do a hug or a high-five.

- Come here, Moonee.

- Thank you so much.

- I hope your eye feels better.

- Thank you, babe.

All right. Thank you so much. Okay?

My mom said you're going to another family.

- Scooty.

- What?

Thank you.

Why did he say

I was going to another family?

You're just gonna go live with a family just for a little while.

- Just temporary, okay?

- Moonee, we're going to your room, okay?

Okay.

Watch the steps.

Are those cops going to take my mom away?

- No, they're not.

- Are they gonna take me to another family?

I'm gonna take you to a nice family where you're gonna be okay, just for a little while. Is that okay?

- Well, I don't want to.

- Moonee.

- I don't want to go.

- Moonee, I know.

- Moonee, will you please listen?

- Stop.

- Honey, your mom knows all about it.

- Stop!

Your mom said it was okay.

- Do you want me to get super angry?

- No, I don't. That's why...

Hey, I'm gonna... fix those machines by the end of the week.

Okay.

- Would you please go get her parent?

- Yes, okay.

- Stop!

- Honey, honey. She's gonna... Calm down.

- Halley?

- Jesus Christ!

- Sweetie, come on...

- You are... I'm not your sweetie!

Being very emotional right now.

You want me to help you take my child away?

- I am so sor...

- Are you retarded? You're stupid, right?

- I don't have to go.

- Take a breath. Sweetie.

You're literally asking me to help you take away my fucking kid!

- This is what's best right now.

- Halley, calm down.

Calm down? Calm down?

You want me to fuckin' help, right?

You want me to fuckin' help, right?

- Get the fuck outta my house!

- Hey, calm down.

Stop! You're such a liar!

You're such a liar!

You're a fucking... Don't touch me!

- Stop.

- She just went to get your mom.

You have to stop!

I don't wanna go!

- Liar!

- Moonee!

Shut the fuck up! Don't touch...

Moonee!

Moonee! Oh, my God. Officer!

...fuck outta here!

Get the fuck outta here!

Officer!

- I don't care!

- The child's running!

No! No. That way. Towards the highway!

- 81, I got a child running eastbound...

- What's going on?

I don't know. Just...

- DCF...

- Jesus Christ.

I tried to hold her.

You let her just run away?

- Halley, will you please just...

- And I'm the one who's unfit?

Fuck you!

Jancey!

Hi, Moonee.

Here you go, honey.

Jancey. Come, honey. It's time to eat.

We're just about to have lunch, are you hungry?

Moonee, you want a bowl, honey?

Moonee, what's wrong?

Lucy! Por favor, look at this!

Please!

You're scaring me, Moonee.

You're my best friend, and this may be the only time I'm going to see you again.

What's going on?

Just wait right here, okay? Don't move.

I can't say it.

Bye!

[man 2] Step forward.

Something is wrong?

You speak English?

Yes. She is my sister.

Is something wrong?

I'm very sorry, but she may have lung disease.

No!

No, no, no, she is healthy.

- I am nurse. I know.

- She has to be examined further.

She could be contagious. Come on.

No. No, no, she is healthy.

Come with me.

No. Where are you taking her?

Come with me. She'll be held in our infirmary here

- for six months.

- No, no, no. No, no.

If she doesn't improve in that time, she has to be deported.

- No, no, no! No!

- Get back in line.

She doesn't go back.

We never go back.

[indistinct announcements]

[man] Welcome to the

United States of America. Next.

Your name, please.

Ewa Cybulska.

- Where are you from?

- Katowice. In Silesia.

- Poland?

- Yes.

Married or single?

- I'm not married.

- Uh-huh.

They took my sister.

I cannot bring...

We're not dealing with your sister right now, ma'am. Understood?

What was your occupation in Poland?

I was a nurse for an English diplomat.

Have you ever committed a crime of any kind?

- No.

- Mm-hmm.

Please, where is the infirmary?

Well, it says here on the manifest that you had a problem on the ship.

That you may be a woman of low morals.

Is that true?

No. That is not true.

- It's not true?

- No.

Do you have any money?

No, but my aunt and my uncle, they live here.

- Mm-hmm.

- And they're waiting for us.

Here at this address?

- Yes.

- Mm-hmm.

Well, apparently they didn't show, and this address doesn't exist.

It's not valid.

What... what is not valid?

It doesn't exist.

Now, we do not allow unescorted women into this country, especially if there's a question of low morals.

Due to your situation,

I'm going to have to designate you liable to become a public charge.

You'll be held for a hearing...

- [Ewa] No.

- ...and most likely deportation.

I'm sorry. Next.

Next. Next!

Name?

[indistinct conversation]

Good morning. I'm Bruno Weiss from the Travelers Aid Society.

Do you speak English?

No?

Good morning.

I speak English.

- You speak English?

- Yes.

- Do you speak it well?

- Oh, yes.

What's your name?

Ewa Cybulska.

A pleasure to meet you.

Bruno Weiss.

What about her?

Liable to become public charge.

She arrived with her sister who was quarantined for lung disease.

- Best of luck to you.

- Sir, sir.

Can you help me?

- Ma'am, you are in the exclusion line.

- Yes.

Did they explain to you what that meant?

Yes, yes. Please.

They're sending you back.

No, no, no. I... I can work.

You know this man.

You talk to them.

You have already been processed.

Their decision has been rendered.

There's very little I can do.

Please? Please?

Please?

- Please?

- One moment.

Please?

[indistinct whispering]

[sniffling]

[whispering continues]

[whispering] The last ferry to the city leaves in ten minutes.

This gentleman will escort you outside.

I cannot be seen leaving with you, but I will see you out there.

- Do you understand?

- Yes.

Yes.

Well, good luck to you.

Step this way, please, ma'am.

[crowd chattering]

[crewman] This is the last call for the ferry to New York.

[Bruno] Let's go, let's go.

You're a very lucky lady.

Good afternoon, Mr. Weiss.

You just made it.

Howard, thank you.

[crewman] All aboard!

Let's go! All aboard.

There's room in the front.

[crewman] Upon docking in Battery Park, if you have questions about further destinations, direct them to the barge office!

[ship's horn blows]

Right here.

- [crewman] Last call!

- What's the matter?

I leave my sister here.

Well, do not worry.

She's going to get the best medical care available.

Do you have a place to stay?

No.

Do... do you know somewhere?

Yeah, I know a place.

If you'd like, I can take you there.

- Yes?

- Yes.

[ship's horn blows]

Want me to take your satchel?

Here, come on.

- [gasps]

- Hey, watch out!

[horn honks]

[Bruno] I speak Yiddish.

People here don't mess with me.

Come on.

Right here.

You'll be comfortable.

Come on.

Hi, Mr. Bruno.

Hi, Sonja.

Where's your mother?

Right there. She's sleeping.

[whispering] Sonja, this is Ewa.

Ewa, Sonja.

Hi.

Well, it ain't the Ansonia, but it's comfortable.

There's a toilet in the middle of the hall with plumbing.

And you can sew right back here.

I don't know if you can sew, but it's a job.

I have some papers here for you.

[rustling]

Please, Miss, in order to receive aid,

I'll need you to fill out these forms.

Name, date of birth, country of origin, et cetera.

It's fairly self-explanatory.

If you need my help,

I'll just be in here.

Excuse me.

My little angel.

[Sonja] Hi.

[Bruno sighs]

Have you been practicing?

- [Sonja] Mm-hmm.

- That's good.

[whispered conversation]

[chuckles] That's perfect.

Do you need some help?

Maybe I come back tomorrow, for sewing.

I thought you said you had nowhere to stay.

Young lady, it's dangerous out there.

As long as you earn your keep, you're welcome to stay here.

Right there if you'd like.

I don't mean to be rude, but I have some business to take care of.

When your mother wakes up, will you tell her I'm at the theater?

- [Sonja] Yes.

- [Bruno] Thank you.

I'm sure you're very tired.

I can help you feel comfortable if you decide to stay.

Good night.

[door closes]

[Sonja] He likes you.

I can tell.

Is he your father?

No.

We live across the hall.

[metallic jingle]

[train whistle blowing in distance]

[gasps]

[sighs]

Morning.

You slept over 13 hours.

I received a telegram this morning.

It's about your sister.

- Can you read English?

- Yes.

Tuberculosis is a very bad disease.

Of course, you'll have to pay for her care somehow.

I can get her off the island, whether she's cured or not.

I know people.

It could be difficult and costly, but it can be done.

I gave them this address, of course.

So your sister will be able to send you letters.

You could use a wash.

There's a bathhouse across the street.

It's easy to find.

[clears throat]

[women talking indistinctly]

Come, come, doves!

Up, up, up!

Good morning, my Bruno.

[Bruno] Good morning.

It's raining today.

Let's hope it rains money.

- OK!

- Come on, let's go!

[woman] We have lots of money to make.

I'm sorry.

You're in a difficult situation.

I need to work.

Well, I can take you to my place of business.

It's a theater.

We could always use a seamstress down there.

But you need a bath.

Yes.

All right.

Belva!

Morning.

- What are you doing?

- What?

- Morning, Bruno.

- You got to hurry.

We got rehearsals at 11:00.

Let's move.

[Belva] I'm going!

[indistinct conversations]

[woman giggles]

It's from Bruno.

[Belva laughs]

[scoffs]

[chuckles]

Here. Oh.

Like this.

There.

Eat it all. [chuckles]

Thank you.

Get a little meat on your bones for the New York winter.

You come by yourself?

No. With my sister.

She's still on the island.

[Belva] You could get her off with money.

Bruno helped me get my brother out of there.

He can fly off the handle every now and then, but he's a real good employer.

[woman] Mmm.

But it take a lot of money to get them out of there.

Or a lot of fucking.

Of course, you could always wait for some white knight to come along.

Or you could steal. [chuckles]

Long as you don't mind getting beat to death when they catch you.

Maybe you work with us at Bandit's Roost.

Yes?

Is Bruno's place.

You want a bath?

Is warm.

OK. I help you.

She's looking for some employment.

Perhaps as a seamstress.

Hello.

Hi.

She's a real beauty.

She should be dancing, not sewing.

Excuse us a minute.

Yes. Thank you.

Rosie, please leave her to me.

I have a feeling about her.

She could be special.

[Rosie chuckles] OK.

I want to talk with you.

Times are changing. We got to compete with the moving pictures.

[Bruno groans]

[Rosie] If we want to keep serving the liquor, we got to clean up the girls.

They can't show so much.

[softly] OK.

We'll talk about this later.

I'll see you at dinner?

Yes, of course.

OK.

See you at the Ox Tail.

[softly] Bye.

[laughter, indistinct conversations]

[Belva] Hey, Bruno.

Say something.

- [laughter]

- [glass clinking]

[laughter continues]

Ladies...

...I know some of you have said hello, but I'd like to formally introduce and welcome our new friend, Ewa.

Escaped the Great War back in Europe.

You are a very brave girl.

And I am a very lucky man to be surrounded by my family.

My little doves.

Rosie, words do not suffice.

Again, such a beautiful spread.

Thank you.

[applause]

- Let's all enjoy.

- [man] Hear, hear.

Hello, Rosie.

- How's it all going?

- Hello.

Bruno, these two nice men, they are very good friend of police commissioner.

- Oh. How do you do? Bruno Weiss.

- [muttering]

Pleasure to meet you.

Hello, sir.

[Rosie] And I'm pretty sure they would like to see our pageant with the girls, yes?

[man] Pageant?

As long as it's decent.

You know, some places, they ain't decent.

Even though they may be serving, say, liquor, and with Prohibition, we can't have no problems.

We'll shut you down.

Yes.

We do it right.

Please, sit down.

And you know we have a lot of new shows for the New Year.

Um, a lot of singing and magic.

- Magic.

- Yeah.

Is that your department? Magic?

It can be.

- What?

- You're not thinking about bringing Orlando back, are you?

No. Uh, tomorrow, I go to New Jersey and choose a lot of acts.

Well, you know I have your best interest in mind.

[chuckling] Yes.

OK!

We got to have a prize for our pageant, yes?

[man] Sure.

[Rosie] Please put in the money.

[chuckles]

Our guest will choose who is the winner.

The best girl gets all the money.

- I don't have any.

- [Belva] Then you can't join.

Sorry. Those are the rules.

[Rosie] All right.

Belva, first.

[laughter]

- How could I forget?

- She's so good, and all in the right places.

- [applause, cheering]

- OK.

Uh, there is Ilda.

[cheering continues]

She put on a few pounds since last summer, but I believe everybody agree it's for the best.

OK.

- [applause]

- OK, Clara!

Beautiful Tessla.

[indistinct shouting]

[laughter]

Good night, my darlings.

Good night, Bruno.

- [ladies] Good night, Bruno!

- Thank you.

Good night.

[Bruno] ♪ I got a kick in the face

- [laughter]

- ♪ After my second birthday

♪ My hands were misplaced

[Ilda] Oh! Here we go.

[Bruno] ♪ And they continue to kick me, to call me... ♪

[Belva] Look at this.

Dollars!

- Geeps.

- You did very well, darling.

But I thought I did better!

[laughter]

Drinks.

- I want it, I want it.

- Oh, yes, drinks, drinks.

- We got to get the drinks!

- OK, OK.

- I want it, I want it, I want it.

- Drinks.

- Oh.

- What?

Oh, just having a drink.

Mm-hmm.

[distant laughter and chatter]

[knocking]

[Bruno] You don't care to join us?

No, thank you.

[scuffling]

[Bruno chuckles]

I used to dance on the streets as a kid for money.

We'd... fasten tin to our shoes.

The things you do to survive.

Who's that?

My sister, my mother and my father.

She's beautiful.

Her name is Magda.

Where are your parents now?

They are dead.

Do you mind my asking what happened?

They were killed by soldiers.

They cut their head off and they make us watch.

No, don't touch me.

Don't touch me.

Shame on you.

Shame!

I don't need to force myself on you!

You are a stranger to me, and you come into my home.

I feed you, I take care of you...

- [door slams]

- ...and you steal from us?!

You think I didn't see?

From the same people that tried to help you?

I should beat you to death.

You're not being smart.

You could work 50 years sewing and not make half of what you need.

Belva!

Belva, come in here.

[door opens]

Ewa has something she'd like to say to you and something she'd like to give to you.

[crying] I stole money from you.

Very good.

And what do you say?

- [sobs]

- [Bruno] Yes, thank you.

You see, we forgive each other.

It's all right.

We understand.

You're desperate.

We've all been desperate.

[sniffling]

But I can help you.

I want you at the theater tomorrow morning...

...to rehearse.

Do you understand?

The other ladies will show you how.

[sniffling] Yes.

You will see that my concern is for you.

[gong chimes]

[Bruno] Ladies and gentlemen,

I, Bruno Weiss, welcome you to Bandit's Roost.

Come, take a trip with me and my doves, as we take you round the globe, without leaving the comfort of your chair.

Behold, all the women of the world laid out before you for your viewing pleasure.

Each one a mistress of the art of love in her own domain.

- [applause]

- Straight from Ziegfeld's Theater...

...meet the lady of Spain!

Sample her spicy paella, señores!

Muy caliente.

[applause]

There is Little Egypt.

All the mysteries of the great pyramids will be revealed before your very eyes by this modern-day Cleopatra.

[whistling, cheering]

Or is it Miss Japan that catches your fancy?

This geisha girl has come from the Orient to tantalize the senses and soothe the white man's soul.

[piano playing exotic melody]

Oh...!

[audience whooping, whistling]

Find out how this Cossack of Love brought Napoleon to his knees and made the Kremlin quake with desire!

[whooping, whistling, cheering]

And there's Gypsy!

Oh, Gypsy, that turns boys into men and men back to boys.

Well, gentlemen, we have toured the world.

And now they're all yours, right back here in America.

Lady Liberty opens her arms to you and welcomes you to the bosom... of America!

[whooping, cheering, whistling]

[men singing patriotic melody]

[man in audience]

That's real beauty up there!

[men continue singing]

And now...

...and now...

[softly] Get her ready... and now...

[singing stops]

Thank you, thank you, thank you so...

And stay right there, gentlemen.

The big show is yet to come!

But first... please enjoy the dancing talents of Henry the Hoofer!

[piano playing jaunty melody]

Ewa, still got the big show coming.

- Drink this.

- No, no...

It is absinthe.

It makes it easier.

[Bruno] Back on in two minutes, ladies!

Just a little.

[men cheering, applauding, whooping in distance]

It look like she drink too much bar juice.

Well, she's a Dumb Dora, so what do you expect?

Of course she's gonna drink all the bar juice.

[Clara] I feel bad for her.

She doesn't know.

[Belva] Why do you feel bad?

Bruno can't take his eyes off her.

Next thing you know, he'll be treating her like a princess.

[Bruno] What a production.

Young lady, you were mesmerizing.

What?

Are you drunk?

Mr. Weiss?

Good evening.

My name is Oskar Straub.

Hello.

[gasps in recognition]

Mr. Straub, the garment maker from uptown.

How do you do?

I was very impressed with your show.

Thank you.

I'm just obliged for your high regard.

I have a problem.

Leo!

[Oskar] This is my son Leo.

[Bruno] Hello.

[Oskar] He needs care.

He's not, uh... manly.

I see.

We can definitely be of service.

Is there anything in particular you like?

[whispering] We could also provide your son

- with a male companion if he...

- No, no.

Uh-huh.

Sh-She's new.

She hasn't even shown herself.

I-I hate to disappoint you.

She's strictly a dancer.

Half now... half later?

Please... we must be discreet.

I'll speak to you in a moment, yes?

[Bruno] Why don't you go home now?

You don't have to do the second show.

Uh... hello?

[distant, echoing] Hello?

[Bruno's voice fades]

[door opens]

[footsteps approach slowly]

Hello, ma'am.

[Bruno] Ewa, this is Leo.

A nice young man.

Come...

...sit down...

...and you'll both get to know each other a little.

I'll just be outside.

I'm not...

My father... wants me to do this.

No... no...

No... no...

She doesn't want to do it.

Young man, she's pure.

You understand?

We'll be one moment.

[softly] I don't want you to do this, either.

But it's not my decision.

The truth is...

...we both know you are going to see this boy.

Because, for you, your sister's well-being is more important than your own.

I've learned that about you.

The boy is very gentle.

He doesn't know anything.

No one will ever know.

So, tell me now... if you do not wish to see this boy,

I'll send him away.

But tell me now.

[Bruno] I'll be just outside.

[door creaks shut]

[overlapping, indistinct conversations]

[waiter] Here you are, sir.

And by the way, we, uh, do have spirits available this evening.

- [Bruno] Good. I'll have a whiskey.

- [waiter] Yes, sir.

[Bruno] You need to eat.

You'll feel better.

Come on, Ewa, come on, eat something.

You don't want to try even a little bit?

Please, I don't want you to get sick.

How long I do this?

I don't know.

I don't know how much it's gonna cost to get her out.

But you helped your sister today.

Now, a client like Mr. Straub, he opens a lot of doors.

Now, we're not gonna give the cops their usual cut.

And that's a big, big risk for me.

'Cause I'm here to help you.

Not like your stupid uncle.

You know my uncle?

No, I don't know your uncle,

I know of your uncle.

When I got you off the island, when I paid to get you out...

McNally showed me the... the files.

I know about your uncle, your aunt.

They didn't do anything for you.

Here... here's your cut.

For your sister.

What, you don't like money?

You don't want it, I'll keep it.

- I like money.

- Good.

I don't like you.

I hate you.

And I hate myself.

[Bruno slurred, weakly]

I'm sorry, Ewa.

Don't hate me.

I want you.

Why do you say no to me?

I want you to love me.

[lock clicking]

[Bruno singing drunkenly]

I don't want to...

[sighs]

Ewa, Bruno loves you.

[Bruno gasping]

[rapid footsteps]

[people laughing, talking]

Excuse me, do you know this address?

Excuse me... sir... do you know this address?

Does it exist?

Green Park, Brooklyn.

- Over the bridge.

- Yes?

[man] Hello, chippie.

[man 2] Hey, chippie, come on back here!

[knocking on door]

[woman] Who is it?

[woman speaks Polish]

- [Ewa speaks Polish]

- [woman speaks Polish]

Ewa!

[laughing]

[in Polish]

[Ewa laughs gently]

[teakettle whistling]

Magda...

[chuckles]

[sniffles]

[clock ticking]

[Edyta humming]

[clock ticking]

[clock continues ticking, echoing]

[chuckles]

Magda.

[thunder rumbling]

[footsteps approaching]

[metallic jingling]

[in Polish]

[man] We're gonna have to ask you to come with us, please.

I don't understand.

You don't have proof of residence.

You're here illegally.

I'm sorry.

I'm gonna have to deport you.

[in Polish]

[officer] Let's go.

[in Polish]

Let's go. Jimmy!

[in Polish]

That's enough!

[in Polish]

Where you take her?

[in Polish]

[bell tolling]

[man] Your stay here in Ellis

Island will not be long.

Your deportation hearing is tomorrow.

They don't work on Sundays.

I see here you're from Poland.

You were already registered by Officer McNally.

We'll notify him.

Where is the hospital?

Uh, it's on the south side of the island. You can't see it from here.

My sister is there.

Can I see her?

There's no visitations.

I'm sorry.

[distant coughing]

But there's a show tonight for the detainees in the Registry Room, and... if she's well enough, you might see her there.

Oh, thank you.

Thank you very much.

[officer] Yeah, well, here's your bunk.

And listen, uh, if you look healthy for the board, it helps.

[softly] Yeah.

[door closes]

[in Polish]

[ship's horn blowing in distance]

[horn continues blowing in distance]

[horn fades]

[muffled singing in distance]

[water running]

[water stops running]

[in Polish]

[applause]

[emcee] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you!

Now, before you are entertained by the one and only Caruso, the world's finest tenor, we have one more of our local acts to thrill you.

Behold, a touch of magic from a prestidigitator who will amaze you with his gravity-defying derring-do, ladies and gentlemen, I give you

Orlando the Magician!

[applause]

Thank you.

Good evening. Good evening.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

The levitation.

Perhaps the most miraculous feat you'll ever witness.

Even the Great Houdini himself has never defied gravity in such a manner.

But tonight,

I will attempt to rise before your very eyes.

Now, there are those that query the possibility, but I understand that, you know.

- [crowd murmuring]

- I've heard it all before.

But I have to ask those people, how is it that you found yourself here at this very moment in America?

By boat, most likely, yes.

It would be a long swim.

But isn't it also because you believed it could happen?

Well, ladies and gentlemen,

I believe.

[crowd gasping]

[applause]

[applause continues]

Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Now, uh...

Excuse me, sir!

We're getting fresh now.

[emcee] Now, ladies and gentlemen, we ask you to be very quiet.

For the next trick, even the slightest break of concentration could prove to be fatal.

[Orlando] Now, I assure you this is an authentic straitjacket.

[officer] Yes.

[Orlando] Used on the criminally insane.

- Magda.

- My mother thinks I belong in it.

- Magda.

- I'm not sure how I feel about it.

- But I'm gonna step into this coffin.

- Magda.

[speaks native language]

[Orlando] I want you to secure it and lock it.

- Sorry.

- After I'm inside, of course.

And then I want you to shoot your weapon at me.

On my signal!

Ready!

Aim!

Fire!

- [gunshots]

- [crowd gasping]

[emcee] Oh, no!

Ladies and gentlemen,

Orlando the Magician has been shot dead!

This is tragic!

[lock clicking]

[crowd gasping]

Where, oh, where is Orlando?

[whistle blowing]

You missed.

[applause]

Happy New Year, sir.

Happy New Year.

Enjoy the show.

Enjoy the show.

Enjoy the show.

God, you're beautiful.

Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

Happy New Year.

Now, before I go, I just want to say, don't give up the faith.

Don't give up the hope.

The American Dream is waiting for you.

Now, without further ado,

I give you The Great Caruso!

[applause]

[singing in Italian]

[no audio]

[lock clicking]

[door creaks open]

[footsteps approaching]

[gasps]

[chuckles]

It's all right.

Have you eaten?

Did she get a meal?

Yeah. She didn't have much of an appetite, though.

I heard about what happened with your uncle.

And now they send you back home.

I don't know where is home.

What do you mean?

Here at least my sister is near.

You're so stubborn.

You are going to be deported.

Do you understand that?

I wish there was something more

I could do for you.

[gasps]

Listen to me.

Why don't we go, and tomorrow I will take you

- to get your...

- I want more money.

What?

I want more money.

I'm not opposed to that.

I will give you 50 cents of every dollar we make.

Half. Is that agreeable?

I don't trust you.

Ewa, come on.

I wouldn't come out here for anyone else but you.

No, I don't trust you.

And if you don't give me my money, then I-I will tell the police that you hid money from them.

- You're gonna tell the police?

- Yes.

- Yeah?

- Yes.

Uh, I'd rather you get the cut than the cops anyway.

All right.

So get your things.

Let's go.

Come on.

[♪ "Swanee River" plays on radio]

[man] You are so beautiful.

Thank you for this.

You should wear a lot of clothing.

February is cold winter.

If you catch a cold, I won't see you.

[chuckles] Yeah.

I will stay warm, I promise.

I gave the, uh... the-the money to Bruno.

This is just a little extra.

For your sister.

Thank you.

Hope she gets better soon.

Good-bye.

[door opens and closes]

[sighs]

[indistinct chatter]

[guitar playing]

[Orlando] One more time, one more time.

Ooh!

Think I've been drinking too much.

[laughter]

[footsteps approaching]

Good morning.

Good morning. Do you have my money from last night?

Well, some of the ladies and I are going up to Rhinebeck again this weekend.

I'd like it if you joined us this time.

[whispering] You might have fun.

Thank you for the money.

You think about it.

Bruno!

[sighs]

- I'm sorry. What?

- Rosie, what are you doing?

You bring Orlando back?

So what?

- You lied to me?

- He needs the work.

You remember what happened last time...

When he's on, he brings in the customers...

- Oh, bullshit.

- ...so good.

The girls bring in the customers.

I bring in the customers.

That's who makes the fucking money.

Shut your mouth down.

Listen to me.

You forget who is the boss here.

Yes, ma'am.

He stays.

Let's go.

Bruno!

Emil.

[chuckles]

Hey.

Well, well, well.

It's nice to see family.

- How are you?

- Doing all right.

[Orlando] Yeah. I guess you heard they took me back at Ellis Island, huh?

[Bruno] Congratulations.

[Orlando] They're doing really good over there, too.

And I can't tell you how excited I am to be working with you again tonight.

[sighs] It's gonna be just like old times.

Well, that's what I'm worried about.

No, no, no, no. I won't let you down.

[Bruno] Well, that means no more gambling

- and no more drinking.

- Absolutely.

I'm just blessed for this opportunity, and I just want to thank you.

All right.

Thank you, sir.

I sincerely hope so.

Yeah.

Hey. Hi.

This is my show.

So as long as you're... on time, uh, professional,

I don't foresee us having a problem.

Of course, of course.

I know... I know her.

That, uh... Hey, don't I know you from, uh...

- ...Ellis Island?

- Good luck tonight.

[applause]

Thank you, thank you.

And to the band, thank you.

My mini orchestra.

Now, in honor of my return to the Bandit's Roost,

I will perform my most famous mystification, which I have done for crown princes...

- [laughter]

- ...and heads of states all over the world.

This will be an act of mind reading.

I will know your dreams.

Look, we already sold all the liquor.

Yeah, I can tell from the crowd, but it doesn't mean they like him.

Before I get started,

I need to find a suitable subject from the audience.

[crowd groaning]

Who will it be?

Well, as much as I find all you men appealing,

I think I found a more suitable subject back here.

Please come up.

No, no, no.

- No, no. No!

- Come on.

Enjoy it.

[applause, cheering]

The Mind Reading.

So, what is your name, young lady?

- Ewa.

- [man] That's Lady Liberty!

She goes dog fashion for two dollars!

[cheering, laughter]

[man 2] You can sit on my torch,

Lady Liberty!

- [laughter]

- [Orlando] Ewa.

And where are you from, Ewa?

From Katowice.

Ah. So, what do you want here in America?

- I want to be happy.

- [Orlando] To be happy!

[man 3] I made you happy last night, you cheap whore!

[laughter]

[man 4] She's Bruno's best!

Don't listen to anything they're saying,

OK? They're just drunks.

[man 4] Hey, Bruno, I'll give you a dollar for the bitch.

[Ewa murmuring]

[man 5] Get down here and give a kiss to my cock, you whore!

[man 6] Better fuck me, or I'll cut your tits off!

Sir, you shut your mouth!

Or I'll punch another hole in your face!

[booing]

[glass shattering]

- I'll get you off, I'll get you off.

- [whispers] Ewa.

One second.

Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be right back for my greatest illusion,

"The Hindu Coffin," in a few moments.

But first, the sensual stylings of Bruno and his doves.

[booing continues]

[stomping and clapping rhythmically]

- Hurry up!

- Are you all right?

- Are you all right?

- Bruno?

- Why would you do that?

- I apologize. I'm sorry.

You embarrass her?

To get at me?

- What are you talking about?

- What am I talking about?

You know exactly what you did, you...

You stay away from my girls!

[Orlando] Hey, at least

I warmed them up for you.

[chuckles]

And that was Emil the Magician.

Forgive me, Orlando the Magician.

I didn't know he was supposed to make himself disappear.

Ewa.

[Bruno] And now the moment you've all been waiting for...

Hey, are you all right?

[Bruno] Behold, all the women of the world.

You disgrace me.

What's that?

You make fun of me.

No, no, I wasn't making fun of you.

It was...

It was just the act.

Miss Egypt.

All the mysteries of the great pyramids

- will be revealed...

- [man] Take it off!

...before your very eyes.

- All right, all right.

- Take it off!

This modern-day Cleopatra.

[Bruno muttering]

[cheering]

And...

Lady... Lady Liberty.

Lady Liberty!

Lady Liberty welcomes you with open arms.

And where the fuck is Lady Liberty?

...destroying her face again,

'cause that's always...

Don't touch her!

[Ewa screams]

What are you doing?

What is your problem?!

[cheering]

Bruno, what's wrong with you?

Why are you so angry?

Keep away from her!

[Rosie] Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!

- Fuck you!

- It's Bruno, he's gone mad!

- Stop it! Stop! Stop it! I told you!

- [glass shattering]

[man] Where do you think you're going, bitch?!

[screaming]

[grunting]

[shouting continues]

[glass shattering]

[Rosie] Walk! Walk!

[indistinct shouting]

Me? What are you talking about?

- It was all you!

- It was him!

You don't know what you're talk...!

- Fuck you, Rosie!

- Next time, I fire you!

You fire me? I quit!

- I quit!

- Go! Go! Go! Leave us!

You don't know what you're doing.

Yes, I do!

We don't need her!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I can't take it anymore!

He's crazy!

[Bruno] Yeah, well,

I'm sick of you, Rosie!

You lost us this place.

We'll find someplace else.

- This is how we make money.

- Yeah...

What are you guys doing?

Let's go! Move!

Where are we going?

It's winter.

I don't know!

We'll go uptown. Let's move.

I need that money.

- [girls shouting]

- You lose your temper.

You fight this man for what?

- You're so stupid!

- I'm stupid?!

You see what happened out there?

He insulted you!

I'm the one trying to protect you from him!

All right, enough.

Let's go.

How are we gonna fit this in the trunk?

Are you thinking?

I got to think of everything?

Listen up, listen up.

I come up with the routines.

I'm moving everything.

Let's go.

Out, out, out, out.

Before the cops come!

Where do we go?

Out!

[Bruno muttering]

[Bruno] After last night, even this should be more hospitable.

[Belva] Are you kidding?

What is this?

See through there?

It's the men's boarding houses.

There's nothing but men everywhere.

And I've got new material to match the costumes.

These men have nothing.

[Bruno muttering]

It's just temporary.

I'll find us a place.

Good morning, gentlemen.

[man whoops softly]

Sit here.

When I point to you, blankets off, get up and walk around.

You know what to do.

Understand?

Gentlemen, today's your lucky day.

May I direct your attention to the daughters of the finest families in New York society.

I give you the Astor family's wayward little girl.

Her father told her to go get a job.

Or will it be the child of Mr. Frick?

She was brought here directly by her chauffeur in the lap of luxury.

J.P. Morgan's prized... progeny.

She grew up with servants, but now she will serve you.

[crowd muttering]

Sir?

Walk around. Go up.

Show yourself.

Please speak directly to me.

Do not touch the ladies.

Ma'am, I'd, uh, like you to show me around the neighborhood, if you would.

You talk to him.

[indistinct chatter]

[Ewa] How old are you?

[boy] I'm 15.

You have no sickness?

No, ma'am.

Let me see.

- [chuckles]

- [person whistling outside]

What are you doing?

[door opens]

You don't bring...

You don't bring any friends.

[Orlando whispering]

Hey, she's here?

- Did you give him all the money?

- [boy] Yes, sir.

You sure? You didn't keep anything for yourself?

Nah, I paid him all the money.

OK, here, take this.

Get out of here.

[door closes]

Hello, ma'am.

Hello.

I hope you didn't mind that I came.

I mean, if you're worried, there's... there's a bunch of cops downstairs getting their shoes shined.

So if you like, you can scream.

They'll come right up, take me away.

What do you want from me?

[clears throat]

Well, I wanted to see you.

And I wanted to apologize for bringing you onstage last night.

Those guys, uh, were animals.

I know you judge me.

Judge you?

No.

I-I don't... judge anybody.

And believe me, I have my own problems a mile long.

So...

Well, I should be going.

You work at Ellis Island?

Uh, yeah, sometimes.

Are you important there?

Me? No.

Bruno, though, he-he's the one with the pull.

Oh.

He got me the job there a long time ago.

It's so strange.

It's a lot smaller than I remember.

This place.

You've been here before?

Uh, yeah.

He's my cousin, if you can believe it.

Our families came over here on a boat together.

We grew up here.

You know, Bruno and me used to be close, but then he changed.

[chuckles]

I'm curious.

How is it that you ended up working with him, anyway?

He brought me here.

They wanted to send me back, but he made it so I could stay.

My family here, they don't want me, so...

Wow. I'm sorry about your family.

Listen, I've seen a lot of girls in your situation, and let me tell you, it does not matter what you do.

My mother used to always tell me,

"God's eye is on every sparrow."

You got a right to be happy, Ewa.

At least that's what I think.

[Bruno muttering]

[Belva]

It's cold out here, Bruno.

I don't believe it.

That fucking kid skimmed me!

[echoing] Wait here!

[panting]

Eagerness to...

Oh, hey, Bruno.

Emil?

I'm glad you're here.

[panting]

Did you know about this?

No.

He-he paid the money.

I don't want his money.

Well, since when don't you want money, Bruno?

Ewa, will you please excuse us for a moment?

Close the door.

We're just gonna have a conversation between gentlemen.

[softly] Yes.

[Orlando] All right, let's talk then, like gentlemen.

[Bruno] Listen to me...

[conversation continues indistinctly]

And you do not take her... ever.

[chuckles] Oh, let me guess.

You're falling for her.

Well, first, selling her on the street is probably the wrong sentiment to send.

Bruno?

What... What are you doing?

- [muttering]

- Put that away.

- [grunting]

- [clattering]

Help! Help!

[grunting]

Stop!

[grunting]

[Ewa screaming in distance]

[panting]

Yeah?

- Oh.

- Drop it!

- Hey!

- Get the knife!

This man is in my home uninvited.

He attacked me!

- Take him in.

- Up against the wall!

- [speaks foreign language]

- Hey, shut your mouth!

You're lucky your kike teeth ain't all over the floor, huh?

- Yes, sir.

- Let's go. Out.

- You satisfied?!

- You, too. Come on.

- All right.

- [officer] See how you like it!

All right, I need my coat.

And my scarf.

[baby crying in distance]

- [Orlando] Here we go again, Bruno.

- [officer] Shut your mouth!

[up-tempo music plays on phonograph]

[knocking softly on door]

- Hello.

- Hello.

[clears throat]

[sighs]

They're gonna keep him till tomorrow.

But they let the pretty boy go because Bruno had the knife.

[sniffles]

[sighs]

Let's hope he don't get killed.

Bruno takes care of himself.

He will be well.

What if he's not?

I need him to take care of us.

[in Polish]

[sniffles] All I know is we never had no problems before.

And then you show up.

It was because of you they were fighting.

And now we lose a night of work, and, uh, we might have to take it out of your cut.

You don't take my money.

Ever.

You make your money the same way I make my money, and you're no better than me.

At least I don't kiss the feet of the man who makes me feel like a piece of trash.

What...

[piano music playing]

[Ewa] Hello.

[music stops]

[Orlando] Hi.

Is this yours?

Oh. Yeah.

I, uh...

...thought I left this behind.

It's, uh, sort of my good luck charm.

Sort of.

[man] Time to pack it up, Orlando.

Come on.

Isn't it, uh... getting late?

Should you be walking here alone?

It's not the first time.

So... you're leaving?

[sighs] Yes, I'm leaving.

I'm going on a tour across America.

Which is exciting.

Speaking of which, actually,

I want to show you something.

Come here.

Here it is.

This.

That's where I'm going.

That is California.

It's out west.

The sun is always shining there.

It is beautiful.

Yes, it is.

Hey... you should come with us.

If you want.

What do you think?

I mean, you could be my assistant.

We'll put you in a nice outfit.

And you can watch me make a fool of myself every night.

- [laughs]

- No.

No, I can't.

My sister is here on Ellis Island.

Your sister?

Yes. She's sick.

I send money for her care.

I see.

You want to see a picture of her?

Yeah, sure.

That's her.

I always keep her with me.

Yeah.

[chuckles softly]

She deserves to be happy.

- Yes, she does.

- Yes.

Well, you-you be careful.

- Yes.

- OK?

[Orlando] You know, I've known

Bruno my whole life.

I think... he may be in love with you.

- Hmm.

- Which, uh, is making him a little mad upstairs, if you know what I mean.

I don't think Bruno loves anyone.

But I need him.

He's the only one who can help me.

You know what?

I want you to have this.

It will bring you luck.

It looks good on you, too.

Thank you very much.

[softly] Yeah.

Good-bye.

[indistinct chatter nearby]

[train whistle blowing in distance]

[clinking]

[metallic creak]

Come back for more, huh?

Didn't the girls tell you to stay away from this place?

With all the cops around?

Come on.

It means a lot to me that you're here. Appreciate it.

- We need more firewood, Bruno.

- Huh?

[Ewa] We need wood for the stove. It's cold.

[Bruno chuckles] All right, well,

I won't let you get cold.

Come here.

After you.

Do me a favor. Would you grab a rag and oil in the corner?

[Bruno sighs]

Thank you.

Don't be frightened.

It's for our protection.

I'm tired of being kicked around.

I'm sick of it.

Family protects.

Emil comes around...

[mockingly] Orlando.

He's gone.

- He won't come back.

- [Bruno groans]

He always comes back.

I'm telling you, you got to stay away from him.

He's harmless.

Ewa, you don't know.

I had a girl once.

Clean, elegant.

I liked her.

I didn't want her to know what I did.

I didn't bring her around to the theater.

But he brought her down there,

'cause he knew.

And she broke it off with me, and she ran off with him.

My own cousin, and that's how he treats me.

[gun's cylinder closes]

All right.

Excuse me.

Go on.

Ewa?

Tomorrow's Sunday.

Maybe we can go to a matinee, just me and you.

Tomorrow I go to church.

What?

Tomorrow I go to church.

It's Candlemas.

That's fine.

Just stay away from Orlando.

[bell tolling]

[choir singing]

[priest in Latin] In nomine Patris,

et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

Amen.

[in Latin]

[in Polish]

[priest speaking Latin]

[priest continues speaking Latin]

[congregants] Amen.

[door thumps, echoes]

[speaking Polish]

[priest speaking Polish]

[priest] My child, in English, please.

I'm Polish only by descent.

[Ewa] Yes.

My last confession was a long time ago.

I have many, many sins.

[priest] Go on.

I lie.

I steal food.

I tried to steal money.

[priest] How did you come to this, child?

On the ship here, there is no food.

And no room.

It is very dirty.

And we are all together, like animals.

And these men, they forced themselves on me.

And for this, they say I am a woman of low morals.

[sighs]

My sister, she's sick, and this man comes and he promises to help me with my sister.

So...

...I use my body for money.

I...

I let him use me.

And...

And I stay with him.

And I'm ashamed.

[priest] God punishes you for your sins, my child.

[crying] I know. I know.

I know I...

I do not go to Heaven.

[priest] My child, does the shepherd not rejoice even more when the lost lamb returns to the fold?

All souls can be saved.

You must continue to have faith in your own salvation, but you must find a way to leave that man.

[crying]

So maybe I don't go to hell.

- [bells jingling]

- [laughter outside]

[knocking on window]

Hey.

Is Bruno here?

No.

- Hi.

- What are you doing here?

- I thought you had left.

- [grunting]

Well...

Well, I'm back.

[sighs]

- What happened?

- Good things.

So, I was on tour, and, uh, made it as far as New Jersey.

I got into a disagreement with the promoters and couldn't come to term...

I-I couldn't stop thinking about you.

I wanted to see you.

And I had to see you, to share the most magnificent news.

You should go.

Bruno is at his lawyer.

He will come back very soon.

Don't worry.

Don't worry about Bruno.

Yes, you should go.

He has a gun.

- A gun?

- Yes.

Ewa, we have to get rid of it.

He's not thinking straight.

Where is it?

Under the night table.

[sighs]

This... breeds nothing but sorrow.

All right, so listen.

I fell on some luck.

I won playing cards on the train and again last night.

So I have some money coming to me... a lot of it.

I'm gonna help you get your sister, and maybe we can all go out west.

Yes...

That's very kind.

You don't believe me.

It's...

We can talk tomorrow.

Where will you be?

I'll come find you.

OK.

I'll see you tomorrow.

- Yes.

- [chuckles]

[Bruno's voice outside]

Tell them to bring it up all the way next time to my place.

They're getting lazy.

[whispering] Go. Go.

- Hello.

- Hello.

I was thinking about you.

Ewa, I know I've given you every reason to distrust me.

And I have regrets.

But I'm gonna go tomorrow morning to Ellis Island and get you a visitor's pass to see your sister.

My contacts there tell me she's recovering quite well.

And maybe you can see her with greater frequency...

[door opens]

[Orlando] Bruno.

Oh, I'm sorry, Ewa. I...

I couldn't leave.

Not without teaching him a little lesson.

Ewa... you're with him?

He said he can help me with my sister.

He has money.

[Bruno] How could he possibly have that much money?

What are you thinking?

I-I'm the one with the connections.

Yeah? Well, things have changed, Bruno.

[Bruno] Ewa, you've known him for a few days.

Do you think he is going to help you?

He's going to give you money?

Ewa...

- Don't, please.

- Listen, no, it's OK.

- Don't do this.

- No, it's OK. It's OK.

- Put it down!

- He needs to hear this.

You don't have to. Please.

Bruno, I want you to tell Ewa that she's free to go now.

[Bruno sighs]

You've never been a prisoner.

You understand? Listen to me.

That's all you have to say to her.

- Come on.

- Put it down.

It's OK.

Come on, you can say it.

Come on. Tell her she's free to go.

Tell her she's free to...

[Bruno gasps]

That's all you have to say, and we'll both be gone.

I thought I was helping you.

Just say, "Ewa, you're free to go," and you'll never see my face again.

I'll vanish.

- One, two, three.

- I thought I was helping you.

- [gun clicks]

- [Bruno screams]

It's empty. [gasps]

[whimpering]

[groaning]

[whimpering]

[Orlando, labored breathing]

[Orlando groans]

[Ewa] What did you do?

Why?

What did you do?

He was gonna kill me.

I-I... Ewa, it's a trick.

It is a trick.

Do you understand?

- What did you do?

- Emil, get up!

[sobbing in Polish]

[Bruno] Emil?

Oh, God.

Fuck!

Stay back!

[Ewa] No, don't move him!

No! Emil!

- I'm sorry!

- [Bruno] Stay back!

- [Ewa] This is my fault.

- [Bruno] What?

[Ewa] This is my fault.

What?

I told him about the gun.

- I told him where it was.

- No, no, no.

- No, it was an accident.

- This is my fault.

Listen to me, it was an accident.

Listen, if you're mixed up in this, you'll never get out.

You'll never get free, you understand?

So, I take care of this.

You go in the back, you go in back, you hide.

You don't answer the door for anybody.

[thunder rumbling]

[thunder rumbling]

Ewa, what are you doing?

Go back. Go back inside.

Go back. [grunts]

[thunder rumbling]

[panting, grunting]

- [body thuds]

- Please, don't put him with the trash.

- No.

- Ewa, listen.

[panting] We got to act like nothing's wrong.

Like nothing happened.

OK?

All right?

[thunder rumbles]

[Bruno] Gentlemen.

These are the daughters of the most famous New York society.

I give you the Astor family's wayward little girl.

Her father told her to get a job.

Or will it be the daughter of Mr. Frick?

He told her, too, to get a job.

Now, may I please present heiress to Vanderbilt fortune.

Driven by her own chauffeur, she arrived in the lap of luxury.

What's the matter, honey?

You don't feel well?

- Ewa, can you stand up?

- No. No.

- All right, you, up, up, up, up.

- I'm not ready.

They're ready.

J.P. Morgan's prized progeny.

- What is it?

- I can't.

- [whistle blows]

- [girls gasping]

Freeze! Police!

[officer] Stop right there!

- [shouting]

- There she is!

- Let's go.

- Stop that fucking whore!

- Come on!

- [shouting]

Get that Polack bitch!

- [whistles blowing]

- [distant shouting]

Come on!

- Come on!

- [officers shouting]

- Come on!

- [Ewa cries out]

[whistle blowing in distance]

[clanging]

Open, you fucking thing!

Open!

In! In!

[panting] I'm too slow.

- Leave me behind!

- No!

[panting]

[officer] To the left!

Come on!

[officer] Split up!

Straight up ahead!

- [whistle blowing]

- There she is!

This way, boys!

- [panting]

- [officer] Police! Freeze!

Get in here!

I'll hide!

- I'll hide!

- No, keep running!

Keep running!

[officer] Stay on 'em, boys!

- [whistle blows]

- Run! Run! Run!

You! Halt!

- [whistle blowing]

- [officers shouting]

[officer] Whoa!

Hold on.

We ain't after you.

We're after her.

That crazy Polack bitch killed him, didn't she?

- [Bruno] What are you talking about?

- You know what we're talking about.

- Don't know what you're talking about.

- We have a witness.

- Witness?

- One of your own whores is talking, you dumb kike!

- Where is she, huh?

- [grunting]

[shouting]

- [thumping]

- [Bruno groaning]

[officer] Where is she?

You tell us where she is!

- Where is she?!

- [Bruno groaning]

[officer] You're not gonna talk, are you? You got any money?

Let's see what he's got on him.

His kind don't keep it in the bank, that's for sure.

Oh, that looks interesting.

Looks like a grand.

At least you made it worth our while, huh?

You bring her to us tomorrow on a silver platter, or it's your hide we're coming for.

Come on, let's get out of here.

He knows where to find us.

[Bruno panting]

[labored breathing]

[groans]

You have to leave.

They're looking for you.

[Ewa] Drink. It is opium.

It's for pain.

[grunts] Thank you.

You must leave.

I know.

Go.

I won't leave without my sister.

[winces]

Bruno, please.

If you have money...

I... I had the money for your sister.

But I didn't want you to leave me.

Now the cops took it.

They stole it from me.

So I can't help you.

And now I don't know what you can do.

Maybe I can get some.

But God will have to help me.

It's too much.

You... you can't.

I will get it.

Stop. Stop.

All right.

If you can, meet me in the Ox Tail in the back.

I'll wait for you.

Be careful.

[straining] Be careful.

[bell tolling]

You know, Bruno, I stuck my neck out very far for you here.

Did you a lot of favors.

So from now on, you know, you and me, we got to be strangers. I mean it.

I see you around town,

I'm walking the other way.

Let's go. Come on.

Before they see us.

Quickly.

[birds cawing]

[thunder rumbling]

[keys jingling]

You stay here.

Let me go sign your sister out.

It may take a couple minutes.

[door opens]

[door closes]

[wind howling]

I better keep drinking this opium.

[cork squeaks]

It feels like my jaw is broken.

It's not fitting straight.

They're tickets.

You can get on a boat and go across to Jersey.

Then get on a train.

It goes through Pittsburgh and goes to California.

You go out there and you'll start a new life.

You understand?

[shuffling]

[sighs]

You don't come?

No, I don't come.

If I go, they'll be looking for us the rest of our lives.

You and your sister never get settled.

You'll wind up dead or in jail.

But what do you do here?

They blame you.

They say you kill him by yourself.

Well, I did, didn't I?

Yes, I did.

And I will confess.

You got everything you need.

You go to the train and you get your sister back.

You did it. You saved her.

Yes.

I thank you.

Thank me?

For what?

I picked you.

I heard what happened to you on that boat, and I knew you were perfect for me.

[thunder rumbling]

When you first got here,

I told that guy to pull you out of the line.

I paid him.

I fixed it so your uncle left and you didn't have anybody.

And yeah,

I fell in love with you, Ewa, but it couldn't stop me from using you like I did all the others.

And you hate me.

I don't blame you for hating me.

Until now, I never killed nobody before, but it don't make a difference.

'Cause if you could lick my heart, you'd taste nothing but poison.

See, you think there's goodness in everybody, but there isn't.

So you go, and you forget about me, and you forget about this place!

And you forget about those things that I made you do!

Because I took everything from you, and I gave you nothing!

Nothing.

Because I'm nothing.

[panting]

[Ewa crying]

[crying continues]

[Bruno] Go.

# The Last Black Man in San Francisco

Jasmine?

Jasmine! We gonna be late. Come on.

Let's go.

Why do they have on these suits and we don't?

Something's going on right in our face.

Y'all so stuck in those iPhones,

J-Phone 12s or whatever.

Blow up in your hand.

You can't Google what's going on right now!

Are y'all paying attention?

Why do they have on these suits if we don't?

Why?

They here to clean this water?

When this water been dirtier than the devil's mouth for 50 years.

And now they want to clean it?

They got plans for us, man.

Looking like George Jetson rejects.

'Cause they weak!

Weak hearts! Weak lungs!

Can't even breathe up here without a mask.

But we was put through hell to be purified.

You know what I'm sayin', brothers and sisters?

Man, it's crazy what jail will do to a nigga.

They don't care about they water, man.

There's something going on.

We gonna get to the bottom of it.

And they lucky I'm a man of God right now!

You think he rehearses this every morning?

Or they would catch these hands.

Seems a bit more impromptu.

2019 out here!

We been yellin' about this water since before they were born.

Before they were born!

Where's this bus, man?

We're not gonna make it.

Y'all leave us the hell alone.

Unless y'all really here to help us.

We'll get there.

They got plans for us, man.

- We're not gonna make it, bro.

- Not for you and me.

So I urge you! Fight for your land!

Fight for your home!

- Fight for your...

- Let's skate.

This here?

This is the edge, bro!

The final frontier of Manifest Destiny.

Last edge of the city.

Man, two steps further, you'll be drinking that filthy saltwater.

But we built these ships, dredged these canals, in the San Francisco they never knew existed.

And now they come to build something new?

Whole blocks half in the past, half in the future.

But should you venture into their San Francisco, the one they pillaged for gold!

Remember your truth!

In the city of facades.

Take me with you! Hey! Hey!

Take me with you, man!

Come on, where are we going?

Where are we going?

Come on, I'm coming! I'm coming!

Look at them look at you.

Look down at you.

But we built them!

We are these homes!

Their eyes...

their pointed brims.

We move if they move.

Our sweat soaked in the wood.

Gilded in our image.

This is our home!

Our home!

Our home.

Thanks.

Are you sure they're gone?

Jim?

I mean, their car is gone.

Let's check the back, man.

Good morning. How are you?

Remember that time they were in the kitchen?

Jim!

Remember the kitchen?

Yeah, sure.

But, bruh.

Didn't I tell you these railings are periwinkle, not black.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah, I got it.

We gotta start coming more than every two weeks, bro.

This fuckin' garden's a nightmare.

- I'll bring my grandpa's tools next time.

- Please do.

Wallpaper's chipping.

These people are killing this house.

You're not goin' in, though, Jim.

I mean...

I mean... no.

They're definitely gone, though.

Better be quick this time. Hmm?

Yeah, I know.

Takes time.

Yeah, I know.

- I'll be at my spot.

- All right.

Quick.

Okay.

- Jesus, man!

- Honey.

Just get the heck out of here, man.

- What the fuck?

- He's not hurting anyone, Mar.

He's painting the house now?

- Well, yeah.

- Stop fixing my house!

I'm almost done. Just hold on.

Why don't you just paint the neighbors' houses?

- Theirs are worse than ours.

- Just hold on one second.

I mean, we appreciate it, in some way, but, yeah.

It's weird, man.

I'm almost done.

Look, we will call the cops, man.

And I mean it this time.

No, we're not gonna call the cops.

We're not calling the cops.

Just stop coming back.

I'm almost done. Hold on. Please, hold on.

Ugh! Just get off my fucking birdie bath.

Ugh! Get outta here, man.

- Those were $3.

- Fine.

I'll finish it next time. God!

Next time? Oh, just get...

Get the heck off my birdie bath!

Just water the plants in the back or I will.

Oh!

Bro!

You were supposed to be the lookout.

Mm-hmm.

You were the one that was so worried.

I got distracted.

Bro!

What if OG is right, though?

You really gotta stop eating the fish out there.

I think it's fine.

All fish has mercury.

I know, but I saw a seagull with a dick, bro.

Well, so I guess it's a male.

No, bro, like a human dick.

Oh, nasty-ass tumble-weave. Pussy.

- Wild, bro.

- Wassup, nigga?

Ain't tryin' do nothin'.

I ain't tryin' do that bullshit...

- Stop playin' before I slap your face.

- Man, shut your ass up, nigga.

I ain't finna chase you.

You play too much, bro.

You lucky I don't beat your ass out here, bro.

- Kofi! What's good, brother?

- What's up with y'all?

Hey, you know I seen Moms last night, right?

She was looking like she was missing a little bit on the top.

I mean, we shower in the same water, Jim.

So, niggas takin' showers together now?

Probably was.

That's fruity.

I was trying to tell him not to eat the fish because the water is toxic.

Well, duh. That's 'cause they built the atomic bomb right there, nigga.

I don't think that's true.

What'd he say?

- Damn.

- Breath stink. That's true.

Bro, them shoes ain't true.

I know your Jesus-lookin' ass ain't talkin', bro.

- Them things is phony.

- They're definitely phony.

- What about cuz, man?

- Oh, yeah, dude is a cat.

You see his hair, he might be a cheetah.

Can I help you?

I'd like to see the man in charge.

In here.

He's walking him into the Chief's office.

Oh, dear.

I want to report a murder.

Now, who's that?

Edgar O'Ryan.

Where was this murder committed?

- Edmund O'Brien.

- San Francisco.

- That's right.

- Oh. Oh, him, yeah, yeah.

Who was murdered?

I was.

What?

- How?

- Just watch it.

Hey, hand me my beer, Son.

- Yes, sir.

- Yeah.

Yeah, okay.

O'Brien is smoking a cigarette

- in his office.

- Okay, yeah.

- Secretary's perched.

- She pretty?

Mmm.

- Yeah?

- I'd say she is.

You dog.

Hey, Mont!

- Montgomery!

- Hmm?

How do I get their old croissant-throwing asses out of the house?

What if I peed on their table?

Like, what if I climbed up the birdie bath, broke in and just peed all over that stupid little yellow table?

Wouldn't that ruin the floors?

Yeah, I guess you got a point there.

Oh.

You think they'd let me live there as, like, a caretaker for the house?

No.

That's fucked up.

I mean, I take pretty good care of the house.

I think so at least.

Yeah, you do.

We like having you here, Jim.

I know, bro.

But... you know there's no place like home.

Yeah.

Good night, Dorothy.

Hmm. Yeah, man.

You're a nice man.

You're a nice woman.

But I don't know you.

Well, yeah.

You know me pretty well, actually.

But you aren't my husband.

You're a little too young for me.

I am young.

I'm always young.

You're a nice man.

Oh, thank you.

You're a nice woman.

You got me fucked up.

- We got you fucked up?

- We did!

That's all you gotta say?

What I'm supposed to do, take off?

I don't care about none of that shit.

I just ain't got nothin' else to say.

Man, I put that on a fact, that this nigga's a bitch, man.

Wassup, nigga?

'Sup, nigga?

How are you, nigga?

I hope she's not home.

That garden...

We have so much to do.

We have to rake it. We have to weed it.

- We have to...

- Jim.

Isn't that the car you used to live in?

Oh, God.

Jimmie!

What up, filth-smellin' motherfucker?

Do you need a ride?

Jimmie! What's happenin', baby?

Get your young, old-looking ass in the car.

Daddy face. Jimmie!

Oh, my God, where is this bus?

If you don't get your up the-father-from-

Good-Times shirt-wearing ass in this car...

You really gonna ride the bus with a shovel?

Get your farming ass in this car.

Jimmie the farmer with your bitch ass.

Come on. Laugh a little bit, Jimmie, shit.

Still the same.

Yep,

I like what you and your dad did with it.

So much you drove off with it?

No, I borrowed it.

I didn't just... Come on.

I drove off with it? I borrowed it. Shit.

Matter of fact,

I seen your dad the other day.

He was good and lonely.

By hisself.

Okay.

I told him,

"You need to get you a cat or a dog, or a woman or something, nigga, damn."

He's home alone.

Well, he ain't at home, but he's alone.

He's alone with no home.

Well, you live in a car by yourself.

Yeah, but I... But I'm not alone.

People like me.

I'm liked.

Lonely ass nigga.

When the last time you hung out with your daddy?

Couple weeks ago. I don't know.

Couple weeks ago?

The nigga needs you today.

Shit.

That's what...

That's what people have kids for, so they can have some companionship, somebody to hang out with.

That's why I ain't had no kids.

'Cause I don't wanna be bothered.

Your daddy don't want this fuckin' car, man.

- Hey.

- Hmm?

- Wasn't that the Savoy House?

- Oh, sure was.

It was 100 motherfuckers in there, rent-controlled.

They thought they owned that shit.

The landlord burned all of the people out of there.

'Cause, see, Jimmie, you never really own shit.

This car ain't mine.

But it never was yours.

You never own shit!

What the fuck?

Hey, what's goin' on, man?

No sé, bro.

Uh, sir?

What's-What's going on?

Oh, God.

She's moving.

Fighting like crazy with her sister.

When someone dies in the family, that's what white people do.

"This is for her, this is for him, this is mine."

Who's gonna have the house?

So they lost the house?

Who's gonna possess the house?

They're just fighting and fighting and fighting.

What's gonna happen to it now?

Why'd they have to move out

'cause her mom died?

I don't know.

They were... tasteless, but at least they didn't fuck it up.

Well, that will be 10 bucks, hun.

Since when?

Since that's the best deal you're gonna get on 60 Twix.

I didn't say 60 Twix, Auntie. I said 16.

How I'm gonna eat 60 Twix?

I don't know your life.

You act like you at Costco or something like that.

You ain't at Costco.

Hey, you can go to Costco if you need to.

- You Rosco.

- Go right now.

Sixteen. First time you had a check.

Jim. Jim.

Jim.

Jim?

So, gentlemen.

What can I do for you?

Yeah, we're curious about a house on Golden Gate near Fillmore.

- Mm-hmm.

- It's 959.

It's gray, it's got the gold trim.

- Uh, it's got...

- Yep, yep.

Yep, with the, um... the witch hat.

- Yeah, exactly.

- Yeah!

I know exactly what you're talking about.

- That place is very special.

- Hmm.

I used to drive past that house on my way to school every day.

- What school did you go to?

- I went to St. Ignatius.

You from here, too?

Yeah, third generation,

- I went to Reardon, actually.

- Really?

Yeah, we used to play y'all in football all the time.

- You used to kill us in football.

- Yeah, yeah.

I didn't wanna say that, but...

That's awesome, right on.

But, so, it's for sale?

I didn't hear about that.

Well, I'm not sure.

It seems like the owner and her sister are fighting over it.

But I guess her mom died.

Ah, man.

I don't know.

That sounds like an estate thing.

That's a sucky situation.

But, I mean...

With a house like that, they could be fighting over that for years.

While it just sits there.

It's a pity.

So it's really just... just empty?

It's fucked up, right?

So fucked up. Like, it bothers me.

There's all these people in the street, and these big old houses are just sitting there collecting dust.

But shit, what else can you say?

The fucking injustice of it.

Yeah.

Mont! We here, baby!

Spoiling all the fun, leveling most of this neighborhood in the name of Urban Renewal.

Sorry about your homes and your funky shops.

You can set up a shoeshine stand in front of the parking lot at Safeway.

But you distinguished truth-seekers want to know about the real hep cats who hung out here, in the "Harlem of the West," where a few of these homes did survive.

Like this beauty here, which was built clear back in the 1800s.

Before the black thing, this was all Japanese, till FDR's stormtroopers rounded them up into camps.

This house was built in the 1940s.

Say hi to our neighbor here, everybody.

Hi.

That would actually be about 100 years late for this style.

We can see from his gingerbread trim, this was built sometime in the 1850s.

Uh, 1946!

I'm gonna have to disagree with you there, dude man.

No architect in the 1940s was building in this style.

That's probably true, but this wasn't built by an architect.

My grandfather built this.

He came here in World War Il, he bought this lot, and he built this house.

The stairs. These windows.

The columns. The archways.

The witch hat.

The balustrades. The fish scales.

This balcony.

That wall to keep y'all the fuck out.

All of it.

By Jimmie Fails I, with his own two hands.

In 1946.

Wow.

That's pretty amazing.

Well... let's move on to our next stop.

The closet Patty Hearst willfully hid herself in before trotting on down...

What's good with that? What's going on?

Feel like the King of England.

King Jimmie. Wave.

Wave to the General.

- Hey, General.

- Yeah, but it's like a circle with your... with your elbow.

Yeah, and then cup the air.

That's "cup the air".

- Oh, yeah.

- Yeah, that's good.

It's a beautiful house, Jim.

More beautiful than I could have imagined.

Yeah.

It's not quite there yet.

I mean, they left Dickens.

Charles Dickens.

Philistines, bro.

Frost! Plath!

Hughes!

Jimmie! Langston Hughes! They left him!

Bro!

Philistines!

Mont.

Mont.

Wake up.

Got a plan.

It's crazy.

Last time I was here, these weeds was taller than me.

- She's expecting us?

- Yes, sir.

- Auntie!

- Jimmie!

Yes!

Oh! So good to see you!

- You look good!

- Thank you.

- Hey!

- This is Mont.

Nice to meet you. Oh.

Y'all not hot? Like, you want...

- It's hot as hell out here.

- Take your jacket off.

Ain't nobody gonna steal your jacket.

This is a nice neighborhood.

Man, he better not break my damn board.

Shut up. You should be thanking him.

He's the one that helped me pick out that board.

And besides... sometimes it's just nice to watch.

Mmm.

Ricky, do that trick you used to do, baby.

Nice, baby.

Y'all hella cute.

Aw, thank you.

So, how much of this stuff do you still have?

Really?

"How much of this stuff do you have?"

You just... No segue or nothin'?

You just came to see the stuff, huh?

Auntie, I got my first place.

Whoa.

Really?

- In the city?

- In the city.

Look at you!

Y'all must be doing pretty well to afford a spot there.

Yeah, we got lucky.

- Mm-hmm.

- It's super empty, though.

Your daddy didn't send you here, right?

- No.

- You sure?

I swear to God.

'Cause I hope he's done dragging you into his schemes.

Auntie, this is for us.

Okay.

Okay.

I'm proud of you, Jayboe.

- Really am.

- Thank you.

I miss that city.

Oh! Ooh!

You still look good, though, baby.

You still look good.

Mmm.

Oh, my goodness.

Mmm.

Damn, I knew you had some of it, but is this everything?

Everything your dad didn't smoke up.

Sorry. Came out a little harsh.

I'm fine.

You really got all of this.

Yep!

Got as much as I could.

Open that.

That's amazing.

Yeah, I knew that, out of everybody in this family, you would be the one to come looking for this stuff.

So...

I can...

Everything?

It's yours.

- Thank you.

- Hell, yeah.

Ricky, get the truck!

You guys good back there?

Bye. Thank you.

So, Ricky never lived in the house?

No, Wanda didn't meet him until after we lost it.

You gonna poop or not?

Hello.

- Hello, sir.

- Hey!

I'm Jimmie Fails.

We haven't had the chance to meet yet.

- Oh. Oh, yeah.

- Yeah.

Welcome to the neighborhood.

Yeah, oh, yes. Welcome.

Tim. Tim Ellory.

Sure, sure. Nice to meet you, man.

It's a fast-moving market.

I don't even remember a sign going up.

Oh, it didn't need to, but...

Look, Tim, I want you to know,

I'm gonna be the best damn neighbor you ever had.

Well... all right, Jimmie, thank you.

My pleasure.

Uh, well, you'll have to pardon me.

We've got lots to do, but...

- Of course, oh, yeah.

- Very nice to meet you, yeah.

What the fuck was that all about?

I wanna drink my coffee and scratch my ass while I read the paper.

You don't read the paper, Jimmie.

'Cause I never had a home to read it in.

Shit.

We could throw parties.

You could put on one of your plays.

We could yell.

- The neighbors, Jimmie.

- Oh, the neighbors?

- Hmm.

- I got neighbors now.

Hmm.

Come here, help me cut these out.

And make sure the color bleeds all the way through.

No white edges, all right?

Yes, sir. Same as always.

Yeah.

Same as always.

Hey, you remember that, uh, warehouse we squatted at?

After we lived in the El Dorado?

We lost that 'cause we didn't pay taxes, right?

Hell nah.

I paid our fair share of tax on that.

But who cares? Old drafty-ass roach nest.

Shit, it was that, or sleeping on the street with your little ass.

Well, I appreciate it, Dad.

Mm-hmm.

So, say I'm at a place now, and the owners left it.

I'm gonna pay taxes on it.

You put gas and electric in your name?

Right, I'm gonna do that next.

You know I know.

Okay, doin' it like your old man.

That's good.

And nobody's come to check on it?

Nope. It's empty.

Good. That buys you time.

And they been gone three years?

Nah, just recently.

Wait, what?

You were workin' on it while they were still in it?

Yeah.

Where is this house?

It's the house in Fillmore.

Wow.

Our old house.

What the fuck you mean, our old house?

Have you seen that house?

Well, yeah. I mean,

I be over there all the time.

Then you know that's not your old house and that's not your black-ass neighborhood.

Little disrespectful lyin' ass.

It's cool, right?

Yeah, man.

Did you see him today?

How'd it go?

He said this was a bad idea.

Thought you said he was an idiot.

Nah, he's just mad

'cause he lost the house.

But what if we shouldn't be here?

Who should be here more?

Hmm?

Some millionaire?

They'd want it 'cause it looks nice.

You're the reason it looks nice, Jim.

I don't know.

What the fuck?

I invited somebody.

What's good, nigga?

Glad you could make it.

What's goin' on?

Be back in a sec. Pardon me.

Y'all got an organ?

Columns and shit.

It's just y'all here?

Yeah.

It just makes noises.

Oh, okay.

It's nice to see you in that chair.

I didn't know you'd pick that one.

Thanks a lot, bro.

Kinda awkward, but this place is cool.

Yeah.

Jimmie's been doing a lot to fix it up.

How'd y'all get this?

It's Jimmie's.

His grandpa built it.

He was the first black man in San Francisco.

That's what they call him anyways.

Oh, shit.

- This that house?

- Hmm.

Hey, Jimmie used to talk about this spot all the time.

But you know how niggas be in the group home.

Overexaggerating and shit.

Trying to be all special.

You weren't lying about this one, though, huh, Jimmie?

You were in a group home?

Yeah.

For, like, a year.

Yep.

You guys wanna go for a schvitz?

A what?

Wait, your grandfather made this, too?

Nah. Nah, these white people did.

Uh-huh.

Well, how you know he was the first one, though?

This nigga be lyin'.

Bro, he came over here from New Orleans.

There was hella Japanese people, bro.

And then they got thrown into little war camps, and he wasn't tryin' to move into nobody else's shit.

So he built this, bro.

This is great.

You still skate, bro?

Nah.

No, I don't skate no more.

Oh, shit, I mean, you used to be hella raw.

Yeah.

Not no more.

Hey, you remember Gunna?

Remember when he got caught stealing from the candy lady?

Yeah, he's an ugly-ass crier.

Oh, man.

Hurt as fuck!

Hey, remember, uh, Miss Homer, the one that ran the group home?

- Oh, yeah!

- And she cut that nigga hair.

Had his line crooked hella much!

"Know damn well that white lady couldn't cut no hair!"

Had that nigga's shit lookin' like Lombard.

That nigga said Lomb...

Ah, man, you niggas gonna make me piss on myself.

Oh, shit, y'all got a bathroom up in here, man?

- In this big-ass house?

- It's down the hall.

It's the room with the little claw-foot tub.

All right.

This cool as shit, big-ass house.

Man...

I wish I had a grandpa like you.

Leave me some shit like this.

This shit's enjoyable.

Right on, bro.

I'm proud of you niggas. You too, Mont.

Crazy-ass.

Just living the life, man.

Y'all niggas really done made it, man.

Ah, shit, I'm gonna go use this bathroom real quick.

You a funny motherfucker, Jimmie.

"You a funny motherfucker, Jimmie."

You should, uh...

You should have your own room, bro.

That's okay, Jim.

Nah, seriously, man.

I been in your space forever.

This place is yours, too.

Any room?

How about this one?

Are you sure you want the dining room?

Yeah.

It's perfect.

Dream big, bro.

It's yours.

Um, yeah, we're gonna have to figure something out.

I don't have that much time.

It's a complicated situation.

No, the power's been on.

I just need the bill in my name.

Uh-huh.

Okay, great.

Well, when will I get the first invoice?

And you can't mail that any sooner?

All right, yeah.

He's talking about paying some bills.

'Cause I wouldn't say no if he offered to chip in a little more.

He already pays half, Grandpa.

Well, he's been here for a while, you know?

And he is not exactly family.

I think he knows that.

Let's hope so.

What's all this noise up in here?

I'm just packing some stuff.

It's for a project.

Since when?

I mean, we haven't even talked about the characters yet.

- You know how much I like that.

- Yeah, well, I'm still working on it.

Don't quite have a plot yet.

Well, we can brainstorm a little bit.

You know, that's where I think we the best at.

When we brainstorming.

I think I gotta brainstorm this one by myself right now.

But I'd love to talk about it soon.

You about ready, bro?

Mm-hmm.

Well, um... whatever it is, uh...

I'm proud of you.

- Wow, look at him.

- What type of shoes are those?

Yeah, you should start rocking like that, bra-bra.

What the fuck is up with your hat, Jimmie?

You look like a human cigarette.

I can't handle it.

Jimmie, is that a bowling ball?

It's the black Alice in Wonderland.

Hey, Monty, I heard you be whippin' out that little weenie on all the girls.

Bro, with that hair, you look like a Simpson.

Nigga, shut up, bro, your one-shirt-havin' ass.

Jimmie, you wear the same shirt every motherfuckin' day.

You look like a fiend, Jimmie. Come on!

Hey, just like your daddy!

I remember your crackhead-ass daddy.

And your dope-fiend-ass mom.

Family of fiends, dawg.

I done sold him a rock back in the day.

Hey, what you got up in there?

Some lace curtains for that whole beautifyin'-ass house that y'all been makin' up and shit?

Okay, Kofi! Okay, what else?

These niggas the other day, they pulled up the other day.

Niggas had all types of feminine shit goin' on in that house, bro.

Jimmie, what two men do that?

Just 'cause you in that big-ass house, you not better than us, Jimmie.

- Never.

- You're not better than us.

Hey, what is those, lace curtains you gonna beautify the house with?

Come on, man, soft-ass nigga.

I know who you is, Jimmie. Remember!

Hey, you know what y'all need to do?

Y'all need to disappear like a motherfuckin' magic trick, nigga!

Rabbit out the hat. Get the fuck out here.

Fuck outta here!

Jimmie! Jimmie! Go home!

You're really drawing them?

They just talk shit.

Well, you talked shit when I met you.

I did?

You did.

It's fine, though.

Why'd you hang out with me, then?

You care about things. I liked you.

You really don't give a fuck what anybody says?

I shouldn't get to appreciate them

'cause they're mean to me?

That's silly.

Oh.

What are you doing here?

What are you ever doing here?

Uh... didn't you move out, though?

Yeah.

They changed the fuckin' locks on me.

I'm sorry. That sucks.

What do you want, man?

How long you gonna be here?

I don't know yet. I'm just tryin' to... let go.

Okay, well...

I guess we'll just come back tomorrow, then.

Great.

That's nice.

Come on, Jim.

We'll go to my house.

In this crazy fuckin' city, you're still here.

Man, those damn kids dropping bubble gum all over the place.

It'll get all over your seat, man.

You know what I'm sayin'?

Think she'll stay there all night?

Watch, we'll come back and she'll be painting the windowsill.

Yes, baby. Yes, I will be there.

I know where those meetings are.

All right, you got it.

Wow, Mom.

Good to see you.

Um, yeah. Uh, I'm sorry.

Oh, no, we been back for three months now.

Uh, this is my friend, Mont.

Oh, hi. Excuse me, I'm Jimmie's mom.

Nice to meet you.

Pleasure to meet you.

You should stop by.

You know, come check it out.

Oh, that's nice. Yeah.

Okay. Well, I got your number.

Oh, I don't have a phone.

Well, I just have to come over there, then.

I'll be over there tomorrow.

Well, yeah, whenever.

Okay. Oh, my God. You taller than me now.

- Okay, bye, Son.

Yeah, bye. Uh...

Why? Why?

What happened?

Why?

What the fuck?

What happened?

- What the fuck happened?

- He got shot.

They shot him.

Who? Who shot him?

Who?

Bay niggas.

For what?

For what?

He was talking shit to the wrong niggas.

Tried to bluff some niggas out.

Tried to bluff them out?

Man, what's with all the questions, bro?

I just don't get it.

I just fuckin' seen y'all.

- And, nigga?

- And I don't fucking get it!

Man.

That's my fuckin' friend, too!

- All right, nigga.

All right.

Push up on this nigga, bro.

You finna let him say that?

That poor boy and his friends.

I'm sorry, Jimmie.

I hope I never made you feel like you weren't welcome here.

No, I... I never felt like that.

'Cause I don't care where you been.

You don't have to tell me.

It's just, you two... stick together.

You know, I was writing a play about him.

You don't have to stop now.

"You a funny motherfucker, Jimmie."

I know it sounds weird, but...

I kinda feel like that could've been me.

If not for the house.

Man, I wanna go home.

Filthy, fishy salt water.

Water been funkier than the devil's mouth for 50 years.

Now they wanna clean it up.

They've got plans for us.

We was made to be put through hell.

Purified. We was made to be put through hell.

Be purified.

Fuck!

Oh, God.

Fuck!

How did she toss all of our shit?

I don't think it was her.

Fuckin' traitor.

Okay.

Can you stay here and watch the shit?

Yeah, where you going?

- Where you going?

- I'll be back.

I'll be back.

Jimmie!

Sorry, uh, how can I help you today?

Uh...

- I want to buy a house.

- A house?

That's exciting.

Uh, are you working with an agent?

No. Do I need to?

No.

Not necessarily. Um... do you have a price range in mind?

I have a house in mind.

Oh.

Um... it's on the market, I assume?

How much are they asking?

At least four million.

Uh, and how much are you willing to put down?

How much is usual?

Well, typically, we'd be looking to secure at least 20%.

I wouldn't have that.

That's understandable.

It's going to be hard to land a place like that.

But suppose I ask instead, uh...

No, no, look.

I get it.

I'm young. Uh, I'm black.

I'm not rich.

I came here knowing all that.

But let's be real.

You also got a quota to meet.

- Now, I'm not calling you a predator.

- Sir.

But you're trying to make your money.

- So let me help you do that.

- Sir, that's not the way this works.

You can give me whatever deal you gotta give me. I don't care what it is.

'Cause unlike all the other people that default, this is the only house I'll ever want.

So I'll never miss a monthly bill, ever.

You can give me your highest interest rate.

You can give me your highest interest rate, okay?

- Fuck me.

- No, I completely...

You don't even have to feel bad.

You don't even have to feel bad.

Okay? I will pay back every single cent.

I'm sorry, sir.

I will pay back every single cent.

Okay, okay, you win!

Okay, yep, it's yours.

You charming bastard. Okay.

Talk to you soon. Bye-bye.

- How's it going, man?

- Fine, sir.

I noticed the house we discussed is now for sale.

There are some alarming elements in your literature

I thought you would like to know.

And certainly the Bureau of Real Estate would.

Uh-huh.

This claims the property has a view of the Golden Gate.

Which... I don't think is true.

Well, it isn't. It isn't true.

It also claims to have all the original fixtures, floors, and faucets.

Isn't true.

And are you planning on disclosing that there's no septic tank?

Which means, any day now, the garden could be flooded... with shit.

Where's this going, man?

Well... all this together seems like false advertisement.

Which is grounds for void of sale.

Potential revoke of license.

I thought it might've been you guys.

What's your deal, man?

Don't have a deal.

Hmm. Look... somebody on this floor would've gotten that house if it wasn't me.

At least I'm from here, right?

I put your stuff on the street as a favor.

- Okay.

- I could've had it trucked away, but I left it out for you.

Look, dick wad.

I'm not fucking around. I will report you.

For what? Listing a view of the bridge?

And fixtures?

Everybody does that.

I literally copy-pasted that shit.

Well, you're lying about the history of the house.

- I'm not lying about that.

- Yes, you are!

You say it was built 100 years earlier than it actually was.

Look, I'm not making this up.

Yes, you are!

James Fails built this house in 1946.

- James?

- Fails!

What are you talking about?

Look, man.

Deed of Trust, 1857.

Architect Gil-hoo-ley, some shit.

Your guy Fails lost it in the '90s.

See? Right there.

Look, man. If you need a week to find somewhere else, then take it.

But... don't go pulling some squatters rights shit on me, man.

I got your mail.

I know your name.

I don't want to call the cops.

I don't want to do that to you.

Where'd you go?

Doesn't matter, bro.

I got everything inside. Except the couch.

That shit almost fell on me.

Jim...

I spoke to the Realtor.

Yeah, fuck that guy.

He's gonna throw us out.

And eventually call the cops.

I don't know how much longer we can keep doing this.

I understand if you can't.

I do.

But I'm not leaving.

- Jim, he said your grand...

- Where am I gonna go?

My dad's in the SRO.

My aunt's out in bum fuck.

My mom...

Bro, I don't even know where my mom is.

I'm not leaving, bro.

I'm the last one left.

We have my house.

I can't go back there, bro.

Mont, this house...

This is what I do.

Hey, it's what we do, Mont.

This is our shit.

We can't give up now.

We gotta fight.

Right?

Yeah.

I'm with you, bro.

You always been with me.

Oh, shit, you're writing?

Yeah. Uh... I think I cracked a play.

I'd like to put it on next week, if that's all right.

Hell, yeah, get it, bro.

Mont?

Hella fuckin' early.

Here we go.

Why are you dressed like a white boy?

Oh.

It's for your little show, huh?

Man.

You mess up my daddy's chair, Montgomery?

Huh?

No. No, sir, we... we were just...

What you stuttering for?

You got stage fright already? Huh?

No.

I don't care about the chair, son.

But be easy with it.

Thank you.

Carry on.

Phew.

My daddy hated when I played that shit.

Yeah, come on in. Don't be shy.

His grandpa built it.

Not bad for a black man, huh?

Oh, no.

Very good. Very good.

So, this is gonna be interesting.

This is nice.

- Nice crowd, too.

- Yeah.

You make a lot of money on candy?

Sell candy?

- I used to, for years.

- Oh, yeah?

Most of these new white people moving in these black neighborhoods, they don't even know they standing in the kitchen where a dude got shot at.

Hmm.

I didn't know he was doing a play and shit.

He just invited us,

I don't know what weird shit they got goin' on, but it's pretty weird.

What I'm-a hit you for?

You my folks.

All right.

All right.

But I can't have soft niggas hanging around me.

Hit me.

Nah!

Nah! For what, nigga?

Hit me.

Man up, nigga. Man up!

No, bro! No! No, bro, no!

Oh, you soft.

You soft, nigga.

They gonna call you a bitch at your funeral.

I ain't no bitch!

I ain't no bitch! I'm a man!

Then hit me.

Hit me, bro. Hit me.

Hit me, nigga.

All right! All right!

Yeah! Here, nigga. I don't give a fuck.

Come see me, nigga.

Who out there hiding, hmm?

Man up! Man up, nigga!

- Man up!

- Hey!

No words. No words!

Please send e-hugs.

Make sure you like the post.

Ro-Ro-Ro-Rodney Tuck.

Mr. Tuck moved to Florida ten years ago!

Are these the people who knew Kofi?

Kofi had dimensions.

More than a... a post could reflect or a play could capture.

So I summon you.

Celebrate the life he lived.

Not through those who speak the loudest.

But through the memories he left us all.

Ma'am!

- Me?

- Hmm. How will you...

How will you remember Kofi?

Um...

Um... he, you know, he used to come and walk my niece home from school when she first moved up here.

He was a little gentleman, or whatnot, you know, sweet, um...

It's just sad.

Mmm.

- I coached Kofi in Pop Warner.

- Mm-hmm.

He stayed behind and helped me pack up every day.

Yeah.

And how about you, young man?

Shit, man.

I don't know.

Did I push him too hard?

Kofi was my nigga, man.

Did I push him too hard?

Bro.

Hmm. How about you?

Well... my last memory of Kofi was him talking shit to me.

He said some of the most fucked-up shit anybody's ever said to me.

But Kofi also got jumped for defending me against the older kids in the group home.

He didn't like to fight, but... he fought for me then.

People aren't one thing.

That.

All...

All of it.

What would have happened... if Kofi could've... showed himself?

All forms of himself.

The world... put him in a box!

And he never... pushed beyond it.

Let us.

Let us break the boxes!

Let us give each other the courage to-to see!

Beyond the stories we are born into!

Let us all really look at Jimmie Fails IV.

Self-taught historian.

Carpenter.

Gentle, loving man.

A true survivor. Jimmie!

How many places have you lived?

And if they kicked you out tomorrow, you would still be all those things!

You exist beyond the... these walls.

You extend beyond your... your forefathers!

You're not this house!

Jimmie, you are not these... these walls!

You're not these floors, you're not this ceiling!

- It's time you know!

- Bro, what are you doing?

- What are you doing?

- It is time!

- It is time you know!

- I don't need to know.

I don't need to know.

Let's stop. Let's stop.

- Jimmie, you don't need...

- Enough, stop!

- Please, stop. Mont!

- Jimmie!

- Your grandpa didn't build this house!

- Enough!

He didn't build it, Jimmie!

Yes, he did.

He built this house!

He didn't. I saw it, man. I saw the deed.

I saw it.

I don't know what the hell that thing was.

Then he shoots a left. Psh!

Ha!

Man, let 'em leave.

They don't deserve to be in here anyway.

Neither do we.

You gonna really let some old-ass nigga tell you what's true?

Come on, Jayboe.

Get your spine up, Son.

- Have some pride, man.

- I've been doin'.

But you say it.

Say what?

The truth.

What?

That grandpa didn't build this house.

Man, get outta here with that bullshit.

Come on, Jayboe.

Just say it.

Can't tell you shit.

I'm outta here, man.

You sit in that bullshit if you want.

Jayboe.

I been telling people he built it for so long.

Almost forgot it wasn't true.

This was ours.

And then it wasn't.

So you just tell yourself what you need to make you feel like it still is.

Shit.

I did it, too.

It makes you feel... special.

But you got a chance to get out from underneath all of that now.

I don't want to.

I just want it.

Is that what you really want?

To spend the rest of your life working for this?

Fighting for this?

I believe that you could make this place yours.

I really do.

But if you leave... it's not your loss.

It's San Francisco's.

Fuck San Francisco.

- This city blows.

- Big time.

I mean, whatever.

I'm not above living in a former crack house, you know?

But I came here for Janis and the Airplane, not to work at a fucking start-up.

Dude, I've been saying for months, let's just move to East LA.

This city's dead.

Yeah.

Seriously, fuck this city.

Excuse me?

You don't get to hate San Francisco.

I'm sorry, what?

Yeah, dude, I mean, sorry, but I'll hate what I want.

Do you love it?

It's... I mean, yeah, I'm here.

But do I have to love it?

You don't get to hate it unless you love it.

Classic Muni shit.

Who call the money man?

Come on now, hurry up.

Pay attention!

Alexander the Great was a black man.

They don't teach you that in the devil school system.

I can't take another day of this bullshit.

Oh, Jim.

I'm sorry I did that.

It was a stupid play.

Nah.

I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth.

I just wanted it to be true.

It felt so good, you know?

It's okay.

Hey, Jimmie. Are you hungry?

Fucking starving.

He's giving up.

I can't take no more.

- He's breaking down.

- Oh, wow.

He's really tearing this apartment apart.

This looks exciting, though, you know?

- Yeah. Yeah, it is.

- Yeah? Oh, yeah?

- Oh! I got it now.

- Oh!

He seems like he's horny or something.

He's banging on the door again.

# Worst Person in the World

THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD

A FILM IN 12 CHAPTERS,

A PROLOGUE AND AN EPILOGUE.

You've been through the epidermis, derma and muscles.

PROLOGUE

Julie disappointed herself.

This used to be so easy.

She was still among the top students,

but there were too many interruptions,

updates, feeds, unsolvable global problems.

She sensed

a gnawing unease she had tried to suppress by cramming,

by drowning it in digital interference.

This was wrong. This wasn't her.

She '0' chosen medicine because it was so hard to gain admission.

Where her excellent grades actually meant something.

But then she had a revelation.

Her passion had always been the soul.

The mind, not the body.

Surgery is like, so concrete.

It's almost like being a carpenter.

But now...

My passion has always been what goes on inside, thoughts and feelings...

It was like a window had opened.

...not anatomy.

If psychology will make you happy, then do it.

I think you're really brave.

I can't take it anymore. I don't want to.

She left him.

Though he was devastated,

he had to respect the way she took control of her life.

She observed her fellow students,

Norway's future spiritual advisers.

Mostly girls with borderline eating disorders.

Say you're at a party.

She still felt trapped in the role of a model student.

All this cramming.

When was life supposed to start?

What's your name?

-Julie.

-Julie. The person's name is Julie.

Let's say Julie and I meet at a party, and we feel a mutual attraction.

Hypothetically.

Actually, she was a visual person.

Now I know.

I want to be a photographer.

A photographer? I see.

Julie spent her student loan on cameras and lenses.

As long as you're serious about it.

No safety net. No holding back.

-Need help?

-She took a temp job in a bookstore.

Started on a photography course.

She made new friends.

It felt like coming home.

Suddenly Oslo was a different city.

New places. New faces.

-Hi. Aksel.

-Right...

You're the comic book artist?

She'd heard he was the creator of Bobcat.

SORRY, I'M A WILD ANIMAL...

-Have you read it?

-Yeah.

So?

She pretended she'd read it.

She only remembered one strip she'd found vaguely sexist.

I know what you mean.

Nothing's ever good enough.

The only thing worse than all the idiots is yourself.

But...

If we go on, I'll fall in love with you.

Then it'll be too late.

Maybe we should agree to... stop seeing each other.

The problem is our age difference.

I'm just afraid we'll fall into in a vicious circle.

You're much younger than I am.

You'll start to question who you are.

I'm past 40. I've entered a new phase.

Whereas you still need time to find yourself.

You don't need me waiting.

You need to be completely free.

I'm just afraid we'll hurt each other.

Later she said that was the precise moment

she fell in love with him.

Shall I put your bag in the bedroom?

Yes, please.

I have two copies of a book!

-Huh?

-Yeah.

I'll throw one away.

Can I have two shelves?

How many closets do you need?

How many can I have?

No, that's not how it works.

This is antique glass. All wavy and stuff.

No, don't do that. Not like that.

No! Lift this catch here.

I'm terrified it'll break.

I gaze out this window.

-No way!

-I'm not kidding!

Hey, that's how relationships work.

She's a bit frosty towards me. That's new.

Yeah? Why do you think that is?

It's embarrassing to say.

We've been single together.

Lived that life.

Then suddenly I move in with you.

-And you're happy?

-Yeah.

No, no, no!

-Did you date this guy?

-Yeah, just a fling.

- Okay

- Stop!

-You're so predictable!

-Let's just fuck.

Hello!

CHAPTER 1

THE OTHERS

-Happy to see you!

-Me, too.

-Doing good?

-Yeah.

Hi, Martin. Welcome.

Thanks for coming.

Dad designed it.

We should renovate, but we don't want to change anything.

It's beautiful.

Yeah, but there's stuff like that. Damp.

We get this room because we're childless.

Dibs on the top bunk.

I always feel that Tone doesn't like me.

She's just shy.

That's what you say about boring people.

-It's my turn now.

-Okay.

-Thank you.

- Vin?

- Vin de blanc.

-Thanks.

Do you have any friends with kids yet?

No. Only one.

I guess this feels unfamiliar.

-They're very sweet.

-Thanks.

So what are you doing now, Julie?

Aksel says you've started writing?

Well, I wouldn't exactly call it writing.

Being modest?

-No.

-Seems so.

Is there something you'd like to do, as a career?

Questions, questions, Karianne.

That question was vulgar when we were students.

-Lucky you!

-Yeah, we were.

True, we had a lot of freedom.

Being young today is different.

The pressure is heart-breaking.

There's no time to think.

Always something on the screen.

Take William.

If we don't set limits, he spends his life on screens.

Nice try.

Okay.

No, it's not your turn.

It's Martin's turn.

Julie's still the closest.

Bedtime.

-She's exhausted.

-No!

No!

'Yes!

“No!

I don't want to go to bed!

I don't want to!

Eva, don't make another scene. Come here!

No! I don't want to!

Let go!

-You silly girl!

-I don't want to!

-But I want you to!

-I don't want to!

-Kids can be intense.

-Well, it's okay.

-Fun with kids.

-Yeah.

-Can't we just enjoy it?

-Please. No fights.

There are kids here, and it's chaos.

Just try.

Try playing with them or something, okay?

Please. Spare me the kid talk.

Sorry, but I wasn't the one who started.

You're with someone who's younger than you. There's a gap.

You're almost 30.

Not a bad age to have kids.

I'm 44. I want to get on in life.

With you.

It has nothing to do with my friends.

You seem to be waiting for something.

I don't know what.

-Hello?

-Jeez.

I didn't want to get into this.

Really not.

Everything's on your terms.

You have time off, so we're on holiday.

-You agreed.

-After you publish, you get bored.

And start talking about kids.

The others here have kids, so it's an issue.

-Not true.

-It is true.

And then you get a new idea at some point, and disappear into your drawing board.

What are you saying?

Don't start. It's not cool.

Shut up. Please.

Of course I'd be there if we had kids.

You know that. You know I want children.

Sure, and I'll also want kids at some point.

But I don't know.

I have no maternal instinct, right?

No, you'd make a great mom.

I'm sure of it.

I want to have children too.

At some point.

So what are we waiting for?

What has to happen first?

I don't know what exactly.

I just want to do more first.

Okay, like what?

-What's the obstacle?

-I don't know! Why do you ask?

Your concept is flawed.

Most people have kids without sorting out their life first.

-They figure it out.

-Flawed?

That's how most people do it.

But I don't want everything to happen on your terms, based on what you want.

Fine, I got it. But what do you want?

Oh, please! We have to stop.

I need sleep to put up with those people.

I know a guy who has a theory about that.

He says we have a limited number of sperm.

Say three trillion in your lifetime.

Jerk off too much and you run out.

Could be true.

Easy now, Portnoy.

How fascinating.

Personally, I feel like

I know everything about male problems.

Erectile dysfunction, morning wood, infatuation with young women...

-Premature ejaculation.

-Nice work, Aksel.

It's in all the books and movies.

Where's the menstrual period?

Female orgasm and desire? Where?

Good question. Tell us. In juicy detail.

No, the point is it shouldn't be taboo.

If men had periods, that's all we'd hear about.

Can you womansplain it a bit better?

What do you mean?

Like mansplaining, but womansplaining.

-What?

-Mansplaining is...

When a 45-year-old man explains how things really are to a younger woman.

-Nice demonstration!

-My pleasure.

-Ding! Great!

-Whiskey, anyone?

How's the senior citizen club doing?

Come on.

Look who's here!

Are you okay?

Not really.

Show me.

No!

Let me see...

We'll laugh about it later.

It's just a scratch.

Karianne's such a drama queen.

It's my fault.

Not at all, Julie.

It is. I always overdo it.

I know being here isn't easy for you.

I'm not into this whole

"happy family" thing either.

I'm glad it turned into a party tonight.

I hope you had fun!

What the hell's wrong with you?

What's wrong with having a little fun?

I didn't have any fun!

Sorry that happened.

You don't care!

Shut up! Just shut up!

You don't give a shit about me!

Shall we make a baby?

Fuck you.

-Hi.

-Good morning.

There's coffee. And cups.

CHAPTER 2

CHEATING

Sorry, I forgot. What's your line of work?

I work in a bookstore.

Which one?

Norli, by the university.

Could you excuse me for a moment?

Could you sign it?

Sure, I'll just finish this.

Any new Bobcat in the pipeline?

I've moved on.

Do you work full-time there, or are you just temping on weekends?

-Sorry.

-Bye.

Hey, I think I'll head home.

Okay.

-You good?

-Yeah.

-Sure?

-Yeah, I'm fine.

-I can stay if you like.

-It's okay.

-But I have to stay a bit longer.

-Of course.

Okay. See you at home.

Hi. Can I have a smoke?

Of course.

I had my second child ten years later.

Now we're supposed to introduce solids at 4 months.

What made the pediatricians change their minds?

-Do you cuddle your kids?

-Sure, a lot.

They'll be drug addicts.

They'll be addicts because I cuddle them?

Yeah, according to new research.

New research says you shouldn't cuddle your kids?

I realize it must be counter intuitive for a mother.

But motherhood upsets your limbic system.

So my kids are going to be drug addicts?

That's ridiculous. Do you have children?

No, but I'm a doctor.

I have a medical perspective.

Babies express themselves by crying.

It's normal for a mother or a father to comfort them.

Hi.

Not asking me the usual questions?

-Which ones?

-Who I am, what I do.

Who are you? What do you do?

I hate those questions.

They're especially bad when you're a doctor.

Are you a doctor?

No, you are.

Which questions should I ask?

Ask me who I know here.

-Who do you know here?

-Nobody.

I crashed the party.

You just waltzed in?

Okay.

-Nothing's gonna happen.

-Of course not.

I'm with someone I love.

Me too.

And I can't stand cheating.

I've been there. Never again.

-Right, cheating is...

-No good.

But where do you draw the line?

-You can feel it.

-If I do this...

-Is that cheating?

-No.

What about this?

-No, that's permissible.

-Is it?

And hurting someone who's not your partner?

-You hurt your partner?

-Is that cheating?

Did that hurt?

Did it?

-Feelgood?

-Yeah, it did.

Okay.

-Let me smell your sweat.

-No.

Yes.

-Seriously?

-Yes, that's allowed.

-It stinks!

-Yes.

The kind of smell you never forget.

My turn to smell you.

No, please. I regret it now.

Let me smell.

I think you smell nice.

I don't know if... this is permissible.

-Go ahead.

-Okay.

You start, then I'll go next.

I actually think sex is best when the dick isn't too hard.

Because“.

İn a way, then I'm the one who makes it hard, you know?

My secret will be dumb now.

I guess I misunderstood.

I was going to say

I like the Bar code Project.

It looks pretty from the bridge when I go to work.

I expose my darkest secrets, and you...

You said "secrets", not "darkest".

So why is that a secret?

Because everyone thinks it's ugly.

Sorry, we're...

-Can I whisper it?

-Okay.

What?

Sorry, I seem to be sitting on everything.

My bad.

There's nothing sexual about that.

Not at all.

Although you do like soft dicks.

Okay. Your turn.

-I can't pee.

-Just relax.

I'm going this way.

Okay.

What's your name?

Julie.

-I'm Eivind. Eivind...

-Don't say it.

-Why not?

-I'LL find you on Facebook, and...

Good thinking.

- Okay.

- Okay.

-Bye.

-Bye.

-We didn't cheat.

-No.

-Not at all.

-No.

-Bye.

-Bye.

CHAPTER 3

ORAL SEX IN THE AGE OF 



#ME TOO

Aksel?

Aksel, I need to tell you something.

Aksel?

A friend told me she had sex with a man

who pumped his dick into her mouth while he held her head.

She was confused because she enjoyed it.

It really turned her on.

Can you be a feminist and still enjoy being mouth-fucked ?

"Most women I know are ambivalent about performing oral sex.

They must act as if they like the pathetic expectation

that it'll turn them on.

I like it flaccid.

So I create the stiffness instead of having it thrust upon me."

This is good.

-Yeah?

-It's over the top.

I don't agree with everything, but it's very well written.

Original. Very good.

What will you do with it?

I don't know.

You really think it's good?

Yeah. Absolutely.

You sure?

-Yeah, I'm not lying.

-No?

-Are you sure?

-Don't you dare doubt it.

It's pretty cerebral.

But it turns me on, too.

-Right?

-Kinda.

Is that why you wrote it?

Intellectual Viagra?

-Yeah.

-It works.

Her piece "Oral Sex in the Age of 



#Me Too"

was published on jubel.no.

It was widely shared and set off a lively Facebook debate.

With the strong painkillers I'm on,

I can't drive.

CHAPTER 4

OUR OWN FAMILY

I hoped I could come, but...

I can't spend an hour on a bus with this back.

Don't worry about it.

Could you come to Hanefoss next weekend?

So we can celebrate together.

Nathalie says happy birthday, too.

Say hello from me.

How nice to see you.

- It's been too long.

- Way too long.

Anyway, have a nice birthday.

Thanks. Okay.

I'm too skinny?

-You work too much.

-True.

We'll talk later.

Happy birthday!

Why do I always have to go see him?

He's not coming?

Well, he's got a backache.

There's always something wrong with him.

Hello!

So, he's not coming.

That's not nice.

He wanted to, but has a backache.

Does he realize how it makes you feel?

-He's —

-It's a backache, Mom.

Sorry. Please help yourself.

Thank you. It looks delicious.

I hope you like it.

Hurray and happy birthday today

It's time to celebrate you

At 30, Julie's mom, Eva, had been divorced for two years.

A single mom and accountant in a publishing house.

Let us dance, hop, jump and turn

Wishing you the very happiest returns

For now it's time for celebration

Congratulations!

Thanks.

-Have you read Julie's article?

-Of course.

-And?

-It's great. Have you read it, Mom?

No.

Julie's article. It's excellent.

At 30, Julie's grandmother had three children.

She played Rebecca West in Rosmersholm at the National Theater.

At 30, Julie's great-grandmother, Astrid, was a widow, alone with four children.

Julie's great-great-grandmother had seven children.

Two died of tuberculosis.

Julie's great-great-great-grandmother,

Herta, was a merchant's wife

with six children in a loveless marriage.

Julie's great-great-great-great- grandmother never turned 30.

The life expectancy for women at the time was 35 years.

I don't want to bother you with it, but...

It's getting harder and harder to pee.

I was scared it was prostate cancer, but it wasn't.

-Well, that's good.

-Yeah.

Still...

I go to the toilet all the time.

And there's leakage.

Thanks for the cool jacket. Good timing.

I want to get into hiking.

Sorry we're late.

You didn't make them coffee?

It's okay.

I'll fix something.

-How'd it go?

-Great.

-How many saves?

-Lots.

Good job.

Happy belated birthday.

30 is pretty major.

Too bad we missed it.

The tournament lasted all day.

So we couldn't come.

No problem. That's okay.

She's the goalkeeper.

You should see her play.

No. She doesn't have to.

She's awesome.

I'll let you know next time.

Yeah, please do.

Cool.

Did you get the article I sent you?

Yeah, I was about to ask you.

I couldn't get the link to work.

My PC acts up.

Know anything about computers?

I can take a look.

But can't she just resend the e-mail?

Wasn't there a...

-Did she send it in an e-mail?

-An attachment to an e-mail.

No, I pressed the button on the mouse.

Then I put the arrow on the square.

Tried twice, then it vanished.

It could have been my fault.

Maybe I sent the wrong version.

We'll fix it.

You have to read that article.

It's really good.

Very...

Very well written, and...

Clever girl.

When are you coming to see us, Per Harald?

We'd love it.

Come see where your daughter lives.

Sure, of course.

But it's hard to park in Central Oslo.

They've got that... resident... resident parking there.

Yeah.

It's made it much easier to find a space.

You just have to pay.

And move the car every half hour?

Is that the reason you don't come to see us?

Because it's hard to drive in town?

That's not it.

Then what is it?

Well, you know...

With my painkillers,

I'm not allowed to drive.

There's that, too.

The good thing is, he's open about it.

His pains.

His prostate.

You have to make your own family.

CHAPTER 5

BAD TIMING

-Excuse me?

-Hi.

Do you have Green Yoga'?

Let me check.

Which book again?

Green Yoga. Published last year.

No, I'll have to order it.

It's not in stock.

How long will it take?

Two weeks.

Okay. No thanks.

-They don't have it either.

-Okay.

We can try at Ark.

Thank you.

I told her I forgot my sunglasses.

I just had to say that I know what we said.

But I think about you a lot.

And...

I don't want to bug you if you're happy.

Are you?

-I don't know what to say.

-Say nothing.

I'd like to see you again. Just to talk.

I mean, I'm not going to...

But I'd like to see you again. Just to...

I'm at Apent Bakeri in Bar code nearly every day.

I work there, I mean. If you want to.

So...

-Eivind?

-Yes.

Your glasses.

Oh, right. Fuck.

Language opens the door to the subconscious.

Freud was a great writer.

He could be self-critical.

He never hesitated to revise his theories.

He viewed each individual patient as a research subject.

Freud didn't distinguish between therapy and research.

I find that very compelling.

Especially these days, when scientific methodology is applied even in the humanities.

Enough about Freud.

How's the movie coming along?

Isn't it almost done?

Yeah, I've seen it, but...

-You have?

-Yes.

It's no longer mine at all.

Is it as bad as you feared?

The worst thing is how they've housebroken Bobcat.

It's all very sanitized and safe.

I'll show you something.

A mock-up of the movie poster.

I have to admit...

I'm embarrassed my name's on it.

Shit.

No! Seriously?

You must be kidding. No way.

That's the poster. For real.

Let's see.

Looks like Chip and Dale.

-Holy shit.

-Should I laugh or cry?

Everything was butchered.

The story. All the details.

They removed the starfish.

Sorry, I'm lost.

What starfish?

It's, you know...

The butthole. The anus.

His butt is smooth in the movie.

This thing is gone.

That's bad in my book.

In underground comics you shit, you puke, you fuck and all that stuff.

Bobcat is a wild cat in a world of domestic cats.

He's a rebel against the bourgeoisie.

One of the most iconic butt holes ever.

-Coffee?

-Yeah.

I don't know what we should do.

I have to go.

Aksel, we need to talk.

Yeah, of course.

What's wrong?

Julie said she'd been thinking.

It wasn't his fault.

Nothing he could have changed.

It's not anything you've done.

It's not your fault. But I feel...

It was about all their old arguments.

Things they both knew.

It was bad timing.

They'd met in different phases of life.

They wanted different things.

We want different things.

Are you leaving me?

Yeah.

I want it to be over.

Are you sure you're yourself right now?

What do you mean?

Do you realize...

Do you realize what you're doing?

What you're destroying?

Yes, of course.

That's why it's so hard.

Where will you live?

-I don't know.

-You don't know?

No. With Mom.

Move home to Mom?

Yeah. Until I find a place.

Okay.

No, come on...

It's over.

I've had it. What else can I say?

Is something else bothering you and you're venting it on me?

No. I've thought about it for a long time.

It feels right.

Have you met someone?

No.

I'm so sick of all this, Julie.

Damn it. Sick to death of it.

But okay.

Just leave. If that's what you want.

I'll take a walk while you pack.

Julie said he deserved a more grounded woman.

Ready for children.

Who was dependable, didn't flake out every six months.

But I like you flaky.

Aksel said he liked her flaky.

That he needed someone like that.

Who could draw him out of his drawing board.

And as for having kids...

He said he'd rather be childless with her

than have kids with anyone else.

You know that's not the only problem.

So what is the problem?

It's a combination of things, not just that.

I can see you're in a crisis right now.

I can understand that.

But if you love me, we'll sort it all out.

Yes, I do love you.

And I don't love you.

Julie felt that this sentence,

the way she said it,

her emphasis on certain words,

summed up the impossibility of it all.

I feel like a spectator in my own life.

Like I'm playing a supporting role in my own life.

I get that you feel stuck.

You need a change.

But is this your solution?

This is exactly my point.

I'm trying to tell you how I feel, and you're defining my feelings.

I see what you're doing.

What am I doing? Tell me what I'm doing.

Shut up, and I'll tell you.

You're acting out the confrontation you never dared have with your father.

-You're taking it out on me.

-Is that so?

What do you know about it?

This is the crux of our relationship.

Everything we feel, we have to put into words.

Sometimes, I just want to feel things.

You insist on being so damn strong all the time.

For you, being strong is about formulating things.

If you analyze things at every psychological level, you think you're strong.

Because I'm less analytical, you think I'm weaker.

She said she was terrified of being alone.

Terrified of living without him.

The! when she left, she '0' be like Bambi on the ice.

And that was precisely why she had to do it.

Aksel mumbled soothing words she didn't hear.

She was thinking about how, at the age of 30,

she'd just compared herself to Bambi.

No.

-I'm pathetic.

-No, you're not.

A bit?

Aksel...

Hey...

I didn't mean what I said.

It's okay. I said plenty of things, too.

Stay a little longer.

You'll regret it.

I'm sure I will.

The saddest thing is, one day, you'll want kids.

In any case, you'll have other relationships.

And you'll realize that what we had was unique.

-I know.

-You don't.

But I do. I've had many relationships.

I know how hard it is.

Nobody communicates like we do.

Laughs like us.

Who knows?

Maybe we'll get back together someday.

Then and there, she meant it.

I mean it.

CHAPTER 6

FINNMARK HIGHLANDS

-Are you cold?

-Yeah.

-It looked easier on YouTube.

-I told you we should practice.

Wait... This one first.

-Are you sure?

-Yes, this goes on top.

Right, but is it first?

Isn't the other one first?

-No, that's the top.

-Okay.

Eivind turned it into a funny story he told everyone.

But it touched something deeper in her.

Awoke something in her.

She googled her family name.

Her grandfather came from the far north.

The DNA sample she sent to America confirmed it.

Eivind didn't see how her new found identity

as 3. 7% Sam/

connected to mind-expanding substances and unrelated exotic rituals,

but tried to be supportive.

As she became increasingly militant,

she saw how climate change was hurting indigenous people.

Inuit starving as seals vanish.

Melting ice ruining reindeer pastures.

Aborigines dying of skin cancer from the hole in the ozone.

Eivind could forget about flying to New York.

Breathe in. All the way up.

She made them live more sustainably.

He could always do better.

Study the ingredients more closely.

Consider the environmental impact of his purchases.

Plastic is killing the oceans.

Norwegian cod was ferried to China and back.

Cobalt mining was destroying the Congo.

Batteries had blood on their hands.

The sum of Western guilt sat beside him on the couch.

Went to bed with him at night.

Everything was weighed against the greater cause.

He felt he was betraying Sunniva.

Betraying the Sami people.

He felt like the world's worst person,

but couldn't resist.

I forgot my sunglasses inside.

-Right.

-Be right back.

CHAPTER 7

A NEW CHAPTER

Eivind didn't want kids either.

Climate researchers foresaw hard times for future generations.

Overpopulation was the reason everything was falling apart.

Julie liked how his pessimism added depth

to his cheerful nature.

But she could tell he had other reasons too.

Eivind's father, like Julie's, tended to forget birthdays.

Eivind would often say,

"According to my father's calendar... "

I'm 12 years old.

They're all hard. No ripe ones.

People die of thirst in Chile because avocados need so much water.

Still following Sunniva on Instagram?

Yeah, she posts interesting links about the environment.

We don't message or anything.

She's got over 30,000 followers.

For showing off her ass?

She's not showing off her ass, she's doing yoga.

It's yoga.

-Okay, she shows it off a bit.

-I don't mind you following her.

It's not a problem, but...

I don't want to be the sensible choice while she's the sexy one.

There's nothing sensible about you.

-I mean...

-Yeah.

-The angle of her pelvis...

-It's yoga.

-That's not yoga.

-It is yoga.

You liked it!

Oh, my God!

-That's not cool!

-I had to like it!

That's right.

So, that's why...

CHAPTER 8

JULIE'S NARCISSISTIC CIRCUS

I want people to watch me dance.

It's annoying as hell.

You can make a fool of yourself on the dance floor and still be cool.

So true! I've noticed that.

When we dance, you take up all the space.

Yeah, but it's also like,

"Everyone look at me!"

Yeah, that's my point.

You're always so mysterious.

You still have this stash?

What's that?

Where'd you find it?

What is it?

Magic mushrooms.

Have you tried it?

Yeah.

Right.

Why'd you do that?

Yuck. Tastes like dirt.

Anyone?

I don't think feel anything.

They're probably too old.

I gotta go.

Are you sure? Could be risky.

Come on, man. We've done this before.

-We'll talk tomorrow.

-Call me.

Adil?

Can you speak?

It's kicking in for him.

Julie? Is it starting to kick in?

You need water. It's important.

You have to drink lots of water.

Here. Drink it all.

You'll be okay.

You know I'm here for you.

Julie? Drink the water.

It's okay! I'm here!

Julie, are you okay?

I thought I'd make it.

Are you okay?

I thought we could use some coffee.

We won't be doing that again.

You should take a shower.

Do I smell bad?

-Is that —

-Oh, my God.

Oh, my God. I need to take a shower.

Don't worry, it's not urgent.

Shall I make breakfast?

I feel I can be myself with you.

Completely.

You weren't yourself before?

I was, but I felt like...

I had to be... a bit... like I was when we first met.

Thanks for putting up with me.

I love you.

CHAPTER 9

BOBCAT WRECKS XMAS

BOBCAT WRECKS XMAS

Have you read your old Bobcat comics since you grew up?

Because in our day and age, they seem so inappropriate and murky that we feel almost sick reading them.

I! is unpleasant to realize you created a character

who gained popularity at the expense of women.

Okay, I get it.

You're saying art should be pleasant?

Do you think it's art?

I brought along some of your early comics.

Bobcat is one thing, but then there's Dick Wolf Dick,

Pedo the Parrot...

Right, I don't really think this is the right medium to explain comic-book humor.

Have you ever considered that some of your readers

may have been victims of incest or rape?

Jeez.

Do we stop creating because some people might feel bad?

Artists get killed for drawing things others find offensive. They're shot.

Are you comparing Mohammed caricatures with drawings of women with big tits?

Or with incest?

What's your point?

Well, yes and no.

It's a bit of a cop-out to claim freedom of speech

when people criticize you.

We're discussing your work right now,

so nobody's censoring you.

As a woman, I'm upset.

I'm offended, though you're not supposed to say that.

You have a choice.

You don't have to feel offended.

It's not a choice.

This is very generational.

One author cannot be held solely responsible.

I think art has to be messy and free.

It has to be a bit dangerous to be fun.

I want art to be a form of therapy where I can express and work through all my unacceptable thoughts, all my darkest impulses.

But you're using your male privilege to mock people weaker than you.

It's hardly art or even humor.

Sorry, it's not smart enough to be satire.

But this isn't about me.

Like, when I create something, it's not just me talking.

-I know that much.

-Do you?

Let is say I draw this interview as a cartoon.

The comic version of me might call you a whore.

It doesn't mean I think that.

It could be a parody of a certain type of insecure male —

-You used the word "whore"?

-Yes, I said "whore."

You're not interested in what I mean.

Can't you see that's crass sexualization?

I think we're on a slippery slope here.

All you post-feminists are so fucking self-righteous!

Thank you, Marthe Refstad and Aksel Willmann.

The term is sex worker now, by the way.

CHAPTER 10

FIRST PERSON SINGULAR

I'M HAPPY TO HELP!

-Long time no see!

-Yeah.

-How are you?

-Okay. And you?

I'm good.

Do you ever talk to Aksel?

-Is he okay?

-Yeah, well...

I heard the radio interview.

Yeah.

He went a bit far.

He's not doing that well.

Did you know he's sick?

-Akse|?

-Haven't you heard? He has cancer.

Sorry, I thought you knew.

It spread quickly.

They discovered it too late.

-Cancer?

-Pancreatic.

But...

How is he coping?

Pretty well, under the circumstances.

But it's hard.

The prognosis... is not good.

It's incurable.

Thanks for letting me know.

I thought you knew.

No, I hadn't heard anything.

It's just...

I didn't know.

When did you write this?

Have you read it?

I was moving it to paper recycling.

It's very good.

-You think?

-Yeah, it sucked me right in.

It's really, really great.

I mean...

It's like...

-What?

-Well...

I have to say, it's really nice to read about you.

But it's not about me.

But the Christmas scene is your family, right?

Yeah, but it's fiction.

You didn't get that?

I made it up.

Okay, it's fiction. In any case...

-It's good.

-Because it's me?

No, because it's nice.

"Nice"?

Yeah, nice. Good. Well written.

The way you write is really great.

Like here,

"Too many memories overlapping, blending into a blur."

That resonates with me.

It's well written. Truly good.

It's not well written.

-What's wrong?

-Suddenly you're into literature.

What was the last book you read?

-Are you okay? What's up?

-Why?

You criticize everything I do these days.

Sorry, but going through my trash is pretty invasive.

-Can't you see that?

-Relax.

-"Relax"?

-Calm down.

Relaxing is your specialty!

You don't mind serving coffee till you're 50.

But I want more!

That's hurtful. I don't know what to say.

CHAPTER 11

POSITIVE

Hello?

Hey...

Have you eaten?

Yeah, but I can make pasta if you like.

No, I don't need any if you've eaten.

Oops, sorry.

It started with a backache.

I've had backaches before. I didn't worry.

Then my skin turned almost golden.

I thought I looked good.

It turned out to be jaundice.

Mom said I was born jaundiced.

They put me in a light box.

-Is it painful?

-No, not really.

It's okay.

They block selected neural pathways with Botox.

That's good.

Yeah, it keeps me from taking too many painkillers.

How's your family doing?

Fine, I guess.

Mom still follows your every move.

And your dad?

I've basically cut him off.

Good.

He can chase me if he likes.

-Does he?

-No, not really.

Two coffees.

They thought it was hilarious.

In some circumstances, morbid humor can be funny.

Even anal sex at a bar mitzvah?

It makes me laugh. But I'm an old guy now.

No.

Well, you know...

I kind of expected this.

I'd given up long before I got sick.

Really.

I just watch my favorite old movies over and over.

Lynch, The Godfather: Part II.

How many “mes can you watch

Dog Day Afternoon'?

Many times.

You should.

Sometimes I listen to music

I haven't heard before.

But...

It's old as well.

Music I didn't know about, but from when I grew up.

It felt as though I'd already given up.

I grew up in an age without Internet and mobile phones.

No, but honestly...

I sound like an old fart.

But I think about it a lot.

The world that I knew... has disappeared.

For me it was all about going to stores.

Record stores.

I'd take the tram to Voices in Grünerlokka.

Leaf through used comics at Pretty Price.

I can close my eyes and see the aisles at Video Nova in Majorstua.

I grew up in a time when culture was passed along through objects.

They were interesting because... we could live among them.

We could pick them up.

Hold them in our hands.

Compare them.

A bit like books?

Yeah, a bit like books.

That's all I have.

I spent my life doing that.

Collecting all that stuff, comics, books...

And...

I just continued, even when it stopped giving me the powerful emotions

I felt in my early 20s.

I continued anyway.

And... now it's all I have left.

Knowledge and memories of stupid, futile things nobody cares about.

Don't say that.

You've got the comics you created.

I wish I'd had what you had.

To be able to draw without doubting that you're doing what you're supposed to do.

I really wish I had that.

Yeah, but...

I've got cancer. I'm dying.

Of course I'm being retrospective.

You said you've done that for ages.

Not for that long.

In recent years.

I reached a point in life where suddenly...

It just happened.

When...

I began to worship what had been.

And now I have nothing else.

I have no future.

I can only look back.

And...

It's not even nostalgia. It's...

Fear of death.

It's because I'm scared.

It has nothing to do with art.

I'm just trying to process...

I have surgery tomorrow at nine.

I felt I could tell you anything.

You wouldn't judge me.

You're the least judgmental person I know.

I don't have anyone I can talk to the way we used to talk.

Can you tell me what you used to tell me?

I hated hearing it at the time, but you can tell me.

I'll be a good mother?

Are you pregnant?

Congratulations?

How do you feel? Good or bad?

I don't know.

I'm not sure.

It was an accident.

I must've been careless.

I mean, clearly I was.

Were you really sure?

Sure you wanted kids?

I was scared too.

I had my doubts, of course.

But I didn't want to show them, to keep you from...

I never doubted you'd make a good mother.

I saw that you doubted it.

İf I regret one thing, it's that I never managed... to make you see how wonderful you are.

What are you thinking?

This is hard to hear.

But... will you keep it?

I don't know.

I wasted so much time worrying about what could go wrong.

But what did go wrong, was never the things I worried about.

If he's a kind man, then go for it.

With a kind father, and you as the mother, everything will be fine.

Your voice has stayed in my head.

We still have great conversations.

No way?

About what?

Mostly about comics.

Eclectic tastes.

Same here.

I have imaginary conversations with you.

I'm sure I remember things about you that you've forgotten.

And the other way around.

Yeah, maybe.

When I'm gone, all that stuff about you will go with me.

May I ask you a question?

Had you already met him when you broke up with me?

Yeah.

Why didn't you tell me?

I don't know.

I didn't dare.

And now you're breaking up with him?

No, why do you say that?

Maybe because you don't seem happy about the baby.

And that's what you do when things get tough.

I'm glad I'm pregnant.

I'm sorry.

It's alright.

You were the most important relationship in my life.

You don't have to say anything.

I know it's not the same for you.

That's normal.

You have many years left to live.

But I know, I feel it.

And I want you to know.

You were the love of my life.

You're a damn good person.

I should've told you before.

But I couldn't.

I'm pregnant.

How long have you known?

I know we don't want kids.

No...

I don't know if I do.

I feel like I never see anything through.

I go from one thing to another.

I need time to think about all this.

About us.

It's okay.

CHAPTER 12

EVERYTHING COMES TO AN END

That's where I lived.

We moved there when I was eight.

Shall we knock?

No. I don't think so.

What do you remember from here?

I remember these colors.

They were always my reference when I drew my comics.

These colors.

And I remember the local drunk, who was super nice.

I'm so tired of pretending everything is okay.

It sucks being in so much pain. It sucks.

Everything sucks.

And...

I don't want to be a memory for you.

I don't want to be a voice in your head.

I don't want to live on through my art.

I want to live in my flat.

I want to live...

I want to live in my flat with you.

I want to be happy together.

Bye.

Bye.

Hi, Julie.

Aksel's condition has suddenly worsened.

He's too ill for his planned treatment.

He may not make it through the night.

His family is with him, but I thought you should know.

EPILOGUE

There's nothing more to say.

Cut!

One more.

One more quick take. Slight adjustment.

Be sadder.

Okay. But he gets up so quickly.

Hey!

Okay, camera ready.

-Action!

-There's nothing more to say.

Cut! Great. Let's move on.

Right, Stills.

Sorry, I need some shots of you.

-Sure. Here?

-Yeah.

-Are you okay?

-Yeah.

But I think I was pretty terrible.

Then use that.

Hold on to that feeling.

Act like you're looking at him.





# Benediction     

 The audience

pricks an intellectual ear.

Stravinsky quite the concert of the year.

Forgetting now the hullabaloo they made,

the audience pricks an intellectual ear.

Bassoons begin,

sonority envelopes our auditory innocence,

and brings to me,

I must admit,

some drift of things omnific, seminal, and adolescent.

Men in boaters, far from Henley,

girls in pink and blue taffeta.

In that long summer,

I hunted, played cricket, but only watched tennis.

God was in His heaven

{\an8}and there were sausages for breakfast.

And in small recruiting offices,

dull young men wait to inscribe in paper quires,

the names of the living and the dead.

Mr Sassoon.

Yes.

I'm Siegfried.

And I'm Hamo, younger brother.

And we've both come for our fitting.

Just so, sir.

I think we should start with the shirts.

You can't have your shirts too dark, sir.

Ah, war! A la mode!

 I never said goodbye to him.

On the idle hill of summer,

sleepy with the flow of streams,

far I hear the steady drummer,

drumming like a noise in dreams.

Far and near and low and louder,

on the roads of Earth go by,

dear to friends and food for powder,

soldiers marching, all to die.

East and west in fields forgotten

bleach the bones of comrades slain.

Lovely lads and dead and rotten.

None that go return again.

Far the calling bugles hollo,

high the screaming fife replies.

Gay the files of scarlet follow:

Woman bore me, I will rise.

I was anxious to know what you were suffering from.

It's only trench fever, nothing fatal, just debilitating.

I dread everything now.

The telephone... the telegram.

There's only one thing worse than remaining in the past, Mother, and that's begrudging the future.

The future, without either of my sons, is to be dreaded, not enjoyed.

 I am writing you this private letter

with the greatest possible regret.

I must inform you that it is my intention

to refuse to perform any further military duties.

I am doing this as a protest

against the policy of the government

in prolonging the war

by failing to state their conditions for peace.

I have written a statement of my reasons,

of which I enclose a copy.

I am making this statement

as an act of wilful defiance of military authority

because I believe that the war

is being deliberately prolonged

by those who have the power to end it.

I am a soldier

convinced that I am acting on behalf of soldiers.

I believe that the war upon which I entered

as a war of defence and liberation

has now become a war of aggression and conquest.

I believe that the purpose for which I and my fellow soldiers

entered upon this war

should have been made so clearly stated

as to have made it impossible to change them.

And that had this been done, the objects that actuated us

would now be attainable by negotiation.

I have seen and endured the sufferings of the troops

and I can no longer be a party

to prolong these sufferings for ends

which I believe to be evil and unjust.

I am not protesting against the conduct of the war,

but against the political errors

and insincerities for which

the fighting men are being sacrificed.

On behalf of those who are suffering now,

I make this protest against the deception

which is being practised upon them.

Also, I believe it may help to destroy

the callous complacency

with which the majority of those at home

regard the continuance of agonies

which they do not share

and which they have not enough imagination to realize.

I suppose this was your doing.

Yes, and Eddie Marsh.

I take this very ill, Robbie.

Why did you involve Marsh?

Because he's Principal Private

Secretary to Winston Churchill and he wanted to help.

He was instrumental in getting you a Medical Board examination instead of a court martial.

If you were found guilty at a court martial, you could be shot.

That was a risk

I was prepared to take.

But there are those who care for you and who were not.

A court martial would have been a platform to state my opposition to the conduct of the war, and you have prevented me doing so.

And not only for this Times article but for my statement to be read out on the floor of the House.

You've rendered me impotent, Robbie.

You've robbed me of my dignity.

Better that than a firing squad.

That is a matter of opinion.

Don't be angry with me, Siegfried.

My intentions were honourable.

An old cowpoke went ridin' out

One dark and windy day

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way

When all at once, a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw

A-ploughing through the ragged skies

And up a cloudy draw

Yippee-yi-ay

Yippee-yi-oh

The ghost herd in the sky

Their brands were still on fire

And their hooves were made of steel

Their horns were black and shiny

And their hot breath he could feel

A bolt of fear went through him

As they thundered through the sky

For he saw the riders coming hard

And he heard their mournful cries

Yippee-yi-ay

Yippee-yi-oh

Ghost riders in the sky

As the riders loped on by him

He heard one call his name

If you wanna save your soul from hell

A-riding on our range

Then, cowboy change your ways today

Or with us you will ride

Trying to catch the devil's herd

Across these endless skies

Yippee-yi-ay

Yippee-yi-oh

Yippee-yi-oh

Yippee-yi-oh

Ghost riders in the sky

Yippee-yi-ay

Yippee-yi-oh

I'm intrinsically against any kind of conversion.

It's too much like wishful thinking.

Besides, in a poet, it seems to imply he has nothing interesting left to say.

I said I was only thinking about it.

Surely you're not looking for God?

That's one way of putting it.

Well, speaking as one of the spiritually-undernourished, if you find him, make sure he's still an Englishman, doesn't live on the wrong side of the park.

I assume that was supposed to be amusing.

Why Catholicism, Father?

Something permanent, unchanging.

You can get that from dressage but without the guilt.

There is no need to be snide.

If all you can do is ridicule, it would be better if you remained silent.

Better still, go outside and wait in the car.

Well, it's a long drive back to London, so the sooner we can get started, the better.

 Siegfried,

what do you ask of the Church of God?

 Faith.

 What does faith offer you?

Life everlasting.

 If you then desire to enter into life,

keep the commandments.

"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart

"and with thy whole soul and with thy whole mind."

Siegfried, do you renounce Satan?

I do renounce him.

And all his works?

I do renounce him.

And all his pomps?

I do renounce him.

Receive this burning light and keep thy baptism so as to be without blame.

Keep the commandments of God, that when the Lord shall come to the nuptials, thou mayest meet Him together with all the Saints in the heavenly court, and mayest thou have eternal life for ever and ever.

Siegfried, go in peace and the Lord be with you.

The fool hath said in his heart there is no God.

You will be drawn up in your feelings

above understanding

to the radiance of divine darkness

that transcends all being.

Christ, receive my soul

and release me from the imprisonment of doubt.

And grant me peace.

 I'm quite appalled by what you've done.

I can only hope your CO in Liverpool

will ignore your letter.

I'm terrified that you will be put under arrest.

We read your statement,

Lieutenant, with some alarm.

You may sit if you wish, Lieutenant.

Thank you, sir.

Why did you make it?

I wanted to state my position regarding the conduct of the war.

It is not your place to question how the war is being prosecuted.

Your duty lies in obeying orders.

Duty?

That word covers a multitude of sins.

In the face of such slaughter, one cannot simply order one's conscience.

One can do better than that.

One can ignore it.

That reply was so disgraceful, you ought to be in politics.

That was impertinent,

Lieutenant.

Are you pro-German?

No. I'm pro-human.

We are not here to discuss humanity, that is religion's sphere of operations.

And what of morality?

Morality is a luxury that we can only afford during peace time.

I would be very grateful if you would take that offensive tone out of your voice.

Voices raised in anger only perpetuates war.

And passive resistance only invites defeat.

I simply cannot remain silent in the face of such casualties.

Someone must, should be brought to book.

The casualties, young man, are a matter for the

Imperial General Staff.

And your statement, indeed your entire attitude, is both offensive and detrimental to military discipline.

My colleague is quite right.

It is not your place to question your superiors, much less to imply that they are not honourable.

Perhaps, sir, if you, if any of you were to visit the front, then you might at least spare a thought for the many bereaved families and the pain they suffer.

You are out of order, sir!

I thought that was the very reason for my being brought before you.

This has gone far enough.

Yes, of course.

Yes, I agree.

Myself and my fellow officers feel that your mind is still in chaos and that you are unfit to be trusted with men's lives.

It is therefore the Board's decision that you should be sent to a hospital for nervous diseases in Scotland.

We therefore order you to report immediately

to Craiglockhart, in Edinburgh.

Good morning, Lieutenant.

You may leave your coat and luggage here.

A porter will take them up to your room.

 Name?

Sassoon, Siegfried.

 Rank?

- Second Lieutenant.

- Age?

 30.

Years of complete service?

 Two years, eleven months.

Completed months

with Field Force?

 Thirteen months.

Disease?

I've had some sort of breakdown.

Nervous debility?

Yes, I believe that's what they call it.

Enter it as neurasthenia, Matron.

As we came in, sir,

I noticed several men with blue dots on their faces.

Morphine.

Morphine?

The dots denote that they've had their doses, so that they are given no more until the appropriate time.

Who will be treating this man?

- Doctor Rivers.

- Rivers' office is next door.

I think it would be polite if you introduced yourself.

Yes, sir.

And in your room, you will find an armband.

It is to be worn at all times, especially outside the hospital grounds.

It is to show that you are a serving soldier in hospital and not a conscientious objector.

We wouldn't want you to be attacked in Princes Street, now, would we?

Which arm shall I wear it on, sir?

The pleasure of that choice, Lieutenant, is entirely yours.

Your room is on the upper floor at the end of the corridor.

Dismissed.

Hmm?

Sassoon, Siegfried,

Lieutenant.

Your burgeoning fame precedes you.

I enjoyed The Old Huntsman

very much.

You may not know, but we have a house magazine, The Hydra.

I'm sure it would welcome a contribution from you.

Well, I'll, erm, try to write something light and amusing.

Oh, there's no need to go that far.

You have an appointment to see me at 10:30 in the morning.

Dear Mother, have arrived in Dottyville.

Wish you were here.

Good morning, Doctor.

Good morning, Sassoon.

Please, sit down.

We're quite relaxed here.

Although we do seem to go through rather too many chief medical officers, some are more flexible than others.

Then they're replaced by someone who wants everything to be as taut as Aldershot.

Then they too are replaced.

And what's your persuasion?

Oh, I prefer a certain measure of laxity.

One can't be at attention forever, it plays havoc with the nerves.

From the, er, little I know of your method of treatment here,

I understand that from whatever I say you can deduce whether or not my grandmother was a dipsomaniac.

Was she?

Alas, no, no.

Just a sweet sherry at

Christmas and on birthdays.

Well done, your grandmother.

She didn't know what she wasn't missing.

Well, just tell me whatever it is you want me to do, and I'll comply with your wishes.

It isn't a question of what I want.

It's a question of what you think you need.

Am I to start? Or do you?

Is there anything you feel you wish to say?

What I feel cannot be talked away or soothed into silence.

Why?

Too many have died.

Too much has been destroyed.

There can be an easement of pain.

A move towards acceptance.

Pain is not the only terror.

There are many more.

Can you name them?

If I could name them, they would cease to be terrors.

That's a very elegant way of avoiding an answer.

All evasions are elegant.

Think of politics.

I've always thought that politicians were too stupid to be subtle.

Perhaps they're just too subtle to be inelegant.

Are you a good soldier?

Passable.

I was a poor marksman.

I never knew which eye to shut.

I understand you were awarded the MC.

Yes.

It's supposed to signify gallantry.

Bravery is only cowardice in extremis.

At the root of bravery lies terror and the fear of fear.

But you were conspicuous by your courage.

Why did you discard the Military Cross?

Disgust at my own dwindling standards and the men I felt

I had betrayed.

It was nothing short of duplicity.

And yet the men under your command held you in the highest esteem, I'm told.

And I them.

They seemed to me to be all that was good and true in this world.

Are you searching for truth?

Isn't everyone?

And if you find it, what then?

Peace of mind, contentment.

No longer yearning for what's been lost.

Loveliest of trees

The cherry now

Is hung with bloom

Along the bough

And stands about

The woodland ride

Wearing white

For Eastertide

Come in.

Lieutenant Sassoon?

Yes.

I'm Wilfred Owen.

There was howling last night.

Like a wolf.

Strictly speaking, wolves ululate.

But howling will do.

Now, don't make light of it like that, Doctor, please.

That isn't what I'm doing.

I'm merely keeping it in perspective.

I'm sorry if I sounded uncaring.

His screams were terrible.

Worse than an animal.

Such anguish in them.

Why do all the worst terrors come at night?

The night is, I think, like the unconscious.

Waiting all day so that it can steal over you in the dark.

You make it sound almost benign.

Perhaps it is.

I believe Wilfred Owen introduced himself to you the other day.

Yes.

He seems so gentle.

Feel rather protective of him.

Does that protectiveness hide something deeper?

Yes.

All my friendships do.

But I've never allowed my emotions to mar or spoil them,

I remain passive.

It's how I cope.

You never act on impulse?

No, never.

I'm unable to take risks.

It's the hero in me.

Why not?

Too afraid, too inhibited.

Shamed by an inner corruption.

Or perhaps it's simply because of...

What's the phrase?

"The love that dare not speak its name."

You are not alone in that respect.

Frankly, Doctor,

I'm surprised.

Why?

The world is full of anomalies.

Well, speaking as one anomaly to another, how do you cope with the law?

I adopt a less than honest respect for it.

So evasion is not confined solely to second lieutenants?

No, it affects all ranks.

I trust after this disclosure, you will be discreet.

Discretion is my middle name.

Well, it's better than Ethel anyway.

One assumes these theatricals have some deeper purpose.

Well, sir, I think they help to give some sort of ease away from the front line.

I doubt that.

Should the enemy perceive that the British Army is always preparing for a tango, the war is lost.

Besides, the spectacle of men dancing with men is never palatable.

I had always thought such creatures went into the library with their service revolvers and did the decent thing.

And how is your treatment progressing, Lieutenant?

Oh, it has its unique moments, sir.

Well, let us hope these unique moments coalesce enough to get you back to active service, fighting fit, as it were.

Doesn't that rather depend, sir, on what's fit to fight for?

But perhaps

I'm just being syndromatic.

Or is that a lapsus linguae?

I beg your pardon?

Lapsus linguae, sir.

Slip of the tongue.

I know what it means,

Lieutenant.

The rest of us may be unable to read Beowulf

in the original, but we're not all complete Philistines.

Of course not, sir.

Carry on.

-Ready?

-Yes.

 Halitosis!

Halitosis!

Your first poem in Hydra.

Long live the editor!

I am the editor.

Hooray for nepotism!

And what do you think of my verse, Siegfried?

It seemed a little too dependent on 19th century models.

You make it sound like

The Courtship of Miles Standish.

Oh, God, no.

Nothing's ever as bad as that.

But you do find my work derivative?

While I was at Clare,

I wasted far too much time reading Swinburne.

It was very bad for my adjectives.

You have to speak directly, not with another's voice.

Look, at first, everyone's work is derivative.

We all have to start somewhere.

At Cambridge, apart from Swinburne,

I did nothing except read

William Morris in a punt and staggered through Maud.

Perhaps, er, my latest effort will please you.

It's called Disabled.

It's magnificent.

It pierces the heart.

What a gift you have.

I have been passed by the Medical Board as fit for active service.

When do you rejoin your regiment?

December.

Just before Christmas.

Oh.

 There was I waiting at the church

Waiting at the church

Waiting at the church

When I found he left me in the lurch

Lord, how it did upset me

All at once he sent me round a note

Here's the very note

This is what he wrote

"Can't get away to marry you today

"My wife won't let me"

There was I

Waiting at the church

Waiting at the church

Waiting at the church

When I found he left me in the lurch

Lord, how it did upset me

All at once he sent me round a note

Here's the very note

This is what he wrote

"Can't get away to marry you today

"My wife won't let me"

What is it, Siegfried?

Nothing.

Wilfred's about to return to duty.

I know.

What will you do?

Nothing.

I will not do anything to make the parting even more painful.

I'd give everything I possess to have him stay just one more hour.

One more minute.

Quick to tears, slow to love.

You know, when I first met him, he had a slight stammer.

And spoke, I thought, with a grammar school accent.

How could I be such a snob?

He really is a lovely man.

And I think the greater poet.

What about your poetry?

It's egotism, really.

That seems a little harsh.

Truth often is.

I have no idea why I come here.

It's really done no good at all, this.

Think of it as a cleansing of the soul.

Why do you have to put it so beautifully?

Will you stay just for a few more moments?

Yes.

Whenever you're ready, sir.

 Wilfred was killed

just a week before the war ended.

What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?

Only the monstrous anger of the guns.

Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle

can patter out their hasty orisons.

No mockeries for them from prayers or bells,

nor any voice of mourning,

save the choir's.

The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells

and bugles calling for them from sad shires.

What candles may be held to speed them all?

Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes

shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes.

The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall,

their flowers, the tenderness of silent minds,

and each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.

The woman posing, who appears to be wearing a spinnaker is Lady Ottoline Morrell.

More hair than self-restraint, but definitely nobody's fool.

She looks as though she hasn't heard a joke since the Boer War.

For Ottoline, the Boer War was the joke.

Ottoline.

May we pause for a moment, Dorothy,

-before rigor mortis sets in?

-Of course, Ottoline.

Who is this extremely beautiful young man, Robbie?

Sassoon, Siegfried.

It sounds Wagnerian.

It's just Home Counties,

I'm afraid.

So you are not a keeper of the flame at Bayreuth?

No, no, I'm afraid not.

What are your musical tastes then?

Er, Ravel, Albeniz, Chausson.

Scriabin, if I must.

Cesar Franck, when I'm in the mood.

And Bartok?

Oh, no. Never Bartok, no.

His music always sounds to me like a lunatic playing the xylophone.

Vice versa.

I once heard Paderewski play

Bartok at Tunbridge Wells, but I found it rather disappointing.

Well, what did you expect, Robbie?

It was Tunbridge Wells.

Come into the main house and have tea.

May I join you, Ottoline?

Of course. Dorothy, you are not a servant, but an honourable.

Now come along, Mr Bassoon, and tell me what you really have against Mr Bartok.

Not a great deal.

I just don't like his music.

 Oh, a word into your shell-like,

she'll ask you to stay the night.

She always asks attractive young men to stay the night.

So lock your bedroom door

or wear something very, very severe.

I thought that I might be more interesting than cocoa.

I'm afraid I prefer cocoa.

Sleep badly.

 Dickie. Curse the Wood! It's time to go.

 O Christ, what's the good?

We'll never take it, and it's always raining.

 They snipe like hell!

O Dickie, don't go out!

 I fell asleep.

Next morning, he was dead.

And some slight wound lay smiling on the bed.

Ivor Novello... of Keep The Home-Fires Burning

fame.

Hmm, yes.

That loathsome little tune.

Ah, he always writes at the top of his voice, but we must try to be charitable.

Ah, Sybil, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

Ragtime indeed.

Yes, I know.

But Mr Novello plays it so well, it's almost music.

Besides, at the moment, he's appearing in the West End in a very successful play called The Rat.

I know.

Someone asked me if it was autobiographical, but I said I wasn't sure.

One day, Robbie, you will go too far.

Oh, one day, Sybil, we will all go too far.

Thank you for coming,

Mr Sassoon.

We're all very eager to hear your recitation.

Thank you, Lady Colefax.

Ladies and gentlemen, pray silence for one of our greatest poets,

Mr Siegfried Sassoon.

When I'm among a blaze of lights, with tawdry music and cigars and women dawdling through delights and officers in cocktail bars, sometimes I think of garden nights and elm trees nodding at the stars.

I dream of a small fire-lit room.

Yellow candles burning straight, and glowing pictures in the gloom, and kindly books that hold me late.

Of things like these

I choose to think when I can never be alone.

And then someone says,

"Another drink," and turns my living heart to stone.

Hmm.

Thank you, Mr Sassoon.

That was very touching.

We both thank you, Sybil, and now go and rejoin Lady Cunard before she starts launching something.

And to think he once played the triangle so beautifully.

What a waste.

 I seem to be the victim of a cruel jest

It dogs my footsteps with the girl I love the best

She's just the sweetest thing that I have ever known

And yet we never get the chance to be alone

My car will meet her and her mother comes, too

It's a two-seater

Still her mother comes, too

At Ciro's when I am free at dinner, supper or tea

She loves to shimmy with me

And her mother does, too

We buy her trousseau

And her mother comes, too

Asked not to do so

Still her mother comes, too

She simply can't take a snub

I go and sulk at the club

Then have a bath and a rub

And her brother comes, too

To golf we started

And her mother came, too

Three bags I carted

When her mother came, too

She fainted just off the tee

My darling whispered to me

"Jack dear, at last we are free"

But her mother came, too

He is considered very beautiful.

Look at those shoulders.

Yeah, and look at his.

Are we leaving, Ivor?

No, precious.

I'm anxious to meet our distinguished guest,

Mr Sassoon.

I'm eager to have your advice on my next musical.

I'm thinking of writing in terza rima.

That's near Naples, isn't it?

Oh, dear Robbie, whose silences are always so much more eloquent than speech.

Robbie will give you a paw to guide you home, Glen.

- C'est la vie.

C'est la guerre.

Oops.

Just leave the keys on the dresser, Glen.

You know how absent-minded

I am with them.

I think he's still in love with you.

The main drawback with love is that it descends, all too quickly, into possessiveness.

That really is a bore.

What shall I do with these?

Oh, they're for you.

Hamo died so far away.

While I have his sword,

I still have him.

We never grieved properly for him, Mother.

Before grief, there's anger.

 I watch you on your constant way,

in selfless duty long grown grey.

and to myself,

I say that I have lived my life to learn

how lives like your unasking earn.

Aureoles that guide and burn

in heart's remembrance

when the proud who snared the suffrage of the crowd

are dumb and dusty browed.

For you live onward in my thought

because you have not sought rewards that can be bought.

And so when I remember you,

I think of all things rich and true

that I have reaped and wrought.

Thank God you survived.

Good night, darling.

Good night, Mother.

Give me your hand, my brother.

Search my face.

Look in these eyes lest I should think of shame.

For we have made an end of all things base.

We are returning by the road we came.

Your lot is with the ghosts of soldiers dead,

and I am in the field where men must fight.

But in the gloom,

I see your laurelled head

and through your victory

I shall win the light.

Sleep in heavenly peace

3,500 copies of

Counter-Attack sold.

Your fame is spreading, Siegfried.

Like a virus?

Oh, don't be contrary.

So I wake up famous.

Like Byron.

And I believe you've been overwhelmed by visits from all the great and the good.

Mmm.

Massine, Lydia Lopokova,

Keynes,

Winston Churchill and mother.

Even "boy actor" Noel Coward.

Have I left anyone out?

The Pope.

That's right, Siegfried, think small.

How did you find Mr Churchill?

Imperial.

And Mr Coward?

Gushing.

What would you have done if Royalty had paid a call?

Oh, well, then I'd have tried to curtsey from a sitting position.

Speaking of Royalty,

I've come with a command from Her Majesty

Edith Sitwell.

You are to attend a performance at Carlyle Square of her Entertainment-Façade.

Poetry, by Edith.

Music, Willie Walton.

I've gone to a great deal of trouble to get this so don't let me down.

If you don't attend,

La Sitwell has threatened to come to your flat at Half Moon Street and hum the whole of Tannhauser to you.

You have been warned.

Oh, I, er...

Ottoline Morell popped in and wished to be remembered to you.

How was she?

Let's just say I've always found lime green a very unforgiving colour.

Poor Ottoline.

She'll go to her grave overdressed.

I'm looking forward to meeting your mother.

What?

I said I was looking forward to meeting your mother.

All mothers, good or bad are always fascinating.

I tried to set fire to mine once, but she was all asbestos.

Oh, do come on!

We shall never get down to Kent at this rate.

Oh, and I found this for you on the floor.

Oh, it'll be from Robbie Ross.

Why are you so antipathetic towards him?

Because I resent the way that he speaks to me.

Like he's always putting me in my place.

You know, the only problem with knowing one's place is that other people never seem to know theirs.

He's acerbic, I grant you, but he's never malign, and as a friend, very steadfast.

Robbie Ross took some considerable risk when he publicly supported

Oscar Wilde.

He's been hounded ever since by Lord Alfred Douglas.

Oh, please,

Bosie was always vindictive.

Robbie should have known that from the beginning.

He's really only got himself to blame.

That's really unfair.

His loyalty to Wilde was exemplary.

All right, all right.

Robbie's a saint.

Now, how about we drop the subject?

Oh, that's a very fine sword.

It was my brother's.

Hmm.

He was killed at Gallipoli.

Oh, God.

What is it?

It's the first performance of Façade, and I was supposed to go to it.

Well, where's it being performed?

Some private performance in Carlyle Square.

Chelsea.

Well, even if we drove like the wind, we should never make it.

Robbie will be furious.

And so will Edith Sitwell.

It's being given to a very select audience.

I'm sure she'll understand once you explain why you weren't able to be there.

Oh, no,

I don't think so, Mother.

Edith can be a very captious woman.

She isn't a woman.

She's an animated meringue.

And those teeth.

Don't be horrible, Ivor.

She suffers, I believe, from a complaint known as receding gums.

She's so autocratic,

I'm surprised she gave them permission to.

Oh, well, come along then.

Might as well see if we can catch some of it.

I'm sorry to have to rush off like this, Mother.

It doesn't matter.

Is he just another one of your pretty boys?

No, it's deeper than that, much deeper.

You don't like him, do you, Mother?

He's amusing, but unpleasant.

It's his eyes.

I think they're cruel.

Good night, Mother.

Good night, Siegfried.

You never came.

Please forgive me, Edith.

I shall try.

I'm entirely to blame.

We visited my mother in Kent and I simply lost all sense of time.

- We?

- Mmm.

Myself and Ivor Novello.

A man at the cheaper end of poetry.

I do hope you can forgive me, Edith, for I am mortified by my thoughtlessness.

How was the work received?

They tittered.

Tittered?

Tittered.

I overheard someone say, in the most odious manner,

"It's this sort of thing

"that makes one glad to be semi-conscious."

- I was deeply wounded.

- Hmm.

My poetry has wonderful assonances and dissonances.

I use words for their colour, not merely for what they are supposed to mean.

Great art may sometimes be so ahead of its time, Edith, that its initial reception can be considered a succès d'estime.

Think of Stravinsky.

But I do not wish to think of Stravinsky.

We are performing Façade

at the Aeolian Hall next week.

I shall expect you there.

Of course, Edith.

I shall come with the speed of a thousand gazelles.

No need for hyperbole,

Siegfried.

A taxi will do.

In the early springtime after their tea, through the young fields of the springing Bohea,

Jemima, Jocasta, Dinah and Deb walked with their father

Sir Joshua Jebb.

An admiral red whose only notion, a butterfly poised on a pigtailed ocean is of the peruked sea whose swell breaks on the flowerless rocks of Hell.

For Hell is just as properly proper, as Greenwich, or as Bath, or Joppa!

Oh, Christ!

I have to go backstage.

Rather you than me.

Ah.

The prodigal.

Well, Edith, you've done it again.

All the fine young cannibals.

You make it sound like a raiding party.

Isn't it?

Stephen Tennant.

I am...

Yes, we already know who you are, Stephen.

But who is this absolute dream in oyster grey silk?

Hester Gatty.

Lady Gatty's daughter?

Yes.

She once invited you to Carlton House Terrace.

But you hardly noticed me.

Then I apologize for my lack of taste.

We're great admirers of your poetry, Siegfried.

Before you take offence, Ivor, we like your work, too.

Careful, Stephen, that was almost enthusiasm.

Perhaps they will play one of your charming songs,

Mr Novello, and then we can dance to it.

I can't tempt Stephen, though.

Why not?

Because I only do the valeta and only when pressed.

I do love dancing.

So do I.

Come on, then.

Whoo!

I didn't know great poets did the Charleston.

I didn't know the Charleston did that to gay young things.

I think everyone should be gay, don't you?

Only in the wider sense.

And this young man is...

Alexander Fenton.

Doesn't it sound as though it should have a title in front of it?

Sir Alexander Fenton.

For his services to the theatre.

Well, that hasn't happened yet.

It will, Ivor.

It will.

I hardly see you these days, Ivor.

How are you?

Horizontally speaking.

Oh, busy, old thing.

Very, very busy.

Still gathering lilacs?

You could say that.

Well, when you've exhausted botany, you might consider moving into the field of blood sports.

I'm told that the men who indulge in them are very, very rugged.

Isn't that so, Mr Sassoon?

You know, I think that's what

I'm going to miss most about you, Glen, your quaint sense of humour.

And how have you been passing your time?

Seeing lots of musical theatre.

Mmm, such as?

Rose-Marie, very enjoyable.

Yes, but so Rudolph Friml-ly.

But it is by Rudolph Friml.

It was a joke, Siegfried.

And how about tonight?

Lady, Be Good!

Gershwin, an unsurpassed genius.

Oh, we really mustn't keep you then, Glen.

You have to admit it,

Gershwin is an exceptional talent.

I don't have to admit anything.

What's wrong?

We're leaving.

But I thought you wanted supper.

I'm no longer hungry!

Name, sir?

Mr Sassoon.

Sassoon, you say.

-Yes.

-Oh.

Hmm.

Would you mind spelling it for me, please, sir?

S-A-S-S-O-O-N.

Hmm.

I'm afraid you're not on the list, sir.

Well, I'm going up anyway.

Telephone me in a couple of days, won't you?

I practically had to force my way in past the stage doorman.

Hmm. You were lucky.

He's been told to shoot anyone not on my list.

Why wasn't I on the list?

Oh, for Christ's sake!

Look, it's been a long run, Siegfried.

I am tired.

I am exhausted.

-You still want supper?

-Yes!

I'm surprised to see

Fenton here.

Why?

I know lots of people.

-Fenton is just another...

-Admirer.

...fan.

You both seemed to me to be very friendly after so short an acquaintance.

Now, I get the distinct impression that I am being grilled.

And that a storm in an egg cup is brewing.

I'm sorry, I don't mean to be petty, but I am...

I am very jealous of you.

Yes, well, affairs are always messy.

Who can know the secrets of a human heart?

Usually the people who don't have one.

Oh, my, my, hasn't it gone chilly in here?

But I love you.

Yes, you've said.

Ivor.

Ivor.

Let me pass.

I'm sorry, sir.

I can't let you go up.

Why?

Mr Novello never sees anyone after a matinee.

Well, would you please inform Mr Novello that I've booked a table for 8 PM?

And I'll be expecting him for dinner!

Yes, sir.

Thank you.

Is there someone else?

There's always someone else.

How do you justify your behaviour?

By asking myself questions to which I already know the answers.

And when all is said and done, my career comes before anyone or anything.

And my work is as popular as I am.

There is a school of thought that regards musical theatre as a second-rate means of expression.

Before you judge other people's work, Siegfried,

I would make sure your own is above criticism.

- What does that mean?

- Just this, that since 1918, your poetry has gone from the sublime to the meticulous.

And tell me, Mr Novello, what did you do during the war?

I gave my talent to my country.

I boosted morale by playing every theatre in the land!

Oh, weren't you the lucky one!

We had the Somme and you had Rhyl!

Well, I see no point in prolonging this unpleasant conversation.

No.

Oh, no.

After what's been said,

I don't expect you to foot the bill as well.

Oh, always the gentleman, eh, Siegfried?

It's better than being a cad.

I suspect this is goodbye then.

Au revoir

might have been kinder.

Please don't undermine yourself, Siegfried.

That's what friends are for.

If you wish to see me again,

I'll be at my flat.

Well, at least that's more original than going home to mother.

Snap.

May I sit down?

Yes, of course.

Do you still dine here?

-Of course.

-Why?

Let's just say I like the trips down memory lane.

What next?

Well, I suppose, in a bad melodrama, I'd kill myself.

And in a really bad melodrama, you kill Ivor.

Seriously, are you all right?

The moment passes, but the hurt remains.

And I was supposed to go and visit my mother and now I've missed the train.

Drive down, why don't you?

I have no car. I can't drive.

I was going to motor down to the coast.

Why don't I give you a lift?

That would be very kind of you.

Where does she live?

Kent.

Then let's get going.

I have absolutely no idea where we are.

Although I, erm, don't possess the wit to woo, may I see you again?

I live in Margate.

Oh.

Pity Margate is so far away.

It's not at the moment.

What about Ivor?

Oh.

Ivor's already been to Margate.

 At dawn, the ridge emerges massed and dun

in wild purple of the glow'ring sun,

smouldering through spouts of drifting smoke

that shroud the menacing scarred slope.

And, one by one,

tanks creep and topple forward to the wire.

The barrage roars and lifts.

Then, clumsily bowed with bombs

and guns and battle-gear,

men jostle and climb to meet the bristling fire.

Lines of grey, muttering faces, masked with fear,

they leave their trenches, going over the top,

while time ticks blank and busy on their wrists,

and hope, with furtive eyes and grappling fists,

flounders in the mud.

O Jesus, make it stop.

We have a guest.

Oh, he's not a guest.

He's an afterthought.

This is my life partner,

Bobby Andrews.

Bobby, Siegfried.

Siegfried, Bobby.

Well, don't look so shocked.

Love has nothing to do with monogamy.

Or are you the faithful type?

I suppose I must be.

If you want fidelity,

Siegfried, buy a pet.

You kept very quiet about this.

Well, that's because

I didn't want anyone else to shake him down from the tree.

You really are a bastard, aren't you?

I do my best.

Now you must excuse us.

We have a casserole waiting.

Oh.

Where shall I put your key?

Back on the floor.

I can't face tea before 11 AM.

Drink it, you misery.

I don't do this for everyone, you know.

I'm the invalid, remember?

Like Chekhov.

Oh, what should I do about my hair?

Have you considered topiary?

I think I might dye it.

Or I could leave it in its natural colour.

When I'm sunburnt, it looks like spun gold.

I'll be with you in a moment.

It's Glen Byam Shaw.

Isn't that good news?

Siggy will be down in a trice.

He's suitably undressed.

We've just been talking about you.

So I hope your ears were burning, all three of them.

Is Stephen naturally unpleasant or does he take private tuition?

I heard that!

You were supposed to.

Siggy! Siggy!

I'm sorry.

What can I say?

There's nothing to say.

It's one of the inconveniences of the shadow life we lead.

Friends may come, friends may go.

Enemies are always faithful.

How is Ivor?

I have no idea.

I don't see him any more.

Did you know about Bobby?

Yes.

You might have warned me.

I didn't want to seem vindictive.

Sour grapes and all that.

I wanted to tell you personally that I'm planning to marry.

She's an actress and a good sort,

I think, and we're very fond of each other.

When did you decide?

Some months ago.

You should give a thought to it, too.

No, if the intention wasn't pure,

I don't think

I could go through it.

Purity is like virginity.

As soon as you touch it, it becomes corrupt.

I hope you both will be very happy.

Thank you, Siegfried.

I shall do my best.

What's the matter? TB?

You should have told me.

Why?

There's nothing you can do about it.

I could have taken you somewhere, to a warmer, drier climate.

That rules out Frinton then.

Is there somewhere we can go to help you?

Yes.

I've been there before.

In Germany.

Haus Hirt in Bavaria.

All cow bells, lederhosen and very, very thick thighs.

So idyllic, you'll want to scream.

But the German men...

Gorgeous!

I wonder what the collective noun for them is.

Oh, don't look so glum, Siggy.

I'm not about to join the Hitler Youth.

Yes. Who is it?

 Hello, Siegfried, it's Alexander.

Is Stephen there?

-Hello?

-Don't call here again.

It was Fenton.

I don't like this at all.

We bumped into each other on Piccadilly the other day.

We had a harmless drink and I gave him your number.

Don't do it again!

If that were a request,

I might consider it.

If it's an order, I'll make a point of disobeying it.

What did Glen want?

He's getting married.

The ultimate capitulation.

I'm sure they'll be very happy.

She's probably as mediocre as he is.

You'll be doing it next.

Thought I'd try my hand at some watercolours.

-Hmm.

-Landscapes and things.

It's the Magritte in me.

This is not a pipe.

Rene will be pleased.

How would you describe your style?

Erratic.

But then I'm giving this to a friend whom I really detest.

You don't remember me at all, do you?

The spa?

Ivor Novello? Stephen Tennant?

Oh, yes, of course.

Yes.

The oyster grey silk.

You're supposed to remember me, not the dress.

Before I met you for the first time, I'd always thought you'd be either mercurial or dark.

And what am I, dark or mercurial?

Oh, neither.

You're more opaque, I think.

So what brings you down here?

I... I should like to say the picturesque, but it wouldn't be true.

I came down in the hope of seeing you again.

I used the painting as a ploy.

Oh.

Well, I'm touched.

No one's ever used subterfuge before in order to see me.

It's the modern thing, liberated woman and all that.

It would be very pleasant if you invited me to lunch.

It would be very pleasant if you accepted.

You really are very lovely.

May I kiss you?

You don't have to ask.

I've never had an affair with a woman.

Only men.

Stephen told me all I needed to know.

All my life, I feel as though

I've been waiting for a catastrophe to happen.

Well, that's optimism for you.

My whole future could depend on you.

You must redeem my life for me, Hester.

That sounds like some sort of proposal.

If I was selfish enough,

I'd ask you to marry me.

If I were foolish enough,

I'd accept.

Oh, I look 500 years old.

Some say I am beautiful.

And, as an aesthete,

I feel that beauty is eternal.

We see it in the eyes of those who love us.

Although my mother thinks that my eyes are like cold seawater.

My buttocks and my shoulders are very well-shaped.

But my best feature is the beauty of my hands.

Almond milk and lemon creams are perfect for them, and one must never laugh too much.

It coarsens one's face, especially if the laughter is gleeful.

Stephen, how can you be so narcissistic?

It is my defence against nihilism and the vulgar.

You cannot conduct a life in that way.

Course one can.

My life is my art.

Yours isn't a life, it's barely a hobby.

That was an ugly thing to say.

I know sometimes it's better to be kind than honest, but you are frittering your life away in pomades and powder.

And if you don't believe me, ask someone with more sense and less love.

You've made your antipathy to me very obvious.

I don't need a second opinion.

I'm going to Salisbury for the weekend.

Edith Oliver has found me a cottage to rent in Teffont Magna.

I thought we could spend weekends there.

Will you come?

I, too, have had an invitation.

From whom?

A German prince whom

I think you more than know.

Philip of Hesse, yes.

And one of

Edith Sitwell's proteges.

A concert pianist called Tchelitchew.

Very Cyrillic, very Russian and very divine.

And where are you going to?

Paris first.

Then we'll motor down to

Bavaria so I can recuperate from life.

After Bavaria, they're going to go on to Venice.

Philip told me that he once tried to make love in a gondola, but that there wasn't enough privacy.

Stability.

Oh.

So it was with you, was it?

You sly old thing.

This all seems very sudden.

Yes, it does, doesn't it?

But then, that's my life.

All go.

Older than God, but without any of the influence.

Am I welcome, Hester?

Come in and see.

Siegfried.

Stephen.

How dreadful we all look.

But I still have beautiful hands, I think.

I'll make some tea.

I suppose you've heard of Ivor's death.

Yes.

They say the funeral attracted a thousand people.

Probably made up mostly by all the people he slept with.

I still have a soft spot for Ivor's work, though.

All those tortured princesses and lovers who have no money, but plenty of sex appeal.

His work was always sentimental nonsense.

He cheapened everything he touched.

I've always thought his particular kind of mawkishness was a kind of catharsis for the dimmer members among us.

That's because you have never known the difference between the two.

We can't all possess your purity of thought.

It isn't a question of purity, but of discernment.

And you were never very good at discernment.

That was rather too acerbic.

Mordant would be the more accurate word.

Are you still very angry?

What do you expect?

You ended our relationship with a letter from your doctor.

How was I supposed to feel?

Still clearly very hurt,

I see.

I had hoped that you might have been a little more forgiving.

If I had treated you the way in which you treated me, how forgiving would you be?

Besides, when the parade's gone by, you have to have enough sense to realize that you are no longer a part of it.

I'm trying to apologize.

You're 30 years too late!

Can't we still be friends?

No.

You once meant so much.

Now you mean so little.

-Sieg...

-Don't trivialise it by saying something glib.

Can I see you again?

In London perhaps?

No!

I rarely go to London now.

And how is George?

Young.

Thriving.

He's like all children.

He has the worst aspects of both his parents.

How about his parents' virtues?

He's cursed with those as well.

I am... very lonely, Siggy.

Is it agony?

One does hope so.

George has an independent mind, which sometimes shocks Siegfried.

It isn't independence, it's wilfulness.

Who's died?

All of us.

George, the pipe was not a good idea.

Looks as if it's smoking you.

Old silver tongue.

We could do without the smoke.

Tea, darling?

No, thank you, Mother.

Thank you for the tea.

George will see you out.

- Goodbye.

- Goodbye.

Charming as ever.

But there's still malice at the edge of his voice, as there always was.

Sometimes, Siegfried, it's more humane to be kind than to be honest.

He constantly goaded my jealousy.

It was like being killed by degrees.

He once told me he thought you were matchless.

We are unique only to the people who really loathe us.

 Will you come to dinner tonight at Mother's?

She'd have invited God if she thought He'd come.

I'm uncomfortable with all that distinction.

I'm not at all an intellectual,

I have a very cumbersome mind.

Oh, please come.

Max Beerbohm said he might drop in for a drink.

Hmm.

Then I shall come.

Just to hear Max's delectable gossip.

You know, he, er... he once described

TS Elliot as

"Poor old Tom who sits there ironically

"analysing an empty sardine tin."

Well, you better get your skates on, and I better get my glad rags out of mothballs.

Now don't miss me too much, all right?

Bye!

Goodbye, darlings!

No welcome?

No bunting?

Not even, "You're looking frightfully well, Stephen."

Am I going to get the silent treatment?

Or are we going to conduct the rest of this conversation entirely in Braille?

Beware the wrath of a patient man.

Who said that?

Confucius, I think.

On one of his better days.

Well, if you're going to get all profound on me, perhaps you could throw in

Ol' Man River as a bonus.

How was Bavaria?

Bavarian.

Did your companion stay long?

Long enough.

And what did you do, Stephen?

Apart from cough?

I... Ooh, what's the phrase?

I lived life to the full.

-All three of you?

-Yes.

It's called troilism,

I believe.

-Or an orgy.

-Yes.

That's probably more accurate, but I won't go into detail.

You know how discreet I am in these matters.

My spies tell me you've been seeing a lot of Hester Gatty.

Hester Gatty's been seeing a lot of me.

I'm beginning to see the light.

A new, secretive you.

Surely you're not jealous?

Of course not.

Now we can all be girls together.

Like Roedean.

Have you slept with her?

No.

Our relationship is as deep as it is decorous.

I've even bought myself some passion-killing pyjamas.

Are you going to marry her?

Yes, I think I probably shall.

You'll make a vile partner, Siggy.

Perhaps, but then I have been taught by a master.

You'll be taking a great risk.

I'll be taking the same risk

I took with you.

Couldn't be much worse.

May even be better.

I can see years ahead for both of you.

Filled with passionless silences and compulsory cocoa at bedtime.

Oh, by the way, as we intend to be living in the country,

I'll be giving up the lease on this flat.

I didn't want to leave you in the dark unnecessarily.

But once we've found a house, you'll have to move out.

That sounds almost like a threat.

It almost is.

So you're going to throw baby's little body out into the cold, cold snow?

No, not immediately, no.

We'll wait for warmer weather.

Can I get you anything before I leave?

No.

I'll write once I get to Scotland.

I said I'll write once...

I heard you. I'm trying to listen to the radio.

-Shall I phone?

-No!

What time's your train,

Mother?

Not for an hour.

We've got plenty of time to get to the station.

I'll come back for you later.

 Remember, marry in haste,

repent at leisure.

I was shocked when you got married and for exactly the same reason.

And now it's my turn to be shocked.

I have given you all a bit of a surprise, haven't I?

-Who's officiating?

-Er, Canon Gay.

Ah.

Oh, I'm sorry, Lawrence, have you met Glen Byam Shaw?

Glen this is TE Lawrence.

Of Arabia?

Not recently.

Are you sure you know what you're doing?

I think so.

In the end, we few, we happy few are always exogamous.

Christ, what does that mean?

To marry outside of one's tribe or group.

Do you specialise in using words no one understands?

Yes. It's my revenge on people who don't know what exogamous means.

Have you chosen any music?

No.

Oh, I'm disappointed.

I thought we'd get something

English and dismal.

What are you doing here?

Hester invited me.

I'm her maid of honour.

The vows that you are about to take are to be made in the presence of God, who is the judge of all and knows all the secrets of our hearts.

Therefore, if either of you know any reason why you may not lawfully marry, you must declare it now.

How are you?

Just very tired.

Is there anything

I can get you?

Have you thought of a name?

No.

I thought we might call him George.

Yes.

My whole future depends on him.

You once said that about me.

Do you want to hold him?

...with homes that are rented

So I have invented my own

Darling, this place is a lover's oasis

Where life's weary chase is unknown...

I'm very happy.

And this is the reason.

Cosy to hide in

To live side by side in

Don't let it abide in my dream

Picture me upon your knee

Just tea for two and two for tea

Just me for you and you for me

Alone

Nobody near us to see us or hear us

No friends or relations on weekend vacations

We won't have it known, dear

That we own a telephone, dear

Day will break and I'll awake

And start to bake a sugar cake

For you to take for all the boys to see

We will raise a family

A boy for you, a girl for me

Oh, can't you see

How happy we would be?

How beautifully blue the sky.

The glass is rising very high.

Continue fine I hope it may.

And yet it rained but yesterday.

Tomorrow, it may pour again.

I hear the country needs some rain.

I stood with the dead.

 Come down from Heaven to meet me

when my breath chokes.

And through drumming shafts of stifling death

I stumble towards escape,

to find the door opening on morn

where I may breathe once more

clear cock-crow airs

across some valley dim with whispering trees.

While dawn along the rim of night's horizon

flows in lakes of fire,

come down from

Heaven's bright hill,

my song's desire.

Belov'd and faithful,

teach my soul to wake in glades deep-ranked

with flowers that gleam

and shake and flock your paths with wonder.

In your gaze, show me,

the vanquished vigil of my days.

Mute in that golden silence hung with green,

come down from Heaven and bring me in your eyes

remembrance of all beauty that has been.

And stillness from the pools of Paradise.

 Rising,

rising the voices of the muffled dead.

Are you going to keep this silence up for the rest of the day?

Look, I brought you down to London because I was worried about you!

-I'm fine.

-No, you're not!

There was no food in the house! No heating!

And you were sitting there in the dark like a Protestant bishop!

-I can manage!

-No, you can't!

If you're going to sulk,

I'm going upstairs.

Turn that rubbish off!

I'll do as I like!

It's my house!

-It's my music!

-That isn't music!

It's commercially grotesque noise made by stupid people for stupid people!

Oh, don't be so bigoted!

 The official numbers

of those killed in the First World War.

The United Kingdom and its colonies:

1,225,914.

France: 1,697,798.

Germany: 2,476,897.

Austria-Hungary: 1,567,202.

Russia: 3,311,251...

 These are the statistics of catastrophe.

Yet from Prime to Compline, life goes slowly on.

Are you thinking great thoughts?

No.

Just sitting here being petty.

Trying to understand the enigma of other people.

So many have died.

Too many.

Most people live for the moment.

You live for eternity.

-Don't say that.

-Why not?

Because I'm afraid

I might believe it.

I would have liked to have been recognised, though.

In some significant way for my work.

Eliot got the Order of Merit and the Nobel Prize.

I've had to make do with the Queen's Award for Poetry.

But Sir Siegfried Sassoon, it would have been nice.

-Despite all the sibilants.

-Oh, Father.

How can you be seduced by all that Ruritanian nonsense?

The greatest argument against

Damehoods and Knighthoods is...

Just look at the people who've got them.

Why do you hate the modern world, Father?

Because it's younger than I am.

Well, you've got to bathe and change.

We're going to the theatre, remember?

Do I have to?

Yes, you promised.

Besides, it's a witty and elegant score.

Even you might enjoy it.

I'm sorry I shouted.

It's... So am I.

Peace?

Peace.

I'm a typically English rose

But born of typically

English stock

With a typically Anglo-Saxon family tree

I received my education from a typically English way

In a typically

English girl's academy

I play typically

English tennis

At a typically English club

With my typically

English feelings for fair play

I eat typically

English crumpets

With my typically English tea

At the end of every typically English day

Father is a typically

English colonel

Home is a typically

English county town

Mummy and I play typically English patients

As the typically English rain is pouring down

With a typically

Who likes typically

English walks

Cause there's typically

English trees

Upon the heath

And if anyone asked me

How I like this typically English life

I am fed up to my typically English tea

Shall we take a cab?

No, I'll walk home.

Are you sure?

It's getting very chilly.

I'd rather walk.

 Perhaps my latest effort will please you.

It's called Disabled.

I'll come and get you.

Thank you.

 He sat in a wheeled chair,

waiting for dark

and shivered in his ghastly suit of grey, legless,

sewn short at elbow.

Through the park,

voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn.

Voices of play and pleasure after day.

Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time,

town used to swing so gay

when glow-lamps budded in the light blue trees,

and girls glanced lovelier

as the air grew dim in the old times,

before we threw away his knees.

Now he will never feel again how slim girls' waists are

or how warm their subtle hands.

All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,

for it was younger than his youth, last year.

Now he is old, his back will never brace.

He's lost his colour very far from here.

Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,

and half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race.

And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.

One time he liked a blood-smear down his leg,

after the matches carried shoulder-high.

It was after football when he'd drunk a peg,

he thought he'd better join.

He wonders why.

Someone had said he'd looked a god in kilts.

That's why.

And maybe, too, to please his Meg.

Aye, that was it,

to please the giddy jilts, he'd asked to join.

He didn't have to beg.

Smiling they wrote his lie:

aged 19 years.

Germans he scarcely thought of, all their guilt,

and Austria's, did not move him.

And no fears of fear came yet.

He thought of jewelled hilts

for daggers in plaid socks, of smart salutes,

and care of arms, and leave, and pay arrears, esprit de corps,

and hints for young recruits.

And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer goal.

Only a solemn man who brought him fruits thanked him.

And then inquired about his soul.

Now he will spend a few sick years in institutes

and do what things the rules consider wise,

and take whatever pity they may dole.

Tonight he noticed how women's eyes

passed from him to the strong men who were whole.

How cold and late it is.

Why don't they come and put him into bed?

Why don't they come?

OFFICER:

Get up, get up!

Mixed up in that beating on 12th Street, huh?

No, plain drunkenness.

-Heh.

-It says he was picked up there.

They had him on the carpet down at headquarters.

He's clear. Plain drunkenness.

All right.

-Fill it up.

-No. Can I keep it? Huh?

Okay. You want to lean him against something?

-Stand him over there.

-Come on.

RAY:

Judy?

We're ready for you now.

He must hate me.

RAY:

What?

He hates me.

What makes you think he hates you, Judy?

[WHIMPERING]

I don't think. I know.

He looks at me like...

...I was the ugliest thing in the world.

He doesn't like my friends.

He doesn't like one thing about me.

And he called me....

He called me a dirty tramp!

My own father!

[CRYING]

Do you think he really means that?

Yes!

No!

I don't know.

I mean, maybe he doesn't mean it...

...but he acts like he does.

We were all together.

And we were going to celebrate Easter.

And we were going to catch a double bill.

Big deal!

So I put on my new dress...

...and I came out...

...and he grabbed my face...

...and he started rubbing off all the lipstick.

I thought he'd rub off my lips.

And I ran out of that house.

Is that why you were wandering around at 1 o'clock in the morning?

You weren't looking for company, were you?

I don't even know why I do it.

Maybe you get back at your dad that way.

If you're not as close to him as you'd like to be...

...maybe this is one way of making him pay attention.

Did you think of that?

I'll never get close to anybody.

Would you go home if we can arrange it?

What's your number, Judy?

We'll ask your dad to come and pick you up.

Unless you really don't want to go home.

Would you rather stay here?

You're shivering, John. Are you cold?

It's warm.

Well....

Well, then, there now.

Is that what they call you, or do you have a nickname?

You talk nice to the man now, hear?

He's going to help you.

Nobody can help me.

Can you tell me why you killed those puppies?

No, sir.

Where'd you get the gun?

Where's your mother tonight, Plato?

She's away.

She's got a sister in Chicago, and she's there for the holiday.

Where's your father?

WOMAN:

They're not together, sir.

We haven't seen him now in a long time.

Do you ever hear from him?

It's his birthday today, sir.

Did the boy ever talk to a psychiatrist?

You mean a head shrinker?

Oh, uh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them, sir.

Do you mind if I try? Do you have to slam the door in my face?

[JIM CHUCKLES]

I try to get to him. What happens?

I buy you everything you want.

A bicycle? You get it!

-A car--

-You buy me many things.

FRANK:

Not just buying!

We give you love and affection, don't we?

Then what is it?

Was it because we went to that party?

You know what kind of drunken brawls those kind of parties turn into.

It's no place for kids!

A minute ago, you said you didn't care if he drinks.

He said a "little" drink.

-You're tearing me apart!

-What?

You say one thing, he says another, and everybody changes back again!

That's a fine way to behave!

Well, you know who he takes after.

[SHOUTS]

Inside, Jim.

Come on.

Inside.

-Excuse us a minute.

-Yeah, sure.

Somebody ought to put poison in her Epsom salts.

Grandma?

Get lost.

Hang loose, boy. I'm warning you.

Why don't you wash up and go home?

Oh, this is cute.

RAY:

Big, tough character!

You don't kid me, pal.

How come you're not wearing your boots?

Well, that's cute.

That's cute.

It's too bad you didn't connect.

You could have gone to juvenile hall.

That's what you want, isn't it?

Sure, it is.

You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.

Why?

-Leave me alone.

-No.

I don't know why.

Go on, don't give me that!

Please, lock me up. I'll hit somebody.

I'll do something, and I don't....

[JIM SOBBING]

Try the desk.

[CHUCKLES]

Go ahead.

[GROANING]

Is that why you moved?

You were in trouble?

No, they think...

...that they can protect me by moving around all the time.

You had a good start in the wrong direction. Why'd you do it?

What do you mean?

-Mess a kid up?

-Yeah.

Hmm.

He called me chicken.

Your folks didn't understand?

They never do.

They think that I can make friends...

...if we move.

Just move. Everything will be roses and sunshine.

But you don't think that's the right solution?

JIM:

Oh, she eats him alive and he takes it.

RAY:

Things pretty rough for you at home?

That's a zoo!

What?

That's a zoo!

I mean, he always wants to be my pal, you know?

But how can I give him anything if he's....

Ah, I mean, I love him and all that type of stuff.

I don't want to hurt him.

But then I don't know what to do anymore.

Except maybe die.

If he had guts to knock Mom cold once...

...then maybe she'd be happy and she'd stop picking on him.

Because they make mush out of him!

You know, uh, just mush!

I'll tell you one thing,

I don't ever want to be like him.

Chicken?

I'll bet you see right through me, don't you?

[RAY CHUCKLES]

How can a guy grow up in a circus like that?

Beats me, Jim.

But they do.

Want some water?

Boy, if....

If I had one day...

...when I didn't have to be all confused...

...and I didn't have to feel that I was ashamed of everything....

If I felt that I belonged someplace....

You know? Then....

Jim. Look.

Will you do something for me?

If the pot starts boiling again, will you see me before you get in a jam?

Even if you just want to talk, come in and shoot the breeze.

It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.

-Okay.

-Any time, night or day.

Okay.

You, uh, calmed down enough to go back in there now?

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

-Are you serious?

-Heh.

[DOOR OPENS]

Mother, I'm sorry.

It's all right, darling.

MRS. STARK:

Mister Officer...

...this was all very unfortunate.

He made a mistake, and he's sorry, so we won't have any more trouble.

He was always a lovely boy.

Grandmother, you tell one more lie and you'll turn to stone.

RAY:

Look, Jim...

...don't forget.

Have, uh, some cigars?

No, thanks. I don't smoke.

Give them to your friends.

No, thanks, Mr. Stark.

Frank, he doesn't want any.

[SIREN WAILING]

Jim, your eggs are on the table, dear.

Sit down. Eat. You'll be late.

STELLA:

Beau!

Beau!

Come here, Beau!

Beau, come on!

I don't think I want anything.

I'm nervous.

My first day of school, heh,

Mother made me eat so much...

...I couldn't swallow until recess.

Did you fix me any sandwiches?

There's meatloaf and peanut butter--

[CHUCKLES]

What did I tell you? Peanut butter.

There's a thermos of orange juice...

...and some applesauce cake to go with it.

And I baked it.

-Bye, Mom.

-Goodbye, dear.

Young fellow, you knock them dead like your old man used to, heh.

You know what I think?

I feel maybe we'll stay here awhile.

Listen, watch out about choosing your pals.

Don't let them choose you.

Hi.

Hi. Wait a minute.

Hi.

I've seen you before.

-Well, stop the world.

-You don't have to be unfriendly.

Well, now that's true.

But life is crushing in on me.

Life can be beautiful.

[CHUCKLES]

-I know where it was.

-Where what was?

Where I first saw you.

Everything going okay now?

You live here, don't you?

Who lives?

Hey, where's Dawson High?

At University and Tenth.

Thanks.

You want to carry my books?

I got my car. You want to go with me?

I go with the kids.

[PEOPLE SCREAMING

AND HOOTING]

Yeah.

I'll bet.

[TIRES SCREECHING]

[PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

All right.

You know, I bet you're a real yo-yo.

I love you too.

MAN:

Hey, Stella.

[ALL CHATTERING]

What's that?

-Oh, that's a new disease.

-Friend of yours?

-Glad they let you out.

-Nobody chickened.

-You're lucky he lived.

-They always live.

MAN:

Man, I'm living!

Hey, which way, uh, to University and Tenth?

Uh, which way is it to, uh,

University and Tenth?

-It's that way.

-No, it's that way.

-That way.

-That way.

ALL [CHANTING]:

Thattaway, thattaway, thattaway.

[ALL CHATTERING]

[WHISTLE BLOWS]

MAN:

Hey, watch it!

Where do you think you're going?

You stepped on the school insignia.

Nobody does that, ever!

I'm sorry. It's my first day here...

...and nobody told me about it.

-I'm very sorry.

-It's okay.

-Know where to report?

-No.

Mr. Bassett.

Room 208. He'll show you where to go.

I'm sorry about that.

-Just watch it next time.

-Mm-hm.

MINTON:

--and immensity of our universe.

For many days before the end of our Earth...

...people will look into the night sky and notice a star...

...increasingly bright and increasingly near.

As this star approaches us....

Jim Stark.

I'll go find a place. I'm sorry.

MINTON: As this star approaches us, the weather will change.

The great polar fields of the north and south will rot and divide.

And the seas will turn warmer.

The last of us search the heavens and stand amazed.

For the stars will still be there...

...moving through their ancient rhythms.

The familiar constellations that illuminate our night...

...will seem as they have always seemed:

Eternal, unchanged and little moved...

...by the shortness of time between our planet's birth and demise.

Orion, the hunter.

One of Ptolemy's constellations, and the most brilliant in the heavens.

Boy.

What?

I was just thinking that...

...once you've been up there you know you been some place.

[SNEEZES]

Gesundheit.

MINTON:

They're almost equal in brilliancy.

Cancer, the crab...

...containing a large, loose cluster of stars...

[CHUCKLES]

MINTON:

...called Praesepe or the Beehive.

I'm a crab.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

MINTON:

The sun can be vertically overhead.

Taurus, the bull.

[IMITATING BULL]

Moo, that's real funny.

A comedian, Buzz.

He's cute. I bet he's real rough too.

CRUNCH:

I bet he fights cows.

MINTON:

Sagittarius and Aries....

You shouldn't monkey with him.

-He's a wheel.

-Who?

Buzz.

So is she.

It's hard to make friends with these guys.

I don't want to make friends.

MINTON: While the flash of our beginning has not yet traveled...

...the light years into distance...

...has not yet been seen by planets deep within the other galaxies...

...we will disappear into the blackness of the space from which we came...

...destroyed as we began, in a burst of gas and fire.

The heavens are still and cold once more.

In all the immensity of our universe and the galaxies beyond...

...the Earth will not be missed.

Through the infinite reaches of space...

...the problems of man seem trivial and naive indeed.

And man, existing alone...

...seems himself an episode of little consequence.

That's all.

Thank you for your attention.

Thank you very much.

[MAN COUGHING]

WOMAN: May I have your attention?

May I please have your attention?

Classes will meet at the buses outside.

May I have your attention?

May I have your attention?

Oh, what the heck!

[STUDENTS LAUGHING]

Hey. Hey.

It's all over. The world ended.

What does he know about man alone?

Certainly is a lot of switches.

Yeah, quite intricate.

-Hey, what's for kicks?

-What do you say, Buzz, huh?

Well, what do you want to do?

CRUNCH: How about Moo?

BUZZ: You mean the guy in there?

CRUNCH: The comedian.

MOOSE: What do you say? Huh?

All right! What do you want to do?

MOOSE:

Let's bring him down.

He'd make a good pigeon.

-What's the funny guy doing?

-The guy in back of us, Buzz.

Heh, he ought to have his wardrobe cleaned and burned.

-All right, Moo.

-All right.

-What will we do with him?

-Oh, don't worry.

I'll figure out what we'll do with him.

MOOSE:

Relax. He'll figure it out.

What are you looking at?

Nothing.

JOHN: I told you not to fool with those guys. Now they're laying for you.

If you don't want trouble,

I know where we can go.

It's a big mansion.

There it is.

We could sneak around and they wouldn't know.

JIM: Who lives there?

JOHN: Oh, nobody lives there.

Come on, let's go!

There he is.

That's his car.

Relax, man.

[AIR LEAKING]

[SIGHS]

JIM: You know something?

BUZZ: No, what?

You read too many comic books.

[LAUGHS]

Well, he's real abstract. He's, um, different.

-That's right.

-Heh.

That's right.

I'm cute too.

[ALL MOOING]

[ALL IMITATING CHICKEN]

Is that meaning me?

-Is that meaning me?

-What?

Chicken!

Yes.

You shouldn't call me that.

Hmm.

How about you?

Hmm?

Are you always at ringside?

[GASPS]

What are you hanging around such rank company for?

What?

I don't want any trouble.

The blade game, huh, Buzz?

I thought only punks fought with knives.

Who's fighting?

No fighting. It's examination time, man.

-It's a crazy game, heh.

-Heh.

Get him a knife.

-Jim.

-Hey.

BUZZ:

Give it to him.

Come on, give him a knife.

-Pick it up!

-I don't want any trouble.

Pick it up!

-Now, you understand the action?

-Heh.

There's no sticking.

Crunch?

[SIGHS]

Just, uh...

-...a little jabbing. That's all.

-Heh.

What's the matter?

What're you waiting on, toreador?

I thought you wanted a little action.

-Are you crumb chicken or--

-Don't call me that!

-Ah.

-Whoa, whoa.

Whoa.

Hey.

Hey.

Uh-uh.

Cut off a button and you get to join the club.

Oh, that's close.

Okay. Same place.

Look out, Buzz! He's got a chain!

Dr. Minton. Dr. Minton.

Hey.

All right, you asked for it, you've got it.

-What is it?

-Trouble.

Are you satisfied or do you want some more?

There's your audience.

Oh, I don't think so.

CRUNCH:

Let's split, Buzz.

BUZZ: Split for what?

A couple of old poopheads?

Now, you say the word and you're dead.

You're cold.

I'll meet you someplace, but not with those things.

-That's trouble.

-Oh.

How then? You know the Millertown bluff?

-The bluff?

-Hey, Buzz, that's dangerous up there.

Cookie, get some cars, and we'll have some kicks tonight about 8:00, huh?

-All right.

-We'll have a chickie-run.

Sounds good. Fine.

-You ever been in a chickie-run?

-Yeah.

That's all I ever do.

MAN:

Come on, all of you. Start moving.

Come on, get going.

Oh, you don't mean little old us?

What's the matter with the nice man?

[IMITATES ADOLF HITLER]

We were just cutting out!

Eight o'clock?

Yeah.

[ALL SHOUTING]

Okay.

Plato, what is a chickie-run?

[THUDS]

JIM:

Mom?

Mom?

FRANK:

Hi, Jimbo. You thought I was Mom?

Yeah.

Well, uh, Carol's out.

I was getting Mom some supper.

She doesn't feel too well.

What'd you do, drop it?

-Yeah.

-You dropped it?

[BOTH CHUCKLING]

Shh.

-That's funny.

-I know it.

-I better clean up before she sees it.

-Let her see it.

What?

Let her see it.

What can happen? She's--

Oh.

Dad?

Dad.

Stand. Don't--

I mean, you shouldn't--

What are you--?

[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]

Beau?

Daddy?

-Haven't you forgotten something?

-What?

What's the matter with you?

You're too old for that stuff.

I thought you'd stopped that long ago.

I didn't want to stop.

-Didn't want to stop what?

JUDY'S FATHER: Ah, nothing, nothing.

I was talking to Dad.

-I didn't kiss her, so it's a big thing.

-Oh.

-Bertha, you may serve the soufflé.

BERTHA: Yes, ma'am.

It's fish soufflé.

You don't have to stand, darling.

Sit down and have your tomato juice.

I guess I just don't understand anything.

I'm tired. I'd like to change the subject.

Why?

I'd just like to, that's all!

Girls your age don't do things like that!

You need an explanation?

-Hi, rascal.

-Hi.

Girls don't love their father?

Since when?

Since I got to be 16?

Stop that! Sit down!

[WHIMPERS]

May I please be excused?

Hey. Hey, glamour puss.

I'm sorry. We'll break the date.

We'll stay home.

This isn't my home.

[DOOR CLOSES]

I don't know what to do.

All of a sudden she's a problem.

She'll outgrow it, dear. It's just the age.

The atomic age.

[WHIRRING]

It's just the age when nothing fits.

[DOOR OPENS]

[DOOR CLOSES]

Hey, Jimbo?

Jimbo.

-You awake?

JIM: Dad?

Can I ask you something?

Sure.

Sure, Jimbo.

Shoot.

Suppose you had to do something.

You had to go someplace...

...and do this thing that was...

...you knew it was very dangerous.

But it was a matter of honor.

And you had to prove it.

What would you do?

Well, heh, is there some kind of trick answer?

No, what would you do?

Well, I wouldn't make a hasty decision.

Tell you what, Jimbo.

Let's get a little light on the subject.

Blood.

Jim.

Jim, what happened?

What kind of trouble are you in?

The kind I was telling you about.

Now can you answer me?

Nobody can make a snap decision.

It's one of those things that you....

You can't.

That's all there is to it.

It's something that you.... You just don't.

We've got to consider all the pros and cons.

-I don't have time.

-Unh.

We'll make time.

I'll get paper and we'll make a list.

And then if we're still stuck...

...we'll get some advice.

What can you do when you have to be a man?

Well, uh....

No, you give me a direct answer!

Are you going to keep me from going?

Did I ever stop you from anything?

You're at a wonderful age.

In ten years, you'll look back on this and wish--

Ten years?

I want an answer now. I need one.

Listen, Jimbo, I'm just trying to show you how foolish you are.

Heh, when you're older, you'll look back at this...

...and you'll laugh at yourself...

...for thinking that this is so important.

It's not as if you were alone.

This has happened to every boy.

It happened to me when I was your age, maybe a year older.

Jim.

CAROL:

What's all the excitement?

I've been working trying to get this house in order--

-Jim had blood on him.

-He just ran out.

-Over there, man.

Hi.

-How did you get here?

-I hitched.

[CHUCKLES]

I bet you'd go to a hanging, wouldn't you?

-I guess it's just my morbid personality.

-Yeah.

-Should I leave?

-No, it's okay.

Hmm.

Come on.

Let's go see what we're driving.

No, just him.

It's okay. Stay here.

What did you say your name was?

Yeah, I'm Buzz Gunderson.

I got some goodies for you.

You got a flashlight?

Is he a friend of yours?

Yeah.

Yeah, he's my best friend.

What's he like?

I don't know.

You have to get to know him.

He doesn't say much.

But when he does, you know he means it.

He's sincere.

Well, that's the main thing.

-You want to flip?

-Yeah, go ahead.

Heads.

Maybe next summer, he'll take me hunting with him. And fishing.

I want him to teach me because

I know he won't get mad if I goof.

His name's Jim.

It's really James, but he likes Jim more.

[CHUCKLES]

And people he really likes, he lets them call him Jamie.

-Jamie?

-Heh.

Try the doors.

Hey, try it with the jump.

Oh, yeah.

BUZZ:

That's the edge.

Heh, that's the end.

Yeah.

Certainly is.

You know something?

I like you.

Why do we do this?

You got to do something.

Get all the girls!

Bring it up to the left side.

Go to the end and bring your cars up on the right.

Put your car on the left-hand side.

Turn your lights in toward the center.

Hurry up.

Let's line them up!

Straighten them out.

Tell them when to turn on their lights.

You're okay?

Give me some dirt.

Hey, toreador.

...we head for the edge.

And the first man who jumps is a chicken.

All right?

Want to come home with me?

There's nobody at my house.

Heck, I'm not tired. Are you?

I don't have too many people I can talk to.

Who has?

If you want to come, we could talk...

...then we could have breakfast, like my dad used to.

If only you could've been my dad--

You flipped or something?

Look.

I'll see you in the morning, okay?

I've got to pick up my scooter anyway, you know.

I know.

See you tomorrow.

I wouldn't take a sleeping pill till you were home.

Can I talk to you guys?

I have to talk to somebody. Dad.

Uh....

You better give me an answer this time.

Go ahead.

A direct answer.

I'm in trouble.

You know that big high, uh, bluff near Millertown?

Yes, there was a bad accident there.

They showed the pictures on television.

-I was in it.

-How can you--

It doesn't matter how.

I was driving a stolen car.

Oh, that's a fine thing! Do you enjoy doing this to me, or what?

-You wanted him to make a list!

-Let him tell it!

She doesn't care!

I don't care? You remember how

I almost died giving birth to him?

-And then you say I don't care!

-Please relax, relax!

Tsk.

Dad...

...I said it was a matter of honor.

Remember?

They called me chicken.

You know? Chicken?

I had to go.

If I didn't, I'd never be able to face those kids again.

I got in one of those cars...

...and Buzz, one of those kids, he got in the other car...

...and we had to drive fast...

...and then jump before the car came to the edge.

And I got out okay and Buzz didn't, uh....

And it killed him, ahem.

I can't keep it to myself anymore.

You just get it off your chest.

That is not what I mean!

Dad, uh....

I have never done anything right, um, um....

I've been going around with my head in a sling for years.

I don't want to drag you into this, but I can't help it.

You see, I think...

...you can't just go around proving things and pretending like you're tough.

That's right.

And, uh, even though you got to look a certain way--

-You're absolutely right!

-You look, you feel....

You're not listening to me!

You're involved in this, just like I am!

I'm going to the police and telling them I'm involved.

Did anyone see you?

-Did anyone see your license plate?

-I don't know!

CAROL:

Will the others go to the police?

It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

-Why should you be the only one involved?

-Far be it from me--

Do we have to listen to a sermon now?

I'm telling him what you mean.

You can't be idealistic all your life.

Nobody thanks you for--

-Except to yourself!

-Wait a minute.

Except yourself.

-You don't want me to go?

CAROL: No.

No, I don't want you to go to the police.

There were others.

Why should you be the only one involved?

But I am involved! We are all involved!

Mom.

A boy, a kid was killed tonight!

I can't get out of that by pretending that it didn't happen.

Well, you know that you did the wrong thing.

-That's the main thing, isn't it?

-That's nothing.

That is absolutely nothing.

Dad, you said...

...you want me to tell the truth.

Didn't you say that?

You can't turn it off.

He's not saying that.

He's saying just don't volunteer.

Just tell a little white lie.

You'll learn. When you're older, Jim.

Well, I don't think that I want to learn that way.

It doesn't matter anyway, because we're moving.

You're not tearing me loose again.

-News to me. Why are we moving?

-Do I have to spell it out?

-You won't use me as an excuse again!

-I don't!

Every time you can't face yourself you blame me.

That is not true!

You say it's because of me or the neighborhood!

-No.

-You use every other phony excuse!

Mom, I just....

Once, I want to do something right!

And I don't want you to run away from me again!

-Oh, this is all going too fast.

-You better give me something.

You better give me something fast.

Jimmy, you're very young.

A foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.

-In ten years you won't know it happened.

-Dad, answer her.

Tell her.

Ten years.

Dad, let me hear you answer her.

Dad.

Dad, stand up for me.

Stand up.

You'll kill him.

[GRUNTING]

CAROL:

You're killing him!

Do you want to kill your own father?

[SCREAMING]

-See how they brought us in like that?

-Let go of me!

You want a good crack in the mouth?

Take it easy, Ed. The boy's on edge.

-Come on.

-He shouldn't talk to me that way.

After all, I am his father.

This place appeal to you or something?

-What's he going to pull?

-Nothing, Crunch.

-Did you see any cops with him?

-He was pulled in like the rest of us.

Hey, excuse me.

Can you tell me where I can find, uh, uh....

I forgot his name.

Uh, he works in the juvenile, uh--

Can't you see I'm writing?

He's going to tell, man. I know.

Nobody arrested him.

I think I better go home.

Hey, wait, man.

We'll have some kicks, huh?

-Crunch, my father--

-We'll bring him down, huh?

What do you say?

MOOSE:

You're going to clobber him?

[CHUCKLES]

What, are you out of your mind? Come on.

-What I could write about you--

-I remember his name. Ray.

-What's the charge?

-Assault.

-His name is Ray. I'd like to see him.

-He's not here.

-Huh?

-He's not in Juvenile Hall.

I don't know where he is.

He'll be out all night.

How old are you?

My parents know I'm here.

They know I'm out here.

Come back in the morning, will you?

Well, can I wait?

You ever been booked before?

MAN:

Solid, heh.

[PHONE RINGING]

JUDY'S FATHER:

Hello?

Who wants her?

Who?

Jim who?

I never heard of you.

He didn't have to hang up on him.

Hello, Jamie.

Jamie?

Heh, where'd you get that, ha, ha?

Huh?

How long have you known Plato?

Hm, heh.

About...

MAN [ON RADIO]:

Coming up, another request.

...this morning.

MAN: This time, from the boys at Anna's Pizza Paradise.

A new arrangement of an oldie in rhythm and blues.

Jim, this is dedicated to you...

...from Buzz.

[MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO]

They'll be looking for you.

I didn't chicken. You saw where I jumped.

What do I have to do, kill myself?

It doesn't matter to them.

Well, I guess you're still pretty upset, huh?

I'm just numb.

[CLEARS THROAT]

You know something?

I woke up this morning, you know?

And the sun was shining...

...and it was nice...

...and all that type of stuff.

And the first thing, I saw you.

And I said:

"This will be one terrific day, so you better live it up...

"...because, uh, tomorrow you'll be nothing."

See? And I almost was.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry that I treated you mean today.

You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the rest of the kids.

Nobody acts sincere.

Why did you do that?

I felt like it.

Your lips are soft.

JIM:

Where are you going?

JUDY:

I don't know.

We can't stay here.

I know one thing.

-I'm not going back in that zoo.

-I'm never going back.

Listen, uh....

[SIGHS]

I know a place. Plato told me before.

It's an old, deserted mansion...

...up by the planetarium.

Want to go up there with me?

You can trust me, Judy.

Okay.

-What do you want?

-We want your friend.

Yeah, we got eyes for him. You know it?

-Where does he live?

-You guys better beat it!

Where does he live, huh?

Huh, tell us! Tell us!

-Leave me alone!

-Where does he live?

Get him! Come on!

[DOOR BELL BUZZES]

[GRUNTS]

We want your friend!

GOON:

I got it! I got his address book!

Your friend talked, you know that?

Now you talk!

Talk! Talk!

What are you doing to him?

Here.

Come on, let's get out of here.

-Did you get the book?

-Got it!

[TIRES SCREECH]

WOMAN: Why you want to mix up with bad boys like that?

Why you want to get into trouble all the time?

John.

What you doing with that?

You put that down!

Put it down before you hurt yourself!

I have to warn him!

John.

You stay home, John!

Bill Sibley.

Sam Stuart.

Stark. Jim Stark. Here it is.

1753 Angelo. Well, well.

[HAMMER BANGING]

Frank.

Frank, I'm frightened!

-What's that pounding?

-I don't know.

At first I thought it was Jim....

He's not home yet.

He's home, dear. I heard his car.

-Well, are you going down there?

-Look, will you please relax?

Now, you see?

It stopped.

I still think you ought to go down there.

Who's there?

Anybody there?

Open it.

[HEN CLUCKS]

Who's out there?

MAN 1: Where's your son?

MAN 2: Where's your baby boy gone to?

MAN 1: We want to talk to him.

FRANK: He's not here.

Look in his room. Jim.

Jim.

Son?

Frank. Is he there?

No, honey, he's not here.

[SCOOTER APPROACHING]

-What are you doing?

-Do you know where Jim is?

No, I don't know.

Do you know where he is?

I think....

I'm sorry I bothered you.

Hey, come back here!

Who are you?

[GLASS SHATTERS]

JUDY:

Careful, Jim.

-Those noisy neighbors.

-Heh.

[THUDS]

Come on!

Jim?

Jim, it's me.

[JIM GROWLS THEN LAUGHS]

They're looking for you.

Everybody.

Crunch and Goon and everybody!

We know.

They think you told the police on them.

They're going to....

[THUDS]

Who's in there?

Nobody. Just us chickens.

[JIM & JUDY LAUGHING]

-Who's in there?

-Judy. Judy's up there.

-Let me in?

-Yeah. All right.

But your house is a mess.

Heh, watch out.

[BOTH LAUGHING]

-Where'd he go?

-I don't know.

Huh?

[CHUCKLES]

Well, we're safe here.

I hope.

Well?

What do you think of my castle?

-Wow.

-Shoo.

Wow.

Well, now, there, then, uh....

I think we'll take it for the summer.

Right this way.

Oh, uh, uh....

Would you like to rent it?

Or are you more in the mood to buy, dear?

-You decide, darling.

-Oh, yes.

-Uh, remember our budget.

-Oh, don't give it a thought.

-It's, uh, only 3 million dollars a month.

-What?

Oh, we can manage that.

I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone.

You see, we're newlyweds.

-Oh, there's just one thing.

-Heh.

What about...?

Children?

Right this way.

Yes.

We really don't encourage them.

They're so noisy and troublesome.

Don't you agree?

Oh, yes, yes.

And so annoying when they cry.

Oh, I don't know what to do when they cry.

Do you, dear?

Eh, drown them like puppies, eh.

The nursery's far away from the rest of the house.

Forgot to wind your sundial.

And if you have children, you'll find this is a wonderful arrangement.

They can carry on and you'll never notice.

Oh, a sunken nursery.

In fact, if you lock them in, you'll never have to see them again.

-Much less, talk to them.

-Talk to them?

-Nobody talks to children.

-No, they just tell them.

What time is it?

Hang loose. We've got all night.

I wonder if the maid could tell who we were if she saw us again.

Sure she could.

I know she could.

You still want to go home, Moose?

No.

Then shut your mouth...

...before your guts run out.

[SCREAMS]

Quick, fill the pool!

[GROANS]

[ALL LAUGHING]

Let's see how long we can stay under.

Um....

You can't talk underwater.

[JUDY LAUGHING]

Ooh....

[ALL LAUGHING]

I never saw you having so much fun.

I came here a lot of times before, but I never had fun.

Why not?

Because I was alone.

All right.

[CHUCKLING]

What'd you come back here for?

Because I'd run away.

I used to run away a lot...

...but they always took me back.

Who?

Mom and Dad.

Now that I don't have them I wish...

...I never had run away.

I used to lie in my crib at night...

...and I'd listen to them fight.

Can you remember back that far?

I can't even remember what happened yesterday.

Heh, I can't.

How do you do it?

I had to go to a head shrinker.

He made me remember.

Did he?

Then my mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead, heh.

Well, what's your problem?

Oh, I don't know...

...but I'm happy now.

Here.

Oh, I wish we could stay here.

Plato, where's your father now?

He's dead.

He was a hero in the China Sea.

[JIM LAUGHING]

You told me he was a big wheel in New York.

I did?

What's the difference?

He might as well be dead anyway.

It's all right.

PLATO: Hmm.

JUDY: Mm-hm.

Sure. Sure.

[JUDY HUMMING]

I wonder how many rooms in this place?

I don't know. A lot, probably.

Probably.

Do you want to explore?

Mm-hm.

[JIM & JUDY CHUCKLE]

Must have been a nervous day.

He must have started out nervous.

-I've done that, though. Haven't you?

-Uh-huh.

That looks like our boy's car, huh?

Oh, tsk, well, what do you know?

Hi.

Is this what it's like to love somebody?

I don't know.

What kind of a person do you think a girl wants?

-A man.

-Yes.

But a man who can be gentle and sweet.

Like you are.

Ooh, heh.

And someone who doesn't run away when you want them.

Like being Plato's friend when nobody else liked him.

That's being strong.

Oh, well.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

Oh, heh....

We're not going to be lonely anymore.

Ever, ever.

Not you or me.

I love somebody.

All the time I've been...

...looking for someone to love me.

And now I love somebody.

And it's so easy.

Why is it easy now?

I don't know.

It is for me too.

I love you, Jim.

I really mean it.

Well, I'm glad.

Good morning.

Let's take him!

That's it.

This is unit 17.

We just zeroed gray Ford coupe, 1946.

Observatory Drive and Crest Place.

Looks like housebreaking.

Alert Juvenile and stand by to send help.

[PLATO CRYING]

PLATO:

Save me!

Save me!

Save me.

Plato, what's with...?

PLATO: Why did you run out on me?

Why did you leave me alone?

JIM:

What's the matter with you?

-What's the matter with you?

PLATO: I thought you were someone else.

Who? Plato, it's me! Look at me.

-What's the matter?

-Let me go! You're not my father!

You're not my father!

Halt!

Come here, son.

Come here.

Walk over here quietly, and there won't be any trouble.

Cover the house. I'll head him off.

Halt!

Jim.

-Did he hit you?

-I'm all right.

-We have to go back.

-I'm going after him.

-After he tried to shoot you?

-Stay down.

He didn't mean it.

We shouldn't have left him.

-He needs us.

-He needed you maybe, but so do I.

He needs you too.

You okay?

Come on.

You should have heard him earlier tonight.

He was talking about you...

...like you were the hero in the China Sea.

-You know what he wanted?

-What?

He tried to make us his family.

I guess he just wanted us to be like...

...his....

Halt!

Jim, they're killing him!

Come out of there!

You're making it tough on yourself, kid.

Come out quietly now.

You didn't kill anybody yet.

[GUNSHOT]

[POLICE SIREN WAILS]

Need a little help here.

We heard firing. He hit anybody?

-Are you alone?

-Yeah.

We got a kook inside with a gun.

He wounded some kid.

-How'd he get in?

-Smashed the front door.

-Is there another entrance?

-Down in back.

Seal him off.

CAROL:

I don't understand. I don't understand.

You pray for your children.

You read about things like this happening to other families...

...but never dream it could happen to yours.

RAY:

The observatory?

Five housebreaking in area.

Right. We'll proceed. Over.

There are some other kids in trouble.

You'll have to go with me.

Sure, sure. That's all right.

Lieutenant says seal them off.

[POLICE SIREN WAILING]

-Hello, Ray.

-Hi.

You know anything about this?

No more than you do.

There's a kid in there with a gun.

He wounded another kid and shot at an officer.

-You got a speaker?

-Yeah, help yourself.

-What's going on?

-Some kid's in trouble. Stay back.

I got to know. My boy ran off and he got a gun, too.

All right. Lieutenant!

RAY [OVER SPEAKER]:

I'm addressing the boy in the planetarium.

I'm speaking to the boy inside.

This is Ray Frameck from the Juvenile Division.

Armed police are outside.

Whoever you are, drop your weapon and come out.

Come outside!

Clasp your hands over your head and come outside quietly.

Mr. Stark!

Frank!

-That's my son.

RAY: Hm.

Hold your fire!

MAN:

Are you sure?

I think I know my son.

RAY [OVER SPEAKER]: Officers, another boy and girl just ran into the planetarium.

We don't know if they're armed.

Hold your positions until further instructions.

Another boy and girl just ran into the planetarium.

We don't know if they're armed.

Hold your positions until further instructions.

You in there?

You're my friend, Plato.

That means a lot to me.

Hey! I'm going to open the door now.

You can shoot me if you want to.

Okay.

Ooh, boy, I'm blind as a bat, heh.

You got a match?

Gonna break my neck in here.

Where are you?

PLATO:

I've got a gun.

Yeah, I know.

-Light a match, will you?

-No.

How are you?

I'm fine.

That's fine.

Jim?

Do you think the end of the world will come at nighttime?

Uh-uh.

At dawn.

Come on, now, heh.

Where are you?

What are you hiding for?

Just stand up.

How can I talk to you if I can't see you?

Huh, huh?

I can't talk to you if I can't see you.

Come on, stand up.

You've seen this show before.

Heh, come on.

Do you see that star up there?

Plato? Stand up. Look at it.

I can't talk to you if I can't see you.

That's all there is to it.

I'm not going to hurt you or anything like that.

Why did you run out on me?

We didn't run out on you.

We were coming right back, I told you.

You sure?

Sure, I'm sure.

Judy's here.

She's waiting. Come on.

Come on.

No? Not ready to come out yet?

-No.

-No?

Okay.

Promise you, nothing will happen if you do.

No.

Are you cold?

Here.

It's warm. Here.

My jacket. It's warm.

Can I keep it?

Well, what do you think, heh?

Hey, now can I have the gun, Plato?

You want to give it to me?

-My gun?

-Yeah. In your pocket.

Give it to me.

No.

No, I need it.

[SIGHS]

Don't you trust me, Plato?

Just give it to me for a second.

Uh....

Been carrying this around all day?

Huh.

Heh.

Uh....

Now there's a...

...lot of people out front.

-Plato. Plato?

-You promised to give it back.

Friends always keep their promises.

Well, uh....

These people, um....

You know, every one of them want to see that you're safe.

You understand that?

They want you to be safe.

And.... Oh, here.

They said I could come in here...

...and I could bring you out, and--

Why?

Because they like you.

Okay?

-Come on.

-Yeah.

-Hi, Plato.

-Hi.

It's too bright.

Yeah.

Okay.

I'll fix it, hm.

Is Ray Frameck still out there?

RAY [OVER SPEAKER]:

Yes, I'm here.

Hey, turn out those lights!

If you do, we'll come out!

RAY [OVER SPEAKER]:

Okay. Turn your lights out.

See? Come on.

[JIM CHUCKLES]

Who's that?

JIM: Just a guy.

PLATO: I shot at one of them.

JIM:

It's all right. You didn't hurt him.

Those are not my friends!

Make them go away.

You want me to make them go away?

You want me to fix it? Okay.

Jim.

Ray, can you make those guys get back?

You don't have to worry about anything. Here.

Keep the guys back. Ray?

That other kid still has a gun.

No.

Don't turn on the lights! It's too bright.

Plato doesn't.... Turn out the lights!

JUDY:

Jim.

Jim.

[GUNSHOT]

John!

I got the bullets!

Look!

Let him alone!

Who are you? What do you want?

All right, fellas. All right, Lieutenant.

Get the stretcher in here.

For a minute there, I--

When I saw that red jacket, I....

I thought....

Hey, jerkpot...

...what'd you do that for?

You can't help it, son.

You did everything a man could.

[JIM CRYING]

Help me.

You can depend on me.

Trust me.

Whatever comes, we'll face it together.

I swear it.

Now, Jim...

...stand up.

I'll stand up with you.

I'll try and be as strong as you want me to be. Come on.

This poor baby got nobody. Just nobody.

He was always cold.

Mom.

Dad.

This is Judy.

She's my friend.

He's....

# Bones and all

Come on. Pass, pass. I'm open.

A little slower in the hallway, please.

- You're an idiot.

- What if no one asks me?

Like last year?

I'll get that, milady.

You didn't tell me you played piano.

Hey.

You are here.

Where have you been?

You weren't in home ec. All week.

I got a slip to work on the yearbook.

We missed our deadline with jostens.

Ah. How's it look?

You're not gonna be in it, by the way.

Mr. Esser said he reminded you three times to get your picture taken.

Hey, so my dad's doing inventory all night, and Kim and Jackie are sleeping over.

Come too.

No, my dad won't let me.

So sneak out. After he goes to bed.

How would I get there?

You're down in southwind, right?

You know the power lines that go up the hill?

That's chesapeake road at the top.

I'm right there.

You said you wanna make more friends here.

Hey. Come on, you drive.

- Okay.

- Take care. Bye.

See you, Anne.

Hey. That was good on the road.

Gotta work on that parking some more...

Butgood.

You think it's gonna rain tonight?

Don't think it's supposed to.

Got homework?

Just reading, dad.

The man has attempted suicide.

I think he realized...

That this scheme that he had been involved in about which he had always been extremely guilty.

I mean, he's, I think, the only person in this entire scheme to have voluntarily walked out on it.

Some people were annoyed with it, upset with it but went along with it.

Others enjoyed it because they were making a lot of money out of it.

Dowd was the only person who had the character...

'Night, dad.

And the moral fiber...

- Yeah. Sleep good.

- To walk out on this scheme long before anybody knew about it...

Because it disgusted him.

I mean, the prospect of actually walking into Donald manes' office...

And paying him cash,

Dowd, I think he carried that guilt with him.

Oh, she's here.

Hang on. Okay.

- Hey.

- Hey.

You got prickers all over you. Come in.

They said it was this song for the homecoming dance, but...

So you can't spend the night?

Not all night.

I should be back by 6:00 to be safe.

Jesus.

I'll just head out when you guys wanna sleep.

So where'd you move here from anyway?

Eastern shore.

Is your mom in the picture?

Sherry says you only have a dad.

Cinnamon glaze.

We're trying to talk.

Kim, give me your hand.

Never mind about your mom.

It's none of my business, anyway.

I don't have any memories of her.

Or photos even.

My dad wouldn't tell me anything.

Try that. It's called copper fever.

It's too orange.

Oh, my god!

Maren, stop it!

Stop! Stop it!

Maren, stop! Maren, no!

Jackie!

Maren, stop!

Jackie! Jackie, help!

Jackie, help!

[{Panflng]

You... you didn't.

In the car in three minutes.

Whatever you can take in three minutes.

Shit.

Move, maren!

When the cops get here, we have to be good and gone.

Dad?

I've got some things to say.

And then I want you to make sure this, uh, tape is good and destroyed.

Don't keep it.

This has got my voice on it.

You're not going to see me again, maren.

I can't...

Help you anymore.

I can't do anything else, either.

Call the cops or whatever somebody might do in my place.

So I gotta leave you to figure it out for yourself.

Like your mother did.

I'm sorry. You know what I mean now.

I don't know how much of what I'm gonna say you'll remember.

Yeah. Never was sure.

But just in case,

I 7! Tell you everything I know.

First time was when you were three.

Downey has the crowd screaming at towson state university.

The topic was the most controversial issue on this year's Maryland ballot, the gun ban referendum.

The majority of those in the audience seem to be against the ban...

But we found those on both sides of the issue.

I just don't think it's fair for all the innocent people that wanna get a gun...

I don't want them comin' in my living room and telling me what I can and can't buy.

Y'all think if you take the guns away from everybody...

You have less shooting with the whole nine-yards, the criminals and the innocent people.

Uh...

I need to get here.

- Mmm.

- What's the closest I can get by bus?

Well, looks like Detroit lakes.

Three transfers.

Frederick, Maryland,

Columbus and Minneapolis.

One way? $83.

How much to Columbus?

Shouldn't you be in school?

You'd think.

I don't know what that means.

Means I'm 18, in the state of Maryland, and I can decide for myself where I should be.

I'm gonna need to see a driver's license or a learner's permit.

You can see a birth certificate.

Come on.

Just to Columbus?

It's $49.

$50.

I had a sitter for you then.

Her name was penny.

When I came in, she was on the bathroom floor.

There was... so much blood.

Her face was chewed up bad, but the worst of it was her neck.

She must've been holding you when you started in on her.

Her hands, all chewed up.

I thought you were dead too.

That somebody had done you both, but you were sleepin'.

When I turned you over,

I saw the blood on your mouth.

You had something in your cheek.

I fished it out.

It was soft, like a wad of gum.

It had a little hole in it where an earring would go.

I remember thanking god she hadn't been wearing any, you could've choked.

I got the body out,

I bleached the place three times and then packed us up and left.

They never found where I put her.

That was the last time

I used our real last name.

Now you know why.

Nothin' happened for a few years.

I relaxed.

You had to start school and I thought you wouldn't do it in public and you didn't.

But you got clever.

So fucking clever.

I didn't mean to scare you.

You waiting for the bus?

Well, no, missy.

I came lookin' for you.

Do I know you?

I guess not in the way you mean.

I smelled you.

You probably smell me now.

When was the last time you fed?

Stop, stop, stop there. Stop.

You haven't in a long time.

I'll say...

Many months.

At least.

You can smell that?

Oh, sure.

You can...

You can smell lots of things if you know how.

And we just smell anyway.

Whether we ate or not.

Hmm.

Come on, missy.

Come on.

Come on.

Where are we goin'?

Just here, some place dry and safe.

I'm Sullivan.

Friends call me Sully.

Maren.

Is this your house?

Listen, maren, don't worry. I'm okay.

I got rules.

One... number one is never, never, ever eat an eater.

Think you can follow that too?

All right.

I'll fix some dinner for us.

I smelled you from the yard, little missy.

Come on.

This far?

Round the back.

We'll talk inside.

The Sully, he found these little cornish hens...

In the freezer.

These hens...

They look like they had a good life.

Thought I was the only one.

Are there lots of us?

Not lots.

But more... than you'd think.

You've met a few, sure, that you know of.

You never had anyone take a interest in you?

A double take?

Just always thought...

You just thought some people are creepy.

It's better if we all steer clear of one another.

We're dangerous to non-eaters, but we can hurt one anotherjust as bad.

I hope you're hearing me on this.

You sound like my dad.

Your daddy find out about you?

What about you?

You basicallyjust said steer clear of people like us.

But you came looking for me.

Smart.

When I saw you're just a girl on your own...

I thought...

You might be hungry.

Forhens?

Who lives here?

Well, go and look.

Use your nose.

What do you smell?

Is there someone dead up there?

What do you smell?

Describe it.

Metallic.

Like blood?

No, like mud.

Something tangy.

But not like rotten.

But close.

More like vinegar.

Like vinegar in the soup.

Yeah. Yeah.

- She's alive.

- Missy.

- We'll get help.

- Missy.

- What did you do to her?

- I found her like that this mornin'.

You're lying. Let me by.

Listen. Let me bone down on this.

Whatever you and I got, it's gotta be fed.

No. Um...

No, 'cause it was...

It was years before my last time.

That's because you're young.

You're gonna need it more and more, and more and more.

And you won't always be able to hold yourself back.

But if the circumstances is safe and good then eat.

It'll last a while.

Maybe it'll keep you from, you know, doing something you'll regret...

Even more.

Even more, missy.

Yes, Sully found her that way.

I followed my nose.

I don't... I don't kill people.

At least I try not to.

That leaves this.

And things like it.

Can I have a few minutes, please?

Sure, you can.

I don't think it'll be a long time now.

When the time comes, you'll smell it.

This is how I do it.

It helps me to remember each one.

When I began this, I was about your age.

Pull it.

You won't break it.

It's strong.

Who was your first?

You remember?

I ate my own grandad...

While they were waiting on the undertaker.

Did anyone find you while you were doing it?

My mama.

My mama found me aftennards.

Cleaned me up.

She told everyone animals got in and did it.

But when I finally ran off, no one came looking for me.

And you've been on your own since then?

It's not hard...

Once someone teaches you.

But you don't... you don't, uh...

You don't need to be alone.

You can burn with me as long as you like.

I'm looking for someone.

Your mama.

You mentioned your daddy last night so I knew he was in the picture.

You must be runnin' from him or he left you or somethin'.

But you didn't say nothin' about your mama, though.

I never met her.

All I have is the name of the town she was born in.

It's on my birth certificate.

Mmm-hmm.

We better clean up before we dry stuck to these chairs.

Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes

Beautiful, beautiful brown

Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes

The next few, I didn't see.

A boy went missin' at a camp you went to.

I shouldn't have let you go.

But you wanted to.

It was just a week. You were eight.

When that boy went missin', I knew this is who you are.

I never thought what you are.

I don't know if I loved you the way a father should, but I didn't hate you.

You...

You ate them.

I believed you had to. I don't know why.

They found his pup tent pitched in the heavy woods, all bloody inside.

Luke somethin' Vanderbilt.

Good evening, everyone.

They ruled it a homicide,

I never heard.

This is the end of the line.

Vanden/vall or somethin' like that.

Take all your belongings with you.

I watched after to see if you looked sad, and you didn't.

That was the beginnin' of sayin' no to things.

Now you know why for that, too.

So I was thinking...

No. It's not there.

Carl.

You don't have lunchables?

What kind of goddamned grocery store runs out of lunchables?

Excuse me.

Whoa, you trying to run me down?

I asked a question.

- Hear this, you dumb ho.

- Hey, don't talk to her like that!

You're out of control, buddy.

You with the store or somethin'?

No, I'm not with the store, but I'm gonna escort you out of it.

- Fucking see what happens.

- See what happens?

- Yeah.

- What's gonna happen?

- Something bad's gonna happen.

- Yeah.

Outside. We're going outside.

You enjoy hassling people, man?

Is that what you do on Saturdays when you're done jerking off?

Hey, gimme my hat, you little jackass.

He's over in there, like, 400 yards if you wanna...

You could tell, in the store?

I smelled you too.

I didn't know I could do that.

I'm, uh, going to Minnesota.

I got dumped here by a ride.

I just stole dinner.

It was all I could think to do.

You're not local either, I guess.

Why does that matter?

That was nice what you did for that mom in there.

I'm 18, if you're wondering.

I was gonna guess younger.

Thanks.

I don't usually talk to anyone after.

I don't actually meet many others.

Sort of glad not to.

Yeah, I get it.

I'm just saying I'm not an asshole.

You should probably go anyway.

Up close, you can see blood.

We're fine.

I really don't think I am.

You wanna get in for a minute?

This truck's his.

You can't just take it.

Everyone's got their rules.

That's not one of my rules.

"Barry cook.

5278 route 13. Centerville, Indiana."

You're going to his house?

Yeah, he didn't have any pictures in his wallet.

- I think it'll be all right.

- Took his wallet, too?

I didn't take his wallet,

I took the money out of the wallet.

Eight bucks.

I chucked the wallet in a creek back there.

I'm maren.

I'm Lee.

I don't know whether to cry or scream, or laugh, or what.

Don't scream.

I thought I was the only one.

Now I meet two others in a week.

Hey, do you think you could help me?

I'm new at this.

No one our age is new at this.

Well, I'm new at remembering it.

At all.

Look,

I won't try to mess with you. I promise.

I don't wanna hurt anybody.

Famous last words.

He's got lick it up by kiss.

That's the one where they stop wearing make-up.

Who?

You don't know lick it up?

You don't know kiss?

You were home-schooled, I guess.

Smells like he'd been getting stoned in here for 30 years.

Wait, this is it. He has it! Lick it up.

Fuck.

Yeah, yeah you know?

Don't wanna wait till you know me better let's just be glad for the time together life's such a treat and it's time you taste it there ain't a reason on earth to waste it it ain't a crime to be good to yourself lick it up lick it up oh, oh-oh!

Ooh, yeah lick it up lick it up oh, oh-oh!

Don't need to wait for an invitation

Here comes Robert Ford there, interfering where he's got no place.

- Disqualification on Eric.

- Yeah.

Fuller jumps up in the ring.

Robs jarrett.

Keith Eric starts to kick on him...

And Fuller says no, ham, and he throws...

It's your birthday.

I've been waiting on this day for a long time.

You seemed like such a hardcase yesterday.

When you weigh 140 pounds wet, you gotta have a big attitude instead.

I've got that for you.

- And the pancakes.

- Thanks.

- And your bacon.

- Thank you.

Sully.

That's his name. The other guy I met.

He showed up at a bus station saying he could smell me half a mile away.

- Can you do that?

- Not that far.

Said he could also smell when people are about to die too.

Actually, I think I might have heard of this guy.

- Really?

- Yeah.

Keeps this braid woven with the hair.

People that he eats.

- Christ.

- It's like eight feet long.

That's a choice.

We don't have to be like that.

Why didn't you tag along with him?

Something about him. I don't know.

I think he was tryin' to help.

I profoundly doubt that.

He was creepy, I guess.

Did that dawn on you before or after you ate Mrs. Herman together?

More coffee?

- Yes, please.

- Okay.

Can I get anything else for you guys?

- That's all right. That's good, thanks.

- You're welcome.

- Harmon. Mrs. Harmon.

- Mrs... Mrs. Harmon.

Okay. You're welcome.

Does that help?

Memorizing their names?

Why'd you offer to bring me along?

You seem nice.

I am nice.

Mmm.

Do I seem nice?

I'm going to the bathroom.

How do you feel about sleeping outside?

Okay.

It'll be cold tonight, but if we keep this truck we'll get a sheet of plywood for back here.

What's in Kentucky anyway?

It's my little sister.

I promised to give her driving lessons before she has to take her test.

- Mmm.

- She's a good kid.

Do you get home often?

A little bit.

I left when I was 17.

How come?

I didn't finish school, which sucks.

I'm guessing you didn't, either.

Other ways to learn, I guess.

Maybe what other peoples' weaknesses may be.

That Satan knows where your weakness is.

I said he knows where your weakness is.

He knows how to stir you up.

I said he knows how to stir you up.

And he knows

That one of my weaknesses that I will confess to is the ability to hate you to the bitter end.

We'll stay here tonight.

This is my aunt's place.

She died in march.

My house's on the other side of that plant.

I can't be seen in town, though.

You need to know why?

What's gonna happen to all this stuff?

My mom's cleanin' it out.

She's a teacher, though. She got school.

No, keep that off.

And keep the windows closed tonight too.

Okay, I'MMA take Kayla drivin' behind the mall.

Hope I don't die.

I'll bring back some food for us later.

Kayla's your sister?

Yeah. Kay...

Kayla. I call her "idiot" to her face.

Or "stupid." Or whatever.

You can snoop around if you want, I won't be offended.

See you later.

Lock the door.

Lee, open up the goddam door, asshole. I know you're in there.

Man, open up this door, Lee. Let's go.

Why are you banging on the fucking door?

What the fuck are you doing here?

Nice work, you motard.

- Found this note you put in my purse.

- Ow!

You're leaving? Already?

Maren, this is Kayla.

Kayla, this is maren.

You're a fuckin' asshole.

- Why are you talking like that?

- You said that you were gonna

- stick around this time.

- Chill, Kayla.

Something came up.

I gotta... I gotta head out of town.

I... don't believe you anymore, Lee.

Where are you always going anyway?

Let's go outside, come on.

I wanna talk to you outside.

I'm going away for a little bit...

All right? That's it.

Is that your girlfriend?

That's my friend friend, all right?

Maybe you can meet her some other time.

Look, I can't stay, Kayla.

I just wanted to take you drivin' like I said I would.

I fuckin' hate that you do this.

You know, dad did this, and then he didn't come back.

Don't you know every time you drive off, we're terrified?

I'll be back in a couple of weeks.

What difference does it make?

- You're not listenin' to me.

- Yes, I am.

Two weeks tops.

I'm not dad. I wouldn't do that.

Is there anything that you don't lie about?

And you look like a fucking faggot in that shirt.

Honestly, fuck you, Lee. Fuck you.

God, fuck it, man.

Let's go tonight.

She's probably gonna tell my mom that we're here.

If she comes, I...

I wanna spare you that.

I worked summers here.

I can't get in the safe, but they keep all the petty cash in a drawer in the cafe.

A cafe at a slaughterhouse?

Aren't there guards?

Yeah. Dale.

Deaf in both ears.

You be the bank.

I wanna show you something.

The music's supposed to keep 'em calm.

You ever think about that...

Every one of them has a mom and a dad...

Sisters, brothers, cousins, kids.

Friends even?

A language.

Listen to them.

You never told me what was in Minnesota.

My mom.

She lives there?

I don't know.

I don't even know if she's still alive...

All I have is the name of the town that she was born in.

Could take a while to track her down, you know.

It might even be a dead end.

It's all I have.

Then that's where we'll start.

I can take you...

If you want. It's a lot of driving, but I'm up for it, if you are.

We could take our time. See the country.

Well, Missouri and Iowa anyway.

Never been to either.

Amarillo by mornin'

Up from San antone everything that I got ls just what I've got on whoo-hoo!

What was your first time like?

It was a babysitter.

- Mine too.

- Really?

What was it like?

A rush.

I could feel every blood vessel like spider-webbing through me.

Felt like some kind of weird new superhero.

What about aftennard?

What'd you feel about it?

What'd you think?

I don't remember after.

That's bullshit.

Hey, I'm not just gonna tell you what you wanna hear.

You asked me a question,

I gotta answer it.

Would you do something with me?

- Listen to something with me?

- Yeah.

Whoo!

I told you they'd be back here.

- Hey.

- Hey.

I saw you guys down at the swimming hole before.

Oh, yeah, we saw some people down there too.

You were up there on those rocks.

Up, uh...

Upwind of us.

You get me?

Don't worry, we're friendly.

I'm Jake. That's, uh, Bradley.

Goddamn, my name is Brad, man.

Call me what I want.

Nice to meet you, Brad.

Nice to meet you, Jake.

I'm Leon. That's Maggie.

You just passing through?

Yeah, just passing through.

Is that a problem?

We're not here to run you out.

We thought you might be in need of some beer.

We got you.

Not many come through here.

What do you say?

I'm into this now, right?

Pulling meat, bones comin' out, you know.

And I start feeling watched.

I look around and at first,

I don't see him 'cause he's...

He's standing so still in the trees, but then I spot him.

I'm like, "what the fuck?"

I mean, I look like the red devil at this point.

He's just watching me, like I'm...

Doug fuckin' henning.

I'm already on my feet, and I'm runnin' at him, and he pulls a fuckin' pistol on me.

Turns out he's an off-duty cop.

First year on the force.

We did say we weren't gonna tell nobody about that.

Oh, right, right.

So, he's a cop.

I think he's gonna take me down, but he's just...

He's just looking at me.

And what did I say?

He said, "do me now or get the fuck gone

'cause he ain't gonna be no fun to eat cold."

I love it.

So he says...

"Go on, back to it.

Hmm. I gotta get a better look at this."

So, uh...

I... I suddenly feel him right there crouched down, gettin' a better look.

He doesn't smell like an eater.

But there he is.

So I ask if he wants some.

And damned if he don't nod all serious, like a food-stamp kid on samples day.

- Yeah.

- So you know what I gave him?

You're not one of us?

Abso-fucking-lutely normal he is!

Well, uh, clearly not normal.

Hasn't had his full bones yet.

But I reckon that's coming soon enough.

"Full bones"?

When you eat the whole thing.

Bones and all.

You ain't done that yet?

That's a big fucking deal.

It's like your first time.

There's before bones and all, and then there's after.

That's bullshit.

It's impossible, what you're talking about.

How many people have you eaten?

I count three.

Yes, miss.

Three people.

And you didn't have to?

You... don't have to do this?

Kind of a groupie, I guess.

Jesus Christ.

You okay?

Jake's teaching me how to smell other eaters.

No, he's not.

You don't think he can do it?

Is she all right?

Whoa, fuck. Fuck.

She's lucky she's got you to help.

God.

Her isn't the one who needs the help, Brad.

You can see it a mile away.

You remind me of everyjunkie I ever met.

You look like the kind that's convinced himself he's got this under his thumb.

But you pull on one little thread and...

But maybe love will set you free, man.

Maybe love will set you...

Free.

Lee, Lee.

What?

- What?

- Look.

Go, go, go.

Walk in silence don't walk away -

In silence

See the danger, always danger

Hot dogs!

Endless talking, life rebuilding

Roll up. Roll up.

Don't walk away

I'm hungry, Lee.

- We should do that right over there.

- Yeah, we have four tickets.

- Okay.

- Yes.

Step right up.

We've got big prizes.

Three tickets, three tries.

Three tickets, three tries.

- Who wants to play?

- Anybody a good shot over here?

Three tickets, three tries.

Can I play?

You're wasting your money.

Come on.

- Ah!

- I won. Iwon.

No, you didn't, little man.

But... but it's in a can.

What does that mean?

What you just did. No underhand.

But that other kid did it.

You can read, can't you?

Now go on.

Unless you got three more tickets.

Hey, man.

You tryin' to win one for your girlfriend?

I saw you walk up.

Oh, no, that's not my girlfriend.

That's just, uh...

That's just a friend, you know.

- Nice.

- Wow.

Can I get another one if I sink it again?

You're not supposed to.

But, uh, no one has to know.

Damn.

Disappoint.

Hmm.

What's there to do around here besides this dumb-ass carnival?

After my friend leaves, I mean.

Iclose up at 11:00.

I got some weed in my car.

Hell, yeah.

- One more?

- Really?

Yeah.

- Damn.

- Damn.

Lucky, lucky.

My luck's not gonna run out, is it?

No, man.

I'll see that it don't.

I'll see you in an hour?

Yeah, you will.

1 haven't thought much beyond this tape.

Icant

I don't know what's going to happen to you or what should happen to you.

I wake up nights sick to death wondering and hoping.

Hoping that whatever troubles you is over, and that if there is a god in heaven that you're just a regular girl with regular problems and regular pain, and that you stop wanting things you shouldn't want, maren.

And that your heart has a chance.

I knew that's how it would end.

"I hope you get better."

Maybe he's right, maybe I should pray that I wake up one day to find they built a maze around me.

Don't say that.

He's wrong.

He's wrong.

What happened to your dad?

You never say anything.

Nothing good.

Just a waste.

Except in my case, I gave him the tape.

Just give me a couple of minutes.

You made it.

- This is a good spot.

- Yeah, it's not bad.

- There's no one here.

- Is that you?

- Yeah.

- It's a nice truck.

Great, huh?

Yeah, she is. I'm parked up there.

Do you smoke?

What are you laughing about?

- Do you smoke weed too?

- Yeah.

You kinky fucker.

Yeah. Mmm.

Oh, yeah.

Faster, man. Jerk it faster. Come on.

I'm close, yeah. Yeah, like that.

Come on, come on, faster, man.

Faster, faster.

Yes.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, fuck!

Oh!

Faster, jerk it faster, man. Come on.

Yeah, I'm close.

Just like that. Ah! Ah!

I'm close, I'm close.

Here it comes. Here it comes.

That sure feels...

The world in the spring and a new skateboard from bikes unlimited.

Don't you love the smell of black rubber?

Maybe not.

It's an acquired taste.

Some people never get used to it.

Don't really understand.

You can work your way up.

Black spandex...

What's wrong?

That's the place listed on his license, but the lights are on.

I'm gonna go back and see if anyone's there.

No, no, hlgo, hlgo.

You have blood on you.

I cleaned up. He had wipes in the car.

You can take them if you want.

I'll see what I can see from the yard.

Okay.

All black. Completely hidden.

In my black cocoon,

I'm where no one can find me.

Maren, you okay?

What are you doing?

What? Oh, Christ.

Okay, we didn't know.

Hey, we didn't know, okay? Tsk.

Is he back?

No! Something's wrong, mom!

All right, we gotta go.

Let's go, let's go, let's go.

Focus, focus. Come on, let's go.

Only there did civilization arise.

Now, it's not my intention to give a history lesson, but I believe it's important to remind ourselves that in dealing with the economy, we 're dealing with human creativity.

This insight has represented the underpinning of our economic expansion...

There wasn't a car seat, maren.

He wasn't wearing a wedding ring.

We should feel something.

'Cause we murder people.

We steal their stuff, we move the fuck on, and we ruin lives that we don't even see.

Come on, why are we even talking about it like this?

We gotta do this! We have to do it!

Talking about the future, talking about being a friend to yourself.

You don't have that. This is too much.

No, we got 60, 70 years of this?

How dare you make this harder.

Maren, what do I...

What am I supposed...

How do I get you out of this?

What am I supposed to say right now?

Just drive.

Right. Tsk. All right.

You were dreaming.

We're almost there.

Uh, do you have a telephone book?

The one outside's missing.

I'm looking for someone in Bagley.

Oh, this is for the county, sweetie.

Thanks.

There.

- I'll come with you.

- No, stay here.

Excuse me? Are you Barbara kerns?

Wait, wait. Ms. Kerns. Ms. Kerns.

I'm maren yearly.

Maren.

I've travelled a very long way.

Oh, they didn't marry.

Mmm. Yeah, we wondered.

Huh.

My husband, uh, he died years ago.

Throat cancer.

Sorry.

Hmm.

Sorry to surprise you like this.

You didn't know your daughter had a child, I guess.

No. When she wanted to get married, we didn't agree.

So, it drove her away. Yeah.

Where did she meet my dad?

He didn't say?

He wouldn't say anything about her.

Mmm.

They met in college. Down in mankato.

She finished two years before he talked her into leaving.

Did he drive you here? Is he outside?

No. He's in Maryland.

Does he know you're here?

Yeah, he let me know where to find you.

So you haven't run away?

My dad thinks that I'm old enough to live on my own.

Oh. Uh-huh.

Well, if you're looking for a home with your mother...

I'm sorry to tell you that she... she's no longer with us.

What? When?

It's a lot of years now, and it's nothing I wanna tell you about.

I hope you can respect that.

Well, I'm her daughter.

Yep. Makes sense now.

Why she came back so bereaved.

That's the word.

And she wouldn't tell us anything, either.

It was...

It's just so much hiding in one family.

I'm sorry you had to be the child of it all.

Wait... what was she like as a child?

Hmm.

Wow. She was your only child?

Well, not even ours.

Bob and I never could have babies of our own.

But then we heard about Janelle.

She'd been left behind a sheriff's station in bemidji.

It was in the paper.

You know anything about her biological parents?

No, nothing.

Except what they did to their baby.

I mean, she could have froze, you know.

It's... cold here all the time.

My mother...

You can, you know, take those photos if you want 'em.

Did she ever hurt anyone?

What kind of question is that?

I bet she did. I know she did.

I don't know what you had to do to cover it up, or how much pain it caused you.

Stop this. At once.

Look, you're never going to see me again, okay?

You may not be her family by blood, but I am.

And I need to know.

So, please, Mrs. Kerns, please...

Then ask her yourself.

How?

Look, I don't know you.

You gotta understand.

I don't know what you wanted comin' up here.

And I hope you mean what you say about never coming back here.

I know that sounds cold, but I... I wanna be clear with ya.

I told you she was no longer with us but she's... not dead.

She's living in a town called Fergus falls.

In a state hospital there.

And... we didn't put her there, if that's what you're thinkin'.

She signed her own papers.

Okay.

Here. My mother's here.

Do you want me to come in?

Mrs. Kerns' daughter.

I sure didn't expect this when I woke up this morning.

Calm down.

Calm down.

Is she dangerous?

It's been many years since that was a concern.

Why was it ever one?

Aggression towards the staff. Self-harm.

But long ago.

It's possible she won't understand who you are.

She just took her morning meds, so she may nod off anyhow.

We'll see.

There's someone here to see you,

Ms. Kerns.

A surprise. A wonderful surprise.

It's maren.

I'm maren.

Can't she speak?

It's the medication.

Easy, Ms. Kerns.

I didn't come with dad.

I didn't come with dad.

Just... came by myself.

Should I give herthe letter, Ms. Kerns?

I fetched it on the way up.

She wrote this about 15 years ago now, must be.

I've kept it safe in her file out there, in case.

She knew I'd come?

I'll wait right over here.

Maren, if a day comes when you show up here,

I'll know it's because your father broke his promise.

Told you something about me.

And I'll know why.

He didn't know what I was when we married, but he figured it out by the time I had you.

I promised

I would never hurt either of you, but how could we be sure?

It wasn't easy to leave.

I loved you both so much.

I thought about ending my life, but I wanted to be here in case you ever did come.

All I ever wanted in this world was love.

I tried, believed, but we can't have it as we are.

All we can have is a little space with bars or a door that locks.

I'm sorry for that, little yearly.

For all the things I didn't do for you, and for the one thing I still can.

The world of love wants no monsters in it.

So let me help you out of it.

No! Help me!

Ms. Kerns, calm down!

Maren, die!

- Let me out. Let me out.

- Press the button on the door. Go!

Maren, die!

I can't open the door.

I can't open the door.

Sorry, sorry.

Here we go, here we go.

I can't fucking with the door.

You're good.

She's one of us.

She's one of us but she's fucking nuts.

She ate her own fucking hands.

She said she loved my dad.

She said she wanted to be a mom.

She could have stayed.

She could have told me what I needed to know.

About all of this. Fuck, you know how different this would've been if I'd had one person on my side?

One person to talk to?

You know what I wouldn't have done?

Maybe, probably half of what I've fucking done!

Fuck her. Fuck.

You know, if she'd stayed, she might have hurt you, maren.

Or worse, you might not even be here right now.

Trust me, I know what I'm talking about with this stuff.

This is better than what I went through.

Please just stop fucking talking!

You're pissed off, and you're scared, and you feel alone, and you don't know what to do with it all, it's fine.

If you wanna go at yourselfwith that,

I can't stop you.

But don't come at me.

You slit his throat, Lee.

- He had a wife. Kids.

- Okay.

I think you got used to being locked up and invisible and alone,

- and now you're out in the world,

-okay, okay.

And you're seeing yourself for the first time, and that's freaking you out.

But you know what?

It's fucking me up too, okay?

I feel like I'm seeing myself too.

That's how this works.

- How what works?

- This!

Whatever this is.

Stop. You're wrong, you're wrong.

What? About which part am iwrong?

I can't be around you anymore.

I can't think.

Jesus Christ.

We don't have many options, maren.

Either you eat, you off yourself, or you lock yourself up like her in there.

What's it gonna be?

Why can't you let me have this?

I'm not going to be her.

I'm not going to be her.

You can decide no.

And I'm deciding that right fucking now.

I'm just getting gas.

You have the money.

Maren!

Maren!

Yep. Right up there.

- Okay. I'll see you later.

- Okay.

- Bye.

- Bye.

Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes beautiful, beautiful brown eyes

Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes

I'll never love blue eyes again hey, hey.

You ain't sad to see old Sully, are you, missy?

It worked out.

I hardly believe it.

You've been following me since Frederick?

I know. It seems crazy to me too.

I just didn't,

I didn't know what else to do.

Why, Sully?

Well, because... we didn't have a chance to say our goodbyes.

And I've been worrying on you on your own as you are.

Why not say hello earlier then?

Oh, no, no, missy.

I don't... I don't interrupt.

That's bad manners, and you were with a friend.

And where... where'd he go now?

I... I saw him.

Took off out of here fast.

- Is he your new boyfriend? Is he?

- No, no, no.

Or just a hobo you're hanging around with?

No, I'm just a friend.

Oh. Just a friend.

Maybe he didn't...

Didn't get that telegram.

He one of us?

- Mom, Wednesday.

- All right.

Hey, grab some of those, will you?

Follow your nose or he follow his?

You got enough?

Both.

Thanks for showing me how.

Hey, count the bugs.

Well, life's never dully with Sully.

What do you say? Uh...

What do you say? You wanna...

Take a ride with Sully for a bit?

It's weird that you've been following me.

It's only been a couple of weeks.

Life will get weirder, I promise.

I promise.

Iliked...

I liked ourtalk.

Oh, it's a hard and lonesome road for us, isn't it?

So, there's no sense in making it lonelier if you don't have to.

I'm a girl.

I know. About my daughter's age, if I had one.

Is that what this is?

How do you like that?

Sully, I'm not trying to upset you.

Mmm-hmm.

Just, I know you drove a long way.

I don't feel comfortable with this.

You've never fit with someone before?

I have.

It's just gotta go both ways.

You don't like Sully.

Why do you say your name like you're two different people?

You don't like me.

No, I don't trust you.

It doesn't matter if I'm right or if I'm wrong about that, it just matters that I feel it.

So you're not gettin' in?

Not gettin' in.

Fuck you, then.

Fuck you, missy.

You dumb cunt!

I dried off next to you.

I've never done that with anyone... anyone before.

That means something.

I dried off next to...

Well, I know, but we had to invite him.

Your coffee.

Thanks.

How many times you gonna tell her before she starts to listen?

- Hi, guys.

- Hey, Sheila.

- Be right with you.

- Good to see you.

- Stay with daddy, all right?

- I'm bouncing so high.

I don't know.

Just come on, daddy, watch me.

Watch me.

There's glass all over here.

Get over here.

Coming, daddy.

I love you.

Hello?

Hey, idiot, how are you doin'?

Is it too late to call?

Where are you? You sound weird.

I'm driving home, actually.

Will you be here tonight?

Yeah, I'll be there super late.

But yeah, I'll get there.

Can you stay?

This time, I can. Yeah.

Oh, I'm really glad, Lee.

Me too.

Hey, what do you think about hittin' the kingdom when I'm back?

Going for a drive or something, huh?

Are you crying?

No. What?

Are... are you in trouble?

No, I'm driving home. I'm good.

Can I tell mom you're coming?

Sure you can.

Sure.

I don't even care about chores.

That's all I care about.

- It's so...

- You're right.

I mean, I cared about it before but not anymore.

- Yeah. Exactly.

- Hey, Kayla.

I'm maren, Lee's friend.

I met you at your aunt's house a couple of months back.

- I remember.

- Never seen her before.

I'll... I'll talk to y'all in a minute.

Yeah, I wanted to say hi then, but...

Do you know where Lee is?

Um, he was at my aunt's house for a while, but... my mom wouldn't leave him alone, so he took his tent and moved out to the lake.

Which lake?

Um, land between the lakes.

It's a state park down 641.

He comes into town when he wants to.

Well, he's just...

Going through something, I guess.

But I asked him about you, and he just said that you went another way.

I wondered why he's been staying.

I guess he was hoping that you'd show up, right?

No, I don't know about that.

I don't know if he'd actually even want to see me, to be honest.

I know he was trying to get back to you, though.

He said that?

God, he's an asshole.

Why is he even like this, you know?

I tell him no one even remembers all that stuff with the cops anymore.

It was three stupid days and they let him go.

This is about your dad?

He didn't tell you?

Our dad's a drunk.

So drunk that he'd piss on the wall kinda guy.

He got in Lee's face a couple of times and Lee would, you know, try to calm him down, and the day he left he wound up hitting Lee.

And when I tried to break 'em up, he hit me, too.

Lee just lost it, and he told me to call the cops.

And when our dad ripped the phone out of the wall,

Lee got him in a headlock.

He told me to run into town.

And when I got back with the cops,

Lee was pretty beat up and dad's car was gone.

And Lee told 'em that he took off, but there was blood on Lee.

So they had to put him in a holding cell so they could test it.

And for a minute there everyone was like,

"Lee killed him, Lee killed him."

But it was all Lee's blood.

It was all bullshit, and they had to let him go.

And that was four years ago, and he's been out of town for three and a half of 'em.

It's not fair.

It's not fair.

Lee!

Your tent.

We should really use it. Just get lost.

Where do you want to go?

I don't know. Anywhere.

West. Let's go west.

It's your rod bearings then.

Seriously? Shit!

That means a new engine.

I'd rather just sell it for parts.

Tell you what, you make me a good offer,

I'll sell it to you right now.

- You don't want to sell it out here.

- Why?

Look around, man.

How you gonna get home?

I don't know.

A thought that never changes remains a stupid lie it's never been quite the same no hearing or breathing no movement, no colors, just silence rise and fall of shame

You do go some place else.

Watching me read?

Yeah.

Well, you should know after this I'm out of books.

I'll have to go to a bookstore.

May have to stop on the way back, in Omaha.

By the way, those guys were saying we should have two days of water with us, in case the engine gives out.

In case we have to wait on a ride.

We should get some new wheels as soon as we can.

I wish we could save it.

I'd rather have a Van, anyway.

I learned how to drive in that truck.

You learned how to kiss in that truck.

I knew how to kiss before you,

Mr. Kentucky.

I sang to my girl in that truck.

Kayla told me about...

What happened with your dad.

Kayla doesn't know what happened.

He sounds like he was a fucking asshole.

I don't wanna...

I don't want to talk about my dad.

I don't sweat this stuff out like you do.

You know, Kayla said...

That he hit you both the day that he left.

That's true.

Told her to get the cops. She did.

And then he left.

I don't know,

I don't really believe that.

I mean, there must've been a lot of blood on you for the cops to bring you in.

If you wanna know, maren, he came for me, okay?

He tried to rip me open with his teeth.

That's the first time

I ever smelled it on someone.

What happened after that?

Lee...

You can tell me.

He, uh... he passed out.

I got him in a...

I put him in a fucking headlock, and bashed an ashtray over his head.

Dragged his fucking body to his car, put him in the car, and I drove to this barn about a mile outside town that I knew was abandoned.

How long was he in the barn?

Uh, three days.

I think, yeah.

Three days.

I duct-taped the shit out of him too.

Everywhere except his nostrils, so he could breathe.

And when I finally came back...

It's the sound he was making, it's the noise and the breathing.

He knew what was gonna happen.

What did you do?

I ate him right the fuck up.

And it felt fucking great.

I felt high as a motherfucker.

Probably would have killed myself if it weren't for Kayla.

I feel like I should have, you know.

No. No, stop.

I would have done the same thing.

- I would have done the same thing.

- Do you mean it?

I would have done it in my way, but I would have done it.

You protected the people that you love.

You don't think I'm a bad person?

All I think is that I love you.

Where do we go next?

Anywhere.

Let's drive back.

Until the truck gives out somewhere.

And then just stay.

We can get a place, jobs.

You know, like people do.

You wanna be people?

Let's be people.

Yeah. Let's be them for a while.

Yeah, we're in Ann arbor now.

Ann arbor.

Maren got a job at the university, at the bookstore, so, we're right near campus.

What'd you say?

Yeah, maybe if we're here long enough.

Hey, Kayla says hi.

- Hi.

- Maren says hi.

- She wants to come up.

- Yeah.

Lee, I brought your...

I'm gonna take my hand away and you're not gonna scream, because Sully's a friend, and we don't scream at friends.

Where's your... where's your cutie-pie?

I saw him.

I saw him walk out of here half an hour ago.

I don't know.

What's all this for, Sully?

Ever... since I drove away from you up there in Minnesota, nothing's felt right.

What does that mean?

It means...

It means...

It mea... it...

It means unfinished business.

Sully, me and Lee...

We are together now.

That's not the business

I'm talkin' about.

I don't mind.

I don't... I don't mind if you don't like Sully.

What I mind is how much you know about him in that little head of yours.

You don't think I'd tell anyone, right?

I mean, who would believe me?

And you're the one who told me you don't kill any...

You don't kill, right?

You told me that, Sully.

You know, I told... I used to try and tell people the truth, you know.

They never took me serious.

I just wanted to be...

I just wanted to be with someone who understood.

Do you know what I mean?

Do you?

Mmm.

Hmm.

Hmm.

Hey.

You never get sick of yourself?

Sullyjust wants to sleep at night.

That's all.

Sullyjust wants to sleep.

Sleep it off.

I said stop calling yourself Sully.

Shh!

Get off, maren. Get off.

Careful.

Come on.

That's the man you met, the one who followed you?

I smelled him two blocks from here.

How the fuck did he find you?

Oh, no.

Hang on.

Look.

Fuck, he hit your lung.

We gotta go to the er.

Air is coming out of this. I can see it.

He got Kayla.

He got Kayla.

Don't think about that right now.

Fuck.

Lee, we can't handle this by ourselves, and...

- Am I bad?

- No.

No, no, Lee. You're good, all right?

You're in shock.

- Am I bad?

- No.

We can't call an ambulance, Lee.

We can't let anybody in here.

We're... just gonna go.

Come on.

- I want you to eat first.

- Come on, Lee.

Come on.

- I want you to eat me.

- No.

- I want you to eat...

- I'm not gonna eat him.

- No. I want you to eat...

- I don't wanna.

I want you to eat me.

- I want you to eat. I want you to feed.

- No.

- I want you to eat.

- No.

- I don't wanna. I can't. Stop.

- I want you to do it, maren.

- I'm done here.

- No. No. No.

- I want you to do it, maren.

- Lee, stop.

- No. No, ican't.

- Bones and all.

I can't. Stop.

- It's beautiful.

- No. No. Stop.

Let me up. Let me up. Let me up.

- It's the easiest thing, maren, love.

- No. No. No.

- Just love me and eat.

- No. No.

I think you always had a feeling

Like you knew it all along

I kept believing now is never meant to be maybe I shall start alone

In a world that isn't hard in a place we shall meet for a minute just a minute we made it feel like home

For a minute just a minute we made it feel like...

Home home home home home home

This is what the cynics used to say.

Companies would refuse to look into the future.

They would say,

"Can we stop this virus?"

As if it was a negative progression.

But it's growing.

More and more, with a momentum that is unstoppable.

Now some kid snorts the entire load of his mother's spice cupboard.

Post that on YouTube.

They would watch as it becomes the buzz word amongst high school students everywhere.

Eventually, the cynicism is turning into awe.

Hi, David. Elizabeth.

Nice to meet you.

Hi, I'm David.

Hi, how are you? David.

Nice to meet you.

Listen, can I buy you a drink?

Can I buy you all drinks?

Sure. Why not?

I would love that.

That would be my pleasure.

What are you guys drinking?

Well, we were thinking shots.

You were thinking shots?

We just did shots of tequila.

Would you guys like a shot of tequila?

Bring it on.

Love it.

Excuse me. Bartender?

Can we get four shots of your finest tequila?

Thank you very much.

I can see you're very successful.

I think part of the secret to my success is attention to detail.

Detail?

Play the game.

What game?

Okay.

Blue or green?

I like games.

I like this game.

Blue. Green.

Green, it's green.

That's brown.

Wow, wow!

I don't know how you change the color of your eyes like that.

How do you do that so quickly? That's amazing.

That's a real talent.

Detail man.

Hey, buddy.

This guy, right here, fucking nailed it today.

I want you to know you fucking nailed it.

You're the man.

Your pitch, amazing. Listen, we're playing a game here.

Close your eyes again.

Blue or green?

Brown.

Fuck off.

All right. You, Loren, close your eyes.

Blue.

Blue.

You're just making that up.

See? He's good.

He's just picking colors randomly.

You can have his shot.

Excuse me. We need another shot, please.

(DAVID LAUGHS)

You can put these on me.

No, I told you,

I had it.

No, I have it.

I'll get the next round.

You're a strong, independent woman.

I like that.

I just gotta talk to you one more time.

Listen, your eyes, they're beautiful.

You know why I didn't get it right the first time?

Because it's like a collage.

Let me see them again.

Look at those eyes.

I know the color of your eyes!

David! Come on!

DAVID: Come on, we love that game.

That's so much fun.

It's okay, 'cause

I'm going this way.

You have a fucking baseball bat?

Yeah.

Hmm.

What is this shit you put in your hair?

Fuck you!

I'm doing a couple gigs.

Yeah. Sure.

Can I stay?

You want toast?

Just for a few days?

I'd stay with Mark, but he's being a fucking asshole.

BRANDON: Mark?

Please.

(BRANDON SIGHS)

Jesus, Sissy.

What do you expect?

Pretty please?

Look, you get the sofa and you get your ass off it before I leave every morning.

I will. I promise.

I will. (KISSES)

'Cause if you need some money...

Honestly,

I even make money now and everything.

Yeah, sure.

Huge amounts.

What, you collect it in that hat?

(LAUGHING)

You should come and hear me.

Yeah, I will.

"Yeah, I will"?

Like,

"Yeah, I will," like last time?

Please come.

Where'd you get this, anyway?

It's vintage.

Yeah.

Don't tell me.

No cabs.

No, your wife wouldn't let me leave this morning.

Hey. That's not cool.

(LAUGHS)

Yes. Like, 50.

(PAPER RUSTLING)

Whoa!

So, how'd it go last night?

Got home, went to bed.

Good night.

Uh-huh. Right, right.

Let's do it again tonight.

Some place classier, though.

Yeah, my sister's playing downtown somewhere.

She's playing?

She's a musician.

Well, she's a singer.

Okay. Yeah, yeah.

You know what?

That sounds like a lot of fun.

And that will ruin your enamel.

Reservation. Sullivan?

I could follow that forever.

Nice pick. (SNIGGERS)

Hi, guys. How are you both doing tonight?

What can I get you?

Are you...

You're from...

Brazil.

Rio? Hmm?

São Paulo.

Oh!

That is a beautiful city.

That's...

(LAUGHS)

You've been there?

Once or twice.

Can we get two dry martinis with olives?

Mmm-hmm.

And a little bit later, why don't you come by for a drink with us?

I'll make sure

I get those drinks.

Thank you.

Thanks.

She would be so offended if I didn't try.

Unbelievable.

I'm leaving today

I wanna be a part of it

New York

I wanna wake up in a city

That doesn't sleep

And find

I'm king of the hill

Top of the heap

These vagabond shoes

Are longing to stray

Right through the very heart of it

New York, New York

If I can make it there

I'll make it

Anywhere

It's up to you

New York, New York

I wanna wake up in a city

That doesn't sleep

And find

I'm king of the hill

Head of the list

Cream of the crop

At the top of the heap

These little town blues

Are melting away

I'll make a brand new start of it

In old New York

If I can make it there

I'll make it

Anywhere

It's up to you

New York

(APPLAUSE)

Wow. Wow! Bravo!

(LAUGHS)

She's good!

She's good!

DAVID: Hi.

SISSY: Hi.

I'm David.

Sissy.

It is a pleasure to meet you.

Nice to meet...

I think you are absolutely fantastic and you look great in the dress, too.

Please, sit down.

Thank you.

What did you think?

Yeah, it was interesting.

(LAUGHING)

What do you mean?

No, it was...

It was good.

It was good.

It was good?

He was crying.

He was crying.

There were tears coming down his face.

I saw it. You made a grown man cry.

Really?

Mmm-hmm.

I'm gonna get some drinks.

That's a great idea.

Why don't you get a round for the table, buddy?

Okay. I'm really sorry about that.

He's had a rough day at work.

I think he's a little bit emotional right now.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So you guys grew up in Jersey?

Yeah.

You still live there?

God, no.

That's good. That's good.

Where do you live now?

Kind of all over the place.

Yeah?

What's the last city you've been to?

L.A.

Los Angeles?

Mmm-hmm.

Oh, boy.

You like it there?

I mean,

I'm going back.

That must mean you love it then, huh?

No! I can't even fucking drive.

Wait a minute.

You can't drive?

It's a nightmare.

Nope.

Why not?

I tried when I was a kid and I was horrible.

Wait, how old were you when you quit driving?

Sixteen.

You were 16 years old?

Mmm-hmm.

So, wait a minute.

How do you get along in Los Angeles?

I take the bus.

No. No, no, no.

Look, a girl like you cannot be taking the bus.

What happened to your arm here?

Oh!

When I was a kid,

I was bored.

You must have been really bored.

I was.

All right, we've got a problem.

Your sister cannot be taking the bus anywhere, okay?

I know a guy who owns a car rental company.

We're gonna get you a car, we're gonna drive around in circles in a parking lot and you are going to learn how to drive.

Not stick, automatic.

It's a little easier.

I would love that.

You'd love that. That's good.

You know what? Better yet, we're gonna get you a golf cart and you will drive the golf cart around.

Wow. Now we're talking.

Everybody should drive golf carts.

A golf cart right up

Fifth Avenue, huh?

(LAUGHS)

You know, they should.

They should.

It would be a lot cleaner and greener.

It would be great for the city. Brandon, what do you think?

Sounds great.

Yeah?

I love your brother.

What an amazing man.

How long are you here for?

I don't know.

You don't know?

Can I see you again? Please?

Is that too forward?

I find you fascinating.

I really do.

I think you're a fascinating creature.

I'd love to see you again.

Listen, why don't we...

This is a celebration, let's get champagne.

Yes! Champagne!

Champagne for everybody.

The whole table!

Come on.

Champagne.

I've got it, I've got it.

Get out, get out, get out.

Come here, come here, come here.

(SQUEALS) No!

Come on, come on with me.

Get off. Get off.

How did that work?

Get off me.

Come on, come on.

(ELEVATOR DINGS)

Hey, slacker.

Your computer's back.

Dave's looking for you.

DAVID: Yeah. It was really great last night.

BOY ON COMPUTER:

Daddy, Daddy.

Listen, I gotta go, okay?

Thanks for calling.

Hey, buddy. Listen, we said an hour French, and then Isobel's gonna pick you up because Mommy's picking up Nathan.

All right?

You can go after.

Yeah, I know, but Mommy says I can't.

Okay. Well, let's go talk to Mommy. Hmm?

(GROANS)

She's all the way downstairs.

Well, go downstairs and tell her that Daddy said it's okay for you to go to Jason's.

(GROANS)

Huh? Come on.

How about that? Do it.

You can do it. Get up.

Okay.

Yeah.

Mommy? Mommy?

(LAUGHING)

What's up, man?

Steven said you wanted to see me.

Yes.

Dude, 9:00 this morning, where were you?

Dentist. Root canal.

Oh, shit.

Now, what did I tell you about that?

Who did you see?

Gary Sher,

King's practice,

West 57th Street.

Good. Good. You're stinging the company health plan,

I hope, right?

Sure.

That's what it's there for, man.

All right, brother.

Listen, one more thing.

Your hard drive is filthy, all right?

We got your computer back.

I mean, it is dirty.

I'm talking like hoes, sluts, anal, double anal, penetration, interracial facial, man.

Cream pie...

I don't even know what that is.

You think it was your intern?

On my hard drive?

Yeah, someone's fucking with your account, man.

And we're blowing our wad in cash, you know?

It takes a really, really sick fuck to spend all day on that shit.

Daddy, Daddy.

Yeah. Hey, buddy.

What'd she say?

She said I can go to Jason's for a half hour, but I have to be home by 5:00 for dinner.

Okay. That's great. See?

Best of both worlds.

You got everything you want. You happy?

Yup. Yup.

Yeah. You better be.

Get out of here.

Okay.

All right, see you.

Hey. You like your sugar?

I do.

(WOMAN SHOUTING)

(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

Hey.

Hello.

Hello.

Did you find it okay?

Yes, I'm glad you made it.

Yeah?

I'm late. Sorry.

MARIANNE:

You look handsome.

You look amazing.

Hi.

Thank you.

How are you doing tonight?

Thank you.

Okay.

I have a few specials on the menu, if you'd like to hear them?

Sure.

The soup of the day is tomato with basil oil and parmesan crostini.

The special is marinated swordfish, tabouleh and

Moroccan charmoula.

It's really good.

We're also serving a DeBragga and Spitler

New York Strip with a side order of fries, and the salad is snow pea and radish with a cider vinaigrette.

Can I start you off with a sparkling water?

(CLEARS THROAT)

Tap water's fine.

Okay.

And the wine menu is right next to...

Yup, there you go.

You want some wine?

Sure.

White? Red?

Red. Maybe...

Pinot Noir is light, if you like it, like, light.

Great.

Okay. I'll be back.

So...

(LAUGHING)

(CHUCKLING)

Where do you live?

Brooklyn.

Nice.

Born and raised.

Where you from?

I was born in Ireland and we moved here when I was a teen.

Did you get back much?

Thank you.

A couple times.

A big family?

You miss them?

Uh...

I have a sister.

I have two.

Oh, yeah?

Yeah.

Older? Younger?

Older and younger.

I'm right in the middle.

What?

Just wondering.

(LAUGHING)

Are you nervous?

Why would I be nervous?

You look a little nervous.

Do I?

No.

Well, what's a date?

It's no big deal.

It took me an hour to figure out what to wear.

You chose wisely.

Yeah.

I'm sorry, but I forgot to say the crab comes in the shell.

Great.

Oh! Yeah. I haven't even looked at this.

I'll have the lamb.

The lamb.

I'll have the lamb, too.

That sounds great.

Okay.

No appetizer?

(GIGGLING)

I'm fine.

No.

Okay. And how would you like the lamb?

Medium.

We recommend it pretty pink.

Okay.

Yeah?

Okay. Pink it is.

Thank you.

Excuse me.

So you seeing anyone at the moment?

No, I'm not.

Are you seeing anyone?

No.

No? Really?

Why is that?

I don't know.

It's just the way it is.

It's just the way it is.

Yeah, I...

Actually, I'm separated.

Tragedy.

Yeah.

Kind of a recent thing.

Okay.

You were married for long?

No.

Did we decide on the wine?

Well, yeah. Was it the

Pinot Noir, you said?

Yeah, great.

Great choice. Okay.

I wasn't married long.

Gave it a shot.

It didn't really work out.

No.

Wow.

What?

You just seem, like...

What?

Averse to the whole idea.

Well, yeah.

I just don't understand why people would want to get married.

Especially nowadays,

I mean, it's...

You know?

I don't see the point.

In relationships?

It doesn't seem realistic.

Are you serious?

I mean...

Yeah. I am, really.

Well, then, you know, why are we here, if we don't matter to one another?

Well...

Why are you here?

The food is supposed to be great here. (CHUCKLES)

No, no, no.

I'm not saying it like that.

I mean...

I just mean...

You know?

One person for the rest of your life?

I mean, it's...

I mean, you come to restaurants, you see couples sitting together, and they don't even speak to one another, they don't have anything to say.

They probably don't have to speak because they're connected.

Or they're just bored with one another.

Every...

Here we go.

What's your longest relationship?

Um...

Exactly.

That's...

You can pour.

Sure.

Four months.

You have to commit.

You have to actually give it a shot.

(LAUGHING) I did.

For four months.

For four months.

(INAUDIBLE)

Thank you.

Look, touch that.

Your head?

(BARKS)

(SQUEALS)

No, no, no.

(LAUGHING)

You're such a weirdo.

No, seriously, seriously, seriously. Touch it.

Okay.

Oh, my God.

Do you feel that?

Yeah, what is it?

It's a remnant.

A remnant?

Yeah, from the Neanderthals.

There's only a few of us left since the

Homo sapiens took over.

Okay.

Hmm.

That would explain the forehead.

What's that supposed to mean?

"What's that supposed to mean?"

What do you mean?

(GIGGLING)

Seriously, how did you get it?

What is it?

I used to play this game with my cousin...

Mmm-hmm.

...where I'd sit on his feet and he'd fly me through the air.

I hit my head off the ceiling and I blacked out.

I was knocked out for five or 10 minutes.

I peed my pants.

Oh!

If you had a choice to live in the past or the future, and you could be anything you wanted to be, what would you be?

What would you be?

Well, I always wanted to be a musician in the '60s.

That's cool.

A musician?

Yeah.

'60s is tough, though.

I saw Gimme Shelter recently, you know, the Rolling Stones documentary?

Yeah.

It kind of seemed like hell.

What?

Yeah, the '60s would be, like, the last place

I would want to be.

No way!

Yes.

Ugh! Chaos!

So where and what would you wanna be?

Um...

You know, here, now.

That's boring.

Fuck you.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Okay. Well, this is me.

This is you?

This is me.

Thank you very much,

Brandon.

Thank you very much,

You can't help yourself.

It's disgusting.

Why are you so fucking angry?

Why am I so fucking angry?

That's my boss.

You sleep with him after 20 minutes.

Now you're calling him up.

What's the matter with you?

You know he's got a family, right?

You know he's got a family?

No.

You didn't see the wedding ring on his finger?

No.

You're a liar.

I'm sorry.

You're always sorry.

That's all you ever fucking say.

Well, at least

I say I'm sorry.

Try doing something.

Actions count, not words.

I'm sorry.

I fucked up.

I'm not perfect.

I make mistakes, but I'm trying.

Some people fuck up all the time.

Look, just forget it.

This isn't working out.

Obviously.

You need to find somewhere else to live.

I don't have anywhere else to go.

This isn't about him.

I make you angry all the time and

I don't know why.

No. You trap me.

You force me into a corner and you trap me.

"I've got nowhere else to go."

I mean, what sort of fucking shit is that?

You're my brother.

So what?

I'm responsible for you?

Yes.

No, I'm not.

Yes, you fucking are.

No, I didn't give birth to you.

I didn't bring you into this world.

You're my brother,

I'm your sister.

We're family.

We're meant to look after each other.

You're not looking after me.

I'm looking after myself.

I'm trying.

I'm trying to help you.

How are you helping me, huh?

How are you helping me?

How are you helping me?

Huh? Look at me.

How are you helping me?

You come in here and you're a weight on me.

Do you understand me?

You're a burden.

You're just fucking dragging me down.

How are you helping me?

You can't even clean up after yourself.

Stop playing the victim.

I'm not playing the fucking victim.

If I left, I would never hear from you again.

Don't you think that's sad?

You're my brother.

Why is it always so dramatic with you?

Everything is always the end of the world.

It's not fucking dramatic.

I'm trying to talk to you.

I don't wanna talk.

Try not talking.

Try just listening or thinking for a change.

Yeah, 'cause that's working great for you.

You're completely fine.

I've got my own fucking apartment.

Oh, whoopee-fucking shit.

You have your own apartment, that's amazing.

You have a job and an apartment.

I should be in awe of you.

Well, at least

I'm responsible for it.

At least I don't depend on people all the time.

You're a dependency.

You're a parasite.

You don't have anybody.

You don't have anybody.

You have me and your fucking pervert boss.

You slept with that fucking pervert boss.

What does that make you?

Don't talk to me about sex life, Brandon.

Not from you.

Whatever.

I'm going out.

Great. And then you'll come back and we'll just have the same fucking conversation again.

No, you'll move out.

And then I'll never hear from you again?

I like the way it's just me and it.

I wanna taste you.

I wanna slip my tongue inside you, just as you come.

-Je ne sais pas.

-On a déjà parlé d'Aragon ici.

Vous étiez présente, non ?

Enfin, physiquement, je veux dire.

Faites un effort.

Donnez-moi une réponse.

-Elle s'en va.

-Elle se marie ?

-Oui.

Avec un type de maths. Un con.

-Elle arrête ?

-Ouais.

-En même temps,

ça vaut peut-être mieux.

-Ça en fait encore une de moins.

C'est l'hécatombe.

Il ne restera plus que vous à la fin.

-Tu comptes rester jusqu'à la fin ?

-Mademoiselle.

Alors, ce poème, je vous écoute.

-À travers le drame amoureux, il parle du drame national.

Au fond, c'est un propos politique.

-Hm hm.

Parlez-moi du motif récurent de ces vers.

L'incendie, la tragédie, la mémoire.

-Pour moi, ils font référence à la guerre.

On est en 1942 au moment de la publication du texte.

Elsa Triolet et Aragon sont communistes.

Alors, je pense que les deux espèrent un réveil patriotique.

-Parfait. Comment s'appelle la figure de style qui fait revenir ces mots régulièrement ?

-Une anaphore.

-Une anaphore. Non, mais alors, toi !

-Non.

-Mais je lui ai dit que ça allait.

-ÂAlors, les études ?

-Elle va bientôt avoir son diplôme avec mention.

-Arrête.

-Quoi ? C'est pas vrai ?

-C'est pas encore fait.

-Ça va, fais pas la modeste. On sait que t'es douée. T'as de la chance.

Tiens, regarde tes mains, comme elles sont blanches.

Ça se voit que tu travailles pas avec.

IIs m'ont collée à la teinture,

-Hm hm.

Je vais te faire ton lit.

Tiens.

Quoi ?

T'achèteras un roman.

-On s'est pas vus depuis 3 mois ?

Depuis votre grippe, l'hiver dernier ?

Vous êtes une drôle, vous.

Vous aviez tellement peur de rater les cours.

C'est pas toujours le cas.

C'est ici que vous avez mal ?

-Pas seulement.

-Quel genre de douleurs ?

-Ça fait comme des crampes.

-Enlevez votre culotte, s'il vous plaît.

Pliez les jambes.

Avez-vous un retard de menstruations ?

Vous avez déjà eu des rapports ?

-Non.

-Jamais ?

-Jamais.

-Vous n'avez pas de fiancé ?

-Non.

-Vous êtes enceinte, mademoiselle.

Je suis désolé.

-C'est pas possible.

-Je sais ce que ça représente pour vous.

-Faites quelque chose.

-Vous ne pouvez pas me demander ça.

Ni à moi ni à qui que ce soit.

La loi ne fait pas de cadeau.

Toute personne qui vous aiderait finirait en prison. Vous avec.

S'il vous arrive pas le pire.

Tous les mois, une autre tente sa chance et meurt dans d'atroces souffrances.

Vous ne voulez pas être de celles-là.

-C'est pas juste.

Ça tiendra peut-être pas,

ça va pas forcément au bout.

-Peut-être, oui.

-Anne !

Ben alors, t'étais où ?

-Lä-haut.

Staline, il nie les crimes de masse.

Elle s'est occupée de moi.

Dis que tu viens de la part de la fille du journal. Elle comprendra.

-D'accord.

C'est un avantage.

Souris, s'il te plaît.

Et puis, c'est propre.

Elle fait bouillir tous ses instruments.

-Ça fait mal ?

-L'été dernier, quand je suis retournée chez mes parents, j'ai eu une relation avec un homme.

Ça a duré un mois.

Il était beaucoup plus vieux que moi.

On a souvent fait l'amour.

Chez lui.

Dans la grange, près de la maison.

N'importe où.

Dès que c'était possible.

J'avais honte, mais l'envie était plus forte que tout.

Je suis pas tombée enceinte.

C'est un hasard.

J'ai juste eu plus de chance que toi.

Tu as trouvé l'adresse que tu cherchais ?

On n'en parle pas, hein ?

- Mm-hmm. and you nearly... & up time. Hmm?

- Yeah.

- Come on.

- Mmm...

- Hey, come on, stop that.

Gotta get right to it for grizzle, remember?

Lou: Okay.

I got some smoothie for you.

You're gonna fucking hate it, but it's healthy.

Want some?

I wouldn't recommend it.

- It's disgusting.

- Mm-mm.

No? No? Okay.

Ruben: and I would do anything for love  but he won't do that  what's the thing that he won't do in that song?

What's left for him to not do?

Lou: Anal. no, no, but I won't do that 

Ruben: he won't do that 

Ruben: I used to imagine

Jeff goldblum was my dad.

Saw him in the fly, I was like,

"that must be what my dad looks like."

Also explains a lot, because the dude's fucking weird.

- But he looks like me, man.

- It's true, yeah.

Yeah!

You look like Jeff goldblum.

Ruben: Why is it okay to, like, use a toothpick in public but not floss?

- Have you ever tried that?

- Lou: To floss in public? No.

Ruben: You're at dinner, pull out some...

Lou: I used to imagine my funeral a lot when I was a kid,

- at school, in math.

- Ruben: Fun!

I used to daydream about it, then make myself cry!

Uh, yeah,

I think I'd get cremated.

- What about you?

- Ruben: Cremated, or, like, ust fed to the birds, you know?

Lou: Well, you know, now you can get ashes put into tattoo ink.

- My face on your back.

Ruben: This?

Lou: Where the clown is.

- Ruben: What?

- Lou: Yeah.

Ruben: scary clown face  scary clown face 

We don't need to put them all out.

I know, but we need to fill them up a little bit.

Okay.

You wanna put out some different ones?

Hmm?

That's the face of a sale.

Okay, this one costs about 50 bucks extra because...

- It's an original artwork.

- I'm gonna spit on it.

- Fifty dollars.

- Okay, 100 bucks.

It's probably a two out of ten, in terms of his hearing.

He can't... he's having trouble even communicating with me.

I gotta see a doctor?

He... he can see you now.

- What?

- He can see you right now.

- Now? Where's...?

- Yes. I... I...

Hey, Lulu. I'm sorry.

I had to run out, baby.

I gotta deal with some shit, okay?

Don't worry about anything, okay?

Receptionist: Mr. stone?

Oh. Oh, yeah.

Doctor:

Okay, how is that volume?

Is the volume loud enough?

Good.

- Can you hear me?

- What?

Can you hear me okay?

Volume-wise?

- I can hear you.

- Okay.

I'm gonna say these words.

I want you to repeat them back to me.

I'm gonna start with ust your right ear.

This is your chart, Ruben.

Now, as far as the volume that you can hear...

You, on your right ear, were 28 percent, and on your left ear, you were 24 percent.

- It's what?

- In the left ear,

- you came in at 24 percent.

- Okay.

No matter how loud I made the test,

I could have put itat 11...

You were still going to miss

70 to 80 percent of the words that I said.

- Okay.

- That is not good.

Yeah, I see that, so, what...?

What can we do about it?

How do I get it back?

Well, um, you have to understand something here.

Whether or not this is related to your exposure to noise or it's an autoimmune issue...

Doesn't really matter.

I understand I got a problem.

I'm asking you what I can do about it.

Well, what you can do about it first is to eliminate all exposure to loud noises.

And then, we can run some tests, and we can determine exactly what is going on with your ears.

And if we do, then we can have our other conversations.

You could have what?

Well, there are implants that bypass the cochlea.

You said implants?

- Yes.

- Those work?

For people with severe hearing loss or complete deafness, yes, they help.

Well, then let's do that.

Well, it's not that simple.

Uh, it's a very involved process, and it's quite costly.

- How much is it?

- Well, they can run between 40 and 80,000 dollars, depending, and they are not covered by insurance.

Okay.

And, um...

Like, when can you do it?

You got them in stock now?

Mr. stone, your hearing...

Is deteriorating rapidly.

Am I right?

And over the next few days...

Or even hours, it's going to continue.

And the hearing that you have lost is not coming back.

You have to understand, your first responsibility...

Is to preserve the hearing you have.

Lou: Ruben, what the fuck?

Ruben!

I can't hear anything.

What?

I can't hear anything.

Yes, it will come back.

I have to...

There's, like, a surgery.

- What?

- It's simple. It's all it is.

There's an implant.

They put it in your shit.

It's like a...

Okay? It'll come back.

It's fine, Lou.

It's like 40 grand, 80 grand, whatever, but it's...

It will come back.

- Till then, we ust keep going.

- No.

Lou. Listen to me. =no.

Let's play tomorrow, see what it's like. Let's try it.

I'm gonna be like a click track.

You can play to me.

- No.

- Huh? You can adj...

It's different, but it is what it is, Lou.

Lou, we have a...

Lou, we have a tour booked.

- It's not safe.

- We have a tour booked.

We have a tour booked, Lou.

It doesn't matter.

It's not safe!

- Ruben!

- I fucking knew it.

I'm going back.

Ruben: Yo!

Buddy, you got a smoke, please?

This is ridiculous.

He's sleeping.

Hi. Hi, Hector?

Hi, this is Lou. Ruben's having a bit of trouble right now.

- Hey, Hector, what's up?

- He's had some hearing problems.

Yeah, I mean, I can put him on, but he won't be able to hear you.

Okay.

Talk to him. Talk to him.

Hey, Hector, what's going on, man?

It's Ruben. I'd say it's good to hear your voice, but I can't hear a word you're saying, so this is completely pointless.

Lou wanted me to call you because I had a cigarette.

Uh, you know, not great, not ideal, but considering the circumstances, which are pretty fucked up...

You know, understandable.

I'd say understandable.

For everyone apart from Lou, it seems.

Um, I got this, bro.

You'd probably be asking me if I'm steady right now, if I'm feeling level.

Not completely, but I'm cool.

You'd tell me Serenity is something you get when you, uh, stop wishing for a different past.

Bro, I love you, man.

Oh, my manager wants the phone back, so I gotta go.

Okay, love you, bro.

Hey. Yeah, he...

He can't hear a word.

Well, if you get him to a group, then how's he gonna hear?

Okay.

Okay, thanks, Hector. Thank you.

When? When...?

Okay, yeah,

I'll make sure it's on loud.

Okay, thank you so much.

Thank you.

Okay, bye.

He's gonna call back.

What did he say?

Write it down. What did...?

He'll call back.

He's gonna call back.

That's all? Fucking Hector.

What are we gonna do now?

What do you wanna do, Lou?

Huh?

Ruben: Fuck this.

It's Hector.

Hey.

Yeah, he's here.

Lou: Not so good.

Oh, o... okay.

Uh, yeah, what is it, and...?

- What? What's the plan?

- Uh...

Well, we're in Missouri, so that's gonna take a few days.

I don't really know.

No, no, no, we'll leave right away.

Lou: Okay, yeah.

Okay, thank you so much.

I really, really appreciate it.

Thank you.

No, yeah, I'll tell him.

Okay, bye.

What?

He's found a place.

Ruben: Is that him?

Joe: Ruben.

I'm sorry. I don't know that...

I'm Ruben.

This is Lou.

Hi, I'm... I'm Lou.

I'm sorry, I read lips.

- My name is Lou.

- Lou.

- I'm Joe.

- Hi, Joe.

Mind if I borrow him for a minute?

No.

You mind watching my beast here for me

- while we have a talk?

- Oh, okay.

Lou, this is Luis.

He's my hearing dog.

He let me know you were here.

I named him after Luis aparicio from the white sox in '59.

You wanna be friends, give him these.

- Oh, sure. Yeah.

- Okay?

Yo, what about...?

Lou, you coming?

No, no, no, you.

- You sure?

- Yeah.

- I won't be long, okay?

- Okay.

Joe: You be a good boy.

Okay, uh...

Test.

Joe: Oh.

Okay. So, it works.

Is this okay for you?

Yeah, can you hear me?

No, I'm gonna read your lips.

I might miss some things, but I'm gonna try, okay?

- Okay.

- Try to speak clearly.

Yeah.

How are you, Ruben?

I'm okay.

You're an addict?

Yep.

What sort of drugs?

What did I take?

Joe: Mm-hmm.

Everything.

Um...

Mainly heroin.

Heroin.

Have you thought about using since you lost your hearing?

Today is not a good day.

I'm not thinking clear today.

Let's talk about me.

I'm an alcoholic.

I lost my hearing in the Vietnam war when a bomb exploded near me.

I still remember the music

I was listening to when that bomb went off.

After that...

I lost everything else.

My wife. My kid.

Not because of being deaf, mind you, Ruben.

It was the beer.

How long you been clean?

- Four years.

- Four?

Mmm.

And you need some help right now?

You know, I should check on Lou.

How long you two been together?

Four years.

You play music, right?

Ein a a fe if a no, not anymore.

Not until I get the implant.

Implant.

Yeah, sorry, you know about these implants they got now?

It's like a...

They have implants.

I know, yes.

Expensive.

Yeah, thank you. Yes, they are.

Joe: So...

You should understand that, uh, this is a deaf community.

Not ust my program, but we're part of a larger deaf community.

And my program, and the people in it, they benefit tremendously from that deaf community.

We work with them, and they work with us.

But it's very important, if you wanna be here, to understand that we're looking for a solution to...

To this.

Not this.

Why don't you go invite Lou in here?

Sure.

Ruben: Lou!

This guy wants to talk to you.

Okay.

Well, I think it's important that you stay here with us right now, Ruben.

Learn some sign language...

Find some solid ground.

What do you think?

Man, that sounds great, but we don't have a lot of money now.

Joe: Well, sometimes our church sponsors deaf people in need, and right now, you fit the bill, Ruben.

We're really not

- churchgoing people.

- Sorry, I read...

Sorry, Ruben, I read lips.

I can't... what'd you say?

We're not religious, either of us.

- Joe: Oh.

- Very much not into religion.

No offense, you know.

Religion plays no part in this,

Ruben.

The church helps people in need, not religious people.

The important thing is that you wanna stay here.

Ruben: Mmm.

- Yeah.

- Lou...

Do you think Ruben needs help right now?

You understand if, uh,

Ruben were to stay here, he'd have to do it on his own.

Members live in a house separate from the outside world.

No contact to the outside world.

No phones.

I've found that in all cases, that's the way it works best.

Yo, hold up a minute, okay?

Let me catch up. Okay?

Can you help

Ruben commit to that, Lou?

Wanna try this for a couple days?

We have our own home.

We can stay in the rv.

I'm sorry to say, that's not the way it works here.

Well, that's a problem, then.

Do you have anywhere you can be during this time, Lou?

Yo, that's that, man.

We're done.

We're done. Thanks a lot for your time, bro.

Appreciate it, okay?

We're out, baby. Let's go.

Hey.

Lou, ahem,

I'm thinking we should still go hit our fucking show in Dayton, okay?

I can fucking watch you for cues.

It was rocky last time, but we weren't on the same page.

Now you know what's up.

I can fucking watch you.

And I know this shit inside out.

Okay? Yo, I can fucking make it work until we have enough for surgery.

Okay? We're gonna get there.

Yo, seriously, we're good to go.

Lou.

Hmm?

Hey, I'll deal with this shit.

I'll deal with it.

You know I will.

It's ust money.

You know that, right? Huh?

Come here.

Ruben!

Ruben!

Ruben! Stop it!

Ruben!

Look at me, I'm not going back to that fucking place, okay?

Ruben: I know, I know. I'm...

Well, then fucking support me!

How's about that?

Fucking support me, Lou! Huh?

- You don't wanna be here?

- Of course I do.

I knew it. I fucking knew it.

I knew this was coming.

I fucking knew it. This is about the fucking album, huh?

What happened?

You get a better offer?

- What are you talking about?

- Huh?

I can't hear you. I can't fucking hear you, understand?

I can't... I'm fucking deaf!

I'm fucking deaf!

No fucking hearing! Okay? Okay?

No, what I need is a fucking gun in my mouth.

What I need is a fucking gun in my fucking mouth, okay?

Look, I'm sorry.

Lou, I'm ust fucked up, Lou.

I ust need a little...

I need a minute to think, okay?

There's gotta be another way. Lou?

Hello?

Hey.

Oh, really?

- Oh.

- Who is that?

Okay, well, I need to get ready.

Okay, no, I'll get a cab.

Yeah, it's fine.

Okay, bye.

What's going on?

Huh? What's going on?

I'm getting on a plane. You're gonna go back to that place.

Slow down, okay? Slow down.

Yo, chill, dude, we're gonna be a minute. Just chill, okay?

Ahem, ust slow down a minute.

Lou. Lou. This is so fucked up.

Who's gonna be looking out for you over there? Hmm?

- Who's gonna look out for you?

- It's okay.

I need more of a plan, Lou.

- Ruben.

- T need...

I need more from you, Lou!

I need more of a plan, Lou.

You can't ust fucking...

Aw, Jesus! Lou, come on.

Ruben, Ruben.

You hurt yourself?

Ruben, you hurt yourself...

You hurt me.

I'll hurt myself too.

- I'll hurt myself too.

- Don't say that.

Promise.

Say it, Ruby, or all of this is for shit! Say it! Promise!

Go back there right now!

Promise! Say it!

- I'll promise if you...

- No! Say it! Promise!

- Go back to that place.

- Only if... I need...

I need you to wait for me.

Okay? You're it for me, Lou.

You're my fucking heart.

You're it for me, okay?

You gotta wait for me.

Fuck.

Listen to me, listen, listen.

When you get there,

I need you to...

I need you to write to me, okay?

Yeah? Will you write me and tell me you're okay?

Huh? Promise me.

And, listen, if it's bullshit, you ust get your ass back here.

I'll fix it. I swear to god.

You know I'll fucking fix this.

It's not that hard, okay?

Just come back here.

- I love you.

- My fucking heart.

Okay?

Motherfucker.

Oh, motherfucker.

Motherfucker.

Oh, fuck.

Oh...

Fuck.

Motherfucker.

Ruben: What's up?

Yo. Hey.

You want my car keys?

If I ask for them back,

I want them back, okay?

We're not doing that.

God, Grant me the Serenity to accept the things

I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.

Your name.

My name's Ruben.

I'm an addict.

I have four years clean now.

I'm sorry,

I don't talk sign language.

That's it.

My name is shaheem.

I'm a heroin addict.

Fuck.

Ruben: Okay.

What?

What?

Okay.

I know!

Um, I don't... sorry.

Ruben.

Ruben.

Ruben: Okay.

Ruben: Oh.

Ruben: Okay.

Yeah.

Uh, I'm coming, okay?

One minute.

I'll be back.

Fuck.

Oh, hey, Joe.

Joe: What was that all about,

Ruben?

What, with your roof?

I was fixing your roof.

One of the eaves s...

I was trying to fix your roof.

You don't need to fix anything here.

Okay.

I've got a little assignment for you, okay?

You get up early, right?

Yeah, pretty early, yeah.

I'll have hot coffee waiting for you at 5:30.

Early enough for you?

I don't know, I guess.

Okay, 5.

And I'll, uh...

Provide a room for you.

- What for?

- And there's nothing that needs to be accomplished in this room.

All I want you to do is ust...

Sit.

All I ask is if and when you cannot ust sit...

You turn yourself to the pen and paper that I'm gonna supply for you.

And I want you to...

Write.

Doesn't matter what you write, how you write, whether it's spelled correctly...

Or if it's ust a big, pthht, mess.

I don't care.

No one will read it, okay?

But I want you to keep writing continuously, without stopping, until you feel like you can...

Sit again.

Does it have to be writing?

And if...

Sometime in the future, it feels like it's a little bit too difficult for you, you should come and find me.

I'll be in my apartment...

Doing the same thing as you, okay, Ruben?

I'll be writing too.

Okay.

Mmm, nice.

Nice, nice, nice.

So fucking stupid.

So fucking stupid.

You fucking idiot.

What a fucking idiot.

Ruben:

Parent: Yeah!

I feel a little bit old today.

You are old.

I love your name sign, "Ruben."

That first day you were here...

You reminded me of an owl.

Joe: Owl.

And you've become very important to a lot of people around here.

You know? It's true.

Thank you.

I'd like to offer you...

A way that maybe you can continue on here with us.

I imagine you're starting to think about the future a little bit?

- Future?

- Future.

I know I am.

But, uh, I do think there's a way you could maybe stay and work here...

Uh, maybe with my program.

Maybe...

With the kids at school.

Maybe both.

Anyway...

You, uh, think about it, you know?

What the fuck?

Ruben: Her?

Yeah.

Heh, yeah. Cute.

What do you think, huh?

Yo, what do you think?

This?

All?

Yeah.

Whoa, whoa. Wait, yo, it's easy.

It's easy. Just slowly.

Yo. It's for her, huh?

It's for her. We need money.

We need money.

Huh? It's for us.

I'm leveling with you.

Tt's for her.

Yo. For this...

For this, remember, it's, uh...

It's cash, okay? Not check.

Cool. Yo, you okay?

Sure?

Hi, is that prince audiology?

Can you hear me?

It's stone. Ruben stone.

R-u-b-e-n.

Stone. S-t-0o-n-e.

I'm confirming an appointment.

Yeah, I can hold.

- Man: So, listen...

- What did you say?

- Write it down.

- Yeah.

I can't hear you. Write it down.

I got a proposition for you.

What's that?

What if I give it to you at this price?

But on one condition.

I have the option of coming back to you within eight weeks.

Okay?

I get to buy it back off you for 10 percent more than this.

Everything has to be in its current condition.

Everything has to be exactly like it is now.

Hmm? What do you think?

- Why would you wanna do that?

- I can't hear you. I'm deaf.

So it's take it or leave it.

What's it gonna be?

Okay?

You're back.

Come on. Have a seat here.

Um...

I did the deed.

The deed?

Surgery.

How'd you get the money?

I sold my rv and other shit.

- Okay.

- Look, Joe.

I really don't wanna explain myself right now, okay?

It's time, okay?

It's time.

We gotta do something.

Right?

Try and save my fucking life.

So that's what I'm doing, okay?

No one else is gonna save my life. Right?

If I ust sit here and diddle around, what am I gonna have? Nothing.

Okay?

And all this shit, what does it matter?

What does it matter?

It ust passes.

Yo, if I disappear, like, who cares?

Nobody cares, man. Seriously.

Yo, and that's okay.

That's life.

That's life.

No, for real, okay?

It ust passes. It ust fucking...

Fucking passes.

I wonder, uh...

All these mornings you've been sitting in my study.

Sitting.

Have you had any...

Moments of stillness?

Because you're right, Ruben.

The world does keep moving, and it can be a...

Damn cruel place.

But for me...

Those moments of stillness, that place, that's the kingdom of god.

And that place...

Will never abandon you.

But...

Yeah.

And I sincerely hope...

That it brings you happiness, Ruben.

You know what I was wondering?

I don't know if it's possible...

But, uh,

I need money to...

Just to buy back my rv, you know?

You know, me and Lou, it's where we live.

It's our home.

You know?

And I can totally pay you back.

Just, um, now I've got an issue with time.

Ruben...

I don't understand the situation that you put yourself in...

But from where I'm sitting...

You look and sound like an addict.

No, no. Yo, no.

I'm not. It's not a...

I'm not an...

It's fine, okay?

My situation, it's cool, okay?

Seriously, my girlfriend's dad is rich.

He'll give me the money, okay?

This is nothing. You can't imagine how nothing this is.

Seriously.

Okay?

I'm fucking stupid.

I'm sorry to ask.

I'm sorry, okay?

Okay.

I'm ust gonna stay ust...

Three or four weeks until they... activate.

Ruben...

As you know, everybody here shares in the belief that being deaf is not a handicap, not something to fix.

It's pretty important around here.

All these kids...

All of us...

Need to be reminded of it...

Every day.

And my house is a house built on that belief and built on trust.

And when that trust is violated...

Things happen.

And I can't have that.

There are too many others to consider.

And so...

In your current state, at this time...

I'm gonna have to ask you to pack up your bags today...

And find another place to be, Ruben.

Cool.

Audiologist: Are you ready?

Okay.

Here we go.

Can you hear me?

- Say again.

- Can you hear me?

Oh!

How does it sound?

Uh, it sounds weird.

Okay, well, let's try making an adjustment.

How about now? How is that?

Oh, that's bad. It, um...

It's bad.

Do you want to describe what you're hearing?

It's, um...

It's like... high. High.

Um...

Um...

Can you change the...?

Well, I can try and make another adjustment.

How's that?

Okay. Ruben, this is not sound like you remember, and it's the implant in your head that's tricking your brain into thinking you're actually hearing...

When in reality, your ears aren't working still.

So I would suggest that you take it easy for the next few weeks and...

Just...

Get adjusted to how things sound.

Just take your time.

Yeah, hi. Is that, um...?

Is Lou there?

Who is this?

It's... it's Ruben.

It's Ruben.

- Ah.

- Mmm.

Hey.

Bonjour. Uh...

- Ruben.

- Come in.

You are hungry, Ruben?

Yes?

Louise is not here.

Ah, you are hearing?

You are hearing? Yeah.

I... I had an operation.

Wow, yes?

Oh, what is this? What...?

Oh, that's very good. Louise told me your wish for this.

Richard: Oh.

And so, uh...

So you're back to your drums now?

Uh... not yet.

I gotta... I gotta, um...

I gotta deal with some stuff first, you know?

Just gotta...

Gotta settle some things.

Yes. Settle? Like what?

You know, ust, like...

Just getting back into it and also some financial stuff.

- Yes.

- You know, ust gotta figure it out.

Mm-hmm.

Yes. And Louise knows that you're here?

So it's a big surprise.

Well, Louise has been quite busy, you know?

Mm-hmm.

We're doing a party.

So she'll be back home tonight.

That's most certainly.

Oh, you want...?

I'm gonna make you some eggs.

Oh, no. I'm good. Do you need any help with any of this?

No, no.

You need some eggs.

Thanks.

Where did you grow, Ruben?

Where did I grow up? Yes.

Um, like, all over, you know?

Texas, California.

Arizona, Virginia.

Yeah. All over.

Why so many places?

I was, like, uh...

My mom was a nurse in the military.

- Mm-hmm.

- You know, so she'd get moved around.

- And your father too?

- No. I mean, I don't know.

I see.

Uh, I must be honest, I...

Did not always have good feelings for you, Ruben, all these years.

I confide, it is like if one...

Had stolen something precious.

You understand?

But I know it's not you that took Louise from me.

Her mother did that.

She took Louise when she left me.

And she took her again when she killed herself.

And Louise must have come back home then...

But she was hating me so much.

What could I do?

And you, you...

Well, you gave her a place to go... then.

And this is a good thing.

Do you see, I didn't like you much at the time, but now I thank you.

I want to say to you that.

But anyhow, you're gonna be so happy to see how Louise...

Is doing great now.

And that's the most important.

Isn't it?

Hmm? Okay.

Whoa.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Hi.

Can you hear me?

Yeah. Loud and clear.

Oh, look at you, Lulu.

Holy shit.

Look at you, huh?

What? You look different.

Whoa, no scratching, huh?

Oh, yeah.

That's good.

Mwah.

Does it feel weird?

Yeah. Does it look weird?

No.

No, it doesn't.

It looks really neat.

Lou: Mmm.

- So crazy.

- Mm-hmm.

How'd you do it?

Just worked some magic.

I have to talk to you about it.

I had to ust move some things around.

Richard: Louise, tu descends?

Um, did Richard tell you about this party thing tonight?

Oh, shit. Yeah.

Yeah, I have to go, sort some things out.

No, it's great. It's cool. Yeah.

- Go do your thing.

- Okay.

Do you need anything?

No, I'm good.

I'll ust be downstairs.

- Ruben: Hey.

- Lou: Ruben, mon petite ami.

Hi. Hi, what's up?

Woman: Good. How are you?

- Say again?

- How are you?

How are you?

- Did you get some food?

- Huh?

Did you get some food?

- Yeah.

- Yeah? You okay?

- Mm-hmm. You?

- Yeah, yeah.

It's okay.

- Excuse me.

- Okay.

Lou:

Richard: toi  tu souris  et, moi e pleure & toi, tu t'en vas  moi, e demeure  le ciel, est plus pur  la bas, vers I'ailleurs  s'effacent, les couleurs  entre quatre murs  cet amour si fou  que tu, n'as pas connu  cet amour me tue 

+ encore, mon amour  e suis mort 

Richard & Lou: toi, tu souris  et, moi e pleure & toi, tu t'en vas  moi, e demeure  le ciel, est plus pur  la bas, vers I'ailleurs  s'effacent, les couleurs  entre quatre murs  cet amour si fou  que tu, n'as pas connu  cet amour me tue 

+ encore, mon amour  e suis mort 

Hey.

Are you okay?

- Hmm?

- Yeah.

Um, sorry.

I ust need some water. Ahem.

Are you okay?

Mm-hmm. Yeah?

Yeah, it's ust a little dry in here.

Hey, that was, uh...

That was pretty cool tonight.

- You sounded fucking great.

- Yeah, right.

What, you're telling me you weren't feeling it?

- You were in it.

- Well, yeah.

Straight up. You sounded amazing singing that.

That's my dad's stuff, but...

- And you're speaking French now.

- Oh, my god. Barely.

I didn't know you could do that.

Well, I've mostly forgotten, but it's coming back a little.

Yeah, I was thinking, like, do you remember...?

You remember this place at all?

I didn't, but...

It's so disconcerting, the things that your memory holds onto without you knowing.

My mom and I never really talked about this place.

It was always some weird dreamy idea, but...

I mean, now it's come back a little.

Right.

Yeah.

I told everyone about our little gypsy life together.

I miss it.

We gotta get back into it.

You know?

We gotta get back on it.

We gotta get back in the fucking... in the groove, huh?

Don't you think? I gotta go get the airstream sorted.

What do you mean, "sorted"?

I ust got a shit ton of things to do, you know?

Right.

Like, with the tour stuff?

- The tour, everything.

- Yeah.

We ust gotta get back on it.

You know, everything.

The album, the tour.

The... you know?

Yeah.

Hey.

It's okay, Lou.

What?

It's okay.

What's okay?

You saved my life.

You made it...

You made it beautiful.

So it's okay.

What?

Why are you saying this?

You saved my life too, Ruby. gone  into the rain today  wet fields of green

# Minari	     

What is this place?

Our new home.

David, look!

David, don't run.

Look at that! Look!

- Wheels!

- Wheels?

There are wheels.

It's like a big car.

-Hey, kids.

-Yes?

Okay.

Let's go in.

Whoa!

Don't be like that. Come inside.

Come on.

This isn't what you promised.

Grab onto this and step here.

Okay. Whoa.

Okay.

Is that a house?

I don't see any houses.

Over there.

It just gets worse and worse.

-Kids.

-Yes?

Want to see something even better?

Stop it!

How far is the hatchery from here?

Come here.

Look.

Take a look at this.

Look at the dirt.

Look at the color.

This is why I picked this place.

Because of the dirt color?

This is the best dirt in America.

David!

Daddy's going to make a big garden!

Garden is small.

No!

Garden of Eden is big!

Like this!

David, don't run!

You okay?

Where should Grandma's picture go?

We're not staying long.

Leave it in the box.

Is the heart murmur getting louder?

Yeah.

One or two reading are okay.

But we'll keep checking.

We'll move closer to a hospital.

Let's sleep together on the floor for our first night.

No, Dad! You snore!

I want to listen too.

You do?

Put these in your ears.

Don't forget to keep praying.

Back her up.

Nice and slow.

There you go now, nice and slow.

And...

All right, listen up, everyone!

Now this here is Mr. Jacob, and this is Monica Yi.

Mr. Yi is an expert chicken sexer.

He's worked in California and Seattle, so, uh, let's give him a big Arkansas welcome!

This way.

Okay, here we put the males in the blue bin and the females in the white bin.

Okay, go to work.

Hello.

Hello!

There are Koreans here!

A few of us.

David.

Okay.

You read the E volume and I'll read the C volume.

I've never seen anyone as fast as Mr. Yi.

Must've made good money in California.

He did.

But I wasn't fast enough to work there.

How long have you been working?

About six months.

Oh.

In any case, you're fast enough for here.

You came to the right place.

Mom, what can I do?

Go to your sister.

Let's go.

Daddy can take a break.

David, don't run.

What's that?

That?

Male chicks are discarded there.

What is "discarded"?

That's a difficult word, huh?

Hmm...

Male chicks don't taste good.

They can't lay eggs and have no use.

So, you and I should try to be useful.

Okay?

Come here.

Sit down.

Son.

How do you like our farm?

It's good.

How was our land in California?

-We had nothing.

-That's right.

We had nothing.

But now...

We have this big piece of land.

Isn't that good?

Then tell Mommy you really like it.

Okay?

Let's go inside.

The Koreans live in Rogers near three other big towns.

If we move there we could find a Korean grandma to babysit.

There's a big mall, a good school, and people actually live there.

But what about the deal we made?

You can work here and I can build a garden.

You can get five acres in Rogers.

Five acres is a hobby.

But my dream is fifty acres.

That land is your dream?

Anyway, we don't need a babysitter.

There's no one around. What could happen?

But what if something happens to him?

The hospital is an hour away.

That's strange. The sky is green.

Let's give them Mountain Dew.

No! Only water. Okay?

Okay...

The car is ready.

We'll assess the situation before we escape.

Escape? Why?

If the tornado hits, this house will fly away.

Stop staring. Go to the car.

We need to wait here and watch.

Watch what?

The news is tracking the tornado.

Look.

Mom!

See?

It's a "tornado watch," not a "warning."

We worried for no reason.

Are you crazy?

Who's calling who crazy?

Write it big.

Okay.

For you, for our kids!

For our kids? Come on!

I worked for ten years.

Ten years!

Staring at chicken butts all day.

Working myself to the bone!

Living in a tiny home with no money!

And where did that money go?

-Don't start again.

-Start what?

How much money went to the kids?

I'm the eldest son.

I had to take care of my family.

I'm done now. They're all doing well!

Who's doing well? My mother? Us?

Which family are you even talking about?

Enough!

We said we wanted a new start.

This is it.

If this is the "start" you wanted...

Maybe there's no chance for us.

Oh, no.

Well, the mobile home was set up

approximately three weeks ago,

and the owner had yet to tie it down.

When the wind came, it just started rolling.

My favorite. My favorite.

You're up already?

Mmm.

Mom, Anne said we have to move.

Is that true?

Would you live in a house like this when you're married?

I'm going to live here till the day I die.

But are we really moving?

Hmm...

Dad and I talked last night.

We're not moving.

Grandma will come to live with us instead.

Mommy's mom?

Yeah.

She'll finally meet David.

Isn't that nice?

Yes.

I'll be outside.

Okay.

We should get this place ready.

David, eat up.

I'll help you.

Just set it down anywhere.

-Is it down?

Yes.

I'm... I'm thinkin' about water.

I think about water, let the stick do the rest.

I find it every time.

So that's $250 for one good, clean water well and, uh, $300 for two.

$300?

I tell you what then.

Fella before you thought he could save money, too.

You know what happened to him, huh?

No, we don't need.

Let's go back.

Americans...

Believing that nonsense!

David

Korean people use their heads.

Okay?

We use our minds.

Hey, come here.

Come.

Look.

When it rains...

Where will the water go?

High place or low place?

Low place.

That's right.

Where is the low place?

That's right.

Where else?

There?

Okay.

Then which place has lots of water?

There.

Why?'Cause trees like water.

My clever, little boy!

David?

Never pay for anything you can find for free.

For the house, we have to pay for water.

Huh?

But for our farm, we can get free water from the land.

That's how we use our minds.

Got it?

Anne, stay here.

Mom.

Do we have to burn all our trash from now on?

Yes. Isn't the city better?

David.

Did we use that stupid stick?

How did we find this?

We used our minds!

We used our minds!

More! More!

So scary!

-You like them?

-Yes.

Not too big?

They're good.

Now you're a common sense man, Mr. Yi, taking land folks are too scared to buy.

-I admire a thinking man.

Thank you.

Now, let me tell you, with farming these days, you gotta go big or go home, that's just how it is.

It's a good time for it.

Reagan's out to make sure that the farmers are happy.

And I'll be right here to help you.

- Thank you very much.

- You brought your helper.

Would you like a sucker?

I bet you would like the blue one.

- What do you say?

- Thank you.

You're welcome.

If there's something wrong, you can call the owner.

I'm just the one hauling it.

Hey, there.

My name's Paul.

David, introduce yourself.

Say hello.

Okay. Two thousand.

Thank you.

You know, Mr. Yi, if you want,

I drive these things all day.

I drive them in my sleep.

I'm a good worker.

Thank you, but these are Korean vegetables, Korean fruits.

Korean?

I wanna show you something.

You better take a look at this.

Look at this.

This is old money.

It's Korean War money.

Yes, sir. I was there.

It was a hard time.

I'm sure you know.

Here, you wanna take it?

David. What do you say?

You know, it's funny.

The minute I saw you,

I knew we were gonna be friends.

Can I pray?

- Sorry?

- Just wait a minute.

Thank you.

Thank you, God.

Thank you for the Yi family.

Thank you for this divine appointment.

Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

Amen! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

Big things!

You got big things for this family.

Okay.

Mom! Have you looked outside?

How much was it?

It's an investment.

Don't worry. We'll earn it back.

This is how you farm in America.

Why are you laughing?

So, it's not a garden. It's a farm.

Garden, farm, it's all the same.

Just think of it as growing money.

In three years we can quit chicken sexing.

Just leave enough for David.

That's all I'm asking.

Yeah, of course.

What?

You look happy.

Maybe because Mother is coming?

You look prettiest when you're happy.

-Hey, Dad.

-Yeah?

Isn't it better to grow

American vegetables?

Every year, 30,000 Koreans immigrate to the US.

-Wouldn't they miss Korean food?

-Yes!

Then how would a Korean farm like ours do?

-Pretty well, right?

-Yes!

You're shy?

Why don't you want Grandma to come?

It's not earwax, it's dirt.

David...

Mommy's dad died during the war.

You know what that means, right?

That's why Mommy has no brothers or sisters.

Understand?

We're the only family Grandma has.

Can't she come live with us?

Don't touch that. Answer me.

You fight because of Grandma.

If Grandma comes...

Would Mommy and Daddy fight?

My kids are so good-looking!

Stand closer together.

Good!

One, two... Cheese!

Grandma's here.

Wow!

So good-looking!

Grandma's here.

Hello, Grandma!

Oh!

Is this Anne? Already such a lady!

David, say hello to Grandma.

David!

What is this?

Hiding behind your mommy's skirt?

Come on out. It's embarrassing.

Mom.

You're finally here.

You missed me that much?

I really missed you too.

Must've been hard for you to travel so far.

Here.

Chili powder!

Oh my...

Mmm.

It's so hard to get here.

We even drove eight hours to Dallas.

And it wasn't very good.

You brought anchovies too?

You're crying again?

Because of anchovies?

I'm sorry you have to see how our life is now.

Why? Because the house has wheels?

It's fun!

Hold on.

Also...

This...

This is something from me, so take it.

No, Mom. I can't.

Take it!

No, Mom. No!

I should be giving you money.

I'm working now!

Just put it away.

David?

Is he ever going to greet Grandma?

David, come.

Is this the one who looks like me?

Are you curious?

Say it louder.

She doesn't look like a grandma?

Oh! Really?

What a good boy!

I'll give you a present for that compliment!

Let's see.

Here.

You're giving cards to a seven-year-old?

Start him young to beat those other bastards!

No?

Then I'll give you something else!

It's a chestnut!

Looks yummy! Go on and take it.

He's never eaten this before.

Really?

Wait one second.

You don't have to do that for him.

In case it got stale during the plane ride.

Here, eat it!

Take it, David.

-Take it. Take it.

-Eat it. Eat it.

-Take it.

-That's a good boy. Eat it.

Say, "Thank you."

Thank you, Grandma. Hmm?

I heard American kids don't like sharing their rooms.

He's not like that. He's a Korean kid.

You know, you might wanna think about doing something out here.

You know...

What?

You know what an exorcism is?

Yeah.

No. No need.

You know...

What happened out here, it's no good.

Something like that.

Yeah... Real good.

Out!

Out!

Out in the name of Jesus! Out!

Out!

♪ In the name of Jesus

Out! ♪

Okay.

Now things...

Things will grow.

How come you're putting them so close together?

You don't wanna put them so close together like that.

You gotta put them like, further apart, like that.

No. Is that right?

Yeah, this is right.

Otherwise, you just gonna grow tiny little lettuces.

You wanna grow like, grow them up!

No, is here to here.

Shoot, man. We'll grow them the Arkansas way.

You know? You'll be happy.

I'm telling you.

You'll be happy.

♪ You'll be happy

I'll be happy... ♪

Paul.

No, no, no. Get that away from me in the name of Jesus.

In the name of Jesus, get that away. Choo, choo, choo.

You crazy, man.

You... You crazy.

Just don't pass those cigarettes to me.

Okay. Just do it. Okay.

Come on, let's get this soil wet.

-Okay, ready?

Yeah.

Wow. Okay.

That's free water.

-What's in it?

-Anything good for you.

It has everything, even deer antlers.

You must've spent a lot.

David, you're so lucky!

-Is this enough?

-That's good, that's good.

That's good.

Here.

-Try some.

-I don't want it.

Drink it. Grandma brought it from Korea.

That's it!

-I don't want it.

-It's expensive. Drink it all.

Good! Such a good boy!

-Grandma...

-Yeah?

In the future, never, ever bring this again.

Stop, David.

You'll drink one cup every day.

Good job.

Go back!

David, go back to your room!

- Stop!

- David.

David, go to your room.

David, come.

There's a Korea smell!

You've never even been to Korea!

Grandma smells like Korea.

David.

Hey.

What? "Grandma smells?"

Go get the stick.

No?

Then behave in front of Grandma.

Now go to bed.

Go to bed.

What are you making?

Pasta.

Hmm.

Looks tasty. Can Grandma try some?

I want some.

No, this is mine.

Yours is right there.

What's that?

It's water from the mountains.

Dad says it's good for your health.

Then I'll try some.

Grandma?

-Yes?

-You can't cook?

No, I can't.

Can you bake cookies?

No.

Can you bake them?

Then what can you do?

Hmm...

Sucks for you!

Now they're mine!

Out of my way, you bastard!

Watch and learn.

Damn it. Wait.

That's right!

Now, Anne!

Keep playing, keep playing!

Hurry!

A plague on you!

David!

Okay, wait.

Let's see.

Bastard!

Why hasn't anyone started a Korean church here?

Start a church with fifteen Koreans?

It could be nice.

The Korean kids can play together.

The Koreans around here...

Left the cities for a reason.

To escape Korean church.

Ah...

You know, she can't even read.

She isn't like a real grandma.

You like Grandma.

Thank you.

We shouldn't be so far out here.

David.

It's fine! Just a little further.

This would be a great place.

Grandma.

We shouldn't be here because of the snakes.

Do you even know what minari is?

You stupid Americans.

I brought some minari seeds from Korea.

We can plant them right over there.

I'm going down.

David!

The minari will grow well here.

David, come up here now!

I'm telling Mom.

Grandma, stop it!

Fine.

That looks tasty. Eat, David.

You too, Anne.

We should plant some minari.

It'll grow well down by the creek.

I'll think about it.

What's there to think about?

I'll just plant it.

Mom, try some of this.

Mmm.

Hey, David. Bring that mountain water.

That's it.

Good boy. Mmm.

Good boy.

Mmm.

You two used to love this song.

This song?

Hmm.

Sure!

Whenever someone made your mom and dad sing, they'd get all lovey-dovey as they sang this song.

Did we?

They come to America and forget everything.

I love you, darling.

Truly, I love you.

Truly...

I love you.

David, let's pray.

Mommy heard a story about some kids in Korea...

They prayed to see Heaven before bedtime.

And God heard their prayers.

One kid had a weak heart like you.

When he woke up, he was healed!

Why don't you pray to see Heaven too?

You pray, Mommy. You go and see Heaven.

Mommy can't do it.

Only for kids.

Do you want to try?

Hey!

You make this kid do all sorts of crap!

You scared me!

Okay.

Monica.

Practicing on them is pointless.

They're too old.

You're fast enough for Arkansas.

Don't talk to me if you're not going to help.

You must be lonely here without friends.

Even with Mother here, it's not the same thing.

Why are you saying this, all of a sudden?

I thought we might go to church.

David...

Don't hide it, okay?

Something must be broken down there.

What is his thing called in English?

"Penis."

Mommy...

Sometimes, I dream

I'm peeing in the bathroom, but I wake up in my bed.

Then ask yourself before you pee,

"Is this a dream?

Is this a dream?"

And pinch yourself like this!

Hmm? Okay?

Penis-uh broken.

Penis-uh broken.

Mom!

It's not called a penis!

It's called a ding-dong!

Huh?

Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

What a wonderful day to be in the house of the Lord.

If you're here with us for the first time, please stand.

Now, don't be ashamed.

Y'all stand up.

What a beautiful family.

I'm glad you're here.

Okay, you can be seated.

Thank you.

Hi, I'm Monica.

- How long y'all been in town?

Uh...

Where you been hiding?

I'm sorry, my English not so good.

Oh, it's okay, we'll teach you English.

You're just too cute!

Thank you!

- Okay.

- Okay, thank you.

- So cute.

There's another one.

So fat! That man is so fat!

Look at him!

Hey.

Can you stop me if I say something in your language?

Um...

Sure.

Chinga-chinga-chon chama-chama-choo?

Why is your face so flat?

It isn't.

My name is Johnnie.

What's yours?

David.

Nice to meet you, David.

Hey, David.

Blow pomo como lomo?

Oh. Como...

That means aunt in Korean.

That is so neat!

Can I sleep over at his house?

You should sleep at home, with Grandma.

But I don't like Grandma!

Don't say that.

No? Why can't you?

Why?

Broken ding-dong.

Ding-dong broken.

Let's just work on Sundays.

Then why did you give so much money.

Is that Paul?

Paul, what are you doing?

It's, uh... It's Sunday.

This is my church.

Okay.

Do you need a ride?

No, I gotta finish this.

I'll see you Monday.

See you, Paul.

What?

You like Jesus too.

Look at those muscles!

My, my! That's impressive.

Grandma, you're not a real grandma.

What is a real grandma?

They bake cookies! They don't swear!

They don't wear men's underwear!

Really?

Don't do that!

Go get some mountain water.

Let's drink that.

-No.

-No?

Come here.

Pretty boy!

Pretty boy! Pretty...

I'm not pretty!

I'm good-looking!

Oh, my!

He's hitting him again. And again!

Someone could get killed!

It is a dream.

This isn't real.

Good boy!

Good boy! Good boy! Good boy!

Good boy! Good boy.

You little bastard!

Come back here, you little bastard!

Raise your hands!

Keep them apart.

Come on!

Keep them up!

Raise them straight.

That's enough.

Now apologize to Grandma.

Sorry...

You call that an apology?

Do it properly!

She's not even a real grandma...

David!

It's okay, it's okay!

Just don't do it again, okay?

I'll try to be a real grandma from now on.

Okay?

Go get the stick.

Why would you hit him?

Get the stick.

Why would you hit such a sweet boy?

He's only a child!

Who cares if I drank a little pee?

-It was fun!

-Mom!

Go outside and get a new one.

I'll do better. I'll do better.

Mom, it's bad enough you're in this hillbilly place.

Why "hillbilly" place?

It's hillbilly, so David lost all his manners.

Just because you're from the city doesn't make you better.

You two will fight over anything!

Let's see.

My, my!

Such a clever boy.

Good job.

You won.

You're the real winner!

-Paul.

Yeah.

Why is this so dry?

It is dry.

Is that dry over there?

Yeah, it's pretty much dry all over.

This one, too.

There's no water. Bone dry.

We better check that well.

If it's water table well, you won't get much further.

You know, if you wanted, you could try with this.

You could try with these guys.

You ever see one of these guys?

Oh, not there. Not there.

We need to find water somewhere.

If that soil ain't wet, you're gonna lose the crop.

Monica. Will you help me?

-I must've worked too hard.

-Does it hurt a lot?

I can't raise my arms any higher.

I need to wash my hair...

Working outdoors makes me feel alive.

Ow!

Why do you always pinch me like that?

We're losing so much money.

I'm worried.

Everything will be fine.

I'll take care of us.

Coming to this "hillbilly place" was for our family.

And if the farm fails...

You can do what you want.

You could even leave with the kids.

Lean forward.

There's some good stuff out here,

Mr. Jacob Yi.

There's some good stuff out here, Mr. Jacob Yi.

Oh, it's so beautiful.

It's so beautiful,

Mr. Jacob Yi.

I think we better send it to Dallas.

- Paul.

- Yeah?

Good job.

Very good job.

Good job.

Good job.

Okay, that's...

That's enough.

Hello, sir.

Yes, the order is ready.

We'll send it this weekend.

Uh...

But we've already started...

All right.

Paul! Come on!

- What?

Take it back!

- What for?

Put it back.

What happened?

Take it back?

Whoa...

Where are they getting their produce at?

California.

They just change it like that on you?

You know, we still got some time, Jacob.

You know, we'll find someplace else.

It ain't rotting on the vines.

Korean people, big city, you never trust them!

Well, forget...

Just forget about Dallas.

Forget about Dallas.

There's always Oklahoma City.

Or Memphis...

I'm still paying for water!

We'll try and get the...

It's okay.

It's gonna be all right.

I have to go to work, okay?

To go to work.

It's gonna be all right!

Finished already?

Oh.

Someone could get killed.

My, my...

David. David!

David, go change.

It's time to go.

Where?

Church picnic.

Grandma, please help him change.

Who cares what a little boy wears?

Grandma, the water isn't working.

-Your arms still hurt?

-I'm fine.

Just leave it.

If they're injured, we throw them away.

Anne! Grandma!

Anne! Grandma!

What is it?

My goodness!

Hurry! Get a towel!

Anne, snap out of it! Get a towel!

The church bus is here.

You go ahead, without David.

This just gets better and better.

There we go.

Which drawer attacked you?

You lifted that heavy thing?

And you put it back, all by yourself?

Goodness.

Okay. Try standing up.

There you go. Good.

Okay. Okay.

Now, try walking.

Oh, my!

Strong!

Strong boy! Mmm!

Strong boy. Mmm!

What?

No one's ever said that to you?

David. You're a strong boy.

You're the strongest boy

Grandma's ever seen!

-Grandma.

-Yeah?

What does pee taste like?

You rascal!

The weather is nice.

Grandma! You can walk faster like this!

I can?

Goodness. You might as well run.

You do that because you shouldn't run?

You want to run, don't you?

Why don't we try running to that tree together?

I don't think I can.

It's okay, it's okay.

Let's just go.

Slowly.

Let's go slowly.

Careful. Careful.

The minari is growing well!

David, you've never eaten minari before, huh?

Minari is truly the best.

It grows anywhere, like weeds.

So anyone can pick and eat it.

Rich or poor, anyone can enjoy it and be healthy.

Minari can be put in kimchi, put in stew, put in soup.

It can be medicine if you are sick.

Minari is wonderful, wonderful!

♪ Minari, minari, minari

♪ Wonderful, wonderful minari ♪

That's right!

Wonderful, wonderful minari.

Is that a minari song?

The wind is blowing and the minari is bowing.

They're saying thank you very much!

Grandma! Look at that!

Stop. David! Leave it alone!

It might crawl away and hide!

David.

It's better to see it than to have it hide.

Things that hide are more dangerous and scary.

-There's been no water all day?

-Yeah.

I should check the pipes.

He thinks I don't know.

We can't afford more water.

He used it all on the crops.

What are we going to do?

I'm sure we'll borrow more from the bank.

Daddy, where are you going?

I wanna come, too.

No. Go inside.

Mom.

I'll take care of our family.

Don't work too hard.

So, where did you get all that water?

David and I hauled it over from the minari creek.

David is stronger than you think, you know.

He's not supposed to do things like that.

You remember Cousin Doo-won?

That big, dumb kid.

At David's age, he was much weaker.

You don't understand, Mom.

Getting hurt is all part of growing up.

Even the doctors are worried.

His heart could stop at any moment.

What are you doing?

Why aren't you sleeping? What's wrong?

Mommy said if I pray,

I can see Heaven in my sleep.

Like those kids who prayed to see Heaven?

Are you scared?

It's all right.

You don't have to go see Heaven.

Saying such nonsense to a kid.

But... I already prayed.

I already asked to see it.

But now, I don't want to go.

Then David...

Pray this instead.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

"No thank you... Heaven."

But what if I go to Hell?

Why are you worrying about that already?

I don't want to die.

Come here, David.

Grandma won't...

Grandma won't let you die.

Who? Who dares to scare my grandson like this?

Don't worry. Grandma won't let you die.

Who dares?

You'll be fine.

You don't have to see Heaven.

What?

Grandma.

Hmm.

Grandma?

Grandma!

Grandma, why did you wet the bed?

Why is she like that?

We'll call Mom from church.

Get dressed.

When Jesus comes again, what a glorious day that's gonna be.

But what are you gonna say when He asks...

I'm going to go call Mom, okay?

Okay.

...Sue from the bank...

Excuse me.

...why is Earl from the grocery store not with us?

Why didn't you preach the good news of salvation to those precious people?

David...

Mom took Grandma to the hospital.

When will they come home?

I don't know.

There's that cross guy.

You think he saw?

I heard he got dirt floors and he shits in a bucket.

He got no water where he lives.

Was church good?

Yes.

-There's no water?

-Not yet.

That's not good...

I can get more from the minari creek.

Oh.

Stay with your friends tonight, but be careful.

We will.

How's Grandma?

Mom said we could stay with friends.

Really?

My mom's friend keeps this here.

He don't mind.

Wanna try some?

Does it hurt?

Put it like this.

It only hurts if you eat it.

So don't eat it, stupid!

I'm a cowboy!

You won't get points that way.

Get a junk card.

You'll get more money.

- This one?

- Yeah!

Out of my way, you bastard!

This is a great game.

Yeah.

All right, boys, breakfast is right here.

There you go.

Come here, boo. Give me a hug.

Come on over here.

Come here.

Get over here. Let me look at you. You sleep good?

That's your buddy, huh?

Hey, it's good to meet you.

Go on, eat your breakfast.

How's your daddy like that new farm?

Hmm?

Good.

He growing things good, doing things right?

Yes.

That's good.

I knew the fella who was there before.

- Who?

- Bucky Reed.

He went flat broke.

Boom.

I guess it's what a man does.

You tell your mom I was here all night.

Okay.

And you help your dad on that farm. All right?

You hear me?

All right, Johnnie,

I'll see you in a little while, all right?

I'm going to work.

Grandma...

What are you looking at, Grandma?

Leave it...

It will hide...will hide.

Anne, come over here.

What's wrong with Grandma?

Grandma had a stroke, she needs to rest.

Why did it happen?

It's my fault.

This happened because I was selfish.

Grandma will be okay, Mom.

My daughter's so grown-up.

Worrying about her mom.

Always looking after her brother, too.

I'm sorry.

I won't let this happen again.

Mom wants to go back to California because of Grandma.

When?

First, they're going to check your heart, and then decide.

Would you rather live with Mom or Dad?

I don't know.

Me neither.

David. David.

Paul.

Oh. Thank you so much.

David, help Grandma.

David

I told you to help Grandma.

Here, Mom.

For... David... Him...him.

Hmm.

Oh, sorry.

But don't put that kimchi too far away. I like it.

Oh!

It made me sweat on my head.

- You know?

- You okay?

I'm good.

You're our first guest here.

I'm honored.

Hmm.

Hmm.

I'm gonna put some oil in here.

Paul, she sees something here.

- Right here?

- Yeah, yeah.

Look out.

Look out, it's gonna...

Cast you out!

Cast you out!

Cast you out!

Hear our prayer, oh, Heavenly Father.

Hear this prayer. Come down,

Jesus, to me, oh, Lord.

Only you can heal.

Only you can heal her.

It feels different, doesn't it?

Mmm, yeah.

It feels like, lighter.

Yes, yes.

I feel light.

Ah!

Thank you. Thank you, Paul.

Thank you so much.

Thank you.

Uh, wait here.

I have something here. Yeah.

Okay.

Hey.

Do you...

Do you want me to...

To pray for you and...

If you want.

Why?

No need.

I meant...

Come early tomorrow, okay?

Lot of work.

You said he was strange, now you ask him to do this?

When did I say that?

He wanted to help us.

We should be grateful.

What did you tell him about us?

Why would I tell him anything?

It's your fault, Grandma.

It's all because of you.

You shouldn't have come to America.

108 degrees today,

which beats the record all to smithereens.

It was 101 set way on back in the 50s.

Let's take a look right now at the full heat wave.

There it is,

17 days' worth. And...

Mom, look over here.

There's food in the fridge.

No need to heat it up, okay?

It's okay. You don't have to help.

Watch TV and rest. We'll be home late.

Mmm-hmm.

Don't worry.

Thank you so much, Mom.

We'll be back.

Hmm.

You're good. This one's good.

-This one's good.

Okay.

They're all good.

Wait, wait, wait.

Okay, just one more thing.

It's good. What do you think they're gonna say when they see that?

Jacob.

This good.

Okay, this good.

It's good. Yes.

Hey.

They won't say no.

They won't say no.

Okay. Okay.

I love these.

It's a very exciting move.

It's a very important move.

Jacob...

- O... Okay.

- Yes!

You're bringing that inside?

It's too hot out here.

Where will you put it?

Okay.

I'll park downstairs. Go ahead.

We're here for David.

Okay. Go on in.

Thank you.

All right.

All right, buddy.

You can sit up, get dressed, and go wait in the waiting room.

How's that sound?

- Good. Thank you.

- Thank you.

Is he okay?

We don't know.

The doctor will tell us.

Here we go. Good job!

Life was so difficult in Korea.

Remember what we said when we got married?

That we'd go to America and save each other.

I remember.

Instead of saving each other all we did was fight.

Is that why he's sick?

Jacob.

Can't you come with us?

I can't do this without you.

You're the one who wants to leave.

We'll go broke living here.

In California, we could easily pay off our debt.

By chicken sexing until we die.

Think about the kids.

They need to see me succeed at something for once.

For what?

Isn't it more important that we stay together?

You go ahead and do what you want.

Even if I fail,

I have to finish what I started.

Mr. and Mrs. Yi?

Ready to see you now.

Kids. Let's go.

Okay, see, this is where blood flows out, like a door.

Open, close, open, close.

You see how close the hole is here?

Now this is why the California doctor wanted to wait till he's a bit older before surgery.

But, and are you ready?

It looks like the hole is getting smaller.

- What?

- It's still there, but in comparing measurements, it's a significant improvement.

All right, this means we can rule out surgery, and we can see if the hole closes up on its own.

This is very good news.

But sound has gotten louder.

Yes. Sometimes, as the hole gets smaller, the sound gets louder.

Loud is good.

Are we happy?

Yes, I'm happy.

Thank you.

Good job!

Must be the Ozark water.

Whatever it is you're doing, don't change a thing.

Good!

Look, it's kimbap!

Hey, what are these?

I'm guessing some kind of...

Beans?

Or maybe it's seeds.

It kind of looks like peanuts.

-Anne, don't touch it.

-Okay.

Kinda looks like peanuts chopped in half.

Yeah.

It's a very good idea.

Many Koreans are moving to Oklahoma City.

Yes, and most of your produce comes from California.

It arrives in worse shape and doesn't taste as good.

We're only five hours away.

Very good.

Then...

When should we start?

Let's start next week.

Okay.

Thank you.

Please keep these as samples.

Oh.

Thank you very much!

Thank you!

Have a good day.

Did you see?

They have so many Korean foods.

This is such perfect timing.

The owner said so himself.

Mom must be in shock. She's speechless.

Anne, take David to the car.

Monica.

Monica.

What is it?

You're really asking because you don't know?

At the hospital...

You chose the farm over our family.

It's different now.

Everything worked out.

We can live together when things are good, but when they're not, we fall apart?

Let's just stop, okay?

Now, we can make money and live without worries.

So, you're saying...

We can't save each other, but money can?

But Jacob...

Things might be fine now.

But I don't think they will stay that way.

I know this won't end well and I can't bear it.

I've lost my faith in you.

I can't do this anymore.

Okay.

It's done.

You haven't left yet?

We're heading out now.

I'll see you next week.

What's that smell?

It smells like smoke.

Jacob...

Stay in the car!

Stay in the car!

Jacob!

-Grandma!

-Grandma!

Mom, are you okay?

What happened?

Mom!

Jacob!

Mom!

Jacob!

Honey!

Get out! Get out of here!

Mom!

Dad!

Dad! Dad!

Grandma!

You stay here, okay?

Grandma!

Honey!

Honey!

Honey!

Grandma!

Grandma!

Grandma, where are you going?

-Grandma!

-Grandma!

Grandma!

Grandma!

Grandma!

Grandma!

Grandma!

Grandma, this is the wrong way.

Grandma.

Our house is back there.

Grandma!

Please don't leave, Grandma.

Come home with us.

Yeah. Mark it.

That be where it is.

It's growing well on its own.

David.

Grandma picked a good spot.

Looks tasty.

Here, David.

DRIVER: But there was something strange though, because a few months later, we were looking through our wedding photographs and there was a picture of myself and my wife at the front of the hotel.

And you could see just behind us, a figure of someone looking out of the window.

Staring at us.

Really quite scary at the time.

-Nobody you could account for?

-Absolutely nobody.

-Oh, my goodness.

-And it turns out the room

-was empty at the time.

-[gasps]

DRIVER: So, I, uh...

I avoid the place on dark winter nights. [chuckles]

[bell tolling]

Mum, we're here.

We've arrived.

[dog panting]

[quick sigh]

[computer keyboard clicking]

WOMAN: Good evening.

We'd like to check in please.

Yeah, no problem.

-Uh, do you have a reservation?

-Yes.

-Great. What's the name?

-Hart.

Hart.

[turning pages]

RECEPTIONIST:   mm.

When did you book?

I was gonna say that I... made the reservation um, several months ago.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I understand that.

I'm just-- I'm just looking.

Just... [sighs]

-Several months ago you said?

-Yeah.

-But I did ring last week...

-You did ring?

-Okay.

-...to double check.

-Ah, here you go.

-Yes.

-Uh, Julie Hart, ground floor.

-That's right.

-No. Well, no, uh...

-With wheelchair access.

In fact, when I rang last week it was to confirm that what we-- what we've reserved is the first floor, uh, facing the formal gardens.

Uh, no. There's nothing here on my side.

Usually when people book and they have a special request

-it's attached to the booking.

-Uh-huh. Yes.

Well, I imagine he would have made a note of it.

Can you check with your colleague maybe?

He's not here this evening.

Or, maybe even your manager.

-It's just me for tonight.

-[typing]

But we're here tonight and I reserved it.

Yeah, I get that.

So, would you be happy to stay on the ground floor just for tonight?

No, I'm afraid not, because

I reserved a first floor room.

Well I can't put you in a room that I haven't got.

[continues typing]

A lot of keys there.

Just one moment, please.

I mean...

I have one room that I can give you just for tonight.

-Oh.

-That is on the first floor.

JULIE: Oh.

Oh, that's very good. Um...

Well, maybe could I see that room?

Yeah, you wanna see the room?

-Yes. Just check it out.

-I'll take you up.

And there's Wi-Fi throughout the hotel, is there?

Uh, no, not throughout the hotel.

If you want some signal, best off going to the top of the building.

JULIE: I'm sorry,

I didn't understand.

Did you say that there was Wi-Fi on this floor?

RECEPTIONIST: I mean, there is Wi-Fi in the building, but you only get signal when you go up to the top.

JULIE: I did reserve a table in the restaurant for dinner.

RECEPTIONIST:   h, no, you were late so everything's closed.

-And here's your key. Thanks.

-Thank you.

And as soon as possible it would be good to know that we can be here for the remaining nights.

[door shuts]

Oh, God!

Getting our things in a little bit of a muddle here.

Just get it all.

Here we are. Oops.

Now, no peeking.

[laughs] No, I'm not looking.

I'm not looking.

[drawer shuts]

Darling, don't you want to take your coat off?

You must be boiling.

I just want to get everything organized.

MOTHER:

Oh, it's so good to be here.

I remember the ceiling.

[Julie zips luggage]

And I think, uh,

I was in that bed.

My sister was in this one.

Look...

Oh, darling. Oh, no!

[chuckles]

Oh, my Lord...

All right, Mum. So, I'll see if I can find a kettle.

-All right, darling.

Louis, you stay here.

Stay with your mistress.

I won't be long.

-Good morning.

-Good morning.

-Just one or two things.

-Yeah?

I'm wondering if there's any clarity on whether or not we can stay in our room for the next few nights.

Um, I still don't know about the room.

Oh, there's no way of expediting that decision is there?

Uh, no. I can try and get back to you later on today, but I can't promise anything.

Sooner rather than later would be much appreciated.

Yep.

Also, we don't seem to have a kettle in our room.

-An electric kettle, please.

-Yep, I'll bring one up.

And, also, I had a very unsettled night.

There was a sound.

I'm sure other people have mentioned it to you.

A banging of some kind.

I imagine it was a window or...

Yeah. I mean, there's no one staying above you.

Well, exactly.

I can't imagine anybody would have been staying in a room with that because they wouldn't have been able to sleep at all.

It was... And I don't know if it was a window, but it felt repetitive and...

Yeah, all night.

That's strange,

'cause nobody else has mentioned anything at all about any noise whatsoever.

-Really?

-Yeah.

That does surprise me.

It was pervasive.

Oh, well, anyway, um...

I would be very grateful if you could make sure that doesn't happen again tonight, and check all the windows and...

All the windows?

Well, all the windows--

Especially in the rooms that are not occupied, because, obviously, the people who are staying in the rooms will be able to check their own windows.

Yep.

I also have a message for you, by the way.

Your cousin...

Alistair.

He wants you to go to lunch with him on Sunday.

Oh, thank you very much.

So, lovely to hear that we can stay in our room.

The checking of the windows...

...and, uh, and the kettle.

-Yeah, I'll bring the kettle up.

-Thank you.

-No problem.

-Thank you.

We don't want to go do we?

Just tell me, what would you prefer?

Well, what do you feel?

No, Mum.

I want us to do what you want.

Oh, well I feel so awful to say it, but...

It's not that I don't want to see them, but I mean, we're so cozy here, aren't we?

Yeah, I mean it's very selfish, but I was rather hoping...

...we could be together.

If you can think of a nice way of saying it,

I think it would be really wonderful

-if we could just be us.

-Very good. I'll call him later.

I think that would be...

I think that would be the best.

You having a nice breakfast?

Very, very good marmalade.

So I'm gonna go and make a start on my work.

Are you all right?

I'm perfectly fine, thank you, darling.

I'm just gonna take my time and then I'm gonna have a bath.

Do you want me to run it for you?

-Mm.

-Really?

No, don't worry. I'll be fine.

You found a nice place to work?

Yeah, yeah, I think so.

I'm gonna give it a stab anyway.

RECEPTIONIST:

It's not a problem...

I'm just... in the middle of something.

Yeah.

[pencil scratching]

[door creaks, thuds]

[wind blowing outside]

[faint moaning]

Mum?

Mum?

[hotel creaking]

I got you a nice glass of wine.

MOTHER: Thank you very much.

Oh, goodness me.

Are we early or late?

I mean...

Are we the only people staying here?

Have you worked that out yet?

I know... I don't know. I...

There was no-one here when I arrived.

Oh, look at that.

Thank you very much.

That's very welcome.

Are you ready to order?

Oh, I do apologize.

Haven't even had a look.

Uh, not quite,

I just, uh... gosh.

Shall I come back in a couple of minutes or...

JULIE: That would be kind.

RECEPTIONIST:   'll come back in a couple of minutes.

Thank you.

Ooh... Nice looking things.

What do you think, Mum?

What do you think?

I'm, um... I'm a bit torn between the soup...

A carrot and coriander soup, and the beetroot salad sounds very nice.

Yeah, "Salad of heritage beetroot, apple and Welsh feta."

Such... So nice when it's local.

I mean, I suppose we could have...

...different things on different nights.

RECEPTIONIST:

Have you decided?

There's only four options.

I think I'll have the, um...

Yeah, I think I'll have the beetroot salad to start.

-And then, uh...

-A main?

Yes and then followed by the salmon.

-[pen scribbling]

-Yeah.

MOTHER: And I'll have the same, please.

The beetroot salad...

...and the salmon.

-I'll bring it over.

-JULIE: Thank you.

[camera whirs]

MOTHER: Darling, will you stop doing that?

You must, must have enough photographs of me by now.

-JULIE: Well, I gotcha.

-[sighs]

So there.

[flatware clinking]

What's in that bag, Mum?

Oh, just...

...things to go through.

Letters and, um... and papers and photographs and, uh...

Maybe there's... stuff in it that... that I would...

...value... that maybe you wouldn't.

Well, I'm sure you're very interested.

I can...

I can sense your interest.

I'm sure you think you're going to want to put it in a film at some point.

Let's just have a nice dinner.

-[bell tolling]

-Do you remember this room?

Yes, this was-- this was the drawing room.

And, uh... big, big sofas here.

Velvet ones.

Yeah.

And us children would jump off the back of it.

We would jump from one to the other.

See if we could make it.

Over a dog preferably.

Mm...

Did you have a good day, darling?

Not great actually. Um...

Couldn't really get started.

I mean, I didn't sleep... for a start and, uh...

I dunno. I'm, I'm...

I don't know,

I feel a little unsettled.

Nice to hear your voice.

Oh, I'm-- I'm so sorry.

I couldn't get a message to you either.

Um... But, uh...

Oh, I mean, I don't know,

I started, you know.

-I found a nice room and I...

-[dog whimpering]

...sat and looked out the window. [laughs]

It'll, you know, it'll come, I suppose.

But, uh, it...

Oh, hang on, what's that...

Hello? Hello?

Oh, that's a bit better.

Yeah, I'm just gonna stand by this bit of leaf.

Um...

Oh, hello?

Hello? Hello?

Hello?

[sighs] Oh, God.

Lou? There we are.

Isn't it?

Aren't we having a lovely time?

Do you want to go out?

[lamp buzzing fitfully]

[door opens]

[Louis whimpers]

Okay. Okay.

There's a good boy. Go on.

Go on, you told me you wanted to come out.

Come on, come on.

Come on, do a pee.

[sighing]

Don't you want to do a pee?

[breeze picking up]

Louis...

-Come on, do something.

-[Louis whimpers]

What were you saying to me?

You said you wanted to come out.

Huh? What is it?

Don't you want to do...

Oh, come on.

JULIE: Hello?

[bell tolls]

[footsteps approaching]

JULIE: I'm, I'm sorry.

We didn't mean to disturb you.

MAN: It's quite all right.

I hope you and your mother are having a very pleasant and comfortable stay.

We are, yes. Thank you.

Very much so.

-Good night.

-Good night.

-[Louis whimpers sharply]

-Come on...

[footsteps approaching]

JULIE: There we are.

Oh, darling, thank you so much.

You're an angel.

I feel terrible taking you away from your work like this.

Oh, no. I'll do it later.

This is a nice job.

Well, it's a great help.

I mean, I have a pile and

I really want to get them away as soon as possible.

Maybe after lunch we could post them.

Do you want to take one of my little helpers?

I don't want to get dependent on anything, so...

I-- I understand, but just-- just say the word.

I have them you know, and I find they're marvelous.

They just--

You know, I go straight off.

No, I'll go for a longer walk today and I don't know... maybe drink less coffee.

I don't know. Anyway...

All right, so I've done the Asbury's.

I've done Anne and

Michael Saxton-Thomas.

Um... uh...

Oh, uh, yes, Charles Stowe.

Did I tell you that Molly died?

So sad.

He was so sweet when, you know, when he wrote me such a lovely letter.

All right, uh, let's get on with that.

With an "E" and "Esquire."

And you'll find the address in there.

So nice by the fire.

Do you remember this room?

Was it like this when you were here before?

Uh, do you know,

I was just thinking.

I remember the fireplace very well. Um...

I remember being rather frightened of it actually, uh, when I was...

Yeah, I mean, it's so funny isn't it, to think that one would be frightened, but I...

Although, I have happy memories of this room.

Um, I think, uh, you know,

Aunt Jocelyn was, um...

...always filling it with children.

And, uh, didn't have any of her own, but she, you know, she took us in and she took the cousins, and yeah...

Happy times.

And... I mean, did you, did you--

Were you aware of the war going on?

Did you have bombers going over or...?

Yeah... Well, I mean, you're not far from Liverpool here, so yeah there-- [exhales] there were...

Darling, let's get on with these cards.

-I mean, I--

-All right.

Can we? Do you mind?

Let's-- I'm--

The truth is I feel a bit wobbly today, so I just--

Oh, Mum!

No, just I dunno,

I just feel a bit sort of cold, even though we're by the fire.

You look a bit cold.

Oh, would you like a scarf?

-I'll go and get you a scarf.

-No, well don't--

-Yeah. No, easy.

-I can do it darling.

-I'll get one later.

-No, no, no, I'll get it.

-She's such a fusspot.

-[affectionate whine]

Isn't she?

[receptionist humming melody]

[bell tolling]

[flatware clinking]

Is your room nice, where you've found to write?

JULIE: Mm.

Didn't get any work done today.

Maybe it'll just take a little time.

MOTHER: This was, um...

This is a room

I remember very well.

Um... it was a drawing room.

[clears throat]

And, uh...

It was hung with tapestries.

I mean, real tapestries, not what they have now but, um...

And, uh...

It had a needlepoint fireguard, which my Aunt Joss had made.

We had it for a while.

-I don't know where it is now.

-[footsteps approaching]

The telephone was in this room, and my aunt...

There was this one day when my aunt, um...

-[kicks plastic bag]

-There's a bag on the floor.

-Finished?

-Um... yeah. Yeah, okay.

-I'll bring in the main.

-Thank you.

Um...

And I remember her voice, particularly.

Very low.

Oh, my cousins and I were mucking about on the stairs, and... and she came out of the room and made an absolute beeline for me, with this very serious look on her face.

Which was rare, 'cause she was a very merry soul generally.

Um...

-Mm.

-[faint creaking]

And there'd been this...

...news about Peter.

His, uh, plane had been lost over the English Channel.

Yeah. And, um...

Mummy and Daddy had the funeral in London and they thought it best that we stay here with Aunt Joss, which we did. Um...

We went to the beach.

And my brothers, my... my older brothers... they went.

They were old enough to go.

Mum, I'm so sorry.

Oh, darling, no.

I didn't know.

I feel so bad for bringing you here.

That's what rooms do.

They, they hold these stories and...

We're here now.

And that was then.

And, and there's just this muddle in me, of when-- when it is, exactly.

-That's all.

-Well you always said you had such happy memories here and that's why I thought...

Oh, darling I did--

I did have happy memories here.

But I also had other memories here.

I had all sorts of memories here.

-And they, they...

-[footsteps approaching]

You know, they're all still alive.

-[sets down plate]

-Battered cod.

Kitchen's closing soon.

Thank you.

That's quite a helping.

Could you help me with this?

I'm not sure that I could manage all of that.

[laughing] Oh, no, Mum!

Look how much I've got.

Just leave it if you can't eat it.

I don't see a fish knife, either.

Yeah, I don't know which one we're supposed to use.

[quietly]

All right, let's see...

[cutting food]

-I feel so bad.

-For what, my darling?

To bring you back to a place which you have such sad memories about. I mean...

I'm-- I'm really sorry.

I wanted to come.

I'm so grateful to you for bringing me.

This is a-- this is a lovely thing for us to be here together.

JULIE: I... I...

I feel really bad for coming now.

It's not your fault.

Mum, I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

[voice trembling]

I'm so sorry.

[cutlery clicking]

Nothing's your fault.

[Julie stifles sob]

Mmm.

[Julie sniffles]

[crying]

MOTHER: I don't know.

I mean, it's not like any of us could have done anything to stop it.

So you just have to take it, don't you?

You know, you can't regret it because you didn't have any say in it.

[voice shaking] Mm.

I mean, that's what life's like.

Just...

You know, you roll with the punches.

[muffled techno music thumping]

RECEPTIONIST: Why haven't you been answering your phone?

[footfalls on drive]

Why haven't you been answering--

Alfie!

What's wrong with you?

Why you driving off?!

What is wrong with you?

What is wrong with you?

[car revving]

[light thump]

Oh, there you are. I'm so sorry.

It's even later this time.

Um... how are you?

Yeah, sorry, it's not very good.

Let me just go over here.

I think it's kind of best up against the hedge.

[light chuckle]

Oh, oh, um...

Oh, I don't know, I'm actually having a kind of bad day.

I'm having doubts about the whole project.

[Louis whimpers]

I don't know,

I just feel so guilty.

[sighs]

I can't really explain it.

I mean, it's got something to do with being here, but...

[sighs]

Oh, anyway, I...

Darling, you know, it's actually really cold out here.

I think I'm gonna have to go in and get Louis in.

So, uh, I'll call you tomorrow when I can, okay?

I hope it'll be earlier.

What? Hello?

[wind blowing]

[faint thumping outside]

Are you all right, darling?

I'm fine, Mum. I won't be long.

You've been an awful long time.

[pill box rattling]

[Louis panting lightly]

-[exhales]

-[Louis whimpers]

Yes, my boy.

[sighs]

[window rattling]

[hinges creaking]

[Louis whimpers]

[light whimper]

Louis?

Louis! Louis?

-Louis!

-[distant animal calling]

Louis! Louis?

[wind moaning]

Louis!

Louis!

Louis!

[bell tolling]

Louis! Louis?

MAN: Are you all right?

JULIE: Oh! I'm so sorry.

My-- my mother's dog.

He's vanished. I don't know where he's gone.

MAN:

I'm sure he's not far away.

JULIE: Louis!

[bell continues tolling]

JULIE: Louis!

-Here, boy!

-Louis!

JULIE: Come Louis! Come!

Louis?

[croaking bird call]

Louis?

[gravel crunching underfoot]

Louis?

-[gasps] Oh! Oh.

-[whimpers]

[quietly] Now, you stay there.

Stay. Don't move.

[lamps buzzing fitfully]

I wanted to tell you, he's found!

-[Julie laughs]

-Oh, good!

And to thank you so much for your help.

You're most welcome.

No, I feel awful for having involved you.

Oh, it's perfectly all right.

So grateful. Thank you.

Well, we should celebrate.

Why don't you have a seat?

Well if... if I'm not disturbing you.

-No.

-That would be lovely.

-Thank you.

-I'll be with you in a moment.

Thank you.

I'm so sorry.

Don't be.

He's back. He's safe.

-[sniffs] Yeah.

-Cheers.

[laughs] Cheers.

-[chuckles]

-I'm Julie.

I'm Bill.

-William...

-Yes.

Was my father's name.

-Ah...

-Mm.

-He's no longer with us?

-No.

He, um... he died a couple of years ago.

Oh, I'm sorry.

My wife died about a year ago.

-Oh, I'm so sorry.

-She worked here.

-She was the chef.

-Oh.

We had about thirty some years working in this place together.

And, um...

I could have retired, but I decided to stay on.

Pretty much because of my wife.

And the memories that we have of working here.

You might have heard me playing the flute.

Um... something that I picked up shortly after she died.

And so I sit in the office or in the kitchen and I play for her.

Because I never played for her before.

And, um, so it's like a new chapter in our relationship.

And what do you do?

-I'm a filmmaker and I came...

-Ahh.

I came here, um, with my mother to, um...

...to try and write a film about my mother and I.

Ah.

But not easy.

Uh... I-- I can't even get started.

[murmurs]

Why is that?

[exhales]

I...

I think I'm not sure I feel

I have a right...

...to do such a thing.

It feels like trespassing.

It's really difficult for me to think of her being sad.

You know,

I want her to be happy.

I just want her to be happy all the time.

There are memories here that I...

...um, have with my wife that are not happy.

Um...

I make my rounds.

And, of course... that's the time when memories flood back to me.

And I make my rounds quietly in the evening.

Through the building and on the grounds.

And I suppose it is a way of staying in touch with my wife.

So I can understand you wanting to make a film about your mother to...

...keep that sense of that relationship with her.

It's difficult, isn't it?

And I really am so very, very grateful to you

-for all your kindness.

-Oh, you're most welcome.

You've really been a great, great help.

I wonder, tomorrow, before my mother's birthday dinner, we're, we're going to have a drink to toast her, and I wondered if you'd like to join us?

Oh, that's awfully kind of you, but I have family business, so I won't be around tomorrow evening.

-But thank you so much.

-Not at all, I just...

-It was a thought. [chuckles]

-Good night.

-Good night.

-Rest well.

Thank you.

[Louis whimpers]

There was a time when, uh... when... when we hoped that-- that they might, uh...

But, uh, but no.

-And now she has her work.

-Mm.

And she makes her films, and they are...

...as time consuming, uh, and as energy consuming

I would suggest, as a... as a child might be.

-Oh, yes. Mm.

-Each one as they come along.

-Yes.

-Um... Yeah, I mean, uh...

I'm... I'm sad for her that she doesn't have a child, because I think she would have... uh...

I was going to say she would have been a wonderful mother, but the truth is, she is a wonderful mother.

-Mm.

-She has a great capacity for...

...practical, the practical magic of love.

-Yes.

-You know, she does it well.

-Yes.

-And I'm, these days, very much the recipient.

Well, I've always been the recipient.

-[Bill laughs]

-But particularly now that, uh, that her father's left us.

She's, um... diligent to a degree.

-BILL: And looks up to you.

-Yes, she really does.

Oh, darling,

I want you to do me a favor, and if you see me nod off,

I want you to give me a nudge.

Don't you want to go to sleep?

No, I don't want to go to sleep.

Don't you want to have a nice nap?

Oh, I don't know, it's just yesterday, after lunch,

I dropped off and I... it was like this kind of...

Can't really explain it.

Sort of dread.

What kind of dread?

Being here. I mean...

There's no question there are...

[sighs deeply] um... you know...

...all sorts of memories popping up.

It's inevitable I suppose.

You know, even in this room.

So many.

JULIE: What sort of memories?

Well, I mean, you know, the longer we're here, the... the more it comes back.

You know, the times

I've been here.

When, when I...

...came to visit... Aunt Joss.

Not just when I was a child, but later.

What sort of memory?

You know, when I was, um... when I, when I was, uh...

...when I was expecting that baby.

Oh, yes.

I was here.

Oh, Mum. I had no idea.

Yeah, well, no, I mean, you know, how could you darling?

But, uh, I mean, I...

...virtually forgotten it myself.

But, you know, I was thinking, you know, it was...

It was around about this time of year.

And, um...

[wind moaning softly]

Yeah, I mean...

[inhales through teeth]

And I was in this room.

And we'd been for a walk.

Too long... I think.

Yeah. And, um...

And I started to bleed.

Oh.

I was here without Daddy, but then...

I was taken to hospital, and, um... when he came there... the thing I can't stop thinking about was I wasn't very nice to him.

Oh, Mum.

I mean, in the circumstances...

I was really quite horrid, actually.

Daddy would have understood.

He would have understood.

Mum?

Mum?

[knock on door]

-Hello?

-Hi. Your cousin's downstairs.

-Alistair.

-He's here?

-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

-Mum, Alistair's here.

[chuckling] Darling!

Didn't you call him back?

Oh, well, uh... oh, that's a surprise.

Could you-- could you tell him that I'll be down in a second?

-Yeah, okay.

-Thank you very much.

-[laughing]

-What shall I do?

Oh that's awful. Well you must go and get rid of him.

Get rid of him.

I... okay. Oh, my God!

Louis... Louis, you go down.

-Take Louis.

-Come on, come with me. Come on.

Come on.

Oh, my God, it's so awful!

[laughs]

Whoops! Good boy.

-ALISTAIR: Writing?

-Yeah.

-Another film?

-Yes, another film.

Another film.

So look, I've bought these.

I know it's, uh,

Rosalind's birthday.

Oh, no, you remembered.

That is so touching.

-Um, thank--

-Hope you have a lovely day.

She will be thrilled.

We're having a really lovely celebratory day.

Good, good, good.

(CONVERSATION CONTINUES,

MUFFLED)

[Julie and Alistair murmuring]

-ALISTAIR: Okay.

-So much love to everybody.

ALISTAIR: Love to you all.

-JULIE: I certainly am and...

-Okay, darling.

All the better for seeing you and give everybody lots of love.

-And I'll see you soon.

-Yeah.

-Louis, come here.

-Take care.

ALISTAIR: Okay, so Louis, you're not coming with us.

Bulgy, come on. In the back.

Come on, let's go.

-[dogs barking]

-[Julie laughing]

Say goodbye... Okay...

Take care of yourself.

Yes, good boy.

-[car starts]

-Louis, come on.

[water splashing in bathtub]

[footsteps approaching]

-[feet stumbling]

-Oh!

-JULIE: Are you all right?

-No, I'm fine.

[mother sighs]

I love that dress.

What's all this?

Yeah, Louis and I did it.

You are naughty.

[sighs]

It's too much.

Which one are you gonna open first?

Oh, I don't know.

What do you think?

Well what about the one on your plate.

All right. What can that be?

Such pretty paper.

You'll be seeing it again at Christmas.

[gasps] Oh, my.

Goodness me, I recognize that.

Oh, darling.

Little box.

[gasps]

(CHIME PLAYING

"HAPPY BIRTHDAY")

Oh, no.

Do you like it?

Oh, that's the dearest little thing.

It's like... it's like the one Dad gave you.

Oh, how lovely, darling.

Thank you so much.

I'm going to put it on my dressing table.

Next to my pill box one.

Thank you so much.

I thought it would be nice.

One from Daddy and one from me.

Okay, which one next?

I think I might spin it out, actually, darling.

-All right.

-Save them up.

-Feeling a bit puffed, actually.

-[footsteps approaching]

RECEPTIONIST: Hi.

Would you like me to open the champagne for you?

Oh, no, no. Don't worry,

I'll do it. Thank you.

-Yeah? Okay.

-Yes, thank you.

You ready for some bubbles?

Going to do it yourself?

Good girl.

I don't want to do any damage to the beautiful ceiling.

[laughs]

-[cork pops]

-Oh!

[chuckles] Oh, darling, just a-- just a little.

-[sparkling wine pouring]

-Just a, just the tiniest drop.

That'll do it, thank you.

Thank you, thank you.

Happy birthday, Mum.

To us.

Oh, I'm actually starving.

Oh, lovely. Mm!

Bubbles went up my nose.

[sniffles]

What do you want?

Know the menu quite well by now.

Oh, yes, um...

I think I'm gonna have exactly what I had yesterday.

I thought it was-- I've been thinking about it all day.

Yes. Let's have a look.

You know, darling,

I'm not sure that I can manage any dinner quite yet.

-I think I'll, uh,

-Oh, Mum.

You have to have something.

Just a starter?

I'll just... I--

Just nothing, I think, for the moment.

Well we can wait.

Yeah, we can...

Yeah, we can order later.

You... you choose something lovely and I'll, uh, enjoy watching you eat it.

No, I... No I, well, I'm...

I'm... I'm not that hungry.

But you just said you were starving.

Well, I'm not gonna sit eating if you're not gonna have anything.

-Well, whyever not?

-Well--

Well, maybe I'm not hungry.

You say you're not hungry.

Oh, darling, don't be so silly.

Well, I...

Well, you order something lovely, and, uh... and-- and enjoy it.

[voice breaking] I don't have any hunger if you aren't hungry.

The second you tell me you're hungry and you want some food,

I will be hungry for it.

But if you're not gonna eat anything...

Oh, darling, wha...

Don't, just don't push me.

I... I'm not feeling very well.

Well, we can go up if you like.

We don't have to sit here.

No, don't fuss. Don't fuss.

Don't fuss.

It just makes me feel worse when you do.

I'm not fussing.

What do you expect me to do when you say you're not feeling well?

It's like a nightmare.

Oh darling.

Have something delicious and... and I'll enjoy watching you eating it.

I'm not hungry.

I'm not gonna eat if you don't.

Mum, I don't know how this happened. Well, how did--

I just want you to be happy.

I just--

I'm trying all the time to make you happy.

I can't keep guessing.

Can't you just tell me, you just...

You're like a sort of mystery person to me.

And I, I've spent all my life doing this.

Trying to figure out how to make you happy.

And I have a life of my own.

I have a husband who I neglect completely, and I don't have that much time left.

And I don't have a family beyond you.

I don't have any children.

And I'm not gonna have anybody to fuss over me when I'm your age.

[panting lightly]

[footsteps approaching]

[under breath] Ah, fu...

Are you ready to order?

JULIE: Um, we're not actually gonna have anything.

Um, thank you very much.

Nothing at all?

No, no, no. Not, not, no--

I'll let you know when we do.

-Okay.

-Thank you.

Mum, I really didn't mean to say that.

[Julie crying]

[Julie sniffling]

[footsteps approaching]

-Yes?

-Are you ready for the cake?

Oh-- Could you come with me, please?

Could you not mention the cake at the table?

-Um, okay.

-If you could go and collect it, bring it here, with the candle.

I will light the candle.

-All right.

-Quick, go and get it.

Yeah, I will.

[Julie sniffles]

-I said I wanted to light it.

-Okay.

And I want to carry it in like this.

Thank you. Thank you.

Yes, thank you.

-There.

-Thank you.

Um, I just wanted to say before you go that I, uh...

I hope you're okay.

Thank you.

And I was going to say thank you for looking after me.

-[chuckles]

-Um, merry Christmas.

-Have a happy Christmas.

-You, too.

-Bye-bye.

-Good bye.

# Private Romeo

Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme

I came to talk of.

Tell me, daughter Juliet,

How stands your disposition to be married?

- It is an honour that I dream not of.

- An honour!

Were not I thine only nurse, I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

Well, think of marriage now;

Younger than you, here in Verona, ladies of esteem, are made already mothers.

- Thus then in brief...

- Madam, the guests are come, supper served up you called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in the pantry, and every thing in extremity.

I must hence to wait.

- I beseech you, follow straight.

- We follow thee.

Five, six, seven, eight nine. ten, eleven, twelve...

Good-morrow, Romeo.

- Is the day so young?

- But new struck nine.

Ay me! Benvolio, sad hours seem long.

What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

In love?

- Out.

- Of love?

Out of her favour, where I am in love.

Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

What, shall I groan and tell thee?

Groan! Why, no.

But sadly tell me who.

In sadness, Benvolio, I do love a woman.

I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.

A right good mark-man!

And she's fair I love.

A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

Well, in that hit you miss:

She'll not be hit with Cupid's arrow;

She hath forsworn to love and in that vow do I live dead that live to tell it now.

Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

I'll teach you, or else die in debt.

Mark time, march!

Left. right, left, right!

Then, halt!

Dress right, dress!

Ready, front!

Listen up!

Those of you who did not qualified for the land navigation excersises and are remaining here on campus, you'll be under the command of cadet Moreno and myself.

There will be no officers or faculty on campus for the next four days.

We'll follow a regular schedule without variation.

Classwork, homework, physical fitness.

We are all McKinley

Military Academy cadets.

Which means we will maintain the highest standards of neatness, promptness, orderliness, and military bearing at all times!

And no trouble!

Understood?

Yes. sir!

Dismissed!

Cadet Neff!

Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits

Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

Had I say to stop?

And we mean well in going to this mask, but 'tis no wit to go.

Why, may one ask?

I dream'd a dream to-night.

And so did I.

- Well, what was yours?

- That dreamers often lie.

In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.

- She is the fairies' midwife...

- Dismissed!

What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight?

I know not, sir.

O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!

Read!

It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night

Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;

Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!

So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,

As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.

Josh!

Cadets! No running in the hall!

Yes, sir!

- Hi.

- Hi.

Where are you going?

Glenn!

Gus!

Gus!

Do you think I'm gonna get into West Point?

You really think so?

You ask me everyday.

Feel this.

I've load 130.

Can I go back to sleep now?

- Cadet Singleton!

- Yes, sir!

You've to be showering and be not late for inspection.

Yes. sir!

Dismissed!

Right dress!

Left dress!

About face!

- Omar.

- Shit!

- Cadet Madsen/

- Ya!

Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,

I bade her come..

What, lamb! what, ladybird!

Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

What, lamb! what, ladybird!

Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

What, Juliet.

How now! Who calls?

What, lamb!

What, ladybird!

What Juliette ?

And we mean well in going to this mask;

But 'tis no wit to go.

Why, may one ask?

I dream'd...

I dream'd a dream to-night.

And so did I.

Well, what was yours?

That dreamers often lie.

In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.

She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes

In shape no bigger than an agate-stone.

On the fore-finger of an alderman

Drawn with a team of little atomies

Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;

Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut

Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs

The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,

The traces of the smallest spider's web.

Her whip of cricket's bone,  the lash of film,

Her driver a small grey-coated gnat

Not so big as a round little worm

Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid.

And in this state she gallops  night by night

Through lovers' brains,  and then they dream of love;

O'er ladies ' lips,  who straight on kisses dream,

Which oft the angry Mab  with blisters plagues,

Because their breaths  with sweetmeats tainted are:

Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,

And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,

Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,

Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,

And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two

And sleeps again.

Peace, peace,

Thou talk'st of nothing.

I talk of dreams,

Which are the children of an idle brain,

Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,

Which is as thin of substance as the air

And more inconstant than the wind...

This wind, you talk of,  blows us from ourselves;

Come! Knock and enter!

Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

Welcome, gentlemen!

Ladies that have their toes Unplagued with corns will have about with you.

A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.

She that makes dainty,

She, I'll swear, hath corns.

Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes

With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead

So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,

And soar with them above a common bound.

I am too sore enpierced with his shaft

To soar...

Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

And, to sink in it, should you burden love;

Too great oppression for a tender thing.

Is love a tender thing?

It is too rough, Too rude,  too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

If love be rough with you,  be rough with love;

Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.

What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight?

I know not.

O, she doth teach the torches  to burn bright!

It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night as a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;

Beauty too rich for use,  for earth too dear!

So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,

As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.

The measure done,

I'll watch her place of stand,

And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.

Did my heart love till now?

For swear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

What?

What dares the slave

Come hither, cover'd with an antic face, to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

Why, how now. Wherefore storm you so?

This is our foe, that villain Romeo.

Ttake no note of him.

Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,

And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

- I'll not endure him!

- He shall be endured.

Am I the master here, or you?

Go to.

Go to!

Why,

'tis a shame.

Be quiet, or... for shame!

I'll make you quiet.

Sure.

I like your kicks in it, nice.

- Thanks.

- Is it like a...

- That's the loose string.

- It's cool.

I like it.

And what is... Oh!

If I profane with my unworthiest hand

This holy shrine,  the gentle thin is this:

My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand

To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,

Which mannerly devotion shows in this;

For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,

And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

Ay, pilgrim, lips  that they must use in prayer.

O, then, dear saint,  let lips do what hands do;

They pray, grant thou,  lest faith turn to despair.

Saints do not move,  though grant for prayers' sake.

Then move not,  while my prayer's effect I take.

I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall now  seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

Thus from my lips,  by yours, my sin is purged.

Then have my lips the sin  that they have took.

Sin from thy lips?

O trespass sweetly urged!

Give me my sin again.

It makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.

Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

Come!

Let's away.

Romeo,

Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

Romeo!

My cousin Romeo?

He is wise, Benvolio.

And, on my life,  hath stol'n him home to bed.

He ran this way.

- Call, good Mercutio.

- Nay,

I'll conjure too.

Romeo!

Humours!

Madman!

Lover!

Passion!

Romeo!

Romeo!

Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:

Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;

And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

This cannot anger him: my invocation Is fair and honest.

Come.

He hath hid himself among these trees,

To be consorted with the humorous night:

Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

If love be blind, it cannot hit the mark.

Romeo...

Good night.

I'll to my bed:

This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.

Go, then.

For 'tis in vain to seek him here that means not to be found.

He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

But, soft!

What light through yonder window breaks?

It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,

Who is already sick and pale with grief,

That thou her maid art far more fair than she.

O Romeo.

Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?

Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

What's in a name?

That which we call a rose

By any other name would smell as sweet.

So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title.

Romeo, doff thy name, and for that name which is no part of thee take all myself.

I take thee at thy word: call me but love, and I'll be new baptized

Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night so stumblest on my counsel?

By a name

I know not how to tell thee who I am,

My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, because it is an enemy to thee.

My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words of that tongue's utterance,

 yet I know the sound.

Art thou not Romeo?

- and a Montague?

- Neither, if either thee dislike.

How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?

The orchard walls  are high and hard to climb.

And the place death, considering who thou art,

 if any of my kinsmen find thee here.

With love's light wings  did I o'er-perch these walls.

For stony limits cannot hold love out.

And what love can do that dares love attempt;

Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.

If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye

Than twenty of their swords.

Look thou but sweet,

And I am proof against their enmity.

Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,

Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek

For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.

O gentle Romeo,

If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.

Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,

I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay.

So thou wilt woo.

- If my heart's dear love...

- Well, do not swear.

Although I joy in thee,

I have no joy of this contract to-night:

It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.

O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

The exchange of thy love's  faithful vow for mine.

I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:

And yet I would it were to give again.

Wouldst thou withdraw it?

For what purpose, love?

But to be frank, and give it thee again.

And yet I wish but for the thing I have:

My bounty is as boundless as the sea, my love as deep.

The more I give to thee, the more I have, for both are infinite.

Juliet!

Anon, good nurse!

Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.

If that thy bent of love be honourable, thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow by one that I'll procure to come to thee,

Where and what time thou wilt  perform the rite,

And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world.

- Madam!

- I come, anon.

But if thou mean'st not well,

I do beseech thee...

- Madam!

- By and by, I come.

To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief.

- To-morrow will I send.

- So thrive my soul...

A thousand times good night!

A thousand times the worse,  to want thy light.

Love goes toward love,  like schoolboys from their books.

But love from love,  toward school with heavy looks

At what o'clock to-morrow shall I send to thee?

By the hour of nine.

I will not fail.

'tis twenty years till then.

Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say good night , till it be morrow.

Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!

Would I were sleep and peace,  so sweet to rest!

Follow me

To the shipwreck shores  of a dark and strange country.

I was born

A stranger thinking out loud in a foreign tongue.

I was out of place.

I was looking all around just a'trying to find a friendly face.

But they're all gone.

Did you ever think?

Did you ever think?

Did you ever think? 

Did you ever think, think?

Who left me all alone in this town.

And a busted heart

Is a welcome friend

And when that heart leaves

What will you do then?

And if I cry,

Is that a sin?

And the wisdom is a whisper.

And I'm trying to understand,

What I say, what I think,

Where I sleep, when I breathe.

What I do with my hands.

Did you ever think?

Did you ever think?

Did you ever think? Did you ever think, think?

A lotta people everyday  who will surely drown.

Did you ever think?

Did you ever think?

Did you ever think? 

Did you ever think, think?

Who left me all alone in this town? 

Here is the McKinley Military Academy!

Which strives to develop young men with good character.

To cultivate the traits of honor,  duty, respect, and pride.

Now to accomplish that the Academy follows a military system, in which discipline is cornerstone.

Any cadet who violates regulations or commits offences against good order and discipline must be punished appropriately and justly.

You are all recievied one demerit.

Put yourself to the mess for breakfast!

Company, dismissed!

Carlos!

You take care of Neff.

Pick up the pace, cadet Neff!

Good morrow, father Laurence!

Good morrow, father Laurence.

What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?

Young son, it argues a distemper'd head

So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.

Or if not so, then here I hit it right,

Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

That last is true.

The sweeter rest was mine.

That's my good son:  but where hast thou been, then?

I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.

I have been feasting with mine enemy,

Where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded.

Both our remedies within thy help and holy physic lies.

Be plain, good son,  and homely in thy drift.

Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich Capulet.

As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine.

And all combined.

By holy marriage.

Holy Saint Francis,

What a change is here!

- I pray thee, chide not...

- But come, young waverer, come, go with me, in one respect I'll thy assistant be.

For this alliance may so happy prove, to turn your households' rancour to pure love.

O, let us hence.

- I stand on sudden haste.

- Wisely and slowly.

They stumble that run fast.

Where the devil should this Romeo be?

Came he not home tonight?

Came he not home tonight?

No, he didn't come home.

Where the devil should this Romeo be?

- Hie Romeo!

- Signior Romeo!

Bonjour!

French salutation for your French slop.

You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.

Good morrow to you Mercutio, Benvolio.

What counterfeit did I give you?

The slip, sir.

The slip; can you not conceive ?

Pardon, good Mercutio. 

My business was great.

And in such a case as mine  a man may strain courtesy.

That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.

Meaning, to court'sy?

- Thou hast most kindly hit it!

- A most courteous exposition.

Nay,

I am the very pink of courtesy.

Pink for flower?

- Right.

- Why, then is my pump well flowered.

Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?

Now art thou sociable.

Now art thou Romeo.

Now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.

God ye good morning, gentlemen.

God ye good evening, fair gentlewoman.

- Is it greasy?

- Just no less.

For the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon.

Out upon you! What a man are you!

One, good nurse, that

God has made for himself to mar.

By my troth, it is well said:

'for himself to mar,' quoth a?

Sir, I desire some confidence with you.

She will invite him to some supper.

Romeo, will you come?

We'll to dinner, thither.

I will follow you.

Farewell, ancient lady.

Lady.

Lady, lady!

I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?

A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.

An a' speak any thing against me,

I'll take him down!

An a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks!

And if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.

Scurvy knave!

Pray you, sir, a word.

My... young lady bade me inquire you out.

And what she bade me say,

I will keep to myself, but... first let me say, if you... should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say.

For the gentlewoman is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

Bid her devise some means to come to shrift this afternoon.

And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell be shrived and married.

This afternoon?

Well, she shall be there.

Farewell.

Be trusty, and I'll award thy pains.

God in heaven bless thee!

Farewell.

Commend me to thy mistress.

Ay, a thousand times.

Cadets Singleton, Madsen!

Hi, Ken, Carlos.

Too busy to workout today, cadets?

Come on!

Since you didn't get your exercise in this period why don't you both drop and give me 40.

Yes, sir!

- Forty ? I can't, I have to...

- Fifty for you, Omar!

Shit!

And when you're done, cadet Madsen, give me 5 tours around the track.

Physical fitness is an important component of cadet's education and training.

Yes, sir!

The clock struck nine when

I did send the nurse.

In half an hour she promised to return.

Now is the sun upon the highmost hill of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve

Is three long hours, yet she is not come.

O honey nurse, what news?

Hast thou met with him?

O Lord, why look'st thou sad?

I am a-weary, give me leave awhile.

Fie, how my bones ache!

I would... I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.

Speak! Speak!

What haste? Can you not stay awhile?

Do you not see that I am out of breath?

How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath?

- Is thy news good, or bad? Answer to that.

- Lord, how my head aches!

What a head have I !

It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.

O, my back!

Now other side...

O, my back, my back!

Beshrew your heart for sending me about, to catch my death with jaunting up and down!

I am sorry that thou art not well.

Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

What says he of our marriage?

Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind,  and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous.

Where is your mother?

Where is my mother!

Where should she be? 

How oddly thou repliest:

'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,

Where is your mother?'

O God's lady dear!

Are you so hot?

Is this the poultice for my aching bones!

Henceforward do your messages yourself!

Here's such a fourth come, what says Romeo?

Have you got leave to go to shrift today?

I have.

Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell.

There stays a husband to make you a wife.

Go! I'll to dinner.

Hie you to the cell!

Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse.

Farewell.

Hey you up for some hoops then?

How long is it now to Lammas-tide?

A fortnight and odd days.

Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.

As I said, I remember it well

'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years and she was wean'd.

I never shall forget it, of all the days  upon that year.

Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.

An I shall live to see thee married once,

I have my wish.

I'm sorry.

So smile the heavens upon this holy act, that after hours with sorrow chide us not!

But come what sorrow can it cannot countervail the exchange of joy that one short minute gives me in her sight.

Then love-devouring death do what he dare, it is enough I may but call her mine.

Here comes the lady.

Juliet, if the measure of thy joy be heap'd like mine...

But my true love is grown to such excess,

I cannot sum up sum of... half my wealth.

Come.

Go.

Incorporate two in one.

Thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says:

'God send me no need of thee!' and by the end of the second cup draws it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

Am I like such a fellow?

Thou! Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast.

Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes.

Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter?

With another, for tying his new shoes with old riband?

I pray thee, let's retire.

The day is hot, we shall not escape abroad.

By my heel, I care not.

Gentlemen, a word with one of you.

And but one word with one of us?

Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.

You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me occasion.

Could you not take some occasion without giving?

Thou consort'st with Romeo!

Consort!

What, dost thou make us minstrels?

Thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords.

We talk here in the public haunt of men.

Here all eyes gaze on us.

Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.

I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.

But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.

Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford

No better term than this:

Thou art a villain!

Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee

Doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting: villain am I none.

Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.

Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me.

Therefore turn and draw.

I do protest, I never injured thee.

O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!

Tybalt!

You rat-catcher/

Will you walk?

What wouldst thou have with me?

Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives. that I mean to make bold withal, and as you shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the eight.

Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher by the ears?

Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.

I am for you.

Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.

Gentlemen, the prince expressly hath

Forbidden bandying in Verona streets.

Hold, Tybalt!

Good Mercutio!

- Away!

- Tybalt!

- Is he gone, and hath nothing?

- What, art thou hurt?

Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch.

Marry, 'tis enough.

Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church-door, but  marry 'tis enough.

Ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man.

I am peppered, I warrant, for this world.

A plague on both your houses!

Why the devil came you between us?

I was hurt under your arm.

I thought all for the best.

Help me, Benvolio, or I shall faint.

A plague on both your houses!

They have made worms' meat of me.

O sweet Juliet,

Thy beauty hath made me effeminate and in my temper soften'd valour's steel!

Romeo!

This day's black fate on more days doth depend;

This but begins the woe, others must end.

Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!

Tybalt, take the villain back again, that late thou gavest me.

For Mercutio's soul Is but a little way above our heads,

 staying for thine to keep him company.

Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.

Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here, shalt with him hence!

This shall determine that.

Romeo, away, be gone!

Stand not amazed:

 the prince will doom thee death, if thou art taken!

Be gone, away!

O, I am fortune's fool!

Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

Benvolio?

O noble prince, I can discover all the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.

There lies Tybalt, slain by young Romeo,

That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

Prince, as thou art true.

For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague!

I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give.

Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.

Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

Not Romeo, prince!

He was Mercutio's friend.

His fault concludes but what the law should end, the life of Tybalt.

And for that offence immediately we do exile him hence.

I will be deaf to pleading or excuses; nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses: therefore use none.

Let Romeo hence in haste, else, when he's found, that hour is his last.

Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, that runaway's eyes may wink , and Romeo leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.

Come, night; come, Romeo, come, thou day in night, for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night whiter than new snow on a raven's back!

Why dost thou wring thy hands?

He's dead, he's dead!

Alack the day! He's gone, he's dead!

He's dead!

Hath Romeo slain himself?

I saw the wound, here on his manly breast, all bedaub'd in blood.

I swounded at the sight.

O, break, my heart!

Poor bankrupt, break at once...

O Tybalt, Tybalt.

What storm is this that blows so contrary?

Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?

Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished.

O God!

Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

It did.

Alas the day, it did!

There's no trust, no faith, no honesty.

Shame come to Romeo!

Blister'd be thy tongue for such a wish!

He was not born to shame.

'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo - banished'.

That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,' hath slain ten thousand Tybalts.

There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, in that word's death.

No words can that woe sound.

Go! Find Romeo.

Give this ring to my true knight, and bid him come to take his last farewell.

What news?

I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.

What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?

A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips, not body's death, but body's banishment.

Ha, banishment!

Be merciful, say 'death'!

This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here, where Juliet lives.

Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak.

O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

I'll give thee armour to keep off that word.

Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy, to comfort thee, though thou art banished.

Hang up philosophy!

Unless philosophy can make a Juliet, it helps not.

O, then I see that madmen have no ears.

How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.

Romeo, hide thyself.

Who knocks? Whence come you?

What's your will?

O, tell me, where's Romeo?

There on the ground.

Stand up.

Stand up!

For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand.

Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?

What says my conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

O, she says nothing.

And now falls on her bed; and then starts up, and then on Romeo cries, and then down falls again.

As if that name did murder her!

What, rouse thee, man!

Man!

A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back.

Happiness courts thee in her best array.

But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench, thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.

Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.

Go, get thee to thy love.

I'll tell my lady you will come.

Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you.

Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

How well my comfort is revived by this!

Go hence.

Farewell; good night.

But that a joy past joy calls out on me, it were a grief, so brief to part with thee.

Wilt thou be gone?

It is not yet near day.

It was the nightingale, and not the lark, that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.

It was the lark, the herald of the morn, no nightingale.

Look, love, what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.

I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I.

It is some meteor that the sun exhales, to be to thee this night a torch-bearer.

Therefore stay yet.

Thou need'st not to be gone.

Let me be taken, let me be put to death.

I am content, so thou wilt have it so.

I have more care to stay than will to go:

Come, death, and welcome!

Juliet wills it so.

Madam!

Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

Farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.

Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay, husband, friend!

O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

I doubt it not.

And all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our time to come.

O fortune, fortune! 

All men call thee fickle.

Be fickle, fortune, for then, I hope,  thou wilt not keep him long, but send him back.

But now, my lord Capulet,  what say you to my suit?

But saying o'er what I have said before: my child is yet a stranger in this world.

She hath not seen the change  of fourteen years.

Let two more summers wither in their pride, ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

Younger than she are happy mothers made.

And too soon marr'd  are those so early made.

The earth hath swallow'd  all my hopes but she,

She is the hopeful lady of my earth.

But woo her, get her heart.

My will to her consent is but a part; and she agree.

Lady Capulet.

Nurse, where's my daughter? 

Call her forth to me.

Are you up?

Who is't that calls?

Why, how now?

I am not well.

Evermore weeping for Tybalt's death?

What, wilt thou wash him  from his grave with tears?

And if thou couldst,  thou couldst not make him live.

Therefore, have done.

Some grief shows much of love; but much of grief shows still some want of wit.

Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend which you weep for.

Feeling so the loss, cannot choose but ever weep the friend/

But now

I'll tell thee joyful tidings.

And joy comes well in such a needy time.

What are they?

Well, well, thou hast  a careful father, child.

One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy, that thou expect'st not  nor I look'd not for.

In happy time, what day is that?

Early next Thursday morning, the gallant, young and noble gentleman, the County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride.

I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,

I will not marry yet.

And, when I do, it shall be Romeo!

Here comes your father; tell him so yourself, and see how he will take it at your hands.

How now, wife?

- Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

- Ay, sir; but she will none.

I would the fool were married to her grave!

Is she not proud?

Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bride?

Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have.

Proud can I never be of what I hate.

But thankful even for hate,  that is meant love.

How?

How now, how now, how?

Chop-logic! What is this?

'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'

 and yet 'not proud'.

Mistress minion, you, thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds, but fettle your fine joints 'gainst

Thursday next, to Saint Peter's Church, or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.

Good father, I beseech you on my knees, hear me with patience but to speak a word.

Hang thee, young baggage!

Disobedient wretch!

Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.

My fingers itch.

O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!

Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.

Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee!

What say'st thou?

Hast thou not a word of joy?

Some comfort, nurse.

Here it is.

Romeo is banish'd.

And all the world is nothing, that he dares ne'er come back to you.

Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.

I think it best you married with Paris.

Speakest thou from thy heart?

And from my soul too!

- Amen!

- What?

Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.

Go in: and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to make confession and to be absolved.

I will.

This is wisely done.

Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!

Sir, he is fine.

He was treated in the emergency room.

Yes. sir!

Yeah, but the doctor said...

Yes, I realized that, sir.

I take full responsibility, sir.

Of course.

Yes, sir!

Come weep with me.

Past hope, past cure, past help!

I already know thy grief.

I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, on Thursday next be married.

Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,

 unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.

If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, do thou but call my resolution wise, and with this knife I'll help it presently.

Hold!

I do spy a kind of hope.

And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.

O, bid me leap from off the battlements of yonder tower, and I will do it without fear or doubt.

Hold, then: go home.

Take thou this vial, and this distilled liquor drink thou off.

When presently through all thy veins shall run a cold and drowsy humour.

The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade to play ashes, thy eyes' windows fall, like death, when he shuts up the day of life.

And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death thou shalt continue.

And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.

In the mean time, shall Romeo come: and he and I will watch thy waking.

And this shall free thee from this present shame.

Give me!

Go, hence.

Be strong and prosperous In this resolve.

Love give me strength!

Farewell.

What if this drink do not work at all?

What if it be a poison, which the friar

Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead?

I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not, for he hath still been tried a holy man

How if, when I am laid into the tomb,

I wake before the time that Romeo comes?

There's a fearful point!

Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault and there die strangled?

O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught?

And madly play with my forefather's joints?

And pluck the mangled

Tybalt from his shroud?

And, in this rage with some great kinsman's bone, as... with a club, dash out my desperate brains?

O! Methinks I see my cousin's ghost.

Stay, Tybalt!

Stay!

Romeo!

Romeo...

I drink to thee.

High school ring,

High school ring.

Who would have guessed it was a homicidal thing?

Crying, crying, crying, on your front porch swing.

Eyes swollen up like a yellowjacket sting.

Call him a thief, call him a crook,

You never get back what the magpie took.

Call him a raven, call him a rook,

Sam!

You never get back what the magpie took.

Sam!

Sam!

Your boyfriends mean,

Your boyfriends mean,

I swear, I swear, I swear

I didn't say anything.

Your grandmother's silver

You kept it so clean,

And those dark glasses, can you see what I mean.

Call him a thief, call him a crook,

You never get back what the magpie took.

Call him a raven, call him a rook,

You never get back what the magpie took.

Help!

Help!

Juliet's dead!

Juliet's dead!

How now?

How doth my lady?

How fares my Juliet?

For nothing can be ill, if she be well!

She is well, and nothing can be ill.

Her body sleeps in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with angels lives.

O well you art not conquered.

O my love!

Beauty's ensign still Is crimson in thy cheeks and thy lips, and death's pale flag is not advanced there.

Shall I believe that unsubstantial death is amorous, and keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour?

For fear of that, I still will stay with thee.

And never from this palace of dim night depart again.

Here's to my love!

Here will I remain.

How long hath he been there?

Full half an hour.

Go with me.

Fear comes upon me.

O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.

Where is my lord?

I do remember well where I should be, and there I am.

Where is my Romeo?

Come from this nest of unnatural sleep.

A power greater than we can contradict hath thwarted our intents.

Come!

Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.

Come, go, I dare no longer stay.

Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.

I will kiss thy lips.

Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, to make die with a restorative.

You made me love you

I didn't want to do it,

I didn't want to do it.

You made me want you,

And all the time you knew it.

I guess you always knew it.

You made me happy sometimes

You made me glad.

But there were times, baby,

You made me feel so bad.

You made me cry for

I didn't want to tell you,

I didn't want to tell you.

I want some love that's true.

Yes I do, indeed I do, 

You know I do.

Give me, give me, give me what I cry for.

You know you got the kind o' kisses that I'd die for,

You know you made me love you.

You made me cry for

I didn't want to tell you,

I didn't want to tell you.

I want some love that's true.

Yes I do, indeed I do, 

You know I do.

Give me, give me, give me what I cry for.

You know you got the kind o' kisses that I'd die for,

You know you made me love you.

You know you made me love you.





# Whiplash

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

No. Stay.

What's your name?

Andrew Neiman, sir.

What year are you?

I'm first year.

- Do you know who I am?

- Yes, sir.

So you know

I'm looking for players.

Yes, sir.

Then why did you stop playing?

Did I ask you to start playing?

- Sorry, I...

- I asked why you stopped playing, and your answer was to turn into a wind-up monkey.

- Sorry, I thought...

- Show me your rudiments.

Yes, sir.

Double-time swing.

No, double-time. Double it.

Faster. Faster.

Oopsy-daisy.

Forgot my jacket.

- No Swedish Fish?

- No, not today.

- Thanks.

- Mm-hm.

- You okay? Hm?

- Yeah.

Yeah. Well, I don't know.

He saw me play today.

And?

Mm.

Well, you got plenty of options still.

- What does that mean?

- Just...

- Other options?

- Just, you know...

It's just life.

Listen, when you get to be my age, you get perspective.

I don't want perspective.

Sorry.

All right.

I don't want the Raisinets.

Why didn't you say that?

I just eat around them.

I don't understand you.

Bye. I'll see you later. Bye.

My man, Ry. Oh, shit.

How you feeling, man?

It's been too long.

Been too long.

Things were hurting with Neiman on the kits.

Come on, man.

- What?

- He's fine.

- If you say so. Good seeing you.

- Yeah.

Yo, looking good.

What's up? Hey.

- Good weekend?

- Yeah, real good.

- Yeah?

- Yeah. Lot of fun.

Nice.

Hey, don't worry about Greg.

Kid's a dick.

Oh.

- No big deal.

- Good morning, everybody.

Good morning, everybody.

- Good morning.

- All right.

Let's do "Billy Zane" from the top, yes? Yes?

- How's that? Good?

- Little right.

One, two, three, unh...

Okay.

Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

All right, let's do reeds, yeah?

- Three.

- Yo, Ryan.

Watch it.

Yeah.

Accent, yeah...

Not today.

Big on the bottom.

Put some sugar on it.

You embarrass yourself like what's-his-face.

That was truly pathetic.

Short.

All right. All right.

That's enough of that. Just back to the core drums, please.

Core players, let's go.

Dude, what have you been practicing?

May I?

Cute.

Down the line.

Trumpets, bars seven and eight.

Three, four.

Three, four.

Okay. All right.

Trombone, bar 24.

The and of two.

Maybe not.

Tenor, let's start the pickup to 11.

Three, four.

Same spot. Three, four.

Okay. All right.

You're in the first chair.

Let's see if it's because you're cute.

Three, four.

Yep. That's why.

Drums. Let's hear a little double-time swing.

Behind.

Same thing.

Bass, five bars of "Donna Lee."

All right.

Drums, with me.

Thank you, Joe.

No, no, no. Other drums.

Room B-16 tomorrow morning,

6:00 a.m. Don't be late.

All right, everybody, from the top.

A-one, two, three, unh...

- Hey.

- How are you?

- Good. How are you?

- Good, thanks.

Good.

- Uh, the usual? You want, like...?

- No.

Look, I don't really know how...

I see you in here a lot, and I think that you're really pretty and...

Would you wanna go out with me ever?

Please go away.

- Oh, God.

- Get out.

- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

- I'm just messing with you.

- I'm messing with you. Ha, ha.

- What? Oh, my God.

Ha-ha-ha. I'm sorry.

- That's actually pretty mean.

- That should've... I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

- What's your name?

- It's okay. No big deal.

Oh, I'm Andrew.

- Andrew.

- Yeah.

- I'm Nicole.

- Nice to meet you, Nicole.

Nice to meet you too.

- So you wanna take me out.

- I would love to take you out.

- Where do you wanna go?

- Pizza.

- Pizza.

- Yeah.

- I like pizza.

- Yeah, I know this great pizza place.

Cool. Okay, well...

Uh...

I get off at 7 on Monday.

- Okay.

- You wanna meet here?

- Okay. Yeah. I will.

- Yeah.

Great.

Okay. Seven o'clock?

- Mm-hm. Here.

- At 7 p.m.

- Monday. Andrew.

- All right.

- Bye.

- Bye.

It's not that bad. She's a go-go dancer.

Could've did porn, she chose not to.

- That make it better?

- Yeah, little bit.

- That's classier.

- I can deal with that.

Bitch had a foot fetish or something.

- This is good.

- You get on that?

That's it.

You are fucking kidding me.

- You the new alternate?

- Yeah. I'm Andrew Neiman.

Tune the set to B-flat, then turn my pages.

Sure.

Excuse me.

Um, could I get a B-flat?

Thank you.

Sorry. Can you...?

Just one more time?

That's a great kit.

I play the new cymbals now.

Milk the cunt!

We got a squeaker today, people.

Neiman.

Nineteen years old.

Isn't he cute?

All right, gang, "Whiplash."

Page. Page!

Barker, that is not your boyfriend's dick.

Do not come early.

Bar 93.

Five, six, and...

Stop.

Now, this one really upsets me.

We have an out-of-tune player here.

Before I continue, would that player care to identify himself?

No?

Okay, maybe a bug flew in my ear.

One-fifteen.

Five, six, and...

No. My ears are fine.

We definitely have an out-of-tune player.

Whoever it is, this is your last chance.

And there it went.

Now, either you are deliberately playing out of tune, and sabotaging my band, or you don't know you're out of tune, which I'm afraid is even worse.

Reeds.

Five, six, and...

Bones.

Five, six, and...

He's here.

Tell me it's not you,

Elmer Fudd.

It's okay. Play.

Do you think you're out of tune?

There's no fucking Mars bar down there.

What are you looking at?

Look up here. Look at me.

Do you think you're out of tune?

Um...

Yes.

Then why the fuck didn't you say so?

I've carried your fat ass for too long.

I won't have you cost us a competition because your mind's on a Happy

Meal instead of on pitch.

Jackson, congratulations, you're fourth chair.

Metz, why are you still sitting there?

Get the fuck out!

For the record, Metz wasn't out of tune.

You were, Erickson.

But he didn't know, and that's bad enough.

All right, take 10. When we get back, the squeaker's on.

Two, two, three.

Two, two, three.

If he put half the effort into playing the trombone...

Andrew.

- Parents musicians?

- No.

- What do they do?

- My dad's a writer.

Oh, what's he written?

- I guess he's more of a teacher, really.

- Oh.

- College?

- Pennington High School.

- Your mother, what does she do?

- I don't know. She left when I was a baby.

No musicians in the family?

You just gotta listen to the greats, then.

Buddy Rich, Jo Jones...

You know, Charlie Parker became Bird because Jones threw a cymbal at his head.

- See what I'm saying?

- Mm-hm.

Listen, the key is to just relax.

Don't worry about the numbers.

Don't worry about what other guys are thinking.

You're here for a reason.

You believe that, right?

Yeah.

Say it.

I'm here for a reason.

Cool.

All right, man. Have fun.

All right, gang, "Whiplash."

A little under tempo, okay?

Neiman, just do your best.

Here we go.

Five, six, and...

Let's hear some fills.

We got Buddy Rich here.

A little trouble there.

Just pick it up at 17.

Ready?

Five, six, and...

Not quite my tempo.

Here we go.

Five, six, and...

Downbeat on 18. Okay?

Here we go.

Five, six, and...

Bar 17, the and of four.

Got it?

Five, six, seven...

Not quite my tempo. It's all good.

No worries. Here we go.

Five, six, seven...

You're rushing.

Here we go.

Five... Ready? Okay.

Five, six, and...

Dragging just a hair.

Wait for my cue.

Five, six, seven...

Rushing. Five, six, and...

Dragging. Five, six, and...

Why do you suppose I just hurled a chair at your head, Neiman?

- I don't know.

- Sure you do.

- The tempo?

- Were you rushing or dragging?

I don't know.

- Start counting.

- Five, six, seven...

In four, damn it.

Look at me.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three...

Now, was I rushing or was I dragging?

I don't know.

Count again.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

Rushing or dragging?

Rushing.

So you do know the difference.

If you deliberately sabotage my band,

I will fuck you like a pig.

Now, are you a rusher, or are you a dragger, or are you gonna be on my fucking time?

I'm gonna be on your time.

- What does that say?

- "Quarter note equals 215."

- Count me a 215.

- One, two, three, four.

- One, two, three, four.

- Jesus Christ.

I didn't know they allowed retards. Am I to understand that you cannot read tempo?

- Can you even read music? What's that?

- Eighth note.

- Yes. What is that?

- Dotted 16th note.

Sight-read measure 101.

What, are you in a fucking a cappella group? Play the goddamn kit.

Stop. Now answer my question.

Were you rushing or were you dragging?

- Answer!

- Rushing.

Oh, my dear God.

Are you one of those single-tear people?

Do I look like a double fucking rainbow to you? You must be upset.

- Are you upset?

- No.

No? So you just don't give a shit?

- I do give a shit.

- So are you upset? Yes or fucking no?

Yes, you are upset.

Yeah.

- Say it.

- I'm upset.

Say it so the whole band can hear you.

- I'm upset.

- Louder.

- I'm upset.

- Louder!

I'm upset.

You are a worthless, friendless, faggot-lipped piece of shit, whose Mommy left Daddy when she figured out he wasn't Eugene O'Neill.

Who's now weeping and slobbering all over my drum set like a fucking 9-year-old girl.

So for the final father-fucking time,

- say it louder!

- I'm upset!

Carl.

Start practicing harder, Neiman.

"Whiplash," bar 125.

Big-boy tempo.

Five, six, and...

This place is nice.

Yeah. I really like the music that they play.

Mm.

- I mean, the food's good too, but...

- No, the pizza's really good.

"When I Wake."

- What?

- That's the name of the song.

Oh. Ha, ha.

Jackie Hill, July 17th, 1938.

Bob Ellis on the drums.

Every time I saw you at the theater, your eyes were glued to the floor.

- Really? Oh...

- Mm-hm.

My dad says that I have...

I have trouble making eye contact.

My parents like to criticize me too.

Growing up, my mom said

I had a really big chin, that's why guys wouldn't like me.

- Really? You don't.

- Yeah.

Well, she said my dad cursed me with one.

It's like Jay Leno. Look.

- No, it's not.

- Yeah, it is.

- I don't... I don't think so at all.

- Well, that's nice.

- Your chin's very nice. Very nice.

- Ha-ha-ha.

Your mom sounds insane.

She did wanna be an actress when she was my age.

- What about you?

- What about me?

What do you do?

I go to Fordham.

What do you study?

I don't have a major yet.

- But, like, what do you want to study?

- I don't really know.

I don't know yet.

So Fordham was just like a random school?

No, I applied to a bunch of schools,

Fordham let me in.

- Why'd you pick Shaffer?

- It's the best music school in the country.

Well, Fordham was Fordham.

I don't love it there, to be honest.

- No?

- No.

I...

I don't know. I guess it's just the people.

I don't know if they like me very much.

I'm from Arizona, and I think they can see it.

- I feel the same about people at Shaffer.

- Oh, yeah?

Yeah. I don't think they like me too much.

But I don't... I don't...

I don't care too much.

I think it just... It changes.

You know, people change and things work out.

No, no, I know, I know.

I just...

I feel really homesick sometimes.

I don't know.

It kind of pisses me off when people pretend like they're not.

In college, you know?

Maybe I'm literally the only one,

I don't know.

I still go to the movies with my dad.

- Hey. How are you, man?

- Good to see you.

And please, is this really Eva? Wow.

Last time I saw you, you were very tiny.

Are you playing an instrument yet?

She started piano last week.

When you're a big college kid, will you come play in my band?

- Would you like that?

- Be my piano player?

Excellent.

Give me five, baby.

- All right. Great to see you.

- Great seeing you.

- See you after the show.

- All right. Absolutely.

All right. Cheers.

Listen up, Cocksuckers.

Hurry the fuck up.

Get your music.

"Irene" only. Set one.

Rhythm section out first.

The kit is a fucking tonal catastrophe.

Get it in tune, all right?

Rhythm and soloists, bar 45.

We're gonna pick up the tempo.

Bar 106, brass, do not forget we sharp that ninth.

Everybody remember,

Lincoln Center use these competitions to decide who they're interested in and who they're not.

I'm not gonna have my reputation in that department tarnished by a bunch of limp-dick, sour-note, flatter-than-their-girlfriends, flexible-tempo dipshits.

One more thing.

Give me that.

If I ever find one of these lying around again,

I swear to fucking God,

I will stop being so polite.

Get the fuck out of my sight before I demolish you.

Stage right, in order, now.

I can still fucking see you,

Mini-Me!

Let's go. Hurry the fuck up.

Let's go.

The Shaffer

Conservatory Studio Band.

Hold on to this for the second set.

He's dumb but he's not stupid.

At the end of the day, he wants a career, as dumb as he is.

Fudd has a chance of getting put back in, so why would he jeopardize that?

- I need to look at the music.

- It's right here.

Why isn't it on you?

Where's the folder?

- You're joking. You're fucking around?

- No...

I swear I had it here two seconds ago.

It's gotta be around here.

- Did you see...?

- How could you be so fucking stupid?

- I know. Maybe a janitor came by.

- A janitor?

Find the fucking folder!

A fucking janitor?

You're a dumb fuck!

A dumb fuck!

- Find the folder!

- Okay, I'm sorry.

Tanner!

Jesus fucking Christ, where have you been?

Uh, we have an issue.

Okay, now is not the time.

I gave Neiman the folder and Neiman lost it.

- Neiman lost it.

- Yes, sir.

The folder was your responsibility.

Why would you give it to Neiman?

Right?

Give a calculator to a retard, he's gonna turn on a TV with it.

- Get your sticks, get your ass on-stage.

- I... I can't.

You can't?

I... I can't go on-stage.

I don't know the charts by heart.

- Are you fucking kidding me?

- I... You know this.

I need the music.

It's my memory, I need visual cues.

Visual cues.

Yes. It's a medical...

A medical condition?

What, are you Sanjay Gupta?

Play the goddamn music.

- I can't.

- I can.

- You know "Whiplash" by heart?

- Yes. Every measure.

All right. Well, you better fucking hope your memory doesn't fail you.

I hope you play it a lot better than you did last month.

I do not intend to start losing.

Get your sticks and get your ass on-stage. On-stage!

And in first place,

Shaffer Conservatory.

Hey.

Don't fucking touch my folder, man.

Do not touch this kit.

All right, let's get to work, ladies.

Tanner, what you doing? It's core only.

I don't have time for alternates.

"Cherokee." From the top.

Tanner, are you a fucking statue?

Let's go. Get off the stool.

Don't forget to turn Neiman's pages.

Here we go.

One, two, three, four.

Two, two, three, four.

What did you do to your hand?

- Is that from drumming?

- Yeah. It's nothing.

So how's it going with the Studio Band?

Good.

Yeah, I think he likes me more now.

And his opinion means a lot to you, doesn't it?

Yeah.

Wanna grab the shakers?

Jimbo? Overcooked.

You can barely chew this.

He just laughs.

So how's the drumming going, Andy?

Yeah, it's going really well.

I'm the new core drummer, so...

- Hey.

- Congratulations.

Tom Brady.

- Did you hear, Jim?

- No, what?

- Trav got named this year's MVP.

- That's fantastic, Travis.

Yeah, and Dustin is heading up Model UN, soon to be Rhodes Scholar and who knows what else.

And Jim, teacher of the year.

- Well, hey, listen...

- I mean, come on.

The talent at this table, that is stunning.

- And Andy, with your drumming.

- It's going okay, Andy?

Yeah, it's going really, really well, actually.

I'm part of Shaffer's top jazz orchestra, which means it's the best in the country.

And I'm a core member so I'll start playing in competitions. I just...

I found out I'm the youngest person in the band.

How do you know who wins in a music competition? Isn't it subjective?

- No.

- Does the studio get you a job?

It's not an actual studio.

It's the name of the ensemble, but it's a big step forward in my career.

I'm so glad you figured it out.

It's a nasty business, I am sure.

Hey, are you gonna tell them about your game this week?

- Living up to your title.

- I scored a 93-yard touchdown.

School record, school record.

- Is that true? That's fantastic.

- It's Division Three.

It's Carlton football. It's not even

Division Two, it's Division Three.

- You got any friends, Andy?

- No.

- Oh, why is that?

- I don't know. I never saw the use.

Who are you gonna play with otherwise?

Lennon and McCartney were buddies.

Charlie Parker didn't know anybody till Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.

That's your idea of success?

Being the greatest musician of the 20th century is anybody's idea of success.

Dying broke and drunk and full of heroin at the age of 34 is not my idea of success.

I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34 and have people talk about me, than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remember who I was.

But your friends will remember you, that's the point.

None of us were friends with Charlie Parker. That's the point.

Travis and Dustin, they have plenty of friends and plenty of purpose.

They'll make great school board presidents.

You think you're better than us?

- Catch on quick. Are you in Model UN?

- I got a reply for you.

You think Carlton football is a joke?

Come play with us.

Four words you will never hear from the NFL.

- Who wants dessert?

- Heard from Lincoln Center?

Okay, get out of here. Pick up the new chart by the door on your way out.

Rehearsal 9 p.m. sharp tonight.

That's how long you have to learn it.

- Neiman. Stick around a minute.

- Mm.

- See the tempo marking on there?

- Uh...

"Quarter note equals 330." Oh.

That is a double-time swing.

- That's what got you in here, right?

- Oh, yeah.

As fate would have it,

I recently stumbled across another kid in the practice room working on his double-time swing.

So I'm gonna give him a shot.

- Am I late?

- Perfect timing.

Come on in, Connolly.

- Uh, you two know each other, right?

- Yeah, Nassau band.

What's up, Andrew?

I've made Neiman a temporary core, but with this competition coming up

I just wanna make very sure this chart is in the best shape it can be.

Yeah, this one right here, right?

I gave Connolly the chart this morning.

All I wanna do is give you both a crack at it, all right?

So, Neiman, go ahead, jump on the kit, take it from the top.

Okay.

I don't want you to worry about hits now.

Just tempo, okay?

All set?

One, two...

Not quite my tempo.

Connolly.

- I can take it from the top.

- Connolly, go ahead.

- I can do...

- No. We'll go with Connolly now.

Hey, do you mind?

- Okay, man, ready?

- Mm-hm.

One and two and...

- Perfect, Connolly.

- Oh, my God.

See, this to me is the beauty of Studio Band.

You walk in here an alternate, you could be the new core.

- Oh, my God, are you serious?

- Thanks.

That shit?

Fletcher.

Thanks, man. Here you go.

Don't worry about Fletcher.

He's more bark than bite.

Hey, look, you...

I can play these charts.

- Now is not the time, I swear to God.

- I can play it, okay?

I said not now!

If you want the fucking part, earn it.

I'm just gonna lay it out there.

This is why I don't think we should be together.

And I've thought about it a lot, and this is what's gonna happen.

I'm gonna keep pursuing what I'm pursuing.

Because I'm doing that, it's gonna take up my time.

I'm not gonna be able to spend time with you.

Even when I do, I'm gonna be thinking about drumming.

About jazz, my charts. Because of that, you're gonna start to resent me.

You're gonna tell me to ease up on the drumming, spend more time with you.

I'm not gonna be able to do that.

I'll start to resent you for even asking me to stop.

We're just gonna start to hate each other.

It's gonna be ugly.

And so for those reasons,

I'd rather just, you know, break it off clean.

Because I wanna be great.

And you're not?

I wanna be one of the greats.

And I would stop you from doing that?

Yeah.

You know I would stop you from doing that?

You know that for a fact?

Yes.

And I'd barely see you anyway?

- Yeah.

- When I see you, you'd treat me like shit because I'm some girl who doesn't know what she wants.

You have a path, you're going to be great, I'm gonna be forgotten, and you won't be able to give me the time of day because you have bigger things to pursue.

That's exactly my point.

What the fuck is wrong with you?

You're right.

We should not be dating.

I'm okay. Thanks.

Fuck! Fuck!

Fucking piece of shit!

Fuck you!

Fuck!

Fucking piece of shit!

Come on!

Um...

Sorry, we have a new player.

Ryan Connolly.

Um... Ahem.

I'm sorry.

Guys, just put your instruments down for a minute.

Just listen for a minute.

Six years ago...

I came across a kid in a practice room working on his scales.

He was early second year and he'd started at Shaffer with a lot of hope.

Like all you guys.

But the truth was that he barely squeaked in to begin with...

And he was really struggling.

The faculty were all telling him,

"Maybe this isn't for you."

But they didn't see what I saw.

This scared, skinny kid cursing himself because he couldn't get his scales right.

I saw a drive in him.

And I put him in Studio Band.

And when he graduated,

Marsalis made him third trumpet at Lincoln Center.

A year later, he was first.

That's who you're listening to now.

His name was Sean Casey.

I found out this morning... that Sean... died yesterday... in a car accident.

And I just...

I wanted you guys to know he was a beautiful player.

I just thought you should know.

I'm sorry.

Okay.

Let's get to work, huh?

How about "Caravan," bar 105?

Two bars for free.

One and two and...

It's not quite right, Connolly.

Um...

I'd like to try Neiman on this.

Maybe now's the time for Neiman to earn the part.

One and two and...

Nope, I guess not. Tanner?

One and two and...

Motherfucker!

Connolly, get your ass back on the kit.

We will stay here for as long as it takes until one of you faggots can play in time.

One and two and...

Looks like that might be all night.

Neiman.

One and two and...

Not my fucking tempo!

Sorry, guys.

Hate to put you through this.

If you need to fucking take a dump or get a coffee, whatever, now might be a good time.

We're gonna stay until I find a drummer who can fucking play in time.

I apologize to the musicians.

Seriously, take 10, 20, a fucking hour.

You hear me, cocksuckers?

Better start shitting me perfect 400s.

Connolly, get your fucking ass back on the kit.

Is that really the fastest you can play, you worthless Hymie fuck?

No wonder Mommy ran out on you.

Get off the fucking kit.

And here comes Mr. Gay Pride of the Upper West Side himself.

This is not a Bette Midler concert.

We will not be serving baked Alaska, so just play faster than you give hand jobs, will you please?

One, two, one, two.

Not even fucking close.

Let's go with the Irish Mick

Paddy cracker now.

You know, you actually do look quite a bit like a leprechaun.

I'm gonna start calling you Flannery.

Get off!

What are you looking for?

There's no gold down there.

Adjusting the seat? Really?

That's been your problem the whole time? The seat height?

So now you have it, right?

Go.

Bullshit! Fuck you!

Neiman.

Maybe it's time to finally bring this home.

What do you say?

Show me.

Don't slow down.

Pick it up.

Faster!

Faster!

Faster!

Faster!

Faster!

Keep playing!

Keep playing! Keep playing!

Keep playing!

Don't stop.

Neiman, you earned the part.

Alternates, you wanna clean the blood off my drum set?

Okay, we can start now.

5 p.m. call tomorrow in Dunellen.

Give yourselves at least two hours to get there this time, all right?

Save your travel receipts.

Or don't. I don't give a shit.

- Do you know where the cabs are?

- You gotta call the cabs.

- The cab was supposed to be here.

- You gotta call. They take forever.

How do I get to Hargrove?

Hey. Come on. Please, come on.

You're still open.

You're still open. Come on.

Come on. Come on.

Yeah, hello?

Neiman, where are you, man?

Call time was 5.

I know, I know. I'm almost there.

I'm right there.

- We're on-stage in 20.

- I know.

- Fletcher's got Connolly warming up.

- God fucking da... Okay.

You just tell that little fucking redhead I'll...

I'm gonna be there, okay?

Fuck.

Hey. Hey. Sorry I'm late.

Well, glad you could fit us into your busy schedule, darling.

I'm sorry I'm late.

I'm ready to go.

- Connolly's playing the part.

- Like fucking hell.

What the fuck did you say to me?

It's my part.

It's my part and I decide who to lend it to.

Usually it's somebody that has fucking sticks.

I left them in the car.

I'll be right back. Five minutes.

I'm warming up the band now.

- I can use Ryan's sticks.

- Neiman, you lost the fucking part.

No, I didn't. You can't do this.

- Can't?

- Yeah.

When did you become a fucking expert on what I can do,

- you fucking weepy-willow shit sack?

- I earned that part.

You never earned anything.

You are a self-righteous prick.

The only reason you're a fucking core is because you misplaced a folder.

Only reason you're in Studio Band to begin with is because I told you what I'd be asking for in Nassau.

- Am I wrong?

- Yeah.

I'm in Studio Band because I'm the best...

Back off.

Hey, fuck off, Johnny Utah.

Turn my pages, bitch.

Hey. I can cut you any fucking time I want.

- You would've cut me by now.

- Try me, you fucking weasel.

At 5:30, that's in exactly 11 minutes, my band is on-stage.

If your ass is not on that stool with your own sticks in hand, or if you make one fucking mistake, one, I will drum your ass back to Nassau where you can turn pages until you graduate or fucking drop out.

By the time you're done at Shaffer, you'll make Daddy look like a success story.

Got it? Or we can let Johnny Utah play the part.

- You choose.

- That's my part. I'll be on your stage.

- Fuck you.

- You got 10 minutes, you fucking pathetic, pansy-ass fruit fuck.

- Tell Fletcher I'm coming.

- What's taking you so long?

We're moving on-stage.

I got locked in my car. I'm coming.

Left turn, 200 feet.

- Are you driving?

- No.

What the hell was that noise?

Okay, why don't you just tell Fletcher that I'm coming, you motherfucker?

Hey. Hey, hey.

Are you okay?

Are you okay?

- I gotta get my sticks.

- No, stay away from the car.

- I've called 911.

- Look, I gotta go.

- No, no, sir.

- A couple more blocks.

- Sir, no, you don't have to...

- Please get off me.

Hey, guy.

What the fuck happened to you?

The Shaffer

Conservatory Studio Band.

Neiman, what the fuck?

Fuck.

Neiman...

You're done.

Gentlemen, ladies, I apologize on behalf of Shaffer

Conservatory.

Piece of shit.

I'll fucking kill you.

- Fuck you.

- Get the...

Get the fuck off me.

Get off me. Fuck off.

Fuck you.

Fuck you!

Fuck you, Fletcher!

Fuck you!

Get off. Fuck.

Piece of shit!

Fuck you!

When did you start talking to her?

Your father got in contact this week.

Does the name Sean Casey mean anything to you?

You know of his death?

Last month, he hanged himself in his apartment.

What does that have to do with me?

He suffered from anxiety and depression.

His mother claims this started during his time as Fletcher's student.

Now, the Caseys aren't wealthy, they don't wanna file suit.

So, what do they want?

To make sure Terence Fletcher is never allowed to do this to another student.

Hey, Dad, look at my paradiddle.

Yeah, that's my boy.

- He didn't do anything.

- What is wrong with you? It's over, okay?

He's out of your life.

Why would you let him get away?

Would you characterize his conduct as extreme, Andrew?

Did he ever intentionally inflict emotional distress?

This would not be a public hearing, you know.

Fletcher would never know it was you who spoke up.

Why would you do this to me?

Do you think that I would let him put my son through hell and then just walk away scot-free?

Don't you know

I would never let that happen?

That there is nothing in the world more important to me than you?

Don't you know that?

Andrew?

Andrew?

Just tell me what to say.

Hey.

I'd give anything to be there again this fall.

I like weddings, provided they're not mine.

Marriages are very healthy.

Married men live much longer than bachelors.

They're trying to outlive their wives so they can be bachelors again.

Haven't you thought of getting married?

I did.

The young lady changed her mind at the last moment.

I've been deeply indebted to her ever since.

And I loaded the pantry up with Gushers.

- Saw that.

- Okay.

All right.

Thanks.

Right on, man.

Andrew.

Hey.

I don't know if you heard. Uh...

I'm not at Shaffer anymore.

Yeah, I did hear that.

Did you quit?

Not exactly.

Some parents got a kid from Sean Casey's year, I think, to say some things about me.

Although why anybody would have anything other than peaches and cream to say about me is a mystery.

Yeah.

- That's a good laugh, right?

- I'm sorry.

- No, listen... I get it.

- I'm sorry.

I know I made enemies.

I'm conducting a little, though.

They brought back the JVC Fest this year.

They got me opening in a couple of weeks with a pro band.

That's great.

Yeah. It's all right.

Truth is,

I don't think people understood what it was I was doing at Shaffer.

I wasn't there to conduct.

Any fucking moron can wave his arms and keep people in tempo.

I was there to push people beyond what's expected of them.

I believe that is... an absolute necessity.

Otherwise, we're depriving the world of the next Louis Armstrong.

The next Charlie Parker.

I told you about how Charlie Parker became Charlie Parker, right?

- Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.

- Exactly.

Parker's a young kid, pretty good on the sax.

Gets up to play at a cutting session, and he fucks it up.

And Jones nearly decapitates him for it.

And he's laughed off-stage.

Cries himself to sleep that night, but the next morning, what does he do?

He practices.

And he practices and he practices with one goal in mind, never to be laughed at again.

And a year later, he goes back to the

Reno and he steps up on that stage, and plays the best motherfucking solo the world has ever heard.

So imagine if Jones had just said,

"Well, that's okay, Charlie.

That was all right. Good job."

And then Charlie thinks to himself,

"Well, shit, I did do a pretty good job."

End of story.

No Bird.

That, to me, is an absolute tragedy.

But that's just what the world wants now.

People wonder why jazz is dying.

I tell you, man, and every Starbucks "jazz" album just proves my point, really.

There are no two words in the English language more harmful than "good job."

But is there a line?

You know, maybe you go too far and you discourage the next Charlie Parker

- from ever becoming Charlie Parker.

- No, man, no.

Because the next Charlie Parker would never be discouraged.

Yeah.

The truth is, Andrew...

I never really had a Charlie Parker.

But I tried.

I actually fucking tried.

And that's more than most people ever do.

And I will never apologize for how I tried.

I'll see you later.

Yeah.

Hey, Andrew. Listen, I have no idea how you're gonna take this, but the band I'm leading for JVC, my drummer is not cutting it.

You understand what I'm saying?

No.

I'm using the Studio

Band playlist.

You know, "Caravan," "Whiplash."

I need somebody who really knows those charts.

What about Ryan Connolly?

All Connolly ever was to me was incentive for you.

- Tanner?

- Tanner switched to premed.

I guess he got discouraged.

Hey. Uh...

Take the weekend.

Think about it.

- Hello?

- Hey, Nicole, it's Andrew.

- Hi.

- Hey.

It's been a while since I talked to you.

Um...

Look, I...

I'm really sorry about everything.

I know that's not, you know, enough, but I'm just really sorry. Um...

But anyway, I got...

I actually have this show this weekend.

It's a, uh...

Like, a JVC thing. And I didn't know if maybe you'd wanna go, and we, you know, maybe get some, like, pizza afterwards,

And, like, complain about our schools again.

What is...?

You said Jayvees?

No, it's, heh, JVC.

It's like a...

It's a jazz thing.

Yeah.

Oh, okay.

Well, I don't know if I can come. I...

I'll have to check with my boyfriend.

Okay.

Yeah.

Yeah, I'll check, but I don't know.

I don't really think he likes jazz music.

Yeah, I mean, it's not for everybody.

Okay. Well, I guess maybe I'll see you guys there.

- Okay.

- Okay.

Bye.

All right, gang, listen up. Now, for those of you who are new at this, which looks like everybody except Cal, tonight could change your life.

The folks out there make a phone call, you could be a Blue Note signee, an EMC client, a Lincoln Center core.

On the other hand, if you drop the ball, you might be looking for a new line of work because the other thing about these cats is they never forget.

We all set?

All right. Let's have fun.

You think I'm fucking stupid?

- What?

- I know it was you.

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

We're very excited to be here kicking off the JVC Festival this year.

I'm Terence Fletcher, these are some of the best musicians in New York, which means they're some of the best musicians in the world.

We're gonna do some old standards, but we're gonna start with a new tune by Tim Simonec called "Upswingin'."

What the fuck you doing?

Come on, man.

Yeah, I guess maybe you don't have it.

That was a little extra avant-garde there from the rhythm section.

Come on, let's go home.

What are you doing?

Uh...

Now we're gonna slow it down a little bit.

I'm guessing most of you folks have heard...

I'll cue you in.

"Caravan."

Three, four.

I'm gonna gouge out your motherfucking eyes.

- Andrew, what are you doing, man?

- I'll cue you.





# Capote

Hello?

Nancy?

Exactly.

But at least be honest about the facts.

-That's what l'm saying.

-Who's honest? l'm honest. l am honest about what l write about. l'll let you know if it's autobiographical, or if it's about me, or if it's not.

And l find autobiographical stories at this juncture of my life to be quite boring.

...say l'm one thing, but actually you're another thing. l think being true to who you are is important. l'm not saying you need to be psychoanalytical about the whole mess.

-But don't be afraid.

-Yeah, l... But don't be afraid. l had lunch with Jimmy Baldwin the other day.

-How is he?

-He's a lovely man.

And he told me the plot of his new book.

And he said to me, "But l just want to make sure it's not one of those problem novels."

And l said, "Jimmy,

"your novel's about a Negro homosexual who's in love with a Jew.

"Wouldn't you call that a problem?"

And he looked at me and he laughed because he knew l was right. l'm saying, you know, if you're gonna write something like that at least be honest why you're writing it.

Can't we just be honest?

Well, l don't think you actually need to be honest.

But don't come asking some white man from the South whether your book about a black man fucking some Jew, when they're both of the same sex, is an issue!

Don't ask me that!

Oh, no, it's not an issue, Jimmy.

Everyone's gonna be quite pleased with that topic.

So how about you, Truman?

Do you admit it?

Well, l'm not nearly that controversial. l'm not! l'm not! l am not. l'm not nearly that controversial.

Oh, come on.

Hi. lt's Truman for William Shawn, please.

Have you read the article about the killings in Kansas in the front section of The New York Times? l think that's what l want to write about. l want to go tonight.

-l figured you'd missed it.

-l'm sorry.

That's all right. l thought l was heading to Kansas by myself.

God, l'm glad you agreed to come.

You're the only one l know with the qualifications to be both a research assistant and a personal bodyguard.

Thank you.

Now l'm nervous.

Yes?

Mr. Truman Capote and Miss Nelle Harper Lee?

-That's us.

-Where would you like these, sir?

You can put that right there between the doors.

What all did you bring?

Just a few things.

-Thank you greatly, sir.

-Thank you.

You're welcome. lt's an honor to have you with us, sir, and l hope you won't mind me saying, but l thought your last book was even better than the first.

Thank you. l mean, just when you think they've gotten as good as they can get.

-Thank you very much.

-Ma'am.

You're pathetic.

-What?

-You paid him to say that.

You paid him to say that.

How did you know?

"Just when you think they've gotten as good as they can get?" l thought that was a good line.

-Do you think that was too much?

-Yeah, a bit.

Your keys.

-Sign here, please.

-Thank you.

Alvin Dewey,

Kansas Bureau of lnvestigation.

KBl.

Hi. l'm looking for Alvin Dewey.

Hi.

Mr. Dewey.

Truman Capote, from The New Yorker.

-Bergdorf's.

-Sorry?

-The scarf.

-Oh.

-Nice.

-Thank you.

Mr. Dewey, l wonder when we could arrange an interview, some time to talk.

About what?

Well, we're not looking for any inside information.

You know, l don't care one way or another if you catch whoever did this. l'm writing an article on how the Clutter killings are affecting the town.

You know, how you all are bearing up. l care.

-Excuse me?

-l care. l care a great deal if we catch whoever did this.

Oh, l see.

-As do a lot of folks around here.

-Oh, of course.

Do you have press credentials?

-What's a New Yorker?

-Magazine.

Magazines don't give out...

You can come to the news conference with the rest of them.

Sears, Roebuck.

The boy was 1 6?

He was 15.

Nancy was 16.

And it's her friend that found them?

-Laura Kinney.

-Can you spell that?

I assume you're okay with the Laura part.

K-l-N-N-E-Y.

But, pIease, Ieave her be.

There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans.

A whole bunch of Mexicans.

Hello, George.

It's good to see you again.

I do have an opinion whether this was the work of one man or "a whoIe bunch," as you said, but it doesn't matter a whole lot whether it was Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos.

We're gonna find whoever did this.

Now, four good peopIe from our community are dead.

So let's remember that.

The West Kansas Farm Committee is offering a $1,000 reward for information Ieading to an arrest.

PIease print that.

And thank you aII for coming.

He was foxy with that old man.

This make you miss Alabama?

Not even a little bit.

-You lie.

-l don't lie.

-Good morning.

-Hi.

Can any of you tell me where l'd find Laura Kinney? ls that her? With the boy?

Yeah, with Danny Burke.

Danny Burke?

Laura?

Thank you.

Truman. l'm gonna find out where that girl lives.

Can l do that alone?

All right?

Okay.

I think I scared a friend of yours this morning.

She came looking for you when I was writing.

-You hate my friends.

-No, I wouIdn't say "hate."

Just as long as they don't knock on my door. l saw the bodies today.

-Which?

-The Clutters. l looked inside the coffins.

That's horrifying. lt comforts me.

Something so horrifying... lt's a relief.

NormaI Iife faIIs away.

But then, I was never much for normal life.

No.

Yeah, people here won't talk to me.

They want someone like you, like Nelle.

Me, they hate. l can't think of a single quality l share with Nelle.

-Well...

-Maybe manliness.

-Good morning, Henry.

-Good morning, sir.

Let's go.

Bye.

Hi, Danny. l'm Harper Lee.

Nancy was your best friend?

Yeah, she was my best friend.

How has Danny been?

Pretty shattered.

Nothing terrible has ever happened to him before.

Danny was the last one at the house that night.

That's why Mr. Dewey keeps interviewing him.

They don't think that he had anything to do with it. lt's just to see if he remembers anything unusual.

People in town do seem to wonder if he was involved.

Yeah. That's been really hard for Danny.

Oh, it's the hardest when someone has a notion about you and it's impossible to convince them otherwise.

Ever since l was a child, folks have thought they had me pegged because of the way l...

The way l am.

You know, the way l talk.

And they're always wrong.

You know what l mean?

Yeah. l wanna show you something.

Maybe this will give you a better picture of what happened.

-What is this?

-lt's your diary.

"Danny here tonight and we watched TV.

"So nice just having him sit with us.

"Left at 1 1 :00.

"P.S. He's the only one l really love."

And that was that.

Did Laura say "shattered"?

"Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible has ever happened to him before."

You know l have 94% recall of all conversations?

94%? l've tested myself.

Well... how did that happen?

Apparently Detective Foxy's wife has read fiction.

That's great.

We're in.

-We are in.

-ln.

-You came.

-Hi.

-Thank you for having us.

-Thank you.

Get yourselves in here.

Alvin, get your pants on. They're here.

-Hey, little Deweys.

-Hi.

Hi.

Shake it with your wrist.

Use your whole arm.

More.

You think l'm kidding around, but l'm serious.

Mama would've put in half the bottle.

She had to buy it by the crate.

Alvin's gonna hate this. l have to stop.

Oh, l cannot believe you're from New Orleans. l miss it so much.

Well, l only lived there for a short while, but my mama was born and bred.

You know something?

Alvin pretends he doesn't know who you are, but the minute you came to town

-he read your books.

-No!

He had one of his men pick up

Breakfast at Tiffany's in Kansas City

'cause it's banned in the library here.

And he said, "l feel like you're spiting me." l said,

"Do you think l took this job to spite you?" l was writing the script as they were filming, all that time in ltaly and l'd work like mad all day long and then dash down to the bar around midnight to hand in the next day's scenes.

And Humphrey had just about moved into the hotel bar...

Humphrey Bogart.

...where he and John...

John Huston.

...had...

They drank every night.

And l mean drank, you know, like famished water buffaloes.

Well, l'd only just handed them the final scene when the bellhop told me l had a phone call.

And it was my stepfather, Joe Capote, calling to say that my mother had died. l flew home to New York, terribly distraught, but when l got to the apartment l could see that Joe was in even worse shape than l was.

He grabbed my hand and he said to me

"Talk.

"Talk about anything." You know?

"l mean, any subject in the world.

"Don't worry whether it'll interest me or not.

"Just talk

"so l won't break down."

He couldn't bear to be alone with his thoughts. lt was too painful. lt's been a hard couple of weeks for Alvin.

He and Herb Clutter were good friends from church.

Oh, Marie.

Oh, come on, Alvin. These are good people.

Why would they put a pillow under the boy's head just to shoot him?

Why would they tuck Nancy in?

So many of my friends would love to meet you.

-Oh, that'd be fine.

-You don't have to worry

'cause l'm not going to write about this till everything's over.

Well, l'm not worried. l know what room you're in at the hotel, and l know where you live in Brooklyn.

You're celebrating.

WeII, remember NeIIe's manuscript she sent me in New York?

Yeah. Mockingbird. KiIIing a Mockingbird.

-You said it was good.

-And I was right.

She just heard

Lippincott wants to publish it.

Well, Jesus.

Jesus, well, that's terrific.

Tell her congratulations from me.

Congratulations.

-Thank you.

-Jealous.

-Will you be home by Christmas?

-l wanna come home.

I wanna come home. I do. I just thought if they catch whoever did this, who knows what?

-l'll probably be here till next Christmas.

-l'm gonna let you go. l...

No, don't go.

We'll go away next spring to write.

-Maybe Spain.

-Yeah.

-Okay, l'm gonna let you go.

-Jack...

Jack, l promise.

We'll go away this spring to write.

-Maybe Spain.

-Okay.

AII right.

My wife worked there, too.

What did she do in the house?

Cleaning. Cooking a little bit.

Quiet, quiet. Quiet, quiet.

"Girdle up. No extra bulges.

"lf you're dressed right, when he gets home

"the rest of the evening should be smooth sailing.

"Bon voyage, gals." l can't believe you got that whole page. l only read it once.

-l've tested my...

-Tested myself.

-l have 94%...

-Percent recall.

-Cut that out.

-Cut that out.

Cut that...

Cut that out. lsn't that something, Alvin?

Oh, it's impressive.

Thank you.

-l'm sorry. He's upset.

-What's he upset about?

They know who did it.

Two men.

You know, they passed through Kansas City last week writing bad checks.

By the time Alvin's boys got up there, they were gone.

Skipped out.

Yeah. They don't know where.

No idea.

One of them had a cellmate who gave him up for the $1 ,000 reward.

Do they know the name of the cellmate?

No. No, l don't know. Alvin knows. l guess this isn't the appropriate time to go ask him.

He's beside himself.

Hello?

Alvin, get in here.

-Dad, it's the telephone.

-Not now, Alvin.

God damn it.

Get over here.

-Dad!

-Alvin, not now.

Sit.

Dad? Dad?

You need to call the Chief of Police in Las Vegas.

-Alvin, what'd you say?

-He said you need to call them immediately.

-Truman Capote.

-Dorothy Sanderson. l figured you'd be left alone this morning by that hardworking husband of yours so l have breakfast, and l have news, and l have literature.

My friend, Jack, mailed me that book you wanted and l inscribed it myself.

"To the maiden of the Midwest, the priestess of the plains,

"the queen of the kitchen, my first novel. Truman."

-You're too much. Come on in.

-Oh, thank you.

Go into the living room. Have a seat.

Let me get that. lt's been ringing all morning.

Hello?

Truman, l meant in here.

That's the women's cell. lt's hardly ever used, but they wanted them separate.

Let's sit in the living room.

They put you in the women's cell.

Do you have any aspirin?

My legs.

Truman?

Please. l'm sorry. ln the matter of the State ofKansas v. Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry Edward Smith this court has been informed by counsel, Mr. Weeks, that the defendants wish to waive their right to a preliminary hearing.

His mind is somewhere else.

Mr. Hickock, is that your wish?

Yes, sir.

Why are they doing that?

Mr. Smith. l ask that the waiver be effectuated.

"Effectuated?"

So noted.

Remove the prisoners.

Was it your choice to waive the hearing?

Do you still need some?

Give me your hand. l could kill you if you got too close.

Now, would you like some water, or...

Mrs. Sanderson lent you my book.

He said we'd curry favor with the judge if we waived our rights.

Who did?

The lawyer.

Your picture's undignified.

People recall first impressions.

What's been your first impression?

Hello.

-Mr. Shawn.

-Truman. l'm writing a book.

It's too much for a singIe articIe.

This town, the killers most of all.

You will be stunned by Perry Smith.

Why, what's happening?

Well, not much yet, but l know. l can sense him.

He's desperateIy IoneIy, frightened.

I have a question.

Are you ready?

-Would it matter?

-No.

How much more money can you send me?

And how quickly could you get Dick Avedon out here to take some pictures?

Who are you smiling at right now? l'm smiling at you.

You know, Dick's a very famous fashion photographer.

World-famous.

Am l gonna be in a fashion magazine?

So there's no worry of having a bad picture.

Who were you closer to, your mom or your dad?

-What's that?

-Who were you closer to,

-your mom or your dad?

-Well, both.

-Yeah?

-Yeah.

-Have you talked to them?

-Yeah.

Who'd you talk to first?

Perry, honey, you look terrific, baby.

That was good.

Can you show us the tattoo on your chest then?

Yeah.

Where did Perry get the art set?

Members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?

Yes, sir.

Defendants, rise.

Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene Hickock, you stand accused of four counts of the crime of murder in the first degree.

Have you reached a unanimous verdict?

We have, Your Honor.

What is your verdict?

Guilty on all four counts.

Have you unanimously reached a sentence?

We have, Your Honor.

What is the sentence?

Death. l need to see him before we go.

Perry.

They're going to transfer you up to Lansing today.

You'll have to make sure to put me on the visitors list.

Otherwise l can't see you. l'm going to help find you a proper lawyer.

You need a serious lawyer for an appeal.

Now they took Dick Iast night.

And I need you to get him to do the same thing and just put me on the visitors Iist.

And l thought, "Where does the family eat?"

You know? l mean, does he, like, reach his hand through the bars and have dinner with everyone around the table?

Nelle, kudos on... KiII the Bird, is it?

-That's close. Thank you.

-That's marvelous. Who's your publisher?

-Lippincott.

-Yes. lt's a children's book, right?

-Yes.

-No, no. lt's about children.

-Yes.

-Yes, l've heard a lot about it.

-Good.

-Congratulations.

-Thank you.

-l didn't even know she wrote.

He's sad and he's shy.

And he's terrified.

They shotgunned the entire family in the face.

And l thought, at first,

"l'm gonna be scared of these men.

"l'm gonna run, run right home."

Actually, the brother in the family,

Kenyon is his name, they had placed a pillow under his head and then shot him point-blank in the face.

Almost as if they were putting him to sleep, and then shot him.

This is the start of a great love affair.

Yeah. Truman in love with Truman.

The book l'm writing will return him to the realm of humanity. lt's the book l was always meant to write.

Well, he hasn't actually written a word of it yet, but he says it's the nonfiction book of the decade, so...

So, what have you been doing?

And l'll tell you, l was in Marilyn's apartment just last week, talking about movies, art.

Finally l had to break it to her that of the four Matisses hanging on her wall, two were upside down.

Can l have another, please?

To answer your question, l'm following Breakfast at Tiffany's by blazing a different path.

By inventing an entirely new kind of writing.

The nonfiction novel.

-You have a subject?

-Yes.

On the night of November 14, two men broke into a quiet farmhouse in Kansas and murdered an entire family.

Now, why did they do that?

Two worlds exist in this country.

The quiet, conservative life, and the life of those two men.

The underbelly. The criminally violent.

And those worlds converged that bloody night.

Now, l spent the past three months interviewing everyone in Kansas touched by that violence.

Now l spent hours talking to the killers and l'll spend more.

'Cause researching this work has changed my life.

You know, it's altered my point of view about almost everything.

Yeah.

And l think those who read it will be similarly affected.

So you find them a new lawyer.

Well, they're facing execution in six weeks.

You know, they need someone to argue whether or not that's right.

Okay.

And l'd also like to see them alive.

-Well...

-Yeah.

Yeah, l need to hear their stories.

Well, just be careful what you do to get what you want. l'm finding them a lawyer.

-Truman, you're finding yourself a lawyer.

-No, l'm finding them a lawyer.

There's a difference.

The Warden will see you now.

Well, we do all right by our boys.

Showers once a week. Feed them good.

We'll be feeding Perry Smith in the infirmary soon if he don't eat.

Try and get the food in through his arm. l'm sorry, what are you talking about?

Well, he hasn't eaten in a month. lt ain't his right to kill himself. lt's the right of the people.

The people of this state.

And that's who l work for, the people.

-No one told me.

-Yeah, he won't eat.

-When can l see him?

-Well, let me see.

How about you coming 3:00,

Thursday afternoon?

No.

That's no good. l need to see them now.

Then whenever l want, for as long as l want.

Well, that's just not how we do things around here, Mr. Capote.

Yeah, l understand what a burden unlimited visitation might be on this institution and on the people who pay for it.

And l want to be clear that l don't expect the citizens of Leavenworth County to have to shoulder that burden.

This is to be dispensed as you see fit.

You know, l didn't know where to count your boy at first, him being half-lndian.

But l did him a favor. l counted him as a white man.

You're a kind and generous man.

Spread your feet.

This way.

-Hey, hey.

-Yeah, hello.

Hey, thanks a lot for your help with the lawyer.

Oh, that's fine.

Wow. You must be really desperate for a story to come all the way out here.

You want to go see Perry, go ahead.

Thank you.

You want my advice, though, Mr. Capote, he's just trying to prove the insanity defense. lt's okay. lt's Truman. lt's your friend. lt's okay.

This is before she had us.

Before she started drinking.

Who took care of you as a child?

Orphanage.

Me and Linda.

And that's your sister?

You know, we're not so different as you might think.

Yeah, l was abandoned repeatedly as a child.

My mama would drag me along to some new town so she could take up with another man she'd met.

Night after night, she'd lock me in the hotel room alone.

Mama would turn the latch and tell the staff not to let me out no matter what.

And l was terrified.

And l'd scream my head off until finally l'd collapse on the carpet next to the door and l'd fall asleep.

Then after years of this she just left me with relatives in Alabama.

Who raised you up?

My aunts.

And that's where l met Nelle.

And she lived next door.

Your mother was lndian?

Cherokee.

So drinking was not a good thing for her.

No tolerance for it.

We're on suicide watch.

That's why they leave the lights on at night. l hope we're past that now. l do.

Be careful of Ricardo. l think he wants you all to himself.

All right.

But he's naturally mendacious.

Not to be trusted. lf he had $1 00, he'd steal a stick of chewing gum.

Perry, l want to take your notebooks with me. l want to read them. lf l leave here without understanding you the world will see you as a monster, always. l don't want that.

'Cause he trusts me. l mean, that's why he gave it to me.

And he's given me absolutely everything.

And he wants so badIy to be taken seriousIy, to be held in some esteem.

Do you?

Do l what?

Do you hoId him in esteem, Truman?

Well, he's a gold mine.

And he's told me his entire life.

His dead mother.

He had a brother and a sister kill themselves.

Awful.

Did you tell him your mama did the same thing?

See, l can't tell him everything.

We've been taIking our heads off for the past month.

And sometimes when l think how good my book can be, l can hardly breathe.

Anyway, this is what l wanted to read to you.

"lf called upon to make a speech"...

"lf called upon to make a speech?" l mean, this is exactly what l'm talking about.

A speech, just in case he's ever recognized for an achievement.

"l can't remember what l was going to say for the life of me.

"l don't think ever before have so many people been so directly responsible

"for my being so very, very glad.

"lt's a wonderful moment and a rare one.

"Thank you!"

There's an excIamation point at the end of that "thank you" in case you didn't catch it.

Where'd you go? l guess it stopped being funny. l never said it was.

Wait, listen to this. l was 14.

One day l said to her, "Mom's dead." l could see it.

A week Iater we got the news.

She finally drunk herself...

Found her shivering...

She hit me so many times with that flashIight, she broke it.

That night,

I dreamed about that big yeIIow bird.

Clawed that nun's eyes, bright like the sun.

Lifted me to the sky.

Sometimes you see a thing how it really is.

Well, you're nothing if not hardworking.

Hey, you look good. Healthy again.

You know, l've decided on a title for my book. l think you'll like it. lt's very masculine. ln Cold Blood. lsn't that good?

And that refers to the crime or the fact that you're still talking to the criminals?

The former, among other things. l see. l wanted to ask if you'd let me look at your investigation notes.

That lawyer you helped find for your friends got them a hearing at the Kansas Supreme Court... l heard this morning.

...on the issue of inadequate counsel.

Alvin, l mean, do you not want me to look at your notes?

You are permitted to say no. l'll tell you what. lf those boys get off, l'm coming to Brooklyn to hunt you down. l have to be in court at 9:00 but you call Roy Church and he'll show you what you want to see.

Thank you. lt's as much for me as for anyone. l couldn't bear the thought of losing you so soon.

We're gonna be able to use your book for our case.

You'll write we never got to raise an insanity plea.

You wrote how terrible the lawyers was. l haven't written a word yet.

What have you been doing?

Research. Talking to you.

All right.

-l had hoped...

-What are you calling it?

The book? l have no idea.

Perry, if l'm going to write about you, if l'm going to determine how to write about you, we need to talk about, you know, why you're here.

You know, the murders, and that night, at the Clutter house.

Do you worry what l'll think? ls that it?

Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor. l know a lot of people.

Perry, l have invitations to be in Morocco, Greece, and l prefer to be here, with you.

Jack, be patient with me. l'm just missing this one piece.

WeII, how Iong is that gonna take?

Why don't you just try Ieaving him aIone for a while?

Come to Spain.

You can aIways visit him Iater. l don't know.

WeII, I'm off. I'm just...

I've got my own writing to do.

Well, do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.

There's too many peopIe around. I've... l'll leave the address on the kitchen table.

Well, think about what I said, and join me when you can. l will.

-l will.

-Okay?

Bye.

Hi.

Truman.

We never intended on killing that family.

Capote, will you get that straight in your book, please?

No premeditation.

What are you doing? l have to fly back East.

When?

An hour. l miss you already.

Write me every five minutes.

Hey, you know, we never did intend on killing that family.

Capote?

What?

Truman,

I've not been abIe to tear myseIf away from your book.

It's that good.

It's not good, it's astonishing.

-This first haIf is astonishing.

-Oh, thank you.

When wiII you be done, do you think?

Yes, l'm already well into the third part.

But l can't finish that till l convince Perry to describe the night of the killings to me. l was planning to visit this fall, see?

Then I think you need to taIk to him now.

And we all need to see how this ends for the final part. l can't finish the book till l know what happens. lf Perry and Dick are executed, it's one thing.

And if not, well...

Truman, you got your ending. l really don't know.

The Kansas Court denied their appeal.

It came over the wire on Friday.

I mean, you need to taIk to Perry now.

He'll be dead by September.

I mean, I'm sorry. l know how much you've come to care about him.

Right. Yes, right.

So l want to set up a reading for you in the fall, in New York, and, well, we'll build some interest, and we'II pubIish in the faII.

Thank God. There's nothing in the house.

Why aren't you working?

Well, l knew you couldn't be counted on to stock the kitchen.

What are we going to feed our famous guest?

Oh, Jesus, l completely forgot.

Plus, l finished my novel yesterday.

What?

When was the last time you wrote to him? l don't know.

What's this? lt's a letter for Truman l was asked to deliver. lt's from Perry.

Let's have it.

"Dear friend Truman, where are you?

"Read this item in a medical dictionary.

"'Death by hanging is caused by asphyxia,

"'by fracture of the cervical vertebrae,

"'by laceration of the trachea.'

"Not too comforting, as we lost our appeal.

"Missing you.

"Alone and desirous of your presence.

"Your amigo, Perry."

Mr. Shawn told me about the court decision yesterday. l was wondering why you were in such a good mood.

That's a terrible thing to say. l write him all the time. l've just... l've been so focused on the book lately.

So Jack thinks l'm using Perry, but he also thinks l fell in love with him when l was in Kansas.

Now, how both of those things can be true is beyond me.

Thank you.

Well, did you?

Did you fall in love with him? l don't know how to answer that.

Truman. lt's as if Perry and l grew up in the same house, and one day he stood up and went out the back door while l went out the front.

-Are you kidding me?

-No.

Listen, you be nice to Jack.

Sometimes l think he's what l like about you best. l'll see you at the reading in New York.

-1 6th.

-1 6th.

Adiós.

What was he in jail for?

Well, they said it was for not paying his taxes, but really, for being an outsider.

Refusing to go along.

Lowell, you're being moved.

-Why?

-You're going to final holding.

No.

Come on, Lowell. Open the door.

Stand up.

-Put your arms behind your back.

-Okay, last chance.

Get up.

Turn around.

Put your arms behind your back.

Now Dick and me, we're next in line. l'm so sorry l've been away. lt was a long time. l know.

How's the book coming along?

Very slowly.

Will you show it to me? l've hardly written anything.

Good evening, New Yorkers, and thank you for coming to the first pubIic reading, the first offering of any kind, of Truman Capote's new work, ln Cold Blood.

Hello. My name is Truman Capote.

For this evening's program,

I'm going to read some passages from the first three parts of my new book.

"The viIIage of HoIcomb stands on the high wheat pIains of western Kansas,

"a lonesome area that other Kansans call 'out there.'

"UntiI one morning in mid-November, 1959

"few Americans, in fact, few Kansans, had ever heard of Holcomb.

"Like the waters of the Arkansas River,

"Iike the motorists on the highway,

"exceptionaI happenings never stopped there.

"Perry Smith's voice was both gentIe and prim.

"A voice that, though soft,

"manufactured each sound exactIy,

"ejected it Iike a smoke ring issuing from a parson's mouth.

"The four coffins, which quite fiIIed the smaII, flower-crowded parlor,

"were to be sealed at the funeral services,

"very understandabIy,

"for the effect was disquieting.

"Nancy wore her dress of cherry-red veIvet,

"her brother a bright pIaid shirt.

"The parents were more sedateIy attired,

"Mr. Clutter in navy-blue flannel, his wife in navy-bIue crepe.

"And it was this especiaIIy that lent the scene an awful aura,

"the head of each was compIeteIy encased in cotton.

"A swollen cocoon twice the size of an ordinary bIown-up baIIoon.

"And the cotton,

"because it had been sprayed with a gIossy substance,

"twinkled like Christmas tree snow.

"One Tuesday at dawn, a carload of strangers,

"ignorant of the IocaI disaster,

"were startIed by what they saw as they crossed the prairies

"and passed through HoIcomb.

"Windows ablaze.

"AImost every window in aImost every house,

"and in the brightIy-Iit rooms, fuIIy-cIothed peopIe,

"even entire families,

"who had sat the whoIe night wide awake, watchfuI, Iistening.

"Of what were they frightened?

"It might happen again."

Thank you.

And l slipped and l ripped a hole, from the bottom of my scrotum all the way up to the top of the crack of my ass.

And l sat there.

And l didn't know it. All l felt was a... l didn't know it. All l felt was a cool breeze, you know, between my...

Sorry. lf l may...

Yes.

Your portrait of those men was terrifying.

Terrifying.

Thank you.

Stop that man! Come back here!

Dad!

Have any of you met my father?

He hasn't spanked me in years.

George didn't come backstage.

He had... He had a...

Something that his wife had to rush him off to.

-But he made a point of...

-Well, l'm still waiting for a call. lt was beautiful.

And everybody came. Everybody came.

-Tennessee loved it.

-Of course he loved it.

Should we do more?

No, we just sit and wait while people talk about it, and we let them do the work. l mean, this book is going to change everything. lt's gonna change how people see your writing. l think it's going to change how people write.

-Are you gonna be finished by October?

-l think so.

You know, they're scheduled for next month.

To hang.

Yeah.

We're gonna commit as many issues as it takes to publish.

Whatever it takes.

Well, l'm going to Kansas tomorrow

-and l'll get Perry to talk.

-What's he got to lose?

Sorry, but...

Hey, this may sound strange to you but l'm going to miss him.

You'll be able to finish now.

Need to check your papers, sir.

This is what we've been waiting for.

A stay of execution to make a federal appeal.

All thanks to you.

Thank you!

They're not gonna corner me now.

Not unless the U.S. Government says so.

Kansas has had it in for me for 1 0 years.

They can't corner me now.

Hey, Perry, sit down for a minute. l need you to talk to me.

We've got all the time in the world to talk. l've been thinking about Ricardo.

You really need to stop sending him those trashy books. l won't even mention the pornography.

Now, l realize that Dick probably can't grasp the literature that you gave me.

And the books you send him only...

They only exacerbate the problem.

They only heighten or intensify it.

Maybe we can get him started on a program.

Perry, l know what "exacerbate" means.

Okay, well, just thinking...

There's not a word or a sentence or a concept that you can illuminate for me.

There is one singular reason l keep coming here.

-Truman.

-November 14, 1 959.

Three years ago. Three years.

And that's all l want to hear from you.

Now l asked you not to. Ever.

This is absurd.

Do you know what absurd means? l'm ready. l have a plane to catch. l found your sister in Tacoma.

Maybe she'll talk to me about something useful.

Please don't go out there.

Hey, this is my work, Perry. l'm working.

And when you want to tell me what l need to hear, you let me know.

June's dead. Frank shot himself.

Now Perry did what he did. l used to love him. He was my little doll.

He scares me now.

-When was the last time you saw him?

-Ten years ago.

Ten years.

Could l borrow one of these pictures?

Take the whole thing. l don't want them anymore.

Don't be taken in by my brother.

He's got this sensitive side he'll show.

You believe he's gentle and so easily hurt, but he'd just as soon kill you as shake your hand. l believe that.

Hello, handsome.

What's the name of your book? l don't know what you're talking about.

"Truman Capote read last night before a packed audience

"from his nonfiction book In CoId BIood. "

"The true-crime novel tells of killers Richard Hickock

"and Perry Smith,

"who brutally murdered a Kansas family three years ago."

-Wait, who sent that to you?

-That's not your goddamn business. lt is my business, because it's not true.

The organizers of the reading needed a title.

They picked one, a sensational one, l admit, to attract a crowd.

-They picked it?

-Yes.

-lt's not your title.

-Perry, l haven't chosen one yet.

How could l choose a title when we still haven't talked about that night?

How could l? l couldn't possibly.

You pretended to be my friend. l'm sorry. l should have told you.

And l couldn't pretend to be your friend,

'cause the truth is, l can't help wanting to be.

You don't have to tell me anything if you don't want to. l have something from your sister.

She misses you.

Look at my belly.

There must be something wrong with us, to do what we did.

We heard there was $1 0,000 in that house.

Once we tied up everybody and searched all over, l knew the guy that told us about it was wrong.

There was no money.

Dick wouldn't believe it, so he went tearing through the house, banging on the walls, looking for a safe.

When he was done he said he was gonna go up to Nancy's room and have his way with her. l wouldn't allow it.

And l told him that.

So l sat with her.

Dick came up and got me.

We turned off the lights and went down to the basement where Mr. Clutter and the boy was.

He kept saying, "No witnesses", but l figured if l waited him out, he'd...

He'd give up and we'd leave them tied up there.

And we'd drive all night.

They'd never find us.

We tied Mr. Clutter's wrists to a pipe over his head.

And he looked hurt, so l cut him down. l put a box out there so he'd be more comfortable.

He asked how his wife and daughter was and l said they were fine, and they were getting ready for sleep, and it wouldn't be long till morning when they'd find him.

He was just looking at me.

Looking into my eyes.

Like he expected me to kill him.

Like he expected me to be the kind of person who would kill him. l was thinking,

"This nice man is scared of me." l was so ashamed. l mean, l thought he was a very nice, gentle man.

And l thought so right up till l slit his throat. l didn't know what l did till l heard the sound.

Added up, how much money did you get from the Clutters that night?

Between $40 and $50.

I mean, the truth is,

I'm desperate to be done with it. l've spent four years of my life on this book.

They got a stay of execution yesterday.

Another, yes.

Supreme Court. lt's harrowing.

Me, all l want to do is to write the ending and there's no end in sight.

No, thank you.

"Dear friend Truman, haven't heard from you in such a long while.

"Please help find new lawyer.

"lf not, Dick will have to write the Supreme Court brief himself.

"Our last appeal.

What a pair of wretched creatures.

"Please help. Your amigo?"

"Perry."

Just put it with the others.

You know, at least for Nelle you should try and pretend you're having a good time tonight. l thought l'd find you here.

Oh, Nelle.

Thank you. l'll have another, please.

-How are you?

-Terrible. l'm sorry to hear that. l mean, it's torture the way...

What they're doing to me.

And now it's the Supreme Court.

And can you believe it? lf they win this appeal, l will have a complete nervous breakdown. l may never recover and l'll just pray that it turns my way.

-lt must be difficult.

-lt's torture.

They're torturing me. l see.

And how'd you like the movie, Truman? l frankly don't see what all the fuss is about.

Hello.

-Mr. Truman Capote?

-Yeah. l have a call from Mr. Perry Smith in the Kansas Correctional System.

WiII you accept charges?

Yes.

Mr. Smith, you're on the line.

Hello.

Hello?

Hello, Perry.

They Iet me make a coupIe of phone caIIs before I go down to hoIding.

You heard the Supreme Court rejected the appeal?

No, l didn't. l hadn't heard that.

Yeah. l'm sorry.

Yeah. They Iet me make two phone caIIs.

We got a date set for the warehouse,

Dick and me.

Two weeks and finito.

ApriI 14.

WiII you visit me?

Truman? lt's him again. lt is utterly inappropriate for me to talk to him.

Yes? l'm sorry, he won't be able to make it.

-Hello?

-Mr. Shawn, it's Nelle. l just got this telegram. Has he seen it?

He won't read it.

-WouId you put him on, pIease?

-Nelle, he won't talk.

Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him down and put the phone on his ear, l need to speak to him.

All right. lt's Nelle.

Truman.

"Miss Nelle Harper Lee and Truman Capote.

"Sorry that Truman was unable to make it here to the prison

"for a brief word prior to necktie party.

"Whatever his reason for not showing up,

"l want him to know that l cannot condemn him for it.

"Not much time left

"but want you both to know that I've been sincereIy gratefuI

"for your friendship through the years and everything eIse.

"I'm not very good at these things.

"I have become extremeIy affectionate toward you both."

"But, harness time."

"Adios, amigos. Your friend, Perry. "

Well, l didn't expect to see you again.

You can visit for a few minutes.

-Yeah.

-No.

Five minutes.

Well, well.

He returns. l don't know what you must think of me.

Well, you haven't been foremost on my mind lately as you can probably imagine.

You got the letter?

Yes, l did. lt's true. l understand why you didn't want to come. l wouldn't be here either if l didn't have to.

You got that right.

You know Ricardo donated his eyes to science?

Next week, some blind man will be seeing what Dick used to see.

Yeah, you could be walking in Denver or somewhere, Truman, and suddenly these eyes will be staring at you.

That would be something, wouldn't it? lt would be. lt would be.

You'll be watching? l don't know, l'll be...

Do you want me to? l'd like to have a friend there.

Okay. Then l will. lt's all right. l did everything l could. lt's okay. l truly did. l know. lt's time.

Mr. Capote.

Goodbye.

You're not rid of us yet.

-We'll see you in a few minutes.

-l wish l had...

Mr. Capote.

-Mr. Capote.

-Goodbye.

Nice to see you.

Perry Edward Smith.

For the crime of murder in the first degree, by order of the Court of Finney County, and the Supreme Court of the sovereign state of Kansas, you are sentenced to hang until you die.

"l will fear no evil: for thou art with me.

"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me."

You can say something if you want. ls there anybody from the family here?

No, Perry.

Well, tell them... l can't remember what l was gonna say for the life of me.

Our Father who art in heaven,

Hallowed be thy name.

Thy kingdom come,

Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread.

And forgive those who trespass against us.

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. lt was a terrible experience and l will never get over it.

They're dead, Truman. You're aIive.

And there wasn't anything l could have done to save them.

Maybe not,

How long is this gonna take?

That's really up to you.

Right, then.

I know how this bit goes.

My name is

Elton Hercules John... and I'm an alcoholic.

And a cocaine addict.

And a sex addict.

And a bulimic.

I'm also a shopaholic, who has problems with weed... prescription drugs... and anger management.

Why are you here now?

Well, my dealer was out of town.

I thought this seemed like a good alternative.

I'm here because

I want to get better.

What were you like as a child, Elton?

Reggie! You're late!

I've had to throw your dinner in the bin! Get inside.

Is he back?

What am I? Thin air?

Wouldn't get your hopes up.

He's very unreliable and very selfish.

But will you send him up if I'm already in bed?

Reggie! Move!

Got to get this done before I go out.

All right, all done.

Put it away before you go out.

Mum, I've got to go.

Where's my cardigan?

What?

Did I do something wrong?

Bloody hell, Sheila.

Maybe we should get him some lessons.

Love to. Get him out from under my feet.

Go on, play it again.

I want to play it for Dad.

Managed to drag yourself home then.

- Hello, Stanley.

- How are you, Ivy?

Like you care.

Come on.

You're letting in a draft.

How long you back?

I've got a couple of weeks' leave.

Reggie's not long gone to bed.

Go on. Pop up, say hello.

I'll see him tomorrow.

Any dinner left?

Or have you fed it all to that boy?

My dad was passionate about... family and music.

He'd talk for hours about jazz.

He was always hugging me.

I was very lucky.

I was actually a very happy child.

Dad, is it true you play piano?

I'm saving to get lessons.

If you want to sit in here, you'll have to be quiet.

I'm listening to my music.

I like this one, Dad.

Never, ever touch my collection without asking.

When are you going to hug me?

Don't be soft.

What are you still doing up?

Learning.

Turn off the light.

Go to sleep.

Crumbs! That was energetic!

Play another one.

The "Moonlight Sonata," Reggie.

Mum? My piano teacher thinks I'm good enough for a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music.

The Royal Academy of Music?

It has a nice ring to it.

"Royal."

Scissors.

- What do you think?

- The red one's good.

- It's only on Saturdays.

- I've things to do on weekends.

- Can't just drop everything.

- I'll take you.

- Where are you off to?

- Don't know.

Haven't decided yet.

But whatever it is, you're not invited.

Reggie's piano teacher thinks he's good enough for a scholarship.

Really?

You think he's got that kind of talent?

Of course, he has.

But you'd know that if you took the slightest bit of interest in me or this family.

Stop looking at that.

You're not a girl.

- Can we go home?

- Home? No going home.

This is your life.

You have to get over that silly shyness.

But Mum says I'll never...

Everybody's frightened at the beginning.

You play at being confident.

Life gives you very few chances, Reggie, and this is one of yours.

You show 'em you can be as good as they are.

Better. Number one.

You can do that, can't you?

- Yeah, I suppose.

- Good. Go on then. Here.

Here's for a bag of chips and your bus fare home.

Reginald Dwight?

- Yes.

- Hi. How do you do?

Good, thank you.

Take your coat off.

Did you not bring something to play?

Didn't know I had to.

I see. Well...

So, can you show me anything so I can get a sense of where you're up to?

Why have you stopped?

That's as far as you got.

You might have a good memory, and a good ear, but you've an awful lot of work to do.

So, wrists and back straight.

Let's start with the C-major scale, both hands, two octaves.

Hands off the table, Reginald.

Stop making that noise.

Hello, son. I'm Fred.

I'm a friend of your mum's.

You tied me down with that kid years ago, and now I've finally got a reason to leave and be rid of you and this bloody house!

He didn't even give me a hug goodbye.

He's no good at showing affection.

Never has been.

- I wish I was someone else.

- Oh, don't be silly.

Well, how do you think I felt?

I was a kid.

Heartbroken.

People don't care though, do they?

Anyway...

I'd discovered records.

And rock 'n' roll.

I know you like him.

He's quite a dish.

- I would.

- Oh, Mum!

Thanks, Mum. It's fantastic.

You serious about wanting to be a rock 'n' roller?

Yeah. Of course.

Better get you the proper haircut, eh?

- Can I get it cut like Elvis?

- Enjoy it while it lasts.

He's like my side of the family.

He'll be bald as an egg by the time he's 20.

Congratulations to Dave.

He's won four pork chops, half a pound of prime mince and a string of sausages.

Thank you all! Thank you!

Now, Sheila and Fred's boy is gonna sing us a couple of songs on the piano.

Reggie Dwight!

Come on, Reg!

Go on, boy.

Hello.

Bloody hell.

Have you got a fag?

Rubbish!

Reg, Reg, play the one I like.

Excuse me.

- You can't put that there.

- Bernie Taupin?

- Yeah. You must be Elton?

- Yeah.

- Hi.

Well, that's my stage name.

You can tell me your real name when we get to know each other better.

Right.

- Uh...

- Um...

- I was thinking... Sorry.

- Have you ever... Sorry.

No, no, please.

After you.

- I like your lyrics.

- Thank you.

Yeah, I got the tape you sent. It's great.

- Really good.

- Thanks.

Hang on. Don't bother with that one.

That wasn't supposed to be in there.

- That's sent by mistake.

- No, no, that's really good.

I wrote a tune to it.

- Yeah, I...

- "Border Song"?

Yeah. I read it and I could hear the whole tune in my head.

It was all there, I could see all the notes, and I just had to get it out.

It was like my fingers couldn't work fast enough to keep up with my brain.

Do you ever get anything like that?

Uh... not really, no.

But I can write more for you, though, Elton.

- I'll just send them down to you.

- Great. That'll be good.

Great.

My real name's Reg Dwight.

Cool. Yeah, that sounds like a cowboy name.

Yeah, all I ever...

All I ever wanted to be was a cowboy, you see.

Do you like country and western music?

- Yeah.

- It's good, isn't it?

Have you heard "Streets of

Laredo" by Marty Robbins?

Mmm.

That's good.

- Am I supposed to be impressed?

- It's catchy, Dick.

These guys are special.

I've got an instinct for these things.

All right, don't break your neck sucking your own cock.

Maybe we could put these two into a little beat combo.

He's the good-looking one.

We'll make him the singer.

Oh, no, hold on. I'm tone-deaf.

Elton is... He sings the songs.

Yeah, I could just take those songs and leave, if you like.

Whoa, all right, no offense.

Don't get your knickers in a twist.

They are writing a lot of great tunes, Dick.

There is one that's perfect for Lulu.

Easy, tiger.

You... You flatmates?

No, we live with our mums.

So I do the writing,

I send it down to him, and then he adds the music.

Who ever heard of songwriters not living together?

Yes, Lennon and McCartney are inseparable.

- How many songs you got?

- Um, hundreds.

Ray says you're an investment.

But Ray knows fuck all.

You're a couple of pricks as far as I can tell.

So quit that backing-band nonsense, find a place to work together, and write me tunes that gray-haired old tramps'll whistle in the street.

You never know.

One day, you might have enough for an album.

Do that, and I'll put you on ten quid a week.

- Hello. I'm Bernie.

Who ever heard of a rock star with the name Bernie?

Lovely.

So what are your plans now... Elton?

Not too sure.

Written a lot of songs, haven't we? Enough for an album.

And Elton's got himself a girlfriend now.

Arabella, our new landlady. Yep.

So what about rock 'n' roll?

What about hot chicks and cocaine orgies?

What about fame and fortune?

What about the fact that you're a fag?

A what?

Your little friend is a homosexual.

No, I've got a girlfriend.

When's that ever stopped anybody?

Are you?

Don't know.

Would it matter if I was, Bernie?

No, not to me.

Might matter to Arabella, though.

- Yeah, mate, I'd agree on that.

- Have you met her?

Fuck.

- No, no, Bernie.

- What?

What is it now?

What am I gonna do?

You're going to tell her.

It'll break her heart.

Not sure she has one.

Would you please keep the noise down?

You'll wake up the whole bloody street!

- Come on.

- Yeah.

There's so much that we gotta do.

There's worlds to conquer.

I mean, America.

Wide open spaces.

Tower Records.

Listen, the songs are great.

And people keep asking. They're, like,

"Who's that singing on the demos?" And I...

You are a shit-hot piano player, you have an amazing voice, and I'm telling you, there is something special that happens... when you sing our songs.

You heard what Dick said.

He said my hands are like midget boxers.

Who cares what Dick thinks.

I just don't know if I'm... what they're looking for.

It's time for you to be out front.

I love you, man.

I do, but... not in that way.

Yeah.

Elton, time for bed.

We became inseparable after that.

The brother I never had.

Do you know, in 20 years, we have never had a single argument. Not once.

Anyway, I took his advice, told Arabella.

She took it very well, actually.

You bastard!

She's killed my piano.

You treacherous beast!

Your music's as shitty as you are!

Hi, Mum.

I knew you'd be back.

You'll have to pay rent.

I'm not made of money.

- Morning.

- Good morning.

- Get dressed, Reggie!

- Elton.

I'm not having you moping around here all day.

We're songwriting.

Oh, yeah?

Looks like it's going well.

Right. I will not have a mess in this house.

It's nice and tidy, and that's how I want it to stay.

I'll not have a doss house around here.

I can't do everything.

I can't cook and clean and wash.

Rely upon me to do everything.

It's not fair.

There's egg on this.

I'd better go take a shave, I think.

Trans-fucking-Atlantic!

Always knew you boys could do it.

First thing I'm gonna do is put you on a three-album deal.

- Three?

- A year.

And I got you a couple of nights at the Troubadour.

- Doug Weston's an old friend.

- Hang on. The Troubadour?

- It's this really cool folk club in LA.

- Yeah, we know what it is, Ray.

Hang on. Now, let's not be hasty, because the thing is,

I haven't even got a backing band yet.

No, I've sorted the backup band, don't worry.

Dick, I don't wanna appear ungrateful, but you can't just spring the Troubadour on me.

Look, it's time to do something bold, Elton.

Granted, America's a bit of a gamble, and you fuck up and I'll kill ya.

But Ray'll go, too.

He'll keep an eye on you.

Buy yourself some new clothes.

Get something flashy.

Let 'em know who you are.

Put on a great fucking show, and just don't kill yourself with drugs.

Yeah?

Yeah, all right.

I'm gonna have a massage.

Good to see you, Doug.

Ray.

How are you?

So good to see you, man.

What'd you bring me?

Hey, Doug. Bernie.

Nice to meet you.

- Hi, Bernie.

- Good morning.

- Hi. I'm Elton.

- Oh.

Sweet. How are you?

Monday night at the Troubadour, man.

It's gonna blow your mind.

Be totally packed.

You're gonna love it.

It's a bit different from what I expected.

Yeah?

Yeah, it's just a bit smaller.

Well, size is everything, my friend.

Neil Young played here last week and there were people lined around the block.

Man, it was just...

It was the best night ever.

- That's a cool hat.

- Yeah?

- You like it?

- I do like it, yeah.

- I won that hat, in a bet.

- Oh.

- With Bob Dylan.

- Really?

- Yeah.

- That's cool.

Elton. This is the band.

I'm just gonna check they know what they're doing.

So, you want something to drink?

Get these guys whatever they want.

They just flew in from England and, boy, their arms are tired.

Whoa, dude, what the hell are you wearing?

My stage gear.

Where's Reggie? Where's Reggie?

Reggie, Reggie, Reggie.

Neil Diamond is at the bar.

He's talking to Leon Russell and half the fucking

Beach Boys. Huh?

Jesus, shit, Bernie!

Reggie?

- Elton. I think you're overreacting.

- No.

Bernie, you are under-reacting.

They are the geniuses of American music.

I can't go out there in front of that lot!

Okay, okay. Then we'll tell Doug to refund everyone's ticket,

- and we'll send everybody home.

- Where is he?

- Hey, Ray.

- You've signed a contract!

Dick's paid your fucking airfare!

Now get out there and play, you little twat.

Well, come on then.

And now, ladies and gentlemen, a rising star in rock and roll.

Please welcome, all the way from London, England,

Elton John.

John Reid.

Elton.

I know it all seems a bit overwhelming at first, but something makes me think you'll get used to it.

In fact, I predict you could be the best-selling artist in America if you desire.

So you like the song then?

Not quite as much as the singer.

You don't realize what happened at the Troubadour tonight, do you?

Look, I'm in music management, and let me tell you, there are moments in a rock star's life that define who he is and how people perceive him as he ascends into the heavens.

You lit the blue touch paper.

Now we can all see you shooting light and color and... magic into the night sky.

Where there was darkness, there is now you.

Elton John.

You can do anything you want.

You can be anyone you want.

And it's gonna be a wild ride.

Our review from the LA Times has been syndicated.

- Okay.

- Things are going crazy. I've extended our stay.

We're in San Francisco tomorrow for three nights.

- Ray, slow down.

- After that we fly to NYC, then we're back here for two more shows, and then...

Dick wants us back in London to start the new album.

- Doug.

- "Rejoice.

Rock music has a new star.

He's Englishman Elton John, a 23-year-old, whose debut at the Troubadour was, in every way, magnificent."

Whoo!

It's happening, guys.

Just remember, when you get back... four shows you owe me.

- You said...

- Four.

Did... You said four shows?

- Yes.

- That's not gonna work!

So... will I see you when I get back?

Now, don't worry about me.

Go and enjoy your moment.

- That's what's important.

- Come to London with me.

I can't, but, uh...

But next time I'm there,

I'll look you up. Promise.

Hey, I've opened the fucking house.

Don't be a bummer.

I'm gonna watch out front.

Ah! I love 'em.

These are extremely stylish boots of my own design.

Can you even play the piano in those?

- It's never gonna last.

No one's getting phased out, Dick.

Elton feels things will run more smoothly if he has personal management.

- There's never been a problem before.

- And there isn't one now.

Look, there's loads of work and commitments, tours, etcetera.

That's what I'll be doing, personal management.

- Taking care of things.

- Is that right?

You realize I've got a contract with Elton.

I've had that looked into, and my client is quite entitled to take on outside representation.

And you. You're happy with this arrangement, are ya?

Right?

After all these years?

It's nothing personal, Dick.

Come on, Ray.

Best of luck to you, Elton.

Your very expensive painting is upside down.

- After you, Mr. James.

- Thank you, Raymond.

Well... that was absolutely horrible.

Don't worry, it's business.

Dick's a big boy, he'll be fine.

Mr. Reid, Lord Grade's office have called about the Royal Variety Performance.

Apparently, the Queen Mother is a big fan.

Couldn't we have kept on Ray?

He's such a lovely guy.

"Lovely guy" is not a job.

This is a crucial time,

Elton.

You and I are gonna have to be more careful,

'cause the papers have been sniffing around.

We can't give them anything to speculate on.

I'm thinking of getting someone in as your girlfriend.

- Doesn't that seem a bit excessive?

- No, no, no, no, no.

This is your career and our business at stake.

If our sleeping arrangements get out...

- all of this is gone.

- Right.

And you're gonna have to talk to your parents.

Make sure they know what to say.

Those are the first doors reporters knock on.

- Hello, Reg.

- Hello, Dad.

Well, come on in.

Well, those are very fancy shoes.

Oh. Yeah.

I brought you something.

Why are you here, Reg?

The boys.

Dad, there's a Rolls-Royce outside.

Stephen, Geoff... this is your brother, Reggie.

Half brother.

Not actually called

Reggie anymore.

Hmm.

I thought maybe once I'm back from touring, you and I could get together, if you like.

I could get you some tickets to my next concert.

Not really my thing.

Is it true you're worth 25 million pound?

Do you know,

I don't actually know.

They're really proud of you. Mmm.

Yeah, we've even got some of your records.

Why don't you go and get the album?

Grab us a pen.

You probably get asked this all the time, but would you...

Would you mind signing this?

Yeah, of course.

Oh, no. Would you make it out to Arthur?

He's one of the blokes from work.

Yeah, he's a big fan.

- Is he?

- Mm-hmm.

Perfect.

Right.

Well, looks like things worked out really well second time around, Dad.

- I suppose they have.

- Mmm.

'Cause, you know, not everybody gets a second chance.

The boys loved meeting a real-life pop star.

Sure. Thanks, Dad.

Bye.

- When I grow up, Dad...

- Get inside.

What are you doing without your shoes on?

You're gonna be a draftsman.

Back inside.

What have you got to do to get a fucking drink around here, eh?

Will you stop sulking?

It has to be done whether you like it or not.

Are you gonna be scared of her your whole life?

Right, stop the car.

- Elton...

- I said, stop the car!

You're onstage in 15 minutes.

You're the big-shot manager.

You make my excuses.

Tell them I'm indisposed, breaking my mother's heart!

Elton. Elton!

Drive 'round, Denis.

Liberace!

Pinner nine, seven, double-five.

- Mum, it's me.

- I know who you are.

Well, I've got something to tell you.

Reggie, we're gonna miss the bit of the show with you on.

Look, shut up, Mum!

I'm not on telly yet, am I?

I'm talking to you.

I...

Me and John, we...

Well, the thing is...

I'm... a homosexual.

A poofter.

A fairy.

A queen.

Well, say something.

Oh, for God's sake,

I know that.

Known for years.

- You don't mind?

- Frankly, I don't care.

But I'd rather you keep that sort of thing to yourself.

I just hope you realize you're choosing a life of being alone forever.

You'll never be loved properly.

Right. Got to go.

She said I'll never be loved.

Don't ever put me in this position again.

You're onstage in 10 minutes, so get over yourself and do the show.

We're running a business here, you fucking idiot.

Don't ever put your hands on me.

Real love's hard to come by.

So you find a way to cope without it.

- You okay?

- Yeah.

Got the number-one album in America. Again.

I'm about to embark on the highest-grossing tour in rock history.

I'm personally responsible for five percent of all record sales on the entire planet, and I have the biggest headdress known to man.

So, yeah,

I think I'm okay, Bernie.

It used to just be the two of us.

Now there's busloads of people just to do the music.

Hang on, hang on, don't you wanna just go out there and sing without this ridiculous paraphernalia?

You know, just be yourself, Reg?

Why the fuck would I want that, Bernie?

You wouldn't say this shit to me if you were a real friend.

People don't pay to see Reginald Dwight.

They pay to see Elton John!

Don't ever tell me how to do my fucking job!

Break a leg.

You don't have to put up with this, Reg.

Write the fucking lyrics,

Bernie!

Let me deal with the rest.

- I'm sorry.

- I know.

Ladies and gentlemen!

Please welcome Elton John!

- Where am I?

- At your house in LA, Mr. John.

Right.

I'll put some coffee on.

Darling, I've been thinking, maybe we should quit the booze for a couple of days, take some quality time together...

Afternoon.

Mr. Reid.

- What are you doing, John?

- Just a bit of rock 'n' roll.

Rock 'n' roll is not shagging your secretary in front of the pool boys!

Rock 'n' roll is getting you out of your bed in the morning.

Arranging 250 gigs in 26 different countries.

Rock 'n' roll's actually

112 employment contracts, insurance, copyright indemnity, renegotiating your previously insane contracts and wiping your arse.

You know, all you do, Elton, is play the piano.

But for me, rock 'n' roll is an 87 million-dollar-a-year industry.

Maybe I just play the piano, but you know what else I do?

Hmm? I pay, John.

For everything.

Including this house, which I'd like you to leave now.

You may still be my manager, but you and me are finished.

- You're so predictable.

- No, not predictable.

I want to be by myself, not with some asshole who doesn't give a shit about me and takes the piss day after day!

- Get out!

- Yoo-hoo!

Elton.

What are they doing here?

You told me to hire a jet and fly them over for the gig.

- No, no, next week, John.

- It is next week.

I'm gonna go and fetch them a drink.

Darling, why don't you clean yourself up, because you fucking stink.

Sheila! It's been too long.

- Beautiful woman.

- Hello, look at this, you lovely lot.

- Here we are.

- Hi, Nan.

- I can't believe I'm actually in America.

- I know.

- Hi, Dad.

- How you doing? Good to see you.

- Elton.

- Hello, Mum.

Elton, darling, you remember the Andersons

- from next door, don't you?

- Yes, the Andersons.

How could we forget the Andersons?

- Hello.

- Hello.

And what a shy little boy you were.

Look at you now.

Elton, you must give them a tour.

- Yes, right now, go on.

- Yeah, okay.

Everyone,

Elton is giving a tour.

- Mum, you're on my gown.

- Don't be rude.

Here we go.

Come here, come here. Excited?

- Car.

- Yeah.

- Bernie, how's it going, man?

- Hey, man. How's it going?

No idea who he is.

Of course.

Here he is!

Ladies, Elton.

- Hey.

- Hey.

What are you doing on your own up here?

Miserable bastard.

You're missing all the fun downstairs.

Well, as long as all the fun isn't missing me, then who gives a shit, Bernie?

We should get a drink.

- No, we should. Let's go get a drink.

- Come on, it's fine.

No, we absolutely should.

No, I'm telling you...

Yeah, go and get a little drink.

You look amazing.

Fucking prick.

For my next trick,

I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

Elton.

- Elton.

- Yes, sorry. You were saying?

I was saying that I think I need a break.

You need to take a break?

I think that I just need to go and sort myself out a bit.

What?

I'm going home... for a while.

Well, that's nice for you.

Why can't we just, you know, both of us just disappear together?

My ranch.

We'll go to my ranch, we'll hide away.

We can write like we did.

Like we used to.

We should go home, Elton.

Reconnect.

No, you should go.

There are other writers

I'd like to work with anyway.

Do me good.

Collaborate with other people.

I just hope you realize you're choosing a life

You'll never be loved properly.

When are you going to hug me?

Don't be soft.

Life gives you very few chances, Reggie,

- and this is one of yours

- Who are you?

You can do anything you want.

You can be anyone you want.

What do you really want?

And what a shy little boy you were.

Look at you now.

What do you really want?

I'm going home... for a while.

What do you want? I'm busy.

Why don't you get back in the studio you're paying for?

Why don't you sell my fucking records?

What's this? Hmm?

Number 11 in Italy.

The song doesn't work, that's the problem.

The record's coked-out MOR shit.

No, the problem... is you have never understood me... and what I have to go through.

And you know what?

I should've sacked you when you left me.

I am glad I left you.

It means I can maintain some objectivity in your self-indulgent, myopic little world.

Get in the studio and make some music or don't.

I don't care.

Well, you will when your money runs out.

Do your worst.

In fact, take me to court.

You signed contracts with me years ago.

So I'll still be collecting my 20% long after you've killed yourself.

Fuck off!

I'm sorry.

I know.

Renate didn't deserve that.

She's a good person.

I dragged her into all my madness.

Did being married make you happy?

Not really. I'm gay.

- I think...

- Hello, Mum.

- Sir, would you like me to...

- Maybe a bit later, thank you.

- Hi, Dad.

- Hello, son.

- You all right?

- Yeah. Good.

Just talking about poor Renate.

Such a lovely woman.

Divorce can be so painful.

- Yeah.

- Anyway, celebration is in order.

We found a lovely villa by the sea.

It'd be good if you would talk to John today, get the money arranged.

Can't risk losing this one.

Yeah, in Minorca.

It is a lovely place.

You should see it.

- Minorca, eh?

- Mmm.

What do you want to go there for?

- Because you're driving me away.

- Mmm.

Every time we open a paper, there's something about you and the booze or the drugs, and... you're breaking your poor mum's heart.

Tell you what,

I'll write you a check. Hmm?

So she can go buy a new one.

Typical that you'd say something like that about me, when I've given up so much for you.

What have you given up for me?

Your father... for a start.

You really are a heartless monster.

You know, I don't live my life in black and white.

And I do not want your fucked-up, frigid ideas about anything.

You know, I am so sick of running away from who I am.

There's nothing wrong with success. Or pleasure.

In fact, why am I apologizing for it?

Mum, I have fucked everything that moves.

And I've taken every drug known to man.

All of them.

Do you know what?

I enjoyed every last minute of it.

Ever since you first dangled your fat little legs in front of a piano, you've been lucky.

You've never worked hard for a bloody thing in your life.

It all just comes to you.

You don't do anything.

And I'm the one who suffers.

I should never have had children.

Do you know how disappointing it is to be your mother?

- Excellent choice.

Where's Reid these days?

Uh...

Well...

Does it matter?

Hates my fucking guts.

Nobody hates you, Elton.

Campaign to kill yourself is going well.

What are you doing here,

Bernie?

Hmm?

You left when it suited you.

Now you come back to lecture me?

'Cause the thing is, the first time we actually got anywhere, you left, didn't you?

Some girl was more important to you than me and all those legends who were welcoming us in.

You left me at the most important time, Bernie.

When did you give up?

If you don't care about yourself, how do you expect anyone else to?

Whenever I needed you most...

- you weren't there.

- It's not weak to ask for help.

I have worked my balls off to get us out of the shit.

Day in, day out, for years.

And now it's me that can't walk down the streets.

It's me who doesn't have a life.

'Cause I don't get to sit around with my feet on a desk, chewing on the end of a fucking pencil.

"Write the lyrics, Bernie.

I'll take care of everything else."

That was a test!

You should've known.

- Thank you.

For as long as I can remember, I've hated myself.

Believed I'd never be loved.

Shows progress to take responsibility for your actions.

Yeah, but I started acting like a cunt in 1975.

I just forgot to stop.

I do feel ashamed.

Spent so long feeling resentful for things that just don't matter.

Maybe I should've tried to be more ordinary.

Hello, Nan.

You was never ordinary.

Look at you.

In here, talking about your feelings.

What a waste of time.

Mum, I know it was never easy.

And I hope you can forgive me.

Because I've realized that's what we need to do now.

Forgive each other.

- No, your problem is you're selfish.

- No.

My problem was I believed you loved me.

And you're incapable of it.

I gave everything to keep something that I never even had in the first place.

I always thought you was an introverted extrovert.

- A what?

- He's shy. He's always been shy.

It's all his father's fault.

Don't blame me.

He'd have been strange, regardless.

Actually, I think

I'm okay with "strange."

God. Not him.

Both of you. Stop.

I'm not going to allow you to talk to me like this anymore.

It's about time you said that.

Bernie.

I never told you how much I need you.

No, no, no, I love you, man.

Always have, always will.

You write songs that millions of people love.

And that's what's important.

You just need to remember who you are... and be okay with it.

He doesn't know who he is.

Yes, I do.

I'm Elton Hercules John.

I thought you were Reggie Dwight.

I haven't been

Good to see you.

Some days are tougher than others, but I feel good.

They got a piano here?

- You been playing?

- Hmm...

- No.

- No?

Not in the right place for that just now.

I'm scared, Bernie.

What if I'm not as good... without the drink and the drugs?

You know that's not true.

You're not scared you're not good without it, you're scared to feel again.

You might be able to lie to yourself, but you can't lie to me.

I should be going.

Don't go.

Not yet.

This is the part you gotta do on your own.

These... need music.

Thank you, Bernie.

You're my brother.

- [children laughing]

- [footsteps running]

[Mae Ray] Betty, get out of the way.

[Janis] "She put her arms around his neck" and hung there as he opened her trousers.

Then he placed both hands behind her buttocks and lifted her.

"She gave a little hop..."

[Marsha] Like a bunny?

- [laughter]

- Hey, y'all.

[laughter stops]

What do you want, Betty?

Are y'all reading

Lucy and Sonny at the wedding?

It's so dirty.

No.

Mama and Daddy wouldn't like you reading this.

You're too young.

[chuckles]

My favorite part is,

"Her hand closed around an enormous blood-gorged pole of muscle."

[chuckles]

It's not a muscle.

Janis, your little sister is such a weirdo. God, I know.

[Kitty] Betty, come on over here and help me with these beans.

[men shouting in distance]

[Mammaw scoffs] Would you listen to those fool men?

[cabinet closes]

[Butch] Why don't

I chop some celery?

You can probably use it in your casserole.

[Mammaw] Oh, casserole's done, Butch, but here, you can pour that bacon grease out of the skillet into the

Luzianne can right there.

Well, how heavy is that skillet?

I have bursitis in my good arm, you know?

Really?

[Neva] Why don't you just let me handle it, Aunt Butch.

We wouldn't want you messing up your good arm.

Well, thank you, Neva, honey.

What was it that happened to your bad arm?

[Butch] Honey, don't you remember?

The Christmas before last,

I slipped.

I got a hairline fracture in the metacarpal bone in my right hand.

[Mammaw]

I didn't remember that.

It just swole up like a balloon.

[Bullet imitating engine noises, whooping]

[Mammaw] Get those young'uns out of here!

It's a hot stove, and I don't want nobody to get burned!

Bullet, Mae Ray, listen to

Mammaw. Come on, go outside.

Betty, take these kids outside.

Come on, y'all.

Let's go outside.

What in the world is the matter with that child?

I mean it, Bullet.

I'll slap you so hard,

- your clothes will go out of style.

- [men hollering]

- Ah, what'd I miss?

- [toilet flushing]

[laughs] - Hey, y'all know what's good for you, you won't go in there for a while. All right.

Gross, Daddy.

[Daddy Mac]

All right. Oh, goddamn it.

Move! Move. You're in front of my Falcons game. Move.

Bullet, Mae Ray, get.

Y'all, let's go outside.

[Daddy Mac] Get!

Bullet, Mae Ray, get.

Get the hell out of here!

Goddamn it!

I'll whup you both with my handsaw!

Jesus Christ.

[Betty] Bullet! Mae Ray!

[birds and insects chirping]

[Betty] I was always happy when my Uncle Frank came for one of his rare visits.

Sit down.

Nobody else in my family ever seemed interested in me.

You ever read Madame Bovary?

No, I haven't.

But Uncle Frank was different.

He was a college professor, and he lived in New York City.

He used aftershave.

His fingernails were always clipped.

And he wore a gold chain underneath his shirt.

[laughing]

I could listen to him talk all day.

[Betty] Oof, well, um, supposedly...

He was the only adult that I knew who looked me in the eye...

[laughing]

I like...

I don't like...

...who was curious about what I had to say...

[indistinct]

...and who liked to make me laugh.

And in the summer of 1969, when I was 14... that was exhilarating.

[both laughing]

[Daddy Mac] I'll open this one right here. Get ready.

Here we go. Oh!

Thank you, Marsha.

A man can always use an extra pair of socks.

Oh, well, it's from me and Tee Dub.

Happy birthday, Daddy Mac. I hope you don't mind me calling you that.

Hey, you gonna be a member of this family, you'd better call me Daddy Mac.

[laughter]

Open another one!

Bullet! Enough, goddamn it!

Hey, now.

That's how you handle a rambunctious child.

[sniffs]

Thanks.

Well, that one's wrapped up so nice, it must be from Frank.

[Daddy Mac]

Oh. Must be.

[Butch] What is it?

[Kitty] Wow!

An electric shoe polisher.

You think I'm too old to polish my own shoes, need a goddamn machine to do it?

Of course not. No, I...

It's... I have one.

It's just faster and easier.

Next!

[chuckles]

Well, I sure do appreciate your gift, Frank, since I'm the one who always ends up polishing your daddy's shoes.

Hm.

Thank you, darling.

[Mike] Here you go, Daddy.

That's from me and Kitty.

[Daddy Mac]

Ooh, look at that.

Aw, look.

It's a little, itty-bitty screwdriver.

It's a glasses repair kit for when you lose a screw from your frames and whatnot.

[Daddy Mac] Yeah, well,

I could use these a lot.

I'm always fixing my reading glasses.

Thank you, Mike, Kitty.

- [Kitty] And Janis.

- [Daddy Mac] Mm-hm.

- And Betty and Bullet.

- Yep.

[Bullet]

Happy birthday, Daddy Mac!

[laughter]

[Betty] I never knew why Daddy

Mac was so mean to Uncle Frank or why nobody else ever said anything about it.

[laughter]

[Mike] Well, okay.

[yells]

Can I go to the bathroom?

[Butch] Yeah, if you promise to wash your hands.

[Betty] I might understand if Uncle Frank was selfish or rude or snobby, but he wasn't.

He was smart and funny and considerate.

He was the kind of person

I wanted to be.

But he was the one Daddy Mac picked on and belittled in front of everybody.

Uncle Frank was good at hiding how much it hurt him, but I could see it.

[chattering continues]

Uncle Frank, what is it like living in New York City?

Oh, I love it.

See, once you get out of a town like Creekville, not only do you see how small your world was, you also see how much bigger it could become.

In ways you never even thought possible.

Can I come visit you sometime?

Yeah. Sure.

If your parents agree to it.

Of course they won't.

They wouldn't even let me go to majorette camp.

Well, Daddy, he said, no daughter of his was gonna prance around half naked in front of the whole town.

I'd probably end up getting raped, and you know what,

I would deserve it.

He said that?

Mama says it's just the beer talking.

How are your grades, Betty?

All A's.

All A's, huh? No B's?

Mm, no. [Chuckles]

Good. Keep that up.

Ace your SAT.

You could get a scholarship to just about anywhere you want to go.

Oh.

Probably just go to SC State like most of my class.

Ah, come on, now.

You gonna be the person you decide to be, or are you gonna be the person everyone else tells you you are?

'Cause you get to choose.

You do.

I wish I wasn't named Betty.

It's a lady name, and I'm only 14.

So change it.

[laughs]

I can't just change my name.

You can do anything you want.

What about "Liz"?

[scoffs]

No?

"Liza"?

"Betsy"?

[laughs]

Uh, maybe "Beth"?

Yeah, I like "Beth."

And there are so many things a Beth can accomplish besides being a majorette.

My cousin Marsha's a majorette.

Yes, she is, and please don't do what your idiot cousin Marsha did.

She got herself pregnant, and now she's gonna have to marry that imbecilic young man.

Marsha's pregnant?

Shh.

If ever you need me to pretend to be your father so you can get birth control,

I will be more than happy to do that.

Look at me.

And if you do find yourself getting knocked up, you call me first before you talk to anyone else in this family.

I promise.

Okay.

You want me to leave

Madame Bovary for you?

Oh, that would be great.

[chuckles]

Thank you.

[man over speakers]

Attention, new students.

Please allow our student ambassadors to show you around the NYU campus.

These student-led tours depart every half hour.

Uh, Bledsoe.

First name Beth.

Uh, Elizabeth.

I'm sorry.

Thank you.

[Kitty] That was scrumptious.

Wasn't that scrumptious?

Charlotte!

What was that salad?

Oh. It's called tabbouleh.

I never thought to put rice on a salad.

Oh, no, that's bulgur.

What's vulgar?

[Frank] Uh, uh, bulgur.

It's made from a wheat.

[Mike chuckles]

Sure was interesting.

That smells so good.

[Charlotte chuckles]

What is it?

Oh, it's beef.

[Frank]

Lamb.

It's sfeeha.

[Charlotte] That.

Sfeeha?

Yeah, it's kind of like a shepherd's pie.

Huh?

[Frank]

She is such a good cook.

She's been slaving away all day.

Oh, slaving?

And you are such a good boyfriend.

[chuckles] Charlotte, it's so good to meet you.

I have to say that no one in Frank's family has ever even heard of you.

[Charlotte]

I know.

It's crazy, right?

Uh-huh.

Especially since we've been together almost five years.

Shut your mouth!

Yes, Charlotte, shut your mouth.

I bet it's because of the Jewish thing.

What Jewish thing?

[Charlotte] Oh, well,

Frank probably thought that you would all disapprove of him living in sin with a dirty Jew.

[Kitty gasps]

Sweetheart.

Uh-huh? You remember what we decided tonight.

No, uh, politics...

No religion.

That's right.

Of course, yes.

I'm so sorry.

I'm just a bitch. [Laughs]

[Frank] Mm.

That's what Mike calls me.

[Charlotte]

Oh...

I think we're gonna get along just fine.

Hell, I'm just glad you ain't black.

[laughing]

[Mike chuckles]

Okay, let's not forget why we're all here.

To Miss Elizabeth Bledsoe,

New York University freshman, class of 1976.

[glasses clink]

[Kitty] America's birthday.

It's all just beginning for you, Beth.

[Charlotte] Mazel tov.

Mazel top.

[Beth chuckles]

[glasses clink]

Congrats.

Congrats.

Enjoy.

[students chattering]

Do you mind if I sit here?

No, of course not.

I'm Bruce.

Hi. I'm Beth.

Where are you from, Beth?

South Carolina.

Charleston?

No, a tiny little town you've never heard of, I'm sure.

Well, try me.

Creekville.

Never heard of it.

I'm from Bismarck, North Dakota, but I tell people

I'm from Greenwich.

I've decided I'm gonna be who I want to be instead of letting other people dictate who I am.

Other people or facts, apparently.

[both chuckle]

[Bruce] Favorite author.

I can't pick just one.

Okay. Favorite authors.

Carson McCullers.

Eudora Welty.

Harper Lee.

Jane Austen, of course.

Uh, Charlotte Bronte.

No men. Hmm.

Mark Twain.

You?

Well, Shakespeare. Dickens.

Mark Twain.

Ken Kesey. William Styron.

Truman Capote.

No women.

Grace Metalious.

Jacqueline Susann.

[laughs] Sure.

[chuckles]

[laughs] Actually,

I want to take this, um... this class on 19th-century women writers.

Uh, I think the professor's name is Bledsoe.

I hear he's amazing.

Frank Bledsoe?

Uh, he's my uncle.

Seriously?

Yeah.

Would you mind introducing me to him? I mean, at some point.

Something tells me that you and I are gonna be spending a lot of time together.

[chuckles softly]

I hope so.

[siren wailing in distance]

[music playing in other room]

You okay?

Yeah, uh, I-I just...

Uh, I've never...

Oh.

But I want to.

I just...

No.

No, no, we should wait.

No, it's okay. I just...

No, no.

I don't want to screw things up by moving too fast.

I like you too much.

[chuckles softly]

We can keep making out, though.

Okay.

Come in.

I will be right with you.

And... yes.

[chuckles]

Oh, Beth!

Hi. I've been meaning to call you.

I've been snowed under.

How are you?

How are you adjusting to college?

To New York?

I love it.

But, um, this is my boyfriend Bruce. [Chuckles]

Your...

[Beth chuckles]

Okay. It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

I've heard raves about your class.

Good to meet you.

Um... unfortunately, you caught me at a bad time.

I have to type an exam and get copies made before 3:00, so...

[Beth]

Oh, okay.

But I will call you, I promise.

Sure.

[chuckles]

Bye.

I should've called him first.

Hey, Frank, what time does your party start tonight?

[Frank] Around 8:00.

Should I bring a guest?

No.

[Frank] You'd better.

[laughs] Okay.

I'll see you there.

No.

[doorbell rings]

[funk music playing over speakers in distance]

Hello.

Who are you?

Oh, uh, hi.

Hi.

Uh, I'm Beth Bledsoe,

Frank's niece.

Frank's niece?

Oh, my God, Beth.

Hey! Nice meeting you.

[Beth chuckles]

Oh, my God.

My name is Wally.

How are you?

I've been begging Frank to introduce us.

Hi. I'm Bruce.

Oh, my goodness.

[sighs]

I'm just not sure why he didn't tell me you were coming.

Oh, that's because he doesn't know.

He doesn't know?

Oh, I thought he wanted to surprise me.

[both laughing]

Well, okay, it's gonna be very exciting.

I'm excited. Come on in.

Come in, come in, please!

Shut the door behind you.

Hey. Don't smoke in here.

It's illegal.

I don't want to go to jail.

Why not? It's a party.

[Wally] Shut up.

[Beth] So, uh, how do you know Uncle Frank?

Uh, he's my roommate.

[chuckling] Why?

Oh, uh, I thought he lived with Charlotte.

Yes, he does.

We all... We live together because it's a big apartment and, uh... and, uh, rent is very expensive.

Uh, tell you what,

I'm gonna go track him down, and you're gonna stay here.

Uh, do not move.

[Beth chuckles]

No, I'm serious, Beth.

Do not move.

[laughing]

Okay. Okay.

Look at this smile.

I'm gonna go find the alcohol.

Oh, what do you want?

Uh, surprise me.

[music continues]

Hey, Frank.

Seriously?

This is what you do?

[chuckling]

Have sex in other people's homes?

[scoffs]

We're not having sex.

Hm. Okay.

[Wally sighs]

By the way,

Frank's niece is here, and you may need to be a slut of a girlfriend... again.

I cannot believe you are still pissed at me for getting to meet

Frank's brother's family.

Don't you ever take credit for my cooking, Charlotte.

I mean it.

Okay, go on.

[laughter]

Oh, I'm sorry.

I was just, um...

You want a drink?

Uh, sure.

I'll have a martini.

Gin or vodka?

Uh, vodka.

Olive?

Sure. Why not?

[chuckles]

I love your hair.

Oh, thanks.

I love yours.

Enjoy.

Thank you.

[Frank] Oh, fuck Agnew.

It's Nixon who needs to go.

[music continues inside]

He's such a snake.

He'll figure out a way to stay in power.

I don't know, Bernard.

I have more faith in the system than you do.

It's not hard to do, as I have none.

You are...?

Bruce.

Bruce.

[Bruce] Hi.

[Bernard] Hi.

Bernard.

What are you, uh...

I came here with Beth.

Beth is here?

Don't worry, Frank.

We're a lot hipper than you think.

I believe I'll go get another drink.

[door closes]

Beth's a sweet girl.

Yeah, she's a very sweet girl.

[Bruce] I'm not sure where she gets the idea

I'm her boyfriend.

We haven't had sex.

It's not like we ever will.

[chuckles]

She's not really my type.

Do you honestly believe that I'll risk my job, my relationship, my entire life just to have sex with you?

Who has to know?

You think I've never had sex with a beautiful young man, Bruce?

Hell, I used to be a beautiful young man.

You still are.

[chuckles]

Come on, let it go.

My blow jobs are like poetry.

[chuckles]

How?

In what way is a blow job like poetry, Bruce?

Does it rhyme?

Is it metered?

Does it employ aesthetic qualities in addition to or instead of its notional and semantic content?

Wow, you flunk.

Unaccustomed to not getting what you want, aren't you, Bruce?

Seriously?

Seriously, get out of here.

Come on, get out of here.

[stammers]

Come on.

[laughter, lively chatter]

[music playing]

[chattering continues]

Where have you been?

Whoa.

You've had enough.

Oh, no, it's a martini.

Uh, listen, Beth, I need to go.

Your uncle completely flipped out on me.

I think he's stoned.

On pot?

God only knows what he's going to tell you.

Call me.

[grunts]

[bottle shatters]

[chatter stops]

[music continues]

It's okay, Beth. Come on.

What did you say to Bruce?

Let's go get a cup of coffee.

Oh, nope. Not on the rug. Come on. [Retches]

[vomiting]

There you go. Yeah.

You're gonna feel so much better after this.

Believe me.

[coughing]

[door opens]

[Wally] Hey, Frank.

I've been looking for you everywhere to warn you that she was here. [Beth coughs]

[clicks tongue]

Oh, Beth.

She's okay.

What happened?

You little poor thing.

So, where were you?

I was on the fire stairs.

With?

Bernard.

Bernard the pothead?

Can we not, in front of her?

Oh, don't worry about that.

She's not gonna remember any of it.

Here.

Did you smoke pot?

Yes. It's a party.

Yeah, and you're sober.

And marijuana is not alcohol.

No, but it's illegal.

And you smoke it outside where anybody can smell it.

[Beth coughing]

[clicks tongue]

Did he make a play for you?

He's way too repressed to ever do anything like that.

[whispers]

Her boyfriend did, though.

That shrimp?

Oh, I did not like him the minute I saw him.

[toilet flushing]

Bruce said you freaked out.

Why'd you freak out?

Uh...

Beth, do you know what, um...

Wow.

Okay, do you know what being gay means?

Well...

I'm gay.

And so is Wally.

Um, we live together.

We have for ten years.

And the reason

I freaked out is because...

Bruce tried, rather ineptly to seduce me, and he seemed unwilling to take no for an answer.

So I hope you weren't too invested in him, because he seems a little, um...

Gay.

Not worth it.

No, come on. Luckily, you don't need to think about any of that right now.

All you need to do is go to the guest room and pass out.

I'll clean this up later.

[door opens]

Oh, don't worry.

I'll do it.

You came out to Beth tonight.

I know.

I did not expect that to happen.

It gave me a boner.

Also unexpected.

[laughing]

[machinery clanking and whirring outside]

[music playing softly]

[praying in Arabic]

[Frank]

There's coffee on the table, two aspirin and a big glass of water.

[laughing] You should...

You should drink it.

Oh, please tell me you eat bacon.

Good, 'cause Wally, he hates even the smell of it.

But I'm a good Southern boy, and bacon's in my blood.

[food sizzling]

So, you feel any different about me?

Oh, I don't think so.

Never known anybody who was gay before.

Of course you have.

You just weren't aware of it.

Choir director at First Baptist Church.

Mr. Dickerson?

But he's so...

What?

Religious.

Beth...

I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone in the family about me.

Oh, sure, of course.

Eh, we're from such different worlds now.

It wouldn't do any...

[Wally] Change anything?

You don't see them anyways, Frank.

Hey, Beth.

How you feeling?

When's the last time you saw your family?

Uh, I think August of last year.

Good morning, Barbara Stanwyck.

[vocalizes]

I go there at least every two years. You know that.

He shows them photographs of a phony wife, who's also played by Charlotte, by the way.

You want eggs?

[chuckling] Yes, please.

If I told them I was with a man, it would bring shame on them.

Why do you think it wouldn't bring shame on my family?

Americans don't care about honor, Frank.

Ha!

I wish I thought my family could get past it, but I don't.

I think your family would eventually accept it.

[Frank] Here you go. Yeah, well, you don't know my family.

Thank you. No, but you came from them, so how bad can they be?

[song ends]

[Frank] How about this?

How about... you tell your family, and then I'll tell mine.

Are you kidding? In Saudi

Arabia, they would behead me.

[swing music playing]

Ugh.

Your bacon smells like death.

Delicious death.

[Wally] And this music.

[music stops]

[Wally] Ugh.

[percussive Arabic music playing]

Oh, come on, now, Wally.

Please?

[groaning]

Oh, no. Oh, no.

[chuckles]

What are you doing?

[phone ringing]

[laughing]

Oh, that's your phone.

Beth.

Have you met Barbara Stanwyck?

[Frank] Yeah, hello?

Hey, Mama. Isn't she cute?

She's the cutest thing ever.

[Mammaw] Frank, your daddy's gone.

He's gone.

What? [Mammaw]

He died this morning.

Oh, Frank.

How?

Heart attack.

Just out of nowhere, getting into the car. Okay.

He seemed perfectly okay, then he grabbed his arm. Mama...

[Mammaw crying] Oh,

Frank, what am I gonna do?

Oh, wait, your sister's here.

Do you mind holding on?

No, I'm okay.

Hold on.

[Mammaw sobbing]

[Frank] And what time's that land in Greenville?

Yes, okay, Mama.

I promise.

[Frank] Is that the last flight of the day?

[Beth] Love you, too. Bye.

[Frank] Eastern, 235.

[Frank] Okay.

She doesn't want me to fly.

Uh, she's scared of it.

She gets hysterical.

[Frank]

She's not the one flying.

She made me promise

I would take the train.

You can take the car.

Can you hold on for a second?

It's faster than the train, and it'll give you guys a chance to get to know each other.

I would love that.

Yeah.

What? Are you seriously thinking of not going?

Frank, that'll break your mother's heart. You need to go.

You need to stay out of this, please.

You're not gonna run away from this your whole life, you know?

Please, Uncle Frank?

[sighs] Fuck.

Um, okay, sorry.

Uh, change of plans.

We can take turns driving.

No, Wally, you're not coming.

[lighter clicking]

You're pushing me away again.

Just when you're gonna need me the most.

I didn't come to your father's funeral.

No, I did not want you to come to my father's funeral.

[Frank] Yes, and I respected your wishes, and I didn't try to talk you into letting me.

[Wally] It's not the same thing.

I have a question. Are you the stupidest man alive?

Obviously.

Look who I'm with.

[sighs]

Look.

You need me for this.

You know you do.

Wally, I appreciate you wanting to be there for me, I do, but honestly, it will be so much harder for me if you come.

Okay.

Thank you.

I'm gonna do the dishes.

[♪♪♪]

[radio playing softly]

It's so weird.

I'll never see Daddy Mac again.

You've never known anyone who died?

There was this one boy in high school who got killed in a car wreck.

But I didn't know him well.

Some of the other kids who never even talked to him when he was alive started acting like he was their best friend.

So they could cry and people would feel sorry for 'em.

People are idiots.

[laughs]

[The Capitols' "Cool Jerk" playing on radio]

I know. Aren't they?

Yep.

♪ Cool jerk ♪

[Beth] What does Wally do?

[Frank] Oh, he's an aeronautics engineer.

Where'd you meet him?

[laughing]

On the subway.

I was reading Seven Pillars of Wisdom by T.E. Lawrence, and he asked me why

I was reading it.

And I told him I'd just seen the film Lawrence of Arabia.

And he said,

"Well, I'm from Arabia."

And...

I don't know, we got to talking.

[chuckles] Okay.

Saved my life.

What about you?

Any boyfriends?

Besides the idiot Bruce.

No, I'm still a virgin.

Not because I want to be.

Just none of the boys I've known seemed worth the trouble.

I almost did it with Bruce, but he said...

He said what?

It's too soon?

Doesn't want to mess up your friendship?

Something like that?

You think that's because he's gay?

Oh, I think 99% of straight boys would have gone ahead with it.

[chuckles]

I just thought it was my fault.

[chuckling]

Guys like Bruce always make you think it's your fault.

What a jerk.

[chuckles]

[Frank]

That's letting him off too easy.

He's an asshole.

[Beth laughs]

You can call him an asshole, can't you?

[Beth] What an asshole.

[Frank] There you go.

[Beth] What a fucking asshole.

[Frank laughs]

There you go.

"See the world's largest teapot."

[Beth] Yeah, or George

Washington's outdoor bathtub.

Mm. What is the Mystery Hole?

The what?

"See the unbelievable

Mystery Hole."

Uh, I don't think we need to go there.

[Beth laughs]

[music playing over speakers]

Did you always know you were gay?

I... I always knew

I was different.

From day one.

But I... I definitely knew by the time I hit puberty.

You have to realize, it wasn't talked about then the way it is now.

I didn't think there was anyone else like me.

Well, heck, I feel that way.

[chuckles softly]

What about you?

You ever get a crush on a girl?

[laughs]

[chuckling] What?

Uh, not really.

One time, uh,

I practiced making out with

Becky Eller at a sleepover.

Oh... But I pretended she was a boy.

And how... How was it?

[laughs]

Embarrassing.

When was the first time you, um...

I was 16.

Who was it with?

Just a boy from school.

Ma'am, could we get the check?

[song fading]

[♪♪♪]

[Young Frank]

Come on, Sam!

[both laughing]

Sam!

[laughing]

[Frank shouts]

[water burbling]

[♪♪♪]

[Beth] There's a graveyard statue in Parkersburg that weeps.

What?

Apparently, she grants wishes.

[car slowing]

What's wrong?

[engine shuts off]

Stay here.

[insects trilling, birds chirping]

Hello?

Wally?

Oh, hey.

What the fuck are you doing here, Wally?

You scared me half to death.

You forgot your razor, uh, and your favorite tie.

You rented a car just to bring me a razor and a tie?

Isn't it snazzy?

Look, it's a convertible.

You agreed to stay home.

Just admit you're glad I'm here.

Jesus.

Come on.

And stop acting like your father dying is not a big deal.

Of course it's a big fucking deal, Wally.

It could end up being a positive thing.

You need to be part of your family.

I don't want to be a part of my family.

Bullshit, and you know it.

[Beth] Wally?

Get back in the car!

Hey, don't talk to her like this. She's not your kid.

Beth, stay.

Stay.

Look, I just want to help, however you might need it.

And you know you're going to.

You were there for me when I did.

You can't meet them, Wally.

You can't.

Okay, I won't.

And you can't come to the funeral.

But you can come to me whenever you need to.

[sighs]

[crickets chirping]

[female clerk] So, that's two rooms at $14 each.

Uh, I don't think we need two rooms.

We can make do with just one if you have a cot.

What is the relationship?

Uh...

Hmm?

The relationship between the two of you... uh, and the young lady over there.

Oh, she's my niece.

I'm his nephew.

I'm afraid I'm gonna need the young lady to stay in her own room.

Yeah, that makes sense.

Okay. Yeah.

I used to fantasize about different ways for my father to die.

Which, of course,

I felt tremendous guilt about.

You WASPs, you love your guilt.

That's actually not true.

I fucking hate it.

You know, you have nothing to feel guilty about.

Mm, I know it intellectually.

Just make sure you don't bury it all inside yourself and explode later.

Probably at me.

You look like you belong in a 1950s Bible movie.

Oh, yeah? I do?

[man on TV]

Blessed be thou, Samuel.

Here he is, David.

[thunder crashing on TV]

[rhythmic thumping in other room]

[Frank, Wally grunting, moaning]

[bed creaking]

Hey, Beth?

You want to ride with me?

[exhales sharply]

Uh, is that okay with you?

Of course it's okay.

Why wouldn't it be okay?

Okay.

He's cranky today.

[both laughing]

Bye.

[♪♪♪]

So, Beth...

Answer one question for me.

Why is your uncle so odd?

[chuckles]

What's odd about him?

"What's odd about him?"

He's the oddest man

I've ever seen in my whole life.

He seems pretty normal to me.

Really? Huh.

He's so stoic, Beth.

Like a mule.

There's a layer between him and the rest of the world.

You know what I mean?

Uh, not really.

I don't really know him that well.

But I've always liked him.

Oh, dear.

You're just like him.

[laughing]

Must be hereditary.

[both laughing]

[Southern accent]

You guys are so nice all the time.

[laughs]

I mean, don't you get exhausted being nice all the time?

[water burbling]

[muffled chatter]

[laughter]

[inhales deeply]

[laughing]

I know that

Frank's father's the devil and his mom's a saint.

[folk music playing over radio]

His sister knows about me, apparently.

She does?

Mm-hm.

Oh, that's my Aunt Neva.

She's real nice.

[laughing] Beth, I'm not interested in nice.

Nice always hides something.

What's hidden is what interests me.

What about his brother?

What's he like?

Well, his brother's my daddy, and he's not that nice sometimes.

But how is he not nice?

He says mean things.

Like what?

Like, um... like I'm a little smart-ass, and ain't no man likes a girl with a smart mouth.

Yep, he's right about that.

Most men don't.

I think I'm gonna like your dad.

[chuckles]

I really do.

What about your family?

Are they...

Oh, they're very nice.

All right. [Laughs]

[laughing]

They're crazy.

My mom is a woman with a smart mouth.

And indeed, my dad did not like it.

But she's got so much love.

She's my heart.

[sighs]

[engine rattling, squeaking]

What the...?

Oh, come on!

What'd you do to the car?

[Frank] Well, how long's that gonna take?

I'm gonna have to wait to get you a new torque converter in from Greensboro.

Earliest I can have it in for you is Monday.

[Frank]

See, that's not an option.

Well, ain't no other'n

I can think of.

[softly] Fuck.

Just leave it here.

You can pick it up on our way back to New York.

J.B. don't usually like doing that, but...

I'm gonna say yes.

'Cause if y'all come back, that means I get to see this pretty little lady again.

[mechanic chuckles]

[chuckles]

I'm just playing with you.

Y'all don't mind, do you?

You don't need these men's permission to play with me.

You need mine.

[chuckles]

Which I will never, ever give you, because you are presumptuous and disrespectful.

And you're probably even stupider than you look.

[chuckles]

And you look pretty goddamn stupid.

[laughing]

[laughing]

[laughs] You made me feel sorry for that boy.

Gross.

Look at it from his perspective, Beth.

You're a pretty girl.

You're wearing nice makeup.

You're wearing nice clothes.

So it's my fault he's a creep?

You'll have to forgive Wally, Beth.

In the country that he comes from, they like to wrap women up in sheets and lock 'em away because they're just too dangerous.

That's why I left.

Oh.

That and the execution of homosexuals.

Seriously?

Yes.

Beheading, hanging.

And sometimes they're only teenagers.

I knew I couldn't find love if I stayed there.

If I did, I could die for it, but, uh, I did not want my life to be this way.

[insects trilling, birds chirping]

Hey.

You know he can't hurt you anymore.

It's not him.

It's Sam.

Come, let's have some ice cream.

I'm good.

My dad used to take us for ice cream every Saturday, even if we misbehaved.

[gentle ballad playing over radio]

What's your favorite flavor?

Rosewater with cream chips.

It's delicious.

Sounds like soap.

No, it doesn't. No.

[laughing] It does.

[Wally] Arabic ice cream is very different.

It's thicker and chewier, you know, because of the mastic that they put...

[♪♪♪]

[Beth]

Oh, we're here.

[Wally]

"Welcome to Creekville."

[sighs]

[Wally] Hm.

Where's the creek?

You any kin to old Mac

Bledsoe who just died?

I'm his son.

Mike?

[chuckles] You don't even look like yourself anymore.

I'm Frank, the oldest.

Oh.

You're the one who runned off to New York.

That's the one.

[keys rattling]

There's your keys.

Look at me.

[key rattles]

Thank you.

[chuckles]

You need to wait ten minutes before checking in.

Yeah, I know the drill.

No, Wally.

Ten minutes... I mean it.

It's different down here.

Okay, sweetheart. Okay.

That old fart will call the police. They will put us in jail.

I got to get ready to go to the funeral parlor.

[Beth] I thought we were going to the funeral home.

[Frank sighs]

I'll be two seconds.

Right.

I was so worried you two got in a...

Oh. Oh.

Hey, Kitty.

I thought you got in a wreck and were laying dead in a ditch somewhere.

[sighs]

Thank you for driving her.

I couldn't have her on a plane. I just couldn't.

I know.

My stepdad's cousin's son died in a plane crash.

You might remember that.

I get it.

It happens to real people.

I... I'm...

Yeah, okay.

I'm sorry about your daddy.

[Frank] Mama.

[sobs softly]

Frank!

Oh, Mama.

[crying]

Oh, it's so good you're here.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

No warning.

You know, he just dropped dead right in front of me, getting into the car.

We was about to go to the Food Lion.

Oh, Mama, it's all right.

[sobbing]

It's okay. It's okay.

Oh, Frank, Frank, Frank.

He loved you.

Mm-hm.

No, he did, he did, he did. Mm.

He did. He loved you.

You want...

You want to see him?

Yeah. He looks real good. Real good.

Hey, big brother.

Oh, hey, Mike.

He's the best friend

I'll ever have.

Really?

Mm-hm. Yeah.

I only asked him to be best man in my wedding

'cause I was scared not to.

[chuckles]

After the rehearsal dinner, we got shit-faced.

[chuckles]

Goddamn, he was like another man.

He was, like, funny.

Told me how, uh, he felt like he was never good enough for Mama.

He told me how he thought

Kitty wasn't good enough for me, which he was wrong about.

We were both hung over at the wedding.

You didn't notice?

Uh-uh.

I just thought you seemed nervous.

[both chuckling]

I was shaking like an old hound dog trying to shit out a peach pit.

Oh.

[chuckles softly]

You know,

I've been driving up here once a week for more than 20 years... just to have breakfast with Daddy.

He'd ask if

I had heard from you.

Course, I hadn't.

But I never kept in touch much with you, neither.

Well, it's...

Hey.

And for that...

[stammers]

[sobbing] I...

[whispers]

I'm sorry.

[stammering]

You don't need to be sorry.

It's okay.

[Mike sighs]

[Frank sighs]

[Wally] Hello?

Hello?

Hello.

Mom?

[both speaking in Arabic]

[bird twittering over phone]

[bottle clunks in trash]

[Kitty] It just doesn't make any sense.

Betty wants to stay in a motel all by herself instead of sleeping at home in her own bed.

It's Beth, and I'm not by myself.

Uncle Frank is staying there, too. So is Wally.

Who's Wally?

He's a man that we met.

Me and Uncle Frank.

He's staying at the motel, too.

Well, that doesn't sound right.

No, ma'am, that sounds wronger than wrong.

How old are you, Betty?

It's...

I'm 18, and it's Beth.

18, and you want to stay by yourself in a motel?

Aren't you... Aren't you concerned about your reputation?

My reputation with whom?

Men care about things like that.

Trust me,

I know from experience.

[Frank] It's almost 9:00.

We should be headed back.

Frank, I don't understand why Betty has... [scoffs]

Beth has to stay in a motel when she can sleep at home in her own bed.

It's a waste of money.

Well, I'm not sure that's your decision to make, Kitty, because Beth is an adult now and she gets to make up her own mind.

It's only my second time in a motel, Mama.

It's fun.

Well, I hope it's clean, at least.

Frank, who is Wally?

I told them about the man we met at the motel, with the Winnebago.

Oh, the guy with the dog?

Yeah.

They're traveling across America.

[Beth] He's so cute, Mama.

Smartest dog I ever met.

You got to be careful about strange dogs, you know.

They can bite you.

He's blind.

[chuckling]

The dog, not the driver.

[woman speaking in Arabic]

[Beth] Good night.

[woman speaking in Arabic]

[kissing loudly]

Frank. Frank.

[Frank sighs]

[sighs]

I can smell the alcohol.

[sniffs]

Look, if ever I had a reason to drink, this would be it.

Bullshit.

Can you just stop?

I can't take it from you,

Wally. Not right now.

At least wait till this whole thing is over.

Can you do that for me?

Would that be okay with you?

Could you do it for me?

I won't go through it again. I won't.

I'll be up if you need to talk.

Good night.

Mac Bledsoe was the kind of man you don't see much anymore.

Dedicated husband.

Loving father.

Good American.

Good Christian.

A man for whom doing the right thing, it wasn't a choice.

It was his duty.

It was his duty to teach his children the difference between right and wrong.

[sportscast playing indistinctly]

And now it's our duty.

It's our duty to walk... in the same path of righteousness as Mac.

[Daddy Mac] I don't want you seeing that Lassiter boy again.

If I find out you are,

I'll kill you both.

You're gambling with your very soul, son.

Opening yourself up to that sickness.

You want to be a queer, hm?

A faggot?

It's perversion.

God hisself will turn his back on you.

Cast you into the lake of fire.

[sighs]

[preacher] It's what

God expected of Mac, and it's what God now expects of us.

Let us pray.

Our Father...

[others join in] who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.

[insects trilling]

Thy kingdom come.

Thy will be done...

[panting]

...on Earth as it is in Heaven.

[sighs]

Oh, my God.

Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.

Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever.

[water burbling]

Amen.

[engine rumbling outside]

[clock ticking]

[insects trilling]

[sighs, grunts]

[♪♪♪]

[Marsha] Mm. Everyone up there talk like a Yankee?

Not everybody.

Mm, mm!

You see any famous people in New York?

Yes. Truman Capote.

Truman who?

Oh, I think I saw Rhoda's mom from The Mary Tyler Moore Show.

Oh!

[chuckles]

So, what about you?

How's life?

Mm.

Honestly, Beth,

I've never been happier.

That's great, Marsha.

Yeah.

I love being a mother.

I love being pregnant.

I love Travis more every day.

He's a really good daddy.

Uh, Travis?

Mm. Mm-hm.

He don't go by Tee Dub no more now that he's a business owner.

Yeah. [Chuckles]

But, oh, we still get it on all the time.

He is very blessed in that department.

[chuckles]

[softly]

That's nice.

What's wrong, monkey?

You want to wear Mama's shoes?

[mumbles]

[laughs]

He loves to do that.

I have no idea why.

[chuckles]

[Neva] So, how's Wally?

He's good.

I think he should be here with you.

He is here.

He's at the motel.

Well, go get him.

Get him?

I want to meet him.

After all these years.

At Dad's funeral?

"Excuse me, everyone.

I have an announcement to make."

Frank, it is 1973.

And I know Beau would be okay with it, and Kitty, probably.

Mike, that's a question mark.

No shit.

You want one?

No, thank you.

You sure?

I'm sure.

Mm.

It's just for this.

I swear.

You want to pinkie-promise me?

Pinkie promise.

What kind of wake doesn't have a bar?

One in this town.

I'm just waiting for Aunt Butch to ask me,

"Is there any news on the female front?"

She has a spider in her hair.

She what?

[laughing] Yeah.

I shared a car with her to the cemetery, and I...

I thought I saw something moving in there.

[laughing] I looked closer, and it was a spider.

Did you tell her?

You didn't?

[laughing]

Oh, I don't want to hurt her feelings.

I mean, remember how mad she got when I told her her wig was on backwards and she'd just been in church all day? [Laughing]

That's why she stopped wearing wigs.

Well...

[chuckles]

My baby. My baby boy.

Mm-hm.

[chattering]

[door closes]

Well, hey there, Frank.

I've been looking for you.

Aunt Butch, don't you look pretty today.

Tell me, any news on the female front?

Nope.

Well, how old are you?

You must be getting on up there.

I'm... I'm 46.

Well, you got to get moving, boy.

You're gonna end up like me. Oh.

Course, it's different for men.

[chuckles, clicks tongue]

[sighs softly]

[Mike] Hey.

Y'all need to come in the house.

Is anything wrong?

No. The lawyer's here.

I realize this is unorthodox timing and a rather unusual venue for the reading of the will, but Mac wanted to make sure that it happened while all his kids were still here.

[lawyer clears throat]

All right, then.

[clears throat]

"I, Francis MacKenzie Bledsoe, being of sound mind and body, do hereby declare this to be my last will and testament.

First, to my wife

Evelyn Caldwell Bledsoe,

I leave the whole of my estate and assets, with the exception of the following designated amounts.

To my son,

Michael James Bledsoe, and to my daughter,

Neva Mae Bledsoe Henderson,

"I leave the sum of $25,000 each."

To my sister,

Florence Vivian Bledsoe,

I leave the sum of $500.

To my oldest son,

Francis MacKenzie Bledsoe, Jr...

I leave nothing but disgust with the filthy and unnatural perversion he engages in with other men,

"and shame that he carries my name." [gasps softly]

[Frank groans softly]

What?

[stammers softly]

[Mammaw exhales sharply]

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

[clicks tongue]

[crying] Frank.

I'm so sorry, Frank.

I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Frank, please don't go.

Please don't go.

Frank!

[sighs]

He's never gonna come back.

Jesus.

[engine starts]

[Janis] How's life?

Life sucks, Beth.

I'm 22, I work at the bakery at the goddamn Food Lion, and I still live at home with Mama and Daddy.

Oh, my Lord, y'all are not gonna believe what just happened.

Daddy, I need to borrow your car.

Daddy, it's an emergency!

Wait, what kind of emergency?

Just give me the goddamn keys!

[insects trilling]

[gate clangs]

Frank.

[lock clicking]

Is Uncle Frank here?

Isn't he at the wake?

No, he left.

Everybody knows he's gay now.

Daddy Mac put it in his will.

But Uncle Frank got in the car and drove away.

Was he drunk?

Was he drunk?

I think so.

Oh, my God.

Why would he drive drunk?

[water burbling]

Stay right there.

We can't ever do that stuff again.

Frank.

We have to stop now... if we want any chance to be normal and not end up perverts.

Do you want to be a faggot?

A queer?

Do you want to go to hell?

'Cause it's a sickness!

And God hates it.

Don't ever come near me... or talk to me again.

[insects trilling]

[panting]

[bird squawking]

[Beth] Why do you think he's at the lake?

[Wally] 'Cause I know what happened there, Beth.

I know how Frank is when he gets drunk.

There should be a gate up here on the left.

[sighs] Fuck.

[Beth] This way.

[Beth]

Maybe he went for a swim?

He'd never take these off.

[Wally]

Frank!

Fuck! Fuck!

Why are you in my room?

Frank?

You fucking idiot of a moron! What? What?

Do you know what you just put me through?

I just went for a swim.

I couldn't find my car.

Jesus. Wake up... the fuck up, Frank!

You're not the only one something bad happened to. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

[Wally] There are people who love you.

[Frank] Yeah, well, people are idiots.

Fuck.

Oh, you motherfucker.

Fine.

Go ahead, destroy yourself.

Destroy us.

Us?

What the fuck is us?

I hate us.

We're freaks. Cheers.

[Frank, Wally grunting]

Uncle Frank, don't!

[yells]

He's just trying to help you.

[Wally] Stop it!

[Frank] Fuck you!

Stop it!

Get off me!

[grunts] Fucker!

Stop it!

Fuck you!

Frank! [Groans]

You motherfucker!

You faggot!

You pussy!

Faggot! [Panting]

Frank, it's okay.

[Frank grunts]

[Beth] Stop!

[Wally groans]

[door opens]

[door closes]

Wally, aren't you going to follow him?

[birds chirping, insects trilling]

Couldn't even say it to my face, could you?

Coward.

[sobbing]

[mutters]

[sniffles]

What did I do?

[sobbing]

[sobbing, muttering]

Oh, God! Oh, God.

[muttering]

[exhales]

Sam.

Forgive me.

Forgive me.

[Frank panting]

Oh, Samuel.

Sam.

Frank.

[Frank sniffles]

[Frank]

I have no family.

You have me.

I'm your family, and you're mine.

Till death.

You know it, I know it, and God knows it.

And that's all that matters.

[inhales]

I'm sorry.

You should be.

Mama made me promise if I found you, I'd bring you back.

I don't want to see them, Beth.

But, so years ago, when you told me

I should be what I want to be, not what other people want me to be, that was just bullshit?

You know, that conversation changed my life.

Now I find out you can't be who you are unless nobody around you disagrees with it.

I thought you, uh... you might want this back.

You want to go meet my fucking family?

Yeah.

If you take a shower first. [Laughs]

Ugh, Frank, it's like the sewers of Sri Lanka.

[laughing] Geez.

[laughs]

At least she didn't crash the car.

Who the fuck is this guy?

Hey, Mike.

Frank.

I got two words for you.

No problem.

You're my big brother.

Whatever you are, no problem.

Hey, Mike, uh... this is Walid.

Hey, man. Call me Wally.

Okay.

[patting back]

No problem.

[exhales]

Thank you, Kitty.

I have to tell you something.

This makes me like you even more.

Yeah?

Yeah.

[whispers]

My hairdresser is gay.

Oh. He is the most hilarious person in the whole world.

I really want to introduce you to him.

We have so much in common, probably. Yes!

Wally, this is my sister-in-law, Kitty.

[chuckles] I love your name. Yeah.

[both laughing]

Aw. Mm.

[chuckles] Oh.

Okay.

[laughing]

Aw.

Oh, God, you smell so good!

Do you all smell good?

[both] Yes.

[laughing]

Come with me. Come on.

I am so proud of you.

And this must be Wally.

Neva.

Oh!

You're exactly how

I imagined you.

Oh, I've been wanting to meet you for so long.

Me, too.

Welcome.

This is Beau. Hey, Beau.

Frank.

And, uh, Wally.

Right?

Beau.

[chuckles awkwardly]

Um...

If y'all could, uh, excuse me for a minute.

Um...

It's okay.

[chuckling]

It's okay.

You know, when I was a little girl in Jacksonboro, there was a man in town.

He was a dance teacher.

He was some kind of a dago or Mexican.

Oh.

He had a name like Carlos or Antonio, but everybody called him "the tissy pretzel."

And he was a backwards bobby like you.

You're not the only one.

[chuckles]

I hear Charleston is just crawling with them these days.

You're all going to hell, you know?

Aunt Butch.

I know... that that is the very best that you're capable of.

[Mammaw]

Frank!

[footsteps approaching]

Frank.

You are my precious gift from God... and nothing... nothing will ever change that.

[trembling]

[both crying softly]

It's okay.

Oh, baby.

Your daddy was scared of it.

Always was.

You remember how much he hated your Great-Uncle Jasper?

Uncle Jasper was...?

Uh-huh. He was.

I figured that's probably why you were.

I mean, if being curly-headed is something that gets passed down, why not...

You knew?

Mothers know.

Oh, well...

Who's this?

Come here. Come here.

Come here. Come here.

Mama, this is... this is Wally.

I've wanted to meet you for so long, Mrs. Bledsoe.

And... and I'm so sorry for your loss.

Thank you.

Well, he has as much hair on his face as he does on his head, doesn't he?

[laughing]

[laughs]

I've got you something.

Mm.

A little gift from New York City.

[Mammaw] Oh...

[scoffs]

How pretty.

Well, it's nice to meet you, Wally.

Nice meeting you, too, ma'am.

And please call me Mammaw.

Mammaw.

You... You should go on and sit down now.

Honey, go. Run.

Get out.

[Mammaw]

You can sit down now.

[Neva] He is my brother.

That doesn't make it right.

It isn't wrong.

Well...

The Bible says it's a sin.

[Neva] The Bible also says that it's okay to have slaves.

And okay to, like, marry ten...

[Beau] Oh, so what, you don't believe in the Bible no more?

How you doing?

Good.

How about you?

I'm good.

[conversation continues]

[Beth] What I remember most about my Granddaddy Mac's funeral is just sitting around the backyard after everybody else had left.

[laughter]

And it was just us.

[chattering, laughter]

The sun was starting to go down.

There was a breeze.

And I remember thinking... this is where I belong.

Not like I belonged with my family.

It was bigger than that.

Like every single one of us belonged there, in that backyard, on that afternoon.

And I realized in that moment... we were all exactly where we were supposed to be.

This story ends before you were born.

Mother.

Again.

When we woke up feeling hands that were no longer there, the elders told us that it was the work of ghosts or Satan.

Or that we were lying to get attention.

Or that it was an act of wild female imagination.

It went on for years.

To all of us.

It felt like weightlessness.

It felt like drifting over what used to be real.

- It felt like a banishment, as though we had no invitation anymore to be a part of the real.

I used to wonder who I would be if it hadn't happened to me.

I used to miss the person

I might have been.

I don't anymore.

Because it's doomsday and a call to prayer.

It's both.

We caught one of them.

I saw his face.

And then he named the others.

Come on.

Eventually the attackers were taken to the police in the city for their own protection.

Almost all of the men of the colony went to the city to post bail for the attackers.

We were given two days to forgive the attackers before they returned.

If we did not forgive them we would be ordered to leave the colony and be denied entry into the Kingdom of Heaven.

Do nothing.

Stay and fight.

Leave.

Girls in our colony had very little schooling.

We hardly knew how to read or to write.

But that day, we learned how to vote.

The vote was tied between staying and fighting, or leaving.

So three families including yours and mine were elected to decide what the women of the colony would do.

Your mother had asked,

August, the school teacher, to take the minutes of our meeting.

August came back to the colony just recently.

His family had been excommunicated years ago.

August had loved your mother since he was a boy.

Before we began, your grandmother, Agata, told us we had to honor our service to each other.

We had to represent it.

Just as the disciples were washed by Jesus at the Last Supper, knowing that his hour had come.

We only had 24 hours to imagine what world you would be born into.

It is a part of our faith to forgive.

We have always forgiven those who have wronged us.

Why not now?

Because now we know better.

We will be excommunicated, forced to leave the colony in disgrace if we do not forgive these men.

And if we are excommunicated, we forfeit our place in Heaven.

How could any of you live with the fear of that?

These are legitimate fears.

How can we address them?

The only important thing to establish is if we forgive the men.

So that we will be allowed to enter the gates of Heaven.

You can laugh all you like, Salome, but we will be forced to leave the colony if we don't forgive the men.

How will the Lord when he arrives find the women if we aren't in the colony?

Jesus is able to return to life, live for thousands of years and then drop down to earth from Heaven to scoop up his supporters, surely he'd also be able to locate a few women who left their colony.

Let's stay on track.

All right. I'll stay on track.

I cannot forgive them.

I will never forgive them.

I can't either.

But we want to enter the Kingdom of Heaven when we die.

We have everything we want here.

No.

Want less.

Does entering the Kingdom of Heaven mean nothing to any of you?

Surely there must be something worth living for in this life, not only in the next.

Autje!

- See you soon. It's all right.

-  Sorry.

It's all right.

It will be all right.

Your grandmother used to say,

"Find out where you can be of help

"and leave what you can't help behind."

I think that's easier when you're old like her.

So we must decide now to stay and fight, or leave.

Those are the options in front of us.

We will not do nothing.

I want to talk about my horses Ruth and Cheryl.

When Ruth and Cheryl are frightened by Dueck's dogs on the mile road that leads to the church, their initial instinct is to bolt.

Whoa!

These horses don't organize meetings to decide what they will do.

They run.

But, Greta, we are not animals.

We have been preyed upon like animals.

Maybe we should respond like animals.

In my lifetime,

I have seen horses confront angry dogs and try to stomp them to death.

Animals don't always flee.

Is this how we want to teach our daughters to defend themselves?

By fleeing?

Not fleeing but leaving.

I was just talking about leaving.

I would rather stand my ground and shoot each man in the heart and bury 'em in a pit than flee.

And I'll deal with God's wrath if I have to.

Salome, Aunt Greta is talking about leaving not fleeing.

The word "fleeing" wasn't what she meant.

Yeah. Please forgive my mother for using the wrong word.

It's a sin so outrageous that Salome has taken it upon herself to rectify for the sake of all humanity.

"Leaving" and "fleeing" are different words with different meanings.

They each say something about us.

August, what do you make of all of this?

Do you have an opinion too?

I think...

I think that it is possible to leave something or someone... in one frame of mind and arrive elsewhere in another entirely unexpected frame of mind.

I want to stay and fight.

But won't we lose the fight to the men and be forced to forgive them anyway?

I want to stay and fight too.

No one's surprised that you do.

All you do is fight.

Is this really how we are to decide the fates of all the women in this colony?

Just another vote where we put an X next to our position?

I thought we were here to do more than that.

You mean talk more about forgiving the men and doing nothing.

Everything else is insane.

But none of you will listen to reason.

Well, why are you here with us?

Why are you still here with us if that is what you believe?

Just leave with the rest of the do nothing women.

She is my daughter and I want her here with us.

Is forgiveness that's forced upon us true forgiveness?

Keep nonsense like that to yourself please.

Autje, get down!

Autje, listen to your mother!

Behave yourself.

Don't you hear the rafter's creaking?

Do you want the roof to cave in?

Many of us saw ourselves from above.

I'm not sure if it was God and we were seeing ourselves through his eyes.

Or if we just couldn't be there.

In our own bodies.

How'd you get up there?

It was a miracle.

A miracle from God.

-  Of course.

-  What else?

Where I come from, where your mother comes from, we didn't talk about our bodies.

So when something like this happened there was no language for it.

And without language for it, there was a gaping silence.

And in that gaping silence was the real horror.

Neitje's mother hanged herself after the attacks had gone on for a while.

It made us wonder, why did our feet keep moving forward when hers just couldn't.

What sets us apart from the ones who get left behind?

This is never going to end.

We'll be dead and they'll still be talking.

Or worse.

We'll have to live through it.

August, I think you should make lists of the pros and cons of both options.

"Staying and fighting" and "leaving."

Post it on the wall.

Make sure and write large.

Why?

We can't read it.

No, but we'll keep it here as an artifact for others to discover.

I think the first heading should say,

"staying and fighting" and under that write "pros".

Who will go first?

We're starting with staying and fighting, pros.

Why do we need this?

This is our home.

That's what you believe, it's not what everyone believes.

- Excuse me.

Forgive me.

Excuse me, um...

May I request that you take it in turns speaking so that I can understand what each of you is saying.

It takes me a second to transcribe.

Should we put up our hands as though we are children in your schoolhouse?

I...

I apologize.

We won't have to leave.

- Sorry.

- Will you just write it down?

Under pros.

Salome has had a brilliant idea that if we stay we won't have to leave.

We won't have to figure out where we are going or experience the uncertainty of not knowing where we are going.

We don't have a map.

That's absurd.

The only certainty we'll know is uncertainty, no matter where we are.

Neitje? Autje?

Do you have something to add to the list?

We won't have to leave the people we love.

Well, we could bring our loved ones with us if we leave.

How?

What does that mean?

That we move the whole colony?

What could that possibly mean?

We could create the possibility of a new order right here in a place that is familiar to us.

Not simply familiar, but a place that is ours.

Do we need to write the cons?

Isn't it obvious that we must stay and fight?

Cons. We won't be forgiven.

May I say something?

Please.

Would it be a good idea before we list the pros and cons of "staying and fighting" to talk about exactly what it is we're fighting for?

It's obvious.

We are fighting for our safety and for our freedom from attacks.

But what would that mean to us?

Perhaps we need a statement which describes what we want the colony to be like after winning the fight.

Perhaps we need to understand more what it is we are fighting to achieve, not only what we are fighting to destroy.

Are we staying or are we going?

Ona, please tell us more about the statement you're thinking about.

Men and women would make all decisions for the colony collectively.

Women would be allowed to think.

Girls will be taught to read and to write.

The schoolhouse must display a map of the world so that we can begin to understand our place in it.

A new religion, taken from the old but focused on love would be created by the women of the colony.

Our children would be safe.

"Collectively."

You sound like August's mother.

Ona, you're a dreamer.

We're women without a voice.

We have nothing to return to.

Even the animals are safer in their homes than we women are.

All we have are our dreams.

So of course we are dreamers.

And you want to hear my dream?

I dream that people who speak nonsense, who have no grasp on reality, are not put in charge of making statements.

What if the men refuse to meet our demands?

Sorry.

We'll kill them.

No, Ona.

What if the men who are in prison are not guilty?

Mother?

Autje.

Why are you asking if they're...?

Autje, shush.

We caught one of them.

I saw him.

But only one.

Yes, only one, but he named the others.

But what if he was lying?

We must consider this.

No! That is not our responsibility because we aren't in charge of whether or not they are punished.

We know that we've been attacked by men.

Not by ghosts or Satan as we were led to believe for so long.

We know that we've not imagined these attacks.

That we were made unconscious with cow tranquilizer.

We know that we are bruised, and infected, and pregnant, and terrified, and insane, and some of us are dead.

We know that we must protect our children.

Regardless of who is guilty.

All right, Salome. Thank you.

Please, sit down, hmm.

Hmm.

Shall we move on?

It is possible the men in prison are not guilty of the attacks, but are they guilty of not stopping the attacks?

Are they guilty of knowing about the attacks and doing nothing?

How should we know what they're guilty of or not?

But we do know.

We do know that the conditions have been created by men and that these attacks have been made possible because of the circumstances of the colony.

And those circumstances have been created and ordained by the men.

But wait, aren't you suggesting that the attackers are as much victims as the victims of the attacks?

That all of us, men and women are victims of the circumstances from which the colony has been created.

In a sense, yes.

So then, even if the court finds them guilty or innocent, they are... after all innocent.

Yes, I would say so.

- The elders called them evil.

-  That's not true.

It's the elder's quest for power that is responsible.

Because they needed to have those...

Those they'd have power over.

And those people are us.

And they have taught the lesson of power to the boys and men of the colony, and the boys and men have been excellent students.

Don't we all want some sort of power?

I think so.

But I'm not sure.

But we caught them.

We caught them.

Yes, you did.

Then why are you making it so complicated?

This is very, very boring.

We could ask the men to leave.

Ask the men to leave?

None of us have ever asked the men for anything.

Not a single thing.

Not even for the salt to be passed.

Not even for a penny, or a moment alone.

Or to take the washing in, or to open a curtain, or to go easy on the small yearlings.

Or to put your hand on the small of my back while I try again for the 12th or 13th time to push a baby out of my body.

Isn't it interesting that the one and only request we women would have of the men would be for them to leave?

Asking the men to leave is not an option.

Oh!

I'd like you to imagine

Ruth and Cheryl.

No. Not again.

Please stop.

Look. August is still taking the minutes.

I can't believe August is still taking the minutes.

Sometimes I think people laugh as hard as they'd like to cry.

August, you must think we're all lunatics.

I don't.

And it doesn't matter what I think, anyway.

Is that true?

Do you really think it doesn't matter what you think?

How would you feel if in your entire life it never mattered what you thought?

But I'm not here to think.

I'm here to take the minutes of your meeting.

But if in your entire life you truly felt it didn't matter what you thought, how would that make you feel?

When we've liberated ourselves, we will have to ask ourselves who we are.

Will we be done by supper time?

I have to give little Miep her antibiotics.

Where did you get antibiotics?

She walked.

She walked for a day and a half to the mobile clinic with Miep on her back.

The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in loving kindness and forgiveness.

The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in loving kindness and forgiveness.

The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in loving kindness and forgiveness.

I have to hide the antibiotics in Miep's applesauce or she won't swallow them.

The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in loving kindness and forgiveness.

The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in loving kindness and forgiveness.

The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in loving kindness and forgiveness.

The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger...

Forgive me.

They're too big for my mouth.

The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in loving kindness and forgiveness.

The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in loving kindness and forgiveness.

Well, let's take a break.

- Melvin.

You're it.

Not one word about my smoking.

Honestly, I'm sick of it.

Okay,

I'm coming over here.

Watch out!

Is she always going to be like this now?

Like what?

A man.

Is Nettie always going to be a man now?

Later, we understood that Nettie didn't become a man because of what happened.

Nettie had never felt like a woman.

Now pretending had become impossible.

Is my brother listening?

Hello, little brother.

I don't know if the baby was yours, or if it was one of your friends.

I think it was likely yours though... because there was something wrong with it.

I loved it.

I think.

Isn't that strange?

I won't speak of it.

Or anything else.

Ever again.

But...

But what?

She doesn't speak anymore.

You all right?

She speaks to the children.

Kind of.

I think they call her Melvin.

You know, during the Second World War in Italy, civilians would hide in bomb shelters.

Volunteers were needed to power the generators that provided electricity.

They rode bikes.

And when you were swinging from the rafter earlier,

I was, uh, reminded of this.

You would have been the perfect volunteer.

If we were in a bomb shelter.

Where would I ride the bike to in such a small space?

Oh, well, uh, the bike would be stationary.

I have to get the water to the horses.

Watch this.

Oh!

I'll bet you didn't learn how to do things like that when you went to university.

Only facts about stationary bicycles in far off places.

I suppose I shouldn't be too sad then.

That I won't ever go.

Why were you forced to leave the colony?

My mother questioned things.

She questioned God?

Not God.

Power.

The rules made in the name of God.

And she encouraged others to question things too.

Like Ona?

Yes.

Ona knew her well.

Did she die?

But sometimes, listening to you all speaking today

I can hear her so clearly.

Why did the elders let you come back?

Well, I went to university so I could serve a purpose and teach the boys.

Too late.

I want to help.

And I don't know how.

You came back for Ona, didn't you?

The way you look at her is funny.

I don't know why she won't just marry you.

You both say so much that doesn't make sense.

Mama.

All residents, please come out of your homes to be counted for the 2010 census.

Hey, hey, hey.

Shoo, shoo, shoo!

Away. Away!

Please come out and be counted now.

Please come out of your homes to be counted for the 2010 census.

All residents must come out of their homes to be counted for the 2010 census.

Whoo!

All right.

You want to try this one?

This is the 2010 census.

Please come out of your homes to be counted for the 2010 census.

- Tickle, tickle, tickle.

I'm here to collect data for the 2010 census.

Please come out of your homes now to be counted.

Let's go.

Why?

Let's just... Let's go.

The ladies standing in front of me.

- How old are you?

- I'm 15.

- I'm 16.

Okay.

So you must have boyfriends.

Oh!

- No. We don't have boyfriends.

- No boyfriend?

I'll see you ladies again.

- Mm-hmm

-  Take care.

Where is Autje?

Well, we must begin without her.

Thank you.

Were you smoking?

Is that any of your business?

Please.

I can't live a second longer!

Autje!

-  Autje!

Autje, wait until

I get ahold of you.

The census taker just told us that one of our men is returning from the city late tonight.

They need more bail money for the attackers.

Which man?

Your Klaas.

So time is of the essence.

Everyone get back to your seats.

August, please, pros for leaving.

Pros for leaving.

We will be gone.

We will be safe.

Maybe not.

The first is most definitely a fact, that if we leave we will be gone.

Do we really need to state the obvious over and over?

Yes, Autje.

We will see a bit of the world.

Let's move on to the cons of leaving.

We, the women, will decide what happens in these meetings.

Not a two-bit failed farmer who must teach.

You have been invited here.

You have been invited here to listen to what we have to say and write it down.

Nothing more.

Just listen.

Mariche!

Klaas will be returning soon and you are wasting time.

He will come to your house just long enough to take his animals in order to sell for bail money that will see the rapists return to the colony and he will lay his hands on you and on your children.

And you, as always, do nothing, but fire away at us with all of this rage.

I would like to apologize for wrongly attempting to nudge the proceedings.

That's not my place.

Mejal!

I'll stop.

Mama.

What's the matter?

What's the matter?

What is it? Hmm?

Miep, what is it?

I hurt.

It's all right.

It's all right.

It's all right.

There are no cons of leaving.

It's all right.

Not to worry, Nettie.

If we do leave the colony, how will we live with the pain of never seeing our brothers and our sons again?

The men?

Time will heal.

Our freedom and safety are the ultimate goals.

And it is men who prevent us from achieving those goals.

But not all men.

Perhaps not men, but a way of seeing the world, and us women, which has been allowed to take hold of men's hearts and minds.

So if we leave... if we leave

I will never see my brothers again?

Who will take care of them?

Of them all?

We can't know if we will stay or leave before we resolve these last-minute concerns.

I wouldn't call the future of our relationship with the boys and men we love

"last-minute concerns."

There we go.

It was all waiting to happen before it happened.

You could look back and follow the breadcrumbs along the path that led to violence.

When we looked back, we could see that it had been everywhere, whether it was happening yet or not.

Hi.

Hi.

I'll get you some water.

There's no cup or anything.

It's good that you're here, August.

To remind us of what's possible.

Because it's easy to forget.

I'm so sorry, Ona.

One day I'd like to hear that from someone who should be saying it.

Why does love...

The absence of love, the end of love, the need for love, result in so much violence?

Ona.

Ona.

I could take care of you and your child.

I would like to.

I, um...

I know, but you don't have to say the words.

If I were married,

I wouldn't be myself.

So the person you love would be gone.

Your child...

If we stay and we don't win the fight, my child will be given to another family here.

Maybe even the family of my attacker.

If we stay and don't win the fight.

You won't let that happen. No.

No.

No, I won't.

August, we need to discuss options for the men and the older boys, if the women decide to leave.

Which is a waste of time because we're not leaving.

The men should leave with us if they wish.

Then what on earth is the point of us leaving?

Well, they could be allowed to join the women later once the women have established themselves and are thriving.

Should we add

"thriving as a collective, literate community"?

Literate's your word.

Not ours.

We don't need your university language to make our plans.

Put it in.

We know what it means.

Continue, Greta.

Young boys, simple-minded boys of any age,

Cornelius who's confined to a wheelchair, will accompany the women.

I vote for the first option.

The men should leave with us if they wish.

The first option is ridiculous and should be crossed off the list.

Why are some ideas written down and considered, and others crossed out?

I want to leave.

I'd like to strangle myself.

Mariche, it's possible that all the men would choose to leave with us.

And then all we'd be doing is recreating our colony with all of its dangers elsewhere.

And the men would definitely leave with us because they can't survive without us.

Well, not for longer than a day or two.

We have not decided to leave.

I'd like to remind everyone of that.

And how can we leave at all if we've never been allowed to even see a map of the world?

I can secure a world map for you.

I also have a, um, map of this specific region.

Well, that will do.

It's not like we are planning to travel the planet.

Perhaps we are.

Did you know that the migration period for butterflies and dragonflies is so long that it's often only the grandchildren that arrive at the intended destination?

Yes. So, it...

Yes.

Perhaps, if we went beyond where the map showed us, we could create our own map as we go.

So now you want to leave, Ona?

Are you all right,

Mejal?

Nope. She's having one of her episodes.

Father Almighty, in all humility and supplication we ask Thee for Thy abundant kindness at this moment.

We beseech Thee to have mercy on our sister Mejal.

- Please, in your beneficence, heal her.

- And please...

...we ask of Thee, envelop her in your strength and everlasting love, and please drive out the sickness which afflicts her now.

Help me up.

Praise be to God.

Why is it only Mejal has these...?

Be quiet.

We were all attacked.

Not all of us need to draw so much attention to ourselves.

What attention?

I speak less than all of you put together.

How have I offended you?

You have these attacks.

You smoke.

Why? Why is it so much harder for you than for us?

We were all attacked.

All of us.

We are wasting our time by passing this burden, this sack of stones, from one to the next, by pushing our pain away.

Let's absorb it ourselves.

Let's inhale it.

Let's digest it.

Let's process it into fuel.

Speak, Mejal.

We are listening.

They made us disbelieve ourselves.

That was worse than...

Mejal.

Klaas, when he returns, may take horses or livestock that we would need along the way.

Along the way?

We're not leaving.

You are changing your mind, Ona.

I don't believe that's a sin, is it?

How will we be forgiven for all this?

How will we be forgiven, if not by the elders whom we have disobeyed?

Perhaps there will be other elders or men of God who will be able to forgive our sins.

We do not need to be forgiven by the men of God for protecting our children from the depraved actions of vicious men who are often the very same men we're meant to ask for forgiveness!

If God is a loving God then...

He will forgive us himself.

If God is a vengeful God then He has created us in His image.

If God is omnipotent, then why has He not protected the women and girls of this colony?

I will destroy any living thing that harms my child.

I will tear it limb from limb.

I will desecrate its body and I will bury it alive.

I will challenge God on the spot to strike me dead if I have sinned by protecting my child from evil, and by destroying that evil that it may not harm another!

I will lie,

I will hunt, I will kill.

I will dance on graves and I will burn forever in hell before I allow another man to satisfy his violent urges with the body of my four-year-old child!

I suggest we think about what is good.

"Whatever is true,

"whatever is honorable,

"whatever is just,

"whatever is pure,

"whatever is pleasing,

"whatever is commendable,

"if there is any excellence

"and if there is anything worthy of praise,

"think about these things

"and the peace of God be with you."

I will become a murderer if I stay.

I know what these are.

These are letters.

But what are these?

They're commas.

They signify a short pause, or a breath in the text.

There's also a butterfly called a comma.

- Is that so?

- Mm-hmm.

-  Salome.

If you will become a murderer by staying here in the colony, side by side with the men who are responsible for the attacks, then you must, to protect your own soul, leave the colony.

We are not all murderers.

Not yet.

I have done what the verse from Philippians instructed, which is to think about what is good, what is just, what is pure, what is excellent.

Pacifism.

Pacifism is good.

Any violence is unjustifiable.

By staying here, we women will be betraying the central tenet of our faith which is pacifism, because by staying we will knowingly be placing ourselves in a direct collision course with violence, either by us or against us.

This colony is the only home

I've ever known.

And I don't want to leave.

But by staying, we'll be inviting harm.

We will be in a state of war.

We will turn this colony into a battlefield.

We cannot become murderers.

And we cannot endure any more violence, which is why we must leave.

I've also been thinking about the verse from Philippians and I've been thinking about what is good.

Freedom is good.

It is better than slavery.

Forgiveness is good.

It's better than revenge.

And hope for the unknown is good, it is better than hatred of the familiar.

And what about security, and safety, and home, and family?

What about marriage, and love, Ona?

I don't know about those things, any of them.

Except for love and... even love is mysterious to me.

And I believe that my home is with my mother, and my sister, and my unborn child, wherever that may be.

Will you not hate that child?

That child's the child of a man who inspires violent thoughts in you.

I already love this child more than anything.

He or she is as innocent and lovable as the evening sun.

So too was the child's father when he was born.

But, if you're saying that forgiveness is better than revenge...

Aren't you saying that we must stay here and forgive the men?

We cannot forgive because we are forced to.

But, with some distance perhaps I am able to understand how these crimes may have occurred.

And with that distance, maybe I am able to pity these men, perhaps forgive them.

And even love them.

Not fighting. But moving.

Always moving. Never fighting.

Just moving.

Never fighting. Just moving.

Never fighting. Always moving.

Would you snap out of it?

You snap out of it.

All of you snap out of it.

Have you lost your minds?

The sun is gone.

I want to tell another story about Ruth and Cheryl.

I was always frightened of the northern road out of the colony.

There are so many gullies on either side of the road.

The buggy used to lurch side to side.

Ruth and Cheryl were simply following my commands of the reins, but, they were jerky and frenetic.

And it was dangerous.

It was only when I learned to focus my gaze far down ahead of me and not on the road immediately in front of Ruth and Cheryl, that I started to feel safe.

Leaving will give us the more farseeing perspective we need to forgive.

Which is to love properly and keep the peace, according to our faith.

Therefore, our leaving wouldn't be an act of cowardice or abandonment.

Let's see you go.

It wouldn't be because we were excommunicated or exiled.

It would be a supreme act of faith...

Come on, let's go. Let's go.

...a step towards love and forgiveness.

Leaving is how we demonstrate our faith.

We are leaving because our faith is stronger than the rules.

Bigger than our life.

I'm sorry.

But I think I might be dying.

Mother, you're not dying.

Your glasses need cleaning.

Why are you laughing?

We cannot leave.

We...

It would be better to stay and fight than leave.

Do you really mean that you want to stay and not fight?

Because when was the last time you had the strength to stand up to the aggression of Klaas, to protect your children,

- or to get out of harm's way?

-  Who are you to tell me what kind of wife and mother to be when you are neither one yourself?

You are a spinster. A whore!

- An unwed mother!

- Stop.

Ona was made unconscious and raped like the rest of us.

How dare you call her a whore!

Mariche, are you not afraid that your own sweet boys will become monsters like their father because you do nothing to protect them?

- Stop it!

- Nothing to educate them, nothing to teach them the horror of their father's ways...

I have heard enough!

Do you women realize we are talking about leaving?

We are a large group.

Many things could go wrong.

And time is fleeting.

For the love of our Lord Jesus Christ and precious Savior, shut your pie holes, please!

How dare you pass judgment on me?

It wasn't a judgment.

It was a question.

Tell her you're sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry that what I said hurt you.

Oh, fuck it off!

Sit down, Mariche!

It's "fuck off" I think.

Shh!

I am sorry.

I'm saying sorry, not just to leave the hurt behind, but because I feel truly that I should not have said something harmful to you.

And Mariche, I'm sorry because you do not need or deserve any more harm.

Who are you?

Who are any of you to pretend

I have had a choice?

I am also sorry, Mariche.

I didn't try to protect you or your children from Klaas.

And what you say is true.

You had no choice.

You forgave him, again and again, as you were told to.

As I told you to.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

It's not only the men and boys who have been excellent students.

I think Mariche, we are all very sorry.

What you were required to endure was a...

Misuse of forgiveness.

Is there such a thing?

A forgiveness that is not good?

Perhaps forgiveness can in some instances be confused with permission.

What in heaven's name?

What is it?

Julius, what is it?

Nettie, please.

Make an exception and tell us what is happening.

What has happened to him?

Nettie, be realistic.

Tell us what has happened to Julius.

Speak. Just this once.

What's wrong, sweetheart?

My nose.

There's a cherry up my nose.

Okay, well, blow.

- Harder. Again.

There you go.

We have no cherries in the colony.

Klaas sometimes brings them back from the city.

Who gave you the cherries, Julius?

Papa.

Why don't you...

You go and play with Nettie, all right?

Have we made a decision?

Are we leaving?

Yes.

We are leaving because...

We know why we are leaving.

We are leaving because we cannot stay.

Hmm.

We will take young boys of 12 with us.

Allow the men to join the women later under certain conditions.

- No.

- No.

Aaron. I know.

Aaron is just over 12.

Just barely.

Why would boys of 13 and 14 be left behind?

Why wouldn't they leave with us?

Surely, we don't have to be afraid of the boys of this age.

August, you're the boys' teacher.

What is your feeling about this?

Do boys of that age pose a risk to our girls and women?

Yes. Possibly.

Boys of 13 or 14 are capable of causing great damage to girls and women.

And to each other.

It is a brash age.

They are possessed of reckless urges, physical exuberance, intense curiosity that often results in injury.

Unbridled emotion, including deep tenderness and empathy, and not quite enough experience or brain development to fully understand or appreciate the consequences of their words or actions.

They are like the yearlings.

Young, awkward, gleeful, powerful.

They're tall, muscular, sexually inquisitive creatures, with little impulse control, but they are children.

They are children and they can be taught.

I'm a two-bit schoolteacher, a failed farmer, and above all a believer.

And I believe that with guidance, firm love and patience, these boys are capable of relearning their roles as males in the colony.

I believe in what the great poet

Samuel Taylor Coleridge thought were the cardinal rules of early education.

"To work by love

"and so generate love.

"To habituate the mind

"to intellectual accuracy and truth.

"To excite imaginative power."

He said,

"Little is taught by contest or dispute,

"everything by sympathy and love."

I believe the boys should be allowed to leave with the women...

Providing the women choose to leave.

It was a yes or no question.

You shit like any other man, why don't you talk like one?

Sorry.

I have a proposal to make.

We have to protect all of our children.

Not only our daughters.

Every boy under 15 and the ones who need special care must accompany the women.

How do you mean must?

What if they refuse?

What if they don't want to leave?

We can't carry teenagers on our backs.

We will try to influence our sons.

But we cannot force them, and they might refuse, it's true.

August... you would stay and teach the boys who remain?

Of course.

He's right outside.

Klaas?

He has Ruth and Cheryl.

Everybody, back to your houses and pack up.

If anyone asks, we were quilting.

August, uh, get the map.

Neitje and Autje, you must run right now to every house and tell the women, we are leaving.

Tell them to pack up everything they can and to meet us outside the washhouse an hour after sunrise.

We need to get an early start in the morning.

Let's all meet back here at sunrise.

All of us.

An hour after sunrise.

We congregate on the road by the washhouse.

- Do we bring...

- Everything. Bring everything.

Why?

- After sunrise... All right?

- Wake up.

Tomorrow one hour after sunrise.

We're leaving after sunrise.

We meet an hour after sunrise on this road.

Bring your buggies.

Thank you, sister.

Who can get home the quickest, huh?

She has a cricket in her hands.

You do?

Can I see? Okay.

Yes. Bed time.

Yes.

Don't go.

Stay with me tonight.

Or I will go with you.

If I don't go home, it'll draw attention to all of us.

- Mariche.

- Go home, Mother.

I'll see you at sunrise.

They said later, it should have taken longer to pack up a whole life.

It was disappointing to realize that everything that ever mattered to you could be gathered up in a few short hours.

We would leave only traces of ourselves.

Go. Go.

Psst. August!

Come sit with me.

Here's the map.

Where are we?

Here.

Here?

Mm-hmm.

This is where we are.

This is north, south, east, and west.

But the map moves.

How do you know which way it should be facing?

Celestial navigation.

I can show you.

Do you know of the Southern Cross?

Mm-hmm.

You and the women can use the Southern Cross to navigate.

If you, um, make your right hand into a fist...

Align the first knuckle with the axis of the Cross.

And then the tip of your thumb here will indicate south.

Will you show the others?

We will have a lesson in navigation.

Did you already know about this little trick?

Of course, I did.

I wish there was something

I could teach you that you didn't already know.

What will become of you when we leave?

You make a fist with your right hand.

And point your two knuckles to the Southern Cross.

It's called celestial navigation.

Point these two knuckles.

Like that?

Mm-hmm.

And wherever your thumb is pointing that's south.

We like to put frames around things.

Even when they are spilling out the edges.

So, we gathered one last time in the hayloft, where so much had been said.

So much that your grandmother would have told you, had you ever met.

Is he gone?

He's sleeping.

Dead to the world.

He was very drunk.

And he caught me sneaking back into the house late, and then he went to the barn and found we had taken the horses.

Mariche, did you tell him what we are planning?

She did. But only because he wouldn't stop hitting me and she was trying to distract him.

I don't think he believed me.

And even if he did,

I don't think he'll remember.

He'll be passed out all morning I'm sure.

But I also told him because

I suddenly felt very...

We have decided that we want...

That we are...

We are entitled to three things.

What are they?

We want our children to be safe.

We want...

We want to be steadfast in our faith.

And we want to think.

Yes.

Praise God.

Yeah. We all want that.

Just...

August, you can speak whenever you want.

You don't have to raise your hand.

I...

It's all right.

It wasn't important.

Oh.

Are the children clean and ready?

Thank you, Melvin.

Thank you for saying my name.

We hid Ruth and Cheryl for you.

They are ready to go.

Really?

Well, oh, my girls.

Has Aaron readied the horses for us?

What? Well, where is he?

Where is he?

- No.

- Speak to me.

-  You're safe, Melvin.

- Please, speak to me.

No, no, no. I won't harm you.

I'm not your enemy!

You have to be calm, Salome.

- No!

- Aaron will be found.

I'm not leaving without him.

Salome, come back!

What if she doesn't convince him?

Mother?

Breathe.

Breathe.

We are going to go now.

I'm all right. Please go.

Come on, let's go.

Now?

Yes.

Make a list, August.

A list of what?

Of good things.

Of plans, of memories.

Whatever you feel goes into a good list.

What we, the women will want there.

Please write it down.

August.

Thank you for all you've done.

We are all so proud of you.

And your mother would be proud too.

I'll make a list.

This is going to be a difficult trip.

Today is the day the Lord hath made.

Rejoice... and be glad in it.

Go join the others.

Please.

I will not be buried in this colony.

Get me into a buggy now and let me die on the trail.

But what about August?

Oh!

He'll be fine.

He'll be fine.

Hang on with both hands.

Ona!

I will always love you.

She loves you too, August.

She loves everyone.

Sun.

Stars.

Pails.

The harvest.

Numbers.

Window.

Straw.

Sounds.

Beams.

Love.

All right. We'll go.

Language.

Wind.

Women.

Salome?

We may need to protect ourselves.

Where is Aaron?

He's in the buggy, waiting.

You convinced him to leave?

You may need this.

For protection.

Did you?

- Did you have...?

- Yes!

He's coming with me.

He's my child.

Goodbye, August.

Good luck.

Please take care of Ona and her baby.

Of course. I promise.

Wait. I need to give you something.

No! I have to go!

Here.

Why have you got a gun, August?

Don't kill yourself, August.

You have important work to do.

You are the boys' teacher.

Don't come back.

Don't ever come back.

Any of you.

Oh, wait. I need...

No.

Please.

Please, Salome, give these to Ona.

But, no...

But she can't read them.

Her child will read them.

No, August.

The purpose was for you to take the minutes.

We'll meet again.

We'll meet again.

Girls, now, those can go in the back.

That's fine.

We have more room back here.

No, but thank you.

Do you have any more room?

We have room for one more.

Or two little ones.

She can sit on my lap.

It's sturdy now.

Come with me.

Follow me.

It's all right, sisters. It's all right.

Up, up.

There you go.

Hold the baby for now.

You'll be riding with your brother.

I need a little more rope to tie this down.

I have some here.

Are we all in?

All right.

So happy. Come on.

Come on. Here.

Shh, shh, shh.

Your story will be different from ours.
