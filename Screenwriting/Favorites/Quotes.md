Quer cu?
Eita macho bom
Elas pintam
If you like me then you like fun
Eat my ass, eat it fast
What is your penis doing on a dead girl’s phone?
No! I’m done saving your ass! I’m done believing in you! I’m done loving you! Get out of this house!
Imagina a rola!
Eu até sei me virar sozinha, mas eu gosto, eu me amarro quando é você que me vira de lado, bota forte, mete marcha, me sarra em cima da moto. Acelera, tu não é o brabo?
Faz para mim.

I have a record of an injunction brought against your project by Trisha Stanley, advocating for the thousands of citizens living in low-income housing who would be displaced by your project.
Ten days after, Miss Stanley was murdered.
Your attorney struck down the injunction, and your project went forward unopposed.
So my question is, Senator Trucco, did you have Trisha Stanley murdered?
Did you convince your tenant, Linda Morelli, to testify that Trisha Stanley was killed by her boyfriend, David Allen?
Explain why your eviction suit against Miss Morelli was dropped despite her inability to pay rent.
Is it because her lost rent money was nothing compared to the millions you made once Miss Stanley was out of your way?
Answer the question, Senator.
Why was Linda Morelli granted these concessions?
I am sorry, Senator, if you do not have the time to answer for who bore the real cost of your development.
Not just Trisha Stanley and her boyfriend, David Allen, who served 21 years in prison…
But the thousands who were displaced in the name of lining your pockets…
The majority of whom are poor, powerless, and didn’t bear the color of skin desirable to your business interests.
You tore a community apart. You tore families apart. You destroyed lives, Senator.
Admit it. Admit you killed Trisha Stanley and had my client, David Allen, set up for her murder.

As a kid I used to look through all your journals. Years of meeting meticulously documented. It’s impressive. There’s only one day unaccounted for. One day in years. The day you met with the prosecutor on the David Allen’s case. Did the Ada on that case tell you that someone had committed perjury. One summer after that verdict you received your federal appointment. You were an underdog for the job. Mama’s always said you friend Arthur Truco put the good word for you. Is this woman, Keating, putting these crazy ideas in your head? Your whole life you have prided yourself on the fact that you don’t lie. And now I’m sitting here accusing you of grave judicial misconduct and your answer is where did i get the idea from? Tell me I’m wrong. Tell me you didn’t get to be where you are on the back of a man who’s gonna die.

Get out. After all I’ve done for you. You ungrateful little twat. Get the hell out of my house.

I gave you the chance to explain it. You just lied to my face. I’m not doing this. I’m not letting you ruin me. And risk my entire career in the process? Did you really think I would do that? That I wouldn’t remember how familiar this all feels? You don’t get to do this anymore. You can’t use people and expect them to stick around. Maybe this is all who you’ve always been and I was just blind to it. All the ambition to just make up for the fact that you knew deep inside that there’s nothing good inside of you. Shame on me for expecting more.

This Laurel. She’s always sticking her head where it don’t belong. Asking questions that don’t concern her. She lied to me about the trophy that night, stole prom queen’s ring and even suggested that I killed Rebecca.

How do you sleep at night? 
Alone. And in very comfortable sheets. I like expensive bottle of vodka.
Emotional reason. It can’t just be financial.
Phelip, Frank is a child of incest.
A child is a chance to do right. Make it right this time.

I said wait! My ring might be in one of those! Enough about the ring, Frodo!
Let the clients get in the head.
Ameaça de suicídio.

What do you do when you're not sure?
That's the topic of my sermon today.
Last year when Predisent Kennedy was assassinated, who among us did not experience the most profound disorientation?
Despair?
Which way? What now?
What do I say to my kids?
What do I tell myself?
It was a time of people sitting together, bound together by a common feeling of hopelessness.
But think of that.
Your bond with your fellow being was your despair.
It was a public experience.
It was awful, but we were in it together.
How much worse is it then for the lone man, the lone woman, stricken by a private calamity?
"No one knows I'm sick." "No one knows I've lost my last real friend."
"No one knows I've done something wrong."
Imagine the isolation.
Now you see the world as through a window.
On one side of the glass, happy untroubled people, and on the other side, you.
There are those of you in church today who know exactly the crisis of faith I describe, and I wanna say to you:
doubt can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty.
When you are lost, you are not alone.
