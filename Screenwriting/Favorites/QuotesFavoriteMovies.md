# HTGAWM
All men or persons who stand bound by recognizance or who otherwise have business before this court may now appear and they shall be heard.
In July of 1993, Miss Morelli, you faced an eviction suit by the owner of your building.
Why were you being evicted?
For failure to make rent.
I was three months behind.
My husband, he gambled, and...
ANNALISE: So you were being thrown on the street, and yet four days after you testified to seeing David Allen, the suit was dropped.
According to the records we've obtained, you never paid the rent you owed.
Is that because your payment was your testimony in the David Allen trial?
(SCOFFS)
Can you tell the court who owned your building?
Green Ash properties.
That's Art Trucco's company, no?
The same Art Trucco who's gone on to become
State Senator Trucco?
That is correct. But I...
Did anyone associated with Mr. Trucco tell you that your rent problems would disappear if you testified that you saw David Allen carrying the gun that day?
CLARK: Objection, Your Honor.
The witness cannot speak for the intentions of Senator Trucco.
ANNALISE: Which is why I would like to ask the state at this time to subpoena Senator Trucco.
What? No!
My client is set to die based on the perjured testimony of Miss Morelli.
That is an egregious lie.
Perjured testimony bought by Senator Trucco.
Would the court like to be put on record for refusing to hear his testimony, all the while
Senator Trucco is sitting in his corner office right across the street?
Please, Your Honor.
Senator Trucco, in 1993, you developed the land at Penn's Landing into what is now Trucco Plaza.
Is this correct?
ART: Let's see.
I know this. You know this.
The few million people, annually, that traffic the plaza know this.
Can we cut to the chase here?
My constituents expect me to make the most of my time.
I have a record of an injunction brought against your project by Trisha Stanley, advocating for the thousands of citizens living in low-income housing who would be displaced by your project.
Was there a question in there?
ANNALISE: Ten days after,
Miss Stanley was murdered.
Your attorney struck down the injunction, and your project went forward unopposed.
So my question is,
Senator Trucco, did you have
Trisha Stanley murdered?
(SPECTATORS MURMURING)
Are you out of your mind?
Your Honor, this has gone on long enough.
Did you convince your tenant,
Linda Morelli, to testify that
Trisha Stanley was killed by her boyfriend, David Allen?
You are way off base.
I recommend you rein this in.
Explain why your eviction suit against Miss
Morelli was dropped despite her inability to pay rent.
Is it because her lost rent money was nothing compared to the millions you made once Miss Stanley was out of your way?
(GAVEL BANGS)
Answer the question, Senator.
Why was Linda Morelli granted these concessions?
Mr. Chief Justice,
I have extended great deference to the court by showing up here today.
But I am not gonna put up with this any longer.
I am sorry, Senator, if you do not have the time to answer for who bore the real cost of your development.
CLARK: Objection!
Not just
Trisha Stanley and her boyfriend, David Allen, who served 21 years in prison...
CLARK: Your Honor, please!
But the thousands who were displaced in the name of lining your pockets...
The majority of whom are poor, powerless, and didn't bear the color of skin desirable to your business interests.
You tore a community apart.
You tore families apart.
You destroyed lives, Senator.
Admit it.
Admit you killed Trisha Stanley and had my client,
David Allen, set up for her murder.
That is enough!
Do you hear me?
You say another word, and I'll have no choice but to throw you in jail.
If I wanted to be her before...
That's not something she can teach us.
Here's a question, if she gets disbarred, does it go on our records, too?
CRIER: Will the defendant please rise?
JUDGE:
Miss Keating, may I say, we are beyond dismayed by the conduct you've exhibited here today.
You've operated with blatant disrespect for this court and its protocols, and your argument, when isolated from all the bluster, seems to consist entirely of speculation.
The case against your client seems to be built on the same ground, rooted singularly in an eyewitness testimony that we no longer have faith in.
As a result, it is our recommendation that the District
Attorney's office open an investigation into the actions of Senator Trucco and the state's original witness,
Linda Morelli.
(SPECTATORS MURMUR)
Now, Mr. Allen.
We have no choice but to vacate the judgment...
(SPECTATORS GASP) conviction, and sentence of death, and prohibit a re-trial.
You are a free man.
(GAVEL BANGS)
Let me know what you have.
(CHUCKLING) What?
For dinner tonight.
(SIGHS)
Thank you.
(VOICE BREAKING) Thank you.
Go be with your family.
ANNALISE: Previously on
How To Get Away With Murder...
I'm representing one of the defendants,
Rebecca Sutter.
Does anyone else know about this?
Only Rebecca and
I know it exists.
Sam? Why is your penis on a dead girl's phone?
Did Lila ever share any details about this man?
Just that he was married.
She called him Mr. Darcy.
LAUREL:
Thank you for picking me,
making me Frank's girl.
I have a boyfriend.
I know how you got
Rebecca's confession tape.
We both know what person in this house you did it for, and it wasn't me.
Rebecca?
Wes, you can't trust Annalise.
What happened?
The wallpaper, Wes.
Look at the wallpaper.
What the hell are you doing here?
Your husband's Mr. Darcy.
-  Mrs. Walker.
Do you have time for  your future mother-in-law?
I'm not signing the prenup.
You stubborn bitch!
- Michaela.
- Hey.
Tonight is gonna be the heezy, fo' sheezy...
Hi, there.
Who is this?
Sasha... His girlfriend.
I know you didn't kill Lila Stangard.
And we both know who did...
Help me catch him.
Lila was pregnant.
That's the evidence we need to tie Sam to her?
Plug it into his computer.
It'll download all his phone information.
She took it. Did you bring your car?
He kissed me... So I'd lie to you.
He knew she was pregnant.
You're fired.
No.
Since Lila was pregnant,
I'm demanding that they collect
DNA samples of all the men in her life...
Including her teachers.
I know nothing... About you, us.
Why are you doing this?
You knew she was pregnant.
How stupid could you be? Bonnie?
Of course she'd tell me.
All right, just...
Annie, wait.
I lied, yes, but only because I was afraid you'd think I killed her.
- Didn't you?
- No. God, no.
Annie, please. J...
You lie so much,
- your words mean nothing to me.
You mean nothing to me.
Will you just stop for one second?!
No! I'm done saving your ass!
I'm done believing in you!
I'm done loving you! Get out of this house!
I am begging you... Do not give up on me.
- I already have.
- I'm your husband. I love you.
Get out of this house, or I'm gonna call 911!
I am not leaving until you talk to me!
If one of these idiots touches my car,
I'm gonna run them over.
It's Rebecca. Don't leave me a message.
Still not picking up?
Hey, how do you know that she's even at Annalise's?
I mean, maybe she got hungry or went to score some drugs.
She went there.
I know that that's what you keep saying, but I'm suggesting otherwise.
I mean, even if she's there, what does it matter?
- We have to study. 
- The exam...
Sam killed Lila, okay?
That's why she's going over there.
She's trying to prove it.
I'm not a violent man, Annie.
Everyone's violent given the chance.
No. Not me. You know that.
I tried to believe you this whole time.
Just calm down. I didn't listen to myself.
I am still the man you married.
You are not that man anymore!
And I don't think you ever were, which is why you chose me, isn't it?
I've been the window dressing for you...
The black woman on your arm so you can hide, so that people only saw the good guy.
And maybe it took me 20 years to see it, but I do now... I see it!
And that's why you killed Lila...
Because she was pregnant, and you knew that if it got out, people would see you for the pathetic man you are!
If you think I killed her, why not just go to the police?
Why get them to run a DNA test instead?
It's so you can cover your own ass, because that's who you are...
Some scared little girl who pretends to be strong but is really just weak and selfish.
I did everything I could to protect you!
You've done nothing but make my life miserable!
I've been screwing another man.
Wait. You're serious?
This isn't a-a joke?
I don't care if you believe me.
Just drive faster.
Are you hearing this? I mean...
Why would Annalise defend Rebecca if she thought Sam was involved?
Because I said I'd go to the police if she didn't.
Right.
You blackmailed Annalise.
The kid that was so scared that he almost crapped his pants on the first day of class.
- This is ridiculous. 
- Connor, shut up.
You think Sam killed Lila?
Yes.
This night just gets better and better.
His name is Nate.
And, boy, is he good to me.
He knows me...
Just what I like and how I like it.
He knows how to make me scream and groan and sweat.
And so I let him take me wherever he wants...
- On this counter, on my desk, in our bed.
- You hypocrite.
- Just thinking about him right now makes me...
- Shaming me for cheating all this time.
Which is how I could sleep with you all these months, because I would think about him and I'd be able to stand you on top of me!
And I think of Lila every time
I try to get off with you!
I bet you did. Killing her?
You enjoyed it, didn't you? Strangling her?
Feeling the life go out of her body?
You still think about it, don't you?
Your hand around her neck while you were still inside of her.
It's exciting you right now, isn't it?
Remembering it?
You want to do it to me now, don't you?
Go ahead. Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me!
You're a monster.
"Monster," Is that all you got?
You can do better than that.
You want the truth?
You're nothing but a piece of ass.
That's what I saw when I first talked to you in the office that day...
'Cause I knew you'd put out.
That's all you're really good for...
Dirty, rough sex that I'm too ashamed to tell anyone about.
That's how foul you are, you disgusting slut.
Well...

The justice system doesn't always reward tell the truth but those who have the power to create their own. It's a fact that pisses me off since I've heard this case. 
Make an unjust system just. 
Petition. New facts. Appeal. Rested and focused. Determine his fate. The last meal. One more shot. Death row case. Die by legal injection. 
That's your line, Connor.

Associate with someone like that. He won't admit. Perjury testimony. Apparently Judge Millstone did nothing about it. Pressure to convict. Even motivated by race. Racist scheme. White people. Rich parents. My father wrote the book and Judge conduct. He's a highly respected federal judge. He'd never get to what he's got by burying evidence. Believe me. My dad wouldn't do this. Looks like we have a new target. Wouldn't be the first person to be disappointed by their father. 
Asher's parents house. Investigating the father. Respectable father. If you look at favourable lens  from your friend's father you'll never find anything. Clinical objectivity. Disappointment. Mixing clients. 
As a kid I used to look through all your journals. Years of meeting meticulously documented. It's impressive. There's only one day unaccounted for. One day in years. The day you met with the prosecutor on the David Allen's case.  Did the Ada on that case tell you that someone had committed perjury. One summer after that verdict you received your federal appointment. You were an underdog for the job. Mama's always said you friend Arthur Truco put the good word for you. Is this woman, Keating, putting these crazy ideas in your head? Your whole life you have prided yourself on the fact that you don't lie. And now I'm sitting here accusing you of grave judicial misconduct and your answer is where did i get the idea from? Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me you didn't get to be where you are on the back of a man who's gonna die. 
Get out. After all I've done for you. You ungrateful little twat. Get the hell out of my house. 
Concession to my two estipulation. My father's name stays out of it. I want the trophy. 
We still don't know who falsely testified. But we do know it was to satisfy this man. Arthur Truco is a state senator who for reasons we need to find out needed so bad someone to go down on this murder that he convinced them to lie on the stand. Trucos' taxes. He owed a bunch properties in Fairmount. He was trying to raise the rent to get people to move out. Poor people, mostly. Poor black people. White folks could afford the higher rents. Trish was leading the charge against the development, but she had no power. The key eye witness lives in a building owned by senator truco. So it's the teacher. It's the one you least suspect. 
The stand:
The hero. The discourse. Create emotion. Why were you being evicted? For failure to make rent. And yet fur days after you testified the suit was dropped. You never payed the debts you owed, is that because your testimony was your payment? Did anyone associated with senator truco tell you that your rent problems would go away if you testified that you saw David Allen carrying a gun that day. My client is set to die based on a perjury testimony. Perjury testimony bought by senator truco. Would the court like to be put on record for refusing to hear his testimony while Senator Truco is sitting in his office across the street. 
Senator Truco, in 1993 you developed the land at Penn's landing into what is now Truco plaza. Million people who traffic through the plaza. My constituents expect me to make the most of my time. I have a record of an injunction brought against your project by Trisha Stanley, advocating for the thousands of citizens living in low income housing who would be displaced by your project. 10 days later miss Stanley was murdered, your attorney struck down the injunction and your project went forward unopposed. So my question is Did you have Trisha Stanley murdered? 
Did you convice your tenant Linda morelli to testify that Trisha Stanley was killed by her boyfriend, David Allen? 
Explain why your eviction suit against miss morelli was dropped despite her inability to pay rent. 
Is it because her lost rent money was nothing compared to the millions you made once miss Stanley was out of your way? Answer the question, Senator. Why was Linda morelli grated theses concessions? 
I am sorry, senator, if you do not have the time to answer for who bought the real cost of your development. Not just Trisha Stanley and her boyfriend, David Allen, who served 21 years in prison but the thousands who were displaced in the name of lining your pockets. The majority of whom are poor, powerless and didn't hear the color of skin desirable to your business interests. You tore a community apart. You tore families apart. You destroyed lives, Senator. Admit it. Admit you killed Trisha Stanley and had my client, David Allen, set up for her murder. 
Advice: corporate law. 
Bad advice. White whore. 
You haven't responded. Everyone's worried about you. If you're sick or something. Miss the opportunity to work on it. You can take that back. I don't want it. What do you want? You're in love. It's about doing the right thing. And you think that protecting the drug dealer next door. Blind faith in someone you barely even know. Don't tell it's because you think she's innocent. Get her back. 
I think it was the other way around. Let's call it mutual. Let's call it never happening again, how about that? You forgot your coffee. Right. Find her. 
Oh totally. You want to come over. This is freaking whack a mole. Stop leading Frank on. It's not Frank a rich girl like you ends up with. 
Must be hot. Sleeping with a murderer. Evasive, interesting. And the guy with the corrupt dad doesn't get to say crap about me. 
Paranoid Connor is the best Connor. Your dad sent a guy to death row for no reason. How does the feel? Knowing that your charmed existence came at the expense of another man's life? I'm sure it's not the first instance the Kennebunkport Millstone have profited off other people's misfortunes. 
Fabricating proof. A motive for murdering. Whatever it takes. Isn't that what you said. Let's keep it professional. You're not into me. You don't have to say twice. She's taking care of it. I don't think you should go to jail for something you didn't do. Annelise protecting Sam. After everything you've done to me. Lying, screwing that girl. After everything I need you. I need you. And I love. 
You think it could never happened one more time. Don't lie to me right now. Are you with him? Sam. Something terrible's happened. 
Episode 7 
In love with the drug dealer girl. Coke, mole, pot. Metanfetamina.

I need more time. Alternative theories. The surprise of the unknown. A sealed file. Discredit DA's conviction. Expert witness. It's legal to pay for testimony expert. If you pay enough cash you can get them to say about anything. How do you combat this corruption? Question the work and ethics. Banned as an expert witness because of your negligible work. Find your own expert. Parents agains exumation. Get evicted. Public defends office. Don't pratonize me. The most private person ever. Community college. Change or whatever it is I'm tryna do. Prenup.

Some guys only get hooked up for crazy. You have some sort of voodoo penis. How about I make you remember. This couldn't get any more embarrassing. Reveal the new findings. Thank you for meeting me. It's not helping me. It's helping my client. Drunk Connor. And he/she she hates me. He's supposed to be getting information instead he's talking about his boyfriend. 
Hey something is wrong with my phone. Your number is not in it. Drunk Asher. Plea deal. 
Collusion. Maybe there's another way. Tell me again about the story. We'll cooperate fully. Language. Language. The silent treatment. Fixing someone's else problems. Confrontation and sex. We're not screwing. Sex, dead body, autopsy. There's nothing else between us. I think about you all the time. It's freaking annoying. What if I don't want you to get over it. She was pregnant. I'm done lying to you. 
I don't care who has the trophy, Ms. Pratt... You, Mr. Millstone. It really doesn't matter. Of course it matters. You built our entire semester on it.
Episode 9
I'm done saving your ass. 
I'm done believing you.
I'm done loving you. 
Get out of this house. 
There you are. 
You finally said it. 
After all these years, you're finally able to tell the truth. 
You lie so much. Your words mean nothing to me. You mean nothing to me. 
The black woman in your arms so you can hide. Maybe it took me 20 years to see it, but I see it now. 
People would see you for the pathetic man you are. 
Episode 10
How do we know she's not setting us up. 
The rest of us will pin all of it in the one. 
The paranoia. 
Let me tell them. 
I'm protecting myself. 
Look what happened when I tell her one of our secrets. Be strong and help the others. 
Lies and flashbacks. 
Why aren't you freaking out right now? No, you're fine. We're all gonna be ok. 
We have to prove that my husband killed Lila. 
No one's this relieved when they find out their husband knocked some girl up. 
You had fun. I was drunk and desperate. 
Abortion. 
Phone data. GPS. Location. Storage. Backup. Laptop. 
You call it crazy. I call it winning. 
Reverse psychology. Rat them out. PTSD.

To allow this trial to proceed would be a gross miscarriage of justice. 
She's not a person like the rest of us are people. 
The clerk tale. 
Episode 11
People don't make sense. 
He's not the man we thought. 
My husband is holding two girls captive in our basement. Plead deal. Voice recorder. 
I am dating two guys at once.  
You've hurt my feelings. I know I should be used to it by now cause everyone makes fun of me but you didn't. And then you were mean to me for no reason. I'll stop being a jerk. Group therapy. Talk. 
Secretly hate us. Trauma. 
You want the truth. Go ahead and ask me. 
The first time you had her. You would know, wouldn't you? That she was a virgin. 
Joined bank account in Mykonos. 
S02
Episode 01
Wes Vs Annalise in class.
Use this as an opportunity to exercise your brain. 
Pass. I don't know the answer. That what pass means. So either you keep wasting everyone's time or move on. Your choice. 
Who does this? Barely speak to someone in years, almost avoid, and then out of the blue. 
I gave you the chance to explain it. You just lied to my face. I'm not doing this. I'm not letting you ruin me. And risk my entire career in the process? Did you really think I would do that? That I wouldn't remember how familiar this all feels? You don't get to do this anymore. You can't use people and expect them to stick around. Maybe this is all who you've always been and I was just blind to it. All the ambition to just make up for the fact that you knew deep inside that there's nothing good inside of you. Shame on me for expecting more. 
This Laurel. She's always sticking her head where it don't belong. Asking questions that don't concern her. She lied to me about the trophy that night, stole prom queen's ring and even suggested that I killed Rebecca.

Paixão de faculdade. 
Consider the facts. What if I did do it? Kill my husband. Like I said. I'm not on trial. To having some fun. You can't keep beating yourself. It's time to move on. 
Why did you have to do that? 
You needed to pin it on me. I knew that. 
But it didn't have to make it about me. Me. 
The things you knew would hurt me. 
You made it personal and I don't understand why you had to do that. Unless that was the point. To hurt me. Why would you do that? 
Because part of me is still in love with you. 
It's pathetic. 
I hate how you make me feel. Cause I can't have you. 
It was real with you. 
And I got scared. So I left. But you're the most beautiful thing that ever happened to me. 
E02
I didn't take care of you. I ruined you.

They're not just cheap hand-me-downs that you put in the poor box at church. You're too proud for hand-me-downs from the poor box. Everyone is too good for hand-me-downs in the poor box, mama. Oh, you want to sing that song again? Forget it. Our house burned down to the ground, and we were left with nothing. And still your face was clean, your belly was fed, and your butt was covered. I took care of you. I protected you. Did you? What did you say? Nothing. Don't sass me, Anna Mae. Annalise. Anna Mae is a beautiful name. Mama, how many times have I asked you to call me... This is the first time... No, this is not the first time! First time in person. I never been invited up in here, have I? To Annalise Keating's fancy-ass rich house. You get rich, you give yourself a rich name... Annalise. Your name is Anna Mae. Something else your mama gave you from the poor box. I'm not saying that the name wasn't good enough. I'm telling you that I changed it, and I'm just asking you to respect the fact that I changed it and to honor my request... What the hell are you talking about? "Respect the fact" and "honor your request"? Who the hell do you think you are... Oprah? I wiped your ass, and I'll call you anything I want. [Sighs] You know what, mama? You go ahead and you take Sam's things, okay? Just take them all. Anna Mae.
Somebody's always the student, somebody's always the teacher. That's how s*x works best.
High and mighty in this fancy, rich house that I never got to...
No, no, mama. All right?
Let's not go around and around like this.
Let's just dive right in.
Did you know?

Did you know what he did to me?!

You ain't learned nothing.
I bought that house over off peachtree when I was pregnant with you.
I was so proud of that house.
It wasn't much, but it was mine.
Built a porch swing and tended a little garden that was just right out front.
[Chuckling] I baked up a storm on that old stove.
You know the ones that you had to light with a long match?
[Chuckles]
And one winter [Sniffs] Uncle Clyde came by and said he needed a place to stay, just till he got on his feet, he said.
Can't turn your back on your family.
And then, one day I woke up in the middle of the night.
I don't know what it was.
I-I-I just woke up.
I walked down the hall to look in on you, and Clyde, he came out of your room, and I knew what he had done.
He was a big man.
Loved his liquor and his hooch.
Smoked three packs of cigarettes a day, was always stinking up the house with cigarette smoke.
All the time, he would just fall asleep on the couch, a cigarette hanging out his mouth.
I'd go by and put it out.
Then one night, not too long after, he fell asleep on the couch drunk as a skunk, that cigarette hanging out of his mouth.
I got you and your brothers and sisters out of bed, and we went over to aunt mabel's to sleep.
And that night, that house that I loved so much burned to the ground, and your Uncle Clyde burned right with it.
Oh, I know how... how you've been torturing yourself about what went on here, baby.
And maybe you did something real bad...
I don't know and don't much care if you did.
I know if you did, you had your reason.
'Cause sometimes you got to do what you got to do...
Even if all you've got is a long match and a very flammable hooch.

The evil father dialectics in How to get away with murder 
List all evil male figures in the series: Sam/Frank, Wes, Khaleb/Philip, Asher's father, Wes' father and grandfather, Laurel's father
The exhausting role of the hero: trying to save everyone from evil figures
Lacanian analysis 
The Evil Father Dialectics in How to Get Away with Murder
In How to Get Away with Murder, male figures often embody oppressive and destructive patriarchal archetypes, positioning themselves as "evil fathers" in the lives of the central characters. These figures enforce control, perpetuate cycles of violence, and represent obstacles to individual autonomy. They create a web of trauma and manipulation that the protagonists, particularly Annalise Keating, struggle to dismantle. Below is an analysis of the series' male figures and their role within Lacanian psychoanalysis.
---
List of Evil Male Figures
1. Sam Keating
Annalise's manipulative husband, whose infidelity and deceit unravel the moral compass of the group.
Represents the symbolic father whose authority needs to be dismantled.
2. Frank Delfino
A morally ambiguous figure whose actions often harm others under the guise of loyalty to Annalise.
Reflects the dual role of victim and perpetrator, caught in cycles of obedience to paternalistic figures.
3. Wes Gibbins' Family
Wes' Father and Grandfather: Both embody systemic neglect and a disconnection from familial duty.
Their absence and betrayal mirror the symbolic father's failure to protect and nurture.
4. Khaleb and Philip Jessup
Figures of violence who represent internalized familial corruption and inherited trauma.
5. Asher’s Father (Judge Millstone)
A powerful judge who imposes his rigid values on Asher, perpetuating cycles of privilege and guilt.
6. Laurel Castillo’s Father (Jorge Castillo)
A quintessential patriarch who uses power and wealth to control his daughter and manipulate her relationships.
---
The Exhausting Role of the Hero
Annalise Keating is burdened with the exhausting responsibility of being the hero. She takes on the Sisyphean task of protecting her students from the destruction caused by these male figures, often at great personal cost. This savior complex reflects:
A desire to undo past wrongs: Annalise projects her guilt and trauma onto her students, believing she must shield them to atone for her failures.
The impossible task of protecting everyone: Her role mirrors the Lacanian "impossible" demand of the Other, where she is trapped in a cycle of seeking approval and mastery over chaos.
---
Lacanian Analysis Based on the Klein Bottle
1. The Evil Father as the Lack
These male figures embody the Name-of-the-Father (Nom-du-Père), which in Lacanian theory is meant to symbolize authority and the law. However, in HTGAWM, they fail to fulfill this stabilizing role, creating a void (a lack) that destabilizes the Symbolic order.
This lack permeates the characters' unconscious, driving them to engage in destructive patterns.
2. The Klein Bottle and the Hero's Exhaustion
The Klein Bottle represents the infinite folding of inside and outside, illustrating Annalise's attempts to navigate her inner trauma while facing external crises.
Her desire to "save" others is a futile attempt to reconcile this continuous loop, as she cannot escape the internal void left by her own experiences with patriarchal violence.
3. The Perversion of Jouissance
The evil fathers extract jouissance (excess enjoyment) through their control and manipulation, feeding on the suffering of those around them.
Annalise's students, caught in this web, are positioned as objects within the patriarchal gaze, forced to play roles in the fathers' perverse fantasies.
4. The Fall of the Father and the Real
The eventual destruction of these male figures (e.g., Sam's murder, Jorge's downfall) does not resolve the characters' conflicts but instead exposes them to the Real—the trauma and loss that cannot be symbolized.
---
Conclusion
The interplay of these "evil father" figures and the exhausting hero role in HTGAWM illustrates the ongoing struggle to dismantle patriarchal authority. Lacanian analysis, through the lens of the Klein Bottle, reveals the cyclical nature of trauma and desire, where the absence of stabilizing paternal figures perpetuates chaos. Annalise's journey encapsulates the endless loop of attempting to restore order while navigating the fragmented landscape of the unconscious.

Annalise Keating faces trial, accused of multiple murders, including that of her husband, Sam Keating. In a powerful closing argument, she delivers a candid speech acknowledging her flaws but denying the murders. The jury ultimately finds her not guilty on all counts. 
Key Character Outcomes
Frank Delfino and Bonnie Winterbottom: Frank discovers his true parentage, learning he is the son of Sam Keating and his sister, Hannah. Overwhelmed by this revelation, he seeks vengeance against Governor Birkhead, whom he holds responsible for the conspiracies against Annalise. During a chaotic confrontation on the courthouse steps, Frank fatally shoots the Governor but is killed in the ensuing gunfire. Bonnie, attempting to intervene, is accidentally shot by Frank and dies in Annalise's arms. 
Nate Lahey: Nate testifies in Annalise's defense, revealing the coercive tactics used by the FBI. He later decides to leave the tumultuous environment, using a substantial financial settlement to open a rehabilitation center in honor of his late father. 
Connor Walsh and Oliver Hampton: Connor is sentenced to prison for his involvement in past crimes but chooses to serve his time, seeking redemption. Oliver offers to wait for him, but Connor insists that Oliver move on with his life. 
Michaela Pratt: Michaela secures a deal granting her immunity, avoiding prison time. However, her ambition and decisions lead to estrangement from her friends, leaving her isolated. 
Laurel Castillo: Laurel, who had been in hiding, returns to testify, aiming to protect herself and her son, Christopher. She ultimately distances herself from the group's criminal past to ensure a safer future for her child. 
Flash-Forward Sequence
The series concludes with a flash-forward, revealing an older Annalise attending her own funeral. This symbolic scene suggests she lived a long life, possibly free from the burdens of her past. Additionally, Christopher, the son of Laurel and Wes, is shown as an adult, following in Annalise's footsteps by becoming a law professor, teaching a course titled "How to Get Away with Murder," indicating the cyclical nature of the narrative. 
This finale encapsulates the series' central themes of justice, redemption, and the complex moral landscapes navigated by its characters.
For a more in-depth analysis and review of the series finale, you might find the following video insightful:
In How to Get Away with Murder, the FBI and Governor Birkhead became complicit in murder through their involvement in conspiracies, cover-ups, and the orchestration of violent actions against Annalise Keating and her associates. Here's how their actions unfolded:
---
1. Governor Birkhead
Governor Birkhead, as one of the series' primary antagonists, was directly responsible for several crimes:
Conspiracy Against Annalise: Birkhead orchestrated a campaign to frame Annalise for multiple murders, including her husband Sam Keating’s death, as part of a broader effort to dismantle Annalise's legal career and suppress her activism.
Murder of Nate Lahey Sr.: The governor played a critical role in the murder of Nate's father, Nate Sr., who was killed in prison under suspicious circumstances. This act was framed as a procedural error but was actually a targeted assassination to silence Nate Sr., who was part of Annalise’s high-profile legal cases.
Frank's Death: Though not directly responsible for pulling the trigger, the environment of violence and chaos created by Birkhead led to the deadly courthouse shooting in which Frank killed the Governor before being fatally shot himself.
---
2. The FBI
Certain FBI agents were complicit in unethical and criminal behavior:
Coercion and Manipulation: The FBI coerced Connor, Michaela, and Oliver into testifying against Annalise, leveraging plea deals and threats to manipulate them into false statements.
Cover-Up of Murders: FBI agents helped cover up or misrepresent deaths, such as Nate Sr.’s murder, to shield higher powers like Governor Birkhead from accountability.
Use of Informants: The FBI frequently used Laurel and others as informants, putting them in dangerous positions and indirectly contributing to violent outcomes.
---
How They Became "Murderers"
While the Governor and the FBI may not have directly killed most victims, their systemic abuse of power, coercion, and orchestration of violent plots make them culpable for these deaths. They weaponized the legal system and law enforcement, turning them into tools for murder and corruption.
This systemic violence reflects the series’ critique of institutional power and its ability to destroy lives while shielding those at the top from accountability.
Análise da História de Annalise Keating pela Teoria de Jacques Lacan
Annalise Keating, a personagem central de How to Get Away with Murder, é uma figura complexa e marcada por traumas profundos. Utilizando conceitos lacanianos, podemos compreender sua trajetória como uma luta contínua entre os registros do Real, do Simbólico e do Imaginário, e sua relação com o desejo, o gozo e a falta.
---
1. O Real: Trauma e Gozo
O registro do Real em Lacan se refere ao que é irrepresentável, aquilo que escapa à simbolização. Annalise é profundamente afetada por eventos traumáticos que operam no nível do Real:
Estupro: A violência sexual sofrida por Sam Keating simboliza uma intrusão brutal do Real em sua vida, deixando marcas psíquicas irreparáveis.
Perda do bebê: O acidente que mata seu filho gera uma impossibilidade de simbolização, um vazio que Annalise tenta preencher ao proteger seus estudantes.
Relação com a mãe: Sua mãe é uma figura ambivalente, ao mesmo tempo fonte de cuidado e representante do trauma geracional (incluindo abuso sexual na família).
Esses traumas fazem de Annalise uma figura que busca compulsivamente escapar ou confrontar o Real, seja pelo trabalho, pelo álcool ou pelas relações intensas.
---
2. O Simbólico: Nome-do-Pai e a Lei
O Simbólico, onde o Nome-do-Pai opera, é central para compreender a posição de Annalise na sociedade e em suas relações:
Ausência do Nome-do-Pai: Annalise cresceu em um contexto de carência simbólica, sem figuras masculinas protetoras. Essa falta contribui para sua dificuldade em confiar em figuras de autoridade (juízes, advogados, maridos).
Subversão da Lei: Como advogada e professora, Annalise constantemente manipula o Simbólico, dobrando a lei para proteger a si mesma e seus protegidos. Essa subversão revela tanto sua habilidade quanto sua impossibilidade de se inscrever completamente no sistema simbólico da justiça.
Reconhecimento do Outro: Sua luta para provar sua inocência e seu valor reflete sua busca por reconhecimento simbólico, tanto pelo sistema jurídico quanto pelos que ama.
---
3. O Imaginário: Máscaras e Identidade
No registro do Imaginário, Annalise está constantemente lidando com imagens idealizadas e fragmentadas de si mesma:
A máscara profissional: Annalise constrói uma persona de mulher poderosa e invulnerável, mas essa imagem frequentemente colapsa diante de seus traumas e inseguranças.
Relações amorosas: Suas relações com Sam, Nate e Eve mostram como ela projeta e busca imagens do amor, tentando preencher sua falta, mas nunca alcançando completude.
O espelho do desejo: Os estudantes de Annalise funcionam como espelhos que refletem suas próprias falhas e potencialidades, tornando suas interações com eles profundamente ambíguas.
---
4. O Desejo e a Falta
O desejo de Annalise é marcado pela tentativa de lidar com a falta fundamental:
Desejo de reparação: Sua necessidade de proteger os estudantes (os “Keating Five”) é uma tentativa de reparar as perdas irreparáveis de sua vida.
Desejo de justiça e controle: Annalise busca desesperadamente controlar seu entorno, tentando organizar o caos de sua vida e superar o sentimento de impotência.
Desejo de reconhecimento: No fundo, Annalise deseja ser reconhecida como alguém digna de amor, respeito e redenção.
---
5. O Gozo: Excesso e Autodestruição
Annalise é uma personagem que frequentemente ultrapassa os limites do desejo, entrando no território do gozo:
Gozo autodestrutivo: Seu alcoolismo e tendências autodestrutivas refletem uma tentativa de lidar com a pressão insuportável de seus traumas.
Gozo do Outro: Suas relações amorosas são marcadas por uma entrega excessiva, onde ela busca algo que o Outro não pode oferecer.
Excesso de responsabilidade: Annalise assume o peso do mundo nas costas, tentando salvar todos ao seu redor, o que resulta em uma vida de exaustão e sacrifício.
---
6. O Klein Bottle e a Estrutura de Annalise
Utilizando o modelo do Klein Bottle (garrafa de Klein), podemos ver Annalise como alguém que tenta incessantemente unir o interior e o exterior:
Ela tenta reparar os buracos de sua história ao conectar o dentro (seus traumas, dores e desejos) com o fora (seu trabalho, seus relacionamentos, o sistema jurídico).
No entanto, a garrafa de Klein ilustra a impossibilidade de fechar completamente essa lacuna, deixando Annalise presa em um ciclo interminável de tentativa e falha.
---
Conclusão
Annalise Keating é uma figura trágica que exemplifica muitos conceitos lacanianos, desde o desejo e o gozo até a falta e a impossibilidade de completude. Sua luta constante entre os registros do Real, Simbólico e Imaginário demonstra a complexidade da psique humana e a impossibilidade de escapar completamente das marcas do trauma. Annalise não é apenas uma heroína; ela é um exemplo vivo da condição humana, cheia de contradições, lutas e resiliência.
Como esses temas podem ser interpretados em termos de ansiedade no sexo
Ansiedade no sexo em termos dos conceitos lacanianos aplicados a Annalise Keating
A trajetória de Annalise Keating permite abordar a ansiedade sexual a partir da intersecção entre o Real, o Simbólico e o Imaginário. Essa análise reflete como os traumas, a falta e o gozo se manifestam nas experiências sexuais e nos relacionamentos íntimos, e como esses elementos podem gerar ansiedade.
---
1. O Real: O corpo e o trauma sexual
O corpo como lugar de trauma: Para Annalise, o corpo é marcado pelo Real do trauma, especialmente pelo estupro que sofreu. Essa intrusão traumática dificulta sua relação com o próprio corpo e com a sexualidade, gerando uma desconexão ou hiperconsciência corporal.
Ansiedade como retorno do Real: No ato sexual, o Real pode retornar de forma avassaladora, manifestando-se como medo ou desconforto. A intimidade torna-se um terreno perigoso onde o trauma pode ser revivido.
---
2. O Simbólico: O papel da Lei e do desejo do Outro
O Nome-do-Pai e a lei do desejo: A ansiedade sexual em Annalise pode ser interpretada como resultado da falha simbólica em estabelecer uma lei estável no campo do desejo. A ausência de figuras paternas protetoras na infância e a traição de figuras masculinas ao longo da vida (Sam, Nate) fragilizam sua segurança simbólica.
Desejo e falta: O desejo em Lacan é sempre estruturado pela falta. Annalise busca no sexo e nos relacionamentos preencher essa falta, mas nunca encontra a completude, o que gera uma sensação de inadequação ou insuficiência no encontro sexual.
---
3. O Imaginário: A performance e a imagem no sexo
A máscara da perfeição: Annalise frequentemente desempenha uma imagem de poder e controle, mesmo em suas relações íntimas. Essa performance pode gerar ansiedade sexual, pois ela teme que, ao baixar a guarda, o parceiro veja suas vulnerabilidades.
Fragmentação da imagem: No espelho do Outro, Annalise vê refletidas suas falhas e traumas, o que pode desestabilizar sua autoconfiança e gerar sentimentos de inadequação sexual.
---
4. O gozo e a ansiedade do excesso
O gozo como excesso: Lacan diferencia o gozo do prazer. No caso de Annalise, há um movimento em direção ao gozo, que é excessivo e muitas vezes autodestrutivo. No sexo, isso pode se manifestar como uma busca incessante por algo que nunca é suficiente, gerando ansiedade e frustração.
Medo do gozo do Outro: Annalise também pode experimentar ansiedade em relação ao gozo do parceiro, temendo não ser capaz de satisfazê-lo ou sendo invadida pela demanda do Outro.
---
5. A ansiedade como falha no elo entre os registros
A Garrafa de Klein: A sexualidade de Annalise pode ser vista como uma tentativa de unir o interior (seus traumas e desejos inconscientes) com o exterior (as expectativas do Outro). A falha inevitável em fechar essa lacuna resulta em ansiedade sexual, pois ela nunca consegue alcançar a harmonia desejada.
---
Exemplos de manifestações da ansiedade sexual em Annalise
Episódios com Eve Rothlo: Sua relação com Eve revela tanto desejo quanto medo de intimidade. A ansiedade surge na tensão entre seu desejo por segurança e seu medo de vulnerabilidade.
Casamento com Sam Keating: A traição de Sam aprofunda sua desconfiança, tornando os relacionamentos futuros ainda mais carregados de ansiedade.
Relacionamento com Nate: Sua relação com Nate é marcada pela tentativa de manter o controle, o que reflete sua dificuldade em se entregar plenamente sem medo de ser machucada.
---
Conclusão: Ansiedade sexual como expressão da falta
Para Annalise, a ansiedade no sexo é uma manifestação da falta estruturante do sujeito. A sexualidade se torna um campo de disputa entre o desejo, o gozo e o trauma, onde ela busca incessantemente algo que nunca pode ser plenamente alcançado. Essa ansiedade não é apenas individual, mas também relacional, refletindo a dificuldade de equilibrar as demandas internas e externas do desejo.
# Doubt
Sister Aloysius ultimately confesses, “I have doubts.”
But in a Lacanian sense, her act—forcing Father Flynn out—is still an ethical one. She acts without proof, because she senses something in the gap of the Symbolic, a residue that cannot be named but must be responded to.
Mr. Hurley?
Leave me alone!
Who do you think you're talking to?
This is my classroom, boy!
Don't you forget that.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
- Viola Davis
Have you met
Father Flynn?
Just seen him on the altar.
Haven't met him face to face.
No, just, you know, heard from Donald.
And what does he say?
You know, "Father
Flynn, Father Flynn."
He looks up to him. Man gives him his time, which is what the boy needs.
He needs that.
Mrs. Miller, we may have a problem.
I thought there must a been a reason you wanting to see me.
Principal's a big job.
I just want to say though, it's just till June.
Excuse me?
Whatever the problem is, Donald just has to make it till June.
Then he's off into high school.
Right.
If Donald can graduate from St. Nicholas, he has a better chance of getting into a good high school, and that would mean an opportunity at college.
I don't see anything at this time standing in the way of his graduating with his class.
Well, that's all I care about.
I doubt that.
Try me.
I am concerned about the relationship between Father Flynn and your son.
You don't say. Concerned.
What do you mean, concerned?
That it may not be right.
Well, there's something wrong with everybody, and their soul gotta be forgiven.
I work right there.
I am concerned, to be frank, that Father Flynn may have made advances on your son.
May have made?
I can't be certain.
No evidence?
No.
Then maybe there's nothing to it.
I think there is something to it.
I think Father Flynn gave
Donald that altar wine.
Why would he do that?
Has Donald been acting strangely?
No.
Nothing out of the ordinary?
He's been himself.
All right.
Look, Sister, I don't want any trouble.
I don't... I'm not sure you completely understand.
I think I understand the kind of thing you're talking about, but I don't want to get into it.
What's that?
Look, I only have a few minutes.
Not to be disagreeing, but if we're talking about something floating around between this priest and my son, it ain't my son's fault.
I'm not suggesting that...
He's just a boy.
I know.
Twelve years old.
If someone should be taking blame, it should be the man...
I know. I agree with you completely. not the boy.
You're agreeing with me, but I got called to the principal, if you know what I'm saying.
I am concerned about
Donald's welfare.
You honestly think that priest gave Donald that wine to drink?
Yes, I do.
Then how come my son got kicked off the altar boys if it was a man that gave it to him?
I know.
The boy got caught, the man didn't.
So you're giving my son the blame.
No.
No problem my son getting blamed, and you know why that is.
Perhaps you should let me talk.
I think you're getting upset.
Sister, you ain't going against no man in a robe and win.
He's got the position.
And he's got your son.
Let him have him then.
What?
It's just till June.
Do you know what you're saying?
Know more about it than you.
I believe this man is creating, or may have already brought about, an improper relationship with your son.
I don't know.
I know I am right.
Why you gotta know something like that for sure when you don't?
What kind of mother are you?
Excuse me, but you don't know enough about life to say a thing like that, Sister.
I know enough.
You know the rules maybe, but that don't cover it.
I know what I won't accept.
You accept what you gotta accept, and you work with it.
This man is in my school.
Well, he's gotta be somewhere and maybe he's doing some good, too.
He is after the boys!
Well, maybe some of them boys want to get caught!
That's why his father beat him.
Not the wine.
What are you telling me?
I'm talking about the boy's nature now, not anything he's done.
You can't hold a child responsible for what God gave him to be.
I'm only interested in actions, Mrs. Miller.
But then there's the boy's nature.
Leave that out of it.
Well, forget it then.
You're the one forcing people to say things.
My boy came to your school
'cause they were gonna kill him in the public school.
His father don't like him.
He come to your school, kids don't like him.
One man is good to him, this priest.
Then does a man have his reasons, yes.
Everybody does.
You have your reasons, but do I ask the man why he's good to my son?
No.
I don't care why.
My son needs some man to care about him and to see him through to where he wants to go.
And thank God this educated man with some kindness in him wants to do just that.
This will not do.
It's just till June.
I'll throw your son out of this school.
And why would you do that if it didn't start with him?
Because I will stop this.
You'd hurt my son to get your way?
It won't end with your son.
Throw the priest out then.
I am trying to do just that.
Then what do you want from me?
Nothing.
As it turns out.
Please leave my son out of this.
My husband will kill that child over a thing like this.
I will try.
I'm late.
Sister,
I don't know if you and me on the same side.
I'll be standing with my son and those who are good with my son.
It'd be nice to see you there.
- I will not let this go
Good morning.
May I come in?
A third party would be required.
Yeah. What was Donald's mother doing here?
We were having a chat.
About what?
A third party would truly be required, Father.
No, Sister.
No third party!
Me and you are due for a talk!
You have to stop this campaign against me.
You can stop it at any time.
How?
Confess and resign.
You are attempting to destroy my reputation!
Who keeps opening my window?
What are you doing in this school?
I'm trying to do good.
Even more to the point, what are you doing in the priesthood?
You are single-handedly holding this school and this parish back.
From what?
Progressive education and a welcoming church.
You can't distract me, Father.
This is not about my behavior, it's about yours.
No, this is about your unfounded suspicions.
That's right.
I have suspicions.
Just leave that.
It's not important.
I will decide what's important.
Why do you suspect me?
What have I done?
You gave that boy wine, and you let him take the blame.
That's completely untrue.
Did you talk to Mr. McGuinn?
All McGuinn knows is that the boy drank wine.
He doesn't know how he came to drink it.
Did his mother have something to add to that?
No.
So that's it.
I am not satisfied.
Ask the boy then.
He'd protect you.
Why would he do that?
Because you have seduced him.
You're insane.
You've got it in your head that I corrupted this child after giving him wine, and nothing I say will change that.
That's right.
But this has nothing to do with the wine.
Not really. You've had a fundamental mistrust of me before this incident.
It was you that warned Sister James to be on the lookout, wasn't it?
That's true.
So you admit it!
Certainly.
Why?
I know people.
That's not good enough.
It won't have to be.
How's that?
You will tell me what you have done.
Oh, I will.
Out again.
Sister James is convinced
I'm innocent.
So you talked to Sister James.
Well, of course you talked to Sister James.
Did you know Donald's father beats him?
Yes.
And might that not account for the odd behavior
Sister James noticed in the boy?
It might.
Then what is it? What?
What did you hear?
What did you see that convinced you so thoroughly?
What does it matter?
It matters! What does it matter?
I want to know!
Out this window,
I saw you grab
William London's wrist, and I saw him pull away.
Are you serious?
I am.
That's all?
Yeah. That was all.
That's nothing.
What are you doing now?
I'm writing down what you say.
It might be important when I have to explain why you have to be removed.
This morning before I spoke with Mrs. Miller,
I took the precaution of calling your last parish.
What did he say?
Who?
The pastor.
I did not speak to the pastor.
I spoke to a nun.
You should have spoken to the pastor.
I spoke to a nun.
You know that's not the proper route for you to have taken, Sister.
The church is very clear.
You're supposed to go through the pastor.
Why? You have an understanding, you and he?
No, you have no right to go rummaging through my past!
You have a history.
This is your third parish in five years.
Why?
Call the pastor.
Ask him why I left.
It's perfectly innocent.
I'm not calling the pastor.
I'm a good priest.
Go after another child and another child, until you are stopped.
What nun did you speak to?
I won't say.
Yeah, I've not touched a child.
You have!
You haven't the slightest proof of anything.
But I have my certainty.
And armed with that,
I'll go to your last parish and the one before that.
If necessary, I'll find a parent.
Trust me, Father Flynn, I will.
You have no right to act on your own!
You have taken vows, obedience being one!
You answer to us!
You have no right to step outside the church!
I will step outside the church if that's what needs to be done, though the door should shut behind me!
I will do what needs to be done, though I'm damned to hell!
You should understand that, or you will mistake me.
Now, did you give Donald
Miller wine to drink?
Have you never done anything wrong?
I have.
No mortal sin?
Yes.
And?
I confessed it, Father.
Then whatever I have done,
I have left in the healing hands of my confessor.
As have you.
We are the same.
Mmm-mmm.
No, we are not.
We are not the same.
A dog that bites is a dog that bites.
Did you give Donald
Miller wine to drink?
No.
Mental reservations?
No.
You lie.
Very well then.
If you will not leave my office, I will.
And once I go, I will not stop.
Wait.
I can't say everything, you understand?
There's things I can't say, even if you can't imagine the explanation, Sister.
Remember, there are things beyond your knowledge.
Even if you feel certainty, it is an emotion, not a fact.
You will request a transfer and take a leave of absence until it's granted.
You'd leave me nothing.
It's Donald Miller who has nothing, and you took full advantage of that.
I've done nothing wrong.
I care about that boy.
Why?
'Cause you smile at him?
And you sympathize with him?
And you talk to him as if you were the same?
You are a cheat.
And that warm feeling you experienced when that boy looked at you with trust was not the sensation of virtue.
That could be got by any drunkard with his tot of rum.
I can fight you.
You will lose.
Where's your compassion?
Nowhere you can get at it.
Stay here.
Compose yourself.
You can use the phone if you'd like.
Good day, Father.
I have no sympathy for you.
I know you are invulnerable to true regret.
And cut your nails.
- I have doubts
And Father Flynn is gone?
Yes.
So you did it.
You got him out.
Yes.
Donald Miller is heartbroken.
Can't be helped.
It's just till June.
I don't think Father Flynn did anything wrong.
No? He convinced you?
Yes, he did.
Mmm.
Did you ever prove it?
To whom?
Anyone but yourself?
Nope.
But you were sure?
Yes.
I wish I could be like you.
Why?
Because I can't sleep anymore.
Maybe we're not supposed to sleep so well.
They made Father Flynn pastor of Saint Jerome.
Who?
The bishop.
Appointed Father Flynn pastor of
Saint Jerome Church and School.
It's a promotion.
You didn't tell them?
Oh, I told our good monsignor.
I crossed the garden, and I told him.
He did not believe it to be true.
Then why did Father Flynn go?
What did you say to make him leave?
That I had called a nun in his previous parish, that I had found out his prior history of infringements.
So you did prove it?
I made no such call.
You lied?
Yes.
But if he'd had no such history, the lie wouldn't have worked.
His resignation was his confession.
He was what I thought he was.
And he's gone.
I can't believe you lied.
In the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God.
Of course, there is a price.
I see.
Oh.
Sister James.
What is it, Sister?
I have doubts.
I have such doubts.

- I'm going to make a cake
11/13/18, 09:58 - Talles: "Well, I'm gonna make a cake.
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna make a cake for daddy's birthday.
Mommy, can I help?
Can I help make the cake?
Of course, you can, sweety.
I'm not gonna do anything without you."
- Otherwise he won't know we love him?
Let's think.
You grease the pan, Mommy.
I know you grease the pan, sweet one.
Even Mommy knows that.
This is what we're going to do.
Flour... bowl... sifter.
Can I do it, Mommy?
Can you sift the flour?
Yes, you can sift the flour, baby, if that's what makes you happy.
Yeah.
Isn't it beautiful?
Don't you think it looks like snow?
Hmm?
Okay.
Now, the next thing...
The next thing I'm going to show you... uh, is... we measure out the cups.
Mommy, it isn't that difficult.
Now, I know.
I know it isn't difficult.
It's just that I...
I just want to do this for Daddy.
Because it's his birthday?
That's right.
We're baking the cake to show him that we love him.
Otherwise he won't know we love him?
That's right.
- Kitty
Hello? Laura?
Hi, Kitty.
Hi. Am I interrupting?
Oh, of course not. Come in.
Are you all right?
Why, sure.
Hi, Richie.
Sit down. I've got coffee on.
Um, would you like some?
Please.
Oh, look.
You made a cake.
I know.
Didn't work.
I thought it was going to work.
I thought it would work better than that.
Oh, Laura, I don't understand why you find it so difficult.
I don't know either.
Anyone can make a cake.
I know.
Everyone can. It's ridiculously easy.
Like, I bet you didn't even grease the pan.
I greased the pan.
All right.
You know, you have other virtues... and Dan loves you so much, he won't even notice.
Whatever you do, he's going to say it's wonderful.
Well, it's true.
Does Ray have a birthday?
Sure he does.
When is it?
September.
We go to the country club.
We always go to the country club.
We drink martinis and spend the day with 50 people.
Ray's got a lot of friends. He does.
You both have a lot of friends.
You're good at it.
How is Ray?
I haven't seen him in a while.
Ray's fine.
Mmm.
These guys are something, aren't they?
You can say that again.
They came home from the war.
They deserved it, didn't they?
After what they'd been through.
What... did they deserve?
I don't know. Us, I guess.
All this.
Oh.
You're reading a book.
Yeah.
What's this one about?
Oh, it's about... this woman who's incredibly...
Well, she's a hostess, and she's incredibly confident, and she's going to give a party, and maybe because she's confident, everyone thinks she's fine... but she isn't.
So.
Well.
Kitty, what is it? Is something wrong?
I, uh...
I have to go into the hospital for a couple of days.
Kitty.
Yeah. I have, um... some kind of... growth, in my uterus, and they're going to go in and take a look.
When?
This afternoon.
Well, I need you to feed the dog.
Of course.
Is that what you came here to ask?
What did the doctor say exactly?
Well, it's probably what the trouble's been.
About getting pregnant.
The thing is...
I mean, you know, I've been... really happy with Ray.
And now it turns out there was a reason.
There was a reason I couldn't conceive.
You're lucky, Laura.
I don't think you can call yourself a woman until you're a mother.
The joke is... all my life I could do everything.
I mean, I could do anything, really.
Except the one thing I wanted.
Yes.
That's all.
Well, at least now they'll be able to deal with it.
That's right.
That's what they're doing.
That's right.
Mm. I'm not worried.
What would be the point of worrying?
No, it's not in your hands.
But that's it.
It's in the hands of some physician I've never even met.
Some surgeon who probably drinks more martinis
-than Ray and...
-Oh, Kitty.
I'm mean, of course I'm worried about Ray.
Come here.
I'm doing fine.
Really.
I know. I know you are.
I'm more worried about Ray.
If anything, he's not good with this stuff.
Forget about him, hmm?
Just forget about Ray.
You're sweet.
You know the routine, right?
Half a can in the evening, and... check the water now and then, and Ray will feed him in the morning.
Kitty, you didn't mind?
What?
I didn't mind what?
Do you want me to drive you?
I think I'll feel better if I drive myself.
Kitty, it's going to be all right.
Of course it is.
- Mommy, I don't want to do this.
Hi, Mrs. Latch.
My boy's not very happy.
Mommy, I don't want to do this.
I have to go, honey.
Your mommy has things she has to do.
Come in, I got cookies.
Okay, baby?
You have to be brave now.
Don't worry now.
It's going to be fine.
Well...
Honey!
Come on. Come on, darling.
Mommy!
-Stop it.
-No!
Darling, stop it.
Mommy!
- Not to be disturbed
Is there anything else you need?
Yes, um...
No.
Not to be disturbed.
'Did it matter, then? '
She asked herself, walking toward Bon Street.
Did it matter that she must inevitably cease completely?
All this must go on without her.
Did she resent it?
Or did it not become consoling to believe that death ended absolutely?
It is possible to die.
It is possible... to die.
- I'll tell you how it all happened.
Oh, Dan.
One day, Richie, I'll tell you.
I'll tell you how it all happened.
Don't.
I want to.
I want to tell him the story.
What happened... when I was in the war.
At war, I found myself thinking about this girl that I had seen...
I had never met her... at high school, this... strange, fragile-looking girl named Laura McGrath.
Yeah.
And she was shy... and she was interesting.
And... well, your mother won't mind if
I tell you this, Richie.
She was the sort of girl that you see sitting mostly on her own.
And I'll tell you... sometimes, when I was in the South Pacific, the fact is that I used to think about this girl.
Dan.
I used to think about bringing her to a house, to a life.
Pretty much like this.
And it was the thought of the happiness... the thought of this woman, the thought of this life... that's what kept me going.
I had an idea of our happiness.
- Only I knew that she could disappear.
What are you doing?
I'm brushing my teeth.
Are you coming to bed?
Yeah, in a minute.
Come to bed, Laura Brown.
I ran into Ray.
He said Kitty had to go to the hospital.
I know.
Nothing serious. He said just a check-up.
I'm terrified.
Why?
Only I knew that she could disappear.
Maybe you could go see her in the morning, honey.
I was going to. I was going to stop by.
I've had a wonderful day, and I have you to thank.
Come to bed, honey.
I'm coming.
Are you coming?
Yes.
What?
I was hoping you were going to bed.
I am.
I am going to bed.
- It was death, I chose life
What, then?
All else is clear.
The outline of the story is planned, now one thing only.
Mrs. Dalloway's destiny must be resolved.
You're Laura Brown.
Yes, I'm Richard's mother.
Of course.
I'm Clarissa Vaughan.
Please come in.
My friend Sally is in the kitchen, and my daughter.
I'll take this.
We were having a party.
We were going to have a party.
I was lucky.
I got the last plane from Toronto.
So, that's the monster.
Hope I did the right thing.
I found your number in his phone book.
Yes, he had it.
We didn't speak often.
It's a terrible thing, Miss Vaughan... to outlive your whole family.
Richard's father died.
Yes, he-he died of cancer quite young.
And Richard's sister is dead.
Obviously, you... feel unworthy.
Gives you feelings of unworthiness.
You survive and they don't.
Have you read the poems?
Oh, yes. Oh...
I also read the novel.
You see, uh, people say the novel is difficult.
Uh... I know.
They say that.
I know.
He had me die in the novel.
I-I-I know why he did that.
It hurt, of course.
I can't pretend it didn't hurt, but I...
I know why he did it.
You left Richard when he was a child.
I left both my children.
I abandoned them.
They say it's the worst thing a mother can do.
You have a daughter.
Yes...
But I never met Julia's father.
You so wanted a child.
That's right.
You're a lucky woman.
There are times when you don't belong, and you think you're going to kill yourself.
Once, I went to a hotel.
Later that night, I made a plan.
The plan was I would leave my family when my second child was born... and that's what I did.
I got up one morning, made breakfast, went to the bus stop, got on a bus.
I'd left a note.
I got a job in a library in Canada.
It would... be wonderful to say you regretted it.
It would be easy.
But what does it mean?
What does it mean to regret... when you have no choice?
It's what you can bear.
There it is.
No one's going to forgive me.
It was death.
I chose life.
Time to take your coat off.
I thought you might like a cup of tea.
Oh my goodness.
Thank you, dear.
I feel like I'm stealing your room.
Um, we put the food away, so, if you're at all hungry in the night, just help yourself.
Oh, I will.
Where will you sleep?
Oh, the sofa.
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Good night, sweetheart.
## Richard
- I got the prize for my performance.
Clarissa, I can't take this.
Take what?
Having to be proud and brave in front of everybody.
Oh. Honey, it's not a performance.
Of course it is. I got the prize for my performance.
Well, that is nonsense.
I got the prize for having AIDS and going nuts and being brave about it.
I actually got the prize for having come through.
It's not true.
-For surviving, that's what
-It's not true.
I got the prize for.
Oh, you think they would have given it to me if I were healthy?
- Always Giving parties
11/13/18, 10:05 - Talles: "It's only a party.
Populated entirely with people who respect and admire you.
Ha, small party, is it?
Select party, is it?
Your friends.
I thought I lost all my friends.
I thought I drove my friends crazy.
Jesus. -Oh, Mrs. Dalloway... always giving parties... to cover the silence."
11/13/18, 10:08 - Talles: " I can't take this.
Take what?
To be proud and brave... in front of everybody.
Honey, it's not a performance.
Of course, it is! I got a prize for my performance.
That is nonsense.
I got the prize for having AIDS and going nuts... and being brave about it!
I actually got the prize for having come through! -It's not true.
For surviving! -It's not true!
That's what I won it for!"
- I wanted to write about it all.
11/13/18, 10:12 - Talles: "I can't go through all this.
Why do you say that?
I can't!
Why?
Because I wanted to be a writer, that's all.
And?
I wanted to write about it all.
Everything that happens in a moment.
The way the flowers look when you carry them in your arms.
This towel - how it smells, how it feels... its thread.
All our feelings - yours and mine.
The history of it.
Who we once were.
Everything in the world.
Everything mixed up.
Like it's all mixed up now.
And I failed.
I failed.
No matter what you start up with, it ends up being so much less."
Sheer fucking pride... and stupidity.
We want everything, don't we?
I suppose we do.
You kissed me on a beach.
Yeah.
Do you remember... how many years ago?
Of course.
What did you want then?
Come closer.
I'm right here.
Come closer, would you, please?
Take my hand.
- Who is this party for?
11/13/18, 10:16 - Talles: "Come closer. Would you please?
Take my hand.
Would you be angry...
Would I be angry if you didn't show up at the party?
Would you be angry if I died?
If you died?
Who is this party for?
What do you mean who is it for?
Why are you asking? What are you trying to say?
I am not trying to say anything.
I'm saying I think I'm only staying alive to satisfy you.
So that is it we do.
That is what people do - they stay alive for each other.
The doctors told you - you don't need to die.
They told you. You can live this for years.
Well, exactly!
I don't accept this.
I don't accept what you say.
Oh, and it is for you to decide, is it?
How long have you been doing that?
How many years... coming for the apartment...
What about your own life?
What about Sally?
Just wait till I die, and you'll have to think of yourself.
How are you going to like that?"
Richard... it would be great if you did come to the party, if you felt well enough to come.
Just to let you know, I am making the crab thing.
Not that I imagine it makes any difference to you.
Of course, it makes a difference.
I love the crab thing.
Clarissa?
Yes?
I'll be back at 3:30, and I'll help you get dressed.
Wonderful.
- I don't think I can make it to the party
Richard, it's me. I'm early.
What the hell is going on?
Richard!
What are you doing here?
You're early!
Wha-What is going on here?
What are you doing?
I-I had this wonderful idea.
I needed some light.
I needed to let in some light!
Richard, what are you doing?
I had this fantastic notion.
I took the Xanax and the Ritalin together.
It-it never occurred to me.
-Richard...
-Don't come near me!
It seemed to me I needed to let in some light.
What do you think?
I cleared away all the windows.
All right, Richard, do me one simple favour.
Come. Come sit.
I don't think I can make it to the party, Clarissa.
You don't have to go to the party.
You don't have to go to the ceremony.
You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.
You can do as you like.
But I still have to face the hours, don't I?
I mean, the hours after the party, and the hours after that...
You do have good days still.
You know you do.
Not really.
I mean, it's kind of you to say so, but it's...
I mean, not really true.
Are they here?
Who?
The voices.
Oh, the voices are always here.
And it's the voices that you're hearing now, isn't it?
No, no, no, no.
Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.
I've stayed alive for you, but now you have to let me go.
-Richard, I...
-No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
Tell me a story.
What about?
Tell me a story from your day.
I, um... I-I got up...
Yes?
...and I went out, and, uh,
I went to buy flowers,
Like Mrs. Dalloway, in the book, you know?
Yes.
And it was a beautiful morning.
Was it?
Yes, it was so beautiful.
It was so fresh.
Oh, fresh, was it?
Yes.
Like a... like a morning on the beach?
Yes.
Like that?
Yes.
Like that morning when you walked out of that old house, and you were, you were 18, and maybe I was 19.
Yes.
I was 19 years old, and I'd never seen anything so beautiful.
You... coming out of a glass door in the early morning, still sleepy.
Isn't it strange?
Most ordinary morning in anybody's life.
I'm afraid I can't make it to the party, Clarissa.
The party... doesn't matter.
You've been so good to me,
Mrs. Dalloway.
I love you.
I don't think two people could've been happier than we've been.
Oh, God, no!
## Clarissa
- If only I knew what it was
My friend Richard's won the Carruthers.
Well, that's just terrific... if I knew what it was.
It's a poetry prize for a life's work.
It's the most prestigious.
For a poet, it's the best you can do.
Oh, very good.
So, what would you like?
The lilies are perfect.
No. Too morbid.
Hydrangeas, I think.
And, um... oh, oh, let's just have buckets of roses.
And...
I think I'm going to take these with me.
Rodney?
Okay.
Thank you.
I actually tried to read Richard's novel.
You did?
Oh, I know. It's not easy.
I know.
It did take him ten years to write.
Maybe it just takes another ten to read.
It's you, isn't it?
What is?
In the novel, isn't it meant to be you?
Oh, I see.
Yeah.
Sort of.
I mean, in a way.
You know, Richard's a writer.
That's what he is.
He uses things which actually happen.
Yeah.
And years ago, he and I were... students. That's true.
But, you know, then he changes things.
Oh, sure.
I don't mean in a bad way.
It's more like... he makes them his own.
- A woman's whole life...
A woman's whole life... in a single day, just one day... and in that day, her whole life.
It's on this day, this day of all days... her fate becomes clear to her.
- To dare go visit 
How's San Francisco?
Oh, it's one of those cities people tell you to like.
Richard said he thought you were happy out there.
Oh, great.
So now the illness makes him psychic.
You have to prepare yourself, Louis.
He's very changed.
I read the book.
Oh, God...
Exactly.
I thought you were meant to do more than just change people's names.
-Well...
-Isn't it meant to be fiction?
He even had you living on 10th Street.
It isn't me.
Isn't it?
You know how Richard is.
It's a fantasy.
A whole chapter on 'Should she buy some nail polish'?
And then, guess what? After
50 pages, she doesn't.
The whole thing seems to go on for eternity.
Nothing happens. And then, wham!
For no reason, she kills herself.
His mother kills herself.
Yeah, sure, his mother, but still for no reason.
-Well, I...
-Out of the blue.
I know the book is tough, but I liked it.
I know.
Only one thing upset me.
What's that? What upset you?
Well... that there wasn't more about you.
That's kind.
I went back to Wellfleet.
You did?
One day.
I didn't tell you?
No.
But then, I never see you.
You remember the house.
It's still there.
I think you're courageous.
Courageous? Why?
To dare go visit.
What I mean is... to face the fact that we have lost those feelings forever.
Shit!
-Clarissa?
-Um...
I don't know what's happening.
I'm sorry.
I seem to be in some strange sort of mood.
I'm sorry. It's, uh, it's very rude of me.
I seem to be unravelling.
I shouldn't have come.
No, it's not you. It's not you.
It's more like having a presentiment.
Do you know what I'm saying?
Oh, God, it's probably just nerves about the party, you know?
Bad hostess!
Clarissa, what's happened?
Jesus!
What is it?
Oh! Oh, God!
Do you want me to go?
No, don't go! Don't...
Don't go.
Explain to me why this is happening.
Don't... don't touch me. Jesus.
It's better if you don't.
It's just too much.
You fly in from San Francisco, and I've been nursing Richard for years.
And all the time,
I've held myself together... no problem.
I know.
One morning, in Wellfleet... you were there, we were all there...
I'd been sleeping with him, and I was out on the back porch.
He came out behind me, and he put his hand on my shoulder.
Good morning, Mrs. Dalloway.
That's...
That's when...
From then on, I've... been stuck.
Stuck?
Yep.
Yeah.
With the name, I mean.
And now you walk in.
To see you walk in... because I never see you. Look at you.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
It was you he stayed with.
It was you he lived with.
I had one summer.
The day I left him,
I got on a train and made my way across Europe.
I felt free for the first time in years.
- It was the moment...
They're all here, aren't they?
All the ghosts.
All of the ghosts are assembling for the party.
He's so weird.
Oh, what?
You can't see that?
You can't see that
Louis Waters is weird?
I can see that he's sad.
Well... all your friends are sad.
You've been crying.
What's happening?
All it is, I looked around this room, and I thought,
I'm giving a party. All I want to do is give a party.
And?
I know why he does it ; he does it deliberately.
Oh, is this Richard?
Of course.
He did it this morning.
He gives me that look.
What look?
To say...
Your life is... trivial.
You are so trivial.
Just... daily stuff, you know.
Schedules and parties and... details.
That's what he means... by it, that is what he's saying.
Mom, it only matters if you think it's true.
Well?
Do you? Tell me.
When I'm with him, I feel...
Yes, I am living.
And when I'm not with him...
Yes, everything does seem sort of s...
...silly.
I don't mean with you.
Oh, I... God. Jesus.
Never with you.
It's all the rest of it.
Sally?
The rest of it.
False comfort.
Because?
If you say to me,
When were you happiest?
Mom...
Tell me the moment you were happiest.
I know, I know, it was years ago.
Yeah.
All you're saying is... you were once young.
I remember one morning... getting up at dawn, there was such a sense of possibility.
You know?
That feeling?
Hmm?
And I remember thinking to myself,
So, this is the beginning of happiness.
This is where it starts.
And, of course, there will always be more.
It never occurred to me it wasn't the beginning.
It was happiness.
It was the moment... right then.
## Virginia
11/13/18, 09:50 - Talles: "Dearest, I feel certain, that I'm going mad again. I think we can't go through another of these terrible times and I shan't recover this time. I begin to hear voices and can't concentrate. So I'm doing what seems the best thing to do. You have given me the greatest possible happiness. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I know that I'm spoiling your life and without me, you could work and you will. I know. You see I can't even write this properly. What I want to say is that I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. Everything is gone for me, but the certainty of your goodness. I can't go on spoiling your life any longer. I don't think two people could have been happier than we have been. 
Virginia."
- you must eat
Good morning, Leonard.
Good morning, Virginia.
How was your sleep?
Uneventful.
The headaches?
No. No headaches.
Doctor seemed pleased.
That's all from this morning?
Yes. This young man has submitted his manuscript.
I've found three errors of fact and two spelling mistakes, and I'm not yet on page four.
Have you had breakfast?
Yes.
Liar.
Virginia, it's not my insistence.
It's your own doctor's.
I'm going to send Nelly up with some fruit and a bun.
Right. Lunch, then.
Proper lunch, husband and wife sitting down together... soup, pudding and all.
By force if necessary.
Leonard, I believe
I may have a first sentence.
Work, then.
Then you must eat.
- She'll kill herself over something which doesn't seem to matter
Do you think it's possible that bad writing actually attracts a higher incidence of error?
If it's all right, I thought
I might take a short walk.
Not far?
No. Just for air.
Go then.
If I could walk mid-morning,
I'd be a happy man.
She'll die.
She's going to die.
That's what's going to happen.
Huh.
That's it.
She'll kill herself.
She'll kill herself over something which doesn't seem to matter.
- Do you not pay heed to your doctors?
How did you know that?
I thought you never came to town.
That's because you no longer ask me.
Are you not forbidden to come?
Do the doctors not forbid it?
Oh, the doctors.
Do you not pay heed to your doctors?
Not when they're a bunch of contemptible Victorians.
So... what are you saying?
Are you feeling better?
Has this vastness made you stronger?
I'm saying, Vanessa, that even crazy people like to be asked.
Nessa! Nessa!
- Yes, the females are larger And less colourful.
Where did you find that?
I think it must have fallen from a tree.
Oh, my goodness.
Just look at him.
We might be able to save him.
Save him?
I think you have to be careful, Quentin.
There's a time to die, and it may be the bird's time.
Come on, let's pick some grass to make a grave.
-Oh, Julian.
-I'm just saying.
Then at least there'll be a bed for him to die on.
Come on, Nessa, let's make a grave.
Nessa, come on!
Oh... Very well, I'm coming.
Wait for me then.
Angelica, will you be all right?
Stay with your aunt.
You're going too fast.
Do you think she'd like roses?
Is it a she?
Yes, the females are larger.
And less colourful.
What happens when we die?
What happens?
We return to the place that we came from.
I don't remember where I came from.
Nor do I.
She looks very small.
Yes.
Yes, that's one of the things that happens... we look smaller.
But very peaceful.
Oh, is it done?
Have we finished?
Is the bird funeral complete?
Yes.
Very well, then.
- I fear I may have to kill someone else instead.
Virginia?
Virginia!
What are you thinking about?
Are you still with us?
Your aunt's a very lucky woman, Angelica... because she has two lives.
She has the life she's leading, and also the book she's writing.
This makes her very fortunate indeed.
What were you thinking about?
I was going to kill my heroine... but I've changed my mind.
I... I can't.
I fear I may have to kill someone else instead.
- You think I may one day escape?
You'll return to what?
Tonight?
Oh, just some... insufferable dinner.
Not even you could envy, Virginia.
But I do.
Say something, Nessa.
Didn't you think I seemed better?
Yes...
Yes... Virginia, you seemed better.
You think...
You think I may one day escape?
One day. One...
Nessa.
Nessa!
Come on, Nessa.
Come, Angelica, we must go.
Come on!
Good-bye.
Good-bye, little girl.
- No such obligation exists.
Mr. Woolf, what an unexpected pleasure.
Perhaps you could tell me exactly what you think you're doing?
What I was doing?
I went to look for you, and you weren't there.
You were working in the garden.
I didn't wish to disturb you.
You disturb me when you disappear.
I didn't disappear.
I went for a walk.
A walk?
Is that all? Just a walk?
Virginia, we must go home now.
Nelly's cooking dinner.
She's already had a very difficult day.
It's just our obligation to eat Nelly's dinner.
There is no such obligation.
No such obligation exists.
Virginia, you have an obligation to your own sanity.
I have endured this custody!
I have endured this imprisonment.
Oh, Virginia!
I am attended by doctors, everywhere.
I am attended by doctors who inform me of my own interests!
They know your interests.
They do not!
They do not speak for my interests.
Virginia, I can...
I can see that it must be hard for a woman of your...
Of what? Of my what, exactly?
Uh, your... your talents to see that she may not be the best judge of her own condition!
Who, then, is a better judge?
You have a history!
You have a history of confinement.
We brought you to Richmond because you have a history of fits, moods, blackouts, hearing voices.
We brought you here to save you from the irrevocable damage you intended upon yourself.
You've tried to kill yourself twice!
I live daily with that threat.
I set up the press... we set up the printing press not just for itself, not just purely for itself, but so that you might have a ready source of absorption and of remedy.
Like needlework?
It was done for you!
It was done for your betterment!
It was done out of love!
If I didn't know you better,
I'd call this ingratitude.
I am ungrateful?
You call me ungrateful?
My life has been stolen from me.
I'm living in a town
I have no wish to live in.
I'm living... a life
I have no wish to live.
How did this happen?
It is time for us to move back to London.
I miss London.
I miss London life.
This is not you speaking, Virginia.
This is an aspect of your illness.
-It's not you.
-It is me. It is my voice.
It's not your voice.
It's mine and mine alone.
This is the voice that you hear.
It is not! It is mine!
I'm dying in this town!
If you were thinking clearly, Virginia, you'd recall it was London that brought you low.
If I were thinking clearly...
If I were thinking clearly...
We brought you to Richmond to give you peace.
If I were thinking clearly, Leonard,
I would tell you that I wrestle alone in the dark, in the deep dark, and that only I can know, only I can understand my own condition.
You live with the threat... you tell me... you live with the threat of my extinction.
Leonard, I live with it, too.
This is my right.
It is the right of every human being.
I choose not the suffocating anaesthetic of the suburbs, but the violent jolt of the capital.
That is my choice.
The meanest patient, yes, even the very lowest is allowed some say in the matter of her own prescription.
Thereby she defines her humanity.
I wish, for your sake, Leonard,
I could be happy in this quietness.
But if it is a choice between
Richmond and death,
I choose death.
Very well, London, then.
We'll go back to London.
You hungry?
I'm a little hungry myself.
Come along.
London train on platform one!
This is the London train terminating at Vauxhall.
You cannot find peace by avoiding life, Leonard.
- You're my guy.
Hey. Hey, there, bug.
Hey, what's wrong?
Hi, Mrs. Latch.
Sorry I'm late.
He's fine.
He's been fine.
He's, he's just happy to see you.
Aw, it couldn't have been that bad, could it? Hmm?
So, you got it cut, then?
Oh, yes, yes. No problem.
Looks great.
Well, they didn't have to do very much.
Well, we had a fine time together.
Thank you very much.
So, that wasn't too bad, was it?
I wasn't gone too long.
No, you weren't long.
That's right.
At one point...
I don't know.
There was a moment where
I thought I might be longer.
But I changed my mind.
What is it, honey?
Mommy, I love you.
I love you, too, baby.
What's wrong?
What?
Don't worry, honey, everything's fine.
We're going to have a wonderful party, and we've made your daddy such a nice cake.
I love you, sweetheart.
You're my guy.
Mommy!
- Why does someone have to die?
Why does someone have to die?
Leonard...
In your book, you said someone had to die.
Hmm.
Why?
Is that a stupid question?
No.
I imagine my question is stupid.
Not at all.
Well?
Someone has to die in order that the rest of us should value life more.
It's contrast.
And who will die?
Tell me.
The poet will die.
The visionary.
- to look life in the face...
Dear Leonard, to look life in the face... always to look life in the face, and to know it for what it is.
At last, to know it, to love it for what it is, and then... to put it away.
Leonard... always the years between us, always the years... always... the love... always... the hours.
# Anatomy of a fall
SAMUEL
... I’m not just asking for these three days, it's bigger than that.
I'm talking about the overall organization. It's not working for me anymore, I’ve told you this.
SANDRA
What do you expect me to do? I’m not going to cancel, it’s part of the job, you'll have to organize yourself differently.
SAMUEL
How am I supposed to get organized differently on my own?
You know we have to plan things together. I’m not just going to leave Daniel alone because you’re off doing your own thing.
SANDRA
Leave him with Monica, what’s the big deal?
SAMUEL
3 days a week? She’s not at our disposal; we’d have to pay her for that! We can’t afford it! I need time, not just a few hours,
I’m talking about blocking out time for myself for the whole year. This isn’t working for me anymore.
SANDRA
So organize your time differently if you want to; it’s up to you…
(faisant référence aux pâtes) Mmm, it’s delicious.
SAMUEL
Sandra, when’s the last time you helped him with his homework? When did you replace his gaffer tape?
When have you ever taken Snoop to the vet? There’s a ton of things you don’t give a shit about, and that’s the time I’m talking about.
SANDRA (douce)
Darling, the book just came out, you know very well that it’s just this time –
SAMUEL
It's ALWAYS “just this time”! Whether you have a book out, or you're writing, or you need space to figure out what to write... or when you're invited who knows where... I’ve been following your lead for years and I’m not okay with it anymore. I can’t do anything with MY time, do you understand? It’s not my time, it’s yours.
SANDRA
Do I force you to teach? Do I force you to homeschool Daniel?
No one’s forcing you. If you want to make time for yourself you
I've never stopped you!
SAMUEL
Are you fucking serious? I cut my course load in half this year to gain time, and it's still not enough. I have to finish the renovation, PLUS I'm dealing with EVERYTHING else. Why do you refuse to talk about it? Why can't you just admit that it has to do with how things are divided between us?
SANDRA
Because you’re wrong, I don’t owe you any time, I do my part.
C'mon, let's not start taking inventory. Let’s relax. We love each other.
Chacun prend sur lui. Le silence s’étire, elle se verse du vin et lui en propose, il décline.
SANDRA
When you decided to homeschool Daniel 3 days a week, I told you: “ be careful,” it’s a beautiful and generous choice but you don’t have to; I told you that you’d end up…
(alt.: I told you it would force you)
SAMUEL (la coupant)
What? Having to spend more time with my son? Well I'm glad I didn't listen to you.
(alt.: Force me to spend time with my son? Well, I’m glad I did.)
I wouldn't have the relationship I have with him today if I had
(alt.: hadn’t).
SANDRA
The relationship I DON'T HAVE with him, you're saying?
SAMUEL
I didn't say that. I'm saying maybe, just maybe, things are little out of balance between us, and I'd like you to take a look at that.
Why is this so hard to discuss? 
SANDRA
First of all, I don't believe in the notion of reciprocity in a couple. It's naive and frankly depressing. And yes I think discussing it is a waste of time considering the state you’re in, seriously. All this blah blah blah and more time is gone; all this time spent chitchatting could be spent in silence, doing whatever you want, if only you knew what it is that you want.
SAMUEL
I want find time to write, just the same as you.
SANDRA
Then DO IT. I don’t know a single writer who’s not writing just because he’s got a son and a house and groceries to buy. Stop whining about your scheduling bullshit. Drop this logic which comes down to casting blame on me for what you did or didn’t do.
SAMUEL
I live with you, I plan my life around you. If I imposed on you what you’re imposing on me, neither of us would be able to write.
SANDRA
Oh, don’t you worry about me, I’ll always manage to write.
SAMUEL
Great, if you’re so sure of yourself, adapt – that’s all I’m asking.
SANDRA
I do adapt. I take Daniel to school.
SAMUEL
Once a week.
SANDRA
Yes, and we have Monica on Tuesdays.
SAMUEL
No, Sandra, you're being dishonest.
SANDRA
No I'm not, you're the one nitpicking! 
SAMUEL
I’ve given you too much – too much time, too many concessions. I want this time back and you owe it to me, be
FAIR!
SANDRA
Are you insane? I don't owe you anything. It’s because of
YOUR relationship with your son and to protect YOURSELF and YOUR comfort and because YOU got scared that you put yourself in this position. And it was YOUR choice to come here and start this renovation; it’s YOUR OWN trap, I’m not the one who’s taken time from you; you’ve wasted it all on YOUR
OWN, you can’t blame this on—
SAMUEL
Ok, now you're talking about the past, and I could respond to that point by point, but fuck that. I want things to change NOW.
I want time to start writing again.
SANDRA
Great, go for it! And if you want my advice, go back to the one you ditched.
SAMUEL
That's your advice? Go back to a book that you plundered?
SANDRA
Oh, so now it's plundering? We discussed it; you'd given up.
SAMUEL
You took the book’s best idea, how am I supposed to just “go back to it”? Do you realize how cynical that is? Ok.
SANDRA
Publish your version and say it inspired me, I'll admit to that! When something demands to be written, SOMEONE has to write it. It's almost Darwinian. Then again, it’s an idea that is so like me, I could have had it myself.
SAMUEL
That's so your vision of things! You have animal vision. You pretend to be obliging but your logic is savage.
SANDRA (fatigué)
Look at you, even your bullshit moralizing is a way for you to waste time. You should be flattered that I was inspired by you! 
That's life, things circulate. Frankly I hope you'll be inspired to
"plunder" me someday.
SAMUEL
Each in our own territory, we take what we need. EXCEPT
YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN YOUR JUNGLE, I LIVE WITH
YOU AND YOU IMPOSE EVERYTHING. You impose your rhythm, your use of time, you even impose the LANGUAGE!
Even when it comes to language, I’m the one meeting you on your turf: We speak English at home when Daniel should only hear French.
SANDRA
We hardly ever speak.
SAMUEL
You’ve never wanted to learn French, just like you’ve never sacrificed a second of your time. Everyone always has to meet you on your turf.
SANDRA
Bullshit, I'm not on my turf. I don't speak my mother tongue.
SAMUEL
Yes, but you don’t speak mine either! Even though we live here!
SANDRA
Well, yes, it’s a middle ground, in fact. I’m not French and you’re not German, but we don’t have to meet the other on their turf, we create a middle ground. That’s what English is for, it’s our meeting point, you can’t blame me for that.
SAMUEL
BUT WE LIVE IN FRANCE!!! THAT is our reality! Stop being evasive! Daniel hears you speak in a language that has nothing to do with his life. And you imposed this on him, like everything else. We’re on your turf, all the time, and I just have to follow.
SANDRA
But we’re in YOUR country. Every single day I have to accept living in your hometown.
The people you grew up with look down on me whenever I don’t make the effort to smile. You don't think me living here counts as meeting you on your turf?
SAMUEL
You never smile at anyone.
SANDRA
And that's why you love me, right? If you wanted some dumbass bitch who grins at your friends on the ski slopes, you'd have picked someone else!
Un temps. Sandra va s’allumer une cigarette, à l’autre bout de la pièce. Samuel la regarde.
SAMUEL
You really have no shame. That's your super-power, it allows you to see no one but yourself.
SANDRA
I see you very clearly. I just don't see you as a victim.
SAMUEL
You impose your way of living, eating, speaking and even fucking! I could never get you to fuck any other way! You just expect me to follow your lead. That’s your notion of what a couple is.
SANDRA
I don’t give a fuck about couples, I don’t have a “notion.” So I'm stopping you from fucking the way you want? Seriously?! Be honest: who's been refusing to fuck since the accident?
SAMUEL
You know damn well I meant before.
SANDRA
What did I ever refuse to do sexually?
SAMUEL
Everything. Plus I have to accept that you fuck other people.
SANDRA
I do not fuck other people!!
SAMUEL
Don’t deny it.
SANDRA
ONCE! And you cling to it in order to suffer. You do this all the time, you make yourself the victim. 
SAMUEL
I’m telling it like it is: you have fucked other people, SEVERAL
TIMES, and imposed it on me! I’m not a victim, I am a man scorned! Plundered, and scorned!
SANDRA
I can live without sex, but not forever.
SAMUEL
You're blaming me? I'm the one frustrating you?
SANDRA
It doesn't matter who's frustrating who. The frustration is there and we're both dealing with it. Personally, I refuse to rot inside, so I find solutions. At this point, sex is just a question of personal hygiene.
SAMUEL
You IMPOSE your solutions, which are solutions for YOU only.
You don't give a shit if it hurts me and Daniel.
SANDRA
I’m not imposing anything on Daniel. Don’t you talk about
Daniel. YOU made us live here among the goats! You complain about a life that YOU chose! You’re not a victim! Your generosity conceals something dirtier and meaner. Your incapable of facing your ambitions, and you resent me for it. But
I'm not the one who put you where you are. I have nothing to do with it. You aren't sacrificing yourself; you CHOOSE to sit on the sidelines because you're afraid! (You’re afraid because) your pride makes your head explode before you can even come up with a germ/an embryo of an idea! And now you wake up and you’re forty, and you need someone to blame. Well, YOU are to blame.
You’re petrified by your own standards and your fear of failure.
And THAT is the truth!! You're smart, and I know you know I'm right. And Daniel has nothing to do with it.
SAMUEL (la dispute continuant)
You’re a monster. Even Daniel says so, in his own words.
SANDRA
Take back what you just said, you piece of shit!!
SAMUEL
He’s told me countless times you’re too hard/cruel, did you know that?
SANDRA
TAKE THAT BACK! Kids want to please their parents. Daniel
's telling you what you want to hear!! He can feel your guilt, and he wants to reassure you. You've never stopped feeling guilty about him.
SAMUEL
You're a cold-hearted, selfish MONSTER. You're shameless, callous, you have no pity.
SANDRA
And you have way too much for yourself!
SAMUEL (criant)
YOU'RE SO COLD! I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE OF YOUR
FUCKING ICE, IT'S BRUTAL! VIOLENT! YOU'RE VIOLENT!
DO YOU HEAR ME?
SANDRA (criant d’autant plus fort et de manière effrayante)
I'M VIOLENT BECAUSE YOU’VE BECOME
INSUBSTANTIAL!!!! DROP DEAD! I CAN'T TAKE ANY
MORE OF YOUR MEDIOCRITY!! JUST DIE !! DISAPPEAR !
- Daniel
Marge, come quick, please!
What is it?
I gave him aspirin,
I messed up bad.
- You gave him aspirin?
- Yes!
How much?
8 or 10, I can't remember.
A lot.
Make him vomit.
Why'd you do that?
Make him vomit! Please!
OK, hang on.
"Make a dog vomit."
Hang on.
We need saltwater.
Be right back.
He's not moving.
Daniel, help me.
Open his mouth.
Easy.
That's right.
That's good.
He's coming around.
- What's happening?
- He's going to vomit.
That's it.
He'll be OK.
Good dog.
He's OK, he's breathing.
Looking at us.
Can you explain?
You know, I...
I'd never heard about... my dad's suicide attempt.
I'd never heard about... the shrink, the medicine... the vomit and aspirin.
When my mom talked about it,
I remembered something from around that time.
One morning,
Snoop was lying on my bedroom floor.
Not moving.
He smelled like vomit.
I figured he'd vomited.
I cleaned his muzzle.
I figured he'd...
I don't know, caught a virus or something, because... he acted strange for days.
He just slept or drank.
See? Now I'm thinking maybe he ate my dad's vomit, and "that" made him sick, and Mom told the truth!
So my experiment with the aspirin was to see how he'd react.
And you saw.
He slept for 14 hours.
Now he's drinking all the time.
He smells exactly the same!
Everything!
Everything's exactly the same!
But since..
Since yesterday,
I'm not sure if I believe her or not.
I knew they fought, but...
It wasn't...
I didn't think it was that violent.
Your memories are all you're sure of, and it's important to tell the jury.
But you're just a witness.
Do you think she could've killed him?
It's not for me to judge.
I know, but you could at least tell me!
I can't answer that.
My role is to protect you...
Fucking help me!
Actually, when we lack an element to judge something, and the lack is unbearable, all we can do is decide.
You see?
To overcome doubt, sometimes we have to... decide to sway one way rather than the other.
Since you need to believe one thing but have two choices, you must choose.
So you have to invent your belief?
Yes, well... in a sense.
So that means, I'm not sure... and you're saying
I have to pretend I'm sure?
No, I'm saying decide.
That's different.
What strikes me is we don't know who's more lyrical.
- The author or the character?
- Both, no doubt!
- Dad kills himself
I want to say something else.
Since my dog was sick for days,
Dad and I went to the vet.
Dad was really quiet in the car.
He didn't even play music.
He usually always does.
After a while, he started talking about Snoop.
He said,
"You know, he could get sick."
"Even die. You know that.
You need to be ready."
I didn't want to hear that.
Snoop was doing better.
He was still young.
He'd never been sick.
I told him he wasn't going to die.
But he kept going.
He said, "You need to be aware of it.
It'll happen someday."
"And it's no wonder Snoop gets tired."
"He's not so young in dog years."
"Can you imagine his life?"
"He's not just any dog."
"He's a great dog."
"An outstanding dog."
"Think about it.
He anticipates your needs,"
"foresees your movements,"
"keeps you safe from danger."
"He spends his life imagining your needs"
"thinking about what you can't see."
"Maybe he's tired."
"Always caring for others."
"Maybe one day, he'll be done."
"That could happen."
And I remember at the end, he said, "One day",
"when it's time for him to go, he'll go."
"You won't be able to help it.
Prepare yourself, it'll be hard."
"But it won't be the end of your life."
He meant himself.
Now...
Now I know he meant himself.
# The Banshees of Inesherin
Well, where is he? Just sittin' there.
Sittin' there doin' what?
Sittin' there doing nothin'.
Smokin'.
Have ye been rowin'?
I don't think we've been rowin'.
Sounds like ye've been rowin'.
It does sound like we've been rowin'.
Will I try him again?
That'd be the best thing.
Howdo, Padraic.
Sit somewhere else.
Huh?
Uh... But I have me pint there, Colm.
He has his pint there, Colm, from when he came in and ordered his pint from before.
Okay.
I'll sit somewhere else, so.
Are ye rowin'?
I didn't think we were rowin'.
Well, ye are rowin'.
Well, ye are rowin'.
He's sittin' outside on his own like a whatchamacallit.
It does look like we're rowin'.
Well, I suppose
I'd best go talk to him, so.
See what all this is fecking about.
That'd be the best thing.
Now I'm sittin' here next to you, and if you're goin' back inside,
I'm followin' you inside, and if you're goin' home,
I'm followin' you there, too.
Now, if I've done somethin' to ya, just tell me what I've done to ya.
And if I've said somethin' to ya, maybe I said somethin' when
I was drunk, and I've forgotten it, but I don't think I said somethin' when
I was drunk, and I've forgotten it.
But if I did, then tell me what it was, and I'll say sorry for that too, Colm.
With all me heart, I'll say sorry.
Just stop running away from me like some fool of a moody schoolchild.
But you didn't say anything to me.
And you didn't do anything to me.
That's what I was thinking, like.
I just don't like you no more.
You do like me.
I don't.
But you liked me yesterday.
Oh, did I, yeah?
I thought you did.
Padraic.
Dominic.
What's the matter with ya?
There's nothing the matter with me, for God's sake.
Look at this I found.
A stick with a hook.
What would you use it for, I wonder?
To hook things that were the length of a stick away?
Oh, be off to the pub now, Padraic, if you're gonna be annoyin' us.
I don't have to be down there every night, do I?
ColmSonnyLarry's scared him off, I suppose.
What did you hear of ColmSonnyLarry?
Didn't you and he used to be the best of friends?
We're still the best of friends.
No, you're not. Who says we're not?
She says.
Ah, for God's sake, Siobhan.
I said nothing of the like,
Mrs. McCormick! I was just chatting.
Now, you go off to Jonjo's, Padraic, and don't be getting under our feet.
Sure, Mrs. McCormick never gets a chance to come over for a chat.
She never gets a chance 'cause you avoid her.
I do not avoid her!
You hide behind walls if she's coming up the road.
I do not! h... hide behind walls.
Good luck to ye.
Daddy'll kill us if we wake him when he's been wanking.
You won't get into trouble for taking his poteen?
I will get into trouble, but fuck it.
I saw cannon-fire and rifle-fire on the mainland tonight.
Did you see it?
That'll be the Civil War.
I know that, sure.
Me, I pay no attention to wars. I'm agin 'em.
Wars and soap.
I tell you this much.
We're good at chatting, aren't we?
Me and you?
Your sister, does she like to chat?
Not as much as most women, but she'll chat, like.
She more likes reading.
Reading?
Feckin' hell.
Reading.
And did you ever see her with no clothes on?
I didn't.
Did you not, and you her brother?
Not even as a child?
I don't like to be chattin' about these types of things, Dominic!
What types of things?
Sisters with no clothes on!
You saw my daddy with no clothes on.
And till the day I die,
I'll wish I hadn't.
Sure, don't I know it.
The tiny, brown cock on him.
What's the matter with him?
Maybe bad news he's had?
Daddy?
No, ColmSonnyLarry.
Didn't I tell ya I'd be off if you went whining about that lummox one more time?
I tell ya, it didn't look like he had bad news tonight.
It looked like a weight was lifted from his shoulders tonight.
How's the book?
It's sad.
Sad?
Well, you should read a not sad one, Siobhan, else you might get sad.
Hmm.
Do you never get lonely, Padraic?
Never get what?
Lonely.
Do I never get lonely?
What's the matter with everybody?
Jesus.
"Lonely." Fecking hell.
Oh, so you're gonna be an eejit again today, is it?
Amn't I allowed to have a quiet pint on me own, Padraic?
Well, don't ask a man to call up to ya at your fecking house, so, like he has nothing better to do with his fecking time.
I didn't ask you to call up to me at me house.
And you do have nothing better to do with your fecking time.
Huh?
You do have nothing better to do with your fecking time.
I know I've nothing better to do with me fecking time, but there's better things I could be doing with me fecking time than to be calling up to ya at your house, Colm Doherty!
Like what?
Huh?
Like what else could you be doin'?
Reading.
Reading, yeah?
Me, this morning... this I wrote.
Tomorrow, I'll write the second part of it.
And the day after, I'll write the third part of it.
And by Wednesday, there'll be a new tune in the world, which wouldn't have been there if I'd spent the week listening to your bollocks,
Padraic Suilleabhain.
I was too harsh yesterday.
Yesterday, he says.
I know well you was too harsh yesterday.
And today.
I just, uh...
I just have this tremendous sense of time slippin' away on me, Padraic.
And I think I need to spend the time I have left thinking and composing.
Just trying not to listen to any more of the dull things that you have to say for yourself.
But I'm sorry about it.
I am, like.
Are you dying?
No, I'm not dying.
But then you've loads of time.
For chatting?
Aye.For aimless chatting?
Not for aimless chatting.
For good, normal chatting.
So, we'll keep aimlessly chatting and me life'll keep dwindling.
And in 12 years, I'll die with nothin' to show for it bar the chats I've had with a limited man, is that it?
I said, "Not aimless chatting."
I said, "Good, normal chatting."
The other night, two hours you spent talking to me about the things you found in your little donkey's shite that day.
Two hours, Padraic.
I timed it.
Well, it wasn't me little donkey's shite, was it?
It was me pony's shite, which shows how much you were listenin'.
None of it helps me, do you understand?
None of it helps me.
We'll just chat about somethin' else then.
Hey! What the hell's going on with you and me fecking brother?
Don't come in here shouting the odds at me in the middle of the fecking day, all right, Siobhan?
You can't just all of a sudden stop being friends with a fella!
Why can't I?
Why can't ya?
Because it isn't nice.
Do you want a sherry, Siobhan?
No!Righty-ho.
Has he said somethin' to ya when he was drunk?
No, I prefer him when he's drunk.
It's all the rest of the time
I have the problem with.
What's the fecking matter, then?
He's dull, Siobhan.
He's what?
He's dull.
But he's always been dull.
What's changed?
I've changed.
I just don't have a place for dullness in me life anymore.
But you live on an island off the coast of Ireland, Colm.
What the hell are you hoping for, like?
For a bit of peace, Siobhan.
That's all.
For a bit of peace in me heart, like.
You can understand that.
Can't ya?
Can't ya?
Do you think I'm dull?
No. 'Cause you're not dull, you're nice.
That's what I thought.
I mean, I'm a happy lad.
Or I was.
Till me best friend started acting the gilly-gooly.
It's him, Padraic.
Maybe he's just depressed.
That's what I was thinking, that he's depressed.
Well, if he is, he could at least keep it to himself, like.
You know, push it down, like the rest of us.
- No, Jenny!
- Out!
Out!
She just wants a bit of company, Siobhan.
Animals is for outside,
I've told ya.
And people don't be laughing at me behind me back, do they?
No. Why would they be?
They don't think I'm dim or anything?
Dim?
No.
You don't seem very sure about it.
Of course, I'm sure about it.
Dominic's the dim one on the island, isn't he?
He is, aye. By miles.
Uh, hang on, by miles.
And then, who's the next dimmest?
Well, I don't like to judge people in those terms now, do I?
In what terms?In order of their dimness.
Well, I know you don't.
And neither do I, do I?
But try, like.No!
I won't try.
There's enough judgy people on this fecking island, so no!
You're not dim!
You're a nice man, all right?
So, move on!
I'm as clever as you, anyways.
I know that at least.
Yeah, don't be fecking stupid.
# Past Lives
- Hi, my love.
How was it?
You were right.
I was?
Yeah.
He came here to see me.
It's so crazy to see him be this grown-up man with a normal job and a normal life.
He's so Korean.
He still lives with his parents, which is really Korean.
And he has all these really Korean views about everything.
And I feel so not Korean when I'm with him.
But also, in some way, more Korean?
It's so weird.
I mean, I have Korean friends, but he's not, like, Korean-American.
He's Korean-Korean.
Is he attractive?
I think so.
He's really masculine in this way that I think is so Korean.
Are you attracted to him?
I don't think so.
I don't know, I mean... I don't think so.
He was just this kid in my head for such a long time.
And then he was just this image on my laptop.
And now he's a physical person.
It's really intense, but I don't think that that's attraction,
I think I just missed him a lot.
I think I miss Seoul.
Did he miss you?
I think he missed the 12-year-old crybaby he knew a long time ago.
- You were a crybaby?
- Yeah.
Most of the time he'd have to just stand there and watch me.
When is he leaving, again?
- The morning after tomorrow.
- Mm-hmm.
Are you mad?
No.
It feels like you are.
I don't have a right to be mad.
What do you mean? Of course you do.
No, I... That guy flew
13 hours to be here.
I'm not gonna tell you that you can't see him or something.
He's your childhood sweetheart.
And it's not like you're gonna run away with him.
Are you?
Definitely.
I'm gonna throw away my life here...
...and run away with him to Seoul.
Do you even know me?
I'm not gonna miss my rehearsals for some dude.
I know.
I know you.
What?
I was just thinking about what a good story this is.
- The story of Hae Sung and me?
- Yeah.
I just can't compete.
What do you mean?
Childhood sweethearts who reconnect 20 years later only to realize they were meant for each other.
- We're not meant for each other.
- I know.
I know.
In the story, I would be the evil white American husband standing in the way of destiny.
Shut up.
Well think about it?
Our story is just so boring.
We met at an artists' residency.
Slept together because we both happened to be single.
We realized we both live in New York, so, we moved in together to save money on rent.
We got married so you could get a green card. So...
- Oh, you make it sound so romantic.
- Right, that's what I'm saying.
I'm the guy you leave in the story when your ex-lover comes to take you away.
He's not my ex-lover.
What if you met somebody else at that residency?
What if there was another writer from New York who had also read all the same books you had, and watched all the same movies, who could give you useful notes on your plays, and listen to you complain about your rehearsals?
- That's not how life works.
- I know.
Yeah.
But wouldn't you be laying here with him?
This is my life, and I'm living it with you.
Are you happy with it?
Is this what you imagined for yourself when you left Seoul?
When I was a 12-year-old?
Yeah. Is this what you pictured for yourself?
Laying in bed in some... tiny apartment in the East Village with some Jewish guy who writes books?
Is that what your parents wanted for you?
You're asking me if you,
Arthur Zaturansky, are the answer to my family's immigrant dream?
- Yeah.
- Wow.
This is where I ended up.
This is where I'm supposed to be.
Okay.
What?
It's just that you make my life so much bigger.
And I'm wondering if I do the same thing for you.
You do.
I'm just a girl from Korea, you know.
And you're forgetting the part where I love you.
I don't forget that. I have trouble believing it sometimes.
Do you know you only speak in Korean when you talk in your sleep?
- I do?
- Yeah.
You never sleep-talk in English.
You only dream in Korean.
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.
You never told me that.
Well, sometimes I think it's cute.
Sometimes, I don't know,
I guess I get scared.
Scared of what?
You dream in a language that I can't understand.
It's like there's this whole place inside of you where I can't go.
I think that's why I've been trying to learn Korean, even though I know it's annoying for you.
You want to understand me when I'm dreaming?
Yeah.
I'm sure I'm just saying gibberish.
- Yi-yun
He's talking about you.
I'm sorry we speak alone.
Uh, we will stop.
It's okay.
You haven't seen each other in a long time.
I never thought I'd be a part of something like this.
Hm?
Sitting here with you.
Do you know what In-Yun?
Yeah. Nora told me about it when we first met.
You and me.
Yeah. Yeah, you and I are In-Yun too.
Right?
I'm really glad you came here.
It was the right thing to do.
Um, I'm gonna walk him to his Uber.
Okay.
Uh, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
Uh, come visit me in Korea.
Definitely.
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.
# V for Vendetta
Valerie, V for vendetta 
WOMAN'S VOICE:
I know there's no way I can convince you this is not one of their tricks, but I don't care.
I am me.
My name is Valerie.
I don't think I'll live much longer.
I wanted to tell someone about my life.
This is the only autobiography that I will ever write and, God,
I'm writing it on toilet paper.
I was born in Nottingham in 1985.
I don't remember much of those early years but I do remember the rain.
My grandmother owned a farm in Tottle Brook and she used to tell me that God was in the rain.
I passed my 11 Plus and went to girls' grammar.
It was at school that I met my first girlfriend.
Her name was Sarah.
It was her wrists.
They were beautiful.
I thought we would love each other forever.
I remember our teacher telling us that it was an adolescent phase that people outgrew.
Sarah did.
I didn't.
In 2002, I fell in love with a girl named Christina.
That year I came out to my parents.
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
VALERIE: I couldn't have done it without Chris holding my hand.
My father wouldn't look at me.
He told me to go and never come back.
[WOMAN CRYING]
VALERIE: My mother said nothing.
But I'd only told them the truth.
Was that so selfish?
Our integrity sells for so little, but it is all we really have.
It is the very last inch of us.
But within that inch, we are free.
MAN:
It ends whenever you want it to.
- Just tell us where he is.
- I don't know.
VALERIE: I'd always known what I wanted to do with my life and in 2015, I starred in my first film,
The Salt Flats.
It was the most important role of my life.
Not because of my career, but because that was how I met Ruth.
The first time we kissed,
I knew I never wanted to kiss any other lips but hers again.
We moved to a small flat in London together.
She grew Scarlet Carsons for me in our window box and our place always smelt of roses.
Those were the best years of my life.
But America's war grew worse and worse and eventually came to London.
The bill proposed by the Undersecretary for Defense, Adam Sutler to close the remaining tube stations passed with near-universal...
VALERIE:
After that, there were no roses anymore.
Not for anyone.
MAN: You won't last much longer.
You're gonna die here.
Why protect someone who doesn't give a shit about you?
[DOOR SLAMS, LOCKS]
VALERIE: I remember how the meaning of words began to change.
How unfamiliar words like "collateral" and "rendition" became frightening, while things like "Norsefire" and the
"Articles of Allegiance" became powerful.
I remember how "different" became dangerous.
I still don't understand it, why they hate us so much.
[GRUNTS]
VALERIE: They took Ruth while she was out buying food.
I've never cried so hard in my life.
It wasn't long till they came for me.
It seems strange that my life should end in such a terrible place.
But for three years,
I had roses and apologized to no one.
I shall die here.
Every inch of me shall perish.
Every inch but one.
An inch.
It is small, and it is fragile and it is the only thing in the world worth having.
We must never lose it or give it away.
We must never let them take it from us.
I hope that, whoever you are, you escape this place.
I hope that the world turns and that things get better.
But what I hope most of all is that you understand what I mean when I tell you that even though I do not know you and even though
I may never meet you, laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you...
I love you.
With all my heart,
I love you.
Valerie.
MAN: I'm instructed to inform you that you have been convicted by special tribunal and that unless you are ready to offer your cooperation, you are to be executed.
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
- Yes.
- Are you ready to cooperate?
- No.
- Very well.
Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell.
Arrange a detail of six men and take her out behind the chemical shed and shoot her.
MAN: It's time.
I'm ready.
MAN: Look, all they want is one little piece of information.
Just give them something, anything.
Thank you, but I'd rather die behind the chemical sheds.
MAN: Then you have no fear anymore.
You're completely free.

The power of ideas
05/06/24
What are the gonna do? 
Kill me? I am making fun of them in national television. 
Are they really gonna kill after that? 
With the whole nation knowing that they did it. 
I don't think so. 
Let him have his moment. 
He's a child having a tantrum. Sooner or later he's gonna realize what a stupid thing he's done.
Throwing away an opportunity like this for playing dress up. 
Dressing like a girl, wearing makeup, doing obscene gestures, painting Christ as gay. That's absurd. 
Order and progress. 
Let it go. 
I'm concerned. 
I shouldn't be afraid of losing my diploma. 
I shouldn't be afraid of fighting in court. 
I should've fought in court too. 
TV or court. 
The impact it would've had. 
Who would be the judge of that? 
It was a court that I didn't believe in. 
It was a judge I didn't believe. 
There was no court in this country that could've be reasonable. 
That would put a stop to what they were doing. 
Psychoanalysis came for me to sort out a new plan. 
To fix what happened. 
How can we limit supposedly boundless people? 
Jesus. 
It started off like solving a family issue to limiting everyone. 
Spying on everyone. 
Well, it's data. 
It's data provided by the users. 
We've already provided all this information. 
It's there already. 
We can use it for psychoanalysis. 
It's a thing. It's a modern problem. 
Atomic bomb. 
The age privacy and data. 
Life online. 
The crimes of the government. 
Pandemia. Vaccine. Security. Censorship. Terrorists. 
War. Life on war. Billionaires. 
Where do they come from? What's their stories. 
Zuckerberg. Gates. Tesla. Vuitton. And others. 
China. Israel. Usa. Germany. France. Russia. Japan. Brasil. 
Transmissão. 
Eve is V's child. 
They create V. And reproduced. That's their legacy. Their descent. Their heritage. 
That's what they left. 
It was them. Their way.
Then you have no fear anymore. You're completely free. 
I created a lie but you found something real. 
It was monstrous. 
You tortured me. 
I feel nothing. 
Don't run away. 
You were calm. 
You found something beyond your own life. 
Something. 
Why do we want to reproduce? 
To produce? 
Because it's jouissance. 
Because that's what animals do. It's what people do. 
We create things. 
We pro-create.
Life urges. 
What happens after we reproduce? 
We testify to the development of our creation. 
If we could start over. 
If you could fix. 
What do we create? 
Alienated in our own art. 
Not knowing. 
Does our creation love us? 
Love-hate. 
And they live their own lives. 
That's it. 
We reproduce. We nurture. We die. 
Wouldn't it be nice to think that we start over after we die. 
Repetition that's not the same. 
But it's not completely different either. 
It's possible. 
Who controls matter creation? 
Atoms. After we deteriorated, where do our atoms go? 
Together. 
We're all one and only, aren't we? 
We're all connected. 
And also separated. 
Strings, waves, matter. 
That's what people do. 
Why do we cry? 
From the moment we enter crying to the moment we live dying, it'll just cover your face as you wail and cry and scream and laugh, and feel, and love, and work, and jouissance. 
We feel, we feel. 
What you really need is a story. 
Why? Because games have taken my brother away from the family. Because melancholia is there. 
Because it's interesting and exciting.
And I want to do it. 
Because it's already happening. 
Because I want to be a billionaire. 
Because I want to live in LA. 
Because I want to have children. 
Because I want to be a part of it. 
Because there are hours after hours. 
Because I'm young and smart and full of energy. 
Because a person has to be someplace doing something. 
Because the unconscious won't stop till death. Does it stop after death? I don't know. 
I don't know what'll happen after I die. 
I don't know where do dead people go? 
If they have to be somewhere. Doing something. 
But we have hours to face. 
Do we better do something fun. 
Because it's fun. 
Let's have fun, people. 
# The big bang theory
The constants that I can count on. 
Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back his affection with an empty financial gesture.
Sheldon and Amy did it. 
When our kids grow when can Airbnb it - wood house -  to other kids.
How you decide anything. Think about it with your brain, plan it, test it. Then send it to me.
I had to get out of the house. My husband kept trying to have sex with me. 
It seems to be more trouble than it's worth. 
She was gonna find out eventually. 
Disagree. We know evolution since 1859. She still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. 
This is how marriage works: you pretend you don't know.
Experimenting with babies. 
I was so sure and I was wrong. 
So now you're gonna reevaluate your whole life? 
Amazing how it all comes back
The greater you care about something, the greater the fear of losing it.
Grieving is a process. Every culture has its traditions to facilitate it. 
It has been so much fun with you, except it... hasn't. 
I remember everything I said. It was good, I just thought it'd be more coming from me. 
Face failure and stepbacks. 
You can't fund your own project. It turns out that I can, and I did it. 
Denying things left and right. 
It was so sexy. I'm not gonna give it to you. 
No. No. No. 
You came into our lab in the middle of the night and took all of our work and research and didn't even tell us. So you're gonna take all the work we've done in the past year and just toss us aside? yes.
This is all very upsetting. 
As you know the primary focus of the military is people's feelings. 
Children. They're cute but they're ruining everything. 
Finances and taxes. Themes and flowers. 
Are these the hormones or have you always been a lunatic?
At this point, I don't even know anymore.
It's so hard. How do I choose? 
Can't make everybody happy. Deal with it. 
Like a secret club?
Is there some sort of humiliation-initiation? Cause I'd do anything. 
I was thinking that one of us should stay at home. 
So I have to give up my job and everything I've worked for. 
Actually, I was thinking that I should stay. 
So I have to abandon my children and go back to work while you get to stay home and bond with them. 
You can't criticize something you haven't seen. 
Excuse me, are you familiar with the internet?
You've never cared about what people thought, even when you, really, really, should. 
I have a lot of female colleagues, but they're all Freudians, so the only man I can dish about is my father. 
Let's be clear. I married you to hurt her. 
The collaboration contamination.
The best foreplay is rigid adherence to a strict schedule.
I was acting oddly intentionally. 
Really, so you can control it? 
Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin. Look at the contributions he made. 
If you don't know how to make lasagna, Google does. 
The timelapse between intent and awareness. 
You need to stop hanging out with your brain. It's not a good influence. 
My dad thinks the reason I can't get in a relationship is that I'm spoiled. 
The emotional detection automation. 
Meeting with exes in order to receive feedback on why they broke up with Raj. 
You're better than us. A bit sorry for us. Mostly glad you don't have to be us. 
When I said I was fine I meant I didn't want to talk about it anymore.
Struggle with recognizing emotional cues. 
I want to understand myself. What do I want? 
What have I done? 
My language. Dear people. Memories. 
State of language. Strategy and plan years ahead. 
I knew I had problems, but that machine made them so real. 
If I solve it for you, you'll never learn. 
I'm struggling with the thought of leaving my own bedroom. 
Can't it be more of an internal struggle? 
You're very persistent. 
Well, it's my one move. 
The flamenco. 
Raj, have some compassion. Those are the things we think and not say. 
Let's make a contract. 
An experiment and collect data on our compatibility
Well, clearly I lied
Anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone.
I've always valued education over money. 
I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer. 
An app that allows Hire people to do errands. 
Like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability. 
Storage unit. Armazém. 
Virtual Reality Console. 
Time in Wilderness for clarity. Cleaning thoughts. 
I was just hungry and cranky. And I've never been called old before. 
I know you're feeling lonely but sometimes is better to take a little time for yourself and reevaluate. Maybe Psychoanalysis. 
Pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information that that environment isn't good for us. 
Cleaning up is not young and fun. 
Why did you bring him? 
I had to. We married now. 
If you can't support me when I'm lying why are we married? 
A series of challenges. Math and whatever to get my contact information. 
Like I'm the prize. 
I believe you're using humor to avoid vulnerability.
I'm just playing a videogame while Bernadette does the taxes.
She thought she could cure anything with her food.
Intellectuals entertain each other. Gather. Woolf and her friends. 
Back to G15. Conduct the conversation in an elevated and insightful way. It's all about the execution. 
I'm not sure I have a dominant leg. 
I can't say for sure, but that rabbit looked me right in the eye before jumping in front of the car wheels. 
Excuse me. I've been recovering from a recent breakup, and I'm told asking another man might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu "I choose you".
Some guys you have to turn them over and over. 
What happens if you imagine him naked? 
I've realized I've become too emotionally vulnerable so, like an operating system,  I'm restoring my life to the last stable version. 
The time commitment to start watching a new tv show. If I'm in, I'm in for the whole run, even if the quality declines. 
Reward-based environment. 
I don't really feel like I deserve it. 
There's more than one way to raise a child.
That's something to think about. 
Oh you're gonna think about it right here?
I went to school for half of my life. I have a doctorate. I'm still paying college loans. 
Penny makes twice his salary in sales. 
Sheldon changing fields from String theory to dark matter. 
Being on the top and going to the bottom. 
I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really is kind of what I think love looks like. 
When it's our kid that's ruined my body, kept me up all night and I've got no career, no future, nothing to be happy about for 20 years. 
I asked your Dad what things you liked to do when you were a kid. To plan something fun. 
Did that feel good? Feel like a big man now? 
While my brother was getting an STD, I was getting a Ph.D. 
Penicillin can't take this away.
What I want is for us to be planning our futures together.
Sheldon telling a joke about physics mad libs. 
Mockingbirds can change their song which means he's out of tune of purpose. He's mocking me. 
You either way something meaningful, from heart to heart, or you and I are done. 
Amy vs Bernadette. 
Then maybe you should spank me harder. 
I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Insteado of leaving santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning you could tell he'd been there cause the paper would be graded. 
I've got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. One of them could end up in the backseat of her car. 
Are you feeling insecure? Because that's my thing , and if you take it away, I don't know what I'm bringing to this relationship. 
Bernie's been a little cranky since she's been working 17 hours a day. And I've got a lot on my plate too, because I've been busting my tail playing assassin's creed. 
This whole thing is a waste of our time. Helping anyone. People should take care of themselves. 
Raj's date over texting at a library. 
They have to help the viewers let go. Buffy the vampire continued as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended. 
You don't know what is like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release. 
I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek. 
Raj's talking to women. 
Brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they're yours, then they're a drag. 
You're husband is weird and his clothes are ridiculous. Amy. 
You're having to process you emotional pain without vodka. 
Let's talk about our lives. Oh I miss it so much. 
No one likes a know-it-all, Penny. 
Howard and Amy singing together.

Plot holes. 
Critical analysis: The masculinity fragility jokes. Rajaseh is great. 
Gordophobia. Mental health. Being weird and socially awkward. Being dumb. Relationship jokes. Science. Racism. Meat food. 
The elements of comedy. Critical Theory. 
Bernadette's laugh. 
And judging by her lack of Adam's apple, she's been female her entire life. I like that in a woman.

Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. 
Our relationship agreement covers a wide array of changing scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising.

Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who goes out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone. 
I'm glad I got that mocha. I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car. 
I don't need to be famous or do "something big" to be happy. 
I need a process. 
Making fun of immigration. Third world country jobs in the US. 
Leonard talking to Sheldon about their separation. About moving out. About change. I was thinking of us moving together with not you. 
I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. I'm just getting on a train and leaving forever. 
Everything is changing and is simply too much. 
No one is paying attention to you. 
I called Leonard because I failed and I didn't want you to think less of me. 
The correct animal for interspecies supersoldier is a koala. It would wind up an army so cute it couldn't be attacked. 
I can't believe I'm gonna waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students. 
I'll use that to lighten the mood after half the class fails midterm. 
How about you make it gradually? 
What about two nights I stay with Penny.
One night and... I let you whistle... When I'm not home. 
The reason that I'm not progressing in this job is that I've created too pleasant an environment for myself. In order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. 
If makeup is so truthful then why is it called concealer? 
I know how to deal with Sheldon being Sheldon not with Sheldon being a rational thoughtful person. That's absurd. 
He's thinking of me and my feelings and trying to be respectful.

29min.
Without the glasses, you're not even ugly.
How do I look?
Like Clark Kent. Now Superman.
There's nothing more naked than your handwriting.
That's vanity. 
We certainly know that's true.
Do you have any brothers?
All only child. 
What does that mean?
Means we never shared a bath. 
And I'm cold. Can I get in?
No. 
I didn't mean with you in it. 
Okay. 
It's me. It's an old picture. Every time.
50min. 
Suddenly I'm quite happy to be going back. 
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I don't think I did, did I? 
Why are you asking all of sudden? 
No reason. Because you're leaving I guess.
I don't think you were there.  
Why?
I mean it as a compliment. You have such great taste
Most thuds of Princeton have tasted everything and have no taste.
I used to say "the cream of America, rich and thick"
Freddie is the perfect example. 
Then I'll take it as a compliment. 
I knew it. Marge and I had a bet. 
Do you even like jazz or was that for my benefit? 
I've gotten to like it. 
Oh yes. 
I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. 
It's one big love affair. 
If you knew my life back in NY... 
I'm thinking of giving up the sax. What do you think about the drums? So cool. 
This is how I found my place in Mongie. Took a boat around the bay. First thing I liked I got it. 
Marge, his young lady, is supposedly writing some kind of book.
God only knows what he does.
By all accounts, they spend the whole time on the beach or in a sailboat.
That's my son's talent, spending his allowance.
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom?
Persuade my son to come home? I'd pay you. A thousand dollars.
Well, I have always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Good. Now you can go for a reason.
- What's your secret?
- Excuse me?
No, it's just that...
You are American, aren't you?
No, it's just that...
I have so much luggage, and you're so, um, streamlined.
It's, you know, humiliating.
(Speaks Italian)
I'm Meredith, by the way.
- Hello, I'm Dickie.
- Meredith Randall.
- Um, Dickie Greenleaf.
- Hello.
You're not the shipping Greenleafs.
Oh, trying not to be.
Trying to jump ship.
So, uh, did they put your cases in the wrong pile?
It's just that, uh, you were in the "R" stand.
I thought I saw you there...
My father wants me back in New York.
He builds boats, I'd rather sail them.
So I travel under my mother's name.
- Which is...
- Emily.
I'm just kidding.
You know, the funny thing is,
I'm not Randall either.
I'm Logue.
- As in...
- As in the textile Logues.
Trying to shrug off the dress.
- I travel under my mother's name too.
- Randall.
Right.

Dickie Greenleaf?
- Who's that?
- It's Tom. Tom Ripley.
Tom Ripley?
- We were at Princeton together.
- (Dickie) Okay.
Did we know each other?
Hello.
Well, I knew you, so...
I suppose you must have known me.
Princeton's like a fog.
America's like a fog.
This is Marge Sherwood.
Tom... Sorry, what is it?
- Ripley.
- How do you do?
How do you do, Marge?
- What are you doing in Mongi?
- Nothing, nothing much.
Just passing through.
- Passing through?
- Yeah.
You're so white.
Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge?
Grey, actually.
It's just an undercoat.
- (Dickie) Say again?
- You know, a primer.
That's funny.
Margie likes that
'cause she's so white too.
Yes, I do, and you're not funny.
You should come and have lunch with us before you go.
- Yes, Dickie?
- Sure, anytime.
Well...

I don't remember him.
That's so funny.
(Dickie) Silvana! Hey!
I've been looking all over for you.
Where've you been hiding?
Today you're looking for me.
- And the rest of the week?
- You're always working.
- (Dickie) Come on. Get on.
- With the American girl?
- Huh? Hold on to me.
- I hate you.
- (Dickie) Huh?
- I hate you!
(Marge) Did you suddenly forget where I lived?
I know. I'm late. I'm a swine.
- It's 4:00.
- I just woke up.
- Ohh.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You just woke up.
- Fausto and I took the boat out.
We were fishing, and then it was dawn...
- We caught absolutely nothing.
- Mmm, yes, well.
We ate everything without you.
- We?
- Yes.
- Tom Ripley's here.
- Who?
- Tom. Hello.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Thought you'd disappeared.
We were gonna send out a search party.
No, still here.
Tom was telling me about his journey over.
Made me laugh so hard
I almost got a nosebleed.
- Is that good?
- (Whispers) Shut up.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm despicable. But I love you.
- Do you love me? Do you love me?
- I'm intruding.
Can you mix a martini?
- Sure.
- (Sighs) I'll do it.
- Oh.
- I make a fabulous martini.
(Giggles)
Everybody should have one talent.
What's yours?
Forging signatures, telling lies, impersonating practically anybody.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent.
Okay, do an impression.
- Now?
- Yeah.
(As Herbert Greenleaf)
The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
- What?
- Oh, I like to sail.
Believe me, I love to sail.
- Instead, I make boats.
- Stop!
- Other people sail them.
- It's too much!
You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up.
Oh, yes, jazz.
Oh, jazz. Let's face it.
It's just, uh...
It's just insolent noise.
I feel like he's here.
Horrible, like the old bastard's here right now.
- Good.
- That's brilliant.
Brilliant!
How do you know him?
Oh, I met him in New York.
Marge! Marge, this is scary.
You've got to hear this. Meet my father,
Herbert Richard Greenleaf I.
Pleasure to meet you.
Dickie's made a fine catch.
- Uncanny!
- I know Emily thinks so.
- I don't get it.
- It's uncanny.
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, and, uh, bringing him back?
- What?
- I'd pay you.
If you would go to Italy, persuade my son to come home,
I'd pay you a thousand dollars.
(Dickie) 'I'm never going back.'
To actually hire somebody to come all the way here, to drag me back home...
Got to be a little insane, hasn't he?
- Ciao, Fausto.
- Oh, Dickie!
(Chat in Italian)
- This is Tom.
- Ciao, Tom.
- I'm never going back.
- No, I think...
Your mother, her illness, I think...
It's got nothing to do with my mother.
She's had leukem...
This is what makes me boil about him.
He wants me back. He wants me back.
- It's got nothing to do with my mother.
- Look, I don't know...
Go back. Go back to New York.
Or call him, if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard.
- Hi, Tom.
- Hi.
Marge! Tom's saying goodbye.
Oh, I'll come down.
So, uh, did you speak to my father?
Oh, you were right... about the telephones.
- I told you.
- No lines. There's some problem.
(Dickie) That's Italy.
Tom. You're off?
What are your plans?
Oh, back, I suppose, as slow as I can. Oh!
This bag!
Hey... you like jazz.
I love jazz.
Oh! This is the best.
Baker, Rollins.
Marge says she likes jazz, but she thinks Glenn Miller's jazz.
- I never said that!
- Bird, that's jazz.
Bird? Ask me the name of my sailboat.
I don't know.
What's the name of your sailboat?
Look! Look! "Bird"!
(Marge) Which is ridiculous.
Boats are female.
Everyone knows. you can't call a boat after a man.
- He's not a man. He's a god.
- Okay, we're going to Naples.
There's a club...
It's not a club, it's a cellar.
- It's vile.
- You don't have to come. It's great.
It's great. You're gonna love it.
(♪ Music over dialogue)
How are you?
Oh!
(Singing in Italian)
That'd be cool. Bring him up.
(Italian)
...Tom Ripley!
Come on! Get on up here!
(Italian)
I'll tell you when to join the chorus.
Come on.
Okay, together!
(Dickie) 'I bumped into an old friend from Princeton.
- 'A fellow called Tom Ripley.'
- (Typewriter clacking)
'He says he's going to haunt me until I agree
'to go back to New York with him.'
Afternoon.
What time is it?
- Oh, God.
- "Go back to New York with him.
- "Here..."
- You always type your letters?
- That should be two T's.
- I can't write, and I can't spell.
It's the privilege of a first-class education.
Your room's upstairs at the back.
I think Ermalinda made up the bed.
- Ermalinda!
- Si?
(Both speak Italian)
- This is so good of you.
- Don't say it again.
Now that you're a double agent and we're going to string my dad along, what if we were to buy a car with your expense money?
- Okay.
- Great.
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello.
Marge, Marge, what do you think?
Little Cinquecento with my dad's money?
Oh, please, Dickie.
You can't even drive a car.
- (Tom) You can't even drive.
- What we need urgently is an icebox.
Agree with me, and I'll be your friend for life.
- I absolutely agree with Marge.
- Hmm.
Icebox. Icebox.
(Bell tolling)
(Marge) So, what, is he gonna move in with you?
It'll just be for a little while.
He can be... He makes me laugh.
- (Marge) Okay, darling.
- Promise you'd say?
- No, I like him.
- Marge, you like everybody.
(Marge) Don't like you. Ha-ha!
Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
(Ripley mimics Marge) I like him.
(Mimics Dickie)
Marge, you like everybody.
(Mimics Marge) No, I like him.
(Mimics Dickie)
Marge, you like everybody.
(Dickie) Now you'll find out why
Marge always shows up for breakfast.
It's not love, it's my coffee machine!
(Marge) Ever since Ermalinda showed him how to make his own espresso, he feels like quite the grown-up.
(Dickie) I bought the coffee machine.
(Marge) Oh, darling, is that for me?
This is for Tom, because he didn't complain.
(Tom) That ring is superb.
Oh, Tom, I love you. See?
Ooh! I had to promise, capital "P", never to take it off.
- Otherwise, I'd give it to you.
- Isn't it great? I found it in Naples.
I had to bargain for it for about two weeks.
I hope it wasn't cheap, Marge.
- Oh, it was.
- Ha-ha(!)
I have to get a birthday present for
Frances, so perhaps you could help me.
- Who's Frances?
- My fiancée.
Ahem! Engaged?
You're a dark horse, Ripley.
- Who is she?
- Your parents met her.
Oh, God.
Oh, I can just imagine.
"If only Dickie would settle down.
"Doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild?"
Oh, God. Never. Never.
I swear on your ring, Marge,
I'm never going back.
(Tom) Say when to pull.
(Dickie) Pull now. Pull.
It's not pulling.
I'm doing it wrong.
- Better now, huh?
- Okay, okay, okay.
We'll make a sailor of you yet!
You're doing really well.
- All right, bar's open.
- Yes, please.
- Hey, can we sail to Venice?
- Sure. I love Venice.
"See Venice and die."
Isn't that right? Or is it Rome?
- Is it Rome?
- I have to see Venice.
You do something and die, don't you?
Okay. Venice is on the list.
And Rome.
Do you ski?
Ah, no, no. Don't tell me.
You're a lost cause.
That's the next thing to deal with.
Christmas, we're planning a skiing trip to Cortina.
Excellent skiing. Excellent.
Marge. Margie.
Unbelievable, Tom can't ski either.
- We'll have to teach him that too.
- Thank you.
Such little class, Marge.
Does this guy know anything?
It's a good thing we're not getting married soon.
We'd have to invite Tom on our honeymoon.
(Marge) 'Oh, I hated New York.
That whole Park Avenue crowd.
'So I fled to Paris to work on my book.'
And I was always going to this café in Montmartre with Jean-Jacques.
And Dickie would play
"My Funny Valentine".
It was only later that I found out he only knows about six songs.
Anyway, I looked forward to seeing him, I suppose.
(Speaks Italian)
(Speaking Italian)
Hey, hey, Signor Greenleaf!
If you're not at my place by 7.00,
Tom and I are running off together.

So, what did you actually do in New York?
Played piano in a few places,
I told you.
Well, that's one job.
You told me a lot ofjobs.
Few places. That's a few jobs.
The mysterious Mr Ripley.
Marge and I spent hours speculating.
Anyway, I don't even want to think about New York.
Are you ready?
- Cold beer. Thank you, Dad.
- Okay.
Copy out from here.
- You bring this with you to Europe?
- You gonna write something?
I love the fact that you brought
Shakespeare with you but no clothes.
Ermalinda says you wash out the same shirt every night. Is that true?
No. I have more than one shirt.
She can do that for you.
Anyway, just wear some of my stuff.
Wear anything you want.
Most of it's ancient.
Now your signature.
Not Dickie. Your signature.
Without the glasses, you're not even ugly.
I don't need them because I never read.
- How do I look?
- Like Clark Kent.
- Now Superman.
- Superman.
- Okay.
- I know. It's like a kid's.
(Ripley) See this, the "S" and the "T"?
Fine, vulnerable.
That's pain. That's secret pain.
Well, that must be a very deep secret,
'cause I don't know about it.
(Ripley) There's nothing more naked than your handwriting.
See how nothing's quite touching the line?
- That's vanity.
- Well, we certainly know that's true.
(Dickie) Do you have any brothers?
(Ripley) No.
No brothers, no sisters.
Me neither.
Nor does Marge.
All only children.
What does that mean?
Means we've never shared a bath.
And I'm cold. Can I get in?
No.
I didn't mean with you in it.
(Dickie) Okay.
Get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
It is me. It's an old picture.
Every time!
"Is it you? It doesn't look like you."
God!
Letters.
Greenleaf and for Ripley.
Ooh, Fran. "I miss you.
When are you coming home?
"Stop telling me what an incredible time you're having.
- "How much you love Dickie."
- Whoo!
"And Marge and Mongibello."
And this one, I think, is from your father.
(Dickie vocalizing jazz)
- Let me see it. What does he say?
- He's getting impatient.
He wants me to reassure him you're going to be home by Thanksgiving.
You've got to get a new jacket.
Really.
You must be sick of wearing the same clothes.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
I love how responsible you are.
My dad should make you chief accountant or something.
Or when I take over, which is never, I will.
Okay. When you take over, which is never, I'll accept.
Let me buy you a jacket. When we get to Rome, there's a great place...

Buon giorno. Nice sweater.
Where do we get a carrozza for the Forum?
- Can we just hire any of them?
- Relax.
Relax!
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Most important is where to eat.
I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Freddie?
Freddie. Freddie Miles.
Freddie's organising the Cortina skiing trip.
Oh.
Oh, here he is.
(Tyres screech)
- Frederico!
- Come stai?
- Bene!
- Ciao, bello! Come stai?
Oh, God, don't you want to fuck every woman you see just once?
- Only once?
- Absolutely. Once. Ciao.
- Tom Ripley, Freddie Miles.
- Tom.
I mean, hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying.
- You look gorgeous.
- As always.
So... mangiare.
Si. I got us a table outside at Fabrizio's. Tommy.
Outstanding. I tell you,
I'm so cabin-crazy with Mongi.
I know. I was there.
(♪ Jazz playing)
Look, Tom, we gotta go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's.
The best thing is, if you want to be a tourist, grab a cab now, and I'll meet you at the railway station.
What club?
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd.
Come if you want, but I thought you wanted to go sightseeing.
I do, and then maybe get the jacket and what have you.
Dick! You gotta hear this!
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back.
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Ciao. Have fun, okay?

It's marvellous.
I'm fine.
(Dickie and Freddie shouting)
Are you okay?
Sure.
The thing with Dickie...
It's like the sun shines on you, and it's glorious.
And then he forgets you and it's very, very cold.
So I'm learning.
When you have his attention, you feel like you're the only person in the world.
That's why everybody loves him.
It's always the same. Whenever someone new comes into his life...
Freddie, Fausto,
Peter Smith-Kingsley.
He's wonderful. Have you met him?
Especially you.
And that's just the boys.
Come and get him! Come and get him!
Tell me, why is it that when men play, they always play at killing each other?
(Dickie) He's drowning me!
He's drowning me!
- I'm sorry about Cortina, by the way.
- What about Cortina?
Didn't... Didn't Dick say?
He spoke to Freddie and... apparently it's not going to work out.
It's because everyone else can ski and it affects where you stay and...
(Dickie) Come on, Freddie.
At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
- The whole town comes out...
- I don't think so.
I have my own Madonna back in Rome.
Why don't you come back with me?
A lot of ladies. Ooh!
(Sniggers)
- Oh, God.
- You want to take over?
Yeah, sure.
Just point her at Capri.
Avoid the rocks.
Where are you going?

Loucura de assassinar o homem amado. Sofrimento. As memórias. O retorno. A não sentido. Enlouquecer. Aquilo que não cessa de não se escrever. Imaginário. Imagem terrível. Seu corpo, seu sangue, seu corpo gelado. Nunca mais. Nunca mais.

# Little women
I wanted to hurt you. 
I burnt your writings. 
I've got my hair cut and sold it. 
Brother. Affection. Taking care of the family. It's the distance for me. I have gone away and I never went back. I'm always walking. 
Reason to leave. Further and further. 
It's hard. 
I miss another life. 
One where I stayed. 
Sibling rivalry. Love. Intimacy. Child memories. Early years. My brother. My dear brother. 
Don't go quietly. Please fight. Until the end. Fight. 
Don't let go. 
I want a family, a husband. I'm willing to work and struggle but I want to do with him. I'm willing to struggle. I'm willing to struggle. I'll do it. 
Can't believe childhood is over. 
I can't believe all the years. 
I'm almost 30. 
I have lived so much already. 
And there's so much ahead. 
Years and years. Memories. And people. And everything. In this little forgetful head. 
So many emotions. 
Sometimes I just can't bear it. 
I need to cry. 
I need to cry. 
It's overflowing. 
Leaves falling. Trees and trees. And time. 
You just go. 
It doesn't stop. 
Time. Time. 
It was going to end one day or another. 
Here it is. 
There it goes. 
How to make it stay. 
Right now.
This moment. 
Don't go. 
Don't go. 
Don't stop writing. 
Don't. 
Angry and restless. 
Bored and restless.
Restless and obsessive.
It's my symptom. 
I'm always walking, scheming. Planning. Strategizing. 
Always feeling. 
Scheming. And feeling.
Restless. 
Hours and hours. The hours after. 
Plan. Big plans. Big money. 
Don't stop.
Or stop and cry. 
Cry and feel. 
And feel the sun burn. 
The energy. Life. 
Life. 
Green. Air. 
Life. 
Cry. On the beach. Wake up with the sunrise. On the beach. You beauty. You gentle. You're funny. 
Oh beach. 
Oh beautiful boy. 
Why do you kiss with so much tender. 
I can't forget it. 
Stop smiling. No kiss and smile. No. 
I can't change how I feel. 
I ruined our friendship with my temper. Just as I ruin everything. 
It's not an event. 
It's a process. 
Care to be loved is not the same as loving.
Sick of pressure to love but so lonely. 
Didn't want to have to love, to marry. But so lonely. 
Not bend, but so lonely. 
Turn him down and run away. 
I thought it was to get better. 
It was never for improvement. 
It was a a symptom. 
It is still. 
A moving. 
I thought it was my mother. 
It was the books. 
Those books. 
I just chose to keep moving. 
There's love. 
I chose to keep moving. 
I could stay and love. 
I could stay right here. 
With my cat and my man. 
I could. 
It would be a good life. 
It just seems like I already made up my mind. 
And I'm gonna leave another boy behind. 
And will feel so lonely over there. 
But this is the last time. 
The last time. 
The last city. 
The last country. 
I'll settle and build my family. 
I'll live bored and quiet. 
It's the last time. 
Intimacy. 
Time and intimacy. 
Is this wierd? 
What do I say? 
Who have I become? 
What is this? 
What have you been doing all these years? 
How is life? 
Those questions hurt. 
It hurts so bad. 
Who am I? 
Who am I? 
What have I become?
How have I changed? 
What is my language? 
Who am I? 
Who? 
I don't know. 
I don't know. 
We would've killed each other. 
What would've happened? 
What? 
I'd like to see those scenes.
Yes, please. 
To refuse love when one needs it so bad. 
To walk away from it when one dreams so much of it. 
It hurts so bad. 
I hate being faithful to me. To me. To my plans and not to my feelings. 
I swear to god. 
If it is foul. 
If it is empty. 
If it too fast and I'm miserable. 
If i can't love again. 
I will. 
I know I will. 
And right after 30 I'll have my family. 
I promise. 
It's the last trip. 
The last house. 
The last moving out. 
I'll settle. 
I'm selfish. 
How is it gonna benefit me? 
What do I get of it? 
I'm always scheming, always doubting, always with second thinking, background. The engines turning. What is it? What does it mean? What are the intentions? The desires? Needs? 
It's not nothing. 
It's always something.

# The boys in the band ✔️
You think it's just nifty how I've always flitted from Beverly Hills to Rome to Acapulco to Amsterdam, picking up a lot of one-night stands, a lot of custom-made duds along the trail?
I'm here to tell you the only place in all those miles, the only place that I've ever been happy was on the goddamn plane.
Run, charge.
Run, buy, borrow, make, spend.
Run, squander, beg.
Run, run, run. Waste, waste…
Waste.
And why?
Finis. Applause.
- Hey.
- Don't. You don't have to.
Hey, come on.
Oh, there's nothing quite as good as feeling sorry for yourself, is there?
Nothing.
Okay.
I adore cheap sentiment.
- You're right, Harold.
Not only can he not talk intelligently about art, he can't even follow from one sentence to the next.
But he's beautiful.
He has unnatural natural beauty.
- Not that that means anything.
- It doesn't mean everything.
Keep telling yourself that as your hair drops out in handfuls.
Not that it's not natural for one's hair to recede as one reaches seniority.
You know, faggots are worse than women about their age.
They think their lives are over at 30.
Physical beauty is not that goddamned important.
Well, of course it's not. How could it be?
It's only in the eye of the beholder.
And it's only skin-deep.
Don't forget about that one.
Oh, no,
I haven't forgotten that one at all.
It's only skin-deep, and it's transitory, too.
It's terribly transitory.
I mean, how long does it last?
30 or 40 or 50 years at the most?
Yes, it's too bad about this poor boy's face.
It's tragic.
He's absolutely cursed.
And how could his beauty ever compare with my soul?
And although I have never seen my soul,
I understand from my mother's rabbi that it's a knockout.
I, however, cannot seem to locate it for a gander, and if I could,
I would sell it in a flash for some skin-deep, transitory, meaningless beauty.
Forgive him, Father, for he know not what he do.
Oh, Michael, you kill me.
You don't know which side of the fence you're on.
If somebody says something pro-religion, you're against them.
If somebody denies God, you're against them.
One might say you have a problem in this area.
You can't live with it, you can't live without it.
- Hot stuff coming through!
- Hey!
You know what? One could murder you with very little effort.
You hang on to that great insurance policy called the church.
That's right, I believe in God.
And if it turns out that there really isn't one? Okay, nothing lost.
But if it turns out that there is,
I'm covered.
Harriet Hypocrite, that's who you are.
Right. I am one of those truly rotten Catholics who gets drunk, sins all night, and goes to Mass the next morning.
It depends on what you think sin is.
You're absolutely paranoid about absolutely everything.
Oh, yeah? Well, why don't you not tell me about it?
You starve yourself all day so that you can gorge yourself at one meal, and then you moan and groan about how fat you are and how ugly you are, when the truth is you're no fatter or thinner than you ever were.
Oh! Oh! And this pathological lateness, that's downright crazy.
Turning!
Standing before a bathroom mirror for hours and hours before you can walk out on the street, and looking no different after Christ knows how many applications of Christ knows how many ointments and salves and creams and masks.
I've got bad skin. What can I tell you?
Who wouldn't after they deliberately take a pair of tweezers and deliberately mutilate their pores?
There's no wonder you got holes in your face after the hack job you have done on yourself year in and year out.
King of the pig people.
Yes, you've got scars on your face, but they're not that bad.
And if you'd leave yourself alone, you wouldn't have any more than you've already awarded yourself.
You'd really like me to compliment you now, wouldn't you, for how honest you're being?
For being my best friend who will tell me what even my best friends won't tell me, you hateful sow.
And the pills!
Harold has been gathering, saving, and storing up barbiturates for the past year like a goddamn squirrel.
Hundreds of Nembutals, hundreds of Seconals.
All in preparation for, and anticipation of, the long winter of his death.
I'll tell you right now, Hallie, when the time comes, you'll never have the guts.
It's not always like it happens in plays.
Not all faggots bump themselves off at the end of the story.
What you say may be true.
Time will undoubtedly tell.
But in the meantime, you've left out one detail.
The cosmetics and astringents are paid for, the bathroom is paid for, the tweezers are paid for, and the pills… are paid for.
Truth game, play Murder
The rules are the same in both: you kill somebody.
You can think.
What you can't do is leave.
It's like watching an accident on a highway.
You can't look at it, and you can't look away.
Well, not everyone is a participant in life.
There are always those who stand on the sidelines and watch.
We all have to call on the telephone the one person we truly believe we have loved.
Now, here's how it works.
If you make the call, you get one point.
If the person you are calling answers, you get two more points.
Somebody else answers, you only get one.
And if there's no answer at all…
You're screwed.
You're screwed if you make the call.
When you get the person whom you are calling on the line, if you tell them who you are, you get two points. And then…
If you tell them that you love them, you get a bonus of five more points.
Hateful.
Therefore, you can get as many as ten points and as few as one.
You can get as few as none if you know how to work it.
Alan, Hank and Larry are lovers.
They're not roommates.
- Bedmates, lovers.
- Michael.
No man's still got a roommate when he's over 40 years old.
If they're not lovers, they're sisters.
- Hank is the one who's over 40.
- Well, you're pushing it.
Hank.
Yes, Alan. Larry and I are lovers.
But…
But you're married.
Jesus Christ.
I think you said the wrong thing.
Don't you love that quaint little idea?
If a man's married, he's automatically heterosexual.
Alan, Hank swings both ways… with a definite preference.
Now… who makes the first call?
They were laughing and making jokes.
Everybody knew that I had a crush on Dr. Delbert Botts and that I had asked him to be my friend.
What they didn't know was that I loved him, and that I would go on loving him years after they had all forgotten my funny little secret.
If I'm not the happy home-wrecker,
I'm an impossible son of a bitch to live with.
Guilt turns to hostility.
Who are you going to call, Alan? Hmm?
Can't remember anyone?
I believe this will be the final round.
Michael, aren't you gonna call anyone?
How could he? He's never loved anyone.
My God, Michael, you're a charming host.
Michael doesn't have charm, Donald.
Michael has counter-charm.
- Wait, are you going somewhere?
- Yes, excuse me.
You're going to miss the end of the game.
With any luck,
I won't be down until it's all over.
What do you suppose is going on up there, hmm, Alan?
What do you imagine that Larry and Hank are doing up there, hmm?
Whatever they're doing, they aren't hurting anyone.
And they're minding their own business.
Yeah, and you mind yours, Harold.
I'm warning you.
Are you, now?
Are you warning me?
Me?
I'm Harold.
I'm the one person you don't warn, Michael, because you and I are a match.
And we tread very softly with each other because we both play each other's game too well.
I know this game you're playing.
I know it very well, and I play it very well.
You play it very well, too, but you know what?
I'm the only one who's better at it than you are.
I can beat you at it, so don't push me.
I'm warning you.
You're funny, Hallie.
You're a laugh riot. Isn't he funny, Alan?
Or as you might say, "Isn't he amusing?"
He's an amusing faggot, isn't he?
Or, as you might say, freak.
That's what you called Emory, wasn't it?
A freak, a pansy.
God, what an antiquated vocabulary you have.
I'm surprised you didn't say
"sodomite" or "pederast."
You better let me bring you up to date.
Have you ever heard the term "closet-queen"?
You know what that means?
Do you know what it means to be "in the closet"?
If you're insinuating that I'm a homosexual,
I can only say that you're mistaken.
Am I?
What about Justin Stuart?
What about Justin Stuart?
You were in love with him, that's what about him.
And that is who you are going to call.
Justin and I were very good friends.
That's all.
According to Justin, that friendship was quite passionate.
What do you mean?
I mean that you slept with him in college several times.
- That's not true.
- Several times.
One time, it's youth.
Twice is a phase, maybe.
Several times, you like it.
- It's not true.
- Yes, it is!
Because Justin Stuart is a homosexual!
He comes to New York on occasion, and he calls me.
I've taken him to parties.
Larry had him once, and he has told me all about you.
Then he told you a lie.
You were obsessed with Justin.
That is all you talked about morning, noon and night.
You started doing it about Hank upstairs tonight.
"What an attractive fella he is."
All that transparent crap.
- I said he was attractive. That's all.
- How many times do you have to say it?
How many times did you have to say it about Justin?
What a good tennis player he was, what a good dancer he was, what a good body he had, how bright he was, how amusing he was, how-how the girls were all mad for him, what close friends you were.
We were very close, very good friends.
That's all.
It was obvious.
And when you did it around Fran, it was downright embarrassing.
- Even she must have her doubts about you.
- Justin lied.
If he told you that, he lied.
He'd say anything about me now to get even.
He could never get over the fact that I dropped him.
You ended the friendship, Alan, because you couldn't face the truth about yourself.
You could go on sleeping with Justin as long as he lied to himself and you lied to yourself.
And you both dated girls and you labeled yourselves men and you called yourselves
"just fond friends," but Justin finally had to be honest, and you couldn't take it.
- You couldn't take it, and so…
- No.
…you destroyed the friendship and your friend along with it.
- No.
- Oh, yes.
Justin never understood what he had done wrong to make you drop him.
- He blamed himself.
- No.
He did, until he eventually found out who he was.
- And what he was.
- No!
But to this day, he still remembers the treatment.
- Scars he got from you.
- No.
You pick up this phone, and you call Justin.
No.
I want you to call him and apologize.
You tell him what you should have told him many years ago.
- He lied. Not a word of it is true!
- Call him!
All right, then I'll dial.
You're so helpful.
Give it to me.
Hello?
One point.
It's Alan.
Two points.
- Yes. Yes, it's me.
- Is that Justin?
You sound surprised.
I should hope to think so, after all this time.
Two more points.
I'm in New York.
Yes, I…
I won't explain now, I just…
Called to tell you…
That I love you. God damn it, I love you.
I love you.
You get the goddamn bonus.
Ten points total. Jackpot!
- I love you, and I beg you to forgive me.
- Give me that. Give me that!
Justin, did you hear what that son of a bitch said?
Fran.
No, of course I knew it was you.
How are you?
Yes.
Yes, he told me everything.
No, now, don't thank me.
Please. Please, don't thank me.
I'll put him back on.
My love to the kids.
Darling, I'll take the first plane I can get.
Yes, I'm sorry, too.
I love you very much.
Thank you, Michael.
Now, it is my turn.
And ready or not, Michael, here goes.
You are a sad… and pathetic man.
You're a homosexual, and you don't want to be.
But there is nothing you can do to change it.
Not all your prayers to your God, not all the analysis you can buy in all the years you have yet to live.
We may very well one day be able to know what it is to live a heterosexual life if you want it desperately enough, if you pursue it with the fervor with which you annihilate.
But you will always be homosexual as well.
Always, Michael.
Always.
Until the day you die.
If we could just…
Oh. If we could just learn not to hate ourselves…
Quite so very much.
# Dead poets society
- Poetry is what we live for
Keep ripping, gentlemen.
This is a battle, a war.
And the casualties could be your hearts and souls.
Thank you, Mr. Dalton.
Armies of academics going forward measuring poetry.
No. We'll not have that here.
No more of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard.
Now, in my class, you will learn to think for yourselves again.
You will learn to savor words and language.
No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world.
Now, I see that look in Mr. Pitts' eye, like 19th-century literature has nothing to do with going to business school or medical school.
Right? Maybe.
Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him, thinking,
"Yes, we should simply study our Mr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter and go quietly about the business of achieving other ambitions."
I have a little secret for you. Huddle up.
Huddle up.
We don't read and write poetry because it's cute.
We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race.
And the human race is filled with passion.
And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits, and necessary to sustain life.
But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.
- Todd's poem
The most beautiful poetry can be about simple things like a cat, or a flower, or rain.
You see, poetry can come from anything with the stuff of revelation in it.
Just don't let your poems be ordinary.
Now, who's next?
Mr. Anderson,
I see you sitting there in agony.
Come on, Todd, step up.
Let's put you out of your misery.
I didn't do it. I didn't write a poem.
Mr. Anderson thinks that everything inside of him is worthless and embarrassing.
Isn't that right, Todd?
Isn't that your worst fear?
Well, I think you're wrong.
I think you have something inside of you that is worth a great deal.
"I sound my barbaric yawk "over the rooftops of the world." W.W., Uncle Walt again.
Now, for those of you who don't know, a yawp is a loud cry or yell.
Now, Todd, I would like you to give us a demonstration of a barbaric yawp.
Come on, you can't yawp sitting down.
Let's go. Come on, up.
Gotta get in yawping stance.
- A yawp.
- No, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp.
Yeah, yeah, right.
- Yawp.
- Come on, louder.
- Yawp.
- Oh, that's a mouse.
- Come on, louder.
- Yawp.
- God, boy, yell like a man.
- Yawp!
There it is. You see, you have a barbarian in you after all.
Now, you don't get away that easy.
There's a picture of Uncle Walt up there.
What does he remind you of?
Don't think, answer. Go on.
- A madman.
- What kind of madman?
- Don't think about it, answer again.
- A crazy madman.
You can do better.
Free up your mind, use your imagination.
Say the first thing that pops into your head, even if it's gibberish.
A sweaty-toothed madman.
Good God, boy, there's a poet in you after all.
There, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, close them.
Now describe what you see.
- I close my eyes.
- Yes?
- And this image floats beside me.
- A sweaty-toothed madman.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Oh, that's excellent. Now give him action.
Make him do something.
- His hands reach out and choke me.
- That's it. Wonderful, wonderful.
- And all the time he's mumbling.
- What's he mumbling?
Mumbling truth. Truth, like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
Forget them, forget them.
Stay with the blanket.
Tell me about that blanket.
You can push it, stretch it, it'll never be enough.
You kick at it, beat it, it'll never cover any of us.
From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying, it'll just cover your face as you wail and cry and scream.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Don't you forget this.
- O captain
Read.
"Understanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D."
To fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, rhyme and figures of speech, then ask two questions.
One: How artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered?
And two:
How important is that objective?
Question one rates the poem's perfection.
Question two rates its importance.
And once these questions have been answered, determining the poem's greatness becomes a relatively simple matter.
"If the poem's score for perfection is plotted on the horizontal of a graph..."
- Mr. Keating, they made everybody sign it.
- Quiet.
You gotta believe me, it's true.
- I do believe you, Todd.
- Leave, Mr. Keating.
- But it wasn't his fault.
- Sit down.
One more outburst from you or anyone else, and you're out of this school.
Leave, Mr. Keating.
I said leave, Mr. Keating.
O Captain! My Captain!
Sit down, Mr. Anderson.
Do you hear me? Sit down.
Sit down.
This is your final warning, Anderson.
How dare you?
Do you hear me?
O Captain! My Captain!
Mr. Overstreet, I warn you. Sit down.
Sit down.
Sit down. All of you.
I want you seated. Sit down.
Leave, Mr. Keating.
All of you, down. I want you seated.
Do you hear me?
Sit down.
Thank you, boys.
Thank you.
# A home at the end of the world
Are you freaked out?
No.
A little.
It's just love, man.
It's nothing to fear.
We need to find you a woman.
You're 9.
You've been a virgin too long.
Mm-hmm?
We'll find you a woman in the sixth grade, somebody with a little experience.
Okay.
[]
Come here.
I got a surprise for you.
It's windowpane.
For clarity of vision.
Cin-cin.
[]
She's my favorite.
Yeah, she's a beauty.
How you feeling?
Okay.
Tell me when you feel more than okay.
I will.
Come on.
I got something to show you.
It's a good place to come when things get a little... tilty back home.
My son... this is your inheritance.
[WIND WHISTLING]
Whoa.
There's nothing to be afraid of in this whole pretty world, Bobby.
I'm here.
Wow.
All's well, yes?
This is where we live.
I can see our house from here!
Come on down, man.
I can see the school too!
Come on.
I can see tomorrow from here!
How's it look?
Pretty.
Big, pretty world, man.
Everything can happen.
Bobby...
What do you like about me?
What?
Do you...
Do you like me?
I like you.
Of course I like you.
I mean, could you...
You know, do you have...
God, I can't believe you're gonna make me say it.
Do you think I'm attractive?
Oh. I, uh...
That's what I thought you were gonna ask.
And, yes, I...
Absolutely, I do.
Good.
That's good.
Well... there's just no smooth or sophisticated way to do this, is there?
Clare...
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
No, listen.
You talk too much, darling, and if you don't shut up,
I will come to my senses and realize how utterly stupid and self-destructive this is.
I have to tell you,
I've never... you know, done this before.
Pardon me?
I've never... you know...
Never?
No.
Does that freak you out?
No.
I mean, yes, of course it freaks me out!
Jesus Christ.
I guess maybe we should stop.
Maybe.
Because, you know...
I may not be the most, like... adept.
Oh, honey.
You think I'm upset because you might not be adept?
Is that what you think?
No.
I guess.
Okay...junior.
Mama's gonna teach you a thing or two.
Are you nervous?
Uh-huh.
Don't be.
This is the most natural thing in the world.
All right.
I do have some money left over from my grandfather, but I've stashed it away for when the baby comes.
You're having a baby?
Didn't Jonathan tell you?
It, uh...
It hasn't come up.
I didn't know you two were, um--
Lovers? We're not.
Most parents aren't lovers.
Mine weren't.
I know this must sound a little...
A little what, darling?
A little free?
A little great?
A little like insisting on our own happiness, even if it's not what people ordinarily do?
Well...
Babies.
I mean, hey, let's have a dozen.
Bobby, I'm starting to feel a little extra.
You're essential, man.
Hey. Let's dance.
You can't dance to opera.
You can dance to anything.
What are you doing?
A little kiss between brothers.
Nothing wrong with that.
Bobby?
If you want my family so badly,
I hereby bequeath them to you.
No. No, better yet,
I hereby bequeath you my whole, entire life.
Be me.
I hereby dub you
Jonathan Glover.
Tomorrow, when they cremate my father's body, you can be the son, and I'll be the best friend.
You can come back from the service and you can console my mother.
Jonathan, stop it.
Stop it.
You're better at it than I am.
You're better qualified.
So go, go at it.
Be their son, with my blessings.
Listen to me, you little shit.
All he's ever done is worship you, and all you've ever done is walk out on him.
Don't you dare speak to him like that, you hear me?
You don't know what you're talking about.
You don't know the first thing about worship.
Do you know?
Do you have any idea how much I...
Listen, you guys--
How much
I wanted you?
How much I loved you, you asshole?
You know?
And then, what an idiot I am, how pathetic is that?
Me in love with you.
And then Bobby comes along, and I fall in love with this one, and then I think that we...
That the three of us, maybe we could...
[SOBS]
Fuck it.
JONATHAN: Clare?
Just leave me alone and go back to the house and have a drink.
Clare!
Clare...
How could you?
Just leave without saying anything?
I couldn't be the uncle anymore.
Give me a break, okay?
Clare, hey...
Don't call me that.
What? Don't call you what? Your name?
What did you think
I would do without you,
Jonathan?
What were you thinking?
BOBBY:
Oh, Clare, come on.
I'm pregnant, you fuckers!
What?
Are-- Are you sure?
I'm completely sure.
You wanted this.
Didn't you?
God help me.
Clare... Oh, man.
You think?
Yes.
What's the kid gonna call Bobby and me?
Oh, I never thought of that.
"Daddy," I suppose.
Like, "Daddy One" and "Daddy Two?"
Bobby, what if I... just couldn't do this?
It'll be okay.
Trust me.
You know, I think maybe
I'm not...this unusual.
I think maybe it's just my hair.
[QUIETLY]
I love your hair.
Come here.
Oh, Bobby.
Oh, mamacita!
Here you are.
Oh, look what you've done.
Our little place.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Oh, that's Ned and me.
Where did you find this?
Oh, it's lovely, all of it.
Jonathan?
Mm. Hi.
Ow.
I was so in love with you.
I was in love with you too.
But Bobby is the love of your life.
You know it's not that simple.
It's just that...
I seem to have ended up...
Come to bed.
I can't sleep.
Do you want me to get up?
No.
Go back to sleep.
Good night, crazy mama.
It'll all seem better in the morning.
Gonna miss you.
Oh, it's just a few days.
You're taking a lot of stuff.
Well, she needs a lot of stuff.
Okay, I think we're all set.
So...
Bobby...
Uh-huh?
Do you want to come with us?
I can't.
Bobby...
Do you want to come with us?
No.
Windowpane.
For clarity of vision.
If something bad happens, tell my parents
I tried to be good, but it was just too hard.
You're not freaked out about the graveyard?
I mean, don't be.
The dead are just people too.
People who wanted the same things we want.
What do we want?
I don't know, man.
I mean, our lives, right?
Man, like, this whole big, beautiful, noisy world, and everything that can happen.
Uh-oh.
All's well, little brother.
Your folks love you.
I love you.
Nothing to fear.
Listen... this will be an all right place to put my ashes too, okay?
Sure.
I mean... whatever you want.
You built us a very good home.
That's not what--
That's what you did.
That's what you did for me, you know?
It's funny, isn't it?
What?
The big, beautiful, noisy world.
Everything that can happen.
# The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie ✔️
Who opened the window?
Whoever opened the window has opened it too wide.
Six inches is perfectly adequate.
More is vulgar.
Forsooth, one should have... an innate sense of these things, of what is suitable.
For those who like that sort of thing, that is the sort of thing they like.
That is what I am for,
Mary McGregor... to provide you with interests.
Little girls, I am in the business of putting old heads on young shoulders.
All my pupils are the crème de la crème.
Give me a girl at an impressionable age... and she is mine for life.
You girls are my vocation.
If I were to receive a proposal of marriage tomorrow... from the Lord Lyon, king of arms,
I would decline it.
I am dedicated to you in my prime.
And my summer in Italy has convinced me... that I am truly in my prime.
It is possible you will hear my teaching methods decried in certain quarters... as being unsuitable for a conservative school like Marcia Blaine.
That is to say, a school dedicated to the status quo.
Can anyone define "status quo"?
Sandy?
Does it mean staying the same,
Miss Brodie?
Precisely.
Staying the same to the point of petrification.
I do not intend to devote my prime to petrification.
Prop up your books in case of intruders.
If there are intruders, we are doing our history.
But we will not do our history.
Can anyone tell me who is the greatest Italian painter?
Leonardo da Vinci, Miss Brodie.
That is incorrect, Jenny.
The answer is Giotto.
He is my favorite.
Observe, little girls,
Stanley Baldwin... who got in as prime minister and got out again ere long.
Safety does not come first.
Goodness, Truth and Beauty come first.
One's prime brings one's insight into these things.
One's prime is the moment one is born for.
You little girls must be on the alert to recognize your prime... at whatever time it may occur... and live it to the full.
There's very little for me to say, Miss Mackay... in the face of your extraordinary prejudice and hostility.
Miss Brodie, I am not asking you to say anything.
I am asking... demanding... that you put your signature, your own signature... on a letter of resignation which I have prepared for you.
I will not resign.
If you will not resign, you will force me to dismiss you.
I will not resign... and you will not dismiss me,
Miss Mackay.
You will not use the excuse of that pathetic... that humorous document to blackmail me!
Mr. Lowther, you are a witness to this.
Miss Mackay has made totally unsupported accusations against my name and yours.
If she has one authentic shred of evidence... just one, let her bring it forth!
Otherwise, if one more word of this outrageous calumny reaches my ears, I shall sue!
I shall take Miss Mackay to the public courts... and I shall sue the trustees of
Marcia Blaine, if they support her.
I will not stand quietly by and allow myself to be crucified... by a woman whose fetid frustration has overcome her judgment!
If scandal is to your taste,
Miss Mackay, I shall give you a feast!
- Miss Brodie!
- I am a teacher!
I am a teacher, first, last, always!
Do you imagine that for one instant...
I will let that be taken from me without a fight?
I have dedicated, sacrificed my life to this profession.
And I will not stand by like an inky little slacker... and watch you rob me of it and for what?
For what reason?
For jealousy!
Because I have the gift of claiming girls for my own.
It is true I am a strong influence on my girls.
I am proud of it!
I influence them to be aware of all the possibilities of life... of beauty, honor, courage.
I do not, Miss Mackay, influence them to look for slime where it does not exist!
I am going.
When my class convenes, my pupils will find me composed... and prepared to reveal to them the succession of the Stuarts.
And on Sunday, I will go to Cramond to visit Mr. Lowther.
We are accustomed, bachelor and spinster... to spend our Sundays together in sailing and walking the beaches... and in the pursuit of music.
Mr. Lowther is teaching me to play the mandolin.
Good day, Miss Mackay.
- Sandy
Sandy.
Sandy.
I believe, Sandy...
I believe I am past my prime.
I had reckoned on my prime lasting... till I was at least... 50.
Are you listening, Sandy?
I'm listening, Miss Brodie.
I have been dismissed from Marcia Blaine.
I am accused of teaching treason and sedition to my students.
I am being transported for radicalism... like Thomas Muir of Huntershill.
But if Miss Mackay and her conspirators... expect that I shall meekly lay my head on their chopping block...
- they're in for a wee surprise.
- What will you do?
As I informed Miss Mackay,
I will resort to public petition.
I have no doubt that many supporters will rally to my defense.
My students are loyal.
My girls.
Someone betrayed me, Sandy.
Someone spoke against me to the board.
Who could it have been? Who?
Are you thinking that maybe one of your girls betrayed you?
I said to Miss Mackay...
"I have the loyalty of my girls, and she said,
"Do you?"
I'll not believe it. I'll not believe it was one of my girls.
Perhaps it's true.
I thought possibly Monica.
There's very little soul...
- Monica is a loyal girl.
- I know. You all are.
Monica and Jenny.
Oh, not Jenny.
She's like a part of myself.
You, Sandy... As you see, you are exempt from all suspicion.
You have had more of my confidence than anyone.
You know more than anyone what I have sacrificed for my girls.
Teddy Lloyd was greatly in love with me, Sandy... as I think you've always known.
And I gave him up to consecrate my life to the young girls in my care... you and Monica and Jenny.
Jenny...
She and Mr. Lloyd will soon be lovers.
- I have that.
- Do you think that you are Providence?
That you can ordain love?
What?
You haven't pulled it off.
Jenny will not be
Teddy Lloyd's lover.
What are you saying, Sandy?
Jenny will not be
Teddy Lloyd's lover... and I'll not be your spy, your secret service.
My spy? What on earth are you talking about?
Do you understand at all what has happened to me?
I have been dismissed from Marcia Blaine!
Why are you standing there talking about Providence and the secret service?
What is the matter with you?
Miss Brodie, I am Teddy's lover.
What?
I am Teddy's lover.
Teddy's lover? You?
Is that so difficult to believe?
What does it matter to you which one of us it is?
It doesn't matter to Teddy.
Whatever possessed you?
You know his religion.
How could a girl with a mind of her own... have to do with a man who can't think for himself?
That doesn't seem to have bothered either of us, does it?
We were neither of us very interested in his mind.
How dare you speak to me in this manner!
I suppose I've always known that one day you were going to ask how dare I?
Why? I don't understand.
I don't seem to understand what has happened to everyone.
Where has everyone gone?
Only Mary is gone.
Mary? What has Mary to do with it?
Miss Brodie,
Mary McGregor is dead!
Are you aware of the order of importance... in which you place your anxieties?
One, you have been betrayed.
Two, who is or is not to be your proxy in Teddy Lloyd's bed... and three, Mary's death.
Miss Brodie, aren't you concerned at all with Mary's death?
I grieve for Mary.
It was because of you she went!
Because of me?
It was her brother.
The poor, unfortunate girl hadn't anyone else in the world.
She had you.
That was her misfortune.
To please you, that silly, stupid girl ran off and got herself killed!
Don't you feel responsible for that?
No.
No, I feel responsible for giving her ideals...
The ideals that sent her to Spain.
I feel responsible for teaching her that service to a cause is a privilege.
You call it a privilege to be killed?
And for nothing.
Nothing!
You really are a shallow girl, Sandy.
By the way she died,
Mary McGregor illumined her life.
- She died a heroine.
- She died a fool!
Joining her brother to fight for Franco... wasn't that just like Mary?
Her brother is fighting for the other side.
- Her brother...
- Her brother is fighting for the Republicans!
Mary was headed for the wrong army!
Oh, Mary McGregor!
"Mary McGregor".
I used to wonder why you always called Mary by her full name.
I think it was because you had such a hard time remembering who she was.
Poor, dim Mary.
I was devoted to Mary.
No, you were only attracted to Mary because she had no one else... and she was so totally suggestible.
She appealed to your vanity!
It was you who betrayed me.
I didn't betray you!
I simply put a stop to you!
Oh, I see.
No, you don't see.
You don't see that you're not good for people.
In what way?
In what way, Sandy, was I not good for you?
You are dangerous and unwholesome... and children should not be exposed to you!
How can you think it?
How can you think that I would harm you?
- But you have... You have harmed me!
- How?
You have murdered Mary!
You have assassinated me!
Oh, why must you always strike attitudes?
You really are a ridiculous woman!
What will you do... now?
Do?
I don't know.
But I am a descendant, do not forget... of Willie Brodie.
He was a man of substance...
A cabinetmaker and a designer of gibbets... a member of the town council of Edinburgh... the keeper of two mistresses who bore him five children between them.
Blood tells.
He played much dice and fighting cocks.
Eventually, he was a wanted man for having robbed the excise office.
Not that he needed the money.
He was a burglar for the sake of the danger.
He died cheerfully on a gibbet of his own devising in 1788.
That is the stuff I am made of.
I knew you would rise like a phoenix.
I'm glad I shall not have to worry about you.
No, I expect that is to be your gift, Sandy... to kill without concern.
It is you who are dangerous.
You see yourself as a conqueror, don't you, Sandy?
Kaiserian in all his beauty rare.
But you profess to be a great admirer of conquerors.
Good-bye, Miss Brodie.
Assassin!
Assassin!
# Call me by your name 
Mom?
Yeah, it's me.
Yeah, everything is fine.
I'm at the station... in Clusone.
Listen, Mom, can you...
Can you come get me, Mom?
- Oliver enjoyed the trip?
- Yeah.
I think he did.
You two had a nice friendship.
Yeah.
You're too smart not to know how rare, how special what you two had was.
Oliver was Oliver.
Because it was him.
Because it was me.
Oliver may be very intelligent but...
He was more than intelligent.
What you two had, had everything and nothing to do with intelligence.
He was good.
You're both lucky to have found each other because you, too, are good...
I think he was better than...
I think he was better than me.
I'm sure he'd say the same thing about you.
Yeah. He'd say the same thing.
It flatters you both.
And when you least expect it, nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot.
Just remember, I am here.
Right now, you may not wanna feel anything, maybe you never wanted to feel anything.
And maybe it's not to me you'd want to speak about this things but feel something you obviously did.
Look, you had a beautiful friendship.
Maybe more than a friendship.
And I envy you.
In my place, most parents would hope the whole thing goes away.
Pray their sons land on their feet, but I am not such a parent.
We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster, that we go bankrupt by the age of 30.
And have less to offer, each time we start with someone new.
But to make yourself feel nothing so as not to feel anything.
What a waste.
Have I spoken out of turn?
And I'll say one more thing, it'll clear the air.
I may have come close but I never had what you two have.
Something always held me back or stood in the way.
How you live your life is your business.
Just remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once, and before you know it, your heart's worn out.
And as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it much less wants to come near it.
Right now, there's sorrow, pain.
Don't kill it, and with it, the joy you felt.
Does Mom know?
I don't think she does.

"There were many scenes in this movie that stuck with me, most of which have probably been discussed to death here (the dad, the peach, the sheer pleasure of sitting around reading, swimming, and doing whatever you want unsupervised).
I think as an American, one of the things that stuck to my bones was how the parents reacted to their son's sexuality. I don't mean his homosexuality. I mean, sexuality as a whole. Despite most of the key characters being American, they all have a European sensibility that is very rare to see here in the US. One could argue that the movie itself could be making a social comment about open, honest European views of sex vs. moralizing, restrictive American views.
First, the parents see their son is attracted to a man, so they do things to help facilitate that attraction by giving them the idea to travel alone together. They also let Elio and Oliver have their space in the house - they aren't monitoring Elio or "checking up on him," which I found refreshing.
Second, the parents are genuinely always there for Elio in helping him discuss sexual relationships. He is able to say to his parents out loud, "I could never be that open," a vulnerable statement I have trouble imagining expressing to my parents. They simply reassure him; they don't nag or moralize him about sex. Of course, there's the scene with the father discussing his own sexual past and desires, openly and without judgment that exemplifies this behavior.
Third, the adults in the movie treat Elio respectfully with regard to his sexual encounters. For example, when Elio greets the older gay couple with Marzia and quickly gives her a kiss and a loving pat, the adults simply maturely greet her and say hello. No one says "Ohhhhhhh! You have a GIRRRLFRIENND!!!!!!!!!" In the US, I find it typical that adults make teasing comments and condescending "jokes" about "how cute it is to have a crush" to teenagers. This moralizing can make teens internalize that they are doing something wrong when they are actually doing something natural.
To see adults treat Elio respectfully and collegially, like a mature young adult for whom sex is one of many natural, positive experiences, filled me with hope, jealousy, and a strong feeling about the kind of parent I'd like to be if/when I have teenagers. It's not very common you walk out of a movie thinking, "This movie has changed or informed the way I want to live my life" but this one has for me. Last, I think we are in a particular time where we are really looking back on the 1980s with a specific nostalgia for a time when kids could just be kids, ride their bikes everywhere, have adventures, be home for dinner, then go out again and have more unsupervised adventures. Stranger Things, It, and CMBYN all are really tapping into that nostalgia, albeit in slightly different ways."
Eu amei muito a forma como os pais e os personagens trataram a questão de estar apaixonado/sexualidade. De como o filme não é sobre a violência contra a homossexualidade, brigas com os pais e o mundo para poder assumir seu amor. Os pais dele são muito sensatos e dão o espaço para que o filho possa florecer e explorar o mundo. E eles estão ali para dar suporte, conversar. Eu adoro que quando o Oliver pega o trem pra ir pra casa e o Elio tá com o coração tão partido que ele não quer ir pra casa sozinho. ele liga pra mãe ir buscá-lo, chora no carro e a mãe ao invés de iniciar um discurso gigante, ela apenas está lá. pra ele não ficar sozinho. A presença dela para consolar e dar espaço para que o filho absorva sua tristeza.
Pq os pais que são desenhados como realidade pra mim, são pais que ensinam aos filhos como é o mundo. Por isso eu gosto dessa visão de que os pais do Elio não estão ali para ensinar, mas para dar suporte. E porque eu acho fundamental vc ter alguém que vc possa estar junto quando vc estiver com o coração partido. E pq eu queria que eles fossem os meus pais. A mãe lê poesinha alemã pro filho. É simplemente uma configuração familiar muito linda. E minha mãe é uma porta de violência com quem eu nunca posso me abrir e me mostrar frágil pq ela guardaria isso e usaria pra me ferir 5 minutos depois. Como ela já fez várias e várias vezes.
Henrique: Essa mae eh uma personagem de filme construída para tocar as pessoas.
Mas reflete em mim os elementos que sinto falta na minha...
Mas isso já passou,
Eu acho complicado pq eu gostaria de fazer um trabalho melhor como pai (ser a antítese que colide com a tese (meus pais) e produz a síntese (meu filho)). Definição de dialética. Mas esse mesmo filho se desenvolveria em relação e em oposição a mim e a sociedade dele... É sempre a mesma coisa...
Henrique: Meu você realmente quer hoje deixar de fazer rolezinho com as gays para cuidar do filho que esta cansado?
Até pq hoje em dia a gente quase não faz mais rolezinho com as gays... O capitalismo é um modo de sistema voltado a preservar a estrutura familiar... Todos nós já estamos sentindo a pressão de constituir nossas próprias famílias... "The part when he called his mom asking her to pick him up had me crying...I called my mom when I said goodbye to my first love too. The last quarter of this movie felt like open-heart surgery." É difícil dividir apt com amigos por questões de espaços (até achar que os amigos ocupam um espaço que não lhes pertence). No ita era muito mais difícil se sentir sozinho pq pra substituir o ambiente familiar os militares fazem com que os alunos criem novos laços familiares entre si. Para suprir a ausência da família. Mas isso é apenas para a formação profissional. Depois disso existem casas nas vilas para famílias. De vc tivesse um marido morando junto contigo os sentimentos que vc teria seriam diferentes. É difícil suportar as pressões do mercado de trabalho ou encontrar um objetivo pra vida distante de contato afetivo. Os homens são putões enquanto estão na casa dos pais e apenas estudam. Depois podem até viver trocando de namorada, mas sempre estão namorando até que percebem que o contato afetivo precisa ser mais intenso. Suporte emocional é essencial para o sucesso profissional e a maioria dos héteros sabem disso. Hoje em dia não deve ter quase nenhuma pessoa solteira na nossa turma. A maioria deve estar caminhando para formar uma família nos próximos 4, 5 anos. O sentir que deve. A sociedade tem seus mecanismos de fazer com que o homem se assente numa família. O homem é tão necessário para a família heterossexual quanto a mulher.E eles não fazem isso por coincidência, mas sim por pressão material. A materialidade requer isso. Não é apenas argumentativo. É questão que é muito mais difícil viver fora dessa configuração dentro de um sistema cuja lógica de produção é sustentada pela família. É muito mais fácil emocionalmente para o Juci sair do país com o marido que pra mim sozinho. Com a família ele leva toda uma base emocional. E qualquer pessoa heterossexual te diria que sua instabilidade emocional no trabalho seria muito menor se vc tivesse uma família com vc. A questão de constituir família não é apenas para ter um almoço no domingo. é para dar sentido à vida e te dar base para superar as dificuldades. Os lgbts terão muito mais dificuldade de ascenção material quanto maiores forem as dificuldades de relacionamento.

CALL ME BY YOUR NAME | MY COMFORT SCENE
“Look, you had a beautiful friendship. Maybe more than a friendship. And I envy you. In my place, most parents would hope the whole thing goes away, to pray that their sons land on their feet. But I am not such a parent. In your place, if there is pain, nurse it. And if there is a flame, don't snuff it out.”
“Don't be brutal with it. We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster, that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new.  But to make yourself feel nothing so as not to feel anything - what a waste!”
“Have I spoken out of turn?”
(ELIO shakes his head.)
“Then let me say one more thing. It will clear the air. I may have come close, but I never had what you two had. Something always held me back or stood in the way. How you live your life is your business. Remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once. And before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it. Right now there's sorrow. Pain. Don't kill it and with it the joy you've felt.”
“We may never speak about this again. But I hope you'll never hold it against me that we did. I will have been a terrible father if, one day, you'd want to speak to me and felt that the door was shut, or not sufficiently open.”
