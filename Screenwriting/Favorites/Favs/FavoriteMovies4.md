-[video camera whirring]
-[Sophie] Oh. Oh.
-[Sophie sighs] What's that?
-[Calum chuckles]
-[Sophie] Oh, my God, what even is that?
-These are my moves.
[Sophie chuckles]
Dad, that's so embarrassing.
[Calum] That's not embarrassing.
[Sophie] Wait.
-What?
-I was gonna interview you.
Oh, you were, were you?
What were you gonna interview me about?
[Sophie] I don't know.
-Well…
-Well, I just turned 11, and you are 130, turning 131 in 2 days.
[chuckles] So…
When you were 11, what did you think you would be doing now?
[video camera whirs]
[moody music playing]
-[baby crying]

[music fades]
-[engine starting]
-Hiya, everyone. My name's Belinda, and I'll be your tour rep for the next week or two.
Now, I've only just transferred in from Torremolinos.
-[microphone feedback ringing]
-[speaks indistinctly]
-[loudly] From Torremolinos!
-[feedback ringing]
[crowd laughing]
[Belinda] Right. Well, I hope I'll be a good help to you here in Turkey
-all the same.
-[Calum whispers] "Hiya."
-[Belinda] We've got seven stops tonight.
-"My name's Belinda."
So, just bear with us. All right?
"And I've just come in from…
[loud whisper] …Torremolinos!"
[Sophie chuckling]
[enunciating] Torremolinos.
[softly] Torremolinos. Torremolinos…
[calling bell dinging]
[dog barking in distance]
-Hang tight, poppet, okay?
-Okay.
I'm fine.
[door opening]
[Calum] Someone's coming.
Time for bed?
No.
[lifts telephone receiver, dials]
[line ringing]
Hello?
Hi. It's, um, 501.
Yeah, that's us.
Yeah, um, I booked a room with two beds, but we've only got the one here.
Yeah, okay, well, I paid for it, and, um, it was confirmed by the travel agency.
Okay, that's all you can do?
[softly] Okay. Scooch under. There we go.
Oh, it'll have to be then.
Okay. Thanks.
Mmm, good night.
[softly] Good night. [kisses]
[objects clatter softly]

[metal clanging outside]
-[people speaking indistinctly]
-[clanging continues]
-"Digital video entertainment."
-[Calum] Don't get that wet, Soph.
-It was expensive.
-[Sophie mouthing]
[clanging continues loudly]
Sorry about the hotel.
Clive was just here, said he had a great time.
[hammering, clanging]
Everything okay at home?
What do you mean?
I mean, how are you and your mum getting along?
Yeah, okay, I guess.
Good.
I'm glad.
Why? What did she tell you?
She didn't say anything.
You just told me you weren't getting along that well last time I saw you. Remember?
Can't exactly ask you when I phone you at home.
Oh, yeah. Right.
Things have been better.
Why don't you go over and introduce yourself?
-Dad, no. They're, like, kids.
-Mmm-hmm.
Why don't you go over and introduce yourself?
Mmm. Sophie, they're, like, old.
[Calum chuckles]
[Calum] Hmm. See, if you let it rest on an object for a wee while, it gets the lighting right.
That's quite clever.
[somber music playing]
[Sophie and Calum laugh]
-You want a massive ice cream?
-Yeah, that's bigger than my head.
[Calum] That's impossible.
You have a massive head. [chuckles]
-[Sophie] Are you done?
-[chuckling] What?
-That's a bit rude.
-No, it's not. It's just a fact.
[Sophie] Your head's bigger than mine.
[Calum] I…
I would disagree with that fact.
Look at the size of it. [laughing]
Your head's bigger. See?
[Sophie squeals, speaks indistinctly]
-[indistinct conversation]
-[somber music continues]
[Calum on video] Say hello to your mum.
That's all you're gonna give her?
-[Sophie] Love you.
-[Calum] Say you miss her.
[Sophie] I miss you.
-[Calum] And what?
-[Sophie] And bye-bye.
[Calum whispers]
And your dad's being amazing.
-[normal voice] And what?
-[Sophie] And my dad's being amazing.
-[Calum] Why is your dad being amazing?
-Because he's taking so much…
[video stops]
[video camera turning off]
[dog barking in distance]
[sighs softly]
Uh-huh. Well, what did she say?
Oh. I'll do it when I'm home.
School doesn't start until Thursday, right?
Okay.
Yeah, it's good.
We're not actually at our hotel.
But ours doesn't have a phone, so…
Dad?
He's good.
Oh, my God, he's doing some weird slow-motion ninja moves.
Why is he so weird sometimes?
But, yeah, he's good.
All right. Love you. Bye.
[knocks on door]
-Mum wants to talk to you.
-What?
-Mum wants to talk to you.
-Right.
[Calum] Thanks, poppet.
Hey.
Checking up on me?
[girl 1] So, are you gonna do anything?
-[girl 2] What do you mean?
-[toilet flushing]
[girl 1] With George.
He told Seb he wanted to.
With you, I mean.
Not Seb, obviously.
Last night, on the way home, I gave Kenny…
Literally in the bushes behind the other pool.
[girl 2] Well, like, what happened?
-[girl 1] What do you mean?
-[girl 2] Did he come?
[girl 1] Yeah. I mean, obviously.
[toilet flushing]
You should wear your hair back sometimes.
You look really pretty with your hair back.
[water running]
[girl 2] Oh, my God, do you think she heard us?
[girl 1] Who cares?
She's literally, like, nine.
[girls giggle]
[tap closes]
[Calum chuckles]
That's wonderful.
[chuckles]
Yeah, I'm so happy for you.
All right. Love you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, will do.
Okay. Bye.
[hangs up phone]
Hey. [chuckles]
-[rock song playing on speakers]
-[indistinct chatter]
Do you know how to play?
It's that one to start.
I know.

-[automated voice] Game over. Round one.
-[video game trilling]
-You wanna play again?
-Right, Soph, we're up.
-[Sophie] Bye.
-Bye.
Here you go.
Right, you ready?
[indie rock song playing on speakers]
Right. There you go.
-You don't mind, do you?
-No bother.
Right. Last one for now, then, okay?
Do you want a game of doubles?
Yeah, sure.
-[boy] You've got a built-in rest there.
-[chuckles] No danger.
I'm right-handed, and I'm playing with a kid, right?
Go easy.
-You wanna break, or…
-Yeah.
[Calum] Good.
-[pool ball strikes]
-Well done.
[balls rolling]
So, what's your sister's name?
-Uh, Sophie.
-Oh, nice.
I'm her dad, though, actually.
-[boy] Oh. Sorry, mate, I just thought--
-[Calum] That's okay.
-[Calum] It's a nice hotel, eh?
-[boy] Yeah, it's all right.
We're staying in that one over the road.
-Basically a building site, so…
-[chuckles]
[ball strikes]
Olly.
Fucking hell, Sophie. Impressive.
Hey, don't say… [whispers] …"fuck."
-Oh, sorry, mate--
-That's okay.
Well done.
[balls rolling]
Right, I'm up. You watching?
[kids screaming excitedly]
[pool water splashing]
-[boy] No!
-That's it. Move it.
-[boy screams] No!
-No.
You want to ruin it again for everybody, as usual.
[boy shouts] No!
[Calum] Twist.
-[Sophie grunts]
-Nope. Keep your…
-I'm not letting you off. Go again.
-[grunts]
No, you're just pushing.
Look, you have to twist.
Like, here.
Okay? Again.
No. Okay, grab my wrists.
Okay, okay, I get it.
So, the thin part lines up to where the fingers connect, okay?
-Are you looking?
-Okay. Mmm-hmm.
And then you pull as hard as you can, like that.
-Ow!
-No, this is serious, Sophie.
Look at me. It's important you get this.
Go.
No. You're not twisting, you're just pulling.
-Okay, again. Look, grab my wrists.
-I can't twist.
Thin part lines up to where the fingers connect.
Okay? And you pull as hard as you can.
-[softly] Okay.
-This is serious, Sophie.
It's important you get this.
So that you can defend yourself.
So that if anyone ever tries to attack you, you can break free and get away.
What if someone tries to attack me some other way?
Without grabbing my wrists?
[somber music playing]
[Sophie] I think it's nice that we share the same sky.
What you mean?
Well, like, sometimes at playtime,
I look up to the sky, and if I can see the sun, then I think about the fact that we can both see the sun.
So, even though we're not actually in the same place, and we're not actually together, we kind of are in a way, you know?
Like, we're both underneath the same sky, so… we're kind of together.
One. Head under.
-[speaks indistinctly]
-Two.
Three.
Four.
Four and a half…
-Stop, stop.
-What?
-[kids shouting indistinctly, playing]
-[somber music continues]
[Sophie] Can we do that?
[Calum] Hmm?
You're too young, poppet.
[music fades]
-[shower running]
-[Sophie] Ladies and gentlemen, the marvelous, wonderful, amazing, one-armed Calum Aaron Patterson.
Getting ready to see the evening entertainment.
And…
We'll see…
[squealing] Torremolinos!
[Calum] You okay, Soph?
-[pop song playing on speakers]
-[indistinct chatter]
[Sophie] You've not mentioned Claire.
Hmm? Um…
Remember she had a boyfriend when we first met?
Yup.
I was like, "Who's that on the phone?"
You were like, "Oh, just this girl I like, but she's already going out with someone."
Yeah, well, they got back together.
Aw. I liked her.
Mmm-hmm. Me, too.
So, does that mean you're not gonna open the café?
Café?
Uh, no. Not anymore.
But… I've got this new thing going with Keith.
What is it?
Well, we're still figuring it out exactly, but we're thinking of renting a house a wee bit outside London to work from.
You'd have your own room for when you come down.
-Yes. Can I paint it yellow?
-Yellow?
Why yellow?
I like the idea of a yellow room, but Mum doesn't let me paint my room yellow.
[chuckles]
[sing-song]
You're trying to get me into trouble.
Well, can I, though?
Aye, we'll see.

[Sophie] Did it hurt?
When you fell.
-[Calum] When I broke my wrist?
-Uh-huh.
I don't know.
I don't really remember.
Um, I didn't think it was broken then.
I'd never broken anything before.
[grunts softly]
[Sophie] I've never broken anything before.
[Calum] Mmm.
-How come you and Mum say, "Love you"?
-What?
Like, on the phone.
You're not together, so why would you say it?
Well…
Think of all the people you say it to.
Like, your nana, granddad, uncle, aunties, right?
Yeah, but they're, like, family.
Well, your mother is family.
[Sophie] I remember one time
I asked Mum if she'd phoned you.
-[Calum groans softly]
-And she said that you were engaged.
Like, I didn't know why, but I thought that meant that you were getting married, like, both of youse.
Like, I didn't know if I thought that about just you or both of you, but…
[Calum grunts, winces]
Isn't that funny?
Well, I didn't know what it meant at the time.
I didn't know that it meant that you were just on the phone to somebody else.
I was kind of excited.
About us getting married?
Yeah. I was really young, though.
Like…
I don't know, like, seven.
How are you getting on with the book?
You enjoying it?
Yeah, it's a bit hard to understand, though.
[Calum] Stick with it.
I think you'll really like it.
[water dripping]
What does "municipal" mean?
[water lapping softly]
[somber music playing]
[Calum] A proper dive, Soph.
[Sophie] I told you, I can't.
-[Calum] You were diving last year.
-No, I wasn't.
[Calum] Here.
-[Sophie] Pass me my mask.
-I did.
[Sophie] What?
[Calum] Come on, Soph, stop messing around.
[Sophie] I'm not messing around.
[somber music continues]
[music fades]
[man speaking in Spanish]
I don't deserve this.
Shut up, don't be silly.
[man and woman laugh]
No, to the right.
You've already applied it there.
You know I didn't see you throw it.
[Calum] Throw what?
The mask. I know it was expensive.
That's okay, darling.
It's fine.
I'm just a little tired today, that's all.
Can you run up and grab the camera?
It's in the bag.
[sighs]
[straining]
[man] Here.
Put that on your foot, then try again.
[Calum] On my foot?
Yeah, put it on.
It's gonna be much easier.
[chuckles]
-You need help?
-Yeah, please. Thanks.
There we go.
-Thank you.
-That's a trick of the trade.
It's not a bad trade.
Nope, not at all.
Is this what you do all year round, then?
You sound like my anneanne, my mother's mum.
-Your grandma?
-Yeah.
She would prefer that I had a proper job.
-What is your shoe size?
-Uh, ten.
-Ten.
-Forty-four?
-[man] Forty-four.
-Yeah.
-I think these should fit.
-Yeah.
You know, I used to travel a lot.
One season somewhere, next season somewhere else, but now I'm here, back home.
And do you miss it?
-Travelling?
-Aye.
Not as much as I was missing home, to be honest.
And I'm going to have a baby soon.
-[chuckles] Congratulations.
-Yeah.
A few years ago, I thought I would be at least 40 before all that, but…
[Calum] I can't see myself at 40, to be honest.
Surprised I made it to 30.
[sighs]
My name is Sophie Lesley Patterson reporting live from…
I don't know the name of this boat.
Um, but, basically,
I have just went and done the most amazing thing in my whole entire life.
So, we went, like, scuba diving thing.
And there was actually, like, a sea horse, and it wrapped round my, like, whole finger.
Then when I got out, there was an… octopus, and the instructor person…
I don't know.
Like, yeah, instructor put it on… put an octopus on my head.
A real-life octopus on my head.
Yeah, but right now, Dad…
I mean, Calum Aaron Patterson… is away on some scuba diving thing, I think.
I can't remember, but…
Yeah, he doesn't actually have a diving licence,
'cause he told a porky pie.
[chuckles]
But, yeah.
He'll be fine.
Yeah.
He'll be fine, I'm sure. [chuckles]
But, yeah! Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

What's that?
What?
Uh, that's just another kind of smoking, and smoking--
Smoking causes cancer, and puts tar in your lungs, and makes your teeth all yellow, and causes your eyeballs to fall out.
[Calum chuckles softly]
We'll go somewhere else next time.
It's not that bad. When was the last time you want to see Nana?
Hmm.
Right.
Trouble.
So, watch again, okay?
-Okay. Let's see.
-Okay?
Right, that was a bad start.
When are you back at school?
-Thursday.
-Next week?
-Crazy.
-God, I thought it was a bit later.
-Who's your new teacher?
-Miss Mackel.
Aye, the one from Glasgow?
How'd you know that?
What?
She's pretty.
[laughs]
She's the pretty one from Glasgow.
She's stuck in my head.
Oh, my God, Dad, stop!
-[Calum chuckles] Okay.
-Stop.
Is she supposed to be good?
We done a crossover at the end of term.
Seems all right.

-I was gonna interview you.
Oh, you were, were you?
What were you gonna interview me about?
[Sophie] I don't know.
-Well…
-Well, I just turned 11, and you are 130, turning 131 in 2 days.
So…
When you were 11, what did you think you would be doing now?
Hello?
What did you think you would be doing now?
Come on, Soph. Turn that off now, okay?
[Sophie] Okay, it's off.
Well, I can see a red light.
[Sophie] That…
That's just because it's still on.
[Calum] Mmm-mmm.
Look, it's not even on you anymore.
It's on me.

Okay, it's not recording.
I'll just record it in my little… mind camera.

[Sophie] Right. Ready?
What did you do for your 11th birthday?
[Calum] When I was 11, nobody remembered it was my birthday.
And when I told my mum, she was so angry, she grabbed me by the ear, and made my dad drive me to the toy shop, and made me pick something to buy.
[Sophie] That's a bit, um, deep.
[Calum] It was okay.
-[Sophie] What did you pick?
-[chuckles softly]
I chose a toy phone.
It was red.
-[Sophie] Good choice.

It's all in the past for me, that's all.
And there's this feeling, once you leave where you're from, like, where you grew up, that, um, you don't… totally belong there again.
Not really.
But Edinburgh was never…
I never felt like
I really did belong there.
I do. It's home.
That's good.
I'm glad you feel that way.
But you never know where you'll end up, though, eh?
You can live wherever you want to live.
And… be whoever you want to be.
You have time.

Water polo?

Of course I did. We've done it every holiday since I was, like, five.
Maybe you're a little old for it now, Soph.

Those girls were, like, 50.
Okay, let it go.

Sophie, come on, let's get up.
It's time to go.
[somber music continues]
Careful with those.
A man died not paying attention to how to put those on properly.
The lug went right up his nose and punctured his brain.
-That's not true.
-It is.
Happy birthday, Dad.
Thanks, darling.
[Calum] Okay.
[laughing] You're copying me?
[Sophie laughs]
All right, smartarse.
Attention!
[Sophie] Oh, what's this we're doing?
[Calum] Yeah, I tricked you.
[Calum chuckles]
[Calum exhaling deeply]
-[Sophie] I'm still copying, you know?
-I know.
[Sophie] Exactly.
[Calum] And now copy this.

If it's good enough for Cleopatra…
It's kind of amazing how Cleopatra was, like, here.
Like, right here.
Yeah.
Before she was…
-By a snake.
-[chuckles]
Well, I mean, it was kind of suicide.
It wasn't for sure there was a snake.
Nobody ever found a snake, so…
-It might've just been a needle.
-How do you know that?
We learnt about Egypt last term.
What happened to your shoulder?
I don't really know.
I'm sorry I passed out on your bed.
It's fine.
I didn't have a key, though.
How'd you get in?
Reception.
[clears throat, hesitates]
I'm so sorry, Soph. Yesterday was…
It's fine. It's no big deal.
No, it is a big deal.
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry, okay?
-Thank you.
-[chuckles]
-You've got none on your arms.
-Uh… I did.
No, you don't.
Now you do.
Let's see your back.
-My back?
-Yup.
Right, I need to get a big clump for this big back.

-[Calum] Oh!

[Calum] Did you have fun last night?
[Sophie] Yeah.
This boy, Michael…
I met him on the motorbike game.
Yeah.
We… We kissed last night.
He kissed me, and then we kissed.
[Calum] He's your age, though?
[Sophie] Yeah.
[Calum] Well, that's okay, right?
Peck on the cheek?
[Sophie] Well…
-[chuckles shyly] Yeah, not exactly.
-[chuckles] Okay.
[Calum] I want you to know that you can talk to me about anything.
As you get older, you know.
Whatever parties you go to… boys you meet, drugs you take.
-[Sophie] Dad!
-No, I'm serious, Soph.
I've done it all. You can, too.
I just want you to promise me you'll talk to me about it, okay?
[Sophie] Okay.
But I'm never gonna do any of that anyway.
[Calum] That's okay, too.
But if you do, remember, okay?

I'm not gonna run off to Mexico or any—

And if I find out you had anything to do with this,
I'm gonna burn this place to the fucking ground.

You let them take the truck?

What the fuck, Melissa?
I'm sorry I wasn't guarding the truck while you left me here alone during lunch!
Where are you going now?
I got to get it back!
Robert, I need to talk to you.
Yeah, not now.
I got stuff going on.
It's about Loretta.
Oh, yeah, where the fuck is she?
Umm, there was a situation at the lake.
Okay.
She rented a boat.

Honestly, what's wrong with you?
You're gonna turn down a full scholarship?
Look, you really don't understand.
What is it that I don't understand?
You're wasting a huge opportunity!
Okay, I don't need your help, okay?
Just stay out of my life!
[door shuts]
[zips backpack]
[printer chimes]
[door slams]
Woah, what the fuck?
My mom found out, and she took the car.
Oh.
So what are you gonna do?
Well, ummm, can you maybe drive me up there?
No, I gotta finish the job at the gym.
Wha-what?
If I drive there, it'll take up my whole day.
Well, tell Sam you'll do it tomorrow.
He'll get someone else if I don't do it today.
Okay, let me borrow your truck then.
Nope, I gotta use it for the job.
Look hey, I'll take you tomorrow.
Hmmm? How 'bout that?
No, I gotta go now before my mom finds out
I lied about the scholarship.
[crunches cereal]
Hey, where you goin'?
[door slams]
Hey, wait.
I have an idea.
Get in.
[engine starts]
[impact drill revving]
Oh, look who it is.
How you been, man?
Where the hell you been?
We've been waiting for...like 10 hours.
- Russ is out, so I'm handling everything.
What do you need?
She just needs a car for just like a day or two.
(Ricky)
These have been here the longest.
Nobody's gonna care if one disappears for a couple of days.
How much?
Three hundred a day.
Oh, come on you're shitting me, right?
It'd be one thing if you were driving, but I don't think Robert's gonna be too happy when he finds—
I can get the money.
Okay, then.
Uh, you can just drop me off here.
We have to hurry, okay?
Shit.
Let's go.
Did you get it?
Uh, maybe we can convince him some other way, like give him collateral or something like that?
What? No, he's not the kind of guy that makes deals or anything like that.
We have to do something, okay?
Look. I'll take you tomorrow.
I promise.
Okay?
You know what?
Pull over.
Pull over!
What are you do— what are you doing?
Come on.
Hey.
Don't be such a child.
[engine revs]
(Melissa)
Oh, good. You're here to help.
Uh, where's my dad?
I need to talk to him.
I don't know.
He left me here alone right before the lunch rush.
[customers chatting]
Well, do you know when he's coming back?
[dishes clang in sink]
I have no idea.
Hey. Are you gonna help me or not?
[keys jingle]
[engine starts]
[police siren wails]
Shit!
[siren stops]
[engine shuts off]
Hey!
[Emily knocks]
What are you doing?
Uhh, I had to—
Come on. Out.
Where are you going?
This wouldn't have anything to do with what your mother just told me about you wanting to enlist, would it?
No, no, no, no, no.
Hang—
You know what?
I'm just going to call your dad.
No, please, please.
Look, you don't understand. I—
I didn't get the track scholarship.
I couldn't tell Mom.
Look, I can't stay here forever.
Okay?
I'll get your mom on board.
Seriously?
[Anne laughs]

Company driver,
I'm a long-haul rider, burning through fumes, living under the wire
Listening to

Radio wilco, can't move too slow,

This old road has been my home and will be—
[radio and engine shut off]
[sniffs]
(Recruiter)
What about your medical history?
Is there anything we need to know about?
Diseases, surgeries?
[to Anne]
Go ahead and have a seat.
I'll be with you in a second.
What we're basically going to do today—
[Recruiter's conversation continues]
All right, so what can I do for you?
Uh, I'm here to enlist.
[phone buzzes]
Great. Do you have your
[buzzing continues] social security card and birth certificate?
[buzzing continues]
[buzzing stops]
Okay, fill this out for me, and I'm going to finish up with these folks, and I'll be right with you, okay?
Okay, thanks.
[Recruiter talking with the other family]
[phone buzzes]
[buzzing continues]
Hello?
Yeah, I just got here, what?
[dramatic music]
What?
Yeah, no— why would she do that?
All right. Miss Foreman.
I have to go.
Let's see.
Anne K. Foreman.
Five-foot-three, from Glouster, Ohio?
[sniffling]
Mmhmm.
That's down in Athens County, right?
All right.
And you're only 17?
Yes, sir.
[sniffling]
Did your parents bring you today?
Um, no, I have their consent form.
[papers rustling]
Is everything all right, Miss Foreman?
Miss Foreman.
[sniffling]
[crying]
[music fades]
[door swings open]
[keys jingling]
Come here.
[voice on TV talking]
(Melissa)
Here you go.
Uh, no, thank you.
I'm okay, actually, today.
Oh, okay.
Can you pack up mom's lunch for me though?
Sure.
The kid's mom is gonna press charges.
I mean, really, Emily, what were you thinkin'?
He fell on his face when he was running away from me,
I told you.
That is such bullshit.
You're gonna be lucky if you don't get probation.
Are you serious?
You just can't go beat the shit out of some kid because he's smoking pot and calling you names.
He spit in my face.
I should be the one pressing charges and apologized to.
That fucking kid—
- That's enough. That's enough.
Just do your job, and I'll see what I can do.
But this is the last time
I'm backin' you up.
You have got to get your shit together.
[car beeps]
What did he say?
I might get probation.
That's bullshit.
Did you tell him the kid called you a "dyke?"
Yeah.
Honestly, it's fine.
It really could be worse.
Let's go somewhere.
We can go up to that bar in Nelsonville.
I can't—I told you,
I have my mom.
Just tell Adam you'll be a little late.
Can we maybe do it tomorrow?
I could ask my sister to watch her.
Sure.
Can we not do that here?
I'll take you home.
No, thanks. I'll walk.
[car beeps]
[door thuds]
[engine roars]
[voice on TV talking]
[snoring]
Ow.
Hi.
Hey.
I was out just for just a second.
Where's my mom?
She's in her room watching TV.
I'll go bring her dinner.
All right.
Mom?
I'm not sure—
Hey, wait!
Hey, look, I'm really sorry.
- Mom?
Mom?
Get out.
I'm really, really sorry.
The fuck am I paying you for?
[brakes squeak]
[car beeps]
Mom?
Hey, are you okay?
Where are you going?
What is this?
Is this Loretta's?
[Margaret chuckles]
Let's take you home.
You wanna go home?
You gotta be kidding me.
[siren blares]
Hey! Drop the weapon!
[laughing]
Sorry, again, about you seeing me.
I should probably join the local fire department or somethin'.
(Loretta)
What's going on?
Uh, nothing.
I was just giving him a ride from uptown.
Do you wanna stay and have a drink?
I can't. I have mom in the car.
She got out again.
- Is she okay?- I fired Adam.
Yes, he fell asleep.
She's fine.
- What an asshole.
She had this one her.
I think it's yours.
Ohhh!
Yeah, thank you.
You think maybe you can take care of her tomorrow, after the hospital?
I already promised that
I would help out at the pound.
Well, I don't have any options.
You think you can help me out this once?
- You can't call in sick or something?
- No, I cannot call in sick,
I'm a cop.
Okay, okay, okay.
'Night.
Mom, are you almost ready?
Mom?
Mom?
Did you take your underwear off?
Okay. Okay, hold it.
Come on up. Come on up.
Let me get it.
[Emily gasps]
Okay, sit, sit, sit.
Sorry. Sit.
[urine trickles]
[Margaret exhales]
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
[Margaret cries]
Mom, here, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
[Margaret sobbing]
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hang on.
(Margaret)
One, two.
- There we go.
(Emily)
I don't understand, she remembers me.
She remembers Loretta.
She remembers my dad sometimes.
(Doctor)
I know.
It's a really hard decision, difficult position.
But you need to think about what's best for her right now, and keeping her safe.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Let me know what I can do.
I am not putting her in a home.
Em, we gotta do what's best for her.
I'm taking care of her myself.
Did you hear what the doctor said?
She needs her daughters, not some stranger that doesn't give a shit.
That's not what's happening here.
Why do you care anyway?
She's living with me.
She's staying with you because you insisted on it.
It doesn't mean that I don't care.
You care now because you've taken us to the doctor once?
And paying a kid to fall asleep on the job, that's doing it?
- At least I give a shit.
What do you do besides fuck around?
(Emily)
Mom, let's go.
[car door slams]
[Margaret groans]
[door thuds]
[spatula scraping]
Hey, sleeping beauty.
Hungry?
Here, come here.
Let's sit you up.
Good scrambled eggs.
Mmm.
- Good?
- Mm.
[pictures rustling]
No.
[orchestral TV score]
Dad's favorite show.
[Margaret laughs]
[both laughing]
Do you remember dad?
Dad used to work all day in the mines.
[laughs]
- No, not your dad.
- No?
My dad.
Your husband.
[orchestral music continues]
[voice on TV talking]
[knocking]
[knocking]
Hey.
Hey.
[utensils clank]
I just wanted to see Mom.
[envelope crinkles]
What is this?
It's...it's for Mom.
It's enough money to get her started in a nursing home.
[Emily sighs]
Emily.
Do you even care?
Of course I care, I—
You know she needs constant care,
Em, we—
[bills crash]
I don't need your fucking money.
Okay.
[faucet runs]
[voices on TV talking]
Hey.
Do you think you could come over for a few hours and watch my mom?
[voices on TV continue]
[knocking]
Coming.
Hi. Thank you so much.
No problem.
These are her pills.
Her next dose is at noon.
She gets only one.
Okay.
She's just in her room sleeping.
Hey.
Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.
Let me know if you need anything or if something happens.
Okay. Bye.
[phone buzzes]
[buzzing continues]
Hey.
[door creaks]
What's going on?
I can't find my money.
What money?
Just money that I saved.
You think someone broke in?
No.
[sighs]
Loretta and I got into it last night.
And I keep hoping she hid it somewhere to fuck with me.
What the hell, Loretta?
You can't just take Robert's fucking money and then disappear.
If you don't fucking tell me what's going on,
I'm gonna just give the money back.
[police radio chatters]
[seat belt clicks]
[siren blaring]
(Emily)
Talk to your parents.
Go. Good luck.
[food truck door shuts]
[food truck engine revs]
Hey, it's Emily.
I was wondering if you could pack up Mom's lunch for me.
Hello.
What the hell happened?
Why wouldn't you call me?
It's just a scratch.
[Emily groans]
Mom.
(Margaret)
I'm bad.
She's fine.
It isn't a deep cut.
It's fine.
I was in the bathroom, and I heard a noise.
[dish shards clatter]
Look, I'm sorry.
I was away for less than a minute.
I guess she was trying to get something from the kitchen.
So you're not gonna talk to me?
[door creaks]
Whoa, Mom!
Mom, mom, mom.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come here.
What?
Come here. Let's have a seat.
I know, I know, I know.
Yeah, it's fine.
All right, let's have a seat.
You got blood on your sweater.
(Margaret)
Uh-oh.
(Emily)
We'll just get you a new sweater, okay?
Stop avoiding me.
I'm just trying to help.
What?
(Margaret)
Who is that girl?
Emily?
- She's my friend, Mom.
Get out.
You are so pathetic.
[door slams]
(Police Dispatcher)
Hey, Emily, we got a call from the boathouse up at Burr Oak.
Potential theft.
Can you take a look?
Over.
Copy that. I'll be over in ten.
I'll be right back, okay?
Hello, officer.
Hey, Jimmy, what's going on?
Well, Tim rented a boat earlier today to a young lady for an hour.
It's been four hours now, and she hasn't come back.
I don't know where she is.
[boat motor roars]
[dramatic music]
[boat engine shuts off]
(Captain)
Maybe we'll find something.
Maybe not. Who knows?
Okay?
We don't know anything yet, so don't assume too much.
I need to check the lake house and see if anyone saw anything.
Brian's already taking care of that.
Why don't you take a few hours?
[train horn blaring]
[train wheels clanking]
Mom.
[sobbing]
[train rumbles]
All right.
Here, take it.
Take it.
Mom! Mom!
- No.
- Please take this pill.
Mom, we're taking a pill tonight.
Open up. Open up.
- No.
- Mom!
Just do it.
[Margaret spits]
[slap]
[Margaret whimpers]
Mom, are you okay?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Come here.
Will you take this?
Please?
[dramatic music]
[truck roars]
(Diver)
There's nothing more we can do tonight.
We'll start again in the morning.
[music fades]
[breathing]
[lighter clicks]
[exhales]
My turn.
Here, guess this one.
Flower.
No!
[both laugh]
That was close though it was a cloud with rain.
- Nice.
- That was pretty good.
I told you, man. I'm getting better.
That was good.
You know, I never smoked until I was 40 years old?
Not even one time.
- Really?- Yeah.
- You missed out.
- I know.
Now that I know what it tastes like.
But...the very first night that I ever smoked was actually the last night that I ever fought.
We were in New York City, Madison Square Garden,
And I got my ass kicked, bad.
[Loretta laughs]
But, Joe Frazier was in the crowd, and he felt so bad for me that he sent his boys up with a box of Cubans.
Like a fancy box, fancy lighter, the whole works.
So the first time I ever smoked?
[mouth clicks]Box of Cubans.
You smoked a box of Cubans?
Dude, I smoked a whole box of Cubans.
[laughing]
Didn't you get sick?
I threw up everywhere.
[both laughing]
I didn't know, man, I didn't know you weren't supposed to inhale.
I never even had a cigarette before, nobody told me anything.
But hey, I was hooked.
I'm sorry, where'd you get that ugly thing?
Oh, see this?
Go for it quick, before it fades away.
[laughing]
Stop.
Oh no. No I'm lying.
I got it at a garage sale in Texas.
What were you doing in Tex—[knock at the door]
(girl's voice)
Dad?
- Hey! Sarah, what's up?
- We were gonna get dinner, remember?
Yeah, just hang on a sec.
I'll be right out.
All right. I'll be waiting down in the car with mom.
[pants rustling]
[inaudible]
[whispering]
What am I supposed to do?
[whispering]
Look, I'm sorry.
[Sam kisses Loretta]
[whispering]
I'll make it up to you, all right?
[whispering]
Come on.
[door shuts]
[keypad beeping]
[stove lighter clicking]
[water trickling]
[car approaching]
[car door shuts]
(Emily)
She had this on her. I think it's yours.
Oh, yeah, thank you.
You think maybe you can take care of her tomorrow?
After the hospital?
I already promised that
I would help out at the pound.
Well, I don't have any options.
Think you can help me out this once?
- I gave them my word.- I don't have anything right now,
- I know.- It's just volunteer work.
You can't just like call in or something?
- No I can't just call in, I'm a cop.
I have a real job.
- Okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay.
[door opening]
'Night.
[money rustling]
[Sam breathing heavily]
Hey!
Woo! What are you doing here?
[keys jingling]
I just wanted to give you these.
What's going on?
I can't do this anymore.
Why not?
[keys hit the table]
Come on, Sam.
I don't get this.
What did you expect me to do last night?
You know, I'm not stupid.
I mean, I know what this is.
I know what we are.
Look, this is how it ended up.
This is what we've got.
All right? We have us, and we have our families.
You know, I don't?
I have you for two hours a week.
And what do you want me to do?
Leave my family?
Why don't you grow up?
This isn't high school.
[engine starting]
[water trickling]
[glove compartment opens]
What is this?
You know she needs constant care, Em, we—
[bills crash]
I don't need your fucking money.
[voices on TV talking]
Do you remember this?
That fair they have by the lake every year?
Well, they used to.
I don't think they have it anymore.
But do you, do remember this?
[TV character shouts]
You and me and Emily and Daddy used to go.
[dramatic music]
God, I'm so lonely, Mama.
You know that? I'm so fucking lonley.

Are you okay, young lady?
Are you lost?
No...Can I get a ride?
Where're you going?
Wherever you're headed is fine.
Hop in.
[engine starting]
(Driver)
All right sweetie, this is far as I'm goin'.
[southern rock music]
(Bartender)
Need another?
Mmhmm.
Enjoy.

# Firebird.2021.1080p.BluRay.x264-GETiT.eng.srt
Black thorns and roses.
Smiles and tears.
They're sown together and grow so near.
Dima, wait!
- I win.
- All right.
- Come. Let's go back.
- Oh, relax.
Sergey?
Enjoy yourself for once.
One more time. Please.
Race you to the rocks.
OK, but you're going to lose again. Ready?
Luisa, quick.
Halt. Identify yourself.
- Stop or I'll shoot.
- Popov? It's Sidorov.
Sidorov?
You again.
Kurilka, 0900 hours.
Next time, I'll shoot you.
Oh! Volodja.
Sergeant Popov's easy.
Two packs of cigarettes.
Life's about who you know.
We can't all have your connections.
You could have my connections,
Luisa. You could have them all.
Oh, bloody rocks!
Get up!
Fucking lazy rats.
Slow. Stupid.
Useless little rats.
Faster.
- Attention.
- At ease.
Comrade Colonel, second squadron ready to manoeuvre.
You know, one day the colonel is going to open his flight reports and find your human-anatomy diagrams.
It's the hardest exam.
Then one more to go - scientific communism.
I'm not going to have a life.
It'll be worth it in the end.
Let's do the morning report.
Selenoy, 1:34.
Tokarev, 1:12.
You won't reconsider the colonel's offer?
Give me one good reason.
Two good reasons.
You could make a career for yourself here, rather than stack hay in the middle of nowhere.
What else is there?
Sergey. Luisa. Wait.
Sergey, take our photograph, for posterity.
Not again.
- I'm going to the canteen.
- Please.
Smile in this one.
Comrade Lieutenant.
We were ordered to take this photograph for the weekly journal.
At ease.
Let me take one of all of you.
Move to your right.
Which way to the commander's office?
Comrade Lieutenant, I'll show you.
Since the NATO forces increased surveillance of our border,
I've got four Migs up in the air around the clock.
We now assume each B-52 is carrying several thermonuclear devices.
Should just one slip through, they will be on the direct air corridor to Leningrad.
It will be your duty to prevent this from happening.
- Understood?
- Yes, Comrade Colonel.
Welcome, Lieutenant Matvejev.
Dismissed.
Send him in.
So, young man, I hear you have declined my offer to stay on.
What are your plans?
I will return home to find work, Comrade Colonel.
Very well.
Take the Uazik and drive the lieutenant to the officers' block.
You'll be receiving some additional duties n your final weeks.
Yes, Comrade Colonel.
Orderly.
Yes, Comrade Major.
No, he has not returned.
I will report immediately,
Comrade Major.
Here.
I'm afraid there are no facilities to develop photographs here,
Comrade Lieutenant.
Now there are.
- You develop photographs too?
- Yes, I do.
- I'll finish it myself.
- Yes, Comrade Lieutenant.
- Permission to leave?
- Granted.
Private.
Thank you, Comrade Lieutenant.
Matvejev.
Graduating with first-class hon ours, eh?
Don't they say those who do well at flight school have problems handling their equipment in the sky?
I was told that one particular pilot here has problems in that department.
Time will tell.
Shit! Volkov is on duty tonight.
He woke up the second unit at 0300 hours because he found a cigarette butt outside their barracks.
He made them run 10km into the forest, dig it a grave and give it a full burial with hon ours.
What a dick.
What?
At least someone's getting it tonight.
Hey, Matvejev.
Kissed my chances goodbye.
Now I see why she didn't come swimming with us.
What's the matter with you?
I told you. "Like a sister"?
You are in love.
Sergey, do something about it.
Before it's too late.
The safety of the squadron is paramount.
There will come a day when you have to choose between missing your target or saving your wing man's life.
There's a fine line between bravery and recklessness.
Tomorrow, we will proceed with the high-altitude attack scenario.
That is all.
- Private Serebrennikov?
- Comrade Lieutenant.
At ease. Is Luisa here?
No, she went to human resources, Comrade Lieutenant.
That's fine. I'll come by later.
Comrade Lieutenant.
Permission to ask you a question.
Would you have time to develop some photographs later?
You're too soft.
Harder. Not one spot left.
A love letter from another admirer of yours.
- It's been opened again.
- Must be such a fun job, reading all the thrilling letters from your mother.
Come on. We're playing durak in the Lenin room.
Sergey.
Get out of your fantasy world.
Maybe later.
Take it by the corner, and gently place it in the water tray.
- Like this, Comrade Lieutenant?
- That's better.
And call me Roman.
You really see other people, Sergey.
You capture their essence, their soul.
I search for something deeper, but I can't quite grasp it.
How do you mean?
When you take a photo there's something in that very moment which is gone forever.
A moment that will never be there again.
Like a ghost escaping this world.
I didn't know you were a philosopher.
I think we need a drink.
So I gave him a lower score.
The radio was practically melting with his anger.
He was yelling and threatening like I'd slept with his wife.
You know it?
Tchaikovsky.
When I first heard it, I was 14.
My best friend Misha was in it.
I've never seen a real ballet.
How could you be so uncultured coming from Orel?
I've seen a lot of theatre before being locked up here.
Now there's no chance.
Let's check the photos.
Steady there, Private.
I should be getting back.
I shouldn't even be here.
- You'd better sleep it off here.
- No, I can't
I'll tell the duty officer that
I needed you at the hangar.
No, no, no. I have to go.
I can't stay.
Listen. If you turn up at the barracks like this, you'll be cleaning the toilets for a week.
Oh, shit.
Put your fucking coat on!
Why can't you dress yourself like any other pig here?
Lebedev.
Did I give you permission to leave the barracks last night?
No, Comrade Sergeant.
Then why the fuck were you smoking outside?
What's your problem?
Why the fuck are you staring at me with those dewy wept eyes?
- Are you a pervert?
- No, Comrade Sergeant.
Then why the fuck do you look like one?
What the fuck are you smiling at?
Go fuck up the pervert.
Go fuck up the pervert.
Are you fucking deaf?
Go fuck up the pederast now!
- To the stations.
- To the stations.
This is a combative exercise.
After I'm done at the regional HQ,
I want to show you something.
- What is it?
- You'll see.
You haven't said a word since we left.
I hope it wasn't that bad.
No. I loved it. I'm sorry.
Whenever I used to watch a play with my best friend Dima.
I'd never want it to end.
Dima grew up without a mother and me without a father.
It sort of created this invisible bond between us.
We'd write secret letters to each other and sign them Valentin.
- Valentin?
- Zubkov.
The fighter pilot who became an actor.
We wanted to be just like him.
We even promised we'd go to the same drama school in Moscow together.
What happened?
It was just a silly dream.
What will you do after you leave the base?
Go back to the farm, support my mother, find work.
Couldn't you support her even better if you studied in Moscow and got a job at Mosfilm?
- I'd never get in.
- How do you know?
Because they only take 20 people from across the country.
There are hundreds of conscripts here but the colonel chose you.
"It is not in the stars to hold our destiny, but in ourselves."
Shakespeare.
Pull over.
This could take a while.
Look.
They're dancing with each other.
Oh. Shit.
That definitely wasn't a blueberry.
Do you have a girl back home?
No.
Do you?
Shit! Border guards.
What happened to you last night?
I thought you were going to go after her, not ignore her even more.
I had to drive the lieutenant.
That late? We waited for you.
Luisa kept going on and on about him, so I told her to stop and then she got mad at me and went home.
Where did you drive him?
He went to the theatre.
And then?
Then we were delayed coming back.
- What?
- Sergey, you've got that look.
No, really. I was on duty.
You've found another girl, haven't you?
- Tell me, who is she?
- Swap, anyone?
Kolja, I'll swap with you.
Yes, Sergey.
Come on, Sergey.
- So, how is he?
- Who?
Lieutenant Matvejev.
Not like the other officers.
That's what I thought.
I have to drive him to Tallinn this weekend.
What do you think?
Where should I take him?
I could come and show him around, if Lieutenant Matvejev doesn't mind.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Of course.
Stalin is standing in this field, a green field, and there's this farmer nearby, and Stalin...
No, the farmer...
If you insist on telling it, at least do it properly.
Dick.
A farm worker greets Josef
Stalin at his potato farm.
"Comrade Stalin, we have so many potatoes that,
"piled one on top of the other
"they would reach all the way to God," the farmer excitedly tells...
Go on, Private Serebrennikov.
Go on. I love a good joke.
Go on.
"But God does not exist," replies Stalin.
"Exactly," says the farmer.
"Neither do the potatoes."
"Neither do the potatoes."
That's a good one.
Follow me.
Telling jokes of that nature could interfere greatly with your future prospects.
We have immense responsibility for how we affect society.
So I'd choose more carefully which stories you tell.
This will never happen again,
Comrade Major.
I do hope so.
For your own sake.
One more thing.
According to the orderly's logbook, on your trip to Tallinn, you returned the Uazik at 22:34.
What was the cause of such a delay?
The lieutenant was attending the theatre, Comrade Major.
We were delayed at the crossing at Risti.
The gates were broken again.
I did everything I could to return as quickly as possible.
Whom did he attend the theatre with?
The lieutenant was alone, Comrade Major.
I see.
You will report to me if you notice anything outside the ordinary.
- Understood?
- Yes, Comrade Major.
Dismissed.
And the Oleviste church was the tallest building in medieval Europe.
That there is treasure buried under Mary's chapel.
Sorry.
Thank you.
How do I look?
You are right.
Oh, thank you.
Would you like one?
Thank you, Comrade Lieutenant.
And this, of course, is the famous cobbled street where Lenin had his first pair of boots made.
Luisa?
- Olga.
- Luisa.
It's been years.
- You look so good.
- You too.
Hello.
Which one of these handsome men are you married to?
- Olga!
- Don't tell me.
This one's your husband?
And this must be your brother.
Olga, these are my colleagues from the base.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Colleagues.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- He's so sweet. It's your baby?
- Yes.
Comrade.
Luisa.
"To be or not to be.
That is the question."
To be, or not to be...
That is the question.
To be, or not to be.
That is the question.
Shit!
Who's that?
You scared the hell out of me.
Where's Luisa?
Let's go.
Will you help me with my lines?
- What lines?
- For my audition.
Another one of your dreams.
You know you'll end up going back to the farm.
No, Luisa, I'm serious.
I sent my application.
I'm going to be an actor.
I can't wait to see you on stage, then.
Let's do the reports, then your lines.
Petrov 1:05.
Tokarev 0:52.
Matvejev...
- Comrade Lieutenant.
- At ease.
A little something.
Sergey here told me how well your exam went.
You shouldn't have,
Lieutenant Matvejev.
I'll be right back.
Where were we?
Er... Selenov 1:25.
Yes, Comrade Colonel?
He's ready for you.
He is different.
Platonov.
You exceeded all your targets last week.
Excellent.
- That is all.
- Not quite.
One more thing.
Lieutenant Matvejev, are you familiar with Article
154A of the Criminal Code?
No, Comrade Major. I'm not.
Sexual relations of a man with another man, which is punishable by five years' imprisonment in a hard-lab our camp.
I'm not following,
Comrade Major.
A report has been received implying you have engaged in immoral conduct with a private.
- This is malicious gossip.
- Lieutenant Matvejev.
I wouldn't recommend you interrupt me again.
There was no name of the private in question.
Give me his name.
There is no name to give.
It is a lie.
I assure you, comrades.
Consider your words,
Lieutenant Matvejev.
Comrade Major who wrote this?
It was delivered anonymously, unsigned.
Without hon our.
I trust the lieutenant's word.
Dismissed.
Yes, Comrade Colonel.
Lieutenant.
It would be a pity.
So, when you buy a brand-new Soviet car, what do you get for free?
- I have no idea.
- Train and bus timetable.
- I have a good one, too.
- I have to go.
So, where's my gift?
Sergey.
Listen to me and don't react.
Someone filed a report.
- About us.
- What?
They didn't mention your name but...
But the KGB know something.
You better go, Sergey.
Oh, no. False alarm.
All personnel to stations.
This is a red alert.
I repeat, this is a red alert.
This is not a training exercise.
- Attention.
- At ease.
Comrade Colonel, we have four
B-52 strategic nuclear bombers in neutral air space, on a direct flight path to Leningrad.
011 and 023 are escorting.
Rock. 011.30 seconds to the border.
Permission to engage?
011. Negative. Do not engage.
I repeat, do not engage.
Ten seconds to the border.
Rock. 011. Awaiting orders.
Wait. Targets diverting
90 degrees north.
011 and 023, continue escorting.
Rock. 011. Engine malfunction.
011. Status report?
Power at 30, declining.
Cooling negative.
I've lost the engine.
Permission to abort.
All stations, we have an emergency.
011, drop your weapons and fuel tanks.
023, mark the coordinates.
Mark. 85km.
10,200.
That gives him a range of 73km.
He'll crash at least 10km short.
011, negative.
Proceed to eject over the sea at 3,000.
I can save the plane.
I can fly it at stall speed.
Damn it, he's trying to land.
Matvejey, it's too risky.
I need you to return alive.
Eject. That's an order.
I do not copy.
Parachute negative.
Mark. Parachute negative.
Activate the stop net.
Duty mechanic to control.
Duty mechanic to control.
- Karamazin, Serebrennikov, to the net. Go.
- Yes, Comrade Colonel.
Come on.
- Come on!
- What is it?
Shit. The fuse is blown.
The crank!
Damn it!
It won't move!
Rock. 011. Airfield in sight.
- Permission to land?
- 011, permission granted.
Try now!
Come on. Come on.
Faster.
It's going. Run!
Faster. Faster. Get back to your station, Private.
Serebrennikoy, let's go.
You! You! You!
Get him out of there!
All clear, Lieutenant Matvejev.
You were very lucky today.
Get some rest.
Comrade Lieutenant?
Up here.
For you.
So you won't forget me.
We could get the training plane and fly to Sweden.
Sweden?
Why Sweden?
I don't know.
I don't care as long as we're together.
Sergey, I'm an officer.
I can't leave my motherland.
If you get into drama school.
.I'll find something to do in Moscow, too.
And then we could go to the cinema whenever we wanted.
And take a cruise on the river and watch all the shows at the Bolshoi.
And have an ice cream on Arbat, and then throw up on the American Mountains.
That's decided, then.
All right, then.
Comrade Major.
At ease.
Sounds like you're having fun in here.
Just analysing my flight report,
Comrade Major.
- Alone?
- Yes, Comrade Major.
I see.
Where did you develop these?
Just personal photos, Comrade Major.
Personal.
Matvejev if there is the slightest truth in that report believe me, I will find out.
And nobody can protect you then, not even Kuznetsov.
And I'll personally make sure that you'll never fly again.
Goodnight.
You better return to the barracks now.
Make sure nobody sees you.
Faster! Move it!
Fucking rats.
Move it!
Won't have to listen to him ever again. One more day.
Good luck.
Comrade Lieutenant.
Vasja, wait here.
Colonel's orders.
Comrade Lieutenant?
- Comrade Lieutenant?
- What is it, Private?
I made a plan.
- What plan?
- For Moscow.
Get back to your station, Private.
What?
- Last night...
- Listen...
Comrade Serebrennikov.
There was no last night.
Nothing ever happened between us. Nothing.
Understand?
Moscow? Moscow is where I'll be.
I'll hold you to that.
Vasja.
Sergey don't forget - write to me after your auditions.
Of course.
Take care.
O, happy dagger.
This is thy sheath.
There rust, and let me die.
Let's try again.
If Juliet had just married Paris, who's smart and wealthy, the man of wax, then this terrible tragedy would never have happened.
That's love for convenience.
That's not true love.
Oh, really?
And how does true love behave?
You can't stop thinking about the other person.
You have to be with them no matter what.
But she could save both their lives, and they could still meet up in secret.
And only live half a life?
Romeo doesn't just go "I defy you stars" to see her in secret.
Not when he's madly in love.
I've got to get to my class.
Wait. I'll walk with you.
Have you got time to go over our scenes later?
We could practise at my place.
I can't tonight. I have to practise my monologue.
Sergey, there you are.
Your friend is here.
I'll see you later.
Luisa.
Look at you.
You've become so handsome.
All that time in the library.
- Oh.
- Oh, and edible food.
Your mother still looks so young.
How is she?
Oh, she's... She's fine.
Anyway, you've heard all my news.
How is medical school?
I deferred. I'll go next autumn.
Why?
I'm still working for the colonel.
The days are flying by.
Sergey, so much changed after you left the base.
I needed to come and see you.
I don't want anything to change between us.
Of course.
- Thanks.
- What is it?
I am to be married to Roman.
Roman?
Well, that's...
You're sure?
Of course.
Of course I'm sure.
That's wonderful.
I'm truly happy for you.
For both of you.
I missed you so much.
You will come to our wedding, won't you?
- Sugar?
- Yes.
A toast to Sergey.
We are all here today thanks to you.
Na zdarovje.
- Na zdarovije.
- Na zdarovije.
One more?
Hey-hey! Gorko!
Gorko! Gorko!
Two, three, four, five, six, seven!
Difficult thing to watch the one you love swept off their feet.
I see what goes on under my nose.
It's no consolation now but if he'd never walked onto my base,
I do believe she would have married you.
Thank you, Comrade Colonel.
Excuse me.
How have you been?
Fine.
How is drama school?
It's a lot better than the base.
It's like another world.
Have you got a girl?
Do you love her?
Of course.
She's given up everything for you.
- I had to protect you.
- From what?
You know what happens to men like you.
Men... like me?
What are you, then?
I just married the woman I love.
You really believe that if you live a lie long enough
- it'll suddenly become true?
- Sergey you don't know anything about me.
Wait. Sergey.
Gorko!
I tried.
Sso hard to forget you.
But I can't.
- All these months, I...
- Sergey.
- Waited.
- Sergey.
I thought you'd come.
I couldn't.
What are you doing?
Comrade Major.
Your wife is looking for you.
Thank you, Comrade Major.
I'll be right there.
I must go, Sergey.
We could still go to Moscow together.
Nobody would have to know.
- Have that ice cream on Arbat.
- Sergey.
Luisa is pregnant.
"You have sense enough", said Father Zossima.
"Don't give way to drunkenness
"and incontinence of speech.
"Don't give way to sensual lust
"and to the love of money.
"And above all"
"don't lie."
"You mean about Diderot?"
"No, not about Diderot."
"Above all, don't lie to yourself."
"The man who lies to himself,"
"and listens to his own lie comes to the point"
"that he cannot distinguish the truth within him"
- "Daddy!
- " or around him.
"And so loses all respect for himself and for others."
"And having no respect"
"he ceases to love."
Dinner is ready.
It won't be a holiday.
I'll be doing long hours.
You'd be alone in the city all day.
I think it would be better for you to stay here.
But I don't want to be stuck here.
And he'll miss his daddy.
You have your family here to help you.
Just for a few months.
- Did you think about us?
- Yes.
And?
When I finish in Moscow, they'll promote me.
And we can finally get a bigger apartment.
- Do I have a say in this?
- It's for the best.
Have you seen my jumper?
- Which one?
- The grey winter one.
Why do you have to go?
Serjozha, I'll see you soon.
- You are both mean.
- Serjozha...
- This one?
- Yes.
And that's why I love you.
I should just make it to the train.
See you soon.
Prison, my lord?
Denmark's a prison.
Then is the world one?
A goodly one, in which there are many confines, wards, dungeons.
Denmark being one of the worst.
We think not so, my lord.
Why, then, 'tis none to you, for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.
To me it is a prison.
I'm going to read all his books during the break.
That better not be all you'll be doing.
I'll make sure it won't be.
Or I'll throw his books into the river again.
Sergey? You have a visitor.
What are you doing here?
I... came to see your play.
Did you like it?
The prince was very good.
Thank you.
Sergey
I've been sorting out my apartment, so I have a week off before I start at the academy.
Why are you telling me this?
Didn't you get my letter?
How's your wife, and your child?
Come to Sochi with me.
I have two tickets.
For the 1800 train.
You think you can just turn up here and I'll drop my life?
What was it, could she not join you?
Sergey.
I'll be right there, llya.
I've got to get back to my friends.
Why do you think we use the classics to teach you?
Because the characters of these stories are not intellectuals.
They are living, breathing feeling beings whom are tender, with tremble in their hearts.
And I want you to catch this tremble to your own heart and soul.
Tea?
Train 505 for Sochi is departing now from platform two.
- He's still with that model?
- Yeah.
And she came with him to visit Luisa.
How is she?
Later, Sergey. Later.
Come on!
Roman?
I'm afraid of this dream.
Of waking up.
Of losing you.
I'm here now.
What is it?
You remember my best friend, Dima?
On his 13th birthday my mother made him an apple pie.
He lived by the school.
I wanted him to have it while it was still warm.
So I ran all the way.
When I arrived.
I heard shouting from inside, and so I went around to the window.
My letters were scattered all over the floor.
His father had him pinned to the table.
Beating him across the back yelling, "No son of mine will be a fucking faggot."
I'll never forget his look of disgust.
And then Dima looked up, and saw me.
And I ran away.
I ran away.
He didn't come to school the next day.
There's a lake in the forest near the village.
They found his body there three days later.
I've never told this to anyone.
I have three rules here.
No vodka, no parties with loud music, and no girls.
After 11.
This place is incredible.
Welcome home.
As you requested.
The sickle and the hammer.
First, it cuts off your legs and then it smacks you in the head.
- A drink?
- Need you ask?
Look at this place.
Fighter pilots certainly make lots of money.
Na zdarovje.
Na zdarovje.
Sergey is always so serious about it all.
He'll play Hamlet or Uncle
Vanya the rest of his life.
- Yeah, you are right.
- Nothing wrong with that.
- Matvejev. Fuel is running out.
- Coming right up.
Sergey.
Sorry.
Who'd have thought it?
Actors and pilots getting along so well.
I can't imagine it any other way.
- I knew it.
- No.
Volodja.
- Volodja.
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Volodja.
- I knew it.
Zverev should have investigated my report.
You?
You could have got us sent to prison.
How was I supposed to know it was you?
Why would you do this to her?
You've ruined her life.
Volodja...
- We love each other.
- Stop. Stop it.
- We love...
- Stop it. It is not love.
It's disgusting.
You make me sick.
Fuck this.
You won't tell anyone.
Not Luisa. Not anyone.
No. That is your job.
You really think he's going to leave her and the air force, for you?
More Soviet volunteers arrived in Kabul this week to liberate the people of
Afghanistan.
The Afghani children welcomed the Soviet soldiers with love and national dances.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
- He won't tell her.
- That's good.
Are you expecting someone?
Matvejev?
- Roman Alekseyevich?
- Yes.
Sign here.
What are you waiting for?
Sergey, please. Go and get the rest of your stuff.
Roman, she can't come here.
- I can't tell her to go back.
- Then take her to a hotel.
She's my wife.
You're an actor. Act like you're just visiting.
I have to pretend every fucking second
\of the day I walk out the door.
I will not do it in our home.
Just tell her it's not working.
And then what?
What then?
You'll move in with me at the base?
Hey, get to the back.
Sergey!
- It's so good to see you.
- Yes.
This is Serjozha.
- Hello.
- Hi, Serjozha.
Hi.
He's definitely got Roman's eyes.
- Hasn't he?
- Yes.
How have you been?
I was supposed to go to my mother's for the holidays but when Roman said that you were coming,
I just had to stay and see you.
You are always welcome in our home and you know it.
It's about time that you met
Serjozha too.
Let's see.
Such a big flat. Come on.
When Roma has his night flights,
Serjozha sits by the window and stares into the night, waiting for him to come home.
Yeah.
When Roma finishes here,
I'll start my medical school.
And he'll get a transfer.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Of course.
You have to be with the ones you love.
Yes.
Sergey is there anybody special in your life?
Him.
And you.
And dear Serjozha.
May you have all the blessings of love.
Nothing and...
And no-one will ever replace you.
To your love.
To being with those who you truly love.
To your beautiful family.
- Thank you, Sergey.
- Thank you.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.
May it be the happiest year yet.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.
Roman.
You belong with your family.
You always did.
I won't be the one to take you away from your son, and from Luisa.
- Don't you dare touch me.
- Luisa, let me explain.
- Leave me alone.
- Calm down.
- Get away from me.
- Luisa!
I know now that our love can only exist where there is no thought and no time.
Please don't come looking for me.
- Did you order a long-distance call?
- Yes, I did.
- Kuznetsov.
- Captain Matvejev reporting.
Sergey.
Where did you disappear to?
Oh, I went home to see my mother.
- Roman came looking for you.
- When?
Last month, just before he left Moscow.
Oh, he gave me a letter for you.
I put it with your mail.
- Kuznetsov.
- Comrade Colonel.
Private Serebrennikov calling.
Serebrennikov.
It's been a long time.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
Do you know how
I might reach Captain Matvejev?
I must speak with him urgently.
Matvejev?
Didn't Luisa call you?
He left for Afghanistan shortly after the New Year.
He was assigned to escort convoys from the border to the compound.
Last Monday...
Sergey, we lost him.
No.
That can't be.
Sergey...
Sergey...
To speak and to do, to think and to live...
They are not the same thing, Sergey.
By the time you receive this letter,
I will have left for Afghanistan.
The three days that Kuznetsov gave me to consider are coming to an end.
But what is there to consider?
I can't choose for fear of hurting those I love.
I can't divide myself any longer and belong to everyone at the same time.
Come in.
Nadja, will you have lunch with us?
Why have you come here?
- Luisa, I wanted to...
- To what?
To tell me that our friendship meant nothing to you?
To tell me that you were sleeping with my husband?
I'm so sorry.
Tell his son that you are sorry.
I don't want to hear it.
Since you wanted to sleep with him so badly why don't you go and lie next to him in his grave?
Oh, of course you don't even know where your true love is buried.
Why would they have told you?
You're not his widow.
What were you to him?
You were nothing.
Then why did he move to Moscow to be with me?
Stop it. Stop it, Sergey.
No.
What you felt, and what I felt was the same thing.
My love was no lesser than your love.
You made my life a disgrace.
You made my life a disgrace.
- I trusted you my whole life.
- How could I have told you?
- How could I have told you?
- I married him.
Don't you understand that?
Here.
Take these before you go.
I have no use for them.
Not in front of him.
- Oh.
- Oh, Luisa.
I'm so sorry,
I didn't know you had company.
I'll come by later.
Hi, Serjozha.
Did Daddy come back with you?
- No.
- But why?
We already talked about this.
Daddy's gone to live in heaven.
But why?
Because...
Because he had to.
- But when is Daddy coming back?
- Serjozha.
Get me the shoes, please.
Show me. What is this?
Sergey
I have to choose the only place where I still feel free.
The sky.
Please don't wait for me.
Forget me.
I shall always think of you, Sergey.
No matter what life may bring,
I will always be there with you.

I hate train journeys, me.
I always end up gipping my guts up.
When were you last on a train?
I'm just saying.
It's 100 odd Swaledale crossed blackface gimmers.
Do you understand me?
And what about milk?
Just got a few beef cattle, nowt much to speak of.
No, sorry, the sheep.
Do you make cheese?
It's very good cheese, and good money.
DEIHDRE:
Your English is good.
My mother teaches English back in Romania.
Fancy.
We muddle through on our own most of t' time but wi' lambing and that our lad needs extra help.
It's perfect for me.
You got somewhere to go after?
Good, cos we just need someone for the week, lad.
We're not running a charity for waifs and strays, like.
Have you pressed my collared shirt, Nan?
- It's hung up in your wardrobe.
If you would but try looking further than your own backside.
Right. Got any clean socks an' all?
Go easy on the sauce tonight, lad.
I need you to take me up to Top Fell early tomorrow show them ewes to this one.
They'll be ripe to drop.
Do you hear me?
- Aye, I've heard you.
What are you two in cahoots about?
JOHNNY: Nowt. Ta.
- MARTIN: Oi, ignorant!
Why don't you ask him if he fancies a pint'?
No, please, it's OK.

It's reading week, isn't it?
You know what me mam's like.
Came up with a couple of my uni mates.
Makes it bearable.
Brought 'em to gawp and laugh at the natives?
Get over yourself.
You're not that interesting as a local tourist attraction.
Got a spare one of them or what?
Come on, you tight wad.
I'm just a poor student.
Come on.
Ta.
We should have a night out.
Bradford or somewhere?
What?
- That's what I love about folk like you.
You fuck off to your posh colleges an' that and swan back here on your holidays, thinking you know it all.
Some of us just have to get on wi' it, like.
Alright. It's just a night out.
- Aye, to you.
I'll tell me cows they can go without their teas shall I cos I'm off gallivanting around Bradford?
You'd like my uni mates.
They're a laugh.
One of them's a real laugh.
What do you mean by that?
He's nice. You'd like him.
He's funny.
Remember? Like you used to be.

Right. You can lamb up on t' fell, rebuild that wall while you're at it.

You sh0uld've bothered fixin' t' fencing in t' back paddock when I asked you months back.

MUSIC: "The Days" by Patrick Wolf
The Days
Passing days
 I see the steeple
 And trace to the spire
 And the sunset
Deep in regret
 Phoenix in final fire
And the time stops
Rush-hour traffic slows
And my heart starts
 Beating this dark
 Through old flesh and cold bones
 And I long to be carried on
 Just once to be lifted strong
 Out of the loneliness
 And the emptiness
 Of the days
 Days
 Passing days
 Days
 I remember I had your love once
 Seized my body whole
 And in our first dance
 I thought by chance
 God had matched my soul
 But time brought its travelling
 This distance and solitude
 And in that travelling
 My self damaging
 I took my love far, far from you
 But don't you still long to be carried on
 Once more I could lift you strong
 Out of the loneliness
 And the emptiness
 Of the days
Passing days
Passing days
Days
Tell me
Have we gone too far?
 Or did we get too close?
You've no father
I've no son
But when we come ghost
I promise I will meet you s: I will meet you
 At the end of the days
The days
Passing days
 Won't you meet me at the end of the days'? it

# Mala.Noche.1986.1080p.WEBRip.x264.AAC-YTS.MX.srt
Working in the store Sunday all day.
Can I help you?
I want to drink this Mexican boy, Johnny Alonzo, from LA near Riverside.
He makes my heart throb--
♪ Thumpety bum, bum, bum, bum, bum ♪ when I see him.
He says he's 18, but he could be 16.
Do you want some chips?
All I want to do is caress him.
I want to hold him.
What's that? He has these hickeys on his neck.
What have you got there?
He likes men.
What's that?
That looks like a hickey.
Gonna be your friend.
Su amigo.
He's out on the street with friends staying in a three-dollar-a-night... cheap hotel room on Sixth off skid road.
And he speaks almost no English.
Hey, tell him I'm not the Immigration.
¿Cómo se llama?
Me llamo Johnny Alonzo.
And you don't have any place to stay, do you?
Look here, man.
Let me have a pack of Top, will ya?
That's all I wanna hear.
- There you go, huh?
- All right. Thanks a lot.
Thanks.
Hey, Johnny.
Hola.
¿Qué pasa?
Es muy frío.
Come here, you little cutie.
You need a place to stay tonight?
I mean, there's always my place.
Okay?
And it's right across from the YWCA over there.
Hey. Wait a minute.
Come back.
No way.
I'm in love with this boy.
Really.
You are always in love.
No. I mean, Sarah, he just came into the store.
I mean, I'm sure he just got into town.
You see people come into the store all the time.
Let me invite him to dinner.
Okay.
So where are we gonna find him?
I don't know.
Hmm.
The street.
How old is he?
He says he's 18, but--Oh.
I don't know.
He's probably--
Vegetables and rice.
Sounds good.
I don't care. Even--
Even if it jeopardizes working at the store,
I have to show him that-- that I'm gay for him.
I have to show him how I feel.
What are you doing out here by yourself, honey?
Oh, I-- I'm waiting for some friends of mine, actually.
Oh, okay. You're all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.
Hello. Hola.
You ran out without paying?
Are they looking for you now?
Are they after you?
Um, we're gonna be leaving pretty soon actually.
I'm sorry. I didn't know you're--
Are you married?
Well, no. It's a--
It's some friends of mine.
You know, usually people cook, you know, they're married.
It's kind of dumb.
No. Um, you're gonna get hit, you know.
Oh, God. I've been hit before, you know.
Hey. What are you doing under my car?
Johnny.
No, we'd like to invite you over-- Excuse me.
We'd like to invite you for dinner.
We're gonna make you some good food.
We're hoping to cook him for dinner tonight.
You're gonna cook him for dinner?
Gonna make something for them to eat actually.
¿Tienes hambre?
Are you hungry?
Come on.
Sure. Sure. Come on.
Take care, okay?
Okay. You too, lady.
Be careful.
Bye-bye.
¡Guau!
Hey. Hey.
What are you doing?
I am gonna be making you some good food.
Where'd you get this stuff at?
No, no. I'm gonna be cooking some vegetables.
Listen to her.
All right. All right.
He is a sugar freak.
¿Permiso?
Sí.
It's okay. Sure. We can go back.
It's all right. Don't freak out.
What's the matter?
He wants to go back to the hotel.
It's okay. Sí. Es posible.
- Okay. I'll take him back. Then we'll--
- Sí. Es posible.
Hey.
Sure. Sure. Tell him to come.
Let him get in the front.
Get in the front.
There's room up here.
Hola.
Un momentito.
Shh.
What'd he say?
Well, he says that when, um, they first came on the train, they had another friend with them, and-- and the police came--
¿Tres policía?
Sí.
There were, like, three police.
Jumped him, and they--
They hurt their friend.
Killed him?
That's horrible.
I think he, like, killed him.
- What's this--
- The biggest pro--
The biggest problem is you get too far removed from the death aspect.
It's like you walk into McDonald's, and they just line the cows up... and they bump 'em all off for you, and you never have to see it happening.
If you had to go out there and kill every piece of meat that you ate, that's a-- that's a little easier for me to buy, because you experience the death.
You see it happening, and you realize what you're doing when you eat it.
But when you walk into a McDonald's and say, "Uh, give me a Big Mac," you know, you're just getting dead cow and you never see the cow die.
That's--
All those poisons release at the time of death too.
Bad for your karma.
So it's not bad to eat food without meat in it. You know. You can survive.
Nice meeting you.
- Adiós.
Gracias. Gracias.
De nada. De nada.
We returned downhill through the tunnel curves fast.
Jesus Christ. The boy's insane, like all Mexicans, about driving fast and crazy.
In the front seat next to him
I cover my eyes, tell him to slow down.
It's too late to get control of the wheel.
The look on his face is pure ecstasy.
The incredible, beautiful, turned-on face of an ignorant Mexican teenager.
His friends laughing in the backseat, driving a maniacal machine downhill as fast as he can go.
I'll give you $15 if I can sleep with Johnny.
Quince dólares.
¿Sí? Para me and Johnny.
Is okay? ¿Bien?
Quince dólares.
I wish I had more. I wish I had a hundred.
I love you.
Come on.
Ask him.
Mm-mmm.
I'd give you 50 if I had it, but I only have 15.
Quince dólares para tú.
Fifteen dollars?
Come on. Angel face.
- I want to sleep with him.
- Okay, vamos.
Where the hell do you think you're goin'?
Upstairs.
No visitors.
No, we're not visitors.
Uh, I'm with him.
We're going upstairs.
Got a key?
The key.
Doesn't have it.
No visitors.
Oh, come on. We're going upstairs.
You're not going anywhere.
He lives here.
Where's his key?
Get out of here.
We're going upstairs.
No, you're not going anywhere.
Open the door.
No.
Come on. Just open the door.
Get out.
What's it gonna hurt you? Just open the door.
Get out. Get out.
Bitch!
You fat cow!
Shit!
Damn slut!
Fat cow!
What are you gonna do?
You're locked out too.
You want to stay at my place?
You can stay there.
It's better than out here.
Okay?
Fuckin' bitch!
I have to go work for about an hour.
I'll be right back.
Make yourself at home.
Más lento. Más lento.
Slow down.
He said he needed to tomar agua-- get some water.
Is that when he slips the
$10 bill from my pants, or did I lose it?
I think he got it.
They need money-- Johnny and him.
I hope they got it.
Though I was upset that I'd been fucked, violated and lost the money too, for a few moments, thinking about it, in the morning... of the Mexicans gloating over having fucked the gringoputo and got his money too, talking about it and laughing, my ass sore.
And the more I think about it, the more I know I asked for a reckless evening.
Johnny'll probably never look at me or talk to me as a friend.
He probably wouldn't have in the first place. I had to find out-- to get as close to him as I could, even if it turned into a shit-bad night.
Hey, buddy, how's it going?
All right.
What can I get ya?
Oh, we need a fifth of Night Train.
Fifth of Night Train.
Yeah.
He said he was gonna return to LA in 15 days, as soon as he got traveling money together.
He lives with nine or 10 brothers.
Maybe when they're making love they can think about Roberto having fucked me.
Roberto's cock fucks Johnny fucked me.
That's about as close to Johnny as I'll ever get.
Unless I had the money.
Poor boys never win.
Who fucks whom?
Mala noche.
Every street Mexican on Sixth will think he can stick it in me.
Well, they're wrong.
But they never were too smart to begin with, or they wouldn't be here.
Chíngalo. My ass is sore.
It's true.
I think he tried to use his cock like a weapon on me, macho fucking prick.
Johnny comes into the store often.
An acquaintance of mine brought a camera into the store the other day, and I gave him $10 for it.
We decided to go out and see if it worked.
It does!
Hey!
Pepper talks to a dog we find on the street, and I say,
"You lead a dog's life."
I don't think he understands.
Johnny doesn't want-- doesn't want to be in our movie.
And tells me Roberto wants to learn to drive the car.
Tell me.
Randy. Is that your name?
- No, no. My name's Walt.
- Walt. All right, Walt.
- Okay, Walt. I'm Dieter.
- Yeah.
This is my cousin Franz.
Ah. Good to meet you, Franz.
We went through the Second World War.
Yeah, can I have some Night Train?
Right where his daddy was born.
Buck and a half.
Hola.
What happened with the police?
Are they after you, or--
Can I get you something?
¿Tienes hambre?
Cuidado.
Veinticinco.
Para tú, nada.
¿Y eso por qué? Cuidado.
Un momentito.
Hey!
Hasta luego.
Shut up.
Hey. Little brother.
Come here.
Me speak a little English.
"A circuit court jury in Portland unanimously convicted...
22-year-old
Armando Zamora Flores, a transient, of murder and first-degree robbery... in the slaying of William Somerset, 53."
Night--
"1543 Bidwell Street."
Hey, hey, hey.
Look. "Flores, through a
Spanish-speaking interpreter"--
"maintained that they thought they were going to another tavern, but went instead to Somerset's house."
Hey, hey.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
"He said there a man made homosexual advances towards him, and when he refused, came at him with a knife.
They struggled, and Flores said he stabbed Somerset."
Friend of yours?
You see how sad that is?
Nope.
Vámonos.
You know any--
Great. You got a gun, huh?
You can't just carry it around like that.
What are you trying to prove?
You're gonna shoot your balls off with it.
What are you gonna do if somebody pulls a gun on you, and you have to use it?
Look.
Don't point that thing.
It's not a toy.
Take it out of here.
Man.
Get it out of the store.
You're just gonna get in trouble.
Take the pie. Vamoose.
Take it and go.
Roberto never acknowledges the fuck of the night before.
It's as though it never happened.
Johnny has two tiny pimples-- zits from bad food on his chin.
And he looks sleepy all the time.
Look, driving's not a game for kids.
All right? It's serious.
Johnny!
No!
¡Juanito!
¡Muchachos!
The police are gonna pick us up.
¡Muchacho!
Pull over right now.
I'm gonna drive.
You can drive later.
I just don't want you to kill me.
We can't stay here forever.
Get in the car.
Get back in the car.
We're heading west towards the Pacific Ocean.
Johnny will never, never go anywhere with me alone.
I find that sad and absurd.
But it's part of the game that he and I play in having a relationship at all.
I don't take it personally.
He feels more comfortable surrounded by his friends.
I don't want to interfere with their lives.
If these two friends are happy, that's the way it should be.
A gringo like me has an easy life-- a privileged life-- and just because
I see someone attractive like Johnny... doesn't mean I should be able to have him, to buy him or whatever, just because he's hungry and on the street, desperate, good-looking.
That wasn't my intention exactly, but it could be misunderstood that way.
Get back here!
Cough 'em up, you little niño.
Muchacho.
Give me the keys, you little shit!
Open the door! Open the--
Open the door.
Open it.
Where you goin'? Sto--
What are you doing?
Oh, great.
Look. Open the door.
Open it up.
Open the fucking--
Stop the car!
Bring it back here!
The drink's--
That's for credit.
No credit. I'm sorry, buddy.
It's 3.69. You got cash,
I'll sell it to you.
No credit.
Credit's like sex.
Some get it, some don't.
Sorry, buddy.
The plan is simple.
I go to his room at midnight.
He opens the door, sees that I want him that badly--
I lay down at his feet like a dog.
Or rather, at the feet of Roberto and him and--
And after an hour or so, when none of us knows what to do any longer,
I get up and I leave.
My point is being made, that I want to see him badly, right?
That must mean something.
How many gringos... have acted that dramatically toward him ever?
And whether or not he could respond in any meaningful way doesn't matter.
He would think of it as a dramatic macho act.
Oh, shit. Shh.
No. Look, no-- I'm not--
I'm not Immigration.
Yo no migras.
Qué--No. N-No. No-- Shh!
No, wait. Wait.
It's okay.
I'm not the Immigration.
All right?
It's a mistake.
Shh! No! W--
What the hell are you doin' out there?
Look, I'm just looking for some
--Get off of there!
I was looking for some friends of mine.
Get off of there!
I got the wrong apartment. It's a mista--
Don't you remember me from the store?
Goddamn sleazeball.
Get out of here! Get!
Okay, I'm leaving.
I'm going, all right?
It was a mistake.
I'm sorry.
J-Just--
Damn!
I think there was one kid.
He moved out this morning.
Do they know that I'm here because
I'm in love with the boy?
Why would a gringo be here?
Who would he be looking for?
A junk dealer?
A whore? A queer?
Well, at least I tried.
Excuse me. Have you seen a guy come in here, a Mexican kid?
He's about this tall, he's got long hair, he's wearing a-- a jean jacket and jeans... and, like, a plaid shirt, and he's got boots--
I seen a lot of-- a lot of Mexicans coming in here.
It's, like, Saturday and Sunday we were so close, and then, phfft-- it's all over.
I really thought he was starting to like me.
But I guess not.
Just another fantasy.
Or maybe we can only communicate to a certain point.
I've always had that problem with you.
I go to the Grecian Gardens raving, "Johnny's gone."
I have a couple of beers and tell my old buddy George... about the impossibilities of love.
So, is he gonna come back and get you, or what?
No sé.
Where did they go? Thanks.
What do you need? No sé.
Maybe Idaho.
Um, get me a big bottle of Night Train.
All right. A big one.
And a pack of Pall Malls.
$2.60-- Buck and a quarter.
Well, I can't believe that they just took off and left you here.
You sure he's coming back?
What do you need?
Hey, you can't bring that cart in here!
Take that out. Take that out!
- I'll take it out.
- Yeah, right.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It's worth about two bucks.
I don't--
I can't use it, though.
Yeah. Veinticinco.
Veinticinco.
Right. That's the price tag.
That's what people pay in the store for it.
But it's worthless unless you want a pot like this.
Por tú, quince pesos.
But it's not worth anything unless you happen to want a pot like this, and then you go into the store and get it.
I can't do anything with it.
Don't you have a place to stay?
No.
You're welcome to stay at my place.
No sé eso.
No, no, it, um-- We'll have a beer.
This is my amigo-- my friend Pepper.
¿Habla español?
Okay, Pepper, this is-- this is Esther, and this is Mike.
Hi. Mucho gusto.
This is Frank the homophobe here.
That's Henry,
Hannah Duncan, Betty,
Don Chambers-- the incredible
Mr. Don Chambers--
Yeah. This is Sharon, and this is Marty.
Marty the poet.
Marty the poet extraordinaire.
Right?
You're never gonna remember that.
How can you remember one name to 40 names, huh?
The deal with Marty is--
¿Qué es tu problema?
Tú es muy serio.
¿Preocupado?
¿Qué es tu problema?
No problema.
So-- ¿Qué tal?
No.
I'm off.
Hasta luego.
Hasta luego.
Fuck it.
Do I need him that badly?
Am I that desperate?
Of course I am.
Okay, you wanna pick up a couple extra dollars?
You go up to this club, okay?
It's up on Fifth Street.
You go up there, be nice to the guys, they'll pay you a little bit. All right?
Okay? Got that?
If that don't work out for you, you go up to another club up on Sixth Street.
Just about a block up.
Go down about a half a block, okay?
Do some nude dancing, maybe, pick up a couple extra dollars, no problem there.
If nothing like that works out for you, go talk to a guy named Bill. Okay?
He'll take care of you.
Just be nice to him.
He'll do everything for you.
All right? That's all you gotta do. You got that?
You understand what I'm saying?
Okay.
A poor Mexican has a snowball's chance in hell, man.
It's because disaster is right around that corner.
Hope Johnny comes back.
Look, take care of yourself, man.
Come by the store and I'll give you some cough medicine, all right?
Look, I wanna be your friend, your amigo.
I'll help you any way I can.
Wait a minute.
Take care of yourself, all right?
Gracias. Hasta luego.
What do you want?
What?
Look, Juan, we can't go driving now.
Later. Después.
Is Johnny back?
Shit.
Hola.
Hi.
♪ Adiós, adiós ♪
Everything comes out beautifully with Spray 'n' Starch.
Hey.
Pizza, taco, burrito.
Comida-- ¿Cómo se llama--
Mil-- Milk shake.
¡Ándale!
Hello!
Hello?
Howdy.
My friend's looking for work. Do you know if there's any work?
I remember your friend from last year.
He's a good worker.
But you guys came at the wrong time of the year.
It's the wrong season.
And I'm not really the guy to talk to.
We don't really have a lot of work right now.
¿Dónde vas?
What are you doing?
What's that stuff?
What is that? Es por granos.
Granos.
¿Qué es tu problema?
Granos. Granos.
¿Granos? No me molesto.
¿En su boca? ¡Por favor, no me molesto!
Para.
Pobrecito.
¿Me lo hago? ¡Para!
Come on. Oh.
Para, para. No me molesto.
Hey!
¡No más! ¡Para!
Pendejo.
H-Hold--
¡No más! ¡No más! Pendejo.
All right, stop!
Stop! Hey!
Look! Wait!
Look, all r--
Hey! Alto.
Go.
Puto.
Tú eres un pendejo.
He only wants to have sex at night, not during the day.
And certain aggressive acts-- that's what he wants and needs.
That's not what I want.
I mean, I'm not an invert.
His sexual desires are very stereotypical, and mine aren't.
These buggers.
Little varmints.
Shh-shh-shh-shh.
I love the countryside here.
This is great.
You're doing good.
You're doing real good.
This is your first curve coming up right up here.
It's your first one.
Do you see it?
Now, all you're gonna want to do is turn to the left.
It's real easy.
All right, get ready.
See it there?
Okay, turn-- Turn-- No, turn--
Turn the car! Turn--
What are you doing?
Turn the car!
Why would-- Look!
What? All you had to do was turn the car!
What did you do?
Shit! You drive like you fuck!
Get--
How--
It's a simple little thing.
All you had to do was turn the car.
Thanks a lot.
For $300, the Ebony store gift certificate.
Okay, that is-- What?
That is 401.
I can't help feeling that his well-being... depends on Johnny coming back.
I know he accepts me and that we're friends, but...
Johnny may have been arrested.
He says one of their friends told him that he saw him in the back of a police car.
So, your grandfather sent you out for milk?
Es pepino.
That's a cucumber.
Cucumber. Cucumber.
Cu... cum-- cumber?
They make pickles out of 'em.
Leche.
Mm-hmm.
Huevos.
Huevos.
Right.
We're gonna have some beans.
No sé ése. No sé ése.
Garbanzo beans. Sí.
Shall we put 'em in the-- in the tortilla?
Tortillas aquí. Tortillas aquí. Sí.
Manteca.
Butter. Margarine.
It's not margarine. It's shit.
And Pepper has girlfriends too.
I don't think he likes me that much.
I don't blame him.
We're just not compatible.
But why isn't it easy for them?
I mean, they don't have any imagination about sex or anything else, like fantasies or erotic friendship.
Friendship?
I guess it's not their fault.
Let me in. Let me in.
Who is it?
It's me, Polly. Let me in.
What do you want now?
There's a guy-- There's a weird guy upstairs.
H-He followed me in.
Wh-What guy?
Did you look?
There is a guy who makes Son of Sam look like Tweety Bird.
We've gotta call the cops.
He's a derelict, man.
We gotta call the cops.
All right, I'll call the cops.
But, look, you handle it.
Okay. I will. You talk to 'em.
I don't want anything to do with this.
All right, all right.
Hey! Let me in.
Wait a minute.
Oh, I like it!
You must love that flavor. I've never had that.
Officer 2, where is the Code 5?
Barney's, 14th and Davis.
14th and Division? Davis.
Horton, are you there?
We'll be out talking to him.
Freeze, or you're wallpaper!
Second man down.
He'll be on the northeast corner.
That's a man down.
He's on the northeast corner--
They're people like we are.
I found out they call him Papas, not Pepper, because he likes to eat papas-- or french fries.
El Loco Papas is smart like a fox, staying off by himself, but they got him anyway.
These kids shouldn't be out on the street, man.
They get into trouble that way, man.
Dealing marijuana--
The cops are gonna get him, man. You know that.
Jesus Christ.
It ain't fair, but--
Hello, everybody, goddamn it.
Señor.
Amigo-- Mexico.
I'm gonna have to boot your ass out of here pretty soon if you don't mellow out.
Go ahead. Make me go--
Watch out.
Sorry.
All right.
Love a--Love a duck.
You see?
So, what I told him was the story about the lady with one in her bedside stand.
I said, "What the fuck is that?"
And she said,
"That's for burglars."
And I said, "You will not blow a burglar away with that.
You'll blow him into little pieces."
And she said,
"That's what it's for, George."
Okay, great.
Everybody knows that?
Looking for Johnny,
I saw no sign.
I think they got you too.
You have no place to go or to hide.
I don't know what's gonna happen to you.
Or, Ido know what's gonna happen to you, and so do you, probably.
And that's why
I fell in love with Johnny in the first place.
And that's why Roberto was silent most of the time and chased white butt-- if you know what I mean-- hoping some of that sticky good comfort, luck and security might rub off on him.
Or at least he could make it squeal.
Are you all right?
Hey!
Are you all right?
Man, don't be afraid.
I'm your friend.
Hey, assholes!
Shut the fuck up down there!
I'm tryin' to get some sleep!
Give me a break!
I gotta work for a living, huh?
- Damn!
- Johnny!
Hey! Johnny!
Hey! What happened to you?
They didn't get you.
Were you in Idaho?
Shit!
So, come on.
Tell me what happened.
All this time we think
Johnny's on vacation in Idaho.
Well, it seems that the Immigration picked him up, they captured him, and they shipped him back to the border, not to Idaho.
Swimming the Rio Grande by moonlight, he's back in less than two weeks.
He rode the rails, hopped the freights.
¡Toro! ¡Toro, muchacho!
¡Olé! ¡Olé!
¡Toro! ¡Toro!
Whoa!
The police came.
I told you to get rid of that gun.
How you doing?
Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you.
Hey!
I'm thinking of leaving for Anchorage tomorrow.
What's in Anchorage?
I can do nude dancing in just about any bar in town and make 150 bucks a night.
Why do you wanna do--
Look!
I can't believe he's there.
Hey, hey! What are you doing?
Hey, come down to the store and see me sometime.
All right?
Come-- Come down to the store and talk to me. All right?

(HORN, LOUD SIREN)
Here, Mrs Flora.
Ooh.
Thank you. Bless you, Rita.
Now he's had his boosters, you can take him to the park so he can play with his friends.
And, if you ask Amanda nicely, she'll give him a treat cos he's been brave.
All right?
Go on!
Er, Myra Nicholson?
That's me.
But, er, you can call me Steve.
Hello, Myra.
There we go.
OK.
19's a good age, but her heart's given out.
We should put her to sleep to spare her suffering.
I hadn't realised how long I'd...
Do you need a moment?
No, it's fine.
I hadn't expected to...
(CAT MEOWS)
Bloody cat!
You know, she resented me from the start.
I'm sorry.
(PHONE BEEPS)
_
Ah.
(GROANING AND SHOUTING)
I'm off now, Mrs Flora.
Oh, goodnight.
- Buona notte. - Buona notte. I left shepherd's pie and broccoli for you.
I turn it down so it doesn't dry out.
- Oh, you spoil me.
- Oh!
Home at last, Adam.
Night, Rita. All good with my granny?
Same old, same old.
Well, you could take the food out of the oven.
I love your plate warmer.
What? Don't you mock me!
It's generational.
My generation has toast racks and plate warmers and yours has double espresso machines and dating apps.
How do you know about dating apps?
Oh, you know. Rita's my Google.
By the way, that jacket needs to go to the dry cleaners -
- something on the shoulder.
- Really?
On the back.
I do hope this is all right.
She always over-seasons.
Oh!
You're looking a bit flushed.
It's, er, it's London.
Hm. You're like me. I hate crowds.
Am I like you?
Of course you are.
Dinner with Claudie next week, before her twins arrive.
Oh!
Well, she'll make a better mother than I ever did.
You did all right with me.
I was lucky. Fate gave me a second chance.
My bridge cronies always asking me,
"When is he going to settle down?" and I say to them, "You know, some of us prefer our own company."
That's what I tell them.
(WATER RUNS)
(PHONE BEEPS)
(RINGING)
(CLICK)
Hi. It's-it's Adam again, from the vet's.
I've brought...
(BUZZER)
(LIFT DINGS)
You'd better come in.
Oh, hi. I was expecting Steve.
Of course you were. But I'm Caspar.
Do you live here, too?
I do, rather.
Oh, is that, er..?
Yes. I'm sorry it had to happen when you were away.
Hm.
Well, I have to nip to the post but you'll find Steve in his study in need of distraction.
Hello?
You can't leave them there.
Oh, hi.
Caspar would have a fit.
Sorry, I...
I just thought I'd drop off
Myra's ashes, er, on my way home.
I thought the box was quite nice.
Yeah, but it's not Biedermeier.
Caspar's been known to change hotels if the carpet upsets him.
Er, what are you working on?
A redesign of a perfect flat in Limehouse.
All my work gets undone.
I mean, if you heal a dog, right, it stays healed.
Er, unhappy people can have persistently unhappy pets.
So you're an architect?
No, erm... Caspar swept me off my feet before I qualified.
This place is really quite nice.
Your ten-minute call.
I'm sorry, erm...
So, Tracy and thingy want more bubbly, and Gavin wants another glass of that stuff he likes.
OK. Who's "thingy" ?
You know, the one with the...
- Hey.
- Hey!
- You are vast.
- I'm a whale. Twins. Nightmare.
- What am I saying? It's brilliant!
- It suits you.
Well, thank God it turns him on because it's made me so horny.
So, erm...
What?
I wanted to see you properly, but I've done that thing again.
I thought it was just going to be us.
Yeah, I know, but there's someone
I want you to meet.
Hi, David.
His name is Dwight, he teaches drama.
(CHATTER)
So, Adrian.
Adam.
Yeah. How do you know David?
Er, I... Claudie was my girlfriend at uni.
Oh. Oh, but I thought you were...
Yeah, I am.
I turned him.
I love how relaxed you Brits are.
I was told you'd be all uptight and judgemental.
And two doubles with an overtrick.
Oh, that's, erm...
Oh, I can't work it out.
Oh, with all this excitement,
I've just got to pee.
They've been on two dates now!
What, to the theatre?
No, to a hotel.
She's on some pills.
It certainly helps her card play.
I don't understand.
I was... It was such a relief, when I could quietly give up.
But your Michael died so young.
No, he was 60.
Yes, but...
Oh, I'm just not wired that way.
Never have been.
_
_
_
_
Hey!
Hey.
We've hardy spoken.
Yeah, er, will you make my apologies, this is my round.
No, it's me you apologise to.
He better be worth it. Let me see.
Yeah, and his face?
Oh!
Oh, yeah, he's hotter than Dwight.
That voice!
It'd be like sleeping with a chainsaw.
Sorry.
I worry about you. That could be anyone.
Is that the cock of a serial killer?
This is so not OK.
You are leaving a table of friends just to fuck a complete stranger.
You used to envy me and now you're judging.
Hell, yes, I'm judging. It's not cool.
It's just weird.
I will give you a full report.
I'm not sure I want you to be godfather.
(PHONE BEEPS)
(PANTING AND GRUNTING)
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry, sorry.
Yeah. This...
You're-You're very passionate.
Oh, sorry.
No, no, no, don't be stupid. It was hot.
What did you say your name was again?
Oh, I didn't.
Oh, well, I-I'm Bruno.
Hello, Bruno.
I'd like to do that again.
Anything's possible.
Sorry, but, er, after that,
I need to go and use the bathroom.
So just, er, play some music, will you, or something?
Where've you gone now?
Just fixing your router.
Oh, can't it wait?
Almost done.
Well, it's really kind of you to get all that kit for me, but, I mean, apart from e-mails,
I never use the internet.
I know. But I do.
Now, then, you sit down.
Eat, while it's still warm.
OK.
Oh, no, not again.
She puts chilli in, all the time.
Poor Rita. It's fine.
So, something important, you said.
Um, from the letting agents.
They're not going ahead with the cottage.
Says it's too much work to be done to be lettable.
So, I want to give you that cottage now, rather than you have it later.
You know, it's good for a man to have a project and it'll get you out of the city.
(HE SIGHS)
God. Wow.
- Thank you.
- Hm.
Thank you!
Oh, come on, there you go, eat while it's still warm, please.
You're a good boy, Merlin, all right, bye-bye.
Hello, Steve.
Yes. Yes, it is.
Er, look, erm, this is really unprofessional, but...
(FOOTSTEPS)
So, they never actually put central heating in, which is amazing!
There's a proper hole in one of the bedroom floors.
I should probably just sell it, as is.
No, no, no, it's brilliant.
You just have to dig past all the crap.
You... you can't sell.
You're not seeing it. Oh...
So, erm, was it like your parents' weekend cottage, or...?
No. We never came here.
Perhaps Flora did before she let it, but I... really don't know.
Right who's... who's Flora ?
Oh, my grandmother. Christ.
All this depressing junk!
(CLANKING)
- Oh, that's nice.
- You see?
I'd really, really like to do a job like this, Adam.
It's like working on a site with my brothers when I was growing up.
The whole hands-on...
I'm bored of tarting up kitchens!
What would Caspar think of you working outside of London?
Well, we're not joined at the hip and, er, and he's in Brighton with his latest app-squeeze.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
You don't mind?
I don't own him.
What?
Do you mind kissing me?
(BACKGROUND NOISE FADES TO SILENCE)
(ADAM SIGHS)
Oh...
Am I, er...
- ..am I barking up the wrong tree?
- No. No.
Whoa!
What?
Well, it's not a porn film, I...
Listen, Adam, there's a person in these jeans, OK?
I can't...
(HE BREATHES HEAVILY)
I can't.
This is... I'm sorry.
Sorry. Did I misread...?
I should sell the place.
It's such a lot of work.
Oh.
OK.
- I'll make my own way from here.
- Really?
Yeah.
I'll pay for your time.
Whatever.
I'll wait!
Adam? How did it go?
You were late back.
I... I took a designer friend with me for a second opinion and, er, he likes it, but I...
So, is your instinct, what, to sell?
Probably.
- Oh, that's a shame.
- I'd better get on.
Perhaps we could...
Scooby's ashes are here when you want to collect them, OK?
All right, bye-bye.
Look, I know you want to sell, but I couldn't stop thinking of all you could do there.
Can I show you?
Erm, not here. Erm, we've a backlog from this morning.
I finish at five. Erm, er...
There's a cafe down the street.
Er, could you please get me Amy's profile?
I wasn't sure you'd come.
I owe you an apology.
For the weekend. I...
It doesn't matter. It was my fault, I...
Anyway...
Do what you like with these.
May even help you to sell it if you can get someone to see past the hideous wallpaper... I'm talking too much.
Sorry.
I'll shut up.
These are beautiful. Seriously.
Thank you.
I was a prat on Sunday.
I'm not used to, erm...
..you know.
No, but...
Er, thanks for doing these.
I don't know what I want to do with the cottage, but I should pay you.
That's fine. Erm...
They're a present.
Call me, er...
..if you change your mind, or whatever.
Coffee ?
Thanks.
I saw Adam Berryman again today.
I want to do that cottage, Caspar.
Well, what about Hugo's new place?
Hugo needs therapy, not new taps.
It'll be a great opportunity for me.
But countryside, country people...
You're probably right to sell it.
Gin!
Gin again.
Who did you go with?
A friend I made through work.
Steve.
_
(PHONE CLICKS)
Hi.
Hey, boss.
- Someone's happy.
- Like you wouldn't believe!
I'm not redesigning another high-end kitchen.
I'm in heaven!
So...
You skiving?
Er...
Saturday surgery is only short and they owe me so much leave.
Good.
(PHONE BEEPS)
Mr Popular.
Trust me.
Living with Caspar, I could write a thesis on sex addiction.
So... was your dad tough on you?
Erm, let's just say his model of masculinity wasn't exactly lord Berners.
You've no idea who that is.
(LAUGHS) No.
Just tell me that you can't explain the offside rule.
If you're closer to your opponents' goal line than both the ball and...
I so had you there.
(ADAM LAUGHS)
Bitch!
If beds could talk, eh?
I'm sure this had a quiet and blameless life.
It's getting late.
I should go.
Well, I got a lot more done with you here, so...
It's only Sunday tomorrow.
Or do you have a hot date?
That old sofa, erm, folds out into a bed, of sorts.
Oh, this is so good. How did you...?
Pepper, salt, lemon...
It's just steak!
Do you both cook?
What?
Sorry. Erm, yes, we both enjoy cooking when we're in.
Thanks. We go out... a lot.
Do you mind me asking you all these questions?
I never get a chance to...
Stick around long enough to make conversation?
I'm sorry. That was mean.
Erm...
You're not even out, are you?
I bet you've still not told your granny.
Oh, Flora is so not a granny.
Not in so many words. She's...
..she's never invited confidences.
And you're scared she'd...
I, erm... I-I-I don't know.
Is that rain?
No.
This is nice.
Yeah.
- Steve.
- Yeah? - It's a picture.
- Yeah. - No. erm, you have grease on your hands.
Oh.
You're better off just blowing.
Close your eyes.
One, two, three.
Wow.
(HE SIGHS)
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Adam, can I come in?
Hm, come in.
Now, erm...
No, you're... you're going to spoil your appetite if you eat all this.
Oh, no, I've been working so hard all weekend, I'm starving.
Steve has a real vision for how we can...
Now, doesn't he have a life in London?
Er, no. Well, it's complicated.
He has Caspar.
Erm, an art dealer, but they're what
Steve calls semidetached, so...
(SHE LAUGHS)
I have to show you this.
We found it in the cupboard.
I thought it was really rather lovely, you know.
It might have been...
I don't remember that.
It must have belonged to the Brewers.
Well, it's addressed to you and Grandpa.
"To Flora and Michael
"in the hope the enclosed might one day hang
"in your drawing room.
"Thomas."
Who was Thomas?
Oh, he was a friend of your grandfather's.
But we didn't like the picture and, erm, we put it away, chucked it out.
Why did you just pretend that you...?
I can forgive.
Hm... It's how you're made.
I wish you would be discreet, but of course, that's my age.
What?
You and the man.
There's nothing between...
There's nothing...
Well, I never expected when
I gave you the cottage that you'd turn it into somewhere that you'd bring your latest...
- Stop. - ..pick-up.
- Just stop, right there.
- You're using your father's money...
- Just stop!
I'm 34 years old.
And I'm still hiding in your basement.
Is it any wonder...?
It's no business of yours who I fuck.
I don't need to hear this.
I'm sorry. Silly of me to forget that anything below the neck disgusts you!
I mean, do you ever lose control?
- What do you mean?
- Well, did you ever need to give yourself...
I loved your grandfather!
Yes, but passion!
Yes!
I loved him!
With passion!
Shit!
All right. You win.
I've been ashamed... all my life.
- And I wonder why that was!
- Yes, you should be ashamed.
Because it is terrible, it's disgusting to live with other people, as if you were animals.
Animals?
Yes! ANIMALS!
Argh!
I always feel as if I'm in the wrong. It's not fair.
(RINGING)
Come on, Steve, come on.

Look. Deleted it.
It's just going to feel weird me... me paying you...
No. You're just humping the help.
- I will tell you when it gets weird.
- Yeah?
The trouble with open relationships is they don't end with a satisfying, plate-smashing row.
They just become about coffee beans and cat litter.
Yeah.
He is so inexperienced.
Oh, is that what they call it nowadays?
You know what I mean.
(CASPAR CHUCKLES)
Just promise me you don't think you can save him from himself.
You saved me.
You just needed pointing in the right direction.
Oh, it was a lovely send-off - perfect music and readings by all the grandchildren.

You're lucky Adam's so close.

You didn't tell me you were inviting Flora.
Flora!
Hi!
Hello.
I'm sorry, I should have rung.
D-Don't be silly.
It's good to see you.
Yes.
I came to bring you this.
Well, it belongs here. With you.
Thank you.
Come and meet Steve.
They're so sweet when they're new.
When they're sleeping.
Or they've just been fed, yeah.
(THEY LAUGH)
Steve's a honey.
- You must be really glad Adam's finally met someone. - Hm.
He's very...
I-I'm trying to adjust,
Claudie, I can't turn overnight into a liberal.
This is rather good, you know.
March has become very collectable.
Oh, I see.
I wish I hadn't told Michael to throw away his painting.
So how well did you know Thomas March?
Not at all well.
They were at school together and in the Army.
"To Flora and Michael, in the hope that one day the enclosed
"might hang in your drawing room."
What was enclosed with it?
Oh, Thomas was probably drunk.
He must have meant the painting.
Can I have some wine?
Yes, of course.
Would you mind? I think there's something peculiar about the frame.
- There is?
- Something odd going on.
And it's just a hunch.
Oh, my goodness.
Yeah. There's definitely a second painting under there.
(WHISTLING)
It's Grandpa, isn't it?
(SHE WHIMPERS)
Hey, it's OK. Hey...
Here.
I thought I'd won.
Won what?
His love.
But Thomas March loved Michael, and Michael loved Thomas March.
Grandpa was gay.
Yes.
Grandpa was gay.
He loved me, but he married me to be like everybody else.
How did you find out?
Oh, his love letters.
They were beautiful.
And I burnt them.
You burnt them?
I was angry and scared that
Michael would be sent to prison.
Thomas was.
I thought I'd won.
I ruined both of their lives.
They hurt you, too.
(WHISPERS) Yes.
I wish I'd known him.
Oh, thank you.
Could you ever imagine...
What?
..having kids with me?
I so could.
I got so broody today with those twins around.
Me, too.
Thanks for making today so special.
Teamwork.
(PHONE BEEPS)
I'm so sorry. It's just I...
Wished you'd left it on silent?
I did delete it.
Yeah, but then you put it...
Steve, it's a habit.
I didn't... I haven't...
OK.
Steve? Steve!
Hey, Steve, come on! Steve?!
(PHONE BEEPS)
Shit!
(SHOUTS) Shit!
(HE BREATHES HEAVILY)
My God, are you all right?
What's happened ?
What's happened? Are you hurt?
- (HE SOBS)
- Come on.
Come on now. Now, let's sit down.
Here we go. There we go.
I'm sorry. He left me.
Oh...
It's all my fault.
It's all my fucking-around fault.
Weren't you... weren't you happy together?
I've never been so happy in my life.
Oh, you must go after him.
You can't lose him.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry for waking you.
No. I'm glad you came to me.
I just thought of something.
I-I thought of something.
I'd forgotten all about it until I-I saw the painting.
Erm, here.
When I thought I was losing Michael, oh, I fought like a tigress.
To get him back, I was all ferocity.
Oh, I was. There was no pride.
Now, this is a letter your grandfather Michael wrote, he never sent it.
I found it after he died.
Well, you'll see. I want you to keep it.
Keep everything.
And, you know, whatever happens,
I know that your grandfather Michael and Thomas would have been very, very proud of you.
Oh, darling.
Thank you.
(HE SIGHS)
(HE CLEARS THROAT)
"My darling Thomas. I'm at work.
"Nobody knows I'm writing to you here.
"You refuse my visits,
"so you're probably tearing up my letters, too.
"But there's nothing else I can do but keep trying.
"It's beyond my control, do you see?
"All those months ago, when I had nothing to lose, really,
"I wrote to you in my head
"but was too cowardly to set more than lies on paper.
"And now, I find I no longer care.
"The love I feel for you runs through me like grain through wood.
"I love you, Thomas.
"Your face, your voice, your touch
"enter my mind at the least opportune moments
"and I find I have no power to withstand them.
"No desire to.
"I want us to be together, as we were in the cottage.
"Only for ever, not just a weekend.
"I want it to go on so long that it feels normal.
"I think of you constantly.
"Your face, your breath on my neck at night.
"I want to do all the ordinary,
"un-bedroomy things we never got around to doing.
"Making toast. Raking leaves.
"Sitting in silence.
"I love you, Thomas.
"I've always loved you.
"I see that now.
"Tell me I'm not too late."

# Man.in.an.Orange.Shirt.S01E01.720p.BluRay.x264-SHORTBREHD.srt
I didn't know you owned a cottage.
Why did you two never live there?
I visited once, but I never cared for it.
Anyway, it was your grandfather's.
It was really all very basic.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, dear.
My dear Flora, your photograph is getting pretty battered with all the travelling around in my breast pocket.
I can't tell you where we are or much of what we're doing, of course.
Much of the countryside is so beautiful that I have to remind the men that we're not here on holiday.
But then, merry hell breaks out again.
I'll spare you the details.
Aim at the olive groves, until the others get through to relieve us.
Yes sir!
Bastards got the supply lorry before it could get through the gates, sir!
It's the driver, sir - another dead one and they shot out the tyres.
Everybody out with the others, quickly!
We need the MO!
I think this one's still with us, sir!
- The MO's dead.
Put him with the rest.
Quickly!
Not another!
He was in the back with the supplies!
Christ.
Set him down gently.
I need you back at the gatehouse.
We can't have the others ambushed, do you understand?
Sir!
Don't just sit there, help him!
Sugar.
Our lives full of bloody sugar.
March.
Thomas March!
March, stay with me.
Stay with me!
March!
Captain.
You were lucky.
Your lot saved my life.
This...
This was your lifesaver.
I need to get your sketch pads back from our CO; he's not exactly artistic.
Berryman!
Was I a beast to you at school?
Berryman!
Actually you were always very kind.
What a relief.
Berryman, a word.
Yes, sir.
- Almost! Left, left! Oi!
- Watch it, watch it!
Come on, come on, get stuck in!
♪ I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart
Who are you writing to?
Oh, a girl back home, Flora.
She's a teacher.
Oh.
I've known her all my life.
She's almost like a sister.
Not entirely.
She lost her parents in an air raid.
Just like me.
Almost there...
Goal!
Goal!
Listen up, men.
This is Captain March.
He's an official war artist.
Now you're not to mind him drawing you.
His work is good for morale.
Sir.
Sir, is it true that the Hun lay on tarts for their soldiers?
Yeah, how come they get tarts and we get artists?
It's the morale back home that art can raise.
It's for your wives and girlfriends, your children.
Don't let them cheek you..
Sir?
Go on, sir.
Paint me.
Put it away, Bates.
But he's raising my morale, sir.
Bates will drive you to rendezvous point and then you'll be driven back down to work from there.
How far to the Handover?
An hour at least.
Depending on the state of the road.
Well in that case, nature calls.
Are we likely to come under fire?
Hopefully not.
Save fuel, men.
As you were, please.
The area should have been cleared.
It's bloody embarrassing, but I can't... button my fly single handed.
Promise me that you'll come and find me?
I mean it.
Captain.
Captain Berryman!
You ought to be off, sir.
Rendezvous time's not that long away.
Of course Bates, good man.
Thank you, Bates.
Good luck.
What's so amusing, Travis?
Patroclus, miss.
Patroclus and Achilles,
I don't understand.
Your closest friend is butchered in a battle in which he wore your armour because you disdained to fight.
You lament.
Perfectly understandable.
But they're not just friends are they?
Greek for friendship? Wickham?
Agape, miss.
Love between heroes was regarded as surpassing the love between marriage, but, in Sparta's...
Class rise.
Miss Talbot, boys.
We have just heard that Mr Churchill has accepted Germany's surrender.
The war in Europe is at an end.
You may cheer, boys.
No more bloody war!
Hello.
Are you lost?
I was looking for Captain March.
Perhaps I have his address wrong.
No, no, he has the studio upstairs.
We share an entrance.
Oh.
I don't bite, unless you pay extra.
I'm Lucian: landlord, watchdog, purveyor of shade to the gentry.
Who are you?
My name is Berryman, Michael Berryman.
Enter, Michael Berryman.
You came.
We were only demobbed from Colchester this morning.
If it's not convenient...
Don't be silly. Its...
Er...
So what are your plans?
For the rest of the evening?
Bugger all.
Good.
What about...
Sorry, I've forgotten her name.
Flora.
Flora Talbot.
She doesn't know I'm back yet.
Left here.
Left!
I haven't been here since my parents died.
I should've written.
I'm a coward.
I wrote to you in my head every bloody day but I...
I wrote to you.
Really?
Nothing ever got through.
I never said I posted them.
Tea!
Very old tea.
Fuck, the floor is cold.
I also found... an unopened tin of shortbread.
It must be pre-war.
Good morning March.
Captain.
Thank you so much.
You haven't mentioned her all week.
It's scarcely appropriate.
Do you love her?
I...
You'll love her too.
How cosy.
Please, Thomas.
I don't understand how you can be so matter of fact.
Does she love you?
I imagine so or she wouldn't have agreed to marry me.
Please say yes, Thomas.
Say you'll be there at least please.
I have no family.
I don't want to be your bloody family.
I...
Please.
You have no idea have you?
What about, Thomas?
You surely didn't think that we could set up house together like man and wife.
Please.
Just be quiet.
Let's just go back to London.
Nearly there.
I'm so glad you wore Mummy's brooch.
Bloody hell.
You are not to cry.
Oh, there he is.
Thomas!
Hello.
You must be...
Daphne, older sister.
Matron of honour and all that.
Thomas March, how do you do?
Michael says you're an artist. How very romantic.
Hardly.
Flora, how do you do?
Hello, Thomas.
You look wonderful.
Worth the wait.
Thank you.
Sorry that I couldn't come to your supper party.
I'm horribly unsociable when I'm working.
Talking of which.
I brought you something, a wedding present.
That's so sweet.
We should probably...
Yes.
Michael.
- Yes.
You came.
Of course I came.
Fucking best man has to.
If any man or woman knows just cause or impediment why these two should not be joined together let him now speak or else hereafter forever hold his peace.
Do you, Michael Sadler Berryman, take Flora Agnes Talbot to be your wedded wife?
I do.
It seems wrong having no one in tears.
I don't think we...
Compliments of Mr March, sir.
Thomas, you shouldn't have.
You can't get married and not have bubbles.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, the bride and groom.
Bless you, Thomas.
Please, no speeches anyone, or I shall cry.
You're really not having a honeymoon?
We haven't a bean until Michael's salary from the bank comes through.
We used pretty much all of our savings on a deposit for the flat.
So not even a weekend in your cottage?
Oh...
Oh, dear.
Not until it has a boiler, a new bathroom, and no mice.
The flat is darling though, right on the park.
You must come for supper.
Yes, you must.
Apparently, Thomas's pad in Soho was unreconstructed Hogarth.
How marvellous.
Not really.
So, won't you miss your teaching?
Hardly.
All those dirty-minded little boys.
Ahh, food.
Daphne could eat a horse.
Naughty.
Thanks so much Thomas, for everything.
You, er...
You've been brilliant.
Haven't I?
Thomas I...
Thomas I, er...
I really...
What?
What, what do you really?
I just...
Just give us a bloody minute will you?!
Of course.
You don't have to go through with this.
Of course I do.
If you have either sense or decency, you'll do the same.
Well, I'll go and settle up.
You're perfection.
I feel a bit of a fraud.
Oh, darling.
You'll be fine.
You'll see.
I bet he's a real goer.
But sensitive with it.
It's...
What?
Tell me.
It's a lot nicer if he lets you ride up top.
I'm told it gets better.
Yes.
I heard that too.
Mrs Berryman.
Actually, do you mind just...
Oh, of course, sorry.
Now if I snore, you're to throw a book at me.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Back to work, Berryman.
So who else should we invite?
If we simply have Daphne and this new chap of hers.
Poor man will feel he's being auditioned.
Well isn't he?
She rather implied she'd already auditioned him and he'd passed with flying colours.
Sorry, what was that?
I was miles away.
I said who else should we invite?
Well I ran into Richard Tremayne at Blackfriars the other day.
You know, from the regiment.
We could have him and his wife.
What about poor Thomas?
We haven't seen him since the wedding.
Daphne thought he was a bit of all right and he has all sorts of eager spinsters lined up for him.
No, I don't think so.
Why ever not?
Well he's not terribly sociable really.
He'd only be a dead weight.
And you can tell Daphne he's a confirmed bachelor.
She'd only take that as a personal challenge.
Daphne.
Thank God, I'm starving.
Me too.
Oh, of course you are!
My darling, how many weeks to go?
Two or three.
Ooh.
Let's find you a nice bench.
Such a drama this morning.
Phil Gladstone.
Which is he?
Victorian watercolours and china.
Lives with his mother.
He was arrested first thing this morning.
No, why?
It turns out he was also living with the man upstairs.
One of their neighbours had sneaked and the police showed up at dawn and caught them together, in bed.
Will he go to prison?
Almost certainly.
And Bill has a prior history of gross indecency.
Which isn't as bad as buggery but it's almost as bad.
No more handling Lady
Downing's bristols for him.
Gross indecency; you mean... exposing himself?
No, you know.
Public lavatories.
Oh.
Now darling, tell. You sounded all shaky when you rang.
I was quite worried.
It was nothing.
Hormones running riot, probably.
Making me feel like a caged beast.
It is good to see you.
You know you can tell me.
You can tell me anything.
I know.
But, it's nothing.
Everything's fine.
Well, this is nice.
I'm sorry.
Darling, I was miles away.
And you've gone to so much trouble and in your condition.
Time on my hands.
I tidied your desk this morning.
Why?
I needed some ink and it was full of junk in there.
Hope I didn't throw out anything precious.
Well, I'm a hoarder.
You'll reform me yet.
Where's Thomas's painting?
I took it down, I rather hate it.
Well perhaps I could take it to the cottage so you...
Your precious cottage, you'd love that wouldn't you?
Pudding's only pears, I'm afraid.
Oh, God.
Take this fucking thing.
What should I...
I don't want it under our roof another night, it's repellent.
Yes.
I mean, what are you?
Are you safe around children?
What were you thinking marrying me?!
Do you even love me?!
If I'm expected to lie around bringing forth like some brood mare, while the two of you...
Ah..!
Darling, darling, sit down.
Don't touch me!
Never touch me!
You're disgusting!
Criminal!
Mr Berryman.
Oh, thank God.
It's this way.
You came just in time.
Go and have a drink, Mr Berryman.
It'll be hours yet.
And it's all woman's work from here on in.
Ooh..! So sorry.
Let me put those in water.
Thank you.
There's not much on offer this time of year, even in Covent Garden.
You went all that way?
They're lovely, I like white roses.
He's sweet.
A bit soon to tell.
Eager feeder, though... but it hurts like hell.
I thought maybe Robert, after your father.
And James for mine.
Darling, I'm so...
I am far, far too tired to talk about it.
Would you like to hold him?
He's asleep.
Perhaps we should just leave him.
No, pick him up, please.
I want the father of my child
- I really... to hold his son.
Hold his head.
So you like it?
What?
The name.
Robert James.
Yes, yes, it's perfect, perfect.
Did you light a cigar?
Certainly not.
It took me several weeks to track you down.
How?
Your boss and I go back a long long way.
But he's...
He's married with children.
There's a lot of it about.
Thomas is in prison.
Why?
The usual.
Cottaging.
Oh Christ, he really can pick 'em.
Gross indecency, dear.
One year.
You must visit him.
But...
No buts - he needs you.
What lies you tell are up to you.
Though I'm told dentistry usually works.
Why me?
Because you could fuck, understand him, and meet the mother.
You got under his skin.
He loves you.
Truly.
Right, let's be havin' yer.
I brought your pad and some charcoal.
You look terrible, Thomas.
It's prison food.
Permanent trots.
You look like a bank manager.
How's...
Flora?
Yes, well, fine, fine.
Though motherhood seems to make her a little impatient.
She...
Baby boy arrived in November; Robert.
Just make sure that she doesn't...
...that she doesn't turn him into a banker, too.
I, um...
We'd uh...
We'd like to ask you to be his godfather.
Once you get out.
What on earth for?
Well, whatever you think of church or children, it's rather a good way to stay in touch with the people who matter.
Don't visit again.
- But, er...
- It's upsetting.
Oh.
Do something for me.
I was at school with Thomas, Mrs March.
I know who you are, Mr Berryman.
How is he?
He, er...
He's, um, he's grown a beard.
Hmm.
His father did that once, for Ibsen.
Does it suit him?
Yes.
Yes...
He looks like a submariner.
It's oddly like having him back in boarding school.
I was forbidden to visit there, too, in case I embarrassed him.
Oh, you needn't look at me with such sensitivity.
I'm well aware of what he did and why he's there.
I've been storing them in his absence... rather than leave them with that creature in Soho.
I write him letters in soft pencil on one side of cartridge paper so he can draw on the other.
Well, you should take this one.
It's only a study.
He must've sold the finished portrait.
I call it Man In An Orange Shirt.
But it's you, isn't it?
Yes.
So, you must take it.
No, no, I couldn't possibly.
I think it's wonderful, the colours.
But, our... our flat is so tiny.
Perhaps, um... perhaps just one of the notebooks.
Oh, well, that one's damaged.
Yes, but, er...
I was there, you see.
I have a very small house in France, Mr Berryman.
In a very small village in Cassis.
You can go there when Thomas comes out.
He can paint and you, you can... you can write something.
That's very kind of you, Mrs March, but, erm... he wants nothing more to do with me.
Oh, that's just pride.
And I have a wife and child.
Is she happy?
She's...
I should be getting home.
My darling Thomas, you refuse my visits so you're probably tearing up my letters, too.
But there's nothing else
I can do but keep trying.
It's beyond my control, do you see?
All those months ago when I had nothing to lose really,
I wrote to you in my head, but was too cowardly to set more than lies on paper.
And now I find I no longer care.
The love I feel for you runs through me like grain through wood.
I love you Thomas, I love you.
Your face, your voice, your touch enter my mind at the least opportune moments and I find I have no power to withstand them.
No desire to.
I want us to be together as we were in the cottage.
Only forever, not just a weekend.
I want it to go on so long that it feels normal.
I want to do all the ordinary unbedroomy things we never got around to doing.
Making toast, raking leaves, sitting in silence.
I love you, Thomas.
I've always loved you.
I see that now.
Tell me I'm not too late.
There she is.
Want to say hello.
- Oh, look.
So solemn.
So like his pa.
I can't believe he's nearly one already.
I say, not to worry about bridge tonight if Michael's away.
Patrick can always take me out somewhere instead.
Oh, tonight?
But he's...
I was coming out of South Ken on my way to Christie's this morning and I saw him striding towards the train with his suitcase as well as the usual briefcase.
Oh, yes.
I'm such a dolt, darling.
I completely forgot to tell you, he's got some dreary conference to go to.
Banking, weather, you know the sort of thing.
Well, we can play when he's back.
Are you all right?
Fine.
Oh, do hush, Robert.
Oh, hush!
For pity's sake!
Hello, can you put me through to
Michael Berryman, please?
Who's calling?
It's his wife.
Oh, of course, his wretched teeth.
How stupid of me to have forgotten.
Oh, stop it!
I can't bear it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Thomas..!
Thomas, boy!
How are you?
Thomas! Oh.
The key's in the cab, come on.
Hello.
Hello.
I'll tell you anything you'd...
I'd rather you didn't.
I don't want a divorce.
Please, Michael.
It wouldn't be fair to Robert.
But I don't want to make you wretched.
I never want details.
You must never get caught.
We will never speak of it.
Darling I...
Please, don't you love me at all?
Of course I do.
I'm just the sister who happened to bear your child.
I can live with that.
Lovely morning, sir.
Is all well?
He wants to make an entrance.
Ready?
We can't wait.
Stop laughing at me!
Oh dear.
Fortnum's will cheer him up.
I just need to find the gents.
We'll meet you down by the lifts.
Robert, can I help?
Sorry, sorry.
Who's joining me on a bus to Fortnum's?
Me!
May I come too?
Don't be silly.
Michael, Flora.
Thomas.
How are you?
Fine, fine.
Stunning day.
We've just been kitting someone out for boarding school.
So I'm bracing myself for a long afternoon sewing in name tapes.
He can't be that age already.
We haven't met Robert, I'm Thomas March.
I knew your father when he wasn't much older than you are.
Yes, yes, before I became respectable.
So Thomas, you've been too long a stranger we must have you over.
Yes, we must.
I've not longed moved, to Cassis.
To your mother's place?
Yes, that's right.
I'm just over for my new exhibition.
It opens tonight.
Oh, bother.
Well, you could go along, darling.
Well, no, it's Robert's last night of freedom.
I can't let you start school without a present, hmm?
Here.
Thomas, you shouldn't...
What do you say, Robert?
Thank you, sir.
Oh, that's our bus.
Come along, Robert.
Bye bye, Thomas.
Goodbye, old man.
I'll bag seats!
We're not going that far.
Oh, let him, this once.
School's not that much fun.
Two and a child to Piccadilly please.
Two and a child to Piccadilly.
There you go, sir.
Thank you.
Any more fares?
He'll drink himself to death in the sunshine.
Probably.
Is that where you were going?
Yes.
Look, they're really good ones.
Goodness.
Well, put them safely away until we get home or you'll get all mucky.
Don't fidget, Bob.
To Flora and Michael, in the hope that the enclosed might one day hang in your drawing room.
Thomas.
Who did you go with?
A friend.
He loved me, but he married me to be like everybody else.
This is so not okay.
You're leaving a table of friends just to fuck a complete stranger.
You're not even out, are you?
I bet you've still not told your granny.

# The.Boys.in.the.Band.2020.720p.NF.WEBRip.DDP5.1.Atmos.x264-NTG.srt
Come on.
Asshole!
Hey!
Sorry about that.
Enjoy your stay.
Coming!
Come on. Coming, coming, coming, coming.
Hello. Hello?
Shoot. God!
Hello! Oh, Jesus Christ!
Listen, what do you recommend for a catatonic fit in a parking garage?
I… Ugh, ask your doctor.
That's why I'm calling. He just canceled.
Can I come over?
Donald, you're about a day and a half early.
- What am I supposed to do?
- I just got in.
I'm not ready for you yet.
Why did the prick cancel?
I don't know.
He said he was just too sick.
Why don't you tell him you're sicker than he is?
He already knows that.
Okay, Donald, come on over, but bring a bag of ice.
Please do not give me any responsibility.
At this moment, I cannot cope with anything weightier than the directions to your apartment.
If you want a cold martini when you get here, you'll cope with some ice.
- I'll cope with some ice.
- And hurry up.
I gotta go.
I was saying hello to an old friend.
What?
10th and Broadway, please.
Coming! Jesus Christ.
- How did you get inside?
- The street door was open.
- You want a drink?
- Not until I've had my shower.
I want something to work out today.
I'm gonna try to relax and enjoy something.
You in a blue funk because of the doctor?
Christ, no.
I was depressed long before I got there.
This should pick you up.
I went shopping today, and I bought all sorts of goodies. Look.
- Sandalwood soap.
- I feel better already.
- Mm-hmm.
- What we got here?
Oh! Your very own toothbrush, because I am sick to death of you using mine.
- How do you think I feel?
- You've had worse things in your mouth.
{\an8}Oh, also for you, something called "Control."
{\an8}Notice nowhere is it called "hairspray."
{\an8}Just simply "Control" and the words "for men"
{\an8}written about 37 times all over the goddamn can.
Yeah, it's called Butch Assurance.
Well, it's still hairspray, no matter if they call it "balls."
It's all on your very own shelf, which is to be labeled
Donald's Saturday Night Douche Kit.
By the way, are you spending the night?
Nope, I'm driving back.
I still get very itchy when I'm in this town too long.
Why didn't the prick call you and cancel?
Suppose you'd driven all this way for nothing?
Why do you keep calling him a prick?
Who ever heard of an analyst having a session with a patient for two hours on a Saturday evening?
He simply prefers to take Mondays off.
He works late on Saturday taking Monday off?
What is he, a psychiatrist or a hairdresser?
Actually, he's both.
He shrinks my head and then combs me out.
Besides, I had to come in town for a birthday party anyway, right?
Oh, you had to remind me.
God, if there is one thing
I'm not ready for, it is five screaming queens singing "Happy Birthday."
- Who's coming?
- I think you know everybody anyway.
I mean, the same old tired fairies you've seen around since day one.
Actually, you know what?
There will be seven, counting Harold and you and me.
Are you calling me a screaming queen or a tired fairy?
Oh, I beg your pardon.
There will be six tired, screaming fairy queens and one anxious queer.
I'll be out of your way in a second.
I've only got one more thing to do.
Surgery? So early in the evening?
Sunt.
That's French with a cedilla.
I've got to comb my hair for the 37th time.
Hair, that's singular.
My hair, without exaggeration, is clearly falling on the floor.
You're totally paranoid.
You've got plenty of hair.
No, what you see before you is a masterpiece of deception.
My hairline starts about here.
All this is just tortured forward.
Look.
That's not good, huh?
It's not the greatest.
It's called getting old.
Oh, well.
One thing you can say for masturbation: you certainly don't have to look your best.
So what are you so depressed about?
I mean, other than the usual everything?
I really don't want to get into it.
Well, Donald, if you're not going to tell me, then how can we have a conversation in depth?
A warm, rewarding, meaningful friendship.
Up yours.
It's just that today I finally realized
I was raised to be a failure.
I was groomed for it.
Oh, Christ. How sick analysts must get of hearing how Mommy and Daddy made their darlin' into a fairy.
It's beyond just that now.
Today I finally began to see how some of the other pieces of the puzzle relate to them.
My neurotic compulsion to not succeed.
I realize it was always when I failed that Evelyn loved me the most.
Because it displeased Walt, who wanted perfection.
I began to fail on purpose to get love.
Failure is the only thing with which I feel at home because it's what I was taught at home.
No.
What is more boring than a queen doing a Judy Garland imitation?
A queen doing a Bette Davis imitation.
Where'd you get that sweater?
Oh, this clever little shop on the Right Bank called Hermès.
I work my ass off for 45 lousy dollars a week, scrubbing floors, and you waltz around throwing cashmere sweaters on them.
The one on the floor in the john is vicuña.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
You could get a job doing something else.
Nobody holds a gun to your head to be a charwoman.
That is, how you say, your neurosis.
Gee, and I thought it's why I was born.
Besides, just because
I wear expensive clothes, doesn't mean they're paid for.
That is, how you say, your neurosis.
However, thanks to the silver screen, your neurosis has got style.
It takes a certain flair to squander one's unemployment check at Joe Allen.
What's so snappy about being head over heels in debt?
The only thing smart about it is the ingenious ways
I dodge the bill collectors.
Yep, come to think of it, you're the type that gives faggots a bad name.
Oh, and you, Donald, you are a credit to the homosexual.
You're a reliable, hard-working, floor-scrubbing, bill-paying fag who don't owe nothing to nobody.
I am a model fairy.
You think it's just nifty how I've always flitted from Beverly Hills to Rome to Acapulco to Amsterdam, picking up a lot of one-night stands, a lot of custom-made duds along the trail?
I'm here to tell you the only place in all those miles, the only place that I've ever been happy was on the goddamn plane.
Run, charge.
Run, buy, borrow, make, spend.
Run, squander, beg.
Run, run, run. Waste, waste…
Waste.
And why?
Finis. Applause.
- Hey.
- Don't. You don't have to.
Hey, come on.
Oh, there's nothing quite as good as feeling sorry for yourself, is there?
Nothing.
Okay.
I adore cheap sentiment.
Backstage, Funny Girl.
- Hi, it's Alan.
- Alan?
Oh, my God.
Alan, oh, I don't believe it.
How are you? Where are you?
I'm here… on business.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Oh, I'm tied up tonight.
Alan, tonight's no good for me.
Oh, I'm tied up, too, but I thought
I might just drop by for a drink.
What, you mean now?
Well, Alan, old boy, listen to me.
It is a friend's birthday, and I am having a few people in.
- Oh.
- And I'm sorry
I can't ask you to join us. It's just…
It just wouldn't work out, kiddo, you know?
And I'd hate to just see you for ten minutes
- and then have to say goodbye.
- Mickey, please?
Alan?
- Mickey?
- Alan…
What's wrong?
I've gotta see you about something right away.
Okay, Alan, come on over.
No, it's perfectly all right.
Just come on over, have a quick drink,
- but-but hurry up.
- Same old address?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Well…
Am I stunning?
You're absolutely stunning.
You look like shit, but I'm absolutely stunned.
Your grapes are, how you say, sour.
Where's my drink?
I didn't make it. My old roommate from Georgetown just called.
- Alan what's-his-name?
- McCarthy.
He's up here from Washington on business or something, and he's on his way here.
I hope he knows the lyrics to "Happy Birthday."
Listen, asshole.
What am I going to do? He's straight.
What'll he feel about this freak show
I've got booked for dinner?
Ah, Christ, is that good.
He absolutely lost his spring on the phone.
He started crying, and that's not his style at all.
Alan's so goddamned pulled together, he wouldn't show any emotion if he were in a plane crash.
What am I going to do?
Are you suddenly ashamed of your friends?
Donald, you are the only person I know of whom I am truly ashamed.
Some people have different standards from yours and mine, you know?
And if we don't acknowledge them, then we're just as backward and narrow-minded as we think they are.
You know what you are, Michael?
You're a real person.
Thank you. Fuck you.
Do you want some cracked crab?
No, thanks.
How could you ever have been friends with a bore like that?
Well, believe it or not, there was a time in my life when I didn't go around announcing that I was a faggot.
That must have been before speech replaced sign language.
Don't give me any static on that score.
I didn't come out until I left college.
Seems to me that the first time we tricked, we met in a gay bar on Third Avenue during your junior year.
Cunt.
Thought you'd never say it.
Don't wait up.
Hi, doll face.
- You look cute.
- Always.
- Hello, Emory.
- Hi.
You know I hate coming between the two of you like this.
That makes one of us.
This is gonna be fun.
Oh, great.
Well, that's all we need, for it to rain.
- You want some more club soda?
- What?
There's nothing but club soda in that glass.
I've been watching you for several Saturdays.
You've actually stopped drinking, haven't you?
And smoking, too.
- How long's it been?
- Five weeks.
- That's amazing.
- I found God.
- It is amazing. For you?
- Or is God dead?
I could always tell when you were getting high. One way.
I'd get hostile.
Hey, what made you stop? The analyst?
Oh. He certainly had a lot to do with it.
Mainly I didn't think I could get through another morning-after ick attack.
Morning-after what?
Icks! Anxiety, guilt, unfathomable guilt.
From the second your eyes open and you say,
"Oh, my God! What'd I do last night?"
Mmm, tell me about it.
And then that struggle to survive till lunch…
- Mmm.
- …where you have a double Bloody Mary.
That is, if you've waited till lunch.
And then you're half pissed again and useless for the rest of the afternoon.
So you hang on till cocktail time, and by then, you're ready for whatever the night holds, which hopefully is another party, and that whole goddamn cycle starts all over again.
Well, I have been on that merry-go-round long enough, and I either had to get off or die of centrifugal force.
Oh, Joe College has finally arrived.
All right, Donald, listen to me.
Don't insult me by giving me any lecture on acceptable social behavior.
I promise to sit with my legs spread apart and keep my voice in a deep register.
Donald, you are a real card-carrying cunt.
All right. This is a raid.
Everybody's under arrest.
Hello, darling. Connie Casserole.
Oh, Mary, don't ask.
Hi, Emory. Come on, you can put it in the kitchen.
- Hi, Hank. Larry.
- Who is this exotic woman?
My dear, I thought you had perished!
Where have you been hiding your classically chiseled features?
I don't live in the city anymore.
I'll take those.
Emory, where's your present?
It's arriving later.
Larry.
Larry. Larry!
- What?
- Give Michael the gift.
Oh, here.
Louder, so my mother in Philadelphia can hear you.
- You were standing there in a trance.
- Was I?
- You both know Donald, don't you?
- Sure. Nice to see you.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you'd met.
Well, we haven't exactly met, but we've…
- Hi.
- Hi.
But you've what?
Seen each other before.
Oh, that sounds murky.
You've never met, but you've seen each other.
- What was wrong with the way I said it?
- They're gonna have their first fight.
The first one since we got out of the taxi.
- Where did you find this trash?
- Downstairs, leaning against a lamppost.
With an orchid behind my ear and big, wet lips painted over the lip line.
- Oh! Just like Maria Montez.
- Oh, please.
Hey, what have you got against Maria?
She was a good woman.
Hold on. Everybody, listen.
This old college friend of mine is in town, and he's stopping by for a fast drink on his way to dinner, but he's straight, so…
Straight? If he's the one I met, he's as straight as the yellow brick road.
No, you met Justin Stuart.
I don't remember meeting a Justin Stuart.
- Of course you don't, dope. I met him.
- This is someone else.
Yes, Alan McCarthy, a very close total stranger.
It is not that I care what he would think of me. Really.
It's just he's not ready for it, you know, and he never will be.
- You understand that, don't you, Hank?
- Sure.
Do you really think he doesn't know about you?
If there is the slightest suspicion, he's never let on.
What's he had, a lobotomy?
Hey, I was super careful when I was in college, and I still am whenever I see him.
- I don't know why, but I am.
- Tilt.
I was just like Alan when I was in college.
I was very large in the dating department.
I wore nothing but those constipated Ivy League clothes, and those, oh, ten-pound cordovan shoes.
- No offense.
- Quite all right.
I butched it up quite a bit, and I didn't think I was lying to myself.
I really thought I was straight.
I know damn well I did not come out until after I graduated.
What about all those weekends up from school?
Oh. I still wasn't out.
I was still in the
Christ-was-I-drunk-last-night syndrome.
"Christ, I was so drunk last night,
I don't remember a thing."
That's it.
You were just guilty because you were Catholic.
- That's all.
- That is not true.
The Christ-was-I-drunk-last-night syndrome knows no religion, although there's a high percentage of it among Mormons.
Who do you have to fuck to get a drink around here?
Will you light somewhere?
We all somehow managed to justify our actions in those days.
You know, I later found out even Justin Stuart, my closest friend...
Other than Alan McCarthy.
Zip it. He was doing the same thing.
Only Justin was going to Boston on weekends.
You see, in the
Christ-was-I-drunk-last-night syndrome, you really are drunk.
That part of it is true.
It's just you also do remember everything.
Well, a lot of guys have to get loaded to have sex.
So I've been told.
Donald…
…if you remember, the first time we made it,
I was so drunk I could hardly stand up.
You were so drunk, you could hardly get it up.
- Christ, I was so drunk, I don't remember.
- Oh, bullshit. You remember.
Oh, Jesus. All right, that's Alan.
Please, everyone do me a favor.
Cool it for the few minutes he's here.
Anything for a sis, Mary.
Emory, no!
I'm sorry, but that is exactly what I'm talking about.
- No camping.
- Sorry.
Think the Giants are gonna win the pennant this year?
Fuckin' A, Mac.
- Oh, hey, Bernard.
- Hey, baby.
I'll take these. Everyone's outside.
You can put your present with the others.
Oh, it's only another queen!
- And it ain't the red one either.
- It's the queen of spades!
Anybody ever tell you you'd look divine in a hammock, surrounded by louvers and ceiling fans and lots and lots of lush tropical ferns?
You're such a fag. You take the cake. Up!
- What about the cake? Whose job was that?
- Mine. I ordered it to be delivered.
How many candles did you say to put on it? 80?
Wait, Alan. There's too much noise.
I'll get another phone.
- Michael, did the cake come?
- No.
- Oh, God. Can I use your private line?
- Sure.
Listen, everybody, there is some cracked crab out there. Help yourselves.
Can I have the number for the
Marseilles Bakery in Manhattan, please?
- Is everybody ready for a drink?
- Yeah!
Ready? I'll be your topless cocktail waitress.
Please, spare us the sight of your sagging tits.
What are you having, kids?
- Is there any beer?
- Oh, in the fridge.
- I'll get it.
- Beer?
- Who drinks beer before dinner?
- Beer drinkers.
How can a sensitive artist like you live with an insensitive bull like that?
I can't.
Well, here's hoping.
Alan, don't be silly.
There's nothing to apologize for.
It's just that I feel like such a fool.
I can shoot myself for letting myself act that way.
Look, it is just as well.
I have people over.
It wouldn't be a good time to talk.
Hey, what about this?
What if we do lunch tomorrow?
Sure. Why don't you meet me at the Oak Room at about one o'clock?
That sounds perfect.
And listen, Michael, can you just forget about tonight?
Pretend it never happened?
Alan, done. It's forgotten.
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Great.
Yeah, baby! Let's hear that sound! Whoo!
A drumbeat and their eyes sparkle like Cartier.
Terrible.
Wow, thanks, Bernard.
It's like you stock up for the whole summer.
You kidding? That'll last him two days.
- Well, he's not coming.
- Oh!
Some people eat, some people drink, some take dope.
- I read.
- Yeah, and read, read, read.
It's a wonder your eyes don't turn back into your head
- at the sight of a dust jacket.
- At least he's a constructive escapist.
Oh, that's true.
What do I do? I take planes.
No. No, I don't do that anymore because I don't have the money to do that anymore.
I go to the baths. That's about it.
I'm about to do both.
I'm flying to the West Coast.
You still got that act with the donkey in Tijuana?
I'm going to San Francisco on a well-earned vacation.
I'm going to the Club Baths, and I'm not leaving till they announce the departure of TWA one week later.
You'll never learn to stay out of the baths, will you?
- Bernard, don't… Bernard!
- The last time Emily took the vapors, this big hairy number strolled in.
So Emory says, "I'm just resting."
Big hairy number said,
"Oh, I'm just arresting."
- It was the vice.
- Emory!
You have to tell everything, don't you? Thanks, honey.
You live with your parents?
Yeah, but it's all right, they're gay.
Thought that was funny, Hank?
What happened to Alan?
Oh, he suddenly got terrible icks about having broken down on the phone.
Kept apologizing over and over.
Did this big about-face, reverted to the old Alan right before my very eyes.
- Ears.
- Ears.
Well, the cracked crab obviously did not work out.
I don't know why everyone has such an aversion to it.
Sometimes you remind me of the Chinese water torture.
No. No, I take that back.
Sometimes you remind me of the relentless Chinese water torture.
- Bitch.
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Wonder where Harold is.
- Yeah, where is the frozen fruit?
Emory refers to Harold as the frozen fruit because of his former profession as an ice skater.
Whoo!
You know he's out here looking rough.
If your mother could see you now, she'd have a stroke.
Got a camera on you?
Oh, my God, it's Lily Law.
Everybody, three feet apart.
It's probably Harold now.
No, it's the delivery boy from the bakery.
- Oh, thank God.
- Ask him if he's got any hot cross buns!
Come on, Emory. Knock it off.
You can take her anywhere but out.
You remind me of an old maid school teacher.
You remind me of a chicken wing.
- I'm sure you meant that as a compliment.
- Good evening.
Hey, Bernard, remember that thing we used to do on Fire Island?
Whoo! That was in so far back,
I think I've forgotten.
I remember.
- Baby, come on, follow.
- What is it?
- It goes swing, swing. Hook, hook.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah!
Milk the cow, milk the cow, milk the cow…
You gotta swing it. You gotta hit it.
Look, it's the Geriatric Rockettes!
Here we go.
- Come on, Donald. Donald.
- No, God.
- God damn it, Hank!
- Why would you...
I thought… I'm…
You said that you weren't coming.
Well, I'm sorry.
Well, we were just acting silly.
When I called,
I was at a phone booth around the corner.
My dinner party isn't far from here.
Emory was showing us this silly dance.
I walked past, and your downstairs door was open.
This is Emory.
Everybody, this is Alan McCarthy.
Alan, counterclockwise, we have
Larry, Bernard, Donald, Emory and Hank.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
- Would you like a drink?
- Thanks, no. I-I can't stay long.
You're here now, so stay.
What would you like?
- Scotch, please.
- Scotch.
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.
Guess I'm the only beer drinker.
Whose, uh, birthday is it?
- Harold's.
- Harold?
- He's not here yet.
- She's never been on time in her li...
He's… never been on time in his life.
Hank, Alan is from Washington.
We went to college together, Georgetown.
- Ah.
- Yeah.
Well, isn't that fascinating?
If that's too strong,
I'll put some water in it for you.
It's fine, thanks. Fine.
- You in the government, Alan?
- No, I'm a lawyer.
- What do you do?
- I teach school.
Oh. Would have taken you for an athlete of some sort.
You look like you might play sports.
Well, I'm no professional, but I was on the basketball team in college.
- Played quite a bit of tennis.
- I play tennis, too.
- Great game. It is, yeah.
- Yeah, great.
- What do you teach?
- Math.
- Math?
- Yeah.
Math.
Kind of makes you want to rush out and buy a slide rule, doesn't it?
Emory, I need help in the kitchen.
- You're elected. Come on.
- I'm always elected.
- You're a natural-born domestic.
- Said the African queen!
You come, too. Fan me while I make the salad dressing.
This way, Emory.
Why don't we all sit down?
- Sure.
- Yeah.
I feel terrible barging in on you fellas this way.
Ah, that's okay.
- How've you been?
- Fine, thanks. And you?
You married?
- What?
- I see you're married.
Oh.
Yes, Hank is married.
Donald, cope with some ice.
- Do you have any kids?
- Yes, two.
A boy, nine. A girl, seven.
You should see my boy play tennis.
Really puts his dad to shame.
- I have two kids, too. Both girls.
- Great.
- How are the girls, Alan?
- Oh, just sensational.
- Yeah?
- They're something, those kids.
God, I'm-I'm nuts about them.
- How long you been married?
- Nine years.
Ah!
- Can you believe it, Mickey?
- No.
Mickey used to go with my wife when we were all in school.
Can you believe that?
Oh, Lord. Sorry.
You live in the city?
Yes, we do.
Oh!
I'm in the process of getting a divorce.
- Larry and I are roommates at the moment.
- Yes, they're roommates.
Oh, I'm very sorry. I mean...
- No, I understand.
- Mmm.
- I think I'd like another.
- Of course. I'm so sorry.
Can I help you, Alan?
Uh…
Can't seem to find the scotch.
It's in your hand.
Oh.
Of course. How stupid of me.
- Why don't you let me do that for you?
- Thank you.
- Where the hell could Harold be?
- Oh, he's always late.
You know how neurotic he can be about going out in public.
Takes him hours to get ready.
- Why is that?
- Why is what?
Why does it take Harold hours to get ready before he can go out?
Because she's a sick lady. That's why.
Alan, why don't we go upstairs and talk?
I'm just gonna finish this and go.
Come on. You can bring your drink.
- I-I finished it.
- Here.
- Excuse me. We'll be down in a minute.
- Oh, he'll still be here.
- Come on. This way, Alan.
- Sure.
What was that supposed to mean?
- What was what supposed to mean?
- You know.
- Do you want another beer?
- No.
You're jealous, aren't you?
I'm Larry.
You're jealous.
So, Donald, where have you been hanging out these days?
I haven't seen you in a long time.
Alan…
I want to try to explain something about this evening.
What's to explain? Sometimes you just…
Can't invite everybody to every party, and…
Some people take it personally, but not me.
I should apologize for inviting myself.
That is not exactly what I meant.
Your friends seem like awfully nice guys.
That Hank is a very attractive fellow.
Yes, he is.
- What's his roommate's name?
- Uh, Larry.
What does he do?
He's a commercial artist.
I liked Donald, too.
The only one
I didn't care for too much was…
What's his name? Emory?
Yes, Emory.
Just can't stand that kind of talk.
It grates on me.
What kind of talk, Alan?
Oh, you know, his… brand of humor, I guess.
He can be really quite funny sometimes.
I suppose, if you find that sort of thing amusing. He just…
Seems like such a goddamn little pansy.
I'm sorry I said that.
I didn't mean to say that. That's…
Such an awful thing to say about anyone.
But you know what I mean, Michael.
You have to admit he is effeminate.
- He is a bit.
- A bit?
He's like a butterfly in heat.
There's no wonder he was teaching you all to dance.
He probably wanted to dance with you.
Oh, come on, man. You know me.
You know how I feel.
Your private life is your own affair.
No, I don't know that about you, Alan.
I-I…
Don't care what people do as long as they don't do it in public or try to force their ways on the whole world.
What were you crying about on the telephone?
All I... All I can say is please forgive me for making…
Such an ass of myself.
You must have been upset or you wouldn't have said you were and that you wanted to see me, you had to see me.
- Michael, please.
- Is something wrong between you and Fran?
Listen, I've really gotta go.
Why are you in New York?
- Late for this dinner.
- Whose dinner? Where are you going?
- Is that the loo?
- Yes.
Excuse me.
What's going on in here?
Oh, Mary, don't ask.
Hank, why don't you come and join us?
That's an interesting suggestion.
Whose idea is that?
Mine.
He means in conversation.
- Where are the rest of the wine glasses?
- I's working as fast as I can.
- To your health.
- Up yours.
Up my health?
- Where's the gent?
- He's in the gent's room.
If you can all hang on for five more minutes, he's about to leave.
Well, at last.
Oh!
Who the hell are you?
She's Harold's present from me and she's early, and that's not even Harold, you idiot!
You said whoever answered the door.
But not until midnight.
He's supposed to be a midnight cowboy.
He looks right out of the chorus of a bus-and-truck Oklahoma!
Not until midnight, and you're supposed to sing to the right person.
I told you Harold has very tight, tight, black curly hair.
This number's practically bald.
Thank you, and fuck you!
Good thing I didn't open the door.
Not that tight and not that black.
I-I forgot.
Besides, I wanted to get to the bars by midnight.
Oh, he's a class act all the way around.
What do you mean, "get to the bars"?
Sweetie, I paid you for the whole night, remember?
I hurt my back doing my exercises, and I wanted to get to bed early.
Well, that's too bad. What happened?
I lost my grip doing my chin-ups, and I fell on my heels and twisted my back.
You shouldn't wear heels when you do chin-ups!
I shouldn't do chin-ups.
I got a weak grip.
Aw, weak grip. In my day, it used to be called a limp wrist.
Who can remember that far back?
- What's your card say?
- Here. Read it.
"Dear Harold, bang-bang. You're alive."
"Now roll over and play dead."
"Happy Birthday, Emory."
Sheer poetry, Emmy.
And in your usual good taste.
So conservative of you to resist a sign in Times Square.
- Cheese it, here comes the socialite nun.
- Shit. God damn it, Emory.
Well, I'm off.
Thanks, Michael, for the drink.
Oh, you're entirely welcome.
So I'll see you tomorrow?
No. No, I think I'm gonna be awfully busy.
Might even go back to Washington.
Got a heavy date in Lafayette Square?
- What?
- Emory.
Forget it.
Are you Harold?
No, he's not Harold. He's for Harold.
- Goodbye, Hank. It was nice to meet you.
- Same here, Alan.
If you're in Washington,
I'd like you to meet my wife.
That'd be fun. Wouldn't it, Hank?
Yeah, I'm sure they'd love to meet him…
Her.
I have such a problem with pronouns.
How many S's are in the word pronoun?
How'd you like to kiss my ass?
That's got two more S's in it.
- How'd you like to blow me?
- Mmm.
What's wrong with your wife?
She got lockjaw?
Faggot! Fairy!
- Emory!
- You goddamn freak.
Motherfucker!
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
Fucking faggot! Faggot!
- Get some ice!
- Freak!
What the hell is wrong with you, huh?
Just relax.
He just busted your lip, love. Larry?
Here.
- Jesus.
- Damn it.
Do you mind waiting over there with the gifts?
Well, Harold! Happy birthday.
You're just in time for the floor show, which you can see is on the floor.
Hey, you, this is Harold.
What's so fucking funny?
Life.
Life is a goddamned laugh riot.
You remember life?
- You're stoned.
- Happy birthday, Harold.
You're stoned, and you're late.
You were supposed to arrive at this location at approximately 8:30 dash 9:00.
What I am, Michael, is a 32-year-old, ugly, pock-marked, Jew fairy, and if it takes me a while to pull myself together, and if I smoke a little grass before I can get up the nerve to show this face to the world, then it's nobody's goddamn business but my own.
And how are you this evening?
Happy birthday, Hallie.
- What happened to you?
- Don't ask.
Your lips are turning blue.
You look like you've been rimming a snowman.
That piss-elegant kooze hit me.
Careful, Emory. That kind of talk just makes him so nervous.
Who is she?
Who was she?
Who does she hope to be?
Who knows? Who cares?
His name is Alan McCarthy.
Not the famous college chum?
Is this my surprise from you, Michael?
I think Alan is the one who got the surprise.
- You'll notice he's speechless.
- I hope she's in shock! She's a beast!
Is it his birthday, too?
- That's your surprise.
- Speaking of beasts.
From me to you, darling.
How do you like it?
Well, I suppose he has an interesting face and body, but it turns me right off 'cause he can't talk intelligently about art.
Yeah, ain't it a shame?
- I could never love anyone like that.
- Never. Who could?
I could and you could, that's who could.
Mary, she's gorgeous.
She may be dumb, but she's all yours.
I think my present is a super surprise.
I'm so thrilled to get it.
I would kiss you, but I don't want to get blood all over me.
Look at my top!
Wait till you see your face.
Come on, Emory. Let's clean you up, hmm?
Happy birthday, Harold.
- Thanks, love.
- Top is ruined.
Take one of mine from the bedroom.
The one on the floor is vicuña.
Just another birthday party with the folks.
Here's a cold bottle of Pouilly-Fuissé
I bought especially for you, kiddo.
Pussycat, all is forgiven. You can stay.
No. You can stay, but not all is forgiven. Cheers.
Who asked Mr. Right to celebrate my birthday?
There are no accidents.
And who asked him?
Guilty.
Always got to have your crutch, haven't you?
I'm not leaving.
I feel sick. I think I'm gonna throw up.
Say that again, and I won't have to take my appetite suppressants.
Easy does it. One step at a time.
I am not ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.
Nor will I be for the next two weeks.
Oh, my God! He's after me again!
- He's sick.
- Yeah, sick in the head.
Mary, take me home.
These queens are crazy.
Turning on.
- Anybody care to join me?
- Many thanks. No.
No, thank you.
How about you, Tex?
Yeah.
Michael, I left the casserole in the oven. Take it out anytime.
You're not going.
- I couldn't eat now anyway.
- Well, I'm absolutely starving.
I'll eat until I have a fat attack.
I said you're not going.
Beware the hostile fag.
When he's sober, he's dangerous.
When he drinks, he's lethal.
- Attention must not be paid.
- Well, I'm starved, Em.
I'm ready for some of your
Alice B. Toklas' opium-baked lasagne.
Are you really? Aw.
That makes me so pleased.
Maybe I'll serve it before I leave.
Nobody is going anywhere.
You're gonna have schmertz tomorrow you wouldn't believe.
Hey, do a figure-eight on that.
I'm turning on. You're just turning.
- Michael? Is there any air spray?
- Hairspray?
You're supposed to be holding his head, not doing his hair.
Air spray, not hairspray.
There's a can of floral spray on top of the john.
Thanks.
I keep my grass in the medicine cabinet in a Band-Aid box.
Somebody told me it's the safest place.
If the cops arrive, you can lock yourself in the bathroom and flush it down the john.
That's very cagey.
Makes more sense than where I was keeping it.
In an oregano jar in the spice rack.
I kept forgetting, and accidentally turning my hateful mother on with a salad, but I think she likes it.
No matter what meal she comes over for, even if it's breakfast, she says,
"Let's have a salad!"
You are definitely the type that still moves his lips when he reads, and who sits in a steam room and says things like,
"Hot enough for you?"
I never use the steam room when I go to the gym.
It's bad after a workout.
It flattens you down.
Just after you've broken your back to blow yourself up like a poisoned dog?
- Yeah.
- You're right, Harold.
Not only can he not talk intelligently about art, he can't even follow from one sentence to the next.
But he's beautiful.
He has unnatural natural beauty.
- Not that that means anything.
- It doesn't mean everything.
Keep telling yourself that as your hair drops out in handfuls.
Not that it's not natural for one's hair to recede as one reaches seniority.
You know, faggots are worse than women about their age.
They think their lives are over at 30.
Physical beauty is not that goddamned important.
Well, of course it's not. How could it be?
It's only in the eye of the beholder.
And it's only skin-deep.
Don't forget about that one.
Oh, no,
I haven't forgotten that one at all.
It's only skin-deep, and it's transitory, too.
It's terribly transitory.
I mean, how long does it last?
30 or 40 or 50 years at the most?
Yes, it's too bad about this poor boy's face.
It's tragic.
He's absolutely cursed.
And how could his beauty ever compare with my soul?
And although I have never seen my soul,
I understand from my mother's rabbi that it's a knockout.
I, however, cannot seem to locate it for a gander, and if I could,
I would sell it in a flash for some skin-deep, transitory, meaningless beauty.
Forgive him, Father, for he know not what he do.
Oh, Michael, you kill me.
You don't know which side of the fence you're on.
If somebody says something pro-religion, you're against them.
If somebody denies God, you're against them.
One might say you have a problem in this area.
You can't live with it, you can't live without it.
- Hot stuff coming through!
- Hey!
You know what? One could murder you with very little effort.
You hang on to that great insurance policy called the church.
That's right, I believe in God.
And if it turns out that there really isn't one? Okay, nothing lost.
But if it turns out that there is,
I'm covered.
Harriet Hypocrite, that's who you are.
Right. I am one of those truly rotten Catholics who gets drunk, sins all night, and goes to Mass the next morning.
It depends on what you think sin is.
Would you shut your minty mouth and get back to the goddamn kitchen?
Say whatever you want. Just don't hit me.
Well, is it bigger than a breadstick?
He's laying down for a little bit.
- How does the bathroom smell?
- Better.
Before it smelled like somebody puked.
Now it smells like somebody puked in a gardenia patch.
Dinner is served!
What would you like, big boy?
Alan McCarthy, and don't hold the mayo.
Oh, Em, it looks absolutely fabulous.
I'd make somebody a good wife.
- What is it?
- Lasagna.
Looks like spaghetti and meatballs sort of flattened out.
Well, it's been in the steam room.
- It has?
- Oh, my God.
"It looks like spaghetti and meatballs sort of flattened out."
Oh, yes, Harold, truly enviable.
As opposed to you, who knows so much about haute cuisine.
Raconteur, gourmet, troll.
- It's good.
- You like it? Eat it.
Stuff your mouth so you can't say anything.
Turning.
- Wine?
- No, thank you.
Oh, go on, kiddo. Force yourself.
Have a little vin ordinaire to wash down all that depressed pasta.
Sommelier, connoisseur, pig.
Aren't you gonna have any?
No, my lip hurts too much to eat.
Anybody gonna bring a plate up to Alan?
Oh. The punching bag is now dissolved into Flo Nightingale.
Do you like it, Hallie?
Mmm. I'm having seconds and thirds and maybe even fifths.
I'm absolutely desperate to keep the weight up.
You're absolutely paranoid about absolutely everything.
Oh, yeah? Well, why don't you not tell me about it?
You starve yourself all day so that you can gorge yourself at one meal, and then you moan and groan about how fat you are and how ugly you are, when the truth is you're no fatter or thinner than you ever were.
- Polly Paranoia.
- This is great, Emory.
Connie Casserole. No trouble at all.
Oh, Mary, don't ask.
Oh! Oh! And this pathological lateness, that's downright crazy.
Turning!
Standing before a bathroom mirror for hours and hours before you can walk out on the street, and looking no different after Christ knows how many applications of Christ knows how many ointments and salves and creams and masks.
I've got bad skin. What can I tell you?
Who wouldn't after they deliberately take a pair of tweezers and deliberately mutilate their pores?
There's no wonder you got holes in your face after the hack job you have done on yourself year in and year out.
King of the pig people.
Yes, you've got scars on your face, but they're not that bad.
And if you'd leave yourself alone, you wouldn't have any more than you've already awarded yourself.
You'd really like me to compliment you now, wouldn't you, for how honest you're being?
For being my best friend who will tell me what even my best friends won't tell me, you hateful sow.
And the pills!
Harold has been gathering, saving, and storing up barbiturates for the past year like a goddamn squirrel.
Hundreds of Nembutals, hundreds of Seconals.
All in preparation for, and anticipation of, the long winter of his death.
I'll tell you right now, Hallie, when the time comes, you'll never have the guts.
It's not always like it happens in plays.
Not all faggots bump themselves off at the end of the story.
What you say may be true.
Time will undoubtedly tell.
But in the meantime, you've left out one detail.
The cosmetics and astringents are paid for, the bathroom is paid for, the tweezers are paid for, and the pills… are paid for.
You're so sweet.
Blow out the candles, Mary, and make a wish!
Blow out your candles, Laura.
- She's 32 years young!
- Oh, my God.
- Now you have to open your gifts.
- Start with this one.
Presents! Where's the card?
- Uh…
- Here.
- Oh, from Larry.
- Larry.
Why would you put it on the back?
Oh, it's heaven.
Oh, I just love it, Larry.
- What is it?
- The deed to Boardwalk.
Aw. Gay pop art.
Oh, Larry, it's super.
It goes up the minute I get home.
- Oh, good.
- I don't get it.
You cruise Atlantic City or something?
How much did you pay for him?
- He was a steal.
- I'm not a steal. I cost $20.
And what do you do for $20?
I do my best.
Oh, what a nifty sweater.
Thank you, Hank.
You can take it back, exchange it for something else.
No, I think this one is just… nifty.
- Who wants cake?
- Everybody?
None for me.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
Oh, Bernard! How divine!
Look, everybody, bejeweled knee pads.
Monogrammed.
Bernard, you're a camp!
Thank you, Michael.
What?
Oh.
- You're welcome.
- What is it, Harold?
It's a photograph of him in a silver frame, and there's an inscription engraved and the date.
What's it say?
Just something personal.
Hey, Bernard, what do you say we have a little music to liven things up?
- Okay.
- Yeah, I feel like dancing.
Come on, Michael.
Oh, no, thanks. I can only lead.
- I can follow.
- Oh, I think I'll sip this one out.
Ha!
Come on, Tex.
Shit.
- Michael!
- Everybody, help clean up.
Go, go, go! Come on!
Come here, kid.
- Everybody, hurry up!
- Close the door!
- Come on, guys.
- Come on.
Get the fuck inside.
Oh God.
I'm dripping all over.
Take a towel.
Don't get the goddamn furniture wet.
- Here. Towel. Dry off.
- Jesus, Michael.
Thanks. Thanks, Michael.
Wanna dance?
Uh-oh, Yvonne the Terrible is back.
Oh, hello, Alan. You feel better?
Oh, no. No, no, no. Alan, no.
As they say in the Deep South, don't rush off in this inclement weather.
You'll never get a cab.
Revolution complete.
You missed the cake and you missed the opening of the gifts, but you're still in luck.
You're just in time for a party game.
Hey, everybody, game time.
Michael, why don't you just let him go?
He can go if he wants to, but not before we play a little game.
What's it gonna be, movie-star gin?
No. No, that's too faggy for Alan to play.
He wouldn't be any good at it.
What would you like to play, Michael?
The Truth Game?
Cute, Hallie.
Or would you like to play Murder?
- You all remember that one, don't you?
- Very, very cute.
As I recall, they're quite similar.
The rules are the same in both: you kill somebody.
- Mickey, I'm leaving.
- Stay where you are.
- Michael, let him go.
- He really doesn't want to.
If he did, he'd have left a long time ago, or he wouldn't have come in the first place.
- Mickey. I don't feel...
- My name is Michael.
I'm called Michael.
You must never call anyone called Michael "Mickey."
Those of us who are named Michael get very nervous about it.
If you don't believe it, try it.
I'm sorry. I…
I can't think.
You can think.
What you can't do is leave.
It's like watching an accident on a highway.
You can't look at it, and you can't look away.
Who's going to play with Alan and me? Everyone?
- I have no intention of playing.
- Yeah, nor do I.
Well, not everyone is a participant in life.
There are always those who stand on the sidelines and watch.
- What's the game?
- Simply this:
We all have to call on the telephone the one person we truly believe we have loved.
- I'm not playing.
- Oh, yes, you are.
- You'd like for me to play.
- I'd like to know who you'd call after all the fancy speeches
I've heard lately.
Who'd you call, Hank? Would you call me?
Oh! Sounds like there's, how you say, trouble in paradise.
Well, if there isn't,
I'm sure you could stir up some.
And who would you call? Hmm?
Don't think I think for one minute that it would be me.
Or that one call would do it.
You'd have to make several.
Three long-distance,
God only knows how many locals.
- I'm glad I don't have to pay the bill.
- Quiet.
Don't worry.
Michael won't pay it either.
Now, here's how it works.
If you make the call, you get one point.
If the person you are calling answers, you get two more points.
Somebody else answers, you only get one.
And if there's no answer at all…
You're screwed.
You're screwed if you make the call.
When you get the person whom you are calling on the line, if you tell them who you are, you get two points. And then…
If you tell them that you love them, you get a bonus of five more points.
Hateful.
Therefore, you can get as many as ten points and as few as one.
You can get as few as none if you know how to work it.
Hank, leave with me?
Oh, well, now, did you hear that?
You don't understand, Alan. I can't.
You can, but I can't.
If he doesn't understand, explain it to him.
- I'll explain it.
- I had a feeling you might.
Alan, Hank and Larry are lovers.
They're not roommates.
- Bedmates, lovers.
- Michael.
No man's still got a roommate when he's over 40 years old.
If they're not lovers, they're sisters.
- Hank is the one who's over 40.
- Well, you're pushing it.
Hank.
Yes, Alan. Larry and I are lovers.
But…
But you're married.
Jesus Christ.
I think you said the wrong thing.
Don't you love that quaint little idea?
If a man's married, he's automatically heterosexual.
Alan, Hank swings both ways… with a definite preference.
Now… who makes the first call?
- Emory?
- You go, Bernard.
- Mm. I don't want to.
- Go on, call up Peter Dahlbeck.
- That's who you'd like to call, isn't it?
- Who is Peter Dahlbeck?
The boy in Detroit whose family Bernard's mother has been a laundress for since he was a little black-eyed pea.
I worked for them, too, after school and every summer.
I think I've loved him all my life.
But he never knew I was alive.
Besides, he's straight.
Nothing ever happened between you?
They finally made it in the pool house one night after a drunken swimming party.
With the right wine and the right music, there are damn few that aren't curious.
And afterwards, we went swimming, in the nude, in the dark, only the moon reflecting the water.
How romantic.
And the next morning, you took him his coffee and Alka-Seltzer on a tray.
I remember I was worried sick all morning about having to face him, but he pretended like nothing at all had happened.
Christ, he must have been so drunk, he didn't remember a thing.
Odd how that works.
And now for ten points, get that liar on the phone.
- Mmm!
- Oh!
You know the number?
Sure, he's back in Grosse Pointe, living at home.
Just got separated from his third wife.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.
- DA or BY?
- What?
It's operator lingo.
It means "doesn't answer" or "busy."
He didn't even give it time to find out.
Come on, Bernard. Pick up that phone.
You know you want to call him.
You know that, don't you?
Well, go ahead.
Your curiosity's got the best of you now.
So go on, call him.
Do it.
- Hello?
- One point.
Who's speaking?
Oh!
- Mrs. Dahlbeck.
- One point.
It's Bernard.
Francine's boy.
- Son, not boy.
- Shh.
Oh, just fine, thank you.
Mrs. Dahlbeck, is-is… Peter at home?
Oh.
Oh, I see.
Oh, shit.
Oh, no, no.
Oh, no, no. No, no.
It-It's nothing important. I, um…
I just wanted to tell him that…
Just to tell him that I…
I love him… and I've always loved him.
That I was very sorry to hear about him and his wife.
No points.
Mama wrote me.
Yes, it is. It-It-It really is. Well, uh…
Would you just tell him that I called and said that I…
That I, uh…
I was just very, very sorry to hear and hope they can get everything straightened out.
Good night. Uh-huh.
Goodbye.
Two points total.
- Terrible. Next.
- You all right, Bernard?
Why did I call?
Why did I do that?
- Where was he?
- Out on a date.
Come on.
Emory.
Punch in.
May I have a number, please?
In the Bronx.
For a Delbert Botts.
A Delbert Botts?
How many could there be?
Wish I hadn't called now.
No, the residence number, please.
Thank you.
I do wish Information would stop calling me "ma'am."
Hey, by all means, scribble all over my phone.
It comes off with a little spit.
Ooh, like a lot of things.
Who the hell is Delbert Botts?
The one person I've always loved.
That's who you said to call, isn't it?
Right, emery board.
Ugh, how could you love somebody with a name like that?
Yes, Emory, you couldn't possibly love anyone with a name like that.
That wouldn't look good on a place card. Right, Alan?
I admit his name is not so good, but he…
Absolutely beautiful.
I've loved him ever since the first day I laid eyes on him, which was when I was in the fifth grade and he was a senior.
Then he went away to college, and by the time he got out,
I was in high school.
And he had become… a dentist.
And you went and had every tooth in your head pulled out, right?
No.
I just had my teeth cleaned, that's all.
- Oh, I shouldn't have called.
- Will you shut up, Bernard?
And take your boring, sleep-making icks somewhere else. Go.
I remember I looked right in his eyes the whole time.
I kept wanting to bite his fingers.
Well, it's absolutely mind-boggling.
- Phyllis Phallic.
- It absolutely boggles the mind.
I told him I was having my teeth cleaned for the junior-senior prom for which I was in charge of decorations.
I told him it was a celestial theme, and I was cutting stars out of tin foil and making clouds out of chicken wire and angel's hair.
Oh, Mary, it takes a fairy to make something pretty.
I got angel's hair down my shirt once at Christmastime.
Gosh, did it itch.
It would be terrible if you got that stuff in your…
I'll be quiet.
He was engaged to this stupid-ass girl named Loraine, whose mother was truly a real see-you-next-Tuesday.
Uh-uh. Don't digress.
Well, anyway… I was a wreck.
I mean, a total mess.
I couldn't eat, sleep, stand up, sit down, nothing.
Finally, I called him on the phone and asked if I could see him alone.
Clearly, not the coolest of moves.
He said okay.
Told me to come by his house.
I was so nervous, my hands were shaking.
I couldn't even look at him.
I just… stared straight in space and blurted out why I'd come.
I told him I wanted him to be my friend.
I said that I had never had a friend I could talk to and tell everything to and-and trust.
I asked him if he would be my friend.
He said he would be glad to be my friend, and anytime I wanted to see him or call him, to just call him and he'd see me.
And he shook my trembling hand, and I left…
- On a cloud.
- One of the ones you made yourself.
And the next day,
I went out and bought him a gold-plated cigarette lighter and had his initials monogrammed on it.
I wrote a card that said,
"From your friend, Emory."
Seventeen years old and already big with the gifts.
And then the night of the prom,
I heard Loraine and another girl I knew giggling together.
Obviously, Del had told Loraine about my calling and about the gift.
Pretty soon, everybody at the dance had heard about it.
They were laughing and making jokes.
Everybody knew that I had a crush on Dr. Delbert Botts and that I had asked him to be my friend.
What they didn't know was that I loved him, and that I would go on loving him years after they had all forgotten my funny little secret.
Well, I for one need an insulin injection.
Oh.
- Call him.
- Don't, Emory.
Since when are you telling him what to do?
Don't. You'll be sorry.
Take my word for it.
What have I got to lose?
Your dignity.
That's what you've got to lose.
Oh, that's a knee-slapper. I love…
You're telling him about dignity when you allow him to degrade you constantly by Uncle Tom-ing you to death.
He can do it, Michael.
I can do it. But you can't do it.
Isn't that discrimination?
I don't like it from him, and I don't like it from me.
But I do it to myself, and I let him do it.
I let him do it because it's the only thing that, to him, makes him my equal.
We both got the short end of the stick, but I got a hell of a lot more than he did, and he knows it.
I let him Uncle Tom me just so he can tell himself he's not a complete loser.
How very considerate.
It's his defense, Michael.
You have your defense, but it's indescribable.
Y'all want to hear a little polite parlor jest from the liberal Deep South?
Do you know why niggers have such big lips?
Because they're always going…
Christ, Michael!
Give me that. Let go, Michael.
I can do without your goddamn spit on my telephone, you nellie coward!
I may be nellie, but I'm no coward!
Yo, Bernard…
Forgive me. I'm sorry.
I won't ever say those things to you again.
Huh.
- BY.
- It's busy?
Loraine is probably talking to her mother.
Oh, yes, Delbert married Loraine.
I'm sorry, you'll have to forfeit your turn. We can't wait.
Well, you're not wasting any time.
- Who are you calling?
- Charlie.
I refuse to forfeit my turn.
It is my turn, and I'm taking it.
That's the spirit, Emory.
You hit that iceberg! Don't miss it.
Hit it! God damn it!
I want a smash of a finale.
- God, I'm drunk.
- You're a falling-down-drunk-nellie-queen.
Now that's the pot calling the kettle beige.
I am not drunk.
You cannot tell that I am drunk.
- I'm drunk.
- So am I.
- I am a major drunk.
- Shut up and dial.
I'm a major drunk of this or any other season.
It's ringing. It's no longer BY.
- Hello?
- One point.
Who's speaking?
Who?
Dr. Delbert Botts?
Two points.
Del, is this really you?
Nobody.
Yeah, you don't know me.
You wouldn't remember me.
Um…
I'm just a friend.
A falling-down, drunken friend.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
- He hung up.
- Three points total. You're winning.
He said I must have the wrong party.
Well, he's right. We have the wrong party.
It's your party, Hallie.
Having a good time?
Simply fabulous.
How about you?
Are you having a good time, Emory?
Are you having as good a time as you thought you would?
- My turn now.
- No, it's my turn to call Charlie.
No… Let me.
Are you gonna call Charlie?
Don't, Hank.
I want to.
Larry.
Be my eager guest.
Is he gonna call Charlie for you?
Charlie is all the people
I cheat on Hank with.
With whom I cheat on Hank.
The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker.
Right! I love 'em all, but what Hank refuses to understand is I gotta have 'em all.
I'm not the marrying kind.
I never will be.
Who're you calling?
Did it ever occur to you that Hank might be doing the same thing behind your back that you do behind his?
I wish to Christ he would.
Would make life a hell of a lot easier.
Who are you calling?
Well, whoever it is, they're not sitting on top of the telephone.
- Hello?
- Must have been in the tub.
One point.
- I'd like to leave a message.
- Oh, not in. One point.
Would you say that Hank called?
Yes, it is.
- Oh, good evening. How are you?
- Who the hell is that?
Yes, that's right.
The message is for my roommate, Larry.
Just say that I called…
It's our answering service.
…and said I love you.
Hank, are you crazy?
You heard me correctly.
The message is for Larry.
It's from me, Hank, and it is just as I said.
I love you.
Yeah, thanks.
Seven points total.
Hank, you're ahead, baby!
You're way, way ahead of everybody.
Why, Hank? Why did you do that?
Because I do love him, and I don't care who knows it.
- Don't say that.
- Why not? It's the truth.
I left my wife and family for Larry.
- I'm not interested in hearing about it.
- Sure you are.
Go ahead, Hankola. Tell him all about it.
- I don't want to hear it! It's disgusting.
- Some men do it for another woman.
Well, I can understand that.
That's normal.
It doesn't always work out that way, Alan.
No matter how you might want it to, and God knows, nobody ever wanted it more than I did.
I really and truly felt
I was in love with my wife when I married her, but…
There was always that something else.
Always?
I don't know. I suppose so.
I've known what I was since I was four years old.
Oh, everybody's always known it about you, Emory.
I've always known it about myself, too.
I don't know when I first admitted it to myself that…
I always labeled it something else or denied it completely.
Oh. "Christ, was I drunk last night."
There came a time where I couldn't lie to myself anymore.
I thought about it but never did anything about it.
The first time was during my wife's last pregnancy.
We lived near New Haven in the country.
There was this teachers' meeting in New York.
My wife didn't feel up to the trip.
I came into town on my own and…
That day on the train,
I began to think about it.
And think about it.
And think about it.
I thought of nothing else the whole trip.
And then 15 minutes after I had arrived,
I'd picked up a guy in the men's room of Grand Central Station.
Jesus.
I'd never done anything like that before.
I was scared to death.
He turned out to be a nice fellow.
I've never seen him again.
You know, it's funny.
Can't even remember his name anymore.
Anyway, after that, it got easier.
Practice makes perfect.
Then, sometime later,
Larry and I met at a party my wife and I went in town for.
And your real troubles began.
That was two years ago.
Why am I always the goddamn villain in this piece?
If I'm not the happy home-wrecker,
I'm an impossible son of a bitch to live with.
Guilt turns to hostility.
- Isn't that right, Michael?
- Go stick your tweezers in your cheek.
I'm fed up to the teeth with everybody feeling so sorry for poor, put-upon Hank.
Aw, Larry, everybody knows you're Frieda Fickle.
Hey, I never made any promises.
I never intend to.
It's my right to lead my sex life without answering to anybody,
Hank included.
And if those terms aren't acceptable, then we can't go on living together.
Numerous relations is a part of the way I am.
You don't have to be gay to be a wanton.
By the way I am,
I don't mean gay. And Emory…
You are the most promiscuous person I know.
I am not promiscuous at all!
Not by choice, by design.
Why would anybody want to go to bed with a flaming little sissy like you?
- Michael!
- Who'd make a pass at you?
I'll tell you who. Nobody.
Except maybe some fugitive from the Braille Institute.
- Why do you let him talk to you that way?
- Physical beauty isn't everything.
Thank you, Quasimodo.
What do you think it's like living with a goddamn Gestapo, huh?
Can't even take a breath without getting the third degree.
- Larry, it's your turn to call.
- And I am so sick of this let's-be-faithful- and-never-look-at-another-person routine.
That doesn't work.
If you want to promise that, fine.
Then you promise it, and you stick to it.
But if you have to promise it, as far as I'm concerned, nothing finishes a relationship faster.
Give me Librium or give me meth.
Yeah, freedom, baby! Freedom!
You got to have it.
It doesn't work any other way.
And-And the ones who swear their undying fidelity to each other are lying.
Most of them, anyway. 90% of them.
They cheat on each other constantly and then lie through their teeth.
I'm sorry I can't be like that.
It drives Hank up the wall.
There is that 10%.
The only way it stands a chance is with some kind of understanding.
I've tried to go along with that.
- Come on!
- I agreed to an agreement.
- Your agreement!
- What agreement?
A ménage.
A lot of people think that's the answer, but that's not my style.
I certainly didn't want it!
- Then who suggested it?
- It was a compromise!
- Exactly!
- You agreed!
I didn't agree to anything.
You agreed to your own proposal and then informed me that I agreed!
I don't understand. What's a...
I will kick you!
The ménage, baby.
Two's company, three's a ménage.
Oh.
It works for some.
Well, I'm not one for group therapy.
I can't relate to anyone or anything like that.
I'm old-fashioned.
I like 'em all, but I like 'em one at a time.
Did you like Donald as a single side attraction?
Yes.
- Did you tell him?
- No.
It was perfectly obvious from the moment you walked in.
What was that song and dance about having seen each other but never having met?
Don't look at me like that, Hank.
You've been playing footsie with that penguin all night.
Oh! I suppose you want the three of us to have a go at it.
- At least that would be together.
- Well, that point eludes me.
What kind of an understanding do you want?
Respect!
Respect for each other's freedom without any need to lie or pretend.
Hank, in my way, I love you, but you have to understand although I want to live with you, sometimes there might be others.
If that happens,
I know I'll never mention it.
But if you ask me, I will tell you.
He gets points!
What?
He said it. He said "I love you" to Hank.
He gets the bonus.
- He didn't call him.
- He called him.
He just didn't use the telephone.
- Then he doesn't get any points.
- He gets five points.
He didn't use the telephone.
He doesn't get a goddamn thing!
It's for you, Hank!
Hello?
One point.
Hello, Hank.
Two points.
This is Larry.
Two more points.
For what it's worth, I love you.
Five-point bonus.
I'll…
I'll try.
I will, too.
- That's ten points total.
- Larry is the winner.
Well, that wasn't as much fun as I thought it would be.
Game isn't over yet.
It's your turn, Alan.
Pick up the phone, buster.
- Michael, don't.
- Stay out of this!
You don't have to, Alan. You don't.
Emory, I'm sorry for what I did before.
Forget it.
Forgive us our trespasses.
Christ.
You guys joined at the goddamn hip now?
Who are you going to call, Alan? Hmm?
Can't remember anyone?
I believe this will be the final round.
Michael, aren't you gonna call anyone?
How could he? He's never loved anyone.
My God, Michael, you're a charming host.
Michael doesn't have charm, Donald.
Michael has counter-charm.
- Wait, are you going somewhere?
- Yes, excuse me.
You're going to miss the end of the game.
With any luck,
I won't be down until it's all over.
What do you suppose is going on up there, hmm, Alan?
What do you imagine that Larry and Hank are doing up there, hmm?
Whatever they're doing, they aren't hurting anyone.
And they're minding their own business.
Yeah, and you mind yours, Harold.
I'm warning you.
Are you, now?
Are you warning me?
Me?
I'm Harold.
I'm the one person you don't warn, Michael, because you and I are a match.
And we tread very softly with each other because we both play each other's game too well.
I know this game you're playing.
I know it very well, and I play it very well.
You play it very well, too, but you know what?
I'm the only one who's better at it than you are.
I can beat you at it, so don't push me.
I'm warning you.
You're funny, Hallie.
You're a laugh riot. Isn't he funny, Alan?
Or as you might say, "Isn't he amusing?"
He's an amusing faggot, isn't he?
Or, as you might say, freak.
That's what you called Emory, wasn't it?
A freak, a pansy.
God, what an antiquated vocabulary you have.
I'm surprised you didn't say
"sodomite" or "pederast."
You better let me bring you up to date.
Have you ever heard the term "closet-queen"?
You know what that means?
Do you know what it means to be "in the closet"?
If you're insinuating that I'm a homosexual,
I can only say that you're mistaken.
Am I?
What about Justin Stuart?
What about Justin Stuart?
You were in love with him, that's what about him.
And that is who you are going to call.
Justin and I were very good friends.
That's all.
According to Justin, that friendship was quite passionate.
What do you mean?
I mean that you slept with him in college several times.
- That's not true.
- Several times.
One time, it's youth.
Twice is a phase, maybe.
Several times, you like it.
- It's not true.
- Yes, it is!
Because Justin Stuart is a homosexual!
He comes to New York on occasion, and he calls me.
I've taken him to parties.
Larry had him once, and he has told me all about you.
Then he told you a lie.
You were obsessed with Justin.
That is all you talked about morning, noon and night.
You started doing it about Hank upstairs tonight.
"What an attractive fella he is."
All that transparent crap.
- I said he was attractive. That's all.
- How many times do you have to say it?
How many times did you have to say it about Justin?
What a good tennis player he was, what a good dancer he was, what a good body he had, how bright he was, how amusing he was, how-how the girls were all mad for him, what close friends you were.
We were very close, very good friends.
That's all.
It was obvious.
And when you did it around Fran, it was downright embarrassing.
- Even she must have her doubts about you.
- Justin lied.
If he told you that, he lied.
He'd say anything about me now to get even.
He could never get over the fact that I dropped him.
You ended the friendship, Alan, because you couldn't face the truth about yourself.
You could go on sleeping with Justin as long as he lied to himself and you lied to yourself.
And you both dated girls and you labeled yourselves men and you called yourselves
"just fond friends," but Justin finally had to be honest, and you couldn't take it.
- You couldn't take it, and so…
- No.
…you destroyed the friendship and your friend along with it.
- No.
- Oh, yes.
Justin never understood what he had done wrong to make you drop him.
- He blamed himself.
- No.
He did, until he eventually found out who he was.
- And what he was.
- No!
But to this day, he still remembers the treatment.
- Scars he got from you.
- No.
You pick up this phone, and you call Justin.
No.
I want you to call him and apologize.
You tell him what you should have told him many years ago.
- He lied. Not a word of it is true!
- Call him!
All right, then I'll dial.
You're so helpful.
Give it to me.
Hello?
One point.
It's Alan.
Two points.
- Yes. Yes, it's me.
- Is that Justin?
You sound surprised.
I should hope to think so, after all this time.
Two more points.
I'm in New York.
Yes, I…
I won't explain now, I just…
Called to tell you…
That I love you. God damn it, I love you.
I love you.
You get the goddamn bonus.
Ten points total. Jackpot!
- I love you, and I beg you to forgive me.
- Give me that. Give me that!
Justin, did you hear what that son of a bitch said?
Fran.
No, of course I knew it was you.
How are you?
Yes.
Yes, he told me everything.
No, now, don't thank me.
Please. Please, don't thank me.
I'll put him back on.
My love to the kids.
Darling, I'll take the first plane I can get.
Yes, I'm sorry, too.
I love you very much.
Thank you, Michael.
Who won?
It was a tie.
Now, it is my turn.
And ready or not, Michael, here goes.
You are a sad… and pathetic man.
You're a homosexual, and you don't want to be.
But there is nothing you can do to change it.
Not all your prayers to your God, not all the analysis you can buy in all the years you have yet to live.
We may very well one day be able to know what it is to live a heterosexual life if you want it desperately enough, if you pursue it with the fervor with which you annihilate.
But you will always be homosexual as well.
Always, Michael.
Always.
Until the day you die.
Oh, friends…
Thank you for a nifty party and a super gift.
It's just what I needed.
Bernard, thank you.
And you'll get him home?
Don't worry about her.
I'll take care of everything.
Good to see you, Donald.
Good night, Harold.
- See you again sometime.
- Yeah.
How about a year from Shavuot?
Come on, Tex. Let's go to my place.
Are you good in bed?
Well… I try to show a little affection.
Keeps me from feeling like such a whore.
Uh, Michael, thanks for the laughs.
Call you tomorrow.
Come on, Bernard. Time to go home.
Mary, you're a heavy mother.
Why'd I call?
- Why?
- Hey, thank you, Michael.
- Good night, Donald.
- Good night, Emory.
I'm gonna take you for some coffee, and everything's gonna be all right.
Careful.
Donald?
- Donald, Donald. Donald?
- Michael?
- Oh, my God, what have I done?
- Christ, Michael.
- Oh, God.
- Michael, I'm not...
Oh, no. Oh, no.
- Hey, hey.
- God, Donald. Oh, my God, no!
- I'll get you some water. Here.
- God, what have I done?
- Hey, stop it. Stop it.
- Jesus, God.
I'm gonna give you a Valium.
- No! Not pills and alcohol. I'm gonna die!
- I'm not…
Come on, take this. You're scaring me.
Stop that crying. Take this pill.
Come here.
Come here, Michael.
- Come here, Michael! Come here!
- Get off of me!
Jesus Christ.
Hey.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
Who was it that always used to say,
"Show me a happy homosexual, and I'll show you a gay corpse"?
I don't know.
Who was it who always used to say that?
If we could just not hate ourselves so much.
That's it, you know?
If we could just…
Oh. If we could just learn not to hate ourselves…
Quite so very much.
Yes, I know.
I know.
Okay.
By the way,
I think your analyst is a quack.
- Earlier, you said he was a prick.
- That's right. He's a prick quack.
- Or a quack prick. Whichever you prefer.
- Okay.
Harold was right.
You'll never change.
You suppose there's any possibility of just flushing this place?
What time is it?
It's early.
Where are you going?
The bedroom's ocupado, and I don't want to go to sleep yet anyway.
I'm gonna try and walk off this booze.
If I went to sleep right now, when I woke up, they'd have to put me in a padded cell.
Not that that's where I don't belong.
There's a midnight mass over at St. Malachy's that all the show people go to. I th...
I think I'll walk over and catch it.
Well, pray for me.
Maybe they'll be gone when I get back.
Will I see you again next Saturday?
Unless you have other plans.
No.
- Michael.
- What?
Did he ever tell you why he was crying on the phone?
No.
It must have been that he'd left Fran.
Or maybe it was something else, and he changed his mind.
Maybe so.
I wonder why he left her.
As my father said to me when he died in my arms,
"I don't understand any of it."
"I never did."
Turn out the lights when you leave, will you?
What? Oh.

# The.End.of.the.Affair.1999.WEBRip.XviD.MP3-XVID.srt
[ Man narrating ]
And perhaps I wouldn't
 be writing it if some devil...
Hadn't made me stop him
 that night... in the rain.
You want to drown, Henry?
Oh. I wanted a bit of air.
How nice to see you, Bendrix.
How long has it been? A year?
June, 1944.
As long as that.
How's Sarah?
Oh, she's out and about
 somewhere.
She at the cinema?
No, she never goes.
Hmm. Good night, Henry.
You should go home
 before you catch your death.
Is something wrong?
Let me take you home, Henry.
[ Bendrix narrating ]
 or perhaps I wouldn't
 be writing this...
If I had known then who I hated.
Was it Henry?
Was it his wife, Sarah?
Or was it some other who was
 yet to be revealed to me?
Sarah?
Sarah?
See, she's out still.
Come upstairs.
Come in.
Let me get you a drink.
Whiskey, thank you.
Whiskey.
So what's troubling you, Henry?
Sarah.
She's out for a walk now,
Bendrix.
A walk.
Well, she always was
 a great Walker.
Jealousy's a terrible thing.
Well, you know
 you can trust me, Henry.
You know, I went so far
 as to get the name
 of a private detective.
You think she's...
Seeing someone?
[ Chuckles ]
 of course you think me a fool.
No, Henry.
I don't think you're a fool.
You mean you think
 it's possible?
 of course.
Sarah's human.
Can't sleep.
Keep... picking up
 this wretched card.
Burn it.
I wish I could.
Well, then go and see--
 what's his name? Savage?
And sit where all the other
 jealous husbands sit?
Do you think they have
 a waiting room, Bendrix?
Where we see
 each other's faces
 as we pass through?
Why not let me go, Henry?
You?
Yes.
I could pretend to be
 a jealous lover.
Jealous lovers
 are less ridiculous
 than jealous husbands.
They're supported by
 the weight of literature.
Tragic, never comic.
Think of Troilus.
I shan't lose my amour propre
 when I interview Mr. Savage.
This is ridiculous.
One can't spy on one's wife
 through a friend...
And have the friend
 pretend to be her lover.
What else
 are friends for?
 you're a good chap, Bendrix.
All I needed was to talk,
 clear my head.
The name was savage,
 and the address
 was 3 vigo passage.
Forget what I've told you.
Doesn't make sense.
I'll see a doctor.
[ Door opens,
 footsteps approaching ]
 that was the door.
Sarah's come in.
It's the maid.
She's been to the pictures.
No, it was Sarah's step.
[ Henry ]
Sarah, darling.
[ Sarah ] Henry.
You. Is that you?
Been out for a walk?
Yes.
It's a filthy night.
You're wet through, Sarah.
One day you'll catch
 your death of cold.
[ Kisses ]
 good night.

 was conventional, like their

How nice of you to come.
Sarah,
 this is our neighbor,
 the novelist chap.
- What on earth is a novelist
 doing here?
- research.
On what?
On your husband.
I'm trying to write
 a character who works for
 the ministry of pensions.
I need to find out his habits,
 what he drinks before bedtime.
Cocoa, and when.
11:00, isn't it, Sarah?
Unless we're entertaining.
Would you be so kind
 as to excuse your character?
The ministry needs him.
Unfortunately, it does.
So, tell me.
What?
His secrets.
Henry's a good man,
Mr. Bendrix.
Good men have no secrets.
I was afraid you'd say that.
You see, goodness has
 so little fictional value.
- What does have
 fictional value?
- a minister of home security.
Are you saying my husband
 is fictional?
 no, I'm saying he could be.
In the right hands.
Oh, dear. This is alarming.
Can we get away from
 the service for a moment?
You mean change the subject?
I meant fresh air,
 actually.
Of course.
So how long
 have you been married?
Is your character married?
Yes, he's been married
 happily for ten years.
Henry's a perfect model then.
We've been married ten years.
You know that happiness
 is even harder to write
 than goodness.
Henry prefers habit
 to happiness.
- I'll give them to you
 to sign tomorrow.
- We were discussing the house let me take that for you.
[ Henry ]
 it's a lovely house.
My wife found it.
Your wife is charming.
She's a great help to me.
Yes, I'm sure.
They've made a picture
 of one of your books,
 haven't they?
Yes, it's playing at the Rialto.
- I'll take you both.
- I'm far too
 busy for pictures, should I make a note of that?
 yes, make sure your character
 never gets home before 10:00.
Oh, come out, Henry.
For once?
 you know I can't, darling.
But you go.
[ Sarah ]
No, I-- take her, Bendrix.
With Sarah, one has to insist.
Henry--

Where he offered her
 onions with her meal.
She refused

[ Bendrix narrating ]
 and, of course,
 as she began to love me.
She learned to deceive Henry.
So why was I upset
 to find that
 two years later...
She was deceiving him again?
Mr. Bendrix, I assume
 we are discussing
Mrs. Bendrix?
Not exactly.
She's the wife
 of a friend of mine.
Perhaps you and the lady
 are intimate?
No. I've only
 seen her once since 1944.
I don't understand.
You said this was
 a watching case.
Can't one love or hate
 as long as that?
There's nothing discreditable
 about jealousy, Mr. Bendrix.
I always salute it
 as a Mark of true love.
Well, I've come
 on behalf of the husband.
He thinks she's deceiving him.
She has secrets.
Ah, secrets.
Yes.
 well, there may be
 nothing in it, of course.
In my experience, Mr. Bendrix,
 there almost invariably is.
Shall my man report to you
 or the husband?
 uh, to me.
He must know nothing about it.
Ah. A most
 interesting case.
Well, all my men
 use great discretion.
I will put one on it
 immediately, and he will do his damnedest
 to put your mind at rest.
Or should I say, the husband's?

Henry.

No, I didn't notice
 anything wrong.
I wanted to ask you,
 but I know you're very busy, whether you could
 look him up occasionally.
I think he's lonely.
With you?
You know he's never
 really noticed me.
Not for years.
Well, maybe you've
 given him reason.
What reason could I give?
What reason did you give me?
None.
Are you on a new book?
Of course.
It's not about us,
 is it? The one you
 threatened to write?

 to write. It's too
 hard work for revenge.
If you knew how little
 you had to revenge.

Thank you.
I'm sorry. But you
 have to realize...
I'm jealous
 of everything that moves.
I'm jealous of the rain.
How can you be jealous
 of the rain?
Where did you get it?
Spain. That was my war,
I'm afraid.
Finished me off for this one.
You were shot.
How romantic.
Not really.
They put a pin inside me.
[ Chuckles ]
I wondered about the limp.
Could I grow to love it?
And have you?
I have never, ever loved
 anyone as much as you.
Thank you.
[ Knocking on door ]
 yes?
A Mr. Parkis
 to see you, sir.
Show him in.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I'll be with you
 in a minute, Mr., um--
 the name's Parkis.
Mmm.
Mr. Savage's man.
Sit down, take a cigarette.
Oh, no, sir.
Not on duty, sir.
Unless, of course,
 for purposes of concealment.
But you're not on duty now.
Well, in a manner
 of speaking, yes, sir.
I've just been relieved
 for half an hour
 while I make my report.
So there's something to report?
It's not quite a blank sheet.
Have we met
 somewhere before, sir?
I don't think so.
Well, like I say, sir.
It's not quite a blank sheet.
But then it never is.
Me and my boy,
 we followed the, uh--
 your boy?
My son, sir.
Yeah, I'm...
Teaching him the business.
I mean, a boy can be
 useful in all sorts of ways.
On the day in question,
 the party in question went
 by tube to Piccadilly...
And proceeded
 to the park Lane hotel.
She seemed quite...
Agitated.
And there met a gentleman
 with whom she was
 obviously quite close, since they greeted each other
 with an affectionate lack
 of ceremony.
And at one point,
 although I cannot
 be certain of this, held hands along the bar.
They held hands?
Yes, sir.
The gentleman pushed
 the lady's glass
 towards her, and the hand
 sort of stayed there
 for some time, sir, which would certainly indicate
 a squeeze of that nature.
After a short conversation,
 they proceeded to
 a restaurant called, uh,
Palmers, which was difficult
 to gain access to, me bein'
 with the boy and all.
But I observed them
 through the window.
And after a while,
 the lady left, laborin', well,
 it seemed to me,
 under great emotion.
[ Bendrix ]
 great emotion.
You're sure of that?
Oh, without doubt, sir.
You see, I then followed
 her down charing cross road
 to maiden Lane, where she turned into a church
 for what I can only presume
 w-w-was a good cry.
She's not a Roman, is she, sir?
No.
[ chuckles ]
Thought not.
She didn't kneel, sir, but sat.
And from
 the angle of her face,
I could tell...
Forgive the personal touch.
Of course.
You see, I liked the lady,
 the party in question.
- As did I, but you were wrong
 about the hands, Mr. Parkis.
- The hands, sir?
We never so much
 as touched hands.
Oh, dear.
I have made a fool
 of myself.
Sarah has that effect.
Mr. Savage should have
 introduced us.
Oh, no, sir.
It was up to me.
Well, it's not serious.
If you look at it
 from the outside, it's quite funny.
But I'm on the inside, sir.
It's not Mr. Savage
I mind about so much.
It's my boy, sir.
And when I tell him
 that you're the husband--
 yeah, but you're wrong.
I'm acting on
 the husband's behalf.
So you've requested
 an investigation of yourself?
It's an interesting paradox.
But who's the wrong party
 then, sir, if you'll forgive-- pardon me, sir.
I am slow in such matters.
Both you and the husband
 have been supplanted
 in that lady's affections by-- another?
Try to think of it
 the way I do, Mr. Parkis.
Jealousy can only exist
 with desire.
You are on a hunt for desire.
Just regard yourself
 as its servant.
Of course, sir.
That's my job.
Thank you.
The vicarious lover, Parkis.
Good night, sir.
Good night.

 playing the devil's game.
[ Clock ticking ]

 my boy managed
 to gain access, sir.
Remarkably useful, he can be.
I call that exhibit "a."
[ Sarah's voice ]
They say a promise is forever, but I don't know
 if I can keep this one.
He killed me with jealousy.
You're killing me with love.
So, he's got the scent too,
Parkis.
What scent?
The scent of love.
Stalking it like a retriever.
Well, he's remarkably
 persistent, sir.
He observed
 the party in question, then in a state
 of partial undress,
 with an unidentified male.
Where?
In the bedroom, sir.
The male party
 then closed the door,
 and my boy made his exit.
The implication,
 and I think you would agree, is that... intimacy
 was, uh, imminent.
Indeed. Who is he?
Well, now, here, sir,
 is where our progress
 was definitely made.
As my boy left, he glanced
 at the appointment book
 in the front hallway.
Now, the party in question
 had a dental appointment
 at 3:30 the following day.
And, in fact,
 she visited at 3:30 a premises
 on 65 cedar road...
Where no dentist's sign
 was in evidence.
[ Doorbell ringing ]
A Mr. Smythe
 owns the premises, sir.
[ Chuckles ]
"Smythe." with a "Y"?
Yes, sir.
S-m-y-t-h-e.
And, uh, no--
[ clears throat ]
 though we had no, uh,
 evidence... of intimacy, the implication
 is clearly there.
How is it there?
Why, the fictitious
 dental appointment, sir.
Exhibit "B."
My boy took that.
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
And the party in question
 emerged two hours later.
Passage of time being
 amply sufficient for, um,
 intimacy to have taken place.
The courts generally demand
 at least an hour, sir.
Now, my boy would have
 provided us with photos
 of her reemergence, but for the, uh,
 unfortunate occurrence
 of him fallin' asleep.
Luckily, sir, the, uh,
 party in question...
Mistook him
 for an abandoned urchin,
 are you lost?
Woke him up and led him
 to the nearest tube station.
So the time of reemergence
 is definitely established,
 as was an acquaintance, which may have its uses
 in the future,
 for all we know, sir.
So, should I walk in
 and confront him
 like the injured husband?
I'm against it, sir.
It complicates things
 in the courts.
This will never reach court.
An amicable settlement then.
There's lack of interest.
One can hardly make a fuss
 about a man called Smythe.
I'd just like to see him,
 that's all.
Well,
 perhaps Lance can oblige
 us next time with a frontal.
My boy.
Called after Lancelot.
The round table.
He found the holy grail.
That was Galahad.
Lancelot was found in bed
 with Guinevere.
I hadn't heard.
I have to say, sir,
I would advise against it.
Oh, I'd just like to see
 what a man called Smythe
 looks like.
Will you lend me your boy?
Well, if you assure me
 there'll be
 nothing unpleasant.
Well, Sarah isn't there.
This scene will have
 a universal certificate.
Come with me, young Lancelot.
Now, go on, Lance.
No need to worry.
Now, you're feeling ill,
 remember?

Can you act that?

I can go all pale, sir.

Sit down.
Were you two lovers, Bendrix?
It's the only explanation.
The only excuse too.
Can't you see that
 what you've done...
Is monstrous?
You must think me a fool
 not to have guessed.
Why didn't she leave me?
Because you're a habit
 she's formed.
You're her security.
Why did she leave you?
I became a bore, like you.
But I wasn't born one.
You created me.
She wouldn't leave you
 so I bored her
 with my jealousy.
You can't be jealous of me.
Well, you won, in a way.
We had come to the end of love.
She'd only make love with me, but she could shop and cook
 and fall asleep with you.
She's still very fond of you.
One isn't satisfied
 with fondness.
I was.
Yes, and that made you
 her pimp.
The bore of a husband
 who knows where
 his slippers are...
But never notices his wife.
But you weren't

I get tired of trying to
 convince him that I love him..
And shall love him forever.
He pounces on my words
 like a barrister
 and twists them.
[ Bendrix ]
 so what will you do
 when it ends?
You think love ends
 when you don't see me?
To be is to be perceived.
Do I exist for you
 when you're with Henry?
Yes.
Isn't that why
 you stay with Henry?
Because you know this will end?
No.
[ loud explosion ]
We should go to the basement.
My landlady
 might be there.
Does that matter?
Maybe to her.
It's close, Maurice.
I'll go and check.
Let me go with you.
I'll be one second.
Hello?
There's nobody there.
It's clear.
Maurice!
Maurice!
[ Coughing ]
Maurice!
Oh, god!
Oh, god.
Oh, god.
Oh, god, don't take him.
[ Sarah's voice ]
 but you had.
Maurice.
Maurice.
Whatever was him was gone.
You'd taken it.
Maurice.
Maurice.
I've never believed
 in prayer.
God, please bring him back.
Let him live.
I don't believe
 in you, but please, let him live.
Dear god, please...
Let him--
Maurice.
Maurice!
Maurice!
[ Sobbing ]
 dear god, please let him live.
Please bring him back.
Please don't take him.
I'll give him up forever.
Only please, let him be alive.
Let him live, and I promise...
I'll never see him again.
Sarah?
Oh, my god.
You're alive?
[ Bendrix ]
 you sound disappointed.
[ Sarah's voice ]
 but if he was alive, now I was dead.
Sarah.
What were you doing
 on the floor?
Praying.
To what?
 to anything
 that might exist.
[ Sarah narrating ]
 how could I explain to him...
What made no sense to me?
You didn't move.
I knew for certain
 you were dead.
There wasn't much
 to pray for then, was there?
 a miracle.
And we don't believe in that.
[ Air raid siren wailing ]
And that siren means you go.
Yes.
[ Sarah's voice ]
 and I knew that nothing
 in this world...
Would make sense to me again.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Sarah.
Love doesn't end...
Just because we don't
 see each other.
Doesn't it?
 people go on
 loving god, don't they, all their lives...
Without seeing him?
That's not my kind of love.
Maybe there's no other kind.
[ Men chattering ]
[ Sarah narrating ]
I can't be held
 to that promise.
But something told me
I would be.
I had tempted fate, and fate had accepted.
So I was in the desert now, a desert without him.
I started a tour with Henry-- civil defense
 in Southern England--
Henry and I
 sleeping side by side
 like figures on tombs.
In the new reinforced shelter
 at Bigwell-on-Sea, the chief warden kissed me.
I allowed him to,
 but felt nothing.
I'm beginning
 to believe in you, god.
And maybe that's how you work.
You empty me of love,
 then fill that emptiness.
[ Henry ]
 they're recommending me
 for an O.B.E.
[ Sarah ]
 what's that?
Step below a C.B.E.
When I retire,
I'll probably be a K.B.E.
It's confusing.
Couldn't they stick
 to the same letters?
Would you like to be lady miles?
[ Man narrating newsreel ]
 this was the British people's
 finest day--
V.E. day--
 the end of the German war.
A man we seem to have seen
 before somewhere...
Looks down from a balcony
 in Whitehall.
[ Cheering ]
[ Sarah narrating ]
 the whole of London seemed
 happy because there was peace.
And there were no more bombs.
But I'm not sure
I like the peace.
I walked his walks, tried to think where he'd be.
Then I gave up.
I thought that now
 the world is at peace, maybe I should have some.
I told him it all.
And whoever heard my promise
 must have heard it too...
And must have known it already, since god knows everything.
How cruel that knowledge seemed.
It knew what I would say
 before I made that promise.
Knew it would keep me to it.
Knew me the way
 his hands knew me.
[ Henry ]
Sarah, darling.
Henry.
You.
 knew I would meet him
 on the stairs.
Been out for a walk?
Yes.
It's a filthy night.
You're wet through,
Sarah.
One day you'll catch
 your death of cold.
Good night.
Knew he would hate me.
Wednesday.
[ Bendrix ] Wednesday?
 let me check.
Uh, would Thursday do?
Thursday, then.
The park Lane hotel
 at 1:00?
I took my time.
I didn't want to be early.
Why did you want to meet?
[ Sarah narrating ]
I wanted to tell you I've been
 dead for the past two years.
I can't be without you
 any longer.
I think he's lonely.
But of course, I didn't.
He's never really noticed me.
Not for years.
Maybe you've given him reason.
What reason could I give?
What reason did you give me?
None.
Are you on a new book?
Of course.
It's not about us, is it?
 the one you threatened
 to write?
A book takes a year to write.
It's too hard
 work for revenge.
If you knew how little
 you have to revenge--
I'm joking.
We had a good time together.
I mean, we're adults...
And we knew it had
 to end sometime.
And now we can lunch
 and talk about Henry.
[ Sarah narrating ]
 in the old days,
 he would have followed.
We would've made up.
Or made love.
I said to god,
 as I might've
 said to my father,
"dear god, I'm tired.
"I'm tired of being without him.
And it's all because of you."
Dr. Gilbert's appointment.
I'd almost forgotten.
He asked me how I felt.
I said I felt nothing.
There was a stone
 where my heart should be.
I need help, father.
Sarah, god granted us free will.
Good. So it's settled.
I'm leaving my husband.
You can't.
Why can't I?
I'm a whore and a liar.
I'm asking Henry for a divorce.
You can't...
Because you're good.
Better than any person I know.
You're wrong, father.
And you don't know me.
[ Sarah narrating ]
I found a small boy
 sleeping on the steps...
With a birthmark
 covering his face...
And wondered what kind of god
 would give a child that.
Are you lost?
It's all right.
It's all right.
Where do you live, then?
You'll be
 all right, now?
 yes, ma'am.
I kissed his cheek and wished
I could wash it away.
And suddenly I felt happy again.
I could free myself of this.
I...
Am leaving you.
For the last...
Five years,
I have been...
In love...
With Maurice.
[ Henry ]
I love you.
Do you know that?
Why now, Henry?
Why do you say that now?
I had a drink with Bendrix.
A horrible drink.
[ Whispering ]
I can't do without you.
Oh, yes, you can, I thought.
You changed
 your newspaper once,
 and you soon got used to it.
What's wrong, Henry?
Did Bendrix upset you
 in some way?
I know I haven't been
 much of a husband
 to you, my dear.
We are good friends.
You can do without a friend.
Don't leave me, Sarah.
Stick it out a few more years.
I'll try.
I promise.
Is this coincidence, I wondered, or the way life happens?
And if this is life, am I stuck with it?
But whatever it is,
I can't fight it anymore.
It has won...
And we have lost.
[ Phone ringing ]
[ Ringing continues ]
Hello?
[ Bendrix ]
Sarah.
She's not here.
I know your voice, Sarah.
Talk to me.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah.
Sarah!
[ Sobbing ]
Stop here.
- Thank you.
- [ Man ]
Thank you very much, gov.
One, please.
Ticket, sir.
Sarah.
How did you get it?
[ Sighs ]
 you had a drinks
 party last week.
Yes.
That small man.
Yes.
He is my snoop.
Oh, Maurice.
How ridiculous.
It's no more
 ridiculous than you.
Why didn't you tell me?
I tried.
Each time I tried,
 something would happen.
That's mumbo-jumbo,
Sarah.
No, it doesn't work like that.
Accidents.
Little things.
God is in
 the details, Maurice.
You can't believe that.
Do you believe
 in things you can't see?
You mean him?
I mean you.
You see,
I never stopped loving you, even though I couldn't see you.
My mother baptized me
 a catholic.
My father was Jewish,
 so we never practiced.
But she always said
 she hoped it would "take."
Like a vaccination.
I've only made
 two promises in my life.
One was to marry Henry, the other to stop seeing you.
And I'm too weak to keep either.
I know you don't believe in him, but try to.
Talk to him.
I can't.
Tell him I'm sorry.
I'm too human, too weak.
Tell him
I can't keep my promises.
I'm tired of being without you.
Let's get you home.
[ Sobbing ]
I don't want to go home.
I know.
So have we broken the spell?
The world didn't end, did it?
It did, in a way.
But then it always did.
Can I sleep now, Maurice?
Please let me sleep.
[ Doorbell ringing ]
It's Henry.
Don't answer it.
Why not? We'll have
 to tell him sometime.
Come away with me.
Where?
Anywhere.
Brighton.
I want a few days' peace
 before the arguments begin.
Henry never argues.
I wasn't talking about Henry.
[ Man chattering ]
[ Bendrix narrating ]
 pain is easy to write.
In pain, we're all
 drably individual.
But what can one write
 about happiness?
[ Screaming ]
 whoo!
[ Both laughing, shouting ]
It doesn't suit you,
 and it's mine!
 you want it?
There's a price.
How much?
Can I pay again?
I want children,
 you know.
How many?
We'll start
 with one.
Only one?
You want to start with two?
Is that a promise?
Yes.
[ Coughing ]
Let's get you back to the hotel.
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
[ Chattering ]
Still on the job, Parkis?
 don't worry. Don't worry.
[ Gasps ] Oh, dear.
Come with me.
Come.
So where's your boy this time?
I left him
 at home, sir.
Hardly a wise move.
He'd have had the sense
 not to get noticed.
You think so, sir?
 perhaps I wasn't cut out
 for this job.
Tell your employer
 the circumstances are unique.
That-- what was your phrase?
 the party in question
 is a writer.
They notice everything.
They certainly
 seem to, sir.
So who's hired you this time?
I'm not at Liberty to say.
Let me guess:
The jealous husband.
I never expected to be
 recalled to this case, sir.
Yours is a secure
 profession, Parkis.
As long as fools
 like us love, your
 employment never ends.
You could put it like that.
And love never ends, does it?
It seems not, sir.
What do you need,
Parkis?
Photographs of us
 in flagrante delicto?
Copies of hotel bills?
 evidence of soiled sheets?
 we'd be happy to oblige.
No. My brief
 is to follow you.
Inform him
 as to your whereabouts.
Which, of course,
 you'll do.
I'm obliged to, sir, under the terms
 of my employment,
 posthaste.
But won't you need
 supplementary evidence?
 divorce courts will demand it.
They generally do, sir,
 if it come to that.
Well, exhibit "a."
Um, receipt for
 two sandwiches bought
 on the train to Brighton.
Mutual sandwiches are surely
 evidence of intimacy,
 aren't they?
They could be so construed, sir.
Exhibit "b" -- two tickets for a big Dipper.
[ Sighs ] you seem to be
 doing my job for me, sir.
But we haven't got there.
I mean, what would
 clinch it for us, Parkis?
What would make
 divorce a certainty?
Generally, sir, some kind of
 photographic evidence of, um-- of intimacy.
W-would be
 most useful, sir, if it came to such a pass.
It will, Parkis.
It most certainly will.
Sarah.
[ Coughing ]
I dreamt
 we had a child.
We will.
We were on the bed together.
The room filled up with water.
There was a child between us.
Why water?
The sea had come in the window.
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
So, you'll marry me.
That's a promise.
The prince regent began
 building it for his mistress,
Mrs. Fitzherbert.
Beautiful but flawed.
How was she flawed?
She was catholic.
Impossible, of course.
So he loved her?
Yes, but he married
Princess Caroline
 of Brunswick, who was protestant.
But huge. And he built
 this huge folly
 to impossibility.
Not now, Henry.
Forgive me, Sarah.
I had to.
- Oh, god.
Please, Henry. Not now.
- You had to what, Henry?
Talk.
Go back home, Henry.
You can't hold on
 to her forever.
I know, but-- it hardly suits you,
Henry-- the role of a jealous husband.
Please, Bendrix.
I don't mean
 to make a scene.
Go home.
I'm not jealous, Bendrix.
What was it you said?
Lovers are jealous.
Husbands are ridiculous.
I was never her lover.
Not much
 of a husband either,
I'm afraid.
But you hired our detective.
I had to find out where she was.
So you know.
She wants a divorce.
That won't be possible, old man.
You'll contest it?
No.
But it would take
 at least three months.
What's three months, Henry, out of a lifetime?
Half.
Half of what?
Of a lifetime, I'm afraid.
Sarah's dying, Bendrix.
Her doctor called the night
 she didn't come back...
With the result of some tests.
I knocked on your door.
I imagined you were both there.
H-how oddly we behave
 at such moments.
You shouldn't get wet, darling.
Don't you like the rain, Henry?
Yes, dear, but-- you've had news, Henry.
Is it good?
No, dear.
You see, Maurice?
Never make a promise.
You may have to keep it.
You should never have been
 jealous of me, Bendrix.
I did Sarah
 a great disservice
 when I married her.
I realize that now.
I'm not the sort
 that makes a lover.
She wanted someone like you.
I'm not sure
 it's as simple as that.
If you don't mind me asking,
I'd like you there
 when the time comes.
It may not come, Henry.
You of all
 people don't believe
 in miracles, Bendrix.
No, but Sarah does.
See, I always believed
 that I'd be the one
 to die first, and that Sarah would
 know what to do.
Are you at a loss, Henry?
I am, quite.
And it would save you a bit...
If you moved in with us.
Sarah always said your books
 weren't as successful
 as they should have been.
You could be there, working in the daytime
 while I'm at the ministry.
And at night, we could both--
[ Bendrix narrating ]
 and so I moved to the north
 side of the common.
[ Doorbell rings ]
 and oddly enough,
I felt instantly at home.
[ Ring ]
Oh.
Can I help you, father?
I've come about Mrs. Miles.
She's indisposed.
You mean she's ill, don't you?
Yes, I suppose I do.
Yes.
She's been to see me
 several times.
And I know she would
 like to see me before-- she left word with me
 she is not to be disturbed.
Is her husband here?
No.
She told me about you.
I know she did.
I'm the lover, father.
Who was that?
The postman.
What did he bring?
He had the wrong address.
How odd for a postman.
You know what happened that day?
You thought I was dead, and I wasn't.
No, darling.
Something happened in that room.
There were the same
 walls around me, the same sunlight
 coming in the window.
But nothing would ever be
 the same again.
You can't believe this, Sarah.
[ Whispering ]
 but it's true.
I never loved anyone
 as I loved you.
Then when you came
 through that door
 with blood on your face, another kind of love
 came with you.
And I caught belief...
Like a disease.
[ Whispering ]
I fell into belief
 like I'd...
Fallen into love.
And I tried to fight it, but I haven't any fight left.
It wasn't the postman, was it?
No, it wasn't.
Dear Maurice,
 you can't go on fighting.
It's only love, after all.
[ Bendrix narrating ]
 so, you're taking her.
But you haven't got me yet.
I don't want your peace
 and your love.
I wanted Sarah for a lifetime.
And you're taking her from me.
So I hate you, god.
I hate you
 as though you existed.
[ Henry ]
Bendrix!
You have to help me,
Bendrix. I can't.
I will.
I can't live in a world
 where she's gone.
I'll help you.
I would have taken care
 of all the arrangements
 if I'd known.
Surely you disapprove
 of cremation.
I would've arranged
 a catholic burial.
But she wasn't a catholic, was she, Henry?
We recognize
 the baptism of desire.
She said things
 that seemed like prayers.
We've made all
 the arrangements.
We can't alter things now, you wouldn't want talk, Henry.
There's
 the notice in the times.
No, no.
If you'd come
 a little sooner, father.
Please don't think--
I think nothing bad
 of you, Mr. Miles.
Perhaps me.
Don't worry,
Mr. Bendrix.
Nothing you can do
 will affect her now.
She was a good woman.
She was nothing
 of the sort. Bendrix!
She could put the blinkers
 on any man. She deceived you,
 father, her husband and me.
She was a consummate liar.
[ Henry ]
You've no right.
[ Father ]
 let the poor man rave.
Don't give me professional pity!
- Keep it for
 your confessional.
- You can find me there
I don't want you, father.
I'm no Sarah.
[ Henry ] Sorry, father.
No need to be. You see,
I know when a man is in pain.
I'm not in pain, father.
I'm in hate.
I hate Sarah
 because she was a tart
 to your mumbo-jumbo.
I hate Henry
 because she stuck to him.
And I hate you and your
 imaginary god because you took
 her away from all of us.
[ Scoffs ]
 you are a good hater.
To hell with all of you!
I'm sorry, Henry.
The thing is, Bendrix,
I always knew.
I knew she was with someone.
But I never thought you.
The odd thing is,
I'm glad it was.
It's a sad pleasure
 to see you here, sir, where bygones
 are always bygones.
Do you always follow
 your people as far as this?
She was a very fine lady, sir.
At the cocktail party,
 she handed me
 a glass of Sherry.
Was it south African Sherry?
I wouldn't know, sir.
There weren't many like her.
My boy, now,
 he's always speaking of her.
How is your boy, Parkis?
He's exceptionally well, sir,
 but he's a bit upset today.
He imagined she'd be buried
 in a catholic way.
And why would he think that?
Young boys, sir,
 they get these ideas.
Though I have to admit,
 even I can't explain it.
Explain what?
On the day of her assignation, she walked him to a tube.
She thought he was lost,
 gave him a coin, and
 kissed him on his cheek.
On his affected cheek, sir.
And over the weeks
 that followed, his affliction
 gradually went away.
I tried to keep him
 rational, but he swears
 it was because of her.
Say hello
 to Mr. Bendrix, Lance.
Hello, sir.
[ Bendrix narrating ]
I wrote at the start
 that this was a diary of hate.
I hated you
 as though you existed.
Now I'm tired of hating, but you're still here.
So your cunning is infinite.
You used my hate to win
 my acknowledgement.
Thank you, Henry.
And I've only one prayer left.
Dear god, forget about me.
Look after her and Henry.

# The_Power_of_the_Dog_2021.srt
When my father passed,
I wanted nothing more than my mother's happiness.
For what kind of man would I be if I did not help my mother?
If I did not save her?
You're not eating?
No.
Have you figured it out yet, fatso?
What?
How many years since we took over the ranch
from the Old Gent and Old Lady?
Why?
Oh hell, think about it.
You ever try the house bath, Phil?
No, I have not.
Early up tomorrow, brother.
Big old drive.
There's a dead cow.
Keep our cattle away.
- What happened?
- Anthrax. Don't touch.
Well, guess this is it.
What's "it," Phil?
What's "it"? All right, fatso,
I'll tell you what "it" is.
Twenty-five years since our first run together.
Nineteen hundred and nothing.
That's a long time.
Well, not too damn long.
Know what we should do?
What's that?
Go camping again in the mountains and shoot ourselves some fresh elk liver.
Cook it right there on the coals like Bronco Henry taught us.
You got a sore gut?
No.
You act like it pains you to hitch two words together.
There'll be 12 for tonight.
Do you what they'd prefer to eat?
They like the fried chicken dinner.
Yes?
I'm going to need your room.
All right.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Is that an album?
Not really.
- May I?
- Sure.
- Do you like the mansion?
- Too much to clean.
You wouldn't have to clean it.
There would be cleaners.
Oh, she's beautiful.
I like her flowers.
Oh! That's clever, Peter.
They're so lovely.
Thanks.
For the tables?
Sure.
- I need three chickens. Can you do them?
- All right.
You're gonna have to move your stuff to the shed.
I'll make a bed for you on the floor.
Jake.
- He there?
- Nope.
Well, we can't wait forever.
The cattle are in the yards, so drink up.
- You gonna say something?
- Nope.
Not without my brother.
Where were you?
I couldn't make the boys hold back forever.
That's fine.
Uh...
Checked the power, and it's held up.
Not coming till morning.
Oh, no, thanks. Phil, they're ready for us next door at the Red Mill.
Dinnertime, boys.
Let's get a move on.
Twenty-five years ago, where were you, Georgie Boy?
Hmm?
- With you.
- I'll tell you.
A chubby know-nothing too dumb to get through college.
People helped you, fatso.
One person in particular taught you and me ranching
so we damn well succeeded.
- Bronco Henry.
- Hmm.
So...
So, to us brothers, Romulus and Remus, and the wolf who raised us.
- Bronco Henry.
- Bronco.
- Il Lupo.
- Bronco.
- Bronco Henry.
- Bronco Henry.
- Boss is leavin'.
- Dinner, boys.
Much obliged.
Rose?
Rose, play piano for us please.
I can't!
- Play! Play! Play!
- Come on!
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, ma'am. Fine.
I can play the piano.
Well, well...
ain't them purdy.
"I've never seen a woman behind the wheel of a car."
I said, "Have you never seen a lady drive a car before?"
He thought the dog was driving.
No. No.
No!
Oh, yeah.
Well...
I wonder what little lady made these.
Actually, I did, sir.
My mother was a florist.
So I made them to look like the ones in our garden.
Oh, well, do pardon me.
They're just as real as possible.
Mmm.
All right. Now, gentlemen, look.
See, that's what you do with the cloth.
- It's really just for wine drips.
- Ooh, you got that, boys?
Only for the drips.
Now get us some food.
- Did Bronco ever eat here?
- No, he did not.
So where did you eat?
Uh, back then we had herring at the saloon and a whole lot of alcohol.
Oh.
I remember this one time, Bronco made this wager that he could jump any horse
over the tables and chairs of the saloon piled up in the street.
Well, we chose him a nag all right.
It didn't bother him.
He took off his saddle,
walked the horse up to the tables and chairs,
talking to him all the while,
stroking his big, ugly head while the horse sniffed.
And then he swung on and rode him back and...
What?
Flew over.
He jumped it?
But to get a nag to jump... ain't heard of.
Put it down to amour.
What do you say, George?
Amour?
What... I don't know what you're talking about.
Do you mind quietening?
We're eating.
Shut that down, or I will!
Are you all right, Peter?
Where are you going?
Go on over. I'll settle up.
Settle in the morning.
I'll be along.
Shall I settle up now, Mrs. Gordon, or...
Please, you can...
send the bill, and I'll post a check.
Please, oh, please
Oh, do not let me fall
You're all mine
I love you best of all
You must be my girl
Or I'll have no girl at all
There'll be a hot time
In the old town tonight
When you hear
The bells a-dinglin'
All join 'round
And sweetly you must sing...
Come over here. I love you.
George?
George?
Brother.
Where have you been?
What you said about her boy tonight, Phil...
made her cry.
She had her ear to the door?
She was crying, Phil.
What the hell?
I said her boy needed to snap out of it and get human.
Pointed it out, that's all.
She should damn well know.
Hold it.
He's got it!
He was better before.
He's getting there.
Is that how Bronco Henry learned it?
I never saw him out on a lunge, that's a fact.
What is it you see up there, Phil?
Are animals up there?
Has anyone else seen what you've seen, Phil?
George?
Nah, not him.
Come on, Phil. What is it?
There is something there, right?
Not if you can't see it, there ain't.
Gotta be an animal.
Hello, Mr. Burbank.
Hello, Mrs. Gordon.
How can I help you?
I really just came to see you.
Oh.
I'm quite busy.
"This most wholesome sauce is excellent
with meats, fish, and cheese."
They have wine with them.
I wish they wouldn't do that.
I don't like drinking.
I'd say they have more in them than wine.
Sounds like booze.
They're early.
I should have never put the pianola in there.
Here's the water.
I see... I see the Herndon doctor and the undertaker, Mr. Weltz.
Oh, goodness. 
I wish Peter were here.
He should be serving the salad, and I need to fry the chicken.
Sometimes if you get food on the table...
Um, Mr. Burbank,
I'm gonna run and get Peter.
Afternoon!
Uh, looks like I'm the new waiter.
Doctor.
Mr. Burbank.
Mr. Weltz.
Run into any snow down below?
None to speak of.
Well, I guess I'll roll me a smoke since I'm woke up.
How far did you get?
Beech.
That's where I aimed for.
Beech?
Whatcha doin' down there, Georgie Boy?
Little tomcatting?
I was speaking to Mrs. Gordon.
Oh, yes.
She cried on your shoulder.
So she did.
Give her half a chance,
and she'll be after some dollar for Miss Nancy's college fee.
Remember how the Old Lady brought those girls out to the ranch
as soon as we could get hard-ons?
Oh my God.
Remember the tomato soup queen?
Wasn't it her that wrote you,
"I always will remember the western moon"?
Well, guess you coulda taken her out
without first putting a sack over her head.
Unlike some others.
Well, night, Phil.
It's a piece of ass you're after, fatso,
I'm damn sure you can get it without a license.
Hold it.
What do you do with these?
Goddamn.
Do you cut 'em up or something?
George has...
He's gone again?
...got himself... tangled
with a suicide... widow...
...and her half-cooked son.
A little desk for your big desk.
Phil.
Yep, got you, old-timer.
Did you write to the Old Lady?
Yeah, I dropped 'em both a line.
Did you say something about Rose?
Yeah, Rose...
Well, you know as well as I do what the Old Lady would feel
if she thought you were getting mixed up with her.
She'd likely have a hemorrhage.
The Old Lady would feel as one Mrs. Burbank would feel
for another Mrs. Burbank.
Come again?
We were married Sunday.
She got rid of her property in Beech.
Quit it.
Stand steady, you little bitch, huh?
Come on.
- Look at me, you little bitch!
- Huh? Yeah?
Quit it! You fat-faced bitch!
Whore!
My school boarders eat dinner at 6:00 p.m. sharp.
No dish-washing duty if he has homework.
Oh. No shoes inside.
Maybe you'd like to come to the ranch sometimes?
Won't that be nice?
May I keep some of these rose petals?
Hey, ho.
Take the rest for later.
I've been thinking we should have some sort of dinner party
to introduce you to my parents.
And perhaps we could invite the governor and his wife too.
I saw them in Herndon today, and, uh,
I... I kind of already mentioned it to them.
Uh, maybe you'd be kind enough to play something on our old piano.
But, George, I'm not very good.
I only played for the moving pictures.
You are plenty fine enough for us.
The Old Lady can't play a note, so...
If that's what you want.
This looks like a good spot.
Pull over here, please.
A good spot for what?
You are marvelous, Rose.
Stand beside me, George.
What's happening?
Follow me.
Left foot forward.
One, two, three.
And to the side.
One, two, three. And back.
One, two, three.
- To the side again. One, two...
- Sorry, I... I really can't.
- I really can't dance. I... 
- You're dancing.
Here. This foot forward.
Don't think.
One, two, three. To the side.
One, two, three. And back.
One, two, three.
I told you I'd teach you.
Forward, two, three.
Side, two...
What is it, George?
I just...
I wanted to say how nice it is
not to be alone.
Go on up and get out of the cold.
Hello, Phil.
You remember Rose?
- Oh, hello there.
- Hello.
- Something wrong with the furnace?
- Search me.
- I'll go down and shake it up.
- I've been hanging around for you all day.
There's a deed the Old Gent wants sent to him.
Well, I figure that can go till morning.
- You all right?
- I'm perfectly fine, George.
Well, brother Phil,
we had such a nice trip--
I'm not your brother.
You're a cheap schemer.
"We had such a nice trip."
Come on in.
This is the bathroom.
Just make yourself at home.
Yeah, that's fine.
All right.
Mm-hmm.
Now, you just make yourself comfortable.
Now, I'm going to bring you a surprise.
What is it?
Well, then it won't be a surprise.
When the rains come, the cellar gets flooded.
So, the rats all drown.
They float to the surface.
I have to get the young lads in to scoop 'em all up with a...
Please keep talking.
Don't mind me.
I like to keep busy.
Easy.
We got it.
Head to the right.
- Turn it around that way.
- Please, I'll take it.
- What is it?
- Head to the front door.
George. Is that...
Is that a grand?
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Whoa, hold it.
- It's a Mason & Hamlin baby grand.
Oh no, it's... it's too good for me.
I'm...
I'm just very average.
I... I only know tunes.
That's what I want, tunes.
The governor too.
We don't want a concert.
We just wanna hear you play, Rose.
- I should like to look on the governor...
- Easy.
...as he drives up and gets out of his vehicle.
- One step at a time, ready?
- Two, three, four.
- You make a rope with these?
- These strips? Yeah.
You boys find something needs doing.
Yes, sir.
I just came over to speak about something.
Come on, partner.
Open your talker. What is it?
His Nibs will be here for dinner and the Old Gent and the Old Lady.
Well, sir, ain't we going into society.
She on the pinano again?
Setting your teeth on edge?
No. Uh...
No, I... I like to hear Rose play.
Hmm.
Well, old-timer, what is it?
What's in the noodle?
Well...
Phil. 
I, uh...
- I just...
- Go on, spit it out.
- Well, it's about His Nibs, the governor.
- All right.
And, uh...
Well, it's not so much about His Nibs
but His Nibs' wife, actually, uh...
I was thinking His Nibs probably wouldn't mind so much,
but his missus might.
What, for dear Christ's sake?
Well, it's sort of a hard thing...
...to say.
Uh...
She might mind if you come to the table without a washup.
Yeah.
Hello, Mother, Father.
Hello.
The car's around the side.
Is there anyone with you?
My wife.
The napkin is fanned, so...
Light the fire.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.
We may as well try and warm this place.
Water, white wine...
Use your hand.
Use your hand like so.
They're here.
You keep warm.
I can bring them in.
Oh, how sweet.
They have their own umbrella.
- Orange blossoms.
- It's an island of civilization here.
Mmm.
I was, uh, telling Georgie about your brother.
Phi Beta Kappa at Yale, wasn't it?
Yes, in classics.
That's right.
So, uh... he swears at the cattle in Greek or Latin?
Yeah.
Uh, Rose plays the piano very well.
Do you?
That's a nice surprise.
I'll just go have a look-see out the back for Phil.
Oh, good.
I want to meet this brother.
Yes.
I suppose there was some sort of an injury.
Oh, Edward, Georgina.
Ah! Here are two people we can't fool.
Oh no, you cannot. We know everything.
We're walking encyclopedias.
At least I am.
I have nothing to do but read.
She's been reading
"The Curse of Tutankhamun" in The Digest.
So, uh, you believe in the curse?
Oh, no, no, I'm not drinking
George's concoction.
Yes, I do. But did you know that Tutankhamun was just a boy?
Only 18.
Phil, are you here?
I was looking for you.
Well, you found me.
Everyone's here.
And we're just about to eat.
They're asking after you.
Really?
Yes, we're counting on your conversation.
I shouldn't have said what I said to you about--
You two can keep your apologies to yourself. I'm not coming.
And what will I say?
The Old Lady wants to see you too.
She's come a long way.
You can tell them the truth.
That I stink and I like it.
Nothing could have happened to Phil, could it?
No, he'll be fine.
Something just must've come up.
So, Rose...
are you going to play for us?
Yes, George told me you play very well.
- Oh no, I'm terribly out of practice.
- Yes, we'd love that.
Come now, you've been playing a lot.
You know you have.
I don't know what to play.
Why,
play the one I like.
- What one?
- Why, the... the one about the Gypsy.
I... I can't seem to remember that one.
Just play anything.
I'm so sorry.
I can't seem to play.
I... I played in a cinema pit for hours and hours.
I'm... I'm so sorry.
Well, she got you halter trained, right, George? That's the main thing.
I'm so sorry.
No, it was a lovely, lovely evening.
Thank you.
Oh, you're Phil.
So, you weren't eaten by a cougar.
Not yet.
I am sorry to have missed your conversation.
I've heard you're brilliant.
You're gonna want to keep your distance.
I'm just off the horse.
Anyhows, you don't want conversation.
You've been listening to the pinano and dancing, I guess.
You dance?
You didn't play?
You sure did practice a terrible lot.
See, you wouldn't think there was much difference
between a cinema pit and a dinner party.
Where have you been, Phil?
I could hardly eat worrying about you.
I didn't get washed up, so I didn't come.
You didn't wash?
Oh, he's a ranchman, isn't that right?
That's honest dirt.
- Thank you, again.
- Thank you.
I'll just run and grab you a blanket for the ride.
All right, goodbye.
I wondered if you didn't think about
leaving your medical books here for the summer.
I thought about it, but... but you understand they were Dad's.
Turn around.
Are you eating?
I made a new friend.
He calls me Doctor, and I call him Professor,
'cause that's what we wanna be.
Why don't you invite your friend to the ranch?
No, Rose.
Why not?
Thank you.
I don't want him to meet a certain person.
A bull calf, boss!
Keep that leg stretched out!
You got him?
Grab his head!
I got it! I got it!
How come you don't wear gloves?
How 'bout 'cause they're not needed.
Castrate 1,500 head, then nick your thumb on the last.
Well, fatso, I think we're finished.
Who's that?
Miss Nancy.
Our waiter?
Yep, that's him.
You're gonna see him creeping all over the place now.
Big eyes goggling.
Little Lord Fauntleroy.
Rose?
Does he like his room?
Mm-hmm.
I think so.
Watch your fires. Summer's coming.
Which also means any Indians camping need to be moved off the property.
No exceptions.
We got animals they want to eat. Got it?
Yes, sir.
We don't sell hides.
We don't sell anything here.
Keep your eyes and ears open.
Maybe find yourselves an arrowhead up by them aspens.
Rose?
I have a headache.
Have a seat.
I'm not eating tonight.
It's George's week in town, so it's just Phil.
Mm-hmm.
I made a trap.
Oh no. It's... it's not a snake, is it?
It's a bunny.
Oh. Oh!
You're okay.
No, no, it's scared.
- Come here.
- Get it, Peter.
Come here. Come here. Come here.
Bring him to me.
Aw.
Don't worry about him.
You can eat in your room.
They dug up that graveyard to make way for the new highway.
Among those buried there was a friend of mine.
A clumsy tractor driver broke open the coffin,
and they found her hair had continued to grow after her death.
The whole coffin just stuffed with her lovely golden hair.
Except for a few feet from the end,
where it was gray.
Can I take it up?
- Some say she was a beauty.
- What?
Golden braids on top of her hair.
Oh! Yes, go and see.
It's very sweet.
- No, please. Get out of my room.
- Where's your rabbit?
I got it a carrot.
It doesn't want one.
Why?
Holy hell.
Shut the door.
Now, even if you're happy being in your room all day,
it's good for me.
- Mom, I have a lot to do.
- Come on.
Peter...
I thought you liked rabbits.
Yes. I do.
But if I want to be a surgeon,
I have to practice.
Well, you're not to kill them in the house, Peter.
No, I'm putting my foot down.
Oh, where'd a man be if he always did what his mother told him?
I'll score.
Whoa!
Point to Mrs. Burbank.
I know, Lola.
You don't have to...
You don't have to narrate it.
I'll just... remember.
- Whoo!
- Yeah, that was definitely out.
Lola, can you please take over?
I have a migraine.
Yeah.
- Where do you want me?
- Back there.
Yes, ma'am.
- I hit that way.
- I was aiming for you.
Don't listen to Bobby.
Are you all right, Mother?
I feel like my eyes are going to pop out of my head.
It's Phil, isn't it?
He's cold.
He's just a man, Peter, only another man.
You go ahead.
Yeah?
You want 'em off, do you?
You want 'em off?
Yeah, come on.
Yeah, you want 'em?
Yeah, you got 'em!
Get out of here, you little bitch!
You hear me?
Get out of here!
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord
Put whiskey in my bottle
Let the snow melt off
Wash away my sorrow
I feel
That honeymoon on me
I know you. Good worker.
I said, "Oh, Lord, oh, Lord"
"Oh, Lord, oh, Lord"
I said, "Oh, Daddy, oh, Daddy
Oh, Daddy, oh"
I said, "Oh, Daddy, oh, Daddy
Oh, Daddy, oh"
Jesus.
You boys wanna eat, come get it now.
Whoa, whoa.
No one tell him to soak those jeans?
Howdy, ma'am.
Little faggot.
Little Nancy.
Pete.
Hey, Pete.
Peter.
You want me, Mr. Burbank?
Well, I don't see any Mr. Burbank here.
I'm Phil.
Yes, Mr. Burbank.
I guess it's hard for a young'un like you to call an old fella like me
just plain Phil, at first.
Now come and take a look at this.
Have you done any braiding or plaiting yourself, Pete?
No, I never have, sir.
Peter, we kind of got off on the wrong foot.
- Did we, sir?
- Forget the "sir" stuff.
That can happen to people.
People who get to be good friends.
Well, you know what?
What?
What, Phil?
Now, you see?
You did it.
You called me Phil.
I'm gonna finish this rope and give it to you and teach you how to use it.
Sort of a lonesome place out here, Pete.
Unless you get in the swing of things.
Thank you... Phil.
How long do you expect it would take to finish that rope?
I could get it finished before you go back to school.
Well...
It won't be very long then, Phil.
Get on it.
You can sit on it, Pete.
Get yourself used to it.
You got any boots?
- Yes.
- You should wear 'em.
Don't let your mom make a sissy of you.
That's impressive, Phil.
Well, just by sitting there,
you're soaking up all the riding know-how you'll ever need and then some.
That saddle belonged to Bronco Henry.
Greatest rider I ever knew.
There's a cliff way out back of the ranch with initials and 1805 carved into it.
Must have been some fella from the Lewis and Clark Expedition.
They were real men in those days.
Let's say just you and me go out for a couple of days.
Find those trails and follow them to the end.
Wouldn't be surprised if there were gold
or precious minerals in them there rocks.
Do many of the calves die from wolves?
There's always a few that get... tore up or hamstrung or die of anthrax.
Call it blackleg.
You know, you talk like a Victrola record.
You know that?
No, I didn't know.
Yeah, well, you do.
- Did Bronco Henry teach you to ride, Phil?
- Yep.
He taught me to use my eyes in ways that other people can't.
Take that hill over there.
Most people look at it and just see a hill.
Where Bronco looked at it, what do you suppose he saw?
A barking dog.
- The hell, you just saw that now?
- No.
When I first came here.
See, it looks like a dog with its jaw wide open.
You... you just saw that?
Yeah.
Peter.
Peter.
Can't you come in and talk for a little?
You've gotten to be quite friendly with Phil, haven't you?
Is he nice to you?
He's making a rope for me.
Making a rope?
Peter, I wish you wouldn't make that sound with your comb.
I wasn't aware.
When I was little, I...
I felt a chill in my spine when I heard the chalk squeak on a blackboard.
Oh, Miss... 
Mrs. Merchant, that's who it was.
She... she drew chalk stars by our names on the blackboard.
I wonder why it was stars she gave us.
Why not diamonds?
Why not hearts?
Why not spades?
Why...
I wonder why it was always stars.
Because stars are supposed to be unreachable.
Yes.
But they weren't unreachable because she gave them to us.
- And, Peter?
- Hmm?
We had this valentine box, and it was covered with white crepe paper.
And we would paste big, red hearts on it.
Lopsided hearts.
And you had a great many valentines.
A great many?
Because you're beautiful.
Is there a sound that makes you shiver?
I don't remember.
We're not unreachable.
Hey.
No, we're not unreachable.
Mother, you don't have to do this.
I'll see you don't have to do it.
- This his first week?
- Nope, third.
Third?
Open up the gate.
Let him out.
- You sure? He's not ready.
- Go on. Let him out.
Yeehaw, cowboy! Whoo!
There you go!
Grab her by the reins!
- What you doing?
- Going to give him a hand.
Don't.
- Let him figure it out.
- Oh, oh!
Or not.
Fall off, you get back on.
Get her over!
Any happenings while I was away?
Boys dug the ditch.
Water's flowing good.
Fixing that stack there.
Hey, Pete!
Come here.
Peter?
Peter?
Where are you two off to?
We're going to the far field to fence off the stack there.
Peter?
- Rose?
- Peter!
Rose, what's the matter?
Rose?
Can't Peter go with you today?
Well, he could, but him and Phil have kinda paired up.
I don't want that.
- I don't want him to be with Phil at all.
- But, Rose...
He's helping him.
He taught him how to ride.
Hey, Pete, my pal.
Hey, Pete, my pal.
You gonna help?
You know who started riding as late as you?
- Who?
- Bronco Henry.
Hadn't done any of it till he was about your age now.
Hello, Mr. Cottontail.
Hey, Peter, let's see how long it takes
before Mr. Cottontail makes a run for the open.
Now, as kids, we used to take bets...
...on how many poles we'd remove
before the animals ran out and made a run for it.
Oh, he's still in there.
Gutsy little bugger.
I guess he has to be gutsy.
Damn son of a bitch.
Come on, now. Come on.
Think it broke his leg.
Well, put him out of his misery.
Hmm.
It's all right.
That's deep.
You okay, Phil?
Yeah, what the hell?
Must be a splinter.
You got a tan.
That's a cowboy tan you got.
Hmm.
Bronco Henry told me that...
a man was made by patience and the odds against him.
My father said...
obstacles.
And you had to try and remove them.
Another way to put it.
Well, you've certainly got obstacles.
That's a fact, Pete, me boy.
- "Obstacles"?
- Well, take your ma.
Today or any day...
how she's on the sauce.
"On the sauce"?
Drinking, Pete.
Boozing it up.
I guess you know she's been half-shot all summer.
Yeah, I know.
She never used to drink.
- Oh, didn't she now?
- No.
- She never did.
- But your pa, Pete?
My father?
Yeah, your father.
I guess he hit the bottle pretty hard?
The booze?
Until right at the very end.
Then he hung himself.
I found him.
Cut him down.
He used to worry I wasn't kind enough.
That I was too strong.
You, too strong?
He got that wrong.
Poor kid.
Things will work out for you yet.
Where's Mrs. Lewis?
She's with the Indians.
What Indians?
These ones.
You shouldn't even be here.
He won't like it.
Go now. Go.
Water!
They were standing right in front of the damn things asking,
"Do we have any hides?"
"Do we have any hides?"
Are they leaving?
Yes, they've got their horse going.
I told them the hides are gonna be burned.
Why?
Why are the hides going to be burned?
Phil doesn't want anyone else to have 'em.
Waits till there's a big pile and sets fire to the lot.
He'd blow up if they even touched 'em.
What's she doin'?
Please, please.
Wait! Please!
Wait! Please, stop.
Please wait.
Please.
Come back.
Take the hides.
It would be my honor if you would take them.
Please.
My husband owns the ranch.
Come back. Take them.
They're so soft.
So deliciously soft.
So beautiful.
- You all right, ma'am?
- Is she breathing?
Ma'am.
- Ma'am.
- What happened?
She just collapsed, sir.
Rose?
Sorry, sir.
Thank you, Lola.
Mine.
- Almost done.
- Howdy.
- Hey, boss.
- All right.
I'll be damned.
Is there something wrong, Phil?
Wrong?
For Christ's sake.
Every goddamn hide is gone!
Oh, she really put her foot into it this time.
You think she did it?
- She sold them?
- Bloody tootin'.
- Or maybe even gave them away.
- Why? Why?
Why would she do that, Phil?
She knew that we needed the hides.
Because she was drunk!
Pie-eyed!
She was smashed!
I'd think you'd know from the books your pa left you
that your ma's got a... a whatchamacallit.
Alcoholic personality.
It comes under the letter A!
- You're not gonna say anything to her?
- Say anything?
I won't say nothin'.
But sure as one good hell, brother George is going to.
Rose is not well, Phil.
She's ill.
Not well?
It is high time that that bozo and you got next to a few...
What do you ever call them?
Facts!
She stashes alcohol all around the place, even drinking in the stinking alley.
Look at your face in the mirror!
Is it that she could like?
Or our money? Wake the hell up!
That's enough, Phil.
Well, what is the harm?
The hides were only going to be burned.
I needed them.
I needed them.
Well, I apologize.
They were mine!
I needed them!
- Phil?
- Huh?
Phil, I've...
I've got rawhide to finish the rope.
You've got it?
What are you doing with rawhide?
I cut some up.
I wanted to be like you.
Please take what I've got.
Well...
That's damn kind of you, Pete.
Tell you something.
Everything's gonna be plain sailing for you from now on in.
And you know what?
I'm gonna work.
Finish up that rope tonight.
You'll watch me do it?
How old were you when you met Bronco Henry?
About the age you are now.
Was he your best friend?
Yeah... he was.
He was more than that.
Once, he saved my life.
We were way off up in the hills shooting elk, and the weather turned mean.
Bronco kept me alive by... lying body against body in a bedroll.
Fell off to sleep that way.
Naked?
- Phil left already?
- No, he's not here.
He say he was settin' out early?
No.
Good mornin'.
Have you seen your brother?
He's not had breakfast?
He's not been down at all.
Can I get some of that coffee please?
I'll run you into Herndon to see the doctor.
Phil...
what happened to your hand?
Let's get your boots off.
I'm... I'm good.
I'll get the car.
Let's go, Phil.
Where's the boy?
Phil.
I'll get it to him.
I'll take this one.
Uh...
Rose would like you to join us for Christmas, if you care to.
Yes.
Thank you, George.
I'm afraid I'm mystified.
I'll know in a day or two when the results come back.
Those last convulsions...
- Yes?
- Terrible, truly frightful.
You know what I'm thinking?
What?
Anthrax.
But he never handled diseased animals.
He was particular on that.

If people did not sometimes do silly things, nothing intelligent would ever get done.
Hello.
My name is Ludwig Wittgenstein.
I'm a prodigy.
I'm going to tell you my story.
I was born in 1889 to a filthy-rich family in Vienna.
I would like to introduce them to you.
(Fanfare)
- This is my mother, Leopoldine.
She was crazy about music.
In fact, she was so busy entertaining Brahms and Mahler that we were left with the 26 tutors and seven grand pianos.
Hermine, my oldest sister, was an amateur painter.
Gretyl married an American and was psychoanalysed by Freud.
Of Helene, we will remain silent.
Three of my brothers died young.
Hans ran away to America to escape dad, and disappeared off a boat in Chesapeake Bay.
Kurt's troops rebelled in the First World War and the shame drove him to suicide.
Rudolf, who was bent, spent most of his time in Berlin.
When he wasn't being theatrical, he hung out at the Scientific Humanitarian Committee.
He topped himself drinking a glass of cyanide in his favourite bar.
That leaves Paul. He was a concert pianist, but lost an arm in the war.
Ravel composed the
Concerto for the Left Hand especially for him.
And as for Dad, he was always in the office investing in American bonds.
That's how we escaped inflation and stayed rich - mega-rich - like the Rockefellers.
(Gentle music)
In art, it is hard to say anything as good as saying nothing.
Even to have expressed false thought boldly and clearly is to have gained a great deal.
Of time.
The horrors of hell can be experienced in a single day.
That's plenty of time.
(Murmurs)
(Babble of muttering)
I was to spend a lifetime disentangling myself from my education.
"Quite the best to be had in Vienna," Mum said.
I shared a history teacher with Adolf Hitler.
What a scream.

If someone is merely ahead of time, it will catch him up one day.
I am in England.
Everything around me tells me so.
MALE VOICE: Tell me how you're searching, and I'll tell you what you're searching for.
Who's that?
Hail, earthling.
Earthling?
I'm a philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein.
Who are you?
You could call me Mr Green.
May I ask you a question?
How many toes do philosophers have?
Ten.
Fascinating.
That's how many humans have.
Mr Green, philosophers are humans and know how many toes they have.
Oh dear.
Does that mean
Martians can't be philosophers?
- Oh, God.

LUDWIG AS AN ADULT: I escaped the family by going to Manchester University.
Manchester, an industrial town in the English north.
(Laughs) I remember my father saying,
"Where there's muck, there's brass."
Well, my aim was to be a pioneer in aeronautics.
But my experiments ended in a teenage failure and I gave up.
I abandoned my unsuccessful attempt to design an engine, and, like the English hero, Dick Whittington, went south to Cambridge to study philosophy with Bertrand Russell.
Why won't you just admit there's no rhinoceros in this room?
Because, Professor Russell, the world is made up of facts, not things.
Look for yourself.
I tell you for a fact, there is no rhinoceros in this room!
The issue is metaphysical, not empirical.
I thought the next big step in philosophy would be yours.
Now I am not so sure.
(Grunting)
Professor Russell.
Professor Russell.
(Crickets chirping)
Shh!
"Dear Ottoline,
Herr Schwinckel-Winkel, hard at it on universals and particulars.
He has the pure intellectual passion in the highest degree, and it makes me love him.
He says every morning he begins his work with hope, and every evening he ends in despair."
"We both have the same feeling that one must understand or die.
He is the young man one hopes for.
His disposition is that of the artist, intuitive and moody.
He affects me, just as I affect you.
I get to know every turn and twist of the ways in which I irritate and depress you
- from watching how..."
RUSSELL: "...he irritates and depresses me.
And at the same time I love and admire him.
His boiling passion may drive him anywhere. "
♪ GILBERT & SULLIVAN:
I Am Alone And Unobserved
♪ In short, my medievalism's affectation
♪ Born of a morbid love of admiration
God, the English are a queer bunch.
Lady Ottoline Morrell was the queerest.
She was fucking the gardener and Russell.
All the fun was in the country houses.
Everyone else was miserable.
Cambridge was miserable.
There was no oxygen there.
(Breathes hoarsely)
Can you imagine spending your evenings with those pretentious apostles?
I was no fun at parties.
The drunken chit-chat of British intellectuals bored me.
So, in desperation, I fled to Norway and built a small house on a fjord at the end of the world.
I started to write Notes On Logic.
How can I be a logician before I'm a human being?
The most important thing is to settle accounts with myself.
It's much easier here in Norway.
The solitude is bliss.
I can do more work here in a day than I can in a month around people.
Cambridge was absolutely unbearable!
A brothel.
Impossible to concentrate.
Here at last,
I feel... I'm solving things.
I've heard Herr Wittgenstein has gone to Norway.
I told him it would be dark.
He said he hated daylight.
I told him it would be Lonely.
He said he prostituted his mind talking to intelligent people.
I said he was mad.
He said God preserve him from sanity.
God certainly will.
Its shocking that he's never read Aristotle.
(Ticking)
LUDWIG: I don't merely have the visual impression of a pillar box.
I know this is a pillar box.
I know this is a hand.
And what is a hand?
This, for example.
It's a certain certainty.
I'm familiar with certainty.
I know this film studio is in Waterloo.
But how do I know that you are Ludwig Wittgenstein?
(Gentle piano music)
Ludwig, Ludwig!
I've just heard from Mother that you're going to join up.
Now, look, I understand wanting to do your bit in this terrible war, but why do you want to die in the trenches?
Why not get a clerical job in Vienna?
Because I want to go to the front.
Why put yourself at risk like this, Ludwig?
You've been exempted, for Christ's sake.
Standing eye to eye with death will give me the chance to be a decent human being.
I'll be doing something.
(Stab of piano chords)
I'm going as well.
We've got to do our duty.
(Dramatic piano music)
(Gunfire and artillery fire)
Where two principles meet which cannot be reconciled with one another, then each calls the other a fool or a heretic.
(Gunfire and artillery fire)
I'm hated because I'm a volunteer!
I'm surrounded by people who hate me.
The nearness of death will bring me the light of life.
God, enlighten me.
God, enlighten me!
I am a worm.
Pray God that I become a man.
God be with me.
God be with me!
Amen!
I know this world exists.
But its meaning is problematic.
Am I good or am I evil?
When my conscience upsets my equilibrium, then I am not in agreement with something.
What is it?
Is it the world?
Or is it God?
Wittgenstein has been taken prisoner.
Oh, how fascinating!
"I am a prisoner of war in Monte Cassino under the Italians.
I hope we shall see each other after the war.
Being shot at many times has altered the way I think about philosophy.
So has Tolstoy's Gospel In Brief.
I have written a book called
Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.
It combines logical symbolism with religious mysticism.
It's better with no shoes, no shoes at all.
Love, Ludwig."
I must send him some more cocoa tablets.
Sounds like he's rather depressed.
Does he know you've been in prison, Bertie?
I doubt it.
Such nice manners always, Ludwig.
Good stock.
What is logical symbolism?
Oh, it's too difficult to explain.
That's the trouble with you, Bertie.
You can never answer a straight question.
(Church bells ring)
I was released from prison camp on the 21st of August, 1919.
I wanted to get my Tractatus published, so I went back to Vienna.
(Dramatic piano music)
Ludwig!
Ludwig, what do you mean you want to teach in a rural school?
It would be like a precision instrument opening crates.
Look, you were decorated in the war.
Bertrand Russell says you're the great philosophical hope.
You can't go and teach in the provinces.
Hermine, you remind me of someone looking out through a closed window who cannot explain the strange movements of someone outside.
You can't tell what sort of storm is raging, or that this person might only be managing to stay on his feet with difficulty.
Well, I still think it's a waste of your talents.
If you hadn't been so daft and given all your money to us, you could publish your book yourself, without having to bow and scrape to publishers.
I don't want to force my philosophy on the world, if a publisher won't publish it.
Can't you understand that?
Well, I would rather have a happy person for a brother than an unhappy saint.
I am going to teach.
CHILDREN:? Three blind mice
"Those truth possibilities of its truth-argument which verify... and prositions...
I shall call its truth grounds..."
Yes, good.
Proposition. So what is this here?
What do you call this here?
Logic.
What's this here?
What do you call this here?
Teaching you is a... thoroughly... unrewarding experience.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
It's a waste of time.
It's a waste of my time, your time, everybody's time.
Do you understand...
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my dear, dear God!
Teaching proved to be a sham.
I had to "do a runner"...
...and lie about my brutality towards the children.
They just weren't any good at logic or maths, and they drove me crazy.
I kidded myself that my background and class weren't important, but I stood out like a sore thumb at these provincial schools.
The parents hated me and called me strange.
I felt guilty for years.
Somehow I had failed.
Morally.
This is a red pillar box.
How do you know that?
I've done my homework.
Green is green.
Children learn by believing adults.
Doubt comes after belief.
I know what I believe.
Where I come from there are no adults, and so no doubts.
If I post this letter to New York, does that strengthen my conviction that the earth exists?
The earth does exist.
And so do Martians.
(Xylophone)
(Ticking)
Well, you end the book with the line,
"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must remain silent."
Why didn't you?
I don't understand a word, Ludwig.
It's gobbledygook.
How much were you paid for this?
I was paid nothing for the rights, and will receive no royalties.
Typical. You won't be able to buy a pair of socks soon.
But I have published a book.
I heard that the book was only published because Bertrand Russell wrote an introduction.
LUDWIG: I have Russell's introduction.
He can't understand a word either.
HERMINE: Who can?
Hermine, we must improve ourselves.
That's all we can do to better the world.
Is it true you're designing Gretyl a brand-new house?
That's right. The whole thing.
Right down to the window latches and the door handles.
Well, I hope it's more comprehensible than your book.
(Phone rings)
Maynard?
- Maynard?
- Waistcoat!
Ah.
His book is obscure and too short.
But good.
My introduction got it published.
Yes, but I still think we should get him back to Cambridge.
Maynard, we're going to be late.
You're going to have to sort out his grants.
In a moment of amnesia, he gave away all his money to his brothers and sisters.
An absolute fortune, I'm told.
If I can sort out the economies of the world,
I ought to be able to sort out a stipend for Wittgenstein.
- That is, if Cambridge will still have him.
- Oh, I'm sure they'll have him.
His Tractatus is all the rage, whatever we may think of it.
Well, leave it to me, I know how to get him back.
Oh, er, Maynard, hold on a moment, I just...
Johnny, do you feel like a trip to Vienna?
Vienna?
(Choir chants)
Dr Wittgenstein.
Dr Wittgenstein.
I've come to take you home.
Home?
- Where's that?
- Cambridge.
Cambridge.
God help me.
I have letters from Mr Keynes and Mr Russell.
I should introduce myself.
Johnny.
Mr Russell asked me to tell you that you're the greatest philosopher of our time.
Well...
Tell me, Johnny, are you a philosopher?
Yes.
Are you happy?
You know, you really should give it up.
Get out while you still can.
(Graceful piano music)
Lydia!
Ah, Maynard.
God has arrived. He was on the 5:15 train.
Are you sure it's a good idea bringing him here,
Maynard?
I've heard he's difficult and peculiar.
A philosopher is a citizen of no community.
Does he make fit with Bloomsbury friends?
He seems so heavy-handed and Germanic.
Yes, he is.
Why are you all so interesting in him?
Because he's a genius, Lydoushka.
Yes, but what is he doing?
He's trying to define for us the limits of language.
And what it is to have communication, one with another.
Don't be so pompous.
Dearest darling, I am going to be pompous.
The country needs more than one decent philosopher.
Bertie needs some competition.
Our Viennese import might just do the trick.
Maynardoushka, your head is infinitely more flexible than my legs.
What are you doing?
Everyone's waiting for you.
Go away, please!
They're torturing me!
For God's sake, just open your mouth and say the first thing that comes into your head.
Don't be so ridiculous.
Listen, just get through this seminar and we can go to the cinema.
A dog... cannot lie.
Neither can he be sincere.
A dog may be expecting his master to come.
Why can't he be expecting him to come next Wednesday?
Is it because he doesn't have language?
If a lion could speak, we would not be able to understand what he said.
Why do I say such a thing?
If we could understand him, I shouldn't think we'd have too much trouble with a lion.
We could get an interpreter.
Do you mean for me or for the lion?
Yes, yes, we...we could get an interpreter.
But what possible use would that be?
To imagine a language is to imagine a form of life.
It's what we do and who we are that gives meaning to our words.
I can't understand the lion's language, because I don't know what his world is like.
How can I know the world a lion inhabits?
Do I fail to understand him because I can't peer into his mind?
(Whispering)
What's going on behind my words, when I say, "This is a very pleasant pineapple"?
No, please, take your time.
STUDENT: The thought, Professor.
I see.
And what is the thought that lies behind the words, "This is a very pleasant pineapple"?
This is a very pleasant pineapple.
Listen to me.
We imagine the meaning of what we say as something queer, mysterious, hidden from view.
But nothing is hidden!
Everything is open to view!
It's just... it's just philosophers who muddy the waters.
STUDENT: Professor Wittgenstein.
You can't know this pain.
Only I can.
Are you sure you know it?
You don't doubt you had a pain just then?
How could I?
If we can't speak of doubt here, we can't speak of knowledge either.
I don't follow.
It makes no sense to speak of knowing something in a context where we could not possibly doubt it.
Therefore to say, "I know I am in pain," is entirely senseless.
When you want to know the meaning of a word, don't look inside yourself, look at the uses of the word in our way of life.
Look at how we behave.
Are you saying there are no philosophical problems?
There are... linguistic, mathematical, ethical, logistic and... religious problems, but there are no genuine philosophical problems!
You're trivialising philosophy.
Philosophy is just a by-product of misunderstanding language!
Why don't you realise that?
Oh, dear. He can't bear disagreement, can he?
What are you doing?
Making notes on your class before I forget it.
Are you mad? You'll ruin the plot.
Shh.
There is no plot.
There might be.
Put it away.
Put it away this instant.
What did you say about Fortnum & Mason?
Don't be ridiculous.
LUDWIG AS AN ADULT: There was no competition between the cinema and seminar.
I loved films.
Especially westerns and musicals.
Carmen Miranda and Betty Hutton were my favourite actresses.
I always sat in the front row.
Film felt like a shower bath, washing away the lecture.
I hated the newsreels.
Far too patriotic.
I felt the makers must have been master pupils of Goebbels.
As for playing the national anthem at the end,
I'd sneak out.
(Graceful piano music)
Come on, Maynard!
Speed it up.
Can't go any faster, it's making me giddy.
Should I go any faster, Ludwig?
No, no, you keep going as you are. Come on
Maynard, keep it up, keep it up, keep it up!
You're slowing the whole thing down.
I'm done for.
You've ruined the whole thing!
We were just getting into rhythm.
Go away and play with someone else!
All right.
You can be the sun this time. It's easier.
I'll be the earth, and Lydia can be the moon.
We take rest.
Take tea.
Come along, Maynard.
Oh, dear.
I wonder where I went wrong?
Oh, Bertie, do listen to this.
It's Julian Bell's satirical poem of Ludwig.
"For he talks nonsense, numerous statements makes
Forever his own vow of silence breaks
Ethics, aesthetics, talks of day and night and calls things good or bad and wrong or right
Who on any issue ever saw
Ludwig refrain from laying down the law?
In every company he shouts us down and stops our sentence stuttering his own
Unceasing argues, harsh, irate and loud, sure that he's right and of his rightness proud
Such faults are common, shared by all in part, but Wittgenstein pontificates on art"
WittersGitters, WittersGitters, WittersGitters!
Fairy, fairy, fairy!
Idiot!
What does this mean?
It's a gesture of contempt.
A cyclist did this to me as I was crossing the road.
I decided then and there to kill myself.
Are you coming to the Palladium with us this evening?
What's the logical structure of this gesture?
It doesn't have one!
That means I've spent most of my life groping down a blind alley.
Isn't it rather an over-reaction to kill yourself, because somebody gives you a V-sign?
Philosophy hunts for the essence of meaning.
There's no such thing.
There's no such thing!
Just the way we do things in everyday life and things like that.
The college porter knows that.
Is that what you're planning to do for the rest of your life?
L-I shall start by committing suicide.
Champagne before you go?
Um, do you know... l-I'd love a cup of tea.
How like a philosopher to hate philosophy.
He thinks ordinary working people have the answers.
He wants me to give up philosophy.
Perhaps I should.
Philosophy just states what everyone admits.
How does philosophy take the measure of this?
It's not supposed to.
It'd be like complaining that you can't play a tune on a carrot.
Precisely.
Do you think philosophy is useless?
Oh, no.
It serves Ludwig as a therapy.
Are you going to take his advice?
I was destined for the pit.
My parents gave up everything to get me here.
I'd be quite happy to go back, but it would break their hearts.
Well, what about Aristotle?
What about Aristotle?
L-I've never read Aristotle.
What can he tell us, anyway?
The answers are in Tolstoy,
Dostoevsky and Saint Matthew.
How marvellous!
I didn't know you were a Christian, Ludwig!
I'm not.
It's just that I look at everything from a religious point of view.
Why is there anything at all rather than just nothing?
Well, how the bloody blue blazes should I know?
I'm the woman. You are the philosopher.
The most important part of my philosophy hasn't been written.
I can't write it. It can never be written.
Oh, bunkum! A full English breakfast and a spot of application.
It doubt it'll be understood in the future.
People, culture, the air, everything will be different in the future.
We're mutating.
You know, your obsession with perfection is quite, quite ludicrous.
I want to be perfect, don't you?
Christ, no.
- Then I don't see how we can be friends.
- Neither do I.
I used to believe that language gave us a picture of the world.
But it can't give us a picture of how it does that.
That would be like trying to see yourself seeing something.
How language does that is beyond expression.
That is the mystery.
That was all wrong.
Language isn't a picture at all.
What is it, then?
It's...
...a tool.
An instrument.
There isn't just one picture of the world, there are lots of different language games, different forms of life, different ways of doing things with words.
They don't all hang together!
What do you mean?
All I mean is the limits of my language are the limits of my world.
We keep running up against the walls of our cage.
I'm terribly sorry.
You have a worthless teacher today.
I...
I'm all cleaned out.
Please forgive me.
That was quite masterly.
- It was frightful.
- I don't know.
Made me feel like a vegetable.
How could it possibly?
It doesn't feel like anything to be a vegetable.
STUDENT: I just can't see it, Professor.
It somehow just seems natural to me to say,
"I know I'm in pain."
Oh... natural.
Tell me, why does it seem more natural for people to believe that the sun goes round the earth, rather than the other way round?
Well, obviously, because it looks that way.
I see.
Then how would it look if the earth went round the sun?
Erm... well, I suppose...
Yes, I see what you mean.
LUDWIG AS A BOY: Seminar, flick.
(Gunfire and Native Americans whooping)
Seminar.
(Cavalry trumpet)
Seminar.
Flick.
Seminar.
Flick.
LUDWIG AS AN ADULT: On and on it went.
Cambridge, Cambridge, Cambridge.
No wonder everyone dreamed of Moscow.
Keynes and Russell had both been there.
Bertie, always the opportunist, wrote a shilling shocker called
The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism.
He condemned it out of hand.
But, as everyone knows, the best of the Cambridge lot became spies.
My dream was to go to the Soviet Union and work as a manual labourer.
I've fixed you up a job with a local engineering firm.
Why?
I thought you'd be pleased.
You'd be working with your hands.
You should do something useful.
But Ludwig, my training's academic.
That's the challenge.
I'm going to Russia.
I shall try to find us both manual jobs there.
Why do you want to go to Russia?
Oh, by the way, you'll have to lend me a tie.
Professor Wittgenstein, on behalf of the Institute for Foreign Relations, I can offer you two things.
The chair in philosophy at Kazan University or a teaching post in philosophy at Moscow University.
Er, comrade, please.
I don't want to teach.
I want to work as a manual labourer, either in a factory or on a collective farm.
But, Professor, eto nyevozmozhno.
O chem vy govoritye?
Nyeuzheli vy nye ponimayetye?
Nu, kakoy iz vas kolkhoznik? Eto absurd.
Chto?
I'm terribly sorry, Professor Wittgenstein, but this is absolutely out of the question.
The one thing that is not in short supply in the Soviet Union is unskilled labour.
Da.
Da, da, Professor.
We must teach the frozen circumstances to sing by playing them their own melody.
Professor Wittgenstein,
I do recommend you to read more Hegel.
Eto shutka.
I couldn't possibly read Hegel.
I'd go stark raving mad.
Tell me, have you read Trotsky on art?
That's much more interesting.
Nyet, Professor, ya nye chitala Trotskogo.
Trotskiy - eto opasno.
Professor, ya nye ponimayu vas.
Vy priyezhayetye v Moskvu, vy khotitye rabotat' v kolkhozye, vy khotitye, chtoby ya chitala
Trotskogo. No Trotskiy - eto opasno.
Trotsky - eto Sibir'.
Vy ponimayetye? Trotsky - eto Sibir'.
(Bell)
- Sleduyushchiy.
Next one.
How was Russia?
Well, at least Lenin's state has ensured that there's no unemployment.
It is an ordered society.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Yes, I am.
You were right.
- Did you find yourself a job in Russia?
- Sadly, no.
It looks like I'm stuck with Cambridge and philosophy.
Ludwig, give it up.
What the hell are you playing at, Ludwig?
I've just been talking to Johnny.
What do you mean?
I mean all this poppycock about engineering and him getting a job.
What do you think his parents will think?
I haven't the foggiest.
Johnny's parents are working people.
His father's a miner.
They sacrificed everything they have to get him to Cambridge.
What's Johnny's parents got to do with it?
Listen, Wittgenstein,
Johnny's parents are workers.
That's what you admire, when it's confined to the pages of Tolstoy.
I've never met Johnny's parents.
I strongly advise you not to.
You're foisting your own self-hatred onto their son.
You've been reading Sigmund Freud.
What of it?
It's dangerous stuff!
Believe me!
It takes one Viennese to know another.
Freud's nothing to do with Johnny sweating it out in some god-awful factory.
You can't do this, Wittgenstein.
You can't use Johnny as fodder for your own fantasies.
What I do is none of your business.
It's my business to stop you from... oh, what's your word,
"infecting" too many young men.
You have a terrible power over them, can't you see that?
Half of Cambridge goes around imitating your mannerisms.
You know I've never encouraged disciples.
I'm talking about you, not your ideas.
You lord it over others and you don't even know it.
All aristocrats idealise the common folk, as long as they keep stoking the boilers.
I should know, I was brought up like that, too.
If you're talking about my upbringing, that was a long time ago!
In another country!
How can I possibly speak to a man who believes I corrupt others?
I'm simply quoting your own words.
Russell,
I would like you to know that our friendship is now over.
I had a fearful row with Russell yesterday.
He said I was an evil influence.
What is worrying you, Ludwig?
Is it your logic or your sins?
Both.
My sins mostly.
Sins, sinners, sinning.
What nonsense you do talk.
Well, you mustn't expect any sympathy from me. I'm not a virtuous man.
I never imagined you were.
Do you know, Maynard, every hour, every day,
I keep my feet with the greatest difficulty, and the slightest gust of dishonesty would be enough to bowl me over forever.
That's why people think I'm so strange.
I don't know what to say to you.
You're suffering from a terminal case of moral integrity.
If you'd just allow yourself to be a little more sinful, you'd stand a chance of salvation.
Salvation is the only thing that concerns me.
And I know we're not here to have a good time.
Spoken like a true Protestant.
Ludwig, my dear, there's nothing in the world like the warmth of a sated body.
For me, it's as if I'm being burnt by a freezing wind.
Pull yourself together.
Philosophy is a sickness of the mind.
I mustn't infect too many young men.
How unique and irreplaceable Johnny is.
And yet, how little I realise this when I am with him.
That's always been a problem.
But living in a world where such a love is illegal, and trying to live open and honest is a complete contradiction.
I have...known...Johnny three times.
And each time I began with feeling that there was nothing wrong.
But after,
I felt shamed.
JOHNNY: What are you thinking?
Oh, just some...
...idea.
What idea?
Well, for many years at the centre of philosophy was a picture of the lonely human soul brooding over its private experiences.
Yeah, everyone knows that.
This soul is a prisoner of his own body, and he's locked out from contact with others by the walls of their bodies.
I wanted to get rid of this picture.
There is no private meaning.
We are what we are... only because...
...we share a common language and common forms of life.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
(Like a toff) Yes.
Yes, I'd like that very much. Yes, Wednesday.
Oh, does that suit you?
It suits me fine, yes.
Yes. I thought so, yes.
Yes, he was. Really?
Oh, Bertie? Yes, I know, yes, yes.
For many years, yes.
(Normal voice) Christ!
Professor, you once said the Tractatus had solved all the problems of philosophy.
Yes.
So I thought at the time.
What I meant was that I tried to show the sort of things that philosophy could say, and these aren't really important.
What's much more important is all the things it can't articulate.
Doesn't cut the mustard, philosophy?
- You think.
- That's right.
So I thought at the time.
In fact, I still think so, but for different reasons.
Now, talking about your more recent work, the Philosophical Investigations and so on.
That's right. In this later work I abandoned the idea that language is a sort of picture.
That's just a misleading metaphor.
I mean, you might say that the word "handbag" is a picture of a handbag.
But what about words like "hello",
"perhaps", "oh, hell", what do they give us a picture of?
So how would you now define the relationship between language and the world?
Oh, in lots of different ways.
My mistake had been to think that there was only one way of talking at stake here.
I came to see that there are lots of different things we do with language.
Different language games, as I call them.
And the meaning of the word is just the way it's used in a particular language game.
And what do you now believe the task of philosophy to be?
Philosophical puzzles arise because we tend to mix up one language game with another.
For example, people puzzle over the nature of something they call the "soul".
But this may just be because they're thinking of the soul along the lines of a physical object.
They're confusing one way of talking with another.
The job of philosophy is to sort out these language games?
Exactly.
They're all perfectly in order as they are.
Philosophy in no sense can question them.
Philosophy leaves everything exactly as it is.
Professor Wittgenstein, you've been associated with the argument that there can't be a private language.
Could you explain this a little?
What I mean is this, we learn to use words, because we belong to a culture.
A form of life.
A practical way of doing things.
In the end, we speak as we do, because of what we do.
And all this is a properly public affair.
Philosophers in the tradition of Descartes start from the lonely self, brooding over its private sensations.
I want to overturn this centuries-old model.
I want to start from our culture, our shared practical life together, and look at what we think and feel, and say it in these public terms.
Professor, thank you very much.
I'm thinking of going away.
Not again, Ludwig.
You've spent your entire life running away.
I'm serious, Maynard.
Where to this time?
Norway? Vienna?
Swansea?
Not the Soviet Union again?
What's wrong with the Soviet Union?
The place is one enormous labour camp.
There's nothing wrong with labour.
There is if they shoot you for not doing it.
I want to give up teaching philosophy and concentrate on my book.
Why not do it in Cambridge, and be paid?
I'm going to Ireland to live by the sea.
In Ireland they shoot you if you work.
Oh, Ludwig.
I know,
I'm a complete bloody disaster.
We love you.
(Waves lap gently)
Dr Wittgenstein.
Oh, you're here. Good.
At last.
You couldn't have chosen a more remote place.
Well, how's the work on your book?
Creeping along.
That means you've penned a masterpiece.
What's the news from the doctor?
- It's not good, I'm afraid.
- I hope it's not anything serious.
Last week I saw a specialist in Dublin.
I have cancer of the prostate.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It responds well to hormone treatment at early stages.
Is there anything I can do?
Don't think I'm afraid of dying.
It's death that gives life its meaning and shape.
You can take me back to Cambridge.
I don't want to die here.
Any time you like.
You know,
I'd quite like to have composed a philosophical work which consisted entirely of jokes.
Why didn't you?
Sadly, I didn't have a sense of humour.
Let me tell you a little story.
There was once a young man who dreamed of reducing the world to pure logic.
Because he was a very clever young man, he actually managed to do it.
When he'd finished his work, he stood back and admired it.
It was beautiful.
A world purged of imperfection and indeterminacy.
Countless acres of gleaming ice stretching to the horizon.
So the clever young man looked around the world he'd created and decided to explore it.
He took one step forward and fell flat on his back.
You see, he'd forgotten about friction.
The ice was smooth and level and stainless.
But you couldn't walk there.
So the clever young man sat down and wept bitter tears.
But as he grew into a wise old man, he came to understand that roughness and ambiguity aren't imperfections, they're what make the world turn.
He wanted to run and dance.
And the words and things scattered upon the ground were all battered and tarnished and ambiguous.
The wise old man saw that that was the way things were.
But something in him was still homesick for the ice, where everything was radiant and absolute and relentless.
Though he had come to like the idea of the rough ground, he couldn't bring himself to live there.
So now he was marooned between earth and ice, at home in neither.
And this was the cause of all his grief.

# Women.on.the.Verge.of.a.Nervous.Breakdown.1988.es.utf8.srt
Hace meses me mudé a este apartamento de azotea con Iván.
El mundo se hundía a mi alrededor... y yo quería salvarme y salvarlo.
Me sentía como Noé.
En el corral que instalé en la terraza... me hubiera gustado tener una pareja de todas las especies animales.
En cualquier caso... no conseguí salvar la pareja que mas me interesaba: la mía.
Pepa, cariño..
No quiero oírte nunca decir
"Soy infeliz".
Tu Iván.
Mi vida sin ti no tiene sentido.
¿Quieres casarte conmigo?
Mil y una noches no serian suficientes.
No puedo vivir sin ti.
Te quiero, te deseo, te necesito.
Aquella noche en la selva fue maravillosa.
¿Por qué no nos casamos por segunda vez?
Eres la geisha de mi vida.
Sayonara.
No me importa el éxito si tu estas a mi lado.
Estoy dispuesto a aceptarte como eres.
Mi vida, hay cosas inequívocamente americanas.
Estoy a tu disposición.
- Te acepto como eres, cariño.
- Pues mira qué bien.
¿A cuantos hombres has tenido que olvidar?
Dime algo agradable.
Engañame.
Dime que siempre me has esperado.
Dímelo.
Dime que te hubieras muerto si no vuelvo.
Dime que aun me quieres como yo te quiero.
Gracias.
Muchas gracias.
Comunicame con estos dos números.
Bueno, primero te comunico con uno y después con el otro, ¿eh?
Pepa.
Pepa.
Cariño, ¿te has dormido?
Como tengo prisa, hemos empezado sin ti.
Oye. Mete mis cosas en la maleta.
Me voy mañana de viaje.
Iré a recogerla ya despedirme de ti... pero te llamaré antes.
Si no quieres verme, déjamela en la portería.
Gracias por tu comprensión el otro día.
Creo que no me la merezco.
Bueno, cariño, te llamaré.
¿Iván?
"EXA". Dígame.
¿Está Iván?
Acaba de llamarme.
Uy, pues mira, acaba de salir ahora mismo, linda.
Oye, el que esta aquí furioso es a tu director. Como no llegaste.
Si. Te paso con él, si.
Germán, lo siento.
Anoche no me podía dormir y me tomé un somnífero.
Bueno, no te preocupes. Ya hemos hecho lo de Iván. Pero ven ya para acá.
Voy enseguida.
Bueno, antes tengo que recoger unos análisis, en Vía del Paso.
De acuerdo, pero no te entretengas.
Hasta luego.
Qué suerte tienen algunas.
Ahora lo comunico con su radio taxi.
¿Quién me pidió un radio taxi?
Por favor, quien haya pedido un radio taxi, venga a la centralita, por favor.
Cuídese. Y no fume... y coma bien.
Lo demás, no se preocupe.
Sr. Salcedo, vaya al teléfono por favor.
Ya era hora.
Te esperan en la siete.
¿Me llamo otra vez Iván?
No. Ay, Olvídalo ya, chica.
Estoy en ello.
Pero dame tiempo, si no te importa.
Y corta la megafonía.
Oye, dame ese papel!
Dame ese papel!
- Perdón a todos.
- Bueno, vamos.
Arturo, ¿aceptas... a Eugenia como esposa... y prometes serle fiel, en las alegrías y en las penas... en la salud y en la enfermedad, todos los días de tu vida?
Si, creo que quiero.
¿Y tu, Eugenia? ¿Eugenia?
Dígame, padre.
¿Quieres a Arturo por esposo?
Claro que quiero.
Como no voy a querer.
Lo que Dios ha unido, que no lo separe el hombre.
¿Podemos besarnos ya, padre?
Hija mía, no debes confiar en ningún hombre.
¿Ni en mi marido siquiera?
No. Toma. Toda precaución es poca.
Bueno, ya esta.
Lo voy a controlar enseguida.
Pasa ya la proyección.
- Tu vas a ensayos, ¿verdad?
- Gracias.
Toma. Bebe.
No tengo sed.
Con esto podrás dormir.
Ya lo intenté y no me sirvió de nada.
A cuantos hombres has tenido que olvidar?
A tantos como mujeres recuerdas tu.
No te vayas.
No me he movido.
Dime algo agradable.
Si.¿Qué quieres que te diga?
Engañame. Dime que siempre me has esperado. Dímelo.
Todos estos anos te he esperado.
Dime que te hubieras muerto si no vuelvo.
Estaría muerta si no hubieras vuelto.
Dime que aun me quieres como yo te quiero.
Aun te quiero tanto como tu a mi.
Gracias. Muchas gracias.
Pepa.¿Estas bien?
Si, no es nada.
Voy un momento al baño.
Pero qué descarada eres, Pepa.
Comunicame con este numero, por favor.
No tienes ningún derecho a hacer esto, Pepa.
No importa. Márcamelo.
Estas haciendo el ridículo, Pepa.
Ya lo hice bastante.
Un poquito mas ya no importa.
- Estuviste llorando, ¿no?
- Si.
¿Ves? ¿Lo ves?
Yo ya lo sabía, Pepa.
Me lo marcas tu o llamo desde la calle.
Me están esperando en el estudio.
Si, si, perdón, perdón.
Su servidora esta aquí para eso, ¿eh?
El café puede esperar.
He desayunado mucho en los últimos anos.
El numero de la otra.
No aprende.
Ella no aprende.
Ella no. Ella no es profesora, como otras. Ella...
Nada.
- Quién es?
- Pepa Marcos. ¿Esta Iván?
- Perdone que la moleste.
- No pienso perdonarla.
Tengo que hablar urgentemente con él.
¿Como se atreve a llamar aquí?
Por favor, señora, no me grite.
Acabo de sufrir un desmayo.
Por mi, se le puede parar el Corazón!
No se preocupe.
Entre Iván y yo no hay nada.
- Váyase a la mierda!
- Váyase a la mierda Ud. también!
Pero dígale que me llame.
Pepa, cariño, perdóname.
No sabia que te habías desmayado.
Ay, pobrecita.
Es el colmo!
No se te ocurra defenderla!
- Mama.
- ¿Si?
Quiero hablar contigo.
Ahora no. Estoy pintándome la linea de los ojos. Me pones nerviosa.
Bueno. Pues después, ¿eh?
Después. Después.
¿Qué pasa?
Esa perra con la que se estuvo acostando
Iván se ha atrevido a llamar.
Iván debería ser mas discreto y no dar este numero.
¿Por qué no los habrá tirado en su momento?
Porque papa no te lo permitió.
Dámelos. Podría venderlos en la tienda.
Me gusta usarlos.
Así tengo la impresión de que no ha pasado el tiempo.
Pues siento decirte que si ha pasado.
No seas grosera, Carmen.
Déjala que se ponga lo que quiera.
Eso. Mimalá.
Así no se recuperara nunca.
Déjame que te ayude.
- Sujeta eso.
- Por aquí.
¿Te gusto?
Estas estupenda.
Qué bien mientes, papa.
Por eso te quiero.
¿No la encuentras un poco oscura?
- No.
- Yo tampoco.
- Buenas tardes. ¿Interrumpo?
- No. ¿Como está?
- Bien.
- ¿Y el apartamento de azotea, qué tal?
- Contenta, ¿no?
- Maravilloso, pero quiero alquilarlo.
No se preocupe que le vamos a sacar un buen precio.
Qué bien, porque también quiero alquilar uno para mi.
¿Puedo hacer una llamada?
Llevo todo el día afuera.
¿De qué características?
Pues con una terraza mas grande, pero mas pequeño.
- ¿Y el suyo era Montalbán 7?
- Si. Séptimo "A".
Y 220 metros, con la terraza incluida.
Su maqueta tuvo mucho éxito.
Todo el mundo me pregunta por ella.
Salio muy bien.
Este cretino no me llamo.
- ¿Cuanto te debo?
- 200.
- ¿Esta Isabel?
- Si, pero esta ocupada.¿Qué querías?
- Dile que tengo que verla.
- Un momento.
Hola.
¿Te animas a ponerte una mascara?
- No, hoy no, estoy apurada.
- Es gratis.
Nos están haciendo una demostración aquí dentro.
Pero lo que yo necesito son pastillas para dormir.
Se me han terminado.
- ¿Traes la receta?
- No. Te la traigo esta tarde o mañana.
Si no tomo algo, no pego un ojo.
- Esta bien.
- Gracias.
- En persona no vale nada.
- Esta mucho mas delgada que en la tele.
Pepa, tesoro, estas?
No estas?
Como no te encuentro, voy a acabar preocupándome.
Igual que yo.
Por lo visto, hoy no tengo suerte contigo, bueno...
¿Qué?
Presiento que estas huyendo de mi y no te lo reprocho.
Qué falso eres, hijo.
Te llamaré.
Volveré a insistir.
- A ver si tengo suerte otra vez.
- Si.
Es que tengo muchas ganas de hablar contigo.
- Te echo de menos.
- Ya lo veo.
Bueno, un beso.
Hasta luego.
Pedazo de mierda.
Pepa, soy Juan, de la inmobiliaria.
Mañana le mando una pareja que esta interesada en el apartamento.
Trate de estar ahí por la mañana.
Gracias.
Estoy harta de ser buena.
No debería fumar.
Por fin me libro de toda esta mierda!
Y de esta flor estúpida!
Y un pato. ¿A quién se le ocurre regalar un pato?
Solo a ti.
Pero ahora me libro de todo.
Y tu, mira!
"Ha sucedido algo imprevisto que nos afecta a los dos.
Es urgente que hablemos de ello antes de irte de viaje".
Siga a ese taxi!
Creía que eso solo pasaba en las películas.
Tome lo que quiera.
Invita la casa.
Muchas gracias. Lo que quiero es que no pierda de vista a ese taxi.
No se preocupe.
Esta todo bajo control.
¿Le molesta el mambo?
Tengo de todo.
Música heavy, rock, soul... cumbias, tengo sevillanas.
Salsa, tecno-pop, jotas... lo que quiera.
- Si quiere, le quito el mambo.
- El mambo me encanta.
Es que el mambo... es lo que mejor va con este tipo de decoración.
Ud. es la de la tele, ¿eh?
La madre del asesino.
Ay, qué graciosa.
Si no le importa,
¿me firmaría un autógrafo?
Es para mi chica.
Por favor, ponga algo personal.
- ¿Como se llama?
- Azucena.
- Yo creo que se ha parado.
- ¿Qué dirección es ésta?
Almagro 38.
Lo que no sé es el piso.
Nos ha saludado.
Esta se ha dado cuenta.
Por mi.
Bueno, ¿y ahora adonde vamos?
Montalbán 7, y gracias.
Mujeres, aquí tienen a su galán de noche.
Espero que si haga algo, porque lo que es a mi...
Tranquilas. Esto es para la comida y este palo también lo pueden usar.
Pueden usarlo y cagarlo todo lo que quieran.
Tu. Salta aquí. Salta!
No salta. Le repugna.
Bueno, pues me voy a seguir esperando.
Almagro 38.
Almagro 38.
Almagro... Almagro...
Almagro.
31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 38.
41 0-0430.
Claro.
Es la misma que me insulto esta mañana!
Hola.
Soy la madre del famoso asesino de "Cuatro Caminos".
Cuando mi hijo vuelve a casa después de cometer uno de sus famosos crimines... me trae la ropa que es algo de no creer.
Donde estala ropa que llevaba su hijo anoche?
En el momento del crimen.
Pues aquí está.
Mire qué hermosura.
- Ni rastro de sangre.
- Ni de vísceras.
Parece mentira.
"Ecce Omo".
Parece mentira.
Un grupo armado Chiita ha sido capturado hoy en Madrid... según informan fuentes policiales.
Un portavoz de la comunidad Chiita residente en Madrid... asegura que dicho comando ha actuado por cuenta propia... sin la menor vinculación con dicha comunidad.
Las mismas fuentes policiales... han prometido mayor información... para las próximas horas... una vez terminados los interrogatorios.
Ay, mi libro!
Iván, tengo que verte urgentemente para hablar de una cosa contigo.
Déjame un recado en el contestador diciéndome tu donde y cuando.
Yo ahora mismo me voy a la calle a buscarte. Adiós.
Pepa, soy Candela.
Necesito verte.
Salgo en este momento.
Llámame después.
- Es que estoy metida en un lío.
- Yo también, o sea que adiós.
Pepa! Pepa, por Dios, te necesito!
- Pepa, soy yo.
- Ay, qué pesada, por Dios!
Pepa, levanta el teléfono.
Estoy metida en un gran lío.
"De tu padre que no te merece, Iván".
- ¿Pero qué hace?
- Iba a llamar por teléfono.
Pues, llame!
- Qué escándalo!
- Lo siento, Marisa.
- Y esa ramera bailando en la ventana!
- ¿Qué ramera?? Donde?
¿No iba a llamar Ud. ¿
Entonces, ¿qué esta esperando?
Vámonos.
Recoge todo y ven conmigo.
"Ha sucedido algo imprevisto que nos afecta a los dos.
Es urgente que hablemos de ello antes de irte".
Tire eso a la basura!
Por favor, Dios, que haya llamado.
Pepa, son las 5:00 de la mañana.
Estoy enfrente de tu casa y tu no estas.
.Estoy sube para arriba, baja para abajo y ya no sé!
No te pude dejar ningún recado...
Qué pesada de mujer!
Pero te quiero decir una cosa...
Porque no entiendo...
Si tu tuvieras un problema...
.Esto te va apesaren la conciencia, te lo aseguro!
- Ah, eres tu.
- Te he dejado mil recados.
Si, ya lo he oído.
Qué pesada estas!
A mi no me digas eso porque me voy ahora mismo!
Entra.
He estado fuera toda la noche.
Yo también.
Entonces nos vendrá bien un café.
- ¿Te vas?
- Es de Iván. Me deja.
A mi también.
- ¿Has estado trabajando afuera?
- No te lo podía contar por teléfono.
El teléfono!
Acabo de romperlo!
Dios mio!
Tengo que llamar a Reparaciones!
Pero, Pepa, ¿me puedo quedar aquí?
Estoy metida en un lío muy grande, Pepa!
Ahora me lo cuentas, empieza a preparar el café. Qué pesada estas hoy, ¿no?
¿Si?
No me digas pesada!
Estoy muy sensible.
Por Dios.
Esto parece cosa de terrorismo.
Ah, el teléfono...
Pero si esto no es normal.
La policía! Estoy perdida.
Buenos días.
Abra. Sabemos que esta ahí.
- ¿Qué querían?
- Veníamos a ver el piso.
- ¿Para qué?
- Para alquilarlo. ¿Para qué va a ser?
Nos mandan de la agencia "Urbis".
En ese caso...
Pasen. Yo no vivo aquí.
La dueña bajo hace un momento.
- Carlos.
- ¿Si, mi amor?
Esto no me gusta.
Esta muy alto.
¿Qué esperabas, cariño?
Es un apartamento de azotea.
- Debe costar un ojo de la cara.
- Carísimo. Carísimo.
Es un sitio maravilloso.
Yo lo que quiero es una casa y esto no es una casa casa.
La muchacha tiene razón.
No me dé la razón y deje de llamarme "muchacha".
Carlos.
¿Si, cariño?
¿Y esto qué?
¿También te parece maravilloso?
Carajo.
Ay, la Pepa, como es.
Vámonos, por favor.
Vámonos.
Deje eso!
¿Usted qué es? Policía, ¿verdad?
¿Mi Carlos policía?
Qué disparate!
No, no soy policía.
¿Pero éste no es tu padre?
Ud. sera muy educada, pero las cosas que no son de una, no se tocan.
Cállese!
¿Qué hace aquí?
Pues no lo sé.
- Y a ella, ¿la conoces?
- Es Pepa. ¿Quién va a ser?
¿Conoces a Pepa?
No, personalmente, no.
No la conozco.
Pues aquí estoy.
¿Sabes quién soy?
Pepa, ¿te has dado cuenta de la cama?
Creo que si.
¿Y Ud. sabe quién soy yo?
Lo supe ayer. Aunque pueda ser tu madrastra, no me trates de usted.
¿Te ha mandado Iván por la maleta?
- No, estamos buscando apartamento.
- Vaya, qué casualidad.
Pues me alegro de conocerte, aunque sea en estas circunstancias.
- Esta es Marisa.
- ¿Quién?
Ah, encantada.
Soy su novia, vamos a casarnos.
Cuanto me alegro. Yo soy Pepa, la ex-amante del padre de Carlos.
Nosotras tenemos que hablar, Pepa.
Esta es Candela, una amiga.
¿Qué tal? Mucho gusto.
Encantada.
Carlos, por favor.
Me tienen que perdonar el desorden.
Pero llevo unos días...
Oye, ¿tu sabes arreglar un teléfono?
P... puedo intentarlo.
Ven. Acompáñame.
Es que éste no funciona... y estoy esperando una llamada de tu padre.
Candela, sírveles una taza de café.
No, gracias.
Tenemos prisa.
Eso. Que se vayan.
Que se vayan ya.
Candela, no seas grosera.
Están en mi casa.
Pepa, nosotras tenemos que hablar.
Espera, hija, no creo que sea tan urgente!
- ¿Tienes herramientas?
- Si, en la cocina.
Ahora te las traigo.
¿Tu crees que es momento de reparaciones ahora?
¿Y a ésa, no la reconoces?
Pues yo si. Esa es la descarada de la cabina de anoche.
¿Si? No me había dado cuenta.
Pepa, si no quieres que me quede, dímelo claramente.
¿Pero quién dijo que no quiero que te quedes?
Acabo de descubrir que el hombre con el que he vivido, tiene un hijo.
Y lo tengo delante de mi.
Es normal que le dé prioridad a él, ¿no?
Pero es que yo tengo un problema muy grande.
Bueno, pues ahora lo hablamos.
Pues cuando decidas que nos vamos, mantenme informada, por favor.
Si es un momento.
Aquí están.
¿Donde esta Iván?
Pues, no lo sé.
¿Por qué no me llama?
Tengo que hablar con él.
Yo lo veo muy poco, ¿sabes?
No me mientas tu también.
Se va con tu madre de viaje.
¿Con mi madre? Qué va!
Pero si ella piensa que se va contigo.
Entonces se va con otra.
Claro. Así se explica que no haya pasado la noche en el estudio.
¿Y como estas tan segura?
Porque estuve toda la noche de tu casa al estudio y del estudio a tu casa.
Pensaras que estoy loca.
Un poco nerviosa.
Pero es normal si no has dormido.
¿Iván no te dijo nunca que tenia un hijo?
Nunca. Yo no tenia ni idea.
Con tu padre, es imposible saber nada.
Siempre me entero de todo por casualidad.
Como anoche, estaba en la cabina. Cayó la maleta, se abrió, salio tu retrato...
Con una dedicatoria:
"De tu padre Iván que no te merece".
Y así me enteré.
El nunca dice nada, nunca reconoce nada... nunca sale un reproche de su boca!
¿Qué crees, que yo no sabia que tenia un amorío hace un ano?
Claro que lo sabia, pero tragaba.
Intenté hablar con él civilizadamente, pues nada.
Entonces le dije que en lo esencial no me engañara... que si algún día dejaba de quererme, que me lo dijera.
Y hace una semana conseguí que me lo dijera. Que no me quería.
No sabes el trabajo que me costo.
Gracias por dejar que me desahogue contigo, ya que no pude con tu padre.
No sabes lo que es esperar durante horas una llamada... te entran ganas de estrangularte con el cable.
- Por eso tiré el teléfono.
- Hiciste bien.
Oye, creo que tu amiga se va a tirar!
Que se tira!
Que se ha tirado!
Socorro!
Carlos, ten cuidado! Carlos!
No me suelten! Pepa!
Ay, Dios mio! Me muero!
Vamos! Tira!
¿Te das cuenta que podías matarte?!
Eso es lo que quería hacer!
Es que estaba muy desesperada.
Si tu estas desesperada, yo también!
Y no me da por tirarme por la terraza!
Uds., los jóvenes, no saben luchar por las cosas.
Se creen que la vida es todo placer.
Pues, no.
Hay que sufrir.
Y mucho.
Pepa, por favor.
No creo que sea el momento.
Si, es verdad.
Perdóname, Candela.
Es que me has dado un susto.
- Iván...
- ¿Si?
Digo, Carlos. Por favor, me puedes traer unos calmantes de la cocina.
Pepa, es que estoy metida en un lío muy grave.
Ya me lo imagino.
Carlos, ¿me quieres?
No es el momento para hablar de eso.
Cuéntame qué te pasa.
Hace tres meses, conocí a un hombre.
Pasamos juntos el fin de semana.
Cuando se fue, yo no sabia ni su nombre ni nada.
Pero me quedé prendida de él.
No podía pensar en otra cosa.
¿Qué paso el fin de semana?
Nada en particular. Nos revolcamos todo el tiempo sin parar, eso si.
Fue... Mira como se me pone, la carne de gallina.
Mira, fue como una revelación.
Como si hiciera el amor por primera vez.
Me gusto tanto.
A tu edad, el sexo tira mucho, desgraciadamente.
Porque si es terrorista, vivía en continuo peligro... y se te entrega mas que un hombre cualquiera.
Estaba segura de que volvería y que yo haría lo que él me pidiera.
¿Y volvió?
Hace dos semanas... con dos tíos mas.
- Y les abriste a los tres, claro.
- ¿Qué iba a hacer? Venían con él.
- Eso es un poco de abuso, ¿no?
- Espera, espera.
Una vez instalados, como yo notaba algo raro... me confiesa que son terroristas Chiita.
Me dio un ataque.
Dios mio, como me puse!
Suponía que podía ser peligroso, pero en ese momento no lo pensé.
Hasta que a los dos días, descubro que tenían armas... y que preparaban algo.
Bueno, yo le dije:
"Esto me lo deberías haber consultado a mi". ¿O no?
Y ahí me di cuenta de que todo era mentira.
Que él no me quería.
Que simplemente me había usado.
Gazpacho.
¿No se te ocurrió llamar a la policía?
Qué rico.
Estaba secuestrada en mi propia casa.
Tenia que esperar que se fueran.
- ¿Son los que arrestaron ayer?
- Si.
- ¿Los que salieron por la televisión?
- Los mismos.
Yo he tirado todas sus cosas, he limpiado las huellas... pero si han cantado en donde vivieron...
Porque claro, en el interrogatorio les habrán pegado.
A lo mejor no han dicho nada.
Los terroristas son muy duros.
Ya, pero si lo han dicho. A mi me estarán buscando de colaboradora... y a ti también, por no denunciarlo.
Por mi no te preocupes. Yo, en mi casa, colaboro con quien me da la gana.
Pepa, no sabia adonde ir.
No podía ir a Málaga con este asunto.
Bastante que soy modelo.
Hay que buscarte un abogado antes de que te arreste la policía.
De eso me encargo yo.
Tu no puedes moverte de aquí.
- Podrías hablar con Paulina Morales.
- ¿La feminista?
¿Una feminista?
Mejor que sea una mujer, así se lo tomara como algo personal.
Voy a cambiarme.
Luego me das la dirección.
¿Por qué Uds. los hombres son así?
No lo puedo entender, de verdad.
Ya no tengo paciencia para ningún hombre ni para ninguna persona.
Dios, lo que me faltaba!
Ayúdame!
- ¿Qué paso?
- Nada. Solo esta dormida.
¿Pero así de pronto?
Si, de pronto. Las cosas mas raras pasan así. De pronto.
Deberías saberlo por experiencia, Candela.
Eso es verdad.
Pero si hace un momento que...
Hace un momento ella quería irse a la calle... pero como tu no le hacías caso, se fue a la cocina... deprimida y se tomo un gazpacho.
¿Y por eso se quedo dormida?
Si. El gazpacho estaba dopado con somníferos.
Lo siento.
Si tu quieres, llamamos un médico.
- ¿Qué tipo de somníferos le echaste?
- "Morfidal".
- ¿Cuantos?
- Veinticinco o treinta.
Por lo menos va a descansar.
¿Como se te ocurrió hacer eso?
¿Tu también quieres matarte?
Lo hice para tu padre.
Le encanta el gazpacho.
Ya sé que no es una explicación... pero llevo horas esperándolo. Llega un momento en que una pierde los estribos.
Lo mismo que me paso a mi.
Eso le pasa a cualquiera.
No sean mal pensados.
No quería matarlo. Solo pretendía obligarlo a que se quedara.
Después pensé tirarlo, pero con su visita se me olvido.
Yo te entiendo perfectamente.
Gracias.
¿Cual era la dirección de la abogada?
Castellana 31.
¿Te importa quedarte hasta que yo vuelva?
Somos demasiadas mujeres para un apartamento tan grande.
- Me quedaré lo que haga falta.
- Gracias.¿Y me arreglas el teléfono?
- Tu estas mejor, ¿verdad?
- Un poco aturdida, pero...
No dejes que se asome a la terraza.
Adiós.
No, Pepa, si yo ya no...
Hola, Ana.
Mire lo que me encontré en la calle.
Cayó del cielo.
Es mio. Gracias.
Me extraño. Uno solo.
Y tenga mas cuidado!
Estaba Ana casualmente riñendo con su novio... y casi le da en la cabeza.
Así que mas cuidado.
- Usted otra vez!
- Espero que no le moleste.
Castellana 31.
Me alegro mucho de verla.
A mi novia le gusto mucho su autógrafo.
En cuanto le diga que la he vuelto a llevar, va a pensar que estamos...
¿Tendrá colirio por casualidad?
No. Lo siento.
Si quiere, pasamos por una farmacia.
No, no hace falta.
¿En qué estaría pensando?
¿Como no se me habrá ocurrido antes?
Qué cabeza la mía!
Ya esta.
Deja de pensar en ellos.
Los Chiitas pensaban secuestrar el vuelo de las 1 0:00 que va a Estocolmo... y desviarlo a Beirut porque allí tienen un amigo preso.
Pero ese vuelo lo va a tomar mucha gente. Hay que avisar a la policía.
¿A la policía, para qué?
¿Para que me arresten?
No localizaran la llamada.
Les daré la información muy rápido.
Si. Como tienes tanta facilidad de palabra.
Policía. Dígame.
El vuelo que sale esta noche a las 1 0:00... para Estocolmo... lo van a tratar de secuestrar unos terroristas Chiitas. Gracias.
Ya estamos.
No le diga a su novia que me ha visto llorar.
No se preocupe.
Esto queda entre nosotros.
Mejor.
- ¿Aquí?
- Allí abajo, donde dice "firme".
¿Puedo ver a Paulina Morales?
Esta ocupadísima esta tarde.
Imposible.
Es muy urgente.
Con 1 0 minutos me bastara.
Dile algo.
Seguro que la recibe.
- Venga conmigo.
- Gracias.
Adiós.
Espera aquí un momento.
Si, voy.
¿Puedo llamar?
Bueno.
Puedo hablar con Paulina?
¿Iván?
Me estoy volviendo loca.
"Estocolmo".
Puedes pasar.
- Pero como se atreve!
- Me dijeron que podía entrar.
Lo siento, pero tengo prisa.
No se preocupe.
La entretendré solo unos minutos.
¿Puedo sentarme?
Si, como no.
¿De qué se trata?
Pues, una amiga mía esta en apuros.
Una "amiga".
Se enamoro de un terrorista Chiita y se involucro con él.
¿Puedo fumar?
Es que tengo unas ganas.
El zapato es de ella.
El caso es que él volvió hace una semana con dos Chiitas mas.
Ya van tres Chiitas.
Y se le quedaron en su casa.
Luego la policía los detuvo... y ella esta cagada, pensando que la pueden buscar por cómplice.
En resumen, necesita una abogada.
¿Ah, si?¿Y por qué pensó en mi?
- Como Ud. es feminista.
- Bueno, ¿y qué?
Pues que éste es un caso tan claro de machismo, pensé que...
Yo me voy de viaje.
Le pasará el caso a una compañera.
De todas formas, no creo que haya mucho que hacer.
Su amiga tendrá que entregarse, ir a prisión... y cuando salga el juicio, que los jueces decidan.
- No la entiendo.
- Su compañera ha cometido un delito.
Su único delito ha sido enamorarse como una idiota y haber tenido miedo.
Yo, en su lugar, habría hecho lo mismo.
Estoy segura.
Bueno. No puedo creer esto!
Mire, vamos a hablar claro. ¿Por quién ha estado llorando?? Por su amiga?
No, no ha sido por ella.
¿Lo ve?
¿No sera a Ud. a quien han engañado?
Pues si.
A mi también me han engañado.
¿Un terrorista?
Se le puede llamar así.
Pero no es Chiita.
Es de aquí, de Madrid.
Pues se ha equivocado de sitio.
Esto no es un consultorio sentimental.
Y Ud. tampoco es una abogada,
Ud. es una hija de perra!
Váyase o llamo a la policía!
¿Solucionaste tu problema?
Si. Me voy mucho mas tranquila.
Me alegro.
¿Qué hace aquí esta maleta?
La bajo un chico y me dijo que el Sr. Iván vendría a recogerla.
Si el Sr. Iván quiere su maleta, que suba arriba por ella! Y que dé la cara!
Muy bien, yo se lo diré.
¿Necesita ayuda?
No, no necesito ayuda!
Pepa, estoy a quien Madrid contigo y no necesito mas.
Iván, yo también estoy en Madrid contigo y soy muy feliz al verte escribir esto.
Llamo, ¿verdad?
Si. Yo atendí el teléfono.
¿Y? Dame eso!
- Perdona por leer las postales.
- Da igual. ¿Qué te dijo?
Pensaba venir aquí, pero al descubrir que tu sabias quién soy yo... le da vergüenza verte.
Qué delicadeza!
Yo tampoco quiero volver a verlo!
Pero te juro que si quiere recuperar esta maldita maleta... tendré que subir por ella!
- ¿Y las chicas?
- Sin novedad.
¿Y Candela?
En tu habitación.
¿Te pasa algo?
No, no. ¿Viste a la abogada?
Si. Luego te lo cuento.
¿Te importa que haya tomado un vestido tuyo?
Puedes quedártelo.
Te sienta mejor que a mi.
Procura no perderlo de nuevo.
No tengo zapatos de tu numero.
- ¿Viste a la abogada?
- Si.
Prepárate, nos vamos de viaje.
¿Huyendo de la justicia como dos fugitivas?
No exageres, hasta que pase este lío, es mejor que nos vayamos de vacaciones.
Yo también las necesito.
Yo sabia que me metían presa... y a ti también, por encubridora.
Candela, por favor, que no pasa nada.
Dentro de una semana, volvemos.
Te presentas a un juez con tu abogada y le cuentas todo... menos lo de la revolcada y asunto liquidado.
¿De verdad? Pepa, no me mientas.
Tu sabes que soy muy ingenua.
La abogada dijo que no hay razón para preocuparse... que, cuando nos vayamos, estemos en contacto con ella.
Cuantas preocupaciones te estoy dando... como si tu no tuvieras bastante ya.
Vamos a regar un poco y a darle una vuelta a los animales.
Luego preparamos el equipaje.
"Dr. José María Pardo.
Resultado de las pruebas realizadas a la paciente, doña Pepa Marcos'.
.Cielos!
- Oye, ¿y con éstos qué hacemos?
- No lo sé.
Pues yo de tu hijastro no me fiaría, se ha pasado todo el día espiando.
Es natural, pero ya poco va a encontrar.
Deja, lo hago yo, tu descansa.
¿Por qué?
- ¿Estas bien?
- Yo si.
Vayan a arreglar el Corralito mientras yo riego.
Pobrecitas.
Como me van a echar de menos.
Están tristes, ¿verdad?
No me extraña. Como yo.
Ahora, cuando me vaya de aquí, las llevo conmigo.
No las voy a dejar aquí solas.
Como soy yo, no las voy a dejar aquí abandonadas.
Esa no se despierta.
A ver.
Nada. Bueno, es igual.
Peor para ella.
Ay, los conejos como están!
Mira. Sequito.
Pepa los tiene, claro. Demasiado.
Echa agua.
¿Tu nunca has tenido conejos?
Yo si, en mi casa, muchos.
Yo sé mucho de conejos.
Oye, Carlos... Ay, mi niño, mira los nabos, ¿eh? Como le gustan.
Carlos, yo... Vamos, que me perdones por lo del tartamudeo.
- A veces, soy una bruta.
- No tiene importancia.
De todas formas, tu te pasaste un poquito.
Tu comportamiento no estuvo bien.
Lo sé porque muchos hombres se han aprovechado de mi siempre.
Yo me he dado cuenta, pero tarde.
Si me hubiera dado cuenta antes, ¿no?
Sin ir mas lejos, fíjate, el mundo
árabe. Como se ha portado conmigo.
Y yo eso no me lo merezco.
Soy Lucia.
Necesito verla.
No puedo.
Salgo ahora de viaje.
Tenemos que hablar antes de que se vaya.
Hay cosas que nos interesan a las dos.
Si se refiere a Iván, esa cosa ya no me interesa.
Entonces, ¿por qué se va con él?
Señora, esta Ud. en las nubes.
Entre Iván y yo, ya no hay nada, excepto dolor.
De todas maneras voy a verla.
Sé donde vive. Lo sé desde hace tiempo.
Ni se le ocurra. Llevo dos días recibiendo negativas de todo el mundo.
Ahora soy yo la que dice "no".
Tengo que ver a Iván antes de que se vaya.
Búsquele en otra parte y a mi, déjeme en paz!
- ¿Era mama?
- Si.
Por favor, no seas tan dura con ella.
Es que no sabes como me habla.
Es que esta muy enferma de la cabeza.
Pues amenaza con venir.
¿Qué le vas a decir?
- Sera mejor que no te vea.
- ¿Y yo qué hago?
Calienta el café, a ver si espabilamos a Marisa. Tu ven, tenemos que hablar.
Lo de Paulina Morales, fatal.
Acabamos pegándonos.
¿Entonces no va a defender a Candela?
¿Esa? Esa es capaz de denunciarla.
¿Tu de donde la conoces?
Fue la abogada de mama.
Entonces no me extraña que tu madre está mal de la cabeza.
Iván y mama rompieron antes de que yo naciera.
Después del parto, mama enloqueció y la internaron.
Yo me he criado con mis abuelos.
A Iván no le permitieron ni que me conociera.
Ya puedes mirar.
Hace un ano, a mama le dieron el alta.
Cuando salio del hospital, volvió a ver a Iván, como si no hubiera pasado nada.
Pero él estaba contigo.
¿Me subes el cierre?
Entonces lo demando por todos los anos que había estado internada... y le pidió un montón de millones por daños y perjuicios.
Y puso el caso en manos de Paulina.
Tu madre no se anda con rodeos.
Paulina intento demandar a Iván, pero no resulto.
Qué historia tan absurda.
Mama me odia.
Represento para ella todo el tiempo que ha estado en el hospital sin Iván.
Pues, yo te quiero.
Porque representas lo único bueno que ha hecho Iván en la vida.
- Ah, estabas ahí.
- Es que no me atreví a interrumpir.
- ¿Adonde vas tan elegante?
- Salgo, pero vuelvo enseguida.
No le digas nada de lo de Paulina.
- ¿Pero qué?
- Nada. A ver si Marisa se despierta.
- ¿Y si no se despierta, qué?
- Me da igual. Yo lo digo por tu madre.
- Además, nosotras nos vamos de viaje.
- ¿Como?
- Nos vamos.
- ¿Adonde?
- Es mejor que no lo sepas.
- Somos dos fugitivas.
No hables así.
Pero cuanto menos sepas, mejor.
- Si lo sabe todo.
- Anda.
Y si llama Iván, ¿qué le digo?
Dile que no espero nada de él.
Que lo único que me queda suyo, es esta maleta... y voy a deshacerme de ella ahora mismo.
No. Mejor no le digas nada.
No contesten el teléfono... y no abran la puerta.
De acuerdo.
Vuelvo enseguida.
Carlos, mira, he oído antes lo de tu madre y me ha dado mucha lastima.
Qué manía tienes de besar a todo el mundo!
Vamos a darle el café a la otra.
¿Qué le pasara?
Nada. Se esta divirtiendo.
Es que no la había visto nunca así.
Mejor no la despertamos.
Lo esta pasando muy bien.
¿No ves la cara que tiene?
Se lo esta pasando de maravilla.
Ay, la cara!
Mira el labio!
Hola. Vengo por la maleta. La Srta. Pepa me dijo que la dejaría aquí.
Me extraña mucho. La bajo un chico mientras la Srta. Pepa no estaba... y cuando volvió y la vio aquí, no sabe como se puso.
- ¿Y qué hizo con la maleta?
- La volvió a subir y me dijo:
"Si quiere la maleta, que suba a recogerla.
Y que dé la cara!"
- ¿Así?
- Como lo oye.
Ahora esta arriba.
Ahora no puedo subir.
Me esperan en el auto.
Hace rato que subió, seguro que ya esta mas tranquila.
Claro que no se lo puedo asegurar.
Volveré mañana.
Y no le diga que estuve aquí.
Lo siento, pero yo soy testigo de Jehová y mi religión me prohíbe mentir.
Yo solo puedo decir la verdad, toda la verdad y nada mas que la verdad.
Si no le pregunta, no diga nada.
Pero si me pregunta, tendré que contarle todo con pelos y señales.
Adiós.
Ya me gustaría a mi mentir.
Pero eso es lo malo de los testigos... que no podemos.
Si no, aquí iba a estar yo.
Me va el sonido de las trompetas del Juicio Final
Iván, tengo que hablar urgentemente contigo.
Déjame dicho en el contestador donde y cuando. Adiós.
Pepa, no puedo recoger la maleta.
Me hubiera gustado hablar contigo... pero ya veo que no quieres.
Dentro de unos días, volveré a intentarlo... cuando estás mas tranquila.
Quiero que sepas que los anos que hemos estado juntos... han sido los mejores anos de mi vida.
No me voy de viaje ni con ninguna mujer.
Adiós, mi amor.
Te deseo lo mejor, de Corazón.
Soy infeliz
Porque sé que no me quieres
Para qué más insistir
Vive feliz, mi bien
Si el amor que tu me diste para siempre he de sentir
Soy infeliz
Se quedo ahí, en la cabina!
Esta loco!
Esta no sabe quién soy yo!
Mira, te voy a meter un puro por lo de los tres Chiitas que te vas a cagar!
No me voy de viaje ni con ninguna mujer.
Adiós, mi amor.
Te deseo lo mejor...
Mentiroso!
A lo mejor es verdad.
Me puede engañar con todo, menos con la voz.
Conozco todos sus tonos de memoria.
Llevo anos trabajando con él!
Maldito aparato!
No lo soporto!
¿Qué hacías agachado en la cabina?
Me cago en la puta madre de esta señora!
¿Como te pudiste fijar en ella?!
Vamos a recoger tu equipaje.
- Lo rompiste otra vez.
- No hace falta que lo arregles.
Te tienes que tranquilizar.
Ya has visto como tienes los cristales.
- La policía!
- Tranquilízate, Candela. Ven para acá.
Es Iván.
Ya sabia yo que no era un cobarde.
Es tu madre.
¿Te habías olvidado ya de ella?
- Vamos a jugar a esto.
- Ay, no sé!
- ¿Abro?
- Si.
- Pues lee las instrucciones!
- "Estratego es..."
No, en voz baja!
¿Pero qué haces tu aquí? Traidor!
- Pues...
- ¿Quiénes son, Carlos?
No lo sé.
- Policías.
- Son policías.
¿Y qué quieren?
No hace falta que nos traduzcas.
Ya le hemos entendido.
- Vamos.
- Si.
Te callas o te doy una bofetada.
Buenas.
¿Viene con Uds.?
No, la encontramos en el ascensor.
- ¿Qué pasa?
- Nada.
- Comentábamos el modelo de la señora.
- Es horroroso.
- Solo es un traje.
- Pero es horroroso.
Ella es libre de ponerse el traje que quiera.
Deja de comportarte como una niña frente a los señores policías!
"Te quiero, te necesito, te deseo".
"Tu Iván".
¿Puedo saber la razón de su visita?
Desde su teléfono, hemos recibido una llamada... en relación con unos terroristas.
Perdón. ¿Decía?
Desde su teléfono hubo una llamada en relación con unos terroristas Chiitas.
¿Lo ves? Te lo dije.
Estos chicos.
Me temo que hay una confusión. Mi teléfono no funciona desde esta mañana.
Lo acaba de arrancar!
Yo hablé con ella hace 20 minutos.
No le haga caso.
La pobre no sabe lo que dice.
- Por curiosidad, ¿de qué se me acusa?
- De nada.
Solo queremos saber quién llamo y como consiguió la información.
¿Y quién ha arrancado el teléfono?
El teléfono lo arranqué yo.
Esta mañana.
Por lo tanto, nadie los ha llamado esta tarde desde aquí.
Qué pico tiene Pepa!
¿Por qué lo arranco?
Estaba esperando una llamada. Y como no me llamaban, me puse un poco nerviosa.
¿Quién esperabas que llamara?
¿Iván? ¿Donde esta?
Señora, cállese. Aquí el que interroga soy yo. Bueno... nosotros.
No, esta bien, sigue.
Pregúntale quién es ese Iván.
- ¿Quién es ese Iván?
- El causante de todo este caos... y del caos que va a descubrir su compañero en breves instantes.
Va a descubrir a Marisa.
Explíquese.
¿Le importa que me siente?
Si tengo que abrirle mi Corazón, prefiero estar cómoda.
Hoy he tenido un día muy movido.
Muy bien.
¿Esta cómoda?
Estaría mas cómoda sola, con mis amigos... jugando al Estratego.
Hay momentos en que no se puede tener todo, señora.
En eso estoy de acuerdo.
Bueno, ¿quiere decirme quién es ese Iván?
Fue mi pareja hasta hace una semana.
Antes estuvo involucrado con esa señora.
Es el padre de mi hijo.
¿Este?
¿Y qué hace aquí?
Puse el apartamento en alquiler y él vino a alquilarlo.
No lo sabia.
Tengo la impresión de que me están tomando el pelo.
¿Ud. cree que me divierte contarle mi intimidad al primero que viene aquí?
Pues, se equivoca.
Esta situación es humillante.
Mama, me das mal nombre!
- Candela, tráeme algo de beber.
- ¿Qué quieres?
- Queda gazpacho.
- Ah, si. Gazpacho.
Vamos, Candela.
- ¿Adonde van?
- Por gazpacho. ¿Le apetece un tazón?
Estamos de servicio, pero por no desairarla...
Gazpacho para todos!
¿La chica de la terraza no esta dormida?
Como un tronco.
Es Marisa, la novia de Carlos.
Estaba cansada y se acostó un rato.
¿Quiere que la despierte?
No, todavía no.
¿Por qué no se sienta aquí?
Es que me va a dar tortícolis.
Señora, no tenemos nada contra Ud.
Muchas gracias.
No quisiera resultar inquisitivo... pero no me negara que aquí ha ocurrido algo raro.
Su habitación quemada... el teléfono y la ventana rotos...
Claro que ha ocurrido algo raro.
A mi también me gustaría entenderlo.
Bien. Empecemos por el principio.
Y sea clara y concisa, por favor.
No sé si podré.
Estoy demasiado dolorida para ser clara, concisa y justa.
Palabras.
- Cuénteme solo los hechos.
- Bien.
Vivía aquí... con Iván.
Nos queríamos.
Al menos, yo.
Después de meses en los que yo hice todo por defender nuestro amor... rompimos hace una semana.
Ayer me llamo para que le preparara una maleta con lo que queda de él... porque se va de viaje con otra.
- ¿Como lo sabes?? Te lo dijo él?
- Iván no sabe viajar solo.
Recuerda, estos dos son para la policía.
Yo voy a recargar el jugo.
Tampoco te pases.
Esto esta caliente.
Ay, Carlos, por Dios!
Con el cuadro que hay enfrente.
La policía, tu madre, tu novia!
¿No te da miedo?
Siga, por favor.
Empaqueté todo y me fui a trabajar.
Y cuando volví, me encontré la casa como la ven ahora.
Menos lo del teléfono que reconozco que fui yo.
La maleta y unas bolsas habían desaparecido... y la cama estaba quemada.
Sus amigos no tardan demasiado.
Ve tu.
Estarán besuqueándose.
Se gustan, ¿sabe?
- ¿Y Marisa?
- Tendrá que espabilarse.
Es el hijo de su padre.
- ¿Quién sera a estas horas?
- ¿Qué quieres?
- Soy empleado de reparaciones.¿Y tu?
- Policía.
- A ver, identifícate.
- Tu también.
¿Es usted la que llamo esta mañana?
Pues, si. Este es el teléfono y ahí esta la conexión. Acompañame.
Insisto en que yo hablé con este teléfono hace 20 minutos.
Y dale, qué obsesión!
Con este teléfono, lo dudo, señora.
Bueno, vayamos al grano.
¿Conoce a unos terroristas Chiitas?
- ¿Los que han salido en el noticiero?
- Cállese! Le pregunta a la señorita.
No sabia que había terroristas Chiitas en Madrid.
¿Ustedes los conocen?
Yo no. Yo de política, no entiendo.
Si, hombre.
Han salido esta tarde en la tele.
- ¿Quieres callarte de una vez?
- Pepa, ¿prendo la tele?
No tengo el menor interés por esos Chiitas.
¿Ud. los conoce?
¿Por qué no nos dejan? Pepa y yo tenemos cosas mas importantes de que hablar.
De hombres, ¿no?
¿Hay algo que importe mas?
Muy bien. Hablemos de hombres.
¿Cree que Iván tiene alguna relación con los terroristas?
- Tranquila.
- ¿Iván?
No lo sé.
Me ha ocultado tantas cosas.
¿Le importa darme su dirección... o su teléfono?
Teléfono, no tiene.
Y en su apartamento no esta.
Ya le he dicho que se va de viaje.
Ahora debe estar en el aeropuerto.
¿En el aeropuerto?
¿Adonde se va?
¿Adonde se va?
A Estocolmo... esta noche.
Con Paulina Morales.
¿A Estocolmo?!
¿Pero por qué no lo dijiste antes?
Es que acabo de descubrirlo.
Atando cabos.
Claro. Ahora lo entiendo todo.
La llamada.
Qué tonta he sido, Carlos!
¿Como no me había dado cuenta?
Una jugada perfecta la de su abogada, señora.
¿Y no sabia que los Chiitas pensaban secuestrar ese vuelo?
¿Los Chiitas?
Pero si lo sabe toda España!
Lo acaban de decir por la televisión.
Pero antes de eso alguno de Uds. lo sabia.
Y quiero que me lo diga de una jodida vez... o los arresto a todos y me dejo de contemplaciones!
¿Entonces qué hacen aquí y no están en el aeropuerto?
En el aeropuerto, hay mas policías que pasajeros. No se preocupe por eso.
No sé qué me pasa... pero como que no confiese, me los llevo.
Jefe, a este gazpacho le han echado algo.
¿Qué tiene este gazpacho?
Tomate, pepino... pimiento, cebolla... un diente de ajo... aceite, sal, vinagre... pan duro y agua.
El secreto esta en mezclar lo bien.
A Iván le encanta como lo mezclo yo.
Lo hice para él.
¿Coleccionas armas?
No te acerques!
Ve para allá.
No quisiera herir a los chicos.
¿Es cierto que Iván se va ahora a Estocolmo?
Es una intuición, pero estoy casi segura.
¿De qué asunto tan importante tienes que hablar con él?
Ya de ninguno.
Lo único que quiero es olvidarlo.
Y tu, deberías hacer lo mismo.
En el hospital, no me acordaba de él.
Claro que no me acordaba de nada.
Hasta que de pronto... una noche, frente al televisor, lo oí.
No reconocí su cara... pero reconocí su voz.
Le decía a una mujer que la quería.
Sentí por dentro como una convulsión.
Recordé todas las veces que me lo había dicho.
Recobré la razón y la memoria.
Desde ese momento... empecé a comportarme como si estuviera curada... y me dejaron salir.
Si estas curada, deja de apuntarme.
Es que no estoy curada.
Pero lo fingí y me creyeron.
Solo matándolo, conseguiré olvidarlo.
¿Y como piensas hacerlo?
Iré al aeropuerto.
El aeropuerto esta tomado por la policía. Ya los oíste.
No importa, me las arreglaré.
Y ahora que lo sabes todo...
Bebamos.
Bebe!
Tu también.
Ay, mis ojos!
Ay, mis ojos!
Dejo la puerta abierta!
Esa puerta!
Por favor, lléveme al aeropuerto.
No puedo.
Espero a alguien.
He dicho que me lleve!
- Pero, señora, ¿qué hace?
- Le apunto con una pistola. Vamos.
Mi novia se va a enojar.
Como que no arranques pronto, la enojada voy a ser yo. Rápido! A Estocolmo!
Pero como se atreve!
Delante de mis narices!
Pepa, ¿viste eso?
Ven al taxi.
A ver si los alcanzamos. Vamos!
Usted otra vez!
Uy, qué suerte!
Estamos hechos el uno para el otro!
¿A quién tenemos que seguir ahora?
- Aquella moto!
- La Harley esa!
A ver si los alcanzo.
- Van al aeropuerto.
- ¿Y tu como lo sabes?
Soplame los ojos que me arden terriblemente.
La mujer que va con tu novio esta loca y lleva una pistola. Bueno, dos.
- ¿Por qué se llevo a mi Ambite?
- Porque tiene prisa por llegar.
Ay, el colirio!
¿Necesitan algo mas las señoras?
No. Es Ud. maravilloso. Debemos llegar antes que ellos. Esa mujer es peligrosa.
No hay mujer peligrosa si se la sabe tratar.
- Míralos. Allá están.
- Ya los tengo.
No veo nada.
Seguro que le dijo que la lleve y él no supo negarse.
Ana, esa mujer lleva dos pistolas y esta chiflada.
Mira como voy yo! Bañada de gazpacho, medio ciega y descalza!
¿Qué crees, que voy así para llamar la atención? No! Me lo hizo ella.
Esa mujer es capaz de todo!
En esa moto no se sube otro trasero mas que el mio.
Me tiene hasta los huevos.
Me voy a buscar un negocio, ganar buena plata... y comprarle la moto a él y después... puerta.
¿Para qué necesito yo un hombre teniendo la moto?
Es mucho mas fácil aprender mecánica que psicología masculina.
A una moto puedes llegar a conocerla a fondo... a un hombre, jamas.
Jamas.
Mira como se agarra, le esta apretando el paquete!
Eso no creo.
Se agarra para no caerse.
Acaba de salir del sanatorio... y parece que lleva en la moto montada toda la vida.
Papito, ten cuidado! Esta loca!
Y lleva una pistola!
Puta!
Bajate!
Cállense, idiotas!
Deja a mi hombre en paz!
¿No puedes ir mas rápido?
Señora, hago lo que puedo, esto es una reliquia.
¿Una reliquia?
Pues no te olvides de ésta!
Esta bien! No dispare!
¿Y tu no llevas pistolas en el supermercado?
Yo no las necesito.
Y si te asaltan, ¿como te defiendes?
Le rehuyo al peligro, como ahora.
Lo siento, señoras. Pero, a partir de ahora, se acabo la persecución.
Aunque no los persiga, vaya por otro lado, pero llévenos al aeropuerto.
Yo solo soy un simple taxista, no un cazador de recompensas.
Cuando yo me subí al auto, le advertí que era una mujer peligrosa.
Y él me dijo que sabia tratarlas.
Aquí mismo.
Gracias.
Por favor, ¿para Estocolmo?
Esto son nacionales.
Internacionales es al fondo.
- Eres un débil, Iván.
- Si, cariño.
- No me digas "si, cariño"!
- Pero tienes razón.
A veces me gustaría no tener razón.
Llévame a la clínica.
Es donde vivo.
¿Te encuentras bien?
Déjame.
Me has salvado la vida, cariño.
No tengas miedo.
No voy a pedirte nada a cambio.
Bueno, si.
Que se vaya.
Que se vaya!
Pepa, estoy avergonzado.
Me he portado muy mal contigo.
No sabes cuanto lo siento.
Lo único que quería era hablar contigo.
Llevo dos días y dos noches esperándote... buscándote por todo Madrid, dejándote recados por todas partes.
Esta noche podemos hablar.
Lo del viaje a Estocolmo puede esperar.
No. Ya es tarde.
No seas resentida.
Cambio los pasajes y tomamos algo en la cafetería.
Ayer... esta mañana, hoy al mediodía... todavía era posible.
Pero ahora ya es tarde.
Hace ya dos horas que es tarde.
¿Entonces por qué viniste aquí si no para hablar conmigo?
Me enteré de que
Lucia venia a matarte... y yo la seguí hasta aquí para impedírselo.
Como ya no corres peligro, me voy.
Adiós.
Qué gusto, por fin en casa!
Las visitas... están cómodas.
¿Y los chicos?
Qué capacidad de recuperación la de Candela!
Espero que tenga mas suerte que con los Chiitas.
Vaya, como esta todo!
Mañana lo primero la criada.
Me voy a poner los zapatos para no cortarme con los vidrios.
Claro que no sé lo que va a ser mejor... si resbalarme con el gazpacho, o cortarme con los vidrios.
El de reparaciones me encanta, pero casi mejor para Marisa, la pobre.
Debo haberme quedado dormida.
¿Como te sientes?
Como nueva.¿Y tu?
Tienes mal aspecto.
Es que... voy a tener un hijo.
No sabia.
Eres la primera persona a la que se lo digo.
Pues felicidades!
Siéntate aquí, estarás mucho mas cómoda.
Mañana te lo explico todo.
- Pero...
- Siéntate.
Tu acabas de despertarte, pero yo llevo dos noches sin dormir.
Creo que no lo voy a alquilar.
Me encantan las vistas.
Si, hay que reconocer que son preciosas.
¿Pero cuanto tiempo llevas sin dormir?
Un montón de horas!
Tienes un cutís fenomenal.
¿Sabes? Tuve un sueno.
- ¿Agradable?
- No sé, yo creo que si.
Cuando yo entré por esa puerta, era virgen... y tengo la impresión de que ya no lo soy.
- Uno de esos sinvergüenzas se...
- No. Ha sido en el sueno! Sonando.
Qué bien!
Ahora que me lo dices, tu sabes que se te ha quitado... de la cara la típica dureza de las vírgenes.
Las vírgenes son muy antipáticas.
