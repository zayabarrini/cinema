"Hi, I'm Zaya Barrini. 

I wanted to share something I've been learning recently that surprisingly reshaped how I think about engineering leadership: Mandarin Chinese.

Now, I hit a real wall with the traditional way of learning—you know, just repeating characters over and over or drilling flashcards.

It felt chaotic and my brain was struggling to find patterns.

So, I decided to build a system. 

I started color-coding the characters based on their grammatical classes. 

Suddenly, what was a wall of black-and-white symbols became a structured, visual map. 

I had created my own 'syntax' for understanding, and instantly, what felt overwhelming became manageable and even enjoyable.

And this is where it connects directly to my philosophy on engineering management. 

Our role as leaders is to be system architects for our teams. 

We are constantly faced with complex, ambiguous challenges—a sprawling product roadmap, a legacy system that needs untangling, or a new technical strategy.

Our job isn't to have all the answers, but to create the frameworks and clarity that allow our teams to navigate that complexity without being overwhelmed. 

We build the visualizations, establish the clear processes, and foster the communication rhythms that turn chaos into focused, effective work.

I even found myself applying this to my playlist of EXO's Chinese albums, color-coding songs by theme and energy. 

It turned a passive listening activity into an active, systematic learning tool. 

It proved to me that this principle of 'structured clarity' is universal.

So, the big lesson for me has been this: 

Whether you're learning a language, organizing a playlist, or leading an engineering team, the goal is the same. 

Great leadership is about designing systems and environments that make the complex feel simple. 

It’s about reducing cognitive load so that brilliant people can do their most creative and impactful work.

That’s the mindset—one of a systems thinker and a clarity-creator—that I am so excited to bring to the Engineering Manager role at Buffer."

# Annalise x Trucco

I have a record of an injunction brought against your project by Trisha Stanley, advocating for the thousands of citizens living in low-income housing who would be displaced by your project.

Ten days after, Miss Stanley was murdered.

Your attorney struck down the injunction, and your project went forward unopposed.

So my question is, Senator Trucco, did you have Trisha Stanley murdered?

Did you convince your tenant, Linda Morelli, to testify that Trisha Stanley was killed by her boyfriend, David Allen?

Explain why your eviction suit against Miss Morelli was dropped despite her inability to pay rent.

Is it because her lost rent money was nothing compared to the millions you made once Miss Stanley was out of your way?

Answer the question, Senator.

Why was Linda Morelli granted these concessions?

I am sorry, Senator, if you do not have the time to answer for who bore the real cost of your development.

Not just Trisha Stanley and her boyfriend, David Allen, who served 21 years in prison…

But the thousands who were displaced in the name of lining your pockets…

The majority of whom are poor, powerless, and didn’t bear the color of skin desirable to your business interests.

You tore a community apart. You tore families apart. You destroyed lives, Senator.

Admit it. Admit you killed Trisha Stanley and had my client, David Allen, set up for her murder.

I am sorry, senator, if you do not have the time to answer for who bought the real cost of your development.

Not just Trisha Stanley and her boyfriend, David Allen, who served 21 years in prison but the thousands who were displaced in the name of lining your pockets.

The majority of whom are poor, powerless and didn’t hear the color of skin desirable to your business interests.

You tore a community apart.

You tore families apart.

You destroyed lives, Senator.

Admit it.

Admit you killed Trisha Stanley and had my client, David Allen, set up for her murder.

# Asher vs Father

As a kid I used to look through all your journals. Years of meeting meticulously documented. It’s impressive. There’s only one day unaccounted for. One day in years. The day you met with the prosecutor on the David Allen’s case. Did the Ada on that case tell you that someone had committed perjury. One summer after that verdict you received your federal appointment. You were an underdog for the job. Mama’s always said you friend Arthur Truco put the good word for you. Is this woman, Keating, putting these crazy ideas in your head? Your whole life you have prided yourself on the fact that you don’t lie. And now I’m sitting here accusing you of grave judicial misconduct and your answer is where did i get the idea from? Tell me I’m wrong. Tell me you didn’t get to be where you are on the back of a man who’s gonna die.

Get out. After all I’ve done for you. You ungrateful little twat. Get the hell out of my house.

# Eve, Love, Annalise

I gave you the chance to explain it. You just lied to my face. I’m not doing this. I’m not letting you ruin me. And risk my entire career in the process? Did you really think I would do that? That I wouldn’t remember how familiar this all feels? You don’t get to do this anymore. You can’t use people and expect them to stick around. Maybe this is all who you’ve always been and I was just blind to it. All the ambition to just make up for the fact that you knew deep inside that there’s nothing good inside of you. Shame on me for expecting more.

# Frank

This Laurel. She’s always sticking her head where it don’t belong. Asking questions that don’t concern her. She lied to me about the trophy that night, stole prom queen’s ring and even suggested that I killed Rebecca.

# Father Flynn

What do you do when you're not sure?

That's the topic of my sermon today.

Last year when Predisent Kennedy was assassinated, who among us did not experience the most profound disorientation?

Despair?

Which way? What now?

What do I say to my kids?

What do I tell myself?

It was a time of people sitting together, bound together by a common feeling of hopelessness.

But think of that.

Your bond with your fellow being was your despair.

It was a public experience.

It was awful, but we were in it together.

How much worse is it then for the lone man, the lone woman, stricken by a private calamity?

"No one knows I'm sick." "No one knows I've lost my last real friend."

"No one knows I've done something wrong."

Imagine the isolation.

Now you see the world as through a window.

On one side of the glass, happy untroubled people, and on the other side, you.

There are those of you in church today who know exactly the crisis of faith I describe, and I wanna say to you: doubt can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty.

When you are lost, you are not alone.

# Colin Farrell - His Son

- Why don't we play a game?

- What game?

I'll tell you a secret, something I've never told you before.

Then you'll tell me one and whoever tells the best secret wins. Okay?

When I was your age,

I'd only just started masturbating.

And I'd only just started ejaculating.

Only a little, barely a drop. was worried that I had some kind of problem because at school I'd heard all sorts of stories.

Then one day, when my father had had a lot to drink, and my brothers were out and he was sleeping in the bedroom,

I crept inside, put my hand on his penis, and started stroking it until he ejaculated.

The sheets were covered in sperm.

I got scared and ran out.

I've never told anyone that before.

Now, it's your turn to tell me a secret.

I don't know. I don't have one.

That's impossible.

You have to have one.

No. I don't.

Bob, if all this is just an act, you should know that if you tell me now,

I won't punish you.

And neither will your mother.

We won't be angry with you, either.

It's not an act.

But if it is an act and you don't stop this stupid joke right now, your punishment won't just be no TV for two months.

I will take my electric razor, and I will shave your head and make you eat your hair.

I mean it, I will literally make you eat your hair. I'm not kidding

It's not an act.

# Ofelia, Annalise's Mother

No, no, mama. All right?

Let's not go around and around like this.

Let's just dive right in.

Did you know?

Uncle Clyde is dead.

Did you know what he did to me?!

He's dead!

Did you hear me?

And the Lord made sure he got what he deserved.

So you knew.

Ophelia: Anna Mae!

My sorry-ass husband might have been a cheater and lowlife, but he saw me, why I am this way.

That man understood nothing.

Sam knew exactly what happened to me the minute I stepped into his office... everything!

He said this thing that happened to me, what you ignore, is why I am the way I am.

Your aunt Lynn was got out by her first-grade school-teacher.

Reverend Daniels got me after choir practice.

The first man I worked for, some of the men I dated.

I told you... Men take things.

They've been taking things from women since the beginning of time.

Ain't no reason to talk about it and get all messy everywhere.

Certainly no reason to go to a headshrinker for help and end up marrying him.

You ain't learned nothing.

I bought that house over off peachtree when I was pregnant with you.

I was so proud of that house.

It wasn't much, but it was mine.

Built a porch swing and tended a little garden that was just right out front.

I baked up a storm on that old stove.

You know the ones that you had to light with a long match?

And one winter, Uncle Clyde came by and said he needed a place to stay, just till he got on his feet, he said.

Can't turn your back on your family.

And then, one day I woke up in the middle of the night.

I don't know what it was.

I-I-I just woke up.

I walked down the hall to look in on you, and Clyde, he came out of your room, and I knew what he had done.

He was a big man.

Loved his liquor and his hooch.

Smoked three packs of cigarettes a day, was always stinking up the house with cigarette smoke.

All the time, he would just fall asleep on the couch, a cigarette hanging out his mouth.

I'd go by and put it out.

Then one night, not too long after, he fell asleep on the couch drunk as a skunk, that cigarette hanging out of his mouth.

I got you and your brothers and sisters out of bed, and we went over to aunt mabel's to sleep.

And that night, that house that I loved so much burned to the ground, and your Uncle Clyde burned right with it.

Oh, I know how... how you've been torturing yourself about what went on here, baby.

And maybe you did something real bad...

I don't know and don't much care if you did.

I know if you did, you had your reason.

'Cause sometimes you got to do what you got to do...

Even if all you've got is a long match and a very flammable hooch.
