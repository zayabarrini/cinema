## All of us Strangers

Meanwhile, work goes on for the

Brits who've relocated to the Costa.

Running a bar in the sun is the classic British dream.

It can easily turn into a nightmare, but Gary and Cherry from Macclesfield have made it work. The Bamboo Bar is a success.

Hello.

Hello.

I saw you looking at me from the street.

I've seen you a bunch of times coming along with your head down.

One day it'll be for real, that alarm.

We're basically the only ones here. Can you fucking believe that? I mean, they haven't got security guards yet.

I'm Harry.

Adam.

Hey.

How do you cope?

- With... what? 

- Listen.

It's so quiet. I mean, London's out there,  but we can't hear a fucking thing.

I play music right, but it's worse when it ends. And I even got one of those, um... uh, w-white noise machines, right.

But it's like there's someone in the corner of the room whispering about me.

I mean, we can't even open the windows, but I guess they don't really want us to jump.

It's bad for business, you know.

Bodies broken on the concrete.

I mean, who's gonna move in then?

A drink?

It's Japanese.

It's meant to be the best in the world, but I couldn't tell you why, so...

No, thanks.

Yeah okay, um...

Okay, how about I come in anyway?

If not for a drink, then... for whatever else you might want.

I don't think that's a good idea.

Do I scare you?

No.

We don’t have to do anything if I’m not your type.

There’s vampires at my door.

Hi.

Hi.

I, uh, thought something strong for a night like this.

No, thanks.

Shall we go?

Go where?

Home.

She's gonna be over the moon to see you.

Guess who I found loitering in the park?

Is it him?

Oh, yeah, it's definitely him.

Look in his eyes.

Yes, it is you.

Hi.

Hi.

Don't just stand there.

Get yourself inside.

So where are you living now?

Not around here, I'm sure.

I'm in London.

Oh, how fancy.

- Whereabouts?

Do you live by yourself?

Do you own your own place?

Uh, yeah, it's just a flat.

What did I tell you?

What did I tell you?

I told you he'd be doing well for himself, didn't I?

Can't be cheap, living up there in the smoke.

And what is it that you do?

I'm a writer.

And what did I tell you?

No, no, no, I'm not particularly rich or anything.

Not really.

No, I always knew you'd be creative.

What kind of writer are you?

You know how I love Stephen King,

Carrie, Cujo, Different Seasons.

No, no, no, I'm not a proper writer.

I write scripts for film.

TV when I have to.

A writer.

God, this is so bloody exciting.

If I knew the neighbours, I'd run over and I'd tell them right now.

I've always said that writers know less about the real world than almost anyone else.

What the hell would you know?

You could barely write joined-up.

It's true.

A writer.

Our son.

We're very bloody pleased to see you doing so well, then.

Here.

Enough of that puffy shit.

Our boy's back home.

What are you putting on?

Oh, you'll see.

Oh.

Oh, do you remember your little red car that you had?

You loved it and you wanted to take it out onto the main road and drive it with all the big cars.

It's my first memory, actually.

It was a Ford Granada that hit him, wasn't it?

And it-it was racing green.

Do you remember that?

Mmm.

It flung you, -uh, like a rag doll.

You went so high up in the air that I'll never forget it.

Oh, but you were fine, though.

You were fine. You had a couple of bruises.

I think they thought I was exaggerating when I took you in.

What about that one bonfire night when you lost it?

Remember that bonfire night?

How old were you? Six?

No, he was not. He was older than that.

The fireworks went off.

Poor boy, he started screaming and howling.

Had to carry him all the way home.

He did? Yeah.

Fell asleep on my shoulder.

I don't remember that.

You were really beside yourself.

You were really having a hard time.

And we were just trying to get you to enjoy the fireworks.

You've always been a sensitive boy.

Yeah.

Are you still afraid of fireworks now?

No.

Do you know what you said about?

You sound just like my mother.

He does.

Doesn't he? Did you notice that?

He did say something, though.

Yeah, it's when he speaks to me.

I don't know.

It's been so bloody lovely to see you again.

We weren’t sure we ever would.

But.

Here you are.

Here I am.

Come back soon, hm?

One of us will be in.

Please.

Yeah, I will.

Good.

Let's go in.

Good night, sweetheart.

Good night, son.

Bye.

Hello.

Hi.

I'm really sorry about the other night.

Oh, it's all right.

Don't worry about it.

See ya.

See ya.

I actually do like whiskey.

Do you want to have a drink, or?

Hi.

Hello.

Hi.

Hi.

Do you want to come in?

Sure.

Do you want a drink?

Yeah.

What have you got?

I've got vodka and some beer.

And some weed, if you prefer.

Yeah.

Weed's better.

I'm off alcohol.

Do you like living here?

I think I like it more when people move in.

If people move in.

You've got friends nearby?

No.

Not really.

Do you? No, not really.

Most of my friends have moved out of London.

They want gardens for their kids.

They want to be near their grandparents so they can look after their kids.

I'm guessing you didn't want to move too?

Uh, no.

What am I going to do in Dorking?

It's not for people like me.

I'm just checking you are queer, right?

Yeah.

That's good.

Or gay.

Queer, I'm not.

I can't get used to  calling myself queer.

It was always such an insult.

It's probably why we hate gay so much now.

I mean, it was always like...

Your haircut's gay.

The sofa's gay.

Your trainers are gay.

Your school bag's gay.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Queer does feel polite somehow, though.

You know, it's like, um...

I don't know.

It's like all the dick-sucking's been taken out.

Yeah.

I'm assuming you're not with anyone.

Never see you with anyone.

No.

No.

You often single?

Am I often single?

Mm-hmm.

I suppose so, yeah.

Mm.

Are you?

Yeah.

Yeah.

But not for want of trying.

How about I kiss you?

Okay.

Sorry.

You all right? No, yeah, yeah.

Just haven't done...

Haven't done this in a while.

Just remember to breathe.

Okay.

Okay.

You all right?

Uh-huh.

Is this you?

I'm afraid it is.

Man, you were cute.

I hate my photos.

I was a fat kid.

Right?

But when you're a fat kid, no one asks why you don't have a girlfriend.

Mm.

We'd have been friends for sure, though.

Bunked off football to spy on the boys.

This your dad?

Yeah.

He's handsome.

Yeah.

I'm...

I'm trying to write about him at the moment.

Is that what you do?

Yeah.

How's it going?

Uh...

Strangely.

I don't see my dad much.

Do you, uh...

Do you see yours, though?

No, they died.

Just before I was 12.

Both of them? Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

A car crash.

Not the most original of deaths.

I'm really sorry.

No, thanks.

It was a long time ago.

Yeah, I don't think that matters.

I'd like to see you again.

Yeah, okay.

I could stay the night if you...

How about actually better idea?

Not tonight.

Yeah?

No, no, I would like to see you again.

You don't need to explain.

Okay.

Okay.

Thanks.

Sweetheart, you came back.

Of course I came back.

Jesus, you're sodden.

Come on, take it all off.

No, I'm not taking my clothes off.

Don't be silly.

It's only me.

Come on, arms up.

I'll put them in the dryer.

It's just me today.

Is that all right?

Yeah, of course it is.

Good.

There's so much I want to know.

I want to hear everything.

Right, go on, upstairs.

Get changed.

My goodness, this is so exciting.

I suppose nothing's going to fit you anymore, is it? 

Nope. - Yeah, well, I bought you some of your dad's things instead.

Okay.

Oh, look, come on, take these off as well, and I'll put them in to dry with the rest.

Uh... Oh, will you take them off, Adam?

Honestly.

God, look at you.

What?

You were just a boy.

And now you're not.

Nope.

You're totally different, but it's still you.

Well, I thought you'd be hairier.

Like your dad.

Okay, sorry.

Like a hairy chest myself.

Okay.

Christ, you know who you remind me of?

Uh, who?

You look just like my dad.

Did he?

Mm.

Or how I remember him anyway when I was a little girl.

God, isn't that mad?

It's like seeing you both at exactly the same time.

Oh.

I've made your favorite.

Well, I hope it's still your favorite.

I'll just go and pop the kettle on, and then you can tell me everything.

Delicious.

Mm, good.

Now, your dad told me not to ask, and I don't see a wedding ring, so I'm presuming you're not married, but have you got a girlfriend?

Hmm?

I'm picturing her with brown hair, not too skinny, smart, obviously.

Well?

Well, what?

Do you?

I don't have a girlfriend, no.

Oh.

That's a shame.

I don't have a girlfriend because I'm not into girls.

Into women.

What do you mean?

I mean...

I'm gay.

As in homosexual?

As in that, yeah.

Really?

Yeah.

Since when?

Since a long time.

Since a long time.

Forever?

You don't look gay.

Well, I'm not sure what that means.

It means what it means.

You know what it means.

Well, I bet you're glad you don't know the neighbors now.

Hmm.

I must admit, I'm a bit surprised.

I'm not really sure what I feel about it.

What?

You didn't think it would be a possibility?

No, of course not.

What parent wants to think that about their child? Not the parent that I know.

Well, I'm very okay with it, so...

Well, I'm very okay with it, so...

Aren't people nasty to you?

No, no.

Things are different now.

So, they aren't nasty.

Not allowed, anyway.

But does everybody know?

I mean, are you open about it?

I mean, I don't know, down the high street at WHSmiths?

Well, it depends on the street.

Yeah.

Everybody knows. Everyone's fine.

Well, don't you want to get married and have kids?

Well, don't you want to get married and have kids?

I can have kids.

Men can marry.

Women, too.

What, to each other?

Yeah.

Why?

What do you mean, why?

Well, isn't that like having your cake and eating it?

So, do you want to get married and have kids?

I don't know.

It wasn't a possibility for such a long time, so I didn't think it was worth the effort of wanting to get married and have kids.

You okay?

Mm, fine.

Sure?

I suppose I never did know what was going on in that odd little head of yours.

You were always running away.

Do you remember?

Yeah.

It was that time that you got as far as the train station, but then you'd lost your money, and so you couldn't buy a ticket.

Do you remember that?

Yes.

It was Granny's five pound note.

Yeah, that was it.

Where were you hoping to go?

I don't know.

London, I guess.

London? God.

Or there was that time that you got as far as the bottom of the garden, but then you cut your thumb on an old milk bottle, and you came running back up all sheepish, blood all over your shirt, and you were banging and banging on that window to be let in.

Yeah.

There it is.

Just.

Yeah.

Hmm.

They say it's a very lonely kind of life.

They don't actually say that anymore.

So you're not lonely?

If I am, it's not because I'm gay.

Not really.

Not really?

Oh, God, and what about this awful, ghastly disease?

I've seen the adverts on the, on the news and with the gravestone.

Should I be worried about that?

No. Jesus.

Everything is different now.

Everything is different.

Well, I guess I wouldn't know about that.

Your clothes should be dry now.

You can take these flapjacks with you if you want.

I won't be eating them.

What's wrong?

Um, I'm okay.

Just, just got a bit of a chill.

Really?

You're hot.

Yeah.

I was just, I was just,

I just got caught in the rain.

Okay.

Well, why don't I run you a hot bath?

My nan says there's literally nothing a hot bath couldn't solve.

I don't really like baths.

Fuck off.

Who doesn't like baths?

You don't need to be shy around me.

Yes.

That's easier said than done.

Would you like me to close my eyes? 

Yes, please.

Better.?

Yeah.

I’ve been thinking about you a whole heap today.

Hmm.

I was thinking about watching crappy TV with you on a Friday night.

Mm-hmm.

Eating takeaway on your sofa.

Watching old episodes of Top of the Pops from before I was born.

Thought about something else, too.

Thought about fucking you.

Really?

Yeah.

Or you fucking me,

I don't really care which.

Are you into that?

Yeah.

It's okay if you're not.

We don't all need to be into fucking.

I wasn't for the longest time.

For obvious reasons.

Obvious reasons?

I felt that if I fucked anyone,

I'd die.

It's probably pretty difficult for you to imagine.

Yeah.

Well, not all.

Yeah.

You said the other day you don't see your dad much.

Yeah.

How about your mom?

Yeah, sick.

How come?

They know you're queer?

Yeah, of course.

And they okay with it?

Yeah.

They're okay.

I mean they're really old-school.

Probably less okay than everyone's meant to be.

Yeah.

Never got used to it, sort of.

Just don't say too much.

You could say that I have drifted to the edge.

Or right up to the edge, almost.

Over the edge.

What's that mean?

Yeah, I'm the edge of the family.

My sister and her kids.

My older brother just got married.

They've got this spot in the center.

That's okay.

Why is it okay?

Because.

I don't go home much.

Does that make you sad?

Yeah.

Um...

No, I think it's just inevitable, really.

Why?

Um...

I've always felt like a stranger in my own family.

And then... coming out just puts an end to that difference.

It's always been there.

It's only endless.

It's not really anyone's fault.

What's wrong?

It's funny.

Things are better now. Of course they are.

It doesn't take much to make you feel the way you felt.

Back there again. It's game over.

Am I still hot?

It's a little.

You gonna stay the night?

I'm sure she won't be long.

It's okay.

I just wanted to talk to her.

Yeah, I know you did.

This was your grandad's favorite.

I never really liked it much at the time, but... it's grown on me.

If you want to see your mom really lose her shit, go ahead and break that bloody thing.

Ugh.

Come on then, lads.

Sit yourself down.

What she told you then?

Scared you wouldn't come back.

But you know what your mom's like.

Don't be...Don't be too disappointed in her.

No, I'm not.

She just needs to rearrange some things in her head and all the stories that she's built up.

She'll soon realize it's not actually about her.

What about you?

What about me?

What do you think?

Well...

I mean, it was only a shock.

I always knew you were a bit tooty-fruity.

Couldn't throw a ball for shit no matter how many times I tried to teach you.

Jesus.

Couldn't fish. Couldn't do it.

You make me sound like a horrible cliche.

Well, can you throw a ball?

Not at all.

Well, there you go.

Would you have liked me to have known?

I don't know.

I would hear you crying in your room after school.

Did the boys bully you then?

Not just the boys.

What would they do?

Oh, call me a girl.

Ignore me.

Refuse to play with me.

Stick my head down the toilet.

Flick drawing pins in my face.

Exactly.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Kids are little cunts, aren't they.

So why didn't you come into my room if you heard me crying?

Why didn't you tell me what was happening at school?

You know, you answer me first.

Be honest.

I just didn't want to think of you as the kind of boy that the other lads would pick on.

And I knew that if I was at your school

I'd probably have picked on you too.

Yeah, I think I always probably thought that anyway.

Probably why I didn't tell you what was happening to me at school.

You know, when she told me it did make me think about other jokes that we make.

Yeah, well, we did impressions of your English teacher when he mints around with his limp wrist.

You told me not to cross my legs like a woman over and over and over again.

Did I?

Yeah, I still.

I still think about it every time I cross my legs.

I have good memories too.

Yeah, I hope so.

I hope so. I hope you did.

Ha, ha.

Remember you used to love decorating the tree?

You went crazy for it every year.

And you'd always let me put the fairy on top of the tree.

I did.

Sorry I never came in your room when you were crying.

No, really, it's okay.

It's not okay though, really, is it?

It's not-

Dad, I get it. It was so long-

It was so long ago.

Stop.

Can I hug you now?

Yeah, please.

You're all right, son.

You're all right.

After this,

I want to go out.

You... and me... together... into the world.

What'd you wanna drink?

Uhh... A pint.

Where'd you get this?

Out of my wallet.

Fuck knows how long it's been there.

I think that's Ketamine.

Oh, really?

Have you done it before?

No.

Will you look after.

I'll do my best.

Okay.

Okay.

Adam?

What's wrong?

Oh, you're really hot.

Oh, he's really hot.

Huh?

Here you go.

Squeeze in, squeeze in, squeeze in.

All those lonely, lonely times.

And I guess I never told you.

I'm so happy that you're mine.

If I made you feel the second best.

I'm so sorry I was blind.

You were always on my mind.

Tell me.

Tell me that you're sweet like a diamond.

Love is undying.

Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied.

Satisfied.

Satisfied.

Bye-bye.

Okay, get together.

Yeah, you ready?

Okay, let's go.

Merry Christmas.

Is this real?

Does it feel real?

Yeah.

There you go then.

For how long, though?

I can't answer that.

I suppose we don't get to decide when it's over.

You're not going out now, are you?

Where would we go?

The Walsh's.

The Walsh's?

The Walsh's.

No, no.

Wait.

You'd promise me you're gonna go out now.

I promise.

We're just gonna be asleep next door.

Right?

Get some sleep.

What is it, sweetheart?.

I can't sleep.

Do you want to get in?

Can I?

Of course you can.

It still smells the same in here.

You'd creep in here night after night saying you couldn't sleep.

You're always scared of something.

Murderers breaking in, or rabies, or nuclear war.

Do people still get rabies?

No.

I was desperate for you to grow up just so I could get a good night's sleep.

Sorry.

What are you sorry for?

I'm the sorry one.

I should have relished you driving me bananas.

Where did you go?

You know, afterwards.

Lived with Granny.

She took me to Dublin.

Yeah, I thought so.

Why didn't you live with his slop?

Why didn't you live with Granny May?

They said she was too heartbroken.

About what?

Well, she'd lost her son.

Oh, I see. But my mother was fine about losing her only daughter.

No, no.

She was not fine.

I just can't believe that she got to look after you and I didn't.

Are any of them still around now?

They wouldn't be, would they?

And how did you get on over there with my Mum?

Did you manage to fit in better at school?

I made sure I did.

I hate that we weren't around when you needed to smoke, sweetheart.

And I hate even more that I wasn't there before then.

Not really.

No, that's not true.

Oh, come on.

I was hardly mother of the year, was I?

But I like to think that I would have got better at it in time.

In a given time.

You know, when I was a teenager, even later, into my twenties,

I used to plot it all out.

What do you mean?

What we might have done together.

In intricate detail.

Trips to the Whitgift Centre.

Birthdays.

You know, trips to London.

The Planetarium.

The London Dungeon.

Oh, I always wanted to go there.

I know.

Or holidays that we might have gone on together.

Oh, did we make it to Disneyland?

We did.

When I was fourteen.

It rained non-stop.

And they shut down Space Mountain.

And we fought every day.

Why did we have to fight?

Because that's what everyone did with their parents.

They fought and bickered and pretended that they were ruining each other's lives.

Did we make up?

No, we didn't need to make up.

We were together.

So...

Is that it, Mum?

You okay?

No.

You're okay, son.

You're okay.

What are you doing here?

You're not supposed to be here.

You're okay.

What day is it? Sunday.

How come-Wh-Why is it still Sunday?

You kept screaming out for your parents over and over again in the club.

And I didn't know what to do.

So I just... took you back here and lay with you until you fell asleep.

You looked so scared.

I am.

Here, come here, come here.

Oh, dear God.

Shh.

Shh.

I'm here. It's okay.

You're okay.

Shh.

I was sleeping in their bed the night they went out.

I was meant to go with them to Christmas drinks at the Walsh's around midnight.

Two police came to the door, a man and a woman.

He had really beautiful, kind eyes and this thick, dark stubble.

It looked like it had been drawn on.

The car skidded on black ice.

Both of them had been drinking.

Dad was killed right away, but they took Mum to

St Mary's in Croydon and she died a few days later.

Did you get to see her?

What do you mean?

To say goodbye?

Mm-hmm, yeah.

No.

My granny told it would be too scarring.

Mum went through the windscreen and she lost an eye, so she was pretty fucked up.

Jesus.

Yeah.

I went looking for that eye.

I don't know why.

I didn't want anyone else to find it.

I thought it would be on the side of the road.

She's staring up at me.

Hi.

I did find a tiny piece of the windscreen glass then.

In my head it had blood on it, but maybe that's not true.

The nurse said that Mum woke up just before she died.

It must have been so confusing.

You can hardly see.

Dad wasn't there.

I wasn't there.

I can't even begin to imagine how you felt.

How lonely you must have been.

Yeah, but I...

I'd always felt lonely...

Even before.

This was a new feeling.

Like, uh... terror.

That I'd always... be alone now.

And then, as I got older, that feeling just... solidified.

It just... uh... just did not... here all the time.

And then losing them, I just got tangled up with all the other stuff.

Like being gay, and... just feeling like... the future doesn't matter.

Does that make sense?

Yeah...

I know how easy it can be to stop caring about yourself.

Adam.

Will you come with me?

Where to?

Just let me show you.

Whose house is this?

My parents'.

Yeah?

Who lives here now?

It's okay.

Don't worry.

Hello?

Adam.

Hello?

Where are they?

Who?

Hello?

Who?

My parents'.

This is our house.

This is our kitchen.

This is our wallpaper.

That's our table, where we had fish and chips every Friday night, so my mother could pretend we were still Catholic.

Adam, I want to go home.

Let me take you home.

This is my home.

No, it used to be.

Mom!

Adam! 

Dad!

Adam, listen.

Let me take you home.

Look!

You go home.

You go home.

I'm not going.

Where are they?

Where are they?

Mom? Dad?

Can you see them?

Please.

Please.

Please let me in.

Please let me in.

Why didn't you let us in?

Where is he?

Is he-Harry here?

No.

We did see him though.

I wanted you to meet him.

I know, but I don't think this works like that.

He look like a handsome fellow, though.

Is he your special friend?

Do you mean my boyfriend?

Is he my boyfriend?

You can say it.

Okay.

Well, is he your boyfriend?

Um...

I-I don't know.

Are you in love with him?

Why is that so strange?

I don't know. I've never been in love before, so...

Not really.

So this...

I don't know if this is it.

Sweetheart.

Well, he certainly seems to care about you a whole heap.

In my not-so-humble opinion.

Do you think you'd like to be in love with him?

So...

I think we need to... No.

Don't say it.

Please don't say it.

We have to. We have to.

Um...

Me and your mum...

We think that it's best you don't come visit us anymore.

Of course.

You're just gonna keep coming and coming.

I know you are.

And we can see what this is doing to you.

It's not doing anything to me.

Yes, it is.

It won't let you move on.

Okay, well, I'll come less.

I'll come once a year.

I'll come at Christmas.

Come on, lad.

You have to have known that this wasn't gonna last forever.

I'm not asking for it to last forever.

I'm just...

It hasn't been long enough.

It hasn't been close to long enough.

I know, but it never could be, could it?

Hey, listen.

I've got an idea.

How's about...

How's about we got your favourite place in the whole bloody world?

Oh.

I'm sure it's still open.

An express thing to Disneyland.

It's fucking cheaper, too.

Tiger?





Uhh, can we get the family special, please.

It's a lot of food

It's okay

I'm not really very hungry.

No, me neither.

No.

Hey, I wanna ask you something.

God, no. Don't ask him

- No, I'm gonna ask him.

Was it quick?

Oh, Jesus, I told you not to ask.

You-You're the-You want to know.

But what if it was slow and horribly painful?

What difference does it make?

It's a big difference.

It was quick.

Was it?

Yeah.

For both of us?

Uh-huh.

No, you don't seem sure.

Don't be fibbing now.

It was quick.

It was really quick.

Oh, OK.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, well, that's a relief, isn't it?

Sort of.

It's been playing on my mind, that is.

What do you think we should say to each other?

I'm not sure I have much wisdom to share.

I don't know.

Maybe Adam, being older, should be sharing some with us.

Maybe we shouldn't say anything.

Maybe.

Although I will say that getting to know you has made us very proud, son.

I haven't done anything to be proud of.

I've just muddled through.

No, but you got through it.

Some tough times, I'm sure.

And you're still here.

Mm-hmm.

It's what we're proud of.

Yeah.

Dad.

Stay.

Stay.

Stay a bit longer.

I don't think so, son.

I love you, darling.

You do?

Sometimes I wasn't so sure.

Whatever problems we had, I'm glad we got to be together at the end.

I know I was never good at saying it.

I just couldn't get the words out.

But I do love you very much.

Somehow, even more, now that I know you.

It's important that you believe me.

I do.

I know I love you very much.

Dad?

Dad? Dad, did you hear that?

Adam, are you there?

I can't see you.

Why can't I see you?

I'm here, Mom.

Oh, there you are.

I can feel you.

Your skin's lovely and warm.

Now, you listen.

You promised me that you're going to try with this Harry boy.

Yeah.

I'd have liked him.

I know it.

He might need a bit of taking care of, might you?

He's got such a sad face.

Do you hear me?

Yeah, yeah. I hear you.

That's good.

I hope you make each other a bit happier.

Such a kind and gentle boy.

Enjoy.

Thank you.

Harry?

What are you doing down here?

I-I came to find you.

Why are you here?

I said goodbye to them, so I came to see you.

It's okay.

It's not okay, though, is it?

I was so scared that night.

I just needed to not be alone.

I'm sorry.

I was too scared.

To let you in. 

I'm in there, aren't I?

Let's just go upstairs.

No, no, no, no, no.

I just need you to tell me, okay?

Because I can smell it.

I can taste it in my throat.

How come no one found me?

Well, it was my mum and my dad.

I found you.

No, but I...

Adam, I don't want you to see me like that in there.

You're not in there. You're not in there.

You're not in there.

You're here.

You're here.

You're here.

You're here.

With me.

Let's just go upstairs.

I saw her, you know.

Your mum.

Your dad, too.

The house.

They saw you, too.

They did?

My dad said you were a handsome fellow.

They'd love you.

They both would.

Oh, Scott.

Did you get to say what you wanted to say?

I don't know. I got to be with them.

It's good that you're all together.

Yeah.

I'm scared.

I know.

But I'm here with you.

Don't let this get tangled up again.

Okay, come on.

Okay.

It's so quiet.

I never could stand how quiet this place was.

Will you put a record on?

What would you like? 

You choose.

I'll protect you from the Hooded Claw.

Keep the vampires from your door.

Yeah. That one.

Some boys chased him in the cut.

He's scared more than anything.

He wouldn't tell me where he lived 'til this morning.

Well, thanks for seeing to him.

No place you can go in the world ain't got no black people.

We's the first on this planet.

But I'm from Cuba.

Lot a black folks in Cuba, you wouldn't know that from being here, though.

I was a wild li'l shorty, man, just like you.

Runnin' around with no shoes on when the moon was out.

This one time...

I run by this old... this old lady.

I was runnin', hollerin'... cuttin' a fool, boy.

This old lady, she stopped me.

She said...

"Running around, catching up all that light.

In moonlight... black boys look blue.

You blue.

That's what I gon' call you.

Blue."

So your name Blue?

Nah.

At some point you gotta decide for yourself who you gon' be.

Can't let nobody make that decision for you.

That's all I'm gon' say about that.

Thank you.

What's a faggot?

A faggot is... a word used to make gay people feel bad.

- Am I a faggot?

- No.

No.

You can be gay, but you gotta let nobody call you no faggot.

I mean, unless...

How do I know?

You just do.

I think.

You'll know when you know.

Hey...

You ain't gotta know right now, all right?

Not yet.

Do you sell drugs?

Yeah.

And my mama...

She do drugs, right?

Yeah.

Okay, deoxyribonucleic acid.

Long word, right?

All right, it's basically genes.

I know y'all don't know what that means, but just hang with me for a second.

So it's basically this long...

Chiron, you need something?

Hey, yo, that nigga forgot to change his tampon.

I'm sorry, Mr. Pierce.

He just having woman problems today.

Ain't that right, Little?

All right, Terrel, that's enough.

Nah, can't be enough for Little.

- Don't call me that!

All right, Terrel, that's it.

Hey, what you gonna do, Chiron?

I fuck you up.

Hey, yo, Terrel! Out!

Come on, man.

What's wrong with you?

Damn, nigga.

Yo, school been out.

Why she got to compliment a nigga for?

So I'm like, "A'ight, like, shit, we can do this", you know?

So I started banging her back out, dawg.

I'm talking

I'm banging her back out.

She went and made all this fucking noise, though.

So Aimes come in, acting like 5-0 and shit, almost had my ass suspended, dawg.

I talked it out, though, you know.

I told him we was like childhood sweethearts and all of that, so I just got detention.

It's cool.

I know Juan used to give you that gin.

But we ain't doing that up in here, shorty.

You don't think my joke was funny?

What's wrong?

Nothing. I'm good.

No. I've seen good and you ain't it.

Stop putting your head down in my house. You know my rule.

It's all love and all pride in this house.

You feel me?

I can't hear you.

- Do you feel me?

- Yeah.

- Okay.

All right.

Thank you for this.

Boy, please, you know you can stay here any time you need to.

Okay? Any time.

Yeah.

Thank you, Teresa.

I mean it.

Now, if you gon' stay here, though, you gonna have to learn how to make a bed better than this, boy.

- What?

- What you mean, "What"?

Give me that.

That ain't how you make up no bed.

You think you slick, too.

You know, do it all wrong so Teresa can come over here and do it right.

Mm-hmm.

I know what you doing.

Oof, you and Juan.

Y'all two, thick as thieves.

Give me that.

All right.

Do you need anything else from me, sweetheart?

- Uh, no, I'm good.

- Okay.

All right, I'm gonna wake you up in the morning.

You good, Black?

Chiron!

- Hey! Hey, baby!

- Hey, Mama.

- What?

Why?

Well, I'm yo' mama, ain't I?

Why you ain't just come home later, boy?

You had me worried about you.

I guess you getting grown.

I can't be keeping up with you all the time.

Anyway, baby, how Teresa doing?

I ain't seen her since the funeral.

Listen, Mama locked herself out the door, yeah?

Can you come let her in?

Come on, baby.

Let me in, baby.

Baby, come on.

Mama, I thought you...

Wait, Mama... Mama!

For what?

That's my business.

Don't you ask me no shit like that.

- I don't have no money...

- No, no. Don't lie to me, boy.

I'm your mama. That bitch over there ain't no kin of you.

I'm your blood, remember?

Now I ain't feeling good.

I need something to help me out.

Come on, baby.

Come on, baby.

Where am I supposed to get money from?

What?

Teresa ain't give you nothing, huh?

Your li'l play-play mama ain't put something in your hand?

Give me that damn money, Chiron.

Give me the damn money!

Give me the damn money!

I don't have no money!

- Mama, come on...

All right! All right!

Give me the damn money.

Yes. That is what I thought.

I know that bitch like a hooker know her trick.

You my child, okay?

And tell that bitch she better not forget it.

Go on to school.

Ain't you late?

So you can see how a lack of white blood cells can be dangerous to the human body, right?

Okay, can anybody explain what will happen to the body if there's not enough white blood cells?

Ain't nobody's leaving this classroom until I get a response.

This is more important for you than it is for me, trust me.

- [Terrell Hey, yo, Little!

Roll out into the water like all these other motherfuckers around here trying to drown they sorrows.

Why you say that?

That's the game, ain't it?

You dare me to swing on him and if I do, it's on you.

Yo, Kev.

How you like that, Chiron?

Yo, I think he want another one.

- Another one. Do it.

- Give it to him.

- Don't you get up, bruh.

- You stay down!

Yeah, if he get up, knock his faggot ass back down.

- Chiron, stay down!

- He got up.

- Come on, man.

- Stay down.

Do it again.

- Do it!

- Do it! Move!

Listen, son...

If you don't press charges,

I can't stop this from happening.

Understand?

You don't even know.

- Oh, I don't?

- Nuh-uh.

You think all this just started, boy?

- I ain't no boy.

- The hell you ain't.

If you were a man, there'd be four other knuckleheads sittin' right next to you.

You don't even know.

Listen, son, listen.

Listen.

I'm not blaming you... I'm not.

I know it's hard.

Believe me.

I'm not trying to disrespect your struggle.

I just need you to know...

All right, all right.

Stay focused.

Hey... Hey, Chiron!

Get the fuck off me, nigga!

Get the fuck off me!

Don't look at me!

- Hello, homie.

- Yo, what's good with you, B?

Vibing, vibing?

- What's good?

- You vibin'?

- I'm trying to.

- Trying to?

So where the hos at?

Nigga, you smiling and shit like you don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

Where the hos at, nigga?

I don't know. You tell me.

There's this bitch that stay down the corner.

What's her name?

- Afrodesia.

- You making it up.

I don't believe you.

I ain't never seen you with no bitch,

I don't believe you.

- Her name Afrodesia.

- Her name Afrodesia? Where she at?

- She only come out at night.

- Okay.

- Yeah.

- Okay.

You short, Travis.

- Wait, what?

- Where the rest of the roll?

It's all there.

I mean, you might could think I'm trouble, when I handed it to you it was all there.

It's a'ight. If it's all there, then count that shit then, Trav.

Count it, if it's all there.

Move, you're in my spot.

Move.

Give me my fucking money, man.

You sayin' I'm a liar?

All right.

I ain't say that.

I told you to count what's off and you said it wasn't.

That's you calling me a liar.

Nah, all I did was tell you that...

You... you did what?

Nah, I'm just fucking with you.

Huh?

Count good.

Did real good. Here.

Can't be on the corner if you can't take a nigga just fuckin' with you,

- you feel me?

- Yeah.

Chiron, this your mama.

I know it's late, but I...

I figured you ain't never been one much for sleep.

Atlanta ain't but so big.

It seems to me you come see your mama from time to time.

Hope you gettin' some rest, baby.

Hope you come by soon.

Ma, it's late.

I'll be there tomorrow, I promise.

Hello?

Hey, Black...

I mean, uh, Chiron.

What's up, man?

This, uh... this Kevin.

You there?

Yeah.

Long time, no see, right?

Man, I had to ask Teresa for your number, and...

Hold up, man. You... you do remember me, right?

Yeah, I do.

Been a while.

Yeah. Yeah, it has, man.

So, uh, where you at now, man?

Georgia. Atlanta.

- I've been up here ever since...

- Yeah. Yeah, man, that's what I heard.

Yeah.

Hey, man, I'm sorry about all that...

All that... shit.

What went down... Chiron.

Real shit, dawg, I am.

So, uh... what you doin' up there, man?

Not much. Just... just trouble.

Chiron and trouble always found a way.

Yeah... somethin' like that.

- What about you?

- Me?

I'm a cook, man.

Y... y... you a cook?

Yeah, buddy.

Man, I got sent up for some stupid shit, the same stupid shit we always get sent up for.

They put me on the kitchen line, man, and... kinda took to it.

Anyway, man, I just...

I just thought about you, man, I...

We got this jukebox in here and, uh... folks come by and play they songs, that's the music we get in here, and it's...

This dude, man...

Just reminded me of you.

So, uh...

Hey, man, if you ever come to town, man, you come holla at me.

I'll cook you somethin'.

Maybe...

Maybe play that song for you.

All right, man, um...

You be easy, all right?

How you been?

I'm all right.

I ain't sleepin'.

Why not?

- Right. If you knew, you'd...

- Bad dreamin'.

Still?

You ever thought about talking about it with somebody?

Maybe not even a counselor, maybe somebody like your mama?

Yeah...

Yeah, it sound funny to me too.

You talk to Teresa?

- Yeah.

- Mm.

How she doing?

Good.

"Good."

When you go home, Ma?

Home?

This is home. You know...

I mean, they allowing me to stay and work as long as I like. I figure...

Might as well help other folks.

Keep myself out of trouble.

- That's good, Mama.

- Yeah.

Yeah, I think it is too.

I really do.

So, you still in them streets?

Didn't come all the way the hell to Georgia to have you fallin' in the same shit, Chiron.

- Imma go. Imma go...

- No, no, no, no, you gon' listen!

To who, Ma? Huh?

To you?

Really, though?

Please... please.

I messed up.

I fucked it all the way up.

I know that.

But yo' heart ain't gotta be black like mine, baby.

I love you, Chiron.

I do.

I love you, baby.

I mean, you ain't gotta love me.

Lord knows I did not have love for you when you needed it, I know that.

So you ain't gotta love me.

But you gon' know that I love you.

You hear?

You hear me, Chiron?

I hear you, Mama.

Here.

I'm sorry, baby.

I'm so sorry.

Come here, Mama.

Be right with you.

How y'all doin'?

Good? All right.

I'll take these.

I'll be right back with your check.

Be right with you, boss, just let me get this out the way.

All right...

All right, man, how you doing tonight?

What can I get you...

Chiron?

Damn man, why you ain't say nothin'?

'Sup, Kev?

Damn, man, what...

What you doing down here?

I mean...

Hey! hey...

You here now, man, that's all that matter.

There you go with that damn noddin' again, man.

You ain't... you ain't changed one damn bit.

You still can't say more than three words at a time, huh?

Said you was gon' cook for me.

I know how to say that.

Yeah, I did say that, didn't I?

Don't look like your ass been missing no meals.

Yeah.

But I got you, man.

Sit down.

Sit down, man.

What you want?

You can order off the menu if you want to, or...

Hey... I could just hit you with that chef's special.

Yeah.

We here, Chiron.

One chef's special... coming right up.

Chef's special.

Oh, so you Cuban now?

Only in the kitchen, papi.

Yo, sit down, man, or are you gon' eat standin' up?

You want a drink?

Nah, I don't drink.

Nigga, I ain't seen you in like a decade.

You gon' drink with me.

Boom.

Nah, bruh, nah, bruh...

What you doing, man?

Welcome back, bruh.

Damn, brother, I thought you said you didn't drink.

Can't really taste it, so I don't mess with it.

- I saw that. I saw that.

- What? What?

You don't wanna waste none of that, do you? It tastes good.

Chill out, man.

It's straight, bruh.

- Say what?

- It's straight.

"It's straight."

Man, please, it's better than Chef Boyardee, ain't it?

Chill out, bruh.

My Spaghetti-O's go hard, man.

Hey, eat your dinner, man.

Eat your dinner.

Got it, Mr. George?

I'll be back.

Hey, man, you... you remember Samantha?

Fine-ass Samantha.

Yeah, I remember her.

Yeah?

Check this out.

Kevin Jr.

Me and Samantha, man.

We had him young. Shit, too young.

Man, when I got locked up, man, that shit was hard.

Wasn't no way I could go back the streets, man. Not after this.

- Y'all still down?

- Me and Sam?

Nah. I mean, we... we cool.

We gotta be, you know,

'cause of li'l man, but...

Nah, not like that, man.

But what about you, bruh?

What about me?

Nigga... tell me somethin'.

I mean, what you doin'?

Who you doin'?

Man, come on now. I've been back there in that kitchen, man, and cooked for your ass and everything, man.

Hey, these grandma rules, man.

You know the deal.

Your ass eat, your ass speak.

All right... straight up?

Yeah, nigga, straight up.

I'm trappin'.

- What?

- Yeah.

When they sent me to Atlanta, put me straight into juvie for beatin' the old boy.

Met this dude in there.

When I come out, he put me on the block.

Did good at it and rose up.

It is what it is.

Bullshit, man.

That ain't what it is.

That ain't you, Chiron.

Nigga, you don't know me.

I don't know you?

There you are.

Twenty-four fifty.

Want the change?

- All right.

- Bye.

Why you got them damn fronts, man?

Why'd you call me?

What?

Why did you call me?

I told you, man.

- Dude came in...

- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

He played this song, man...

This you?

You wasn't playin'

'bout them traps, huh?

Ride dirty, huh?

Something like that.

So, how you be gettin' to work?

Bus. Jitney.

Sometimes Samantha shoot me out there when I got Li'l Kev.

I can't picture bein' in Miami with no car.

- Man, it's real out here.

- Yeah, I bet.

Real hot, real slow, and real busted.

Shot me like a duck out here, man.

This nigga said "a duck."

- Yeah, you on one. You on one.

- You know what I'm doin'.

Nah, I'm just tired, bruh.

Hey, man, bet on the ride, though.

- Yeah.

- Appreciate it.

Yeah, man.

Can't have yo ass on no Jitney.

So, Chiron...

What... what you looking at me like that for?

What, man? Come on, you just drove down here?

Yeah.

Like you was just... you was just on one... and you hit the highway?

Yeah.

So where you gon' stay tonight, man?

- Watch that shit.

- I got you.

- This the spot.

- What?

Come on in.

Get yourself at home.

- This is real, man.

- I'm just... get out of this real quick.

You a'ight?

No. Yeah, no, I just got a little headache.

Man, you a lightweight.

Nah, you was pouring that mug.

You was pouring it.

- "I can't taste this".

- Chill out, man.

We had like three bottles.

Yeah, three bottles. I'll make you some green tea, man, come on.

I won't be drinking that shit either, man.

- What do you drink?

- Water.

Who is you, man?

Who, me?

Yeah, nigga. You.

I'm saying, man, them fronts.

That car.

Who is you, Chiron?

I'm me, man.

I ain't tryin' to be nothin' else.

Oh, okay.

So you hard now?

I ain't say that.

Well, then what?

Hey, hey, hey, I ain't tryin' to hem you up, man, it's just...

I ain't seen you in a minute and...

It's not what I expected.

Well, what did you expect?

You remember...

You remember the last time

I saw you?

For a long time, tried not to remember.

Tried to forget all those times.

Yeah.

When we got to Atlanta...

I started over.

Built myself from the ground up.

Built myself hard.

What about you? You...

Me?

I wasn't never really worth shit.

Just kept on, man.

Never really did anything

I actually wanted to do.

It was all I could do was to do what folks thought I should be doing.

I wasn't never really myself.

And now?

Now?

Now, man...

Now I got li'l Kev.

Got this job.

Another 18 months of probation.

That's some real shit, man.

Nah, man, it's a life.

You know?

I ain't never had that before.

Like...

Like, I'm tired as hell right now, man, and I ain't making no more than shoe money, but...

I ain't got no worries, man.

Not them kind what I had before.

That's that real shit.

That's that Bob Marley shit, nigga.

You the only man that's ever touched me.

You're the only one.

I haven't really touched anyone since.

## Anatomy of a fall

- Sorry.

- It's OK.

What do you want to know?

Just a sec, it hasn't recorded.

There.

So, the way you describe the son's accident...

It's troubling to read because we know it's your life.

Do you think one can only write from experience?

Come. Jump!

Jump!

Jump. C'mon!

Jump! Jump!

It leads me to an interesting story, and I decide to put you in the book I'm writing.

It's not more. You're in my book.

And yet, I don't know you.

What I do know about is my interest in you.

But still, you had to meet me first.

I'm real, in front of you now.

Yes, that you are.

Yeah, so, for you to start inventing, you need something real first.

You say your books always mix truth and fiction.

That makes us want to figure out which is which.

Is that your goal?

OK, get out.

Snoop, come!

Let's dry you off.

You're nice and clean.

No more dirt.

What would you write about?

It's Samuel working upstairs.

My husband.

So, what interests you?

What makes you so mad you want to explode?

Forget about your thesis, your studies.

I don't want to be a writer.

That's OK, you don't have to write, just talk, like we're talking now.

You don't want to go on with my questions?

Of course I do.

But we could chat too.

Maybe we ask one question each, so nobody's frustrated, like a normal conversation.

Are you really interested in...

What interests you?

Come on, sure.

I never see anybody,

I work here all day long, you come to see me, of course you interest me.

I run.

It's one of my favorite things to do.

Makes me feel high, like I'm on drugs.

What do you know about drugs?

That's the next question.

Big subject.

Maybe don't write everything down.

Surely not.

I told you, we should have done this in Grenoble.

It's fine.

I'll write your answers down.

But I have many questions.

Maybe you don't have the time.

Don't worry about time, time is not the problem here.

OK. Cool.

I'd like to discuss storytelling...

I don't like sports.

That's the first thing.

Walking yes, maybe.

Running, no!

OK, right, I get it.

So, you're...

It's not really possible anymore, is it?

Yes, it's complicated.

I think we have to stop, Zoé.

I'll be in Grenoble soon,

I'll give you a call.

Sorry about that.

- See you soon.

- Yes, for sure.

Careful.

Dad...

Mom!

Mom!

Mom, come quick!

Yes...

No, I don't know.

I didn't move him,

I didn't touch him at all.

He's not breathing, that's why I'm calling.

No, please come,

I can't answer all the questions.

No, he's not moving.

Please just come.

Samuel Maleski, found dead below his chalet...

Turning him now.

Full shot.

Close up.

I'll dictate the initial ideas.

Insert them before the conclusion.

The parallel, superficial abrasions on the hands and forearms suggest the body slid

1 or 2 meters upon impact before reaching its final, supine position.

A left temporal hematoma related to the fatal brain trauma indicates collision with a blunt object in the environment or a violent blow to the head.

Injury location is inconsistent with discovery position, thus impact occurred before the body hit the ground.

In conclusion, we cannot yet determine if the injury resulted from a collision or a blow.

We cannot, at this stage, rule out third party involvement.

Then, the usual.

CAUSE OF DEATH: HEAD TRAUMA.

FORENSIC CAUSE:

ACCIDENTAL AND/OR DELIBERATE.

Toxicological analysis needed to establish the truth.

Anatomy of a fall.

Thank you for coming.

It's really weird, seeing you again like this.

- It is.

- OK.

I didn't realize it was so high.

Yeah.

Come.

Have you lived here long?

Less than two years.

Samuel grew up here.

It's his...

Well...

How are we gonna do this?

Will you ask me some questions...

I'm really sorry my French isn't any better than when we met.

- No. English is fine.

- OK.

How many times have you been questioned?

It's been once here, by the policemen, and once by the investigative judge.

Can you tell me what you told them about the day he died?

Yes, of course.

I told them everything, from when I was with the student until the ambulance got here.

I was in the middle of a meeting with this girl, and Samuel started blasting a song on repeat to piss me off and make her leave.

Did you tell them he played the song to piss you off?

No.

I just said he played the song super loud and we had to stop.

She was recording the interview and it wasn't possible anymore.

I need you to be precise.

Tell me everything exactly the way you told them.

Yes.

So. I told them that

I put an end to the interview.

And that she left.

And I went upstairs to my bedroom and that's when I saw Daniel go out for a walk.

He wasn't at school?

No, he only goes two days a week in Grenoble.

How old is he now?

He's eleven.

And then...

So, after the girl left...

Samuel came down to see me in my bedroom.

We spoke a bit about what we were going to do that day.

It was nothing special, really.

He...

He went back upstairs to work in the attic and I worked in bed.

You wrote? On your computer?

Yes, I finished a translation.

I translate for some German weeklies, for extra money.

And then...

Yes. I heard him working upstairs and playing his music for about, I think it must've been ten minutes.

Then I put some earplugs in because I wanted to take a nap.

And..

I fell asleep.

And an hour later, I think,

I heard Daniel scream, and then...

An earplug must've fallen out, because it woke me up.

The music was still on,

I ran downstairs, and...

Yes. That's it.

I called the SAMU and they arrived 30 minutes later.

- Can I take a look around?

- Of course.

- Yes?

- Yes.

Where do you want to start?

Should I explain... something.

Yeah, maybe.

Yeah. This is where...

This is where we eat.

- Yes, sorry...

- No...

So...

He was working over there?

Yeah, he was insulating the attic.

And when you were having a nap, he was right above you?

- Yes.

- OK.

So...

He was supposed to get to that next.

We wanted to make rooms for B&B.

So, he was working there?

These days, yes.

And the window, when the ambulance arrived, was it open?

Yes, it was.

He used to keep it open?

I'm not sure of that really, because sometimes he would air the room to get rid of the wood dust.

Was he reckless?

Did he ever take risks while working?

No, he was cautious and meticulous, he worked slowly.

Is there any reason why he would've leaned out the window, for instance, to call out to you or Daniel?

No, when he was working, especially when he was playing his music, he kinda... he shut himself off from the world.

So, he never called for me or Daniel up here.

Anyway, with the height of the...

Windowsill?

- Windowsill.

- Yeah.

Had he been drinking?

No, never during the day.

Especially when he was working.

Sweetie...

Come wash up and get dressed.

It's daytime, you need to get up.

Honey, I know this is hard.

It's hard for me too.

And it's going to be hard for a while.

But we have to try and do the things that we did before...

Monica came to see you, she made you Tiramisu.

You can't spend all day without going outside.

It's beautiful out.

And Snoop needs to go out too.

Daniel, will you come eat with us?

I want to sleep.

OK, first eat with us, then you can sleep.

I don't understand.

No one understands.

We can't understand.

I have to understand.

Remember the psychic

I told you about, the one I saw when Alain died?

Monica.

I'd like to.

I'd rather you don't...

He helped me a lot.

But he's a child.

Don't confuse things.

I'll discuss it with Monica.

She's helped children before.

Want some?

What do you need?

Nothing, I'm OK.

OK.

Your doubts aside, it might help him.

She senses things we can't.

Vincent, an old lawyer friend,

Monica, Daniel's Godmother.

- Hello.

- Hello.

- I'll call you.

- Tell me if he eats.

Yes.

Plates?

I'm so tired of crying.

It's really ridiculous,

I'm so exhausted.

- Want Parmesan?

- Yes, it's perfect.

- I don't know where the pepper is.

- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

So, as you know, the autopsy report is inconclusive about the cause of death.

The forensic pathologist didn't have enough concrete elements.

But...

What we can defend, is a fall from the attic window, with him... bouncing off the shed roof.

His head may have hit the edge somewhere around here.

You see?

Then he would have landed on the ground, approximately here.

It seems that he found the strength to crawl one meter or two before collapsing in this final position.

That explains the blood on the snow.

But there are several problems.

First, they found nothing on the roof, no DNA.

And there's these 3 blood spatters here on the wall.

It seems it doesn't really match with the head impact on the roof.

The judge has asked an expert to clarify this.

When you see this what do you think?

I don't know,

I'm not a spatter analyst.

But I know a very good one.

I'm going to get her opinion.

There's one last problem for us, that bruise on your arm.

It might look like the result of a fight or struggle.

When did they see it?

They examined me that night, my sleeve was rolled up.

You explained it to them right away?

I knew how it happened.

Shall I show you?

Yes, please.

Here in the kitchen,

I bang my arm on this all the time.

Like, when I move.

It's ridiculous, it happened several times that week.

I told them my skin marks easily and they can ask Daniel.

He hears me bumping into it.

OK. Good.

So. As you can see, an accidental fall will be hard to defend, given the height of the windowsill.

So that's why there's an investigation for... more suspects.

And you're... more "Suspicious death".

You're an assisted witness because you were the only person there.

OK.

And of course, you're his wife.

Now, looking for a stranger who walks in, kills him while you were sleeping and Daniel was out for a walk is a shitty strategy.

Samuel had no enemies.

Stop!

I did not kill him.

That's not the point.

Really.

We have to go through

Samuel's personality.

What was he was going through?

Is there anything that would seem consistent with suicide?

I thought about it, obviously.

I just can't imagine him jumping with Daniel so close by.

I just can't get it in my head.

Yeah, but it's probably our best defense.

I mean, if they indict you, it's our only defense.

But I think he fell.

Nobody's going to believe that.

I don't believe that.

I need a smoke.

Vincent.

There's something

I want to tell you.

About six months ago,

I wonder if...

Samuel didn't swallow some pills.

I found him passed out drunk on the floor.

He'd vomited.

It was very early in the morning.

There were some white spots in the vomit, and I remember wondering if they were pills.

- Really?

- Yes.

﻿Did you two talk about it?

No, he didn't want to talk about it.

﻿Did Daniel see this?

No.

﻿And you didn't call a doctor?

No, I didn't realize it back then, but looking back at it now, it seems like it might have been a suicide attempt.

﻿Does anyone know about this?

No.

OK. I'll call you back.

Yes.

- OK.

- Bye.

Is the light too bright?

Want me to lower the blinds?

I'm OK.

Yeah?

OK.

You didn't tell me about your parents' arguments.

What do you mean?

I don't really remember any.

When they start yelling,

I prefer to leave.

Can you tell me who was angrier?

No.

Is that why you left the day your dad died?

No, I just felt like a walk.

OK. You say you heard your parents when you left?

Do you remember the conversation?

More or less. It wasn't a fight.

I couldn't hear the words, but it wasn't...

Then you don't know it was a fight.

I could tell...

I could hear it wasn't a fight.

Daniel, the music was loud, you were outside.

They were in her bedroom, two floors up.

How can you be sure?

I wonder if you could hear them at all.

I was just below the open window.

I know what I heard.

OK.

Is it over?

How can you be so sure where you were?

Because I touched the..

Gaffer tape on the woodshed.

Gaffer tape?

When we moved in,

Dad put tape with different textures everywhere,

- so I could feel my way.

- Yes.

I don't really need them now, but I still touch them.

Each piece feels different,

I wouldn't get it wrong.

I touched the woodshed tape.

So I was under the window.

OK.

I transposed what you told me.

But I didn't say it in French.

The volume is what matters here, and French is easier for everyone.

Helene, start the music.

Did it go well?

Yes, nothing special.

What's next this afternoon?

I don't know, I'm tired.

I need to work, then I'll rest.

Not asking me?

I assume you'll keep working in the attic?

Stop the music.

Stop.

So?

Did you hear anything?

Let's go again, louder this time.

Louder? But I didn't shout at all.

The point of the reenactment is to determine a credible volume.

Vincent, I never shouted.

She spoke no louder.

Her son says the voices were calm.

That doesn't hold up.

The music drowns them out.

My client didn't shout.

She won't shout now.

Miss, please replace Mrs Voyter.

Come on in, please.

Play the music.

Start the music!

Did it go well?

Yes, nothing special.

What's next this afternoon?

I don't know, I'm tired.

I need to work, then I'll rest.

Go again, much louder.

Was it good?

Yes, nothing special.

What's next this afternoon?

I don't know, I'm tired.

I need to work, then I'll rest.

Not asking me?

I assume you'll keep working in the attic?

Stop the music.

Now they hear it.

Good.

You do realize that was ridiculous?

Spare me your comments.

It was calm voices, not like that.

But see, you wouldn't have heard them.

Right?

Can we try one last time, starting inside?

With calm voices again.

We can.

I made a mistake.

Cut the music.

This is the tape I touched.

I was inside.

I got mixed up.

That's not what you told us.

Zoé Solidor saw you leave the house after she left.

And your mom says she spoke to your dad after that.

I got mixed up.

You got mixed up.

Well.

This afternoon was hard, wasn't it?

I'm mad at myself.

I thought I was sure, and then...

But you didn't lie, did you?

I don't want you to change your memories.

You have to tell them exactly like you remember it.

That can never hurt me.

Give me your hand.

Yes.

What do we do now?

You want a drink?

Whiskey?

Come.

Sorry.

All I can say is, the interrogation is in progress and may continue for a while.

She's been in there for 8 hours.

Is she in trouble?

Sandra Voyter is not in trouble.

She maintains her innocence, so there will be no confession.

You're confident, but we've heard about a recording.

Is it incriminating?

You're not listening.

She has not been indicted, so nothing is incriminating.

The so-called video is a myth so far.

We've had no access to it.

So, you confirm it's a video?

No, I confirm nothing.

I said precisely the opposite.

If there's nothing new, why the summons?

I don't know what to tell you.

We don't understand it ourselves.

Thank you.

Thank you for coming for the public prosecutor's statement.

So, Sandra Voyter was indicted this morning at 8:30 a.m.

The investigation revealed elements that justify this decision.

Three elements in particular.

Analysis of Mr. Maleski's blood spatter found at the couple's domicile indicate he may have received a blunt force blow to the head when he was on the third-floor balcony.

In addition, the reenactment done three days ago brought to light a number of discrepancies.

Lastly, a file was discovered on a USB key belonging to Mr. Maleski.

All I can say about it, for now, is that it's an audio recording of the couple, made the day before his death.

As I'm trying to tell you, she can't come sign herself because she's held up at the courthouse.

So it'll be me, her lawyer Vincent Renzi, coming to get the documents for her.

No, I can't come at 11.

I can be there in 20 minutes?

OK. Thanks, be right there.

We have good news.

The judge this afternoon is not Da Silva, it's Bollène.

OK.

I'm off to the bank.

And the home equity loan?

Less than we hoped.

They have money problems.

Outstanding credit, etc.

The bank will only do 50,000.

Bail will be more than that.

Her son is a witness.

He'll be testifying in court.

There is obviously a risk of her exerting pressure on him.

As a consequence, release on bail is not an option.

I'm asking you to place Mrs Voyter in detention pending trial.

Thank you.

Over to you, Mrs Boudaoud.

Judge, how can we consider her a flight risk, when she's responsible for her son?

That makes no sense.

With a visually impaired child?

And she's all over the media.

Separating them could compound his trauma.

He had an accident at the age of four that damaged his sight.

He's been traumatized, both psychologically and emotionally.

Mrs Boudaoud, your reaction?

The judge's decision is rare enough to merit praise.

A judge refusing to give in to repressive reflexes is a healthy sign, especially in such a case.

We feel the release under judicial supervision underscores the weakness of the case.

Is your client relieved?

This is a rare decision in a homicide accusation, and reads like a repudiation of Judge Janvier.

Reactions in the hallways have been intense.

I quote,

"This decision is dangerous."

"The suspect will be reunited with a major witness."

"It's a real concern for the upcoming trial."

How could you not tell me about it?

I had no idea he recorded it.

Even if he hadn't...

You had a fight the day before he died.

That recording is not reality.

It's a part of it, maybe, if you have an extreme moment, an emotional peak you focus on, of course it crushes everything.

It may seem like irrefutable proof, but actually warps everything.

It's not reality. It's our voices, but it's not who we are.

I don't give a fuck about what is reality. OK.

You need to start seeing yourself the way others are going to perceive you.

The trial is not about the truth.

- I didn't know there'd be a trial.

- Well, there is.

Now, what really counts is... who you have around you.

There's nobody around me.

Yes, there's Daniel.

Daniel is important.

And didn't you and Samuel have... any friends?

We should never have come here.

I was so happy in London.

It was him, he insisted.

He said there'd be no more distractions from work.

It would solve our financial problems.

I left my shithole in Germany and ended up stuck in his shithole.

It's fucking absurd, isn't it? Come on!

- Hello.

- Hello.

Hi, kitten.

This is Mrs Berger, appointed by the Justice Minister.

Hello.

Vincent Renzi, I work with Nour.

She'll be here regularly, with...

Daniel, and with you.

The frequency will be specified.

She's here... to ensure that everything goes well.

And that no one tries to influence Daniel, or make him say things he doesn't want to say at the trial.

The judge says you must speak French in her presence.

Right.

That's it.

May I speak with Daniel in private?

OK, shall we go?

I'll call you.

Your mother will give us space to get acquainted.

My name is Marge.

We'll see each other a lot.

Do you know why I'm here?

Are you OK with it?

You can consider me a friend.

Or not. That's your choice.

What do you think?

It's OK, I don't...

I don't need us to be friends.

Well, I'm here to protect your testimony.

The law sent me, and... the law can't be someone's friend.

Otherwise it couldn't be someone else's friend, and the law must be the same for everyone.

So you're right,

I can't be your friend.

You just have to tell me if anything feels strange, if there's a problem,

I don't know, for example with your mom, regarding the trial.

I usually discuss stuff like that with my friends.

Right.

Maybe this time you don't really have a choice.

With chocolate chips... and raspberries...

I know it doesn't exist but that's what I vow.

The archduchess's socks...

What?

The archduchess's socks...

He was one of the only persons I knew, when he walked into a room, something shifted, the atmosphere changed.

And I suppose that's charm, isn't it?

I fell in love with his charm.

I spend my whole life not understanding family and friends.

And then he came along, and I felt like...

I understood what he was saying, the signals he was sending me.

We didn't necessarily agree, but we had...

We had things to tell each other.

I realized that later, when it was gone.

Don't say it's gone.

Just focus on him.

How you met.

When we met, he'd just gotten a job at a university in London.

So... we moved there together.

He was a great teacher.

He had a way of making everything sound alive and accessible, it was great.

But some...

But that wasn't really enough, so...

Deep down, what he really wanted to do was to write.

He was working on a novel for years.

I watched him struggle, it was hard.

And I came to realize his relationship with time, with work, was... complicated, unlike for me...

No, stop comparing yourself to him.

Just to...

Go back to your relationship.

Our relationship revolved around intellectual stimulation, even if it meant neglecting everything else.

Everything else?

Meaning Daniel?

We should mention Daniel early on.

The accident.

OK. I didn't know it was so...

- It's OK?

- It's OK.

It's just that I didn't know that it was so... like this, OK.

Everything changed after the accident.

Daniel was four.

That day, Samuel was supposed to pick him up from school.

But he was on a roll with his writing, so... he called a babysitter last minute, and she showed up late.

As they were crossing the street, a motorcycle hit Daniel.

His optic nerve was permanently damaged.

After that,

Samuel became obsessive about it, he blamed himself on a loop.

If only he'd gone, picked him up in time...

He was overcome with guilt.

Perhaps he never truly escaped that feeling.

We spent that whole year at the hospital, with Daniel.

We began having financial problems and Samuel started taking antidepressants.

Can we please keep that clean,

Vincent?

I'd really like to protect him and his image, and spare Daniel.

We'll try.

OK.

But it will be like that,

I have to...

I have to admit things.

You have to prepare yourself to tell everything, and the challenge is to do it in French.

OK.

One year later.

Are you really interested in...

What interests you?

Come on, sure.

I never see anybody,

I work here all day long, you come to see me, of course you interest me.

I run.

It's one of my favorite things to do.

Makes me feel high, like I'm on drugs.

What do you know about drugs?

That's the next question.

Big subject.

Maybe don't write everything down.

No surely not.

I told you, we should have done this in Grenoble.

It's fine.

I'll write your answers down.

Do you confirm this is your interview with Mrs Voyter?

Yes.

She refuses to talk about herself, yet that's why you came.

I came to talk about her work.

Right, but by constantly changing the subject, what was she looking for, do you suppose?

We can hear it.

She asks about me.

She seemed to enjoy talking about me more than herself.

Was she inciting you to talk about yourself?

Inciting...

No, I wouldn't say that.

She wasn't manipulative, just relaxed.

It felt natural.

She seemed to enjoy the conversation.

You say "relaxed".

We hear her serve you wine at 1:45.

Had she been drinking before you arrived?

I think so.

Would you say she did her utmost to make you comfortable, more than you might've expected when interviewing a writer?

I wouldn't say that, no.

It seemed like Sandra... Mrs Voyter, needed to escape, to relax.

- Escape?

- Right.

Did you know that Sandra, as you call her, was bisexual?

No.

Did you sense it?

No.

Hearing the conversation now, with hindsight, would you call it seduction?

I felt, and she told me herself, that she didn't have much of a social life or many chances to talk to new people.

I suppose you could call that a form of seduction.

The court needs to know if you would call it that.

Seduction means several things.

But the word seduction always implies some... seduction.

The witness's answer is clear enough, as to what she means by seduction.

Mrs Voyter kept expressing her interest in you.

She wanted to do the interview in Grenoble.

Didn't you sense...

She answered that question.

Not very clearly.

Please answer, Miss Solidor.

Could you call me Mrs?

I dislike being reduced to a marital status.

Of course.

That wasn't my intention.

I didn't feel seduced in the moment.

So you did wonder afterwards?

I found it atypical, nothing more.

How did you interpret the song

Samuel Maleski played?

I felt tension around the noise.

Samuel Maleski imposing his presence without showing himself.

And Sandra's reaction...

What was her reaction?

She was a bit annoyed.

And when the song started over?

He was playing it on a loop.

Clearly... good deduction.

But how did it feel to you in the moment?

It added to the strangeness.

I felt my presence was less...

It was less relaxed.

So you clearly felt tension.

- You're nitpicking.

- No, just clarifying.

Did you feel tension?

Yes.

Did you feel that Mr. Maleski, by playing that music, wanted to disrupt, or interrupt, your interview?

That was my first thought, yes.

But it's hard to read the intentions of someone you can't see.

That's what they pay me for!

Sandra Voyter, you sought a connection to divert the interview.

Correct?

That's a leading question.

There was no seduction.

My question concerns your connection.

In the recording you're chummy, laughing, drinking wine.

Were you seeking escape from a difficult home-life by connecting with this young woman?

Mrs Voyter did not initiate the meeting.

Please answer, Mrs Voyter.

Yes, I found her surprising.

I hadn't seen anyone new in a while.

And yes, I needed a drink.

This person was intelligent and nice, nothing more.

That interview was hardly enough to base a thesis on!

She can have a laugh with a student whose questions don't thrill her.

Would you say the music

Mr. Maleski played so aggressively indicated he was jealous of you, or Miss... Mrs Solidor? Sorry.

The music was a cover of 50 Cent's P.I.M.P., a deeply misogynistic song.

It was an instrumental version.

Answer, please.

Could your husband's song choice express his jealousy?

I can answer.

He often played that song.

I doubt it was intentional.

He loved loud music, it relaxed him.

He had purposefully installed...

What is a "speaker"? Sorry.

A powerful speaker... sorry.

He worked a lot, it was noisy...

Mrs Solidor says you ended the interview over that.

- Is that true?

- She never said that.

If the defense keeps reacting to every question,

I'll be very irritated.

Mrs Voyter, answer the question.

The music was just very loud.

And when it started over,

I realized it wasn't going to stop.

That made discussion difficult.

So I...

I preferred to stop.

And I was tired, yes.

And I felt a bit... woozy, from the wine.

Yet once alone, you didn't ask him to explain his behavior?

As I said, it was habitual.

No.

You entertaining an attractive young woman while he toiled upstairs was neither habitual, nor neutral.

He knew you liked women.

You'd recently cheated.

That's beside the point.

And sexist.

I'd have said the same if she were an attractive man.

Excuse me, but this couple's conflicts matter here.

There's something a bit strange in this situation.

You say you went upstairs to your room to work and sleep.

Right below the attic with the deafening music.

Music that had made the interview impossible.

In that big house, you chose that spot?

Yes, that's where I work.

I always work in bed.

When Samuel came to talk to you, you didn't complain?

Deafening music overhead is hardly normal.

I'm used to it, I don't mind.

I wanted to work, I had my earplugs.

It was normal.

I can work in any situation.

You said you were tired, woozy from the wine.

Yet you wanted to work?

Yes.

And I did. Not for long.

A translation was due.

I wanted to finish it before resting.

As I said, I can work in any environment, any condition.

Apparently you can also rest anywhere, anytime.

So all was well with the world.

That's all.

No further questions.

Daniel, that's not what you told us.

Zoe Solidor saw you leave the house after she left.

And your mom says she spoke to your dad after that.

I got mixed up.

You got mixed up.

Indeed there is a problem, Daniel.

Right?

You couldn't be two places at once.

I think I went back inside.

What bothers me is how sure you were before the reenactment.

You said in your statement:

"Each piece of tape feels different."

"I wouldn't get it wrong."

And:

"I was just below the open window."

"I know what I heard."

Then, during the reenactment, you said something else entirely.

How come?

I thought

I remembered where I was, but...

Maybe the shock of what happened next got me mixed up.

A psychiatrist who met with Daniel says emotional shock may have altered some memories.

Of course.

Do you remember now why you came back inside?

I think I must've forgotten... my gloves or my phone.

But you're not sure?

I don't remember exactly.

So, you went from absolute certainty to uncertainty about your memories of that day.

This is very problematic.

You're fixating on one detail in his memory to cast doubt on his whole memory.

What do you want us to believe?

That shock may have turned yelling into calm voices?

You insinuate he lied to protect his mother.

No.

I'm merely signaling the witness's doubts.

But we are entitled to wonder.

Daniel Maleski says he would leave when his parents fought.

Whereas on that day, he happens to go out right when an argument is likely to erupt.

Thus, he doesn't hear a thing.

I didn't happen to go out.

I fled the music.

And he's very precise about what he heard.

He's never budged on that.

The psychiatrist and visual impairment expert both observed

Daniel's excellent aural memory.

Clerk, please display the elements provided by Mr. Balard.

We're listening.

The decisive element here is the three blood spatters on the woodshed, as indicated on the sketch.

Can we zoom in on the woodshed?

Their shape is typical of spatter projected from high above.

They are long and narrow.

The longest measures 4 centimeters, which is a lot.

So, according to our tests, these spatters could only have landed here if Mr. Maleski was struck on the head while on the 3rd floor balcony.

He would have to have been leaning over the balcony, his head already quite far out when the blow was struck, for the spatter to land there.

No other explanation stands.

Did the violence of the blow make Mr. Maleski fall?

Most likely, it was the combination of a violent blow and a deliberate push.

Would you say the aggressor was in a state of extreme anger, to provoke a fall after administering such a violent blow?

A state of rage, I'd say.

Hard to imagine anything less.

Such states can increase physical strength.

The guardrail is 1.2 meters high.

Comes up to about here.

Mr. Maleski was 1.82 meters tall and weighed 85 kilos.

So, pushing him over that guardrail would have required a very deliberate push, right?

The entire act was very deliberate.

Such a blow is always intentional.

What I mean by very deliberate is... very coordinated. Methodical.

Based on his weight, we can assume it was necessary to lift his legs to make him fall, which hardly suggests rage.

Rage does not exclude will.

And Mr. Maleski was probably already off-balance.

He may have fallen as much from the blow as from his own unstable position.

As I said, we have no material elements...

Except those 3 drops of blood.

Everything else must be speculated to explain those drops, right?

OK, but the only explanation is the one I gave.

You gave us a theory, not an explanation.

Actually, two theories.

With and without a deliberate push.

According to your theories, what type of object was used?

A heavy object, probably in metal or dense wood, and undoubtedly with a sharp edge.

Did you examine any such objects found on the premises?

You know no weapon was found.

They're easily disposed of.

No further questions.

Two possible explanations for these 3 spatters.

Either they came from here, after a violent blow.

Or they resulted when the skull hit this roof ledge, approximately here.

The first hypothesis is unlikely.

It's inconsistent with the shape and movement of the spatters.

Focusing on the second hypothesis, we must take into account the bounce caused by the impact on the roof ledge.

I'll show you a video of our in-situ tests.

There.

As you can see in our reenactment with a dummy, such an impact causes the body to turn abruptly.

And during that rollover, or spin, a fraction of a second after impact, these 3 spatters are projected onto this surface.

The only valid explanation is that Mr. Maleski fell from the attic window.

I believe it's the only way he could've bounced off the roof, and sustained such an injury.

You use the cautious qualifier

"I believe".

So it's your opinion.

How do you explain the lack of DNA or trace tissue at the point of impact, or "bounce" as you call it?

I'll show you.

This is a test we carried out under comparable conditions.

At the time of the incident, there was a layer of ice underneath a thick layer of snow.

We see the snow melting in acceleration.

And we can see, during 1 hour and 50 minutes, that the runoff takes with it all residue embedded at the point of impact.

It ends up with the blood that was already down here.

You call the violent blow hypothesis

"improbable".

Would you call it impossible?

No, but highly improbable.

Meaning it is possible.

As it's possible

I'll be president someday.

I know the definition.

It's improbable for a reason.

In your hypothesis, in order to explain the angle of these 3 spatters, we have to imagine that Mr. Maleski's head was leaning way out, around 80 cm past the guardrail.

This implies the aggressor forced him to lean backwards over the void, shoving him against the guardrail, his entire torso pitched backwards.

The aggressor would have to be leaning very far out while holding a heavy object and striking the victim with powerful momentum.

All these elements, in addition to the defendant's body mass, make this hypothesis highly improbable.

But not impossible.

Listen Daniel,

I asked to see you because...

I know you have a vested interest in this case.

I've allowed you to attend the trial so far.

But tomorrow will be far more complicated.

We'll be covering some disturbing details, so I've decided you won't be attending.

I think I can hear anything.

What?

I think I can hear anything.

- Yeah?

- I'm prepared.

You can hear it, but can you handle it?

We have a job to do.

We need to be able to work... with serenity.

I've never disrupted the trial.

Disrupted...

That's not the point.

We need to be able to evoke the facts bluntly.

We have to address everything, without fear of hurting you.

I've already been hurt.

And that's why I need... to hear, so I can get past it.

The trial is not about you hearing.

It's about establishing the truth, without being forced to censor ourselves.

When has anyone censored themselves?

Even if you forbid me to come,

I'll find out.

I'll know what happened from TV, radio, internet.

I'll be obsessed.

Mrs Voyter, you claim your husband attempted suicide

6 months before he died.

You remembered late, which is quite surprising.

Can you describe the episode in detail?

Yes.

It happened a few weeks after he stopped his medication.

I found him lying on the floor... early in the morning, in his room.

He'd... had a lot to drink..

The night before, and passed out.

He'd vomited, and in the vomit, I saw aspirin.

The pills had nearly dissolved.

At first I didn't understand what it was.

But later, I found... empty blister packs in the kitchen garbage.

I cleaned it all up and put him in bed.

Later, when he felt better, he didn't want to discuss it.

He just said he'd stopped his meds too soon.

You had separate bedrooms?

It was his office, and he usually slept there, yes.

I see. What made you go into his room so early?

I wake up very early.

He did too, sometimes.

We occasionally spent that time together, talking.

At 6 in the morning?

Yes, if I saw the light on. Yes.

We'd stopped sharing a bed, but we were very close.

I would often... finish the night with him, in the office bed.

I'd gone down to make coffee.

I saw his door was ajar, and...

I saw him lying on the floor.

No one else witnessed that?

No.

Thank you, you may sit down.

Did you know that?

Which antidepressant did you prescribe?

Escitalopram, 20 mg per day.

- Was it his choice to stop?

- Yes.

About 7 months before he died he wanted to wean off.

I recommended a tapering plan with weekly check-ins.

Any suicidal ideation?

No, Samuel wasn't depressive.

I'd prescribed Escitalopram as an emotional shield to help him cope after his son's accident.

Can sudden withdrawal from a low dose trigger a suicide attempt?

Anything's possible in theory, but why would he have asked me to help him wean off, then stop behind my back?

Makes no sense.

And no mention of it in our weekly sessions?

Have you ever had a patient commit suicide, or attempt suicide?

In French, "committing suicide" means both trying and succeeding.

It's the action.

Thanks for the language lesson.

No patient has committed suicide.

Aside from Mr. Maleski, since we're here to rule on the question.

In any case, we can't consider you an expert on suicide, failed or successful.

You said your husband refused to discuss it with you, or anyone else, apparently.

Why, do you think?

Because he was ashamed.

He had a lot of...

It's too complicated.

Can I change the language, please?

Thanks.

Yeah, I think because he was ashamed.

Samuel had a lot of issues with shame.

It's complicated.

He was frustrated with teaching.

It had become a burden, and he wanted to write.

He'd been working on a novel for years, before and after Daniel's accident.

I read everything he wrote.

I thought it was really good and I told him so.

But from one day to another, he just... couldn't do it anymore, he just stopped.

It made him feel like a coward.

He would belittle himself.

He ended up convincing himself he could not write because of his dependency on the medication.

He wanted to free himself of that, and he could not, of course not...

I'm sorry, I'm not finished.

He could not talk about the suicide attempt because his feelings of failure were just too painful.

He never spoke of that.

Not once.

He blamed you for getting him hooked on the pills from the first session.

It drove him mad.

He and I decided together.

You can't deny you're at the center of this equation.

Samuel came to see me because he felt guilty, but mostly because you blamed him.

He described your behavior as quite castrating.

You made him pay for the accident by forcing him to give up what mattered most to him:

Writing.

You put him on an emotional roller coaster.

On the one hand, it's true, you encouraged him to write, wanted him to succeed.

But if he had, it would've been unbearable for you.

That's the problem.

It may have been subconscious.

All the material and psychological burdens resulting from the accident were his to bear.

It's as though you said,

"This is your problem."

"You're responsible. Deal with it."

"I want to free myself from that, to write."

Material burdens were managed by Mrs Voyter as much as her husband.

We have their bank statements, receipts, etc.

I'm also talking about the emotional load.

Responsibilities, sense of purpose, anxiety.

In those areas,

Samuel felt an unbearable imbalance.

So what your patients tell you is the truth?

As a psychoanalyst, you never wondered whether Samuel Maleski might've needed to imagine an unbearable imbalance to prevent himself from writing?

After a while, I can tell what's real and what isn't.

Lucky you.

I'm sorry to interrupt.

But...

I don't know. You come here,

OK, with maybe your opinion, and you tell me who Samuel was and what we were going through.

But what you say is just a little part of the whole situation.

You know.

I mean, sometimes, sometimes a couple... is kind of a chaos and everybody is lost.

Sometimes we fight together and sometimes we fight alone, and sometimes we fight against each other, that happens.

And I think it's possible that Samuel needed to see things the way you describe them, but...

If I'd been seeing a therapist, he could stand here too and say very ugly things about Samuel.

But would those things be true?

Did you resent your husband after your son's accident?

We were both dealing with very different emotions at that time.

Yes or no?

Yes, for a few days.

Daniel was on his watch.

Your son practically lost his sight, and you only resented him for a few days?

Yes, about his responsibility for the accident. Yes.

Of course.

I mean, maybe. The doctor earlier said something about a tragic situation.

I immediately refused to see it that way.

I never saw Daniel as handicapped.

You know, I wanted to protect him from that perception.

Because, as soon as you mark a child that way, you condemn him to now to not see his life as his own, whereas he should feel that it's his best life because it's the only life he's got, it is his own.

He reads books, he goes on social media like any other kid he plays the piano, he dreams, he cries, he laughs.

He's a very lively kid.

He's OK.

Yeah.

So perhaps, I...

I resented Samuel for projecting his own pain onto Daniel, yes.

Thank you.

I want to drink all night.

Yeah, same.

I will drink.

To forget.

Come on. You're the only lawyer...

OK, once again.

No, you're really the only lawyer I know.

Is it a great reason for putting your life in someone's hands?

- Is it?

- No, but you're good too.

Right? You're good.

- I don't know.

- Oh, come on.

You look like a dog.

Excuse me?

No, a beautiful dog.

How do you say it?

A basset?

Funny you say that.

I can't trust someone if I can't put an animal's head on them.

Really? So what am I?

I'm not sure yet.

After all this time, you still don't know?

OK.

Do you remember me from before, when we first met?

Yes I do, of course.

I don't. What was I like?

You were a little bit lost, as I can remember.

Lonely.

And..

Ambitious.

And I was hopelessly in love.

I can't remember a thing.

OK.

But I'm innocent.

You know that, right?

Yes.

I mean really.

I don't know what you're thinking.

I think a lot of things

I don't tell you.

Otherwise you'd fire me right now.

No, Vincent.

In your head, you're thinking...

Sometimes when you look at me, just like right now,

I can feel that you're judging me.

I don't know what you think.

Sandra, I believe you.

I'm not judging you.

My love,

I just want you to know...

I'm not...

I'm not that monster, you know?

Everything you hear in the trial, it's just...

It's twisted. You know.

And...

It wasn't like that.

Your father...

Your father was my soulmate.

We chose each other, and I loved him.

But how do you prove that?

I just wish you would be shielded from all this, that you could do... that you could do children's stuff, that you could be a child just a little longer. You know.

All rise!

You may be seated.

We'll begin by calling the

Chief Investigator to the bar.

He insists, it's important.

You may be seated.

The Chief Investigator has surely arrived, so we'll start with him.

Clerk, please cue Exhibit 31.

Bailiff, prepare to hand out the transcription of the recording to the jurors.

Clerk?

What can I do?

It's part of the job.

Organize yourself differently.

I'm not going to cancel.

How can I organize on my own?

You know we have to plan things together.

I won't leave Daniel alone because you're gone.

Leave him with Monica, what's the big deal?

Three days a week?

We'd have to pay her for that.

We can't afford it.

I need time.

Not just a few hours.

I'm talking about blocking out time for myself for the whole year.

This isn't working for me anymore.

Organize your time differently, it's up to you.

When's the last time you helped him do his homework?

So many things you don't care about.

That's the time I mean.

Darling, the book just came out.

You know it's just this time.

It's always "just this time".

Whether you have a book out, or you're writing, or you need space to figure out what to write.

I've been following your lead for years!

I can't do anything with my time.

Do you understand?

It's not my time, it's yours!

Do I force you to teach?

Do I force you to homeschool Daniel?

No one's forcing you.

If you want more time,

I've never stopped you.

Are you fucking serious?

I cut my course load in half to gain more time and it's still not enough.

I have to finish the renovation, and I'm dealing with everything else!

Why do you refuse to talk about it?

Why can't you just admit it has to do with how things are divided between us?

Because you're wrong.

I don't owe you any time.

I do my part.

Come on, let's not take inventory here, please.

Let's relax.

I love you.

When you decided to homeschool Daniel,

I told you be careful.

It's a beautiful, generous choice.

I thank you for it, but you don't have to.

I told you it would force you...

What?

To spend more time with my son?

I'm glad I did.

I wouldn't have the relationship

I have with him today if I didn't.

The relationship

I don't have with him, you mean?

I didn't say that, no.

I'm saying maybe, just maybe, things are a little out of balance between us.

I want you to look at that.

Why is this so hard to discuss?

I don't believe in the notion of reciprocity in a couple.

It's naïve and frankly, depressing.

Yes. And I think discussing it is a waste of time, considering the state you're in. Seriously.

All this blah-blah-blah, and more time is gone.

All this time spent chitchatting could be spent in silence doing whatever you want to do, if only you knew.

I want time to start writing, same as you.

Do it.

Writers don't stop writing because they have a son and chores.

Stop whining about your scheduling bullshit and stop blaming me for what you did or didn't do.

I live with you.

I plan my life around you.

If I imposed on you what you're imposing on me, neither of us would be able to write.

Don't worry about me,

I always manage to write.

Great.

Perfect.

If you're so sure of yourself, adapt.

I do adapt.

I take Daniel to school.

- Once a week.

- We have Monica on Tuesdays, come on.

Sandra, don't be dishonest.

- I'm not. You're the one nitpicking.

- I've given you too much.

Too much time, too many concessions.

I want this time back.

And you owe it to me. Be fair!

I'm sorry, but no.

Are you insane?

I don't owe you anything.

Really.

This is about your relationship with your son.

And to protect yourself and your comfort, because you got scared and put yourself in that position.

It was your choice to come here and start this renovation.

This is your own trap!

I don't take your time, you waste it all on your own!

I want things to change now.

I want time to start writing again.

Great, go for it.

If you want my advice, go back to the one you ditched.

That's your advice?

Go back to the book you plundered?

So now it's plundering.

We've discussed it.

You'd given up.

You took the book's best idea.

How am I supposed to go back to it?

Do you realize how cynical that is of you?

Publish your own version, say it inspired me,

I'll admit to it.

If something needs to be written, someone has to write it. You know.

You have animal vision.

You pretend to be obliging, but...

Look at you.

Even your bullshit moralizing...

And this, really, is a way for you to waste more time.

You should be flattered that I was inspired by you.

This is life, things circulate.

Yes.

And frankly, I wish you'd be inspired to plunder me.

You're not alone in your jungle, but you impose everything.

You impose your rhythm, your use of time, even your language.

Even with language,

I meet you on your turf.

We speak English at home.

I'm not on my turf,

I don't speak my mother tongue.

Nor mine, though we live here.

Yes, it's a middle ground, in fact.

Because I'm not French, you're not German.

We create a middle ground, so nobody has to go to the other's turf.

This is what English is for.

Don't blame me for that.

But we live in France.

That's our reality.

Daniel hears you speak a language that has nothing to do wife, his life, just because you impose it on him, like everything else.

We're on your turf, all the time.

Your country!

Every single day I have to accept that we live in your hometown!

The people you grew up with look down on me whenever I don't make the effort to smile at them.

You don't think me living here counts as meeting you on your turf?

You never smile at anyone.

That's why you love me, right?

Because, if you wanted a stupid bitch who grins at your friends, you'd have picked someone else.

You really have no shame.

That's a superpower.

You see no one but yourself.

I see you very clearly, just not as a victim.

You impose your way of living, speaking, eating, even fucking.

I could never get you to fuck any other way.

Because you expect me to follow your lead, that's your notion of a couple.

I don't believe it;

I don't believe it...

I don't have a notion, I don't give a fuck about couples. Really.

So, you say I'm stopping you from fucking the way you want.

- Seriously?

- Yes.

Who's been refusing to fuck since the accident?

You know I meant before.

What did I ever refuse to do sexually?

Everything.

Everything plus I have to accept that you fuck other people.

I do not fuck other people.

Don't deny it.

Once, and you cling to it in order to suffer!

- You cheated several times.

- You make yourself the victim!

I'm not a victim,

I'm a man who's been cheated on!

Plundered and cheated on.

I can live without sex, but not forever.

So you blame me?

I'm the one frustrating you?

It's not about who's... who's blaming who or who's frustrating who.

The frustration is there and we're both dealing with it.

Me personally

I refuse to rot inside, so I find solutions.

At this point, sex was a question of personal hygiene!

But you impose your solutions, which are solutions for you only.

You don't give a shit if it hurts me and Daniel.

You leave Daniel out of this.

This is not about him.

I do not impose anything on him.

You made us live here among the goats.

You complain about the life you chose!

You're not a victim.

Not at all!

Your generosity conceals something dirtier and meaner.

You're incapable of facing your ambitions and resent me for it.

But I didn't put you where you are.

I've nothing to do with it!

You're not sacrificing yourself, as you say.

You choose to sit on the sidelines because you're afraid!

Your pride makes your head explode before you can even come up with a germ of an idea!

You wake up at 40 needing someone to blame.

You're the one to blame!

You're petrified by your own fucking standards and fear of failure.

This is the truth.

You're smart.

I know you know I'm right.

And Daniel has nothing to do with it.

Stop it!

You're a monster.

Even Daniel says it, with his own words.

Take that back, you piece of shit.

He's told me countless times how hard you are.

He's telling you what you want to hear.

He can feel your guilt and he's trying to reassure you, don't you see that?

You've never stopped feeling guilty about him!

You're cold-hearted.

You have no pity.

And you have way too much for yourself.

I can't stand any more of your fucking ice!

- You're violent!

- Yes, I am!

So...

Can you tell us where you found this recording?

On a USB key belonging to the victim.

He made several dozen recordings on his cellphone.

For 6 months, he'd been recording moments from, his life.

For a literary project, apparently.

Did he transcribe all the recordings?

Yes, except this last argument.

Does your investigation link this argument to his death?

Yes. They occurred 20 hours apart and have common themes.

He criticizes her infidelity.

A pretty girl comes the next day.

A literature student, to interview Sandra Voyter about her books.

There must've been tension in the air.

The two women were enjoying themselves while he worked hard upstairs.

The argument can be seen as a dress rehearsal for the next day.

How do you interpret the violent outbursts?

We hear blows.

A physical altercation, the accused striking her husband.

What makes it possible for you to reach that conclusion?

She seems to be in a more intense state of rage.

- Sorry?

- Speak directly to the court.

She's clearly in a more intense state of rage.

Her shouts at the end of the audio are the last step before the violence gets physical.

The confusion that follows is hard to analyze, but... we hear blows to a body or a face, and the muffled screams we hear are Mr. Maleski's.

You mentioned bruises on Mrs Voyter.

Show Exhibit 9, please.

This photo was taken on the day her husband died.

How did she explain it?

She initially told us she'd bumped into a kitchen counter.

We pointed out that the bruising was around her wrist, and looked a lot like signs of a struggle.

Later, when we played her the recording, she admitted it had happened then, during their brief struggle.

So you admit you lied?

Yes.

Because..

I was afraid that if I mentioned it,

I knew it would make me a suspect and I got scared.

And you didn't know he'd recorded the fight.

So you lied twice.

About the bruises, and by not mentioning the fight.

For me, it was just one lie.

Because, if I'd been honest about the bruises, I'd have mentioned the argument.

I didn't want to be seen as guilty.

As no guilty person ever does.

Can we time the bruises exactly?

The doctor examined her the following day.

It was too late to determine exactly when they occurred.

So it's possible a second fight caused the bruises on the day Mr. Maleski died.

What do we hear at the end of the argument?

The first sound of breaking glass is me throwing a glass against the wall.

A wine glass that was on the table.

After that, I went over to my husband and I slapped him.

That's when he grabbed my wrist, quite violently.

That's the struggling we can hear.

Just after, I tried to stop him from throwing picture frames to the floor but I couldn't, so we hear them shattering.

Aside from that slap, did you hit him?

No.

What we hear next is Samuel repeatedly hitting himself in the face and the head, and then punching the wall.

You can still see the dent.

There are a few around the house, it's not the first time he did that.

Years ago, he already broke a finger punching the wall during an episode.

We have photos of those dents in the wall.

Thank you.

Here.

And the X-ray of his fractured finger, taken in June 2017 at the hospital in Grenoble.

Is it fair to say your depiction of the violence is interpretive and not objective?

She repeatedly lied to us, so believing her...

Thus, this is about believing, or not believing.

It's a subjective opinion, based on an ambiguous recording.

You link the argument of the day of the death.

You call it a "dress rehearsal".

Do you have any direct proof?

The recording is direct proof of a fight.

I mean the day of the death.

With no witnesses or confessions, we must interpret.

In fact, this violent fight is... phantasmal.

It exists only as fantasy.

You float the idea, the prosecutor floats it, over or around the facts, making it omnipresent here in court, but...

We risk turning this fantasy into a reality simply because there was indeed a fight the day before Mr. Maleski died.

Don't substitute the day before for the next day.

We can't fill the blanks with a supposition, simply because we have sounds for one and not the other.

Mrs Voyter, did you know he'd recorded you before you were told?

No, but I knew that he often recorded moments of our lives.

He didn't always let you know?

What were these recordings?

At first, he would mention it.

After a while, he did it without us knowing.

He recorded conversations,

Daniel's piano lessons, and sometimes just himself, talking to himself.

I think he wanted to gather material to help him start writing again.

Now, with hindsight, it seems possible that he could have provoked this fight just to record it.

Wait, are you implying you're the victim of a twisted man?

Seriously?

He recorded her in secret.

It's a valid question.

You forget the situation is perverse.

Now the victim is on trial!

No, but my client has a point.

Can you explain what he means by cheating, and how he found out?

He went through my phone and discovered messages from a woman I'd met at the beginning of that year.

What do you mean by "met"?

It was sexual, we slept together twice.

Twice?

Yes.

On the recording you said once.

It meant with just one person.

Hang on...

Samuel mentions numerous affairs in the past.

It sounds like you cheated constantly.

That's not true.

I had a few flings the year of Daniel's accident.

It wasn't cheating, because Samuel knew.

He found out each time?

No, I told him.

It was a tricky year.

You want us to believe he agreed to it?

I'm not saying that,

I'm saying I was honest about it.

Interesting take on honesty.

But the year he died you quit being honest, why?

Things were different.

I felt that it would hurt him too much at that time.

Because you had feelings for that woman?

No, I felt it would hurt him because he was fragile.

And...

As I said, with her it was just sexual.

The person I had feelings for was Samuel.

Interesting take on feelings.

I'm trying to understand.

At first you agreed on an open relationship, then that changed?

I don't even know what that means, I'm sorry.

Sorry. No, we never had that kind of agreement.

After the accident, we were both trying to feel better.

I needed that to keep it together, and I was honest.

But then you quit being honest, and he held you accountable.

He doesn't sound "fragile".

- Do you admit he was jealous?

- Yes.

OK. Had he become obsessed?

No. I don't know...

He was hurt, that's true.

Sometimes when we fought he brought it up.

But he didn't think about it all the time.

According to your logic, all Samuel's problems were my fault.

That's not true.

His pain came from a deeper place.

According to "his" logic you're to blame, as we heard.

What does he mean when he says his work was plundered?

No, there wasn't any plundering.

In the book that he abandoned, there was an interesting passage...

A passage?

How many pages?

About 20.

27.

It was just a rough outline.

I thought the idea was brilliant.

Can you summarize it?

Must we enter into a literary debate?

This isn't literary, it's concrete.

It's the heart of their conflict.

I don't know how else to present it to the jurors.

Nor do I.

Proceed.

Well...

It was about a guy imagining how his life would've been without the accident that killed his brother.

He wakes up and finds himself in two different realities.

In one, the accident is the center of his life.

In the other, it never happened.

I told Samuel I loved it.

He had me read everything he wrote back then.

Soon after, he abandoned the whole book.

I asked him if I could use the idea and he said yes.

No.

He couldn't have, he calls it plundering.

It's an argument.

People exaggerate and alter facts when they argue.

It's no exaggeration to say his book became yours: "ECLIPSE".

All I took was this idea.

My characters are a woman and her daughter, and I developed the story over 300 pages.

I can't believe I must tell you what's the difference between an outline and a novel?

He agreed to it.

And when he read it, he said

I did something very different.

Sometimes yes, when we argued it came out, because... he was upset because he couldn't write.

The only thing we know for sure is that "it came out".

Did the two of you... argue again before the time of his death?

It must've been very tense.

We were... we were both really shaken.

We were both keeping to ourselves and Samuel was...

I don't know, something was gone.

He was depleted, his energy was just gone.

In the audio, I hear Samuel Maleski arguing strenuously.

I hear a man determined to regain control of his life.

In no way a man who has decided to give up.

Samuel's psychiatrist said he was combative in their last sessions.

Do you kill yourself after fighting for time and self-esteem?

Do you kill yourself after pleading so fiercely and energetically for balance and justice in your relationship? No.

That's the main flaw in the suicide theory.

You say he seemed "depleted".

His energy was gone.

May I read from one of Mrs Voyter's recent books, "The Black House"?

We judge facts, not books.

Judge, this is a slippery slope.

In 2017, Sandra Voyter herself declared, and I quote,

"My books are linked to my life and those in it."

Objection! She's always said her work is fiction.

First book is her mother's death!

Second, a rift with her father.

Third, her son's accident, etc.

Her books are part of this trial.

Her life is in them, her relationship in particular.

Go ahead, but keep it brief.

This is a wife talking about her husband.

"He'd stopped complaining.

He'd given up."

"She studied him, repulsed by his resignation."

"An idea sprouted in her mind, a seed of deliverance."

"The possibility of his death."

Give us the context.

Later: "How does one kill?"

"What about the body? Its weight?

"She could think of nothing else.

"She saw him dead, his body a lump no longer desired.

"The body she'd loved was now in the way and had to go."

I'll provide the context.

This is a minor character, going insane, who doesn't act on her thoughts.

A novel is not life!

An author is not her characters.

But an author can express herself through her characters.

You flagged this passage.

How can we not see a link?

Is Stephen King a serial killer?

Did his wife turn up dead in suspicious circumstances?

Focus on the facts!

Mr. Renzi,

I strongly advise you to calm down.

Prosecutor, I advise you to follow Mr. Renzi's advice.

Focus on the facts.

Aside from the slap you admitted to, did you ever hit your husband?

Never?

That was the only time?

You were always a good, admirable soul, altruistic, reasonable, trying to save him from himself, except on this recording?

Rotten luck!

Any more questions for the witness?

I have one more, if I may.

I'd like to know if Maleski sent the transcripts to anyone?

He sent them to a publisher friend,

Paul Nachez, slated to publish his first novel.

Email from August 9, 2017:

"I'm writing again, I need your eye.

Still rough, eager to talk."

Nachez's response:

"Sure, send it and I'll read it."

Up to his death,

Maleski sent 4 texts a week.

What was their communication like?

The publisher never replied.

Apparently he was busy and the project mystified him.

His friend's silence must've hurt Mr. Maleski's already low self-esteem.

He feels rejected.

When we read all the writing he sent, it's difficult to identify a storyline.

At best, it's a project.

Maleski is a "project man".

His first abandoned novel, the chalet...

So, since we're being asked to mix justice and literature, to imagine what we don't know, let's imagine

Samuel Maleski's final year.

And I'm dabbling in fantasy?

Give me half the time you took to read a book!

Get to the point.

What was

Samuel Maleski's final year like?

After accumulating debt from medical procedures in London, he insists on returning to his hometown.

He finds a chalet to fix up and rent.

They'll pay off their debts.

He'll quit teaching and start writing full-time.

Renovation proves tricky.

They have to take out a loan.

A vicious circle begins.

Samuel needs his teaching wages.

Renovations drag on.

A year and a half later, he feels trapped.

He's a wounded man.

His son's accident, his abandoned novel, his wife publishing book after book.

He must write!

He quits the antidepressants and starts recording his life, embarking on a kind of auto-fiction, perhaps inspired by Sandra's method.

And why not?

She borrows from their lives.

She did borrow his idea.

Save it for your plea.

He's running.

But refuses to see that transcribing is not writing.

His publisher friend's silence humiliates him.

What do we hear in the March 4th fight?

The energy, the willfulness...

What is it?

The energy of despair.

The final push before giving up.

In his final days, this man isn't facing a war in his marriage.

He's facing his own failures.

Sandra Voyter is only guilty of succeeding where her husband failed.

Despite appearances, those were not

Mr. Renzi's closing arguments.

That wasn't Samuel.

It's Friday evening, we have a weekend ahead of us.

Before I adjourn,

I have an announcement.

I've decided to call Daniel back to the bar on Monday.

He has new information of interest.

Since the witness is the defendant's son and lives with his mother,

I'm asking everyone to refrain from contacting him.

Obviously, if contact is inevitable, refrain from discussing the trial.

Mrs Berger, you'll stay with Daniel all weekend.

See to it these rules are respected.

I insist that no one, absolutely no one, can ask him about his testimony.

Have a good weekend, get some rest.

Court is adjourned.

- Come get warm.

- Ready in 10!

You OK?

I think I want to be alone.

OK.

- You can eat in your room.

- No.

I want to be alone this weekend.

Before I testify.

Alone?

Just you and me?

Is that it?

Are you sure?

We can find other solutions.

It's a big house.

I want her to leave.

I just spoke to Daniel.

He wants to be alone this weekend.

Until the end of the trial.

Is that what you want?

OK. Is it because of what you heard today?

I couldn't talk to you about all that before.

We weren't allowed to..

No trial talk.

I know, I'm just talking to my son.

OK.

I totally understand that you need calm.

I can mind my own business, keep to myself.

I won't talk to you if you don't want. Can we try that?

No speaking English.

You can talk to me.

Couldn't you and I discuss this, and then you decide?

I think he's made his decision.

Yeah, I'll just get my stuff.

Somebody said, of course money doesn't make you happy, but it's still better to cry in a car than in a subway.

Who said that?

I don't know.

Sorry.

Go on.

Eat up.

Snoop...

Marge!

Marge, come quick, please!

What is it?

I gave him aspirin,

I messed up bad.

- You gave him aspirin?

- Yes!

How much?

8 or 10, I can't remember.

A lot.

Make him vomit.

Why'd you do that?

Make him vomit! Please!

OK, hang on.

"Make a dog vomit."

Hang on.

We need saltwater.

Be right back.

He's not moving.

Daniel, help me.

Open his mouth.

Easy.

That's right.

That's good.

He's coming around.

- What's happening?

- He's going to vomit.

That's it.

He'll be OK.

Good dog.

He's OK, he's breathing.

Looking at us.

Can you explain?

You know, I...

I'd never heard about... my dad's suicide attempt.

I'd never heard about... the shrink, the medicine... the vomit and aspirin.

When my mom talked about it,

I remembered something from around that time.

One morning,

Snoop was lying on my bedroom floor.

Not moving.

He smelled like vomit.

I figured he'd vomited.

I cleaned his muzzle.

I figured he'd...

I don't know, caught a virus or something, because... he acted strange for days.

He just slept or drank.

See? Now I'm thinking maybe he ate my dad's vomit, and "that" made him sick, and Mom told the truth!

So my experiment with the aspirin was to see how he'd react.

And you saw.

He slept for 14 hours.

Now he's drinking all the time.

He smells exactly the same!

Everything!

Everything's exactly the same!

But since..

Since yesterday,

I'm not sure if I believe her or not.

I knew they fought, but...

It wasn't...

I didn't think it was that violent.

Your memories are all you're sure of, and it's important to tell the jury.

But you're just a witness.

Do you think she could've killed him?

It's not for me to judge.

I know, but you could at least tell me!

I can't answer that.

My role is to protect you...

Fucking help me!

Actually, when we lack an element to judge something, and the lack is unbearable, all we can do is decide.

You see?

To overcome doubt, sometimes we have to... decide to sway one way rather than the other.

Since you need to believe one thing but have two choices, you must choose.

So you have to invent your belief?

Yes, well... in a sense.

So that means, I'm not sure... and you're saying

I have to pretend I'm sure?

No, I'm saying decide.

That's different.

What strikes me is we don't know who's more lyrical.

- The author or the character?

- Both, no doubt!

Voyter plays with confusion.

Her second book goes further, telling how her father couldn't stand the first.

Undoubtedly true.

The rift degenerates, forcing her to leave her country.

Fearing her father's rage, she falls prey to horrifying visions.

I found this troubling quote in an interview. She says,

"My job is to cover the tracks,"

"so fiction can destroy reality."

Yes, and what excites people about the Samuel Maleski case, is that it seems to come from one of her books.

It feels like she's already written it.

Even the doubts around his death, the way he died,

Voyter's murky personality, the amoral, deceptive traits she seems to overplay...

It all reads like her books.

I don't think it matters how he died.

The fact is, the idea of a writer killing her husband is far more compelling than a teacher killing himself.

If I imagine my mother doing it,

I don't understand.

But if I imagine my father...

I think I can understand.

Prosecutor, any questions?

The experiment on his dog proves nothing.

It's not documented.

More problematic are these providential memories, clearly jarred by what he heard during the trial.

No event can be placed convincingly on our timeline.

The time frame of 6 months before Maleski's death comes only from testimony given by the defendant herself.

I'd like to know...

Did you ever wonder if the overdose your father supposedly took might've resulted not from a suicide attempt, but from an attempt by your mother to poison him?

I'm not accusing, just making a point.

So, taking these speculations, why choose one over the other?

Your memories speak to the consequences, not the causes.

Yes, I thought about that, but...

I don't see why she would've done it.

It feels like when we lack proof to make us sure how something happened, we have to look further, as the trial is doing.

When we've looked everywhere and still don't understand how the thing happened,

I think we have to ask why it happened.

Thank you, Daniel.

Are you finished?

No.

I want to say something else.

Since my dog was sick for days,

Dad and I went to the vet.

Dad was really quiet in the car.

He didn't even play music.

He usually always does.

After a while, he started talking about Snoop.

He said,

"You know, he could get sick."

"Even die. You know that.

You need to be ready."

I didn't want to hear that.

Snoop was doing better.

He was still young.

He'd never been sick.

I told him he wasn't going to die.

But he kept going.

He said, "You need to be aware of it.

It'll happen someday."

"And it's no wonder Snoop gets tired."

"He's not so young in dog years."

"Can you imagine his life?"

"He's not just any dog."

"He's a great dog."

"An outstanding dog."

"Think about it.

He anticipates your needs,"

"foresees your movements,"

"keeps you safe from danger."

"He spends his life imagining your needs"

"thinking about what you can't see."

"Maybe he's tired."

"Always caring for others."

"Maybe one day, he'll be done."

"That could happen."

And I remember at the end, he said, "One day",

"when it's time for him to go, he'll go."

"You won't be able to help it.

Prepare yourself, it'll be hard."

"But it won't be the end of your life."

He meant himself.

Now...

Now I know he meant himself.

I implore the jurors to bear in mind this story is extremely subjective.

In no way does it qualify as any form of proof.

Yes Serge, we are still outside the courthouse in Grenoble.

The trial was scheduled to end on Friday, but Sandra Voyter's son Daniel insisted on testifying again this morning.

The jury is still...

Daniel.

Mrs Voyter, how do you feel... after being acquitted?

There were too many words in this trial.

I've nothing more to say.

I want to call my son and go home.

Obviously I thank my lawyers, who always believed in me.

Mr. Renzi, are you relieved?

I commend the jury, who saw Sandra Voyter as she is...

Marge, it's Sandra.

Yes, it's incredible, we're relieved.

Does Daniel want to talk to me?

Of course, he must be tired,

I understand.

Does he mind if I come home tonight?

Would he prefer tomorrow, or...

OK, OK.

We'll get some dinner, then I'll be home. See you then.

I need a drink.

Another!

Do you always...

When you win, do you always do this?

We never win.

That's the fucking first time in our life we win!

- No!

- Yes, of course!

You told me you're a good lawyer.

No, it's not true!

It's not spicy.

You have to try this, really.

We ate too much.

I'm gonna throw up.

A quick smoke first.

Be right back.

You first.

It's not so easy, huh?

With all the bones, and...

After this, we go?

Ready to go home?

I can drive, I can drive you.

One more.

For the road.

Of course, for the driver.

Same?

Can I just get two more of these? Thanks.

To you.

Are you alright?

Tell me.

I just, I thought...

I thought I'd feel relieved.

It doesn't come right away.

Sure?

Not sure.

It's just, you know, when you lose, you lose.

It's the worst thing that can happen, and if you win... you expect some reward.

But there isn't any.

It's just...

It's just over.

Maybe sometimes, we expect too much.

Yeah, maybe.

Hi.

Sorry.

He tried to wait up but fell asleep.

I'll be going now.

Not staying over?

No, I'll leave you be.

- Goodbye.

- Goodbye.

I was afraid of you coming home.

Me too,

I was afraid to come home.

It's always better on the piano,

I don't know why.

So to... answer your question, yes,

I carry her around with me quite a bit.

I've often seen her in the garden working.

Julia Vega swears that she's at the top of the stairs every morning when she comes down to do the laundry, making sure she's separating the whites and the darks.

And our children are very jealous because they've never seen her.

I... I...

I miss her terribly.

Hello?

Yes.

Of course.

Yes, I'm aware.

Oh.

Can you hold on one second, please?

That's terrible news. Is he gonna be okay?

No, I understand.

And no chance for a rehearsal?

Yes.

All right.

May I get three tickets for today?

Yes.

All right.

All right, yes, thank you.

You got 'em, boy!

- Leonard, bellissimo.

- Oh, yes.

Did you get any sleep?

No, I didn't get any sleep, Bruno.

"Manfred" starts on the downbeat rest, and you didn't get me any rehearsal with the orchestra.

I told you you were going on.

No, you told me it was a possibility.

Good afternoon.

United States Rubber Company again invites you to Carnegie Hall, to hear a concert of the New York

Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra of which Artur Rodziński is musical director.

Bruno Walter, who was to have conducted this afternoon, is ill, and his place will be taken by the young

American-born assistant conductor of the Philharmonic Symphony,

Leonard Bernstein.

Today, you were here for an historic performance.

This performance that was fantastic was broadcast all over the world.

And I feel obliged to say that Maestro Bernstein was called this morning at 9:30 and he was told that he would actually conduct here

- for the first time after many years--

- Without rehearsal.

Without rehearsal.

But he loves the music, he doesn't need rehearsal, he feels it so much.

And after many years, he really wanted this, it has happened and I'm so proud.

Carnegie Hall is so proud of you and New York is proud of you.

Leonard Bernstein.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

I'll tell you fellas, I don't remember a thing after that downbeat rest.

I must've blacked out and then when the audience applauded I came to.

Don't let this get in the way.

We're on a roll here, baby.

I wanna choreograph the segment with the dancers while in Cincinnati.

Jerry, I'm in love with the music.

I told you.

As soon as I have something,

I'll record and send it to you.

This the new ballet he's composing?

About three sailors on leave in New York getting up to no good?

- That's the one.

- Don't argue with him.

He's a young man to be reckoned with.

You can read it here.

- David, please.

- "Bernstein shows mastery of score."

"Youthful conductor carries out an exacting program--"

Sure, right next to Hitler's bombing of Poland.

Come on in, it's open.

- Sorry, gentlemen--

- No, no, he likes leaving the door open.

Hey, Isaac, you know David and that's Jerry Robbins.

- Hi.

- Hello. We've got to get downstairs.

- You're an hour late--

- I'm just working on the score--

- Rodziński's coming early--

- Rodziński's here?

- Okay, I'll be down in a second.

- Isaac.

Don't forget your show pony here is a composer.

I'm learning not to do it so hard, right?

- It's perfect.

- I always get so... overzealous.

- I get too excited.

- Right.

Both your feet in my lap.

I don't know what to do with it.

I don't know what to do with myself.

It's just too much.

- I think--

- It's too much for one man.

- Because it was on the liver spot?

- No.

It's too much for one man to take.

Honestly, David.

I mean, I'll never leave the apartment.

- That's the reality.

- Please don't.

Dear Jerry, this is an impromptu apology for the record which isn't so very bad, but it's not so very good either.

I'm looking through the score now, exhausted, and everything's okay up to number three when all the counterpoint comes in with the two pianos.

I'm afraid it's sort of messy there.

Anyway, it's hard to do on two pianos, so with an orchestra,

I think it'll be very clear.

And pardon all the mistakes.

But it was all Aaron Copland's fault.

- It was all my fault.

- And there he sits now.

- That's not true.

- Anyway...

I'll leave it to you to figure out,

Mr. Robbins, how to dance to this type of music, but, give my love to everybody and the thing, and, uh...

I hope you like it. Good luck, Jerry.

All right, got to get to rehearsal.

- I got it.

- You do?

- Yeah.

- You're such a chap.

It's downstairs and you're still going to be late.

Put in a word for me with Rodziński.

I will. I'm not his favorite, but I will.

- Love you, baby.

- Love you.

Brilliant, but... but what no one here knows is how he beat the soprano out of his poor baby sister performing all those operas when we were children.

Let that be fair warning to you and to everyone.

Hello.

Thought you might be here.

You've certainly been making the rounds.

Have you met the gang?

- No.

- Betty and Adolf, they're a riot.

- Hello.

- Hello.

Ellen. Of course, you've run into her at another studio, no doubt.

Hello, Felicia.

Who did I miss? Have I missed anyone?

Just the piano player.

Well, I figured you needed no introduction.

- Hello. I'm Lenny.

- Hello. Felicia.

Bernstein, like that one.

Montealegre.

Montealegre?

- Montealegre Cohn.

- Cohn?

Montealegre Cohn.

Well, that's an interesting marriage of words.

♪ You've got that look ♪

♪ That look that leaves me weak ♪

♪ You with your

Eyes across the table technique ♪

You come from an aristocratic

European family on your mother's side, and your father is American and he's Jewish and you moved to Chile because--

- It's amazing, I remember all this.

- I know.

I don't know how.

You moved to Chile because of your father's business.

And now you're firmly planted in New York City studying... piano, but you're actually studying acting.

A career which demands the versatility to play a panoply of characters.

And that is my conclusion, that you, my dear, are very similar to me.

- How?

- Because you had to take all the pieces, all the bits of you scattered across these varied landscapes and form, create the veritable person that stands before me now.

How is that similar?

- You just asked me and I told you.

- I know. Okay.

Russian Orthodox Jew.

- Growing up in Boston.

- Oh, someone else was listening.

- Child of immigrants.

- Yes.

Your father's a self-made businessman.

Steeped in Talmud.

Harvard.

- Then Curtis School for Music--

- Institute.

Institute of Music in Philadelphia.

Now firmly planted here in New York City pursuing composition and conducting.

Under the guise of a concert pianist drawn to this artistic Mecca, fleeing my puritanical origins just like you.

Surely your family was a tad more supportive.

My father imagined me a klezmer, playing for kopecks on the street corner, desperate for me to join the family business to make a living.

What was the family business?

Samuel J. Bernstein Hair Company.

- Really?

- Yes.

So I had no choice but to become a composite of adopted speech, manner and outlook on life, a composite, which enables me to be many things at once.

And that's why, we, you and I, are able to endure and survive

'cause the world wants us to be only one thing and I find that deplorable.

I find you very attractive, Felicia.

♪ Carried away, carried away ♪

♪ You got carried away ♪

It's really too much. I'm very sorry.

Wait! Wait!

Go! Go! Go!

Oh, I like that.

You've a lot of energy, have to tell you.

I'm just following you.

I don't know where.

I've never been in this part of town.

I can't imagine you being in a place like this.

- Now, you go in here.

- Okay.

- Just on the stage-- Take your shoes off.

- Oh.

Okay. Where do I put them?

Over on the other side.

- Where are you going?

- I'm just getting the script.

- The script?

- Yes.

- Would I have to act too?

- What?

- Do I have to do something?

- Well... maybe.

Now I'm nervous.

You should be nervous.

Well, this is just lovely.

This is just lovely.

I'm going to read a scene with Maestro Bernstein.

I better make a show of myself.

Maestro Bernstein?

That sounds very fancy.

- Here.

- Okay. We're gonna read it.

- We're actually gonna do it.

- Yes.

- I'm the king?

- You're the king, and this is your castle.

Oh, wonderful.

Now, even though you are the king,

- you're quite taken with me.

- Yes.

So, you decided to give me a white rose from your crown.

Of course I did.

No, you don't have it yet.

I have to give it to you.

- Here's your flower.

- I didn't read the play.

- I know.

- Hold on.

Can you hold this for me, please?

All right.

Since I'm the king... who's in love.

A gift for me, my liege?

Oh, that's very good.

- It's your line.

- Oh, uh...

"With your little spots of wax, white rose, you look like the extravagantly hands her the flower--"

No, no, no.

"You look like the eye... of a broken moon."

You are terrible.

What's your line?

"You're always changing, my love."

"I didn't see you yesterday."

"But I looked at your horse."

"It's so beautiful."

"But not as beautiful as you are... because you are a dragon."

"I believe you could break me in two with your arms, as weak as I am... like frost burned in the sun."

That's a bit better, isn't it, Ms. Montealegre?

Little more light?

- Why, thank you, Joseph.

- Oh, Joseph, I apologize.

I got nervous. I thought it was a spider and I tried to kill it with my jacket.

Give the stage door a shove on your way out. It'll lock on its own.

Thank you, Joseph.

Good night. Marvelous.

Thank you, Joseph.

You didn't tell me your father owns this place.

Is this how you lure in all your male suitors?

No, I... I rarely stay up past 9:00.

Hold on a sec.

You made an exception for me?

I thought maybe you were worth making an exception for.

Oh, well,

I hope it doesn't cost you too much.

How can I make it worth your while?

Oh, I've got it.

- Something's wrong.

- What?

- What's your character's name?

- Um...

- Margaret.

- Margaret.

- Margaret.

- Yes.

- And you're the understudy?

- Yes.

I think you should be Margaret eight shows a week.

Front and center.

- If it's fear that's stopping you--

- There are many things stopping me but fear isn't one of them.

I wouldn't be standing here in front of you...

I wouldn't even be in New York City if fear got the better of me.

It's just not that easy.

We'd be fools not to think that luck plays a part as well as talent and determination.

- I'm a perfect example of that.

- Oh, you must be joking.

If Bruno Walter hadn't gotten sick that fateful day and Rodziński snowed in upstate,

I never would've had my debut.

I'd be teaching piano to little eight-year-olds who complain--

If it wasn't that day, it would've been another.

- Is that what you think?

- Yes, I know it.

- Really?

- Of course.

And don't forget... you are a man.

I never do.

Right.

Oh, my God.

Bravo!

You were marvelous.

Oh, my goodness.

Shirley, it was very kind of you to come.

- I brought Richard Hart and his wife, Lil.

- No.

Dick is rehearsing his new Broadway show with Eva Gabor and he is not long for this marriage and, well, I think he is your type.

- What type is that?

- Same as mine, unavailable.

Marvelous.

Ah, ah...

It's so kind of you to come.

I just love Dark of the Moon.

Oh, stop. You're marvelous.

The production is better for you being in it.

It's only for the week, but that's kind of you to say.

If they had any sense, they'll tell Ms. Jones to stay in bed.

You really are wonderful.

- Dear.

- Thank you, it's so kind of you to come.

- My pleasure.

- Thank you.

- Come have a bite with us.

- Oh, I, uh...

I can't, I'm catching the train to Tanglewood in the morning.

- Tanglewood?

- Mmm.

You're going to see my brother.

- Well, don't look so surprised.

- I'm not... I just...

He didn't mention it.

Well...

- Perhaps he was being discreet?

- My brother?

I doubt it.

- No, try again.

- Oh, gee, it's six.

- No!

- Eight.

- Terrible.

- It's four...

- No.

- Three.

Well, it has to be seven then.

Can you try to just concentrate?

Maybe I should stop and think for a second.

You just stop and think

'cause I am sending it to you right now.

- Twenty.

- No.

No.

So, how long do we have to do this for?

Well, we need to build up a very strong connection.

- I can't. I don't know what you're doing.

- Hmm?

You could be building a bomb back there for all I know.

No.

- I'm just very terribly relaxed.

- Blow the whole place up.

Aren't you?

- Yes, I am.

- Are you?

Yes.

I've never seen you sit still for so long.

- Are you itching to move?

- No, I'm not.

- Good.

- Actually, at all.

Come here, I'll do it.

My goodness.

- I'm useless, aren't I?

- You are.

Where am I going?

- Here, stand there. Not this one.

- Okay.

- Not.

- Oh, why not?

Well... a bit garish maybe?

Doesn't look bumbling so much.

I like this.

I love your smell.

- You do?

- I do.

It's my father.

Isn't that odd?

I used to just love... wrapping myself up in his trench coat, when he would walk in the door at night from work...

That smell would intoxicate me.

I always associated it with feeling safe.

She's so beautiful.

Tell me about her.

- She's wonderful. She's a lovely girl.

- Yes.

- And we're just--

- Where did you meet?

- We met at a party at Claudio Arrau's.

- Ah.

So, Felicia, are you an actress?

- Marvelous actress, yes.

- No, I am.

- Of course you are.

- No, I am.

Unbelievably, I am.

- He is not.

- No, horrible.

- No, I am.

- Screen tested once in LA

- and it was horrible.

- Terrible actor.

They sent me to Hollywood and put me on camera and said, "Thank you, here's a one-way ticket back to New York City."

- Oh, no.

- "Oh, no" is right.

He was a student here at our inaugural summer and now... he's everyone's favorite teacher and you can't even get into the shed when he's conducting the student orchestra because it's so full.

- It's only because I love them so much.

- And they love you.

Tell me what happened with the Rochester Philharmonic.

- Oh, they passed me over.

- Yes, I know.

They thought I was spending too much time with you in Boston.

- Is that the reason?

- I believe it was.

We should really discuss

"Our Town" if you have...

Running off to Hollywood?

- Wasting time on musical theater...

- I promise,

I'm giving up musical theater.

Lenny, you are responsible on account of your gifts.

He can be the first great American conductor.

But he would have to conduct his life in such a way that when he comes out on stage to lead his orchestra, he can truthfully say to himself,

"My life and my work are clean."

And the name...

To a Bernstein, they will never give an orchestra.

But a Burns?

Leonard S. Burns.

- I'd have to sleep on that.

- I used to entertain people on the train going back and forth to Moscow.

And upon every arrival,

I had to return straightaway because, of course, as Jews, we weren't allowed to live there.

I never saw the city.

Not once.

But I got to play.

I want to see them.

See what?

All the things

Maestro Koussevitsky wants you to give up.

All the music you've made.

- You do? We can't just leave.

- Yes.

Oh, yes, we can.

Unbelievable.

Why would you ever want to give this up?

- It's so wonderful.

- It's not serious music, is it?

Well, what does that mean?

Well, it means... he thinks I could be the first great American conductor.

Is that what you want?

I want a lot of things.

♪ New York, New York! ♪

♪ It's a hell of a town! ♪

How do you feel?

I think it's better.

Is it okay if I put my head like this?

- It's terribly embarrassing.

- No.

- No.

- It's as if I don't--

If I just don't breathe, I'll be fine.

Just... No.

- It happens every time.

- Every time what?

- What do you mean?

- Every time I go to bed

- that I'm not used to.

- Oh, I see.

- Well, you implied.

- Well, I don't know what you meant.

- I was just...

- Oh, goodness.

- It's the lower spine...

- Do you take any pills or anything?

- I take plenty of pills.

- No, I mean, sure you do, but, I mean, specifically for this.

- Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

- Hmm.

You poor thing.

- That's much better, being on the floor.

- Yes.

Much better. Thank you. It's a great idea.

You set it all up with the pillows.

- You really do take care of me.

- I wanted to make you comfortable.

I have a game we can play.

Envy and Secrets.

- You know that game?

- No.

We both tell each other a secret, then we tell each other something that we're envious of and then we become closer.

But I feel pretty close already.

You certainly seem closer than 20 minutes ago.

- Okay.

- I saw different sides of you

- that I've only sort of dreamt about.

- Oh, goodness.

Okay.

You go first.

Do you wanna say something you're envious of or something that's a secret?

Tell me a secret.

- Oh, I'm gonna tell you a secret?

- Yes.

- Did I just ash on you...

- No.

Okay.

Well, when I was a boy...

Mmm.

...I used to have dreams where I would kill my father.

And the thing of it is, I would wake up from the dream and I'd sit in bed... and I would just fantasize about it...

'cause he was so cruel.

Sometimes I just can't...

Can't seem to find myself.

Well...

I agree, by the way.

- About what?

- About the name.

Felicia Burns.

It has absolutely no luster.

I mean, it just sounds wrong.

- Well, your sound soothes me... God.

- Does it?

I actually envy the air that gets to funnel its way through you.

Out of my mouth, I hope.

- Well, any which way, actually.

- No.

I never thought of it like that.

But it would definitely be some tonal pitch variations if it came out the other end, wouldn't it?

Just as pleasing, I assume.

- Am I shaking?

- You're disgusting. Yes.

Those eyes...

You don't even know how much you need me, do you?

I might.

Sweetie, that was better than Philadelphia.

- Really?

- It took everything from me

- not to leap right into the orchestra.

- You're too kind.

Did I tell you about the girl?

The girl that I wrote letters... Felicia.

- The one I wrote about.

- Yes, yes.

This is David and he plays the clarinet.

What else does he--

- I play the clarinet.

- I can see.

- And he's extraordinary.

- Yes.

Oh, well, I was listening, you were wonderful.

You as well. Broadway star.

Oh, no.

We're gonna have lunch with Kouss, otherwise we'd...

What about later?

Have a drink or something?

I would love that, yeah.

- I didn't mean to spring that on you.

- No, that's all right.

- Maybe that was insensitive of me.

- No.

Not at all.

- So, we'll see you later on.

- Yes.

Okay, let's go. Come on.

Come on, little birdy!

- Lovely to meet you.

- Lovely to meet you.

Oh, life is not that serious.

Honest, it isn't.

What age are we living in?

One can be as free as one likes without guilt or confession.

Please, what's the harm?

I know exactly who you are.

Let's... give it a whirl.

- Yes.

- Yes?

- I mean--

- No!

- Not here.

- No, not here.

No, it's not how I meant it to be.

Leonard Bernstein is a composer, conductor and pianist.

His wife, Felicia Montealegre, is an actress.

Both lead full, professional lives, but they're seldom apart.

Mr. Bernstein is 37 years old but he has been in the public eye for a dozen years.

From the time he substituted for Bruno Walter to conduct the Philharmonic Symphony at the age of 25, since then, Leonard Bernstein has conducted or played all over the world.

And he's written symphonies, ballets, and opera, as well as scores for the Broadway musical Wonderful Town and the motion picture On the Waterfront.

Felicia Montealegre came to Broadway and American television from Santiago, Chile.

She was one of television's first full-fledged dramatic stars.

The Bernsteins, Leonard, Felicia and their children,

Jamie and two-months-old Alexander, live in New York City near Carnegie Hall and Broadway.

They've been here for about three years.

Good evening, Felicia.

- Hello, Ed.

- Good evening, Lenny.

- How are you, Ed?

- Good.

Lenny, it's always, for me, rather difficult to classify you professionally since you do so many things at the same time.

What do you consider your primary occupation?

I guess I'd have to say that my primary occupation is musician.

Anything that has to do with music is my province, wouldn't you say?

Whether it's composing it or conducting it, or teaching it, or studying it, or playing it.

As long as it's music,

I like it and I do it.

Felicia, do you have trouble keeping up with Lenny's activities?

It gets pretty hard.

He's taken on many activities.

This season promises to be a very hectic one.

Among them, he's writing two musical shows.

One of them is an adaptation,

Romeo and Juliet, that's West Side Story with Jerry Robbins and Arthur Laurents and wonderfully-talented young lyricist

Stevie Sondheim.

And then he's doing four feature presentations in Omnibus, the CBS television program.

And, um...

- Was that right?

- You know my schedule better than I do.

Felicia, what about you?

Are you engaged in other things besides acting?

Well, it gets pretty hard to do much more than take care of this household.

My husband, the children, and acting takes the rest of the time that's left over.

- And memorizing my projects.

- Well...

I can't help that.

Lenny, what's the big difference in the life of Composer Bernstein and Conductor Bernstein?

Well, I sup...

I suppose it's a difference. It's... a personality difference which occurs between any composer versus any... or any creator versus any performer.

Any performer, whether it's

Toscanini or Tallulah Bankhead, whoever it is, leads a kind of public life.

An extrovert life, if you will.

It's an oversimplified word, but something like that.

Whereas a creative person, uh, sits alone in this great studio that you see here and writes all by himself and... communicates with the world in a very private way and... and lives a rather... grand inner life rather than a grand outer life.

And if you carry around both personalities...

I suppose that means you become a schizophrenic and that's the end of it.

Felicia, you must be interested in music too, aren't you?

Daddy.

Daddy!

Catch!

Well, I love you too, darling.

So much. Thank you.

Well, hello, children of Zeus!

My man!

- Hello, Lenny.

- Hello.

What a lovely surprise.

That's why I love New York City.

Come out of your apartment and all of sudden you just run into people that you love.

- I'm going downtown. Oh.

- So am I.

Well, we're cutting across the park to go to Saks

- before the deluge.

- Who are you? Hello. Hello.

Hello, you're so beautiful.

You're so precious.

Can I tell you a secret?

Do you know

I slept with both your parents?

Too much, isn't it? Too much.

I love too much, what can I say?

But I'm reining it in.

I'm reining it in!

See those people across the avenue staring at us?

Saying, "It can't be him.

He's much better-looking on television."

"Certainly has Leonard Bernstein's ears though, doesn't he?"

"Can that be him? Is that possible?"

How embarrassing.

We don't even have silverware.

- Here.

- Oh, I'm sorry, darling.

What's wrong with the silverware?

We don't need it.

I ordered the Chinese food, remember?

The problem is we need those fucking curtains so I can sleep.

Walk around like a zombie.

Scare all our children.

- Do we have children in this house?

- We do.

I don't know how the Bergs do it.

Three children.

Three! I know, it's unbelievable.

Unreasonable.

Alex doesn't make any noise.

I think we'll be fine.

- No, for now.

- Sleeps all day.

- Alexander, our sleeping little baby.

- He won't sleep for long.

- It's like he isn't even real.

- No.

Dream baby.

I'm sad, darling, and I don't know why.

Darling, you're so tired.

You just need to sleep.

Yes.

Summer sang in me a little while, it sings in me no more.

Edna St. Vincent Millay.

If the summer doesn't sing in you, then nothing sings in you.

And if nothing sings in you, then you can't make music.

There's a price for being in my brother's orbit, you know that.

As much as he'd love to believe the opposite is true.

I suppose

I do understand what you mean.

Well, it's very strange, but I...

I do believe there is that in everybody.

One wishes to make adjustments to oneself.

This way.

But... having this imposition of a strong personality, it's like a way of death.

Really.

Yet the moment I see that that is making him suffer, well, I realize it's not worth it.

No. What for? It isn't going to kill me.

If it was going to give him pleasure or stop him from suffering and it's in my power to do it then what the hell?

But one has to do it completely without sacrifice.

And if there's going to be a sacrifice, then I disappear.

Good?

Oh!

That time, that time really was good!

- Wicker!

- Oh, my God!

White antique wicker with Pierre Deux cushions.

- I love it.

- It will give it that whimsical, Victorian conservatory look.

So you want to lock me up in a glass cage like some sort of exotic bird.

I'm surrounded by men and it feels so right.

They are really better.

I think Felicia is... I don't know...

I just can't make heads or tails of her.

She's fine. She's just, you know, I mean...

Are you all right? Do you need to get a towel or something?

Julia! Julia! Julia!

I think we need a towel.

It's that you're so distracted all the time.

I'm going to go take a big dump.

Okay, wonderful.

- Oh, my God.

- Has Daddy mentioned anything about

- Harry and Amberson this summer?

- No.

Oh, Harry's offering me a job at Amberson this summer.

What do you think?

- What does Daddy say?

- Daddy thinks it's a great idea.

Then I think it's great.

- So I have your blessing?

- Yes.

- Thank you. Bye.

- I love you. Bye.

- She looks so grown up.

- Looks can be deceiving.

I got the go ahead.

Thank you so much.

Be really good at this. Be really good.

- So happy.

- You're intimidating me. I'll try my best.

I just got trampled on in my own house.

Come here.

I want you to meet a few people.

This guy almost trampled all over me.

- I was decapitated--

- Listen to me--

- I know, I'm tired, please--

- This is Lenny.

- Hello! How are you?

- This is Charlie.

All my hands are taken.

- You're a big fellow. Grand man.

- Jim.

You're a huge fellow. Hello, Charlie.

Pleasure. How are you? Having a good time?

Lenny should be composing.

- Well...

- No, Harry loves to play it on the side of him with the appearances and the recordings and... cookie-cutter boys.

- You know, he's not my favorite.

- My favorite.

No, I know, he's not my favorite.

- Well...

- Well...

- You're taking it like a champ.

- You are.

- I would never know.

- Handling it quite well.

- Our little Joan of Arc.

- Yes.

But remember what happened to Joan.

Didn't work out so well.

So bored.

- Hello, Scott.

- Hello.

We don't say that in our family.

Felicia doesn't like it.

- In your family?

- In my family.

Your family, Lenny?

Okay, that's enough.

- We've been together for ten years.

- Believe me, I know three of them.

I guess denial is not just a river in Egypt.

- That was the crossword. Three letters.

- Really?

Pun.

- Yes, it is "pun".

- Yes, it is.

- Did you do it Thursday?

- Yes.

- It's quite easy, but--

- Yeah.

- Hello.

- Hi, I'm Tommy.

Did you just appear out of my handkerchief?

- I live here now.

- Are you a genie?

- I wish.

- Do I get three wishes?

- What's your first wish? Hi.

- My first wish.

Good luck. Bye, Tommy.

Sorry, I don't even know if you--

- It's beautiful.

- Oh, thank you.

- Felicia puts it together.

- She does a good job.

If I was left to my devices,

I'd be dressed like a clown.

That's the truth. Don't tell anybody.

Mind if I smoke in the other room?

Where do you live? Who are you?

- I'm from San Francisco.

- So you're from Earth?

Originally, yes.

- Your hair is glorious.

- That's sweet of you.

Listen, I have to go to the roof.

I need some air.

- Would you mind to come with me?

- I'd love to.

That's wonderful. Come here.

Tommy, is it?

- Toast of the party.

- Belle of the ball.

The belle of the ball!

- My God, are you kidding me?

- Both at the same time. Somehow.

A highwire act. Toast bell. Toast bell.

Have you seen Lenny anywhere?

Do you want me to fetch him?

No, I don't mind.

That's what I'm saying, that I needed the turtleneck.

I needed the turtleneck, you know what I'm saying?

I mean, that's the...

As I break this fucking wall.

- How will we solve this problem?

- I don't know what to do.

I'm worried about it.

We have to figure it out.

Well, don't they...

Do your listeners know what you look like?

The problem is you're in radio, you need to be in television.

- Stop.

- You're gorgeous. May I?

Darling, this is Tommy.

- Everything okay?

- It's okay.

Darling.

Why don't you go through here? It's fine.

- Darling.

- No.

I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

Fix your hair. You're getting sloppy.

Well, like it or not, this world is utterly fascinated, obsessed even, with everything about you.

Ever since that famous phone call which led to your debut at Carnegie Hall.

And you have not let them down, my dear.

Fifteen years on television, teaching us all the magic of classical music, the Young People's Concerts and Omnibus reaching hundreds of millions all over the world, ten years at the New York Philharmonic and then there are the compositions.

West Side Story redefined the American musical.

- Jesus Christ.

- Then there's Candide and On the Town.

Actually, when you add it up, there's not much that I've created.

Music is... I don't...

I know this is gonna sound strange, it was the most important thing I could do and a great source of dissatisfaction that I haven't created that much at all.

I mean, when you add it up, it's not a very long list.

Well...

What this is...

This is an opportunity for the world to get to know you apart from all that.

This book is to understand what you think about in your private moments.

Your personal feelings on, well, on life as you know it.

I feel like the world is on the verge of collapse.

That's what I feel like.

I'm quite serious.

- Yes.

- The diminution of creativity, which has come to a grinding halt.

I mean, not scientifically.

That has exploded.

But as we sit here,

I find it very difficult to... think that... whether I'm a conductor or a composer, of any note, has any bearing on anything.

Or that my existence is even worth talking about for this book.

No, I agree. I agree.

I think this has marked many artists and you can see it in their work.

This seems to seep into the subconscious

- so that there's this great depression--

- But I know that Felicia...

She senses it enormously.

It's all pervasive.

It's almost as if she can't enjoy anything anymore.

I know.

- It just seems so sad.

- A picnic... the water, lunch... sitting around being together.

What is that?

I think she has a keen sense of futility.

I sense that too about her.

I had no idea because I had this feeling of her first, incredibly, which she is, vivacious and marvelously alert and aware and a happy person, but something in her seems crushed.

She said to me in Vienna last month,

"I want to get off.

I want to stop the bus and get off."

- Mmm.

- Mmm.

And how do you feel about that?

I have one or two saving factors.

One is it that I love people, and I love music. I love music so much it keeps me glued to life even when I'm most depressed.

And I can get very deeply depressed.

But I have a work ethic and that keeps me afloat.

And the other is that

I love people so much that... it's hard for me to be alone.

Which is part of my struggle as a composer.

Yes.

You are the only person I've met who leaves the bathroom door open for fear of being alone.

I mean, can one really believe that man is just this trapped animal.

He's a victim of his own greeds and follies and...

Either one believes in the divine element in this or one doesn't.

As long as I believe it... which I assume is why I love people so much, then I have to believe that in some remote corner of my soul there is a way out.

Okay, so, sopranos... you're on the hot seat.

Take it from bar 44, just from the end of

"Make our garden grow, make our garden grow," heading to the a cappella.

And, sopranos, make sure that you... make space so that the high notes can soar.

- It means--

- It is... "I'm dying and I'm growing a hernia."

It's an old Chilean expression.

I was desperate to find a rhyme,

I couldn't.

- I woke her up--

- Your mother was from Rovno Gubernia.

In the middle of the night, desperate.

There's a Chilean idiom, top of her head.

You woke me up from a very deep sleep.

It's the exact piece.

In fact, all of the Spanish here is all from Felicia.

We're lucky that she's here today to help with the pronunciation.

That's right. I'm sorry, I've been...

I was looking through Voltaire's work and I couldn't find Rovno Gubernia.

That's because I made it up, my dear boy.

Let's see what you think.

- See what you think.

- This is gorgeous.

I know, isn't it lovely?

- All right, there you go.

- Thank you.

Come on. Let's go.

Lenny, what do you want me to get?

You could just get that big-ass bag of kibble.

Oh, Lord. Thank you.

It's Jamie.

And I wanted to have a drink.

Daddy!

Hello, darling.

Help yourself after. Just go right there.

Is this all Felicia's idea?

I had nothing to do with it.

Her painting as well.

- So beautiful.

- Lenny.

- What is it, darling?

- Have you seen Jamie?

- I have not seen Jamie.

- You haven't seen her?

No.

- Why? Is she here?

- Yes, she's here.

She's terribly upset, darling.

What is she upset about?

She's been hearing gossip.

- Excuse me?

- Gossip.

- Gossip about what?

- About you, darling.

What about me?

I don't know.

She's been up at Tanglewood all summer.

I can't imagine what she might've heard.

Well, what did you tell her?

Darling, it's not for me really to say.

I said she should speak to you.

She's old enough, don't you think?

I don't care how old she is,

I ask that you be discreet.

I think she's completely at an age where she needs to, deserves to know.

I mean, darling, she didn't ask for any of this.

- It was my decision.

- Well, no, it's our decision.

It's not just yours.

Don't you dare tell her the truth.

Jamiery Creamery.

- Welcome home.

- Well, look at this.

Hello.

- Hi.

- Hello. Wow.

Not what I expected.

Did you write a new song or something?

I was reading. Keeping my journal.

You have a nice trip?

- Did you see Tommy?

- Oh, yes, he waved.

I thought that would make you happy.

He's gonna spend the weekend.

Wonderful.

Smart as a whip, that boy.

Keeps me on my toes.

See how he does the anagrams.

He's a sweet boy.

Yeah, you know, your mother told me that you... are very upset because you heard some rumors about me at Tanglewood this summer.

I really wish she wouldn't have said anything.

- Jamie...

- It's fine, it's no big deal.

- It is a big deal because you're upset.

- I wasn't upset.

So let's discuss it.

Your mother and I have talked about it and...

I said I'd come down here and talk to you about it.

- I--

- Try to enlighten or shed some sort of understanding on what could've happened, so...

- Jealousy is the word that I would use.

- What?

Jealousy.

When I was a... student at Curtis, there was a boy...

Seemed like a nice boy. Brought a pistol to school, tried to kill me because he was jealous of my musical...

- talent.

- Your musical talent.

It just drove him to the brink of murder.

Artur Rodziński was the musical director of the New York Philharmonic.

God told him to hire me.

Tried to strangle me during a rehearsal.

Because of jealousy.

Now, I don't know what happened or who said what or where, but I can only imagine that it was spurned on by jealousy, darling.

Jealousy of...

Of whatever it is that I do that has plagued me all my life and I apologize for plaguing you now.

But I hope that helps.

So the rumors aren't true?

No, darling.

Thank you... for coming to talk to me.

I'm relieved.

- Let's go inside.

- What...

All right, what color?

Here we have--

We've got three shades of the exact same red.

It's not the exact same red.

This one apparently is blue.

- I'm gonna try--

- Blue--

So we're just giving up on anagrams, guys?

You're gonna make it a design.

- Having a nail session.

- You're an artist.

Look at this, it's a little checker.

I thought it was a good idea for him to come for the weekend.

I know how much

Jamie loves being with him.

- Jamie?

- You like him too, don't you?

Yes, I do.

Darling, if I've done

- something wrong, tell me.

- No.

No, I don't know why

Jamie is particularly...

I don't know why you said she was particularly interested in...

Well, Tommy is very, sort of, warm, and he's highly intelligent, as is our daughter.

- Okay.

- And--

- No, I'm not saying that--

- No, I have an interest in spending time with him too.

I'm not trying to shove it off that I brought him here for her.

- Clearly not.

- Well, no, obviously not.

All I'm saying is that's just another reason why.

- But I can easily tell him not to come.

- No.

I misread the room, clearly.

- No.

- I misread the room.

Well, it's not really about that. It's about...

- What is it about?

- No, nothing.

Okay. All right.

So, then, it's fine?

Yes?

- Yes.

- All right, darling.

I'll do it. Okay.

- What?

- No, I just...

Nothing. I thought we were having a conversation.

- But we were.

- No.

- I'm sorry. I thought we were finished.

- I know you're busy.

I'm not busy,

I'm just desperate to finish this.

Well, then, do it, darling.

I'm not stopping you. Do it.

Where is everybody? Oh, they're here.

Hello, everyone,

I have an announcement to make.

I have finished "Mass."

Yay, Dad.

Where is Mummy going?

Julia, who left the Snoopy in the vestibule?

Hello, Brian. Alex.

Who left...

Who abandoned Snoopy in the vestibule?

- Who abandoned Snoopy?

- That was me. I'm sorry, Daddy.

I mean, it's his day.

- He started eating it...

- Daddy, you have to see me.

- How many?

- Stop.

- Why are you going on and on about this?

- How many?

- I'm so sorry.

- There was a woman--

You're a day late for Thanksgiving.

I know. Harry had me going all over.

I had to do--

Nina was very upset.

Well, I don't think...

Nina doesn't seem so upset.

Did you hear her screaming about some random woman?

You finally got her to come.

- As a surprise for you--

- Daddy!

Of course. Thank you, Julia.

Nina's not upset about the woman.

She's upset about you almost missing Thanksgiving.

- We didn't know if you were coming.

- Happy Thanksgiving.

- Mike, please stay.

- Thanks.

- I got to go down.

- Jamie, take him.

- Yeah, come on, Mike.

- Thank you.

- Do you want any snacks first?

- No, I'm good.

Happy Thanksgiving.

- Darling?

- Mmm.

For a second I thought...

- It was quite a stunt that you pulled.

- What?

- That was quite a stunt that you pulled.

- What do you mean?

Well, darling, you put the pillow outside and the slippers and the toothpaste and the toothbrush and I haven't seen you since.

I understand you're angry with me.

Jesus Christ. But, I mean... let's be reasonable.

There's a saying in Chile about never standing under a bird that's full of shit.

And I've just been living under that fucking bird for so long, it's actually become comedic.

Well, I think...

- that you're letting your sadness get--

- Oh, stop it!

- Let me finish...

- That has nothing to do with me...

- ...what I'm going to say. I think...

- No.

...you're letting your sadness get the better of you.

It's about you, so you should love it.

You want to be sleepless and depressed and sick.

So you can avoid fulfilling your obligations.

- What obligations?

- To what you've been given.

The gift that you've been given.

- Please.

- My God.

The gift comes with burdens.

Do you have any idea?

- The burden of feigning honesty and love.

- Sorry, that's the truth.

That above all you love people and from that wellspring of love the complications arise in your life.

- That's exactly right.

- Wake up! Take off your glasses.

Hate in your heart.

Hate in your heart and anger.

There's so many things, it's hard to count.

That's what drives you.

Deep, deep anger drives you.

You aren't on that podium allowing us to experience the music the way it was intended.

You are throwing it in our faces.

- How dare you?

- How much we'll never be able to ever understand and by us witnessing you do it so effortlessly, you hope that we will know, really know, deep in our core

- how less than we all are for you.

- That's your issue.

- And it's your hubris--

- Join the crowd.

You prance around with all your dewy-eyed waiters that Harry corrals for you under the guise they have something intellectual to offer you

- while you are "teaching" them.

- Well, at least my heart is open.

The audacity to say that!

Have you forgotten about the four years where you couldn't decide if you wanted to marry me?

- That's what I think.

- The idea of you?

The Chamberlain movie we saw last week, he said, "How could I compete with the man you think I am?"

Thank God I met Dick so I could fucking survive your indecision.

- Dick Hart. Richard Hart.

- Yes.

- Who fucking died.

- Who loved me.

- Who died.

- Who loved me.

Yeah, he's a corpse now and I was the one who was a fool waiting outside the fucking hospital for you like an idiot in my truth.

Your truth is a fucking lie!

It sucks up the energy in every room and gives the rest of us zero opportunity to live or even breathe as our true selves.

Your truth makes you brave and strong and saps the rest of us of any kind of bravery or strength.

Because it's so draining, Lenny.

It's so draining to love and accept someone who doesn't love and accept themselves.

And that's the only truth

I know about you.

If you're not careful, you're going to die a lonely, old queen.

Mommy! Daddy!

Mom! Dad!

- Daddy!

- Mom!

- Snoopy's here, hurry up!

- Come on.

Mommy! You're missing Snoopy.

What are you guys doing in there?

- He's so big.

- You've been in there for ages.

- Dad!

- Yes.

Come on.

I'll go.

Hello.

Hello. How are you?

Hello. Hello. How are you?

Wonderful. Hello. Hello.

What I love about these Thursday rehearsals is that we get a chance to talk to you about what we think of the music.

So, thank you for coming and good afternoon.

Um, today we're studying

Shostakovich's 14th Opus 135.

What I realized about this piece...

It could be morbid, but I tend to think that it's not...

...is that as death approaches...

I believe that an artist must cast off anything that's restraining him.

And an artist must be resolute in creating, whatever time he has left, in absolute freedom.

And that's why...

I have to do this for myself,

I have to live... the rest of my life, however long or short that may be, exactly the way that I want.

As more and more of us are in this day and age.

That's the scene.

My goodness. I don't think my mouth has ever moved so fast.

- You are sweet, Colin.

- Here you are, Felicia.

I'd love to do one more.

- Yes, of course.

- If you don't mind.

So, this thing where, remember if you hold the score low you get a better bounce.

Lower. I was doing it high.

If we do it again,

I'd love to start at bar 44.

And I do believe percussion could be a little bit quiet.

- Still have a headache?

- It's fine.

- Cynthia.

- Do they realize it's only a matter of time before you direct the production?

Already happening. The carpet was a different color yesterday.

- I was right about the carpet.

- I agree.

I just forgot how much I love being at work.

- We're almost finished.

- Reservation can wait.

- This is such a hoot. Really.

- Wait.

I thought tonight was my night to take you out.

Oh, you both have to stop worrying about me. I'm fine.

- I'm busier than ever.

- Better, not busier.

Though, boy, that's true, isn't it?

I mean, doesn't the...

Poor Murderer go into previews the next week?

Don't remind me.

Who said anything about worrying?

I'm just greedy to have as much of you as I can get.

I'm all yours.

What were you talking about?

I was talking about how...

- What was I talking about?

- I can't remember.

Maybe I was saying how handsome everybody looks tonight.

A lot of hombres. Lots.

Chicken? That's what we call them.

Always good with the chickens.

You really like the chickens.

- I love the chickens.

- I know you do.

- Harry, do I--

- Yeah.

- Just do it off there.

- Yeah.

- Did you get it?

- Like a pro.

It's raining down on me through your fucking nose.

It's fine. Just right over here.

Here you go. I'll just serve everybody.

- Oh, Lenny--

- I'm fine. Thank you.

- I'm sorry--

- It's okay. Thank you. It's fine.

Jerry Robbins was right, you can't maintain a relationship when you're living in various hotel rooms.

- You'll start to upset me now.

- Listen.

No, darling, no, I just wanted to...

I called because I wanted to ask what your plans were for the weekend.

We're gonna be home in a couple of days.

I thought we could all spend it in

Fairfield. You just have to nudge Mommy.

Who's we, Daddy?

No, I...

Well, he's not a monster.

He's an utterly brilliant... delightful fellow. He's my genius little leprechaun. He's not even my type.

Daddy, please don't.

Daddy, please don't talk to me about this.

Darling...

I'm in awe of you.

I love you so, Jamie... I love you.

I know. I know.

I know.

I'll talk to Mummy again.

Okay, Daddy.

I don't know if you saw it, but you did get a wonderful mention in The New York Times review.

- Oh, really?

- I kept it for you. I thought I could--

I don't wanna see it.

No, it just makes me feel uncomfortable.

But that's so sweet. Thank you.

All right.

How was Monday night?

Monday... No, I don't think

- I want to talk about it.

- Wait.

- What happened on Monday night?

- Nothing.

- Your mother has a suitor.

- No.

Really?

No, please, let's talk about it.

I think it's enough that you are subjected to your father's affair.

So, no, I don't think we need to.

But, speaking of your father,

I do have two performances on Thanksgiving, so...

I'll stay at the theater and you'll eat with him at the apartment with Nina and Alex.

For Nina's sake, let's maintain some semblance of normalcy.

- Doesn't feel normal to me.

- Well, I...

I don't know what to say.

- I'm running late to meet Alexander.

- Oh, come on.

I am. You two clearly have things to speak about.

- No, don't do that.

- No, I'm gonna give you guys space

- to speak about it.

- That's not how we do things.

Grownups don't do that.

- I did make plans with Alexander--

- No. Darling.

We're not leaving like this.

Look at me in the eye.

I can see how cross you are and I don't want you to go like that.

- I'm not cross with you.

- I don't believe you.

Hold on.

I am not angry with you, Mummy.

You're a terrible liar.

- At least you know you can trust me.

- That's true.

- I'm gonna clear.

- No.

- Got to make fun of him...

- I love you.

For not coming to see you yet, rave about your performance.

Well, that'd be wonderful.

Okay, now, tell me about the suitor.

Oh, so, yes, the suitor...

Uh, so...

I was very excited, as you know.

- I was very excited, as you know.

- I do.

- We went out for lunch, not dinner.

- Where?

Café Carlyle, nothing fancy.

And I was a little nervous,

I'll admit, so was he.

So, halfway through the meal, he leans over, and he asks if he can tell me a secret.

- He has a little crush, you see.

- Indeed.

So, I smiled, I blushed a little and I pushed him to tell me.

He has a crush on Mendy and he wants me to introduce them.

- Mendy Wager?

- Mendy.

Don't be so surprised.

Mendy's a very handsome man.

- Felicia...

- There I was... blushing, butterflies all-a-tremble, and...

Well... seems I'm attracted to a certain type.

Listen...

You know, Lenny loves you, he really does.

He's just... a man. A horribly aging man... who cannot just be wholly one thing.

He's just... lost.

I've always known who he is.

He called me, you know.

And?

He wants us all to go to Fairfield for two weeks.

- He sounded different.

- Felicia...

No, I...

Let's not make excuses. He didn't fail me.

- Felicia...

- No, it's...

It's my own arrogance to think I could survive on what he could give.

It's ironic. I would look at everyone, even my children with such pity because of their longing for his attention.

It was sort of a banner

I wore so proudly,

I don't need. I don't need.

And... look at me now.

Who's the one who hasn't been honest?

I miss him... that child of mine.

Any questions?

Bravo!

- It was amazing.

- Darling, why did you come?

There is no hate...

There is no hate in your heart.

- Mr. Bernstein, you can come back now.

- Oh, wonderful.

- Wanna sit down?

- Yes.

You seem like you need your blood pressure taken.

No, I'm fine.

You know Betty's coming for dinner tonight?

- I didn't know that.

- She is.

And Mendy, which will be so nice.

And Julia's gone to go and get fennel, which you know Betty loves.

Come in.

- Hello.

- How are you?

It looks like you have a tumor of the right side of the left breast which may have metastasized to the lung.

Given the size of the tumor,

I would recommend that we remove the breast, the underlying muscles and the adjacent lymph nodes, as well as do a biopsy of the lung which will help us confirm whether there is spread or not.

We could do all of this early next week if you like.

Yes.

But I'm... Darling...

- I'm starting a play in September.

- That's okay.

- No, but I should let them know--

- I'll let them know.

I think your recovery will be faster than you think and we can have you ready within about one to two weeks.

- That's wonderful news.

- You'll be able to do what you need to do.

How can we be assured that we get all the cancer?

- Well--

- ...that we get all the cancer.

We're not gonna compromise on that for the play...

Once we take off the breast, there'll be no local cancer.

We do have to determine about the lung.

How long would the biopsy take?

The biopsy, just minutes, and you'll be sleeping from the other procedure.

So, you do it... you do...

You do both at the same time?

Yeah, we do the breast and it'd be easy to do the biopsy of the lung.

Thank you. Thanks for everything.

- I know...

- I know.

- I know.

- That's so ridiculous.

No, I know.

I'm so ridiculous.

There, there. It's okay, darling.

No, I don't really think so, darling.

- Darling.

- Thank you.

- Darling, let's take the park and walk.

- Really?

Yes.

Yes, let's get some air.

Okay.

- Oh, my God.

- You all right?

No, I'm fine.

- There's something wrong with my knee.

- I have an idea.

Oh, no.

Is that a lighter, darling?

Mind your own business.

I'm thinking of a number.

- Oh, I don't know. Nine.

- No.

- Five.

- No, you have to think.

I'm trying to.

I am trying to.

- It's two, darling.

- Two.

It's two.

- Like us.

- Hmm?

- Like us, a pair.

- Mmm.

Two little ducks in a pond.

Throw your weight on me, darling.

That's it. Put all your weight on me.

Yes, that's it.

Lean your head back. That's it.

Oh, my dear.

Hello, dears.

Hello.

Gorgeous.

Missed you.

Missed you so much.

Mummy? You all right?

I'm good. I'm fine.

Did you have a nightmare getting here?

Of course.

This one was driving.

- Oh, no.

- I don't think we could've gone

- farther east if we'd tried.

- You know I hate driving.

Oh, I wish I'd come earlier. Is there...

Is there anything you need?

Anything I can do?

Never get another perm.

That's what I said.

Ramone said it was a triumph.

It's a gigantic triumph.

Where's Lenny?

Oh, I don't know, he's sleeping or something.

Do you remember that... that bar mitzvah that you dragged me to, one of Alexander's friends?

- The little... Yes.

- I do.

With...

Oh, what's his name?

- Feldman. Yeah.

- Yes!

So, we're there and I am, of course, seated next to our dear Felicia here.

And she looks stunning as usual.

Woe is me.

And Lenny's about 25 pounds lighter.

And tanned, just tanned, all in white from head to toe, including white patent-leather shoes with no socks.

It was very en vogue.

A lie.

Well, at one point Lenny, he gets up, you know, in that all-white attire and he makes his way up to the lectern. Um...

Yes.

No, it's fine. The, um...

- Lenny in the white suit.

- Yes.

And he's all in white... and, um... he...

Uh, he goes up to the lectern and...

- I don't think anybody asked him to speak.

- No.

But... it took him 20 minutes just to walk from our table up there, stopping at every table he passed, chit-chatting of course, and finally, he arrives up there next to the frightened boy.

And Felicia leans up to me without missing a beat and says,

"And now we have the bride."

He's risen.

Oh.

- Oh, my God.

- A production.

Watch it, Jamie.

I'll see you.

Okay. All right, bye. See you.

Love you.

I don't want any more visitors.

No more. No more. I want to go to bed.

Yes, okay.

Yes. No, you're gonna have to cancel it. Yes.

Well...

No, I'm not leaving.

That's out of the question.

I've had a relationship with the orchestra for 15 years, they'll understand.

No, that--

I'm not leaving here, Harry.

You're gonna have to figure it out.

Yes.

Yes, we're doing fine.

- Are you using the bathroom?

- No, I can't.

- You have to drink your water.

- I'm trying.

Oh, my God,

I'm freezing cold all the time.

No, don't help me. I don't need help.

I don't need it. I don't need it.

Let go.

Get into bed, come on.

I don't need all this fuss.

- Are the pillows all right?

- Honestly, they're fine. Come on.

- Just lie down. Lie down.

- Okay.

Sorry. Sorry.

I'm sorry.

You know... all you need... all anyone needs is to be sensitive to others.

Kindness.

Kindness. Kindness.

Darling, it's ten minutes past half hour.

Did you take your medicine?

- No, I don't--

- How's your pain threshold?

I think he told me not to take it.

- Who told you?

- Arkell.

Darling...

No, Arkell's not our doctor.

It's Kruger... Bernard.

Arkell was our doctor many years ago.

Of course, no, I don't know what...

Maybe you should go take some medicine.

How's your pain?

It's fine.

- No pain?

- No.

Okay, well, after this, take it, all right?

- Darling, all right?

- No, I'm concentrating.

Look what I found.

What is it?

- Speaking of childhood memories...

- Oh, yes.

- Could be a good idea.

- More interesting.

- Now, is it?

- Put it on.

Do you remember that song, dear?

- You do?

- Do you guys think we do?

- Do you remember the dance?

- No.

- You were the worst--

- Do you remember the dance?

You were the absolute worst at it.

Come here. Sweet Gene, come here.

Let's go to the house.

Where's the patient?

Where is the patient?

The doctor is here. Hello, nurse.

And, uh...

I love you.

You smell like... tuna fish... and cigarettes.

You caught me.

It's horrible.

- You got it?

- Yeah.

Get the bag.

I think the main point of this whole piece is becoming one.

Not only the timpani in the back, but also the violins in the front.

Have to treat them all as one organism.

If you do that, then you can just work from there.

I've got you. So don't worry.

Okay? I'm right here.

I'm gonna take you through it.

- Okay? Here we go.

- Okay.

William, everybody.

Bar three-eleven, please.

One, two, three.

Okay. Sorry.

Sorry.

Now that you've made it clear that you're retarding into the fermata...

Yeah, I'm just still unclear after--

It's fine, everything's together.

But what happens after?

What are you gonna do?

'Cause they don't know. You gonna bleed out of it or you gonna drip out of it? What are you gonna do?

I'll do this.

Leak out of it.

That's what it sounds like.

Fermata.

- Bar before.

- Bar before.

One, two, three.

No, that's not clear.

Yeah, I didn't feel that.

One more time please. Sorry.

Shall I--

Okay, that's very nice.

But that's still a bar.

So, if I could just show you what I think you wanted

- and if I'm wrong, you tell me.

- Okay.

So think you want to do. Where you want to take it... You have to do... cut off and an upbeat.

Quarters. I think that's what you really mean.

Bar before the fermata.

- Right?

- Yeah.

Did I get it? What did I do?

Ah, that's what I did.

That's for me or for you?

More.

More. More!

That's very good. Okay.

Start back here. Okay, thank you.

Be kind to him.

If summer doesn't sing in you, then nothing sings in you, and if nothing sings in you, then you can't make music.

Something she told me when I was gloomy about something and recited this

Edna St. Vincent Millay poem, which then became Songfest.

But summer does still sing in me.

Not as strongly as it used to or... or as often... but it sure does.

If not, I would've jumped in the lake long ago.

Any questions?

## Past Lives

Who do you think they are to each other?

Hm...

I don't know.

Yeah, this is a hard one.

I think... the white guy and the Asian girl are a couple, and the Asian guy... is her brother.

Or the Asian girl and the Asian guy are a couple, and the white guy is their American friend.

They're not even talking to the white guy.

Maybe they're tourists, and the white guy is their tour guide.

Drinking at 4:00 a.m.?

Yeah, you're right, that makes no sense.

Hm. Maybe they're all just colleagues?

I have no idea.

Hm?

- Hello.

- Hello.

My name is Nora, what's your name?

My name is Michelle.

- How are you, Michelle?

- I'm fine, and you?

- I'm fine, and you?

- I'm fine, and you?

- I'm fine, and you?

- I'm fine, and you?

I'm fine, and you?

I'm fine, and you?

- I'm fine, and you?

- I'm fine, and you?

I'm...

Toronto Pearson

International Airport...

Toronto Pearson...

This is from Korea.

This is our passport, and...

Whoa!

I mean, there's so much in it that... that I responded to.

But the one phrase that sticks with me most...

Mm-hmm.

"The long journey...

- of rotting."

- I liked it too.

We liked how you used the long pauses.

Hm?

Hm...

Uh...

Um...

Oh, shit.

Hm.

— - Hey.

Whoa.

Hm.

Whoa.

Oh...

Hm.

Hm, oh...

Hmm.

Hm.

Hm...

Huh?

Mm.

Hm.

Hm...

Hm.

Hm.

Hm...

[gasps)

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

What did I do?

I love you so much.

I'll do anything to make you happy.

Tell me what you want me to do and I'll do it.

Oh. Huh?

Hi.

Hi! I'm Nora.

I'm Arthur. Nice to meet you.

When'd you get in?

This morning.

- You got the worst room.

- Right? I know.

There is a word in Korean.

In-Yun.

It means "providence."

Or... "fate

But it's specifically about relationships between people.

I think it comes from... Buddhism.

And... reincarnation.

It's an "In-Yun" if two strangers even walk by each other in the street and their clothes accidentally brush.

Because... it means there must have been something between them in their past lives.

If two people get married... they say it's because there have been 8, 000 layers of In-Yun.

Over 8,000 lifetimes.

You believe in that?

Believe what?

That... you and I knew each other in another life.

What, because we're sitting here...

...at the same table, in the same city,

- at the same time?

- Mm-hmm.

Yeah, wouldn't that make this...

In-Yun?

Hm...

- Mm-mm.

That's just something Koreans say to seduce someone.

- Hi.

- Hi.

- Where you going?

- New York City.

- Why're you going there?

- We live there.

- What's your occupation?

- Writers.

- You're what?

- We're writers.

- How long were you visiting Toronto?

- Ten days.

What was the purpose of your visit?

We were visiting her family.

Are you two related?

We're married.

Thanks!

Hey.

"if you bought a ticket to see this show, took the subway or a cab to be here, it cost you something to be here, and spend a couple hours with these old women.

That makes you some kind of immigrant.

And... all this cost me something too.

I crossed the Pacific Ocean to be here.

Some crossings cost more than others.

Some crossings... you pay for with your whole life."

...sit most of the day, and in the end I...

And then I started to write around... after dinner.

Um, yeah, I mean, it's my kind of time.

Uh, but you're studying, right?

Me, too.

I don't know.

- You know what I want?

- What?

Chicken wings.

Holy shit.

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

- Oh, genius. Yes.

- Mm-hmm.

Chicken wings!

Hm...

What're you thinking about?

Remember I told you about Hae Sung?

Oh, yeah. Is that this week?

Yeah.

Why is he coming here again?

I think vacation.

Uh, trunk? Trunk?

Hm.

Hm?

Hm.

- Hi.

- Hi, my love.

How was it?

You were right.

I was?

Yeah.

He came here to see me.

It's so crazy to see him be this grown-up man with a normal job and a normal life.

He's so Korean.

He still lives with his parents, which is really Korean.

And he has all these really Korean views about everything.

And I feel so not Korean when I'm with him.

But also, in some way, more Korean?

It's so weird.

I mean, I have Korean friends, but he's not, like, Korean-American.

He's Korean-Korean.

Is he attractive?

I think so.

He's really masculine in this way that I think is so Korean.

Are you attracted to him?

I don't think so.

I don't know, I mean... I don't think so.

He was just this kid in my head for such a long time.

And then he was just this image on my laptop.

And now he's a physical person.

It's really intense, but I don't think that that's attraction,

I think I just missed him a lot.

I think I miss Seoul.

Did he miss you?

I think he missed the 12-year-old crybaby he knew a long time ago.

- You were a crybaby?

- Yeah.

Most of the time he'd have to just stand there and watch me.

When is he leaving, again?

- The morning after tomorrow.

- Mm-hmm.

Are you mad?

No.

It feels like you are.

I don't have a right to be mad.

What do you mean? Of course you do.

No, I... That guy flew

13 hours to be here.

I'm not gonna tell you that you can't see him or something.

He's your childhood sweetheart.

And it's not like you're gonna run away with him.

Are you?

Definitely.

I'm gonna throw away my life here...

...and run away with him to Seoul.

Do you even know me?

I'm not gonna miss my rehearsals for some dude.

I know.

I know you.

What?

I was just thinking about what a good story this is.

- The story of Hae Sung and me?

- Yeah.

I just can't compete.

What do you mean?

Childhood sweethearts who reconnect 20 years later only to realize they were meant for each other.

- We're not meant for each other.

- I know.

I know.

In the story, I would be the evil white American husband standing in the way of destiny.

Shut up.

Well think about it?

Our story is just so boring.

We met at an artists' residency.

Slept together because we both happened to be single.

We realized we both live in New York, so, we moved in together to save money on rent.

We got married so you could get a green card. So...

- Oh, you make it sound so romantic.

- Right, that's what I'm saying.

I'm the guy you leave in the story when your ex-lover comes to take you away.

He's not my ex-lover.

What if you met somebody else at that residency?

What if there was another writer from New York who had also read all the same books you had, and watched all the same movies, who could give you useful notes on your plays, and listen to you complain about your rehearsals?

- That's not how life works.

- I know.

Yeah.

But wouldn't you be laying here with him?

This is my life, and I'm living it with you.

Are you happy with it?

Is this what you imagined for yourself when you left Seoul?

When I was a 12-year-old?

Yeah. Is this what you pictured for yourself?

Laying in bed in some... tiny apartment in the East Village with some Jewish guy who writes books?

Is that what your parents wanted for you?

You're asking me if you,

Arthur Zaturansky, are the answer to my family's immigrant dream?

- Yeah.

- Wow.

This is where I ended up.

This is where I'm supposed to be.

Okay.

What?

It's just that you make my life so much bigger.

And I'm wondering if I do the same thing for you.

You do.

I'm just a girl from Korea, you know.

And you're forgetting the part where I love you.

I don't forget that. I have trouble believing it sometimes.

Do you know you only speak in Korean when you talk in your sleep?

- I do?

- Yeah.

You never sleep-talk in English.

You only dream in Korean.

- I didn't know that.

- Yeah.

You never told me that.

Well, sometimes I think it's cute.

Sometimes, I don't know,

I guess I get scared.

Scared of what?

You dream in a language that I can't understand.

It's like there's this whole place inside of you where I can't go.

I think that's why I've been trying to learn Korean, even though I know it's annoying for you.

You want to understand me when I'm dreaming?

Yeah.

I'm sure I'm just saying gibberish.

Hm?

Um...

Uh, hi.

Nice to meet you, also.

Uh...

Are you hungry?

-Hm?

- Oh...

Ah, oh. Yes.

Uh...

Pasta?

Pasta? Yeah.

You like pasta?

Yes.

- Okay-

- okay-

- Let's get pasta.

- Pasta.

What did you two do today?

Uh...

The Statue of Liberty.

You took the ferry.

- Yes.

- Yeah.

It's, um, nice.

I've never been.

- What?

- Really?

Yeah, I've never actually been there.

Have we seriously never been there together?

No.

When I was 24 years,

I, uh... Urn...

Oh.

Yes.

- Oh, military service.

- Right.

You know how Korean men have mandatory military service?

Yeah, your dad talks about it. How was it?

You like it?

No.

Uh, but military and work, same.

Same?

Uh, you have, um...

You have a boss.

Hm.

There's no overtime pay in Korea.

It's, uh, very hard.

Hmm. Uh, work. Work is hard.

Hard physically or mentally?

Uh, yes. Uh, both.

Physical, very hard.

- Uh, and, urn...

- Hm. Mentally.

Mentally, I'm strong.

Mm!

Mm.

Hmm.

Hm.

Hm.

He's talking about you.

I'm sorry we speak alone.

Uh, we will stop.

It's okay.

You haven't seen each other in a long time.

I never thought I'd be a part of something like this.

Hm?

Sitting here with you.

Do you know what In-Yun?

Yeah. Nora told me about it when we first met.

You and me.

Yeah. Yeah, you and I are In-Yun too.

Right?

I'm really glad you came here.

It was the right thing to do.

Um, I'm gonna walk him to his Uber.

Okay.

Uh, nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you, too.

Uh, come visit me in Korea.

Definitely.

- I'll be right back.

- Okay.

Hm.

Hm?
