What do you do when you're not sure?
That's the topic of my sermon today.
Last year when
Predisent Kennedy was assassinated,
who among us did not experience
the most profound disorientation?
Despair?
Which way? What now?
What do I say to my kids?
What do I tell myself?
It was a time of people sitting together.
bound together
by a common feeling of hopelessness.
But think of that.
Your bond with your fellow being
was your despair.
It was a public experience.
It was awfuI,
but we were in it together.
How much worse is it then
for the Ione man, the Ione woman,
stricken by a private calamity?
"No one knows I'm sick." "No one
knows I've lost my last real friend."
"No one knows
I've done something wrong."
Imagine the isolation.
Now you see the world
as through a window.
On one side of the gIass,
happy untroubled people,
and on the other side, you.
(SNEEZING)
-God bIess you, Sister.
-Thank you.
I wanna tell you a story.
A cargo ship sank one night.
It caught fire and went down,
and only this one sailor survived.
He found a lifeboat, rigged a sail,
and being of a nautical discipline
tumed his eyes to the heavens
and read the stars.
He set a course for his home,
and, exhausted, fell asleep.
WILLIAM: Just keeps going on.
Clouds roIled in,
and for the next 20 nights,
he could no longer see the stars.
He thought he was on course,
but there was no way to be certain.
And as the days rolled on,
and the sailor wasted away,
he began to have doubts.
-He just keeps on going.
-Had he set his course right?
was he still going on
towards his home?
Or was he horribly lost
and doomed to a terrible death?
No way to know.
The message of the constellations,
had he imagined it because
of his desperate circumstance?
-Or had he seen truth once...
-Straighten up!
...and now had to hold on to it
without further reassurance?
There are those of you in church today
who know exactly
the crisis of faith I describe,
and I wanna say to you,
doubt can be a bond as powerful
and sustaining as certainty.
When you are lost, you are not alone.
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

FrankIin D. RooseveIt, together with

When he assumed office,
 3 miIIion peopIe in this country
were unempIoyed.
They'd Iost hope,
and President RooseveIt
said to these peopIe,
'"The only thing we have to fear
is fear itseIf."
What did he mean by that? James?
I think he was trying to say
there's nothing reaIly wrong.
-You know? So don't get so emotionaI.
-JAMES: Maybe.
Maybe he was saying that
the world is good

WeII, sermons come from somewhere,

Is Father Flynn in doubt?
Is he concerned

I suppose you'd have to ask him.
No, that wouId not be appropriate.
He is my superior,
and if he were troubIed
he shouId confess it to a feIIow priest

We'd do tryouts.
Frosty the Snowman
espouses a pagan beIief in magic.
The snowman comes to Iife when
an enchanted hat is put on his head.
If the music were more somber,
peopIe wouId reaIize the images
are disturbing and the song hereticaI.
I never thought about
Frosty the Snowman Iike that.
It shouId be banned from the airwaves.

WouId you Iike

Not yet.
It's a new time, Sister.
-What's new about it?
-Something inside of peopIe is new.
There is nothing new under the sun.
The Church needs to change.
We shouId sing a song
from the radio now and then,
take the kids out for ice cream.
Sweet tooth.
And maybe take the boys
on a camping trip.
The point being?
We shouId be friendIier.
You know, the chiIdren and the parents
shouId see us
as members of their family.
But we are not members of their family.
We're different.
-Why? Because of our vows?

WeII, I'm a Iittle uncomfortabIe.
-ALO*YSIUS: Why?
-Why do you think?
The boy's weII-being
is my responsibiIity.
(PHONE RINGING)
His weII-being is not at issue.
ALOYSIUS: I'm not satisfied
that that is true.
He was upset
when he returned to class.
-Did he say something?
-No.
What happened in the rectory?
(RINGING CONTINUES)
Happened?
Mmm.
Nothing happened.
I had a taIk with the boy.
-What about?
-Private matter.
He's 1 2 years oId.
What couId be private?
(RINGING CONTINUES)
-ShouId I get. . .
-ALOYSIUS: No.
I object to your tone.
This is not about my tone
or your tone, Father Flynn.
-It's about arriving at the truth.
-Of what?
You know what I'm taIking about,
don't you? Hmm?
And you're controIIing the expression
on your face right now, aren't you?
My face?
What exactly are you accusing me of?
I'm not accusing you of anything,
Father Flynn.
I am asking you to teII me
what happened in the rectory.
I don't wish to continue this.
And if you're dissatisfied with that,
I suggest
you speak to Monsignor Benedict.
I can only imagine this unfortunate
behavior is the resuIt of overwork.
Have a good morning, Sister. Sister.
There was aIcohoI on his breath
when he returned
from his meeting with you.
AlcohoI?
I did smeII it on his breath.
WeII?
-Let this aIone.
-No.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
(STUDENTS CHATTERING)
Take your time, Father.
WouId you Iike some more tea?
You shouIdve Iet it aIone.
Not possibIe.
Mr. McGuinn caught DonaId
drinking aItar wine.
When I found out, I sent for him.
There were tears,
and he begged not to be removed
from the aItar boys. I took pity on him.
I toId him if no one eIse found out,
I'd Iet him stay on.
What a reIief. That expIains everything.
Thanks be to God.
Look, Sister, it was aII a mistake.
And if I taIk to Mr. McGuinn?
TaIk to him, by aII means.
But now that the boy's secret's out,
I'm gonna have to remove him
from the aItar boys.
That's what I was trying to avoid.
JAMES: You were trying
to protect the boy.
That's right.
I might have done the same thing.
Is there a way DonaId couId stay
on the aItar boys?
If the boy drank aItar wine,
he can't continue as an aItar boy.
Of course.
Are you satisfied?
Yes.
Hmm.
WeII, I'II be going.
I have some writing to do.
-ALOYSIUS: IntoIerance.
-That's right.
I'm not pIeased
with how you handIed this.
Sister. Sister.
WeII. . .
What a reIief. He cleared it aII up.
You beIieve him?
Of course.
Isn't it that it's easier to beIieve him?
But we can corroborate his story
with Mr. McGuinn.
Mmm-hmm.
Yes.
These types of peopIe are clever.
-WeII, I'm convinced.
-You're not.
You just want things to be resoIved
so you can have simpIicity back.
I want no further part of this.
(SIGHING)
I'II bring him down.
How can you be so sure
that he is lying?
Experience.
You just don't Iike him.
You don't Iike it
that he uses a baIIpoint pen.
You don't Iike it that he takes
three Iumps of sugar in his tea.
You don't Iike it
that he Iikes Frosty the Snowman,
and you are Ietting that convince you
of something terribIe, just terribIe.
WeII, I Iike Frosty the Snowman!
And I think it wouId be nice
if this schooI weren't run Iike a jaiI,
and I think it's a good thing
that I Iove to teach history
and that I might inspire my students
to Iove it, too.
And if you judge that to mean
that I am not fit to be a teacher,
then so be it!
Sit down.
(LIGHT BULB BLOWS OUT)
Look at that. You bIew out my Iight.
In ancient Sparta, important matters
were decided by who shouted Ioudest.
Fortunately,
we are not in ancient Sparta.
You honestly find the students
in this schooI
to be treated Iike inmates in a prison?
No.
ActuaIly, they aII seem fairly happy,
but they're aII uniformly terrified of you.
Yes. That's how it works.
Sit there.

HeIIo, this is Sister Aloysius Beauvier,

(THUNDER RUMBLING)
FLUNN: A woman was gossiping with
a friend about a man she hardly knew.
I know none of you
have ever done this.
(CONGREGATION CHUCKLING)
That night she had a dream.
A great hand appeared over her
and pointed down at her.
She was immediately seized
with an overwhelming sense of guilt
The next day she went to confession.
She got the old parish prist,
Father O'Rourke.
She told him the whole thing.
"Is gossiping a sin?"
she asked the old man.
"Was that the hand of God Almighty
pointing a finger at me?
"Should I be
asking your absolution, Father?
"TeII me,
have I done something wrong?"
(IMITATING IRISH ACCENT)
"Yes." Father O'Rourke answered her.
"Yes, you ignorant,
badly brought up female.
"You have borne faIse witness
against your neighbor.
"You have played fast and loose
with his reputation,
"and you should be heartily ashamed!"
So the woman said she was sorry
and asked for forgiveness.
"Not so fast," says O'Rourke.
"I want you to go home.
Take a pillow up on your roof,
"cut it open with a knife,
and retum here to me."
So the woman went home,
took a pillow off her bed,
a knife from the drawer,
went up the fire escape to her roof
and stabbed the pillow.
Then she went back
to the old parish priest as instructed.
"Did you gut the pillow with a knife?"
he says.
"Yes, Father."
"And what was the result?"
"Feathers," she said.
"Feathers," he repeated.
"Feathers everywhere, Father."
"Now, I want you to go back
"and gather up every last feather
that flew out on the wind."
"WeII," she said, "it can't be done.
"I don't know where they went.
The wind took them aII over."
"And that," said Father O'Rourke,
"is gossip!"
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
Please rise.
(CROW CAWING)
What's that bird compIaining about?
What kind of bird is that?
That a starling? A grackIe?
-A crow.
-Course it is.
Are you praying?
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I'm not praying. No.
You seem subdued.
Oh, I can't sIeep.
Why not?
Bad dreams.
Yeah, I can't sIeep on occasion.
Why? Do you see that big hand
pointing a finger at you?
Yes. Sometimes.
Was your sermon
directed at anyone in particuIar?
What do you think?
I received a Ietter
from my brother in Marlyand.
He's very sick.
Then maybe you shouId go
and see him.
I can't Ieave my class.
Is it true?
What?
You know what I'm asking.
No.
I saw you put an undershirt
in DonaId MiIIer's Iocker.
-He Ieft it in the sacristy.
-Why didn't you hand it to him?
(SIGHS)
I'm trying to spare him
further embarrassment.
It's me that cares about that chiId,
not her.
Has she ever reached out a hand?
That bIack boy needs heIp
or he's not gonna make it.
If she has her way,
he'II be Ieft to his own undoing.
Why do you think he drank the wine?
He's in troubIe.
And she sees me taIk
in a human way to these kids
and she immediately assumes that
there must be something wrong with it.
WeII, I'm not gonna Iet her
keep this parish in the Dark Ages,
and I'm not gonna Iet her
destroy my spirit of compassion.
I'm sure that's not her intent.
-That I care about this congregation.
-I know you do.
Like you care about your class.
You Iove them, don't you?
-Yes.
-And that's naturaI.
How eIse wouId you reIate to chiIdren?
Now, I can Iook at your face
and know your phiIosophy.
It's kindness.
I don't know. I mean, of course.
There are peopIe
who go after your humanity, Sister,
that teII you that
the Iight in your heart is a weakness.
Don't beIieve it.
It's an oId tactic of crueI peopIe
to kiII kindness in the name of virtue.
There's nothing wrong with Iove.
Love?
Have you forgotten the message
of our Savior?
It's Iove of peopIe.
I just feeI
as if everything is upside down.
(SIGHS)
There are just times in Iife
when we feeI Iost. It happens.
And it's a bond.
-FIowers.
-Yeah.
To remind me of spring.
I shouId be going.
I'm sorry your brother's iII.
Thank you, Father.
I don't beIieve it.
You don't?
No.
Thank you, Sister.
Thank you very much.

Nobody heIp him.
Jimmy, put your hand down.
DonaId MiIIer, stand up.
-What was the question, DonaId?

It means you weren't Iistening.
Yes, Sister.
The question was, what was

I don't know.
"Give me Iiberty or give me death !"
James Hurley,
down to the principaI's office.
Now!
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(SIGHING)
-Mrs. MiIIer?
-Yes.
Come in.
PIease, have a seat.
I was changing a buIb.
Thought I mighta had the wrong day.
You didn't answer.
Huh?
Oh, weII, just between us,
I was Iistening to a transistor radio
with an earpiece.
Look how tiny they're making them.
I confiscated it
from one of the students,
now I can't stop Iistening to it.
You Iike music?
No. News reports.
Years ago I used to Iisten
to aII the news reports,
because my husband was in Italy,
in the war.
-You were a married woman?
-Yes.
But then he was kiIIed.
Is your husband coming?
CouIdn't get off work.
I only have haIf an hour myseIf.
I see. Of course. It was a Iot to ask.
How's DonaId doing?
He's passing his subjects.
He has average grades.
Oh. Good.
He was upset about getting taken off
the aItar boys.
Mmm. Did he expIain why?
He said he was caught
drinking aItar wine.
That is the reason.
WeII, that seems fair.
But he's a good boy, Sister.
He feII down there,
but he's a good boy
pretty much down the Iine.
How is he at home?
His father beat the heII out of him
over that wine.
Oh, he shouIdn't do that.
You don't teII my husband what to do.
You just stand back.
My husband didn't want DonaId
to come here.
-Why?
-He thought he'd have troubIe
with the other boys,
but that hasn't reaIly happened.
Good.
That priest, Father Flynn,
been watching out for him.
Yes.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Excuse me.
James Hurley,
what are you doing out of class?
-Sister James sent me down.
-What for?
-TaIking.
-WeII, go back up and shut up!
Go! Go!
What's going on?
None of your business.
Now go on. Go back to class.
BuIIshit.
-What'd you say?
-Nothing !
You have 20 minutes, you say?
It's just that I have to waIk to work.
-Where is work?
-Parkchester.
If I don't start cleaning by noon,
I'm not home to Iet DonaId in.
-May I waIk with you?
-I don't mind.
JAMES: Eight sixty-fourths.
Who can teII me
what the common denominator is?
Nobody
Back aIready, Mr. Hurley?
-I said, back aIready, Mr. Hurley?
-Leave me aIone!
Who do you think you're taIking to?
This is my classroom, boy!
Don't you forget that.
I'm sorry.
(JIMMY SNIFFLING)
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
ALO*YSIUS: Have you met
Father Flynn?
Just seen him on the aItar.
Haven't met him face to face.
No, just, you know, heard from DonaId.
And what does he say?
You know,
"Father Flynn, Father Flynn."
He Iooks up to him. Man gives him
his time, which is what the boy needs.
He needs that.
Mrs. MiIIer, we may have a probIem.
I thought there must a been a reason
you wanting to see me.
PrincipaI's a big job.
I just want to say though,
it's just tiII June.
Excuse me?
Whatever the probIem is,
DonaId just has to make it tiII June.
Then he's off into high schooI.
Right.
If DonaId can graduate
from St. NichoIas,
he has a better chance
of getting into a good high schooI,
and that wouId mean
an opportunity at coIIege.
I don't see anything at this time
standing in the way
of his graduating with his class.
-WeII, that's aII I care about.
-I doubt that.
Try me.
I am concerned about the reIationship
between Father Flynn and your son.
You don't say. Concerned.
What do you mean, concerned?
That it may not be right.
WeII, there's something wrong
with everbody,
and their souI gotta be forgiven.
I work right there.
I am concerned, to be frank,
that Father Flynn may have made
advances on your son.
May have made?
I can't be certain.
-No evidence?
-No.
Then maybe there's nothing to it.
I think there is something to it.
I think Father Flynn
gave DonaId that aItar wine.
Why wouId he do that?
(SIGHS)
-Has DonaId been acting strangely?
-No.
-Nothing out of the ordinary?
-He's been himseIf.
-AlI right.
-Look, Sister, I don't want any troubIe.
I don't. . . I'm not sure
you compIetely understand.
I think I understand
the kind of thing you're taIking about,
but I don't want to get into it.
What's that?
Look, I only have a few minutes.
Not to be disagreeing,
but if we're taIking about
something floating around
between this priest and my son,
it ain't my son's fauIt.
-I'm not suggesting that. . .
-He's just a boy.
-I know.
-TweIve years oId.
If someone shouId be taking bIame,
it shouId be the man. . .
-I know. I agree with you compIetely.
-. . .not the boy.
You're agreeing with me,
but I got caIIed
to the principaI,
if you know what I'm saying.
I am concerned about DonaId's weIfare.
You honestly think that priest
gave DonaId that wine to drink?
Yes, I do.
Then how come my son
got kicked off the aItar boys
-if it was a man that gave it to him?
-I know.
The boy got caught, the man didn't.
-So you're giving my son the bIame.
-No.
No probIem my son getting bIamed,
-and you know why that is.
-Perhaps you shouId Iet me taIk.
-I think you're getting upset.
-Sister, you ain't going against
no man in a robe and win.
He's got the position.
-And he's got your son.
-Let him have him then.
What?
It's just tiII June.
Do you know what you're saying?
Know more about it than you.
I beIieve this man is creating,
or may have aIready brought about,
an improper reIationship with your son.
I don't know.
I know I am right.
Why you gotta know something
Iike that for sure when you don't?
What kind of mother are you?
Excuse me, but you don't know enough
about Iife to say a thing Iike that, Sister.
I know enough.
You know the ruIes maybe,
but that don't cover it.
I know what I won't accept.
You accept what you gotta accept,
and you work with it.
This man is in my schooI.
WeII, he's gotta be somewhere and
-maybe he's doing some good, too.
-He is after the boys!
WeII, maybe some of them boys
want to get caught!
That's why his father beat him.
Not the wine.
What are you teIIing me?
I'm taIking about the boy's nature now,
not anything he's done.
You can't hoId a chiId responsibIe
for what God gave him to be.
I'm only interested in actions,
Mrs. MiIIer.
But then there's the boy's nature.
-Leave that out of it.
-WeII, forget it then.
You're the one
forcing peopIe to say things.
My boy came to your schooI
'cause they were gonna kiII him
in the pubIic schooI.
His father don't Iike him.
He come to your schooI,
kids don't Iike him.
One man is good to him, this priest.
Then does a man
have his reasons, yes.
Everbody does.
You have your reasons,
but do I ask the man
why he's good to my son?
No.
I don't care why.
My son needs some man
to care about him
and to see him through
to where he wants to go.
And thank God this educated man
with some kindness in him
wants to do just that.
-This wiII not do.
-It's just tiII June.
I'II throw your son out of this schooI.
And why wouId you do that
if it didn't start with him?
Because I wiII stop this.
You'd hurt my son to get your way?
-It won't end with your son.
-Throw the priest out then.
-I am trying to do just that.
-Then what do you want from me?
Nothing.
(SIGHING)
As it turns out.
(CRYING) PIease Ieave my son
out of this.
My husband wiII kiII that chiId
over a thing Iike this.
I wiII try.
I'm Iate.
Sister,
I don't know if you and me
on the same side.
I'II be standing with my son
and those who are good with my son.
It'd be nice to see you there.
Good morning.
May I come in?
A third party wouId be required.
Yeah. What was DonaId's mother
doing here?
-We were having a chat.
-About what?
A third party
wouId truly be required, Father.
No, Sister. No third party!
Me and you are due for a taIk!
You have to stop
this campaign against me.
-You can stop it at any time.
-How?
Confess and resign.
You are attempting
to destroy my reputation !
Who keeps opening my window?
What are you doing in this schooI?
I'm trying to do good.
Even more to the point,
what are you doing in the prieasthood?
You are singIe-handedly hoIding
this schooI and this parish back.
-From what?
-Progressive education
and a weIcoming church.
You can't distract me, Father.
This is not about my behavior,
it's about yours.
No, this is about
your unfounded suspicions.
-That's right. I have suspicions.
-Just Ieave that. It's not important.
I wiII decide
what's important.
Why do you suspect me?
What have I done?
You gave that boy wine,
and you Iet him take the bIame.
That's compIetely untrue.
Did you taIk to Mr. McGuinn?
AlI McGuinn knows
is that the boy drank wine.
He doesn't know
how he came to drink it.
Did his mother
have something to add to that?
No.
-So that's it.
-I am not satisfied.
Ask the boy then.
-He'd protect you.
-Why wouId he do that?
-Because you have seduced him.
-You're insane.
You've got it in your head
that I corrupted this chiId
after giving him wine,
and nothing I say wiII change that.
That's right.
But this has nothing to do
with the wine.
Not reaIly. You've had a fundamentaI
mistrust of me before this incident.
It was you that warned Sister James
to be on the Iookout, wasn't it?
That's true.
-So you admit it!
-Certainly.
Why?
I know peopIe.
That's not good enough.
-It won't have to be.
-How's that?
You wiII teII me what you have done.
Oh, I wiII.
Out again.
Sister James is convinced I'm innocent.
So you taIked to Sister James.
WeII, of course
you taIked to Sister James.
Did you know
DonaId's father beats him?
Yes.
And might that not account
for the odd behavior
Sister James noticed in the boy?
It might.
Then what is it? What?
(STAMMERING) What did you hear?
What did you see
that convinced you so thoroughly?
What does it matter?
It matters! What does it matter?
I want to know!
Out this window,
I saw you grab WiIIiam London's wrist,
and I saw him puII away.
-Are you serious?
-I am.
That's aII?
Yeah. That was aII.
That's nothing.
-What are you doing now?
-I'm writing down what you say.
It might be important when I have
to expIain why you have to be removed.
This morning before I spoke
with Mrs. MiIIer,
I took the precaution
of caIIing your Iast parish.
What did he say?
-Who?
-The pastor.
I did not speak to the pastor.
I spoke to a nun.
You shouId have spoken to the pastor.
I spoke to a nun.
You know that's not the proper route
for you to have taken, Sister.
The church is very clear. You're
supposed to go through the pastor.
Why? You have an understanding,
you and he?
No, you have no right to go rummaging
through my past!
You have a history.
This is your third parish in five years.
-Why?
-CaII the pastor.
Ask him why I Ieft.
It's perfectly innocent.
-I'm not caIIing the pastor.
-I'm a good priest.
Go after another chiId and
another chiId, untiI you are stopped.
-What nun did you speak to?
-I won't say.
-Yeah, I've not touched a chiId.
-You have!
You haven't the sIightest proof
of anything.
But I have my certainty.
And armed with that,
I'II go to your Iast parish
and the one before that.
If necessary, I'II find a parent.
Trust me, Father Flynn, I wiII.
You have no right to act on your own !
You have taken vows,
obeience being one!
You answer to us!
You have no right
to step outside the church !
I wiII step outside the church
if that's what needs to be done,
though the door shouId shut
behind me!
I wiII do what needs to be done,
though I'm damned to heII !
You shouId understand that,
or you wiII mistake me.
Now, did you give DonaId MiIIer
wine to drink?
Have you never done anything wrong?
-I have.
-No mortaI sin?
Yes.
And?
I confessed it, Father.
Then whatever I have done,
I have Ieft in the heaIing hands
of my confessor.
As have you.
We are the same.
Mmm-mmm.
No, we are not. We are not the same.
A dog that bites is a dog that bites.
Did you give DonaId MiIIer
wine to drink?
No.
MentaI reservations?
No.
You Iie.
Very weII then.
If you wiII not Ieave my office, I wiII.
And once I go, I wiII not stop.
FLYNN: Wait.
(ALO*YSIUS SIGHS)
I can't say everything, you understand?
There's things I can't say,
even if you can't imagine
the expIanation, Sister.
(SIGHING)
Remember, there are things
beyond your knowledge.
Even if you feeI certainty,
it is an emotion, not a fact.
You wiII request a transfer
and take a Ieave of absence
untiI it's granted.
You'd Ieave me nothing.
It's DonaId MiIIer who has nothing,
and you took fuII advantage of that.
I've done nothing wrong.
I care about that boy.
Why?
'Cause you smiIe at him?
And you sympathize with him?
And you taIk to him
as if you were the same?
You are a cheat.
And that warm feeIing you experienced
when that boy Iooked at you with trust
was not the sensation of virtue.
That couId be got by any drunkard
with his tot of rum.
I can fight you.
You wiII Iose.
Where's your compassion?
Nowhere you can get at it.
Stay here. Compose yourseIf.
You can use the phone if you'd Iike.
Good day, Father.
I have no sympathy for you.
I know you are invuInerabIe
to true regret.
And cut your naiIs.

I never like to say goodbye,
but there is a wind behind every one
of us that takes us through our lives.
We never see it. We can't command it.
we don't even know its purpose.
'Cause I would have stayed
among you longer.
but that wind is taking me away.
I wiII miss it here,
and I will miss you.
But I'm content that the power
that propels me
does so with superior knowledge
as to what is for the best,
and that is my faith.
I would Iike to come down now
among you
and say goodbye
and wish you peaceful hearts
and loving hearts.

What do you want to do?
Something huge.
There's nothing huge
around here.
You took your dad's car?
Just a little spin, man.
 I've been waiting
All these years 
 Somebody holds the key 
 But I'm near the end 
 And I just ain't got
The time 
 And I'm wasted
And I can't find my way home 
Hey, can I
hitch a ride?
Oh.
Shit! Get out of here!
Get out of here right now!
 My way home 
Shit.
Shit. Shit.
Jon...
Jon, shh.
I gotta go.
This is where
you live.
This is all fucked up.
 I can't find my way home 
Hey.
I guess we
let things get...
I mean...
It's just love, man.
It's just...love.
We got carried away,
and I think we should stop.
I mean, pretty soon,
we'll be out
of high school,
and then we'll be in college,
and I want to go to college
in a big city.
You're gonna go away?
As soon as I can.
You're awake.
I just...
Um, I wanted
a drink of water.
I couldn't sleep either,
so I decided
I might as well
do something useful.
Maybe I shouldn't
stay here anymore.
I'm not innocent
in all this, Bobby.
I can't pretend to be.
I honestly don't
know what to do.
I'm supposed
to be the mother.
I'm the adult here.
And I honestly don't...
have the slightest idea
what to do or say
to either one of you.
I should go...
I guess.
Want to learn how to bake a pie?
Huh?
Sometimes it's good
to just do a simple,
useful thing.
I don't know.
Well, I haven't rolled out
the second crust yet.
It's not like
bread dough.
You mold that until
it comes to life.
Pie crust is
just the opposite.
It needs kid gloves.
You handle it
as little as possible.
You'd be surprised
how easy it is
once you learn
a few of the tricks.
Just coax it.
That's right.
That's good.
That's very good.

Was the love you gave 
 All I needed

It was...a trip.

Me too. You.
Thanks for letting me, you know,
crash here for a while.
Well, come on.
Grab your things,
get settled in.
Come, Jonathan.
Wow.
I like a little respite
from all the dÃ©cor.
You want to...
go out to dinner?
You want to unpack first?
I mostly brought,
you know, records.
Let's go out.
Okay.
Have fun, boys.

You come too.
Well, I...
No.
You guys need
a little time alone,
I think.
No, really.
Come.
Okay.
I'll just put on my other eye,
and we're out of here.

up to Central Park.

you'll have the whole city
figured out.

What?
You got a tattoo.
Oh.
Yeah, years ago at NYU.
I thought I could be
the kind of person
who'd have a tattoo.
Cool.
Bobby...
Uh-huh?
I feel like there are things
we should talk about...
but I'm not sure what to say.
What things?
[LAUGHS]
You know, when we were kids...
What we used to do.
Oh.
Man, we were kids.
So, um...
are you seeing anyone
in Cleveland?
Nah.
I was just, you know,
working, hanging out.
How about you?
You seeing anybody?
No.
No one in particular.
[]
Hey, man.
Look what someone
was throwing out.
Hey, Leonard C.
Right out there
on the street
along with some
dead spider plants
and macramÃ©.
How many times
did we get stoned
to this?
I lost count.
Hey, man,
I'm making lasagna.
We could knock off
a bottle of Chianti
and listen to "Suzanne,"
like, 10 times.
Sorry, I've got
a date.
No problemo.
Save some for me.
Uh-huh.
You have to promise
to make this,
at most, once a year.
Bobby, if I weigh
300 pounds,
I won't be able
to get up the stairs.
Too bad Jonathan
has to miss it.
Well...Jonathan
has other priorities.
And it was the best.
We were out of our minds.

You had a good time?
Oh, the best.
The best.
You know how sometimes it seems
like the DJ knows you?
Uh-huh.
That's what
I'm talking about.

 Suzanne takes you down... 
This is
one of my sadness albums.
After my divorce.
You were married?
Years ago.
He was a sadistic drug addict,
and I was, um...
well, a masochistic
aspiring drug addict.
It made sense
at the time.
Where did you meet him?
Want a real laugh? Woodstock.
You were at Woodstock?
Like...the concert?
Well, I don't tell just anybody,
Bobby.
What was it like?
Muddy.
You never seen so much mud.
I felt like a pig.
I was attracted to Denny
because he had a huge bar
of Lifebuoy soap
down at the pond.
Yow.
Hey.
Have you ever heard Steve Reich?
No.
It's one of my favorites.
Listen.

to blow through.

You're home early.
Yeah, I was having

Well, as you know,

Love that.
Jon, Jonnie,
have you heard this guy?
Steve Reich.
Oh. Sure.
He's great. He's amazing.
He's just... He's...
Where'd you find him,
anyway?
He found me.
[LAUGHS]
Well, he's
a welcome addition
to the household.
Bobby, you're gonna have to
find a job, aren't you?
Well, I'm a baker.
You think a New York bakery
would hire me?
Honey, in New York,
someone will pay you
to do just about anything.
I mean, if I can make a living
making hats...
She doesn't exactly
make a living making hats.
She picks up a little change
that way.
That is not true.
I do have some money left over
from my grandfather,
but I've stashed it away
for when the baby comes.
You're having a baby?
Didn't Jonathan
tell you?
It, uh...
It hasn't come up.
I didn't know you two were, um--
Lovers? We're not.
Most parents aren't lovers.
Mine weren't.
I know this must sound
a little...
A little what,
darling?
A little free?
A little great?
A little like insisting
on our own happiness,
even if it's not what
people ordinarily do?
Well...
Babies.
I mean, hey,
let's have a dozen.
[BOTH LAUGH]
Shit, you scared me.
Sorry, man.
What are you doing?
I get up and walk around
in the dark sometimes.
Does that
weird you out?
No.
I don't know.
When the place is all dark...
When you and Clare
have gone to sleep,
and I'm awake...
it's like being alive
and being dead
at the same time.
You know?
It's this sort of
halfway thing,
where the people who are alive
are dreaming,
and the people who are dead
are...
where they are.
And I'm here...
in the dark and the quiet.
You want some water?
Sure.
[SIGHS]
Hey...
Are you and Clare
really having a baby?
Oh, God.
I don't know.
We've been
talking about it.
It's something
she really wants.

I like Clare.
So do I.
[CAR HORN HONKS]
Bye, Lacey.
See you.
We can take it from
there if we need to...
Perfect.
And on the Thursday ad--
Oh, shit, I gotta go.
Can you, uh--?
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
Thank you.
Bye, Jonathan.
Bye.
MAN:
"Don't let it worry you,"
said the cameraman.
"Even De Mille
couldn't see anything
looking through
the wrong end,"
so that was
the first--
Don't let me
kill the point.
Or isn't it a story
for grown-ups?
You've heard it.
About the time
I looked
through the wrong end
of the camera finder.
Remind me to tell you
about the time
I looked into the heart
of an artichoke.
Hey...
is your name Dirk?
No, I'm Jonathan.
Oh. I'm sorry, I just...
you look like
someone I know named Dirk.
I'm Wes.
JONATHAN: Hey, Wes.
These are my friends,
Clare...
and Bobby.
Pleasure, Wes.
Hey.
So, Jonathan,
Bobby and I'll
see you later.
I thought we were all
having dinner together.
All right.
I'll see you later.
Yow.
Do you know what I think?
Now, can Clare be
absolutely honest with you?
Uh-huh.
I think you need
a new haircut.
Really?
Mm. You're so handsome,
and that hippie do
does absolutely
nothing for you.
I don't know.
I never really,
you know,
think about it.
Well, I do.
See, here's the thing.
You don't quite
look like yourself this way.
You know
what I'm saying?
If you walk around looking like
someone other than who you are,
you could end up getting the
wrong job, the wrong friends,
who knows what all.
You could end up
with someone else's whole life.
I think this is my life.
It doesn't seem
like somebody else's.
Check.
 They can't hurt you now 
 Can't hurt you now 
 Can't hurt you now 
 Because the night
Belongs to lovers 
 Because the night
Belongs to lust 
 Because the night... 
What do you think?
I look so...
Dangerous?
Sexy?
Stripped-down,
ready for action?
That's not what I was thinking,
exactly.
Well, you are definitely
gonna start turning heads
around here now.
Bobby...
What do you like
about me?
What?
Do you...
Do you like me?
I like you.
Of course I like you.
I mean, could you...
You know, do you have...
God, I can't believe
you're gonna
make me say it.
Do you think I'm attractive?
Oh. I, uh...
That's what I thought
you were gonna ask.
And, yes, I...
Absolutely, I do.
Good.
That's good.
Well...
there's just no smooth
or sophisticated way to do this,
is there?
Clare...
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
No, listen.
You talk too much, darling,
and if you don't shut up,
I will come to my senses
and realize
how utterly stupid
and self-destructive
this is.
I have to tell you,
I've never...
you know,
done this before.
Pardon me?
I've never...
you know...
Never?
No.
Does that freak you out?
No.
I mean, yes, of course
it freaks me out!
Jesus Christ.
I guess maybe
we should stop.
Maybe.
Because, you know...
I may not be the most, like...
adept.
Oh, honey.
You think I'm upset
because you might not be adept?
Is that
what you think?
No.
I guess.
Okay...junior.
Mama's gonna teach you
a thing or two.
Are you nervous?
Uh-huh.
Don't be.
This is the most natural thing
in the world.
All right.
[GRUNTS]
[SOBBING]
It's all right.
[DOOR OPENS]
JONATHAN [MUFFLED]:
Hey!
Sorry I missed dinner.
Where is everybody?
[]
[DOOR SLAMS]
Hey.
Jonnie...
Are you okay?
Mm-hmm.
Are you okay?
I guess.
You should go back
to Clare.
Nah, man.
I don't want to
leave you alone.
I mean...
[EXHALES SLOWLY]
You should...
go back to Clare.
Really.
Bobby?
[]
Hey.
Bobby, wakey, wakey.
Oops!
I am not here.
You never saw me.
I'm just the cleaning lady.
So sorry.
You were in bed.
We tucked you in
at 2 a.m.
I went out again.
Fun?
Sort of.
Potential?
I don't think so.
[PEOPLE CONVERSING
IN HUSHED TONES]
[SIGHS]
So, what'll we
do now--? Oops.
See you later, babies.
Jonnie...
Oh, it's
entirely fine.
There's a whole world
full of art boys just outside.
Jonathan...
No worries.
Love you.
[MOZART'S "SOAVE SIA IL VENTO"
PLAYING]
Hey, man.
What are you doing
up here?
Some queen next door's
got Mozart cranked.
I couldn't
tear myself away.
Opera, huh?
Clare loves you.
I love Clare.
Doesn't this all seem
sort of strange?
No, man.
It's perfect.
Just like this.
Bobby, I'm starting
to feel a little extra.
You're essential, man.
[CHUCKLES]
Mm-mm.
Hey. Let's dance.
You can't dance
to opera.
You can dance to anything.
What are you doing?
A little kiss
between brothers.
Nothing wrong
with that.
Jon?
Jonnie?
Clare! Clare, wake up!
What?
[SIGHS]
[WHISPERS]
Jonathan...
you asshole!
God.
We gotta find him.
Honey, he isn't lost.
He left.
It's my fault.
This is not true.
No, you don't...
You don't understand.
Shh.
Bobby, this is a problem
of Jonathan's.
Trust me.
There's something
fucked up about me.
There is nothing fucked up
about you.
You don't know.
ALICE: Hello?
Hi, Alice?
Bobby,
is that you, honey?
Listen,
I don't want to worry you,
but I was wondering,
have you heard from Jonathan?
Oh, yeah, of course.
He's right here.
Do you want
to talk to him?
He's there?
Great. Yeah, put him on.
Bobby, I'm sorry.
It looks like he's
gone to bed already,
but I'll tell him
you called, okay?
Tell him Clare and I
are fine, okay?
Okay, sweetheart,
I will.
Bye-bye.
[DUNCAN SHEIK'S
"SOMETHING SOMEWHERE" PLAYING]
 Still, you're near 
 Still, you call 
 The fears and sighs 
 I hear them all 
 Like those Christmastimes 
 When we would not sleep 
 Just lay there
Warm and proud 
 All your wishes
For something somewhere 
 And it's never far 
 Oh, what all we were 
 All that's changing now 
 All your wishes
For something somewhere 
 Through this different town 
 With its different streets 
 Still, the thought of you 
Do you like it here?
Well...
here I can...
more or less,
breathe the air.
And your mother's
learned
how to make
blue margaritas.
[LABORED BREATHING]
Whoever expected to end up
living in the desert?
Yeah, whoever expects
to end up living anywhere?
That's...too deep for me.
 Something somewhere 
 And what's left behind 
 When each evening ends? 
 Roads to where we've been 
 All your wishes... 
How's that?
Looks a little bit
like me, doesn't it?
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
We're not speaking
to anybody right now.
[ANSWERING MACHINE CLICKS]
BOBBY'S VOICE:
Happy holidays.
Celebrate,
all you people.
[MACHINE BEEPS]
ALICE:
Hello, Bobby.
This is Alice.
Sweetheart, there's something
I have to tell you.
 All your wishes
For something somewhere 
Oh, look at you.
And this is Clare.
Oh, Clare.
So wonderful
to finally meet you.
Thanks for coming.
Thank you
for having me.
Alice, sorry.
[DISHES CLATTERING]
Alice?
So clumsy.
I'll get it.
Oh, it's all right.
They cost $1.at K-Mart.
Oh...
[DISH SHATTERS]
Alice?
Do something for me.
Anything.
Hold me.
Just hold me.
Okay.
Tighter.
Don't be gentle with me.
Squeeze me harder.
Harder.
Make me feel like
you're breaking my ribs.
Oh, God...
I can't.
I don't wanna hurt you.
I love you.
You're an angel.
JONATHAN: Mom?
I'll be right there,
honey.
JONATHAN:
Anybody want a drink?
BOBBY: Okay, sure.
CLARE: Okay.
Hey.
I'm sorry about--
Well...all this.
I, uh...
I knew I'd see you both again.
I just imagined...
well...
different circumstances.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Ned, man.
He was a trip.
He was like
my father too.
You would have
loved him, Clare.
CLARE:
I'm sure.
Bobby?
If you want my family so badly,
I hereby bequeath them to you.
No. No, better yet,
I hereby bequeath you
my whole, entire life.
Be me.
I hereby dub you
Jonathan Glover.
Tomorrow, when they cremate
my father's body,
you can be the son,
and I'll be
the best friend.
You can come back
from the service
and you can console my mother.
Jonathan, stop it.
Stop it.
You're better at it than I am.
You're better qualified.
So go, go at it.
Be their son,
with my blessings.
Listen to me,
you little shit.
All he's ever done
is worship you,
and all you've ever done
is walk out on him.
Don't you dare
speak to him like that,
you hear me?
You don't know
what you're talking about.
You don't know the first thing
about worship.
Do you know?
Do you have any idea
how much I...
Listen, you guys--
How much
I wanted you?
How much I loved you,
you asshole?
You know?
And then, what an idiot I am,
how pathetic is that?
Me in love
with you.
And then Bobby
comes along,
and I fall in love
with this one,
and then I think
that we...
That the three of us,
maybe we could...
[SOBS]
Fuck it.
JONATHAN: Clare?
Just leave me alone
and go back to the house
and have a drink.
Clare!
Clare...
How could you?
Just leave
without saying anything?
I couldn't be
the uncle anymore.
Give me a break, okay?
Clare, hey...
Don't call me that.
What? Don't call
you what? Your name?
What did you think
I would do
without you,
Jonathan?
What were you
thinking?
BOBBY:
Oh, Clare, come on.
I'm pregnant, you fuckers!
What?
Are-- Are you sure?
I'm completely sure.
You wanted this.
Didn't you?
God help me.
Clare... Oh, man.
You think?
Yes.
Yes.
[LAUGHING AND CRYING]
[]
JONATHAN: What do you think
about "Ethan" for a boy?
Or "Trevor"?
CLARE: Let's not
get too fancy.
If it's a girl,
let's call her "Clare, Jr."
One Clare per family
is enough, thank you.
What's the kid gonna
call Bobby and me?
Oh, I never
thought of that.
"Daddy," I suppose.
Like, "Daddy One"
and "Daddy Two?"
 Oooooh-oooh-ooh 
 Oooooh-oooh-ooh 
 Oooooh-oooh-ooh 
 Oooooh 
CLARE: We're gonna
have to move, aren't we?
JONATHAN: Right.
Funny family
will need a third bedroom.
Frankly,
I think funny family
may need a whole
new neighborhood.
JONATHAN:
Somewhere where two
out of three people passing by
are not actively psychotic?
Exactly.
BOBBY:
How about Cleveland?
No!
No!
BOBBY:
Let's move here.
Please repeat
what you just said.
It's too hard to raise
a kid in the city.
Don't you think?
But what if the kid
turned out to be
some sort of,
I don't know, Heidi.
I mean, how much
goodness do we want?
Growing up in the country
doesn't doom anyone
to good behavior.
Most of the really
interesting murderers
come from derelict
farms.
This is so adult,
looking at real estate.
We are adults,
sort of.
JONATHAN:
Who would the kid play with
way out here?
CLARE:
Maybe woodland creatures,
like Snow White did.
I don't want him hanging
around with squirrels.
They have personality
disorders.
CLARE:
Stop it!
This one has a great soul.
Don't you
think?
Baby?
It's your money.
It's my grandfather's money.
I didn't earn a dime of it.
Still...
you'd be the owner.
What do you think?
You really want this,
don't you?
Um...if you do.
If we all do.
No, you, Bobby Morrow.
Beautiful, crazy boy.
You want this,
and I could get it for you.
No, it'd be
for us.
[DUSTY SPRINGFIELD'S
"WISHIN' AND HOPIN'" PLAYING]
So long,
treasures.
 Wishin' and hopin'
And thinkin' and prayin' 
 Plannin' and dreamin'
Each night of his charms 
 That won't get you
Into his arms 
 So if you're looking
To find love you can share 
 All you gotta do is hold him
And kiss him and love him 
 And show him that you care 
 Show him that you care
Just for him 
[DOOR OPENS]
I'm thinking white here.
Totally white,
like a Shinto shrine,
and somewhere we can hang
paper lanterns all over.
You are the gayest
living human being ever.
Somebody's gotta be gay
around here.
What do you like,
Bobby?
I think I'm gonna go...
and fix a window.
Okay, Jonathan...
blue is your friend.
See, blue is the color
of sky and water.
Yeah, but white goes
with everything.
Yes, well, honey,
it's a house,
not an outfit.
 So if you're thinkin'
Of how great true love is 
 All you gotta do is hold him
And kiss him and squeeze him 
 And love him 
 Yeah, just do it
And after you do 
 You will be his 
 You will be his 
 You will be his 
[BABY CRYING]
It's all right.
I'll do it.
No, sleep. It's my night.
It's okay.
Bobby's doing it.
It's his night.
If we don't keep
to the schedule,
you know,
then we'll all
be exhausted
by tomorrow.
I don't care.
I miss my daughter.
BOBBY:
Guess nobody's
sleeping tonight.
JONATHAN:
Hello, Rebecca.
Hello.
Oh.
Aw.
Oh...
Oh, sweetie...
[COOING]
Who's a girl?
[HONKS]
Hey, beauties
and heroes.
Where have you been?
Come with me.
I got something
to show you.
This town's crying out
for a cool, little cafÃ©.
CLARE:
This town's crying out
for an outlet mall.
[JONATHAN & CLARE LAUGH]
What?
It has possibilities.
Where?
Point out
a possibility.
Kitchen's
basically okay.
Just needs
a good cleaning.
Look, wood
floors.
Is that a termite?
No--
Oh, uh, yeah,
maybe.
I think I got a name.
"The Home CafÃ©."
What do you think?
Well, it'd be
better for business
than "The Squalor
and Desperation CafÃ©,"
I suppose.
And the goddess said,
"Feed the people
and send them out happy
into the night."
How's that mushroom lasagna
holding up?
Two more orders left.
Save 'em
for Martha and Gill.
No problem.
You got 'em, my dears.
Thanks,
Jonathan.
[BABY CRYING]
We're home, dear.
Oh, she's not
happy today.
For a full hour.
I have no idea.
Oh, hey, honey.
Aw.
Just feeling shitty?
I think she's
getting sick.
I gotta get dressed
and get back to the restaurant.
Yeah, and I
have to, well,
pick up some toys.
You okay?
Never better.
[CARTOON VOICE]
Come on.
I seem to have ended up
the mother and the wife,
haven't I?
That's not fair.
No, that's not fair.
And I can't help that.
[DOOR OPENS]
I thought you'd be
out here.
I'm sorry.
You haven't
done anything.
I just want everybody
to be happy.
I know you do.
It won't always be like this.
We're, you know,
still getting started.
Bobby, what if I...
just couldn't do this?
It'll be okay.
Trust me.
You know, I think maybe
I'm not...this unusual.
I think maybe
it's just my hair.
[QUIETLY]
I love your hair.
Come here.
Oh, Bobby.
Oh, mamacita!
Here you are.
Oh, look what you've done.
Our little place.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Oh, that's Ned and me.
Where did you find this?
Oh, it's lovely,
all of it.
Oh.
I want to see
the kitchen.
Come on.
ALICE:
Oh, I love it!
CLARE: So here it is.
Yasgur's Farm.
The holy ground itself.
It's hard
to believe
all that went on
here, isn't it?
It just
looks like...
Mud puddle
and a field of cow pies?
I know.
Come on in,
you people!
No.
I have been
in that water before--
Bobby, don't you dare
put her in there!
[SMALL SPLASH]
[LAUGHS]
Boys, give 'em
a puddle to play in...
ALICE:
They're sweet together,
aren't they?
In their gooney way.
I think
you're very brave.
You do?
Yeah.
When I was
your age,
you got married,
and you had a family.
Never occurred to you
to do anything else.
Well, you know, I wanted that.
I wanted...
just a more normal thing,
when I was younger.
Just wanted a husband
and a baby and...
I think maybe you're better off.
Really.
One minute you think
you have everything
you ever wanted,
and the next you...
find yourself
in some suburban neighborhood
somewhere...
and it's fine.
I mean, it's not not fine.
It's just...
The world just...
starts to shrink
around you somehow.
Most women
have absolutely no idea
what they're getting into.
No.
I don't suppose anyone knows
what they're getting into...
till they're into it.
[REBECCA LAUGHING]
[DOOR OPENS]
Whoops.
For God's sake.
Hey, what's up?
A little privacy, please.
You never wanted
privacy before.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
What's that?
It's nothing.
Come here.
It's...
[VOICE QUAVERING]
one of those spots,
I think.
Nah, man.
It's a bruise.
Maybe.
Absolutely.
Will you...
Will you do something for me?
Sure.
Don't tell them.
I can't--
If I'm sick--
You're not sick.
I-- Well, just promise me that,
then, okay?
If it's just a bruise--
It is a bruise.
If I just bumped my hip,
then there's no reason
to mention it, okay?
It is a bruise.
Okay, there is no reason
to talk about it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
[KNOCKING]
Mom, is that--?
Your father's ashes.
I thought there'd be
a right moment,
and now suddenly
if I don't give 'em
to you right now,
I'm gonna have to take them
back to Phoenix with me.
He wouldn't
have wanted them
scattered in Arizona.
I thought maybe
we could scatter them here.
Here?
Well, this is
your home, isn't it?
I guess.
You know,
I think it might be best
just to be done with it.
He was a...
A modest man.
He wouldn't have wanted
an elaborate ceremony.
Mom.
And I can
tell you this.
This is no more him
than a pair
of his old shoes.
Not yet. I'm...
Not here, not now.
I'm... I'm not ready.
Well...whenever you are.
We should go.
Okay.
I love you, honey.
I love you too.
BOBBY: I'll see you
at the cafÃ©.
ALICE: Bye!
[LAUGHING]
Oh, no, did you
get yourself dirty?
Did you?
You got yourself
so dirty.
I need powder.
Did you get yourself
dirty?
I know you did.
You're so sexy
like this.
And you are
a true pervert.
Get me the powder.
Who's a girl?
Who's a girl?
What happened?
You got something
on your face.
Here, let me.
Hey.
[GURGLES]
[LAUGHS]
You can do anything,
can't you?
Me? Nah.
I mean it. You can live
in the suburbs,
in the East Village,
you can live in the country,
and it just doesn't make
any difference to you, does it?
I don't know.
I never really think about it.
There you go.
All done.
Come on.
Thanks.
Come here.
Sit up there, princess.
You are a strange
and mysterious creature.
I'm, like, the least
mysterious one around here.
I'll bet you could live
in the Sahara.
I bet you could
just pitch a tent
and find someone
to sell you a camel.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
I mean it.
Is there anything
you couldn't do?
I couldn't be alone.
No.
No, you couldn't, could you?

about it.
No worries, please.

It's the same.
Let me see.

Can be replaced 
 Yes, every distance
Is not near 
See?
It's the same.
No, man.
It's fading.
 So I remember every face 
You really think so?
Absolutely.
 Of every man
Who put me here 
 I see my light come shining 
 Come shining

You want to dance?
What?
Come on.

 Any day now

 Whoa, oh

He's not to blame 
 All day long, I hear him 
 Cry so loud

Jonathan?
Mm. Hi.
Ow.
I was so in love with you.
I was in love with you too.
But Bobby
is the love of your life.
You know it's not that simple.
It's just that...
I seem to have ended up...
Come to bed.
I can't sleep.
Do you want me
to get up?
No.
Go back to sleep.
Good night, crazy mama.
It'll all seem better
in the morning.
Gonna miss you.
Oh, it's just a few days.
You're taking
a lot of stuff.
Well, she needs
a lot of stuff.
Okay, I think
we're all set.
So...
Bobby...
Uh-huh?
Do you want
to come with us?
I can't.
Bobby...
Do you want to come with us?
No.
[SOFTLY]
Okay.
Okay.
Call me.
I will.
Okay?
Yeah.
JONATHAN:
You're a brave woman,
visiting your mother
all alone.
Ugh.
She's not alone.
She's got Rebecca
with her.
Now...
[KISSES REBECCA]
Don't worry, Miss R.
[REBECCA CRYING]
The best thing
about Philadelphia
is you can leave it,
and we'll be waiting
for you right here
when you come home.
If you're lucky, and good,
we'll have a special surprise
waiting for you
when you get back.
Lovey. Lovey.

Uh-huh?
Be good.
Always.
Love you.

You sleeping, man?
I can't, really.
They're not coming back,
you know.
This is a good spot,
don't you think?
Yeah, I do.
You think we should,
like, say a few words?
We got this far, Dad.
I think you'd like it.
I really do.
Amen.
I should've
written something.
No, man.
This is perfect.
Anyway, Dad, here we are.
It's our place,
and it's yours too.
Okay.
Now.
One...
two...
three.
YOUNG JONATHAN:
What's that?
YOUNG BOBBY:
Windowpane.
For clarity of vision.
If something bad
happens,
tell my parents
I tried to be good,
but it was
just too hard.
You're not freaked out
about the graveyard?
I mean, don't be.
The dead are just people too.
People who wanted
the same things we want.
What do we want?
I don't know, man.
I mean, our lives, right?
Man, like, this whole big,
beautiful, noisy world,
and everything that can happen.
Uh-oh.
All's well, little brother.
Your folks love you.
I love you.
Nothing to fear.
BOBBY:
I've been thinking.
We should repaint
Rebecca's room.
Like, pink.
She'd like that.
Don't you think?
Okay.
She'll come back
someday...
to this house, I mean.
It'll be hers.
I guess it will be.
She probably
won't want it, right?
She probably
won't have any idea
what to do with it.
But still,
it'll be hers, you know?
It'll be hers.
Listen...
this will be
an all right place
to put my ashes too,
okay?
Sure.
I mean...
whatever you want.
You built us
a very good home.
That's not what--
That's what you did.
That's what you did
for me, you know?
It's funny,
isn't it?
What?
The big, beautiful,
noisy world.
Everything
that can happen.
Yeah.
It's funny.

[DUNCAN SHEIK'S "THERE'S A HOME"
PLAYING]
 So my friend 
 We're left out
On our own again 
 Oh, yeah, but who knows
Where we're going 
 Come, we'll walk the night
We'll listen 
 To all of those
No longer with us 
 Calling
From some lonely distance 
 Take my hand, come on
And on we'll go 
 Take my hand 
 Something's lasted 
 There's a home 
 So my friend 
 We'll head out
With our hopes again 
 Oh, yeah, we'll face
Whatever's thrown us 
 Come, we'll walk
We'll find what lingers 
 Of the things
That might have been there 
 Other dreams
Of other winters 
 Take my hand 
 Come on, and on we'll go 
 Take my hand 
 Bury the laughter 
 There with tears
We've known 
 Trailing our shadows 
 You and me, on this road 
 Built of sadness 
 There's a home 
 And it's our home 
 Bury the laughter 
 There
With tears we've known 
 You and me, shadows 
 There's a home 
 Traveling this long road 
 Built of sadness 
 There's a home 
 For what's happened 
 Something's lasted 
 There's a home 
 It's our home 
 Now we're home 
$&$A quiet Passion$&$
You have now come
to the end of your second semester.
Some of you will remain here
to complete your education.
Some of you will 
go out into the world.
And, as is my custom,
I put to you a question
of the utmost importance,
which concerns your 
spiritual wellbeing.
Do you wish to come to God
and be saved?
Those of you who wish to be Christian
and saved will move to my right.
To those of you who remain
and hope to be saved...
you will move to my left.
Have you said your prayers?
Yes.
Though it can't make much
difference to the Creator.
Do I understand you correctly?
Do you believe that your Creator is
indifferent to your sins?
That, in His mercy,
He sees you slumber?
No, you misunderstand me.
I've not got so far.
I am not even awakened yet.
And how should I repent?
I am somewhat troubled, to be sure,
but my feelings are all indefinite.
The question is not
how far you have advanced,
but how far you ought 
to have advanced.
Not how you feel,
but how you ought to feel.
I don't feel anything.
I have no sense of my sins.
And how can I?
I wish I could feel as others do,
but it is not possible.
A sinner against a Holy God
and under condemnation,
and liable every moment to drop
into a burning hopeless eternity,
yet cannot feel, cannot be alarmed,
cannot "flee from the wrath to come".
And the true question is...
Are you in the Ark of Safety?
I fear I am not.
You are alone in your rebellion,
Miss Dickinson.
I fear that you are a no-hoper.
Yes, Miss Lyon.
For each ecstatic instant
We must an anguish pay
In keen and quivering ratio
To the ecstasy.
For each beloved hour
Sharp pittances of years,
Bitter contested farthings
And coffers heaped with tears.
Father. Austin. Vinnie!
My happiness would be complete,
if only Mother were with you.
The journey would have been
too fatiguing for her.
We have come to 
take you home, Emily.
- We were concerned by your last letter.
- You spoke of being ill.
Yes. What is it that
you are suffering from?
An acute case of evangelism.
- Am I really to go home?
- Yes.
We will go to Amherst, via Boston,
and stay for a short while
with Aunt Elizabeth.
I fear you don't approve, Father?
I do not like to see a woman
upon the stage.
But she has a gift.
A gift is no excuse for a female
to exhibit herself in that way.
And what would you have her do?
Perform an act of congress aloud?
That would depend
upon what key it was in.
Well, the rest of her programme
is in respectable German.
And the Germans
are wonderful in music.
That's true.
English, thank heaven,
is not a language that can be sung.
But, Aunt Elizabeth,
you love your hymn tunes.
Hymns are different. They have
absolutely nothing to do with music.
Ah, the devil in music.
Don't be trite, Emily.
Oh, life!
Oh, home!
How wonderful you are!
Emily.
Why are you up so late?
- May I speak with you, Father?
- Of course.
As you may know, I like to write.
Letters, mostly... but sometimes poetry.
Yes.
May I have your permission to write
during the night, for quiet's sake?
I shall not disrupt
the rest of the household, I promise.
Yes, you may.
It was very considerate of you to ask.
It is your house, Father.
But it is our home, Emily.
I... I have one more favour
to ask of you, Father.
What is it?
You are, I believe, on cordial terms
with Dr Holland,
the editor of the 
Springfield Republican.
And the Springfield Republican
publishes poetry.
I'll write to him.
And if he agrees,
you may send him some of your work.
"Dear Miss Dickinson,
"I have decided to publish
'Sic transit Gloria mundi'
"as it is the least wayward
and shows some wit.
"As to the rest of the poetry,
it is in the common metre,
"childish, like nursery rhymes.
"But I must confess that the 
genuine classics of every language
"are the work of men, not of women.
"Women, I fear, cannot create
the permanent treasures of literature."
Where's Emily?
Emily!
Come here at once!
Remember, Aunt Elizabeth has
celebrated the Dickinson dynasty
- in 55 stanzas.
- And every one of them dull.
Aunt Elizabeth!
Oh, at last, Emily.
I was nearly kept waiting.
And what is your opinion 
of my poem, Emily?
I'm sure your verse is equal
to your talent, Aunt.
If I were clever enough, I should probably
take offence at that dubious compliment.
Oh, but, Aunt, all the best 
compliments are dubious.
That's part of their charm.
Did you enjoy my verses, Austin?
Very much, Aunt.
They put Paradise Lost to shame.
Your children are far 
too sophisticated, Edward.
I'm sure part of me disapproves.
- Disapproval is a heavy thing.
- Oh.
Besides, if I had to choose between
having sophisticated children
and ones that were merely docile,
I should choose the former.
- Docility is too much like slavery.
- That sounds like abolitionist talk.
No, it is not. But no Christian
could ever make a case for slavery.
Please, let us not discuss this subject.
It is both improper and tiresome.
Not to those who are enslaved.
I see we have a 
Robespierre in our midst.
No, not Robespierre.
Charlotte Corday, perhaps.
Edward, they're as bad as you are.
I believe you've had your 
first poem published.
Yes.
In the Springfield Republican.
It-- it was printed anonymously.
That seems a little eccentric.
But in the circumstances,
probably a good thing.
We can't all be Milton.
Don't pout, Emily. It's unbecoming.
Poems are my solace for the 
eternity which surrounds us all.
- Who said that?
- I did.
Well, don't. It sounds unchristian.
And where's Vinnie?
Here, Aunt.
And what of you?
Oh, I am like Pilgrim, trying to improve.
A pilgrim should only ever be conscious
of other people's self-improvement.
Consciousness of his own is mere vanity.
But, Aunt, vanity is such a harmless vice.
It's as shallow as
the people who indulge in it.
No vice is harmless, Vinnie.
Look no further than Babylon for that.
- What of you, Austin?
- Oh, I'm on no pilgrimage at all.
And what of vice?
Surely vice is only virtue in disguise.
And what is your opinion
of your children's moral laxity, Emily?
Oh, I prefer to listen and remain silent.
That way, a prejudice
doesn't seem like an opinion.
That reply was so Sphinx-like,
I'm none the wiser.
Oh, cherish your ignorance, Aunt.
You never know when you will need it.
Edward!
Your children astound me.
They ought to be sent to 
their rooms and pummelled.
- Hourly.
- Calm down, Aunt Elizabeth.
Have a glass of currant wine.
Turn vice into medicinal pleasure.
- Medicinal?
- For your circulation.
There is nothing wrong
with my circulation.
The heart asks pleasure first,
And then, excuse from pain;
And then, those little anodynes
That deaden suffering;
And then, to go to sleep;
And then, if it should be
The will of its Inquisitor,
The liberty to die.
Would you play something, Emily?
One of the old hymn tunes.
Of course.
When I was very young,
a young man who used 
to go to our church
used to sing that.
He had a lovely voice.
So pure.
He was only 19 when he died.
The--
There.
God keep you well.
When He is ready, He will call me.
I hope you live for a hundred years.
What a repellent idea.
Oh, Aunt, don't say that.
I'm not afraid of death, Emily.
Nor should you be.
If we keep our souls in readiness
for God, there can be no fear.
He will smooth our way.
I shall pray for you all.
And remember, keep atheism at bay.
And watch the clock 
that ticks for us all.
Tick.
Took.
Tick.
Oh, you are all impossible!
I went to thank her,
But she slept;
Her bed a funnelled stone,
With nosegays at the head and 
foot, that travellers had thrown,
Who went to thank her;
But she slept.
'Twas short to cross the sea
To look upon her like, alive,
But turning back 'twas slow.
You think you might 
smile, Mr Dickinson?
I am smiling!
Emily! Emily!
We have a guest.
This is Miss Vryling Buffam.
It sounds like an anagram, doesn't it?
You see before you a life
blighted by baptism.
Yeah, I hope you brought
to the attention of your parents
their lack of thought in that respect.
I have. It makes them very cross.
But surely they will forgive you.
Ah, but will I forgive them?
Weren't you at a ladies' seminary
at Fort Sumter or somewhere?
- Mount Holyoke.
- Yes, I thought it had a military ring to it.
But that was years ago.
And were your studies as disciplined?
Algebra, geometry, the natural sciences.
And for the sake of decorum,
ecclesiastical history.
I believe all women should have
the same educational advantages as men.
But ecclesiastical history?
It sounds as dreary as Paradise.
We brought her home.
Did you dislike Mount Holyoke so much?
She was bullied there.
There's bullying and there's coercion.
And which did you suffer?
A unique combination of both.
- It was appalling.
- Yes, but... it puts iron in the soul.
But what is the point of that when,
in the end, we are all extinguished?
- Do you fear death?
- No.
But I fear Heaven.
I'm afraid it will seem like an anticlimax.
Perfection usually does.
And what of Hell?
I'm sure that will be 
even duller than Heaven.
That will be the agony.
Will you go with us 
to church, Miss Buffam?
Of course not.
Going to church is like going to Boston.
You only enjoy it
after you've gotten home.
We are to pray for the repose
of our late pastor's soul.
Doesn't that rather depend
on where it's gone?
We shall become fast friends.
Of course we shall. I'm irresistible.
Everyone says so.
When the new pastor does arrive,
you must point him out to me.
So that you, too, may be saved?
No.
So that I will know whom to avoid.
Don't enjoy your praying too much.
It might become habit-forming.
- Do you come to God, sir?
- We do, sir.
Do you come humbly, sir?
I come as myself, Pastor.
You want to come to Christ as a lawyer?
You need to come as a poor sinner.
Get down on your knees
and let me pray for you.
And then you can pray for yourself.
- And you, Miss Dickinson. What of you?
- What of me, sir?
Will you not kneel
and give yourself to God?
No, sir, I will not kneel.
Though I think that God has
already given Himself to me.
- That was profane.
- It was not meant so, sir.
- Do you guard your soul, Emily?
- As best as I am able, sir.
And Hell? What of Hell?
Avoid it if I can. Endure it if I must.
- That was irreligious, young lady.
- Then I beg God's pardon for my impiety.
Let us pray for all sinners.
How dare you conduct yourself
in such a manner?
It is both unchristian and unseemly!
I will not be forced to piety!
You will do as you are instructed.
I know your Christian 
shore is safer, Father.
And I know I must seem 
recalcitrant, but my soul is my own.
Your soul is God's!
You neglect it at your peril.
- Yes, Father.
- And in future,
you will conduct yourself in a manner
that is befitting the station in life
to which it has pleased 
God to call you.
Yes, Father.
Goodnight, Emily.
Goodnight, Father.
This plate is dirty.
It is dirty no longer.
I wouldn't have gone that far.
If I had, Father would have packed 
me off to a good military school
and Mother would have tearfully
embroidered something.
Ah. The eternal Miss Buffam.
Alas, no, sir. Father Time 
knocks at my door also.
And what precautions do you take?
I contrive never to be 
at home when he calls.
All women should aspire
to that state of readiness.
No. Women should only aspire to be
younger than their waistlines.
Then the unpleasant topic of age
becomes almost irrelevant.
And what should men aspire to?
Tobogganing.
And in warmer weather?
Philately. It has all the dangers 
of sport without any of the rigour.
Your banter, Miss Buffam,
is, as always, delightful.
Take it, Mr Dickinson, as the mere
outpourings of a poor, tormented soul.
Ladies.
- Now you go too far.
- We were trying to be ironic.
Come in.
- Will you come to church, Emily?
- No, Father.
- Why will you not come?
- God knows what is in my heart.
He doesn't require me to 
be in a pew to remind Him.
I hope that remark isn't 
as frivolous as it sounds.
Your soul is no trivial matter.
I agree, Father.
That's why I'm so meticulous
in guarding its independence.
I reckon - when I count out all -
First - poets - then the sun -
Then summer - then the Heaven of God
And then - the list is done -
But, looking back - the first so seems -
To comprehend the whole -
The others look a needless show -
So I write - poets - all -
Their summer - lasts a solid year -
They can afford a sun
The East - would deem extravagant -
And if the further heaven -
Be beautiful as they prepare
For those who worship them -
It is too difficult a grace -
To justify the dream -
- What is it?
- From Austin.
Likenesses of Austin and his 
bride-to-be, Susan Gilbert.
Oh!
- Austin as handsome as ever.
- But she looks terrified.
We must welcome her and reassure 
her we are not all forbidding.
Oh, Emily, my own!
This is a luxury that is almost Parisian.
Let's not be anything 
today except superficial.
Yes. And superficiality
should always be spontaneous.
If it is studied, it is 
too close to hypocrisy.
We may be superficial,
but we aren't stupid.
Heaven forbid.
This is my third commencement
ball, and not a hint of romance.
Do you suppose that men are 
frightened of a woman who teaches
and is used to her independence?
Men are supposed to be fearless,
aren't they?
In war, yes. In religion, always.
In love, never.
Look at that divine creature.
- What a noble head he has.
- Like a Roman emperor.
Nero.
Let's hope he's just as wicked.
As long as he has a fortune,
we can take his wickedness
as merely a lapse in virtue.
I think you must prepare yourself
for a polka.
May I be permitted to have the next
dance on your card, Miss Buffam?
I don't have a dance card, sir.
I prefer to... improvise.
- Isn't that rather dangerous?
- That is precisely why I do it.
Ladies.
How was the divinity?
He dances like a polar bear.
And a prig.
Did you say something 
to him to shock him?
Only that I'd just finished reading
Wuthering Heights.
And he was scandalised.
- Had he read it?
- No.
So I told him that to condemn
a novel he had not read
would be like going
to Sodom or Gomorrah
and being disappointed
that neither were Philadelphia.
I hope he had the presence
of mind to laugh.
He didn't.
He went very silent and the air became
charged with unspoken profanity.
It was delicious.
Now, I must go. Miss Buffam has a tryst.
- That sounds sinful.
- Hm.
I was told once, by a clergyman,
that I should repent my sins,
otherwise I would be 
pursued by the Devil.
"Oh, a sort of spiritual 
Wells Fargo," I said.
He promptly went silent,
like patience on a monument.
Appalled but dumb.
For the lost soul, there 
will be no tomorrow.
For the lost soul, today is quite enough.
Oh, I shall miss you if you ever go.
Your honesty is sublime.
In the long term,
honesty is not the best policy.
- Is dishonesty?
- I prefer to call it diplomacy.
That way, one can turn a 
tactical defeat into a victory.
- Who proposed that?
- Oh, I don't know.
Probably George Washington as he was
crossing the Delaware. The wrong way.
Now, my own, I must fly.
Drive carefully, and don't 
do anything against God.
- I'll stop yodelling, then.
- Very wise.
Quickly, Pendennis.
Before second thoughts set in.
Oh, come in, Emily.
- Shall I close the door?
- No. Leave it open.
It's lovely to hear the music.
It makes me recollect
when your father and I went
to our first commencement ball.
All those years ago.
This is my sister Lavinia.
But everyone calls me Vinnie.
And this is my other sister, Emily.
And everyone calls me Napoleon.
You come back married and a lawyer.
Harvard has clearly 
agreed with you, Austin.
Even more agreeable is that 
we now shall be neighbours.
Susan and I are moving
into The Evergreens, next door.
Another thunderbolt!
But a most welcome one.
Austin and I are to 
practise law. Together.
Shingle has never sounded so lovely.
Is there no end to these wonders?
I welcome you both.
My son and his lovely bride.
His very lovely bride.
And this is the greatest wonder of all.
Mother coming down from Mount Olympus.
Oh...
Emily, as usual, dramatises.
I live a very quiet life.
No one would know I was here.
But if you weren't, oh, what 
a chasm you would leave.
Bees in the lavender
Then the lazy owl
Will you marry?
I suppose in time I shall.
Isn't that what we all do, in the end?
I don't know.
I can't imagine myself beyond my family.
Amongst strangers.
You are a strange creature, with
more depth, I suspect, than any of us.
How can you say that?
I haven't demonstrated that at all.
Oh, my dear, you don't 
demonstrate, you reveal.
When you eventually 
do go away, will you write?
I do not possess the propensity
for long correspondence.
- I suspect I have a trivial mind.
- But a good heart.
Don't let sentiment
cloud your judgement, Emily.
Should my future husband
put me out of humour,
he will think he has married
one of the minor Borgias.
Will you marry?
I only want my family.
It is not perfect.
It is not Paradise.
But it is far better than 
anything I could know.
Or want.
When you do marry...
- I shall miss you.
- Of course you shall miss me.
I refuse to be forgotten.
Emily.
Make sure your bread is ready
for the agricultural fair tomorrow.
Yes. I haven't forgotten.
They feel swollen.
They are swollen, like my feet.
Oh!
Aah!
Miss Emily?
Will you please get my 
bread out of the oven?
It doesn't need all three 
of you to pick it up!
I believe you spoke sharply to Thomas,
Margaret and Maggie yesterday.
- Yes, Father.
- They must be treated with respect.
They are not servants, but employees.
What was that for?
For pointing out so eloquently
the distinction between the two.
I was very impolite yesterday.
I would like to apologise
to all three of you.
Er, no offence taken.
Then may I take it that I am forgiven?
For I am truly sorry.
But we have good news, miss.
Your bread won five dollars.
Then you must keep the money.
It will ease my conscience.
It took second prize.
Oh. Second prize.
What does it feel like 
to be a father, Austin?
Fatherly.
May I hold him?
- We're calling him Edward.
- Ned, for short.
I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.
How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell one's name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
Father? What is it?
Fort Sumter has been fired upon.
What does this mean?
It is thought that the South 
will secede from the Union.
Then it means civil war.
Does this mean you 
will be drafted, Austin?
Almost certainly.
You will remain here.
But, Father, my friends will 
fight. I cannot stay at home.
I will pay the $500 bond so that
a substitute may fight in your place.
- What about my honour, sir?
- Your honour, sir, will be safe in my hands.
And my conscience, Father?
What of that?
It will be best if your conscience
found solace in you doing your filial duty.
For those who will die in this civil war,
"filial duty" will seem like cowardice.
No young man of breeding
would make such a remark.
No gentleman would provoke it!
Austin.
You are my only son.
I cannot see your life put at risk.
Please, Father, don't make me stay.
You are not to go! I forbid it!
I will remain here.
To fight aloud, is very brave -
But gallanter, I know
Who charge within the bosom
The Cavalry of Woe -
Who win, and nations do not see -
Who fall - and none observe -
Whose dying eyes, no Country
Regards with patriot love -
We trust, in plumed procession,
For such, the Angels go -
Rank after Rank, with even feet -
And Uniforms of snow.
There is a word
Which bears a sword
Can pierce an armed man.
It hurls its barbed syllables, -
And once is mute again.
But where it fell
The saved will tell
On patriotic day,
Some epauletted brother
Gave his breath away
Wherever runs the breathless sun,
Wherever roams the day,
There is its noiseless onset,
There its victory!
We went to Gettysburg
to hear the speeches.
Mr Edward Everett spoke
for nearly two hours.
- Very rousing.
- And the President's speech?
Mr Lincoln was 
shocking in his brevity.
He spoke for about three 
minutes. Not memorable.
Were there many there
to hear the orations?
Some said fifteen thousand.
Most of them looking for breakfast,
or trying to find souvenirs of the battle.
Macabre.
They say that over six hundred 
thousand men have perished.
And for what?
To end slavery, which should never have
flourished in this country in the first place.
Miss Buffam has had too great 
an influence over you, Emily.
If more men were as outspoken as
Miss Buffam, we may not have had a war.
How dare you trivialise it in that way?
The conflict was not about gender.
Any argument about gender is war,
because that, too, is slavery.
- That's a contemptible thing to say.
- Live as a woman for a week, Austin.
You will find it neither congenial nor trivial.
So you leave tomorrow?
How long will you be gone?
Two months, maybe.
Both cases are difficult, and both 
are being tried by Judge Lord.
And you know how fierce he can be.
- Must you go for such a length of time?
- Yes.
A man must make his way in the 
world. He can't be merely decorous.
And a woman? What should she do?
Or is she destined
only for decorousness?
Let's not argue.
Not on my last night at home.
I'll write.
- It'll ease my unhappiness.
- But increase mine.
What are you doing at this hour?
It is my time for writing.
Between three am and morning.
My father allows it.
No husband would.
I came over.
- I thought something was amiss.
- No.
It is the best time,
when it feels as if the whole
world is asleep and still.
Why did you take so long
to consent to marry Austin?
In truth...
the thought of men in
that particular respect...
turned me to stone.
Although Austin is...
very tender...
and yielding to my...
reservations.
Is that particular part of 
married life so terrible?
I do my duty.
But I have not only 
gained a husband,
but two sisters also.
Yes.
We will be sisters.
And we shall share 
and read everything.
The BrontÃ«s.
George Eliot.
And, Heaven save us, Mrs Gaskell also.
And you have your poetry.
But you have a life.
I have a routine.
It is God's one concession
to a no-hoper.
Does nothing give you solace?
For those of us who live minor lives,
and are deprived of...
a particular kind of love,
we know best how to starve.
We deceive ourselves, and then others.
It is the worst kind of lie.
But in matters of the soul...
you are rigorous.
Rigour is no substitute for happiness.
Oh, what a call is this?
The dear ones, whose names are 
written in the Lamb's Book of Life,
cry "Come, come!"
And the church below, Christ's witness
unto the world and the church above,
with the rustling of the white robes,
and the sweeping of the golden harps,
cries "Come, come!"
And the angels of Heaven, lo! Rank
above rank, immortal principalities,
as they circle the eternal throne.
They have caught up the sound,
and cry "Come, come!"
Reverend Wadsworth's sermons
take the breath away!
That kind of religious 
ecstasy is wonderful,
but back in the quiet of one's own room,
it seems as remote as Spitsbergen.
Still, he is as handsome
as he is ecstatic.
And he is so clean.
Like a cherub after bathing.
And happily married.
Ah, to be betrothed
without the swoon.
But a person may hope.
If you're too quick to hope,
you'll always be disappointed.
And if I am too quick 
to despair, what then?
Then you will be too slow to hope.
I set too much store by friendships.
When we lose friends to death,
that is the most profound loss.
When we lose them to marriage,
the grief is subtler, but just as keenly felt.
We cannot keep the world, or life,
at bay, Emily. Neither can we ignore it.
We can do better than that.
We can be vigilant against it.
But when that vigil is over, what then?
Eternity. And in that 
place, no loss is felt.
But what of the kingdom to come?
That may be a gain,
but only after the fact.
One day, you may marry.
I think not.
You and Austin are the handsome ones.
I am a kangaroo amongst the beauties.
No! You have a lovely 
face and a fine soul.
Then let us hope the man who courts 
me will have an interest in zoology...
and all things spiritual.
Let us invite the Reverend 
Wadsworth to tea.
And Mrs Wadsworth.
Very well.
And you must promise me you'll behave.
I know how provocative you can be.
I will muster all the dignity I can.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Will you take coffee, Mrs Wadsworth?
Er, tea, then?
No, thank you.
Mrs Wadsworth is an abstainer.
I thought abstention was only for alcohol.
For me, it extends to tea, also.
They say the Chinese drink tea
for remedial purposes.
I'm glad to say that I'm not Chinese.
Some lemonade, then?
Surely God would not
disapprove of lemonade?
Levity and the will of God are, I think,
incompatible. Almost improper.
Just plain water would be pleasant.
Reverend Wadsworth?
Just a cup of hot water for me, thank you.
I understand from Vinnie
that you are a poet?
I write verses, yes.
And what of your contemporaries?
Mr Longfellow, for instance.
His genius lies in stating the obvious.
Oh, that is too harsh. There are 
many fine things in Hiawatha.
I'm sorry I was cruel.
But, madam, I must say in truth,
Hiawatha is but gruel.
Read just one stanza for the proof.
No.
Give me something pressed
from truth, and that is poetry.
I suppose you feel the BrontÃ«s do that?
Yes. And a few others.
What do you find
in all that Yorkshire gloom?
The beauty of truth.
The poetry of the known.
But why can't they dwell
on something wholesome?
If they wished to be wholesome,
I would imagine they would crochet.
Would you like to take 
a turn in our garden?
No, thank you.
I find this heat oppressive.
But Charles loves to be out of doors.
I myself prefer the shade.
In that case, I will take the liberty
of escorting your husband
around our modest garden.
And my sister can 
have you all to herself.
More water?
Thank you for your 
invitation, Miss Dickinson.
I was very moved by your sermon, sir,
and wanted very much to tell you.
This is all I have to give in return.
Please say something.
Does my poetry have any worth?
They are remarkable.
Uncompromising, yes,
but this is wonderful poetry.
How many have been published?
Seven.
Eleven?
I cannot recall.
- And no more?
- And no more.
How can you be so stoic?
It's easy to be stoic when no one
wants what you have to offer.
There is, I suppose, always posterity.
But posterity is as comfortless as God.
That sounds like despair.
No, it's bitterness.
Besides...
a posthumous reputation
is only for those who, when living,
weren't worth remembering.
Still... Ah!
To be racked by success!
But I would like some 
approval before I die.
If you were coming in the fall,
I'd brush the summer by
With half a smile and half a spurn,
As housewives do a fly.
If I could see you in a year,
I'd wind the months in balls,
And put them each in separate
drawers, until their time befalls.
If only centuries delayed,
I'd count them on my hand,
Subtracting till my fingers dropped
Into Van Diemen's land.
If certain, when this life was out,
That yours and mine should be,
I'd toss it yonder like a rind,
And taste eternity.
But now, all ignorant of the length
Of time's uncertain wing,
It goads me, like the goblin bee,
That will not state its sting.
I must have someone
with a sense of humour,
someone who can laugh at the world.
Taking life seriously
is the shortest route to disaster.
And have you found such a one?
Someone has found me.
A Mr Wilder, a Professor of Mathematics.
And if he can find comedy
in a vulgar fraction, I'm his.
- But do you love him?
- Love? I cannot say.
It's a very beguiling idea.
They even say it exists.
But how will you know?
What if you make an error?
If he is a bad choice,
I'll have him killed quietly
and tell everyone he died of 
some sort of algebraic shock.
I hope you will be happy.
That cannot be guaranteed.
I'll settle for consideration.
- That sounds like surrender.
- No, it's practicality.
And who knows?
Perhaps love will come in its wake.
- Then I can relax into smugness.
- You could never be smug.
Life catches you out, Emily. In the end,
we all become the thing we most dread.
Then I will reject the world
and not fulfil that prophecy.
Then you will be making
the greatest of mistakes,
for you will deny yourself
what your spirit needs most.
- And what is that?
- Truth. And experience.
Otherwise, your vow will 
be an act of cowardice.
- That was hurtful.
- But honest.
Don't resist your vices, Emily.
It is your virtues you should be wary of.
Austin once told Aunt Elizabeth
that our virtues are just vices in disguise.
Now, there is a man
with a sense of humour.
And does your Mr Wilder possess one?
Of a kind.
He proposed to me by letter,
so if the marriage is unhappy,
I shall blame the US mail.
Always conform.
Keep disobedience secret.
Be outwardly docile, but in your heart,
you can be as revolutionary as you like.
- But isn't that hypocrisy?
- Of course it is.
But in America, we cherish it.
We think it makes us incorruptible.
You must never confuse
the outer with the inner piety.
Only Episcopalians do that.
But I am rebellious and 
far from the grace of God.
You are closer to Him
than anyone I know.
Always look below the surface, Emily,
but don't be afraid of what you find there.
- Chaos?
- Yes.
Then I shall confront everything.
Don't be too radical, Emily.
Radicals don't thrive in this country.
- But you are a radical.
- But I'll eventually conform.
For the sake of peace or a quiet life.
But I know that you will not,
and I envy you your courage.
I suppose you shall carry lovely flowers
and have Mr Mendelssohn's
"Wedding March".
Flowers, yes. Mendelssohn, no.
Never play happy music at a wedding,
Emily, it's too misleading.
- But you shall be forever gone from us.
- You make it sound like dying.
- Isn't it?
- No.
And even if it were, you must
force yourself to think otherwise.
America is the only country in the world
that looks upon death
as some kind of personal failure.
May I get you something, Mother?
No, Emily.
You've always seemed so sad, Mother.
My life has passed as if in a dream.
As if I'd never been part of it.
After Vinnie was born,
a kind of melancholia settled over me
which I mistook for contentment.
Were we such a terrible price to pay?
No!
I wouldn't be without all three of you.
To have my children about me...
there could be no better medicine.
Sometimes...
at a certain hour...
when the sun is low...
the shadows lengthen...
I am filled with such 
a sense of longing.
I feel such a weight on my heart.
Oh, how it aches.
Oh, my dear.
Oh, my dear.
There, my lamb. There.
Oh!
Reverend Wadsworth
has sailed for San Francisco.
They all go. They all leave.
They all desert you.
Do not touch me!
I will not be pitied.
It makes me feel repulsive.
You set too much store
by physical beauty, Emily.
The only people who can be sanguine
about not being handsome
are those who are beautiful already.
The rest of us have only 
our envy to keep us warm.
- You have an exquisite nature.
- What's the use of that in this world?
I sometimes think you are 
too harsh with yourself.
I have many defects.
There is much to rectify!
It is just as punitive
to admit to too many faults
as it is to deny too few virtues.
The Reverend Wadsworth
is a married man.
This kind of attachment is improper.
We can't all possess your smug rectitude.
Don't sneer at anyone's morals
when your own could do with
some little correction.
By that, I assume you 
mean Reverend Wadsworth?
He's married!
You should not attach yourself
to someone who is not free
to return that attachment!
You hardly know the man,
except through his sermons.
Besides, he and Mrs 
Wadsworth are very happy.
She has led a blameless life.
She hasn't led a life at all!
She's too inert for that.
If docility were love, we would 
all live happily ever after.
She's a good wife!
And, to be truthful, I have never understood
the attraction of her husband for you.
He is hardly a Mr Rochester,
and you are certainly not Jane Eyre!
That was unkind.
I'm sorry, too.
You're not smug.
But I do sermonise.
And I do over-dramatise.
But it was news that was...
is hard to bear.
Oh, you are a wretched creature!
Will you never achieve anything?
We outgrow love like other things
And put it in the drawer,
Till it an antique fashion shows
Like costumes grandsires wore.
May the Lord make His 
face shine upon you
and be gracious unto you.
May the Lord lift up His countenance
unto you and give you peace.
We wish you all the 
happiness in the world.
No tears, Emily.
No tears.
- Will you come?
- No.
Wave her my goodbye.
The dying need but little, dear -
A glass of water's all,
A flower's unobtrusive face
To punctuate the wall,
A fan, perhaps, a friend's regret,
And certainly that one
No colour in the rainbow
Perceives when you are gone.
Look back on time with kindly eyes,
He doubtless did his best;
How softly sinks his trembling sun
In human nature's west!
Of so divine a loss
We enter but the gain,
Indemnity for loneliness
That such a bliss has been.
If we reach into the silence
then we cannot be afraid,
for where there is nothing, 
there is God.
Emily?
Emily?
You must eat.
You must come down now.
It's been three days.
You are wearing white.
Yes.
But we're still in mourning.
So am I.
Emily? It's Mr Bowles.
He's come to Amherst
specially to see you.
Well, come down, damn you.
I refuse to speak to someone
who's a flight of stairs above me.
Forgive me, sir, if I'm frightened.
I never see anyone
and I hardly know what to say.
You could say thank you
for my publishing some of your verse.
For that, sir, you have more than
my thanks. You have my gratitude.
But, sir...
you have altered
some of my punctuation.
Good Lord. What's a hyphen 
here or a semi-colon there?
To many, nothing.
But, to me, the alteration of my
punctuation marks is very hard to endure.
Then I apologise.
I was merely trying to make
your meaning clearer to my readers.
Clarity is one thing, sir,
obviousness quite another.
The only person qualified to interfere
with the poet's work is the poet herself.
From anyone else, it feels like an attack.
Miss Dickinson, this is 
no way to speak or behave.
If you treated a suitor like 
this, he would not return.
- Are you sure there will be one?
- Of course.
Even for someone as 
hard to please as yourself.
Well, if he does come,
he will have to be as spectacular
as Disraeli and as sincere as Gladstone.
And as upright as George Washington?
George who?
Emily?
Mr Emmons is coming to see us.
Our beautiful friend?
- Will you come down?
- No.
This is discourteous. Why will 
you not come down and meet him?
Because he is so beautiful,
and I am not beautiful enough.
He's read some of your published 
poems and admires them.
Admiration always masks envy.
What does envy mask?
Oh, that masks admiration.
He may come to the foot of the stairs.
- Miss Dickinson?
- Yes.
- I cannot see you.
- That, sir, is no matter.
It is the first time
I've conducted a visit in this fashion.
It seems unfair that you can 
see me but I can only hear you.
That can be no hardship, sir,
for I am best heard and not seen.
Er... Will you take a ride
with Vinnie and me?
I do not cross my father's 
ground to any house or town.
That seems such a shame,
especially in such lovely weather.
The weather will remain lovely
whether I drive through it or not.
Then I wish you good day,
Miss Dickinson.
Good day, Mr Emmons.
He will mount the 
stairs at midnight
The looming man in the night
No ordinary bridegroom he
But I will wait all my days
And he will come before the afterlife
Oh, please, let him come
Let him not forget me!
âª Since first I saw your face, I resolved
âª To honour and renown you
âª If now I am disdained, I wish
âª My heart had never known you
âª What! I that loved, and you that liked
âª Shall we begin to wrangle?
âª No, no, no, my heart is fast
âª And cannot disentangle
âª If I admire or praise you too much
âª That fault you may forgive me
âª Or if my hands had strayed to touch
âª Then justly might you leave me
âª I asked you leave, you bade me love
âª Is't now a time to chide me?
âª No, no, no, I love you still
âª What fortune e'er betide me
âª If I have wronged you, tell me wherein
âª And I will soon amend it
âª In recompense of such a sin
âª Here is my heart, I'll send it
âª If that will not your mercy move
âª Then, for my life I care not
âª Then, oh, then, torment me still
âª And take my life and spare not âª
Oh, Emily, you should 
have come - it was radiant.
Yes. And I'm sure you would have
made it even more radiant, Miss Emily.
Ridicule is not the way to any 
woman's heart, sir. Least of all mine.
It was meant sincerely.
Or should I judge beauty
by the common standard?
Any standard may be common.
Familiarity, as they say, breeds contempt.
Perhaps contempt breeds familiarity.
At any rate, beauty is in 
the eye of the beholder.
That is no longer true, sir.
For that truism has become a clichÃ©.
Miss Dickinson, you are 
just a little too sharp.
And you, sir, are a little 
too quick to play the martyr.
Then I'll take my leave
before any blood is spilt.
There are wounds which do not bleed,
but which aggrieve nonetheless.
I just assumed that you wanted
to be rid of me. I meant no injury.
Nor did I, sir. I only wish to be honest.
May I call again?
If it gives you no pleasure,
what is the point?
I had hoped that my company
wouldn't be a burden.
A burden can always be laid down, sir.
You are not required
to be another Sisyphus.
Oh, Emily, why do you behave like this?
He is a kind man and he was hurt.
I don't know.
As soon as they get too close,
I feel as if I'm suffocating.
I long for... something.
But I am afraid of it.
A man may love and then cool,
but it is not that way with me.
But you cannot be equal to a man.
If I cannot have equality,
then I want nothing of love.
I will not be so confined
that I cannot breathe.
But a rebellious spirit
invites only retribution.
Then I will be silent in my rebellion,
so that no one will know
what my true feelings are.
- God will know.
- But I will not be married to God.
But you are His possession
and answerable to Him.
He will know of my 
struggle and be merciful.
And if He does not exist,
then I will be eternally free.
We never know we go, -
when we are going
We jest and shut the door;
Fate following behind us bolts it,
And we accost no more.
He fumbles at your spirit
As players at the keys
Before they drop full music on;
He stuns you by degrees,
Prepares your brittle substance
For the ethereal blow,
By fainter hammers, further heard,
Then nearer, then so slow
Your breath has time to straighten,
Your brain to bubble cool, -
Deals one imperial thunderbolt
That scalps your naked soul.
Have you noticed any 
blood in your urine?
Yes, Doctor.
- Back pain?
- Yes, Doctor.
Severe?
Very severe.
She's had a fever and vomiting.
And your breathing?
It's very restricted.
You have all the common 
symptoms of Bright's Disease.
- It's a disease of the kidneys.
- Is there a cure?
Not to my knowledge.
What is the prognosis, Doctor?
Diuretics and laxatives can 
ease some of the symptoms.
But there is definitely no cure?
No.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll see you out.
This world is not conclusion;
A sequel stands beyond,
Invisible, as music,
But positive, as sound.
It beckons and it baffles;
Philosophies don't know,
And through a riddle, 
at the last, Sagacity must go.
To guess it puzzles scholars;
To gain it, men have shown
Contempt of generations,
And crucifixion known.
Oh, no.
I can hear her sigh
before she makes one.
Emily, Mother has had a stroke.
There.
There.
We've come to say goodnight, Mother.
Why?
I...
Father believed...
...and Mother loved...
She achieved in sweetness
what she lost in strength.
âª Heil'ge Nacht
âª Du sinkest nieder
âª Nieder wallen auch die TrÃ¤ume
âª Wie dein Mondlicht durch die RÃ¤ume âª
Your wife plays beautifully, Mr Todd.
My wife does everything beautifully,
and with her whole being.
They say every man that 
meets her falls in love with her.
No, she says that.
âª Die belauschen sie mit Lust
âª Die belauschen sie mit Lust
âª Rufen, wenn der Tag erwacht
âª Kehre wieder, heil'ge Nacht
âª Holde TrÃ¤ume, kehret wieder
âª Holde TrÃ¤ume
âª Kehret wieder âª
Is this a private rehearsal,
or is it open to the general public?
Mrs Todd, the exit is to your right.
Emily?
Mrs Todd is about to depart.
This life? Or just this house?
Stop it. She'll hear you.
Goodbye, Emily.
Goodbye, Mrs Todd.
Please give my regards to Mr Todd.
A man of rare patience and fortitude.
I'll remember you to him.
Perhaps next time, Emily, when
you wish to say goodbye to a guest,
you might consider using semaphore.
There aren't enough flags
to say what I wish to say.
Use the back stairs, Austin. It's quicker.
Oh, Emily, why do you behave like this?
Now there'll be hostility for days.
How is Susan?
Well, thank you.
She's taking tea with Mabel.
Ah, Mrs Todd. And her dull narcissism.
You mistake confidence for narcissism,
and womanly reticence for dullness.
Whatever else can be said of Mrs Todd,
no one could ever 
accuse her of reticence.
Or does one only
require reticence in a wife?
- My wife is perfectly happy.
- Yes, of course.
I'm sure she sees infidelity,
when accompanied by Schubert,
as a delightful pastime.
A kind of musical adultery.
Real artists cannot be confined
by narrow convention.
Real artists don't deceive 
themselves or their public.
When you have any public to speak of,
I'm sure your reputation
will no doubt be very secure.
In all this, Susan is the innocent party.
If you take the trouble to look,
you'd see there is more to that 
innocence than meets the eye.
That is a despicable thing to say!
Oh, stop bickering!
My sympathies are entirely with Susan.
If she had a liaison with a married 
man, how would you respond?
I would not forgive her.
Yet you "admire" Mrs Todd.
An admirable woman is one 
thing, a wife quite another.
I don't think I've ever been
this close to despising you.
- Don't lecture me on how to live!
- And don't try to justify your position!
It is both immoral and vicious.
Susan is a good and intelligent wife.
Or do you prefer more obvious charms?
By that I assume you mean
Mabel Loomis Todd?
Mrs Todd, yes. And don't tell me your
intentions toward her are merely fraternal!
Especially in that semi-recumbent position!
Sometimes, Emily,
you are as ugly as your poetry!
I wonder if she is that 
percussive with her husband!
There's nothing to be done.
Mabel's made up her mind
to continue the status quo.
She is incapable of making up her mind
because she is too stupid to have one!
That is a horrible thing to say.
You see what a vile person I've become.
That is too harsh.
You lash out because 
you are hurt or angry.
Your anger is, I think,
a defence against the world.
How can you go on loving me
when I don't deserve it?
Because you are so easy to love.
Oh, Vinnie.
Vinnie.
You are not the only one
who has had horrible thoughts.
Yes. Me also.
I once hoped that Mabel would 
go up in a balloon, then explode.
Oh, Vinnie, if that is the 
extent of your wickedness,
your sainthood is assured,
explosions notwithstanding.
Try not to provoke him.
Have you read this article in the 
Springfield Republican, Emily?
No. Why?
It is by Mr Bowles, who 
publishes some of your work.
And whom you admire, I think.
And who is also married.
What does it say?
"Why should we write?
"There is another kind of 
writing, only too common,
"appealing to the 
sympathies of the reader
"without recommending 
itself to its subject.
"It may be called the literature of misery.
"The writers are chiefly women,
gifted women, maybe,
"full of thought and feeling and fancy,
"but poor, lonely and unhappy.
"Also, such suffering
is so seldom healthful.
"It may be a valuable 
discipline in the end,
"but for the time being,
it too often clouds, withers, distorts.
"It is so difficult to see objects 
distinctly through a mist of tears.
"The sketch or poem is..."
That was cruel.
- Life is cruel.
- And cruelty knows no morality.
Are you all right?
Austin was cruel.
He was, I suppose,
defending his position.
Or should we call it
poetic licentiousness?
I must confess, I cannot understand
his infatuation with her
when she already has a husband
who should satisfy her
in every aspect of married life.
They say that with Mr Todd,
it is a venereal case.
- How do you know this?
- There are rumours.
Perhaps now you can view Mabel
in a more favourable light.
I doubt that.
Mrs Todd may have her private troubles,
but it is no excuse for Austin's infidelity.
The brother I once adored has betrayed
Susan in the vilest way imaginable!
People are not saints, Emily.
You judge too harshly
because you judge too highly.
Lowering a standard is the 
first excuse for every villainy.
And keeping to one high principle
is the last refuge of the intolerant.
And what of integrity?
Austin was once fierce
in his defence of it,
and now it seems an encumbrance
to be easily put aside!
Integrity, if taken too far,
can be equally ruthless.
- And do I fit into that category?
- Sometimes, yes!
We're only human, Emily.
Don't pillory us for that.
You're right. Of course.
I wish I had your gentle spirit.
If I castigate Austin,
it is because my own 
failings are equally as great.
We become the very thing we dread,
and I have become embittered.
Despite your vehemence,
you have a soul anyone 
would be proud of.
Oh, Vinnie. Vinnie.
Why has the world
become so ugly?
Our journey had advanced;
Our feet were almost come
To that odd fork in Being's road,
Eternity by term.
Our pace took sudden awe,
Our feet reluctant led.
Before where cities, but between,
The forest of the dead.
Retreat was out of hope, -
Behind, a sealed route,
Eternity's white flag before,
And God at every gate.
Shhh, shhh, shhh. Emily.
Shhh, calm. Emily, calm yourself.
Shhh.
Is there nothing we can do, Doctor?
Hold her down, I'll give 
her some more chloroform.
Shhh. Emily, Emily.
Emily. Shhh, shhh, shhh.
Shhh, Emily. Shhh.
- Shhh.
- Emily, we're here.
- Emily.
- Shhh.
- Easy, calm.
- Shhh.
- Shhh.
- Easy. Yes, yes.
Breathe, Emily. Emily.
- It's all right. It's all right.
- Shhh. Shhh.
Shhh.
Shhh.
Doctor?
- Shhh.
- Easy.

My life closed twice
before its close;
It yet remains to see
If Immortality unveil
A third event to me,
So huge, so hopeless to conceive,
As these that twice befell.
Parting is all we know of Heaven,
And all we need of Hell.
Goodbye to the life I used to live,
And the world I used to know;
And kiss the hills for me, just once;
Now I am ready to go!
Because I could not stop for Death -
He kindly stopped for me -
The carriage held but just ourselves -
And Immortality.
We slowly drove - he knew no haste
And I had put away
My labour and my leisure too,
For His civility.
We passed the school,
where children strove,
At recess - in the ring -
We passed the fields of grazing grain -
We passed the setting sun -
Or rather - he passed us -
The dews drew quivering and chill -
For only gossamer, my gown -
My tippet - only tulle -
We paused before a house that seemed
A swelling of the ground -
The roof was scarcely visible -
The cornice - in the ground -
Since then - 'tis centuries - and yet
Feels shorter than the day
I first surmised the horses' heads
Were toward eternity -
This is my letter to the world,
That never wrote to me, -
The simple news that Nature told,
With tender majesty.
Her message is committed
To hands I cannot see;
For love of her, sweet countrymen,
Judge tenderly of me!
$&$Benediction$&$
The audience
pricks an intellectual ear.
Stravinsky quite the concert
of the year.
Forgetting now
the hullabaloo they made,
the audience pricks
an intellectual ear.
Bassoons begin,
sonority envelopes
our auditory innocence,
and brings to me, I must admit,
some drift of things omnific,
seminal, and adolescent.
Men in boaters, far from Henley,
girls in pink and blue taffeta.
In that long summer,
I hunted, played cricket,
but only watched tennis.
God was in His heaven
{\an8}and there were sausages
for breakfast.
And in small recruiting offices,
dull young men wait
to inscribe in paper quires,
the names of the living
and the dead.
Mr Sassoon.
Yes.
I'm Siegfried.
And I'm Hamo, younger brother.
And we've both
come for our fitting.
Just so, sir.
I think we should
start with the shirts.
You can't have your shirts
too dark, sir.
Ah, war! A la mode!
I never said goodbye to him.
On the idle hill of summer,
sleepy with the flow of streams,
far I hear the steady drummer,
drumming like a noise in dreams.
Far and near and low and louder,
on the roads of Earth go by,
dear to friends
and food for powder,
soldiers marching, all to die.
East and west
in fields forgotten
bleach the bones
of comrades slain.
Lovely lads and dead and rotten.
None that go return again.
Far the calling bugles hollo,
high the screaming fife replies.
Gay the files of scarlet follow:
Woman bore me, I will rise.
I was anxious to know
what you were suffering from.
It's only trench fever,
nothing fatal,
just debilitating.
I dread everything now.
The telephone...
the telegram.
There's only one thing worse
than remaining
in the past, Mother,
and that's begrudging
the future.
The future,
without either of my sons,
is to be dreaded, not enjoyed.
I am writing you
this private letter
with the greatest
possible regret.
I must inform you
that it is my intention
to refuse to perform
any further military duties.
I am doing this as a protest
against the policy
of the government
in prolonging the war
by failing to state
their conditions for peace.
I have written a statement
of my reasons,
of which I enclose a copy.
I am making this statement
as an act of wilful defiance
of military authority
because I believe that the war
is being deliberately prolonged
by those who have
the power to end it.
I am a soldier
convinced that I am acting
on behalf of soldiers.
I believe that the war
upon which I entered
as a war of defence
and liberation
has now become a war
of aggression and conquest.
I believe that the purpose for
which I and my fellow soldiers
entered upon this war
should have been
made so clearly stated
as to have made it impossible
to change them.
And that had this been done,
the objects that actuated us
would now be attainable
by negotiation.
I have seen and endured
the sufferings of the troops
and I can no longer be a party
to prolong these sufferings
for ends
which I believe
to be evil and unjust.
I am not protesting against
the conduct of the war,
but against the political errors
and insincerities for which
the fighting men
are being sacrificed.
On behalf of those
who are suffering now,
I make this protest
against the deception
which is being practised
upon them.
Also, I believe
it may help to destroy
the callous complacency
with which the majority
of those at home
regard the continuance
of agonies
which they do not share
and which they have not
enough imagination to realize.
I suppose this was your doing.
Yes, and Eddie Marsh.
I take this very ill, Robbie.
Why did you involve Marsh?
Because he's Principal Private
Secretary to Winston Churchill
and he wanted to help.
He was instrumental
in getting you
a Medical Board examination
instead of a court martial.
If you were found guilty
at a court martial,
you could be shot.
That was a risk
I was prepared to take.
But there are those
who care for you
and who were not.
A court martial would
have been a platform
to state my opposition
to the conduct of the war,
and you have
prevented me doing so.
And not only
for this Times article
but for my statement
to be read out
on the floor of the House.
You've rendered me
impotent, Robbie.
You've robbed me of my dignity.
Better that than a firing squad.
That is a matter of opinion.
Don't be angry
with me, Siegfried.
My intentions were honourable.
An old cowpoke went ridin' out
One dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested
as he went along his way
When all at once, a mighty
herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A-ploughing through
the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw
Yippee-yi-ay
Yippee-yi-oh
The ghost herd in the sky
Their brands were still on fire
And their hooves
were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny
And their hot breath
he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him
As they thundered
through the sky
For he saw the riders
coming hard
And he heard
their mournful cries
Yippee-yi-ay
Yippee-yi-oh
Ghost riders in the sky
As the riders loped on by him
He heard one call his name
If you wanna save
your soul from hell
A-riding on our range
Then, cowboy
change your ways today
Or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies
Yippee-yi-ay
Yippee-yi-oh
Yippee-yi-oh
Yippee-yi-oh
Ghost riders in the sky
Yippee-yi-ay
Yippee-yi-oh
I'm intrinsically against
any kind of conversion.
It's too much
like wishful thinking.
Besides, in a poet,
it seems to imply he has
nothing interesting left to say.
I said I was only
thinking about it.
Surely you're not
looking for God?
That's one way of putting it.
Well, speaking as one of the
spiritually-undernourished,
if you find him, make sure
he's still an Englishman,
doesn't live on the wrong side
of the park.
I assume that was
supposed to be amusing.
Why Catholicism, Father?
Something permanent,
unchanging.
You can get that from dressage
but without the guilt.
There is no need to be snide.
If all you can do is ridicule,
it would be better
if you remained silent.
Better still, go outside
and wait in the car.
Well, it's a long drive
back to London,
so the sooner we
can get started, the better.
Siegfried,
what do you ask
of the Church of God?
Faith.
What does faith offer you?
Life everlasting.
If you then desire
to enter into life,
keep the commandments.
"Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with thy whole heart
"and with thy whole soul
and with thy whole mind."
Siegfried,
do you renounce Satan?
I do renounce him.
And all his works?
I do renounce him.
And all his pomps?
I do renounce him.
Receive this burning light
and keep thy baptism
so as to be without blame.
Keep the commandments of God,
that when the Lord
shall come to the nuptials,
thou mayest meet Him
together with all the Saints
in the heavenly court,
and mayest thou have eternal
life for ever and ever.
Siegfried, go in peace
and the Lord be with you.
The fool hath said in his
heart there is no God.
You will be drawn up
in your feelings
above understanding
to the radiance
of divine darkness
that transcends all being.
Christ, receive my soul
and release me from
the imprisonment of doubt.
And grant me peace.
I'm quite appalled
by what you've done.
I can only hope
your CO in Liverpool
will ignore your letter.
I'm terrified that you will
be put under arrest.
We read your statement,
Lieutenant, with some alarm.
You may sit
if you wish, Lieutenant.
Thank you, sir.
Why did you make it?
I wanted to state my position
regarding the conduct
of the war.
It is not your place to question
how the war is being prosecuted.
Your duty lies
in obeying orders.
Duty?
That word covers
a multitude of sins.
In the face of such slaughter,
one cannot simply
order one's conscience.
One can do better than that.
One can ignore it.
That reply was so disgraceful,
you ought to be in politics.
That was impertinent,
Lieutenant.
Are you pro-German?
No. I'm pro-human.
We are not here
to discuss humanity,
that is religion's sphere
of operations.
And what of morality?
Morality is a luxury
that we can only afford
during peace time.
I would be very grateful
if you would take
that offensive tone
out of your voice.
Voices raised in anger
only perpetuates war.
And passive resistance
only invites defeat.
I simply cannot remain silent
in the face of such casualties.
Someone must,
should be brought to book.
The casualties, young man,
are a matter for the
Imperial General Staff.
And your statement,
indeed your entire attitude,
is both offensive
and detrimental
to military discipline.
My colleague is quite right.
It is not your place
to question your superiors,
much less to imply
that they are not honourable.
Perhaps, sir,
if you, if any of you
were to visit the front,
then you might at least
spare a thought
for the many bereaved families
and the pain they suffer.
You are out of order, sir!
I thought that was
the very reason
for my being brought before you.
This has gone far enough.
Yes, of course.
Yes, I agree.
Myself and my fellow officers
feel that your mind
is still in chaos
and that you are unfit to be
trusted with men's lives.
It is therefore
the Board's decision
that you should
be sent to a hospital
for nervous diseases
in Scotland.
We therefore order you
to report immediately
to Craiglockhart, in Edinburgh.
Good morning, Lieutenant.
You may leave your coat
and luggage here.
A porter will take them
up to your room.
Name?
Sassoon, Siegfried.
Rank?
- Second Lieutenant.
- Age?
30.
Years of complete service?
Two years, eleven months.
Completed months
with Field Force?
Thirteen months.
Disease?
I've had some sort of breakdown.
Nervous debility?
Yes, I believe
that's what they call it.
Enter it as
neurasthenia, Matron.
As we came in, sir,
I noticed several men
with blue dots on their faces.
Morphine.
Morphine?
The dots denote that
they've had their doses,
so that they are given no more
until the appropriate time.
Who will be treating this man?
- Doctor Rivers.
- Rivers' office is next door.
I think it would be polite
if you introduced yourself.
Yes, sir.
And in your room,
you will find an armband.
It is to be worn at all times,
especially outside
the hospital grounds.
It is to show that you are
a serving soldier in hospital
and not
a conscientious objector.
We wouldn't want you
to be attacked
in Princes Street,
now, would we?
Which arm
shall I wear it on, sir?
The pleasure of that
choice, Lieutenant,
is entirely yours.
Your room is on the upper floor
at the end of the corridor.
Dismissed.
Hmm?
Sassoon, Siegfried, Lieutenant.
Your burgeoning fame
precedes you.
I enjoyed The Old Huntsman
very much.
You may not know,
but we have
a house magazine, The Hydra.
I'm sure it would welcome
a contribution from you.
Well, I'll, erm,
try to write something
light and amusing.
Oh, there's no need
to go that far.
You have an appointment to see
me at 10:30 in the morning.
Dear Mother,
have arrived in Dottyville.
Wish you were here.
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning, Sassoon.
Please, sit down.
We're quite relaxed here.
Although we do seem
to go through
rather too many
chief medical officers,
some are more flexible
than others.
Then they're replaced by someone
who wants everything
to be as taut as Aldershot.
Then they too are replaced.
And what's your persuasion?
Oh, I prefer a certain
measure of laxity.
One can't be
at attention forever,
it plays havoc with the nerves.
From the, er, little I know of
your method of treatment here,
I understand that
from whatever I say
you can deduce whether or not
my grandmother
was a dipsomaniac.
Was she?
Alas, no, no.
Just a sweet sherry at
Christmas and on birthdays.
Well done, your grandmother.
She didn't know
what she wasn't missing.
Well, just tell me whatever
it is you want me to do,
and I'll comply
with your wishes.
It isn't a question
of what I want.
It's a question
of what you think you need.
Am I to start? Or do you?
Is there anything you feel
you wish to say?
What I feel cannot be talked
away or soothed into silence.
Why?
Too many have died.
Too much has been destroyed.
There can be
an easement of pain.
A move towards acceptance.
Pain is not the only terror.
There are many more.
Can you name them?
If I could name them, they
would cease to be terrors.
That's a very elegant way
of avoiding an answer.
All evasions are elegant.
Think of politics.
I've always thought
that politicians
were too stupid to be subtle.
Perhaps they're just
too subtle to be inelegant.
Are you a good soldier?
Passable.
I was a poor marksman.
I never knew which eye to shut.
I understand you were
awarded the MC.
Yes.
It's supposed
to signify gallantry.
Bravery is only cowardice
in extremis.
At the root of bravery
lies terror
and the fear of fear.
But you were conspicuous
by your courage.
Why did you discard
the Military Cross?
Disgust at my own
dwindling standards
and the men I felt
I had betrayed.
It was nothing short
of duplicity.
And yet the men
under your command
held you in the highest
esteem, I'm told.
And I them.
They seemed to me to be all
that was good and true
in this world.
Are you searching for truth?
Isn't everyone?
And if you find it,
what then?
Peace of mind, contentment.
No longer yearning
for what's been lost.
Loveliest of trees
The cherry now
Is hung with bloom
Along the bough
And stands about
The woodland ride
Wearing white
For Eastertide
Come in.
Lieutenant Sassoon?
Yes.
I'm Wilfred Owen.
There was howling last night.
Like a wolf.
Strictly speaking,
wolves ululate.
But howling will do.
Now, don't make light of it
like that, Doctor, please.
That isn't what I'm doing.
I'm merely keeping it
in perspective.
I'm sorry if I sounded uncaring.
His screams were terrible.
Worse than an animal.
Such anguish in them.
Why do all the worst terrors
come at night?
The night is, I think,
like the unconscious.
Waiting all day so that it can
steal over you in the dark.
You make it sound almost benign.
Perhaps it is.
I believe Wilfred Owen
introduced himself to you
the other day.
Yes.
He seems so gentle.
Feel rather protective of him.
Does that protectiveness
hide something deeper?
Yes.
All my friendships do.
But I've never allowed my
emotions to mar or spoil them,
I remain passive.
It's how I cope.
You never act on impulse?
No, never.
I'm unable to take risks.
It's the hero in me.
Why not?
Too afraid,
too inhibited.
Shamed by an inner corruption.
Or perhaps
it's simply because of...
What's the phrase?
"The love that dare not
speak its name."
You are not alone
in that respect.
Frankly, Doctor, I'm surprised.
Why?
The world is full of anomalies.
Well, speaking as
one anomaly to another,
how do you cope with the law?
I adopt a less than honest
respect for it.
So evasion is not confined
solely to second lieutenants?
No, it affects all ranks.
I trust after this disclosure,
you will be discreet.
Discretion is my middle name.
Well, it's better
than Ethel anyway.
One assumes these theatricals
have some deeper purpose.
Well, sir, I think
they help to give
some sort of ease
away from the front line.
I doubt that.
Should the enemy perceive
that the British Army is
always preparing for a tango,
the war is lost.
Besides, the spectacle of men
dancing with men
is never palatable.
I had always thought
such creatures
went into the library
with their service revolvers
and did the decent thing.
And how is your treatment
progressing, Lieutenant?
Oh, it has
its unique moments, sir.
Well, let us hope
these unique moments
coalesce enough to get you
back to active service,
fighting fit, as it were.
Doesn't that rather depend, sir,
on what's fit to fight for?
But perhaps
I'm just being syndromatic.
Or is that a lapsus linguae?
I beg your pardon?
Lapsus linguae, sir.
Slip of the tongue.
I know what it means,
Lieutenant.
The rest of us may be unable
to read Beowulf in the original,
but we're not all
complete Philistines.
Of course not, sir.
Carry on.
- Ready?
- Yes.
Halitosis!
Halitosis!
Your first poem in Hydra.
Long live the editor!
I am the editor.
Hooray for nepotism!
And what do you think
of my verse, Siegfried?
It seemed a little too dependent
on 19th century models.
You make it sound like
The Courtship of Miles Standish.
Oh, God, no.
Nothing's ever as bad as that.
But you do find
my work derivative?
While I was at Clare,
I wasted far too much time
reading Swinburne.
It was very bad
for my adjectives.
You have to speak directly,
not with another's voice.
Look, at first,
everyone's work is derivative.
We all have to start somewhere.
At Cambridge,
apart from Swinburne,
I did nothing except read
William Morris in a punt
and staggered through Maud.
Perhaps, er, my latest effort
will please you.
It's called Disabled.
It's magnificent.
It pierces the heart.
What a gift you have.
I have been passed
by the Medical Board
as fit for active service.
When do you rejoin
your regiment?
December.
Just before Christmas.
Oh.
There was I
waiting at the church
Waiting at the church
Waiting at the church
When I found
he left me in the lurch
Lord, how it did upset me
All at once
he sent me round a note
Here's the very note
This is what he wrote
"Can't get away
to marry you today
"My wife won't let me"
There was I
Waiting at the church
Waiting at the church
Waiting at the church
When I found
he left me in the lurch
Lord, how it did upset me
All at once
he sent me round a note
Here's the very note
This is what he wrote
"Can't get away
to marry you today
"My wife won't let me"
What is it, Siegfried?
Nothing.
Wilfred's about to return
to duty.
I know.
What will you do?
Nothing.
I will not do anything to make
the parting even more painful.
I'd give everything I possess
to have him stay
just one more hour.
One more minute.
Quick to tears, slow to love.
You know, when I first met him,
he had a slight stammer.
And spoke, I thought,
with a grammar school accent.
How could I be such a snob?
He really is a lovely man.
And I think the greater poet.
What about your poetry?
It's egotism, really.
That seems a little harsh.
Truth often is.
I have no idea why I come here.
It's really done
no good at all, this.
Think of it as a cleansing
of the soul.
Why do you have
to put it so beautifully?
Will you stay just
for a few more moments?
Yes.
Whenever you're ready, sir.
Wilfred was killed
just a week
before the war ended.
What passing-bells
for these who die as cattle?
Only the monstrous anger
of the guns.
Only the stuttering rifles'
rapid rattle
can patter out
their hasty orisons.
No mockeries for them
from prayers or bells,
nor any voice of mourning,
save the choir's.
The shrill, demented choirs
of wailing shells
and bugles calling for them
from sad shires.
What candles may be held
to speed them all?
Not in the hands of boys,
but in their eyes
shall shine the holy glimmers
of goodbyes.
The pallor of girls' brows
shall be their pall,
their flowers, the tenderness
of silent minds,
and each slow dusk
a drawing-down of blinds.
The woman posing, who appears
to be wearing a spinnaker
is Lady Ottoline Morrell.
More hair than self-restraint,
but definitely nobody's fool.
She looks as though
she hasn't heard a joke
since the Boer War.
For Ottoline, the Boer War
was the joke.
Ottoline.
May we pause
for a moment, Dorothy,
- before rigor mortis sets in?
- Of course, Ottoline.
Who is this extremely
beautiful young man, Robbie?
Sassoon, Siegfried.
It sounds Wagnerian.
It's just Home Counties,
I'm afraid.
So you are not a keeper
of the flame at Bayreuth?
No, no, I'm afraid not.
What are your
musical tastes then?
Er, Ravel, Albeniz, Chausson.
Scriabin, if I must.
Cesar Franck,
when I'm in the mood.
And Bartok?
Oh, no. Never Bartok, no.
His music always sounds to me
like a lunatic
playing the xylophone.
Vice versa.
I once heard Paderewski play
Bartok at Tunbridge Wells,
but I found it
rather disappointing.
Well, what did you
expect, Robbie?
It was Tunbridge Wells.
Come into the main house
and have tea.
May I join you, Ottoline?
Of course. Dorothy,
you are not a servant,
but an honourable.
Now come along, Mr Bassoon,
and tell me what you really
have against Mr Bartok.
Not a great deal.
I just don't like his music.
Oh, a word into your shell-like,
she'll ask you
to stay the night.
She always asks attractive
young men to stay the night.
So lock your bedroom door
or wear something
very, very severe.
I thought that I might be
more interesting than cocoa.
I'm afraid I prefer cocoa.
Sleep badly.
Dickie. Curse
the Wood! It's time to go.
O Christ, what's the good?
We'll never take it,
and it's always raining.
They snipe like hell!
O Dickie, don't go out!
I fell asleep.
Next morning, he was dead.
And some slight wound
lay smiling on the bed.
Ivor Novello...
of Keep The Home-Fires Burning
fame.
Hmm, yes.
That loathsome little tune.
Ah, he always writes
at the top of his voice,
but we must try
to be charitable.
Ah, Sybil, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.
Ragtime indeed.
Yes, I know.
But Mr Novello plays it
so well, it's almost music.
Besides, at the moment,
he's appearing in the West End
in a very successful play
called The Rat.
I know.
Someone asked me
if it was autobiographical,
but I said I wasn't sure.
One day, Robbie,
you will go too far.
Oh, one day, Sybil,
we will all go too far.
Thank you for coming,
Mr Sassoon.
We're all very eager
to hear your recitation.
Thank you, Lady Colefax.
Ladies and gentlemen,
pray silence for
one of our greatest poets,
Mr Siegfried Sassoon.
When I'm among
a blaze of lights,
with tawdry music and cigars
and women dawdling
through delights
and officers in cocktail bars,
sometimes I think
of garden nights
and elm trees
nodding at the stars.
I dream of a small
fire-lit room.
Yellow candles burning straight,
and glowing pictures
in the gloom,
and kindly books
that hold me late.
Of things like these
I choose to think
when I can never be alone.
And then someone says,
"Another drink,"
and turns my living heart
to stone.
Hmm.
Thank you, Mr Sassoon.
That was very touching.
We both thank you, Sybil,
and now go
and rejoin Lady Cunard
before she starts
launching something.
And to think he once played
the triangle so beautifully.
What a waste.
I seem to be
the victim of a cruel jest
It dogs my footsteps with
the girl I love the best
She's just the sweetest thing
that I have ever known
And yet we never get
the chance to be alone
My car will meet her
and her mother comes, too
It's a two-seater
Still her mother comes, too
At Ciro's when I am free
at dinner, supper or tea
She loves to shimmy with me
And her mother does, too
We buy her trousseau
And her mother comes, too
Asked not to do so
Still her mother comes, too
She simply can't take a snub
I go and sulk at the club
Then have a bath and a rub
And her brother comes, too
To golf we started
And her mother came, too
Three bags I carted
When her mother came, too
She fainted just off the tee
My darling whispered to me
"Jack dear, at last we are free"
But her mother came, too
He is considered very beautiful.
Look at those shoulders.
Yeah, and look at his.
Are we leaving, Ivor?
No, precious.
I'm anxious to meet
our distinguished guest,
Mr Sassoon.
I'm eager to have your advice
on my next musical.
I'm thinking of writing
in terza rima.
That's near Naples, isn't it?
Oh, dear Robbie,
whose silences are always
so much more eloquent
than speech.
Robbie will give you a paw
to guide you home, Glen.
C'est la vie.
C'est la guerre.
Oops.
Just leave the keys
on the dresser, Glen.
You know how absent-minded
I am with them.
I think he's still
in love with you.
The main drawback with love
is that it descends,
all too quickly,
into possessiveness.
That really is a bore.
What shall I do with these?
Oh, they're for you.
Hamo died so far away.
While I have his sword,
I still have him.
We never grieved
properly for him, Mother.
Before grief, there's anger.
I watch you
on your constant way,
in selfless duty
long grown grey.
And to myself,
I say that I have
lived my life to learn
how lives like your
unasking earn.
Aureoles that guide and burn
in heart's remembrance
when the proud who snared
the suffrage of the crowd
are dumb and dusty browed.
For you live onward
in my thought
because you have not sought
rewards that can be bought.
And so when I remember you,
I think of all things
rich and true
that I have reaped and wrought.
Thank God you survived.
Good night, darling.
Good night, Mother.
Give me your hand, my brother.
Search my face.
Look in these eyes
lest I should think of shame.
For we have made an end
of all things base.
We are returning
by the road we came.
Your lot is with the ghosts
of soldiers dead,
and I am in the field
where men must fight.
But in the gloom,
I see your laurelled head
and through your victory
I shall win the light.
Sleep in heavenly peace
3,500 copies of
Counter-Attack sold.
Your fame
is spreading, Siegfried.
Like a virus?
Oh, don't be contrary.
So I wake up famous.
Like Byron.
And I believe you've
been overwhelmed
by visits from all the great
and the good.
Mmm.
Massine, Lydia Lopokova, Keynes,
Winston Churchill and mother.
Even "boy actor" Noel Coward.
Have I left anyone out?
The Pope.
That's right, Siegfried,
think small.
How did you find Mr Churchill?
Imperial.
And Mr Coward?
Gushing.
What would you have done
if Royalty had paid a call?
Oh, well, then I'd
have tried to curtsey
from a sitting position.
Speaking of Royalty,
I've come with a command
from Her Majesty Edith Sit well.
You are to attend a performance
at Carlyle Square
of her Entertainment-FaÃ§ade.
Poetry, by Edith.
Music, Willie Walton.
I've gone
to a great deal of trouble
to get this
so don't let me down.
If you don't attend, La Sit well
has threatened
to come to your flat
at Half Moon Street
and hum the whole
of Tannhauser to you.
You have been warned.
Oh, I, er...
Ottoline Morell popped in
and wished to be
remembered to you.
How was she?
Let's just say I've always
found lime green
a very unforgiving colour.
Poor Ottoline.
She'll go to her grave
overdressed.
I'm looking forward
to meeting your mother.
What?
I said I was looking forward
to meeting your mother.
All mothers, good or bad
are always fascinating.
I tried to set fire
to mine once,
but she was all asbestos.
Oh, do come on!
We shall never get down
to Kent at this rate.
Oh, and I found this
for you on the floor.
Oh, it'll be from Robbie Ross.
Why are you so antipathetic
towards him?
Because I resent the way
that he speaks to me.
Like he's always
putting me in my place.
You know, the only problem
with knowing one's place
is that other people
never seem to know theirs.
He's acerbic, I grant you,
but he's never malign,
and as a friend, very steadfast.
Robbie Ross took
some considerable risk
when he publicly supported
Oscar Wilde.
He's been hounded ever since
by Lord Alfred Douglas.
Oh, please,
Bosie was always vindictive.
Robbie should have known that
from the beginning.
He's really only got
himself to blame.
That's really unfair.
His loyalty to Wilde
was exemplary.
All right, all right.
Robbie's a saint.
Now, how about
we drop the subject?
Oh, that's a very fine sword.
It was my brother's.
Hmm.
He was killed at Gallipoli.
Oh, God.
What is it?
It's the first performance
of FaÃ§ade,
and I was supposed to go to it.
Well, where's it
being performed?
Some private performance
in Carlyle Square.
Chelsea.
Well, even if we drove
like the wind,
we should never make it.
Robbie will be furious.
And so will Edith Sit well.
It's being given
to a very select audience.
I'm sure she'll understand
once you explain
why you weren't able
to be there.
Oh, no,
I don't think so, Mother.
Edith can be a very
captious woman.
She isn't a woman.
She's an animated meringue.
And those teeth.
Don't be horrible, Ivor.
She suffers, I believe,
from a complaint
known as receding gums.
She's so autocratic,
I'm surprised she gave
them permission to.
Oh, well, come along then.
Might as well see
if we can catch some of it.
I'm sorry to have to rush off
like this, Mother.
It doesn't matter.
Is he just another one
of your pretty boys?
No, it's deeper than that,
much deeper.
You don't like him,
do you, Mother?
He's amusing, but unpleasant.
It's his eyes.
I think they're cruel.
Good night, Mother.
Good night, Siegfried.
You never came.
Please forgive me, Edith.
I shall try.
I'm entirely to blame.
We visited my mother
in Kent and I simply
lost all sense of time.
- We?
- Mmm.
Myself and Ivor Novello.
A man at the cheaper end
of poetry.
I do hope you can
forgive me, Edith,
for I am mortified
by my thoughtlessness.
How was the work received?
They tittered.
Tittered?
Tittered.
I overheard someone say,
in the most odious manner,
"It's this sort of thing
"that makes one glad
to be semi-conscious."
- I was deeply wounded.
- Hmm.
My poetry has wonderful
assonances and dissonances.
I use words for their colour,
not merely for what
they are supposed to mean.
Great art may sometimes be
so ahead of its time, Edith,
that its initial reception
can be considered
a succÃ¨s d'estime.
Think of Stravinsky.
But I do not wish
to think of Stravinsky.
We are performing FaÃ§ade
at the Aeolian Hall next week.
I shall expect you there.
Of course, Edith.
I shall come with the speed
of a thousand gazelles.
No need for hyperbole,
Siegfried.
A taxi will do.
In the early springtime
after their tea,
through the young fields
of the springing Bohea,
Jemima, Jocasta, Dinah and Deb
walked with their father
Sir Joshua Jebb.
An admiral red
whose only notion,
a butterfly poised
on a pigtailed ocean
is of the peruked sea
whose swell
breaks on the flowerless rocks
of Hell.
For Hell is just
as properly proper,
as Greenwich, or as Bath,
or Joppa!
Oh, Christ!
I have to go backstage.
Rather you than me.
Ah.
The prodigal.
Well, Edith,
you've done it again.
All the fine young cannibals.
You make it sound
like a raiding party.
Isn't it?
Stephen Tennant.
I am...
Yes, we already know
who you are, Stephen.
But who is this absolute dream
in oyster grey silk?
Hester Gatty.
Lady Gatty's daughter?
Yes.
She once invited you
to Carlton House Terrace.
But you hardly noticed me.
Then I apologize
for my lack of taste.
We're great admirers
of your poetry, Siegfried.
Before you take of fence, Ivor,
we like your work, too.
Careful, Stephen,
that was almost enthusiasm.
Perhaps they will play
one of your charming songs,
Mr Novello, and then
we can dance to it.
I can't tempt Stephen, though.
Why not?
Because I only do the valeta
and only when pressed.
I do love dancing.
So do I.
Come on, then.
Whoo!
I didn't know great poets
did the Charleston.
I didn't know the Charleston
did that to gay young things.
I think everyone should
be gay, don't you?
Only in the wider sense.
And this young man is...
Alexander Fenton.
Doesn't it sound as though
it should have a title
in front of it?
Sir Alexander Fenton.
For his services to the theatre.
Well, that hasn't happened yet.
It will, Ivor.
It will.
I hardly see you
these days, Ivor.
How are you?
Horizontally speaking.
Oh, busy, old thing.
Very, very busy.
Still gathering lilacs?
You could say that.
Well, when you've
exhausted botany,
you might consider moving
into the field of blood sports.
I'm told that the men
who indulge in them
are very, very rugged.
Isn't that so, Mr Sassoon?
You know, I think that's what
I'm going to miss most
about you, Glen,
your quaint sense of humour.
And how have you been
passing your time?
Seeing lots of musical theatre.
Mmm, such as?
Rose-Marie, very enjoyable.
Yes, but so Rudolph Friml-ly.
But it is by Rudolph Friml.
It was a joke, Siegfried.
And how about tonight?
Lady, Be Good!
Gershwin, an unsurpassed genius.
Oh, we really mustn't
keep you then, Glen.
You have to admit it,
Gershwin is an
exceptional talent.
I don't have to admit anything.
What's wrong?
We're leaving.
But I thought you wanted supper.
I'm no longer hungry!
Name, sir?
Mr Sassoon.
Sassoon, you say.
- Yes.
- Oh.
Hmm.
Would you mind spelling it
for me, please, sir?
S-A-S-S-O-O-N.
Hmm.
I'm afraid you're not
on the list, sir.
Well, I'm going up anyway.
Telephone me in a couple
of days, won't you?
I practically
had to force my way in
past the stage doorman.
Hmm. You were lucky.
He's been told to shoot anyone
not on my list.
Why wasn't I on the list?
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Look, it's been
a long run, Siegfried.
I am tired.
I am exhausted.
- You still want supper?
- Yes!
I'm surprised to see
Fenton here.
Why?
I know lots of people.
- Fenton is just another...
- Admirer.
...fan.
You both seemed to me
to be very friendly
after so short an acquaintance.
Now, I get the
distinct impression
that I am being grilled.
And that a storm
in an egg cup is brewing.
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to be petty, but I am...
I am very jealous of you.
Yes, well,
affairs are always messy.
Who can know the secrets
of a human heart?
Usually the people
who don't have one.
Oh, my, my,
hasn't it gone chilly in here?
But I love you.
Yes,
you've said.
Ivor.
Ivor.
Let me pass.
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't let you go up.
Why?
Mr Novello never sees anyone
after a matinee.
Well, would you please
inform Mr Novello
that I've booked a table
for 8 PM?
And I'll be
expecting him for dinner!
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Is there someone else?
There's always someone else.
How do you justify
your behaviour?
By asking myself questions
to which I already
know the answers.
And when all is said and done,
my career comes before anyone
or anything.
And my work
is as popular as I am.
There is a school of thought
that regards musical theatre
as a second-rate
means of expression.
Before you judge other
people's work, Siegfried,
I would make sure
your own is above criticism.
- What does that mean?
- Just this,
that since 1918,
your poetry has gone
from the sublime
to the meticulous.
And tell me, Mr Novello,
what did you do during the war?
I gave my talent to my country.
I boosted morale by playing
every theatre in the land!
Oh, weren't you the lucky one!
We had the Somme
and you had Rhyl!
Well, I see no point
in prolonging
this unpleasant conversation.
No.
Oh, no.
After what's been said,
I don't expect you
to foot the bill as well.
Oh, always the gentleman,
eh, Siegfried?
It's better than being a cad.
I suspect this is goodbye then.
Au revoir
might have been kinder.
Please don't undermine
yourself, Siegfried.
That's what friends are for.
If you wish to see me again,
I'll be at my flat.
Well, at least
that's more original
than going home to mother.
Snap.
May I sit down?
Yes, of course.
Do you still dine here?
- Of course.
- Why?
Let's just say I like
the trips down memory lane.
What next?
Well, I suppose, in a bad
melodrama, I'd kill myself.
And in a really bad melodrama,
you kill Ivor.
Seriously, are you all right?
The moment passes,
but the hurt remains.
And I was supposed to go
and visit my mother
and now I've missed the train.
Drive down, why don't you?
I have no car. I can't drive.
I was going to motor
down to the coast.
Why don't I give you a lift?
That would be very kind of you.
Where does she live?
Kent.
Then let's get going.
I have absolutely
no idea where we are.
Although I, erm,
don't possess the wit to woo,
may I see you again?
I live in Margate.
Oh.
Pity Margate is so far away.
It's not at the moment.
What about Ivor?
Oh.
Ivor's already been to Margate.
At dawn, the ridge
emerges massed and dun
in wild purple
of the glow'ring sun,
smouldering through spouts
of drifting smoke
that shroud the menacing
scarred slope.
And, one by one,
tanks creep and topple
forward to the wire.
The barrage roars and lifts.
Then, clumsily bowed with bombs
and guns and battle-gear,
men jostle and climb
to meet the bristling fire.
Lines of grey, muttering
faces, masked with fear,
they leave their trenches,
going over the top,
while time ticks blank
and busy on their wrists,
and hope, with furtive eyes
and grappling fists,
flounders in the mud.
O Jesus, make it stop.
We have a guest.
Oh, he's not a guest.
He's an afterthought.
This is my life partner,
Bobby Andrews.
Bobby, Siegfried.
Siegfried, Bobby.
Well, don't look so shocked.
Love has nothing
to do with monogamy.
Or are you the faithful type?
I suppose I must be.
If you want fidelity,
Siegfried, buy a pet.
You kept very quiet about this.
Well, that's because
I didn't want anyone else
to shake him down from the tree.
You really are a bastard,
aren't you?
I do my best.
Now you must excuse us.
We have a casserole waiting.
Oh.
Where shall I put your key?
Back on the floor.
I can't face tea before 11 AM.
Drink it, you misery.
I don't do this for everyone,
you know.
I'm the invalid, remember?
Like Chekhov.
Oh, what should I do
about my hair?
Have you considered topiary?
I think I might dye it.
Or I could leave it
in its natural colour.
When I'm sun burnt,
it looks like spun gold.
I'll be with you in a moment.
It's Glen Byam Shaw.
Isn't that good news?
Siggy will be down in a trice.
He's suitably undressed.
We've just been
talking about you.
So I hope your ears
were burning,
all three of them.
Is Stephen naturally unpleasant
or does he take private tuition?
I heard that!
You were supposed to.
Siggy! Siggy!
I'm sorry.
What can I say?
There's nothing to say.
It's one of the inconveniences
of the shadow life we lead.
Friends may come,
friends may go.
Enemies are always faithful.
How is Ivor?
I have no idea.
I don't see him any more.
Did you know about Bobby?
Yes.
You might have warned me.
I didn't want
to seem vindictive.
Sour grapes and all that.
I wanted to tell you personally
that I'm planning to marry.
She's an actress
and a good sort,
I think, and we're very
fond of each other.
When did you decide?
Some months ago.
You should give
a thought to it, too.
No, if the intention
wasn't pure,
I don't think
I could go through it.
Purity is like virginity.
As soon as you touch it,
it becomes corrupt.
I hope you both
will be very happy.
Thank you, Siegfried.
I shall do my best.
What's the matter? TB?
You should have told me.
Why?
There's nothing
you can do about it.
I could have taken you
somewhere,
to a warmer, drier climate.
That rules out Frinton then.
Is there somewhere
we can go to help you?
Yes.
I've been there before.
In Germany.
Haus Hirt in Bavaria.
All cow bells, lederhosen
and very, very thick thighs.
So idyllic,
you'll want to scream.
But the German men...
Gorgeous!
I wonder what the
collective noun for them is.
Oh, don't look so glum, Siggy.
I'm not about to join
the Hitler Youth.
Yes. Who is it?
Hello, Siegfried,
it's Alexander.
Is Stephen there?
- Hello?
- Don't call here again.
It was Fenton.
I don't like this at all.
We bumped into each other
on Piccadilly the other day.
We had a harmless drink
and I gave him your number.
Don't do it again!
If that were a request,
I might consider it.
If it's an order, I'll make
a point of disobeying it.
What did Glen want?
He's getting married.
The ultimate capitulation.
I'm sure they'll be very happy.
She's probably
as mediocre as he is.
You'll be doing it next.
Thought I'd try my hand
at some watercolours.
- Hmm.
- Landscapes and things.
It's the Magritte in me.
This is not a pipe.
Rene will be pleased.
How would you describe
your style?
Erratic.
But then I'm giving this
to a friend
whom I really detest.
You don't remember me
at all, do you?
The spa?
Ivor Novello? Stephen Tennant?
Oh, yes, of course.
Yes.
The oyster grey silk.
You're supposed to
remember me, not the dress.
Before I met you for the first
time, I'd always thought
you'd be either mercurial
or dark.
And what am I,
dark or mercurial?
Oh, neither.
You're more opaque, I think.
So what brings you down here?
I... I should like to say
the picturesque,
but it wouldn't be true.
I came down in the hope
of seeing you again.
I used the painting as a ploy.
Oh.
Well, I'm touched.
No one's ever used subterfuge
before in order to see me.
It's the modern thing,
liberated woman and all that.
It would be very pleasant
if you invited me to lunch.
It would be very pleasant
if you accepted.
You really are very lovely.
May I kiss you?
You don't have to ask.
I've never had an affair
with a woman.
Only men.
Stephen told me
all I needed to know.
All my life, I feel as though
I've been waiting
for a catastrophe to happen.
Well, that's optimism for you.
My whole future
could depend on you.
You must redeem
my life for me, Hester.
That sounds like
some sort of proposal.
If I was selfish enough,
I'd ask you to marry me.
If I were foolish enough,
I'd accept.
Oh, I look 500 years old.
Some say I am beautiful.
And, as an aesthete,
I feel that beauty is eternal.
We see it in the eyes
of those who love us.
Although my mother thinks
that my eyes
are like cold seawater.
My buttocks and my shoulders
are very well-shaped.
But my best feature
is the beauty of my hands.
Almond milk and lemon creams
are perfect for them,
and one must never
laugh too much.
It coarsens one's face,
especially if the laughter
is gleeful.
Stephen, how can you
be so narcissistic?
It is my defence against
nihilism and the vulgar.
You cannot conduct a life
in that way.
Course one can.
My life is my art.
Yours isn't a life,
it's barely a hobby.
That was an ugly thing to say.
I know sometimes it's better
to be kind than honest,
but you are frittering
your life away
in pomades and powder.
And if you don't believe me,
ask someone with more sense
and less love.
You've made your antipathy
to me very obvious.
I don't need a second opinion.
I'm going to Salisbury
for the weekend.
Edith Oliver has found me
a cottage to rent
in Teffont Magna.
I thought we could
spend weekends there.
Will you come?
I, too, have had an invitation.
From whom?
A German prince whom
I think you more than know.
Philip of Hesse, yes.
And one of
Edith Sitwell's proteges.
A concert pianist
called Tchelitchew.
Very Cyrillic, very Russian
and very divine.
And where are you going to?
Paris first.
Then we'll motor down to
Bavaria so I can recuperate
from life.
After Bavaria, they're going
to go on to Venice.
Philip told me that he once
tried to make love in a gondola,
but that there wasn't
enough privacy.
Stability.
Oh.
So it was with you, was it?
You sly old thing.
This all seems very sudden.
Yes, it does, doesn't it?
But then, that's my life.
All go.
Older than God, but without
any of the influence.
Am I welcome, Hester?
Come in and see.
Siegfried.
Stephen.
How dreadful we all look.
But I still have
beautiful hands, I think.
I'll make some tea.
I suppose you've heard
of Ivor's death.
Yes.
They say the funeral attracted
a thousand people.
Probably made up mostly by
all the people he slept with.
I still have a soft spot
for Ivor's work, though.
All those tortured
princesses and lovers
who have no money,
but plenty of sex appeal.
His work was always
sentimental nonsense.
He cheapened everything
he touched.
I've always thought his
particular kind of mawkishness
was a kind of catharsis
for the dimmer members among us.
That's because
you have never known
the difference between the two.
We can't all possess
your purity of thought.
It isn't a question of purity,
but of discernment.
And you were never very good
at discernment.
That was rather too acerbic.
Mordant would be
the more accurate word.
Are you still very angry?
What do you expect?
You ended our relationship
with a letter from your doctor.
How was I supposed to feel?
Still clearly very hurt, I see.
I had hoped that
you might have been
a little more forgiving.
If I had treated you the way
in which you treated me,
how forgiving would you be?
Besides,
when the parade's gone by,
you have to have
enough sense to realize
that you are no longer
a part of it.
I'm trying to apologize.
You're 30 years too late!
Can't we still be friends?
No.
You once meant so much.
Now you mean so little.
- Sieg...
- Don't trivialise it
by saying something glib.
Can I see you again?
In London perhaps?
No!
I rarely go to London now.
And how is George?
Young.
Thriving.
He's like all children.
He has the worst aspects
of both his parents.
How about his parents' virtues?
He's cursed with those as well.
I am...
very lonely, Siggy.
Is it agony?
One does hope so.
George has an independent mind,
which sometimes
shocks Siegfried.
It isn't independence,
it's wilfulness.
Who's died?
All of us.
George, the pipe
was not a good idea.
Looks as if it's smoking you.
Old silver tongue.
We could do without the smoke.
Tea, darling?
No, thank you, Mother.
Thank you for the tea.
George will see you out.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Charming as ever.
But there's still malice
at the edge of his voice,
as there always was.
Sometimes, Siegfried,
it's more humane
to be kind than to be honest.
He constantly goaded
my jealousy.
It was like being killed
by degrees.
He once told me
he thought you were matchless.
We are unique only to the
people who really loathe us.
Will you come
to dinner tonight at Mother's?
She'd have invited God
if she thought He'd come.
I'm uncomfortable
with all that distinction.
I'm not at all an intellectual,
I have a very cumbersome mind.
Oh, please come.
Max Beerbohm said he
might drop in for a drink.
Hmm.
Then I shall come.
Just to hear Max's
delectable gossip.
You know, he, er...
he once described TS Elliot as
"Poor old Tom
who sits there ironically
"analysing
an empty sardine tin."
Well, you better
get your skates on,
and I better get my glad rags
out of mothballs.
Now don't miss me
too much, all right?
Bye!
Goodbye, darlings!
No welcome?
No bunting?
Not even, "You're looking
frightfully well, Stephen."
Am I going to get
the silent treatment?
Or are we going to conduct
the rest of this conversation
entirely in Braille?
Beware the wrath
of a patient man.
Who said that?
Confucius, I think.
On one of his better days.
Well, if you're going to get
all profound on me,
perhaps you could throw in
Ol' Man River as a bonus.
How was Bavaria?
Bavarian.
Did your companion stay long?
Long enough.
And what did you do, Stephen?
Apart from cough?
I... Ooh, what's the phrase?
I lived life to the full.
- All three of you?
- Yes.
It's called troilism, I believe.
- Or an orgy.
- Yes.
That's probably more accurate,
but I won't go into detail.
You know how discreet I am
in these matters.
My spies tell me you've been
seeing a lot of Hester Gatty.
Hester Gatty's been seeing
a lot of me.
I'm beginning to see the light.
A new, secretive you.
Surely you're not jealous?
Of course not.
Now we can all
be girls together.
Like Roedean.
Have you slept with her?
No.
Our relationship is as deep
as it is decorous.
I've even bought myself
some passion-killing pyjamas.
Are you going to marry her?
Yes, I think I probably shall.
You'll make
a vile partner, Siggy.
Perhaps, but then I have
been taught by a master.
You'll be taking a great risk.
I'll be taking the same risk
I took with you.
Couldn't be much worse.
May even be better.
I can see years ahead
for both of you.
Filled with passionless silences
and compulsory cocoa at bedtime.
Oh, by the way,
as we intend to be
living in the country,
I'll be giving up the lease
on this flat.
I didn't want to leave you
in the dark unnecessarily.
But once we've found a house,
you'll have to move out.
That sounds almost
like a threat.
It almost is.
So you're going to throw baby's
little body out into
the cold, cold snow?
No, not immediately, no.
We'll wait for warmer weather.
Can I get you
anything before I leave?
No.
I'll write
once I get to Scotland.
I said I'll write once...
I heard you. I'm trying
to listen to the radio.
- Shall I phone?
- No!
What time's your train, Mother?
Not for an hour.
We've got plenty of time
to get to the station.
I'll come back for you later.
Remember, marry in haste,
repent at leisure.
I was shocked
when you got married
and for exactly the same reason.
And now it's my turn
to be shocked.
I have given you all a bit
of a surprise, haven't I?
- Who's officiating?
- Er, Canon Gay.
Ah.
Oh, I'm sorry, Lawrence,
have you met Glen Byam Shaw?
Glen this is TE Lawrence.
Of Arabia?
Not recently.
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?
I think so.
In the end, we few,
we happy few
are always exogamous.
Christ, what does that mean?
To marry outside
of one's tribe or group.
Do you specialise in using
words no one understands?
Yes. It's my revenge on people
who don't know
what exogamous means.
Have you chosen any music?
No.
Oh, I'm disappointed.
I thought we'd get something
English and dismal.
What are you doing here?
Hester invited me.
I'm her maid of hon our.
The vows that you
are about to take
are to be made
in the presence of God,
who is the judge of all
and knows all the secrets
of our hearts.
Therefore, if either of you
know any reason
why you may not lawfully marry,
you must declare it now.
How are you?
Just very tired.
Is there anything I can get you?
Have you thought of a name?
No.
I thought
we might call him George.
Yes.
My whole future depends on him.
You once said that about me.
Do you want to hold him?
...with homes that are rented
So I have invented my own
Darling, this place
is a lover's oasis
Where life's weary chase
is unknown...
I'm very happy.
And this is the reason.
Cosy to hide in
To live side by side in
Don't let it abide in my dream
Picture me upon your knee
Just tea for two and two for tea
Just me for you and you for me
Alone
Nobody near us
to see us or hear us
No friends or relations
on weekend vacations
We won't have it known, dear
That we own a telephone, dear
Day will break and I'll awake
And start to bake a sugar cake
For you to take
for all the boys to see
We will raise a family
A boy for you, a girl for me
Oh, can't you see
How happy we would be?
How beautifully blue the sky.
The glass is rising very high.
Continue fine I hope it may.
And yet it rained but yesterday.
Tomorrow, it may pour again.
I hear the country
needs some rain.
I stood with the dead.
Come down from Heaven to meet me
when my breath chokes.
And through drumming shafts
of stifling death
I stumble towards escape,
to find the door opening on morn
where I may breathe once more
clear cock-crow airs
across some valley
dim with whispering trees.
While dawn along the rim
of night's horizon
flows in lakes of fire,
come down from
Heaven's bright hill,
my song's desire.
Belov'd and faithful,
teach my soul to wake
in glades deep-ranked
with flowers that gleam
and shake and flock
your paths with wonder.
In your gaze, show me,
the vanquished vigil of my days.
Mute in that golden silence
hung with green,
come down from Heaven
and bring me in your eyes
remembrance of all beauty
that has been.
And stillness from
the pools of Paradise.
Rising,
rising the voices
of the muffled dead.
Are you going to keep
this silence up
for the rest of the day?
Look, I brought you
down to London
because I was worried about you!
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not!
There was no food
in the house! No heating!
And you were sitting there
in the dark
like a Protestant bishop!
- I can manage!
- No, you can't!
If you're going to sulk,
I'm going upstairs.
Turn that rubbish off!
I'll do as I like!
It's my house!
- It's my music!
- That isn't music!
It's commercially
grotesque noise
made by stupid people
for stupid people!
Oh, don't be so bigoted!
The official numbers
of those killed
in the First World War.
The United Kingdom
and its colonies:
1,225,914.
France: 1,697,798.
Germany: 2,476,897.
Austria-Hungary: 1,567,202.
Russia: 3,311,251...
These are
the statistics of catastrophe.
Yet from Prime to Compline,
life goes slowly on.
Are you thinking great thoughts?
No.
Just sitting here being petty.
Trying to understand
the enigma of other people.
So many have died.
Too many.
Most people live for the moment.
You live for eternity.
- Don't say that.
- Why not?
Because I'm afraid
I might believe it.
I would have liked to have
been recognised, though.
In some significant way
for my work.
Eliot got the Order of Merit
and the Nobel Prize.
I've had to make do with
the Queen's Award for Poetry.
But Sir Siegfried Sassoon,
it would have been nice.
- Despite all the sibilants.
- Oh, Father.
How can you be seduced by
all that Ruritanian nonsense?
The greatest argument against
Damehoods and Knighthoods is...
Just look at the people
who've got them.
Why do you hate
the modern world, Father?
Because it's younger than I am.
Well, you've got to bathe
and change.
We're going to the theatre,
remember?
Do I have to?
Yes, you promised.
Besides, it's a witty
and elegant score.
Even you might enjoy it.
I'm sorry I shouted.
It's... So am I.
Peace?
Peace.

I'm a typically English rose
But born of typically
English stock
With a typically Anglo-Saxon
family tree
I received my education
from a typically English way
In a typically
English girl's academy
I play typically English tennis
At a typically English club
With my typically
English feelings for fair play
I eat typically English crumpets
With my typically English tea
At the end
of every typically English day
Father is a typically

Home is a typically

Mummy and I play
typically English patients
As the typically English rain
is pouring down
With a typically English spaniel
Who likes typically

Cause there's typically
English trees
Upon the heath
And if anyone asked me
How I like
this typically English life
I am fed up
to my typically English tea
Shall we take a cab?
No, I'll walk home.
Are you sure?
It's getting very chilly.
I'd rather walk.
Perhaps my latest
effort will please you.
It's called Disabled.
I'll come and get you.
Thank you.
He sat in a wheeled chair,
waiting for dark
and shivered in his ghastly
suit of grey, legless,
sewn short at elbow.
Through the park,
voices of boys rang
saddening like a hymn.
Voices of play and pleasure
after day.
Till gathering sleep
had mothered them from him.
About this time,
town used to swing so gay
when glow-lamps budded
in the light blue trees,
and girls glanced lovelier
as the air grew dim
in the old times,
before we threw away his knees.
Now he will never feel again
how slim girls' waists are
or how warm their subtle hands.
All of them touch him
like some queer disease.
There was an artist
silly for his face,
for it was younger
than his youth, last year.
Now he is old,
his back will never brace.
He's lost his colour
very far from here.
Poured it down shell-holes
till the veins ran dry,
and half his lifetime lapsed
in the hot race.
And leap of purple
spurted from his thigh.
One time he liked
a blood-smear down his leg,
after the matches
carried shoulder-high.
It was after football
when he'd drunk a peg,
he thought he'd better join.
He wonders why.
Someone had said
he'd looked a god in kilts.
That's why.
And maybe, too,
to please his Meg.
Aye, that was it,
to please the giddy jilts,
he'd asked to join.
He didn't have to beg.
Smiling they wrote his lie:
aged 19 years.
Germans he scarcely
thought of, all their guilt,
and Austria's, did not move him.
And no fears of fear came yet.
He thought of jewel led hilts
for daggers in plaid socks,
of smart salutes,
and care of arms, and leave,
and pay arrears,
esprit de corps,
and hints for young recruits.
And soon, he was drafted out
with drums and cheers.
Some cheered him home,
but not as crowds cheer goal.
Only a solemn man who brought
him fruits thanked him.
And then inquired
about his soul.
Now he will spend a few
sick years in institutes
and do what things
the rules consider wise,
and take whatever pity
they may dole.
Tonight he noticed
how women's eyes
passed from him to the
strong men who were whole.
How cold and late it is.
Why don't they come
and put him into bed?
Why don't they come?
$&$Call me by yout name$&$
The usurper.
Caro? He's here.
- Professor Perlman.
- Welcome, welcome.
- Thank you so much for having me.
- Oh, my goodness.
You're bigger than your picture.
Well, I couldn't get
all of me in the photo.
That's the problem.
He seems very confident.
- Mrs. Perlman.
- Annella.
Oliver. Very nice to meet you.
- Thank you for having me in your home.
- Welcome.
Where's Elio?
I'll go down.
Elio?
- You must be exhausted.
- What gave me away?
Hey.
Darling, come help Oliver
take his things up to his room.
- He's already here?
- Yes!
Every single one of these will.
Elio, Oliver. Oliver, Elio.
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you. Elio.
You must be exhausted.
- A little bit.
- Come, come, come.
May I bring your things up to your room?
- Sure. Yeah.
- My room?
Follow him.
- You're very welcome here.
- Si.
Our home is your home.
You're leaving?
- Hello.
- Hi.
Nice to meet you.
My room is now your room.
I'll be next door.
We have to share the bathroom.
It's my only way out.
We're being called for dinner.
Sorry.
Yeah.
We're being called for dinner.
Yeah, I'm probably gonna pass.
Will you make an excuse for me
to your mom, though?
Thanks, man.
So, this is your old room, huh?
Thanks.
Later.
I'll take care of the tart.
Look at this.
Good morning, Professor.
- Good morning.
- Back from the dead.
- Was I out that long?
- It seemed like it, huh?
- How are you?
- I... Well, rested now.
- Thank you.
- I'm glad.
Would you like some espresso?
I would love some. Thank you very much.
This looks amazing.
I didn't take your seat, did I?
No, no, no. It's okay. Please.
Did you...
Did you recover from your trip?
I did. Yeah, big time.
- Thank you.
- Good.
I could show you around.
That'd be great. Thank you.
Is there a... Is there a bank in town?
I'd love to start
an account while I'm here.
Let me do it.
Sorry.
- It happens to the best of us.
- Yeah, well...
None of our residents has ever
had a local bank account.
Really?
Should I take him to Montodine?
I think they're closed
for summer vacation.
You try Crema.
Crema?
Thank you.
Is this your orchard?
These are Annella's trees.
Peaches, cherries, apricots...
Pomegranate.
Have another egg.
Oh, stupid.
No, no, no. I know myself too well.
If I have a second,
I'm just gonna have a third,
and then a fourth, and then you're just
gonna have to roll me out of here.
- Delicious.
- Darling?
Thank you.
Shall I give him Anchise's bike?
So, what does one do around here?
Wait for the summer to end.
Yeah?
What do you do in the winter?
- Wait for summer to come?
- Well, we only come here for Christmas
and some other vacations.
- Christmas? I thought you...
- And Easter as well.
- Thought you were Jewish.
- Well, we are Jewish,
but also American, Italian, French.
Somewhat atypical combination.
Besides my family, you're probably
the only other Jew
to set foot in this town.
I'm from a small town in New England.
I know what it's like
to be the odd Jew out.
So, what do you do around here?
Just read books.
Transcribe music. Swim at the river.
- Yeah?
- Go out at night.
- I don't know.
- That sounds fun.
All right, buddy, thanks for the help.
Sorry. Sorry about that.
It's all right.
All right, later.
What do you have there?
That should all be...
What is this?
These are the continuation
of these archaeology department...
These are archaeology?
Yeah, those are archaeology.
The rest of these should be history.
Okay.
- More apricot juice?
- Yeah.
- Here, tesoro.
- Thank you.
Help yourself, darling.
Thanks.
Help yourself to some more.
The word "apricot"
comes from the Arabic.
It's like the words "algebra,"
"alchemy," "alcohol."
It derives from an Arabic noun
combined with the Arabic article "al"
before it.
The origin of our Italian albicocca
is al-barquq.
It's amazing that today in Israel
and many Arab countries,
the fruit's referred to
by a totally different name, mismish.
I may have to disagree
with you there, Professor.
I'm gonna talk etymology,
so just bear with me a second.
You're right in the case
that most Latin words
do find their origins in Greek words.
However, in the case of "apricot,"
it's a little bit more
of a complicated journey.
How so?
Well, here, the Greek actually
takes over from the Latin.
Latin word being
praecoquum or precoquere.
So it's, "precook" or "pre-ripen,"
as you know.
To be precocious or premature.
And the Byzantines, to go on,
then borrowed praecox,
which became prekokkia,
which then became berikokki,
which is how the Arabs got al-barquq.
That's courtesy of Philology 101.
Flying colors.
He does this every year.
It's about drink time. Let's go here.
- Ciao, Romano.
- Ciao, Oliver.
- How are you?
- All good.
Ciao, boys!
All good?
All good!
Let's see. What have we got?
- Can you start please?
- Of course!
Good morning, gentlemen.
How do you know about this place?
Okay.
Go, Chiara!
No, no, no, no, no!
He's better than the guy
who came last year.
Remember?
Get in there!
Much better!
See how cute he is.
Elio, water!
Perfect timing.
What's the matter? Are you all right?
- What, pinch a nerve?
- I'm okay.
Here. Hold this.
Trust me. I'm about to be a doctor.
Hey, hey, come here.
See? That's the problem.
You're too stressed.
- You just gotta relax a little bit.
- I am relaxing.
Marzia, come here for a minute.
Back me up here.
- Feel that. Right there?
- Oliver.
- It's too tight, right?
- Yeah.
- He needs to relax.
- Oliver!
Later.
You should relax more.
Okay, guys, ready?
Okay, our ball, our ball, our ball.
Twelve serving 11.
Mine, mine, mine, mine.
Go, go, go. Yeah, good.
It's yours, it's yours.
Sweetheart, Auntie Marcella and
the others are coming over for dinner.
Is Oliver staying with us or going out?
Don't know.
What a movie star!
Yes, those Americans...
Sparkling wine!
He's late.
Don't you think...
Don't you think he's impolite
when he says, "Later"?
Arrogant.
I don't think he's arrogant.
Just watch.
This is how he'll say good-bye
to us when the time comes.
With his... "Later."
Meanwhile, we'll have to put up with him
for six long weeks.
Won't we, darling?
I think he's shy.
You'll grow to like him.
What if I grow to hate him?
Oh, no, sweetheart.
- Take his plates away.
- Very well, madam.
Darling?
Elio, play something.
I don't want to.
Why not?
Because I don't want to.
Why don't you go
to Moscazzano with others?
Because I don't want to.
You're spoiling everyone's fun.
Play well, darling.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing?
Reading.
How come you're not with everyone else
down by the river?
- I have an allergy. It's...
- Yeah, me too.
Maybe we have the same one.
Why don't you and I go swimming?
- Right now?
- Yeah.
Come on. Let's go.
Do we have to go right now?
- I'll go get changed.
- Okay.
Meet you downstairs.
See you downstairs.
Elio, what are you doing?
Reading my music.
No, you're not.
- Thinking, then.
- Yeah?
About what?
It's private.
You're not gonna tell me?
I'm not gonna tell you.
He's not gonna tell me
what he's thinking about.
Elio.
I guess I'll go hang out with your mom.
More apricot juice, please.
That's a good boy.
Thank God you're helping me.
Sounds nice.
Thought you didn't like it.
Play it again, will you?
Follow me.
That sounds different.
Did you change it?
- Well, I changed it a little bit.
- Why?
I just played it the way Liszt
would have played it
if he'd altered Bach's version.
Play that again.
- Play what again?
- The thing you played outside.
You want me to play
the thing I played outside?
- Please.
- Of course.
I can't believe you changed it again.
- I changed it a little bit.
- Yeah. Why?
I just played it the way
Busoni would've played it
if he'd altered Liszt's version.
And what is wrong with Bach
the way Bach would've played...
Bach never wrote it for the guitar.
In fact, we're not even sure.
- Bach wrote it at all.
- Forget I asked.
It's young Bach.
He dedicated it to his brother.
Hey, Professor.
Hello.
Here, please.
I need help.
Just be honest.
How bad is it?
I think your insights here
are persuasive, but...
Have you been to the river?
Mafalda!
Isn't she beautiful?
Elio.
You sleeping?
I was.
Listen to this drivel.
Tell me what you think.
- Wait.
- What?
Can't hear you.
"For the early Greeks,
"Heidegger contends,
this underlying hiddenness
"is constitutive of the way beings are,
"not only in relation to themselves
"but also in relation
to other entities generally.
"In other words,
they do not construe hiddenness
"merely or primarily in terms of
entities' relations to human beings."
Does that make any sense to you?
Doesn't make any sense to me.
I don't think it makes
any sense to your dad, either.
Maybe it did when you wrote it.
That might be the kindest thing
anybody has said to me in months.
"Kind"?
Yep. Kind.
- Hey, Elio.
- Hey.
Hey!
Come here.
What's going on?
Is he trying to get it on with her?
Elio, he already succeeded?
What do I know?
I'd love to be in his shoes.
Who wouldn't love to be in her shoes?
She wants him, no matter what!
Coming?
I'll come later.
Are you with me because
you're mad at Chiara?
Why would I be mad at Chiara?
Because of him.
Because of who?
Of Oliver.
Turn around.
Meet me here tomorrow night?
Wait for me!
Come on.
We almost had sex last night...
Marzia and me.
Well, why didn't you?
I don't know.
Well, you know, it's better
to have tried and failed, right?
All I had to do was find the courage
to reach out and touch.
She would have said yes.
Well, try again later.
Try what later?
I just heard
from the people in Sirmione.
They say they've come up with something.
Fantastic.
Going there today.
- Would you like to come along?
- I would love to. Thank you.
- Smell this.
- Can I come, too?
On the condition you remain silent.
Silent as in,
"He has too many opinions,"
or silent as in,
"Just not telling anybody
"what an amazing thing you've dug up"?
Well, nothing has been dug up.
It's what has been brought out,
out of the water.
What are you doing?
Going to Lake Garda with my dad.
He wants to show Oliver
where he's dredging.
Can you tell him I came by?
He's inside with my dad, helping him.
You were amazing last night,
on the dance floor.
- He's a good dancer.
- A good dancer.
He's good-looking too.
- Want to get us together?
- No.
Come in.
Dad always sits up front
with Anchise to navigate.
She seems to like you a lot.
She's more beautiful
than she was last year.
I saw her naked on a night swim once.
Great body.
Trying to get me to like her?
What would be the harm in that?
No, no harm.
Just typically like to go at those
things on my own, if you don't mind.
I'll drive today!
Just don't play at being the good host.
Anchise, take the afternoon off.
What's going on, boys?
Oliver, come. Sit up front.
Be my navigator.
What? What?
- Dr. Roseburg.
- Samuel!
- Benvenuto.
- Look who's here.
- He's grown a bit, eh?
- And this is Oliver.
Sammy! Come on!
Truce?
Hey, boys.
The ship went down in 1on the way to Isola del Garda.
Gossip has it this statue
was a gift from Count Lechi
to his lover,
contralto Adelaide Malanotte.
There are four known sets,
after the Praxiteles originals.
This fellow's at number three.
The Emperor Hadrian had a pair,
dug up at Tivoli,
but one of the more philistine
of the Farnese Popes melted them down
and had them recast as a
particularly voluptuous Venus.
Who'd like to go for a swim
before we head back?
We're all such pros. If I got my own
statue, it would probably be on there.
Elio!
Oliver!
- I have to go. I have to go.
- Hey! Hey!
I have to go.
Goodness.
- Are you going, too?
- No, no.
I should stay
and do some work on my book.
Come on. How about a drink
to celebrate the day?
- Okay, maybe just one.
- All right!
Marzia?
The Cosmic Fragments by Heraclitus.
The meaning of the river flowing
is not that all things are changing
so that we cannot encounter them twice,
but that some things
stay the same only by changing.
Sorry, Elio.
I brought some clean clothes.
Leave the door open.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Darling, have you seen my HeptamÃ©ron?
Mafalda.
It's in German.
Okay.
I can't remember where we left off,
but I think you'll like this one.
Come here, darling.
So, I'll translate, huh?
"A handsome young knight
is madly in love with a princess.
"And she, too, is in love with him,
"though she seems not to be
entirely aware of it.
"Despite the friendship..."
"...that blossoms between them,
"or perhaps because of
that very friendship,
"the young knight finds himself so..."
"...so humbled and speechless
"that he's totally unable to bring up
the subject of his love.
"Till one day, he asks the princess
point-blank..."
"Is it better to speak or to die?"
I'd never have the courage
to ask a question like that.
I doubt that.
Hey, Elly-Belly.
You do know that
you can always talk to us.
My mom's been reading
this 16th-century French romance.
She read some of it to my dad and I
the day the lights went out.
Yeah, about the knight that doesn't know
whether to speak or die?
Right.
So, does he or doesn't he?
"Better to speak," she said.
But she's on her guard.
She senses a trap somewhere.
So, does he speak?
No.
He fudges.
It figures. He's French.
I gotta go to town in a little bit
to pick some things up.
I can go. I'm not doing anything today.
Then why don't we go together?
Right now?
Yeah. Right now.
That is, of course, unless you have
more important business going on.
"That is, of course, unless you have
more important business going on."
Mind if I put this in your bag?
Yes, please.
I straightened the wheels
and inflated the tires.
Perfect. Thanks.
I fell. I was coming home the other day,
and I scraped myself pretty badly.
Anchise insisted on applying
some sort of witches' brew.
I think it helped.
Hold this for a second, will you?
- Want one?
- Sure.
Not bad, huh?
Not bad at all.
I thought you didn't smoke.
I don't.
- So, World War II, huh?
- No. This is World War I.
You'd have to be at least 80 years old
to have known any of them.
I never even heard
of the Battle of Piave.
Battle of Piave was one of the most
lethal battles of World War I.
Hundred and seventy thousand
people died.
Is there anything you don't know?
I know nothing, Oliver.
Well, you seem to know
more than anybody else around here.
Well, if you only knew how little
I know about the things that matter.
What things that matter?
You know what things.
Why are you telling me this?
'Cause I thought you should know.
Because you thought I should know?
'Cause I wanted you to know?
Because I wanted you to know.
Because I wanted you to know.
'Cause I wanted you to know.
Because there's no one else
I can say this to but you.
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?
Don't go anywhere. Stay right here.
You know I'm not going anywhere.
They mixed up all of my pages.
I'm gonna have to
retype this whole thing.
I'm not gonna have anything to work on
this afternoon.
This is gonna set me back a whole day.
Damn it.
Shouldn't have said anything.
Just pretend you never did.
Does that mean we're on speaking terms
but not really?
It means we can't talk
about those kinds of things.
Okay?
We just can't.
Hey.
Let's go, American!
- Ready?
- Let's go.
Pretty much.
Oh, my God.
- Thirsty?
- Yeah.
Good morning, ma'am.
Excuse me.
Could I ask for a glass of water?
I'll Duce.
"People of Italy!"
That's Italy.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Come on!
This is my spot. It's all mine.
Come here to read.
Can't tell you the number of books
I've read here.
Oh, my God, it's freezing.
Spring is in the mountains.
The Alpi Orobie.
The water comes
straight down from there.
I like the way you say things.
I don't know why you're always
putting yourself down, though.
So you won't, I guess.
You really that afraid of what I think?
You're making things
very difficult for me.
I love this, Oliver.
What?
Everything.
Us, you mean?
It's not bad.
It's not bad.
Better now?
No, no, no.
- We should go.
- Why?
I know myself. Okay?
And we've been good.
We haven't done anything
to be ashamed of,
and that's a good thing.
I wanna be good.
Okay?
Am I offending you?
Just don't.
I think it's starting to get infected.
We can stop by the pharmacist's
on the way back.
Excellent idea.
So we got the government
of Bettino Craxi...
Because we don't do anything
but talk, talk, talk.
Let me speak.
We have five parties
that do nothing but fight.
Smoke and shut up!
Let them speak, him, her.
I'd like to know what they think too.
Annella, what do you think?
A five party government!
Darling, I think
it's the historic compromise...
Don't say that. Compromises are tragic.
You've changed
since you inherited this place.
What's that got to do with it?
What are you saying?
You're mad, darling.
You asshole!
- She's right.
- And you don't say anything to her.
Say something.
You're resigned.
Why don't we talk
about the death of BuÃ±uel?
BuÃ±uel was a genius.
- Know him?
- Cinema isn't the answer.
Cinema is a mirror of reality
and it's a filter.
They broadcast The Phantom of Liberty
with constant interr...
Everyone loves BuÃ±uel!
Let's hear his opinion.
He doesn't know anything about Italy!
Say something. Give us your impression.
Do you have an impression?
Darling, he's American.
That doesn't mean stupid!
Just stop.
I don't give an easy ride
to some politicians.
She didn't say that.
I'm going to go mad.
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
It's nothing. It happens all the time.
- Mafalda, ice?
- It's in the fridge.
You get used to absolutely everything.
Don't you realize
you're mixing everything up?
What are you talking about?
There's no more politics, nothing.
He's left too.
Elio?
Elio.
You all right?
Sit for a second.
If you insist.
- That wasn't my fault, right?
- No.
I'm a mess.
Well, the kitchen table sure is.
Where did you learn to do that?
My bubbe used to do this for us
when we were sick.
Trust me, it helps.
I used to have one of these.
- You used to?
- Yeah.
How come you never wear it?
My mother says
we are Jews of discretion.
Well...
I guess that works for your mother.
Funny witch.
Fuck, you'll kill me if you do that.
I hope not.
Hey, are you leaving?
- Where's Elio?
- He's inside.
He had a bit of a nosebleed
during lunch, and he's just resting.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Okay. Bye.
- I'll be back in a minute.
Don't go anywhere.
You okay?
Are we going out?
I don't know if I can go out.
If my mom sees, she'll worry.
- She will?
- Yeah, she's a pain.
Where's Oliver?
Don't ask me.
Where's Oliver?
- Didn't he go out?
- Would you like a smoothie?
No, thank you. We're having dinner soon.
All right.
I'm going out tonight.
- Don't make me worry.
- What are you talking about?
This is no good, madam.
- Let him do his own thing.
- Fine.
Why's she hassling me? I'm 17.
She's worried about you.
You like him, don't you? Oliver?
Everyone likes Oliver.
I think he likes you too.
More than you do.
Is that your impression?
- No, he told me.
- When did he say that?
A while ago.
Mafalda, do you know where Oliver is?
I have no idea.
Traitor.
Traitor.
This is Craxi.
I draw the center of Craxi...
- Hey.
- Hi!
It's me. Is that Marzia?
Sure it is! Can't you tell?
Sorry.
Is that for me?
Thanks.
Do you really read a lot?
I love reading too,
but I don't tell anyone.
Why not?
I don't know.
I think...
people who read are...
kind of secretive.
They hide who they really are.
Do you hide who you really are?
No, not with you.
Not with me?
Well, maybe a bit.
What do you mean?
You know exactly what I mean.
Why do you say that?
Why?
Because...
I think...
you're going to hurt me,
and I don't want to be hurt.
You're so hard.
Wait.
Kiss me.
- Is that good?
- Yes.
Are you lying?
- Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
Are you mad at me? Are you angry?
What's so funny? Why are you laughing?
Leave me alone.
Fuck, that felt good.
Please don't avoid me.
It kills me.
Can't stand thinking you hate me.
Your silence is killing me.
I'd sooner die than know you hate me.
I am such a pussy.
Way over the top.
Can't stand the silence.
Need to speak to you.
Did someone have a good night
last night?
Not really.
Well, you must be tired, then.
Or were you playing poker, too?
I don't play poker.
Several hundred color slides
of our boxer and the others like him
arrived yesterday from Berlin.
We should start cataloging them.
That'll keep us busy till lunch,
I imagine.
Sure.
Beautiful, aren't they?
They're all so incredibly sensual.
Because these are more Hellenistic
than 5th century Athenian.
Most likely sculpted
under the influence of Praxiteles.
Right.
Greatest sculptor in antiquity.
Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.
Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.
Muscles are firm.
Look at his stomach, for example.
Not a straight body in these statues.
They're all curved.
Sometimes impossibly curved.
And so nonchalant.
Hence their ageless ambiguity.
As if they're daring you to desire them.
Don't forget, Isaac and Mounir
are coming for dinner.
- Also known as Sonny and Cher.
- Okay.
I'd like you to wear that shirt
they gave you for your birthday.
No.
- Darling, they got it for you in Miami.
- I'm sorry. It's too big. It's too big.
- Come on. It will make them so happy.
- It looks ridiculous on me.
I'll try it on for Oliver.
If Oliver thinks
I look like a scarecrow in it,
I'm not wearing it.
Oliver?
Hey, what time you got?
It's 2:00.
- Well... Later.
- Later.
Mafalda.
I won't be here for dinner.
Okay, Mr. Oliver.
Hello, Mafalda.
Marzia.
Where are we going?
You'll see.
Stop it!
- How are you, buddy?
- Hey!
- It's been ages.
- It has, yes.
- How are you?
- You've grown.
- How are you.
- I'm good.
Good to see you.
Remember Marzia from last year.
Hello.
- Marzia, remember Isaac?
- The girl from Paris?
Good to meet you.
Want to eat with us tonight?
No, no. I have to go.
- You're sure?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Have a nice evening.
Goodbye.
This right here is the brand-new china
that you guys so kindly sent to us.
It looks wonderful.
Come here, Mounir, Mounir.
- Come, come, come.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I can't put it on now.
They've already met me.
- Yes, you can.
- It'll look like a put-up job.
- Papa, it'll...
- Yes.
- Papa, it'll look like a put-up job.
- No misbehaving tonight.
No... No laughing.
When I tell you to play, you'll play.
You're too old not to accept
people for who they are.
What's wrong with them?
What's wrong with them?
You call them Sonny and Cher
behind their backs.
- That's what Mom calls them...
- Then you accept gifts from them.
The only person that reflects badly on
is you.
Is it because they're gay
or because they're ridiculous?
If you know as much about economics
at Mounir's age,
you'll be a very wise man, indeed.
And a credit to me.
Now, just get into this, you.
These are unbelievable. I just...
Hey, look who's here.
Sorry. I have to go to bed.
I'm sorry. I'm so tired.
Thank you.
Elio. Elio.
- Thank you.
- Good night.
Good night.
Do I know you?
Thank you again for everything.
- They're never gonna make it.
- No, no. They're fine.
I'm glad you came.
Yeah, I'm nervous.
I like what you've done with the place.
It's nice.
You okay?
Me okay.
- Can I kiss you?
- Yes, please.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Does this make you happy?
You're not gonna get
a nosebleed on me, are you?
I'm not gonna get...
Off, off, off, off, off.
Yeah. Just pull it.
Or I'll pull it.
Oliver.
Call me by your name,
and I'll call you by mine.
Elio.
Oliver.
Elio.
- Oliver.
- Elio.
Did we make noise?
Nothing to worry about.
I don't know.
Mafalda always looks for signs.
Well, she's not gonna find any.
You wore that shirt
the first day you were here.
Will you give it to me when you go?
Let's go swimming.
Are you gonna hold
what happened last night against me?
No.
Elio. Come here.
Take your trunks off.
Well, that's promising.
You're hard again.
Good.
Professor, I got your note.
Thank you for reminding me.
I'm gonna go into town and pick
up those typed pages today,
so maybe this afternoon
would be a good time to...
Later.
We'll look them over later,
before you leave.
Okay. So later.
Later.
Oliver.
You're not sick of me yet?
No, I just...
I just wanted to be with you.
I'll... I'm gonna... I'll go.
Do you know how happy I am
that we slept together?
I don't know.
Of course, you don't know.
I don't want you to regret anything.
And I hate the thought that maybe
I may have messed you up or...
I don't want either of us
to pay for this,
- one way or another.
- No, I...
It's not like
I'm gonna tell anyone.
You're not gonna be, like,
getting in trouble.
That's not what I'm talking about.
Are you happy I came here?
I would kiss you if I could.
Times change.
Thank God we had the partisans.
I know, but times have changed.
It's different.
What do you think of Bettino?
- I don't like him.
- I like him.
I'm happy, actually.
I don't know. We'll see.
Anyway, they make the rules.
Pasquina!
Hello.
Hello, ma'am.
- Tortelli cremaschi.
- Yes.
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
What did you do?
- Nothing.
- No?
Oh, I see.
You've moved on
to the plant kingdom already.
What's next? Minerals?
I suppose you've already
given up animals.
You know that's me.
I'm sick, aren't I?
I wish everybody was as sick as you.
Please don't do that.
- You want to see something sick?
- Please don't do that.
You want to see something sick?
Please don't do this.
Hey. Please don't do it.
Why are you doing this to me?
- What are you doing?
- Stop.
- You're fucking hurting me.
- Then don't fight.
Sorry.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I don't want you to go.
God, we wasted so many days.
Why didn't you give me a sign?
- I did. I did.
- You didn't give me a sign.
When?
You remember
when we were playing volleyball
and I touched you?
Just to show you that I liked you?
And the way you reacted
made me feel like I'd molested you.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.
I just decided
I should keep my distance.
I don't know.
I come out here for hours
almost every night.
I didn't know that.
That's funny, I...
I thought that...
Yeah, I know what you thought.
Stop. Stop.
"For Oliver.
"From Elio."
Elio?
You disappeared for three days.
I had to work.
You completely disappeared.
Yeah, I don't know. I just...
I had a lot to do.
Am I your girl?
Oliver has to go to Bergamo
for a few days.
Research at the university.
Then he'll fly home from Linate.
But what about Elio?
Maybe it could be nice
for the two of them
to get away for a couple of days, no?
What do you think?
You know you've been
our favorite student?
- You must come back.
- You sure you're not just saying that?
- Oliver.
- Thank you very much, Professor.
Oh, man.
Please, please come back soon.
Come back? I'm just going home to pack.
I'm moving here.
You're welcome.
Oh, well...
- Thank you guys so much.
- Of course.
Oliver, Oliver.
- Come back.
- It's been...
Come here, come here.
It's been amazing. Thank you guys.
Well, later, Perlmans.
Later. Later, later, later.
Tell Elio to call when you get there.
Oh, no.
Come for dinner tonight.
Bring Marzia.
Bye, darling.
- What?
- Nothing.
- What?
- Nothing.
Oh, to see without my eyes.
The first time that you kissed me.
Boundless by the time I cried.
I built your walls around me.
Yes!
White noise
What an awful sound
Oliver!
Elio!
Elio!
Hand of God, deliver me.
Oh, woe is me.
The first time that you touched me.
- Oliver!
- Elio!
Oh, will wonders never cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love.
Lord, I no longer believe.
Yes!
Drowned in living waters.
Cursed by the love that I received.
From my brother's daughter.
Like Hephaestion who died.
Alexander's lover.
Now I'm prone to misery.
The birthmark on your...
Oh, God.
And I'm feeling low.
Understand I'm feeling low.
You hear that?
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, it's this way.
Come on. Come on. You're missing it.
Come on.
Don't stop.
A kiss is not enough...
This. This.
This. You.
You are...
Love my way.
It's a new road.
I follow...
If you'll excuse me...
Just one second.
One second!
They'd dearly make us pay.
For laughing in their faces.
And making it our way.
There's emptiness behind their eyes.
There's dust in all their hearts
I saw them last year.
Richard Butler... fantastic!
Really? We saw them in concert too.
We hitchhiked to London.
What'd she say?
It's a new road
I follow.
Where my mind goes.
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
Did you get your passport?
You get your passport?
Mafalda?
Mom?
Yeah, it's me.
Yeah, everything is fine.
I'm at the station...
in Clusone.
Listen, Mom, can you...
Can you come get me, Mom?
How are you?
Good.
I read the book you bought me.
The poems...
They're really beautiful.
I love that... Antonia Pozzi.
I'm sorry, excuse me...
that you're sad.
I'm saying that because
I wanted to tell you
I'm not mad at you.
Not at all.
I love you, Elio.
Stay friends?
For life?
For life?
Missed you at dinner.
So...
Welcome home.
Thanks.
- Oliver enjoyed the trip?
- Yeah.
I think he did.
You two had a nice friendship.
Yeah.
You're too smart not to know how rare,
how special what you two had was.
Oliver was Oliver.
Because it was him.
Because it was me.
Oliver may be very intelligent but...
He was more than intelligent.
What you two had,
had everything and nothing
to do with intelligence.
He was good.
You're both lucky
to have found each other
because you, too, are good...
I think he was better than...
I think he was better than me.
I'm sure he'd say
the same thing about you.
Yeah. He'd say the same thing.
It flatters you both.
And when you least expect it,
nature has cunning ways
of finding our weakest spot.
Just remember, I am here.
Right now,
you may not wanna feel anything,
maybe you never wanted to feel anything.
And maybe it's not to me
you'd want to speak about this things
but feel something you obviously did.
Look, you had a beautiful friendship.
Maybe more than a friendship.
And I envy you.
In my place, most parents would hope
the whole thing goes away.
Pray their sons land on their feet,
but I am not such a parent.
We rip out so much of ourselves
to be cured of things faster,
that we go bankrupt by the age of 30.
And have less to offer,
each time we start with someone new.
But to make yourself feel nothing
so as not to feel anything.
What a waste.
Have I spoken out of turn?
And I'll say one more thing,
it'll clear the air.
I may have come close
but I never had what you two have.
Something always held me back
or stood in the way.
How you live your life is your business.
Just remember,
our hearts and our bodies
are given to us only once,
and before you know it,
your heart's worn out.
And as for your body,
there comes a point
when no one looks at it
much less wants to come near it.
Right now, there's sorrow, pain.
Don't kill it,
and with it, the joy you felt.
Does Mom know?
I don't think she does.
- Have you been to the Gaverine?
- Yes.
Latkes.
- May I?
- Happy Hanukkah!
To you too.
She looks a bit weak.
She comes highly recommended by...
Her special area of study is...
I'll get it.
Hello?
Elio, you there?
- Hi.
- Hey.
- How are you.
- I'm good.
I'm good. How are you?
- How are your parents?
- I'm good. They're fine.
Good.
I miss you.
I miss you too.
Very much.
- I have some news.
- News?
What, you're getting married?
I suppose.
I might be getting married
next spring, yeah.
You never said anything.
Been off and on for three years.
That's wonderful news.
Do you mind?
- Oliver.
- Oliver.
- Oliver.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Darling, when are you coming back?
I wish I was.
You caught us in the process of choosing
the new you for next summer.
- And guess what? He's a she.
- Oh, no.
Speaking of she's, I'm calling
to tell you guys I got engaged.
Wonderful!
- Congratulations.
- Mazel tov!
- Congratulations, Oliver.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Listen, we'll leave you...
We'll let you speak to Elio.
- Happy Hanukkah!
- Happy Hanukkah!
Bye, sweetheart.
They know about us.
I figured.
How?
Well, from the way your dad spoke to me.
He made me feel
like I was a part of the family.
Almost like a son-in-law.
You're so lucky.
My father would have carted me off
to a correctional facility.
Elio.
Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.
Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.
Oliver.
I remember everything.
Elio.
Elio.
$&$Christopher and his kind$&$
This programme contains
very strong language
This programme contains scenes
of a sexual nature
It's 40 years since I first wrote
about my time in Berlin,
and the book I'm now writing is
perhaps an attempt to set the
record as straight as possible.
I destroyed my Berlin diaries,
you see, so have had to rely
a good deal on memory.
As to why I went in the first place,
my friend Wystan Auden was there
and encouraged me to join him.
I could also say I went because
of what was happening politically.
But, in fact, I went
because of the boys.
To me, Berlin meant boys.
Danke schon, mein Liebling.
One man has hands that are tender
One man has hands that are strong
If I should choose to surrender
My choices are bound to be wrong
I might find my ideal lover
If I search both far and wide... #
But, my dear, that simply won't do.
You're the very last
person who ought to go there.
Berlin isn't the right
place for you at all.
What on Earth do you mean?
It's German, darling.
Wystan Auden thinks it's
the most marvellous place.
Auden! Such an untidy boy!
And, besides, what
about medical school?
But, Mummy, I am not
cut out for medical school.
That's exactly what you
said about Cambridge!
Really, Christopher, you cannot
go through life shirking it.
It's time you buckled to.
I'm a published novelist!
Of course you are, darling,
but wouldn't it be so much
nicer to be a doctor, as well?
It isn't a hobby, you know?
Any normal mother would be proud.
And I am proud, my sweetheart.
You know I found your
novel most interesting.
I thought it was ingenious the way
you used your antipathy towards me
to such creative effect.
But you cannot expect life
to be one long holiday.
I'm not going there on holiday,
I'm going there to get away from you.
Couldn't you go somewhere a little
closer, like the Isle of Wight?
Mother!
I don't know to whom I belong
It would be such
a shame to end up on my own
If I make myself true to one
How another will surely be sad
and alone
Of course, you must do as you wish.
I fully intend to.
It's only natural, I suppose, that
you should want to flee the nest,
just as I am bound
to get more lonely.
When I think of what I went through
to bring you into this world!
Months and months of
feeling really quite seedy.
Oh well, so be it.
You won't forget, will you, darling,
that the Germans killed your father?
MACHINE GUNS
Take me with you.
You have to stay
and look after Mummy.
But for how long?
I'm afraid I can't answer that.
If I make myself true to one
How another
will surely be sad and alone
Should such a beauty
belong to one person?
No, surely, the sun
and the stars
They belong to us all
I don't know
To whom I belong
I believe
I only belong to myself. #
APPLAUSE
Danke. Vielen Dank.
I was wondering...
Oh, do forgive me, dear boy.
I didn't mean to startle you.
No, no.
Could I trouble you for a light?
Yes, of course.
I seem to have mislaid my
lighter, I suspect it...
Thank you, dear boy.
It may have been...
Would you mind if I...?
No, no. How kind!
It may have been stolen. Oh dear.
One has to be so careful
nowadays, don't you find?
Are you going all the way?
Excuse me? To Berlin?
Yes.
Holiday? I'm hoping for
a little more than that.
Ah, yes.
Well, Berlin has so much to
offer, in certain respects.
Do you live there? For now.
One never knows what
a new dawn may bring.
I hope you don't think I'm prying,
dear boy, but do you have
accommodation in Berlin?
I do, as it happens, yes.
The reason why I venture such
impertinence is that my landlady,
dear, sweet woman,
is desperate for a reliable lodger.
Her landlords are ruthless
and if they knew she didn't
have the full quota,
well, turf her out in an instant.
I have a feeling, and though
perhaps I shouldn't say so myself,
I do have a nose for these things.
You might fit the bill perfectly.
My goodness, yes. Well, that's
most kind of you, but as I say...
I'll tell her, then, shall I?
Here's my card. Mr Hamilton.
Oh, Gerald, please.
And who shall I tell her to expect?
Isherwood.
Christopher Isherwood.
ANNOUNCEMENT ON TANNOY
Wystan!
So, here I am! Yes, here you are.
Good trip?
Fine, thanks.
Those seats are devilish.
I hardly noticed.
I thought we'd drop your case off,
then I'd show you the sights.
Best start as one means to go on.
I decided the Brandenburg Gate
could wait.
Don't worry, they won't bite,
unless you want them to.
They're very accommodating if you
have the cash, but it won't break
the bank, the exchange rate is
still very much in our favour.
Ah, Pieps! Hallo.
IN GERMAN
Guten Abend. Guten Abend. Niedlich!
What are you saying?
What was that?
We've been something of a feature.
Well, maybe more of a B feature.
I have no illusions of the
pitfalls of loving a whore.
Are they all on the game?
Most of them, yes. You can't imagine
what a state the economy's in.
They look very well on it.
Yeah, they like to
keep themselves fit.
It's good for business, of course,
and they're shamelessly vain.
The fact that we find them
desirable only proves how
very masculine they are.
What do you mean, "we"?
They're nearly all rampant heters
and use our money to pay for cunt.
But don't let that put you off,
they're frightfully good at it.
What name does he go under?
Caspar.
That's about the only
thing I understood.
Perhaps you'd better help me
trot out the odd German phrase,
else I could get myself
into the most frightful fix.
Perhaps I better had.
The question is, will you
understand the answers?
I might have found somewhere to stay.
Oh, yes? I got talking to this
man on the train. You little slut!
apparently his landlady's
rather desperate for a lodger.
Something about filling her quota.
Anyway, I thought there'd be
no harm in checking it out.
You're very welcome
to stay here, you know.
In fact I'd
very much like it if you did.
I need a room of my own, Wystan.
Once I start giving
lessons, which I'm going
to have to earn a bit of cash
and subsidise my writing, well...
And you can't write
poetry with me buzzing about.
Yes, you're right.
So, I expect you'll be seeing
him again, this Caspar chappie?
Well, yes. I hope so.
I have missed you.
I love English
gentlemen, Herr Issyvoo.
Herr Hamilton, such a charming man!
And you, a writer! What an honour!
You can
write many famous novels here.
Oh, Herr Issyvoo,
this room was made for you!
It's very nice, Fraulein Thurau.
Oh, Herr Issyvoo!
You English are so polite.
Well, you English men.
There is an English
woman across the hall.
She treats me like a slave.
"Fraulein Ross,"
I tell her, "I was a lady. I have
not always scrubbed the floors."
Ach, forgive me, Herr Issyvoo,
that was the lodger before you.
I don't know what he'd eaten
but it won't come out.
THEY SPEAK GERMAN
Morning, darling. I have
the most perfectly frightful head.
Who is it? Isherwood.
Who? Christopher Isherwood.
It's me, Christopher.
We met on the train.
I've taken the room.
Oh, Christopher!
Do forgive me, dear boy,
one has to be so careful nowadays.
Since my release from Brixton
I've rather lost touch with
the old country.
You were in prison? Yes, for
expressing anti-British sentiments,
though how, I ask myself,
could I be regarded as a traitor
when I have rivers of Irish blood
simply coursing through my veins?
So you're in business here?
One must have
fingers in many pies, dear boy.
Such alarming times we live in.
Ah! Heinrich! A young stevedore
I encountered in Hamburg.
And what were you doing in Hamburg?
What is one ever doing anywhere?
Passing through, dear boy.
That is our destiny,
forever passing through.
He does make rather an impression,
though, doesn't he? Well, I...
I have found, Christopher,
down the years, that I have
never been able to relax sexually
with a member of my own class.
That an affair with one's social and
intellectual equal is
well nigh impossible, mm?
I suppose.
You are in the right city, dear boy.
Quite the place to let your hair
down with some eager young prole.
Oh, dear, is it crooked?
Just a tiny bit, perhaps. Of course,
one must take a little care.
We're still illegal,
and should the Nazis come to power
they'll stamp us out altogether.
What's the current Communist line?
Well, as far as I know, Lenin
said nothing about buggery.
Dearest Heinrich!
Smelt exactly like a fox.
Delicious!
Haven't you gone yet, Ludo?
Oh, do put something on!
You'll frighten the horses.
He's Polish.
"He noticed I was staring at his
wig and asked if it was crooked.
"'Just a little', I said,
and he straightened it."
You like, ja? Ja. Spot on.
GASPING
Window. Good.
Good. Ah.
And this?
Fish. No, what is it?
Big fish?
No, this. What is this?
Whale.
No. It's a clock.
Clock! Ja!
Yes, good. And that's a dolphin.
Was? Never mind.
That...Fraulein Schmidt?
Well, what is that?
SHE LAUGHS
GASPING AND MOANING
Oh, Christoph! Oh!
This is how I'd like to die.
Ist gut? Ja? Ja, ja!
Guten Morgen, Herr Hamilton!
Oh, Guten Morgen, Fraulein Mayr.
Guten Morgen.
Danke.
ROARING BEHIND DOOR
Guten Morgen, Herr Issyvoo.
Guten Morgen, Fraulein Thurau.
How sweet love must be!
Tonight, yes?
Jawohl.
Morning, darling.
Of course I don't know half the
people who pass through this place,
but you've been here simply
generations.
I thought we really must say hello.
Would you like coffee or tea?
Well... I don't recommend the tea
much.
I don't know what Fraulein
Thurau does to it,
but it tastes just like slops.
Tell me, Chris, what do you do?
People tend not to call me Chris. I'm
an actress. Not at the moment.
I'm singing in a night club. But
you absolutely must come and see me.
What about tonight? I'm afraid
tonight's rather difficult.
Was that your boyfriend in
the hall or just a one off?
I find one offs so much less
of a hassle, don't you, darling?
I've been here for centuries,
getting on three months now.
I came here with a girlfriend who
assured me we'd get film work,
but then she was whisked off
to Paris by a fat banker and
left me utterly stranded.
How rotten. Oh, I don't care.
I can stand on my own two feet.
But don't you mind being here alone?
One's always alone, duckie.
Surely you know that.
How old are you?
I'm practically antique.
I'm nearly 21.
I'm frightfully bright, you know.
I got myself expelled from
school by saying I was pregnant.
There was the most terrible to
do when they found out I wasn't.
I got myself sent down
from Cambridge. I say!
Flunked my Tripos.
What a hoot!
I'm meeting a man in
The Adlon for lunch,
but he'll have to wait.
He has the most revolting
underpants, they're
like camel hair or something.
It's the sort of thing
John The Baptist might wear.
Oh, Mummy would nearly die
if she knew what an old whore I am,
but one has to keep that horrid
wolf from the door, doesn't one?
Guten Tag!
Really!
How do you manage, darling?
I've started giving English lessons,
but actually I'm a novelist.
A novelist! How perfectly
marvellous! Are you published?
My first novel, yes. I haven't yet
found a publisher for the second.
Has it sold simply thousands?
About 300, actually.
The one you write about me
shall sell by the million.
About you? Of course, darling.
Jean Ross, woman of mystery!
I'm not sure you're that mysterious.
Do you know, I think we're
going to get along famously.
You will write about
me, won't you darling?
Maybe.
One can't afford to wait, sweetie.
This whole thing is about
to collapse around our ears.
Carpe diem, darling!
Oh, damn!
I suppose I'd better
meet the old goat.
He's promised to introduce me
to Max Reinhardt, but I don't
believe him for a second.
Why are men always
such beasts, darling?
Chris, could you be an angel and
lend me 10 marks?
I haven't got a bean for the taxi.
"She said his underpants
were like camel hair,
"the sort of thing John The
Baptist might wear."
You're very quiet.
A touch of sunstroke.
You know, coming to Berlin
is the first honest thing
I've done in my life,
and it's all thanks to you.
I doubt your mother
sees it quite like that.
He's rather lovely, don't you think?
Caspar!
So tell me, Herr Isherwood,
have you come to Berlin
to sample the culture?
I wouldn't quite say that.
In fact, I'm rather anti-culture.
Like the Nazis?
Oh, no, not in that way.
It's just that I'm rather put off
by culture worshippers.
I find them somewhat
precious and prone to gushing.
Do you find me somewhat precious
and prone to gushing?
No, I'm sure you're not,
but the danger is that one
can use culture worship
as a substitute for engaging
with the messy business of living.
You see, I find all this so very
interesting, that you are a writer
but do not like culture.
It is my belief that culture
raises us from the beasts.
I wonder, Herr Landauer, why you have
employed me to teach you English.
You seem to speak it perfectly well.
One has to... How do you say?
..keep in practice.
Good. What exactly is it that you do?
I am a shopkeeper.
A shopkeeper?
That is precisely what I am.
As in Landauer's Department Store?
Yes.
That's where I buy my socks.
Do you engage with politics,
Herr Isherwood? Actually, no.
I'm not really a joiner. I seem to
be constitutionally incapable of
bringing myself to the required...
pitch of enthusiasm.
I have my sympathies, of course.
We can no longer afford
the luxury of sympathy.
I rather suspect I'm best equipped
to observe and record.
That will not be an option.
When the Nazis come to power,
we must take to the streets.
Not only Jews like myself,
but all of us, Herr Isherwood.
We must take to the streets
and stay there, even when
the Storm Troopers start firing.
I'm not sure I'd hack
it as a street fighter.
Forgive me, but are you not then
as guilty as your detested
culture worshippers
for refusing to engage
with the whole messy business?
I think, maybe, we should
all play to our strengths.
Perhaps we will practise
the irregular verbs?
You like that, huh?
It's like silk.
If you go to gymnasium,
Christoph, you be like me
and Johnny Weissmuller.
I'm not so sure about that.
And then you do this, ja?
No! No! Caspar!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
You like, ja? Nein! Ja?
Nein! Ja! Ja!
Christoph?
Yes? You got 10 marks?
Yes.
YODELLING
I pay you tonight, ja?
Of course you will.
Oh, dear!
Let us thank God, Christoph,
that we are both normal.
Aren't boys marvellous?
Their shape and their voices,
their smell and the way they move.
And they can be so...
romantic,
whereas girls...
No, I'm glad I'm like I am.
Thank God for public school!
He's not coming, is he?
As I've told you, my dear,
intimacy's just business to them.
So you think if I
stopped giving him money...?
No, no, Caspar and I,
it's more than just business.
They're desperate for cash
and they'll do anything for it.
But what he says to me... He'll
tell you anything you want to hear.
Still, what do I know about romance?
I'm a poet, not
a fucking journalist.
I've booked my ticket
back to England. Already?
Father's allowance has dried up
and I really must get this
fissure in my rectum seen to.
I hope that wasn't me.
I'm touched by your concern,
but really, Christopher,
you mustn't flatter yourself.
Can't imagine why I
chose to leave him
How could I have been so cruel?
After all
he loved me without question
Still I left him like a fool
If I woke him late
at night complaining
"I'm on my last cigarette"
He'd say "I'll be
over in a minute
"Darling, please don't get upset"
Peter, Peter... #
Gute Nacht. Gute Nacht.
That's not what I was expecting at
all. I suspect that's a compliment,
so thank you, darling.
Oh, I'm so thrilled you're here.
Bobby, sweetie. Good job, hon!
Oh, I'm in heaven! Chris
darling, this is Bobby Gilbert.
He does something frantically
important in something or other.
I'm in steel.
And this is Chris Isherwood.
Christopher. Hey, Chris.
Any day now Bobby's going
to whisk me off to Hollywood,
aren't you, darling? You bet!
And I've told him all about you. Oh?
Chris is absolutely my best friend.
He's the writer. Oh, yeah, right!
Would I have read anything
of yours, Chris?
Oh, no, but I've told him if he
really sticks at it,
he could write something
really great like
Noel Coward or something.
Couldn't you, darling?
What's the matter, Christoph?
You don't like me tonight?
Eh, Christoph? What's the matter?
I don't like being taken for an
idiot, that's what's the matter.
You say you'll meet me,
then don't turn up.
You take money off me and say
you'll pay me back, but never do.
It's getting to the point where I
can't believe anything you tell me.
Yes, I understand. I understand.
Some of the girls I see,
they are like that.
They say things, then let me
down, and that makes me mad.
And when I see them, I always
pay them and never hit them
and still they let me down!
But you know, Christoph, some of
them, they are so beautiful,
and they make me so happy
and I just forget how mad I am.
You bastard!
Your eyes, Christoph.
They shine so bright
when you're hot for me.
Ah, Caspar. He gave
me a cheap gold-plated bracelet.
Probably an unwanted
gift from some admirer.
He fastened it around my wrist.
A love token, I fondly thought,
but then he disappeared.
I asked around, but no-one
knew where he was.
I should've listened to Wystan.
Perhaps it was just a
business transaction after all.
Zwei Minuten, meine Liebe.
It must be simply marvellous
to be a novelist. Why's that?
Because when people are utterly
foul to you, you can sit
down and write about them
and tell the world how perfectly
vile they are and make simply
pots of money out of it.
It hasn't quite worked out
like that yet.
Darling, be an angel
and light my ciggie.
Actually, I've been offered the
chance to earn a bit extra. Take it.
Writing the occasional letter from
Berlin and doing the odd book review.
Darling, that's marvellous!
Let's have champagne!
It's for a magazine called Action.
Oswald Mosley's rag?
Oh, you know it then?
Of course I know it.
I may wear green nail varnish,
but I'm not completely vacuous.
Why DO you wear green nail varnish?
Have you said yes? Not yet.
You won't. I wouldn't write
anything political.
Writing anything for that lot would
be making a statement of sorts,
even if it was the cookery column.
The money would come in awfully
handy. Christopher, you can't!
But, Jean... I wouldn't talk to you
again and that's an end to it.
I was just testing the water.
I wasn't really going to
write anything for them.
Honestly, I wasn't.
I'm one to talk. Gosh, you know
the things I've done for money.
People here are so strange.
They've simply no idea,
and the Nazis are getting
more and more of a foothold
and they just seem to accept it.
I've even heard some
talk of a brighter future
as if all this ghastliness
were a price worth paying.
They're going to get the most awful
shock unless they make a stand,
Which you and I must do.
We must not throw in the towel.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I don't really know.
WHIPPING, CRIES OF PAIN
Mein Gott!
Morning, darlings. Gott im Himmel!
HE CRIES OUT
Oh, dear! I do hope he
won't do himself a mischief.
He ought to be more careful
at his time of life.
HE CRIES OUT
Oh, Bobby darling!
You do that so well.
You must teach me one day
how to catch it in my mouth.
You bet, honey.
Thank you. To The Memorial.
The Memorial.
Yeah! So, do you reckon
I'd enjoy your book, Chris?
Well, I'm not sure what sort
of books you like, Bobby.
What do you think, hon?
I haven't a clue, darling, but I
expect it's astoundingly brilliant!
And the point is, it's published.
His second novel in print,
and he's even had a
letter of congratulation
from EM Forester. Forster. Wow!
It won't be long till our
Chris is just as famous.
Say, who's that guy in the wig?
BOTH: Gerald.
Well, I could swear that Gerald
was peeking through the keyhole
while I was in the john.
When I came out, he didn't know
where to look.
I expect he knew
exactly where to look.
Yeah. Right.
Bobby, darling. I adore champagne.
We'll have it every day, won't we,
once you' whisk me off to Hollywood?
Sure thing.
Bobby! Naughty Bobby!
SHOUTING
GLASS SMASHES
Excuse me.
Entschuldigung, bitte.
I was in a cafe and you were...
Do you remember?
No. Well, why should you?
Mein Name ist Christopher.
Perhaps you'd like
to go for ein Bier?
No. OK.
I'm sorry.
His name was Heinz. He was innocent,
vulnerable and uncritical.
A boy I could protect and
cherish as my very own.
Jean thought it was all frightfully
jolly and decided I was at last doing
my bit for the class struggle.
And as Heinz and I drew closer,
I had no hesitation
in falling in love.
SHE COUGHS
She need to be in hospital,
but there is no bed.
Mutti...
SHE COUGHS
Gerald! Come on out.
I know you are in there!
He's not here! Where is he, then?
Hamburg. Hamburg?!
Well, when he's back, tell him
if I don't get what I want,
he knows what to expect.
Don't you, Gerald?
Some people seem to be utterly
lacking in consideration.
Tell me what it's about, Gerald.
A business transaction, that's
all, that went slightly awry.
What sort of business?
You know, Christopher,
you're looking as joyous
as the first day of spring.
Gerald!
I was offered a small fee
to help someone get his
hands on a police dossier.
Yes?
Actually, it was a positively
glacial sum that would have
paid off my debts at a stroke,
and do you know what?
The wretched man simply vanished.
Disparu without paying
me a single pfennig.
So who was that at the door?
A philistine, my dear.
Claiming interest on a little loan.
A loan for what? Oh, do keep up,
dear boy! For the money I needed to
bribe the police to get the dossier.
What on earth were you thinking of?
The trouble is everyone's so
greedy nowadays. And dishonest.
Simply can't trust a soul.
Gerald. Yes?
Your wig's slipped.
Oh!
DOOR CREAKS
No!
THUMP
'My dear Christopher, I've had
to leave Berlin at very short notice
'which made it impossible
for me to communicate with you.
'Our friend at the door finally
lost patience and matters
got a little out of hand.
'Try not to think too
hardly of me, dear boy.
'That would be more
than I could bear.
'As always,
your affectionate Gerald.'
They give her bed at last.
Ah, that's very good
news, Frau Neddermayer.
She make dress to look
nice in sanatorium.
Oh, I see. Well, it would be, um...
SHE COUGHS
To see his Nazi friends.
SHE BREATHES DEEPLY
SHE COUGHS
The last Kaiser
always mistrusted Berlin.
He saw it as a centre of,
how do you say, dissidence?
Yes.
What with the leftist working class
and the intellectual avant garde.
I'm wondering if the working
class is as leftist as one imagines.
It was not that long ago, Herr
Isherwood, that we came close
to a communist revolution,
but they lacked a strong leader.
This is where Adolf Hitler
has been so very clever
and exploited the situation.
Ever since the Treaty of Versaille
and then the Depression brought
the country to its knees
with banks failing and savings
disappearing, the poor and
unemployed see him as their saviour.
And the Nazis organise everywhere -
in bars and clubs
and schools like a virus.
I see. Ja. Like a virus.
But I am sure
that all this you know.
Or do you spend
too much time at play?
Berlin can be very distracting.
We must all stand by our
own kind, Christopher.
Whatever the cost.
I can't give you
anything but love
Baby
That's the only
thing I've plenty of
Baby
Dream a while
Scheme a while
We're sure to find
Happiness
And I guess
All those things
you've always pined for... #
I can't give you
anything but love
Baby! #
Oh, bravo! Did your mother
teach you to cook? Ja.
She's not very well,
she is at the sanitorium. I did say.
Yes, of course.
So tell me, what exactly is this?
Pig.
Oh, pork! How lovely!
Ja. It is, er...
Pork rib? Delicious!
I think he means lung.
Ja! Schweinelunge!
Oh. Golly.
And then before my very
eyes I saw him turn from
prince to frog and I thought, "Did
I really let that make love to me?"
This is my brother Gerhardt.
Gerhardt, it's a
pleasure to meet you.
Won't you join us? We're having
the most perfect evening.
I think your brother
is simply divine and he's
cooked us a marvellous meal.
You are no longer
welcome here, Herr Isherwood.
He doesn't mean it.
May I ask why?
Before our father went to the
Western Front, he said to me,
"Gerhardt, look out for your
mother and your brother."
I have always tried to honour
his memory, but with no work and
no money, it's been difficult.
I'm sure it is. Yes. But now
there is hope, Herr Isherwood,
and Herr Hitler is the reason.
Oh, for goodness sake!
He understands men like me.
He wants to make us proud again,
hold our heads up high again. The
Communists, they had their chance.
The Nazis are the people's
party now. This is your friends
at night school talking, Gerhardt.
Did he just call me a tart?
We do not want you
here, Herr Isherwood.
You and your kind.
Oh, how frightfully rude!
So take your pick, Heinz.
Make your father proud...
..or shame us all.
But Gerhardt...
Honestly, darling, how you can
leave poor Heinz with that monster?
I'm sure he can stand up for himself!
We'll probably find him hacked
into little pieces at
the bottom of a canal.
And you didn't help matters
addressing Gerhardt like you were
Queen Mary at an investiture.
And after all the trouble he
went to with that pig lung hash.
You bastards, you bastards!
For Christ's sake, Jean!
Brutes!
Filthy rotten brutes!
Shut up! For God's sake!
You're just as bad, every one
of you! Don't worry, darling...
It's over now. Can we get a taxi?
Can somebody please get a taxi!
Cracken house, ja?
You get used to it,
that's the danger.
The uniforms and the raids,
the street-fights
and the beatings...
We can't just stand by, can we?
No.
We can't, you know.
We really can't.
Gerhardt...
Such a pity,
isn't it, that we don't make love?
After all, there's
nothing else to do.
We could go to the movies.
I haven't got two
pfennigs to rub together.
Jean?
Jean, what is it?
Hollywood's off.
Oh, Jean, I'm so sorry.
"Dear Jean, I have to
go back to the States.
"Some emergency at HQ.
"It was fun, wasn't it?
"Bobby."
What a complete bastard.
Typical bloody American.
Flaky as hell!
You fancied him rotten!
That's beside the point. Come here.
And he was a most marvellous lover.
He was the best...
Oh, Jean. Poor darling...
He did leave me a little something.
So he bloody should!
But I shan't be keeping it.
Men say that they can be faithful
Simply I smile to myself
New love is always so novel
Faithfulness is but pretence
Now it is all but forgotten
But yesterday I still possessed
Love affords time that is blissful
Loyalty still makes no sense
I don't know to whom I belong
It would be such
a shame to end up on my own
If I make myself true to one
How another will surely
be sad and alone
Should such a beauty
belong to one person
No surely
the sun and the stars
They belong to us all
I don't know to whom I belong
I believe
I only
belong to myself. #
They come, they go,
and so it will always be.
Good morning, Herr Issyvoo.
Guten Morgan, Fraulein Thurau.
What a beautiful morning!
Even the sun seems to have
come out for Herr Hitler.
Oh, Herr Issyvoo?
The police have been round.
The police?
They were asking about my lodgers.
What did they want to know?
"Routine", they said.
RECORDING OF HITLER PLAYS
Hein, un Moment. Caspar!
I would remind you, sir,
that this is a Jewish store
and that there is now an
official anti-Jewish boycott.
Where have you been? I've been
looking everywhere for you.
You disappeared.
I didn't know what had happened.
Caspar!
I need to buy a pair of socks.
Shame!
Shame!
Beruf?
"Street-sweeper"? No. Maybe...
"domestic servant", or...
Yes, why not? "Domestic servant".
Heinz? I cannot come, Christoph.
But of course you can.
No, it is too dangerous...
for you, for me...
It's even more dangerous if you stay.
For Gerhardt. Gerhardt?
He's one of them, for God's sake!
He's my brother! We're brothers too,
Heinz, and more, much more besides!
And this is my country.
Not at the moment, it isn't.
It will be again one day, I've
no doubt, but in the meantime...
You do not miss home?
I have no home. This is home...
wherever I am.
We should be where we belong.
We are where we belong - together.
We must stand together.
We're responsible for each other,
as individuals. Don't you see?
You have to come with me.
I want you to.
Now you do, but in a week? A month?
I'll still want you Heinz.
Heinz. Of course I will.
YODELLING
I am sure I do not know,
Herr Issyvoo,
what makes you want to leave Berlin.
How can I best put this, Fraulein?
Adolf Hitler.
Ach, the Fuhrer!
One day it's Bruning, then von
Papen, the next von Schleicher,
then it's Hitler.
We must all make the best of it,
Herr Issyvoo. I am staying.
Most Germans are staying.
And besides, where else would we go?
Well, this is your homeland,
Fraulein. I understand that.
But Heinz and I, we want to get out.
We want to... Travel.
But why? To go here? To go there?
What is the point?
Soon no-one will be left.
Herr Hamilton has gone,
Fraulein Ross,
now you...
You get used to it.
You get used to anything.
CLOCK TICKS
Is your room...satisfactory?
Mummy, he's not retarded.
Where you sleep, is good, yes?
Yes. I sleep good.
Yes. Good. Thank you.
How long have you known Christopher?
Mummy... Shush!
I know Christopher
one year and one half.
Oh, that long, and he's hardly
mentioned you, if at all.
And how long are you staying
in our country? Two weeks.
I'm sure Heinz can answer for
himself, can't you, Heinz?
Two weeks.
You see?
What a shame it's not longer.
Two weeks is as long
as his permit allows.
Then maybe another time.
What is that?
Oh, now... Christopher!
That, Heinz, is Wyberslegh Hall,
part of the family estate.
It's in Cheshire
in the north of England.
I painted it, as a matter of fact.
You paint it?
Yes.
It's very good.
Thank you, Heinz.
That is the house where
I gave birth to Christopher.
Yes? And very difficult it was too.
I was in labour for 18 hours.
18 hours! Imagine that!
Mummy, please!
Oh, dear, that was rather
modern of me, wasn't it?
But it was worth it.
He was the most delightful baby.
I'm sure Heinz isn't
remotely interested.
He had the loveliest skin
and long slitty eyes...
just like a Jap.
You see, of course he's interested.
You live in the past, Mummy.
Perhaps I do, Christopher,
because it's always there
and never lets me down.
Do you have a mummy, Heinz?
She's dead. Oh.
Oh, I am sorry. Oh, dear.
Christopher's daddy's dead.
He was killed in the war.
He was my daddy too.
Yes, dear, but you hardly knew him.
He was killed by the Germans.
What are you thinking of, hmm!
I'm not blaming Heinz, darling.
I'm simply filling him in.
And for your information,
Heinz's daddy was also
killed on the Western Front.
Well, there you are, you see.
That's what wars do - kill people.
Toast?
He's a nice boy.
Well-mannered.
A street-cleaner, you say?
There's no reason a street-cleaner
can't be well-mannered.
No, dear. No reason at all.
How lovely to have a job like
ordinary people.
But who'd have you, my darling?
You seem to be inept at pretty much
everything. Don't speak to him
like that!
It's entirely your fault
he's like he is. Like what?
Richard, dear, we're talking.
It's terrible he has to go back,
and now Germany's withdrawn
from the League Of Nations.
Yes, that is rather troubling.
I must think of a way of
getting him out for good.
But why should that
be your responsibility?
Surely he knows people who can help.
He has absolutely no-one, Mummy,
except for a brother
who's disowned him,
and, besides, I want it to be my
responsibility.
So what will you do?
Get him another permit?
Or even another nationality.
Of course,
you could always adopt him.
Darling! I don't think so!
Are you sure he wouldn't
be happier in Germany?
It is his home, after all.
It's where he belongs.
And he isn't a Jew or anything.
You've no idea. It's Nazi Germany
we're talking about.
It's not just the Jews who
are being victimised.
I do read the papers, darling.
I'm fully aware that the
Nazis have done some bad things.
Although one hears that Herr
Hitler's done some good things too.
Dear God!
If it weren't for that wretched boy
Auden, dragging you off there...
I assure you, he
didn't need to drag me.
But you must do as you wish,
Christopher, as you always do...
so long as you realise
what you might be taking on.
Right. We're going to have to
mail money to him in Berlin... "We"?
..So he can support himself until he
comes back here, and if you write
a letter inviting him to stay...
Christopher! ..Then
I'm sure they'll give him a much
longer permit, maybe even for keeps.
You can't do that!
You'll find that I can.
But you haven't proved your case!
Mr Isherwood,
your mother invites a foreign
servant to her home without
the requisite permit,
you send the boy money telling
him to claim it was a bequest,
which could be construed as
an attempt to deceive His Majesty's
Immigration Service,
but then
we have the letter you wrote.
May I?
"I am counting the days
until your arrival.
"I've been so lonely without you."
A bit curious, don't you think,
the way it's written? A bit...
what's the word? Queer?
Thank you, Mr Auden.
What a boon to have a poet on hand!
You can't send him back!
Christopher... No!
God knows what they might do!
Not my responsibility.
So an alien has no rights
whatsoever in this democracy
that men have laid down
their lives for.
I hope, should the moment come,
that you too will be ready
to make the sacrifice.
Make no mistake, I shall appeal!
You can write to the Home Secretary
for all the good it will do.
Come on.
As soon as I saw that rat,
I knew we were done for.
They're all the bloody same!
Oh no, he's one of us.
It stands out a mile.
I'm sorry.
You seem out of sorts.
Do I?
It's Heinz, isn't it?
Goodbyes are always sad.
As sad as dying.
I'll be seeing him soon enough.
That's right. Yeah.
No need to be sad.
I suppose being a writer,
you want to tidy everything up
and make it make sense.
But things never do
quite make sense, do they?
Not really.
No.
This Sally Bowles character...
is she based on anyone?
Yes, in a manner of speaking.
And what about Mr Norris?
Yes, I suppose he is too. I thought
we might first meet him on a train.
Oh, yes. Trains are always good.
You can't go wrong with a train.
Where were we?
Full stop, close quotation marks.
Good. It must be very polarising,
this Nazi business.
Hard to sit on the fence,
I'd imagine. Yes, it is.
Berlin's fairly seething, what with
all the poverty and wounded pride.
I'd say communism was
the best hope for peace.
Then why not stay here
and join the Party?
I can't do that!
I have Heinz to consider.
Yes, Heinz. Of course.
So where will you go?
Amsterdam, probably.
For the time being.
That's all one can say, isn't it?
"For the time being."
It always breaks my heart
a little to see you leave.
You should be used to it by now.
Oh, no, I'll never get used to it...
..And how awful if I did.
I'll be back.
I always am.
'And so once again I cast off
from England and threw
in my lot with Heinz.
'Two lost souls wandering
around Europe on the brink...
'I have to admit I felt a little
guilty flitting from country to
country to save a single man,
'whilst others were
preparing to save the world.
'But then our luck ran out and Heinz
was arrested by the Gestapo,
'and that was that.'
Daily Worker, ladies?
No appeasement! Fight the fascists!
Excuse me, Miss...
I'm exercising my democratic right!
Only you would choose to sell
The Daily Worker in Knightsbridge.
I have no say in the matter.
I go where the Party tells me.
You're looking impossibly young.
Are you ever going to age?
I do hope not. My God! The varnish!
I somehow felt that red
was more appropriate.
I must confess
I carry it with me everywhere.
Isn't it funny, darling, that
you're the one that became famous?
And you know I must say
I'm rather enjoying it,
and meanwhile poor Heinz...
Well...I dread to think
what he's being subjected to.
A year labouring for the state
followed by two years in the army.
It's frightfully harsh.
It could be worse -
he might have got carted
off to a concentration camp.
You did all you could.
I wonder if I did?
I wonder if I did, really?
And what's worse,
I even feel relieved.
Hmm.
Do you ever miss Berlin? Oh, no.
I never miss anything.
Sometimes I wonder if I
shouldn't have had that kid.
I think I'd just about have
cut the mustard as a mother.
I'd tuck him in,
and I'd sing to him.
And then I'd go out and fuck
filthy old men to pay for the brat!
Then why not marry and have another?
Because I've lost my faith in men.
Well, that's a shame.
I have simply no use
for them any more.
Not even you, darling.
Oh, well,
back to the revolution.
Might we see each other again?
Goodbye, Chris.
Goodbye.
'It seems everyone's caught
communism like flu.'
I think it's fair to say that the
closest we've come to solidarity
with the workers is
sleeping with them.
Well, that's a cause of sorts.
The only cause you really care
about, Christopher, is yourself.
Isn't that rather unkind?
Hmm. But you've turned
it into an art form -
rather successfully, as it happens.
I used to be a little
in love with you.
You knew that, didn't you?
Yes, I thought you did.
You're lucky - you're not
burdened by the concept of sin.
And it is a sin, Christopher...
although I fully intend
to carry on sinning.
Please, don't start on about God!
You're going to have
such a conversion one
of these days, my dear.
I do loathe the sea.
It's so wet and sloppy.
I don't belong here.
I'm not sure I belong anywhere.
I rather like being a foreigner.
I wonder where we might end up?
'Wystan was right.
'I've never known about
anybody except me. You see,
'I was never able to commit - I only
ever sort of added to the chorus.
'And now, of course, politics are
more and more about the individual.
'The gay liberation movement seems to
have taken me to its heart.
'It's very nice of them, really.
'A cause at last!
'But then I think it always was
my cause. And somehow, you know...
'it makes sense of
what I was trying to do for Heinz.
'All those years ago...'
Christoph?
You write again about Berlin?
Yes, for a British newspaper.
A lot has changed, ja?
What's left of it.
When the city was cut in pieces,
we end up in the Russian sector.
Rotten luck, eh?
We all hate the Russians, Christoph.
We would much rather be here
in the West Zone.
Maybe one day.
My friend Christoph,
the famous writer.
I suppose you could say that.
Tell me,
there are skyscrapers in America?
Oh, yes.
And you see Hollywood?
I live near there, actually.
And the Grand Canyon? You see that?
Yes. It's...
very big.
And cowboys?
No, I haven't seen too many of them.
I feel guilty, Heinz.
All that I made you suffer. I should
never have taken you out of Germany.
But Christoph, you change my life.
What we had, what we did,
I would not miss for the world.
Look, Christoph...
My wife, Hilde.
Well, she looks...
very nice!
She's a good girl.
And she doesn't ask questions.
That's all right then.
And this is my son...
..Christoph.
Christoph?
Ja.
Well.
You know, Christoph,
you are not getting younger.
That's the way it tends to go.
You live alone, yes?
At the moment.
That is not good, to live alone.
You need a family around you,
to keep you company, to
look after you when you are sick.
Heinz, I'm not decrepit!
But listen, Christoph,
we could be your family. What?
Hilde, Christoph and I.
Out there in...California.
Ah, well...
Erm, I'm not so sure about that.
You see, the life I lead...
My, my plans are so uncertain.
I'd have to think it over.
Look, we'll see. See how it goes.
And I'll write you,
we'll keep in touch.
You do understand, don't you, Heinz?
You do...don't you?
Yes. I...I understand.
Fraulein!
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Oh!
When the city was divided, we got
the Americans. Oh, I am so happy!
We are all so happy!
I thank God the Russians
didn't get us. Communism!
Oh, Herr Issyvoo,
you look like a child!
It's lovely to see you, Fraulein.
Herr Issyvoo, Herr Issyvoo!
Ach, the last year of the war,
Herr Issyvoo! Yes. It was terrible.
We were in the cellar nearly
all the time, holding each other.
We prayed so much,
we got quite religious!
Ah! Is the yodeller still there?
No, thank God! The Nazis shot her.
It's the one good thing they did!
Another survivor, eh, Fraulein?
Another survivor.
It was damaged a little,
but I mended it.
For you.
No, I couldn't.
Take it, please,
and when you look at it,
you will think of Berlin,
and Fraulein Thurau,
and smile.
Thank you.

Now, remember,
keep your shoulders back.
Okay, put your arm around your brother.
That's it.
Right, and freeze.
Okay, one more.
Now, just to review,
you're going to follow along
the procession
until you get to the headmaster.
And at that point, he will indicate to you
to light the candles of the boys.
- All right.
- All right, boys, let's settle down.
Banners up.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys,
the light of knowledge.
One hundred years ago, in 1859,
41 boys sat in this room
and were asked the same question
that now greets you
at the start of each semester.
Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?
Tradition, honor,
discipline, excellence.
In her first year, Welton Academy
graduated five students.
Last year, we graduated 51.
And more than 75 percent of those
went on to the Ivy League.
This kind of accomplishment
is the result of fervent dedication
to the principles taught here.
This is why you parents
have been sending us your sons.
This is why we are the best
preparatory school in the United States.
As you know,
our beloved Mr. Portius
of the English Department
retired last term.
You will have the opportunity later
to meet his replacement,
Mr. John Keating,
himself an honors graduate
of this school.
And who, for the past several years,
has been teaching at the highly regarded
Chester School in London.
- Richard, you forgot your bag.
- Hi, Charlie. Hey, how you doing?
Don't worry,
I've got your club assignment.
I'm glad you could come by.
- Thrilling ceremony as usual, Dr. Nolan.
- You've been away too long.
- Hello, Dr. Nolan.
- How've you been?
- This is our youngest, Todd.
- Mr. Anderson.
You have some big shoes to fill,
young man.
Your brother was one of our finest.
Thank you.
- Lovely ceremony.
- Thank you. I'm so glad you liked it.
- Gale.
- John.
Good to see you again.
- Hello, Mr. Nolan.
- Neil.
We expect great things from you
this year.
- Thank you, sir.
- Well, he won't disappoint us.
- Right, Neil?
- I'll do my best, sir.
- Come on, son. No tears, now.
- Chin up. Chin up.
- I don't want to go here.
- I love you.
I'll walk you over.
Do your lessons.
Hey. I hear we're gonna be roommates.
- I'm Neil Perry.
- I'm Todd Anderson.
- Why'd you leave Balincrest?
- My brother went here.
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
Well, this is in case of his sinuses.
And, oh, if he can't swallow,
you give him one of these.
And if he has trouble breathing,
you can give him some of those.
- Fine, yes.
- Ooh.
- Did you remember your vaporizer?
- Yeah, it's in my room.
- Hey, how's it going, Neil?
- Hey, Knox.
- Neil. Study group tonight?
- Yeah, sure.
Business as usual, huh?
Hey, I heard you got the new kid.
Looks like a stiff. Ha, ha.
Oops.
Listen, don't mind Cameron.
He's born with his foot in his mouth.
You know what I mean?
Rumor has it you did summer school.
Yep. Chemistry.
My father thought I should get ahead.
- How was your summer, Slick?
- Keen.
- Meeks, door, closed.
- Yes, sir.
Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?
Travesty, horror, decadence, excrement.
Okay. Study group.
Meeks aced Latin,
I didn't quite flunk English.
So if you want, we got our study group.
Sure, Cameron asked me too.
Anyone mind including him?
What's his specialty, bootlicking?
- He's your roommate.
- That's not my fault.
- Uh, I'm sorry. My name is Steven Meeks.
- Oh, this is Todd Anderson.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Charlie Dalton.
- I'm Knox Overstreet.
- Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson.
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Well.
Valedictorian. National Merit scholar.
Oh, well. Welcome to Hell-ton.
It's every bit as tough as they say,
unless you're a genius like Meeks.
He flatters me.
That's why I help him with Latin.
And English, and trig.
It's open.
Father, I thought you'd gone.
- Mr. Perry, sir.
- Keep your seats, fellas.
Neil, I've just spoken to Mr. Nolan.
I think that you're taking too many
extracurricular activities this semester,
and I've decided
that you should drop the school annual.
- But I'm the assistant editor this year.
- Well, I'm sorry, Neil.
But, father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair.
Fellas, could you excuse us
for a moment?
- Don't you ever dispute me in public.
- Father, I wasn't...
After you've finished medical school
and you're on your own,
then you can do as you damn well please,
but until then, you do as I tell you.
- That clear?
- Yes, sir, I'm sorry.
Ahem. You know how much this means
to your mother, don't you?
Yes, sir.
You know me,
always taking on too much.
Well, that's my boy.
Now, listen, you need anything,
you let us know, huh?
Yes, sir.
Why doesn't he let you
do what you want?
Yeah, Neil. Tell him off.
It couldn't get any worse.
Oh, that's rich.
Like you guys tell your parents off?
Mr. Future-Lawyer
and Mr. Future-Banker.
Okay, so I don't like it
any more than you do.
Don't tell me how to talk to my father.
You guys are the same.
All right, all right. Jesus.
- What are you gonna do?
- What I have to do.
Drop the annual.
I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it.
It's just a bunch of jerks
trying to impress Nolan.
I don't care.
I don't give a damn about any of it.
Well, uh, Latin?
Eight o'clock in my room?
- Yes.
- Sounds good.
- Todd, you're welcome to join us.
- Yeah, come along, pal.
Thanks.
McAllister:
Slow down, boys.
Slow down,
you horrible phalanx of pubescence.
Pick three laboratory experiments
from the project list
and report on them every five weeks.
The first 20 questions
at the end of Chapter 1 are due tomorrow.
Again, please.
Your study of trigonometry
requires absolute precision.
Anyone failing to turn in
any homework assignment
will be penalized one point
off their final grade.
Let me urge you now
not to test me on this point.
Hey, Spaz. Spaz.
- Brain damage.
- Shh.
Well, come on.
- Is he kidding?
- He's gotta be.
- Let's go.
- Where?
Let's go, guys.
Okay, go.
O Captain! My Captain!
Who knows where that comes from?
Anybody?
Not a clue?
It's from a poem by Walt Whitman
about Mr. Abraham Lincoln.
Now, in this class,
you can either call me Mr. Keating,
or if you're slightly more daring,
O Captain, My Captain.
Now, let me dispel a few rumors
so they don't fester into facts.
Yes, I too attended Hell-ton
and survived.
And no, at that time, I was not
the mental giant you see before you.
I was the intellectual equivalent
of a 98-pound weakling.
I would go to the beach
and people would kick
copies of Byron in my face.
Now,
Mr. Pitts.
That's a rather unfortunate name.
Mr. Pitts, where are you?
Mr. Pitts, will you open your hymnal
to page 542?
Read the first stanza
of the poem you find there.
"To the Virgins,
To Make Much of Time"?
Yes, that's the one.
Somewhat appropriate, isn't it?
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may
Old time is still a-flying:
And this same flower that smiles to-day
To-morrow will be dying.
Thank you, Mr. Pitts.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may
The Latin term for that sentiment
is carpe diem.
Now, who knows what that means?
Carpe diem, that's "seize the day."
- Very good, Mr.?
- Meeks.
Meeks. Another unusual name.
Seize the day.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may
- Why does the writer use these lines?
- Because he's in a hurry.
No. Ding.
Thanks for playing anyway.
Because we are food for worms, lads.
Because, believe it or not,
each and every one of us in this room
is one day going to stop breathing,
turn cold and die.
I would like you
to step forward over here
and peruse some of the faces
from the past.
You've walked past them many times,
but I don't think
you've really looked at them.
They're not that different from you,
are they?
Same haircuts.
Full of hormones, just like you.
Invincible, just like you feel.
The world is their oyster.
They believe they're destined
for great things, just like many of you.
Their eyes are full of hope, just like you.
Did they wait until it was too late
to make from their lives
even one iota
of what they were capable?
Because, you see, gentlemen,
these boys are now fertilizing daffodils.
But if you listen real close,
you can hear them
whisper their legacy to you.
Go on, lean in.
Listen. You hear it?
Carpe...
Hear it?
Carpe...
Carpe diem.
Seize the day, boys.
Make your lives extraordinary.
- That was weird.
- But different.
Spooky, if you ask me.
Think he'll test us on that stuff?
Oh, come on, Cameron.
Don't you get anything?
What? What?
Let's go, boys. Hustle up in here.
That means you, Dalton.
Who's up for a trig study group tonight?
- Sure.
- Me.
- What?
- I can't make it, guys.
I have to have dinner
at the Danburrys' house tonight.
The Danburrys?
Who are the Danburrys?
Big alums. How'd you swing that?
Friends of my dad's. They're
probably in their 90s or something.
Sounds great, doesn't it?
Anything's better
than Hell-ton hash, Knox.
- I'll second that.
- Yeah, we'll see.
Hey. Coming to the study group tonight?
Uh, no. No, I've got some history
I want to do.
Suit yourself.
Ready, Overstreet?
Ready to go, sir.
Chet, can you get that?
- Can't, Mom.
- I'll get it.
Can I help you?
Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh...
- Dr. Hager.
- Hi.
- This is the Danburrys', right?
- Are you here to see Chet?
- Mrs. Danburry?
- No.
Sorry. Thank you, Chris.
I'm Mrs. Danburry.
- You must be Knox.
- Yes.
Back by 9? Please, come on in.
Chris, come on. What are you doing?
- Chet, I'm coming.
- Knox.
- How are you? Joe Danburry.
- Nice to meet you, sir.
Well, he's the spitting image
of his father, isn't he?
- How is he? Come on in.
- Chris.
He's great.
He just did a big case for GM.
- I know where you're headed.
- I'm coming.
Like father, like son, huh?
- Yes.
- Bishop to queen six.
- All right, I think that's good.
- Another game?
Just replace these numbers here
with X... For X and Y.
- Of course.
- Of course, so, what's the problem?
Do you think I can get in there?
You've been hogging it all day.
How was dinner?
Huh?
How was dinner?
Terrible.
- Awful.
- Why? What happened?
Tonight I met the most beautiful girl
I have ever seen in my entire life.
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
She's practically engaged.
To Chet Danburry.
- The guy could eat a football.
- Too bad.
Too bad? It's worse than too bad, Pitts,
it's a tragedy.
A girl this beautiful
in love with such a jerk.
All the good ones go for jerks,
you know that.
Yeah, forget her. Open your trig book
and try and figure out Problem 5.
I can't just forget her, Cameron.
And I certainly can't think about trig.
- We got it.
- Turn that up.
All right, gentlemen. Five minutes.
- Let's go.
- Did you see her naked?
Very funny, Dalton.
That wouldn't be a radio in your lap,
would it, Mr. Pitts?
No, sir. Science experiment.
Radar.
Gentlemen, open your texts
to Page 21 of the introduction.
Mr. Perry, will you read
the opening paragraph of the preface,
entitled "Understanding Poetry"?
"Understanding Poetry,
by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D."
To fully understand poetry,
we must first be fluent with its meter,
rhyme and figures of speech,
then ask two questions.
One: How artfully has the objective
of the poem been rendered?
And two:
How important is that objective?
Question one rates
the poem's perfection.
Question two rates its importance.
And once these questions
have been answered,
determining the poem's greatness
becomes a relatively simple matter.
If the poem's score for perfection
is plotted on the horizontal of a graph,
and its importance
is plotted on the vertical,
then calculating
the total area of the poem
yields the measure of its greatness.
A sonnet by Byron
might score high on the vertical,
but only average on the horizontal.
A Shakespearean sonnet,
on the other hand,
would score high
both horizontally and vertically,
yielding a massive total area,
thereby revealing the poem
to be truly great.
As you proceed through the poetry
in this book, practice this rating method.
As your ability to evaluate poems
in this manner grows,
"so will your enjoyment
and understanding of poetry."
Excrement.
That's what I think
of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard.
We're not laying pipe.
We're talking about poetry.
How can you describe poetry
like American Bandstand?
"I like Byron.
I give him a 42, but I can't dance to it."
Now, I want you to rip out that page.
Go on. Rip out the entire page.
You heard me. Rip it out.
Rip it out.
Go on. Rip it out.
Thank you, Mr. Dalton.
Tell you what, don't just tear out that
page, tear out the entire introduction.
I want it gone, history.
Leave nothing of it.
Rip it out. Rip.
Be gone, J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D.
Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out.
I want to hear
nothing but ripping of Mr. Pritchard.
We'll perforate it, put it on a roll.
It's not the Bible.
You're not gonna go to hell for this.
Go on. Make a clean tear.
I want nothing left of it.
- We shouldn't be doing this.
- Rip, rip, rip.
Rip it out. Rip.
Rip, rip.
Yeah.
Rip it out.
What the hell is going on here?
I don't hear enough rips.
- Mr. Keating.
- Mr. McAllister.
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here.
I am.
Ah. So you are.
Excuse me.
Keep ripping, gentlemen.
This is a battle, a war.
And the casualties
could be your hearts and souls.
Thank you, Mr. Dalton.
Armies of academics
going forward measuring poetry.
No. We'll not have that here.
No more of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard.
Now, in my class, you will learn
to think for yourselves again.
You will learn to savor
words and language.
No matter what anybody tells you,
words and ideas can change the world.
Now, I see that look in Mr. Pitts' eye,
like 19th-century literature
has nothing to do with going
to business school or medical school.
Right? Maybe.
Mr. Hopkins,
you may agree with him, thinking,
"Yes, we should simply
study our Mr. Pritchard
and learn our rhyme and meter
and go quietly about the business
of achieving other ambitions."
I have a little secret for you. Huddle up.
Huddle up.
We don't read and write poetry
because it's cute.
We read and write poetry because
we are members of the human race.
And the human race
is filled with passion.
And medicine, law, business, engineering,
these are noble pursuits,
and necessary to sustain life.
But poetry, beauty, romance, love,
these are what we stay alive for.
To quote from Whitman:
O me! O life!
Of the questions of these recurring;
Of the endless trains of the faithless...
Of cities filled with the foolish;
What good amid these, O me, O life?
Answer.
That you are here...
That life exists, and identity;
That the powerful play goes on
And you may contribute a verse.
That the powerful play goes on
And you may contribute a verse.
What will your verse be?
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly grateful.
Amen.
Quite an interesting class
you gave today, Mr. Keating.
Sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister.
There's no need to apologize.
It was very fascinating.
- Misguided though it was.
- You think so?
You take a big risk by encouraging them
to become artists, John.
When they realize that they're not
Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,
they'll hate you for it.
We're not talking artists, George,
we're talking free thinkers.
Free thinkers at 17?
Funny, I never pegged you as a cynic.
Not a cynic.
A realist.
Show me the heart
Unfettered by foolish dreams
And I'll show you a happy man.
But only in their dreams
Can men be truly free
'Twas always thus
And always thus will be.
- Tennyson?
- No, Keating.
Hey, I found his senior annual
in the library.
Listen to this:
Captain of the soccer team,
editor of the school annual,
Cambridge bound,
thigh man, and the Dead Poets Society.
"Man most likely to do anything."
Thigh man. Mr. K was a hell-raiser.
- What's the Dead Poets Society?
- Is there a picture?
- Nothing, no other mention of it.
- That boy there, see me after lunch.
Mr. Keating.
Mr. Keating.
Sir?
Say something.
O Captain, My Captain?
Gentlemen.
We were just looking in your old annual.
Oh, my God.
No, that's not me.
Stanley "The Tool" Wilson.
- God.
- What was the Dead Poets Society?
I doubt the present administration
would look too favorably upon that.
Why? What was it?
Gentlemen, can you keep a secret?
Sure.
The Dead Poets were dedicated
to sucking the marrow out of life.
That's a phrase from Thoreau we would
invoke at the beginning of every meeting.
See, we would gather
at the old Indian cave
and take turns reading from Thoreau,
Whitman, Shelley, the biggies.
Even some of our own verse.
And in the enchantment of the moment,
we'd let poetry work its magic.
You mean it was a bunch of guys
sitting around reading poetry?
No, Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just guys.
We weren't a Greek organization,
we were romantics.
And we didn't just read poetry,
we let it drip from our tongues like honey.
Spirits soared, women swooned,
and gods were created, gentlemen.
Not a bad way to spend an evening, eh?
Thank you, Mr. Perry,
for this stroll down amnesia lane.
Burn that. Especially my picture.
- Dead Poets Society.
- What?
I say we go tonight.
- Tonight?
- Wait a minute.
- Everybody in?
- Where's this cave he's talking about?
It's beyond the stream.
I know where it is.
That's miles.
- Sounds boring to me.
- Don't go.
You know how many demerits
we're talking?
So don't come, please.
Look, all I'm saying
is that we have to be careful.
- We can't get caught.
- No shit, Sherlock.
You boys there, hurry up.
All right. Who's in?
- Come on, Neil, Hager's there...
- Forget Hager. No.
Who's in?
I'm in.
I'm warning you. Move.
- Me too.
- I don't know, Neil.
What? Pitts.
- Pittsie, come on.
- His grades are hurting.
- You can help him, Meeks.
- What is this, a midnight study group?
Forget it, you're coming.
Meeks, your grades hurting too?
- I'll try anything once.
- Except sex.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
- What about you, Knox?
- I don't know, Charlie.
Come on, Knox. It'll help you get Chris.
Yeah? How?
- Women swoon. Ha, ha, ha.
- But why do they swoon?
Charlie, tell me why they swoon.
Charlie.
You're not listening.
Look, you follow the stream
to the waterfall.
It's right there. It's got to be like...
I don't know, guys,
it's starting to sound dangerous.
- Well, why don't you stay home?
- You're crazy.
For God's sake,
stop chattering and sit down.
- Todd, are you coming tonight?
- No.
Why not? You were there.
You heard Keating.
Don't you want to
do something about...?
Yes, but, uh...
But what?
Keating said that
everybody took turns reading,
and I don't want to do that.
Gosh, you really have a problem
with that, don't you?
No, I don't have a problem. Neil, I just...
- I don't want to do it, okay?
- All right.
What if you didn't have to read?
What if you just came and listened?
- That's not how it works.
- Forget how it works.
What if they said it was okay?
What? What, are you gonna go up
and ask them if?
- No, no.
- I'll be right back.
Neil. Neil.
Oh, shut up, will you?
That's for my asthma, okay?
Could you give that back, please?
Could you give that back?
What's the matter?
Don't you like snakes?
- You're in.
- Get away from me, okay?
Spaz,
why don't you check your pockets?
Come on, Spaz.
I have to brush my teeth.
Hurry up, get off.
Cut out that racket in there.
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, come on.
- Let's get out of here.
- Go. Shh.
- Yarr! I'm a dead poet.
- Jesus, Charlie.
- Guys, over here. Ha, ha, ha.
- You're funny. You're real funny.
It's too wet.
God,
you trying to smoke us out of here?
No, the smoke's
going right up this opening.
- You okay?
- Arghh.
- Oh, God.
- Clod.
- All right, all right, forget the fire.
- Forget it, forget it.
- Let's go, gentlemen.
- It's like trying to light a swamp.
I hereby reconvene
the Dead Poets Society.
Yay.
Welton Chapter.
The meetings will be conducted
by myself
and the other new initiates now present.
Todd Anderson,
because he prefers not to read,
will keep minutes of the meetings.
I'll now read
the traditional opening message
by society member
Henry David Thoreau.
"I went to the woods
because I wanted to live deliberately.
I wanted to live deep
and suck out all the marrow of life."
I'll second that.
"To put to rout all that was not life,
and not, when I had come to die,
discover that I had not lived."
And Keating's marked
a bunch of other pages.
All right, intermission.
Dig deep, right here.
Right here, lay it down.
On the mud?
We're gonna put our food on the mud?
Meeks, put your coat down.
Picnic blanket.
- Use Meeks' coat.
- "Use Meeks' coat."
Don't keep anything back, either.
You guys are always
bumming my smokes.
- Raisins?
- Yeah.
Wait a minute.
- Who gave us half a roll?
- I'm eating the other half.
- Come on.
- What, you want me to put it back?
It was a dark and rainy night.
And this old lady
who had a passion for jigsaw puzzles
sat by herself in her house at her table
to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.
As she pieced the puzzle together,
she realized to her astonishment
that the image that was formed
was her very own room,
and the figure in the center
of the puzzle, as she completed it,
was herself.
And with trembling hands,
she placed the last four pieces
and stared in horror
at the face of a demented madman
at the window.
The last thing
that this old lady ever heard
was the sound of breaking glass.
- No shit.
- Yes.
This is true. This is true.
I've got one
that's even better than that.
I do. There's a young married couple,
and they're driving through the forest
at night from a long trip.
They run out of gas,
and there's a madman...
- That thing with the hands?
- And he cuts her husband's head off?
- I love that story.
- I told you that one.
You did not.
I got that in, uh, camp in sixth grade.
In a mean abode in the Shanking road
Lived a man named William Bloat;
Now, he had a wife
The plague of his life
Who continually got his goat.
And one day at dawn
With her night shift on
He slit her bloody throat.
- Oh, and it gets worse.
- You want to hear a real poem?
- Want this?
- No, I don't need it. Get this out of here.
- Did you bring one?
- You memorized a poem?
I didn't memorize a poem. Move up.
- An original piece by Charlie Dalton.
- An original piece.
- Take center stage.
- You know this is history, right?
This is history.
Where did you get that?
Teach me to love?
Go teach thy self more wit;
I chief Professor am of it.
The God of Love
If such a thing there be
May learn to love from me.
Wow. Did you write that?
Abraham Cowley.
Okay, who's next?
Alfred Lord Tennyson.
Come, my friends
'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
For my purpose holds
To sail beyond the sunset.
And though we are not now
That strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven;
That which we are, we are
One equal temper of heroic hearts
Made weak by time and fate
But strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find
And not to yield.
Then I had religion
And then I had a vision.
I could not turn
From their revel in derision.
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.
Take it, Meeks. Take it away.
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black
A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.
And don't use "very sad," use...
Come on, Mr. Overstreet, you twerp.
- Morose?
- Exactly, morose.
Now, language was developed
for one endeavor, and that is?
Mr. Anderson? Come on,
are you a man or an amoeba?
Mr. Perry?
- To communicate.
- No. To woo women.
Today we're gonna be talking
about William Shakespeare.
- Oh, God.
- I know.
A lot of you look forward to this
about as much as you look forward
to root canal work.
We're gonna talk about Shakespeare
as someone who writes
something very interesting.
Now, many of you have seen Shakespeare
done very much like this:
O, Titus, bring your friend hither.
But if any of you
have seen Mr. Marlon Brando,
you know Shakespeare can be different.
Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears.
You can also
imagine John Wayne as Macbeth going:
"Well, is this a dagger I see before me?"
"Dogs, sir?"
"Oh, not just now."
"I do enjoy a good dog
once in a while, sir."
You can have yourself
a three-course meal from one dog.
Start with your canine cruditÃ©s,
go to your Fido flambÃ© for main course,
and for dessert, a Pekingese parfait.
"And you can pick your teeth
with a little paw."
Why do I stand up here? Anybody?
- To feel taller.
- No.
Thank you for playing, Mr. Dalton.
I stand upon my desk to remind myself
that we must constantly look at things
in a different way.
You see, the world looks very different
from up here.
You don't believe me?
Come see for yourselves. Come on.
Come on.
Just when you think
you know something,
you have to look at it in another way.
Even though it may seem silly or wrong,
you must try.
I stand upon my desk to remind myself
Consider what you think.
Boys, you must strive
to find your own voice.
Because the longer you wait to begin,
the less likely you are to find it at all.
Thoreau said,
"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation."
Don't be resigned to that. Break out.
Don't just walk off the edge like lemmings,
look around you.
There. There you go, Mr. Priske.
Thank you, yes.
Dare to strike out and find new ground.
Now, in addition to your essays,
I would like you to compose a poem
of your own. An original work.
That's right.
You have to deliver it aloud
in front of the class on Monday.
Bonne chance, gentlemen.
Mr. Anderson?
Don't think that I don't know
that this assignment
scares the hell out of you, you mole.
Take a power train in two.
Three.
- Keep your eyes in the boat.
- Stroke.
- Quick, captain.
- Let's go.
We got it, Pittsie, we got it.
Radio Free America.
Let's do it again.
- I found it.
- You found what?
What I want to do right now.
What's really, really inside of me.
- "A Midsummer Night's Dream"?
- This is it.
- What is that?
- It's a play, dummy.
I know that.
What does it have to do with you?
All right,
they're putting it on at Henley Hall.
Open tryouts. Open tryouts.
- Yes, so?
- So...
I'm gonna act.
Aha!
Yes, yes, I'm gonna be an actor.
Ever since I can remember,
I've wanted to try this.
I even tried to go to summer stock
auditions last year,
but, of course,
my father wouldn't let me.
For the first time in my whole life,
I know what I want to do.
And for the first time, I'm gonna do it!
Whether my father wants me to or not.
Carpe diem!
Neil, Neil, hold on.
How are you gonna be in a play
if your father won't let you?
First, I gotta get the part,
then I can worry about that.
Won't he kill you if he finds out
you went to an audition and didn't tell him?
No. As far as I'm concerned,
he won't have to know about any of this.
- That's impossible.
- Bullshit, nothing's impossible.
Why don't you just call him and ask him?
Maybe he'll say yes.
That's a laugh.
If I don't ask him,
at least I won't be disobeying him.
- Yeah, but if he said no...
- Jesus, Todd, whose side are you on?
I mean,
I haven't even gotten the part yet.
Can't I even enjoy the idea
for a little while?
You're coming to the meeting
this afternoon?
I don't know. Maybe.
Nothing Mr. Keating has to say
means shit to you, does it, Todd?
- What does that mean?
- You're in the club.
Being in the club means
being stirred up by things.
You look about as stirred up
as a cesspool.
- So you want me out?
- No, I want you in.
But being in means
you gotta do something,
not just say you're in.
Well, listen, Neil.
I appreciate this concern,
but I'm not like you, all right?
You say things and people listen.
- I'm not like that.
- Don't you think you could be?
No. I...
I don't know, but that's not the point.
The point is that there's nothing
you can do about it.
So you can just butt out.
I can take care of myself just fine.
All right?
No.
What do you mean, no?
No.
- Give me... Neil, give that back.
- What is this? "We are dreaming of a..."
What it this? Poetry.
I'm being chased by Walt Whitman.
Okay, okay.
What are you guys doing?
I'm trying... You see this chemistry...?
Hey, give me... Neil, give me...
Don't be immature.
Come on, I need my...
Give it to me. Give it to me.
Charlie, help me.
Grab that book. I need...
Whoo.
Whoo!
Okay, everybody on the bus.
Let's go, boys.
Come on, let's go.
On the bus, boys, now.
Now, devotees may argue
that one sport or game
is inherently better than another.
For me,
sport is actually a chance for us
to have other human beings
push us to excel.
I want you all to come over here
and take a slip of paper
and line up single file.
Mr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth.
Mr. Pitts, rise above your name.
I want you to hand these out to the boys,
one apiece.
You know what to do, Pitts.
O to struggle against great odds
To meet enemies undaunted.
Sounds to me like you're
daunted. Say it like you're undaunted.
O to struggle against great odds
To meet enemies undaunted.
Now, go on.
Yes. Next.
To be a sailor of the world
Bound for all ports.
Next. Louder.
O while I live to be the ruler of life
Not a slave.
To mount the scaffolds
To advance to the muzzles of guns
With perfect nonchalance!
Come on, Meeks. Listen to the music.
To dance, clap hands, exult
Shout, skip, roll on, float on!
Yes.
O to have life henceforth
A poem of new joys
Aw, pbbt. Boo.
Come on, Charlie, let it fill your soul.
To indeed be a god.
Charlie, I got the part. Rah!
I'm gonna play Puck.
I'm gonna play Puck.
- What did he say?
- Puck?
- The main part.
- Great, Neil.
Charlie, I got it.
- Congratulations.
- Good for you, Neil. Good for you.
Okay, okay, okay.
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
They need a letter of permission
from my father and Mr. Nolan.
- You're not gonna write it.
- Oh, yes, I am.
Oh, Neil, you're crazy.
Okay.
"I am writing to you
on behalf of my son,
Neil Perry."
This is great.
- "To Chris."
- Who's Chris?
Mmm. Chris.
I see a sweetness in her smile.
Bright light shines from her eyes.
But life is complete
Contentment is mine
Just knowing that...
Just knowing that
She's alive.
- Sorry, captain, it's stupid.
- No, no, it's not stupid.
It's a good effort.
It touched on
one of the major themes: Love.
A major theme not only in poetry,
but life.
Mr. Hopkins, you were laughing.
You're up.
The cat sat on the mat.
Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins.
You have the first poem to ever have
a negative score on the Pritchard scale.
We're not laughing at you,
we're laughing near you.
I don't mind that your poem
had a simple theme.
The most beautiful poetry
can be about simple things
like a cat, or a flower, or rain.
You see, poetry can come from anything
with the stuff of revelation in it.
Just don't let your poems be ordinary.
Now, who's next?
Mr. Anderson,
I see you sitting there in agony.
Come on, Todd, step up.
Let's put you out of your misery.
I didn't do it. I didn't write a poem.
Mr. Anderson thinks
that everything inside of him
is worthless and embarrassing.
Isn't that right, Todd?
Isn't that your worst fear?
Well, I think you're wrong.
I think you have something inside of you
that is worth a great deal.
"I sound
my barbaric
yawk
"over the rooftops of the world."
W.W., Uncle Walt again.
Now, for those of you who don't know,
a yawp is a loud cry or yell.
Now, Todd, I would like you to give us
a demonstration of a barbaric yawp.
Come on, you can't yawp sitting down.
Let's go. Come on, up.
Gotta get in yawping stance.
- A yawp.
- No, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp.
Yeah, yeah, right.
- Yawp.
- Come on, louder.
- Yawp.
- Oh, that's a mouse.
- Come on, louder.
- Yawp.
- God, boy, yell like a man.
- Yawp!
There it is. You see,
you have a barbarian in you after all.
Now, you don't get away that easy.
There's a picture of Uncle Walt up there.
What does he remind you of?
Don't think, answer. Go on.
- A madman.
- What kind of madman?
- Don't think about it, answer again.
- A crazy madman.
You can do better.
Free up your mind, use your imagination.
Say the first thing that pops into
your head, even if it's gibberish.
A sweaty-toothed madman.
Good God, boy,
there's a poet in you after all.
There, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, close them.
Now describe what you see.
- I close my eyes.
- Yes?
- And this image floats beside me.
- A sweaty-toothed madman.
A sweaty-toothed madman
with a stare that pounds my brain.
Oh, that's excellent. Now give him action.
Make him do something.
- His hands reach out and choke me.
- That's it. Wonderful, wonderful.
- And all the time he's mumbling.
- What's he mumbling?
Mumbling truth. Truth, like a blanket
that always leaves your feet cold.
Forget them, forget them.
Stay with the blanket.
Tell me about that blanket.
You can push it, stretch it,
it'll never be enough.
You kick at it, beat it,
it'll never cover any of us.
From the moment we enter crying
to the moment we leave dying,
it'll just cover your face
as you wail and cry and scream.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Don't you forget this.
- Atta boy, Pittsie, inhale deeply.
- My dad collects a lot of pipes.
- Really? Mine's got 30.
- Your parents collect pipes?
Oh, that's really interesting.
Come on, Knox. Join in.
We're from the government.
We're here to help.
- What's wrong?
- It's Chris.
- Here's a picture of Chris for you.
- Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
- That's not funny.
- Knock it off.
- Smoke your pipes.
- Okay.
Neil.
Friends, scholars, Welton men.
- What is that, Neil?
- Duh. It's a lamp, Meeks.
No, this is the god of the cave.
The god of the cave?
Charlie, what are you doing?
What do you say we start this meeting?
Yeah, just... I need a light.
- Who's got a light?
- Did you bring the earplugs?
Gentlemen, "Poetrusic,"
by Charles Dalton.
- Oh, boy.
- He's gonna play.
Oh, no.
Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling.
Gotta do more. Gotta be more.
Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming
Gotta do more, gotta be more.
Wow.
- That was nice.
- That was great.
Where did you learn to play like that?
My parents made me take the clarinet
for years.
- I love the clarinet.
- I hated it.
The saxophone.
The saxophone is more sonorous.
Ooh.
- Vocabulary.
- Look at him.
I can't take it anymore. If I don't
have Chris, I'm gonna kill myself.
Knoxious, you've gotta calm down.
No, Charlie.
That's just my problem.
I've been calm all my life.
- I'm gonna do something about that.
- Where you going?
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna call her. Yeah.
Hello?
She's gonna hate me.
The Danburrys will hate me.
My parents will kill me.
All right, goddamn it.
You're right. Carpe diem.
Even if it kills me.
- Hello?
- Hello, Chris?
- Yes?
- Hi, this is Knox Overstreet.
Oh, yes, Knox. Glad you called.
She's glad I called.
Listen, Chet's parents
are going out of town this weekend
and he's having a party.
- Would you like to come?
- Would I like to come to a party?
- Yes. Say yes.
- Friday?
- Well, sure.
- About 7?
- Okay, great. I'll be there, Chris.
- Okay.
Friday night at the Danburrys.
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay, bye.
Thank you. I'll see you. Bye.
Yawp!
Can you believe it?
She was gonna call me.
She invited me to a party with her.
- At Chet Danburry's house?
- Yeah.
- Well?
- So?
So you don't really think
she means you're going with her?
Well, of course not, Charlie,
but that's not the point.
- That's not the point at all.
- What is the point?
The point, Charlie,
is, uh...
- Yeah?
that she was thinking about me.
I've only met her once, and already,
she's thinking about me.
Damn it. It's gonna happen, guys.
I feel it.
She is going to be mine.
Carpe. Carpe.
No grades at stake, gentlemen.
Just take a stroll.
There it is.
I don't know, but I've been told
I don't know, but I've been told
Doing poetry is old
Doing poetry is old
Left, left, left, right, left.
Left, halt.
Thank you, gentlemen.
If you noticed, everyone started off
with their own stride, their own pace.
Mr. Pitts, taking his time.
He knew he'll get there one day.
Mr. Cameron,
you could see him thinking,
"Is this right? It might be right.
I know that... Maybe not. I don't know."
Mr. Overstreet's, driven by deeper force.
Yes, we know that.
All right, now, I didn't bring them up here
to ridicule them.
I brought them up here
to illustrate the point of conformity.
The difficulty in maintaining
your own beliefs in the face of others.
Now, those of you,
I see the look in your eyes like,
"I would have walked differently."
Well, ask yourselves
why you were clapping.
Now, we all have a great need
for acceptance.
But you must trust
that your beliefs are unique, your own.
Even though others
may think them odd or unpopular.
Even though the herd may go,
"That's baa-d."
Robert Frost said,
"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
I took the one less travelled by,
and that has made all the difference."
Now, I want you to find your own walk
right now.
Your own way of striding, pacing.
Any direction, anything you want.
Whether it's proud,
whether it's silly, anything.
Gentlemen, the courtyard is yours.
You don't have to perform,
just make it for yourself.
Mr. Dalton, you be joining us?
Exercising the right not to walk.
Thank you, Mr. Dalton.
You just illustrated the point.
Swim against the stream.
Todd?
- Hey.
- Hey.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
- Today's my birthday.
- Is today your birthday?
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.
- What'd you get?
- My parents gave me this.
Isn't this the same desk...?
Yeah, they gave me the same thing
as last year.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Maybe they thought
you needed another one.
Maybe they weren't thinking
about anything at all.
The funny thing is about this is,
I didn't even like it the first time.
Todd, I think you're underestimating
the value of this desk set.
I mean, who would want a football,
or a baseball, or...?
Or a car?
Or a car, if they could have a desk set
as wonderful as this one?
I mean, if I were ever going to buy
a desk set twice,
I would probably buy this one
both times.
In fact, its shape is...
It's rather aerodynamic, isn't it?
I can feel it.
Phew.
This desk set wants to fly.
Todd?
The world's first unmanned
flying desk set.
Whew. Ha, ha.
Oh, my.
Well, I wouldn't worry.
You'll get another one next year.
To live deep
And suck out all the marrow of life.
To put to rout all that was not life.
Oh, my God.
- Is this it?
- Yeah, this is it.
Go ahead, go on in. It's my cave.
- Watch your step.
- We're not gonna slip, are we?
Uh-oh.
Hi.
- Unh.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hi, guys.
Meet, uh, Gloria and...
- Tina.
- Tina.
This is the pledge class
of the Dead Poets Society.
- Hello.
- Hey, how do you do?
- Hello.
- Hi.
Guys, move, move.
Come on, folks, it's Friday night.
Let's get on with the meeting.
Excuse me.
CHRIS Hello?
In keeping with the spirit of passionate
experimentation of the Dead Poets,
I'm giving up the name Charles Dalton.
From now on, call me Nuwanda.
- Nuwanda?
- Nuwanda?
Okay.
Hello? Hello, Chris?
- Knox.
- Hi.
You made it, great.
- Bring anybody?
- No.
No? Ginny Danburry's here.
Look, I have to go find Chet.
Why don't you go downstairs?
That's where everybody is.
- But, Chris...
- Make yourself at home.
But I...
Hey, guys.
Hey, you Mutt Sanders' brother?
Bubba, this guy look like
Mutt Sanders to you, or what?
You're his brother?
No relation. Never heard of him.
Sorry, guys.
Where's your manners?
There's Mutt Sanders' brother,
we don't even offer him a drink.
- Have some whisky, pal.
- Yeah.
I don't really drink...
- To Mutt.
- To Mutt.
To Mutt.
Now, how the hell is old Mutt anyway?
Yeah, what's old Mutter
been up to, huh?
I don't really know Mutt.
- To the Mighty Mutt.
- To Mighty Mutt.
To Mighty Mutt.
Well, listen, I gotta go find Patsy.
Say hello to Mutt for me, okay?
- Will do.
- Hell of a guy, your old brother, Mutt.
Are we gonna have a meeting, or what?
Yeah, if you guys don't have a meeting,
how do we know if we want to join?
Join?
Shall I compare thee
To a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely
And more temperate.
- That's so sweet.
- I made that up just for you.
You did?
I'll write one for you too, Gloria.
She walks in beauty like the night
She walks in beauty like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies
All that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
That's beautiful.
There's plenty more
where that came from.
God help me.
Carpe diem.
What, you don't remember?
What, are you kidding?
- Chet, Chet, look.
- What?
It's Mutt Sanders' brother.
Huh?
- Knox...?
- He's feeling up your girl.
What are you doing?
- What the hell are you doing?
- Chet.
- Chet, don't.
- Chet, I know this looks bad, but...
- Ahh!
- Chet, no, you'll hurt him.
No, Chet, stop it.
- Jesus.
- Leave him alone.
- Goddamn.
- Chet, stop it.
Bastard.
- Knox, are you all right?
- Chris, get the hell away from him.
- Chet, you hurt him.
- Good.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.
Next time I see you, you die.
Go ahead, pass it around.
Me and Pitts
are working on a hi-fi system.
It shouldn't be that hard to put together.
Yeah, I might be going to Yale.
But I might not.
Don't you guys
miss having girls around here?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
That's part of what this club is about.
In fact, I'd like to announce
I published an article in the school paper
in the name of the Dead Poets.
What?
- Demanding girls be admitted to Welton.
- You didn't.
- So we can all stop beating off.
- How did you do that?
I'm one of the proofers.
I slipped the article in.
- Look, it's over now.
- Why? Nobody knows who we are.
Don't you think
they're gonna figure out who wrote it?
They're gonna come to you and ask
to know what the Dead Poets Society is.
Charlie, you had no right
to do something like that.
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
And are we just playing around out there,
or do we mean what we say?
If all we do is come together
and read a bunch of poems to each other,
what the hell are we doing?
All right, but you still
shouldn't have done it, Charlie.
This could mean trouble.
You don't speak for the club.
Hey, would you not worry
about your precious little neck?
If they catch me,
I'll tell them I made it up.
Fine.
Sit.
This week's issue of Welton Honor,
there appeared a profane
and unauthorized article.
Rather than spend my valuable time
ferreting out the guilty persons...
And let me assure you, I will find them.
I'm asking any and all students
who know anything about this article
to make themselves known
here and now.
Whoever the guilty persons are,
this is your only chance
to avoid expulsion from this school.
Welton Academy, hello?
Yes, he is. Just a moment.
Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
It's God.
He says we should have girls at Welton.
Wipe that smirk off your face.
If you think, Mr. Dalton,
that you're the first
to try to get thrown out of this school,
think again.
Others have had similar notions
and have failed
just as surely as you will fail.
Assume the position.
Count aloud, Mr. Dalton.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
What is this Dead Poets Society?
I want names.
- You kicked out?
- No.
So, what happened?
I'm to turn everybody in,
apologize to the school,
and all will be forgiven.
So, what are you gonna do?
- Charlie.
- Damn it, Neil.
The name is Nuwanda.
Excuse me.
- May we have a word, Mr. Keating?
- Certainly.
This was my first classroom, John.
Did you know that?
- My first desk.
- I didn't know you taught, Mr. Nolan.
English.
Long before your time.
It was hard giving it up, I can tell you.
I'm hearing rumors, John,
about some unorthodox teaching methods,
in your classroom.
I'm not saying they've had anything to do
with the Dalton boy's outburst,
but I don't think I have to warn you,
boys his age are very impressionable.
Well, your reprimand
made quite an impression, I'm sure.
What was going on in the courtyard
the other day?
Courtyard?
Yeah, boys marching,
clapping in unison.
Oh, that.
That was an exercise to prove a point.
Dangers of conformity.
Well, John, the curriculum here is set.
It's proven, it works.
If you question it, what's to prevent them
from doing the same?
I thought the idea of education
was to learn to think for yourself.
At these boys' age? Not on your life.
Tradition, John. Discipline.
Prepare them for college
and the rest will take care of itself.
Creak.
He starts walking around
towards my left. Creak.
Creak.
"Assume the position, Mr. Dalton."
It's all right, gentlemen.
- Mr. Keating.
- Mr. Dalton.
That was a pretty lame stunt
you pulled today.
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?
What about carpe diem,
sucking all the marrow out of life...?
Sucking the marrow out of life
doesn't mean choking on the bone.
Sure, there's a time for daring,
and there's a time for caution.
And a wise man understands
which is called for.
- But I thought you'd like that.
- No.
You being expelled from school
is not daring to me, it's stupid.
Because you'll miss
some golden opportunities.
Yeah, like what?
Like if nothing else,
the opportunity to attend my classes.
Got it, Ace?
Aye, aye, captain.
Keep your head about you.
That goes for the lot of you.
- Yes, captain.
- Yes, captain.
Phone call from God.
If it had been collect,
it would have been daring.
All right. Go on, play.
We're trying to rehearse, okay?
A good persuasion.
Therefore, hear me, Hermia.
Wait please. Excitement.
I don't hear any excitement about this play.
And take her hand.
Bring her down the stage and stop, and,
"There, gentle Hermia." Try again.
- What's for dinner?
- Spaghetti and meatballs.
Save some for me.
But, room, fairy! Here comes Oberon.
- Father.
- Neil.
- Before you say anything, please let me...
- Don't you dare talk back to me.
It's bad enough
that you've wasted your time
with this absurd acting business.
But you deliberately deceived me.
How did you expect
to get away with this?
Answer me.
Who put you up to it? Was it
this new man, this, uh, Mr. Keating?
No, nobody...
I thought I'd surprise you.
- I've gotten all A's in every class.
- So did you think I wasn't gonna find out?
"Oh, my niece is in a play with your son,"
says Mrs. marks.
"No, no, no," I say.
"You must be mistaken.
My son's not in a play."
You made a liar out of me, Neil.
Now, tomorrow, you go to them
and you tell them that you're quitting.
No, I can't. I have the main part.
The performance is tomorrow night.
I don't care if the world comes to an end
tomorrow. You are through with that play.
Is that clear?
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
I made a great many sacrifices
to get you here, Neil.
And you will not let me down.
No, sir.
It's open.
Neil, what's up?
- Can I speak to you a minute?
- Certainly. Sit down.
- I'm sorry, here.
- Excuse me.
- Get you some tea?
- Tea, sure.
- Like some milk or sugar in that?
- No, thanks.
Gosh, they don't give you much room
around here.
No, it's part of the monastic oath.
They don't want worldly things
distracting me from my teaching.
- She's pretty.
- She's also in London.
Makes it a little difficult.
- How can you stand it?
- Stand what?
You can go anywhere.
You can do anything.
- How can you stand being here?
- Because I love teaching.
I don't want to be anywhere else.
What's up?
I just talked to my father.
He's making me quit the play
at Henley Hall.
Acting's everything to me. I...
But he doesn't know, he...
I can see his point.
We're not a rich family like Charlie's.
And we...
But he's planning the rest of my life
for me,
and he's never asked me what I want.
Have you ever told your father
what you just told me?
About your passion for acting.
You ever show him that?
- I can't.
- Why not?
- I can't talk to him this way.
- Then you're acting for him too.
You're playing the part of the dutiful son.
I know this sounds impossible,
but you have to talk to him.
Show him who you are,
what your heart is.
I know what he'll say.
He'll tell me that acting's a whim
and I should forget it.
That they're counting on me.
He'll just tell me to put it out of my mind
for my own good.
You are not an indentured servant.
If it's not a whim for you,
you prove it to him
by your conviction and your passion.
You show him that,
and if he still doesn't believe you,
well, by then, you'll be out of school
and you can do anything you want.
No.
What about the play?
The show's tomorrow night.
Then you have to talk to him
before tomorrow night.
I...
- Isn't there an easier way?
- No.
I'm trapped.
No, you're not.
I need my notebook.
I'll see you later, Brian.
Chris.
Hey, Chris.
- Chris Noel, do you know where she is?
- I think she's in Room 111.
Thanks.
I know.
Oh, no.
- Excuse me. Chris.
- Knox, what are you doing here?
I came to apologize for the other night.
I brought you these
and a poem I wrote for you.
Knox, don't you know
that if Chet finds you here, he'll kill you?
I don't care.
- I love you, Chris.
- Knox, you're crazy.
- Look, I acted like a jerk, and I know it.
- Hey.
- Please accept these. Please?
- No, I... I can't.
Just forget it.
- Knox, I don't believe this.
- All I'm asking you to do is listen.
The heavens made a girl named Chris
With hair and skin of gold
To touch her would be paradise
- Uhh.
- Get out of here.
Cameron, you fool.
- Hey, how'd it go? Did you read it to her?
- Yeah.
- What'd she say?
- Nothing.
Nothing? What do you mean, nothing?
Nothing. But I did it.
What did she say?
She had to say something.
- Come here, Knox.
- Seize the day. Whoo-hoo-hoo.
- Did you talk to your father?
- Uh, yeah.
He didn't like it one bit,
but at least he's letting me
stay in the play.
He won't be able make it.
He's in Chicago.
But I think he's gonna let me stay
with acting.
Really? You told him what you told me?
Yeah.
He wasn't happy.
But he'll be gone at least four days.
I don't think he'll make the show,
but I think he'll let me stay with it.
Keep up the school work.
Thanks.
- Baby.
- Beautiful baby.
- Henley Hall, here I come.
- Excuse me, just a moment.
Yes, you.
Come on, Todd, I'm trying to fix this.
Come on, Nuwanda,
we're gonna miss Neil's entrance.
He said something about getting red
before we left.
Getting red? What does that mean?
I... Well, you know Charlie.
So, Charlie, what's this "getting red" bit?
What is that?
It's an Indian warrior symbol for virility.
Makes me feel potent.
Like it can drive girls crazy.
Oh, come on, Charlie.
The girls are waiting.
- Henley Hall.
- Whoa.
Chris.
- What are you doing here?
- Gentlemen, let's go.
- Go ahead, guys, I'll catch up.
- Yeah, come on, guys.
Chris, you can't be in here.
If they catch you,
we're gonna be in trouble.
- Come on.
- Oh, but it's fine...
Chris.
It's fine for you to come into my school
and make a complete fool out of me?
- I didn't mean to make a fool out of you.
- Well, you did.
Chet found out,
and it took everything I could do
to keep him from coming here
and killing you.
Knox, you have got to stop this stuff.
I can't, Chris. I love you.
Knox, you say that over and over.
You don't even know me.
Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet?
Go ahead, captain. I'll walk.
Knox. Knox, if it just so happens
that I could care less about you...
Then you wouldn't be here
warning me about Chet.
I have to go.
I'm gonna be late for the play.
- Are you going with him?
- Chet, to a play? Are you kidding?
- Then come with me.
- Knox, you are so infuriating.
Come on, Chris,
just give me one chance.
If you don't like me after tonight,
I'll stay away forever.
- Uh-huh.
- I promise. Dead Poets' honor.
You come with me tonight,
then if you don't want to see me again,
I swear, I'll bow out.
You know what would happen
if Chet found out?
He won't know anything.
We'll sit in the back and sneak away
as soon as it's over.
And I suppose you would promise
that this would be the end of it.
Dead Poets' honor.
What is that?
My word.
You are so infuriating.
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Shh. Boys.
Either I mistake your shape
or making quite,
Or else you are that shrewd
and knavish sprite
Called Robin Goodfellow.
Thou speak'st aright;
I am that merry wanderer of the night.
I jest to Oberon and make him smile
When I a fat
and bean-fed horse, pbbt, beguile,
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal.
Sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
In very likeness of a roasted crab,
And when she drink,
against her lips I bob
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
He's good. He's really good.
Sometime for three-foot stool
mistaketh me;
Then slip I from her bum,
down topples she,
And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
And then the whole quire
hold their hips and laugh,
And waxen in their mirth
and neeze and swear
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
But, room, fairy! Here comes Oberon.
And here my mistress.
Would that he were gone!
Then by your side
no bed-room me deny;
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
Lysander riddles very prettily:
Now much beshrew
my manners and my pride,
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
Lie further off; In human modesty,
Such separation as many well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
and, good night, sweet friend:
Thy love ne'er alter
till thy sweet life end!
Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;
Neil. That's your cue, Neil.
Come on, Neil.
Here's your crown. Let's go.
If we shadows have offended,
Think but this, and all is mended,
That you have but slumber'd here
While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,
Gentles, do not reprehend:
If you pardon, we will mend:
And, as I am an honest Puck,
If we have unearned luck
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
We will make amends ere long;
Else the Puck a liar call;
So, good night unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.
Yeah!
Yeah, Neil.
Great job, Neil.
Great show, everyone.
Excuse me, I'm Neil's father.
I need to see him.
Your father, he's...
What did you think of it?
Really, I thought
you were all just wonderful.
Excuse me, please. Excuse me.
- Excuse me, please.
- Neil. Neil.
- Neil.
- We love you, wait.
- I can't, guys.
- Neil.
- Neil.
- Excuse me.
Neil. Neil. You have the gift.
What a performance.
You left even me speechless.
- You have to stay...
- Get in the car.
Keating, you stay away from my son.
Neil. Neil. Mr. Perry, come on.
Don't make it any worse than it is.
Is it okay if we walk back?
Captain?
Knox.
- We'll be home about 11:30 still.
- I know where he gets it.
Ahem. We're trying very hard to understand
why it is that you insist on defying us.
Whatever the reason,
we're not gonna let you ruin your life.
Tomorrow I'm withdrawing you
from Welton
and enrolling you
in Braden Military School.
You're going to Harvard
and you're gonna be a doctor.
But that's 10 more years.
- Father, that's a lifetime.
- Oh, stop it.
Don't be so dramatic.
You make it sound like a prison term.
You don't understand, Neil.
You have opportunities
that I never even dreamt of.
- I am not going to let you waste them.
- I've got to tell you what I feel.
- We've been so worried about...
- What? What? Tell me what you feel.
What is it?
Is it more of this...?
This acting business?
Because you can forget that.
What?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Well, then, let's go to bed.
I was good.
I was really good.
Go on, get some sleep.
It's all right. It's going to be all right.
- What was that?
- What?
- That sound.
- What sound?
Tom?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Neil?
Tom, what is it?
What's wrong?
Neil?
- Neil?
- I'll look outside.
Neil?
No!
Oh, Neil!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no. He's all right.
- Oh, my son. My son, my poor son.
- He's all right. He's all right. He's all right.
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it.
Todd?
- Todd.
- Oh, Charlie.
What is it?
Neil's dead.
It's so beautiful.
Todd. It's okay, Todd.
- Calm down.
- It's all right, Todd.
Todd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd.
It's all right.
- Now, listen.
- He wouldn't have done it.
- You can't explain it.
- It was his father.
- No.
- He wouldn't have left us.
He wouldn't have. His dad was...
- Todd.
- His father did it.
- His father killed him.
- You can't explain it, Todd.
- Todd.
- Leave him be.
Neil!
The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy.
He was a fine student.
One of Welton's best.
And he will be missed.
We've contacted each of your parents
to explain the situation.
Naturally, they're all quite concerned.
At the request of Neil's family,
I intend to conduct a thorough enquiry
into this matter.
Your complete cooperation is expected.
- You told him about this meeting?
- Twice.
That's it, guys. We're all fried.
- How do you mean?
- Cameron's a fink.
- He's in Nolan's office right now, finking.
- About what?
The club, Pittsie. Think about it.
The board of directors,
the trustees and Mr. Nolan.
Do you think for one moment
they're gonna let this thing just blow over?
Schools go down
because of things like this.
They need a scapegoat.
What's going on, guys?
You finked, didn't you, Cameron?
Finked? I don't know
what you're talking about.
You told Nolan everything about the club
is what I'm talking about.
Look, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton,
there's something called an honor code
at this school, all right?
If a teacher asks you a question,
you tell the truth or you're expelled.
- You little punk.
- Charlie.
He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes,
so he ratted to save himself.
Don't touch him. You do and you're out.
- I'm out anyway.
- You don't know that, not yet.
He's right there, Charlie.
And if you guys are smart, you will do
exactly what I did and cooperate.
They're not after us. We're the victims.
Us and Neil.
What's that mean? Who are they after?
Why, Mr. Keating, of course.
The "captain" himself.
I mean, you guys didn't really think
he could avoid responsibility, did you?
Mr. Keating responsible for Neil?
- Is that what they're saying?
- Well, who else do you think, dumb-ass?
The administration? Mr. Perry?
Mr. Keating put us up to all this crap,
didn't he?
If it wasn't for Mr. Keating, Neil would be
cozied up in his room right now
studying his chemistry
and dreaming of being...
That is not true, Cameron.
You know that.
He didn't put us up to anything.
Neil loved acting.
Believe what you want,
but I say let Keating fry.
I mean, why ruin our lives?
Charlie.
- You dummy.
- Charlie.
You just signed your expulsion papers,
Nuwanda.
And if the rest of you are smart,
you'll do exactly what I did.
They know everything anyway.
You can't save Keating,
but you can save yourselves.
Knox Overstreet.
- Meeks.
- Go away, I have to study.
- What happened to Nuwanda?
- Expelled.
What'd you tell them?
Nothing they didn't already know.
Todd Anderson.
- Hello, son.
- Hello, darling.
Mom.
Have a seat, Mr. Anderson.
Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well
put together what's happened here.
You do admit to being a part
of this Dead Poets Society?
Answer him, Todd.
Yes, sir.
I have here a detailed description
of what occurred at your meetings.
It describes how your teacher,
Mr. Keating,
encouraged you boys
to organize this club
and to use it as a source of inspiration
for reckless and self-indulgent behavior.
It describes how Mr. Keating,
both in and out of the classroom,
encouraged Neil Perry
to follow his obsession with acting
when he knew all along it was against
the explicit orders of Neil's parents.
It was Mr. Keating's blatant abuse
of his position as teacher
that led directly to Neil Perry's death.
Read that document carefully, Todd.
Very carefully.
If you've nothing to add or amend,
sign it.
What's gonna happen to Mr. Keating?
I've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd.
McAllister: Grass is garment or herbal.
Lapis is stone.
The entire building is aedificium.
Sit.
I'll be teaching this class
through exams.
We'll find a permanent English teacher
during the break.
Who will tell me where you are
in the Pritchard textbook?
Mr. Anderson.
- In the... In the Pr...
- I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson.
In the Pritchard?
Kindly inform me, Mr. Cameron.
We skipped around a lot, sir.
We covered the romantics
and some of the chapters
on post Civil War literature.
What about the realists?
I believe we skipped most of that, sir.
All right, then, we'll start over.
What is poetry?
Come.
Excuse me.
I came for my personals.
- Should I come back after class?
- Get them now, Mr. Keating.
Gentlemen, turn to page of the introduction.
Mr. Cameron,
read aloud the excellent essay
by Dr. Pritchard
on "Understanding Poetry."
That page has been ripped out, sir.
- Well, borrow somebody else's book.
- They're all ripped out, sir.
What do you mean,
they're all ripped out?
- Sir, we...
- Never mind.
Read.
"Understanding Poetry,
by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D."
To fully understand poetry,
we must first be fluent with its meter,
rhyme and figures of speech,
then ask two questions.
One: How artfully has the objective
of the poem been rendered?
And two:
How important is that objective?
Question one rates the poem's perfection.
Question two rates its importance.
And once these questions
have been answered,
determining the poem's greatness
becomes a relatively simple matter.
"If the poem's score for perfection
is plotted on the horizontal of a graph..."
- Mr. Keating, they made everybody sign it.
- Quiet.
You gotta believe me, it's true.
- I do believe you, Todd.
- Leave, Mr. Keating.
- But it wasn't his fault.
- Sit down.
One more outburst from you
or anyone else,
and you're out of this school.
Leave, Mr. Keating.
I said leave, Mr. Keating.
O Captain! My Captain!
Sit down, Mr. Anderson.
Do you hear me? Sit down.
Sit down.
This is your final warning, Anderson.
How dare you?
Do you hear me?
O Captain! My Captain!
Mr. Overstreet, I warn you. Sit down.
Sit down.
Sit down. All of you.
I want you seated. Sit down.
Leave, Mr. Keating.
All of you, down. I want you seated.
Do you hear me?
Sit down.
Thank you, boys.
Thank you.

I wish I were a man,
to swim naked in the river.
How brave.
The things you say, Rosita.
Yeah, and have the water running
all over your thingy, how nice!
Yeah, that's right.
Before you jump in the water,
take the boy off me.
He's breaking my back.
- I'm sorry.
- Come, Salvador, come here.
Let's see.
Look, here's a stick for you to play.
- Okay.
- All right.
- Mari, help me with the sheets.
- Coming.
The little soapy fish.
Look! There they are.
The little soapy fish.
Sing a song for us, Rosita.
How beautiful.
- By your side
- Look how beautiful they are.
By your side
Always by your little side
Always by your little side
Until from pain I die
I couldn't look into your eyes
I couldn't knock at your door
Salvita, don't move from there, okay?
I couldn't step at night
On the cobblestones of your alley
By your side
Always by your little side
Always by your little side
Until of love I die
Look, they say and say
Look at that afternoon
Look how it went and came
From his house to the poplar grove
And that way, looking and looking
Come on, girl.
That's how my blindness
Started
Salva.
It's Zulema.
What a surprise!
- Darling.
- I'm so happy to see you.
Can you have a coffee with me,
or are you in a hurry?
What will you do if
you don't write or film?
- Live, I guess.
- I can't live without acting.
It's getting more difficult,
but I take everything they offer me.
Do you see Alberto?
- I think he was in Argentina.
- No, no, in Mexico.
He was working on some soap operas,
but he's back now.
I bumped into him at a Latin film festival
on the Riviera Maya.
He was lovely. It was some time ago,
but it was a very, very nice meeting.
Have you seen him?
No, no. I haven't seen him
since the premiere of Flavor.
But that was... 30 years ago.
Thirty-two.
You know, I saw the movie again last week.
- You hadn't watched it again?
- No, not since the premiere.
And it's wrong to say this,
but it moved me.
I've always loved it.
No, the cinematheque restored the negative,
and they're going to hold some screenings.
They asked me to present it, and I thought
it would be good to do it with Alberto.
I'm glad you're not holding a grudge.
The bastard never did
the character I wrote.
I wanted to kill him.
But... I don't really hold grudges.
Having seen the movie again,
his acting is better now than 30 years ago.
It's your eyes that changed, honey.
It's the same movie.
Do you know how to find him?
He lives in El Escorial.
Yeah, at somebody's house.
He works once in a while,
but he looks good, without giving up...
Well, you know what I mean.
I'm surprised it's you who's not working.
I always thought you'd be
the one to never retire.
Same here.
- Do you still have the same number?
- Yeah.
I'll send you his contact info,
and I'll send mine too,
in case you ever get bored
and write something only I can do.
Here we are.
I leave you with Father JosÃ© MarÃ­a.
Good morning, boys.
The first thing we're going to do is choose
the members of the chorus.
Has anybody sung in a chorus before?
Raise your hand.
Okay, we're going to have a test.
You, come here. Yes, you.
- What's your name?
- Rodolfo.
Rodolfo, let's check out your vocalization.
Repeat after me.
You, next to him.
What's your name?
- Salvador.
- Beautiful name. Do you like to sing?
- I don't know.
- But you like music, right?
Yes, I like The Beatles and movies.
Well, here we will broaden and direct
your tastes towards less pagan subjects.
Let's do a vocalization test.
Let's warm up those voices, boys.
That's how I became the chorus soloist.
The priests decided that I shouldn't go
to geography and history classes,
or science and art history.
The first three years of high school,
I rehearsed during the hours
of those classes
and I always passed.
They made me into a complete ignoramus
who passed every class
without actually taking the exams.
GEOGRAPHY
Eventually, I became a film director.
And I started to learn Spanish geography
by traveling to promote
the films I directed.
I traveled because I was successful.
My knowledge of geography matched
the expansion of my career.
ANATOMY
I started to know my body
through pain and illness.
I lived my first 30 years
pretty much in the dark,
but soon I discovered that my head
and what was inside it,
besides being a source
of pleasure and knowledge,
held infinite possibilities for pain.
Soon I found insomnia,
chronic pharyngitis, otitis, acid reflux,
ulcers, and intrinsic asthma.
Nerves in general
and the sciatic nerve in particular.
And all kinds of muscular pain:
Lumbar, dorsal, tendinitis,
both knees and shoulders.
This is tinnitus.
I have it too.
This is wheezing.
I also suffer from this.
Besides tinnitus and wheezing,
headaches are my specialty.
Migraines, tension or cluster headaches,
and back pain.
From my lumbar spinal-fusion surgery,
which immobilized more
than half of my back,
I found that my life would revolve around
the spinal column.
I became aware of each one of the vertebrae
and the amount of muscles and ligaments
that make up the mythology of our body.
And just like the Greek gods,
the only way we can relate
is through sacrifice.
But not all is as physical
and illustratable.
I also suffer from abstract sorrows.
Aches of the soul, like panic and anxiety,
that add angst and horror to my life.
And of course,
I have toggled with depression for years.
On the nights where several aches coincide,
those nights I believe in God.
And I pray.
On the days that I only have
one kind of pain,
I'm an atheist.
It's here, it's here.
All right.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.
- Bye, thank you.
- Good day.
Who is it?
Alberto, it's Salvador.
Salvador who?
Salvador Mallo.
What are you doing here?
I need to talk to you.
- About what?
- Flavor.
Can I come in?
Want something to drink?
Whatever you're having.
I was making some tea.
Okay, then.
Oh, look.
FLAVOR
I love the fact that you have Flavor here.
Why have you come?
It took me 32 years
to reconcile myself with this film.
Thirty-two years.
Beautiful.
What are those trees, firs?
Pine.
Are you gonna fucking tell me
why you came to see me after 32 years?
The cinematheque restored Flavor.
They decided it's a classic,
and they included it
in a series of movies shot in Madrid.
They called to ask
if we could present it together.
And they don't know we haven't talked
to each other since the shoot?
If they know, they didn't say anything.
Alberto,
gossip gets old, like people.
- Listen, do you mind if we sit down?
- No, no, sit down.
Thank you very much.
But why do you want
to present it together now?
Because you didn't present it
at the premiere.
Because you didn't let me, fag.
That's why I think it's fair that both
of us present it at the cinematheque.
Who gave you my address?
Zulema.
I bumped into her and we talked about you.
Listen, I'm gonna chase the dragon.
If it repulses you, you can go.
And we'll call each other
for the cinematheque thing.
Can I have some?
I don't recognize you, Salvador.
- What, it's your first time?
- Yeah.
And why do you want to try heroin now?
I'm curious.
You must be doing research for something.
The drop, the drop, the drop.
Salvador.
Salva.
Salva!
Come here and help me.
Mom, I found a novel.
Very good, put it there.
Grab this.
How the hell could I know
it was a holiday here?
It's not a holiday in our town.
I didn't know either.
What a night we're going to have, son.
How embarrassing.
Open the chocolate, Salvador.
Okay, Mom.
Mom, there are two trading cards.
Leave them, son. Come on, let's eat.
Liz Taylor and Robert Taylor.
Do you think they're brother and sister?
Well, I guess.
Eat.
Oh, what a shame, son.
We're here like gypsies.
I like the station.
You're so imaginative.
I don't know who you got that from.
Cover yourself, don't get sick.
Oh, my God, what's that tomato?
I hadn't seen that.
Give it to me. I'll stitch it.
Look, with the egg.
Move over there, go to sleep.
Did you know that your dad in the army...
learned how to sew
and mend and iron shirts?
He was very good at it.
Do you think I'll join the army?
I guess you'll have to, son.
I don't want to join the army.
And I don't want you to go. That's useless.
- Mom.
- Yes?
Do you think
Liz Taylor mends Robert Taylor's socks?
I don't know.
In the pictures,
she doesn't look like she likes sewing.
Are you okay?
Don't forget to breathe, eh?
No.
My God, what a long night.
I thought we were never gonna make it.
I told you to wait a few days
until I was settled in.
- Your mother was sick of us.
- Don't say that.
Oh, no? Do you know what she said
three days ago?
"This month's bread bill has skyrocketed."
Can you believe it?
Don't mind her, woman. You know how she is.
I won't be a burden on anyone.
That same day I packed our bags,
and here we are.
Salva! Salva, come here.
- Or do you prefer to be alone?
- Jacinta, please, don't say that.
I'm just saying,
you could've waited a few days.
- Is it much further?
- No.
We're here.
Our house is here?
We're on top of it.
What do you mean, on top?
On top.
- A cave?
- It's the best I could do.
- For christ sake, Venancio, a cave?
- Salva, come on, let's go.
But how are we going to live in a cave?!
There are more than 300 families living
in caves. It's typical of this village.
There's no shame in that.
Is this our house, Dad?
This is it, son. This is it.
A cave!
Oh, my God.
Leaving town and coming here was your idea.
What would they say if they saw us now?
I haven't had time to whitewash,
that's why I wanted you to wait a little.
Everything's a mess.
It still needs some fixing up.
Mom, look, the sky!
Look.
I cleaned up the best I could.
Are you happy we came?
Jacinta, I wanted something else for you.
You think I'm happy bringing you to a cave?
There wasn't anything else.
It's okay.
I'll fix it so it looks like a house.
Come on.
But your mother, really...
Complaining about the bread
in front of the kid.
Look, he loves it.
I don't want you to be so serious.
You look ugly.
Dad, can I sweep up?
No, I need a taxi to pick me up at...
One second.
- What's the address?
- 89 Ponton Street.
89 Ponton Street.
In San Lorenzo de El Escorial, yeah.
The destination is
108 Paseo del Pintor Rosales.
Yeah, Madrid. That's right.
Good, very good.
Fifteen minutes, fine, thanks.
- The cinematheque thing is clear, right?
- Yeah.
On the 18th. In three weeks.
- I'm already thinking about the outfit.
- Good.
But we'll talk before that, won't we?
- Okay.
- What are you doing?
Aren't we going to kiss
like old lady friends?
We even chased the dragon together.
Okay, okay.
Hello.
Mrs. Mercedes called
and said to call her when you can
- Hello.
- It's... It's me.
Salvador,
is it true about the cinematheque?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keep me updated. Don't ignore me so much.
I was gonna tell you.
I love that they're showing Flavor
and that you're going out.
But are you sure you want a Q&A?
- It'll be packed.
- No, I don't want a Q&A.
But I'm curious to see if the film
has survived these past 30 years.
Don't doubt it.
But if you decide not to go,
tell me and I'll fix it, okay?
It's better to cancel now
than at the last minute.
All right, bye.
I'm leaving, do you need anything?
- No, thanks, Maya, see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.
"I was the loneliest man
death has ever seen.
I entered the room where Johannes was.
He had turned around and curled up,
so there was no room for me.
When I tried to make some space,
he woke up and we made love.
But loneliness was with me
and I couldn't expel it from my heart.
We were as close as two people can be,
but each one in his own world."
Hi. Weren't you going to open the door?
I wasn't expecting anybody
and I have a headache.
- I can leave if you want me to.
- No, come in now that you're here.
Do you live like this?
- In the dark?
- When I have a headache, yes.
Poor guy. What a great house you have, man.
Want something to drink?
Any kind of alcohol.
Wonderful.
What...? What should I do? What...?
Breathe through your nose.
Through your nose.
Through your nose.
Wait, wait. Water.
Calm down. Here.
Wait. Breathe.
Drink.
Careful. Drink. Slowly, slowly, slowly.
Fuck! I choke on everything.
Fuck, it was scary.
I thought you were choking to death.
I'm okay. It happens every once in a while.
And it's horrible.
THE ADDICTION
"My idea of the movie theater was always
linked to the breeze of summer nights.
We only watched movies in the summer."
Movies were screened on
a huge whitewashed wall.
I remember especially
the movies with water.
Waterfalls, beaches,
the bottom of the ocean, rivers or springs.
Hearing the sound of the water
made us kids want to pee really bad.
And we would do it right there,
on both sides of the screen.
My childhood movie theater
always smells like pee.
And jasmine. And a summer breeze.
What are you doing there?
I'm reading you.
I just read "The Addiction."
Well, you shouldn't.
I had to do something. You were groggy.
May I?
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, delicious!
Hey, I loved the short story, man.
It's not a short story.
Okay, whatever it is.
It could be brought to the stage
just like it is.
- Thanks, but it's not a dramatic text.
- Doesn't matter.
I could interpret it.
I know very well what it's about.
You?
You're on the opposite side of that text.
You forget, I'm an actor.
And I'm very good at suffering.
Salvador, I need to act again.
I climbed down my pedestal
a long time ago.
Look, I'm in contact
with the Mirador Theater.
I know it's a very small theater,
very "off,"
to stage Cocteau's
Le Bel IndiffÃ©rent.
With men, to give it a twist.
But to tell you the truth,
I prefer your text by far.
Give me a copy
- and I'll give it to the director.
- Stop, stop.
I don't get it. Why'd you write it?
I wrote it to forget about it,
but I don't want to talk about that.
Would you mind giving me the rest of it?
Here.
I'm not a drug dealer, man. Here.
It's yours.
But manage it with discretion.
Because these late discoveries
are the worst. And you look like a killer.
Hey, think about what I told you
about the Mirador Theater.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Is your headache gone?
- Completely.
- See?
- That's right.
Think he's on his way?
I don't know. You handled this yourself.
I don't get it.
I showed him the restoration, he loved it.
- The bathroom?
- Yeah, on the left.
Why don't you call him?
- Is there gonna be a Q&A?
- Yes, yes, yes. The director's on his way.
All right.
The cinematheque.
Yeah, right, right.
I can't believe it, man.
You make such a big deal
and then you don't show up.
The trouble I went through
to borrow this jacket...
You go.
How can I go by myself?
- I don't want them to see me like this.
- How?
We're not going to a beauty pageant,
it's a fucking Q&A.
I don't want them to see me drugged
and hesitant.
Once you go on-stage, you get invigorated.
You've been great.
Hey, that was before.
And I didn't smoke heroin.
- Salvador, where are you?
- At home.
Still?
The movie ended, the audience is waiting.
Oh, yeah?
I'm with Salvador Mallo.
We both were thinking about coming.
Alberto Crespo is with me.
And the protagonist, Alberto Crespo.
Would you mind applauding again so
they can hear it? Maybe they'll come, then.
- Is everybody listening?
- Yes, Salvador.
Well, I would like to apologize
to the audience.
I didn't feel good at the last minute.
I'm with Alberto Crespo.
He stayed here with me.
Salvador, excuse me.
Someone is raising his hand,
I think he wants to ask you something.
It's a small question for the director.
Mr. Mallo, what do you think about Alberto
Crespo's interpretation in the film?
Some say that you didn't like it
and you two grew apart because of it.
Salvador, did you hear the question?
Yeah, yeah, I heard it.
I read that you had an argument
after Flavor.
That you hadn't seen each other.
Look... Time is mysterious.
I saw the film again a month ago,
and I think Alberto's interpretation
has improved a lot since the premiere.
What was it that you didn't like then?
His tediousness.
His lethal rhythm.
I conceived a dynamic character,
a funny, sarcastic cocaine addict.
Alberto didn't have the lightness
I was asking for.
Not because he was incapable,
but because he used the opposite drug
of his character, heroin.
And, well, the rhythm of his interpretation
was more serious,
and the humor of the text disappeared.
But I have to be fair. Now I believe
that seriousness suits the character.
It gives him... weight.
How dare you.
I wasn't planning on saying it,
but it's done.
Be careful with me, eh?
I won't allow you to humiliate me again.
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- I just told the truth.
Before filming, you promised me
you wouldn't use heroin.
I gave you the role on that condition
and you lied!
You did whatever the hell you wanted
and I had to tell you someday!
You're fucking crazy.
- I gave him all the messages.
- Right.
He's been avoiding me.
- Are you sure he's okay?
- He eats very little and chokes a lot.
Puree everything you make.
- Does he go out for walks?
- I don't see him.
But he walks around the house,
in the hallway.
Right.
I saw some moccasins at the entrance,
and he never liked moccasins.
He wears them. Even though he has tons
of nice tennis shoes.
Maya, tell him you don't mind
tying his shoes or his tennis shoes.
It must be hard for him
to tie his own shoelaces. Poor thing.
Sure, I tell him that, Mrs. Mercedes.
But he doesn't want me to.
I think he's embarrassed,
and I feel sorry for him.
I don't know what to do.
Well, smile and take care of him.
And if you see something strange, call me.
Mrs. Mercedes, everything's strange here.
Right.
May I help you?
I don't know.
What are you looking for?
Two stamp bags.
Ten euros.
- Ten euros?
- Yeah.
But don't bring me some shitty thing.
If it's good, I'll come back.
Give me the money.
- No, no, no. When you bring the merchandise.
- You pay cash now.
Wait for me here.
Come on! I'm gonna kill you. Come on!
- Come on!
- Want to fight?
Faggot, come on!
- Faggot!
- Come on, I'm gonna kill you, come on!
Come here. Come here.
Come here! Come on!
Look at the kid.
So little and look at him reading.
Listen, do you know how to write too?
Yes.
How much would you charge us
for writing a letter to my aunt in Bilbao?
I don't know.
What's going on?
We wanted your son
to write a letter for us.
Because my boyfriend is illiterate.
When am I gonna learn,
if I'm working all day long?
If you didn't waste your time drawing...
- Are you a bricklayer?
- And a painter.
Right. It's a shame that you're illiterate,
being so handsome.
My Salvador can teach
you to read and write.
Right?
In the evenings,
when you're done with work.
At the best time for you.
- Could you teach me math too?
- Yes.
Of course.
The four rules, so nobody cheats you.
It's backwards to be illiterate
in this world we live.
I'll bring pen and paper
to write the letter, okay?
- How much would you charge us?
- Nothing, woman. Nothing.
Since you're a bricklayer,
you could help me finish the kitchen
and paint the walls a little bit, eh?
- Whenever you can.
- It can only be Sunday.
Sundays, all right.
In exchange, my Salvador will teach you
to read and write, the four rules,
and today's letter for free.
Thank you.
A, B, C,
CH, D...
Eduardo, when are you putting the sink in?
I have to wash everything in these buckets.
I wanted to finish
whitewashing the walls first.
No, the sink is more urgent.
I'm used to the walls like this.
It's just that Salvador gives me
a lot of homework, and I don't have time.
Salvador?
If he wants to learn to read and write,
- he needs to memorize the alphabet.
- Okay.
Come on, Eduardo. Start again.
A, B, C,
CH, F, J...
No, Eduardo.
It's F, G, H, I, J, K.
- You said it right before.
- There are too many letters.
Stop complaining. It is what it is.
No, Eduardo. You don't hold it like that,
give me the pencil.
Look. You hold it like this, okay?
Now you do it.
- Like this?
- Yes, yes.
No, Eduardo.
You don't have to hold it so tight.
Relax your hand. I'll guide it.
- U...
- U...
I'm a little nervous.
It's okay. It's much better.
- Do you like to draw?
- A lot.
Then you'll learn to write very quickly.
Because writing is like drawing
but with letters.
Now you do it by yourself.
That's it.
Read the sentence.
"One...
holy...
catholic...
apostolic."
"One, holy, catholic, apostolic."
Who's that?
Spain. Who else?
Write it all continuously.
Very good, Eduardo.
You're stopping much less than before.
There are tons of invitations.
- It wouldn't hurt you to go out somewhere.
- "Cecil Beaton."
- I'll go with you wherever you want.
- I wish.
The dance season started.
Dimitris Papaioannou and Jan Fabre
are coming to the Canal Theaters.
Public theater seats are
the most uncomfortable for me.
And I don't want to leave in the middle.
Have you seen Dr. Galindo?
No. I'm fed up with doctors.
How do you get the oxycodone?
A friend gets it for me.
His mother's a pharmacist.
This book came for you.
"How to End Counterculture."
Whatever.
The Guggenheim is asking us for two
PÃ©rez Villalta paintings, for an anthology.
No, no. Tell them no.
Those paintings are my only company.
I live with those paintings, Mercedes.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Talk to me.
Yes.
Yeah, yeah, I'm listening.
I have to go.
I can't... I can't keep talking.
It's none of your business where I am.
Is there something wrong?
No.
Luis and I are splitting up.
I didn't know you had problems.
I didn't want to bother you.
This is an old issue and...
And now that I have to be at home so much,
I couldn't keep lying to myself.
I'm sorry.
So, if you don't mind,
I would like to keep
taking care of your mail.
People like getting an answer.
But it's always a no.
Well, you should do something.
You have too much free time
to think about your illnesses.
Give your brain
something to entertain itself.
I'd like to do some things too, Mercedes.
You could write.
You have a ton of documents full of ideas
to develop. I'll make you a list.
No,
I don't want to write if I can't film it.
You know better than anybody
that I can't face a shoot in this state.
Without filming, my life has no purpose.
But that's just how things are.
Call me, okay?
- Call me for whatever you need.
- Yeah.
Jacinta,
the cave looks beautiful.
Oh, and that light, my God, it's wonderful.
It rains sometimes.
You can't be so selfish, Jacinta.
Rain is necessary.
Think of the countryside, of farmers.
- Well, it's true.
- Of course.
Okay, Salvador. Let's see...
Since your mother told me that, at
9 years old, you were a teacher, I thought:
"This boy must be for God."
He's always been ahead of boys his age.
- Do you like to teach, Salvador?
- Yes.
- And would you like to study?
- Yes, very much.
Why?
To know more
and be able to teach more things.
Very good.
Very good. That's what I call a calling.
I'll talk to Father JosÃ© MarÃ­a,
and he'll take care of everything.
Thank you very much.
Salvador, next year,
you're going to high school at a seminary.
We'll see how you behave.
Not everybody gets a scholarship.
- So the scholarship is a sure thing?
- Yes, woman.
Don't worry.
And we'll see how you make me look.
Think, you're one of the chosen ones.
Well, I'm leaving.
I still have one visit to make.
- Don't you want some more juice?
- No, thanks. It was really good.
Bye, Salvador.
The whitewashed walls
look very nice, Jacinta.
- Yeah? It's better.
- It's beautiful.
To tell you the truth,
I'm quite jealous of you.
Me?
Sure, you live in catacombs
like ancient Christians.
Well, yeah, that's right.
Should I come sew on Sunday?
Yes, I'll see you on Sunday at home.
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.
- Mom.
- What, honey?
Is a seminary the place to become a priest?
Yes.
Do you want me to make you
the Spanish tortilla you like?
Handsome!
I don't want to be a priest!
You don't have to be.
Then why do you want
me to go to a seminary?
Because the poor have no other way
of studying. That's why.
What do you want me to do?
Salvador.
Salvador!
Salvador!
That boy...
Salvador! Come down from there!
- Come down.
- I don't want to go to the seminary.
You can leave when you finish high school.
We'll figure out a way
for you to have a career.
So you don't have to live like your father.
I don't want to go to school.
I want to stay here.
And what will you do here, son?
What will you do here?
Break your back working in the fields?
Or in construction? Is that what you want?
I don't want to be a priest.
"Life disgusts me as a useless medicine.
It is then when I clearly feel
how easy it would be to get away
from this tediousness
if I had the simple strength
to want to really push it away."
Who is it?
- It's me.
- Go away.
- If you don't leave, I'll call the police.
- Alberto, I'm here to negotiate.
I'll give you the rights
to interpret "The Addiction."
I don't believe you.
- Go away. I'm busy.
- I mean it.
I have here a copy of the text.
Please, open the door.
If this is a trap, you'll leave more
of a hunchback than you already are.
What, are you on a hunger strike?
Are you still thinking of doing everything
at the Mirador Theater?
Yes.
But I have a lot of doubts.
The text is very nice, but it's obsolete.
If you really give me "The Addiction,"
I'll get completely into it.
I would have to tell the people
at the Mirador, of course.
Here it is.
Why the change?
I looked at the text,
like you said, and...
- I'll tell you more if you give me some tea.
- Sure.
Anything else?
Yes, I don't want to sign it.
And don't say it's mine.
- I don't want to appear anywhere.
- All right. Will you direct me?
No, no.
- Man, that would help.
- No, no.
Give it to the theater, and let them
read it and see if they're interested.
But don't give my name.
- So who's the author?
- You are.
Or we make up a pseudonym.
No, no, no. I'll sign it. I'll sign it.
But I don't get you.
It's a confessional text.
- I don't want anybody to identify me.
- Right.
Regarding the staging,
I suggest an empty stage,
a screen, a chair.
If you don't know what to do
with your arms and hands.
I know well what to do
with my arms and hands.
After the corrections,
I admit, it is a bit less melodramatic.
Don't worry. I can also control melodrama.
My years in Mexico will be of use.
That's why I'm telling you,
you must avoid sentimentalism.
Control your emotions, don't cry.
You actors use any excuse to cry.
The better actor is not the one that cries,
but the one that fights the tears.
Let me give you a kiss, you faggot.
Listen, if you don't mind,
I'll start working right away.
If you want to stay, this is your house.
By the way, I have a ton of magazines
from the '80s. You appear in some of them.
Dressed as a woman.
- You forget about that too soon.
- Okay, but before, give me something.
And give me your dealer's address. Tell him
I'll come myself to pick up the merchandise.
That's not necessary. Now they bring it
to your house, like a pizza.
Lighter.
Here.
- No. Not yet.
- Why?
I'm lowering my dose just enough
to be able to work.
Can you do it?
How do you think I'm here?
Coming and going.
It's slavery.
But this play is vital for me.
And I must do it as clean as I can.
I don't want to lose one bit...
of the feeling you put into these pages.
Will you come see me?
I don't know. I don't think so.
This time I'm not doing Shakespeare.
Or Chekhov, or Lorca.
I'm doing you.
I'll feel terrible if you do it wrong.
And if you do it right,
I'll feel much worse.
"My childhood movie theater...
always smells like pee."
And jasmine.
And a summer breeze.
I met Marcelo in a bathroom full of people.
It wasn't the first time I saw him.
But it was that night...
after casually rubbing
against each other...
when I found out I liked that boy.
We spent the whole weekend in bed.
And without realizing it,
a year had gone by.
And now we couldn't
live without each other.
It was 1981...
and Madrid was ours.
One day, I found Marcelo paler than usual.
Lately, he had lost weight
and had dark circles under his eyes.
I asked him if he didn't feel well,
and he confessed he had started
to fool around with heroin.
I was surprised
because I had never tried it.
I drank and sniffed cocaine
like everybody else.
But heroin, never.
I had a feeling that wasn't good,
and I didn't like it.
I was in a whirlwind, I wrote a column on
nightlife, I participated in music shows,
I sang in a parodic punk band,
I was preparing my first film, I filmed it,
it was released, it was successful.
I wrote the second one, I filmed it.
I did a thousand things, I didn't sleep...
while Marcelo languished
on the couch at home.
Or locked in the bathroom.
Or out of the house
at some place I didn't know about.
I would spend the night coming and going
from the window to the bed.
Waiting to hear the sound of the door.
MIRADOR THEATER - ACTING SCHOOL
ADDICTION
Madrid had become a difficult arena,
like bullfighters say.
So we traveled a lot.
Anything to get out of Madrid.
The worst were the first few days.
While Marcelo recovered from the cravings,
I took care of him...
and wrote.
I don't know how,
but I wrote.
Marcelo was very young,
the cravings were short, three, four days.
Afterwards, we would go out
and play like little kids.
I remember Ivory Coast.
Tens of strong young guys washing
their clothes in the river.
On car tires.
The MalecÃ³n in Havana.
During the day or night.
Old Havana, sweetly pulsing to the rhythm
of nonstop percussion.
I remember Mexico City.
Marcelo and I drunk,
listening to Chavela Vargas sing
"La Noche de mi Amor."
I want
The happiness of a boat returning
A thousand bells of glory ringing...
The only reason for those trips was
to escape Madrid.
Escaping from the heroin...
became my best learning experience.
In those trips, I found the inspiration
to write the stories
that I would tell years later
and the colors that would illuminate them.
But we couldn't spend our lives traveling.
Sooner or later,
we had to come back to Madrid.
And Madrid was a minefield,
a dead-end street.
I was desperate, I didn't know what to do.
Except repeating myself.
The two of us repeated ourselves
for three long years.
I believed the strength of my love
would defeat his addiction.
But that didn't happen.
Love is not enough.
Love may move mountains...
but it's not enough
to save the person you love.
Under the whitewashed wall
where my childhood movies were screened,
I would pray so nothing bad happened
to the protagonists.
But I didn't manage to do it.
Not with Natalie Wood or Marilyn.
Then I tried to save Marcelo and myself.
If Marcelo saved himself,
it was far away from me.
And me, I stayed in Madrid.
And film saved me.
CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF
Come in.
Hello.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Come in.
- Do we know each other?
- Yes.
I don't remember you.
A long time ago, when you were preparing
Flavor with Salvador Mallo...
- I'm sorry, I don't remember.
- We saw each other two or three times.
I'm Federico,
the Marcelo from your monologue.
- Did you like the show?
- I don't know.
"Like" is not the word.
It had a great impact on me.
- You were the one who was crying, right?
- Yes, I guess.
Sit down.
I suppose you have some questions for me.
Is Salvador alive?
How was the show tonight?
Very good, it was sold out.
Too bad the theater's small.
That's better, it's more intimate.
A very intimate spectator came tonight.
Who?
I'll tell you if you promise
to come watch me.
Who is the intimate spectator?
Federico.
Federico who?
Federico Delgado.
Your Marcelo.
He came to see me in the dressing room.
- Did he recognize the text?
- Every word.
He asked me for your number and address.
- You didn't tell him anything else?
- No.
I didn't say anything
about you chasing the dragon.
Thanks. I'll come and see you sometime.
Right.
INCOMING CALL
DECLINE - ACCEPT
CALL FROM ARGENTINA
Salvador?
- Yes.
- Is it you?
I wouldn't have recognized your voice.
It's Federico.
Federico.
I'm in Madrid.
What are you doing here?
I came to see some lawyers regarding
an inheritance. I'm leaving tomorrow night.
I would like to see you.
Me too.
But I was already in bed.
Do you mind if we meet tomorrow?
Is noon okay for you? I have the meeting
with the lawyer in the afternoon.
Perfect, yes.
I haven't asked you how you are.
Old.
Five years more than me, not one more.
And you, how are you?
I'm better now.
I was devastated when I left the theater.
I went to see The Addiction.
- And how did you know about it?
- It was a coincidence.
I took a walk around Embajadores to see
our street, I was in front of our house.
Of course.
The theater is up the street.
I went in to kill time and because I
remembered Alberto Crespo from your movie.
And you found yourself suddenly...
Yes, suddenly.
I don't know how to ask you to forgive me.
I didn't know how you felt.
How much you suffered.
It was a good learning experience.
What?
You don't have to apologize.
I didn't do anything
that I didn't want to do, Federico.
I tried to help you
- as much as I could.
- And I'm thankful,
and I would like to be able
to prove it someday.
Listen, look. I don't think
I'll be able to sleep after this.
Would you give me 20 minutes
to take a shower and get dressed,
and I'll see you at my house?
All right, yes.
Hello?
- This is Federico. Can you open the door?
- All right.
It's been so long, son of a bitch.
Come here.
Yeah.
So long.
Would you have recognized me
if you saw me on the street?
I would've had to pay attention, but yes.
You have the same eyes.
- I'm sorry I made you get out of bed.
- No, no. Come in.
It's like a museum.
Everything I've earned, I've invested it
in this house and these paintings.
- I'll give you a tour later.
- Yeah.
- What do you want to drink?
- Anything. Tequila?
Sure, tequila.
In honor of Chavela.
When you mentioned her in your monologue,
I couldn't hold my tears.
Well, all right.
Tequila for Chavela
- and to celebrate our reunion.
- Yes.
I love your house.
Where do you live now?
In Buenos Aires.
You had an uncle in Buenos Aires.
Yes, I went there in '85.
- So soon?
- Yeah.
Do you want the story now
or after we make a toast?
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
The story.
After we split up,
I lived for a year with my parents.
At the time, the heroin routes didn't come
through Argentina.
So I moved in with my uncle,
and I started working at his restaurant.
I couldn't use
because there wasn't any heroin.
So that was the best way to get clean.
I met Lucrecia, my wife.
We got married.
Now I have two older kids,
my own restaurant...
And in all these years, I've only come back
to Galicia to see my parents.
This is the first time I've come to Madrid.
As you say in your monologue,
Madrid had become
a difficult arena for me.
A minefield.
Too bad that you lived here.
I needed Madrid.
I also needed you.
But not in that state.
Love is not enough to save the person
you love, you say it in your monologue.
Let's not talk about the monologue,
it's a very sad text.
I was relieved when...
you said that while you took care of me,
you continued to evolve as a writer
and a filmmaker.
Did you really feel that way?
You didn't interrupt anything, Federico.
On the contrary,
you filled my life
like nothing and nobody...
has filled it until now.
So you hadn't come back to Madrid
since then?
No.
But I followed everything you did.
And... And I was happy
when I recognized a scene
that was clearly inspired by us.
Each one of your films was
an event in my life, and I felt proud
because you were successful
all over the world.
You are the only Spanish director
that my family knows.
Your new family.
Yes.
Do they know anything else?
Do you mean about us?
Lucrecia, my wife.
Well, my ex-wife, we're getting separated.
Yes, I told her.
She doesn't know it was you.
She knows I was with a guy in Madrid
for three years.
And I also told one of my sons
to encourage him.
In time, I'll tell him it was you.
He's a film buff and he wouldn't forgive me
if I didn't tell him.
Do you have a partner now?
Yes.
And you?
No, no.
- A man or a woman?
- A woman.
My experience with men ended with you.
I don't know how to take that.
Take it as a compliment.
This is Mauro, the youngest one.
And this is Federico.
He's 22 now.
- He looks a lot like you.
- Yeah.
He's the one I told about us.
Both very handsome.
You have to come to Buenos Aires,
you will love that city.
And I'm sure it'll inspire you.
I want you to meet my family,
to come eat at the restaurant,
to get drunk together.
For old times' sake.
Do you want me to stay tonight?
Of course I want you to.
But let's close our story as God intended.
We never cared about God, and we
can close our story tomorrow morning.
Anyway, I'm glad to see...
that I still turn you on.
Me too, you are also turned on.
Yes, go, go. Go.
Yeah, I'm going.
You're right.
As always.
Remember, you promised to come
and visit me in Buenos Aires.
Have a good trip.
- Thanks a lot for coming, really.
- I'll call you to remind you about it.
Yes, Salvador?
- Mercedes, is this a good time?
- Yes, yes, tell me.
Look, I would like to see Dr. Galindo
as soon as possible.
- What did you have?
- Nothing.
Just an anxiolytic two hours ago
and some tequila shots.
Now I'm going to take my legal dose
of crushed pills with yogurt.
Want me to make an appointment
with the gastroenterologist?
- Yes, as soon as possible.
- All right.
- All right, bye.
- Bye.
- Salvador Mallo?
- Yes.
Come this way, please.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- Good morning, doctor.
- Morning, come in.
PAIN UNIT
DR. A. GALINDO
Thank you for making room for us.
It's okay. Talk to me, Salvador.
My back is killing me.
The oxycodone has almost no effect.
We'll have to change the painkiller.
How come you didn't come earlier?
- I was in a very low mood.
- Yes, he's been very depressed.
And what have you done to control the pain?
I started using heroin.
- And do you plan to keep using it?
- No. That's why I'm here.
How often were you using?
Every two or three days.
In the end, every other day.
Smoked.
- And when was the last time you used?
- The night before last.
Am I gonna have withdrawal symptoms?
A little, but with a compassionate
and controlled detox, you won't suffer.
Compassionate and controlled?
Yes, that's what it's called.
Do you have someone to assist you?
Yeah, yeah. I'll be with him.
And how have you controlled this day
and a half that you haven't used?
With anxiolytics
and an iron will.
Well,
you'll continue to need that iron will
because your mind already knows
the effect of heroin,
and that's something you don't forget.
Are you still taking Pamelor for your head?
Yes, and everything else.
For asthma, blood pressure,
insomnia, yes.
But I need you to help me especially
with my back pain.
And to put some order
in everything I'm taking.
Also with the migraines.
The back pain and headaches...
completely cripple me.
I understand.
Do you have any projects, Salvador?
Yes, improving my quality of life.
I'm talking about work.
It'd be good for you to stay busy.
Don't you miss it?
Not a day goes by that I don't think of it.
But the question is not
whether I miss it or not.
Film is a very physical job.
Unfortunately, I am in no condition
to do that. Really, that's my main problem.
- People worse off than you get ahead.
- No, I know, I know.
But I haven't been able to do it.
My mother died four years ago.
Two years later, I had back surgery.
I still haven't recovered
from either of those things.
I need help, doctor.
Okay. I'm switching the oxycodone
for a different opioid.
The idea of heroin will cross your mind.
You have to be alert.
Yes.
I'm going to extend your prescriptions
and then I'll give you the instructions.
Do you mind if I step
out and move a little?
- No, no, go ahead.
- Go on.
- Doctor, thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
- Okay, let's see.
- There's something else, doctor.
Something else?
Salvador chokes often.
An hour ago, on our way to the hospital,
he had a sip of water
and I thought he was dying.
The gastroenterologist performed
an endoscopy
and they found a lump
pressing on the esophagus.
That's why he chokes so easily,
and we don't know what the lump is.
- Does he know the result of the endoscopy?
- No.
The doctor ordered a CAT scan to be sure,
but the gastroenterologist
hasn't ruled out a tumor.
What should I do? Should I tell him?
No, no, no.
Save him at least two days of anxiety.
And please,
call me with the CAT scan results.
Sure.
Mercedes,
would you please hand me that box?
Thanks.
Salvador, it means a lot to me
that you put me in your mom's bedroom.
Here's your afternoon snack.
Those dark muffins? Forget about it.
They're whole wheat.
Someday you're going to bring me
a plate of alfalfa
because now they say
it's good for your heart.
And you're not going to drink your milk?
You have to try.
Later.
Sit down.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to disentangle these rosaries.
- Here, I'll help you.
- No. You don't know how.
- Do you remember how you need to shroud me?
- Yes, Mom, yes.
If we are in the village, you call Petra.
She's used to it.
And if I die here,
which I hope doesn't happen
because I want to die in my bed,
Maya and Mercedes will help you.
- Do we have to talk about this now?
- Yes.
On my head...
a half-circle mantilla.
Because I'm a widow.
Let me help you.
Come, I'll help you. Let's see.
There.
And the habit of Jesus of Medinaceli.
- With its cord.
- Right, with its cord.
You put a rosary in my hands.
This one, the old one.
I want you to keep the new one.
- Wouldn't you rather have the new one?
- No.
I want to be barefoot.
If they tie my feet to bury me, untie them
and tell them I asked you to do it.
I want to be very light where I'm going.
Do you remember this pen?
- Of course.
- Your father gave it to me.
I wrote all my letters with it
when we were dating.
And the wooden egg, Mom?
I wonder how much I mended with this egg.
It's the least valuable thing in here.
Well, give it to me.
Here. You just inherited it.
I think about her a lot lately.
It's the first time I've heard you say you
haven't gotten over your mother's death.
I think a lot about my childhood too.
When I'm tossing and turning,
which is most of the time,
I always end up thinking of my mother
when I was a child.
But you've never talked about her
or your childhood in your films.
- My mother didn't like that.
- You think?
She told me one of the last times
she was at the hospital.
Your legs are so clean, Mom.
I got that from my family.
No one had varicose veins in my family.
It's a shame, son.
What's that?
You won't have a good old age.
Why's that?
You're like your father's family.
Oh, Mom. The things you say.
Come on, tell me, how was your night?
So-so.
I spent all night with my neighbor Lola.
Here, in the room?
Of course not. In my dreams.
I dreamt of her all night.
I had just arrived in the village,
and I heard Lola knocking
on the door as usual
when she heard me arriving from Madrid.
Even though it was a dream,
I remembered Lola was dead.
But I opened the door.
And I found her the same as always,
even if she was a little translucent.
But I... I wasn't scared.
And I told her, "Lola,
I guess you're not okay
and you want me to do something.
But you need to tell me what
and I promise I'll do it."
"No, Jacinta. I'm fine," she said.
"But how can you be fine?" I asked her.
"If you were fine, you wouldn't appear."
"I appear to you
because my daughters get very scared."
"But how can you come to the village
when it's this cold?"
"I'm not cold or hot anymore,"
she answered.
"And there's no place like home."
"You're completely right, my friend,"
I told her.
And what else?
Don't make that narrator's face, eh?
No, no, no. I don't want you
to put any of this in your movies.
I don't want my neighbors to be in them,
I don't like autofiction.
What do you know about autofiction?
I heard you explaining it in an interview.
My neighbors don't like it
when you showcase them.
They feel you treat them like hicks.
Mom, what are you saying?
I can't treat them
with more respect and devotion.
Every opportunity I have, I talk about you
and I say I was educated by you
and the neighbors.
I owe everything to you.
They don't like it.
Let's go for a walk, you haven't moved yet.
I haven't moved
because I don't have anywhere to go.
- Now you have somewhere to go. Come on.
- Where?
To the hallway.
That's it.
You haven't been a good son, my son.
I haven't?
No.
You never forgave me for recommending you
to Paterna's lay sister.
And you took revenge for that.
I didn't want you to go
to the seminary either.
But we were poor.
It's true I didn't want to go,
but to think I wanted to get revenge?
How can you think that?
After high school,
you couldn't wait to leave for Madrid.
And when your father died,
I asked if you wanted me
to come live with you.
You dodged the question.
You said you had a lifestyle
that you couldn't share with me.
And it was true.
But not in the way you understood it.
I understood perfectly well.
I have really bad legs,
but my head works perfectly well.
When I wasn't traveling, I was filming.
You wouldn't have endured the loneliness
of an apartment in Madrid.
That was no life for you.
I would've taken care of you.
I would've adapted,
like I have adapted to so many things.
But you didn't want to.
And that hurt me.
Mom...
I'm very sorry
for not having been the kid you wanted.
When you used to say:
"Who does this kid take after?"
you didn't exactly say it with pride.
And I was aware of that.
Have I failed you
just by being the way I am?
I'm really sorry.
Pass me St. Anthony.
Tonight, I'll pray for you.
Thanks a lot.
- Salvador...
- Yes.
I brought you into this world,
and I did everything to raise you.
I know, Mom.
Take me to the village.
This is my one and only wish.
All right.
You and I will go to the village.
And Maya, to help around the house.
I'll take care of you day and night.
I won't fail you this time, Mom.
But I couldn't keep my promise.
I had to take her
to the hospital the next day.
You did everything you could.
Yeah.
But she wanted to die in the village.
And I had promised to take her.
The poor woman died
in the hospital's ICU...
alone.
They're inviting you
to give a talk in Iceland. Well paid.
I don't understand
why they like me so much in Iceland.
Me neither.
And this one is from a small gallery.
But I didn't throw it away,
I like the drawing.
Salvador Mallo?
- Yes.
- You may come in.
Sit down here, slowly.
While I hold your legs,
you turn around and lie down.
Yes, thanks.
- Hey, when does your mother get back?
- At lunchtime.
When she goes sewing
at the lay sister's house,
she stays there all morning.
Let's see.
Let's see, Salvador. Don't move.
Stay there.
Can you hold the book with both hands?
Like that.
Okay, lift your head.
What do you think?
It's very pretty.
I still have to finish it.
I'll take it home and finish it.
Yeah.
Do you mind if I wash up? Look at me.
Yeah, I'll go get the soap.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Salvador, would you bring me a towel?
I'm coming, Eduardo.
You're burning up.
You probably got sunstroke.
Salvador, what happened?
He got too much sun.
I was reading.
But you didn't realize you were in the sun?
You're burning up!
- I didn't realize.
- And you?
I finished putting up the tiles.
And when he fainted, I brought him here.
You fainted?
A little. I lost my head.
Oh, my God.
Stay here. I'll get a rag with vinegar.
And your father? At the bar?
Yes.
He told me he was staying home.
What's this bucket doing here?
I washed myself a little.
You could wait until you get to your house,
couldn't you?
It's an effort for me
to carry the water all the way here.
I was very dirty.
Should I grab a bucket and wipe the floor?
No, fetch the water, I'll wipe it.
The tiles look nice.
Yes, very nice. Thanks.
I'll get the water.
First of all, I want to reassure you,
there's no tumor.
We have completely ruled that out.
Okay, but something's wrong with me
because I even choke on puree.
Yes, what happens to you, this dysphagia,
is due to the Forestier syndrome.
You'll see it more clearly here.
You see this white part
next to the vertebra?
It's an osteophyte.
An ossification.
Here, you can see the esophagus displaced
by this ossification.
There's barely any space for food
to pass through, even liquids.
That's why you're choking.
Why has that bone grown so much there?
Forestier syndrome is a rare illness,
and we don't know what causes it.
We know it affects tendons,
ligaments and joint capsules that calcify,
but we don't know why.
In your case, the anterior ligament
of the cervical spine was calcified.
- Is there anything you can do?
- Surgery.
We need to remove that calcification
as soon as possible.
But don't worry. It's not a risky surgery.
The gastroenterologist and your surgeon
will give you more information.
- All right.
- Thank you.
POPULAR ART
Hello.
Are you interested in the watercolor?
Yes, I'd like to buy it. Who's the author?
It's anonymous.
Almost all the pieces have no signature.
How did it get here?
I bought it in the Encants market
in Barcelona.
It's one of my favorite pieces.
So you have no idea who painted it?
There's something written on the back.
But these are all anonymous artists that
probably don't even know they're artists.
Dear Salvador, I'm sending
the drawing to your house
because I don't have the school's address.
I'm happy I'm able to write to you.
You taught me how to write,
and I'm very grateful.
I'm working at Conchita's uncle's store,
and I'm good with numbers,
all thanks to you.
I have a good life here,
but I miss life in the caves
and especially you.
Every time I write,
I think about your hand guiding mine.
I'm sure you're learning a lot at school,
reading lots of books
and watching lots of movies.
Here is my address in Bilbao,
so you can write and tell me how you are.
Your student, Eduardo.
Salvador.
You have to get dressed in half an hour.
Let me know a little bit before.
THE FIRST DESIRE
What do you think
happened with the drawing?
Eduardo sent it to Paterna,
my mother probably received it.
I was already at the seminary.
She didn't send it or tell me about it.
Will you try to find him?
Eduardo?
It's easier with Google now.
Or going to Paterna and asking about him.
Fifty years later?
It's a good plot for a story,
and I may write it,
but it'd be crazy to look for him.
I wonder how the drawing ended up
in Barcelona's flea market.
I have no idea.
By chance.
What matters is that the drawing made it
to the recipient.
Salvador, what's up?
We're going to switch beds,
little by little.
Stay still.
- Very good, your head goes here.
- Yes.
- I have to open this up a little, okay?
- Okay.
And I'm gonna put some stickers
on your chest.
How are you, Salvador?
Hello, doctor.
I heard about it.
No wonder you couldn't swallow.
But don't worry, okay?
We'll take it out right away.
- Doctor.
- Talk to me.
- I'm writing again.
- Oh, really? Great news.
Yeah.
I'm really glad, Salvador.
And what is it? A drama or comedy?
I don't know.
You don't know that.
Mom?
Do you think there's a movie theater
in Paterna?
I'll settle for a house, son.
Cut.

TOLLER: I have decided to keep a journal.
Not in a word program or
digital file, but in longhand,
writing every word out so that
every inflection of penmanship,
every word chosen, scratched
out, revised, is recorded.
To set down all my thoughts and the
simple events of my day factually
and without hiding anything.
When writing about oneself,
one should show no mercy.
I will keep this diary for one year, 12 months.
And at the end of that time,
it will be destroyed.
Shredded, then burnt. The
experiment will be over.
[DOOR OPENS]
Please rise.
What is thy only comfort in life and death?
ALL: That I with body and
soul, both in life and death,
am not my own, but belong unto
my faithful Savior Jesus Christ,
who with his precious blood...
TOLLER: These thoughts and recollections
are not so different
from those I confide to God every morning.
When it is possible. When he is listening.
Bread of life. The cup of salvation.
[COUGHING]
Bread of life. The cup of salvation.
Bread of life. The cup of salvation.
This journal is a form of speaking,
of communication from one to the other.
A communication which can be achieved simply
and in repose without prostration or abnegation.
It is a form of prayer.
Bread of life. The cup of salvation.
ELDER: There, uh, is a leak
in the men's restroom.
- TOLLER: No, I fixed it.
- No. I was just there. It's still leaking.
- Same place. Under the hot faucet.
- TOLLER: What about the women's room?
The women's is fine. Uh, do you want me to call
- the plumber from Abundant Life?
- No, I'll have another crack at it.
I hate always bugging them for extra little costs.
They don't mind. That's what they're there for.
- And you're totally within your budget.
- Still, I don't want to.
- Have you posted the sermon?
- Yes.
- I did it this morning.
- [KNOCK ON DOOR]
- TOLLER: Oh, hi...
- Reverend?
Yes, uh... Mary, right?
- Mary Mansana.
- Yeah. Nice to see you again.
- I wanted to... talk, if that's okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on in, Mary.
I'll be right back.
- Mary, how can I help you?
- Um, I was wondering if you would talk
- to my husband, Michael.
- Oh, sure. I...
Actually, not now. He has to...
He has to go to work. He has
to fill in at Home Depot.
Mary?
What is it?
I'm worried about him.
He's involved in the Green Planet
movement. It's an activist group.
Mmm-hmm.
And he was in jail in Canada.
And he just got out two weeks ago. He just sits
around at home. He doesn't... he doesn't go out.
I got him to fill out a temp form
for Home... for Home Depot.
- Okay.
- Um, so that's good.
Are you sure you don't want
to go to Abundant Life?
They have a whole team of counselors over there,
- who are trained and...
- I know, but he doesn't want to.
He thinks it's more of a company than a church.
And so, he said he would talk to you.
Uh, all right. Tomorrow?
- After lunch?
- Great. Great.
I'll just need the, uh... I just need an address.
And, uh, can you tell me a little more?
Oh, he applied for Compassionate
Release when he found out.
He was at Fort Providence.
They let him out early.
Wait, now. Um, found out what?
- That I... I was pregnant.
- Oh. Hmm. Congratulations.
Thanks.
He... he thinks it's wrong to
bring a child into this world.
He wants to kill our baby.
[TICKING]
TOLLER: I assisted Sunday the
youth group at Abundant Life.
The young people were so
excited, so full of life.
They were open. They welcomed communion.
Maybe I shouldn't care about
whether people like me.
Did Jesus worry about being liked?
I look at the last lines I wrote with disdain.
Twelve months.
Can I keep up an exercise that long?
[EXHALES DEEPLY]
When I read these words,
I see not truth, but pride.
I wish I had not used the word pride.
But I cannot cross it out.
If only I could pray.
[COUGHING]
[EXHALES]
[KNOCKS]
- Hi, Reverend.
- Hi.
- Is Michael home?
- Yeah. Come on in.
Okay. Yeah.
- Hey. Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.
Um, would you like some coffee?
- Yes. But, um...
- We're... I... I think we have some tea.
Yes. That would be better.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- [SIGHS]
- Let me take your coat?
[CHUCKLES] Um, no, it's okay. I got it.
Come on in.
- Yeah. I... I don't know why Mary...
- There's no need to apologize.
No, uh... she told me that
you've been up in Canada.
Uh, yeah. Uh, Fort Providence.
It's, uh, in the Mackenzie
Delta. It's way in the north.
- Yeah. Beautiful country, I imagine.
- Yeah, it is. [CHUCKLES]
Mary said things have been getting you down?
[CHUCKLES] Uh, yeah, things.
Yeah, you could say that. Yeah.
Oh! Thank you very much.
- It's hot.
- Perfect.
Thank you.
- Well, Mary is pregnant.
- Hmm.
- Yeah. How far along is she?
- Uh, 20 weeks.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Hey, how old are you, Reverend?
I'm 46.
Uh, 33.
That's... that's how old our child will be in 2050.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
- You know, that's...
- That's two years older than I am right now.
- Mmm-hmm.
- You'll be 81.
- [LAUGHS] Yeah.
Hey, you know... you know what
the world will be like in... in 2050?
- Hmm. Hard to imagine.
- Yeah, you think?
I mean, Reverend...
Uh, the... the world is... is changing so fast.
And right in front of us.
I... I mean, one third of the natural world
has been destroyed in your lifetime.
You know, the earth's temperature will
be three degrees centigrade higher.
Four is the threshold.
You know? "Severe, widespread,
and irreversible impacts."
And when scientists say
stuff like that, you know?
And National Center for Atmospheric Research,
Lawrence Livermore, the Potsdam
Institute. Uh, Reverend...
TOLLER: He went on like that for some time.
By 2050, sea levels two feet
higher on the East Coast.
Low lying areas underwater across the world.
Bangladesh, 20% loss of landmass.
Central Africa, 50% reduction
in crops due to drought.
The Western reservoirs dried up. Climate
change refugees. Epidemics. Extreme weather.
MICHAEL: You know, the...
The bad times, they will begin.
And from that point, everything
moves very quickly.
You know, this social structure can't
bear the stress of multiple crises.
Opportunistic diseases, anarchy,
martial law, the tipping point.
And this isn't in some, like, distant
future. You will live to see this.
You know, my... my children will
experience this unliveability.
This, uh...
Damn. I'm sorry. I just... you know, I... I
thought things could change, you know?
I thought... I thought people would listen.
Do you have thoughts of harming yourself?
No.
- Why? Did... did Mary say something like that?
- No. No.
No, I'm not worried for myself. I just...
This world... is gonna be what it is.
- Um... but can I ask you a question, Reverend?
- TOLLER: Mmm-hmm.
How... how do you sanction
bringing in a little girl,
uh, for argument's sake, let's just say that, uh,
Mary and I's, uh, child, it's a little girl.
You know, a child that's so full of hope
and naive beliefs, into a world
where that little girl, uh...
She grows up to be a young woman
and she looks you in the eyes
and she says that you knew
this all along, didn't you?
You see, that...
I mean, what? What are you
supposed to say then?
There's something growing inside Mary.
Something as alive... as a tree, surely.
As an endangered species.
Something full of the beauty
and mystery of nature.
You said sanction?
You think Mary should have an abortion?
This birth, is that your right?
Is that your decision?
Have you asked Mary what she thinks?
Look, this... this isn't... it's not about your baby.
It's not about Mary.
It's about you and your despair.
Your lack of hope.
Look, people have, throughout history,
have woken up in the dead of the night,
confronted by blackness.
The sense that our lives are without meaning.
- "The Sickness Unto Death."
- Yeah, but this is something different.
Yeah, no. Man's great achievements
have brought him to the place where life as we
know it may cease in the foreseeable future.
Yes, that's new.
But the blackness
that's not. We are scientific people. We want
to solve things. We want rational answers.
Right? And if... if humankind can't
overcome its immediate interests
enough to ensure its own
survival, then you're right.
The only rational response is despair.
But do you think that, that... that there's
any e... existence apart from this?
This here, right now?
- Uh, yes.
- Yeah, right.
- Before us. After us.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Wait a second.
You're talking about the next lifetime? Huh?
You really... you just, uh...
TOLLER: I felt like I was Jacob wrestling
all night long with the angel.
Fighting in the grasp.
Every sentence, every question,
every response a mortal struggle.
It was exhilarating.
MICHAEL: You believe in martyrdom, Reverend?
- I'm not sure I know what you mean.
- You know, the... the Saints of God,
the early Christians who wouldn't
renounce their faith?
The... the missionaries who were
attacked in the fields of the Lord.
Do you believe that they died for a purpose?
- TOLLER: I do.
- Well, every week,
activists are killed trying to
protect the environment.
A hundred-and-seventeen were
killed last year for their beliefs.
All right, right there. Uh, this is
JosÃ© Claudio Ribeiro da Silva.
Huh? And that's his wife, Maria.
Uh... ye... they... they were gunned
down in... in 2011 in the Amazon.
You know, they were protesting
free cutting of the rain forest
[TOLLER SIGHS]
Hey, uh... this is Dorothy Stang, 2005.
She was, um, a nun from Ohio.
And what, what was the purpose of their deaths?
You know, in, uh... in 2010, the IPCC predicted
that if drastic action wasn't taken by 2015,
environmental collapse would be irreversible.
And nothing was done.
And now it's 2017.
TOLLER: You said you respected me.
What I... what I've been through.
- Yes.
- So, you know my story.
- You were a chaplain.
- Uh-huh.
My father taught at VMI. I encouraged my
son to enlist. It was the family tradition.
Uh, like his father, my father before me.
A patriotic tradition.
My wife, uh, was very opposed.
My son enlisted anyway. And, uh...
Six months later he was dead in Iraq. Right?
I talked my son into a war that
had no moral justification.
My wife could no longer live with me.
I left the military.
I was lost.
And Reverend Jeffers from Abundant
Life, he... gave me this position
at First Reformed and here I am.
Now Michael, I can promise you
that whatever despair you feel about
bringing a child into this world
cannot equal the despair
of taking a child from it.
Hey, what... what was his, his name? Your son?
Joseph.
- The boy thrown down the well.
- [CHUCKLES] Yeah. I remember.
- The dreamer.
- The dreamer, yeah. Yeah.
[SIGHS DEEPLY]
And you were able to just go on?
Courage... is the solution to despair.
Reason... provides no answers.
I can't know what the future will bring.
We have to choose despite uncertainty.
Wisdom is holding two contradictory
truths in our mind, simultaneously.
Hope and despair.
A life without despair is a life without hope.
Holding these two ideas in
our head is life itself.
[SIGHS]
Are you a drinking man, Reverend?
Uh... it doesn't help.
No, I suppose not.
Can God forgive us?
For what we've, uh, done to this world?
I don't know.
Who can know the mind of God?
But we can choose
a righteous life.
Belief...
Forgiveness...
Grace covers us all.
I believe that.
Let's... let's meet again.
Want to?
Tomorrow after lunch, same time.
Okay yeah. It's a... it's a plan.
TOLLER: I went over everything that was said,
what should have been said,
what could have been said differently,
what could have been said better.
"I know that nothing can change
and I know there is no hope."
Thomas Merton wrote this.
Despair is a development of pride so
great that it chooses one's certitude
rather than admit God is
more creative than we are.
Perhaps it's better I didn't say that to him.
[GROANING]
- [SIGHS]
- [ZIPS PANTS]
[TOILET FLUSHING]
Who am I to talk about pride?
Well, to begin, the church was constructed in
1767 in a style we now call Dutch Colonial.
It was made by settlers... follow me.
Using local timber.
First Reformed took seven years to build.
The Vei Plancks. Uh, Effie here, her
tombstone dates back to 1787.
The church was partially rebuilt
in 1837 following a fire.
This section remains preserved.
If you look closely behind
the Continental Army Flag,
you'll find two bullet holes from shots fired
during the Skirmish of Snowbridge.
In two months we're celebrating
our 250th anniversary.
Here is an example of some of the church's
chinaware brought over from the Netherlands.
And the first chalice. It's beautiful.
And here, this is the original key
from the front door before the fire.
- [BOTH CHUCKLING]
- Yeah.
And in that cabinet we have, um,
souvenirs that are for sale.
We have mugs, caps, postcards,
key chains, pens, t-shirts.
What size are these?
Unfortunately, they are all small.
I have some more on order, but
I'm waiting for them to come in.
The caps are great, though.
It's a one size fits all.
[SIGHS]
The pulpit was donated in
1879 by William Mercer.
And the church organ,
which unfortunately isn't working at this time,
uh, was manufactured in England by A.G. Hill.
Did you hear the one about the
Choir Mistress and the Minister?
No.
She chased him around the church
and caught him by the organ.
[CHUCKLES HESITANTLY] Oh. No, I, uh...
I hadn't heard that one.
All right. Come on. Follow me.
All right. Thank you all very much.
- Be well.
- WOMAN: Thank you.
TOLLER: Yeah. Thanks a lot.
Drive safe.
Thanks.

Well, I have something after, but uh, yeah.
I could sit with you for a second.
ESTHER: Oh, remember that?
What?
When everything was ahead of you.
Yeah. But try telling them that. [CHUCKLES]
See you then.
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]
Hello.
- Reverend Toller.
- Yes.
Oh. Go right in.
- Okay.
- He's expecting you.
Um, this is... that's my wife's stuff. So.
- Go ahead and deal with it.
- [KNOCK AT DOOR]
Oh, good! Reverend Toller.
Come on in.
Roger, make sure you get back to
me as soon as you can on that.
Hey Reverend. Good seeing you.
Why don't you have a seat there?
Roger, okay to leave that door open.
- Can I get you a water or anything?
- Oh, no. I'm good. I'm good.
Good. So, how are things
over at First Reformed?
Busy. You know how it is.
You do one thing to the other, next
thing you know it's Sunday again.
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- [LAUGHS]
Well, I brought you in, I wanted to ask
you about the 250th Reconsecration.
- Now, that's just around the corner.
- Yeah, of course. It's only eight weeks away.
And how's the planning going on that?
Well, your office is handling the invitations
and I'm a little worried about seating.
I mean, because we have your staff. We
have the Elders. We have the Deacons.
We have the Governor, his people.
The Mayor, his people.
We don't have any room for spillover. You
know, it's the Sanctuary and that's it.
You know what? I think we'll simulcast
the ceremony here, in the main room.
- All right.
- So that's 5,000 seats.
- Yeah, okay. Well then...
- We can do the reception in the rotunda.
The, um... the organ at First Reformed.
- Is that fixed?
- Oh right, yeah. No, it's not.
We're waiting on some pieces.
I don't... it was... it's just more complicated
than we thought at first.
Well, we can't have a reconsecration
without an organ. [CHUCKLES]
[IMITATING ORGAN PLAYING]
"A Mighty Fortress is Our God."
- That's all organ.
- [LAUGHING]
Did you know that, uh, Martin Luther
wrote that in an outhouse?
- Oh. Yeah.
- [LAUGHING]
[IMITATING ORGAN PLAYING] "A Mighty Fortress..."
[BOTH LAUGHING]
I think every seminarian knows that one.
Oh, man, I cannot get that
image out of my mind.
I mean, whenever I see that song going on
and I can look around the congregation
and know everybody's thinking
the same thing. [LAUGHING]
This man, oh, goodness. Oh, makes me laugh.
- Anyway, have you, uh prepared your remarks?
- Ugh, no. Not yet. But, I will.
- So, how are you?
- Oh, I'm fine.
No, really.
I mean, it's been a while since we've talked.
And you know, even a pastor needs a pastor.
We should do it, okay?
- I'd like that.
- Good. And come by here more often.
You should get out. Come on
by and be a part of things.
So many activities you can do. And...
- And the kids like you a lot.
- Mmm.
They always speak highly of you.
So you can get out of that, uh...
What is the play? What do they like to call it,
over where you are? The, uh...
the museum. [LAUGHS]
The souvenir shop.
They call it the souvenir shop.
Well, good. Well, good. You're doing a great job.
I'm grateful for the opportunity.
[LOW INDISTINCT CHATTER]
- How was Jeffers?
- Oh. He wants me to meet Ed Balq.
Balq Industries, Balq Energy, Balq Paper,
- Balq Peanuts...
- Why?
Well, it's all about the Reconsecration.
And apparently Mr. Balq wants
to make sure he gets
- proper credit for underwriting the whole thing.
- Well, he should.
First Reformed would be a
parking lot if it wasn't for him.
I guess.
Did you see the doctor?
Yes. I made an appointment. There was a bit of
a hang up with the insurance company, but...
God, they make it so difficult.
Yeah, well. That's what they do.
TOLLER: Mmm-hmm.
You need someone to take care of you.
Esther, we tried that. I'm not made for that.
[SCOFFS] For what? Love?
You're not made for love?
My marriage was a failure.
No marriage can survive the loss of a child.
It's not right.
Is that what you think?
That what we did together was
a sin? That we transgressed?
No. That's not what I think.
I've seen enough real sin
to know the difference.
It's just...
Okay?
Okay. I understand, I...
I care about you. I want you to be happy.
Well, I am happy.
TOLLER: Some are called
for their gregariousness,
some are called for their suffering.
Others are called for their loneliness.
[GRUNTS]
They are called by God, because through
the vessel of communication
they can reach out,
and hold beating hearts in their hands.
They are called because of their
all-consuming knowledge
of the emptiness of all things
that can only be filled by
the presence of Our Savior.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
- Yes?
- MARY: Reverend Toller?
- Oh!
- It's me.
Yes, Mary? I got your message
about rescheduling.
You must come over. Now.
- Is Michael there?
- No. He's at work. You must come over. Now.
Okay. Okay.
[CAR ENGINE STOPS]
[CAR DOOR OPENS]
[CAR DOOR CLOSES]
[SIGHS] Thanks for coming.
Follow me.
I was, uh, looking for some batteries, 'cause
we were out. And I thought maybe
there'd be some in here, you know? And
then something just didn't seem right.
Okay, I put everything back the way I found
it, 'cause I wanted you to see... how it was.
Explosives?
It's a suicide vest.
And there's other elements in there too.
There's batteries and, um, detonators
and tubes of jelly.
You know, he'd been working
in the garage... lately and...
he said he was fixing a motor.
And I didn't question him.
Cause I... I was just happy that he was
doing something that made him happy.
- But you had no idea that he was thinking of...
- No. No suspicions. Nothing like this.
All right. Well. I'm gonna take this.
All right? This cannot remain here.
- I'm gonna take it and dispose of it. And...
- You're not gonna go to the police?
- No, I won't... do you... do you want me to?
- No! No, no, no.
I don't think it'd help.
I don't think anything good will come
from him feeling threatened.
I think I'm gonna come over tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Somehow, through our conversation,
I will address this.
- I'm so frightened.
- You don't mean that he, you're afraid of him?
- That he's gonna hurt you, right?
- No. No, no, no.
- I'm afraid for him.
- No? Okay. All right.
You know, are there other activists,
- like coming around, calling?
- No. There's nobody.
He has no friends. He's
barely even sociable, so.
All right, but he has you.
- Yeah.
- You'll stand by him?
- Yeah, absolutely.
- All right. Well, so will I.
TOLLER: Discernment intersects with
Christian life at every moment.
Discernment.
Listening and waiting for God's
wish what action must be taken.
My petty ailments have made me bad-tempered.
I fight the urge not to write down the
thoughts which come to my mind.
The desire to pray itself is a type of prayer.
[RETCHING]
How often we ask for genuine experience
when all we really want is emotion.
[CONTINUES RETCHING]
[COUGHING]
My hands shake as I write these lines.
I wasn't expecting you for
another couple weeks.
Uh, we got a message from the boss.
He said it was a top priority.
You're having some kind of big event here?
Yeah, the church is having
its 250th anniversary.
Abundant Life is planning... quite the ceremony.
[ORGAN PLAYING]
Hmm. A Mighty Fortress.
- [CELL PHONE CHIMES]
- Oh.
[CAR ENGINE STOPS]
[CAR DOOR OPENS]
[CAR DOOR CLOSES]
[PLANE PASSING OVERHEAD]
[BREATHING SHAKILY]
[CROW CAWING]
[CELL PHONE DIALING]
TOLLER: Yes, sir.
I mean, he had been fighting with depression.
That's why I was supposed to meet him.
I never imagined anything like this.
Were you in touch with the immediate family?
Well, his... his wife, Mary.
She's the one who first asked
me to meet with him.
Did she know about your text?
No. But she was concerned. We... we both were.
Have you notified her?
No.
I guess that's where I'm headed.
All right. Okay.
All right, do you mind if I
follow behind you? All right.
I knew his father.
- Really? What's he like?
- A businessman.
Morbid son of a bitch.
I guess it runs in the blood.
[ENGINE REVVING]
SHERIFF: Thank you, Reverend.
Mrs. Mensana, again I'm sorry for your loss.
If there's anything else that we
can do, please let us know.
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Officer.
Reverend. Thank you.
[SIGHS]
You didn't tell the police, right?
About?
No. No.
If you find anything else
like that, get rid of it.
As long as it's safe, I mean. Burn it, bury it.
Michael was troubled, but his cause was just.
There's no reason to bring
disrepute on that cause.
Yeah.
Are you an activist as well?
I share Michael's beliefs.
But not his despair. I mean, I wanna live. I
wanna be a mother. I wanna have this child.
- Do you have family nearby?
- My... yeah, my sister. She's in Buffalo.
- You might want to call her.
- I will.
So, he... he went into the garage?
Yeah.
What did he say?
Nothing.
[SIGHS]
Well, from a police point of view,
I imagine this is a pretty cut-and-dry case.
Still, I'd probably clean up the office,
maybe get rid of his laptop.
You...
MARY: Open it.
[SIGHS]
[SNIFFLING]
I'd sensed it.
What?
He was absent.
He was becoming someone I didn't know.
Like, before I was pregnant even.
And he was just so full of anger, you know?
Think I should probably call
my parents. My sister.
They should... they should know.
TOLLER: I stayed while she called her sister.
Her sister was going to drive down.
And her parents would come for the final rights.
Uh, hey, Bill. Chicken or beef?
- Uh, beef.
- Beef. Okay, great.
How've you been?
- I'm all right. Yeah.
- You okay?
Is that enough for you?
Thanks a lot, Reverend.
Did you want the chicken or the beef?
- Uh, the beef. Thank you.
- Beef? Yeah. Cool.
There you are. Careful, it's hot.
Reverend, I wanted to ask you...
- Oh, shit!
- Ow!
Damn. I'm sorry, Joseph! I'm so sorry.
TOLLER: Terrible night. No sooner than I
shut my eyes, desolation came upon me.
What is one's last thought
as you pull the trigger?
"There goes my head."
Or, "Jesus, watch over me?" Or neither?
I'm going to tear these pages out.
This journal brings me no peace.
It's self-pity. Nothing more.
[KEYBOARD CLACKING]
I awoke at three with a cry.
It's been five months since I
sensed the first warning signs.
I went into the church and
fell asleep on a bench.
How easily they talk about prayer,
those who have never really prayed.
WOMAN: Excuse me? Oh, my goodness!
Well, since I made my commitment, I...
I have felt the Lord moving in my life.
If happiness came in pill size, it
would have JC stamped on it.
[LAUGHTER]
Continuous release size.
I wake up feeling better.
My relationships are better.
And I got a raise last week.
I find myself in prayer without
even thinking about it.
Thank you, Jason. That is very inspiring.
Praise Jesus. My every breath is a prayer.
Uh, thoughts? Reactions? Yes? Cynthia.
Three months ago, my father got laid off.
He can't find any work.
Nobody loves the Lord more than my father.
He is always testifying, he volunteers.
Did he do something wrong?
Um... [CLEARS THROAT] You all know
Reverend Toller from First Reformed.
- [ALL GREETING]
- Hey, yeah. Hi. Yeah.
How... how do you answer this, Reverend?
Well, Cynthia. I'm sorry that
happened to your father.
There's a lot of church people, good
Christians, who see, uh, a connection
between godliness and prosperity.
But that's not what Jesus teaches.
That's not what Jesus lived. There's
no dollar sign on His pulpit.
There's no American flag either.
I think, Cynthia, what your
father is experiencing is...
Christians shouldn't succeed.
That's what he means.
Christianity is for losers?
Jake, Jake! [LAUGHS]
I just get tired of turn the other cheek.
Jesus didn't turn the other cheek.
Why stand for anything?
Take prayer out of the schools.
Give money to people too lazy to work for it.
And whatever you do, don't offend the Muslims.
I mean, no sooner do I mention the poor,
and this teenager jumps down my throat
like I just took a shit on the American
flag. Forgive my language. Oh, God!
Oh, Roger told me.
He was great. He was terrific. He's a good man.
Well, he said you kept your cool,
- and he admired you for that.
- There's just no middle ground with these kids.
Everything is so extreme.
It's the times. These are
frightening times. These...
These kids, they grow up in a world that,
you and I, we wouldn't even recognize.
Global warming, a sea of pornography,
hyper violent video games.
It's a world without privacy.
Each kid isolated, communicating on media.
It's a world without hope!
You don't know what it's like
to raise a kid in this...
No, I did raise a kid.
I didn't mean it like that.
I know you didn't.
They're just frightened. These kids,
- they want certainty.
- Mmm-hmm.
You know, don't think, follow.
Uh...
But they fall prey to extremism.
Jihadism is everywhere. Even here.
It's just... that's not the church that called me.
Nor me.
It's up to us. We have to listen and guide
and encourage our young members
to express themselves without judging them.
We have to lead by example.
We have to be patient.
[PLAYING ORGAN]
Oh, this sounds great.
I'm gonna have to sharpen my
chops for the Reconsecration.
- Do you know what they want to play?
- No, I have no idea.
Abundant Life is handling everything.
Invites, the seating.
Basically, I just introduce Joel.
And then he does his spiel, introduces
the Governor, maybe Ed Balq.
Oh, why him?
It's sort of his whole deal. I mean,
he's underwritten the whole thing,
paid to have the organ fixed.
- I do have another musical question for you...
- Oh. Take it from the top.
[PLAYING]
[CHUCKLES] It's actually a
kind of sad bit of business.
- Hm?
- The Michael Mansana memorial.
The scattering of his ashes.
He's asked me to arrange it.
He's asked you?
Well, he wrote a letter. He had some requests.
Then the Lord spoke to Job,
stepped from the storm.
He said, "Where were you when
I laid the Earth's foundations,
"marked out its dimensions,
laid its cornerstone,
"when the morning stars sang,
"and the angels shouted with
joy? Where were you?"
These surroundings were chosen by Michael
as the repository for his physical remains.
I say physical because his memories
and spirit live on with us,
as does his mission.
Michael cared about this world.
Perhaps too much.
The Abundant Life Youth Choir
will now sing for us, uh,
a song chosen by Michael.
[HARMONICA PLAYS NOTE]

- I'm good.
- All right.
- Mr. Balq!
- Hey!
- Hello!
- How are you?
- Very good! Very good.
- Very good. Good, good.
Hey. Sorry I'm late. I got, uh... I got held up.
- Oh, good. You know Reverend Toller, right?
- Well, only by sight. Ed Barq.
- Good to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.
Just bring me a coffee
- and the apple pie. All right?
- Okay. Thank you.
Uh, the apple pie. I know it's a clichÃ©,
but they make it right here.
It's organic. It's local.
I have a surprise for you.
I, uh... I stopped by the printer on the way over.
Oh. Ooh, nice. Nice. They did a great job.
Yeah. All the guests at the reconsecration
will get a copy. And then, uh...
there will also be a mailing. And... and of course
it will be available at the bookstore.
So how are the plans coming?
- Is the organ repaired?
- Oh yeah. It sounds beautiful. Better than ever.
Okay. Um, we drew up a little seating chart.
Now, Mayor Wilson will be there,
as well as the Governor.
at least he's going to try...
TOLLER: All of those mighty men of God,
servants of the cross. Years of service,
baptisms, confessions, funerals, sermons.
The hours in prayer,
the afflictions suffered. Did
God give them strength?
Reverend Toller will introduce me. I'll
go up, I'll introduce the Governor.
There'll be a song selection. Now, the main...
There won't be anything
political though, will there?
No. No, why would there be?
Well... oh. Sorry. Do you mind?
- Here you are.
- [CHUCKLES]
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Enjoy.
Well, I... I... I ask, uh, only cause,
um, this came to my attention.
It's a printout from a website.
Well, both First Reformed and Abundant
Life are mentioned by name.
It was a political event. And
a Neil Young protest song?
I was just respecting the wishes of the
deceased and... and... and his widow.
It was their instructions
for the memorial service.
At a toxic waste site with
the press in attendance?
There was no press invited. No.
This is just Mensana's friends.
It was a political act.
You and the choir represented
the Abundant Life Church.
And the Hanstown site, by the
way, isn't even polluted.
It was cleaned up with EPA superfunds.
- Well, Hanstown...
- No, no, of course not,
but just give me some credit, all
right? I'm in the energy business.
It's my business to stay informed.
[SIGHS] Look, sorry.
Reverend Toller didn't understand
the implications here.
- May I ask a question?
- BALQ: Yeah. Go ahead.
Will God forgive us?
Will God forgive us for what
we're doing to his creation?
That's what Mensana asked me when I visited him.
This... there's been a lot of loose
talk about environmental change.
There is scientific consensus.
Ninety-seven percent...
The man who says nothing
always seems more intelligent.
Why couldn't I just keep silent?
It's a complicated subject.
Not really. I mean, who benefits?
Cui bono? Who profits? That's
what I keep asking myself.
Besides the Biblical call to stewardship,
who profits when we soil
- our own nest? What's to be gained...
- Can we just agree to keep politics
out of the reconsecration service?
- Yes.
- Yes, but this isn't politics.
- I mean, what God wants is for...
- Oh, you, you, you, you...
You know the mind of God?
You spoke to him, personally?
He told you His plans for Earth?
Look, I understand, you're upset.
I mean, you found the body, correct?
Yes.
How?
I was supposed to meet him.
And he texted me, and... a change of location.
BALQ: And?
And I went there and he was dead.
So you counseled him, Reverend?
Yes.
You counseled him, then he shot himself?
JEFFERS: Ed?
Yes.
Well, I think you need to step back, Reverend,
and take a look at your own life
before you criticize others. Hmm?
TOLLER: Mary and I rode the park trail.
I had not ridden a bicycle,
I think, in 20 years.
I was afraid I would fall.
It's amazing the simple
curative power of exercise.
It's God given.
Thank you again.
Michael and I used to cycle twice a
week, and I've missed it so much.
Uh. I enjoyed it. It's been a long time.
[CHUCKLES] But it was under protest.
- I... I asked my doctor.
- Really? Still.
Um, can I ask you another favor?
Sure.
Could you box up Michael's things?
Or find somebody to do it?
You sure you want to give
them away so quickly?
Not, like... not give it away, just,
you know. Just box them up.
It just... you know, I feel...
It's just difficult to be around so
many smells and memories.
- You know?
- TOLLER: Yeah, I can... I can do it.
MARY: Okay. [SIGHS]
TOLLER: Have you decided what's next?
Um, the rent's paid for for two
months, so there's no hurry.
But, um, I'm gonna stay with my
sister and my brother-in-law.
- Hmm. Are you?
- Until the baby is born.
- Oh, so you'll relocate there?
- Yeah. I think so.
She contacted an obstetrician.
Are we talking pink or blue?
- Blue!
- Blue. Ah! Congratulations.
- Thanks.
- That's wonderful.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, uh... I have a question for
you, if, uh... if it's not too painful.
Do you think he, uh...
He really would have harmed someone?
Um, he'd been a part of some
non-violent protests.
We both had. He'd been put in jail.
He had a temper. I mean, he'd start yelling
at police, but no, I don't think he was...
No. I don't think he was violent.
I just, um...
I can't help but keep wondering what
I should have done differently.
He didn't want to live.
He was not a religious man, you know.
He didn't care for the church. That was me.
I was the one who asked him to come.
I was raised in the church and
I never could quite let it go.
I... I'd be in a strange city, and I would just
go to a church and sit down, you know?
I was the spiritual one.
Thanks.
Yeah. I'll, uh... I'm gonna go get some
boxes. I'll come back for the clothes.
Okay.
Uh, Reverend? Um,
would you... pray with me?
I just... I find it difficult to do it alone.
Just, the words, just don't come.
Are you uncomfortable with me asking you that?
- No. No, no, no. Of course not. Yeah.
- Okay.
Dear Heavenly Father,
we invite you into this room, into our heart...
I held her hand, I spoke,
and the words came out of my mouth.
"By thy words, you shall be justified, and
by thy words, you shall be condemned."
I can no longer ignore my health.
I have postponed my checkup too often.
Yesterday I could literally barely stand.
No, I have not lost my faith.
[AIR HISSING]
[COUGHS]
"And the rich man said I
will pull down my barns,
"and build greater..." [COUGHING]
"And I will say to my soul,
"take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.
"But God said unto his disciples,
take no thought for your life,
"what ye shall eat..."
[LABORED BREATHING]
"Neither for the body, what ye shall put on.
"The life is more than meat,
"and the body is more than raiment."
Thus ends the reading of
the Lord. Praise be God.
When did he come back?
Well, he was out most of Friday.
- So he went to Albany for his checkup?
- I asked him, buy he didn't give me any details.
Uh, you know how he is.
- Perhaps I can check.
- Esther.
It's just...
- I know. I know.
- [SIGHS]
- Okay. All right. Bye.
- See ya.
We'd like to do a gastroscopic exam.
We lower a fiber optic camera down the throat
and esophagus, and take a look around.
It's an outpatient procedure, local anesthetic.
You should be able to leave by mid-afternoon.
Still, that doesn't... that doesn't sound too good.
Well, we'd like to check for
evidence of malignancy.
Cancer.
Cancer's not the fearsome
medical foe it once was.
Mmm-hmm.
What's the... the treatment for that?
It depends on how far advanced the tumor is.
But...
You stated you've been experiencing discomfort.
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Six months?
Well, diet, medication, chemo, even surgery.
We have a variety of diagnostic tools.
Have you had any bloody stools?
Recently?
Okay. I'd like to schedule the
gastroscopy as soon as possible.
We have an open slot... week after next.
Okay.
- What's your diet?
- My diet? Um, I'm hungry, I eat.
- You smoke?
- No.
Drink?
Mmm, in moderation.
That needs to end.
I'm gonna call in a prescription
to help with the stomach pain.
And I want you to take nutritional supplements.
Okay.
Are you in pain now?
No. No. I feel good.
We tend to think that anxiety and worry are
simply an indication of how wise we are,
yet it is a much better indication
of how wicked we are.
Fretting arises from our determination
to have our own way.
Our Lord never worried and was never anxious.
- I'll be back in a bit.
- JEFFERS: Because His purpose was
to accomplish not his own plans...
Reverend?
- Hi Esther.
- I... I didn't know you were coming.
Well, Joel's office called. They want to talk
to me about the Reconsecration program.
Did... did they talk to you?
Uh, I'll be at First Reformed. And Stanley will
be with the full choir here for the simulcast.
- Mmm-hmm. Nice.
- The acoustics will be wonderful.
- I mean...
- Stop.
- Really wonderful. Did you hear from Albany?
- Yeah. I did.
- Well, what did they say?
- Nothing. Just some more tests.
A gastroscopy.
And you know this how?
- I called. I'm worried about you.
- Leave me alone.
- I just want to try...
- I know what you want!
All right? And I cannot bear your concern,
your constant hovering. Your neediness.
You, you're a constant reminder of my own
personal inadequacies and failings.
You want something that
never was and never will be.
- Don't make me do this, 'cause I...
- Esther. Esther. Esther.
- Pull yourself together. Okay? Look at yourself.
- You don't take care of yourself.
I despise you.
I despise what you bring out in me.
Your concerns are petty.
You are a stumbling block.
[SIGHS]
TOLLER: I suddenly feel much better.
I awoke early, clear-headed
and immediately set about my daily tasks.
"The nations raged..."
[TOLLER COUGHING]
"But your wrath came,
"and the time for the dead to be judged,
"and for rewarding your servants,
and prophets and saints,
"and for those who fear your name,
"both small and great,
"and for destroying the
destroyers of the Earth."
Revelations 11:18.
I have removed the previous pages.
They were written in a delirium.
But I am determined to continue.
It's hard to struggle against torpor.
I must set pen to paper.
[KNOCKS ON DOOR]
Shit.
[SIGHS]
- TOLLER: Oh, hey Mary.
- MARY: Hi. Can I come in?
Yeah, of course. Come on in. Come on, come
on. Come on, come in. Do you need anything?
Um, do you want... um, can I take your coat?
- MARY: Yeah.
- Hey, are you all right?
- Um...
- Let me get this.
Uh, no.
I'm just, I'm really frightened. I'm
like I'm frightened of everything.
Uh, I woke up and my heart was pounding
and I... I thought, like, the roof,
the ceiling, was just gonna fall in.
- Um, so I... I had to get out.
- Yeah.
- And I just drove around, and... and I...
- Mary?
- I didn't put any make-up on. Sorry.
- I'm glad you came. Do you want some, uh...
- Some water, some tea...
- Without warning, this dark curtain just fell.
- Uhm, I'm scared of everything.
- Well, you did the right thing coming here.
I just can't stop my thoughts.
They just keep going on and on.
They repeat and repeat.
Did this ever happen before Michael's death?
A little. Yeah. Not like this though.
I read online that, um, they used to believe
that pregnancy made you happy,
but now they feel like
it just makes your feelings more extreme.
Michael...
- He was just really strong.
- How so?
Um, he listened. He was kind.
We used to do this thing called
the Magical Mystery Tour.
It sounds silly. But, um...
We would, uh, share a joint
and lay on top of each other fully clothed.
We would try to get as much "body
to body" contact as possible.
We'd have our hands out and...
We would just look straight
into each other's eyes
and move them in unison,
like right, left, right, left.
And then we would breathe in rhythm.
You want me to do this?
[CHUCKLES]
No. I didn't mean that.
All right.
I mean, I...
Yeah. I mean, yeah. I guess
I... yeah. I guess I did.
Okay. Uh, show me.
Well, you lay on your back,
and with your arms and your legs stretched out.
Do we need music?
No, we just listen to the breaths.
Just lie down?
Yeah. And then, yeah.
[BOTH BREATHING DEEPLY]
[HORNS BLARING]
- Go, go, go, go! Come on, come on, come on!
- Come on, Benny, come on.
Hey, guys. Let's all get seated in the first
pew right here. All the way down.
All right. Good job, guys. Okay, so last
week, we read The Patchwork Path
about the Underground Railroad, which
was not a railroad, but... Rosa?
It was a slave trail.
It was an escape route from
the South to the North.
And this church, First Reformed, was one of
the stops on that route. Reverend Toller?
Yeah. Slaves, uh, fleeing north to Canada
were often helped, fed, hidden by homes
and churches along this route.
Calvin Verlander was the dominee,
the minister here at First Reformed.
And he was very active in
the Abolitionist Movement.
He assisted in...
No. Miss Suriya, let me try this. Uh, why
don't you all stand up for a second?
Take a look right here.
Do you see one part of wood
that seems different
- than the other part of the wood?
- KIDS: Yeah!
You all see that, don't you?
But does this seem a little bit
- like a secret door? Hmm?
- KIDS: Yes.
- Yeah. What's your name?
- Benny.
Benny, will you give me a hand?
- Come on over here.
- Mmm-hmm.
You see, there used to be a pew over this.
And they would move it, and
then they would lift this up.
Can you do it? Help me.
Yes! Oh!
Come around everybody.
Slaves would hide in here. Sometimes whole
families. Be really careful. All right.
Can you imagine that?
In the dark. The air hot,
shaking with fear. The sound of
the slave hunter's horses outside.
On their knees, holding each other's
hands, praying for God to save them?
TOLLER: Do you want me to pack
up anything here in the kitchen?
MARY: No. I can get it later. Thanks.
[SIGHS] I'd love to meet your sister sometime.
- You wanna come to Buffalo?
- If I'm invited.
- I'd love to.
- You gonna visit me?
I would, yeah.
I'd love to meet Michael Jr.
You've been such a help to me.
My great-grandfather... was a pastor in
Muskegon, Michigan. The Saint of God.
And, uh, the bank in town was a two-story
building, the first building to have an elevator.
And one Monday,
Granddad, uh, got the boys all together and
they went into town to deposit church funds,
as they did every Monday. And they
needed to go talk to the managers.
They got on the elevator.
And he had a heart attack.
And he... he... he took off his hat.
Apparently he always wore a hat.
And he took off his hat and he
said, "Boys, take off my shoes.
"I'm standing on Holy Ground."
And then he died.
Somewhere between the first and second floor.
Um, I think about that story
when I think about Michael.
'Cause I believe he was standing
on Holy Ground when he died.
[SIGHS]
Thank you.
So I'll see you in Buffalo?
I think I'm gonna go to the, uh, Reconsecration.
Oh. No, you... you don't need to do that.
- But, I... I want to.
- Yeah, but it's not necessary.
Yeah, but you've been there for me,
and I want to be there for you.
It's very nice of you to offer,
um, but it's just a bunch of rich guys
patting each other on the back.
- But you're gonna be there.
- But I have to be there.
- So I'm gonna go.
- Please don't come.
Okay? I don't want you to
come. You understand?
Okay.
Right. Have a nice evening.
[SIGHS]
"Be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power.
"Put on the full armor of God,

[SIGHS]
Balq Home Products, makers
of paper goods, fertilizers,
everyday items for the household,
was among the first companies to realize the
need to address environmental concerns.
Sir? Are you joining us?
This unit makes recyclable plastic markers.
Balq has facilities or production arrangements
with 18 countries around the world.
TOLLER: Today, I stopped. I had Miso and fish.
Such simple pleasures.
Why do we deny ourselves?
[MEN LAUGHING]
Every act of preservation is an act of creation.
Everything preserved renews creation.
It's how we participate in creation.
I have found another form of prayer.
[KNOCKS ON DOOR]
Reverend Toller. Come on in. Close the door.
Why don't you take a seat?
We're concerned about you.
Who is?
How's your health?
I'm having some tests.
- Hmm? Have you got any results?
- No. No.
What about your diet?
You know, I'm gonna be honest,
you just don't look so good.
I've had some... some stomach issues.
And I understand you've been drinking.
Hm. What? [CHUCKLES] It's
just a little wine with dinner.
- Wine?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Well, that's not recommended for someone
who has stomach problems.
I understand, all right?
I'll... I'll start taking better care of myself.
You're always in the Garden.
Even Jesus wasn't always in the Garden,
on his knees, sweating blood.
He was on the Mount. He was in the
marketplace. He was in the temple.
But you, you're always in the Garden.
For you every hour is the Darkest Hour.
- I wasn't aware that I had offended.
- Jesus doesn't want our suffering.
- He suffered for us.
- Mmm-mmm.
- He wants our commitment and our obedience.
- And what of His creation?
The Heavens declare the glory of God.
God is present everywhere, in every
plant, every river, every tiny insect.
The whole world is a manifestation
of His Holy presence.
I think this is an issue where...
where the church can lead.
But... but they say nothing.
- The...
- [SIGHS]
The U.S. Congress still denies climate change?
Where were we when these
people were elected?
The, the, the... we know who
spoke for big business. Right?
But who spoke for God?
"The creation waits in eager expectation
of liberation from bondage."
That's Romans 8:23. You understand?
So, we should pollute so God can restore?
We should sin so God can forgive? I don't
think that's what the Apostle meant.
I think we're supposed to look
- with the eyes of Jesus into every living...
- You don't live in the real world.
You don't. You, you are a minister at
a tourist church that no one attends.
Do you have any idea what
it takes to do God's work?
- I'm trying to...
- To, to maintain a mission of this size?
The staffing, the outreach, the amount
of people that we touch each day.
The... who's that priest that you like so much?
- Thomas Merton?
- Thomas Merton. He didn't live
- in the real world either!
- Yes, he did! He would...
No. He was a monk who lived in a monastery
in Kentucky and wrote books!
Well, somebody has to do something!
It's the Earth that hangs in the balance.
Well what if this is His plan?
What if we just can't see it?
You think God wants to destroy his creation?
He did once. For 40 days and 40 nights.
Look, Abundant Life, we're
with you. Okay? We care.
We do. And I know, this is
a hard time for you. But...
uh... we're gonna help you with that.
Once we get through the reconsecration service,
you, you need to go to rehab.
You need to go check yourself
into a medical institution.
All right? Maybe go to Nicaragua and
preach the gospel or build houses.
But do something in the real world.
And if you can't do the ceremony,
I'll understand that.
You're expected to be there, but look.
We can just say that you
were sick, which is true.
No. It's not... it's not about the ceremony.
All right? I can... I will... I will...
I... I want to be there. I have to be
there. It's my church. It's 250 years.
I want to be there. I want
to introduce you. Please?
Well, Ed Balq has decided that he
would like to make comments,
so the Governor will introduce him.
- Will that be a problem?
- Not at all. Not at all.
Well good. Good.
Listen. We'll get through this reconsecration.
It'll be special.
And then we'll deal with these other issues.
Thank you.

Jud !
LÃ¨ve-toi !
Le rÃ©veil a sonnÃ©.
J'ai entendu.
- Tu vas Ãªtre en retard.
- Ta gueule !
- Le rÃ©veil est Ã  l'heure.
- Je t'ai dit de la fermer.
Tu m'as fait mal.
- Alors, ferme-la.
- Je le dirai Ã  maman.
Ferme ta gueule !
Mets-moi le rÃ©veil Ã  7 h.
- Fais-le toi-mÃªme.
- Allez, t'es dÃ©jÃ  debout !
Plus de branlette,
on met ses chaussettes !
Salaud ! Parce que t'es obligÃ©
de te lever...
Tu te lÃ¨veras bientÃ´t
en mÃªme temps.
- Des clous !
- Tu ne veux pas ?
Je ne veux pas
bosser Ã  la mine.
OÃ¹ Ã§a, alors ?
J'en sais rien.
Mais pas Ã  la mine.
Je sais pourquoi.
Il faudrait au moins
que tu saches lire et Ã©crire.
Et ils ne prennent pas
les demi-portions.
Ãteins, tu veux ?
Ãteins toi-mÃªme !
Les professeurs
et les Ã©lÃ¨ves
du lycÃ©e de Barnsley
D'aprÃ¨s le roman
Un faucon pour un manant
de Barry Hines
Merde, mon vÃ©lo !
- Je ne t'attendais plus.
- Je suis en retard ?
Presque.
- C'Ã©tait tout juste.
- Pourquoi ?
Jud m'a pris mon vÃ©lo.
- Comment feras-tu ?
- J'irai Ã  pied.
Tu n'auras jamais le temps.
J'y arriverai.
Il y en a qui l'attendent,
cette place.
Des petits gars bien,
pour la plupart.
Je fais mon boulot, non ?
- Pas fameux, comme temps !
- Un peu frais, ce matin.
Un paquet de Players,
s'il vous plaÃ®t.
Deux de dix, Ã§a ira ?
TrÃ¨s bien, merci.
On m'a prÃ©venu,
quand je t'ai engagÃ©,
de bien faire attention.
Tous pareils,
ils voleraient pÃ¨re et mÃ¨re.
Je vous ai encore rien pris.
Je ne t'en ai pas laissÃ© l'occasion.
Ãa fait des annÃ©es
que je ne chaparde plus.
Allez ! Ne reste pas lÃ  Ã  lambiner.
- Ãa va, petit gars ?
- Pas trop mal.
VoilÃ  l'engin qu'il te faudrait.
J'irais plus vite en patinette.
Tu sais ce que je dis toujours ?
Vaut mieux rouler en 3e classe
que marcher en 1re.
T'appelles Ã§a rouler, avec ce clou ?
Un clou ?
C'est un des meilleurs modÃ¨les.
T'es culottÃ© ! Ã demain.
Il fait Ã  peine du 30 Ã  l'heure.
Tu causes trop, toi !
Dan est plus fort que nous.
Mais il tombe.
OÃ¹ veux-tu te battre ?
Ici.
Qu'est-ce qui m'a fait tomber ?
Voici l'occasion...
de lui sauter dessus.
Tu ne m'auras pas.
Un coup Ã  l'estomac
te rÃ©glera ton compte.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
De la graisse !
Le tube !
C'est pour Ã§a que je glissais !
Il a enduit mes semelles
de graisse !
Sale tricheur, je vais t'apprendre !
Attrape Ã§a !
- OÃ¹ a-t-il atterri ?
- Suite au prochain numÃ©ro.
Vous voyez, j'ai fait vite.
Tu as dÃ» en balancer la moitiÃ©.
Non, mais je connais
les raccourcis.
Oui, par les propriÃ©tÃ©s privÃ©es.
Tu sais oÃ¹ il faut ranger le sac.
- C'est l'heure ?
- L'heure d'aller Ã  l'Ã©cole.
Si tard que Ã§a ?
Je ne voudrais pas Ãªtre ton prof.
Attention, M. Porter !
Maladroit ! Tu veux me tuer ?
J'ai perdu l'Ã©quilibre.
Tu en serais capable.
Mon cÅur s'est arrÃªtÃ©.
Asseyez-vous
et reposez-vous un peu.
Ãa va mieux ?
Oui, je suis en pleine forme.
Alors, je me sauve.
Ne sois pas en retard, ce soir.
Absent !
German Bight !
- Tu as parlÃ© ?
- J'ai pas fait exprÃ¨s.
- Qu'as-tu dit ?
- German Bight, monsieur.
Et tu trouves cela drÃ´le ?
Alors pourquoi ?
C'est quand vous avez dit
Fischer...
Ce sont les prÃ©visions
pour la navigation.
Les lieux de pÃªche.
Je les Ã©coute tous les soirs.
Et tu as pensÃ© nous instruire
avec cette remarque idiote ?
Interrompant mon appel !
C'est sorti tout seul.
Comme toi, Casper,
de sous une grande pierre plate.
J'ai dit: silence !
Pas d'autres absents ?
Les filles sont lÃ  ?
C'est l'heure de la priÃ¨re.
En colonne par un !
Taisez-vous !
Ãa voulait dire quoi,
German Bight ?
Ta gueule, j'en ai marre
d'en entendre parler.
On va chercher des nids, demain ?
- Ã quelle heure ?
- Vers 6 h.
Pas plus tard.
Tu viens ?
- OÃ¹ ?
- Chercher des nids.
- Quand ?
- Demain.
- Quelle heure ?
- Vers 6 h.
Je ne peux pas,
j'emmÃ¨ne une fille Ã  Sheffield.
Belle excuse !
Qu'est-ce que tu veux,
Ã  cette heure-ci ?
Dites Ã  Mac de se lever.
Il dort.
Je ne vais pas le rÃ©veiller.
- Allez me le chercher.
- Son pÃ¨re va descendre.
Et aprÃ¨s ?
C'est Mac qu'il me faut.
- Va-t'en, petit voyou.
- RÃ©veillez-le !
Rien Ã  faire, il est trop tÃ´t.
Il dort et il ne bougera pas.
Allez, file !
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Rien !
Alors, sauve-toi !
C'est privÃ©, ici.
Je peux monter au nid
de faucons ?
- Sur le mur.
- Il n'y a rien. Va-t'en !
Mais je les ai vus sortir.
Et alors,
tu veux prendre leurs Åufs ?
- Il n'y en a pas, ils ont Ã©clos.
- Inutile d'y monter, alors.
Et d'en bas ? Je n'ai jamais vu
de nid de faucon.
Allez, viens !
Dans ce trou !
Il y a des annÃ©es qu'il est lÃ .
- Je n'en savais rien.
- Peu de gens le savent.
Je l'ai observÃ© du bois.
Il va sur le poteau
puis il fonce sur sa proie
et l'apporte Ã  ses petits.
On voulait dÃ©molir le mur.
Il est dangereux.
J'Ã©vite qu'elle joue Ã  cÃ´tÃ©.
J'aimerais bien
en dresser un jeune.
On peut les dresser.
Tu sais t'y prendre ?
Et vous ?
Il faut savoir en prendre soin.
C'est vraiment risquÃ©.
- Vous connaissez quelqu'un ?
- Oui.
Mais mieux vaut les laisser tranquilles,
c'est dur de les dresser.
OÃ¹ pourrais-je me renseigner ?
Ã la bibliothÃ¨que municipale,
ils ont des livres.
- OÃ¹ est-ce ?
- En ville.
Vous Ãªtes inscrit ?
- Comment Ã§a ?
- Vous Ãªtes membre ?
Je voudrais un livre
sur la fauconnerie.
Seul un membre
peut prendre un livre.
Je n'en veux qu'un seul.
Vous avez rempli le formulaire ?
Alors, rien Ã  faire !
Il faudra le faire signer
par votre pÃ¨re.
Il est parti.
Attendez qu'il revienne.
Je veux dire... il nous a quittÃ©s.
Alors faites-le signer
par votre mÃ¨re.
Elle rentrera tard
et demain c'est dimanche.
Rien ne presse ?
J'en prendrai soin.
Je ne l'abÃ®merai pas.
Vos mains sont dÃ©goÃ»tantes.
Nos livres seront sales.
Je n'en lis pas de sales.
J'espÃ¨re bien !
Vous Ãªtes trop jeune pour Ã§a.
Ma mÃ¨re connaÃ®t quelqu'un
qui travaille ici.
Ãa ne servira Ã  rien.
Il faut la signature d'un adulte
figurant sur la liste Ã©lectorale.
- J'ai plus de 21 ans.
- SÃ»rement pas.
Et je vote.
Vous n'avez pas l'Ã¢ge.
Je vote pour ma mÃ¨re
qui ne vote pas.
Il faudra attendre.
On trouve ce livre
chez un libraire ?
Oui. Un peu plus bas dans la rue.
Je cherche l'autobiographie
de NoÃ«l Coward:
Indicatif prÃ©sent.
Si encore tu savais lire.
Rends-le-moi !
Que veux-tu savoir
sur la fauconnerie ?
Donne-moi Ã§a !
- OÃ¹ as-tu dÃ©gotÃ© Ã§a ?
- On me l'a prÃªtÃ©.
Dis plutÃ´t que tu l'as chipÃ©.
OÃ¹ Ã§a ?
Une librairie en ville.
T'es dingue ! Du fric,
je comprends, mais un bouquin...
Regarde ce que tu as fait.
J'y tiens, Ã  ce livre.
Qu'est-ce que Ã§a te donnera ?
Je vais dresser un faucon.
Tu ne pourrais pas
dresser une puce.
Et oÃ¹ trouveras-tu un faucon ?
- J'ai trouvÃ© un nid.
- C'est pas vrai.
- Comme tu veux.
- OÃ¹ Ã§a ?
- Je te le dirai pas.
- OÃ¹ Ã§a ?
- Tu me fais mal.
- OÃ¹ c'est ?
Ã la ferme du monastÃ¨re.
Tu as failli me casser le bras.
J'irai lÃ -bas avec le vieux fusil.
Je le dirai au fermier.
Quel rapport ?
Il les protÃ¨ge.
Les faucons sont une calamitÃ©.
Ils bouffent les poules.
Oui, ils emportent
mÃªme les vaches.
T'es spirituel !
Tu dis des bÃªtises,
ils sont trop petits.
Ils bouffent des souris,
des petits oiseaux.
Je vais voir un oiseau, ce soir.
Sans plumes...
ou pas partout !
Tu as dÃ®nÃ©, Billy ?
Sers-toi.
Tu sais oÃ¹ est le garde-manger.
Tes chevaux, Ã§a a marchÃ© ?
Pas mal. Deux gagnants.
Pas possible !
Alors, tu m'invites ce soir ?
Tu as dÃ©jÃ  quelqu'un.
Tais-toi !
Et ne rentre pas encore ivre-mort.
Pourquoi, tu auras de la visite ?
Tu plaisantes ?
Je ne suis pas comme toi.
Faut voir avec qui tu sors,
ces temps-ci !
C'est mieux que ton infirme.
Reg ? Il n'est pas infirme.
Il le sera s'il vient ici.
Au moins, mes copains
ne sont pas grippe-sous.
Tu peux parler ! Tu as le geste
aussi large qu'un Ãcossais manchot.
Et lui, il lui faut un cric
pour lui arracher un sou.
C'est parce qu'il te connaÃ®t.
SerrÃ© comme le cul d'un chameau
dans une tempÃªte de sable.
Attention ! Tu pourrais
t'attirer des ennuis.
- Et prendre une trempe.
- Il ne peut pas.
Tu pourrais avoir des surprises.
Et Ãªtre frappÃ© par la foudre aussi.
Tais-toi !
J'en ai marre !
Chaque fois que je veux sortir,
c'est pareil.
J'en suis toute retournÃ©e.
Pour qui tu te prends ?
Tu te crois tout permis.
T'es pas encore chez toi, ici.
Ãa viendra bien un jour, non ?
- Moi vivante, jamais !
- C'est bien ce que je dis.
J'en ai assez, Jud.
Je me tue au travail
et quand je veux sortir,
le samedi...
J'ai plus envie d'y aller.
On se passera de toi.
Mais toi, tu vas y aller,
bien sÃ»r.
Oui !
Je suis beau garÃ§on,
tu dois l'admettre.
Ma nana a de la chance.
Il se croit sorti
de la cuisse de Jupiter.
Tu me paies un brandy, ce soir ?
Amuse-toi bien !
Elles auraient gagnÃ© Ã  Ãªtre cirÃ©es.
Tant pis, il fera nuit bientÃ´t.
Que vas-tu faire, ce soir ?
Lire mon livre.
DÃ©jÃ  7 h !
Je vais Ãªtre en retard.
Tiens, prends 2 shillings,
mon chou.
AchÃ¨te-toi des frites.
Ne te couche pas trop tard.
Bonsoir.
On s'amuse
mais il arrive un moment
oÃ¹ il faut se ranger des voitures.
Il faut rÃ©flÃ©chir.
Rien ne presse.
Ãa dÃ©pend de ce que tu cherches.
J'aime rentrer,
me mettre Ã  table...
prendre un bain,
me changer et sortir.
Quand on s'est trompÃ© une fois,
on n'est pas tranquille, tu sais.
On hÃ©site avant de se remarier.
Si elle prÃ©fÃ¨re prendre un autre...
Elle a l'Ã¢ge
de savoir ce qu'elle veut.
On ne sait jamais avec Billy.
Je me demande parfois ce qu'il fera.
S'il avait un...
S'il avait Ã©tÃ©
d'un milieu diffÃ©rent,
il s'en serait peut-Ãªtre sorti.
Pour le moment,
c'est un cas dÃ©sespÃ©rÃ©.
Je suis trÃ¨s bien comme je suis.
Mes gosses n'ont rien.
Que feront-ils ?
Qui sait si Jud
voulait Ãªtre mineur ?
Je crois qu'Ã  mon Ã¢ge, Reg...
et avec deux gosses,
on a envie d'un vrai foyer...
et de quelqu'un
qui rentre le soir
et dont il faut s'occuper.
Moi, par exemple ?
Tu n'es pas mariÃ© avec moi.
Donne-moi un baiser !
T'es dingue !
ArrÃªte, t'as encore trop bu.
- Mais non !
- Si !
T'as amenÃ© l'infirme ?
La ferme ! Tais-toi !
Tu te souviens,
quand tu t'es mariÃ©e ?
Il attachait les confettis
avec des Ã©lastiques.
Laisse-le !
S'il cherche la bagarre, il l'aura.
Il y a un type dans le quartier
Dont j'aimerais vous parler
Il cultive en cachette
Une Ã©norme courgette
Il en fit Ã©talage
Ã une dame trÃ¨s sage
Quand elle vit ce morceau
Elle cria en sursaut:
Quel est ce colosse ?
Je n'en ai jamais vu de si grosse
Elle est vraiment Ã©norme
Elle dÃ©passe toutes les normes
Et avec Ã§a, l'air parfaite
Toute jolie et rondelette
C'est elle la plus merveilleuse
On voit bien qu'elle est juteuse
Quel est ce colosse ?
Je n'en ai jamais vu de si grosse
Billy, tu dors ?
Aide-moi Ã  retirer mon pantalon !
Allez ! Je ne vais pas attendre
toute la nuit.
Ce petit jeu a assez durÃ©.
Tous les samedis, c'est pareil.
Reste tranquille !
Allez, dors.
EspÃ¨ce de cochon !
Sale porc !
Infect bÃ¢tard !
T'aimes pas
qu'on t'appelle bÃ¢tard ?
BÃ¢tard !
Cochon !
Sale porc !
Ivrogne ! BÃ¢tard !
Trois bons repas pendant 15 jours.
Un morceau de viande entre le pouce
et l'index de la main gantÃ©e.
Le faucon se penchera
et attrapera la viande
avec son bec.
DÃ¨s que le faucon aura appris
Ã  l'intÃ©rieur,
on essayera sur un piquet
Ã  l'extÃ©rieur.
Alors qu'il venait au premier appel,
il est probable qu'il refusera.
Il regardera, craintif,
autour de lui
sans prÃªter attention
Ã  la viande ou au poing.
Quand il rÃ©pondra Ã  l'appel,
on le lÃ¢chera sur de plus grandes
distances grÃ¢ce Ã  une crÃ©ance
qui l'empÃªche de s'enfuir.
Avec une crÃ©ance,
il n'essaiera pas de s'envoler.
Viens !
Kes !
Viens !
PrÃ©parez-vous !
Tu tires encore au flanc ?
Non. M. et Mme Barbington
m'ont parlÃ©.
Ãa a dÃ» te stimuler, non ?
Comment Ã§a ?
La conversation.
Qu'est-ce que tu crois ?
Un stimulateur ?
Stimulant, imbÃ©cile !
DÃ©pÃªche-toi !
Tu as dÃ©jÃ  15 jours de retard.
Descendez avant que
je n'aille vous chercher.
Casper !
Tu n'es pas en tenue ?
Je n'ai pas de tenue.
J'en ai marre !
Ã chaque leÃ§on, le mÃªme refrain:
pas de tenue !
Ã chaque leÃ§on depuis 4 ans,
tu as empruntÃ©,
tu t'es esquivÃ©, tu as barbotÃ©.
Tu es le seul
Ã  ne pas avoir une tenue.
Maman dit que c'est inutile
puisque je pars.
Ãa fait 4 ans que tu dois partir ?
Tu aurais pu t'en payer une.
- Je n'aime pas le football.
- Ãa n'a rien Ã  voir.
Je n'ai pas
assez d'argent de poche.
Trouve-toi un boulot !
J'en ai un.
On te paie, non ?
Je dois tout donner Ã  maman...
Attention
Ã  ne pas t'attirer d'ennuis !
Je n'en ai pas eu
depuis la derniÃ¨re fois.
Je vais te trouver une tenue.
- T'as gagnÃ©, Casper.
- Ta gueule !
Mets Ã§a.
- Ãa ne me va pas.
- Tu rentres dedans, non ?
- Oui.
- Alors, il te va !
Tu les auras au chaud.
EnlÃ¨ve ton caleÃ§on.
Je n'en porte pas.
Cache-les, on les voit !
Un vrai Tarzan !
Il revient du Biafra.
Remonte-le, Casper.
Comme ceci ?
Enroule-le !
Tu es trop con pour Ãªtre drÃ´le.
Allez, Ã§a ira !
DÃ©pÃªchez-vous.
On a assez perdu de temps.
Je vais vous montrer
comment on joue.
Ãa vaut le coup.
Attention, Casper !
Prends garde, Crossley.
Allez-y !
Descendez de lÃ  !
Ou je vais vous chercher.
Tibutt, tu seras le capitaine
de l'autre Ã©quipe.
Allez, alignez-vous !
Ã moi de choisir !
Vous allez prendre les meilleurs.
Tu prÃ©fÃ¨res faire des maths ?
Je suis dÃ©jÃ  gelÃ©.
J'hÃ©rite de toi.
Tiens-le, qu'il ne tombe pas.
Bon...
on va jouer
avec le vent dans le dos.
Paget, tu joues inter.
Vous Ãªtes qui aujourd'hui,
Liverpool ?
Regarde les maillots.
Manchester United.
Vous jouez Dennis Law ?
Non, Charlton.
Il fait trop froid.
Charlton est moins rapide, non ?
Tu veux m'apprendre Ã  jouer ?
En plus,
le maillot de Law est au sale.
On n'a pas de gardien.
- Qui est gardien de but ?
- Casper.
Casper, oÃ¹ joues-tu ?
Je ne sais pas. Inter gauche.
LÃ , derriÃ¨re ?
Tu seras gardien de but.
Je sais pas jouer.
Tu apprendras. En place !
Nous sommes Manchester United.
Et vous ?
Nous serons Spurs.
Bon ! Manchester United
contre Spurs,
dans le quart de finale
Ã  Old Trafford.
C'est le blond Charlton qui engage.
Allez !
Ã quoi joues-tu ?
Tu aurais dÃ» courir,
je te l'ai passÃ©.
OÃ¹ sont les autres ?
Jamais vu une nouille pareille !
- Pourquoi Ã§a ?
- C'est mou, mon garÃ§on !
Ben je suis propre...
PÃ©nalitÃ©.
Pour qui te prends-tu, Bremner ?
Je n'y suis pour rien.
C'est moi qui vais shooter.
Personne ne bouge !
Regarde Ã§a, Guthrie !
Ãa va, Clegg ?
Tu as bougÃ© !
RamÃ¨ne le ballon.
PÃ©nalitÃ© !
DerriÃ¨re la ligne !
Il a bougÃ© !
J'ai pas bougÃ©.
La dÃ©cision de l'arbitre
est sans appel.
Fallait rÃ©ussir le premier.
Les garÃ§ons,
prenez-en de la graine.
Regarde d'un cÃ´tÃ©
et shoote de l'autre.
Charlton a Ã©galisÃ©
pour Manchester United.
Le score est: un but partout.
Gros lard !
Va te faire foutre !
Gros plein de soupe !
Qu'est-ce que tu as dit ?
- Rien !
- Dehors ! Au vestiaire !
J'ai rien dit.
Je ne peux pas admettre Ã§a.
Ce n'est pas juste.
C'est notre capitaine.
Ãa m'est Ã©gal.
Il n'a qu'Ã  jouer correctement.
Au vestiaire !
Va prendre ta douche !
Ce n'est pas juste.
Pas un capitaine.
On n'expulse pas un capitaine.
Tu te prends pour un singe ?
Donnez-lui une banane.
Descends, ou Ã§a va chauffer.
Merci. Et voici le tour suivant...
Je vais t'en montrer un !
Retourne au but !
Reprenez vos places.
Ãa fait mal.
Il est dur comme du fer.
On dirait une pierre.
Je gÃ¨le !
J'ai les pieds gelÃ©s.
Et les genoux, regarde...
ils sont tout pÃ¢les.
DrÃ´le de couleur !
J'aurais dÃ» Ãªtre dispensÃ©.
Un but formidable !
Je vais te montrer.
C'est un beau quart de finale.
Je t'en donnerai,
du quart de finale.
- Vous avez encore perdu ?
- Mon survÃªtement !
Vous n'avez pas eu de chance.
C'est Ã©cÅurant !
Tu es pressÃ©, Casper ?
Je dois rentrer chez moi.
- Tu n'as rien oubliÃ© ?
- Non.
- Tu en es sÃ»r ?
- Oui.
- Et la douche ?
- C'est fait.
Demandez-leur !
C'est ce que je vais faire.
- Tu l'as vu prendre sa douche ?
- Non.
- Et toi ?
- Non plus.
Il a pris une douche ?
- Qui Ã§a ?
- Casper ?
- Quand ?
- Ã l'instant.
Une douche ?
Casper a-t-il pris une douche ?
Ne fais pas l'idiot.
- A-t-il pris une douche ?
- Je ne crois pas.
Speed, si tu continues,
gare Ã  toi.
Personne ne t'a vu.
Tu n'as pas pris ta douche !
Maman ne veut pas.
Qu'a-t-elle dit, ta maman ?
Je ne dois pas en prendre,
je suis enrhumÃ©.
Ta mÃ¨re a fait un mot ?
Je vous l'apporterai.
Il me le faut maintenant.
"Tout Ã©lÃ¨ve dÃ©sirant Ãªtre
dispensÃ© de la douche
"doit fournir au prÃ©alable
"une lettre d'explication cachetÃ©e,
"signÃ©e par ses parents
ou son tuteur."
- Laissez-moi rentrer.
- Tu peux partir.
Mais aprÃ¨s la douche.
Je n'ai pas de serviette.
- Emprunte-la.
- Impossible.
Tu sÃ©cheras comme Ã§a.
Allez !
Venez ici, MacDowell !
Mon chien m'a mordu.
Votre chien !
On a jouÃ© ensemble, hier soir.
Il doit porter des bas.
- Encore pressÃ© ?
- Je peux partir ?
Pas avant d'Ãªtre lavÃ©.
Mais Ã§a y est !
Je me suis lavÃ©.
Oui, vous deux !
Vous allez me le surveiller.
Restez ici et veillez
Ã  ce qu'il ne sorte pas.
Elle est froide !
Remue-toi !
Ãa te rafraÃ®chira,
aprÃ¨s tes prouesses.
C'est pas juste.
Je vais attraper un rhume.
C'est pas juste.
Et le but que tu as laissÃ©
entrer exprÃ¨s ?
- On peut aller servir ?
- Non, restez lÃ  !
- On est de service.
- Je m'en fous.
Qu'ils se servent eux-mÃªmes,
pour une fois.
Je ne vaux rien dans les buts.
Tu auras l'occasion d'apprendre.
On le laisse sortir ?
Il va attraper froid.
- Ou une pneumonie.
- Ãa m'est Ã©gal.
Je ne vais pas me crever
pendant 90 minutes
pour qu'il me sabote mon jeu.
On va rater le dÃ©jeuner.
- Alors, Ã§a marche ?
- C'est pÃ©nible !
Une journÃ©e pareille,
Ã§a vous remonte le moral !
Et moi, je vais descendre.

"Si un homme a 100 brebis
et qu'une d'elles vienne Ã  s'Ã©garer,
"ne va-t-il pas laisser
les 99 autres
"et aller chercher
la brebis Ã©garÃ©e ?
"Et s'il parvient Ã  la retrouver,
"il en a plus de joie
"que des qui ne sont pas Ã©garÃ©es."
"On ne veut pas,
chez votre PÃ¨re qui est aux cieux,
"qu'un seul de ces petits
se perde."
C'est tout pour aujourd'hui.
ArrÃªtez de tousser.
Tous les matins, c'est pareil.
Toussez oÃ¹ vous voulez,
mais pas ici.
Ce n'est pas un dÃ©potoir, ici,
mais un lieu de recueillement.
Venez lÃ  !
Montrez-vous !
Qui a toussÃ© ?
M. Hasketh,
c'Ã©tait prÃ¨s de vous.
Amenez-moi ce garÃ§on !
MacDowell,
c'est vous qui avez toussÃ©.
- Non.
- Si ! Je vous ai entendu.
Ne discutez pas.
Chez le proviseur !
Je m'en doutais.
Allez m'attendre Ã  mon bureau.
- C'Ã©tait pas moi.
- Que Dieu vous protÃ¨ge !
Nous allons prier.
Joignez les mains, fermez les yeux.
Notre PÃ¨re...
- Il mord ?
- Il a failli blesser un gosse.
Tu l'attaches avec du fil de fer ?
Oui, sinon il arrache tout.
Il a foncÃ© sur le gosse.
Donc tu portes un gant ?
Oui, pour me protÃ©ger.
- Tu l'appelles comment ?
- Kes.
C'est un bel oiseau.
Moi, Ã§a me dirait rien.
LÃ¨ve-toi !
Tu dormais, n'est-ce pas ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Je le sais, moi. Tu dormais !
Tu ne dormais pas,
espÃ¨ce de voyou ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Moi si.
Tu traÃ®nes dans la rue, la nuit,
au lieu d'Ãªtre au lit.
Tu viendras
dans mon bureau aprÃ¨s.
Voici les avis:
un employÃ© du Service
de Placement des Jeunes
reÃ§oit cet aprÃ¨s-midi
ceux qui vont quitter l'Ã©cole.
On aurait dÃ» prÃ©venir vos parents,
mais s'ils veulent le rencontrer,
consultez l'horaire sur le tableau
pour un entretien.
Enfin,
en ce qui concerne les 3 membres
du Club des Fumeurs
pris en flagrant dÃ©lit
derriÃ¨re la salle de jeux,
ils se retrouveront avec moi
dans un instant
et pourront se mettre Ã  jour
de leurs cotisations.
S'il me frappe,
j'irai chercher mon pÃ¨re.
Pour quoi faire ?
Il ne fait rien quand il vient.
- Comment Ã§a ?
- Il se fait taper sur les doigts.
Ta gueule. On t'a assez entendu.
Tout le monde s'est moquÃ© de lui.
- RÃ©pÃ¨te !
- C'est vrai.
T'as rien Ã  dire sur mon pÃ¨re.
Moi, il ne me frappera pas.
- Que veux-tu ?
- Un message de Mme Spooner.
Fais la queue !
Il adore Ã§a, vous faire attendre.
Il peut me garder jusqu'Ã  4 h.
J'aime mieux Ã§a que les devoirs.
Viens lÃ , toi !
Garde-nous Ã§a
jusqu'Ã  ce qu'on ressorte.
Il va croire que je fume.
S'il les trouvait sur nous,
il triplerait la dose.
- J'en veux pas.
- Tu veux un coup de poing ?
Tu les prends ?
T'as intÃ©rÃªt Ã  accepter.
Mais si je me fais choper,
j'aurai quelque chose ?
Oui.
Ma main sur la gueule !
Le voilÃ .
En colonne par un !
Tu es perdu, mon garÃ§on ?
Retourne en classe !
Vous, entrez.
Les mÃªmes tÃªtes !
Toujours les mÃªmes !
Cette Ã©cole est ouverte
depuis 10 ans.
AprÃ¨s chaque AssemblÃ©e,
des Ã©lÃ¨ves viennent ici.
Toujours les mÃªmes !
J'ai un message...
Ne m'interromps pas.
Ferme la porte !
Depuis 30 ans,
j'enseigne dans cette ville.
J'ai eu vos parents comme Ã©lÃ¨ves.
Ton pÃ¨re, MacDowell.
Dans la vieille Ã©cole sordide,
avant qu'ils ne construisent
celle-ci,
cette Ã©cole magnifique !
Mais les choses
ne sont pas mieux qu'avant.
Je ne comprends pas
cette gÃ©nÃ©ration.
Je croyais comprendre les jeunes,
fort de mon expÃ©rience.
Mais vous... non !
Ãa me paraÃ®t un gaspillage d'argent
et une perte de temps.
Comme de vous parler, lÃ .
Tu n'Ã©coutes mÃªme pas, MacDowell ?
Non ! Croesland, toi non plus ?
Aucun n'Ã©coute.
Ãa se voit sur vos visages.
Vous Ãªtes la gÃ©nÃ©ration
qui n'Ã©coute pas.
On ne peut jamais rien vous dire.
Vous Ãªtes sophistiquÃ©s
avec votre musique et votre tenue.
Ce n'est que superficiel,
c'est un vernis.
Il n'y a rien de solide,
de valable en dessous.
Comment le sais-je ?
Aucun progrÃ¨s en discipline
ou en correction,
en moralitÃ© ou en conduite.
Je le sais
car je dois encore utiliser ceci
tous les jours.
En 1920 ou 1930,
c'Ã©tait comprÃ©hensible.
Les temps Ã©taient durs
mais on forgeait des qualitÃ©s
que vous n'aurez jamais.
En ville,
je rencontre parfois des anciens
qui Ã©voquent le bon vieux temps.
Nous rions des coups
que je leur ai infligÃ©s.
Que me donnerez-vous ?
Un coup de klaxon
d'un jeune boutonneux
au volant d'une voiture d'occasion.
Je ne sais pas.
Je ne sais vraiment pas.
Pas de cran, pas de tripes !
Rien pour vous racheter.
Des moutons pour les media.
Donc,
tant qu'on n'aura pas
de meilleure solution,
j'utiliserai cette baguette,
sachant parfaitement bien
que vous recommencerez.
Encore et toujours !
Vous sortirez d'ici,
les mains douloureuses,
mais cesserez-vous de fumer ?
Vivement la pause
pour en griller une !
- Tu souris ?
- Non, monsieur.
Je parie que tu y songes dÃ©jÃ .
Videz vos poches !
Elles doivent Ãªtre pleines
de cigarettes. Videz-les !
Silence ! Vide tes poches !
- Vous ne comprenez pas...
- Allez !
C'est rÃ©pugnant !
Toi ! Encore toi.
Vide tes poches.
J'ai un message de...
Tes poches !
C'est Ã  ne pas croire !
Je ne peux le croire.
Vide tes poches ! Allez !
Une vraie petite fabrique !
Jetez-moi Ã§a !
Que Ã§a vous serve de leÃ§on !
Mais j'en doute.
Avant la fin de la semaine,
vous serez de nouveau ici
pour le mÃªme motif: fumer.
Si seulement pour une fois,
vous pouviez comprendre.
C'est votre argent
que vous gaspillez
et ce sont vos mains qui trinquent.
Voici les gladiateurs.
- OÃ¹ Ã©tiez-vous ?
- Chez M. Gryce.
La baguette ?
- Combien de coups ?
- Deux !
- Ãa vous a fait mal ?
- Assez !
Pas trop, j'espÃ¨re.
Allez vous asseoir.
Bon, parlons des faits.
Ann,
qu'est-ce qu'un fait ?
Ne me citez pas en exemple
que Guthrie a les cheveux hirsutes.
Un fait est quelque chose
de prouvÃ©, une vÃ©ritÃ©.
Quelque chose
qui est vraiment arrivÃ©...
est un fait.
Tout le monde a compris ?
Tibutt,
tiens-toi droit !
Qu'on le regarde,
mÃªme si ce n'est pas plaisant,
et qu'on me donne
des faits Ã  son sujet.
Il sort avec des filles, la nuit.
Vraiment ?
Il fume.
- Des clous !
- Tu fumes !
Ãcrase-toi !
Ce qu'il fait au-dehors
m'importe peu,
tant qu'il ne vient pas ici
la cigarette au bec.
D'accord ?
Alors, vous Ãªtes tous
dans la lune ?
Ã toi, Julie.
Songe Ã  un Ã©vÃ©nement
qui t'est arrivÃ©,
rÃ©ellement, et qui intÃ©resserait
tes camarades.
Nous Ã©tions Ã  une boum hier soir.
Vers 3 h du matin,
on dansait dans le jardin,
moi et les autres,
Pam et Sheila.
Une voisine est venue
pour nous demander
de faire moins de bruit.
Elle a menacÃ© d'appeler la police.
Nous, on a dit:
appelez-la si vous voulez.
Elle l'a appelÃ©e.
C'est rÃ©ellement arrivÃ©.
Quelqu'un d'autre ?
Toi, Casper ?
Tu n'Ã©coutais pas ?
De quoi avons-nous parlÃ© ?
- D'histoires.
- Quel genre d'histoires ?
Tu n'as rien retenu ?
- Si, un peu.
- Un peu !
LÃ¨ve-toi.
Raconte-nous une histoire vÃ©cue.
- Je n'en connais pas.
- Cherche, sinon tu ne bougeras pas.
Il y a toujours quelqu'un
qui ne veut rien entendre,
quoi qu'on fasse.
Comme toi, Casper.
Je te donne 2 minutes.
Trouve ou toute la classe
reviendra Ã  4 h.
Reste pas plantÃ©
comme une andouille.
C'est une andouille.
Vas-y, raconte !
Parle du faucon !
Le prochain qui crie
va le regretter.
Il a un faucon et il en est dingue.
Il ne voit personne.
Il passe son temps avec son faucon.
Il l'adore.
C'est mieux que toi !
Parle-nous de ce faucon.
- OÃ¹ l'as-tu eu ?
- Je l'ai trouvÃ©.
Dans les bois.
- OÃ¹ est-il ?
- Dans une remise.
Que lui donnes-tu Ã  manger ?
De la viande,
des souris, des oiseaux.
C'est cruel de le garder enfermÃ©.
Je le fais voler tous les jours.
Et il ne s'enfuit pas ?
Oh non ! Je l'ai dressÃ©.
Raconte-nous.
Comment l'as-tu dressÃ© ?
Il faut Ãªtre trÃ¨s patient.
Le nourrir quand il a faim
et le dresser Ã  ce moment-lÃ .
Il porte une longe tout le temps.
- Une quoi ?
- Une longe.
Comment Ã§a s'Ã©crit ?
Viens nous montrer.
Viens l'Ã©crire au tableau.
Je ne connaissais pas ce mot.
Qui le connaÃ®t ? Levez la main !
Personne. Ãcris-le.
Explique-nous ce que c'est.
C'est une courroie
attachÃ©e Ã  ses pattes.
Quand je tiens l'oiseau,
elle descend de ma main Ã  la filiÃ¨re.
Ãcris-le au tableau.
Cela forme une laisse.
Inscris-le aussi.
Je l'ai d'abord nourri de ma main,
et une fois habituÃ©, avec le gant.
AprÃ¨s, j'ai Ã©loignÃ© la viande.
Comme ceci.
Il devait sauter pour l'attraper
et je pouvais reculer ma main.
LÃ¨ve la main pour montrer.
J'ai Ã©cartÃ© ma main
de plus en plus.
Puis je l'ai fait avec la longe.
Il lui faut de l'eau
comme Ã  un oiseau en cage ?
Pour se baigner.
Il se baigne trÃ¨s tÃ´t le matin.
Tu le nourris
combien de fois par jour ?
Au dÃ©but, 3 ou 4 fois,
pour l'engraisser.
Ãa paraÃ®t passionnant.
Fallait voir la premiÃ¨re fois
oÃ¹ je l'ai lÃ¢chÃ©.
Ãa vous intÃ©resse ?
Continue.
J'utilisais la crÃ©ance
depuis deux semaines
et il s'envolait Ã  30 ou 40 mÃ¨tres.
Dans le bouquin,
ils disent qu'Ã  ce stade,
il peut commencer
Ã  voler librement.
Je voulais le faire dÃ©jÃ ,
mais je n'osais pas.
J'avais peur qu'il se sauve.
Ãa a bien durÃ© quatre ou cinq jours.
Je le remettais toujours
au lendemain.
Enfin, j'ai dÃ©cidÃ©:
je le lÃ¢cherai demain.
Ce soir-lÃ , c'Ã©tait un vendredi,
j'ai Ã©vitÃ© de le gaver
pour qu'il soit en forme.
Je suis allÃ© me coucher,
mais je n'ai pas fermÃ© l'Åil
de la nuit.
J'avais peur qu'il s'envole.
Le matin, je me suis dit:
s'il doit partir, il partira !
Je n'y peux rien.
J'ai retirÃ© la crÃ©ance
et il a sautÃ© sur un piquet.
Rien ne le retenait,
il pouvait s'envoler.
Il n'avait plus que la longe.
J'ai cru qu'il allait partir,
mais il ne l'a pas fait.
J'Ã©tais terrifiÃ©.
Il Ã©tait lÃ 
et il est parti dans le champ.
Il regardait autour de lui.
Quand je suis arrivÃ©
Ã  60 mÃ¨tres environ,
je l'ai appelÃ©.
Il n'a pas bougÃ©.
Je voulais aller le reprendre,
quand tout Ã  coup,
je l'ai vu voler.
Il est arrivÃ© comme un obus.
Au ras du sol, comme un Ã©clair.
Les ailes ne faisaient aucun bruit.
En plein sur le gant !
Et il a demandÃ© sa viande.
J'Ã©tais si content
que je ne savais que faire.
J'ai dÃ©cidÃ© de recommencer,
pour Ãªtre plus sÃ»r.
Je l'ai ramenÃ© au piquet.
Je suis retournÃ© au milieu du champ
et je l'ai rappelÃ©.
Il est revenu de nouveau,
droit sur le gant.
Je l'avais dressÃ©.
C'est tout ce que je pouvais faire.
Tu en as bien fait assez.
Bravo, Billy. On t'applaudit.
Tu en as une, Casper ?
T'en as jamais.
Tu tapes les autres.
Casper le Tapeur, Ã§a t'irait bien.
- C'est pas Ã  toi que j'en donnerais.
- Je vais te montrer.
OÃ¹ vas-tu ?
T'aimes pas la compagnie ?
Pas comme ta mÃ¨re...
Tu les collectionnes, les oncles !
- Ta gueule, sinon...
- Essaie !
T'oserais pas dire Ã§a Ã  Jud.
Ton Jud, c'est zÃ©ro !
C'est un vrai caÃ¯d, oui.
- J'en connais de plus forts.
- Qui Ã§a, ton pÃ¨re ?
Ton frÃ¨re ? Mon Åil !
Qu'est-ce qu'il est ?
Ma sÅur ?
Il ne s'appelle mÃªme pas Casper.
C'est mon frÃ¨re !
On habite ensemble, non ?
Vous avez dix secondes
pour disparaÃ®tre.
Un... deux...
Venez par ici, vous deux !
- Alors ?
- C'est lui qui a commencÃ©.
- Il m'a lancÃ© du charbon.
- Tais-toi.
Toujours pareil !
C'est l'autre qui est fautif.
Regardez dans quel Ã©tat vous Ãªtes.
Casper, tu n'en mourras pas.
Sauf si je m'en charge.
Tu as un adversaire
Ã  ta taille, hein ?
Choisis-en un plus grand !
Si j'en faisais autant,
tu me traiterais de brute, hein ?
Tu aurais raison.
Je suis plus grand et plus fort.
- J'appellerais mon pÃ¨re.
- Et moi, le mien !
Il est champion du monde
poids lourd.
Il aurait bonne mine, ton pÃ¨re !
C'est Ã§a, se faire engueuler.
Ãa ne te plaÃ®t pas ?
Ãa te plaira encore moins
si tu recommences, tu as compris ?
Rangez-moi ce tas !
Tu as fumÃ© ?
Tu as fumÃ©, Ã§a se sent.
Tu viendras me voir aprÃ¨s.
Que s'est-il passÃ© ?
Il a insultÃ© ma famille
et ils se sont moquÃ©s de moi.
Bon, bon, calme-toi !
Ils s'en prennent toujours Ã  toi.
Pourquoi ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Tu es mÃ©chant ?
Ãa m'arrive.
Mais pas Ã  ce point-lÃ .
Il y en a de pires que moi
qui s'en tirent trÃ¨s bien.
Qu'en penses-tu ?
Il y a bien une raison, non ?
Prenez ce matin, par exemple.
Je me suis endormi,
mais je ne faisais rien de mal.
Je m'Ã©tais levÃ© Ã  6 h
pour les journaux.
Et je suis passÃ© voir mon faucon
avant l'Ã©cole.
- Ãa fatigue, Ã§a.
- De quoi Ãªtre Ã©puisÃ©.
On ne devrait pas Ãªtre battu
pour Ã§a.
Mais on ne peut pas dire Ã§a
Ã  M. Gryce.
Et le petit avec son message
a Ã©tÃ© battu aussi.
Ãa n'a rien de drÃ´le.
AprÃ¨s, il a Ã©tÃ© malade comme un chien.
Les professeurs
ne s'occupent pas de nous.
Si on a de mauvaises notes,
c'est qu'on est des abrutis.
Ils n'attendent qu'une chose:
la fin de la leÃ§on.
On ne les intÃ©resse pas
et c'est rÃ©ciproque.
Et chez toi, tout va bien ?
Oui. Comme d'habitude.
Plus d'ennuis avec la police ?
Pas depuis que j'ai quittÃ©
la bande Ã  MacDowell.
On allait en ville,
dans les bars et les cinÃ©mas,
mais maintenant,
je me tiens tranquille.
Donc, tout va bien ?
Oui. Mais au moindre pÃ©pin
dans le secteur,
la police dÃ©barque chez nous.
Ne t'inquiÃ¨te pas.
Tu iras bientÃ´t travailler.
Tu te feras des amis.
Tu dois avoir hÃ¢te.
- Tu as trouvÃ© du travail ?
- Non.
Je dois voir
au Bureau de Placement.
- Quel genre de travail ?
- N'importe quoi...
Tu n'aimerais pas
quelque chose qui t'intÃ©resse ?
Je n'ai pas beaucoup le choix.
Tu voulais quitter l'Ã©cole, non ?
Ãa m'est Ã©gal.
Je croyais
que t'aimais pas l'Ã©cole.
Je n'aime pas travailler non plus.
Je serai payÃ©.
C'est dÃ©jÃ  quelque chose.
C'est vrai.
Je pourrai peut-Ãªtre
me payer un Ã©pervier.
J'ai lu des choses lÃ -dessus.
- Quand le fais-tu voler ?
- Le soir.
- OÃ¹ Ã§a ?
- PrÃ¨s de chez nous.
- Wood Lane, c'est Ã§a ?
- C'est Ã§a.
Je passerai. Si tu es d'accord.
Allez, va te laver !
"5 shillings, couplÃ© sur Crackpot
et Tell Him He's Dead.
Jud."
Merde, alors !
Merde !
- Pas trop tard ?
- Non. Mais il faut vous Ã©loigner.
- PrÃ¨s de la barriÃ¨re, Ã§a ira ?
- Oui.
Et ne faites pas de bruit.
Je ne dirai pas un mot.
Bravo, Casper. Je n'ai jamais vu Ã§a.
Sensationnel !
- C'est une expÃ©rience unique.
- Merci.
On peut le regarder ?
Quelle belle bÃªte !
Regarde ces plumes !
Il ne va pas manger Ã§a ?
Mais si.
Cet oiseau est plein de vitamines.
Tu as dÃ©jÃ  eu des animaux ?
Des tas !
MÃªme un renardeau
que j'ai Ã©levÃ© et relÃ¢chÃ©.
Une petite peste !
Des pies, des corneilles.
Un jeune geai, une fois.
C'est lui, ton prÃ©fÃ©rÃ© ?
Il a une autre classe.
Attention ! Ãa glisse.
Regardez ce qu'il reste.
Rien que les pattes.
- Il devait avoir faim.
- Il devait crever de faim.
Restez lÃ .
Je vais le mettre sur son perchoir.
Il a quelque chose d'Ã©trange
quand il vole.
C'est l'oiseau le plus rapide.
Ce n'est pas Ã§a.
Son vol donne
une drÃ´le d'impression.
Peut-Ãªtre Ã  cause du silence ?
Oui, c'est Ã§a.
On l'a dÃ©jÃ  remarquÃ©.
Les hiboux, c'est pareil.
Quand ils attrapent
les souris, la nuit...
C'est comme quand on se bouche
les oreilles.
On n'entend plus rien.
Ils volent
dans une poche de silence.
Nous avons mÃªme baissÃ© la voix.
On n'ose pas l'Ã©lever,
comme dans une Ã©glise.
- Ils sont nerveux.
- C'est plus que Ã§a.
C'est instinctif.
Une sorte de respect.
Je sais. C'est ce qui m'Ã©nerve.
Quand je me promÃ¨ne avec
et qu'on me dit:
"VoilÃ  Billy Casper
et son chouchou",
j'ai envie de les engueuler.
Ou alors, quelqu'un demande:
"Est-il apprivoisÃ© ?"
ApprivoisÃ©, mon Åil !
On ne l'apprivoise pas,
on le dirige.
Il est cruel et sauvage
et ne se laisse pas faire.
MÃªme pas par moi.
C'est lÃ  son charme.
Les gens aiment que leurs bÃªtes
soient chouchoutÃ©es.
Pour moi,
ce qui compte,
c'est de le faire voler.
Qu'ils gardent leurs perroquets,
les gens.
Je crois que tu as raison.
Au fond, c'est une faveur
qu'il me laisse le regarder.
Je peux t'aider ?
Non, merci !
Ils valent combien, ceux-lÃ  ?
Lesquels ?
Crackpot ?
Ã 100 contre 6.
Tell Him He's Dead ?
J'y ai songÃ© moi-mÃªme.
DeuxiÃ¨me favori Ã  4 contre 1.
Vous parieriez dessus ?
Tell Him He's Dead est bon.
C'est le meilleur cheval
de la course.
L'autre ne me plaÃ®t pas.
On ne connaÃ®t pas le jockey.
Non, je laisserais tomber.
Ils n'ont aucune chance, alors ?
- Tu joues couplÃ© ?
- Pas moi. Jud !
S'ils gagnent, ce sera beau.
Mais je n'y crois pas.
Un shilling de frites
et du poisson...
Sers-le, Mary !
Oui, mon chou.
Que veux-tu ?
Du poisson avec des frites.
ArrÃªte ! On vient de l'installer.
Vous avez des restes ?
Oui, mon chou. Je te les prÃ©pare.
2 shillings !
Tu as fini tes frites, Floyd ?
Il se fait tard.
Oui. Ne te fÃ¢che pas.
Ta monnaie.
Ces gosses,
ils sont tous les mÃªmes.
Ãa sent bon.
Je voudrais de la viande.
Tu as encore ton oiseau ?
Je t'en fais cadeau.
- C'est vrai ?
- Ce sont des rognures.
- Encore une frite ?
- Je vais bientÃ´t manger.
TrÃ¨s bien. Ã demain.
Du mal Ã  vous concentrer ?
3 fois 5 = 15.
Nous Ã©crivons 1 et 5.
Tu Ã©cris 5 et 1.
Ce n'est pas ton fameux frÃ¨re ?
Il revient dans son ancien lycÃ©e ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
Tu ne te sens pas bien ?
Non, monsieur.
Veux-tu un verre d'eau ?
Non, monsieur.
Ouvre la fenÃªtre.
Ãa te fera du bien.
Je vais trÃ¨s bien.
Passez vos cahiers
vers le premier rang.
Le premier de chaque rangÃ©e
me les remettra.
Tu as perdu quelque chose ?
- Moi, non !
- Alors, sauve-toi !
- Qu'est-ce qui t'arrive, Jud ?
- Ce qui m'arrive ?
C'est ce petit salaud de Billy.
Au lieu de parier pour moi,
il a gardÃ© l'argent.
Je le tuerai si je l'attrape.
- Ã quoi joues-tu ?
- J'allais aux toilettes.
DÃ©pÃªche-toi !
Eh, je suis lÃ  !
- Tu as vu Billy ?
- Oui. Il est ici, avec moi.
Fais pas le malin
ou je te colle la tÃªte dans le trou.
- L'as-tu vu ?
- Je ne te le dirais pas.
Ãcoute, je te prÃ©viens...
Tibutt, tu n'as pas vu Jud ?
OÃ¹ Ã©tais-tu ?
On t'a cherchÃ© partout.
- Qui Ã§a ?
- Gryce-pudding.
J'ai rien fait.
Le Bureau de Placement
voulait te voir.
As-tu vu Jud ?
Il a demandÃ© aprÃ¨s toi, c'est tout.
Pourquoi t'es-tu sauvÃ© ?
Casper ! OÃ¹ Ã©tais-tu ?
Nulle part.
- C'est toi, l'Homme Invisible ?
- Je suis allÃ© aux toilettes.
Tu es tombÃ© dans le trou ?
On t'a cherchÃ© partout.
J'ai pris un peu l'air, aprÃ¨s.
- Et oÃ¹ vas-tu ?
- Au Placement.
Ton rendez-vous ? DÃ©pÃªche-toi.
Dieu garde ton futur employeur !
Assieds-toi correctement.
Et n'aie pas peur de parler.
Dis-lui que tu veux
un emploi de bureau.
Ãa m'intÃ©resse pas.
Tu prÃ©fÃ¨res Ãªtre Ã©boueur ?
Tais-toi.
- Tiens-toi bien.
- Je me tiens bien.
Arrange ta cravate !
Tu as bientÃ´t fini ?
Faut bien le faire.
C'est ta mÃ¨re ?
- OÃ¹ veux-tu travailler ?
- Dans la mine.
- Tu n'iras pas !
- J'irai !
C'est ton tour !
Oui, je crois.
Vas-y, alors.
Sors ! Frappe et attends !
Si tu veux entrer, entre !
- Assis, Walker !
- Je ne suis pas Walker.
Qui alors ? Le suivant sur la liste,
c'est Walker.
Oliver, Stanton et Walker.
Je m'appelle Casper.
Tu devais venir plus tÃ´t,
n'est-ce pas ?
Quel travail voudrais-tu faire ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je n'y ai pas rÃ©flÃ©chi.
Tu devrais.
Tu veux partir du bon pied, non ?
Veux-tu travailler dans un bureau ?
Ou prÃ©fÃ¨res-tu le travail manuel ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Travailler de tes mains,
fermier, plombier...
au lieu de tenir un stylo.
Ãa m'irait, un bureau !
J'ai du mal Ã  lire et Ã  Ã©crire.
Manuel...
Dis-moi, Casper.
As-tu jamais songÃ©
Ã  apprendre un mÃ©tier ?
Ãlectricien, maÃ§on,
quelque chose comme Ã§a.
Ãa ne paie pas lourd
tant que tu es apprenti,
mais si tu persÃ©vÃ¨res,
tu auras un mÃ©tier dans les mains.
Qu'en penses-tu, Casper ?
Si tu prÃ©fÃ¨res le travail manuel,
ce serait mieux.
Il faudra aller au collÃ¨ge technique
et passer des examens,
mais certains y arrivent.
Ils suivent des cours du soir
jusqu'Ã  vingt ans environ,
puis ils passent leur C.A.P.
ou plus.
Dis, petit, tu m'Ã©coutes ?
On ne le dirait pas.
J'en ai d'autres Ã  voir avant 4 h.
Si rien de tout Ã§a ne te tente,
il y a de bons emplois dans la mine.
Je n'irai pas dans la mine.
Tu sais, les conditions de travail
ont Ã©tÃ© amÃ©liorÃ©es.
PlutÃ´t crever que la mine.
Qu'est-ce que tu aimes faire ?
Du jardinage,
du meccano ou quoi ?
Tu n'as pas de hobby ?
Je peux m'en aller ?
Assieds-toi ! Je n'ai pas fini !
Je n'ai jamais vu
un numÃ©ro comme toi !
Ou tu es prÃªt Ã  bondir,
ou tu n'Ã©coutes pas.
Prends ce formulaire.
Tu as tous les renseignements
lÃ -dessus.
Retraite, sÃ©curitÃ© sociale,
salaire, etc.
Il y a un coupon Ã  dÃ©tacher au dos.
Si tu veux tes papiers,
remplis-le.
Viens ici, je n'ai pas fini.
Remplis le coupon
et envoie-le au Bureau.
N'oublie pas. Et Ã©coute...
Si tu as du mal Ã  te dÃ©cider,
viens me voir.
Envoie-moi le suivant !
- Avez-vous vu Jud ?
- Non, dÃ©solÃ©e.
- Vous avez vu Jud ?
- Ãa oui !
T'as pas dÃ» le voir,
sinon tu serais en morceaux.
- Vous l'avez vu ?
- Il est venu faire du raffut.
- Il voulait tout casser.
- Et aprÃ¨s ?
On a dÃ» lui prouver
que tu n'avais pas pariÃ©.
- Ils ont gagnÃ© ?
- Les deux.
- Il aurait ramassÃ© 10 Â£ au moins.
- Merde, alors !
OÃ¹ est-il ?
Qu'as-tu fait ?
OÃ¹ Ã©tais-tu ? Ton thÃ© refroidit.
OÃ¹ est-il ?
- Ã qui parles-tu ?
- Ã toi, salaud !
Sois poli !
Jud, pourquoi cette bagarre ?
Il le sait bien !
Si j'avais pu t'attraper
cet aprÃ¨s-midi...
- Fous-moi la paix.
- Il sait quoi ?
Que lui as-tu fait ?
Il n'avait qu'Ã  placer le pari
sur mes chevaux.
- Il l'a fait, non ?
- Mon cul !
Je le lui avais rappelÃ©, ce matin.
- Il a pris l'argent pour lui.
- Qu'en sais-tu ?
Qu'est-ce que Ã§a peut faire ?
Ils ont gagnÃ© ou quoi ?
J'aurais eu 16 Â£
s'il ne m'avait pas volÃ©.
- C'est malin.
- T'avais qu'Ã  le faire !
16 Â£. Une semaine de congÃ© !
EspÃ¨ce de salaud !
Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
Il s'est vengÃ© en tuant mon faucon.
Pas possible !
J'en suis sÃ»r.
Parce qu'il n'a pas pu m'attraper.
Tu ne lui as pas tuÃ© son faucon ?
Si ! Et aprÃ¨s ?
C'est toi qu'on devrait tuer.
C'est sa faute.
Je voulais le libÃ©rer mais il m'a
attaquÃ©. Que pouvais-je faire ?
Tu es un sale bÃ¢tard !
- Ne m'appelle pas bÃ¢tard !
- ArrÃªte !
Tu es un bÃ¢tard de la pire espÃ¨ce !
Surveille ton langage !
16 Â£. Une semaine de repos !
- OÃ¹ est l'oiseau ?
- Dans la poubelle !
C'est toi qu'on aurait dÃ» y mettre.
J'aurais plutÃ´t jetÃ© Billy dedans.
Tuer un oiseau !
Tais-toi ! Je t'interdis
de me parler sur ce ton, sinon...
Cause toujours !
Ne me pousse pas Ã  bout.
J'en ai assez.
- Ta gueule !
- Toi-mÃªme !
J'en ai marre de cette baraque.
Et moi, de te voir lÃ  !
S'en prendre Ã  ce gamin !
Tu es un salaud !
Regarde ce qu'il a fait !
- Quelle brute !
- C'est dÃ©goÃ»tant d'avoir fait Ã§a.
Lui m'en a fait autant.
Le faucon n'y Ã©tait pour rien.
Tu sais Ã  quel point il y tenait.
EnlÃ¨ve-le de lÃ  !
- Que lui feras-tu ?
- Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
Donne-lui une raclÃ©e !
J'aimerais voir Ã§a !
Ãa suffit. Ce n'est qu'un oiseau.
Trouves-en un autre.
Il ne vaut pas un clou !
Sors et reste dehors !
$&$Les quatre cents coups$&$
Doinel, apportez-moi
ce que vous avez lÃ .
Ah, c'est du joli. Au piquet.
Plus qu'une minute.
- Ah...
- Silence !
Nous allons ramasser
dans 30 secondes.
- Ah...
- Silence ! Silence !
Les chefs de rangÃ©es,
peuvent se tenir prÃªts.
Je compte jusqu'Ã  trois.
Un...
deux...
trois. Ramassez.
Ramasse derriÃ¨re.
- Allez, donne.
- Une seconde, quoi.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Il veut pas donner sa feuille.
Pas de favoritisme.
LÃ©cheux.
Tout le monde a remis sa copie ?
Vous pouvez sortir.
Non, pardon, pas vous.
La rÃ©crÃ©ation n'est pas un dÃ»,
c'est une rÃ©compense.
Monsieur le directeur,
j'ai voulu dire Ã  la mÃ¨re de ce petit
et je lui ai dit :
"Madame, monsieur le directeur..."
Ici souffrit le pauvre Antoine
Doinel, puni injustement
par Petite Feuille
pour une pin up tombÃ©e du ciel.
Entre nous, ce sera
"dent pour dent, Åil pour Åil".
Alors, les champions, vous avez
besoin d'un arbitre, peut-Ãªtre.
Vous pourrez vous entraÃ®ner
pendant trois jours.
Pas de rÃ©crÃ©ation, le repos.
Trois jours de repos,
Ã§a vous fera du bien.
Allez, allez, allez.
Allons, allons ! Qu'est-ce qu'il y a
de si intÃ©ressant lÃ -bas ?
Ã vos places !
Bravo !
Nous avons un nouveau Juvenal
dans la classe.
Mais il est encore incapable
de distinguer un alexandrin
d'un dÃ©casyllabe.
Primo, Doinel, vous allez me conjuguer,
pour demain...
Allez Ã  votre place
noter la phrase.
Ã tous les temps de l'indicatif,
du conditionnel et du subjonctif...
Les autres, prenez votre cahier
de rÃ©citation.
Je dÃ©grade les murs
de la classe...
et je malmÃ¨ne
la prosodie franÃ§aise.
FranÃ§aise.
Le liÃ¨vre.
Secundo, Doinel,
vous allez descendre tout de suite
chez le concierge
chercher de quoi effacer ces insanitÃ©s.
Sinon, je vous les fais lÃ©cher,
moi, mon ami.
Richier...
qui vous a permis
de changer de place ?
Au temps oÃ¹ les buissons...
les buissons...
flambent de fleurs...
vermeilles...
Quand dÃ©jÃ  le bout noir...
Quand dÃ©jÃ ...
le bout noir...
de mes longues oreilles...
se voyait...
par-dessus...
les seigles encore verts...
dont...
je broutais...
les brins...
en jouant au travers.
Un jour...
que, fatiguÃ©...
je dormais...
dans mon gÃ®te,
la petite Margot me surprit.
Je m'agite...
Je ne suis pas le seul,
n'est-ce pas, Simoneau ?
- J'ai rien fait, monsieur.
- Naturellement, c'est toujours l'autre.
Certes, elle m'aimait bien,
la gentille maÃ®tresse...
Hou...
Quelle bontÃ© pour moi,
que de soins, de tendresse.
Comme elle me pressait
sur ses petits genoux
et me baisait...
Quel est l'imbÃ©cile qui a sifflÃ© ?
Ah, je vous prÃ©viens,
je vais Ãªtre injuste.
Si le coupable ne se dÃ©nonce pas,
c'est le voisin qui prendra.
- N'est-ce pas, Simoneau ?
- Je vous jure, monsieur...
- C'est pas moi, monsieur.
- Des lÃ¢ches en plus.
Ah, quelle annÃ©e, quelle classe !
Ah, j'en ai connu, des crÃ©tins.
Mais au moins, ils Ã©taient discrets.
Ils se cachaient, ils restaient
dans leur coin. Et vous ?
Vous pensez avoir effacÃ© ?
Non, vous avez sali, mon ami.
Allez Ã  votre place
copier la rÃ©citation.
Tant pis pour vous,
vos parents paieront.
Ah, elle va Ãªtre un peu belle,
la France, dans 10 ans !
Bien quoi ? Tout le monde fauche
de l'argent Ã  ses parents.
- Oui, mais c'est difficile.
- MÃªme Morisset, je te parie.
- HÃ© ! Morisset, viens voir.
- On a un renseignement Ã  te demander.
OÃ¹ tu les as achetÃ©es,
ces belles lunettes ?
Au bazar de l'HÃ´tel de ville.
Le fric, tu l'avais piquÃ© Ã  ton pÃ¨re
ou Ã  ta mÃ¨re ?
Hein, Morisset ?
Tu vas nous dire
qu'avec ta gueule de faux jeton,
tu leur fais pas les poches
de temps en temps.
C'Ã©tait toi, petit salaud,
qui m'as fait poirer tout Ã  l'heure.
- Salaud, Morisset ! DÃ©gueulasse.
- Tes jours sont comptÃ©s, Morisset.
Il va t'arriver du mouron,
Morisset !
Dis donc, j'arriverai jamais
Ã  finir ce soir.
Quel salaud, quand mÃªme,
ce Petite Feuille !
C'est son mÃ©tier.
N'empÃªche qu'avant d'aller
au service militaire,
je lui bourrerai bien la gueule
et on se marrera. Salut.
Salut.
Que je dÃ©gradasse
les murs de la classe.
- Bonsoir, maman.
- Hum. Bonsoir, bonsoir.
- OÃ¹ est la farine ?
- Quelle farine ?
Mais qu'est-ce que c'est que Ã§a ?
Tu ne m'as pas achetÃ©
ce que j'avais marquÃ©.
OÃ¹ as-tu mis le mot
que je t'avais laissÃ© ?
- Je l'ai perdu.
- Pas Ã©tonnant aprÃ¨s Ã§a
que tu aies de si mauvaises notes.
Allez, va me chercher mes mules.
Elles sont dans la chambre.
Sous le lit !
En attendant, j'ai besoin de farine.
Allez, va m'en chercher tout de suite.
Bien, maman.
Il a fallu lui mettre les fers,
il se prÃ©sentait par les fesses.
Remarquez que Ã§a tient
un peu de famille.
- Pour sa mÃ¨re, c'Ã©tait pareil.
- Ãa ne veut rien dire.
Regardez, moi, pour le premier,
en 10 minutes, c'Ã©tait fini.
Mais pour la petite, pardon.
Si on m'avait pas fait
une cÃ©sarienne,
je serais pas en train de vous parler
en ce moment.
Et ma sÅur, un par an,
vous vous rendez compte ?
"Au prochain, je vous condamne",
lui avait dit le docteur.
Ã la fin, ils lui ont tout enlevÃ©.
Du sang partout.
Ãtais-tu en train
de cavaler, fiston ?
Je viens de me faire engueuler
pour une histoire de farine.
J'espÃ¨re que tu vas pas
encore faire crier ta mÃ¨re.
Tu sais bien qu'il faut la mÃ©nager.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que Ã§a ?
Un phare antibrouillard
pour la teuf-teuf.
Je l'Ã©trennerai dimanche
au rallye.
Ha ! Ha !
Regarde ton fils. Quel enfarinÃ© !
Je t'assure que je n'ai pas envie
de plaisanter.
Moi qui croyais justement...
Rends-moi la monnaie.
Il me faut de l'argent
pour la cantine.
Adresse-toi Ã  ton pÃ¨re. Allez.
Bien oui.
Tiens, maman.
Les hirondelles volent bas,
dis donc.
- Il me faudrait un peu d'argent.
- Qu'est-ce que tu dis ?
Il me faut juste 1 000 francs.
Si tu me demandes 1 000 francs,
c'est que tu en espÃ¨res 500.
Donc t'as besoin de 300.
Tiens, voilÃ  100 balles.
- Tiens, voilÃ  500, va.
- Merci, papa.
En principe, c'est ta mÃ¨re
qui paie Ã§a.
OÃ¹ sont passÃ©s les ciseaux ?
OÃ¹ sont passÃ©s les ciseaux
Intelligent, Ã§a, encore.
Il y a pas de quoi rire.
C'est pas le moment
de faire tes devoirs.
- On va se mettre Ã  table.
- Elle a raison.
Chaque chose en son temps,
chacun Ã  sa place
et les vaches,
elles sont bien gardÃ©es.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ce stylo ?
Je l'ai Ã©changÃ©.
Tu fais beaucoup d'Ã©changes
en ce moment.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Tu sens ?
C'est le poisson.
Ãa promet.
Dis, va demander Ã  ta mÃ¨re
si le torchon brÃ»le.
Pourquoi ?
Pour rigoler.
S'il te plaÃ®t, mon petit, tu peux
commencer Ã  dÃ©barrasser.
- Ton cousin m'a tÃ©lÃ©phonÃ©.
- Tiens.
- Sa femme attend encore un mÃ´me.
- Le quatriÃ¨me en trois ans ?
C'est du lapinisme.
Je trouve Ã§a rÃ©pugnant.
Ã propos, qu'est-ce qu'on fait
du gosse pendant les vacances ?
Les colonies de vacances,
c'est pas fait pour les caniches.
- Ã cet Ã¢ge, ils s'amusent entre eux.
- On a le temps d'y penser.
Les vacances, on n'y pense
jamais trop tÃ´t.
LÃ . Ne tire pas trop.
Elle est chouette, hein ?
Club des Lions.
Qu'est-ce que c'est
que ce dÃ©mÃ©nagement ?
Oui, bien, va doucement.
J'aimerais savoir si dimanche,
tu prÃ©fÃ¨res la VallÃ©e de Chevreuse
ou les bords de l'Oise puisque
c'est moi qui ai le choix du parcours.
- Dimanche, je me repose.
- OÃ¹ ?
Je vais passer la journÃ©e
chez mon amie Huguette.
J'aurai l'air fin, moi,
en tant qu'organisateur.
Moi, je n'en peux plus, tu comprends ?
Le mÃ©nage toute la matinÃ©e
- et l'aprÃ¨s-midi--
- L'aprÃ¨s-midi, les touches.
- Quoi ?
- Enfin, celles-lÃ  ou les autres.
Antoine, qu'est-ce que tu attends
pour aller te coucher ?
Bonsoir, papa, maman.
Ce que tu peux Ãªtre stupide,
toi, alors.
Le jour oÃ¹ tu comprendras
la plaisanterie, toi...
Parfaitement.
Tu perds ton temps...
Antoine, n'oublie pas les ordures
et Ã©teins la lumiÃ¨re
dÃ¨s que tu seras couchÃ©.
Les rallyes, Ã§a crÃ©e des relations.
Tu verras quand je serai Ã©lu
vice-prÃ©sident du premier secteur.
Nos Ã©missions sont terminÃ©es.
Bonsoir, mesdames, mesdemoiselles.
Bonsoir, messieurs.
Allons, dÃ©pÃªche-toi, il est tard.
On a pas entendu le rÃ©veil.
Que je dÃ©gradasse
les murs de la classe.
Il n'y a presque plus de chaussette
autour de ma paire de trous.
Elles sont fichues, celles-lÃ .
AchÃ¨tes-en des neuves.
Les autres sont au sale.
Je t'ai bien donnÃ© l'argent pour les
draps de lit du gosse ? Tu te souviens ?
Oui. Tu sais, il aime autant dormir
dans son sac de couchage.
N'est-ce pas, petit ?
Je suis au chaud lÃ -dedans.
C'est au petit poil.
Comment, t'es encore lÃ , toi ?
Au revoir, papa, maman.
- HÃ©, Antoine !
- Tiens, salut.
- Il faut pas courir comme Ã§a.
- Mais on va Ãªtre en retard.
La petite porte sera fermÃ©e,
il faudra encore passer chez le dirlo
pour la dÃ©rouille, il suffit.
- Il faut pas se presser.
- Pourquoi ?
Petite Feuille a dit
qu'il laisserait pas rentrer.
- Tu crois qu'il le ferait ?
- SÃ»r, il peut pas te piffer.
- Have you money ?
- Yes, for the cantine.
Fais-moi confiance.
Par ici, la sortie.
Qu'est-ce qu'on va foutre
maintenant ?
Tiens, suis-moi.
Fous ton cartable Ã  cÃ´tÃ© du mien.
- On nous le piquera pas ?
- C'est toujours ici que je le mets.
Mon Dieu, Antoine !
Il m'a sÃ»rement vue.
- Ton fils, c'est lequel des deux ?
- Le chÃ¢tain.
Je ne comprends pas,
il devrait Ãªtre Ã  l'Ã©cole.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas prendre
ce soir.
Penses-tu ? Elle osera jamais
le dire Ã  mon pÃ¨re.
- Comment est le type ?
- Je l'ai jamais vu.
Comme Ã§a, t'es sauvÃ©.
Je suis bien dÃ©cidÃ©
Ã  rentrer demain.
Seulement, il me faudra
un mot d'excuse.
Comment tu vas faire, toi ?
J'en ai un vieux
qui a jamais servi.
Je couperai la date.
Je te le prÃªte jusqu'Ã  demain.
T'as qu'Ã  le recopier.
- Pour l'Ã©criture ?
- Imite celle de ta mÃ¨re.
Ãa sera difficile, tu sais.
Elle Ã©crit drÃ´lement pointu.
T'en fais pas, Ã§a ira.
J'espÃ¨re bien. Salut.
Salut.
Monsieur...
Je vous prie...
d'excuser...
mon fils RenÃ©...
qui a Ã©tÃ© malade...
Mon fils RenÃ© !?
- Bonsoir, papa.
- Salut.
Ãa sent encore le brÃ»lÃ© lÃ -dedans.
Oh, Ã§a vient d'en dessous.
Tu mettras le couvert
pour deux seulement.
Pourquoi ? Maman est partie ?
Non, mais elle m'a tÃ©lÃ©phonÃ©
qu'elle rentrerait plus tard ce soir.
Son patron la retient
pour les bilans de fin d'annÃ©e.
On va se faire la cuisine tous les deux
puis on va manger entre hommes.
Elle m'a dit qu'il y avait des Åufs
quelque part.
Oui, je sais oÃ¹ ils sont.
- Tu as bien travaillÃ© aujourd'hui ?
- Oui.
- Qu'est-ce que vous avez fait ?
- Le liÃ¨vre.
Ah oui ?
Le liÃ¨vre et la tortue.
Mais non, Le liÃ¨vre... Tout seul.
On l'a expliquÃ©.
- T'as bien rÃ©pondu ?
- On m'a pas interrogÃ©.
Il faut demander, mon vieux,
il faut aller de l'avant.
Sinon tu seras jamais
dans la course.
Dans la vie, il faut savoir
prendre des initiatives.
Ã propos, t'as pensÃ© Ã  l'anniversaire
de ta mÃ¨re ?
C'est le 17, tu sais.
J'espÃ¨re que tu vas
lui offrir quelque chose.
Antoine, tu m'entends ?
Oui, je sais ce que tu penses.
Elle a Ã©tÃ© un peu dure avec toi
ces temps-ci,
mais forcÃ©ment,
elle est trÃ¨s nerveuse.
Il faut se mettre Ã  sa place.
Elle a beaucoup Ã  faire.
Tenir un intÃ©rieur
quand on travaille l'aprÃ¨s-midi...
Surtout qu'ici,
c'est beaucoup trop petit.
Remarque, on va dÃ©mÃ©nager,
je suis sur une piste.
Au bureau, tu comprends,
c'est toujours pareil.
Les femmes, on les exploite.
Elles savent pas se dÃ©fendre.
Elle t'aime, tu sais, elle t'aime.
Oh, merde.
- Antoine !
- Oui, papa ?
- OÃ¹ as-tu mis mon guide Michelin ?
- J'y ai pas touchÃ©.
Antoine, tu sais trÃ¨s bien que
je ne peux pas supporter le mensonge.
C'est la vÃ©ritÃ©, papa.
Je suis sÃ»r de l'avoir
remis en place hier.
- Je te jure que c'est pas moi.
- C'est incomprÃ©hensible.
Les choses se volatilisent
dans cette baraque.
C'est pas moi.
Bon, bon, je demanderai Ã  ta mÃ¨re.
Il est temps
de te coucher maintenant.
N'oublie pas les ordures.
C'est mon patron
qui m'a raccompagnÃ©e.
- Patron, patron ?
- Oui, parfaitement.
Je ne peux tout de mÃªme pas refuser
qu'il me ramÃ¨ne Ã  la maison !
- Un tarif de nuit, Ã§a compte double.
- Tu seras content Ã  la fin du mois.
Ce genre d'heures supplÃ©mentaires,
Ã§a se paie comptant.
Ah, Ã§a suffit, Ã§a suffit !
Je comprends que le dimanche,
madame ait besoin de repos.
Ã propos, oÃ¹ as-tu mis
le guide Michelin ?
Est-ce que je sais ?
Il fallait le demander au gosse.
- Il dit qu'il n'y a pas touchÃ©.
- Il ment comme il respire.
- Il a de qui tenir.
- Si tu l'Ã©levais mieux.
Merde, alors !
Je lui ai donnÃ© un nom, je le nourris.
Ah, j'en ai assez, assez, assez !
Si tu ne peux pas
le supporter, dis-le.
On va le mettre chez les JÃ©suites
ou chez les enfants de troupes !
Que j'aie enfin droit
Ã  un peu de calme !
Oh-oh, RenÃ© ! Oh-oh !
Il n'y a qu'Ã  aller manger
au restaurant jusqu'Ã  la fin du mois.
Il me faudrait une chemise propre !
Si t'as pas le temps pour
la chemise, lave au moins le col.
Si t'avais pas achetÃ© ce phare
antibrouillard pour Ã©pater la galerie.
Je l'ai achetÃ© d'occasion.
Eh bien, va ouvrir.
Et si c'Ã©tait le gaz ?
Ãa se saurait,
ils prÃ©viennent d'avance.
Bonjour, monsieur.
Je suis le camarade de classe d'Antoine.
Je viens voir s'il va mieux.
Mieux ? Pourquoi ?
Parce qu'il a manquÃ© hier,
toute la journÃ©e.
Tu entends Ã§a ?
Merci, petit.
Au revoir, monsieur.
Ãa n'a pas l'air de t'Ã©tonner.
Pourquoi veux-tu que Ã§a m'Ã©tonne ?
Je m'attends Ã  tout de sa part.
Je me demande ce que je vais
trouver comme excuse.
Faut trouver quelque chose d'Ã©norme.
Plus c'est gros, plus Ã§a passe.
Quand ma mÃ¨re s'est cassÃ© la guibolle,
je suis rentrÃ© Ã  l'Ã©cole.
J'ai tout racontÃ©,
il y a pas eu besoin de mot.
Je peux pas raconter un truc pareil,
mon vieux, Ã©coute.
Il faut pas qu'on rentre ensemble
Ã  l'Ã©cole.
De toute faÃ§on,
tu pars le premier.
Ah, te voilÃ , toi.
Il suffit d'un devoir supplÃ©mentaire
pour te rendre malade, hein ?
Et les parents
tombent dans le panneau.
Je serais curieux de savoir
ce que tu leur as soutirÃ© comme excuse.
- Fais voir ton mot.
- J'en ai pas, monsieur.
Ah, t'en as pas ? Tu crois
que Ã§a va se passer comme Ã§a ?
Ce serait trop facile, mon ami.
Monsieur, c'Ã©tait...
c'Ã©tait ma mÃ¨re, monsieur.
- Ta mÃ¨re, qu'est-ce qu'elle a encore ?
- Elle est morte.
Ah, fiston.
Excuse-moi, mon petit,
je pouvais pas savoir.
Elle Ã©tait malade ?
Bien oui, monsieur.
Il fallait m'en parler.
Il faut toujours se confier
Ã  ses maÃ®tres.
Allez, rejoins tes camarades.
Qu'est-ce que t'as trouvÃ©
comme excuse ?
Laisse-moi tranquille.
Mieux vaut l'Ã©pine au bois...
l'Ã©pine au bois...
L'Ã©pine oÃ¹ je pense.
Si vous vous laviez les oreilles,
du Verger,
vous entendriez ce qu'on vous souffle
par derriÃ¨re.
L'Ã©pine au cul.
Il me souffle pas, monsieur,
il cherche Ã  me faire tromper.
Ãa suffit, continuez.
Je ne sais plus oÃ¹ j'en suis,
monsieur.
Que les fleurs dans la crÃ¨che...
Que les fleurs dans la crÃ¨che,
mieux vaut l'indÃ©pendance.
Et l'incessant pÃ©ril...
Que l'esclavage...
Avec un Ã©ternel avril.
Vous Ãªtes un Ã©ternel cossard,
du Verger. Asseyez-vous.
Je le savais Ã  la maison.
- Doinel.
- Oui, monsieur ?
Excusez-moi, mon petit.
Simoneau.
Le liÃ¨vre.
Monsieur le directeur.
De Jean Richepin.
Asseyez-vous, mes enfants,
asseyez-vous.
Monsieur le directeur, j'estime
que la sanction doit Ãªtre Ã  la mesure--
Mais la mesure est dÃ©passÃ©e,
mon cher.
Nous sommes dÃ©passÃ©s
par l'anomalie d'une telle faute.
Seuls les parents
ont pouvoir de sÃ©vir.
On s'expliquera tous les deux
ce soir, Ã  la maison.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
De toute faÃ§on, aprÃ¨s ce coup-lÃ ,
je ne peux plus vivre avec mes parents.
Il faut que je disparaisse,
tu comprends ?
Les miens, ils en ont vu d'autres.
Oui, mais il y en a marre.
Il faut que je vive ma vie.
Je leur Ã©crirai une lettre
pour leur expliquer.
- Tout de suite ?
- Oui, Ã§a vaut mieux.
OÃ¹ est-ce que tu vas coucher
ce soir ?
J'en sais rien. Ãa m'est Ã©gal.
J'ai peut-Ãªtre une idÃ©e.
Rendez-vous dans une heure
devant le jet d'eau de la Place Pigalle.
Oui, d'accord.
- Salut.
- Salut.
C'est une vieille imprimerie
qui appartient Ã  mon oncle.
Le plancher s'est Ã©croulÃ©
Ã  cause du poids des machines.
Tu crois pas que Ã§a pourrait
encore s'Ã©crouler ?
Pas de danger,
Ã§a peut pas tomber plus bas.
En tout cas, tu auras pas froid.
Ãa, c'est un vrai matelas.
Ãa, c'est pour faire un oreiller.
Ah, la vache,
c'est drÃ´lement lourd.
Jusqu'Ã  minuit, t'as qu'Ã  aller
te promener.
Garde mon cartable.
Tu me le rendras demain.
Entendu.
"Mes chers parents.
Je comprends - sans s -
- la gravitÃ© de mon mensonge."
- Oh, tu parles.
Pourquoi est-ce moi qu'il a fait mourir
plutÃ´t que toi ?
Question de prÃ©fÃ©rence,
c'est clair.
"AprÃ¨s cela, la vie entre nous
n'est plus possible.
"Aussi, je vais tenter ma chance,
tout seul, dans la capitale ou ailleurs.
"Je veux prouver
que je peux devenir un homme,
"alors je vous reverrai
et nous nous expliquerons surtout.
Je vous quitte
et je vous embrasse. Antoine."
- Tu trouves normal qu'il me dÃ©teste ?
- Tu es de plus en plus dure avec lui.
Je suis surmenÃ©e,
alors il me tape sur les nerfs.
Bonjour, Ernest.
C'est frisquet dehors.
C'est pas chaud.
Oh ! Vous pouvez m'aider
Ã  l'attraper ?
Oui, bien sÃ»r, madame.
- Petit, c'est ta sÅur ?
- Non, je l'ai jamais vue.
Elle m'a demandÃ© de courir
aprÃ¨s son chien.
- Il est perdu ou il est Ã  elle ?
- J'en sais rien.
- On peut vous aider ?
- Mais bien sÃ»r.
Plus on sera nombreux, plus on aura
de chance de l'attraper.
- Comment s'appelle-t-il ?
- J'en sais rien, moi.
Laisse tomber, petit.
C'est moi qui l'ai vu le premier.
Moi, je cours aprÃ¨s lui.
- T'as compris, oui ?
- Ah...
- Dites donc, Doinel.
- Oui, monsieur ?
Ãa a dÃ» barder chez vous,
hier soir, hein ?
Non, monsieur, pas du tout.
Ãa s'est trÃ¨s bien passÃ©.
Allez, allez.
Les parents...
Dites donc, Chabrol, vous voulez
que je vous aide ?
DerniÃ¨re question,
encore plus simple.
Where is the father ?
The "faser".
Non, the father.
"Faser".
Non, father.
La pointe de la langue
entre les dents.
Father.
Comme si vous zozotiez.
Father.
- "Faser".
- Non !
Je peux pas, monsieur.
Tout le monde peut pas mettre la langue
comme vous dites.
- Taisez-vous !
- Avessez-you... Assevez-you...
Allez vous asseoir.
Et vous Ãªtes un insolent.
Abbou ! Abbou !
Abbou, rÃ©pondez.
Where is the girl ?
The girl is at the "bich".
- No, beach.
- Beach.
The beach.
The beach.
Beach, beach.
L'Ã©lÃ¨ve Doinel doit venir
chez le directeur.
- Doinel ?
- Doinel.
Debout, Abbou. Assis.
Franchaud, je vous nomme responsable
jusqu'Ã  mon retour.
Nous ne savons plus
comment nous y prendre. Mon mari--
Ma chÃ¨re petite madame, vous mÃ©ritiez
mieux qu'un gaillard pareil.
Mon pauvre chÃ©ri.
Il ne t'est rien arrivÃ© au moins ?
- OÃ¹ as-tu passÃ© la nuit ?
- Dans une imprimerie.
Dans une imprimerie.
Qu'il soit dernier en tout
me serait Ã©gal
pourvu qu'il ait
une bonne conduite.
Eh bien, c'est parfait.
C'est...
C'est peut-Ãªtre une question
de glandes.
Il ne faut pas
que tu prennes froid.
LÃ . Et maintenant, au lit.
J'ai pas sommeil, maman.
Non, non, non.
Dans le nÃ´tre, tu seras mieux.
Tu sais, j'ai eu ton Ã¢ge
moi aussi.
Vous oubliez toujours Ã§a,
les gosses.
Moi aussi, j'Ã©tais butÃ©e. Je ne
voulais rien confier Ã  mes parents.
Je prÃ©fÃ©rais tout Ã©crire
dans un journal.
Personne ne l'a jamais lu.
Un jour, je te le montrerai.
Justement, Ã  ton Ã¢ge,
j'Ã©tais en vacances.
Je suis partie
avec un jeune berger.
C'Ã©tait une amourette,
on nous a vite rattrapÃ©s.
Ma mÃ¨re m'a fait promettre
de ne plus jamais le revoir.
Elle n'a rien dit Ã  mon pÃ¨re.
Alors, j'ai beaucoup pleurÃ©.
Mais j'ai obÃ©i.
Parce qu'il faut toujours
obÃ©ir Ã  sa mÃ¨re.
On peut avoir des petits secrets
tous les deux, hein ?
Qu'est-ce que tu as voulu dire
dans ta lettre
quand tu as Ã©crit :
"on s'expliquera surtout" ?
Bien, Ã  cause
de ma mauvaise conduite.
E puis pourquoi je travaille mal
en classe.
Eh bien, dis-le-moi.
Parce que j'arrive pas Ã  Ã©couter.
Je voudrais quitter l'Ã©cole
pour gagner ma vie tout seul.
C'est de la folie,
tu ne te rends pas compte.
Si tu savais comme je regrette
de ne pas avoir Ã©tÃ© au-delÃ  du bachot.
Et ton pÃ¨re qui n'a
que son brevet. Hein ?
Ãa le gÃªne dans sa carriÃ¨re.
Je sais trÃ¨s bien qu'Ã  l'Ã©cole,
on apprend des tas de choses inutiles :
l'algÃ¨bre, la science.
Ãa sert Ã  peu de gens dans la vie.
Mais le franÃ§ais, hein ?
Le franÃ§ais ? On a toujours
des lettres Ã  Ã©crire.
On va avoir un autre secret
tous les deux. Tu veux ?
VoilÃ .
Si, Ã  la prochaine composition
franÃ§aise, tu es dans les...
dans les cinq premiers,
je te donne 1 000 francs.
Mille francs, hein ?
Mais tu ne diras rien Ã  ton pÃ¨re.
"Tout Ã  coup, le moribond
se dressa sur ses deux poings,
"jeta sur ses enfants effrayÃ©s un regard
qui les atteignit tous comme un Ã©clair.
"Les cheveux qui lui garnissaient
la nuque remuÃ¨rent,
"ses rides tressaillirent,
son visage s'anima d'un esprit de feu.
"Un souffle passa sur cette face
et la rendit sublime.
"Il leva une main
crispÃ©e par la rage
"et cria d'une voix Ã©clatante
le fameux mot d'ArchimÃ¨de :
EurÃªka ! J'ai trouvÃ©."
DÃ©crivez un Ã©vÃ©nement grave
dont vous avez Ã©tÃ© le tÃ©moin
et qui vous a
personnellement concernÃ©.
EurÃªka ! J'ai trouvÃ©.
"La mort...
de mon grand-pÃ¨re".
Ãa y est, Lesage
s'envoie la nouvelle dactylo.
Elle a de la dÃ©fense, la petite.
Elle en a profitÃ© pour se faire
bombarder secrÃ©taire de direction.
Elle a pour Ã§a
toutes les aptitudes requises.
Maintenant, il va falloir
se mÃ©fier d'elle.
Because confidences
sur l'oreiller.
Quand elle faisait la province,
je lui avais expliquÃ©
comment ratiboiser
sur les notes de frais.
Mais je t'en fous, elle ne descendait
que dans les hÃ´tels Ã  trois Ã©toiles.
Ã propos, Ã§a me fait penser que
j'ai pas retrouvÃ© mon guide Michelin.
ForcÃ©ment, il y en a un de vous
qui a mis la main dessus.
Tu commences Ã  nous courir
avec ton Michelin.
J'aime pas les mystÃ¨res, moi.
T'as encore laissÃ© quelque chose
sur le feu.
Moi ? Ah non, j'en suis sÃ»re.
Qu'est-ce qui lui prend ?
Ah, c'est le bouquet !
- Mais Ã©teins-le au lieu de crier !
- Ah !
Au lieu de crier,
va chercher de l'eau.
Ah, bougre d'Ã¢ne !
Ãa suffit comme Ã§a !
Qu'est-ce qui t'a pris, bon sang ?
Qu'est-ce qui t'a pris ?
- L'idÃ©e d'allumer une bougie lÃ -dedans ?
- C'Ã©tait pour Balzac, papa.
Balzac ? Balzac ?
Tu m'as pas regardÃ© ?
Tu m'as pas regardÃ© ?
C'Ã©tait pour la compo de franÃ§ais.
Laisse-le, il m'a promis
quelque chose.
Quoi ? De toucher la prime d'incendie
pour toute la baraque ?
Avec une bougie, tu n'y arriveras
jamais, mon bonhomme.
- Tu veux mon briquet ?
- Ne sois pas ridicule !
Aussi longtemps que tu seras nourri
et logÃ© ici, tu feras ce qu'on te dira.
Sinon, je ne vois qu'une solution :
le PrytanÃ©e.
Tu sais pas ce que c'est, mon bonhomme,
hein ? T'apprendras sur place.
Et tu marcheras au pas. Vu ?
Vous ne savez pas ce qu'on va faire
pour changer d'atmosphÃ¨re ?
On va passer la soirÃ©e
au Gaumont Palace tous les trois.
TrÃ¨s bien, parfait.
Excellente mÃ©thode d'Ã©ducation.
Tu es content
de ta composition franÃ§aise ?
Oui, elle est pas mal.
Julien ! Julien !
Ãcoute, Julien, je te demande
de nous faire confiance.
Il nous prÃ©pare une bonne surprise,
c'est promis.
- Oh ! que j'aime pas Ã§a.
- Tu nous emmÃ¨nes au Gaumont Palace ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'on y joue ?
- Paris nous appartient.
- Ah, si c'est un complot.
- Ã moins que tu n'y tiennes pas.
Moi ? Pourquoi ? Mais j'ai bien
travaillÃ©, moi. Je l'ai mÃ©ritÃ©.
Seulement les incendiaires,
au Gaumont, c'est plutÃ´t mal vu.
Ils Ã©taient bons, les esquimos.
J'en avais jamais mangÃ© Ã  la fraise.
C'est parce que
c'Ã©tait pas la saison.
C'est une belle gosse, tout de mÃªme.
Comment dirais-je ?
Elle a un de ces...
C'est tout ce que tu as remarquÃ©,
Ã©videmment.
Un de ces panaches !
Ãa rigole derriÃ¨re, hein ?
- Le film m'a bien plu.
- Mais il Ã©tait pas marrant.
- Ah, si.
- Comment il Ã©tait pas... ?
- Mais il avait du fond.
- Quoi ?
- Il avait du fond.
- Ah oui.
- Le film.
- Oui, oui.
Allez, Ã  la maison.
- Au lit.
- On va faire son gros dodo.
Le gÃ©nÃ©ral du diable
et son Ã©tat-major !
Tu vas rÃ©veiller tout l'immeuble.
Regarde si elle a
de belles jambes, ta mÃ¨re.
Voyons, Julien, sois raisonnable.
Et nous retrouvons
la douceur du foyer.
- Un peu fumant, hein ?
- Mon chÃ©ri, les ordures.
- Tu seras gentil.
- Oui, maman.
Tu vois, je l'ai amadouÃ©.
J'espÃ¨re que je n'aurai pas
lieu de le regretter.
Vu le soin mÃ©nager
dont travaillÃ© je suis,
vu l'importun souci qui,
sans fin, me tourmente,
et vu tant de regrets
desquels je me lamente,
tu t'Ã©bahis souvent...
Je ne chante, Magny,
je pleure mes ennuis.
Ou, pour le dire mieux,
en pleurant je les chante.
Si bien qu'en les chantant,
souvent je les enchante.
VoilÃ  pourquoi, Magny,
je pleure jours et nuits.
Chante ainsi l'ouvrier
faisant son ouvrage.
Ainsi le laboureur
faisant son labourage.
Ainsi l'aventurier
songeant Ã  sa dame.
Ainsi le marinier
en tirant Ã  la rame.
Ainsi le pÃ¨lerin
regrettant sa maison.
Ainsi le prisonnier
maudissant sa prison.
Doinel, si votre copie
se prÃ©sente la premiÃ¨re,
c'est que j'ai dÃ©cidÃ©, aujourd'hui,
de donner les rÃ©sultats
dans l'ordre inverse du mÃ©rite.
La recherche de l'absolu
vous a conduit droit au zÃ©ro, mon ami.
Pour les autres moins familiers
de Balzac,
je dirais qu'il s'agit
d'une tÃ©nÃ©breuse affaire.
Que votre ami Doinel ait cru
devoir choisir pour sujet
la mort de son aÃ¯eul,
c'Ã©tait son droit.
Bien que nous sachions qu'il n'hÃ©site
pas Ã  sacrifier ses proches
quand Ã§a peut lui Ãªtre utile.
C'est pas vrai, monsieur,
j'ai pas copiÃ©.
Qu'on en juge.
"Soudain, le moribond
se dressa sur son lit
"et jeta sur ses enfants pleins
de terreur un regard foudroyant.
"Les cheveux qui lui garnissaient
le crÃ¢ne se dressÃ¨rent,
"ses sourcils se relevÃ¨rent.
"Son visage s'anima comme si le feu
s'y Ã©tait mis, ce qui le rendit sublime.
"Il leva un poing crispÃ© par la rage
et cria d'une voix de tonnerre
le fameux mot d'ArchimÃ¨de :
EurÃªka ! J'ai trouvÃ©."
Moi aussi, j'ai trouvÃ©, Doinel.
- Vous Ãªtes un abominable plagiaire.
- C'est pas vrai, monsieur.
Allez immÃ©diatement porter votre copie
Ã  monsieur le directeur.
Tenez, accompagnez-le.
Et dites-lui que je ne veux plus
vous revoir d'ici la fin du trimestre.
Mais qu'est-ce qui te prend ?
Il n'a pas copiÃ©. J'Ã©tais assis
Ã  cÃ´tÃ© de lui, je l'aurais vu.
Vous voulez Ãªtre exclu, vous aussi ?
Ãa me dÃ©plairait pas.
Encore une insolence !
Sortez !
Je veux bien Ãªtre puni,
mais pas sortir. Oh lÃ  lÃ .
- Foutez-moi le camp.
- Ãa c'est pas lÃ©gal.
C'est pas... Je vais vous montrer
qui fait la loi ici !
C'est pas lÃ©gal, hein ?
C'est pas lÃ©gal !
Alors, vous l'avez emmenÃ©
chez monsieur le directeur ?
- Non, il s'est sauvÃ©.
- Il s'est sauvÃ© ?
Je lui ai foutu un coup de poing
dans la gueule et je me suis tirÃ©.
Je voulais pas aller chez le directeur,
il m'aurait foutu une talÃ©e.
Et toi, qu'est-ce qui s'est passÃ©
avec Petite Feuille ?
Il Ã©tait vachement furax.
Il m'a renvoyÃ© jusqu'Ã  aprÃ¨s NoÃ«l.
Ah, la vache, pauvre vieux, va.
Tu parles, aprÃ¨s un coup pareil,
je peux pas retourner Ã  la maison.
Mon pÃ¨re, il a dit qu'il me mettrait
au PrytanÃ©e.
- PrytanÃ©e ? Je connais pas.
- Ãa doit Ãªtre un truc militaire.
T'auras un uniforme.
Puis dans l'armÃ©e, il y a de l'avenir.
Oui, bien sÃ»r.
TrÃ¨s peu pour moi.
Si Ã§a pouvait Ãªtre dans la marine.
Je voudrais bien voir la mer,
j'y suis jamais allÃ©.
Je connais la Manche,
je connais l'Atlantique,
la MÃ©diterranÃ©e.
Je connais pas la Mer du Nord.
Allez, viens. Tu vas habiter chez moi,
on se dÃ©brouillera.
Chut !
Ah, la vache. Un cheval !
Il est Ã  mon pÃ¨re,
c'est un souvenir.
Ah, c'est mÃ©chamment grand
chez toi.
Aide-moi Ã  dÃ©barrasser le divan.
Tu dormiras lÃ , incognito.
- Et tes parents ?
- Ils ne viennent jamais ici.
Ma mÃ¨re picole et mon pÃ¨re
passe son temps aux courses.
On entre ici comme dans un moulin.
Pour avoir du fric,
il faudrait monter une affaire.
Oui, c'est Ã§a,
il faudrait du fric.
C'est une question
de fric au dÃ©part.
Oui, c'est une question de fric
au dÃ©part.
En attendant, suis-moi, je vais prendre
une petite avance sur mon hÃ©ritage.
Ne fais pas de bruit. Ma mÃ¨re
doit Ãªtre quelque part par lÃ .
Il y a quelqu'un ?
Bonjour, madame !
Petit malheureux, va !
Est-ce que tu as vu ta mÃ¨re
ces temps-ci ?
Aujourd'hui, quand je suis rentrÃ©
de l'Ã©cole.
Hum... Elle s'est arrangÃ©e
pour que ses horaires
ne coÃ¯ncident pas avec les miens.
Elle doit prÃ©parer
un mauvais coup.
OÃ¹ sont les fruits ?
Tiens, prends Ã§a.
Tiens.
Oh, diable ! 9h30, je vais
Ãªtre en retard au cercle.
Magne-toi un peu,
on va rater les actualitÃ©s.
Je sais, inspecteur. J'ai violÃ©
tous les articles de votre code
et vous allez me boucler
pour le restant de mes jours.
Aller quand mÃªme, ce soir, faire
un tour, vers 8h, chez le vieux Ãlie.
Vous risquez d'y rencontrer votre
petit copain aux dards empoisonnÃ©s.
Oh, la vache, j'ai soif.
Ah, le con, elle est dÃ©jÃ  vide.
Grouille-toi de jouer.
Qu'est-ce que t'as jouÃ©, toi ?
Douze !
Deux, quatre, six,
huit, dix, douze.
Dix.
VoilÃ  le vieux !
Aide-moi Ã  secouer les couvertures
Ã  cause de la fumÃ©e.
Ãa va, Ã§a suffit.
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Mais c'est une vraie tabagie lÃ -dedans.
On se croirait dans un tripot,
ma parole.
Bon, bon, je te retiendrai trois cigares
sur ton argent de poche.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que Ã§a ?
BucÃ©phale n'est pas un dÃ©potoir.
Ãa vaut au moins prÃ¨s d'un million,
ce truc-lÃ .
C'est une Åuvre d'art.
Du reste, je ne m'en sÃ©parerai
qu'en toute derniÃ¨re extrÃ©mitÃ©.
Bon, maintenant, tu vas
me faire le plaisir de tout Ã©teindre
et de t'endormir.
- Bonsoir, papa.
- Bonne nuit.
- HÃ©, pas mal.
- Oh ! Bien, vieux !
Oh, terrible.
Passe-moi ton guide Michelin.
Un million,
Ã§a fait vachement l'affaire.
C'est le cheval de mon pÃ¨re. AprÃ¨s
Ã§a, il serait capable de nous tuer.
Avec un million,
on se tire Ã  la plage,
on monte une affaire de bateaux
sans que personne s'occupe de nous.
Promenons-nous dans les bois...
Non ! Tu vas voir Ã§a,
vilain loup.
- Il s'agit de savoir ce qu'on veut.
- Il y en a quelques-unes
- dans le bureau de mon pÃ¨re.
- Il faut pas se dÃ©gonfler.
On pourra jamais les revendre,
elles sont numÃ©rotÃ©es.
Pas les revendre,
les mettre au Mont-de-PiÃ©tÃ©.
Ma mÃ¨re a foutu toute la baraque
au Mont-de-PiÃ©tÃ©.
Veux-tu me lÃ¢cher ? Ah !
Ha ! Ha ! Ãa y est.
Au loup !
Ah, te voilÃ , toi !
Vilain loup, prends Ã§a.
Ãa y est ! Ha ! Ha !
Bravo ! Bravo, Guignol.
Dans mes bras,
Petit Chaperon rouge.
Mais dis donc, et mÃ¨re-grand ?
Il faut que je te quitte,
voilÃ  tes clients. Salut.
- Combien ?
- 10%.
- D'accord.
- Mille tout de suite.
Ah non, quand vous reviendrez.
Oh lÃ  lÃ , la confiance rÃ¨gne.
HÃ©, monsieur !
Rendez-nous notre machine !
Dites donc, il faut pas
vous tirer comme Ã§a.
- J'aurais jurÃ© que vous Ã©tiez par lÃ .
- Oui, bien sÃ»r.
Ãa a pas marchÃ©.
Il faut pouvoir montrer la facture.
- Rendez-nous notre machine.
- D'accord, mais y a le dÃ©rangement.
- Disons 500 balles.
- On les a pas.
Vous avez bien
un petit quelque chose.
- Tiens, 300 et on n'en parle plus.
- Ah non.
On a pas un rond,
donnez-nous notre machine.
Je travaille pas pour rien. Tant pis
pour vous, je la garde en dÃ©pÃ´t.
Elle est Ã  nous, la machine.
Rendez-nous notre machine
ou bien je vous fais--
Bas les pattes, lÃ . Elle est pas
plus Ã  vous qu'Ã  moi, compris ?
VoilÃ  un agent.
On pourrait peut-Ãªtre lui demander.
C'est bon. Gardez-le,
votre engin.
Petits merdeux.
- J'en ai marre de la porter !
- Chacun son tour.
Mon pÃ¨re va se douter
que c'est moi qui l'ai piquÃ©e.
- Tu en as eu l'idÃ©e.
- C'est toi, salaud.
- Ãa alors !
- Je m'en fous, je la laisse tomber.
- T'es pas tombÃ© sur la tÃªte, non ?
- De toute faÃ§on,
il faut que je retourne au bureau
du vieux la reporter.
Je vais mettre un chapeau.
Si le concierge me voit,
il dira qu'il a vu passer un homme.
Sois pas vache,
rapporte-la Ã  ma place.
Non, vieux, pas question.
C'est pas moi qui en ai eu l'idÃ©e.
D'accord, mais t'es quand mÃªme
un beau salaud.
Prends-la pendant que
je vais mettre mon chapeau.
Tu m'attendras devant la boutique.
Dis donc, t'es bien le fils Doinel, toi.
J'ai pas la berlue.
Pose Ã§a lÃ . C'est monsieur papa
qui va Ãªtre content, hein.
Moi qui me fais engueuler
parce que je surveille pas les entrÃ©es.
Tu vas me payer Ã§a.
Je te prÃ©viens, n'essaie pas
de me jouer la fille de l'air
parce que je connais la musique
et j'aime pas les petits malins
de ton espÃ¨ce.
Allo ? Oui, monsieur Doinel ?
Excusez-moi de vous dÃ©ranger
pendant votre confÃ©rence...
Oui... Ah non, il faudrait
que Ã§a soit vous qui montiez...
Oui...
Mettons que c'est une surprise,
mais pas agrÃ©able.
Touche pas le chapeau. VoilÃ .
Tu penses bien que je t'emmÃ¨ne pas
Ã  une partie de plaisir, non ?
Fini, la rigolade. Ta mÃ¨re et moi,
on va pouvoir dormir tranquilles.
Tu peux le regarder ton copain
puis tÃ¢che de t'en souvenir.
Parce que vous Ãªtes pas prÃ¨s
de vous revoir.
Ãa te mettra peut-Ãªtre
du plomb dans la tÃªte.
De toute faÃ§on,
Ã§a ne pouvait plus durer.
Si j'avais fait Ã§a Ã  ton Ã¢ge,
mon pÃ¨re m'aurait assommÃ© !
Je peux voir le commissaire ?
On a tout essayÃ©,
monsieur le commissaire,
la douceur, la persuasion,
les sanctions.
Remarquez, on l'a jamais battu.
Ãa, on peut pas dire.
Il y a des cas
oÃ¹ les bonnes vieilles mÃ©thodes...
Oui, bien sÃ»r. Seulement, c'est pas
notre genre Ã  sa mÃ¨re et Ã  moi.
- On le laissait plutÃ´t libre.
- Trop, peut-Ãªtre.
Non. Ãa, on peut pas dire
non plus.
Enfin, dans la mesure oÃ¹ on travaille
tous les deux. Vous savez ce que c'est.
Oui, je suis pÃ¨re de famille
moi aussi.
Il faut reconnaÃ®tre que parfois,
on ne s'y retrouve pas trÃ¨s bien.
Si seulement il avait voulu
se confier Ã  nous.
Mais pensez-vous, on lui parle,
il est ailleurs.
Tenez, vous croyez qu'il Ã©coute ?
Regardez comment je l'ai trouvÃ©,
avec la machine.
Allez savoir ce qui lui passe
par la tÃªte.
Cabanel ?
Voulez-vous me consigner
la dÃ©position de ce garÃ§on ?
Vagabondage et vol.
D'accord, patron.
Allez, viens.
Bon. Qu'est-ce que vous dÃ©cidez ?
Dans l'immÃ©diat, on peut pas le
reprendre Ã  la maison, il repartirait.
Je sais pas, si vous pouviez
le faire surveiller quelque part,
Ã  la campagne, par exemple.
Puis le faire travailler.
Parce qu'Ã  l'Ã©cole,
il ne veut plus rien fiche.
On peut essayer
le Centre d'observation.
C'est bien organisÃ©. Il y a des ateliers
oÃ¹ on travaille le bois et le fer.
Oui, c'est Ã§a,
Ã§a lui ferait du bien.
Ã condition qu'il y ait de la place,
bien entendu.
Et pour Ã§a, il faudra faire
une demande
en correction paternelle
pour que l'Ã©ducation surveillÃ©e
le prenne en charge.
Demain matin, on le prÃ©sentera
devant le juge du tribunal pour enfants.
Vous n'aurez qu'Ã  vous y trouver.
- Vous ou votre femme.
- Entendu.
Personne ne t'a vu
entrer dans l'immeuble ?
- Non.
- Ce mÃªme jour,
dÃ©clare avoir pÃ©nÃ©trÃ©
subrepticement...
...une machine Ã  Ã©crire.
Bon.
Tiens, signe ici.
- Oh, Charles !
- Chef ?
Vas-y, il est Ã  toi maintenant.
Allez, viens.
Par lÃ .
Je te le passe parce que je rentre.
D'accord.
Viens lÃ .
Qu'est-ce que tu as fait ?
Je me suis tirÃ© de chez moi.
Et vous ?
Oh, moi...
Tiens, voilÃ  les chÃ©ries.
Allez, allez, allez.
J'ai vu un commissariat dans un film
oÃ¹ c'Ã©tait drÃ´lement plus propre.
- Moi, j'en ai vu un plus sale.
- Moi, des plus gais.
Avance.
Votre carrosse est avancÃ©.
Enfile ton blouson.
Ceinture, lacets, vide tes poches.
Tu signeras lÃ .
Signe ici.
Ã la rigueur, on pourrait
essayer de le reprendre.
Pour Ã§a, il faudrait qu'il s'engage
Ã  changer du tout au tout.
Si seulement vous arriviez
Ã  lui faire peur,
- monsieur le juge.
- Ce n'est pas mon rÃ´le.
Nous n'avons aucun pouvoir
sur lui.
Ou peut-Ãªtre l'exercez-vous
de faÃ§on trop intermittente.
Dites-moi, est-il vrai que l'enfant
soit parfois restÃ© tout un week-end,
seul Ã  la maison ?
Mon mari s'occupe
d'un club automobile.
Il a pu nous arriver de laisser
le petit, seul Ã  la maison.
D'ailleurs, il dÃ©teste le sport.
Il prÃ©fÃ¨re s'enfermer des heures
au cinÃ©ma Ã  s'esquinter les yeux.
Votre mari, que pense-t-il de tout Ã§a ?
C'est son fils, aprÃ¨s tout.
Bien...
Non, justement. Il m'a Ã©pousÃ©e
quand le petit Ã©tait en bas Ã¢ge.
C'est tout Ã  son honneur.
Je n'aurais pas dÃ» vous dire Ã§a.
Mais si, au contraire.
Et rÃ©flexion faite, je crois
qu'il vaut mieux
que nous mettions l'enfant
en observation dans un centre.
Si Ã§a pouvait Ãªtre au bord de la mer,
monsieur le juge.
Madame, nous ne sommes
pas une colonie de vacances.
Je ferai de mon mieux,
selon les places disponibles.
L'enfant y restera deux ou trois mois,
le temps que je poursuive mon enquÃªte.
Ensuite, nous prendrons
une dÃ©cision.
Croyez-moi, ce dÃ©conditionnement
ne peut lui faire que du bien.
- Au revoir, monsieur le juge.
- Au revoir, madame.
Halte !
Ã droite, droite !
Rompez !
Rompez !
Pourquoi t'es tombÃ©, toi ?
- Bof... Et toi ?
- Moi, j'ai glissÃ©.
- J'ai piquÃ© une machine Ã  Ã©crire.
- Une machine Ã  Ã©crire ?
C'est pas intelligent, mon vieux.
T'Ã©tais sÃ»r de te faire coincer.
Elles sont numÃ©rotÃ©es,
les machines Ã  Ã©crire.
Tu vois le grand, lÃ -bas ?
Lui, il piquait des pneus
de voitures.
Ã chaque fois que je chialais
Ã  la maison,
mon pÃ¨re prenait son violon
et jouait un air en imitant mes pleurs.
Tout Ã§a pour m'emmerder.
Un jour, j'en ai eu marre.
J'ai attrapÃ© une crise de nerfs puis
pan ! je lui ai envoyÃ© dans les plumes.
T'as bien fait. J'aurais crevÃ©
mon vieux s'il m'avait fait Ã§a.
- Ah... regarde.
- Qui c'est, ce mec-lÃ  ?
Il s'est fait piquer. Il s'Ã©tait tirÃ©
il y a mÃªme pas une semaine.
- Je le connais, ce gars-lÃ .
- Qu'est-ce qu'on va lui faire ?
Ici, c'est pas interdit de s'Ã©vader.
C'est interdit de se faire prendre.
J'aimerais pas Ãªtre Ã  sa place.
- Sales flics.
- Ah, putain.
Mais il aurait pas dÃ» s'Ã©chapper.
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez lÃ  ?
Allez, deux par deux et que Ã§a saute !
Qu'est-ce que tu fous, toi, lÃ -bas ?
Allez, en avant !
Marche. Un, deux.
Un, deux. Un...
Gauche ! Gauche !
Gauche ! Gauche !
Un, deux. Un, deux.
Un, deux. Un, deux.
Montrez-moi le pain.
Ãa va.
Dis donc, tu l'as entamÃ©, toi.
Prends ton assiette et ton pain,
viens ici.
Pose Ã§a lÃ .
La droite ou la gauche ?
La gauche, monsieur.
Et on se tait.
Tiens, je t'ai apportÃ© Ã§a.
J'avais pariÃ©
que tu te ferais repiquer.
Tu vois, j'ai gagnÃ© mon pari.
Je m'en fous. Je me suis
tellement marrÃ© pendant cinq jours
que je suis prÃªt Ã  recommencer
Ã  la premiÃ¨re occase.
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez lÃ  ?
Kanayan, chez la psychologue.
Si elle laisse tomber son crayon,
ramasse-le,
mais regarde pas ses jambes.
Sinon, c'est marquÃ© sur ton dossier.
Dossier ? Mais quel dossier ?
C'est ce qu'on sait sur toi,
c'est ce que pense le docteur,
ce que pense le juge, mÃªme ce que
pensent les voisins de tes parents.
Mon dossier, je le connais par cÅur.
Je sais qu'il y a marquÃ©
que je suis un instable psychomoteur
Ã  tendances perverses.
Si je dis des conneries, exprÃ¨s,
comme Ã§a, pour dÃ©conner ?
LÃ , t'es bon pour Sainte-Anne.
Ã Sainte-Anne, on te fait passer
le 38e parallÃ¨le.
- Le 38e parallÃ¨le ?
- Doinel.
Pourquoi as-tu
rapportÃ© la machine ?
Parce que comme je pouvais pas
la revendre,
comme je pouvais rien en faire,
j'ai eu peur.
Je sais pas, je l'ai rapportÃ©e.
Je sais pas pourquoi, comme Ã§a.
Dis-moi, il paraÃ®t que tu as volÃ©
10 000 francs Ã  ta grand-mÃ¨re.
Elle m'avait invitÃ©.
C'Ã©tait le jour de son anniversaire.
Comme elle est vieille, elle mange pas
beaucoup puis elle garde tout son argent.
Elle n'en aurait pas eu besoin ;
elle allait bientÃ´t mourir.
Comme je connaissais sa planque,
j'ai Ã©tÃ© lui faucher... des ronds.
Je savais bien
qu'elle s'en apercevrait pas.
La preuve, c'est qu'elle s'en est
pas aperÃ§ue.
Elle m'avait offert un beau bouquin
ce jour-lÃ .
Alors, ma mÃ¨re...
elle avait l'habitude
de fouiller dans mes poches.
Le soir, j'avais mis mon pantalon
sur mon lit.
Elle est sans doute venue
puis elle a fauchÃ© les ronds.
Le lendemain, je ne les ai plus trouvÃ©s.
Elle m'en a parlÃ©.
J'ai Ã©tÃ© bien forcÃ© d'avouer
que je les avais pris Ã  ma grand-mÃ¨re.
Ã ce moment-lÃ , elle m'a confisquÃ©
le beau livre
que ma grand-mÃ¨re m'avait donnÃ©.
Un jour, je lui ai demandÃ©
parce que je voulais le lire.
Je me suis aperÃ§u
qu'elle l'avait revendu.
Tes parents disent
que tu mens tout le temps.
Bien... je mens de temps
en temps, quoi.
Des fois, je leur dirais des choses
qui seraient la vÃ©ritÃ©,
ils me croiraient pas,
alors je prÃ©fÃ¨re dire des mensonges.
Pourquoi n'aimes-tu pas ta mÃ¨re ?
Parce que d'abord,
j'ai Ã©tÃ© en nourrice.
Quand ils n'ont plus eu d'argent,
ils m'ont mis chez ma grand-mÃ¨re.
Ma grand-mÃ¨re, elle vieillit,
elle ne pouvait plus me garder.
Je suis venu chez mes parents
Ã  ce moment-lÃ . J'avais dÃ©jÃ  huit ans.
Je me suis aperÃ§u que ma mÃ¨re
ne m'aimait pas tellement.
Elle me disputait toujours pour rien,
des petites affaires insignifiantes.
Aussi, quand il y avait des scÃ¨nes
Ã  la maison,
j'ai entendu que...
que ma mÃ¨re...
elle m'avait eu
quand elle Ã©tait...
elle m'avait eu fille-mÃ¨re.
Avec ma grand-mÃ¨re aussi,
elle s'est disputÃ©e une fois.
LÃ , j'ai su qu'elle avait voulu
me faire avorter.
Si je suis nÃ©, c'Ã©tait grÃ¢ce
Ã  ma grand-mÃ¨re.
As-tu dÃ©jÃ  couchÃ© avec une fille ?
Non, jamais. Mais je connais
des copains qui y sont allÃ©s.
Ils m'avaient dit :
"Si t'as vachement envie,
t'as qu'Ã  aller rue Saint-Denis.
LÃ , il y a des filles."
J'y suis allÃ© puis j'ai demandÃ©
Ã  des filles.
Je me suis fait
vachement engueuler,
alors j'ai eu la trouille
puis je suis parti.
Je suis revenu encore,
plusieurs fois.
Comme j'attendais dans la rue,
il y a un type qui m'a remarquÃ©.
Il a dit : "Qu'est-ce que tu fous lÃ  ?"
C'Ã©tait un Nord-Africain.
Je lui ai expliquÃ©. Il connaissait sans
doute les filles parce qu'il m'a dit :
"J'en connais une qui va...
une jeune qui va
avec les jeunes gens."
Il m'a emmenÃ© Ã  l'hÃ´tel
oÃ¹ elle Ã©tait.
Justement, ce jour-lÃ ,
elle n'y Ã©tait pas.
On a attendu une heure,
deux heures.
Comme elle venait pas,
je me suis tirÃ©.
RenÃ© !
RenÃ© !
Bonjour.
Ne cherche pas ton pÃ¨re,
je suis venue seule. C'est par lÃ  ?
- Par ici.
- Ah bon.
Ta lettre personnelle a fait
beaucoup de peine Ã  ton pÃ¨re.
Tu as Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s naÃ¯f de croire
qu'il ne me la montrerait pas.
Contrairement Ã  certaines apparences,
nous formons un couple trÃ¨s uni.
Si j'ai connu une pÃ©riode
assez douloureuse dans ma vie,
c'Ã©tait pas trÃ¨s malin
de la lui rappeler.
C'est tout de mÃªme grÃ¢ce Ã  lui
que tu as un nom. Hein ?
Nous Ã©tions prÃªts...
Ã  tenter une expÃ©rience
en te reprenant Ã  la maison,
mais ce n'est plus possible
Ã  cause des ragots des voisins.
Tu as dÃ» te plaindre
dans tout le quartier.
C'est pas vrai, maman,
j'ai rien dit.
Remarque bien, j'ai l'habitude.
Toute ma vie, j'ai eu des imbÃ©ciles
contre moi.
VoilÃ , c'est tout
ce que j'avais Ã  te dire.
Inutile d'apitoyer ton pÃ¨re
en jouant les martyrs.
Il m'a chargÃ©e de te faire savoir
qu'il se dÃ©sintÃ©resse complÃ¨tement
de ton sort dÃ©sormais.
Tu es bon pour les enfants de troupes
ou le centre d'apprentissage.
Tu voulais gagner ta vie,
tu vas voir si c'est amusant
de travailler le bois et le fer.
$&$Manchester by the sea$&$
That makes all my actions
when I move through the world,
I do things better
cause I can see it
all laid out like a map.
Have you ever looked
at a map?
Yes, if I'm not mistaken.
Do you know how to read a map?
Do you know how
to read a map?
Yeah.
Your father's
a perfectly good guy,
but it is a lot of stuff
that he just doesn't understand
about the world that
I understand.
Listen, huh?
My dad...
I haven't asked you
a question, yet.
Listen.
Shh, don't tell you mother.
Shut up, be quiet.
Shush, be quiet.
I haven't asked you
the question, yet.
I haven't asked you anything.
Listen.
We got it.
Don't worry about it.
Listen.
If there was...
If you could take one guy
to an island with you
and you knew you'd be safe
cause he was the best man,
he was going to figure out
how to survive,
he was going
to make everything,
he was going to make the world
a good place on the island,
he was going
to keep you happy,
he, he...
This is the best man
for the job.
No matter what,
if it was between me
and your father,
who would you take?
My daddy.
I don't see...
Hang on a second.
Listen, I didn't think
you're wrong about that.
It's your choice to make,
but I want you to understand
something.
There's a lot of...
Hey.
What happened?
What is that?
You can't leave
your fish around like that.
I don't know why the hell
it keeps dripping.
All night long,
drip, drip, drip.
I've had the fucking thing
repaired ten times.
You need
a new stopper.
Is that it?
Well, your stopper,
it's rotted around the edges,
so it's not making a seal,
The water
is going to drip through
into the bowl.
I could bring you
a new one tomorrow,
or you might want to consider
replacing the whole apparatus.
What do you recommend?
I could replace
the stopper first.
If that doesn't work,
I could replace the whole
apparatus.
You can't give me
a professional recommendation?
I don't know.
It's really up to you.
Tomorrow my sister-in-law's
coming over with the nephews.
I got to take the car in.
Um...
No, it's my sister Janine's
oldest daughter's Bat Mitzvah.
I'm looking forward
to being bored to death.
The girl doesn't want it,
her father doesn't want it.
And don't even ask me.
Seven hours in the car.
I could really
slit my throat.
But, oh, well,
the little girls are charming.
Lee, I am so sorry.
That's okay.
This is so gross.
That's all right.
No, tell him to come.
Okay, yeah.
But-But Cindy,
I have to tell you something.
I'm like in love
with my janitor.
Is that sick?
Have you ever had
a sexual fantasy
about your handyman?
Well, it's awkward
because he's literally
like cleaning the shit out
of my toilet bowl
right now.
And I don't think
I'm at my most alluring.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
It's not like I met him socially.
Okay, thank you, Cindy.
Okay, like 20 minutes.
Bye.
All right, all set.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Can I give you a tip?
You mean
like a suggestion?
No, I mean, like, a tip.
Oh, okay.
Thank you.
Yeah, good night.
Good night.
Good bye.
I mean, how many times
do we have to fix
these fucking pipes?
Every time I take a shower,
their entire apartment
has a flood.
It's driving me insane.
Well, I'll get you a plumber
in here tomorrow,
but I'd say that we're going
to have to break through
the tile and isolate the leak
because there's quite a lot
of water down there.
How do you know it's me?
Why is it automatically me?
Well, because it if was coming
from higher up,
you'd have water damage
in your ceiling or in your wall,
and it's all dry.
Great.
Well, it might just be
the caulking.
This whole tub
needs to be re-caulked.
Have you taken a bath
or shower in the last
couple of hours?
Yes.
Well, it might just be that.
Okay.
And how are you planning
to find that out?
Well, we could run
the shower and see
if it drip downstairs.
Oh, you want me
to take a shower now?
No.
You want me to take
a shower right now while
you stand there
watching to see if it drips
into the Friedrich's apartment?
I don't give a fuck
what you do, Mrs. Olsen.
I'm just trying to fix
the fucking leak.
I... I didn't like that.
How dare you talk
to me like that?
Get the fuck out
of my fucking house.
Okay.
Get the fuck out
out of my fucking house
before I call the police.
All right.
Did you hear me?
I said get out.
I can't.
You're blocking the doorway.
What the fuck's
the matter with you?
You can't talk
to the tenants like that.
Look, Lee,
you do good work.
You're dependable
But I get these complaints
all the time.
You're rude,
you're unfriendly,
you won't say good morning.
I mean, come on.
Mr. Emery,
I fix the plumbing.
I take out the garbage.
I paint their apartments.
I do electrical work,
which we both know
is against the law.
I show up on time,
I'm working four buildings,
and you're getting
all the money.
So do whatever
you're going to do.
Would you be willing
to apologize to Mrs. Olsen?
For what?
All right, all right,
I'll talk to her.
Here you go.
Thanks.
How you doing?
Good.
How's things going,
all right?
Yeah.
You see the game?
Yeah, I did.
You think
they have a shot'?
No.
Not one.
Dropped the first two,
they're going to lose
the next three.
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Did I get you?
Yes.
I got you.
It's okay.
Let me get you
some napkins.
I'm okay.
Hey, Lenny,
can I grab some napkins?
Thanks.
Thank you.
Here.
Thanks.
Well, now I spilled my beer
all over you, my name's Sharon.
Uh, that's okay.
And you are...
Um, Lee.
âª There's a bright âª
âª Golden haze âª
âª In the meadow âª
âª There's a bright âª
âª Golden haze âª
âª In the meadow âª
âª The corn is as high âª
âª As an elephant's eye âª
âª And it looks like
It's climbing âª
âª Clear up to the sky âª
âª Well I say oh âª
âª What a beautiful mornin' âª
âª I've got a beautiful feelin' âª
âª Everything âª
âª Everything's goin' my way âª
How you doing?
How you doing?
I'm good.
I'm good.
Hey, can I ask you, guys,
do you know me?
Uh... I don't think so.
No, I don't think so, either.
We never met?
No, not yet.
No.
No.
So, what the fuck
you looking at me for?
Excuse me?
I said what the fuck
are you looking at me for?
Hey, take a fucking walk...
No, no, no, don't apologize
to this asshole.
We really weren't looking
at you, seriously.
Let me go.
I got to go take a hike.
I want to take
a fucking hike.
âª I got a beautiful feelin' âª
âª I've got everything âª
âª Everything's goin' my way âª
âª Everything's goin' my way âª
âª My wayâª
Where do you think
he went' left'?
Other left he went'.
Ten points,
San Antonio lead.
Isaiah Thomas
been so good this season.
Knocks down
that three pointer.
Hello, this is Lee.
Oh. Okay.
When did that happen?
Well, how's he doing now?
No, don't do that.
I'm going to come
up there right now.
I'll be up there
in a hour and a half.
Okay?
Thank you.
Bye.
Mr. Emery,
it's Lee again.
I contacted Jose,
who says he can cover for me
till Friday night at least.
Uh, after that,
Gene MacAdavey
will take over until I get back.
I wouldn't do anything
with Mr. and Mrs. Fredrick's
ceiling
until you get
a real plumber in there.
But what
are you going to do?
I will let you know
a soon as I have
more information.
I should be in Manchester
a week at least.
Thank you very much.
Bye.
Come on.
Go.
Hiya, Lee.
Is he dead?
I'm sorry, Lee.
He passed away
about an hour ago.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
Did you see him?
No, I mean, uh...
George brought him in.
We were looking
at the boat this morning,
and the he just...
I don't know,
he just, like, fell over.
I thought he was
kidding me at first.
Then I called
the ambulance,
and, uhâ.
That was it.
I'll just call Dr. Muller
and tell him that you're here.
Where's Dr. Betheny?
Oh, she's on maternity leave.
Here he is.
Lee?
I'm Dr. Muller.
We spoke on the phone.
Yeah. Hi.
I'm very, very sorry.
Thank you.
Hello, George.
Hiya, Jim.
How you holding up?
Oh...
Great, you know.
It's a very sad day.
Yeah.
Where's my brother?
He's downstairs.
You can see him
if you want.
What happened to him?
Went into cardiac arrest.
You know his heart
was very weak at this point,
and it just gave out.
I'm sorry you didn't get here
in time, but as I told you
on the phone...
Aw, fuck this.
Sorry.
That's okay, buddy.
That's perfectly all right.
Did anybody call my uncle?
His Uncle Donny.
Ah.
Yeah, my Aunt and Uncle...
No, Lee.
Lee, no.
Donny got a job
in Minnesota, like,
a while ago.
Minnesota?
He got a job
in some outfit
in Minnetonka, Minnesota.
If you can believe that.
Joe didn't tell you
about that?
No.
I can call them
if you want, Lee.
Tell them
what happened.
Okay, thanks.
Oh, no problem.
And tell him
what happened.
Tell them
I'll call them tonight.
Talk about arrangements.
Somebody should call
my wife.
Your, uh...
Ex-wife.
You mean Randi?
Randi.
Yes, I'm sorry.
I meant Randi.
I already thought' of that'-
I'll take care of it'.
Okay, thank you.
No problem.
Can I see him now?
Sure.
Lee, I can wait up here, Lee,
if you need anything.
Okay.
Thanks.
Would you like a Kleenex?
Yeah.
Thanks, yeah.
Can I get a couple
Kleenex please?
Thanks, hun.
I'm sorry.
Oh, please.
Haw is; Dr. Bethany?
Oh, she's doing very well.
She just had twin girls.
Ah, Irene told me that.
Yeah.
I'll call her this afternoon
and tell her what happened.
She was very good to him.
Yes, she was.
The disease
is commonly referred to
as congestive heart failure.
Oh, my God.
Are you familiar with it?
No.
Then what are you saying
Oh, my God for?
Because what is it?
What she's trying
to explain, honey...
I'm sorry, Dr. Beth...
Betheny.
Betheny, I'm sorry.
I can never get it right.
Not a problem.
So... you were saying.
It's a gradual deterioration
of the muscles of the heart.
It's usually associated
with older people,
but in rare cases it will occur
in a younger person.
Some people live up
to 50 or 60 years
with just
an occasional attack,
but most people
suffer periodic episodes,
like the one
you had on Monday.
Which mimic the symptoms
of a heart attack in which further
weaken the muscle.
They can put' you
out of commission
for a week, two weeks,
and you'll need
to be hospitalized so that
we can monitor your heart
because the risk
of cardiac arrest is elevated
for a week or two.
Oh, my God.
But in between
most people feel
perfectly healthy.
You can basically live
a normal life.
Wait, so what do you mean
some people live to be 50,
60 years?
I mean, you saying total?
Or you saying
when they're diagnosed
with this, or what?
What are you saying?
Tell me the fucking truth.
Total.
For most people
with the particulars
of your condition,
the average life expectancy
is five to ten years.
The statistics vary widely.
You're not a statistic,
you're just one person.
And we don't know
what's going to happen
to you, yet.
But it's not
a good disease.
What is a good disease?
Poison Ivy.
Athlete's foot.
It's a comedy routine.
Elise, please.
For Christ's sake.
Oh, my God,
when am I going
to put one foot right?
How about a hint?
Elise.
Daddy.
What?
No, she's fine.
We're all upset.
We're all going to listen.
We're going to ask
any of the question
we want' to ask,
and then we're going
to figure out what to do
together, right?
Sure.
So, you were saying Dr. Beth.
It's Dr. Bethany, Dad.
Try to get it right.
I do not see
where the humor lies
in this situation.
Elise, you must calm down.
No.
No, no more,
I'm not going... no.
Elise, let me get you
a glass of water.
Daddy, forget it.
Forget it.
Forget it.
Like you...
Everybody should be
just like you.
You know what?
I'm tired of being
the bad guy here.
Who's in the fucking
hospital here?
Right, so I'll be
the bad guy,
and you be in the hospital
and explain the jokes
to your son.
I'm going home.
You're going home?
- You're going home?
- Yes.
Let me get her back.
Fuck her.
You want to stop
with that shit?
Come on with that stuff.
Thank you, Tony.
I have to get up to Manchester.
Nobody told Patrick right?
No, you had asked for us
to wait for you to get here.
Yes, thank you.
So, um...

Well, now you have
to make arrangements
with the funeral parlor,
and they pretty much
take care of everything.
I don't know
the name of one.
That's all right.
We can help you with that.
Oh, yeah.
Then they'll just come
and pick him up?
Yeah.
I can make
those calls, Lee.
Let me know if you need
any help with anything.
Okay, thank you.
We've got to talk
about the boat
and the website
and all of that.
Sure.
I'm around.
I got to get up there
before school lets out so...
You just have to sign
for Joe's belongings.
Right this way.
Just got to sign
right here.
Where's Joe's belongings?
The plastic bag right here.
Give me a sec.
Where's Joe's belongings?
All right, all right,
that's good, hold.
Like that?
Yeah, but keep your thumb off the line.
If you get a strike,
it's going to slice it
right open.
You know
what happens then.
What'?
Sharks will smell the blood
and they'll rip this boat apart.
No, they won't.
Yeah, they will.
Dad, will they?
Yes, sir.
Shut up.
You know, I've seen
a school of sharks
tear a boat to pieces
like it was made
of cardboard,
because some kid
threw a band-aid
in the water.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he did.
Oh, yeah.
No, you didn't.
Sometimes the only way
to keep them off
is to throw the kid
directly in the ocean
to distract them.
Shut up.
Sharks don't even
swim in schools.
Huh?
He says sharks
don't swim in schools.
Smart kid.
Yeah, he is.
A really smart kid
is exactly the kind
of quality meal
a humongous school
of sharks is looking for
when they're circling a boat.
Uncle Lee,
shut up.
Hey, you got a strike.
Strike, strike, strike.
Ease up on the drag,
ease up on your drag.
Watch your fucking thumb.
Hey, you got a strike now.
Don't hit me,
catch your fish.
No swearing.
You got a strike.
I got him, we got him.
Drive the boat, mind
your business.
You got to get
the hook in him.
Shut up.
Mind your business.
What kind of fish is it?
It's got to be
a Great White.
It's got to be
a Great White Patty.
Maybe a barracuda.
It's not a shark.
Come on, pull it up.
It's not a shark.
Stop talking...
How come that's
connected to those?
It's not, kid.
It just looks that way.
I'm trying
to teach you the islands.
That's the island the rich guy
bought so no one else will put
a house on it.
That's how rich he is.
Baker Island, Misery Island.
Misery Island is where me
and your aunt Randi
got married.
Hello?
Yeah.
Hi, honey.
Suzy, Daddy's home.
Hi, Suzy.
Daddy's home.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hug.
Oh, Jesus Christ,
you're breaking my neck.
Wench;
Lee?
Yeah,
Hi, hon.
Hey,
Did you have a good time?
Yeah, really good.
Where's your mother?
They just left.
Oh, no.
Yeah, she's sad
to miss you, too.
There's always next time.
Did you get any sleep?
Oh, yeah.
It's all rest
when my mother's here.
That's too bad.
Hi, Kary.
Hi, Daddy.
Dad...
I'm putting you down.
Relax.
I'm just giving you a kiss.
Honey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, Karen.
Karen.
I almost dropped you

I'm making
a hair salon.
Oh, yeah?
It's really good.
You want to cut my hair?
It's just for girls.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I understand, sweetheart.
May I watch TV
to get some ideas?
Yeah-
No.
Go ahead.
Get off.
How you feeling?
Better.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You sound better.
So, did you guys actually
use the fishing tackle?
Yeah, we really did.
Patty got
a humongous bluefish.
Eighteen pounds.
Oh, yeah?
That's awesome.
I never seen anybody
so happy in my whole life.
Aww.
It's nice in here.
You keep it nice.
What a homemaker.
Fuck off.
All right.
Get away from me.
Stop it.
Mmm, don't.
Stop, please.
I'm sick.
Okay.
For real,
get off of me.
Hi, Stanny.
Oh, God.
Let him alone, please.
How come you're not crying?
I just got him settled.
Just got him settled?
What did you get him
settled for?
Lee, don't pick him up.
Oh, what do you mean
don't pick him up.
If he's not crying,
leave well enough alone.
Leave well enough alone.
That's what me and your Mummy
should've done instead
of getting married.
Oh, shut up.
Then you wouldn't be here.
Your sisters wouldn't be here.
I could watch the football game
in my own living room with peace
and quiet.
You know what?
You go fuck yourself.
Oh, jeez, Louise.
Hey, kiddo.
Oh, my God,
you're very handsome,
you know that?
See that?
I didn't make him cry.
Lay down.
Yeah.
He's not crying
cause I know
how to handle him.
How is he?
How's Joe?
He's fine.
You know,
he's all right.
He's doing all right.
And you didn't run out of beer?
You got through the day okay?
Oh, yeah.
We were very temperate.
I don't know
why you guys bother
getting on the frigging boat.
What do you mean?
Because we love the sea.
Oh, yeah?
How many beers
did you have on the sea?
Eight.
Eight?
Yep, eight
over a seven-hour period.
Which...
Well, I am well impressed.
...is...
1.1428572 beers an hour.
What, it's like
you didn't even have
anything to drink at all.
Yeah, I told you
I was cutting down.
Oh, God, no.
What do you think
you're going to do?
I guess I'm going
to take a shower.
Randi, I swear to God.
His;
He was so happy.
It was like
when we took the girls
on the Merry Go Round.
It was just pure happiness.
Oh.
Oh, come on, I'm sick.
I'm sick.
I'm really...
Really, babe,
deeply sick.
It actually makes it
hard to breathe.
He's not at school?
I thought school let out...
I'm pretty sure
he would have...
What?
I'm sorry.
Paul, my phone is...
Sorry, say that again.
That's all right.
I'm pretty sure
he would've left for hockey
practice by now.
He's on the hockey team?
Yeah, yeah.
He's doing real well, too.
Hey, how's Joe doing?
He going to be okay?
Yeah, he's fine.
Where's the practice?
Is it at the school?
No, they practice
at Gloucester.
They practice
in the Gloucester...
I'm sorry,
it's not at the school?
No.
What'?
Can you hear me?
The phone...
That's all right.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
It's at Gloucester, okay?
I understand.
Yeah, we play
with the Rockport team.
But they're the league team.
Okay, I understand.
Thank you, Paul.
Yeah, sure thing.
Hey, give Joe
my regards, all right?
I will.
What's up?
Uh, Joe Chandler's
in the hospital again.
Oh, how awful.
Yeah.
Who was on the phone?
That was Lee Chandler.
Lee Chandler?
The very one.
Hey.
Hey, hey.
Knock it off.
Chandler.
Knock it off.
One more time
and you're out.
You understand that, Chandler?
One more time.
Aw, fuck me.
What's that?
Fuck my fucking ass.
All right, you are out.
Chandler, you're benched.
All right.
Ask me if I give a shit.
What's that?
Coach, that's his uncle.
His father
must be in the hospital.
Whose father?
Chandler's?
Yeah, he only comes around
when Mr. Chandler's
in the hospital.
He's got' congestive
heart' failure-
Patrick's dad.
$0 that's Lee Chandler?
The Lee Chandler, huh?
Yeah, but coach,
you know that story's
bullshit, right?
Total bullshit, coach.
You guys want to watch
the language?
Sorry.
All right mind,
your own business
for a little while, huh?
Take a break.
Get a water.
All right, show's over.
Come on, let's go, let's go.
You all right, brother?
Take these sticks back,
would you?
Line it' up again.
Come on, let's go.
I have to go to the hospital
and sign some more papers.
Do you want to see him?
I don't know-
Why?
What does he look like?
He looks like he's dead.
I mean, he doesn't look
like he's sleeping, or anything.
But he doesn't look
gross, either.
I don't know.
Well... you don't have to.
I wanted to see him.
Maybe you don't want
that image in your memory.
I don't...
It's up to you.
What do you want to do?
Want me to take you home?
You want me
to decide for you?
Let's just go.
What the fuck
are you doing?
I just said
let's go inside.
No, you just said,
Let's just go, and then
you get out of the car...
Okay, I meant let's go inside.
What's your problem?
My problem is I could've ripped
your fucking leg off.
Okay, I'm sorry
I misused the English language.
I'm sorry, Uncle Lee.
I'm sorry, too.
I just got scared.
Yep. Okay.
Thank you.
Of course.
You got to hit
the bleeper.
I don't have a bleeper.
I'll do it.
There's a code.
Hey, is it okay
if I invite some
of my friends over?
I told them
I would call them.
Go ahead.
And can we get some pizza?
There's nothing to eat here.
Okay.
What kind would you like?
Any kind is fine.
Thank you.
At least he didn't suffer.
It's worse for the family,
but it's better for the person.
Well, he was a fucking
great guy, Patrick,
I'll tell you that.
That's for sure.
You know, I remember
this one time he...
He took us all
out in the boat,
like in sixth grade.
Yeah, I remember that.
And he made us wear
life preservers.
And I was like, you know,
"What's the difference,
Mr. Chandler?"
The boat sinks in this weather,
we're dead anyways.
Yeah, I remember that.
And then he was like...
"The life jacket's to make it
easier on the sharks
when you go over."
Fucking smart ass,
I swear to God.
Yeah, he really liked
those shark jokes.
He was funny, man.
Yeah.
He was gentle, too,
you know?
Like his son.
There's this former
starship captain, all right?
This former starship captain...
With the Star Trek again?
Will you shut the fuck up?
Fuck you.
Star Trek sucks.
You fucking retard.
Star Trek is one
of the classical pillars
of modern entertainment.
Tell me about Star Trek,
enlighten me, motherfucker.
I'll tell you this.
How long have I been
friends with you?
How you doing, baby?
I'm okay.
Enough is enough, okay?
It' just' started.
How dare you?
Will you shut up?
Fuck Star Trek-
Every sci-fi classic film
you like is based on Star Trek-
Star Trek is bullshit.
Star Trek
I's retarded.
Then Road Warrior,
Then the Matrix.
Retarded as shit.
I love Star Trek, all right?
How dare you.
Ask Patrick.
He loves them.
Patrick, what do you think
about Star Trek?
Ask Patrick.
I can't believe we're talking
about Star Trek right now.
I like Star Trek.
Thank you.
Hey, Uncle Lee.
Is it okay
if Silvie sleeps over?
Dad always let her.
Then what
are you asking me for?
No reason.
Thanks.
Uh, not that
it would come up
or anything,
but her parents think
she stays downstairs
when she stays over.
If it comes up for some reason,
can you just say she stayed
in the downstairs room?
I don't even know them.
Yeah, you do.
It's the McGanns.
Frank and Pat McGann.
Oh, that's Silvie McGann?
Yeah.
Okay.
So...
Do you mind saying
she stayed downstairs?
Like, if they call
or something?
Okay.
Am I supposed to tell you
to use a condom?
No, I...
Is that what Joe would say?
No.
I mean, yeah.
Yeah, we've had
the discussion
and everything.
So...
Okay, good.
Yeah, just let me know
if we're making too much noise.
Okay.
Uh...
Do you think
I should call my morn
to tell her about Dad?
No, I wouldn't, Patty.
Yeah.
I mean, uh, nobody
even knows where she is.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I was just curious
what you thought.
Anyway...
Good night, Uncle Lee.
Good night.
Shut up.
Hey, shut' up, shut' up-
Hey, Elise.
Shit.
Hey.
Come on.
Lee, you want to take Patty
upstairs and get him washed up?
Come on, kid.
Go on now.
Everything will be all right.
I'll be up in a minute.
Go on upstairs, Patty.
Everything will be okay.
I thought it was wonderful
that you dropped that ball.
Oh, shit.
Go on.
Shut the fuck up.
Beverly, Massachusetts.
Gallagher Funeral Home please.
Morning.
Hi.
Yes, hi, my name
is Lee Chandler.
My brother Joseph Chandler
is at the Beverly Hospital
morgue.
I'm wondering
who I need to talk to
about making arrangements.
Yeah, thank you.
Yes.
Yes, I just spoke...
Yes, my name
is Lee Chandler.
My brother's
at the Beverly Hospital morgue.
Yes.
Okay.
I understand.
I'm...
I'm calling to find out
exactly what I need to do
to make arrangements
for the next step.
I see.
Okay, thank you.
Can I have a napkin?
Yes.
That's right.
But what do you I got
to do to get his...
To get his body over to...
Excuse me, Mr. Chandler.
I don't think Patrick needs
to be here for this.
No, I'm all right.
I don't understand.
So why is it more to drive
his body to Manchester?
You going to take
the high way for seven minutes,
that's why it' costs more?
What does it cost
if the hearse takes 127?
Jesus.
Like, that's his focus?
He's all right.
Thanks, Uncle Lee.
You're welcome.
Thanks, Mr. Chandler.
You're welcome.
So...
We're going to forget
about the language.
We're going to forget
about the fists.
But I want you take
a few days off of practice.
I don't want you
on the ice.
Well, to tell you
the honest truth, sir,
I could really use
the distraction.
The ice is not
a distraction.
When you're on the ice,
you got to be there.
Okay, so take a couple
days off and we'll talk.
Listen,
when I was your age,
I lost my dad, too.
So...
I know what
you're going through.
If you want
to come in and talk,
or you want somebody
to spill your guts to,
or throw the bull around,
the door's open.
You mind if I put
some music on?
No-
You like these guys?
The lead guitar is weak,
but otherwise they're
pretty good.
I don't know,
they all sound
the same to me.
Where we going?
Got to go to the lawyer.
What for?
Read your father's will.
Do I have to be there?
I don't think so, but I think
you're supposed to be.
Who do you think
he left the boat to?
I'm sure
he left you everything.
I don't understand.
Which... part are you
having trouble with?
Well, I can't be
his guardian.
Well...
Uh...
I mean I can't.
Well, naturally I assumed
that Joe had discussed
all this with you.
No.
He didn't.
No.
Sorry, I have to say
I'm somewhat taken aback.
He can't live with me.
I live in one room.
Well, but Joe has provided
for Patrick's upkeep.
Food, cloths, etcetera.
And the house and the boat
are owned outright.
I can't commute from Boston
every day until he turns 18.
I think the idea
was that you would relocate.
Relocate to where?
Here?
Well, if you look...
As you can see, your brother
worked everything out
extremely carefully.
But he can't...
He can't have meant that.
Uh, he's allowed
up to $5,000...
to pay
for moving expenses.
And there's a small amount'
set aside for you to draw from
as personal income
while you settle in.
I mean, assuming
that you accept.
What about my Uncle Donny
and Aunt Teresa?
Joe didn't feel that Patrick
really had any special
relationship or feeling.
I don't understand.
Now, as I think
you know, they've moved out
to Wisconsin, I believe.
Minnesota.
Minnesota
Minnetonka, Minnesota.
That's right.
It was my impression
that you'd spent a lot
of time here over the years.
I was just a backup.
I came up here
to look after Patty, yeah,
if Joe was in the hospital
after my father
couldn't do it.
We...
It was supposed
to be Donny.
I'm just a backup.
Well, I can just repeat
that I'm astonished
that Joe
didn't run this by you,
thorough as he was.
Yeah, because he knew
what I would say if he would
have asked.
Hey.
You want to keep it down,
you fucking morons?
My kids are sleeping.
I am so sorry.
I mean...
Lee, you want to get
these fucking pinheads
out of my house please?
Yeah, I do.
I mean, I really do.
She can't talk
to us that way.
Yeah.
Hey,
I'm not fucking around.
It's 2:in the fucking morning.
Get these fucking assholes
dressed and get them
the fuck out of here.
We're dressed.
She didn't mean it.
She'll apologize later.
They're already left.
Lee...
Thanks for hosting, kid-
Tell Randi we're sorry.
Drink and drive.
We're so sorry.
You see Jupiter?
Keep you eyes on the road.
Hey, Tommy.
Goodnight, Joe.
Sorry again.
Go ahead-
Shoot' for it', you fucking idiot'.
Look, there's the North Star
right there.
Right there.
It's due north.
I'll clean up
in the morning.
Did you see Jupiter,
you fucking asshole?
Come on.
Fuck you.
Come on.
Lee...
Lee, nobody can appreciate
what you've been through.
If I can say that'.
And if you really feel
like you can't take this on,
well, that's,
that's your right.
So who would get him?
Patrick, can I get you
a can of soda or anything?
No, thank you.
Well, I don't know
what's happening
with Patrick's mother.
No.
I'm not sure
where she is.
What kind
condition she's in.
No.
We can't do that.
Oh, God!
My kids are in there!
My kids are in there!
Oh, God!
Look, Leeâ.
Why don't you just...
Thank you, Wes.
I'll be in touch.
I'm-I'm here.
We were partying pretty hard.
There was beer.
And someone
was passing around a joint
and there was cocaine.
Cocaine?
Yes.
Okay, go ahead.
Uh, anyway,
our bedroom
is in the downstairs,
00:59:58,125 --> 01:60:-3600,and the kids
sleep upstairs,
so Randi makes
everyone leave
around 2:00...
or three AM.
And then...
she goes back to bed.
So, I go upstairs
to check on the kids,
and it's fucking freezing
up stairs,
but I can't use the central heat
because it dries out
Randi's sinuses,
and she gives her
really bad headaches.
So I go downstairs
and put a fire in the fireplace,
and I sit down to watch TV,
but there's no more beer.
I'm still jumping around
like a jackrabbit.
So I put a couple
fire logs in the fire
and I...
Just to warm up the house
when I was gone.
And then... l am going
to the mini-mart,
but I'm too wasted
and I don't want to drive.
So I walk.
It's about 20 minutes
each way.
And about halfway there,
and I can't remember
if I put the screen
on the fireplace.
I figure it's okay.
So I just keep going
to the store.
And, uh, that's it.
Log must've rolled out
onto the floor.
And the firemen said
they pulled Randi out.
She was passed out
downstairs.
And...
Then the furnace blew,
and they couldn't go
back in again.
And that's all
I remember.
Okay, Lee.
That's all for now.
We'll call you
if anything else comes up
we want to ask you about.
Assuming the forensics
bail you out,
which I'm assuming
they will...
So what?
That's it?
Look, Lee, you made
a horrible mistake.
Like a million
other people did last night.
Not going
to crucify you.
It's not a crime to forget
to put the screen
on the fireplace.
So I can go?
Unless something else
comes up we don't know about
already, yeah.
You got anyone to give you
a ride back home?
Is Joe here,
is your dad here?
Yeah.
Okay.
Please.
All right, let's go.
Bye.
Where are we going,
the orphanage?
Shut up.
What the hell did I do?
Just be quiet.
All right.
We got a lot to do.
What about the boat?
We got to talk
to George about it.
There's no use hanging onto it
if no one's going to use it.
I'm going to use it.
It's got to be maintained.
I'm maintaining it.
You can't maintain it
by yourself.
Why not?
It's my boat now, isn't it?
Because you're a minor.
You can't take it out alone.
I'm the trustee.
So what does "trustee" mean?
I'm in charge
of handling everything
for you until you turn 18.
Does that mean
you're allowed to sell it
if I don't want you to?
I don't know.
But I'd definitely consider it.
No fucking way.
Don't be
so goddamn sure of yourself.
There's nobody to run it.
You're 16 years old.
I get my license this year.
Doesn't matter.
You're still a minor.
You can't run
a commercial vessel by yourself.
It's a big fucking expense.
I'm the one who's going
to manage it, and I'm not
going to be here.
Who gives a fuck
where you are?
Patty, I swear to God,
I'm going to knock
your fucking block off.
Great parenting.
What?
What did you say?
I said great parenting.
Fuck you.
Mind your fucking business,
fucking asshole.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm going to smash
your fucking face,
you fucking asshole.
It's okay, it's okay.
Thank you, thank you.
It's okay.
Uncle Lee, are you
fundamentally unsound?
Fucking asshole.
Get in the fucking car.
I can't obey your orders
until you unlock the door.
Shut up.
It's not' like the motor's
going to die tomorrow,
but Joe said
it keeps breaking down
like a son of a bitch.
Yeah, but we...
We were going
to take a look at it
this weekend.
Things are
a little bit up in the air.
No, I can take care of it
as far as general maintenance
is concerned.
But that motor's going
to go at some point.
I'm taking care of it.
There's no allotment
for a new motor.
Unless, George, you know
someone who wants to buy it.
Wait a second.
I'm not selling it.
We're going to be
in Boston anyway.
What?
Since when are we supposed
to be in Boston?
Just take it easy.
Well, whatever you decide,
it's going to bleed you dry
just sitting here.
We don't know exactly
we're doing.
Well, you know, he can always
stay with us if he wants
to come up weekends.
Do you want to be
his guardian?
Well...
He doesn't want
to be my guardian.
We're trying to lose
some kids at this point.
We're just
working out logistics.
That's pretty good.
Jesus Christ,
you want to stop?
We've always got
a sofa for him.
You know that, right'?
George, that's all right.
I know that.
He's welcome any time.
I know.
Thank you.
Are you brain-damaged?
You can't just talk
to people that.
You don't want
to be my guardian,
that's fine with me.
It's not that.
It's just the logistics.
I just got to work it
all out, I swear.
How?
By sending me
to Wonkatonka, Minnesota
with Uncle Donny?
Minnetonka, Minnesota.
Okay, Minnetonka, Minnesota.
Same difference.
What about my mother?
The judge would never
let that happen.
And anyway,
no one knows where she is.
I do.
She's in Connecticut.
At least she was last year.
Since when
do you know that?
Well, she emailed me
last year.
So I emailed her back.
You know, email?
Did your father know
you were in touch with her?
Are you kidding?
Could we walk?
I'm freezing.
All I know is...
I know, I know, I know.
She's a drunk, she's insane,
she let the dogs shit
on the floor.
It's the last thing your father
ever would've wanted.
Suddenly you care
what he would've wanted?
Where to now?
The funeral parlor.
Great.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are we going?
It's in Beverly.
No.
There's no funeral
in Manchester?
homes
The cemetery's here.
Let's just get this done.
Dude, what is
with that guy and the big
Serious and Somber Act?
I don't know.
But seriously, does he not
realize that people know
he does this every single day?
I don't know.
Why can't we bury him?
It's too cold.
The ground is too hard.
They'll bury him in the Spring.
So what do they do
with him until then?
They put him in a freezer.
Are you serious?
Yes.
That really freaks me out.
It doesn't matter.
Wait a minute.
I think I parked
the car the other way.
Sorry.
What about one of those
mini-steam shovels?
What?
I once saw one of those
mini-steam shovels one time
in a graveyard
in New Haven.
It dug a perfect little hole
in about two seconds.
I don't really know how
you would get a hold of one.
Or how much
it would cost.
Why can't we just look
into it?
Because you can't use
heavy equipment in the historic
Rosedale Cemetery.
Why not?
Because there are
very important people
who are buried there,
and their descendants don't want
steam shovels vibrating over
their dead bodies.
Why can't we just bury him
someplace else?
Cause that's the plot
that Joe bought.
Don't ask me why,
but if you want make
some other arrangements,
you want to find
someplace else to bury him,
you want to talk
to the mortician,
and you want to call up
Sacred Heart and talk
to Father Martin
and then find out how much
that's going to cost and make
all those arrangements,
be my guest,
otherwise, let's just
leave it, okay?
I'm just saying
I don't like him being
in a freezer.
Yeah.
I don't like it, either,
but it isn't him
cause he's gone.
It's just his body.
I'm just saying
it kind of freaks me out.
Oh, goddammit,
where did I park the car?
Yeah, I don't know,
but I wish you'd figure it out
cause I'm freezing my ass off.
You don't have
a normal winter coat?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
Why don't you wear gloves
with real fingers on them?
Oh, God, fuck.
Oh, fuck, where'd I park
this motherfucking car?
Damn, it's cold.
Why?
What's the matter
with your winter jacket?
Seriously, Patty?
Just turn the heat on.
It's on already.
Turn it up a little.
It's all the way up.
It's blowing fucking
freezing air on me.
It takes a minute
to warm up.
What year did you get
this thing, 1928?
Where's the horse
that goes with this fucking car?
Maybe he can breathe on us.
I swear to God...
I know.
Why don't we keep my dad
in here for the next
three months?
You'd save
a fucking fortune.
Will you shut the fuck up
about the freezer?
You want me to have
a nervous breakdown
because there's undertakers
and a funeral?
Who cares?
No, I don't.
Okay, It's getting warmer.
I got band practice.
Can you drive me home so
I can get my stuff and take me
over to my girlfriend's house?
Sure.
Is this is the same girl
who was over at the house?
No, that was Silvie,
and this is Sandy.
And they don't know
about each other,
so, uh,
please don't say anything
in case it comes up.
I won't.
Do you actually have sex
with these girls?
Well, we don't just play
computer games.
With both of them?
Well, with Sandy's morn here,
it's sort of uh, strictly just like
basement business.
What does that mean?
It means
I'm working on it.
âª I got to run âª
âª I got to run âª
I got to âª
I got to âª
I got to run âª
Stop.
Joel, man,
what are you doing?
What did I do?
You're way behind, man.
No, I'm not.
You're a little behind.
You got to stay
with the bass.
Come on, man.
Just stay with me, all right?
Let's go.
All right. I'm sorry.
Yeah, come on.
Come on, let's go.
All right, guys,
let's go again.
Otto, are you good'?
Are you good, buddy?
We are Stentorian.
One, two, three.
âª I got to run âª
âª I got to run âª
Â£1272'? I j
Hi.
Are you Lee?
I'm Jill, Sandy's mom.
I think they're wrapping up.
Do you want to come inside
and have a beer or something?
No.
That's all right.
Thank you.
I wanted to offer
my condolences
about Joe.
He was a terrific guy.
There's not too many like him.
He was a wonderful father.
Thank you.
I was...
I was going to ask Patrick
if he wants to stay for supper,
if that's okay with you.
You want to join us?
I made way too much.
Oh.
Uh...
That's all right.
I'll just come back
and get him.
What time
should I come back?
Oh, I don't know.
Nine, nine thirty.
They're going to do
their homework together.
Supposedly.
Ha, ha, ha.
All right.
I'll come back at 9:30.
Okay.
Well, you change your mind
in the next ten minutes,
we're right inside.
Okay, thanks.
Jesus Christ.
How do you unbuckle this?
I'm scraping the skin
off my knuckles.
Just take your hand out.
Ow.
Would you please just take
your hand out of my cunt?
Okay, okay.
Oh, we're taking
our pants off?
I'm taking my pants off.
I don't know what you're doing.
I'm taking my pants off.
Come on.
You got to take
your shoe off first.
Jesus.
I'm trying.
Hey, kids?
Come on, have some dinner.
Thanks, mom.
We'll be right down.
Thanks, Jill
One second.
I just got to log off.
Would you shut up?
She's not retarded.
Why are you picking on me?
I'm not picking on you.
You'll get me in trouble.
I'm not going
to get in trouble.
What are you trying to do?
How's the math homework?
It's good.
Very frustrating.
Good.
Yeah, those algorithms
are a bitch.
This is really good, Jill.
Thank you, Patrick.
This is a homemade
Cabonara sauce?
Jesus.
Shut up.
No.
You could've fooled me.
Jesus.
What? What?
You're such a kiss ass.
Sandy.
Because I appreciate
your mother's cooking?
Good night.
Good night.
Aren't you going to ask
what happened?
I don't want to know.
I guess not.
Come on.
Begeron closes,
dinks and scores.
Alex Dean.
- Hello?
- Hello, Lee?
It's Randi.
Hello?
Yeah, sorry, I'm here.
Hi, how are you?
I'm okay.
How are you?
Good.
I was just calling...
George told me about' Joe.
I just wanted to call
and say I'm sorry.
I hope
you don't mind me calling.
No, it's fine.
Thank you, I don't mind.
How are you?
Not so good right now.
I guess we should've
seen it coming, but' it's still
hard to believe.
Yeah.
How's Patrick doing?
He's good.
Beyond the obvious, obviously.
He's okay, he's fine.
I mean, I don't know,
you know how kids are.
It's hard to tell.
He doesn't really
open up with me,
but he seems fine.
He's got a lot of friends, so.
Well, that's good.
Good, yeah.
$0, I don't know
if you planned a service, yet,
but I was also
going to ask you
if you wouldn't' mind,
I'd like to be there,
if it's okay with you.
Yeah, it's fine.
I don't mind.
Okay, thank you.
It would mean a lot to me.
You should come.
I'll let you know
when it's going to be.
Thank you.
So, can I ask...
How are you?
I don't know.
How are you?
I don't know.
We're doing pretty well.
I should probably tell you.
I'm going to be...
Actually, I'm pregnant.
Oh, yeah'?
Yeah.
You know,
like ready to pop.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I didn't know
if I should tell you, but...
No, it's fine.
Congratulations.
Thank you-
You would probably deduce it
for yourself when you see me.
Yeah.
So I, you know,
I just wanted to say,
you know...
Actually, um, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to cut you off.
I've just got to go...
I just wanted to make sure
it's okay if me and Josh
come to the funeral.
It's totally okay.
Thank you, Lee.
God bless.
Bye.
So long.
So, how you holding up?
What's the matter?
No.
I said how you holding up?
It's a stupid question.
You get some food?
Oh, I had some cheese.
You had some cheese?
Asshole.
I'll get you something.
I don't want anything.
Hey, Janine.
Sure?
Sure.
Never mind.
What?
Forget it.
Skip it.
I can't hear
a goddamn word you're saying.
What?
Did Lee get' food?
He didn't...
What?
Did Lee get food?
No.
He doesn't want any.
We're good.
Forget it.
He doesn't...
We're fine.
He doesn't want any.
Hey, is it okay
if I invite Silvie over?
Uh, which one is she?
She's the one
with the, uh, the brown hair.
No.
What do you mean, no?
I don't like her.
I don't want her
in the house right now.
Why not?
You don't even
have to talk to her.
Sorry.
Go to her house.
Call one of your friends.
That's it.
Would it be cool with your morn
if I came over there?
I have no idea.
Okay.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Well, I can't stay there, either.
Sorry about that.
You going to stay in here?
Yeah, why not?
I thought maybe you'd want
to stay in Dad's room.
Hm?
Why?
You want me to?
No, it's just a better room.
And he's not using it.
Okay.
I'll stay in there.
We're not going to be here
that much longer anyway.
I'm not moving
to Boston, Uncle Lee.
Well, I don't want to talk
about that right now.
You said he left you money
so you could move.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean...

So what?
You could do that anywhere.
There's plenty of toilets
and clogged-up drains
all over town.
I don't want to talk about it.
All my friends are here.
I'm on the hockey team.
I'm on the basketball team.
I got to maintain our boat now.
I work on George's boat
two days a week.
I got two girlfriends,
and I'm in a band.
You're a janitor in Quincy.
What the hell do you care
where you live?
I got to go to sleep.
Good night.
Where are you going
to stay tonight?
I don't know.
A motel.
What time
you going to call me?
When I get to the motel.
If I don't hear from you
by 9:00, I'm going to call
the cops.
You understand?
Yes, yes.
Patrick, come say goodbye
to your Uncle Lee.

Coming.
I'm going to see him.
Bye, Uncle Lee.
So long.
Patty?
I think there's something
wrong with me.
What do you mean, like what?
Are you sick?
I don't know.
I feel really weird.
I'm sick.
I'm having a panic attack.
What do you mean?
Hey.
I don't know.
Can you get that shit
out of here please?
Get rid of what?
I don't know.
I don't know.
The food?
I feel really weird.
You want me
to get rid of the food?
I don't know.
Patrick.
Hey, do you want me
to take you to the hospital?
I don't know.
Do you want me
to call your friends?
I don't know.
What do you want me to do?
I don't know.
Patty, are you going
to bed?
Leave me alone.
I don't think I should let you
keep the door shut'-
Just go away.
I will.
Just open up the door.
Fuck you.
Jesus Christ.
What's your problem?
I said open the door.
Are you having a breakdown?
Should we take you
to the hospital?
No, no.
I'm just freaking out.
Okay, fine.
But I can't let you freak out
with the door closed.
And if you're going to freak out
every time that you see
a frozen chicken,
I think we should go
to the hospital.
I don't know
anything about this.
I just don't like him
being in the freezer.
You've expressed that
very clearly.
I don't like it, either.
But there's nothing
we can do about it.
I'm not going to bother you.
I'm going to just sit here
until you calm down.
All right, I'm calmer now.
Would you please just go away?
No.
Cool.
How much
are they paying you?
Minimum wage
plus the room.
All right.
Let's go get
some furniture.
I got furniture.
No, you don't.
This doesn't count
as furniture.
This is not a room.
Let's go get
some furniture.
Get off my back.
Patty.
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.
There you go.
All right.
Better?
Better.
So listen.
You can stay here
until your school lets out.
That'll give me some time
to set things up
in Boston better.
Maybe you can do
some stuff for George
in the summer if you want.
And you don't get
jerked out of your life
overnight.
Okay?
Are you asking
me or telling me?
I'm telling you
that's the best I can do.
What do you care whether
it's okay with me or not?
It's 45 minutes away.
You can come back here
any time you want.
It's an hour and a...
Is that a joke?
It's an hour
and a half at least.
No, it's not.
An hour 15,
depending on traffic.
You couldn't get from here
to Quincy in half an hour if
you flew in a fucking spaceship.
Okay, fuck it.
I need lunch money.
Hey, Patrick.
Hey, Patrick.
Patrick.
So, are you going
to Godspell?
I'm thinking about it.
All right.
Goodbye.
Are those
your girlfriends, too?
They wish.
Doesn't George
give you money
for working on his boat?
Yeah, but I'm saving that.
For what?
New motor.
Are you going
to Godspell?
Oh, come on.
Oh, come on.
Hello?
Hello, Lee?
Lee?
Lee, is that you?
Hello?
What happened
to your hand?
I cut it.
Oh, for a minute there
I didn't know what happened.
Is there some reason
why you didn't tell me
my morn tried to call me?
She wrote me
you hung up on her.
She's in Essex.
She wants me
to come have lunch
and meet her fiance.
What did you think?
She couldn't get in touch
with me?
I hung up on her
because I didn't know
what to say to her.
And I didn't tell you
because I didn't know
what to say to you.
I'm sorry.
You can't stop me
talking to her.
I don't give a shit
what you do.
No, but you won't let
my girlfriend stay over.
You hate my mother so much
you won't even tell me
she called.
You'd rather drag me
to Quincy and ruin my life
and let somebody else
be my guardian.
There is nobody else.
I can live in Essex
with my Mom.
No, you can't.
She's not an alcoholic anymore.
She wants me to stay with her,
then that solves all our
problems.
I can take the same bus
to my same school and keep
all my friends and the boat,
and you can go back to Boston
and still check in on me or
whatever, if you want to.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Patty, I'm sorry
I hung up on her.
I'll call her back.
If she seems
semi-human to me,
you can go and have lunch
with her and her fiancÃ©.
That's it.
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.
Okay, soon as we clear,
open it up and we'll see
what we can do.
Okay.
Oh.
Lee?
What do you say?
How are you?
Yeah, good.
How are you?
All right.
Yeah.
I'm really sorry
to hear about Joe.
Yeah, thanks.
How's Patrick doing?
Good.
Yeah? Good.
What's going on?
You know, I'm back,
I'm thinking about staying
through the summer.
I was wondering
if you had any work-
I could pick up some hours.
Sure, sure.
Walter's down in Boston, so...
Oh, he is?
Yeah, he should be
back tomorrow if you want
to come by.
He's coming back up tomorrow?
Yeah, give him a call.
Well, I will
give him a call, yeah.
That's a good idea.
Absolutely.
Okay, all right.
Hey.
Yeah, all right.
Good to see you.
Thanks, Jerry.
I don't want to see him
in here again.
So long, Patrick.
How's the motor?
George says the piston's
going to go right through
the block any minute now.
Unfortunately,
that's a problem.
We can't afford to keep
the boat if we can't run it,
and we can't run it
if it's got a broken motor.
Let's take out a loan.
And pay it back with what?
We hire it out till we pay
the loan back, obviously.
Unfortunately for you,
I'm in charge of your finances
until you turn 21,
and I'm not comfortable
taking out enormous loans
on your behalf.
I have band practice.
Can you drive me home
to get my stuff,
and then drive me over
to Sandy's house?
Sure.
Why don't you take
a Drivers' Ed course?
Dad made me promise
not to drive till I was 17.
Okay, we'll stick
with that then.
Do you want
to stay for dinner?
I think Sandy's mother
likes you.
No, she doesn't.
I happen to know
that she does.
This could be good
for both of us.
I'd really rather not.
Well...
can you at least
just hang out with her
for half an hour
so I can be alone with Sandy
without her mother knocking
on the door every 20 seconds?
Come on, man.
All you got to do
is talk to her.
Why can't you help me out
a little bit for once
instead of dragging me
to the lawyers and the funeral
parlor and the morgue?
Anyway, she's really nice.
âª Tell me why âª
âª Why âª
âª Why âª
âª Why do you need me
Why do you wan! me âª
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.
Otto.
What?
I'm too slow?
Too fast, man.
You're dragging.
You're way
too fast, man.
I'm too fast.
Dude, you're like pulling out
of the fucking station ahead
of me.
Oh, my god, you guys.
Leave him alone.
I'm like, are you serious
about this band, or what?
Okay, all right.
Just lay off him.
Get off my back.
All right,
everybody just chill here.
Let's just, um,
let's just go again.
We are Stentorian.
Patrick is one
of my favorite people.
That's good.
How's it going
up there, you guys?
It's going fine.
We're right in the middle
of something.
We're just banging out
those compound fractions.
At least we know
where they are, right?
That's true.
How many of those do you
generally got to go through
before you pick a winner?
I'd like to see you use
one of these goddamn things
with all these interruptions.
Oh, fuck.
What happened?
Are you okay?
I tripped over
your fucking doll house.
Oh, my God,
did you break it?
I don't know.
I'm fine though,
by the way.
Oh, my God.
My grandmother gave me that
when I was five years old.
It was literally her doll house
from when she was a little girl.
What's it doing
on the fucking floor?
It's a doll house.
That's where you play with it.
Sandy, what' is
going on up there?
Nothing.
Patrick just stubbed his toe
on Mummer's doll house.
But it's okay.
That doll house
belonged to my mother.
If you're going
to smash it to pieces...
Nobody is
smashing it to pieces.
Don't worry Jill, I'm okay.
My toe's going to be okay.
Yes-
Do you want
to fuck me or not?
Could I get you
another beer, Lee?
I'm good.
Thank you.
Would you excuse me, Lee,
one sec?
Sure.
Is it on?
Yes.
It's a miracle.
Okay, hurry up.
One second please.
Get out of the way.
Um}
I'm sorry.
What's up?
I'm really sorry.
I know
you're trying to work,
but I can't sit down there
much longer.
Why?
What's the problem?
He won't talk.
I've been trying
to make conversation
for half an hour.
I realize I'm not the most
fascinating person in the world,
Oh, Mum.
But it's very, very strained.
What's going on?
She can't get
your uncle to talk.
He likes sports.
I'm sorry to bust things up,
but how much longer do you think
you're going to be?
Could you maybe
turn on a game?
I'm sorry.
Shut up
Mammy, please.
You were
a tremendous help.
I didn't ask
to sit down there.
You can't make
small talk?
Like every other
grown up in the world?
You can't talk about
boring bullshit for half
an hour?
Hey, how about
those interest rates?
No.
I lost my Triple A card.
Like everybody else?
No, sorry.
You're a fucking asshole.
Where did you say she lives?
Cause there are no houses there.
None.
What, does she live
in a fucking sleeping bag?
119 Pigeon Hill Street.
Pigeon Hill Street
or Pigeon Hill Road?
Pigeon Hill Street.
Pigeon Hill Street,
Pigeon Hill Court,
Pigeon Hill Road.
Street.
Pigeon Hill Street.
This is Pigeon Hill Road.
Okay.
You have no GPS whatsoever?
No, I've got a little fucking
cartoon movie.
You want me
to punch it in for you?
No, I don't, I've got.
Thank you.
Okay, listen.
Are you nervous?
Yeah, I'm nervous.
What, are you
a fucking genius?
Okay, skip it.
I just want you to text me
if anything gets weird.
Okay.
Thank you.
Oh, my gosh.
Is that my Patrick?
Hi, Mom.
Oh.
I'm so happy.
Come in.
Welcome to my home.
Patrick, this is my fella.
Jeffrey, this is Patrick.
Great to finally
meet you, Patrick.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.
And this is Lee.
Hey.
Welcome.
Jeffrey.
Lee.
Now, Lee, you sure
you can't stay for lunch?
Uh, I'm positive.
Thanks.
Come.
Uh, are you sure
I can't help with...
No, thanks, honey.
Your job is to relax.
That is your number one
assignment, okay?
Okay, all right.
I'm really going
to apply myself.
Oh, I was just joking.
I know you were.
So was I.
How we getting along?
Great.
Great.
You don't have to be
so polite, you know.
I'm not being polite.
Did you want to wash
your hands before we eat?
Yes.
For what we are about
to receive, let us give thanks.
Amen.
Amen.
You can say amen, Patrick.
Nobody's trying to recruit you.
I did say amen.
Oh, you did?
Okay.
You don't have to.
Yeah, I know.
I just said it really quietly.
Oh, it's fine.
Honey, look,
I know I'm going
to be a shock to you
in a lot of ways.
I'm hoping
it's a good shock.
Yeah.
You need
anything else, Patrick?
I hope everything's okay.
Oh, yeah,
everything's great.
You don't have
to be so formal.
I'm not.
I think your mother
wants you to feel that...
I'm just saying that
this is your home, too.
I want it to be.
And... I know,
I know, uh, things
are different for you and...
I don't know.
That's okay.
What are you studying
in school, Patrick?
Oh, well,
the usual stuff.
You know what?
I'm going to be right back
Does anybody need anything
from the kitchen?
No, thanks.
I'm good, no.
Did you get
some string beans?
Oh, no, not yet.
Thank you.
Uh, let me um...
Let me just see
what she's doing in there.
So, what was she like?
I don't know.
She was pretty nervous.
Yeah?
What was that guy like?
He was very Christian.
Uh, you know,
we're Christian, too, right?
Yes, I know that.
You are aware
that Catholics are Christians?
Yes, I'm aware of that.
Well, sounds like
she's doing better anyway.
She's not drinking.
She's not
in the psych ward.
Wow.
Wow what?
You'll do anything
to get rid of me.
What?
You heard me.
That's not true.
Dear Patrick, I'm writing
to thank you for today.
Your visit meant the world
to your mom.
We are both deeply grateful
for the love and trust that
you've shown
by offering to rejoin her life.
But I feel it would be
unfair to your mom
to rush her along the long
and challenging road ahead,
and so I'm going to ask you
to write to me in future
to arrange
any further visits.
I hope you won '2' take
this as an intrusion...
Where's your friends tonight?
I don't know.
Why don't you call
that girl Sandy,
and see if she'll come over?
No, thanks.
Nice try, though.
Who are you going to shoot?
You or me?
Do you know
what these things are worth?
No-
Want to try and sell them
so you can get a motor
for the boat?
That's a really good idea.
âª I never cared
much for moonlit skies âª
- This is awesome.
- It is awesome.
You want to drive?
Sure.
All right.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
Just straighten her out.
That's okay.
âª Or candlelight'

The lamp down low âª
âª I'm beginning
To see the light âª

In the dark âª
âª Then you came
And caused a spark âª
Hey, I got to run some chores.
I'll be back in a couple
of hours.
You want anything?
No, thank you.
No, thanks, Mr. Chandler.
Thank you.
âª I never made love
By lantern shine âª
Set up.
What are you
talking about?
H, yeah,
how's;
Who?
Just open the door.

âª I'm beginning
To see the light âª
âª I never cared much
For moonlit skies âª
âª I never wink back

Hi.
Hi.
Rachel, this is Lee.
Hello.
Lee, this is Rachel.
Hi.
And this is Dylan.
You can't see him too good.
Hi, Dylan.
Very handsome.
Randi, you want me
to get the car and pick you up?
Yeah.
Oh, that's okay.
Actually, I got to go.
Actually, could we, um,
could we talk
for a second?
Sure.
Okay.
I'll just pull around.
Just be a few minutes.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, you, too.
Be right back.
Um...
I don't have
anything big to say.
That's okay.
Just...
I know you been around,
and I thought...
Just been getting Patrick
settled in.
It seems like
he's doing pretty good.
Considering.
I think he is.
Yeah.
I guess
you don't know this, but I...
I really kept in touch
with Joe.
I knew that.
It's been kind of weird
for me not seeing Patrick...
Okay.
I didn't know.
You can see him
if you want.
Could we ever have lunch?
You mean us?
You and me?
Yeah.
Um...
Because I, uh...
I said a lot
of terrible things to you.
No.
But I... I know you never...
Maybe you don't want
to talk to me.
It's not that.
Let me finish.
However...
my heart was broken.
Cause it's always
going to be broken.
And I know yours
is broken, too.
But I don't have
to carry...
I said things that...
I should fucking burn in hell
for what I said to you.
No, no, no, no.
It was just...
Randi, no.
I'm just sorry.
I-I-I can't,
I can't...
Lee, I love you.
Maybe I shouldn't say that.
You can say that.
I just...
I'm sorry.
I've got to go.
We couldn't have lunch?
I'm really sorry.
I don't think so.
I thank you for saying
everything that you said.
You can't just die.
I'm not, I'm not,
and I'm not, and I'm...
Honey...
I want you to be happy.
Honey, I see you
walking around here...
and I just want
to tell you...
I would want to talk
to you, Randi...
But Lee...
Please, I-I-I...
Lee, Lee,
you got to...
I'm-I'm...
I don't know what...
I don't want to torture you.
You're not torturing me.
I just want to tell you
that I was wrong.
No, no.
You don't understand.
There's nothing there.
There's nothing there.
That's not true.
That's not true.
There's nothing there.
You don't understand.
I don't know what to say.
I can understand.
I know you understand.
I've got to go.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Sorry, buddy.
That's all right.
Look out, look out, look out.
Break it up, break it up.
Break it up.
Break it up.
Get off him.
Break it up.
Break it up.
Break it up.
Break it up.
Break it up.
Get him out
of here, George.
He's Joey Chandler's brother.
Back off, back off.
Break it up.
Settle down.
Settle down.
Fuckthat.
motherfucker.
Settle down.
Settle down, all right?
Are we cool?
Fuck you.
Fuck him.
Get off.
You'll fucking kill him.
Should he go
to the hospital?
I don't think so.
Nothing's broken.
What did they fucking
hit him with, a baseball bat?
They all just said
he started swinging.
Where's Patrick?
He's with the kids.
I sent them out for burgers.
No, no, no, no.
Lee, sit down.
Sit down,
it's all right.
Let me give you some money.
No, Lee, I got it.
I'll give you some money.
Put that away.
I got it.
No, I got it.
Put your money away.
101:59:59,346 --> 02:60:-3599,I got it.
It's on me.
Let me give you
some coffee.
Drink this.
Come on.
Come on, buddy.
Can I get you anything,
Uncle Lee?
Oh, no, thanks, buddy.
All right.
I'm going to go to bed.
Good night, kiddo.
Thomas.
Drives to the basket, gets two.
That's what you want.
Daddy?
Daddy?
Yes, honey.
Can't you see
we're burning?
No, honey.
You're not burning.
Uncle Lee,
what is that smell?
I just burnt the sauce.
Everything's okay.
Yeah.
I got a job in Boston.
Starts in July.
What is it?
Custodian.
Handy man.
But it's just two buildings
this time, so...
And what uh, delightful
Boston neighborhood have you
selected for us to live in?
None.
What do you mean?
You don't have
to move to Boston.
I'm going to be
in Charlestown.
And George
is going to take you.
What?
I talked to him
last week.
I explained
the situation to them.
Georgie Junior's going
to BU in the fall, and Jimmy
graduates next year.
We can rent this house out
until you turn 18,
and then you can come back
and stay if you want.
When you turn 21,
you're allowed to sell it
or keep it,
or whatever
you want to do.
We definitely have
to hire out the boat
when the summer's over.
Just like we talked about.
And when you get
your license, we can...
We can just figure that out
when it happens.
I'm still the trustee,
and all the financial stuff
that Joe set up for me
is going to get transferred
over to George.
Basically everything
is staying the same,
except you don't have to move.
And, but who's...
Are they going to be
my guardians, or...
They're going to adopt you.
Anyway, that's just how
I set it up.
You don't have to.
It's up to you.
So you're just going
to disappear?
No.
No.
I set it up this way
so you could stay here.
And they're really glad
to have you.
I know, I know.
I mean, they're great, but...
Why can't you stay?
Come on, Patty.
I can't beat it.
I can't beat it.
I'm sorry.
What do you think?
I think it'll be okay.
Are you one
of Stan Chandler's boys?
Yeah, I'm Lee.
I used to play chess
with your father a long
time ago.
He was a excellent
chess player.
That's him.
He's not still living, is he?
No.
One of the sons
passed away recently,
I heard.
Uh, yeah, my brother Joe.
Very personable man.
My father
passed away in 1959.
A young man.
He worked on a tuna boat.
He get up one morning,
some weather,
nothing dramatic,
and he never returned.
No signals, no maydays.
No one ever found out
what happened to him.
I'm going to get
some ice cream.
Go ahead.
Can I have some money?
Yes.
So, when am I supposed
to move in with Georgie?
July.
I don't even have
a place to live, yet.
They don't give you
an apartment?
Yeah, but I'm looking for one
with an extra room.
Or room
for a pull-out sofa.
What for?
So you can come
visit sometime.
Or if you're going to look
at colleges in Boston,
you can stay overnight.
I'm not going to college.
Well, I'll have an extra room
for all my shit.
Do we have to talk
about this now?
No.
Great throw.
Just let it go.
Heads up.
$&$Maurice$&$
Thank you.
Hall, come here please.
Sir?
Come on.
Have a good send off?
Yes sir, thank you sir.
Mr. Abrahams gave me a picture,
the light of the world.
The fellas have given
me a set of Guatemalas.
Up to two dollars!
The ones with the parrot
and the pillar on.
Look, sir.
Oh, splendid, splendid.
And um, what did Mr. Abrahams
say to you?
Told you you were a
miserable sinner, I hope.
Mr. Abrahams said
I'm never to do anything
I'd be ashamed to do
in front of my mother.
He said my next school will
be more like the world.
Did he, did he?
What's the world like,
do you suppose?
Don't know, sir, I'm a boy.
Do you, um, have any
older brothers, Hall?
No, sir, only Kitty and Ada.
They're my sisters, sir.
No uncles?
No, sir.
There's Dr. Barry.
He knew my father
before he died.
So you don't really know a
great many grown-up fellows.
No, not really, sir.
Mother keeps a coachman,
and George for the garden.
But of course, you mean gentlemen.
Hall, I'm going to talk
to you for a few moments
as if I were your father.
It isn't anything
your mother could say.
Do you, do you see?
Your body, is about to experience
various changes, physical changes.
Now, Mr. Abrahams has explained
to you that in the beginning,
"God created he man and woman,
"that the earth should
be peopled abundantly."
Yes sir, Sir...
what changes?
I speak, Hall, of the
sacred mystery of sex,
the act of procreation
between a man and his wife.
The procreation indeed
of all creeping things.
You will discover that
your membrum virilis,
that's Latin from vir.
Vir, sir, it means man, sir.
Very good, very good.
Um, uh, look.
Uh, this might be easier if I...
That, that, that, um, that thing.
There, now, that will...
develop and grow larger.
You see?
And when that happens, the man lies
very, very close to his wife,
and he puts his membrum
virilis into her vagina...
thus.
Then, in due course, she
will bring forth his child.
Seminiferous tubules,
labia major and minor, ducts...
vulva.
That, that is the very
crown of life, Hall.
God's wondrous purpose.
Your body is his temple.
You must never, ever
pollute that temple.
And when,
as one day I'm sure you will,
you fall in love and
marry, you will discover
to serve and protect a woman,
and have children by her,
is life's chiefest glory.
Yes, sir.
You must never,
ever mention any of this
to your mother,
or, or, or indeed to any lady.
And if at your next school
the fellows mention it,
just shut them up.
Tell them you know.
I think I shan't marry.
What?
Look, um, in 10 years to the day,
I invite you and your wife to dine
with me and my wife as our guests.
What do you say?
Oh, sir.
Yes, it's
a bargain then, is it?
Oh, God, those infernal designs.
Sir, won't they be all right?
The tide will have
covered them by now.
Oh,
yes, the rising tide.
I only hope to God he's right, by God.
Come, Victoria, come.
Wagner's utter rubbish.
Fat women with horns on their heads,
singing at the tops of their voices
about how happy they are to be dying.
It's a horrible noise,
and it's unhealthy.
But music is
about death, it always has been.
I think
he's trying to provoke us.
Go on then, Risley, enlighten us.
A superior mind wouldn't
need enlightening.
Music is the highest of the arts.
It needs no reference to the
figurative, or the corporeal.
It is therefore, of all the arts,
the closest to death.
Wagner's by no means unhealthy.
He's merely expressing
most exactly the state of things.
Help
yourselves to potatoes, Hall.
Don't stand on ceremony.
I can't stand music.
Or concert halls.
I don't go in for being superior.
Don't you?
I do.
Come along, Chapman,
you're in need of food.
I expect Lord Risley isn't.
I've put him off with my low talk.
I simply can't think
of a reply to that.
What about saying nothing?
Say nothing?
Horrible, he must be mad.
What you do is more
important than what you say.
Your deeds are more important
than your words.
What is the difference?
Words are deeds.
Are you trying to say
that these few minutes
talking in the dean's rooms
have done nothing for you?
Will you, for instance,
ever forget that you've met me?
You're confusing what is important
with what is impressive.
Chapman and Hall will always remember
they've met you,
of that I have no doubt.
Exactly, because of my conversation.
Oh, they'll forget that
they were engaged
in the act of eating a cutlet.
At least the cutlet
does some good to them.
You do not.
I mean, Dean, that a cutlet
merely influences
their subconscious life.
I, by my words,
shape the consciousness.
I am therefore not only
more impressive than the cutlet,
but infinitely more important.
Your dean here dwells
in superstitious clouds
of Christian self-righteousness.
Your dean pretends that
only insensate faith
is of any significance.
And daily he droops,
soporific, into his soup.
Oh, Risley, shut up.
Come on.
I think if a man
has ideas like that,
he should have the courtesy
to keep them to himself.
No, no, no, on the contrary,
one must talk, talk, talk.
It's only by talking that we
shall caper upon the summit.
Otherwise the mountains
will overshadow us.
I'm sure, Hall, you will agree.
Wait.
I'm eager to hear
more of your interesting ideas
about words and deeds.
My rooms are in Trinity.
And I have a dining club
whose members would,
if I'm not mistaken, interest you.
No need to bring your chum.
Oh, well.
You're not going, are you?
Salutations, Risley.
You've bargained for
more than you've gained.
Risley.
You've, uh, you've bargained
for more than you've gained.
Salutations.
Look.
Come in.
Hello?
You're Durham, aren't you?
Yes.
I was looking for Risley,
don't know where he is.
He's debating at the Union.
I was just stealing
his pathetic symphony.
I'm reading a paper on Tchaikovsky,
but I cannot find the third movement.
If it's here at all,
which I don't think it is.
Featherstonhaugh's got a Pianola.
I know.
His rooms are directly above mine.
Oh, well, I'll come back
with you then.
You're living in college now?
Beginning my second year.
I'm third.
I have seen you, though.
Hall, isn't it?
If Risley's not coming,
perhaps I'd better get back.
I didn't know you knew Risley.
He's a dangerous man.
A little of him certainly
goes a very long way.
You like this music?
I'm afraid I do, yes.
Sweet water from a foul well,
as they say.
A good waltz is more my style.
Hmm, mine too, really.
Thank you, good night.
Good night, sir.
Hall.
Oh, got your third movement.
I thought I'd come
along with you instead.
Here, give me some of those
to carry.
It's all right, I think
I've got them safe now.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
Give.
Mortarboard.
This bit's supposed to be mad.
Hall.
You, you should be at this end.
You should get as far away
from the machine as you can.
Play it again.
If Featherstonhaugh
doesn't mind, that is.
No, you can't play it again.
It's a, it's a movement.
You have to get right to the end.
Featherstonhaugh, I think I'm
gonna eat one of your apples.
Is this Sophocles?
Mm.
Try reading it for the
characters, rather than the author.
It's much more interesting.
Much too fast, Hall.
Slower, slower.
There, otherwise you'll tear it.
This bit isn't as jolly,
really, is it?
No, it's not.
Appalling vac.
I nearly wrote to you about it.
My mother started flinging
the cat about
because I wouldn't go to
Communion on Christmas Day.
I mean, I'm unorthodox.
I'm not a Christian.
It was imperative that I made a stand.
It's a difficult question.
Hall, come down to the buttery.
Oh, hello, Durham.
Halliday's been given a
case of hock for Christmas.
Reward for good behavior over the vac.
He's asked for us.
I'm sorry, Chapman, not now.
We're fixing something.
Oh, I see.
Sorry, well, perhaps
we'll see you later, then.
Have you known Chapman long?
Five years,
here and at school.
Give me a cigarette, would you?
I mean, you've got a mother
and sisters.
All the way through that row
I was thinking what you
would have done.
My mother never
makes a row about anything.
That's 'cause you've never
done anything
she wouldn't approve, I expect.
You never will.
I'm disgusted with mine.
I despise her character.
There, I've told you something
no one else in the world knows.
Won't tell.
Tell me about your home life.
Nothing to say.
We just go on.
Lucky devils.
Rotten vac, eh?
Yes, it was, rotten.
Misery and hell.
Ow, that really hurt, ow!
Misery and hell, eh?
Hall, what are you,
No, no, Hall, no.
Please, I've got to go.
Don't be such a fool.
I've got to go,
I said I've got a lecture.
Why don't you go late again?
Because I can't.
You think I don't think.
But I can tell you I do.
"Every human soul has
"at some stage beheld
an excellent being.
"Otherwise, it would not have
"entered into the creature
"we call man.
"When the soul
"gazes upon the beauty
"of that being, its beloved
"it nu, is nurtured
"and warmed, and is glad."
Featherstonhaugh, continue, please.
"When the beloved
has made him welcome
"and begun to enjoy
his conversation and--"
"Society."
"Society."
"When their intimacy is
"established
"and the loved one
"has grown used
"to being near his friend,
"and touching him in
"the gymnasium and elsewhere,
"the current which Zeus
in love with Ganymede
"called 'the stream of longing."'
Omit the reference to the
unspeakable vice of the Greeks.
Ah, yes, sir.
"He, he is experiencing a counterlove,
"a reflection of the love he inspires,
"and he thinks of it as
friendship, not love.
"Though, like his lover,
"he feels a desire to see,
to touch, to kiss him."
"The unspeakable
vice of the Greeks"?
The hypocrisy of the man.
He ought to lose his fellowship.
Oh, come on!
No, as a point of pure scholarship.
All the poor old dean can understand
is the physical act.
I'm not advocating that.
Cold as a fish on a marble
slab, you see?
Shut up, Risley.
I'm trying to make
a serious point here,
which is that a masculine love
of physical beauty
and of moral beauty,
and of the beauty of the
thirst for human knowledge,
you omit that and you've omitted
the mainstay of Athenian society.
It's as if our benighted dean
hadn't even read The Symposium.
You read it, Hall?
No, no, you missed the point.
You have to maintain some
standards of decency.
No, you don't.
Not if they're propped
up by tenth-hand opinion.
Typical of you, I may say.
Western civilization happens
to be run on the principles
of Christ's doctrines, not
Plato's bloody essences.
What exactly do you mean
by Christ's doctrines?
They're open to all
sorts of interpretations.
You know, the redemption,
the Trinity.
âª Three in one
âª And one in three
âª Ruler of the earth and sea
âª Hear us while âª
Damn Christ's doctrines.
I can't prove them,
but they mean a lot
to millions of people,
whatever you say.
âª Holy Child and Son âª
âª Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord âª
Hall.
âª And my mouth shall show thy praise
âª For thou desirest no sacrifice
âª Else would I
âª Give it thee
âª But thou delightest not
âª In burnt offerings âª
That was enormously embarrassing.
I did actually say at 6:00.
You just made me walk out of chapel.
I just don't understand it.
Your father always went to church.
I can't help it, Mother.
I'm made that way.
There's no use arguing.
Durham.
I wonder if that's
Alicia Durham's brother.
Besides, I'm not my father.
Morrie.
What a thing to say.
Well, he isn't.
Really, Mother, come on.
Kitty, we are talking
about things not suited,
and you are perfectly wrong
Besides, Morrie is the
image of his father.
Dr. Barry said so.
Dr. Barry doesn't go
to church himself.
Dr. Barry is a most clever man,
and so is Mrs. Barry.
Imagine Mrs. Barry being a man.
Have you been all right?
Have you?
No.
You wrote that you were.
Hall!
Here.
We want tea, we need tea!
We demand tea!
Hello, Durham.
A glorious
match, we're absolute heroes.
Peterhouse are abject.
And wonderful wicket-keeping.
Don't you have any Darjeeling, Hall?
I don't like this Chinese bilge.
A marvelous match.
Best so far.
If it hadn't been for my two valiant
catches in the slips--
Three wickets.
Just dropping them
into the rough spot.
It was too easy.
Hall, Hall.
Durham, where did you get to?
I know you read those books
in the vac.
How do you mean?
You'll understand then,
I don't have to explain.
Understand what?
That I love you.
Don't talk rubbish.
Durham?
Durham, come back!
Come on, old man.
Amen.
Clive, you're bloody hard.
You don't know what it is
to have a mind in a mess.
It makes you very hard.
Hall, don't be so stupid.
You must know that to be
alone with you hurts me.
I only want to discuss--
No, please don't reopen it.
It's over.
I'm in hell.
Oh, get out.
It's only disgust.
You haven't done anything
to be ashamed of.
You don't know
what hell's really like.
I thought it was the
worst crime in the calendar.
The one subject absolutely
beyond the limit.
Look, you've been thoroughly
decent from first to last.
So decent that I mistook
your friendliness.
I thought it was, something else.
I'm sorry to have insulted you.
Durham, I love you,
in my very own way.
Rubbish, as you so rightly said.
Good night.
I do.
I think I have always.
Look.
It's like the good,
blundering creature
that you are to try to comfort
me, but there are limits.
I'm thankful that it was
into your hands I fell.
Most men would have
reported me to the dean,
or the police.
Damn you, Durham.
Maurice.
I love you.
I love you.
Hall.
It's the dean.
Don't you have a lecture?
I overslept!
Hall! Stop when I
speak to you!
Do you realize,
I,
I would have gone
through life half-awake
if you'd had the decency
to leave me alone?
Why me?
Perhaps we woke up each other.
No.
Can't you kiss me?
I think, I think it would bring us,
I think it would bring us down.
I think it would spoil everything.
This harmony.
Body,
mind, soul.
I don't think women have even guessed.
But you know.
Why did you not stop
when I called you?
Yesterday you cut chapel,
four lectures,
including my own translation class.
And, Hall, you've done
this sort of thing before.
It's unnecessary to add
impertinence, don't you think?
Very well.
I'm sending you down.
You will catch the 12 o'clock.
Unless you write me
a letter of apology,
I shall not recommend your readmission
to college in October.
If it had been a girl
in the sidecar,
Cornwallis would never
have kicked up a stink.
Everyone cuts lectures.
I've done nothing wrong.
I refuse to say that I have.
What'll you do?
Go into the stock
market like Father did.
I don't need one of their
rotten degrees.
You will come to Pendersleigh?
Bye!
Boo-hoo-hoo.
Not quite
what you expected, eh?
Dr. Barry, not quite as
anyone expected.
Still, these past few weeks,
it's become apparent to me that
it's time a man was here to
head this household again.
Well, it's all for the best.
What do you want with a degree?
They were never meant
for the suburban classes.
I mean, you're not
going to become a parson
or a barrister or a
pedagogue, and you're not a,
you're not a country gentleman.
No, it's a sheer waste of time.
The city's your place.
Absolutely right to insult the dean.
If anything,
I've been insulted by him.
Treated like a schoolboy.
You see, your mother doesn't
understand how you feel.
She's worried because
you don't apologize.
To my mind, these things
work themselves out.
You see, you've got
yourself into an atmosphere
for which you were not suited,
and you very properly took
the first chance to get out.
How do you mean?
Oh, still not clear?
I mean that a gentleman would
have apologized by instinct
if he'd found that he'd
behaved as you did.
I think it's time I turned in.
How dare you bully
your mother, Maurice.
You ought to be horsewhipped.
Swaggering about instead of
begging her to forgive you.
She comes to me with tears in her eyes
and asks me to say something.
But--
Don't answer me, sir,
don't answer me.
I want none of your speech.
You're a disgrace to chivalry.
Oh!
I'm disappointed
and disgusted with you.
Oh, Morrie darling,
we all looked forward
so much to May Week.
Mother, do stop crying.
It'll only make him
think he's important.
He'll write to the dean as
soon as no one wants him to.
Kitty, I won't.
I don't see why you shouldn't.
Little girls don't see a great deal.
I see a great deal
more than some little boys
who think they're little men.
Mrs. Sheepshanks.
Oh, how very complimentary.
Thank you so much.
Skeggs, Olivia.
Woolly, dear.
I think everyone
should curtsy, don't you?
I've had such an interesting
talk with Mr. Hall.
And isn't Clive handsome?
Mother, this is Maurice Hall.
Welcome to Pendersleigh, Mr. Hall.
How do you do?
Woolly.
Yes, it's so lovely
to see you.
No, leave those, come on.
Oh, by the way,
if my mother or my sister ask you
to do this or that tomorrow,
don't worry.
Say yes if you want,
but you're actually
going to ride with me,
and they know it.
It's just their ritual.
But I haven't brought
any riding breeches.
Ah, well, I can't associate
with you in that case.
Deep breath.
You must be Mr. Hall.
I'm Pippa Durham, Clive's sister.
Yes, he's--
May I introduce Mr. London?
Mr. Hall.
How do you do?
Archie London.
How do you do?
I'm the lucky devil
who's to marry her.
I'm commandeering troops
for canvassing tomorrow,
tariff reform.
Yes,
stop bullying, Pippa.
Are you interested?
Certainly, I'd be delighted.
Good, there, Mama.
Mr. Hall is sound.
Pippa, dear, does
Mr. Hall know his room?
The Blue Room, Mama.
The Blue Room?
Poor man.
The one with the smoking fireplace.
Simcox.
Where'd you come from?
The old schoolroom, our study.
That's why you've been put to stay
in this dog's misery.
Come.
It's as much like college
as I could make it.
Look at the view, though.
There, you may shoot rabbits
from this window.
Oh, it is jolly for me, coming here.
Well, this place will
never seem the same again.
I shall love it at last.
Would there be anything else, sir?
No, thank you, Milly.
No, that's all.
We're up the staircase by ourselves.
We need never be in any
other part of the house,
apart from meals, that is.
I'll leave you to unpack.
See you down there.
I hope you can find enough
to amuse yourself, Mr. Hall.
So we dressed and came down
to find water lapping at
the foot of the staircase
and all the waiters wearing
green leather waders.
Yes, it was.
This house is his.
Did he tell you?
No, he didn't.
Oh, it is.
Under my late husband's will.
I must move to the dower
house as soon as he marries.
A fourth year at Cambridge
would little profit
a yokel like Clive.
He must take his place
here in the countryside.
There's the game to consider.
There are the tenants.
There'll be his duties
as a magistrate.
And unless there's a war,
there's his political future.
He ought to spend the
year traveling instead.
He must see America and,
if possible, the colonies.
He speaks of traveling.
He wants me to go with him.
I trust you
will, but not Greece, Mr. Hall.
That is traveling for pleasure.
Dissuade him from Greece.
I'd prefer America myself.
Naturally, anyone sensible would.
Pippa says he writes verse.
Have you seen any?
Mr. Hall, is there someone?
Some, Newnham girl?
Pippa declares there is.
Pippa had better ask, then.
Did I hear my name, Mr. Hall?
Hyah.
Damn, damn, it's locked.
The Goblin House.
My grandfather's grandfather built it.
I locked Pippa in here
for a whole day once
when we were small.
Ashby's
Ordinaries are up an eighth.
Three and seven-eighths,
four and three-eighths.
What's
Barclay Perkins doing?
Hmm, debit one, 87.90.
Gas staged a recovery.
What about Alliance and Dublin?
Alliance and Dublin?
Consumers' orders?
That'll do.
Up two.
Perhaps, dear Mrs. Hall,
when Clive has finally
completed, and, pray heaven,
passed his bar examinations,
would Ada not like to come down
and stay with us here at Pendersleigh?
I do declare that our sons
find amusement
in the friendship of our two families.
But Ada is such an attractive
and good-natured girl.
Although at present
Clive appears to regard
his Fridays to Mondays
entirely sacrosanct,
I'm sure that he, too,
could be enticed down.
I'm writing to Mrs. Hall.
I thought Ada might like to stay.
Ada?
Isn't that the girl whose grandfather
is going to leave her a lot of money?
She'll make an excellent
bride for my godson.
Really, perhaps Clive
doesn't want to marry yet.
Oh, would you be so good
as to post this, uh...
What's your name?
Scudder, ma'am.
We are already snug
in our little house, Mrs. Durham,
now that Maurice is living
at home after so long away.
Each day, he eats a vast breakfast
and then catches the 8:36.
He returns at 4:59,
and lays down the law.
He has developed, under
your son's influence,
into far more of a personage
than we had expected.
One hardly begrudges him the time
he spends as Clive's guest in London.
Is Clive not fortunate to
have a London house now
as well as beautiful
Pendersleigh Park?
I do confess that I am looking forward
to meeting their amusing London set,
pictures of some of whom we see
in the illustrated newspapers
here at dull Alfriston Gardens.
But I concentrated
on the tips of his mustache.
Do you think I might have
one of your cigarettes?
Do you not think
that Maurice's mustache
will be the making of him?
No, it's revolting.
Thank you, Clive.
Your cavalrymen, see,
must have legs so straight
that they can hold a sixpence between
their legs all the way up,
ankles, calves, knees, thighs.
Not only a sixpence,
is it, love?
Ends have to meet.
For the price of your beer,
no wonder.
He'll never do it.
Give the man his due.
One here.
âª I was a pure country lad âª
One here.
âª Till I took the queen's shilling âª
One here.
âª Now it seems I've turned out bad âª
The last sixpence there.
Oh, he's always winning.
Poor twink.
Well, I suppose it's pints
all around, gentlemen.
Get him!
Come on!
Come here, you.
Come along.
Would you give me my hat?
I'm told that if I plead guilty,
the publicity can be kept
to a minimum.
So what am I to do?
You must understand,
if I were to give you a testimonial,
it would make me a sitting
duck to any prosecution.
Yes, I see that.
I realize it might
compromise your position
to be seen to be associated with me.
Quite understand that.
Good night, Clive.
Good night.
Maurice.
Oh, where on earth have you been?
Excuse me.
Thanks.
Where have you been?
You all right?
Clive?
Yes, thank you, Maurice, I'm fine.
Please, don't nanny me.
The defendant is a man of breeding
who, rather than setting an example,
has regrettably attempted
the corruption of his social inferior.
He is a man of considerable learning
who has taken advantage
of the gullibility
and the baser passions of
his intellectual inferior.
Lord Risley, your guilt
has been unquestionably
proven before this court.
As you are no doubt aware,
I am empowered to sentence you
to imprisonment with flogging.
However, in view of the
promising career in politics,
which has been terminated
by your disgrace,
and in view of the position
in society which you have forfeited,
I am inclined to leniency,
in sentencing you
to six months imprisonment
with hard labor.
Silence!
I am satisfied that you
will pay for this
for the rest of your life.
Take him down.
All rise.
A wit, a poet.
Breeding.
Breeding, and now, legal legislator.
Legal legislator.
Clive Durham, barrister-at-art.
To Clive
Durham, our honored friend.
Barrister-at-law.
Mr. Durham.
To the
most marvelous evening.
Come on,
Clive, on your feet, Clive!
To the Durhams
of Pendersleigh Park.
Oh, I say, I'm gonna faint.
Mr. Durham!
Morrie, quickly.
Clive.
Get a pillow.
Kitty, a pillow.
Ada, brandy.
Mother.
What is it?
Fan him.
Oh, Morrie, what is it?
Oh, fan, fan, fan, fan him.
It's all right, silly to...
Oh.
Uh, all right, I'm all right.
Certainly not, Maurice
is going to carry you.
Oh, oh, dear.
Um, Mr. Durham.
Mr. Durham, try and put
your arms around Morrie.
Come along, old man, up you come.
That's it.
That's it, Morrie.
Come on.
Put your arm around me.
Sorry.
The doctor, somebody telephone.
Sorry, Morrie.
I'm a fool.
Oh, do be careful, Morrie.
It's rather hot.
Mother, you needn't tell
the others I kissed Durham.
He wouldn't like it.
No, of course not.
I was upset and, and
did it without thinking.
As you know, we're great friends.
Relations almost.
Mother, the doctor's here.
Where shall I put
the hot-water bottle?
You mustn't do this sort of thing.
You mustn't, it's filthy.
It doesn't worry me.
I don't say this just to please you.
You can carry on all night
as far as I'm concerned.
Although the doctor's coming up.
He'll see me like this.
I hope he does.
Oh, hello, Jowitt.
Sorry to call you out so late.
I'm just curious, chap.
He, uh, he fainted at dinner,
and he can't stop crying.
Been working hard?
Yes, and now he
says he's going to Greece.
So he shall.
You clear out now.
Told your sisters none of you
were to come into this room.
My sisters, yes,
I'm looking after him.
You equally.
Miss Kitty has telephoned to
the institute for a nurse.
Why is everything done
in such a damned hurry?
I thought a nurse might amuse him.
Can't we amuse him?
I can nurse him myself.
Oh, have you wheeling the baby next.
Beg your pardon?
I suppose I ought to have the nurse.
Right.
She can make you more
comfortable than I can.
Pendersleigh today?
Yes.
Mother, he can hardly stand up.
What does Jowitt say?
He seems to think
he's well enough to leave.
Keep him there.
I'll get the 1:40.
Someone will have to
talk sense to you people.
Good-bye.
What?
Shall I send the car?
No, I'll get a cab from the station.
How much do I owe?
Fourpence, governor.
Thank you.
Thank you very, very
much for being so kind.
Well, I hope you get better soon.
We've enjoyed having him
here, haven't we, Mother?
What are you playing at, Clive?
You're far too ill to travel.
I can't go on being such a
bore to your family, Maurice.
Don't be absurd.
Such good friends.
As he says, relations almost.
Mother, Mother, get in.
Good-bye, Mrs. Durham.
Thank you so much.
Good-bye, Mrs. Durham.
Don't let your coachman bump about.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye, and
don't forget his embrocation.
And fuller's earth, remember.
I'll tell cook.
Terrible affair about
Viscount Risley, sir.
And him a parliamentary
private secretary, too.
I did read he was at Cambridge.
Like yourself, sir.
You will never mention
that subject again, Simcox,
while you remain in employment here.
I've become a barrister so
that I may enter public life.
But why should I enter public life?
Who wants me?
Your mother says the country does.
Well I've talked to more
people than my mother,
and I tell you no one wants us,
or anything really,
except a comfortable home.
But to give people
a comfortable home
is what public life is for.
Is or ought to be?
Well, it's all the same.
Well, "is" and "ought"
are not the same.
Quite right, Mrs. Hall.
You sound as if you have no use
whatsoever for Greece, Mr. Hall.
It sounds out of repair.
A heap of old stones
without any paint on.
We shall know what it is
if you fall over this time,
Mr. Durham.
Your health, and the
health of all the ladies.
Maurice, come.
The ladies.
Oh, the ladies.
The ladies.
Dear Clive,
still no word from you,
so here is my news.
I am practicing a regimen
of severe self-discipline.
Our Wednesdays and our weekends
I spend in the darkest
reaches of Bermondsey
with the dockers lads at the mission.
It's a far cry from our
metropolitan pleasures.
I am supposed to be teaching
them the gentle art of boxing.
More often than not,
I get the pummeling.
Preferable to the pummeling
you gave me
at the Wigmore Hall, ha, ha.
Most of the other evenings
I spend working
through that reading
list you once gave me.
Clive, I'm so worried
at not hearing from you.
I get no sleep worrying
for fear that you've fallen ill again.
I've looked out your connections
and would expect you back
by Tuesday week.
Wire, if you can, on reaching Dover.
I don't have to tell
you how much I miss you.
Mr. Durham.
Oh, Maurice is away tonight
on business.
Oh, no, where's he gone?
Don't ask me.
We know even less about him than when
you were last here, if
you think that's possible.
He keeps everything so secret.
Mother, Ada,
Mr. Durham is back from Greece.
What was Greece like?
Um, rather disappointing,
I'm afraid.
It's not exactly what
I'd expected it would be.
Why didn't you let us know?
There'll be nothing but pie.
We would've given you
a real English dinner.
Don't worry, I can't
stay to dinner anyway--
No, Mr. Durham,
you must stop the night.
We've missed you,
haven't we, Ada, Kitty?
Maurice told us
you'd be back last week.
He was so disappointed.
We can practice on you.
We've joined an ambulance class.
We need a victim to bandage up.
It was Dr. Barry's idea.
He says there's going
to be a war soon.
You sound just like Maurice.
Your voices are wonderfully alike.
It's 'cause I have a cold.
No, you are alike, you
do have the same voice.
And nose, and by that, of course,
I mean the mouth, too.
And also his good spirits
and good health.
Kitty, on the other hand,
has his brains.
Ow, that really hurts!
Ow, ow.
Yeah, well, it's my hair.
That's very good, Kitty.
Thank you.
These are excellent,
I feel so much better.
If you knew what it was
to be in England.
Is Greece not nice?
Horrible.
Maurice said you'd like Greece.
Maurice doesn't know.
I'm happy you're back.
Maurice is home.
Clive.
Come out of all that, Clive.
Why did you let them?
I say he looks well.
You look well.
Come and have a drink.
I'll unpick you.
No, girls, not you.
Why didn't you answer my letters?
Don't you love me anymore?
All that must be tomorrow.
Quite so.
Have a drink.
Maurice, I don't want a row.
I do, I want a row,
and I'll have it.
Why didn't you write?
What secrets are you keeping from me?
I was trying to work things out,
and I couldn't explain in a letter.
One oughtn't to have
secrets, or they get worse.
One ought to talk.
No, thank you.
Talk, talk, talk.
Provided one has someone to talk to.
As you and I have.
I've thought about this solidly
for the last month and a half.
We've got to change, you and I.
Can the leopard change his spots?
Clive, you're in a muddle.
What is it you're afraid to tell me?
Surely we've got past
sparing each other.
You can't trust anyone else.
You and I are outlaws.
All this will be taken away
from us if people knew.
Precisely.
By continuing like this,
you and I are risking
everything we have.
Our careers, our,
our families, our names.
Balls!
I don't give a damn about name.
What sort of a life
would I have without you?
I risk everything, and gladly,
because the one thing
I dread losing is you.
You're the only happiness
there is for me.
There are other ways
to be happy, you know.
We could explore those a little.
Not for me.
Maurice, think how
easy life is for people
who don't have to go through all this.
This secrecy.
Never being able to talk
about the person
whom you're in love with to anybody.
Imagining the servants
are thinking things.
And always being asked
when you're gonna
get married, and having
every bloody girl
paraded in front of you
'cause your family's so desperate.
You want to
get married, is that it?
You're in love with some girl?
Who is it?
No one.
But don't you think
it would be wonderful
if there, if there was someone
who I could care about in the same way
that I do about you?
We love each other, and know it.
For God's sake, Maurice,
hold your tongue for a moment.
If I were in love with anyone now,
then it would be with some nice girl.
Like Ada.
Ada?
I take her
at random as an example.
You scarcely know Ada.
Don't be so stupid.
Try to understand.
We must change.
I like you enormously.
More, more than any man I've ever met.
Did you say something to
Ada just before I came in?
Didn't you hear my car come up?
Why did Kitty and my mother
come out and,
and not you and Ada?
Look, I really can't be
cross-examined about your sister.
Why not?
You must shut up and
concentrate, Maurice.
Ada.
What for?
Ada.
Maurice, no,
it mustn't end in a row.
Ada, Ada.
No, you can't drag in
a woman, I won't have it.
Give me the key!
Leave it!
Maurice, don't make it worse.
I didn't mean to.
Did I hurt you?
I'm all right.
What an ending.
What an ending!
Maurice?
What's gonna happen to me?
I'm done for.
Maurice?
Clive, what's the matter?
Ada.
Nothing, it's fine.
What's happened to your lip?
It's perfectly all right.
Just fooling about.
Maurice?
Don't be an ass.
Yes, he's, he's fine.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Yes, there is, I can see it.
You can't take me in.
No, really, Maurice.
It's, it's nothing.
Why,
what did he say?
Nothing.
Who said nothing?
Clive, he said nothing.
Clive, is it?
What is Mr. Durham to you?
Answer.
Do you want to know what
he told me just now,
when I accused him
of making love to you
behind all our backs?
What?
When I hit him?
No, Maurice.
He said that you, he said
you threw yourself at him.
No.
That you, you tried to corrupt him.
He complained that you,
you made advances to him.
And that, that's why he wouldn't stay.
That's why he's gone back to town.
You, you have the satisfaction of
breaking up our friendship at least.
You've always been unkind to us.
Always.
It's, it's not my fault.
It isn't.
Stop, remember, step back.
That's it.
That's good of you, sir.
There ain't many city gents
that'd give up their Saturdays.
Good night, sir.
Oh, good night, Mr. Hall, sir.
Children, Clive Durham
is engaged to be married.
How friendly of his mother to tell me.
Who is she?
Lady Anne Woods.
You can read it for yourself later.
He met her in Greece.
"Lady Anne Woods,
daughter of Sir H. Woods."
Oh, Mother, you got it wrong.
What Mrs. Durham wrote is
"I will now tell you the name
of the lady,
"Anne Woods,
daughter of Sir H. Woods."
Do you know her, Maurice?
Oh, yes.
Mr. Chapman, Miss Hall.
Thank you.
Ada.
Ada, I behaved badly to you
after Clive's last visit.
He, he never said those things
I let you think he said.
He never blamed you.
I don't care whether he did.
It doesn't signify, I love Arthur now.
Chapman's a good fellow.
For two people in love, to
marry strikes me as very jolly.
I wish you happiness.
Hello.
Mr. Hall, please.
Hall, Hall, for you.
Argentine Northern Land,
gone up again.
Hmm, up six.
Hello.
Hello, Maurice.
You'll have heard my news.
Yes, but you didn't write,
so I didn't.
Quite so.
Well, the wedding's next month.
You'll be an usher?
Best of luck.
Anne's with me.
She wants to talk, too.
I'm Anne Woods.
My name's Hall.
Maurice Christopher Hall.
Mine's Anne Clare Wilbraham Woods.
But I can't think of anything to say.
You're the eighth friend of Clive's
I've spoken to this morning like this.
Eighth?
Yes, the eighth.
I'll give Clive a turn, good-bye.
Maurice,
Anne has a hundred pounds
in her pocket, would
you invest it for her?
Certainly, what sort of thing?
Whatever you fancy.
I'm not supposed to fancy
more than four percent.
Barclay Perkins.
Brewing and distillers.
They're at five percent.
Or there's Argentine Northern Land.
They've gone up a sixth,
land investments.
How about--
I like the last one best.
Very well.
Send the check here, would you?
Can't you come
down to Pendersleigh next week?
It's short notice, I know,
but later everything's
gonna be chaotic.
I'm afraid I can't do that
very well.
Hill's getting married, too.
Things are more or less busy here.
And after that,
Chapman's marrying Ada.
Well, uh, come in September.
Not October, because that's almost
certainly the by-election.
But come in September
and see us through
that awful Park versus
Village cricket match.
All right.
You'd better write nearer the time.
All right.
Goodbye, then, Maurice.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
I mean, I haven't even
got a consulting room.
It's an illness too
awfully intimate for Jowitt.
You're the only doctor alive
I dare tell.
A secret trouble, eh?
Yeah, right, well, excuse me, my dear.
Won't be a moment.
Come along, then.
Now, now, now take your time.
And remember, of course,
that this is professional.
Nothing you say will ever
reach your mother's ears.
It's about women.
Well, we'll soon
fix that up.
Fix me, for God's sake.
I'm done for.
Now don't be afraid of me.
Now, when did you catch
the beastly thing?
It's nothing as filthy as that.
In my own wrong way
I've kept myself clean.
Oh, well, um, let's have a look.
Is that
you in there, Dr. Barry?
It's all right, Ettie.
I'm in here.
You're all right.
What do you mean, sir,
by "all right"?
Well, what I say.
You're a clean man.
Nothing wrong with you down there.
You could marry tomorrow if you like.
If you'll take an old
man's advice, you will.
So cover up now.
It's so, so drafty.
What put all this
into your head?
You've never guessed.
I'm like Lord Risley.
I'm an unspeakable.
The Oscar Wilde sort.
Rubbish, rubbish.
Dr. Barry, I can't have explained.
Now listen to me, Maurice.
Never let that evil hallucination,
that temptation from the
devil, occur to you again.
I mean, who put that lie
into your head?
You, whom I see and know
to be a decent fellow.
Dr. Barry, I want--
No, sir, I'll not discuss!
The worst thing I could
do for you is to discuss.
It's not rubbish to me.
Rubbish!
I've been like this
ever since I can remember,
without knowing why.
Am I diseased?
If I am, I want to be cured.
Find yourself a pretty young woman.
She'll soon cure you.
It's unspeakable.
Come, dress yourself.
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
Of course.
Ettie, whiskey.
Mine.
Sir.
Bull's-eye, one less bunny wunny
for Durham to lose sleep over.
What?
Oh, buck up, man.
Corpore sano.
Look out, mine!
Damn!
Will you gentlemen wish
to continue shooting?
The mist's coming down.
I suppose he thinks it's our fault.
Very well, Scudder.
We may as well pack it in.
You'll bring the game
book up to the house.
Oh, cheer up, old man.
What has got into you?
Would you believe it's my birthday?
Good Lord, is it really?
I say, old man, many happy returns.
Durham never mentioned it at all.
Durham's far too busy canvassing.
Come on.
Let's toast it in chiskey.
That's more like it.
Telegram arrived for you
at midday, sir.
Oh, thank you, Simcox.
There, you see?
Durham did remember your birthday.
Shall we have that drink?
Mm, two large chiskeys, Simcox.
Very good, sir.
I think I may have to go
to town with you tomorrow.
Hall, old fellow, what a pity.
You might have had more shooting.
Nothing wrong, is there?
No, have business.
Happy birthday, sir.
Hello, did you have
a good day shooting?
Frightful.
It's awfully rude of Clive
to have been here so little,
but he's working so hard.
And I do think it'll be a good idea
for the poor
if he does get in, don't you?
He's their best friend,
if only they knew it.
You can't worry too much
about the poor.
One must give them a leg up,
for the sake of the country,
but they don't suffer as
we should in their place.
I see we're in the hands of
the right sort of stockbroker.
Oh, here's the Reverend Borenius.
He's joining us for
dinner, do you know him?
He's come to scold Clive
about the tenants' housing.
Now, he would say that they want love.
No doubt they do,
but they won't get it.
Mr. Hall.
I scold Clive for being cynical,
but really, I think
you're being horrible.
I get used to being horrible.
The poor get used to their slums.
After you've banged about a bit,
you get used to your particular hole.
Everyone yaps at first.
I've had a telegram.
I've got to go back up
to town tomorrow.
Oh, no,
not bad news I hope.
No.
Well, in that case, it
must be an amorous intrigue.
Maurice has to go back
to London tomorrow.
What?
Well, that's what he told me.
But damn it,
he's only just arrived.
He had a telegram.
He's being awfully secretive.
He's being impossible.
What about the cricket?
I rather like him.
I have a private notion he's in love.
I think he has a little girl
up in London.
Your hand, Pippa.
Darling--
It's all right, Archie, I'll manage.
Mr. Borenius, your turn.
Oh, forgive me.
The family ghost again.
There's
the sweetest little hole
in the ceiling, Clive,
can't we leave it?
Well, we shall have to,
but let's move the pianoforte
because I don't think
it's going to stand much more.
How about a saucer?
Clive, how about a saucer?
Once the rain came through
the ceiling of the club.
I rang the bell and the
servant brought a saucer.
I ring the bell and the
servant brings me nothing.
Hmm.
I knew this beastly
present would come in useful.
Poor Pendersleigh.
Milly, bring a basin
will you, and a duster,
and get one of the men
to help shift the piano.
The rain's come through again.
We had to ring twice, twice.
It's got right
under the sounding board,
I'm afraid.
Can't
make it sound any worse
than it already does.
Shall I
place this lamp here?
Ah, Scudder.
Shift the piano, would you,
and, um, take up the carpet.
Tomorrow you'd better go up
and attack that roof again.
Well, there we are, everybody.
Perhaps we'd better turn
in, leave them to it.
Before we get carried
away on the flood tide.
Pippa, tell Simcox to bring
up my nightcap, will you?
The cellar will be awash by now.
Why is my house falling down?
Anne.
Maurice, are you coming up?
A saucer
would have done the job.
How very kind of you.
Down, down there a bit.
Little bit more.
More, bit more.
Down, down.
Someone will have to get up
in the night, change the bowl.
As soon as
my body developed,
the obscene imaginings began.
I thought that some individual
curse had descended on me.
My schooling was pure enough.
A terrific scandal there
before my arrival
meant that we were drilled all day,
and policed all night.
I had little chance, therefore,
to talk about such experiences
with my school fellows.
I am the only son in my fam--
Oh, Maurice,
I am glad.
Well, it's the greatest thing
on earth.
Perhaps the only one.
Anne guessed as much.
Aren't women extraordinary?
Oh, Maurice, it's what
I've always wished for you.
I know you have.
You don't mind if I tell her?
Only Anne, of course.
Not a bit, tell everyone.
You don't mind?
No.
I just wanted to show that,
I hadn't forgotten the past.
But I agree.
Let's not mention it again.
All right.
Aren't you glad
it's all ended properly?
How properly?
Well, instead of that
muddle last year.
With you.
Quits, and I'll go.
Come back here as soon
as you can, won't you?
Clive?
I've been talking to Maurice.
You were right.
Told you he had something
up his sleeve.
Make sure the
tarpaulin covers the cover.
Pull it down.
I think he's after a tip.
Tell him to boil his head.
I offered him five shillings,
but he wouldn't take it, damn cheek.
Best of luck.
I'm so glad you're not
really horrible.
Are you?
Good-bye, dear Maurice.
Good-bye.
You gave him more, I suppose.
Five shillings not good enough?
You'll only take gold?
I'll take it.
Clive.
You're coming back very soon.
Good luck.
Thanks, old man.
Cheerio, old man.
Archie, good-bye.
Good-bye.
Thank you, Simcox.
Good-bye.
Bye, Maurice.
Good-Bye.
See you soon.
Bye, Maurice.
Good-Bye.
I do wish I knew the girl's name.
You're not quite off yet, I think.
No, I'm not.
I'm nearer off now.
Hmm.
How do you like my consulting room?
It's a nice room.
Not too dark.
Rather dark.
You can see the picture
on the wall ahead of you?
Come nearer, Mr. Hall.
Take care of that crack
in the carpet, though.
How broad is the crack?
You can jump it.
Admirable.
Now, what do you suppose
this picture is of?
Whom is it of?
It is, Miss Edna May.
I want to go home to my mother.
Miss Edna May is beautiful.
She is attractive.
She's not attractive to me.
What an ungallant remark.
Oh...
Mr. Hall.
Look at her lovely hair.
I like short hair best.
Why?
Because...
Because...
Did it get anywhere near?
You're open to suggestion.
I made you see a picture
on the bare wall.
I'd, I'd like another appointment.
Telephone me in two weeks.
In the meantime, uh, take
exercise in moderation.
A little tennis,
stroll around with a gun.
Go back to the country.
It, it seems rather foolish
to make that journey twice in one day.
Hey old fellow.
Good Lord, you did rush
back, what a shame.
We're just off
electioneering overnight.
I'm sorry, I, I had no idea.
But I understood distinctly from you
that all your servants
had been confirmed.
I thought so.
I did think so, Mr. Borenius.
The trouble is, Mrs. Durham,
that even if the bishop
can be prevailed upon,
I have not time to prepare
him before he sails.
Mr. Hall.
Ah, Mr. Hall.
Simcox informed us
that you'd returned.
You're in time for dinner.
Did you have a successful trip?
That remains to be seen.
Dinner jacket's enough tonight.
I'm afraid we're only three.
Pardon me, sir.
Um, will the gentleman
be shooting tomorrow?
I don't think so.
Obviously not, it's the cricket match.
I'm sure, sir,
I'm very sorry if I failed
to give you and Mr. London
full satisfaction, sir.
That's all right, Scudder.
Glad to see you
down again so soon, sir.
That's all right, Scudder.
The way that Scudder
sprang his notice on Clive.
His brother has found him
a job in the Argentine.
His brother has got him
the fare, so off he goes.
Excuse me, sir.
The underkeeper wonders
whether you have orders.
I saw him before dinner, Simcox.
Nothing, thanks.
Tomorrow's the match.
I did tell him.
He wonders whether
the gentleman wished
to bathe between innings, sir.
He's just bailed out the boat.
If that's Scudder, will
you tell him I'll come
and speak to him directly?
Very good, sir.
Good night, sir.
Oh, Scudder.
Good night.
They tell me you're emigrating.
That's my idea, sir.
Well, good luck to you.
Thank you, sir.
Seems rather strange.
The Argentine, I understand.
That's right, sir.
Have you ever
visited it yourself, sir?
No.
No, England for me.
Night, sir.
Good night.
I'm off, then.
An easy start tomorrow.
Only Mr. Hall's pleasure to wait upon.
Mr. Hall's a gentleman.
Was that you calling to me, sir?
I know, sir.
It's all right, I know, sir.
Come on,
lie down.
Sir, the church has struck.
You'll have to release me.
Maurice.
Maurice.
There's the cricket
pitch I have to help roll
for the match,
and the young birds, too.
The boat's done.
Mr. London dived splack
into the water lilies.
They told me that all young
gentlemen learn to dive.
Well, I never learned to.
It seems more natural-like
not to let your head
get under the water.
I call that drowning before your day.
I was taught I'd be ill
if I didn't get my hair wet.
Well, you was taught
what wasn't the case.
Alec,
did you ever dream you had a friend,
someone to last your whole life?
Nice day, sir.
Nice day for the match.
Ah, he moved that ladder
away at last, I see.
About time.
Now, sir...
what will you wear, I wonder?
Will you put your cricketing
flannels on straightaway?
All right.
Oh, sir, in, uh,
Mr. Durham's absence,
the servants feel
we should be so honored
if you would captain us for the match.
I'm no cricketer, Simcox.
Who's your best bat?
We have none better than
the under gamekeeper, sir.
Scudder, sir.
Well, then make Scudder captain.
Pity, sir.
Things always go better
with a gentleman captain.
Tell him to put me to field deep.
And I won't bat first.
Bat eighth if he likes.
You might tell him, as I
shan't be down till it's time.
Very good, sir.
Oh, dear, sir.
Mud on the carpet.
I'll send someone up.
Very good, sir.
The captain's put
himself in to bat first.
Clive Durham would never
ave done that.
Little points
interest me.
He's our best man, apparently.
I've an instinct
the man's conceited.
He's lasted very well.
He's playing more carefully this year.
Run!
Run hard, Roger!
Throw it
to the bowler's end.
They're going two.
That's me.
Man in.
Go for it.
Jolly well done!
Marvelous!
Well done.
After it, Graham!
Chase hard.
Get it in hard.
Quick, they're going three,
they're going three, chase hard.
I do begin to see what you mean.
Well, with a haircut.
Go chase it, boy.
Wonderful!
Keep it up.
Jolly well done, Hall!
Bravo, bravo, well done.
Scudder's holding the fort for you.
He's doing rather well.
Well, I suppose I'd
better play for a bit,
please these people.
Over.
Simon.
Andrew, down to point.
Clive.
Maurice.
Aren't you exhausted?
Well, I've had
meetings till midnight.
I've got another this afternoon.
But I'm back tonight, and then
your visit really does begin.
Now, gentlemen.
We stand rebuked.
To the Olympic Games, Maurice.
Yes.
Take him, Simon!
No, wait, sorry, Maurice, sorry.
Get it in, Andy.!
Sorry.
Well played, Mr. Hall.
Thank you.
Ah, thank you, Simcox.
I know, sir.
It's all right.
I know, sir.
Come on.
What sort of man was that keeper
of yours who captained us?
Scudder?
Well, he's a little bit smart,
but Anne would say I'm being unfair.
You can't expect our standard
of honesty in servants.
What sort of background did he have?
Let's see, um, wasn't his
father the butcher at Osmington?
Yes, I think so.
Is your head feeling rotten again?
Putrid.
I do wish you'd think of
Pendersleigh as your second home.
Just treat it like an hotel.
Come and go when you like.
Doesn't matter if I'm home or not.
Anne feels as I do.
Pretend to the other gentlemen
that you want a stroll.
It's easily managed.
Then come down to the boathouse.
Dear sir, let me share with you once
before leaving old England.
It's not asking too much.
You should not resist me.
You're resisting me.
Damn it, I'm not.
You're less suggestible
than you were.
Don't give up.
I do not propose
to give up, Mr. Hall.
Have I fallen short of your 50%?
I needn't remind you that your sort
were once put to death in England.
I would advise you to
live in some country,
France, Italy, where homosexuality
is no longer criminal.
Will it ever be like that
in England?
England has always been disinclined
to accept human nature.
I have not told you the whole truth.
No, Mr. Hall?
Since I was here, I
went wrong, with the gamekeeper.
I'm terrified he may blackmail me.
Apparently, he's quite
smart enough to do so.
I have an idea
that's what's stopping me
from going into a trance.
He sent me a letter, you see.
Read it.
"Come to the boathouse.
"I have key and will let you in."
No doubt he has a duplicate key,
and an accomplice
waiting up at the house.
"I, since cricket
match, do long to place
"both arms around you
and share with you.
"The above now seems
sweeter than words can say.
"Mind and write if you don't come,
"for I get no sleep waiting.
"So come without fail to boathouse,
"Pendersleigh, tomorrow night.
"Yours respectfully, Alec Scudder,
"Gamekeeper to...
"C. Durham, Esquire."
I'm walking on a volcano.
He's an uneducated man, but
he's got me in his power.
Will he have a case in
court, do you think?
I'm no lawyer, Mr. Hall.
You'd have to consult your solicitor.
My children playing overhead.
How did a country lad
like that know?
Why did he come to me that one night
when I was at my weakest?
There we are, sir.
Just a moment.
Uh, ticket, please, ticket.
Maurice.
What, uh, what brings
you to London, Scudder?
My, um, brother and I
have, um, some business here.
You ought to know what it is.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.
Let me just have a word
with Scudder here.
Something's up at the mission.
Scudder, is it?
"Alec, you're a dear fellow,"
you said.
You did.
What mission?
What, you ashamed to be seen with me?
Hmm, you're not glad anyway.
Don't say you are.
Of course I'm glad.
Then why didn't you
come to the boathouse?
I waited two nights.
I got no sleep waiting.
Shh!
I know something.
I'm sure you do.
I'm sure you could tell me
a good many things, Alec.
I know about you and Mr. Durham.
This is your office, is it?
What do you do here?
You shouldn't treat me like a dog.
You was just amusing yourself.
I've never come like that
to a gentleman before.
You said, "Call me Maurice,"
but you never even wrote to me.
You made a fool of me, and
I can make you sorry for it.
He's big enough, isn't he?
Well, they must've owned
wonderful machinery
to make a thing like that.
I expect so.
Mine's got five legs.
So has mine.
It's a peculiar notion,
when you think about it.
It won't do, Mr. Hall.
I know what you're trying to do.
You'd do better to settle
this, I can tell you.
You've had your fun.
Now you've gotta pay up.
I'll leave you to think it over.
Surely, surely you're an old
boy at Mr. Abrahams's school.
Now, now, don't,
don't tell me your name.
I, I, I want to remember.
I shall remember.
Um, you're not Colgan.
You're not Smith, I know.
You're, you're Wimbleby, yes?
My name's Scudder.
Isn't, I'm Mr. Scudder.
And I've got a serious charge
to bring against this gentleman.
Yes, awfully serious.
My goodness me.
I am really most,
most frightfully sorry.
I, I, I do beg your pardon.
It's seldom I make a mistake.
Well, remarkable place,
this, isn't it?
Not just a collection of relics.
It's a place which could
stimulate the minds of the--
Less fortunate?
Well, quite so.
To ask questions which one,
which one no doubt
inadequately tries to--
Ben, we're waiting.
Oh uh, yes, quite so.
I, uh, I, I, excuse me.
Extraordinary thing.
I shan't trouble you any further.
Where are you going
with your serious charge?
I don't know what came over me.
You blackmailed me.
No, sir, no
You didn't?
Maurice, listen.
Maurice am I?
Well, you called me Alec.
I'm as good as you.
I don't find you are.
By God, if you'd split on me to Ducie,
I'd have broken you.
Might have cost me
hundreds, but I've got them.
But the police always back
my sort against yours.
As good as I?
Come outside.
It rained even harder
than this at the boathouse.
It was even colder.
Why did you not come?
I was frightened.
And you let yourself get afraid of me.
That's why we're trying
to down each other.
I wouldn't take a penny from you.
I don't want to hurt
your little finger.
Come on.
Let's give over talking, here.
Stop with me.
Sleep the night with me.
I, I can't.
I've got an engagement.
A formal business dinner.
It's my job.
Meet me another evening instead.
I can't come to London again.
My father or Mr. Borenius
will be passing remarks.
What does it matter if they do?
What does your engagement matter?
First time I seed you, I thought,
"I wish I had that one."
And it is so.
The only good thing to
happen to me at Pendersleigh.
"Scudder, do this.
"Scudder, do that."
The old lady, she says,
"Oh, would you most kindly
"of your goodness post this for me.
"What's your name?
"What's your name?"
Every day for bloody 18 months
I went to that front porch for orders
and the old bitch doesn't
even know my name.
I said to her, "What's your name?
"Fuck your name!"
Nearly did, too.
Wish I had.
And you, too grand to
come to the boathouse.
"Haw, my man.
"Five shillings not good
enough for you, eh?"
You've no idea how you
nearly missed gettin' me.
Boathouse was the place
I always fancied.
I still got the key now,
matter of fact.
We'll meet in your boathouse yet.
No, we won't.
You'll remember that at any rate.
Tomorrow's Thursday.
Friday's packing.
Saturday, Southampton, so
it's good-bye, old England.
You mean that you and I
shan't meet again after now?
That's right.
You got it quite correct.
Stay with me.
Stay, miss my boat?
You daft?
Of all the bloody rubbish.
Order me about again, you would.
It's a chance in a thousand we met.
You know it.
Why don't you stay?
Stay, with you?
How, and where?
With your ma?
Oh, yeah.
What would she say if she saw me?
All rough and ugly the way I am.
My people wouldn't take
to you one bit.
And I don't blame them either.
And how would you run your job,
I'd like to know?
I shall chuck it.
Your job in the city, what
gives you money and position?
You talk like a man who's
never had to earn his living.
You can do anything,
once you know what it is.
We can live without money,
without people.
We can live without position.
We're not fools.
We're both strong.
There'll be someplace we could go.
Wouldn't work, Maurice.
Be the ruin of us both.
Can't you see?
Well, I'm off.
Pity we ever met, really,
if you think about it.
You paid for this room
in advance, didn't you?
I mean, they won't stop
me downstairs or anything?
You'll be all right.
Edgar, I shan't be long.
Just wait for me.
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon.
Oh, yes, um, I've come
to see a passenger off.
Alec Scudder.
Ah, the Scudders.
Yes, I believe they're up there, sir.
Right, thank you.
Thank you very much, sir.
Plenty of time yet.
Oh, he won't be late.
If Alec says a thing, he means it.
He can be late if he likes.
I can manage without him,
but he needn't expect
me to help him anymore.
Mr. Scudder?
You must be Alec Scudder's brother.
I've come to see him off.
Alec ain't aboard yet,
but his kit is.
Interested to see his kit?
No, no, no, don't worry.
I'll just wait with you, if I may.
My name's Maurice Hall.
Good afternoon, Mr. Hall.
Now, this is kind of you, Mr. Hall.
I could hardly believe my eyes
when I saw you among his friends here.
Family, my parents.
And I'm his brother,
Frederick Scudder,
purveyor of viand, at your service.
Ah, I am Mr. Borenius.
Alec is one of my parishioners.
I've come to give him a
letter of introduction
to an Anglican priest in Buenos Aires,
in the hopes that he will
be confirmed after landing.
Very kind of you, sir, I'm sure.
How did you know so
precisely when the boat sailed?
It was advertised.
All aboard now.
May I speak frankly to you?
I'm far from easy about Scudder.
The fact is, he has been
guilty of sensuality
with women.
It's not just the deed of fornication.
When the nations went a-whoring,
they invariably ended up
by denying God.
Until all sexual irregularities,
and not some of them, are penal,
the church will never
again reconquer England.
I have reason to believe,
Scudder spent Tuesday night in London,
fornicating.
I'm telling you all this
because of your charitable
interest in him.
But surely he wouldn't
have missed his train.
Well, they wouldn't leave without him.
He's bloody well missed
his bleeding train!
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen, I do assure you,
Mr. Scudder was booked for a passage.
But his kit's aboard.
His kit's aboard.
Clive.
Don't tell Anne I'm here.
I've only a few minutes.
I mean, look here,
man, that's fantastic.
She'll be furious if you
don't stay the night.
Maurice, I hope nothing's wrong.
Pretty well everything.
You'd think so.
Very well, I'm at your service.
My advice, though, is
to sleep here tonight
and ask Anne in the morning.
Where a woman is in question,
it's always better to ask
another woman,
and particularly if she has
Anne's almost uncanny insight.
I'm not here to see Anne.
Or you, Clive.
It's miles worse for you.
I'm in love with Alec Scudder.
What a grotesque announcement.
Most grotesque.
But I felt I ought to tell you.
Maurice,
Maurice, we did everything we could
when you and I
thrashed out the subject.
When you brought
yourself to kiss my hand.
Don't allude to that.
Come in here.
I'm more sorry for you
than I can possibly say.
And I do, do beg you to resist
the return of this obsession.
I don't need advice.
I'm flesh and blood, Clive,
if you'll condescend
to such low things.
I've shared with Alec.
Shared, shared what?
Everything.
Alec slept with me in the Russet Room,
when you and Anne were away.
Oh, good God.
Also in town.
The sole excuse for
any relationship between
two men is that it remain
purely platonic.
Surely we agreed that.
I don't know.
I've come to tell you what I did.
Well, Alec, Scudder,
is in point of fact
no longer in my service.
In fact, he's no longer in England.
He sailed for Buenos Aires
this very day.
He didn't.
He sacrificed his career for
my sake, without a guarantee.
I don't know whether that's
platonic of him or not,
but it's what he did.
Scudder missed his boat?
Maurice, you're going mad.
May I ask if you intend to pursue--
No, no, you may not ask.
I'll tell you everything
up to this minute.
Not a word beyond.
Alec?
Alec.
So you got the wire, then?
What wire?
The wire I sent to your house,
telling you...
Oh, sorry.
I'm a bit tired, what with
one thing and another.
No, telling you to come here,
to the boathouse at
Pendersleigh without fail.
Now we shan't never be parted.
It's finished.
Will that be all, sir?
Yes, thank you, Simcox.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
Come on!
Who were you talking to?
No one, no one.
I was just trying out a speech.
$&$Ryans Tochter$&$
Give it over, Michael.
Thanks.
Rose!
- Yours?
- Aye.
My dad got it
when they sold up Lady Pawson's.
Lady Pawson, is it?
Fine fish, Michael.
Give him a smile and you'll maybe get
one of the claws for your supper.
COLLINS: Michael!
I've told you, Michael,
they're created creatures!
Get off!
It'll make me sick!
Poor Mike's no answer
to a young maid's dreams...
but do you not think
he just possibly knows that?
I can't abide him, Father Hugh.
You used to ride to school on his back.
- I can walk for myself now.
- Aye.
Where are you walking this afternoon
dressed up like that?
- Nowhere precisely.
- Just so.
What do you do, Rose,
mooning about all day by yourself?
Read.
- Well, I wasn't really reading it.
- You're doing nothing, then?
- I suppose so.
- Have you nothing to do?
Precisely that!
Well, Miss Precisely, that's a pity.
Doing nothing is a dangerous occupation!
Morning.
- Blowy day?
- That's right, Corporal.
It's the wind.
Only want to be friendly, kids.
Then go back to London
and write us a letter.
- Don't come from London, love.
- Go anyway.
- Morning, Mr. O'Connor.
- Good morning to you, Corporal.
MOUREEN: Will you listen to that now?
Aren't the police a dirty lot,
hobnobbing with the British soldiers?
I heard that, Moureen Cassidy.
You were meant to, Constable O'Connor.
[Men laughing]
Hey, Michael!
MOUREEN: Michael, darling,
show us your fish.
[Jeering]
How much does he weigh then, Mike?
WOMAN: How long is it, Michael?
I've never seen a lobster the equal of that.
- Michael, can I touch it?
- Come here and show it to us, Michael.
Michael.
[Sharp whistle]
Now what? Now what?
What am I to do with you? What?
- Actually it's only a bit of fun, Father.
- Fun?
Are you brainless, Moureen Cassidy,
or what?
Fun.
Devil take me if the lot of you
is not possessed and damned.
I don't know what's the matter
with the youngsters in this place.
I don't at all.
Their talk is filthy, their doings are secret,
and cruelty for fun.
Unemployment is the matter with them,
Father Hugh.
It's the deliberate policy
of the British government...
that Irish youngsters
shall corrupt in idleness.
Well, it's working fine.
I just seen your Rosy
loafing about the beach again.
How much you give
for that black lace umbrella?
Three and six.
You'll ruin that girl.
It's time she had a fellow of her own, Tom.
A house of her own. Floors to scrub.
My princess isn't interested
in fellows, Father.
Your princess has fellows enough in here.
And fellows running loose in there
will do a girl more damage...
than a barrack full of drunk dragoons.
[Men laughing]
Well...
if there's one of that lot as is fit for her,
maybe you'll point him out, Father.
Rose.
Mr. Shaughnessy.
Well...
this is nice, Rose.
Well, you're back, then?
Yes, I'm back, and I...
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
I came to meet you.
Well, that was kind.
A party of us went to a couple of concerts
while we were there.
I saved you the programs.
- "The Royal Philharmonic."
- Berlioz and Tchaikovsky.
- No Beethoven?
- No Beethoven.
Do you know that the British government
has got a law now...
- forbidding the playing of German music?
- No.
- Can you imagine such foolishness?
- British.
Well, all governments is foolish,
more or less.
An Irish government would be the same.
Well, maybe.
Thank you.
- You enjoyed yourself in Dublin, then?
- Well, I did and I didn't.
A conference of village schoolteachers,
you know, is not exactly a...
- Bacchanalia?
- Bacchanalia. Precisely.
We did have some
interesting discussions, though.
There was a lady teacher among us
from Belfast, a stimulating woman.
Oh.
- Did she come to the concert?
- She had the score.
In what way, precisely,
was she stimulating?
She had a fine and fresh mind, Rose.
Very modern in her thoughts.
She'd been at the teaching
for over 50 years.
Old folk with fresh minds
are very stimulating.
Then there was a ministry inspector,
he gave us an address...
But the best we had was this professor
from the Sorbonne.
Now, there was a man with a mind,
if you like.
- Why? What did he say?
- I couldn't tell you, Rose.
Whatever it was, it was wasted on us.
Teachers are a poor lot, surely.
If teachers were the poor lot,
like you're always making out...
how would the pupils be learning
such riches?
What?
Some young fellow's
going to be a lucky man.
- Rose?
- I've something in my eye.
Rose.
The nuisance.
- Will I get it out, then?
- Oh, no, it's nothing.
It's only the wind.
- Are you away to the schoolhouse, then?
- No, Rose, I think...
I'll scramble up the dunes
and pay my respects to my wife.
Oh, yes.
Good day, Rose.
Good day, Mr. Shaughnessy.
Hello, Michael.
- Shaughnessy.
- There you are, Mr. Shaughnessy.
So, you're back again, Charles.
Home is the voyager, safe from the sea.
- The usual?
- Thanks.
And...
what did you see in Dublin?
- You mean, the trouble?
- What else?
Well, nothing, really.
- Did you not go and see Sackville Street?
- I passed it, yes.
- Passed it?
- Well, I'll be damned.
What did you see
as you passed it, Charles?
- It did look terrible smashed about, Father.
- It's true, then.
- The Government used guns.
- I've not said that, Father.
All right, you've not said anything.
What did you hear?
I heard they used heavy guns...
like them they're using on
the Western Front against the Germans.
And our poor lads
pursued from house to house...
with not one rifle between three.
Now, if the Germans
had an ounce of sense...
they'd send us guns
to use against the British.
That's treason you're talking.
And friends that are listening
surely to God.
It's foolish, all the same.
You'll blather yourself into jug some day.
Charles, what do they say they'll do
with the lads they've got in prison?
They say they'll hang them, Father.
Good luck to all Irishmen.
Bad luck to the British.
Success to the Germans.
And...
And a very good morning to you, Corporal.
Two black stouts, please, Mr. Ryan.
And one for yourself?
Well, seeing you're a man of wealth,
Corporal, yes.
- Father?
- No.
- Mr. Shaughnessy?
- Well, I don't mind if I--
[Collins clears throat]
No, I'd best be on my way.
Term is starting tomorrow, you know...
It seems the Jerries...
are giving your brave lads out there
a terrible scrimmage, then.
Aye.
You see, Tom,
Jerry's a tougher proposition...
than unarmed Irish children.
So far as I know, Mr. McCardle,
no children were killed.
[Ryan laughs]
All right, then. There were.
They get you in this uniform.
You point your gun
where you're told to point it...
and you pull the trigger.
And so does Jerry.
CORPORAL: And so would you.
You've seen that place,
Passchendaele, maybe?
No, not Passchendaele.
- You're well out of it, Corporal.
- That's right.
[Knocking on door]
Well, duty calls.
Good day, Charles.
Well, good day.
Welcome home.
Will you imagine that fellow?
A fortnight in Dublin.
Does nothing, sees nothing.
It's working with children,
makes a man childish.
No, it was that wife of his,
knocked all the spirit out of him.
She was a good, pure woman.
- Pure, she was.
- Is that nothing?
Oh, no. No.
[Door opening]
[Door shutting]
[Footsteps]
[Beethoven's Fifth Symphony playing
on gramophone]
[Footsteps]
Well, did you come
to lend me a hand, then?
Well, now, let's see.
For a start, you could put the kettle on.
I didn't come for that at all.
I've come to say something.
I feel like a child in this place.
And I'm not a child.
Do you know that?
I know that.
Rose, I've...
maybe an idea of what you came to say.
You have no idea at all.
Well, I'm just saying, in case it helps a bit,
I maybe have.
I love you.
- Will you come inside?
- No.
Will you sit down, then?
- Why?
- I'd like to talk to you, Rose.
Well, I know what that means.
Rose, this sort of thing can come about,
you know...
a girl taking a fancy to a teacher.
- Thanks.
- Fancy's all it is, Rose.
Rose, you've mistaken a penny mirror
for the sun.
Do you not see that?
I see you always digging a low pit
for yourself...
when you should be standing
on a heap of pride.
Well, Rose...
your coming here today
and saying what you've said...
is the only cause I've ever had for pride.
Don't you see, Rose?
I only taught you about...
Byron and Beethoven and Captain Blood.
I'm not one of them fellows myself.
- I'm not daft, you know.
- But you're terribly young.
- Aye, and that's a hanging matter, isn't it?
- No, it's not.
Well, then?
It's not a hanging matter to be young...
but it maybe should be a hanging matter
for a man of middle age...
to try and steal the youth
from a young girl.
Especially a man like me
and a girl like you.
You were meant for the wide world, Rose,
not this place, not this.
Me, I was born for it.
It wouldn't do, Rose.
I just know it wouldn't.
So you don't want me, then?
Don't want you?
- Yes.
- Oh.
Would you like a fat pheasant, Constable?
It'll cost you nothing.
Whoa.
He recognized you.
- Well, you'll have to be quick--
- Shut up!
Bring the cart!
CONSTABLE: Jesus.
- Fine pair of gunrunners we are.
- Come on.
[Crashing]
We'll never walk to the coast,
Commandant.
- It's 200 miles.
- We'll walk to Limerick.
- Limerick?
- The lads are waiting for us.
- Oh.
- And cheer up, Pat.
They're waiting with a lorry.
About 30 fellows.
Now...
marriage is a sacrament ordained by God.
That means, Rosy...
once it's done, it's not up to me,
nor you, nor Charles. It's done...
- till one or other of you is dead.
- I understand that.
God ordained it for three reasons.
First, that Charles and you
should be a comfort to each other...
in the long, dull days
and the weary evenings.
- Do you understand that?
- Yes.
Secondly, for the procreation of children,
and to bring them up as good Catholics.
- Well, you understand that.
- Yes.
And, thirdly...
- for the satisfaction of the flesh.
- Yes.
Are you scared of that?
Yes.
It's nothing to be scared of, Rosy.
A function of the body.
I suppose all girls is a bit scared before.
And fellows, too.
- Yes?
- Oh, yes.
It will make me a different person,
won't it?
- Marriage?
- No, the satisfaction of the flesh.
That's a gate
I have not been through myself...
but, no, it won't make you
a different person.
I want it to.
Child, what are you expecting?
[Sea gulls cawing]
Wings, is it?
All right, try it.
Seven boats. All currachs.
One thing at a time. Keep a look out.
PAT: Top of the morning, Father.
Morning!
- Morning, Father.
- Morning, tinker.
You'll find nothing much here.
It all gets carried round the head to Killins.
Ah.
- Good luck with it, anyway.
- Thanks, Father.
And if them two's tinkers,
I'm the Bishop of Cork.
Now, we'll have one light on the beacon...
and one on the cliff.
- What now, then? Back to Dublin?
- Tomorrow.
I want to see what Ryan's like.
[Women talking]
Are you not done, Mrs. McCardle?
Easy, Mr. Ryan, dear.
They'll not start without her.
Women.
Tim, did you review the volunteers
in Phoenix Park before the war?
- Yes, why?
- Will you come here?
Aye, you're looking at me picture, lads.
Here.
You recognize someone?
- That's yourself, landlord.
- It is.
And he that has me by the hand...
- is Commandant Tim O'Leary.
- Never.
Red Tim himself.
That 1,000 secret policemen...
have been hunting for
these last five years.
And himself, no doubt at this very moment
walking the broad streets of Dublin.
- He's a brave man, surely.
- Nerves of steel.
You know him well, then?
- I get my orders from time to time.
- Landlord, you're a desperate man.
I'll tell you something.
[Door opening]
- Come on then, Mr. Ryan.
- Right, ma'am.
PAT: Good luck to the young lady.
Talk.
This whole cursed country
will capsize with talk.
The locals are no good.
I'll have to bring you
some hard lads from Dublin...
when the time comes.
- When will that be, Commandant?
- I don't know.
Depends on our clever lads in Germany.
And they're great talkers, too.
With this ring, I thee wed.
CHARLES: With this ring, I thee wed.
In the name of the Father...
the Son...
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
This gold and silver, I give thee...
token of all my worldly goods.
[Irish music playing]
[Inaudible whispering]
Good night, Father Hugh.
Good night, Rosy.
Well, is no one going to kiss the bride?
Steady, lads. Steady!
Michael?
Get off out of it!
Enough. Now, cut it out.
Now, then. That's enough. Come on, boys.
That's enough.
RYAN: Now, lads, that's enough.
[Irish music playing]
- Lucky man, and how are you feeling?
- Lucky.
Are you all right, princess?
It was only their bit of fun.
Good night, Father.
Good night, Rosy.
Now, go on, away in with you.
Well, you'll be away early in the morning,
I suppose?
We will, yes, Mr. Ryan.
You're a wonderful girl, Rose.
No.
No, I'm not.
[Crowd laughing and cheering]
YOUNG MAN: Charles, how you getting on?
CHARLES: Them fellows
has an elegant sense of humor.
It doesn't matter.
YOUNG MAN: Charles, get a handful of this.
[Grain thrown on window]
RYAN: Now, come away.
- Rose?
- Yes?
Are you all right?
Yes.
- Good night, Rose.
- Good night, Charles.
[Bell ringing]
Rose?
I got you these.
They're all growing, see?
- When did you do it?
- Last thing yesterday. Just before church.
Charles, you're a rare man.
Well done.
- Here, no.
- They're not heavy.
I can't believe you're here.
Well, I am.
Well, now.
[Beethoven playing on gramophone]
Beethoven.
I...-
I don't think
you care much for my flowers, do you?
I like them better growing, surely.
Well, sure, things are better growing.
I'm afraid you're too late for snapdragons.
Well, I'll put in some lilies, then.
I like them.
- What's the matter?
- My shirt, Rose. I'd like to get my shirt.
Charles, you're fine as you are.
Well, all right, Rose.
I don't know, Rose,
suppose somebody came in.
Charles.
- You're always on about if someone came.
- Well, it's not decent.
- Decent.
- Well, it's not, you know.
All right, then.
I'm sorry, Charles.
Put it on.
No.
What does it matter?
No, you're right. Please, put it on.
No, well, I'll be out again in a minute.
Six ones are six.
Six twos are twelve.
Six threes are eighteen.
Six fours are twenty-four.
Six fives are thirty.
Six sixes are thirty-six.
Six sevens are forty-two.
Six eights are forty-eight.
- Six nines are...
- Fifty-four.
FEW-four.
Six tens are sixty.
Six elevens are sixty-six.
Six twelves are...
Seventy-two.
Now, your work is on the board.
You've all got your pencils.
There's no need for talking, Kathleen.
Now get on with it.
Get on.
Rose?
Rose.
- Where are you going, Rosy?
- Nowhere.
You're in the devil of a hurry there.
Now, stop.
Now, what exactly is the trouble
between you and Charles?
No. No trouble.
Are you asking me to believe
you're happy?
- I'm not asking you anything.
- Are you happy?
No.
Why not?
I don't know.
- Come on, Rosy, now give me a try.
- I don't.
All right.
Because I am stupid and conceited...
and self-centered and ungrateful
like you've always told me.
For I have everything I wanted, have I not?
You have!
- What more are you wanting now?
- I don't know that, either.
- That's a lie.
- It's not.
How can I know?
I don't even know what more there is.
- You've got a good man now, haven't you?
- The best.
Well?
And you've got enough money.
Not much, but enough.
Aye.
And you've got your health.
- You're not sick?
- No.
There is nothing more, you graceless girl.
- But, there is.
- There is not.
I know there is.
- There must be, Father Hugh.
- Why?
Glory be to God, why must there be?
Because Rosy Ryan wants it?
Aye.
Have you got any warm old clothes, Rosy?
Poor Patsy Wheelan's in a bad way.
I'll find some, Father.
Uh-huh.
Thanks.
Rosy, don't nurse your wishes.
You can't help having them,
but don't nurse them...
or sure to God,
you'll get what you're wishing for.
Major Doryan, sir.
Sorry, sir, I had to change a wheel.
Sir.
Get in.
In!
[Jeep motor humming]
CORPORAL: Come on, kids, out of it.
You were in Second Battle
of the Marne, weren't you, sir?
- Yes.
- So was I, sir.
- Yes?
- It was too much for me, sir.
I reckon that's why they sent me here.
Camp coming up, sir.
SERGEANT: Slope...
arms.
Capt. Smith, sir.
Hey.
That's all we're short of, that is.
A crippled bloody hero.
Well, now, sir.
This is our communication
with the outside world.
Field telephone to the police station
down the village.
Now, then. Records.
[Telephone ringing]
CONSTABLE O'CONNOR: Hello?
Constable O'Connor here.
Were you calling?
CAPTAIN SMITH: No, no, Constable,
just testing.
Well, now, sir, where was I?
CAPTAIN SMITH: Oh, aye. Records.
Records. Transport.
They're sending a...
Well, I guess you'd better see your room.
Well, now, duty.
Our duties are light.
Oh, good lad, Jimmy.
Jimmy will look after you right nicely,
Major Doryan.
CAPTAIN SMITH: Tired?
Yes.
- That leg gives you gyp, don't it?
- Yes.
Sent you here for a rest, did they?
Yes, I think they did.
Well, you'll get that, if naught else.
There's nothing to do here but walk.
Oh, I'm sorry. I expect walking's out.
No, I'm supposed to walk.
Five miles a day.
Oh. Well, then.
They've sent you to the right place.
There's some nice walks here.
Our duties are light enough, God knows.
Our duties.
It's more like police work, isn't it?
The publican's a source of information.
- An informer?
- Aye. Publican, name of Ryan.
Well, he's nothing to inform, has he?
But the police slip him a fiver
now and then, you know.
[Mumbles assent]
Oh, he's all right.
Big mouth, open hand,
empty pocket, you know?
Typical publican. But he's all right, really.
CAPTAIN SMITH: Jimmy.
JIMMY: Sir?
- Are my bags on the lorry?
- Yes, sir.
I'll be straight off, if it's all the same, sir.
- I've given myself leave.
- Yes?
Embarkation leave.
France.
Second battalion, Southeast Lancashires.
They're in the front line.
Will you tell me something, man to man?
What's it like, really?
Front line?
Aye. Well...
I'll find out soon enough.
I'm a coward, you see.
No, I always have been.
From being a lad.
I can't master it.
Well, perhaps I've never tried, really.
But, I'd give my left arm to have
a bit of what you've got.
I hate it.
Just the bloody thought of it
gives me the shakes.
That's my nightmare, as a matter of fact,
the shakes.
I don't mind dying.
Not if it's quick. Life's not that much, is it?
I wouldn't mind a gammy leg
like you've got.
Though I don't suppose it's funny.
But the shakes?
Shell shock.
Just shaking and shambling
like a epileptic baby.
Nay, I'd rather be dead.
I can see what's coming.
I'm going to disgrace myself.
You don't know what you'll do.
No one does.
You don't know what you're doing.
Really?
I read what you did in the newspapers.
That were no flash in the pan.
You'd do the same again, I dare say.
You'd be wrong.
Well, you've done your bit.
It's someone else's turn now, eh?
Oh, dear. You look about finished, sir.
Here.
Good stuff, this. Cheap, too.
[Generator thudding]
That's the generator.
The bloody thing stays on all night,
but you'll get used to that.
[Flicking switches]
This your house?
- Yes.
- Well, I never.
- Wife?
- Yes.
- May I?
- Please.
Oh.
Bonny woman.
Thank you.
- She'll be coming out, then?
- No, I don't think so.
There's no local crumpet.
It's married or virgin here, you know.
And that priest down there
has got eyes in the back of his head.
It gets bloody lonely here.
Why not have her out?
Sorry.
Fools rush in, eh?
You're probably better on your own a bit.
Excuse me.
I'll pop back to say goodbye.
It's him.
[Mockingly] Peg leg.
Sir?
Excuse me,
I didn't realize you were serving.
Well, I'm just minding.
What did you want?
Whiskey.
ROSE: Water?
Did you want water?
Please.
Thank you.
[Tapping]
[Tapping intensifies]
[Children shouting]
I must open the door.
Sit, please.
- Is this where you live?
- What?
Is this where you live?
- I live at the schoolhouse.
- Schoolhouse?
- I'm married to the teacher.
- Oh.
They're back.
- I don't know your name.
- Shaughnessy, Rose Shaughnessy.
Come away in, then.
One round on the house!
That's my dad.
Your father is the publican?
Yes, why not?
Now, I can't just say
you're very welcome, sir.
Not in your official function.
But in yourself, you're welcome.
A brave man is a brave man
in any uniform.
English khaki, Irish green, aye,
or German gray.
Aye, you've a large mind, sir.
Put it there.
You've met my daughter, then?
Yes.
All right, everyone,
the Major isn't a peep show.
Princess.
Guess what your old dad's
got for you this time from the fair?
Guess.
- I don't know, Father.
- Come and look.
RYAN: Now, then.
ROSE: Father, you can't afford it.
Oh, it's nothing.
Just a little blood mare
I picked up at the fair, is all.
- She's a Connemara.
- All right.
You look as if you'd be a judge, sir.
Maybe you'll favor us with your opinion.
Now.
It's a fine horse, Mr. Ryan.
- Are you away, then?
- Yes.
Good day, Mr. Ryan, Mrs. Shaughnessy.
[Door shutting]
MOUREEN: Snob!
RYAN: Of course he's a snob.
Isn't that what the English is famous for?
ALL: Aye.
On the house.
CHARLES: Hello.
Did you see our lord and master, then?
CHARLES: I did. Fine looking young man.
RYAN: Blather.
[Children singing Ave Maria]
[Paper shuffling]
[Door closing]
- [Whispering] Will you meet me tomorrow?
- [Whispering] How?
[Horse neighing]
Where?
- The tower.
- What tower?
Ask.
When?
- 3:00?
- Yes.
Whatever is this, darling?
It must be the lilies.
You're restless, Rosy.
Yes, I am a bit.
I think maybe
I'll take Princess out tomorrow.
Aye, yes, do that.
It'll please your father.
[Breathing heavily]
How long will you be here?
Till I ask to be sent back.
To the front?
To my unit.
They're at the front.
You'll not do that?
No. Not now.
Not now.
Oh, darling.
Darling.
[Horses galloping]
MAJOR DORYAN: Tomorrow?
ROSE: if I can.
Good night, darling.
Good night.
[Door opening]
Rosy.
- Hello, Charles.
- Hello, Rose.
Where've you been, Rose?
What's happened, Rosy?
- Princess took a fall.
- Rose, no.
I'm fine. I'll just change.
It was my own fault, really.
I put her at a ditch she wasn't up to, and...
she lay on my leg and wouldn't get up.
- Your leg, darling? Let me have a look.
- It's nothing at all.
- If you're sure.
- I'm certain sure. It's nothing.
But she wouldn't get up for anything.
Do you know
who came to get me out of it?
That new English officer.
- Major Doryan?
- Aye, him.
He came and got her up.
Well, that was lucky.
- What have you been doing?
- Waiting for you.
You mustn't worry about me, darling.
I can ride.
You can ride Champion, surely.
But the mare's not properly broke, Rose.
Rose, she's not properly broke.
Well, Major what's-his-name
did say he'd help me.
- With the horse?
- Aye.
But, I don't suppose he meant it.
- He looks a man of his word to me.
- Does he, Charles?
Seems like a fine young fellow all around.
You always think the best of people,
don't you?
Why not?
Well, we'll see.
- Could you eat some supper?
- I could have a go at it, yes.
Rose?
Yes?
You'd never be unfaithful to me,
would you?
Charles.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked that.
Shhh...
That's a rotten question
for a man to ask his wife.
TIM: Sir, what's that there?
What's that?
Well, that's not the cuttlefish
that I told you to look for.
That's for a start. That is an insulator.
Aye, an insulator, that is.
Probably off a German battleship.
I'm sure there's no German battleships
coming here, sir.
- You don't know, there might be.
- No, Timmy's right.
Now, tell me this.
Why is there so much stuff
around Killins Bay?
It's a tide... Tidal eddy around the head.
Tidal eddy. Very good, Tim. Good.
All right, come on, now. Go on looking.
The tide's going down. Go on, hurry up.
Go on, Kathleen. Off with the others.
You never know,
you might find a diamond tiara.
Sir, sir.
Aye, that's a cuttlefish.
- Good lad.
- I'll try and find a bigger one.
You do that, Tim.
Come on.
What is it, sir?
No, it's nothing. Nothing.
'Tis all right, Kathy.
Come on.
Time we had lunch.
We're eating at Barrow.
It's a long way to Barrow, sir.
Step off, then. That's where we're eating.
Tide's coming in, sir.
So it is.
Hey, would you look at Michael?
Michael.
It's the Major.
Hey, Tom, will you have a look at this?
He's getting worse, you know.
Michael, let's have a look at your V.C.
- How many Germans did you kill, Michael?
- All right.
All right, very entertaining.
Michael, you're a perfect fool.
You ask for trouble.
Come on, now, take the foolish things off.
Michael, take them off, now. Come on.
Michael!
What's eating him?
- What've you been doing?
- Don't know, Father.
MOUREEN: We've not done anything.
Come on now, Michael. What're you up to?
[Horse galloping]
ROSE: Let go!
Michael, let go, or I'll hit you.
Michael, darling, let go.
Major, darling, let me touch your V.C.
You see, my husband hasn't got one.
Well?
Well.
What was the meaning
of that pantomime?
I don't know.
- Where have you been?
- Riding...
- with Major Doryan.
- You're bold as brass.
You think that's a suitable connection
for a decent Irish wife?
I think that is for my husband to say,
Father Hugh.
- You've told him, have you?
- Yes.
Yes, you would.
Your husband would say anything
you wanted, pretty well...
because he loves you sorely, doesn't he?
- Yes, he does.
- Have you nothing to say to me?
- What should I have to say to you?
- You could say:
"Father Hugh, there's nothing
between me and Major Doryan."
- There isn't.
- Say it, then.
There is nothing between me
and Major Doryan.
Look at me, Rosy.
Oh, child, what a face.
[Door opening]
- Rose, tell me now.
- What?
You'll have to tell it in confessional,
you little fool.
I don't have to come...
- to the confessional.
- Child!
Child?
- Father.
- Hello, then.
Rosy...
was there something?
No, I just...
- Will you take the prayers, then?
- Aye.
ALL: "Our Father...
âwho art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done...
"on Earth as it is in heaven.
"Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses...
"as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
"And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil."
In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost.
All right, children, off with you.
Thank you, Father. Good day.
Glad to help, Charles.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
No, I don't think so.
Well, I'll be off home, too, then.
- You're late.
- I took them for a nature walk.
Up Brandon?
Along the shore.
- For cuttlefish?
- Aye.
For cuttlefish.
If you'd come up Brandon,
we might have seen you.
Why?
- Did you go to Brandon?
- Aye.
I got some heather.
So you did.
You haven't been to the beach, then?
No.
Oh, well.
- It's nice up Brandon.
- Aye, it's grand.
[Door opening]
Is something the matter?
I don't know, Rose. Is there?
There's nothing the matter with me.
Nothing's the matter, then.
And the jam, and the...
The jam...
and the soap.
Maggie.
That'll be 18 pence.
Could it wait
to the end of the week, missus?
Aye, to the end of the week.
Not to the crack of doom.
Thank you.
- What was it, then?
- I want a dishcloth, please.
- I've none.
- Oh.
Then I'll just take some potatoes.
Five pound.
I've no potatoes, either.
What's them, then?
Aye, them.
They're gone. I've no potatoes.
Oh, I... I see.
The way I see it, Mrs. Kenyon,
there's loose women and there's whores...
and then there's British soldiers' whores.
- Coming up fast, Father.
- Aye.
Will you look at those things?
You'd think they was announcing
the coming of Christ.
MAN 1: Off you go!
MAN 2: Right.
Put her down!
Slowly does it.
[Singing] In the valley of Slievenamon
Alone, all alone
All right, now! That's it.
Come on, Joe, there's a good lad.
Come on, it's late.
All right. Come on, Sean.
Come on, Tom. You've got to go to sleep.
Go on. Good night!
Hello, Tom.
- You? What are you doing here?
- Come on, now, Tom.
Phoenix Park, 1913.
Tim O'Leary.
Come on.
Right, lads.
Now, what do you usually do
at this time, Tom?
- I go to bed.
- Right.
This is Bernard. Go on up, lads.
- Paddy.
- Paddy.
Sean.
Joseph, Peter...
Mr. O'Keefe.
- And you know Pat.
- Which room?
At the back.
But, Commandant, sir, what's happening?
Guns, is it?
- That's right, Tom. German guns.
- German?
Dynamite, grenades.
All the stuff the movement needs.
We tried to launch the boat...
[Wind howling]
- You must get to them somehow, then.
- We can't.
But Sean here says there's a good chance
some of it will break away and come to us.
- Float in?
- You're on to it.
But, if it does, we won't know where.
You can't see the nose on your face
out there now.
So we'll wait till daylight.
- Absolute madness.
- Will you shut up?
Tom...
if it's to be done in daylight,
it's to be done quick.
So we must have some fellows,
say a dozen...
good, strong fellows,
and that's where you come in.
But, but, but...
RYAN: What if it don't break away?
TIM O'LEARY: Exactly.
Then we'll wait one hour
and go without it.
One hour, Tom...
and 12 strong men. That's all I'm asking.
Can you do it?
I could rout out a dozen, yes.
- Do you want them now?
- Not at all.
The later they know we're here, the better.
You let them lie till nearer morning.
Can you find us something to eat?
It's gonna be a long night.
[Glass breaking]
Paddy, Tom.
Take the Constable his breakfast.
Jesus and Mary, what a night.
Now, do not make one sound, Constable.
Right. You.
Fat guts, get the handcuffs.
- Where are they?
- In the cupboard.
Turn around.
- I'm acting under duress.
- Shut up.
Put them on him.
Open your mouth, Constable.
[Groans]
[Buzzing]
Is that a telephone line?
Cut it.
Oh, God.
Why have you done this to me?
Hello?
This is Ryan.
- Did you cut the wire?
- I did.
You're doing well, Tom.
- Where's the Constable?
- In the cellar.
We can put a bullet in him if you like.
Constable... No!
- Then get your men.
- Aye, Commandant.
Right.
[Wind howling]
They've gone!
Busted loose!
It's no good, Commandant!
Why don't you get up out of it
while you can?
Tim!
- Hey, are you Tim O'Leary?
- Yes, son, yes.
Father, what the hell
have you done this for?
I didn't, they did!
Well, do you know what you're doing?
- Do you know what we've come for?
- Aye.
- Have you got it?
- Well, look.
- T'will be on the slabs.
- Where?
The slabs!
Tim!
Come on.
Yes, Kathy?
- Aren't you coming to the beach, sir?
- The beach?
Everyone's at the beach.
- And why is everyone at the beach?
- I don't know, sir. I think it's a wreck.
A wreck?
[Waves crashing]
Now, that's enough, Tom.
You're not as young as you used to be.
Aye, come on!
Oh, God.
Pull!
TIM O'LEARY: Right, up you get.
You, too, Father. Up. Keep it going.
That's right, darling.
That's right.
Hey!
Dynamite.
What are you doing here?
- Why shouldn't I be?
- Why?
Thank you, ma'am.
You know, we made speeches
about these people...
but, by God...
Thanks. You're a man!
Come on, then!
FATHER COLLINS: One!
Two!
Three!
[Engine stops]
Sean?
- I must take a chance.
- Aye.
Good luck.
Thank you. Get down, please.
MAJOR DORYAN: Sergeant?
SERGEANT: Sir.
SERGEANT: You, here. You.
No. No trouble now, for your own sakes.
O'Leary.
That thing could kill a lot of people, Major.
Sir?
No.
Go on. Run, Tim!
Run, Tim.
Make it, Tim. Come on!
- Run.
- O'Leary!
Sir.
- No!
- No!
- Murderer!
- Don't shoot.
What's wrong with the bastard?
Boo!
MAN: Shoot that slut, Shaughnessy.
Careful, man.
WOMAN: My God, they're
a well-matched pair.
All right, sir?
- Got a cigarette?
- Yes, sir.
Is there anything you want?
Cigarette.
- Anything else?
- Yes.
Get out of my country.
God bless you, Tim O'Leary!
What are they going to do
with them boys, Father?
They'll hang them, dear.
They'll hang them.
Bastard!
Bastard!
WOMAN: Get out!
You're very kind to me today.
Am I?
Yes. Why?
Am I not usually kind to you?
Yes, you are. Always.
Charles, do you know or not?
I know.
- Since when?
- The beginning.
Don't lower your head, Rose.
[Car driving by]
Why didn't you speak?
I should have, shouldn't I?
I don't know.
It was easier not to, I suppose.
I didn't want to know, you know.
And then I thought, if I let you burn it out,
the pair of you...
you'd perhaps come back to me.
[Generator vibrating]
Charles?
Charles?
Mr. Shaughnessy has been called away,
so I'm taking class.
What's the first lesson today, Danny?
- Danny?
- My father says not to speak to you, miss.
[Footsteps approaching]
[Door opening]
- It's right then, he's not here?
- No.
I don't know where he is.
- You mean he's gone off?
- Yes.
When?
Last night.
You had a row?
I wasn't here.
Where were you?
Oh, I see.
There's nothing I can do tonight,
I'll find him in the morning.
- If he turns up, you'll tell me.
- Father?
You'd better take his clothes.
His clothes?
He was in bed?
Yes.
You left his bed and went to...
Rose.
Oh, Rose.
Come on, this isn't a picnic.
SOLDIER: All right, Corp, but
there's nothing here.
He's got something there, sir.
Padre.
Good morning, padre.
I'm sorry, but what is it
you have there, please?
A man's clothes.
I see.
- And where are you taking them, Father?
- To the man.
Come on, padre.
I don't suppose you mean any harm...
but after the other day,
we've got to be careful. What man?
A man whose wife went off two nights
back with her fancy fellow.
And a man I've been looking for
since dawn today.
- A man--
- Excuse me, sir.
A man who must be half out of his mind
to have gone off as he did, barefoot.
That's right. Charles Shaughnessy.
I think we're finished here, sir.
Very well.
[Whistles]
- Hello, Charles.
- Hello, Father.
I've brought your clothes.
Thanks, Father.
I was wondering how I should get home.
- And something to drink.
- Thanks.
- Yourself?
- Aye, I will.
- You seem all right, man.
- Aye, more or less.
Well, I'll get dressed now.
Michael.
He'll be after catching a few flounders.
So, what have you been doing
down here, Charles?
Oh, thinking.
About Rosy?
About myself, mostly.
Thanks for the clothes.
You're a man in a million, Father Hugh.
The children haven't come today, then?
No.
Rose, I have something to say to you.
Come in.
Sit down, will you?
Rose, I thought I could stand by
and let you two burn it out, like I said.
But I find I can't.
I'm not sure I ought to have tried,
but anyway, I can't.
So I'm going to leave you.
- Very well.
- Sit still a minute, Rose.
What about you? You and him?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
It's over.
Was that because
I went and stayed away?
No.
It's over.
- Have you told him?
- No.
He doesn't know, then?
Yes, he knows.
How?
He must.
You're as close as that, are you?
We were, yes.
CHARLES: Rose, you must
tell me the truth.
Do you think
you're ever gonna forget him?
Of course not.
He'd be like a ghost about the place.
Rose, am I right?
Yes, you're right.
It's busted, Charles.
I busted it.
Now, have you thought what to do?
- No.
- Well, I have.
I don't think either of us can stay
in this village any longer.
No.
It's time I moved on anyway.
And you were never worse suited here.
I've reckoned up,
I've got about 200 pounds.
Take all this, without the gramophone,
fetch another 50.
We'll split it down the middle.
I can't do it.
We're not enemies, Rose.
McCARDLE: Stop that! There's
to be none of that.
But why must it be Rosy?
Because she was fornicating
with the fellow.
[Door opening]
So, you're back, are you?
What is this? What do you want?
- Not you.
- Well, then get out.
- Go on, get out.
- Shut up, Shaughnessy.
MAN: We're waiting for her.
You.
You've been tried and found guilty.
You're the informer.
What?
MOUREEN: Busting at the seams
with innocence.
Joe, for God's sake, don't hurt her, Joe.
Don't hurt her.
If she was a man, Mr. Ryan, she'd be shot.
- What is this?
- Listen, numb skull.
Someone that morning
went up to the camp...
and betrayed Tim O'Leary.
McCARDLE: Now, who lives near enough?
Who had time enough?
Who would? Who did?
That bitch you call your wife.
MAN: String her up!
But anyone could have, if anyone did.
The whole village was abroad.
No. The village was down on the beach.
- Except you.
- You came late.
- We came together. We spoke to no one.
- You'd say that, of course.
Young Kathy was with us.
Young Kathy would say black was white
if you told her.
Then anyone, anyone at all
could've gone into the police station...
- and used the telephone.
- That's where you're wrong.
They couldn't. Could they, Tom?
RYAN: No.
CHARLES: Why not?
McCARDLE: Because Tom went in
there himself and cut the wire.
Didn't you, Tom?
Well, you went in there yourself,
didn't you?
- Yes.
- And you cut the wire, didn't you?
Yes.
MRS. McCARDLE: Well, what do you
say now?
Nothing.
Take her out.
No, you're taking her nowhere.
Stop it!
- Informer.
- There she is!
Hold him.
Take him by the hands.
Quiet! Get back!
Get back!
Do it.
Princess...
What is it?
There she is.
Look here, Father Hugh,
the stripping of her was an accident.
Steady, Joe.
You're taking advantage of your cloth,
Father Hugh.
- That's what it's for.
- Come on, Joe.
McCARDLE: It's not right.
A priest is only a man.
Go on.
Go on, Michael, get off.
Get off out of it!
Hello.
Keep it.
What?
They really thought...
I was the one who betrayed that man.
Rose...
I don't for one moment suppose
that anyone betrayed him.
Why should they? They just...
They just wanted it so, that's all.
And they wanted it to be you, too.
For other reasons.
Truth was told, they envy you.
They always have.
They've always had a rare,
old contempt for me, too.
I tell you, I'm not for letting any of that lot
know we've busted up.
We'll just keep up a front
until I'm well and out of it.
What?
I don't know.
It just seemed funny, that's all.
Michael, give that to me.
All right, keep it.
I thought we were friends.
That one, too. Give it to me.
No! Look.
For Christ's sake, man,
I'm not going to hurt you.
[Loud blast]
- It'll be the soldiers.
- Soldiers?
Aye.
The beach was fairly littered with stuff.
They'll be destroying it.
Oh, yes.
[Soldiers whistling]
CORPORAL: Come on, lads,
pick them up.
SOLDIER: What about
my blisters, Corporal?
- Well, they're not mourning long.
- No.
Does she think
he killed himself deliberate?
She says...
I think he was a man who suffered,
Father Hugh.
You love her sorely, don't you, Charles?
Yes.
- Ready, then?
- Yes.
It's not all your doing, Rosy.
I should not have married you.
No.
You can tell Father Hugh
that we're parting if you like.
No.
- Rosy.
- Father.
It'll be a fair day for the journey, yet,
I think.
I hope so, yes.
Well, now, how shall we manage?
WOMAN: Margaret.
Come here, Margaret.
Come here.
[Doors slamming]
KATHY'S MOTHER: Kathy, come in.
KATHY'S FATHER: Kathy, will I take
the belt to you?
Take my arm.
A rousing sendoff.
We'll be out of it in five minutes.
Dad.
Goodbye, Dad.
Bye, princess.
I'm all right.
- Are you, darling?
- Aye.
I'm looking forward to Dublin and that.
Really.
That's your mother speaking.
- Do you remember your mother, Rose?
- A bit.
Do you, like...
- remember the rows?
- Aye.
- I never raised a fist to her, Rose.
- I know that, Dad.
You wouldn't hurt a fly if you could help it.
- I'll write to you.
- And I'll write to you.
- Well, maybe.
- No. I swear to God, Rose.
- I will write every... Every--
- All right, Dad.
We'll both write regular.
Bye-bye.
Well, wait a minute,
I must say goodbye to your husband.
You know, Rose...
when you married him,
I thought you could have done a lot better.
Now I'm not so sure
they come much better.
Would you tell him that?
It's not a thing one fellow
can easily say to another.
Shaughnessy.
Mike.
Goodbye, Shaughnessy.
Goodbye, Mr. Ryan.
Are you all right for money, you two?
I have a bit by me.
We're fine for money, Dad.
Thanks. Goodbye.
Good luck.
[Door slamming]
[Crowd whistling]
WOMAN 1: Get out and don't come back!
WOMAN 2: Get out!
Informer.
[Michael blowing horn]
CHARLES: Bus will be here in a minute.
It's brightened for you, like I said.
Aye.
Grand day for a journey.
Sign of good luck.
Thanks.
Bus is coming.
You won't have an address in Dublin yet,
I suppose.
No, Father, we...
I've wrote down here the name
and address of a decent woman...
who'll ask six shillings a week
for a dry room and a clean bed.
Six shillings, the pair of you.
You'll not do better than that,
not in Dublin.
No, I don't suppose so.
Thanks, Father.
Bye, Michael.
I have a parting gift for you here, Rose.
It's supposed to be a fragment
of St. Patrick's staff.
I don't suppose it is, though.
God bless you, child.
Come on, now. Come on, get on up.
I'll help you load up.
Thanks, Father.
Thanks for a great many things.
Charles?
I think you have it in your mind
that you and Rosy ought to part.
Yes, I thought as much.
Well, maybe you're right,
maybe you ought, but I doubt it.
And that's my parting gift to you.
That doubt.
God bless.
I don't know.
I don't know at all. Come on, Michael.

Then my mama died...

Dear God, he act like

She's scared.
But I say, "I'll take care of you,

I can't let you have Nettie.
She too young.
But l tell you what.
I can let you have CeIie.

She's spoiled, twice.
Celie is ugly but she works hard,
and she can Iearn.
And God fixed her.
You can do what you like.
She won't make you feed or clothe it.
But Nettie, you flat out can't have.
Not now, not never.
Well, I ain't never Iooked

Let me see her again.
Celie, Mister want another look at you.

Turn around.
What you doing that for?
Your sister's thinking about marriage.
How come y'all standing

Come here. Come here.
Harpo! Don't you run from me, boy!

I laid there thinking about Nettie
while he on top of me.

Then I think about
that pretty woman in the picture.
I know what he doing to me,
he done to her.
And maybe she like it.
Jesus!
Harpo, didn't I tell you
to clean my saddle?
I did do it, Pa.
Look at the mold on the side.
Look at the dirt on it.
This don't look like it's cIean.
The new mule had it on. Joey, had it.
I couldn't get it from him.
-He was biting and kicking on it.
-Ow! Ow! Ow!
When's the last time
their hair was combed?
Not since their mammy did it.
Go clean my saddle.
I'll have to shave it off.
No, no, no.
It's bad Iuck to cut a woman's hair.
This'll take all day.
Shut up!
-I can't. It hurts her.
-Ow! Ow! Ow!
-Ahh!
Don't talk back to me.
You do what I tell you.

Hush now!
Don't let them run over you.
Show them who's got the upper hand.
They got it.

All I know how to do is stay alive.
You sure look pretty today, Nettie.
Celie, my boy be needing his supper.

...and such soft, beautiful hair.
And you smell so good

Celie! My boy wants supper. The kitchen

My shirt needs mending. My pants
need fixing. My shoes need shining.
My children need feeding.
And when you're tired...
...l'm gonna climb on top of you
and do my business...
...before you can say, "Amen."
You're gonna have to leave
here soon...
...before he make his move on you.
No.
What would I do if l couldn't talk to you?
We could write.
Can you read good?
-I can't say that l do.
I'll go to school for both of us.
We'Il both learn real hard

Ain't you got nothing better to do?
"For the next eight or ten months...
...Oliver was the vicient--
victim of a sesum"...
Systematic.
What's "systematic" mean?
It be like when you have a way
of doing stuff the same way all the time.
Like how we hang the sheets
first so we can put the socks in the cracks.
Now us never be apart.
Ahh!
Me and you
Us never part

Me and you, us have one heart

Ain't no ocean, ain't no sea

Good morning
I got to go to school.
What you doing?
No! Please!
Please, please, please!

Whoa. Whoa. Whoop, whoop.
Ahh!

Shug! Shug, l'm coming!
-Harpo, saddle my horse!

Is there a Ietter from Nettie?
Ain't nothing for you.

-Harpo! Ain't you saddled that horse yet?
-Yes, sir!

"For the next eight...
...or ten...
...months...
...Oliver was the victim of a...
...systematic...
...course of treachery.
For the next eight
or ten months...
...Oliver was the victim
of a systematic course...
...of treachery and deception."
He was brought up by hand.
The hungry and destitute situation
of the infant orphan was duly"--
Celie!
Come help me get ready!
Come on! I'll be late!
You hear me call you?
-Yes, sir?
Celie, ain't that good comb...
...with my other brushes?
Harpo, ain't that horse saddled?
Yes, sir, Pa. Yes, sir.
I's getting to it. I's getting to it.
Georgie!
Too much grease.
Celie!
I don't use this kind of grease!
This grease for slopping hogs!
It ain't for no hair!
You gonna make me late!
I'm gonna get you if you make me late!
Where's my other bIack sock?
Where's my other bIack sock?
Oh, no! Oh!
-CeIie, don't forget to iron my shirt.
-Yes, sir.
Where's my black tie?
I mean the yellow one with black in it!
It's in there.
I don't see it!
Where's my suit pin?
-In the drawer.
-Is it on the shelf?
Uh-huh.
Is it the right side or the left side?
The left side?
The left.
Is this the right vest for my suit?
Shit.
Where's my blue--
Oh, here it is.
Which one?
The black one or the blue one?
I like the black one.
Oh, no.
I hate this tie!
It don't go with nothing I got on!
I had a blue one....
Damn!
Hyah! Come on, come on. Hyah!
She said she write,
but she never write.
She said only death
could keep her from me.
Maybe she dead.
Sofia, slow down!
Sofia, now slow down!
Harpo, I declare,
you is slow today!
Dear God,
Harpo be in love with a girl called Sofia.
Now, she be a big girl.
Mister say he want to have a look at her.
I seen them coming way up the road.
They just be marching,
like going to war.
Pop, this here is Sofia.
Sofia is a pretty name, huh?
Sofia, Sofia, Sofia!
-Harpo.
-Us gonna get married.
Looks like you got yourself in trouble.
I ain't in no trouble.
Big, though.
Who the daddy?
Harpo.
How does he know that?
He knows because he the only one!
Celie, get me some lemonade.
Young women no good these days.
Got their legs open for every Tom,
Dick and Harpo.
Don't think I'll let my boy marry you
just because you in the family way.
Ain't cold enough.
He young and limited. Pretty gal Iike you
could put anything over on him.
Why I need to marry Harpo?
He living here with you.
What food and cIothes he get,
you buy.
I know your daddy throwed you out.
Ready to live in the street.
No, sir, l ain't living in no streets.
I'm living with my sister
and her husband.
I can live with them
the rest of my life if I want to.
I don't need you to tell me how
to take care of me and my baby.
I can take care of my baby myself.
Nice visiting.
No, you stay right here, Harpo.
When you free,
me and the baby be waiting.
Well, look like somebody around here
know how to treat a visitor.
Harpo, don't you move one step.
Just don't make me wait too long, Harpo.
Harpo?
Harpo!
I won't! I will! I wiIl! I do.
I do!
I do.
Now, Sofia.
Do you take this man to be your
lawful wedded husband?
To love, honor and cherish?
Forsaking all others for him alone...
...you will perform unto him
all duties owes to a husband...
...untiI death shaIl separate you?
I do!
You may now salute the bride.
Amen!
I's married now!
I's a married woman!
I declare....
Come on, push now. Push now.
I been needing so many curtains,
but I ain't had time.
You children, get out of this yard.
Go on home!
Harpo, come on down here.
I need you to hold this baby.
I'm busy!
Busy making a racket.
Now come on down here!
Damn, Sofia! I'll come down
when I'm good and ready!
I teIl you the truth! It is!
Child, we're going to get you
a littIe milk.
A little milk for the baby.
Yes, indeed.
Here. Go to your daddy.
What should I do with it?
Try feeding her, then fix up the mess
you done made here.
I can smell the rain coming.
Miss Celie, we got ourselves some
new curtains I want to put in the bedroom.
The living room
has already got itself some flowers.
What you looking at?
It's gonna rain on your head!
You ever hit her?
No, sir.
How you expect her to mind?
Heh, heh.
Wives is like children.
You have to let them know
who got the upper hand.
Nothing can do it better
than a good beating.
Sofia thinks too much of herself.
Needs to be taken down a peg or two.
Got a new baby
and it cry all night long.
Kept him up so he said
he wasn't going to work.
She got all upset but l said,
"Leave the man alone.
Sometimes a man just needs
to be left alone."
I need something to eat!
Pie's in the pantry. Women need
to be left alone sometimes.
I teIl Harpo when I'm fussing,
"Leave me aIone!"
Ain't you gonna get it for me?
-What's the matter with you?
That's my own baby crying. Lord.
Make yourself useful, Harpo.
Hush now, honey.
What am I gonna do about Sofia?
Beat her.
You told Harpo to beat me!
It was that mule, Old Joey.
Old Joey, the mule.
I was plowing the north field
and the mule went crazy.
He started kicking.
Busted my eye and my lip.
All my life I had to fight.
I had to fight my daddy,
I had to fight my uncles.
I had to fight my brothers.
Girl chiId ain't safe in a family of mens.
But l never thought I had to fight
in my own house!
I loves Harpo.
God knows I do.
But l'll kilI him dead
before I let him beat me!
-That's a hoof print.
-No, that look like a fist print.
No, sir. Ain't no fist touched my face.
No, sir.
You want a dead son-in-law, Miss Celie?
You keep on advising him
like you doing.
This life be over soon.
Heaven lasts always.
You shouId bash Mister's head open
and think about Heaven later.
Sofia beat on Harpo.
Then Harpo beat on Sofia.
And then Sofia beat on Harpo
some more.
In between the beatings,
the children keep coming.
And then one day,
Sofia can't take it no more.
And good riddance!
Bye, CIarence!
Bye, Emma! Bye, Ruby!
Bye, Sofia! Bye!
Nettie.
Morning, Mr. HuntIey!
-Whoa.
Morning, Mr. Johnson.
I brung you some fresh-baked cookies
made in my stove!
-Thank you. They look good.
-Bring the plate back tomorrow.
Now giddyup! Giddyup!
Have a fine day, Mr. Huntley!
And keep the plate!
Anything come for me?
Dear God, today was a peculiar day.
I was sitting on the porch
reading to the kids...
...when all of a sudden,
something struck me.
I got up and looked at the sky.
It was dark
and there wasn't nothing moving.
I got down off the porch to see what
was coming. It felt like twister weather.
I didn't see nothing.
But I know something's there.
Yes, indeed, Lord.
I know something's coming.
Pa! Who that, Pa? Who this?
Pa, who this?
The woman that shouId have been
your mammy.
Shug Avery?
Give me a hand and get her in the house.
Celie! Help me get her in the house.
Celie! Damn it! Get here!
Celie!
Hey, Celie! Get here!
Celie, this Shug Avery, a friend
of the family. Fix up the spare room.
I can't move.
I can't move. l need to see her eyes.
I feel that once l see her eyes,
my feet can let go...
...of where they're stuck.
You sure is ugly!
Come on, now.
Turn loose my goddamn hand!
What's the matter with you? You crazy?
I don't need no weak Iittle boy...
...can't say no to his daddy,
hanging on me!
I need me a man! You hear?
A man!
And I don't want to smeIl
no goddamn stinking pipe, Albert!
Get that thing to make me
something to eat.
No, no. I'll make it myself.
Albert?
Ahh! Shit!
Eggs. SkiIlet.
Why you put the pots up here?
Nobody can get to them.
Butter, butter, butter.
It's in the cooler, on the shelf.
-Butter? Butter!
-Huh?
In the cooler, on the shelf.
Albert.
Ain't warm enough.
How do you work this stove?
Ain't hot enough.
Can't even keep a stove
burning good all day.
Can't even keep a oven hot!
You're useless sometimes!
Wood. Wood. Wood. Wood.
Ah.
Did you ever cook here?
It stiIl ain't hot enough!
I'll get it hot.
I'll show you how to make it hot.
Yeah.
Mm-mm!
Baby, look what l brought you.
Mm!
Baby, have I got a surprise for you.
This'll make you all well.
This got burnt, but the eggs
are just the way you like them.
Are you trying to kill me?
No. Now, baby, don't be that way!
I toId you, I don't want nothing!
I just stand back and wait to see
what the wall gonna look like.
See what kind of colors
Shug's gonna put on there now.
What you staring at?
Never seen a naked woman before?
You got any children?
Yes, ma'am.
"Yes, ma'am"? l ain't that old.
Two.
Where they at?
I don't know.
Who are you?
Celie, ma'am.
You ain't well.
Mind your own goddamn business.
I feel just fine. Just had to eat.
Now, put some more bubbling oil
in this tub.
You got kids?
Yeah.
They with my ma and pa.
Never knowed a child to come out right
unless there's a man around.
Children...
...got to have a pa.
Your pa love you?
My pa loved me.
My pa still loves me...
...except he don't know it.
He don't know it.
Hey, boy! Here, boy!
Nobody here to greet your pa?
Sure ain't nobody in the fields,
that's for sure.
Just couldn't rest till you got her
in your house, couId you?
Cool drink?
Take your hat?
What is it with this Shug Avery?
She black as tar...
...nappy-headed....
She got Iegs like baseball bats.
Her own daddy won't have
nothing to do with her.
Old Mister talking trash about Shug.
Folks don't like nobody
being too proud or too free.
She's no more than a jook-joint Jezebel.
She ain't even clean.
I hear she's got that
nasty women's disease.
You ain't got it in you to understand.
I love Shug Avery.
Always have, always will.
Should've married her when
I had a chance.
Yeah.
And throwed your life away. And a right
smart amount of money with it.
Plus, I hear all her children's
got different daddies.
It's all too trifling and confused.
All Shug's children got the same daddy.
I can vouch--
You can vouch for nothing!
Shug Avery done set the population
of Hartwell County a new high.
You just one of the roosters, boy.
Celie.
You has my sympathy.
Ain't many women's allow their
husband's whore to lay up in their house.
Celie.
Hand Pa his hat.
Next time, l'll put
a little Shug Avery pee in his glass...
...and see how he like that.
I ain't heard so much racket
since before Sofia left.
Every evening after he leave the field...
...he knocking down
and piling things up.
Sometime his friend Swain
come by to help.
Hey, Harpo!
Swain! Ahh!
Two ofthem worked
long way past supper.
Mister have to call and tell them
to shut up the racket.
What you doing?
BuiIding a jook joint.
Way back here?
-Yeah!
Jook joint's supposed to be
way back in the woods.
You never seen this before.
-Now you close your eyes.
-Keep your eyes cIosed.
I know what a cow looks like.
You ain't never seen
a cow like this.
Yeah. Come on now! Come on.
Ready. One, two, three!
Ha, ha!
Look at that! Look at that!
Hey, welcome to Harpo's! I'm Harpo.
Yonder go yourpapa
Running down a field
Slipping and a sliding
Like an automobile
I hollered at Papa
And told him to wait
Slipped away from me
Like a Cadillac snake
'Cause he's the rottenest cheater
Girl, I'd drink your bath water!
Oh, sugar dumpling,
let me taste some! Aw, baby!
You can catch a fish
without a hook, girl.
I like your uncle,
Like your brother too
I did like your pappy
But your pappy wouldn't do
I met your daddy
On the corner the other day
You know about that
That he was funny that way
Now he's a funny mistreater,
A robber and a cheater
Slip you in the dozens
Your pappy's, your cousin
And your mama do the Lordy, Lord
Now God made him an elephant
Made him stout
Wasn't satisfied till he made him a snout
Looks like Albert brought his maid.
Last time I saw that kind of hat
was at my mama's funeral.
Wasn't satisfied until
He made him some eyes
Made him some eyes
Just to lose on the ground
Wasn't satisfied till he made his yes, yes
Made his yes, yes, yes
Whoo!
Wasn't satisfied till he made him sick
Made him sick, Lord
It made him well
You know about that
The elephant caught hell
'Cause he's a dirty mistreater
A robber and a cheater
Slip you in your dozens
Your papa's, your cousin
Mama, do the Lordy, Lord
Oh, Lordy, Lord!
There's only two kinds
of children in this world.
God's children and Satan's chiIdren.
Babylon ain't no far-off pIace
in the desert.
It's right here! Just a few hundred yards
from this holy pIace.
Whoo.
The song I'm about to sing...
...is called "Miss Celie's Blues."
Because she scratched it
out of my head when I was aiIing.
Sister, you've been on my mind
Oh, sister, we're two of a kind
So sister
I'm keeping my eyes on you
I bet you think I don't know nothing
But singing the blues
Oh, sister, have I got news for you
I'm something
I hope you think
That you're something too
Oh, scuffling
I been up that lonesome road
And I seen a lot of suns going down
Oh, but trust me
No low life's gonna run me around
So let me tell you something, sister
Remember your name
No twister,
Gonna steal your stuff away
My sister
We sure ain't got a whole lot of time
So shake your shimmy, sister
Because honey this Shug
Is feeling fine
I know you don't beIieve it,
but I used to live here.
This used to be my living room.
That was my kitchen.
Harpo run the doors and windows
from the creek to here.
Now, somewhere is my dining room.
Lord, look at who's here. It's Miss Celie.
Miss Celie, it sure is good to see you.
PulI up a chair. Have a coId drink.
I believes I want me
some of this here.
I want to introduce y'all to my friend.
Henry Broadnax is his name.
Everybody call him Buster.
He's a good friend of the family.
How you doing? How you feel?
-Where are your children?
-At home. Where are yours?
Lord have mercy!
-Hey, Harpo.
Oh, Lord!
What you doing here?
I come to hear Miss Shug sing
and to see what a nice place you built.
This is scandalous!
A woman with children in a jook joint!
A woman need to have
a littIe fun, Harpo.
-A woman need to be at home.
-Hey, I don't fight my woman's battles.
My job is to love her
and take her where she want to go. Right?
That sure is, Buster.
Right, honey. You got it.
Let's dance.
First time l ever been knocked down
without throwing a punch.
Be nice now.
-Be nice now.
-Ha, ha, ha. Yeah.
Harpo!
Who this woman?
You know who this is.
She best leave you alone.
Fine with me.
You ain't going nowhere.
This is my jook joint.
You said it's our jook joint!
Can't a man dance with his wife?
Not if she left him.
Good night, y'all.
And not if he my man.
You just a big old heifer! Ha, ha, ha.
Like I said, fine with me.
Ohh.
Whoop. Time to go.
Ohh.
-Sweetpea!
Hold on there! Hold on.
-Oh, shit!
-This is my place! Come on.
Get off my boy!
What about me?
Come on, I don't want to have
to come in after you.
Lord, have mercy! Firemen ain't
gonna get it, somebody call the Iaw!
You can light a fire without a match.
You can catch a fish without a hook.
You can make a blind man see.
Oh!
Now do your shimmy.
Shake your shimmy, girl!
Come on! Show me your stuff!
Oh, Celie.
Miss Celie, why you always
covering up your smile?
Show me some teeth.
Show me that pretty smile.
Oh, girl, you need
a smiling lesson.
Made him stout
Wasn't satisfied till I made him a snout
Made him a snout
Just as long as a rail
Wasn't satisfied
Till I made him a tail
Made him a tail
Just a--
You see, Miss Celie,
you gots a beautifuI smile.
Well, Miss CeIie,
I do believe it's time for me to go.
September. Yeah, September be
a good time to go off in the world.
What's the matter?
He beat me when you ain't here.
Who do?
Albert?
Mister.
Why he do that?
He beat me for not being you.
I know he a bully...
...but there's some things
I love about him.
You still love him?
I got what you call a passion for him.
If l was ever going to have a husband,
he'd been it. But he weak.
Tell me the truth.
Do you mind if Albert sleep with me?
You Iike sleeping with him?
I have to confess, I love it. Don't you?
No.
No, most time I pretend l ain't even there.
He don't know the difference.
He don't never ask me how l feel.
He never ask me about myself.
He just cIimb on top of me
and do his business.
"Do his business"?
You sound like he going
to the toilet on you.
That's what it feel like.
Then, Miss Celie...
...that mean you still a virgin.
-Yeah, because don't nobody love me.
-I love you.
-You think I's ugly.
-No, I don't.
You ugly. You sure is ugly.
You still ugly.
Amen.
Oh, Miss Celie,
that was just the salt and sugar.
Me being jealous of you and Albert.
I think you beautiful.
Shug like honey...
...and now, l's just like a bee.
I's follow her everywhere,
want to go where she go.
What life like for her?
And why she sometime get so sad?
So sad, just like me.
Tell her something
Hello.
How you been?
I been sick. Maybe you heard.
But l feels better now.
I been staying with Albert and Celie.
They been taking care of me.
Place bring back memories.
I used to stand right over there
watching you.
Best preacher in the world.
The way you'd make your voice
rise and fall when you turned a phrase.
The way you looked in your blue suit.
Girls cutting their eyes at you.
Oh, it's something to see.
You'd smile at us and say:
"Ladies...
...'God Is Trying To Tell You Something',
if you please."
And we sang.
We sang our hearts out.
I couldn't sleep at night
And I was wondering why
It's all right.
I know you can't say nothing to me
anymore because things are so different.
Just thought I'd stop and say hello.
Shug say she going back
to Memphis.
I'm gonna go with her. This is my
only chance to break from Mr. Jail.
What you doing?
Nothing.
It don't look like that to me.
Albert!
I need you to sit on my suitcase.
Albert!
-Good luck, baby.
Aww. Ha, ha.
Right, see you.
Right.
Oh, yeah.
On your way.
There something you got to say?
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
Don't be scared. Say it, girl.
I's going to miss you.
I's going to miss you too.
I'm going to miss you too.
Come on! Let's go! Ha, ha!
Hey, Shug! Write!
Do good in Chicago, Shug!
Oh, shit.
Honey, let me see you.
Look at you, you're so sweet.
Millie, let's leave them folks alone.
Look! Aren't they cute?
-Good afternoon, Mr. Mayor.
-Good to see you.
How are you today?
Look at that! That's the cutest little face
I ever saw. Give me some sugar.
You are so sweet.
Say thank you now.
Millie, always going on over the coIored.
Your children are so clean.
Would you Iike to work for me?
Be my maid?
Hell no.
What did you say?
Hell no.
What did she say?
Can't you pump that a little faster?
Gal, what did you say to Miss Millie?
I said, "Hell"--
No, Miss Sofia!
No, Miss Sofia! No!
I can't believe you did that!
Get my children out of here!
Take them home!
Get my children out of here!
Who do you think you are?
Don't touch me! Leave me alone!
Don't touch me!
Who do you think you are?
You fat nigger!
God, dear God! Sheriff, help me!
Howdy, mayor.
Howdy.
-How are you?
-Fine, thank you.
-How's the missus?
-She's doing real well.
Let's see what we have here.
Ohh! I'm driving!
I'm driving.
Hey! Watch it!
Look, I'm driving!
Whoo! Isn't that fun?
Dear God, after many years,
they let Sofia out of jail...
...just to put her in the next.
She ended up being
Miss Millie's maid after all.
Mayor bought Miss Millie a car,
and she had Sofia teach her how to drive.
Poor Sofia, stuck with Miss Millie
for the rest of her life.
-We went past the store.
-Top the H.
I've got it. Top of the H.
Here we go.
Oh, my. That was exciting, wasn't it?
Yes, ma'am, I reckon it was.
Well, let's do the shopping!
Sofia, l need apples, raisins,
cinnamon, currants, lemons...
...crackers, brown sugar, oranges,
nutmeg, flour, salt, pepper...
...cloves, eggs, and some candy
for the children.
How are you today?
Nice to see you!
-Have a nice Christmas.
Same to you.
I've been wondering about
starting a fund for the colored children.
It's a little late this year.
I meant to talk
to some of the shopkeepers about it.
We could do one next year.
Set up a fund so they could have some toys
and some clothes, a toy or two.
I started taking driving lessons.
Did you see me out there?
-Sofia's been teaching me how to drive.
-That's wonderful.
Have you ever thought
about going to Mars?
I wonder what it's like.
They call it the red planet.
Does it look red?
How are you doing today?
-Good to see you. HelIo.
How do, Mr. Peters?
Look at me, I'm driving.
Yes, ma'am.
Sofia, l'm gonna drive you
home tomorrow.
Did you hear what I said?
I'm gonna drive you home.
-Home?
-Yes, home.
You haven't seen your children
in a while.
No, I ain't seen them
in about eight years.
That's a shame.
Tomorrow's Christmas!
You can stay all day!
You can stay all day!
I wilI drive myself back.
Thank you.
That's your mama.
That's her.
Go on.
Hi, my name is Emma.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
Sofia back!
-Sofia, I'll pick you up at 5:00.
-Yes, ma'am.
Come on.
Oh, Miss Sofia,
it's so good to have you home.
Oh, yes.
So good.
Mama, why are you crying?
Because I don't know y'aIl no more.
This is going to be
a happy Christmas!
I can do it.
I can put it in reverse.
I can make it go the right way.
Come on. Ohh!
She can't get it out of reverse.
Mrs. Millie! Whoa, whoa!
Take off your coat.
Get away from me!
You get away from me!
Don't touch me!
-Don't you know who I am?
Yes, ma'am.
-I've always been good to you people!
-We know that, ma'am.
Calm down.
-I am Miss Millie! I'm the mayor's wife!
Yes, ma'am.
I've always been good to you people!
I've always gone out of my way
for coloreds!
Yes, ma'am.
Miss Millie, what's the matter?
Those boys....
Those boys tried to attack me.
No such a thing.
How could you leave me alone
for so Iong?
Come on now. Come on.
What am l gonna do
about the car?
Jack will drive you home,
Miss Millie.
I can't ride in a car
with some strange coIored man.
I'll ask my sister Odessa to squeeze in.
That way I have more time
with my children.
I don't know her either.
Goodbye!
It's Shug.
-Shug.
-Heh. Hot diggidy-dog!
I'm coming, Shug!
-It's sugarbaby!
Hey, Shug!
Hey, Shug!
Albert!
Hey, Shug--
Oh! Miss Celie!
I've heard so much about you!
Feels like we old friends!
This is Grady.
This is my husband.
Us been driving all night.
No place to stop. But here us is!
Well, how are you?
We're fine.
Got colds though.
This here's my wedding present.
Brand new.
I want Albert to learn how to drive it.
Grady drive like a fool.
I thought the police would get us.
Us two married Iadies now.
Two married ladies, and hungry!
What us got to eat?
Yeah, you know, Grady,
we done had the best.
It's true.
-Yeah, we done had the best.
You had her your way. I had her mine.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
But we had her!
We had her!
Let's us drink to having some Shug.
I'll get my mail. I'm expecting
an agreement from Memphis.
You ought to wait for Mister.
If l was to wait for AIbert,
I'd wait till Christmas.
I's married now!
I said l's married now.
Well, let's toast it at somebody.
All the evil, and all the love.
I like you, boy!
I like you too!
Come upstairs with me.
I got to finish stuffing the turkey.
You're my kind of man!
"April 18...
...1935.
Dear Celie:
I know you think l'm dead...
...but l am not.
I've been writing to you over the years...
...but Albert said
you'd never hear from me again...
...and since I never heard from you
all this time...
...l guess he was right.
Now I only write
at Christmas and Easter...
...hoping my letters get lost among
the Christmas and Easter greetings...
...or that Albert get the holiday spirit
and have pity on us."
"There is so much to tell you...
...l hardly know where to begin.
And anyway,
you probably won't get this letter either.
I am sure Albert is still the only one...
...to take the mail out of the box.
But if this does not get to him...
...one thing I want you to know"....
"I Iove you...
...and I'm not dead.
I love you and l'm not dead.
"The lady you met in town
is named Corrine.
Her husband's named Samuel.
Sanctified, religious
and very good to me.
Their only sorrow in the beginning was...
...that they could not have children.
And then they say"....
"Then they say...
...God sent them Olivia...
...and Adam.
Yes, their children sent by God
are your children.
And they have been brought up in love.
And now God has sent me
to watch over them...
...to protect and cherish them...
...to lavish all the love
I feel for you on them.
It's a miracle, isn't it?
And no doubt impossible
for you to believe.
Olivia and Adam are with me...
...aIl growing up together...
...a family.
Your loving sister, Nettie."
I got two children...
...and they's alive.
Hear that, Miss Shug?
Olivia and Adam.
And they's alive.
I love her as much as you,
probably more.
I's getting real tired of this cat.
He coming back soon.
You crazy? He in the jook joint.
This doesn't look nothing Iike me.
Damn him.
"Celie."
There's so many of them.
What us gonna do?
Go to my room and put them in order
by the postmark.
"Dear Celie, the reason why
I am in Africa is because...
...one of the missionaries that was
supposed to go with Corrine and Samuel...
...to heIp with the children
and setting up the school...
...suddenly married a man,
and l came in her place."
I wrote a letter to you
almost every day on the ship.
On my first sight of the Africa coast...
...something struck in me, in my soul,
Celie, like a large bell.
I just vibrated.
It has been a long time
since I had time to write, but always...
...no matter what I'm doing,
I'm writing you. Dear--
Celie! Bring me a cool drink.
Olinka is four days march
through the bush from the harbor.
Do you know what a jungle is?
Trees and trees and then more trees
on top of that.
And big!
They are so big,
they look like they were built.
And vines and ferns
and animals and noises...
...that make you wonder
what is lurking behind the shadows...
...of every bush.
We're up at 5:00 for a breakfast of
millet, porridge, fruit, then morning classes.
We teach the children English,
reading, writing...
...history, geography, arithmetic,
and the stories of the Bible.
The older children are used
to coming to the mission school.
The smaller ones are not.
Their mothers sometimes drag them here
screaming and kicking.
They're all boys. Olivia's the only girl.
There is a little African girl
called Tashi.
She plays with Olivia after school.
"Why can't Tashi come to school?"
she asks me.
I told her the Olinka don't believe
in educating girls.
She said, quick as a flash:
"Like white people at home
who don't want black people to learn."
She is sharp, Celie.
When Tashi can get away
from her chores her mother assigns her...
...she and Olivia hide in my hut.
To Olivia right now,
Tashi alone is Africa.
Everything she learns,
she shares with Tashi. Sound familiar?
At first, there was the faintest
sound of movement in the forest.
A kind of low humming. Then there was
chopping and the sound of dragging.
Then the scent.
Some days there's smoke.
Now, after two months during which
I or the children...
...or Corrine has been sick...
...all we hear is chopping
and scraping and dragging.
And every day we smell smoke.
Today a boy in my afternoon class
burst out as he entered:
"The road approaches!"
If you live right Heaven belongs to you
If you live right Heaven belongs to you
Dear Celie,
the white man is building a road.
It finally reached the cassava fields
nine months ago.
The morning after the road was done,
as far as Olinka was concerned...
...what should we discover,
but that the road builders were back.
They have instructions to continue
the road for another 30 miles...
...and continue it on its present course
right through the village of Olinka.
The road builders didn't deviate
an inch from the head man's plan.
Every hut that lay in the road's path
was leveled.
Celie, our church, our school...
...my hut...
...all went down in a matter of hours.
But the worst is yet to be told.
Sweet Corrine died from fever and grief.
We buried her in the Olinka way.
But, Celie, my dear, sweet sister...
...we'll all be coming home once we work
something out with U.S. lmmigration.
They don't know if we're American,
African, or missionary.
Just pray for us, Celie.
Watch for me in the sunset.
What's with you?
I was calIing you for an hour!
Now get my shave
and don't keep me waiting!
Left, right! Left, right! Left, right!
-Where's Celie?
Home fixing to shave Mister.
You got a fever? I didn't come here
for you to take all day to shave me.
Get the molasses out of your ass!
The longer I'm married to you,
the slower and dumber you get.
Your ass is as slow
as l ever seen it before.
Celie! Ain't that razor sharpened yet?
Get on out here and do me right now!
Get on out here!
All right.
No!
Put your head back.
Cut my neck and I'll get you by the ears.
That razor looks dulI to me, Miss Celie.
Damn women.
How you feeling, Miss Sofia?
Confused.
Ain't you glad to be home?
Maybe.
Grandpa, I'm full.
I'm not hungry anymore.
-Now come the time for me to tell you.
-What?
It's time for us to go.
You're such good people.
Salt of the earth.
It's time to move on.
-CeIie is coming with us.
-Say what?
Celie is coming to Memphis with us.
Over my dead body!
You satisfied? That's what you want?
Now what's wrong with you?
You a lowdown, dirty dog,
that's what's wrong.
It's time for me to get away from you
and enter Creation.
Your dead body be just the welcome mat
I need.
You can't talk to my boy that way.
Your boy.
If he hadn't been your boy,
he might have been a halfway decent man.
Say what?
You took my sister Nettie away from me.
You knew she was the only somebody
in the worId who loved me.
But Nettie and my kids
are coming home soon.
And when we all get together,
we're going to whup your ass.
Nettie and your kids?
Woman, you talking crazy.
I got children.
My children are Iiving in Africa.
Africa!
Learning different languages.
Fresh air, plenty of exercise.
They'll turn out better than these fooIs
you never tried to raise.
-HoId on, here!
-No "hold on," Harpo.
If you hadn't tried to rule over Sofia,
white folks wouldn't have got her.
That's a lie!
A Iittle truth in it.
Y'all was rotten kids.
You was. You was rotten kids!
Made my life here hell.
Your daddy ain't nothing
but some dead horseshit.
Shut up! It's bad luck for a woman
to laugh at a man!
My God, the dead has arisen.
I had enough bad luck
to keep me laughing the rest of my life.
Sat in that jail
till I near about done rot to death.
I know what it like, Miss Celie.
Want to go somewhere and can't.
I know what it like to want to sing
and have it beat out of you.
I want to thank you, Miss Celie...
...for everything you done for me.
I remember the day I was in the store
with Miss Millie.
I was feeling real down.
I was feeling mighty bad.
And when I see'd you...
...l knowed there is a God.
I knowed there is a God, and one day
I was going to get to come home.
You won't get a penny of my money.
Not one thin dime!
Did I ever ask you for anything?
Did I ever ask you for anything?
I never asked you for nothing! Not even
for your sorry-ass hand in marriage!
Nothing. I never asked you for nothing!
Old Sofia home now. Sofia home.
Things are going to change around here.
I'm going with Shug.
-You going where?
With Miss Celie and Shug.
I'm fixing to sing.
Too much racket going on in this house.
Pass me them peas.
-Listen, Squeak--
-My name ain't Squeak.
-What?
-My name is Mary Agnes.
-Mary what?
-Mary Agnes.
I thought it was Squeak.
Who gives a damn? Boy, you going
to let this nappy-haired gal sit here...
...and cuss you out?
You're at the head of your own table...
...and you acting like a waiter!
Hush, you old fool!
Always meddling in somebody's business.
Sofia home now. Just hush up!
She'll be back. Shug got talent.
She can sing.
She got spunk and can talk to anybody.
She can stand up and be noticed.
What you got?
You're ugly. You're skinny.
You're shaped funny.
You're too scared
to open your mouth to people.
-All you fit to do is be Shug's maid.
- Albert, no.
Take out her slop jar, maybe cook her food.
You ain't even that good a cook.
She's a lot better than that
first wife you married.
This house ain't been cIeaned good
since my first wife died.
Nobody's crazy enough to marry you.
So what you gonna do?
Hire yourself to farm?
Maybe somebody will let you
work on their railroad.
Maybe sweep out the caboose.
Any more letters come?
Could be. Could be not. Who's to say?
Celie, no!
I curse you! Until you do right by me...
...everything you think about
will crumble!
Don't do it. Don't trade places
with what I been through.
Come on, Miss Celie. Let's go to the car.
He ain't worth it.
Who you think you is?
You can't curse nobody. Look at you!
You're black, you're poor, you're ugIy,
you're a woman! You're nothing!
Until you do right by me,
everything you even think about gonna fail!
It's been a pleasure meeting all of you.
Goodbye.
Glad I came back just in time.
We need some stability around here,
that's for sure.
I should have locked you up!
Just let you out to work!
The jail you planned for me
is the one you gonna rot in.
Celie, get in the car. Get in the car.
Everything you done to me...
...is already done to you.
I'm poor, black.
I may even be ugly.
But dear God, I'm here!
I'm here!
Hey, you'll be back!
Ha-ha-ha!
What are you going to do?
You'll be back!
Hey, boy.
Boy, what's the matter
with you?
Hey, Pa.
This house is a wreck!
Been drinking.
You want some supper?
No, thank you.
I hear you been spending more time
at Harpo's and less in the fields.
I guess I just raised you wrong.
How's that, Pa?
How's that?
The fields are overgrown,
the animals ain't tended to...
...this house is a wreck.
And what you doing about it? Nothing.
Just sitting here drinking,
ruining your life.
My Iife's already ruined.
This house is dead.
There ain't no Shug, no chiIdren...
...no laughter and no life. Just me.
I ain't heard such nonsense in all my life.
Now listen to me.
I know just what you need.
We need you a woman.
Nice, little, young girl clean up the house,
iron your shirts--
-Bye, Pa.
-Clean up this house.
-Goodbye, Pa.
-You listen to what l say.
I ain't listening to you.
Goodbye, Pa! Bye!
Get yourself a young girI.
You heed your daddy's advice.
Get these chickens
back in the coop...
...before they Iay eggs all over the place.
It's time to go now.
Time to go home.
You know I don't want to dance.
I move good for an old man.
Come on, time to go.
Time to go now. Come on!
I got some Tennessee tobacco,
cured with whiskey.
You know I don't smoke.
Time to go!
That's right. Time to go now.
Time to go.
Time to go. Time to go.
Time to go.
Whoo!
It sure is nice...
...to see you two together again.
Maybe you ought to see him home.
He gonna be just fine.
Just fine.
Dear God, after all these years...
...the man I knew as my pa is dead.
But then, Nettie write
that my real daddy lynched.
My mama marry this dead man
two years after my real daddy dead.
My children, not my sister and brother.
Pa, not Pa.
You his wife?
Yes, ma'am.
How'd he die?
On top of me.
Well, it's all yours now.
Yeah, but I still don't understand how.
Your real daddy owned this land
and the house and the store.
He left it to your mama.
When your mama died, it passed on
to you and your sister, Nettie.
He left me the money though.
Well, if you'll excuse us,
we got a train to catch.
Ya-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha!
I ain't never figured I'd wear pants.
Not to mention the things Miss Celie made.
What you think?
Sofia, Sofia. That sure is a pretty name.
Now let me see you. How can a pair
of pants that fits Sofia fit me?
Well, Harpo,
you just going to have to try them on.
It's just like my sign say:
"One size fit all."
Go in there, try them on and you'll see.
-Sure enough?
-Sure enough. Go on, now.
Make sure you close that curtain.
I don't want you showing Emma
all your business.
He ain't changed a lick.
I got this fabric from Washington.
I wanted to make you a pair of pants.
I don't know about no....
Harpo says I spend
too much money.
Miss Celie, you is a miracle!
Ho, ho, Harpo.
Where will you wear them britches?
-Nowhere.
I know you're not! Look at you!
The more things change,
the more they stay the same.
Me and Shug, I smile.
But us still longing.
More than anything,
God love admiration.
You saying God is vain?
No, not vain.
Just wanting to share a good thing.
I think it pisses God off
if you walk by the color purple...
...in a field...
...and you don't notice it.
Are you saying it just want
to be loved like it say in the Bible?
Yeah, Celie.
Everything want to be loved.
Us sing and dance and holler...
...just trying to be loved.
Look at them trees.
Ever notice how trees do everything
to get attention that we do...
...except walk?
Oh, Miss Celie, I feels Iike singing!
Sister, you've been on my mind
Oh, sister, we're two of a kind
So, sister, I'm keeping my eyes on you
I betcha think l don't know nothing
All of us been prodigal children
one time or another!
And it's possible for the Lord
to drive you home.
And he can drive you home to truth.
He can fix it for you if you trust him.
Let's sing
"God Is Trying To TeIl You Something."
Sing "God Is Trying To Tell You Something."

No. Probably just some peopIe
lost their way.
Nettie!
Celie!
Nettie!
Hey, Nettie.
Celie!
This is your son, Adam.
Mama!
He says, "Welcome."
He says, "Greetings."
He says,
"This is the day of his dreams."
Yeah.
Celie. Come on.
This is Olivia.
Mama!
I want to know you, Mama.
My mother.
And, CeIie, Adam has a wife. Tashi.
Tashi. Come.
Tashi, this is my sister, Celie.
Me and you, us never part
Makidada
Me and you, us never part
Makidada
Ain't no ocean, ain't no sea
Makidada
$&$The hours$&$
Dearest, I feel certain
that I am going mad again.
I feel we can't go
through another
of these terrible times,
and I... shan't
recover this time.
I begin to hear voices,
and can't concentrate.
So, I am doing what seems to be
the best thing to do.
You have given me
the greatest possible happiness.
You have been in every way
all that anyone could be.
I know that I am spoiling your life,
and without me, you could work.
And you will, I know.
You see, I can't
even write this properly.
What I want to say is that I owe
all the happiness of my life to you.
You have been entirely patient
with me...
and incredibly good.
Everything's gone from
me but the certainty
of your goodness.
I can't go on
spoiling your life any longer.
I don't think two people
could have been happier
than we have been.
Virginia.
Good morning, Doctor.
Mr. Woolf.
No worse, I think.
I see.
The main thing is to keep her
where she is, and calm.
Friday, then.
Good morning, Leonard.
Good morning, Virginia.
How was your sleep?
Uneventful.
The headaches?
No. No headaches.
Doctor seemed pleased.
That's all from this morning?
Yes. This young man
has submitted his manuscript.
I've found three errors of fact
and two spelling mistakes,
and I'm not yet on page four.
Have you had breakfast?
Yes.
Liar.
Virginia, it's not my insistence.
It's your own doctor's.
I'm going to send Nelly up
with some fruit and a bun.
Right. Lunch, then.
Proper lunch, husband and
wife sitting down together...
soup, pudding and all.
By force if necessary.
Leonard, I believe
I may have a first sentence.
Work, then.
Then you must eat.
Mrs. Dalloway said...
she would buy the flowers...
herself.
Mrs. Dalloway said she would
buy the flowers herself.
Sally, I think I'll buy
the flowers myself.
What?
What flowers?
Oh, shit. I forgot.
You're never going to be a big boy
if you don't eat your breakfast.
You're going to be the big brother.
It's a very important job.
Happy birthday.
-Morning, honey.
-Oh, Dan.
Roses on your own birthday.
You're too much.
Really.
He'll eat it now that you're here.
It's your birthday. You shouldn't
be out buying me flowers.
Well, you were still sleeping.
So?
Well, we decided it would be better
if we let you sleep in
a little, didn't we?
Morning, bug.
You need to rest, Laura.
You're only four months away.
Dan, don't.
I'm fine. I'm just tired.
I've been telling him
he's got to eat his breakfast.
That's true.
So, it's a beautiful day.
What are you two going
to be doing with it?
We've got our plans, don't we?
What plans?
Hmm...
Well, it wouldn't be much of a party,
would it, if I told you
every detail in advance?
Well, I better just stop
asking questions then, huh?
That the time?
I better get going.
Have a good day.
You, too.
Dan, happy birthday.
Oh, thank you.
You need to finish your breakfast.
Oh, I'm going to make a cake.
That's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to make the cake
for Daddy's birthday.
Mommy, can I help?
Can I help make the cake?
Of course you can, sweet pea.
I'm not going to do
anything without you.
No, of course. You have to come.
Of course.
Well, I always wanted you
and everybody involved
in the actual ceremony.
I don't know. Around 60.
Well, it will. It'll mean so much.
The whole occasion.
It's the least I can do to
have a nice dinner and...
say thank you to everybody.
You've done so much for him.
Oh, I take that as a yes.
He'll be thrilled.
Oh, my God.
I'm thrilled.
Oh, good.
What if nobody comes?
This is Clarissa Vaughan.
Yes, I am just confirming
that you're sending a car
to pick me up first.
Yeah.
-Hi, Clarissa.
-Hi, can't talk.
And then we're
going over to 679 Hudson,
which is at 9th and 14th.
Then you will take me uptown
and you will wait for us.
And it'll be over at seven.
Flowers!
What a beautiful morning.
Hi, Clarissa.
How are you?
I'm having a party.
My friend Richard's won the Carruthers.
Well, that's just terrific...
if I knew what it was.
It's a poetry prize for a life's work.
It's the most prestigious.
For a poet, it's the best you can do.
Oh, very good.
So, what would you like?
The lilies are perfect.
No. Too morbid.
Hydrangeas, I think.
And, um... oh, oh, let's
just have buckets of roses.
And...
I think I'm going to
take these with me.
Rodney?
Okay.
Thank you.
I actually tried
to read Richard's novel.
You did?
Oh, I know. It's not easy.
I know.
It did take him ten years to write.
Maybe it just takes
another ten to read.
It's you, isn't it?
What is?
In the novel, isn't it meant to be you?
Oh, I see.
Yeah.
Sort of.
I mean, in a way.
You know, Richard's a writer.
That's what he is.
He uses things which actually happen.
Yeah.
And years ago, he and I were...
students. That's true.
But, you know, then he changes things.
Oh, sure.
I don't mean in a bad way.
It's more like...
he makes them his own.
A woman's whole life...
in a single day,
just one day...
and in that day,
her whole life.
This is what we need.
Shortening...
Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.
Yes, it's me!
Oh... It's me.
Come in.
Richard, it's a beautiful morning.
How about we let in
a little more light?
Is it still morning?
Yes, it is.
Have I died?
Good morning, my dear.
Any visitors?
Yes.
Are they still here?
No. They've gone.
Mm. How'd they look?
Today?
Sort of like black fire.
I mean, sort of light and
dark at the same time.
There was one a bit
like an electrified jellyfish.
They were singing.
May have been Greek.
So the ceremony is at 5:00.
Do you remember?
And then... the party
is right after.
They did bring you breakfast,
didn't they?
What a question. Of course.
Richard, you did eat it?
Well, can you see it?
Is it here?
Any breakfast lying around?
No, I don't see it.
Well, then I must have
eaten it, mustn't I?
I suppose.
Does it matter?
Of course, it matters.
You know what the doctors say.
Have you been skipping pills?
Clarissa, I can't take this.
Take what?
Having to be proud and brave
in front of everybody.
Oh. Honey, it's not
a performance.
Of course it is. I got the
prize for my performance.
Well, that is nonsense.
I got the prize for having AIDS
and going nuts
and being brave about it.
I actually got the prize
for having come through.
It's not true.
-For surviving, that's what
-It's not true.
I got the prize for.
Oh, you think they
would have given it to me
if I were healthy?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
Is it here somewhere?
What?
The prize.
I'd like to look at it.
No, you haven't gotten it yet.
It's tonight.
Are you sure?
-Um...
-I remember the ceremony perfectly.
I seem to have fallen out of time.
Richard.
Richard... it's a party,
and it's only a party.
Hmm? Populated entirely
by people who respect and admire you.
A small party, is it?
A select party, is it?
Your friends.
I thought I lost all my friends.
I thought I drove my friends crazy.
Jesus.
Oh, Mrs. Dalloway,
always giving parties
to cover the silence.
Richard...
You won't need to do anything.
All you have to do is appear,
sit on the sofa.
And I will be there.
This is a group of people
who want to tell you
your work is going to live.
Oh, is it?
Is my work going to live?
I can't go through with it, Clarissa.
Oh... Why do you say that?
-I can't.
-Why?
Because I wanted
to be a writer, that's all.
So?
I wanted to write about it all.
Everything that happens in a moment.
The way the flowers looked
when you carried them in your arms.
This towel, how it... smells,
how it feels.
This thread.
All our feelings, yours and mine.
The history of it, who we once were.
Everything in the world.
Everything all mixed up...
like it's all mixed up now.
And I failed.
I failed.
No matter what you start with,
it ends up being so much less.
Sheer fucking pride...
and stupidity.
We want everything, don't we?
I suppose we do.
You kissed me on a beach.
Yeah.
Do you remember...
how many years ago?
Of course.
What did you want then?
Come closer.
I'm right here.
Come closer, would you, please?
Take my hand.
Would you be angry?
Would I be angry if you
didn't show up at the party?
Would you be angry if I died?
If you died?
Who is this party for?
What do you mean, who's it for?
What are you asking?
What are you trying to say?
I'm not trying to say anything.
Mm.
I'm saying...
I think I'm only staying alive
to satisfy you.
Well...
so that is what we do.
That is what people do.
They stay alive for each other.
And the doctors told you,
you-you don't need to die.
They told you that.
You can... live
like this for years.
Well, exactly.
I don't accept this.
I don't accept what you say.
Oh.
And it's for you to decide, is it?
How long have you been doing that?
How many years?
Coming to the apartment.
What about your own life?
What about Sally?
Just wait till I die.
Then you'll have to think of yourself.
How are you going to like that?
Richard...
it would be great
if you did come to the party,
if you felt well enough to come.
Just to let you know, I
am making the crab thing.
Not that I imagine
it makes any difference to you.
Of course, it makes a difference.
I love the crab thing.
Clarissa?
Yes?
I'll be back at 3:30,
and I'll help you get dressed.
Wonderful.
3:30.
Wonderful.
It's on this day,
this day of all days...
her fate becomes clear to her.
Excuse me, Mrs. Woolf.
Mr. Woolf said I was to come
and speak with you.
I've nearly finished, Nelly.
You can tell me in the kitchen.
I'll be down very soon.
Hmm.
What happens is,
she says she wants something,
and then it turns out she doesn't.
Well, she never does, does she?
She never wants anything.
Mm-hmm.
Especially when she's
particularly after it.
That's a sure sign.
I wish I'd been there.
I wish you had, too.
Did you give her that look?
That sort of look you do?
I said, Madam...
Yes, Nelly, tell me.
How can I help?
It's about lunch.
I just had to go ahead on my own.
I understand.
You chose a pie?
I chose a lamb pie.
That seems suitable.
You being so busy with your writing...
I had no instructions.
You do remember
that my sister is coming
at 4:00 with the children?
Yes, ma'am. I hadn't forgotten.
China tea, I think.
And ginger.
Ginger, Madam?
I'd like to give the children a treat.
We'd have to go to London
for ginger, Madam.
I haven't finished this,
and there's the rest
of lunch to get ready.
The 12:30 train, Nelly,
will get you
into London just after 1:00.
If you return on the 2:30,
you should be back in Richmond
soon after 3:00.
Do I miscalculate?
No.
Well, then, is something
detaining you, Nelly?
I can't think of anything
more exhilarating
than a trip to London.
-Good morning, Mrs. Woolf.
-Good morning.
We shall publish no more new authors.
I have to tell you, I've discovered
ten errors in the first proof.
Lucky to have found them then.
Passiondale was a...
charnel house
from which no min returned.
Do you think it's possible that
bad writing actually attracts a higher
incidence of error?
If it's all right, I thought
I might take a short walk.
Not far?
No. Just for air.
Go then.
If I could walk mid-morning,
I'd be a happy man.
She'll die.
She's going to die.
That's what's going to happen.
Huh.
That's it.
She'll kill herself.
She'll kill herself over something
which doesn't seem to matter.
Let's think.
You grease the pan, Mommy.
I know you grease the pan, sweet one.
Even Mommy knows that.
This is what we're going to do.
Flour... bowl... sifter.
Can I do it, Mommy?
Can you sift the flour?
Yes, you can sift the flour, baby,
if that's what makes you happy.
Yeah.
Isn't it beautiful?
Don't you think it looks like snow?
Hmm?
Okay.
Now, the next thing...
The next thing I'm going to show you...
uh, is...
we measure out the cups.
Mommy, it isn't that difficult.
Now, I know.
I know it isn't difficult.
It's just that I...
I just want to do this for Daddy.
Because it's his birthday?
That's right.
We're baking the cake
to show him that we love him.
Otherwise he won't know we love him?
That's right.
I got all the stuff.
I'm going right out again.
My God, what a zoo!
Why do people have to talk
about dry cleaning?
I mean, what is there to talk about?
I bought you some flowers.
Where are you?
In here.
I got someone at work to cover me.
I'll be with you all night.
Are you all right?
Sure.
I guess you saw Richard.
That's right.
Well, of course.
I bet he said, 'Oh, by the
way, honey, do you mind?
Can I skip the party?'
Don't worry. He always shows up.
Oh, sure.
In the end.
What, Richard miss an award?
A chance to talk about his work.
I don't think so.
He'll show up.
You did the seating.
I did.
I don't believe it... Louis Waters.
Is Louis coming?
Richard's Louis?
He is.
You put him next to me.
Why do I always have
to sit next to the exes?
Is this some kind of a hint,
sweetheart?
And, anyway, shouldn't
the exes have a table
of their own,
where they can all ex together
in ex-quisite agony?
I'm off.
Try not to pass out from excitement.
Clarissa... it's going
to be beautiful.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Why is everything wrong?
It didn't work. Damn it!
It didn't work.
Hey, Scott.
Hi, Mrs. Barlowe.
Mommy, Mommy, there's
someone at the door!
Hello?
Hello? Laura?
Hi, Kitty.
Hi. Am I interrupting?
Oh, of course not. Come in.
Are you all right?
Why, sure.
Hi, Richie.
Sit down. I've got coffee on.
Um, would you like some?
Please.
Oh, look.
You made a cake.
I know.
Didn't work.
I thought it was going to work.
I thought
it would work better than that.
Oh, Laura, I don't understand
why you find it so difficult.
I don't know either.
Anyone can make a cake.
I know.
Everyone can. It's ridiculously easy.
Like, I bet you didn't
even grease the pan.
I greased the pan.
All right.
You know, you have other virtues...
and Dan loves you so much,
he won't even notice.
Whatever you do, he's going
to say it's wonderful.
Well, it's true.
Does Ray have a birthday?
Sure he does.
When is it?
September.
We go to the country club.
We always go to the country club.
We drink martinis and spend
the day with 50 people.
Ray's got a lot of friends. He does.
You both have a lot of friends.
You're good at it.
How is Ray?
I haven't seen him in a while.
Ray's fine.
Mmm.
These guys are something, aren't they?
You can say that again.
They came home from the war.
They deserved it, didn't they?
After what they'd been through.
What... did they deserve?
I don't know. Us, I guess.
All this.
Oh.
You're reading a book.
Yeah.
What's this one about?
Oh, it's about...
this woman who's incredibly...
Well, she's a hostess, and
she's incredibly confident,
and she's going to give a party,
and maybe because she's confident,
everyone thinks she's fine...
but she isn't.
So.
Well.
Kitty, what is it? Is something wrong?
I, uh...
I have to go into the hospital
for a couple of days.
Kitty.
Yeah. I have, um...
some kind of... growth,
in my uterus,
and they're going to go in
and take a look.
When?
This afternoon.
Well, I need you to feed the dog.
Of course.
Is that what you came here to ask?
What did the doctor say exactly?
Well, it's probably
what the trouble's been.
About getting pregnant.
The thing is...
I mean, you know, I've been...
really happy with Ray.
And now it turns out
there was a reason.
There was a reason I couldn't conceive.
You're lucky, Laura.
I don't think you
can call yourself a woman
until you're a mother.
The joke is...
all my life I could do everything.
I mean, I could do anything, really.
Except the one thing I wanted.
Yes.
That's all.
Well, at least now they'll
be able to deal with it.
That's right.
That's what they're doing.
That's right.
Mm. I'm not worried.
What would be the point of worrying?
No, it's not in your hands.
But that's it.
It's in the hands of some
physician I've never even met.
Some surgeon who probably
drinks more martinis
-than Ray and...
-Oh, Kitty.
I'm mean, of course I'm worried
about Ray.
Come here.
I'm doing fine.
Really.
I know. I know you are.
I'm more worried about Ray.
If anything,
he's not good with this stuff.
Forget about him, hmm?
Just forget about Ray.
You're sweet.
You know the routine, right?
Half a can in the evening, and...
check the water now and then,
and Ray will feed him in the morning.
Kitty, you didn't mind?
What?
I didn't mind what?
Do you want me to drive you?
I think I'll feel better
if I drive myself.
Kitty, it's going to be all right.
Of course it is.
Bye.
What? What do you want?
Mr. Woolf, Mrs. Bell
has arrived.
Not due till 4:00.
I can't help it.
She's here.
You look a perfect angel.
Don't let the boys make fun of you.
Fly away, fly.
Virginia.
Leonard thinks it's
the end of civilization...
people who are invited
at 4:00 and arrive at 2:30.
Oh, God.
Barbarians.
Well, we finished lunch
sooner than we imagined.
I've had to send Nelly off
to London for sugar ginger.
Oh, Virginia.
You're not still frightened
of the servants, are you?
Come on.
And how are you, sister?
Frantic.
It's been ridiculous in London.
Ridiculous? How?
Busy.
Why is busy ridiculous?
I would have invited you to our party,
but I knew you wouldn't come.
Did you?
How did you know that?
I thought you never came to town.
That's because you no longer ask me.
Are you not forbidden to come?
Do the doctors not forbid it?
Oh, the doctors.
Do you not pay heed to your doctors?
Not when they're a bunch
of contemptible Victorians.
So... what are you saying?
Are you feeling better?
Has this vastness made you stronger?
I'm saying, Vanessa, that even
crazy people like to be asked.
Nessa! Nessa!
Nessa! Nessa!
Hello, changelings. What have you got?
What have you found?
We found a bird.
Did you?
Yes.
Where did you find that?
I think it must have
fallen from a tree.
Oh, my goodness.
Just look at him.
We might be able to save him.
Save him?
I think you have
to be careful, Quentin.
There's a time to die, and
it may be the bird's time.
Come on, let's pick some
grass to make a grave.
-Oh, Julian.
-I'm just saying.
Then at least there'll be
a bed for him to die on.
Come on, Nessa, let's make a grave.
Nessa, come on!
Oh... Very well, I'm coming.
Wait for me then.
Angelica, will you be all right?
Stay with your aunt.
You're going too fast.
Do you think she'd like roses?
Is it a she?
Yes, the females are larger.
And less colourful.
What happens when we die?
What happens?
We return to the place
that we came from.
I don't remember where I came from.
Nor do I.
She looks very small.
Yes.
Yes, that's one
of the things that happens...
we look smaller.
But very peaceful.
Oh, is it done?
Have we finished?
Is the bird funeral complete?
Yes.
Very well, then.
Are we to be denied tea
altogether for coming so early?
No, of course not.
Good.
Come on, Angelica.
Come on, come on, boys.
Let's get some tea.
Nessa, tell him to stop it!
Now stop it, Julian.
Virginia, we're going in.
Virginia!
Hey, bug.
I've got this idea.
We're going to make another cake.
We're going to make a better one.
What happened to the first one?
And after that...
I think we should go out.
Yes?
Clarissa, it's Louis.
Louis Waters.
Louis?
Oh, my God.
You're early.
Do you mind? Is it all right?
Oh, why should I mind?
I'm delighted!
Well, now!
I feel like I'm interrupting.
Oh, why? No.
I know the ceremony
isn't until 5:00,
but I flew in this morning.
Oh, well, Richard's
going to be thrilled.
He'll be thrilled to see you.
You think so?
Of course.
What are we doing?
We should go in.
Are you all right?
Yes. It's nothing. It's just the party.
Oh, right.
Oh, wow!
It's looking beautiful.
Thanks.
Are you still with...?
Yes, I am.
Still with her. Ten years.
It's crazy.
Why is it crazy?
No reason.
Would you like something to drink?
Some water.
Okay.
Are you still an editor?
Oh, sure.
With the same publisher?
Mm-hmm.
How's San Francisco?
Oh, it's one of those cities
people tell you to like.
Richard said he thought
you were happy out there.
Oh, great.
So now the illness makes him psychic.
You have to prepare yourself, Louis.
He's very changed.
I read the book.
Oh, God...
Exactly.
I thought you were meant to do more
than just change people's names.
-Well...
-Isn't it meant to be fiction?
He even had you living on 10th Street.
It isn't me.
Isn't it?
You know how Richard is.
It's a fantasy.
A whole chapter on 'Should
she buy some nail polish'?
And then, guess what? After
50 pages, she doesn't.
The whole thing seems to go on
for eternity.
Nothing happens. And then, wham!
For no reason, she kills herself.
His mother kills herself.
Yeah, sure, his mother,
but still for no reason.
-Well, I...
-Out of the blue.
I know the book is tough,
but I liked it.
I know.
Only one thing upset me.
What's that? What upset you?
Well... that there
wasn't more about you.
That's kind.
I went back to Wellfleet.
You did?
One day.
I didn't tell you?
No.
But then, I never see you.
You remember the house.
It's still there.
I think you're courageous.
Courageous? Why?
To dare go visit.
What I mean is...
to face the fact
that we have lost
those feelings forever.
Shit!
-Clarissa?
-Um...
I don't know what's happening.
I'm sorry.
I seem to be in some
strange sort of mood.
I'm sorry. It's, uh,
it's very rude of me.
I seem to be unravelling.
I shouldn't have come.
No, it's not you. It's not you.
It's more like having a presentiment.
Do you know what I'm saying?
Oh, God, it's probably just nerves
about the party, you know?
Bad hostess!
Clarissa, what's happened?
Jesus!
What is it?
Oh! Oh, God!
Do you want me to go?
No, don't go! Don't...
Don't go.
Explain to me why this is happening.
Don't...
don't touch me. Jesus.
It's better if you don't.
It's just too much.
You fly in from San Francisco,
and I've been nursing Richard
for years.
And all the time,
I've held myself together...
no problem.
I know.
One morning, in Wellfleet...
you were there, we were all there...
I'd been sleeping with him,
and I was out on the back porch.
He came out behind me,
and he put his hand on my shoulder.
Good morning, Mrs. Dalloway.
That's...
That's when...
From then on, I've...
been stuck.
Stuck?
Yep.
Yeah.
With the name, I mean.
And now you walk in.
To see you
walk in...
because I never see you. Look at you.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
It was you he stayed with.
It was you he lived with.
I had one summer.
The day I left him,
I got on a train
and made my way across Europe.
I felt free
for the first time in years.
So... tell me about
San Francisco.
What's to tell?
I still teach drama to idiots, mostly.
They can't all be idiots.
No, no. In fact,
I shouldn't tell you this, but...
I've fallen in love.
Really?
Yes.
With a student.
With a student.
Exactly.
I know.
You think, Am I still up for this?
All this intensity,
all those arguments,
doors being slammed.
Well, you know what it's like.
Are you feeling better?
A little. Thank you.
You think I'm ridiculous?
Ridiculous?
Fortunate, too.
I'm going to leave you
at Mrs. Latch's.
I have to do something.
Mommy, I don't want to go.
You have to. I'm sorry.
I have something to do
before Daddy gets home.
Hello.
Hi, Mrs. Latch.
My boy's not very happy.
Mommy, I don't want to do this.
I have to go, honey.
Your mommy has things she has to do.
Come in, I got cookies.
Okay, baby?
You have to be brave now.
Don't worry now.
It's going to be fine.
Well...
Honey!
Come on. Come on, darling.
Mommy!
-Stop it.
-No!
Darling, stop it.
Mommy!
-All right.
-Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Come on.
Mommy!
Mommy!
No!
Breakfast is served between 7:and 11:00 in the Regency Room,
and room service is available 24 hours.
Thank you, ma'am.
Is there anything else you need?
Yes, um...
No.
Not to be disturbed.
'Did it matter, then? '
She asked herself,
walking toward Bon Street.
Did it matter that she must
inevitably cease completely?
All this must go on without her.
Did she resent it?
Or did it not become consoling
to believe that death ended absolutely?
It is possible to die.
It is possible... to die.
There was a lovely coat
for Angelica at Harrod's,
then nothing for the boys.
It seems so unfair.
Why should Angelica be favoured?
Virginia?
Virginia?
Virginia!
What are you thinking about?
Are you still with us?
Your aunt's a very
lucky woman, Angelica...
because she has two lives.
She has the life she's leading,
and also the book she's writing.
This makes her very fortunate indeed.
What were you thinking about?
I was going to kill my heroine...
but I've changed my mind.
I... I can't.
I fear I may have to kill
someone else instead.
Oh, Quentin!
We're ready!
A fascinating visit.
We enjoyed it thoroughly.
Do you have to go already?
I do wish you wouldn't go.
Oh, Virginia, the last thing
you want is our noisiness.
My hopeless, clumsy boys.
Say good-bye, boys.
Bye!
You'll return to what?
Tonight?
Oh, just some...
insufferable dinner.
Not even you could envy, Virginia.
But I do.
Say something, Nessa.
Didn't you think I seemed better?
Yes...
Yes... Virginia, you seemed better.
You think...
You think I may one day escape?
One day. One...
Nessa.
Nessa!
Come on, Nessa.
Come, Angelica, we must go.
Come on!
Good-bye.
Good-bye, little girl.
Angelica!
The train!
We're going to miss the train.
-Come on.
-Hurry up. Big step.
Come on, come on, come on!
I want to go home.
Yeah, all right.
We stayed too long,
we've missed the train.
Stay close.
I'm sorry, I know.
I tried to get here earlier.
I tried, okay? Don't start.
I know, it's just incredibly
important because it's your party.
Julia,
how have you been doing?
I'm fine.
Come here.
What have you been doing?
Well, studying, Mom.
Um...
So, what should I do? Chairs?
No. Let's clear off the desk
first.
You can take it into the bedroom.
I bumped into Louis Waters.
Oh, you did?
Where?
In the street.
They're all here, aren't they?
All the ghosts.
All of the ghosts are
assembling for the party.
He's so weird.
Oh, what?
You can't see that?
You can't see that
Louis Waters is weird?
I can see that he's sad.
Well...
all your friends are sad.
You've been crying.
What's happening?
All it is, I looked around
this room, and I thought,
I'm giving a party. All I want to do
is give a party.
And?
I know why he does it ;
he does it deliberately.
Oh, is this Richard?
Of course.
He did it this morning.
He gives me that look.
What look?
To say...
Your life is... trivial.
You are so trivial.
Just... daily stuff, you know.
Schedules and parties
and... details.
That's what he means... by it,
that is what he's saying.
Mom, it only matters
if you think it's true.
Well?
Do you? Tell me.
When I'm with him, I feel...
Yes, I am living.
And when I'm not with him...
Yes, everything does seem sort of s...
...silly.
I don't mean with you.
Oh, I... God. Jesus.
Never with you.
It's all the rest of it.
Sally?
The rest of it.
False comfort.
Because?
If you say to me,
When were you happiest?
Mom...
Tell me the moment you were happiest.
I know, I know, it was years ago.
Yeah.
All you're saying is...
you were once young.
I remember one morning...
getting up at dawn,
there was such a sense of possibility.
You know?
That feeling?
Hmm?
And I remember thinking to myself,
So, this is the beginning of happiness.
This is where it starts.
And, of course, there
will always be more.
It never occurred to me
it wasn't the beginning.
It was happiness.
It was the moment...
right then.
Ah, Nelly, good evening.
I was wondering
if you'd seen Mrs. Woolf.
I thought you knew, sir. Mrs.
Woolf has gone out.
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Mr. Woolf, what an
unexpected pleasure.
Perhaps you could tell me exactly
what you think you're doing?
What I was doing?
I went to look for you,
and you weren't there.
You were working in the garden.
I didn't wish to disturb you.
You disturb me when you disappear.
I didn't disappear.
I went for a walk.
A walk?
Is that all? Just a walk?
Virginia, we must go home now.
Nelly's cooking dinner.
She's already had a very difficult day.
It's just our obligation
to eat Nelly's dinner.
There is no such obligation.
No such obligation exists.
Virginia, you have an
obligation to your own sanity.
I have endured this custody!
I have endured this imprisonment.
Oh, Virginia!
I am attended by doctors, everywhere.
I am attended by doctors
who inform me of my own interests!
They know your interests.
They do not!
They do not speak for my interests.
Virginia, I can...
I can see that it must be
hard for a woman of your...
Of what? Of my what, exactly?
Uh, your... your talents to see
that she may not be the best
judge of her own condition!
Who, then, is a better judge?
You have a history!
You have a history of confinement.
We brought you to Richmond because
you have a history of fits,
moods, blackouts, hearing voices.
We brought you here to save you
from the irrevocable damage
you intended upon yourself.
You've tried to kill yourself twice!
I live daily with that threat.
I set up the press...
we set up the printing
press not just for itself,
not just purely for itself,
but so that you might have
a ready source
of absorption and of remedy.
Like needlework?
It was done for you!
It was done for your betterment!
It was done out of love!
If I didn't know you better,
I'd call this ingratitude.
I am ungrateful?
You call me ungrateful?
My life has been stolen from me.
I'm living in a town
I have no wish to live in.
I'm living... a life
I have no wish to live.
How did this happen?
It is time for us
to move back to London.
I miss London.
I miss London life.
This is not you speaking, Virginia.
This is an aspect of your illness.
-It's not you.
-It is me. It is my voice.
It's not your voice.
It's mine and mine alone.
This is the voice that you hear.
It is not! It is mine!
I'm dying in this town!
If you were thinking clearly, Virginia,
you'd recall it was London
that brought you low.
If I were thinking clearly...
If I were thinking clearly...
We brought you to Richmond
to give you peace.
If I were thinking clearly, Leonard,
I would tell you that I wrestle
alone in the dark,
in the deep dark,
and that only I can know,
only I can understand my own condition.
You live with the threat...
you tell me...
you live with the threat
of my extinction.
Leonard, I live with it, too.
This is my right.
It is the right of every human being.
I choose not the suffocating
anaesthetic of the suburbs,
but the violent jolt of the capital.
That is my choice.
The meanest patient,
yes, even the very lowest
is allowed some say
in the matter of her own prescription.
Thereby she defines her humanity.
I wish, for your sake, Leonard,
I could be happy in this quietness.
But if it is a choice between
Richmond and death,
I choose death.
Very well, London, then.
We'll go back to London.
You hungry?
I'm a little hungry myself.
Come along.
London train on platform one!
This is the London train
terminating at Vauxhall.
You cannot find peace
by avoiding life, Leonard.
This is the London train!
London train on platform one!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Hey. Hey, there, bug.
Hey, what's wrong?
Hi, Mrs. Latch.
Sorry I'm late.
He's fine.
He's been fine.
He's, he's just happy to see you.
Aw, it couldn't have been
that bad, could it? Hmm?
So, you got it cut, then?
Oh, yes, yes. No problem.
Looks great.
Well, they didn't have to do very much.
Well, we had a fine time together.
Thank you very much.
So, that wasn't too bad, was it?
I wasn't gone too long.
No, you weren't long.
That's right.
At one point...
I don't know.
There was a moment where
I thought I might be longer.
But I changed my mind.
What is it, honey?
Mommy, I love you.
I love you, too, baby.
What's wrong?
What?
Don't worry, honey, everything's fine.
We're going to have a wonderful party,
and we've made your daddy
such a nice cake.
I love you, sweetheart.
You're my guy.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Richard, it's me. I'm early.
What the hell is going on?
Richard!
What are you doing here?
You're early!
Wha-What is going on here?
What are you doing?
I-I had this wonderful idea.
I needed some light.
I needed to let in some light!
Richard, what are you doing?
I had this fantastic notion.
I took the Xanax
and the Ritalin together.
It-it never occurred to me.
-Richard...
-Don't come near me!
It seemed to me I needed
to let in some light.
What do you think?
I cleared away all the windows.
All right, Richard,
do me one simple favour.
Come. Come sit.
I don't think I can make it
to the party, Clarissa.
You don't have to go to the party.
You don't have to go to the ceremony.
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.
You can do as you like.
But I still have to face
the hours, don't I?
I mean, the hours after the party,
and the hours after that...
You do have good days still.
You know you do.
Not really.
I mean, it's kind of you
to say so, but it's...
I mean,
not really true.
Are they here?
Who?
The voices.
Oh, the voices are always here.
And it's the voices that you're
hearing now, isn't it?
No, no, no, no.
Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.
I've stayed alive for you,
but now you have to let me go.
-Richard, I...
-No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
Tell me a story.
What about?
Tell me a story from your day.
I, um... I-I got up...
Yes?
...and I went out, and, uh,
I went to buy flowers,
Like Mrs. Dalloway,
in the book, you know?
Yes.
And it was a beautiful morning.
Was it?
Yes, it was so beautiful.
It was so fresh.
Oh, fresh, was it?
Yes.
Like a...
like a morning on the beach?
Yes.
Like that?
Yes.
Like that morning when you
walked out of that old house,
and you were, you were 18,
and maybe I was 19.
Yes.
I was 19 years old,
and I'd never seen
anything so beautiful.
You... coming out
of a glass door
in the early morning, still sleepy.
Isn't it strange?
Most ordinary morning
in anybody's life.
I'm afraid I can't make it
to the party, Clarissa.
The party...
doesn't matter.
You've been so good to me,
Mrs. Dalloway.
I love you.
I don't think two people
could've been happier than we've been.
Oh, God, no!
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday, Dan.
This is perfect.
This is just perfect.
Oh, do you think so?
Do you really think so?
Why, sure.
You must've been working all day.
Well, that's what we were doing.
Weren't we, bug?
Been working all day.
This is just fantastic.
It's what I've always wanted.
Oh, Dan.
One day, Richie, I'll tell you.
I'll tell you how it all happened.
Don't.
I want to.
I want to tell him the story.
What happened...
when I was in the war.
At war, I found myself
thinking about this girl
that I had seen...
I had never met her...
at high school,
this... strange,
fragile-looking girl
named Laura McGrath.
Yeah.
And she was shy...
and she was interesting.
And... well,
your mother won't mind if
I tell you this, Richie.
She was the sort of girl that you see
sitting mostly on her own.
And I'll tell you...
sometimes, when I was
in the South Pacific,
the fact is that I used to think
about this girl.
Dan.
I used to think
about bringing her to
a house, to a life.
Pretty much like this.
And it was the thought
of the happiness...
the thought of this woman,
the thought of this life...
that's what kept me going.
I had an idea of our happiness.
Why does someone have to die?
Leonard...
In your book,
you said someone had to die.
Hmm.
Why?
Is that a stupid question?
No.
I imagine my question is stupid.
Not at all.
Well?
Someone has to die
in order that the rest of us
should value life more.
It's contrast.
And who will die?
Tell me.
The poet will die.
The visionary.
What are you doing?
I'm brushing my teeth.
Are you coming to bed?
Yeah, in a minute.
Come to bed, Laura Brown.
I ran into Ray.
He said Kitty had to
go to the hospital.
I know.
Nothing serious. He
said just a check-up.
I'm terrified.
Why?
Only I knew that she could disappear.
Maybe you could go see her
in the morning, honey.
I was going to. I was going to stop by.
I've had a wonderful day,
and I have you to thank.
Come to bed, honey.
I'm coming.
Are you coming?
Yes.
What?
I was hoping you were going to bed.
I am.
I am going to bed.
What, then?
All else is clear.
The outline of the story is planned,
now one thing only.
Mrs. Dalloway's destiny
must be resolved.
You're Laura Brown.
Yes, I'm Richard's mother.
Of course.
I'm Clarissa Vaughan.
Please come in.
My friend Sally is in the kitchen,
and my daughter.
I'll take this.
We were having a party.
We were going to have a party.
I was lucky.
I got the last plane from Toronto.
So, that's the monster.
Hope I did the right thing.
I found your number in his phone book.
Yes, he had it.
We didn't speak often.
It's a terrible thing, Miss Vaughan...
to outlive your whole family.
Richard's father died.
Yes, he-he died of cancer
quite young.
And Richard's sister is dead.
Obviously, you...
feel unworthy.
Gives you feelings of unworthiness.
You survive and they don't.
Have you read the poems?
Oh, yes. Oh...
I also read the novel.
You see, uh,
people say the novel is difficult.
Uh... I know.
They say that.
I know.
He had me die in the novel.
I-I-I know why he did that.
It hurt, of course.
I can't pretend it didn't hurt,
but I...
I know why he did it.
You left Richard when he was a child.
I left both my children.
I abandoned them.
They say it's the worst thing
a mother can do.
You have a daughter.
Yes...
But I never met Julia's father.
You so wanted a child.
That's right.
You're a lucky woman.
There are times when you don't belong,
and you think you're going
to kill yourself.
Once, I went to a hotel.
Later that night, I made a plan.
The plan was I would leave my family
when my second child was born...
and that's what I did.
I got up one morning,
made breakfast,
went to the bus stop,
got on a bus.
I'd left a note.
I got a job in a library in Canada.
It would...
be wonderful to say you regretted it.
It would be easy.
But what does it mean?
What does it mean to regret...
when you have no choice?
It's what you can bear.
There it is.
No one's going to forgive me.
It was death.
I chose life.
Time to take your coat off.
I thought you might like a cup of tea.
Oh my goodness.
Thank you, dear.
I feel like I'm stealing your room.
Um, we put the food away,
so, if you're at all hungry
in the night,
just help yourself.
Oh, I will.
Where will you sleep?
Oh, the sofa.
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Good night, sweetheart.
Good night.
Dear Leonard,
to look life in the face...
always to look life in the face,
and to know it for what it is.
At last, to know it,
to love it for what it is, and then...
to put it away.
Leonard...
always the years between us,
always the years...
always...
the love...
always...
the hours.

(man's voice on radio)
(inhales)
(phone rings)
(in Greek) Yes.
(woman) How are you?
- Good.
- It's been a while.
Your grandmother? Better?
Worse.
She's lucky to have you.
Your father would have been proud
that you are taking care of her.
Look...
I wanted to ask you,
what time will you be home tomorrow?
In the afternoon, after work. Why?
I have sent you something small.
It's different from the others.
We'll talk tomorrow. Good night.
Good night.
(man's voice on radio)
100, 200, 300, 400, 20...
And two euros.
This is the last of it.
I'll get in touch with you
if I need you again.
(groans)
(woman) I didn't want to send
a German book again
but something to get familiar
with the area here.
I've written our address
on the first page.
She left us this morning.
Will you come?
I would have come for sure...
But I am alone with Patrick these days.
It's difficult for me to leave.
I can't leave him with Helga.
I don't trust her.
It's also his birthday this Sunday
and I have to organise a party.
I wish I could be there.
(man)
We offer a very economical package.
1050 euros for the entire ceremony.
We provide the hearse
and two people to transport the coffin.
We need two more.
One more person besides you.
The price doesn't include
the workers who dig the grave.
With the digging of the grave,
the price will be 1200 euros.
Shall I presume
that a family grave already exists?
Then we have coffee, rusk, and brandy.
Two euros per person.
If we expect around fifty people,
then the price will be 1500 euros.
Unless the deceased was popular. Hmm?
Was she popular?

(in German) Lesson one.
I live in Munich. Bayern is wonderful.
(in Greek) Lesson one.
I live in Munich.
Excuse me! You cannot sleep here!
(in English) Here you are!
Your sandwich.
It's ham and cheese.
Take it. You deserve it.
No.
You stole it.
(man) OK.
Travelling alone?
Are you Italian?
Not Italian.
You're Greek then.
Chances are almost 50-50.
The ship goes from Greece to Italy.
You?
I'm the outsider.
I'm German.
(in German) I'm from Germany.
Good day.
(in English) You don't look German.
You don't look Greek.
I come to Greece every summer.
This time I went to Kefalonia.
What about you?
How was your summer?
Fantastic.
So where are you going?
North.
You have a car?
No.
Really?
Pity...
It's a lovely route by car.
Ciao.
Ciao.
(in English) Passengers travelling
without a vehicle,
are kindly requested to disembark
using the escalators.
We thank you for travelling
with SuperFast Ferries
and we look forward
to welcoming you again
on board of one of our vessels.
(in Italian) Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the port of Bari.
(in English) I thought you said
you don't have a car.
I knew you did.
I saw you yesterday in the garage.
But it's fine,
you don't have to feel bad about it.
I don't feel bad.
You want to be alone in the car.
I completely understand.
You do know how to get
out of town, right?
You see there?
That's the Molo Sud.
You go right, you pass the Lazaretto
and at the roundabout,
you take the second exit to the right,
via Eugene Luigi.
And at the next roundabout,
you take the third exit.
I've done it a hundred times by car
and it's amazing.
Especially if you know
which routes to take.
Alright then.
Safe trip.
I can drive you up until one point.
I'm going north.
But we share the gas money.
Of course.
What is your name?
My name is Mathias.
- Yours?
- Victoras.
(tunes radio)
(music on radio)
(turns music off)
You want to check
if I'm driving to the right direction?
There is no right direction.
Just...
Can we please not take the autostrada?
Why?
It's boring.
There's nothing to see there.
I know beautiful provincial roads.
- (Mathias) What's this?
- No, no, no. It's not music.
(woman in German) Hello, my name
is Ursula. Ursula Handtmann.
I'm twenty-six years old.
"Hello, my name is Ursula."
- Ursula Handtmann.
- "Ursula Handtmann."
I'm twenty-six years old.
I live in Munich. Bavaria is...
(in English)
I can teach you some German.
(in German) Are you hungry?
You have money?
(in English) You can tell so much
by how long it takes someone to order.
And by what he's having.
Mainly by what he's having.
- What am I having?
- That's easy.
A club sandwich.
You can't go wrong
with a club sandwich, right?
And I'm sure you never get pickles or
mustard to the side to spice things up.
- (in German) You're a fast-food kid.
- (in English) What?
You don't eat pickles, do you?
Pickles? I eat. Sometimes.
- (waiter, in Italian) Good morning.
- Good morning.
(waiter) What can I bring you?
(in English) I'll choose for you.
- (in Italian) Number 12 for me.
- (waiter) Number 12.
- And 54 for my friend.
- (waiter) Fifty-four.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
(in English)
What did you order? I'm very hungry.
- Angry?
- Hungry.
(in Italian) Sorry. ..
And a saucer with pickles, please.
- (waiter) Of course.
- Thanks.
(in English) What did you order?
I don't know,
I just said random numbers.
Tell me, what numbers did you order?
- Come on, don't spoil the surprise.
- Tell me the numbers.
If you don't like it, I'll pay.
You know, you can't steal
food from here.
I only steal food from places
that are irrationally expensive.
Oh.
Five euros for an awful sandwich
and it tasted like shit.
So in this case,
who is really the thief?
You.
So what's the reason for your trip?
No reason.
I'm going for a ride.
You are doing this entire trip
just for a ride?
(scoffs) No way.
Why are you going by car
and not by plane?
Why aren't you going by plane?
I'm going for a ride.
I got money in my pocket and
a month to spend before work starts.
What work?
I'm teaching snowboard and ski
at the Bavarian Alps.
It's fun.
(in Italian) Number 12.
Thank you.
Number 54.
(in English) You pay.
(in Italian) Have a nice meal.
Thank you.
(in English) Pickles?
(song on radio)
Take the next exit
and get off the autostrada.
No, I don't want
to get off the autostrada.
- We've lost a lot of time.
- Why?
Is someone waiting for you?
Since we're doing this trip,
I don't understand
why you don't want to enjoy it.
(Victoras) Maybe I'm in danger.
- You're in danger?
- Yeah.
The way you drive,
if someone is in danger, it's me.
I have put a stranger in my car.
How do I know
you're not a serial killer?
How do I know you're not going
to cut me into pieces?
Maybe that's why you insist
to get off the autostrada.
I don't see any reason
to cut you into pieces.
What if I just killed you?
Let's try the provincial road
for a while.
If you don't like my route,
we will go back to the autostrada.
Let's go.
I know these routes very well.
Trust me.
(Mathias) Let's play a game.
You know the game 20 questions?
(Victoras) No.
What? Everybody knows it.
Well, you put something in your mind
and I have 20 questions
to guess what it is.
I'll ask you questions,
and you answer with a yes or a no.
(Victoras)
How will I learn things about you?
(Mathias) You can better judge a man
by his questions
than by his answers.
(Victoras) Where do you read all this?
Oh! I was always wondering
who buys all those stupid books.
You can start
your questions if you want.
Go ahead.
- OK, I'll start.
- OK.
First question.
Have you lived
your whole life in Greece?
- Come on.
- Yes.
Second question. Do you have a job?
No.
Did you study anything?
I... started studying agriculture...
(Mathias) Agriculture?
I could never imagine that.
(Victoras)
But I didn't really finish that.
(Mathias) I need to pee.
(Victoras) What, here?
Not here. Keep driving down that road.
Why? Why drive down that road?
The time has come
to cut you into pieces.
- (Mathias) It's fine.
- (Victoras) Wait, wait, wait.
Wait!
(Mathias) Since you're studying
agriculture or whatever,
you can name all these trees here
with their scientific names
while I'm peeing.
(Victoras) You said you wanted to pee.
(Mathias) I am.
Would you have stopped
if I told you I also wanted to swim?
(Victoras) No.
What are you waiting for? Get in.
(Victoras) Oh, no.
Why? Can't you swim?
(Victoras) I am not getting in a lake
that you have pissed in.
Have you ever swum in a lake?
(Victoras) No.
Come on, get in.
For the experience.
I'll save you if you drown. Promise.
Good boy.
Should I tell you how to jump?
Slightly bend the knees
and then throw your weight forward.
And push with the legs.
Otherwise you will fall on your belly.
(Mathias) I'm an excellent teacher.
- It's nice, huh?
- (Victoras) Yeah. Nice.
(Mathias) So where did you learn this?
(Victoras) I'm not gonna tell you that.
- You were improvising?
- Yeah.
What a talent.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we found the best talent of Greece.
(Mathias) I told you this route was nicer.
You need to start trusting
the stranger in your car.
(Victoras laughs)
So, where were we?
Right!
Are you going to Germany?
- Did you search my stuff?
- So that's a yes.
No.
Yes.
Maybe.
Maybe?
This game is stupid.
You can't answer everything
with a yes or no.
- Yes.
- No.
I guess the world has become
too complex for simple answers.
(car horn)
(in Italian) Fuck you, asshole!
Stronzo in your face, asshole!
(in English) I really can't tell
who drives the worst,
Greeks or Italians.
I don't think it's a good idea
to go so fast here.
Why? Am I getting outside
my comfort zone?
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh!
(police siren)
(voice on police radio)
- (in Italian) Hello.
- Hello.
You know you were driving
over the limit?
(in English)
I told you not to drive so fast.
(in Italian)
Licence and registration, please.
(in English) Licence and car registration.
(in Italian) Calm down.
Who is Angeliki?
Who?
(in English) Who is Angeliki?
It's none of your business.
(in Italian) It's none of your business.
Have you been drinking?
- (Victoras) Yes.
- No.
Are you going to take our order, then?
Get out of the car.
Get out. Exit the car.
Let's go.
Come on.
(Mathias, in Italian) Thank you very much.
(in German) Thanks. Goodbye.
(in English) Lesson of the day:
people here can't take a joke.
Why did I take you with me?
Because you like me.
I don't like you.
You're so cruel.
You think it's wise to drive without
a licence in front of the police station?
It's your fault.
I wasn't driving
and you were speeding.
Fuck you.
We're just two strangers sharing a car.
My car.
Your car.
If you want,
I can be your personal driver.
- You have a licence?
- You should not know.
Where are we going?
(Mathias)
Somewhere to eat, drink and sleep.
But you must wear a shirt.
I don't think this is a good idea.
(Mathias)
You got something better to do tonight?
Is this why we got off the autostrada?
(yawns)
(Mathias) Have fun.
(music)
(cheering)
(Mathias) What makes them believe
they can spend their whole life
with the same person?
We're happy now.
Come on.
Tommaso, hi.
Mathias.
(in Italian) Hi. You came!
I brought a friend, OK?
Tommaso this is Victoras.
Victoras this is Tommaso.
- Hi, Victoras.
- Hi.
Strong handshake.
Are you German?
No.
- English?
- No.
- French?
- No.
- Bulgarian?
- No.
Ask him if he's Greek.
Greek?
- Yes.
- But of course!
(women chant)
(cheering)
(in English) Now we drink.
(in Italian) Cheers!
(in English)
Where did you and Mathias meet?
First time we met,
it was at the Greek Islands.
We had great time, the two of us.
Just the boys,
doing island hopping, drinking
and getting naked on the beach.
We then took the ferry to Italy.
And I gave him a ride in my car.
(Mathias) Did he pay for gas?
- (Mathias) Drink!
- Yes.
You don't drink?
Did I tell you?
This family makes the wine.
(Tommaso) Where did you two meet?
(Victoras) In Greece.
We did island hopping. Naked.
You are very different
from his other friends.
- Really?
- Really.
Come on, dance. Come on.
("Vita Sociale" by Canova)
(woman, in Italian) Here I am. Turn right.
Bye, beautiful.
Thanks a lot.
Bye.
You've forgotten something.
(in English) Remember her?
What happened to her?
She left her heart on the dance floor.
(in Italian) Here you go.
Your sandwich is ready.
Thanks.
Can you take me there?
What's there?
(Mathias) Is this it?
(Victoras) I won my first medal here.
Stay here.
That feeling when you're in the air
is incredible.
Your heart is pounding like crazy.
And the adrenaline
is rushing through you.
And in that one moment...
you're flying.
Light as a feather.
Until gravity pulls you down again,
just to remind you
that you can't escape.
Gravity will always
pull you down to the ground.
Who's Angeliki LÃ¶tz?
Well, who is she?
I told you, don't touch my stuff.
- (Mathias) We're not going there?
- No. I'm going home.
I made a big mistake.
Tell me where do you want me
to drop you off?
We're almost there.
Is she your girlfriend?
No, of course not, this I know.
Is she your mother?
Yes.
And you're angry with her? Yes.
Does she know that you took her car?
No.
Does she know
that you're going to see her?
(Victoras) Where do you
want me to drop you off?
You do know that you don't have
a driver's licence, right?
You should be fine.
(Mathias) Is your mother a serial killer?
Yes.
And she kills mostly children?
Yes.
And now you're going to punish her?
Yes.
What will you do? Kill her?
And then I'll chop her head off
and cut her into pieces!
Yes or no? Concentrate.
Yes!
And then set her car on fire?
Yes!
And burn down the house as well?
Yes.
(Mathias) So what is your mother doing
in Bavaria?
(Victoras) She met a German guy
in Greece six years ago.
She got pregnant
and went to stay with him.
(Mathias) Is it a brother or a sister?
(Victoras) A brother.
(Mathias)
And you didn't keep any contact?
(Victoras) In the beginning,
she was visiting.
I met my brother when he was a baby.
Now she calls me every once in a while.
Every year she sends me
a German learning book with a CD.
This year she sent
a travel guide to Bavaria.
(Mathias)
Why have you never visited them?
(Victoras)
I think your 20 questions are over.
(Mathias) Yes.
No.
Maybe.
(Mathias, in German) Are you tired?
(cockerel crows)
Breakfast?
- The one here is over.
- Hmm.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
Good.
These cost five euros.
Can you believe it?
Five euros for a packet of chips
just because
they're in the middle of nowhere.
Are you out of your mind?
Did you steal them?
(Mathias) No one saw me. Relax.
Are you stupid,
you stole from the gas station?
Did you pay for the gas?
Here's the receipt.
Stop shouting at me.
Chips?
- Stop polluting Mother Nature!
- Shut up!
- You're the crazy one here, man.
- Shut up!
You keep putting me in danger
and then you ask me to trust you!
How the fuck can I trust you?
You know it's my car.
You know I don't have a licence.
And you keep on behaving
like a five-year-old!
"This costs five euros,
can you believe it? Let's steal it!"
Fucking child.
- That's it.
- (indicator ticks)
Leave!
Fuck off!
(wind whistles)
(voice on police radio)
(German folk music on radio)
Um...
(in German) Hello.
Have you...
(in English) Have you seen a young man?
- Um, brown hair? Brown eyes?
- (in German) No.
Ciao.
Ciao.
So where are we going now?
(children's voices)
Are you nervous?
You wanna leave and come back later?
Let's have some fun.
(bell rings)
Is that her?
(in German) No. No. No.
Come in. Come in.
Oh, look. She has a new Audi.
(child) Hello.
(balloon pops)
(in German) I'm sorry. This is my son.
(in Greek)
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
You are here!
I came with a friend.
Mathias, Angeliki. Angeliki, Mathias.
- Hello.
- (in German) Hello. Nice to meet you.
(in Greek)
You already made a friend here?
We came together from Greece.
(Angeliki, in German)
You came from Greece together?
(Mathias) Yes. We came with your car.
- (Angeliki) Which car?
- The Audi.
That piece of crap is still working?
But don't worry,
your son is an amazing driver.
He only got us arrested once.
(laughs) Your friend is funny.
He doesn't speak German.
(in Greek)
So much for all the books I've sent.
Are you hungry?
Should Helga make you a plate?
Helga! Helga!
Helga!
(in German)
Can you bring two plates please?
This is Victoras...
My son.
- And...
- Mathias.
- Mathias.
- Hello.
(Mathias) Hello.
(in Greek)
Did you meet this handsome fellow?
This is our Bjarke.
Amazing breed.
Obedient.
And very expensive!
Patrick... Where is Patrick?
You have to see your brother.
You won't recognise him!
If I'd known you were coming,
we would have celebrated differently.
(in German) Where is my cake?
(in Greek)
Look how much your brother grew up.
(in German)
Patrick, you remember Victoras?
- No!
- You met him in Greece!
How could he remember you?
Helga, let's get the sweets now!
For the kids!
Be careful, Patrick!
(Angeliki, in Greek)
Come outside and meet the others.
Too bad Sasha is not here!
Patrick! Come!
(in English) Nice cake.
Patrick!
(in German) âª Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!
âª Happy birthday, dear Patrick!
Happy birthday to you!
(cheering)
(in English) Let's go.
What? Are you sure?
Shouldn't we at least burn her car?
Now what?
(Victoras mutters)
(starts engine)
(Angeliki) Victoras?
Victoras?
Victoras?
Victoras!
(Bjarke barks)
Victoras, what are you doing?
- (tyres screech)
- (Bjarke whimpers)
(Angeliki) Bjarke!
Stop! Quiet!
(in Greek) Life is very different here.
You get used to it over time.
I'm more responsible now.
You can count on me.
You drove us here drunk.
You hit my dog.
I wanted ...
It's not like this every day.
We have good days and bad.
Sasha is often away for work.
And I've had enough of being alone.
You have Helga.
And Patrick.
And Bjorke.
Bjarke!
I took Patrick to try diving.
He didn't like it at all.
He was afraid.
He didn't jump.
Not even from one metre!
You, when you were little,
you always told me your dream was to fly.
You remember?
This was your dream.
I remember it well.
Your grandmother always said
you should become a pilot.
I said you should take diving lessons.
I wanted to make your dream come true.
You took me diving
because I was restless
and I was getting on your nerves.
I don't remember that.
But if that was the case,
something good came out of it.
Give me a drag.
Do you want to drive?
(Mathias speaks quietly in German)
Will you help me take him inside?
Helga!
(in German)
You must be starving after all this.
(in English) I should get going probably.
(in German) Don't be silly.
You are part of the family.

$&$The prime of Misso Jean Brodie$&$
Morning, girls.
Good morning.
There's Miss Brodie.
Miss Brodie!
Oh, girls, how lovely
to see you. Thank you.
- I've been looking for you all over the place.
- Have you had a nice holiday?
Oh, you wait till
I tell you about Italy.
- Good morning, Miss Brodie.
- Morning, Miss Brodie.
Oh, good morning,
Mr. Lowther, Mr. Lloyd.
- Will you put that upstairs?
- Yes, Miss Brodie.
- Put that on the desk.
- Yes, Miss Brodie.
Come on.
Good morning, Miss Mackay.
You take charge of these two new girls.
Please see that they know what they have to do.
- Yes, Miss Mackay.
- Thank you so much.
- Sheila, there's no need to run.
- No, Miss Mackay.
âª Lord, behold us with Thy blessing

Here comes Miss Brodie.
- Good morning, girls.
- Good morning, Miss Brodie.
You may sit down.
Who opened the window?
Whoever opened the window
has opened it too wide.
Six inches is
perfectly adequate.
More is vulgar.
Forsooth, one should have...
an innate sense of these things,
of what is suitable.
Morag, will you please?
Thank you.
I see we have
two new girls this term.
Will the two new girls
please stand up?
- You are?
- Emily Carstairs, Miss Brodie.
Emily Carstairs.
There.
You are inscribed.
Would you like to tell us
something about yourself, Emily?
I'm a Girl Guide, Miss Brodie.
I have six merit badges.
One for knot tying.
One for flag folding.
- Indeed.
- One...
For those who like that sort of thing,
that is the sort of thing they like.
You may sit down, Emily.
And this is Mary McGregor.
Well, what about you, Mary?
You don't look to me like a girl who ties knots.
N-N-No, Miss Brodie, but my b-b-brother does.
That is as it should be.
But what about you?
What are your interests?
I haven't g-got any.
I d-d-don't think.
That is what I am for,
Mary McGregor...
to provide you with interests.
You may sit down now, Mary.
Little girls, I am in the business
of putting old heads on young shoulders.
All my pupils are
the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me.
Give me a girl
at an impressionable age...
and she is mine for life.
You girls are my vocation.
If I were to receive
a proposal of marriage tomorrow...
from the Lord Lyon, king of arms,
I would decline it.
I am dedicated
to you in my prime.
And my summer in Italy
has convinced me...
that I am truly in my prime.
Emily, Mary McGregor,
you are new to this institution.
It is possible you will hear my teaching
methods decried in certain quarters...
as being unsuitable for a conservative
school like Marcia Blaine.
That is to say, a school dedicated
to the status quo.
Can anyone define "status quo"?
Sandy?
Does it mean staying the same,
Miss Brodie?
Precisely.
Staying the same to the point
of petrification.
P-E-T-R-I-F...
I-C-A-T-I-O-N.
Petrification.
I do not intend to devote
my prime to petrification.
Prop up your books
in case of intruders.
If there are intruders,
we are doing our history.
But we will not do our history.
Can anyone tell me who is
the greatest Italian painter?
Leonardo da Vinci, Miss Brodie.
That is incorrect, Jenny.
The answer is Giotto.
He is my favorite.
Observe, little girls,
Stanley Baldwin...
who got in as prime minister
and got out again ere long.
Our headmistress, Miss Mackay...
retains him on the walls because
she believes in the slogan "safety first".
Safety does not come first.
Goodness, Truth
and Beauty come first.
One's prime brings one's insight
into these things.
One's prime is the moment
one is born for.
You little girls must be
on the alert to recognize your prime...
at whatever time it may occur...
and live it to the full.
"Season of mist
and mellow fruitfulness".
I want to tell you
of a moment in my life...
when I was very young...
younger even
than the man himself.
His name was Hugh.
I fell deeply in love
with Hugh...
in the last year of the war...
but he fell on Flanders field.
Helen McPhee, are you thinking
of doing a day's washing?
- No, Miss Brodie.
- You have your sleeves rolled up.
Roll them down at once.
I won't have to do with girls...
who roll up the sleeves
of their blouses.
We are civilized beings.
He fell on Flanders field.
He fell the week before
armistice was declared.
He fell like an autumn leaf.
Remind me to show you a map of Flanders
and the spot where my lover...
was laid to sleep forever,
before you were born.
"Come autumn so pensive
in yellow and gray...
and soothe me with tidings
of nature's decay".
Robert Burns.
Hugh fell like an autumn leaf.
After the armistice,
people were dancing and singing for joy...
in the streets, but...
Hugh was one of the flowers
of the forest...
lying in his grave.
What seems to be
ailing the spirits of...
Monica Maclaren, isn't it?
Monica cries easily.
Well, Monica, perhaps you can
tell me why you are crying.
She's moved by a story
I have been telling...
of the Battle of Flodden.
Crying over a history lesson?
It is a moving story.
The night before Flodden,
at Mercat Cross beside St. Giles...
a ghostly herald was heard
reading the names...
of all the noble families of Scotland
beginning with the king.
After the battle,
there was not one family...
who had not suffered
grievous loss...
as you well know, Miss Mackay.
To be sure.
Well, girls, I know you're all
going to work hard...
at every subject this year.
A good beginning
makes a good ending.
I hope you all
had splendid holidays...
and I look forward to reading
your splendid essays...
on how you spent them.
You shouldn't be crying
over a history lesson at your age.
My word.
Thank you, Janet.
Good morning, Miss Mackay.
You may sit down, girls.
You did well, Monica,
not to answer the question put to you.
It is well when in difficulties
to say never a word...
neither black nor white.
But you did, Miss Brodie.
You were in difficulty,
and you made up about Flodden.
Sandy, please try to do as I say
and not as I do.
Remember, you are
a child, Sandy...
and far from your prime.
- I hear I must congratulate you on the birth of another child.
- Yes, another daughter.
Have you never heard
of Marie Stopes...
architect for constructive birth control
and racial progress?
Ah, yes. An estimable woman. But my church
enjoins me to go forth and be fruitful.
I'm aware of your unfortunate affiliation
with the Church of Rome.
I doubt, however,
whether that body gives...
the same interpretation
to go forth that you do.
My church understands human imperfection
and forgives it. Why can't you?
I am not interested in human imperfection.
I am interested in Beauty, in Art, in Truth.
In Art and Beauty, maybe.
In truth, no.
This is outrageous!
The truth is that you bounced
into bed with an artist...
...but you were horrified,
when you woke up with a man!
- R-Release me instantly!
- I finished your portrait, Jean.
- Come back to the studio. Come Sunday.
- I can't. I can't.
- Why not?
- I have another engagement!
- Well, break it!
- I can't possibly!
- I'm-I'm... I'm going to Cramond.
- What for?
Mr. Lowther has invited me
to his estate at Cramond.
- Lowther?
- He has a small boat.
I'm invited to go sailing...
on Sunday.
What do you want me to do...
ravish you on the floor...
for the edification
of your girls?
- Here.
- Is this liver paste, Miss Brodie?
It is pÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras.
PÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras.
Oh, it must be marvelous
to be French.
The French have
a genius for food...
but I doubt French women
will ever get the vote.
I was quite emphatic about it.
"I'll not pull my punches, Miss Mackay",
I said.
"Miss Brodie's girls are different".
- Oh, you said that?
- Oh, I said it, all right...
and I meant it.
Thank you, Miss Lockhart.
The Brodie set, indeed.
Wee girls refusing
to wash their faces.
Oh, Miss Brodie,
they informed me...
hasn't washed her face
in 20 years.
She looks clean enough
from here.
Miss Brodie prescribes
cold cream.
She always looks so extreme.
This is my new girl,
Mr. Lowther, Mary McGregor.
Mr. Lowther. There's a great deal
Mr. Lowther can teach you...
about the modulation
of your tones.
Miss Brodie, I thought... that is,
I hoped there might be time...
for a wee cup of tea in the common room
before the afternoon classes.
How nice of you
to ask me, Mr. Lowther.
Now, girls, I leave
Mary McGregor in your charge.
Thank you.
Well, Mary McGregor,
how much pocket money do you get?
O-O-One and six a week.
One and six?
Your father gives you one and six?
M-M-Mr. Ealing
gives it to me.
I don't have
a f-f-father or mother.
- Who's Mr. Ealing?
- At the b-b-bank. He's our guardian.
He takes care of the m-m-money.
Well, I'd like to be an orphan heiress
and get my pocket money...
from bankers that
don't know any better.
Does your brother
get one and six too?
I d-d-don't know.
He's 14.
My b-b-brother has run away...
from four schools.
Your brother sounds
like a bad lot.
So I thought that this Sunday...
I would treat myself
to one last day...
of sun and water.
I wonder, Mr. Lowther,
if you might be able to help me.
- In what way, Miss Brodie?
- Why, you might know if there's any possibility...
of my renting
a little boat at Cramond.
Oh, well, Miss Brodie,
I have a boat.
Oh, do you, Mr. Lowther?
It would give me
the greatest pleasure, uh...
I mean, i-if you would consider
coming with me.
Oh, but I couldn't
trouble you, Mr. Lowther.
Trouble? Oh, Miss Brodie,
I would have asked you before many times...
but I... I didn't want
to seem to push myself.
Please, Miss Brodie,
say you'll come with me.
Very well, Mr. Lowther.
On Sunday?
On Sunday.
After church, of course.
Oh, of course, Mr. Lowther.
Do you think Mr. Lloyd
is the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me...
or Mr. Lowther?
Neither. It's us.
"Little girls, if you will
only listen to me...
I will make of you
the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me."
My father says these are
the happiest days of our lives.
But if these are supposed
to be the happiest...
why does Miss Brodie
say prime is best?
Miss Brodie never got married
like our mothers and fathers.
- They don't have primes.
- They have sexual intercourse.
- Oh, I don't like to think about it.
- You don't have to.
It happens on
the spur of the moment.
You lead.
- How do you know?
- About what?
What you were saying... about how sexual
intercourse happens on the spur of the moment.
Because it happened to Teenie,
that works in my father's shop...
when she was out walking
at Puddocky with her boyfriend.
They had to get married.
You'd think the urge would have passed
by the time they'd got their clothes off.
Yes. That's what
I can't understand.
People take their clothes off
in front of each other.
It's so rude.
They're bound to be
put off their passion.
Do you think Miss Brodie
ever had sexual intercourse...
with Hugh of Flanders field...
before he fell?
I don't know.
I don't think
they did anything like that.
Their love was above all that.
Well, Miss Brodie said
they clung to each other...
with passionate abandon
on his last leave.
I don't think they took
their clothes off though. Do you?
No. I can't see it.
Observe, little girls,
the castle.
It is built on a rock
of volcanic plug.
It was through
one of yon windows...
that Mary, Queen of Scots
lowered her infant son...
straight down 187 feet
in a basket in a high wind.
Mary McGregor, will you please
do up your shoelace?
Oh. Observe the litter.
In Italy, Mussolini has put an end
to litter in the streets.
Do any of you little girls remember what
the followers of Mussolini are called?
- Fascisti.
- That is correct. F-A-S-C-I-S-T-I.
Fascisti.
And Mussolini is called?
- "Dukee".
- Il Duce. That is to say, the leader.
Il Duce.
We move on.
Straighten your shoulders,
Mary McGregor.
All you girls must learn to
walk with your heads up, up...
like Sybil Thorndike,
a woman of noble mean.
In the Kirk of the Greyfriars...
on the 20th day
of February, 1638...
the people of Scotland
pledged themselves...
to the Presbyterian faith.
Many of them used their own blood
to sign the covenant.
- Ew.
- This part of Edinburgh is very rich in history.
It is very romantic.
So you see, little girls,
you must always remember...
you are citizens of Edinburgh,
city of Hume and Boswell.
You are Europeans,
not dowdy provincials.
- Sandy, what on earth are you doing?
- Walking like Sybil Thorndike.
You know, one day, Sandy,
one day you will go too far.
- Hello.
- Oh, Mr. Lloyd.
Girls, you know Mr. Lloyd, the art master
from the senior school.
- Yes.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Lloyd.
- Good afternoon, girls.
- Mr. Lloyd has his studio somewhere in this neighborhood.
Number six... fourth floor, front.
The door's always open.
I've been giving my girls an outing.
We've been to the gallery.
I've been telling them
the story of Gauguin.
Ah, the dangerous Miss Brodie.
By whom, pray,
am I considered to be dangerous?
It is the consensus.
Your girls are said to be vastly informed...
in subjects irrelevant
to the accepted curriculum.
Most heinous of all,
you are said to inculcate no team spirit.
Is that true, girls?
Does Miss Brodie incite you
to shirk your duties on the hockey field?
Phrases like the "team spirit" are always
employed to cut across individualism.
Cleopatra knew nothing of the team spirit,
if you read your Shakespeare.
And where would the team spirit
have got Anna Pavlova?
She is the prima ballerina.
It is the corps de ballet
that had the team spirit.
Oh, Miss Brodie,
you are dangerous.
Mm-hmm. Yes.
We must away and catch our tram.
I doubt we will get seats.
It is 1932, and chivalry is dead.
Miss Brodie?
I do want you to come and see
the picture, the one I told you about.
What about next weekend?
- No. I'm afraid I'm going...
- Going to Cramond?
Why, yes. My girls and I spend nearly
every weekend at Cramond.
Mr. Lowther
is most hospitable.
Good afternoon,
Mr. Lloyd.
Come along, girls.
Got it!
There we are.
- Oh, there's some nice ones up here.
- No. Get one.
- I'm watching. It's all right.
- Watch out.
Thank you.
Crepe de Chine.
Miss Brodie's legs
are longer than Mr. Lowther's.
She'd have to
wrap hers around his.
First he puts out the light.
Then their toes touch.
Then...
"Miss Brodie, Miss Brodie".
Miss Brodie says, "Darling".
- She says...
- "Mr. Lowther...
you are the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me".
We will have to watch
Miss Brodie's stomach.
It is the curve
I am attempting to introduce you to.
The curve here in this drape...
and here, and here in the arm.
The curve flows through
a painting like a river.
It is sinuous, sensuous...
epitomizing everything
that is female.
The curve is a beckoning line...
here, and here.
And here, in the breast.
And the belly!
And the buttocks!
Shut up!
Go on.
Get along with you.
Go to your sewing classes and your
singing lessons. It's all you deserve.
"They flee from me...
who once did seek me out".
I miss you, Jean.
Shall I beg you?
Please, come back.
You have a family.
I am a teacher.
I had a family last June.
You were a teacher last June.
My God. I wish I had a pound note
for every time I've heard you say...
"I am a teacher. I am a teacher.
First, last and always".
What a firm reminder
your postcard was.
A postcard from romantic Italy.
The incomparable
Giotto frescoes...
How triumphantly his figures vibrate
with life. Yours truly, J. Brodie...
A postcard from my passionate,
abandoned inamorata.
That night at the studio...
that one night at the studio...
I was pleased to feel it was I
who enjoyed the tutorial position.
Come back, Jean.
I need you.
Mary McGregor!
Mary McGregor, do you know
what happened to Peeping Tom?
His eyes were shriveled
into darkness in his head...
and dropped before him!
Poor old Tom.
Don't worry, Jean. You've got your girls
well trained. You're safe from that quarter.
It's me you've got
to worry about.
Come to the studio.
Come to pose again.
- Only to pose.
- You should paint one of my girls.
- Jenny is the pretty one.
- Hang your girls. It's you I want to paint.
I will not come to the studio.
Then to hell with you!
Teddy, you know,
you really should paint Jenny.
You'd like Jenny.
She has a profile...
of deceptive purity.
What's the matter with you, Mary?
What's happened to you?
Your face is all funny.
N-No, it's not.
Yes, it is, Mary.
Very funny.
So is your voice.
Well, well.
Miss Brodie's brood, I presume.
Yes, Mr. Lloyd.
- Would you like a rosebud?
- A what?
It's the favorite sweet
of little Princess Margaret Rose.
Unmistakably Brodie.
And you, I suppose,
are the pretty one.
Good afternoon, girls.
Mary, you're definitely
upset about something.
- N-No.
- Tell! Tell, or I'll pinch you.
- Tell.
- No, I w-won't tell.
I love Miss Brodie,
and I won't t-tell.
What about Miss Brodie?
Tell, or we'll take you
into the locker room...
- and hang you over the banisters.
- You wouldn't d-dare.
- Tell!
- It's n-none of your b-b-business!
No! Stop!
Get your hands off of me! Help!
- Let go of me!
- Aaah! No!
If you scream again...
we'll drop you squoosh
on your silly head.
Mary, dear, if something's happened
with Miss Brodie, you should tell me.
- What have you done?
- She was s-so angry!
Well, you know
how you are, Mary.
- What have you done now?
- Nothing.
I j-j-just went in.
- In where?
- The classroom!
So?
There they were!
- There who were?
- Oh, Mr. Lowther.!
Miss Brodie
and Mr. Lowther.!
No! M-M-Mr. Lloyd!
They were kissing!
Kissing?
I saw them k-k-kissing...
together.
- He had his arms around her.
- Mr. Lloyd!
Mr. Lloyd! Mr. Lloyd's
in love with Miss Brodie!
And she's in I-love
with M-Mr. Lloyd.
You should have s-seen them.
But what about
Mr. Lowther then?
Mr. Lloyd is an artist.
And Miss Brodie's artistic too.
Miss Brodie's really in love with
Mr. Lloyd, but he's married to another...
so she's working it off
on Mr. Lowther.
- Oh.
- Let's go home.
Listen, Mary.
Was it a long, lingering kiss?
I shouldn't have t-told you.
But since you did,
was it a long, lingering kiss?
- Yes.
- I see.
- Didn't they hear you?
- I d-don't think so.
They jumped apart though.
You mean,
they sensed your presence?
I d-d-don't know.
Was it like this...
That's it! That's it!
It's nearly 5:00. Time you girls were away.
What were you doing, Sandy?
- Just playacting, Miss Mackay.
- Playacting at what?
- Opera.
- Opera?
Yes, Miss Mackay.
We've been studying Traviata.
Sandy, show me
what you were doing.
Go on. Show me.
That's enough, Sandy.
She was doing Violetta
expiring for love of Alfredo.
- It's very sad.
- Oh, nonsense.
Violetta did not expire
for love of Alfredo.
Violetta was a thoroughly silly woman
with diseased lungs.
If she'd been properly
brought up...
she'd have been out on the hockey field,
breathing deeply.
Which is precisely what
you little girls should be doing.
Traviata is not
on the Marcia Blaine curriculum.
But Miss Brodie and Mr. Lowther
took us to see Traviata...
when the Carl Rosa Company
came to Edinburgh.
Miss Brodie and Mr. Lowther
took you to the opera?
Mr. Lowther's jolly nice.
We go to visit him at Cramond too.
When Miss Brodie goes...
on weekends.
How very nice
of Mr. Lowther...
and Miss Brodie.
I hope you're appreciative.
My, my. Miss Brodie's very musical,
I believe...
theaters, concerts
and the opera.
Miss Brodie is very musical.
I think Miss Brodie's
more interested in art, Miss Mackay.
Now, what makes you think
Miss Brodie prefers art to music, Sandy?
She told us so.
Music is an interest to her,
but painting is a passion.
Miss Brodie said.
- A passion?
- Compared to music.
Well, Mary...
I'm sure you're too young
to have passions.
- What are your cultural interests?
- Stories.
Does Miss Brodie
tell you stories?
Oh, yes.
L-L-Love...
Lovely stories.
- Stories like Traviata?
- Stories of history.
- History.
- She makes history seem like the cinema.
- No. Not the cinema. More like Shakespeare.
- Shakespeare.
Indeed.
My, what would we do
without Miss Brodie?
I could wish
your arithmetic papers were better.
Culture is no compensation
for lack of hard knowledge.
I'm happy to see you are devoted
to Miss Brodie.
Your loyalty is also
due to the school.
I'm always impressed
by Miss Brodie's girls...
in one way or another.
Benito Mussolini is a great man.
He began life as a journalist...
a man of learning,
an intellectual...
but he is also a man of action.
He has made Capri
into a sanctuary for birds.
A simple act of goodness.
If you all turn to page 25 of your
geography books, you'll find a map of Capri.
It's off the coast of Naples.
It is because of Il Duce
thousands of birds live and sing there today...
that might well have ended
their careers on a piece of toast.
Miss Gaunt,
is there something you wanted?
Thank you.
"Dear Miss Brodie,
I hope it will be convenient for you...
"to see me in my office
this afternoon at 4:15.
Emmaline Mackay".
4:15. Not 4:00.
Not 4:30, but 4:15.
She thinks to intimidate me,
by the use of quarter hours.
Now, as I was
attempting to say...
Benito Mussolini
is indeed a man of action.
Come in.
4:15. I was afraid
I might be late, or early.
Not at all.
You are most punctilious.
Thank you for finding the time.
I know how busy
your girls keep you.
- Please, sit down.
- Oh. Thank you.
What a colorful frock.
Color enlivens the spirit,
does it not?
Perhaps you're right, though I wonder
if the spirits of the girls need enlivening.
Oh, indeed they do!
My credo is,
"Lift, enliven, stimulate"
No doubt.
But the Marcia Blaine School...
is essentially
a conservative school.
We do not encourage
the, uh, progressive attitudes.
Now, Miss Brodie,
I have noticed...
a spirit of precocity among your girls...
your special girls.
- Why, thank you.
- Oh.
I am in my prime...
and my girls are
benefiting from it.
I'm proud to think that perhaps
my girls are more aware.
- Precisely. Now...
- To me, education is a leading out.
The word education comes
from the root "ex", meaning "out",
and "duco": "I lead".
To me, education is simply a...
a leading out...
of what is already there.
I had hoped there might also be
a certain amount of putting in.
That would not be education,
but intrusion...
from the root prefix "in",
meaning "in",
and the stem "trudo": "I thrust".
Ergo, to thrust a lot
of information into a pupil's head.
To discuss education with such
a dedicated teacher...
is always instructive.
However, it was not for that reason
I asked you to come here.
Miss Brodie...
I am told that you make
weekly expeditions to Cramond.
Yes. Isn't it
a lovely spot?
It is, indeed.
I believe Mr. Lowther inherited
the estate from his mother.
He's lived there all his life.
Mr. Lowther is not
a worldly man...
not a reckless man.
It is doubtful whether he would
recognize recklessness in others.
And recklessness
is an indulgence...
that we at Marcia Blaine
must eschew...
not only within our walls,
but in the personal life...
the conduct, as it were,
of the teaching staff.
Oh, Miss Mackay...
I do not believe I have
ever fully appreciated...
the taxing load of trivia...
with which a headmistress
must concern herself.
I must concern myself, Miss Brodie,
with this school's board of governors.
I flatter myself that I am not
unknown to the board...
having been a member
of the staff of Marcia Blaine...
six years prior
to your engagement, Miss Mackay.
I feel quite safe in saying...
that no member of the board
has ever shown anything...
but appreciation and approval
of my teaching methods.
Oh! Oh, Miss Mackay...
I use the woods of Cramond
for lessons in botany...
the rocks of the shore to investigate
the mysteries of geology.
It should be patently clear
that my expeditions to Cramond...
are expeditions for enrichment.
Enrichment for my girls...
and for Marcia Blaine.
Well.
Thank you, Miss Brodie.
I feel sure you and I have come
to understand each other better.
I'm always
at your command, Miss Mackay.
I am delighted to hear it.
Good day, Miss Brodie.
Oh, chrysanthemums.
Such serviceable flowers.
May I have a word with you,
Miss Gaunt?
Miss Gaunt, you are, of course,
aware of the problem...
when a teacher has tenure
and the loyalty of her pupils.
It's not going to
be easy, Miss Gaunt.
However, no doubt,
in due time...
some advantage will
be vouchsafed us.
In the meanwhile, I would deem it
a sincere service to the school...
if any indiscretion
that might reach your ears...
should also reach mine.
Also, your brother...
is a deacon of Cramond Kirk,
is he not...
and naturally eager
to preserve its sanctity?
Thank you, Miss Gaunt.
What are you writing?
"My dear, delightful Gordon...
your letter has moved me deeply,
as you may imagine.
But, alas, I must ever decline
to be Mrs. Lowther.
My reasons are twofold...
I am dedicated to my girls,
as is madame Pavlova...
and there is another in my life.
He is Teddy Lloyd...
Here. Let me. Let me.
"But we can still have...
many a breezy day
in the fishing boat...
at sea...
- Shh!
- What are you two girls up to?
Gather your things together,
and leave at once.
This is a library,
not a fun fair!
- Are those your books?
- No, Miss McKenzie.
I want you to remember, girls...
that it is
of primary importance...
that the upper
and lower tensions...
are perfectly even.
And secondly, girls,
it is most important...
to ensure that you are using...
the correct length of stitch.
If we were to fill this room
with the hydrogen being made in these jars...
and then strike a match...
there'd be an explosion large enough
to reduce this building to rubble.
Look. I'll show you.
âª Hey, Johnnie Cope
are ye waukin' yet
âª Or are your drums
a-beatin' yet
âª If ye were waukin'
I wad wait
âª To gang to the coals
in the mornin'
All together now.
âª Hey, Johnnie Cope
are ye waukin' yet
âª Or are your drums
a-beatin' yet
âª If ye were waukin'
I wad wait
âª To gang to the coals
in the mornin'
The sun!
Forsooth, we are renewed.
Refreshment alfresco.
Enough to go round,
but the lion's share for Mr. Lowther.
This term, I have sworn
to fatten Mr. Lowther...
by a full half-stone.
That is my pledge.
Did I neglect to tell you girls that once,
on leave from the war...
Hugh took me out sailing
on a fishing boat.
We spent our happiest times among
the rocks and pebbles of a small seaport.
Sometimes Hugh would sing.
He had a rich tenor voice.
At other times, he would set up
his easel and paint.
Hugh was very talented
in both arts...
but I think...
I think the painter
was the real Hugh.
But you girls are my life now.
I am the potter,
and you are my pride.
You are shaping up.
Soon you will graduate
to the senior school...
and I will no longer
teach you...
but you will always be
Brodie girls.
Ah! Here comes
our Mr. Lowther.
"Our minstrel sweet,
oh, synge unto me roundelaie.
Oh, droppe
the brynie tear with me.
De da de da de da de da
and like a running river be...
Now, Mr. Lowther, you must
cooperate with the fattening project.
It will enrich your voice.
Caruso had the appetite of a giant.
What good care you take of me.
âª La, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la la-la
I was noticed at the theater.
I was noticed and reported
to Mr. Gaunt.
Mr. Gaunt?
Oh, that deacon at Cramond.
Whatever for?
Well, he considered
Hedda Gabler...
Well, he said
that the choirmaster of his church...
had no business attending that sort of thing
with an unmarried lady and children.
O-Oh, I defended myself...
fiercely.
Girls, as you hear,
there's now been an attempt...
to persecute Mr. Lowther
on our account.
One must never succumb
to provincial ignorance.
Mr. Lowther did not...
nor shall anyone
under my tutelage.
Now, eat up, Mr. Lowther.
What is it, Sandy?
Miss Mackay is watching us
from her window.
Oh, indeed.
I wonder how many more picnics
we will be allowed...
before Miss Mackay thinks
fit to patrol the grounds.
It is Miss Mackay's hope to harass me...
into leaving Marcia Blaine.
Miss Gaunt
and certain teachers...
have taken to bidding me good morning
with predestination in their smiles.
Do you really think
Miss Mackay wants to drive you away?
It doesn't signify
what Miss Mackay wants.
Here I am, and here I stay.
I would not leave you girls for the Lord...
Lyon, king of arms.
Not even he! I shall remain
in this education factory...
where my duty lies.
If they want to get rid of me,
they'll have to...
...assassinate me!
Now, eat up, Mr. Lowther.
Cooperation is the keynote. Now, Jenny,
do us a cartwheel for comic relief.
- Oh! Wonderful!
- Bravo. Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo! Oh.
- Oh.
- These are my girls, Mr. Lowther.
Forsooth, they are Brodie girls.
Monica...
Monica is histrionic.
She will perform in plays...
or perhaps write them.
Mary...
our Mary is alone in this world.
Her needs are great,
but she has me.
Mary will stop stuttering.
She will brisk up.
Mary McGregor will
distinguish herself for me.
I have no doubt.
Then there is Jenny.
Sometimes I feel there is
a spiritual bond...
between Jenny and me.
I don't expect Jenny feels this yet,
but someday she will.
And Sandy...
...Sandy is...
- ...Sandy is dependable.
- Oh, Sandy.
Sandy is very dependable.
Now, Monica,
recite for us, please.
What shall I recite,
Miss Brodie?
Something...
Something of magic.
"There she weaves
by night and day...
a magic web with colors gay.
She has heard a whisper say...
a curse is on her if she stay...
to look down on Camelot.
She knows not what
the curse may be...
Mr. Lowther,
the Philistines are upon us.
She knows not what
the curse may be...
and so she weaveth steadily...
and little
other care hath she...
the Lady of Shalott.
But in her web,
she still delights...
to weave the mirror's
magic sights...
for often through
the silent nights...
a funeral with plumes
and lights and music...
went to Camelot...
or when the moon was overhead...
came two young lovers
lately wed.
I am half sick of shadows,
said the Lady of Shalott.
The Lady of Shalott.
I think perhaps someday...
Jenny will catch the eye
of an artist.
Jenny will be
painted many times.
In years to come...
I think that Jenny
will be famous...
for...
sex.
Well, Monica,
what do you think of it?
It makes her look
very... mature.
I am very mature.
We're all mature.
Some people at the school
think you're too mature.
Everyone's jealous.
They know the Brodie set
has more fun than anyone else.
We go places, and we do things.
And now you've taken to
hanging around an artist's studio.
- Very glamorous.
- Miss Brodie's g-g-glamorous, don't you think?
Mr. Lowther thinks she is.
Sandy's awfully late.
Do you think she's coming?
Three years of Cramond
and Mr. Lowther.
- What stamina.
- There's always lovely food at Cramond.
Lasagna Verde.
Sweetbreads Ã  la Milanese.
"Harlot" russe.
Charlotte russe.
Miss Brodie takes good care
of Mr. Lowther.
- What does Mr. Lowther do for Miss Brodie?
- He sings to her.
Put that wet thing over there.
Mary, for the third time
this afternoon...
- will you get out of the way?
- Sorry.
Mary McGregor.
Well, Mary, what's new on the Rialto?
What's new with your brother?
How's he progressing
up at Oxford?
His t-t-tutor caught fire.
Caught fire?
His tutor?
- Well, how? From what?
- From my brother.
Your brother set fire
to the tutor?
Your brother should be put
in a house of correction.
It makes me look very mature.
It makes you look
like Miss Brodie.
All the sketches of Jenny do too.
They all look like Miss Brodie.
- I think they do.
- Ew.!
I painted that chap
in my student days.
It's what's called
a "life study".
I had a difficult time
with the pectoral muscles.
Pectoral?
- Chest.
- Oh.
- Oh, Monica!
- What?
Miss Brodie says that anyone
of a cultured home and heritage...
- makes no fuss about the human body.
- Who's making any fuss?
- You are.
- I have as much heritage as you do any day.
I think that's enough for today.
If I keep on,
I shall ruin the mouth...
and that would be a pity.
- What do you think?
- Well, uh, I think that it's...
- It's...
- Miss Brodie says that Jenny will be painted many times.
- And what does she say about you?
- That I am dependable.
When should I come back?
Whenever you have time.
Come next Saturday.
- All right. Come on, Sandy. I'm starving.
- I can't come with you.
- I've got to meet my mother.
- Oh, your eternal mother!
- Good-bye, girls.
- Bye, Mr. Lloyd.
- My feet are wet.
- Take your shoes off then, silly.
Dry them by the stove.
I'll make some tea.
- Aren't there any more biscuits?
- No, that's the lot.
I'm not up to
Cramond standards, I fear.
Lasagna Verde, "harlot" russe.
A wonder all that rich food
doesn't give old Lowther a stoppage.
He eats his greens.
Do you paint portraits
of your own children too?
Is that your wife?
That's my wife.
Her name is Deirdre.
Is she in her prime?
Perhaps not quite yet.
One day, I'd like to paint
all you Brodie girls.
It'd be interesting to see what sort
of group I can make of you.
We'd all look like
one great big Brodie I suppose.
You're a clever little cat,
aren't you?
That will teach you to look
at an artist like that.
Don't you want
the rest of your things?
Can't have you running through
the streets like a wee whore.
Oh, there's Sandy!
Sandy!
Sandy.!
Sandy, dear.!
Hello, Miss Brodie,
Mr. Lowther.
Whatever are you
doing in this neighborhood?
Mr. Lowther and I have been shopping
for tomorrow's lunch.
Thank goodness we can still have
our Sunday lunch at Cramond.
I can't tell you how much I miss
having you girls in my class this year.
We miss you too, Miss Brodie.
Tomorrow, I must tell you girls
of a new plot Miss Mackay has...
to force me to apply for a post at a
progressive... that is to say a crank... school.
But I shall stay at Marcia Blaine
where my duty lies.
- If they want to get rid of me, they will have to...
- Assassinate you.
Precisely. I thought you were to attend
some social gathering with Jenny.
- Where is Jenny?
- She went on home ahead of me.
- I stayed at the studio...
- The studio?
She... Uh,
Jenny just left, you see.
Mr. Lloyd's studio.
Whatever were you doing there?
It was supposed
to be a surprise.
Jenny is sitting
for Mr. Lloyd.
Jenny is sitting
for Mr. Lloyd...
And I wasn't...
When did this begin?
- At the start of term. I shouldn't have told you.
- Jean...
Oh, I'm very glad
you did tell me, Sandy.
You are developing into a girl
of great insight.
- Thank you, Miss Brodie.
- You know, Sandy...
I would be very interested to hear
your own impressions of Jenny's portrait.
But we won't discuss it
with the others.
So Monday, after school,
you'll come to my flat for tea.
We'll have a nice,
quiet time together.
Yes, Miss Brodie.
Well, come now. I'm sure
Mr. Lowther will take you home.
In you get, Sandy.
Can you manage, dear?
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you, Gordon.
- You're very kind.
- Oh, you're more than welcome.
It's a painting
of Mr. Lloyd's family.
It starts with himself
and his wife...
and then all the children graded downwards
to the baby and the dog on the floor.
It's supposed to be funny...
but the funniest part is,
they all look like you.
Like me?
Yes. Even the baby.
Everybody he paints
looks like you.
You shall butter the scones,
Sandy, dear.
Be generous.
Uh, does the portrait
of Jenny look like me?
Oh, yes.
Mr. Lloyd might want
to paint me too.
I doubt if having your portrait painted
is going to be your career.
Would you mind shutting the window, dear?
There's a wee bit of a draft.
What do you think
it will be, Miss Brodie?
Uh, what do I think
what will be?
My career.
Well, you're quite
intelligent, of course.
Actually, Sandy, you have
something more than mere intelligence.
You have insight.
There goes Miss Lockhart.
The chemistry teacher?
Yes. She's got
her golf clubs.
Monica saw Mr. Lowther
playing golf with Miss Lockhart...
twice.
Indeed?
Well, I know very little
of, uh, Miss Lockhart.
I leave her
to her jars and gases.
We were talking
about your insight, Sandy.
You do have insight...
and Jenny...
has got instinct.
Jenny will be a great lover.
She's like a heroine from a novel
by Mr. D.H. Lawrence.
The common moral code will not
apply to her. She will be above it.
This is a fact which only someone
with your insight should know about.
You know, Sandy...
you would make an excellent
secret service agent...
a great spy.
Sandy, you must try
not to peer at people.
It makes a most rude impression.
Why do you think I would
make a good spy, Miss Brodie?
Well, because you are intelligent
and not... emotional.
I've observed this
constraint in you.
It has, from time to time,
distressed me...
as I myself am a...
deeply emotional woman.
I feel many things passionately.
I feel things, Miss Brodie.
Well, everybody does, of course.
It's simply a matter of degree.
Actually, passion would be
a great handicap to a spy.
- It would?
- Definitely.
What did you mean
when you said that, uh...
Jenny was above
the common moral code?
Oh, simply that it
will not apply to her.
She is the exception...
and we can help Jenny
to realize this.
- Oh, Sandy, dear, I forgot the hot water.
- I'll get it.
Thank you, dear.
Miss Brodie, how do you think
that we can help Jenny?
We can encourage her,
give her confidence.
Confidence for what?
For when she is 18.
With a girl like Jenny...
perhaps even 17.
Soon she will...
know love.
Do you understand that, Sandy?
You mean she'll have affairs...
love affairs.
Oh, Sandy, you do have insight.
I am never wrong.
I can always depend on you.
Little girls, you must all learn
to cultivate an expression of composure.
It is one of
the greatest assets of a woman...
an expression of composure,
come foul, come fair.
Regard the Mona Lisa.
She's older than the rocks
on which she sits.
Whom did I say to regard, Clara?
The Mona Lisa, Miss Brodie.
That is correct.
Clara has artistic tendencies.
Little girls, I am in the business of putting
old heads on young shoulders.
And all my pupils
are the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me.
Jean!
Oh, Jean!
- Mr. Lowther!
- Jean... Uh...
Miss Brodie. Miss Mackay. I've just left her.
I don't know what to do.
Did you wish to speak
to me about something?
What can you be up to, Gordon?
Such a display
in front of the children.
It's Miss Mackay.
She dismissed my class!
She's found something terrible!
Something incriminating!
She demands to see us
both together immediately! Immediately.
I am not accustomed to being
summoned immediately. Not by anyone.
But, Jean, she sent me to get you!
She said now.
Please!
Pull yourself together, Gordon.
I promise I won't let
Miss Mackay stand you in the corner.
Just you wait there a minute.
Well, your headmistress,
Miss Mackay...
wishes to see me
for a few minutes.
She has a wee problem
she wishes to discuss with me.
Now, what subject were we doing?
- History, Miss Brodie.
- Oh, yes.
Open your history books.
While I'm away from the room...
you will all read the chapter on
the succession of the Stuarts.
You will sit quietly in your seats
and remain composed...
like the Mona Lisa.
Miss Brodie, do you
know what this is?
It would appear to be a piece of blue paper
with writing on it in pencil.
It is, in fact, a letter.
It was found by Miss McKenzie
in a library book.
She glanced at it, but after the first
sentence, she dared not actually read it.
She brought it instantly to me.
Yes.
Is it addressed to you?
No, Miss Brodie.
It's addressed to Mr. Lowther...
but it is signed by you.
- I shall begin.
- Oh, please do.
Of course, I realize
it is a forgery...
just the work of a child.
"My dear, delightful Gordon...
your letter has moved me deeply,
as you may imagine...
but, alas, I must ever decline
to be Mrs. Lowther.
My reasons are twofold.
I am dedicated to my girls...
as is madame Pavlova...
and there is another in my life...
he is Teddy Lloyd.
Intimacy has never taken place with him.
He is married to another.
We are not lovers,
but we know the truth.
However, I was proud of giving myself to you
when you came and took me...
in the bracken while
the storm raged about us.
If I am in
a certain condition...
I shall place the infant in the care
of a worthy shepherd and his wife.
I may permit misconduct to occur again
from time to time as an outlet...
because I am in my prime.
We can also have many a... breezy day
in the fishing boat at sea.
We must keep a sharp lookout for Miss Mackay,
however, as she's rather narrow...
which arises from an ignorance of culture
and the Italian scene.
I love to hear you singing
"Hey, Johnny Cope".
But were I to receive
a proposal of marriage tomorrow...
from the Lord Lyon, king of arms,
I would decline it.
Allow me, in conclusion...
to congratulate you warmly on your
sexual intercourse as well as your singing.
With fondest joy, Jean Brodie...
Is this what your girls,
your set...
has learned under your auspices,
Miss Brodie?
It's a literary collaboration.
Two separate hands are involved.
One of the authors
slants her tail consonants...
in an unorthodox manner,
and the other does not.
Also, the paper seems
somewhat aged.
Is that all you have to say?
What else is there to say?
Two little girls at the age
of budding sexual fantasy...
have concocted a romance
for themselves.
They've chosen me as a romantic symbol.
Is that so surprising?
Do you deny that you encourage
these fantasies, as you call them?
Do you deny that by consorting openly
with Mr. Lowther of Cramond...
you lead these poor children
into the most fevered conclusions?
Not only Mr. Lowther, but Mr. Lloyd
is brought into the circle of fire.
Mr. Lloyd, who has
a wife and... six children.
It is diabolic that infants should
be knowledgeable...
12-year-old girls
are not infants, Miss Mackay.
- How do you know they're 12 years old?
- From the handwriting...
the vocabulary, the rudimentary
knowledge of the facts of life.
Oh, surely you cannot believe that that is
the work of 9-year-olds?
I could believe it was the work
of your 9-year-olds, Miss Brodie.
There's very little
for me to say, Miss Mackay...
in the face of your
extraordinary prejudice and hostility.
Miss Brodie, I am not
asking you to say anything.
I am asking... demanding...
that you put your signature,
your own signature...
on a letter of resignation
which I have prepared for you.
I will not resign.
If you will not resign,
you will force me to dismiss you.
I will not resign...
and you will not dismiss me,
Miss Mackay.
You will not use
the excuse of that pathetic...
that humorous document
to blackmail me!
Mr. Lowther,
you are a witness to this.
Miss Mackay has made totally unsupported
accusations against my name and yours.
If she has one
authentic shred of evidence...
just one,
let her bring it forth!
Otherwise, if one more word of this
outrageous calumny reaches my ears, I shall sue!
I shall take Miss Mackay
to the public courts...
and I shall sue the trustees of
Marcia Blaine, if they support her.
I will not stand quietly by
and allow myself to be crucified...
by a woman whose fetid frustration
has overcome her judgment!
If scandal is to your taste,
Miss Mackay, I shall give you a feast!
- Miss Brodie!
- I am a teacher!
I am a teacher,
first, last, always!
Do you imagine
that for one instant...
I will let that be taken
from me without a fight?
I have dedicated, sacrificed
my life to this profession.
And I will not stand by
like an inky little slacker...
and watch you rob me
of it and for what?
For what reason?
For jealousy!
Because I have the gift
of claiming girls for my own.
It is true I am
a strong influence on my girls.
I am proud of it!
I influence them to be
aware of all the possibilities of life...
of beauty, honor, courage.
I do not, Miss Mackay, influence them
to look for slime where it does not exist!
I am going.
When my class convenes,
my pupils will find me composed...
and prepared to reveal to them
the succession of the Stuarts.
And on Sunday, I will go to Cramond
to visit Mr. Lowther.
We are accustomed,
bachelor and spinster...
to spend our Sundays together
in sailing and walking the beaches...
and in the pursuit of music.
Mr. Lowther is teaching me
to play the mandolin.
Good day, Miss Mackay.
Uh, Mr. Lowther...
I am sure I need not
suggest to you that we keep...
the details of Miss Brodie's
little... tantrum to ourselves.
- Yes...
- I've no doubt that you, as well as I...
- have her interests at heart.
- Well, I...
Thank you,
Mr. Lowther.
No doubt you have
other duties to attend to.
Oh, yes. Yes, Miss Mackay.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Jean!
Jean, you were heroic!
Heroic!
Oh, to see you like that,
it was really inspiring!
If only I could have stood up
like that to Mr. Gaunt, if I said...
"Look here, Mr. Gaunt. If you have
one authentic shred of evidence, just one..."
- What are you talking about?
- Mr. Gaunt called to see me the night before last.
He advised me to resign as organist
and elder of the church. He spoke plainly.
And what did you answer?
I resigned.
And you allowed this
evil-minded man...
a man who uses his position
as deacon of the Kirk...
to receive the slanderous gossip
of petty provincials...
But Jean, it isn't just gossip.
You do not go home
on Sunday nights.
They had no proof!
None whatever.
You should have refused
point-blank to resign.
Can't you see that resignation
is tantamount to a confession of guilt.
- But I feel guilty.
- Well, I do not!
Will you not marry me and put an end
to all this sneaking about?
- Why won't you marry me?
- Only yesterday...
it was told to my face that you are planning
to marry the chemistry teacher.
Oh, I... I played golf
with Miss Lockhart once.
- Twice.
- Twice?
Beware.
Don't trifle with her.
She has the means
to blow us all up.
Now, don't tease me, Jean.
Miss Lockhart means nothing to me.
You know all I care about is you.
All I want is to see you happy and safe.
I don't understand you, Jean.
You will not marry me,
yet you feed me and share my bed.
"Share your bed"!
Why can't you say you are my lover?
I do not want
to be your lover...
I want to be your husband.
I want to go on my honeymoon where my mother
and father went on their honeymoon...
and come back to Cramond
with my bride.
That's what I want.
And I want to conduct
the church choir too.
Rumors are flying.
Are you out?
Hmph! On the contrary,
Miss Mackay experienced...
the utmost difficulty
in persuading me to stay.
How I wish I might have heard her plea.
The utmost difficulty.
You've been painting Jenny.
- Yes, that's right.
- I am glad, very glad.
She's getting more beautiful each year.
She quite amazes me.
You see it too.
You're an artist.
You see things other men don't see.
You must see it.
Jenny's quite a pretty girl.
Pretty? No, no.
It's much more than that.
She has... extraordinary
physical instincts...
Primitive and free.
Primitive?
Little Jenny?
What are you up to, Jean?
I'm only trying to tell you
I've always felt that Jenny...
could be
magnificently elevated...
above the ordinary rung
of lovers.
What are you talking about?
It's just that I've
always known that one day...
you would paint Jenny.
Paint Jenny?
Jean, I think you're quite aware
of what you're doing.
You're trying to put that child
in my bed in your place.
Don't be disgusting!
It's only the words that disgust you!
You don't boggle at the thought, do you?
You'll accept anything,
anything but reality!
Trying to use Jenny and poor old Lowther,
making him play house.
I do not use Mr. Lowther.
It is I who allow myself to be used.
I give him every attention.
I cook for him.
You feed him instead of loving him.
Isn't that it?
You know nothing about what there is
of love between Gordon and me!
Oh, my God! All those boring hours
in bed with old Lowther...
puffing bravely away...
Good. That's more like it.
That was direct.
That's the first actual contact
between us in three years.
Get out! Get out!
Get out of my class! My girls.
Little girls, this is Mr. Lloyd,
the art master.
When you are 14,
if he is still at Marcia Blaine...
I will then hand you over to him,
and you will be fortunate enough...
to receive
his artistic guidance.
- Good-bye, girls.
- Good-bye, Mr. Lloyd.
See you in three years.
Good-bye, Miss Brodie.
I also hope I shall see you.
For the rest of the afternoon...
I have decided we will
not do more history.
Rather, I will show you some more slides...
of my last holidays in Italy.
Monitors, the blinds, please.
Clara, will you
pull down the screen?
I also spent
two weeks in Egypt...
where people do not believe
in God, but in Allah.
Kathryn, will you
switch on the light, please?
The bottom, left-hand side.
I have brought you these slides
at my own expense.
The girls at the back
may sit up on their desks.
Rome.
This is a large formation
of Il Duce's fascisti.
They are following him
in noble destiny.
I, myself,
mingled with such a crowd.
I wore my silk dress
with red poppies...
which is right for my coloring.
Benito Mussolini.
Il Duce.
Italy's leader supreme.
A Roman worthy of his heritage.
The greatest Roman of them all.
The Colosseum...
where Christian slaves
were thrown to the lions...
and gladiators
fought to the death.
"Hail, Caesar.
Those who are about to die salute thee".
Florence.
The David of Michelangelo.
That is the original David.
He's in the Galleria
dell'Accademia di Belle Arti.
There's a copy
in the Piazza della Signoria...
next to the Palazzo Vecchio.
He's there for any passer-by
to gaze upon and be uplifted.
He's at once the glory of the past
and the inspiration of the future.
David, the young warrior.
This is a picture
of the Ponte Vecchio...
"The old bridge" Ponte Vecchio.
There's a famous painting
of Dante meeting Beatrice...
It is pronounced
"Beatrichi" in Italian...
which makes it very beautiful...
Meeting Beatrice
on the Ponte Vecchio.
He fell in love with her
at that moment.
He was a man in his middle years.
She was 14. That can happen.
A mature man can find love
in a young girl, a very young girl.
Find the spring...
the essence of all old loves.
It is not unlikely that
we shall never know...
that Beatrice
reminded Dante sharply...
in that moment
when he first saw her...
on the Ponte Vecchio...
of an old love...
a lost love, a sublime love...
and he was seized
with such a longing...
such longing...
That picture
was painted by Rossetti.
Who was Dante Gabriel Rossetti?
Jenny, who was
Dante Gabriel Rossetti?
Clara.
A painter, Miss Brodie.
What... What was that you said?
A painter.
Yes. Yes, a painter.
Oh, yes.
A paint...
A painter.
Where you're mistaken is in supposing
that Jean Brodie is unique.
There's an army of these ladies
in Edinburgh.
It's simply that they do not
attempt to teach in schools...
of the traditional character
of Marcia Blaine.
She is a magnificent specimen.
She's utterly ridiculous.
There's no contradiction in being
both ridiculous and magnificent.
Your young mind will have to
stretch a bit to grasp that.
I think my young mind
is stretched astonishingly...
to be able to discuss
at 17... at 17...
the enduring passion
of my lover for another woman.
It is not only
astonishing, Sandy...
it is unnatural.
You should be passionate...
and involved...
and shortsighted.
- I'm tired.
- Take a rest, then.
I'll make some tea.
Her and her passions,
her fascisti.
You should see her skulking around
the third formers, trying to raise funds for Franco.
Franco? Oh, my God.
Oh, yes.
We've gone very Spanish this term...
what with Mary McGregor's
brother and all.
What's Mary McGregor's
miserable brother got to do with Franco?
Haven't you heard?
He's run off to Spain to fight.
Miss Brodie's
beside herself with joy.
Jean knows nothing of politics
or politicians.
She simply invests all leaders
with her own romantic vision.
Why isn't there ever
anything to eat in this place?
You know, it occurred to me
that the Brodie set...
has been Miss Brodie's faithful fascisti,
marching along...
and I suddenly thought
of her disapproval of the Girl Guides.
Why, it's simply jealousy.
The Guides are a rival fascisti...
and she cannot bear it.
How I wish
I'd joined the Brownies.
What a spiteful child it is.
You're too irritable
for a girl of your age.
My age does bother you,
doesn't it?
How much longer are you going to be
tempted by this firm, young flesh?
Until you're and over the hill.
Hey, Teddy, take me dancing.
- Certainly not.
- What a coward.
A man with a wife and six children
plus a schoolgirl for a mistress...
can be called any number of rude names,
but "coward" is not one of them.
So sweet, the flesh of the neck.
If only it could be
bottled and sold across the counter.
I really shouldn't feed
your depraved appetite.
Hey, Teddy. Teddy, listen.
When can I look at my painting?
I'm very bored with not being allowed
to see my own portrait.
When I've finished it,
and I shall never finish it.
We shall go on like this
until one or both of us is dead.
Now. I want to see myself
mirrored in your eyes.
- I need a vision of myself.
- No, Sandy. No.
I haven't finished it yet.
- I'm not pleased with it yet.
- Oh, you.
You'll never be pleased.
Sandy!
I cannot help myself, Sandy.
Believe me, it has nothing to do
with what I feel for you.
Even the skin tones are hers.
It's not even my skin.
And I thought...
I really thought that you...
Well, you know, desired me.
Desired me.
I... I do.
It might just as well
have been Jenny after all.
It would have been
the same with anyone.
Sandy, listen to me.
Love is the most irrational thing
on God's Earth.
Do you think I choose
to love Jean Brodie?
If I could choose,
I would love my wife or you.
You are the most
remarkable girl I've ever known.
You are marvelous
and astonishing and desirable.
Why would I not choose to love you,
if I could choose?
Please don't think less
of yourself because I am...
bewitched.
Very well.
I shan't.
- Believe what I'm telling you.
- Oh, I believe you, Teddy.
I even believe that
you are bewitched.
I'm not sure about God, but I am now
quite sure about witches.
Will you be back tomorrow?
No, I won't be back.
That really would be
a waste of time, wouldn't it?
Good night, Teddy.
You can go on painting.
You don't really need a model.
As this seems to be
a time for truth...
you're quite
a mediocre painter, Teddy.
You'll never be really good.
I wonder you don't try
some other line.
You are getting on, you know.
Generalissimo Franco
is called El Jefe, the chief.
J-E-F-E.
The "J" is silent. El Jefe.
He is a dedicated man.
You must all grow up
to be dedicated women...
as generalissimo Franco has
dedicated himself to a cause...
as I have dedicated
myself to you.
Dedication is
the order of the day.
Oh, Mary McGregor, girls,
come and join us.
Mary, dear, is there any news
from your brother from Spain?
No, Miss Brodie.
Nothing.
Mr. Ealing at the b-bank
is sending for him...
sending d-d-detectives to Spain.
Your brother is being sent for?
Mr. Ealing at the bank
would send for Caesar.
The Mr. Ealings at the bank
have tried throughout history...
to stay the march
of civilization.
Why can't they understand? It should
be obvious to the meanest intelligence.
Franco's army comprises the best
elements of Spain and her supporters.
They are committed
to heroic action.
You little girls are living
in a time that will demand...
all that you have to give
of courage and gallantry.
You must become heroines.
Heroines!
Do you mean we will have to
march and shoot guns?
If you are called.
Girls?
Have you never heard
of Hannah Snell?
She was an English girl born in 1and sailed in Admiral Boscawen's fleet.
And fought at Araapong.
She was wounded.
But without medical aid, she extracted
the bullet from her own shoulder...
and lived to serve again.
Hannah Snell was a girl.
- Ooh!
- Now, you, too, must be prepared...
to serve, suffer and sacrifice.
- Are you prepared?
- Yes, Miss Brodie.
Yes, Miss Brodie.
No, Miss Brodie.
But she could get shot.
Without medical aid, she would extract
the bullet from her own shoulder...
and live to serve again.
It isn't funny.
She could really get hurt.
- What's going on? Who could get hurt?
- Mary McGregor.
She's run away to Spain
to fight.
- What kind of joke is this?
- It isn't a joke.
She's really gone to Spain.
Mary McGregor couldn't negotiate
her way across Edinburgh.
- Ah, but she has a guiding spirit.
- What are you talking about?
I'm sure Miss Brodie gave Mary
very explicit directions.
The Paris train will take you
as far as Perpignan.
P-E-R-P-I-G-N-A-N.
Now, the pounds are
in this envelope marked "pounds".
And the francs are
in this envelope marked "rancs".
And the pesetas are
in this envelope marked "pesetas".
How else?
- I don't believe it.
- Nor do I.
Miss Brodie will be frantic.
Miss Brodie will be ecstatic.
Moving your troops to Barcelona?
Mary McGregor has gone
to join her brother.
He is her only kin.
Yes, I heard you've been
raising funds for Franco.
I find that extraordinary.
The times are extraordinary.
Miss Brodie!
Miss Brodie.!
Oh, Mary McGregor.
Girls, I have
called you together...
my special girls...
to tell you the truth
about Mary McGregor.
Miss Mackay has told you
the facts about Mary's death...
how the train was bombed and machine-gunned
as it crossed the frontier...
but only I
can tell you the truth.
Mary McGregor died a heroine.
It was her intention
to fight for Franco...
against the forces of darkness.
So although she was killed before
she herself could strike a blow...
her intention
was a noble and heroic one.
Had she lived...
Mary would have become a woman
of great spirit and initiative.
Hers would have been
a dedicated life.
You must all grow up
to be dedicated women...
as Mary McGregor dedicated
her youth to a cause...
as I have dedicated
myself to you.
Tonight, little girls...
let your imaginations soar.
Think of Joan of Arc...
Florence Nightingale.
Think of Mary McGregor.
Who among you has
the makings of a heroine?
Yes, Clara?
May we think of you,
Miss Brodie?
Well, why not?
Deep in most of us
is a potential for greatness...
or the potential
to inspire greatness.
The day draws late.
Your families will be expecting you.
Take home the story
of Mary McGregor.
Sandy?
I thought you and I
might have tea together.
I wanted
to talk to you about Mary.
I'm sorry,
but I have some work to do.
How busy and grown-up you've become.
Well, I won't try to stop you, but you must
remember how much I do depend on you.
I'll remember.
âª Somebody's crying
âª Do you wonder who
âª Tears that would fill up
âª An ocean or two
âª He's too unhappy
to even feel blue
âª Somebody's crying for you
âª Somebody's crying
Pay him no mind
He's just a someone
That you left behind
Although it could be
And you'll never see
That somebody crying is me
Yesterday's lover
Like yesterday's dream
Lost like a flower
That floats down the stream
- Mr. Lloyd?
- Yes, I should think so.
âª Only the sorrow
âª Somebody's crying for you
- Would you like to dance, Sandy?
- No, thank you.
I thought it was considered
a triumph of the first magnitude...
to be asked to dance
by a male staff member.
Excuse me.
- Mr. Lloyd said I could have my portrait done.
- Monica.
- Oh, thank you, Sandy.
- All right.
âª Somebody's crying
âª Do you wonder who
âª Tears that would
fill up
âª An ocean or two
âª You know how I feel
âª For sadly, but true
âª That somebody crying is you
Would you like
some punch, Miss Brodie?
Oh, Mr. Lloyd.
Thank you.
That's very thoughtful of you.
Well, Jean,
how's the Franco fund coming along?
Mm! Not well.
Popular sentiment being what it is...
one can hardly plead the cause
in the Marcia Blaine assembly hall.
Yes, I dare say. I, too, am attempting
to raise funds for a worthy cause.
You? What sort of cause?
A romantic one. I am taking up
a collection to buy a wedding present...
for Lowther and Miss Lockhart.
May I put you down for a pound?
It's to be a simple affair in Cramond Kirk
a week on Saturday.
I'm told when they announced
their intention to Miss Mackay last evening...
her delight was so profound that she ran amok
and toasted them in neat whiskey.
- Ah, Miss Brodie.
- Oh, good evening, Mr. Burrage, girls.
- Good evening, Miss Brodie.
- I've not seen you dancing yet.
Oh, the night
is young, Mr. Burrage.
Excuse me for one moment.
Teddy... Teddy, who told you
to come to me like that?
I volunteered. "I", said the sparrow,
"with my bow and arrow".
- I volunteered.
- And what kill, pray, did you expect to make?
Do you think I cannot,
with one snap of my fingers...
send poor Miss Lockhart
back to her gaseous domain?
It was I who
encouraged Mr. Lowther...
in his reluctant
pursuit of Miss Lockhart.
What I cannot understand is you.
I cannot understand you.
Malice.
Coming to me that way...
hoping to hurt
and humiliate me, why?
I don't know.
It's what I wanted, to hurt you.
Why? Why are you
so angry with me?
Because I'm afraid.
Because I don't feel safe with you around.
You should have married old Lowther,
you really should.
I'm 43 years old, Jean.
How old are you?
- I'm f... I'm in my prime.
- Your prime!
Look at yourself, Jean.
Look at me...
a second-rate painter running to seed.
- You're not in your prime, Jean.
- Teddy, don't...
You're a frustrated spinster taking it out
in idiot causes and dangerous ideas.
- A schoolmarm.
- I am a teacher.
A teacher or a leader?
The dangerous Miss Brodie
and her troops.
Well, where you lead
I cannot follow.
Arrivederci.
- Mr. Burrage, will you dance?
- Yes. Yes. Delighted.
Thank you so much.
Miss Mackay...
since you were first appointed
headmistress of Marcia Blaine...
you have done nothing but try
to dismiss me from the teaching staff.
You have tried
every feeble excuse...
even that of immorality,
and failed.
Now you are accusing me
of preaching politics to my pupils.
Such a continuous
personal vendetta...
is hardly conducive
to the dignity of your position.
Miss Brodie, I don't think
you quite understand.
Let me make the situation
perfectly clear.
It is not I,
but the board of governors...
who have pursued this investigation
to its conclusion.
And it is
the board of governors who...
after having given due consideration
to the grave charges laid against you...
have given instructions that you leave
this school immediately...
and that your classes be taken over
tomorrow morning by another teacher.
The board have asked me
to convey to you the fact that...
your salary will be paid in full
until the end of the term...
which, in the circumstances,
is more than generous.
Miss Brodie,
there is nothing more to be said.
I shall not accept
the board's action.
I shall petition. I shall put
the question before the public...
before the parents
and the student body.
You will find, Miss Mackay,
that I have the loyalty of my girls.
Do you, Miss Brodie?
âª For they are jolly good fellows
âª Which nobody can deny.
Come, now, Lowther, give us a song.!
Why, Miss Brodie,
aren't you coming to the common room?
- Common room?
- The celebration honoring Miss Lockhart and Mr. Lowther.
My love is like a red, red rose
Aren't you coming, Miss Brodie?
I'll...
I'll be there shortly.
âª In June
Oh, my love is like a melody
That's sweetly played in tune
As fair art thou my bonny lass
So deep in love am I
And I will love
thee still, my dear
Sandy.
Sandy.
I believe, Sandy...
I believe I am past my prime.
I had reckoned
on my prime lasting...
till I was
at least... 50.
Are you listening, Sandy?
I'm listening, Miss Brodie.
I have been dismissed
from Marcia Blaine.
I am accused of teaching
treason and sedition to my students.
I am being transported
for radicalism...
like Thomas Muir of Huntershill.
But if Miss Mackay
and her conspirators...
expect that I shall meekly lay my head
on their chopping block...
- they're in for a wee surprise.
- What will you do?
As I informed Miss Mackay,
I will resort to public petition.
I have no doubt that many supporters
will rally to my defense.
My students are loyal.
My girls.
Someone betrayed me, Sandy.
Someone spoke against me to the board.
Who could it
have been? Who?
Are you thinking that
maybe one of your girls betrayed you?
I said to Miss Mackay...
"I have the loyalty of my girls,
and she said,
"Do you?"
I'll not believe it. I'll not believe
it was one of my girls.
Perhaps it's true.
I thought possibly Monica.
There's very little soul...
- Monica is a loyal girl.
- I know. You all are.
Monica and Jenny.
Oh, not Jenny.
She's like a part of myself.
You, Sandy... As you see,
you are exempt from all suspicion.
You have had more
of my confidence than anyone.
You know more than anyone
what I have sacrificed for my girls.
Teddy Lloyd was greatly
in love with me, Sandy...
as I think you've always known.
And I gave him up to consecrate
my life to the young girls in my care...
you and Monica and Jenny.
Jenny...
She and Mr. Lloyd
will soon be lovers.
- I have that.
- Do you think that you are Providence?
That you can ordain love?
What?
You haven't pulled it off.
Jenny will not be
Teddy Lloyd's lover.
What are you saying, Sandy?
Jenny will not be
Teddy Lloyd's lover...
and I'll not be your spy,
your secret service.
My spy? What on earth
are you talking about?
Do you understand at all
what has happened to me?
I have been dismissed
from Marcia Blaine!
Why are you standing there talking
about Providence and the secret service?
What is the matter with you?
Miss Brodie, I am Teddy's lover.
What?
I am Teddy's lover.
Teddy's lover? You?
Is that so difficult to believe?
What does it matter to you which one of us it is?
It doesn't matter to Teddy.
Whatever possessed you?
You know his religion.
How could a girl
with a mind of her own...
have to do with a man
who can't think for himself?
That doesn't seem
to have bothered either of us, does it?
We were neither of us
very interested in his mind.
How dare you speak to me
in this manner!
I suppose I've always known that one day
you were going to ask how dare I?
Why? I don't understand.
I don't seem to understand
what has happened to everyone.
Where has everyone gone?
Only Mary is gone.
Mary? What has Mary
to do with it?
Miss Brodie,
Mary McGregor is dead!
Are you aware of
the order of importance...
in which you place
your anxieties?
One, you have been betrayed.
Two, who is or is not to be your proxy
in Teddy Lloyd's bed...
and three, Mary's death.
Miss Brodie, aren't you concerned
at all with Mary's death?
I grieve for Mary.
It was because of you she went!
Because of me?
It was her brother.
The poor, unfortunate girl
hadn't anyone else in the world.
She had you.
That was her misfortune.
To please you, that silly, stupid girl
ran off and got herself killed!
Don't you feel
responsible for that?
No.
No, I feel responsible
for giving her ideals...
The ideals that
sent her to Spain.
I feel responsible for teaching her
that service to a cause is a privilege.
You call it a privilege
to be killed?
And for nothing.
Nothing!
You really are
a shallow girl, Sandy.
By the way she died,
Mary McGregor illumined her life.
- She died a heroine.
- She died a fool!
Joining her brother to fight for Franco...
wasn't that just like Mary?
Her brother is fighting
for the other side.
- Her brother...
- Her brother is fighting for the Republicans!
Mary was headed
for the wrong army!
Oh, Mary McGregor!
"Mary McGregor".
I used to wonder why
you always called Mary by her full name.
I think it was because you had
such a hard time remembering who she was.
Poor, dim Mary.
I was devoted to Mary.
No, you were only attracted to Mary
because she had no one else...
and she was
so totally suggestible.
She appealed to your vanity!
It was you who betrayed me.
I didn't betray you!
I simply put a stop to you!
Oh, I see.
No, you don't see.
You don't see that
you're not good for people.
In what way?
In what way, Sandy,
was I not good for you?
You are dangerous
and unwholesome...
and children should not
be exposed to you!
How can you think it?
How can you think
that I would harm you?
- But you have... You have harmed me!
- How?
You have murdered Mary!
You have assassinated me!
Oh, why must you
always strike attitudes?
You really are
a ridiculous woman!
What will you do... now?
Do?
I don't know.
But I am a descendant,
do not forget...
of Willie Brodie.
He was a man of substance...
A cabinetmaker
and a designer of gibbets...
a member of the town council
of Edinburgh...
the keeper of two mistresses
who bore him five children between them.
Blood tells.
He played much dice and fighting cocks.
Eventually, he was a wanted man
for having robbed the excise office.
Not that he needed the money.
He was a burglar
for the sake of the danger.
He died cheerfully
on a gibbet of his own devising in 1788.
That is the stuff I am made of.
I knew you would rise
like a phoenix.
I'm glad I shall not
have to worry about you.
No, I expect that
is to be your gift, Sandy...
to kill without concern.
It is you who are dangerous.
You see yourself as a conqueror,
don't you, Sandy?
Kaiserian in all
his beauty rare.
But you profess to be
a great admirer of conquerors.
Good-bye, Miss Brodie.
Assassin!
Assassin!
âª Lord, dismiss us
with Thy blessing
âª Thanks for mercies
past receive
âª Pardon all
their faults confessing
âª Time that's lost
may all retrieve
âª May thy children
May thy children
âª Never again
Thy spirit grieve
Today we say good-bye
to those senior girls...
who are leaving
Marcia Blaine for the last time.
You girls are about
to take your place...
in a larger,
more demanding world.
In this world, you will be called upon
to make many moral decisions...
affecting not only
your own lives...
but the lives of your families,
your friends, your acquaintances.
We are confident,
truly confident...
that the training you have received
here in this school...
will have equipped you to face life's quandaries
with courage and character.
For here at Marcia Blaine...
we have done our best
to nurture the virtuous woman...
for her price
is far above rubies.
Let us pray.
Little girls...
I am in the business
of putting old heads on young shoulders...
and all my pupils
are the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me.
Give me a girl
at an impressionable age...
and she is mine for life.
$&$The Social network$&$
Did you know there are more
people with genius IQs living in China
than there are people of any
kind living in the United States?
-That can't possibly be true. -It is.
What would account for that?
Well, first, an awful lot of people
live in China, but here's my question.
How do you distinguish
yourself in a population of people
who all got 1600 on their SATs?
- I didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't.
I wasn't talking about China
anymore, I was talking about me.
You got a 1600?
Yes. I could sing in an a
cappella group, but I can't sing.
Does that mean you
actually got nothing wrong?
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.
Or you could get into a final club.
Or I get into a final club.
You know, from a woman's perspective,
sometimes not singing in an a
cappella group is a good thing.
This is serious.
On the other hand, I do
like guys who row crew.
Well, I can't do that.
I was kidding.
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.
-To row crew? -To get into a final club.
To row crew? No. Are you,
like, whatever, delusional?
Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once.
I'm not sure which one I'm
supposed to be aiming at.
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?
No.
Okay, well, they're bigger than
me. They're world-class athletes.
And a second ago, you said
you like guys who row crew
so I assumed you had met one.
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.
Okay.
Should we get something to eat?
Would you like to talk
about something else?
No. It's just since the beginning of
the conversation about finals club,
I think I may have missed a birthday.
There are really more people in China with
genius 1Qs than the entire population...
The Phoenix is the most diverse. The
Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc.
Which one?
The Porcellian, the Porc.
It's the best of the best.
-Which Roosevelt? -Theodore.
Is it true that they send a
bus around to pick up girls
who want to party with
the next Fed chairman?
So you can see why
it's so important to get in.
Okay, well, which is
the easiest to get into?
- Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking.
None of them. That's the point.
My friend Eduardo made $300,betting oil futures one summer
and Eduardo won't come close to getting in.
The ability to make money doesn't
impress anybody around here.
Must be nice. He made $300,000 in a summer?
- He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures.
You can read the weather, you
can predict the price of heating oil.
I think you asked me that
because you think the final
club that's easiest to get into
is the one where I'll have the best chance.
I... What?
You asked me which one
was the easiest to get into
because you think that that's the
one where I'll have the best chance.
The one that's the easiest
to get into would be the one
where anybody has the best chance.
You didn't ask me which
one was the best one,
you asked me which one was the easiest one.
I was honestly just asking,
okay? I was just asking to ask.
-Mark, I'm not speaking in code. -Erica.
You're obsessed with finals clubs.
You have finals clubs OCD and
you need to see someone about it
who will prescribe you
some sort of medication.
You don't care if the side
effects may include blindness.
Final clubs. Not "finals clubs."
And there's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated.
Yes. There is.
Well, you do. That was
cryptic, so you do speak in code.
I didn't mean to be cryptic.
I'm just saying I need to
do something substantial
in order to get the attention of the clubs.
-Why? -Because they're exclusive.
And fun, and they lead to a better life.
Teddy Roosevelt didn't
get elected president
because he was a
member of the Phoenix Club.
He was a member of the
Porcellian, and yes, he did.
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be?
Did you really just say that?
I was kidding.
Just because something's
trite doesn't make it less true.
I wanna try to be straightforward with you
and tell you I think you might
want to be a little more supportive.
If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings,
and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet.
You would do that for me?
We're dating.
Okay.
Well, I wanna try and be
straightforward with you
and let you know that we're not anymore.
- What do you mean?
- We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry.
-Is this a joke? -No, it's not.
You're breaking up with me?
You're gonna introduce me to people
I wouldn't normally
have the chance to meet?
What the... What is that supposed to mean?
- Wait, settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean?
Erica, the reason we're able
to sit here and drink right now
is 'cause you used to
sleep with the door guy.
"The door guy"? His name is Bobby.
I have not slept with the door guy.
The door guy is a friend of mine, and
he's a perfectly good class of people.
And what part of Long Island
are you from, Wimbledon?
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm.
-Is this real? -Yes.
- Then wait, I apologize, okay?
- I have to go study.
-Erica? -Yes?
I'm sorry, I mean it.
I appreciate that,
but I have to go study.
Come on, you don't have
to study. Let's just talk.
-I can't. -Why?
Because it is exhausting. Dating
you is like dating a StairMaster.
All I meant is that you're
not likely to... Currently...
I wasn't making a comment
on your appearance.
I was saying that you go to
BU. I was stating a fact, that's all,
and if it seemed rude, then I apologize.
- I have to go study.
- You don't have to study.
Why do you keep saying
I don't have to study?
"Cause you go to BU.
Do you want to get some food?
I am sorry you are not sufficiently
impressed with my education.
And I'm sorry I don't have
a rowboat, SO we're even.
- I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends.
I was just being polite.
I have no intention of
being friends with you.
I'm under some pressure
right now from my OS class
and if we could just order
some food, I think we should...
Okay, you are probably going to be
a very successful computer person.
But you're gonna go through
life thinking that girls don't like you
because you're a nerd.
And I want you to know from the
bottom of my heart that that won't be true.
It'll be because you're an asshole.
Erica Albright's a bitch.
Do you think that's because her
family changed their name from Albrecht,
or do you think it's because
all BU girls are bitches?
For the record, she may look like a 34C,
but she's getting all kinds of help
from our friends at Victoria's Secret.
She's a 34B, as in barely
anything there. False advertising.
The truth is, she has a nice face.
I need to do something
to take my mind off her.
Easy enough, except I need an idea.
I'm a little intoxicated,
I'm not gonna lie.
So what if it's not even 10:p.m. and it's a Tuesday night?
Billy.
The Kirkland Facebook
is open on my desktop,
and some of these people have
pretty horrendous Facebook pics.
Billy Olson's sitting here and had
the idea of putting some of the pictures
next to pictures of farm animals
and have people vote on who's hotter.
Good call, Mr. Olson.
Yeah, it's on. I'm not
gonna do the farm animals,
but I like the idea of
comparing two people together.
It gives the whole
thing a very "Turing" feel
since people's ratings of the
pictures will be more implicit
than, say, choosing a number to
represent each person's hotness,
like they do on hot or not.com.
The first thing we're going
to need is a lot of pictures.
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't
keep a public centralized Facebook,
so I'm going to have to get all the images
from the individual
houses that people are in.
Let the hacking begin.
First up is Kirkland.
They keep everything open and allow
indexes in their Apache configuration.
So a little Wget magic
is all that's necessary
to download the entire
Kirkland Facebook.
Kids' stuff.
Next is Eliot.
They're also open, but
with no indexes on Apache.
I can run an empty search
and it returns all of the images
in the database in a single page.
And I can save the page and
Mozilla will save all the images for me.
Excellent. Moving right along.
Excuse me! Everybody!
You are at one of the oldest,
one of the most exclusive clubs,
not just at Harvard, but in the world.
And I want to welcome you all
to Phoenix Club's first
party of the fall semester!
Lowell has some security. They
require a user name/password combo,
and I'm gonna go ahead and say they don't
have access to the main FAS user database,
so they have no way
of detecting an intrusion.
Adams has no security, but limits
the number of results to 20 a page.
All I need to do is break out the same
script I used on Lowell and we're set.
Quincy has no online Facebook. What a sham.
Nothing I can do about that.
Dunster is intense.
Not only is there no public
directory, but there's no directory at all.
You have to do searches,
and if your search returns more
than 20 matches, nothing gets returned.
And once you do get results,
they don't link directly to the images.
They link to a PHP that
redirects or something. Weird.
This may be difficult.
I'll come back later.
-Hey, Shark Week's on. -What?
-Great white, beautiful fish. -Nice.
Leverett is a little better.
They still make you search,
but you can do an
empty search and get
links to pages with
every student's picture.
It's slightly obnoxious that they
only let you view one picture at a time,
and there's no way I'm going to go to
500 pages to download pics one at a time.
So it's definitely necessary to break
out Emacs and modify that Perl script.
Here you go.
Done.
Hey, what's going on?
Perfect timing. Eduardo's here and
he's going to have the key ingredient.
-Hey, Mark. -Wardo.
You and Erica split up.
How did you know that?
It's on your blog.
-Yeah. -Are you all right?
-I need you. -I'm here for you.
No, I need the algorithm
you use to rank chess players.
-Are you okay? -We're ranking girls.
-You mean other students. -Yeah.
You think this is such a good idea?
- I need the algorithm.
- Mark... I need the algorithm.
Give each girl a base rating of 1400.
At any given time Girl A has a
rating R-a and Girl B has a rating R-b.
When any two girls are matched up,
there's an expectation of which will win
based on their current rating, right?
Yeah. And those expectations
are expressed this way.
Let's write it.
One on the left.
The right.
Yeah, still the right.
-It works. -Who should we send it to first?
-Dwyer. -Neal.
- Who are you gonna send it to?
- Just a couple of people.
The question is,
who are they gonna send it to?
Hey, guys, check this out.
Someone go to the left. Dude, do left.
Look at these girls. Right or left?
- Left is hot.
- Left? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right or left?
That's my roommate.
-Oh, my God. -The girl on the left.
This is pathetic.
Right.
Left.
-Left. -Left?
Oh, shit.
Albright.
He blogged about you.
You don't wanna read it.
Left.
Latina.
Erica.
Is this yours?
I stole it from a tranny.
Get the hell out of here!
-Left. -One on the right.
Left.
Man, that's an awful lot of traffic.
You think maybe we shouldn't shut
it down before we get into trouble?
Hello?
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?
At 400 in the morning?
Well, there's a very unusual amount
of traffic to the switch at Kirkland.
You're saying it's unusual
for 4.00 in the morning?
No, this'd be unusual for
halftime at the Super Bowl.
All right.
I gotta go in.
What's going on?
Harvard's network is about to crash.
You don't think...
I do.
Go see if it's everybody's.
I can't connect.
The network's down.
Unless it's a coincidence,
I think this is us.
It's not a coincidence.
Holy shit.
So you were called in
front of the Ad Board.
That's not what happened.
You weren't called in front
of the Administrative Board?
No, back. I mean back at the bar
with Erica Albright. She said all that?
-Mark... -That I said that stuff to her?
I was reading from the
transcript of her deposition.
Yeah, why would you
even need to depose her?
That's really for us to decide.
You think if I kKnow she can make me look
like a jerk, I'll be more likely to settle.
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute?
Can we do that? It's
been almost three hours.
And frankly, you did spend an awful
lot of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg
with the girl's testimony from the bar.
I'm not embarrassed, she
just made a lot of that up.
She was under oath.
Then I guess that would be the
first time somebody's lied under oath.
The site got 2,200 hits within two hours?
Thousand.
What?
Twenty-two thousand.
Wow.
These guys are just freakin' fast.
Is there any way to make this a fair fight?
Jump out and swim.
I think we'd have to jump out and drown.
Well, you could row forward
and I could row backward.
We're genetically identical.
Science says we'd stay in one place.
Just row the damn boat.
-You guys hear about this? -What?
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked
the network from a laptop at Kirkland.
-Really? -AL 400 a.m.
How?
He set up a website where you vote
on the hotness of female undergrads.
What were we doing that
none of us heard about this?
I don't know.
A three-hour low-rate
technical row before breakfast.
Full course load. Studying.
Another three hours in
the tank and then studying.
I'm not sure how we missed it.
How much activity was there on this thing?
Twenty-two thousand page requests.
Twenty-two thousand?
Cam, this guy hacked the
Facebook of seven houses.
He set up the whole website in one
night, and he did it while he was drunk.
Twenty-two thousand?
- Well, how do you know he was drunk?
- He was blogging simultaneously.
-You know what I think? -Way ahead of you.
This is our guy.
Cameron Winklevoss.
W-I-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S.
"Cameron" spelled the usual way.
Tyler Winklevoss.
Tyler spelled the usual way, and my
last name is the same as my brother's.
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is an
Administrative Board hearing.
You're being accused of
intentionally breaching security,
violating copyrights,
violating individual privacy by creating
the website www.facemash.com.
You're also charged with being
in violation of university policy,
on distribution of digitized images.
Before we begin with our questioning,
you're allowed to make a statement.
Would you like to do so?
I...
You know, I've already apologized
in The Crimson to the ABHW,
to Fuerza Latina,
and to any women at Harvard
who may have been insulted,
as I take it that they were.
As for any charges stemming
from the breach of security,
I believe I deserve some
recognition from this board.
-I'm sorry? -Yes.
I don't understand.
Which part?
You deserve recognition?
I believe I've pointed out some
pretty gaping holes in your system.
-Excuse me, may I? -Yes.
Mr. Zuckerberg,
I'm in charge of security for all
computers on the Harvard network,
and I can assure you of its sophistication.
In fact, it was that
level of sophistication
that led us to you in
less than four hours.
-Four hours? -Yes, Sir.
That would be impressive,
except if you had known
what you were looking for,
you would have seen it written
on my dorm room window.
So?
Six months academic probation.
Wow. Well, they had to
make an example out of you.
They had my blog.
I shouldn't have written that
thing about the farm animals.
That was stupid.
But I was kidding, for God's sakes.
Doesn't anybody have a sense of humor?
- I tried to stop you. - I know.
How do you do this thing where
you manage to get all girls to hate us?
-And why do I let you? - I know.
-You can't do that. -Wardo, I said I know.
Okay, let's look at a sample problem.
Suppose we're given a computer
with a 16-bit virtual address
and a page size of 256 bytes.
The system uses one-level page
tables that start at address hex 400.
Maybe you want DMA on
your 16-bit system. Who knows?
The first few pages are
reserved for hardware flags, etc.
Assume page-table
entries have eight status bits.
The eight status bits
would then be... Anybody?
And I see we have our first surrender.
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg.
Brighter men than you have
tried and failed this class.
One valid bit, one modified bit, one
reference bit and five permission bits.
That is correct.
Does everybody see how he got there?
Mark?
-You Mark Zuckerberg? -Yeah.
-Cameron Winklevoss. -Hi.
Tyler Winklevoss.
Are you guys related?
-That's good. -Funny.
We never heard that before.
So, what can I do for you?
Did I insult your girlfriends?
No. You didn't. Actually, I don't know.
-Yeah, we never asked. -We should do that.
No.
We have an idea we
want to talk to you about.
You got a minute?
You guys look like you
spend some time at the gym.
-We have to. -Why?
We row crew.
-Yeah, I've got a minute. -Great.
- So, you ever been inside the Porcellian?
- No.
You understand we can't
take you past the bike room,
because you're not a member.
I've heard.
-You want a sandwich or something? -Okay.
-Mark, right? -Yeah.
Mark, this is Div ya
Narendra, our partner.
Hi.
We were really impressed with Facemash.
When we checked you out,
you also built CourseMatch.
I don't know CourseMatch.
You go online and see what
courses your friends are taking.
It's really smart, man.
-Mark. -Yeah.
We were talking about CourseMatch.
It was kind of a no-brainer.
But you invented something
in high school, too, right?
An app for an MP3 player that
recognizes your taste in music.
Anybody try to buy it?
Microsoft.
Wow. How much?
Didn't sell it. Uploaded it for free.
-For free? -Yeah.
Why?
Okay, well, we have something
that we've been working on for a while
and we think it's great.
It's called the Harvard Connection.
You create your own page.
Interests, bio, friends, pics.
And then people can go online,
see your bio, request to be your...
Yeah, how is that different
from MySpace or Friendster?
Harvard.ed...
Harvard. edu is the most prestigious
e-mail address in the country, man.
I mean, the whole site's kind
of based on the idea that girls...
Not to put anything indelicately, but...
Girls wanna go with guys who go to Harvard.
Div ya and my brother don't have
trouble putting things indelicately.
The main difference between what we're
talking about and MySpace or Friendster,
or any of those other
social networking sites is...
Is exclusivity. Right?
-Right. -Yeah.
We'd love for you to work with us, Mark.
I mean, we need a gifted
programmer who's creative.
And we know that you've
been taking it in the shins.
Women's groups are
ready to declare a fatwa.
But, you know, this could
help rehabilitate your image.
Wow. You would do that for me?
We'd like to work with you.
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work for Google.
Our second programmer just
got overwhelmed with schoolwork.
We would need you
to build the site and
write the code, and
we'll provide all the...
I'm In.
What?
I'm In.
Awesome.
That's what you said?
It was three or four years
ago. I don't know what I said.
When did you come to Eduardo?
I don't understand that question.
Do you remember
answering in the affirmative?
The affirmative?
When did you come to Eduardo
with the idea for Facebook?
It was called The Facebook then.
This doesn't need to be that difficult.
I'm currently in the middle
of two different lawsuits.
Did you answer affirmatively
when Tyler and Cameron
Winklevoss and Div ya Narendra
asked you to build Harvard Connection?
Did you say yes?
I said I'd help.
When did you approach Mr. Saverin
with the idea for The Facebook?
I wouldn't say I approached him.
-Sy. -You can answer the question.
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.
What's that?
The Jewish fraternity.
It was Caribbean Night.
It's not that guys like me are
generally attracted to Asian girls.
It's that Asian girls are generally
attracted to guys like me.
I'm developing an algorithm
to define the connection
between Jewish guys and Asian girls.
I don't think it's that complicated.
They're hot, they're smart,
they're not Jewish, and they can't dance.
Hey, Mark's here.
Mark!
Be right back.
I think I've come up with something.
Hang on. I gotta tell you something
that you're not gonna believe.
What?
I got punched by the Phoenix.
-Are you kidding? -No.
I mean, it's just the first
of a four-step process,
but they slid the invitation
under my door tonight.
I go to my first punch party tomorrow.
So...
You got punched by the Phoenix.
Yeah, but, you know, it was
probably just a diversity thing.
It was just a diversity thing.
Just ride that horse until...
What did you wanna talk to me about?
-Mark? -Yeah.
You said you'd come up with something.
Yeah, I think I've come up with
something. Come outside and let's talk.
It's 20 degrees outside.
I can't stare at that
loop of Niagara Falls,
which has absolutely nothing
to do with the Caribbean.
People came to Facemash
in a stampede, right?
Yeah.
But it wasn't because they
saw pictures of hot girls.
You can go anywhere on the
Internet and see pictures of hot girls.
Yeah.
It was because they saw
pictures of girls that they knew.
People want to go on the
Internet and check out their friends,
so why not build a
website that offers that?
Friends, pictures, profiles,
whatever you can visit.
Browse around. Maybe it's
someone you just met at a party.
But I'm not talking about a dating site.
I'm talking about
taking the entire social
experience of college
and putting it online.
-I can't feel my legs. - I know.
I'm totally psyched about
this, too. But, Wardo?
Yeah?
"It would be exclusive."
You would have to know the people
on the site to get past your own page.
Like getting punched.
Now, that's good.
Wardo, it's like a final club,
except we're the president.
I told him I thought it sounded great.
It was a great idea.
There was nothing to hack.
People were gonna provide their
own pictures, their own information.
And people had the ability to invite,
or not invite, their friends to join.
See, in a world where social
structure was everything,
that was the thing.
It was a big project,
and he was going to have to write
tens of thousands of lines of code,
so I wondered why he was coming
to me and not his roommates,
Dustin Moskovitz and Chris
Hughes. They were programmers.
We're gonna need a little start-up
cash to rent the servers and get it online.
So that was why.
-Did he offer terms? -Yes.
We'll split it, 70/30.
70 for me, 30 for you
for putting up the $1,
and for handling everything on
the business end. You're CFO.
And you said?
I said, "Let's do it."
Okay. Did he add anything else?
Yes.
It probably was a diversity thing.
But so what?
Why do you think he said that?
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting,
but whose discovery is this?
Sy, if you'll let me continue
with my line of questioning.
What are you suggesting?
That I was jealous of Eduardo
for getting punched by the Phoenix
and began a plan to
screw him out of a company
-I hadn't even invented yet. -Were you?
-Gretchen. -Jealous of Eduardo?
Stop typing. We're off the record.
Ma'am, I know you've done your homework,
and so you know that money
isn't a big part of my life.
But at the moment, I could
buy Mount Auburn Street,
take the Phoenix Club and
turn it into my ping-pong room.
I'll let you know how the party is.
We recognize that you're a plaintiff
in one suit involving Facebook,
and a witness in another.
Yes, sir.
At any time in the weeks prior
to Mark's telling you his idea,
did he mention Tyler
Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss,
Div ya Narendra or Harvard Connection?
Yes. He said they'd asked
him to work on their site,
but that he looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.
He said even his most pathetic friends
knew more about getting people
interested in a website than these guys.
"These guys," meaning my clients.
Yes. He resented... Mark
resented that your clients thought
that he needed to rehabilitate
his image after Facemash.
But Mark didn't want
to rehabilitate anything.
With Facemash, he'd hacked
into the Harvard computers,
he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad
Board, he'd gotten a lot of notoriety.
Facemash did exactly
what he wanted it to do.
Were you aware that while
Mr. Zuckerberg was building The Facebook,
he was also communicating
with the plaintiffs?
Not at the time, I wasn't. But...
It really didn't have much to do
with the Winklevosses' dating site.
How would you know? You weren't even there.
Ty.
Were you aware that while
Mr. Zuckerberg was building The Facebook,
he was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building Harvard Connection?
You're offering a conclusion
not found in evidence.
We are about to find it in evidence.
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss.
November 30th, 2003.
"I read over all the stuff you
sent me re: Harvard Connection.
"And it seems like it shouldn't
take too long to implement.
"So we can talk about it after I get all
the basic functionality up tomorrow night."
From Mark Zuckerberg to Cameron
Winklevoss. December 1st, 2003.
"Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I
just got about three of your missed calls.
"I was working on a problem
set for my systems class.â
From Mark Zuckerberg to
Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.
December 10, 2003.
"This week has been pretty busy
thus far with classes and work,
"so I think it's probably best
to postpone the meeting.â
âI'm also really busy tomorrow."
Okay, anybody else feel like
there's something up with this guy?
Tell him okay,
but we do have to make sure that we
meet up before we all go off for break.
I know, I know. Yeah, watch out.
Hey, Mark.
I need a dedicated Linux box running
Apache with a MySQL back end.
It's gonna cost a little more money.
-How much more? -About 200 more.
-Do we need it? -Gotta handle the traffic.
-Do it. - Ialready did.
Hey, guess what?
I made the second cut.
That's good.
You should be proud
of that right there.
Don't worry if you
don't make it any further.
I'll get out of here.
From Mark Zuckerberg to
Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
and Div ya Narendra.
December 15th, 2003.
"I have a CS problem set
that I'm just getting started with
"and it should be about 15 hours of
coding, so I'll be busy tomorrow night."
"I won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon."
"I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.
"I've basically been in the lab
this whole time, and also I..."
"Won't be able to do Saturday, as
I have to meet up with my parents."
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard,
founder of Harvard University in 1638.
It's also called the Statue of Three Lies.
What are the three lies?
Mr. Dowd.
The three lies. First... Shit!
-Take your pants off. - I know.
Mr. Saverin.
One, Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638.
Two, Harvard was not
founded by John Harvard.
And three, that is not John Harvard.
Who is it?
It's a friend of the
sculptor, Daniel Chester.
Keep your jacket on.
Thirty-nine days after Mr. Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients,
and he still hadn't completed
work on Harvard Connection.
But on January 11th, 2004,
Mr. Zuckerberg registered
the domain name The Facebook
via Network Solutions.
To the best of your knowledge, had he
even begun work on Harvard Connection?
Not to my knowledge. No.
What in the world is this?
"Hey, Cameron, I'm
still a little skeptical
that we have enough
functionality in the site
"to really draw the attention and
gain the critical mass necessary
"to get a site like this to run"?
"We'll speak soon"?
This is the first time he
mentioned any problem?
Yes, it was.
You sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg
and received 16 e-mails in return,
and this was the first time
he indicated he was not happy.
That's correct.
He had 42 days to study
our system and get out ahead.
- Do you see any of your code on Facebook?
- Sy, could you...
Did I use any of your code?
You stole our whole goddamn idea.
-Fellas. -What? Match.com for Harvard guys?
Can I continue with my deposition?
You know, you really don't need a forensics
team to get to the bottom of this.
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,
you'd have invented Facebook.
I can't wait to stand over your
shoulder and watch you write us a check.
No shit.
Let's continue.
February 4, 2004.
Mark.
Mark.
There is a girl in your art history
class. Her name is Stephanie Attis.
Do you happen to know
if she has a boyfriend?
Have you ever seen her with anyone?
And, if not, do you happen to know if
she's looking to go out with anyone?
Dustin.
People don't walk around
with a sign on them that says...
Mark?
We were supposed to meet at 9:00.
- Have you slept yet?
- I have to add something.
What?
Shit, that looks good.
That looks really good.
It's clean and simple.
No Disneyland, no "live
nude girls." But watch.
What'd you write?
"Relationship Status." "Interested In."
This is what drives life at college.
"Are you having sex or aren't you?"
It's why people take certain classes
and sit where they sit and do what they do.
And at its center, you know, that's
what The Facebook is gonna be about.
People are gonna log on because
after all the cake and watermelon,
there's a chance they're actually gonna...
-Gonna get laid. -...meet a girl. Yes.
That is really good.
And that was it.
-What do you mean? -It's ready.
-It's ready? Right now? -Yeah. That was it.
And here's the masthead.
-You made a masthead. -Yeah.
- "Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO."
- Yeah.
You have no idea what
that's gonna mean to my father.
Sure I do.
So when's it going live?
Right now. Get your laptop out.
What? Why do we need my laptop?
Because you got e-mails
for everybody at the Phoenix.
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be
cool with them that I spam their e-mails.
- This is not spam.
- No, I know it's not spam.
If we send it to our friends, it's
just gonna bounce around Dworkin.
I haven't gotten in yet.
These guys know people.
And I need their e-mails.
-Sure. -Good.
Give me the mailing list.
Jabberwock12.listserv@harvard.ed...
These guys.
Yeah, they're literary geniuses
because the world's most obvious
Lewis Carroll reference is in...
-They're not so bad. -I'm just saying.
Yeah, you're right.
The site's live.
You know, let's go get
a drink and celebrate.
I'm buying.
Mark.
Mark, are you praying?
Whatever happened to
Cole Porter and Irving Berlin?
It's a Valentine's Day theme.
They're playing love songs.
Good point.
"Cause Cole Porter and Irving
Berlin never wrote any love songs.
Honey, you should put your laptop away.
Seven different people
spammed me the same link.
-KC. -What is it?
I don't know.
But I'm really hoping it's
Cats That Look Like Hitler,
'cause I can never get enough of that.
No, it's not.
Div!
What?
This isn't mine.
Okay, what is wrong?
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.
Hey!
Hey!
Not now!
We need 20 minutes!
Okay.
I just wanted to let you know
that Zuckerberg stole our website.
Mark Zuckerberg?
He stole our website.
It's been live for more than 36 hours.
Mr. Hotchkiss? Ty, lawyer's
on the phone with Dad.
Yes, sir, I'm here with my brother
Tyler and our business partner Div ya.
"Welcome to The Facebook.
"The Facebook is an online
directory that connects people
"through different social networks.
"You must have a Harvard.
Edu address to register."
Yeah, I called earlier. I'm
looking for Mark Zuckerberg.
Yes, sir. He's actually
quoted a couple times.
I can read it to you.
"'Everyone's been
talking a lot about a
universal Facebook
within Harvard, ' he says."
"He" meaning Mark.
"I think it's kind of silly that
it would take the university
"'a couple of years to get around to it.
"I can do a classier job than
they can and I did it in a week."
Tell him Div ya Narendra called.
- I know, that's how he talks.
- Appreciate it.
"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said,
"over 650 students had
registered to use the face book.com.
"He said he anticipated
that 900 students
would have joined the
site by this morning."
Yeah, Div ya was just reading that students signed up for it on the first day.
God, if I was a drug dealer I couldn't
give free drugs to 650 people in one day.
And this guy doesn't have three
friends to rub together to make a fourth.
All right. Yes, that's what
we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss.
We'll put all this together
and we'll e-mail it to you.
Well, you won't be able to
go on the website yourself.
Because you don't have a Harvard...
You know what, it would just
be easier for us to e-mail it to you.
I'm sure you're right.
He's a good guy and he's very bright
and I'm sure he didn't mean to do...
Wow.
What he did.
All right, thank you very much. And, Dad...
All right, love you, too.
- This is a good guy?
- We don't know that he's not a good guy.
We know he stole our idea.
We know he lied to our
faces for a month and a half.
- No, he never lied to our faces.
- Okay, he never saw our faces.
Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts
and he gave himself a 42-day head start,
because he knows what apparently you don't,
which is that getting
there first is everything.
I'm a competitive racer, Div.
I don't think you need
to school me in the
importance of getting
there first. Thank you.
- That was your father's lawyer?
- It was his in-house counsel.
He's gonna look at all this
and if he thinks it's appropriate
he'll send a cease-and-desist letter.
What's that gonna do?
What, do you wanna hire
an IP lawyer and sue him?
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to
beat the shit out of him with a hammer.
- We don't even have to do that.
- That's right.
We could do that ourselves. I'm
6'6", 220, and there's two of me.
-I'm with this guy. -Well, whatever.
I'm saying, let's calm down until
we know what we're talking about.
How much more information
are you waiting for?
We met with Mark three
times, we exchanged 52 e-mails,
we can prove that he looked at the code.
- What is that on the bottom of the page?
- It says "A Mark Zuckerberg production."
-On the home page? -On every page.
Shit, I need a second to let
the classiness waft over me.
Okay, look, we don't know...
Cam, they wrote, "Zuckerberg
said he hoped the privacy options
"would help restore his reputation
"âfollowing student outrage
over facemash.com."
That's exactly what we said to him.
He's giving us the finger in The Crimson.
While we're waiting for Dad's
lawyer to look this stuff over,
we can at least get something
going in the paper so people know...
-What? -...that this is in dispute.
We're not starting a
knife fight in The Crimson.
And we're not suing anybody.
Why not?
I don't understand, I
don't understand. Why not?
He's gonna say it's stupid.
What, who, me?
Say it. Why not?
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.
This is Harvard, where you don't
plant stories and you don't sue people.
You thought he was gonna be the
only one who thought that was stupid?
During the time when
you say you had this idea,
did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?
"A family of means"?
Did you know their father was wealthy?
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.
It's not important you
be sure why I'm asking.
-It's not important to you. -Sy.
Did you know that they came from money?
I had no idea whether they
came from money or not.
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra,
you referenced Howard
Winklevoss' consulting firm.
If you say so.
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose
assets are in the hundreds of millions.
You also knew Tyler and
Cameron were members
of a Harvard final club
called the Porcellian.
They pointed that out.
- Excuse us for inviting you in.
- To the bike room.
Please. So it's safe to say you were
aware that my clients had money.
Yes.
Let me tell you why I'm asking.
I'm wondering why, if you needed
$1,000 for an Internet venture,
you didn't ask my clients for it.
They had demonstrated an
interest to you in that kind of thing.
I went to my friend for the money because
that's who I wanted to be partners with.
Eduardo was the president of
the Harvard Investors Association,
and he was also my best friend.
Your best friend is
suing you for $600 million.
I didn't know that. Tell me more.
Eduardo, what happened
after the initial launch?
I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind
addressing him as Mr. Saverin?
- Gretchen, they're best friends.
- Not anymore.
Well, we already went through
this on the... Never mind.
Mr. Saverin, what happened
after the initial launch?
It exploded.
Everybody on campus was using it.
"Facebook me" was a common
expression after two weeks.
And Mark?
And Mark was the biggest thing on a
campus that included 19 Nobel laureates,
15 Pulitzer Prize winners, two
future Olympians, and a movie star.
Who was the movie star?
Does it matter?
No.
At Out of Town News and picked up
that copy of Popular Electronics magazine
with the MITS Altair kit on the cover.
It was a beautiful day and I
was in my Radcliffe dorm room.
He brought that magazine up
and he showed it to me and he said,
"Look, it's gonna happen
without us. We've gotta start now."
And I said, "Okay. Let's
get BASIC out there."
Now, most of you think you know
the rest of the story, but you may not.
The beginnings of this
industry were very humble.
That kit computer on the cover of that
magazine had an 8080 processor in it.
Unless you paid extra for a 1K
memory board, you got 256 bytes.
So the challenge when I wrote
BASIC wasn't just to run at 4 k-bytes,
but I also had to leave room for the
users to run their programs in 4 k-bytes.
Your friend. Is that Mark Zuckerberg?
Yeah.
-He made The Facebook. -Yeah.
I mean, it's both of ours.
We're... Yeah, we... Yes.
Cool.
I'm Christy Ling. This is Alice.
Hi.
Well, very nice to meet you.
Facebook me when you get home.
You know, maybe we can
all go out and grab a drink.
Certainly.
Absolutely do that.
She said, "Facebook me and
we can all go for a drink later,"
which is stunningly great for two reasons.
One, she said "Facebook me," right?
And then the other is, well, you know...
They wanna have drinks later.
Yes, have you ever heard
so many different good things
packed into one regular-sized sentence?
Excuse me, Mark?
Yeah?
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your OS lab.
Sure.
- Awesome job with The Facebook.
- Awesome job.
Thanks.
-I'm Bob. -How you doing?
You know, I could swear
he was looking at you
when he said the next Bill
Gates could be right in this room.
I doubt it.
And I showed up late. I don't
even know who the speaker was.
It was Bill Gates.
Shit, that makes sense.
All right. Thanks, guys.
- Are you a moron?
- Are you medically stupid?
You can't tell Bill Gates is
in front of you for an hour?
I wasn't wearing my contacts.
Can I get a Glock and kill you?
It's time to monetize the thing.
What were their names?
-Hear what I just said? -When?
I said it's time to monetize the site.
What does that mean?
It means it's time for the website
to start generating revenue.
No, I know what the word means.
I'm asking how you wanna do it.
-Advertising. -No.
Well, we got 4,000 members.
'Cause The Facebook is cool,
and if we start installing pop-ups for
Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool.
Well, I wasn't thinking
Mountain Dew, but at some point,
and I'm talking as the business
end of the company, the site...
We don't even know what it
is yet. We don't know what it is.
We don't know what it can be.
We don't know what it will be.
We know that it is cool.
That is a priceless
asset I'm not giving up.
- So when will it be finished?
- It won't be finished.
That's the point. The way
fashion's never finished.
-What? -Fashion. Fashion is never finished.
You're talking about fashion? Really, you?
I'm talking about the idea of it and
I'm saying that it's never finished.
Okay. But they manage to
make money selling pants.
Mark, what is this?
-What? -This.
It's called a cease-and-desist
letter. What were their names?
-Who? -The girls.
When did you get this?
About 10 days ago. Right
after we launched the site.
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, the girls. What were their names?
The Winklevoss twins are
saying that you stole their idea.
I find that to be a little
more than mildly annoying.
Oh, well, they find it to be
intellectual property theft.
-Look... -Why didn't you show this to me?
It was addressed to me.
They're saying that we stole The Facebook
from Div ya Narendra and the Winklevosses.
-I know what it says. -Did we?
Did we what?
Don't screw around with me now. Look at me.
The letter says we could face legal action.
No, it says I could face legal action.
This is from a lawyer, Mark. They
must feel they have some grounds.
The lawyer is their
father's house counsel.
Do they have grounds?
The grounds are our
thing is cool and popular,
and Harvard Connection is lame.
Wardo, I didn't use any
of their code, I promise.
I didn't use anything.
Look, a guy who builds a
nice chair doesn't owe money
to everyone who ever
has built a chair, okay?
They came to me with
an idea, I had a better one.
- Why didn't you show me this letter?
- I didn't think it was a big deal.
Okay.
So if there's something wrong, if there's
ever anything wrong, you can tell me.
I'm the guy that wants
to help. This is our thing.
Now, is there anything
that you need to tell me?
No.
What are we doing about this?
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services
and he told me to write them back.
And what did you say?
"When we met in January, I
expressed my doubts about the site.
"Where it stood with graphics,
how much programing was left
âthat I had not anticipated."
"The lack of hardware we
had to deal with site use,
"the lack of promotion that would go
on to successfully launch the website."
This was the first time you
raised any of those concerns, right?
I'd raised concerns before.
-Bullshit. -Not to us.
Gentlemen, I'm talking
about at the meeting
in January to which
this letter is referring.
Yeah.
Let me rephrase this.
You sent my client 16 e-mails. In the
first 15 you didn't raise any concerns.
Is that a question?
In the 16th e-mail you raised
concerns about the site's functionality.
- Were you leading them on for six weeks?
- No.
Then why didn't you raise
any of these concerns before?
-It's raining. -I'm sorry?
It just started raining.
Mr. Zuckerberg, do I
have your full attention?
No.
Do you think I deserve it?
What?
Do you think I deserve your full attention?
I had to swear an oath
before we began this deposition
and I don't wanna perjure myself,
so I have a legal obligation to say no.
Okay. No. You don't think
I deserve your attention?
I think if your clients wanna sit on
my shoulders and call themselves tall,
they have a right to give it a try,
but there's no requirement that I
enjoy sitting here listening to people lie.
You have part of my attention.
You have the minimum amount.
The rest of my attention is
back at the offices of Facebook,
where my colleagues and I are
doing things that no one in this room,
including and especially your clients,
are intellectually or
creatively capable of doing.
Did I adequately answer
your condescending question?
Well, I have 12:45. Why
don't we say that's lunch?
Back at 2:30.
So what were their names?
Their names were Christy and Alice,
and they wanna have drinks tonight.
You're not supposed to be
in here. This is a men's room.
Wow.
Oh, my God.
I don't care.
Hey, man, sorry.
A couple girls are freshening up in there.
Sweet.
We have groupies.
I'll be right back.
Mark, where you going? Mark.
Erica?
Hi.
I saw you from over there. I didn't
know you came to this club a lot.
-First time. -Mine, too.
Could I talk to you alone for a second?
I think I'm good right here.
I just... I'd love to talk to you
alone if we could just go someplace.
Right here is fine.
I don't know if you heard about
this new website I launched.
No.
The Facebook?
You called me a bitch
on the Internet, Mark.
That's why I wanted to talk to you.
-On the Internet. -That's why I came over.
Comparing women to farm animals.
I didn't end up doing that.
It didn't stop you from writing it.
As if every thought that tumbles
through your head was so clever
it would be a crime
for it not to be shared.
The Internet's not written in
pencil, Mark, it's written in ink,
and you published that
Erica Albright was a bitch,
right before you made some ignorant
crack about my family's name, my bra size,
and then rated women
based on their hotness.
- Erica, is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.
You write your snide
bullshit from a dark room
because that's what the angry do nowadays.
I was nice to you. Don't torture me for it.
If we could just go
somewhere for a minute...
I don't wanna be rude to my friends.
Okay.
Okay.
Good luck with your video game.
Hey, that was great. That
was the right thing to do.
You apologized, right?
We have to expand.
Sure. Mark?
Is he mad about something?
Okay, we are expanding
to Yale and Columbia.
Dustin, I want you to share
the coding work with me.
Chris, you're gonna be in
charge of publicity and outreach,
and you could start by getting a
story in the BU student newspaper.
It's The Bridge.
They hate doing stories about Harvard.
Somebody at the newspaper
will be a computer science major.
Tell them that Mark Zuckerberg
will do 10 hours of free programing.
Why do you want a story
in the BU newspaper?
Because I do. Now here's the arrangement.
Eduardo is CFO and owns 30% of the company.
Dustin is vice president
and head of programing,
and his 5% of the company
will come from my end.
Chris is director of publicity,
and his compensation will depend
on how much work he ends up doing.
Any questions?
- Who are the girls?
- Sorry. They're Christy and Alice.
-Hi. -Hi.
-Hello. -Hi.
Is there anything we can do?
No, that's it.
- Yale and Columbia, let's go.
- And Stanford.
-What? -Stanford.
It's time for them to
see this in Palo Alto.
You don't want any lunch?
No.
You're welcome to some salad.
No, thank you.
This must be hard.
Who are you?
I'm Marylin Delpy. I introduced
myself when we first...
I mean, what do you do?
I'm a second-year associate at the firm.
My boss wanted me to sit
in on the deposition phase.
What are you doing?
Checking in to see
how it's going in Bosnia.
Bosnia.
They don't have roads,
but they have Facebook.
You must really hate the Winklevosses.
I don't hate anybody.
The Winklevi aren't suing me
for intellectual property theft.
They are suing me because
for the first time in their lives,
things didn't work out the way
they were supposed to for them.
He's expanding.
What?
He's expanding to Yale,
Columbia and Stanford.
It's gonna be in The Crimson tomorrow.
-Really? -Yep.
Well, looks like that
cease-and-desist letter
really scared the
shit out of him, huh?
I wanna hire a lawyer
to file for injunctive
relief and get the
site taken down now.
Every minute the site is up, Harvard
Connection becomes less valuable.
I want an injunction. I want
damages. I want punitive relief.
And I want him dead.
Yeah, I want those things, too.
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?
No, it's because you're not
thinking how it's gonna look.
How's it gonna look?
Like my brother and I
are in skeleton costumes
chasing the Karate Kid
around a high school gym.
Cam, he's violated Massachusetts state law.
When he goes to Connecticut,
New York and California,
he'll have violated federal law.
And, by the way, he's in
violation of Harvard law.
There's no such thing as Harvard law.
Wait. Yeah, there is.
Harvard Student Handbook.
Every freshman is issued one of these,
and somewhere in this book it says...
You can't steal from another student.
This is what we needed.
We're going to Summers.
Well, you can't get a
meeting with Larry Summers.
My brother and I, we
pay tuition at this school.
We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school.
We've won trophies for this school.
And we'll be rowing in the
Olympics for this school.
I want a meeting with the
goddamn president of this school.
Why Stanford?
Why do you think?
I'm sorry.
I'm late for biochem.
Okay.
You don't know my name, do you?
Is it Stanford?
I should just kick your ass.
How do you go to a party
and you meet someone...
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer
Amy. You're from Orinda.
Your father's in commercial real
estate and your mother's 10 years sober.
What's my major?
-Trombone. -Really?
I remember something about a trombone.
French.
Your major's French.
-And yours? -Mine?
-I don't have one. -You haven't declared?
I don't go to school.
-You're kidding. -No.
Well, where did you go to school?
William Taft Elementary,
for a little while.
Seriously?
You're not like 15 years
old or anything, are you?
No.
Wait, you're not like 15, are you?
No.
So, what do you do?
I'm an entrepreneur.
-You're unemployed. -I wouldn't say that.
What would you say?
That I'm an entrepreneur.
Well, then, what was your latest preneur?
Well, I founded an
Internet company that
let folks download and
share music for free.
Kind of like Napster?
Exactly like Napster.
What do you mean?
I founded Napster.
Sean Parker founded Napster.
Nice to meet you.
You're Sean Parker?
You see, the shoe's on the other...
-Foot? -Table, which has turned.
I just slept with Sean Parker?
You just slept on Sean Parker.
-You're a zillionaire. -Not technically.
What are you?
Broke. There's not a lot
of money in free music,
even less when you're being sued by
everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.
This is blowing my mind.
I appreciate that.
I gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.
Biochem, even though you're a
French major whose name is Amy.
You passed.
I'm a hard worker.
There's juice or anything
else you can find. Help yourself.
You mind if I check my e-mail?
Yeah, go ahead.
Amy!
Jesus.
-Amy! Can you come out here? -Yeah?
Just a second.
There's a snake in here, Amy.
What?
Where?
There isn't a snake, but I
need to ask you something.
Are you kidding me? I could've been killed.
How?
By running too fast and
getting twisted in the curtain.
What do you need to ask me?
Yeah, I went to check my e-mail and
there's a website open on your computer.
Yeah, after you passed out last night
I went on The Facebook for a little bit.
-What's that? -The Facebook?
Stanford's had it for, like, two weeks now.
It's really awesome, except
it's freakishly addictive.
Seriously, I'm on the
thing like five times a day.
Mind if I send myself an e-mail?
Yeah, is everything okay?
Everything's great.
I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.
I've never been in this building before.
This building's 100 years older than
the country it's in, so do be careful.
We're sitting in chairs.
Yes.
Very good. You can go in now.
That's their own stupidity.
I should've been there.
Well, darkness is the absence of light,
and the stupidity in that
instance was the absence of me.
Catherine, I've got
students in my office now.
Students. Undergrads.
I don't know.
From the looks of it, they want to
sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.
All right, bye-bye.
-Good morning. -Good morning, sir.
I'm Cameron Winklevoss
and this is my brother, Tyler.
And you're here because...
Either of you can answer.
I'm sorry, sir, I thought
you were reading the letter.
I've read the letter.
Well, we came up with an idea for a
website called Harvard Connection...
We've since changed the name to ConnectU.
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea...
I understand.
And I'm asking what you
want me to do about it.
Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman,
under the heading "Standards of
Conduct in the Harvard Community,"
it says the college expects all
students to be honest and forthcoming
in their dealings with
members in this community.
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership,
and instances of theft,
misappropriation or...
-Anne? -Yes, sir?
Punch me in the face. Go ahead.
Or unauthorized use will
result in disciplinary action,
including the requirement
to withdraw from the college.
And you memorized that
instead of doing what?
What my brother and I came here today
to ask of you, respectfully, of course...
Sir, it's against university rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple.
And you've spoken to your House Master?
Yes, sir. And the House Master made
a recommendation to the Ad Board,
but the Ad Board won't see us.
Have you tried dealing with
the other student directly?
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding
to any of our e-mails or phone calls
for the last two weeks.
He doesn't answer when we
knock on his door at Kirkland,
and the closest I've come to
dealing with him face-to-face
is when I saw him on the quad and
chased him through Harvard Square.
You chased him?
I saw him and I know he saw me. I
went after him and then he disappeared.
- I don't see this as a university issue.
- Of course this is a university issue.
There's a code of ethics and an
honor code and he violated them both.
You enter into a code of ethics with
the university, not with each other.
I'm sorry, President Summers, but what
you just said makes no sense to me at all.
I'm devastated by that.
What my brother means is, if Mark
Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room
and stole our computer, that
would be a university issue.
I really don't know. This office
doesn't handle petty larceny.
This isn't petty larceny.
This idea is potentially
worth millions of dollars.
-Millions? -Yes.
You might just be letting your
imaginations run away with you.
Sir, I honestly don't think you're
in any position to make that call.
I was the US Treasury Secretary.
I'm in some position to make that call.
Letting our imaginations run away with us
is exactly what we were told
to do in your freshman address.
Well, then I would suggest
that you let your imaginations
run away with you on a new project.
You would?
Yes. Everyone at Harvard's
inventing something.
Harvard undergraduates
believe that
inventing a job is
better than finding a job.
So I'll suggest again that the two of
you come up with a new new project.
- I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point.
- Please, arrive at the point.
You don't have to be an
intellectual property expert
to understand the difference
between right and wrong.
And you're saying that I don't?
- Of course I'm not saying that, sir.
- I'm saying that.
-Really? -Sir.
Anne, how did they get this appointment?
Colleagues of their father.
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss,
since you're on the
subject of right and wrong.
This action, this meeting, the
two of you being here is wrong.
It's not worthy of Harvard. It's
not what Harvard saw in you.
You don't get special treatment.
- We never asked...
- Just start another project?
Like we're making a
diorama for a science fair?
If you have a problem
with that, Mr. Winklevoss...
We never asked for special treatment.
The courts are always at your disposal.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
You can take the Harvard
Student Handbook and shove it...
Ty.
Thank you very much for your time, sir.
Whoops.
Broke your 335-year-old doorknob.
Eduardo, spring break, you and
Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.
-Yes. -What was the purpose of the trip?
Well, as CFO, I had set up some
meetings with potential advertisers.
Who paid for the trip?
It was paid for out of the $1,account I had set up a few months earlier.
At this point, your $1,000 was the only
money that had been put into the company?
-Yes. -How did you feel the meetings went?
-They went terribly. -Why?
Mark was asleep.
I was not asleep.
Can I rephrase my answer?
I wish he'd been asleep.
So we're in 29 schools now,
with over 75,000 members.
People who go on The Facebook
tend to stay on longer than
almost any other website.
Now, here's the most impressive statistic.
91% of people who try
it once will come back.
- Now, if you'll allow me...
- Excuse me one second.
What sound is he
making? Is that like a tsk?
It wasn't a tsk.
It was...
Like a glottal stop.
Almost a gag reflex.
Guys, what is this?
There was one more meeting
scheduled for the New York trip.
Yes, it was a dinner.
It was set up through
my girlfriend at the time.
Would you say that Mark
was excited about this meeting?
Yes. Very.
- Look, they're not gonna card us.
- They might.
- I mean, look around.
- It'll be embarrassing.
- Tell him they're not gonna card us.
- They're not gonna card us.
- Mark...
- Are you gonna talk about ads again?
Unless you're the
ballet theater of Hartford,
the purpose of a
business is to make a profit.
It isn't a business yet.
That's tough for me,
'cause my... Never mind.
He's 25 minutes late.
He founded Napster when
he was 19. He can be late.
-He's not a god. -Then what is he?
He's 25 minutes late.
I think Wardo's jealous.
I honestly wasn't jealous. I was nervous.
Why?
Well, I didn't know him at all, but I
had done a search and I'd asked around.
And he struck me as kind of a...
A wild card.
Why?
He crashed out of two pretty big
Internet companies in spectacular fashion,
he's had a reputation with drugs...
He also founded the companies.
We don't need him.
He's here.
No, no, take your time.
-And he does own a watch. -Stop it.
-I'm Sean Parker. -How do you do?
You must be Eduardo. And Christy. And Mark.
-Great to meet you. -Great to meet you.
You guys don't have
anything in front of you.
-No. -Tori.
We were waiting.
- Hey, baby boy.
- Can you bring out some things?
The lacquered pork with that
ginger con fit. Tuna tartare?
And the lobster claws,
that'll get us started.
Christy, what do you like to drink?
An appletini.
Great. Four of those.
From that point on, it was a Seanathon.
The question was,
"What did you talk about?"
He took us through his
episode with Napster.
I didn't wanna spend my 20s
as a professional defendant.
Who knew? The music industry
doesn't have a sense of humor.
We tried to sell the company to pay the
35 million they said we owed in royalties,
but I guess to them
that was a little like
selling a stolen car to
pay for the stolen gas.
So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy.
- But you made a name for yourself.
- And you are dry.
-Tori! -No, no, I'm good.
And then he went on to
his second business venture,
which was an online Rolodex that
he got thrown out of by Case Equity.
And I wanted to do it nice this time.
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes,
but nobody wants to take orders from a kid.
So let me tell you what happens to a
20-year-old at the top of a hot dot-com.
- I'm not a psychiatrist, but...
- I'm glad we've got that on the record.
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?
A psychiatrist would
say that he was paranoid.
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.
You're a target for high-priced escorts.
I can't prove it, but I
know they tap my phones.
Whatever it is that's gonna
trip you up, you've done already.
Private behavior is a
relic of a time gone by.
And if somehow, someway, you've managed
to live your life like the Dalai Lama,
they'll make shit up.
Because they don't want
you, they want your idea.
And they want you to
say "thank you" while you...
Excuse me.
Wipe your chin and walk away.
That's what happened to you?
And delusional.
Yes. But there'll be payback at Case.
I brought down the record
companies with Napster
and Case'll suffer for their sins, too.
Sorry, you didn't bring
down the record companies.
They won.
-In court. -Yeah.
You wanna buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?
And he told story after story
about life in Silicon Valley,
and parties at Stanford and down in LA,
and friends who'd become millionaires...
But mostly how Mark had to...
He had to come to California.
And then he got around to The Facebook.
So, tell me about your progress.
Well, we're in 29 schools now.
We got over 75,000 members.
- Tell me about the strategy you're using.
- Okay.
For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas,
but Baylor already had a
social network on campus.
So instead of going right after them,
we made a list of every
school within 100 miles...
You put The Facebook
on those campuses first.
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw
their friends on our site and we were in.
It's called the Little
Bighorn. That's smart, Mark.
-Thanks, that was mine. -Easy.
Hey, you know what?
Settle an argument for us.
I say it's time to start making
money from The Facebook,
but Mark doesn't want
advertising. Who's right?
Well...
Neither of you yet.
The Facebook is cool,
that's what it's got going for it.
Yeah.
You don't wanna ruin it with
ads because ads aren't cool.
Exactly.
It's like you're throwing the
greatest party on campus
and someone's saying
it's gotta be over by 11:00.
That's exactly right.
You don't even know
what the thing is yet.
Exactly.
How big it can get, how far it can go.
This is no time to take your chips down.
A million dollars isn't
cool. You know what's cool?
You?
"A billion dollars."
And that shut everybody up.
And that's where you're
headed. A billion-dollar valuation.
Unless you take bad advice, in which
case you may as well have come up with
a chain of very successful yogurt shops.
When you go fishing, you can catch
a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.
You ever walk into a guy's den and see
a picture of him standing next to 14 trout?
- No, he's holding a 3,000-pound marlin.
- Yep.
-That's a good analogy. -Okay.
But we all know marlins don't
really weigh 3,000 pounds, right?
Have you seen the big ones up close?
No, but I don't think the guy's holding
a marlin the size of a Range Rover.
That would be a really big
fish and a very strong guy.
You think we might be
getting away from the point?
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.
He owned Mark after that dinner.
He picked up the check, he
told Mark they'd talk again soon,
and he was gone.
But not before he made his
biggest contribution to the company.
Drop the "The." Just "Facebook."
It's cleaner.
Shit.
Goodbye, sweetie.
Yeah.
That's gotta be some kind of
land speed record for talking.
You wanna end the party at 11:00.
- I'm trying to pay for the party.
- There won't be a party unless it's cool.
So, what do you think?
Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The."
I meant to catching the
marlin instead of the 14 trout.
Doesn't that sound good?
If you're a trout.
I'm going to enter this into the record.
Incorporation papers for Facebook,
an LLC registered in Florida.
-Why Florida? -It's where my family lives.
And ask the respondent to stipulate
that the articles of incorporation
state the ownership as follows:
65% for Mark Zuckerberg,
30% for Eduardo Saverin
and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz.
Yeah, we stipulate.
- And that was April 13th, 2004.
- You can mark it.
You have anything here?
Yes. Thank you.
Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything
that might be considered
legitimate grounds for termination?
No.
You never did anything to embarrass the
company or even seriously jeopardize it?
-No. -No?
No.
You were accused of animal cruelty.
-Wait. -You weren't?
This is not happening.
I have here an article from The Crimson...
Jesus Christ.
I can't have this, Wardo.
Come on, man. This is bullshit.
This is another club playing a prank.
I'd gotten into the Phoenix.
I'd been accepted, and as
part of my initiation I had to,
for one week, carry with me at all
times and take care of a chicken.
They identify you as one
of the founders of Facebook.
"Junior Eduardo Saverin..."
I'm not the expert, but being
connected to torturing animals
is probably bad for business.
I did not torture the chicken. I
don't torture chickens. Are you crazy?
No, and settle down, please. I have
here an article from The Crimson...
-This is scathing. -956.
I was having dinner in the
Kirkland dining hall with Mark,
and I had the chicken with me,
because I had to have the
chicken with me at all times.
This was college.
- Somebody's gonna have to answer for this.
- 969.
And the dining hall was
serving chicken for dinner,
and I had to feed my chicken, so I...
Well, I took little pieces of
chicken and I gave it to the chicken.
Someone must have seen me,
because the next thing I knew
I was being accused of forced cannibalism.
I didn't know you couldn't do that.
I dealt with the various
animal rights groups,
I dealt with the associate
dean of the college.
This was all resolved.
088.
Someone from the Porc or
the Fly must have reported it.
For all I know, it was the Winklevosses.
All right, let's just forget about it.
This is absurd. I'm being
accused of animal cruelty.
It's better to be accused of necrophilia.
It is better to be accused of necrophilia.
Now I have to explain
this to my father.
I'm gonna have to
explain this to everybody.
What is happening on that?
I have my final coming up for
Postwar and Contemporary Art
and I haven't been to class.
I'm supposed to write
about these four paintings.
That's a Facebook page?
Yeah. I opened it under an alias.
I posted the paintings and
asked people to comment.
Every once in a while, I hop on and
stir the pot to get a good debate going.
Mr. Zuckerberg was
cheating on his final exam?
- I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.
- And why not?
Because I'm not suing him
for cheating on his final exam.
- That's not what friends do.
- Well, you just told us he was cheating.
Oops.
You told your lawyers I
was torturing animals?
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.
Our litigators are capable
of finding a Crimson article.
In fact, when we raised the
subject with him, he defended you.
Oops.
993. We are so close.
Yeah, that reminds me, we're
gonna need more money, Wardo.
Yeah, no, I agree. More servers, more help.
I'm interviewing two
interns to come to Palo Alto
and we're gonna have to pay them something.
- Sorry, what?
- I already found a house for rent
on a street two blocks
from the Stanford campus.
It is perfect and it's got a pool.
When did you decide to go
to California for the summer?
You mean when did I actually decide?
Was it somewhere in the middle
of the Sean Parker Variety Hour?
He was right, California's
the place we've gotta be.
What, you're Jed Clampett?
I didn't know you guys got
The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil.
Yeah, got the show
in Brazil, it was genius.
- What is your problem with Sean?
- He doesn't bring anything to the table.
He doesn't have money.
Dustin's a better programmer.
- He's got connections to VCs.
- We don't need VCs, we need advertisers.
- And I have connections to VCs.
- No real players.
And as somebody who's just really
embarrassed the company in a bad way...
-It was the Winklevosses, Mark. -Hang on.
Hit "Refresh."
150,004.
150,000 members, Wardo.
-Congratulations, dude. -Congratulations.
You don't think it was strange that
he was followed by private detectives?
Who came up with nothing.
Enough to get him out of the
company. The drugs, the girls.
- We don't know that any of that's true.
- You can read about it.
I can read about you
torturing birds. Since when...
Okay, don't fish eat other
fish? The marlins and the trout?
What's he talking about?
I'm interviewing interns at 10:tomorrow night in the CS lab.
Get on board with this, man.
You know, I don't really
know what else to say.
You can do one more! One more!
Wardo!
Yo! Mark!
What's going on?
They have 10 minutes to get
root access to a Python web server,
expose its SSL encryption,
and then intercept all
traffic over its secure port.
They're hacking.
Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall
Emulator. But here's the beauty.
You know I didn't understand
anything you just said, right?
- I do know that. -So what's the beauty?
Every tenth line of code
written, they have to drink a shot.
Hacking's supposed to be stealth, so
every time the server detects an intrusion,
the candidate responsible
has to drink a shot.
I also have a program running
that has a pop-up window
appear simultaneously
on all five computers.
The last candidate to hit the
window has to drink a shot.
Plus, every three minutes
they all have to drink a shot.
-Three minutes! -Drink one now!
Hey, can I ask, what part of the intern's
job will they need to be able to do drunk?
You're right.
A more relevant test might be seeing if
they can keep a chicken alive for a week.
-That was mean. -Here.
What is this?
I opened a new account
and put $18,000 in it.
Will that get you through the summer?
-Here! -Mark?
Right here!
Welcome to Facebook.
-$18,0007? -Yes.
In addition to the $1,you'd already put up.
-Yes. -A total of $19,000 now.
-Yes. -Hang on.
I'm just checking your math on that.
Yes, I got the same thing.
May I continue?
After expressing misgivings about
Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company
and moving it to California for the summer,
why did you put $18,in an account for his use?
I figured we were partners. I
wanted to be a team player.
I figured Mark, Dustin and the
new interns could work on the site
while I was generating
advertiser interest in New York.
But mostly I figured, how much could
possibly go wrong in three months?
Go, go, go, go, go.
- Didn't die. -I know.
-I made it. -You did.
Okay, ready?
-That was like an 8. -That was like a 2.
-It was better than that. -Yeah.
I'm okay.
-You sure? -Yeah.
Yikes.
That's the doorbell.
I didn't know we had a doorbell.
-Andrew, get the door! -No, he's wired in.
That's gonna cut into
your security deposit.
-Andrew. -Not now.
Good boy.
-Sean? -Mark?
-Do you live here? -Yeah.
Do you?
We were right across the
street. We saw the chimney...
- Is anybody hurt?
- No. You live across the street?
I'm Sharon.
This is my... Sharon.
She lives across the street.
I was helping her move
out, we saw the chimney...
We had a zip line to the pool.
You came to California.
Yeah.
You made the right choice.
Here you go.
Sharon?
I'm so sorry.
- No problem.
- I didn't know you were gonna...
-Here you go. -No, no, no. Wait!
This house and this team are
great. It's exactly what it should be.
I'm Sean Parker.
Oh, he's wired in.
That's what I'm talking about.
Where's Eduardo?
He got an internship in New York.
Eduardo didn't come out?
I was crashing there for a little bit
while I'm taking care of some things,
but she's done for the summer
so she's back at her parents' place.
- The homeless rock star of Palo Alto.
- All right.
What's your plan for the summer?
Mark?
I'm sorry. I was looking
at the architecture.
I asked what your plan for the...
A hundred schools by the end of the summer.
-We're gonna go to the restroom. -Okay.
Yeah, I'll go with you.
Your date looks so familiar to me.
She looks familiar to a lot of people.
What do you mean?
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife some lingerie,
but he's too embarrassed to
shop for it in a department store.
He comes up with an
idea for a high-end place
that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.
He gets a $40,000 bank loan,
borrows another 40,000 from his in-laws,
opens a store and
calls it Victoria's Secret.
Makes a half million
dollars his first year.
Starts a catalog, opens three more stores,
and after five years, he sells the company
to Leslie Wexner and
The Limited for $4 million.
Happy ending, right?
Except two years later, the
company's worth $500 million,
and Roy Raymond jumps
off the Golden Gate Bridge.
Poor guy just wanted to buy his
wife a pair of thigh-highs, you know?
Was that a parable?
My date's a Victoria's Secret model.
That's why she looks familiar to you.
-God. -Don't be impressed by all this.
I read your blog.
You know, no, that was for web cretins.
You know why I started Napster?
The girl I loved in
high school was with
the co-captain of the
varsity lacrosse team,
and I wanted to take her from him.
So I decided to come
up with the next big thing.
- I didn't know that.
- Napster wasn't a failure.
I changed the music industry
for better and for always.
It may not have been good business,
but it pissed a lot of people off.
And isn't that what your
Facemash was about?
They're scared of me, pal, and
they're gonna be scared of you.
What the VCs want is to say,
"Good idea, kid, the
grown-ups will take it from here."
But not this time. This is our time.
This time, you're gonna hand
them a business card that says,
"I'm CEO, bitch."
That's what I want for you.
So where the hell is Eduardo?
-He's in New York. -Sucking up to ad execs.
-He's got an... -An internship.
The company's here. A
billion-dollar company's here.
-Do you live and breathe Facebook? -Yes.
I know you do.
Wardo wants to be a businessman and
for all I know he's gonna be a good one,
but he shouldn't be in New York
kissing Madison Avenue's ass.
This is a once-in-a-generation,
"holy shit" idea.
And the water under the
Golden Gate is freezing cold.
Look at my face and tell me I
don't know what I'm talking about.
Do you ever think about that girl?
What girl?
The girl from high school
with the lacrosse thing.
No.
If you guys are gonna talk
about bandwidth, we need shots.
A hundred schools by the end of the summer?
Yeah.
Tell you what. Gesture of good faith.
While you're getting into schools, I'll put you on two continents.
Two...
If you don't have a place to crash,
I think you should definitely
come and live with us.
Let's line up some shots.
-Excuse me! -Yes, Sir.
You can take this away
and bring back the 1942.
Absolutely, Mr. Parker.
Attention... Go!
At the barrier, Hollandia is leading
Harvard University by one length.
Approaching the grandstands,
Hollandia maintains a lead
of three-quarters of a length.
Come on!
Whatever.
-Mr. Winklevoss. -Tyler.
-Tremendous race. -Thank you.
- And this is my brother, Cameron.
- Excellent.
Sir?
His Royal Highness Prince Albert.
Your Highness, this is
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.
Of course. Brilliant race. I've
never seen a race that close.
Yes, Your Highness.
My grandfather, Jack Kelly, was
one of the premier rowers of his day.
I've been coming to Henley for years and I'd never seen a race that close.
Have you? Have you seen a race that close?
No, Your Highness.
Mile-and-a-half races are more
commonly won by a boat length or two.
Yes, that's absolutely
right. Brutally close.
May I introduce my teammates?
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse us.
On to the Dutch.
Sorry you flew all the
way out here to see that.
Wouldn't have missed it,
brother. How was the royalty?
I just wanted him to tell me a couple
more times how close the race was.
Just brutal, brutally close.
Brutally excruciating. Jesus.
The guy is the prince of a
country the size of Nantucket.
Relax, it's fine.
-Boys. Div ya. -Dad.
-Mr. Winklevoss. -That was a tough beat.
I'm sorry that you and Mom
had to fly out here to see that.
No, don't ever apologize to
me for losing a race like that.
Don't ever apologize to
anyone for losing a race like that.
-Boys. -Mr. Kenwright.
Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright, head
of the host family for this week.
-Pleasure to meet you. -Good to meet you.
I've just had a phone
chat with my daughter.
She told me that she and her friends
are already talking about the race,
which they've just
seen via their computers.
A new website called Facebook.
Do you have this in America?
I'm gonna find your mother.
Have I said something wrong?
Your daughter doesn't
go to school in the States?
No, no. Cambridge.
Majoring in French literature, though
I wasn't aware there was such a thing.
And they have Facebook at Cambridge?
And apparently Oxford and
the London School of Economics.
That's where her friends are.
That's awesome.
Good race, boys. Take
the bitter with the better, en?
I'm gonna go watch the race film.
If this is online, I wanna see it.
Stop it.
Stop it, Cam.
Knock it off.
I don't mind that we lost to the
Dutch today by less than a second.
That was a good race,
and that was a fair race.
And they'll see us again.
What I mind, and what you should mind,
is showing up on Monday for
a race that was run on Sunday.
We tried talking to him
ourselves, we tried writing a letter,
we tried the Ad Board, and we tried
talking to the president of the university.
Now, I am asking you for the last time,
let's take the considerable resources at
our disposal and sue him in federal court.
Come on.
I need a real drink.
Screw it.
Let's gut the friggin' nerd.
That's what I'm talking about!
No, no, no, no, no.
But check it out, I saw him today.
Manningham, Mitchell
Manningham, my Case Equity guy.
Hang on.
Are you guys using
Spikes or Ghost Missiles?
We don't know, we're
just shooting at each other.
Use Sweet Kamikazes.
Like we know what that is.
I saw him getting into his Turbo
Carrera and he saw me, too.
I know he did.
Don't. Don't sweat it. I'm on a landline.
Bong hit.
Does anybody hear that banging?
You don't hear anything.
You're writing code.
Dude, somebody's at the door.
It's not a dish best served cold. It's
best served immediately and relentlessly.
I'm gonna call you back.
What's up?
What's up?
Mark was supposed to pick
me up at the airport an hour ago.
I've been calling his cell.
He was on a 36-hour coding tear,
so he took a nap for a couple of hours.
What happened here?
Not happened. Happening.
The next big thing.
Wardo.
Hey, man.
-Back to work. -Okay.
The more bad I get at
this, the more wasted I get.
I mean the more wasted that I get...
We understand.
How old are they, Sean?
It's not polite to ask.
Sean, how old are they?
You think you know me, right?
I've read enough.
You know how much I've read about you?
Nothing.
-Wardo. -Hey, man.
- I waited an hour for you at the airport.
- What time is it?
It's midnight. Or 3:00 a.m. in
New York, where I just came from.
You gotta see some of the new stuff
we got. Hey, Dustin. Show him the Wall.
I'm just calling it the Wall.
Forget the Wall, tell him about
the meeting I've got set up.
You know Peter Thiel?
-Nope. -No reason you should.
He just runs a $2-billion hedge
fund called Clarium Capital.
Why's he setting up meetings?
Thiel might wanna make an angel investment.
I don't care if he's an actual angel.
Why is he setting up business meetings?
You've had a long flight.
No, I had a long wait
on the tarmac at JFK,
then a long wait at the passenger
loading and unloading zone at SFO,
and in between there was a long flight.
I'm the business end of this company.
And he is a house
guest living here rent free
on a very generous grant from
the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.
I heard about your big-ticket
ad buys. Gary's Tuxedos.
-Hey, man... -Harvard Bartending Course.
You're just a small step away from
bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.
- You wanna talk to me alone for a minute?
- Sure.
Bong hit.
-I'm so high. -No, you're not.
So how's it going?
How's the internship? How's Christy?
-How's the internship? -Yeah.
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship.
We talked about this on the
phone. I quit on my first day.
I do remember you saying that.
So how is Christy?
Christy's crazy.
-Is that fun? -No.
I mean, she's actually psychotic.
She's insanely jealous, she's
irrational, and I'm frightened of her.
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.
I do not want that guy representing
himself as part of this company.
You gotta move out here, Wardo,
this is where it's all happening.
- Did you hear what I just said?
- The connections, the energy...
Mark, you got...
I'm afraid if you don't come out
here, you're gonna get left behind.
I want... I need you out here.
- Please don't tell him I said that.
- What did you just say?
It's moving faster than any
of us ever imagined it would.
-It's moving fast. -What did you mean?
- And Sean thinks we have...
- Sean is not part of this company.
We have over 300,000 members, Wardo,
and we're in 160 schools,
including five in Europe.
I'm aware of that! Mark, I am the CFO!
We need more servers than
I ever expected we'd need.
We need more programmers
and we need more money,
and he set up the Thiel meeting.
He set up meetings all over town.
-He set up other meetings? -Yes.
- Without me knowing anything about it.
- You're in New York.
I'm in New York riding subways hours a day, trying to find advertisers!
And how's it going so far?
What did you mean, "get left behind"?
-Hi. -Can I help you?
I'd like to freeze this bank account
and cancel all existing
checks and lines of credit.
- May I see some ID, please?
- Yeah, sure, sorry.
Sean, he'll be right with you.
No problem.
You know this is where
they filmed Towering Inferno?
That's comforting.
Hey, guys. Come on back.
- She offer you some waters?
- Oh, yeah. We're cool.
Sean, how are you? Come on in.
-You must be Mark. -Hi.
We took a look at everything,
and congratulations.
We're gonna start you off
with a $500,000 investment.
Maurice is gonna talk to you
about some corporate restructuring.
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware
and come up with a stock structure
that allows for new investors.
Now, let me ask you something.
Who's Eduardo Saverin?
Jesus Christ.
When did you get back?
You scared me. I need you to knock.
When did you get back?
I got back this afternoon.
And when were you gonna call me?
Chris, it was kind of a
rough trip and I was tired...
Yeah, or answer one of my texts. Did you know I sent 47 texts?
I did, and I thought that was
incredibly normal behavior.
Are you mocking me?
I brought you a present.
Why does your Status say
"single" on your Facebook page?
What?
Why does your Relationship Status
say "single" on your Facebook page?
Well, I was single when I set up the page.
And you just never bothered to change it?
What?
I don't know how.
Do I look stupid to you?
No, calm down.
You're asking me to believe
that the CFO of Facebook
doesn't know how to change his
Relationship Status on Facebook?
It's embarrassing, so you should take it as
a sign of trust that I would tell you that.
-Go to hell. -Take it easy.
No, you didn't change it so you
could screw those Silicon Valley sluts
every time you go out to see Mark.
Not even remotely true, and I can
promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts
don't care what anyone's
Relationship Status is on Facebook.
Please, open your present.
Your phone does work.
It's Mark.
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.
Open your present. It's a silk scarf.
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?
This'll be your first.
Yeah.
-You froze our account? - I did.
- You froze the account.
- I had to get your attention, Mark.
Do you realize that you
jeopardized the entire company?
Do you realize that your
actions could have destroyed
everything I've been working on?
We have been working on.
Without money, the site can't function.
Let me tell you the difference
between Facebook and everybody else.
We don't crash ever!
If the servers are
down for even a day, our
entire reputation is
irreversibly destroyed.
Look...
Users are fickle.
Friendster has proved that.
Even a few people leaving would
reverberate through the entire user base.
The users are interconnected.
That is the whole point.
College kids are online
because their friends are online
and if one domino goes,
the other dominos go.
Don't you get that?
I am not going back to the
Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi!
Holy shit.
What is wrong with you?
Did you like being nobody?
Did you like being a joke?
Do you wanna go back to that?
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
That was the act of a
child, not a businessman,
and it certainly was
not the act of a friend.
You know how embarrassing it was
for me to try to cash a check today?
I am not going back to that life.
-Maybe you were frustrated. -Yeah!
-Maybe you were angry. -I was!
But I am willing to let bygones be bygones,
because, Wardo, I've got some good news.
I'm sorry.
I was angry, and maybe it was
childish, but I had to get your attention.
Wardo, I said I've got some good news.
What is it?
Peter Thiel just made an angel
investment of half a million dollars.
What?
Half a million dollars. And
he's setting us up in an office.
They wanna reincorporate the
company. They wanna meet you.
They need your signature on some documents,
SO you gotta get your ass on the
first flight back to San Francisco.
I need my CFO.
I'm on my way.
-Wardo? -Yeah?
We did it.
Wardo?
You're going back there already?
Yes.
And also, I'm breaking up with you.
Somebody stop her!
Four documents.
The first two are common
stock purchase agreements,
allowing you to buy stock in the
newly reincorporated Facebook,
as opposed to the old shares,
which are now worthless.
The third is an exchange agreement
allowing you to exchange
the old shares for new shares,
and then finally a voter holding agreement.
How many shares of stock will I own?
1,328,334.
Jesus Christ.
That represents a 34.4% ownership share.
Why the increase from the original 30%?
"Cause you may need to dilute it
to award shares to new investors.
- I love working with business majors.
- I'm telling you.
-Economics. -Right.
You should know that Mark has already
taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.
Well, Mark doesn't care about
money and he needs to be protected.
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81%.
Sean Parker, 6.47%.
I can live with that.
And Peter Thiel, 7%.
Would you like to use my pen?
Eduardo? Eduardo?
Can you please repeat the question?
No, it was an outrageously
leading question the first time around,
and now you want us to hear it twice?
Yes. Would you read it back, please?
Well, go ahead.
"Counsel: 'And when you
signed these documents,
"'were you aware that you were
signing your own death certificate?"
No.
It was insanely stupid of me not to
have my own lawyers look over all the...
In all honesty, I thought
they were my lawyers.
I was your only friend.
You had one friend.
My father won't even look at me.
Okay, Eduardo, did
Mr. Zuckerberg say
anything to you after
you signed the papers?
There was a lot of handshaking,
a lot of congratulations.
He'd already told me that he wouldn't be
coming back to school
for at least a semester,
So we were saying goodbye for a while.
And then before I left he said...
But you gotta come back.
Somewhere around the end of
November or early December.
Peter wants to throw us an amazing
party when we hit a million members.
It's gonna be out of control.
You gotta come back for it.
A million members?
Yeah.
Remember the algorithm
on the window at Kirkland?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be here.
You sure about this?
You're 20 minutes late.
You're gonna walk in
there and say you overslept
and didn't have time to get dressed.
They're gonna pitch you.
Case Equity is going to pitch you.
They're gonna beg you to take their money.
You're gonna nod, you're
gonna nod, you're gonna nod,
and then you're gonna say,
"Which one of you is Roth?"
No, not Roth. Manningham.
"Which one of you is Mitchell
Manningham?" And he'll say, "I am."
And then you say, "Sean
Parker says, 'Fuck you."
Walk out.
Okay.
In late November, I
got the e-mail from Mark
telling me to come out for
the millionth-member party.
What else did the e-mail say?
It said that we had to
have a business meeting.
That Mark and Sean had played some
kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity,
and that Manningham was so impressed
that he was now making an investment
offer that was hard to turn down.
So I went to California, and I
went straight to the new offices.
I didn't know whether to dress for
the party or for the business meeting,
so I kind of dressed for both.
-But it didn't matter. -Why not?
Because I wasn't called
out there for either one.
What were you called out there for?
An ambush.
Mr. Saverin. Hey. Right over here.
Hey, man.
-How are you? -Good. How are you?
- Good, good, good, good, good.
- Good to see you.
At first I thought he was joking.
Giving me more contracts to sign.
But then I started reading.
Wait, what is this?
Well, as you know, we had some
new investors that have come in.
What is this?
Mr. Saverin.
Mark!
-Mark? -He's wired in.
-Sorry? -He's wired in.
-Is he? -Yes.
- How about now? Are you still wired in?
- Call security.
You issued 24 million new shares of stock!
You were told that if new
investors came along...
How much were your shares
diluted? How much were his?
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's
ownership share diluted down to?
It wasn't.
What was Mr. Moskovitz's
ownership share diluted down to?
It wasn't.
What was Sean Parker's
ownership share diluted down to?
It wasn't.
What was Peter Thiel's
ownership share diluted down to?
It wasn't.
And what was your ownership
share diluted down to?
.03%
-You signed the papers. -You set me up.
You're gonna blame me because you
were the business head of the company,
and you made a bad business
deal with your own company?
It's gonna be like I'm
not a part of Facebook.
It won't be like you're
not a part of Facebook.
You're not a part of Facebook.
- My name's on the masthead.
- You might wanna check again.
This because I froze the account?
You think we'd let you parade
around in your ridiculous suits,
pretending you were running this company?
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's!
Along with my hoodie and my fuck-you
flip-flops, you pretentious douche bag!
Security's here. You'll be leaving now.
- I'm not signing those papers.
- We will get the signature.
Tell me this isn't about
me getting into the Phoenix.
You... You did it. I knew you did it.
You planted that story about the chicken!
- I didn't plant that story.
- What's he talking about?
- You had me accused of animal cruelty.
- Seriously. What the hell's the chicken?
And I'll bet what you hated the most
is that they identified me
as a co-founder of Facebook.
Which I am. You better lawyer up, asshole.
"Cause I'm not coming back for
30%. I'm coming back for everything.
- Get him out of here.
- It's okay, I'm going.
Hang on.
Almost forgot.
Here's your $19,000. I
wouldn't cash it, though.
I drew it on the account you froze.
I like standing next to you, Sean.
It makes me look so tough.
Well...
That's it, that's our
show for tonight, people.
And look, I wanna see everyone
here geared up for a party.
We're gonna walk into that
club like it's the Macy's Parade.
Mackey, put it up on the big
screen. We've gotta almost be there.
-You all right? -Yeah.
You were kind of rough on him.
That's life in the NFL.
You know you didn't have
to be that rough on him.
-Listen, I put him... -Sean!
You didn't have to be that rough on him.
He almost killed it.
I'll send flowers.
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together
a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.
Ashleigh's a sister.
-Ashleigh? -The intern.
Yeah. I know who she is. Are you guys...
Ashleigh? Me? No.
Well, a little bit.
Why?
-No. Nothing, I just... -Excuse me. Mark?
- We were just talking about you.
- Just that you're doing a really good job.
Thanks. I appreciate that.
These came in for you.
Put them on my desk.
What's the package?
Nothing.
-Mackey. -Yes, Sir.
Refresh.
Sweet!
And you're not a hugger.
I know.
One million!
Who's got champagne? Huh?
I've got champagne.
The next transformative development,
a picture-sharing application.
A place where you view pictures
that coincide with your social life.
It is the true digitalization of real life.
- You can use a CD.
- You can do it off of me.
You don't just go to a party anymore.
You go to a party with
a digital camera, and
then your friends
relive the party online.
And tagging. The idea...
- Would this be easier without the bra?
- It's worth finding out.
All right, shut the music down!
The party's over!
Everybody, go home!
I've spent hours watching
what people do when they log on.
How they check their
friends' status updates.
Wait. That's weird. Why did the music stop?
Check to see which one of their friends
changed their profiles,
changed their photos...
Seriously, what happened to the music?
We lived on farms and
then we lived in cities,
and now we're going
to live on the Internet!
Sean, stop. I think something's
going on downstairs.
Ladies and gentlemen, can I
have your attention, please?
It's time for you to go
home. The party is over.
Then it's all good.
-It's the cops. -What?
Shit! Shit.
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Okay, it's okay. Be cool.
Good to see you, Officer.
What can I do for you?
What's going on?
Was the music too loud?
We were having a celebration.
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.
I can tell them to turn the music down.
That's not mine.
Okay, we're gonna need identification.
Keep your hands where we can see them.
Oh, my God.
You got anything else in your
pockets I should know about?
No, sir. No.
-Don't be stupid, now. -I don't, I don't.
What's this?
That's an EpiPen.
-And this? -That's my inhaler.
How old are you?
Twenty-one.
Twenty-one.
-Twenty-one. -I'm 21.
Lying only makes it worse.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.
Hello.
Listen, something's happened.
Shit.
No, it's all right. It's
gonna be all right.
I posted bond, and I wasn't doing
anything. I mean, I've got allergies.
Interns.
It was just a party.
This is gonna be news, Sean.
It's gonna be online any second.
I know.
You know with an intern...
No, it's cool. I have it under control.
I will get it under control.
I will call someone and
see what the next move is.
But this is gonna be news now.
You don't think Wardo was involved, do you?
I mean, do you think... No.
Or Manningham. One of them.
Somebody. Somebody sent the
coke in there, because it got in there.
You believe me. God, this is gonna be fine.
Right?
Go home, Sean.
Mark?
Mark.
We're done for the day.
Yeah. Yeah, I was just sitting here.
What happened to Sean?
He still owns 7% of the company.
All you had all day was that salad.
Do you wanna get something to eat?
I can't.
I'm not a bad guy.
I know that.
When there's emotional testimony,
I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.
And the other 
Perjury. Creation myths need a devil.
What happens now?
Sy and the others are having
a steak on University Avenue.
Then they'll come back up to the office,
and start working on a settlement
agreement to present to you.
-They're gonna settle? -Oh, yeah.
And you're gonna
have to pay a little extra.
Why?
So that these guys sign a
nondisclosure agreement.
They say one unflattering word about
you in public, you own their wife and kids.
I invented Facebook.
I'm talking about a jury.
I specialize in voir dire, jury selection.
What a jury sees when
they look at a defendant.
Clothes, hair, speaking
style, likeability...
Likeability.
I've been licensed to practice
law for all of 20 months,
and I could get a jury to believe
that you planted the story
about Eduardo and the chicken.
Watch what else.
Why weren't you at Sean's
sorority party that night?
You think I'm the one
that called the police?
Doesn't matter.
I asked the question, now
everybody's thinking about it.
You've lost your jury
in the first 10 minutes.
Farm animals.
Yeah.
I was drunk and angry and stupid.
-And blogging. -And blogging.
Pay them.
In the scheme of things,
it's a speeding ticket.
That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow.
Do you think anybody would mind if I
stayed and used the computer for a minute?
I can't imagine it would be a problem.
Thanks.
I appreciate your help today.
You're not an asshole, Mark.
You're just trying so hard to be.

Marvellous, marvellous.
Most enjoyable.

My wife, Emily.
Thank you. Tom Ripley.

- You were at Princeton.
Most likely you'll know our son,

- I couldn't 't help noticing the jacket.
- Yes.
Class of '56.
How is Dickie?
(Frances) We've enjoyed meeting you.
I do hope that
you'll come out and see us.
- Thank you. That's very kind.
- Both of you.
- Herbert?
- Yes, yes. I very much hope so.
Of course, Dickie's idea of music

- Oh, dear.
- He has a saxophone.
To my ear, jazz is just noise.
Just an insolent noise.
- Very nice to meet you.
- And you.
We'll see you at the shipyard.
- I hope to.
- Good.
I have to run, I'm very late!
- Ah, you were great!
- You were great.
Darling couple, aren't they?
Yes, they are.
Exceptional young man.
- Thanks a lot for the jacket.
- Thanks for filling in for me.
Take care of that wrist. Bye, Fran.

- You think so?
(# Classical piano)
Sorry. Sorry.
Sorry.
You've probably heard
Dickie's been living in Italy.
Mongibello, south of Naples.
No kind of place at all.
- (Man) Good morning, sir.
- Frank.
Marge, his young lady,
is supposedly writing
some kind of book.
God only knows what he does.
By all accounts, they spend the whole
time on the beach or in a sailboat.
That's my son's talent,
spending his allowance.
Could you ever conceive
of going to Italy, Tom?
Persuade my son to come home?
I'd pay you.
A thousand dollars.
Well, I have always wanted
to go to Europe, sir, but...
Good. Now you can go for a reason.

Charlie Parker. I know it!

- Thanks.
That thousand bucks
should come in handy.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll get that.
- Thank you.
- Sir.
You'll have a great trip. Mr Greenleaf is

I can tell you, the Greenleaf name
opens a lot of doors.

(Announcement in Italian over PA)
(Ripley) Do you speak English?
(Man) What you name, please?
- Ripley.
- Follow me. No problem.
- Here, Signor Ripley.
- Okay.
Uh, there. That one.
- This one.
- Wait, is that all? Count them.
Attenzione.
Just one suitcase, Signor Ripley?
- Si.
- Attenzione.
Oh, Customs.
(Officer speaks Italian)
- What's your secret?
- Excuse me?
No, it's just that...
You are American, aren't you?
No, it's just that...
I have so much luggage,
and you're so, um, streamlined.
It's, you know, humiliating.
(Speaks Italian)
I'm Meredith, by the way.
- Hello, I'm Dickie.
- Meredith Randall.
- Um, Dickie Greenleaf.
- Hello.
You're not the shipping Greenleafs.
Oh, trying not to be.
Trying to jump ship.
So, uh, did they put your cases
in the wrong pile?
It's just that, uh,
you were in the "R" stand.
I thought I saw you there...
My father wants me
back in New York.
He builds boats, I'd rather sail them.
So I travel under my mother's name.
- Which is...
- Emily.
I'm just kidding.
You know, the funny thing is,
I'm not Randall either.
I'm Logue.
- As in...
- As in the textile Logues.
Trying to shrug off the dress.
- I travel under my mother's name too.
- Randall.
Right.
- So, Rome, Rome, Rome.
- Oh.

(Marge) So I guess you didn't look
at my new chapter.
(Dickie) I will, Marge. I promise.
It's just been too hot.
(Marge) If I make dinner at my place
tonight, you could look at it then.
Dickie Greenleaf?
- Who's that?
- It's Tom. Tom Ripley.
Tom Ripley?
- We were at Princeton together.
- (Dickie) Okay.
Did we know each other?
Hello.
Well, I knew you, so...
I suppose you must have known me.
Princeton's like a fog.
America's like a fog.
This is Marge Sherwood.
Tom... Sorry, what is it?
- Ripley.
- How do you do?
How do you do, Marge?
- What are you doing in Mongi?
- Nothing, nothing much.
Just passing through.
- Passing through?
- Yeah.
You're so white.
Did you ever see a guy so white,
Marge?
Grey, actually.
It's just an undercoat.
- (Dickie) Say again?
- You know, a primer.
That's funny.
Margie likes that
'cause she's so white too.
Yes, I do, and you're not funny.
You should come and have lunch
with us before you go.
- Yes, Dickie?
- Sure, anytime.
Well...
...coincidence.
I don't remember him.
That's so funny.
(Dickie) Silvana! Hey!
I've been looking all over for you.
Where've you been hiding?
Today you're looking for me.
- And the rest of the week?
- You're always working.
- (Dickie) Come on. Get on.
- With the American girl?
- Huh? Hold on to me.
- I hate you.
- (Dickie) Huh?
- I hate you!
(Marge) Did you suddenly forget
where I lived?
I know. I'm late. I'm a swine.
- It's 4:00.
- I just woke up.
- Ohh.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You just woke up.
- Fausto and I took the boat out.
We were fishing,
and then it was dawn...
- We caught absolutely nothing.
- Mmm, yes, well.
We ate everything without you.
- We?
- Yes.
- Tom Ripley's here.
- Who?
- Tom. Hello.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Thought you'd disappeared.
We were gonna send out
a search party.
No, still here.
Tom was telling me
about his journey over.
Made me laugh so hard
I almost got a nosebleed.
- Is that good?
- (Whispers) Shut up.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm despicable. But I love you.
- Do you love me? Do you love me?
- I'm intruding.
Can you mix a martini?
- Sure.
- (Sighs) I'll do it.
- Oh.
- I make a fabulous martini.
(Giggles)
Everybody should have one talent.
What's yours?
Forging signatures,
telling lies,
impersonating practically anybody.
That's three. Nobody should
have more than one talent.
Okay, do an impression.
- Now?
- Yeah.
(As Herbert Greenleaf)
The only talent my son has
is for cashing his allowance.
- What?
- Oh, I like to sail.
Believe me, I love to sail.
- Instead, I make boats.
- Stop!
- Other people sail them.
- It's too much!
You're making all the hairs
on my neck stand up.
Oh, yes, jazz.
Oh, jazz. Let's face it.
It's just, uh...
It's just insolent noise.
I feel like he's here.
Horrible, like the old bastard's
here right now.
- Good.
- That's brilliant.
Brilliant!
How do you know him?
Oh, I met him in New York.
Marge! Marge, this is scary.
You've got to hear this. Meet my father,
Herbert Richard Greenleaf I.
Pleasure to meet you.
Dickie's made a fine catch.
- Uncanny!
- I know Emily thinks so.
- I don't get it.
- It's uncanny.
Could you ever conceive
of going to Italy, Tom,
and, uh, bringing him back?
- What?
- I'd pay you.
If you would go to Italy,
persuade my son to come home,
I'd pay you a thousand dollars.
(Dickie) 'I'm never going back.'
To actually hire somebody
to come all the way here,
to drag me back home...
Got to be a little insane, hasn't he?
- Ciao, Fausto.
- Oh, Dickie!
(Chat in Italian)
- This is Tom.
- Ciao, Tom.
- I'm never going back.
- No, I think...
Your mother, her illness, I think...
It's got nothing to do with my mother.
She's had leukem...
This is what makes me boil about him.
He wants me back.
He wants me back.
- It's got nothing to do with my mother.
- Look, I don't know...
Go back.
Go back to New York.
Or call him, if you can find
a telephone that works,
and tell him wild horses wouldn't
drag me back to him or his shipyard.
- Hi, Tom.
- Hi.
Marge! Tom's saying goodbye.
Oh, I'll come down.
So, uh, did you speak to my father?
Oh, you were right...
about the telephones.
- I told you.
- No lines. There's some problem.
(Dickie) That's Italy.
Tom. You're off?
What are your plans?
Oh, back, I suppose,
as slow as I can. Oh!
This bag!
Hey... you like jazz.
I love jazz.
Oh! This is the best.
Baker, Rollins.
Marge says she likes jazz,
but she thinks Glenn Miller's jazz.
- I never said that!
- Bird, that's jazz.
Bird? Ask me the name
of my sailboat.
I don't know.
What's the name of your sailboat?
Look! Look! "Bird"!
(Marge) Which is ridiculous.
Boats are female.
Everyone knows
you can't call a boat after a man.
- He's not a man. He's a god.
- Okay, we're going to Naples.
There's a club...
It's not a club, it's a cellar.
- It's vile.
- You don't have to come. It's great.
It's great. You're gonna love it.
(# Music over dialogue)
How are you?
Oh!
(Singing in Italian)
That'd be cool. Bring him up.

...Tom Ripley!
Come on! Get on up here!
(Italian)
I'll tell you when to join the chorus.
Come on.
Okay, together!
(Dickie) 'I bumped into
an old friend from Princeton.
- 'A fellow called Tom Ripley.'
- (Typewriter clacking)
'He says he's going to haunt me
until I agree
'to go back to New York with him.'
Afternoon.
What time is it?
- Oh, God.
- "Go back to New York with him.
- "Here..."
- You always type your letters?
- That should be two T's.
- I can't write, and I can't spell.
It's the privilege
of a first-class education.
Your room's upstairs at the back.
I think Ermalinda made up the bed.
- Ermalinda!
- Si?
(Both speak Italian)
- This is so good of you.
- Don't say it again.
Now that you're a double agent and
we're going to string my dad along,
what if we were to buy a car
with your expense money?
- Okay.
- Great.
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello.
Marge, Marge, what do you think?
Little Cinquecento
with my dad's money?
Oh, please, Dickie.
You can't even drive a car.
- (Tom) You can't even drive.
- What we need urgently is an icebox.
Agree with me,
and I'll be your friend for life.
- I absolutely agree with Marge.
- Hmm.
Icebox. Icebox.
(Bell tolling)
(Marge) So, what,
is he gonna move in with you?
It'll just be for a little while.
He can be... He makes me laugh.
- (Marge) Okay, darling.
- Promise you'd say?
- No, I like him.
- Marge, you like everybody.
(Marge) Don't like you. Ha-ha!
Then I'll go to your place
and you can move in with Tom.
(Ripley mimics Marge) I like him.
(Mimics Dickie)
Marge, you like everybody.
(Mimics Marge) No, I like him.
(Mimics Dickie)
Marge, you like everybody.
(Dickie) Now you'll find out why
Marge always shows up for breakfast.
It's not love,
it's my coffee machine!
(Marge) Ever since Ermalinda showed
him how to make his own espresso,
he feels like quite the grown-up.
(Dickie) I bought the coffee machine.
(Marge) Oh, darling, is that for me?
This is for Tom,
because he didn't complain.
(Tom) That ring is superb.
Oh, Tom, I love you. See?
Ooh! I had to promise, capital "P",
never to take it off.
- Otherwise, I'd give it to you.
- Isn't it great? I found it in Naples.
I had to bargain for it
for about two weeks.
I hope it wasn't cheap, Marge.
- Oh, it was.
- Ha-ha(!)
I have to get a birthday present for
Frances, so perhaps you could help me.
- Who's Frances?
- My fiancÃ©e.
Ahem! Engaged?
You're a dark horse, Ripley.
- Who is she?
- Your parents met her.
Oh, God.
Oh, I can just imagine.
"If only Dickie would settle down.
"Doesn't every parent
deserve a grandchild?"
Oh, God. Never. Never.
I swear on your ring, Marge,
I'm never going back.
(Tom) Say when to pull.
(Dickie) Pull now. Pull.
It's not pulling.
I'm doing it wrong.
- Better now, huh?
- Okay, okay, okay.
We'll make a sailor of you yet!
You're doing really well.
- All right, bar's open.
- Yes, please.
- Hey, can we sail to Venice?
- Sure. I love Venice.
"See Venice and die."
Isn't that right? Or is it Rome?
- Is it Rome?
- I have to see Venice.
You do something and die, don't you?
Okay. Venice is on the list.
And Rome.
Do you ski?
Ah, no, no. Don't tell me.
You're a lost cause.
That's the next thing to deal with.
Christmas, we're planning
a skiing trip to Cortina.
Excellent skiing. Excellent.
Marge. Margie.
Unbelievable, Tom can't ski either.
- We'll have to teach him that too.
- Thank you.
Such little class, Marge.
Does this guy know anything?
It's a good thing
we're not getting married soon.
We'd have to invite Tom
on our honeymoon.
(Marge) 'Oh, I hated New York.
That whole Park Avenue crowd.
'So I fled to Paris to work on my book.'
And I was always going to this cafÃ©
in Montmartre with Jean-Jacques.
And Dickie would play
"My Funny Valentine".
It was only later that I found out
he only knows about six songs.
Anyway, I looked forward
to seeing him, I suppose.
(Speaks Italian)
(Speaking Italian)
Hey, hey, Signor Greenleaf!
If you're not at my place by 7.00,
Tom and I are running off together.
- Okay, fine.
- (Man) Oh, Dickie!

Oh, hold on. Hold on.
# Silvana, Silvana

You're breaking my ribs!
# But don't
# Change a hair for me

Oh! I could fuck this icebox,
I love it so much.
So, what did you actually do
in New York?
Played piano in a few places,
I told you.
Well, that's one job.
You told me a lot of jobs.
Few places. That's a few jobs.
The mysterious Mr Ripley.
Marge and I spent hours
speculating.
Anyway, I don't even want
to think about New York.
Are you ready?
- Cold beer. Thank you, Dad.
- Okay.
Copy out from here.
- You bring this with you to Europe?
- You gonna write something?
I love the fact that you brought
Shakespeare with you but no clothes.
Ermalinda says you wash out
the same shirt every night. Is that true?
No. I have more than one shirt.
She can do that for you.
Anyway, just wear some of my stuff.
Wear anything you want.
Most of it's ancient.
Now your signature.
Not Dickie. Your signature.
Without the glasses,
you're not even ugly.
I don't need them
because I never read.
- How do I look?
- Like Clark Kent.
- Now Superman.
- Superman.
- Okay.
- I know. It's like a kid's.
(Ripley) See this, the "S" and the "T"?
Fine, vulnerable.
That's pain. That's secret pain.
Well, that must be a very deep secret,
'cause I don't know about it.
(Ripley) There's nothing more
naked than your handwriting.
See how nothing's
quite touching the line?
- That's vanity.
- Well, we certainly know that's true.
(Dickie) Do you have any brothers?
(Ripley) No.
No brothers, no sisters.
Me neither.
Nor does Marge.
All only children.
What does that mean?
Means we've never shared a bath.
And I'm cold. Can I get in?
No.
I didn't mean with you in it.
(Dickie) Okay.
Get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
It is me. It's an old picture.
Every time!
"Is it you? It doesn't look like you."
God!
Letters.
Greenleaf and for Ripley.
Ooh, Fran. "I miss you.
When are you coming home?
"Stop telling me what
an incredible time you're having.
- "How much you love Dickie."
- Whoo!
"And Marge and Mongibello."
And this one, I think,
is from your father.
(Dickie vocalizing jazz)
- Let me see it. What does he say?
- He's getting impatient.
He wants me to reassure him you're
going to be home by Thanksgiving.
You've got to get a new jacket.
Really.
You must be sick
of wearing the same clothes.
I can't. I can't keep spending
your father's money.
I love how responsible you are.
My dad should make you
chief accountant or something.
Or when I take over,
which is never, I will.
Okay. When you take over,
which is never, I'll accept.
Let me buy you a jacket. When we get
to Rome, there's a great place...
- Battistoni.
- Battistoni.
(Sings in Italian)
# Roma, we're taking Tom to Roma
# We're going to a-Roma #
(Chatting in Italian)
Buon giorno. Nice sweater.
Where do we get a carrozza
for the Forum?
- Can we just hire any of them?
- Relax.
Relax!
It's just there's so much to do
in a single day.
Most important is where to eat.
I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Freddie?
Freddie. Freddie Miles.
Freddie's organising
the Cortina skiing trip.
Oh.
Oh, here he is.
(Tyres screech)
- Frederico!
- Come stai?
- Bene!
- Ciao, bello! Come stai?
Oh, God, don't you want to fuck
every woman you see just once?
- Only once?
- Absolutely. Once. Ciao.
- Tom Ripley, Freddie Miles.
- Tom.
I mean, hey, if I'm late,
think what her husband's saying.
- You look gorgeous.
- As always.
So... mangiare.
Si. I got us a table outside
at Fabrizio's. Tommy.
Outstanding. I tell you,
I'm so cabin-crazy with Mongi.
I know. I was there.
(# Jazz playing)
Look, Tom, we gotta go to a club
and meet some friends of Freddie's.
The best thing is, if you want
to be a tourist, grab a cab now,
and I'll meet you
at the railway station.
What club?
Freddie's arranged it
with some of the skiing crowd.
Come if you want, but I thought
you wanted to go sightseeing.
I do, and then maybe get
the jacket and what have you.
Dick! You gotta hear this!
Listen, just take one of mine
when we get back.
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Ciao. Have fun, okay?
(Knocking)
You said to make sure you didn't
miss the train. Leaves at 8.00.
(Snickers)
- Have a good time.
- See ya, Tommy.

- What are you doing?
Oh. I was just amusing myself.
- Sorry.
- I wish you'd get out of my clothes.
- Do you have my shoes on too?
- You said pick out a jacket, so...
Could you get undressed
in your own room?
- Thought you missed the train.
- Freddie drove me back in his car.
- Is Freddie here?
- He's downstairs.
I was just fooling around.
Don't say anything.
I was just fooling around.
Sorry.
(Freddie) God, a corduroy jacket in Italy.
- (Marge) Morning, Tom.
- Morning.
- (Chuckles)
- Come join us.
Hey. I want this job of yours, Tommy.
I was just saying, you live in Italy,
you stay at Dickie's house,
you eat Dickie's food,
you wear his clothes,
and his father picks up the tab.
(Chuckles)
If you get bored, you let me know,
'cause I'll do it.
- I'll do it.
- (Dickie) 'To the mainland!'
You really should go in.
It's marvellous.
I'm fine.
(Dickie and Freddie shouting)
Are you okay?
Sure.
The thing with Dickie...
It's like the sun shines on you,
and it's glorious.
And then he forgets you
and it's very, very cold.
So I'm learning.
When you have his attention, you feel
like you're the only person in the world.
That's why everybody loves him.
It's always the same. Whenever
someone new comes into his life...
Freddie, Fausto,
Peter Smith-Kingsley.
He's wonderful. Have you met him?
Especially you.
And that's just the boys.
Come and get him! Come and get him!
Tell me, why is it that when men play,
they always play at killing each other?
(Dickie) He's drowning me!
He's drowning me!
- I'm sorry about Cortina, by the way.
- What about Cortina?
Didn't... Didn't Dick say?
He spoke to Freddie and...
apparently it's not going to work out.
It's because everyone else can ski
and it affects where you stay and...
(Dickie) Come on, Freddie.
At least stick around
for the Festival of the Madonna.
- The whole town comes out...
- I don't think so.
I have my own Madonna back in Rome.
Why don't you come back with me?
A lot of ladies. Ooh!
(Sniggers)
- Oh, God.
- You want to take over?
Yeah, sure.
Just point her at Capri.
Avoid the rocks.
Where are you going?
Marge maintenance.
Aye-aye.
(Marge and Dickie murmuring)
(Marge) Don't.
(Scoffs)
(Marge) Dickie...
Tommy... how's the peeping?
Tommy, how's the peeping?
Tommy, Tommy,
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy...

(People applaud)
(Chanting continues)

- Is someone getting an ambulance?
- (Wailing)
(Crowd chant prayers)
(Shouting)
What's the fight about?
That's her fiancÃ©, isn't it?
I don't know.
Why are you asking me?
(Ripley) Are they blaming him?
How can it take an hour
to find an ambulance?
She was already dead, darling,
wasn't she? So I suppose...
I don't know why people say
this country is civilised.
- Dickie!
- It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
I'll go see what's the matter.
I'll go.
(# Solo saxophone)
(Tom) I know why you're upset.
I know about Silvana, Dickie.
I know about you and Silvana.
What about us?
You don't have to clean up!
Really!
- Like what?
- Forget it.
She was pregnant.
Did you know that?
Silvana was pregnant.
Do you know what that means
in a place like this?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
- What are you talking about?
- You've been so good to me.
You're the brother I never had.
I'm the brother you never had.
I would do anything for you, Dickie.
She came to me for help.
She needed money.
I didn't help her.
I didn't help her.
Now she's drowned herself,
and it's my fault.
I'm not going to say anything
to Marge, to the police or anybody.
It's a secret between us, Dickie.
And I'll keep it.
(Tom) "Dear Tom.
In view of the fact Dickie shows
"no more signs of coming home than
before you went..." Blah, blah, blah.
Erm..."I hope that the trip has
afforded you some pleasure,
"despite the failure
of its main objective.
"You no longer should consider
yourself obligated to us in any way."
Can't blame him.
You could hardly expect this
to go on forever, Tom.
Well, you can write again.
- Especially now we're brothers.
- I can't.
How can I, in all decency?
You said it yourself.
It's my dad's money you're spending.
We've had a great run though,
haven't we?
Well, we'll still go to Venice.
We could stick to that plan.
I don't think so, Tom.
You can't pay your own way, can you?
It's time we all moved on.
I'm sick of Mongi.
Especially now, with everything...
I really want to move to the north.
I need to check out
San Remo next week.
Find somewhere new
to keep the boat.
It would be great, though,
if you came with me to San Remo.
There's a great jazz festival.
We could say goodbye in style.
What do you think?
Our last trip!
Sure.
(Speaking Italian)
Why do you do
that thing with your neck?
What thing?
On trains,
you always do that thing.
Spooky.
Spook-k-k-k-k-k-ky.
(Mimics jazz percussion)
Spooky.
Oh! Didn't I tell you
San Remo was crazy?
This is more like it! Come on!
To Mongibello
and the happiest days of my life.
To Mongi.
You're cheerful tonight.
I'm suddenly quite happy
to be going back.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom?
I don't think I did, did I?
- Why are you asking all of a sudden?
- No reason.
Because you're leaving, I guess.
I don't think you were there.
- Why?
- I mean it as a compliment.
You've got such great taste.
Most of the thugs at Princeton had
tasted everything and had no taste.
I used to say, "The cream of America,
rich and thick."
Freddie's the perfect example.
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
I knew it! I knew it.
Marge and I had a bet.
Do you even like jazz,
or was that for my benefit?
- I've gotten to like it.
- Oh, yes!
I've gotten to like everything
about the way you live.
It's one big love affair.
If you knew my life
back home in New York...
I'm thinking of giving up the sax.
What do you think
about the drums?
- What?
- So cool.
I'm gonna rent a boat tomorrow,
take a look around.
This is how I found
my place in Mongi.
Took a boat out...
...around the bay,
first thing I liked, I got it.
- Whoa!
- Come on, Dickie. Don't go crazy.
- Dickie. Slow down!
- Ha-ha! Hold on!
Wait a minute!
It's gonna tip! Oh, God!
Stop it! Somebody!
Somebody! Stop it!
(Shouting)
Oh, I love it here!
I love it here!
I'm gonna move here!
Beautiful.
(Mimics jazz percussion)
- I want to tell you my plan.
- Oh, God!
So tell me.
Well, I thought I'd come back
in the new year under my own steam.
- Really? To Italy?
- Of course.
And I figured,
just for argument's sake,
say I got a place.
Or say we split the rent
on a house,
I could get a job, or, better still,
if I got a place in Rome,
and then when we're there,
we could be there, and when
we're here, we could be here.
- I don't think so.
- Particularly with the Marge problem.
You just blame me.
- Marge and I are getting married.
- How?
How?
Yesterday, you were ogling girls
on the terrace.
Today you're getting married?
That's absurd.
- I love Marge.
- You love me. You're not marrying me.
- Tom, I don't love you.
- No, I don't mean that as a threat.
To be honest,
I'm a little relieved you're going.
I think we've seen enough
of each other for a while.
- What?
- You can be a leech!
You know that!
And... it's boring.
You can be quite boring.
The funny thing is, I'm not pretending
to be somebody else, and you are.
Boring.
I've been absolutely honest with you
about my feelings.
Boring.
But you... First of all,
I know there's something.
That evening, when we played chess,
for instance, it was obvious.
- What evening?
- No, it's dangerous for you to take on.
Oh, no, no. We're brothers.
Hey. And then you do
this sordid thing with Marge,
fucking her on the boat,
while we all have to listen,
which was excruciating.
You follow your cock around like a...
And now you're getting married.
No, I'm bewildered. Forgive me.
You're lying to Marge and
then you're getting married to her.
You're knocking up Silvana.
You're ruining everybody...
You want to play the sax. You want
to play the drums. Which is it, Dickie?
What are you actually?
Who are you? Huh?
Some third-class mooch? Who are you?
Who are you to say anything to me?
Who are you to tell me anything?
Actually, I really, really do not want
to be on this boat with you.
- I can't move without you moving.
- Shut up.
It gives me the creeps.
You give me the creeps.
- You shut up.
- "Dickie, Dickie!" like a little girl.
Shut up!
Oh, God, Dickie.
- God's sake.
- Oh... Oh God!
Okay. Okay.
- We have to get you...
- (Screams)
I'm gonna kill you! Kill you!
(Screaming)
You're dead!
Stop! Stop! Please! Please!
- (Screaming)
- Stop it! Stop!
- Dickie, let go!
- I'll kill you!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
(Panting)
Can I have my key, please?
Of course.
You must be very cold.
Uh, Signor Greenleaf, yes?
No. I'm...
(Keyboard clacking)
- Hello, Marge.
- (Screams)
Tom!
You startled me.
- Sorry.
- You're back!
- How are you? Your book going well?
- Yes.
I'm on a good streak, thank you.
I was just... looking at you.
So quiet.
Where's Dickie?
I think he's planning on staying
in Rome for a few days.
Rome? Ahh.
Did he say why?
I don't understand Dickie.
Your guess is as good as mine.
What does that mean?
Oh, one day I'm invited skiing,
the next day I'm not.
One day, we're one family,
then the next day he wants to be alone.
You tell me.
Is that what he said?
He wants to be alone?
He was thinking of you.
He asked me to deliver this.
Thank you.
He knows I love this.
But why it couldn't have waited...
Errand number one:
Deliver Marge's perfume.
Errand number two:
Pack some clothes
and his precious saxophone.
How long is he staying for?
Search me.
I guess we're abandoned.
(Marge) Goddamn it!
(Tom) Are you okay?
There was a letter from Dickie
in with my perfume.
You realize it's more
than just a few days.
He's thinking of moving to Rome.
The thing is,
the night before he left, we...
we talked about moving together...
...somewhere north
and I suppose I...
...put some pressure on him
about getting married.
I just...
I just might have scared him off.
There's a side to him...
when our heads
are on the pillow...
I know no one else sees
that's so tender.
I think I should come
with you to Rome and confront him.
He hates being confronted.
I think you're right.
Grazie. Checking in.
Checking in.
- Signor Ripley?
- It's me.
Signor Greenleaf.
Of course. Welcome back.
Thank you.
- (Woman) 'Pronto?'
- I'd like to telephone the Hotel Goldoni.
- 'Si, signor.'
- I want to speak to Thomas Ripley.
- Ripley? Subito.
- Yes. Grazie.
(Phone buzzes)
- Pronto.
- 'Signor Ripley's not there.'
- He's not there?
- 'No, signor.'
Well, I would like
to leave a message.
I'll leave a message.
"Got your call.
Dinner tonight... sounds fine.
"Ripley."
- Dickie Greenleaf.
- (Woman) 'Dickie Greenleaf.'
- Yes. Greenleaf.
- 'Greenleaf.'
At the Grand.
(Tom) And I'd like to have
this wallet embossed.
I don't know the word in Italian.
Embossed.
Of course, Signor Greenleaf.
Thank you.
Dickie! It's...
- Oh, my gosh.
- Meredith.
- Ciao!
- Ciao. Come in. Come in.
But you're going skiing
with those Yankees, aren't you?
- What?
- At Christmas. To Cortina.
- With Freddie Miles.
- How did you know that?
Oh! Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Is Freddie in Rome?
- Now?
- Yeah.
Oh, I don't think so.
But I... But I've met him, of course,
and we've chatted.
And I know about you...
and Marge in Mongi.
What an unreliable rat you are.
Well, Freddie said
you were a rat.
And I thought to myself,
"Ah, now I know
why he travels under 'R."'
I've left Marge, Meredith.
And Mongi.
- So the rat's here in Rome.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, I've never been happier.
- I would not have made a joke.
I- I feel like
I've been handed a new life.
The truth is that
if you've had money your entire life,
either you despise it,
which we do... Agreed?
You're only truly comfortable
around other people...
who have it and despise it.
I know.
I've never admitted that to anyone.
(Chattering in Italian)
(Meredith) Because my friend
Mr Greenleaf, Signor Greenleaf and I,
- are on a little spending spree.
- (Man) I see.
We're behaving very badly.
Oh, I love Italian money. So dark.
Doesn't make you feel guilty.
- Gr-r-razie.
- Thank you.
I don't want too many large bills.
No one will change them.
Tutto bene,
Signor Greenleaf.
(Counting in Italian)
(Italian)
- I really like this too.
- I think I'm having that too.
(Italian)
- Tomorrow.
- (Italian)
- Arrivederci.
- Arrivederci. Oops!
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
I know you're a jazz fiend,
but do you absolutely hate the opera?
I've... I've...
been trying to give
my tickets away.
It's tomorrow. But if you
were prepared to be dragged...
You could drag me.

for inviting me tonight.
Can you bear it?
We hear you are a friend of Freddie's.
He has "I hate opera"
tattooed on his chest.
There's room for a whole libretto
on Freddie's chest.
I'm sure we've met before.
I was sure we'd met before.
Weren't you, Ted?
Dick is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
- I know.
- Yes, I think we have.
One minute you people are children,
and the next you're getting tattooed.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
- Excuse me.
- Prego.
Oh! Excuse me.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Tom!
- Marge!
How are you?
What are you doing in Rome?
- Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
- No. Um, no.
Um, hello.
Um, I'm Tom Ripley.
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard
all about you from Marge and Dickie.
- Ditto.
- No-no glasses.
So, where are you hiding him?
He's impossible, isn't he?
Is he really not here?
Marge, you know Dickie has
"I hate opera" tattooed on his chest.
- I thought you were going to Venice.
- Yes, what happened with that?
I heard you were desperate
to come.
I was rather looking forward
to rowing you around.
- (Bell ringing)
- I am. I really am.
I've been travelling, and I just
can't seem to get that far north.
Well, you should hurry,
before we sink.
Look, let me give you
the telephone number.
There. Oh, look.
There's Meredith.
Meredith. What's her name, Marge?
The textile people.
Erm, come on. Some of us spent
Christmas at her house.
I don't know her.
He hasn't called.
He's hardly written.
Just these cryptic notes,
you know?
- You don't just dump people.
- (Bell rings)
Look, will we see you later,
or are you with people?
- Uh, I can't later.
- Well, how about tomorrow?
Yes, uh,
maybe in the morning?
Do you know Cafe Dinelli
at the Piazza di Spagna?
- I know the Piazza di Spagna. Time?
- 10:30?
- We'll be there.
- Okay.
So I'll see you
in the morning, Marge?
10:30?
Very nice to meet you.
(Peter) And you.
Come on.
Come on. Let's go back in.
I don't understand
why Tom's still in Rome.
- Let's go.
- I thought you were enjoying yourself.
Let's take a carrozza
and look at the moon.
Are you crazy?
It's freezing out there.
Come on. I need to talk to you.
Just the two of us.
(Meredith) Okay.
(Meredith)
Don't worry, please.
Don't worry.
You're such a pal to understand. I...
It's like Marge is here right now.
I look at you,
and I see her face.
And I can't... No matter what
I'm feeling towards you...
No. I absolutely... understand.
Otherwise, you'd be fighting me off.
Beating you away.
Look, will you meet me
tomorrow?
Just to say goodbye properly,
you know, in the daylight,
so it's not just this.
Of course. Meredith, I'm sorry.
Of course I'll meet you.
You should always
save pain for daylight.
Why don't we have coffee
in the morning at Dinelli's?
Uh, by the Spanish Steps.
Exactly. 10:30?
- 10:15.
- Okay.
Okay.

(Tolling continues)

(Chattering, Indistinct)
- (Peter) Grazie.
- Peter?
Hello. Its Meredith Logue.
(Peter) Of course it is.
Meredith, hello. Sorry.
- I was half asleep. How are you?
- How are you?
This is Marge Sherwood.
Meredith Logue.
How do you do?
Do join us, won't you?
We're just waiting for a friend.
I-I won't, actually.
I think there's...
- It was you at the opera last night?
- Uh...
Are you waiting for Dickie?
Dickie? Do you- Do you-
Do you know Dickie?
You were at the opera.
Oh, that explains- Yes, I was there.
I was there with Dickie.
(Exhales) I knew it.
I told you.
Marge, I don't know you,
so I've got no right to...
Dickie loves you.
He's- Well-
I think you'll find
he's on his way home to you.
(Sighs) Well, how-how-how
would you know that?
He... told me everything.
No, I was supposed to meet him
15 minutes ago, so, uh,
I'm gonna go now, I think.
God, unless he meant us to meet.
That'd be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
Ah no, we're meeting another friend.
- Tom Ripley.
- Do you know Tom Ripley?
No, no. I've heard about him, of course,
but I didn't meet him, no.
- (Italian)
- Not for me. No, grazie.
Hope I didn't complicate matters.
God, nothing, nothing...
untoward happened.
No, there is nothing to prevent you
from welcoming him back,
from marrying him.
Goodbye. I'm happy to put
a face to a name.
Goodbye, Peter.
Please, don't get up.
(Marge) Now I don't know what to
think. Do you think he's coming back?
Sorry- Sorry.
Had to renew my papers.
Never one stamp when they can
make you line up for three.
- Have you been waiting long?
- Not at all.
- Morning, Tom.
- Hi. Sorry.
You okay? You look like
you've seen a ghost
Dickie was at the opera
last night.
I don't believe that.
Uh- Wild horses couldn't drag Dickie-
(Laughs) Well, he was there
with someone, you know,
so I suppose she must
have dragged him.
It's not fair.
I think I'm going back to Mongi.
I think Dickie's coming home.
Really? I- Well,
that's just swell.
No, you know,
you're way ahead of me. Great.
That was rather moving
when I heard... I'm sorry.
Meredith is the American girl
I saw at the opera last night.
- She's been seeing something of Dickie.
- Oh, my God.
But the point is,
Dickie- and we all know this
Dickie loves Marge.
And he misses her.
I feel guilty.
Marge doesn't understand this,
but whenever Dickie does
something, I feel guilty.
(Chuckles)
As if that makes sense.

Hello, Freddie.
It's Tom.
Um, where's Dickie?
How are you?
I'm good. Uh, yes, thank you.
He's gone. He went to dinner.
- He's at Otello's. You know Otello's?
- No, no, no.
I don't think he's at dinner
at 6:30pm.
If you said he was still at lunch,
maybe I'd believe you.
You know? Incredible.
I mean, the guy just, you know,
disappeared off the face of the earth.
I guess.
The landlady,
as far as I could tell-
The landlady said
he was here right now.
Search the place.
I just don't know why you'd imagine
that Dickie would hide from you.
Because he's been
hiding from me.
- What happened at Christmas?
- What about Christmas?
He was supposed to come skiing.
I didn't get a cable...
or a call or a little note or a-
- (Grunts)
- Frankly, a fart.
Well, he's been very involved
with his music.
Um, I think his theory... is...
that you have to go into a cocoon,
uh, before you can be a butterfly.
Which is horse shit.
You hear him play this thing?
Well, he can't.
How did you find him?
It's such an out-of-the-way apartment.
Can I fix you a drink?
No, thanks.
At the American Express.
(Strikes random keys)
Some kid.
(Strikes keys)
Are you living here?
No, no. I'm staying here
for a few days.
- But-
- (Strikes keys)
It's a new piano.
Probably shouldn't...
(Striking keys)
- Probably shouldn't-
- (Strikes keys)
Did this place come furnished?
It doesn't look like Dickie's, uh-
It's really horrible, isn't it?
It's so, uh, bourgeois.
Oh, that's a, uh-
You should- Watch that.
Excuse- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
In fact, the only thing
that looks like Dickie... is you.
- Hardly.
- Hmm.
Have you done something
to your hair?
Is there something
you'd like to say, Freddie?
- What?
- Something you'd like to say?
I think I'm saying it.
Something's going on.
Either he's converted to Christianity,
or there's something else.
Well, I would suggest you
ask Dickie that yourself.
Otello's is on della Croce
just off the Corso.
Is it on della Croce
just off the Corso?
Sure. You're a quick study,
aren't you?
Last time you didn't know
you ass from your elbow,
and now you're giving me directions.
That's not fair. You probably do know
your ass from your elbow.
I'll see you.

No Dickie Greenleaf. Thomas Ripley.

No. You're just so drunk.
Oh. You're just...
What can you do, eh?
You should see my other friends.
- What can you do?
- (Italian)
Yes. Such a pig.

(Mimics Freddie) Hey, if I'm drunk,
think what her husband's saying.
- La polizia.
- Dickie Greenleaf?
- Yes.
- Inspector Roverini.
- Can we come in?
- Please.
It's a terrible shock, huh?
W-What time did Signor Miles
leave yesterday?
Um, I can't be certain
exactly. I-
8:00, 9:00.
(Italian)
We'd both taken on, uh,
far too many drinks.
But it was dark. It was certainly dark
when I- when I walked him to his car.
So he drove away,
and, uh, you did what?
- I went to bed.
- (Italian)
Freddie's a big man, but I'm
in trouble after a couple of drinks.
I've been suffering all-
Who found him?
(Italian)
You understand, I must ask you...
to stay in Rome,
Signor Greenleaf.
Yes, if it's gonna help, certainly.
So, the doctor,
he has to make the, um-
(Italian)
- Postmortem.
- Yeah, exactly.
But, you know,
his first conclusion...
was that Signor Miles was killed
not later than 7:00 yesterday evening.
Well, he certainly wasn't dead
when he drove away in his car.
No.
(Chattering)
(Italian)
(Italian) It's okay.
- Okay?
- Si, si.
- Did he kill Freddie?
- Marge.
- When did you get here?
- Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I'd swear he didn't.
Of course he didn't.
I tried again.
Waiting here, watching for him.
Instead, it's you.
Whenever I look for Dickie, I find you.
What happened to your face?
Dickie- Dickie did it.
- Dickie?
- My face. There was an argument.
I- I said some things
I shouldn't have said and I-
About you. About the appalling way
he's treating you, all of us.
And the next thing I know,
he's launched himself at me.
- Are you getting on?
- What?
Get on.
I'll take you to him.
(Italian)
(Engine stops)
- Where does he live?
- We passed it a few blocks back.
It's where the police were.
The Palazzo Gioia.
They don't even know I'm in Rome,
and I'm not gonna incriminate Dickie.
Well, perhaps
I shouldn't go either.
No. Go if you want to, but just
don't talk to the police about my face.
If they know he hit me and his temper,
then he could've hit Freddie.
I'll catch up with you later.
(Engine starts)
(Italian)
Signor Greenleaf!
It's Signor Greenleaf!
Presto, presto!
(Shouting in Italian)
Open the door!
Open up!
- (Italian)
- I live here!
Mr Greenleaf!
Can we go up?
Do you mind?
Of course.
What happened to your face?
My scooter. I fell off
getting chased by photographers.
The telephone, the press,
I've been... I'm feeling hounded.
Do you think you could
not give out my address?
Never. We've had many requests and, of
course, we say no, even to your fiancÃ©e.
I really don't want
to see anybody.
- Even your fiancÃ©e?
- Even her.
(Man speaking Italian)
- (Roverini) What about Thomas Ripley?
- What about Tom Ripley?
You and Signor Ripley went
to San Remo. Is that right?
Yes, we- We went to San Remo.
That was months ago.
November, I thought.
Was it?
- Did you speak to Tom?
- November 7 is my information.
I don't remember
the exact date.
- When did you last see Signor Ripley?
- A few days ago.
- Does he stay with you here?
- No.
No.
Here is a pattern.
Two days ago,
Freddie Miles is dead, hmm?
He leaves your apartment
and he's murdered.
Yesterday, a little boat is found
in San Remo full of rocks.
And the owner tells the police
it was stolen on November 7.
We look at hotel records...
and we see...
Dickie Greenleaf
is staying in San Remo.
And then our boatman remembers
two Americans taking a boat.
That is not a pattern.
That's a coincidence.
There must be 50 hotels
in San Remo.
There were probably a hundred people
renting a boat that day.
Thirty-one people.
Thirty-one, yeah.
(Italian)
- Marge Sherwood.
- That is Miss Sherwood now.
Let her in.
Let her in. What's the difference?
Let her in.
No! Actually-
Actually, no.
I would- I would
really appreciate it...
if you would ask Miss Sherwood
to come back later.
(Italian)
Thank you.
May I ask you-
Why would you speak to your friend
and not your fiancÃ©e?
Well, I-
I think I just said.
Um, Mr Ripley was
handling some business for me.
Nor does Mr Ripley
want to marry me...
and ask me every single day
if I'll marry him...
and when.
Do you keep a photograph
of Signor Ripley?
I'm not in the habit of carrying
around photographs of my male friends.
Now I think I've upset you.
Sorry. My English, perhaps,
is coarse.
It is a little coarse, yes.
I'm sorry.
But you- No one has seen
Signor Ripley since San Remo.
- I have.
- You have, yes.
And so has Miss Sherwood.
Ask her. And, um,
if I can remember the name
of the hotel he was staying at...
Um, the Goldoni.
Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Goldoni. The Goldoni.
Good, good, but...
Yes, you are right.
You are right.
A coincidence.
(Siren wailing)
(Sighing)
I look forward to our next meeting.
Hmm? When I will be
more careful with my English.
(Roverini) Ah. I have a witness
who thinks they saw two men...
getting into Mr Miles' car.
And she wants to identify you
in a confronto.
Line-up. Tomorrow, then?
Uh, tomorrow.
(Chuckles)
- Buon giorno, Miss Sherwood.
- Buon giorno.
He's in, but I really don't think
he wants to meet anybody.
(Knocking)
Dick?
Dickie?
I know you can hear me.
(Sighing)
I was gonna say that I would count to
three, and if you didn't open the door...
But I won't count any more.
On you.
I won't count on you any more.
Whatever it is you've done
or haven't done,
you've broken my heart.
That's one thing
I know you're guilty of.
And I don't know why.

made it to Venice.
I'm delighted, contrary to rumour,
that you're still in one piece.
- What rumour?
- Oh, you know.
That Dickie murdered you
and is travelling under your passport.
I know. It's ridiculous.

for someone from Rome.
What do you mean?
They've sent for someone from Rome?
- Well, yes. That's good, isn't it?
- No, I thought...
that didn't happen in Italy,
that each region is separate.
I was sure that-
I've read that-
You've read the papers.
You know what a big deal it's been.
- American tourist murdered.
- Actually, can we not do this now?
- The stench really is-
- (Man speaking Italian)
(Italian)
(Continues in Italian)
He's taken over the case, because
they're annoyed that the previous chap...
let Dickie disappear
when he was, um,
the only suspect
in Freddie's murder.
(Italian)
In Rome,
about three weeks ago.
I knew that one.
Um-
(Italian)
(Italian)
Are you a homosexual?
Interesting non sequitur.
No.
- No.
- Oh.
By the way, um, officially
there are no Italian homosexuals.
Makes Michelangelo and
Leonardo very inconvenient.
Eh?
Tell him...
I have a fiancÃ©e.
And Dickie has a fiancÃ©e.
And that Freddie Miles
probably had a string of them.
(Italian)
Mamma mia.
(Italian)
- (Inspector laughing)
- (Chuckling)
- What did he say?
- He says "so many fiancÃ©es."
(Italian)
He's asking...
if you killed Freddie Miles...
- and then killed Dickie Greenleaf.
- No!
No, I did not kill Freddie Miles
and then kill Dickie Greenleaf.
Is he accusing me?
Ask him if he's accusing me.
- Here, it's better to be less volatile.
- But it's absurd.
(Italian)
They found this
in Dickie's place in Rome.
- You opened this?
- Of course.
It's a suicide note.
You asked me all these questions
and you already read this suicide note?
I don't believe that letter.
Do you?
Dickie's letter.
Do you believe it?
I don't know what to believe.
Can you imagine, though, if he did
kill Freddie, what that must be like?
Just to wake up every morning.
I mean, how can you?
Just wake up and be a person?
Drink your coffee.
Well, whatever you do,
however terrible, however hurtful,
it all makes sense,
doesn't it, in your head.
You never meet anybody
who thinks they're a bad person.
No, I know, but you're still tormented.
You must be. You've killed someone.
Don't you just take the past
and put it in a room in the basement,
and lock the door
and never go in there?
- That's what I do.
- God, yes.
But, of course, in my case,
it's probably a whole building.
And then you meet someone special,
and all you want to do
is toss them the key.
Say "Open up. Step inside."
But you can't...
- (Resumes playing)
- Because it's dark...
and there are demons.
And if anybody saw
how ugly it is-
Now that's the music talking.
It's harder to be bleak if you're
playing "Knees Up, Mother Brown."
I keep wanting to do that.
Fling... the door open.
(Resumes playing)
Just let the light in,
clean everything out.
If I could take a giant eraser
and rub out everything,
starting with myself-
The thing is, Peter, if-
- Hmm?
- If...
If...
No key, huh?
(# Boy singing in Latin)
- Marge.
- Peter.
- So good to see you.
- Hello, Marge.
Tom.
- I see you found Peter.
- I think we sort of found each other.
- Where's Dickie's father?
- He's not coming till the morning.
Evidently his stomach. I don't think
the food here is agreeing with him.
Oh, I was looking forward
to seeing him.
Dickie hasn't killed himself.
I'm sure of that.
There's a private detective
on the case now.
A Mr MacCarron
Dickie's father's employed.
- That's a terrific idea.
- He's American.
He's already discovered that
Dickie cashed cheques for $1,000...
the day before he disappeared.
(Man) Signora.
Is that what you do
before you jump into the Tiber?
I don't think so.
- Is this you?
- No, it's Tom's.
Splendid, eh?
Golly. Who's paying for this?
Peter found it for me.
I can afford it because
it's damp and... falling down.
- Tom's transformed it.
- This is spectacular.
That's why
Tom wanted you to stay.
It's better than trying
to squeeze into my room.
And I know
how you hate hotels.
A hotel would have been fine.
We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf
how far his dollar stretched.
What's funny?
I was just thinking about
when Tom first came to Mongibello.
- And look at you now?
- Look at me what?
To the manor born.
(Bell tolling)
(Tom) Mr Greenleaf?
Mr Greenleaf?
Tom. How are you?
You look well.
- Thank you, sir. I am well.
- Far cry from New York.
- Yes, it is.
- Marge.
Good morning.
Unusual weather.
- Very.
- And you, sir. Any better?
Pretty good.
Sticking with hot water.
- Where's Mr MacCarron?
- San Remo.
The police are amateurs.
Well, my boy, it's come
to a pretty pass, hasn't it?
What is the detective hoping
to find in San Remo?
He's being thorough.
I'm learning about my son, Tom.
Now he's missing,
I'm learning a great deal about him,
and I hope that you can fill in
some more blanks for me.
Marge has been good enough
to do that about Mongibello.
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously,
I'll do anything to help Dickie.
Good. This theory,
the letter he left for you.
The police think that's a clear indication
he was planning on doing something,
uh, to himself.
I just don't believe that.
You don't want to, dear.
I'd like to talk to Tom alone.
Perhaps this afternoon.
Would you mind?
Marge, what a man may say
to his sweetheart...
and what he'll admit
to another fellow-
Such as?
(Clears throat) What a waste
of lives... and opportunities.
I'd pay that fellow a hundred dollars
right now to shut up!
No, Marge doesn't know
the half of it.
And his passport photo.
Did you hear? To scratch out
his own face like that?
Can you imagine?
Frame of mind
you'd have to be in?
"I've thought about going to the police,
but I can't face it.
"I can't face anything any more."
I feel guilty.
I feel like I pushed him away.
I feel like I spoke
and he heard you.
Well... (Clears throat)
If we all pushed him away,
what about him pushing us away?
You've been a great friend
to my son.
Everything is someone else's fault.
We all want to sow wild oats,
but somebody's got to-
got to-
What is the word?
You know,
the moment someone confronts him,
he lashes out.
He always has.
You know, people always say that
you can't choose your parents,
but you can't choose
your children.
- (Knocking)
- (Freddie's voice) 'Dickie.'
(Dickie's voice) 'You can be
a leech. You can be quite boring.'
(Tom) 'Stop it!'
(Dickie) 'Boring, it's boring.'
- (Knocking)
- (Voices overlapping)
(Tom screams)
' Stop, stop, stop!
- 'Stop, stop, stop!'
- (Freddie) 'Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.'
(Dickie) 'Like a little girl.'
- 'Like a little girl.'
- (Knocking)
(Knocking)
- (Knocking)
- Coming.
- Sorry. I was asleep.
- Finally.
- I must have fallen asleep.
- Did Dickie's dad go?
You look ghastly, Tom.
Did you have a nightmare?
- He's having an early night.
- Oh, poor man.
You know, we were banging
on that door forever.
(Marge) Uh-oh.
- I think I've broken a strap.
- Not guilty.
- I'll fix some drinks.
- (Marge giggling)
Ah! You walk in Venice.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
- Did you want me to stick around?
- No, it's okay.
I could come back.
Your key.
- (Knocking)
- (Marge) Tom?
Marge, I'm in the bath.
I won't be long.
Tom, I have to speak to you.
It's urgent.
Coming.
- I found Dickie's rings.
- What?
You have Dickie's rings.
I can explain.
Dickie promised me
he would never take off this ring.
- Let me put some clothes on...
- I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
- I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
- Marge, you're being hysterical.
He promised me, "I swear, I will
never take off this ring until we get..."
- Shut up!
- (Gasping)
I'm wet, Marge.
I've lost my towel.
And I'd really like
to put some clothes on.
Go and pour us both a drink.
Pour us a drink.
Marge?
Where are you going?
I wasn't snooping.
I just...
I was looking for a needle
and thread to mend my bra.
That scent you're wearing.
I bought that for you.
The thing about Dickie-
So many things.
That day when he was late
coming back from Rome,
I tried to tell you this.
He was with another girl.
I'm not talking about Meredith, either.
Another girl
that we met in a bar.
He couldn't be faithful
for five minutes.
So when he makes a promise,
it doesn't mean what it means
when you make a promise...
or I make a promise.
He has so many realities, Dickie,
and he believes them all.
He lies. He lies.
And that's his- Half the time
he doesn't even realize he's doing it.
And today,
I really started wondering
whether he may have killed Freddie.
He would get so crazy
if anybody would contradict him.
Well, you know that.
You know that.
You know that.
And that's the irony, Marge.
I loved you.
You may as well know, Marge.
I loved you.
I don't know, maybe it's grotesque
of me to say this now,
so just... write it on a piece
of paper or something...
and put it in your purse
for a rainy day.
"Tom loves me. Tom loves me."
- Why do you have Dickie's rings?
- I told you.
- He gave them to me.
- Why? When?
I feel as if you haven't been listening
to anything I've been saying to you.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
- It's all true.
- I don't believe...
a single word you've said.
You're shivering, Marge.
Look at you.
Marge, can I hold you?
Will you let me hold you?
- (Screaming)
- Marge?
- Oh, Peter. Thank God you're here.
- What's going on?
Get me out of here.
Get me out of here. Please!
- (Peter) Tom, are you okay?
- (Marge sobbing)
You try.
You try talking to her.
- (Peter) Tom?
- I give up.
Tell me what's going on. Tom!
- (Tom) What did I ever do to her?
- Listen-
Have her tell you one thing
that I've ever done to her.
You can't be angry with her.
She's confused,
and she needs someone to blame.
So she blames you.
I'll go back home
and talk to her.
As for you,
either get a safety razor
or grow a beard.
(Knocking)
- Is Mr Greenleaf here?
- Mr Ripley?
- Yes.
- I'm Alvin MacCarron.
(Marge) I don't know,
I don't know. I just know it.
(Mr Greenleaf) Marge, there's female
intuition and then there are facts.
- Tom.
- Sir.
Marge, you should have waited.
I didn't...
Didn't Peter say I'd come by
and pick you up?
Marge has been telling us
about the rings.
Yes, I feel ridiculous
I didn't mention them yesterday.
I clean forgot. Ridiculous.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because
there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
I'm going to take Marge
for a little walk, Tom.
Mr MacCarron needs to talk to you.
- We could go to the bar...
- No, no.
I think you should stay here.
(Door closing)
I could probably see
my room from here.
I can see my house.
When you see where you live from
a distance, it's like a dream, isn't it?
I don't care for BS.
I don't care to hear it.
I don't care to speak it.
- Okay.
- Did you know that at Princeton...
Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
At a party over some girl.
Kicked the kid several times
in the head, put him in the hospital.
Boy had a wire fixed in his jaw,
lost some hearing.
Why do you think Dickie's father
sent him to Europe in the first place?
The Rome police didn't think
to ask Mr Greenleaf.
Nor did they think to check
on whether a Thomas Ripley...
had ever been a student
at Princeton University.
Oh, I turned up a Tom Ripley...
who had been a piano tuner
in the music department.
You see, in America,
we are taught to check a fact
before it becomes a fact.
We're taught to nose around.
When a girl drowns herself,
find out if that girl is pregnant.
Find out if Dickie had
an embarrassment there.
Mr Greenleaf appreciates
your loyalty. He really does.
Marge...
She has a hundred theories.
There are a few things
that she doesn't know.
We hope she never knows.
I hope she never knows.
Three different people...
saw Dickie get into Freddie's car.
One man,
who will not testify...
because he was jumping
somebody else's wife at the time,
saw Dickie removing licence plates
from a red sports car.
The police know about this man
because he happens to be a policeman.
I found these in the basement
of Dickie's apartment.
They belong to Freddie's car.
Mr Greenleaf has asked me...
to lose these in the canal
this evening.
(Bell tolling)
Mr Greenleaf feels that
there was a silent promise...
in Dickie's letter to you
which he intends to honour.
He also intends to transfer a portion
of Dickie's income from his trust...
into your name.
He does not intend...
to give the Italians
any information about Dickie's past.
He's rather hoping that...
you will feel the same.
- Thank you so much, Tom.
- Sir.
Goodbye.
Marge, I feel I never should have said
those things to you the other evening.
I was pretty flustered, and the rings-
And you looked so-
I don't know.
But I hope that note goes
in your purse to New York...
for a rainy day.
- What are you gonna do now, Tom?
- I don't know.
Peter has a concert in Athens
next month,
so he asked me
to come along and help out.
He says goodbye.
By the way, he was in rehearsal
so he couldn't-
Why do I think there's
never been a Ripley rainy day?
What?
I know it was you.
I know it was you.
- I know it was you! I know it was you!
- Marge!
- Marge, Marge. Please!
- I know you killed Dickie!
- Marge!
- I know! No!
(Sobbing)
I know it was you!
Marge. Marge, please.
It's not Tom. Really.
(Tom and Peter)
# We are called gondoleri
# But that's a vagary
It's quite honorary
# The trade that we ply #
Ask me what I want to change
about this moment.
I don't know. What do you want
to change about this moment?
Nothing.
(Peter)
I'm freezing. Coming down?
Later. I want to catch the sunset.
- You're mad. (Chuckling)
- I am.
(Meredith) Dickie?
Dickie?
Dickie!
(Italian)
Oh, my God.
Hello, Meredith.
I was looking at you.
Your clothes.
I wouldn't have known you.
Well, you spotted me,
so you get the reward.
- What?
- Just kidding.
- Are you alone?
- Oh.
Hardly.
Couldn't be less alone.
- Aunt Joan.
- And "co."
A lot of "co."
Oh, God.
You know, seeing you again, I...
I've thought about you...
so much.
And I've thought about you.
Yeah, well, when I've thought
about you, I was mostly hating you.
Where have you been hiding?
I haven't been hiding.
I've been in police custody.
They've been trying
to flush out Freddie's killer.
- You're kidding.
- Well, they're giving me this vacation,
which is why the get-up.
Which is why
you haven't heard from me.
You know, the whole world
thinks you killed Freddie.
- Oh! It's terrible.
- I know.
Listen, I can't talk now.
Um, later?
Later? Later?
So...
(Laughs)
Are you travelling under "R"?
(Laughs)
You know what? I am.
(Laughing)
Dickie, are you with
Peter Smith-Kingsley? I bet you are.
My aunt thought she saw him.
Peter Smith-Kingsley?
No, I...
I haven't seen him in months.
No, I'm alone.
(Knocking at door)
Hi.
- How was it?
- It was good.
But I'll tell you something.
I want us to stay in here
for the rest of the trip.
(Chuckles)
Was that Meredith?
Was who Meredith?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing
someone. It looked like Meredith.
I came out to find you.
Oh, hardly kissing.
- Kissing off.
- It didn't look that way.
You know? From a distance?
I lied... to her.
She thought she'd seen you.
Why lie?
Dickie and Peter together.
That's just too good gossip.
Or Tom and Peter, even.
That would be
even better gossip.
Really? Why?
(Sighing)
I, um- (Sighing)
I'm completely lost.
I know.
I'm sorry, Peter.
I'm lost.
I'm gonna be stuck
in the basement, aren't I?
Aren't I?
That's my-
Terrible...
and alone...
and dark.
(Chuckles)
And I've lied...
about who I am...
and where I am.
Now no one'll ever find me.
(Chuckling)
What do you mean,
lied about who you are?
I always thought
it'd be better...
to be a fake somebody...
than a real nobody.
What are you talking about?
You're not a nobody.
That's the last thing you are.
Peter. (Sighing)
Tell me some good things
about Tom Ripley.
No, don't get up.
Don't get up. Don't get up.
Just-
Just tell me some nice things...
about Tom Ripley.
(Chuckling)
"Good things about Tom Ripley."
That could take me some time.
Tom is talented.
Tom is tender.
Tom is beautiful.
(Crying and chuckling)
You're such a liar.
Tom is-
Tom is a mystery.
(Peter) 'Tom is not a nobody.
'Tom has secrets
he doesn't want to tell me,
'and I wish he would.
'Tom has nightmares.
'That's not a good thing.
'Tom has someone to love him.
'That is a good thing.
'Mmm. (Chuckling)
Tom is crushing me.
(Whispering) 'Tom is crushing me.'
- (Tom sobbing)
- 'Tom. Tom, you're crush-'
- (Peter gagging)
- (Tom sobs) 'Oh, God!
'Oh, God!'
- (Gagging continues)
- 'Oh, God!'
(Sobbing continues)
'Oh, God! Peter.'

WOMAN: Remember, remember
The 5th of November
The gunpowder treason and plot
I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason
Should ever be forgot
But what of the man?
I know his name was Guy Fawkes
and I know in 1605, he attempted
to blow up the Houses of Parliament.
But who was he really?
What was he like?
[DOGS BARKING]
WOMAN: We are told to remember
the idea and not the man.
Because a man can fail.
He can be caught,
he can be killed and forgotten.
But 400 years later
an idea can still change the world.
I have witnessed firsthand
the power of ideas.
I've seen people kill
in the name of them...
[CROWD YELLING]
...and die defending them.
But you cannot kiss an idea
cannot touch it or hold it.
Ideas do not bleed.
They do not feel pain.
They do not love.
And it is not an idea that I miss.
It is a man.
A man that made me remember
the 5th of November.
A man that I will never forget.
So I read that the former United States
is so desperate for medical supplies
that they have allegedly sent several
containers filled with wheat and tobacco.
A gesture, they said, of goodwill.
You wanna know what I think?
Well, you're listening to my show,
so I will assume you do.
It's high time we let the colonies know
what we really think of them.
I think it's payback time for a tea party
they threw for us a few hundred years ago.
I say we go down to those docks tonight
and dump that crap
where everything from the Ulcered Sphincter
of Ass-erica belongs!
Who's with me? Who's bloody with me?
[TV AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
Did you like that?
USA, Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica.
I mean, what else can you say?
Here was a country that had everything,
absolutely everything,
and now, 20 years later, is what?
The world's biggest leper colony. Why?
Godlessness.
Let me say that again.
Godlessness.
It wasn't the war they started.
It wasn't the plague they created.
It was Judgment.
No one escapes their past.
No one escapes Judgment.
You think he's not up there?
You think he's not watching over
this country?
How else can you explain it?
He tested us, but we came through.
We did what we had to do.
Islington. Enfield.
I was there. I saw it all.
Immigrants, Muslims,
homosexuals, terrorists.
Disease-ridden degenerates.
They had to go.
Strength through unity.
Unity through faith.
I am a God-fearing Englishman,
and I'm goddamn proud of it!
That's quite enough of that,
thank you very much.
Oh, shit.
WOMAN:

A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.
Any unauthorized personnel

This is for your protection.
A yellow-coded curfew
is now in effect.
Any unauthorized personnel

This is for your protection.
- Whoa! Excuse me.
- Sorry, I didn't see you...
- In a hurry, are we?
- I was just...
- It's past curfew, you know.
- My uncle, he's very sick.
- Sick uncle? What you think, Willy?
- It's a load of bollocks.
I made a mistake. I shouldn't be out
after curfew. I know that.
Maybe you could look after us
before getting back to your uncle.
MAN: See, my friend, he's kind of sick.
Ain't you?
Real sick. Bad case of the blues.
You can feel them.
- Don't touch me!
- Look, Willy, kitty's got claws.
- She just threatened us.
- That she did, that she did.
You know what that means,
don't you?
It means that we exercise
our own judicial discretion.
And you get to swallow it.
- Oh, God, you're Fingermen.
- She's getting the picture.
No, please, I didn't know. I'm sorry.
Not yet you're not. But you will be.
By sunup, if you're not the sorriest
piece of ass in all of London...
then you'll certainly be the sorest.
Oh, God, no. Please don't do this.
I'll go home.
I won't do it again, I swear! Please!
- What do you think, lads?
- Spare the rod, spoil the child.
Help me! Someone help!
V: The multiplying villainies of nature
do swarm upon him.
- FINGERMAN: What the hell?
- WILLY: Bugger off!
Disdaining fortune,
with his brandish'd steel
which smoked with bloody execution.
FINGERMAN:
We're Fingermen, pal.
V: Aha!
[YELLS]
[WHIMPERING]
Jesus Christ! Mercy!
We are oft to blame in this...
'Tis too much proved.
...that with devotion's visage
and pious action
we do sugar o'er the devil himself.
- What's that mean?
- Spare the rod.
[TRUNCHEON DROPS]
I can assure you, I mean you no harm.
- Who are you?
- Who?
Who is but the form
following the function of what
and what I am is a man in a mask.
- Oh, I can see that.
- Of course you can.
I'm not questioning your powers
of observation.
I'm merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is.
- Oh. Right.
- But on this most auspicious of nights
permit me then, in lieu of
the more commonplace sobriquet
to suggest the character
of this dramatis persona.
VoilÃ !
In view, a humble
vaudevillian veteran
cast vicariously as both victim
and villain by the vicissitudes of fate.
This visage,
no mere veneer of vanity
is a vestige of the vox populi,
now vacant, vanished.
However, this valorous visitation
of a bygone vexation stands vivified
and has vowed to vanquish these venal
and virulent vermin vanguarding vice
and vouchsafing the violently vicious
and voracious violation of volition.
The only verdict is vengeance,
a vendetta
held as a votive not in vain,
for the value and veracity of such
shall one day vindicate the vigilant
and the virtuous.
[V CHUCKLES]
Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose.
So let me simply add that it's
my very good honor to meet you
and you may call me V.
Are you, like, a crazy person?
I am quite sure they will say so.
But to whom, might I ask,
am I speaking?
- I'm Evey.
- Evey?
E-vey. Of course you are.
- What does that mean?
- It means that I, like God,
do not play with dice
and do not believe in coincidence.
Are you hurt?
No, I'm fine.
- Thanks to you.
- Oh, I merely played my part.
- But tell me, do you enjoy music, Evey?
- I suppose.
You see, I'm a musician of sorts
and on my way to give
a very special performance.
What kind of musician?
Percussion instruments are my speciality.
But tonight I intend to call upon
the entire orchestra for this event
and would be honored
if you could join me.
I don't think so.
I should be getting home.
I promise you, it'll be like
nothing you've ever seen.
And afterwards,
you'll return home safely.
All right.
EVEY: It's beautiful up here.
V: A more perfect stage
could not be asked for.
I don't see any instruments.
Your powers of observation
continue to serve you well.
But wait. It is to Madame Justice
that I dedicate this concerto
in honor of the holiday she seems
to have taken from these parts
and in recognition of the impostor
that stands in her stead.
Tell me, do you know
what day it is, Evey?
Um...
- November the 4th?
- Not anymore.
[BELLS CHIMING]
Remember, remember
The 5th of November
The gunpowder treason and plot
I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason
Should ever be forgot
First, the overture.
Yes.
Yes, the strings.
Listen carefully, can you hear it?
Now the brass.
I can hear it!
[TCHAIKOVSKY'S "1812 OVERTURE"
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
Look outside, Mommy!
They're playing music!
- How do you do that?
- Wait.
Here comes the crescendo!
[V LAUGHING]
How beautiful, is it not?
Gentlemen, you have had four hours.
You had better have results. Mr. Creedy.
The Bailey area is quarantined.
All significant witnesses
have been detained.
Good. Mr. Etheridge?
A recording device was found wired into
the central emergency-broadcast system.
The DCD was Tchaikovsky's
1812 Overture.
Add it to the blacklist.
I never want to hear that music again.
Yes, sir.
We also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance
indicating a high percentage
of conversation about the explosion.
Mr. Dascomb,
what are we doing about that?
We're calling it
an emergency demolition.
We have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the InterLink.
Experts have been lined up to testify
against the Bailey's structural integrity.
I want Prothero to speak on
the dangers of these old buildings
and how we must avoid clinging
to the edifice of a decadent past.
He should conclude that the New Bailey
will become the symbol of our time
and the future
that our conviction has rewarded us.
Mr. Heyer.
Our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist
though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible.
We also managed to get a picture of
the girl that Creedy's men were detaining.
- Who is she, Mr. Finch?
- Not sure yet, sir.
- But we're working on several leads.
- Anything else?
We located the fireworks launch
and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites.
Unfortunately it appears that despite
the heavy level of sophistication
these devices were homemade
with over-the-counter chemicals
making them very difficult to trace.
Whoever he is, chancellor,
he's very good.
Spare us your professional annotations,
Mr. Finch. They are irrelevant.
Apologies, chancellor.
Gentlemen, this is a test.
Moments such as these
are matters of faith.
To fail is to invite doubt
into everything we believe,
everything we have fought for.
Doubt will plunge this country back
into chaos, and I will not let that happen.
Gentlemen, I want this
terrorist found
and I want him to understand
what terror really means.
England prevails.
ALL: England prevails.
[TV THEME MUSIC PLAYS]
- WOMAN: You think people will buy this?
- DASCOMB: Why not?
This is the BTN.
Our job is to report the news,
not fabricate it.
That's the government's job.
On the lighter side of things
seems that the crew responsible for
the demolition of the Old Bailey
wanted to give the old girl a grand,
albeit improvised, sendoff.
Although the demolition had been
planned for some time
the music and the fireworks were,
according to the crew chief,
- "definitely not on the schedule."
- MAN: 
[ON TV] We'll be right back.
Do you believe that load of bollocks?
I mean, there was no bloody demolition.
I saw it, the whole thing.
- Did you see it?
- No. Last night I was...
Yeah, that's right. You went
to see Daddy Deitrich, didn't you?
Evey, there you are.
- You are still working for me.
- Sorry, Patricia.
I need two espressos and three coffees.
And Deitrich is ready for his tea.
MAN: I don't get it.
Why does he wear a Guy Fawkes mask
and then blow up the Bailey?
Didn't Fawkes try to blow up Parliament?
It's not too late.
He's still got another 16 hours.
Maybe he's just getting started.
[PHONE RINGING]
Yeah?
Okay. A lead on the girl.
MAN: Look, don't get me wrong,
I love it. A cow getting crucified.
It's hysterical.
But you'll never get it approved.
You've got to rewrite it, okay? Gotta go.
I don't recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman.
- Mr. Deitrich...
- Gordon, please.
I don't need "mister" to make
this body feel any older.
Gordon...
I was on my way last night,
but there were Fingermen
and I got scared and went home.
Sadly, after last night,
I think our curfew will only get worse.
Gotcha.
- Hey, Fred.
- FRED: All that been x-rayed?
Nope. They're filled with bombs.
Well, wait till commercials
to set them off, okay?
- I can't believe you watch that shit.
FRED: What?
Laser Lass is banging.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
What's all that?
Not sure. They just arrived.
Marked for Stage 3.
Must be Prothero.
I wish someone had the balls to tell that
brat this station ain't his playground.
What the hell is this?
Just put them over there
until I can figure out what they're for.
This looks serious.
Her parents were political activists.
- They were detained when she was 12.
- What happened to her?
FINCH: Juvenile Reclamation Project
- for five years.
DOMINIC: Shit.
We're gonna need backup,
but keep it minimal.
You sure about that, sir?
I want a chance to talk to her
before she disappears
into one of Creedy's black bags.
Who's that?
Don't piss me about. You show me ID,
or I'll get Storm Saxon on your ass.
Fucking hell.
[TIRES SCREECHING]
MAN: Come on, let's move!
[BEEPING]
[ALARM WAILING]
You two, cover these elevators.
The rest of you follow me.
MAN: 
[OVER SPEAKER] Attention. Attention.
Will all personnel please
evacuate the building.
This is not a drill.
Will all personnel evacuate the building.
What the hell's going on?
- It's jammed.
- Break it down.
Dominic!
Police! Out of the way!
Get out the way!
Damn it!
I'll tell you what I know.
I'll tell you what I know.
I'll tell you what I know.
England prevails.
- Clear the halls.
OFFICER: Sir.
Help, Storm, help!
MAN: Don't touch it.
Dad, what's wrong with the telly?
V: Good evening, London.
- Allow me first to apologize.
- That's the emergency channel!
I do, like many of you, appreciate
the comforts of the everyday routine
the security of the familiar,
the tranquility of repetition.
Bloody hell.
I enjoy them as much as any bloke.
But in the spirit of commemoration...
- Who's that, Mum?
- Shh.
...whereby important events
of the past
usually associated
with someone's death
or the end of some awful,
bloody struggle
are celebrated with a nice holiday
I thought we could mark
this November the 5th
a day that is, sadly,
no longer remembered
by taking time out of our daily lives
to sit down and have a little chat.
There are, of course,
those who do not want us to speak.
Let me think, let me think.
Even now, orders are being shouted
into telephones
and men with guns
will soon be on their way.
- It's Chancellor Sutler.
- Damn it!
Why? Because while the truncheon
may be used in lieu of conversation
words will always retain their power.
Words offer the means to meaning
and, for those who will listen,
the enunciation of truth.
And the truth is
there is something terribly wrong
with this country, isn't there?
You designed it, you wanted it foolproof.
You said every television in London!
Cruelty and injustice,
intolerance and oppression.
And where once
you had the freedom to object
to think and speak as you saw fit
you now have censors and surveillance
coercing your conformity
- and soliciting submission.
- Cameras. We need cameras.
How did this happen?
Who's to blame?
Certainly there are those
who are more responsible than others.
And they will be held accountable.
But again, truth be told,
if you're looking for the guilty
you need only look into a mirror.
I know why you did it.
I know you were afraid.
Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease.
There were a myriad of problems
which conspired
to corrupt your reason
and rob you of your common sense.
Fear got the best of you.
And in your panic, you turned to
the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.
He promised you order,
he promised you peace
and all he demanded in return
was your silent, obedient consent.
- Inspector, they're almost through.
- Last night, I sought to end that silence.
Last night, I destroyed the Old Bailey
to remind this country
of what it has forgotten.
More than 400 years ago, a great citizen
wished to imbed the 5th of November
forever in our memory.
His hope was to remind the world
that fairness, justice and freedom
are more than words.
They are perspectives.
So if you've seen nothing,
if the crimes of this government
remain unknown to you,
then I would suggest that you allow
the 5th of November to pass unmarked.
But if you see what I see,
if you feel as I feel,
and if you would seek as I seek,
then I ask you to stand beside me,
one year from tonight
outside the gates of Parliament.
And together, we shall give them
a 5th of November
that shall never, ever be forgot.
Kerosene fog.
He's using our smoke machines.
Cover the exits.
No one gets out.
The rest of you, follow me.
Left.
You go right.
Spread out.
MAN 1:
Don't shoot! Please don't shoot!
FINCH:
Hold your fire!
[MAN GROANING]
He put masks on all of us.
Jesus.
- MAN 2: Don't shoot!
- MAN 3: Wait!
- MAN 4: Wait!
- MAN 5: Hold your fire!
Freeze! Nobody move!
If you're wearing a mask,
get down on your knees!
- Get their masks off.
- MAN 6: Please hurry!
There's a bomb in the control booth.
Oh, no.
- Get anyone not wearing a mask out.
- JONES: Yes, sir.
- Marshal, help carry this man.
- MARSHAL: Sir.
Everyone else, let's go.
[BEEPING]
Good God.
Hurry up, you lot! Come on!
Everybody out!
Dascomb.
Have you any idea how long
it would take to rebuild this facility?
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?
MAN 1:
Wait, wait!
Don't shoot me, please!
It's him! It's him!
On your knees! On your knees!
[MAN, MUFFLED]
Please! Please don't hurt me!
[WHIMPERING]
[KNIFE STABS]
Here we go.
I did it.
I did it.
Freeze!
Get your hands on your head.
Do it now or I shoot.
I must say that I am rather astonished
by the response time of London's finest.
I hadn't expected you to be
quite so Johnny-on-the-spot.
We were here before you even started.
Bad luck, chummy.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Aah!
We're interrupting your regular program
to bring you this terrifying report
of a terrorist takeover of Jordan Tower
which ended only moments ago.
A psychotic terrorist,
identified only as the letter V
attacked the control booth with
high-powered explosives and weapons
that he used against unarmed civilians
in order to broadcast a message of hate.
We've just received this footage
of a daring police raid.
OFFICER: 
[ON TV] Stop!
Stop, stay where you are, or we'll shoot!
Stay where you are!
Now, this is only an initial report
but at this time, it's believed
that during this heroic raid,
the terrorist was shot and killed.
Bollocks.
Again, from what we've been told
by authorities, the danger is now over.
The terrorist is dead.
FINCH:
Right there. What's he thinking?
Is he considering leaving her?
After she just saved him?
He's a terrorist. You can't expect him
to act like you or me.
Some part of him's human.
And, for better or worse,
she's stuck with him.
[JULIE LONDON'S "CRY ME A RIVER"
PLAYING NEARBY]
- You scared me.
- My apologies.
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes, thank you.
- What is this place?
- It's my home.
- I call it the Shadow Gallery.
- It's beautiful.
- Where did you get all this stuff?
- Oh, here and there.
Much of it from the vaults of
the Ministry of Objectionable Materials.
- You stole them?
- Heavens, no.
Stealing implies ownership.
You can't steal from the censor.
I merely reclaimed them.
God, if they ever find this place.
I suspect if they do, a few bits of art
will be the least of my worries.
EVEY:
You mean, after what you've done.
God, what have I done?
I Maced that detective.
Why did I do that?
- You did what you thought was right.
- No, I shouldn't have done that.
I must have been out of my mind.
Is that what you really think,
or what they'd want you to think?
I think I should go.
- May I ask where?
- Home. I have to go home.
They're looking for you.
If they know where you work,
they know where you live.
- I have friends, I could stay with them.
- I'm afraid that won't work either.
You have to understand, Evey,
I didn't want this for either of us
but I couldn't see any other way.
You were unconscious
and I had to make a decision.
If I had left you there, right now you'd be
in one of Creedy's interrogation cells.
They'd imprison you, torture you,
and, in all probability, kill you
in the pursuit of finding me.
After what you did,
I couldn't let that happen
so I picked you up and carried you
to the only place I knew you'd be safe:
Here, to my home.
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
You know you can trust me.
I'm sorry, but I can't take that risk.
But I don't even know where this is.
V: You know it's underground.
You know the color of the stone.
- That'd be enough for a clever man.
- Are you saying that I have to stay here?
Only until I'm done. After the 5th,
I no longer think it'll matter.
You mean a year from now?
I have to stay here for a year?
Sorry, Evey.
I didn't know what else to do.
You should've left me alone.
Why didn't you just leave me alone?
[V SIGHS]
[DOOR SLAMS]
- Anything else on the parents?
- Yeah, it ain't good.
They were interned at Belmarsh.
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.
She died in a hunger strike. He died
when the military retook the shed.
And that ain't the worst of it.
Her brother was at St. Mary's.
- Christ.
- It's nothing but bad luck here.
So we know her story.
Now we need his.
[STAN GETZ'S "THE GIRL FROM IPANEMA"
PLAYING ON JUKEBOX]
[V HUMMING]
V?
Ah. Bonjour, mademoiselle.
I just wanted to apologize
for my reaction last night.
I understand what you did for me,
and I want you to know I am grateful.
Your hands.
V: Yes.
[V HUMMING]
There, that's better.
I hope I didn't put you off
your appetite.
- No, please. It's just... Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, yes, I'm fine.
Can I ask what happened?
V: There was a fire. A long time ago.
Ancient history, for some.
Not really very good
table conversation.
Now, would you care for a cup of tea
with your egg?
- Yes, thank you. I'm starving, actually.
- Have a seat.
Mmm.
- It's delicious.
- Good.
God, I haven't had real butter
since I was a little girl.
Where did you get it?
V: A government supply train
on its way to Chancellor Sutler.
- You stole this from Chancellor Sutler?
- Yes.
You're insane.
V: I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares more is none.
- Macbeth.
- Very good.
My mum, she used to
read all his plays to me
and ever since,
I've always wanted to act.
Be in plays, movies.
When I was 9, I played Viola
in Twelfth Night. Mum was very proud.
V: Where is your mother now?
She's dead.
V: I'm sorry.
Can I ask about
what you said on the telly?
- Did you mean it?
- Every word.
You really think blowing up Parliament's
going to make this country a better place?
V: There's no certainty,
only opportunity.
You can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up,
Creedy'll black-bag
every one of them.
V: People should not be afraid
of their governments.
Governments should be afraid
of their people.
And you'll make that happen
by blowing up a building?
V: The building is a symbol,
as is the act of destroying it.
Symbols are given power by people.
Alone, a symbol is meaningless,
but with enough people,
blowing up a building
can change the world.
I wish I believed that was possible.
Every time I've seen this world change,
it's always been for the worse.
I'll tell you what I know.
I know this is not a man.
[TV AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
PROTHERO: What is he?
PROTHERO: 
[ON TV]
A man does not wear a mask.
- What is he?
- A man does not threaten civilians.
He's what every gutless,
freedom-hating terrorist is:
A goddamn coward!
[PHONE RINGING]
There will be no negotiation.
When I arrive in the morning,
the Paddy will be gone.
I'm looking at the tape right now,
and he has no idea how to light me.
My nose looks like Big fucking Ben.
Listen to me, you bleeding sod,
England prevails because I say it does!
So does every lazy cunt on this show,
and that includes you.
Find another DOP
or find yourself another job.
I'll tell you what I wish.
I wish I'd been there.
I wish I'd had the chance
for a face-to-face.
Just one chance, that's all I'd need.
This so-called V and his accomplice,
Evey Hammond
neo-demagogues,
spouting their message of hate.
A delusional and aberrant voice
delivering a terrorist's ultimatum.
An ultimatum that was met
with swift and surgically precise justice.
- No mercy!
- The moral, ladies and gentlemen, is:
TOGETHER:
Good guys win, bad guys lose
and, as always, England prevails!
Holy Christ! Jesus!
Good evening, Commander Prothero.
Oh, my God! How did you get in here?
Don't worry, I've made sure
our reunion won't be disturbed by
any pesky late-night phone calls,
commander.
Stop. Why do you keep calling me that?
That was your title, remember?
When we first met, all those years ago.
You wore a uniform in those days.
You.
- It is you.
- The Ghost of Christmas Past.
[PHONE RINGING]
- Yeah?
DASCOMB: Finch, it's Dascomb.
- Dascomb.
- I've already called the chancellor.
- We have to get control of the situation.
- What situation?
Chancellor Sutler agreed, for obvious
reasons, we have to keep this discreet.
In the wrong light,
the loss of the Voice of London
could be devastating
to our credibility.
Perhaps a stroke?
No, no, it's too horrific.
A quiet, dignified death in his sleep.
- We got any eyes or ears on this?
- No, camcos were cut.
It's the same M.O. as before.
But we got an elevator log ID.
- Let me guess.
- She's in deep, inspector.

Oh, God. I hope I didn't wake you.
No, I just thought you were fighting.
I mean, for real.
V: My favorite film:
The Count of Monte Cristo,
with Robert Donat as Edmond Dantes.
It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.
It gets me every time.
- Never seen it.
- Really?
- Would you like to?
- Does it have a happy ending?
V: As only celluloid can deliver.
Okay.
Put the sword away.
Forensics just wrapped.
No prints, no hair, no fibers.
The guy is like a ghost.
You won't believe
what they found on Prothero.
- Drugs?
- Could've started his own hospital.
- Interesting.
- Why?
Did you know Lewis Prothero was
one of the richest men in the country
before he was the Voice of London?
- Drugs?
- Legal ones.
Major stockholder
in Viadoxic Pharmaceutical.
Viadoxic and St. Mary's
in less than a week. Coincidence?
When you're at this as long as I've been,
you stop believing in coincidence.
May we come up?
- DANTES: You find your own tree.
- V: You find your own tree.
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.
- But it made me feel sorry for Mercedes.
- Why?
Because he cared more about revenge
than he did about her.
...nationwide were devastated
as news of the most popular...
Wait. What's this?
...most awarded stars
in the history of the BTN
a man known to the entire nation
as "The Voice of London"
passed away late last night
from apparent heart failure.
- She's lying.
- How do you know?
She blinks a lot when she does a story
she knows is false.
It came as no surprise
to those who knew him
that his body was at his office
where he often worked long hours
after everyone else had gone home.
Lewis, you will be sorely missed.
V, yesterday I couldn't find my ID.
You didn't take it, did you?
V: Would you prefer a lie or the truth?
Did you have anything
to do with that?
- Yes, I killed him.
- You.
- Oh, God.
- You're upset.
I'm upset?
You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.
I might have killed the Fingermen that
attacked you. I heard no objection.
- What?
- Violence can be used for good.
- What are you talking about?
- Justice.
Oh, I see.
V: There's no court in this country
for men like Prothero.
And are you going to kill more people?
V: Yes.
Take a look at this.
Prothero's military record.
What do you see?
Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria,
before and after, Sudan.
- Busy boy.
- But after all that
they put him in charge
of a detention facility at Larkhill.
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.
You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?
It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.
Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.
Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.
- You're welcome to review our records.
- We've been through your records.
All it says is that there was
a detention facility at Larkhill
approximately 10 miles
north of Salisbury.
Well, there you have it.
This is a matter of some urgency, major.
We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.
I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.
Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?
- Usual undesirables, I should think.
- But do you know?
- Of course not. I wasn't stationed there.
- Do you know who was?
I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records...
Your records are either deleted,
omitted or missing.
As head of the Detention Program
at that...
Before you go further, let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then.
Now we don't have the problems
we had back then.
We all did what we had to do.
And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.
That's all I have to say about that.
You can do this.
Hi.
I've been thinking.
There's something
I want to ask you
but I don't think you'll understand why
unless you know a few things about me.
My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.
He used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth
while politicians used them
to cover the truth up.
V: A man after my own heart.
He always told the best stories.
Until my brother died.
That was when everything changed.
My brother was one of the students
at St. Mary's.
After he died,
my parents became political.
They protested the war
and the Reclamation.
When Sutler was appointed high chancellor,
they were at the riot in Leeds.
I watched on the television,
thinking I was going
to see my parents killed.
I remember them arguing at night.
Mum wanted to leave the country.
Dad refused.
He said if we ran away,
they would win.
Win, like
it was a game.
[DOOR OPENS]
Evey, quick, hide!
- Mummy!
- EVEY'S MOTHER: Evey!
EVEY:
I never saw them again.
It was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth.
I'm sorry, Evey.
No, I'm the one that's sorry.
Sorry I'm not a stronger person.
Sorry I'm not like my parents.
I wish I was...
but I'm not.
I wish I wasn't afraid all the time...
but I am.
I know this world is screwed up.
Believe me, I know it better than most.
Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right,
please let me know.
V: If you wish.
Do you really think
you'll find something here?
Worth a shot.
One thing is true of all governments:
The most reliable records are tax records.
It appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost.
Probably during the Reclamation.
A lot of things went missing back then.
But I found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault.
Everything we've got on Larkhill
is in there.
Thanks. This is a great help.
[EVEY SPEAKING IN LATIN]
V: "By the power of truth, I, while living,
have conquered the universe."
- Personal motto?
- From Faust.
That's about trying
to cheat the devil, isn't it?
V: It is. And speaking of the devil,
I was wondering if your offer to help
was still standing.
- Of course.
- It appears that unforeseen circumstances
have accelerated my original plan.
As a result, I'm in need of someone
with some theatrical skill.
I'll do my best.
V: I believe you will.
Another doctor. Why does
a detention facility need so many doctors?
I don't know, but this is interesting.
The highest-paid person
at the camp was a priest.
- Really?
- Yeah, Father Lilliman.
- Lilliman.
- Was paid almost 200 grand a month.
Now, that is interesting.
Looks like he was promoted.
He's a bishop now.
- Your Grace.
- Oh, Denis.
- Has everything been arranged?
- Yes.
I've just received
your InterLink itinerary.
You should arrive in Perth
in time for Mass.
You're most diligent, Denis,
a noble example for all those
who labor in the name of our Lord, but...
- Your Grace?
- It wasn't labor I was speaking of.
It was, rather, my final remittance
that I was interested in.
My last little joy.
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
She has arrived, but there was
some confusion at the agency.
They've sent a new girl who,
I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.
Older?
Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?
That is for Your Grace to decide.
- Oh, my.
- Your Grace.
To think that I doubted your loveliness
for an instant.
Mea culpa, my child.
Mea culpa.
Your Grace, we don't have much time
and I have to tell you something.
A confession? I love the confession game.
Tell me your sins.
This isn't a game, Your Grace.
Someone's coming.
I think he means to kill you.
- I'm sorry?
- I'm telling you this
because I want some kind
of protection or amnesty.
I had nothing to do with the Bailey
and made a mistake in the Jordan Tower.
- I think this should balance it out.
- What are you talking about?
I'm Evey Hammond. I'm...
I've been the prisoner of the terrorist V
for the past several weeks.
I'm telling you that, any moment,
he's going to come through that door.
I unlocked the window in the room
where Denis told me to get ready.
[LAUGHING] Wonderful!
It's a game I've never played!
What a delightful mind you have.
I hope the rest of you
is just as interesting.
- No, please, you have to believe me.
- Oh, I do, I do, I do.
Let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs.
Stop it! Get off of me!
Seems I've captured
a dangerous terrorist.
Now, how best to procure
her confession?
Oh!
You little bitch.
You fucking little whore!
V: Reverend.
- Oh, my God.
She wasn't lying. It is you.
I'm sorry.
- I had to.
V: Evey!
And thus I clothe my naked villainy
with old odd ends
stolen forth from holy writ
and seem a saint,
when most I play the devil.
Oh, please, have mercy.
Oh, not tonight, Bishop.
Not tonight.
LILLIMAN: 
[OVER SPEAKER]
Don't do this, I beg of you.
Well, then.
Children's hour at the abbey.
V: Open your mouth
and stick out your tongue.
- What the...?
- LILLIMAN:I don't want to die!
This is Surveillance 109.
We have an emergency.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS]
Run every name in that file.
I want the whereabouts of all of them.
- Tonight.
- Yes, sir.
Pucker up, here comes the Finger.
Yeah. Get going. I'll handle him.
Creedy.
What are you doing here?
Several prominent party members
have been murdered, chief inspector.
This is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention.
The chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement.
It'll be hard to investigate
if you're detaining all my witnesses.
The security of information is paramount.
In these volatile times,
mistakes like Jordan Tower
can no longer be tolerated,
if, indeed,
Jordan Tower was an accident.
- What does that mean?
- Terrorist seems to have
a rather intimate understanding
of our system.
The chancellor suspects
there might be an informer.
Are you saying I'm under surveillance,
Mr. Creedy?
At this time, it would behoove you
to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed
and concentrate on the concerns
of our present.
You mean Larkhill?
Major Wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor.
- His loyalty is not in question.
- But mine is?
Your mother was Irish, wasn't she?
Terrible what St. Mary's
did to Ireland, wasn't it?
I've been a party member for 27 years.
If I were you, chief inspector,
I'd find the terrorist
and I'd find him soon.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
[SIREN WAILING NEARBY]
Please.
Evey? Good God!
I'm sorry.
I didn't know where else to go.
Yes, well, you better come inside
before someone sees you.
- Cheers.
- I know every cop's looking for me.
I know it's horrible of me
to put you in this situation.
- Evey...
- You could be in terrible trouble.
Evey, listen to me.
If the government searched my house,
you would be the least of my problems.
You trusted me.
It would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you.
Oh, my God.
That's God Save the Queen.
My parents took me to it
when they hung it at Gallery 12.
- I thought Sutler had it destroyed.
- He believes he did.
Cost me more than this house,
but no matter how bad I feel,
it always cheers me up.
- What is that?
- It's a copy of the Koran, 14th century.
- Are you a Muslim?
- No, I'm in television.
But why would you keep it?
I don't have to be Muslim to find
the images beautiful or poetry moving.
Is it worth it? If they found that here...
I told you,
you'd be the least of my worries.
Thank you, Gordon.
- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.
This whole thing started the night
he blew up the Old Bailey.
I was on my way here, and...
Ah.
Yes.
You see, we are both fugitives
in our own way.
- But...
- You're wondering why
you were invited here to supper
in the first place
if my appetites were
for less conventional fare.
Unfortunately, a man in my position
is expected to entertain
young and attractive ladies
like yourself.
Because in this world,
if I were to invite who I desired,
I would undoubtedly find myself
without a home, let alone a TV show.
- I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as I am.
The truth is, after so many years,
you begin to lose
more than just your appetite.
You wear a mask for so long,
you forget who you were beneath it.
I'm sorry, chief inspector.
Same basic toxicology as Prothero.
You could get these poisons
from any house in London.
Thanks, Delia.
DELIA:
Any leads on finding this guy?
Nothing yet. But there's something else
you can help me with.
You started as a botanist, didn't you?
It's... It's a Scarlet Carson.
They're believed to be extinct.
He leaves them at the crime scenes.
I'd appreciate it
if you could have a look at it.
Any information could be helpful.
- Of course.
- 
[PHONE RINGING]
Excuse me.
Yeah?
DOMINIC: I just finished
going through the file, inspector.
You better get back here.
FINCH: Yeah, okay.
- My God. He's killed them all.
- DOMINIC: All but one.
- FINCH: Who is she?
- DOMINIC: Not sure.
She's clearly one of the people
in charge at Larkhill.
But after they shut it down,
she disappeared for two years.
Till she applied for an overseas visa,
which was denied.
Running away?
Probably, because after that,
all record of her seems to stop.
- She changed her name.
- That's what I'm guessing.
I put a call in to the registry,
but I haven't heard back.
- It's late, or early.
- Call them again. I want that name.
What? Are you sure about that?
Okay. Thank you.
Dr. Diana Stanton changed her name
to Delia Surridge.
- The coroner?
- Yeah.
Jesus, I just saw her.
[WIND WHISTLING]
It's you, isn't it?
- You've come to kill me.
- V: Yes.
Thank God.
[SIREN WAILING]
OPERATOR: I'm sorry, but I can't get
a response from that number.
There's a problem with the connection.
Jesus Christ.
He's there.
DELIA: After what happened,
after what they did,
I thought about killing myself.
But I knew that one day
you'd come for me.
I didn't know what
they were going to do.
I swear to you.
Read my journal.
What they did was only possible
because of you.
Oppenheimer was able to change
more than the course of a war.
He changed the entire course
of human history.
Is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope?
I have not come
for what you hoped to do.
I've come for what you did.
It's funny.
I was given one of your roses today.
I wasn't sure you were the terrorist
until I saw it.
What a strange coincidence,
that I should be given one today.
There are no coincidences, Delia.
Only the illusion of coincidence.
I have another rose.
And this one is for you.
- You're going to kill me now?
- I killed you 10 minutes ago
while you slept.
- Is there any pain?
- No.
Thank you.
Is it meaningless to apologize?
V: Never.
I'm so sorry.
[SIREN WAILING]
Damn it.
FINCH: The terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it.
He wanted us to know the story,
or at least a part of it.
Am I to understand that you have read
this document, inspector?
- Yes, sir.
- Has anyone else read it?
- No, sir.
- Then let me make this perfectly clear.
The contents of this document
are a matter of national security
constituting an assault on the character
of several important party members
as well as a blatant violation
of the Articles of Allegiance.
As the authenticity of this document
cannot be verified,
it could be an elaborate forgery
created by the terrorist
as easily as it could be the deranged
fantasy of a former party member
who resigned for psychological reasons.
Any discussion of this document
or its contents
will be regarded, at the very least,
as an act of sedition
if not a willful act of treason.
- Is that understood, Mr. Finch?
- Yes, sir.
You would do well, inspector,
to put it out of your mind.
DELIA: May 23rd.
My first batch of subjects arrived today
and I have to admit that I'm very excited.
This could be the dawn of a new age.
Nuclear power is meaningless
in a world where a virus
can kill an entire population
and leave its wealth intact.
- GUARD 1: Stay together!
- GUARD 2: Come on, move!
DELIA: May 27th.
Commander Prothero toured the lab
with a priest, Father Lilliman,
who I was told is here to monitor
for Rules and Rights violations.
It made me nervous, but the commander
assured me there wouldn't be a problem.
June 2nd.
I keep wondering if these people knew
how they might be helping their country,
if they would act any differently.
They're so weak and pathetic.
They never look you in the eye.
I find myself hating them.
August the 18th.
Of the original four dozen,
over 75 percent are now deceased.
No controllable pattern has yet emerged.
September the 18th.
There is one case that continues
to give me hope.
He exhibits none of the immune-system
pathologies the other subjects developed.
I've discovered cellular anomalies in his
blood that I've been unable to categorize.
The mutations seem to have triggered
the abnormal development
of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.
The subject said
he could no longer remember
who he was or where he was from.
Whoever he was,
he is now the key to our dream
and the hope that all of this
will not have been in vain.
November the 5th.
It started last night, around midnight.
The first explosions tore open
the entire medical section.
All my work, gone.
I was trying to understand how
it could've happened when I saw him.
The man from room 5.
He looked at me.
Not with eyes. There were no eyes.
But I know he was looking at me
because I felt it.
[YELLS]
DELIA: Oh, God,
what have I done?
[STEN GETZ'S "CORCOVADO" PLAYING]
Bonjour, mademoiselle.
What is that you're making?
We called it "eggie in the basket."
My mum made them.
- This is weird.
- What?
The first morning I was with him,
he made me eggs just like this.
- Really?
- I swear.
That is a strange coincidence.
Although there's an obvious explanation.
- There is?
- Yes, Evey.
I am V.
At last you know the truth.
You're stunned, I know.
Hard to believe, isn't it, that beneath
this wrinkled, well-fed exterior,
there lies a dangerous killing machine
with a fetish for Fawkesian masks.
Viva la revoluciÃ³n.
That is not funny, Gordon.
Yeah, I know.
I'm useless without a studio audience.
I've seen people go to jail
for less than that.
Of course, he was right, wasn't he?
There is something wrong
with this country.
Morning, inspector.
You're at it early.
Is something wrong?
You don't look so good, sir.
[BEEPS]
I wanna ask a question, Dominic.
I don't care if you answer me or not.
I just wanna say this aloud.
But I need to know that this question
will not leave this office.
Yeah, of course, inspector, but...
Because of the terrorist?
No.
So, what is it, chief? What's going on?
The question I want to ask
is about St. Mary's
and Three Waters.
The question that's kept me up
for the last 24 hours,
the question I have to ask, is:
What if the worst,
the most horrifying biological attack
in this country's history
was not the work of religious extremists?
I don't understand. We know it was.
They were caught. They confessed.
And they were executed. I know.
And maybe that's really what happened.
But I see this chain of events...
these coincidences, and I have to ask:
What if that isn't what happened?
What if someone else unleashed that virus?
What if someone else
killed all those people?
Would you really wanna know who it was?
Sure.
Even if it was someone
working for this government?
That's my question.
If our own government was responsible
for what happened at St. Mary's
and Three Waters...
if our own government was responsible
for the deaths of almost 100,000 people,
would you really wanna know?
MAN 1: This has to be the bloody
coldest March in years.
WOMAN: Keep talking like that,
we'll lose our party status.
MAN 2:
They're a pack of lying hypocrites!
MAN 1: Keep it down, will you?
Based on random audio sweeps,
I've projected that right now
80 percent of the public
believe the terrorist is still alive.
We're also showing a 12-percent increase
over last month's positive mention
in all four quadrants.
SUTLER: Mr. Creedy?
- We're handling it as best we can.
Arrests are as high as they've been
since the Reclamation.
I want more than arrests. I want results.
[MUSIC PLAYING ON TV]
- What's all this about?
- I'm celebrating.
Celebrating what?
I think this could be
the best show we've ever done.
DEITRICH: 
[ON TV] Very good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
Listen, we've got an extraordinary
show for you tonight.
You're not gonna believe it.
As a matter of fact, I don't think I do.
Will you please give
a very warm welcome
to our own Chancellor Adam Sutler!
- 
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
- 
["GOD SAVES THE QUEEN" PLAYING]
- No way!
- No, it can't be!
We threw out the censor-approved script
and shot one I wrote this morning.
Oh, my God.
[GULPS]
Chancellor, chancellor, chancellor,
I understand you've been
under tremendous strain lately,
since the beginning
of this whole terrorism business,
and we thought it would be a nice idea
to try and help you relax. Girls?
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON TV]
Ah! Warm milk.
There's nothing better.
I understand you enjoy a glass
every night, chancellor.
Since I was a boy.
But you're wrong, Mr. Deitrich.
- The terrorist was never a concern.
- DEITRICH: Oh, really?
- Chancellor, chancellor...
- It's him.
Are you saying that
he's not still alive and active?
The terrorist has been neutralized.
[EXPLODES]
Oh, my God! Chancellor, look!
The terrorist!
FAKE SUTLER: The terrorist!
[LAUGHTER]
Get him!
Oh, dear.
[LAUGHING]
[BOOTS RANDOLPH'S "YAKETY SAX"

FAKE SUTLER: At last!
And now, for all the world to see.
It's him!
Unhand me! I am your chancellor!
How dare you! I am the chancellor!
Impostor!
Soldiers! That man is the terrorist!
- I order you to shoot that traitor!
- Liar!
- Faker!
- Fraud!
- Ready!
- Aim!
- Fire!
- Fire!
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
[SNICKERS]
What are they gonna do, fine us?
Big deal. We've got
the most-watched show on air.
Well, you're my agent,
that's what I pay you for.
Protect me.
I should've hired him to be my mother.
- You're mad.
- Either that or I wasn't breast-fed.
- Is everything a joke to you?
- Only the things that matter.
- What if they come after you?
- I tell you what's gonna happen.
I'll have to make some kind of apology,
do some boring fundraiser.
In the meantime, our ratings will go
through the roof. It'll be fine. Trust me.
[GLASS BREAKS]
Gordon?
[MEN SHOUTING]
Quick, Evey, hide!
Not so funny now, is it, funnyman?

MAN: Do you know why you're here,
Evey Hammond?
Please.
MAN: You've been formally charged
with three counts of murder,
the bombing of government property,
conspiracy to commit terrorism,
treason and sedition, the penalty
for which is death by firing squad.
You have one chance,
and only one chance, to save your life.
You must tell us the identity
or whereabouts
of code name V.
If your information leads to his capture,
you will be released
from this facility immediately.
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
You can return to your life, Miss Hammond.
All you have to do is cooperate.
Process her.

[SQUEAKING]
[RUSTLING]
WOMAN'S VOICE:
I know there's no way I can convince you
this is not one of their tricks,
but I don't care.
I am me.
My name is Valerie.
I don't think I'll live much longer.
I wanted to tell someone about my life.
This is the only autobiography
that I will ever write and, God,
I'm writing it on toilet paper.
I was born in Nottingham in 1985.
I don't remember much
of those early years
but I do remember the rain.
My grandmother owned a farm
in Tottle Brook
and she used to tell me
that God was in the rain.
I passed my 11 Plus
and went to girls' grammar.
It was at school
that I met my first girlfriend.
Her name was Sarah.
It was her wrists.
They were beautiful.
I thought we would
love each other forever.
I remember our teacher telling us
that it was an adolescent phase
that people outgrew.
Sarah did.
I didn't.
In 2002, I fell in love
with a girl named Christina.
That year I came out to my parents.
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
VALERIE: I couldn't have done it
without Chris holding my hand.
My father wouldn't look at me.
He told me to go and never come back.
[WOMAN CRYING]
VALERIE: My mother said nothing.
But I'd only told them the truth.
Was that so selfish?
Our integrity sells for so little,
but it is all we really have.
It is the very last inch of us.
But within that inch,
we are free.
MAN:
It ends whenever you want it to.
- Just tell us where he is.
- I don't know.
VALERIE: I'd always known
what I wanted to do with my life
and in 2015, I starred in my first film,
The Salt Flats.
It was the most important role of my life.
Not because of my career,
but because that was how I met Ruth.
The first time we kissed,
I knew I never wanted to kiss
any other lips but hers again.
We moved to a small flat
in London together.
She grew Scarlet Carsons for me
in our window box
and our place always smelt of roses.
Those were the best years of my life.
But America's war grew worse and worse
and eventually came to London.
The bill proposed by the Undersecretary
for Defense, Adam Sutler
to close the remaining tube stations
passed with near-universal...
VALERIE:
After that, there were no roses anymore.
Not for anyone.
MAN: You won't last much longer.
You're gonna die here.
Why protect someone
who doesn't give a shit about you?
[DOOR SLAMS, LOCKS]
VALERIE: I remember how the meaning
of words began to change.
How unfamiliar words like "collateral"
and "rendition" became frightening,
while things like "Norsefire" and the
"Articles of Allegiance" became powerful.
I remember how "different"
became dangerous.
I still don't understand it,
why they hate us so much.
[GRUNTS]
VALERIE: They took Ruth
while she was out buying food.
I've never cried so hard in my life.
It wasn't long till they came for me.
It seems strange that my life should end
in such a terrible place.
But for three years,
I had roses and apologized to no one.
I shall die here.
Every inch of me shall perish.
Every inch
but one.
An inch.
It is small, and it is fragile
and it is the only thing
in the world worth having.
We must never lose it or give it away.
We must never let them take it from us.
I hope that, whoever you are,
you escape this place.
I hope that the world turns
and that things get better.
But what I hope most of all
is that you understand what I mean
when I tell you that
even though I do not know you
and even though
I may never meet you,
laugh with you, cry with you,
or kiss you...
I love you.
With all my heart,
I love you.
Valerie.
MAN: I'm instructed to inform you
that you have been convicted
by special tribunal
and that unless you are ready
to offer your cooperation,
you are to be executed.
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
- Yes.
- Are you ready to cooperate?
- No.
- Very well.
Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell.
Arrange a detail of six men
and take her out behind
the chemical shed and shoot her.
MAN: It's time.
I'm ready.
MAN: Look, all they want
is one little piece of information.
Just give them something, anything.
Thank you,
but I'd rather die
behind the chemical sheds.
MAN: Then you have no fear anymore.
You're completely free.
What?
Hello, Evey.
You.
- It was you?
- Yeah.
That wasn't real?
- Is Gordon...?
- I'm sorry, but Mr. Deitrich's dead.
I thought they'd arrest him
but when they found a Koran
in his house, they had him executed.
Oh, God.
- Fortunately, I got to you before they did.
- You got to me?
You did this to me?
You cut my hair?
You tortured me?
You tortured me.
Why?
V: You said you wanted to live without
fear. I wish there'd been an easier way
- but there wasn't.
- Oh, my God.
I know you may never forgive me
but nor will you understand
how hard it was for me.
Every day, I saw in myself
everything you see in me now.
Every day, I wanted to end it.
But each time you refused to give in,
I knew I couldn't.
You're sick! You're evil!
You could have ended it.
You could have given in, but you didn't.
- Why?
- Leave me alone! I hate you!
V: That's it! See, at first,
I thought it was hate too.
Hate was all I knew.
It built my world, imprisoned me,
taught me how to eat,
how to drink, how to breathe.
I thought I'd die
with all the hate in my veins.
But then something happened.
It happened to me
just as it happened to you.
Shut up! I don't want to hear
your lies!
V: Your own father said
that artists use lies to tell the truth.
Yes, I created a lie.
But because you believed it,
you found something true about yourself.
- No.
- What was true in that cell is true now.
What you felt in there
has nothing to do with me.
I can't feel anything anymore!
Don't run from it, Evey.
You've been running all your life.
[GASPING]
I can't. Can't breathe.
Asthma. When I was little...
Listen to me, Evey.
This may be the most important moment
of your life. Commit to it.
[SOBBING]
They took your parents from you.
They took your brother from you.
They put you in a cell
and took everything they could take,
except your life.
And you believed that was all
there was, didn't you?
The only thing you had left
was your life, but it wasn't.
- Oh, please.
- You found something else.
In that cell, you found something
that mattered more to you than life.
When they threatened to kill you
unless you gave them what they wanted,
you told them you'd rather die.
You faced your death, Evey.
You were calm. You were still.
Try to feel now what you felt then.
Oh, God.
I felt.
V: Yes?
I'm dizzy.
I need air.
Please, I need to be outside.
V: There's a lift.
It'll take us to the roof.

[CAT POWER'S "I FOUND A REASON" PLAYING]
V.
I'm leaving.
There are 872 songs in here.
I've listened to them all,
but I've never danced to any of them.
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.
I can't stay here.
V: I know.
Well, you won't find
any more locked doors here.
I thought about keeping this
but it didn't seem right,
knowing you wrote it.
I didn't.
May I show you something before you go?
- She was real.
- Yes.
She's beautiful.
- Did you know her?
- No.
She wrote the letter
just before she died.
And I delivered it to you
as it had been delivered to me.
Then it really happened, didn't it?
- Yes.
- You were in the cell next to her.
And that's what this is all about.
You're getting back at them
for what they did to her.
- And to you.
- What was done to me created me.
It's a basic principle of the universe
that every action will create
an equal and opposing reaction.
Is that how you see it?
- Like an equation?
- What was done to me was monstrous.
And they created a monster.
- Do you know where you'll go?
- No.
That would have scared me before
but I suppose I should thank you.
Well.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Evey...
may I ask you for something?
If I had one wish, I would wish
to see you again, if only once
before the 5th.
- All right.
- Thank you.
[SOBBING]
HEYER: Chancellor, I know no one
seems to want to discuss this
but if we're to be prepared
for any eventuality,
then it can't be ignored any longer.
The red report in front of you has been
vetted by several demolition specialists.
Now, it concludes that
the most logical delivery system
for the terrorist to use
would be an airborne attack.
A separate report has been filed
suggesting a train, despite the fact
that the tunnels surrounding Parliament
have been sealed shut.
Who filed that report?
HEYER: Chief Inspector Finch.
Do you have any evidence
to support this conclusion, Mr. Finch?
No, sir. Just a feeling.
If I am sure of anything, inspector,
it is that this government won't survive
if it is to be subject to your feelings.
Mr. Dascomb, what we need right now
is a clear message
to the people of this country.
This message must be read
in every newspaper,
heard on every radio,
seen on every television.
This message must resound
throughout the entire InterLink!
I want this country to realize
that we stand on the edge of oblivion.
I want every man, woman and child to
understand how close we are to chaos.
I want everyone
to remember why they need us!
In the former United States, civil war
continues to devastate the Midwest.
Scientists attribute this water shortage
to the lack of rainfall the last two years.
Ministry officials expect
water coupon prices to rise.
Police have arrested nine suspects.
Can you believe this shit?
Been going on all summer.
Outside the quarantine zone, a new
airborne pathogen has killed 27 people.
Authorities uncovered new evidence
linking the terrorist organization called V
to the St. Mary's viral attack
on London 14 years ago.
[DEVICE BEEPS]
DOMINIC: My friend inside the Finger
came up with something.
There were three men.
Covert intel.
Original black-baggers,
all under Creedy.
FINCH: Alan Percy, Robert Keyes,
William Rookwood.
The day after the St. Mary's outbreak,
Percy gives his Beretta a blowjob,
Keyes dies in a fire...
Rookwood goes missing.
Bloody coincidences
are making me sick to my stomach.
Rookwood.
How do I know that name?
DOMINIC: Holy shit. He must have had
a hidden trip on his file at the Finger.
But how'd he know it was you?
What do we do?
I'm a cop. I have to know.
I came when they opened it.
It gave me the collywobbles.
Still does.
That's close enough, inspector.
[DEVICE BEEPS]
We're not wired.
I'm sorry, but a man in my position
survives by taking every precaution.
- You have information for us?
- No, you already have the information.
All the names and dates
are inside your head.
What you want,
what you really need, is a story.
A story can be true or false.
I leave such judgments to you,
inspector.
Our story begins,
as these stories often do,
with a young, up-and-coming politician.
He's a deeply religious man
and a member of the Conservative Party.
He's completely single-minded and
has no regard for the political process.
The more power he attains,
the more obvious his zealotry
and the more aggressive
his supporters become.
Eventually, his party launches a special
project in the name of national security.
At first it's believed to be a search
for biological weapons
and it's pursued without regard
to its cost.
However, the true goal
of this project is power.
Complete and total hegemonic domination.
The project, however, ends violently.
But the efforts of those involved
are not in vain
for a new ability to wage war is born
from the blood of one of the victims.
Imagine a virus,
the most terrifying virus you can
and then imagine that you
and you alone have the cure.
But if your ultimate goal is power,
how best to use such a weapon?
Well, it's at this point in our story
that along comes a spider.
A man seemingly without a conscience
for whom the ends
always justify the means.
And it's he who suggests that their target
should not be an enemy of the country,
but rather, the country itself.
Three targets are chosen
to maximize the effect of the attack:
A school, a tube station
and a water-treatment plant.
Several hundred die
within the first few weeks.
Three Waters has, in fact,
been contaminated.
Authorities are attempting to control
its deadly spread.
...sent a wave of destruction
through the Underground.
ROOKWOOD: Fueled by the media,
fear and panic spread quickly,
fracturing and dividing
the country until, at last,
the true goal comes into view.
Before the St. Mary's crises,
no one would've predicted the results
of the election that year. No one.
And then not long after the election,
Io and behold, a miracle.
Some believed it was the work
of God himself.
But it was a pharmaceutical company
controlled by certain party members
that made them all obscenely rich.
A year later, several extremists are tried,
found guilty and executed,
while a memorial is built
to canonize their victims.
But the end result,
the true genius of the plan, was the fear.
Fear became the ultimate tool
of this government.
Through it, our politician
was ultimately appointed
to the newly created position
of high chancellor.
The rest, as they say, is history.
- Can you prove any of this?
- Why do you think I'm still alive?
All right. We'd like to take you into
protective custody, Mr. Rookwood.
I'm sure you would.
But if you want that recording,
you'll do what I tell you to do.
Put Creedy under 24-hour surveillance.
When I feel safe he can't pick his nose
without you knowing,
I'll contact you again.
Till then, cheerio.
FINCH: Rookwood...
why didn't you come forward before?
What were you waiting for?
Well, for you, inspector.
I needed you.
V: Shh, shh, shh.
[BEETHOVEN'S "SYMPHONY NO. 5"
PLAYING OVER SPEAKER]
What's he doing in the dark there?
Creepy Creedy.
Not sure I wanna know.
Sutler can no longer trust you,
can he, Mr. Creedy?
And we both know why.
After I destroy Parliament,
his only chance will be to offer them
someone else, some other piece of meat.
And who will that be?
You, Mr. Creedy.
A man as smart as you
has probably considered this.
A man as smart as you
probably has a plan.
That plan is the reason
Sutler no longer trusts you.
It's the reason why
you're being watched right now,
why there are eyes and ears
in every room of this house
- and a tap on every phone.
- Bollocks.
Oh, a man as smart as you, I think,
knows otherwise.
- What do you want?
- Sutler.
Come, now, Mr. Creedy,
you knew this was coming.
You knew that one day, it'd be you or him.
That's why Sutler's been kept
underground for security purposes.
That's why there are several
of your men close to Sutler,
men that can be counted on.
All you have to do is say the word.
- What do I get out of this deal?
- Me.
If you accept,
put an X on your front door.
Why should I trust you?
Because it's the only way
you're ever going to stop me.
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ON TV]
DANTES: It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.
May we come up?
You find your own tree.
DOMINIC: We got Creepy pinned
like a butterfly for weeks.
Still no word. What's he waiting for?
[PHONE RINGING]
Yeah? Inspector, it's for you.
- Yeah.
MAN: Is that Chief Inspector Finch?
- It is.
- This is Captain Clark
of the 137th Ward at Southend.
- We found him.
- Found who?
William Rookwood,
the one you're looking for.
I saw your report a couple weeks back,
thought I'd run it through our John Does.
I hooked him. Perfect dental match.
A floater. Fishermen picked him up.
No ID, never solved. Till now, that is.
- William Rookwood is dead?
- I'd say so. Twenty years now.
Goddamn it!
That son of a bitch sat there
and spoon-fed me that bullshit,
and I ate it up!
So, what do we do now, inspector?
We do what we should
have been doing.
We find him.
[SPRAY CAN HISSING]
[SPRAY CAN RATTLING]
Every day, gentlemen.
Every day that brings us closer
to November,
every day that man remains free
is one more failure.
Three hundred and forty-seven days,
gentlemen.
Three hundred and forty-seven failures!
Chancellor, we do not have
the adequate force...
We are being buried beneath the avalanche
of your inadequacies, Mr. Creedy!
[DOORBELL RINGS]
I'll get it.
- Eric Finch?
- Yeah.
Bloody hell.
- 
[PHONES RINGING]
- How many went out?
So far we count eight boxcars.
- Several hundred thousand, at least.
- Christ.
I want anyone caught
with one of those masks arrested!
MAN: Give me the money!
Give me the fucking money!
We're under siege here.
The whole city's gone mad.
- This is exactly what he wants.
- What?
- MAN: Anarchy in the UK!
- Chaos.
Mr. Creedy, I am holding you
personally responsible for this situation.
FINCH: The problem is that he knows us
better than we know ourselves.
That's why I went to Larkhill last night.
- That's outside quarantine.
- I had to see it.
There wasn't much left.
But when I was there, it was strange.
I suddenly had this feeling
that everything was connected.
Like I could see the whole thing.
One long chain of events that stretched
all the way back before Larkhill.
I felt like I could see everything
that had happened...
and everything that was going to happen.
FINGERMAN: Hey, you!
It was like a perfect pattern
laid out in front of me...
and I realized that
we were all a part of it...
and all trapped by it.
[BELL TOLLS]
So do you know what's gonna happen?
No. It was a feeling.
But I can guess.
With so much chaos,
someone will do something stupid.
And when they do,
things will turn nasty.
[INAUDIBLE]
Rioters were arrested in Brixton.
And then Sutler will be forced to do
the only thing he knows how to do.
At which point,
all V needs to do is keep his word.
And then.
[CLOCK BEEPS]
[RICHARD HAWLEY'S "LONG BLACK TRAIN"
PLAYING ON RADIO]
Tonight's your big night.
You ready for it?
Are we ready for it?
[JULIE LONDON'S "CRY ME A RIVER"
PLAYING ON JUKEBOX]
I missed this song.
V: I didn't think you'd come.
- I said I would.
- Ah.
You look well.
Thank you.
V: May I inquire as to how
you've avoided detection?
A fake ID works better
than a Guy Fawkes mask.
[V CHUCKLES]
I must confess, every time
I heard a siren, I worried about you.
I worried about myself for a while.
But then, one day, I was at a market
and a friend, someone I had worked
with at the BTN, got in line behind me.
I was so nervous that when the cashier
asked me for my money, I dropped it.
My friend picked it up
and handed it to me.
She looked at me right in the eyes...
didn't recognize me.
Whatever you did to me worked better
than I'd have imagined.
I have a gift for you, Evey.
But before I give it to you,
I'd like to ask you something.
Would you dance with me?
Now? On the eve of your revolution?
V: Oh, a revolution without dancing
is a revolution not worth having.
I'd love to.
Tonight, I will speak directly
to these people
and make the situation
perfectly clear to them.
The security of this nation depends
on complete and total compliance.
Tonight, any protester,
any instigator or agitator
will be made example of!
[CLEARING THROAT]
Chancellor, there is a contingency
that has not been addressed.
And what is that, Mr. Dascomb?
- Should the terrorist succeed...
- He won't.
I understand that it is highly unlikely,
but if he does...
If he does, and something happens
to that building,
the only thing that will change,
the only difference it will make
is that tomorrow morning,
instead of a newspaper,
I will be reading
Mr. Creedy's resignation!
[ANTONY AND THE JOHNSONS' "BIRD GERHL"
PLAYING ON JUKEBOX]
You've been busy.
They're very scared right now.
I heard Sutler's going to make
a public statement tonight.
Hmm, it's nearly time.
The masks were ingenious.
It was strange to suddenly see
your face everywhere.
Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
for such disguise as haply
shall become the form of my intent.
- EVEY: Twelfth Night.
- Viola.
- I don't understand.
- What?
How you can be one of the most
important things that's happened to me
and yet I know
almost nothing about you.
I don't know where you were born,
who your parents were,
if you had any brothers or sisters.
I don't even know
what you really look like.
Evey, please.
There is a face beneath this mask,
but it's not me.
I'm no more that face than I am
the muscles beneath it
or the bones beneath them.
I understand.
Thank you.
There isn't much time.
I have something I must give you.
I went by Parliament.
Never seen anything like it.
Tanks, anti-aircraft, infantry.
Makes you wish that no one
would show up tonight.
But if they do,
what do you think will happen?
What usually happens
when people without guns
stand up to people with guns.
Pull over here.
We've searched these tunnels for weeks.
You think you're gonna find him now?
Inspector.
It's all gone wrong, hasn't it?
The Underground?
I thought they closed this all down.
They did.
It took nearly 10 years to
clear the tracks and lay a bit of my own.
Let me show you.
- These tracks lead to Parliament.
- Yes.
Then it's really going to happen,
isn't it?
V: It will if you want it to.
- What?
- This is my gift to you, Evey.
Everything that I have: my home,
my books, the gallery, this train,
I'm leaving to you to do with
what you will.
Is this another trick, V?
V: No. No more tricks. No more lies.
Only truth.
And the truth is, you made me
understand that I was wrong,
that the choice to pull this lever
is not mine to make.
- Why?
- Because this world,
the world that I'm a part of and
that I helped shape, will end tonight.
And tomorrow,
a different world will begin
that different people will shape,
and this choice belongs to them.
Where are you going?
The time has come for me
to meet my maker
and to repay him in kind
for all that he's done.
V, wait!
Please, you don't have to do this.
You could let it go.
We could leave here together.
No. You were right about what I am.
I have no tree waiting for me.
All I want, all I deserve,
is at the end of that tunnel.
That's not true.
I can't.
My fellow Englishmen...
tonight, our country,
that which we stand for
and all that we hold dear,
faces a grave and terrible threat.
SOLDIER: The area's clean, sir.
This violent and unparalleled assault
to our security
will not go undefended...
Where is he?
...or unpunished.
V: Penny for the Guy.
Our enemy is an insidious one,
seeking to divide us
and destroy the very foundation
of our great nation.
V: I have kept my side of the bargain,
but have you kept yours?
Bring him down.
Tonight we must remain steadfast.
We must remain determined.
But most of all, we must remain united.
Those caught tonight
in violation of curfew
will be considered in league
with our enemy
and prosecuted as a terrorist
without leniency or exception.
I want to see his face.
Tonight, I give you my most solemn vow
thatjustice will be swift,
it will be righteous,
and it will be without mercy.
Oh, God. No.
V: At last, we finally meet.
[SOBBING]
I have something for you, chancellor.
A farewell gift.
For all the things you've done,
for the things you might have done,
and for the only thing you have left.
Goodbye, chancellor.
Mr. Creedy.
Disgusting.
[GUNSHOT ECHOES]
Now that's done with,
it's time to have a look at your face.
Take off your mask.
V: No.
[MEN GRUNTING]
Defiant to the end, huh?
You won't cry like him, will you?
You're not afraid of death.
You're like me.
The only thing you and I
have in common, Mr. Creedy,
is we're both about to die.
How do you imagine that's gonna happen?
With my hands around your neck.
Bollocks.
What are you gonna do, huh?
We've swept this place.
You've got nothing.
Nothing but your bloody knives
and your fancy karate gimmicks.
We have guns.
No, you have bullets and the hope
that when your guns are empty,
I'm no longer standing, because if I am,
you'll all be dead before you've reloaded.
That's impossible!
Kill him.
[BREATHING HEAVILY]
V: My turn.
[YELLS]
[SCREAMS]
Die! Die!
Why won't you die?
- 
[GUN CLICKS]
- Why won't you die?
Beneath this mask,
there is more than flesh.
Beneath this mask there is an idea,
Mr. Creedy.
And ideas are bulletproof.
[BONE SNAPS]

[HELICOPTER WHIRRING]
This is perimeter one.
Whitehall is secure. Over.
MAN: This is General Ackroyd.
Keep communication tight.
I won't have this getting any more
bollixed up than it already is.
V!
[V GASPING]
Oh, God, we have to stop your bleeding.
Please, don't.
I'm finished and glad of it.
Don't say that.
I told you, only truth.
For 20 years, I sought only this day.
Nothing else existed...
until I saw you.
Then everything changed.
I fell in love with you, Evey...
like I no longer believed I could.
V, I don't want you to die.
That's the most beautiful thing
you could have ever given me.
V?
V?
[SOBBING]
Eyes and ears have detected movement
heading towards Trafalgar Square.
This is perimeter one.
We have enemy contact.
Hold it. Stop right there.
You're Evey Hammond, aren't you?
Then it's over?
Almost.
Stop. Get your hand off that lever.
No.
LIEUTENANT: Enemy is approaching fast.
Requesting orders.
- What shall we do?
- No response from Command.
Or from Party Leader Creedy.
Or from the high chancellor.
Why are you doing this?
- Because he was right.
- About what?
That this country needs more than
a building right now. It needs hope.
Bloody hell, stand down! Stand down!
Jesus bloody Christ.
[BELL TOLLING]
It's time.
Tell me...
do you like music, Mr. Finch?
[TCHAIKOVSKY'S "1812 OVERTURE"
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
That music?
Yes.
His music.
[BELL TOLLS]
[FIREWORKS WHISTLING]
Who was he?
He was Edmond Dantes.
And he was my father
and my mother.
My brother.
My friend.
He was you...
and me.
He was all of us.
EVEY:
No one will ever forget that night
and what it meant for this country.
But I will never forget the man
and what he meant to me.
