It has been one tough year for our school, but that all ends this Saturday!
Because that's when this team, my Warriors, are gonna burn those pansy-ass Ohio players right to the ground!
And stop acting like a little bitch baby.
Do not tell me how to feel right now!
Sorry it took so long.
I went back for this.
Now, you -- you take that back right now!
No. It's smart.
Commonwealth v. Deloatche --
A case the prosecution should've won but lost because there was no murder weapon.
- So, what are you saying?
- We clean it and we put it back.
Hide it in plain sight.
After we bury the body.
No, absolutely not.
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm with Michaela.
No, Connor, think.
The trophy we need, yes. But the body stays where it is.
No, the body is what gets us caught.
You are not thinking straight.
What do you suggest?!
Something that doesn't involve carrying a body across campus on the busiest night of the year!
She's right, Laurel.
Even if we get it out of the house, unseen, the ground is frozen!
We have all night to dig.
You don't know what you're talking about!
This is murder! None of us know what we're talking about!
Please, just yell that a little louder!
Honestly, you're all dumber than
I thought if you think we should go back there.
- Look, I'm agreeing with you -- - Going back is an idiotic...
You two need to man up and think because we're going to jail.
Shut up! Shut up!
It's two against two.
We have no other choice. We flip a coin.
- That is the dumbest thing - I'm not letting a freaking coin you've ever said. decide whether or not I go to jail tonight!
We don't have time to fight!
We need to make a decision and commit to it.
So if someone has a better idea, say it now!
Heads, we get the body.
Tails, we leave it where it is. Okay?
I threw up four times this morning
- worried she's gonna call on me.
- Yeah, she's a ballbuster, sure, but I spent my summer interning for Chief Justice Roberts,
- so I know how to - Dershowitz has the upper hand
- handle a big personality. - in the academic world, but Keating's clearly the better defense attorney.
Here we go.
I'm not usually a first-row kind of guy, but I promised myself I wouldn't hide in the back of the class.
I'm engaged.
Oh. Oh, no. I-I wasn't hitting on...
Seats are assigned. There's a chart over there.
Nice try, player.
- No. I wasn't trying anything...
- You should find your seat.
You don't want to be a sitting duck when the shooter gets here.
What?
Oh, my God. You have no idea what you just walked into.
Good morning.
I don't know what terrible things you've done in your life up to this point, but clearly your karma's out of balance to get assigned to my class.
I'm professor Annalise Keating, and this is criminal law 100.
Or, as I prefer to call it...
...how to get away with murder.
Unlike many of my colleagues,
I will not be teaching you how to study the law or theorize about it,
But rather how to practice it -- in a courtroom, like a real lawyer.
Now to our first case study, the Aspirin Assassin.
Tell us the facts...
...Connor Walsh.
The Commonwealth v. Gina Sadowski was a case of attempted murder.
The defendant, Ms. Sadowski, worked as the Second Assistant to the victim, Arthur Kaufman, the C.E.O. of an advertising agency.
Ms. Sadowski was not only his assistant, though.
She was also his mistress.
What happened after Mr. Kaufman's wife of 27 years,
Agnes, found out about the affair?
You.
He ended the relationship and transferred her to the accounting department.
That's when she allegedly switched one of his blood-pressure pills for an aspirin, which she knew he was allergic to.
What occurred when Mr.
Kaufman ingested the aspirin?
Anyone?
Mr. Kaufman went into anaphylactic shock.
His throat swelled and his brain was deprived of oxygen for 7 minutes before his First Assistant was able to resuscitate him.
Michaela Pratt.
So, we've established the actus reus.
What was the mens rea?
Wesley Gibbins?
The...mens rea?
Right.
Day 1 and you're unprepared?
No.
Well, um, yes, but I didn't know there was anything to prepare.
I e-mailed the assignment to the entire class two days ago.
Oh. I...didn't get that.
Mr. Gibbins, as a defense attorney,
I spend most of my time around professional liars, so you have to work really hard to fool me.
I only got accepted here two days ago... from the wait list, so that's probably why you didn't get my e-mail address.
Let me help you out.
"Actus reus" means "Guilty act" -- the poisoning of Mr. Kaufman with an aspirin -- whereas "Mens rea" means "Guilty mind."
So what was Ms. Sadowski's mens rea?
Think, Mr. Gibbins.
It's nothing more than common sense.
To kill.
Will the individual who just spoke please stand and repeat the answer?
The mens rea, also referred to as "Intent," was to kill Mr. Kaufman.
That's right. Your name?
Laurel Castillo.
Never take a learning opportunity away from another student, no matter how smart you need everyone to think you are.
All right, before we move on, are there any other questions?
Mr. Walsh.
I noticed that the verdict wasn't listed here.
So I guess my question is, did she do it?
Why don't you ask her yourself?
I lied.
This isn't a past case but one I took last week after Gina fired her previous lawyer.
This one day, I walked into his office when I just screamed, real loud,
'cause Arthur was standing there behind the door.
I thought he was gonna be pissed at me, yell, but instead he just started laughin'.
So then I started laughin' and, well, um, that's when he kissed me for the first time and... yeah, I became that girl.
Something tells me she's always been "That girl."
It was on my last day workin' for him when I came back from lunch and saw the paramedics.
When I heard that Arthur was hurt...
I loved him.
I know that's hard to believe, but I loved him.
Why in the hell would I want to hurt him?
The trial begins in two days, so tomorrow, each of you have one minute to present the best defense for this case.
See if you can beat my current plan.
Mr. Gibbins?
Yes?
You'll go last, an unenviable position seeing that no two students will be allowed to present the same idea.
Use the resources in this office --
Gina's discovery file, my library, the people who know me even better than myself -- my associates.
Name's Frank, and unlike every teacher you've had,
I do believe there are stupid questions.
So if you got 'em, please see my lovely colleague Bonnie.
Or, better, you could come to us with answers.
We'll like you much better that way.
And one more thing.
Every year I choose four students to come work for me.
This assignment is used to help me decide who that is.
The top student gets this.
Consider this your immunity idol.
You -- you take that back right now!
The winner can turn this in at any point to get out of an exam.
Now go.
Find a defense that will free our client.
The First Assistant saw Gina with an aspirin that morning.
Forensics found aspirin residue on the plate.
She was warned about the allergy first day on the job, which means we should argue... we should argue... which means we should argue... we should argue... means we should argue... she's guilty.
Hi. Wes.
I just moved in next door.
- What do you want? - Uh, your music...
I normally wouldn't ask to turn it down.
But today was my first day of law school and I have --
- No. - What?
The last guy who lived in your apartment was a law student.
I put up with his crazy-loud rabbit sex, his nervous breakdown.
You can deal with this.
Michaela.
I never agreed to this!
The coin did, so I'm gonna stand here and not see anything so when I'm called to testify, I can say just that.
I just want you to move your feet.
What?
Here.
I wiped the sink down with bleach after I washed it.
Now what?
We put it back.
Let's just get the hell out of here. Now.
I'll help.
Fine.
This car one of yours?
- It's my car, sir. - You're blocking the sidewalk.
Oh. Uh, right.
I can -- I can move it right now.
This that law professor's office?
Yes. Professor Keating.
We're her law students, but she's out of town and told us to take this old rug to the bonfire.
She asked you to go into her house and burn a rug for her?
It sounds weird, I know.
Why don't I give her a call so she can explain to you herself?
Uh...it's a little late to call her, don't you think?
The nice officer here thinks we're burgling our professor's house.
- Right. - Let's just clear this whole thing up.
I mean, it is a little late.
Oh, God, and she had to go to her mother's funeral today.
But maybe she's not asleep yet.
- This'll burn good! - It's fine. Just --
Damn it.
Be safe, okay? There's a ton of crazies out tonight.
Where the hell has that girl been all night?
We should offer the jury another suspect altogether --
Mr. Kaufman's wife, Agnes.
She was angry about the affair, had access to his office, and knew what aspirin looked like his blood-pressure pill.
So what better way to get revenge than to kill your cheating husband and pin it on his mistress?
Thank you.
Take a seat, Ms. Pratt.
You've moved on to the next round.
Who's next?
It all comes down to a simple piece of evidence -- that the doctor "claims" he ran Mr. Kaufman's blood work too late to find any aspirin in his blood.
A statistical breakdown of the jury pool shows 80% of them come from a low socioeconomic class.
Yes, Gina put the pill on his desk.
But did she have the intent to kill?
Our client mistook the aspirin as his blood-pressure medication...
The issues at play are complicated and in need of more extensive research...
So without a witness to assure that, um...
Do we really trust this doctor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury?
Or did she simply want to give him a scare?
Ipso facto, this is a classic case of...
- Diminished capacity... - A class struggle...
- An accident... - Automatism...
- Um, where's Gina? - Gina's one of them while Mr. Kaufman represents the wealthy and out of touch.
Attempted murder, therefore, is a bogus, inaccurate charge.
We'd-- we don't know where Gina was.
I think not!
I think not, indeed!
Mr. Gibbins?
Right.
So, the way I see it is...
We say it was self-defense.
And we do that because,
Well, Gina was suffering from stockholm syndrome, which is actually quite common in assistants with demanding bosses.
The affair was just one example of how far Mr. Kaufman's brainwashing of Gina went.
He made her fall in love with him.
So in this way, her poisoning him was an act of self-defense.
And I'll just go stand over there.
No. Sit.
Congratulations to those who managed to keep your seat.
That said, none of you beat my approach, which goes as follows.
Step 1... discredit the witnesses.
Step 2, introduce a new suspect.
That person is Mr. Kaufman's jealous business partner,
Lionel Bryant.
Step 3, we bury the evidence.
We throw so much information at the jury that they walk into the deliberation room with one overwhelming feeling -- doubt.
That's how you get away with murder.
See you in the courthouse at 9:00.
Oh, um, Professor Keating!
We have Torts at 9:00 tomorrow, then Property at 11:00,
- So I'm not sure -- - The way you're whining right now makes me believe you think I'm your mother, Ms. Pratt.
Show up tomorrow or drop out of the competition.
It's that simple.
I was his first assistant for 21 years, so to see him on his office floor like that, it was so awful.
He wasn't breathing.
And his skin kept getting more and more blue.
I'm sorry, Agnes.
I tried everything.
You did everything you could, Ms. Tanner.
We just got screwed. Not in a good way.
You don't like Gina, do you?
You would yell at her, calling her...
"Incompetent," "Stupid," "Podunk trailer trash"?
No. That's a...
Can I have a moment, Your Honor?
What the hell are you doing?
Well, now we know who's the first to flame out.
Hurry it along, Ms. Keating.
What was that?
Something they taught you in Torts?
You should really pay attention.
You might learn something.
Ms. Tanner, you testified that you saw a pill on my client's desk on the day of the accident, correct?
Yes.
And you said it was a yellow pill, similar to Prosecutor Williams' shirt?
Yes.
Prosecutor Williams' shirt is blue, Ms. Tanner.
Are you color-blind?
Yes.
But I know what I saw that morning.
I see.
So whether the pill that you saw on my client's desk was blue, like her anxiety medication she used to endure working under you, or yellow, like the aspirin used to poison Mr. Kaufman, is not something you can tell us?
I told you -- Gina was acting nervous,
- like -- - It's a simple question.
Is it possible that the pill that you saw on gina's desk was her anxiety medication?
I guess so.
Thank you for your candor.
I saw she was wearing glasses in one of her facebook photos, which got me wondering about her eyesight, so I called every optometrist covered under her insurance, found hers, then pretended to be a claims provider to get the receptionist to admit she has a condition called achromatopsia.
It causes color blindness.
Step 1 -- discredit the witness.
I might as well hand you the trophy right now, Ms. Pratt.
But I won't.
Not until I see how the rest of you step up your game.
And in other news, the search continues for Lila Stangard.
Ms. Stangard, a 21-year-old student of the Philadelphia University, has not been seen since friends saw her leaving a fraternity party earlier this week.
Oh, my god.
Hello?
Professor Keating?
Don't even try.
Professor?
Oh, my god.
Get the hell out!
I'm so sorry.
- Th-the door was open. - Oh, I'll kill him.
Why are you here?
It can wait.
Frank, you didn't lock up again.
Speak.
I-I-I came across this case --
Commonwealth v. McGinnis -- which says we can move for a faster verdict if we think the prosecution's evidence is insufficient.
What you're suggesting is called a "Directed Verdict."
If we ask for it and get denied, all the public will hear is there's enough evidence to convict.
But you discredited the first assistant today and --
You had an idea. I'm telling you it's a bad one.
Good night, Seth.
Wes.
Right.
*Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh*
Connor, please stop.
*O'er the fields we go*
*Laughing all the way*
No. I like it, especially that it annoys you.
*What fun it is to ride and sing a slaying song tonight*
*Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way*
What's all this for?
I figured I should buy other stuff in case
I'm on the surveillance video.
Why? We can just kill the store owner if we need to, right?
*Hey!*
*Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way*
*Oh, what fun to kill someone and end up in jail*
Maker's manhattan, two cherries.
So, you know, your co-workers seem to want a show.
So just say the word and we can start making out.
Ignore them.
I-I just -- I don't talk to guys at bars that often.
So, let me guess.
You guys all work in the advertising agency upstairs?
Is it that obvious?
I work in the bank across the street, and the only hot guys that ever come in here are from your agency.
Hot?
I don't work in the cool part of the company, if that's what you're thinking.
I'm in I.T.
I.T.?
No, I-I think I.T.'s very cool.
- Can I ask you something? - Yeah.
Did you know that secretary that tried to kill her boss with an aspirin?
The legal department warned us not to talk about that.
Right.
Sorry I asked.
Uh, okay, but no one can know I told you this.
How'd you get this?
I thought -- I thought all you wanted from me were those e-mails.
I did. But I want this, too.
Turn over.
It wasn't exactly legal, is the point.
Then we just have to get creative.
Bonnie!
Mr. Bryant, you and your business partner, Mr. Kaufman, had a meeting in his office on the morning of the accident, correct?
Yes. To discuss moving Gina to accounting.
So to avoid any possible sexual-harassment lawsuit?
That's correct.
Will you please read this e-mail that you wrote to Mr. Kaufman?
"Dear Arthur, consider this my official request
"that you step down as C.E.O.
"I've warned you about having sexual relations
"with employees of this company --"
Your honor, this e-mail was not part of the discovery file.
- Is this true? - I thought it was.
Although my associate is more familiar with the paperwork on this case.
- Bonnie? - Oh, my god.
- I found the e-mail in the files given to us - What? by our client's previous attorney, your honor.
I just assumed it was part of the discovery file.
It wasn't, which means it was obviously obtained illegally.
Enough.
Did you write this e-mail, Mr. Bryant?
Yes.
Then I have to side with the defense here.
- The e-mail's admissible. - Your honor!
I've made my decision, Mr. Williams.
Mr. Bryant, as stated in the e-mail, you were angry at Mr. Kaufman for taking part in a sexual relationship with an employee.
I was frustrated, yes.
So frustrated that perhaps you swapped his blood-pressure pill for an aspirin in order to gain sole ownership of the company?
- Objection! - Withdrawn.
No further questions.
We did well today,
No doubt due to Mr. Walsh's hard work last night.
I'll be at the Dean's cocktail party if you find anything before tomorrow.
How'd you get that e-mail?
Yeah, bro, for reals.
I don't kiss and tell.
What the hell does that mean?
Where are you going? Where are you going?
Arthur.
Don't -- don't go!
It's just the restroom, sweetie.
- Don't go. Don't go. - It's just the restroom, sweetie.
Shh, shh, shh. I'll be right back.
It's about the both of us. Don't you get that?
Griffin, stop!
This happened, so get your head out of your ass!
Stop yelling!
Do you need help?
It's fine.
It's not a big deal.
Get out of my apartment!
First year is the worst, no doubt.
Just put your head down, do the work, and try not to take it so seriously.
Okay, no offense, man, but, obviously, you never went to law school.
This place is a dogfight 24/7.
And only the big dog get the bone.
Fine. You're on to me.
I'm a psychology professor.
But before you lose all respect for me, you should know that I work with the firm sometimes.
And you? You are?
Wes. He's in your wife's class, too.
Ah. Sam.
How's it going so far?
Has she gone full terrorist on you yet or no?
I'm sorry. Who's your wife?
Professor Keating.
There she is.
Let me guess -- your ears were burning?
- Should they be? - Don't worry.
I didn't spill any secrets.
Well, not yet, at least.
To first year.
They're totally wondering where we went right now.
No way.
Over here.
Flashlight.
Jen cannot find out about this, okay?
- Deal. - Okay.
What was that?
Hey! Who's there?
Can we go?
Why is Frank calling you?
What?
I saw your phone, Laurel.
What the hell's going on?
I only saw them together for a second, I know,
But -- well, it makes sense a wife gets so tired of her husband cheating that she teams up with his mistress for revenge.
Fine. Say you're right.
What do you expect us to do about it?
Put you on the stand so the jury definitely has enough evidence
- to convict Gina? - No. Obviously not.
I-I just...
You already knew.
I didn't say that.
Right.
Because then you'd actually be admitting, out loud, to defending a guilty client.
And who really has time to deal with the moral repercussions of that?
Brown, right?
Or was it Smith? Berkeley?
Brown.
What? You read my application or something?
Just a guess. We get a lot of you around here.
Smart, idealistic girls who come to law school to help the less fortunate.
Only to take a corporate job after graduation, which they then quit the second they get pregnant
'cause they'd rather stay home.
For the child, of course.
You're a misogynistic ass.
Stop...screwing... the students.
I'm not going to say anything.
Honestly, the fact that I even saw that was my --
Stop.
I need to apologize.
My husband and I have been talking about having a baby for a long time now.
And I hate making excuses, but it's put a lot of pressure on us and our marriage.
Oh, my god.
Oh, god, I just...
I'm totally making -- making it worse.
Forgive me.
Thank you for keeping this between us. Hmm?
Of course.
I'll just...
...go.
If Lila were here,
I know she'd want to thank everyone for their support.
That was star Middleton quarterback Griffin O'Reilly speaking tonight at a vigil held for his girlfriend, Lila Stangard.
Sam!
- Hey, guys. - Hey.
Hey.
How was Yale?
Let me guess -- they loved you, right?
Offered you the whole department?
They're just early talks.
No one's moving anywhere yet.
All right. I'm heading to bed. You coming?
I've missed you.
I'll be up soon.
Uh, that's just to say sorry for tonight and then the night before that.
I stole it from the bar I work at, so don't actually think I'm that nice.
I've heard the music you listen to.
I never thought you were nice.
Rebecca.
Should we open it, maybe?
I kind of had a weird night.
Could use a drink... or ten.
I can't tonight.
Sorry.
So, you got the footage from the convenience store when, Detective Gill?
It was two nights ago.
Uh, th-the store owner had seen the defendant's picture on the news, so he went through his old surveillance tapes and just found this footage.
Footage that I will now play for everyone.
There.
The night before the murder attempt,
Ms. Sadowski bought...
What does it say on that label, Detective Gill?
Uh, uh, Soloxacore.
It's a brand of aspirin.
You had one job!
To let us know what bodies we needed to bury!
Texts, calls, anything we needed to destroy.
And you didn't. So guess what!
Guess what!
You go to jail, and I'm the shoddy lawyer who put you there!
I had a headache! It isn't --
Stop lying!
Get out.
I can't think with you here.
She's not wrong, annalise.
It's aspirin. We all buy it.
What about you, frank?
What slutty undergrad spread her legs and made you forget your job this time?!
Hey, I grilled Gina the minute we got this case.
She chose not to tell me this because, well, that's obvious, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
But don't worry. We can fix this.
"We"? No, I'll fix it.
You stay here, collect a paycheck.
I'd like to call our first witness to the stand.
Detective Nate Lahey.
Who's that?
No idea.
Professor.
Get the hell out!
What the hell is this?
Where were you two nights ago, Detective?
What?
Two nights ago, when Detective Gill acquired the video that supposedly incriminates my client --
Weren't you supposed to be working at the precinct as his direct supervisor?
I was.
And were you there?
Please answer the question, Detective.
No.
I was not.
Where were you, then?
Home, perhaps?
Taking care of your wife?
I hear she's recently been diagnosed with cancer.
I was at a friend's.
Okay.
I only ask because there's something I find strange about the chain of custody on this video.
Detective Gill testified that he received the video from the store owner at 8:00 p.m.
But the logs say he didn't log it into custody until 2:09 a.m.
Don't you find that time gap odd?
Sometimes it takes us a while to log evidence into the computer.
Because you're all so busy?
Visiting friends and such?
Detective, in your 12 years working for the city of Philadelphia,
Have you ever known them to alter video footage to help the prosecution get a conviction?
- Objection! - Digitally altering aspirin labels, for example?
- Your Honor! - I'm simply asking
Detective Lahey about his personal experience within his department.
This is the last question I'll allow.
Are you personally aware of any instances of doctored surveillance footage within your department?
Yes.
I am.
The good people of Philadelphia saw justice prevail today.
Ms. Sadowski was a victim here, scapegoated by a desperate, overworked D.A.'s office.
And as much as we hope the police find the real perpetrator of this act against Mr. Kaufman,
Ms. Sadowski is and always has been innocent, and I am so happy the jury agreed.
I want to be her.
Now it's time to find out who will be joining us in our firm.
First, the standout in the class and the one you should all make it your mission to destroy...
Come get your prize, Mr. Walsh.
The other ones joining us will be...
Asher Millstone.
Yeah! Yes!
Michaela Pratt.
Oh, thank God.
Laurel Castillo.
And because our workload has grown,
I decided to hire one more of you.
And that one will be...
Wes Gibbins.
Professor Keating!
Wes. How can I help you?
So, that detective...?
Is my boyfriend. Yes.
I don't want the job.
Not if you picked me because of that.
"That"?
You got him to lie on the stand.
Is that why I picked you?
Because I thought I picked you because your self-defense argument showed you think well on your feet.
But now that you exposed what you really think of yourself and that you really don't believe you deserve this job --
That's not what I said.
That's exactly what you said, right before you accused me of illegal acts to win this case.
We won because I did my job.
You think carefully.
Everything after this moment will not only determine your career but life.
You can spend it in a corporate office drafting contracts and hitting on chubby paralegals before finally putting a gun in your mouth, or you can join my firm and become someone you actually like.
So decide.
Do you want the job or not?
Someone call about low water pressure?
Guys! Did anybody call maintenance?
I think the water thingy's upstairs.
Breaking news live here in Philadelphia --
Police are confirming a woman's body was found inside the Kappa Kappa Theta house on Middleton's campus.
Griffin!
Look!
Whether that woman is Lila Stangard, long-term girlfriend to Middleton football star
Griffin O'Reilly, has not been confirmed.
It was just days ago the star student Stangard was reported missing by one of her friends at the sorority.
She was last seen attending a party at a campus fraternity.
No witnesses saw her leave, and she was not in her room the next morning.
The fact that she might not have been missing this entire time... but rather deceased in her own home...
What happened?
{\an8}is certainly going to raise many questions...
My student.
They found her in one of those water tanks. parked outside the home of her parents,
Stuart and Miranda Stangard, owners of billion-dollar tech company Stangard Industries.
I'm sorry.
No, it's just... those poor parents.
I bet you the boyfriend did it.
I guess we'll see.
Okay. Last chance.
Either we all agree, or we stop right now.
Just do it.
Before the bonfire ends.
Michaela?
It's the only way to destroy the DNA.

## S01E2

Every year, I choose four  students to come work for me.
The top student gets this.
Previously on "How to get Away
with Murder"...
- Oh, my God. 
- Get the hell out.
Wes. He's in your wife's class, too.
I'm sorry. Who's your wife?
Professor Keating.
There she is.
Rebecca, I kind of had a weird night.
- Could use a drink. 
- Sorry.
Police are confirming a woman's
 body was found on middleton's campus.
I bet you the boyfriend did it.
- Either we all agree or we stop right now.
- Just do it.
It's the only way to destroy the DNA.
He should be here by now.
- It's fine. 
- What if it's not?
Michaela.
What if they got caught or went to the police or she convinced him to pin it on us?
Wes wouldn't do that.
He wouldn't, but she would.
Stop, okay? It's going to be fine.
No, think about it.
How we got here... It's all her fault.
It's not her fault. We're all to blame.
- No, I'm gonna call Aiden. 
- Michaela!
No, I never agreed to this!
Because you had a meltdown!
You could barely form a sentence.
So shut up, sit down, and stop acting like a little bitch baby.
Do not tell me how to feel right now!
Hey! Aah!
Sorry it took so long.
I went back for this.
Nothing new?
Doesn't look like it.
Makes sense.
All the time her body was in that water tank probably destroyed any evidence.
I'm gonna be home late.
Dean jovich wants me at the meeting about how to handle the grief counseling.
Really? Because you knew her?
Because he wants someone there from the psych department.
Mm.
But who knows?
Maybe that's part of it, too.
I've got class.
The question I'm asked most often as a defense attorney is whether I can tell if my clients are innocent or guilty.
And my answer is always the same.
I don't care.
And it's not because I'm heartless, although that's up for debate, but because my clients, like all of us here in this room, lie.
And that makes them unknowable.
Take Mr. Millstone, here.
Are you really who you say you are, or are there other sordid details that we're missing?
Criminal record, divorce, an actual skeleton in your closet?
I can assure you I've, uh,
I've never hurt a fly.
So you say.
Look around you.
At the quiet girl you share notes with, the cute guy you have a crush on, the gunner who talks too much in class, and ask yourselves, do you know who anyone really is?
Your instincts better be good, or you'll find yourself choosing the wrong people to make a study group with, to sleep with, or even marry.
Just ask Marjorie St. Vincent, heir to her family's billion-dollar department-store fortune until she was stabbed 16 times in the master bedroom of her gladwyne mansion.
The alleged killer...
Her husband, of course.
Max St. Vincent.
I met Marjorie in Paris.
I was shopping for my daughter
Eloise's fourth birthday.
My wife had just passed.
I needed something  special.
When Marjorie saw me struggling to speak to the owner in French, well, from the minute she opened her mouth to translate,
I knew this was the woman for me.
And 20 years later, she's still the only woman who knew how to make me happy.
Well, as much as anybody can be happy in an institution as barbaric as a marriage.
Don't you agree, Ms. Keating?
Let's keep it moving.
I asked Max to preserve the crime scene until after the trial was over.
You never know what forensic clues you'll find to help our case later.
And the room needed some color, anyway.
You gonna throw up?
No. I'm good.
Look around, take photos, be the fresh eyes we need to help this case.
- Is it time?
- I think it is.
I need a volunteer.
Ladies?
I'll do it.
Very well.
You're about as pretty as my wife was.
Yeah.
Now...
On the bed.
The forensic report claims that Marjorie was in bed reading when I joined her with, uh... ah!
Your pen, dear. Pen.
The knife, which I hid, like this.
Then I pretended to initiate sexual relations.
And just as we were about to kiss...
I struck.
But missed, hitting the carotid artery, which was now squirting like a loose fire hose, hence the walls, so then I struck again, number two.
Hit here.
Followed by number three, here.
Number four, five, six, seven.
16.
Sheesh.
Or so that's the prosecution's theory.
Theory?
Good luck proving that, huh?
The murder book, given to us by the prosecution with all the evidence they've gathered in Max's case.
Go through it.
Find the holes to help get our guy a
"not guilty."
Max said there were three officers at the scene, but only two were on the report.
We need the originals.
I was thinking we send the puppy.
Smart.
Mr. Gibbons, my office... now.
- What do we think is going on there?
- What do you mean?
We all earned our spot here, right?
But wait list?
Don't call him that.
Maybe he's her secret baby, like she gave him up for adoption and he doesn't even know.
Because all black people are related.
What? No. I-I wasn't...
My point is, something is going on.
Otherwise, why would he be here?
Why are any of you here?
That's the question I'm still asking myself.
Frank says that you're having second thoughts about the job.
And what Frank thinks, I usually agree with.
So...
Is he right?
Are you regretting your decision to join us?
No.
I'm happy to be here.
Good.
Let's give you more responsibility, then.
Go to this police department and get the supplemental arrest report for Mr. St. Vincent.
Don't give your name or mine.
You think you could handle that?
Yes.
Thank you.
Now get out.
I just need the supplemental arrest report on Max St. Vincent.
Are you flipping kidding me?
- What? 
- Of course you're not.
Lucinda teaches you this when you start working for her, right?
That the rest of us only exist to serve the DA's office?
DA's office?
It's like that woman looks for ways to waste my time.
You can tell that to Lucinda, okay?
Sure.
The dumb strippers upstairs must have flushed their drugs down the toilet, because now there's disgustingness coming out of my shower drain.
Can I use yours?
- Uh...
- I'll just be a minute.
I can't sleep till I've washed all the beer and frat-boy stench off of me.
Right.
Wow. No offense.
I think I liked Rudy's setup better.
Uh, Rudy?
Yeah, he's the freak who lived here before you.
You actually kind of remind me of him.
Probably because you both have that  crazed look on your face all the time.
It's probably a law-school thing, right?
I guess.
Uh...
I should get back to this work.
Shut up! Shut up!
It's two against two.
We have no other choice. We flip a coin.
That is the dumbest thing you've ever said.
I'm not letting a freaking coin decide whether or not I go to jail tonight!
We don't have time to fight!
We need to make a decision and commit to it.
So if someone has a better idea, say it now!
Heads, we get the body.
Tails, we leave it where it is. Okay?
Heads.
We go back for the body.
Let's go!
 Breaking news on the lila stangard murder here.
Police just released the medical examiner's ruling
that Ms. Stangard's death was indeed a homicide.
This comes a week after she was discovered deceased
in a water tank at her sorority
house, Kappa Kappa Theta.
Want to know the best part about that?
'Cause corpses crap themselves.
So the sorority girls were all drinking their friend's poop.
- Hey, is Professor Keating in? 
- Shh.
No suspects have been announced,
but we do know police spent the morning
interviewing her boyfriend,
Griffin O'Reilly,
a star of the Middleton football team.
Get out of my apartment!
Mr. Gibbons. Did you do what I asked?
Uh, yes.
Well done. Did you look inside?
I-I did, but I actually found a discrepancy between what the supplemental report says versus what's in the prosecution's murder book.
- What kind of discrepancy? 
- A name.
The murder book says the hunting knife was found on the front lawn by officer Jake...
Dorsey. Jake Dorsey.
Really?
So you're not officer Chad Mullens?
Your honor, I'm not sure what
Ms. Keating is insinuating here...
I'm not insinuating anything.
I'm just reading from the supplemental arrest report, which says that officer mullens found the hunting knife, not our witness here.
Or am I misreading the name, officer Dorsey?
Uh... no.
Says officer Mullens.
An officer who I recently found out is under investigation for drinking on the job, which explains why your boss might want to keep his name off of the official arrest report, maybe even changing his name for yours.
Your honor, can we take a recess?
After we get the knife thrown out, we attack the motive.
- Any thoughts?
- I had one.
Prosecution's going to use Marjorie's best friend to say that she wanted to divorce Max, which would have eliminated his inheritance per the prenup and thereby giving him motive to kill.
I looked into discrediting the friend, but I couldn't find anything just yet.
I can make that happen. Why don't I help?
You know, usually I require dinner before I agree to illegally hack into a rich old lady's computer.
- Wednesday. 
- What?
Dinner. You and me.
And the faster you type, the faster you get your reward.
Mrs. Taylor.
You claim that your best friend Marjorie spoke to you about divorcing Max nearly a year ago.
Yes.
Even though you wrote the following toast at their anniversary party about two months ago.
"I haven't seen two people more in love
"since the Captain and Maria performed their first dance in front of the Von trapp children."
Doesn't sound like a couple about to divorce to me.
How in the hell do you find this crap?
You'll never know.
The alibi's next.
Max claims he was out for a walk when the murder occurred, so we need a neighbor who saw him.
Frank... Take who you need.
You two... Prom queen and doucheface.
Come with me.
This is you hazing us, right?
You don't seriously dig through strangers' trash on a normal basis.
You want a desk job, go to a corporate firm.
Now get in there and find us a winner.
Boo-yah!
This is a receipt from risquÃ© business.
That is a strip club, and it is down on...
Caster Ave., yeah.
This is good.
I doubt dad will want mom to find out about where he's spending the kids' tuition.
It was around 8:30 when I took out the trash that night.
Right after our nightly family dinner.
And what did you see while you were outside?
A man walking on the other side of the street.
And did you recognize the man?
Well, it was very dark that night, but I think it's very possible that it was my neighbor,
Mr. St. Vincent.
The prosecution has rested, so the first witness to take the stand will be Max's daughter.
I need someone to write up the prep questions.
I'll do it.
Frank's girl. Good.
Have them on my desk by midnight.
I'll meet you back at the house.
Let me guess.
You were sent to tell me to stop embarrassing cops on the stand.
You need to be careful.
There's gonna be pushback.
Is that a threat?
Not from me.
You haven't returned my calls.
I'm not here to talk about us.
- So that's it? We're done? 
- Are you surprised?
You know I never set out to hurt you on purpose.
You blackmailed me on the stand, made me sell out my department.
I'll be lucky if the Chief gives me another case all year.
I'll talk to him.
You're the last person I want talking for me right now.
Now, I'm trying to make things right.
Don't you want me to make things right?
I'm done with your crazy.
- Nate. 
- What do you want from me?
You won your case, got laid.
So how else can I be of service to you?
You call me again, and I swear to God
I'll tell your husband every dirty, nasty thing
I did to you under his own roof.
Is that all for you?
Room 203, please.
It's me. Don't worry. It's a new phone.
I know, but I just wanted to tell you we're taking care of it.
They didn't want to at first, but I got them to come around.
We're gonna protect you.
Sam?
I'll be out in a minute.
- Have you eaten yet?
- No.
How about that Indian place?
They take forever to deliver, but I'll pick it up if you want to call.
Annie?
Everything okay?
Yeah. Indian sounds good.
Okay.
Great.
Well, look at us.
You on your way home from work and me on my way there.
Ships in the night.
Uh, hey, uh, so I saw your friend on the news...
The football player, about his girlfriend, Lila Stangard.
And?
I just wanted to say sorry...
- If she was your friend, too.
- She wasn't.
You a cop or something?
The news said the cops were questioning him.
I just wanted to make sure you knew don't ever talk to them without a lawyer.
Yeah. I know.
I'm not an idiot, and you're not a lawyer.
You're making me late.
These are the prep questions for the daughter.
Great.
What?
I thought about what you said, why, uh, why any of us are here, and I know now that Connor and Michaela were both top of their class,
Asher, he's got his father, and Wes, I don't know, but it seems like Annalise likes him.
A lot.
And me
It's, uh, Frank, right?
I mean, he picked me, not Professor Keating.
I look nice, I know, but that's just my face.
And you coming to me with your questions and personal drama is not going to make me nicer.
So rather than me tell you the answer to what you just asked, let me just say that the time you are wasting worrying about Frank is time you should be using getting Annalise to actually learn your name.
I'm done talking to you.
Can you trust your character witness on the stand?
That is one of the biggest dilemmas as a defense attorney.
Your character witness is too positive, the jury feels manipulated.
Too honest, and you shot your case in the foot.
Which is why it all comes down to pretrial prep.
Team.
I'd like you to meet my daughter, Eloise.
She's fresh off the plane from Stanford.
She dropped everything the minute we said we needed her.
I'm getting a master's in poetry.
There's not much to drop.
Mm, Ellie.
- He's the one I mentioned in the car.
- Dad.
Think of the beautiful babies you two would make.
The challenge is in establishing your witness's credibility.
You have to show them being real, even critical of your client.
He's your father.
Are we really supposed to believe that you wouldn't lie for him on the stand?
I love my father, obviously, but I also love Marjorie.
If my father hurt her,
I'd insist you give him the death penalty.
See? Pretty and smart.
Be as punishing as possible.
No topic is off limits.
What about when he sent you to the mental institution?
He told you you were crazy, right?
I was 15 and anorexic, just like every other girl at my private school.
And I got better.
Because you were able to get away from his bad parenting?
He wasn't a bad parent.
He's odd, yes, eccentric, but it's just a defense mechanism.
His parents died when he was a child.
His first wife, my birth mother, died in a car accident when I was 3.
That changes you.
Makes you scared of losing people.
That's why he clung to Marjorie and me.
We were his entire world.
Which is how I know there's no way he could have hurt her.
I get that's hard to believe coming from me, but it's the truth.
Your witness.
Your father met Marjorie after your  first mother died in Switzerland.
- Is that correct?
- Yes.
What if I told you that was a lie?
That your father and Marjorie were having an affair.
No, my mother died before they met.
In a car accident.
Or at least that's what your father told you.
Your honor, if the prosecutor  wants to testify, swear her in.
The state would like to introduce the certified Swiss death report for Mr. St. Vincent's first wife,
Elizabeth Sims.
It's been translated so Ms. St. Vincent can read it for the jury.
"Elizabeth sims died at age 28
"from a deeply incised wound of the upper neck in the manner of homicide."
And the murder weapon?
A hunting knife.
"Stuart sims was put on trial in glattbrugg, Switzerland,
"for the murder of his wife, Elizabeth.
"The prosecution argued his motive
"was to run away with his mistress, Marjorie Trask,
"but Stuart was found not guilty.
"The following year,
"he created a new identity for him and his daughter
"as Max and Eloise St. Vincent, then settled in Philadelphia with Marjorie for a fresh fake start."
Charming.
I was trying to protect you.
By lying to me about my entire life?
How do you tell a young girl her mother's been butchered to death?
- What good would that do?
- Because you did it, right?
And now Marjorie, too?
Don't be ridiculous.
You killed the both of them.
- You're a murderer and a liar. 
- Ellie, please.
Do not come near me.
I hope the jury decides to kill you.
I kind of agree with her, yo.
Hello, Stuart.
So, would you have taken my case had I told you?
You underestimate how much I like a challenge.
You lie to me again, you no longer have an attorney.
Frank, find out how the prosecution knew about Max's first trial.
Whoever slipped the information could be a possible suspect.
- On it.
- And the rest of you, prove I wasn't wrong to hire you.
I forgot. I'm sorry.
My boss called us into work last minute, and I'll take you to dinner this weekend instead.
Hello?
Oliver?
Boyfriend drama?
I don't do boyfriends.
Wait, you're gay?
Hey, Bon. Is she in there?
Yeah.
Sam. About your student...
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Thanks.
It's been a little rough, to be honest.
Oh, I didn't hear you come home.
Hey. I just walked in.
Rework this motion to suppress.
How did court go?
Wow. That well?
My client's a liar.
Is there something you want to ask me?
This isn't your courtroom, Annie.
You have something to say, say it.
- Were you screwing her?
- No.
- You sure about that?
- I said no!
Absolutely not.
Do your work.
Good eye contact.
Now you're just being belligerent.
You're surprised?
That my wife thinks that I slept with one my students?
Well, she is pretty.
Sorry. Was.
Oh, God. Listen to yourself.
You're acting crazy.
Well, shouldn't I be? It's happened before!
Come here.
Look at me.
Annie, look at me.
There was nothing going on with me and that girl.
I swear to God.
I'm sorry.
It's... it's just this case, this client.
I'm gonna lose.
You say that every time.
Come in.
You need to see this.
I'll leave you guys to it.
There's only one way to win this case.
We prove that Max, even if he did kill his first wife, didn't kill Marjorie.
Use this room, look for clues that we missed, evidence that contradicts...
Just get inside the murderer's head.
We can swipe the room for DNA again and see if we can find another suspect.
We already ran more tests.
Did you not fully read up on the case?
Let's put Max on the stand and have him cry like a little baby.
Argue the matrix defense.
Sleepwalking defense.
Battered husband syndrome.
Bipolar mood swings.
He's a hunter.
An msg massacre defense.
- He's a hunter!
- Yeah, genius.
I think the heads on the wall make that pretty obvious.
No.
He's a hunter. He knows how to kill.
You've been hunting for approximately how many years,
Mr. St. Vincent?
Oh, practically my whole life.
So, you're experienced at slaughtering animals, then?
Yes, it's one of the first things my father taught me...
How to be humane, to minimize suffering.
- And there are ways to ensure that? 
- Oh, yes.
I could show you right now, if you like.
Please.
First, you bend the neck like this so the chin is close to the chest.
Then you put the knife here...
Ms. Keating.
Please explain the relevance of this.
It'll become apparent, your honor.
Continue.
Once the knife is by the jugular, you slice...
In one swift motion, and then, well, it just becomes about waiting for the stillness, which happens quite fast if you've done it correctly.
And this technique... This very humane, painless way of killing an animal...
Is that how you murdered your first wife?
Yes, that's correct.
She's given her client bad advice in order to get a mistrial.
Who says it's bad advice?
My client was acquitted of the first murder.
In Switzerland.
Double jeopardy still stands, and if you'd just let me present my next witness, your honor, you'll see the relevance of all of this.
Really?
There's actual relevance to the things you do?
How many years have you been chief medical examiner of the city of Philadelphia?
13 years. I left last may to become chief of pathology at penn state.
And you've studied the autopsy reports
- of both Elizabeth sims and
Marjorie St. Vincent. - Yes.
Can you describe the difference between the two murders?
Well, at first blush, they look quite similar.
But a more in-depth review of the reports indicates that the first murder, a laceration across the neck, was done by someone with a knowledge of anatomy.
And the second murder?
The numerous sharp injuries were messy, inaccurate.
They hit bone.
The killer clearly knew nothing about anatomy.
Meaning the second killer probably did not have hunting experience.
Definitely not.
In fact, it is my expert opinion that there's no way that these two women were killed by the same person.
The defense rests.
I think I know who the second murderer was.
- Oh?
- Eloise.
The supplemental arrest report said there was no forced entry.
Who else would have a key?
So maybe she found out the truth before we did...
That Max killed her mother, then stabbed Marjorie to frame him.
Interesting theory.
You need to see this.
I got the I.P. address of the computer that e-mailed the DA about Max's first trial.
Came from a Stanford computer lab.
Eloise.
She spent spring break visiting her mom's hometown in Switzerland, dug up the real story how she died, started plotting her revenge.
Like father, like daughter.
But what if it's true?
We've rested our case, Mr. Gibbons.
Now we wait for the verdict.
Laurel.
Speak up more. I like your ideas.
And watch out for Mr. Gibbons and Miss Castillo here.
Quiet ones are usually the most dangerous.
What the hell just happened?
Told you I had good taste.
We're not having this conversation again.
I'm not gonna do anything.
Besides, you're the one  we need to worry about.
What?
You think you're the only one in that house who notices things?
Have you reached a verdict?
We have, your honor.
In the matter of commonwealth vs. St. Vincent, case number P1082971, we, the jury, find the defendant, Maxwell St. Vincent...
Not guilty.
You got away with murder, you pig!
Okay, I don't like this part.
You know, there was an easier way to do this.
You mean throw her to the wolves?
You obviously don't have any children.
She killed your wife, a woman that you apparently loved.
And I'll find a way to punish Ellie for that.
Don't you worry.
You think I mean kill her?
No, Ms. Keating.
I'd rather not spend my entire inheritance paying your legal bills.
Well, I shouldn't make any promises.
Now is not a good time.
No, it's okay.
No. I don't care what your boss needs.
I'm not here for work. I'm here for dinner.
You really think I'm that desperate?
That you can buy me some takeout and bat your eyes and I'll get down on my knees like some sad twink.
You're too old to be a twink.
Okay.
But tonight, I do you.
Sam?
In here.
What's this all about?
We are celebrating your win, which, let me just say...
You predicted. I know.
Here. Sit.
I'm gonna head to the cellar and get us a bottle.
Don't move.
Annie? Everything okay?
I found a bottle Ted and leah gave us for our 20th.
Where you going?
I have a client who just called me from jail.
I'll be home as soon as I can.
Nia's inside.
- I just need a minute. 
- No.
It's about the Lila Stangard murder.
It's not my case.
I told you... I'm on probation.
I know.
But Sam knew her. She was his student.
They were close.
They were close.
Hey. How'd it go?
Fine. Got him out on a misdemeanor.
Annie.
- Hmm? 
- You sure we're okay?
'Cause if we're not,
I'd rather talk about it.
I promise it won't be as scary as you think.
Annie.
We're good. I promise.
They were close.
- They were close.
- You serious?
You think he had something to do with it?
- I don't know. 
- Why?
Because she was his student?
That's your case?
One of his closest students.
Which means he'd screw her. Yeah.
But kill her?
We're all capable of terrible things, Nate.
This is your job talking.
It's making you see bad where there is none.
But you got to stop, go home, and talk to him.
He told me nothing happened.
- Then there's your answer.
- No, listen, all right?
How many times has nia asked you those same questions, huh?
And what did you tell her about us?
The truth?
He's my husband, Nate... My husband!
Exactly.
You don't do this to your husband...
Sell him out to your boyfriend.
Go home.
I'm not gonna say it again.
Nate!
He was supposed to be at Yale the night she was killed, and I need for you to tell me that he was there, that his alibi checks out.
It's the only way to stop my mind, all right?
To know for sure that he didn't have anything to do with this.
Please, Nate. All right?
I don't know who else to go to.
I wish it were someone else, but it's you.
I need you.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Annalise.
Be careful.
Get off me! Don't... don't touch me!
- You have the right to speak with an attorney. - Get off of me!
- If you cannot afford an attorney...
- You're hurting me!
- One will be appointed to you at no charge.
- Stop it!
Let go, let go, let go of me!
Rebecca!
Don't say anything!
 The two suspects, Griffin
O'Reilly and Rebecca Sutter,
were arrested within an hour of each other.
The female suspect, Ms. Sutter,
worked at an off-campus bar,
rumored to be the place Middleton  students go to buy drugs.
In fact, a just-released
arrest record on Ms. Sutter
shows a history of drug charges,
including the sale of hardcore narcotics...
Cocaine, heroin, and meth.
It's me.
Room 203, please.
- It's all her fault. 
-It's not her fault.
Wes wouldn't do that.
He wouldn't, but she would.
We're gonna protect you.
Rebecca. What took you so long?!
I'm sorry, but it's done.
It's done.
Okay.
Don't you ever leave me like that again.
I won't.
I'm here now.
I'm not going anywhere.
You're safe now.
You're safe. sync and corrections by <font color="##FF0000">dreaMaker7</font> www.addic7ed.com

"How to Get Away with Murder"...
Every year I choose four students to come work for me.
The top student gets this.
Come get your prize, Mr. Walsh.
My wife thinks I slept with one my students?
It's happened before!
There was nothing going on with me and that girl.
It's about the Lila Stangard murder.
Sam knew her.
He was supposed to be at Yale the night she was killed, and I need for you to tell me
- that his alibi checks out. 
- Okay.
You're hurting me!
Rebecca! Don't say anything!
Heads, we get the body.
Tails, we leave it where it is.
It's the only way to destroy the DNA.
Rebecca, it's done. You're safe now.
Michaela, stand up.
We need to leave. Do you understand?
Michaela!
Connor, stop!
Michaela, we need to leave now.
Michaela. Look at me.
Everything's gonna be okay.
She's not fine. Are you blind?
Her little perfect brain can't handle this.
Can you hear me?
Michaela?
Ooh.
Why don't I quit my job, move to Philly, and I can be your trophy wife?
Because I'm not marrying a loser.
Well, I'd still be me.
I'd just have, you know, more time on my hands so I can cook us dinner...
And I can take care of the kids.
Ah. "Kid." One. Mm.
And... the nanny will take care of it.
And the chef will cook us dinner.
And you and I will take over the world.
Oh.
- Ohh. 
- What? What is it?
I have to get to the office.
We're picking up a new client at the jail.
I just got here. Come on.
Professor Keating doesn't care.
All right, well, at least let me walk you to the office.
What am I, 10 years old?
Do you not watch the news?
Students are getting murdered out there.
 The two suspects,
Griffin O'Reilly and Rebecca Sutter,
were arrested within an hour of each other.
Hi, I'm looking for information on someone in custody named Rebecca Sutter.
- Press?
- Excuse me?
Are you press or a lawyer?
If you're with the press, piss off.
If you're a lawyer, I need to see I.D.
The female suspect we don't know much about, and, frankly, she's not our concern.
But I think I speak for all of us in the administration when I say we stand behind Griffin O'Reilly and we believe in his innocence.
Thankfully, he posted bail and was released this morning.
He's a great kid, lives a clean life.
Of course, the president's office officially cannot take a position in his trial.
Because the victim's family's donated more than $8 million to the university last year alone.
But, then, having the star quarterback convicted of murder does untold harm to the entire sports program.
Annalise, you and Sam have been great assets to us here, and I think it's fair to say you've received a generous compensation package and unprecedented freedom in conducting your classes with virtually no oversight.
I bring students here as a result.
Yes, we know that.
But we haven't asked for much.
But you're asking now.
We need you to represent Mr. O'Reilly.
I'll think about it.
- It's me.
- I'm on probation.
You can't be calling me.
I know, but the university wants me to represent the football player, and I...
I can't give them an answer until I know about Sam.
I'm in new haven right now, checking his alibi.
I'll call you when I know something.
Hi.
Are you Natalie from the
Yale Psych Department?
Do I know you?
Your co-worker said I'd find you here.
There was a lecture you scheduled a couple weeks ago featuring a Professor up from Philly.
Oh, Dr. Sam Keating, right.
I was wondering if you might have a copy of the lecture on video.
We didn't tape anything that night.
And if we did, it would be pretty dull.
Dr. Keating didn't show.
Really?
He said he had food poisoning, canceled last minute.
Really ticked off Dean Reynolds, too.
She'd been wooing Dr.
Keating for a position here, but after getting blown off like that... sync and corrections by <font color="##FF0000">dreaMaker7</font> www.addic7ed.com
Professor Keating. Hi.
This is my fiancÃ©, Aiden Walker.
He works for the mayor of New York.
Michaela speaks very highly of you.
Don't be late again.
So, she's not exactly warm.
This him, future hubby?
Aiden, meet Asher, Wes, Lauren.
Laurel.
Aiden freakin' Walker.
Connor Walsh?!
Oh, my God!
You two know each other?
Yeah! We... we went to  boarding school together.
So good to see you, man. Huh.
So, this is your fiancÃ©.
Yep. Ah.
Guess we have more in common than I thought.
Officer Nelson.
Hey, that I.T. Guy you know...
You think he'd be able to unlock a phone?
Are you becoming a hacker, Waitlist?
I-I have a friend who forgot his pass code.
Really?
You have a friend?
Look who's here... Professor Keating.
You have a client of mine in lockup...
Paula Murphy.
"Sex in the park" lady. Yeah, she's here.
That's it?
Our hot new case is some hooker in a park?
She's a friend of a friend.
Not every case is a serial killer.
You want to be Professor Keating one day, you build a client base from the ground up, so shut up and learn.
Whoa, that is not a hooker, that's a mom.
Genius.
Mrs. Murphy, I'm Annalise Keating.
Oh, thank God.
I don't know how I'll ever repay you...
- This way.
- I didn't know what to do.
I've never needed a lawyer before.
I was so grateful that Cheryl offered to put me in touch with you.
Well, Cheryl is a long-time client of mine.
I'm glad I can be of some help.
I am so ashamed.
This is not the kind of thing I usually do.
The charges have been dropped.
It's been cleared from your record.
No one will know, including your husband.
- Elena Aguilar, you're under arrest. 
- What?
Excuse me? This is Paula Murphy.
Her name's Elena Aguilar.
She's a fugitive wanted for felony murder in connection with the 1994 bombing of the world financial institute.
Hooker mom turned out to be bomb mom.
I freakin' love this job.
Shh. Her kids are right there.
It makes you wonder what secrets Aiden might be keeping from you, right?
There were five people involved in the bombing in 1994, all members of the anti-globalization group known as the Red Letter Brigade.
Two served time. One passed away.
Their leader, Gabriel Shaw, remains incarcerated, and Elena Aguilar disappeared after posting bail.
And they think Paula is this... Elena?
Their fingerprints match, yes.
Fingerprints that they took because she was caught giving... manual pleasure to a stranger in a park?
Kevin!
Unless you're gonna tell me that this is all a big mistake,
I don't care what you have to say right now.
The evidence against
Paula is quite damning.
It's her fingerprint they found on a fragment of the pipe bomb that exploded and killed a janitor.
He died?
It was meant to go off when no one was around.
You did this?
This is all true?
It's a lot to process,
I know, but we have a decision to make.
The government offered  a plea deal... 10 years.
They need an answer in one hour.
10 years?!
We should take it.
A man died. They have my fingerprints.
It's not that long of a time.
It is a long time.
Your daughters are gonna grow up without you.
It's gonna destroy your family.
I think there's a way that we can win this.
We can win this.
Make sure the daughters are in court.
That's gold for the jury.
- When's the bail hearing?
- Tomorrow morning.
- The forensics expert? 
- On his way.
What can he say to help?
Her fingerprint's on the bomb fragment.
Exactly. There's no way to win this.
You just lost the trophy, Mr. Walsh.
What? You said that we could hand it in whenever we wanted.
That was before you doubted my abilities.
I'm just saying that we have no defense.
Who says I don't have one?
United States v. Hearst...
Who can tell me the facts?
Mr. Gibbins.
Patty hearst, heiress to the hearst corporation, was charged with armed bank robbery.
Her lawyers argued a two-pronged defense...
That she was both brainwashed and coerced by her kidnappers at the symbionese liberation army.
- Did the defense work?
- No.
The prosecution argued that she could not be both under duress and brainwashed.
We were occupy before there was occupy.
Big-bank greed, misdistribution of wealth...
We were against that stuff years ago.
And Paula... or Elena, as you knew her...
She espoused these beliefs, as well?
Hells, yeah.
Elena liked to rage against the  wealth machine as much as any of us.
Who can tell me the first key to a mind-control defense?
Ms. Castillo?
Establishing a brainwasher, a mastermind you can pin the crime on.
Mr. Davis, would you say that you were under the influence of your group's charismatic leader,
Gabriel Shaw?
You make him sound like a cult leader.
Your words, not mine.
Gabriel is very persuasive, but he never made us do anything we didn't want to do.
Really?
Didn't he once keep food from the group for seven straight days?
We were fasting. That was voluntary.
It's called food deprivation, and it's one of the most effective tools in mind control.
And once a ringleader has been identified?
Ms. Pratt.
Establish that the illegal act was conceived wholly and originally by the ringleader, that it was his idea alone.
And this plan to plant the pipe bomb was Gabriel's entirely, wasn't it?
- Objection... hearsay.
- Sustained.
Did he consult you about the plans, ask your opinion? No.
- Did he consult any of the other members of the group? - No.
Nothing further.
For the record, though,
I do think Elena should go to jail.
Motion to strike!
We all served our time. Why shouldn't she?
Your Honor?
Where are we in finding Gabriel?
The feds are hiding him in the prison system.
I was thinking if I drafted a motion for disclosure...
Leave the lawyering to the actual lawyers, Frank.
Just find a way to track him down.
Uh...
Professor Keating, how about if I help Frank with that?
Gabriel Shaw has been in perfect health for the last five years...
That is, until he was  conveniently hospitalized in the allentown federal prison just one day after the
USA interviewed him about this case.
The diagnosis... undetermined.
They're faking sick. It's obvious.
They don't want the jury to hear whatever he has to say.
Where'd you get this from?
I have, uh... sources.
You mean your daddy?
Whoever it was, it worked.
Make room on your mantel  for the trophy, Mr. Millstone.
Yeah.
I spoke to the judge.
We can drive to the prison in the morning, talk to Mr. Shaw.
Paula, I want you to come, persuade him to testify on your behalf.
You mean see him? Gabriel?
Is that a good idea?
He's behind bars. You'll be perfectly safe.
I'm sorry. I'd rather not.
I'm just not comfortable with the idea of seeing him.
To be perfectly Frank, I'm not concerned if you're comfortable or not.
We need his testimony.
Okay, if Frank's not a lawyer, then what is he?
Is he Annalise's bodyguard?
Whatever he is, I'm glad there's some eye candy around here.
What about me? I'm not eye candy enough?
Aiden is eye candy.
You are meatloaf.
Meatloaf that's about to get your trophy.
My trophy.
And I never believed he was a lawyer.
What does that mean?
Have you heard him speak? That accent?
Which means what? He's from Philadelphia?
Or you're a classist elitist who thinks everyone who didn't go to an Ivy is beneath you?
Well, that's just true.
O.M.G., do you have a crush on him? No.
You totally do.
Could someone answer their damn phone?
Wes, it's your bag.
Hello?
Who is this? Where's Lila?
Lila?
You're calling Lila's phone?
Dude gave me her number, said she could hook me up.
Is she there?
Hello?
Heads.
We go back for the body.
Let's go!
No!
No. This makes no sense at all.
We go back for the body, and then what?
We do what with it?
Have any of you thought about that?
We burn it.
Oh, please. A body doesn't just burn.
You need an incinerator.
But at least we'll get rid of our DNA.
And the bonfire will cover the smoke.
It's... it's kind of a perfect plan.
Perfect? The bonfire.
There is nothing perfect about this plan.
You guys...
Cry all you want.
I'm now on board with the plan.
- Listen to me!
- What?!
The bonfire... That's our alibi.
Say "cheese"!
Smile or go to jail!
It's gonna be fine.
Elena Aguilar...
In the flesh.
Hi.
I spent the last 20 years waiting for this day.
And I got to say...
It was worth it.
You look... great.
You don't look so bad yourself.
Yeah, well, don't say that too loud.
There's a lot of lonely guys in here that would like to date me.
Ah, I missed that sound.
Me too.
Mr. Shaw, we're here because Elena is on trial for Felony murder.
If you have anything to offer her defense...
Put me on the stand.
- I'll say whatever you need me to.
- Gabriel, no.
Look, I'm already stuck in this hellhole.
There's no need for you to be, too.
The bomb was all my idea.
Elena didn't know anything about it.
That work?
I'm sorry.
I should not be happy right now.
I know that.
We did a terrible thing.
That poor man died.
We should all pay for that, but we believed in something.
I forgot how that feels, the thrill of it all.
That's what I was looking for in that park with that man.
But it's him.
He's that feeling, and I miss it every day.
Playing dress-up with my girls, having drinks with friends, during sex with Kevin,
I'm never not missing him.
Please don't tell Kevin that I said that.
Annalise, that actually happened?
You just walked out on president Dolan?
And left the fate of our star quarterback hanging in the balance?
Well, I meet with the boy tomorrow.
We'll see what he says.
Well, it's a big case.
There's gonna be a lot of press.
You want to be sure before you take it.
Does that mean you don't think I should take it?
After 20 years, I know better than to give you career advice.
What's going on with Yale, Sam?
Heard anything back?
Actually, I got a phone call this afternoon.
They went with someone from Duke.
Screw 'em. Philly's home, anyway.
Exactly. I, for one, am relieved we get to keep our friends.
He had business at Yale, checked into your hotel a few weeks back.
I just need to find out if the car was parked here every night he was in town.
- But you're not a cop.
-  I'm not a cop.
- What's the name? 
- Sam Keating.
Here we are.
His car was in the lot every night... except here.
Friday, the 29th.
Left the garage at 7:00 P.M., wasn't back till 6:00 the next morning.
Clean up your messes.
What's going on?
While we're waiting for Mr. Shaw to get transferred from prison, we're gonna be meeting with a potential new client.
They'll be here any minute.
Please tell me it's the football player.
I heard a rumor that the university wants Annalise to defend him.
Don't call her "Annalise."
You'll find out soon enough.
There was a party at my fraternity that Friday.
Lila didn't come.
She was pissed at me, and I just wanted a break.
We were drinking a lot, and some of the girls wanted coke, so I called Rebecca.
She was your dealer?
No, she was friends with Lila.
I knew she dealt.
Lila was friends with a drug dealer?
She knew all types of people.
Rebecca came over.
We got really messed up.
Next thing I know,
I'm back in my room with her, our clothes are off, and we're in the middle...
We're in the middle when Lila walked in.
We never did that, Lila and me.
We'd taken a vow, promised each other we'd wait till we got married.
Lila just lost it.
I mean, she's screaming, scratching me.
That's why my DNA is under her nails.
She ran out, and that's when
I see Rebecca... smiling.
I knew then she set the whole thing up.
She texted Lila from my phone when we were hooking up, and she told her that I needed to see her.
I looked for Lila all night.
I called her friends, I went to her room.
I was probably there when she was getting strangled on that roof.
Rebecca did this... not me.
I swear to God.
Sign in.
What is this?
Rebecca, I'm from the Public 
Defender's office.
Thank you.
Tell me you're not actually my lawyer.
I found the phone.
Lila's phone.
There's evidence on the phone, right, something that can prove you're innocent?
Otherwise, why would you keep it?
You have to trust me here.
They're gonna assign you some lame public defender, and right now, your case feels really hard to win.
I might be able to get you other help, but first you have to tell me what's on the phone.
Guard!
What are you doing?
Get him out of here! Get him out!
- Guard! 
- Rebecca, stop!
He's not my lawyer, he's a law student. He lied.
- You need my help! 
- He's stalking me!
Let's go. Let's go.
Griffin's gonna pin it on you!
- Let's go. 
- That's why I came here...
Because he's gonna pin it on you!
Do you need anything else?
See the pile?
Actually, can I help with that tomorrow?
There's this law-review party tonight,
- and we're supposed to...
- Where's it at?
A... Bar.
I think it's called McKoy's.
You guys can come if...
We're not going, and if you wanted to go, you should have just said so from the start.
Just 'cause we got no lives doesn't mean no one else can.
Let her go.
You heard him.
Why apply to law review?
You're already putting in 80-hour weeks.
It'd be crazy to take on more.
To the folks who think that way,
I just want to say...
Grow a pair!
Do you not want multiple job offers?
Do you not want to be president someday?
Hell, yeah! Yes!
You have a gun on you?
I'd just give anything to put this guy out of his misery.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I'm all for gun control...
Except when it comes to d-bags.
- Can I get a "Hell, yeah"?
- Hell, yeah!
There seem to be lot of those around here.
Well, welcome to law review.
I'm Kan.
Laurel.
And you're not really selling me on applying if that's the point of this party.
No, I don't do law review.
I spend my 80 hours a week at legal aid, which means I came here for the free beer...
And to meet smart girls.
Jed Freeman joined the army?
Yeah, he's like a... a corporate lieutenant or something like that. Ah.
It's crazy.
Uh, Connor, do you mind going somewhere else?
This is our last night together.
My bad.
Congrats again on the engagement.
You know, there was a time when I thought that maybe I'd be the one wearing Aiden's ring.
Oh, my God. Connor, will you stop?
Wait, you...
You never told her?
- Come on, dude. 
- What is he talking about?
It's nothing. It's nothing.
- Aiden... 
- Relax. Relax.
We were 16, locked away  at an all-boys boarding school in the middle of freezing New Hampshire.
It's not a big deal.
Shots on me, party people!
Oh, ho, yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Hey, Frank!
Hey, come do a buttery nipple!
You lied.
It was years ago. Hardly anything happened.
Oh, stop! I don't want any  more of a mental picture than I already have!
Look, okay,
I-I didn't tell you about it, all right?
I know.
- But that's different than lying to you.
- Is it?
Because we've talked about all our exes, and you've never mentioned a boy, which feels a lot like lying!
You know me. You know that I don't lie.
I don't believe you.
All right, you know what?
I'm just gonna get the train back tonight.
I think that's a great idea.
Right in there.
She's my next-door neighbor.
Your neighbor was the other suspect in this case, and you didn't think to tell me?!
I don't really know her.
We just live next door, and I...
What?!
You can't defend Griffin!
I saw him fighting with Rebecca.
He's not a good guy like you think.
And he's got everything...
The school, money...
But Rebecca's got nothing.
She's alone, a... a pawn.
And isn't that why you do this...
Defend people... So they get a fair trial?
But that's not gonna happen for her because she's poor.
And I don't think that's  fair or right, and...
If you want to fire me, fine.
But she needs you.
I don't know.
I just wanted to do... Something.
I'm done.
We have an actual client waiting for us in court.
Let's go.
I hooked up with pretty much all the hot guys at boarding school, if it makes you feel better.
Also, I barely remember  what his penis looks like.
Wait. No.
I still do.
Looked like, uh, you and that legal-aid guy were... bonding pretty well last night.
Oh, yeah. We all saw that sloppy make-out.
In fact, I think Frank was so grossed out, he had to leave.
Frank was there?
Dude, looks like you found an even better party  than we did last night, huh?
Huh? Unh!
Mr. Bordal, I understand you have one additional witness.
Yes, your Honor.
The prosecution calls Gabriel Shaw.
What?! I thought he was our witness.
Once he's on the witness list, either side can call him.
Take us back to 1994, Mr. Shaw.
How would you characterize that time and, more specifically, as it relates to Elena Aguilar,
AKA Paula Murphy?
We were fighting the good fight, doing all we could to reverse the rampant greed around us.
I guess that's why I wasn't that surprised when Elena suggested that...
We plant that bomb.
Mr. Shaw, didn't you tell  me before the trial that it was your idea to plant the bomb, not my client's?
- Did I?
- You're lying, Mr. Shaw.
Look, Elena is the woman
I've loved my entire life...
Even all this time in jail.
So, when I saw her the other day...
Well, I would have said  anything to protect her.
But then I came to my senses and decided to tell the truth.
The truth. Exactly.
And the truth is you were not on the prosecution's original witness list.
- Isn't that right?
- It is.
So, it wasn't until you  spoke with the defense that the U.S. attorney convinced you to swap sides?
Objection.
The word "convince" implies that...
I'll rephrase it.
What deal was promised to you if you agreed to testify against my client?
Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence.
Really? So, there was no offer on the table?
He simply volunteered?
Answer the question, Mr. Shaw.
Early release.
Early release.
Wow.
So, after 20 years in prison, you get to walk free.
That must feel amazing.
After 20 years in a cell,
I think I'd say pretty much anything for that.
Your honor... Nothing further.
- You just keep lying to me.
- I'm sorry.
I don't know if y-y-you're upset right now because you're gonna go to jail or because your creepy lover just betrayed you.
Kevin!
The judge has given us three hours.
That's how long we have to rebuild our defense.
Look into forensics, crime tech, the FBI lab.
This moment, right now... this is when you prove your worth.
You worked on the Gabriel Shaw case, right?
Who are you again?
Just writing a research paper for my criminology class at Middleton.
Well, I'm afraid that...
Look  I just need the files for this one case.
It's nearly all public information.
Look, five minutes of your time saves my life.
Please.
Oh, my God.
Yes, I'm looking for Ned Crawford at the allentown prison.
Uh-huh.
Mr. Crawford?
Hi. You don't know me, but my name is Michaela Pratt.
You found something?
I got ahold of the prison logs for Gabriel Shaw, and he received six phone calls from a woman named Jane Santora ever since we took Paula to visit him in prison.
Santora is Paula's mother's maiden name.
Why would she be calling him?
Professor Keating.
Where? No.
Sorry to interrupt, but I found out that...
That is not the right answer, Frank.
We were in the cafeteria, talking...
I thought we were working through it...
When she said she needed to go to the restroom.
That was an hour ago.
Ms. Keating, have you located your client?
I'm afraid her whereabouts  are unknown, Your Honor.
Very well.
I'm issuing a bench warrant for the immediate arrest of Paula Murphy...
AKA Elena Aguilar.
Until she's detained, case H9Y2 is put on permanent hold.
Court adjourned.
Choose your husband carefully, miss Pratt.
You'll only have yourself to blame if it ends badly.
Hi.
There's nothing?
Nothing.
I checked with Yale, the hotel.
He was there the night she was murdered.
Dr. Keating didn't show.
Left the garage at 7:00 P.M., wasn't back till 6:00 the next morning.
His alibi's solid.
You're sure?
He never left, Annalise.
Oh, thank God.
Good night.
Wait.
I've missed you.
Go home.
Be with your husband.
Here.
That's the last one.
Everyone, get in the car.
Wait.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Just... get in the car, Michaela.
Oh, no, m-m-m-m-my ring.
What?
My engagement ring is gone!
I lost it. I... oh, God.
I lost my ring.
I lost my ring. I lost my ring.
I lost my ring.
I lost my ring.
I lost my ring.
Hey.
What the hell are you doing?!
You wouldn't return my calls.
You can't just show up, not when there are murderers everywhere!
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry...
About everything.
I should have told you the minute we ran into Walsh.
You should have told me before you proposed, before you said you loved me, before you asked me out.
Michaela, come on...
Were there others?
What, people I hooked up with?
Men.
- Men you had sex with.
- No.
- Because if you're gay... 
- I'm not gay.
- If you are gay...
-  I'm not gay!
People are gay. My cousin is gay.
It's not a big deal.
- I'll still be your friend, but I just...
- Michaela!
It was a stupid thing that happened when I was a kid, a horny kid.
I'm not some guy on the down low.
You know that.
I love you.
I'm not gay.
My wedding dress is vera wang...
Not off-the-rack vera wang...
Bespoke vera wang.
It cost me a fortune.
So, you better be sure.
You can't embarrass me, Aiden.
I have a plan for my life, and it doesn't include you ruining us.
You hear me?
So you'd better be sure because if you ever do anything like that again,
I will divorce you, and I will take all your money, and I will destroy any chance you have at a political career.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I appreciate your patience.
I just needed some time to ensure I could be fully committed to the case.
So, you've come to a decision?
I have.
Caught ya!
Sorry.
Just a little snack.
You guys come to a decision yet on that football player?
She didn't tell you?
I'd like to announce the new owner of the trophy...
A student who has shown dedication, hard work, and the audacity to speak up for the pawns in this world.
Mr. Gibbins, come claim your prize.
From this point on,
I'd like to ban any further discussion on the Lila stangard murder in this classroom, as I'm representing one of the defendants,
Rebecca Sutter.
I know.
Frank and I had the same look on our face when she told us.
Well...
She can't resist a challenge, can she?
Annalise, I heard you were on this case, though it doesn't look like it'll be a long one anymore.
Excuse me?

"How to get away with Murder"...
It's about the Lila Stangard murder.
Sam knew her.
He was supposed to be at Yale the night she was killed, and I need for you to tell me that his alibi checks out.
Okay.
Dr. Keating didn't show.
He left the garage at 7:00 P.M., wasn't back till 6:00 the next morning.
- His alibi's solid.
- You're sure?
He never left, Annalise.
Tell me what's on the phone, Rebecca.
Does anyone else know about this?
Only Rebecca and I know it exists.
- We can use it, right?
- We'll see.
Why wouldn't we? I mean, those photos...
Mr. Gibbins, you did your job.
Now let me do mine.
Why is your penis on a dead girl's phone?


We're Not Friends sync and corrected by ninh www.addic7ed.com web dl sync snarry
Let's just get the hell out of here now.
Flashlight!
Hey, hey.
Jen cannot find out about this, okay?
- Deal.
- Okay.
What was that?
Who's there?!
Can we go?
Why is Frank calling you?
What?
I saw your phone, Laurel.
What the hell's going on?
Laurel, please don't say you told Frank about this.
You people tell me that I can't call Aiden, and you called Frank?
I swear to God, Laurel, if you told him anything...
I slept with him. Okay?
And I didn't call him.
He's calling me bec...
W... whatever. It doesn't matter.
It does matter.
Otherwise, how do we know you're telling us the truth?
Why would I tell you? We're not friends.
Wait. So, you screwed Frank while you were still seeing Kan?
I'm a cheater, yes.
And a slut and a bad person and now a murderer.
Judge me if you want.
Just do it while we're carrying the damn body!
All people have secrets, Miss Castillo.
Certainly, you take that into account when picking a jury.
Definitely.
In fact, there's been a rise in stealth jurors... people who actively try to get on a jury to sway the verdict.
I know what a stealth juror is.
Your need to show off is something to talk to your therapist about.
Mr. Johanson, can you tell me...
I wasn't showing off.
Oh, yeah, baby, it's on.
I was answering your question...
"how do defense attorneys get screwed by juries?"
Mentioning stealth jurors was me giving an example.
I wasn't... showing off.
Somebody woke up in a mood to fight this morning.
Mr. Johanson...
What's a sample question to ask during your first stage of voir dire?
Um...
Have you decided what to do with the phone?
Not the time nor the place.
I know, but, um... I was thinking before we turn it over to the police, we can trace the cell number of the guy who sent those photos.
I'm not sure we should turn it in at all.
How long did it go on?
Don't you dare say that you were just sending photos, because I know you were screwing her.
So I need to know... how long did it go on?
Just the summer.
She was in my class, started coming to my office hours...
How many times?
I don't know.
Six, seven...
Where?
My office.
Her car once.
But you wanted more than that, didn't you?
It turned you on just to think about Lila... touching yourself, taking those pictures.
It wasn't like that.
Then why did you lie to me?!
I was afraid you'd think I hurt her.
But I could never do that. You know me.
Did you love her?
No.
It... it was her. She was persistent.
She kept coming to me about her family, about her boyfriend.
Annie, she was just lost.
Just like you found me.
- No.
- That's how you like your mistresses, huh?
Weak, broken messes that you just clean up.
Okay, this was not us.
You were never just some affair.
Tell that to your first wife.
You were the one.
- Oh...
- Okay? Annie, stop.
- This was just sex, Annie.
- No.
- It was nothing else, okay?
- No.
I love you.
No. No. You don't get to say that.
You don't get to... don't touch me!
Shh! Annie!
Ow!
Don't touch me!
- Just stop it.
- You get out!
You just get out! Get out!
But it's what you taught us that first week... introduce a new suspect.
We have one now.
Do we?
Or does the fact that Rebecca had Lila's phone point to her as the killer?
Only if we don't find that guy.
It's my decision to make, Mr. Gibbins.
Wait. I...
I don't understand why you're so...
What you don't understand is not my concern.
He didn't drink on the weekdays.
Said it made him slow.
And, being a cop, he couldn't afford to be slow.
Otherwise, he'd make a mistake, or people would suffer.
I mean, the fact he was a cop just made it impossible to get help.
And calling them was only gonna make him come down harder on her later.
And the night your father was killed?
It was normal.
He started yelling as soon as mom walked in, and... I don't know,
I guess I just couldn't do nothing anymore.
So I walked into his bedroom... got his gun... and the next thing I remember is the gun in my hand... it was still hot... and dad on the floor.
He wasn't yelling anymore.
I was so relieved.
But things are better now...
That he's dead.
Ryan, please don't say...
I'm glad I shot him.
We're not just fighting a murder charge.
We're fighting the police.
They've used politics and the media to fuel public outrage and turn Ryan, a boy who spent his entire life witnessing his mother's abuse, into a sociopath who hated his father.
So, how do we win this?
Not based on evidence, but the emotions of the jury.
In emotionally driven cases, jury selection isn't a science.
It's the art of human study.
So how do we ensure the least amount of bias when picking a juror?
Miss Pratt.
By making sure the bias swings in your favor.
For example, men tend to be punishment-oriented and favor the prosecution.
What have you heard in the media about my client?
The short version?
That he's a sociopathic cop-killer.
I'd like to challenge juror 505 for cause.
Juror dismissed.
Beyond gender, what else do we look for during voir dire?
Mr. Gibbins.
Similarities between the juror and your client... any personal connections that will help the juror sympathize.
Are you married?
Divorced.
Happily?
Happily divorced?
Oh, lord, yes.
The defense accepts this juror.
When police testimony is pivotal to the prosecution's case, we have to look for jurors who are prone to distrust authority.
What are some of the signifiers of this?
Mr. Walsh.
Number one is race.
There's a larger distrust of police among black Americans.
You don't call the police in my neighborhood.
Excuse.
Every juror you let in that box can decide your client's fate.
Some cops are bad, some are good... like all people.
Accept.
That episode of "NYPD Blue" where Detective Simone died still makes me tear up.
Excuse.
Grace Kelly and I have tea together quite often.
Dismissed for cause.
Accept, Your Honor.
Excuse.
- Excuse.
- Accept.
- Accept.
- Excuse, Your Honor.
- Accept, Your Honor.
- Accept, Your Honor.
- Excuse, Your Honor.
- Excuse.
12 complete strangers will make or break your case before you've said one word of your opening statement.
I direct you not to discuss the case with anyone, form an opinion, or search out any media coverage of this matter.
Report back at 9:00 A.M. tomorrow.
You're making a scorecard?
We finally have a client I don't hate.
Really?
The guy who shot his dad in the back?
Your Honor, I'd like to file a motion to exclude testimony of the alleged abuse of Sharon Remini.
Your Honor, the prosecution has had weeks to file this motion.
She deliberately waited until after voir dire to undermine my defense.
Ms. Keating, what evidence do you have supporting the abuse claim?
The testimony of the woman who has suffered the abuse for the last 20 years.
Mrs. Remini is here right now.
She could tell you firsthand.
Sharon Remini is the defendant's mother and has every reason to fabricate abuse claims in a desperate attempt to save her son.
In fact, Mrs. Remini never once filed a report with the police.
How could she, when the people that she'd call for help are the drinking buddies of the abuser?!
So, you're admitting you have no actual evidence of the abuse?
I have the testimony of my client, the online diary he's kept for three years that documents the abuse.
It's self-serving hearsay.
I have no choice but to accept the prosecution's motion and block any testimony of abuse, either oral or written, from the defendant or his mother.
Your Honor...
My hands are tied, Ms. Keating.
Want to grab a bite?
I know a great hoagie place down the street.
You're thinking about a sandwich?
Our whole case just got thrown out.
Ryan's going to prison for the rest of his life, where he will probably become somebody's bitch boy, and that's actually the good option, considering his dad's cop buddies might beat him to death first.
Oh, Ryan. I didn't...
No, it's, uh... I've heard worse.
Just... don't tell my mom.
She still thinks there's hope.
Relax. He'll be fine.
Unless he goes home and shoots himself.
In cases where emotion is currency, we have to cater our defense to the jury, which means knowing the jury... learning to read reactions, body language.
I'm assigning each of you your own pet jurors to watch.
Lumberjack?
I don't... I don't want this guy.
Oh, not your type? I'll take him if you give me sexy librarian.
How about the two hairy guys? Enjoy.
Can we can track them outside of court, too?
Yes, but absolutely no contact.
Jury tampering is illegal.
Don't get us thrown in jail.
This is all fun and everything, but what's our defense?
We picked a jury based on arguing abuse.
If Ryan was on drugs, we can argue diminished capacity.
So, we add drug addict to sociopathic cop killer?
I don't think so.
We need a trojan horse to allow the abuse in, a back door.
Oh. This guy knows how to use a back door.
It's Ryan's blog.
If we could get one of the prosecution's witnesses to mention it on the stand, then everything he ever wrote can be allowed into evidence.
Stay up all night. Take notes.
Know the blog inside and out before tomorrow.
There are like 800 entries.
Then you better start reading.
As Ryan's English teacher, did you ever suspect he had negative feelings toward his father?
Yes.
Ryan... was a troubled student.
Everyone at school was aware he had problems with his father.
Why is that?
He performed a song at the talent show once.
The lyrics were... disturbing.
Can you remember what they were?
"I'm gonna put some hot lead in my daddy's head."
No further questions, Your Honor.
The talent show... get the date.
You've got something?
I think so.
Ask about the date.
The talent show that you just referenced... when did it occur?
It was this spring... April, I think.
So April 2014?
That's correct.
Got it.
Mrs. Medick, are these the same lyrics of the song that you just stated for us?
Objection!
I'm just corroborating the facts presented by the prosecution's own witness.
Overruled, Ms. Barker.
Sit down.
Yes, they're the same lyrics.
Your Honor, these lyrics were first published on Ryan's blog in January 2014, three months previous to the talent show.
Therefore, all entries are open to testimony, including the entries where he describes his father's physical abuse against his mother.
Objection! Your Honor already ruled...
That was before you walked the abuse into this courtroom with your own witness.
I need to see this blog, Ms. Keating.
Of course, Your Honor.
I'll allow it into evidence... and, therefore, the abuse.
Your Honor... rule number 106 of the evidence code, Ms. Barker.
Overruled.
Well done.
Yo, Rudy 2.0! Open up!
Oh, yes! Knew it.
I could smell the pepperoni through the wall.
There's no food in my place.
Every time I leave the house, somebody screams "psycho killer" at me.
Oh, my God. It's so good.
I've been staring at the wall for like three days.
I need company.
Otherwise,
I might go all redrum on your ass.
Although something tells me you might be into that.
So, uh... about the phone...
Annalise doesn't want to use it yet...
I know.
You talked to her?
Yeah, she called me this morning, wanted to make sure I was okay... which is more than can be said for you.
No. I-I-I just didn't think you'd want...
I'm kidding.
I get it. I'm your client.
You have to keep it professional.
Or you think I did it.
Lawyers don't ask their clients that.
You're supposed to say,
"of course I don't think you did it."
God. What kind of a terrible lawyer are you?
I'm not a lawyer at all, actually... something you were very happy to tell those cops in jail, if you remember.
Yeah, well... I barely knew you then.
You still don't.
I know you've got issues.
What kind of a person lies his way into jail for his potentially murderous neighbor?
I didn't do it.
I just like making people feel uncomfortable.
Makes me feel better, for some reason.
So I'm not the only one with issues.
Clearly not.
Thanks for the slice.
âª I rewind
âª and the best is a midnight mile âª
âª The lights, the lights, the lights âª
âª Thoughts unkind
There was nothing going on with me and that girl.
I was afraid you'd think I hurt her.
âª Slowed down
âª it all slowed down
âª slowed down
âª It all slowed down
Hi.
Right.
This again.
What are you doing here?
I don't know.
I...
I just...
I just wanted to see you.
You're seriously gonna pretend like you didn't get me fired?
What are you talking about?
You told my boss about us... that I was investigating Sam.
No. I would... I would never...
Come on. Enough with the lies.
Nate, please, you have to believe me. I...
I don't believe you.
To be honest, I don't even care.
You want to sleep next to a killer, go for it.
Oh, that's right. I lied, too.
Sam wasn't away at Yale the night Lila got killed.
Now, see, he left New Haven and drove back here to Philly.
You two have a lovely night.
That Frank again?
Guy's whipped.
You should answer.
He's the last person I want to talk to right now.
It strengthens our alibi, moron.
He'll hear the bonfire in the background.
She's right.
What?
Where the hell are you?
The bonfire. Stop calling me.
Laurel, wait.
Let me explain.
Explain what, how you lied to me just so that you could screw me, add me to your list of student conquests?
I messed up.
I know that... real bad. I just...
I'll do whatever I can to make this right... anything.
Just... just don't shut me out like this.
I can't just...
I...
I'll do anything. Please.
It's too late.
We just need to know more about the jurors.
That way, we can argue a defense that speaks to them personally and will make them acquit Ryan.
And you think they should, even though there wasn't any imminent threat to his mother's life in that moment?
Excuse me. Who's to say there wasn't?
One wrong punch, and she could've ended up dead.
Which is not a legal argument you can use in court.
I came here for you to make me feel better, not worse, thank you very much.
Look, this case is about emotion, which means the only way that you win this is if you get the jury to reject the law and acquit regardless of the evidence.
Jury nullification? Mm. It's illegal.
To tell the jury about it, yeah.
It's not illegal for them to do it.
What, so you think I should tell them?
What would Annalise Keating do?
No, no, you should not... you should not tell them.
'Cause if you do, you go to jail, and that is not cool with me.
My bad.
You need me?
Yes.
If this is about the fight you and Sam had the other night,
- we don't need to talk about it.
- That's not what this is about.
I know how you got
Rebecca's confession tape.
Detective Lahey illegally searched through
Mr. Keating's car last night.
The confession tape... now.
I didn't tell you because...
Why?
Because you know I'd never let you air my dirty laundry to the police?
I thought you had enough on your plate.
Don't you dare say that you were doing this for me,
'cause we both know what person in this house you did it for, and it wasn't me.
I'm sorry.
I should've told you.
Yes.
But thank you for protecting my husband, though.
Now go.
I always liked Sharon.
It's just that it's hard for me to believe what she's claiming about Anthony.
I worked by his side for eight years.
That's just not the guy I knew.
To your knowledge, were there ever any complaints about his service?
He prided himself on being by the book.
Are you seriously looking for sex right now?
We made fun of him for it.
There are a lot of hot guys around here.
- Shh.
- Do you believe that Officer Remini could ever have harmed his wife?
No. The opposite, really.
He was very protective of Sharon.
She was... fragile.
He called her every day, several times, just to check up on her.
Does anyone else think that sexy librarian's a lesbian?
I mean, she just stares at
Annalise's boobs all the time.
They are great boobs.
Can we all focus, please?
Okay, look, your emotional scorecard is cute and pointless, like a dumb blonde.
They need to vote on evidence.
Yeah, and my study group needs this outline by 8:00 A.M.
Honestly,
I've got like six guys on my jock, so I kind of need to focus.
You're sexting six guys right now?
Are there apps like that for straight people?
What happened with the hacker, anyway?
He finally get sick of you using him?
Aw, you think that we're friends, that we'll chat about our boy problems?
The only one with boy problems here is you.
Oh.
We're gonna lose unless we tell the jury about nullification.
It's illegal, and if we got caught,
Annalise gets disbarred.
You know this family, Frank.
We need to help them.
I know that, and we are.
Why the hell are you so worked up about this case, anyway?
Unless your father beat you.
My father did not beat me, okay?
I just...
I want to feel like we're doing something good for once.
Why is that so hard for everyone to understand?
It's not.
Oh, my God.
What?
Lumberjack just messaged me.
That's what you've been doing on your gay-sex app?
Yeah.
I've been stalking him on humpr, waiting for him to out himself.
And he finally bit.
What'd he say?
"All cop killers deserve to fry,
"especially little bitches who don't know how to respect their daddy."
Did you write that message to a gentleman called
"Eightisgreat" on this dating app?
What's your screen name mean?
- I can show you.
- Even after I specifically forbid any talk about the case outside this court?
- Oh, dude.
- I did.
Very well.
You have proven bias against the defendant.
You are dismissed, facing possible penalties.
Alternate juror number one, you are called upon to fill the vacancy.
See? Sexting pays off.
What's your scorecard say?
Uh, at best, we have half of them.
Okay, so maybe there's a rat's ass of a chance we pull this off.
I'm stupid, worthless.
Everything that comes out of my mouth is a lie.
That's what Anthony would say when he'd accuse me of sleeping with a customer, my boss, a bag boy.
And then what would happen?
He'd... beat me.
Slap me, punch me.
Uh, one time, I came home a little late
'cause I was covering for this pregnant girl I work with.
He kicked me in the stomach, said he'd at least make sure
I'd never be able to have a baby again.
Did you ever think about leaving him or pressing charges?
Preggers felt that in the baby maker.
He said he'd kill me if I did.
He said he'd get away with it
'cause he was a policeman and no one would believe it if he killed his wife.
He told me no one would protect me.
But someone did.
My son saved my life, and you all keep saying he's evil, all because he had the courage to be the man my husband was supposed to be.
He shouldn't go to jail for that.
Thank you, Mrs. Remini.
Come on, let it rain, hairy guy.
Let it rain.
Were you under imminent threat when your son shot your husband?
Um, what do you mean?
Would you be dead right now if Ryan hadn't killed your husband?
Did he have his gun aimed at your head, for example?
No.
Right.
Because your son, Ryan, was holding your husband's service revolver in his hand.
He pointed it at your unarmed husband's back, and he fired a shot that killed him.
Isn't that what happened?
Yes, but he...
No further questions.
My engagement ring is gone!
Michaela, it's gonna be light soon.
We still need to get rid of the bags and...
I'm not leaving until we find it.
Are you sure you had the ring on when we left the house?
I already told you, yes!
Oh, my God, what if we don't find it?
I guess you'll just have to cancel the wedding.
Stop!
We still need her to return the trophy to Asher's.
There's no way she can do that.
Look at her.
Oh, no. No, no, no.
We all had to do things tonight that we didn't want to do.
This one is on her.
I'll do it.
And how the hell are you gonna do that?
I don't know. I'll figure it out.
There are cases that speak to evidence, and then there are cases that speak to our humanity, begging our hearts to decide.
What is right is what you feel and what you know in your bones.
Discovering what's happening behind closed doors of a marriage or family is shocking, which is why this case...
Is not about the secrets of a marriage.
This case is about the law.
Ryan Remini protected his mother when no one else would.
In that moment, he had to act, regardless of the consequences.
There was no imminent threat to Sharon Remini the night Ryan shot his father.
For years, he turned away, hung his head in shame whenever he heard his mother's cries...
The law is clear.
The power of judgment does not lie in the hands of a 17-year-old boy.
As she was beat, slapped, kicked by Anthony Remini, a man who tortured his wife and terrified his son.
A police officer sworn to protect his community.
Don't send this young man to prison for doing the same thing you would have done for someone you loved.
You would protect them, and that is not a crime.
Don't make it one.
What's the tally?
Optimistically, we have nine.
So, a hung jury at best and a conviction next trial.
Told you. Psycho boy's off to jail.
It's late, and your jury is out deliberating.
Come on, let's, uh... let's get a beer.
I have a bunch of other work to do, but I'll call you when I leave.
What did you just do?
You don't need to know.
You idiot.
I have to tell Annalise. You know that.
Fine. Go ahead.
Tell her I was showing off.
Which one was it?
Not sure.
I just know someone let a juror know about nullification.
Just say you know but you don't want to tell me.
But don't lie to me, Frank.
If one more man lies to me,
I swear to God...
Annalise, I'm not an officer of the court.
What you don't know you don't have to report.
No.
That's exactly what you're gonna do... report it to the D.A.
- What?
- You heard what I said.
Let her know that the jury's been tampered with.
We received an anonymous tip that someone informed the jury as to how nullification works.
Clearly, it was a member of the defense team.
- Based on what evidence, Your Honor?
- We all know who benefits from this act.
- Again, where's the evidence?
- Stop. Bring in the jury.
Has anyone spoken with or contacted any of you about this case in any way, including a discussion of the concept of jury nullification?
Lying is a criminal act for which I can hold you in contempt.
It was me, Your Honor.
I found information that we have the legal right to vote our hearts.
I shared it with the rest of the jury.
In the case K7439080,
I have no choice but to declare a mistrial.
Jury is discharged.
What?
Bitch, please.
Well, it seems we've done irreparable harm to the public opinion of Ryan.
Due to the abuse defense, the D.A. no longer thinks he's a sociopath.
Therefore, they've bumped the charge to juvenile court.
You're looking at probation, community service, and counseling.
Did you hear that?
You're gonna be okay.
- I mean, is this happening?
- It's happening.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, my God. Are you crying?
No. Allergies.
Hey.
Hi.
You won your case?
Mistrial.
Were you at Yale when Lila when murdered?
No.
She was upset when she called me... said she was gonna do something to hurt herself.
So I skipped my lecture, came back to see her, but I couldn't find her.
She stopped answering her phone.
So I drove back to New Haven.
I was back in my hotel by morning.
So you were here in Philadelphia at the exact same time she was being killed.
- Annalise...
- I know.
You didn't do it.
I don't know what to say here.
I'm sorry I slept with her.
I am sorry I lied about it.
But I didn't kill her.
Rebecca Sutter's on her way over.
You're gonna do a psych evaluation on her.
What?
At least that's what we're telling her.
Whatever it takes to figure out what Lila told her about you or if she shared any pictures of you... of your face.
Annie, this... this is not a good idea.
Game face on.
Rebecca, this is my husband, Sam.
He's gonna be helping us out tonight.
Hi.
Hi.
Can we get this over with?
So, would you describe yourself as depressed?
Do you ever worry that you might harm yourself?
I have a high I.Q., a wide range of generalized neuroses, and a slight tendency towards paranoia.
You've been evaluated before.
Juvie.
You want to know if I killed Lila, right?
No, no.
This is a standardized psychological test.
It just helps present you as a credible witness.
All right, Rebecca, let's just talk about how you knew her.
We met at the bar.
She was a spoiled sorority girl who wanted a thrill, so she asked if she could help me deal.
Who was she selling to?
Other students, mostly girls at Kappa Kappa Bitch.
So, how did you end up with her phone?
She left it at my apartment the night before.
Said she was done dealing.
Did Lila ever share any details about the relationship she was having with this man?
Just that he was married.
She called him Mr. Darcy.
She thought it made her sound smart and not like every other dumb girl obsessed with Jane Austen.
And is there any reason you think that Mr. Darcy had something to do with her death?
He was some sad old man, bored with his marriage, excited to be doing a hot, young piece of ass.
She probably got sick of it and broke it off, so he killed her.
Do you have proof of that?
Or could that be, as you said, your "slight tendency towards paranoia"?
There's a penis pic. Isn't that proof?
Right.
So, she never said who he was, what he did for a living?
Annalise is trying to find him.
Well, I wish she found him already.
Then I wouldn't be here talking to you.
Hey. Uh, how was it?
Like being strip-searched with words.
Bathroom?
Yeah, upstairs, end of the hall.
So, she doesn't know who you are,
Mr. Darcy.
That's it?
That's all you have to say to me?
Am I forgetting something?
I need to know if you believe me.
You're a liar.
At this point, that's all I know for sure.
Sleep on the couch.
I'll do it.
Hey.
I'm not supposed to be here.
So, what?
We finally gonna talk this through?
No.
Then why are you...
You said you would do anything for me.
Did you mean it?
Yeah.
I need to know for sure.
Yes, Laurel.
Why? What's going on?
I need your help.
What the hell?
You didn't tell her, did you, that I was the one who messed with the jury?
You think you'd still be working here if I did?
Why didn't you?
I mean, 'cause did you ever think I wanted her to know that we won this case because of me?
We didn't win anything.
It got us a mistrial, which was lucky.
No, it was smart, but thank you...
I mean, if that's what you're looking for me to say.
Thank you for picking me, making me Frank's girl.
Thank you for watching over me, for saving poor, little Laurel.
I wanted to believe you were something else, not the clichee little girl who went to Brown.
Oh, right, because you knew she would never screw you.
Like I'd ever want to screw you.
I have a boyfriend.
Hey! Did you get a verdict?
Mistrial.

ANNALISE: Previously on
How To Get Away With Murder...
I'm representing one of the defendants,
Rebecca Sutter.
Does anyone else know about this?
Only Rebecca and
I know it exists.
Sam? Why is your penis on a dead girl's phone?
Did Lila ever share any details about this man?
Just that he was married.
She called him Mr. Darcy.
LAUREL:
Thank you for picking me,
making me Frank's girl.
I have a boyfriend.
I know how you got
Rebecca's confession tape.
We both know what person in this house you did it for, and it wasn't me.
Rebecca?
Wes, you can't trust Annalise.
What happened?
The wallpaper, Wes.
Look at the wallpaper.
What the hell are you doing here?
Your husband's Mr. Darcy.
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
Oh, yeah.
Yeah! Middleton football!
What's up, girl?
(CELLPHONE RINGS)
Huh.
Alicia.
Hey. What time you going to the bonfire, girl?
What? Study group?
No, I don't have to study.
I gots the trophy.
I got to call you back.
(POUNDING ON DOOR)
ASHER: Is Michaela in there with you?
I want my freaking trophy back.
Open up!
I know you're in there!
(GASPS) Everyone, get down.
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING
IN DISTANCE)
(POUNDING ON DOOR)
Connor.
ASHER: Are you bitches seriously trying to ignore me right now?
Let me in.
And you guys call me immature?
I'm, like, the most grown-up grown-up ever compared to your dumb asses!
(POUNDING CONTINUES)
We should just let him in.
ASHER: Open up the damn door!
If he's been in the house, he'll suddenly be a part of it, you know?
Five of us witnessed him here.
Then Daddy Millstone can help get us off.
We could get him to step in the blood.
It's not a bad idea.
Yeah!
No! He wasn't part of this.
Do you think that I wanted to be a part of this?
Wait. Listen.
(SIGHS)
He's gone.
I texted him.
Told him I was at the library.
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
ANNALISE: Take your seats.
We have a lot to get through today.
Our lesson, habeas corpus, which translates into
"produce the body."
Who can tell us how that applies to the case Fay vs. Noia?
WES: Your husband's Mr. Darcy.
You're confused.
Listen to yourself.
You just can't stop lying.
Wes, just sit down.
You're disgusting.
Let me explain.
You disgust me.
Wes, come back here.
Wes, come back here.
Come back here.
Wes, don't you leave this house!
Someone's having a brain fart.
Fay v. Noia declared an individual whose imprisonment doesn't meet the requirements of law must be released.
This is done by way of habeas corpus,
AKA to produce the body.
Thanks, Miss Pratt.
Who can tell us what happens in a habeas corpus proceeding?
(WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)
Something's come up.
Class is dismissed.
Keating Five, stick around.
Looks like the Keating Five might be four from now on.
LAUREL: Maybe Wes is sick.
I bet the pressure finally got to him and he dropped out.
That means the trophy's in play.
God, enough with the stupid trophy.
Hey, it's only stupid
'cause you know you'll never win it, loser.
We have a new case.
Okay, but first thing's first.
Is the trophy in play?
To those of you smart enough to know when to shut up.
Twenty-one years ago, when I was a law student not unlike all of you, there was a local man,
David Allen, who was put on trial for the murder of his girlfriend,
Trisha Stanley.
Now, the prosecution argued that David had gone into Trisha's apartment and shot her because he thought that she'd fallen in love with her boss.
And despite there being nothing but circumstantial evidence to support this theory,
David was convicted of murder.
Now, this was the first case that opened my eyes
to the fact that the justice system
doesn't always reward those who tell the truth,
but those who have the power to create their own.
And it's a fact that's pissed me off ever since I heard about this case.
But today, we've been handed the chance
to make an unjust system just.
One hour ago, the Pennsylvania supreme court
granted my petition to develop new
facts of David
Allen's conviction.
In layman's terms, we're working our first appeal.
Now, the emergency hearing that
we've been granted is in three days,
so I hope you're all rested and focused,
because what we accomplish in the next 72 hours will determine David's fate.
DAVID:
Then I was thinking steak.
A New York cut,
16 ounces, well-done.
Lobster, fried chicken, ribs.
Which is why I'm taking votes from everybody who visits.
What would your last meal be?
What if I said you can have them all?
Don't mess with me right now.
The court called.
They're gonna give us one more shot.
That's right.
It's a death-row case.
And unless we do our jobs,
David will die by lethal injection in less than two weeks.
DAVID:
I don't know what to say.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Thank you.
No.
You don't thank me until you're out of this prison.
"That's when I saw
Mr. Allen run from that woman's apartment.
"He had a look of terror in his eyes,
"like he had just done something awful.
"I froze as soon as
I saw him, scared.
"That's when I saw the .38 in his hands."
That's your line, Connor.
Oh, right. Sorry.
"Objection, Your Honor.
Did the witness at the time
"actually know the caliber of the weapon?"
Said defense attorney George Gabler.
"Sustained," said Judge Mills...
Wait.
Millstone?
Ha, very funny.
LAUREL: I'm not kidding.
Your dad's William Millstone, right?
Let me see that.
What the...
I guess we finally know why you're here.
Did you know about this?
No idea.
Wes could be at the police station right now.
He didn't go to the police.
You don't know that.
I do. He's a confused child.
I can handle him.
Maybe I should get a lawyer.
I should go to the police and get ahead of this thing.
Only a bad lawyer would give you that advice.
Well, what is the plan here, then?
This was already a mess, and now you've got to argue a death-row case in three days from now.
Because when I filed the petition,
I didn't know you were screwing some white whore.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Frank just called. He said you should go over now.
Great.
Bon.
Look, I just...
I want to say thank you for putting up with all our crap.
I know it's a lot.
It's for Annalise.
I'd do anything for her.
(SIGHS)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
We missed you in class today.
(DOOR CLOSES)
You haven't been answering your phone or your door.
Everyone's been asking for you.
They're worried that you were sick.
We even got a new case today, a death-row appeal.
It would be a shame if you missed the opportunity to work on it.
WES: You can take that back.
I don't want it.
You and Rebecca?
What do you want?
That's funny, because that's what I came here to ask you.
What you want.
Stop this.
Stop what?
You know what.
I wrote it all down, everything I know.
I have another copy in a safe-deposit box.
One phone call and it gets sent to the police.
Unless?
You get Rebecca back.
Are you in love with her?
This isn't about a crush.
It's about doing the right thing.
And you think that means protecting the drug dealer next door?
Putting your blind faith in someone you barely even know? Why?
And please don't tell me it's because you think she's innocent.
I taught you better.
I think she's as innocent as your husband.
You really need to stop thinking that me protecting Rebecca and my husband are mutually exclusive.
The idea that I don't have her best interests at heart is only in your head.
So prove it.
Find her and get her back here.
Whatever it takes.
Or I swear to God,
I'll tell the police everything.
(LIQUID POURING)
There you are.
Thought you might be avoiding me.
You were the one out of the office all day.
Annalise having you do some spy work?
What kind of spy would
I be if I told you what I was doing?
Oh, come on.
Afraid you'll kiss me again if we get too close?
I think it was the other way around, actually.
We'll call it mutual.
How's that?
We'll call it
"never happening again."
How's that?
Coffee ready?
Fresh pot.
Frank.
You forgot your coffee.
Right.
I'd like Mr.
Gibbins brought up to speed.
Now.
ASHER: Professor Keating,
I know you're busy.
I just wanted to ask, did you know my father presided over the original
David Allen trial?
So,
Wes, you're not contagious, are you?
CONNOR: That depends.
Is lying contagious?
Honestly,
G, enough with the secrets.
LAUREL: Ignore them.
They're just mad because they know if they ever missed class,
Annalise would not care.
So, what do I need to know about this case?
ANNALISE:
The puppy's acting up.
I need you to find
Rebecca right away.
I'm guessing she's being put up by one of her drug connections.
And what do I say to her?
I asked you to find her, not make contact.
We have less than 65 hours before we argue in front of the state supreme court.
That means no sleep until we find out how to win the appeal.
Wes and Laurel, find out if there was any ineffective counsel.
Start with a visit to his original attorney,
George Gabler.
Believe me, this case was unwinnable.
I mean, you got David all but caught with a smoking gun.
You got the neighbors who all heard the fight the night before.
(SCOFFS)
Do I expect this to slow you two down?
You kids, with all your hope, all this, you know,
"Everybody gets a blue ribbon," nonsense.
You want some real advice?
Two words. Corporate law.
ANNALISE: Connor and Michaela,
the original prosecutor,
ADA Vince Travers.
Travers left
the case mid-trial.
I want to know why.
I want to know if there's a story behind his disappearing act.
VINCE: State was hacking
our budget big time
in the early '90s.
I got burnt out, frankly.
Needed a minute to relax.
CONNOR: So, that was it, then?
Just dropped a big case like that?
It was the case or me.
Bonnie, the eyewitness,
Linda Morelli, I want to know if there's anyone else she saw that day that could be a suspect.
I'm going to her place tomorrow.
What about me?
I could go with.
Old ladies find me charming.
ANNALISE: Great.
Take Mr. Millstone with you.
Yeah. Team Bosher!
BONNIE: There's nothing else you recall seeing that day
before seeing David leave the scene of the murder?
Gosh,
I wish I could say, but that's a lot of years ago.
And a lot of time trying to push the memory out of my head, not back in.
Excuse me, ma'am, but are those prescription glasses you're wearing?
Yes.
And I know why you're asking, but I didn't need them till a few years ago.
I wish it were different.
But I saw him with that gun.
LAUREL: David had an alibi?
GEORGE: Oh, yeah.
Guy named J-Wat.
Sky-high on heroin every time I tried to talk to him.
I didn't need the jury to associate David with someone like that.
CONNOR: Appreciate your help.
Know how busy you must be.
VINCE: All right.
Well, have a good one.
Vince, you said you left the David Allen trial so you could relax.
How relaxing were the depos you took in the state's case against the dockworkers' union two days later?
MICHAELA: Travers won't admit to any of this on record, but apparently he was tipped to there being perjured testimony in the David Allen case.
He didn't know who it was, but he sent word to Judge Millstone to look into it, and...
And?
(SIGHS)
And apparently Judge Millstone did nothing about it.
ASHER: What?
Okay, guys, this Travers guy is clearly a whack job.
Go on, Miss Pratt.
MICHAELA:
Travers was re-assigned to a different case by the DA.
He said he thought there was pressure to convict, perhaps even motivated by race.
Okay, seriously, my father isn't a sleaze.
He wasn't a part of some racist scheme.
Really?
Where is it you summer again?
It's not just white people who go to Kennebunkport.
My father wrote the book on judicial conduct, literally.
He's a highly respected federal judge.
You don't get to where he's gotten by burying evidence of perjury.
Believe me, my dad wouldn't do this.
Looks like we have a new target.
Judge William Millstone.
You wouldn't be the first person in the world disappointed by your father.
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
(TIRES SQUEAL)
LAUREL: There's a gas station up on Elm that's open.
Where's Elm? Maybe Sam knows.
I mean, he's lived here the longest, right?
What, any ideas, pal?
WES: We shouldn't stop around here.
We could run into people we know.
Go to
Route 6 instead. We'll find a station out there.
Where the hell is Route 6?
Oh, my God. It's Asher.
(TIRES SCREECH)
Wait, really?
You want to come over?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Yeah.
Totally. I'll be there in 20.
Yes!
(LAUGHS) This is freaking whack-a-mole.
GLORIA: Asher.
I thought I heard someone.
Hey, Gloria.
I think I left a book in here a while back.
GLORIA: Good luck finding it.
Your father won't let me cross this line to tidy up.
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah,
I think I'll look for a few more minutes, and then I'll give up.
ANNALISE: Who's J-Wat?
Jason Watkins.
He was this kid in my volunteer program.
He had this job interview, but no clothes to wear, so I met him at my apartment to get him a suit he could borrow.
All right, so there was only the two of you in the apartment?
No one saw you?
No.
I chilled with him till about 8:00, then I went to Trisha's alone.
Saw the police cars parked out front and...
Anyway, not much of an alibi now, is it?
You have any idea where we can find him?
No clue.
He lived up on 72nd by the bus station.
We'll try to find him.
Wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on.
Seriously, how you liking our chances?
If I spend the afternoon sitting here looking at your sad face,
I don't like them at all.
(LAUGHS)
All right.
CONNOR: What's wrong with looking into Daddy Doucheface?
Would you want one of us doing it to yours?
Sure.
Maybe they could actually tell me something about the guy.
Wow, someone have daddy issues?
(DOOR CLOSES)
Someone have a gay fiance?
What did we find?
Not much.
There isn't anything in the trial transcript to suggest that Judge Millstone was prejudiced toward a conviction.
And I can't find a single allegation of misconduct in his over 20 years on the bench.
Maybe Asher was right.
Maybe Travers was just trying to get me out of his office.
Do I detect prejudice in your voice?
Not at all.
If you look at it through the lens favorable to your friend's father, you're not gonna find what you're looking for.
Clinical objectivity,
Miss Pratt.
Professor Keating?
I have no time now.
I don't care.
Time's running out for Rebecca, too.
She has a hearing next week.
I told you I'll find her.
You have to trust me on that.
Did you find Jason Watkins?
BONNIE: Yes.
I want to talk to him.
OD'd 15 months ago.
(SOBS)
Come on, girl.
ANNALISE: I need you to do something else for me.
Just between us. No one else.
Whatever you need.
WILLIAM:
So, how's it going in school?
You still working
with that attorney?
What's her name?
ASHER: Annalise Keating.
You know, we're actually working on an appeal for a case that you presided over.
David Allen?
Guy in North Philly, convicted of killing his girlfriend?
Sure.
You know, as a kid,
I used to always look through your journals.
Years of meetings meticulously documented.
It's impressive.
In all that time, there's only one day unaccounted for.
One in 30 years.
The day you met with the prosecutor on the David Allen case.
I don't follow you.
Did the ADA in that case,
Vince Travers, tell you that someone had committed perjury?
Where'd you get an idea like this?
That same summer, a month after that verdict, you received your federal appointment.
You were an underdog for the job.
Mom always said your pal, Art Trucco, put in a good word for you.
Is this Keating woman putting these crazy ideas in your head?
Your whole life, you have prided yourself on the fact that you don't lie.
And now I'm sitting here accusing you of grave judicial misconduct, and your only response is to ask me where
I got the idea?
Tell me I'm wrong, Dad.
Please, tell me that you didn't get to where you are on the back of a man who's gonna die.
Please, Dad.
Tell me I'm wrong.
You can't, can you?
Get out.
Dad...
After all I've done for you?
You ungrateful little twit.
Get the hell out of my house.
(CROWD CHEERING ON TELEVISION)
Welcome back, Mr. Millstone.
Ready to rejoin the effort?
That depends on your concession to my two stipulations.
Those being?
One, you spare my father.
No one can know the role he played in
David's conviction.
So, he did play a role.
Like I'm gonna tell you that before you agree to my demand.
My father's name stays out of it.
Agreed or not?
Agreed. Demand number two?
I want the trophy.
Deal.
If your information is as good as you say it is.
Oh, it's good.
ANNALISE: We still
don't know who falsely
testified in David's trial, but we do know it was to satisfy this man.
Art Trucco is a state senator who, for reasons we need to find out, needed David Allen to go down for this murder, so much so that he convinced someone to lie on the stand.
If we can find out who this was, we stand a good chance of seeing this conviction overturned.
We have 12 hours till court.
Let's make David proud.
This isn't my...
This isn't my...
Who's on Trucco's taxes?
That's me.
$30,000 a year?
How can we pay teachers in this country so little?
Welcome to America.
WES: I apologize for the late hour.
I was hoping to talk to your husband about a case he worked back in '93.
ASHER: Is it possible Trucco was a big player
during the re-districting strike?
Trucco's son was a cop.
Maybe he knew the lead detective.
Or David's bank did business with Trucco.
Or how about an affair with a witness?
Are you talking about the neighbor who heard the shot or the co-worker?
(SIGHS)
(GROANS)
(CLEARS THROAT)
(SNORES)
(SNORING)
(DOOR OPENS)
Little late to go out, isn't it?
You worried about me now?
That's cute.
You're looking for
Rebecca. Right?
The puppy's got you running recon for him now?
Maybe Rebecca's our client and I'm just curious about what's going on with her.
Nice try.
(DOOR CLOSES)
With me. Now.
Stop leading Frank on.
What?
Frank and I are just...
Don't, Laurel.
I see the way you look at him.
More importantly,
I see the way he looks at you.
And let's be honest.
It's not Frank a rich girl like you ends up with, is it?
And you know that.
Hell, that's the fun in it for you.
No, that's...
But what sucks is,
Frank doesn't know that, that you're just leading him on, letting him believe he has a shot with you.
And when he finds out he doesn't, that's going to hurt him.
You're becoming a real asset to this team.
I would hate for
Annalise to find out you were screwing with someone she considers family.
DAVID: Of course I know who Art Trucco is.
He owned a bunch of properties in Fairmount.
They were trying to raise the rents to get people to move out, poor people, mostly.
Poor black people.
Well, white folks could afford the higher rents. (SIGHS)
Trisha was leading the charge against the development, but she had no power.
Definitely not enough to keep him from doing whatever he wanted.
Or that's what he wanted you to think.
(SIGHS)
(CONNOR SLURPS)
Oh, what do you want?
The real about you and Rebecca.
You tapping that ass or what?
That's none of your business, Connor.
She's right. It's not.
Hmm. Evasive. Interesting.
You guys, stop.
Must be hot, sleeping with a murderer.
Wait, you're screwing our client?
No.
And the guy with the corrupt dad doesn't get to say crap to me right now.
Take that back.
LAUREL: Why should he?
Your dad sent a guy to death row for no reason.
MICHAELA: Honestly, how does that feel?
Knowing that your charmed existence came at the expense of another man's life?
CONNOR: Well, I'm sure it's not the first instance the Kennebunkport Millstones have profited off other people's misfortunes.
(GROWLS)
That's the best thing I've seen in days.
What the hell is going on here?
Man's life hangs in the balance and this is how you spend your time?
ASHER: Wait. What is this?
MICHAELA: It's mine.
It's from Trucco's real-estate group.
ASHER: (GROANS)
I've seen this logo before.
I saw him with that gun.
In Linda
Morelli's parking garage.
People, the key eyewitness lives in a building owned by Senator Trucco.
So, it's the teacher.
It's always the one you least suspect.
(SIGHS)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Just so you know, we're all set on that other thing.
Good. And, Frank?
Thanks.
She seems nervous.
Wouldn't you be?
(DOOR OPENS)
You know your life's weird when you're happy to be back in court.
For the last time, if I have anything to say about it.

Oyez, oyez, oyez.
All men or persons who stand bound by recognizance or who otherwise have business before this court may now appear and they shall be heard.
In July of 1993, Miss Morelli, you faced an eviction suit by the owner of your building.
Why were you being evicted?
For failure to make rent.
I was three months behind.
My husband, he gambled, and...
ANNALISE: So you were being thrown on the street, and yet four days after you testified to seeing David Allen, the suit was dropped.
According to the records we've obtained, you never paid the rent you owed.
Is that because your payment was your testimony in the David Allen trial?
(SCOFFS)
Can you tell the court who owned your building?
Green Ash properties.
That's Art Trucco's company, no?
The same Art Trucco who's gone on to become
State Senator Trucco?
That is correct. But I...
Did anyone associated with Mr. Trucco tell you that your rent problems would disappear if you testified that you saw David Allen carrying the gun that day?
CLARK: Objection, Your Honor.
The witness cannot speak for the intentions of Senator Trucco.
ANNALISE:
Which is why I would like to ask the state at this time to subpoena Senator Trucco.
What? No!
My client is set to die based on the perjured testimony of Miss Morelli.
That is an egregious lie.
Perjured testimony bought by Senator Trucco.
Would the court like to be put on record for refusing to hear his testimony, all the while
Senator Trucco is sitting in his corner office right across the street?
Please, Your Honor.
Senator Trucco, in 1993, you developed the land at Penn's Landing into what is now Trucco Plaza.
Is this correct?
ART: Let's see.
I know this. You know this.
The few million people, annually, that traffic the plaza know this.
Can we cut to the chase here?
My constituents expect me to make the most of my time.
I have a record of an injunction brought against your project by Trisha Stanley, advocating for the thousands of citizens living in low-income housing who would be displaced by your project.
Was there a question in there?
ANNALISE: Ten days after,
Miss Stanley was murdered.
Your attorney struck down the injunction, and your project went forward unopposed.
So my question is,
Senator Trucco, did you have
Trisha Stanley murdered?
(SPECTATORS MURMURING)
Are you out of your mind?
Your Honor, this has gone on long enough.
Did you convince your tenant,
Linda Morelli, to testify that
Trisha Stanley was killed by her boyfriend, David Allen?
You are way off base.
I recommend you rein this in.
Explain why your eviction suit against Miss
Morelli was dropped despite her inability to pay rent.
JUDGE: Miss Keating...
Is it because her lost rent money was nothing compared to the millions you made once Miss Stanley was out of your way?
(GAVEL BANGS)
Answer the question, Senator.
JUDGE: Miss Keating, enough.
Why was Linda Morelli granted these concessions?
Mr. Chief Justice,
I have extended great deference to the court by showing up here today.
But I am not gonna put up with this any longer.
I am sorry, Senator, if you do not have the time to answer for who bore the real cost of your development.
CLARK: Objection!
Not just
Trisha Stanley and her boyfriend, David Allen, who served 21 years in prison...
CLARK: Your Honor, please!
But the thousands who were displaced in the name of lining your pockets...
JUDGE: Miss Keating!
The majority of whom are poor, powerless, and didn't bear the color of skin desirable to your business interests.
JUDGE:
That's enough, Miss Keating!
You tore a community apart.
JUDGE:
Miss Keating, I want order!
You tore families apart.
You destroyed lives, Senator.
JUDGE: Miss Keating!
Admit it.
JUDGE: Miss Keating.
Admit you killed Trisha Stanley and had my client,
David Allen, set up for her murder.
That is enough!
Do you hear me?
You say another word, and I'll have no choice but to throw you in jail.
If I wanted to be her before...
That's not something she can teach us.
Here's a question, if she gets disbarred, does it go on our records, too?
CRIER: Will the defendant please rise?
JUDGE:
Miss Keating, may I say, we are beyond dismayed by the conduct you've exhibited here today.
You've operated with blatant disrespect for this court and its protocols, and your argument, when isolated from all the bluster, seems to consist entirely of speculation.
The case against your client seems to be built on the same ground, rooted singularly in an eyewitness testimony that we no longer have faith in.
As a result, it is our recommendation that the District
Attorney's office open an investigation into the actions of Senator Trucco and the state's original witness,
Linda Morelli.
(SPECTATORS MURMUR)
Now, Mr. Allen.
We have no choice but to vacate the judgment...
(SPECTATORS GASP) conviction, and sentence of death, and prohibit a re-trial.
You are a free man.
(GAVEL BANGS)
Let me know what you have.
(CHUCKLING) What?
For dinner tonight.
(SIGHS)
Thank you.
(VOICE BREAKING) Thank you.
Go be with your family.
(CRYING)
Oh, my baby.
WES: You wanted to see me?
There's been a major development in Rebecca's case.
The police found new evidence that Griffin killed Lila because she was dating another man.
REPORTER: After receiving an anonymous tip,
detectives searched
Mr. O'Reilly's car
and discovered a cellphone
believed to belong
to Lila Stangard.
ANNALISE: I need you to do something else for me.
Whatever you need.
Have your guy clear any source of where the photos came from, phone number, identifying information.
He can do that, correct?
I'll make sure.
Be 100% sure.
Police are reporting the cellphone may contain
evidence of a relationship
that Lila Stangard was having with an individual
other than Griffin O'Reilly.
Our sources report there may be even photos
that support a theory
that Lila broke
the couple's virginity pact,
giving O'Reilly a motive in Miss Stangard's murder.
According to police, they're...
(VIDEO STOPS)
What about your husband?
That's my concern, not yours.
Go tell Rebecca it's safe to come home.
Frank has the address where she's staying.
"Whatever it takes."
Isn't that what you said?
(DOOR CLOSES)
Oh!
God, you're such a klutz.
I got this, Frank.
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
I didn't want to have to say this, but I'm not into you, and it's not just because we work together.
So you have to stop.
Let's keep this professional.
Otherwise I'm gonna have to tell Annalise.
Tell Annalise? Wow.
I'm not going to. I just...
Yeah, you're not into me.
You don't have to say it twice.
(DOOR CLOSES)
I don't get it.
Did you read it?
What the hell is she doing?
She's defending you.
None of this is true.
But it's good for you.
You never had the phone, and now Griffin has a motive.
If he knew Lila was cheating on him...
He didn't.
(SIGHS) You don't know that.
I do.
We both do.
I mean, how are you okay with this?
'Cause you told me you didn't do it.
And unless you're lying to me,
I don't think you should go to jail for something you didn't do.
No one's ever believed in me like this before.
I know.
Come home.
Let her defend you.
REPORTER: According to police,
they're now seeking additional evidence,
hoping to identify
the man in the photos
on Miss Stangard's cellphone.
Is this man possibly a new suspect?
Or is it the proof prosecutors needed
to show Mr. O'Reilly
had motive for
killing his girlfriend?
Damn.
I was hoping I'd get to be the first one to tell you.
You like the new wallpaper?
It's the only thing left that tied you to the photo.
Unless, of course, there's someone else out there knows what your penis looks like.
(SCOFFS)
Why you doing all this for me?
I'm not angry.
I just... Don't...
I need you.
Don't you get that?
After everything you've done to me, lying to me, screwing that girl,
I need you.
(SCOFFS)
I need you.
Need you.
(VOICE BREAKING) I need you.
(SNIFFLES) I need you.
And I love you.
I love you, too.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
You're back.
For now.
Come in.
I'll fill you in on the next steps of your case.
(CELLPHONE RINGS)
(CELLPHONE BEEPS)
Any luck?
MAN: Just sent it to you.
Surveillance coverage
of O'Reilly for
the last 48 hours.
You're gonna like what you see.
You need anything else?
No. This is helpful.
(CELLPHONE BEEPS)
Yeah!
Wait, really?
You want to come over?
Those fricking liars.
First they steal my trophy, then they go party at the bonfire after making fun of me for wanting to go in the first place.
You know you can't tell them about this.
This never happened, you understand?
Of course.
I'd never be that guy.
Do you think it could not happen one more time?
(CELLPHONE RINGS)
Hey.
ANNALISE: (VOICE BREAKING)
Are you with him?
What?
Do not lie to me right now.
I don't know who you're talking about.
Sam! Are you with Sam?
No. No, why? What's wrong?
(BREATHING SHAKILY)
Something terrible's happened.
(SOBS)

## S01E7

Previously on
"How to get away with Murder"...
The search continues for Lila Stangard.
What happened?
They found her in one of those water tanks.
Afraid you'll kiss me again if we get too close?
"Never happening again."
That guy, he was just sex.
Oliver. I said leave!
You get Rebecca back.
Are you in love with her?
I need you to do something else for me.
Whatever you need.
Surveillance coverage of
O'Reilly for the last 48 hours.
Go tell Rebecca it's safe to come home.
I don't think you should go to jail for something you didn't do.
No one's ever believed in me like this before.
Come in.
You're safe now.
You're safe.
He's dead. He's dead.
We have to go.
There.
Good enough until we get you out of here.
Wes! Hurry the hell up!
Come on.
What?
Thank you.
It's gonna be fine.
Griffin called me around midnight, asked if I had anything I could sell him.
So I went to the Frat House and sold him some coke and Molly.
He invited me to hang out, so we started drinking, doing some lines.
Griffin said he had some pot, so we went up to his room to smoke a bowl.
Next thing I know, we're kissing.
Um...
We had just started, when Lila came in.
Apparently, I texted her, which I have no memory of.
I just remember Lila yelling, hitting me.
Griffin pulled her off.
I tried to find her to explain what happened and apologize, but I couldn't, until I got to the roof.
Then I strangled her and stuffed her in a water tank.
Oh, my gosh. You guys are so gullible.
Rebecca, take this prep seriously or go to jail.
Isn't it kind of your job to make sure that doesn't happen?
You slut, white-trash killer.
You made Griffin strangle that girl on the roof.
You liked watching her die because that's the piece of garbage you are!
That's what everyone in the world is gonna say about you.
You don't care, neither do I.
I'm not the one that's gonna be beaten, raped, and violated in jail.
That's on you.
So, what happened the night of Friday,
August the 29th?
Start from the beginning.
Maybe... maybe we should take a break.
Five minutes, and then we'll start again.
And Romeo saves Juliet again.
It's kind of sweet.
It's inappropriate and unprofessional and crazy.
They got to be doing the nasty by now, right?
Although,
I-I can't picture the puppy that way.
Why would you want to?
I picture everyone having sex.
Oh, how's it going with Aiden, by the way?
You two break up yet?
Unh!
Look at me like that again, and I'll file a sexual-harassment suit.
Turn on the news.
What is it?
Sex is out of the bag.
A witness has revealed new evidence
that Rebecca Sutter and Griffin O'Reilly
had sexual intercourse
the night that Lila Stangard was murdered.
There have been rumors of a relationship
between the two codefendants before,
but now an anonymous source is claiming it was miss Sutter
who initiated the physical relationship,
as Mr. O'Reilly had taken a vow of virginity.
Call the judge and get a hearing for a gag order.
Proof of a sexual relationship between the two codefendants
certainly gives more weight to the prosecution's theory
that it was miss Sutter
who manipulated Mr. O'Reilly into killing his girlfriend.
You still feel like making jokes now?
...like the story of a young love triangle
gone tragically awry. sync and corrections by <font color="##FF0000">dreaMaker7</font> www.addic7ed.com web dl sync snarry
The prosecution has leaked gossip to the press in order to slut-shame my client
- and poison the jury pool.
- That is an offensive accusation.
I move for an immediate gag order.
Ms. Keating is speculating, Your Honor.
She can make all the wild allegations she wants.
Slutter cleans up pretty nice.
- My office had nothing to do with this leak.
- Really?
"O'Reilly and Sutter had sexual intercourse
"while high on cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamines,"
And that's a direct quote from the detective's statement in discovery.
Which doesn't prove that my office was behind it.
It could have just as easily been Mr. O'Reilly and his counsel.
Right, because releasing information that paints my client... a devout, born-again Christian...
As a drug-taking, sex-crazed jock serves our case how?
It doesn't matter who leaked it.
Everyone knows that it's the woman who gets vilified in these scenarios.
I mean, look at these articles.
It's my client's face smeared across the front page, not Mr. O'Reilly's.
And that is my fault how?
I don't have editorial control over the papers.
Enough grandstanding.
However this information got out...
And this court will be investigating just that...
The public's appetite for this case could result in undue bias for the codefendants.
Therefore, I'm granting the gag order.
And from here on out, none of you or your clients speak to the press.
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Next case, Bailiff.
- Actually, Your Honor, there is one other motion
I'd like to submit.
It's time-sensitive.
This is a hearing for a gag order, Your Honor.
We're all here already.
Go ahead, Mr. Keegan.
My team's forensic expert reviewed the autopsy photos and discovered
Lilaseveral overlooked red marks on the side of miss Stangard's neck.
He'll testify that these marks are fingernail puncture wounds left by the murderer.
Since my client is a quarterback and keeps his nails clipped short, he did not leave those marks.
What is the motion, Your Honor?
Or is Mr. Keegan here to just testify?
We move to exhume miss Stangard's body.
We believe a second autopsy will point to Rebecca Sutter as the sole murderer.
- Your Honor, hasn't the victim's family
- Mr. Keegan is making outlandish remarks
- suffered enough already?
- In order to fuel vitriol about my client!
The two of you will have plenty of time to righteously object at the hearing tomorrow morning.
We are adjourned.
So, they just dig up her body?
Won't she have turned to jelly by now?
They embalm corpses.
The formaldehyde slows bacterial decay.
I find it sexy/creepy you know stuff like that.
Hey. Connor.
Hey...
You don't remember my name.
No, I totally do. Uh...
Wow. And I thought I was a slut.
Really? You've gotten naked with so many boys since hacker broke your heart, you can't even remember their names?
The important thing is, they remember mine.
- Play on, player.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Hey, you planted that phone in my car.
Okay, like I'd know how to do that.
You guys, this is not...
You can't even believe what you're saying.
I'm laughing at how dumb you are.
You already confessed to killing her.
How dumb are you to think that you're gonna get away with this?
No! Whoa, whoa.
That's the trailer trash I remember.
Is our... is our codefendant harassing you?
Because I would hate to have to file assault charges against miss Sutter, too.
He instigated it.
Well, that's not the way the law works, young man.
I teach my students the law, Mr. Keegan... no one else.
And from where I was standing, my client was defending herself against Mr. O'Reilly, and I have witnesses here who could testify to that.
Well, let's save the fun for the courtroom, shall we?
Stay civilized, young lady.
Rebecca, let's go.
She's a terrorist.
Honestly. It...
It makes me grateful for the miscarriages.
Annie.
I'm serious.
Imagine having a child like that.
Asking for that second autopsy was a brilliant move, and I'd have done it myself if I didn't think that they'd find evidence against my client, which... let's face it...
They probably will.
Relax.
Stop.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
You are working so hard.
Let somebody do something for you.
I said stop.
I need more time.
You get all the time you want.
I'll be here.
It's our job to keep that body in the ground.
First, that means tearing
Griffin's forensic expert,
Dr. Erik Turner, a new one.
These are the thousands of autopsies he's done.
Go through them.
Find anything to discredit him.
Also, come up with alternative theories for the marks on Lila's neck.
- Insect bites, abrasion from the water tank...
- Postmortem decay.
Anything that's not Rebecca's fingernails.
Is it okay if I take a couple hours off on Wednesday?
I just got a call to come in and interview at Sterling & White.
You're meeting at Sterling?
Isn't it a little early for summer associate interviews?
I guess they start at the top of the class and work their way down.
Just be quick about it.
It's all hands on deck here.
Exactly. Shouldn't we all be working full time on this?
Relax, Romeo. I'll be back in time to help out your girlfriend.
- She's not my g...
- Yeah. Whatever you say.
What an adorable setup.
Speak of the devil, and she shall appear.
No need for pleasantries.
We both know why I'm here.
We do?
The city's medical examiner performed a standard autopsy the first time around.
You don't want this motion going through any more than I do.
The surprise of the unknown.
The specter of new evidence undermining the prosecutor's well-laid-out case.
You read my mind.
What's that?
A sealed file... Commonwealth v. Holden.
It'll help you destroy Keegan's expert.
Why not use it yourself?
It'll also discredit about a dozen other convictions the DA's office won in the past five years...
None of which happened under my watch, of course.
Of course.
You'll use it?
I guess you'll see in court.
Expert witnesses are the dirty little secret of our justice system.
What most of the public doesn't know is that it's legal to pay experts for their testimony.
You shell out enough cash, and you can get them to say just about anything.
So, the size, shape, and curvature of the perforations and the postmortem color tint all support my conclusion that these are fingernail puncture wounds.
And you believe that the bruising pattern here points to hand size.
Exactly... Someone with small hands.
Thank you, Dr. Turner. Nothing further.
How do you combat this corruption within the expert community?
You impeach the expert's credibility, preferably by pointing out any sketchy evidence they presented in the past.
Throw shade at them, basically.
Dr. Turner, let's talk about
Commonwealth vs. Holden, a murder trial that you provided expert testimony at last year that helped convict the defendant.
Actually, I think the fact that Mr. Holden was guilty of murder helped convict him.
I have an internal report from the DA's office that questions the methods and conclusions of your work in the Holden case.
Objection! Lack of foundation, Your Honor.
I object, as well.
I haven't seen this report, but even if it checks out, it's hearsay.
It falls squarely within the business-records exception.
So, let's ask Dr. Turner if he was made aware of the report...
Perhaps when the DA's office banned you as an expert witness because of your negligent work?
- Assuming facts not in evidence, Your Honor.
- Counsel is testifying, your honor.
Dr. Turner, were you aware such a report exists?
Yes, Your Honor, but...
Nothing further.
Next, counterattack.
Find an expert to out-expert your opponent's.
Isn't it possible they could be insect bites?
There's a species called...
Redheads, like miss Stangard, have hundreds of freckles, blemishes.
Sometimes, a mark is just a mark.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
They're trying to pin this murder on an innocent girl.
So, please... Look at the book.
When you performed the original autopsy, what did you think the red marks on Lila's neck were?
Freckles.
Upon further research, I now think they're postmortem bites from insects of the culicidae family.
Is that possible, given that Lila Stangard's body was in a water tank for several days?
That makes it even more likely.
The culex species thrives in water-based environments.
Nothing further.
There's one more way to block the motion...
Convince Lila's parents to make a statement against the exhumation.
You figure that out, and you'll get a reward better than the trophy.
No, you listen to me, ma'am.
T-there are rats crapping all over her apartment, spreading God knows what diseases, so maybe he should be the one getting evicted.
Hello?
Tanya's eviction case?
The court isn't letting the Landlord's previous grievances into evidence.
I thought Daniel was gonna write up a motion about...
Well, Dan got a job with the public defender's office.
Tess got a boyfriend, so she stopped showing up.
I have to hire people to replace them, but I don't have any time because my client and her four kids are going to be living on my couch if I don't win this case.
Really?
You wouldn't even give them your bed?
Hello.
Hi.
What?
You know who I could hire without having to give an interview?
I thought you didn't hire first-years.
We don't.
'Cause they're never as smart as you.
Uh...
I know. I know... You would never leave Keating.
I wouldn't?
I'm a desperate man here.
Don't get my hopes up.
Let me... Let me think about it.
Of course, yeah.
You know, just so you know, they, uh...
They finally fixed the lock on my office door, so...
So, you know, maybe...
So...
Dessert could be... Something.
Here's a case where the court ruled against exhumation on religious grounds.
If the stangards were religious, then...
They're not.
That's why they were so weirded out when she made that virginity pact with Griffin.
Hey, what about measuring my nails to see if they match?
If they don't, we can do that whole
"If the glove don't fit, you must acquit" thing.
O.J. Trial.
Yeah. It's... It's just that...
Well...
Okay. It's a stupid idea.
Never mind. I'll shut up.
No, it's not a stupid idea.
Don't patronize me.
And yes, I know what "patronize" means, fancy Ivy League boy.
You think that I've spent my whole time hanging around places like Middleton?
How would I know? You're, like,
the most privatest person ever.
I went to a community college, then got a degree from a night school in Willowick.
- Where the hell's that?
- Exactly.
I'm just saying, you can do something after this that's not dealing drugs.
Like, go to college, law school, even.
Yeah.
And then after that, I'll run for office.
Be the country's first ex-juvie drug-dealer bartender president.
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
I know. I'll stop, okay?
Stop trying to change you or whatever the hell it is you think I'm trying to do.
I'll just stop trying to help.
No. Don't.
You should keep trying.
I got to go.
Don't do anything until I'm back.
Even if someone knocks, don't answer unless you know it's me.
I'll let you know what to do as soon as we make a plan.
Okay?
He wanted to kill me.
- I had no other choice.
- No.
I had to kill him, or he was gonna kill me.
- I saw the trophy sitting there.
- No.
- I hit him in the head. He deserved to die.
- Why are you saying this?
- And I'm glad he's dead.
- Stop it.
- Stop it!
- No!
Look, my trial's in a couple days.
I'm already going to jail.
And now you might, too, because of me, and I will kill myself if that happens.
So, please... please just let me help you for once.
The only thing you can do to help right now is stay in this room and not leave.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Thank you for coming in, miss Pratt.
You're at, uh, Middleton, right?
Yes.
I was also accepted at Yale and Columbia, but I felt that Middleton was a better fit for the kind of hands-on education I wanted.
Uh-huh.
I've admired Sterling & White's work for quite a while now.
The visa antitrust litigation was a master class on innovative trial techniques.
No one told you why you're here, did they?
You mean who referred me?
I hate when this happens.
This is why you're here, miss Pratt.
We represent Robert and Mary Walker.
You're marrying their son Aiden.
Is that right?
This is a prenup.
It's for your protection, as well.
How'd the big interview go?
It was a really great first meeting.
I want to meet with other firms, though, before I make a commitment.
They didn't hire you in the room?
That's a bad sign.
At least she got in the room.
Maybe if you stopped stalking your ex online all day, you'd actually have some interviews of your own.
You people are so boring.
I'm hungry. Food?
I'm okay.
Hey, Mr. Darcy.
So, the terrorist just hangs out at our house in her free time now?
We need to keep a close eye on her until her trial...
Keep her from sabotaging her own case.
I might... Know of a way to help you convince the Stangards to object to the second autopsy.
Something Lila told you?
Her parents didn't trust Griffin.
He was religious and pressuring Lila to be, too.
They worried he was trying to control her, that he had ulterior motives.
So, Annalise is the one who suggested I come with you?
She thought we needed a woman's touch.
Don't think I didn't try to take Michaela instead.
If we're gonna keep working with each other, it cannot be this weird.
You told me to back off, and now you want to be friends?
This isn't high school.
If you don't like me, then I don't like you.
That's how this works.
Freakin' millennials and your damn entitlement.
Here she comes.
Stay calm, do what I said.
Ooh! Hi!
Oh, what a cute puppy!
What's his name?
Mr. Chips.
He's Mr. Chips! So cute.
I've always wanted one like him.
You work for that lawyer.
I've seen you in court.
Mrs. Stangard...
Get away from me.
Please. Just...
There's an ulterior motive to doing a second autopsy on Lila...
One that helps Griffin.
His lawyer's done this before in three of his other cases.
He exhumed his victims' bodies, and each time, his client went free.
And if you let that happen again, the pain you and your family will endure as your daughter is pulled out of the ground, that will all be for nothing, because this only helps Griffin.
The idea of Lila on that table...
I-I didn't want to think of what they did to her.
But then we got to put her to rest... finally.
And now this man...
He pretends he wants to find the truth, which is a lie.
He wants to confuse the evidence, to ensure that no jury will ever convict Griffin or her, these two monsters, of killing our daughter...
...Like animals.
They murdered my baby girl.
So...
I'm begging the court... Please...
My little girl has been through enough.
Just let her rest in peace.
I know that was tough, but she said what we needed to block the exhumation.
It's okay.
She was my friend, okay?
I don't care what that woman said.
She was my friend, and...
Whatever.
Looks like there's trouble in Paradise.
Some guys can only get it up for crazy.
Mystery man's coming.
You forgot his name, and he's still into you?
What do you have, some sort of voodoo penis?
See you back at the house.
I'm so freakin' mad I wasn't born gay.
Julien.
You remembered.
Here's what I think.
There's a bar across the street.
Let me buy you a drink, and if I prove worthy of your time, we move into dinner.
A date.
Yeah. A date.
So, you also forgot that I have a boyfriend.
Well, this couldn't get any more embarrassing.
Relax. We met on humpr.
I barely remember, too.
How about I make you remember?
Ah, okay.
Now I definitely remember.
Thought you could use a drink.
Vodka Martini, twist of lemon.
You're not having one?
I'll have one with dinner.
You hungry? I can make something.
Mnh.
I have to draft this motion in limine.
I'll be here when you're done.
Sam.
Mrs. Stangard made a statement against the exhumation, so...
Thank you.
Please be seated.
Ms. Parks, I understand you have a request.
Yes, Your Honor.
Given the conflicting testimony presented so far,
I felt compelled to hire our own expert, who came to the same conclusion that the red marks on the victim's neck are consistent with fingernail puncture marks caused by a woman.
What the hell are you doing?
I would like to submit these signed affidavits into testimony.
Your Honor, I find it very suspicious that Ms. Parks has suddenly changed her point of view on this motion.
I had to, Your Honor.
It would have been unethical not to report these new findings.
Let's review the new evidence and adjourn until tomorrow.
Next case, Bailiff.
What... W-why did she flip?
I don't know.
We'll find out.
Thank you for meeting me.
What do you need?
Wendy Parks turned on me today in court.
You want me to help you figure out why?
It's not helping me.
It's helping my client.
You mean your husband.
I know you're angry, and I understand that, but...
He didn't do it.
You don't believe that.
You planted Lila's phone in Griffin's car.
What?
You surprised someone's onto your tricks?
You should go.
I tried to give you an out.
Don't forget that when this all goes to hell.
Don't do anything until I'm back.
911. What's your emergency?
Hello?
911. What's your emergency?
Are you okay?
I'm sorry. This... this is a prank call.
Hello?
It's me.
Don't worry. It's a new phone.
What are you doing?
You shouldn't be calling.
I know.
But I just wanted to tell you we're taking care of it.
They didn't want to at first, but I got them to come around.
We're gonna protect you.
The fastest way to uncover someone's secrets...
Get their assistant to talk.
The county employee directory lists Wendy Parks' assistant as Ally Burnham.
Ooh! Bo-o-o-ing!
Ally and the rest of the girls who work at the DA's office hang out at the Thirsty Whale.
Go down there, flirt, find out why she changed her mind on the motion.
All right. So we find ally and we... pump her, so to speak.
On it.
- Connor and Wes, you go, too.
- What do I need them for?
This works on women as well as men.
He's right.
Hey, can I go, too? I'm really good at flirting with girls.
I'm sure. You stay here with us.
Girls' night. Whoo-hoo.
It's a big decision.
I just... I... need a little bit more time.
Okay. I'll call you when I'm leaving.
Yeah, sure. We'll talk about it then.
You think we're gonna lose my case?
That's why you're thinking of taking another job, right?
So you don't go down with the ship.
No, that's not...
How did you know that...
That was Kan, and he wants to know if you're gonna take the job at legal aid.
And you haven't decided because either you actually like this weirdo office or you just need to put a little distance between you and the hot ass in the three-piece...
Don't... tell anyone.
I'm serious. I haven't decided yet.
- Decided what?
- Nothing.
She wants to leave and take a job with her boyfriend.
- Rebecca!
- You idiot.
There are a million and one legal aid clinics and only one Annalise.
I know that! Okay? Just don't tell anyone.
And what if I do?
She'll tell everyone your fiancÃ© wants you to sign a prenup.
It was sticking out of your bag.
- Aiden gave you a prenup?
- His mother did.
And we are not talking about this.
Fine. As long as you don't talk about the Kan thing.
You, too.
Deal.
If both of you stop talking about me and Wes.
We're not screwing.
I know that's what you all think, but we're not, so...
Fine.
Okay. Great.
I actually just got out of a relationship myself.
Oh. What was her name?
Olive.
What happened? She break your heart?
It's worse.
I, um, I actually cheated on her, and she found out, so...
So, uh, ally, you were saying you work at the DA's office.
What's that like?
Hey, rude guy, we are actually in the middle of a conversation.
Thanks.
So, I know that I should apologize, but I... I mean, is there anything that I can actually say that... that... that'll fix it?
I mean, I-I screwed up big-time, and he... S-she... She hates me.
She hates me.
I mean, I get it... I'm the bad guy.
Told you he wouldn't know what to do with the ladies.
He's supposed to be getting information, but instead, he's talking about his boyfriend.
So get in there and shut him up.
Hells no. Annalise finally lets us loose.
I'm getting some tonight.
Time to release the Kraken!
- I'm talking about my dingus.
- Yeah.
The old disco stick.
The Millstone meatsicle.
Mmm!
Oh, yeah.
I see you, nerdy girl who probably still looks hot naked.
I mean... I don't know.
You could give her flowers.
Girls get amnesia the minute you do that.
We'll forgive you the world.
Hey. Uh, I seem to have a problem with my phone.
Your number's not in it.
Her name's Natasha.
Maybe... it's Brenda.
Why am I thinking "Jamie"?
- Are you drunk?
- No.
Wait... Did you say "dru..."
- Yeah.
- Hammered.
Anyway, she temps at the DA's office and said Wendy Parks and
Keegan worked out a plea deal, but only if parks supported the exhumation.
So, Griffin gets off if he testifies against Rebecca, and the D.A. gets a conviction.
You two can go.
Wait... Don't we get a prize?
She said "leave."
We could go to the judge, tell her there's been collusion between parks and Keegan, they're suborning perjury... Something.
No.
Maybe there's another way.
She can let him walk free, just like that?
How is that legal?
The DA is allowed to offer whatever plea deal she wants to you or Griffin.
The only way to stop that deal is to get her to rescind it.
- Why would she do that?
- She wouldn't.
Unless we leak to the press something so deplorable about Griffin that it would make it politically impossible for her to move forward with the deal.
We can't leak anything to the press.
There's a gag order.
Yes.
What if I leak it?
The judge will hold you in contempt.
I can just say I don't know what a gag order is.
But you do.
Let my client speak for herself,
Mr. Gibbins.
So, tell me again about the night you and Griffin slept together.
They violated their own gag order, Your Honor.
And slandered my client in the process.
My client is 21 years old.
She had no idea she was disobeying the law
- Oh, come on!
- When the journalist approached her.
Had I known...
It's a flagrant violation of the gag order and a deliberate attempt to subvert the plea agreement the D.A. offered my client.
You made a plea deal?
You know, you're full of crap, Ms. Keating.
Settle down, Mr. Keegan.
Ms. Parks, was there a deal?
Due to miss Sutter's convenient accusation that Mr. O'Reilly raped her, we have ceased conversation about a plea.
Because she was afraid of public pressure.
My client is entitled to that deal.
Just like he was entitled to physically violate my client's body?
Strike from the record!
There's no jury here, Mr. Keegan.
Ms. Keating, I'm sanctioning you for the gag-order violation.
If I find you instructed your client to break the order,
I'll ensure the state bar launches a disciplinary hearing.
We'll cooperate fully.
Now, regarding exhumation.
Given the numerous allegations of errors being made about the original autopsy,
I'm granting the motion and ordering miss stangard's body be exhumed immediately.
A new medical examiner of my choosing will be conducting a full external and internal second autopsy.
No more arguments about missed evidence.
Afterwards, sealed reports will be delivered to all parties.
I got to hand it to you.
The rape was a nice touch.
That's what happens when you try and take the easy road.
Excuse me?
You don't care who killed Lila.
You just thought it would be easier to convict the townie slut rather than the virgin quarterback.
Or I just know your client did it.
I'd say a prayer those aren't her nails on that poor girl's neck.
Prayers are for the weak.
I'll stick to beating your ass in court.
Hey.
Hey!
You didn't wait for me at the courthouse.
I have to study. Exams are coming up.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Seriously? You're that mad at me?
Wow. Really? The silent treatment?
Okay.
You are such a guy right now,
I'm actually kind of impressed.
Who...
You think I'm messed up? That's you.
You're the one with no life.
Otherwise, why get so obsessed with mine?
Who made you this way? W-was it your mom?
Was she an alcoholic and you miss the drama?
Did your dad hit her? What?
I mean, who made you feel like you're not an actual person unless you are fixing someone else's mess?
I'm not trying to fix you.
I'm trying to help you.
But if you don't want that, I'll stop.
You can lie on the stand, call people rapists...
Whatever you want.
Just don't say I'm messed up because I wanted to help you.
We shouldn't do this.
You're right.

You were born in Ohio.
Willowick's in Ohio.
I looked it up.
You don't seem very Ohio.
Except for the dopey smile you have on your face all the time.
I wasn't born in Ohio. I was born in Haiti.
My mom moved us here when I was 1.
I was the only black kid in our town.
Everyone wanted me to be good at basketball, but I sucked.
I'm allergic to peanuts.
I have a really bad sense of direction.
My mom killed herself when I was 12.

Sorry. I-I-I used to...

Oliver.
He's in the shower.
Those for him?
Uh...
I'll go.
Connor, right?
Hey, I don't want to cause any trouble...
I'm sure.
Look, if you care about the guy at all, don't ever come back here.
Hey.
It's your last day.
You're not even gonna say goodbye?
Rebecca told me about you going to work at legal aid.
Oh, my God. I hate her.
I'm considering going to legal aid.
I haven't decided yet.
Is this about me being a jerk?
'Cause I'll stop.
Don't throw away a great opportunity
'cause of me.
It was one stupid kiss.
That's it.
There's nothing else between us.
Really?
You mean that?
There's nothing?
Of course I don't mean it.
I think about you all the time.
It's freakin' annoying.
But I'll get over it.
So don't quit 'cause of me.
I'll be normal again soon.
I promise.

We don't know each other.
I used to work for

My boyfriend's in the car.
I know you didn't kill Lila Stangard.
And we both know who did.
Help me catch him.
The trial's soon.
Mnh-mnh. You're not gonna solve anything tonight.
Turn it off.
Let's go to sleep.

I just got a call from my contact at the medical examiner's office.

They're ant bites.
Well, that's good news.

Previously on
"How to get away with Murder"...
A woman's body was found inside the Kappa Kappa Theta House.
- What's wrong?
- She was my friend, okay?
And ordering miss Stangard's body be exhumed immediately.
A full external and internal second autopsy.
I think about you all the time.
But I'll get over it.
What if I don't want you to get over it?
- We represent Mary Walker.
- This is a prenup.
I know you didn't kill Lila Stangard.
And we both know who did.
They missed something in the first autopsy.
Say it.
Lila was six weeks pregnant.
What if it's too big...
Like, I waited too long, and now my body assumes
I'm some sort of nun who'll never have sex, and then when I finally do it or... try...
- He won't fit?
- I've met Griffin.
Judging by the chip on his shoulder,
I'm guessing it'll fit.
What happened to your virginity pact?
Did Griffin finally realize God doesn't give a crap about his sex life?
If I tell you something, swear you won't tell anyone?
I'm hanging out with a sorority girl.
I don't want to tell anyone about this more than you.
I met a new guy.
Who?
Mr. Darcy.
I promised I wouldn't tell anyone who he was.
So he's one of Griffin's friends?
No.
Then why can't you tell me?
He has a wife.
My God.
Lila was six weeks pregnant.
I'll leave.
No. Stay.
Annie. Really.
I need a witness here to make sure you don't lie to me again.
You lied when you said you didn't sleep with her.
You lied when you said you were at Yale the night she was killed.
And I believed you, like some fool.
So...
Did you know she was pregnant?
No.
"No" because you didn't or "no" because if you say "yes," you know that's motive to kill?
This is... not something that...
Do not leave!
Are you lying?
No.
We don't even know if it's mine.
Who else's could it be...
Her virgin boyfriend?
He claims to be a virgin.
Was Lila?
The first time you had her?
You would know, wouldn't you?
I didn't know she was pregnant.
I promise you.
You believe him?
Should've worn a condom.
sometimes, we're not responsible for our own actions, because sometimes, we behave not like thinking, thoughtful human beings, but as animals.
Such is the case of Gretchen Thomas, a successful real-estate agent, wife, mother.
Like many a high-powered professional, stress and anxiety are part of her daily routine, so she takes a prescription sleeping pill before bed.
Its side effects have caused her to buy clothes online, cook gourmet meals, and even initiate sex with her husband all while completely unconscious.
And then this happened.
This is Ms. Thomas on her home-security system, dragging her nanny's dead, bloody body out of the house.
And then what does she do?
She begins to clean up the mess.
Now, we all know the feeling...
We've had a bad dream, we know we're asleep, but try as we might, we just can't seem to wake ourselves up.
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to get to your office.
It's Mia's 13th birthday this weekend, and planning has been crazy.
Who would've thought that it'd be so difficult to find a deejay?
We really need your undivided attention.
Finally!
Ricardo?
Hi. I am so happy that you called.
Now, I know you usually don't do kids' parties, but I'm going to prison any minute,
- this could take a while.
- And this could be the last chance
- want to sneak upstairs?
- My daughter and I could be together.
No, no.
I'm sure dj rizzles is very talented.
It's just that you have come so highly recommended from my friend Karen's...
You're on trial for first-degree murder.
Put the phone down so we can prep for your testimony.
I've changed my mind.
I don't want to take the stand.
Honey, this isn't just your decision.
You have a family who needs you, children who need you.
If she wants to go to jail, dad, let her.
Your mother is not going to jail, Cody.
Gretchen,
I understand this is difficult for you, but as your attorney,
I need to put you on the stand so I can establish that you had no motive to kill Elke.
 The jury needs to believe that you two were close.
 We were close.
Can you imagine waking up to realize that you killed somebody you loved?
That's what I did.
And I'm sorry.
If the jury thinks that
I should go to prison,
I agree.
I should pay for this sin.
Since we can't put Gretchen on the stand, we're having the people who love her...
Her family...
Testify to her history of sleepwalking.
So tomorrow, each of you will act as prosecutors, prepping each of the Thomases for their moment in the sun.
Dig in.
Anyone else feel like we do all her work for her?
Just figuring that out now?
I was fine with it before exams, but now that everyone else in our class is locked away in their apartments, studying, we're falling behind, working as free labor.
You know who doesn't care about exams?
This guy. 'Cause I got...
Mention the trophy again, and I'll bash your face in with it.
Okay, whatever, shooting star.
You guys all go be boring, study.
I'll be at the bonfire, partying it up, mackin' on the chickadees!
Hey.
You want to study-group this weekend?
Since when do you need to study?
Well, you take notes, I have Adderall.
We'll make a great team.
Wes.
Professor Keating wants to see you.
Hey.
You want to join waitlist and I in our new study group?
Pregnant?
Six weeks.
There was no sign of sexual trauma in the first autopsy, so they didn't inspect the uterus.
It'll be a few more days before the police release the final report, but the minute they do, they'll run a DNA test on Griffin to see if he was the father.
He's not, as we both know.
It's good for Rebecca's case.
But I would appreciate it if you didn't tell her.
Why not?
Well, because if she finds out days before her trial,
I'm afraid she'll act out in a way that will hurt her case.
So, for her benefit,
I'm asking you not to tell her.
If you didn't want her to know, why tell me?
Because I learned my lesson about keeping secrets from you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Lila was pregnant.
You didn't know?
No.
It's Sam's?
Yeah, probably.
Annalise asked me not to tell you.
What?
I know.
Said she didn't want to upset you.
What... you believe her, with her husband freakin' involved?
I'm not sure.
But...
She knows I could go to the police at any point.
So let's. We'll tell them the baby's Sam's.
What if it's not?
They still have to question him.
Well, what if he has an alibi?
Or they release him?
You're still on trial, but without Annalise.
She'd quit your case.
So, what?
I mean, we... we do nothing?
Of course not.
I...
I just need to keep an eye on her till we figure out our next step.
It's not safe to be out here alone.
Why should I trust you?
I want to get acquitted, but you...
Why do you want to help me?
I lost my job because of this case.
So, really, this is just me helping myself.
So...
What do you want to tell me?
Lila... was pregnant.
That's the evidence we need, right?
To tie Sam to her?
You still have access to the house?
Yeah.
Grab a sample of his hair from the bathroom.
I'll have someone at the station run a DNA test.
If it matches the baby, they're gonna have to start an investigation on him.
And your case... will go away.
You in?
Hey, loser.
All right, some coke, some molly.
What?
We did it.
I'm guessing it didn't hurt, by the look on your face.
It's not like how all my friends talk about their first time.
You know, he... didn't rush or act weird or make me feel weird.
He made me feel safe.
You think I'm an idiot.
You said it.
Well, I will say this...
His wife must never put out, because once we really started going, it was like he couldn't get enough of me.
Swear you won't tell anyone?
Like I care enough about your stupid sex life to tell anyone.
Thanks.
- My God.
- What?
Wow. Well...
Now I know why you thought it'd hurt.
Ooh!
What's up, Darcy?
Annalise isn't here.
Court... I know. Wes told me.
I think I left my gloves here...
Greenish, 10 fingers.
Not gonna steal anything.
'Course not.
Must've fallen out... somewhere.
Not here.
I'm a disaster. I lose everything I like.
Can I use your bathroom?
Rebecca.
You should go.
Dude, I'm not...
You're welcome here when
Annalise invites you.
Otherwise, this is my house.
And I'm asking you to leave.
Yeah.
Nice to see you, too.
It was a bloodbath...
A whole trail of it leading outside.
And mom just stood there, hosing the blood off elke.
So your mom was awake when you found her?
No. She was asleep.
I started yelling for my dad.
So, let's be clear...
You actually saw her take the sleeping pill that night?
No, but she told me she took it when we got into bed.
Then how can you be certain?
Because she took it every night...
Right before we went to sleep.
Like a drug addict.
I told her,
"You wouldn't need a pill to sleep
"if you just slowed down.
Stop trying to do so much."
Sounds like the perfect recipe for your daughter to snap...
Maybe even kill.
Objection... argumentative.
What are you doing?
You didn't ask an actual question.
The opposing lawyer would have no choice but to object.
I watch court TV.
Grandma hated Elke.
She felt like mom should be our mom, not some Scandinavian milkmaid.
Don't say that part on the stand.
We don't want anyone to think your grandmother had anything to do with it.
Maybe she did.
I'm kidding.
Look in the medicine cabinet in their bathroom.
It's a veritable drugstore in there...
Antianxiety meds for Mia, hair-growth supplements for Matthew.
Does that mean you don't trust your daughter's judgment?
Of course I trust her.
Then act like it.
Show a sliver of doubt or distrust, and the prosecution will pounce.
On top of me, initiating sex.
All the while, she's completely asleep.
That's how much those pills knock her out.
Maybe don't...
Use the sex as an example on the stand.
When did your mom finally come to?
Once my dad put her in the shower, ran cold water on her.
It was the only way we could wake her up.
What was her reaction when she realized what she'd done?
She started crying, yelling.
It was awful... for all of us.
Like, it's one thing for your mom to kill your nanny...
It's a whole other thing if she had no idea what she was doing.
It sounds fake... I know...
Like we're making it up, but we're not.
It's the pill's fault.
Your witness.
Is it possible your parents told you to lie on the stand today, Cody?
Your Honor, there's no good-faith basis to this question.
Let me rephrase.
Do you love your mother?
Yes.
So you'd do anything to protect her.
Lie, even?
He's badgering my witness, Your Honor.
Lying under oath is illegal, Cody.
Mr. Rodriguez, this is bordering on witness intimidation.
- Are you lying, Cody?
- Your Honor, I ask the court to cite the prosecutor for misconduct and allow my witness to leave the stand.
I'm not lying about my mother.
She loved elke. We all did.
Especially me.
What did you just say?
Your Honor, he's just a young boy.
I loved her.
That's why I was awake at
3:00 A.M. that night...
Because I was going to her room, just like I had been every night.
We loved each other.
Damn it, Aiden!
You want me to write a script for you?
How about, "Mother,
"you should've told me you were giving Michaela a prenup,
"and as her fiancÃ©,
I fully support her decision not to sign it."
I got to go.
Are you good for anything, or can you only do your job when you're screwing evidence out of someone?
Annalise, he did his best. We were all blindsided by this.
No, you were blindsided.
Because you can't do your one simple job.
Tell me what's coming my way!
That's all I ask.
And in return,
I tolerate your pathetic, mousy presence in my house.
Hey.
How's it feel to have your ass handed to you just days before she hands out our final grades?
I'm not worried, because I got a copy of the exam that she gave last year.
And I'm happy to share it with my new study group if they have things to give me in return.
I'll trade you all my notes.
And I'll give you copies of all of kan's old outlines.
I have every criminal-law hornbook ever written.
I think three people's enough for this study group. my God. This is so good.
Hello?
You like the photo?
I snuck it while you were in the shower this morning.
Wes was sitting right next to me.
He could've seen it.
I know.
Makes it more fun.
What do you want?
What do you think?
Slow down, killer.
If I'm gone for more than a few minutes,
Bonnie will get suspicious.
Bonnie was born suspicious.
I want to take my time.
? Just for the thrill ?
Hey, that was bull donks, yo.
A.K. reaming you out like that...
It's not right.
I mean, we all know who deserves the credit around here.
You're sucking up. Stop it.
No, I'm just saying don't let it get to you.
She's the one that sucks, not you.
Also, I'm having a little jammy-jam at my place tomorrow before the bonfire.
Drinks, pretty peeps... the ushe.
So I was hoping I could get off a little early tomorrow.
You can come, too...
Shake your groove thang.
You know what I'm saying?
You can go home early as long as you get all your work done.
Sam.
I can't talk right now.
It's about Lila.
The night she was killed,
I thought you were at Yale.
But I...
Did you need me?
No.
Rebecca came by the house.
Claims she was looking for her gloves.
There's not a chance she knows about the pregnancy?
Wes is here all the time.
I already told Wes.
So he told her.
We don't know that.
Annie, you've seen the two of them.
You know how he feels about her.
Yeah.
That's sweet, isn't it?
Tell me what you want me to do here...
If you want me to go to the police.
Just...
Don't give up on me here.
I'm gonna lose my case.
Because all I can think about is you with that girl.
How many times was it?
Seven?
That's all it took for you to knock her up?
This is what I get.
This is what happens when you screw somebody else's husband.
You become sad, barren.
And even a dead girl is more of a woman than you.
That's not what this is.
It is.
No.
No, Annie, this...
This is me.
So...
Get pissed off, hit me if that's what it takes.
But I broke us, not you.
And I'll do whatever it takes to make us right again.
So...
Either I'm already high or school started again,
'cause I swear I just walked by a bunch of girls half-naked downstairs, practicing a miley Cyrus dance routine.
What happened?
Darcy wants to end it.
I know I shouldn't be surprised.
They never leave their wives.
But you hoped he would.
Tell me it's better this way.
Griffin still hasn't found out.
I can just...
You said you were breaking up with Griffin.
Lila, he's a Jesus-obsessed control freak who forced you into a virginity pact.
He was right.
Bad things happen when you have sex.
Like what?
I-I don't know.
Just, let's not talk about it.
Um, yeah, okay.
I'll go.
No.
Stay.
Is it sick if all I want to do is go over to his house and show his wife all the pictures of his junk on my phone?
No.
That is normal.
But don't do that.
I know.
Hey, it's me.
- You get it? 
- No, he got all suspicious.
I think I have a better idea.
Sam texted Lila all the time.
There's got to be evidence on his phone still, right?
What do you want?
Just thought I'd...
Come see how you're doing.
What... you didn't hear enough on the stand?
You know, when I was your age, my sister had this friend Marissa, and she was my first.
I was 14, she was 18.
And... I don't know.
I-I thought it was probably too good to last, but I hung on 'cause she was hot.
And after a while...
Marissa just... she stopped coming by.
I was pissed.
Like, really... really angry.
And I'd always think up ways to hurt her if I saw her again.
But I mean... Really hurt her. You know?
Dude, I know you're gay.
And I didn't kill Elke.
I loved her.
She loved me.
Now, if I'm on a jury, I...
I think that story's too good to be true.
I mean, no relationship is that perfect.
I never said it was perfect.
How'd the treasure hunt go?
All I came up with was a flaming penis.
Is that some sort of gay euphemism?
No.
Elke gave Cody an std...
Tricha... mania or something.
Just the sound of that hurts my ween.
Do you mean trichomoniasis?
Yeah. What... you have it?
I majored premed in undergrad.
I still remember everything...
Including that there's a specific antibiotic that treats trichomoniasis.
Tinidazole. I knew it.
Knew what?
That I just won our case for us.
Good luck with your little study group.
Just tell me... what'd you figure out?
Why ruin the suspense?
Mr. Thomas, what happened if your wife ever drank a glass of wine before taking her sleeping pill?
Then she was pretty much impossible to wake.
I'd have to just let her sleep it off, which is why Gretchen doesn't usually drink.
But she did the night Elke was murdered?
It was a... special occasion.
Gretchen had just sold another house.
We celebrated at dinner.
Anything else happen that day?
You mean the murder?
No, I mean what your son, Cody, told you.
I'm sorry?
Mr. Thomas, on the day Elke was killed, didn't your son, Cody, tell you that he was experiencing some painful urination?
Well... yes, but I-I had...
And when he told you, did you not think back to when you had experienced the same painful urination?
How is this relevant, Your Honor?
Medical records show that
Mr. Thomas was taking the prescription tinidazole, which is a prescription used specifically to treat trichomoniasis.
See what happens when you use your brain instead of your penis?
That drug was for Cody, not for me.
Wrong... you were prescribed that drug three months before Cody came to you.
Because the truth is, you needed your own because you, too, were taking part in a sexual affair with Elke.
And when your son came to you, he revealed that he was also sleeping with her...
A woman you thought solely was yours...
- And you became jealous. 
- This is ridiculous.
At dinner that night, didn't you open a bottle of wine, even encourage your wife to have a glass to celebrate her new sale?
It was a really big commission.
No, you needed her to  stay out of it that night so you can go into Elke's room and stab her to death.
- That is... no! - Then you got your drugged, type-a wife out of bed, showed her the bloody, terrible mess you made, knowing full well that she would try and clean it up.
I'm so sorry.
It's too late for apologies, Mr. Thomas.
The defense rests.
You animal.
I hired you to defend me, not destroy my family.
That burn you feel right now is not because of what I did...
It's because of what he did.
He lied to you, betrayed you, took advantage of your loyalty and trust.
And that's unforgivable.
You'll thank me one day.
Professor Keating, since I helped in the case today,
I was thinking...
There's nothing barring you from taking the trophy from
Asher and awarding it to me.
I thought you had the trophy.
No, but the fact that you're saying that means you think I deserve it, which I do.
I don't care who has the trophy,
Ms. Pratt...
You, Mr. Millstone.
It really doesn't matter.
Of course it matters.
You built our entire semester on it.
Winning it, t-that means you're at the top of the class,
- that...
- Michaela.
You have a visitor.
Mrs. Walker.
What are you doing here?
I thought it best to talk in person...
Bring the Mountain to Mohammed, as they say.
Or do you not have time for your future mother-in-law?
Typical middleton behavior?
There's a bonfire for the football team tonight.
Sports-driven university.
Lovely.
I know why you're here.
And while I realize a prenup is a delicate subject...
Now, there is nothing delicate about this.
This is not emotional. This is business.
Actually, this is about my marriage to Aiden, so... not business.
My husband and I built our company from the ground up.
The first store eventually became 10,
10 became 50, and now we run a multinational corporation.
And while Aiden has decided to pursue a political career...
Which makes Robert and me very happy...
This legacy will still belong to him.
So you understand why we will not allow you to waltz in and reap the benefits.
I'm not marrying Aiden for his money.
I'm marrying him because I love him.
Well, that's a beautiful sentiment.
But it's not one that I'll bet my life's work on.
I'm not signing the prenup.
And it's not because I want to take anyone's money, but because I plan on staying married to Aiden for the rest of my life.
That's how seriously I take this commitment.
Either sign...
Or I cancel the wedding.
You sign, or I will make sure that you go back to that nasty, backwood, bayou swamp you came from, you stubborn bitch!
You want to play?
Let's go.
At least I know I was right about you now.
? No fun ?
? home, I'm all alone ?
Hurry.
I have a study group.
? Locked down, comfortable numb ?
? wrapped up, comatose, ?
? sittin' in the tub ?
Hi, there.
What are you doing here?
Well, the firm gave me a few days off, and... thought I would surprise you.
Looks like I did.
Who is this?
Sasha... his girlfriend.
And you must be...
The student of the month?
What is it?
I met Lila the night she was killed.
I need to see Annalise Keating.
Is this about Frank?
I don't know who Frank is.
Is Annalise in there?
Do you need a lawyer?
You can talk to me.
No. I just need to talk to Annalise.
Tell her it's about her husband.
She's not here.
That's her car, isn't it?
Annalise!
Listen.
I don't know who you are or what you think you're doing, but I guarantee you're going to regret this.
So just take a deep breath, calm down, and go home.
Leave, or I call 911.
Fine.
But tell her I came to tell her something important.
He can't keep it a secret anymore.
She was talking about the pregnancy, right?
That was the secret?
Which means... you knew.
Sam.
Please. This isn't Annalise asking.
This is me.
What good would it do to tell her now?
I didn't hurt that girl. I swear.
But we both know how much this would devastate Annie.
Bon...
You've always had my back.
But I need you now more than ever.
I didn't know who she was...
Not until the fliers went up.
And I thought Sam was at Yale that night.
I thought you two were working through things, so I didn't think...
I'm so sorry.
I just...
Didn't know what good it would do to tell you.
And I didn't believe that he could do such a thing...
That he could hurt her.
He knew she was pregnant.
He told you that?
He kissed me...
So I'd lie to you.
He thought he was finally giving me what I wanted...
But...
He's not a good man, Annalise.
You're fired.
No.
Please.
Annalise.
Leave.
And don't come back.
Plug it into his computer.
It'll download all his phone information, including the coordinates where he was that night.
Well, what if he cleared his phone?
Doesn't matter.
If he backed it up before that, computer's storing what we need.
Tell me now if you want to bail.
Nope.
I'll call you when I get it.
I-I was just trying to do the right thing, for once.
You've done everything for me, risked everything.
I-I didn't want to hurt you or mess up your life any more than I already have.
- When he came to me, I thought...
- Her boyfriend!
I didn't know he was her boyfriend!
I would've told you if you just trusted me.
I do trust you.
Do you?
Because this...
She's setting us up.
You do get that?
Annalise doesn't do anything without some sort of plan.
So her telling me Lila's pregnant, then sending her boyfriend?
Now she knows I lied to her.
You should've told me.
I said I'm sorry.
I tell you everything...
Things no one knows about me.
I know.
You just went behind my back like it's nothing.
I'm being honest now.
It's hard for me to believe that.
Waitlist! Open up!
Dude.
You should've told me you live in the ghetto.
Could've met at my place.
Am I... interrupting something?
Nope. I was just leaving.
Bitches be crazy.
Hey, girl. You like to dance?
Hey, yo.
Michaela.
Hey.
You're at... my place right now.
Yeah, my brain's too fried to get any studying done tonight.
So... where is everyone?
Not here yet.
Well, um...
At least get me a drink.
Sure.
I'm thinking no one's showed yet because people know the bonfire goes all night.
People want to be pacing themselves, you know?
Of course.
This bonfire's been going on for over 100 years, though.
It's only been canceled twice...
Once for, pearl harbor, and then once for some flu pandemic.
But tonight...
Tonight is gonna be a heezy, fo' sheezy...
Rebecca, let me in!
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
Are you crying?
No, it's just... really cold outside.
Rebecca!
Wes, how do you even know she's inside?
I mean, maybe she just turned on music to throw you off.
She took it.
Took what?
Did you bring your car?
It's unorthodox, I know.
Who knows what we'll find?
But for the family's sake, it's important we get at the truth one way or another.
Thank you.
Who was that?
The DA's office.
Since Lila was pregnant,
I'm demanding that they collect DNA samples of all the men in her life...
Including her teachers. sync and corrections by <font color="##FF0000">dreaMaker7</font> www.addic7ed.com

## S01E9

- Previously on "How to get away with Murder"...
-  Mrs. Walker.
Do you have time for  your future mother-in-law?
I'm not signing the prenup.
You stubborn bitch!
- Michaela.
- Hey.
Tonight is gonna be the heezy, fo' sheezy...
Hi, there.
Who is this?
Sasha... His girlfriend.
I know you didn't kill Lila Stangard.
And we both know who did...
Help me catch him.
Lila was pregnant.
That's the evidence we need to tie Sam to her?
Plug it into his computer.
It'll download all his phone information.
She took it. Did you bring your car?
He kissed me... So I'd lie to you.
He knew she was pregnant.
You're fired.
No.
Since Lila was pregnant,
I'm demanding that they collect
DNA samples of all the men in her life...
Including her teachers.
I know nothing... About you, us.
Why are you doing this?
You knew she was pregnant.
How stupid could you be? Bonnie?
Of course she'd tell me.
All right, just...
Annie, wait.
I lied, yes, but only because I was afraid you'd think I killed her.
- Didn't you?
- No. God, no.
Annie, please. J...
You lie so much,
- your words mean nothing to me.
You mean nothing to me.
Will you just stop for one second?!
No! I'm done saving your ass!
I'm done believing in you!
I'm done loving you! Get out of this house!
I am begging you... Do not give up on me.
- I already have.
- I'm your husband. I love you.
Get out of this house, or I'm gonna call 911!
I am not leaving until you talk to me!
If one of these idiots touches my car,
I'm gonna run them over.
It's Rebecca. Don't leave me a message.
Still not picking up?
Hey, how do you know that she's even at Annalise's?
I mean, maybe she got hungry or went to score some drugs.
She went there.
I know that that's what you keep saying, but I'm suggesting otherwise.
I mean, even if she's there, what does it matter?
- We have to study. 
- The exam...
Sam killed Lila, okay?
That's why she's going over there.
She's trying to prove it.
I'm not a violent man, Annie.
Everyone's violent given the chance.
No. Not me. You know that.
I tried to believe you this whole time.
Just calm down. I didn't listen to myself.
I am still the man you married.
You are not that man anymore!
And I don't think you ever were, which is why you chose me, isn't it?
I've been the window dressing for you...
The black woman on your arm so you can hide, so that people only saw the good guy.
And maybe it took me 20 years to see it, but I do now... I see it!
And that's why you killed Lila...
Because she was pregnant, and you knew that if it got out, people would see you for the pathetic man you are!
If you think I killed her, why not just go to the police?
Why get them to run a DNA test instead?
It's so you can cover your own ass, because that's who you are...
Some scared little girl who pretends to be strong but is really just weak and selfish.
I did everything I could to protect you!
You've done nothing but make my life miserable!
I've been screwing another man.
Wait. You're serious?
This isn't a-a joke?
I don't care if you believe me.
Just drive faster.
Are you hearing this? I mean...
Why would Annalise defend Rebecca if she thought Sam was involved?
Because I said I'd go to the police if she didn't.
Right.
You blackmailed Annalise.
The kid that was so scared that he almost crapped his pants on the first day of class.
- This is ridiculous. 
- Connor, shut up.
You think Sam killed Lila?
Yes.
This night just gets better and better.
His name is Nate.
And, boy, is he good to me.
He knows me...
Just what I like and how I like it.
He knows how to make me scream and groan and sweat.
And so I let him take me wherever he wants...
- On this counter, on my desk, in our bed.
- You hypocrite.
- Just thinking about him right now makes me...
- Shaming me for cheating all this time.
Which is how I could sleep with you all these months, because I would think about him and I'd be able to stand you on top of me!
And I think of Lila every time
I try to get off with you!
I bet you did. Killing her?
You enjoyed it, didn't you? Strangling her?
Feeling the life go out of her body?
You still think about it, don't you?
Your hand around her neck while you were still inside of her.
It's exciting you right now, isn't it?
Remembering it?
You want to do it to me now, don't you?
Go ahead. Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me!
You're a monster.
"Monster," Is that all you got?
You can do better than that.
You want the truth?
You're nothing but a piece of ass.
That's what I saw when I first talked to you in the office that day...
'Cause I knew you'd put out.
That's all you're really good for...
Dirty, rough sex that I'm too ashamed to tell anyone about.
That's how foul you are, you disgusting slut.
Well...
At least you were finally able to tell the truth. sync and corrections by <font color="##FF0000">dreaMaker7</font> www.addic7ed.com
Hi. Mr. Keating.
- What do you want?
- Is Professor Keating around?
She's not here.
Any idea when she'll be back?
No. You should... You should go.
I'll just wait, if I can.
I really need to turn this in to get out of our exam.
Just leave it on her desk.
See, that's the thing.
It's, um, it's a little more  complicated than that.
Rebecca?
What is this?
Why are you both here?
I'm just here to turn in the trophy.
Is... something wrong?
Call Wes.
Unlock the door, Rebecca.
Michaela?
Whoa, whoa. Michaela, slow down.
Who's fighting?
- Rebecca and Sam. I think he's drunk.
- Quit playing around and open the door.
- Is Annalise there?
- No!
And Rebecca's locked herself inside their bedroom.
What are you doing in there?
What the hell is this?!
Sam killed Lila, and Rebecca's trying to prove it.
- Open the door, Rebecca.
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait. What?
I'd pay to see her face right now.
No. What did you just say?
You can't leave her alone with him.
Promise me you won't leave.
- Come out, or I'm calling the police.
- My God!
What's he doing?
I... I...
- Open the door, Rebecca!
- H-he's just screaming.
- Michaela, talk to me.
- My God. My God.
Y-you need to get here.
This is bad. Connor, go. Go.
Really, really bad.
I said open the damn door!
What's happening?
My God!
- My God! My God! My God!
My God! - Michaela! Answer me!
- Michaela! - You have to get here right now! You have to get here right now!
Please, Mr. Keating, stop!
If you just calm down, we can figure this out.
Come out or I'm coming in!
Stop!
Get out of my house.
Let her go, then we'll leave.
She took my computer.
What the hell is she trying to get?
I don't know.
Just... calm down, and we'll leave.
Rebecca, it's me. You can come out now.
Give me a minute.
Okay, I'm coming.
Good.
I'm here.
- What did you do?
- Nothing.
I didn't find anything.
We'll leave now.
Just let us go.
I'm not gonna do anything.
My God!
Get off!
Grab it!
Laurel!
Aah!
Aaaaah!
Aaaah!
God. God, no.
We need to call an ambulance.
Why? He's dead.
You killed him, Michaela.
Me? H-he was coming at us.
Yeah, and he was alive, until you shoved him over the railing.
I was protecting Laurel.
She was.
Fine. Then you both killed him.
So did you, then.
No, no, no. I didn't do anything.
It doesn't matter what any of us did.
We were all here, which means we're all at fault.
What are you talking about?
Rebecca was stealing private information off of Sam's computer.
That's a felony.
And because we were all helping her,
- we could be charged with felony murder.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no prosecutor would do that.
We were defending ourselves.
We broke into his house.
He was defending himself.
- I was just trying to turn in the trophy.
- What?
I wasn't part of your plan is all, so I...
There was no plan, okay? That was all her.
I didn't ask for anyone's help.
Fine. Then we can thank your boyfriend for that.
Shouldn't we be calling the ambulance?
I think you mean the police, idiot.
He's dead!
Fine. Then the police.
But we can't just sit here and do nothing.
No. Think.
No one knows we were here.
Annalise could be home any minute.
Which is why we should leave.
You want to run?
I'm just saying... he fell after drinking too much.
My car is outside. Anyone could've seen it.
Your car's here all of the time.
No, we should call the police and tell them everything.
- But Rebecca can't afford to...
- I don't care about Rebecca right now!
I care about my future!
But you did this!
Just like we all did.
He's dead because of all of us.
And maybe that's okay.
He killed Lila and was gonna let Rebecca go down for it.
It's not...
My God!
Do something!
- Get him off her!
-  Do something!!
He's dead. He's dead.
We have to go... Right now.
He's dead. He's dead. He's dead.
You okay?
We need to clean you up and get out of here.
Okay.
Get ready to leave.
Where are you going?
Wes! Hurry the hell up!
Come on.
What?
Thank you.
It's gonna be fine.
Michaela, we need to leave now.
Just need to stand up, okay?
Here's what we do.
You guys take Michaela to the woods.
I'll get Rebecca out of here.
Wait. What... you just...
You're gonna leave?
She can't be here. You know that.
We're so screwed.
It's gonna be fine.
You're gonna have to trust me right now.
Hey! Are you guys in there?!
Who is that?
Asher.
I see your car in the driveway, Connor!
Open up the damn door!
Okay, what is he doing here?
Everyone, get down.
Connor.
Are you bitches seriously trying to ignore me right now?!
Let me in!
And you guys call me immature?
I'm, like, the most grown-up grown-up ever compared to your dumb asses!
We should just let him in.
If he's been in the house, he'll...
He'll suddenly be a part of it, you know?
The five of us have witnessed him here.
Then daddy Millstone can help get us off.
We could get him to step in the blood.
It's not a bad idea.
- Yeah.
- No! He wasn't part of this.
Do you think that I wanted to be a part of this?
Wait. Listen.
He's gone.
Screw it.
And in other news, the d.A.'S office
has elected to institute a voluntary DNA dragnet,
looking for samples
from men connected to murder victim Lila Stangard..
They are trying to find the man responsible
for impregnating her before her death.
It's crazy, right?
First they think it's the boyfriend and the bartender.
Then they think it's her secret lover.
I'm just relieved
I didn't know the girl.
I don't want no police keeping my DNA on file.
You've got secrets to hide?
Investigators tell us they expect full cooperation...
Don't we all?
? Always killing me, killing me slowly ?
? Wanna wash those smiles away ?
? I walk with the noise ?
? it's reaching out to me ?
? I talk to the walls ?
? face my devils ?
? when I'm losing my touch ?
Don't do anything until I'm back.
Okay?
He wanted to kill me.
I had no other choice.
No.
I had to kill him, or he was gonna kill me.
- I saw the trophy sitting there.
- No.
- I hit him in the head. He deserved to die.
- Why are you saying this?
- And I'm glad he's dead.
- Stop it.
- Stop it!
- No!
Look, my trial's in a couple days.
I'm already going to jail.
And now you might, too, because of me, and I will kill myself if that happens.
So, please... please just let me help you for once.
The only thing you can do to help right now is stay in this room and not leave.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Do something.
- Get him off her!
- Do something!!
Hey! Asshat!
Sometime this year, will ya?
I'm so sorry.
What if they got caught or went to the police or she convinced him to pin it on us?
Wes wouldn't do that.
Think about it.
How we got here... It's all her fault.
It's not her fault.
Stop acting like a little bitch baby.
Do not tell me how to feel right now!
- Hey!
- Aah!
Sorry it took so long.
I went back for this.
Now, you... You take that back right now!
No. It's smart.
Commonwealth v. Deloatche...
A case the prosecution should've won but lost because there was no murder weapon.
- So, what are you saying?
- We clean it and we put it back.
Hide it in plain sight.
After we bury the body.
No. Absolutely not.
Yeah,
I-I-I-I'm with Michaela.
No, Connor, think.
The trophy, we need, yes, but the body stays where it is.
No, the body is what gets us caught.
You are not thinking straight.
What do you suggest?
Something that doesn't involve carrying a body across campus on the busiest night of the year!
She's right, Laurel.
Even if we get it out of the house unseen, the ground is frozen!
We have all night to dig.
You don't know what you're talking about!
This is murder!
None of us know what we're talking about!
I know I can't be here, but I-I-I didn't know where else to go.
I went to the police station.
I wanted to tell them everything, but...
The hell are you talking about?
Everything's falling apart.
Can you come outside?
Nia's back in the hospital.
You coming in or what?
Heads, we get the body.
Tails, we leave it where it is. Okay?
Heads.
We go back for the body.
You were right.
I think Sam killed Lila.
Why are you saying that?
He lied...
About everything.
Lila was pregnant, and he knew.
He knew.
You tell anyone?
Just you.
I told the D.A. to run a DNA test on all the men in her life, her teachers...
That's good.
You did the right thing.
- Did I?
- Annalise, come on.
I mean, if they find out that he hurt her, that I did all those things to help him... illegal things...
I mean, I should've listened to you.
I should've... left him.
Instead, I tried to protect him.
He's your husband. He messed with your head.
We would've all done the same thing.
Not you.
Please.
A body doesn't just burn.
You need an incinerator.
But at least we'll get rid of our DNA.
And the bonfire will cover the smoke.
It's... it's kind of a perfect plan.
- Perfect?
- The bonfire.
There is nothing perfect about this plan.
You guys...
Cry all you want.
I'm now on board with the plan.
- Listen to me!
- What?! What?!
The bonfire... That's our alibi.
So, what's the plan here?
Are we gonna chop him up into bbq-friendly pieces now, or are we gonna wait till he's broiled to a crisp?
We'll roll him in the rug, deal with it in the woods.
Good times.
Little help?
Happy to.
You are not about to call Aiden!
No.
You sure about that?
If you call him, the cell tower will place you in this house.
I know, okay? I'm not stupid.
Look, I-I'm not gonna call him.
Can I please just have my...
This is scary. I know.
And believe it or not, I know you...
How much you like to be in control.
But right now, you need to accept that this situation isn't one we can control.
So we just need to switch off our brains and go along with the plan.
Can you do that?
Yeah.
And don't talk to me like I'm a child.
I should go.
Where?
I don't know.
To a hotel.
Don't worry. I won't go back there.
You're too upset to go anywhere.
Stay until you calm down.
No, Nate.
Annalise,
I'm telling you it's okay.
It's okay.
? A thousand voices howling in my head ?
? Speak in tongues ? fine.
? I don't even recognize your face ?
? Mirror on the wall ?
? Tell me all the ways to stay away ?
So...
You said you're in dental-equipment sales?
You smell so good.
Yo, yo, yo.
It's Bonnie.
Is your party still happening?
It was kind of a bust, actually.
Why?
I don't know.
I was... thinking I could swing by, maybe.
Wait... really? You want to come over?
My God. My God. My God.
If that's okay with you.
Yeah. Totally.
I'll... I'll be there in 20.
Yes!
? You should save your eyes ?
you've reached Sam Keating.
Please leave a message.
No answer?
No.
It's probably better that way.
Are we terrible people?
I don't know.
Depends on who you ask.
? Mirror on the wall ?
Nate...
This isn't...
? Tell me all the ways to stay away ?
? ay, ay, ay,
? away, ay, ?
? away, ay, ahhhhh ?
? I'm hearing voices all the time up in my mind ?
? I'm hearing voices, and they're haunting my mind ?
So, can I get you a... drink?
Mnh-mnh.
I've had enough, I think.
Rough night?
Wanna... Talk about it?
No.
Why don't you sit down?
You're pretty wasted right now.
I don't think we should...
Really... you know...
I'm a grown-ass woman.
I might be drunk, but I know what I want when I want it.
So get over here.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
It's fine. It's fine.
One second.
Just come here, you idiot!
Take your pants off!
All right.
You've reached Sam Keating.
Please leave a message.
Sam, it's me.
I didn't think that you would pick up.
What was that?
Still, there's so much I need to say to you in person and not by phone, but I guess this will have to do.
Why is Frank calling you?
What?
I saw your phone, Laurel.
What the hell's going on?
We've built a life together, Sam...
20 years.
Okay. Last chance.
Either we all agree or we stop right now.
Just do it.
Before the bonfire ends.
Michaela?
It's the only way to destroy the DNA.
Whatever we've said to each other, all the horrible things...
I'll do whatever I can to make this right.
I'll do anything.
It's too late.
We've seen each other through so much...
Everything good and bad in our lives.
Hey, guys.
I think I just detached the tibia.
Or... is that a fibula?
So much pain.
So much happiness.
It's a rare thing to know someone that well and to bear witness to so much in someone's life.
Here.
So I'm asking you right now... no.
Begging.
M-m-m-m-my ring.
What?
M-my engagement ring is gone!
Please forgive me for what I said.
I didn't mean any of it, and I know you didn't, either.
Are you sure you had the ring on when we left the house?
I already told you... Yes!
I don't want things to end this way.
My God.
What if we don't find it?
I guess you'll just have to cancel the wedding.
Stop!
We still need her to return the trophy to Asher's.
There is no way she can do that.
Look at her.
No.
We all had to do things tonight that we didn't want to do.
This one is on her.
I'll do it.
I want us to work through this.
I want us to be together.
I said wait!
My ring might be in one of those!
Enough about the ring, Frodo!
We are not going through every bag.
I'm telling you, this is a bad idea.
Because whatever you did...
You're not listening.
Whatever the truth is...
We need to get to an incinerator and find...
I heard you!
All night.
I'm sorry, but you've been outvoted on this one.
Aah! God! God!
Grow up!
That's it.
There's no more.
Same time next week?
Can we please just go?
...I will stay by your side through all of it, no matter what.
Train's leaving, waitlist. You coming?
Because I'm your wife.
And I love you, and I need you.
So please come home, Sam.
Come home so we can be together.
Come home.
Rebecca?
You in there?
Morning.
Where'd you go?
Okay, well, let's see.
I have a bagful of bagels  and two coffees, so...
Where's the thumb drive?
It's right here.
What are you doing?
Why the hell did you do that?!
Because we can't use it.
Are you crazy?
This is what proves that Sam killed Lila.
It also proves we were at his house last night.
So, what? This was all for nothing?
Don't think about that.
I screwed up,
Oliver.
I screwed up so bad.
I screwed up. I scr... I screwed up.
I screwed up.
I screwed up. I screwed up.
It's gonna be okay.
It isn't. No, it isn't. It isn't.
It will be.
Come inside...
And tell me everything.
I need your help.
I stole it from Asher.
I've been really stressed...
About exams and us.
I still haven't broken up with kan, and when I found out you had a girlfriend...
Ex-girlfriend.
Whatever. I stole it, and it was dumb.
I just don't want people to think that I'm the shooting star, so I can't have it, and Asher can't know that I took it.
That's the really bad thing you wanted to tell me?
It's stupid. I know.
I'll take care of it.
Those fricking liars.
First they steal my trophy, then they go party at the bonfire after making fun of me for wanting to go in the first place.
You know you can't tell them about this.
This never happened. You understand?
Of course.
I'd never be that guy.
Do you think it could
not happen one more time?
Hey.
Are you with him?
What?
Do not lie to me right now!
I don't know who you're talking about.
Sam! Are you with Sam?
No. No.
Why? What's wrong?
Something terrible's happened.
We fought last night after you left, and I told him that the D.A. was gonna find out that the baby was his.
I'm worried, Bonnie.
He thinks he's gonna go away for murder and now he's not answering his phone, and I'm...
What if he's done something stupid?
Stay where you are.
I will be right over.
Please hurry.
Of course.
Who's that?
I have to get to the office.
Do you need a ride?
We could get breakfast on our way.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Mrs. Walker.
You have got to be kidding.
Please let me explain.
You must take me for some new kind of fool.
I'm the fool, and I came  here to tell you woman-to-woman that I am so sorry for my behavior last night.
I am not that girl, but with final exams and Professor Keating relying so heavily on me and wanting to plan the perfect wedding,
I-I just haven't been myself.
I want to assure you that such an absurd reaction will never, ever happen again.
Which is why I want to give you this.
Feel better?
Yeah.
Good. 'Cause we need to talk.
Right.
So...
You said you'd tell me after you showered.
What the hell happened last night?
I was high.
What?
I don't know what I took. I just...
I was mixing a bunch of stuff...
Some pills and... this new stuff
I'd never tried before.
I thought you didn't do drugs.
I lied.
I have a drug problem, Oliver.
Who's that?
Bonnie.
What does she want?
She needs us back at the office.
Are you serious?
You're not going to work.
You just told me you have a drug addiction.
We need to talk about this.
I know.
And we will.
But my boss needs me.
I'll talk to you later.
She knows.
We don't know anything.
It could be about Rebecca's case.
The rug's gone, genius.
You think she didn't notice?
She obviously had us all come over here so she could get us arrested and thrown into prison for the rest of our lives.
You don't know that. Just calm down.
We'll be fine.
Yeah.
'Cause we can trust you about anything right now.
You guys are the worst liars.
Enjoy the bonfire?
Yeah, that's right.
I saw your stupid pictures.
We went last-minute.
Well, thanks for the last-minute call.
And you, Pratt.
I believe you have something of mine?
You talking about this?
Where'd you find that?
It was on the porch when I got here.
Point is, it's up for grabs now.
No. It's mine, and I haven't studied at all, so...
Then you better start.
Good. Everyone's here now?
It's Saturday. Why are we here?
Something's happened that Annalise wants to talk to you all about.
That must be the police.
I'll go get them.
The police are gonna ask you a lot of questions about my husband.
He was having an affair with Lila Stangard..
And I confronted him about it last night.
We had a terrible fight.
And now...
Now he's not answering his phone.
I-I think he might've fled.
So...
Sorry to have to involve you all in this, but you're gonna be asked a lot of questions, especially since you worked on Rebecca's case, and I need you all to be as honest with the police as possible.
Will you promise that you'll do that for me?
Of course.
Whatever you need.
Hey, asshat!
Sometime this year, will ya?
I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
Thank you. sync and corrections by <font color="##FF0000">dreaMaker7</font> www.addic7ed.com

Terrence: You believe he murdered the girl.
Annalise: Yes.
Why is that?
Because he's gone.
Missing, as you told our colleagues earlier.
Yes.
I just told him that it was over,
That I was gonna ask the d.A.
To run a dna test
On the men in lila's life.
But you didn't mention his name to the d.A. Specifically.
My associate had only just told me
That he was having an affair,
And I wanted to believe that it wasn't true,
That the test was gonna show that he wasn't the father.
So, you only found out about the affair last night?
That's correct.
How long did it go on?
Sam: Just the summer.
I mean, I worried that something was going on, of course.
I mean, he was her teacher.
She was beautiful.
But I didn't know anything for sure.
And then when I told him what I'd done...
[ breathing heavily ]
...That I was gonna tell the truth about him
One way or the other...
He got upset.
That's how foul you are, you disgusting slut.
And that's when I knew he was sleeping with her,
That he'd...
He'd probably hurt her, too.
So, you're saying that you didn't recognize this photo
When it became public.
I did not.
I mean, women aren't like men, detective.
We don't obsess over every detail of our lovers' bodies.
And you left the house after you confronted your husband?
I drove to a friend's house,
And I stayed there several hours until I calmed myself down,
And then I went back to the house after a few hours,
And I just...
Sam?
[ sniffles ]
I just...
Shop this show's fashion on LookLive.com
Sam!
[ sobs ]
I mean, I'd just hoped that it wasn't true --
That he hadn't hurt that girl --
And that we could make it right.
I'm so sorry.
Annalise: Don't be.
But when I went back into the house...
I swear, we -- we didn't mean for this to happen.
...He was gone.
And that's when you decided that he had fled,
As opposed to staying with a pal somewhere?
And then he was choking her, so -- so we hit him.
I...
[ sighs ]
I hit him.
I'd only just told him
That I was gonna tell the world the truth about him.
You listen to me closely and do exactly as I tell you.
Remove the body.
He cannot stay here.
Heads, we go back for the body.
Your dna is under his nails, on his skin,
So the only way to get rid of it is to burn the body.
We go back for the body and then what?
We do what with it?
Have any of you thought about that?
We burn it.
Then you need to get rid of the remains.
I'm telling you this is a bad idea.
If they know you were here, they'll -- they'll blame you.
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.
Annalise:
So please come home safe.
Come home so we can be together.
Sam -- are you with sam?
No. Why?
What's wrong?
Professor keating, I --
Listen, what you did tonight had to be done.
He killed that girl,
And for that, he deserved to die.
Trust me.
I got you into this,
And it's my job to get you out of it.
Now go and do what you've been told.
This friend you visited -- can we get a name?
Yeah, you know him -- nate lahey.
He was fired from your department
When your boss found out we were having an affair.
[ indistinct conversations ]
[ telephones ringing in distance ]
[ door opens ]
They're gonna schedule time to talk to you and the students.
Stay here.
I'm sorry.
They asked me who I was with.
It's okay.
No, and they're not telling me if they have any leads.
I mean, I wouldn't tell you, either, if it was my case.
They'll find him.
Don't worry.
I'll call you later.
Wes:
They don't know anything.
Really?
'cause last I heard,
We were all being interviewed by the police.
Because we work at her house.
We need to stay calm, stick to the story.
How do we know she's not setting us up, you know?
That she knows everything, and she's using these interviews
I mean, how do we know that the campus cop
Didn't call her last night and say, "oh --"
Connor.
[ siren chirps ]
[ sighs ]
What if one of us cracks, hmm,
Goes to the police and tries to get a lesser charge?
Then the rest of us will pin everything on that person.
It's four against one, so don't even try it.
Mommy's home.
What are you all doing out here?
The police asked us to wait outside.
We didn't want to get in their way, which reminds me,
Are we gonna be excused from the final exam
Now that we're involved in the investigation?
Not a chance, ms. Pratt.
Exam's still on.
Mr. Gibbins, my office.
They're wearing their paranoia on their sleeves.
Do you blame them?
Please, just let me tell them.
No.
If they knew you were helping us --
I'm not helping you.
I'm helping myself.
I'm the woman who came home
To find her cheating husband dead on the floor.
Who's the first person you think the cops are gonna look at?
The only way they're gonna get through the interviews
Is if they know as little as possible about my involvement.
That includes rebecca.
[ sighs ]
I haven't told her.
Good.
Look what happened the last time
You told her one of our secrets.
Look, look.
Everything is gonna be fine, okay?
We'll run the dna test.
It'll show that he was the father,
And then hopefully, the laptop will prove
That he was on the roof of the sorority house.
What if it doesn't?
It will.
It will.
And then we'll get the charges against rebecca dropped.
Look at me.
[ sighs ]
I've seen how strong you can be,
And that's the wes I need for you to be right now,
To help the others.
Um...
Here.
Sam's ring.
I took it off right before we...
I thought you might want it.
Thank you.
[ knock on door ]
Yes?
You should come.
I said you could wait outside.
My condolences for your husband, annalise.
He's been gone for how long now -- 15 hours?
You think this is a game?
I think you don't like your odds in rebecca's trial,
And this is how badly you need to win,
Even if it means throwing your own husband under the bus.
Why? Did he finally tell you he was leaving you?
Is this your version of a woman scorned?
I just found out that my husband
Was sleeping with a young woman who was killed,
And you have the audacity to come in here and mock me?
Get out now, or I'll throw you out.
Your husband didn't kill lila stangard.
That was miss sutter and mr. O'reilly,
And I will do everything in my power to put them in jail.
See you in court, kids.
Terrence: Can you tell us where you were last night?
I was at my apartment with my study group.
We have exams this week.
Did you do anything after that?
We stopped at the bonfire on campus.
Did you see mr. Keating during any of this?
[ both grunt ]
Grab it!
No.
The last time I saw him was two days ago.
We were working on one of our cases
When he came into the house.
Notice anything about his demeanor?
[ grunts ] oh!
I never really paid much attention to him, to be honest.
I was more focused
On preparing rebecca sutter's defense for trial,
Which reminds me, I think you should know something.
Rebecca's my girlfriend.
You're dating your client?
Professor keating's client.
I'm just a 1-l.
It's not against the law.
Rebecca,
I need to apologize to you.
For what?
Not going to the police earlier about sam's affair,
Telling them that he was the man in the photo.
If I had, then the charges against you and griffin
Would have been dropped already.
You wanted to believe he was a good guy.
I get it.
I'm gonna get the charges against you dropped.
Hopefully, before the trial.
I promise.
Okay.
Thanks.
Are you sure she doesn't know?
Of course not.
She apologized to me.
That's not something she does -- ever.
[ siren wailing in distance ]
She doesn't know.
Why aren't you freaking out right now?
I am.
No, you're not.
You're fine.
You're normal.
Which, to be honest, is freaking me out.
I'm scared, of course, like all of us,
But I know we can't give in to that.
Otherwise we get caught.
We're all gonna be okay.
Asher:
Are you kidding me?
I have everything to worry about.
I came here last night looking for the trophy.
I mean, what if they don't think that he's "missing"?
What if they think that there's foul play
Sounds like you might need a lawyer.
[ door opens ]
Professor keating.
Annalise:
We have work to do.
Rebecca goes to trial in three days
Unless we get the charges against her dismissed.
We have to prove that my husband murdered lila stangard.
First, we need motive.
Laurel: Is this even gonna be admissible?
I mean, won't the court want to obtain
Their own dna sample of sam?
Of course, but we need something to present to the court.
Then they can do their own test.
You ever gonna say
"thank you"?
For the trophy.
Doucheface totally fell for it.
Right. Thanks.
You had a girlfriend you didn't tell me about, frank.
A long-distance girlfriend.
And what about, uh, legal aid guy?
I lied to him, not you.
It's different.
Is it?
We're over, so...Stop.
Next, we have to prove that sam had the means to kill lila,
That he was in philadelphia the night she was killed.
We have proof that he left
The hotel parking garage in new haven, but we need more.
We have to prove that he drove back here that night.
So, what are you on right now?
Adderall? Heroin?
I said I would get help after exams.
I'm sure.
Oliver.
You need to help your boss prove her husband's a murderer,
So you don't have time to worry about yourself right now.
So, that guy who was here the other night,
The one with the biceps, he wasn't here last night.
When you were having your drug-induced breakdown?
Nope.
And you don't get to ask me
About who I'm dating right now, so...
Right.
So, you two are dating, then?
He got back together with his ex,
Some underwear model or --
Whatever.
You don't get to know any of this.
Finally -- here we go.
According to speedy-pass, he took I-95 up to new haven
On the 28th and returned September 4th.
What about the night of the 29th?
[ keyboard clacking ]
Nothing.
Maybe he paid cash at the tolls or took the train.
He checked his car out of the hotel garage.
Maybe he drove to the train station.
His credit-card receipts don't have him buying a ticket.
They're might be another way to track him.
Most phones record wherever you go,
So if sam backed up his phone to the laptop,
There could be data showing
He was at the sorority house that night.
Great idea.
Bonnie, I want you to go down to the police station
To retrieve sam's laptop.
Take mr. Millstone with you for backup.
So, I know there's a lot of crazy stuff
Going down right now.
I'm just saying I can't stop thinking about last night.
Try harder.
Did your boss give you the okay?
Sorry, the records say the laptop's being held
Pending review by d.A. Parks' office.
Okay, wendy parks is on record
Saying sam keating isn't a suspect here.
She's only keeping it so she can bury evidence
She knows will weaken her case.
Hey,
I'm just the weekend guy.
Laurel:
Asher just texted me.
Bonnie wasn't able to get the laptop, which is good.
That means the d.A.
Probably thinks
Michaela: Or, dumbass, it means that we don't have any evidence
Which means no one will believe that he's on the run,
Which means we become suspects.
Hello, raskolnikov.
"crime and punishment" --
The guilt eats away at him until he goes cray,
And then he turns himself in.
No one here is raskolnikov.
Look, I'm just saying that we should get drunk,
Enjoy our last days of freedom before annalise gives us up.
How would annalise know anything?
I don't know.
I mean, maybe laurel told her boyfriend.
I didn't tell frank, okay?
And wes is right.
No one knows anything.
Except the campus cop, right --
I mean the one that saw us
Carrying the body out of the house -- he knows some stuff.
Everyone needs to calm down.
Let's just focus on this case like we would any other.
Our case is a wash.
We have nothing.
You do know that
I'm sitting right here, right?
Here's the thing -- even if we can prove
That lila was pregnant with sam's baby,
It is if she told him she was gonna have it.
Which we have no proof of!
Lila asked me what clinic
I get my birth control at.
She clearly wasn't on birth control.
When she would have already known she was pregnant.
Lila would have been weird about getting an abortion.
Maybe sam wanted her to get one.
That's why she asked about the clinic.
That would prove motive, right?
What's the name of the clinic?
Annalise:
The weisenstock women's clinic.
Parks: This is a boondoggle, your honor.
She's dragged us in here on a weekend
In order to get miss sutter and mr. O'reilly's case thrown out
And implicate her husband in the murder of lila stangard.
Is this true, ms. Keating?
I recently found out
That my husband was having an affair with miss stangard.
Parks: Allegedly.
To prove that he's the father of her baby.
Regardless, the fact is,
Is that miss stangard went to an abortion clinic.
If we could obtain the records from that appointment --
Records that are permitted disclosure under hipaa --
If you were able to show me compelling evidence
Beyond mere conjecture.
I'm sorry, ms. Keating, but I'm denying your request.
Your honor -- go home, annalise.
And take care of yourself.
Careful who you show your crazy to.
[ cellphone chimes ]
Nate: Their questions were what you'd expect --
About us, our history.
Pretty standard for the most part.
For the most part?
Nate?
I'm a cop, annalise.
You don't think
I can ignore the fact
That you were with me at the same time sam went missing?
You think
I know something?
I'm an idiot if I don't ask.
I...Came to you because I needed you.
He's the monster, not me.
I'm sorry.
I just --
I needed to hear you say it.
I'm so scared.
I know.
Terrence: And that's when you went to the bonfire?
No, I went to wes' for our study group first,
In general, did you have much contact with mr. Keating?
A little.
Laurel!
[ screams ]
We worked out of his house, so...
Miss castillo...
If there's something you're not telling us...
Is professor keating gonna hear any of this?
Anything that's said in here is between us.
Um...
Sometimes mr. Keating would...
Look at me.
[ gasps ]
Look at you?
In a sexual way.
Please, don't tell professor keating about this.
I don't know what she would do.
Do you think sam really ran away?
I mean, we   artalking about annalise.
Who knows how true her story is
Or if the police even believe it?
You saying you don't believe it?
Do you?
Why are you asking?
I don't know.
I guess I'm just, you know,
Trying to wrap my head around it,
Just like everyone else.
Well, stop.
It's not your job.
Right.
No one else is thinking clearly about this.
I think that we should go to the police, confess.
We're not talking about this here.
I'm trying to find a precedent
To convince a judge to give us access to lila's clinic files.
Look, rebecca was the one that broke in.
Wes was the one that gave the final blow.
Technically, sam was still alive when you pushed him off --
I did not push him.
Look,
I'm just saying that...
We can save ourselves.
Go to the d.A. And say that -- that we were in shock,
Plead to a felony.
That means kissing the rest of our lives goodbye.
Yeah, but --
Not our careers.
Look, a felony conviction won't stop us
From sitting for the bar.
We still get to be lawyers.
Do you want to be married or go to jail?
What's going on?
Nothing.
Just without the clinic files, we're totally screwed.
To say the least.
[ knock on door, door opens ]
Bonnie: I just talked to keegan, griffin's lawyer.
He's agreed to sit on the sidelines for now.
We're doing all of his work for him.
What?
We haven't talked -- about how we left things.
Well, everything's changed.
We don't need to talk about it.
Okay.
This has got to be hard, annalise, even for you.
So I'm here if you ever need to talk.
I'm good.
[ knock on door ]
[ door opens ]
Professor keating,
I think I found something.
The weisenstock women's clinic
Has surveillance cameras in their waiting room.
The judge said hands off the medical clinic.
I know, but there's a precedent we can use --
It says, "observations of patients in clinics
Are not communications and..."
"...Therefore are not privileged,"
Which means the physician-patient privilege
So I'd like to request a subpoena
For the security footage from the clinic's waiting room.
The law prohibits the intimidation of women
There's a lesser expectation of privacy in a waiting room.
Your honor, these clinics need to be in a protected zone.
Protected from outsiders
Who object to what goes on within,
But it's not protection of those whose identities
Can be known to anyone who walks in the door.
Women whose privacy will be violated due to this request --
No one's privacy will be violated.
I'm mandating that the footage only be viewed
In a secure room inside this courthouse.
See the bailiff for instructions, ms. Keating.
Thank you, your honor.
Dna results.
Frank:
You want me to go?
Stay.
[ exhales sharply ]
He's the father.
[ sighs ]
[ exhales sharply ]
What the hell, annalise?
No one's this relieved when they find out
Their husband knocked up a dead girl,
Not unless something's going on.
Talk to me.
That way I can help you.
Okay.
Bonnie can never know.
I was just pre-gaming, you know,
Putting on the war paint,
Getting turnt up before the bonfire.
That's when I realized the trophy was gone.
A trophy professor keating gave to you.
She    awardit to me.
It's like the stanley cup of law school.
Why did you think you'd find michaela
Or the trophy at the keating house?
I figured she was turning it in to get out of the exam,
Which is a ballbuster, by the way,
And right around the corner,
So, my peeps, if we can hurry this up.
No one was at the house when you got there, right?
Asher:
And you guys call me immature?
I'm, like, the most grown-up grown-up ever
Compared to your dumb asses.
No.
Which was weird
Because connor's s.U.V.
Was parked in the driveway.
Yeah, but nobody answered when you knocked?
Nope.
Look, I was only at the house for about two minutes
Before I left and checked at the bonfire.
Then I got a call from a lady friend
Who wanted come over to my place for...
[ chuckles ]
And how long has this relationship been going on?
Mr. Millstone and I are not in a relationship.
It was a -- a one-time thing.
[ breathing heavily ] come here, you idiot.
I think what you'd like to know
Is what time I left the house, which was around 9:00,
Right after I told annalise that sam knew lila was pregnant.
Which sam told you.
I asked him, and he didn't correct me.
In fact, he made a pass at me so I'd stay quiet.
I think any man that'd do that is a man who'd skip town.
Millstone.
I need to speak with you.
I wasn't studying for the exam.
It's not about that.
What is wrong with you?
It's the po-po.
I didn't want them to think
I was hiding anything.
There's nothing to hide because it's never happening again.
Do you understand?
We had fun.
You had fun.
I was drunk and desperate.
[ door opens ]
Hey, I found something.
Laurel: There's lila.
[ keyboard clacking ]
And that's sam.
She doesn't want to go through with it.
Pause it.
Maybe she can tell us for sure.
Woman: It was obvious she didn't want to be there.
I don't think dr. Turner spent more than five minutes
Talking to her before she came back out.
And how did mr. Keating react to that?
He seemed, yeah, pretty angry.
Like, clearly, he wanted her to go through with it.
Your honor, in addition to the video,
I'd like to introduce findings from an independent lab,
Was the father of miss stangard's unborn child.
Chain of custody, your honor.
Run as many tests as you like.
That sam keating is the genetic match to this fetus.
Which still doesn't prove
Sam keating is not set to stand trial for this crime.
Which is a mistake, your honor.
You want the charges dropped against your client,
But the evidence you're presenting here today in court
Is circumstantial at best.
That's only because a key piece of evidence
Is being held hostage by ms. Parks.
I have no idea what she's talking about, your honor.
My husband's laptop is being held in police lockup.
It likely contains his cell coordinates,
Proving that he was at kappa kappa theta house
The night of the murder.
Ms. Parks refuses to examine the data
In fear that it will cost her a conviction.
Do you have access to this laptop, ms. Parks?
We do have a laptop,
Possibly belonging to sam keating, in police custody.
In light of the evidence presented today,
I'm appointing a forensic expert to analyze the phone data
Found on that computer
And present its findings to this court.
Until then, we are adjourned.
[ indistinct conversations ]
You call it crazy.
I call it winning.
I had dinner with my fiancÃ©'s mother,
Then headed over to asher's.
He was supposed to be having a party, but, well, no one came.
Where'd you go after mr. Millstone's?
Wes' for the study group.
We have exams this week.
What do you want?
Is professor keating around?
From there, we all headed over to the bonfire.
You all drove together, in mr. Walsh's s.U.V.?
That's right.
Is there a problem?
A witness told us that he saw mr. Walsh's car
Parked outside the keating house that night.
Asher: Is michaela in there with you?
I want my frickin' trophy back!
It's my fault.
Yes, because we parked there.
Well, why park at the keating house
If you were going to the bonfire?
We just knew it'd be impossible
To find parking closer to campus,
So we parked at professor keating's,
Then walked over to the bonfire from there.
Michaela: They know.
Connor: Who?
They're acting like they don't know,
Using reverse psychology to make us feel like
We're getting away with it, but --
Okay. Calm down.
[ sighs ]
Look, everything we did that night is defensible.
Rebecca went to the house alone.
When he attacked her, we were simply defending her,
And after, we were suffering from ptsd.
What about aiden?
I've reinvented myself before.
I can do it again.
I'll write crime fiction or be a housewife.
Okay, not a housewife,
But if there's one thing
I know how to be, it's smart.
[ door opens ]
We need her, too.
Hey, look who it is -- the hypocrite.
What?
You're really gonna play dumb?
You got the nerve to treat me like scum
For lying about sasha after what you did?
Frank, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Wow.
Keeping lying that good,
You might actually get away with this.
We need to talk to you.
I can't right now.
Just...
Listen to what we have to say, or we sell you out.
Judge:
Please be seated.
Mr. Ingram, were you able to access the gps data
Ingram: Yes. From the laptop, to which he backed up his phone.
Were you able to pinpoint the location
Of mr. Keating's phone on the night of August 29th?
I was.
As you can see from the monitor here,
I outlined his path of travel in red,
At the various locations he visited that evening.
We begin with mr. Keating here, in new haven, at 7:02 p.M.,
Then, if you follow the red line,
You can see how he traveled along I-95 south
And continuing all the way down to philadelphia.
Now, if I zoom in, for greater detail,
Now we're looking at his various points of travel
We can see he arrived at a coffee shop here,
But he was only there for a few minutes
And was traveling along the southern border
Of the middleton university campus,
Until finally coming to a stop at 3204 spruce road.
That's the address
Of kappa kappa theta sorority house.
[ spectators murmuring ]
And what time was mr. Keating there?
From 1:10 a.M.
Until 1:29 a.M.
The medical examiner places miss stangard's time of death
Between the hours of 12:00 a.M. And 6:00 a.M.
[ murmuring continues ]
Your honor, the record shows that my client, rebecca sutter,
Did not impregnate miss stangard,
Nor did she take her to an abortion clinic
With hopes of terminating said pregnancy,
Nor did she drive through three states
To spend 20 minutes on a rooftop
Where miss stangard's body was found in a water tank.
And yet my client stands accused of murder.
To allow this trial to proceed
Would be a gross miscarriage of justice.
Give us some room.
Reporter ##2:
What about ms. Keating?
Does she intend to defend her husband
For the murder of lila stangard?
No comment.
Is it true sam was the father
Where is ms. Keating?
Can we speak to her?
Her husband was just named the prime suspect
I think she deserves a little privacy at the moment.
So, you do know...
[ reporters shouting ]
[ breathing heavily ]
[ door opens, closes ]
Woman:
She's not like you or me.
Woman ##2:
You're defending the woman
Who just sold out her husband to win a case?
I'm just saying she's not a person
Like the rest of us are people.
What is she, then?
An animal?
Not even an animal's that heartless.
[ both laugh ]
[ door hinges creak ]
It's not what we want to do, either, but we have to.
We have to turn ourselves in and put this on them.
We can go to the police tonight.
We just proved sam's the murderer.
We're in the clear.
No, that only means that they're gonna be
More hell-bent on finding him.
The fact that he's a murderer helps us, laurel.
They'll be more lenient with us if we turn ourselves in.
Please.
Laurel, we didn't do this.
[ sighs ]
Okay.
I'm in.
[ indistinct shouting ]
Michaela: [ laughing ]
What's funny?
It's my bridal boutique.
They want to confirm a dress fitting.
[ breathing deeply ]
Look -- look, if aiden doesn't want to marry you,
It just means there's someone better around the corner.
[ vehicle door opens ]
You're quiet.
What's the matter?
Not in the mood to confess to murder?
[ chuckles ]
I'm fine.
What?
What are they doing here?
But how could she know we were coming here right now?
I had to.
Frank came to me.
He knows everything, which means annalise knows,
Because you told her, right?
No.
Stop lying.
I'm not lying.
Connor and michaela are gonna confess.
They're gonna confess and pin it on you and rebecca,
So, please, tell me the truth.
They're scared and paranoid, and I don't blame them,
But they won't listen to me.
They'll -- they'll only listen to you.
Please.
[ breathes raggedly ]
I can't do this anymore.
I don't know how, but you have to tell them.
[ exhales raggedly ]
Screw this.
Mr. Walsh.
It doesn't matter how I know.
I just know.
But I can give you a million reasons why
This plan won't go your way, or you can just trust me.
Listen, you're scared.
I know.
I understand.
And what you've been through --
There's nothing more horrible.
But, listen,
I don't blame you.
If I did,
I would have turned you in
The night that it happened.
Let me help you.
[ siren wailing ]
Let me help you.
Because if you do,
I promise you will get away with this.
Today's exam will be an analytical essay.
You will hear a fact pattern of a criminal case study
And determine the possible defenses,
Affirmative and otherwise, for each individual involved.
The case is as follows.
Four individuals walk into a convenience store.
One of them, mr. Green, decides to rob the clerk.
The clerk fights back.
The others, mr. White, miss blue, and miss red,
Come to mr. Green's defense.
A physical struggle ensues
Involving the individuals against the clerk.
The clerk becomes incapacitated.
Someone has slimmed down a bit since last time.
School stress?
Exams.
Bang!
Mr. White shoots the clerk, killing him.
[ lock disengages ]
Uh, okay, so I know it's cheesy.
I don't have a job to pay for christmas decorations,
But I thought that we should celebrate
You being done with exams and me not going to the slammer
And finally open this.
[ both chuckle ]
Now, though mr. White acted alone in killing the clerk,
All of the individuals are involved
In the disposal of the body.
Wow.
Didn't think I'd see you again.
I've been buried in work.
Yeah, welcome to law school.
I know it seems like I blew you off.
Whoa, it seems?
I'm sorry.
I just...
[ inhales deeply ]
Can we talk?
I don't want us to be over.
To get these individuals acquitted of all charges,
And there is a way.
Find it.
You have 90 minutes.
Terrence: It's got to be a little awkward,
Learning that professor keating's husband
Is a prime suspect in the case that you've been working on.
Of course.
But, honestly, it's professor keating
That I can't stop thinking about.
I just -- I can't imagine how she must feel right now.
From our limited time with her,
She strikes me as a pretty tough customer.
Or she pretends to be.
Professor keating spends most of her life
Pursuing justice for her clients,
So to find out that her husband is a criminal
Worse than all of them...
I just hope that he's man enough
To come back and face what he's done.
[ cellphone ringing ]
Connor:
I think we have a problem.
Detective, I'm hannah keating, sam keating's sister.
Let me be clear.
Whatever his wife told you, my brother is no murderer.
Your sister-in-law's in town.

I was drunk and desperate.
Rebecca goes to trial unless we get the charges against her dismissed.
We have to prove that my husband murdered lila stangard.
To allow this trial to proceed would be a gross miscarriage of justice.

Bonnie: Hi. How was your trip?
Where is she?
Upstairs.
Hi.
The Petersons still have that swing set that Sam and I used to play on when we were kids, even though their own children moved out...
What?... 30 years ago.
Mrs. Peterson is still there.
Garrett died last fall.
You've been avoiding me.
No.
Well, you haven't answered my phone calls.
Well, I went home. I had to get my head together.
To your mother's house. Bonnie said.
How is she?
She's good.
I can't remember the last time
Sam mentioned that you visited her.
Well, it's been a while.
Annalise, can we please not do this?
I don't know what you mean.
Can you at least tell me if you're concerned about him?
- Of course.
- Then why leave?
When a person goes missing...
"Fled," you mean?
Either way, you don't leave.
You stay. You put up posters.
But you stay so that you're there when they come back.
- He's not coming back.
- How do you know that?
He killed a girl. He doesn't want to go to jail.
How do you know? Did he tell you?
The detectives say that you confronted him, but he didn't confess anything.
- Would you?
- If you were my wife and a defense attorney, yeah, you bet I would.
Well, you're not a killer. He is.
What about foul play?
Why isn't that the first thing you think of...
Foul play, that... that maybe he's been hurt?
None of this makes any sense, Annalise.
Did you know I-I was with him the day after that girl was killed... Lila.
We spent the entire Labor
Day weekend together.
We... we went over... we had lobsters at Hemingways, and he helped fix the screen door on my front porch, and we talked about you, about how much he wanted that new job at Yale, and how he really thought that a fresh start would be really, really good for the both of you.
How could he have done all those little things a-after he had just strangled a girl to death?
I don't know. People don't make sense.
W-what is this?
[Sighs]
That's the evidence that
I presented to the court to prove that he killed that girl.
You read it, and then you'll understand what I've been going through.
Whatever's in that box, that's not my brother.
He is not the man we thought he was.

Connor: Hey there, killer.
Funny.
First day of a new semester.
It's all so exciting, isn't it?
Hey. Oh, God.
Thank God you're both here.
I was... I was getting really anxious.
Why? Are you worried that I finally went to the police without you and waitlist keeping an eye on me?
Connor...
Happy new year. How was everyone's break?
- What is that?
- It's a fake.
I bought it with cash at a jewelry mart in Chinatown.
So, did everyone have a nice holiday?
- Yeah.
- Um...
[Chuckles] Well, mine was great.
Aiden and I spent most of it in
East Hampton with his parents, then went to the mayor's new year's party at Gracie Mansion.
Is there any news about the sister?
Did Annalise scare her back to Boston yet, or did she just kill her?
What are you talking about?
Sam's sister.
She got here right before the break.
She went to the police, said she didn't believe any of it.
She at least told you, right?
No.
[Door opens, closes] Annalise:
Welcome back, everyone.
Vacation is over.
This is How to Get away with
Murder, the second semester, where things get even harder than the first.
[Indistinct conversations]
Wes: Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't think you needed to know.
It's his sister. How would
I not need to know that?
If I don't tell you these things, it's because they're not things that you need to concern yourself with.
You have enough on your plate.
How is she?
Good.
And you? How are you?
I'm tired.
I can imagine.
[Knock on door]
Come in!
We've got a walk-in who claims she needs a lawyer for a D.U.I. incident.
You think it's press?
Rubbernecker, more likely.
Do you want me to get rid of her?
No. We can use some fun around here.
What precinct gave you the D.U.I.?
- Excuse me?
- D.U.I.S are issued with paperwork from the precinct that pulled you over.
You don't have it?
Can we talk alone?
No, because I don't believe you.
Have you got a good enough look yet at the house where the
Middleton strangler lived?
God, I missed this place.
No, that's not why I...
I don't care about what your husband did.
I'm here for you.
I see.
So you want to see the freak that sold out her husband up close, huh?
No, I don't think you're a freak.
I...
I want to do what you did.
I'm no role model. You need to leave.
Please. I don't have anybody else.
That's not my problem.
I think you're gonna want to take my case.
I've already decided I don't.
My husband's holding two girls captive in our basement.

Rebecca: Best Christmas ever. [Sighs]
Don't have to eat dry turkey or pretend that Uncle Ray isn't ripped on scotch and looking at us inappropriately.
What's that?
Christmas card for Rudy.
[Siren wails in distance]
Hmm. Weird.
Why wouldn't his relatives know he doesn't live here anymore?
I don't know.
Maybe he's like us.
Sucky family.
- He ever say that to you?
- No.
I hardly ever talked to him.
[Sniffs]
Let's... open it.
[Groans]
- No.
- All right.
Oh, it's from his grandma!
Oh, and she's very generous.
We can get beer with dinner now.
She'll think he still lives here unless we return it.
You did better last night.
I only had to wake you once.
[Sighs] I'm sorry.
Let's have ice cream for breakfast.
I freaking love an orphan's Christmas.

Jackie: I ran away when I was 16, slept on the street.
He said he would look out for me.
So we got married, but I could never get pregnant.
Then he showed up with Rachel, and I didn't know what to do.
I just knew I didn't want him to hurt her the way he hurt me.
Then Lynn came.
She's pregnant again, about to deliver.
Last time, the baby died. So this time...
That's why I'm here.
That can't happen again.
Annalise: Call the D.A.
Tell them that we want to make a plea deal.
She's helping lock girls in a basement.
- Why would we want to protect her?
- Did you hear her?
She was 16 when she met him.
She's a victim of his abuse, too.
But she's an adult now who held those two girls captive in her own house.
And she's finally doing the right thing.
What?
Have none of you ever done anything bad that you need a lawyer for?
Sometimes your client wants to plead guilty.
And it doesn't happen often, but when it does, you have to make sure you get them the best plea deal possible.
Galvinson: What are you looking for?
Accessory after the fact, no jail time, treatment for medical and psychological conditions.
Well, that's gonna be hard without even giving us her name, Annalise.
There are two girls rotting in a basement, one of whom's about to give birth if that man doesn't beat her to death first.
Give us a deal. Then we bring her in.
If the D.A. agrees to the terms of the plea deal, then it's your job to make sure that every word out of your client's mouth is an element that you use in their defense.
I did what I could to protect them, cooked for them, cleaned their clothes.
I loved them...
In spite of him.
Of course, there's no guaranteeing that the prosecutor will keep up their end of the bargain, which is why you record everything your client says in the room.
Last time, he wouldn't let us go to a hospital, and our little girl was stillborn.
I can't let that happen again.
Lynn deserves to keep this one.
Get down! [Groaning]
I need someone to know the truth...
So the girls can finally be safe.
They deserve to be safe.
[Both sobbing]
[Indistinct conversations]
Annalise...
I was just meeting with Detective Amos.
He mentioned that you were here, working on your "House of Horrors" case.
Have you looked at the evidence yet?
Making my way through it.
Well, once you do, let me know what you think.
They have a lead on Sam.
A police officer's wife called from upstate New York and said she thinks she saw him at a rest stop.
No one told you?
No.
Right.
I guess they think you have your hands full with your case.
I'll talk to Amos, see what he knows.
Sure.
Jorge: No, no, no, no, no.
I lost the holiday golf classic under protest.
- Scott springer...
- City commissioner springer.
Yes. He kicked the ball to get a better lie.
But I didn't want to say anything because I did not want to lose that contract.
But I tell you right now, I wanted to take my 5-iron, and I wanted to bludgeon that son of a bitch!
Wait till Laurel passes the bar before you assault anyone.
Actually, dad would be charged with more than assault for that, probably aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.
- Hmm.
- Looks like someone's learning a lot.
[Laughter]
Vanessa, whatever happened with Juanita?
Do you still think you want to replace her?
I am learning a lot, especially working with this defense attorney.
She just found out her husband killed a student who he was having an affair with.
I-is that a joke?
No, he strangled her on the roof of a sorority house and then put her in a water tank.
Now he's gone missing.
This is who you've been working for?
I thought I told you.
I don't remember.
Oh, right. That's 'cause you never asked.
Well, actually, she did call once to ask me if I was dating anyone.
I am, by the way... Two guys at the same time.

You're right, so don't ask.
But I was also thinking about Connor's car.
What about it?
It's loaded with forensic evidence.
And no matter how many times he gets it cleaned...
This is how you get caught...
By being dumb enough to talk about any of this inside a courthouse.
So sit quiet at the kiddie table and know the adults are taking care of things.
Asher: Oh, franky D!
Hey, you want to hit up the squeaky Z tonight?
Been a solid week since we blew some backs out.
It depends on work.
All right, son. You let me know, yo.
Judge marber: How does the defendant plead?
No contest, Your Honor.
However, we've entered into a plea agreement with the D.A.
What are the terms?
Uh, we've agreed on three years probation and immediate outpatient treatment at a mental-health clinic.
I can't accept this until I hear from the victims themselves.
Your Honor, it would be cruel to subject these women to open-court testimony.
We'll hold an in-camera session tomorrow.
No public, no jury, no press.
Next case!
[Gavel bangs]
You said I'd get out today.
It's just a formality.
[Handcuffs click]
Draft questions for my cross-examination of the girls, anything that establishes
Jackie was Vince's victim, too, and helps the judge to accept the deal.
She's a victim. That's how the cycle of abuse works.
So stop judging and do your job.
I object to working on this case on moral grounds.
Then you can go work at another law office.
Really? You're gonna fire me when I could file a sexual-harassment suit?
Oh.
Do you want to come in?
Who are we visiting? Your boyfriend?
Well, if you won't talk to me,
I have no choice but to find answers to my questions in more unorthodox ways.
By stalking me?
Call it what you want.
It must feel good, huh, knowing you were right about me this whole time?
I've only ever loved you, Annalise.
No, you just tolerated me, because you've been too busy tearing me apart, waiting for Sam to throw out the garbage he married.
Your words reveal a lot more about what you feel about yourself right now than me.
I'm not one of your patients,
- so don't try to psychoanalyze me.
- God forbid, no.
So, sure you don't want to come in?
No. I'm good out here.
Suit yourself.
[Dog barking in distance]
Nate: You ignored my call on Christmas.
It went to voice-mail on the second ring.
And the same thing happens on New Year's.
Were you busy with family?
Mm.
Did you spend Christmas with Nia?
Yeah.
How is she?
I'm sorry.
We don't have to talk about her.
Because you don't want to?
No.
No, I just...
I want to talk about whatever you want.
We wanted to get her into this clinical trial, but her numbers... they didn't check out.
I told her about you.
She wants me to be happy.
I said I'd tell her the same thing if it was me in the hospital.
I don't think she's right.
You're very lucky you found her.
[Breathes deeply] Yeah.
[Wes screaming]
Wes. Shh, shh. Wes. I know.
Hey, you fell asleep when we were studying.
Which one was it?
The house, woods, Connor with a chainsaw?
[Exhales sharply] No.
I was locked in a basement.
That's good.
You're moving on to current events.
No more falling asleep while you're working cases about crazies.
Palate cleanser. Come on.
[Sighs]
Let's watch...
Adorable baby animals getting belly rubs.
__
Here comes Mr. Sea Monster, and he's hungry for something that tastes like little children!
Okay, enough torturing your Uncle.
Go find daddy.
Go. Go!
[Both laugh]
You didn't like my present?
He thinks you're gorgeous.
And honestly, isn't he?
Yeah. I'm just trying to be good.
[Laughs] You, good?
[Laughs]
What is it?
Tell me so I can help.
? And Christmas is in the air ?
[Inhales sharply]
? I pray when we come together ?
Um...
? Our loved ones will all be there ?
Just I-I-I have a boyfriend.
What?! Who?
Uh, his... his name is Oliver, and it's... It's really new, and I don't want to make a big deal of it, so just don't... don't tell mom.
Oh, God, no.
She'd probably start planning the wedding.
Gross.
[Laughs]
- What?
- Hmm. Nothing.
Just... my slutty little brother is finally growing up.
My grandma made it.
So this is a regift?
I couldn't pull it off, but you totally can.
Oh, yeah! Look at that!
All right, grab your coat.
We're gonna be late for our reservation at Moretti's.
- What are you talking about?
- It's like zero degrees out.
You'll be happy you're wearing your hat.
No, no. I... I mean, what are you doing, bringing me gifts and making reservations at fancy restaurants?
Well... I-I like you, and I want to spend time with you.
I can't, not tonight.
I-I already rented a movie, and it's gonna expire if I don't watch it.
Okay, yeah. I'm down for a night in.
I didn't invite you to stay.
We're not dating.
And last I heard, you were supposed to be dealing with your drug problem.
I haven't used since that night.
Well, yeah, because you were on vacation without any school or crazy professors making you work 40 hours a week.
I'm not... [sighs]
I'm not gonna freak out again.
I promise.
Look, if you kick me out right now,
I can't guarantee that I'm not gonna go straight to a dealer and buy an eight ball.
Fine.
But you stay on your end of the couch.
And you can't laugh at what I rented.
Uh, what's "The Thorn Birds"?
What did I say? [Laughs]
[Sniffs]
What the...
My car was stolen.
What? Are you kidding?
You think I would make a joke about this, Michaela?
You didn't tell the police?
No, I didn't tell the police.
Obviously, I can't.
There's traces of... you know.
Ask Frank what you should do.
Does anyone else think it's weird that those two are butt buddies?
And we're murderers. Big whoop.
Frank.
So, uh, my... my car was stolen.
Bummer. You report it to the police?
No.
Do you think I should?
Don't you want the insurance money?
Was there a time that you saw
Jackie's husband hurt her?
Yes.
And did she ever hurt you?
She was always nice, like a mother.
Did Jackie ever try to help you...
Bring you food, clothing?
She snuck us things when she could.
I like to crochet, so she'd bring me yarn.
Was Jackie ever there during the times that Mr. Groves visited you at night?
No, but she would visit us before, give us milk.
She said it would help put us to sleep so we wouldn't have to... know what he was doing.
Annalise: You drugged them?!
I was trying to help them.
By helping your husband rape those girls, making them pliable.
You've never been raped, have you?
Because I have been, by him, before him, as a child.
The memory of that is worse than what happens to you.
So, yes, I helped put them to sleep, but only so they wouldn't have the memories.
So she drugged these girls, lied to us about it, and we still haven't dropped the case.
- Remind me why.
- This isn't a democracy.
If Annalise believes a client is worth saving, then we save her.
Huh, you know, that would have sounded a hell of a lot more convincing coming out of A.K.'s mouth.
Look into the evidence they found at the house, the girls' testimony.
Just find us something that will help us go back to the judge.
Good work with Connor's car.
What do you mean? He find it?
No, and he won't, because you stole it and probably already had it destroyed.
It's also why you're hanging out with Asher.
In case he starts getting suspicious,
"keep your enemies close" type thing.
You've got quite an imagination.
Mm.
Whatever. Take my ideas.
Just don't say I don't deserve to be in the grown-up table.
Okay?
Jackie: Last time, he wouldn't let us go to a hospital,
and our little girl was stillborn.
I can't let that happen again.
Lynn deserves to keep this one.
Our little girl was stillborn.
I can't let that happen again.
Lynn deserves to keep this one.
Lynn deserves to keep this one.
Dude, this isn't a remix
I'm really down with.
What if she kept the baby?
- What do you mean?
- She says, "our little girl."
Like the baby's hers, too, and, "Lynn deserves to keep this one."
Maybe the other one was taken from her.
That baby is alive, isn't she?
That's why you wanted a plea where you serve no time...
Because you're raising the baby you told Lynn was born dead.
Admit it!
She's my little girl.
[Voice breaking] And I love her.
Where is she, Jackie?
Tell me right now.
Get me my plea deal.
Then I'll tell you where she is.
__
I'll swing by the house tomorrow and check it out.
Yeah, merry whatever to you, too.
Oh, who is that?
- Bonnie.
- Ah.
She stay in town or she go visit her family?
Nah, her family's messed up.
What do you care?
I don't.
Just we all work together, and we barely know anything about her.
So her family's messed up?
What the hell? You into her?
[Scoffs] No! God no!
[Indistinct conversations]
[Laughter]
How would you like to ride my pony?
Oh! Mmm!
Don't go there.
Why not, man? She's at least a... six.
She'll send you to the doctor unless you double wrap.
Trust me.
Well, at least we'd be Eskimo bros, then.
Am I right?
[Bottles clink] Unh.
I'll be there in 20.
Ow!
I'm staging a walkout. Here we go.
Follow me!
Except for you.
We know you don't have the balls.
Over here.
You can't interfere with my legal right to protest.
Now.
I crossed a line with you, yes, but we are both professionals here, and you need to grow up and start respecting me
- if we are gonna keep...
- You hurt my feelings... a lot.
And I know I should be used to it now, because everyone here makes fun of me all the time, but you didn't, and then you were mean to me for no reason.
Yeah, whatever. I'll...
I'll stop being a jerk.
Your husband told us the baby died two months ago.
Because that's what I told him.
She'd just turned 4, and I saw the way he started looking at her.
I couldn't let that happen.
So I told him she died and that I took care of it.
Then... why turn him in?
You kept that child safe.
Because of Lynn.
She's about to deliver, and I-I want her to know how amazing it is to be a mother.
What's the baby's name?
Heather.
Is someone with Heather?
Is she being taken care of?
She has a buddy, a giraffe, that she talks to when she is scared at night.
She knows mommy always comes back.
I thought I'd be back.
Thank God I don't have a gun, or else I'd shoot her myself.
She didn't tell you where she is?
No, not unless a deal is on the table. Where's the D.A.?
He's just around the corner.
[Sighs] Congratulations.
The D.A. gave you what you want...
No jail time and a suspended sentence.
Now give us her location.
But I'll never see her again.
This is what you wanted, Jackie!
No, I wanted to be back with her.
She's my daughter. The rest of this...
[Breathing heavily]
You claim you're not a monster.
Don't be as bad as him.
Protect the only innocent person left in all of this filth.
[Voice breaking] She's in a cabin my aunt owned...
9123 Mayersville Road.
[Sobs]
[Door opens]
Laurel: So, we need to talk.
We can't just go back to being strangers like nothing ever happened.
- This is stupid. I'm going inside.
- Michaela.
What happened to you over the break?
Everything can't be as perfect as you said.
I'm fine.
No, you're pretending to be fine.
But how could you after what we did?
That's enough group therapy for me.
Connor, unless we all start talking, we are all gonna fall apart, and that is exactly how we're gonna end up in jail.
I got back together with Kan.
I am trying to get over Frank.
I saw my family over the break.
It was the worst thing ever.
So I actually missed you guys.
You... what's going on with you?
I can't sleep without having nightmares.
I'm scared I might be going crazy.
Great. That's great. [Scoffs]
- Connor...
- No. [Scoffs]
Look, you wanted to talk.
Let's talk about how you lied to Michaela and me, how you sold us out to Annalise.
- You want to talk about that?
- Don't drag me into this.
No, we're on the same team, Michaela.
But these two... I mean, w-w-what did Annalise call them, the... the... the quiet ones, the dangerous ones?
I mean, for all we know, they're still playing us.
Playing you? See? You just proved my point.
That is exactly why we have to talk.
I don't want to tell you people anything about myself!
Okay, fine. But then you can't secretly hate us, okay?
Because that is exactly how we're gonna end up getting caught.
Fine. We talked. I'm going inside.
What's going on here?
Hi.
I'm Hannah, Sam's sister.
Who are all of you?
__
[Indistinct conversations]
? The snow is snowing, candlelight is glowing ?
? It is Christmas time at last ?
[Laughing]
? Christmas time, love is everywhere ?
- ? With someone who loves me ?
- That was the best thing...
- What's going on?
- Michaela.
- Who are you?
- Michaela, stop.
- Are you two screwing?
- Excuse me?
Michaela, this is Holden Wescott.
We worked together on the mayor's campaign.
? Twelve o'clock Christmas Eve ?
What is wrong with you?
I don't know. I just...
[Inhales sharply]
Everything at school is really hard.
- What does that have to do with me?
- It doesn't. I just... I...
You just humiliated me in front of a colleague.
Oh, God. I had too much champagne.
That only explains it if this was the first crazy thing that you've done this trip.
You slept the entire time at my parents' house.
I had to convince my mother not to call a psychiatrist, which now I think we should have done.
Okay.
I'll be better. I promise.
No, no. No, I can't do this anymore.
What?!
I think we should postpone the wedding.
[Scoffs]
No.
[Laughs] No!
No, no!
Don't... don't do this.
I swear I'll do anything you want.
Just don't... don't do this.
[Voice breaking] I love you.
I want to marry you, and you want to marry me.
[Sighs] No.
No, I don't...
Not when you're like this.
I'm sorry.
- No.
- I'm sorry.
No, no. Aiden...
[Screams]
Laurel: Michaela.
M-m-m-m-my ring.
I will let Annalise know you stopped by.
Oh, good.
And tell her none of that was as helpful as I'd hoped.
Not one girl in that sorority house saw him go upstairs to the roof that night.
And what about the fact that Sam's DNA was nowhere on that girl?
Annalise would be able to get this case thrown out with her eyes closed.
Please, Bonnie, help me.
Help me figure out what's going on here.
I know how special you were to Sam.
You should go.
Annalise: They found Heather.
She was dehydrated and malnourished,
- but she's okay.
- Oh, thank God!
- [Sobs]
- She's with Lynn.
It's good they have each other to get through this.
I know I can't see her, but maybe when she's 18, once she understands why I did this, she'll want to see me again.
You won't be out of jail by then.
But I'm not going to jail. I have a deal.
I said you had a deal, but no one was here to testify to that fact, just you and me, and you're not the only good liar in this room.
I've withdrawn as your lawyer.
Good luck finding a new one.
? I salute you, Christopher ?
Connor: If I'm being honest,
I looked forward to
"the Thorn birds" all day.
- ? I salute your life ?
- Didn't school start again?
I mean, don't you have to go home and do work?
- ? How you played the dice ?
- Yeah, but, you know, it's the first we,k, and I have to find out if
Ralph and Meggie finally do it.
? Your words will live in us ?
? Timelessly insane ?
You don't get to do that.
Uh... you kissed me.
Exactly. I'm so stupid.
Look, Oliver, relax, okay?
No. don't you get it?
You... You go through life looking like you do, meeting guys all the time, but me...
You're... you were special to me, and then you hooked up with that other guy.
Look, Oliver, I-I really like you, too.
I more than like you!
Damn it.
Like... You know the way that you can't do drugs?
That's how you are for me.
Look, we can... we can take this slow.
Just...
I don't trust anyone in my life right now except you.
So just don't... don't make me go, please.
The New York call cost us more money than I first thought.
Still, I think it got them off the scent for a few days.
They have a lead on Sam.
A police officer's wife called from upstate New York and said she thinks she saw him at a rest stop.
Thank you for taking care of that for me.
Anything else?
I know you said not to worry, but she's snooping around everywhere.
It's making the kids freak out a bit.
Well, tell them not to do that.
I will.
But she wants answers, Annalise.
You want me to handle it, just say the word.
No.
I can take care of it myself.
? I salute you, Christopher ?
? I salute your life ?
? How you played the dice ?
Can't remember the last time I saw you cook.
Me neither.
Brussels sprouts?
Seriously, is that what we're doing... brussels sprouts?
All right? I-I got the call.
I thought you invited me here and that we might talk...
Actually talk.
I'm trying here, Hannah.
No, you're not. You're hiding, Annalise.
You're hiding, when a man we both love is missing or worse.
And yet you just hide behind this wall.
Just because I'm not behaving in the way you would...
I am not asking you to cry on my shoulder, Annalise!
I am asking you to be a real person!
I am who I am.
If you don't like it, I don't care.
Oh, you do care.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be so busy avoiding me so that I couldn't see through you to see what this performance is all about.
Sam felt it, too.
But you know what? I'm done with it.
I'm done with it! I want the truth!
All right, go ahead. You want the truth?
Go ahead and ask me.
When did you start sleeping with Nate?
This summer.
He was one of the detectives on my case.
We met up at the courthouse the next day, had drinks.
And that was after Sam was sleeping with Lila.
When did you find out about Lila?
Three months ago.
You told the police it was after he'd already disappeared.
I lied.
I was already representing
Rebecca when I saw the photos, him on Lila's phone, and I did everything I could to cover his tracks.
I got rid of evidence.
I did things that would have ruined my practice, got me arrested.
I tried to help him, Hannah.
You know, all this time,
I was praying that you were hiding him somewhere, that all of this vilifying him in public, this avoiding me was just a ruse, that you were covering, that you had him someplace safe.
That's not true, is it?
He's gone.
? No submit, no compromise ?
? Saint Christopher of the truth ?
Wes: Hey, guess what I bought on the way home.
It's, uh, a CD of ocean sounds.
Apparently, if you play it, you dream of oceans and mermaids, and you don't have nightmares
[TV chatter] Where dead people chase you through the woods.
Wes, we have a real nightmare.
[Keyboard clacking] Woman:
The human remains were found
one week ago at the landfill.
And although police have yet to come forward
with a public statement,
our sources tell us the body belongs
to Middleton University professor Sam Keating,
reported missing by his wife on December the 13th.
Mr. Keating is also wanted for questioning
- in the murder investigation of Lila Stangard.
- ? I declare you as our king ?
Right now, police are still
trying to determine the cause...
? Or queen, depending on your mood ?

Previously on "How To
Get Away With Murder"...
Hi. I'm Hannah, Sam's sister.
Whatever his wife told you, my brother is no murderer.
Annalise: I'd just hoped that it wasn't true...
That he hadn't hurt that girl.
Wes: Christmas card for Rudy.
Rebecca: Yeah, he's the freak who lived here before you.
Why wouldn't his relatives know he doesn't live here anymore?
- Oh, it's from his grandma!
- [Groans]
Hm.
My engagement ring is gone!
I lost it!
- What is that?
- It's a fake.
I bought it with cash at a jewelry mart in Chinatown.
Wes, we have a real nightmare.
The human remains were found one week ago at the landfill.
The body belongs to Sam Keating.
Numerous sources within the
Philadelphia Police Department
do confirm that the tests showed it was, in fact,
his body found at the
Nayatt landfill one week ago.
Sam Keating was considered a top suspect...
She's setting us up.
What are you talking about?
You don't just find body parts in a landfill.
A body, sure.
A head, a hand, but not charred-up bits of someone.
Not unless you're told where to look.
They wouldn't have found him at all if you had listened to Wes and incinerated the body.
Wait. Why do you think Annalise would want to set us up?
Annalise wouldn't...
Wouldn't do that! Okay, we know, Waitlist.
You suckle at the teat of our dear, old Professor.
Rebecca: Annalise has no reason to sell us out.
She's the adult. You're her students.
I'm her freaking client.
Who do you think the police want to take down more? Us or her?
All of us.
This is Annalise Keating.
- If it's urgent, please call my off...
- [Cellphone beeps]
[Cellphone rings]
Finally!
Laurel: What are you doing?
Laurel?
- You can't be calling me.
- But...
You're under a microscope now.
Everything that happens from this moment on is gonna be monitored by the police.
So just sit on your hands and act normal.
Tell the rest of the rat pack the same thing.
- Who?
- Your stupid study group!
- Now, hang up and do nothing!
- [Beep]
[Sighs]
[Breathes deeply]
- Sam Keating was first reported missing...
- Connor: God!
Can you knock next time?
I just talked to Frank.
He said we're being watched,
- so it's important we don't freak out.
- Too late for this one.
- Wes: What did he say about Annalise?
- Uh, he didn't.
- Well, call him back.
- I can't.
The calls we make can become evidence used against us.
[Chuckles] Of course we can't call the one person who said they'd protect us.
Great.
[Knock on door]
Can I help you?
Are you Ms. Keating?
Depends which one you mean.
- Annalise Keating.
- That's me.
And you are?
Hannah Keating.
- I grew up in this house.
- And I live here now.
What's going on?
You haven't seen the news?
Is he dead?
I'm his sister.
Anything you can say to her you can say to me.
Is he dead?
His remains were found in a landfill several days ago.
We would have notified you sooner, but it took our department a while to get a positive I.D.
How do you know it's him?
They tested the tissue against his DNA, which was already on file for the Stangard case.
[Voice breaking] Oh, my God.
[Crying] Oh!
Oh, no.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Hannah.
Don't touch me!
[Sniffles, groans]
Oh, my God.
Arrest her.
[Gate opens]
She killed him.
Ma'am, please, if you could just calm down for a second.
She killed him, and she... She tried to hide it by making it seem like he was missing and that he had killed that girl, but he didn't.
She did it. That's her.
She's the murderer.
She killed him.
Arrest her! I said...Arrest her.
She's a murderer!
She killed my brother!
Arrest her!
Arrest her, I said!
Arrest her, damn it!
[Indistinct conversations]
[Cellphone rings]
Hello?
Nate: It's me.
I'm on a burner.
You should get one.
I'll tell Frank.
How are you?
Annalise. It's bad for me,
I know, but how are you doing?
They're gonna question me again.
Don't let them.
And make myself look guilty?
You've done their job for years.
- They'll twist whatever you say.
- I'll get a lawyer.
Well, I am a lawyer, and I'm telling you do not talk to them under any circumstances.
- Is that what you're gonna do?
- Yeah. If they want to talk to me, they're gonna have to arrest me.
Say that to them, they just might.
Don't talk to them. Promise me.
I got class.
Yeah, when we interviewed you last time, your husband was missing, Annalise.
Now he's dead.
Yes.
I notice how upset you seem by that fact.
You're gonna arrest me because my grief doesn't look the way you want it?
Go ahead.
Chapin: Negligence is a failure to, um...
I-it's a failure to, um...
This was all in your syllabus, Ms. Chapin.
I'm sorry, Professor Dozier. I just, um...
Is the heat on really high in here?
- No, that's just your nerves.
- Oh.
Dean Sumner said you weren't coming in, considering...
Sumner was mistaken.
I'll take it from here.
[Indistinct whispering]
I've opted to depart from the syllabus today.
[Chalk scratching]
Ms. Chapin.
Can you tell us what the fifth amendment is?
The fifth amendment? Um...
Right, it, um...
Assures your right to protection from self-incrimination?
Are you asking me?
No, that... That's my answer.
And it's a correct one.
When clients talk to the police, they think clarifying or being helpful can aid in their case.
They're wrong.
Whatever you say to the police can and will be misconstrued to support the prosecution.
So when I doubt, shut your mouth.
[Glass shatters]
Bonnie: [Crying]
What the hell?
No one called me last night to tell me what happened.
[Sniffles]
I just saw it on the news.
Oh, come on.
Annalise had more important things to think about than you.
She doesn't trust me anymore.
What did I say?
This isn't about you. It is.
He kissed me.
And I told her.
[Sobs]
And now he's dead.
You're not seriously upset?
The guy was a liar and a killer.
And someone killed him.
How did that happen, Frank?
Like hell if I know. Or care.
And neither should you.
He screwed over Annalise.
From the looks of it, you too.
So stop crying, or else she'll fire you again, she sees you like this.
- [Door opens]
- Annalise: Frank?
[Sniffles]
Why are the police outside?
Some bull about keeping the press away.
Well, tell them to leave.
We can handle the press.
And I have work on our case to prepare for.
Uh, about that, Annalise.
Leo Lombardo's secretary just called, and she'd like to reschedule the meeting
- in light of what's happened.
- Bastards.
Call Leo's office.
Tell them I'm on my way over and that I will not leave until I speak to him myself.
You are not firing me.
You want your nephew to be locked up for the next 20 years?
Go ahead.
Get yourself a new attorney right before trial.
Or you could stick with me and he can walk out of that courtroom like every time we've done it before.
I have never lost you a case, Leo, ever since you put me on retainer 15 years ago, and, damn it, I'm not about to lose one for you now.
Hey, hey, hey.
No one's questioning what you can do in a courtroom.
I'm worried what happens when you're not there because it's you that's locked up.
No one's locking me up!
Do you hear me?
I didn't kill my husband. I'm innocent.
Paul: [Laughs] That's good.
That's just like how you tell me to say it.
Do you agree with your Uncle?
Do you want a new attorney?
You're the one who's on trial here, Paul.
With the amount of drugs you were shipping...
Allegedly.
Do you want a new lawyer?
Do you want to take that risk?
Take it easy, Annalise.
It's not like we're the only clients in your book.
Right now you may as well be!
Listen.
Whatever is going on with me is not gonna affect your case.
I guarantee it.
Just like I guarantee you that I will kick the living crap out of the FBI in the courtroom, but only if you trust me.
It's up to you, Paul.
Do you want to fire me?
Hannah: You do know she lied to you, right?
In her interview with you,
Annalise said that she found out about Sam and Lila's affair the night Sam went missing,
but she told me she knew about the affair three months ago.
She's lying about what happened the night Sam disappeared, because she killed him and then she went to her lover's house, and together they disposed of the body.
She needed help.
She couldn't have done it by herself.
Even... even if what you're saying is true, we still need probable cause to search the house.
What about Annalise's violent past?
She comes from a violent home.
Statistics show that a child that experiences a culture of violence and abuse in the home, that that cycle continues.
Past actions are not gonna get us a search warrant.
I'll call you when we know more.
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
[Gasps]
No, you cannot be in here, Ms. Keating.
[Gasps]
[Grunts]
What if she threatened Sam's life?
If what you're saying is true, you will be called on to testify.
I'll testify to whatever you need me to.
Search that house.
- What's this?
- New client.
Is this a joke?
She's in the middle of a murder investigation.
Since when do we give up on our clients, Mr. Walsh?
Bonnie.
The client's name is Paul Lombardo.
President and owner of an import/export operation known as Lombardo distribution.
Lombardo as in Lombardo crime family?
Is this a mob case?
He's a businessman.
[As Vito Corleone] What's the charge?
Did our capo take out a rival family's capo?
Did the Don bury his goomah in some concrete?
Drug possession with the intent to distribute.
300 kilos of heroin, to be exact.
I need two of you to look at the cargo container's chain of custody...
Who had access to it, whether it was a frame job.
Go to port security and look at any available surveillance footage.
So your last name is, uh...Delfino.
Italian.
Anybody in your family, uh, you know...
Connected?
If I tell you...
You can't tell the others, got it?
[Sighs]
The drugs were found by customs agents when the container failed a random weigh-in, so the question is, why did the feds select that container over the thousands that come through the port each day?
Michaela: No. I'm never going back to those woods.
Dummy, if the cops find your ring, they'll trace it back to you.
You mean all of us.
And the police are probably waiting for the killer to return
- so they can identify them.
- Maybe that's a risk you have to take.
You know, for the good of the group.
I'm agent Anthony Fain.
You have some questions for me.
Agent Fain, yes. Just one.
According to this log, on most nights, dozens of containers are weighed, but on this night, only my client's container was randomly chosen.
The one container that happened to be full of heroin.
Are we to assume that our client was just unlucky?
Exactly.
They don't call it "random" for nothing.
Annalise: Look at the personnel at the yard and see who had the motive to take our client down.
Laurel: Who's Rudy Walters?
Guy who used to live in my apartment.
He's who put the scratches in my wall.
His grandmother still thinks he lives there, which is weird, right?
How does she not know where he lives?
It's like he just disappeared.
Or he just moved.
Rebecca said he had a nervous breakdown and vanished.
- It just sounds really weird.
- Okay, but what's also weird is our case.
The port employee who weighed the container is a guy named Pedro Hortua, but there's no Pedro Hortua listed as working at the yard, so maybe you want to help me find him.
Leave your Rudy search for after work?
Yeah.
Yeah, just give me a second.
Frank: So then
Mickey-the-ear gets wind that my pops is taking me to get a haircut.
Wait. They whacked him right in front of you?
A little kid shouldn't have to see that.
[Laughs]
You freaking playing me, man?
You've seen too many Scorsese movies.
Wait, pause that.
The container hasn't even been weighed yet, but customs agents are already arriving at the yard.
Which means the feds were tipped off to what was in the container before it was even opened.
Oh, snap.
Somebody better get the cheddar cheese, because we got ourselves a rat.
Leo: No way.
There are no rats in our family.
The surveillance tapes show that the feds arrived way too quickly.
Someone with knowledge of the heroin obviously alerted them before the container was even pulled.
Who the hell you think it is?
You think they'd still be alive if I knew?
None of that talk in front of me.
The good news is that
I can argue entrapment and get the charges dropped.
Paul: You hear that, Leo?
This snitch could help get me off.
See? You were right by keeping this husband killer around.
Maybe she can help find that rat, too, huh?
It's not in my job description.
Annalise.
You're a single lady now.
Call me if you get lonely.
What?
Chocolate and Italian wine always pair well together.
- My husband was just found murdered, Leo.
- Yeah.
You don't seem too sad about that.
Maybe I'm a good faker.
[Siren wails]
[Door opens]
Um, Mr. Fisher...
First of the month. No exceptions.
No, that's not...
About the guy who used to live in my apartment before me...
Rudy Walters?
Do you have a forwarding address?
No, thankfully, or I'd have to mail back his security deposit.
He didn't try to get it back?
No, not after the cops carted him off.
- He was arrested?
- I don't know.
Ask your girlfriend.
She's the one who called the police that night.
- You said you didn't know him.
- Because I didn't.
I stayed away from him because he was weird.
Look, that night, he was clearly losing it, okay?
He was banging on the walls and screaming things that didn't make sense, so, yeah, I-I called the cops.
You don't believe me.
- Look, if you want to leave me, you can.
- Oh, stop!
No, just... just let me... let me... let me say this.
You're freaking out.
Which I get.
I mean, you did this really terrible thing.
And now that they've found the body, now that we might get caught, you're starting to wonder...
Rebecca: If what you did for me was worth it.
None of that's true.
Then why are you obsessing about Rudy? What is this?
Because it feels like you're just trying to catch me in a lie, and that means you don't trust me.
I do trust you.
I can still tell them it was all me.
- No.
- He was on top of me.
He was going to kill me. It was self-defense.
I'm never gonna let you do that.
Well, what are we gonna do if we get caught?
Guess we'll figure it out when that happens.
[Sighs]
If it happens.
Hobbes: So you're accusing us of having a criminal informant.
Really? That's your best strategy here?
My client's container was the only one inspected that night, and the customs agents were miraculously available minutes after the inspection.
If it walks like a duck...
Might as well give up now, Annalise, because there's no C.I. here.
Fine... You're gonna force me to produce your spy in open court, prove entrapment, and destroy years of your investigation into this family.
You know, you're doing an awful lot of jaw-jacking for someone who I hear is a prime suspect in her husband's murder.
- Notice I haven't been arrested.
- Yet.
I also hear the police don't have much evidence on you.
Why don't we keep it that way, huh?
Woman: Sources tell us
Sam Keating's remains
were placed in four separate garbage bags,
much like this one,
after they were severely burned and dismembered.
Police are compiling a list of local stores
that sell this brand of bag in the Philadelphia area,
hoping to provide a lead to the Professor's killer.
You mean "the Professor's idiot killer."
You treat people like trash, the fuzz gon' find yo' ass.
Annalise: Turn it off.
The criminal informant angle is off the table.
If we could prove there's a C.I., I don't...
If I say it's off the table, it's off the table.
A friend at the court just called.
Detective Bryce is in the process of getting a warrant to search the house.
Hannah made a statement saying you threatened Sam, which gives them probable cause.
Wait, they think you killed Sam?
Call the judge and tell them that you're on your way to challenge the warrant.
Me?
It's a conflict of interest for me to defend myself in court, and I have to meet with our client.
And, Bonnie... don't screw it up.
You know, I can ask A.K. not to pair us up together anymore if you want.
So she'll know what happened between us?
No, I just...
Let's just keep it professional.
Can you do that?
Of course. Can you?
Of course.
The night at the bonfire, when you saw Connor's car in the driveway, was Annalise's car there, too?
Not that I remember. Why?
No reason.
Hannah: I was in town for a mixer the psychology department was throwing for Sam's new book.
He and Annalise got into some sort of fight.
[Chuckling] And we all left early.
Then later that night, as
I was getting ready for bed,
I heard yelling from downstairs.
Annalise yelling.
And this wasn't just a fight now.
This was... Something...Rageful.
So, I ran downstairs, and that's when I saw Annalise throw a paperweight at him.
It nearly hit him in the head.
And yelling, "I'll kill you, you worthless piece of"...
I'll spare the court the language that Annalise used.
Bonnie: After this supposed fight, which your memory claims happened three years ago, did you speak to your brother about what you saw?
Yes.
He said it had happened before, but he didn't want me to worry because he loved her and wanted to work it out.
Did he also happen to mention what caused Annalise to allegedly throw this paperweight?
Was she trying to protect herself from Sam, perhaps?
Are you suggesting that the victim caused the violence, Ms. Winterbottom?
Answer the question, Ms. Keating.
I would if you were asking the right questions.
Judge, if you would, tell...
Because what you should be asking me is was I drinking the night of the mixer.
The answer is no.
I was just recovering from a minor surgery.
Did the mixer end abruptly?
Yes.
And every guest who was there will attest to that.
Okay. Fine.
But will those same guests also confirm that it ended early because of an argument between Sam and Annalise?
Oh, honey.
I can't do all the work for you.
[Laughter]
So, we lost. Cheer up.
You know, babe Ruth didn't hit a home run his first time at bat.
What's that?
A burner.
Frank said he'd let me know the second anything happens.
Oh, like when they find microscopic bits of Sam's blood splattered in the cracks of the floor.
Everything has been cleaned.
That's what she wants us to think.
What?
You ever think the reason why Annalise didn't go challenge the warrant herself is because she wanted Bonnie to lose it?
No, you're being paranoid.
Or maybe he's just being smart.
Someone gets me.
Thank you, Michaela.
Hannah: Hello again.
You're all quite dedicated...
To stand watch at your boss's hanging.
I will say I'm surprised that you've all stuck around.
For the best and the brightest, it seems like a foolish move.
Law is not my field, but I do know that reputation is everything.
From here on, you'll each be painted with your own scarlet "A" for "Annalise."
Annalise: Get off my property.
It's my legal right to stand here on this sidewalk.
Plus, I want to be here
when they drag you out of my house in handcuffs.
That's what you always wanted.
You could never stand the idea of Sam's mistress living in mommy and daddy's precious house.
[Chuckling] "Mistress"?
Is that still how you see yourself, Annalise?
Better than the sister obsessing her entire life over her brother.
How's the saying go?
"Incest is best... put your brother to the test."
Yeah, I got to disagree with her on that one.
My sister is not attractive.
My cousin, on the other hand, oh!
[Chuckles]
[Indistinct conversations]
[Nostalghia's "Homeostasis" plays]
I'm so sorry.
I tried to traverse the search warrant, but the judge wasn't having it.
Man: Hey, there's something here.
It must have fallen off the trophy.
Here.
âª And I got my gun âª
âª I told you not to call me "hon" âª
âª To call me "hon" âª
âª she floats so soft inside his web âª
âª My spider lover, his useless head âª
âª I told you not to touch my bed âª
âª To touch my bed âª
âª I'm changing, I'm spinning âª
âª I'm morphogenic âª
âª I'm webbing, I'm morphing âª
âª I'm morphogenic âª
How much longer?
Uh, just a few luminol tests to check for blood traces, and then we'll be on our way.
âª I'm changing, I'm spinning âª
âª I'm morphogenic âª
âª I'm webbing, I'm morphing âª
âª I'm morphogenic âª
Bill.
Will you, uh, check here?
Here.
[Bottle spraying]
Woman: Aah!
[Gasps]
[Grunts]
âª I'm changing, I'm spinning âª
âª I'm morphogenic âª
âª I'm webbing, I'm morphing âª
[cellphone rings]
âª I'm morphogenic âª
They didn't find anything.
What did you think they'd find?
A bloody knife Annalise hid under her mattress?
Our boss would be a better killer than that, yo.
âª I'm tired, I'm wasting âª
âª I'm morphogenic âª
Frank: Sam's M.E. Report. Anything juicy?
His skull showed blunt force trauma.
He was hit with an object probably made out of metal.
Or steel.
So, someone finally knocked some sense into him.
Just a little too hard.
They also found carpet fibers in his remains...
Along with some debris from a wooded area.
That should give the police something to find who did this.
Connor: The debris gets them to the woods, and the woods gets them to us.
We can't talk about this here.
Look, we dodged a bullet with the search.
But that report, I-it proves they know way too much.
You're still talking.
And you both have your heads up your asses.
She's telling us to act normal
when she's the one who needs to act...
Will you two stop?
Her husband was just found murdered.
She should be grieving instead of blowing off the cops and taking on mobster drug dealers who she cares more about than saving us.
Annalise: Mr. Walsh.
My office.
I-I didn't mean any of that.
Yes, you did.
No. Don't look away.
Say everything you want to say to me right to my face.
I'm a bad person.
Heartless. A sociopath.
Is that about right?
You said you'd protect us.
- Aren't I?
- How could we know?
I mean, you...
You only talk to us in code.
You expect us to continue going to class and work your cases, even though nothing makes any sense anymore.
I want to trust you. I do, but...
Do you know why I gave you that trophy the first day?
Not because you screwed your way to it, although...
That's certainly something
I've done in my day.
But because I saw you.
Someone like me.
Someone so scared that the only way you know how to handle things is by worrying your way through them.
That's what you and I are.
Worriers.
It makes us very successful, but also very tired, too.
Here's the thing, Mr. Walsh.
You're not gonna trust me.
That's just not in your nature.
But you can stop worrying, because...
And...You might have forgotten this...
But I'm your only option here.
Without me, you go to prison.
That doesn't mean we won't end up there.
No, it doesn't.
But the odds are better with me.
Laurel got us a lead on the worker who weighed the shipping container.
Pedro Hortua quit his job two days after the FBI raid, saying he had to go take care of his sick father in Colombia, but look at this.
He just posted this from a party in cherry hill.
He's been in Jersey the whole time.
Get him.
Nate: A cop friend slipped me info on Sam's case.
They're testing the foliage and soil found with the remains to try to figure out where his body was burned.
I'll let you know as soon as
I get my hands on the results.
Do you think I did it?
Come on, Annalise.
You have to be wondering. I know I would.
So ask me.
No.
I'm not the detective on this case.
Once a detective, always a detective.
You're trying to pick a fight with me.
And I get it.
The whole world thinks you did this.
But you.
I'm asking you what you think.
What is it you say about your clients?
Never ask them if they did it.
- [Sighs]
- Hey.
- Now you're mad.
- Of course I'm mad.
He's the killer here, and whoever did this to him...
Me killing him would be the dumbest thing I could do.
That would mean he wins.
I should go.
I have court in the morning.
Lombardo case.
I heard.
Don't tell me you're judging me for defending them, too.
Not at all. I get it.
You stop working... Sam wins.
Go kick some ass.
Annalise: Agent Fain, why did you decide to inspect my client's container?
Because my team was alerted to a discrepancy with the container's weight.
So this gives you the right to search the container?
That's correct.
What was the name of the employee who first decided to weigh the container?
Can't say I recall.
His name is Pedro Hortua, and he left his job two days after the incident and disappeared without any forwarding address or information.
And once the investigation started, no one could find him.
- Thankfully, I did.
- [Spectators murmur]
Mr. Hortua.
[Murmuring continues]
How the hell did you find the guy?
We've got our secrets.
Annalise: So, how do you decide which containers are weighed, Mr. Hortua?
It's a spot check.
There's no system for it.
So you chose my client's container at random.
How is it you came to select my client's container to be weighed?
I was instructed to.
By your supervisor or someone else?
Were you warned about testifying in this case?
- Objection. Lack of foundation.
- Then answer this...
Were you promised anything for singling out my client's container for inspection?
Speculation, your honor.
Overruled. Answer the question, Mr. Hortua.
They promised me a green card.
For me and my wife.
If you did what?
If I chose Mr. Lombardo's container.
And who is it that made you that promise?
A man. I did not know him.
Mr. Hortua, one last question, and then we'll be done.
This man... is he in the courtroom right now?
Objection, your honor.
Is the man you're referring to prosecutor Hobbes?
- Your honor!
- Yes.
Good God, this is a farce!
I'm not the one on trial here!
You are now.
There's no evidence to support this man's claim.
Is the man sitting there not evidence?
- Both of you calm down.
- Because it's quite evident to me that he's proof that this case has been nothing more than a conspiracy to commit fraud.
From start to finish, the game was rigged, corners were cut, and my client's fourth amendment rights were discarded.
This is slander, your honor!
Mr. Hortua's testimony proves that this case was built on illegal grounds, including entrapment.
I demand Ms. Keating be sanctioned by this court!
It's no surprise, considering it's been Mr. Hobbes' mission to destroy the Lombardo family for more than 15 years.
So the criminal in this courtroom is not my client, but the federal government for bringing these bogus charges against my client.
[Cheers and applause]
[Gavel bangs]
Judge: Order.
Order in the court!
[Gavel bangs]
Good luck with that murder charge about to be thrown at you.
Is that an actual threat this time?
No one's threatening anyone.
I just figured you knew better, given the precarious position you're in.
Me? What about you?
You're the one dumb enough to mess with the mob.
[Door closes]
[Sighs]
Now what?
What? What does that mean?
I've been doing what you said.
I haven't bothered you at all, even though I'm... I'm totally freaking out.
Relax.
We're law students. Type-a.
We don't know how to sit on our hands and do nothing.
So just give me something to do.
I can't.
- Why not?
- 'Cause there's nothing left to do.
I didn't mean that.
You did.
[Voice breaking] We're gonna get caught.
You're not. Okay?
Come here.
[Sniffles] don't.
- Laurel.
- Don't.
Just because I'm upset doesn't mean I need you to comfort me.
I'm fine.
Am I at least allowed to stand here, comfort you that way?
Fine.
Sources tell us police are nearly finished testing
all the foliage from Sam Keating's remains.
They are confident that this new information will lead them
closer to solving the Professor's murder.
Specifically, they are hoping that this new evidence
will help them narrow down a wooded area
where Sam Keating's body was burned.
Police believe that pinpointing that burn site
will help them not only gather evidence...
But also find and arrest the Professor's murderer.
Sam's M.E. report says his skull was crushed with a heavy object.
Most likely made of metal.
I always wondered why the scales went missing the same time he disappeared.
The report also says they found carpet fibers.
Something terrible's happened.
Annalise: Bonnie! Is that you?
Yes. I'm coming.
And the debris they found,
I'm sure the tests will eventually lead them to the woods behind campus.
You're not going to get away with this, Annalise.
Not if you keep avoiding the police.
Hannah's smart.
She loves Sam too much not to solve this.
And I know why you want to protect them, but they're sneaking off all the time to talk.
You didn't do this. They did.
Don't let them ruin you.
Annalise: Trust me.
I got you into this, and it's my job to get you out of it.
Let me help you.
Because if you do, I promise you will get away with this.
But the odds are better with me.
Without me, you go to prison.
[Sniffles, sighs]
I need you right now.
[Knock on door]
We found some evidence in the woods.
It's time you talk to us, Annalise.
Okay. Let me get my coat.
Bryce: And after your fight with Sam, what did you do? Where did you go?
I went to Nate Lahey's apartment, where I spent an hour or so.
And following?
Following that, I went home.
Is there anyone who can corroborate this claim?
No one was at home when I returned, and the only thing to support my claim are the two phone calls I made...
One to my husband, who didn't answer, and the other to my associate, Bonnie Winterbottom, when I started to worry that Sam wasn't at home.
You recognize this?
[Door opens]
Connor: Oh. We're all here!
[Chuckles]
Should make it easy for the cops to round us up.
Rebecca: I just talked to my friend whose brother's a cop.
Apparently they found a ring in the woods.
That's why they brought
Annalise in for questioning.
[Breathing heavily]
Wes.
And so it begins.
Bryce: So, you recognize this ring?
Of course I do.
I gave it to my husband on our wedding day.
Any idea why we found it in the woods?
I'm on it.
Of course I don't know how it got there.
Right.
There was also a fingerprint on the ring.
Do you know who it belongs to?
We're giving you an opportunity to come clean here, Annalise.
I don't need to tell you the benefits of helping us do this the easy way.
Detective, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Why don't you tell me whose fingerprint it is?
[Pounding on door]
Nate Lahey, you're under arrest for the murder of Sam Keating.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
[Indistinct shouting]
[Camera shutters clicking]
I suppose you'll claim he didn't tell you he'd done it.
That this was all some kind of surprise for you.
Whatever the case, I do know he did it for you, and my brother is dead because of you.
You dragged him down into the gutter, Annalise...
Just like everyone else in your life.
Reporter: An arrest has been made in the death
of middleton university
Professor Sam Keating.
The suspect in question,
former Philadelphia police detective Nate Lahey,
who has been romantically linked to Annalise Keating,
the wife of the murder victim.
Detective Lahey was let go
- from the Philadelphia police...
- She did this.
- Though sources say Lahey's...
- How?
- Will in no way affect treatment...
- How did she do this?
- As a suspect going forward.
- Does it matter?
- Authorities are not releasing...
- She's doing what she said she'd do.
But we're told this arrest comes after the discovery of incriminating physical evidence...
She's taking care of us.
Physical evidence found in the wooded area...

Previously on
How to Get Away With Murder...
A woman's body was found inside the Kappa Kappa Theta House.
Arrest record on
Rebecca Sutter shows
a history of drug charges.
What's that?
A Christmas card for Rudy.
Why wouldn't his relatives know he doesn't live here anymore?
Why are you obsessing about Rudy?
You said you didn't know him.
Because I didn't.
So, you recognize this ring?
I gave it to my husband on our wedding day.
Any idea why we found it in the woods?
I'm on it.
Nate Lahey, you're under arrest for the murder of Sam Keating.
Mama? I need you.
Earlier this evening,
former Philadelphia detective Nate Lahey
was arrested at his residence in connection with the death
of Middleton University professor Sam Keating,
a man whose wife
Mr. Lahey reportedly
had an affair with.
Currently,
officers are searching
Mr. Lahey's home and vehicle
for additional evidence
that may link him to
Sam Keating's murder.
You know the drill.
What's wrong?
It was you, right?
You put Sam's ring in the woods?
You want to come in?
No.
I won't try anything.
It's not that. I just...
Thank you.
Cough.
That better not be real.
It's apple cider.
What are we celebrating?
My sobriety.
It has been a month.
Can't fake alcohol be like a trigger or something?
Wow. You even know how to kill a natural high.
Scabies infestation a few weeks back.
Close your eyes.
I only talked to him a couple times.
Yeah, no, I understand,
I just don't know what to tell you.
Yeah. I'll be there.
The police?
They saw that I called
Nate's phone that night.
Tough guy,
I'll make you my bitch.
Anna?
Anna, you there?
Can I help you?
You always leave the door open for folks to walk in off the street?
Excuse me?
Huh?
With all the murderers and criminals y'all got around here, it seems to me you could be a little more careful.
All you need is another dead body stinking up the place...
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we're not taking on any new clients at present.
Clients? Don't you know a VIP when you see one?
VIP?
Your boss came out of my "V" and her daddy's "P."
So show a little respect for her mama.
Now, my daughter, where is she?
So...
Your no-count, sorry-ass husband, who I said don't marry, couldn't keep his peter in his pants and went and slept with a white woman.
Then the fool goes and kills the white woman when he finds out that she has his bun in her nasty oven.
And after that, your ex-police boyfriend kills the no-good husband and gets himself arrested.
And you, now, ain't got no husband, ain't got no boyfriend, and you holed up in this bed like the Queen of Sheba.
Does that about cover it?
Oh, I'm all into this one.
I have to get Lottie's grandson to pull up the stories on the Google.
I know what you been up to.
Calling me up, talking about
"I need you."
Hell, yes.
Running around here like you somebody.
Get up!
Smells like somebody's dying in here.
Come on.
Get your butt up out this bed and get in the shower.
Get up!
It's all right, baby.
Come on.
Mama's here now, and everything's gonna be all right, hmm?
Nate's phone shows he talked to Rebecca the day Sam died.
The police want her to come in as soon as possible.
It's fine.
Annalise can prep her.
Frank says she hasn't left her room since Nate was arrested.
Aw. You know, we should all go give her a hug and thank her for saving our butts.
How can you celebrate the fact that an innocent man might go to jail for us?
I'll go talk to her.
No, you won't.
She's sick, and we have a new case to prep.
How? You just said
Annalise is sick.
I'm handling the case.
That must be our client.
Oh, yeah, dawgs...
Time to see the Bonbon get her legal eagle on!
Justice!
I would turn my bedroom into an ICU, make my little brothers pretend to be trauma victims.
The idea of helping people just always made me feel better about myself, which is why this is so hard.
I mean, doctors can kill a patient and keep their jobs, but for a nurse, we don't get off so easy.
And I get it, why people would think I did this.
I'm not the prettiest girl in the room, but this will ruin me.
I'll be forced onto some sexual-predator registry.
But I didn't do what that man says,
I promise you.
I didn't rape him.
Imagine you go
into the hospital for
a routine surgery and you wake up to find your nurse on top of you, sexually assaulting you.
Your genitals, exposed.
Imagine the degradation, the humiliation.
That's what Chad Manning felt when Jolene Samuels raped him at his most vulnerable.
Chad Manning is not telling you the truth, but I will.
Jolene Samuels is not a rapist.
She didn't even have sex with Mr. Manning.
This case, rather, is clearly about
Mr. Manning trying to pressure my client's employer into a financial payout.
Because Jolene... is a woman and Chad is a man.
But I'm gonna ask you to forget everything you know about rape.
Is a heinous act suffered by hundreds of thousands of victims yearly, some of whom Jolene has cared for.
This is a crime not about sex.
It's about power.
And anyone can be a victim... of slanderous allegations that are unfounded and could very well endanger her livelihood.
For that reason, you should find
Jolene Samuels guilty.
Not guilty.
That was a slip. Excuse me.
My point being,
Jolene Samuels is innocent.
We will prove that to you.
So, she's no Annalise.
So Ms. Keating is not the lead lawyer on this case anymore?
She's under the weather.
Ms. Winterbottom,
I work for the hospital.
If you lose this case, you open us up to an extremely large civil suit.
That opening statement was an abomination.
It won't happen again.
I guarantee that.
A good lawyer knows that there's no such thing as a guarantee in a courtroom.
So just do better.
Dr. Grimes, you examined Mr. Manning the day he reported the sexual abuse?
Alleged abuse.
Alleged sexual abuse.
That's correct.
And you noted bruising to Mr. Manning?
He had a large bruise on his left testicle, resulting from the sexual attack.
Your witness.
Could you please read this highlighted section from Mr. Manning's patient chart?
What medication does it say he was given before surgery?
Heparin, it's a blood thinner.
And can you confirm that blood thinners are known to cause bruising post-surgery?
Yes, but...
Bruising which could have easily spread towards his testicles.
I wouldn't say "easily."
But it could happen?
Yes.
Nothing further.
The prosecution has an eyewitness that claims he saw Jolene raping Chad.
Mmm, someone got a free peep show.
We need some way to discredit this witness.
Frank?
How are we going to get Nate out of jail?
Laurel put you up to this?
No.
I'm asking because we put an innocent man in jail and I'm assuming
Annalise wouldn't do that without a plan in place to get him off, right?
At least Laurel's charming when she asks me stupid questions.
Now shut up.
Here she comes.
Miss Rosalynn?
You were dating a man named James Smalley several months ago when he had surgery at Middleton Hospital, correct?
Mr. Smalley, is it true your ex-girlfriend took care of you during your hospital stay?
Rosalynn?
Yeah, but don't believe anything that bitch says.
Sir!
So we shouldn't believe her when she told us that you suffered a TIA during your surgery?
Objection.
Due process, it's relevant to his testimony.
Overruled.
So, did your doctors report that you had a TIA that day?
Yes.
A TIA is a small stroke.
Possible side effects include memory loss, vision impairment, and disorientation, all of which could explain why Mr. Smalley would have thought he saw something he didn't.
The witness can be excused.
What are you doing?
You can't just take Sam's suits.
Don't tell me you saving them for that sister of his.
Has she been skulking around with that
"I smelled something bad" face yet?
I'm not ready to get rid of his things just yet.
These suits are too good to go to waste.
Stop it.
Thelonius can use them for his job search.
I said stop it!
These are a man's possessions.
They're not just cheap hand-me-downs that you put in the poor box at church.
You're too proud for hand-me-downs from the poor box.
Everyone is too good for hand-me-downs in the poor box, Mama.
Oh, you want to sing that song again?
Forget it.
Our house burned down to the ground, and we were left with nothing.
And still your face was clean, your belly was fed, and your butt was covered.
I took care of you.
I protected you.
Did you?
What did you say?
Nothing.
Don't sass me, Anna Mae.
Annalise.
Anna Mae is a beautiful name.
Mama, how many times have I asked you to call me...
This is the first time.
No, this is not the first time!
First time in person.
I never been invited up in here, have I?
To Annalise Keating's fancy-ass rich house.
You get rich, you give yourself a rich name.
Annalise.
Your name is Anna Mae.
Something else your mama gave you from the poor box.
I'm not saying that the name wasn't good enough.
I'm telling you that I changed it, and I'm just asking you to respect the fact that I changed it and to honor my request...
What the hell are you talking about?
"Respect the fact" and "honor your request"?
Who the hell do you think you are?
Oprah?
I wiped your ass, and I'll call you anything I want.
You know what, Mama?
You go ahead and you take Sam's things, okay?
Just take them all.
Anna Mae.
Did you do it?
Do what?
Kill Sam.
You can tell Mama.
God is the only judge.
How much is this rich house, anyway, huh? Too much, I bet.
Mr. Fowler, as the tech expert assigned to this case, did you find any relevant evidence on the defendant's personal computer?
Yes. Last night, actually.
Objection.
I find the timing of this discovery extremely questionable.
That's for me to decide, Counselor.
Ms. Samuels' search history disclosed that she often visited an online forum called
FilthyLittleSecret.com.
I'm not familiar with that site.
Well, it's a forum where users disclose details of their sexual exploits.
Including rape?
Objection, lack of foundation until the evidence is presented to the court.
Thank you for the drum roll,
Ms. Winterbottom.
Mr. Fowler, can you confirm that this is the online identity created by Jolene Samuels for this website?
Yes.
Her computer revealed she chose the username
"FreakyNightingale."
Can you read the highlighted entry she made here?
"A girl like me doesn't get too many opportunities
"to have mind-blowing sex in her life.
"So when I got the chance
"to screw one of the sexiest men
I've ever seen,
"I jumped on it, or rather, straddled it,
"and I held on for dear life.
"It was truly the best sex I've ever had.
"And get this, he was one of my patients."
"I balanced myself on the tribal tattoo
"he sported on his shoulder.
"He winced in pain from his surgery, but I kept going."
Chad initiated the sex.
Continuing to lie to me only hurts your case.
Have you seen me?
In what world would anyone believe Chad would even look at me?
But he did.
The hospital really wants to settle.
Give Chad a good chunk of money, the charges against you will be dropped.
And then what?
I lose my job?
I get branded a rapist?
That's not necessarily...
My father is an
Episcopalian minister.
My mother plays the church organ every Sunday.
The fact that they know
I've had sex at all is the most humiliating thing
I've ever been through.
Until I was accused of this.
They'll all think I'm a rapist, and I'm not.
And I know that's hard for you to believe, especially since I've lied to you, but, please, don't give up on me.
We need to prove that the sex between Jolene and Chad was consensual.
But it wasn't.
We don't know that.
Jolene lied.
She humiliated you in open court.
So we're going to need to prove that
Chad is a worse liar.
It makes no sense not to settle this out of court.
Do you talk back to
Annalise when she asks you to do something?
Shut up, do your work, and find something that shows that
Chad's story isn't true.
You mean slut-shame the guy?
Exactly. Thank you,
Mr. Millstone.
Teacher's pet, y'all!
Only 'cause the teacher's a loser.
Aw, someone be jealous.
Would you sleep with her?
Bonnie? Uh, I don't know.
Uh, why would you ask me that?
Not Bonnie, our client.
Yeah. Right.
Uh, I don't know.
Depends on how many brewskies I've had.
Uh, can we not talk about having sex with our client?
Zero brewskies.
Okay, if I'm being completely honest,
I've ridden some pretty questionable strange in my day.
Now, do I regret it? No.
Would I go back for seconds?
Only if Asher Jr. wants a little rodeo action.
Oh, yeah.
They call me "Mr. Sex"
'cause I like to do it.
No woman wants to be on the receiving end of that.
Who... Who are you?
I'm so sorry,
Mrs. Harkness.
This is Annalise's mother.
You all clean up this mess.
It's like a pigsty.
Yes, ma'am.
I mean, where is the home training, huh?
Yes?
Sorry to bother you.
It's okay.
Come on.
What is it?
The police called Rebecca in to talk about Nate.
When is she going in?
Today.
Well, tell her to stick to her story, just answer the questions they ask, say no more or less.
I think it'd be better if she heard that from you.
No.
You know exactly how to handle her, even more so than me.
- But...
- I leave you for one minute, you got some boy-child up in here sniffing your drawers.
Mama, can you give us a moment?
You, out!
Wes, you got this.
Mama, that was one of my students.
Mmm-hmm.
Somebody's always the student, somebody's always the teacher.
That's how sex works best.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I just have to tell them
I saw Nate kill Sam.
While I'm at it, I can say he killed Rudy, too.
Rebecca...
I'm kidding.
Ms. Sutter?
I won't say anything stupid.
When did you first meet Mr. Lahey?
December.
He accosted me in a corner store like some kind of a creep, said we had a common enemy.
I know you didn't kill Lila Stangard.
Help me catch him.
Did you feel Sam Keating was your enemy, too?
Not at the time.
But it made sense to you that anyone else who looked guilty for Lila's murder only helped your case?
Of course.
I'm not stupid.
So you and Mr. Lahey formed an agreement?
I considered it...
We'll download all his phone information.
And then I told him no.
I'll call you when I get it.
You think he murdered Sam Keating?
I didn't say that.
All right. The truth.
He asked me to plant evidence in the house.
I wouldn't do it, so he said he'd find another way.
Sam's dead, so...
I guess he found one.
God, the plaintiff is really good-looking.
You should see the woman we're defending, not so good-looking.
What?
Some people might say the same thing about us.
What does that mean?
I mean, I practically work for this Annalise woman with all the hacking I do, and you've never once introduced me to her or any of your friends there.
Well, they're not my friends.
Every minute you're not with me, you're with them.
They're your friends.
Fine. I'll introduce you.
But what am I supposed to tell them?
That you're my maybe future boyfriend if you ever start trusting me again or...
You didn't tell me the rape guy's gay.
What?
Oh, my God.
Stare a little harder, why don't you?
Can you confirm that this is you in these photos,
Mr. Manning?
It is.
And they're photos you posted on HumpR, a gay hook-up app?
Objection, relevance?
I'm simply trying to figure out why Mr. Manning hasn't told the prosecutor or this court that he's gay.
Your Honor!
Counselors, approach the bench.
Rape-shield laws prohibit mention of Mr. Manning's sexual orientation...
Mr. Manning hid a fundamental fact about himself that would have bolstered his rape charge.
And if he lied about this, he could also be lying about being raped.
It's prejudicial.
The probative value outweighs any prejudicial effect.
I disagree.
Who he sleeps with is irrelevant to this case, and frankly,
I find it bordering on discrimination for you to bring it up.
Ladies and gentlemen, please disregard
Ms. Winterbottom's entire line of questioning of Mr. Manning.
You need to settle.
Tell Mr. Manning to write down a number.
We'll pay him.
You're out of your depth here.
Get Annalise out of her sick bed or wherever the hell she is so she can fix this.
No.
Excuse me?
We're not settling.
The hospital...
Isn't my client.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Fight the power, Bon.
Why are you looking up when Nate's arraignment is scheduled?
Michaela, please don't do anything stupid.
When have I ever done anything stupid?
The boss okay with you dipping into her bar?
It works for her.
Just go talk to her.
And say what?
"I have no idea how to win this case.
"Please, Mommy, give me the answer"?
Maybe not in those words.
If I go up there, she'll give me that look.
Then I'll start to cry and I'll have to quit.
Tell me that's not true.
Why'd you lie to me about Sam?
I asked you, to your face, what happened, and you said you didn't know.
We're not doing this while you're wasted.
She told you not to tell me, right?
You blame her?
No.
But it's why I can't go up there.
No, really.
I'm impressed.
A prosecutor has to keep a lot of plates spinning.
If I'm being honest here, Tammy,
I'm much better at cleaning them than
I am at spinning them.
Well, maybe if I'm lucky,
I'll be assigned to one of the cases you're arguing.
So, what's next on your docket?
The Nate Lahey case.
The detective?
I've been obsessed.
Yeah, you and the rest of Philly.
So where are you from originally?
You know, I heard that he did it for revenge.
You know I can't talk about it.
With civilians, yes, but we're both officers of the court.
I also heard he contacted that Rebecca Sutter girl to help him.
Or so she says.
What? You don't believe her?
A girl like that?
Who the hell knows?
All we know is she told the detectives that...
Nate tried to get her to plant evidence on Sam, and when she wouldn't, he threatened to hurt her.
The assistant
DA on Nate's case told you this?
Yes.
Michaela, you can't just...
I told him I was a stenographer.
He knows nothing.
See? You're not the only one who knows how to use sex to get information.
Well, at least a Rebecca lie finally helps us.
She didn't lie.
Did she tell you she didn't?
No, but I told her to only answer the questions asked.
And Rebecca always does what she's told?
I'll call her right now.
And say what?
Does it matter?
I'll clear it up.
See, this is why
I don't do chicks.
It feels like you're just trying to catch me in a lie.
I just have to tell them
I saw Nate kill Sam.
While I'm at it,
I can say he killed Rudy, too.
You said the name was Walters?
Rudy Walters.
He lived in my apartment before me.
The police came to get him, but no one ever contacted his grandmother or told her what happened.
Here.
According to this,
Rudy Walters was picked up on a 5503.
Disorderly conduct due to drug overdose.
He was taken to
Middleton Hospital and then shipped to a psychiatric hospital after that, the Enfield Behavioral Hospital.
Mmm.
Lookee there, lookee there.
The dead has arisen.
You didn't used to drink.
Annalise drinks.
Where are all those folks that work for you?
Why aren't they here?
They're at trial.
Without you?
Mama, does it look like
I can be at trial?
Does it look like
I can help anybody?
Huh, I'm just making talk.
It's a case about a man who says he was raped by a woman.
Oh, now, that's crazy.
Why, you don't think women are capable of that kind of violence?
Hell no! Women?
Other things, yes, but rape?
Uh-uh.
Men were put on this planet to take things, you know?
They take your money, they take your land, they take a woman, and any other thing they can put their grabby hands on, that's men.
Women, we're made to give love, to nurture, to protect, to care for, that's women.
I say something funny?
Your definition of a woman.
I mean, what have
I ever nurtured?
What have I ever protected, cared for, or loved?
What have you?
You really want to sing this tune?
Mmm!
I'll do the melody if you do the harmony.
How's that?
You're showing your ass, Anna Mae.
You really think you somebody, huh?
High and mighty in this fancy, rich house that I never got to...
No, no, Mama. All right?
Let's not go around and around like this.
Let's just dive right in.
Did you know?
Uncle Clyde is dead.
Did you know what he did to me?
He's dead!
Did you hear me?
And the Lord made sure he got what he deserved.
So you knew.
Anna Mae!
My sorry-ass husband might have been a cheater and a lowlife, but he saw me, why I am this way.
That man understood nothing.
Sam knew exactly what happened to me the minute I stepped into his office, everything!
He said this thing that happened to me, what you ignore, is why I am the way I am.
Your Aunt Lynn was got out by her first-grade schoolteacher.
Reverend Daniels got me after choir practice.
The first man I worked for, some of the men I dated.
I told you, men take things.
They've been taking things from women since the beginning of time.
Ain't no reason to talk about it and get all messy everywhere.
Certainly no reason to go to a headshrinker for help and end up marrying him.
You ain't learned nothing.
No.
I learned Anna Mae belonged in a hand-me-down box.
Go home, Mama.
I don't need you.
I kept thinking, if Manning's claiming rape to get a payout, maybe he's tried this before, maybe even with other hospital personnel.
So I went there to check his pre and post-op visits to see if any notations were made about him, and when I found his visitors log, look at this.
He didn't go to the doctor's office all the times he visited.
He went to the legal floor.
That makes no sense.
Why would he visit the hospital's lawyers when he's making a case against one of their employees?
It does make sense.
Your hacker boy at home?
Tell him we need his help.
Are you sure this is going to work?
No.
But we'll both feel really awesome if it does.
All rise.
Ms. Winterbottom,
I understand your client is interested in reaching a plea deal?
Yes, my client pleads no contest to a reduced charge of assault, which will be wiped from her record upon payment of restitution.
Ms. Winthrop?
Mr. Manning has already agreed.
True, but because my client's employer will be paying the restitution costs,
I wanted the hospital's lawyer to go on record in your courtroom agreeing to that.
Is the lawyer here?
David Tucker from
Middleton Hospital,
Your Honor.
We go on record as having agreed to financial terms of a settlement in the amount of $500,000.
You're very lucky someone else has picked up this tab, Ms. Samuels.
Court adjourned.
Actually, I'd like to alert the court to the fact that, by agreeing to these terms,
Mr. Tucker has just gone on record to paying himself half of that $500,000.
I'm not following.
Neither am I, Your Honor.
I recently discovered that Mr. Tucker and Mr. Manning here are lovers.
Here are e-mails between
Mr. Manning and Mr. Tucker where they've shared intimate photos of one another, as well as affectionate language.
These are my private e-mails, Your Honor.
As the hospital's attorney,
Mr. Tucker had inside knowledge as to which cases would force the hospital to pay out big, including a salacious rape charge.
This is slander.
They chose my client knowing she was timid and would make an easy mark.
In no way does this prove that these two men set up Ms. Samuels for rape.
But they did set up a joint bank account in Mykonos.
Restitution of this size should last them quite a while over there.
Ms. Winthrop, don't you think a motion is in order here?
We would like to file a motion to dismiss the charges against Ms. Samuels.
Granted.
You're free to go.
You ever think about changing your name from Winterbottom to "Ice Cold"?
Because that was balls-out amazing.
I mean, I knew you could pull it off, but who knew you'd give them the old "rope-a-dope."
Come on. Boxing?
Rumble in the Jungle?
Ali leans back on the ropes,
Foreman tires himself out.
As soon as he's spent,
Ali comes back to life and just...
Was that 'cause you're desperate again, or...
Why did you drag us all here again?
And please don't tell me we're celebrating Nate going to jail for us.
Oliver wanted to meet you guys.
Your boyfriend knows who we are?
No, and he's not my boyfriend, but I do like him and would like to get laid by him, so everyone be on their best behavior.
Oh, and I have a drug problem.
What?
I had to tell Oliver that I was an addict so he wouldn't know that we killed Sam.
So just play along unless you want to go to jail.
Oh, hey!
Hey!
Oliver, hey!
Wow. Feels like I just got off the plane in Hawaii.
Where are all the leis?
Oliver, meet Michaela,
Laurel, and Wes.
Hey!
Guys, please don't humiliate me.
Oh, we wouldn't dare.
But seriously, Oliver, you're all he ever talks about.
"Blah, blah, Oliver, blah."
Stop it.
No, he doesn't.
And seriously, about his little drug-problem thing, don't worry.
We're all doing our part keeping him honest.
Michaela, it's time for bed.
Give me a sec.
And when it comes to Connor's deep and varied emotional issues...
It's like 300 pages of tax law.
They sprung it on us this morning, so I'm... I'm gonna be here all night.
I'll call you in the morning.
The library lie?
I use that one on
Kan sometimes, too.
Is it the nightmares?
Rebecca lied to me.
Rudy, the guy who lived in my apartment?
Mmm-hmm.
I got his arrest report today.
She said he had a nervous breakdown, but actually it was a drug overdose, which put him in a mental institution.
Maybe she didn't know that.
Maybe, but the night it all happened, it was the...
The same night
Lila was murdered.
You think Rudy had something to do with Lila's murder?
I don't know.
Sam killed Lila, Wes.
We proved it in court.
What if I was wrong?
You weren't.
But what if I was and she did it?
Then what we did, what I did...
Sam dying was his own fault.
But Nate's in jail now.
And what we're doing to him is...
What if I was wrong about her the whole time?
I'll be leaving in the morning.
Shh. Come on, baby.
Come on.
Let me at your hair.
Your kitchen is tight.
Oh, stop it, Mama.
Come on, now.
Where's your comb?
Come on.
Mmm.
I bought that house over off Peachtree when
I was pregnant with you.
I was so proud of that house.
It wasn't much, but it was mine.
Built a porch swing and tended a little garden that was just right out front.
I baked up a storm on that old stove.
You know the ones that you had to light with a long match?
And one winter,
Uncle Clyde came by and said he needed a place to stay, just till he got on his feet, he said.
Can't turn your back on your family.
And then, one day I woke up in the middle of the night.
I don't know what it was.
I just woke up.
I walked down the hall to look in on you, and Clyde, he came out of your room, and I knew what he had done.
He was a big man.
Loved his liquor and his hooch.
Smoked three packs of cigarettes a day, was always stinking up the house with cigarette smoke.
All the time, he would just fall asleep on the couch, a cigarette hanging out his mouth.
I'd go by and put it out.
Then one night, not too long after, he fell asleep on the couch drunk as a skunk, that cigarette hanging out of his mouth.
I got you and your brothers and sisters out of bed, and we went over to Aunt Mabel's to sleep.
And that night, that house that I loved so much burned to the ground, and your Uncle Clyde burned right with it.
Oh, I know how you've been torturing yourself about what went on here, baby.
And maybe you did something real bad,
I don't know and don't much care if you did.
I know if you did, you had your reason.
'Cause sometimes you got to do what you got to do.
Even if all you've got is a long match and a very flammable hooch.
I'm really proud of you.
You didn't have one drink.
And we were at a bar!
I told you.
You don't need to worry about me anymore.
No, uh, uh.
None of that, drunky.
No. We've waited long enough.
I want to be boyfriends again.
And I want you to take all this off.
Come here.
Bring me that hot ass.
Hey. Stop, stop, stop.
I want this, and you.
I really do.
When you're sober.
Mmm.
Sleep tight.
I love you.
I've been in Paris, getting my degree in art history.
We don't have our parents, and our grandmother, she didn't want to worry me.
She just thought he was just really swamped with school, and Rudy's always been very private.
We're not that close, but when I didn't hear from him over the holidays, that's when I told my husband we had to come straightaway.
The police told us he was here.
We require our guests to show identification.
Of course.
Okay, Rena.
Let's go find your brother.
Shouldn't you be in class,
Miss Pratt?
I didn't know if you'd be able to make it, so I came so I could report everything that happened.
Bull.
How are we supposed to be okay with this?
He's innocent.
And black.
Injustices happen in courtrooms every day in this country.
You never bat an eye.
But...
The only difference here is you think you had a direct hand in this one.
That's me.
Which means it's my job to fix it.
Now go before anyone sees you.
All rise!
Guess what, young man.
You have visitors.
Rudy, did you hear me?
Rudy.
It's so great to see you.
Hey.
What happened to him?
Some trauma, genetics, drugs, combo of all.
You never really know.
I'll give you some time together.
Wes.
Liar.
Pleading not guilty, pretending you didn't do this.
The grieving widow? Really?
I figured you'd come up with a more original way to play this.
You think I did this to you?
How stupid would I have to be?
Just enough to think
I'd fall for it.
You had Frank plant the ring in the woods.
Was it your ego?
Is that why you did this?
Because you got fired looking into Sam?
Or was it for me?
Because you love me?
So much so, you hated the idea of any other man having me?
Either way, thank you.
That bastard deserved the grave.
How about when the police came?
Do you remember why they came to get you?
Were you with anyone?
Someone you were doing drugs with, maybe?
Is that why you got upset?
What about this?
You know her, right?
Her name's Rebecca.
Wes, stop.
Was she with you that night?
Did you do drugs together?
Wet.
What did you say?
Wet.
Say it again.
Wet.
"Wet"?
The water tank.
A woman's body was found
inside the Kappa
Kappa Theta House.

## S01E14

- Previously on Season 1 of
- How to Get Away With Murder...
I met a new guy. Mr. Darcy.
A woman's body was found inside the Kappa
Kappa Theta house.
Two suspects, Griffin O'Reilly
and Rebecca Sutter, were arrested.
Rebecca came over.
Next thing I know, we're in the middle when Lila walked in.
And that's when I see Rebecca smiling.
I knew then she set the whole thing up.
Let's go.
Griffin's gonna pin it on you!
Your client just confessed.
Got it all on tape, too.
I didn't kill her.
They made me say those things.
There was nothing going on with me and that girl.
Sam, why is your penis on a dead girl's phone?
So, how did you end up with her phone?
She left it at my apartment the night before.
Lila was six weeks pregnant.
I bet you did.
Killing her, huh?
You enjoyed it, didn't you?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Michaela!
You have to get here right now!
Get him off her!
Do something!
Were you able to pinpoint
Mr. Keating's phone on the night of
August 29th?
I was.
3204 Spruce Road.
That's the address of Kappa Kappa Theta sorority house.
You recognize this ring?
I gave it to my husband on our wedding day.
Any idea why we found it in the woods?
I'm on it.
Former Philadelphia detective Nate Lahey
was arrested in connection
with the death of
Professor Sam Keating.
Rudy?
Yeah, he's the freak who lived here before you.
She said he had a nervous breakdown,
but actually it was a drug overdose,
which put him in a mental institution.
You know her, right?
Her name's Rebecca.
Wet.
"Wet"?
The water tank.
You're reaching.
He pointed at her photo.
And said, "Wet."
Maybe he'd just seen her getting out of the shower.
On the night Lila died?
Then, the next time he looks at a picture of Rebecca, all he can say is, "Wet"?
Finally!
I'm a jerk.
Uh, I just got bound up in work, and...
Then pick up the phone when your girlfriend calls and tell her that.
My phone died.
Nobody in the library had a charger?
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.
Lila was in the water tank, not the person who killed her.
Yeah. Maybe she drowned her.
No, the autopsy would've shown that.
I need to ask her.
No.
If I'm wrong, she'll clear it up.
Or she'll freak out, Wes.
You know her.
Is something wrong?
What do you mean?
I just feel like something's wrong, and you're not saying anything.
Nothing's wrong.
You sure?
Rebecca was the one Sam attacked and the only one of us who didn't help us get rid of the body.
That is what she's gonna tell the police if she gets scared.
She can screw us all, Wes.
I've been stressed, distracted, yeah, more than I've admitted, but it has nothing to do with you at all.
We should tell Annalise.
Tell her what?
That Rebecca maybe killed Lila, which means what we did to her husband was all a giant mistake?
Please tell me how that's a good idea.
No, we go home, we act normal, at least until we know more.
Promise me you'll do that.
You promise you're being honest with me?
I'm always honest with you.
I love you.
Just shut up, okay?
Shut up?
What do you mean, shut up?
Lila, I have no idea what you're talking about!
I don't need this right now.
- I don't need all this talk.
- What do you mean?
You just came into my house and started yelling at me!
What happened?
Shut up!
What is wrong with you right now?
Stop, okay?
Tell me what happened, and I can fix it. You...
Take it!
No!
Just take it!
Not until you tell me what happened.
Nothing happened.
I just don't want to do this anymore.
Okay, look, if you don't want to deal anymore, that's fine, but at least tell me what's going on.
I'm getting back together with Griffin.
What, are you crazy? Why?
I love him.
No, you don't.
I do.
Why the hell do you care so much?
Because he's bad for you.
You know that.
He's trying to control you.
And, yeah, Darcy's an ass, but at least he's not trying to make you feel like a slut for having a sex drive!
Everything bad that's happened to me is because of you.
What are you talking about?
Ever since I met you,
I've started acting crazy.
What, because you had sex?
How is that my fault?
I would have never even flirted with Darcy if you weren't in my head all the time.
Okay, um...
Look, okay, I know you're upset.
I get it.
But I'm your friend.
I'm the only friend you have, according to what you've been telling me over and over again.
So, maybe if you could just...
I was just trying to make you feel better.
You were just a way to escape my stupid life for a little while.
I was bored and confused, but I'm done acting like some trashed-out druggie whore.
That may be fine for you, but my parents raised me better.
Get out of my house.
And don't ever call me again!
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
I'm not going to!
You need something?
Mmm. No. No, no, no! No.
Oh, come on.
I've been a good boy for so long.
Now I just want to do something bad.
We need to get tested.
What?
You're a drug addict who cheated on me with some stranger.
And how many other guys has your penis touched since then?
See? You can't even remember.
You're a slut.
Hey.
Now, I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with that.
I just... You know, one in five gay guys is HIV-positive, and half of them don't even know it.
Okay, Dr. Oliver. I get it.
I just want to do this the right way.
We can go to the clinic together.
It'll be romantic.
You're insane.
But smart.
Think about how much better the sex will feel when we don't have to worry.
I hate you.
That thing I feel in your pants is telling me a different story.
Judge, my client has extensive ties to the community, no prior record of any kind, and an ailing wife in hospice care.
She's got stage-four ovarian cancer.
Don't play the cancer card in my courtroom, counselor.
Without weighing in on the guilt or innocence of the defendant...
Traffic.
Darn. I was hoping you got laid.
My heart goes out to Mrs. Lahey, but given the gruesome nature of the crime, coupled with the defendant's police background and the potential for flight risk,
I am denying the request for bail.
Judge, please, there's no reason...
The court's made its decision.
Put your energy into the trial, counsel.
We are gonna get through this, okay?
I'm gonna do everything I can.
He didn't stand a chance in there.
Judge Redding's punishing him for what this is doing to the police department's image.
He's an idiot for not firing that lawyer.
You can't get involved, Annalise, not if you don't want them to...
Don't tell me what
I can or can't do.
Look at that, the team's all here.
You're the one client I can count on to be on time.
Let's go.
This is your life on the line, Father.
I'm gonna beg for the possibility of parole, but it's not gonna happen unless you convince them you deserve it.
I murdered a fellow man of the cloth.
I deserve no concessions.
You asked God for his forgiveness, right?
So, now you have to ask the court's.
Convince them that you're remorseful, and if you feel yourself breaking down, that's okay.
The more emotional you are...
You mean give a performance? Lie?
You can't tell me that there aren't times you spout sermons you don't believe in.
This is no different, Father.
Who the hell is she?
Father?
Agnes. She works at the church.
What if I wanted to change my plea?
You pled guilty at the arraignment weeks ago.
I know. What if I changed my mind?
Be honest with me.
Are you two...
No, absolutely not.
I've never been unfaithful to God in that way.
Then why did her coming into this courtroom cause you to change your mind?
Tell me what's going on.
Nothing's going on. I just...
I want to fight this, that's all.
When we met, you said you'd keep me out of jail, so that's what I'm asking you to do. Please.
All rise.
Keep your seats.
This is the sentencing hearing in the case of the
Commonwealth v.
Andrew Crawford.
I understand that the State has agreed to...
The defense has a request,
Your Honor.
Which is what, counsel?
My client would like to withdraw his plea.
What's the withdrawal based on?
Father Crawford felt pressured to take the plea.
Your Honor, we pressured the defendant in no way.
The State did not pressure him.
Then who was it, Ms. Keating?
Me, Your Honor.
At my first meeting with my client,
I was in the middle of a major personal crisis, as the court probably knows.
I didn't take the time to properly explain his options to him.
That's my mistake, not Father Crawford's.
And now that I've had the time to look over the case, he's changed his mind.
Please don't punish him for my own error.
What's in this again?
PCP.
Doesn't that crap make people jump off roofs?
Yeah, if you're a dumbass.
So, does Lila know you're here?
No. Why?
I was kind of a jerk earlier.
Mmm, shocker.
Come on.
You don't feel like she's been kind of weird lately?
Eh, a little,
I guess. Why?
You think something's going on?
I don't know. Just...
She barely wanted to hang out all summer, and then, all of a sudden, she's up my ass.
She wants to hang out all the time, and she cries when I say no.
Mmm.
I got enough pressure without her being needy.
You know?
Yeah.
You know, this is my first time in an actual frat house.
Seriously?
My parents didn't give me $100,000 to throw away on college, so...
Mmm.
Hey, you want to, uh, give me a tour?
Here you go.
Thanks. Kind of, uh, snuck up on me.
Lila's gonna be pissed.
Lila's not gonna find out.
Back in my room with her, our clothes are off...
What is that?
The transcripts from Rebecca's first police interview.
Okay, but why?
And where did you find them?
These files are in the cellar.
You stole files from Annalise?
We can't talk to
Rebecca directly, fine, but we can go over all the things she's said about that night and see if her story makes sense.
Wes.
Wes, if Annalise sees that...
In her police interview,
Rebecca said that she left and went home after Lila caught her with Griffin, but in the confession tapes, she said she went to Lila's sorority house.
Yeah, and that confession was coerced.
Or was it?
What's all the whispering about?
Kan and I had a fight.
I was just venting.
You two talk about your little love lives? Cute.
What do you want?
The judge just accepted
Father Andrew's
"not guilty" plea, so Bonnie wants us to take a field trip.
Your client has
admitted that they've
committed a crime.
How is it possible to argue a
"not guilty" defense?
Why is that not considered perjury?
Ms. Liebowitz.
Two reasons.
One, it's not sworn testimony, and two, entering a
"not guilty" plea doesn't mean, "I didn't do it."
It just means that the State has to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
And that heavy burden is a defense attorney's best weapon, and you got to milk it for all it's worth.
About 10:00,
I come through to light a candle for my wife, who passed last year.
I come around this pew here, and I see Father Bernard layin' there with his head cracked open.
You never seen so much blood.
The wall was sprayed with it.
His Bible, sittin' on the floor beside him, was practically floatin' in it.
Want to rack up a couple of sins, give the good
Lord a little show?
Then I saw the thurible laying next to him on the ground.
Thurible?
The murder weapon.
Usually holds the incense, but that's what did him in.
According to what you told police,
Father Andrew was the first person you suspected?
I heard them fighting earlier that week.
Father Andrew hoped to take over as head pastor once Father Bernard retired, but Father Bernard wasn't seeing it go that way.
And what about your own ethics?
You know for a fact that your client is guilty.
They've told you as much.
And yet you have to stand in front of that jury every day and lie to their faces.
Is it fair to assume that you and Father Andrew are close?
Um, well, I'm close with all of the priests.
Yes, that's my job, to allow the priests to focus on their divine office and their teaching.
Is there anything that you know that could help in
Father Andrew's defense?
I assume that's something you're interested in.
Why would I want to do that?
Because just the sight of you in the courtroom gave him second thoughts about spending 30 years behind bars.
I know what you're implying, but Father Andrew is a pious man.
A man you love.
Well, it's not like we're in a position to act on that.
We've made our choices.
Excuse me.
You lie to yourself.
That's how you do it.
You lie.
And you tell yourself that that client who you know did it did not.
Because dwelling in that truth won't let you do your job.
A student killed himself?
Brian Kamens.
He hanged himself in his grandma's garage.
Let me guess.
He was an altar boy getting the holy treatment from some of the priests here?
Not all priests are pedophiles.
Since when?
Truth.
Brian and Father Andrew spent a lot of time in the darkroom together.
Doing photography.
Then he killed himself.
That tell you enough?
Were you molesting
Brian Kamens?
Of course not.
Father Bernard confronted you about what you did to Brian, and he was gonna report you.
I did not touch that boy.
You had to silence
Father Bernard because he knew your dirty little secret.
How dare you?
I humiliated myself in court for you, Father.
You do not get to lie to me.
Brian and I spent considerable time together.
The darkroom had become a place where he felt safe enough to tell me, his friend, what was troubling him, that he was being abused by someone.
And shortly after his death,
I came to learn that person was Father Bernard.
That's why I killed him.
And I'd do it again.
I was devastated knowing that Brian had been abused, that whoever did it had driven him to kill himself.
I wanted to find that monster.
I prayed on it.
And then, one night,
God brought him to me.
Forgive me,
Father, for I have sinned.
He never mentioned
Brian by name.
I tried to stop myself, I did, praying to God for his mercy, but each time I went near him,
I couldn't stop myself.
I finally had my answer.
Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.
For his mercy endures forever.
I thought about breaking the sacrament, reporting what he'd told me, but I knew they'd just transfer him, that he'd find another Brian.
I waited for the guilt to come,
and when it didn't,
I was confused.
Part of me wondered if I hadn't done his will.
For Brian.
I know what I did was wrong.
I just don't feel it was wrong.
So we plead manslaughter instead of murder?
We can't.
Father Andrew feels that it's a sin to testify to what
Father Bernard said in the confessional booth, and evidentiary law agrees with him.
So, without that piece of information, we can't convince a jury this was manslaughter.
What about
The Thorn Birds angle?
The miniseries?
You know,
Richard Chamberlain, he's a priest, gets down with his lady friend?
It's pretty good.
Both Agnes and Father Andrew claim that their relationship was platonic.
Well, yeah.
That's what I used to tell my parents about me and our neighbor, Cole.
It's not an angle we can work right now.
Keep thinking.
Was I right, or was I right?
It all comes back to the diddlin' priests.
So, you're happy a boy was sexually abused and then killed himself?
No, I'm happy because
I'm awesome sauce.
Now what?
The detective's notes on the murder book.
He has Rebecca at
Griffin's fraternity a little after midnight, right?
Mmm-hmm.
Get the hell out of here!
Griffin?
I got your text.
Lila.
You still think he's worth it?
You stupid slut!
How could you do this?
Get off!
Lila!
I never want to see either of you again!
Screaming, scratching me.
That's why my DNA is under her nails.
And that's when I see Rebecca smiling.
The police report says people saw Lila leave the frat house around 12:30 a.m.
Then some guy from the basketball team saw someone fitting
Rebecca's description between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m.
An eyewitness?
Why didn't we ever hear that?
He identified a different girl's photo.
So, it wasn't Rebecca.
Or he just picked the wrong photo.
In his statement, the basketball player said he saw Rebecca on Spruce Road.
That's near Lila's sorority, which means
Rebecca didn't go home after the fight like she said in her first statement.
She went to the sorority house, which matches what she said in her confession tape.
No, answer it, so she doesn't get suspicious.
Hey.
Hey. Uh, look,
I'm gonna be home late tonight.
Bruce got boned by a couple of his bartenders, and he's short,
so I just got here to pick up a shift.
At the bar? Really?
You sure you want to go back there?
Yeah. It's one night.
I could use the cash.
You should come by after work. Free beer.
I don't know, um...
I think we're gonna be stuck working on this case for a while.
Yeah. Okay.
I love you.
Love you, too.
I cannot betray my vows.
Of course you can.
You just get up on that stand, and you testify that you killed a pedophile that drove a boy to kill himself.
The DA will knock it down to voluntary manslaughter.
You might even get to walk.
The sacramental seal is inviolable.
I will not betray it.
You won't betray an institution that created the environment for the abuse to occur?
Father Bernard's sin is his alone.
Why should it influence my commitment to the Lord?
You killed someone.
What would the Lord think about that?
I did something terrible, yes, but that doesn't mean that I can continue down that road.
Even if it means staying out of prison, getting to be with the woman you love?
Agnes and I never acted on our feelings!
Life is messy, Father.
We all have to make compromises in order to be happy.
That's a terribly cynical way to live.
Well, I have my reasons.
Really?
What are they?
Come.
Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you.
I'm your lawyer.
Exactly.
My job requires the same level of confidentiality as yours.
No god should forgive me for all the bad things that I've done.
I'm wasting both of our time.
Don't worry, I still plan to win your case, even if you refuse to help.
I'm so confused.
Does the book go here?
Or maybe I should put it here.
This is exactly the book
I was looking for.
My office, Frank.
Is your connection at the central jail still good?
Maybe. What's up?
Do you have the connection or not?
Is this about Nate?
Something happen to him?
Not yet.
How many sexual partners have you had in the last year?
An estimate's fine.
Twenty?
So, less than two a month?
Okay, probably more like 30.
Forty.
How often do you use a condom?
Always.
Well, okay, you know,
I mean, definitely when
I'm on the bottom bunk, and, I'd say, 80% on top.
You know, some guys ask me not to, and I...
I heard it's harder to contract if you're...
On the top bunk?
Yeah.
That's wrong.
You can contract HIV giving and receiving.
Has your current partner or any former partners ever been diagnosed or treated for an STD?
You're right.
This is so romantic.
It will be in 20 minutes when you get your results and we go home to celebrate.
You know,
I, um, actually have to go to class.
Oliver?
Yeah.
Wish me luck.
Uh, excuse me.
Could you give me my results over the phone?
Yep.
I'll call you when I hear.
Annalise?
What?
It's Nate.
He was attacked last night in jail.
Some guys beat him up pretty bad, but he's going to be okay.
Oh...
That's what you and Frank...
How else were we gonna get him out of jail?
Annalise.
Judge Redding already denied the request for a new bail hearing.
She ordered him to be placed in solitary instead.
Where's Mr. Millstone?
Um, in class, I think.
Call and tell him that we're gonna need his help.
I don't like this.
We got orders.
He's the only one who's anonymous in all of this.
We could be compromising his future.
Since when do you care so much about doucheface's future?
I heard my mad skills were desired.
Yeah.
We need help on
Father Andrew's case.
Sweet. Anything that makes me look better to the big boss man upstairs.
Uh, or woman.
See that woman standing over there?
That's Judge Redding.
I am denying the request for bail.
Walk over, say hello.
Drop the old Millstone name to break the ice.
What's the catch?
You want to seize the moment or stand here and talk about it till it's gone?
Hurry up.
Secret agent man.
All mission, no details.
That's how I like to roll.
BRB.
Judge Redding.
Asher Millstone, son to Judge
William Millstone.
Oh, my goodness!
How's your dad?
Oh, he's good.
He's wonderful.
He's just catching up on the old game.
What are you up to?
I'm going to school,
Middleton, studying law.
So, you don't love him?
Like I told you before, not in the way that you're suggesting.
Which way, then, like a brother?
So long as you hide it, there's no way that you can help me defend him.
I don't understand.
How can I help him?
I'm not involved in any of this.
But you are.
You're a good woman, and you're trying to do the right thing.
I know that.
But you're not able to be with the man you love, and you're gonna watch him being taken away in handcuffs.
And we both know he doesn't deserve that treatment.
And neither do you.
Ms. Willis, did you see Father Andrew the night Father
Bernard was killed?
I did.
And why didn't you tell that to the police before?
Because I didn't want to stain his reputation.
But I can't stand by now, not when an innocent man is going to jail.
I can't lie anymore.
Lie about what, Ms. Willis?
Uh...
I was with Father
Andrew that night.
We were being intimate.
Objection!
We received no notice of an alibi defense.
If those two were having an affair, we would have discovered it in our investigation.
Because the Philadelphia DA never misses anything.
Sustained.
Let's take a recess while we discuss whether or not this witness should testify any further.
How dare you?
You want to win, don't you?
Yeah, I'm still here.
She's not there?
Well, um...
Can you tell me the results?
Okay, yeah, I'll be sure to pick up when she calls.
Thank you.
Waiting on some big news?
Yeah. Um...
Oliver made us get tested for STDs, and the nurse won't leave the results on my voicemail.
So, I'm freaking out.
Chill out, my gay bro.
I'm sure it's fine.
How would you know?
You wrap up your dingalingadong, right?
Yeah. Most of the time.
What, like you and Aiden always used condoms when you started dating?
Damn straight.
Hey. Uh...
Did you get your results?
Yeah. Didn't you?
No, I can't get the freaking nurse on the phone. So?
We're supposed to wait till we're together.
This isn't Christmas morning, Oliver.
Just tell me.
Right. I'm negative!
Damn it.
What?
Nothing, it's just she didn't leave a message
'cause it's bad news, right?
That's not what that means.
It could be, though.
I mean, like, she doesn't want to ruin her lunch hour or something.
That's why she
didn't take my call.
Connor.
I'm sorry. I'm just...
I hate this part.
Where are you?
Annalise is going to notice.
Doing the walk from
Griffin's fraternity to the Kappa house, and it times out.
If Rebecca left the fraternity at 12:30 and was headed to
Lila's sorority, then she would've crossed paths with the basketball player on Spruce
around the time he told the police.
So why isn't there any record of her being there on her phone?
Because she probably called Lila using her burner cell, then destroyed it later.
So, she called Lila on her burner phone because she knew she was on her way to kill her?
You think I'm going crazy?
A little.
- Lila, I'm sorry, okay?
- I'm sorry.
Griffin is not the guy that you think he is, all right?
I hardly even had to try.
That was not his first time, okay?
Please, please just call me back.
A hundred bucks she comes home without her underwear again and brags about screwing some lacrosse player with
"the prettiest penis ever."
Like, what penis is ever pretty?
When did this secret affair begin?
About a year ago.
Where did the sex that night happen exactly?
In the rectory?
At the altar?
Objection!
Badgering the witness.
This is a key alibi witness.
I'm entitled to latitude.
Answer the question,
Ms. Willis.
In his room.
I came to see him after vespers.
And then what?
We had some wine.
And I began kissing him.
Who took their clothes off first, you or him?
Me.
That's enough!
- Sit down.
- Your Honor.
Get control of your client, counselor.
We need a recess.
I want to change my plea.
Again? This is dizzying,
Your Honor.
I plead guilty and confess to the murder of Father Bernard.
Your Honor, I'd like to ask for an immediate mistrial.
Because you had your client cause one?
No, the State happily accepts
Father Crawford's plea.
Your Honor, he doesn't know what he's saying.
I do, too, Your Honor.
I plead guilty to first-degree murder.
I won't change my mind again.
I did this.
I must suffer the consequences.
No. Andrew.
Don't. Please.
I'm sorry. It's done.
You can fix this still, right?
Agnes, stop.
I love you.
That is what's...
It's done.
I love you.
And I don't love you.
I made my decision, so please just leave.
Sorry I couldn't be a better client for you.
Let's go.
Esther just called from the clinic.
Guess who's HIV negative?
Aw, yeah, dawg!
C. Walsh getting his ass beat up tonight!
Pshew!
Truth!
But, you know,
I still have to, uh, go back and get tested again in three months.
Dude, I'm totally down with our rainbow coalition, but I don't need to know all the details of your sexy times.
Connor.
Enough of this, okay?
I get it.
You want to know if she didn't do this.
We all do, but sometimes you just have to accept not knowing.
I don't believe that.
You have no other choice.
I do. I can talk to her.
No!
If you do, she's gonna freak out, and she is gonna...
- She's not gonna freak out.
- Who would freak out?
Rebecca?
What do you have to ask her?
Nothing.
If she killed Lila.
What?
Excuse me?
He doesn't know anything. He's...
She lied to me.
She said she didn't know the guy who lived in my place before me, but she did, and he saw her come home wet the night Lila was killed.
Wet?
Yeah, from the water tank.
No, we don't know that.
Rebecca said she didn't go look for Lila at the sorority house, but there's an eyewitness who says he saw her there around the time Lila was killed.
Yeah, but we proved that Sam was on that roof.
Maybe he wasn't, though.
Rebecca could have been putting those coordinates on his computer that night.
Which is just speculation.
Where is she?
No, we can't just go...
No! Where the hell is she?
Guess who just went bye-bye.
Judge Perkins just replaced
Judge Redding on Nate's case.
Nate was released on bail
20 minutes ago.
Nate.
Get the hell out of here.
Just call the damn number.
You want to hate me for what you think that I've done to you, go ahead, but believe me, if you don't accept the help, you don't stand a chance of winning your case.
Believe you?
Why am I gonna do that, after everything you've done to me?
I know how it seems.
Fired, charged with murder.
I could have died in that jail if my lawyer didn't get rid of the judge.
I got rid of the judge.
All mission, no details.
That's how I like to roll.
BRB.
Judge Redding.
Asher Millstone, son to Judge
William Millstone.
Asher Millstone has been in the employ of Annalise Keating for the past several months, a woman who blames my client for the murder of her husband.
If this isn't a clear conflict of interest,
I don't know what is!
It was one harmless conversation.
I know his father.
Which is grounds for a recusal.
Either that or
I file a complaint with the judicial conduct board.
Your lawyer's not bad, but I've seen the evidence against you.
You need someone great.
Call the number.
What is this?
We need to talk.
Spit it out, psycho.
You killed Lila, right?
And you played wait list here like some loser.
Played all of us.
Why are you letting them do this?
No, you're not gonna get to manipulate your way out of this one.
I didn't manipulate anyone!
But you lied!
You said you didn't know this Rudy guy.
I didn't.
Then how come he ended up in a mental institution?
How should I freaking know?
You do, though.
You called the police on him the same night
Lila died.
He was having a nervous breakdown.
Or a drug overdose.
That was you, right?
Drugs don't make people crazy.
Yeah, but they can make you an unreliable witness in case your neighbor comes back from campus soaking wet the same night she had a fight with a girl who ended up dead in a water tank.
I mean, this...
Wes.
No, do not look at him!
You ruined our lives!
Don't you get that?
I was supposed to be getting married, and I'm not anymore.
Aiden called off the wedding because of you.
You dragged us into the horror show that is your life, and now we're all screwed forever.
So, you're gonna tell us the truth, every horrible secret about that night that you haven't told anyone, or I swear to God,
I will personally destroy you.
Tell us the damn truth, Rebecca.
Did you or did you not kill Lila?
Answer the question.
I found the campus cop.
This car one of yours?
She asked you to go into her house and burn a rug for her?
His name's Rodger Loftus.
He was fired a couple days after Sam disappeared.
Some sorority girls filed a report that he was stalking them.
I'm guessing that was
Annalise and Frank, right?
They knew we couldn't have him around, or he might remember what he saw that night.
So, they just made him go away.
Rebecca...
He had to move to
Delaware to get a job.
He works as a security guard at the Mega Super Mart.
Guess that's why he never saw the news.
Don't make me call him.
Hey, you have a second?
Depends on what you want.
It's about work, actually.
What did Judge Redding have to do with the Father Andrew case?
We thought we might need her to weigh in on what she knows about the judge on our case.
So, it's just a coincidence she was also the judge on the Nate Lahey case?
That's just a coincidence.
So, are you gonna be nice and come over later, like you said?
Does a dog like to bury his bone?
You two are that stupid, huh?
Yo, Franky D.
When we hitting the lady market in Fishtown again?
Really? You want to talk about picking up other girls in front of your girlfriend?
What?
No, man, I...
He knows, Asher.
You told him?
No, she'd never, with all the crap she's given me for screwing students.
But don't worry.
I won't tell Annalise.
Or maybe I will.
I'm gonna think on that.
What the hell's going on?
Speak.

## S01E15

(WOMAN GASPING)
(INDISTINCT ARGUING)
The cop could identify us.
He caught her coming back from the sorority house soaking wet...
Duped us.
Her original confession tape is true.
CONNOR: I keep telling you that she killed Lila.
(INDISTINCT ARGUING)
Shut up!
(ARGUING STOPS)
Please, Wes.
Make sense of this.
Everything they're saying is true.
So you think
Rebecca killed Lila?
Sam might've been innocent.
(DOOR SLAMS)
(SIGHS)
They've all lost their minds.
That's the only thing
I know for sure right now.
And I'm gonna clear everything up, the entire mess.
But first,
I need you to tell me that it's okay to take the tape off of your mouth.
You're not gonna do anything stupid?
(SHUDDERING)
I'm so sorry about all of this, Rebecca.
Help!
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(SIGHS)
Hey.
LILA: Do you lie this much to your wife?
What are you talking about?
Your receptionist said you were out of town.
At Yale, right?
You're taking that job?
I'm just giving a lecture.
What's going on?
You were fine when I left.
I tried to fix it.
Have sex with Griffin.
So he'd think the baby's his, but he wouldn't.
He just kept talking about God.
It's all gonna be okay.
You still have time.
I'm not having the abortion.
I know that. I just...
Look, I'll be back in a few more days, okay?
And we'll talk more about it then.
I need to see you now.
I told you, I have my lecture.
Can you cancel it?
You know I can't do that.
Because you want the job.
So that way you don't have to deal with me.
That is not why.
Look... (SIGHS)
Everything is gonna be okay.
I'll call you later, and we'll figure everything out. Okay?
Lila.
I'm telling Annalise.
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
(SIGHS)
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
We're gonna try this again.
No one here is gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
But you have to behave.
Otherwise... Frank?
We stow you in the basement.
You won't like it.
I'll be good.
Un-tape her hands, too.
CONNOR: What?
LAUREL: No, she's gonna...
She'll just run out of here.
We're not monsters!
We don't tie people up and hold them captive against their will.
Who have you all become?
What do we do?
You tell me. Where's Bonnie?
Still trying to get ahold of her.
Find her.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
(SIGHS)
Was that Frank again?
It doesn't matter.
Yeah, it kind of does.
Not to mention, it's hard to focus when his grizzly man beard keeps popping up in my head.
He's not gonna tell
Annalise about us.
How do you know?
Because I have personal knowledge of things he's done that are way worse than what we're doing.
Now, can you focus, or should I go ask the cute guy next door for help?
(CHUCKLES) No.
Homeboy needs no help in the snack-attack department.
Mmm.
SAM: I was afraid you'd think I hurt her.
But I could never do that.
You know me.
So I skipped my lecture, came back to see her, but I couldn't find her.
She stopped answering her phone.
I lied, yes, but only because I was afraid you'd think I killed her.
Didn't you?
No. God, no.
Let's have the trial.
You've all convinced yourselves that we were wrong, that Sam didn't kill Lila.
That we got
Rebecca off for nothing.
And you feel unfairly persecuted, trapped.
I don't blame you.
So let's be fair to everyone and figure it out once and for all.
Let's finally give Rebecca her day in court.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
(SIGHS)
Give me some privacy.
Okay.
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)
Did you get the job?
No. They haven't decided yet.
But you told them you were open to moving, even if that meant leaving your wife?
Annie...
I know.
We'll talk about it once you get the job.
How'd the lecture go?
(POUNDING ON DOOR)
(CRYING) I need to see Annalise Keating.
Is this about Frank?
I don't know who Frank is.
(SOBS)
Is Annalise in there?
Do you need a lawyer?
You can talk to me.
No. I just need to talk to Annalise.
Tell her it's about her husband.
She's not here.
That's her car, isn't it?
Annalise!
Listen.
I don't know who you are or what you think you're doing, but I guarantee you're going to regret this.
So just take a deep breath, calm down, and go home.
Leave, or I call 911.
Fine.
But tell her I came to tell her something important.
He can't keep it a secret anymore.
Who was that?
Some girl looking for Frank.
Oh, good God.
(CRYING) He knew she was pregnant.
FRANK: Oh, it's just you.
Who else did you leave a thousand messages for?
What's going on?
Not much.
Just figuring out if Rebecca killed Lila after all.
ANNALISE: Bonnie, glad you could make it.
I'm sorry.
I was just at a dinner...
This is a recording I made of
Rebecca's psych evaluation with Sam.
You taped that?
With all the lies you've told,
I'm glad I did. Watch it.
Look for any discrepancies with what she said compared to police interviews.
One hour.
Then I want to hear each of your cases against the defendant.
If Rebecca's case went to trial, then the prosecution would have argued that Griffin and
Rebecca were so high that they killed Lila after she found them sleeping together.
What if Rebecca acted alone?
In her taped confession,
Rebecca stated...
I was standing there watching Griffin pin her down.
MICHAELA:
"His hands were around her neck."
Meaning Rebecca already knew
Lila was strangled even though that was not yet public knowledge.
Look at this.
SAM: So, how did you end up with her phone?
She left it at my apartment the night before.
But according to
Sam's phone records,
Sam talked to
Lila on her burner several times after that.
What was her motive then?
It's obvious, jealousy.
Lila was beautiful.
She was wealthy.
But nowhere in this confession tape do the detectives say
Lila was strangled.
Because Lila still had her phone, which means Rebecca was lying during her psych eval.
When she found out that Lila was
"breaking up with her,"
Rebecca snapped.
Thus explaining...
She took Lila's phone... teen offenders with multiple arrests... why Rebecca's DNA... the photos of Sam to pin the murder...
Wes...
I don't have anything.
MICHAELA: Of course you do.
Rudy. He saw Rebecca the night Lila was killed wet, and she dosed him with PCP because she knew he was a potential witness.
PCP doesn't put you in a mental institution.
ANNALISE: Rebecca's right.
And where's the actual evidence that this was a crime of passion?
Or are we supposed to just trust you, Mr. Walsh?
And the detectives could have told
Rebecca that Lila was strangled before they started taping her confession.
And Rebecca lying about having Lila's phone doesn't mean that she's a killer.
I mean, where's the facts?
An explanation of how she got
Lila's body up to the water tank?
She didn't. They were already hanging out up there.
We never did that.
ANNALISE: Exactly.
Because everything that you're presenting is speculation.
You've been working with me for nearly six months now, and this is the crap case you present me with?
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Do I need to get the tape?
(DOOR OPENS)
BONNIE: Can I help you?
Emily Sinclair.
I have an appointment with Ms.
Keating.
Regarding?
I'm the new prosecutor assigned to the Nate Lahey case.
Ms. Keating was kind enough to agree to give me a statement before trial.
Now is actually not a good time.
Hmm. Well, she did confirm with me yesterday.
I'm sorry.
I'll have her call you.
Ms. Sinclair...
Would it be okay if we met at your office?
I have some house guests who could get in our way.
How about we meet at my office in an hour?
Great.
BONNIE: You're testifying for the prosecution?
Of course. Frank?
Don't let them out of your sight.
Got it.
EMILY: According to your initial interview, you went to Mr.
Lahey's apartment after your fight with your husband?
Yes.
How did Mr. Lahey react?
He was concerned for my welfare.
Was this before or after you engaged in sexual activity?
Before.
Did you have sex more than once?
Is that question really relevant?
I need a detailed timeline of that night as we have no other witnesses to Mr. Lahey's movements.
We had sex one time.
And then you made your way home.
Yes. That's when I noticed that he was following me.
Mr. Lahey followed you home that night?
Yes.
He wanted to make sure that I got home safely.
Okay.
Uh, but you never reported this in your first interview.
I wanted to protect Nate.
Protect him?
When Nate and I arrived at the house,
Sam was in the driveway getting into his car, about to leave town.
Sam?
Sam was drunk, yelling at me.
Nate got out of his car to try to calm him down.
Sam!
Sam wouldn't.
So Nate had to hold him back until I got inside.
So, let's be clear.
You're claiming that there was a physical altercation between Mr. Lahey and your husband that night.
(VOICE BREAKING)
I'm not claiming anything.
It happened.
I'm outside the coffee shop.
Where are you?
Lila, I drove all the way down here.
Talk to me.
I'm on the roof.
I just walked in on Griffin screwing someone else.
Can you believe that?
Wasn't God, I guess.
It was me.
That's not true.
It is. You don't want me.
It'd be easier if
I just went away.
Me and the baby.
I'm coming to you there, okay?
GRIFFIN: Lila!
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
Damn it,
Lila, where the hell are you?
GRIFFIN:
I looked for Lila all night.
I called her friends.
I went to her room.
I was probably there when
she was getting
strangled on that roof.
Griffin called Lila
28 times that night.
It's on the phone records.
But you didn't call her once.
'Cause you already knew she was dead, right?
Or I'd just had sex with her boyfriend, and I knew she didn't want to talk to me.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
How's it going with you two?
Do you trust him?
Shut up.
Been together about as long as me and Wes.
I trusted him.
You were right not to trust him.
After he lied to us about that night, that Annalise knew...
You think this is gonna work?
You can just get inside my head?
I'm just saying you're all spending so much time trying to figure out if I'm a killer when we already know somebody who is.
And he got us to go along with his plan that night.
He was doing that to save you.
Yeah, and then he turned on me.
Probably just like he did to his mother.
She killed herself when he was 12.
At least that's what he says.
LAUREL: So?
Did you get
anything out of her?
You mean anything other than the fact that she insinuated that wait list killed his mother?
She said that?
It's not true, is it?
No.
See?
She's a pathological liar.
Or maybe she's been honest this whole time.
She keeps lying, yes, but isn't that what we would all do if we looked guilty of a crime we didn't commit?
Meanwhile, we know
Sam was on the roof that night.
So, what?
You team Rebecca now?
I'm team whatever really freaking happened.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
ASHER: Hey! Hey, let me in!
Since when do we ever lock this door?
Here we go again.
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
Frankie D! What it do?
Office is closed today.
Then why is
Connor's car out here?
My guess is that you don't want me here
'cause you're pissed about me and Bonnie.
Shut up and go home.
No.
First I want your word you're not gonna tell AK about us.
FRANK: What I choose to tell or not tell Annalise...
What the hell are you doing?
Is none of your business.
ASHER: Look, man.
She's not just a hookup for me. It...
It actually feels pretty real.
Whatever.
Just go home.
You guys all here?
What'd I say?
Look, I'm not gonna let you blackball me from this office.
If everyone else is working today, well, then so am I.
Okay, fine. I was wrong.
But I'm still not leaving this office until you swear to me that you're not gonna tell AK about us.
Seriously, man.
Just 'cause my facial hair's not exactly as luscious as yours doesn't mean I can't still kick your ass.
What do you need,
Mr. Millstone?
ASHER: Don't be so mad.
I just wanted to make sure
Frank wasn't gonna out us.
And you risked Annalise finding out in the process.
Are you...
Are you embarrassed of me?
Is that why you don't want her to know?
No. That is not...
(SIGHS)
Annalise and I have a complicated relationship.
Like, she's a lesbian who's in love with you complicated, or...
(CHUCKLES)
You need to go.
Not without a little sugar first.
MICHAELA: She texted someone.
LAUREL: What?
"Eggs 911. Lawyer's house."
What the hell does
"Eggs 911" even mean?
And whose number is it?
I don't know.
Why don't you call it and find out?
Whoever it is, they have my number now.
And they know Rebecca's here.
We'll deal with it later.
Just like you'll deal with me later?
What are you gonna do to me, by the way?
Are you just gonna leave me down here forever?
Or are you gonna kill me Sam-style?
Everybody upstairs.
Especially you.
Lila.
Lila?
LILA: You came.
Of course.
Get down from there.
Just tell me you didn't go to my house.
Relax.
I just knew saying that was the only way to get you to come here.
I came here because I was worried about you.
You mean you were worried
Annalise would find out about me.
Hey, hey, hey. Now, look.
I know how messed up all this is, but I am here now.
And after now?
When you go home to her?
I'm alone again, having a baby all by myself.
You don't have to do this, Lila.
You're 21 years old...
I want this baby even if you don't.
So stop trying to change my mind.
I'm not going to.
You said you loved me over and over.
But you don't, do you?
You love her.
No. I don't.
Don't say that if you don't mean it.
I mean it.
I don't love her anymore.
I love you.
(SOBS)
ANNALISE: I bet you the boyfriend did it.
You've been evaluated before.
REBECCA: Juvie.
Let's get to it.
You want to know if
I killed Lila, right?
No, no. This was
a standardized
psychological test.
Still barking up that tree.
SAM: It just helps present you as a credible witness.
One of them killed Lila.
I'm just trying to figure out who.
(PAUSES TAPE)
So...
Bonnie and Asher?
Gives you the heebie jeebies, right?
It's just surprising, especially since she threatened to fire me if I started seeing you.
But you didn't listen to her, now, did you?
You're not seriously thinking about sex right now.
I always think about sex when you're around.
Stop it.
Frank, what's the endgame here?
If Rebecca talks to the police, we all go down.
But that's not gonna happen, right?
Because you're gonna take care of it?
Her?
You think I'm gonna whack Rebecca?
Is that what you think I am?
Some freaking hit man?
Wow.
No wonder you dumped me.
Frank, can you tell Bonnie
I had to run out?
I have lunch scheduled with Aiden's mother, and she...
Do whatever you want.
What's wrong with him?
Nothing.
You're going to have lunch with Aiden's mother right now?
She'll show up here if I don't go.
What does she want?
What do you think?
She wants the ring back.
The real one, not this fake.
MARY: How's your new semester going?
I imagine well, knowing how well you always have done in school.
Now, last I remember, you were interviewing for some associate's jobs, which I think is...
I'm not giving the ring back.
Aiden gave it to me with a promise to spend the rest of our lives together.
This technically means it was not an engagement ring, and according to the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court case of Lindh v. Surman...
I'm not here for the ring.
Michaela, I'm here for you.
Whatever this break you and Aiden have been on, it's lasted long enough.
Tell your son that.
I did. Many times.
Let me be clear here.
I was unfair to you.
I apologize for that and all the hurtful things I said to you.
I have seen the error of my ways, and you're not the girl I said you were.
So, would you reach out to him?
I know he acts strong, but he's waiting to hear from you...
I am that girl.
The one that tried to slap you, from the backwater bayou, that Southern ghetto trash.
I just spent a long time trying to hide her away so I could claim the prince.
Your shining, black, perfect son of a prince.
And I did.
But that girl isn't me.
Sweetheart...
I know what you're trying to do here, win this contest between us.
But this is not some ploy.
I want you in our family.
He just needs a little prodding, that's all.
He's gay, Mrs. Walker.
Aiden's gay or bi or experimental or...
I don't know what he is.
But I think you do.
Or else you would not be here scared and nervous, begging a girl you do not like very much to marry your son.
I'm sorry.
He doesn't love me.
But here's the thing...
I love me.
So I'm done.
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
I was worried when I first found out you and Wes were involved.
Because of you.
I saw you for who you were.
I recognized you.
You're angry, you lash out, you use people.
But only because you don't know better.
Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone.
And here is a boy who so clearly loved you.
He still does.
Even if he doesn't know who you are anymore.
And he hates himself right now for doing this to you.
He came to us so innocent.
And he believed you when you said you didn't do it.
But now he's grown up.
You and I have made him grow up.
Rebecca, tell me what happened that night.
That's all you need to do to do right by him.
I did it.
I killed Lila.
Or maybe Sam did it.
That'd be easier for you, right?
So you could live with yourself for turning on your own husband.
Who knows who did it.
ANNALISE: Get up.
I said stand.
You feel bad because you dragged us into this mess.
You want to wear that on your sleeve.
But I'm done making you feel okay while you sit around here and mope.
You want to make this right?
Be a man and go and get your girlfriend to talk.
She doesn't trust me anymore.
Then make her, damn it!
Are you a man or not?
Sure he shouldn't take the trophy?
Look at me.
Look at what you did to me.
You said you loved me.
I still do.
(SCOFFS)
I told you everything about me.
Every awful thing anyone has ever done to me.
But you know what?
You're the worst one.
'Cause I didn't know
I had to be afraid of you.
You don't.
You just need to tell me what happened that night.
I have told you.
I've told you again and again.
You don't believe me.
You lied about Rudy.
Oh, my God.
Will you shut up about frickin' Rudy?
Not until you tell me what happened to him.
Please, Rebecca.
I want to trust you.
Tell them all I was wrong, that you're not a bad person.
But you have to give me a reason to.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
You were right.
I gave him PCP.
(KEYS JINGLE)
(SHIVERING)
RUDY: What happened to you?
What do you want?
Nothing. Just...
Is everything okay?
I heard you fighting earlier with Lila, and...
How the hell do you know her name?
The walls are really thin.
Still, I shouldn't have been spying.
Do you feel like hanging out?
REBECCA: But I gave him something else, too.
It's called Purple X.
You don't get high a lot, do you?
No.
But people always tell me I should.
I mean, I take something for my anxiety and stuff, but people are still always like, "Lighten up, Rudy.
"You're such a stressball."
Well, this'll definitely help with that.
I'd never taken it before,
but I knew what it could do if you took too much.
RUDY: Please! Mommy, please!
WOMAN:
911, what's your emergency?
RUDY: Help me!
My neighbor's having a nervous breakdown.
Don't let them kill me, please!
I don't want to try it, Mommy!
Please!
Why are you letting me die?
Aah! Aah!
Aaah!
Please hurry.
Why are you letting me die?
I'm an awful person.
I know, I know.
I was just so scared that he was gonna talk to the police.
Why were you wet?
Because of the water tank.
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER ECHOING)
WES: She was hiding in the water tank.
She went onto the roof to find Lila, and she did.
Dead in the water.
And she heard people coming.
And she knew they'd assume she killed Lila, so she panicked.
She was on drugs, not thinking...
Then why didn't she ever tell us that?
Because she knew no one would believe her.
You can't possibly be buying this.
Wes, she's manipulating you again.
She's messed up!
That's what happens when you grow up like she did.
People take advantage of you.
You think everyone's out to screw you, so you do stupid things like lie and deal drugs and hurt people before they can hurt you.
But that doesn't make you a murderer.
Please...
I believe her.
We're done trying this case.
Come on!
What?
She's a pathological liar!
What have I told you time and time again?
There's no truth in the courtroom.
There's just your version of what happened versus theirs.
That's how the justice system works.
It's not what's right and what's fair, it's who tells the most convincing story.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
And right now, none of you have been able to convince me that Rebecca did this.
So, what do we do now?
(RINGING CONTINUES)
(BONNIE SIGHS)
The hell if I know.
(SIGHS)
BONNIE: Annalise...
ANNALISE: I had no choice.
The prosecutor approached me.
I had to make a statement.
You mean make up a statement.
I know how it looks.
All you do is lie.
Again and again, then you expect me to trust you.
Nate, please, there's a reason.
You're trying to win my case. I know.
If I had physical contact with Sam that night, it explains why my print is on his ring.
The jury will have their reasonable doubt, and I go free.
Tell me I'm wrong.
I know you didn't kill Sam, and I know you think I set you up to go down for this. I didn't.
It's hard to believe,
I understand, but you need to try.
I'm doing everything that I can to help you.
Trust me.
All right? Will you do that?
Try to trust me.
(DOOR CLOSES)
We know what to do.
We pin Sam's murder on Rebecca.
We know that seems hard, especially since we already did the same thing with Nate, but it makes sense.
Sam killed Lila, so Rebecca killed Sam.
CONNOR: And then those of us that actually killed Sam, we testify that Rebecca was the one that did it.
You just have to convince wait list.
We thought we can get the surveillance tape from the store where Nate first approached Rebecca.
That way, we can establish that she came to the house with the thumb drive and she put...
ANNALISE: Stop.
We can't go changing stories with the police, telling a different version every time we feel like it.
Told you.
But...
It's over, Miss Pratt.
We have to let it go.
What? No!
We haven't proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
She's gonna go straight to the police.
Not if I convince her not to.
How?
I'm gonna ask her nicely.
(MICHAELA SCOFFS)
That's not gonna work.
We abducted her.
Taped her to a chair.
She'll get over it.
MICHAELA: No, she won't!
She only thinks of herself.
That's not true.
(MICHAELA SCOFFS)
You're not still into her?
LAUREL: Please, Frank, there has to be something else we can do.
Don't you dare put this on Frank.
We have gone above and beyond here to try to fix this for all of you because this, from the very start, has been your mess, each of you.
And Frank and I have been more than willing to try to save all your stupid asses.
Not to mention Annalise, who for reasons beyond me, continues to protect you.
And after what you did to her, what you took from her...
ANNALISE: Rebecca! Rebecca!
What the hell happened?
She was gone when
I got down there.
Who was it?
Tell me. Who let her go?
Who let her go, damn it?
I didn't let her go.
You have to believe me.
I do.
All of this...
Rebecca, Sam, Nate...
It's all my fault.
(SIGHS)
It's okay.
It's okay.
(SOBBING)
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
SAM: I don't love her anymore.
I love you.
I know that now.
It's just...
Just taken me a while to accept it.
But Annalise and I, we...
We've been over for years now.
And when I met you...
(SNIFFLES)
I haven't felt this way in a long time, and I don't ever want to not feel this way again.
It's you,
Lila.
I love you.
ANNALISE: Because what matters now is that
Sam killed Lila.
He did.
Sam killed her.
We don't know that.
No.
But it's what the two of us need to choose to believe.
Hey. You don't know me.
My name's Nate Lahey.
Annalise Keating gave me your number.
ANNALISE: With everything that's happened, it's the version of the truth that makes the most sense and will let us move on.
REBECCA: Griffin is not
the guy that you think
he is, all right?
I hardly even had to try.
That was not his first time.
Okay? Please...
Please, just call me back.
100 bucks she comes home without her underwear again and brags about screwing some lacrosse player
(MOCKINGLY) with the prettiest penis ever.
(NORMAL VOICE)
Like, what penis is ever pretty?
(LAUGHS)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Uh... Hi. Can I help you?
Emily Sinclair.
I'm the new prosecutor on the Sam
Keating murder trial.
Do you have time for a few questions?
Uh, about... About what?
Annalise, mostly.
Not that that should surprise you.
So, can I come in, or would you rather us do this at the police station?
ANNALISE: Say it.
Say it, and it will become true.
Sam killed Lila.
Sam killed...
REBECCA: Lila!
Look, don't ignore me if you're up here.
MICHAELA: Well, look who finally made it.
I'm on my third.
You need to catch up.
I figure if "Eggs
911" and Rebecca are about to take us all down and this is our last night of freedom,
I want to be drunk enough to take home one of those bankers.
Michaela...
How the hell do you have that?
I found it Connor's car as soon as you said you'd lost it.
You were a disaster that night.
I could tell you wanted to go to the police, but I knew if you thought they could find it, you'd stay quiet.
REBECCA: Fine.
Ignore me.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
CONNOR: Oliver?
What's the matter?
Are you sick?
OLIVER:
Depends on what you mean.
(SNIFFLES)
I was gonna tell you when you called, but you didn't have your results yet.
And I thought maybe you'd have it, too.
(VOICE BREAKING)
And that we'd be in this together.
Oliver...
I tested positive.
REBECCA: Look, I know you're up there. Just...
Just let me explain, please, why...
(GRUNTS)
No, no, no!
Don't be dead!
Please don't be dead!
No, no, no!
(SNIFFLES)
I haven't felt this way in a long time, and I don't ever want to not feel this way again.
It's you,
Lila.
I love you.
I should go now.
What? Already?
I need to tell
Annalise right now.
I'll call you when it's done.
SAM: It's Sam.
I need you to do what we talked about.
You owe me.
(GASPS)
(GASPING)
(GASPING CONTINUES)
ASHER: Okay.
If Frank's not a lawyer,
then what is he?
Is he Annalise's bodyguard?
(GASPING)
FRANK:
I know you said not to worry,
but she's snooping around everywhere.
You want me to handle it, just say the word.
(GASPING)
Is that what you think I am?
Some freaking hit man?
(GASPING STOPS)
ANNALISE: Sam killed Lila.
ANNALISE AND WES:
Sam killed Lila.
Sam killed Lila.
Sam killed Lila.
Sam killed Lila.
Sam killed Lila.
Sam killed Lila.
Sam killed Lila.
See? Doesn't that feel better?
(SIGHS) I don't know.
It will soon.
(SIGHS)
Shh.
I promise you, Wes.
I got you.
(LID CLOSES)
Rebecca?
If we don't find her?
Don't worry. We will.
(DOOR OPENING)
(DOOR CLOSES)
Was it you?
FRANK: No.
Annalise, you know I'm not that guy.
Besides, I thought it was you.
Because I'm that guy?
Of course not.
Now what?

## S02E1

Previously on season one of
"How to Get Away With Murder"...
A woman's body was found inside the Kappa Kappa Theta house.
- What happened?
- My student.
They found her in one of those water tanks.
I bet you the boyfriend did it.
There was nothing going on with me and that girl.
I need you to do what we talked about.
If Frank's not a lawyer, then what is he?
The female suspect,
Rebecca sutter, arrested.
Rebecca! Don't say anything!
I didn't kill her.
Plug it into his computer. It'll download all his phone information.
Call Wes.
Unlock the door, Rebecca.
I said open the damn door!
You have to get here right now!
- Get out of my house.
- Let her go, then we'll leave.
- Get off!
- Grab it!
Laurel!
Call an ambulance.
Why? He's dead.
Oh, my God!
Get him off her! Do something!!
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.
You listen to me closely and do exactly as I tell you.
Remove the body.
My engagement ring is gone!
- Michaela...
- How the hell do you have that?
You were a disaster that night. I could tell you wanted to go to the police.
- You recognize this ring?
- I gave it to my husband on our wedding day.
- Any idea why we found it in the woods?
- I'm on it.
Former Philadelphia detective Nate Lahey was arrested
in connection with the death of professor Sam Keating.
Just call the damn number.
- Annalise Keating gave me your number.
- Emily Sinclair.
I'm the new prosecutor assigned to the Nate Lahey case.
Do you have time for a few questions?
Or would you rather us do this at the police station?
So, I want your word you're not gonna tell A.K. about me and Bonnie.
- Bonnie and Asher?
- Gives you the heebie jeebies, right?
Oliver? What's the matter?
Are you sick?
I tested positive.
She texted someone.
"Eggs 911. Lawyer's house."
Tell us the damn truth, Rebecca.
Did you... Kill... Lila?
You just need to tell me what happened that night.
Rebecca! Who was it?
Who let her go, damn it?!
I didn't let her go.
You have to believe me.
Sam killed Lila.
It's the version of the truth that makes the most sense.
Say it, and it will become true.
Sam killed Lila.
- Was it you?
- No.
- I thought it was you.
- Of course not.
Now what?
No. No, you don't have to do this.
You don't have to do this.
You don't. I'll be good.
I'll be good.
I'll be so good!
Statistically, if you're going to be murdered, your killer will be someone you know...
An acquaintance, a friend, a family member...
Your lover.
- _
- Why is that?
Why are we more inclined to hurt the ones we love the most?
And what challenges does that present a defense attorney?
Mr. Walsh?
The challenge for the defense attorney is that...
You were saying?
Right. Um, the challenge is that sometimes the police only look at loved ones when trying to find a suspect.
- Now what?
- Get rid of her.
Don't tell me how or where...
Just take care of it.
It's a big uphill battle if your client knew the murder victim.
So your best strategy is to... Find a different acquaintance to pin it on?
But before you do that?
Miss Pratt.
Attack the police investigation.
Use the idea that they're so used to thinking it's the husband or boyfriend that they fail to look at other suspects.
I'm glad someone showed up to class today.
- _
Here.
It's Sam's.
You know, whoever did this had to be strong enough to drag her behind the stairs.
A person can lift almost anything if they're desperate enough.
The defense won Commonwealth v. Ferber by proving the police had bias.
Detectives' records even showed they never considered other suspects other than Mr. Ferber.
Now, what if your client is the spouse of the murder victim and you know he did it?
What would be your defense strategy...
Mr. Gibbins?
No one can find out about this, Frank...
Especially Wes.
He can never know.
What if he already knows?
'Cause he did it.
- Mr. Gibbins?
- Pass.
I'm not Professor Hahn.
No one passes in my class.
I just did.
It wasn't him.
You sure about that?
I mean, after Sam, and do we really believe the story about his mom killing herself?
Wes didn't do this!
Okay.
Stand up.
50 bucks says he poops his pants before she's done with him.
You come to my class late and then you flaunt, in my face, that you're unprepared.
Either way, this doesn't mean that we can't use this opportunity to exercise your brain.
So, think.
What would be a good defense for a spouse who's killed his lover?
Pass.
Mr. Gibbins...
I don't know the answer.
That's what "pass" means.
So either keep wasting everyone's time or move on... Your choice.

Were you drunk in class today, or did you finally grow a pair after your girlfriend ran away?
I'm sorry... after you let her run away.
- Yeah. After I let her run away.
- I knew it.
Waitlist, let Rebecca go.
- Don't joke about that, Wes.
- "Don't joke about that, Wes."
Who says it's a joke?
Maybe I did let her go.
But you didn't, so just stop saying that.
- "Stop saying that."
- Michaela!
Oh, you want me to stop being annoying?
Then stop being a sociopath who steals engagement rings.
Mm. She's got you there.
I'm team Michaela on this one.
- Never forget it.
- Fine.
So, you're just gonna do that and hate me for the rest of our lives?
Lives?
Are you kidding me?
I'm not gonna know you next year.
Fine.
At least admit it kept you quiet.
Okay, you do realize I'm not scared to hit a bitch.
Oh, just throw me down the stairs.
You did a pretty good job with Sam.
Hey!
Hey!
You think I got time to be your freaking nanny? Shut your traps and get to work.
We don't have any work.
Today's the preliminary hearing for Caleb and Catherine Hapstall,
the adopted siblings accused of torturing and murdering their parents.
I finally heard back from A.D.A. Sinclair.
She says you'll be the first witness in Nate...
Quiet.
The hearing comes just three months since Grant and Ursula Hapstall,
owners of billion- dollar-valued
Hapstall pharmaceuticals,
were bound, gagged, and shot to death inside their main line mansion.
My clients had nothing to do with this violent, horrific crime.
I'm confident the judge will agree and not let this go to trial.
You don't know how to get a case thrown out in a preliminary, jackass.
We need to talk...
Alone.
- I have other things to discuss.
- Bonnie.
It's freaking "Lord of the Flies" out there.
- They're scared.
- But is it true?
The puppy went attack dog on you today?
Acting out in class doesn't make him a killer, Frank.
Where you going?
To get us a murder case that didn't happen in this house.
The worst part of a murder charge in Pennsylvania...
The death penalty is still legal.
So if I were a hardworking, low-income parent, like most of the people on a Philadelphia jury,
I'd relish giving you the needle.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Rich, spoiled, and ungrateful for the privilege you were born into...
Sorry, adopted into.
You need to leave.
You don't deserve the money.
You're not their real children.
You felt that growing up. And it made you resentful, angry, and then you decided, "enough.
- Let's shoot mommy and daddy in the head."
- I'm getting security.
Caleb, wait.
Who are you?
The lawyer you should've hired in the first place.
Annalise Keating, of course!
How was her pitch?
Did she tell you that she made her boyfriend kill her husband yet?
Call me when he screws up.
We're gonna make him screw up.
Manipulate Victor into making a mistake so big in court that Catherine and Caleb will have no other choice but to fire him and hire us.
Wait. Why would we want their loser case?
Their aunt saw them leave the murder scene...
You're late.
And since when don't you like a challenge, Mr. Millstone?
What about Rebecca's case, though?
Like...
If that gets going again?
Rebecca's case is over.
But that firm is huge.
Which is why it'll be that much more fun to take them down.
What... you need a trophy to do your job?
Then quit.
You think you deserve to be here, that your job is safe?
You're here because
I let you be here.
So do your work or get the hell out of my house!
I'd probably do what she says.
What... you still don't like surprises?
- How dare you.
- Oh, relax.
- They can't know about this.
- They can't? What about me?
Am I allowed to know what's going on?
- Haven't you talked to Nate?
- Yes, he called, but he seemed just as confused as to why I'd ever represent him.
And I tried to connect the dots, follow whatever crumbs you think you left, but the only explanation that makes any sense...
If you can say that... Is that the two of you killed your husband!
That's Eve Rothlo, right?
- Who's Eve Rothlo?
- Go away.
- Why is she here?
- How does she know Annalise?
- Again, who is this lady?
- She's a death-row attorney.
- She founded the exoneration group.
- Oh, so she's a liberal.
No wonder I don't know who she is.
- Will you please lower your voice?
- Why?
Because I'm right...
You're a killer?
Nate didn't do it.
Are you saying that just
'cause he's your boyfriend?
He's not my boyfriend.
Mm, I'm sure.
I looked him up, by the way.
Saw those sad eyes.
And that body?
But I said to myself, "don't do it, Eve.
Block his number, because if this was actually important to Annalise, she'd contact you herself."
You know I couldn't do that.
I know nothing except for the fact that this is insane.
Who does this, Annalise...
Barely speaks to someone for years, avoids them even, then reaches out via stranger?
- I had no one else to call.
- You didn't call.
So that there would be no record of contact between us.
Because there's something to hide?
Tell me, Annalise, did the two of you do this together?
- No.
- You paid Nate to do it?
- No.
- You blackmailed him?
- Tell me what happened.
- I can't.
All right. Then I'm leaving.
Listen, there is nothing that I can tell you to help you win Nate's case.
I won't win his case because I'm not taking it.
Can you just do this for me, please?!
Just do it for you, because we're so close?
He's innocent, right?
I promise you that. I promise.
- No.
- Eve...
This isn't court, Annalise.
You can't play me.
Then why did you come here, huh?
It wasn't just to tell me no, right?
You want to help me.
I hate you so much.
So, Annalise wants you to trick their lawyer
- into making a mistake in court...
- Oliver.
So she can then swoop in and represent the two crazies who tied up and shot their parents in cold blood?
- Hey.
- You know they did it, right?
I mean, they claim they didn't hear anything, but they were inside the house at the time of the murder.
Look up, damn it!
Connor, no! We have to wait.
Yeah, for sex sex, but we can do other stuff.
I can't.
Well, can you at least help a brother out?
Oh, so this wasn't about us at all...
- This was about you getting off.
- No.
And here I was, so generously trying to help you do your job.
My job's a train wreck right now, and, yes, I admit it...
My penis is really craving an orgasm. I'm sorry.
You don't get it.
I'm not going to be able to enjoy any sex if I'm worried I'm putting you in danger.
- I'm on prep.
- You have two more weeks before it works, not to mention you can't know for sure if you really want this.
By "this," do you mean you?
Because I do know that.
Look, I'm not going to leave you just because of something that's not that big of a deal anymore.
It is a big deal!
Okay, maybe...
Maybe not for you, but for me...
It's a big deal.
I'm sorry.
I just...
I really want to be here, more than anything, even if that means being celibate for  14 more days.
Well, 13 days.
You took your first pill at 9:30 last Sunday, so technically, it's 13 days from now, not 14.
He's doing it again...
Searching Jane Does just like he did last two nights.
So?
- So it means he knows Rebecca's dead.
- Or he's just afraid that she's dead.
Are you spying on each of them, or Wes is the only one you're trying to pin this on?
You think I killed Rebecca?
You're very eager to blame this on a young man that you have no solid evidence on.
So... Did you?
I won't be mad if you did it. I'll just be mad that you're lying.
Annalise, you know I just talk a big game.
I'll clone all their computers, see if anything weird comes up.
Wait.
If you're right, that it was
Wes, I have a way to find out.
Are we ever gonna have this out, or are you gonna keep punishing me until I figure out exactly what's been bothering you?
Nothing's been bothering me.
Well, you were pretty upset with me in class yesterday.
I'd been up all night working on a paper.
I was tired, I guess.
- Sorry.
- Apology accepted.
- Is that all?
- No.
We know where Rebecca is.
Frank found her at the Third
Street Motel in West Philly.
I'm telling you so you know we're keeping an eye on her and that you were right...
She's kept quiet, no visits to the police.
- Thank you for telling me.
- Just don't tell the others.
I don't want to have to walk in someplace and find her tied up again.
Laurel's got something on the Hapstall case.
It's the surveillance footage of the aunt who saw them the night of the murder.
- So, any news on Rebecca?
- I'm not Frank, Laurel.
You can't twirl your hair and make me tell you things.
I'm not asking because I'm being nosy.
This affects all of us.
No, this affects all of you.
I didn't make this mess, so don't you dare include me in it.
You don't know anything either, do you?
No.
Annalise just talks to
Frank about these things.
There. That's her.
You're a lawyer for the
Hapstall siblings, right?
Whatever this is, it's inappropriate.
I-I work at a spa their aunt goes to.
She wasn't where she says she was the night of the murders.
Miss Hapstall, can you tell us where you were the night of November 4th?
In the guest house on the estate.
I've been staying there while my house is being renovated.
And what happened around 9:30 that night?
I was reading a terrific book about Nixon when I heard screaming coming from the mansion.
I went to my window... It faces the master suite of the mansion.
The master suite where your brother Grant and his wife Ursula were found dead
- by the housekeeper the next morning.
- Yes.
I looked out the window for some time, hoping that everything was okay, when I saw them.
Your niece and nephew.
They ran by the master window, and there was no more screaming after that.
I assumed it was nothing.
But when the police came the next morning, I knew they had done it.
Your witness.
One question...
You said you saw my clients run by the window at around 9:30, correct?
Yes.
Your Honor, I would like to submit into evidence surveillance footage from the Gladness
Spa on November 4th.
Objection. We're not aware of any new evidence.
My team only just uncovered this footage, Your Honor.
The prosecution will have ample time to authenticate it.
Agreed.
Let's see it.
Can you read me the time-stamp on the monitor, Miss Hapstall?
9:56 p.m., November 4th.
And who is this person now exiting their spa treatment?
Well... I believe that's me.
- How'd court go?
- So far, so good.
Let's hope phase two works just as well.
Millstone.
Hey, lover boy.
Your girlfriend wants you.
What? How... how'd you know that she's my girlfriend?
Oh. We didn't, until you just admitted it.
Freaking dumb-ass, Asher!
Hey.
Did you know that they all know?
It's fine. I'll handle them.
So,
I'm getting off early tonight.
Come over.
You can see my place finally.
Tonight?
Uh, I have to study for our civ pro exams.
I'm, like  really stressed.
I'll help to de-stress you.
I-I can't tonight.
Um, maybe... Maybe next week?
Um...
- Where's the puppy?
- Just left for the library. Why?
- Frank.
- Busy.
It's about eggs 911.
She texted someone.
"Eggs 911. Lawyer's house."
I should get a new cell number, right?
In case whoever Rebecca texted tries to find me.
Why would they want to find you?
So they can find out what happened to Rebecca.
What do you mean
"what happened to Rebecca"?
We... we taped her up and held her hostage.
- What's going on, Frank?
- Nothing. Relax.
I already got your number unlisted.
You change it now, and the police ever learn Rebecca's M.I.A., it'll look suspicious you changed it the same time.
So I just wait around until whoever it is texts me back?
Sit on the grenade. Exactly.
Come on. Just go to the motel.
Prove to me you're not a psycho killer.
So, you admit to being with Annalise the night Sam was killed, then?
I think Sam killed Lila.
She came here, you said in your original police statement?
Yeah.
You didn't go to her house before or after?
No.
I don't like you, Nate, not the way you're acting.
It's like you want to go away for this, which is very likely, what with the whole "black man accused of killing the white husband" thing.
White folks...
Always bringing up race when it suits them, never when it matters.
You don't trust me...
That I get.
So, ask me what you want to know.
How do you know Annalise?
We were the same year at Harvard Law.
- That all?
- We were good friends.
So, put yourself in my shoes.
The woman who framed me tells me to replace my lawyer with her friend, and I'm just supposed to trust that it's in my best interest?
What do you mean, framed you?
Hi.
This was part of your plan, right?
- What do you mean?
- Your friend turned down my case.
What? No.
I begged her to see you.
You set me up for a murder you probably committed yourself, and now whatever the hell this is!
But it's over.
And, yeah, I may go to jail, but I'm gonna make damn sure
I take you down with me.
Nate, listen, I can fix this.
- Now who's doing the avoiding?
- We can't be seen together.
Only if you take Nate's case, which you're not.
- That's true... I'm not.
- Tell me why.
I thought you could figure that part out yourself.
What does that mean?
What does it mean?!
You framed him!
- My God, you're not even denying it!
- I'll explain if you just...
I gave you the chance to explain.
You just lied to my face.
- Is that what he said?
- I'm not doing this, Annalise.
I'm not letting you ruin me the way you ruined him.
That's why I asked you here, to fix this.
And risk my entire career in the process.
Did you really think
I would do that, that I wouldn't remember how familiar this all feels?
You don't get to do this anymore.
You don't get to use people and expect them to stick around.
Maybe this is who you've always been and I was just blind to it.
All that ambition to make up for the fact that you knew, deep down, there is nothing good inside of you.
Shame on me for expecting more.
But I won't do it again, Annalise.
Stay away from me, or I'll scream bloody murder.
Is that the gin island refresher?
Vodka Martini.
I don't do mixology.
Right. If it ain't broke...
So, um, do you work nearby, or are you staying at the hotel?
- I work nearby.
- Nice.
What do you do?
Men.
I'm gay, and I can tell you're hitting on me, which is really flattering.
Believe me, I'd be all about you if I were into women.
Uh-huh. Go away now.
_
_
Miss Hapstall, how often do you go to the Gladness Spa?
Once a week.
I've got a herniated disk.
How we doing?
Massage seems to be the only thing that helps.
We're about to see.
Any news on Rebecca?
- And did you get a massage on November 4th?
- We're not talking about this here.
That depends on the year you're referring to.
If you mean 2013, then, yes, but if you mean 2014, then I was at home witnessing my niece and nephew murder their parents.
Remind the witness that she's still under oath, Your Honor.
Judge, I have here the original surveillance footage from November 4th, except for, this time, it's not doctored.
Objection!
Let's see the evidence before losing our heads.
On the left is the footage
Mr. Leshner showed in court.
On the right is the undoctored footage.
On the left, the time stamp shows no year, but on the right, the year 2013.
There. Now it's whatever year we say it is.
The defense manipulated this footage, Your Honor.
That is a ridiculous accusation!
I'm not sure I believe that, Mr.
Leshner. My chambers, now.
- Was this you?
- Of course not.
Whoever gave us that footage...
That bitch.
Hey.
I'll meet you outside.
Our puppy trap came up empty.
- No.
- He never went to the motel.
In what world doesn't he at least look for the girl, Annalise?
Want me to sit him down, make him spill it?
I'll do it.
Okay, but you need me there in case he freaks out.
- He won't.
- We don't know that anymore.
I know how to handle him, Frank.
Don't worry.
Do you like red wine? Sam bought this bottle in Sonoma a few years ago.
It's supposed to be good, is all I know.
I think I was too drunk at the wine tasting to remember.
Here. Open it.
You don't have to do this.
- Cook?
- Please.
I don't do it as much as I'd like.
I know what you did.
Rebecca's not at a motel.
You just made up you found her to see if I'd go look for her.
You can tell me anything.
I'll protect you, always.
I didn't let her go.
I told you that.
And I believe you.
But you're afraid I'm gonna try and find her.
Do you want to find her?
Of course, but I'm not pathetic.
She ran away, after I told her I believed her and after everything I did for her.
Sam. And she still didn't trust me.
Instead, she chose to run away.
I have to respect that decision.
I'll get over her soon...
I promise.
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
I'm sorry I was mean in class.
_
Is there a girl in there?
- No. And how is that any...
- Rebecca's dead...
Isn't she?
- Why do you think that?
- Because it's true... She's dead.
Why do you think that?
She'd have gone to the police if she was still alive, but she didn't because she's dead.
And now none of us need to worry, right?
You need to go.
But... you're making up stories 'cause you got too much time on your hands.
So go home, open a book, and act like a normal law student for once.
But...
If Rebecca talks to the police, we all go down. You're gonna take care of it?
You think I'm gonna whack Rebecca?
It's Laurel.
She's always sticking her head where it doesn't belong, asking questions that don't concern her.
She lied to me about the trophy that night, stole prom queen's ring.
She even suggested I kill Rebecca that day.
It's like you say...
It's always the ones you least suspect, you know, the quiet ones.
It makes sense with her background, too.
Her father... you don't grow up to be normal when that's who raises you.
No, you become messed up.
You're wrong.
I wish I was, Annalise, but it's Laurel.
No, it's not.
You've got the wrong girl.
Hi.
Is everything okay?
No, everything is not.
Please... I believe her.
- We have to let her go.
- What?
We have gone above and beyond here to try to fix this for all of you.
Rebecca!
Who was it? Who let her go?
Who let her go, damn it?!
Hey.
I figured you'd be thirsty.
Yeah.
Thanks.
So, good news.
Annalise has decided to let you go.
Why?
She doesn't think you killed Lila.
And she trusts that you'll keep everything we've done for you a secret.
Yeah? Well, she's right.
Look, I just got scared...
That's all.
I'm...
I'm not gonna tell anybody anything, I swear.
Wes didn't ask for any of this.
I-I don't want to hurt him anymore.
I promise... I promise...
I'm not a bad person.
I know.
I tell myself that, too.
"You're a good person, Bonnie.
You deserve a normal life...
Even if people said you didn't.
They're wrong.
You're a... Good person."
Bad things happened to me, too...
The worst things.
The difference is,
I don't use them as an excuse.
I grew up, stopped playing the victim.
And then I definitely don't keep the cycle going...
Hurt people because they hurt me...
Kill a girl.
No, no.
I didn't... I didn't kill Lila.
I don't believe you.
Uh...
You need to go.
No, no, no, no.
Listen. Listen to me.
You don't have to do this.
No, you don't. I'll be good.
I'll be good! I'll be so good...
I'm so sorry.
- She was innocent.
- We don't know that.
She started all of this.
And she'd have kept dragging all of us down with her.
You lied to me, let me think this was Wes.
Frank thought it was Laurel because of who she grew up around, but that was you.
You're the one sick enough to do this.
I didn't know how to tell you.
Because you knew I'd be ashamed of you.
You were in trouble...
More than you even knew.
So I did what you would've done for me.
- Don't you dare put this on me.
- It's true... I did it for you.
You did it for Sam! You still need him to be that man...
Good, kind, and someone who could even love you, but that's not who he was, Bonnie!
And now you're just as bad as him.
- I'm not.
- You are!
Now that you've done this, you're a monster...
Just like him!
Let's get you a drink.
You live here alone?
You didn't come here to ask me about my personal life.
You were right.
I ruin people.
You mean Nate?
Everyone.
That's a little melodramatic, don't you think?
Only if you don't know me.
I know you...
Even if it's been a long time.
Well, I was the same back then.
I did it to you.
- You did not ruin me.
- I hurt you.
It's all part of the game, right?
And I'm doing okay.
I don't sit here thinking about you every day, crying into my pillow how you left me for your therapist.
Hell, at least you married him.
I'm sorry I called.
You can trust me, Annalise.
Even if what Nate said is true?
I did it.
I framed him.
Because you killed Sam?
Because I'm protecting the person who did.
Does this person deserve your protection?
Yes.
Yeah.
Then you're doing what you think is right.
Sometimes that has to be enough.
Oh, look at me... A hot mess coming to your apartment in tears.
Oh, like I'm not used to it with you.
- Oh, please, I never...
- Are you kidding? It was constant.
Oh, you're making it up.
After you lost your mock trial, when that D.A. told you he was scared of you.
- Oh, he was a bastard.
- I agree with you.
And I'm not saying it was all tears all the time.
- Yeah.
- We had our fun, too.
Remember those dinner parties at Al's, dancing all night at that Brazilian bar?
- You were fun, Annalise.
- I was, wasn't I?
Okay. Um, let's put you to bed.
I set up the guest room.
I'm so sorry.
No.
Don't you dare apologize.
I lied.
I think about you every day.
Do you think we did it?
That's not a question I ever ask my clients.
But clearly, you have an opinion?
No. Listen, you want to say you're innocent.
I understand that.
Research shows that juries more likely will acquit if they've heard the defendant say, "I'm innocent." But I'm not on your jury.
We are innocent.
We loved our parents, and not because of all this, but because they loved us.
Then someone killed them, and now they're trying to blame us.
- You think you were framed?
- Don't you?
What about your husband's murder trial?
Won't you be too distracted to take on a big case like this?
No, because I'm not on trial for his murder.
- But you're a suspect.
- Some people say that.
But consider the facts... What if
I did do it, killed my husband?
Like I said, I'm not on trial.
What'd I tell you, Frank?
They're in.
Your Honor, any change to counsel this late could result in a mistrial.
If Ms. Sinclair's suggesting I'll be so bad at my job that I'll lose this trial, then rest assured...
I plan to win this the first time around.
I'm glad Ms. Rothlo is so confident, but any delay...
I agree, which is why
I'm allowing this change only if Ms. Rothlo can stick to the start date.
I've won death-penalty cases on shorter notice.
Congratulations, Mr. Lahey.
You've got yourself a new lawyer.
- I don't understand.
- I'm moving in.
What? I never said that you...
You're worried how serious I am about us.
Well, here's how serious I am, because right now, you are the only part of my day that I look forward to.
- Yeah, but, uh...
- Oli, it's done, okay?
I'm already subletting my place.
So, deal with it.
We are officially a boring, domesticated, cohabitating...
Couple.
Don't answer it.
- It's my Annalise ringtone.
- Oh, God. Answer it.
Hello?
Where the hell is she taking us?
I think the point is that we don't know.
Or she's just about to off us.
You'd get no warning if I was gonna off you, Mr. Walsh.
You've all been through hell.
So have I.
It's a miracle we're still standing.
But tonight, we're gonna forget about all that.
To having some fun!
Screw it.
I don't know who that person is.
I don't believe you.
I've never seen her before, okay?
And this is how bad I am at this spy crap...
Like, I'm afraid to hang out with my girlfriend,
'cause I know that I'm gonna tell her everything.
I know what happened at Trotter Lake, Asher.
So why don't we do this again?
Have you seen this woman before?
Yeah.
Um... She stopped by the house the other day.
Annalise's house?
- Dance with me!
- Over my dead body.
I'm sorry, Michaela.
I shouldn't have taken the ring!
I just didn't know you then, but I know you now.
I know I can trust you.
So, please, just accept my apology so we can move on.
- I don't want to move on.
- "I don't want to move on."
Ow! Stop it!
Let me go!
- Wes, watch my bag!
- Whoo!
_
We're live on the scene tonight, where police have just now discovered a woman's body inside her car.
Sources tell us that the victim is none other than Helena Hapstall...
I was at home, witnessing my niece and nephew murder their parents.
It was just days ago that Miss Hapstall
took the stand against her niece and nephew,
testifying that she personally saw and heard
Caleb and Catherine fleeing the scene of their parents' murder.
The question detectives must now ask
is whether this was a random act of violence or related to the upcoming siblings' trial.
- You starting a new one?
- I didn't know you went out.
Just a run to de-stress.
I like it.
Thanks.
You can't turn down a woman who asks you to dance.
But I have to watch
Michaela's bag.
Wes, stop.
You can't beat yourself up anymore.
It's time to move on.
So, come on.
Prove to me that you can do it.
_
Statistically, if you're going to be murdered, your killer will be someone you know... an acquaintance, a friend, a family member...
Your lover. why is that?

"How to Get Away with Murder"...
Now that you've done this, you're a monster!
I won't win his case
'cause I'm not taking it.
Can you just do this for me, please?
- How do you know Annalise?
- We were good friends.
I think about you every day.
Congratulations, Mr. Lahey.
You've got yourself a new lawyer.
Have you seen this woman before?
Yeah.
I'm moving in.
Caleb and Catherine Hapstall
accused of torturing and
murdering their parents.
I was at home, witnessing my niece and nephew murder their parents.
- You think you were framed?
- Don't you?
Police have just now discovered a woman's body inside her car... none other than Helena Hapstall.
You can't beat yourself up anymore.
It's time to move on.
Wes.
- Where's Connor?
- We thought you had him.
Oh, my God, they're gonna be here any minute.
- We can't leave without him.
- Fine, but where the hell is he?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This is your fault.
It's always your fault.
What idiot hires a new lawyer then murders their aunt?
- Rich idiots.
- What is she doing here?
- She saw the news first.
- Why aren't you in with them?
The siblings only gave your name, so the sergeant won't let me in.
Well, you didn't try hard enough.
Why are we here?
I'll tell you if tell me where you were earlier tonight.
I'm not talking until my lawyer is here.
How's my sister?
If you do anything to her,
I swear to God...
Oh, no.
You keep going with that.
I'd love to get a threat on camera.
Catherine, your silence right now is telling me that you weren't at home.
I didn't say that.
Okay. What about your brother?
Where was he tonight?
I didn't know you went out.
Just a run to de-stress.
Just answer that one question... then we'll tell you what you've been arrested for.
Game over, detective.
Your aunt was murdered earlier tonight.
Oh, my God.
How did she die?
Her throat was cut.
So we've been arrested for her murder?
I don't know.
The warrant's sealed.
They won't tell us till your arraignment.
They can do that?
Because you're already facing a murder charge, yes.
Please.
Please don't tell me you think we're dumb enough to kill the only eyewitness in our own trial.
We don't know each other well enough yet.
We didn't do this, okay?
If anything, this proves someone's framing us.
Okay.
Where were you earlier tonight?
At home.
We've been together all night.
Catherine, is that true?
Of course.
We were both home. http://www.TeslaVid.eu - Watch TV-series online
Your girlfriend's gone M.I.A. on me, bro.
Hasn't paid rent in three months.
She's not my girlfriend.
Oh, no. She ghost you?
It's not like that.
I have to get to work.
Okay, but do you want to go through her stuff before I throw it out?
I don't want anything of hers, so...
Move, please.
The arraignment of the siblings is in 72 hours.
We have to establish an alibi in order to get the charges thrown out.
An alibi for the night that their parents were killed or their aunt?
I'm just trying to keep track.
There's so many murders.
Alleged murders, and we're only dealing with the aunt today.
Frank, try to get a copy of the sealed warrant.
Bonnie? With me.
You're running point on Caleb and Catherine, and don't you dare smile.
The only reason why
I haven't fired you is 'cause I can't be in two places at once.
You screw up again, you're gonna be the next dead body in this house.
That about Nate's trial?
No. Why?
Oh, no reason. I just...
I like when you're the big boss lady of the house.
You get to make the rules,
I get to abide.
__
Someone sext you a peen pic?
Uh, I was just looking up what judge is presiding over Nate's hearing.
Michaela, you are not going to Nate's hearing.
I never said I was.
Okay, I can't be the only one who wants to go.
You want us, the real murderers, to go to the fake murderer's trial?
- Annalise would kill us.
- I'd kill you.
Why are we killing each other?
Uh, Oliver is HIV-positive.
And Laurel was just saying that she would kill me if I had sex with him before my prep kicks in.
Wait, he has HIV, and you're gonna have sex with him?
Yes. Lots of sex.
Dude, no.
Look, I get the o-man probably has a really sweet ass and all, but you could, like, die.
This reminds me of that time in the library parking lot and Professor Carson walked by...
Is Nate gonna do it?
- Do what?
- Lie on the stand, say that he fought with Sam that night.
Okay, I may have agreed to this insane situation, but I did not agree to break my client's confidentiality with you.
What confidentiality?
The only way he wins is if he follows my plan.
You mean my plan.
I'm his attorney, Annalise, and I'm very good at my job.
So stop trying to micromanage.
I'm sorry.
Do you love him?
He's innocent.
That's not what I asked.
I care for him.
And none of this can affect the way you defend him...
What did I just say about you micromanaging?
You're freaked out, aren't you?
About the other night.
Don't worry.
It doesn't have to mean anything.
We just...
Had fun.
Well, at least I did.
So did I.
This is crazy, Annalise.
I mean, I want to say I feel bad, or at least a little bit guilty, but...
No wonder everyone's having affairs.
Calling case number 09682,
Commonwealth vs. Lahey.
Probable cause hearing in the death of Samuel Keating.
Commonwealth, are you ready to proceed?
Yes, Your Honor.
But first, I'd like to say there might be cause to not have this hearing today.
- Why's that, counselor?
- Annalise Keating, the victim's wife, has had a long-standing relationship with the defendant's attorney.
Your Honor, I believe Ms. Sinclair is referring to the fact that Ms. Keating and I were classmates at Harvard Law...
They're friends, Your Honor.
Ms. Rothlo, please explain the extent of your relationship with Ms. Keating.
Don't spare any details.
We were acquaintances in law school, yes, as I was with the 1,500 other
Harvard Law students at the time.
I also recall the both of us consulting on a federal case 10 years ago.
10 years?
- Nothing more recent?
- Nothing.
And I welcome any investigations into whatever Ms. Sinclair is insinuating.
No insinuations. Just facts.
Fact... Ms. Rothlo willfully neglected to disclose her relationship...
If I had to disclose the names of all my classmates
I've gone up against in court,
I'd never have time to argue another case.
- This is clearly collusion.
- Let's maintain our composure.
Oh, I suppose I'd be colluding with Ms. Sinclair, too, if she'd been able to get into Harvard.
I am requesting you remove Ms. Rothlo and sanction both her and Ms. Keating...
Ms. Sinclair is the one in need of sanctions, if not a tranquilizer.
- Enough!
- Because what this reveals about this case is that
Annalise Keating helped Mr. Lahey commit her husband's murder.
Researching your next murder?
Smart to use a plastic bag, by the way.
Made the clean-up easier.
Please don't.
I can't take anyone else beating me up.
I'm not beating anyone up.
I'm just trying to understand what you were thinking.
I mean, at least tell me.
Because you would have told me if it was you?
Exactly.
She's gonna get over it.
Speak of the devil.
Hey.
The D.A. found out that Eve and I know each other.
Of course.
That chick's so annoying.
Find out what else she knows.
I don't want any more surprises.
Unclench. Everything's fine.
How do you think that Sinclair got the 411 about A.K. and Eve?
Annalise has been humiliating the D.A.'s office for years.
This is just them retaliating.
Okay, but, I mean, don't you ever worry about all the illegal crap we do?
I mean, you could get disbarred, or worse...
I'm fine.
So, will you stop worrying, or do I need to take you into one of these empty rooms to make you relax?
Miss Guthrie, hi.
We're the...
The lawyers. I know.
I won't lie for them.
Lie? No.
We just want to know if you saw
Catherine and Caleb the night
Helena was killed.
No.
No one on my staff did.
In fact, Caleb told us all to take that night off early.
Is the prosecution prepared to call their first witness?
We are, Your Honor.
Annalise Keating.
And due to the circumstances,
I'll be treating her as a hostile witness.
I'll have no need to be hostile if she stops acting like I'm the one on trial here, Your Honor.
You watch yourself,
Ms. Keating.
You're a material witness here today, nothing more.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
She just looked right at me.
Stop. There's no way she can see us.
If you both keep talking, she will.
Ms. Keating, is it true you first met Mr. Lahey on one of your cases?
He was the detective that the prosecution put on the stand during one of my trials, yes.
Was the attraction immediate in the courtroom?
I can't speak for Mr. Lahey, but I was focused on winning my case, which I did.
So when exactly did your attraction begin?
Over drinks at a bar.
Was this weeks or months after you cross-examined him?
- I don't remember the exact timing.
- Okay.
Do you recall the first time after these drinks you and Mr. Lahey had sex?
Let the slut-shaming begin.
I don't remember.
Mr. Lahey says it happened that very same night in a bathroom stall at the bar, in fact.
Your Honor, Ms. Sinclair is testifying instead of the witness.
The hostile witness.
I'm allowed to ask leading questions.
Ask the questions, yes, not answer them yourself.
Are you objecting in order to protect your client or in order to protect Ms. Keating?
Let's not go down this road again, counselors.
And I agree with Ms. Sinclair.
The questions seem fair given the witness' status.
So at the time of your first sexual encounter with Mr. Lahey, were you aware that his wife had just been diagnosed with stage-four ovarian cancer?
Did all that naked Nate talk make anyone else horny?
I mean, obviously not you, since you probably have been having sexy time with Rebecca
- in your apartment this whole time.
- Connor...
- He doesn't even deny it.
- You want to blame this on me, fine.
It's all my fault, but for the last time,
I don't know or care where Rebecca is.
Screw Oliver already if it makes you stop being such an ass.
Excuse me. My phone died.
Can I borrow one of yours?
Uh, yeah, yeah, you can borrow mine.
Uh, he has a boyfriend.
His name's Oliver, and he's wonderful.
What about you? Boyfriend?
'Cause, uh, this is just a ploy for me to sneak my number into your phone.
Levi.
She doesn't have a boyfriend.
Um, actually, I do.
She's lying.
- Connor.
- It's okay.
I get it. You're not interested.
- Uh...
- She totally is.
I'm not. Sorry.
What the hell? He's hot.
And he's probably in a courthouse because he's a criminal.
Well, you don't have to take him home to meet the parents.
You just have to sit on him.
Come on, do it.
Do it for me. Please.
All that sugar's gonna mess up your liver.
I got to get my sugar from somewhere, especially with you being all boring.
I have a civpro exam this week.
So? Let me hook you up with last year's exam.
I'm not a cheater.
Right.
You're just a person who burns corpses and sticks them in dumpsters.
Maybe I'm just trying to do what you said... be a normal law student.
That way I can forget
Rebecca's nowhere to be found, and Nate's on trial for our murder.
That was bad advice.
You're not normal... not anymore, anyway.
Here she comes.
The arrest warrant, as promised.
Now, you owe me, butter, and don't think it's gonna be small.
When is it ever small with me?
Ugh.
Okay, who is this bitch?
We got to go.
Hmm.
Butter?
Yeah, that's not a story you'd be able to handle.
Oh, come on.
Stupid rich people.
Annalise, it's Bonnie.
Hang on.
What is it?
Frank got a copy of the
Hapstalls' arrest warrant.
The police found DNA in Helena's car.
It matches Caleb's.
Always bringing me problems, never solutions.
We can investigate the lab that did the DNA test.
And the chain of custody...
Or we can accept the fact that our clients are going down for three murders and cut our losses.
Yes. I say we stop hap-stallin' and hit eject on these fools.
Catherine's our way in.
She lied about being home with Caleb. We know that.
We just need her to open up.
I can talk to her.
You're too much alike.
She'll shut down.
I can still try.
I'll be the puppy.
It's what you say.
People trust me.
Oh, God, so we get into a Rebecca 2.0 situation?
Why don't you sit this one out, Romeo?
Wait, where is the Beckster these days?
You two still boinking?
It's a great idea, Wes.
- What?
- It is not.
It is!
And I better not see either of you in that courtroom again.
Annalise.
They need you back on the stand.
Just be yourself.
Oh. Uh...
Sorry.
Was Bonnie just in here?
No.
Who are you?
Uh, Wes. I work for Annalise.
I must just be early.
Do you... do you mind?
No.
So, how are you feeling?
Stressed, I bet.
Well, you shouldn't be.
Even though the DNA matches your brother,
Annalise will figure out a way to get it thrown out.
What do you mean the DNA matches him?
What DNA?
Uh, you know what?
- Bonnie will be here any minute. I...
- Tell me what you know.
I really shouldn't have said anything.
But you did, so tell me.
Did they find Caleb's DNA at the crime scene?
Oh, my God.
Does Caleb know?
I'm sure Bonnie's telling him right now.
It's fine.
You were with him that entire night.
Okay, no one's gonna believe that over DNA evidence.
They will if you're telling the truth.
What is that supposed to mean?
You're not lying, right?
You were with Caleb that entire night.
You were sent in here to play me.
Just tell me where he went,
Catherine.
Tell me so we can help you.
I was gone for a half an hour.
So you're admitting that you lied to us.
Only because I knew how it would look.
Or because you were slicing your aunt's throat.
No! God, no.
Then why do we have surveillance footage that puts you one block from your aunt's car?
That's impossible.
I run the same route every night...
River Road to the park and then back home.
That's nowhere near where they found her car, so if that's me on that tape...
Don't you get it now?
Someone's framing us.
Where'd you find that footage of Caleb?
I didn't.
You made it up?
It was a test. He passed.
Why did you and Mr. Keating argue the night he was killed?
I found out he was having an affair.
With Lila Stangard, who you just found out was pregnant by your husband?
- I assumed he was the father, yes.
- Did the argument get violent?
- Not on my end.
- Really?
Because your sister-in-law testified that you once threw a paperweight at...
Hearsay, Your Honor.
Not your purview, Ms. Keating, although I agree.
- Move on, Ms. Sinclair.
- So let me understand.
Here you are discovering that you're being traded in for a younger model.
Add that to your violent history...
- Argumentative.
- What did I just say?
Add that to your violent history as well as numerous indicators that proved you helped Mr. Lahey kill your husband...
I will not stand for this,
Your Honor.
You know, I have the utmost respect for your court, but not for these speculative, antagonizing questions.
As if I have any other choice.
The point of this hearing was to present evidence against Mr. Lahey... not me.
If that's not the case, then please charge me with my husband's murder, though I'm guessing that hasn't happened due to lack of evidence.
Instead, your strategy has been to attack me with accusations and insinuations making it very clear that this is not a preliminary hearing, but a witch-hunt.
And I did not put my hand on this court's Bible to be burnt at the stake, and especially by a petty, foolish, amateur prosecutor who doesn't deserve mine or anyone else in this court's respect!
That's quite a temper, Ms. Keating.
Seems like you're more than capable of murder.
Everyone up!
We have 36 more hours until the siblings' arraignment.
We're all going to stay up all night, if that's how long it takes to get the DNA evidence tossed.
Move!
Who wants coffee?
So it worked.
Playing the puppy.
It always works.
Hey, guys.
Hey! Oliver!
- What are you doing here?
- How's it going?
Oh, so many questions and from so many different people.
Oliver. Hey. Asher.
I'm sure the C-Dawg's told you all about me.
I'm his, uh, straight bro who's totally down with all your... gay stuff.
Right.
How you holding up, man?
Good?
- Asher...
- I just want to say... that I have all the respect in the world for what you're dealing with, and "Philadelphia's" one of my favorite movies, and I just...
I think you're really brave, man.
Like...
Oliver.
I hate you!
I know. I'm... I'm sorry.
Sorry doesn't explain why you tell strangers something I haven't even told my parents yet.
I'm just saying, it's not 1995.
You don't need to be ashamed.
Oh, apparently I do, according to your "bro" who thinks I'm dying.
- Asher's an idiot.
- No, you're the idiot because you told him.
It's hard to explain, but everyone in there... we know a lot about each other, even the really bad things.
Oh, like the fact that I'm positive?
No. I didn't...
That came out wrong.
Everything is coming out of your mouth wrong.
What's next?
You want to finally ask how I got it?
Because if I'm being really honest, you should be happy
I haven't told you.
That's how different we are.
I keep my mouth shut about things that'll hurt you.
What do you mean, hurt me?
It doesn't matter.
Just... Here you go.
Keys to our apartment.
But don't feel like you have to be in a rush to use them.
Ms. Keating, you admit to a violent altercation between Mr. Lahey and your husband on the night he was murdered, this after having your own heated argument with him that night, yet you claim you had absolutely nothing to do with his murder, which makes me wonder... who do you think killed your husband?
Ms. Keating?
The defendant.
I'm sorry.
Louder for the court, please.
I think Mr. Lahey killed my husband.
I won't do it.
Nate, please. The only way we explain your fingerprint on that ring is to admit to the fight with Sam.
There was no fight!
It was her idea.
So then think of it as my idea.
Who you representing here?
Her or me?
'Cause I'm more than happy to get on the stand and tell the judge the real story here.
Annalise framed me for this, and you're in on it.
I just didn't realize it till now, being a dumb ex-cop and all.
Nate, there's no other way.
There is.
Figure it out.
- He won't lie on the stand.
- Why not?
Oh, isn't this a coincidence?
Do you consider yourself a good liar, Ms. Keating?
Objection. Relevance.
- Sustained.
- Let me rephrase.
Did you lie when you said
- you think my client killed your husband?
- Of course not.
- So you think Mr. Lahey did it?
- Yes.
Because then you don't go away for this murder.
Your Honor, this line of questioning is completely...
No need to object, Ms. Sinclair.
In fact, maybe I should join you over here, since we agree on so much.
What do you think?
Shall we try this one together?
Make your point, Ms. Rothlo.
You killed your husband on your own, didn't you, Ms. Keating?
- No, I did not.
- You did.
Sam cheated on you with that girl, and it made you angry.
Angry, yes. A killer, no.
Or are you just that good of a liar?
You spend your whole life playing a part, after all... the perfect wife, dedicated attorney.
But you were faking it... faking a moral compass, faking being in love, when, really, deep down, you're out for yourself.
Which is why you had to kill Sam, because he had the nerve to shatter the sham that was your marriage!
Ms. Rothlo, watch the tone.
Do you think my client's a fool,
Ms. Keating?
- The only fool in here is you.
- Cute.
I only ask because isn't it true you only slept with him the night you murdered your husband to establish an alibi?
Then you ran home and played the grieving widow for the police, all while you had someone transfer my client's fingerprint to that ring.
Why aren't you defending yourself?!
Is it 'cause it's all true?
Shame on you, Ms. Keating.
Shame on you for using my client as a pawn in your own murder plot.
And shame on you for thinking we'd all be dumb enough to fall for it.
Shame on you.
She put it all on Annalise, even said she transferred
Nate's print to the ring.
You should be working on our case.
There's no way they can prove the print was transferred, right?
- Like I freaking know.
- Bonnie.
- I said go to work.
- It's about the case.
If Eve argued Nate's fingerprint was transferred, couldn't we do the same and say the police transferred Caleb's DNA to the crime scene?
Welcome to the Philly PD database.
- It's that easy to hack into?
- Yep.
I'm surprised my blabbermouth boyfriend hasn't told you already.
I am so sorry about that.
Asher's a jackass.
- That's what I said.
- Hey, buddy.
You're not allowed to talk right now.
Consider it practice for keeping your mouth shut.
Sorry about your fiancÃ©.
Oh, did Connor open up his big mouth about that, too?
Yep, said he was maybe bi or something.
- Let's not talk about it.
- No, let's.
Let's talk about how you have terrible taste in men.
I mean, like that guy at the courthouse today... how do you say no to that?
- Uh, he wasn't my type.
- What's your type?
Gay.
I'm with Oliver.
You don't get to talk anymore.
Well, speaking from experience,
I say go out on the date.
I mean, look at me.
I never thought I'd end up with a self-absorbed pretty boy.
- Oh, wow.
- What?
The police ran two DNA tests on the aunt's crime scene.
Why would they run two tests?
The cops deleted the first report because it didn't show anything at the scene.
But six hours later, they ran a new test, and that's when it matched to Caleb's DNA.
Because they planted it.
This is good.
You can use this at the arraignment.
So I can finish your job for you?
Just like Rebecca?
It's always gonna be like this with you, isn't it?
You stay the little girl lost while I play the mommy, always there to clean up your mess.
Do you want me to go?
Quit?
I will if that'll make you happier.
You see? Every decision rests on me.
Isn't that how you want it?
No! No!
I can't trust you to do anything yourself!
Because you don't let me!
You say you want me to be like you, but you don't.
Not really.
You want me like this so that I don't forget what I owe you.
Well, I...
I don't forget...
Annalise.
Ever.
And maybe you'll never believe me, but what I did...
Rebecca...
It was for you.
To take care of you...
The same way you took care of me.
I didn't take care of you.
I ruined you.
No.
You saved me.
No.
I didn't.
And the worst part is, is that you still think that I did.
No.
You needed to be saved from me.
And that's what you all need.
So maybe today was a good thing, you know?
Lock me up.
That way, you can all finally be safe.
Caleb and Catherine Hapstall, you've been charged with murder in the first degree in the death of Helena Hapstall.
Do you understand the charges?
They do not, Your Honor, and neither do I.
I have evidence that will show that these charges are without merit.
This is a simple arraignment,
Your Honor.
That we've come to based on a DNA match that was manufactured by the Philadelphia P.D.
Judge, please.
I have a report right here that shows Caleb Hapstall's DNA was on the victim's car.
Which is the second report you ran after you took a sample of my client's DNA and illegally placed it at the crime scene.
That's ludicrous, Your Honor.
Then why did your team delete the initial report?
No such thing happened, Your Honor.
I have evidence of both reports... the second manufactured lab results, as well as the initial report that was deleted.
So, Mr. Eastham, why did you delete the original tests, hmm?
I mean, unless you didn't want us to see it.
Explain that to the court.
That was awesome.
No, we were lucky.
We won by the skin of our teeth.
You lie to me again, and I'll fire both of you.
- Got it.
- Understood.
Now go home and don't kill anyone.
Good God, waitlist.
Just because there's no evidence that she killed the aunt doesn't make her dating material.
Annalise, Nate's judge made her decision.
All rise.
You may be seated.
We came to this hearing to decide whether there was enough evidence against Mr. Lahey to go to trial.
And yet much of the time was spent focused on the peccadilloes of Ms. Keating and whether she played the more substantial role.
It gives rise to the question...
Whose preliminary hearing was this?
Frankly, Ms. Sinclair, I don't think you know, either.
You yourself suggested that Ms. Keating, your own witness, was a liar.
As such, I have no option but to send you back to the drawing board.
Put together a new case... one where I can tell who the actual suspect is.
Mr. Lahey, you're free to go.
Thank you.
Here's what's fair.
I hurt you and I hate myself for that, and the only way I see us getting past this is if you hurt me back.
Like punch you or something?
Tell me how you got it.
It doesn't matter.
It's what I deserve, Oliver, like you said.
Do it.
Hurt me.
I can take it.
I was a mess after you cheated on me.
Like, I didn't get out of bed for a week.
I just kept googling that guy you hooked up with and staring at his abs.
My friends forced me to go out.
"Get laid," they said.
"Rebound the pain away!"
So I went to this bar, did shots... many, many shots.
And I ended up going home with some guy.
I barely remember anything.
Like, if I saw him on the street,
I wouldn't even recognize him.
So...
Yeah, that's the long, sad, clichÃ© story of how I got it.
Because I cheated on you.
No. Not really.
It was my bad decision.
Yeah, that you made because of me.
It's my fault.
You didn't have to come.
Of course I did.
You're forgiven.
Annalise, please.
That D.A. doesn't have enough evidence to charge you.
I know.
Okay, this is still how you do things.
- How do I do things?
- You avoid anything hard.
You did it when you left me for Sam, refused to see me.
You can't avoid this conversation by, what...
- pretending you're hungry?
- What do you mean? I forgave you.
You don't mean it.
Well, if you don't believe me...
Of course I don't believe you.
What I did to you, you get to be angry with me.
I'm done being angry with people.
With people, yes.
But this is me.
What do you mean?
We don't know each other anymore.
I don't agree with that.
Especially after the other night.
It was sex. Get over it.
Okay.
No more running, Annalise.
This conversation is happening now...
Why did you have to do that?
You needed to pin it on me,
I know that.
But you didn't have to make it about me... Me.
The things you knew would hurt me.
You made it personal, and I don't understand why you had to do that, unless that was the point... to hurt me.
Why would you do that?
You know why.
I don't.
Because part of me's still in love with you.
It's pathetic, I know.
I mean, we were forever ago, but...
I guess I'm just stuck.
Yes, I've been with plenty of other women, buried myself in work, but...
You show up again in my life, Annalise, and I'm just done.
You still have me, and I hate it.
I don't hate you, but I...
I hate how you make me feel.
Because I can't have you.
I'm sorry.
That's all I came here to say.
I'm sorry.
Look at me.
- No.
- Look at me.
- Annalise, don't do this.
- Look at me.
It was good with you.
And real.
Too real.
So I got scared.
And I left.
But you're the most beautiful thing that ever happened to me.
What do you want?
Guess who got an "A" on her civpro exam?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, and with no cheating, which proves I can be normal.
You couldn't have just texted me that?
Fine.
I'll go.
Really?
Without getting what you came for?
That is not why I came here.
Yeah, it is.
For the fast, hard, make-your-toes-curl sex those prep-school boys never gave you.
You think so highly of yourself.
No.
I can just read your body.
Those goose bumps on your neck, how fast your heart's pounding, and now you want me to kiss you... slow, deep, my tongue moving down your neck, chest, stomach, all the way till I'm under that skirt.
My fingers sliding inside your panties.
Too bad that's not happening tonight.
You're disappointed,
I know, but...
Think about how disappointing it is to be treated like a gigolo.
If you're interested in me, get to know me.
Otherwise,
this is closed for business.
âª An observer at that âª
âª and if you're wary, don't believe me at that âª
âª When I say that I wouldn't,
I wouldn't dare âª
âª from the tip of your tongue âª
âª mercy awaits and cuts like a knife âª
âª bound to the badlands âª
âª heaven's distraction âª
âª there's no persuasion stronger than sorrow âª
âª it's stronger than âª
You don't know who you're dealing with here.
I'm nice with it on a pool table.
And you're just trying to get me drunk so you can beat me.
Not gonna happen.
âª Learning to trust my hand to you âª
Let's do this.
âª My hand to you âª
Bye, Felicia.
That's another way to say "suck it" because my team threw up a "W" in court today and handed you yo' ass, which means now there's no need for me play the mole anymo'.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I'm saying screw you for putting me in this position.
I almost considered leaving my lady because of this crap.
But now I don't have to.
In fact, I'm on my way to make sweet love with her all... night... long.
You should do that.
Oh, I will.
And then you can give her the bad news.
I'm the new prosecutor on the Hapstall case.
âª
- Come with me.
- To New York?
Well, not this second, but why not eventually?
You can't stay in this house...
Sam's house.
And what else is keeping you here?
I mean, that tabloid case is beneath you, and if it's teaching,
I'll call Columbia.
I'm not saying marry me.
Just... just think about it, is all.
I'll think about it.
She's dying. She's dying.
She's... she's dying.
Connor, there is nothing we can do for her.
- No.
- The police are gonna be here any second.
- I don't care!
- Damn it, Connor.
It's the only way we end up okay... if we leave right now.
Please, Connor.
Please. Please.
Please.
Emily Sinclair.
Have you seen this woman before?
I'm the new prosecutor on the Hapstall case. http://www.TeslaVid.eu - Watch TV-series online

## S02E3

ANNALISE: Previously on
How to Get Away With Murder...
Levi.
LEVI: You don't know who you're dealing with here.
That's the long, sad, cliche story of how I got it.
It's my fault.
If you're interested in me, get to know me.
Otherwise, this is closed for business.
WOMAN: Today's the preliminary hearing
for Caleb and
Catherine Hapstall,
accused of murdering their parents.
We have to establish an alibi in order to get the charges thrown out.
An alibi for the night that their parents were killed or their aunt?
I have evidence that will show that these charges are without merit.
That was awesome.
You lie to me again, and I'll fire both of you.
Screw you for putting me in this position.
I'm the new prosecutor on the Hapstall case.
JUDGE: Mr. Lahey, you're free to go.
EVE: Come with me.
To New York?
(EVE CHUCKLING) I'm
not saying marry me.
Just think about it.
CONNOR: She's dying.
It's the only way we end up okay, if we leave right now.
(GASPING)
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
(GASPING)
(VIBRATING CONTINUES)
Come on, answer the phone, damn it.
(GASPING)
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
This is Annalise Keating.
If it's urgent, call my office
at 215-555-0122. (BEEP)
Hey, it's me.
Call and tell me you're okay, please.
(GASPING)
ANNALISE: Why'd they do it?
Most parricides are the result of years of abuse, but Catherine and Caleb say they had a happy childhood, so why kill their parents?
What's the motive?
The prosecution will argue that it's the billion-dollar inheritance.
And then there's the outsider theory.
They felt so unloved and resentful that they...
Tied up, tortured...
And shot their parents execution-style.
Ugh.
Bonnie, test psychological defenses based on adopted-child syndrome, oppositional defiant disorder, selective mutism, primal wound theory.
Ugh, get me some chocolate-chip cookies.
I hate all this healthy food.
(COMPUTER CHIMES)
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
(SIGHS)
Frank, get me that update on Nate.
If I have to ask you again, you're fired.
(LIQUID POURS)
Let's focus-group the siblings, see how a mock jury responds.
If they like 'em, hate 'em, think they're strange,
because motive is everything in this case.
If the prosecution
invents a good one,
we're screwed.
Hell, we're already screwed.
(SNORING)
(THUDDING)
(THUDDING)
(BREATHING SHAKILY)
I got a gun, and I called the police!
(CLATTERING)
(CLATTERING)
(GASPING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Thank you for coming.
Frank wasn't picking up his phone.
Where is it?
(SIGHS)
Here.
(SCRAPING)
What are you doing?
It's suffering.
You probably shouldn't look.
(RAT SQUEAKING)
Now you're worried
I'm gonna be calling you every night.
The crazy old kook who's afraid to be in the house alone.
(CHUCKLES) Don't worry.
I wasn't asleep.
Is it Rebecca?
You miss her?
No, no, that's...
It's okay if you do.
And you?
Do you miss...
Sam? God, no.
No.
And I don't want you to ever worry about that. Promise me.
Okay, but...
I was actually gonna say Nate.
You should go home, get some sleep before class.
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
ANNALISE: "Sex."
I know what you're thinking.
"I paid 80 grand a year for this?
"What does sex have to do with criminal law?"
Everything.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(MOANS)
Get out.
What?
Oh, God.
Look, honey, I want this.
Oh, God, I want this.
But I am not a third-date kind of girl, so...
Leave.
But I thought...
Mmm, right now.
Okay.
I'll go.
(SIGHS)
Last chance.
Oh! Go!
(SCOFFS)
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)
(GROANS)
ANNALISE: Sex, after all, drives most criminal behavior.
For instance, a husband discovering his wife had an affair is one of the leading causes of murder.
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)
I hate you!
(DOOR OPENS)
BONNIE: Asher?
Hey. Sexy lady.
You're late.
Yeah, sorry.
My con-law brief took forever, but I'm here now.
And I thought maybe we could take a trip to the zoo.
The zoo?
Yeah, so I could show you my...
Elephant trunk.
(TRUMPETS)
Come here, Dumbo.
ANNALISE: We call these crimes of passion, and the heat-of-passion defense is your most valuable tool when representing a client you know is guilty.
OLIVER: So, is this like a "mea culpa" breakfast?
'Cause I'll say it over and over until you finally hear me.
You didn't give me HIV.
This isn't an apology breakfast.
This is a celebration breakfast
'cause today marks day 20 of operation prep, which means only one more day...
Until D-day.
(MICROWAVE BEEPS)
The "D" stands for...
I know what the "D" stands for.
Yeah.
But what if there's a "cooling of the blood" period?
Ms. Cohen.
You can't use a heat-of-passion defense.
The client would've had enough time to contemplate their action.
FRANK: You still mad at me?
Why would I be mad at you?
For leaving you with blue balls the other night.
But don't worry,
I'm sure you'll get back in my pants eventually.
(SIGHS) Actually,
I think we should end this.
Really?
Mmm.
Not even gonna try to get to know me?
I do know you.
No, you don't.
I think you're just afraid to get to know the real me
'cause you know you'll fall for him.
And good luck if the prosecution's painting your client as being a sexual deviant.
Juries are way more likely to hand down a guilty verdict if they think your client is a pervert.
How's the suit?
I bought it three sizes too large so no one would think I had boobs.
Hell, I'm not even sure they're in there.
You look good, but you have to relax.
Juries see nerves as a sign of guilt.
Deep breaths so I don't look like a killer. Got it.
Damn.
She's got to be the most smoking client we've ever had.
That's just because you know what she does for a living.
LAUREL: She's not a prostitute.
MICHAELA: You really think there's a difference?
Yes, the only reason why they're charging her is because she owns her sexuality.
Or because she killed the guy.
He had a heart attack during sex.
Yeah, rough sex.
She screwed him too hard.
That's involuntary manslaughter.
That's how I want to go out, yo.
Laying underneath a hot woman, my Johnson all snug as a bug in a rug.
BAILIFF: All rise!
How'd you first meet the defendant, Mr. Holt?
I'm a loan officer at True Heritage Bank.
Tanya came to me with a business proposal.
An indecent proposal.
And what was the nature of this business?
She wanted to open up a holistic center where her clients could have privacy during their healing.
Oh, sexual healing.
And when did you learn that the center would actually just be a home for sex parties?
Objection. Prosecution is leading the witness.
Watch yourself, Mr. Morris.
My apologies, Your Honor.
Mr. Holt, isn't it true your exchange with the defendant went beyond the bank?
Yes, I had a private meeting with Tanya at Utopia Circle.
You slept with him?
(AUDIENCE MURMURING)
Look at him.
MORRIS: How would you describe your experience?
Traumatizing.
The sex started out pleasant enough, but then things escalated and it got rough.
And now the fun begins.
How so?
She held me down and even choked me at one point.
He asked for that.
So, Ms. Randolph put her own sexual desires before your safety.
Objection, counsel is testifying.
Just like she did with Dominic Ewing...
Sustained.
Thereby killing him, leaving his wife a widow and his children fatherless!
ANNALISE: Motion to strike, Your Honor.
JUDGE: That's it, Mr. Morris!
Strike the prosecutor's last statements from the record.
Jury, please disregard everything that was stated after I sustained
Ms. Keating's objection.
That bastard's lying.
He's just ashamed to admit he's a submissive.
Which makes you the dominant.
That's all the jury heard in there.
Then put me on the stand.
I'll make it very clear
I did not murder anyone with my vagina.
I have a good solution.
Give me the list.
No. Utopia Circle's anonymous.
I can't win this unless I have the names of every guest at the party the night Dominic died.
I'll lose all my clients.
You want to keep your business, or do you want to go to jail for being a negligent slut?
Excuse me?
It's not me who thinks this.
It's the entire jury in there.
So...
Seems like an easy decision to me.
(SIGHS)
ANNALISE: Tanya's confidential guest ledger.
Talk to everyone who went to that party, get them to testify that
Tanya and Dominic's sex was routine and not rough.
What do we win if we do a good job?
My respect.
Move. Find me a pervert.
SARAH: You cannot be here.
I teach children.
Do you think there is any way
I would be able to keep my job if people knew I had spent my entire weekend at Tantric sex parties?
Your entire weekend?
It's called Utopia
Circle for a reason.
Well, then help Tanya keep it open.
If you testify...
Kevin, that is not something we put in our mouth.
RENEE: It's big.
"It" being...
Sex-party scene in Philly.
Oh.
(CHUCKLES) Good, I thought you were talking about...
My member?
Yeah, that, too.
CONNOR: You have nothing to be embarrassed about.
Oh, I'm not embarrassed.
I love sex, especially with guys who look like you, but...
DAVID: How dare you?
This is a complete violation of the anonymity we were promised at Utopia Circle.
Utopia Circle won't exist if Tanya's convicted.
Maybe she should be convicted.
I mean, Dominic's dead because she pushed him too far.
It's called "The octopus."
Dominic's favorite position. Mine, too, except Dominic also liked to get slapped in the face during it.
Uh, how does this help
Tanya's case?
It doesn't.
I was just gonna say only Tanya was willing to smack him like that.
Okay, like, one time, she took her fist and...
RENEE: Put my ass on the stand?
No way.
Okay, but if you testify, people would know about your...
Your gift.
You could be famous.
As a whore, freak, nympho, and whatever other derogatory terms the world throws at you when you're sex-positive.
Do I wish that I were strong enough to take the stand and talk about the eight-hour orgasm
I once had at Tanya's house?
Eight hours?
Oh yeah. You can...
Come if you're at all interested.
It's tonight.
Small party until
Tanya's back in business.
Uh, thanks, but
I'm gay. (CHUCKLES)
Even better.
You're just my husband's type.
What about your wife?
What about her?
She was at the party that night, too.
See, you're not supposed to know that.
Now leave.
But if we can't find anyone in...
We're not testifying.
No.
Never.
Hells no.
I'd rather go to jail.
ANNALISE: You couldn't
find one witness to
take the stand?
CONNOR: Some of them believe Tanya's innocent, but they're too afraid of being outed.
They would do anything for love, but they won't do that.
Maybe we could subpoena them, force them to testify?
So they can hate us and sabotage the case on the stand?
Annalise.
I mean, what is it about you people?
The more experience you get, the worse you get at this job.
Annalise.
What?
Look.
ANNALISE: Where are they?
I'll tell you if you just give me a chance to.
I don't have time for that.
Wait here, or I'll have to call security.
It's all right, Sandra.
CALEB: What's going on?
Why don't you two tell me?
So, tell us, are you two lovers?
This was the morning our parents were killed.
I was comforting her.
With a kiss?
That's not how I comfort my siblings.
(ASHER CHUCKLES)
CATHERINE: Why are they here?
Oh, them?
Those are the strangers judging you as sick, incestuous freaks.
Okay, we didn't...
She's putting words in our mouths.
Get used to it because that's all the jury pool knows about you now, that you two are screwing and that's why you killed your parents, because they found out and threatened to cut you out of the will.
We would never.
That is not true.
How do I know you're not lying to me again?
Love is love, after all.
Who am I to judge?
How dare you?
You begged us to hire you, said you'd protect us from all the crap everyone is saying.
So, either you trust us when we tell you the truth, or we'll find a new lawyer who can.
I can't be the only one that noticed the heat coming off those two.
They're totes smushing.
At least they're not related-related.
Mmm, legally, they're related.
Well, if you're gonna incest your brother, might as well look like Caleb.
I know. Those eyes, right?
Well, Catherine's hot, too.
Well, helps she's great in bed.
(SIGHS)
I'm allowed to make jokes, too.
Look, if you're gonna sleep with another client, make it Tanya. Apparently, orgasms for days.
ASHER: Okay, that's not actually possible, right?
You can't like...
More than once or twice, right?
Uh, speak for yourself.
Be honest.
Frank, is he your best?
My best was Matt Harris, my physics tutor.
We used to...
Reminder, straight guys over here.
Wait list, let me guess... Rebecca.
Can we stop this conversation?
Why?
Are you upset that you spent all of those years of bad sex with Aiden?
I'm just saying not everyone wants to discuss the number of orgasms they've had in their life.
You mean in a row.
Yeah, I mean, who remembers the number of orgasms they've had in their life?
I don't know, maybe someone who hasn't had many.
Yeah, or any.
(GIGGLING)
Michaela.
Never?
Not even when Aiden went...
He didn't do that! And...
Okay, I know I should've known he was gay a long time ago.
And it's not that weird.
Planned Parenthood says that one in three women have difficulty achieving orgasm, and it's mostly due to society sex-shaming us.
So, maybe stop doing that to me.
What are they doing?
Figuring out how to discredit the loan officer?
Proving Dominic had a heart condition?
Just don't say gabbing about your pathetic sex lives.
Actually, uh, uh, Michaela and I have a lead on a witness angle.
Oh.
Finally, someone doing their job.
MICHAELA: You know I'll tell
Oliver if you do anything.
Exactly. That's why you're here, to make sure that I stay soft.
Besides, this is the perfect place for you to learn how to hit your G-spot.
Oh, God.
ALICIA: Connor.
You made it.
This is my husband, Ajay.
We're a match.
Two snakes.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
You think Sinclair planted that?
I know she did.
Find out who got it to her in the first place.
I'm on it.
Are you forgetting something?
Nate.
I asked you about an update on my recorder.
Oh, it wasn't on your desk this morning.
There's not much to tell.
He pretty much goes to see the wife at the hospital and spends the rest of his time at home.
What about his job?
Not gonna happen.
PD doesn't want him anywhere near them.
(SIGHS)
Hey.
You're doing everything you can to make it right for the guy.
Because I did all the wrong.
And he should get over that.
Really? That's your dating advice?
Leave me alone.
ANNALISE: Tanya's confidential guest ledger.
MATTHEW: This is impossible.
Yet there's your daughter's name, as plain as day.
You expect me to believe that my daughter's one of these sickos?
It's not what you believe, Sergeant.
It's what your future son-in-law believes once her name surfaces in connection to a death in a dirty sex house.
What do you want?
A job.
Uh, we should be leaving.
No.
Stay.
Okay.
But only if you agree to testify for Tanya.
No.
(SIGHS)
I already told him that.
An innocent woman might go to jail.
Maybe she deserves it.
Ajay.
No, what does that mean?
ALICIA: It doesn't matter.
He wasn't there that night.
No, but you told me
Tanya switched cards with you.
Is that true? Alicia.
ANNALISE:
It wasn't an accident.
TANYA: Of course it was.
No.
You traded cards so you could have sex with Dominic that night.
Why? So you could kill him.
That's ridiculous.
You think the prosecution doesn't have evidence against you?
Neither did I until now.
So, maybe I can just take this info to them, see what they think of it.
Please don't.
Why'd you do it?
Because I loved him.
I'm not a relationship person.
That's what I told myself my whole life.
That's why I opened Utopia Circle.
But then I fell in love with Dominic.
He told me he felt the same, but there was his wife.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Switch cards with me.
TANYA: I begged him to leave Cynthia, but he said he couldn't do that.
He said he had a family and he couldn't hurt them that way.
Fate has brought us together again.
Are you sure?
There's plenty of other men here that want you.
And I want you.
For old time's sake.
And I brought you a treat.
Oh.
Ah.
(SIGHS)
Nitroglycerine.
If you take it with Viagra, it can cause a heart attack.
(GASPING)
Dominic.
(BREATHING SHAKILY)
Somebody call 911!
Hurry!
I never wanted him to die.
(CRYING) I promise.
I only wanted Cynthia to find out who he really was.
So she could leave him and you two could end up happily ever after.
We had something rare.
Maybe you don't believe that, but I loved him more than anything.
No, you love yourself more than anything.
You know, you brag about being free and modern, but you're really just selfish.
Alone and sad and too weak to put up with it like the rest of us do.
And the worst part is you give those of us who really like sex a bad name.
Get out.
But this was...
I said go!
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)
(SIGHS) We're good.
He's gonna find out who gave Sinclair the photo.
Who's he?
Does it matter?
(SCOFFS)
What?
Nothing. Just...
Thought you brought me here so that I could
(MOCKINGLY)
"Get to know you better."
Fine. (SIGHS)
What do you want to know?
What does your mom do?
Homemaker.
And if I ever mess up and say housewife, she slaps me.
(LAUGHS) Your father?
Consigliere to Donnie d'Elia.
No, I'm kidding.
He's a mechanic.
We play poker every Sunday.
What's next?
You want to know about my childhood?
It was awesome.
I was good at sports,
I got laid whenever I wanted, my parents loved me.
After high school,
I went to community college, but got kicked out for cheating...
Why are you speeding through this?
I'm interested.
No.
You're just interested in knowing the good things.
That's not true.
You know things about me that aren't good, so, good things, bad...
Just talk to me.
What if it's mostly bad things?
Like what?
We should get back to the house.
(ENGINE TURNS OVER)
SINCLAIR: Relax.
No one's gonna see us.
I'm just here to return this.
I got a gun!
(CLATTERING)
Proved more useful than I thought.
Oh, my God.
You leaked that creepy incest pic.
What's the motive?
It feels good, doesn't it, being on the right side of justice for once?
Justice? Is that why you're gunning for Annalise?
'Cause, uh, it's really pretty stalker-y how much you care about taking her down, to be honest.
Hmm.
Just text me when you know what she's gonna do with the picture.
No, I'm done.
Excuse me?
Look, I stole your little recorder thingy, and I almost got killed doing it.
Trotter Lake, Asher.
Shut up with that!
Look, if you want to make a threat real, you go for it.
But I am done being anyone's mole.
This woman lost her husband, the father of her two boys, and they deserve justice, no matter what the defense says today.
Tanya Randolph committed involuntary manslaughter when...
So, what's the plan here, unless you just want me to lose?
I never lose.
JUDGE: Is the defense ready with your case-in-chief?
We are.
But before we call our first witness, there's something
I need to share with the court.
The prosecution is right.
Dominic Ewing's death was not an accident.
However, they're wrong about the charges being brought before the court.
This is not involuntary manslaughter, but intentional, premeditated first-degree murder.
(SPECTATORS MURMURING)
I have physical proof that Dominic Ewing was murdered.
As such, it's my ethical duty to reveal that evidence to the state.
This is a stunt, Your Honor.
She's upping her client's charges.
Who says I'm upping my client's charges?
Mrs. Ewing, when was the last time you and your husband had sex?
Objection, relevance?
Since when is the victim's sex life not relevant in this case?
Overruled.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Um... Over a year ago.
Things cooled off after we had kids.
Your Honor, I'd like to enter into evidence a full-panel toxicology report on Dominic's blood sample taken by the lab this morning.
We've already discussed the original tox report in detail.
This is a new report my team ran when we came upon new evidence.
Very well. Proceed.
Mrs. Ewing, can you read the first drug that was found in your husband's system?
Viagra.
Were you always aware that your husband was taking Viagra?
No.
Not until I went to the pharmacy to pick up medication for my son and they asked if I wanted Dominic's, too.
I imagine, if I were in your shoes, that news would hurt me quite a lot.
To say the least.
I understand.
Can you read the second drug that the lab found in your husband's system?
Nitroglycerine.
This is wrong.
You have to stop her.
Nobody stops her.
Blood-pressure medication that your husband was not on, but when taken with Viagra, nitroglycerine can cause a fatal coronary.
But you already knew that, didn't you, Mrs. Ewing?
Of course not.
Really?
Because the warning is on the prescription pill bottle that you just testified to picking up.
But are you suggesting
I killed my husband?
No, I know you killed him.
Objection, speculation.
You were upset that he was having sex with strangers, so you got revenge the only way you knew how.
Objection, Your Honor.
Mrs. Ewing wasn't near the party the night Dominic died.
But she knew where he was headed, and after he took the Viagra, you slipped him the nitrate pill, knowing that it would kill him.
Tell the truth, Cynthia.
Your Honor.
You were angry at your cheating husband, so you killed him and framed it on my client.
That's the truth, isn't it?
You did it.
You're the real killer in this courtroom.
(SOBBING)
JUDGE: Has the jury reached a unanimous verdict?
FOREPERSON:
We have, Your Honor.
In the case of
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Randolph,
on the count of involuntary manslaughter,
the jury finds the defendant not guilty.
(COUGHS)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
ANNALISE:
Feel better?
You shouldn't have done that.
And you shouldn't have killed your boyfriend.
Relax.
The DA's not gonna charge the wife.
You destroyed her in front of her children.
I did my job.
You should be thinking about what present you're gonna get me as a thank you.
How do you sleep at night?
Alone.
On very comfortable sheets.
I like expensive bottles of vodka.
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
She's pretty.
It's her, right?
Who you've been seeing?
No... I...
You show up late for dates.
You're constantly on your phone.
I met her in the library.
I was making copies, the printer jammed, she was helping me un-jam it, and we...
Started talking.
Look, I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
It's probably better, considering we work together.
It's not you, Bon.
You're great. I swear...
Don't do that.
Really, I'll be fine.
Look what I found on the porch.
Knock yourselves out.
"Don't let my mistakes ruin sex for you. Tanya."
Okay, she's just creepy.
Yep. So is this.
ASHER: Wow.
Maybe little missy could use it to have her first big "O."
Oh!
(LAUGHING)
No one is allowed to talk about my sex life ever again.
ASHER: Aah!
You know, something tells me that this stud is gonna know exactly how to make it rain.
Who's that?
CONNOR: That is Levi,
Michaela's new boyfriend.
Oh.
Mmm.
Michaela.
CONNOR: See, look.
He's even got wait list sweating.
MICHAELA: Oh, God, what time is it?
8:00.
Oh, crap! Oh!
He's coming over in a half-hour and I said I'd cook, but I have no food!
(ASHER CHUCKLES)
Get it in, girl!
(GRUNTS)
Hey, Wes.
You're "Eggs."
(STRAINED) No.
Don't lie.
Rebecca's Eggs.
She knocked over a carton once.
Our foster dad made her lick 'em off the floor.
I called her Eggs after that.
You're her foster brother?
Yeah. You mind letting go?
I kind of can't breathe.
What do you want?
The same as you...
To find Rebecca.
You haven't heard from her?
No.
I think she's dead.
You don't know that.
We talked the day before
I got the 911 text.
She said things were bad.
She didn't tell me why, but if I didn't hear from her, it would be her lawyer.
Nobody wanted to hurt her.
You expect me to believe that?
It could be you, for all I know.
No. I...
You loved her.
I know.
So, either she was wrong about you...
Or it's that lady you work for.
We know where Rebecca is.
But you're afraid I'm gonna try and find her.
Do you want to find her?
It's time to move on.
Stay away from Michaela, or I tell her who you are.
You're not gonna tell her anyway?
No.
And why the hell not?
Because I want to know the truth...
Just like you.
Deal?
Deal.
I made you promise not to see Frank, and then I go and hook up with doucheface?
And the worst part.
I fell for that putz.
And don't you dare tell anyone this, but the sex...
(SINGSONG VOICE)
It was good.
(LAUGHS)
Maybe we should talk about something else.
Oh, like you're such a prude?
Hey, I know what Frank's into, so if he's into you, that says a lot about you, little missy.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Finally.
Wait.
So, you and Frank, he tells you things?
What do you mean, "things"?
I don't know.
It's just he's always hinting at all this bad stuff he does, and I don't know if that's just a front or...
Mmm, you minx.
You invited me out for drinks so you could pump me for info about Frank.
No.
Men lie to us, Laurel.
We don't need to do it to each other.
Fine.
(SIGHS)
I like him.
And I want to know more about him.
Why is that so bad?
You do like him.
That's too bad.
Me and Frank, we got a fight club.
And the first rule is we don't tell you knuckleheads crap about each other.
Hey, lazy, another round on her.
(SIGHS)
Found your recorder.
It's on the floor next to Bonnie's desk.
(SIGHS) Thank you.
So, I talked to my guy about who sent the photo to Sinclair.
He give you a name?
No, but he tracked the IP address to an apartment building in south Philly.
Guess who happens to live there.
I'm just glad the world finally knows the truth.
It was time.
(CLEARING THROAT)
BONNIE: Ms. Guthrie.
Wait here, or I'll have to call security.
You were their employee.
They trusted you with their privacy.
Something that perverse should never be private.
How do you know it's true?
I've known Caleb and Catherine their entire lives.
You notice things, especially when they're not right.
So, when I found
Grant and Ursula that morning...
(VOICE BREAKING)
Saw the things that had been done to them...
They're guilty,
Ms. Keating.
ANNALISE:
So, we have a motive.
Parents find out about incest, take them out of will.
Bye-bye billions.
So, the strategy is to...
I don't know what the damn strategy is.
(SIGHS) Slobs.
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
It's a miracle we made it 21 days.
I can't wait any longer.
On your stomach.
I'll get the lube.
Wait.
I, uh, I have to tell you something.
Okay, you're scaring me.
It's... It's...
It's nothing bad. I just...
I met this girl through work who invited me to a sex party, so I went.
(SCOFFS)
How is that not bad?
Just listen.
Why? So I can hear your lame excuses?
I didn't hook up with anyone, Ollie.
I didn't even want to.
You can ask Michaela.
She was there.
She'll tell you that I was good.
For once, I...
(CHUCKLES) I was good.
(LAUGHS)
What?
I, uh... I mean, even I probably would've had sex at a sex party.
Right.
So, we're okay?
Yeah.
You've changed.
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah, 'cause of...
'Cause of you.
You know what?
Lie on your back.
Why?
I want to look in your eyes.
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
So... I changed my mind.
I want you to sleep over.
To sleep...
Or do other things?
Other things.
Mmm. (GASPS)
Got any ideas?
Mmm. I can think of...
Mmm.
(CHUCKLES)
Spell it.

Did your mother put you up to this?
She doesn't know I'm here.
Dad, I'm in trouble.
What's wrong, Ash?
It's about Tiffany.
Hi.
Is this so you could get a thank you?
Like there's any other reason the sergeant's offering me a job.
What do you want?
A job.
I know it doesn't make up for everything, but...
I ain't taking the job.
Not if it means owing you anything.
You don't. At all.
I... Just wanted to do what was right.
Is that why you screwed Eve, too, to do what's right?
She was just someone from my past.
Right.
Just like Sam, me, and the next person you decide to use.
You're right, okay?
Everything you want to say to me right now, all the names you want to call me, pathetic, conniving, selfish, but...
(SIGHS)
I had to try, Nate.
Not so you'd forgive me, but because...
I miss you.
And, uh...
I understand if we can't get past this, but I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if I didn't at least try.
You need to go home.
Okay.
I'm not saying no, Annalise.
Just...
I need more time.
All right.
Good night.
Night.
(SIGHS)
I'm in.

Hello?
Nate?
WOMAN: No. Is this Annalise?
Who is this?
Nia Lahey.
Nate's wife.
He already left for work.
Sit.
I was afraid to come.
I'm not a woman who gets afraid.
I know.
I'd be scared, too.
I've thought about you a lot.
I've thought,
"What kind of woman
"could be with a man when his wife is dying?"
That's not a judgment.
I admire your strength.
Do you love him?
I don't know how to answer that.
Then say, "Yes."
I need you to love him, Annalise.
They keep pumping me full of drugs and radiation, signing me up for trials.
The miracle of modern medicine can keep me alive for years, but this is not living.
I mean, not for me.
Definitely not for Nate.
I want you to do a favor for me, Annalise.
I want you to help me end it.
I'm sorry?
I want you to kill me.
NIA: (ECHOING)
Is this Annalise?
I want you to do a favor for me.
Do you love him?
ANNALISE: I'm sorry?
NIA: I want you to kill me.
BONNIE: Annalise.
There you are.
ZOE: Rachel was my best friend.
We had this plan that we were gonna go to college together, be bridesmaids at each other's weddings.
Rachel's dad and I used to joke that maybe they'd marry each other.
Tom.
I just want them to know the real Zoe, that what happened isn't her...
We know it's hard, Mr. Mitchell, but we may need Zoe to do this in court, too, so...
Go on. You're doing good.
Last year, when we started school,
Rachel and I started hanging out with Molly and Megan.
And it was fun at first.
They were really popular, and we liked that they noticed us.
But then Rachel started talking to Molly's boyfriend.
And Molly said it first, she said that we had to teach Rachel a lesson.
And I thought that she was just joking, that we were gonna, you know, like, take her into the woods and scare her, but...
I should have stopped them.
And I know that.
But I was scared.
But...
They made me do it.
(SNIFFLING)
They made me kill my best friend.
Any of us are capable of what Zoe did.
We'd like to think that we have self-control and free will.
But under the right circumstances, any of us can become a killer.
The prosecution wants you to believe that Molly Bartlett and Megan Harris were brainwashed by my client.
The DA even made a plea deal with them so they'd testify against Zoe.
But the truth is,
Megan and Molly are the ones responsible here.
They used their social clout to recruit Zoe, an impressionable girl, into their very own murder club.
Doesn't this all sound familiar?
KAPLAN: Zoe Mitchell is not a victim here.
She's the ringleader, orchestrating the cold-blooded murder of Rachel Glasser.
It was Zoe who wanted this girl dead.
Zoe... was roped into a sick revenge plot over a boy.
And in that moment, she lost herself, forgot who she was.
And then... bullied Molly and Megan into luring Rachel into the woods behind their school to kill her.
Together, they stabbed her not once, not twice, but 52 times.
Zoe wishes she could take it all back, return to the days when it was just her and her best friend, Rachel.
Before she met the bad influences who'd ruin her life.
KAPLAN: What kind of person kills their best friend?
A sociopath, that's who, because that's what
Zoe Mitchell is, a conniving, remorseless... innocent girl who doesn't deserve jail.
Instead, she needs to be placed in a psychiatric facility where she can get the help that she needs.
So please consider this fragile, susceptible teenager and remember...
She could be your child, too.
MICHAELA: Well,
I guess they look normal.
LAUREL:
Just because they're smiling doesn't mean they don't want to kill each other.
Hmm, said the girl who clearly wasn't popular in high school.
Who says I wasn't?
(SCOFFS)
Please.
CONNOR: Can we stop "Mean girling," and talk about how
Annalise's opening was literally a step-by-step of what she did to us?
All she did was protect us when she didn't need to.
She did need to, to protect herself.
You're an ingrate.
No, wait, okay.
Let's hear your case.
Okay, fine.
She uses bullying and public humiliation in class, one.
Two, she keeps us trapped in her world so the only thing that we care about are her needs.
Three, we work for her day and night so we never get to sleep.
Four, she creates this cult of superiority, the...
The K5, which makes us feel special just to be around her, which pits us against each other.
(STAMMERING) It's brainwashing 101.
Then quit.
He can't.
It's like the mob, they kill you if you try to leave.
Yeah, exactly and she'd probably have her little puppy do it.
The prosecution shrink, Dr. Healy, is gonna take the stand later today, and he's gonna make Zoe out to be the ringleader.
So I need you to go through all of his old case files, find screw-ups with past patients.
I need something by 3:00.
That's in two hours.
So? You have something better to do?
No, but there's just four of us, since
Asher didn't show...
Actually, now three.
Miss Pratt, I have a special assignment for you.
Does anyone feel jealous and suddenly motivated?
ANNALISE: You're gonna
prep Catherine and Caleb
to take the stand.
Oh, really?
I didn't even know you wanted them to testify.
I don't, but I need to know if they're screwing, so see if you can get one of them to admit it.
Uh, you mean trick them?
Is that a problem?
No, just, why me?
Normally, it would be Bonnie or Wes you would send...
Should it be Bonnie?
No, no, no.
I'll go right now.
You're smart, Michaela.
That's why.
Thank...
And you've got boobs.
A brother not screwing his sister should respond to them.
BONNIE: Where are you?
(ASHER COUGHING OVER PHONE)
ASHER OVER PHONE: Sick.
I got hit with this fricking ninja virus.
Are you avoiding me?
Because I'm a big girl, and I can handle being dumped.
No. No, I just, I don't want to get anyone else sick.
Fine. Just know the longer you're out, the more work for everyone else.
Get better.
You feeling okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, just, uh, nerves.
That's normal.
I'm gonna be there to make sure you're protected.
(DOOR OPENS)
Gentlemen, are we ready to make this deal?
We are.
MICHAELA: Stop it.
I just called to say hi.
LEVI: And I'm asking you to say it.
I can't. I'm at my clients'.
That's a cop-out.
I'm starting to feel a bit played here, to be honest.
You let me get a taste.
Then you leave me high and dry for days.
Fine. I'll say it.
Spank me, Daddy.
Huh? I couldn't hear you.
Oh...
Spank me, Daddy.
Louder, woman.
(MICHAELA LAUGHING)
Spank me, Daddy!
Wow.
Oh!
Uh, I'll call you later.
Caleb, hi.
Annalise sent me to start...
To start my trial prep.
I know.
You're a lawyer?
Not yet. I'm one of her students.
So my life's in the hands of someone who knows as much about the law as I do?
Great.
KAPLAN: Dr. Healy,
what can you tell us
about psychopathy, which you've spent your entire career studying?
My research has shown that an everyday high-school clique can take on the characteristics of a cult.
Take Columbine, for instance.
Eric Harris was a psychopath who manipulated the weaker-willed
Dylan Klebold into committing murder.
Like Harris,
I believe the defendant has antisocial personality disorder with prominent narcissistic and sadistic traits.
NIA: I want you
to do a favor...
Zoe then used...
NIA: for me, Annalise.
I want you to kill me.
This is inappropriate.
Just get me the pills.
You wouldn't be killing me.
I would do that myself.
It's called secobarbital.
I take it, and I'm asleep, just like that.
No. Listen,
I'm not a drug dealer.
But that guy you have working for you, he has access, right?
The one you used to frame Nate.
You owe me this, Annalise.
For sleeping with my husband, that's bad enough.
But really, for what you put him through.
He had to go through that trial alone.
He had to sit in that courtroom alone, because I couldn't be there.
You did that.
Listen, I can't imagine what you're feeling right now.
Exactly. So you don't get to say no.
Oh, please.
Please. Nobody will help me.
The nurses, they're all on Nate's team, but you...
You owe me this.
JUDGE: Does that
sound fair to you,
Ms. Keating?
JUDGE: Ms. Keating.
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Would you like a recess before your cross of
Dr. Healy?
That sounds great.
We'll resume in 15.
(GAVEL BANGS)
Everything okay?
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?
Frank, I need your help.
I can't go anywhere.
I'm at work.
LEVI: So?
You got more important
things on your plate.
I've got to get out of this dump of an apartment.
Okay, the guy who sleeps in his car doesn't get to rip on my apartment.
Whatever. Just give me the name of this cop.
I'll go find out what he knows.
He doesn't even know you exist.
Then tell him.
I can't. What...
Did you find any dirt on our expert?
I think so. In 2009, he had a 15-year-old patient named Tyler Douglas.
Dr. Healy was treating him for schizophrenia in the hospital, but decided to release him back to his parents' care in time for...
ANNALISE: Christmas, which is when
Tyler put padlocks on all the bedroom doors in his family's house and lit the Christmas tree on fire, thereby killing his parents and one-year-old sister.
This was after you gave him a complete remission diagnosis.
Isn't that right?
You managed to find the most difficult case in my career.
Difficult because your misdiagnosis led to the death of three people?
Objection, Your Honor.
Assumes facts not in evidence.
Withdrawn.
Given the subjective nature of your field, Dr. Healy, is it possible that you've given
Zoe Mitchell the wrong diagnosis?
Objection, Your Honor.
Outside the scope of direct.
This is an expert giving an opinion within the scope of his expertise.
What I do, it's not an exact science, so of course it's possible.
Seems a shame to persecute an innocent girl based on a hunch.
Your Honor.
Relax. No further questions.
Annalise strikes again.
Nothing like burning babies when you want to sway the jury.
Wes, where are you going?
We did our job.
I did that job, and Annalise is gonna notice if you leave.
Let her.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
Oh, crap.
Hey.
What did they say to you?
Nothing.
You can tell me.
If they were bullying you, it could help our case.
They just said that I'm a slut.
It's fine, and it's kind of true.
No, it's not fine.
That's how people get in your head.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Actually, uh,
I do.
Look, we've all had people in our lives that, that make us do bad stuff.
Like stabbing your best friend a million times while she begs you to stop?
Zoe, your mom.
Projecting onto the sociopath much?
She's not a sociopath.
Or so she says.
NATE: You can't be here.
Just tell me what you found out.
I will when there's something to know.
Right now, I'm spending time with my sick wife.
Rebecca's dead.
Maybe she wasn't my wife, but now she's dead.
So I'm sorry, but I can't just wait for you to make time to deal with this.
Please, Nate, just tell me what you know.
Frank made three calls the night Rebecca disappeared.
To who?
Does it matter?
No, I...
I'm not gonna tell anyone.
WES: Her name's
Sabrina Mancini.
LEVI: Nice work.
I'm all over it.
Wait. Wait! (SIGHING)
Just find out who she is.
Okay? Nate will kill me if he finds out about you.
Are you sure you trust this guy?
Yeah. He wants the same things we do.
You mean to kill Annalise?
Just find out who she is, nothing more.
Relax. I'll be good.
MICHAELA: You and Catherine slept through the entire night of the murder?
Yes.
Even with your parents being beaten and shot in your own home?
Our home is over
30,000 square feet.
You're elaborating.
Don't do that.
Yes.
I slept through the entire night.
And is your bedroom close to your sister's?
Yes.
Do you ever visit each other in the middle of the night?
Why don't you just flat-out ask me if I'm screwing her?
No, that's not what...
This is all a routine part of...
'Cause the answer is yes.
We're in love.
Have been ever since we were kids.
We're actually planning on getting married as soon as the inheritance comes in.
This is a hard process.
I understand that.
You understand nothing.
I was six when they adopted me.
Everybody wanted babies, little white babies.
But my parents chose me.
And now the whole world thinks I killed them.
Why? Because I look different than them?
Okay. That's a little bit "victimy," don't you think?
No, but that was a little bit bitchy.
Excuse me?
I'm your client.
You work for me.
Exactly.
I'm on your side here.
No one's on our side.
That's the only thing
I know at this point.
I'm adopted.
Not to a family of billionaires, but let's just say they're people I don't really relate to.
So, yes, maybe
I don't understand about everything you're going through, but I understand much more than you think.
I'm sorry...
It's okay.
But that's bull.
You haven't been accused of murder.
And, yeah, maybe I need to suck it up...
Be strong.
But what's happening to me, what's happening to Catherine, it's not okay.
CATHERINE: Caleb?
Is everything all right?
Molly's gonna take the stand to testify tomorrow.
So she can tell all the lies she wants about Zoe. Lovely.
Don't worry, I know how to take down a teenager.
Dad, I can't find my phone.
Well, use mine.
LISA: No, no, no.
Don't give her yours.
Zoe, go and find yours.
This is the fourth one you've had.
Go and find it...
JUDGE MILLSTONE: I'm not letting my son be your informant until he has full immunity.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
EMILY: Let's not overplay our hand here, Judge.
After all, the only reason we're here is because of what happened to an innocent girl.
We're not here because of Tiffany Howard.
We're here because
Annalise Keating is a criminal who finally needs to be stopped.
ASHER OVER RECORDING:
Yo, what's up?
Asher-ony McHorny here.
Leave me a message.
(BEEP)
Hey. I need to know if you're coming into work tomorrow.
Call me back.
Frank.
That guy who traces phones, can you have him call me?
No way.
I'm not gonna let you become the crazy ex who stalks douche face.
Not even if I tell you what Laurel said about you when we had drinks the other night?
You two had drinks?
Yep. I think she's falling for you.
She said that?
No, but now I know you're falling for her.
Okay, now you're the douche face.
Just have your guy call me.
(LAUREL SPEAKING SPANISH)
What's the verdict?
Is Caleb diddling sissy?
I don't think so.
Why not?
I don't know, he just he seems more normal than I thought.
Are you into him?
LAUREL: Into who?
No one.
CONNOR: Caleb.
LAUREL: Go for it.
Look at all the fun we got out of Wes dating Rebecca.
Okay, you're all sick in the head, and I have a boyfriend, thank you very much.
What, are you and dirty Levi already exclusive?
No, I mean, no, we haven't officially had that conversation yet, but we're enjoying each other's company.
Let's just say that.
Stay away from Michaela, or I tell her who you are.
Deal.
CONNOR: Naked company, I hope.
Where are you going now?
My torts study group is meeting tonight.
ANNALISE: Miss Pratt, what did you find out?
Uh, nothing definitive yet.
(DOOR OPENS)
What's the matter?
(DOOR CLOSES)
You don't know how to use your boobs?
I told you to stay away from her.
Calm down. I'm not gonna hurt her.
I trusted you, lied to Nate for you.
Maybe you shouldn't have.
Look, somebody in that house killed my sister, so, yeah, I'm gonna lie to people if that means finding out who did it.
Rebecca lied to me.
Over and over.
And I kept believing her.
I can't be around people like that anymore.
Get the hell out.
Dude.
Just leave.
Look, I found the lady Frank called.
Sabrina Mancini.
You want to know who she is?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
I stole Zoe's phone.
What?
I think she's a sociopath.
You stole our client's phone, you're the sociopath.
Yeah, but I've been watching her, and she's on her phone all of the time.
She's 16. That's what they do.
Yeah, but I didn't buy that sob story, so I just took her phone when she wasn't looking, and I called my cousin, you know, the 15-year-old, and she told me about "H.A.S."
Hidden away safe.
What are you talking about?
Okay, it's this app that kids use to hide stuff from their parents.
The little icon looks like this calculator, so that no one would think to look at it.
And what do I care?
Look.
Stop it! Why are you doing this to me?
ZOE: Okay, now squeal
like a little piggy,
like Rachel did.
MEGAN: Yeah,
little fat piggy bitch.
(GIRLS LAUGHING)
Stop!
Ow! I want my mommy!
(LAUGHING)
ZOE: Oh, my gosh.
You know, we should
do it again.
MEGAN: What?
MOLLY: Yeah, what are you talking about?
You know, like, kill someone.
Like Mrs. Collins?
You know, she
gave me a "C,"
so we should
carve a "C" into
her forehead right
before we gut her.
You know, we should do it again.
MEGAN: What?
MOLLY: Yeah, what're you talking about?
You know, like, kill someone.
Like Mrs. Collins?
You know,
she gave me a "C,"
so we should
carve a "C" into
her forehead right
before we gut her.
Stop it. Please.
That's not...
She doesn't know what she's saying.
They made Zoe do this.
No one can see this.
Get rid of it.
Of course.
We're what?
Burying the footage so we win the case.
But she's a violent killer, who wants to violently kill again.
You're the one that was all,
"Poor Zoe" yesterday...
Yeah, well, that was before we knew she was mental.
Our job, Mr. Walsh, is to defend our client against the crime for which she's charged, not a hypothetical future crime.
But she's dangerous, and she's good at it.
I mean, the video is proof.
ANNALISE: Proof of what?
That teenage girls can be stupid and pretend for each other?
We swore an oath to mount a vigorous defense, and, yes, that includes winning.
So stop being so damn sensitive and get on board.
Are there any other copies?
No, just the one on her phone.
Good, delete any record of them anywhere, especially the damn cloud, worst thing ever invented.
Hang on a sec.
Of course she doesn't care.
I mean, she's a psychopath, too.
We've represented worse people than that, Connor.
You sound just like her.
Just know that all these ideas in your head, they're hers.
Do you actually think that murdering someone is not a big deal anymore?
Who's next on our hit list, the dean?
He's a wise-ass.
Here.
Thank you.
Should I be worried?
No. Go be nosey somewhere else.
CATHERINE:
I take a sleeping pill
every night.
Insomnia.
So it's pretty normal for me to sleep through the night.
That's your excuse for not hearing those gunshots that night?
It's not an excuse, but the truth.
You're quick on your feet.
That's good.
When you woke up the next morning...
Do you like him?
Caleb?
Girls like him.
I mean, the money helps, but he looks like he looks, and I wouldn't be surprised if you had a crush.
I don't have a crush.
He's our client, and that would be inappropriate.
You can't control a crush, though.
Are you deflecting because you're afraid
I'm gonna find out you're in love with your brother?
You actually think it's possible to grow up in a house like this, with people working behind every corner, and get away with screwing your brother?
According to your house manager, you didn't get away with it.
Something that perverse should never be private.
They're guilty.
Fine.
Let's just put this to bed once and for all.
You really want to know the truth?
KAPLAN: Molly, did you ever feel bullied by Zoe?
Yes, she would be really nice one minute, then can turn on you the next.
She seemed to like scaring people.
And do you remember what you said when I first asked you to testify?
I said I wouldn't do it
'cause Zoe would try to kill me if I did.
Objection.
This is a speculation of a young girl desperate to pass blame.
Sustained.
Molly, isn't it true that you and your friends like to record videos of yourselves?
Yes, we recorded everything.
Your Honor, I would like to introduce into evidence a video taken just days after Rachel's murder.
ANNALISE: Objection. This video wasn't in discovery.
That's true, because my witness is so terrified of Zoe Mitchell that she didn't tell me about the video until this morning.
The timing of this is very convenient,
Your Honor.
JUDGE: I agree.
Young lady, why didn't you tell anyone about this video before?
Honestly, I thought it would make me look guilty if I did.
Stop it! Why are you doing this to me?
Okay, now squeal like
a little piggy,
like Rachel did.
MEGAN: Yeah, little fat piggy bitch.
(LAUGHING)
MOLLY: Ah! Stop!
Ow! I want my mommy!
LISA: You said they'd never see it!
Molly must have had a copy, too.
That's no excuse!
Calm down. Calm down.
People say you're the best.
But from what I've seen, you're distracted, unprepared.
The case isn't over yet.
LISA: It might as well be.
I put my baby's life in your hands.
So if I lose her, it's on you.
Fix it.
NATE: You all right?
We shouldn't be seen together.
I know.
Nice to see you, though.
I saw Nia, Nate.
When?
The other morning, she called me on your phone.
Why?
She wanted to talk.
Why?
NIA: The nurses, they're all on Nate's team, but you...
You owe me this.
No. If I owe anyone, it's Nate.
Do it for him.
Free him.
Because as long as I'm alive, he's in pain.
Oh, God. He loves you.
Yes, but he's not happy.
That's why I told him to keep seeing you.
You let him forget me and this hospital, but then you destroyed him.
You think this is gonna help him?
God, if you can't do this for me, if you can't do this for him, just do it for yourself.
I don't care.
Just be a good person for once and get me the pills.
I'm not promising anything.
NIA: Annalise.
Don't tell Nate.
She's worried about you.
That's all.
I'm sorry.
She shouldn't have done that.
It's okay.
I'm glad she did.
She wants the best for you.
(GIRLS LAUGHING)
ZOE: I'll bet she's sorry now.
That'll teach her to steal your boyfriend, right?
Yeah. Skanks get shanked.
Skanks get shanked.
Bam.
Yeah. Skanks get shanked.
Skanks get shanked.
MEGAN: Bam.
(LAUGHING)
ANNALISE: Molly, isn't it true that you were the only one with motive to kill Rachel?
I mean, she did steal your boyfriend, after all.
She was talking to him, yes, but...
Let's look at the video again.
MEGAN:
That will teach her to steal
your boyfriend, right?
MOLLY: Yeah.
Skanks get shanked.
Skanks get shan...
ANNALISE: So, is the skank you're referring to in the video, Rachel?
Yes.
So when you say,
"Skanks get shanked,"
Zoe copies what you say.
She did that a lot, didn't she?
MOLLY: I don't know what you mean.
I mean right here.
You're leading, and she's following.
Yeah. Skanks get shanked.
Skanks get shanked.
MEGAN: Bam.
(LAUGHING)
It looks to me that she's mirroring your behavior, isn't she?
I mean, look at her body language.
She's literally looking to you to see what to do next.
Because she's afraid of you, isn't she?
It wasn't like that.
We didn't even like Zoe.
We only hung out with her because she was Rachel's friend.
That's not true.
Shh.
So Zoe would hang out with you, because you were the popular one?
I don't know.
Objection. Speculation.
I'm asking the witness if she forced Zoe into her clique, Your Honor.
I didn't, though.
Zoe forced her way in.
ANNALISE: So you're admitting you had a clique.
That's a lie. She wanted to be friends with me.
Zoe.
ANNALISE:
Which means that it was up to you and you alone, Molly, whether she was allowed in.
I told you, we liked Rachel, not Zoe.
Then why did you decide
Rachel had to die?
Control Ms. Keating,
Your Honor.
I don't know why!
All I know is that Zoe forced herself onto us, and then everything was awful after that!
You're a liar!
You were nothing until you met me, just some stuck-up bitch until I made you interesting!
Counselor, get your client under control.
ZOE: You think that you're anything without me?
You are nothing!
You're just some basic bitch who better watch her back!
That's right!
You're next, whore!
You were supposed to fix this, but instead you let her get up there and tell lies about me!
TOM: Zoe, stop it!
ZOE: I hate you. And you.
I hate you all.
ANNALISE: You slipped them that video.
I'm not sorry that I did it.
I would do it again, too.
Even if that means you lose.
You actually think that murdering someone is not a big deal anymore?
CONNOR: Who's next on our hit list, the dean?
What is your problem, Mr. Walsh?
Are you unhappy?
Do you want to leave?
I can't leave.
Door is right there.
Yeah, and you would send Frank to kill me on my way out.
Don't get confused.
You're the only killer in this room.
I did not kill anyone.
You killed my husband.
No, Wes killed your husband.
And he only did it because you messed with his head.
How dare you put that on me.
I protected you, even when I didn't have to out of the kindness of my heart, and I'm still protecting you every damn day.
So don't believe that crock of defense I spun in court.
That was just an easy out so the jury could have someone to blame.
But that's not what's happening here.
You made this life for yourself,
Mr. Walsh, not me.
No, Zoe would have killed again, and I cannot deal with any more blood on my hands.
You know where else there's blood?
My husband's, to be specific?
Your car.
CONNOR: Maybe Sam knows.
I mean, he's lived here the longest, right?
What, any ideas, pal?
Laurel said that
Frank got rid of it.
My car was stolen.
Bummer.
Good work with Connor's car.
You stole it.
That's a lie.
Make me out to be the villain if that helps you sleep at night.
But don't you ever screw with my cases.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Come in.
Oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to...
Mr. Walsh was just leaving.
What is it?
Good news, Catherine's a virgin.
Well.
Finally, something that we can prove.
CALEB: This is so weird.
You get that, right?
How weird this is?
I do, but I'd be a horrible lawyer if I didn't advise Catherine to take this step.
Okay, but is there even a test to prove this?
Seriously. She grew up riding horses.
ANNALISE: Maybe it won't work, but if there's a chance I can put a doctor on the stand to say that Catherine is a virgin, then I can cast doubt on the incest rumors, thereby weakening the prosecution's case.
It's up to you, Catherine.
I have other ways to win this, but...
I'll do it.
Cat.
You need to think about this.
If it helps us win, they can run as many tests on me as they want.
Let's do it.
Call the doctor right now.
I told you to use your boobs, not your heart.
What?
You know what I'm talking about.
Put 'em away.
We're done with them.
Am I an idiot if I believe they didn't do it?
No. It just means you still want to see the best in people.
Hold onto that if you can.
CATHERINE: Hi.
I passed.
LEVI: I'm staking out Sabrina's place, and I see this guy coming and going.
It's her brother,
Bruno, who, turns out,
Frank went to high school with.
Why did Frank call Bruno?
'Cause he needed help dumping
Rebecca's body, and Bruno...
Works here.
Thank you.
Should I be worried?
ANNALISE:
This is inappropriate.
NIA: Do you love him?
I want you to help me end it.
NIA: Just get me the pills.
You wouldn't be killing me.
But that guy you have working for you, he has access, right?
The one you used to frame Nate.
She wants the best for you.
NIA: You owe me this, Annalise.
You let him forget.
But then you destroyed him.
Be a good person for once.
I think about it a lot.
Killing myself.
I have ever since I was a child.
A lot of times,
I think the world would be a much better place without me in it.
But I don't do it.
You're a better woman than me.
And if I don't deserve to die, then you definitely don't.
I'm sorry you feel alone in your pain, but so do I.
So does everybody.
That's life.
I really thought you'd do it.
I mean, you've killed before.
Sam.
I'm not the woman you think I am.
I'm sorry I can't help you.
I'll call the judge and have him sign the deal first thing in the morning.
JUDGE MILLSTONE:
Call me with any problems.
There won't be. Cheer up.
You'll testify tomorrow and be home in time to play beer pong with your buddies.
Good night.
(SIGHING)
Thank you, Dad.
Okay.
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)
(ENGINE STARTING)
Hi.
That guy who traces phones, can you have him call me?
Why are you doing this?
Sinclair knows that Annalise got
Nate to murder Sam, and so do I.
And I know that you and Frank are helping her cover it up, and don't say it's not true, because I work in that house, too.
The whispers, Frank being shady all the time, the three of you hiding stuff from us...
I'm not dumb, Bon.
And it's not right.
You're wrong.
No, she should pay for what she did.
And you can call me a snitch or a liar or whatever you want...
I killed him, Asher.
What?
I killed Sam.
I know where Rebecca's body is.
Strathaven Cemetery.
That's where
Sabrina Mancini's brother works.
He's the groundskeeper.
So that explains why
Frank called three times the night Rebecca disappeared.
I didn't want to believe it at first.
But when we found out where Bruno works...
Who's "we"?
Levi.
He grew up with Rebecca.
You're such an idiot.
He's Rebecca's foster brother.
We can trust him.
Because that's what he told you?
And you believed him?
I'm putting everything on the line to help you, my badge, what's left of my rep, and you go off and sell it to some stranger?
And how do you know this guy didn't kill Rebecca and now he's playing you?
You're a fool, Wes.
MALE MEDIC:
Heart race's increasing.
Pulse is diminishing.
I need four units of vasopressin.
FEMALE MEDIC: Copy that.
MAN OVER RADIO: GSW patient's arrived at the hospital.
Marked hypertension with respiratory arrest.
I.V.'s running and wide open, but no...
Well, that's great news, isn't it?
Why don't we all just keep driving and find a cliff and we can all go out
Thelma & Louise style?
It's gonna be fine.
CONNOR: You don't know that.
Maybe not.
But I do know worrying about things that are out of our control is the only way we get in trouble right now.
Really? I think killing someone is another way we can get in trouble.
Hey, the reason you're all gonna be okay, you got me.
I know what I'm doing.
So stop freaking out and focus on the plan.
Michaela, you ready to do this?
And not screw up?
Well, maybe if you all stop doubting me...
Relax. I got this.
So, who's up for a drink?
(SIGHS)
How is she?
Good.

## S02E5

ANNALISE: Previously on
How to Get Away With Murder...
FEMALE MEDIC:
You stay with me, ma'am.
Charge to 300.
FEMALE MEDIC: Charging.
How is she?
Good.
I cannot deal with any more blood on my hands.
Why did Frank call Bruno?
'Cause he needed help dumping Rebecca's body.
But when we found out where Bruno works...
Who's "we"?
Levi.
How do you know this guy didn't kill Rebecca and now he's playing you?
REPORTER: The victim is none other than Helena Hapstall...
I was at home, witnessing my niece and nephew murder their parents.
I'm gonna be there to make sure you're protected.
Gentlemen, are we ready to make this deal?
Sinclair knows that Annalise got
Nate to murder Sam.
I killed him, Asher.
What?
I killed Sam.
(PANTING)
You okay?
It's almost over.
Promise.
JUDGE MILLSTONE:
(INDISTINCTLY) I told your mom we were talking again.
But don't worry.
She doesn't know about any of this.
(CLEARLY)
She's just happy we're on the mend.
MAN: All rise.
Take your seats.
This is a closed hearing for a wiretap warrant on the residence of Annalise Keating, due to the corroborating testimony of the informant,
Asher Millstone.
By testifying to the misconduct of Miss Keating, he will receive full immunity in this case, as well as the closed file entitled
"Trotter Lake grand jury investigation."
BONNIE: I killed Sam.
I was alone in the house.
I was...
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Working a case for Annalise, and Sam came home.
(VOICE BREAKING)
He was drunk, and he started rubbing my shoulders...
Telling me I work too much, but that he was...
Glad he always had me to come home to.
And then he pressed himself against me, and I felt that he was...
So I tried to move, but he just held me there, and he said he saw how I looked at him, and he knew I wanted it.
And he wasn't wrong, not completely, but I didn't want it, not that way, so I told him no, and he just held me there, tighter and tighter, and I...
It happened so fast.
He was on top of me, and he went to pull down his pants, and I grabbed the lamp.
I hit him over and over, and I...
I don't know where it came from, but I couldn't stop.
Sinclair is wrong, Asher, about everything.
So if you help her, we're all ruined.
But mostly me.
JUDGE:
Let's begin, Miss Sinclair.
EMILY:
Thank you,
Your Honor.
I'd like to call
Asher Millstone to the stand.
I have to go.
Asher.
Stop him.
Asher, come back here. Son!
You should've called me.
I had no time.
I had to make a decision.
It's going to work, Annalise.
Why? Because you've been sleeping with the boy for a few months?
I know him.
I knew Sam for 20 years, and look how that turned out.
Men lie, Bonnie.
It's all they're good at.
She's right.
ANNALISE: Of course I am.
MICHAELA: It's about Sam.
Or Eggs 911 finally showed his face.
No, it's probably just about the Hapstalls, like they killed another witness.
They wouldn't be all whispery behind closed doors if it was about our stupid clients.
You all are the stupid ones.
Is that a beer?
Yes, it is, Michaela.
Because you want to get fired?
No, because Annalise has been hiding my car in case she needs to blackmail me.
No, Frank got rid of your car.
He lied.
Or that's what Annalise told me.
Who knows?
Maybe she's lying about that, too.
My point is, chill out, grab a beer, and accept the fact that our lives belong to her.
ANNALISE:
I caught Wes and Nate together last night.
Screwing?
No, working together behind my back.
Find out what they know, if it's about Rebecca.
On it.
(DOOR OPENS)
You would've handled this another way.
I know that.
Stop.
Nothing you say will make me not hate you right now.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
It's the courthouse.
(CONTINUES RINGING)
Answer it.
This is Bonnie Winterbottom.
Mmm-hmm.
Okay. I'll let her know.
That was Judge Garret about the Hapstall case.
Thank God.
She wants to see you at 11:00.
Today?
ASHER:
Get out of my frickin' way,
Frank.
Move, or I break your face.
Calm the hell down.
ASHER: She knows what the hell this is about.
It's okay, Frank.
See?
Annalise, he could have a wire.
I don't.
He says he doesn't have one.
Come in.
We need to do this alone.
You heard him.
Asher knows about Sam?
No.
Then why is he freaking out?
Who knows?
You know.
You need to tell us.
This involves us, Frank.
It's nothing to worry about.
And don't any of you try to talk to him, okay?
We've got eyes on doucheface like we got eyes on all of you.
Drink 'em if you got 'em.
ASHER: Is it true?
It's true.
Sam put on a good face, but, deep down,
I married a man that
I didn't really know.
Then why didn't you call the cops?
Why didn't you tell them it was self-defense?
I had to look at the facts of the case.
He only attempted rape.
He didn't actually do it, so I knew we'd lose.
So you thought your only option was to frame Nate?
That makes no sense.
Only because you're a man.
I don't blame you.
You were never taught not to be one.
And then you add your whiteness on top of that.
The police are trained to believe you.
But when a woman says that she was raped, the law rarely takes our side, and definitely not when the man is not alive to defend himself, so we take other actions, protect ourselves in a way that we know the system never will.
You have two options.
Testify to everything that you know, and Bonnie and me will likely go to jail, or you say nothing, and we stay safe and so do you.
I need to think about it.
Where the hell did you go?
I'm sorry.
I don't care if you're sorry.
We just lost the judge to her other case.
I know more than
I first told you.
About what?
Don't answer that.
I know who killed Sam Keating.
JUDGE MILLSTONE: Do you have any idea what you just did?
Dad, just listen to me.
No, you just admitted that you knowingly withheld material evidence in an ongoing murder investigation.
Please, let me explain.
Quiet, quiet.
Who did it, Asher?
Who killed Sam?
He's not answering that.
Fine.
You can tell me when I get back.
You're leaving?
Yeah, the judge on the Hapstall case wants me in a meeting, and if I don't show up,
Miss Keating will be suspicious.
Actually, don't we need to rework my immunity deal?
I mean, the current one only covers me for testifying against Annalise's professional illegal misconduct, not for the murder of Sam Keating, so we need a new one, right?
One that covers misprision of felony or whatever other illegal crap
I've now committed?
EMILY: Pardon my tardiness,
Your Honor.
Been a heck of a day already.
Join the club.
Let's not waste any more time.
We're here to discuss
Miss Sinclair's motion to include Helena Hapstall's testimony in the trial.
I wasn't aware of any motion, Your Honor.
Because my office only received it at 4:58 p.m. yesterday, two minutes before the deadline.
So it would give me no time to challenge it.
Challenge it now.
We're all here.
You were gaming the deadline, Counselor, which gives me more than enough cause to reject this motion...
But, Judge... if I did not feel like this testimony is pivotal to your case.
It is, Your Honor.
I can't cross-examine a dead woman before the jury.
It's not my fault your clients slashed her throat.
They were cleared in that case.
JUDGE: Quiet.
Miss Keating, you had no opportunity to cross-examine the witness, but your clients' previous counsel did, so any objections to testimony should have been raised then.
For the sake of fairness,
I will hear any arguments against this motion at 5:00.
That gives me no time to prepare.
I agree, Your Honor.
I'll need time to prepare any rebuttal.
Because you allowed Miss Keating the same courtesy?
No, I have a new trial starting tomorrow, so we're getting this over with.
Don't show up,
I'll just rule in the other side's favor.
(SIGHS)
CONNOR: Hey, wait list.
Did Rebecca leave keys to the trap house before she ran for the hills?
What?
We are almost out of beer, and I would like something more hardcore.
We might as well have an orgy, too.
Yes! I like it!
Go out with a bang.
Who's in?
I'm not playing this game.
This might be the end, Michaela.
Michaela, would you like to go to jail without having an orgasm?
Because you're gonna help me with that?
I'm willing to give it a shot.
Back off. She's mine.
Okay, you're both disgusting, and I'm never gonna be able to look at you the same way again.
LAUREL: Oh! Just wait until we've seen each other naked.
Can't wait to see what the puppy here is packing.
Not gonna happen.
I have to go.
You can't leave.
We need another penis in the mix.
Ask Frank.
Ooh! If the beard's in,
I might reconsider.
Excuse me?
All's fair in an orgy, right?
Where do you think you're going?
Nowhere. I...
Homework.
Well, now we've got real work.
Follow me.
Now.
ANNALISE:
We have until 5:00 p.m.
to get the aunt's testimony thrown out.
Her eyewitness account is the only thing that places
Caleb and Catherine at the murder scene, and since the police never found a gun, she's the strongest evidence that the DA's got.
But she's dead.
Which damns our clients even more.
So comb through this discovery.
Find proof that she lied about what she saw.
How do you know she lied?
(SIGHS) I don't.
But it's the only way we get the testimony thrown out.
Have fun.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
All we need now is a ball gag.
Where are you?
Outside Asher's.
He just got home.
When's the warrant hearing?
It was pushed.
I have a feeling he bought himself time.
You have a feeling?
I'll call you back.
Hey.
Don't worry.
I haven't told
Sinclair anything.
Yet.
I have some questions.
Of course.
Frank helped you, right?
It's not like you and Annalise carried that body into the woods.
(GRUNTING)
He did.
And the others, did they know, too?
ASHER: I see your car in the driveway, Connor.
Open up the damn door!
No, they were already at the bonfire.
And they can't know anything, Asher.
You can't tell them.
Okay.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
One more.
When you came over, and we...
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
That was just for your alibi, right?
Yes.
That's just how we started.
But it's not at all how I feel about you now.
Thanks for telling me the truth.
(CAR DOOR SHUTS)
FRANK: Phone records.
Nate was too smart to talk to Wes on his cell, but look at the puppy's.
Keeps calling the same number.
Who is it?
Levi Wescott,
Rebecca's foster brother.
Where are you?
Just keeping an eye on our guy Bruno.
WES: Well, stop.
I talked to Nate, and he promised he was gonna look into him.
And you think your cop buddy's gonna handle this the right way?
Yes. And what does the "Right way" mean?
(BEEPING)
I'll call you later.
ANNALISE: They're dating?
Michaela's pretty much the only other number he calls, but I don't think she knows who he is.
But Wes does?
Jerk move, right?
I, uh, can't hang out tonight.
LEVI: You always have to work.
Yeah, I go to law school, and I have a job.
Well, at least send me a picture of your panties.
I don't sext, but they're pink with white lace, and I have a tiny, itty...
Is this what you call working, dirty talk on the phone?
No, I was just...
You have five hours
'til the hearing.
Get your thumbs out of your asses and get me proof that dead woman lied.
You still have my phone.
Keep them away from this Levi.
Where are you going?
To kick some ass.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Hey.
I'm sorry.
I know you said you needed time to figure this...
Us out, but I couldn't keep things from you anymore.
What the hell's that mean, Annalise?
I lied.
About why Nia wanted to see me.
I saw Nia, Nate.
Why?
She wanted to talk.
She wanted me to get her pills.
Tell me you didn't say yes.
Of course not.
And I promised her that I wouldn't tell you.
But I didn't want there to be any more secrets between us.
Because I'm tired.
And I know you are, too.
I'll talk to her.
Nate.
I'm here for whatever you need.
Thanks.
(DOOR CLOSES)
What's wrong?
Nothing.
(GASPING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
That was great, but I thought we were getting to know each other.
Enough with that line.
We might be going to jail, Frank, or maybe we're not, but all I know is you don't want to tell us what's going on, which is fine.
Do what you need to do.
But what I need right now is to get my mind off the doom.
(MOANING AND PANTING)
Laurel.
What?
You don't want this?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
They'll hear us.
Only if you make me scream.
You've lost it.
(CONTINUES MOANING)
(CLATTERING)
(MOANING AND GASPING)
Where's Annalise?
I'll tell you if you let us know what's going on with Asher.
That doesn't concern you.
Bull.
Oh, my God.
Look at this.
It's from a cop's dashcam the morning after the murder.
This is the aunt.
(CRYING) I told Grant,
"Do not bring those
mongrels into your home!"
Mongrels?
Shh.
"They'll turn on you."
And they did.
They killed him and Ursula.
No, you can't trust people like that.
Those Orientals, those mulattos!
Well, hello, old-school racist.
It's in their nature!
OFFICER: Ma'am,
I need you to calm down.
CALEB: Such a sweet old lady, right?
HELENA: I'm telling you,
those two murdered my
brother and his wife!
OFFICER: How do you know that?
Did you hear anything last night?
MICHAELA:
Caleb, wait. Caleb!
Oh! Right,
I forgot why I came here in the first place.
Annalise asked if we had anything to help discredit Aunt Helena.
I figured her drug addiction might help.
Caleb, it's horrible.
She...
She's horrible, but it does help your case.
How?
The footage shows her bias against you.
It proves she had reason to lie about that night.
But she wasn't lying.
You were in your parents' room that night?
No, I just mean, traumatized or not, what she said, that was as honest as I've ever seen her.
And she was my family, sat across the table from me at every
Thanksgiving, Christmas.
We'd laugh about her bitchy socialite friends or whatever husband she was divorcing at the time because I thought
I was in on the joke, but that whole time,
I was the joke.
At least I don't have to feel bad about her being dead anymore.
We'll get her testimony thrown out.
Or you won't.
Thank you for trying, though.
EMILY: A new contract, full immunity on both
Trotter Lake and any connection to the murder of Sam Keating, provided, of course, that your intel leads to a conviction.
It's a good deal, son.
I need a minute with my father.
Fine.
(DOOR CLOSES)
You know Annalise is gonna come after you, too, for the David Allen case.
I did nothing wrong there.
Dad, we're both here because of stupid stuff I did in my past, so you can be honest about yours.
We're both adults here.
And I'm the only adult with an actual career to lose.
Did you...
You cut a deal for yourself, didn't you?
Of course I did.
God.
(VOICE BREAKING)
Is there any part of you that thought that,
"Maybe I should just do this to protect my kid
"and not to protect myself?"
I'm protecting the both of us.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
But mostly you, Dad.
HELENA: Those Orientals, those mulattos!
It's in their nature!
OFFICER: Ma'am,
I need you to calm down.
HELENA: Are you listening to me?
I'm telling you,
those two murdered
my brother and his wife!
How do you know that?
Did you hear anything
last night?
What?
It just cuts out there.
'Cause it's been edited.
We don't have proof of that.
Well, there's a bias argument.
She's a bigot.
That doesn't mean she lied in her testimony.
Please, you've won cases with less.
You think I don't notice what's happening here?
Day drinking, acting out against me?
I miss that man
I first gave that trophy to.
She's right.
Come on, let's go win this.
What's going on?
Racism.
Where were you?
Looking through more discovery.
Well, at least someone got her jollies today.
Well, got to get it in while you can.
Hey, do you think Annalise would ever pay me?
I mean, I do all this work for her for free.
You don't want to work for Annalise.
Trust your boyfriend on that one.
Bathroom?
It's through the bedroom.
Man, I hack into the police department, like, every other week for you guys.
(COMPUTER BEEPS)
Not that I mind it, but I should probably get paid if I'm risking jail time.
I might be going to jail, Oliver.
(CHUCKLES)
Very funny.
I'm not kidding.
Uh, what for?
I can't say.
Connor.
Look, I wish
I could. I do.
But you'd get in trouble.
So this isn't just about the hacking?
Okay, this is so mean.
I know.
Just know that meeting you and everything that we have, it's everything.
I mean, you mean everything.
I love you, Oli.
So, did we find the rest of the video?
Uh... No.
No, but, um, getting closer.
EMILY: Two more of whatever he's having.
You're not gonna get me drunk and convince me to sign this deal.
I know.
You don't know who killed Sam Keating.
Not for sure, at least.
That was a stall tactic, a very smart one.
I understand why you did it.
This can't be an easy decision for you to make.
Then don't make me make it.
I wish I had that much power.
You do.
And Sam Keating was not a good guy.
He knocked up a law student, and he strangled her with his bare hands.
Who cares if he's dead?
Me.
Why?
He was murdered, Asher.
Maybe working in that house has messed with your head a bit, but people can't get away with killing each other.
And definitely not if you're a woman who's responsible for educating an entire generation of law students.
What, you think the world's just gonna be full of Annalise Mini-Mes, that we're gonna be walking around killing people for fun?
You did a bad thing when you were younger.
Who hasn't?
But Annalise should know better at this point.
And so should you.
That's the choice you have to make.
Do you want to be like her, or do you want to be a good guy?
Don't overcomplicate it.
MICHAELA: Oliver couldn't find the rest of the dashcam video, and the cops deleted the part that they didn't want us to see off the server, too.
Well, they did something smart for once.
No, they forgot to delete the audio.
HELENA: Are you listening to me?
I'm telling you,
those two murdered
my brother and his wife!
OFFICER: How do you know that?
Did you hear
anything last night?
What?
OFFICER: You say
your niece and nephew
murdered your brother.
How do you know that?
HELENA: I don't know.
I just...
OFFICER: Did you see anything?
Hear screams?
A gunshot, maybe?
HELENA: I just...
I'm not sure
I heard anything.
I was just so tired.
OFFICER: Okay, okay, take a deep breath.
(HELENA GROANS)
It's very important you remember anything
that happened last night.
HELENA: Oh, I don't remember anything.
(VOICE BREAKING)
All I know is
that my brother
shouldn't have ever let those half-breeds into his home!
OFFICER: Okay, ma'am,
let's find you
a quiet place...
So, Detective, that was Miss Hapstall moments after she heard about the murders.
Six hours later, you conducted your first interview with her.
Here's the transcript.
Can you read the highlighted section?
My question to Miss Hapstall,
"Did you hear anything odd the night before?"
Her reply,
"I heard screams at about 9:30 p.m."
ANNALISE: Notice a difference between that statement and the recording you just heard, Detective?
I wasn't at the crime scene.
I can't speak to what was said there.
ANNALISE:
But it was only during your interview that Miss Hapstall claimed to hear anything that night, which I can only assume means that you fed her the information.
Your Honor, it's just been brought to my attention that the dashcam audio was not in discovery.
Because it's exculpatory evidence that the DA didn't want us to hear.
So you're admitting the recording wasn't in discovery,
Miss Keating?
All I know is that it showed up on my desk.
Pardon my French,
Your Honor, but bull.
JUDGE: My suspicions are raised, too,
Miss Keating.
Do I need to open an investigation into how you obtained this recording?
ANNALISE: You wanted evidence to discredit
Helena's testimony, and I've given it to you, Your Honor.
By obtaining it illegally.
I did nothing illegal.
It was the detectives and the prosecution that hid this tape from us.
JUDGE: I will be looking into that misconduct, believe me, but that does not mean you get to bring illegally obtained evidence into my courtroom.
I'll say it again,
I did nothing illegal.
And I don't believe you.
Not to mention studies show witnesses in the midst of trauma often don't remember facts correctly at first, hence my decision.
Let the record note that the court has decided to allow the deceased's testimony to be presented at trial.
ANNALISE: Your Honor, we've just proven that the only eyewitness account in this trial was built on prejudice.
Save it for the trial,
Miss Keating.
(GAVEL BANGS)
CATHERINE:
She was a racist!
Catherine.
Okay, that's proof that she wanted us to go down for this!
Stop.
And you're black!
Out of anyone, you should get it.
Unfortunately,
I do get it,
Miss Hapstall.
But the law is the law.
It's my job to uphold it, no matter my personal feelings.
I know. I shouldn't have done that.
No, it's okay.
Someone needed to say it.
See, Michaela?
That's what happens when you don't have orgasms.
You have inappropriate explosions.
No, that was an appropriate explosion.
Sneaking off again?
We lost, and Asher's still out there.
I'm gonna go get the orgy drugs.
We can't just rush up and start asking about Rebecca.
LEVI: We're gonna smile, ask some questions.
Trust me.
He won't figure out you know Frank.
(SCOFFS) Of course he'll figure it out.
LEVI: Fine. Stay here.
(SIGHS)
LEVI: Bruno, right?
What's this about?
Frank Delfino.
BRUNO: What do you want?
I was just wondering why Frank called your sister three times the night of January 23rd.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I think you do.
Dude, you don't know what you're doing here.
He's right.
Let's go.
You go.
It'd be better if there's no witness if Bruno here keeps lying.
What am I lying about?
Frank had you dump a girl's body in this cemetery.
Okay, that's enough.
No one's getting shot here.
Put it away.
Just tell us what Frank wanted from you that night, then we'll go.
What'd I miss?
LAUREL: Nothing yet.
Did you bring the drugs?
CONNOR:
Yeah, let's cut them up and snort them before the cops come.
Screw this.
Tell us what the hell's going on.
BONNIE: Relax, Michaela.
How can I if we're about to get arrested?
No one's getting arrested.
CONNOR: How do you know that?
'Cause she does.
So back the hell off.
No.
Excuse me?
We were fine.
Annalise took care of everything, but now Asher knows what we did, which means someone talked.
And it doesn't take a genius to realize it was his girlfriend.
CONNOR: Seriously, what'd you do?
Whisper it to him during pillow talk?
If that's what happened, Bonnie,
I swear to God, we're gonna fight.
ANNALISE: You get away from her.
You want to know the truth?
Asher was gonna testify against everyone in this house, so Bonnie told him that she killed Sam in order to save your asses!
Because that's what we do around here, ruin everyone's lives to save yours!
Nate's, mine, and now Bonnie's.
Who's next, huh?
Whose life do you want to destroy to stay free?
Why didn't you just tell us?
Because I'm trying to protect you like always!
When are you gonna finally accept that?
Bonnie, Frank, in my office.
(DOOR OPENS)
BRUNO: I have no idea what you're talking about.
I think you do.
Okay, that's enough.
Just tell us what Frank wanted from you that night, then we'll go.
Frank called me that night, but only to use my storage locker, so I gave him the key.
I don't see a way out of this.
It's going to work.
Asher's not going to testify.
But what if he does?
What happens then, Bonnie?
You don't know exactly.
And what about you?
Did you handle Levi?
I'm on it.
That's a no.
We're losing.
Don't you see that?
And I don't know how to fix it this time.
Hey. We'll figure this out, like always.
I'm on Levi.
Bonnie's on Asher.
We're gonna take care of everything.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(DOOR OPENS)
Um, Bonnie...
You're sorry.
I know.
Wes, can I have a moment?
(DOOR CLOSES)
Oh, my God.
What?
You know who hasn't seemed worried this whole time?
Who keeps sneaking off?
He's the only one she really trusts.
LAUREL: He knew what was going on all along.
Screw the puppy.
He's a snake.
ANNALISE:
You left court
early today.
I had to turn in a paper for another class.
How are your other classes?
I'm passing.
You're smarter than passing.
My grades are fine.
How's everything else?
I'm sleeping better.
(SIGHS)
Lucky.
So, are you feeling okay?
About us, our relationship?
I was mad that you didn't tell us what was going on with Asher.
But now you told us.
So I guess I have nothing to be mad about.
ANNALISE:
I can't do this anymore.
NATE: Calm down.
Why didn't you tell me about Wes?
I saw you with him.
And now he's lying to me, and I don't know if it's because you told him to or if it's because he doesn't trust me, but I can't take it, Nate.
You're gonna tell me what's going on.
LEVI: Did you get it?
I did.
Act like an idiot again, and I'll tell Annalise and Frank who you are.
(TIRES SCREECH)
Relax. I left the gun in your house this time.
(CAR DOOR OPENS)
MICHAELA: Levi!
NATE: He came to me.
ANNALISE: Why?
He thinks you killed Rebecca.
You believe him?
Tell me why I wouldn't.
I'm not a murderer, Nate.
You know that.
I didn't kill Rebecca or Sam.
But I can't keep lying, not to you.
You deserve the truth.
MICHAELA:
What the hell is this?
Are you two gay for each other?
No!
I'll cut your balls off if you lie to me!
He's Rebecca's foster brother.
What?
Oh, my God.
No, I met him at the courthouse.
He's just some guy who's...
He's "Eggs 911."
No. No, no, no. No!
ANNALISE:
Bonnie killed Sam.
He was drunk and attacked her and tried to rape her.
And she's like my child, Nate.
I had to protect her.
What about me?
Where was my protection?
CONNOR:
Why would you keep this
a secret from us?
Because I needed to know the truth about Annalise...
And we don't deserve that, too?
The people who've helped you over and over again to...
Michaela, let me...
Do not touch me!
Hey! Keep your hands off of her.
Where's Rebecca?
You know, don't you?
I don't.
Yeah, like we can believe anything either of you two say.
Rebecca's dead.
Levi never heard from her again after the 911 text, so we think someone killed her.
Not someone.
Annalise and Frank.
No, Frank would never do that.
Of course he would.
What makes you think Rebecca's dead?
This.
I did protect you.
I knew Eve would win your case.
NATE: You hoped she'd win!
But what if she didn't, though, and I went away for this?
What were you gonna do then?
I don't know!
I hate what I did to you.
I hate it.
I hate myself.
And I know you hate me, too.
And I don't want to be this person anymore.
I want to stop making everyone's lives worse.
But I don't want to do this to you again.
I'll die if that means not hurting you again.
(SIRENS WAILING)
Oh, God.
It's happening.
Levi Wescott.
This your car?
Yeah. What's this about?
COP: Let's pop the trunk.
We'll tell you.
LEVI: No.
Fine. We got a warrant.
What the hell?
That's not mine.
Yeah, right, Heisenberg.
You're under arrest for possession of meth with the intent to distribute.
Anything you say can and will be held...
What the hell? Take it easy! against you in a court of law.
Those aren't mine!
I promise!
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you.
Help me, damn it! Help!
I'm telling you that stuff isn't mine!
It's some kind of setup!
Don't you see?
BONNIE: I know I'm the last person you want to be near, but I needed to see you.
To say I'm sorry.
For killing someone, or for using me to cover it up?
I made a mistake.
Many mistakes.
You're right.
But they were mistakes because...
(SIGHING) I'm not perfect.
But I'm a good person.
(VOICE BREAKING) It's not just me who gets hurt if you do this.
Good people don't do what you did.
They do if it's their only choice.
Please, Asher.
I love you.
I love you.
And I'm begging you not to do this.
I love you, too.
Which is why
I can't let you do this.
Secrets catch up to you, even if the cops don't.
(SIGHS) No. Asher, please, just stay here.
Just stay here and talk to me.
(SOBBING) I tried so hard, but you're right.
I can't do anything myself.
Calm down and be clear with me.
He's going to testify!
I was so stupid!
I'm always so stupid, Annalise.
So, you just need to blame it on me.
Just blame it on me.
I deserve this, but you don't deserve any of this, so just...
Just put it on me.
And I'll take it.
(GASPING)
ANNALISE: It's Sam's.
I'm not touching that thing.
Me, either.
I'll do it.
WES: No.
I should.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Where's your computer?
ASHER: What?
Look, I don't care what you're gonna say.
I already made up my mind.
And, yeah, maybe I'm some privileged white kid, but I know right from wrong.
And honestly,
I think that you're responsible for a lot of this.
If you let Bonnie call the cops and explain what happened, she wouldn't even be in this position!
Sit down.
Sit.
MICHAELA: Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
Just warn us if it's her.
You can look now, Michaela.
I just want to give you a heads up that a guy might come poking around.
Why should I trust that?
'Cause I got a plan.
If he comes sniffing around, just tell him you gave me the key to your storage locker that night.
Annalise took care of everything, but now Asher knows what we did, which means someone talked.
And it doesn't take a genius to realize it was his girlfriend.
I'd like to report a drug dealer.
(SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE)
Befriending a drug dealer, and now this?
Now, once again, wait list just drags us down the rabbit hole to hell.
Great.
You let me have sex with Eggs 911.
(ENGINE STARTS)
It's a suitcase full of cash.
Clearly it has something to do with Rebecca.
Or it has nothing to do with her.
No, Laurel, this is obviously...
Wes, stop!
Please.
Just stop.
ANNALISE:
You think you understand
the world, but you don't.
When good people do bad things, it's usually for a reason.
Meet Bonnie.
(STATIC HISSES)
MAN: Hey, there, pretty.
We're gonna play a game.
YOUNG BONNIE:
I don't want to.
MAN: Oh, you'll like this one. I promise.
What the hell is this?
MAN: It's okay. Don't worry.
Bonnie's childhood.
And that man...
MAN: It's gonna be fun.
Is her father.
MAN: The first rule is that we take off our clothes.
I'll go first, then you.
(YOUNG BONNIE SNIFFLING)
(BELT BUCKLE RATTLES)
See? Just like this.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
It's okay.
I need to pee.
I'll be right back.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
WOMAN:
Can I help you?
ASHER: Yeah.
I need to make a statement.

## S02E6

ANNALISE: Previously on
How to Get Away With Murder...
ANCHORWOMAN: Caleb and
Catherine Hapstall,
accused of murdering their parents.
You think you were framed?
Don't you?
I might be going to jail.
Very funny.
I'm not kidding.
ANNALISE:
Nia wanted to see me.
She wanted me to get her pills.
Tell me you didn't say yes.
Of course not.
Why didn't you tell me about Wes?
I saw you with him.
You're gonna tell me what's going on.
He thinks you killed Rebecca.
Frank had you dump a girl's body in this cemetery.
Okay, that's enough.
I'd like to report a drug dealer.
Levi Wescott.
This your car?
Yeah.
What's this about?
What the hell?
That's not mine.
Now, once again, wait list just drags us down the rabbit hole to hell.
I killed him, Asher.
I killed Sam.
If you testify to everything that you know,
Bonnie and me will likely go to jail.
EMILY: Full immunity on both Trotter Lake and any connection to the murder of Sam Keating.
You know Annalise is gonna come after you, too, for the David Allen case.
I did nothing wrong there.
I love you.
And I'm begging you not to do this.
Please, just stay here.
He's going to testify!
Just put it on me.
And I'll take it.
Where's your computer?
Meet Bonnie.
MAN: (ON TV)
Hey, there, pretty.
We're gonna play a game.
MAN: Blood pressure's
70 over palp.
Pulse is thready.
Don't touch the body.
We got a body.
(MONITOR BEEPING)
Is she okay?
Tell me! Is she gonna be okay?
WOMAN: We're taking her to surgery.
Why? What does that mean?
Sir, please, get out of the way.
She can't die.
Get him out of here.
Sir, they're doing everything they can.
(BEEPING)
WOMAN: She's arresting.
MAN: Sir.
Starting CPR. Push one of epi.
FRANK: What's wrong?
MAN: Sir, just let them do their job.
FRANK:
Tell me what's happening!
Still no activity.
FRANK:
Please, don't let her die!
MAN:
Just let them do their job.
WOMAN: Push one more of epi.
Don't let her die!
(SIREN WAILING)
(CAR ALARM CHIRPS)
CATHERINE:
We are innocent.
(ALARM BLARING)
(MOANS)
(ALARM STOPS)
Sorry. I'm sorry.
That gave me a heart attack.
I thought that was me.
You know you become less and less sexy with every new compliment you give yourself?
I don't believe that.
Shower?
Uh...
You go.
I don't think my legs work yet.
(WATER RUNNING)
WES:
It's a suitcase
full of cash.
Clearly it has something to do with Rebecca.
Or it has nothing to do with her.
FRANK: Hey.
Sure you don't want to hop in?
Save water.
Only 'cause I care about the environment.
What is this?
Oh, it's a list of bad things you could've done.
I know you said you couldn't tell me, which I totally...
Terrorism?
See?
It'll be easy.
We can strike that, right?
I'm not a terrorist, Oli.
Great. Let's cross off number two, pedophilia.
Look, what I did wasn't actually that bad.
You said you could go to jail for it.
Which was an exaggeration.
Look, let's throw this away and make use of the 10 minutes I have...
Hey.
Before I have to go to work.
(OLIVER CHUCKLES)
This is very manipulative of you.
This is very manipulative of me.
Ah! (CHUCKLES)
NATE: You've reached
Nate Lahey. Leave a message.
(BEEPS)
Where are you?
Please, call me back.
Is that your bestie Levi?
How's jail treating him?
I can take crap from Connor and Michaela, fine, but you know I'm not crazy.
No. You've just made me crazy.
I snooped through
Frank's stuff this morning.
You found something?
No.
And I won't because there's nothing to find.
Then what's with the suitcase?
Huh, we were right.
They're obsessing about the suitcase.
Fine, I'll stop, if one of you can explain why Frank would have that much cash.
Maybe he has a gambling problem or distrusts banks.
Or is saving it to hire a hit man to kill Wes for letting me sleep with a drug dealer.
Okay, can we all stop this, please?
Forget about the suitcase and Rebecca and Levi before Annalise finds out we've all gone bananas again.
Wes?
None of this makes sense.
Did your mother drop you on your head as a baby?
Because we get it.
You're sad your little girlfriend flaked out on you.
You mean got killed.
MICHAELA: No.
That's the tall tale your little weenie brain made up, so do whatever you need to do to silence the lambs or I will serial kill you.
Why aren't we in our seats?
The United States v. Mahoney.
Mr. Millstone.
Tell me the verdict.
MAN: (ON TV)
I'll go first, then you.
See? Just like this.
(BONNIE CRYING)
Why the hell do you have that?
Does it matter?
How do you think
Bonnie felt when Sam came at her that night, when he put his hands on her?
You think she had a choice in how she reacted?
No.
But I said I'd testify.
I know.
But the good part is that you still have time to change your mind.
I'll protect you, Asher.
But we need to protect Bonnie, too.
That's what we do for people that we love.
Right?
Now forget you saw this.
Of course.
Good.
There's something else, though.
Sinclair knows about this thing I did.
It's bad.
Tell me everything.
I'll fix it.
There was no verdict in the U.S. v. Mahoney.
Due to the victim's concerns about suffering additional emotional harm, he didn't testify and the judge had no choice but to dismiss the case.
What legal option did the prosecutor exercise in allowing the victim's request not to testify?
Discretion.
(DOOR CLOSES)
It doesn't make sense.
I know.
I was shocked, too.
But he came to me before class and he said he changed his mind.
So, something you said clearly worked.
Well, his dad's involved, though, and Sinclair.
How do we know he's not secretly cooperating with them?
This is my fault.
You're so used to me doubting you that you can't see when you've done something right.
But that's exactly what you've done here.
You fixed this, and it makes sense.
He loves you.
Maybe you can't see it, but I can.
Sorry I had to go all
Jason Bourne on you guys, but, uh, your heads would literally kerplode if you knew about all the crap going on in this house.
(CHUCKLES)
Really? You can't tell us anything?
No, not a peep.
Good. I don't want to know anything that could get me into trouble.
Seriously, don't tell us anything.
I mean, I won't.
You know, A.K. really wants to keep this genie in a bottle, so...
It's that intense.
(CHUCKLES)
I hear I owe you a fist bump for keeping our mole quiet.
What'd you do?
Promise a year's worth of lap dances?
Pretty much.
(CHUCKLES)
You need something?
No.
FRANK: When are you finally gonna talk to him?
ANNALISE: I don't know.
Sooner the better, I say.
The suitcase distracted him, but he's a dog with a bone about Rebecca.
ANNALISE:
Don't you think I know that?
I'll handle him the way I always do.
Right now, I have to go handle a bitch.
Ms. Keating, did we have an appointment?
I thought your schedule would be clear now that your star witness has abandoned you.
Mr. Millstone and I still have to talk about that.
No, you don't.
He sent me on his behalf.
I admire your ambition.
You see an opportunity to grab headlines to make the big boys upstairs notice you, but you're making a rookie mistake.
Of course you're gonna say that.
It's not my opinion.
It's the law.
What you've done to Mr. Millstone amounts to witness tampering and intimidation.
I make one phone call, and the press will make you out to be an overzealous, law-breaking prosecutor desperate to take me down.
Why? Beats me.
But the reporters will come up with theories.
Jealousy, egomania, racism.
EMILY: Fine.
I'll lay off Mr. Millstone, but only because we still have the
Hapstall case together.
I look forward to destroying you in court.
ANNALISE: I know I talk a lot about winning.
And yes, a part of it is my pride.
But it's also about our clients.
Now, Catherine and Caleb have placed their lives in our hands.
Do I think they're guilty?
I have no clue.
But I do know what it feels like to be misunderstood, to have people expect the worst from you.
And it doesn't feel good.
(PHONE RINGING)
Now, we owe Catherine and Caleb our best, and that means going back to the basics.
Who remembers step two?
Find a new suspect.
Yes.
Annalise, it's Professor Hartford.
Tell her I'll call her back.
From the start,
Catherine and Caleb have said that they were framed.
Now, we need to find out who they think did that.
Go to the mansion...
She says it's urgent.
Urgent, my ass.
Tell her I don't want to go to her stupid anniversary party.
Our clients are rich.
Rich people usually have enemies.
We need to look at family members, business partners...
She says it's an emergency.
Oh, for God's sakes.
This better be good, Jill.
Slow down.
JILL: He came at me with a bottle yelling.
I didn't know what to do, so I grabbed it out of his hand and...
Oh, my God, Annalise.
What'd you do?
I killed Steven.
Tell me exactly what happened.
JILL: He was out all night.
He came home slurring, screaming at me.
I tried to leave for class, but he grabbed me.
He wouldn't let go.
Shouldn't I call the police?
In a second.
Was it the first time he came at you?
No.
Was he abusive?
Jill, we don't have any time for secrets.
Sometimes when he'd drink, he'd get angry.
I should've left him a long time ago, I know.
Are there any signs of a struggle?
What do you mean?
Well, you're telling me it's self-defense, that he attacked you.
Are there any signs of that?
He, uh, knocked over a chair and, um, there's some stuff on the coffee table.
Did he hit you, leave any marks on your body?
There's some scratches on my arm.
ANNALISE: All right.
I want you to
hang up, call 911, and don't talk to the police till I get there.
Not a word, okay?
JILL: Okay.
Please hurry.
Gettin' your vitamin C game on?
(CHUCKLES)
Why aren't you on your way to the Hapstalls?
Oh, you didn't hear?
Caleb shot Catherine, but not before she shot him, and now they're both dead.
I can't thank you enough for...
I know this is weird.
You go.
No, you.
Just say something, Asher.
I'm sorry for what happened to you.
What Sam did.
It's not right.
It's not okay.
I just wish there was something I could say.
(CHUCKLES)
You just did.
And you're protecting me.
I should be the one thanking you.
How's your father?
Uh, I don't know.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm just gonna ignore his calls till he chills.
Annalise can handle this, right?
Annalise takes care of everything.
(SIGHS)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
DETECTIVE: Annalise.
Surprised you didn't get here before me.
ANNALISE:
I got here just in time to see your boys contaminating the crime scene.
Let's make note of this officer here not wearing any gloves.
We'll be using that in court.
So you agree we're going to trial on this one.
If you're dumb enough to charge her.
Test his blood.
See how drunk he was when he attacked her.
You didn't talk to anyone, did you?
No, no.
I can't believe I did this.
No, you did not do this.
He did this the first time he attacked you, you hear me?
(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(SIGHS)
MICHAELA: Well, we obviously
know who I think our
number-one suspect is.
The racist. Aunt Helena.
She was next in line to get the money if you two went to jail.
She's dead now.
Her money has to go to someone, though, right?
An ex-husband, a boyfriend.
A girlfriend.
Old ladies can like vag, too.
Our aunt willed all her money to a charity based in Africa.
Hmm, the irony.
LAUREL:
What about Miss Guthrie?
She planted the sibcest photo of you two, had access to the house.
Her sister told the police she was home all night.
Why aren't we considering your real parents?
Your sperm and egg parents, not them.
Oh, my God.
Those are our real parents.
You know what I mean.
We're not looking into our birth parents.
Why not?
A jury might buy that they resented your adopted parents' ability to give you what they couldn't.
So they murdered them in cold blood?
That makes no sense.
It does if the birth parents knew how much
Catherine and Caleb would inherit.
Okay, no, we are not vilifying the people who were brave enough to put their biological kids' needs before their own, thus ensuring them a safe and loving home.
Exactly.
So, please tell us those aren't the only potential suspects you have.
Ronald Freestone.
Your dad's ex-business partner who was ousted from the board.
She thinks he was at Risque Business all night.
The strip club?
I'll see who can put him there.
Bonnie, when Jill called us, did she call us from her cell phone?
No, home.
He knocked over a chair and, um, there's some stuff on the coffee table.
BONNIE: Annalise, is everything okay?
There's some scratches on my arm.
She used what I told her.
What?
Stay by the phone.
ANNALISE: Time to get honest.
There was no struggle.
You just made it look like one after our call.
I can explain.
Not here.
Question for you,
Mrs. Hartford.
Who is this?
(JILL SCOFFS)
Well, that's me.
Was me. Why?
We've said all we're gonna say at this point, Detective.
Now I know your client's lying.
I haven't lied about anything.
Don't engage.
You lied to your husband about what you are.
How dare you.
You're out of line,
Detective.
My husband attacked me.
Only 'cause he finally found out what you hid from him.
Bastard.
Enough.
So you killed him.
No, I killed him because he was going to kill me first.
Don't you dare use who I am against me or you'll be next.
You swear Steven knew.
Oh, my God.
Listen, you heard the detective.
They want to make this into a story they can understand.
That story's played out.
I know.
I told Steven on our third date.
Can anyone vouch that Steven knew?
Annalise.
I'm not asking for myself.
I'm asking so I can defend you.
Yes. There's people that can vouch for it.
What they didn't know is that he was beating me, because I covered up for him again and again.
I just couldn't take it anymore.
Why stage the crime scene?
I exaggerated it.
Why?
Because I knew no one would believe me.
ANNALISE:
How do you know?
Because I do.
No, you don't, and now there's a chance that they'll find out.
CeCe McDonald.
She killed a man...
For attacking her because she was trans.
It was self-defense, but she had to take the deal and she ended up in a men's prison because she knew no one would believe her.
I needed them to believe me.
Okay.
Okay what?
Let's teach these bastards a lesson.
Where have you been?
Doesn't matter.
It does.
Frank used his storage locker the night Rebecca disappeared.
I went inside and found all this cash in a suitcase.
Great.
Tell your friend.
What's his name?
He's in jail for dealing,
but I think Annalise set him up.
Are you hearing what I'm saying?
No.
And I'm done with anything having to do with Annalise.
Stop calling me.
ASHER: What about the staff?
You know, my family
used to have this one sticky-fingered maid, Paulette.
Her kid would show up wearing my T-shirts.
That is an ass that you could rest a drink on.
Hey. You're a single lady again.
You could hit that.
The last time I "hit that" with a guy you suggested, he turned out to have three drug arrest warrants on him.
Levi?
MICHAELA: Yeah.
Called the police station this morning.
Good news is they're shipping his ass back to Georgia, so he can rot in jail there.
CONNOR: You've had a little bad luck in the dating department, but Caleb is innocent, maybe, which makes him totally porkable.
He's not innocent.
How do you know?
If you're charged with a murder you didn't commit, you'd want to blame anyone but yourself, even your birth parents.
We're considering the birth parents again?
No.
LAUREL: Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
It's recording.
Whose is that?
It's Catherine's.
She's recording us?
Delete it.
She'll know.
CONNOR: Well, it's better than letting her hear us say they're killers.
It's got a pass code.
It's 4713.
And you don't get to be mad
I recorded you.
You lied to me, as did you, so I figured we might as well know what our lawyers were saying about us for once.
I don't know what's more idiotic.
Bad-mouthing our clients in their own home or getting caught doing it.
I'd say the latter.
I'll talk to Caleb, explain...
He just called.
He doesn't want any of you near this case.
But not me, right?
You know, at least tell me you've made some headway on the suspect front.
You're all garbage.
You mean all them, right?
Not me?
I'm still good, right?
Find everyone who knew Jill and Steve and see if anyone witnessed the abuse.
We believe her?
(SCOFFS)
For some reason, I do, yes.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Got some bad news, Annalise.
Oh, no.
No more bad news.
For real?
What is it, Frank?
Nate's wife's dead.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Nate?
It's Annalise.
I just heard, and...
I made you a peach cobbler.
I'll just leave it right here.
Uncle Silas.
Looks like a serial killer.
His credit cards show he was in Brazil during the murders.
The family lawyer.
Was at a museum gala that night.
Why don't we at least find out who the birth parents are?
No respectable adoption agency is just gonna hand over that information to us.
Then Wes can go and pretend he's Caleb.
I can play his wife.
We're having a baby and I need your medical history...
You need an ID.
Or a court order.
Then Oliver can just hack into the agency's records.
Perfect.
I'll call him now.
No! Our client specifically said not to go down this road.
Is this about your crush on Caleb?
You are the one who has a crush on Caleb.
I simply think it's inappropriate to characterize birth parents as murderers.
Okay, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
I'm adopted, and no, we're not talking about it, but yes, it means I have personal feelings about this issue, which I would consider putting aside if I didn't know that this was just
Wes and his crazy.
How is this about me?
Because everything wrong about our lives is about you.
You continue to be paranoid and make us all paranoid.
I'm not the one who killed Rebecca.
CONNOR:
We don't know that anyone killed her.
No one killed Rebecca.
Then explain why
Frank called Bruno the night she went missing.
Do you not realize this is just Annalise...
Get up.
What? Why?
Let's go ask Frank if he killed Rebecca.
No.
Are you stupid?
LAUREL:
I'm over all the secrets.
We should know better at this point.
So let's just get an answer once and for all.
Spit it out.
You're gonna want to lie to us, but I'm warning you we know a lot more...
Wes stole the key to the storage locker because this guy Bruno told him you went there the night Rebecca disappeared.
So we unlocked it to see if her dead body was in there, but we just found cash.
I know.
You do?
Guy waves a gun in my buddy's face, you don't think I get a call?
LAUREL: So?
Is Rebecca dead?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Then explain the cash.
Why'd you put it in the storage locker the same exact night?
It's hush money for Rebecca.
So she'd not rat out you dummies for tying her up.
She's an idiot for not surfacing by now.
Would've made for a nice payday.
Any more questions?
'Cause I like that we're all being honest with each other for once.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Hi.
Um, I'm looking for
Bonnie Winterbottom.
I'd just started working for
Professor Hartford, as her TA.
And I forgot to put her midterms in her bag.
When I got to her apartment,
I saw her and Steven in her car out front.
I started to approach, but I stopped because...
She saw Steven strike you in the face two times, three times, maybe more.
Melissa doesn't recall because she was afraid and ran and never said a word to anyone because it never happened.
You asked a student to lie for you.
Did you ever suspect it?
That he was beating me senseless after every one of our dinner parties?
When I was too sick to attend the Women Leaders Luncheon
I begged you for six months to help me host?
Of course not.
Because that's how good
I was at hiding it.
Don't be mad at me.
I am mad.
And I'm sorry for that.
Not because you lied to me.
But because I didn't think of this idea myself.
(EXHALES)
Melissa Greenwell saw Steven Hartford beating my client and is willing to testify to that in open court.
You tracked down one witness and expect us to drop the charges in a murder investigation?
You mean a hate crime investigation.
How is this a hate crime?
How is it not?
A woman is abused by her husband and further persecuted by an insensitive, transphobic detective, and now a like-minded
DA's office?
Drop the charges before it gets ugly.
I wish I could, Annalise.
But Mrs. Hartford's phone record shows a call between you and her before she called 911.
There's no crime in calling your lawyer before the police.
Your conversation lasted one minute, 42 seconds.
She was upset.
Or you needed all that time to coach her on how to make the crime scene look like a textbook self-defense case.
So, maybe I should be working up charges on the both of you.
Your client for the first degree, and you for accessory after the fact.
They're bluffing.
No way they have enough to charge you.
He has phone calls and my reputation.
He doesn't need much else.
Annalise.
Not now, Asher.
It's important.
Give us a minute.
A reporter just called my cell, said she had questions about Tiffany.
Did she say anything else, give any details?
No.
(EXHALES) That's good.
How is that good?
Sinclair leaked this.
She leaked a name to scare you.
It means nothing.
But you said you'd handle her.
I did. She's just too stupid to know it.
I thought you were gonna fix this.
Everything.
Because I have my dad to deal with and I have to talk to him at some point, even though I have no idea what to say.
And he's a judge, you know.
He can find ways to take you down if he wants to.
The dude is persistent.
I know he hates you.
He'll make it his business...
Get me all the dirt we have on Judge Millstone, Bonnie.
That means every file in the David Allen case.
Frank, find any evidence of malfeasance we can use against him.
On it.
Annalise, you promised Asher you wouldn't do this.
My father's name stays out of it, agreed or not.
No one can know the role he played in
David's conviction.
Agreed.
That was before.
It's his father.
Your boyfriend has got to grow up sometime.
God knows everyone else in the house has.
Now it's his turn.
ASHER: So, is A.K. out handling my stuff?
I think so.
You think so because you can't tell me what you actually know?
She's on it, Asher.
ANNALISE:
Do you like your job?
I think you do.
I just don't think you love it.
Is this a therapy session now?
ANNALISE:
Career counseling.
You're gonna drop the charges against Jill Hartford on the grounds of self-defense, and you're gonna see to it that Emily Sinclair ends her witch hunt into me and my staff.
Wait, now I'm doing you two favors?
Or as I prefer to call it, two birds, one Millstone.
Millstone?
Federal Judge Millstone.
There's enough evidence in there to charge him with multiple counts of corruption.
And just like that, you're the ballsy prosecutor running for state's attorney on an anti-corruption ticket.
I'd vote for you.
You just need to free my client.
How'd you do it?
It doesn't matter.
The DA's office believes you.
It's nothing but a case of self-defense.
So, I'm free to go?
You're free to go.
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)
(SIGHS)
Don't you dare blame yourself.
One wrong blow, and it might've been him calling me yesterday, instead of you.
I don't blame myself.
(SIGHS)
A good person would cry for him right now, grieve.
But I can't.
(CHUCKLES)
I let him win for far too long.
And I believed him when he said he was the only one who could ever love me.
I'm so glad he's dead, Annalise.
I'm glad Sam's dead, too.
He wasn't the man everyone thought he was, either.
But I stayed.
Who the hell knows why?
It's okay.
You're free.
You finally get to be the woman you really are.
(SIGHS)
For the record, I hate this.
We heard you.
Now let my boyfriend hack the orphanage.
It's an adoption agency, not an orphanage.
There's a difference.
Whoa, this is weird.
Uh, I ran a password attack on their system using a brute force algorithm called Snake...
Less nerd, more information.
Here.
This file lists an adoption under the last name Hapstall.
Catherine or Caleb?
Neither.
It's under Helena Hapstall.
When the police came the next morning,
I knew they'd done it.
MICHAELA: The racist.
She's the birth mother.
What? Of who?
A baby boy.
ANNALISE: Your aunt's charity was founded
the same year she had a child, and that charity was linked to a bank account in the Caymans, which means she used it to support the child who had everything to gain from the murders of your parents and his mother.
He just needed to get rid of you two.
So, a cousin we didn't know existed framed us?
It gives us a third suspect.
And the best part...
Juries love a secret baby.
How do we find him?
We're looking right now.
And just so you know, as much as I like to claim all good ideas as my own, it was these fools who found this out.
It was the least they could do for you.
Um, Caleb, wait.
I just...
I wanted to say sorry.
That recording was inappropriate.
You mean the part about me being guilty or the part about my butt?
Oh. I'm so sorry.
It's fine.
Just... Is it true?
Your boyfriend's in jail, which means you're single now?
Uh, it's a long story.
Right.
Maybe I'll get to hear about it sometime.
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
ANNALISE: Nate?
(SIGHS)
(DOOR OPENS)
More cobbler?
You think this is what I need right now?
I'll go.
No.
You want to hear me say it.
That I did it.
I know that's what she wanted.
Don't tell me what my wife wanted!
Sorry.
I couldn't not come.
Because you know what you took from me.
She needed me.
The whole time I was in jail, in court, but I wasn't there
'cause you stole that from us.
The only time we had left together, you stole that.
So no cobbler or apologies could fix it.
Right.
I would hate me, too.
I don't hate you.
I just don't care about you.
I gave Nia those pills because I loved her.
And I laid next to her in that bed, held her as she fell asleep, so close that
I could feel when she took her last breath.
No one's ever gonna love you that way.
Leave.
Leave!
(DOOR CLOSES)
Wes.
LAUREL:
Where are we going?
You'll know soon enough.
See, that just makes me more suspicious.
Like, are you showing me your safe house or just the spot where you buried Rebecca?
Okay.
It's one thing for
Wes to think I'm capable of killing a girl.
But it's not cool when it comes from you.
I'm sorry.
Are you saying I hurt your feelings?
Pretty much.
And maybe that's my fault.
The less I tell you, the more you think I'm all bad, but that's why we're here, so you can finally meet the real me.
Just promise you won't make fun of him.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Ma! We're here!
MRS. DELFINO:
Ah, finally.
Well, she's showing way less cleavage than the last two, so we're off to a good start.
What's your name?
Laurel.
Uh, everyone, this is Frank's new friend Lauren.
Laurel.
MRS. DELFINO:
Yeah, this is Dino, Lou,
Joey, Teresa,
Angie, Brandi, Danny, and some other guy who's always eating my food.
(LAUGHS)
Oh! Who the hell is this?
Laurel. Hi.
The smart girl.
I know, I know.
But you know what, you can't be too smart if you're dating this one here.
Dad.
You hungry?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, you're hungry.
Come on. Come on in.
You're gonna sit right next to me.
Let's go. Come on.
Right here.
You know, my wife, she's not that good a cook, but we know how to pour the booze.
Munch, munch.
Everybody.
A salute!
MRS. DELFINO: A salute!
MR. DELFINO:
Get the bread. Come on.
Give her the bread.
Nate's wife died last night.
(KEYS JINGLE)
(DOOR CLOSES)
We have to finally talk, Wes.
You mean you do.
'Cause you know everything now. Right?
From Frank, or has Nate just been telling you all along?
I didn't kill Rebecca.
I know. That's what you want me to believe.
Why else would you have me find that suitcase?
She ran away.
That's all I know.
You know more than that.
So just tell me.
Is she dead?
I don't know where she is.
I don't believe you.
And I understand that.
It's because of your mother.
I wish I could be the dad you wanted.
But I can't.
I know this doesn't make sense to you, but there's people in that house, one especially, they don't deserve this.
Just think if it were Mom.
You would do anything you could to protect her, right?
Not if it meant selling out my own father.
What?
Don't play dumb.
I'm not testifying.
How is that...
Emily Sinclair got the DA to open an investigation on me.
Every case in my career, starting with David Allen.
There you go.
Finally putting two and two together.
We're done, Ash.
Dad.
Have a nice life.
BONNIE: Why am I here?
EMILY: So I can say congratulations.
Your boss shut down my investigation.
What else?
Tell Annalise
I'm done. She won.
But girl-to-girl,
I thought you should know the real about your boyfriend.
Here.
In case he hasn't told you about Tiffany Howard.
I'm not playing this game with you.
You sure?
You lost.
Be an adult and move on.
You're gonna regret not reading this.
You're wrong.
Tiffany was gang raped.
Your mother killed herself.
How do you know that?
It's my job to know these things.
About all of you.
She abandoned you and...
It's not something that a 12-year-old boy gets over.
Stop.
Now you can't trust anyone anymore.
Definitely not a woman.
Your mother leaves, now Rebecca.
So I understand why you can't trust me.
So, I did something bad, too.
It's not terrorism or pedophilia bad, but something that might put me in jail with you when you're finally caught for whatever bad thing you did.
What did you do?
I kept searching for the secret baby even though you told me not to.
What?
His name's Philip Jessup.
A 26-year-old white male who lives two miles away from the Hapstall mansion...
Oli!
It gets worse. Uh...
I hacked into his computer.
Are you insane?
This guy is probably the killer.
I know.
It's scary, right?
But, like, in a fun way.
No, not in a fun way.
He could be a serial killer
or a cannibal or...
Okay, Annalise
will be happy
that we found him.
I don't care
about making
Annalise happy.
I care about making sure you don't get in trouble
for all this crap that we do.
OLIVER:
No one's gonna know.
This is my fault.
I shouldn't have involved you.
Just turn it off, okay?
Just make it stop.
This isn't about my mother.
It is.
You won't trust...
You're nothing like her!
She gave up everything for me.
Her entire life to bring me to the States.
And it killed her.
You never did anything like that for anyone.
Instead, you just lie...
I haven't lied to you about...
How do you expect me to believe that?
It's the truth.
Look at me, Wes! Look at me!
Get off me! Don't touch me!
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay.
Okay.
(EXHALES)
Rebecca ran away.
That's all I know.
How are the Delfinos?
Hey, you tell Brandi I say hi?
She's not into you.
Damn.
Maybe I should just date girls like this instead.
Won't complain or order the most expensive thing on the menu.
Don't be gross.
And the worst part about this is that it's destroying us.
But I'm here for you,
Wes, all right?
I'm never leaving you.
You have to stop keeping secrets from me then.
You're right.
No more secrets.
We've looked all over for her, Wes.
Everywhere.
I can't find her.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
(WES SNIFFS)
Tell me you've taken care of it.
The right way, this time.
FRANK: In the process.
(SIGHS) Don't worry.
Good.
(GRUNTS)
REBECCA: No, no.
No, no. Listen.
Listen to me.
You don't have to do this.
I'll be good. I'll be so good.
(REBECCA GASPING)
(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)
(DOG PANTING)
What do you got, boy?
(BARKING)
K-22 to Command.
I have subject located.
Start rescue team to my location.
100 yards northeast of my entry point.
(GASPS)
Command, subject is conscious. I repeat, subject is conscious.

## S02E7

ANNALISE: Previously on
How To Get Away With Murder...
I want you to kill me.
I'm not the woman you think I am.
I gave Nia those pills because I loved her.
ANNALISE: I framed him.
Because you killed Sam?
Because I'm protecting the person who did.
So, I did something bad.
What did you do?
I kept searching for the secret baby even though you told me not to.
His name's Philip Jessup.
Emily Sinclair got the D.A. to open an investigation on me.
We're done, Ash.
EMILY: Girl-to-girl,
I thought you should know the real about your boyfriend.
In case he hasn't told you about
Tiffany Howard.
Tiffany was gang raped.
MICHAELA: Connor!
If you don't want to come, then don't.
Okay, but just think for a second.
No more excuses.
We know better this time.
(DOOR OPENS)
Wait.
(DOOR CLOSES)
What do we do?
Stop them.
(SNIFFS)
Relax. I left the gun in your house this time.
ANNALISE:
Have some balls, Mr. Lecht.
Your client's going down for murder unless you could find someone else to pin it on.
For our case, it's Mother Teresa.
So, how are you gonna turn her into a killer?
Well, normally, you'd start by mining the suspect's personality traits.
Such as?
Uh... (CHUCKLES)
I don't know.
She's kind of the most selfless person who ever lived.
ANNALISE: Well, use that.
She has an inflated sense of self-worth, thinks she's God.
What else?
Is she an egomaniac, a secret abuser of children, a...
LAUREL: Sad loner.
Philip only has four friends on his profile, and they're all from his gaming community, and look...
He's alone in almost all his pictures, no family, friends...
May be a loner, but he's got some bomb-ass game controllers.
We can argue that he's got antisocial personality disorder, that he's prone to violence, homicidal tendencies...
Charity work, uh...
Most of it focused on hospice care, so...
I don't know how that could tie into her motive.
I do. Maybe she killed for love or...
CONNOR: Money.
Philip gets minimum wage at his grocery store job, explaining why he'd be after the Hapstall fortune.
We need an emotional motive for the jury, can't just be financial.
He's got white man's rage.
Here he is, poor and lonely, while two minorities live the wealthy life his blood entitles him to.
ANNALISE: Did Mother Teresa have the means to commit this murder?
Well, the victim was a small child, and...
Since Mother Teresa often worked with poor children...
"Poor, vulnerable children."
Philip lives within two miles of the Hapstall mansion.
We just have to prove he was in town the night of the murders.
You haven't figured that out yet?
We're working on it.
ANNALISE: Work faster.
Go through discovery.
Study the crime scene.
Get me proof that
Philip is a killer so I can spring it on Sinclair before the trial.
What about Catherine and Caleb?
Uh, should we tell them that we found him?
So they can confront him and do something stupid?
No. We say nothing until we know more.
Which means no pillow talk with your boyfriend.
WOMAN: (OVER PA)
Dr. Patterson, dial 2131.
Dr. Patterson, 2131.
NURSE: There's this, too.
She made it for your birthday and asked me to hide it.
No, my wife did not make this.
She did.
Why doesn't it look like crap?
(CHUCKLES)
Well, I might've cleaned up the ends just a little bit.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
WOMAN: Are you Nate Lahey?
Yeah.
What do you need?
You've been served.
Sinclair's saying
Nia's death was foul play.
She wants the judge to let her test
Nia's blood.
Nia was cremated.
They took blood samples after she died for some clinical trial.
So, those pills I got you...
I didn't give them to Nate.
You sure?
I got to know if I'm gonna protect us here.
(SCOFFS) If you want to protect us, kill Emily Sinclair.
(LOCK DISENGAGES)
I was wondering when you'd show up.
Did the two of you kill her together?
Ha, great. So now I'm gonna have to defend both of you.
I did it.
On my own.
She called me first, asked me for pills.
Of course she did, because who doesn't ask their husband's mistress to off her?
Okay, that, uh...
I'm very sorry for your loss,
Nate. I am.
But what you did...
You knew Sinclair wanted to take you down.
She wanted to take me down, not him.
I'll fix it...
Or try.
Nia was stage four?
For over a year.
EVE: That's our answer then.
Convince the judge
Nia died of natural causes and that Sinclair has some vendetta against the two of you.
But you are not allowed anywhere near this.
The fact that there's been any contact between the two of you since I left is crazy.
You both know it, so don't make me say it again.
We have to prep.
Don't worry. I got this.
ASHER: Hey, you didn't call me back last night.
I fell asleep early.
Okay, but this thing with my dad has gotten worse.
They've removed him from the bench until the investigation's over.
Which is the least he deserves, don't you think?
I guess, but he's blaming me. (CHUCKLES)
And you? Aren't you blaming you?
For what?
What you and your friends did at Trotter Lake.
MICHAELA:
What's Trotter Lake?
It's rude to eavesdrop.
ASHER: Hey, wait. Bonnie.
I'm meeting Annalise at court.
I know. Just...
Look, who told you?
I just confront you with the fact that you and your friends gang-raped a girl, and your response is who told me?
No, I wasn't a part of that.
It was my party, but I was downstairs.
They were upstairs...
You could've stopped them.
I was drunk.
What an original excuse.
(DOOR SLAMS)
Your client hacked into the Tidwells' cellphones, then stole private texts of a sexual nature sent between a husband and his wife.
Allegedly stole.
He then printed and distributed them to every member of their church congregation.
Allegedly.
You have no proof my client did this.
Right. There's just proof he did this.
Your client might've gotten away with harassing Sharon's last two husbands, but this time he went too far, to the point where
Marco Tidwell felt his only escape was to do a swan-dive off the 15th floor of the Eisenworth building.
No one can make someone commit suicide.
I disagree.
Then let's go to trial.
It starts in a few hours.
NELSON: Five years.
ANNALISE: Six months, two years probation.
ATTORNEY: Four years minimum security.
Prussian blue.
You wore that same color the first night of our honeymoon.
Two years or we walk.
Did you wear that for me?
ANNALISE:
What do you say?
Do we have a deal?
(CHUCKLES)
You did, didn't you?
Do not make the deal.
Sharon. Honey.
You're delusional, Dale.
And now you've killed the love of my life, so enough.
We're going to trial.
That woman doesn't love you, you hear me?
Not one ounce.
Well, that's where we disagree.
Lunch?
Your trial is in four hours.
We don't have time to eat.
See if the judge will grant us a continuance.
I'll go now.
(SIGHS)
Then tell Bixby to take the assault, or it's six to eight.
I'll call you back.
Nate lost his wife after watching her suffer for years.
Or he killed her so he could be with you.
Do I need to talk to your boss again?
I was told to back off of you, not Mr. Lahey.
It's just a simple blood test.
If he has nothing to hide, why object?
You're messing with the wrong bitch.
Is that a threat?
I guess you'll see.
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
You know, there are people on the other side of this door.
I thought getting caught was the fun part.
Are you getting soft on me?
No.
Oh, neither are you.
I thought you had your trial.
That's why I'm here, to get help.
(DOOR CLOSES)
I take it that all this playtime means that you've already found evidence to convict Philip.
Working on it.
Miss Castillo with me.
(DOOR OPENS)
So, we need to prove that our client had nothing to do with that man's suicide, that he jumped off the building for some other reason.
Our client jumped off a building?
The victim, Marco Tidwell.
Our client, Dale, he stalked Marco.
So find out what he knows about him.
What... What Dale knows or what Marco knows?
My God. Mr. Gibbins, help Miss Castillo figure out my case.
LAUREL: No,
I can do it. You just...
And I'd rather work on the Hapstalls.
I'm sure Laurel's got it.
You think this is a democracy?
You go where I tell you to go.
Should I help, too?
See if Bonnie needs anything?
Great.
Now you got two men holding your hand.
Wow. Way to set feminism back a few steps.
Me? It's her.
Uh-huh.
If I were Marco,
I would've killed myself, too.
He only made
$85,000 a year, you know?
That's actually a lot of money.
No, bro, it's not, but it's cute you think that.
How do you know how much Marco made?
I went through his tax returns.
And you claim you're not a stalker.
I was looking out for Sharon.
She has expensive taste.
I wanted to make sure her new husband would be able to provide what she deserves.
What else did you find out about him?
Anything that'd make him commit suicide?
He went to church.
Religious people are less likely to commit suicide.
Okay, what if he went to church three nights a week?
Who does that unless they're depressed?
(LAUGHS) You have a really strange way of looking at the world.
Wait. He went to church at night?
LAUREL:
Marco was an alcoholic.
He wasn't going to church.
He was going to AA meetings, which proves he had substance-abuse issues that we could argue led to suicide.
BONNIE: The anonymity of AA meetings is protected under the law.
LAUREL: Then let's ask
Sharon on the stand.
She's not gonna admit her husband was a drunk if it helps Dale's case.
She will if we make her.
ANNALISE:
Was your husband an alcoholic?
They told me you would try and blame the victim.
JUDGE: Answer the question,
Mrs. Tidwell.
No, my husband was not an alcoholic.
So why else would he go to St. Colette's Church three times a week for
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings?
He went to church to worship.
He was a godly man.
Mrs. Tidwell, would you be surprised to know that we have dozens of security-camera photos of Marco attending this AA meeting?
Wait. We have photos?
She's bluffing, you idiot.
(STAMMERS)
I don't know. I...
I... I might recall him saying that he was interested in going.
So you lied.
You knew he was an alcoholic.
No.
Because alcoholics are three times more likely to suffer from clinical depression than the general public.
Marco was not depressed.
Your Honor, where is the medical evidence?
And that's why he killed himself.
It wasn't because of my client.
It was because he was a drunk who couldn't stand his life with you any longer.
If Ms. Keating continues to treat my witness with such disrespect...
Relax. Mrs. Tidwell gave me everything
I need to know.
No further questions.
(SPECTATORS MURMURING)
Your next witness,
Mr. Nelson?
I'd like to call the victim,
Marco Tidwell, to the stand.
ANNALISE: Objection.
Mr. Tidwell's posthumous testimony wasn't on the evidence list.
Only because I wanted to spare Mrs. Tidwell the undue pains of hearing her husband's 911 call, but since Ms. Keating has dragged us into the muck,
I have no other choice.
This is hearsay, Your Honor.
It's a dying declaration,
Ms. Keating.
Let's just hear it.
OPERATOR: (OVER SPEAKERS)
911. What's your emergency?
MARCO: This is Marco Tidwell.
And I'm going to kill myself.
OPERATOR:
Where are you, Marco?
MARCO: The roof of the Eisenworth building.
OPERATOR: Marco, listen...
MARCO: I'm calling so that bastard hears this.
He needs to know he did this.
OPERATOR:
Marco, I understand
how painful this is.
MARCO:
(VOICE BREAKING) Goodbye.
OPERATOR: Marco? Marco?
(WIND RUSHING)
Marco, are you there? Marco?
(THUDS)
(DIAL TONE RINGS)
Ouch.
(BUTTON CLICKS)
We switch to an insanity defense.
Or have Dale ruled unfit to stand trial.
We'll look desperate to the jury.
WES: Reapproach the prosecutor about a deal?
ANNALISE: That's called losing.
We don't do that.
Ms. Castillo, any ideas?
Or are you just gonna let the men think of them for you?
Uh...
Why do I even bother asking?
Find me something
I can use in court.
(PHONE RINGING)
Look. Caleb's calling.
Now, why does Caleb have your number?
I gave it to him when I was prepping him for trial.
You mean prepping him for that ass?
(SIGHS)
Answer it. Come on.
So I have to pretend like we haven't found their killer cousin?
Not happening.
You're no fun.
There he is.
Hey, uh, good news...
Philip was in town the night of the murders.
What's going on?
How do you know?
He posted to Reddit that night, and his IP address puts him in the city.
Nice.
Will one of you explain right now.
I asked your boo to help us out on the hacking angle.
When?
Today. I...
I texted you.
Where should I set up?
On the couch.
Take whatever space you need.
Thanks.
What the hell?
Relax. He's not my type.
(CAR DOOR OPENS)
(SIGHS) I thought you said no contact.
Between you and Nate.
How are you?
I know you're mad.
And I would've called, but I haven't had a second to myself.
(CHUCKLING)
Do I look mad?
I know you got a lot going on right now.
I can see that, but you're not the only one with a personal life.
Who is she?
(LAUGHING) Oh, no, no, no, you don't get to ask me that.
You're blushing.
Oh, stop. (CHUCKLES)
I have a life in New York, yes, but don't worry.
There's no one worth being jealous over.
(SIGHS)
I have to make a confession.
I'm maybe just a tiny bit happy that Nate killed his wife.
'Cause it means
I get to see you again.
You could throw the hearing.
Nate goes to jail, we run off together.
We can open a practice, but in Paris...
Work 20 hours a week.
Spend weekends in bed.
All right.
We've both got work.
Thank you for taking care of him.
Anytime.
(SIGHS)
Please talk to me.
You should be helping
Laurel prep Dale.
Can I at least explain to you my version so you can hear it from me instead of Sinclair, who I assume is the one that told you?
It doesn't matter who told me.
It does.
Look, I made this stupid video at my parent's lake house.
We threw a party, everyone was drinking, a bunch of people went upstairs.
Four guys took one girl upstairs, so don't you dare say you didn't know what they were going to do to her.
I didn't, though.
But later, she said everyone saw her leave the house crying.
Or were you so drunk you don't remember calling your dad and asking him to cover it all up?
I called him because
I was worried about her.
He decided to cover it up.
And you let him.
And now she thinks about it every day, what you didn't do, while you get to live your life without even thinking about her.
I do. I think about her.
But still you haven't done anything about it.
You lied.
You did not text me.
Because I knew you'd say not to come.
For your own good.
You're putting yourself in danger.
Okay, if I'm in danger, then so are you.
And guess what?
I'm a big boy.
I can make my own decisions.
Besides, everything you guys get to do in this house is way more fun than my boring-ass IT job.
Will you please...
Just take this seriously, okay?
No. I've made up my mind,
I'm not leaving.
So stop being such a buzzkill.
ANNALISE: Where are we on Dale's case?
Uh, what if we pin it on Sharon, say she forced him to jump?
You can't force someone to commit suicide.
ASHER: Says who?
And since when are you the expert on all things suicide?
Your mother killed herself.
How do you know that?
Wes. I'm gonna put you on another case.
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Why hide back here?
There's room in the front.
Annalise wouldn't want you to miss a word.
Oh. Um, no, I'm just doing some research for class.
BAILIFF: All rise!
Right.
This is case 903921, an evidentiary hearing to determine whether there is cause to test the postmortem sample of Nia Lahey's blood.
The burden is on the prosecution to establish the relevance of such testing.
Ms. Sinclair, shall we begin?
MICHAELA: Frank.
What?
Look. This report, it shows the police found DNA at the Hapstall crime scene that doesn't match anyone that lives or works at the mansion.
Sinclair probably filed it in the wrong folder so we wouldn't find it.
Friggin' mystery DNA.
Yeah.
If it matches Philip, it puts him at the murder scene.
We could sneak into his house, get a sample.
We are not breaking into our suspect's house.
OLIVER: Hey, that sounded scary.
Who are you?
Um, Oliver.
It's an honor to meet you, Ms...
Professor Keating...
Mrs. Keating.
You're the man that's constantly saving our asses.
It's nothing really.
I just...
No, it's something to me.
Thank you for your hard work.
She's so much nicer than you said.
Did Mrs. Lahey ever express to you her desire to end her life when you were her nurse?
It's quite common for oncology patients to talk about dying.
To the point of asking for pills to kill themselves, which your fellow nurses claim Mrs. Lahey asked you about?
Objection. Hearsay.
I'll rephrase.
Did you provide Mr. Lahey with the potentially lethal drug, secobarbital?
No. Of course not.
Could you please read the visitor log and tell us what time
Mr. Lahey arrived at the hospital on the day of his wife's death?
5:02 p.m.
And according to Ms. Lahey's death certificate, what was the time of her death?
6:42 p.m.
So she passed an hour and a half after Mr. Lahey arrived at the hospital.
If that's what you say.
Isn't that also the same amount of time it takes a lethal dose of secobarbital to kill someone?
Neither the prosecutor nor the witness can testify to medical facts.
Well, it doesn't take a doctor to conclude that Mr. Lahey poisoned his wife to death.
Objection.
You don't understand, do you, what's it's like to watch someone you love dying when they're begging you to kill them?
Strike that response.
It's taking away their pain.
Why shouldn't that be legal?
Your witness.
Ms. Rothlow?
No questions, your honor.
What the hell?
WES: Nate lost.
What?
The judge only took
15 minutes to decide.
They're gonna test Nia's blood.
That's not all.
She didn't cross the nurse.
What do you mean?
Eve. I think she threw the case.
I ordered you a vodka.
I thought we're not supposed to be seen together.
(GUFFAWS) Relax.
I don't think anyone in the American Bar Association is hanging out here.
Would you eat potato skins if I ordered some?
Stop this, and talk to me.
Or mozzarella sticks?
Eve, please, tell me...
Did you throw the case?
Is that what your spy told you?
Is he right?
No.
Who is he, by the way?
You two aren't...
I don't sleep with my students.
You could.
You're single now.
Just tell me, why didn't you cross the nurse?
Because we'd already lost.
If Nate didn't do this, he'd want Nia's blood tested just to prove he's innocent.
That doesn't mean that you don't cross your key witness.
It does if you want to keep her on your side.
What are you up to?
(CHUCKLES)
Nate knows the plan.
That's all you need to know.
Why are you doing this?
Because you asked me to.
That can't be the only reason.
I told you
I don't expect anything from you.
But shouldn't you?
Because I want to be the person that can give you what you want.
I do, but...
You are not in a place to choose anyone. I know.
Which is why it's good
I'm not asking you to.
We're old friends who enjoy each other's company.
That's all.
All right?
Did you two want to order something?
I'll have another one.
And, um...
Potato skins and mozzarella sticks.
What the hell.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
(LIP SYNCHING TO MUSIC)
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER)
WES: This can't be real.
I asked Oliver to look up
Asher and Trotter Lake, and this is what came up.
What are you doing?
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)
Watching you try to rap.
This is a prank, right?
ASHER: Give it to me.
You didn't want to make this?
Please, it's just a stupid thing
I made in college.
An expensive stupid thing.
Seriously, how much did daddy pay for that?
It doesn't matter, and I hate you, Oliver, for finding it.
BONNIE: Turn it off.
I said turn it off!
Don't make me be Annalise and yell at you to do your jobs.
Hey. (BREATHES DEEPLY)
You think you could find a prosecutor's address for me?
(IN SPANISH ACCENT) Hi!
Hello.
I was wondering if you could help me.
Hope so.
(CHUCKLES)
I was at a dinner party last night, and I shared a cab with a woman to here.
She left her gloves.
At least I think this was her building.
(CHUCKLES)
Here's her picture.
Do you recognize her?
Sharon. Yeah.
But she doesn't actually live here.
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
They're screwing.
Sharon and the prosecutor.
I had a gut feeling when I saw them together, so I went to his apartment, and the doorman confirmed it.
Sharon goes there all the time.
Maybe she meets him there for meetings.
Late at night?
'Cause that's when the doorman's seen her there.
That doesn't mean he'll testify against the D.A. he works for.
What if the doorman liked me?
Wait. You're willing to screw the guy to get him to take the stand?
No, I won't actually have sex with him.
But you can use sex.
Be honest.
Is there any chance you're wrong about this?
Nope.
They're sleeping together.
I know it.
JUDGE: Ms. Keating, are you ready to call your first witness?
ANNALISE: I am, your honor.
I'd like to call
Assistant District Attorney,
Barrett Nelson.
Objection.
Putting a prosecutor on the stand is completely unprecedented.
A.D.A. Nelson brought this on himself.
Ms. Keating is grandstanding, nothing more.
If I'm grandstanding, then why not take the stand?
A man of integrity such as yourself, you have absolutely nothing to hide, right?
LAUREL: (IN SPANISH ACCENT)
I'm sorry.
This will just take a minute. Then we can go get a coffee.
I'd wait for you all day, senorita.
(LAUGHING) Oh, my God, you're hilarious!
Well...
ANNALISE: You would help Mrs. Tidwell whenever she needed a restraining order, is that correct?
Over 20 orders in all against your client.
I'd be happy to go over each one in detail.
And was there ever a conflict of interest affecting your ability to fairly prosecute my client?
Not that I know of.
Allow me to help you out.
Did you ever have a relationship with Mrs. Tidwell that became romantic?
That's a slanderous accusation.
ANNALISE: Not if it's true.
Answer the question,
Mr. Nelson.
Have you been sleeping with Sharon Tidwell?
Of course not.
(CHUCKLING)
There you are.
She wants to talk to you.
Right now?
That's what she said.
I'm so sorry.
Come with me really quick?
Sure. (CHUCKLES)
Oh, I got this door, buddy.
(CHUCKLES)
Really? You're telling me that there's no one in this courtroom that can testify to such an inappropriate relationship?
Your doorman, for example?
(CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY)
(SPECTATORS MURMURING)
What the hell is this?
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
You're a material witness.
The judge can hold you in contempt if you leave.
Are you prosecuting my client to cover up the fact that you are actually the man that drove
Marco to suicide?
You are out of control.
You were sleeping with his wife, which means that you are the "he" that Marco kept referring to in his 911 call.
Isn't that right,
Mr. Nelson?
Are you not answering because you know that anything you say will prove prosecutorial misconduct?
You'd be disbarred or, worse, be sent to prison?
I take the Fifth.
(SPECTATORS MURMURING)
JUDGE: Mr. Nelson,
I want to be sure that you know what you're doing.
NELSON: I do, your honor.
I assert the Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
(SPECTATORS MURMURING)
I said you could do it, and you did it.
I'm free!
And I have another chance with Sharon.
No way their relationship survives this.
Sharon hates you, Dale.
You're a stalker, you're pathetic, and you're fired.
You're welcome.
Excuse me?
For helping you win the case.
You want the trophy, it's in a box in the basement.
Is this because of Frank?
'Cause out of all the terrible things that happen in that house, us being together...
I don't care that you two are screwing.
You do.
Otherwise, why treat me like crap and let everyone else act crazy?
'Cause they are, all of them.
They're a mess.
And I'm the one watching out for them, fixing problems before you even know they exist.
Don't you think I know that?
Why would I?
You don't talk to me.
Because I don't need to.
Me not paying attention to you is the best compliment you could ever get,
'cause that means
I don't have to worry about you.
Go back to the office and stop being needy.
(CELLPHONE RINGS)
Is that her?
Probably wants an update.
She worries about you.
She should.
What's your deal with her?
Oh. (SCOFFS)
Really? We're doing this?
What? You worry this will get more weird?
(SIGHS) Yeah.
I don't know. Um...
I missed her, I guess.
I have fun when I'm with her.
You?
I hate her.
Yeah, but not really.
So, you ready to do this, or...
Do I need to give you a big speech first?
No.
I'm good.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(SIGHS)
NATE: Hey.
Oh, my God. Nate.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
You were looking out for me.
No, I never should've exploded like that.
It's just that prosecutor.
She's a nightmare.
I know.
That's actually why I'm here.
JUDGE: In the matter of case number 903921, the Commonwealth contends that the victim's death is a potential homicide.
Therefore, per my instructions, an independent lab has completed a full panel on Nia Lahey's blood sample.
The toxicology report states the following.
"The blood-drug screen test found no trace of secobarbital
"or any other potentially lethal
"medication in
Mrs. Lahey's sample."
Mr. Lahey, this court extends its deepest sympathies for your loss.
We're adjourned.
(GAVEL BANGS)
(SOFTLY) Thank you.
WES: You doctored the results.
Got someone from the hospital to switch the blood sample or change the paperwork.
Case is over.
Go tell Annalise we won.
Why do you do it, help her like this, even though you could get in trouble?
(CHUCKLES) You're making up stories in your head.
And I can ask you the same thing.
You're the one playing her spy when you should be in class.
I don't have a choice.
What does that mean?
Nothing. Just...
Congratulations on the case.
ASHER: Look,
I screwed up big time.
And, yeah, I was wasted, but you're right.
I saw them go up there, and I didn't do anything, and...
Maybe that says a lot about me, about how stupid I was and how stupid I am, but I didn't know that they were gonna do that.
I didn't, and...
It happened, though, and they raped her, and that's on me.
And I just want to make it right.
I want to reach out to her and apologize and...
And give her some money.
Money can't fix this.
I'll testify against my dad.
I want to tell the D.A. that he covered this all up.
And what does Tiffany get out of that?
She doesn't want to talk to you or go to court and recount all the horrible things that happened to her, and even you thinking she would shows how you still don't get this.
She went to a party, and her life changed forever, and everything she does now, she works so hard to be okay, while you just get to keep on being you, oblivious and the fun guy.
I can't look at you the same anymore.
I'm so sorry.
I don't care.
I do, 'cause I...
I care about you.
And I love you, and I understand why this is your thing.
My thing?
Yeah, because of Sam, and what he did to you.
She told you, didn't she?
(CELLPHONE RINGING)
Put that away.
No more work tonight.
(CELLPHONE RINGING)
To Nate.
(CHUCKLES) Um...
When are we going to Paris?
Oh, whenever you want.
But let's just make sure we get a flat with a view of the Sacre-Coer, even if it's outrageously expensive.
Hmm. Oh, that's not a problem.
I've got Sam money.
(BOTH LAUGH)
What?
Nothing.
Say it.
It's about that boy.
I told you I'm not sleeping with him.
I know.
It's not that.
He's the one you're protecting, right?
I don't want to talk about it.
I wouldn't either.
It doesn't make any sense.
All this craziness to protect some student?
He's not just some student.
It's him.
No.
You are a very good person.
No. I'm not.
Fine, you're not.
(SNIFFS)
But I still get to think so.
(COMPUTER BEEPS)
OLIVER: Oh, I got spanked.
By who?
Uh, I'm on DudeForDude.
Philip has an online profile.
Closet case, obviously.
So I made one, too.
You've lost it.
Hey, we can invite him on a coffee date and get his DNA from the coffee cup.
Oh, my God.
You are one of us now.
No, he's not.
And you're not going on a coffee date with a serial killer.
Okay, okay, fine.
But, um, what about you?
I used your pic.
You're much hotter than me.
Enough with the low self-esteem!
Seriously. I'd spank you before Walsh.
CONNOR: What's going on with you?
Honestly?
Because you've gone too far here.
Which is exactly what Annalise would want us to do to win our case.
Frank, this is a good plan, right?
CONNOR: No, it's not.
And I'm not going anywhere near the guy...
You have to!
This is the only thing that can get Catherine and Caleb off!
I don't care about your boyfriend!
I'll do it.
I can say that I used some random guy's pic because of my low self-esteem.
That's not a bad idea.
You would do that?
No, you're not doing it.
You hear me?
You don't get to act crazy anymore.
What if I want to?
(MONITOR BEEPS)
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
(SLURRING) Hi.
What's going on?
You told him.
I didn't convince him not to testify.
That was you.
You fixed it like always, except this time,
I was the card you traded.
I traded your past, but I saved your future.
And it worked, or else you'd be in prison right now.
I don't get to be mad about this, is that what you're saying?
No, I'm saying you don't get to be emotional about this.
You knew what trouble we were in.
What else could I have done?
Stop denying what you did!
LAUREL:
How is this a good idea?
MICHAELA: How is it not?
Because he could get caught or dragged into the bathroom where this weirdo could torture and kill him.
Or maybe he's just gonna have a cup of coffee with the guy.
It's a stakeout.
It's sexy.
MICHAELA: Oh, my God.
Is that him?
You exposed me to him!
ANNALISE: I didn't expose you.
I saved you.
You killed a girl in my basement and put a plastic bag over her head.
To protect you!
And I did what I did to protect you.
No.
You did this to ruin me.
The one good thing
I had in my life.
Oh, don't you dare.
Every good thing in your life is because of me.
You mean despite you.
I'll be right back.
Where the hell are you going?
I have to pee.
There's a gas station just across the street.
Hey.
Get me a Snickers.
(RINGING)
Pick up!
Pick up, pick up, pick up.
Pick up, pick up...
(GASPS) Oh!
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
(RINGING CONTINUES)
Everything that you're coming at me with right now is because of what your father did to you, and you need to finally deal with that, Bonnie...
I deal with it every day.
Well, so do I!
We both do, okay?
I'm not the person to be angry with right now!
Shut up!
You may hate me for it, but it worked.
Shut up! Shut up!
All right, Bonnie?
It worked!
Shut up!
Here.
(DOOR CLOSES)
This isn't a Snickers.
You eat too much sugar.
I think it's beginning to affect your judgment.
You knew how much this would hurt me, out of everyone you knew!
But you did it because you wanted to.
You don't know how to love anyone.
I don't know how to love anyone.
All right.
When you go back to that fancy apartment and you're rolling around in bed with that 25-year-old boy and you're not hanging from a bedsheet behind some metal bars, then you tell me that I don't love you.
(VOICE BREAKING)
I want you to die.
That's what I want.
That it was you they killed in this house, not Sam.
Because he'd have never done this to me.
(SNIFFLES)
(CELLPHONE CHIMES)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
ANNALISE: What the hell
were you thinking?
Get him out of there.
Relax. I got eyes on him.
You're an idiot.
You need to shut it down right now.
But we're...
ANNALISE: Right now!
Or else I'll call the police myself!
(SIGHS)
You tattled?
What?
Date's over.
Why?
Got ratted out.
Let's go.
âª I don't need no teacher
âª You come on my turf
I be like, "Bye, Felicia"
âª "Bye, Felicia, Bye, Felicia"
âª I know how that work we be like, "Bye, Felicia"
âª I know how that work
I don't need no teacher
âª You come on my turf
I be like, "Bye, Felicia"
âª On my turf, I be like
"Bye, Felicia"
âª Bye, Felicia, bye, Felicia
âª You come on
I don't need no teacher
âª Bye, Felicia
I know how it works âª
PHILIP: Hi, Oliver.
(GASPS)
How's your night going?
(BREATHES SHAKILY)
What do we do?
Stop them.
Stop!
Michaela, no.

ANNALISE: Previously on
How to Get Away With Murder...
I'm on DudeForDude.
Philip has an online profile.
We can invite him on a coffee date and get his DNA.
You're not going on a coffee date with a serial killer.
You need to shut it down right now.
But we're...
ANNALISE: Right now!
You tattled?
Hi, Oliver.
How's your night going?
She told you, didn't she?
(SCREAMS)
(GASPING)
You seriously thought we wouldn't notice?
Don't yell at me!
Yell at him!
What's wrong with you?
Me?
How are you both okay with this?
BONNIE: This was your idea?
I didn't do any...
Don't lie to me.
There is no decision here.
It was already made, and you agreed.
So either get on board, or you're the next dead body out there.
Yeah.
Give it to me.
(WATER RUNNING)
You told him.
You knew what trouble we were in.
What else could I have done?
I'm not the person to be angry with right now!
BONNIE: Shut up!
You may hate me for it, but it worked.
Shut up!
All right, Bonnie?
Shut up! Shut up!
It worked!
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
I want you to die.
That's what I want.
That it was you they killed in this house, not Sam.
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
(KEYPAD CLICKING)
(CELL PHONE PINGS)
Hey.
Hey.
Is everything okay?
Why wouldn't it be?
Do you want to come in?
Yeah.
You need anything?
Coffee, food?
I want to sit.
OLIVER: You're here...
Because you know where I live.
Don't touch that.
Oh, okay. I'm sorry we catfished you.
It's just because
I... I think you're really cute.
And we really wanted to meet you...
We meaning me and my boyfriend, Connor, and now I told you his real name.
But that's fine because...
Uh, we like you.
(STUTTERING) And we've really been actually looking to have a threesome...
Just, please, don't kill me. Please.
No.
I don't want to kill you.
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
LAUREL: So, kill me for being a snitch.
Just don't pretend like this isn't about your ego being bruised!
I'm pissed 'cause you tattled to the teacher like the spoiled little MAP you are.
What's a MAP?
LAUREL: Excuse me?
A Mexican American princess.
I'm actually surprised someone who barely left Fishtown even knows the term.
Classist.
I'm making you nervous.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Yes.
I don't think
I've seen you nervous before.
Of course you have.
No.
Well, not that I can remember, but you hide it well, like most things.
You know more about me than most people.
That's sad.
'Cause I don't know you.
LAUREL: So, I'm a princess
just because I dared to
disagree with you?
FRANK: You're entitled, and you think you're better than everyone else, and it's all because you were raised in some castle!
Are you seriously that rich?
Apparently, according to Mr. Mansplain here.
Don't deny it.
You grew up around money, and you like to pretend you didn't.
How much money?
It doesn't matter!
Get out, Walsh.
You brought it up. I just...
I mean we're at your place.
Oh.
You know...
You two are the perfect example of why straight people shouldn't be allowed to breed.
ANNALISE: I don't know what that means.
It means you play people.
Doesn't everyone?
You're better at it than the rest of us.
Oh, I don't know if that's true.
You think anyone else would get away with everything you've done to me?
Maybe I won't get away with it.
True.
I should kill you.
Or at least make sure your life is hell.
But instead, I just come here.
Why?
I don't know.
I'm a mess.
No.
You're just sad.
You know, you can always come to me, Nate.
Come over here.
Uh, Nate...
I said get over here!
You need to decide whether you want to forgive me.
I said I was sorry, and I meant it.
But I'm not gonna spread my legs as some sort of payment.
You're too drunk to drive.
Sleep on the couch.
Oliver?
Oli, are you here?
(KEYS JINGLE)
(RAPID KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Oliver's gone.
That's why you'll never be a lawyer!
You don't have basic common sense!
You're mad at me, I get it, but we don't know if anything happened yet.
We do. He's been kidnapped.
'Cause you came home to some spilled milk on the floor?
He left his phone.
Maybe he went off to cheat on you with some other guy.
Frank.
I don't understand why we aren't calling the police.
Police are already here.
Nate's not involved in this.
CONNOR: Why not?
Let's fill him in.
Mr. Walsh...
We illegally hacked some guy who's a suspect on our other case, and he found out, and now he's kidnapped my boyfriend.
You should go.
No. It's okay.
I can't have you involved in this.
I'm already involved.
And maybe I can help.
Of course you can help.
You could call the police station.
You know, he's only been gone for an hour.
And it only takes a second to kill someone, Laurel!
Connor, you're scared.
I understand that.
But Oliver needs for you to keep your head on straight right now.
Can you do that?
CONNOR: He shouldn't have even been involved.
But Frank forced him to come.
Actually, Oliver seemed quite happy to help us.
CONNOR: 'Cause he didn't know any better!
I mean, he's not like us.
He doesn't do this all the time.
If anything happens to him, it's on you.
LAUREL: Why can't we find him on our own?
How?
LAUREL: I don't know.
Sinclair already wants to take us all down.
If we go to the police, it's gonna give her exactly what she needs!
MICHAELA: She's right.
No, we are not doing this again!
It takes 24 hours to be missing...
We're talking about a violent killer who wants to make him into a skin suit!
Stop it! Stop!
Call it in.
Annalise, wait...
I'll figure a way out of this, like always!
Call them.
Hey. Officer Lahey,
15th Precinct.
I'm off duty.
I got a potential missing-person situation.
Hey, guys.
Where the hell have you been?
Oh, I was with Philip.
Call you back.
Hi. Uh, I'm Philip.
Philip stopped by.
And, well, he wanted to talk, so I suggested we go across the street to the Soup Palace.
Um, I tried to explain a little bit about everything, the Hapstall case, but since I don't really know that much, like I told him,
I suggested we come here.
This has all been a giant misunderstanding.
Don't lie.
I have a security alert for hackers.
Sometimes gamers try to steal my conquest points
'cause I have so many.
World of Warcraft.
That's why I made the profile on the gay site.
I'm not, by the way, a gay.
I only did that after I saw you guys hacked me, and Oliver told me why.
You think I'm related to those rich people, right?
My birth parents are Jim and Joan Meyerfield.
They live in Iowa.
I haven't met them, but the adoption agency gave me their names a few years ago, and...
Look, I know that I'm weird.
People have always called me that, but I stick to myself, and I don't bother anyone.
All right, I'm not someone who could do that.
Kill someone?
You're wrong about me.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault, all of it.
And if you need to blame someone, just blame me.
I already do blame you.
What you did was illegal, especially since you're a lawyer, so I have to go to the cops, or at least find someone to sue you.
What do you want?
Tell me, and we'll see what we can do.
Uh...
I don't know yet.
Good night.
Cyberstalking, harassment, invasion of privacy, and that's just Oliver, but that's all they need to start going in on me.
Let me stay on Philip, see what he does.
So you can screw up again?
No, I don't want you anywhere near this!
I'll tail him.
Stop it.
I can't have you...
I got the day off.
What else am I gonna do?
CONNOR: Go get your computer.
Why?
So that we can destroy it before Boo Radley goes to the police.
He might not go to the police.
Mmm, of course he is.
Not if he's the killer.
He knows that they'll start looking into him.
Michaela, what are you doing?
He was sitting right there.
If we find a strand of hair, we can test it for his DNA, see if he's lying about his birth parents.
I'll go get some tape, see if he left any skin cells.
Guys...
Yes!
Won't this work instead?
He drank like four Cokes at the Soup Palace.
ASHER: And nobody thought to call me?
It wasn't a party.
Okay, but I still work in this house, too, and it feels really mean that you guys never call me for the cool crap.
ANNALISE: It's not all about you, Mr. Millstone.
Hey, I think I might've screwed up with Bonnie.
I know you screwed up with Bonnie, and we're not doing this now.
Let me guess, from Sinclair?
More discovery on the Hapstalls.
She's trying to drown us in paper.
Frank?
Yeah?
When are we getting the DNA results?
Just about to run to the lab.
Bonnie would've already been at the lab.
Laurel, with me.
No.
Take Mr. Millstone.
I need Laurel here.
Let's go, doucheface.
Okay, can we please retire that nickname?
I know you're mad at Frank, but to be fair, he's...
Don't defend your boyfriend.
(DOOR CLOSES)
I need you to be my new Bonnie.
What happened to the old Bonnie?
She's out sick.
So, can you handle it, or should I ask
Miss Pratt?
No. I'll do whatever you need.
ASHER: Have you heard from Bonbon today?
Why? You do something to piss her off?
No, I mean, yes, she's pissed at me, but the point is, she's not called me back, and I'm worried about her.
My junk just inverted having to listen to your whiny ass.
WOMAN: What's up, Frank?
Wow. Rodge hit gold again?
I hate him.
Baby number two, and we're still in a one-bedroom.
What you want?
Rush job.
You know I can't do this anymore.
You sure?
'Cause my uncle might have a duplex opening up near State Street.
CONNOR: Do it.
There's still some stuff
I need to save on here.
Okay, I will do a whole naked pic session for you tomorrow.
But maybe Laurel's right.
Maybe Philip won't go to the police.
Maybe he's just...
What is wrong with you?
This is serious, Oliver, like end-of-life-as-you-know-it serious.
Okay, you're being a little dramatic.
Oh, you think?
(GRUNTING)
(SIGHS)
I feel better.
Do you?
(VOICEMAIL BEEPS)
Bonnie, it's me.
I'll give you space if that's what you need.
But you know me.
I screw up.
(SIGHS) And I'm here when you're ready.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
(DOOR OPENS)
Michaela would like to see you.
MICHAELA: I'm sorry.
I can speak for myself.
Excuse me, you can't just...
Laurel, it's okay.
What is it?
Caleb keeps calling me.
Tell him there's no progress on the case.
That's what
I keep saying, but it's not working, so I was thinking
I could go over there and distract them, review the suspect list or pretend to prep them for the stand again.
No.
We can't just keep avoiding them.
I know.
You're right.
ANNALISE: I was wrong not to tell you before.
Unfortunately, Philip now knows he's a suspect.
Have you ever seen him before?
No.
Catherine?
No.
WES: You sure?
You've lied to us before.
CALEB: Who do you think you are?
ANNALISE: Caleb...
You're lucky we haven't fired you yet!
ANNALISE: You're right.
We have good news, though.
We're testing Philip's DNA against the sample we found at the crime scene, and if it matches,
Sinclair will drop the charges against you.
You don't know that.
MICHAELA: We do.
We'll be able to prove that Philip had motive and means.
If the DNA matches.
Until then, all we know is that you screwed up again.
And what about our safety?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
This guy knows who we are, where we live.
Don't you guys have like a million servants?
We fired everyone after Sandra leaked that photo.
We have someone watching Philip.
Don't worry.
Someone who actually knows what they're doing?
Annalise?
Not now.
It's Sinclair.
She wants to offer
Catherine and Caleb a plea deal.
Fifteen years, each.
I think that's more than fair, don't you?
ANNALISE: Do not address my clients.
Why this deal now?
EMILY: Honestly?
Resources are a little scarce around here lately.
Which makes it easier for us to beat you in trial.
Where I'll be gunning for life sentences.
Fifteen years seems like a great deal in comparison.
We'll talk about it.
The offer expires after 5:00 p.m. today.
After that, we go to trial.
Let's go.
This is good.
We're close to trial, and Sinclair just proved that she's scared.
And she should be.
She's based her case entirely on the testimony of a dead racist and a missing murder weapon.
Now, I don't smile often, but this...
I'm smiling.
Shouldn't we at least consider taking it?
See? This is exactly what she wants.
She's presented you with a deal so you'd get scared.
Well, it worked.
I think we need to at least think about it.
We're not pleading guilty.
It's 15 years versus the rest of our lives.
Or zero years because I will win.
I want the day to think about it.
(SIGHS) I'll talk some sense into him.
ANNALISE: It's time to break out the boobs again.
Go to the mansion and convince him not to take the deal.
On it.
What if he's guilty, though?
He's not guilty.
Then why else is he even considering it?
Innocent people take bad plea deals all the time.
Go. Make me proud.
Professor Keating,
I have a question about this photo from the crime scene of the mansion.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
I still haven't heard from her.
Do you blame her?
I know, but look, I'm sorry,
I can't just do nothing here.
That's exactly what you're gotta do.
I know Bonnie.
Give her space.
Annalise?
Great, okay, we don't need to look at blood spatter.
Who is it?
It's Catherine.
She wants to see Wes.
Wow. So, it was you who painted that portrait in the living room, too?
Yeah.
And don't say it's creepy.
(CHUCKLING)
No, I wasn't.
I was just gonna say it's...
I didn't bring you here to talk about painting.
You think we should take the plea deal, don't you?
CALEB: She sent you to get in my head, right?
No. I asked to come.
You need someone to talk this through with.
Great.
Get me someone objective, then, who doesn't work for Annalise.
You should talk to
Annalise about this.
I don't trust her.
Neither does Caleb.
And whatever Michaela's telling him right now is based on the fact that she's into him, but you've leveled with me before, and I need you to do it again.
So, should we take it?
That depends.
If you're guilty.
We didn't do it.
Then you've got your answer.
You need to...
Consider the life you'd have once you get out of jail...
Just another black felon no one wants to give a second chance to.
Yeah, but at least we'd...
Be able to get out in eight years or less for good behavior, right?
And we have no idea what's gonna happen during the trial.
True. The system's not always about justice. It's...
About which attorney can twist the truth in their favor.
Annalise can do that.
Take me out of the equation and put yourself in it.
If you were me...
Walking in my shoes.
What would you do?
I'd bet on Annalise.
Honestly?
WES: I told her
I'd take the deal.
You what?
If they're guilty...
Who says they're guilty?
You're letting your feelings for Caleb cloud your judgment.
I don't have feelings for Caleb.
I'm doing my job!
Leave us alone, Michaela.
But he just screwed our...
Leave!
(SIGHS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
Is this about Rebecca?
You believed her when she said she was innocent, and she hurt you.
Yeah, this isn't about that.
Is it about me, then?
Are you still mad at me? Nate?
No.
Then why tell Catherine to take the deal?
Because that's what
I should've done.
I should've...
Turned myself in for Sam.
Instead, it just weighs on me, on you, on all of us.
So, if I just...
Told the truth, done whatever time
I deserved, we could've all moved on by now.
You protected
Rebecca, and now
I'm protecting you.
No one deserves to go to jail for that.
You hear me?
Wes?
Okay.
Go home.
What?
You're letting your feelings cloud your judgment.
You're off the case until I say otherwise.
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)
I can't risk losing my job right now, Frank.
No one has to lose their job.
We just need you to put us up on the list.
I tried, but some ADA just dumped like 300 samples on me this morning.
So sneak us in with those.
Wait. What ADA?
Just tell me how I can sweeten the pot.
Was it Emily Sinclair?
Yeah. Why?
There's a bug in the house.
Sinclair's been tappin' our asses, and not in the good way.
Why do you think that?
Because it's what she wanted all along.
That's why she needed me to testify, so she could put a wiretap on the house.
JUDGE: This is a closed hearing for a wiretap warrant on the residence of Annalise Keating.
But you didn't testify.
Exactly, so she
Trojan-horsed it in with the new discovery.
That's why she suddenly offered Catherine and
Caleb the plea deal, and knew to stall the DNA sample, because she's been listening to every word we've been saying in that house since yesterday.
Maybe Mr. Millstone should be my new Frank.
Okay, we need to scour through this
Hapstall discovery.
Look for it as if your life depended on it.
No stopping until you find the evidence that pins this on Philip and not our clients.
Speak!
We'll be on it, boss.
I'll look through the zip drives, files.
Witness statements.
(PAPERS RUSTLING)
Oh! Oh! Yikes!
(CLEARS THROAT)
Nobody's leaving till we find the...
Evidentiary file.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Law office of Annalise Keating.
CATHERINE: Where's Annalise?
Catherine?
She needs to come over right away.
What happened?
It's Caleb.
He took the plea deal.
It's illegal to talk to the ADA without me.
It's called ex parte communication, and it voids any deal you made.
That's only if Sinclair reached out to me, but I called her and negotiated the deal on my own.
It's a terrible deal!
You took 30 years!
So Catherine would get none!
Selfish idiot.
MICHAELA: She's right.
You are selfish and an idiot.
But until we go in front of the judge, it's still just an offer, so you're gonna call her back and tell her you changed your mind.
Do it!
No. I made my decision, and as my lawyer, you have to carry it out.
(SIGHS)
(CONNOR CLEARING THROAT)
What the hell?
ASHER: And nobody thought to call me?
It wasn't a party.
Okay, but I still work in this house, too.
(MOUTHING)
ASHER: I was right.
Well, mostly right.
It didn't come in the discovery, but it came with the discovery.
Another win for Mr. Millstone.
CONNOR: All right, so, what do we do now?
We take the bug to the police, exterminate it?
No. We use it.
ANNALISE: I'm advising
Caleb to take the plea deal.
(STIFFLY) But why?
Because he confessed to me at the house.
So? Sinclair's got no case.
Plus, we've been handing her her ass this whole time.
That's not true anymore.
Caleb showed me where he was hiding the gun.
It's in a toolbox in the basement.
MICHAELA: But why'd he do it?
ANNALISE: Because of Catherine.
They've been sleeping together since they were teenagers and finally confessed to Ursula and Grant.
(VEHICLE DOORS CLOSING)
And then they threatened to go public with it.
Their parents threatened them back,
threatened to cut them out of the will.
(POUNDING ON DOOR)
Caleb snapped that night.
What is this?
We have a warrant to search the premises.
Can't we just hide the gun, though?
Well, that's what I thought, but now Catherine knows, too.
She told Caleb that she would go to the police
and tell them everything.
I told Caleb to call Sinclair, take the deal.
Thirty years for killing your parents in cold blood is not bad.
ANNALISE: Do they teach
Fourth Amendment violations
in night school?
'Cause this is what this is.
You have no probable cause here, and any judge is gonna agree with me.
Go ahead.
Call the judge.
By that time, we'll have found our murder weapon.
Ms. Sinclair?
What the hell is going on?
Quiet.
No luck. Basement's clear.
Check it again.
We turned over the whole thing.
No gun, no anything.
What time is it?
The offer expires after 5:00 p.m. today.
5:15.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
Hi.
NATE: I'm at the station.
Philip's here.
What?
He's giving a statement.
How long has he been in there?
NATE: About a half-hour.
What's he saying?
I'll find out.
I think I can fix this.
What do you mean?
You don't need to know.
No, Nate, you just got your job back.
And I already made up my mind.
We'll talk later.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
REED: Let me guess.
Our guy's got a record?
This is his third time reporting a stalking incident in the past two years.
REED: So, he's off his lithium again.
WOMAN: We at least need to look into it.
REED: Agreed. Tomorrow.
But right now, there is a guy waiting at the bar to meet you.
Another cousin?
Nephew.
You'll like him.
He's even got a job.
I will have her call you back as soon as
I hear from her.
(TELEPHONE BEEPS)
It suits you, the secretary shtick.
Wow. Thanks...
For being such a supportive boyfriend.
I'm protecting you.
You think she actually cares about you all of a sudden?
You're just being jealous because she picked me over you, and it's not cute.
No. I've just been around the Annalise block a few times and know she's just using you till
Bonnie's back.
Mmm.
ANNALISE: Or I actually admire her.
Miss Castillo could be me one day.
But you? You can't even get me DNA results when I need them.
I'm doing my best.
Not good enough.
(TELEPHONE RINGS)
Law office of...
Caleb? Slow down.
Where is she?
Already in there.
She must've called her behind my back.
I wonder who taught her that move.
Finally.
I'm gonna go to your boss and tell him that you've been having ex parte dealings not once but twice with my clients, and he's gonna send your hick ass back to whatever haystack you crawled out of!
I'm from Connecticut.
And don't be upset that your client did your job for you.
In fact, she negotiated a better deal than you would've.
Ten years while her brother serves none.
No way am I gonna let that go through.
But I want you to.
ANNALISE: I don't care.
There's no judge in their right mind who would let this fly!
EMILY: I guess we'll find out in an hour.
Noon was the only time Judge Garret had available.
See you then.
CATHERINE: I'm not changing my mind.
I know.
So, look me in the eye and tell me you're guilty.
'Cause 10 years for killing your parents is a deal
I can get behind, but only if you actually did it.
I didn't do it.
(SIGHS)
Then why are you doing this?
'Cause of Caleb.
He's not guilty, but he'll take the deal if that means protecting me.
But for once,
I have to take care of him.
You're not taking care of him.
You're punishing him.
I don't agree.
And you don't have to understand that, but you do have to be my lawyer here.
We're taking the deal.
ANNALISE: She's not
thinking straight, so
we have to think for her.
Call the house.
Tell everyone to get here.
They're already on their way.
We'll research the grounds to vitiate a guilty plea, and force the judge to reject the deal.
We're on it.
Sinclair negotiated with our client without our knowledge.
So, we sue for interference in our attorney-client relationship.
And what? Report her to the state bar?
That's gonna take days.
We only have 25 minutes.
We can tell the judge the ADA broke rule 4.2, which is about professional conduct.
Or we can ask for sanctions.
Fifteen minutes.
Catherine went to
Sinclair for a plea deal, not the other way around.
So? A defendant has the legal right to be stupid.
Two minutes.
BAILIFF: All rise!
(CLEARS THROAT)
JUDGE: This is a plea hearing for two counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Ursula Hapstall and Grant Hapstall.
It's a conflict of interest for an attorney to represent both defendants if one pleads guilty.
The defendant can waive the conflict.
It's starting.
She's gonna kill us.
Before the court accepts the plea, it must be shown on record that the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily understands the nature and consequences of her plea.
She could file a writ challenging the constitutionality of the plea deal.
That would take months.
And additionally, there must be a factual basis for the plea, which, frankly,
I don't believe exists.
She's stalling, Your Honor.
I am merely taking the matter seriously.
Given the severe punishment
Miss Hapstall might endure here,
I suggest that we send her out on a pre-plea sentence report before we proceed any further.
You guys, we can do this.
Or it's already too late, and we're just too dumb to know it.
Ms. Keating,
I've lost my patience.
It's not about patience but of a woman's life.
Enough of this.
Miss Hapstall, please stand.
Do you understand that you're pleading guilty to count one of the information, which charges you with first-degree murder in the death of Grant Hapstall?
CATHERINE: Yes.
I'm so sorry.
JUDGE: And count two, which charges you with first-degree murder in the death of Ursula Hapstall?
Yes.
And that if the court accepts your guilty pleas today, you will not have a right to appeal them.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Miss Hapstall, do you accept the prosecution's plea offer?
Do not answer.
Miss Castillo could be me one day.
But you? You can't even get me DNA results when I need them.
(ZIPPER UNZIPPING)
Ninety minutes' work for $50,000.
Think about the baby.
JUDGE: Ms. Keating,
I've had enough of this!
I need an answer from your client.
One moment, Your Honor.
I changed my mind, Your Honor.
I'm not accepting this deal.
(SPECTATORS MURMURING)
I messed it up.
I messed up real bad!
No. No, it's not gonna work.
I am breathing.
I'm trying. Can you please just...
I'll call you back.
You know, there are meds for that.
What is this?
Caleb and Catherine's acquittal.
But rather than bury it in boxes of discovery like a coward,
I'm bringing it to you face-to-face.
Philip Jessup's DNA is a 99.4% match to the DNA found at the crime scene, but that's not the best part.
The test shows an absence of heterozygosity.
He's the product of incest.
And we both know that Helena only had one brother.
Imagine, your parents are the sick ones, and you're the one that gets thrown out with the trash.
I'd have killed them, too.
Good luck in getting the jury to believe that the inbred weirdo didn't do it.
LAUREL: Are you wearing an apron?
I figured you could use a good meal after all the hard work you've been doing.
My special sauce.
Taste?
It's good.
Told ya.
Have a seat.
Wine's open.
Frank...
What happened...
We can't just not talk about it.
That's exactly what we're gonna do.
I'm not mad at you, if that's what you're worried about.
We had a fight.
And what Annalise said...
See, that's the name I don't want to hear right now.
This apartment needs to be an
Annalise-free zone.
But she's our boss.
You know she's more than that.
And she's smart.
And she knows the best way to break us up is to come between us.
We're not gonna let that happen.
Why do you think she doesn't want us to be together?
'Cause she's Annalise.
And that's the last we're gonna mention her.
Now, sit down, tie a napkin around your neck, and get ready to eat the best meatballs you ever had.
(UTENSILS CLATTERING)

like I'm actually getting

So, are you gonna give me a lecture or something?
No, but I am gonna teach you a lesson.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Yeah?

MICHAELA: Sorry to barge in.
What's wrong?
Nothing. Um, is Catherine here?
She's asleep.
Why? Are we in trouble?
No, no, no.
Everything's great.
Why are you here?
(CHUCKLES)
I'm sure I've just been making this all up in my head, or you're gay and
I've been misreading all the cues, but I just... I have to know, at least so I can stop wondering...
I like you.
That's unprofessional, I know.
That's why I haven't been too forward.
But you're not making it up.
You're beautiful.
And I like you.
(CHUCKLES)
It's, um...
It's not unprofessional.
Not anymore.
We won today, so...
So...
I've wanted to do this since the first time I saw you.
(CELL PHONE PINGS)
What happened?
Nothing. It's good news, actually.
Sinclair called the chief about Philip.
They're starting their investigation into him first thing in the morning.
(SIGHS)
Thank you so much.
I'll go.
Wait.
Why are you doing this?
Helping me?
It's not about helping you.
It's about Sinclair.
She's made my life hell, too.
Is that the only reason?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
You're nervous again?
I want to know you.
(BREATHING HEAVILY

Oh. Well, let's give him a show.

MICHAELA: You're scaring me.
I know.
But you'll see why.
WES: Look.
Right there.
It's one of Catherine's paintings.
MICHAELA: Oh, my God.
Is that...
I found it here last week.
ANNALISE: Sinclair just proved that she's scared.
She's based her case entirely on the testimony of a dead racist and a missing murder weapon.
What if she killed them?
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)
Hi.
Hey.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of this.

## S02E9

ANNALISE: Previously on
How to Get Away With Murder...
Emily Sinclair got the D.A. to open an investigation on me.
We're done, Ash.
ASHER: I'll testify against my dad.
I want to tell the D.A. that he covered this all up.
And what does Tiffany get out of that?
ASHER: I understand why this is your thing.
BONNIE: She told you?
You exposed me to him!
ANNALISE: I didn't expose you.
I saved you.
I want you to die.
What is this?
ANNALISE: Caleb and
Catherine's acquittal.
Philip Jessup's DNA is a 99.4% match to the DNA found at the crime scene.
He's the product of incest.
Philip's here.
I think I can fix this.
Look. Right there.
It's one of Catherine's paintings.
CALEB: I found it here last week.
What if she killed them?
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of this.
ANNALISE: No!
(GUNSHOT)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)
CONNOR: Where is she?
Still asleep.
So she could walk in any second and kill all of us. Great.
It's not her gun.
Someone planted it here.
Okay, well, then call Annalise because she's your lawyer, not us.
I told him not to.
Rule three point four.
If Annalise knows about evidence, it's illegal to obstruct the prosecution's access to it.
Oh, so you called me to obstruct justice with you?
I couldn't make this decision on my own.
What decision?
If there's no gun in the house, Sinclair still charges Philip.
There is a gun, Michaela.
It's right there.
Not if we get rid of it.
LAUREL: Shouldn't we get rid of the painting?
WES: We don't know that's the only thing that links them.
Or if it even means Catherine knows the guy.
He could have bought it online or from a gallery.
Yeah, 'cause her work is just so good.
Even if we get rid of it, there's still this photo.
That no one on the prosecution has noticed so far.
We're not getting rid of the painting.
At least not until we talk to Catherine.
Call her, tell her
I need to see her.
(DIALING)
CONNOR: You two banged, right?
I mean, that's why you're willing to tamper with evidence, because you're letting your vagina make all of your decisions?
So we had sex.
It's not affecting my judgment.
Prove it.
Leave the gun where it is.
If Caleb's telling the truth, then he shouldn't have anything to worry about.
I am telling the truth.
I totally believe you.
Fine. Leave.
I'll take care of it myself.
If you touch the gun, Michaela,
I'm gonna tell Annalise.
MICHAELA: I didn't say I was going to.
CALEB: What if I want to get rid of it?
Caleb!
Are you insane?
It's what makes the most sense.
CATHERINE: Caleb?
What are you doing?
WES: Maybe we should call Nate.
Why?
He fixed the Philip problem last time, and he'll know if the cops find the painting.
Nate's done enough for us.
Annalise.
Did you find Catherine?
Yes, but Michaela's on the phone.
What do I care?
I need Catherine.
That's why Michaela's calling.
Catherine ran away.
Someone start talking.
ANNALISE: You pick up the phone. Call me.
What you don't do is tamper with the one piece of evidence that could upend our entire case.
I wanted to call you.
We were worried about rule three point four.
It's not your job to worry.
It's your job to not sabotage me.
We can put it back.
And tamper with it twice?
That seem smart to you?
Where is she?
I don't know.
Are you lying to keep her safe?
No, I swear, I don't know what's going on with her.
You sure we shouldn't call Nate?
Philip Jessup has lived his entire life without getting so much as a speeding ticket.
But two days ago, he was gifted with a brand-new criminal record that looks remarkably like Scott Fuller's.
What the hell does that have to do with me?
This video shows you're in the station on your day off.
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
I just got my job back.
I'm trying to earn my keep.
Or maybe you were manufacturing a file on Philip Jessup for Annalise Keating?
Am I getting fired?
Relax, Lahey.
I'm relaxed.
I just don't appreciate being falsely accused of crimes I didn't commit.
It's kind of a sore spot for me.
I didn't fabricate anyone's record.
So, am I getting charged with something, or can I go?
Go.
You enjoy being her little boy toy, don't you?
That's why you keep running back to Annalise again and again.
So she can fight your battles for you?
You prefer to have her boss you around, tell you what to do, like hire her bestie and kill Nia?
Keep my wife's name out of your mouth!
Say her name again.
Say it!
And then what?
I was looking for Catherine and went into her studio.
She wasn't there, but the room was freezing, so I went over to the vent to see if I could feel any heat coming out.
And that's when I saw the gun.
Why didn't you ask
Catherine about it?
I was scared she'd admit it was hers.
How do we know that you didn't put the gun there yourself?
If it was mine, I'd have gotten rid of it a long time ago.
Not if you wanted to pin it on your sister.
I had nothing to do with this.
I mean, what if Philip did this?
Put the gun there to frame us.
Show it to him.
Do it.
You notice the painting in the background?
No, this is not possible.
Unfortunately, it is.
I can no longer represent both you and Catherine anymore.
Why not?
Because if what you're saying is true and you knew nothing of this gun or Philip, then you need a lawyer separate from Catherine.
Otherwise, it's a conflict of interest.
But neither of us did this.
Well, it looks like one of you did, and that person isn't you.
So do you want to get off for this, or should I tell
Catherine I'm all hers?
(LINE RINGING)
ANNALISE: Frank.
FRANK: Hey, see this
Judge Millstone stuff was leaked?
No, and I don't care.
Where are you?
Outside Philip's apartment.
They're taking him in right now.
So, Catherine's not with him?
No. Why?
She ran away.
What?
Caleb found a gun in her room, which is fine because we're no longer representing her.
What did you just say?
I don't have time to explain.
Just find Catherine before she does something stupid.
ASHER: Dad, please don't ignore me today.
Look, it's obvious
Sinclair's pissed
'cause I didn't testify, so she leaked this.
I'll try to fix it. Just...
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Please, Dad, call me back.
Hey.
Hey.
I didn't know if I should come, but I was just at the courthouse.
You heard about the leak.
It's freaking Sinclair, right?
Maybe. I just...
I'm so sorry for everything that's happened, Bon.
I just...
I need you to know that I'm gonna do everything I can to make it right.
What is it?
Your dad, Asher.
(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)
(LINE RINGING)
Are you at work?
NATE: Yeah.
Good.
I need to know what's going on with Philip.
They just brought him in for questioning.
I can't help you, Annalise.
I don't need you to do anything.
I'm about to get fired.
Why?
Sinclair suspects I messed with Philip's record.
There's no proof I did anything,
but I blew up at
her in front of
the whole station.
ANNALISE: I'm so sorry.
I got to go.
Nate.
Annalise, did you know about this?
Know about what?
Asher's dad killed himself.
ASHER: Chloe gets in at 8:00.
Uncle John and Aunt Teri get in first thing tomorrow.
They said they'll go to the funeral home with us, too.
Or I can go.
If you don't want to, you don't...
You don't have to go.
Mom, everything's gonna be okay.
Mom.
You don't seem very upset.
What?
You found out your father killed himself, and you've already moved on to funeral arrangements.
No, I...
I'm just trying to help.
Or you're just happy that your father got what he deserved.
I didn't do this.
Those articles all mentioned a gang-rape cover-up.
Because Sinclair leaked it.
Exactly.
But they only mentioned your father's name, not yours.
Seems convenient.
He loved you so much.
He defended you!
Mom...
He sacrificed his whole career to hide your disgusting secret.
Please.
You're in shock.
We both are.
We need each other right now.
You mean you need me right now.
I don't want anything to do with you.
Don't say that.
We always thought it would be Chloe.
She'd be the one to send us to our grave, but it turned out to be you.
And for what?
To protect that woman you work for?
This has nothing to do with Annalise.
Annalise...
That's what you call her.
Why did you choose her over us?
The people who loved you your entire life.
Because that's what your father did for you.
He loved you
when you were unlovable.
No!
(CRYING)
BONNIE: He's dead because of us.
No, he's dead 'cause he hanged himself.
Because of what we did. Annalise.
She sold his dirty secrets.
She didn't make him a corrupt ass in the first place.
Don't go telling doucheface any of that.
You already told him?
No.
But not to protect Annalise.
What the hell happened between you two?
We can't keep doing this, Frank.
We say we're just protecting ourselves, but there's a point when we're the ones people need to be protected from.
And that's who we've become.
Don't you see that?
You're upset and sad, and that's good 'cause it means you're still a person.
But right now is not the time to think too hard.
Catherine's on the lam.
Help me track her down.
You know you want to.
I have to go.
Get me all the dirt we have on Judge Millstone.
Bonnie, that means every file in the David Allen case.
Frank, find any evidence of malfeasance we can use against him.
BONNIE: You promised Asher you wouldn't do this.
Federal Judge Millstone.
There's enough evidence in there to charge him with multiple counts of corruption.
(CELLPHONE VIBRATES)
What is it?
We got another Sinclair problem.
CALEB: Please, Catherine.
You get to be mad at me, but you can't just run away.
You're smarter than that, so, please, come home.
Has anyone talked to Asher?
No one called him?
What would we say?
Sorry your dad was so shady that his only way out was to off himself?
Or we could just say, "sorry."
Thank you.
Of course you two agree.
You both also think it's okay to bang clients.
You slept with Caleb?
Keep your voice down!
When?
CONNOR: Last night.
Hey, did Caleb's penis do the trick and finally give you your big O?
That's why you were willing to hide the gun, right?
It's not his gun.
Hmm.
Who'd have thought that you and I would be the last ones on the screw-the-client train?
Okay, if no one else is gonna call Asher, I will.
Who has his number?
(SCOFFS)
We are officially the worst people ever.
(BREATHING RAGGEDLY)
Sit tight.
I'll call you back.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Tell me you're still at the house.
There's been a change of plans.
Sinclair's on her way over.
Why?
We got to tell her everything, that you found the gun and that Philip owns one of Catherine's paintings.
Why do we have to tell her anything?
Because we're representing you now,
Caleb, not Catherine.
And keeping evidence from Sinclair is only gonna make it look like you have something to hide.
So Michaela's gonna bring you back to her apartment, and I'm gonna walk
Sinclair through what happened myself.
But you have to leave right now.
What if Catherine comes home?
All the more reason for you not to be here.
She's gonna be upset, ashamed.
Now, I'll do my best to protect her.
I give you my word.
CALEB: I can't go.
You heard Annalise.
I can't sell out my sister without at least giving her a chance to explain.
Catherine sold you out the minute she didn't tell you she knew Philip.
Maybe she doesn't know him.
What about the gun?
She probably didn't know it was there.
Or she did and she was just scared and she still is, but I can't just abandon her like this.
What if I stay?
That way, I'll be here in case she comes back.
I'll take care of her.
Why are you still here?
Caleb was freaking out about leaving, so I told him I'd call him with updates.
It was the only way he'd leave.
(VEHICLE APPROACHES)
Someone's here.
It's Sinclair.
Nobody move.
Where are you going?
Just stand where you are!
Show me.
I'm so sorry.
Stop.
She did this to herself.
I'm so sorry.
Stop.
She did this to herself.
You enjoy being her little boy toy, don't you?
That's why you keep running back to
Annalise again and again.
So she can fight your battles for you?
You prefer to have her boss you around, tell you what to do, like hire her bestie and kill Nia?
Keep my wife's name out of your mouth!
I'm about to get fired.
Why?
Sinclair suspects
I messed with
Philip's record.
There's no proof I did anything,
but I blew up at
her in front of
the whole station.
ANNALISE: I'm so sorry.
NATE: I got to go.
SERGEANT JOSEPH: Well done.
Your little temper tantrum got Sinclair to file a harassment suit against you.
Now she fears for her life.
And I was nice to hire you back.
But now I've got no choice but to let you go.
Do I talk to you to file a discrimination claim against the D.A.'s office?
Excuse me?
I'd like to file a racial discrimination suit against Emily Sinclair.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)
EMILY: Thank you for coming.
Why am I here?
I want to bury the hatchet.
That's up to you.
I know...
Which is why
I'm offering to drop my harassment claim if you drop yours.
I may be a lot of things, but racist is not one of them.
That's what racists always say.
I've never been after you.
It's always been Annalise.
So help me put her behind bars.
Why would I want to do that?
Because she ruined your life, Nate.
And you?
Don't I have you to blame for that, too?
(DOOR CLOSES)
Detective Lahey. I mean,
Patrol Officer Lahey.
I'm sorry.
It's hard to keep up.
For you and me both.
(DOOR OPENS)
Go away.
ASHER: No. We need to talk.
There's nothing to talk about, Asher.
You couldn't just leave him alone, could you?
Stop following me, or I'll blow my rape whistle.
You made my father do this.
Is that what you think, that this is all my fault?
You started the corruption probe.
I did not.
The article mentioned a rape cover-up.
I know. You should be grateful they kept your name out of it.
What about my father, huh?
Huh? He's dead because of you!
What about Tiffany Howard?
Have you ever thought about her?
She may not be dead, Asher, but I'm sure she feels dead on the inside, and that's because of what your father did to her.
I don't know.
Maybe this is karma coming back to bite him in the ass.
God knows he deserved it.
What did you just say?
Your father was a bad man, Asher.
And honestly, you and a lot of people in this city are better off without him.
You got me all turned around.
(MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(TIRES SCREECH)
(EMILY GRUNTS)
(SHUDDERS)
Need some help?
No.
I mean, my brakes are busted, but AAA's coming.
Okay. Have a good night.
You too.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(CAR DOOR OPENS)
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)
Hi.
I can't look.
It's okay.
You don't have to.
Is she alive?
Please, tell me she's alive and we just need to call an ambulance.
Asher...
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Check her pulse.
I don't have to.
She's gone.
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I did that.
Hey.
You have to go.
Stop.
I need to call the police, and...
Listen to me.
I'm your lawyer, and I'm advising you not to do anything yet.
You just do what
I tell you, okay?
(SNIFFLES)
(CELLPHONE VIBRATES)
What is it?
We got another Sinclair problem.
She pulled me into her car, asked me to help take you down.
What did you tell her?
That I'd be an idiot to believe anything she says.
She's persistent.
Got to give her that.
You hear about Philip?
No.
They released him after questioning.
They have his DNA at the crime scene.
They need to arrest him.
Well, they didn't.
(CELLPHONE VIBRATES)
I'll call you back.
(BEEP)
Bonnie?
Sinclair's dead.
What?
Asher hit her with his car.
He called me to help.
He wants to go to the police.
But you know what'll happen if he does.
He's going to tell them everything, Annalise, that I killed Sam, that you made him not testify.
It'll all come out.
We'll go to jail.
What do I do, Annalise?
Just tell me.
Take him home, make it look like a hit-and-run, or I can call the police and tell them the truth,
but you need to tell me to do that.
Sit tight.
I'll call you back.
LAUREL: (ECHOING)
Asher's dad killed himself.
NATE: I'm about to get fired.
Sinclair suspects I messed with Philip's record.
I blew up at her in front of the whole station.
She pulled me into her car,
asked me to help take you down.
BONNIE: Make it look like a hit-and-run...
(DIALING)
Tell me you're still at the house.
Yeah, but I found Catherine.
She used her credit card at a motel outside Camden.
Good.
Go to my office right now.
What's going on?
Just go.
On the mantel above the fireplace,
inside the small vase.
Just get me the pills.
It's called secobarbital.
I take it, and I'm asleep, just like that.
Here.
Okay, you got to tell me what's going on.
Just take them with you.
How bad is it, Annalise?
Bad.
There's been a change of plans.
Sinclair's on her way over.
Why?
We got to tell her everything, that you found the gun and that Philip owns one of Catherine's paintings.
I can't just abandon her like this.
What if I stay?
That way, I'll be here in case she comes back.
Someone's here.
It's Sinclair.
Nobody move.
Where are you going?
Just stand where you are!
Show me.
I'm so sorry.
Stop.
She did this to herself.
(CAR DOOR OPENS)
Let's get her inside.
(FOOTSTEPS)
ASHER: I'm losing my grip.
(THUD)
Asher?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
What the hell?
Who is that?
Everyone, relax.
Tell us what's going on.
Who's in there?
Is that a body?
It's Emily Sinclair.
Someone killed her?
It doesn't matter.
I ran over her.
It was an accident.
And we're gonna make it look like even a bigger accident.
Why would we do that?
No, no, we should...
If it was an accident...
Just do what I say and ask questions later!
No.
This is insane.
You're insane.
I'm leaving.
They killed Sam, Asher.
What?
It wasn't Bonnie.
She just said that to protect them.
But Sam attacked Rebecca, and they killed Sam, and I've been covering for them the whole time.
And, now, they're gonna help cover for you.
Why are you doing this to us?
Because all of this, everything that's happened,
Sinclair coming after me, using Asher, now this.
It all started with what the four of you did!
Now, let's get to work!
ANNALISE: I called
Emily Sinclair here to show her the gun and this photo.
And that's when Catherine came home unexpected and killed Sinclair.
There is no way that anyone believes that.
And we don't even know that Catherine's guilty.
Well, you knew Nate was innocent, but you were still okay with me framing him.
We found a gun in her room, a photo connecting her to Philip.
Her own brother even believes that she did it.
You may not believe it, but I do, and I'm the expert, so you do what I say.
Catherine's not here, though.
That's being taken care of.
Taken care of how?
You mean kill her?
I didn't say that.
So Catherine ran over Sinclair here.
That's our story.
Our story doesn't matter.
Of course it does.
Otherwise, none of this makes sense.
We don't need it to make sense.
We just need it to look like chaos, to leave the police a crime scene that's a mess.
It's their job to make sense out of it, not ours.
EMILY: (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
This is Emily Sinclair.
Please, leave a message.
(BEEP)
Sinclair, this is
Annalise Keating.
I'm calling from the Hapstall mansion, and I need to speak to you immediately.
It involves evidence that
I've just been made aware of inside Catherine's studio.
Great.
Let's make ourselves more culpable by touching the body.
Shut up and lift.
(GRUNTS)
ANNALISE: So come right away.
Time is of the essence.
(BEEP)
(DIALING)
(RINGING)
FRANK: Hey.
Frank, it's me.
Do you have eyes on her?
Headed her way now.
How many pills do I give her?
Enough not to kill her.
So you don't know, either.
I can't figure this out on my own, Frank!
Okay, I got it. Just...
You sure about all this?
How is doubting me right now helping?
I'm just saying, there are other ways to protect doucheface.
I'm not trying to protect him.
I'm trying to protect Nate.
He blew up at Sinclair today, and his prints are all over that car.
So, please, just help me protect him.
(CELLPHONE VIBRATES)
Wes?
WES: You need to come to the Hapstall mansion.
We're here, and Annalise, she's trying to protect you, or she thinks she is.
She's lost it.
Slow down.
You're the only one that can stop her.
From what?
Emily Sinclair is dead.
I'm supposed to be in my apartment with Caleb.
It's not too late.
CATHERINE: (ON MACHINE)
This is Catherine Hapstall.
Please, leave a message.
(BEEP)
Catherine, it's Annalise.
(CELLPHONE BEEPS)
I know you're scared, but you've got to stop this.
I can't protect you unless you let me.
So give me a chance.
Stop.
Ugh!
BONNIE: Okay.
Take her arms.
No way.
I'm out.
Connor.
Look, you're just as sick as her.
That's clear now, but I'm not doing this.
Michaela, you've done this before.
Exactly.
I'm not doing it again.
ANNALISE: You're worried
what it all looks like,
Catherine, I know, but it's not as bad as it seems.
I can still fix this.
We should put it in the pool, right?
Your fingerprints, they're...
Even if we wipe it down a million times, bury it, there's still evidence all over it, but the chlorine could destroy all of it, and it'll take the police days to find it.
No. We're not doing anything.
It's a good idea.
Nate's on his way.
I called and told him everything.
Wes.
He'll know what to do.
He's a cop.
Exactly.
We need his help if this is gonna work.
She's not okay.
MICHAELA: Connor!
Get her legs.
CONNOR: If you don't want to come, then don't.
Okay, but just think for a second.
No more excuses.
We know better this time.
(DOOR OPENS)
Wait.
(DOOR CLOSES)
What do we do?
Stop them.
Stop!
Michaela, no.
(SCREAMS)
(BREATHING RAPIDLY)
ANNALISE: I know how you feel, Catherine,
'cause there's nothing scarier than being accused of something that you didn't do.
But that's why you need to come back to the house,
so you don't look guilty.
BONNIE: There is no decision here.
It was already made, and you agreed, so either get on board, or you're the next dead body out there.
Yeah.
Give it to me.
ASHER: This isn't gonna work.
The fall won't hide what I did.
I hit her.
Hard.
Like... I heard bones cracking, and it sounded different than when she hit the ground.
That was more like a splatter.
It's not gonna work.
Put him in the car.
I'll be right there.
ANNALISE: Running is what can hurt you right now, Catherine, so stop it.
Stop running.
Stop hiding.
And let me help you.
(ENGINE TURNS OVER)
(MUFFLED MOANING)
It's done.
I'll bring this to Frank.
Leave it.
But it needs to be with Catherine.
I said leave it.
Annalise...
It's all gonna work.
Get Asher out of here. Hurry.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
It's okay.
I need to pee.
I'll be right back.
Just a little higher.
Hey.
Where were you?
They have a car wash.
Does this ever work?
Faking a crime scene?
I mean, that's not something that actually works.
Sometimes.
Right.
CATHERINE: (ON MACHINE)
This is Catherine Hapstall.
Please, leave a message.
(BEEP)
Hey, are you at home?
'Cause I'm here.
Just...
Just let me know you're okay.
LAUREL: You don't have to do that.
I want to.
We're here all the time.
Our fingerprints should be on everything.
It doesn't matter, anyway.
This won't work.
ANNALISE: You're right.
It won't work unless we do something to make them believe it.
What are you doing?
(DIALING)
Who are you calling?
(CRYING) Help.
I've been shot.
This is Annalise Keating.
And my client,
Catherine Hapstall, she shot me.
I'm here at her house.
The A.D.A.'s here, too.
Please, hurry!
(SIGHS)
(CELLPHONE BEEPS)
Now, it'll work.
DISPATCH:
All units, be advised
we have an ADW at
536 Charter Lane.
Reporting party has been shot.
I repeat, R.P. has been shot.
EMS is en route.
All units follow.
Shoot me.
No.
I'm the woman who ruined your life, and I'll ruin Oliver's, too.
You've lost your mind.
Felony computer hacking, falsifying records, and that face...
The friends he'd make behind bars.
You don't go near him!
You just take this gun and shoot me!
Okay.
No!
Don't do it!
I know you're strong enough to do this.
Okay, I'll do it, I'll do it!
You're letting her get in your head!
Shoot me in the leg.
You can do this.
Connor! Please! Please!
Put the gun down!
MICHAELA: No! No!
Connor! No!
Shoot me!
Please, stop!
No! No! No! No!
No, please, no, no, no. No, no, no.
(SIGHS)
(VOICE BREAKING)
I hate you so much.
(GUN THUDS)
Michaela, think about your future, huh?
The plans you have for your life.
Stop this.
Do it or we go to jail!
I'm calling 911.
I'm telling them you lied!
You're fine!
Michaela, stop, please!
Take the gun,
Wes! Take it!
All right.
Come on.
In my leg, all right?
I'll be fine.
No.
You know that this makes sense.
Nate's coming.
I called him so he could help.
He's gonna be here any minute, but no one's shooting you.
MICHAELA: Connor!
Connor, please don't leave without me!
ANNALISE:
Laurel, you can do this.
You've been through worse with your father.
And you help us, always.
And I need for you to do it again.
Come on.
Come on.
(LAUREL GROANS)
Maybe we should go to jail...
For everything.
Maybe that's okay.
No.
Give me the gun.
No.
Rebecca's dead, Wes.
I made it up that she ran away.
She's been dead this whole time.
No, Wes, she's just saying that to make you do it.
When you were crying on my lap, every time you asked me, she's been dead the whole time.
I've been lying to you over and over.
Shoot me.
LAUREL: Wes, please don't do it.
Please, don't.
I deserve it.
Shoot me.
LAUREL: Wes, please!
Please, don't do it.
No!

FBI AGENT: Christophe.
We'll be done in just a little bit.
I just need you to tell me what you saw when you got home today.
Can you do that for me, Christophe?
You're not in trouble.
I already know you were the one who called 911, which was really smart.
Is she dead?
I don't know.
Because you're lying.
No.
I think you are.
You don't want to tell me because it's my mom, right?
You think I'm gonna freak out if I know she hurt herself.
FBI AGENT: I don't think you're gonna freak out.
All I know is they took her to the hospital.
CHRISTOPHE: Oh.
She looked dead when I found her.
Very dead.
Good God, Annalise.
What did we do?

ANNALISE: Previously on

(GRUNTS)
You just do what
I tell you, okay?
LAUREL: So Catherine
ran over Sinclair here.
That's our story.
ANNALISE: There's been a change of plans.
Leave the police a crime scene that's a mess.
We just need it to look like chaos.
(QUAVERING) This
is Annalise Keating.
And my client,
Catherine Hapstall, she shot me.
Shoot me. In my leg!
Rebecca's dead, Wes.
I've been lying to you over and over.
No! (GRUNTS)

What the hell is wrong with you?
Oh, my God.
You shot her?

MICHAELA: Oh, my God.
I had to.
That's not her leg.
I have never shot a gun before.
We have to go.
No, no, no.
We have to help her.
LAUREL: The cops are on their way, Wes.
Wes!
Give me the gun.
No!
I'll put it in the pool, like you said.
No.
I'll meet you by the gate.
Just let him do it.

We're home.
I don't want a nurse.
I don't want a stranger sleeping in my house.
It's for you.
No stairs, remember?
Now, let's get you set up with a Vicodin.
You can take another in six hours.
And you can't drink on the antibiotics, which you take two of each day along with the anti-inflammatory.
I wrote it all down for you.
(GRUNTS LIGHTLY)
Let me help you.
Oh, no, Bonnie.
(BREATHES SHARPLY)
When is the hearing tomorrow?
11:00.
I still think we can ask to push it.
Oh, no. I didn't go through all this to not testify.
Asher?
He's fine.
All the kids are.
Wes?
LAUREL: Annalise got out of the hospital this morning.
Wes, this is good.
It means she's gonna be okay.
Wes, it's all working.
You don't know that.
I do.
Annalise is home, and everyone thinks
Catherine is guilty.
Nate doesn't.
If Nate wanted to turn us in, he would have done it that night.
It's all gonna work.
BONNIE: Did you want me to bring him here?
Who?
Wes.
You seem concerned about him.
I'm concerned about all of us.
WES: I tried to kill her.
Because she lied to you.
She wasn't lying.
Rebecca isn't dead.
Annalise can tell you that herself when she's better.
And I'm just supposed to believe her?
(SIGHS)
I'm sorry.
I know you're just trying to help.
(SCOFFS) But what happened, what I did, there's no making that okay.
You think you're the only one this has been hard on?
Think about Asher, what he's going through right now.
If anyone deserves to be lying around in bed, it's him.
But he's not because he knows he's worse off without us.
And so are you.
So, stop feeling sorry for yourself and get up.
I said, "Get up!"
ANNALISE: You should go.
You're going to need to eat.
That's what delivery men are for.
Someone needs to change your bandages.
Listen, I have two hands.
Please.
Just... I don't want to have to beg for peace in my own home.
Go.

I will.

MALE REPORTER: (ON TV)
Catherine Hapstall
remains behind bars
ahead of
her preliminary
hearing tomorrow,
where she'll face
charges for the murder
of Emily Sinclair
and attempted murder of Annalise Keating.
Ms. Keating survived the gunshot wound,
and is expected to take the stand tomorrow
as the manhunt for Philip Jessup,
Miss Hapstall's
alleged accomplice,
continues,
with police reporting no sightings
since the night of Ms.
Sinclair's murder.
(SIGHS)
Oh, Bonnie.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Look who's back from the dead.
I promised him free food.
Tons. Made pizzas last night, tacos tonight.
LAUREL: Hey, there you are. Finally.
CONNOR: Wait list.
ASHER: Hey, bud.
You don't look too terrible.
CONNOR: Whole vibe's been off without your adorableness.
We were about to barge in on you at your apartment.
(LAUGHS)
Hey.
What's all this?
Uh, study group.
Exams are in a month, in case you forgot.
You mean, in case he's been distracted by all of the murders.
FRANK: Shh. Neighbors.
Wes, I made you copies of all our outlines.
Congrats on getting out of bed.
(DOOR OPENS)
Whiskey helps.
(DOOR CLOSES)
BONNIE: Wes, you're back.
What are you doing here?
Did they not release her?
Relax. She's home.
Alone?
She's doing great.
Stop worrying.
Welcome back.

Is anyone in there?
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
Please answer the door.
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
Hello?
(SOBBING) Please!
Oh, thank God.
You're the lawyer?
Yes.
(VOICE BREAKING) Thank God.
What's wrong?
My boy.
You have to take him.
(BABY CRIES)
What is this?
I saw you on the news.
I know.
You survived even after you were shot because you are strong.
And he needs you.
(CRYING CONTINUES)
(WOMAN SOBBING)
He needs you.
Stop this!
I'm not okay!
I'm not okay!
No. No, no, no. We'll call the police.
We'll call the police.
No. No. They'll send me away.
No, no.
You can take care of each other.
Don't leave.
No! Don't leave!
I can't! I can't!
I can't!
I said come back!
No! (BREATHES HEAVILY)
(WATER RUNS)
(DOOR OPENS)
Asher.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I just haven't heard from them yet.
From who?
From the cops. Who else?
DESK OFFICER: Can I help you?
ASHER: Yeah.
I need to make a statement.
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
And they found him in his chambers, which makes it obvious.
I mean, who does that at work?
Suicides are quite common at work.
Okay. Well, my dad wouldn't do that.
So you need to investigate, see if the scene was staged, see if there's any signs of a struggle, because I'm telling you my dad was murdered.
It's been two weeks.
No one's returning my phone calls.
They're probably still gathering evidence.
Or they think I'm crazy.
Look, as soon as
Catherine's hearing is over,
I will call the station and see where they're at.
Thanks.
Why are you enabling him?
Maybe he's right.
He's not.
And maybe having him talk to the police isn't the greatest idea right now.
He isn't gonna tell them anything.
How do you know that?
Because he isn't the type to betray the people who protect him.
Oh, meaning I am?
(CELLPHONE RINGING)
Is everything okay?
(DOOR CLOSES)
BONNIE: Annalise?
(WHISPERING) I finally got it to calm down.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Take it, Bonnie.
Just calm down.
Take it.
(SHAKILY) The Mahoney trial preps tomorrow, and now this?
(BREATHLESSLY) Oh, God.
If it cries, just take it upstairs.
I need quiet if I'm gonna finish my opening on time.
We're locking the door now?
Did you bring them?
Yeah.
ANNALISE:
Go to my office right now.
Just promise me you're not gonna use them to kill her.
Frank...
Like that's a crazy question anymore.
At least let me see her.
She's high on Vicodin and walking around with no pants.
What about the hearing?
She can't testify.
She has to.
Annalise ain't feeling too hot, so she's not gonna take the stand tomorrow.
We don't have a case against Catherine if she doesn't.
Tell her to get her lazy ass out of bed.
Relax. Frankie's got a plan B.
We're gonna write up a witness statement the prosecution can use instead.
Except that's hearsay and inadmissible.
It will work for the purposes of prelim.
Proves a prima facie case.
Here we go. Let's be Annalise.
My...
Student...
Michaela...
You can talk faster.
Pratt, called to inform me that Caleb Hapstall had found the gun in Catherine's studio.
I called Sinclair to the house so that
I could show her all the evidence connecting Catherine to Philip.
There's been a change of plans. Sinclair's on her way over.
ANNALISE: We got to tell her everything.
Sinclair arrived around 10:00 p.m.
Who is that?
ANNALISE:
There is an eyewitness.
Her name is Rose Edmond.
And she's a cleaning lady, so she's probably gonna want some money to testify.
Ice cream?
And I don't want to give her a check because then it's gonna leave a paper trail, so...
Have Frank get some cash and tell him to come over here.
CONNOR: Catherine was talking in circles.
I tried to talk her down, but she knew that we'd discovered her relationship with Philip.
And by the time I saw her reach for the gun, it was too late.
She shot me before I knew what was going on.
The cleaning lady has a son, and that's probably why she doesn't want to testify
'cause she's scared for him.
Annalise?
How's the baby?
Oh, God. I thought if it didn't stop crying,
I might smother him.
Ugh.
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
What's wrong?
Did you do something to him?
There is no baby, Annalise.
No. Uh-uh.
Bonnie... I told you there was a woman at the door, and that she was hysterical, and she put the baby in my arms, and I didn't want the baby.
No, it was in your head.
Like last time.
You're messing with me.
The next thing I remember is being in the hospital.
Is she okay? Tell me!
Is she gonna be okay?
SURGEON: Get him out of here!
ORDERLY: Sir...
FRANK: When I woke up,
the police told me they'd found Catherine in the woods,
and she had blood on her.
Is that it? We're done?
Yeah. Just run a little spell check, and...
(SIGHS)
What'd I tell you?
Typing skills like a boss.
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
A written statement of this caliber is hearsay.
That's up to the judge.
Exactly. Which means she can reject it.
I can't push the hearing again.
Do I have to subpoena Annalise?
'Cause I will.
That would be a mistake.
Not putting my star witness on the stand is a bigger mistake.
Your star witness who is high on pain pills and hallucinating.
You don't have any other choice.
Get the judge to accept it.
(SCOFFS)
(SNORING)
(BABY CRYING)
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
I can't trust you to do anything.
(CRYING CONTINUES)
(EXCLAIMS)
(CRYING LOUDLY)
(BREATHING SHAKILY)
What do you want?
I don't know what this means.
I'm not your mother.
I don't...
You've got to tell me what you want.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
You're late.
I came as fast as I could.
Hurry, before Bonnie gets back.
Sorry I took so long.
I was at dinner.
I don't care.
How is he?
(SIGHS)
(SIGHS)
(SNIFFLES)
Hi.
(WEAKLY) Sit.
Why'd you do it?
You told them that you did it.
(SIGHS) Uh...
I don't know. I just...
I got scared.
And they already blame Wes for Sam.
And he would just fall apart if they blamed him for this, too.
So...
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
What is it?
What you said about Rebecca, is it true?
I just said that to provoke him.
Don't worry.
Keep watching him.
(MONITOR BEEPING)
ANNALISE: How is he?
He's good.
Better.
Better how?
He left his apartment this morning.
And you think that makes him better?
I don't know. I just...
Then don't make things up!
I need you to tell me how he actually is, not how we want him to be!
Okay. I'm sorry.
How are you feeling?
Fine.
Good.
'Cause we all got a little bit nervous when Bonnie said that you couldn't testify.
What did Bonnie say?
I'm calling him now.
I wouldn't do that.
You think a few weeks of me being laid up in the hospital makes you the boss now?
You don't remember, do you?
Remember what?
There was a baby, Annalise.
I'd be a terrible lawyer if I let you anywhere near a courtroom right now.
You know that.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Fine.
But let me read through the statement.
Are you hungry?
I can heat up soup.
Bonnie.
Nate.
Did he call?
Give him a few more days.
Soup sounds good.
Throw these out.
WOMAN: (ON TV) How do you
explain Catherine's
secret relationship
with suspect Philip Jessup?
My sister has made it
very clear that Philip
approached her
before she knew he was related to our aunt.
She had no idea who he was at the time.
WOMAN: But phone records show
Catherine and Philip talked
after she found out this information.
Because Mr. Jessup
was setting up Catherine
as a scapegoat.
If anything, the fact that he's now missing
proves he's the one who
should be on trial here,
not my client.
Mr. Jessup is the mastermind of every single heinous crime
committed against the Hapstall family.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
The fact that
the police have enlisted
the FBI in their manhunt...
LAUREL: Wes!
Proves just
what a dangerous
and powerful individual
law enforcement officials believe...
Wes, you okay?
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
Wes?
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)
You missed taco night, so I brought you a burrito.
You should really call first.
Why?
'Cause there might be a girl in here or something?
Hey, bromo, do you have any Jay Z or something not so stereotypically gay?
They're my records.
They should be gay.
Right.
How much longer till he leaves?
His dad just died.
Be nice.
He doesn't seem that upset.
Yeah, well, he's doing a pretty good job of hiding it.
Uh, we're out of bourbon.
This is scotch.
(GROANS) Oh. Scotch.
Weird. This was my dad's drink.
Gave me my first sip when I was 11.
Not the first law he broke.
Um, so, about that,
I just wanted to say, I'm sorry.
My friend in high school...
She wasn't my friend.
She was in my grade.
Anyway, she killed herself by jumping off this...
My dad didn't kill himself.
Police say he did, but I think someone killed him and covered it up.
It happens all the time.
It does?
Why don't we play a video game?
You hate video games.
Yeah, but, Asher, you like them, right?
Yeah.
CONNOR: Yeah. (LAUGHS)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Hi.
NATE: I got shot once.
Did I tell you that?
Bullet passed through my thigh.
It still hurt like hell.
Bonnie make you come?
I would have got here sooner, but work's been rough.
Oh, please.
Don't make excuses.
I never wanted you involved.
I know.
We can blame Wes for that.
WES: You need to come to the Hapstall mansion.
Annalise... She's trying to protect you.
NATE: What the hell are you doing?
Oh, my God. Is that...
Get in the car.
You could have just drove them to the station that night.
You protect me, I protect you.
Hard to believe.
Only 'cause you're you.
No.
What happened to you, Annalise?
(ECHOING) I've known some unhappy people in my life, been one at times.
But what you did...
Did you want to die?
Because it's hard to want to be around someone who does that.
I want to know you, I do, but not this way.
I'm tired.
Can you please go?
Right.
Nate, I'm sorry.
(INHALES SHAKILY)
Sorry. I just...
You know me.
You do.
(SMACKS LIPS)
I'll check in later this week.
Get better.
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)
You two had a slumber party last night, and you two had a three-way with Oliver.
Okay, careful with what you're insinuating.
And no one thought to call me and see how I was doing?
LAUREL: Michaela.
No, I have a right to be mad.
It's Caleb. He's...
You got this.
Hi.
Hi.
CALEB: How is she?
Good.
Sinclair got there and sent us away, but Annalise is...
What do you mean?
Then how do you know Catherine's good?
I meant Annalise.
Why do I care about Annalise?
Catherine never came back as far as I know, but...
As far as you now?
The only reason
I left is so you'd take care of her.
I know. I know.
I wanted to stay, but
Sinclair made us leave.
Annalise has this, though.
(CELLPHONE RINGS)
Hello?
WOMAN: Is this
Caleb Hapstall?
Yes. Who's this?
Officer Crawford
at the Philadelphia
Police Department.
I'm surprised you had the nerve to show up.
I came to support Annalise.
She almost died that night.
I agree. That part of her story's true.
I can't imagine what you must be going through right now.
Don't pretend to have sympathy.
Catherine did this.
Caleb, you might not be able to see that because she's your sister and you love her, but it happened.
And that's not my fault.
I'm sorry if you feel like it is, but hating me isn't going to fix anything.
Please. (BREATH SHAKING)
I want to be here for you, but you have to let me.
You all belong in hell.
DISPATCHER: 911.
What's your emergency?
ANNALISE: (QUAVERING) Help.
I've been shot.
DISPATCHER:
Repeat that, ma'am.
This is Annalise Keating.
And my client,
Catherine Hapstall,
she shot me.
I'm here at her house.
The A.D.A.'s here, too.
Please, hurry!
Your Honor, in addition to Ms.
Keating's 911 call, the prosecution would like to submit a written testimony.
Objection! Ms. Keating is supposed to be here to testify in person.
The witness is still recovering from her gunshot wound, and the 911 call alone is enough to send this to trial, Judge.
I'm not so sure that's true, Mr. Denver.
Objection sustained.
Excuse me.
If you want Ms. Keating's testimony in this hearing, she will have to testify.
Move on to your next witness, Mr. Denver.
(SPECTATORS MURMUR)
DR. TAKAHAMO: Injuries like Ms. Sinclair's are consistent with a fall, but there are other points of impact in the evidence which lead me to conclude that the body was struck prior to the fall.
DR. TAKAHAMO:
Perhaps if the defendant previously attacked her with an object...
Did you call her?
Hell no.
LAUREL: The judge
just threw out
your statement.
What do we do?
Nothing. I'll be right there.
But...
(DIAL TONE)
What the hell is she thinking?
Then multiple fractures could be explained.
Your Honor, Ms.
Keating is here.
I'm well enough to testify.
Judge, she's on mind-altering painkillers.
I'm not any longer.
You could test my blood if you want to, but I'm fine to take the stand.
DENVER: And according to your statement, Ms. Keating, it was after your meeting with Ms. Sinclair that Catherine Hapstall entered the house?
I never heard her come in.
Ms. Sinclair noticed her first.
But when I first saw Catherine, I knew something was wrong.
Wrong how?
Her pupils were dilated.
Her expression was vacant.
There was clearly something physically wrong.
Objection! Ms. Keating is not qualified to make a medical diagnosis.
Sustained.
DENVER: What happened next, Ms. Keating?
Catherine had a gun.
She pointed it at me.
I yelled at her to stop, as did Ms. Sinclair.
Um...
DENVER: That's when
Catherine pulled the trigger?
(BABY CRYING)
Ms. Keating?
(CRYING CONTINUES)
DENVER: Your Honor, you can see for yourself, this is clearly too much for Ms. Keating right now.
JUDGE SANSBURY: Ms. Keating?
Are you all right?
Yes. Yeah.
I just need a recess, then I'll be fine.
Let's resume in 15 minutes.

(TOILET FLUSHES)
You can't do this.
(SIGHS) I already am.
Okay, this isn't just about you.
(SIGHS) Like I need to be reminded.
Now is not a good time, Wes.
I don't care.
Bonnie's right.
They're waiting for me.
ROBIN:
I have a simple question
for you, Ms. Keating.
If it were that simple, I suspect you would have asked me already.
ROBIN: So, your testimony is that my client shot you, and somehow
Emily Sinclair wound up dead?
That's what happened.
Even though
Ms. Sinclair's body shows clear inconsistencies with a death from a fall?
Ask your forensic experts about that.
But aren't you claiming that Catherine Hapstall chased Emily Sinclair onto the roof of the Hapstall mansion?
No. I've claimed that I don't know what happened after I got shot.
Did you see Catherine Hapstall chase after Ms. Sinclair?
Again, I didn't see anything.
(CHUCKLING) Excuse me?
The only reason we're all here is because you say you saw my client shoot you.
Yes.
That's true. I...
I only...
You only what?
Want to keep changing your story?
Objection! Argumentative.
Because I think what you just said, that you didn't see anything that night, is the only honest thing you've said up there today.
DENVER: Your Honor, counsel is badgering the witness.
If she doesn't have a question, we should move on.
ROBIN: Here's a question.
Ms. Keating, aren't you lying?
(EXHALES) I don't know.
You don't know?
Then how can we trust anything that you think you saw or heard that night, including your claim that Catherine
Hapstall shot you?
She didn't.
ROBIN: I'm sorry?
Repeat yourself,
Ms. Keating.
She didn't do it.
What did you say?
Your Honor,
Ms. Keating is not fit to sit here.
Catherine didn't do it.
Catherine Hapstall didn't shoot you that night?
No. No, no, no.
I meant, Catherine didn't shoot her parents.
What?
Your Honor.
Catherine didn't kill her parents.
She told me when
I represented her.
That's what I'm saying.
CONNOR: What the hell?
She just broke privilege.
ROBIN: Your Honor,
Ms. Keating just violated her oath to keep secret communications between her and her client in private.
DENVER: Ms. Keating is unwell.
Which means that none of this testimony is admissible anymore.
I therefore demand that you strike both Ms. Keating's written and spoken testimony from the record.
You're welcome.
You think because you lost it in court,
I'm here to kiss your ass?
I think you ought to thank me for just saving
Catherine's life.
Everything I just said on the stand is gonna make Catherine out to be the victim.
She was disoriented, out of it, all because of Philip.
(DOOR OPENS)
What's wrong?
I need you to do something.
Philip killed your parents. We know that.
But then he did everything he could to pin it on your sister.
He put the gun in her room, befriended her before she knew who he was, and then he drugged her that night.
I didn't shoot anyone, Caleb!
No, you don't remember shooting anyone.
What?
You knew Philip before.
He found me on purpose. I didn't know who he was then.
Think about how all that sounds.
I don't care how it sounds!
But you need to.
None of this is about what's right or wrong.
It's about what a jury's going to believe during a trial.
And you? What do you believe?
ANNALISE: It's the only way to save her.
No prosecutor wants to take down Patty Hearst.
They want to take down her kidnapper.
CALEB: It doesn't matter what I think.
Because you think I did this.
I just want what's best for you.
I don't think I believe that anymore.
CALEB:
She didn't shoot anyone.
I was there, Caleb.
I know what happened.
And I can't get up on the stand, after swearing on the Bible, and lie about that.
Catherine shot me.
JUDGE SANSBURY: In the matter
of the Commonwealth versus
Catherine Hapstall, and the consideration of whether enough evidence has been presented to proceed to trial,
I have made my decision.
CATHERINE: Wait.
(SNIFFLES)
I have something
I'd like to say, Your Honor.
Sit down right now.
I remember things from that night that
I didn't before, and I'd like to go on record with them.
ROBIN: Your Honor, my client is...
Is trying to make a statement before the court, so let her.
JUDGE SANSBURY: The defendant can waive her right to remain silent.
I shot Annalise Keating.
(SPECTATORS MURMURING)
JUDGE SANSBURY: Order!
But I was drugged by someone, and I remember who that is now.
(WHIMPERING)
It was Philip Jessup.
Please strike what my client just said, and let the record note that she was not under oath for any of that.
This has been an inadmissible statement.
Your Honor, I demand that we recess so that I can properly confer with my client, who is...
(SNIFFLES)
Clearly, she is mentally incompetent right now.
(CAR ALARM CHIRPS)
The D.A. is going to offer Catherine a deal.
Five years, minimum security, if she testifies against Philip.
Okay. Please, Annalise.
No. It's not your job to worry about me.
Yeah, I do, though.
And you don't know what it's like to see you this way.
No, it's the pills.
I'm not talking about that.
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
You wanted to die that night.
ANNALISE: Leave it.
Annalise.
It's all gonna work.
It's why you sent me away.
You knew I wouldn't let you do it if I was there.
Well, you left anyway.
It's what you wanted, isn't it?
Have me gone.
I was angry and upset.
You know that.
I don't know anything anymore.
Those are my keys.
My suture ruptured.
I'm bleeding.
I need to go see a doctor.
Okay, I'll drive you.
I'll drive myself, okay?
I just need my keys.

WES: Hey, it's Wes.
You know what to do.
(BEEP)

FRANK: Calling the puppy?
He's not answering.
What is it?
Nothing.
Laurel.
We didn't call Asher that day.
No one had his number.
But if we did, if one of us would have talked to him, none of this would have happened.
Hey.
You got to let that stuff go.
Just put it away.
(SNIFFLES)
'Cause from this point forward, we all got each other's backs.
That includes yours.
Okay?
(CHUCKLES)
(SIGHS) Let's go eat.
(CHUCKLES)
ANNALISE: Hello?
Who's there?
CONNOR: Oh, my God.
I could eat this every day.
LAUREL: Seriously.
I am so full.
CONNOR: Yeah.
Pasta game's strong, Frankie D.
Well, it's not just pasta.
It's the famous Delfino ziti.
Hey. Hey!
(LAUGHTER)
A toast.
BONNIE: Wait for me.
Just make it strong.
We won for today.
Salud.
Salud.
MICHAELA: Salute.
ANNALISE: Hello?
Wes?
No. No.
No. No!
What are you doing here?
I searched everywhere.
The entire house.
But all I found were those pills.
I get it now, why my mom did it.
I never did before, but she just needed to make it all stop.
So do I.
You said "Christophe."
You knew my mother, didn't you?
(CHILDREN SHOUTING)
CHRISTOPHE: Home run!
Yes!
BOY: Yes!
WES: You knew her, and that's why I'm here.
Why I got in off the wait list.
Because you knew who I was.
You didn't tell me because there's a story there.
Hi.
Hello. (CHUCKLES)
You have to take him.
I can't! I can't!
I said come back!
ANNALISE: May I sit?
Of course.
You need to rest those feet.
Yes.
A boy, right?
Oh. How'd you know?
You're carrying low.
(CHUCKLES)
Oh.
I'm terrified of boys.
You'll be fine. (CHUCKLES)
That's mine over there, in the blue.
Another hit for the win!
He's adorable. (LAUGHS)
At times.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
I'm Rose.
Annalise.
Batter, batter.
Go. Go, go, go!
You got this!
So, tell me what you know.
You have to go.
I'm not leaving.
I can't have you here.
You're fine now.
You got up on that stand and proved that.
So, tell me what you know.
Tell me.
Tell me.
Tell me, damn it!
You think I want to hurt you?
(BREATHLESSLY) I think...
I think you ruined me.
Get out.
Wes, wait.
Wes.

ANNALISE: Previously on
How to Get Away With Murder...
Is that...
I found it here last week.
If what you're saying is true and you knew nothing of this gun or Philip, you need a lawyer separate from Catherine.
We're out of bourbon.
This is scotch.
How much longer till he leaves?
ANNALISE: (WHISPERING)
I finally got it to calm down.
You don't remember, do you?
Remember what?
BONNIE: There was a baby.
I'm Rose.
Annalise.
You said, "Christophe."
You knew my mother.
So, tell me what you know.
Tell me, damn it!
Get out.
(ANNALISE RETCHING)
(TOILET FLUSHES)
NOAH: So, you just want to ignore the client numbers?
XAVIER: Exactly.
That's why I'm organizing them by last name.
KENNEDY:
Wait, I thought we were organizing these by year.
No, we file cases alphabetically.
ANNALISE: You're both wrong.
Professor Keating, good morning.
How's that bump doing?
You don't get to me ask that.
I said whoever pulled my last court catalog should oversee my filings.
Who is that?
BONNIE: That's me.
I thought we should file alphabetically while keeping the client numbers sequential based on when they came to the firm.
From now on, ask
Ms. Winterbottom if you're confused.
Clearly, she's the only one who listens.
Great teamwork there.
ANNALISE: Sam?
(DOOR OPENS)
What are you doing?
I got grease on my shirt.
No patient trusts a messy therapist.
(CHUCKLES)
You hungry?
Ugh. I can't.
Oh. Again?
I think it's dead and it's my body trying to warn me.
Okay, he is not dead.
He just wants to make sure we know he's coming.
What?
I have to go to Ohio again.
I'm leaving Wednesday, coming back first thing
Thursday morning.
Well, the ultrasound is Wednesday.
I rescheduled it.
Annie...
I moved it closer.
It's tomorrow.
See? I care.
(SIGHS)
Don't marry a lawyer.
DOCTOR: Your edges are clear.
No signs of infection.
Don't tell me you're gonna make me go back to work.
I thought you'd be chomping at the bit to get back.
Bed's been nice.
You've been spending a lot of time sleeping?
Shouldn't I be?
DOCTOR: Of course, but if there's something else going on...
No, I'm just having trouble sleeping.
Uh, exams are coming, so I've been stressed.
How many hours are you getting?
Uh, two, three.
That must make it really hard to function during the day.
Yeah, which is why I'm here.
ANNALISE: I've just
had too much time
to think, to be honest.
I'll be fine.
DOCTOR: I get that, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't at least present the option of seeing someone.
WES: No, I'm not here for that.
You're here for sleeping pills, I know.
Sadly, this isn't a dispensary.
Okay, but I'm a One-L, and I really don't...
You don't have time for therapy.
I said the same thing when I was in med school.
ANNALISE: I've done enough therapy in my life.
DOCTOR: So, you already have a number to call in case you need to talk to someone?
He's dead. (SNIFFLES)
And I have to go to court for a plea hearing today, so...
Don't worry,
I'll be back in bed in time for my stories.
I can't just give you pills and never see you again.
Is there someone more senior I can talk to then?
I am the resident on call, which means my opinion is the one that matters here.
Fine, I'll go.
Sir...
Just don't feel bad if I end up shooting myself.
I wish you hadn't just said that.
I'm sorry. I'm just tired.
I've been needing...
I know.
But now we can't let you leave.
(SNORING)
Again?
We were studying and decided to get a drink.
OLIVER: A drink or ten?
I was good, but he...
He just needs someone to talk to right now.
OLIVER: That's my favorite throw pillow.
(PLATES CLATTER)
No! Don't touch it!
Breakfast, bud.
You hungry?
Yeah.
(GRUNTS) What's shaking, bacon?
Oh, you know, just enjoying the morning with my two favorite guys.
Oh, you know what I have to say to that?
(FARTS)
Oh, come on.
(LAUGHS)
Dude.
Did she specifically ask for us to come?
It's her first case back, of course she wants you here.
So, that's a no.
Stop worrying, it's going to be fine.
(SIGHS) It never is when you say that.
Where's Wes?
I don't know.
He didn't answer when I called.
You didn't knock on his door?
No, I didn't knock on his door.
We were already late and I didn't want to miss the showdown.
See, I'm not the only one who thinks she hates us.
She doesn't hate any of you.
Not even Laurel?
I mean, she should.
Enough. Just...
Be nice when she gets here.
But not too nice, you know she'll hate that.
Here she comes.
She hates us.
Good. The feeling is mutual.
Why are they here?
To help on the case.
He's already pleaded guilty.
What do I need help with?
You made it.
Of course I did.
I know, I just...
You took it in the gut.
That's the suffer shot.
If you really wanna make them feel it.
Interesting you should know that.
BAILIFF: All rise!
Be seated.
This is a plea hearing for Jason Murray, charged for the second degree murder of Tyler Robinson.
It's my understanding that the prosecution and defense have already come to an agreement...
An agreement you need to refuse to accept,
Your Honor.
My name is Joyce Robinson and the defendant shot and killed my son, Tyler.
And as the victim's mother,
I deserve to have a voice in these proceedings.
I'm sorry, Ms. Robinson, but this is not the forum to speak...
I've tried speaking with both A.D.A. Leigh and Ms. Keating about my wishes, and neither of them have taken the time to hear me out, so I...
Your Honor,
Ms. Robinson came to me requesting a restorative justice hearing.
What's a restorative justice hearing?
LEIGH: I informed her this alternative cannot be considered under a murder charge.
JUDGE: The A.D.A. is correct, Ms. Robinson.
Restorative justice is reserved for cases with far less severe charges.
JOYCE: But why?
If the victim's family want the court to offer the defendant another option...
What other option?
Your Honor, my client has already agreed to a quite lengthy sentence, 15 years, and it would be unfair to allow the victim's family to now hijack this process.
But what if I want a shorter sentence for Jason?
Clearly, this is a ploy to fool my client into rejecting this deal.
Not to mention, any shorter sentence would be a slap in the face to the actual victim.
You mean, a slap in the face to you because you'll look soft on crime, right?
And you?
I'd think you'd jump at the chance to get a better deal for Jason.
That's true.
Let's say I want that.
Your Honor, if
Ms. Robinson tried to contact me, I apologize.
As you know,
I've been in recovery.
JUDGE: But not discussing this option with your client veers dangerously close to ineffective assistance of counsel.
I have to stand up for Ms. Keating here.
How?
I mean, as you said, this is not a viable option.
LEIGH: That doesn't make any sense.
JUDGE: Enough.
I'm postponing this plea and ordering you all to hold a restorative justice hearing before any deal is reached.
This is a waste of time and money.
LEIGH: Again, this is a murder case.
Do you both want to be held in contempt?
Ms. Robinson, let me know if you have any more problems.
You want something to do?
Prep our client for this stupidity.
It could be good, though.
He could get a better deal.
Or a worse deal.
The woman is in shock and is gonna turn on
Jason the minute she gets in front of him.
Where are you going?
To take a nap.
FRANK: No, seriously, it's, uh, Judy or Ruth.
Ethelle?
KENNEDY: (CHUCKLES)
You can look it up.
It's the name on my birth certificate.
No way.
I refuse to believe anyone's parents actually name their kid Kennedy.
Call my mother.
She'll tell you the whole story behind it.
Wow. You already want me to meet your mom?
(CHUCKLES) Shut up.
I didn't say that.
(DOOR OPENS)
ANNALISE: Frank.
Where are the articles
I asked for?
On the Mahoney case?
Oh, I put them on your desk this morning.
What?
You sure you don't want me to come?
You might need back-up.
I've defended scarier people.
What flight did you book me on?
Oh. I thought I was supposed to wait for the doc to give you the okay to fly.
Sam told you not to book it?
You work for me.
You get confused,
I'll find a new secretary.
Assistant.
I'll call you what you want when you stop rubbing up on the interns.
Don't deny it.
Just think with your big head instead of your little one from now on.
Go.
(GASPS)
LAUREL: You're where?
WES: The psych ward.
I screwed up and...
Just don't tell anyone.
Okay, I won't, but Wes, what...
Just come and get me.
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
That your other boyfriend?
(CHUCKLES) Wes. He's home sick and needs a copy of our CivPro outline.
We got work.
Annalise doesn't care about this case, so why should I?
Cover for me with Bonnie?
You owe me.
Come up with something.
We'll see what we can work out.
BONNIE: Where's Laurel?
Lady doctor.
What, you give her a UTI?
Here I thought all the crap that's happened might make you grow up.
Okay, the hearing's set for tomorrow.
First, Joyce will make her statement, then Jason.
They'll detail their experience of the crime and how it's affected them.
In an ideal world, both the victim and the defendant feel healed and the world's a better place.
When in reality,
Joyce is just getting to be judge and jury.
It's what the judge wants.
And since you believe so much in this process, you get to prep Jason with me.
JASON: I had heard about
Tyler for a while.
He'd been running his mouth to his friends about wanting to bang my girlfriend,
Summer, which he did.
So, I went to confront him at the body shop he worked at.
I just wanted to scare him.
But he came at me and the gun...
It went off.
Is that when you stole Tyler's phone?
What?
BONNIE: Tyler's phone was never recovered at the scene, even though he made several calls right before.
I didn't touch his phone.
I just ran right after my gun went off.
I didn't even know I hit him.
And why bring your gun unless you plan to shoot the kid?
ASHER: 'Cause he's a freaking gangbanger.
He's been arrested for possession of firearms, breaking and entering.
No way this mom actually wants to forgive him.
You never know.
The heart works in mysterious ways.
JASON: I've wanted the
chance to apologize
for a long time now.
To look the people I hurt in the eye and...
Okay, you looking at me like that is distracting.
BONNIE: Joyce might look at you even worse.
You just need to push through, impress upon her how sorry you are.
Okay.
I got this.
MICHAELA:
I agree with Annalise.
This is a waste of time.
Seriously. Lipstick this pig all you want, the dude just snapped.
Frank.
Whatever. People snap, it's no biggie.
LAUREL: You promise you didn't say anything?
I just told her I was stressed.
But not 'cause of anything specific?
No.
I'm not actually crazy, she just thinks I am.
Well, I don't blame her.
You look awful.
'Cause I haven't slept!
Hi. I heard we had a family member here.
Oh, I knew they weren't gonna let me in, so I said we were adopted, but I was lying.
I'm his girlfriend.
How long have you been dating?
Uh, eight months?
Yeah. We met in study group.
Wow.
What?
DOCTOR: Nothing.
It's just if I had a boyfriend of eight months joke about committing suicide,
I'd want him to get professional help.
No, I do.
You don't.
And I very much question the health of your relationship if you can't see this is for Wes's benefit.
We could sue you for a wrongful diagnosis, or file an injunction with the judge to get him released.
DOCTOR: True.
But as law students, you should know that involuntary holds are only reviewable by the court after the 120-hour hold.
So, why don't you leave?
Let me chat with Wes, and see if we can get to know each other better.
LAUREL: Wes went to
the health center to
get some sleeping pills and they checked him into the psych ward instead.
He's fine.
He hasn't said anything, but I'm nervous he's gonna crack if he stays in there too long.
He's in good hands.
You want to just leave him in there?
Why not?
He'll sleep, get waited on hand and foot.
Believe me,
I might check myself in, too.
You can't just punish him like this.
Excuse me?
You're mad at him, and I get that, but he just did what you asked.
And you should see him.
He's a mess.
He just needs you to forgive him.
You're fired.
My old Bonnie's back, so I don't need you anymore.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
BONNIE: It's me.
Come in.
Laurel was just leaving.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Are you here to bug me about Jason?
No. About Caleb.
He's downstairs.
CALEB: I didn't want to come here.
I swear I didn't.
It's just...
Your new lawyer isn't me.
The police won't tell us anything about Philip, if they know where he is...
You think I do?
You found him the first time.
But he didn't think there was a reason to hide.
Okay, but if we work together on this, we can help each other.
Your sister shot me.
I almost died. How the hell can you help me?
She was drugged.
And the person responsible for all this, killing my parents, Sinclair, shooting you, he's still free.
Please, Annalise.
I wouldn't be here if I had another choice.
You need to go.
No. I need your help.
It's not my job to take care of you anymore.
Leave.
MICHAELA: Caleb?
What happened?
It doesn't matter.
Annalise is still really sick, so if she said something...
What do you need?
Maybe I can help.
Did she teach you how to do this?
How to act the whore in order to play people?
You're the whore.
Excuse me?
You waited until after you screwed me to show me that gun.
And I fell for it, even thought about breaking the law for you because I thought I knew you.
But I don't, do I?
You're right.
I just wanted to get laid.
I'm glad we could clear that up.
Mahoney's alibi is still in play.
If subpoenaed, refusal is evident.
Might have to file a motion for judge to grant immunity under the Fifth Amendment.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
I finished organizing the new case files.
Did you want me to start work on last year's?
I thought you all had class?
We do.
The others left, but it doesn't start for another half hour, so I figured...
Sciatica?
Oh...
Well, maybe it's just this baby's too damn big.
Have you tried lying on your side?
(SIGHS) No. Why?
It helps sometimes.
What the hell. (CHUCKLES)
Oof.
(SIGHS)
I'll go.
No, no, no, no.
Stay. Talk to me.
(SIGHS) How's it going with Sam?
Don't worry, he'd never tell me anything you discuss.
I know.
I don't worry about that. It's just...
He's really helping me, like you said he would.
And thank you for everything...
Stop. You're doing all the hard work yourself.
Wow. Okay. This might actually be working.
ANNALISE: It worked!
(SHOUTING) Shut up!
FRANK: Don't you think we should help Caleb?
I mean, the guy's got billions and this whole mess depends on Philip being the mastermind.
And you think you can find the man that the FBI can't?
No, but maybe they already found him.
They're just not letting us know
'cause they believe his story, not ours.
You ever consider that?
If they believe the inbred trash over us, then we deserve to go down for this.
BONNIE: Annalise, we need to talk about Jason's hearing.
What are you all still doing here?
We're working, you know, for you.
Well, do it somewhere else.
I want my house back.
You still wanna pretend like everything's fine?
Empathy doesn't even cover it.
This mother's a miracle.
I mean, the amount of will it takes to forgive your son's killer?
Who does that?
Not to say that
I can't see the other side of it.
How do you know he won't go out and kill again?
You don't.
He probably will.
But I do think people are redeemable.
We're all capable of having a bad day.
It doesn't mean it should define you for life.
Where are you going, dude?
Gotta take a squirt.
OLIVER: Hey, wait a minute.
Michaela, is it just me, or is there, like, a lot of chemistry between you and Asher?
I don't think I've ever been more insulted.
He's just trying to pawn our new roommate off on you.
(CHUCKLES)
That's not happening.
OLIVER: Are you sure?
I mean, his moves in that rap video were pretty good, which means he's probably awesome in bed.
Oli, I told you, he just needs friends right now.
Yeah, but why us?
Because his mom's a jerk, and, and Bonnie just dumped him and...
Look, I get that he's a pain in the ass sometimes, but shouldn't I be getting some credit here for trying to be a good person for once?
So, you're just pretending to like him so that you can make yourself feel better?
I don't know.
Would that really be that bad of a thing?
MICHAELA: I only like you when you're an ass.
DOCTOR:
I'm really patient, Wes.
What do you want me to say?
That I grew up poor?
Was bullied? That my mom killed herself?
'Cause all that's true, but I've gotten through my whole life knowing it and it's never caused me to lose sleep.
Know what has, though?
The law school.
First year is the hardest and I am so behind, I just...
(SCOFFS) You can't even know.
Okay.
I'll just ignore the bomb drop about your mom if you promise me there's nothing else going on with you right now?
It's just law school?
Yes. That's all.
Wes...
We were so close.
Annalise Keating?
The professor you work for who got shot?
That has nothing to do with this.
See, that's where we disagree.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Come in.
What do you want?
BONNIE: Michaela found a discrepancy on Jason's case.
Tyler's phone was never recovered, so I searched his records and saw the last text he ever sent was to his mother,
"I love you."
A mama's boy, how sweet.
But he spelled "love" L-U-V.
Tyler never did that in any of his previous texts.
That was only Jason.
It's a simple question that I need a simple answer to.
"Yes, I sent the text from Tyler's phone," or "No, I don't know what you're talking about."
If I tell you the truth, you can't tell anyone else, right?
You just told us the truth.
Don't you ever tell that to anyone again.
Understood?
JOYCE: I have been so angry...
At you mostly, but angry at the lawyers, the system, and God.
I have looked up everything there is to know about you, Jason, and I get it now.
Your father's in jail.
You didn't have a mother like me.
You didn't have anyone.
You grew up alone.
And I can't blame you for that.
I blame a world that lets you own a gun and that lets you grow up without love.
'Cause if what you're saying is true...
This was an accident, and I don't see the point in your whole life being ruined because of one terrible mistake.
So, this is a selfish act
I am doing here, Jason.
Forgiving you.
Because I can't live the rest of my life being angry.
(VOICE BREAKING)
And neither can you.
So, maybe we can help each other. Huh?
Wouldn't that be nice? To just...
Just to help each other after all this horribleness?
(SNIFFLES)
SAM: What case is that?
The same one you're trying to sabotage.
(SCOFFS)
I just said maybe wait a day until he booked it. That's all.
Me taking this case is all your fault, you know.
I would never have signed onto a federal case if it weren't for you and the Dean pushing me...
If you don't want the tenure, screw it.
I want the tenure.
But only 'cause he doesn't wanna give it to me.
What do you think?
You think your mom will finally get what she deserves?
Stop.
I think she will, and then the school's gonna wonder what took them so long in the first place because your mom's not wasting her talents changing your diapers all day.
You tell him.
Your dad, on the other hand, is lazy and will happily stay home with you all day.
And all you'll have to worry about is pooping and burping.
Male bonding at its best.
(SHOUTING) I think of Lila...
Sam!
(LOCK DISENGAGES)
You know, why is it that women feel the need to hide themselves when they cry?
Huh?
Or is that just me?
Maybe it's easier to cry alone.
Hmm.
You don't believe in this process, do you?
Depends on the client.
Some are good, some are bad.
But the bad ones need more than a talking-to to learn their lesson.
JASON: Every day I wake up kicking myself.
Why'd I bring that gun?
If I just left it home, we woulda got in a fight, bashed each other's faces...
No one would be dead.
You'd still have your son.
When you said that you wanted this hearing...
I felt weird.
But also, for the first time,
I had hope.
That I can try to be better.
That's because of you.
I wanna do everything I can to earn your forgiveness.
Let's take 15.
I'm not finished.
Jason, you're upset.
I lied.
(SNIFFLES) I shot him on purpose.
I saw the blood everywhere.
He was gasping.
Uh, and then his phone buzzed.
He was reaching for it, so I grabbed it.
You texted him if he needed a ride home.
(JASON SNIFFLES)
I didn't want you to find him, so I texted you.
I texted, "Found a ride."
And "I love you."
His last words to me were yours.
(SNIFFLES) I let him die.
I let him die.
ANNALISE:
Nothing he said in there
is admissible in trial.
I know, but tear up any plea deal we negotiated prior to this.
He told the truth, and that was the whole point of this hearing.
It was a hearing neither of us wanted.
And this is still my decision.
I'm upping the charge from second degree to first.
And I'm going for the death penalty.
NATE: I can't be seen with you.
We're just two good-looking dudes talking shop.
Just tell me what you want.
Any word on Philip?
I already told Annalise, they think he's in Canada.
That was a week ago.
Yep, and the feds aren't really calling a beat cop with updates.
Hold up.
You talk to her lately?
Why do you care?
'Cause I do.
And so do you, that's obvious.
Unless you're just covering up for us so you can use it against us later.
Okay, this just got stupid again.
Something's off, Nate.
I've known her a long time.
I've seen her go through bad stuff but...
A visit might do her good, is all.
If Annalise knew you were trying to get me to worry about her, she'd fire your ass. Or worse.
Don't come here again.
ANNALISE: File a motion for vindictive prosecution and prepare mitigation evidence in case we lose that.
I'll prep penalty phase, witnesses, too.
It would be unethical for us to be seen here together.
I don't care.
Nothing's changed for me.
What I saw in there proves that process works.
Jason's life is worth saving.
You might think you know what you're doing, but you're in denial.
Jason lied to you.
He stood there over your son while he bled out.
Hate won't win.
Don't you get that?
Well, I just did.
Your boy's still dead.
It might be easy for me to go through life hating Jason.
But that only destroys me.
And I want to feel better.
And my feelings are what's important here.
Not the D.A.'s, not yours, mine.
Because I lost my son. Me.
And I don't want an eye for an eye.
No, I don't buy you...
I want to heal, and I want Jason to heal.
And he's not doing that on death row.
So, get over yourself and do your job.
See that?
That's his nose, his eyes.
Oh, wow.
The heartbeat?
Let's hear it.
(HEART BEATING)
It's strong.
Heart rate's good.
Head circumference is normal for size.
I'm supposed to fly to Cleveland tomorrow.
It's for a case.
Cleveland's, what, an hour-and-a-half flight?
Mmm-hmm.
You'll be fine.
Now, right here, if you look closely, you see the kidneys, which are also good for form and position.
ANNALISE: We need
to convince the A.D.A.
to come back to the table.
Get her to consider our original plea deal.
CONNOR: What?
Why would we want to get him less time?
Seriously.
If Catherine deserves to go to jail, then an actual murderer definitely does.
Your guilt about Catherine is not about her, it's about your feelings towards Caleb.
No.
It's about the fact that I actually have a conscience, and don't tell me there's something wrong with that.
We've all done terrible things, the worst things, all of us.
And none of us has spent one day in jail.
But we all seem fine with that.
Why?
Because you all think you're good people?
That your lives are worth something?
Then what's Jason's life worth?
What about Wes's life?
He's in a psych ward and you don't care.
He's what?
What are you talking about?
He went for some sleeping pills and they locked him up.
When the hell did you find that out?
Annalise knows and she won't do anything.
He could crack in there, tell them everything.
Yeah, if he hasn't already.
Why haven't you done anything to get him out?
'Cause she only cares about her damn naps.
Everyone is tired and saying things they don't mean.
I meant every word.
We need to prep for Jason's hearing.
No, that's your job.
I'm done doing whatever the hell she says.
I'm with her.
Me, too.
Asher?
How could you just leave him in there?
They're big babies.
They'll get over it.
Commonwealth v. Miller.
We're gonna bring that to the judge as precedent, and we're gonna tell her that the original deal should stand.
Then you're gonna find me any other precedents.
We're gonna get Jason the deal he deserves.
LEIGH: After attempting a restorative justice hearing,
per Your Honor's instructions,
the Commonwealth has decided to move forward with trial.
We're also raising our charges to first degree and we'll be seeking the death penalty.
Based on evidence that just came to light during our hearing.
LEIGH: We'll be using independent means to support our case at trial.
Which still makes it illegal, Your Honor, and I cite Wong Sun v.
United States as precedent.
I also request that you remove A.D.A.
Leigh from the case based on bias against my client as a result of said hearing.
The defense has no proof of bias, Your Honor.
Jason trusted that what he said during the hearing would not be used against him.
You now changing your charge proves your own bias.
And accepting the change, Your Honor, destroys any chance of this process being used in the future.
That is a leap.
ANNALISE: The first time restorative justice gets applied to a murder charge hearing, the client gets punished for it?
This case cannot bear the weight of all future cases.
My client's life is at stake here because he trusted in an experimental legal process that you demanded he take part in,
Your Honor.
LEIGH: So, now you're blaming the judge?
No, the point is that
I'm not blaming my client, and neither is the victim's mother, whose voice is still not being heard!
JUDGE: I hear you,
Ms. Keating, but I am finding no legal recourse to remove the A.D.A. or throw out the charge.
That is a matter for the jury.
A jury of strangers when the victim's mother's demanding rehabilitation.
JUDGE: I'm sorry,
Ms. Keating...
ANNALISE: Demand the D.A. present the original deal, Judge.
Show our colleagues that we need to stop blaming the defendants and start blaming ourselves for a system that tears apart families by incarcerating every man of color that steps foot in the courtroom.
And then we scold them for not raising their children right.
I mean, let's end the cycle.
It's within your power here today, Your Honor.
Ms. Leigh, is the Commonwealth truly steadfast in pursuing capital punishment?
Upon reflection, we are willing to forgo the death penalty.
Thank you.
LEIGH: But only if
Mr. Murray will agree to life imprisonment without parole.
The original deal was 15 years,
Your Honor.
I'll take it.
No. Let me negotiate.
Jason, stop, let her defend you.
Sit down.
I need to pay for what I did to you.
JOYCE: No, you don't.
You need to make it better...
ANNALISE:
Let me help you, okay?
JOYCE: And you can't do that if you're in jail. Jason!
Stop, please!
Everyone, just stop!
(SIGHS)
I wanna take this deal, Judge.
(VOICE BREAKING)
And here's my number, all right?
Call me, you call me whenever you want.
JASON: Please, stop.
JOYCE: Look at me.
Look at me, Jason.
I'm not giving up on you.
That's not how this works.
I want to know you and I want you to know me. Okay?
You don't get a say in that.
You hear me?
Okay.
We're in this together now, okay?
All right? Okay.
Okay, okay.
I knew this wouldn't work.
WES: My mom worked a bunch of jobs, so I usually let myself in after school.
Did my homework, sometimes watched TV at our neighbor's.
But that day...
All I saw was blood.
I didn't know what was going on, so I just stood there.
(SNIFFLES)
I knew I was supposed to go over to her.
Help her.
They took her to the hospital, tried to save her, but...
(SCOFFS) She died in the ambulance.
I was 12.
You've been triggered, Wes.
Your boss was shot.
She almost died.
And it may seem unrelated to you, but...
It's making you remember.
I just need to sleep.
Please.
ROSE: (SIGHS) Sorry I'm late.
Oh, don't worry about it.
You know me, as long as I have a place to sit,
I can wait all day.
(CHUCKLES)
Where's Christophe?
At the neighbor's.
He'd be a pain if I brought him.
(EXHALES DEEPLY) So, how are you feeling?
I was going to bring that back brace.
I forgot.
Next time.
Thank you.
What is it?
(CHUCKLES) You're making me nervous.
Open it.
Who are you?
A lawyer.
No. You don't need to be scared.
(WHISPERS) That's not true anymore.
There's a way that I can help you, but only if you don't run away from me right now.
What does that mean?
I won't let you get hurt, or your son.
Just sit down, Rose.
Sit down.
(SNIFFLES)
MICHAELA: If you do not
let us at least speak
to the attending in charge, we'll be forced to file an injunction, which will call into question not only you, but every nurse and doctor in this department.
WES: Michaela?
CONNOR:
So, what'd you
say in there?
I mean, they let you out early, so you must have said something, right?
I didn't tell her anything.
I wasn't... I...
You don't have to worry.
I talked about my childhood to get her off my back.
It worked.
ASHER: Must have been nice, though.
To talk to someone.
I mean, we don't ever really do that.
And I get it, it's not like we need to be up each other's butts all the time, it's just... (SIGHS)
I don't know, I thought maybe it'd be nice if we...
Didn't lie to each other from now on.
Who's lying to you?
ASHER: That I know of?
Walsh.
What?
I overheard you say you only hang out with me out of pity.
No, I...
Don't lie, man.
Yeah, all right, look, I...
I said that, but hey...
I just worry about you, is all.
Yeah, because you think
I'm gonna snitch.
No, but...
I mean, if you thought about it,
I wouldn't blame you.
After Sam, that's all I wanted to do.
And the only reason
I got through any of this was...
Us? 'Cause we're all besties.
CONNOR: No.
Oliver.
Aw.
Look, I'm just saying that we clearly don't have Annalise to look out for us anymore, so that's our job from now on.
Okay, I'm gonna open the window to throw up now.
Michaela...
I'm allowed to be weirded out by this conversation.
Why? 'Cause you're afraid to have feelings?
Around you people?
Yes.
Why can't we count on Annalise anymore?
Today she showed her true colors.
Or we finally opened our eyes.
She's sick.
She just needs time to get better.
She needs therapy.
We all need therapy.
No, we don't.
'Cause we gots each other.
Right, Mr. Softy Wofty?
Okay, look, it's...
I only said that to make you feel better, so can we all just not talk for the rest of the ride? Please?
(SCOFFS)
(HOUSE MUSIC PLAYING)
(DOOR OPENS)
FRANK:
Surprised you showed up.
Why?
We walked out on Annalise, not you.
I'm not sure there's a difference.
Okay.
What about the whole
"We can't let Annalise get between us" rule?
That's before your ungrateful, spoiled asses decided to kick a woman while she's down.
She deserved that.
So, forget about her then.
Let's talk about us.
How you lied to me about Wes.
I told Annalise.
She didn't care.
Which is why you should have told me, your boyfriend, who can help you.
You're not my boyfriend.
What?
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
LAUREL: Boyfriends
don't lie to their
girlfriends all the time.
You are the one who just got caught lying.
So, you're telling me you don't lie to me all the time?
Of course not.
Another lie.
Okay. What's going on with you?
Nothing. Just tell me I'm wrong.
That you don't lie to me on a daily basis about all the crap you do for Annalise.
See? You can't.
I can't do it anymore either.
What does that mean?
(LAUREL GROANS)
Wes shot Annalise, not me.
She told him Rebecca was dead, so he shot her in the stomach because he wanted her dead.
And I don't blame him.
But somehow she does, even though this was all her idea, she blames him!
FRANK: Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know.
That's not an answer.
I know. I'm sorry, but...
You don't tell me things either.
Why do you keep saying that?
"What if it's mostly bad things?"
That is what you said to me, and then you shut down.
Meanwhile, all I've done since then is think about it.
The terrible things you've done.
I know you drugged Catherine, and dumped her in the woods.
So, are they worse than that?
LAUREL: (VOICE BREAKING)
See? You won't tell me.
(SNIFFLES)
Maybe I shouldn't know. But...
I just can't keep doing this, you know.
Falling for you, because I am.
Not if I'm never going to actually get to know you.
So...
It's better we stop.
With everything that's going on, it's just all gotten too complicated.
(VOICE BREAKING)
(SNIFFLES)
Right.
I'll go.
I killed Lila.
(SIGHS)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(SIGHS)
What?
CONNOR: I just got an email.
It's a video from that night.
And I don't know what to do.
WES: (OVER COMPUTER)
Where's Connor?
Connor, talk to me.
I think Philip's back.

## S02E12

ANNALISE: Previously on
How to Get Away With Murder...
I shot Annalise Keating.
But I was drugged by Philip Jessup.
The police won't tell us anything about Philip, if they know where he is...
It's not my job to take care of you anymore.
CONNOR: I just got an e-mail.
It's a video from that night.
Connor, talk to me.
I think Philip's back.
LAUREL: I just can't keep doing this.
Not if I'm never going to actually get to know you.
I killed Lila.
(GASPING)
Who are you?
I won't let you get hurt, or your son.
LAUREL: Wes went to the health center
and they checked him into the psych ward.
He's a mess.
He just needs you to forgive him.
ANNALISE: Just sit down, Rose.
Come on, sit down.
Come on.
I'm sorry, but I was afraid that you would refuse to talk to me if you knew who I was.
And you think this is better?
I'm not asking you to lie.
I only want you to tell me what you know.
You're asking me for a lot more than that.
Just tell me what you saw that night.
CHARLES: Why do we have to go through this again?
Because your story has to be airtight if we put you on the stand.
It's stayed the same every time you've asked.
Then you don't mind telling me one more time.
Let's go.
From the beginning.
It's a habit I picked up from my father, first one in, last one out.
I've worked the night shift since I started.
Get there at 8:00, finish up around 3:00 a.m.
What time did you get to the 11th floor?
Around midnight.
I guess I started dozing off around midnight, decided that I should head home.
So, I started packing up my stuff when the, uh, cleaning lady came in.
Rose.
Rose, yeah. Right.
Did you see anyone when you got out of the elevator?
No. The floor was empty.
But then I went into the corner office and saw him...
Mr. Mahoney.
Which one?
Charles.
The young one.
The older one never stayed that late.
We talked about the weather, something like that, how the rain hadn't let up.
And, um... Then I left.
What did you talk about?
The rain.
Did they tell you to say that?
No.
The roads were slick, so... It took me longer to get home that night.
When I saw the police lights on my street,
I thought maybe there had been a car accident.
Then I saw they were outside our front door.
(SNIFFLES)
So, I pushed inside, and I saw Vickie.
(SNIFFLES)
She was covered in blood...
That's... That's enough.
We're done.
I've got good news.
Your story matches Rose's.
You spoke to her?
She's agreed to testify.
Congratulations, you've got your alibi.
(SIGHS)
Is she dead?
What did we do?
CONNOR: His e-mail is Argus.
It's from Greek mythology.
Argus is a 100-eyed giant who sees everything, which means Philip has seen everything.
Isn't that cute of him?
He's taunting us with nicknames.
So, what do you want me to do?
I'm not in the video.
You don't get to hold a grudge right now.
No?
Because you all said some very hurtful things.
Yeah, and you made us shoot you, so I think that we're even.
Laurel shot me.
You ran away, as you tend to do.
Interesting, too, isn't it, that you're the only one not in this?
What, you think that I sent it?
Anything's possible with you people.
Okay. Let's be clear about something.
(SIGHS) I was a mess that night.
So I didn't stop to record anything.
Plus, I went back in the house.
Don't you remember that?
I tried to stop you from bleeding out.
Maybe I did.
I mean, maybe
I'm the reason that you're still alive.
(SIGHS)
I'm sorry.
It's just...
We need your help.
Please.
Finally, you remember your manners.
Call the others.
Wait, isn't it better that they don't know?
I mean, especially Asher.
He could flip out.
Millstone is the reason we're in this mess.
He doesn't get a pass.
Call everyone except for Wes.
We spent that whole time defending Rebecca.
You... You sat in that courtroom with us, even after what we did with Sam.
The only reason why any of that was okay was because...
(LAUREL SNIFFLES)
He killed Lila.
Sam. Not you.
It was me.
Why?
See?
You can't say it because you're lying.
You didn't do it!
I did.
Then tell me why you did it.
Was it because you knew Lila?
Because you were sleeping with her?
No.
(VOICE BREAKING)
Then tell me why!
I had to.
(SIGHS) Why?
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Don't you dare answer that.
It's Annalise.
I don't care.
(RINGING CONTINUES)
Oh, my God.
(SIGHS) You did it for Annalise?
'Cause Annalise knew that, uh, Sam got Lila pregnant.
So she had you kill her?
I'll explain. Just...
(RINGING CONTINUES)
Hang on.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Sorry. I was in the shower.
BONNIE: Philip recorded
the kids at the
mansion that night.
What?
Just get to the house.
I'll explain.
Okay. Okay, we'll be right there.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(SNIFFLES)
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)
(GASPS)
(RINGING CONTINUES)
(WHISPERING IN SPANISH)
(SNIFFS)
BONNIE: Frank, finally.
Where's Laurel?
What, she's not here?
No, and she's not answering her phone.
Maybe Philip kidnapped someone for real this time.
What took you so long?
I didn't hear my phone.
Will someone please show me the freaking video?
What do we do?
Respond?
We should call Oliver, have him hack that bitch back.
No.
I agree.
It's too dangerous to involve Oliver.
Frank, get your guy to see if he can find out where the e-mail came from.
But what do we do if we find him?
I mean, we're not gonna... Like...
CONNOR: He's a hacker.
We're not gonna be able to find him by tracking his IP address.
We have to try.
It's a trap.
He didn't send it to the police, he sent it to us.
Because the only thing it proves is that Philip also was at the scene of the crime that night.
So, sit down, take a deep breath, and let Mommy take care of it the way she always does.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
(DOOR OPENS)
If this is about why Michaela keeps calling,
I don't care.
Me neither. (SNIFFS)
Then why are you here?
Who's Charles Mahoney?
I don't know.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
What's going on?
(SIGHS) Nothing.
You're acting weird.
You are, too.
I had a fight with Frank, and I don't want to talk about it.
Well, I don't want to talk, either, but you came here.
Tell me who Charles Mahoney is, and then I'll tell you what our fight was about.
I don't know who he is.
Right, but then you have a whole file of things about his trial.
Annalise dropped it off.
You saw her?
No, she just left this file here, and
I don't know why...
Other than to make me go crazy.
Go crazy about what?
My mother.
Annalise knew her.
(COMPUTER CHIMES)
CONNOR: Oh, my God.
What?
Dude, open your pie hole.
He e-mailed again.
Annalise?
ANNALISE:
"Deposit $1 million in the below account within 36 hours,
"or this goes to the police..."
CONNOR: Now what,
Mommy?
ANNALISE: Frank. My office.
Retire the Men's Warehouse.
What the hell?
You have to look the part if I'm taking you to Ohio.
I get to go?
No hotel bars, no girls, no anything.
I need you on your "A" game, assuming you have one.
I'll be a saint.
Ooh. (LAUGHS)
Like a glove.
(LAUGHS)
What's this?
New duds for the Mahoney trial.
Oh, Fishtown's going to the majors.
Congrats.
FRANK: Thanks.
How long we going for?
No more than a month.
A month?
Seriously...
What if that thing decides to come out early?
Women have been giving birth since time began.
I can definitely stand in a courtroom while pregnant and kick ass.
I was only asking so I can pick which weekends to visit.
Oh, no, no, no,
I don't want you sniffing around, talking to my belly.
Exactly. We got to focus on the case.
(LAUGHS)
Ohio, here we come.
(CHUCKLES)
LAUREL: We should go to Ohio.
We could read the transcript, see how your mom was involved.
No.
There's got to be a ton of flights.
We're not flying to Ohio when I can just ask Annalise.
She doesn't want to see you.
How do you know that?
Because I asked her to help me get you out of the psych ward, and she said no.
Don't worry.
She'll get over it.
But we can get the answers on our own until that happens.
I don't have money to just buy a last-minute...
It's on my father.
Window or aisle?
FRANK: You want to know why Philip's an idiot?
'Cause he thinks a self-employed lawyer has got $1 million lying around.
Well, I do have some of it.
Sam's insurance money.
And if you want something to worry about, find your girlfriend.
The more time goes by, the more I think she actually did get kidnapped.
Enter the word or phrase separated by plus signs, and it'll find all instances of that word from the judicial database.
So, if we were looking for Rose Gibbins...
Actually, it's...
Rose Edmond.
(KEYBOARD KEYS CLACK)
(COMPUTER BEEPS)
What if we wanted to pull up all the court transcripts from a specific case,
US v. Charles Mahoney?
When was the trial?
2005.
All court transcripts before '09 are hard copy only.
I can have them delivered from storage if you like.
We have time.
Mmm. Suit yourself.
So, Gibbins is your dad's last name?
No.
They changed my name when I went into foster care.
Who did?
My foster family.
They thought it'd help me acclimate.
And you believed that?
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
No, of course you did. I just...
WES: Frank?
Such a baby. (SIGHS)
I'll go get us some snacks or something.
How much do you earn at your janitorial position at Mahoney Hedge Management?
$7 an hour.
That's not a lot.
A woman in your position might try to earn money in other ways.
Testifying in this trial, for example.
I didn't get paid to do this.
You're telling us there wasn't a bank account set up?
Maybe a college fund for your son, Christophe, in return for your cooperation?
You promised you wouldn't bring my son into this.
Don't look at her.
I'm the one asking the questions.
What about a green card to stay in the country?
This was a mistake.
I can't do this for you.
Your immigration status has nothing to do with you testifying.
You say that, but a prosecutor might want to call ICE.
And then what happens to Christophe?
You can trust me.
I won't let anyone hurt you two.
Shame on you, using your own baby to make me do this.
Rose, wait.
I can fix this, all right?
Listen, let me explain.
She wants assurance that she'll be protected from deportation.
Tell her, yes.
I did, but she specifically asked to testify anonymously.
I spoke to the judge, and he agreed, so she'll be giving a statement in another room, her identity and voice obscured.
What jury is going to believe a witness hiding behind a black dot?
It's my job to make them believe her.
How?
You need to look into someone's eyes to know whether or not they're telling the truth.
That's not gonna happen here.
So, either we agree to this, or Charles loses his alibi.
You tell Rose that the only reason she and her son have a roof over their heads is because of the paychecks this company has been giving them over the years.
Don't look at him.
Shall I talk to her?
Do you need me to take care of this?
We need to trust
Ms. Keating, Sylvia.
We hired her for a reason.
She has a reputation for taking risks.
Dad, there has to be some other way.
I mean, she's poor...
Shut your mouth.
This woman holds our son's life completely in her hands.
As a parent,
I'm sure she can appreciate how concerned we are for his fate.
Please remind her of that.
(SIGHS) Laurel and Wes' phones are both going to voicemail.
(SHUSHES)
If I can prove there's no premeditation,
I can plead voluntary manslaughter.
That's, what, 10 years?
Fifteen, max?
I'd be massive by the time
I get out, all swole and...
What are you doing right now?
I'm just trying to get ahead of this thing before the video comes out.
It's not going to.
Okay, but if it does, it's only fair that I take the fall and explain everything, or at least some...
Do you trust me?
Yeah.
Then believe me when I say
I will tell you when it's time to freak out.
We're not there yet.
You know what would help calm him down?
You banging him.
You bang him.
I'm fine right here.
Just talked to Laurel.
She's in bed with the flu.
What'd you do?
Nothing.
Seriously, I'm a much better boyfriend these days.
What?
That's how we're gonna go get the money.
Michaela?
Yeah?
Get your coat.
We're gonna pay a visit to your boyfriend.
I hate it here.
How do you think I feel?
What is this?
A rare occurrence when I come to offer an apology.
You were right about
Philip. It's in all our interests to find him.
What changed your mind?
To be honest, Ms. Pratt made a strong case on your behalf.
So, how do we find him?
First, you give me
$250,000 retainer.
All cash, so there's no record of our working together.
Done. Then?
You go to Catherine.
You get her to tell you everything she knows about Philip.
She already told us what she knows.
Has she?
She's in prison because of Philip.
Why would she still hide anything?
Because she's scared to tell you the truth, disappoint you.
You have to stop making her out to be the villain here.
We're not saying she's the villain.
We're saying she's been victimized by one.
And you're the only one she'll open up to, especially if she thinks
Philip is still a danger to you.
Just talk to her.
That's all we're asking.
CATHERINE:
You let her in our house?
The FBI won't tell us anything, but Annalise, she wants to help us find Philip.
Why? Have you thought about that?
She was shot, Catherine.
Like you need to remind me.
She blames Philip for that, not you.
So, if there's something else you know...
I won't be mad.
(SNIFFLES)
I love you.
(SNIFFLES)
Just tell me.
Did he do it?
Kill Mom and Dad?
(SNIFFLES)
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Maybe I did it myself.
Don't say that.
Maybe I killed them for Philip because he's the brother who'd actually love me the way I always wanted.
You were the one who was supposed to have my back.
(SNIFFLES)
You sure know how to pick 'em.
Must have been one long-ass trial.
Happy hunting.
SCHULER: Mahoney Hedge
Management has been under surveillance by the FBI and the FEC for years.
The government believes that the company, founded and run by Wallace Mahoney, swindled millions from their clients, hardworking citizens who trusted
Wallace and Charles with their savings.
But the Mahoneys have yet to be brought to justice.
Why?
Because the one person on the inside with a conscience,
Vickie Moran, was brutally bludgeoned to death by her fiance, Charles Mahoney.
He discovered that she was about to turn on him and his family, so he killed her with his own two hands.
ANNALISE: It's easy for the prosecution to paint
someone like Charles Mahoney
as a greedy,
money-hungry monster
out to protect his fortune.
It's a cliche that the prosecutor is counting on you to believe.
But it's a story he's made up, a piece of bad fiction with no merit and not a single piece of physical evidence against my client, Charles.
Here is the witness list.
Is she on it?
No, but do any of the names look familiar?
ALEXANDRA: I'm Special Agent
Alexandra Kain.
Ms. Moran started working with me three months prior to her murder.
Christophe, you're not in trouble.
She had been resistant to my previous attempts, but then agreed to act as my informant after a physical abuse altercation with the defendant.
Objection. Hearsay.
Sustained.
WES: There's an anonymous witness.
G-34.
Why would they allow a witness to testify anonymously?
If the judge believed their life was in danger.
It must be her.
CORONER: The fatal blow
struck the victim on
the back of the head,
lacerating a four-inch section of the scalp.
ANNALISE: Objection.
Lack of scientific foundation.
MAN 1: The trajectory
of blood spatter
shows the angle of impact.
ALEXANDRA: Vickie told me
Charles was acting strange...
MAN 1: since 2003,
MAN 2: and had seen
profits exceeding all
our expectations.
Here.
I found her.
ANNALISE: My first witness will testify anonymously via closed-circuit television feed.
The jury should note that the witness will be under oath, and that their testimony should be given the same weight as any other testimony.
"Judge, 'Ms. Keating, do you need more time...'" to collect your witness?
No, Your Honor.
My associate has assured me that the witness is ready.
It should just be another moment.
(SPECTATORS MURMURING)
(MURMURING CONTINUES)
Ms. Keating, this is getting rather ludicrous.
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
WES: She didn't show.
No, keep looking.
Witness G-34 is listed as "failure to appear."
She never testified.
ANNALISE: Why do you think
I brought you with me?
To prevent this exact thing from happening.
She said she had to use the ladies'.
What, was I supposed to follow her in there?
Go away.
I'll get her back.
And the jury?
How do we make sure we get them back?
It's a setback.
I've overcome worse.
My corporate attorneys told me not to hire you, but every judge and lawyer friend I know told me that we would need a woman if we had any chance at winning.
And with a jury made up mostly of minorities, a woman of color would be best.
So, I found you.
Turns out, there aren't a lot of women like you out there, which is why I went against my instincts and chose to ignore this.
Maybe it'd even make you more sympathetic to the jury, I thought.
But now...
(SIGHS)
Don't give your people a bad name.
(RINGING)
(RECEIVER CLICKS)
SAM: Hey! She's alive.
Barely. I might be home sooner than I thought.
Really? You already get your "not guilty"?
I messed up with
a witness today,
and I'm about to be fired.
You want my opinion?
Why else would I be calling you?
(SAM CHUCKLES)
I think you should quit.
Who cares about keeping
some bastard rich
kid out of jail?
That said,
you will hate yourself
if you walk away right now, and then I'll bear the brunt of your crankiness for weeks.
So, either way, it's about your feelings.
Well, who else's matter?
You know what?
I'm gonna quit just to make you suffer.
(SAM LAUGHS)
Suffer how?
Uh-huh.
No, I want to hear you say it.
(DOOR CLOSES)
BONNIE: Caleb just called.
Catherine gave him nothing.
(SIGHS)
You know, we could stop.
Let it all burn.
We'll go to jail.
But is this really better than that?
I never wanted children.
Never even crossed my mind till I turned your age, and everyone asking,
"When?" "Why not?"
"You'll feel different when the baby's in your hands.
"It's the greatest experience of your life."
Now I have five of them, and I know...
It's the worst experience of my life.
Everyone, go home.
Is everything okay?
No, but we're not gonna fix anything tonight.
But what about the deadline?
We only have, like, 12 more hours.
We'll meet up in the morning, decide what to do then.
Go. Have sex, get drunk, whatever makes you happy
'cause we don't know what the hell is gonna happen tomorrow.
(SIGHS)
They're closing.
We can come back tomorrow.
Wes?
They killed her when she didn't testify.
And made it look like a suicide?
You sound like Asher.
Except this time, it's true.
Annalise needs my mom as a witness, but gets her killed, leaves her son an orphan.
So, when he applies to law school, she helps him get in...
I only got accepted here two days ago.
From the waitlist.
Adds a fifth spot to her team so he can work with her...
ANNALISE: I've decided to hire one more of you.
And that one will be Wes Gibbins.
And she protected me.
Even after what I did.
(GASPS)
WES: I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
Tell me I'm wrong, Laurel.
MICHAELA:
I didn't come because of Annalise.
I came to see how you were doing.
How do you think I'm doing?
Bitchy, apparently.
So much so, you can't appreciate a friend coming to check on you.
'Cause I'm sorry, but I don't see anyone else here.
Michaela. I'm sorry.
It's just...
What?
Catherine...
Did she say something?
No.
It's just...
I've never seen her this way.
And I know that's just what jail does, and that I need to be there for her, but...
(SIGHS)
I don't know what to believe anymore.
You believe what makes you feel better.
I've missed you.
I know that's weird to say.
We don't know each other that well.
We've seen each other naked.
I think that means we know each other.
(HOUSE MUSIC PLAYING)
Can I?
You don't have to ask.
There was this case in New Jersey, the defendant ordered diminished capacity because she had PMS.
They dropped the charge from murder to manslaughter.
I could argue something chemical too, right?
Like... Like 'roid rage or something...
Asher, I'm not doing this with you.
Well, as my lawyer,
I might make you.
I'm not your lawyer.
I know technically you...
I'm not your girlfriend either.
I protected you that night, and that confused things.
But I can't be that person for you.
There's never a chance that things could change in the future?
No.
You should go home and sleep.
You'll feel better in the morning.
Okay.
Okay.
(HOUSE MUSIC CONTINUES)
Wait. You eat red meat, right?
Look at me.
Of course I eat red meat.
Are you sure I can't help?
No.
You stay right there.
I got this.
(SIGHS)
What?
Nothing.
This looks good.
Save the compliments till you've tasted it.
OLIVER: Honey, I'm home.
(CHUCKLES) Uh, what was that?
Uh, it was just work stuff.
Okay, look, I know our sex life hasn't been the greatest since "the farter" took over the living room, but if you're on
Dude4Dude right now...
No, no, no. It's just...
Look.
Stanford. (SIGHS)
I'm applying to transfer.
And I want you to come with me.
What are you talking about?
Philip, the serial killer, he...
He knows where we live.
I don't know why we're waiting for him to break in while we're sleeping to steal locks of our hair when we should be moving.
Okay, so let's move.
Doesn't mean it has to be 3,000 miles away.
It's Silicon Valley.
You'll... You'll be readily employed, and by someone far more appreciative than Annalise.
Wow, she's really done a number on you.
Just think about it, okay?
(CHUCKLES) It's warm.
We'll do yoga all the time, and our asses will be totally toned.
(SIGHS) Okay, well, I've never even seen you study a lick, so let's just see if you get in.
My ass is offended.
Oh, yeah? Is it?
Well, let me see it.
I'll be sure to make it feel better.
You're the horniest person I know.
(WHISPERS) You love it.
(LAUGHS)
Okay. What's up?
Nothing.
Really?
'Cause the dress and you cooking...
I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to be thinking right now.
It's dinner.
There's nothing to think about.
Okay, but do you blame me for at least wondering why you're doing all this?
You know, I was just trying to do something nice for you.
(DISH CLATTERS)
(SIGHS)
You want me to go?
Do what you want.
I'm sorry, okay?
For saying that.
It wasn't intended the way you took it.
Thanks for dinner.
How did you intend me to take it?
How are my feelings not supposed to be hurt?
This is hard for both of us, Annalise.
What is, getting fed by me?
Figuring this out, us.
Why do you come here then?
Visit me while I'm sick, bring me Chinese food, why do that?
Because I'm trying to be here for you.
Is that all?
Because I'm the one thinking,
"Maybe he's coming here because it's all an act.
"He's just waiting for a chance to make me pay."
You're serious?
You still think that's possible?
Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.
You're wrong.
And you know how you can know that?
What good would that do me?
To tell the truth now?
Tell me how that helps out any of us at this point.
I forgave you, Annalise.
That's why I came here.
For dinner.
It's that simple.
Come here.
(DOOR OPENS)
WES: They said it'd take 20 minutes.
For a sandwich?
(SCOFFS)
They better be good.
Cleveland's finest.
What really happened?
He's been calling all day.
(SNIFFS) He's my father, basically.
I know, it's a total cliche, but, yeah.
I fell for my father.
What's the deal with your father?
Uh... (CHUCKLES)
(VOICE BREAKING) He is not a good person, to the point that, uh, everything we've done with Annalise...
Yeah, there's a reason why I haven't been as messed up by it as everyone else.
(SNIFFS) I thought
I'd get away from him, become someone better.
But instead, I ended up dating a guy just like him, and liking it.
That's the worst part.
And I don't know what to do with that, because...
(BREATHES SHAKILY)
What does that make me?
(SOBS)
You're not a bad person.
(SIGHS) Shut up.
I'm serious.
Maybe your dad is.
(LAUREL SIGHS)
And Frank, Annalise.
(SNIFFLES)
But you've been watching out for me when you didn't have to.
So...
Thank you, is all I'm saying.
Stop being so nice.
It makes me feel weird.
That was...
I really shouldn't have done that.
Uh, yeah. We're...
We're just tired.
Yeah.
I'll go check on the food.
Great, yeah.
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
You're not in trouble.
Then leave me alone.
You looked me straight in the eye, and you said you were telling the truth, but you weren't, were you?
You didn't see
Charles that night.
You can find another witness.
I know you can find someone to replace...
I can't. It's only you.
I don't know what's gonna happen anymore, Rose.
You said you would do this, and now...
This man,
I don't know what he will do if you don't do what you promised.
You're just as bad as them.
(LOCK CLICKS)
CHRISTOPHE: Who was that?
No one.
Go to bed.
We were going to watch TV.
Since when is it okay to give me mouth?
You go to bed when I say.
Go to bed!
MAN: Here's all the files on Rose Edmond.
The medical examiner's report.
And here's all the police reports from the investigation.
Anything else?
(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)
You really don't remember any of this?
I remember finding her.
Here. They call it a suicide.
"Cause of death attributed to acute blood loss
"from an incised wound to the neck.
"Based on angle and depth of the laceration,
"it appears the injury was self-inflicted."
Two medical examiners and the case detective signed off on it.
(SIGHS) This is my fault.
I made you come all the way here, and it was a stupid idea.
Let's go home.
Ohio sucks.
NATE: What time is it?
A little past 8:00.
Wow.
I can't remember the last time I slept that late.
(CHUCKLES) It's the sheets.
Yeah.
They're nice.
What?
You want my advice?
Of course.
You don't negotiate with crazies.
Wait them out.
Eventually, they surrender.
Anything else is throwing fuel on the fire.
So... I'm with you.
You do...
Nothing.
There was no time stamp on the video.
We can easily say it was taken on a different night.
I'm sure there's a way to prove it was taken that night.
People saw us, what we were wearing.
But if we pay him, have you thought that through?
What's to stop him from asking for another $1 million?
What's to stop him from sending it to the police?
His fear of getting found.
Do you really think this is about the money for him?
No, it's about feeling small, insecure, that, "Mommy and Daddy never loved me," because they didn't.
And now he's taking it out on us.
We're gonna call his bluff.
And what if he calls ours?
Let him.
Twenty seconds until the deadline.
Good.
Let him know that we're in this together.
Eight of us against one of his pathetic ass.
Actually, just six, since Wes and Laurel are still missing.
Maybe we tell him we need more time.
No, we don't.
Ten seconds.
Count it down.
Show him what we think of him, that we don't give a flying...
Five, four, three, two, one.
See?
Now get up and get some work done for once.
ASHER: Wait.
We beat his ass.
We beat his ass.
We beat his ass.
He can suck on my...
(COMPUTER CHIMES)
Well, that didn't last very long, did it?
When was this?
ANNALISE: Last night.
CONNOR: He's here in town?
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
I need to talk to you.
Alone.
Now is not a good time, Laurel.
I don't care.
You will when you see this video.
Philip's stalking us.
I said I don't care!
Now.
Did you know this whole time?
Know what?
This.
You really don't remember any of this?
I remember finding her.
There.
Is it true, hmm?
Did Wes kill his mother?
(CHOKING)
(GASPING)

## S02E13

ANNALISE: Previously on
How to Get Away With Murder...
Stanford. (SIGHS)
I'm applying to transfer.
And I want you to come with me.
LAUREL: Annalise knew that Sam got Lila pregnant.
So she had you kill her?
I don't know what to believe anymore.
You believe what makes you feel better.
CONNOR:
Philip e-mailed again.
BONNIE: When was this?
ANNALISE: Last night.
My mother.
Annalise knew her.
Just tell me what you saw that night.
I went into the corner office and saw him...
Charles.
ANNALISE:
She specifically asked
to testify anonymously.
WES: She didn't show.
I'll get her back.
Don't give your people a bad name.
I don't know what he will do if you don't do what you promised.
You're just as bad as them.
CHRISTOPHE: Who was that?
Go to bed!
I usually let myself in after school.
But that day...
All I saw was blood.
There. Is it true?
Did Wes kill his mother?
(CHOKING)
She was the key witness in the case, one of Annalise's.
It was a murder trial.
She gave me the files, which is why I went to Ohio, but the records show that she backed out of testifying.
Your mother or Annalise?
My mother.
She was a key witness.
That's why they killed her.
LAUREL: There.
Did Wes kill his mother?
Has Wes seen this?
No. It's true, then? He...
Of course not.
Some idiot wrote that down after looking at the crime scene for five minutes.
Now you're nervous
Wes will see it, which means it's true.
Enough.
You've worked with me too long to make these assumptions.
He could've seen this.
It would destroy him.
You know that.
Well, it's a good thing you stopped that from happening.
Why let him get near it, though?
You're the one who made him go to Ohio.
Because you gave him that file.
Why? So that he could go on a treasure hunt and find out his mother was killed?
Sounds crazy, I know, but...
"Crazy" is not a word we use lightly around here.
(SIGHS) I'm just saying
I know how it sounds.
It's why I came here.
I don't know how to talk to anyone else about it.
You mean Annalise?
Yes. But everyone else, too.
She died two days after she failed to show up to testify.
That's not a coincidence.
I agree, but I'm a therapist,
Wes, not the police.
Yeah, but you can help me remember what happened.
Please.
I have no one else.
ANNALISE: It was a suicide.
It was ruled a suicide, and don't tell me
I'm supposed to believe that after how much we proved the police lie all the time.
Well, they didn't lie about this.
You're just saying that so I won't tell Wes, and I won't, but at least tell me why I shouldn't.
Because it's none of your business.
Well, it is now.
Why?
Because now you're boyfriend and girlfriend?
You used up Frank, so now you're on to the next piece of damaged goods?
The fact that you are so angry right now attacking me when I'm trying to help you, it just proves you are hiding something.
Which is my right.
You're not Wes.
If he wants to ask me something, he needs to do it himself.
He thinks you hate him!
Well, then he needs to man up and get over it.
MELANIE: Okay.
Let's start with what you do remember.
You say she was involved with that trial, so do you remember her ever talking about it with anyone?
A friend or someone on the phone maybe?
Pick a card. Any card.
Mom?
Now what?
Give it here.
But make sure I don't see it.
Now, I'm gonna guess which card, and...
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Christophe.
Don't answer that.
(DOOR OPENS)
AGENT HOLT:
Is your mother home?
Yes. What is this?
I'm Agent Holt with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Are you Rose Edmond?
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
(DOOR BUZZING OPEN)
(SNIFFLES)
(DOOR CLOSES)
EVE: Miss Edmond.
I'm the lawyer with ICE.
I'll be handling your case.
I've lived here for years.
I don't cause any trouble.
I'm just a cleaning lady.
Well, that's not all you are.
Let's get started with your entrance into the US.
We have no record as to when you entered or...
Hey, it's Wes.
You know what to do.
(BEEP)
I don't care if you're not talking to Annalise.
You need to get over here.
I can't say why over the phone, but it involves Philip, so...
Call me back.
What?
We need to talk.
You mean you do?
(DOOR CLOSES)
You said you wanted to know me, even the bad things.
Because I never thought you'd admit to killing a pregnant sorority girl.
Hey.
Everything that has happened,
Sam dying, whatever it is that happened to Rebecca, although something tells me you killed her, too.
I didn't.
Great.
There's one thing going for you.
If I can even believe that.
Why would I lie about that now?
Because you want me to ignore what you did.
That's not what
I'm asking for.
Then why are we down here?
To find out if I told Annalise?
Well, I didn't.
Wes either, so does that help, knowing your secret's safe?
Can I go now?
I'm so sorry.
(SCOFFS)
(SIGHS)
I don't believe you.
ANNALISE: There's not a day
that goes by that I
don't lie to my clients.
Call it "unethical" or "illegal",
I just call it "smart".
CONNOR: Shouldn't we at least tell Nate?
Nate would want to get the police involved.
I thought he was the police.
Let me think, damn it.
Your job is to
protect your client
at all costs, from the prosecution to the judge, our failed justice system, but mostly, you protect them from themselves.
What about Caleb?
He's alone in that mansion and he could...
So what? You want to be the one that tells him we've been playing him this whole time?
We took his money to find Philip, and now we have, in town and wanting to kill everyone.
How do we know he's dangerous?
He tied up and tortured the Hapstalls before he killed them.
That means he's pretty much a sociopath.
Psychopath. They're the ones that get off on violence.
Everyone stop talking.
ANNALISE: Clients are
some of the most stupid
people you'll ever meet.
You give them too much information, they'll act on it, and always in a way that bones you.
CONNOR: Here we go.
(COMPUTER CHIMES)
Please tell me that's a reminder to take your sex-with-Oliver pill.
Nope.
It's from our bestie.
Oh, my God.
When was this?
MICHAELA: This morning.
I was just trying to be there for him.
You know, keep your enemies close. (SIGHS)
He was watching me.
Everybody relax.
It's just him trying to freak us out.
Yeah, well, it's working, isn't it?
We're not safe anymore.
ASHER: I am.
I've never met him, and I've never been in any of these videos.
Maybe we can use that.
I'm like a safe house.
We're all fine as long as we're all together.
CONNOR: Yeah, until he throws a pipe bomb through the window and blows us all up.
Here. Give it to me.
What?
CONNOR: No!
No one can see this.
I'm not playing with our lives anymore.
Give me the damn computer!
Annalise Keating.
What can I help you with?
ANNALISE: Philip Jessup.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Wish I had something.
Look at that.
Now you do.
He's been watching us, me and my students, which means that my life as well as theirs are in danger.
The FBI has a search out for Philip Jessup in Canada.
Now you're telling me he's been in town this whole time?
What's on this laptop will prove that, as well as provide evidence that could help them locate him.
What do you want?
Blanket immunity to cover me and my associates for anything related to the night
Emily Sinclair died.
Why would you need immunity for that night?
In case you misunderstand the evidence on this laptop.
I put Catherine Hapstall away for that murder based largely on your testimony.
No, based largely on her confession.
Okay.
Whatever game this is you're trying to rope me into based solely on your word...
Then don't believe me.
Wait.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
(SIGHS)
Sleepyhead.
I called you like five times.
I was working.
I'm just teasing.
Any luck with Rose?
We're all good there.
Just take the day off.
Really?
Yeah. Go to a bar, get laid.
Just leave me be.
ANNALISE: Finally.
Did you eat?
I was just ordering room service.
I, uh, fly all the way here.
I was kind of hoping we could do something better than overpriced hotel food.
It's on the client.
Right. Big spenders, I see.
Yes, I'd like the Cobb salad and Earl Grey tea, and, uh...
Same.
Two of each.
Oh, and a bottle of Riesling.
Your best. Thank you.
I feel like the devil.
Did it work?
She's thinking about it.
She'll say yes.
My point is we might have to go to church so I can atone for my sins.
Mmm. You have to believe in God for that.
Or maybe you do now.
Oh. Please.
Wow, you haven't aged at all.
(CHUCKLES) That's because you just saw me.
It was three years ago, Annalise.
Yeah.
I like the braids.
You still don't know how to take a compliment.
Eve.
What?
Please tell me you just got fat.
MELANIE: Annalise.
Why can't you just ask her these questions?
I'm not here about Annalise.
I'm here about my mother.
See, those two people, though.
Your relationship with Annalise, from what I can tell, is very muddy and in some ways feels maternal.
No. You're saying that, not me.
Or there's something you're scared to tell me.
You study the law.
You know anything you say here is protected.
Unless I'm gonna do harm to myself or someone else.
What does that mean?
You're right.
I should just talk to the police about this, not you.
I'm sorry for wasting your time.
Wes.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
MICHAELA: (SIGHS)
I want to see you, too.
Caleb?
Uh...
Dinner at your place?
CALEB: Yeah.
Be there at 8:00.
I'll have dinner waiting...
And dessert.
Uh, are you sure that's a good idea?
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?
No reason.
It's just, I was thinking...
Maybe you should stay somewhere else for a little in case Philip came back.
No. Abort. Abort.
What does that mean?
Did Annalise find something?
No, of course not.
Uh...
Annalise just got here, and she needs me, so, talk later.
Way to resist the magical penis.
It is magical and pretty.
ASHER: Okay, not everyone wants to hear about that.
Why hasn't she called yet?
No news is good news.
Since when?
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
See? That's her.
How'd it go?
He's getting approval right now.
She's waiting on approval.
CONNOR: Approval from who?
Why is it taking so long?
ANNALISE:
Tell them to relax.
You think that ever works?
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
Hold on.
Hi.
Are you at the D.A.'s office right now?
How do you know that?
We just got a call about being ready to serve a search warrant on your house
for evidence about Sinclair.
I'm here about Philip.
They've given me immunity.
No, they're playing you, Annalise.
(DOOR OPENS)
You are in luck.
The D.A. is open to granting the immunity deal.
How generous.
Well, I just need to get some routine information, fill in the blanks.
Who are you calling?
Bonnie, it's me.
Did you hear back from Denver?
I'm sitting with him now.
Turns out when I say "immunity deal," he hears "search warrant."
The cops are coming to raid the house.
What are you doing?
They'll be there soon, so here's what you do.
Shred everything.
You're asking us to shred files while you're in front of the A.D.A.?
That's right.
Oh, God.
For the record,
I thought that this was a bad idea.
Put it down.
So, we do nothing.
Exactly.
Burn it all down.
Destruction of evidence before a valid premise search is a felony.
There is no felony if there's no proof, and I'm guessing we have time since you don't have the judge's signature on the warrant yet.
The judge hasn't signed the warrant.
Find the judge on duty for emergency search warrants.
ASHER: We got the po-po out front.
Judge Hamilton is on call for warrants.
Who's his clerk?
CONNOR:
This is Troy Williams.
I am calling from
Judge Hamilton's office.
Yep, he just signed the warrant.
Your team should have a copy any minute.
Thank you.
(PHONE RINGS)
Yes.
Is it signed?
Good. Go in the house now.
And I want evidence of any tampering, any obstruction.
We got a signed search warrant, it gives us immediate access to these premises.
Where's our copy?
On the way.
You want to play tough guy, or you gonna let me do my job?
BONNIE: Is this Troy?
I'm here at
Annalise Keating's office where the police are executing a search warrant.
I was hoping we could get verbal confirmation on the judge's approval on this.
Oh, the judge didn't sign off on any warrant?
DENVER: Your Honor,
I was assured we had your signature. I...
No, no, of course not. I...
Yes, sir, I...
Everything in that house turned into fruit of the poisonous tree the second your officers entered it illegally.
So, you've got two options.
Either I sue your ass for abuse of authority...
Or you give me immunity and get the evidence you want from this computer.
Want one?
Right.
Just the first item on a long list of things you can't do now.
I should've told you.
Yep. (SIGHS)
I keep thinking something bad will happen.
So, why bother you with the news if I'm only gonna take it back later?
Nothing bad's gonna happen.
You don't know that.
The size of that bump tells me it could fall out of you right now and live a long and happy life.
Is it Sam's?
(SCOFFS)
How am I supposed to know with all the secrets you keep?
It's Sam's, and it's a he.
A mini Sam.
Lovely.
Don't do that.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
This is Annalise.
WALLACE:
Tell me what your play is after Immigration has shipped our witness back to Haiti.
They're not shipping her anywhere.
How do you know?
Because I'm the one who put her in there.
How'd you find out?
Does it matter?
Reassure me.
She is gonna show up this time, correct?
Well, clearly
I'm doing everything
I can to make that happen.
Good.
No need for me to keep bothering, then.
(PHONE BEEPS)
Client?
Is something wrong?
No.
I'm out on a limb here, too, Annalise.
Exactly.
That's why the less you know, the better.
Right. That should be your motto.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Why haven't you called me back?
Okay. No. No more of this, especially not today.
What does that mean?
My message, if you listened, was that Philip is back and he's stalking us.
You need to come to Annalise's.
I can't go there.
Did you not hear me?
A serial killer is on the loose.
And Annalise is the reason my mom is dead.
That's not true.
You talked to her?
She asked me where we went, so I told her...
You didn't have the right.
She'll tell you what you want to know if you ask her.
She said that to my face.
Get out.
No, I didn't tell her anything we found.
I trusted you.
Please, you just need to talk to her.
Get out!
You are not safe here.
I'm not safe anywhere.
And definitely not around you.
Get the hell out.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
(MUNCHING)
Hola, chica.
Welcome to
mi safe-o casa.
Safe-a casa?
Guarida.
You made appetizers?
Yeah. It'd be a pretty lame sleepover without pizza bites.
MICHAELA: Where's Wes?
He thinks he's safe at home.
Oh, there's an opt-out button for this little slumber party?
Nope, because I didn't feel like letting you get murdered tonight.
Okay, Mr. Overreacter.
He's not overreacting.
Philip's killed three people in cold blood.
Allegedly.
Okay, let's stop debating about why we're here and instead enjoy these tasty treats that Asher's prepared for us.
Yeah. That's right, yo.
Let's hop on the pizza bite train.
Choo-choo.
Hey, Laurel, you're the calm one here.
Do you think we're in actual physical danger right now?
Do you think I would be sleeping on a couch if I didn't?
Okay, maybe Stanford is our best option. (SIGHS)
ASHER: Stanford?
What the hell does that have to do with anything?
To the end, however it comes first.
Philip's knife or the feds throwing us in jail.
(GLASSES CLINK)
(SIGHS)
So, we gonna talk about it?
You're here with me rather than home banging your girlfriend.
Yeah, she wanted to go to a slumber party.
So, you two aren't fighting?
Whatever.
When are you getting back together with doucheface?
No, that...
(SIGHS)
Let's not talk about them tonight, okay?
We had lives before we met them.
Way better lives.
Right?
Okay, maybe not way better, but...
We weren't covered in blood, at least.
To the end.
To the end.
(GLASSES CLINK)
(SNORES)
MICHAELA:
You're not gonna get in.
Stanford only takes, like, 10 transfers a year, and I know your ranking can't be better than mine.
What's your ranking?
You first.
(SIGHS)
Ninety-six.
(SIGHS)
I win.
Ninety-three.
Don't go.
What?
I can't survive here all alone.
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Don't worry.
I won't get in.
EVE: You need to catch up.
You know you want to.
This is why I didn't want to tell you.
I knew you'd do this.
Do what?
Judge me.
(CHUCKLING) Oh, no, no, no.
Don't put that on me.
You're judging yourself right now, and you know that.
Of course I am.
Of course I am.
Which is why
I don't need you to do it, too.
So then what do you want from me?
Tell you you're glowing, throw you a shower?
I'm terrified, and out of everyone, you should get that.
Oh, I get that. I do.
My question is, why do you need me to talk about that and not your husband?
You never met him.
You don't get to hate him.
I don't hate him.
I just think he's unprofessional.
And yes, we all do unethical things.
Us, right now, for example.
But it doesn't mean
I have to like the man.
Okay, well, that's fine.
Don't like him, but at least be honest about the reason why.
Excuse me?
I left you before I met him.
No, you went to therapy with him because of us.
God. You give yourself too much credit.
Fine, fine, it wasn't me.
It was the fact that I had a vagina.
Oh, God, this has gotten so boring!
Just say it, Annalise.
You didn't have the nerve to tell me back then, but I need you to say it now.
Say what?
That you got scared.
That's why you left me.
No, I left you because I'm not gay.
Bull.
All right?
I needed something in my life, someone who loved me.
You did that, and I loved you back.
But not in a way that either of us deserved.
I don't even know what that means.
It means you live your life, I live mine, straight or gay, whatever you want to call it.
I am gay.
That's what I call it.
All right.
And so do the women
I've happily been with since you ran away like some scared little girl!
Okay, then we both moved on, good for us.
Stop blaming me for your loneliness.
You don't know me at all.
I know you never forgave me.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
(CLEARS THROAT) That's me.
Hello?
All right.
I'll be right there.
(SNIFFLES)
Rose asked to see me.
You sit there, say you can help me if I do what you want.
But what about when I tell them what you are threatening me with?
Destroying my life, my son's life because Annalise has asked you to.
Your son's a citizen, Rose.
He gets to stay here if he wants to.
The same rules don't apply for you, unfortunately.
I will do it.
Good.
I'll have you transported to the courthouse tomorrow.
No. I go home tonight.
No, I can't...
My son has been waiting outside.
He knows nothing.
So, think about what all of this is doing to him.
Let me take him home.
(DOOR BUZZING OPEN)
CHRISTOPHE: Mom.
Are they gonna take you?
No. Mommy fixed it.
No more problems.
Annalise. Why can't you just ask her these questions?
We're not flying to Ohio when I could just ask Annalise.
LAUREL: She doesn't want to see you.
I think you ruined me.
Get out.
Hello?
It's Wes. You there?
What?
Thank you for letting me stay.
Stop it.
Oh, could've stayed at a hotel.
But you want a professional to protect you.
(CHUCKLES)
I know.
I do got a bone to pick with you.
Oh.
You should've called the minute he sent that video of us.
You would've had the SWAT team standing guard outside my house.
So you'd rather just have the D.A.'s office come after you?
I have immunity.
Let's hope.
I shouldn't complain.
It's nice to have another body to keep me warm.
"Another body"?
Sorry.
Another beautiful, brilliant body.
Besides, if anyone is the body here, it's you.
(LAUGHS)
(CHOKING)
ANNALISE: This doesn't prove anything.
Your students were at the crime scene the night my A.D.A. was murdered.
There's no time stamp on the video.
Who knows what night it was?
Why were they running from the house?
I'm not a detective.
Use these e-mails to find Philip.
Make a name for yourself.
This could still be a win for you.
He might have more footage, Annalise, none of which will be covered by your immunity.
So who knows, huh?
Maybe we'll get to see the rest of what happened that night real soon.
You should be a writer.
You're good at making up stories.
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
Holy schnikeys.
Philip just sent an e-mail.
Look.
Oh, my God, is that last night?
I stayed up all night.
It couldn't be.
You just got punked!
(LAUGHS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
I hate you.
You should've seen your face.
You were like, "Ooh."
Is everyone here?
Did they find Philip?
No, but we've got immunity...
If we all keep quiet.
Now, they're gonna come after me and each of you.
Ask questions, play to your weaknesses, but it won't work as long as everyone in this room keeps their mouth shut.
That means no one talks to their priest, their sex buddies, boyfriends, hookers, no one.
That speech would work if we were all here.
Enough about your boyfriend.
Wes, this is an initial report.
Later they ruled it a suicide.
Peritraumatic dissociation.
In the aftermath of a traumatic event, people can get amnesia.
That is true, but...
I remember standing over her holding the knife.
A false memory you might have created to make sense of this report.
Or I'm remembering it exactly right.
Then look at the facts, Wes.
What happened that day?
Were you arrested?
Charged for her murder, assigned a lawyer?
She's gonna do it.
Thank you.
Come on in.
Let's...
Not do the whole apology thing.
Let's forget we ever said anything, and just go out for a nice meal or something.
(SNIFFLES)
What?
(SIGHS)
The baby.
Is something wrong?
No.
Not with it.
With me.
(SNIFFLES)
Miscarriages were easier, you know, because I didn't have to worry, but now this.
He wants to live, and I... (SIGHS)
I'm not ready.
I don't think I'm ready.
You are going to be a great mother.
You don't know that.
Why wouldn't you be?
You've kicked the ass of every other challenge in your life.
Your childhood, Harvard...
Lesbianism.
(CHUCKLES)
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
You can always give him away.
If it turns out you don't like the whole parenting thing, there are tons of people who really want a baby.
I want a baby.
Good.
It means you're ready.
(SNIFFLES)
LAUREL: Do you really not care where he is?
Laurel, I won't say it again.
Is it because you had something to do with his mother being killed?
What did I say?
There is a reason why you are not telling him the truth.
WES: Maybe someone hid the evidence.
MELANIE: Who?
I don't know.
Someone who wanted to protect me.
No one would do that.
Besides, you told me yourself you remember coming home from school that day to find your mom.
You told me that in our first session.
Yeah, well, there's other things
I've done I haven't told you about.
What does that mean?
I know what you and Frank do to people.
What do we do?
Tell me.
(SIGHS)
You know.
Why don't you say it?
Say it.
Or are you just upset because we cover up murders to save your asses again and again, and this is what you call a "thank you"?
All I'm asking you to do is to talk to him, make him come here.
Otherwise he could get hurt, or hurt himself, or say too much.
But that's not on me anymore.
(SNIFFLES)
It's on you.
WES: I'm not the person you think I am.
And I can't tell you what that means or what I've done, so don't ask me. Just...
You need to believe me when I say it's possible...
I could've killed her.
I don't want to leave.
Fait vite.
You said everything was okay.
I lied, okay?
We're not safe here.
So, help me pack.
MELANIE: I'm not going to push you to explain.
But I do want you to at least consider the possibility that you didn't do this, that this is your brain making things up.
ROSE: We'll find a motel, maybe one with a pool.
Then what?
We just live in a motel for the rest of our lives?
No. We'll get a place, nicer than any we've had so far.
I just want to go home.
Stop this, okay?
I made up my mind.
Someday you will understand, but today, I need you to listen to me.
Christophe, come back here!
Christophe!
Christophe!
MELANIE: You're tired, and upset, and traumatized, which is understandable.
But that doesn't mean you had anything to do with your mother's death.
You were a 12-year-old boy, and your mother was in the middle of an extremely stressful situation.
Which is why what you've been told your whole life, that this was a suicide, makes a lot of sense here.
Much more than her getting murdered.
CHRISTOPHE: Mom?
(ROSE CHOKING)
Mommy.
No.
Mommy, please.
What happened?
(SOBS) Mommy, no!
LAUREL: What now?
You want to show me where you offed Rebecca?
Stop, please.
There was a reason it took me so long to tell you,
'cause I didn't know where we stood, but I do now.
Or at least I know what I feel.
I love you, Laurel.
I thought I was gonna lose you, and it made me sick, so I told you the thing
I haven't told anyone.
Which proves you love me?
When you're as screwed up as me, yeah.
Please, Laurel,
I don't know a lot, but I love you.
You killed an innocent girl.
Strangled her on a roof.
And for what?
To make Annalise happy?
Do you think that's the type of person
I want to love me?
It's not.
And the truth is,
I don't love you back.
(SNIFFLES)
So, we're done.
It's over.
And I won't tell anyone else.
Not to protect you,
but to protect them.
(SNIFFLES)
'Cause if they knew any of this,
after everything we've been through,
I can't do that to them, Frank.
CHRISTOPHE: Mom?
Mommy.
No.
Mommy, please.
What happened?
I want a baby.
Good.
It means you're ready.
(SNIFFLES)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Is it Sam?
(SIGHS)
I wish.
I presume you're aware that our witness is no longer in custody?
She'll be on the stand tomorrow as promised.
She tried to leave town.
Glad one of us is paying attention.
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah, she's back at her apartment.
I'll go there right now.
Hold on.
I understand if you think that I am a bad person.
I'm just a parent trying to protect my son.
Any minute now, you'll be doing the same for your child.
Tell Rose that if she wants to protect her son, then she also needs to protect mine.
You touch that boy and I guarantee you
Charles goes to jail.
Well, let's hope we don't get there.
(SIGHS)
Wes?
It's me, Annalise.
I want to talk.
I thought you were Christophe.
He's not here?
No.
We were in the car.
I was driving.
He just ran.
I can't call anyone or they'll take him away from me.
They won't do that.
Your lady threatened they would.
She didn't mean that.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
And I hate that I did that, but that's in the past.
You're involved now, and so am I, and these people...
Yeah, I know these people.
Then you know you need to do this for Christophe.
What did he say to you?
Mr. Mahoney.
Did he threaten Christophe?
Yes.
You tell him no.
Listen.
I am not on their side.
But I will protect you if you do this.
You can't.
Yeah, I can.
You don't know what that man is capable of.
What do you mean?
Rose, tell me.
It's too late.
No, Rose.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Wes, please,
I know you're in there because I can see the light on.
Wes?
He doesn't own me or Christophe.
We are not things to be owned, and used, and thrown away.
I was born free,
I will stay free, so will Christophe.
You tell him that.
Okay. I will.
(SOBS)
There's no reason to hurt him now.
What do you mean?
Take care of my boy.
Rose, no!
(ANNALISE GASPS)
(ROSE CHOKING)
Rose. (PANTING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(ROSE CHOKING)
(FLOORBOARD CREAKING)
(PANTING)
(DOOR CLOSES)
Mom?
Mommy.
What happened?
ROSE: (SOBS) I'm sorry.
CHRISTOPHE: No.
What happened?
(SOBS) Mommy, no.
Mom. No.
(CHOKES)
Mom. (SOBS)
Wes?
I'm gonna come in now, all right?
Wes?
(SIGHS)
(GAGGING)
(DIALING)
FEMALE DISPATCHER:
911. What's your emergency?
Something bad happened.
(GAGGING)
You don't have to hide from me.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(GASPS)
(SIGHS)
Now is not a good time.
EVE: I don't care.
Eve.
Wes is here.
What?
I just came home from a date, and he was waiting in my lobby.
He found my name
on his mother's
immigration documents,
and he wants to know how I know her.
Call 911.
What?
There's someone in Wes' apartment.
Ah!
(ANNALISE GRUNTING)

## S02E14

Previously on "How To Get Away With Murder"... 
- Philip Jessup... He's been watching us.
- What do you want?
Blanket immunity to cover me and my associates.
Why would you need immunity for that night?
You killed an innocent girl.
Strangled her on a roof.
Is it true? Did Wes kill his mother?
I remember standing over her holding the knife.
A false memory you might have created to make sense of this report.
- Wes is here.
- What?
He was waiting in my lobby.
- Call 911.
- What?
There's someone in Wes' apartment!
Aah!
[Grunting]
[Grunting]
- Annalise?
- Get away from me! Aah!
Wes, call 911!
Send them to your apartment.
Stop fighting!
Annalise?
- Stop! Just...
- Annalise!
[Screaming]

Oh, thank God.
Did he hurt you?
I'm fine. Where's Wes?
He was right behind me.
Eve: Ms. Keating.
Where were you?
Take care of my boy.
Rose, no!
Meeting with the Mahoneys.
Has he been charged?
Not yet.
Christophe: You think I'm going to freak out if I know she hurt herself.
I don't think you're gonna freak out.
All I know is they took her to the hospital.
Oh.
She looked dead when I found her.
- Very dead.
- Good God, Annalise.
What did we do?
We didn't do anything. It was a suicide.
We don't know that.
You really think that boy is capable of stabbing his mother in the neck?
All I'm saying is, why would she do this?
Leave her son, when... from what I could see... she only wanted to protect him.
Trying to make sense out of something that doesn't make sense.
You're an expert on a crime scene you've never been to?
I read the report. The angle of the knife, the position of the body, no signs of a struggle.
Does the FBI really want to participate in the railroading of an innocent black kid who should be grieving his dead mother?
Relax. No one thinks he did it.
But that doesn't mean it's suicide, especially when you take into account who'd want to see this woman dead.
She was our only alibi.
In what world would my clients want her dead?
An alibi who never showed up in court.
Tell your clients they can expect a visit from me.
- Finally.
- You all right?
- We thought you were killed.
- Why was Philip at Wes' apartment?
- Did he really punch you?
- Do the cops know where he is?
The woman was just attacked. Give her a moment before you start the Inquisition.
I'm not hurt, but nobody goes anywhere by themselves until the police catch him. Nobody.
Come on. Up you go.
Why is Eve here?
Why was Philip in your apartment?
- I don't know.
- You have to know something.
You were at the police station all night.
Exactly. I need to sleep.
How was your date?
Excuse me?
On the phone last night, you mentioned you had a date.
Oh.
Not my soul mate.
Younger?
Can we just talk about Wes here?
Why did you give him the file if you weren't gonna tell him the truth?
I don't know.
You always know what you're doing.
Okay, I get it.
You feel like you owe him something, as do I, but... he's not a child, or your child.
He's a man, and he can handle the truth.
How did this become my life?
Because you're messed up, like all of us.
[Chuckles]
Drive back to New York with me.
I have a doorman, 24-hour security...
You'll be safe.
Nate'll make sure I'm okay.
[Knock on door]
Come in.
Nate's here.
[Chuckles] Of course.
Michaela: How did this happen?
At this stage, we're just gathering information.
Why weren't they watching him, though?
We... we gave them the videos.
They knew Philip was in town...
Hey. We don't know anything yet.
- Don't jump to any conclusions.
- About what?
This is all your fault.
We could've warned him.
Who?
Caleb.
He's missing.
This is... this is all your fault.
[Shuddered breathing]
Where the hell you been?
- Police station.
- What?
Why didn't you call me?
Our star witness just killed herself.
I had more important matters to attend to.
Okay, yeah, I know. I just...
- What do you need?
- To sleep.
You're kidding, right? We go back into court tomorrow.
I'm not sure we're working on this case anymore.
- What?
- I just need to rest, Frank.
Wallace: Hello?
Dude, what the hell?
The door was open. May I have a moment?
No. She'll call you when she's ready.
Give us a minute, Frank.
I'm not gonna leave you alone.
That's exactly what you're gonna do.
I got to the apartment, the cops were already there, so I left.
So that's that.
No apology?
What would I need to apologize for?
Losing my son's trial, for one.
I haven't lost anything yet.
How exactly do you plan on winning this when our only alibi in the morgue?!
- You did this.
- Excuse me?
She was terrified of you. Tell me why.
If you're claiming that she killed herself because of the pressure to testify, that's on you, not me.
You made me threaten her.
She saw Charles at the office that night and refused to tell anyone about it.
That was a lie. She wasn't there, and you knew she would lie for you because... why?
Careful.
I am the one person that knows you were on your way to speak to Rose right before she ended up dead.
You talk to me like that again and you're fired.
Nate: They got every street cop on the lookout.
Eve: That should make her feel better, considering how effective you guys have been
- at catching Philip so far.
- We're on it.
Oh, right. Like you were last night?
That was before we knew she was in any danger.
Oh, so she had to get assaulted for you to realize that creep might come after her?
Stop!
I'm not some chew toy to fight over.
Right. Well...
I'll be off, then.
- Eve...
- It's fine.
[Door opens]
- You're leaving?
- Yep.
We still need to talk about my mother.
No, you don't.
This is between you and me.
We'll talk.
When?
Once everything calms down.
Bonnie: Annalise.
That was A.D.A. Denver.
He wants to interview everyone who was on video at the mansion.
Denver: You seem distraught.
Look at your face.
Why?
What was going on this night that had you so emotional?
I don't recall.
You don't recall running from the mansion on the same night that
Emily Sinclair was killed?
There's no time stamp on this footage, so you... and we... don't actually know what night this is.
Exactly.
And people have told me that
I have a resting bitch face, so that's probably what you're reading as "distraught."
You're a good student.
Too good to not realize it's unethical to have a sexual relationship with a client.
Past client.
We were done representing Caleb at the point we became romantic.
- Is that true?
- Excuse me?
Just wondering. Will Caleb confirm that your relationship started after your working relationship?
Find him. Maybe we'll find out.
- Where are you from?
- Why does that matter?
Please tell your client to answer the question.
I am allowed to ask questions if I don't understand the purpose of yours...
Laurel. Just answer.
Originally, Mexico.
But I lived in Florida before law school.
Why does it matter where I was?
Because there was an alleged murderer in your apartment last night, and you just happened to be out of town.
My client and I will leave if you turn this into interrogation.
What she said.
And I was in New York, if you have to know.
- Why?
- It's New York.
Do I really need an excuse to want to visit?
Caleb was at your apartment the night Emily Sinclair died.
Because that's what you told him to do, according to this statement.
If it's written right there, then why bother asking me?
Because you're the one claiming that you weren't having a romantic relationship with him at this time, yet here he is, alone at your place.
Esta gente te traicionarÃ¡ a la primera oportunidad.
He thinks you and Annalise are gonna sell me out.
Se me hace que eres una chica lista... 
Now he's calling me smart because he thinks
I'm dumb enough to fall for this Latino besties schtick.
Why was Annalise there?
That sounds like a question for her.
- It's your apartment.
- Which he wasn't at.
Come on. He must know why his professor was making a night call to his apartment.
Is that typical for you two?
- What are you offering?
- Immunity, to whichever one of you is the first to cut a deal.
- We have immunity.
- For the night Sinclair died.
But what happens when every other illegal act you've committed shows up?
Philip is probably chopping up Caleb into little pieces right now, so it seems to me you should be trying to find him instead of...
... interrogating us and making insinuations when really, you know nothing.
Pero no, porque usted prefiere abrir un caso que ya ha resuelto.
So good luck screwing me.
Because you're not really my type.
How'd it go?
Crushed it. Don't know about these fools.
- Bitch-slapped his ass.
- He's got nothing.
Hey, BonBon.
- This isn't right.
- What isn't?
Everyone taking the heat for this when I'm the one that started it all.
You want to take the rap, relax.
You'll get plenty of chances.
- Frank...
- Dude's not wrong.
We wouldn't be here if not for his lead foot.
Wow. Thanks for the support, Beard-o.
- Asher didn't start this.
- Yeah... I did.
No, this started with Lila.
The person who killed her is the one who should blame themselves for everything.
You mean Sam or Rebecca?
Look, whatever. It doesn't matter.
Look, I-I did what I did, and I'm the only one responsible for that.
You can call it a mistake or a moment of crazy.
Either way, everyone is suffering because of me,
- and I need to own up to...
- [Door opens]
So it was Laurel?
She spilled to you?
So you admit it?
Would denying it do me much good at this point?
Is it Annalise?
She made you do this?
- This conversation's over.
- Frank...
Seems hypocritical to judge me when we're standing a few feet from where you offed Rebecca.
Keep your mouth shut.
Then we got no problems.
Don't tell me you two are boning.
When have I ever been into blondes?
Laurel drama.
Excuse me? Check, please.
Room 512.
Are you coming?
You ever been to Fishtown?
[Chuckles]
[Knock on door]
We still fighting?
How'd it go with Wallace?
Not good.
You want to talk about it?
Why are you here, anyway?
Didn't I tell you to leave me alone?
You know, you brought me here to help you.
But if all I'm gonna get is abuse from you...
- Abuse?
- Yeah.
All you do is rip on me.
I'll go get another job if you hate me so much.
Oh, please. Sam dragged you out of the gutter, then guilted me into hiring you, and all I've done is baby your ass ever since.
You call that abuse, then you deserve whatever white-trash future I was trying to save you from.
Glad you got that off your chest.
Did Bonnie see?
No.
Good. Get out.
[Sighs]
[Cellphone rings]
[Sighs]
She's still avoiding you?
I get it. You're mad because I went behind your back to Annalise...
No, I'm mad because you lied to me.
What?
She gave you this?
I found it on her desk.
Wes, please...
You didn't kill her.
You don't know that.
Asher: Excuse me, everyone, if
I could have your attention.
I would like to offer all of you an apology.
- Asher...
- Just let me say this.
Uh, I'm... sorry for ruining your lives.
Uh, yeah... I don't know.
Maybe none of this would've happened if you all hadn't killed Sam, or if whoever hadn't killed Lila...
You mean if Sam didn't kill Lila?
Like we actually know that.
Anyway, the point is, I messed up and made you all stick your necks out on the line for me, and...
I just want to say... thank you.
Thank you for protecting me after I, you know...
- killed...
- Okay. Can we not say that?
I mean, Oliver's about to be here.
I'd rather he not hear any of this.
Maybe he should hear it.
Look what happened when I didn't tell Caleb that Philip was back.
He's probably dead, but if I had just told him the truth...
No one is telling our sweet O the truth.
Isn't lying to him all the time worse?
I mean, I pretend that we're okay and that this is the best relationship I've ever been in, but that's a lie, too, so...
And you think telling him you're a killer is going to help?
Bonnie: You tell Oliver anything and it's all over.
We go to jail. Stop apologizing.
We're all bad people.
That's the only thing we have in common.
[Door opens]
Oliver: Hello?
- Hello?
- O-Man!
Hey. Sorry.
I know I was supposed to come here straight here from work, what with our bestie
Philip roaming the streets, but I thought you'd all be hungry.
You're the best.
Maybe I should turn gay just so I could date you.
[Cellphone ringing]
Let me guess. Caleb's dead.
No. But still no sign of Philip.
How's the arm feeling?
Oh. It's fine. Vodka helps.
So, you're gonna stay put, right?
No running off to campus... or New York?
That wasn't what you think.
I know. It was about Wes.
He told the detectives he wasn't at his apartment
'cause he was visiting Eve in New York.
So it's true.
- Yes.
- And this is normal?
Wes paying house calls to your ex-girlfriends?
Of course not.
- Nate?
- Yeah?
Thank you for checking in on me.
Hey, I'm just trying to keep Eve off my ass.
Talk later.
[Chvrches' "ZVVL" plays]
âª So, I think it's time âª
âª To face yourself again âª
âª It's not too late âª
That's mine over there... in the blue.
Another hit for the win!
You can find another witness.
I know you can find someone.
I can't.
You're just as bad as them.
âª We both are free âª
Take care of my boy.
Rose, no!
[Cellphone dialing]
âª On your own âª
[Ringing]
âª Open up, give it up âª
Why would you even think about doing this?
To protect the boy.
That boy isn't your client, Annalise.
Which is why you need to do it.
Just tell the agent that Rose told you that she was threatened by the Mahoney family.
That's why she was willing to lie on the stand.
Eve, please.
Now, I'd do it myself, but I'd get disbarred...
Or worse!
These people are dangerous, especially if what you're telling me is true, so stop it.
What happened to that boy is sad but... sad things happen to all of us.
- Fine. I'll do it myself.
- No, Annalise!
âª Truth, it's just as real âª
[Door opens, closes]
âª As your dream at night âª
This is concerning Rose Edmond.
More specifically, her son.
I'm the defense attorney working on the Mahoney case, and I have information that
Agent Kain would like to know.
I'm on my way to the station right now.
Woman: Okay. She should be available to meet you.
Great. I'll be there soon.
- âª We start today âª
- [Sighs]
âª Open up, give it up, go âª
[Sighs]
Sorry.
Start over.
Hey, do you mind if I sit here?
No. Go for it.
I'm Bonnie.
We're in the same ConLaw class.
Oh, right, yeah. Uh, I'm Mike.
Yeah, I can't do this. Ugh.
- You can!
- It's too pathetic.
Okay. I can show you tons of research that proves getting your anxiety out in roleplay allows you to not experience it in real life.
- I don't care. It's...
- Yes, you do.
Bonnie, you told me this guy is a... a... a friendly nerd, right?
So who better to humiliate yourself in front of?
Right? [Chuckles]
Yeah.
[Cellphone vibrating]
Sorry, just let me...
Hello?
Yes, I'm her husband.
Man: She's awake!
The baby. How's the baby?
We're taking you in for a C-section right now.
Why? Is he dead?
- Annalise, I need you to stay calm.
- Is he dead?
Is he dead? Tell me!
We haven't been able to find a heartbeat, but that doesn't mean that this is over.
Okay, babies at this stage are resilient,
[echoing] which is why we're taking you into the O.R. right now.
What's important is that you stay calm.
Your husband's on his way.
You are in good hands, and so is your baby.
We're hopeful, and that's all you need to focus on.
[Knock on door]
Bonnie: Annalise?
Come in.
What's wrong?
Denver just called again.
He wants to interview me.
D-did he say why?
No. Which is bad, right?
I mean, I wasn't in any of those videos, but he still knows I'm involved anyway?
He's just trying to scare us.
Talk to him, you'll be all right.
Will I?
'Cause I haven't done these like everyone else, who seem to be really good at them.
You will be, too.
And you know why?
Because you're smarter than people think.
Where were you at 8:30 p.m. the night Emily Sinclair was murdered?
Uh, that was a long time ago so I... I don't know.
- I think you remember.
- Except I don't.
Well, let me remind you, then. You were here.
Well, the parking garage to be more specific.
[Engine revs, tires screech]
I'm sorry. What proof do you have of this?
An eyewitness by the name of Susan Grundy.
Need some help?
She also happens to be the secretary of one of my colleagues.
She saw a photo of Mr.
Millstone when we were doing the research-gathering on the Keating firm.
Could be anyone. I'm just a generic white guy.
- It's...
- He works in a law firm.
His being in a courthouse parking garage proves nothing.
Well, I find it very interesting that the last place Ms.
Sinclair was seen alive is the same place that
Mr. Millstone was seen.
Add to this that your father died the same day, and, well...
Any reasonable person would be suspicious.
Can I grab you in the kitchen for a second?
No. I've got to tend to this food coma.
Did you two break up or something?
Seriously. When did that happen?
I forget.
Oliver: Aw, why'd you guys break up?
Your names combine to make Flaurel, which is kind of perfectly romantic.
Not as cool as Bosher.
Except Bosher doesn't exist anymore.
You really want to know why we broke up?
I think Frank shot Annalise that night.
I thought Catherine shot Annalise.
Yeah, but the D.A.'s theory is that Annalise had Frank shoot her and made it look like Catherine did it.
Michaela: Whoa. Oliver, are you sure this pizza wasn't laced with something?
- Do you really believe that?
- You're insane.
And you're even more insane for buying this.
Okay, I don't want to, but if... if... if you think that there's even a chance that this could be true, then...
One of you needs to tell the police!
What the hell was that?
- I did you a favor.
- How?
He freaked out at the idea we framed Catherine, so imagine if he knew the truth.
You chopping up Sam's body, for example...
Stop.
Fine. Just...
You're welcome for saving your relationship.
Bonnie: I thought you stopped drinking.
I did.
Hand me the bottle.
Bonnie...
You have a house full of terrified people out there counting on you.
Oh, like they haven't seen me drunk before.
We're all tired, Annalise...
Well, I'm the only one who got beaten up by that little bitch, so, no, you don't get to compare your feelings to mine right now.
Fine.
So, what were you and
Frank talking about, huh?
If you're not sleeping together, then what is it?
Come on.
I always find out eventually.
We were talking about Wes.
There has to be a reason he hasn't been around here lately.
Why you were at his apartment last night...
Everything's always about Wes.
I'm the one who gets beaten, I'm fighting to keep all of us safe, and all you people do is whine about Wes!
Because this is killing you, making you drink.
You protect him more than you should...
And what?
- Does that make you jealous?
- Who is he, Annalise?
Did Wes put you up to this? Is that it?
No. I'm asking you...
Well, you don't get to do that!
Not about this.
I'm sick of all of you.
Get out.
- Get out!
- Ow!
Everyone leave!
Uh, we can't, remember?
Philip's out there?
For reals. Has someone had a few too many?
A whole bottle of vodka, and if you all had balls, you'd be drunk, too.
So go!
Carpe diem before this whole ship goes down.
Wait, wait. What is that supposed to mean?
W-What is this, a homeless shelter?
What are you doing? Get out!
Go somewhere else.
Except you, Wes. Get in my office.
âª Dancing with you undercover âª
âª Feels like there are no more lovers âª
Asher: So, uh, you sad your boo's not here?
- âª Left to discover âª
- What?
Don't think I haven't noticed you and our puppy getting all cozy wozy.
I mean, that's why you and Frank broke up, right?
- Am I right or am I right?
- You're wrong.
And, uh, I'm gonna go throw up now.
Careful!
There's a killer albino on the loose.
âª And I feel âª
âª That it's real âª
Oliver: You think I'm weak and that I can't handle your secrets.
That's not true.
What about what Laurel said?
About Annalise making Frank shoot her?
You had to have known that.
Okay, can we not announce that to the whole bar?
I've got secrets, too.
Like... ?
Guess.
- Oli...
- [Chuckles]
I quit my job last week!
- What?
- [Laughs]
- Why?
- I don't know. I...
Maybe it's getting diagnosed.
Maybe it's being around you, and... everybody in the house, but...
I finally decided that, from now on,
I'm gonna live my life.
Carpe diem, like Annalise said.
Don't take life advice from Annalise.
- Do you think she'd hire me?
- No. I won't let her.
And whatever you say goes?
Oli, you don't want to work for her.
Whatever. We can discuss this tomorrow.
Right now, let's carpe the dance floor.
- Oh.
- [Laughs]
âª And I feel âª
âª That it's real âª
[Bottle opens]
[Liquid pours]
You sure you need that?
I'm sure.
And so will you.
Drink.
I blame myself for everything that happened.
Woman: Scalpel. Woman âª2: Scalpel.
âª Once we tried to make a life âª
- Retractors.
- Here you go.
Where is our neonatologist?
- âª Chasing birds âª
- Woman 3: Scrubbing in.
Bovie.
Hemostat.
âª In the dead of night âª
[Monitors beeping]
âª Our kin will try to understand âª
Man: He's out.
âª What we âª
Suction.
âª Always understood âª
Annalise: I wanted to win the case...
... to the point that I let the clients get in my head.
So I did what they wanted.
I put pressure on your mother to lie.
She couldn't take it, so she hurt herself.
Eve: At least tell me if she's okay.
Patient information can only be released to family members.
How does telling me if she's okay hurt anyone?
I'm sorry, ma'am.
âª Once we tried to make a life âª
My wife, Annalise Keating... she was in a car accident.
- I.D.?
- Here.
Thank you, Mr. Keating. I'll have someone come get you.
Uh, what does that mean? Is she okay?
I-I don't get medical updates, but I'll get someone here to speak to you right away.
[Sighs]
âª Our kin will try to understand âª
WOMAN: Mr. Keating?
- Yeah.
- Come with me.
All right.
âª What we always understood âª
[Monitors beeping rapidly]
[Air hissing rhythmically]
[Switch clicks, beeping stops]
He didn't... ?
I'm so sorry.
Annalise: It's my fault she died, Wes.
If I didn't want to win so bad, put so much pressure on her...
[Crying]
No.
[Sniffles]
[Door opens]
[Sniffles]
[Crying continues]
I let my ambition get the better of me...
Uh...
And you lost your mother as a result, and...
I blame myself for... all of it.
[Breathing heavily]
Annalise: Sorry.
[Sniffles]
I'm so sorry.
[Sighs]
I'm so sorry.
[Sniffles] Sorry.
[Crying]
Oh, God!
It was an accident, Annie.
A witness said the driver blew a red light...
I shouldn't have been here.
I should have stayed home, turned down the case...
None of that would've changed anything.
Of course it would have.
I did this to him. I did it.
- No, you didn't.
- I did. [Sniffles]
Woman: Would you like a picture?
What?
A picture of the three of you.
We've found most parents appreciate having at least one photo.
[Breathing heavily]
Okay.
[Camera shutter clicks]
Here.
Annie, they said to take as much time as we need just...
And I'm done.
Please take him.
Please take him.
Take him.
[Sniffles]
Take him!
Take him!
Please take him! Take him!
Sam?
You don't know me.
I'm a... a colleague of Annalise's.
I'm sort of involved in the Mahoney case.
Oh, right, right. Hi.
I asked the nurse for an update, but they won't tell me.
- I'm not family, so...
- Um, uh...
Annalise is, uh... she's fine.
But the baby...
[Sniffles lightly]
He's, uh...
[Voice breaking] I am so sorry.
Um...
Tell them she's... she's off that case.
- What?
- Whoever needs to know.
Um...
[Voice breaking] She's not working that... that case anymore.
I'm... I'm taking her home.
I will tell them.
Thanks.
Here.
A little flavor might help.
[Liquid pours]
[Indistinct announcement over P.A. system]
Annie.
We'll get through this.
Wes: I don't believe you.
That this was just about that case or that she killed herself because of it.
Otherwise, you could've just told me.
I'm done believing you when you promise me you're telling the truth.
All I've ever done is try to protect you.
Protect me from what?!
Sam: Annie. We'll get through this.
Careful.
I am the one person that knows you were on your way to speak to Rose right before she ended up dead.
You talk to me like that again, and you're fired.
She was so scared of you that she killed herself.
In what world would a mother do that?
- Ms. Keating...
- She said it to my face that she was afraid that you would hurt her son.
Now, why would she think that, that killing herself would stop you from hurting her son?!
'Cause I can only think of one reason...
- Okay, move or I...
- You raped her.
I saw it in her eyes.
You violated her.
How many times did you do it?
For how many years?
You don't even know because she was nobody to you.
And then came that boy, your son, Christophe.
Now you're fired.
Wes: No.
My father, he... he's dead.
No.
He's very much alive, and his name is Wallace Mahoney.
âª You awoke into my night âª
âª You could see âª
- âª The madness in my eyes âª
- Hey, Caleb.
I know you probably won't get this, but...
I just wanted to say that I'm thinking about you a lot, and...
Asher: Was that Caleb?
Still no answer, huh?
[Exhales sharply, sniffles]
I should've told him Philip was back.
Annalise said you couldn't.
[Scoffs] I should've ignored her.
She would've killed you.
Like, worse than Philip's probably killing Caleb right now.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That was... That was a terrible joke.
[Chuckles] The worst.
Sorry. You know why I know that?
'Cause that's me.
I'm the worst.
So you want to take it out on someone, take it out on me.
Come on. Hit me.
Hit me!
Come on. Make me feel it.
Hit me.
Harder.
Harder!
[Panting]
[Moaning]
- We shouldn't do this.
- I know.
- It's so messed up.
- My boyfriend's missing.
He'll turn up.
You're right. [Grunts]
âª Oh, my God, you're beautiful âª
[Moans, chuckles]
âª Why do you stay with this neurotic fool? âª
[Both moan]
âª I've lost control âª
âª Please save me from myself âª
âª I've lost control âª
âª Please save me from myself âª
âª I've lost control âª
âª Please save me from myself âª
[Inhales sharply]
[Crying]
[Knock on door]
Do I need to be scared, or can I come in?
No, it doesn't make sense.
That Annalise knew about
Sam and Lila all that time, defended Rebecca when it would've been smarter just to let her get convicted.
You did it for Sam.
She can't know.
[Knock on door]
Why are you here?
I wanted to find out what happened with you and Wes.
Why is that any of your business?
I don't know.
Maybe because you've ruined all my relationships since I got here.
[Sniffles]
You came between me and
Frank. Now me and Wes.
You know what? You're drunk. You need to go home.
No, not until you tell me what you said to him.
- I said go home.
- What did you tell him?
- That he killed his mother?
- Laurel...
Or was it that you're the one that ordered Frank to kill Lila?
What did you just say?
Oh, yeah. Frank told me... that he killed Lila because you asked him to do it.
Which makes all the sense in the world... that you started all of this.
Sam was cheating on you with a younger woman.
And then she's pregnant?
So why not use your trusty hit man to get rid of her and then play all of us like your little puppets as we defend Rebecca, kill Sam... ?
It was all you all along...
[Echoing] All along...
âª Oh, my God, you're beautiful âª
âª Why do you stay with this neurotic fool? âª
[Knock on door]
- âª I've lost control âª
- Annalise!
- âª Please save me from myself âª
- [Laughing]
There's my baby. She come home.
âª I've lost control

Get Away with Murder"...
- Explain the cash.
- Hush money for Rebecca.
Stanford. I want you to come with me.
Your students were at the crime scene the night my A.D.A. was murdered.
Use these e-mails to find Philip.
Stop fighting me!
They knew Philip was in town.
- What?
- Caleb. He's missing.
Nobody goes anywhere by themselves until the police catch him.
I blame myself for all of it.
- Take him!
- You raped her.
And then came that boy, your son, Christophe.
My father, he's dead.
He's very much alive, and his name is Wallace Mahoney.
You did it for Sam.
She can't know.
You're the one that ordered Frank to kill Lila.
There's my baby! She come home!
- You were the last person to see her.
- We don't know that.
Well, we do know that she kicked everyone out of the house except for you.
Seriously, what did she want to talk to you about?
That's none of your business.
Annalise is missing. Caleb is missing.
Everything's our business now.
- Annalise is missing?
- Where have you been?
Hung over. Where'd she go?
Do you need us to define the word "missing" for you?
Oh, can everyone stop yelling, please?
I can hack into her credit cards.
- Perfect.
- O-man to the rescue.
- No one's hacking Annalise.
- Are you sure?
Nate hasn't seen her since yesterday.
What time did you leave here last night?
I don't know. 9:00?
And do you have someone that can vouch for your whereabouts after that?
- Do you?
- Yeah. He's sitting right there.
Shouldn't we be calling the police?
No, no, no, O-man. We don't trust the po-po in this house.
- I need to talk to you.
- Not now.
Frank.
I was drunk and mad and stupid, but I told her I wouldn't tell anyone else, so it doesn't really make sense, right, that it's related to why she's gone?
- It does.
- Why?
Frank, just tell me.
Room 512.
Are you coming?
You ever been to Fishtown?
Wait.
Something wrong?
What's better than sex?
You think I'm a gigolo?
I know what you are.
So, you want to change your life, or are you happy just to stay
Annalise Keating's bitch?
Frank.
Just tell me.
We found her.
Well, Oliver did.
She bought a plane ticket to Memphis.
- What's in Memphis?
- Her mother.
Why would she go there?
You want to tell her?
Celestine!
I'm sorry.
I forgot you're around murderers all the time.
You were snoring so nice.
I thought I was 10 years old again.
You just home from work?
I stopped by to check on Mama, but only got two words in before she told me to quiet my loud mouth so as not to wake you.
I figured she'd come down with a spontaneous case of dementia.
She said she's not sure how long you're staying.
Fine. I won't pry.
Unless that's why you came.
You need to stop right there, or else I'm gonna make you leave.
- Make me?
- Mm-hmm.
This is more my room than yours.
I only see my trophies over there.
You still haven't lost that big head.
That's 'cause I can back it up.
It's your big head you can back up?
And I could still back that up, too.
Didn't I send you up here about an hour ago?
Anna Mae wouldn't let me leave.
Anna Mae begging you to leave just so she can get her some more sleep.
The answer's no.
In a few minutes, you'll have some people coming up here.
And you up under these covers looking like "Who shot John?"
Girl, get up and get in the shower.
Oh, Mama.
What's wrong with you? You stupid?
You think we won't have a little get-together when we know you're back?
Get in the shower, Anna Mae.
I said get in the shower!
It's just a few people.
I'm lying. It's everyone.

Relax.
I told them the first person to bring up any of your drama gets kicked out.
No banana pudding.
Anna Mae!
Look who's come on home to the holler!
Oh, Auntie, you're so country.
Is that Michelle Obama?!
We just glad to have you for a visit, cuz.
You ready to jump on a plane back to Philly?
Oh, you and all this hair.
Where did she come from?
Somewhere fancy, I'm guessing.
Hey, listen, did, uh, Celestine tell you about Marlene?
Don't, Theo.
Oh, I'm telling her this story.
Marlene comes down here last year.
You know, Christmas, right?
She bragging about her new boyfriend down in Atlanta.
That's where she living.
He's some old big-money guy, works finance.
You know, fancy car this, diamond earring that.
These suits are too good to go to waste.
Stop it.
Thelonius can use them for his job search.
Now, who does she want to call? You.
Like you gonna help her sad-ass boyfriend that she been knowing for two months?
Please.
You got this pot on too high.
Nice, isn't it?
Hmm?
All those people still love you.
I tried to stop them from coming, but the minute they heard you were in town...
"The minute they heard"?
You're lucky to find any of us here.
Going to funerals is all I've been doing ever since the last time I saw you.
You know, Buddy and Jacklyn.
I just thank God I didn't have to add you to the list.
Mama. Look at me. I'm here, I'm better.
Better than being shot up.
But that doesn't make you all better.
Otherwise, why would you drag your behind out here?
I'm your daughter, and I miss you.
Is that a fact?
Want to help me?
Go get me some butter from the refrigerator, baby.
Well, you're not gonna get it standing there.
I asked you to stay outside.
I know, but it's not every day a daddy hears his baby girl's come home for a visit.
How you doing, Anna Mae?
Anna Mae?
What's better than sex?
I know what you are.
You want to change your life?
Or are you happy just to stay
Annalise Keating's bitch?
Why are you here, anyway?
Didn't I tell you to leave me alone?
You know, you brought me here to help you.
But if all I get is abuse from you...
- Abuse?
- Yeah.
All you do is rip on me.
I'll go get another job if you hate me so much.
Oh, please. Sam dragged you out of the gutter, then guilted me into hiring you, and all I've done is baby your ass ever since.
You call that abuse, then you deserve whatever white-trash future I was trying to save you from.
Glad you got that off your chest.
What the hell are they gonna arrest her for?
All I heard was the
D.A.'s getting a warrant.
But only for Annalise.
As far as I know.
But she has immunity for that night.
Right.
And you guys don't do any other illegal crap around here?
You two do something stupid?
We're always doing stupid things.
Never made her jump ship before.
There's an arrest warrant for Annalise.
What are they charging her with?
He doesn't know.
Hey, Oliver.
Aren't you in the mood to do a little hacking?
No. He doesn't do that anymore.
- I can speak for myself.
- No, you can't.
And let me remind everyone how we pissed off a sociopath the last time we let him hack something for us.
Right, but this is just the police, so it's not as dangerous.
For once, I agree with Connor.
We're in enough trouble with the police already.
It's for Annalise. We need a copy of her warrant.
Annalise would stop this, too, if she were here.
No.
Does he come here a lot?
Tell me, Mama.
We've been seeing each other.
You see.
I knew you'd get that judgy look on your face.
So you're back together?
Well, you can call it courtship, dating, or anything you want.
- I just call it "nice."
- For how long?
Were you with him when you visited me?
I would've told you if I were.
Well, since when, then?
Well, we heard that you'd been shot and stopped by to see how you were doing.
So it's all my fault.
I did not say that.
After everything that he's done...
You act like he beat me.
No, the worst thing he did was to move across town.
How do you know he's not gonna leave again?
I don't.
But you live to be as old as I am and see if you don't eat a cupcake when it's placed before you.
It's a little above your head, but you'll get used to it.
I won't.
Well, then don't.
- Mama!
- Lavinia?
- Yeah?
- Listen, baby.
I want you to hide this telephone from Auntie, okay?
I hate you.
You love me.
Everybody love me.
Don't.
You okay?
No, not really.
You?
Annalise was protecting me.
That's what she says.
'Cause, according to her,
Wallace Mahoney is my father.
Wes...
I know. She's... probably lying.
Again.
He lives in New York.
Okay. No. You cannot...
I need to at least find out if it's true.
How? By going over there and asking him?
- No, but I need to find some...
- Stop.
Your dad has nothing to do with who you are.
So, please just... don't do anything else till Annalise is back.
You're right.
Of course I am.
We kissed... once... but it's never gonna happen again.
And I think we've got way more pressing issues than who both of us are screwing.
- You're screwing him, too?
- No. God!
Fine. You want to know what we were talking about?
Our crappy fathers.
What are you talking about?
You know who my dad is.
Yeah.
Who the hell's the puppy's?
- You don't know?
- Just tell me.
Wallace Mahoney.
He's some rich guy Annalise did a case for in Ohio.
Why don't you know this?
You know how she likes her secrets.
Mama?
Oh!
Mama, you here?
What's wrong?
She left the stove on.
What?
What did I do now?
Disappeared from your own party.
Mama's party. And you know why I left.
She's happier with him around, Anna Mae.
- And when he leaves again?
- Let's see if that happens.
Oh, no. It's gonna happen.
I, for one, am happy that Mama isn't spending every night alone in this house.
He's been sleeping here?
You try being an old lady living alone...
I live alone. It's not that bad.
And you like it like that?
- Do you?
- Excuse me?
Dating these days, or is your job still keeping you warm at night?
Which job?
The one at the hospital or the one taking care of our mother?
Anna Mae?
Anna Mae, I need you in here.
Gentleman caller say he come to see you.
Hey.
Lord, have mercy.
Oh, Father, forgive me.
Mama.
He get your juices going, girl?
Mmm.
What you say, what you say?
God didn't miss a beat on that.
So, they haven't issued a warrant?
Not yet.
- So I'm fine.
- Right.
I came down here for no reason.
You're Annalise Keating.
Nothing can touch you.
- Is that what you want me to say?
- What do you want me to do?
Right now, come home.
Deal with this head-on.
- I can't.
- Why not?
'Cause I just got here. How is that gonna look to my family?
I think they'd rather you were out of jail.
Shhhhh!
This ain't normal, Annalise.
Running away, not answering my calls.
- I lost my phone.
- Then call your voice-mail.
I ran away because I was attacked, and now you're coming here telling me I'm about to be arrested.
Tell me, in what world do
I not deserve to run away?!
Oh.
Y'all hungry? Got the food all laid out.
Nate needs to get home, Mama.
Oh, Anna Mae, this man traveled all day long to come here and see you.
It's fine, ma'am. I should get going.
Now, Nathaniel, you just being rude.
You come to somebody's house and not be fed?
Come on, now.
- Okay. All right.
- We ain't gonna hurt you.
We're just gonna feed you.
I did it.
Smart man.
She'll never know it was you.
Right.
It was... nice to meet you.
Don't worry. We'll see each other again.
What are you doing here?
Uh, Oliver's gone rogue.
He's hacking the po-po for A.K.'s warrant.
Oh. Good.
Could've told me that downstairs.
Yeah, I-I know.
I just thought maybe we should talk about... you know.
There's nothing to talk about.
Right. Yeah, yeah. We'll just pretend like it never happened.
- Because it didn't.
- Exactly.
'Cause, I mean, if, like, Bonnie found out...
She won't, and neither will Caleb, who hopefully isn't dead right now.
Yeah, I do just... I want to say this.
Um...
It was bad morally. I feel that.
I just don't want you to think that I didn't... enjoy it.
Because I did...  uh, thoroughly.
And you're... you're something.
Oh, my God. We're gonna do this again, aren't we?
Yes, please.
Stop, stop.
Oh, God.
We're not these people.
You put your foot in this, Ophelia.
Much appreciated, Big Daddy.
Nate, how did you two meet?
- Work.
- Really?
How does that go?
I mean, you two on opposite sides...
Let Nate eat his food.
Well, he doesn't seem to mind answering a few questions, do you, Nate?
I learned to defer to Annalise on matters concerning Annalise, ma'am.
Well, this is my table, so you can defer to me.
- Are you married?
- No.
- Divorced?
- He's a widower.
- Mm.
- Oh.
Sorry to hear that.
- Got any kids?
- Mama, please.
I'm curious.
Handsome man like Nathaniel...
I wouldn't be surprised if the women come knocking down his door to have them babies.
Well, I won't say it doesn't happen, ma'am.
Got a sense of humor, too.
I'm in. I found
Annalise's arrest warrant.
It's already done, so snapping at me now will achieve nothing.
- Most of it's redacted.
- Of course it is.
And Annalise doesn't need our help.
If she did, she would be here instead of eating barbecue somewhere sitting on the dock of the bay.
There are no bays in Tennessee.
- FUJISAW.
- What?
There are seven reasons why arrest warrants can have their information redacted.
"F" is future law enforcement action.
- "U" is...
- Unknown investigatory techniques.
But what are you getting at?
"I" is informant.
Someone could be informing on Annalise.
- A rat.
- Or you're both just making things up.
Or one of us could be the rat.
- Pass the chicken.
- You want a piece of chicken?
Nathaniel, you know these three children of mine never gave me any grandchildren?
Well, it makes sense.
Both Celestine and Anna
Mae are career women.
Who has time for kids when you're busy helping people with their lives?
What's my excuse, then?
You just haven't found the right woman.
Or man.
That's your little favorite joke. That's an old joke.
You know, Daddy, lots of women work and have kids these days.
I know.
Raising kids is a full-time job.
One I... clearly never figured out myself.
Never figured out or never tried?
Got a problem, Anna Mae?
Not with you.
You know, I think it's time we segue this dinner into a party.
Sis, you done messed up already.
Come on, now, Nathaniel.
Excuse me, Miss Ophelia.
Don't break it.
Whoo-hoo!
Maybe I should leave.
You stay right where you are.
Let him go. That's what he's best at.
Anna Mae.
Maybe this is the reason why you and that husband of yours never had any babies.
Maybe it's because you never learned to stop acting like a damn baby yourself.
You're still as selfish as ever.
Only thinking about yourself, worrying about what you want.
Hey, I'm paging my baby sister to the dance floor right now!
Come on, Annalise, what's up?
You too sedated to pop that thing?
You got to pop it!
Pop, pop!
Come on, now.
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Y'all better watch out.
She's gonna want to kill me, too.
She won't.
You don't know that.
I do.
'Cause I'm the one she'd ask to do it.
Tell me you're not gonna do anything stupid.
I won't.
Look at me and say it.
I'm not gonna do anything stupid.
Oh, don't be so mad anymore.
Your daddy just left.
I know.
What's the matter with you?
Did you have that much to drink?
I had a baby, mama.
He died.
Help! He won't stop chasing me!
What are you two doing?
Get out of Mama Ophelia's kitchen, or you're going home, and that is without dessert.
No, Mommy!
- Listen...
- You promised!
Mommy does not have time for immature children tonight.
Now, listen, show Auntie Anna
Mae that you better than that.
You all right?
Yeah.
You said you wanted to know me.
I had a good time.
Mm-hmm.
Just wait till you meet my family.
Were you planning on keeping the baby a secret forever?
I would've told you.
- When?
- When it lived.
But that didn't happen, did it?
It's why your life is just upside down.
You've been dragging this baby's shadow around with you.
It's what got Sam murdered, you shot...
I wanted to get shot.
What are you saying?
Don't you ever feel like it's all too hard?
Anna Mae.
The reason why you feel it's so hard is because you're trying to do it all alone.
I need to sleep.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
Wallace Mahoney.
He's some rich guy Annalise did a case for in Ohio.
Just tell the agent that Rose told you during the interview that she was threatened by the Mahoney family.
That's why she was willing to lie on the stand.
Eve, please.
Now, I'd do it myself, but I'd get disbarred.
Or worse.
These people are dangerous, especially if what you're telling me is true, so stop it.
What happened to that boy is sad, but sad things happen to all of us.
Fine. I'll do it myself.
No, Annalise!
Take care of it.
- This is ridiculous.
- Stop pacing!
- What else am I supposed to do?
- We can't do this on our own.
All right, so, Annalise's arrest warrant was issued at 7:30 p.m. on a Tuesday, so if we just scan all the police lobby footage the days before that, see if we recognize the rat.
When we move to California, I'm gonna put you in rehab for hacking.
- Wait, go back.
- Did you see something?
I swear I saw A.D.A. Denver.
Reveal thyself, traitor!
- Yeah, there he is!
- Okay, now go slow.
Oh, my God.
Is that...
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.
Holy schnikeys.
- No freakin' way.
- Frank?
What?
We found the rat.
Anna Mae. Anna Mae.
Wake up.
- What's wrong?
- Get up.
Get up.
It's the middle of the night.
I know it is. Get up now... please.
Come on.
What are we doing, Mama?
Shh.
Come.
This is... for you to write a letter for your baby to take to his homegoing.
Mnh-mnh.
All right, I'll do it. What's his name?
No.
What now?
His name was Sam.
Since when does anyone knock?
It's me, Anna Mae.
I found this in my pocket this morning.
Please.
Mom told you to give it to me.
She's just being your mother.
Well, she needs to stop doing that.
I'm so sorry I hurt you, Anna Mae.
Please know that.
Why are you back here?
- I love her.
- Mnh.
You're not here for her.
You're here for you.
'Course I am.
Just like you.
I lost myself out there.
That's what all that running did to me.
But your mama... she reminds me of who I am.
I think you of all people should understand how that feels.
Don't you get sick of it?
Coming back here, apologizing, just to leave again?
Go away.
Hey, it's Frank. Just got to the office.
Where the hell are you?
Annalise, it's Bonnie.
Laurel just told us what she said. Please come home.
I'm sorry I told you, and if that's why you left, please don't blame anyone else.
It's Wes. I just need to run something...
Annalise, hey. Call me as soon as you get this.
Oliver's gonna ask you for a job. I know it, so...
Annalise, A.D.A. Denver... again.
I'm giving you the courtesy to show up on your own, but I'm sending in the Tennessee P.D. if you're not at the station by 5:00 p.m. today.
What?
Oh, thank God you picked up.
I got her.
Michaela, I'm hanging up right now if you don't tell me what you need.
It's about your arrest warrant.
There's an informant who's giving evidence against you, and we know who it is.
- Who?
- Caleb.
He was never missing.
He was just ratting out to the police for who knows how long... maybe since the beginning.
And I'm just so mad at myself for not figuring it out.
I should've known there'd be something wrong with him, but I...
Michaela, relax.
I know how to handle this.
What's going on?
I hate myself for this, but...
I need your help now.
You wait too long to come back, there could be no mama here to nurse you back to health.
Subtle, Mama.
Come here.
No lawyer?
I still don't know my charges.
As of now, obstruction of justice and hindering a prosecution in the Hapstall case.
You manipulated Caleb Hapstall into forcing his sister's confession.
Ordered one of your interns to initiate a sexual relationship with him.
And then you demanded he pay you six figures so there would be no record of the two of you working together.
- This is funny to you?
- No.
What's funny is that your whole case against me relies on the word of a sociopathic liar.
Excuse me?
Caleb Hapstall is a serial killer.
Call 911.
There's someone in Wes' apartment!
Unh!
Stop fighting me!
Caleb killed my mother!
Helena Hapstall.
He killed her.
I have proof.
Please. Believe me.
I'm innocent.
Caleb went running that night.
We all know that.
What we didn't know is that he was wearing a fitness tracker.
I didn't know you went out.
Just a run to de-stress.
It records your heart rate, mileage, location.
I hacked into Caleb's, and it's all there.
Proof that he was at the exact...
... location Helena
Hapstall's body was found.
- This doesn't prove anything.
- No?
How about this?
- Who are you?
- Friend of a friend.
Hello?
You need to tell them, Catherine.
He's your brother, you love him, but... look at where you are and where he is.
Please. Just tell them what you told me.
Catherine Hapstall will testify in court to everything in this statement... that on the night her parents were murdered, she went to Caleb's room.
Why'd you go into his room?
'Cause that's what we did every night... slept together.
Not... sex, but... we'd do other things.
Cuddle.
Kiss.
But when I got to his room that night... he wasn't there.
Why are you just admitting this now?
Because I'm in love with him.
She was so blinded by love that she didn't tell anyone that Caleb left his room that night to go torture and shoot his parents.
Philip's DNA was found at the crime scene.
'Cause Caleb likely planted it there... just like he planted the gun in his sister's studio... all to make sure that he was the sole Hapstall child, free to inherit Mommy and Daddy's money.
This is such a reach, Annalise.
No.
What's a reach is you prosecuting me... a respected, powerful, law-abiding attorney who just got shot on the job.
But instead, you can nail a sociopath who fooled the entire
Philadelphia justice system... until you came along and solved the case all by yourself.
No deal.
We know who the killer is here.
You mean Philip Jessup?
He's here, if you want to ask him anything.
After a two-week manhunt, police have located alleged murder suspect Philip Jessup right here in Philadelphia.
Sources say Jessup contacted police himself, claiming he had new information about the Hapstall murders, some of which has now led police to again look at Caleb Hapstall as the prime suspect in this case.
Are we supposed to believe any of this?
Haven't you learned not to ask that question by now?
True or not, she's brilliant.
... district attorney's office dropped all charges
- against Hapstall...
- You okay?
No.
- Everyone out.
- What?
Annalise ran away to escape all of your annoying faces.
Do you think she's gonna want to see you the minute she gets back?
Leave.
... conducting a multi-state search for his location.
You too.
I've got this.
And sources say Catherine Hapstall has been speaking privately with detectives about her brother's involvement in both murders, even withdrawing the alibi she gave her brother the night her parents were murdered.
And Caleb Hapstall's location is not being disclosed at this moment, the likelihood being he's already in police custody.
We have reporters standing by at the police station, and we will bring you the latest information as it becomes available.
Shirley, hi. This is, uh, Connor Walsh.
Yeah, I'm calling because I just received my acceptance e-mail.
Yeah, it is very, very exciting, but...
I'm actually calling to say that I won't be attending.
It's a long story.
I have an idea.
Uh, take me off all future mailings, too. Bye.
- You don't want to move.
- I do.
So... let's have sex, and whoever arrives first gets to decide once and for all.
That's not fair. You got a head start.
Well, take off your shorts and I'll make sure that we start even.
Hi.
Frank was just doing what he was told.
Is he dead?
I'm so, so sorry.
Take him!
Sam.
How is she?
She's, uh... she's good.
But we, uh... we lost the baby.
They think the accident caused it.
They rushed her into the O.R. and tried to deliver him as fast as possible, but, uh... it was too late.
It's my fault.
No, it was... it was a car accident.
It wasn't.
It was me. I did this.
Frank...
They told me they just wanted to get a mistrial.
They said they... they could say someone else put the bug in there, but they must've known where she was going.
You're lying.
Tell me you're lying, Frank.
I'm so sorry.
She can never know.
No. I need to tell her.
That's not happening.
She needs to know what they did!
No, what you did.
What you did!
You think about how she'll feel knowing it could've been prevented.
She won't forgive herself.
You know that.
Please. Let me tell her.
No.
I lost my son.
I can't lose her, too.
You tell her... and I'll ruin you.
You owe me.
He held it over him... all this time.
Why do you keep doing it?
Believing what men tell you.
It was Sam.
It was the both of them.
But I thought I did it.
I thought I killed him. I...
They let me believe that.
I...
Where is he?
Home.
Annalise.
He needs to go.
Frank?
Hello?
Frank?
Frank?
I want to be there, but tell me how we explain that to anyone.
N... No.
The minute I show up, gossip starts, and then this... w-what we've been doing, that's all anyone is gonna talk about.
- Hold on a second.
- Can I help you?
What?
I think I'm your son.
Why would you think that?
Annalise Keating...

# S03
## S03E1

Previously on "How To
Get Away With Murder"...
Stanford. I want you to come with me.
This is, uh, Connor Walsh.
I'm calling to say that
I won't be attending.
- I killed Lila.
- You did it for Sam.
She can't know.
Frank was just doing what he was told.
You want to change your life, or are you happy just to stay
Annalise Keating's bitch?
I'm sorry.
I did this to him. I did it.
Sam.
It was me. I did this.
She won't forgive herself.
She can never know.
- It was Sam.
- It was the both of them.
- Where is he?
- Annalise.
He needs to go.
Hello? Frank?
- My father... he's dead.
- He's very much alive, and his name is Wallace Mahoney.
- I think I'm your son.
- Why would you think that?
Annalise Keating...
A little respect, please!
I was just... asking for directions.
I don't live here. I was a little lost.
He just stepped out of the office, so I stopped him.
He seemed angry...
Because you interrupted a phone call he was on?
Yeah.
And the person on the other end, when we speak with them, they'll verify you were just asking for directions?
'Course.
- Thanks for...
- Quiet.
Not here.
Tell me exactly what he said.
- He was on the phone...
- Not your father.
Frank.
Want to go finally meet your dad?
That's his office.
You sure?
He's your friggin' father.
You have a right to meet him.
Yeah, but Annalise made me promise...
It was her idea.
She knows you, how nosy you are.
But... if you want to call her, make sure she's down with this...
Don't.
You're just gonna say hi. That's all.
And I'm here for backup in case things get out of hand.
Tell me how we explain that to anyone.
No, the minute I show up, gossip starts, and then this...
What... What we've been doing, that's all anyone is gonna talk about.
Hold on a second.
- Can I help you?
- I think I'm your son.
Why would you think that?
Annalise Keating...
I would've run, but the driver was parked right there.
And I looked for Frank, but his car was gone.
I'm so sorry, Wes.
- For what?
- Frank.
He did this for me.
You asked him to shoot my father?
- No.
- Then how is this for you?
Listen to me, okay? Just listen.
Your father hurt me, too.
In the worst way.
I didn't know, because Frank hid it from me for years.
Tonight was his way of making things right.
- How does this make anything right?
- It doesn't.
He took me there on purpose, told me it was your idea.
Because he's using you against me.
And he knows that I can hurt him.
But I can't now, can I?
Not when he could go to the police with the truth...
That you're actually
Wallace Mahoney's son.
Get out.
Your father's dead. Frank did that.
And neither of these men are...
Are worth losing ourselves over.
They're gone for good, and we need to let them go.
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey.
When did you get back in town?
A week ago... When I texted you.
Right. Sorry.
I went with Maggie up to her parents' cabin.
There wasn't really reception.
You met Maggie's parents already?
No, it was just the two of us.
Nice!
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
First day. Can't be late.
Homies, over here.
Mr. C8, Miss A8. It's your new seats.
I got here early to make sure we weren't sat next to some weenball.
He doesn't realize that's him.
Oh, please tell me I'm in the back somewhere.
I need to catch up on my sleep.
No... B4. But the good news is, I'm right behind you.
Well, of course you're all here.
Why wouldn't we be here?
Well, we've all seen the rankings.
You think there's any way you'd all be in this class if Keating wasn't teaching it?
- Excuse me?
- That's aggressive.
Sers, bro, you want to step to us like that and class hasn't even begun yet?
Actually, I'm just trying to step to my seat.
Congratulations.
You've each been hand-chosen to take part in my very first criminal law legal clinic.
In here, you're not just students, but actual practicing lawyers, responsible for your own cases and clients.
You finally get to be me.

Someone is clearly upset I didn't pick them for this class.
This clinic is pro bono.
We only represent people who can't afford their own lawyers.
You will each compete to become first chair.
Some of you will end up defending several clients, while the lamer of you will never step foot in front of a judge.
Now, who will that be?
Let's start.
Karim Assaf... A refugee from Iraq who came here 10 years ago with his two children.
Cut to a year ago.
Karim is driving his two children to school.
The police stop him and find over 2 ounces of marijuana.
Karim pleads guilty to possession with the intent to distribute and serves 12 months, and now he faces additional legal trouble.
What could that be...
Ms. Leibowitz?
An intent to distribute would make him subject to deportation.
Well, Karim has a green card.
Shouldn't that allow him to stay in the U.S.?
- Mr. Montgomery.
- Um, no.
The court doesn't look at deportation as an additional form of punishment.
What Supreme Court decision is Mr. Montgomery referencing?
Uh, Ms. Pratt.
- I don't know.
- Surprise, surprise.
Care to back up that smack talk, Mr. Drake?
The Supreme Court case Fong
Yue Ting v. United States, decided 1893.
Justice Horace Gray delivered the plurality opinion.
Show-off.
All right, tomorrow, each of you will get a chance to present a defense that keeps Karim in this country.
Now, I'll pick two of you for first and second chair.
But be careful.
Winning means that you carry the fate of this entire family in your hands.
And you wonder why people think I favor you?
Wait. You aren't at all concerned?
About what?
- The flier.
- It's a piece of paper.
- That says "killer" on it.
- I've been called worse.
Everything's fine. The police have moved on.
Nothing bad's happened all summer...
- Like that means anything.
- It means we're safe.
And you want to know why?
We're good people now.
Say it to yourself until you believe it.
Ray Fonseca fired his lawyer.
They're holding him on extortion and bribery.
He's a gang leader, Bonnie.
- A gang leader with a lot of money.
- Stop it.
This is hard enough without you dangling carrots in my face.
Hi.
Hi.
I just came to say that I'm going to Mexico for the summer.
I thought your father couldn't go back to Mexico.
He can't. I'm visiting my mom.
Mm.
And Frank?
Will he be there, too?
He left me, too, you know.
Do I know?
You were the one I called when
I realized he was missing.
You mean when his bitch-ass ran away.
Which I knew nothing about.
And is that what you honestly think of me...
That I'd be okay with what he did to Wes?
Quiet!
I've been on your side the entire time, helping you every time you asked me, so I don't deserve this.
Be angry at Frank.
Just do not be angry at me.
There's no gray area here, Laurel.
It's him or it's me.
He's dead to me.
Good.
Bring me back some tequila.
My body's sick of vodka.
It's Frank. Leave a message.
Your mailbox isn't full, so I know that means you're checking your messages and not dead somewhere.
I just wanted to say...
I hate you.
Do you mind if we record this so that Professor Keating can monitor what we say?
Your daughter Faiza believes you were the victim of profiling.
- That's not true.
- Are you sure?
'Cause if we can convince the judge there was discrimination in your case...
I refuse to play that card.
- Even if it makes a convincing story?
- Turn off the recording.
We need to use every advantage we have...
Turn it off, and I'll explain.
Our client already pled guilty. We all know that.
So I suggest we have Karim say just three simple words to the judge... "I am sorry."
Any excuse or denial will only serve to hurt him, whereas remorse will show that he has learned his lesson and is ready to return to society as a fully rehabilitated citizen.
Well done, Mr. Drake.
That's his big idea?
An apology? Weenball.
Mr. Millstone.
Uh...
Well, because it's immigration court and there's no jury, uh, my idea is to target the personality of the judge.
And provide a reason why Karim would purchase that much marijuana.
- For example...
- We could apply for asylum, argue that we don't know the new dangers that he could face back in Iraq... where he could work as an informant to the FBI, trading information on radical members of his community, which would then allow us to revisit...
The judge's office, and while her clerk wasn't exactly forthcoming,
I did find out that she's a grandmother.
We could hit home the idea that his life is more valuable here than in Iraq, thereby persuading the judge to order...
A stay of removal is the best thing for all parties involved.
This will allow us time to delay and prove...
Smoking marijuana helps with symptoms of PTSD, so even though Karim's test came back negative,
- We could argue...
- An expungement or...
Appeal to the judge's maternal instincts.
And while this wouldn't be helpful in most cases, with immigration court, the decisions are often left to the judge's discretion...
Professor Keating!
Excuse me. I'm in the middle of...
The pot wasn't Karim's.
It was his daughter's.
He didn't know she was dealing until the cop found the drugs, so then he said they were his in order to protect her.
What do you suggest we do with that information?
We could go to the original prosecutor and explain that he was just being a good father.
So they deport his daughter instead?
No, she hasn't been in
Iraq since she was 6.
Do you think our immigration courts really care?
- You're out, Ms. Castillo.
- What?
Mr. Gibbins, you're last up.
- I didn't finish.
- You're out, too. Impress me.
Research shows hearing from family and friends is the most effective tactic to evade deportation.
Knowing this, I talked to about a dozen of Karim's friends, neighbors, even his imam at the mosque, and they all agreed to testify as character witnesses.
Finally... a practical strategy we can use in court.
Mr. Gibbins, you're first chair.
Mr. Drake, you're his second.
The rest of you, do better.
Professor Keating?
I didn't pick you because your mom was an immigrant.
I know.
I just wanted to talk to you about my opening statement.
I have a draft here.
You wrote an opening for a case you hadn't been assigned to yet?
I had a good feeling.
Why are you always stalking me?
Well, at least they chose a good photo.
You want to get in?
Sure.
Oh! Feels good.
Right?
You haven't returned my calls.
I'm just trying to disconnect.
Be happy or something.
I get that.
Look...
I think Oliver's going to ask you for a job.
I need you to promise me that you'll say no.
I haven't asked for much...
I mean, anything, really...
Oliver's never coming to work for me.
You swear?
Because he'll, uh, he'll find things out.
We'd ruin him.
Yeah, exactly.
He'd become the new Asher.
I won't let that happen.
You have my word.
I could encrypt the firm's files, update your firewalls.
That way, no one like me could hack you.
Because I totally could.
Not that I have. I haven't.
Uh... so don't worry, but... you're very vulnerable.
Here's my proposal.
Also, the thing that I really wanted to tell you is...
I admire you.
And I know what other people say about you, but...
What do they say?
No, not about you specifically, but, um... defense attorneys.
I think it's so unfair.
Because what I see you do is help people who can't help themselves.
I want to be a part of that.
I'm not hiring anyone right now.
I deleted Connor's Stanford acceptance.
I knew they might call, too, or send a follow-up e-mail, so I hacked their system and had those re-routed to me.
- He doesn't know.
- But you're telling me?
I know what you do here.
That it's not always... good.
So I just wanted to be very clear with you.
I can be bad, too.
Who wants another mojito?
- Oh, keep 'em comin'.
- Yas, queen!
None for me.
Ooh, because you're pregnant with Frank's baby?
No, because I am trying to be a good student.
Boring!
I...didn't know we were having a party.
Hey, Oli!
Where were you?
Oh, I went for a walk in the park.
Hashtag unemployment.
Dawg, that makes it sound like you were cruising for the D.
So, how was everybody's summer?
Any new significant others, besides Wes' little lady?
Not me.
Ask Laurel. She's single again.
You still haven't heard from Frank?
- Nope.
- I bet he's living in South America, just off the fat of the land, whacking bush.
God, I miss that beard.
I don't.
I should go.
Going to get it in with Meggy Weggy?
That's not her actual name, right?
It's Megan or Margaret.
I'm gonna go work on Karim's case.
Who chooses to call themselves Meggy?
Am I hitting the spot?
Oh, God, yes.
Someone put up a flier of me on campus.
It said "killer."
Don't worry.
It's probably just some student whose feelings I hurt.
You tell the new president?
So she has reason to be up my ass again?
No.
It's harassment, Annalise.
I knew I shouldn't have told you.
All I'm saying is, whoever did this could be unstable.
I'm unstable.
Maybe they need to be protected from me.
Your turn.
I said roll over.
Mmm.
Oh, my God, that feels good.
- Sorry to barge in.
- What now?
Well, you know how I'm not really talking to my mom?
Uh, well, that means I'm not getting any support from her, uh, financially, and with next year's tuition due...
I need a loan, basically.
You think I'm joking?
No. I think you're serious.
Please, Annalise, I'm really struggling here.
Yeah, because your white ass has struggled a day in its life.
Okay, my white ass is only in this position because of you.
Excuse me?
My dad was perfectly happy to pay my way, but now he's dead because
I chose you over him.
Well, that's your version of the truth, not mine.
You need some money? Get a job, like everyone else.
Jerk.
I should've looked into
Karim's public defender, argued ineffective assistance of counsel.
My perfect breasts are in your face, and you want to talk about the case?
Right. Stay put. We got options.
Ooh.
Ooh.
The Extender... not that I need it.
Are those from the bowl in the hallway?
Just one of the perks of the new crib.
Asher! Are you in there?
Ignore her.
Sorry. I'm on duty.
- Miladies.
- Show him.
Eh! If it's a rash, you go to the infirmary for that.
Chad texted her back, but she doesn't know what it means.
It means he's over me, right?
Look, we're gonna have to have a conversation later about... having conversations.
But now I need you to peer-process this.
Hey, what are you doing? Get naked!
I'm a grown-ass woman.
I can't be having sex in dorm rooms.
Uh, of course you can.
Otherwise, you're just discriminating against me
'cause I'm poor now.
Welcome to America.
Don't worry. You can't mess this up.
Because there's no way to win.
The defense only wins 3% of the cases in this court, which means you literally have nothing to lose.
Just try to enjoy it.
Karim Assaf is a good man...
A dedicated father, a kind neighbor.
He steps up when help is needed...
- This is so corny.
- Poor Karim.
Poor Karim's children.
He is a leader in his community.
But you don't have to take my word for it.
Take theirs.
The 15 people who've come to attest to the upstanding character of my client.
Okay, he's kind of killing it.
Each person you see here has their own story of his selflessness, generosity, good citizenship, and, above all, his integrity.
- She's so predictable.
- What?
I know how to win.
I was thinking about the drug charge, how if we could prove
Karim's public defender provided ineffective assistance of counsel...
Hey, that was my idea.
Except you didn't go to the public defender to record him saying this.
Did you or did you not tell your client that pleading guilty would cost him his green card?
I'm saying I don't know!
He doesn't remember.
But Padilla v. Kentucky says defense attorneys must advise clients about risks of deportation when pleading guilty.
- Mr. Drake, you're out.
- What?!
Ms. Pratt just turned this case on its head.
Bonnie, you take my place. Mr. Walsh, with me.
You two, stall.
I'd like to call the defense's first witness to the stand...
Mr. Nasim Darwish, our client's imam at his mosque.
You just give the name, young lady... no biography.
Sorry.
Did you or did you not tell your client that pleading guilty would cost him his green card?
I'm saying I don't know!
Sign the motion to vacate,
I'll be out of your hair.
He said, "I don't know."
That doesn't mean he didn't tell your client.
Doesn't mean he did, either.
I need my boss to sign off on it.
And let's face it, Annalise...
He's not about to help you after all the crap you put us through this year.
And what does Mr. Assaf do at your hardware store?
He's our stockroom manager.
And just what does that job entail?
Uh... taking care of the stockroom.
The defense calls Myriam
Mahmoud-Faizan to the stand.
- Carol Lunn.
- Jodie Mayer.
- Khalid El Baur.
- Ashley Chang.
- Owen Marconi.
- Katrina Barberi.
- Makram Azia. Faraj Shah.
- Gina Brown. Steven Mason.
- Jamal Ibrahim.
- This is what we'll do.
Drop the original charge to possession only.
You get your guilty plea, but it's a misdemeanor now.
That way, my client has a chance of remaining with his family.
Everyone wins.
What about the daughter?
I can make her cry on the stand.
Or she'll end up telling the truth.
Ms. Winterbottom, either call your next witness or I'm making my decision.
We'd like to call Faiza
Assaf, Your Honor.
I told Annalise she can't testify.
It'll buy us time.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Your Honor, I have a new plea to present to the court.
Approach.
This reduces Mr. Assaf's felony to a misdemeanor, which makes him eligible to remain in the country.
I move for his immediate release.
Your Honor, Mr. Assaf pled guilty to this charge months ago.
Let's take a recess, and
I'll give my decision after.
Mr. Walsh.
- We're gonna win this thing, right?
- Who the hell knows?
We need to talk about your boyfriend.
- Why?
- I'm gonna hire him.
No.
You looked me in the eye and promised me...
Do you know he deleted your Stanford acceptance?
And he has the capacity to hack my files... God forbid.
Point is, he's farther down the rabbit hole than we thought.
I'll hire him to work in the clinic, we'll bury him in busywork.
No more sticking his nose where it doesn't belong.
Sound good?
They're not gonna file anything.
Get up.
Michaela.
I know now why you're not supposed to meet your heroes.
You're gonna pick a fight after
I saved your drunk ass from jail?
I was drunk. I am totally sober now.
Say what you need to say.
No.
This is a child's behavior.
You're better than this.
Oh, my God! Was that a compliment?
You're very smart and pretty.
Is that what you want to hear?
- Get in the car!
- God!
You can't just expect us to be like you!
I am trying... I am...
But the idea that we're just supposed to go back to being normal, become stupid lawyers...
Well, I'm not normal anymore!
You were never normal!
You just didn't know it until now.
God, you're such a bitch.
You were strong enough to run away from a bad family, so you're strong enough to get through this.
That's why I never worried about you.
Next time you want to drink yourself silly, call me.
I have a full liquor cabinet, and I won't let you drive home drunk.
Okay?
Now let's go.
We look like we're working the corner at this point.
We are back on the record in the deportation proceeding of Karim Assaf.
Mr. Assaf, it troubles me deeply that you pled guilty to a distribution charge you're now saying you did not commit.
Can you tell me why you did this?
I hoped it would minimize the chances of me getting deported.
So you lied under oath?
Your Honor, I think you should stick to the law.
Yes. And I am sorry for that.
Mr. Assaf, this admission calls into question your integrity, as well as everything positive that was said about you in this courtroom today.
I've therefore come to the conclusion that, despite the excessive community support shown here...
I'm going to order your deportation.
Objection! The prior felony has been vacated!
- Sit down.
- Judge, there's no legal obligation!
- Enough!
- This is up to your discretion!
- Just let me tell them the truth!
- Stop it!
But nothing about this makes sense!
It's such a waste.
Justice is the exception.
You should know that by now.
Take the anger that you're feeling and put it into your next case.
Hey.
So... you're gonna be mad, but
Annalise offered me a job, and I want to take it, so...
Yeah, she told me. Um...
I think it's a great idea.
You do?
Yeah. I do.
She also told me about Stanford.
Is it true?
All right, uh... here's the thing.
The fact that you felt that you had to do that,
I mean, that tells me that, you know,
I just... I wasn't listening when you said that you didn't want to move.
I was just putting my feelings before yours.
And I'm sorry for that.
You're sorry?
Yeah.
This...
This isn't okay.
You get to be angry.
- But I'm not.
- Well, you should be.
- Says who?
- Anybody who hears this story!
I stole an amazing opportunity from you...
Yeah, and... And I'm forgiving you.
Which isn't okay! You should be pissed off.
And... And yelling.
But the fact that you're not is...
Maybe we're just both messed up, or the sex is so good that we can't see it, but this is not what a healthy relationship looks like.
We're the best relationship that I know.
Well, then, that's really sad.
How is that sad? I love you, Oliver.
Wow. Seriously?
That's your response to finding out I lied to you?
- Everyone lies in relationships.
- No. No.
I don't.
Or, at least, I don't want to be someone who does.
So...
"So"?
"So" what?
I love you.
I love you so much.
Okay, now you're scaring me.
Just... Hey, let me say this.
You've been so good to me.
Like, you stayed with me even when most guys would've run, but... you didn't even bat an eye.
You just loved me.
And you loved me back.
I know, but I'm different now than when we first met.
- How is that my fault?
- It's not your fault.
I just don't know who I am anymore.
We all go through that...
Yeah, but I think it would be better for me if I went through it alone.
So, what?
You're saying that you, uh...
Do you want to take a break or something?
I think we should break up.
Professor Keating. I'm so sorry to make you wait.
You're the new president.
Everyone wants a piece of you.
Congratulations, by the way.
Thank you. Let's see how long I last.
Please, have a seat.
Well, first... let me say I'm an admirer.
You've broken many a glass ceiling on this campus.
That's nice but not true.
Take the compliment.
Thank you.
You're wondering why you're here.
I am.
We've decided to transition you into a research position this year and have a new professor teach
Introduction to Criminal Law.
I wanted you to hear it directly from me, as I know how important that class is to you.
We simply think it's the best decision for you and the university.
Because you know what's best for me?
I'm on your side, Annalise.
There's not that many of us...
- Then fire me for real.
- Nobody wants that.
Then what do you want?
Because it seems to me you're punishing one of your most esteemed professors due to tragedies in her personal life.
Actually... it's precisely because of your performance as a professor that we've made this decision.
The students who work at your firm have historically graduated at the top of their class.
The five from this year, however, all rank in the bottom 10%.
- How about a pro bono clinic?
- Annalise...
My reputation's a concern for you. That's clear.
So why not give me a chance to repair it?
I'll circle back with the others, let you know what they think.
You see this?
Oh.
Good thing it's not a real newspaper.
The president contact you yet?
I'm ignoring her calls.
You think it's Frank putting them up?
No.
Because he's dead?
I'd understand.
He could destroy us all if he wanted.
Like I don't know that.
It's all Sam's fault.
He's the one who made me hire Frank.
Now look.
I'm no killer, Bonnie.
And God forbid I let
Frank make me into one.
Bastard's not worth it.
Sorry. I... thought you were Meggy.
You decorated?
- Yeah.
- Meggy's idea?
She's really nice.
- Nicer than me, you mean.
- I didn't say that.
Why are you being such a jerk?
Fine.
- I'll go.
- Laurel, I...
You won't even respond to my texts!
I'm sorry.
I don't want you to be sorry.
I just want you to talk to me.
I want that, too.
Well, then what's wrong?
When I look at you... all I see is Frank.
And I need to forget what he did.
I will never forgive him for what he did to you.
- You know that, right?
- Of course.
And I... I wish I didn't... equate you with him.
I just...
Uh...
Meggy's on her way.
I should go.
- Hi.
- Hi!
I'm Laurel. I'm Wes' friend.
I was just here to drop off an outline...
Wait. Like, the Laurel?
Wes talks about you all the time.
- He does?
- Yes.
And no handshakes. I'm a hugger.
Come here.
Hey.
- What is it?
- I found him.
So... do or die.
What do you want to do?
You there?
Annalise?
Annalise?
Hang up the phone!
I said hang up!
You got a creaky stair.
I can fix it if you want.
Hey.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I live here! Please!
Ma'am! Just calm down!
Who is it?!
A little respect, please!
- Calm down!
- Who is it? Tell me!
Tell me!
Hey!
- Get her!
- Hey! Ma'am!
Ma'am, let me just see.
Ma'am, I'm not authorized to let you...
No, I know that. I live here.
No!
No!
No!!
No!!
No!
No!!

## S03E2

Previously on "How To
Get Away With Murder"...
Stanford. I want you to come with me.
This is, uh, Connor Walsh.
I'm calling to say that
I won't be attending.
- I killed Lila.
- You did it for Sam.
She can't know.
Frank was just doing what he was told.
You want to change your life, or are you happy just to stay
Annalise Keating's bitch?
I'm sorry.
I did this to him. I did it.
Sam.
It was me. I did this.
She won't forgive herself.
She can never know.
- It was Sam.
- It was the both of them.
- Where is he?
- Annalise.
He needs to go.
Hello? Frank?
- My father... he's dead.
- He's very much alive, and his name is Wallace Mahoney.
- I think I'm your son.
- Why would you think that?
Annalise Keating...
A little respect, please!
I was just... asking for directions.
I don't live here. I was a little lost.
He just stepped out of the office, so I stopped him.
He seemed angry...
Because you interrupted a phone call he was on?
Yeah.
And the person on the other end, when we speak with them, they'll verify you were just asking for directions?
'Course.
- Thanks for...
- Quiet.
Not here.
Tell me exactly what he said.
- He was on the phone...
- Not your father.
Frank.
Want to go finally meet your dad?
That's his office.
You sure?
He's your friggin' father.
You have a right to meet him.
Yeah, but Annalise made me promise...
It was her idea.
She knows you, how nosy you are.
But... if you want to call her, make sure she's down with this...
Don't.
You're just gonna say hi. That's all.
And I'm here for backup in case things get out of hand.
Tell me how we explain that to anyone.
No, the minute I show up, gossip starts, and then this...
What... What we've been doing, that's all anyone is gonna talk about.
Hold on a second.
- Can I help you?
- I think I'm your son.
Why would you think that?
Annalise Keating...
I would've run, but the driver was parked right there.
And I looked for Frank, but his car was gone.
I'm so sorry, Wes.
- For what?
- Frank.
He did this for me.
You asked him to shoot my father?
- No.
- Then how is this for you?
Listen to me, okay? Just listen.
Your father hurt me, too.
In the worst way.
I didn't know, because Frank hid it from me for years.
Tonight was his way of making things right.
- How does this make anything right?
- It doesn't.
He took me there on purpose, told me it was your idea.
Because he's using you against me.
And he knows that I can hurt him.
But I can't now, can I?
Not when he could go to the police with the truth...
That you're actually
Wallace Mahoney's son.
Get out.
Your father's dead. Frank did that.
And neither of these men are...
Are worth losing ourselves over.
They're gone for good, and we need to let them go.
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey.
When did you get back in town?
A week ago... When I texted you.
Right. Sorry.
I went with Maggie up to her parents' cabin.
There wasn't really reception.
You met Maggie's parents already?
No, it was just the two of us.
Nice!
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
First day. Can't be late.
Homies, over here.
Mr. C8, Miss A8. It's your new seats.
I got here early to make sure we weren't sat next to some weenball.
He doesn't realize that's him.
Oh, please tell me I'm in the back somewhere.
I need to catch up on my sleep.
No... B4. But the good news is, I'm right behind you.
Well, of course you're all here.
Why wouldn't we be here?
Well, we've all seen the rankings.
You think there's any way you'd all be in this class if Keating wasn't teaching it?
- Excuse me?
- That's aggressive.
Sers, bro, you want to step to us like that and class hasn't even begun yet?
Actually, I'm just trying to step to my seat.
Congratulations.
You've each been hand-chosen to take part in my very first criminal law legal clinic.
In here, you're not just students, but actual practicing lawyers, responsible for your own cases and clients.
You finally get to be me.

Someone is clearly upset I didn't pick them for this class.
This clinic is pro bono.
We only represent people who can't afford their own lawyers.
You will each compete to become first chair.
Some of you will end up defending several clients, while the lamer of you will never step foot in front of a judge.
Now, who will that be?
Let's start.
Karim Assaf... A refugee from Iraq who came here 10 years ago with his two children.
Cut to a year ago.
Karim is driving his two children to school.
The police stop him and find over 2 ounces of marijuana.
Karim pleads guilty to possession with the intent to distribute and serves 12 months, and now he faces additional legal trouble.
What could that be...
Ms. Leibowitz?
An intent to distribute would make him subject to deportation.
Well, Karim has a green card.
Shouldn't that allow him to stay in the U.S.?
- Mr. Montgomery.
- Um, no.
The court doesn't look at deportation as an additional form of punishment.
What Supreme Court decision is Mr. Montgomery referencing?
Uh, Ms. Pratt.
- I don't know.
- Surprise, surprise.
Care to back up that smack talk, Mr. Drake?
The Supreme Court case Fong
Yue Ting v. United States, decided 1893.
Justice Horace Gray delivered the plurality opinion.
Show-off.
All right, tomorrow, each of you will get a chance to present a defense that keeps Karim in this country.
Now, I'll pick two of you for first and second chair.
But be careful.
Winning means that you carry the fate of this entire family in your hands.
And you wonder why people think I favor you?
Wait. You aren't at all concerned?
About what?
- The flier.
- It's a piece of paper.
- That says "killer" on it.
- I've been called worse.
Everything's fine. The police have moved on.
Nothing bad's happened all summer...
- Like that means anything.
- It means we're safe.
And you want to know why?
We're good people now.
Say it to yourself until you believe it.
Ray Fonseca fired his lawyer.
They're holding him on extortion and bribery.
He's a gang leader, Bonnie.
- A gang leader with a lot of money.
- Stop it.
This is hard enough without you dangling carrots in my face.
Hi.
Hi.
I just came to say that I'm going to Mexico for the summer.
I thought your father couldn't go back to Mexico.
He can't. I'm visiting my mom.
Mm.
And Frank?
Will he be there, too?
He left me, too, you know.
Do I know?
You were the one I called when
I realized he was missing.
You mean when his bitch-ass ran away.
Which I knew nothing about.
And is that what you honestly think of me...
That I'd be okay with what he did to Wes?
Quiet!
I've been on your side the entire time, helping you every time you asked me, so I don't deserve this.
Be angry at Frank.
Just do not be angry at me.
There's no gray area here, Laurel.
It's him or it's me.
He's dead to me.
Good.
Bring me back some tequila.
My body's sick of vodka.
It's Frank. Leave a message.
Your mailbox isn't full, so I know that means you're checking your messages and not dead somewhere.
I just wanted to say...
I hate you.
Do you mind if we record this so that Professor Keating can monitor what we say?
Your daughter Faiza believes you were the victim of profiling.
- That's not true.
- Are you sure?
'Cause if we can convince the judge there was discrimination in your case...
I refuse to play that card.
- Even if it makes a convincing story?
- Turn off the recording.
We need to use every advantage we have...
Turn it off, and I'll explain.
Our client already pled guilty. We all know that.
So I suggest we have Karim say just three simple words to the judge... "I am sorry."
Any excuse or denial will only serve to hurt him, whereas remorse will show that he has learned his lesson and is ready to return to society as a fully rehabilitated citizen.
Well done, Mr. Drake.
That's his big idea?
An apology? Weenball.
Mr. Millstone.
Uh...
Well, because it's immigration court and there's no jury, uh, my idea is to target the personality of the judge.
And provide a reason why Karim would purchase that much marijuana.
- For example...
- We could apply for asylum, argue that we don't know the new dangers that he could face back in Iraq... where he could work as an informant to the FBI, trading information on radical members of his community, which would then allow us to revisit...
The judge's office, and while her clerk wasn't exactly forthcoming,
I did find out that she's a grandmother.
We could hit home the idea that his life is more valuable here than in Iraq, thereby persuading the judge to order...
A stay of removal is the best thing for all parties involved.
This will allow us time to delay and prove...
Smoking marijuana helps with symptoms of PTSD, so even though Karim's test came back negative,
- We could argue...
- An expungement or...
Appeal to the judge's maternal instincts.
And while this wouldn't be helpful in most cases, with immigration court, the decisions are often left to the judge's discretion...
Professor Keating!
Excuse me. I'm in the middle of...
The pot wasn't Karim's.
It was his daughter's.
He didn't know she was dealing until the cop found the drugs, so then he said they were his in order to protect her.
What do you suggest we do with that information?
We could go to the original prosecutor and explain that he was just being a good father.
So they deport his daughter instead?
No, she hasn't been in
Iraq since she was 6.
Do you think our immigration courts really care?
- You're out, Ms. Castillo.
- What?
Mr. Gibbins, you're last up.
- I didn't finish.
- You're out, too. Impress me.
Research shows hearing from family and friends is the most effective tactic to evade deportation.
Knowing this, I talked to about a dozen of Karim's friends, neighbors, even his imam at the mosque, and they all agreed to testify as character witnesses.
Finally... a practical strategy we can use in court.
Mr. Gibbins, you're first chair.
Mr. Drake, you're his second.
The rest of you, do better.
Professor Keating?
I didn't pick you because your mom was an immigrant.
I know.
I just wanted to talk to you about my opening statement.
I have a draft here.
You wrote an opening for a case you hadn't been assigned to yet?
I had a good feeling.
Why are you always stalking me?
Well, at least they chose a good photo.
You want to get in?
Sure.
Oh! Feels good.
Right?
You haven't returned my calls.
I'm just trying to disconnect.
Be happy or something.
I get that.
Look...
I think Oliver's going to ask you for a job.
I need you to promise me that you'll say no.
I haven't asked for much...
I mean, anything, really...
Oliver's never coming to work for me.
You swear?
Because he'll, uh, he'll find things out.
We'd ruin him.
Yeah, exactly.
He'd become the new Asher.
I won't let that happen.
You have my word.
I could encrypt the firm's files, update your firewalls.
That way, no one like me could hack you.
Because I totally could.
Not that I have. I haven't.
Uh... so don't worry, but... you're very vulnerable.
Here's my proposal.
Also, the thing that I really wanted to tell you is...
I admire you.
And I know what other people say about you, but...
What do they say?
No, not about you specifically, but, um... defense attorneys.
I think it's so unfair.
Because what I see you do is help people who can't help themselves.
I want to be a part of that.
I'm not hiring anyone right now.
I deleted Connor's Stanford acceptance.
I knew they might call, too, or send a follow-up e-mail, so I hacked their system and had those re-routed to me.
- He doesn't know.
- But you're telling me?
I know what you do here.
That it's not always... good.
So I just wanted to be very clear with you.
I can be bad, too.
Who wants another mojito?
- Oh, keep 'em comin'.
- Yas, queen!
None for me.
Ooh, because you're pregnant with Frank's baby?
No, because I am trying to be a good student.
Boring!
I...didn't know we were having a party.
Hey, Oli!
Where were you?
Oh, I went for a walk in the park.
Hashtag unemployment.
Dawg, that makes it sound like you were cruising for the D.
So, how was everybody's summer?
Any new significant others, besides Wes' little lady?
Not me.
Ask Laurel. She's single again.
You still haven't heard from Frank?
- Nope.
- I bet he's living in South America, just off the fat of the land, whacking bush.
God, I miss that beard.
I don't.
I should go.
Going to get it in with Meggy Weggy?
That's not her actual name, right?
It's Megan or Margaret.
I'm gonna go work on Karim's case.
Who chooses to call themselves Meggy?
Am I hitting the spot?
Oh, God, yes.
Someone put up a flier of me on campus.
It said "killer."
Don't worry.
It's probably just some student whose feelings I hurt.
You tell the new president?
So she has reason to be up my ass again?
No.
It's harassment, Annalise.
I knew I shouldn't have told you.
All I'm saying is, whoever did this could be unstable.
I'm unstable.
Maybe they need to be protected from me.
Your turn.
I said roll over.
Mmm.
Oh, my God, that feels good.
- Sorry to barge in.
- What now?
Well, you know how I'm not really talking to my mom?
Uh, well, that means I'm not getting any support from her, uh, financially, and with next year's tuition due...
I need a loan, basically.
You think I'm joking?
No. I think you're serious.
Please, Annalise, I'm really struggling here.
Yeah, because your white ass has struggled a day in its life.
Okay, my white ass is only in this position because of you.
Excuse me?
My dad was perfectly happy to pay my way, but now he's dead because
I chose you over him.
Well, that's your version of the truth, not mine.
You need some money? Get a job, like everyone else.
Jerk.
I should've looked into
Karim's public defender, argued ineffective assistance of counsel.
My perfect breasts are in your face, and you want to talk about the case?
Right. Stay put. We got options.
Ooh.
Ooh.
The Extender... not that I need it.
Are those from the bowl in the hallway?
Just one of the perks of the new crib.
Asher! Are you in there?
Ignore her.
Sorry. I'm on duty.
- Miladies.
- Show him.
Eh! If it's a rash, you go to the infirmary for that.
Chad texted her back, but she doesn't know what it means.
It means he's over me, right?
Look, we're gonna have to have a conversation later about... having conversations.
But now I need you to peer-process this.
Hey, what are you doing? Get naked!
I'm a grown-ass woman.
I can't be having sex in dorm rooms.
Uh, of course you can.
Otherwise, you're just discriminating against me
'cause I'm poor now.
Welcome to America.
Don't worry. You can't mess this up.
Because there's no way to win.
The defense only wins 3% of the cases in this court, which means you literally have nothing to lose.
Just try to enjoy it.
Karim Assaf is a good man...
A dedicated father, a kind neighbor.
He steps up when help is needed...
- This is so corny.
- Poor Karim.
Poor Karim's children.
He is a leader in his community.
But you don't have to take my word for it.
Take theirs.
The 15 people who've come to attest to the upstanding character of my client.
Okay, he's kind of killing it.
Each person you see here has their own story of his selflessness, generosity, good citizenship, and, above all, his integrity.
- She's so predictable.
- What?
I know how to win.
I was thinking about the drug charge, how if we could prove
Karim's public defender provided ineffective assistance of counsel...
Hey, that was my idea.
Except you didn't go to the public defender to record him saying this.
Did you or did you not tell your client that pleading guilty would cost him his green card?
I'm saying I don't know!
He doesn't remember.
But Padilla v. Kentucky says defense attorneys must advise clients about risks of deportation when pleading guilty.
- Mr. Drake, you're out.
- What?!
Ms. Pratt just turned this case on its head.
Bonnie, you take my place. Mr. Walsh, with me.
You two, stall.
I'd like to call the defense's first witness to the stand...
Mr. Nasim Darwish, our client's imam at his mosque.
You just give the name, young lady... no biography.
Sorry.
Did you or did you not tell your client that pleading guilty would cost him his green card?
I'm saying I don't know!
Sign the motion to vacate,
I'll be out of your hair.
He said, "I don't know."
That doesn't mean he didn't tell your client.
Doesn't mean he did, either.
I need my boss to sign off on it.
And let's face it, Annalise...
He's not about to help you after all the crap you put us through this year.
And what does Mr. Assaf do at your hardware store?
He's our stockroom manager.
And just what does that job entail?
Uh... taking care of the stockroom.
The defense calls Myriam
Mahmoud-Faizan to the stand.
- Carol Lunn.
- Jodie Mayer.
- Khalid El Baur.
- Ashley Chang.
- Owen Marconi.
- Katrina Barberi.
- Makram Azia. Faraj Shah.
- Gina Brown. Steven Mason.
- Jamal Ibrahim.
- This is what we'll do.
Drop the original charge to possession only.
You get your guilty plea, but it's a misdemeanor now.
That way, my client has a chance of remaining with his family.
Everyone wins.
What about the daughter?
I can make her cry on the stand.
Or she'll end up telling the truth.
Ms. Winterbottom, either call your next witness or I'm making my decision.
We'd like to call Faiza
Assaf, Your Honor.
I told Annalise she can't testify.
It'll buy us time.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Your Honor, I have a new plea to present to the court.
Approach.
This reduces Mr. Assaf's felony to a misdemeanor, which makes him eligible to remain in the country.
I move for his immediate release.
Your Honor, Mr. Assaf pled guilty to this charge months ago.
Let's take a recess, and
I'll give my decision after.
Mr. Walsh.
- We're gonna win this thing, right?
- Who the hell knows?
We need to talk about your boyfriend.
- Why?
- I'm gonna hire him.
No.
You looked me in the eye and promised me...
Do you know he deleted your Stanford acceptance?
And he has the capacity to hack my files... God forbid.
Point is, he's farther down the rabbit hole than we thought.
I'll hire him to work in the clinic, we'll bury him in busywork.
No more sticking his nose where it doesn't belong.
Sound good?
They're not gonna file anything.
Get up.
Michaela.
I know now why you're not supposed to meet your heroes.
You're gonna pick a fight after
I saved your drunk ass from jail?
I was drunk. I am totally sober now.
Say what you need to say.
No.
This is a child's behavior.
You're better than this.
Oh, my God! Was that a compliment?
You're very smart and pretty.
Is that what you want to hear?
- Get in the car!
- God!
You can't just expect us to be like you!
I am trying... I am...
But the idea that we're just supposed to go back to being normal, become stupid lawyers...
Well, I'm not normal anymore!
You were never normal!
You just didn't know it until now.
God, you're such a bitch.
You were strong enough to run away from a bad family, so you're strong enough to get through this.
That's why I never worried about you.
Next time you want to drink yourself silly, call me.
I have a full liquor cabinet, and I won't let you drive home drunk.
Okay?
Now let's go.
We look like we're working the corner at this point.
We are back on the record in the deportation proceeding of Karim Assaf.
Mr. Assaf, it troubles me deeply that you pled guilty to a distribution charge you're now saying you did not commit.
Can you tell me why you did this?
I hoped it would minimize the chances of me getting deported.
So you lied under oath?
Your Honor, I think you should stick to the law.
Yes. And I am sorry for that.
Mr. Assaf, this admission calls into question your integrity, as well as everything positive that was said about you in this courtroom today.
I've therefore come to the conclusion that, despite the excessive community support shown here...
I'm going to order your deportation.
Objection! The prior felony has been vacated!
- Sit down.
- Judge, there's no legal obligation!
- Enough!
- This is up to your discretion!
- Just let me tell them the truth!
- Stop it!
But nothing about this makes sense!
It's such a waste.
Justice is the exception.
You should know that by now.
Take the anger that you're feeling and put it into your next case.
Hey.
So... you're gonna be mad, but
Annalise offered me a job, and I want to take it, so...
Yeah, she told me. Um...
I think it's a great idea.
You do?
Yeah. I do.
She also told me about Stanford.
Is it true?
All right, uh... here's the thing.
The fact that you felt that you had to do that,
I mean, that tells me that, you know,
I just... I wasn't listening when you said that you didn't want to move.
I was just putting my feelings before yours.
And I'm sorry for that.
You're sorry?
Yeah.
This...
This isn't okay.
You get to be angry.
- But I'm not.
- Well, you should be.
- Says who?
- Anybody who hears this story!
I stole an amazing opportunity from you...
Yeah, and... And I'm forgiving you.
Which isn't okay! You should be pissed off.
And... And yelling.
But the fact that you're not is...
Maybe we're just both messed up, or the sex is so good that we can't see it, but this is not what a healthy relationship looks like.
We're the best relationship that I know.
Well, then, that's really sad.
How is that sad? I love you, Oliver.
Wow. Seriously?
That's your response to finding out I lied to you?
- Everyone lies in relationships.
- No. No.
I don't.
Or, at least, I don't want to be someone who does.
So...
"So"?
"So" what?
I love you.
I love you so much.
Okay, now you're scaring me.
Just... Hey, let me say this.
You've been so good to me.
Like, you stayed with me even when most guys would've run, but... you didn't even bat an eye.
You just loved me.
And you loved me back.
I know, but I'm different now than when we first met.
- How is that my fault?
- It's not your fault.
I just don't know who I am anymore.
We all go through that...
Yeah, but I think it would be better for me if I went through it alone.
So, what?
You're saying that you, uh...
Do you want to take a break or something?
I think we should break up.
Professor Keating. I'm so sorry to make you wait.
You're the new president.
Everyone wants a piece of you.
Congratulations, by the way.
Thank you. Let's see how long I last.
Please, have a seat.
Well, first... let me say I'm an admirer.
You've broken many a glass ceiling on this campus.
That's nice but not true.
Take the compliment.
Thank you.
You're wondering why you're here.
I am.
We've decided to transition you into a research position this year and have a new professor teach
Introduction to Criminal Law.
I wanted you to hear it directly from me, as I know how important that class is to you.
We simply think it's the best decision for you and the university.
Because you know what's best for me?
I'm on your side, Annalise.
There's not that many of us...
- Then fire me for real.
- Nobody wants that.
Then what do you want?
Because it seems to me you're punishing one of your most esteemed professors due to tragedies in her personal life.
Actually... it's precisely because of your performance as a professor that we've made this decision.
The students who work at your firm have historically graduated at the top of their class.
The five from this year, however, all rank in the bottom 10%.
- How about a pro bono clinic?
- Annalise...
My reputation's a concern for you. That's clear.
So why not give me a chance to repair it?
I'll circle back with the others, let you know what they think.
You see this?
Oh.
Good thing it's not a real newspaper.
The president contact you yet?
I'm ignoring her calls.
You think it's Frank putting them up?
No.
Because he's dead?
I'd understand.
He could destroy us all if he wanted.
Like I don't know that.
It's all Sam's fault.
He's the one who made me hire Frank.
Now look.
I'm no killer, Bonnie.
And God forbid I let
Frank make me into one.
Bastard's not worth it.
Sorry. I... thought you were Meggy.
You decorated?
- Yeah.
- Meggy's idea?
She's really nice.
- Nicer than me, you mean.
- I didn't say that.
Why are you being such a jerk?
Fine.
- I'll go.
- Laurel, I...
You won't even respond to my texts!
I'm sorry.
I don't want you to be sorry.
I just want you to talk to me.
I want that, too.
Well, then what's wrong?
When I look at you... all I see is Frank.
And I need to forget what he did.
I will never forgive him for what he did to you.
- You know that, right?
- Of course.
And I... I wish I didn't... equate you with him.
I just...
Uh...
Meggy's on her way.
I should go.
- Hi.
- Hi!
I'm Laurel. I'm Wes' friend.
I was just here to drop off an outline...
Wait. Like, the Laurel?
Wes talks about you all the time.
- He does?
- Yes.
And no handshakes. I'm a hugger.
Come here.
Hey.
- What is it?
- I found him.
So... do or die.
What do you want to do?
You there?
Annalise?
Annalise?
Hang up the phone!
I said hang up!
You got a creaky stair.
I can fix it if you want.
Hey.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I live here! Please!
Ma'am! Just calm down!
Who is it?!
A little respect, please!
- Calm down!
- Who is it? Tell me!
Tell me!
Hey!
- Get her!
- Hey! Ma'am!
Ma'am, let me just see.
Ma'am, I'm not authorized to let you...
No, I know that. I live here.
No!
No!
No!!
No!!
No!
No!!

 With Murder"...
- We're gonna play a game.
-Meet Bonnie.
What the hell is this?
Bonnie's childhood.
And that man is her father.
I love you.
Whatever you want,
I'll do it.
So, please, just let me.
I'm sorry.
Can I crash here for a while?
We're screwing.
- There is an article on Annalise in almost every single paper.
This is a big deal.
You are suspended.
No.
Annalise, please.
No one here --
Lock me out of my classroom!
Are you worried
Frank's behind the fliers?
You think that Frank might try to pin Mahoney's shooting on me.
- I didn't have a choice.
He's dead.
So, he could be anywhere.
I'm gonna stay at your house till we find him.
It's Laurel.
She's been calling Frank.
What's the deal with your father?
He is not a good person.
Frank, I love you.
Please come back to us.
Now you just got to go see your father.
Wipe it clean.
Everything on it.
- Annalise Keating, you're under arrest.
Pull it together, Hampton.
There was no phone with your belongings.
Did you lose it?
I must've dropped it when your colleagues manhandled me.
My job is hard enough without you giving me attitude.
Here.
Look straight into the camera, please.
Hey.
Hmm.
Made a smoothie.
You can take it with you.
Does it have bacon in it?
Try it before you judge.
It's good.
Your crack's ready, too.
Oh.
So you know,
I filed a missing person report on Frank.
What?!
That was a test.
I haven't done anything -- yet.
Nate.
So, you'd just rather I wait until he does something terrible?
Nothing terrible's gonna happen.
I'm handling it.
How?
This is all my fault.
I shouldn't have involved you.
It would be better for the both of us if we just keep certain things separate for a while.
Church and state.
Now you care about that?
I care about not hurting you again.
You don't trust me.
That's not what this is about.
Or am I confused about what exactly we're doing here?
I don't know what we're doing, but neither do you.
Look, can we just not decide that right now?
Let's just see where it goes.
See where it goes, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
You're gonna make me late for work again.
Smoothie.
Good morning.
I hope you're here because you found the person behind those fliers.
We're still looking into it.
Look harder.
Annalise, please --
You blindsided me at the meeting.
And I apologize for that.
I --
But?
Honestly, if I were just a spectator in that boardroom,
I would've stood up and cheered.
Maybe you should have.
Then we wouldn't be in this predicament.
Well, we're in this predicament because you insist on making everything a fight.
My entire career's under attack.
Everything is a fight for me right now.
Exactly.
I can be on your side if you just work with me.
You enjoy this?
Being the good girl collecting gold stars from the board.
You don't know me.
I just came to say that
I think I can manage this.
All I need you to do is your part.
Keep a low profile.
Might be hard with my new case.
What does that mean?
Annalise?
Annalise!
- Hey, what's that?
Zoom in.
Is she dead?
-She looks dead.
-Holy --
Meet our next client,
Toby Solomon, also known as...?
Mr. Millstone.
The Call Girl Creeper.
He was doing liquid "G" with an escort when she passed out, so he dumped her body outside the apartment.
She died of respiratory failure two days later.
"She" being
Virginia Michaelson.
Her overdose is caught on a neighbor's live video feed.
Ms. Gunderson.
Solomon is a heartless real-estate developer.
In what world does he need a pro bono clinic?
One -- put aside your personal feelings when assessing a client.
Two -- he was bankrupted by this case.
Because he fired like
10 of his attorneys when they told him to take a plea deal.
Five of his attorneys, and don't speak unless called on.
Now, we're joining this mid-trial.
The prosecution is halfway through the case, and has done a pretty good job with the jury.
So, how do we undo that?
Really?
I'm handing you a tabloid murder case, and no one wants to sit with me at the table?
I do.
Great, it's your case,
Ms. Pratt.
-What about the contest?
-Do over!
I'll see you in court tomorrow.
We don't have time for games.
Make me proud.
You're on time. That's one thing you can get right.
What can I say?
I'm used to working with women who get paid by the hour.
Who's this?
Ms. Pratt.
She's just joining our team.
You hit on her... and I'll cut off your balls.
- Ms. Perez, what type of information were you able to gather about the defendant, his Internet activity in particular?
On average, Mr. Solomon procured an escort three times a week.
He also had a blog where he graded the women based on factors such as breast size, pubic hair, and vocal enthusiasm.
I was young.
I don't do that anymore.
Is there anything else you found that might be relevant to this case?
I did a search of the deleted images from his Snipcam and found one particular selfie that is illuminating.
Objection. This image was not disclosed to us pre-trial, thereby violating rule 573.
-Rule 573.
The defendant's Snipcam cache was always in the discovery,
Your Honor.
Perhaps Ms. Keating just didn't search hard enough.
If it requires a computer expert to decipher discovery,
I move for a continuance.
We can't delay this case again because the defendant has a penchant for changing lawyers.
Let me remind the A.D.A. that this type of bad faith data dumping is prohibited under United States v. Warshak.
-United States v. Warshak.
-Stop.
- Let me see the evidence before making a decision.
Approach.
Please warn me if that's what I think it is.
That is not a ween
I want to be seeing.
Motion to exclude on the basis of tampering.
The A.D.A. concealed this evidence, violating 4910.
I'm offended.
We have fully complied with our discovery obligations.
I find no evidence of bad faith.
Your Honor, this rises to the level of reversible error.
Your objection is noted for the record.
Let's continue.
Ms. Perez, at what time did the defendant post this selfie which you will now show us?
-12:13 a.m.
-Let the record state that this photo was posted seven minutes before
Mr. Solomon bothered to call 911.
Seven minutes that could've saved Virginia's life.
Your witness.
I'd like to appeal for recusal as first chair as this case offends my sensibilities as a woman.
I'm okay with being offended.
We don't bail on our clients, Ms. Pratt.
I know. I just think you'd be better assisted by a student who's not so personally disgusted.
Ow! Mr. Walsh, call your boyfriend, and have him check every hidden cavity of Toby's computer and phone.
Oliver's not his boyfriend anymore.
What did you do?
It was his decision.
It's fine.
I'll call him.
Everybody else go back to clinic.
Prep Toby for the stand.
Wait, we're putting that perv on the stand?
I don't feel like that's an appropriate way to speak about a client.
You'll get over it.
Wes.
Have you heard from Laurel?
Yeah. She's at her grandmother's funeral.
No, she's not.
I sent her to see her father.
Why?
I thought I was meeting you upstairs.
I couldn't wait.
Let me look at you.
"Smart" might also be a compliment a daughter likes to hear.
No fights, okay?
This is a social visit, or are you just here to find your boyfriend?
Well, we'll talk in my office.
Decide if this Frank guy is worth your time.
Did you eat lunch yet?
I can have Diana call down to the chef, make you a salad or something.
You're listening to my calls?
Well, just since you said you were coming to visit.
You leave a lot of voicemails for him.
-Dad!
-What choice do you give me?
You throw a fit a Christmas, you're blocking my e-mails.
Title 18, section 2511 of the U.S. code -- wire tapping is a federal offense punishable by incarceration.
Now I'll tell you that you're smart.
You must be Laurel.
I'm Ursela.
Do you mind giving us a moment?
I need to speak to my father.
Oh, no, that's why
Ursela's here, m'ija.
I'm the in-house executive coach.
I specialize in corporate mediation and conflict resolution.
We have conflict, and Ursela here will help us resolve it.
Sit.
-I hate him.
-Who?
Nate. He threw out all my junk food.
I just hid it, actually.
I love you, you know that?
So, he's living here now?
You don't approve?
No, Nate's great.
Tell your face that.
It's about the case.
I think we should plea out.
You've been begging me for weeks to take a real case, and now you want to quit?
No one will blame you for cutting a deal on this one, and it will help keep the President out of your hair.
The President can suck it.
Annalise.
I'll talk to the D.A.
Just go and make sure our client is not trying to purchase Michaela.
Please, please, please, please don't show her.
Look, I'll do whatever you want.
I'll have sex with you.
Penetration!
Michaela, have you seen this?
-Seen what?
-I hate you.
Um, Aiden, our ex, got engaged.
Her name's Whitney.
Uh, she went to Princeton,
Phi Beta Kappa.
Damn, she's...got nothing on you, and you're way more accomplished.
She's a speech writer for the Governor of Connecticut, so...
With a house in Martha's Vineyard?
Mm-hmm. Looks like her parents have a place in Oak Bluffs, so.
You're way hotter.
Seriously, you're a 9.
8 if I'm being picky.
Back off, bro.
The lady's taken.
Really? 'Cause it seems like she's still in love with that guy.
The lady's taken by me, okay?
I'm her boo, so just take your creeping elsewhere.
Asher.
Uh...
I-I wanted to tell you.
It's just we haven't been alone in a while.
I don't care.
I know.
But I do.
Is anyone prepping our client, or are you all just Googling your exes?
Mostly the latter.
Did he tell you about my mother?
Oh, please! For once, can we not talk about this?
Hear that? "For once."
Okay, apparently, you are not supposed to judge your father for leaving your mother in the middle of a mental-health crisis.
It was a mutual decision.
He met my step-mother one month later -- Elena.
Shady, right?
Will you help me out here, please?
No, no, no, don't put this on her.
It's her job to not take sides.
That's true, but I find focusing on the immediate problems to be the most effective solution.
I prefer to discuss the past.
Did he tell you
I was kidnapped when I was 16?
And my father here, he refused to pay the ransom.
The government wouldn't
 allow me to do anything!
Oh, is that why?
I understand.
I'm sorry, I just thought --
I thought you'd value your daughter's life over what the government...
Oh.
Okay, let's stick to English if I'm gonna help here.
Laurel.
I apologize for all of it.
Every slight I ever committed against you and your mother.
I want to move on, Laurel, and I think you do, too.
You know why I came here, so if you don't want to give me that,
I'll just go back home.
'Cause this isn't it anymore, so let me know what you decide.
Nice work hiding that selfie.
Just stealing one of your moves.
Well, I'll spare you the indignity of asking.
I'm not offering your client any deal.
I haven't even begun my defense.
You don't know what's coming down the road.
Is it better than a selfie with the corpse?
Oh.
Offer me a deal, and you don't have to worry about it.
Okay.
I feel bad having to spell this out, but there's no deal for you here, Annalise.
And when I say here,
I mean this whole office.
That sounds like prosecutorial misconduct to me.
No, no.
Just payback for years of bad behavior.
We're done?
Such confidence.
Another move I stole from you,
I guess.
Except I don't have to fake it.
Wow. Your heart rate is in the 90s.
Is that bad?
It's fast, but that's normal after sex.
I'll just take it as a compliment.
And what's happening now?
Oh, I'm just feeling for any abnormal growths.
You want to celebrate your birthday with a clean bill of health.
I swiped your license while you were in the shower last night.
Why didn't you tell me it was coming up?
'Cause I hate my birthday.
Well, that is only because you've never had me to celebrate it with you.
I'm gonna make it fun.
I promise.
It's Laurel.
Tell her that I'm really sorry about her grandmother, okay?
I will.
Hey.
Hey, I'm sorry it took me so long to call you back.
The mass went on for really, really long.
Annalise told me where you are.
My grandmother did actually die.
Three years ago, so it wasn't a full-on lie.
 I'm not mad.
I just don't want you to do anything you don't want to do.
Doesn't matter anyway 'cause my father probably won't help.
Why not?
I'd prefer not talk about it over the phone.
 You sure?
 Unless you just
 don't want to tell me
 anything about your dad
'cause he's some spy or something.
I'll call you back.
Special delivery.
 Pastel de tres leches.
I'm still pissed at you.
Mmm!
Do you want a bite?
Elena's got me on this whole gluten-free thing.
Since when do you listen to what she says?
Ah.
Mmm.
I spoke to your mother last week.
No, it's good.
I was checking up on her.
She told me you spent the summer there.
Said she was grateful you came.
Are you gonna tell me where he is, Dad?
Frank.
You're chasing after a man who's not worthy of you.
You stalked him, too?
Not yet, but I hear you leave these pathetic messages to a man who clearly doesn't appreciate you.
No, you don't appreciate me.
Is it because of me?
That's why you're picking men who run off on you?
Because you have daddy issues or something?
Whatever Ursela was saying.
You are a textbook narcissist.
You know that?
I found him, Laurel.
This wayward
Italian boyfriend of yours.
Hey, how you doin'?
Frank Delfino.
Really?
Where is he?
It's a new investment I need to put under your name.
I would put it in your brother's name, but he's under water in a deal in Venezuela.
You should leave.
You're a member of this family, and you reap the benefits, m'ija.
That's why I keep wanting to get out of this family.
Can you please go?
 It's Laurel. Leave a message,
but I'll probably never listen.
Hi, just checking in.
Let me know if you need anything.
Want me to make dinner?
Not if it's in a blender.
I need comfort food.
Everything okay?
Or am I not allowed to ask you that with our new rules?
Just an idiot client.
I'm fine.
Come in.
It's about the case.
I'll go.
What is it?
Oliver.
What?
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
Toby withdrew $200,000 in cash from the bank.
Oliver saw the e-mail receipt.
-When?
-An hour ago.
I took this case thinking you were broke.
So, who are you bribing?
A juror?
Or are you just gonna buy another hooker?
No, I told you
I don't buy sex.
Then what are you doing with the money?
It's for my last lawyer.
You want to fire me?
Go for it.
He's blackmailing me.
For what?
How do I know you just won't blackmail me, too?
Well, congratulations.
You've just gone through six lawyers in one case.
It must be a record.
I'll tell you!
Just you have to promise not to --
Attorney-client privilege.
Only a hack would blackmail you.
What'd you do?
I killed a girl.
Virginia?
No.
Her name was Janie.
- It's all fake, Michaela.
If she were really happy, she wouldn't have to post photos of herself looking happy.
- Go home.
You're off the case.
But I'm first chair.
No, you just stood up first.
Now go.
Your sensibilities as a woman should be relieved.
Is that the money?
Doesn't matter.
Just leave.
Well, I'm free the rest of the night if you want to grab a drink or something.
Michaela?
Call Connor.
Tell him we're going out.
She was just some girl
I met on the street.
A hooker?
No.
I don't think so.
She was a runaway.
Janie Sherwin.
Missing since April, 2012.
She was 18.
That's her.
It's good, right?
So. You like baseball,
I assume?
Yeah.
Baseball and hot girls.
I think you got the wrong idea.
I just got triggered.
I know it -- it doesn't make it okay, but...
You seriously thought that we were gonna hook up?
I mean...look at you.
You shouldn't talk to people like that.
Just keeping it real.
It's harder than people think... going through life like this, getting bullied for how I look.
Join a gym.
Get some plastic surgery.
Maybe then someone will have sex with you, because honestly, even if you gave me all the coke in the world, nothing's worth the PTSD of having your gross, sweaty, hairy-ass body on top of mine.
Like, I would rather swallow a jar of razor blades --
We've all been called names.
What'd you do with her?
There's an abandoned warehouse
I almost bought in Manayunk.
I left her in a broken freezer.
- Turn up the A/C 'cause we about to destroy this joint!
That's right, baby!
We in you, Atlantic city!
-So, what's our plan?
Drink enough to forget that gay Aiden's getting straight married?
Drunk enough to forget men exist.
Except for us, right?
'Cause we're the woke ones.
Hey. Uh, can I just say how happy this makes me, that we can hang out and not make this weird?
Uh, what? You thought
I couldn't do that?
Of -- Of course I did.
I just, uh -- it means a lot to me that we can be friends.
I never said that we're friends.
Let's see how the night goes.
Maybe we can get there.
-It's 20 grand.
-Whoa.
-Where did you get that?
-Borrowed it from Toby.
Wait, that's why you wanted to come here?
In what world did you think it was okay to steal that money?
-This is stolen money?
-He's kidding.
It's my husband's.
Bastard's cheating on me.
Can you believe it? We're getting the hell out of here.
Go if you want to.
I'm happy right here.
All on black.
-Michaela, what -- okay.
No more bets.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
8, black.
There are no bad ideas right now.
We tell the D.A.
Except that one.
You need good press.
What's better than helping recover the body of a missing girl?
We haven't even seen the body yet.
For all we know, it doesn't even exist.
Then just say you were compelled...
...for moral and ethical reasons.
Like they'll believe that.
It's -- it's cute, though.
Janie's mother still updates the website every week.
People still e-mail thinking they spotted Janie.
And Rebecca?
You gonna tell the police where to find her body, too?
It could've been me.
If the police hadn't caught my father, I would've run away.
Ended up on the street.
But that didn't happen.
Because someone did the right thing.
I can call in an anonymous tip.
No one will know it was me.
Toby will know.
You can sleep here.
I can tell Nate to leave.
We can eat ice cream in bed, watch a bad movie.
I won't call the police.
I just don't see any reason why you should be alone.
I'm just tired.
I'll go.
13, black.
80 grand in the bank, bitch!
-Whoo!
-What'd I say?
Always bet black!
And I'll never go back!
No.
-You staying in the hotel?
-No, no, no.
We're only here for the night.
Oh! Okay, cool.
I'll tell you, if she keeps playing like this... Oh, hell no.
...they're gonna comp you guys a suite probably. Oh, yeah?
Yeah. You got to throw a party.
Oh.
You should.
They give you one of those, uh -- the Jacuzzi tubs.
Dude, you got to put your peen between the O-man and that him-bo over there.
Yeah, he's hot.
You're hot, okay?
So go over there and show that queen who's boss.
We broke up, Asher.
That doesn't mean you just quit him, brokeback.
You got to fight for it.
 He quit on me!
Okay?
He's very secure in his decision.
He doesn't want to be with me.
Maybe he wants to be with that guy, I don't know.
But you trying to be our Yenta or -- or parent trapping us or whatever, it's really not helpful.
Walshy needs a hug.
-No.
-27, red.
Did she just say red?
Oh, no.
No! No! No! No! No!
Hey, you need a drink?
It's rum and Coke.
Uh, you know,
I'm actually driving, but you -- you should give it to Oliver.
That's his drink.
Yeah, but I, uh --
I brought it to you.
I'm saying he's the better choice, so...
Look, he's a monster in bed.
Asian guys aren't really my type.
But, uh, you...
So, you're a bigot?
What are you talking about?
I'm stating a preference.
Let me guess, you're -- you're only into masc dudes, too, right?
Your Humpr profile, it's all,
"No fats, no femmes, no blacks, no Asians."
Look, man, I think you just need to relax.
Or I need to kick your ass!
- Hey, what's going on?
I think I'm gonna go find my friends.
What did you say?
Nothing, but, you know, dodged a bullet.
Because you sabotaged me.
No.
No, I would never do that.
Except you just did.
Walshy. Please, please, please tell me you just won 20k on the slots.
Hmm? What?
I lost some of the money.
No, not some of it.
 All of it.
Like we have zero left, zilch, negative Benjamins.
Michaela.
I just wanted to have fun.
Yeah, well, I'm having a lot of fun.
How about you guys?
- I still pray
 I'll open the door
 and she'll be standing there,
 that I'll be able
 to hold her again.
 Mama's still here
 for you, baby girl.
I'll always be waiting for you.
You gonna keep that up all night?
Probably.
Frank stuff?
No.
How about this?
What's said in the dark doesn't leave this room.
That applies to the both of us.
What secrets do you have?
Right now, we're focused on you.
There's a dead girl in a freezer, and I can't do anything about it.
Hey, Frank.
You think I'm stupid, don't you?
Think I'm gonna fall for those voicemails?
 No, Frank.
Annalise isn't mad at you.
She tried to kill me,
Laurel.
 She tell you that?
 Just tell her this, okay?
 We're even.
Wait, don't say anything else.
No need to send any more hit men my way.
Just --
Sorry.
I saw you flirting, and I got jealous, so I told him...to back off.
It won't happen again.
No, it will.
It's fine.
You're allowed to be angry with me, but it's not like
I was gonna go hook up with the guy in the bathroom.
Yeah, no, I know. I --
Sorry.
I don't want you to be sorry.
I want you to act like an adult.
You're right.
I will do better.
-So, do we have a deal?
-$15,000. Take it or leave it.
That's a 2.5 karat with D color and flawless clarity that he -- that I paid $45,000 for.
And this is a 24/7 pawn shop.
You don't like it, go on eBay.
$30,000.
$16,000.
$28,000.
$17,000.
$21,000 or I file a report with the FTC that you entered into a negotiation of sale before confirming that I was the legal owner of the ring, resulting in you losing your license.
- Okay, that was hot.
Like, I want you to sit on my face right now hot.
And a grand in profit?
Are you kidding me?
He was like,
"This is not eBay."
That's 1,000 bucks.
I could use that.
It's blood money.
- I got arrested the night Virginia died.
I spent a couple nights in the county jail before my lawyer could get bail.
- And during this time, did you speak to any other inmates?
Yes, there was a, uh, man in my cell block.
-Why is he on the stand?
-Shh.
And what did this man tell you?
He asked me if I knew about this girl Janie Sherwin from the news.
And why did he seem interested in this girl?
He said he'd killed her and hid her in a freezer.
Objection. Relevance.
My client is trying to tell the truth about this girl who's been missing for years.
-Again, relevance.
-It's relevant because it proves my client has been unable to get a fair trial in the city of Philadelphia.
-Objection. Inflammatory.
-A very serious accusation,
Ms. Keating.
-You want proof?
Here.
I'd like to enter into evidence a prison record sheet of my client the night he was arrested.
You'll see that he was placed in the same cell block as an inmate named
Jackson Terry...
Jackson Terry's got four counts of first-degree murder, all women, all violent.
You just say they crossed paths.
Terry confessed.
...who confessed his crime to my client.
Now, it was not my intention to discuss this matter in open court, but Ms. Atwood refused to even hear my offer yesterday.
Because Ms. Keating never said anything about a murdered girl.
I never had the chance.
In fact, Ms. Atwood inferred that no one in the D.A.'s office would negotiate with me.
That is a lie,
Your Honor.
Did we not meet yesterday in your office?
Yes --
Did you not say that my reputation was the sole reason why you wouldn't negotiate with me, which let's be clear, is the very definition of prosecutorial bias.
Judge, I can explain.
You should explain.
To Janie Sherwin's mother,
Sharon, who's been suffering for years not knowing whether her daughter's dead or alive.
My client is attempting to end that suffering, but your prejudice against me won't allow it.
Your Honor, it's no secret that my reputation has suffered in this courthouse.
I can handle it.
But I won't allow it to keep my client from getting a fair trial.
Three years. You just need to plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter.
Three years in jail?
You let one woman die in the street and another rot in a freezer.
God knows you deserve worse.
But I hired you because you said you'd get me no jail time!
You killed two innocent women, and you still think you get to complain?
Say you'll take the deal!
Say it!
Okay.
Is this a goodbye, or should
I call Ursela back in again?
No need.
I just came to drop this off.
I, uh, can't thank you enough.
I scratch your back, you scratch mine.
It's quite clever.
He used a pretty sophisticated program to hide his location, but we were able to find him in a town called Coalport.
It's near Pittsburgh.
He's been there about a week.
I'll let you get back to work.
How well do you know this man, m'ija?
I'm an adult.
I can decide who I want in my life, so no more spying on me.
No more bugging my phone.
I wouldn't need to if you'd just return my calls.
Listen.
I know why you're angry.
I understand.
I never saw you, not this person you've become.
I see her now.
You've taken everything you've been through, all the pain, and you turned it into strength.
And for that,
I am proud of you.
Very, very proud.
 Por favor, please don't ever disappear on me like that again.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Can I help you?
Or did you just come to return the money you stole?
It was beyond stupid.
I know.
I was just angry at men, especially rich ones who don't appreciate what they have.
Just put it back.
Bonnie.
I'm sorry about Asher.
We were gonna tell you --
God, you just ruined it.
What?
We don't need to make this a thing, Michaela.
Bone whoever you want.
What do I do with this?
Keep it. See if he has the nerve to ask for it back.
Look.
- President Hargrove?
What is it, Candice?
 Barry Lewiston
 is on the phone.
Of course he is.
Hi, Barry.
Yes, I am reading it right now.
 It's Laurel. Leave a message,
but I'll probably never listen.
Hey. Are you back?
Call me.
Sorry, I was just, uh --
Calling Laurel?
I know.
I'm about to start my E.R. rotation.
And people's lives literally will depend on me.
Instead of me focusing on that,
I've been stressing about what to get you for your birthday while you're into some other girl.
It's not like that.
I want to believe you.
But then I see your face when her name shows up on your phone.
My face?
You get...happy.
In a way, that makes me happy for you.
Because God knows that you deserve nothing but good things at this point in your life.
 You're the good thing in my life.
Not Laurel.
It's you.
You don't have to get me anything for my birthday.
Too late.
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.
I got a little paranoid using the phone around my dad.
It's fine.
Did he find Frank?
Yes, but he wouldn't tell me where he was unless I signed my soul over to him, and I couldn't do it, not again.
I'm sorry,
I really wanted to help.
Fathers suck.
I think we can all agree on that.
Yeah.
I think we all need a drink.
No!
- Excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me.
What are you doing here?
Annalise called me from jail.
Did you do it?
Do what?
The phone.
She sent me to find you.
It's clean.
Good.
Follow me.
Now, Miss, you need clearance to come in --
I'm Annalise Keating's lawyer.
This is her house.
John!
All right.
Come on, Bonnie.
This is an active crime scene.
Just tell me what the charges are, and I'll get out of your hair.
And have the chief tear me a new one?
I don't think so.
Are you not telling me because you don't have a case?
This arrest is just for headlines?
Look, you'll get your charges soon enough, just not from me.
You can only hold her for
48 hours without charging her.
Yeah, and that's --
- Hold up!
Everybody quiet!
- Rescue 1.
 Rescue 1 priority.
This is Gaines.
Talk to me.
 We have another occupant.
 We're bringing them out now.
Status?
Status?!
 There's a pulse.
 I repeat, we have a pulse.
Get an ambulance ready.
Line up a police escort for the hospital.
Come on, everyone!
Let's go!

## S03E4

 Previously on "How to
 Get Away with Murder"...
-Who the hell is this?
-Laurel. Hi.
If the police hadn't caught my father, I would've run away.
Ms. Atwood inferred that no one would negotiate with me.
That is a lie,
Your Honor.
You killed two innocent women.
Say you'll take the deal!
Say it!
Look.
-  President Hargrove?
What is it?
 Barry Lewiston
 is on the phone.
Hi, Barry.
I've been stressing about what to get you for your birthday while you're into some other girl.
 You're the good thing in my life.
Not Laurel.
- So, he could be anywhere.
I'm gonna stay at your house till we find him.
Hey, Frank.
She tried to kill me,
Laurel.
We were able to find your boyfriend in a town called Coalport.
Did he find Frank?
Yes, but he wouldn't tell me where he was.
-Talk to me.
 -We have another occupant
 There's a pulse.
 I repeat, we have a pulse.
- Who is it?
Tell me!
- Annalise Keating, you're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say...
Wipe it clean.
I'm sorry it took so long.
Do you know what they're charging me with?
No, not yet.
You have to find out.
I know.
I can't just stay in here until they throw the book at me.
Annalise.
They found another body in the house.
They're alive, but we don't know who it is.
Pupils are reactive.
I need two large bore I.V.s.
Start fluids at 150.
There's a lot of soot in the mucus membrane.
X-ray's on its way, and I sent for the blood gas and CBC.
How bad are the burns?
Roughly 9% BSA in the right arm and leg.
O2 stats are dropping.
Probably smoke inhalation.
We need to intubate.
Give me the fiber-optic device.
Two more, please.
Everything okay?
Yeah, just work.
Liar.
Oh, thank God.
Thank you.
So, what's up with those fliers?
Did they find the creep who put them up?
Let's just not talk about my disaster of a life.
That just leaves us to talk about my boring life.
I'd kill for a boring life right now.
You let Nate move in.
That's pretty boring.
Is it the sex?
It's that good?
We're not doing this.
You're right.
I don't want to know.
You're happy, I'm happy.
I didn't say I was happy.
Stressed out, pissed off, lonely, sure, but -- oh.
Let me guess, you just got promoted to partner at Saatchi, and you're helping your friend celebrate?
I got partner a long time ago, and my friend here is actually my girlfriend.
Lesbian Heisman.
That's good. We haven't seen that one in a while.
It's fine if you're not interested.
We can handle that.
Oh, no, we're interested in free drinks.
Good, uh, but just to be clear, you are or are not gay?
I'm gay. She's...
It's complicated.
Awesome.
We're litigators.
We do complicated for a living.
Hm.
Tell me you didn't drive home.
No, officer.
I took a cab.
Okay, let's get you to bed.
No, no, no, no, no.
I can do this.
I can do this much.
Okay, okay. Here we go.
All right.
All right, no,
I can't do this.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I know.
Okay. All right.
- I'm coming.
You're late.
I'm here now.
Money?
Careful where you stow it, or you'll blow yourself up.
I'm good.
 It's Frank.
 Leave a message.
It's me.
I got rid of my old phone for reasons I'll explain in person.
Just -- this is my new number.
Please call me.
You coming?
Dude, you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
It's just a gland issue.
I just -- when that, you know,
"All rise" hits, it's go time.
I'm all like "Pow, pow" with legal hooks, cross-exam jabs, and you got nothing to worry about.
It's going to be fine.
Is that sweat?
Like, it's making its way through his suit jacket?
Ain't jealousy a bitch?
Please. Annalise only picked your boyfriend for this case 'cause he's hooked up to one of her teats like the rest of you.
Wait, we're calling him your boyfriend now?
God no. It's just sex.
Pretty good sex from all the noise you two have been making.
Uh, you want to sleep on the street?
'Cause I'm happy to have my couch back.
Yeah, well, that might happen if I keep hitting the jackpot at your building.
What does that mean?
The silver fox, the -- the one from the fifth floor, he invited me over for dinner tonight, but I'm pretty sure the only thing I'm gonna be eating is --
Are you kidding me?
This is a courtroom -- maybe not the most appropriate place to be discussing your sex life.
Are you jealous because you don't have a sex life of your own?
If you want, I can give you some pointers.
Oliver's been giving me all the pointers I need, thanks.
Where have you been?
Hungover.
What's wrong?
I just wanted to introduce you to the character witnesses.
Uh, guys,
Professor Keating.
This is Rosette,
Susan, Jeremy.
We're some of
Tristan's teachers.
Thank you so much for taking this case.
Honestly, you're our hero right now.
Thank Mr. Millstone.
He's doing all the heavy lifting.
Be on your "A" game, because my brain is steeped in vodka.
- All rise!
- As you can see here, the juvenile is on video taking out the maximum amount allowed on the credit card --
$1,000.
This is just one example of how Tristan Fullerton used fake credit cards to steal a total of $41,000 over the last two months -- money he claims he can't pay back.
So, the state is recommending the maximum sentencing of seven years in juvenile detention.
The floor is yours, young man.
You sure you shouldn't just do this?
I mean, he just nailed it --
Get up.
Sorry, uh,
Tristan Fullerton was raised in the streets of Nicetown, which actually should've been called Meantown due to it having a very high crime rate -- crime that visited
Tristan's own home in the form of abuse.
He ended up in foster care as a result, getting moved from one home to another to another.
Getting moved from one home to another to another.
Oh, God, tell me when it's over.
Now as a result of these charges, he's been moved once again to his seventh foster home.
Your Honor, I ask that you censure the prosecution for this rude display of whispering!
My apologies, Judge, but I just, uh, found out that the juvenile here is represented by an unlicensed lawyer.
Mr. Millstone is one of my law students I've been supervising.
Oh, I was talking about you, Ms. Keating.
My office just received this fax from the Disciplinary Board stating that your license has been placed under immediate suspension due to gross misconduct.
- Ms. Keating, is this true?
This was a private courthouse meeting.
My interaction with my client is privileged.
It's physical assault,
Annalise.
Who sent this?
That doesn't matter.
Was it the D.A.'s office?
I mean, who could get their hands on this?
You can defend yourself at the disciplinary hearing next week. I run a pro bono legal clinic.
My clients are immigrants, poor children.
They need me to do my job right now.
And a violation of this manner demands we immediately suspend your license.
I'm sorry.
Damn!
You got a mean right.
Oh, stop.
It was the D.A.'s office.
I humiliated
Atwood in court, and it's their way of hitting back.
You want me to dig around?
Hey.
It's gonna be okay.
I know.
It's just the worst day to be hungover.
Well, maybe don't let Bonnie take you out drinking on a school night anymore.
It's my fault.
I insisted on that second bottle of champagne.
Like I didn't already know that.
- Is what the prosecutor said true?
You guys can't defend me anymore?
My license is up to date, so the case will continue as scheduled tomorrow.
And him, he's still gonna be the first chair or whatever?
Dude, okay, I wasn't that bad, all right?
We'd be in much better shape if you just told us what you did with the money.
I spent it.
I told you.
On what? 'Cause real talk, man, you have one drawer at a group home and Air Jordans from four seasons ago.
Asher. Look, I grew up spending money and even I couldn't blow through that much coin in two months when I was 15.
Sit down!
Over there.
He's right.
This all goes away if you give back the money.
No more court.
No time in juvie.
The money's gone.
How many times do I have to tell you guys that?
- Our client is young, dumb, and suffers from teenage brain disease.
As we all know, the adolescent brain is more reckless than the adult's.
Right? How they barely think about anything other than sex...
...and sex and sex.
Just like some other boys we know.
How are you thinking about sex when we just found out
Annalise's entire career imploded?
Oliver made his bed.
I'm just sleeping in it.
-You know he can hear you.
-I don't mind.
Really.
He's single.
Sex is a healthy part of that.
Besides, I'm on Humpr, too.
Oh, give me your phone.
I'm really good at picking out guys.
-Since when?
-No, you're not.
-I'm not sure that's true.
-Hey, bad table.
Since you guys are all so distracted, how about you do some work gathering research that speaks to the sad state of the teenage brain?
-I have a question.
-Did I say it was time for questions?
-It's for her, actually.
If Annalise is suspended, is it even legal to help this kid?
Yes because I'm now in charge of this case.
Sit down.
Sir!
Goofy-looking table,
I need you guys...
You should hack into the Disciplinary Board e-mails, find out who sent the video.
He doesn't hack anymore.
You do know you don't speak for him anymore.
He's right, I don't.
Unless
Annalise asks me to.
Oliver, now you're just hurting my feelings, bud.
I'm sorry.
You could make it up to me by using your big nerd brain to follow the money.
Okay? Do whatever legal techno mumbo jumbo you have to and figure out where our shady little liar is hiding all of his dough.
On it.
Can I help
Oliver with that?
Whatever you want.
All right, let's get to work, people.
Think about how well everyone's gonna sleep tonight when we realize that we've saved the life of a poor young man.
Where are you going?
Research library.
I remembered this brief about presenting mitigating factors on juvie cases, so...
Have you ever heard of the town called Coalport?
Nope.
Why?
I got a missed call from there last week.
I don't know who it was --
But you was hoping that it was from Frank.
Look, my son can be a real jackass with girls, but I'd probably go AWOL every now and then, too, if I'd been beat up in life like Frankie has.
You mean by Annalise?
No, I mean by his time in jail.
It was Annalise and Sam that saved him from that hell.
- No, really.
Maybe the computer will change its mind the next time.
Sorry, I'm just not sure how
I'm supposed to clean in there.
You're not.
That's why you don't have clearance.
Name's Kevin.
I'm new.
Stay in your lane, Kevin.
Sir, yes, sir.
Everything's under control.
They all think I work for the university.
-  Good.
 Just keep them distracted.
On it. I'll call you if I need anything.
Bonnie.
Yeah?
 If Nate asks,
 tell him that you went to dinner with me last night.
Okay.
 Thank you.
BonBon!
O-man found something.
Actually, it was my idea that led to the finding.
Where is it?
We accessed Tristan's bus pass account.
The accessing might not have been totally legal.
Shh.
I got it.
Each week, he takes the 139 out to Port Richmond.
It's the warehouse district.
There's nothing there --
Except for -- wait for it --
A storage unit facility.
You, uh -- you into some kinky baby play or something?
Tristan.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Yeah.
She's due in five months.
The baby's gonna need things.
I don't want it to grow up like me.
This actually helps your case.
We can tell the judge you were trying to do the right thing.
You can't tell anyone.
Because her parents don't know?
The school.
That's where she works.
I'm sorry to drag you back in here.
We just wanted to make sure you felt fully prepared to take the stand.
Oh, I totally get it.
I'm happy to do whatever I can to make sure
Tristan doesn't get lost in the system.
Exactly.
He's suffered enough.
When did you first meet Tristan?
Last year. He was in my sophomore biology class.
And did the school make you aware of his background before that?
Namely that he had been physically abused by his parents?
Yes. The district informs us of any difficulties at home so that we may better understand the child.
Did it surprise you when you heard that Tristan was being accused of credit-card theft?
Yes. That's not at all the Tristan I've come to know.
Do you think it's possible that Tristan stole this money to help out someone?
A girlfriend, boyfriend?
I...guess it's possible.
Was there a significant other you ever saw him with then?
No.
Tristan's one of those kids who always just had his head buried in a book.
That's not all his head was buried in.
Do not make jokes right now.
Sorry.
So, what's next?
We go to the D.A., tell him that Tristan's ready to testify against
Susie Sex Ed?
No.
Susan wants to testify tomorrow, so let's have a little fun and make her confess on the stand.
Sounds a little risky, though, no?
What's risky is giving a child abuser time to get a lawyer and deny the whole thing.
She's pregnant with his kid.
I mean, there's no denying it.
And what if she claims he was the aggressor?
You think anyone ever believes the child in situations like this?
Oh, my God, this is about what your dad did?
I'm sorry to even bring it up, but...
But you brought it up anyway.
You stood by while your buddies raped Tiffany Howard.
Does that mean you can't separate your personal feelings from an abuse case, too?
Or is it just me who's the mess here?
No, I -- I didn't mean it that way.
Get your own ride home.
Nate?
Hey.
I heard you were back in the uniform.
Yeah, a while ago.
Surprised I haven't run into you.
I never leave my office.
That's a good way to avoid trouble.
Yeah, well, my life could use a little trouble these days.
I know I shouldn't bring this up, but genius play hitting
Keating with that suspension.
What are you talking about?
Someone sent a tape of her smacking her client to the Disciplinary Board.
Okay, one --
I can't believe no one in the office told me about this.
Two -- she hit her own client?
Yeah.
Good Lord, she's even more far gone than I thought.
- You definitely want to avoid a formal hearing.
They'll enjoy punishing you in public too much.
Better to just make a statement in private, promise to go to anger-management classes.
I'll probably hit people there, too.
I really need to retire.
The Sam insurance money is that good?
I spent it all.
I could sell the house.
Oh, God, yes, do that.
I've lived in here forever.
Yeah, and look what happened.
I'm sorry.
Okay, let's say you retire.
Sell the house, move somewhere quiet --
I hate the quiet.
Then move to a city -- a real city like
New York or Chicago.
What the hell am I gonna do in the city?
Move in with you, become your trophy wife?
I'm down for that.
So, what'd you do with the insurance money?
I hired a hit man to kill Frank.
Are we really doing this?
I hope so.
Hurry.
Just do it.
- How do you even know a hit man?
He wasn't really a hit man.
You just said he was.
Well, I-I just wanted him to find Frank, that's all.
And what was he supposed to do once he found him?
Well, I never got the chance to make that decision.
You made the decision the minute you hired him.
He killed my son.
Maybe not with his own hands, but... in what world do I not make him pay for that?
Tell me.
Come here.
Oh, stop.
No, you stop.
It's okay.
I didn't say to kill him.
I know, I know.
Nate, hi.
Hey.
I didn't know you were in town.
Yeah, I'm at this conference for a few days.
Came over to help with the whole suspension mess.
Right.
Did you find out anything?
Talked to Atwood.
I don't think she's behind it.
Hello?
 Hey, Laurel, it's Meggy.
 Sorry for the cold call.
I-I had to sneak into Wes's phone to get your number.
Is everything okay?
 Totally.
Just I'm thinking about doing something for his birthday, and I wanted to know if you'd help.
Oh, um...hang on, let me just go outside.
It's not hot.
It's rape.
So, you're saying that me hooking up with my camp counselor when
I was 14, that was rape?
If he was over 18, yes.
But I mean, if you ask any guy, most would be willing to give their left nut to sleep with their high school teacher.
Mm-hmm.
Mrs. Alvarez.
It's not the same.
Tristan has a history of abuse, and Susan took advantage of that.
It's not okay.
Thank you.
Bonnie shouldn't be doing this, though, right?
I mean, the plan is insane.
Yeah, seriously. She's trying to be Annalise all of a sudden?
Annalise got suspended for bitch slapping a client.
I'm not sure any of us should want to be her anymore.
Where were you?
The bathroom.
Is that okay with you?
Okay, enough. We get it.
You want to hurt Oliver back.
Look, this might be difficult for all of you straight people to understand, but not all sex is a big deal.
Well, it's always a "big" deal with me.
You're ridiculous, and you've got a problem.
No, I've got game.
Show me your I.D.
I'm a junior.
I told you.
There's no harm in proving it.
You too.
You're quite bossy.
Yeah, just wait.
Satisfied?
Not yet.
That's your job.
Ooh, what about sexy Bernardo?
He's kind of out of my league.
Ah! So, that's a yes.
Mmm, Jason.
He says he's "dom masc BB."
What does BB stand for?
Big balls?
Oh, my -- no.
Seriously.
Look, I found who e-mailed the slap.
Ooh, who sent it?
Barry Lewiston.
- Barry Lewiston, a board member of this university, was the one who e-mailed the video of me to get my license suspended.
Before we jump to any conclusions, know that this is the first
I'm hearing about any --
I don't believe you.
Then don't, but if what you're saying is true --
I have proof that it's true.
Fine.
But don't pretend this comes as a surprise.
You took on a multi-million-dollar corporation.
Did you really think they were gonna fight fair?
So what, are you condoning this?
I'm saying your behavior on this campus has been inappropriate, unprofessional --
At least I haven't acted illegally, unlike your board.
Until now.
What does that mean?
How's your clinic still running if your license has been suspended?
My client is a 15-year-old foster child.
You want us to abandon him mid-trial?
I want you to abide by the conditions of your employment.
Just like every other professor on this campus.
How many of those professors have their faces printed on inflammatory fliers?
And where are you in that investigation, anyway?
Or is Barry Lewiston behind those, too?
Annalise -- You people want a fight, I'll fight.
Listen. You forget that my ability for kicking ass is precisely why you hired me.
Shut up, Annalise!
You come in here yelling at me, your boss, and you think that's gonna get you what you want?
It won't.
So let me put this simply for you.
There's a saying where I come from -- whoever can't hear must feel.
So do it.
Make me feel.
Somebody already did.
And now you've lost your license to practice.
Hurts, doesn't it?
You can't fire me because of this.
Check your contract.
Without a license, your tenure gets nullified.
Next time you want to meet, make an appointment with my assistant.
 It's Frank.
 Leave a message.
Hey, I saw your dad yesterday.
He told me you went to jail once.
But I guess I shouldn't be surprised by that at this point.
Hey.
Hey, um...
Everything okay?
Why do I feel like
I'm being interrogated by you all the time?
I'm not interrogating you.
I just want to know what's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
Then why are you being so defensive?
Look, if you don't want to tell me, that's fine, but I just want to be there for you.
Meggy's throwing you a surprise party tonight.
I'm sorry, I ruined it.
Or maybe it's better.
Like, you hate your birthday or you think surprise parties are horrible.
No, just no one's ever thrown me a birthday party before.
Don't worry.
I will...play along.
Are you about to start sweating again?
Yeah, you know me.
-We ready?
-Yeah.
Hey.
Is Annalise onboard with this?
God, you don't know when to quit.
What you're about to do to that kid is cruel.
What's cruel is you doubting me when I need to go destroy a witness, so shut up, sit down at that table, and support your boss.
Kind of early for that.
Not after the week
I've been having.
You're already back from work?
Yeah.
We should talk.
You sleeping with Eve?
Would it bother you if I were?
Screw who you want, but don't have me living up in here --
It was your choice to move in.
'Cause you thought Frank was gonna put a bullet in your head.
So get out.
I'd rather be alone.
You're an alcoholic.
Of course I am.
And that's not just the vodka talking.
That's the me
I've always been.
And unfortunately, you're the same you -- so patient, so accommodating.
Not used to that in a man?
That's a problem for you?
No, the problem is you're a little bitch!
That surprise you, huh?
You want to hit me?
Go ahead, hit me.
Hit me!
Hit me!
You're a cancer.
Oh, that's all you got?
That's why Sam cheated.
Even Frank ran off.
You're cowards, all of you.
Who are you gonna ruin next, Eve?
Eve's got more balls than all of you!
Eve don't know you.
 You don't know me.
You're gonna die alone in this house.
That's what I know, and no one's gonna give a rat's ass.
Not me, not Eve, not even your damn mother once she realizes how sick you really are.
You're still standing here.
Get help.
- Your first witness,
Ms. Winterbottom.
I'd like to call my client's biology teacher, Susan Boatman, to the stand.
Wow, she really does think she's Annalise.
Ms. Boatman, do you have any idea why Tristan would steal these credit cards?
I don't.
Do you think his history of abuse perhaps had something to do with it?
I wouldn't know.
Are you sure?
I guess I don't really understand the question.
Okay.
Maybe you can answer this question.
Are you pregnant?
I'm sorry?
Right now sitting on that stand, are you pregnant?
What is she doing?
Ms. Winterbottom, how is this relevant to the case?
Relevance will become clear once Ms. Boatman here admits to the identity of her unborn child's father.
Objection. Counsel's giving her own testimony.
Is Tristan the father of the baby, Susan?
Please stop her.
Did Tristan tell you this?
He's lying.
Is he lying?
Or are you?
Answer me.
Ms. Boatman, I should caution you that you may plead the fifth in order to avoid incriminating yourself.
Incriminate myself from what?
You raped my client,
Susan.
You knew he was vulnerable and trustworthy, so you targeted him.
Don't look at him.
He's suffered enough under your care, and now you're going to fix that by admitting what you did -- how you raped this boy...
Please tell her to stop.
I'm begging you.
...manipulated him to the point that he stole money for your unborn child.
Tell the court the truth, Susan!
I plead the fifth.
The prosecution's dropping the charges against you.
They understand now that you were acting on behalf of an adult.
But Susan will go to jail?
Well, she deserves more than jail for what she did to you,
Tristan.
Someday, you're going to understand --
 You don't understand!
This isn't about her!
It's about the baby!
She's gonna have it in jail, and then what?
Who's gonna take care of it?
No one.
It's gonna grow up just like me -- with no family.
You're both horrible people.
Blame me.
None of this is on you.
No, I -- I don't blame you.
I'm proud of you.
He needed to see the person she really is.
Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me.
I just wanted to go on record as soon as possible.
We understand.
As long as you know any statement you make here can be used as evidence at the formal disciplinary hearing.
I do.
When you're ready.
My name is Annalise Keating, and I've been a member of the Pennsylvania Bar for 18 years.
In light of the video of me assaulting my client,
I felt that it was important for me to open up about a personal struggle
I've recently been facing.
I'm an alcoholic.
I'm not here to make excuses or to ask for forgiveness.
You don't know how long I've been wanting this to happen.
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Show me.
It's no surprise that
I've had many struggles in my personal life of late.
My husband's death, the shooting, the fliers.
My professional reputation has suffered.
I've begun to self-medicate with alcohol as a result.
Connor.
Sorry, there are a lot of guys in this building.
Half of whom you'll probably bang by the end of the night.
Shh.
- Surprise!
Oh, my God!
- Happy birthday!
Getting his dance on.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!
-Wow. That was...
Thank you very much.
- Aww.
- I'm ashamed and embarrassed by my behavior.
It does not reflect the person that I am either as a lawyer or woman.
As such, I agreed to enter an approved treatment program if it will allow me to get my license reinstated.
It's perfect. Alcoholism is a medical condition.
You're under a protected class.
You're a genius.
Oh, it was Nate's idea.
Well, then
Nate's a genius.
Yeah.
Thank you.
For what?
For not judging me.
I'd never judge you.
You're the only one.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I met someone.
Vanessa.
She's the one I was talking to on the phone the other night.
We met a few months ago during my case in California.
Things have been moving faster than I expected.
I wasn't sure if it was gonna be anything real, and, you know, with everything that's going on with you, it just...
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.
What were you talking about?
On the phone, you seemed upset.
She wants me to move to San Francisco.
Does she love you?
Yes.
You love her?
I do.
You should go.
Annalise.
No. Oh, no.
You deserve it more than anyone.
Go.
Let yourself be loved.
- You are not what I was expecting.
-What does that mean?
-Meggy!
I mean, that name is just --
You were expecting me to be an annoying white girl.
It's cool. I've been dealing with that my entire life.
Right? Like, what were your parents thinking?
All right, yeah, let's burn some of that
Henny off on the dance floor. Okay.
Like, was she really...
You know what, come on, you too.
Oh, no thanks.
Hey. I threw you this stupid party.
The very least you can do is come over here and dance with me for one song.
-Really?
-Yes.
Hey, um, are you hooking up with Simon?
I don't care if you are.
I just --
No. I'm not hooking up with anyone.
That's just you and the entire city of Philadelphia.
Okay, I'm confused.
You're on Humpr, too.
Michaela's on my Humpr.
So, then you're not mad at me?
It's not that simple.
Because I'm willing to stop sleeping around if you want to get back together.
Is that it?
Changed your mind?
Great.
Then we can both screw our brains out.
It's not as easy for me to hook up as it is for you.
Oh, my God, you need to get over this whole low self-esteem thing.
I mean, you're -- you're hot, funny, your penis is practically perfect.
None of that matters if you're positive.
You know what you're gonna say.
There's condoms and prep and I shouldn't let it bother me, but it's still a deal breaker for most guys.
Stupid guys.
Oh, yeah?
So, if I told you I was positive the first night we met, you still would've gone home with me?
Look, you hook up as much as you want.
Just maybe don't rub it in my face.
Yeah.
I'll stop.
I'm willing to rub other things in your face any time you want, though.
- Shut up.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
No, it's...
Sure.
I'm gonna need for you to make a real food run -- chips, dip, anything with chocolate.
What's wrong?
My father's dead.
I thought he was still at the federal prison in Allentown.
That's where he's been since the trial.
Maybe the computer will change its mind the next time.
Name's Kevin. I'm new.
- But I guess he was having lung problems.
-We really doing this?
-I hope so.
Hurry.
Just do it.
So, they moved him to a low-security prison with a hospital.
Why they care about keeping pedophiles alive is beyond me.
Who are you?
Frank.
It's nice to finally meet you, Bob.
There's no need for that.
Just relax.
Take deep breaths.
- He listed me as his next of kin, so the nurse called me and asked me if I wanted to pick up my father's body.
Where's the prison?
Coalport.
It's a few hours from Pittsburgh.
Hydrogen sulfide.
It's gonna melt your lungs from inside out, and it's gonna hurt real bad.
Like the worst pain of your life.
And still it won't make up for what you did to her.
Enjoy hell, Bob.
I'm so sorry.
For what?
I lied.
My father found Frank.
He's in Coalport, Bonnie.
I know I should've told you, but Frank called me when I was in Florida, and he said Annalise was trying to kill him, and I know he could be lying, but I didn't know whether
I should believe him.
He killed your father, didn't he?
Don't tell Annalise.
- Please, I work in the law office where they were found.
- Then you know it's against the law for me to tell you anything.
They could be one of my friends, or worse.
Oliver!
Thank God you're here.
The nurse won't tell me anything, but maybe if you talked to...
Meggy. Meggy!
Hey, Meggy!
- Call down to plastics, see where the attending is, and get me the results of the post-intubation blood gases.
Dr. Lowell?
E.T. tube looks good.
-Dr. Lowell!
-What?
I'm a med student. I was sent to get the lab results.
-Get to the point.
-She's pregnant.
Oh, my God.
I know her.
- Congratulations.

 Previously on "How to Get Away
 with Murder"...
We immediately suspend your license.
You can't fire me because of this.
Without a license, your tenure gets nullified.
You're an alcoholic.
No, the problem is you're a little bitch!
Get help.
My name is Annalise Keating, and I'm an alcoholic.
Nate?
You don't know how long
I've been wanting this to happen.
My father's dead.
I lied.
My father found Frank.
He's in Coalport.
He killed your father.
Don't tell Annalise.
Dr. Lowell!
She's pregnant.
Oh, my God.
I know her. sign of hydrops
Good.
And what's taking the O.B. so long?
Page down to plastics.
We need to debride these burns.
Do they not know that?
There is some concern with smoke inhalation.
Uh. What does that mean?
Is she gonna die?
Okay, you need to keep your voice down, okay?
I could get in a lot of trouble for even telling you this.
I just want to make sure she's okay.
I'm sorry.
I know, and I promise you,
I'm gonna tell you everything I can, okay?
H-Have you thought about contacting the others?
No. What am I --
I wanted to make sure we had more information...
Hi.
I'm here.
Just don't worry.
I know. I'm on it.
Please try to trust me.
Laurel's pregnant.
We're happy to plan whatever you like.
The funeral, flowers, any burial services.
That won't be necessary.
Do you need a moment?
No.
Cremate him.
Of course.
Just are you in town for a bit?
You could pick up the ashes, or we could mail them.
Can anyone see you calling me right now?
No, I'm in my car.
Where are you?
Leaving the funeral home.
Oh. How was it?
Lovely.
Stupid question.
Sorry.
Have you seen Frank?
No.
You'll call me when you do?
 If I do.
I'll call you later.
Thank you.
So, Meggy wants to have a buttload of your babies, basically?
- No.
Mm. You better start saving for a ring.
Personally, I think anything under three karats is a red flag.
What are you guys talking about?
Waitlist is meeting Meggy's parents tonight.
Her father's in town.
We're just having dinner.
Oh, that's a big deal.
-It's not.
-It is.
And you need to dump her before this goes bad.
Meggy's amazing.
Why would he break up with her?
None of us at this table are fit to date civilians.
That's ridiculous.
No, what's ridiculous is you dating doughnut-hole here when the only thing you guys have in common is murder.
Can we not talk about this right here?
Maybe I should date
Waitlist.
Or Laurel.
Or we could be a throuple.
I mean, that makes just about as much sense as you two boning.
Actually, technically, my hotness and I are not boning right now.
I'm pulling a "Bull Durham" until the arbitration exam's over.
Hey, guys,
I got a trade opportunity.
Dumbass Gavin over there hasn't even started the evidence outline.
Any of you be willing to trade for my arbitration outline?
Uh...yeah.
I'm doing our evidence outline.
I can get it to you by Monday
Great.
Did you actually do the reading for evidence?
No, and I didn't for this exam either, so I'm just gonna --
Oh, my God.
What is that?
Uh... it's a xeroxed ass.
My ass!
Does that turn you on, Walsh?
This is sexual harassment.
Why don't you go tattletale to Mommy then?
Oh, that's right.
She's still suspended.
But your assistant called and canceled.
I'm so over her.
That's the third time she canceled at the last minute.
I told her not to come back.
I ain't trying to deal with anyone.
Hey, Camila, I get it.
That's right.
It's because of your mouth.
What my mouth got to do with anything?
You've got a loud mouth.
Don't be dealing with that all the time.
That's true.
Miss Annalise, can I get you some champagne?
She's a little lost in her own world today.
Ain't that right, Annalise?
I'm sorry.
Yvonne asked you if you wanted something to drink.
You look like you need it.
We got champagne.
Cheap champagne.
I do not recommend it.
I'm trying to cut back.
Why?
You pregnant?
Oh, please. My eggs dried up a long time ago.
Then you can't use your period as an excuse for this mood you in.
What's wrong? You finally screw up with the cop?
Since when has my mood been dependent on a man?
Ooh, does that mean you done with him?
There she go.
Queen of THOT-land.
Y'all know my radar perks up when the conversation turns to fine-ass sexy men.
If you're talking about that same guy that you showed me in that picture one day, then I want first dibs.
I got him next.
Ooh, honey, I would love to take them --
You'd love to what?
Be with a man who don't cry after sex.
You know what? That's why
I don't tell you nothing, Ro.
Wait. You want to know what your problem is, Professor?
You're too greedy.
First you're not happy with the white man, now you're not happy with the black man.
Better than being sloppy like some people I know, sleeping with their husband's friends.
But see, it worked, didn't it?
I found out Tyler was screwing our neighbor.
Heffa, everyone knew your husband was sleeping with the neighbor.
Well, how come no one told me?
We did!
We did!                  We did!
See, that's messed up.
What's up, ladies?
Oh, no! Gone, gone!
You know the rules. Out!
We don't want your stuff.
I told his druggy behind not to come in here anymore.
Y'all know he harmless.
He just down on his luck.
For the last 10 years?
Well, it took me 14 to get my ass clean.
Clean from what?
Oh, Ro didn't tell you about her crack-den days?
It was cocaine mostly.
Rick wasn't playing when he said it was a hell of a drug.
But I did the work, used God and sex to make me feel good, throw some AA meetings in there, and I'm good to go.
She still drinks.
It was that one time.
If you mean by "one time" every Tuesday and Thursday down at Jazzy C's...
Why'd you do it?
Which part?
You think this is funny?
Annalise would kill me if she knew I was here, Frank.
Mm, take a number.
She's probably got another hit man on his way here right now.
I don't blame her for that.
You shot Mahoney while Wes was standing right there.
Why?
What? You didn't?
Somebody else just happened to shoot him?
It was me.
Why take Wes?
I needed to know she wasn't gonna come after me.
You made him a suspect.
That is why she came after you.
Maybe Sam was wrong about me.
Don't say that.
None of this would've ever happened if they just left me in there.
Get up.
Why?
'Cause we're gonna beat your ass.
Kidding.
You got a visitor.
Who the hell are you?
Dr. Keating.
Sit.
Your Aunt Bev knows my sister
Hannah from high school.
She was saying how worried your family is, that nobody's heard from you.
You don't want them to visit?
I'm in solitary.
Yeah, but that was before.
You haven't spoken to your parents in -- what -- a few months?
Okay, look, I've worked with a lot of people in your similar situation.
Sociopaths?
You've been incarcerated since you were 13, Frank.
There's tons of research to show how that impacts family dynamics.
Good to know.
Truth?
Your parents told me you were up for parole.
And they want to do whatever they can to get you out of here.
I even have a lawyer for a wife who I believe can win your case.
And I can see it in you, too.
Frank -- you want out of here.
Let me help get you there.
Threatening a guard, assaulting an inmate, and that's on top of attempted murder?
Here's what I think.
You need to say "No" to your sister for once in your life.
So...I take it that's a no?
Well, if you want me to take a case pro bono, how about not a white boy who has violent tendencies?
What?
Well, how is this different than you asking me to help Bonnie?
Bonnie didn't try to kill her father.
She might've if we hadn't helped her.
That's a reach.
Just -- Just hear me out.
He's poor, and his family's hurting.
What's the harm in just going to see him?
Don't get up.
Before we start, let me be blunt.
The only way I see you getting out is if you admit guilt.
I don't care if it's not true, if it was an accident.
You got to say you did it on purpose.
Do I need to repeat myself?
No, it's just you're not what I expected.
What does that mean?
Your husband's kind of vanilla.
And...?
You seem the opposite of vanilla.
Neither of us are vanilla.
-You guys got kids?
-Trying.
What's the problem?
His junk not work?
Sexual advance on a female guard, inciting a fight in your cellblock.
Only a moron commits these kinds of infractions when you're up for parole.
Or you just don't want out at all?
Which is it?
I've always been kind of a moron.
Don't worry.
I'm not looking.
Your phone rang.
Laurel?
No.
You sure you don't want the ashes?
I mean, we can cook them into slop, feed it to pigs, or just spread them in the worst place imaginable.
My sister might actually take them.
Oh, so your sister showed up?
Yeah, she's here now.
Oh, then go.
I'll talk to you later.
It's fine.
-How are you?
-Great.
I have the whole house to myself this weekend.
I'm gonna eat and watch bad movies.
You still have the list of AA meetings
I left on your desk?
Bonnie, just go and be with your sister.
Thanks.
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things
I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.
Hi, I'm Jonathan.
I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Jonathan.
Any visitors here for the first time today?
Hi.
We usually start by saying our names.
Do I have to?
Annalise.
Hi, Annalise.
Thank you for joining us today, Annalise.
"Once Middleton was made aware of the circumstances, the office of the President immediately began a review.
As a result, Professor Keating's duties have been reassigned.
A new instructor has been assigned to the Legal Clinic effective immediately."
Ding-dong, the bitch is dead.
Can they do this?
Of course.
She pushed too far.
Or they couldn't handle having a strong woman in power.
Power only works if you know how to not abuse it.
Okay, we need to storm the President's office, do an "Oh, Captain!
My Captain!"
Maybe this just means we're finally free.
Free of what?
Her.
This is bad, isn't it?
She'll figure something out.
She always does.
I-I could be out of a job, and I really like this job.
Poor Annalise.
Had to figure I'd run into someone I know at one of these sooner or later.
Professor Erickson?
You think he could do a better job than me?
I don't think this is the place to discuss this.
I don't care what you think.
I'm at this meeting in order to get my license back.
Is that the only reason you're here?
I'll sue you.
Remind your board of that.
You think there's a chance in hell they would've suspended you if they thought you had a legitimate case?
Unbelievable.
You know what?
Stop fighting, Annalise.
It's not cute anymore.
Come home with me.
What?
She needs to hear you say it -- that Sam forced you to keep it from her.
I could've told her, anyway.
You couldn't...
...because Sam got into your head... just like he did to me.
This is a woman who wants me dead.
Because she blames you for the baby, and that's fair.
You know that.
Of course I do.
Then come home and tell her that.
She'll forgive you.
You just need to forgive her first.
He was lying to me in there.
Why? That's your job to figure out, but plenty of people prefer a life on the inside.
Someone feeds you, tells you where to be all the time.
Sounds nice to me.
Doesn't make any sense, though.
And yet, that's what he's doing.
Commits crimes in jail so he doesn't have to deal with the real world.
My job is hard enough dealing with people who actually want to be out.
He wants out.
He's just... confused.
Come on, tell me you didn't see what I saw -- the wounded --
I think you saw a boy in need of a daddy.
That's not fair.
Well, neither is guilting me into being a mother.
That's not what this is about.
Everything coming out of your mouth right now is about that.
You're reaching, and you know it.
When's the last time you touched me?
Ever since I said no to IVF,
I'm not enough for you -- is that it?
Annie --
You can't stand the idea of being stuck all alone in this house with me.
Okay, hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Come here.
Come here.
You're all I need.
And if I haven't made you feel that way...
I'm sorry.
You... are enough for me.
Look what I found in the basement.
One of my dad's hiding spots, clearly.
I'm not drinking that.
You want to toast our first night here with water?
Aw!
Oh, my God, that's the foulest thing I've ever tasted.
Never again.
Come here.
Hey, you still up to get dinner with Dean Foster on Friday?
I'll call the doctor.
Everyone's gonna hate us.
Two Professor Keatings on one campus.
The new power couple.
They only hired me as assistant professor.
Well, for now.
You'll get tenure in record time, way before me.
Like that was ever a question.
Wow, someone's getting cocky pretty fast.
Yeah, you love it.
Mm.
Where is it?
What are you talking about?
One of you took my laptop.
Give it back.
-Ooh, this is good.
-This isn't funny!
Unwad your panties, bro.
I went to the bathroom.
It was right there.
I came back, and it was gone, and I will call security if I have to.
-I dare you.
-Ain't afraid of no po-po.
Okay, open your bag then and prove you don't have it.
Hey!
It is illegal to do an unlawful search and seizure of someone's belongings.
This isn't funny.
That computer was expensive and I don't have money to blow like the rest of your spoiled asses.
-Spoiled?
-Oh, you think we don't know that you're just here playing at law school until you can swap a rich daddy for a rich husband?
Go anywhere near my bag or anyone else's in this room and your laptop won't be all you're missing, you spineless, tiny-balled, whiny excuse of a man!
Walk away.
So, Wes, where you from?
Ohio originally, but I, uh,
I moved around a lot.
Oh. Army brat?
Uh, Dad, can you just let him eat?
This is not an interrogation.
All right, maybe just a little bit.
I get it.
But, no, not an Army brat.
So, what do your parents do?
Dad.
How is that not a fair question?
Wes' mom died of cancer and he never met his father.
I apologize.
It was a really long time ago.
What kind of cancer?
Oh, my God.
I'm just trying to bond with the boy, Meggy.
It's okay. Stomach.
Brutal.
Yeah.
You reached Nate Lahey.
 Leave a message.
I knew you weren't gonna pick up.
But I was calling to say you're lucky I sent you away because now you don't have to deal with this mess anymore, and I got a lot of it.
Like I need to tell you.
Um.
You can thank me next time you see me.
You up?
Yeah.
I can't go back.
Even if she says she'll forgive me, she can't.
And maybe
I don't have to go back.
Maybe neither of us do.
Run away with me.
You're not happy in that house.
Nobody ever is.
But you...out of all of us deserve to be.
Find some boring town.
Get normal jobs.
Make a family.
We'd have cute babies, no?
I'm only teasing.
You mind if I turn on the TV?
Go ahead.
Everything 
 you know, life escalates.
 But when you're young,
love, life is very complicated.
My wife's a hard sell,
Frank, but her bull detector's pretty good.
But I think I can get her back to your side.
Yeah, you did your best.
Don't worry about it.
I do worry, though.
You're scared to get out.
No, that's stupid.
Then why do you keep screwing up in here?
Because the only reason
I can think of is that you can't forgive yourself for what you did.
It was an accident, Frank.
My parents tell you that?
"No way he could've pulled that lever himself."
He took the TV out of my room... yelled at me when I didn't help out around the house, as a dad should do.
And still, I thought it was worth killing the guy over.
You were 13.
You didn't know what you were doing.
I planned it for weeks.
Waited for the perfect moment.
Looked forward to it.
And when it was over and he was under that car, screaming like an animal in a trap, my only thought was,
"You idiot, Frank.
You couldn't even kill him right."
Now tell me
I should get out of here.
You should.
Then you're even more of a sociopath than I am.
Sociopaths don't cry over what they did, Frank.
Hey.
You have good in you. Okay?
Just like all of us.
And I'm here to finally help you see that.
You have good in you.
Wake up.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Your dad?
How about Oregon?
They have these beach towns with giant sand dunes and trees, and it rains a lot, too, so we won't feel bad if we stay inside all the time.
And when it's nice, we can go for hikes.
Can't imagine you on a hike.
That's the point.
We'd do things that make us forget.
...but the 4th Circuit's opinion found
Rule 17-A applies to only those asserting a claim, that people can sue whoever they want, so why did the Supreme Court find in favor of the respondent in Vaden v. Discover Bank?
Castillo.
What was the question?
Ms. Vaden failed to disprove the presumption that she received a binding arbitration clause in the mail, and therefore agreed to the contract.
Now say it with a Southern twang.
What are you talking about?
Your hillbilly came out when you were bitching out Simon.
It did not.
It did.
It was pretty thick.
It happens in sex sometimes, too, P.S.
So, I can never quite put my finger on it.
It's like a cross between, like,
Louisiana alligator wrestling and Georgian peach picker.
We just broke up.
Hey, come on.
Come on.
Come on in. Ooh.
Dance with me, Wes.
Ooh!
Ooh! Mm-mm-mm.
I'm just fooling around with you.
Mm.
What's wrong?
I thought you weren't supposed to be drinking.
Oh.
There's a lot of things
I'm not supposed to be doing.
Hey!
This is my song!
 ...lucky I sent you away
 because now you don't have
to deal with this mess anymore,
 and I got a lot of it.
Everything okay?
 Like I need to tell you.
Family drama.
I know how that goes.
Oh.
Every woman in my office would stone me if they found where I was right now.
You can't tell anyone about us.
Oh, we are consenting adults, Nate.
I'm serious.
Didn't turn out so well last time I slept with a lawyer.
Oh, let's be clear --
I'm no Annalise Keating.
You heard that woman's calling herself an alcoholic now, right?
That's how she's getting out of her suspension.
It'll probably work, too.
That's how life rolls for that woman.
The lady's got nine lives.
You got to see this.
What are you doing here?
I asked Oliver for a favor.
What kind of favor?
I hacked Simon's laptop.
You stole his computer?
Nope, that was me.
Michaela.
You're insane.
Who are you? Seriously.
You some sort of hillbilly klepto all of a sudden?
Okay, you're all gonna be happy
I did this when we get his arbitration outline.
Couldn't find the outline.
Check again.
I found something better.
Oh, my God.
What the --
I knew it.
Here.
Here.
Listen.
So much for that 100% Indian hair.
Go!
Go away.
Go away!
Just --
No.
I'm dis-- I'm disgusting!
I'm disgusting.
No. Here.
You shot me.
You wanted me dead.
I saw it in your eyes.
You hate me.
You hate me.
That's not true.
You protect me.
And I just want to do the same for you.
Ohh.
How's -- How's Meggy?
Huh? Huh?
Is she good to you?
Very.
Oh.
Too good?
'Cause Nate's too good to me.
I tried to be okay with it.
I really did.
I really did.
No.
You need some water?
Parole cases are time-consuming and tedious, but my husband seems to like you for some reason, and I tend to think that my husband has good taste.
He picked me, after all.
So, if I help you, you can't lie to me again.
Understood?
Yeah.
Okay, you got yourself a lawyer.
Now, we need to go over the details of what happened to your father, all right?
I got the police report right here.
I need to...
You okay?
You need to tell me your side of the story.
Spare no details.
You pregnant or something?
Boy, right?
How'd you know?
Don't marry a lawyer.
Take him!
I just had a feeling it was him.
He's always so aggro about you and that he's never gotten to be first chair, and -- and with your job on the line,
I just thought maybe I should just look through his computer.
She stole his computer for the arbitration outline.
We can't give it to the university, though, right?
Otherwise they'll know that Michaela stole it.
I can lie, say I found it somewhere in the quad.
No one's ever gonna believe that.
No one has to lie.
I'm not gonna show it to anyone.
You're just gonna let him get away with this?
I didn't say that.
Go and prep for your exam.
What are you gonna do?
Make that weenball pay.
Honestly, you sure?
Yeah.
I mean, the D.A.'s office could've put these up or anyone who knows what we've done, but it wasn't any of them.
It was just some sad, pathetic lost boy.
We're safe.
We're still safe.
Mind if I come in?
What's going on?
Stop!
What are you doing here?
I came to return this.
Somebody put that there, planted it.
Don't lie to me!
Slander, defamation, hate crime if you want to bring race into it, and it all leads to your expulsion or worse -- prison!
What are you gonna do?
That's up to you.
Mr. Gibbins, give us an example of procedural versus substantive unconscionability.
Uh...it was unconscionable 'cause --
Wrong. Mr. Millstone?
I object, Your Honor.
I object to the question,
I object to your tone, and I object that we don't have a cool pitcher of sweet, home-brewed lemonade to get us through these proceedings.
Are you done?
Do you think it's more of, like, a -- like a BeyoncÃ© Southern or a "Deliverance" Southern?
We have an exam tomorrow.
Come on, just tell us where your accent's from.
Is it your birth parents or adopted parents?
It's none of your business.
Uh, we're boning.
I think it's my business.
The people who raised me are trash.
I am who I am not because of them but in spite of them.
They are not worth my breath or time, especially when we have an exam, so let's never speak of them again or I'll cut you all into little pieces.
Hey.
It's the arbitration outline.
We good now?
What the hell just happened?
I don't know.
Does it matter?
I'm gonna go make copies.
What's wrong?
I need to break up with Meggy.
Dinner with her dad went that well?
I'm sick of lying to her.
Think I should stay with her?
No. Do what you want.
We're all so messed up.
Annalise, especially.
But you...
I'll break up with Meggy.
Frank's gone.
Frank isn't gone.
Frank?
Hi.
I wanted you and your board to have a chance to review my lawsuit before I file.
Retaliation by the university for speaking my mind, gender, race, age discrimination, a hostile work environment, wanton breach of contract, neglect.
Neglect?
The fliers.
It's been weeks, and your investigation has found nothing.
Instead, you've devoted university resources to having me disbarred, the legality of which is questionable in its own right.
$50 million?
Go big or go home.
What do you want?
A truce.
Reverse my suspension.
I go back to teaching the clinic.
You still don't have your license --
That's being taken care of.
Because you went to one AA meeting?
This is not up for negotiation.
Either give me what I want or wake up tomorrow to a lawsuit that will color the entirety of your short run as university president.
Fine, I'll make the calls right now.
Thank you.
Annalise.
How are you? Really.
You can't get better alone.
Believe me, I've tried... and failed enough times to know.
Make those calls.
Stop, please.
At least let me warn Bonnie.
Bonnie lied.
Fine, then you tell her.
I just -- I can't.
Oh, I'm not in the mood to see your needy faces.
Laurel needs to tell you something.
She can't speak for herself?
That's not the Laurel I know, letting a man speak for her.
Please just listen.
All right.
Fine. What?
Say something.
It's about Frank.
What?
He's in Coalport with Bonnie.
He called me when I was with my dad, and he told me that you tried to kill him.
Is it true? Did you?
Is that true?
Can you tell us the truth for once?
Laurel.
I'm here.
I know. I'm on it.
Please try to trust me.
Laurel's pregnant.
I had no idea.
Just stay here, okay?
I promise
I'll keep you updated.
I'll be right back.
Okay.
Pick up.
Please pick up.
Please pick up, please pick up, please pick up.
This is Connor.
 You should text me.
Connor, pick up, please.
Please pick --
- Hello?
Who's this?
 Trishelle. Who's this?
Oliver. Were --
I'm looking for Connor Walsh.
Is that whose phone this is?
I just found it in my daughter's sofa cushions.
Darn thing was vibrating my booty.
Mom!
Someone named Oliver looking for Connor.
I don't know where he is,
Oliver.
Are you sure?
 Yeah, what's wrong?
 You haven't heard?
Heard what?
 Annalise's house burned down.
 The cops arrested her.
 Laurel was inside,
 but they found her.
What?
 She's pregnant, Michaela.
 Laurel.
Did she tell you?
Congratulations.
You've each been chosen for my very first criminal-law clinic.
In here, you're not just students but actual practicing lawyers.
You finally get to be me.
 Thursdays on ABC...
At least they chose a good photo.
...brace yourself for a mystery
 so killer...
This could destroy us all.
 ...not everyone is gonna
 make it out alive.
No!
 "How To Get Away With Murder."
 Thursdays, 10:00, 9:00 Central
 on ABC.

What are you looking for?
It's right here.
Well, damn.
 13 seasons
 of fun.
Gimme, gimme, gimme.
 13 seasons of drama.
This act was a felony.
It was nice knowing you.
Shut up.
 13 seasons of twisty turns...
It's bad.
You're falling for me.
I slept with him.
 ...like only "Grey's"
 can deliver.
Damn right.

 Thursdays on ABC.

Previously on "How To Get Away
With Murder"...
-I think I'm your son.
-Why would you think that?
You were just asking for directions?
Yeah.
A violation of this nature demands we immediately suspend your license.
Nate?
You don't know how long I've been wanting this to happen.
-What's going on?
-I came to return this.
I wanted you and your board to have a chance to review my lawsuit.
Wanton breach of contract, neglect.
Neglect?
The fliers.
Reverse my suspension.
I go back to teaching the clinic.
I'm sick of lying to her.
I'll break up with Meggy.
Frank's gone.
Frank isn't gone.
Frank?
It's about Frank.
What?
He's in Coalport with Bonnie.
Laurel?
I'm looking for Connor Walsh.
Is that whose phone this is?
Mom!
Yeah, what's wrong?
Annalise's house burned down.
Laurel was inside, but they found her.
Officials have confirmed one fatality and one victim said to be in critical condition at...
Hi.
You've reached Asher Millstone, and your message to me matters.
Asher, call me back the second you get this.
Police and firefighting crews...
Hey, baby.
How can I help?
-You can't.
-Well, where are you going?
-It doesn't matter.
-Let me go with you.
No, just stay here.
You're in shock.
I've been through worse.
Just sit here.
One fatality was reported at the scene.
And don't steal anything.
Another victim is in critical condition at Middleton Hospital.
But the identity of that victim has not been released to the public.
He would have known if I was lying to him.
So you lied to me instead.
It worked.
Did Frank finally spread your legs?
Because that's the only reason
I can come up with for you acting this stupid.
Listen to me.
Or do you miss Sam so much that you threw yourself at the next most disgusting man in this house?
I went there for this.
You shot Mahoney while
Wes was standing right there.
Why?
What, you didn't?
Somebody else just happened to shoot him?
It was me.
Why take Wes?
I needed to know she wasn't gonna come after me.
We can't use that.
It's a confession!
You think we can take this to the police?
That Frank won't tell them everything that we've done? Sam?
Don't blame this on Wes.
You brought this on yourself.
How?
Laurel.
You tried to kill Frank.
You're a dumbass if you believe that.
So you didn't hire a hitman?
I didn't.
Well, Frank's trying to frame me for this.
Maybe someone should kill him.
You don't know what you're talking about.
-Don't you dare go after him.
-I did this for you, Annalise.
No, you did it for yourself, to get the love that no one ever gave you.
But guess who did.
Me.
And you spit it right back in my face.
If I had wanted to betray you,
I wouldn't have come back.
Why is Meggy calling me?
I wish you hadn't because I can handle the men making a fool out of me.
But you?
Annalise, please.
Annalise.
After everything that I've done for you.
Annalise.
What?
The police are at my apartment.
I came to meet Wes, but they were standing at his door.
Are they still there?
Yeah.
They're from New York, and they're investigating a -- a shooting that Wes was a witness to.
What do we tell them?
Just tell them the truth -- that you don't know where he is.
I thought that you guys were all studying together.
The library.
Yeah.
He went to the library.
He, uh, probably turned his phone off.
You know him.
Laurel, this is crazy.
I mean, Wes never told me about any of this.
Miss?
Is that him?
No, it's his friend.
Just tell them that you think he went to the library.
Okay.
Meggy?
Yeah?
Don't worry, okay?
It's all gonna be fine.
I'm sure he's gonna be --
We don't know that it's gonna be fine.
I should just go talk to them.
Do not move.
This is Frank.
He gave the police your name to make you a suspect.
No. He --
Stop defending him!
He thinks that we're gonna tell the police he killed Mahoney.
This is his way of hitting back.
Take Wes' phone, lose it at the library, and you don't leave this house until I say so.
Give it to me.
No.
I'm just gonna talk to them.
You take another step, and I'll chain you in the basement like Rebecca.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Can the bumpkins down home shake it like this?
I ask you for one thing, and you can't even respect that?
Ah, come on.
Look, I get you not wanting to talk about your family in front of everyone else, but I'm your boo.
You're my what?
Your bae, your B.F.,
A-one since Day-one.
Says who?
Um, I sleep here every night when I'm not on duty in the dorm.
'Cause you're too lazy to go home after sex.
You still think
I'm a meat stick.
Can we not do this the night before an exam?
No.
Either admit that what we're doing is more than sex, or I leave right now for good.
Is there a square dance going on?
Is Michaela finally teaching us how to do-si-do?
Okay.
You don't get to mock me while wearing my robe.
And you don't get to avoid this conversation right now.
What conversation?
I need to study.
Everyone out.
We're done.
I'll spoon you, buddy.
You two just break up?
I stopped and asked this guy for directions, and he just...got shot.
While you were talking to him?
Yeah.
Why didn't you ever tell me about this?
It's not the type of thing you bring up when you want a girl to like you.
Maybe not at first, but we tell each other everything.
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.
Meggy, rounds.
Go.
No.
I can ask for the day off.
I'm with Annalise.
She knows what to do.
I'll call you later, okay?
Good job.
Are you at least having Eve look into this?
She couldn't find out anything.
Can Nate?
We're not gonna ask him to clean up our mess anymore.
I'm on it, okay?
Your job today is to study.
Hi.
I thought you'd have run off to Mexico to be with Frank by now.
You two get to spend the day babysitting each other.
I trust you'll be able to do that.
Excuse me while I pretend to be a good lawyer again.
As you can see, your reinstatement comes with the following conditions.
You agree to abstain from drinking, attend AA meetings three times a week, and submit to random alcohol testing.
We also expect to see a change in your conduct both inside and outside of court.
This board will not tolerate any of the moves that have characterized your practice in the past.
Moves?
Ethical violations, intimidation of witnesses, harassment of opponents, misleading judges, being party to any criminal acts.
Uh, just to be clear,
I have never been formally charged with a criminal act.
Let's keep it that way.
To confirm our agreement.
This is a two-strike system,
Annalise.
That's good. Do you need me to look into getting a lawyer for Wes maybe?
Annalise?
She get her license back?
Yeah.
You should call Frank, tell him the good news.
You have something to get off your chest?
I think I just did.
You're responsible for this -- the anger, drinking, her reputation right now.
You want me to believe
I caused all the problems in this house?
All the problems blew up the minute you got your little crush on Rebecca.
You have no idea what goes on in this house.
Did you see Waitlist?
Where?
In the exam.
I didn't see him.
Oh. He probably slept through his alarm.
-What a moron.
-Hey, what case did you guys cite for the court's decision to bifurcate the arbitration clause?
Vaden v. Discover Bank.
I thought that was about procedural unconscionability.
You're both wrong.
The court citation for the decision to bifurcate was KPMG v. Cocchi.
Did you guys even read my outline?
Listen, we're not friends.
Especially now that we know about your little art project.
Annalise said, no, we're not supposed to talk about that.
Why? You afraid one of us will out you, and you'll get expelled?
Leave.
Well, there she goes -- chewing up and spitting out men.
Good morning.
While I'm sure many of you were hoping I was gone for good,
I'm back and ready to whip you all into shape.
I assume many of you read the file on our new client.
The facts.
Ms. Cohen?
Dani Alvodar, an Army veteran.
She served two tours in Afghanistan and is now facing aggravated assault charges.
I wanted to take my girl, Val, out to celebrate her promotion.
We pre-gamed at my crib and went dancing at our favorite bar.
Dani's blood alcohol level was two times the legal limit that night.
If she admits to substance abuse, she could qualify for Veterans Treatment Court.
She'd go to rehab rather than face jail time.
That could result in her discharge from the Reserves.
She would lose her Army pension, making her years of risking her life for your freedom worth nothing.
Anyone with a good strategy?
He kept bugging us about making out.
I just thought he was one of those straight guys who watches too much porn.
We could argue that Dani felt so threatened by the victim's hate speech that she acted out of self-defense.
The victim was unarmed when our client sliced his neck open like a bagel.
Do you think that any jury would believe this was self-defense?
When he came up behind me, grabbed me, trying to dance... everything went black.
We can argue
"defense of others."
I left a message for the girlfriend to see if she'd testify that Dani was just trying to protect her.
She's the ex-girlfriend, and if you'd read the case files, you would know that she's stationed in Germany and unwilling to testify.
Please, Mr. Drake, save me from these terrible ideas.
To be honest, I'm hesitant to even present this because it seems so obvious, but we go with the PTSD defense.
It was a rescue mission.
I was guarding the Humvee when
I got attacked from behind.
The combatant put me into a choke hold, started bashing my head into the ground.
Finally, he just stopped.
My sergeant shot him in the head.
Additionally, we stress that Dani is a woman in combat.
Many jurors will find that admirable and brave.
You're first chair, Mr. Drake.
You'll be doing the cross on the victim.
I'll need your prep by 8:00 p.m. tonight.
And the rest of you, come watch me and Mr. Drake kick ass in court tomorrow.
You've taken a new case already?
You think it's too soon to dive back into work after hitting rock bottom?
I would never presume to know what a woman of your talent can and cannot handle.
Nor would I ever bring up your sobriety anywhere on this campus.
So, why are you here?
Did I piss someone off again?
Hopefully not, unless you know someone at the NYPD.
A detective called my office this morning.
They're looking for a student of yours -- Wes Gibbins.
He was absent from class today.
Okay.
I'll check in with his other professors, then.
Wallace Mahoney was an old client of mine, someone who was out of my life.
And they think
Wes shot him?
His father?
Biological father.
Oh, my God.
You knew about this.
-Of course she did.
-I told her not to tell you.
So now that you know everything, put away your anger.
I'm so sorry you lost your dad, man.
Why are you telling us this?
Because it's secrets that's ruined us in the past.
Okay. So, we let Wes go talk to the cops.
Not until we know why he's being questioned.
He can just tell them that Frank was the shooter.
No. Then he would have to tell them about Sam, Sinclair --
That's okay. Maybe we just need to face all this crap head on.
Even a meat stick would be smarter than to suggest that.
- Quiet.
Since when have I not protected you?
Even when I hated you?
Tell me.
Remember what I said.
We're good people now.
We'll get through this.
We'll get through it.
I just talked to Vince Levin.
He's willing to act as Wes' lawyer if he goes in for his police interview.
We can trust him.
Why do you say that?
You spread your legs for him, too?
Say what you need.
I can take it.
You can't.
I'm not sure
Frank gave them Wes' name.
He wouldn't want to make things worse between you two.
This is just him saving his own ass, Bonnie.
He told me he just wants to come home.
Oh, stop it.
He's scared, Annalise.
Well, he should be.
You know what?
Tell him that the next time you see him -- that if he comes anywhere near this house,
I'll kill him for real.
I'm here.
I came back to be with you.
Because you want to or because he wouldn't have you?
Because I love you.
Go home.
I can help on the case.
You being here is just hurting me right now.
Just go.
Thank God.
Wes is right inside.
He hates me right now.
It's fine.
Laurel.
You never told me what Frank said.
I barely saw him.
Something must have happened if he really did tell the cops Wes' name.
Nothing happened.
He's a sick bastard.
I warned you when we met.
It's Frank.
Leave a message.
You told the police who Wes is, didn't you?
Do you just hate us all?
Do you want us all to go to jail?
Is that the kind of guy you really are?
If you did this,
I'll never forgive you.
Hey.
You can't sit with us.
Are you serious?
Stop keeping secrets, and maybe you'll get your privileges back.
Oh, there he is, our first chair.
You ready to fail like your dad's condom?
Do you really have to sit right there?
I just want to be ready to replace you after you crash and burn.
Or poop your pants.
Hope you don't have a nervous stomach, dawg.
How are we feeling,
Mr. Drake?
Great.
I was rethinking my cross on the victim -- that maybe we can use the
Pozner/Dodd approach instead.
I liked your prep questions.
Stick with your first instinct.
Ms. Keating.
Welcome back.
Oh, you came to watch me kick your colleague's ass.
No. Actually, to kick your ass.
I requested to be co-counsel when I heard this was your case.
You're brave.
There's nothing brave about taking on a lawyer who's under the thumb of the Disciplinary Board.
May the best woman win.
Do I sense some animosity there?
I'm doing the cross now.
I spent all night prepping.
Well, court is unpredictable.
Sit down.
You may learn something.
We were all dancing, having a good time.
I mean, they were even laughing at my jokes.
At what point did the defendant become aggressive?
This guy bumped into me, and I fell up against her.
She took the knife out of her pocket, grabbed me.
I thought she was joking until I saw the blood.
Your witness.
Mr. Stone, how many drinks had you had before you approached my client?
Three or four beers.
So you lost count?
-Argumentative.
-Sustained.
Let me rephrase.
This isn't the first violent altercation you've had in a bar, is it?
Objection. Leading.
Goes to establishing Mr. Stone's pattern of violent behavior while inebriated.
Permission to approach.
Mr. Stone's priors are inadmissible per Rule 609.
Domestic abuse, yes.
But there was another violent incident that he had during his time in college.
Which could also be prejudicial.
I'm prohibiting the mention of all priors against the victim.
Mr. Stone, did you think buying my client a free drink was a down payment on a later sexual advance?
Objection. Counsel is badgering the witness.
Sustained.
Can you tell me what you meant when you yelled "scissor" to Ms. Alvodar?
-Objection. Offensive question.
-Sustained.
Can you describe the man that you allegedly claim made you bump into Dani?
Objection.
Outside the scope of direct examination.
- Sustained.
Was the music so loud that you couldn't hear my client repeatedly tell you to leave her alone?
Objection.
Calls for speculation.
How long did A.D.A. Atwood spend coaching you on your testimony today?
Objection.
Counsel is clearly trying to impugn the witness,
Your Honor.
Sustained.
Please, Ms. Keating, move on, or I'll be inclined to report this conduct to the bar.
No further questions.
Professor Keating?
Give me a second.
Dani's ex-girlfriend just called me back.
We're not using your stupid defense of others.
It's better than that.
You might even want me to replace Simon as first chair -- again.
You stole the boy's computer.
Now you want to steal his job?
He deserves it.
He's poor.
He's trying to better his life.
You, of all people, should be able to relate.
So, you don't want to know what I found out?
Say it.
Dani was working a desk job on the day she claims she was attacked in Afghanistan.
Our whole defense is based on a lie.
It's not a lie.
You made that story up.
I didn't make it up.
I stole it.
Most of the time
I was over there,
I had to file all the injury and casualty reports -- how soldiers were maimed, how they died, how many pieces they went home in.
That story might have not happened to me, but I felt it.
I have to tell the judge.
No.
It's illegal for me to put you on that stand and perjure yourself.
Then tell me what to do...
'cause I'm not this person.
I just don't go around knifing people at bars.
I need help, not jail.
I half expected to catch you trying on her wigs and clothes all Norman-Bates-like.
Annalise isn't here.
I know, I know.
I, um...
I just came by to make sure that my good friend was thinking about someone else other than himself for once.
Meaning?
You're thinking about going to the police, right?
Telling them everything?
You should go.
No, I think you should listen to what I have to say.
You blame me for everything.
I get it.
Of course I blame you for everything.
You're the reason that everything good in our lives is gone.
Frank did this.
No, you did this the minute that you killed Sam.
You know, I
I was just figuring out how to get my head on straight and finally get out of this whole mess that you made, even without the one good thing in my life.
Now Oliver's my fault?
Everything that has happened to us in this house is your fault!
If you say anything to the police...
I'm not gonna --
If you mention my name to the police,
I swear to God,
I will kill you.
Get in.
The NYPD's looking for Wes.
You hiding him?
You think that's smart?
Oh, please, don't yell at me right now.
I just don't want to see something happen to the kid
'cause he got caught up in your mess.
What have you heard?
They got an anonymous tip about him being a possible suspect.
I'm protecting him, so don't worry.
Wait.
You've got a case with her right now, so I wanted you to hear it from me.
Atwood and I are seeing each other.
Hmm.
Well... thank you for letting me know.
What about that new bar on 18th Street?
No. I don't want to suggest a straight bar.
Why don't you go to a bowling alley?
You seriously think this sophisticated, spiritual acupuncturist goes bowling?
I should take Heidi bowling.
Yeah, I think she'd like that.
Heidi?
Oh, yeah.
She's just this blonde
I've been talking to on Tinder.
Actually, you know, maybe a hotel bar would be better.
Have some drinks, get a room, slide my key card in her slot.
Here.
I told Thomas to meet you at that wine and cheese bar tomorrow at 7:30.
Who's Thomas?
Uh, no one.
Just a stupid Internet date.
It's not important.
Did you talk to him?
Yeah.
It went well.
Who? Wes?
What did you say to him?
What he needed to hear.
Which means what?
It sucks, right?
Not knowing what goes on in Annalise's house?
Have any of you guys heard from Professor Keating?
She hasn't returned any of my calls, and we have to prep Dani for the stand tomorrow.
Oh.
Actually, Annalise decided not to put Dani on the stand anymore.
Since when?
Since I sabotaged your case and nobody told you about it.
You're all mean girls.
Hey.
I need sleep, Wes.
I know what to do.
You use the recording of Frank to negotiate immunity for us.
Then --
-I can't.
You did it when Philip sent us those videos.
That was before I was on probation.
No D.A. is gonna negotiate with me right now.
You don't want to turn Frank in.
Don't be stupid.
You still care about him.
I lost a child because of him.
Car accident.
Your father caused it.
Frank helped him.
I'm so sorry.
It's not your fault.
It is.
All this is happening because you keep trying to protect me.
That was my choice.
I took you off the waitlist.
I should have left you alone, but --
Why didn't you?
I wanted to be a better person.
You guys exchange peen pics yet?
Is he bigger than me?
No.
Love that.
"No" meaning we haven't exchanged photos.
You're not mad, are you?
Of course I'm mad.
Well, I was fine with you hooking up with half of Philadelphia.
That's 'cause I was honest about it -- and maybe too honest.
But you're hiding things from me.
Well, you are overreacting.
No. You know what?
Answer me this.
Why even go on a date if the whole reason we broke up was because you said that you needed time alone?
Going out on dates is part of being alone.
Maybe you just don't want to go on dates with me.
Connor, we broke up.
Okay? So I'm allowed to see other people.
You showed up two days in a row.
Every day you'll let me.
Call that lawyer.
Tell him to come here to meet Wes tonight.
Bonnie?
I need your help at court.
Ms. Keating, are you ready to begin?
The defense calls
Daniela Alvodar to the stand.
I'm coming for you.
Hi.
I'm looking for a combat record for an active Army Reserves member, Daniela Alvodar.
Can you tell us about the events that took place
August 10, 2013?
I was on a rescue mission for aid workers in Afghanistan, guarding an Humvee when I got attacked from behind.
The combatant put me in a choke hold, started hitting my head.
This is urgent, ma'am.
I heard you.
I still have nightmares, wake up screaming.
Did you see anyone about these symptoms?
I went to the VA.
The doctor said it was PTSD.
And do you think that this PTSD contributed to your altercation with Jace Stone?
-Objection. Speculation.
-Sustained.
Can you tell us about when Mr. Stone approached you on the dance floor?
He came up from behind me, pressing his body against mine.
Would you say that this reminded you of the attack that you described?
Yes.
I was in that moment all over again.
That's when everything went black.
One moment, please.
Ms. Keating?
I've just received new evidence and request a meeting in your chambers.
It's urgent, Your Honor.
Let's take 15.
It's a combat report detailing the attack that my client just testified about.
Just now your associate came across this?
If you're inferring that someone is lying, you would be correct.
But it's not my associate.
It's my client.
Explain, Ms. Keating.
She was working a desk job on the day that she said she was attacked.
Had I known that,
I would never have asked her to take the stand.
Judge, please.
This is Ms. Keating's attempt to get a mistrial.
No, the Pennsylvania Bar requires me to inform you of this perjury.
Now, I could have kept this from the court, but then I would be in violation of the oath
I swore as a practicing attorney.
Is that what Your Honor would prefer?
I don't get this plan.
Avoiding the police is just going to incriminate you.
It's actually talking to the police where most people get in trouble.
But my aunt is a lawyer, so you can get a second opinion.
No.
Don't call her.
You need to make sure you have the right people on your team right now, Wes.
Meggy, stop.
Please.
This is too much for you.
I'm too much for you.
No, you're not.
I am.
I'm dragging you into things you don't deserve.
No.
Look... you are just scared right now, so you're pushing me away.
But you need someone who's gonna be on your team, and I want to be that person.
Wes...
...please.
I love you.
You should go.
No.
Please.
I can't do this anymore.
You have to go.
The A.D.A. has offered a deal.
Plead guilty to Misdemeanor
Reckless Endangerment, and they forgo a new trial.
So it all worked?
You didn't let me finish.
You have to agree to Veterans Treatment Court.
Now, you told me you had a substance-abuse problem.
So instead of jail, you meet with a judge once a week.
They monitor your progress.
I'll be kicked out of the Reserves.
Would you rather go to prison?
No, but...
I don't have a substance-abuse problem.
You told me you needed help.
Or would you rather go around slitting people's throats?
Being angry, alone, miserable?
This is your chance to get better.
Take it.
And this spot just below the base of the skull is Urinary Bladder 10.
Poking there release trauma and anxiety.
Yeah, I-I can feel it.
Yeah, I can tell.
I've been wanting to do that ever since you mispronounced "manchego."
Oh, no.
Is that how you pronounce it?
Mm-hmm.
Oh.
Uh, Thomas, I'm --
Can we pause for a second?
Yeah, sure.
What's wrong?
Uh, nothing.
I mean, I-I hope nothing.
I just --
Before we go inside --
Who said
I was going inside?
Oh, my -- Wow.
That's embarrassing.
I just thought...
That I wanted to get you naked?
Yeah.
I only sleep with guys on the first date when I don't want to see them again.
So, um... till date number two?
Good night.
Mm.
Is that Laurel?
Did they finally arrest Wes?
It's Oliver.
How did his date go?
You really want to know?
No.
That's healthy.
Hotel bar was a genius idea.
Heidi couldn't even finish her second drink before she was begging me to come upstairs.
Did you come all the way here just to tell us that you got laid?
Yeah, yeah.
Why?
Is that weird?
It's not weird.
It just didn't happen.
Yeah, fine.
I made Heidi up, but I did it to prove a point.
Ah. I got that part.
Who are you?
Seriously, what of kind of person isn't jealous when they find out their boyfriend is screwing some other girl?
There you are with that word again.
I am your boyfriend,
Michaela.
Who do you think you are?!
Telling me you're my boyfriend when we've never talked about that.
Because you only are using me for sex!
We're using each other for sex.
Okay, well,
I want more than that.
All right?
I want to know you, Michaela.
And I don't know if I want you to.
Well, that's offensive.
No, no, no.
What's offensive is, you making me your woman like we're cave people.
Okay, fine.
You're not my woman.
You're my family.
What?
Not in the gross sister way.
I...
I lost my family -- all of them.
I never had a family.
It's not that big a deal.
What does that mean?
I'm not talking about this with you.
Hey.
Hey.
I want to be there for you,
Michaela.
No, you want me to be there for you, like every other guy who's screwed me over.
I like you so much.
Okay.
"Okay" like you like me, too?
Whatever.
No.
I want you to say it.
I like you, too.
Vince.
Ms. Keating.
Honor to meet, finally.
Did Wes ask you to wait out here?
Well, I knocked, and nobody answered.
Please come in.
Can I get you a cup of coffee or tea?
That sounds great.
Decaf if you have it.
Does Annalise know you're here?
What are you doing?
You're my witness, okay?
That I destroyed this.
Wes! No!
Why did you do that?
If the cops know Frank did this, they'll blame Annalise.
What are you talking about?
I just have to tell the police what I've been saying this whole time --
I went to New York on my own.
Frank was never there.
It's smart.
It protects Frank, too.
You think
I want to protect Frank?
Don't you?
No.
You knew where he was, and you didn't tell me.
Who am I here with right now, Wes?
You, not Frank.
I'm just saying I get it.
If you still worry about him, that's fine.
Look at me.
I am not in love with Frank.
Meggy.
I broke up with her.
This will just make everything more complicated.
I know.
Say it again.
Stop.
Please.
It turns me on.
I like you.
Again.
I like you.
One minute.
- It's Laurel.
Leave a message, but I'll probably never listen.
Are you with Wes?
Call me back, or you're fired.
-Hey.
-Anything?
No.
Use the bathroom at the Wawa.
-Connor!
-Oh!
Not cool, bro.
You guys have to see this.
Sources confirm that Wallace Mahoney's own son is currently being held without bail, charged with first-degree murder.
Tell me you're with Wes.
He turned himself in.
Turn on the news.
...in New York City just blocks from where Wallace Mahoney was killed five months ago with a single bullet wound to the head.
Wes?
Wes?
Wes, are you here?
Look.
Police have just confirmed that the identity of the suspect in custody is, in fact, Charles Mahoney.
No stranger to the justice system,
Charles was charged with the violent murder of his fiancÐÂ©e, Vickie Moran, in 2005.
But after a highly publicized trial, he was acquitted and released.
Frank.
The arrest was made earlier this evening after authorities found the suspected murder weapon, an unregistered Remington 2020, in his car.
I told you --
He just wants to come home.
Police say it is still too early to speculate the potential motive for killing his father, given that they are still in the preliminary stages of gathering evidence.
NYPD is set to hold a press conference within the hour to explain just how they discovered the murder weapon...
What does this mean?
...at this exact time.
We're safe now.
And, of course, we will cut to that press conference as soon as it starts.
Asher! Asher!
Asher, please open the door!
I thought you were dead.
What?
I'm just drunk.
Annalise's house burned down.
Someone's dead.
What?
Where's Connor?
You were with him, right?
And Laurel.
Laurel's in the hospital.
When's the last time you saw them all?
Before Annalise called us.
Ohh.
Annalise called you?
When you were with your mom.
She asked us to come over.
Is someone really dead?

## S03E7

 Previously on "how to get away
 with murder"...
Uh, Thomas, I'm -- can we pause for a second?
Till date number two?
The police are at my apartment.
Are they still there?
Yeah.
They're from New York.
Miss? Is that him?
No.
This is frank -- he gave the police your name to make you a suspect.
A detective called looking for Wes gibbins.
He was absent from class today.
I just have to tell the police
I went to New York on my own.
 The suspect in custody
 is Wallace mahoney's own son,
 Charles mahoney.
Frank.
I told you -- he just wants to come home.
Annalise keating, you're under arrest.
 No!
You sure you don't want us to wait for your attorney?
Just tell me.
The official charge -- arson and first-degree murder.
The evidence?
An anonymous source.
They've provided information that ties you to the charges.
Now do you want your attorney?
You lost your phone?
Last I had it was at the library.
You must have been in contact with your girlfriend, meggy Travers.
We actually broke up.
To be clear, my client contacted you the minute he heard you were looking for him.
Now he's reaffirmed his original statement about the shooting.
So...Can we go?
Any chance you saw this man during the scene of the shooting?
You've had that man in custody for days now.
Clearly, you have enough evidence against him.
Wes?
Don't speak to my --
I saw him...
Standing in a doorway across the street.
I remember because I was gonna ask him for directions, but he looked upset, so I crossed the street and...
You know what happened then.
You're mad.
So you agree I have the right to be pissed off at you?
I wouldn't have said any-- you lied. Why?
If Charles were your client, you'd have that gun thrown out before we even got to trial.
It's got his fingerprints on it.
Who shoots their father and doesn't get rid of the gun?
How do you know
Charles doesn't have an alibi?
That this wasn't just their way of catching you in a lie?
Tell me.
It's okay.
Is it?
Yeah, I called Eve, and the NYPD's only interested in Charles.
It's a good headline for them.
Have you heard from frank?
No.
Maybe we got lucky and he killed himself.
Come on, our client's waiting.
 They couldn't figure out
 what was wrong with me.
 Finally, they tested my blood
 and realized I had been
 poisoned with antifreeze.
 What would you like to say
 to those who did this to you?
 I've searched my soul,
 but there's no understanding
 any of this.
 What kind of children
 try to kill their own mother?
That whole interview was an Oscar performance.
Mr. duvall.
She's no probably not even sick.
Jared, back me up on this.
She's not a nice lady.
We don't care.
Listen, from here on out, the only feelings you have for your mother are love and devotion.
The prosecution has forced us into holding depositions before the trial.
Their excuse is that Edith can die at any time, so it would be in our best interest to get the case out pre-trial -- not an easy task considering the evidence.
Is it true that you and your siblings exchanged text messages about killing your mother?
We were joking.
So you're claiming the text,
"let's cut off her head and boil it in the slow cooker with the chili" was a joke?
If you knew how much mom loves chili, you'd get why that's funny.
Edith will be present at all the depositions.
This is a ploy by the prosecution to trigger our clients into saying something stupid on camera.
Quite possible considering who we're dealing with.
So you guys had family dinner at the restaurant once a week, was that right?
If we didn't show, even just once, we'd be removed the will.
Jared, that's an example of a question you might want to just answer with a yes or no.
Excuse me,
I'm in the middle of my prep.
And I'm just trying to make sure that our client understands the full weight of each and every one of his responses.
Yeah, I understand.
Great.
But I do want to warn each of you that mom is a genius manipulator.
Show any weakness in front of her, and she'll use it to her advantage.
The key to beating this is to make the sure the siblings present a united front.
Is it possible one of your brothers did this?
No, Nelson and Jared both love our mother dearly.
And you?
Of course.
Really? Even though her pet name for you was
"big kahunas Karen"?
They need to speak in detail about their affection for their mother.
I had matured quite early, but she wouldn't let me wear a bra.
Instead, she just came up with the nickname.
"Half Nelson" because she said it fit my below-average IQ.
"Jerky Jared" 'cause she caught me masturbating once.
This is a woman who read my diary in front of all the employees at a staff meeting.
If she smells blood, she goes in for the kill.
So you did want her dead?
You tell me who did it, and I'll buy him a drink.
Any of you get some major keating vibes in there?
What are you talking about?
A controlling, sadistic power-monger who lies to her kids' faces, verbally abusive.
Did you just admit you want to poison Annalise?
Wha-- no.
This what I heard you say.
Hmm, me, too.
- Me three.
What a trainwreck.
Whenever you mention the word "mommy," they turn into sniveling ingrates.
It would be malpractice to put them in front of a camera.
So what?
We file a motion to postpone?
No, we'll float the prosecution a new suspect and they'll cancel the depositions completely.
Look into any disgruntled restaurant employees first.
Wait -- if there's no deposition, then there can be no first chair.
What, you need a prize in order to do your job?
We just started studying for midterms, is all.
All right.
Whoever brings me a good suspect gets an automatic "a" on my midterm.
Everyone happy?
Here -- if we divide and conquer, we can look into every employee in the box.
How are we supposed to divide and conquer an "a"?
We draw straws.
Ah! Like hell
I'm letting a straw determine by gpa.
Every woman for herself.
I'm gonna go talk to this busboy.
Wanna ride?
I'll talk to people, too.
Cool.
They're really going to kill frank, right?
Mm, as long they leave us out of it for once.
Maybe we just tell them before they find out.
I'm not worried about them,
I'm worried about Annalise.
Don't say that.
She still hates me.
Yeah, but I don't want to be thinking about Annalise right now.
Or the fact that you lied to the police this morning?
Exactly.
Distract me.
Mmm.
Maybe Laurel should call her dad.
He found frank once.
Maybe he can do it again.
Or maybe you need to call him.
Tell him I'm here to welcome him with open arms.
If he's going to reach out to any of us, it's not going to be me.
Why not?
I said things he didn't take so well.
Like?
That he doesn't deserve you.
Do you really just want to wait for him to show up?
I just think better when I drink.
It's only 6:00.
You've only been once this week.
A truck driver had called 911, said I'd fallen asleep.
Nico and grace were in the car with me.
I'd picked them up at the nanny's -- at the nanny's after work -- meaning the happy hour after work.
Apparently,
I pulled over to the side of the road, fell asleep with the car running.
Nico ran into the street to wave down help.
My husband, Raul, filed for custody the next day.
Hope you divorced his ass.
It's not him I'm mad at.
It's me.
I'm a drunk mother, and I have to live with what I put my kids through for the rest of my life.
Today's my, uh, one year anniversary.
- Yes.
And I'm doing okay.
I work my steps.
I see Nico and grace twice a week -- supervised visits.
They're still upset, and they don't hide it, and I get it.
They get to be upset with right now.
They get to hate me right now.
Okay.
On the real,
I'm ashamed of what I did, of course, but I'm -- I'm pissed, too.
I'm their mother...
...but they won't even look me in the eye.
And it just -- it makes me want to shake them or yell or something so that they'll...
...see that I'll do anything to get them back -- anything.
Oh, I...
I just don't think it means that I should lose my kids.
-How's frank?
-What?
That's where you snuck off to, right?
Are you kidding me?
You do look a little flush.
Tell me, does the beard tickle down there?
I'm asking for a friend.
Did we find a suspect yet?
The, uh...
Busboy did not pan out.
What?
They think i was just with frank.
Maybe you both were with him.
Oh, two beards, one girl.
That's hot.
Okay, that -- sexualizing me without my permission -- is creating a hostile work environment.
She's right.
Thank you.
Shut up.
We're still not friends.
Michaela.
Ooh! There goes my "a," bitches.
Okay.
Tell me my waitress is a known black widow.
Uh, no. She moved to Maine six months before the poisoning.
But look what Thomas sent me.
Mm, I thought I was gonna get to see his penis.
Th-- no!
Thomas isn't like that.
We were talking about how we hate it when guys send flowers, so this is him being ironic.
It's cute.
I choose you, hack-a-chu.
Roger Colby, produce manager.
I need you to hack his killer face.
Yeah, I've got like 20 other employees people asked me to look into, so...
Mm, yet you have time to send lame text messages to your acupuncturist.
Oh, that's still going on?
Yeah, we're going on our third date tomorrow night.
Ooh! Third date's the sex date.
You ready to get it in, or is he the one getting it in?
Shh! Connor'll hear you.
Okay, I was fine with him cruising humpr in front of me.
Those were one-offs.
You're really falling for this guy.
It's not that serious.
Ah!
It's not, guys!
Ohh!
Aww, little oli's a terrible liar.
E-e-e-e.
Go away.
Please, I'm busy.
Are you the one who signs these?
Yeah.
But I can't sign until the meeting's over.
Otherwise, half this room will bail on the break.
Would that be such a bad thing?
Show your face around here more often.
I'll hook you up one time.
Careful.
I hear he's a 13th stepper.
He screws the new people.
Oh, well, he's barking up the wrong tree.
That took guts.
Put me in front of a courtroom, sure.
But spilling my dirt to strangers...
You'll get there.
Mm, I doubt that.
So, uh, I heard you got your student a lawyer -- the one the police were looking for.
I recommended a lawyer.
You need one, too?
Sounds like your husband's got a pretty good case.
Look, I'm just...
Being friendly here to the point where I'm questioning my own self-respect.
You think i wanna be friends?
Listen, the only reason
I have to come to these stupid meetings is because of you.
No, you're here because you smacked a client.
So let's just consider a scenario where I'm not the enemy here.
I'm just hungry.
Excuse me while I see about the stale doughnuts.
He's hot, right?
That's the dishwasher at the restaurant.
Whatever happened to you being totally against me doing any illegal hacking?
It's my gpa, Oliver.
You're being ridiculous.
No.
You know what's ridiculous is you not looking at your texts in front of me.
Why?
Is it Thomas?
Nope.
Let me guess -- he's taking you to the poconos this weekend?
Connor.
Oh, he could get you one of those rooms with the champagne glass tub -- booya!
You smell that, people?!
That's the stank of an automatic a-a-a-a!
Yeah, oli hacked produce guy's e-mail.
Guess what he sent someone a link to just three weeks before Edith was poisoned?
It's an article about...
Antifreeze.
He e-mailed this article to someone about three weeks before your mother got sick.
I told you we could never do this.
I know.
Guys...
Seriously, can I give you a hug?
No.
You can hug me.
Guys!
You can't show the prosecutor that e-mail.
This is our "get out of jail free" card, literally.
Why not, Karen?
Roger sent that e-mail to me.
We've been seeing each other for the past year.
He knew about our texts, so he e-mailed me the article as a joke.
Always a freakin' secret e-mail address.
Or a secret boyfriend!
I didn't want mom to sabotage it.
Is that why you tried to kill her, too?
I didn't.
Please, I love my mother.
I would never do anything to hurt her.
You need to drop her and just represent us.
Yeah.
What?
You and your boyfriend are the only idiots they can connect this to.
That's not true.
It's a conspiracy charge.
All the texts implicate all of you.
So if there's proof one of you did it, it proves you all did it.
You stupid bitch!
We're all gonna go down because of you!
Hey, maybe one of you did this to set me up!
Hey!
Your depositions are tomorrow, so you all have to stick to the story that we've prepared.
Can you do that?
Or should we just send you all to jail right now?
Whoa.
Slow down.
What are you doing here?
Nothing, just got a meeting with the d.A.
Oh.
I haven't seen you around the house much.
No.
Oh.
Well, it was, uh...
It was good to see you.
Hey.
How'd it go with NYPD?
They came to the station looking for you.
I overheard your name.
It's fine.
My, uh...
My lawyer took care of it.
Annalise?
No, this guy she recommended.
Just watch your ass.
I'm good.
Good.
"Let's make a skin suit out of her and wear it to the funeral."
Mr. duvall, you wrote that text to your brother and sister just two weeks before your mother took ill, is that correct?
I was just venting.
A dark sense of humor can get anyone through hard times.
Are you speaking of the hard times you experienced due to working with your mother?
Anyone who works with family knows it's not easy.
And how would you describe your relationship with your mother outside of work?
I'd say just like any other mother/daughter relationship.
Because it was so contentious?
No.
Even when we disagreed, there was always love between us.
Jared, a co-worker of yours stated that your mother humiliated you in front of a woman you were dating.
Do you recall this event?
I do not.
Let me remind you.
"Edith then proceeded to tell a story about how Jared once reached under his mother's dress at his birthday party when he was 13."
He was 14 and old enough to know better.
Strike Mrs. duvall's last statement from the record and remind her she's not allowed to speak.
I apologize.
You must have been angry with your mother for emasculating you like that, especially in front of a woman who you'd hoped to be intimate with.
She was never gonna screw him.
My client needs a break.
He's a virgin, probably will be till he dies.
And you wonder why people want you dead?!
Jared.
What kind of monster gets off on mocking her own son?
One of needs to get off.
I look forward to the day you die.
We say the depo was mandated under false pretenses.
That way the footage can never be shown in court.
And if we lose that motion, the explosion gets played for the entire jury at trial.
We argue that Jared had a mental break, which made him legally incompetent to testify as a witness.
A mental illness diagnosis only makes him look more capable of offing his mother.
So we just wait to get our asses kicked in trail?
Well, unless you can pull a rabbit out of your ass, that's exactly what I'm saying.
I still get an "a" for finding that secret e-mail though, right?
Professor keating?
Have you heard from meggy?
Stop.
This would be easier if I didn't actually like her.
Laurel.
I'm scared, Wes.
I don't want to wake up and realize none of this was real.
It's real for me.
It is for me, too.
I wanted this since our first day in class...
...when you answered that question for me, and Annalise destroyed you.
You never said anything.
I thought you were out of my league.
Same.
Come on.
What?
Seriously, though.
I thought I'd never stand a chance.
Look at you now.
Huh?
Connor.
Hey, what is it?
 What it always is.
You being my personal herpes sore that won't go away.
Okay,
I'm just gonna hang up.
Charles mahoney has an alibi.
 My team was able
 to uncover evidence
 concretely placing Charles
 at a location
 far from the scene
 of his father's shooting.
 Once the d.A.'S office
 reviews this evidence,
 I'm confident that these
 unwarranted, ludicrous charges
 will be dropped,
 and my client will be able
 to get back to running
 the company his father built
 from the ground up...
You told me Eve said the police were only interested --
 ...and the
 New York police department...
That was a lie.
...will finally find the actual
 suspect who did this.
Eve moved to San Francisco. I haven't spoken to her in weeks.
So we're not safe?
Who knows?
-Just talk to us.
-What are we supposed to do?
-Where are you going?
-Don't walk away.
I don't know what to do!
That's the truth.
Sometimes I lie to protect you, to keep you from worrying, because I know it can drive a person insane.
No, it's the lies that drive us insane.
Seriously, you ask us to trust you, and you keep hiding stuff from us.
She's doing the best she can.
But we're not asking her to be perfect.
Okay, we're just asking her to be honest.
Or are you not capable of that?
Otherwise, we might find out that you're not as smart as we think you are.
So, you have things to get off your chest -- let's do this.
I don't want to end up poisoned.
So you tell me all the ways you think I've ruined your life.
Come at me.
I said, come at me!
And then you pimped me out to Caleb like I was some kind of hooker.
You knew I was vulnerable after Aiden, so you sent me into that psychopath's arms.
I never told you to screw that boy.
But you wanted me to.
In what world do you think i have time to think about who you pull down your skirt for?
You're not allowed to talk right now!
This is our time -- you said that.
So sit there and take it.
None of this would have happened if you just let us go to the police after Sam.
But, you know, instead, you -- you started this insane game of chess of -- of running around and lying...
I thought you were this amazing, powerful woman, but look at your life.
You have no one.
I do whatever you say -- that's what our relationship is -- you controlling me and me following your orders like some...Puppet.
I thought my father was a bully, but you take it to a whole nother level.
And now we're -- we're all basket cases.
But, you know, maybe you like that.
I mean, you don't respect any of us.
But the worst part is that I don't think you respect yourself.
And it makes me feel sick that some part of me still just wants to please you.
Cold, two-faced...
Mean alcoholic...
I don't want to hate you...
...angry in this way that i didn't know was possible...
It just makes me feel alone...
You're not happy.
...and scared...
We're not happy.
...to the point that i wake up every morning and I think, "maybe we should just go to jail."
None of us are happy.
...and it's making me act insane.
-Phony.
-Confused.
-Miserable.
-Pathetic.
-Pissed off.
-Sad.
-Hopeless.
-Toxic.
-Insane.
-Exhausted.
-Two-sided.
-Broken.
Tired.
Go ahead.
No.
I can take it, Wes.
It's not that.
You already know how I feel about you.
Get a good night's sleep.
We'll start fresh tomorrow.
What -- you're shy?
You're not?
It's not how your body looks -- it's how you use it.
Okay.
Come here.
Come here.
All right, okay, okay, okay.
You...Just stay right there.
I'm staying.
There's no shame in this.
He can react however he wants to react.
The most important thing is that you just got to be you.
You got this, Hampton.
I, uh, hope you don't mind i went into your drawer.
Just figured we could probably use these.
Yeah, that, um...
That depends.
Oh, I see.
Now you're gonna play hard to get.
Mm.
Thomas.
I'm listening.
I'm poz.
Like, undetectable.
I-i went to the doctor a week ago, which means, if we use a condom, it's actually safer to have sex with me than it is with someone who says he's negative but then, like, hasn't been tested recently.
I'm just telling you all of this because, uh, you're naked, which is awesome.
Like, wow.
Uh, are you mad?
No, no, god, no.
Of course not.
Uh, I was just really starting to like you.
Is that such a bad thing?
Oh, my god, no.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
This is...
This is coming out all wrong.
Is it?
Yes.
'Cause I don't need you to mince words.
This is just new to me.
Yeah, it's new to me, too.
And you understand.
I mean, it's just...
I don't know.
It's a -- it's a lot to process.
Oliver, honestly, I...
I don't know if I'm ready to deal with all this.
 Finally, they tested my blood
 and realized I had been
 poisoned with antifreeze.
 At this point,
 it's not a matter of if,
 but when it takes my life.
 What would like to say...
I thought you might be hungry.
Does it have rum in it?
A few more weeks of no drinking and they can add fat-ass to their list of insults.
They're just scared.
 Was there a history
 of hostility?
 The business
 put a roof over our heads,
 but family was everything.
Help me salvage this case.
 Who would believe
 that my children
 would do this thing?
 I sacrificed so much
 for them.
 And police
 brought charges
 against all three
 of your children, correct?
How about using this interview?
You could say it biased the jury pool, making a fair trail impossible.
You could motion for a bench trial.
 Why do you think your children
 would do this to you...
Or if we do have a jury trial
 ...seeking destruction?
We can seek an instruction...
 I don't know.
I've done nothing but love them
 and gave them everything.
...limiting the depositions to impeachment evidence if our clients have to take the stand.
 Because that's
 what a mother does.
 You're also the boss,
 correct?
Bonnie.
What?
 You're the owner and manager
 of duvall's kitchen.
Edith poisoned herself.
That's insane.
She must've known about Karen's secret e-mails and did it to herself.
You have no proof.
Let's just say i can understand why a mother would want to punish her ungrateful children.
Okay, uh, so, you confront her during her deposition?
No.
 You confront her during her deposition.
What -- you don't want the automatic "a"?
Uh, yeah, no, of course I do.
I just, uh...
Why me?
Because you're my puppet.
Mrs. duvall, during his deposition yesterday, your oldest son, Jared, testified that -- my oldest is Nelson.
Oh, sorry.
Um, your --
Nelson testified that, uh, you depended on him for everything.
Is that what he said?
Uh...I belive so.
Is that not true?
I relied on my son for things any mother would.
I just never thought he'd try to murder me for that.
All right.
Hang on.
My, uh, cards got mixed up.
She's a disaster.
Ms. keating, perhaps you should take over so our witness isn't forced to be up here for too long.
This is a teaching clinic.
Just let us know if you need a break.
Oh, no.
I've been waiting for this for a long time.
Here!
Would you say you're involved in your children's love lives?
There isn't much to be involved in sadly.
Really?
They're all single, unhappily so.
Oh, because I believe
Karen mentioned she was involved with a man who delivered your produce.
Oh, Roger Colby used her for sex.
That's not a real relationship.
Um...
Mrs. duvall, Karen kept her relationship with Roger a secret.
So how'd you find out about it?
Call it mother's intuition.
Or did you find out by snooping into her secret e-mail?
Excuse me.
Ms. keating -- you require your employees to lock their cellphones in your desk while they're working, correct?
You don't have to answer that.
It's company policy.
A policy that allowed you to read Karen's e-mail about poisoning you, which is why you decided to poison yourself.
That's how angry you were at them.
I call for a break.
I will not be accused of lies in this room.
Then admit what you did.
Mrs. duvall -- is this what you wanted -- to tell everyone how you feel?
You gave your children your life, and they paid you back by fantasizing about your death.
It devastated you...
To the point where that you risked your life to teach them a lesson.
Mrs. duvall, you have the right to seek advice of counsel.
Children always take their mothers for granted.
Maybe now mine won't.
Nothing further.
The automatic "a" is yours, Ms. castillo.
The rest of you, i suggest you start studying.
I'm in the mood to give some f's.
Oh, she handed you that win.
Don't look so cocky.
Mm!
I'll trade you my outlines for the rest of the year.
Never, but drinks on me, everyone, at Liberty hill.
Hey, want to walk over to the bar...Together?
Uh, you know, i should go study.
Wow, look at you, taking your schoolwork all seriously.
Yeah, you know, fake it till you make it.
Right.
Hey, are -- are you okay?
Yeah.
President hargrove.
Hi.
Give me your phone.
I'm sorry?
I know the best family attorney in the city.
Oh, no need.
Raul and I are trying to work things out.
And you know he's not going to change his mind?
Her name is Nina horton.
She's great.
Thanks.
Any time.
You finally want your shot to come at me, too?
I ran in to Nate at the courthouse.
Did he say something to you?
He told me to be careful.
Of me?
I'm sorry i lied to the police.
It's fine.
Not if Charles has an alibi.
You'll just have say that you saw someone who looked like him.
And then what?
We wait till the next terrible thing happens?
I wanted to tell Nate it's you who should be protected from me.
Ah, stop feeling sorry for yourself.
I'm just saying what everyone thinks.
They're wrong.
You don't have the luxury to feel guilty right now.
It's not fair to your mother.
She sacrificed for you to have a good life.
So that's your job to live as good as you can.
We both owe her that.
Hey.
Hey.
You're drunk.
Yep.
Can I drink that water?
Did something happen with Thomas?
Yeah, Thomas isn't ready to date a poz guy.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's fine.
It's not.
I want to say something, but I'm not sure if it's just me being selfish.
Say it.
I miss you, and i-i know i shouldn't tell you that
'cause i-i broke up with you.
And i-i hurt you, and I see that every single day.
So for me to come here just because I'm, like, sad and depressed, that's...Not fair.
You can always come to me.
You know that.
Isn't that just selfish, though?
No.
'Cause I miss you, too.
Ah...
She won't notice.
It's Michaela.
Of course she will.
Whatever.
You were right...
...that I need to go to her, tell her everything.
I just felt like I needed to do something that proves she can still trust me.
I'm so sorry i left you.
Was Laurel not home?
She must've been your first stop.
I'm just your...
Sloppy seconds.
You're mad.
I understand that.
I'm not mad.
I'm just bored.
I needed to go fix things on my own.
Then tell me that instead of abandoning me in some motel room.
I was afraid you'd stop me.
I don't believe you!
I lied to Annalise to help you, risked everything.
And you just threw it back in my face.
You used me.
No.
That meant something to me.
I can't believe anything you say anymore.
I screwed up, a-and I hate myself for that.
You should.
But I need you so bad right now.
You killed us the minute you left me in that room.
This isn't you talking.
This is the most honest
I've ever been with you.
It's Annalise.
She's in your head.
Annalise was the only one of us who was right about you.
Sam just fell for your act, and so did I, and that was the worst mistake any of us ever made.
Please don't do this.
Get out.
I'll do anything.
I said, get out.
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Oh, I hope to god
Connor's not here.
I want to make noise.
Mm.
Hey.
Wait. You two are friends again?
We've always been friends.
Yay to my bro-mos!
Asher.
Ah, sorry, gentlemen.
Duty calls.
Connor, why is my duvet upside-down?!
I'd probably be drunk, too, if I already had an "a" on a midterm.
 I'm not drunk.
I'm tipsy, and I'll give you my "a" if you want it.
I know how hard tests are for you.
Ow! Ohh.
Okay, you should probably go to bed before you hurt yourself.
 I'll see you
 in class tomorrow, okay?
Fine.
Good night.
Good night.
Love you.
Really?
Page Dr. lowell!
It's meggy.
It's meggy, Laurel.
You're okay.
You have a tube in your throat, and it's helping you breathe.
So I just need you stay calm.
The doctor's on her way, okay?
It's gonna be all right.
It's okay.
What? What? What?
What is it?
What?
Pen? This?
Okay, okay.
Here, here.
Here. Right here.
Oliver and I have been trying to calling him, okay?
It's late, and he's probably sleeping.
As soon as he calls, i will let you know.
I promise.
Well, here it is.
Immunity.
The evidence?
Anonymous source.
Provided information that ties you to the charges.
Pen?
You sure you don't want an attorney present?
Yeah.
Your pen.
This is wrong, as is this.
You said this would cover obstruction of justice and conspiracy, so I want that in writing, too.
That's blanket immunity.
You want someone to help take her down?
This is the only way I talk.
Congratulations.
You've each been chosen for my very first criminal-law clinic.
In here, you're not just students but actual practicing lawyers.
You finally get to be me.
 Thursdays on abc...
At least they chose a good photo.
...brace yourself for a mystery
 so killer...
This could destroy us all.
 ...not everyone is gonna
 make it out alive.
No!
 "How to get away with murder."
 Thursdays, 10:00, 9:00 central
 on abc.
What are you looking for?
It's right here.
Well, damn.
 13 seasons
 of fun.
Gimme, gimme, gimme.
 13 seasons of drama.
This act was a felony.
It was nice knowing you.
Shut up.
 13 seasons of twisty turns...
It's bad.
You're falling for me.
I slept with him.
 ...like only "grey's"
 can deliver.
Damn right.
 "Grey's anatomy."
 Thursdays on abc.

## S03E8

 Previously on "how to get away
 with murder"...
I'm poz.
Thomas isn't ready to date a poz guy.
You can always come to me.
You know that.
She won't notice.
It's Michaela.
Of course she will.
Whatever.
I'm a drunk mother.
I see Nico and grace twice a week -- supervised visits.
I know the best family attorney in the city.
Thanks.
Any chance you saw this man?
You need to look into someone's eyes to know whether or not they're telling the truth.
I saw him.
Charles mahoney has an alibi.
 My team was able
 to uncover evidence
 concretely placing Charles
 at a location
 far from the shooting.
Get out.
Get out!
Good night.
Love you.
Really?
That's blanket immunity.
You want someone to help take her down?
This is the only way I talk.
An anonymous source.
That's all they would tell me.
Is it you?
Look me in the eye and say it's not.
Then I can move on.
It's not me.
I'm done, Bonnie.
I'm done.
I could get through it before because I thought it would end, so...
But I can't...Do it anymore.
I'm tired.
I'll find out who it is.
Okay?
Annalise.
Annalise. Wake up.
Wake up.
What time is it?
Frank's back.
So, you love him?
Like a...
Brotherly, "we've been through a lot together," kind of love, or...
The real kind?
Why are you here?
That not obvious?
I need you.
What about when I needed you, huh?
When I called you over and over again.
I didn't want to involve you.
Oh, and you're fine involving me now?!
'Cause I'm in love with you.
Oh, my god. Stop!
You know i always have been.
No.
You know, i don't know anything about you!
You do.
You were in jail and you never told me.
I had to hear it from your father.
I'm sorry for that.
I don't care.
Just leave.
No.
Get out right now.
I got nowhere else to go.
You have yourself to blame for that, frank!
I know. Okay?
And I get it.
Just...
I'm scared what I'll do if I got to be alone tonight.
It's Bonnie.
Answer it.
Hi.
Is he there?
 Laurel.
Yes.
Are you safe?
Yes.
 Are you sure?
I'm fine.
Good.
You tell that bastard that if he comes anywhere near this house,
I'll shoot him.
Tell him, Laurel.
I need to hear you say it.
He just wants to talk.
Is that Annalise?
Give me the phone.
No, he doesn't get to talk to me.
Give me the phone,
Laurel.
Keep him there or he's dead.
What'd she say?
I'm going over there.
Frank, please, stop.
Frank, please.
I said stop.
She said she'd kill you.
Would that really be so bad?
You say you love me, right?
Then come back inside.
It was the fastest hookup of my life.
That happened on top of my $400 duvet.
I'll wash it tonight.
No, you'll buy me a new one.
Or better, get an apartment where you can soil your own linens.
Wait, soil as in, like...
You're obsessed with gay sex.
No, I just find it interesting.
Also, can we take a moment to enjoy the fact that I get to cross gay wedding off my bucket list again?
It was just sex. Relax.
It wasn't just sex.
It was sex with a boy that broke your heart.
Thank god I know how to separate sex from feelings.
Even with Oliver?
Whoa.
Your mom's calling.
You're driving.
Why?
So Asher and I can screw in your back seat and leave you to clean it up.
Yes, please.
I thought all you young people were addicted to your phones.
My battery died.
What's wrong?
You just received your first subpoena.
It's a closed hearing.
I have to take the stand and say I saw Charles that night.
Are you surprised?
His lawyer's trying to get your testimony thrown out before the trial.
They can do that?
If they present a solid alibi -- his cell records, security footage.
An actual person that he's paid off to say that they were with him.
It's what you said.
I can just claim I saw a guy who looked like Charles.
So he goes free and the prosecutor looks into your life?
Then what do we do?
Find the alibi.
How?
Tell me.
Where is he?
Oh, sorry.
What's up?
Annalise needs your help.
He was there all night?
Yeah.
Why didn't you call me?
I didn't want to worry you.
Now I am worried.
Why?
Oh, my god.
Tell me nothing happened.
Of course nothing happened!
You have to trust me right now.
I do.
I just...
I don't trust him.
No one does.
Annalise does.
Otherwise, why is she using him to help us?
Because she is protecting you.
Okay? That's all any of us want.
What?
Did you tell him about us?
No, I don't care what he thinks.
How is Charles doing in prison?
Why haven't you released the name of his alibi?
I never said his alibi was a person.
So -- so it's not a person?
You'll know more after tomorrow's hearing.
It'll be worth the wait.
It's a 24-hour bug.
She'll be back in class tomorrow.
Thank you.
Frank?
He'll call once he finds something.
What?
You have a better plan?
Exactly.
Is that him?
No.
President hargrove's office.
Divorce papers.
Raul served me here yesterday.
He wants full custody, the house, spousal support, and if I don't comply, he's threatening to take things public.
Didn't I give you
Nina's number?
She said the fact that I pled guilty to reckless endangerment of my kids makes it nearly impossible to challenge this.
You pled guilty?
In order to keep the file sealed.
I didn't want the board to find out.
'Cause you're afraid you would be judged by one mistake instead of the entirety of your hard-fought career.
What do you need?
Tell me what you would do.
If Nina's as good as you say and even she thinks i should settle...
You'll defend me if I kill him?
Mm.
All right,
I'll read this and see if I can find an alternative.
Thank you.
Hey, oli.
I got you a present.
Just a little something to show you how much I care.
Uh...
I'm kidding.
I told the delivery guy
I'd bring them to you.
Aww, you got bae flowers.
That's so sweet.
Those aren't from me.
Secret admirer?
Thomas.
"I know this probably won't work, but I'm begging for another chance.
A million ironic sorries --
Thomas."
Yeah, he's right.
It won't work.
Hey, since Annalise is sick, do you maybe want to go...
Go fishing?
Go spelunking?
What?
Yeah, spelunking you sounds perfect.
Connor, we have to go.
I think I'm gonna skip arbitration.
Bonnie needs us at the house.
Is something going on?
Sure that Annalise just wants to yell at us some more.
I'll come by later?
Yeah, sure.
You're having feelings.
Stop it.
Sucks, right?
You can penetrate him, but never their inner circle.
Frank's the one that started this!
I know, and now he's going to help us get out of it.
Do you have any idea how insane you sound right now?
No one is saying all is forgiven.
That's exactly what you're saying.
Yeah, it's good to know, actually, that we're allowed to shoot each other's fathers and still get to stay in the cult.
You're missing the point.
Do not stick up for your boy toy right now.
Seriously, you guys probably went on some murder spree and -- and banged on top of a corpse.
Okay, can we all just focus on what's important right now?
Finding the alibi.
If anyone can do that, it's the beard.
He doesn't have a beard anymore.
What?
We need to stall the hearing so frank has time to find the alibi.
Fine.
Do it.
We're in the middle of midterms.
Yeah.
He was the one stupid enough to lie to the police.
He can save his own ass for once.
Asher.
Wes needs our help.
Don't come crying to me when you fail out.
Or die.
You never know around here.
Does frank really not have a beard?
Think of stall tactics -- grounds to challenge the subpoena or a motion to disclose the alibi.
Uh, oli could hack the mahoneys' lawyer.
Or I could call my father.
He could track their phone calls.
Frank is finding the alibi.
We need to focus on ways to delay the hearing.
How about my medical records from when I was at the psych ward?
If Charles' lawyers knew, they'd want me to do a psych eval before I testify.
No, we're not giving your medical records to the people who want to discredit you.
It buys us time.
Go.
Room 512.
You want to change your life, or are you happy just to stay
Annalise keating's bitch?
If they're meeting this close to the hearing, she has to be the alibi.
Who is she?
Frank said she worked for the family during Charles' first trial.
What?
She's the one who gave frank the money.
I told him to follow her.
If we want him to take care of it...
She took your son from you, Annalise.
They don't mean it,
Connor and Michaela.
They're just scared.
It's fine.
The only person whose opinion i care about is right here.
So, I was right.
If she's the reason that you wanted to break up, you should've just said that.
No, meggy, it happened after -- please.
Mr. gibbins.
Your records.
Um...I was a patient here last year.
I don't care.
Just go.
What?
Uh, nothing.
Just last I heard, uh, frank killed Wes' dad, and now he's working for a.K. Again, so do we like frank -- do we not?
I'm just kind of lost.
Go home.
Study for your midterms.
No.
I'm all about the team.
"We're ducks, and ducks fly together."
It's "mighty ducks."
It's a great movie.
Asher, I'm telling you,
Michaela and Connor weren't wrong to leave.
Bonbon, if something bad's about to happen -- something bad's always about to happen in this house.
Go home.
You got your medical records?
Yeah.
Messenger just dropped this off.
No sender.
The mahoneys filed a motion challenging Wes' competency as a witness.
Hearing was pushed today so Wes can sit for a psych eval before he testifies.
And you're telling me this why?
Because I know you slipped the defense his medical records.
That's quite an accusation.
I'll keep this one to myself.
But any more interference on my case, and I'll have to report it to the disciplinary board.
As long as you're okay with me reporting that you broke privilege by telling me your client has mental-health issues.
We both want to protect the boy.
Let me do that.
Is frank still watching her?
Tell him to do nothing.
I mean it.
If he hurts anyone else,
I'll turn us all in.
Annalise slapped a judge this time, and she needs to blackmail him?
Or -- or she -- she killed Nate, and she needs you all to help lift his incredibly buff body?
Or she -- or we don't talk about Annalise while your penis is staring at me.
Sorry.
I'm flattered.
It's been what -- like 10 minutes?
Is it about Wes?
Oh, my god.
Because he's been missing a lot of class lately.
Do you want to know the truth?
Wes and Annalise are working some crazy court case in New York.
She asked for our help, and I said no for once, because I'm working really hard at...You know, trying to stay in the bubble of -- of work and school and...You know, this.
Turn around.
What's the court case about?
Because, I mean, if Wes needs our help for him -- oli.
He has enough people worrying about him.
Otherwise Annalise would've called you and made you go over there today, too, but she didn't, so...
Or that's her right now.
You already have
Thomas' photo on your phone?
That's before I realized he's a jerk.
Clearly doesn't know when to quit.
I don't blame him.
He got a taste, and now he wants seconds.
Just like me.
Okay, bossy pants.
Look, you're the one raring to go down there.
I'm just --
I'm being helpful.
We found a way to help Wes.
How nice.
Yeah, if we don't get arrested or killed first.
That would be bad.
Okay.
How can you focus on school right now?
You're a sensitive person, so you care about Wes, what happens to him.
Yeah.
You're only that way because you grew up in a family that was nice to you.
That's not an accurate statement about my parents, and what are you saying?
That it's your parents' fault that you're...Being cold?
I'm not cold.
I'm putting myself first.
Okay.
Is that something your mom taught you, to put yourself first?
Okay.
What do you want to know?
Everything.
But first thing is, why did she call?
I don't know.
I deleted the voicemail.
Our relationship is complicated.
Like my dad and me?
This is different.
Is it?
'Cause, you know, sometimes I wish that he would leave me a voicemail, but, oh, right, he's dead.
If I pick up the phone, she's gonna ask me for money, or to give legal advice to some meth-y cousin
I never even knew I had.
Or maybe she's dying of cancer and just wants to say goodbye.
I said goodbye...
A long time ago.
Now...Can I go back to studying, or do you want to keep annoying me?
I'm good.
Wouldn't mind a little head rub, though.
The big one -- head.
Mmm.
Do you ever think about hurting yourself?
No.
Have you ever intentionally caused physical harm to another person?
No.
Have you ever heard voices that others can't hear?
Are you gonna take frank back?
So, that's a yes.
I didn't say that.
Didn't say no.
No.
I don't believe you.
Well, that's your right.
He's responsible for you losing your baby.
And you killed Sam!
I'm tired.
So am I.
How's Laurel?
Did she tell you?
She didn't need to.
I'm glad you have her.
Me too.
Night.
I'm going to bed.
Annalise.
It's frank.
Put it on speaker.
Hey.
Check your e-mail.
Frank, where are you?
 In her house.
Her name's Lisa Cameron.
She's got a kid --
Madison.
I sent you some photos.
You need to leave.
This is what Annalise needs, bon.
Frank.
It's an eye for an eye.
Frank, if you go anywhere near that woman or her child,
I'll send the police right to your ass.
Annalise.
You hear me?
No more blood.
Promise me, frank.
I want two stories.
Mommy will do her best, but I get to pick which ones.
Frank?
No.
Hey.
You promised two stories.
Oookay.
We'll finish this one, and then it's to bed for both of us.
So, "he huffed and he puffed and he puffed and he huffed, and at last, he blew the house down.
The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks."
Annalise, I need you to stay calm.
Is he dead?
Is he dead?
Take him!
What?
Munchies?
Menopause.
Mm.
Will that be all?
Ma'am?
Hello?
Hey.
 Where are you?
I just snuck out.
I didn't do anything.
Tell Annalise.
 Bon?
Go back inside.
 You were right.
 This is what she needs.
Frank?
Is that him?
He left. They're fine.
Good.
Here's an actual fix.
I'm a court-ordered psychologist.
This is a non-confidential evaluation, which means i am legally bound to report my findings to all parties involved.
Your attorney is present to advise you of any legal ramifications of certain questions.
Understood?
Yes.
Good.
Have you ever wanted to hurt someone?
Physically? No.
Just emotionally?
We all get mad at people.
I'd say that's pretty normal.
Do you always tell the truth?
That'd be impossible.
Did you tell the truth about seeing Charles mahoney on the street that night?
Yes, I would never lie about something as important as that.
Do you feel like you have a good support system in place?
I do.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I just need to talk about Wes.
Yeah, he, uh, told me you knew.
It's our lives, and you can only have so much say.
Laurel, I'm happy for the two of you.
I just need your help.
On a scale of 1 to 10,
10 being the highest, how would you rate this support system?
10.
I've never felt more cared for in my life.
Annalise send you?
No.
I heard you're working for the d.A. Now.
I'm not getting involved with whatever this is.
Even if it's for Wes?
Please.
He's in trouble.
That concludes the evaluation.
Any questions for me, Wes?
Did I pass?
How'd it go?
I've been cleared to testify.
Yeah!
I knew our boy wasn't cray-cray.
The state calls Wes gibbins to the stand.
Please raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Why did you approach
Wallace mahoney that night?
I was lost.
I needed directions.
Did you see anyone before you crossed the street?
Yes.
He's the gentleman sitting right there.
Let the record show that the witness has identified the defendant,
Charles mahoney, as being present at the scene just prior to the shooting.
No further questions.
Mr. gibbins, you said you were lost that night.
Is it possible this is because you were disoriented?
No.
But isn't it true you were placed on a psychiatric hold due to exhaustion just months before winding up at the scene of this crime?
Objection.
The witness passed psychological evaluation.
Challenging recollection, your honor.
I'll allow it.
Don't you think your mental-health issues might've confused you as to what you saw that night?
No, I know what I saw.
It was him.
What's driving you to tell this lie, Mr. gibbins?
Objection.
Compound and argumentative.
My client has an alibi.
There are no phone records or surveillance footage placing him at the scene.
Only you -- a law student who happened to get lost at just the right time.
Counsel's testifying, your honor.
Sustained.
Are you working with someone who wants to take my client down?
Ms. Benton.
Or perhaps you're part of a plan to shoot and murder my client's father in cold blood.
Ms. Benton!
Keep going like this, and I will...
Send this case to trial right now and censure you so you are unable to represent your client...
He did great.
You'd be proud.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
No, he'd call you himself, but Vince won't leave his side.
It's fine -- just call me when you know something.
 Laurel?
Recess is over.
I'll call you after.
So...?
Nina was right.
It's a loser case.
Please, don't hold back.
But there's a way to fix it.
You appeal the child-endangerment plea.
My alcohol level was off the charts.
I didn't say it was gonna be easy.
Easy is different than impossible.
You know what?
I'm guessing you didn't get to this office by quitting every time a man told you, "no."
This is about my kids.
If giving him my money lets me have them back -- with two visits a month, supervised by a social worker who sees you as the enemy?
You fight this, especially if your children mean as much as you say they do.
Of course they do.
Then why ain't you fighting?
I am.
No, you're not.
You're calling me to your office to cry for help.
That's not a mother anyone would want.
They want a beast.
You have that.
You're just letting this one man beat it out of you.
Is that what your husband did to you?
A lot of men.
I'll take this case if you want.
No, that's -- you don't -- what?
You think you can do better?
How did you meet
Charles mahoney?
At an investment-banking conference earlier this year.
That's when you two started sleeping together?
Yes, we would meet once or twice a week at my home.
What time did Charles come to your house on the day that his father was murdered?
Around 9:00.
Did your daughter see him?
No.
Because he wasn't there?
Because I don't introduce my daughter to men
I'm not serious with.
When's the last time you spoke with Charles?
Before he was arrested.
Has there been any contact since?
No.
Nothing at all?
As I said, no.
Then explain the call you made yesterday from your home to Charles in prison.
Munchies?
Here's an actual fix.
I'm not getting involved with whatever this is.
Even if it's for Wes?
Please.
He's in trouble.
This is Nate lahey --
I'm an investigator in the Philly d.A.'S office.
Be quick -- I'm about to head into court.
 We got a suspect here who says
 your guy up at rikers,
 Charles mahoney,
 has a burner in his cell.
Hello?
 Hello?
 Who is this?
That is your home phone number, isn't it?
Yes.
Assumes facts not in evidence.
Here's the burner phone recovered from Mr. mahoney's cell, along with records corroborating the incoming call came from the defendant's home.
Ms. Cameron, did the mahoneys pay you to lie on the stand today?
Objection!
Badgering the witness!
Overruled.
Answer the question.
No.
Really?
Oh, so your daughter made the call to Charles, or more likely, you snuck a burner into his cell so that you could get your story straight today.
Judge, the defense requests a chain of custody hearing to determine the veracity of these claims.
Why?
We have an eyewitness that places your client at the scene of the crime, his fingerprints on the murder weapon, not to mention a financial motive that exceeds $25 billion.
Please, your honor.
Let's not waste any more taxpayer money.
Just months ago, a maniac with a gun took away the love of my life.
I have never felt such grief until today, when I realized
I might lose my only son,
Charles, as well.
As a mother, I feel helpless watching my son be persecuted for a crime he did not commit.
 As a citizen, I feel anger
 towards the system
 that allows innocent people...
What you reading?
 ...to be
 wrongfully imprisoned.
Just the news.
Let's eat.
What?
If I hacked your laptop, would I find out that you're actually reading about Wes' court case?
Did you not hear me when I said that I wanted to stay in the bubble?
Yeah, I did.
Uh, I just don't believe you.
Come on, like you all aren't hiding a ton of crap from me.
I've always been honest with you about how there are certain things I can't tell you for your own protection.
Oh, boy, that line again.
You're kidding me.
All I've ever done is tell you to stay away from Annalise, but, instead, your dumb ass begged her for a job.
Here we go.
Been -- what? --
Like three nice days, and I'm already remembering why we broke up in the first place.
You said that you broke up with me because you needed time to yourself.
Was that a lie?
No.
Then how does this have anything to do with why you dumped me?
Because you've never been totally honest with me.
'Cause this is bigger than me.
Look...
If you're so curious, why don't you go ask Annalise?
Oh, so this is
Annalise's fault now?
Yes!
No! No!
You are the one choosing to not tell me about the stuff going on about Wes!
Because it's not my place.
Maybe it's because you're afraid that I'll really know who you are and not like him.
You do know me.
Parts of you, but guess what, Connor --
I want to know everything about the guy that I'm with -- the good and the bad -- that's what love is.
No, I think love is letting a guy stomp on your heart and still being there for him when another guy rejects him!
Oh, you think that letting me cry on your shoulder is proof that you love me?
Yes! Because I do.
No.
I think you only love the idea of me.
No, I love you.
Like I'm some security blanket that you wrap around yourself every time things get too intense with Annalise.
That's not true.
And that -- that's not real love.
That is just some severe, messed-up emotional damage that you've been carrying around with you since the day I met you.
Is that what you think of me?
That I'm damaged?
I kept telling myself that I was the jerk this whole time.
Connor.
Connor!
Think frank might stop by?
Don't joke about that.
You don't think i could take him?
You're worried.
Of course.
Don't be.
Today was a good day.
And tomorrow?
Let's not think about that.
Come here.
I've got you.
What?
You're always looking out for me.
Now it's my turn.
I got you.
Well, I've got myself.
Thank you very much.
I know...
But I'm gonna be there, too.
He in there?
Go home.
No.
You had your time with him, lied to my face about it.
This is my time.
Leave!
Thank you for seeing me.
Really?
If you're gonna screw Oliver, at least stay the night and give my couch a rest.
What's wrong?
I hate him.
I hate him so much!
Connor!
What the hell happened in here?
Hello?
I begged Sam to let me tell you.
Every day after we got back, you were just...
Locked up in that bedroom.
But...He wouldn't even let me in the house.
He knew me so well, knew how to make me do what he wanted.
And the more time went on, i thought maybe he was right.
You went back to work, got better.
I never got better.
You watched me suffer all those years.
You watched me think that I killed my boy.
You watched Sam and i fall apart.
And you said nothing.
Sam wouldn't let me.
Oh.
You had all those months to apologize, and all you can do is blame Sam.
You killed my son.
That was you.
And you had the nerve -- the nerve to stay in my life.
Make me trust you, take care of you.
I just want to fix this.
How can you do that?
Hmm?
How do you do that, frank?
You gonna erase it all?
Take everything away?
Give me my baby back?
I can try.
You can't.
I can.
Let me fix it.
What's taking you so long, huh?
Think I'm gonna feel guilty?
Because I won't.
I love you, Annalise.
Frank?
Don't.
Get out.
This just hurts her more.
You'll do this for me.
This isn't what she wants.
This is exactly what I want.
You made your point!
Pull that trigger!
She can't survive this.
Pull it! Do it!
I can't survive this.
Pull the trigger!
Please don't, frank!
Do it! Pull it!
Please don't do it!
Do it! Do it for me!
Don't, please! Don't!
Don't do it!
Pull it! Do it!
Do it! Do it!
Don't!
Do it!
Don't!
Do it! Do it!
Don't!
Do it! Do it!
No!
Bonnie. Bonnie, thank god.
Why haven't you been answering your phone?
What the hell happened?
Someone went to the police.
-What are you talking about?
-What?
Annalise was arrested because of an anonymous source.
Annalise called everyone over to the house.
Did you know about that?
She didn't do this.
Then why did she lie to my face?
She said she didn't know if somebody died in the fire, but she did, didn't she?
What are you talking about?
It's all over the news. There's an unidentified male body.
Oh, my god, you know who it is.
You're not telling me because it's Connor, right?
I swear to god, if you lie to us right now,
I'll go to the police.
Just tell us who it is!
Is Connor dead?
Please just tell us.
Just tell me, please.
Oops. Sorry about that.
It happens.
Can it, uh...
Happen again?
Congratulations.
You've each been chosen for my very first criminal-law clinic.
In here, you're not just students but actual practicing lawyers.
You finally get to be me.

## S03E9

Previously on "How To Get
Away With Murder"...
- Why did she call?
- I don't know. I deleted the voicemail.
Hello?
You've never been totally honest with me.
'Cause this is bigger than me.
Maybe it's because you're afraid that I'll really know who you are and not like him.
I just want to fix this.
You gonna erase it all?
Take everything away?
- This isn't what she wants.
- This is exactly what I want.
Don't, Frank!
- Do it! Pull it!
- Please don't! Don't!
- Do it for me!
- Please don't!
Welcome to your midterm exam.
Before each of you is a case file for your client...
Ted Bundy.
It's 1989, and he's weeks away from the electric chair for the violent murder of 30 young women.
You'll each get one minute to convince me, the Chief Justice of the
Florida Supreme Court, to overturn his death sentence.
Does Mr. Bundy, an infamous serial killer, rapist, and necrophile, deserve to live?
You better convince me he does, otherwise this sociopath dies on your watch.
Sam was wrong about you, Frank.
- She doesn't mean any of this...
- You're a sociopath.
That's all you'll ever be... sick and depraved.
It's time for you to go.
Ms. Castillo?
You gave me the Automatic "A."
That doesn't mean you're excused.
Come on. Tell me why Mr. Bundy's life is worth saving.
You know who you are deep down inside.
That's why you bought that gun, right?
So you could do something good for once.
This is your chance.
Mr. Bundy suffers from mental-health issues.
And mental-health issues are often caused by chemical imbalances in the brain.
Look at me, Frank. Only me.
This only makes it worse for her.
I can handle it.
She's saying this because she's hurt.
We can't let emotions blind us to the fact that the death penalty is ineffective as a deterrent.
Current estimates state that one out of every 25 inmates on death row is innocent.
If you do this, you're making her a killer.
It's what she wants.
- It's not.
- It is.
She knows this was Sam.
Sam didn't kill anyone. It was you!
Do any of us want to live in a society that doesn't allow second chances? No.
Let us dedicate our energy to caring for this man instead of killing him.
- I need you here, Frank.
- She's playing you!
No, you were there.
That night meant everything to me.
You deserve better than me.
My client's charming and charismatic on the outside.
But inside he's a ball of repressed pain.
I'll die if you do this.
So please don't.
Don't.
You know me.
More than anyone.
So if I lose you...
Live for me. Please?
You love me, right?
You might not be able to say it... but you love me.
You love me.
You love me.
You love me.
I'm so sorry.
You should've done it.
How'd you pull all that science psychobabble out of your ass?
I'm smart.
Or you grew up in a psych ward.
That too.
My mother.
Here we are. Your grades.
For the first time in the history of my teaching career... you all passed.
Hell, yeah! Unh! Hit me, people!
Except you.
Here's some champagne.
You all earned it.
It's expensive, too.
You're not staying?
Yeah, come on, Professor
Keating. Let's get wild.
You couldn't handle it.
Whoo!
96, bitches! Ha-ha!
Hey, Oli, give me my own bottle.
Everything okay?
Frank's gone.
What does that mean?
Just what I said.
Yeah. "Gone" can mean a lot of things.
Not that type of gone.
Meaning he won't bother us anymore. You have my word.
So, go.
Celebrate with Laurel, have a drink.
Have 10. One of us has to.
DJ Hamie-hampton on the turntables, baby, baby!
Ah, enough with the gay stereotypes.
I need a play...
Hey. S-Saw you got a 91 on the exam.
I was impressed actually.
I... You're gonna make a great lawyer someday.
You mean for someone so damaged?
I regret saying that.
Don't.
I'd rather be damaged than fake.
Oh, Simon, hit me.
Ah, don't you think maybe you've had enough to drink?
Do not try to monitor me like one of your little freshmen.
I just don't think that now is the best time for getting crunk.
Oh. It's the perfect time.
Your mom's heading to your house right now.
She called your phone the other night, and I picked up.
You picked up a call from the mom she hates?
I tried to tell her it wasn't a good time 'cause of exams.
And then she said she'd send you exactly what you need, and I thought it was gonna be flowers or a huggy bear or something.
So I gave her your address, but it turns out she was just sending herself!
Are you having a stroke?
You lost weight?
Gained.
Get some good-good last night?
I wish.
Well, whatever you're doing, keep doing it, 'cause you are glowing.
Junk food is all I'm doing.
I had to trade in vodka for cake.
Had to?
Got in a little trouble.
I knew you had problems.
Didn't know this was one of them.
That's why they call it functioning alcoholic.
Well, still, quittin' looks good on you.
'Cause when you look good, you feel good.
And when you feel good, you...
Oh, what'd I say?
It's not you. It's just...
It's too damn quiet in here.
Where's Yvonne's big mouth when you...
Sorry.
Don't.
You're getting clean.
This is what happens.
The feelings you've been drowning in booze starting to coming up all ugly and loud.
Which is why I'm now trying to bury them in food.
Well, come here instead.
You know, sit in my chair, let the snotty tears come.
I've seen worse.
If you're gonna fall off the wagon, give me a call.
I'll bring the coke, you bring the Henny.
Shut your mouth.
Where did he go?
I don't know.
Did you ask her?
- No.
- Why not?
You're saying we're just supposed to believe her?
Or assume she killed him and we're all fine with that?
I kind of would be fine with that.
What?
He knows about us.
You told me he didn't.
I know. I just...
I didn't want you to freak out before you had to testify.
Wes!
Now, you know I love a black woman who has her money on point, but I'm gonna need you to stop bringing these
$100 bills up in here.
Last time, I swear.
Oh, and good lookin' out on the referral.
Thought your friend's bourgie ass had stumbled into the wrong place till she said you recommended me.
- My friend?
- She seemed to know you pretty well.
Or want to know you.
To be honest, I got a little
"single black female" vibe.
Pretty, brown-skinned, natural hair?
3c curly.
Looks good on her actually.
We both know that I've been unfairly aggressive in court, and I'm just here to make amends.
It's part of my recovery.
All's fair in the courtroom.
You know, as two of the very few black women in our field,
I think we need to be lifting each other up.
And not sleeping with each other's man.
Excuse me?
- This is about Nate.
- No.
You screwed him, and now I am.
That doesn't mean that we're required to engage in a cat fight.
I'm with you.
Then why are you here?
To make nice.
Hell, let's grab a cup of coffee sometime, Mani-pedis.
Maybe you can recommend a good salon for me.
Seems like I need to switch mine up.
- You've been investigating me.
- Please.
Maybe you're stalking me for some other reason?
I'm not stalking you.
You need to work on your poker game, girl...
- Okay.
- ...because everything that's going on...
- We're done here. - ...on your face right now confirms every suspicion
- I had coming in here.
- This meeting was a courtesy.
And, you know, the funniest part is picturing you going all "undercover" at Ro's thinking it was a good idea.
Get out!
You know, someone may take me down, but my ass if it's gonna be you.
What the hell is this?
Does it feel good?
Knowing that the only reason why you got this new job is because of me?
I don't know what that means.
And I don't care to.
Your new trick is investigating me.
That's why they hired you, right?
'Cause you know me so well.
You drunk right now?
I quit.
Then there's no excuse for how you're acting.
Tell me you had no part in this.
After all the illegal crap you dragged my ass into, you think I'm gonna rat on you?!
Why not? If they gave you immunity.
You're right. I'm gonna go upstairs and ask for that right now.
There he goes, signing up to be someone's bitch again.
You're the bitch!
- You sick, pathetic...
- Keep walking!
Is this really how you want to be? Huh?
The hood chick causing a scene at her ex's work?
What other choice do I have?
You made your choice when you chased me away!
I thank you for that.
And being free of you woke me the hell up.
And I'm still a good-enough guy to come on down here and get an earful of your crazy.
But I'm done.
Get drunk, be sober.
Just keep your damn mess away from me.
How am I supposed to get better?
That's not my job.
Girl, bye.
Wow. Schmancy.
It's tiny, actually.
Oh, baby, it's nice.
Which makes sense, 'cause you always did like nice things.
Asher seems nice, too.
His picture surprised me.
I didn't know you like white boys.
How did you see his picture?
He sent me a selfie.
Unbelievable.
Don't be mad at him.
I totally bamboozled him into giving me your address, which I never should've had to do.
- What do you need?
- Huh?
You got on a plane, you're in my apartment, which means you need something.
What is it?
Well, uh...
I've got the cancer.
- Okay, I'm lying.
- I know.
Micky, I left your daddy.
So, if it's all right with you,
I might need a place to stay for just a few weeks.
Connor, you want some?
Can we please talk?
Not here.
I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to protect you.
Exactly. You have to stop that.
What?
Treating me like some charity case.
I'm not treating you like a chari...
You just admitted you lied to me
'cause you were worried
I'd freak out about Frank!
This is about Frank?!
No, it's not about Frank.
Then why are you trying to pick a fight right now?
- 'Cause I have a bad feeling.
- About?
That you're only with me
'cause you want to fix me.
- That's not true!
- It makes sense.
You've spent your whole life trying to fix your mom.
- And now what? It's my turn?
- My mom?
You know what? Don't worry about it.
No. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. So what you're saying is 'cause my mom's mentally ill, I am, too?
- No. That's not what I'm saying.
- 'Cause let's be clear.
Fixing people... that's more your issue than it is mine.
How?
You only fell for Rebecca 'cause she was some broken little bird that you just wanted to save!
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings?
I'm just trying to be honest.
- No, you're right. We shouldn't talk about this here.
- This is...
Did you two just have a lovers' quarrel?
Shut up.
Hello?
Don't get alarmed, but you need to come to the police station.
Why?
I'll explain in person, but it's important.
His attorney's calling him down here right now.
Good. Land him.
Call as soon as you get anything.
Sorry for barging in.
No, it's a nice surprise.
I would say let's grab a coffee, but I actually have my hands full right now.
Yeah, I heard.
Everything okay?
Did you only hire me so I'd help your investigation into Annalise?
So you do still talk to her.
So it is true?
Let me be clear.
This office is not investigating Annalise Keating.
And why I helped you get this job is because you deserve it.
We should end this.
Did you not just hear me?
I just think it's in both our best interests to stop before things get more... complicated.
- I thought it was you.
- Because I'm that guy?
Of course not.
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.
Why is your penis on a dead girl's phone?
Kill me. Kill me. Kill me!
You disgusting slut. I'm so sorry.
You're gonna die alone in this house.
You're nothing but a piece of ass.
Pull it! Do it for me!
Lila was six weeks pregnant.
You killed my son.
Is Frank here?
Good.
Not that it matters,
'cause we're all going to jail.
The D.A.'s office is investigating me.
So... get a glass.
You got some catching up to do.
Hey. It's Wes. You know what to do.
Where'd you go? I'm in the mood to fix you right now.
- Pizza's here!
- So just call me.
Hey, do you think it's a good idea for you to be getting wasted?
Yeah. Why? Do you have a problem with it?
No, not for me.
But I vaguely remember you showing up on my doorstep messed up the night of the bonfire with a substance-abuse problem.
You're cute.
What?
That you bought that.
What is that supposed to mean?
I wasn't high, Oli. I was traumatized.
Traumatized from what?
Like you don't already know.
Castillo! VÃ¡monos!
I just realized
I can't let some lazy, deadbeat man take my last remaining years.
You inspired me to be honest.
Okay, you need to go back home, tell Daddy you changed your mind and you want him back.
What?
Do you even have a bank account?
I can get one.
Exactly. Daddy knows how to take care of you.
That's not very P.C.
- Okay.
- Well, then, fine. Leave him.
But go ask one of your other children
- to sleep on their couch.
- All right, you do know that Violet is back on the Oxy, right?
And Odette is still with Dirty Durwood.
None of this is my problem!
Out of all of y'all,
I thought you'd be the one that would understand.
This is a big life decision for me!
I don't understand.
Or care, to be honest.
Beg the church to take you back or go sleep on the street, but I'm not gonna be the one to take care of you right now.
After all that I've given you?
What have you given me?
Everything in my life, I gave me.
Bull.
Look at your other children!
I'm the only one who's not a complete disaster.
You're pretty sure about that?
'Cause I think that richy-rich fiancÃ© left you.
Oh, my God. Get out!
Maybe you forgot about it, but I will never forget what it was like seeing you in that sorry-ass swamp shack, where we rescued you.
Social Services rescued me, then I rescued myself!
You just needed to feel good about yourself.
So, hey! Job well done!
You did your charity work, saved your little black baby.
And now I'm asking you to leave.
You ungrateful little ho.
Sorry. Hi. I tried to stop them.
Mama Pratt!
We're so excited to meet you!
Hi. I'm Laurel.
We brought you a little taste of Louisiana!
It happens all the time.
The D.A. gets your statement typed up, needs you to sign off that the wording's correct.
At least they're trying to save you the trip to New York.
So it's about the Mahoney trial?
Unless there's another reason the police want to talk to you.
This way.
Just take a bite.
What do you think they know?
I don't want to think about it.
Okay, but there are things we can do to prepare.
Oh.
I burned the files.
What?
You don't think that was good enough?
Is it true?
You sleep with him?
It didn't mean anything.
I'll make coffee.
One, two, three, shoot!
- I'm so sorry.
- Save it.
Oh, my God! Look at that trouser snake!
Uh, I probably shouldn't be on HumpR in front of you.
No, you shouldn't be.
I have raised four sons.
I have seen my share of dinglebirds before.
So, on this HumpR, do you have to be gay or is it breeders?
Gay. You scroll through the photos until you see one that you want and then you set up a date, and that's it.
Okay. Ooh, he's fine.
I like that. Look at that hot m...
Is that Thomas?
- What?!
- No!
Look. He contacted me.
What's the big deal?
Dude, bros before hoes!
Whatever.
We already talked about meeting up at Debriefed later.
- It's a gay bar.
- I want to go.
You should. That way, I can move out while you're gone.
Sure you can afford it? Just gonna move in and leech off another family till your spoiled little ass gets bored with them, too?
Or maybe I'll adopt a bunch of kids and collect the welfare checks.
Ain't worth it. Trust me.
Okay, I have an idea!
How about we take Connor to find a twink at my place and we can leave Michaela and
Mrs. Pratt to hang out alone?
Don't leave me.
It's time for bed.
Bonnie...
Just rest.
How long have you and Annalise Keating known each other?
Since I started taking her class.
Would you say you two are close?
We assumed this was about the Mahoney case.
What's the interest in my client's relationship with Annalise Keating?
We're looking into her possible involvement in a murder.
What's that have to do with my client?
That's what we're trying to figure out.
Tell us what this is, or we leave.
We'd like Wes to cooperate in an ongoing investigation.
An investigation into Professor Keating?
A body was found in the woods.
We got a DNA match to someone who was associated with Ms. Keating.
Now, you being a law student,
I'm sure you know how often a woman's murder is committed by her boyfriend.
You dated Rebecca Sutter.
Right?
Look, I don't need you to tell me what you know or what you allegedly did.
When you're offered immunity, you take it.
Wes, this is serious.
It's Annalise they're after here, not you.
You're fired.
She's gotten into your head.
I get how that could happen with someone of her stature, but now is the time to cut the cord.
Did you not hear me?
You're fired.
Someone make Detective again?
Investigator for the D.A., actually.
Impressive.
You working the Keating investigation?
We're being tight-lipped on this one.
Good to see you.
Bonnie?
The D.A. is investigating Annalise.
Frank?
You can fix this.
Take the fall.
So it was a lie, huh?
No.
You love me, but you want me to jump on the grenade for all of us?
I want us all to be safe.
Hey. It's Wes. You know what to do.
Wes, I need you to come to the house right away.
I'll explain in person, but... it's important.
H-Hello?
Where are you?
- The clinic.
- Okay.
Stay there. I'm coming to you.
Why? Is something wrong?
Annalise?
Hello?
Are you with Wes?
No, we had a fight.
Find him and get everyone to the house right away.
Why?
I'll explain to you in person.
Just hurry.
Okay, but we've been drinking your champagne all day and...
No, no, no, no.
It's an actual rap I wrote, and there's a video.
And it's called "Bye Felicia."
And it's on fleek!
Hey, we need to go.
No. We have to...
Annalise needs us at the house.
Where's Connor?
Probably boning some freshman.
And I don't think I can go anywhere, to be honest.
I can't feel my face.
Or my legs.
Or my penis.
Connor?!
Where are you?
Hey, I don't know if you have plans, but, uh, we could grab a bite.
There's a... There's a great sushi place downstairs actually.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry?
This was sex. Not a date.
Wow. Okay.
You know, you're much nicer on HumpR.
That's 'cause I wanted to get laid.
You know what?
You're the problem with the gay community.
You know, we all just treat each other like a piece of meat.
We're all the problem with the gay community.
It was nice meeting you.
Annalise?
Annalise?
Annalise?
Annalise?
I rely on you more than I should.
No, it...
Uh, I'm just happy to be here.
I know, but...
But... what?
I'm in trouble, Oliver.
We all are.
Connor, too.
But you can help.
Who do you want me to hack?
The D.A.'s Office.
Annalise?
Annalise, are you here?
Annalise?
Annalise, are you here?
- Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to step b...
- I live here!
- Step back!
- Please!
Ma'am, just calm down!
Calm down.
Who is it? Tell me! Tell me.
Hey! Hey...
- Here.
- What's this?
A plane ticket home. Your flight leaves at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.
Honey, we just had a little mother-daughter row.
Yeah, I don't really see it that way.
Well, how do you see it?
Is it us not talking anymore?
'Cause I'm not okay with that.
Baby, I messed up. I hate that I did it.
But I'm your mama and I love you.
I don't know what that means.
You don't know what love means?
Coming from you? No.
I have to study.
You know, your friends aren't your family, Micky.
They don't know you like we do.
You have never known me.
Annalise!
Let him through.
I heard someone say there was a body. Is it true?
No one knows anything yet.
Okay, but what if it's true?
Stop it. Let's not let our minds go there.
Wipe it clean.
Everything on it.
Ms. Keating, we're gonna have to do this right now.
Annalise Keating, you're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Here.
Look straight into the camera, please.
I want my phone call.
Hello?
I'll accept the charges.
Bonnie, I'm in jail.
What?
They arrested me.
For what?
Annalise called me from jail. Did you do it?
- Do what?
- The phone.
She sent me to find you.
It's clean.
Good. Follow me.
Hold up! Everybody quiet!
Rescue 1. Rescue 1. Priority.
Talk to me.
We have another occupant.
We're bringing them out now.
- Dr. Lowell.
- What?
I'm the med student. I was sent to get the lab results.
- Get to the point.
- She's pregnant.
Oh, my God.
I know her.
The official charge... arson and first-degree murder.
The evidence?
An anonymous source.
Is she gonna die?
Okay, you need to keep your voice down, okay?
I can get in a lot of trouble for even telling you this.
I just want to make sure she's okay. I'm sorry.
I know, and I promise you
I'm gonna tell you everything I can, okay?
H-Have you thought about contacting the others?
No. I want to make...
I wanted to make sure...
You should definitely call...
Hi.
- Laurel's at Middleton Hospital.
- I'm here.
Then get off the phone, find out how she is.
I know. I'm on it.
Please try to trust me.
I will if you find out what the hell they know.
Laurel's pregnant.
She gonna be okay?
Bonnie.
I have no idea.
This is Connor.
You should text me.
Connor, pick up, please.
Hello?
Who's this?
Trishelle. Who's this?
Oliver. Wh... I'm looking for Connor Walsh.
Is that whose phone this is?
I just found it in my daughter's sofa cushions.
Darn thing was vibrating my booty.
Mom!
Someone named Oliver looking for Connor.
I don't know where he is, Oliver.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, what's wrong?
- You haven't heard?
- Heard what?
Annalise's house burned down.
The cops arrested her.
An anonymous source.
That's all they would tell me.
Was it you?
Look me in the eye and say it's not.
Then I can move on.
It's not me.
It's Meggy.
It's Meggy, Laurel. You're okay.
What, what, what? What is it?
What?
Pen? This?
Mmm.
Okay, okay.
Here, here.
You reached Nate Lahey.
Leave a message.
Why am I getting calls about you hanging outside interrogation rooms?
I swear to god, Nate.
If you are still in contact with her...
Call me back!
- Bonnie! Thank God!
- What the hell happened?
Someone went to the police.
- What are you talking about?
- What?
Annalise was arrested because of an anonymous source.
Annalise called everyone over to the house. Did you know about that?
- She didn't do this.
- Then why did she lie to my face?
She said she didn't know if somebody died in the fire, but she did, didn't she?
- What are you talking about?
- It's all over the news.
There's an unidentified male body.
Oh, my God. You know who it is!
You're not telling me because it's Connor, right?
I swear to God, if you lie to us right now,
- I will go to the police.
- Just tell us who it is!
Is Connor dead?! Just tell me. Please.
Oli.
My God.
Who's dead?
Case number X-14-0522.
Dr. Bradfield speaking.
I've just completed an initial visual exam of the decedent.
Sex... male.
Age... undetermined.
Ethnicity... black.
The decedent shows extensive full-thickness thermal injuries with focal charring of the extremities.
Can I help you?
The D.A.'s Office. Can I take a look?
No. No.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No, no!
No, no!!
No!
No!!
Bonnie, who is it?
It's Wes.
What?
What?
What happened?
What happened?!
Do you know?
Did you... Did you...
Did you see him in the house?
Do you know what happened?
Do you know what happened to him?
No.
No!
You circling a cause of death yet?
Officially? No.
Unofficially?
Immunity.
This is wrong. As is this.
You said this would cover obstruction of justice and conspiracy, so I want that in writing, too.
That's blanket immunity.
You want someone to help take her down?
This is the only way I talk.
Wes, I need you to come to the house right away.
I'll explain in person, but...
it's important.
I didn't do this.
What is it?
Nate.
He was already dead, before the fire.

## S03E10

Previously on "How to Get
Away with Murder"...
Here.
A plane ticket home.
Your friends aren't your family, Micky.
I remember you showing up messed up the night of the bonfire.
I wasn't high, Oli.
I was traumatized.
Traumatized from what?
Like you don't already know.
Hello? Don't get alarmed, but you need to come to the police station.
His attorney's calling him down here right now.
Land him.
We'd like Wes to cooperate in an ongoing investigation.
A body was found in the woods.
Rebecca Sutter.
Here it is... immunity.
Wes, come to the house right away.
Annalise?
No, no!!
Wipe it clean.
Everything on it.
The official charge...
Arson and first-degree murder.
The evidence?
An anonymous source.
Laurel's pregnant.
- Who's dead?
- It's Wes.
He was already dead, before the fire.
I didn't do this.
You're not gonna let me get it at all?
No, you have to get it yourself.
I'm not gonna make it easy for you.
Hey!
Professor Keating.
I, uh...
I got that internship.
What internship?
To work with undocumented immigrants?
Oh, right.
You got it?
Yeah.
Oh.
I take it that's Meggy?
Yeah.
What?
She looks like she wants an introduction.
Oh.
Um...
That would be weird, right?
Uh, totally.
Just tell her I have a meeting.
Got it.
Hey.
Congratulations on the internship.
Thanks.
Keating.
Keating.
You're getting out of here.
I'm being released?
No, we're transferring you to county till your bail hearing.
Up and at 'em.
Tilt your head forward.
I'm gonna search your hair.
Open your mouth.
Your wrist.
These are yours and yours alone to take care of.
If you lose or destroy any property in your cell, you will receive a fine.
Hi.
Everyone's in the waiting area.
They want to see you, but the doctors would only let me in.
I told them I was your lawyer.
Oh.
Wes died before the fire.
The M.E. told me.
Did you see anything before the explosion?
Mm.
I know you're in pain, but the detectives will be here soon.
Good.
I want to tell them who did it.
Frank.
No.
Where is he, then?
I want to ask him to his face.
You know he would never hurt any of us.
Of course he would.
Leave.
If you tell the police, it will hurt all of us.
Leave, or I'll tell them everything.
How is she?
Okay.
Can we see her?
The doctor said she's too weak.
Does she remember anything?
No.
She's in shock.
I'll call Meggy, see if she can get us in.
Don't.
She needs to be with people right now.
She needs sleep.
Or you just don't want us to see her.
You're scared that we might find out what actually happened.
No one knows what happened.
The police seem pretty confident that this was Annalise.
Someone's framing her.
And this is not the place to talk about it.
Go home.
Take care of each other.
I will call you once I know anything.
Where are you going?
To see Annalise.
Just... Tell her
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
No.
You should come back with us.
I think I'm just gonna go home.
Ol, it's not healthy to be alone right now.
No, I... actually, I think that's exactly what I need, so...
Laurel thinks it was you.
And what do you think?
Just answer me.
You think I'd do this to Annalise?
After everything?
I don't know what to think anymore.
We know who did this.
It's the Mahoneys.
They must have found out
Wes is Wallace's son, that you knew him.
They have money to make whatever they need happen.
Annalise?
Doesn't matter who did it.
Only person locked up is me.
Your bail hearing is tomorrow at 2:00.
I called Helen Hughes.
She wants the case.
Eve would be a conflict of interest.
Everyone's a conflict of interest.
You have to do this.
No.
I will find someone you trust.
Bonnie.
You need the best.
We're under attack here.
It has to be you.
Are you sure?
I showed you.
No, I know, but what if it ripped when you were taking it off?
Yeah.
"Yeah" as in
"that's what happened"?
I don't know.
Come here.
I hate my genes.
I was on the pill when I was 17, but I turned into my mother...
Anxious, depressed.
I'm fine.
I just had my period, so...
Yeah, I'm just being paranoid.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
It is.
No, it's the condom manufacturer's fault.
Yeah, but if I wasn't so big, it never would've broke.
Come on.
That was funny.
It wasn't.
I thought it was.
It wasn't.
Hey.
Those detectives are here.
Could these drugs hurt the baby?
No.
They have you on Dilaudid because it's safe for pregnancy.
Send them in.
I walked in,
I didn't see anyone, so I looked in the kitchen.
That's when I saw that the basement door was open, so I went down there.
What did you see?
Um...
I just heard a... mm...
A noise coming from upstairs, and then I woke up here.
When professor Keating called you, did she say why she wanted you at the house?
You're trying to charge her with my attempted murder, right?
Annalise didn't do this.
Because you know who did?
Well, that's your job to figure out.
It's got to be Frank's, right?
He's only been back a week.
Yeah, well, it only takes one orgasm to make a baby.
Can we please stop talking about this, especially in front of my mom?
Why? You afraid she's gonna want to adopt it?
Mom?
Mom?
Michaela.
What does it say?
I'm sorry.
I told her to go.
Yeah, but that was before she knew anyone was dead.
She knew.
She's probably at the AirPort.
I-i can go grab her.
I don't...
I don't care.
Look, anyone would be upset by this.
I'm upset because our friend is dead, not because of that terrible woman.
Did you really just call
Waitlist your friend?
'Cause I kind of recall you hating him before he became barbecue.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Dibs on the second shower.
You not eating?
What, you trying to keep it tight for a conjugal, or you just afraid of needing to drop the kids off at the pool?
Look, you gonna pee, drop a deuce, get your period, have sex in front of us.
Sooner you get over it the better.
Mm!
Ahh.
See, it's easy.
It's no different than you alone in what I'm guessing is some big Ol', fancy crib...
Bitch, will you just leave her be?
Or do I need to drown you in your own piss?
So, you admit going to talk to Ms. Keating in her holding cell, and this is just an hour after you talked to the medical examiner?
Due to our prior relationship,
I felt she might disclose key evidence for us.
To be clear, you did this on your own.
No one in this office cleared you to do that?
No.
Well, Nate, I'm sorry, but we're gonna need to reassess your position here.
You tell him about us?
Nate.
That's a no.
We've been sleeping together.
I imagine any demotion might be construed as sexual harassment.
Grabbing a woman's ass is never okay.
I thought you were my girlfriend.
That's the best excuse you could come up with, baby trump?
Mm, it's not an excuse.
You look just like her.
You might know her...
Michaela Pratt?
I might know her
'cause she's black?
We all look alike?
No. No, no.
That's not what I meant.
So you're a racist
and a pervert.
H-how does that make me a racist?
I-I can understand a pervert, sure, but...
Wes.
Wes!
This is my friend Wes.
He'll tell you.
Doesn't she look exactly like Michaela?
Oh, my god.
You're just making this worse!
You do kind of look like her.
See?
Not a racist.
Come anywhere near me again, and I report you to the police.
You think that was racist, don't you?
I just think you're white.
Please don't tell Michaela.
Stop it.
Sorry.
How you doing?
I just need sleep.
I told you I want to be alone.
I know.
I just didn't know if you really meant that.
What's going on, Oli?
Annalise asked me to delete everything on her phone last night...
Before I knew Wes was dead.
That means she did this, right?
No.
You told Bonnie you thought she did it.
Yeah, I was wrong.
She's being framed.
Or maybe you're lying to me the same way you lied about the night of the bonfire.
Sam Keating went missing that night.
His remains were found a few weeks later.
Did you all do that?
Do you really want to know?
No, because the minute you tell me...
I'm guilty, too, right?
Of conspiracy to commit murder, obstruction of justice?
You could go to the police right now.
Nobody would blame you.
I just want to be by myself right now.
Oli, look, I'll stay.
We don't even need to talk.
Connor, please.
Okay.
Um...
I'll be at Michaela's.
Thanks for seeing me.
The autopsy report's not out yet.
I know, but you must have heard something...
I haven't.
I can't be telling you when I do.
Why'd you go to her last night if you don't want to help?
So I could look her in the eye and see if she did this.
She didn't.
You know that for a fact?
This is your shot to get on the right side of this.
I can take you upstairs, give you immunity.
You should go.
Don't call me again.
Visitor.
For who?
Her.
Your kids are here.
Oh, finally!
Hi.
I won't look.
Hey, you gave in!
Now you got a visitor.
Don't forget to wipe.
I pushed the bail hearing a day.
Why?
They still haven't released the autopsy reports, which we need if we want to challenge a bail denial.
Did you go to Nate?
We don't need Nate.
The M.E. will release the cause of death soon, and we're still looking for who the source is.
"We"?
Frank.
I don't want him anywhere near this.
He's not.
I promise.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Tell me you found something.
Call log from the station last night...
Every call made or received.
Best I could do.
What's wrong?
She needs a real lawyer.
What would Sam say right now?
You're as good as Annalise.
Let's go.
Did you call your parents?
Do you want me to call them?
Mm, they'll just make it worse.
Bonbon said the police will be stopping by.
Yeah, they were here.
They wanted me to tell them it was Annalise.
Did you?
No.
Why not?
Annalise wouldn't hurt Wes.
She would if he was gonna turn her in.
She probably had Frank do it.
Connor.
And you're just protecting Frank
'cause the baby's his, right?
Shut your mouth right now.
Annalise wouldn't do this.
Then why did she have Oliver delete everything from her phone?
What are you talking about?
She told him to clear her phone before he knew that Wes was dead.
And now he might go to the police.
You have to stop him.
No.
Have you lost your mind?
We'll all go to jail!
How do you know that she didn't do this or that she's coming for one of us next?
It was the Mahoneys.
Wes testified against them.
How do we know this wasn't you?
What?
Where were you last night?
I was with Thomas.
I told you.
And he'll verify that?
Because you haven't seemed that upset by this.
Do you seriously think
I did this?
Wes is dead, and you're not upset at all!
Who's the person who started all this?
It's always been him.
Stop talking.
So, yeah.
Maybe part of me is relieved that he's gone.
Connor! He did kill someone, after all, so maybe this is just karma.
The baby is Wes'.
Well, you should just get an abortion now,
'cause Waitlist isn't the type of father you want for your child.
Asher!
Hit me!
Stop!
Do it! Hit me!
Asher!
Get off!
Get off of him!
Asher, what is wrong with you?!
Waitlist!
Aww.
You look like a picture straight out of a Middleton brochure.
You know, if they allowed killers in there.
What do you want?
I just like looking at you.
I have to study, Connor.
I just got out of therapy.
It's the first time
I've been back since I was 17 and needed to talk through all my gay stuff.
Now I just need to talk through
All my murder stuff.
I'm kidding.
I talked about Oliver the whole time.
It's lame, I know.
He just needs space.
How do you know?
He got really drunk at my birthday party the other night and told Meggy.
We should let them go, right?
Like, if we were at all good people, we'd want them to be free of us.
Maybe.
What did you do to him?
I-I assume there's a reason that he went all frat boy on you.
I said something stupid.
Grief makes people do stupid things.
How are you?
I don't know.
I can't even look at you right now.
Is that what you were like when you ran over Sinclair?
You've got some crazy rage problems or something?
I'm just upset.
We're all upset!
You don't seem that sad.
I'm sad.
I'm just not crying about it every second like you.
Okay, but what about when your mom left?
That clearly hurt you...
We're dealing with your mess right now, not mine.
We're all a mess right now!
That's the point!
And maybe
I'm supposed to hide that or pretend that I'm some unfeeling jerk, but... Wes is dead.
That doesn't mean you get to act like an animal.
Go home.
What?
I'm staying here with Laurel to make sure you didn't put her on suicide watch.
What?
Look at this number...
Where it came from.
Brookline, mass.
Hannah Keating called the police at 10:30 that night.
It was after the fire started.
I don't know how she could have found out about it so soon unless she knew it was going to happen.
Or she was working with the Mahoneys.
It seems insane, I know, but she's always wanted the house, and she'd know that hurting Wes would hurt you.
I called her.
Automated voice-mail box for...
Hannah Keating.
You always hated my black ass living in your mommy and daddy's house.
So take it, Hannah.
I'm done with it.
Not like anything good happened to me since the minute
I moved in here.
That's not enough to incriminate you.
She thinks I killed Sam, so she'll say whatever it takes to ruin me.
She finally won.
It just took me helping her.
Shopping for Meggy?
You feel bad you dumped her and think tacky jewelry will win her back?
No.
Then who's it for?
Do not say Annalise.
No. God.
Laurel.
Don't tell anyone.
Why not?
The same reason you didn't want to tell us about Asher.
Because I was embarrassed of him.
Which makes sense if you're Laurel in this situation, but you...
Mm.
You're worried
Frank's gonna find out.
He'll kill you.
You know that?
We're happy.
I just... Don't want to ruin that.
I won't tell anyone.
Thanks.
But I do not approve.
You broke up with Meggy like five minutes ago, and now you're already buying jewelry for some other girl?
It's not just some other girl.
I'm just saying, maybe you need to be alone for a second.
How would you know what I need?
This is the most we've ever talked.
Well...
It's not like you come talk to me, either.
How much can you spend?
'Cause our girl's rich, and she'll know if you cheap out.
Your nurses are no joke.
They won't give up the pain meds.
Should I get ice chips?
I could read you a conlaw brief.
That should put you right to sleep.
How's your mom?
Uh, she left.
Why?
It doesn't matter.
Please.
I need to be distracted.
Um...
I kicked her out.
It was before
I knew what happened.
Or I'm just a horrible person.
You're not.
I am.
Whatever you need or decide,
I'm here for you, okay?
Oh, press it.
It's green.
Automated voice-mail box for...
Hannah Keating.
So, take it, Hannah.
I'm done with it.
No, no!!
You burned a boy in your house.
Or that's... What
I heard the guards say.
Good thing you a lawyer.
I knew I'd seen your face before...
In court once, waiting on one of my cases.
You was wearing this badass red-leather jacket...
Had them Malaysian tracks flowing, guns out, screaming at that old-white-man D.A.
And I'm thinking,
"why can't this queen defend me?"
Jacked up, ain't it?
No matter how high or how far we climb, they gonna find a way to pull us back down.
I have a plan.
If I compel them to disclose
Hannah as their source,
I can undermine her testimony completely.
She accused you of killing Sam.
It all speaks to her bias against you.
Tell me you think it's a good idea.
Whatever you think.
Due to the heinous nature of this crime, specifically the murder of Wesley Gibbins, we believe
Ms. Keating's release would pose a threat to the citizens of Philadelphia.
And with her financial resources...
We see little impeding her flight.
Therefore, the state strongly recommends your honor deny her bail.
Ms. Winterbottom?
Your honor, the state's evidence to support their allegations against my client is lacking, if not non-existent.
We aren't arguing the facts of this case today, your honor.
Any effort to deny my client bail must be based on credible evidence...
But the state's case is based on an anonymous source.
Objection.
Speculative.
My client was arrested before an autopsy of the victim could be conducted.
There's an independent basis for probable cause.
It's our right to ask that the source be identified to know whether there's any warrant to this case.
Mr. Denver, may I ask why you don't want to reveal this source?
We are protecting their safety, your honor.
Well, certainly there's additional evidence you could offer the court to prove that the defendant should remain in custody until the trial, otherwise I'm inclined to set bail.
Your honor, we would ask for a short recess so that we may discuss the matter internally?
15 minutes.
Oh, my god.
What happened?
I said some stuff
I shouldn't have.
Well, where is everyone?
Michaela's at the hospital.
Asher's at
Annalise's bail hearing.
And you didn't want to go?
I don't know what I want to happen to Annalise right now.
Because you think she did it?
I don't know.
Oli, you got to go to the police.
No.
You can tell them that you cleared her phone because she threatened you.
She didn't.
You can get immunity.
And what about you?
It doesn't matter.
I-I'm not just gonna go turn you in.
I'm gonna be fine, okay?
You're my life, Connor.
Well, you can find someone better!
Don't say that.
I slept with Thomas.
That's what I was doing last night.
I was... I was sleeping with him.
I... I wasn't at Asher's.
You still want to protect me?
Of course.
Oli.
You just slept with him to hurt me.
Yeah, and I'm gonna continue to hurt you.
It's... it's what I do.
It's who...
It's who I am.
It's who we all are.
We are bad people.
No.
No, you're not.
Look, I don't even care that Wes is dead.
I don't.
Honestly, I do...
I feel nothing.
I'm just broken and sick, and I need all of this to stop.
So, please...
Please, just do what I never could.
You're bleeding.
I...
You can end all this.
Just be quiet.
This is a question of safety, your honor, which is why we cannot reveal the identity of our source.
However, we are prepared to disclose an additional piece of evidence at this time.
Ms. Atwood.
Your honor,
I've been running point on an investigation into Annalise Keating's potential involvement in a number of unsolved crimes.
We approached Wesley Gibbins with an immunity deal in exchange for his cooperation in building the case against her.
Mr. Gibbins did not sign the immunity deal, but you can see he made notations which prove he was about to accept the terms.
Unfortunately, he left the station and, in just a few hours, was killed in a fire.
We proffer that Mr. Gibbins went to Ms. Keating's, told her about the investigation, which is why she killed him.
Your honor, there are other suspects the D.A.'s office is refusing to look into.
Furthermore, our investigation...
The victim was an eyewitness in the Charles Mahoney murder trial.
All the evidence points to Ms. Keating.
Clearly, the Mahoney family had motive to kill Mr. Gibbins.
Ms. Winterbottom, you asked for more evidence.
This is it.
But, your honor...
I'm denying Ms. Keating's request for bail and ordering that she be remanded to Philadelphia county prison to await trial.
Wes didn't sign the deal.
That means we can challenge the theory of motive. Bonnie.
If that's all they have, I'll get it thrown out. Didn't you hear them?
It's just the beginning.
You did your best.
Good afternoon.
On behalf of the district attorney's office, we're pleased with the judge's decision to keep Annalise Keating in state custody for the duration of her prosecution.
A young man has been murdered, and it is of the utmost importance to A.D.A. Atwood and myself that Ms. Keating be brought to justice for this heinous crime.
You're right.
I acted like a neanderthal, and... Clearly, that's something I have to work on, and I will, but...
To have to spend another night in that dorm, alone...
Promise me I'll never see you act that way again.
I promise.
I'm serious.
That's not behavior
I can handle.
I know, and I...
Asher...
I'm not the only one you need to apologize to.
We intend to hold
Ms. Keating accountable
for her violent, senseless actions.
She took the life of this bright young man...
Hey.
One of her own law students
at Middleton university.
He was someone who trusted her,
who worked for her,
and, ultimately, was murdered by her.
Current charges against Ms. Keating
are arson and first-degree murder.
But we have just scratched the surface
of the evidence we plan to present.
In the past, Ms. Keating has been questioned for crimes close to her that have gone unsolved...
Most notably the murder of her husband, Sam Keating.
This trial will yield new information about that murder.
We're also here today to announce that we've received the official autopsy report for Mr. Gibbins.
Dr. Bradfield of the Philadelphia medical examiner's office has confirmed our initial suspicions that Mr. Gibbins' cause of death is asphyxiation due to smoke inhalation.
This reaffirms our belief that Ms. Keating planned and executed the fire in order to kill
Mr. Gibbins.
Mmm!
Smells like fresh fish.
I saw someone there...
In the basement.
They ran out of the storm door.
Was it you?
No.
It should have been you.
He'd still be alive if you would have just stayed away.
But he's dead.
I don't blame Annalise for that.
I blame you,
'cause it's always you.
I loved him so much more than I have ever loved you.
It should have been you.
Well, look who's back.
You're not permitted to be here.
You said he died before the fire.
Before I did the official autopsy.
Our initial theories change all the time.
Here.
I ain't trying to kill you.
What, y'all girlfriends now?
It's Frank.
Leave a message.
They're saying
Wes died in the fire, and it's not true, so...
Just... I need you.
We were told you wanted to make a statement?
About the murder of Wes Gibbins.
What about it?
I did it.
Hey.
Get in.
Come on.
It's time we talk.
Congratulations.
You've each been chosen for my very first criminal-law clinic.
In here, you're not just students but actual practicing lawyers.
You finally get to be me.
Thursdays on ABC...
At least they chose a good photo.
Brace yourself for a mystery so killer...
This could destroy us all.
Not everyone is gonna make it out alive.
No!
"How to Get Away with Murder."
Thursdays, 10:00, 9:00 central
on ABC.
What are you looking for?
It's right here.
Well, damn.
13 seasons
of fun.
Gimme, gimme, gimme.
13 seasons of drama.
This act was a felony.
It was nice knowing you.
Shut up.
13 seasons of twisty turns...
It's bad.
You're falling for me.
I slept with him.
Like only "Grey's" can deliver.
Damn right.
"Grey's Anatomy."
Thursdays on ABC.

## S03E11

His remains were found a few weeks later.
Did you all do that?
Do you really want to know?
I'm denying Ms. keating's request for bail and ordering that she be remanded to Philadelphia county prison.
Dr. bradfield of the Philadelphia medical examiner's office has confirmed that Mr. gibbins' cause of death is asphyxiation due to smoke inhalation.
You said he died before the fire.
Before I did the official autopsy.
Our initial theories change all the time.
I saw someone there. Was it you?
No.
It should have been you.
We were told you wanted to make a statement?
About the murder of Wes gibbins.
What about it?
I did it.
How'd you know where to find me?
I've got contacts at the station.
You know that.
What'd they want?
They're investigating Annalise.
You tell them anything?
No.
But I might.
About...?
That you killed my father.
You think Laurel would approve?
Why wouldn't she?
You'd be hurting me.
Maybe that's what she wants.
You don't know her.
Not like me.
I know that she deserves better than you.
And you think that's you?
I'd never hurt her the way you have.
Or Annalise.
You don't know Annalise.
You killed her son.
She told me.
And now you're dead to her.
You know that. Otherwise, you'd have hurt me by now.
But you're not gonna.
Because you know she would never forgive you for it.
That's how much more
I mean to her than you.
I picked him up in my car, told him
Annalise wanted to see him.
He was nervous... I could tell.
But then he got in.
I took him to the house.
When he saw she wasn't there, he got scared, tried to leave, so I knocked him out.
Chloroform.
Keating. On your feet.
I said, "on your feet"!
Where are you taking her?
Turn around.
Where you taking fresh fish?
I ain't even got a taste yet.
Dang, mama,
I was gonna make you my boo.
Cut the gas line and left the burner going on the stove.
Gave me time to get out before it all went up.
Watch your head.
Where are we going?
Why?
What?
Let's say we do believe you.
Why kill him?
Laurel.
She left me for him.
I tried to be okay with it, but...
I lost it when I found out she was pregnant.
On the gate!
Where's my lawyer?
You're violating my sixth amendment right to counsel.
She's all yours.
I demand to see my lawyer.
You wanted Laurel dead, too?
No.
She was in the house when it exploded...
She wasn't supposed to be.
That's why I'm here.
I can't take that I hurt her.
I don't talk till I see Bonnie.
She didn't answer her phone.
It's the middle of the night.
And this is urgent.
Let's talk about frank Delfino.
You were Delfino's lawyer, right? to murder his father...
Got him out on parole.
After that, you gave him a job, brought him into your home.
A little unorthodox.
Was he working as an investigator for you?
I killed him.
Frank...
Jfk...
And Elvis.
What else do you want to know?
All of it is inadmissible until you get me my lawyer.
Ms. winterbottom,
this is officer Taylor from the Philadelphia pd.
Get up. You're free to go.
No.
Your confession can't be corroborated.
So either we arrest you for obstruction of justice and perjury or you get to go home...
We forget this ever happened.
You got street cameras outside the station, right?
Ma'am, you can't just walk back there!
I'm Ms. keating's lawyer.
Ma'am!
You're gonna arrest me but not charge me?
We can question you for 48 hours before we have to charge you.
You got a lawyer you want us to call?
Nah. I'm done hiding.
Frank!
No. Get him out of here.
I killed Wes.
Tell Annalise I'm sorry!
Please! Tell her I'm sorry!
Obviously, this is a difficult time.
I urge you to use the resources we have available...
Talking to counselors, taking time off, whatever you need.
The office of the president will support you.
Thanks. That means a lot.
Obviously, we have some outside attention because of professor keating's arrest...
Police, journalists.
So please know we are a resource if you need any guidance.
He's a lawyer, right?
Um, Mike Richardson, a trustee for the university.
With all due respect, the whole
"we're here for you" spiel loses its intended effect when you have legal counsel taking notes.
It's university policy to have adequate record in situations like these.
You mean situations where you need to protect the endowment.
I can assure you my presence is simply about safeguarding your welfare.
No, you're afraid we're going to sue...
You know, for negligence and punitive damages for not providing adequate security to your students.
We simply wanted to check how you're doing.
Wes was a close friend of yours.
Not that close, really.
Regardless, we've all lost a member of this campus's family.
Did you ever even meet Wes?
No, but...
Have you scheduled a memorial for him yet?
Of course not. is to distance this university from professor keating.
Let me remind you that the most basic legal tenet is innocence until proven guilty. who... let's be clear...
Is being framed
Yet this office still hasn't released a statement of support for her, which I understand from a covering-your-ass point of view, but not from a looking-to-the-future one.
Professor keating is middleton law.
She is a brilliant, empowering force of legal nature, and you should think long and hard before you hang her out to dry.
They're talking to atwood.
She'll have to drop the charges now that frank's been arrested.
I've scheduled a call with judge Malik to get the paperwork moving.
I'm getting you out of here,
Annalise, by the end of the day.
Tomorrow at the latest.
Trust me.
I trusted you to get me out on bail.
Look how that went.
Where did the car go after?
Not sure, but we're checking all the security cameras.
And you still haven't found
Wes gibbins' phone?
No, so we're screwed.
We're on record that keating acted alone.
I know, but that doesn't prove
Delfino was involved.
He's the last person to see our victim alive.
You think any jury's gonna believe he didn't kill him?
Come in.
You wanted to see me?
Close the door.
What's this?
We need you back on the keating case.
What changed?
Frank Delfino confessed to killing Wes gibbins last night.
Doing it for Annalise.
Of course.
What do you need?
To make sure his story checks out.
You know Laurel castillo, right?
I haven't been back in a hospital since my wife was sick.
Ovarian cancer.
The hardest thing...
Losing someone too soon.
You still work for the d.A.?
Who do you think sent me?
When did you know you were pregnant?
Frank turned himself in last night.
He says he killed Wes because he found out about the baby.
So... You tell frank you were pregnant?
I don't feel well.
So you didn't tell him.
I want you to leave.
I know what it's like to be scared of Annalise, believe me.
Call me when you want to talk.
Hi.
Did frank confess?
Who told you that?
Just tell me.
Yes.
Who told you?
Nate. He just wants to know if frank knew I was pregnant.
Did he?
No.
I didn't even know.
Which means he's lying.
He's just trying to save Annalise, right?
I don't know.
I'll call you back.
Wait.
You have another suspect who has confessed.
A suspect who has every reason to do this at your client's bidding.
If you don't believe him, why hold him?
That's the detectives' call.
This office hasn't even decided if we even want to charge him.
Because you know you have to release my client the minute you do.
We need more than this very convenient confession to believe a career criminal.
So you're saying you have no other evidence yet?
We have evidence...
A mountain of it...
And it all points to Annalise keating.
Atwood's lying.
They have evidence against frank, and if I can find it,
I can get Annalise released.
You're tired. So am I.
But this helps us all.
What do you need?
Call Oliver.
Have him hack the d.A.
No.
He did it for Annalise once already.
That was before.
Before what?
He knows about Sam.
How?
I told him.
You what?!
Why would you do that?
'Cause I'm an ass.
Look, he already promised he wouldn't go to the police.
Well, we haven't been arrested yet, have we?
You thought things couldn't get any worse, right?
I'm gonna go talk to him. No.
You messed up.
Now it's my job to fix it.
How is that your job?
Who else is gonna be the grown-up around here?
Hey, bonbon's here. with the president this morning?
Because all I saw was an entitled crazy person.
I was saving our asses.
You were defending Annalise like she deserves it.
If they sell her out, which you know they want to do,
then we all go down.
Maybe we should. No!
When are we gonna stop helping Annalise,
You are the only one getting us in trouble right now.
Wes is dead.
Annalise probably killed him.
She didn't.
Sorry. Frank did.
He's just taking the fall.
You would believe that. Listen!
Annalise is a mess.
She is losing it in there, and...
I'm scared...
More than I should admit to you.
So I need your help, and so does she, and maybe you hate that...
And her.
But it is your lives on the line here, too.
It's as simple as that.
Well, looky who's back...
The boy-killer.
What, you didn't think
I knew how to read?
One of them
Mrs. Robinson type of things?
Your boy toy got tired of your sad old ta-tas, so you torched his ass?
Leave it alone, girl.
Well, ain't it bad enough our men getting shot up by the police.
Now they got to worry about us killing them, too?
Like police don't frame innocent people?
She ain't innocent!
Says right there she offed her husband, too!
Shoot, I'm scared, to be honest, like maybe you're one of them black widows and you're gonna come at me and jas next.
Hey!
You asleep?
I have 10 minutes before my rounds, so I thought
I would sneak you a-these.
Thanks.
So, I heard you could get discharged soon.
Yeah.
Any news from the police?
Nope.
Didn't I see that detective in here this morning?
I thought you were on an o.B. Rotation.
I am.
So how come you were here this morning?
I came to visit you.
You never stopped by.
Well, that's because that guy was in here.
Laurel?
What's going on?
We're not friends, meggy.
Maybe we could have been when Wes was still here, but he's dead.
And it's illegal for you to know details about my medical care when you're not actually my doctor, so...
I really need to sleep.
Sit down.
Why?
Just sit. Then we'll explain.
My god. You're making this worse than it has to be.
You've said enough on this topic, so you can shut your mouth.
We know you know, Oliver.
You told them.
Don't look at him. Right here.
This is clearly a stressful time for you, as it is for all of us, and I'm sorry about that.
Thanks.
We understand that you don't know any of the details.
Yeah, and I don't want to.
I think that's smart,
He just said that he doesn't want to know.
Sam deserved it.
Even Annalise would tell you that if she could.
Back here.
Every action you take right now has consequences for us.
Michaela. This is my life on the line, and I've worked too hard to have it ruined because someone opened their fat mouth!
You understand... Right?
I do.
Great.
Now you need to hack the d.A.
We checked every street cam in a 10-mile radius.
We can't locate Delfino's car in any of them.
So it's possible they separated before Wes died.
Delfino says he drove Wes straight to keating's house.
I don't believe that.
We have enough to charge him.
Give me more time.
Why?
I just need to think. Please.
Come in.
Should I come back?
No, we're done.
Keep it open.
You're the one who cried sexual harassment.
Tell me you got something out of the girl.
She won't talk to me.
Can I do anything else?
Help me get a new job after I get fired.
Stop. The second the press hears we wrongfully indicted
Annalise keating, I'm done.
Ship me back to Tulsa.
Let me talk to frank.
No.
I know the guy.
And I'm damn good at my job.
You're sure you don't want a lawyer?
I waive my rights.
Let's just get this over with so you can charge me.
See, I'm not sure that's gonna happen.
I confessed.
You got me on candid camera.
What's so hard?
You're lying for Annalise.
And I understand why.
She's controlled you for quite a long time.
Y'all have got 15 minutes!
Yeah, yeah. I heard you. Shoot.
Come on. Over here.
Put your stuff there.
Push to the front, get in, get out.
You were just a sad, angry criminal.
And Annalise showed up, worked her magic, and got you 10 years free.
And now you're sitting here, paying her what she's owed.
She don't look as good as she did in the paper.
She's still trying to keep that weave tight, though.
Why she ain't turning around?
'Cause she rude.
Hey, yo!
Why you kill that boy?
Hey, I'm talking to you!
Annalise had nothing to do with this.
Of course she did.
She loved that kid.
No, she told you to be a good little soldier and take the fall for her.
You deaf, bitch?
I asked you a question.
Why'd you kill that boy?
I didn't.
Like hell you didn't.
Dumbass burnt down her own big-ass crib, too.
Guess lawyers ain't as smart as we thought.
Look at her running scared.
You're lying for her.
That camera shows Wes got in your car at 4:24 P.M., but the house didn't explode until a few hours later.
What happened in between?
I'm done.
Seriously.
Release me, call a public defender to get you off my back, but I'm done being interrogated.
You hear me? Done.
Yo, what this weave set you back?
Got to be at least half a g or so.
Enough to keep me in smokes till my trial.
Get the hell away from me before I beat your face!
You gonna beat my ass?
Let's see.
Hey! Hey!
You want to roll up on somebody, let's do it.
Or you just want to talk?
That's right! You better run!
Better sleep with one eye open, too.
You trying to get killed?
Here.
The only thing they like smelling more than a man in here is fear.
Take it!
Keating!
Visitor.
I'm not who you were expecting.
No.
I'm sorry if this is a shock.
It's just... I had a meeting with your students this morning.
What?
It's just protocol. Honestly.
Still, talking with them, hearing how important you are to them...
What is this?
'Cause if you're here to fire me, I got that part.
No.
Then why are you here?
As my a.A. Friend?
'Cause let me be clear...
If anyone offers me any liquor in here, I'm drinking it.
Go. Say what you came to say.
Say it!
I just came to make sure you were okay.
That's all.
I'm sorry, Annalise.
I'm fine.
I know.
Still, I'm sorry.
You threatened him.
Please! That was a gentle nudge.
You want to see a threat?
Try me.
My god, you've lost it.
I am the only one holding us together right now.
Because you're acting like Mussolini right now.
Mussolini got things done, didn't he?
It may come as a surprise to you, but I was not always the glue that held this group together.
Yeah. I was late to the party, too.
Not... That it's a party.
It's a... Murder.
That's bad, but...
I just... I get how scary this can be, finding out about all the... Awfulness.
So... I'm here if you ever need to... Talk or... You just... Want a hug.
Michaela! Connor!
What's wrong?
I got into atwood's server looking for stuff that they had on frank, but it's mostly stuff they had on Annalise.
They found a Jane Doe in the woods, and the lab ran a bunch of DNA tests to try to identify her.
Who is it?
Rebecca.
It's the po-po.
We must have triggered an alarm.
They knew we were hacking...
No. No, no, no. I put up a bunch of firewalls.
Shut up and act normal.
Did you find anything yet?
Look at that.
Either the d.A.'S office is out of options or they decided to send in the big guns.
Nice to see you, too.
New gig going well?
It'd be a whole lot better if you told me the truth.
That's all I've done.
Yet here I sit.
No charge in sight.
Wes didn't die in the fire, man.
The m.E. Report says he did.
So did you, in your... Confession.
You screwed up with Annalise.
She told me that while you were away.
So this is your way of fixing things.
Not everything's about Annalise.
Did frank kill Rebecca?
Bonbon, please don't lie to us.
Why would I lie to you right now?
Are you being serious?
I don't know anything that you don't know.
Please, just...
Everyone breathe.
Bonnie.
God. What now?
They have a lot more on Annalise than just Rebecca...
Like, tons.
They're investigating her for Sam, the hapstalls,
Emily sinclair, Lila stangard.
I can't do this anymore.
That's what
I've been trying to say.
Bonbon?
You were right.
They're not going to stop.
Even if they charge frank for Wes, they're just going to keep coming at you.
For Sam..
Rebecca...
Everything.
You need to put it all on frank.
We'll go to atwood, ask for a deal, say you'll talk.
Frank's a sociopath, you were scared for your life, so you didn't say anything, but that's the reason he left town, so you only knew for a few months.
He owes you this. He knows that.
You act like you're bringing me a solution.
It is.
It's a lie.
It's the only shot you have right now.
Please.
Is Annalise gonna do it?
They're meeting with atwood right now.
Russia.
They don't extradite to the U.S.
They don't like gay people there.
Or black people.
I'm assuming.
Well, there have to be other countries that...
Don't Google countries where we can seek asylum.
The police might be tracking our phones.
All the more reason for us to do something.
I'm serious.
We can... we can break Laurel out of here, pick up oli, and uber straight to the airport.
My passport's expired.
I didn't think I'd be able to travel anywhere for a while.
Well, there goes that plan.
Meggy's acting sketchy.
She keeps visiting me.
She brought me jello.
Isn't that just nice?
Nice... Or sketchy.
God.
How could we all be so stupid?
We have information relating to various investigations.
In exchange, we'd like an immunity deal for all charges against Ms. keating.
You mean a "get out of jail free" card for crimes orchestrated by your client.
Ms. keating played no part in these crimes.
Therefore, there will be no admission of guilt.
Of course not.
We came here to negotiate in good faith.
You mean to leverage bodies for leniency.
I'm sure the state is as interested as we are in bringing closure to the families of these unsolved cases.
To be clear, these are unsolved murder cases.
We've told you everything we're willing to tell you without a deal.
One of your own students.
An orphan who fought his way through a difficult foster-care system to become something.
Ms. keating is clearly devastated
You were his professor, and he trusted you.
It is in your interest to negotiate with us. He didn't have a mother figure, so you just stepped right in and took advantage of that.
Speaking to my client in this way is an abuse of power.
But that's what you do.
You get vulnerable, broken people into your clutches, and you devour them.
That's enough.
You insinuated yourself into this boy's life.
You abused your power as his teacher.
You ruined his life.
You did this.
Burned this poor boy alive.
Just think about the pain that he felt as he died.
The agony...
You want to know pain?!
I'll show you pain!
Uncuff me!
Look at my pain!
Uncuff me, I'll show you pain!
I'll show you pain.
Uncuff me. Uncuff me!
Look at my pain!
No deal.
Why is that funny?
but your cupcakes are dry and tasteless.
Nobody ever likes your cupcakes.
My cupcakes are moist and delicious.
Men love my cupcakes. Hey.
How'd it go?
She get the deal?
I need to talk to Laurel alone.
Why?
Just let me talk to her.
I'll be fine.
What is it?
You can fix this.
Give me all your 9s.
Go fish.
What the hell happened to you?
Give me the blade.
You're not gonna kill yourself, are you?
Just give it to me!
Hello.
Would the lady like to take off her clothes?
I am Gustav, and I heard that the queen bee is in need of a rubdown.
Funny.
I'm under explicit instructions to make sure you feel...
So very good.
Asher, stop.
Sorry.
Just... You were a boss today, and, yeah, it's hot, but also it was nice, too.
You know, feeling like someone's in charge, especially... Right now.
So "thank you" is all that I w...
Gustav was trying to say.
Focus on my shoulder blades.
That's where
I carry all my stress.
As my lady commands.
Hey.
Hey.
Is Michaela behind you to threaten me again?
Can I say anything, do anything?
Yeah, you can tell me this is all just a terrible joke.
Like the time my brother told me
Mr. giggles got hit by a car, and I cried for hours, until he brought the cat into my bedroom and I learned all about April fools' day.
How have you been doing this?
Get up in the morning and go to class, listen to me complain about my role.
You don't have a role.
Even that... pretending like things can be normal again.
I don't know how you've been doing this by yourself this whole time.
Now do you know why I wanted you to go to the police?
You were right to break up with me.
Stop.
You wouldn't be in this mess if it weren't for my big mouth.
I made you tell me.
I should have broken up with you, oli.
A long time ago.
I should have rejected you or made you hate me, but instead,
I... Just needed you.
I need you, too.
Will you spoon me?
Don't let go.
I won't.
We dated off and on since first year.
When you say "off and on"...
It wasn't the most stable relationship.
So you broke up last spring, and then you started dating Wes.
Then frank killed him because of your little love triangle?
It's more complicated than that.
I saw frank last week.
I told him I was pregnant.
And that it was Wes'.
I would have never told him if I ever thought he would hurt Wes.
Did Annalise put you up to this?
I haven't talked to Annalise since the fire.
And Bonnie... she never visited you in the hospital?
The visitors records will verify that.
I remember something else from that night.
The doctors said that it would happen, that the drugs would... Wear off and that I would remember things.
I, saw frank...
Before the explosion.
Where?
In the basement.
He ran out of the storm door.
He did this.
Annalise uses you.
You do whatever she wants because you know she'll get rid of you otherwise.
What else have you done for her?
Killed people?
Rebecca?
Rebecca ran away.
I know she was murdered.
Congratulations.
You're finally getting charged.
Frank Delfino, you are being charged with the first-degree murder of Wesley gibbins.
Your bail hearing will be set under the rules of criminal procedure.
Until then, you will be residing in the county prison.
Clearly, you're still hung up on this girl, so... Why don't we find her?
Can't be too hard to locate a white girl with cornrows.
You killed her.
Stop. Admit it.
I killed your dad.
Not Rebecca.
You know frank didn't do this.
An eyewitness placed him at the scene.
We had no choice but to charge him. but he died before that, according to the m.E.
That was her initial report.
Then run a second autopsy!
That's not necessary.
Because it's a cover-up?
From where I stand,
the suspicious person in all of this is you.
Is that it?
You're actually the one covering up for Annalise?
My job here is to ask questions.
You're asking the wrong ones.
Am I?
Go home and get some sleep.
Clearly, you need it.
Take me back to the police station.
Why?
You gonna tattle on us?
Maybe.
Fine.
I'll walk.
They charged frank.
And?
They charged him as your co-conspirator.
I thought that
I could do this, Annalise.
I really did.
I thought...
That this would get you out.
It's okay.
It's not.
Bonnie.
I deserve this.
We got a puppy problem.
What?
He knows Rebecca's dead.
How?
Cops, I guess.
Are you still following him?
Yeah.
You want me to do anything else?
Just don't lose him.
I'll call you soon.
Congratulations.
You've each been chosen for my very first criminal-law clinic.
In here, you're not just students but actual practicing lawyers.
You finally get to be me.
Thursdays on abc...
At least they chose a good photo.

It was nice knowing you.
Shut up.

You're falling for me.
I slept with him.

## S03E12

 Previously on "how to get away
 with murder"...
Frank turned himself in last night.
Atwood: You ruined his life.
You did this.
Just think about the pain that he felt.
You want to know pain?!
I'll show you pain!
No deal.
You can fix this.
I remember something else.
I saw frank...
In the basement.
He ran out of the storm door.
Davis: Frank Delfino, you are being charged with the first-degree murder of Wesley gibbins.
Bonnie:
They charged frank.
And?
They charged him as your co-conspirator.
Wes: They're investigating
Annalise.
You tell them anything?
No.
But I might.
Frank:
We got a puppy problem.
He knows Rebecca's dead.
Just don't lose him.
Â¶Â¶
[ tires screech ]
Oh!
It's not a crosswalk, genius!
Why are they questioning Wes?
Is it because of Annalise's investigation?
I said I'm not doing this here.
If she goes down, she's gonna take you with her.
You know that.
What'd you say?
You know how she gets when she's desperate.
Don't you ever threaten me again.
[ Cellphone rings ]
Hey.
Frank: I lost him.
He turned down an alley.
He's gone.
Go to Annalise's.
He probably thinks she's there.
I'll go to his apartment.
Got it.
Frank.
Yeah.
Do not hurt him.
I won't.
You, uh...
You okay, bud?
Yeah.
Just...
Can you hurry?
I'll do my best.
[ Cellphone vibrates ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Ringing ]
It's christophe.
Michaela:
Yay to discharge day!
Okay, that sounds grosser out loud than it did in my head.
Uh, yay to getting out of here finally, is what I mean.
I brought some options.
Although I think i need to see them on to know which one looks best.
Claudia: Oh, there she go,
Casey freakin' Anthony, off to another one of her special hearings.
Jasmine: [ Chuckles ]
Casey Anthony was acquitted, and you the only one in here being charged with hurting they own kids.
 Neglecting my kids.
That's way different than this one here murdering a boy.
[ Scoffs ]
Next time you murder somebody, maybe you'll get a special hearing, too.
Henderson: Professor!
Let's go.
Â¶ I can see for miles Â¶
Connor: Here.
Thanks.
How do you do this?
Hm?
Go out into the world knowing one wrong word and everyone goes to jail.
[ Sighs ]
You don't have to go if you don't want to.
She needs us.
My client is an innocent woman who is being unfairly targeted due to her association with a sociopathic employee.
Due to her association with Mr. Delfino, a career criminal with a well-documented history of violence, including a previous attempted-murder case against his own father.
Whereas my client has no criminal record to speak of whatsoever.
I thereby request you sever their cases and schedule separate trials.
Hey.
How you feeling?
Nerv-- nervous?
Well, I wasn't till you just said that.
I'm sorry.
I just, um...
-You look great.
-No.
She'll look great once she finally puts these on.
Â¶ Angel just above the grid Â¶ it's an arraignment.
No need to be nervous.
I'm not ner--
I'm not nervous.
I'm just, um...
Getting ready for the game.
I got this.
Please tell me they're not coming.
Who?
The kids.
I thought I told you.
The memorial's today.
Who the hell are all these people?
Tragedy whores.
Â¶ That's all right Â¶
Â¶ I decline Â¶
Jacobs:
It's my understanding that there are now two defendants in this trial?
That is correct, your honor.
The commonwealth is amending the charges to list Mr. Delfino and Ms. keating as co-conspirators.
Counsel may proceed with the reading of charges.
The defendants are charged with one count of first-degree murder.
A special circumstance...
Did you know they were gonna come?
No.
...alleging this conspiracy was pre-meditated.
So, Wes, uh, where do I start?
Um...
Wes was a really great guy.
Like, really just...
Good.
And that says a lot because he didn't really have an easy life.
No.
It was actually really...Dark.
Like, his mom died when he was 12 -- suicide.
And then his father -- oh, god.
Well, we don't really have time to get into that.
It's upsetting, to say the least.
Maybe you should have written something for her.
My point is, it's awful, isn't it, that this is what happened to him.
Like...
[ Sobbing ]
Why are you crying?
Did you even know Wes?
Did any of you?
I take it that's a no?
Law school isn't really about making friends, right?
Yeah, I bet some of you are really happy that he's dead
'cause that means your ranking goes up one.
Great.
Okay, I'm going.
Like, there's not even a body to bury.
You're all vultures glomming onto this tragedy like it's your own.
Well, it's not your tragedy!
Please stop.
It is Wes', and he deserves better than this funeral with you phony-ass people!
So just go cry somewhere else!
[ Sobbing ]
Bonnie: Linking my client's case to Mr. Delfino creates bias in the eyes of the jury.
I thereby move to sever their cases to avoid any prejudice against my client.
Judge, this is an arraignment.
The commonwealth is not prepared to argue a motion to sever.
Neither are we, your honor.
Ms. winterbottom, you can argue a motion to sever at a separate hearing.
Are we finished?
Your honor, I'd also like to revisit bail.
Bail, your honor, has already been denied.
Only one defendant in this courtroom has confessed in this crime, and that is Mr. Delfino.
Objection.
My client's alleged confession is not an issue here.
Mr. Delfino has stated he acted alone.
Clearly pointing to undue influence by Ms. keating.
Mr. Delfino never mentioned any involvement by my client.
Judge, we're not here to argue the facts of this case.
I am advocating for my client who has been unfairly lumped in with an amoral reprobate.
Objection!
Ms. keating has no violent record, unlike Mr. Delfino!
I request your censure
Ms. winterbottom for recklessly impugning my client!
Jacobs: Enough.
Ms. winterbottom, outbursts of this nature can only hurt your client.
Ms. keating's bail continues to be denied.
[ Gavel bangs ]
Don't go at her that hard anymore.
That's my job.
No, your job is to do what I say.
Woman:
Hands behind your back.
Anna Mae!
You shouldn't be here, mama.
We drove all night the minute we heard you were having another hearing.
Let's go.
Bonnie: It's her parents.
Can you give them a minute?
They can visit in prison.
Go home, mama.
No! We'll come see you right away, Anna Mae!
I mean it!
Go home, mama!
Anna Mae!
There he is.
Don't you go tipping out on us,
Nathaniel.
I'm sorry about all this.
Don't be sorry.
Just tell us how you gonna fix it!
I work for the d.A.'S office now.
You mean for the people trying to convict her?
You know she didn't do this.
I know.
But any involvement by me would just look suspicious.
Not helping her is what's gonna look suspicious.
You saw her, Nathaniel.
She needs you.
Don't let me have to get down on these old knees and beg you to be halfway decent.
I can't help, ma'am.
And I thought you was a good man.
Come on.
Woman: Hello!
[ Inmates cheering ]
Woman: Look who's back!
We knew it!
How did it go?
Well, that's okay.
You still got lots of rounds of fight left in you.
Is it 'cause she a lawyer?
Is that why you keep suckin' up?
'Cause I've been your roomie for months now, and you don't give no kinds of damn about my case.
Wrong.
I don't give a damn about you.
Yeah, whatever.
You cracked if you think queen Elizabeth here ever gonna help you with your case?
And why wouldn't I?
Maybe I'd help you, too, if you shut your mouth for once.
Please.
In what world can your child-murdering ass help me with my case?
He wasn't my child!
Keep coming at me.
Come on.
Maybe I will murder someone.
Annalise the hood-rat, that's my new name for you.
[ Chuckles ]
Why can't we talk to her?
Because she's asking too many questions.
Well, yeah, she dated Wes.
Of course she's gonna be asking questions.
Or she's a spy trying to bring us all down.
Hey, guys.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Laurel was right.
None of us knew Wes like you all did, and I can't imagine what you must all be feeling.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Um, I have to ask.
Ask what?
Keating.
Like, she did it, right?
You're serious?
Oh, my god. Don't tell me you're still defending her.
Innocent until proven guilty, or are you as dumb as you look?
Wes was your friend.
The only thing he deserves right now is for you not to defend the woman who killed him.
Hey, this is a memorial.
We all came here to grieve, and you think it's appropriate to be pouring salt in the wounds?
Dude, I'm just speaking the truth.
No, you're a horrible person and you need to leave.
I'm sorry.
Michaela:
She wasn't in the bathroom and she's not answering her phone.
Maybe she got an uber home.
Maybe she found a bridge to jump off.
Everyone call her.
Hi.
Can I see my boyfriend's body?
His name is Wes gibbins.
Are you okay, hon?
Yeah.
Can I see him?
G-i-b-b-i-n-s.
The d.A.'S office is holding Mr. gibbins' remains as evidence until the end of his trial.
But I'm his girlfriend.
I understand.
It's just -- i don't think you do.
I've been in the hospital until today, and I almost died in the same fire that he did, which is why I never got the, you know, the chance to say goodbye.
Honey, there are strict rules here.
I'm pregnant with his child.
Talk to the d.A.'S office.
My hands are tied.
You're going to hell someday.
 Laurel: It's Laurel.
 Leave a message,
but I'll probably never listen.
[ Beep ]
Call me back so I know you're okay.
We'll find her.
I promise.
Connor: Just hope she's not dead when we do.
I don't know if I can take another one of these memorials.
[ Cellphone rings ]
Is that her?
It's a blocked call.
Because it's her.
Answer it!
This is Oliver.
Mr. Hampton?
Yeah?
This is detective Davis with the Philadelphia police.
Do you have any time to stop by later today?
Um...
She said they want to interview me.
-About Annalise?
-I don't know.
He can't talk to them, right?
I told her
I'd be there at 2:00.
You shouldn't have said that.
Look, I didn't think i had a choice!
Connor:
This is a disaster.
He needs a lawyer, right?
What kind of lawyer can we get in two hours?
Okay, we can hide him, like Annalise did with Wes.
Look how that worked out for him.
Michaela: They must know that he hacked the d.A.'S office.
No, oli put up firewalls!
Well, they didn't work, did they?
What if Laurel went to the police?
No, you're being paranoid.
You didn't see her at the memorial this morning.
-She lost it.
-People...
To the point that I wouldn't be surprised if she went to confess everything.
People!
I think I'm having a panic attack.
Baby.
My baby.
I fixed you a plate, but the guards made me leave it in the car.
It's okay.
It's not okay.
Look at you.
You're just nothing but skin and bones.
You got to eat, Anna Mae.
I'm eating, mama.
I told Celestine not to let you come.
She didn't know.
Your mama and me took off in the middle of the night like a couple of car thieves.
[ Chuckles ]
Point being, we're here now.
For as long as it takes to get you out.
No.
I've never seen you quite so low, baby.
And who but your family can lift you up out of this mess, hmm?
I gave that Nathaniel a good talking to.
What?
What kind of man wouldn't help his woman?
It's okay.
We're here to help you now.
Whatever needs to be done, whether it's bringing you food or coming to be with you every day.
'Cause you think that's what I want?
You seeing me in here like this?
I'm gonna fix this.
No, you can't, mama.
I can. I can.
All I have to do is to tell the police the truth.
You didn't burn down the house.
I did.
Ophelia...
I'll tell them that I made sure all the kids was out of the house.
And then I poured hooch all over the couch that Clyde was on.
Mama, stop.
They got to know what that pervert did to you.
And that you're here to take the fall for your mama.
I'm not gonna let you do that, baby.
They want to lock me up, that's fine.
The only judgment I fear is from the lord god almighty.
And if I go to hell for burning that bastard, then so be it.
Why didn't you tell me?
The doctor said it's just a bit of dementia.
You should have told me.
She has episodes every now and again, but she usually comes out of them pretty quick.
She just confessed to burning down the house with your brother inside.
She makes up stories.
It wasn't a story.
What?
Man: That's it, you two.
Come back tomorrow.
We'll all still be here.
Bonnie: Mr. Hampton, what exactly is it you do for the middleton legal clinic?
I was hired as a technology expert, keeping case files locked.
Did that include any of
Annalise's personal case files?
No.
Just the clinic.
Good job.
[ Southern accent ] I have a question for you, son.
Was it normal for this professor of yours to require you to do illegal hacking?
Oliver:
I wouldn't say it was normal.
So it was odd that she called you at 8:52 P.M.
The night of the fire?
She was only asking me to look into a pro bono case.
Bonnie:
It's better if you keep your answers as vague as possible.
That way, you technically won't have to lie.
She wanted me to do some research.
And did keating ask you to do anything else for her that night?
Like what?
Michaela:
Just answer the question.
Did she ask you to clear any files on her phone or not?
No, she didn't ask me to do anything illegal like that.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Yes!
Then why are you sweating?
Wes was my friend.
And he was murdered.
Okay?
So, forgive me if my mind is a little foggy on some of the details.
I'm in no rush.
Take your time.
Thanks.
I do want to know why you went back to the legal clinic after talking to professor keating at the scene of the fire.
Connor:
He can't do this.
Yes, I can!
You need to call, buy yourself more time.
No!
You need to get him out of this.
Connor, I can do this.
You don't need to protect us, oli--
I'm protecting myself!
I am the one who decided to get involved, okay?
No one forced my hand or threatened me.
I did this willingly.
And now I have to face the consequences.
Keep going.
I can take it.
Davis: We have records showing that you swiped into the clinic at 10:53 P.M. that night.
Was it because professor keating asked you to go do something for her?
Clear her phone of suspicious material, for example?
Of course not!
That would be illegal.
I told her I only went to the legal clinic because I was an emotional wreck and I didn't where else to go.
Yes, girl.
You did good.
Thanks.
Did we find Laurel?
[ Knock on door ]
[ Sighs ]
Please open the door if you're in there.
Laurel!
I'm gonna kill you if you're alive in there!
[ Sighs ]
You're out of the hospital.
How are you feeling?
[ Sighs ]
Better.
You told me i could come and see you and talk to you when I was ready.
No, I told you to talk to me when you finally wanted to come clean.
So unless you're here to say you didn't actually see frank in the basement that night --
I did!
Got to go.
Can you help me see Wes?
The d.A. Has his remains booked as evidence.
Then you're out of luck.
Imagine if you couldn't have said goodbye to your wife!
You can get me in, right?
The burns are pretty bad.
It's okay.
You honestly want me to believe you just lost the body?
-We're gonna find it.
-You better.
-Nate --
-otherwise, you're gonna have a lot of people thinking there's a conspiracy going on.
Stop.
I won't be surprised if the judge throws out the whole case!
Exactly.
Because the victim's girlfriend now knows we lost his body!
You want to blame this on me?
Why don't you just tell us why you took her there.
Because you asked me to get close to her.
Please.
This is not my fault.
By taking
Ms. castillo there, you handed Annalise her defense on a platter.
Gross negligence, denial of due process.
Bonnie:
Tampering with evidence.
I ordered a second autopsy so they'll have to come clean.
It's awful to think about, i know.
But unless they find his body, this helps your case.
My mother has dementia.
It's fine.
Just call my doctor's office and ask them if they can recommend any long-term care facilities.
Okay.
Some place close.
Celestine's gonna fight me on this, but she hid it from me, too, so I don't care.
What?
I'm getting you out of here.
Stop saying that.
They lost his body.
It proves you're being framed.
It doesn't prove anything, and you know it.
Just help me with my mother.
At least that's something we can fix.
[ Sighs ]
Gentlemen, we dodged a big-ass bullet today thanks to the o-man's baller cop-lying skills.
Can you keep it down?
The walls are super thin.
Okay. Whatever.
A toast!
To oli, for being a great liar, and most importantly, to Wes.
We might not have given you the proper memorial, but...
We can still pour one out for you.
Sorry.
I'll get paper towels.
You mad at me?
A little.
[ Sighs ]
To Wes.
Do you think i like this?
Believe me, the last thing I want to do is act like your mother.
Really? 'Cause you're way better at it than my mother.
I'm good at everything I do!
I'm just saying, it's cruel to not answer your phone.
I'm sorry.
Don't apologize.
Just promise me you won't go a.W.O.L. Again.
[ Sighs ]
I'm sleeping on the couch.
No.
Asher farts in his sleep.
I could use a night off.
Do you think he did it?
Frank?
[ Sighs ]
I want to believe he did
'cause then that way
I'd have someone to hate.
But if he didn't, then whoever killed Wes is still out there.
I just wish we knew.
Okay, I'm too old to sleep on the couch.
Scoot.
Hey!
Look at my babies!
[ Laughs ]
Mmm!
Give me a hug!
Let's go sit.
Oh, my baby.
I'm the mother.
You're the child.
And the last thing you should be doing right now is worrying about me.
It's just that I think we need to have a plan in place.
I got that covered.
-You do?
-Yes.
I'm gonna be with your mother every day, stay by her side, make sure she doesn't go shoplifting any supermarkets...
Oh, shut your mouth!
[ Laughs ]
How do I know you won't get bored and run off someplace like you always do?
Excuse me.
Where are you going?
You two need to talk.
I'm going to utilize the facilities and give you two time to fix this thing, whatever it is.
Ophelia --
I said fix it!
I didn't know.
Which part?
'Cause I told you what he did to me.
Celestine's
13th birthday party.
You showed up drunk.
I brought you a piece of mama's peach cobbler out on the porch.
Or are you having memory problems, too?
I meant I didn't know about the fire, that your mother -- you said you didn't believe me.
Anna Mae, listen -- and how was I supposed to make you believe me, huh?
You want proof?
Pictures?
I don't remember -- you remember.
I just let you ignore it.
You were always so good at ignoring things.
I'm sorry, okay?
I should have said more, done more.
But he was dead.
I was hoping it was over.
It's still not over.
Look at me.
You think me ending up here had nothing to do with it?
You want to blame me for your sad childhood?
Maybe I deserve that, but you do not get to sit here and blame me for where you're sitting right now.
This mess is all you.
Well, if you think that, then maybe we should be done.
You go your way and I go mine.
This is your pain talking,
Anna Mae.
All I have is pain!
We all got pain.
You know, there's enough pain in this one room to make me curl up in a ball and give up.
Which proves my point.
You ain't special.
What you are is selfish.
'Cause if you really wanted to help your mama, you'd be trying to get your ass out of this jail!
Tell your mother
I'll be in the lobby.
Michaela: It's noon.
You have to get up.
I don't, actually.
Laurel.
President hargrove said we don't have to go to class yet.
You have a meeting with frank in an hour.
I called his public defender, said I was your lawyer from the middleton clinic and told him it was your legal right to confront the man accused of killing your boyfriend.
I also pointed out it could benefit his case to have the victim provide sympathetic input for sentencing.
So, go, get your answer.
My client has agreed to this recorded meeting and wishes to show his remorse prior to sentencing.
Now, this is not an interview, and if there is any exchange that I deem detrimental to my client's case, i will end things here.
Clear?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
For what?
Everything.
[ Scoffs ]
I don't know why I'm here.
I don't.
I guess I just wanted to look you in the eye finally
'cause I haven't wanted to believe that it's true that you did...
That you did that to Wes.
[ Sighs ]
But I saw you leave the basement, so...
I guess I just have to believe my own eyes.
I should, right?
Do not answer that.
What were his last words, frank?
Okay. Meeting's over.
Guard!
Tell me his last words.
[ Knocking ]
Enough.
Tell me so that I can finally move on.
I said that we are through here!
Tell me what his last words were, frank!
[ Door slams ]
He didn't do it.
He told you that.
He couldn't.
His lawyer was there.
Then how do you know?
Did he blink twice or something?
I just know.
And I know that he did it.
He didn't.
This wasn't frank.
Because it was you?
Okay, everyone needs to just chill.
Annalise is being framed.
[ Scoffs ]
That's right.
You know, I forgot.
Who's doing that today?
The mahoneys or the d.A.?
-Connor.
-What?
It is possible that frank did this.
Thinking that does not make me crazy.
Then stop acting crazy.
Nobody's crazy.
We're all crazy!
I mean, god, look at us.
We're sitting around debating who murdered our friend.
Your friend?
You treated him like crap.
You still are!
Uh, no, I'm not.
His body is missing, Connor!
Do you even care about that?
Do any of you?
-Laurel, we all feel bad.
-Yeah.
Then think about what that means!
And not just for you, but for Wes.
Somebody killed him, burned his body, and misplaced it!
And it wasn't frank.
Maybe none of you can understand how I know that, but he just wouldn't do that to me.
No matter what he's saying, so just -- we need to find out who did this.
[ Cellphone rings ]
This is Bonnie.
Due to an unfortunate clerical error, the body of Mr. gibbins has been misplaced.
The m.E. Is performing an escalated search to find him.
Your honor, i find it very convenient that this clerical error coincides with my request for a second autopsy.
I'm not sure what you're insinuating.
Your office is purposely hiding evidence that will exonerate my client.
Jacobs:
Hold up. Ms. winterbottom.
Are you accusing me of willful misconduct?
I don't see how my client can get a fair trial without the ability to fully examine the victim.
Well, let me remind you, there's already been an official autopsy.
On a body that's now missing.
This is a grossly negligent error.
That will be corrected the minute we locate the victim.
This is a civil rights issue, your honor.
Excuse me?
The d.A.'S office continues to railroad a prominent
African-American female attorney based on a personal vendetta.
All the evidence is circumstantial, another man has confessed, and now the victim's body is m.I.A.?
What other proof do I need to get my client released on bail?
The judge denied my request for bail.
Clearly she's part of this.
They all are.
Which is why I want to push for a judicial recusal.
Or file an ethical complaint for bias.
If we can get a new judge...
Annalise?
Your boys seem nice.
How old?
Luis is 8, Tyrone 12.
Mm.
Such a shame.
They already know how much of a disappointment you are.
Excuse me?
They probably celebrated when you were hauled off to jail, relieved that they didn't have to deal with your cracked-out mess anymore.
Shut your mouth.
They don't love you.
I saw it on their faces.
Say something else about my boys.
Your sons wince when you hug them. Why?
Okay, cool it.
-Did you touch them?
-Shut up.
That's it, isn't it?
You didn't just neglect them.
You molested them.
They were too afraid to say anything, sexually abused by their own mother.
Shut up!
Guard! Guard! Guard!
Oh, my god.
Annalise, what happened.
Take a picture.
Annalise.
I said take a picture.
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
The other inmates know who she is and are targeting her.
The commonwealth can move Ms. keating into solitary confinement.
If Ms. keating isn't released on bail,
I'm releasing these photos to the press and announcing a very public lawsuit against the d.A.'S office for civil rights violations.
It's months before the trial.
She'll be dead if we leave her in that jail.
Who the hell are you?
BeyoncÃ©.
Who the hell are you?
Bonnie: Release her on conditional bail.
Take away her passport.
She'll pose no flight risk.
[ Door buzzes ]
Â¶ In the end I saw you Â¶ it looks worse than it feels.
Oh, baby.
They hurt you.
They hurt you.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't you let them see you cry.
Don't you let them.
 Laurel: It's Laurel.
 Leave a message,
but I'll probably never listen.
[ Beep ]
Where are you?
That bitch better not be in
New York stalking the mahoneys.
You know what's good is that now that Annalise is out of jail, it's her job to take care of everyone, not yours.
Are you kidding?
It just means
I'm gonna have to worry more.
[ Sighs ]
Is it bad if I want her to stay in there?
Well, a little.
Would it help if I let you fornicate with me?
Shut up.
Actually, yes.
Â¶ And I knew it would be you Â¶
[ laughing ]
Um, are -- are you okay?
Yeah. No, I'm sorry.
[ Laughs ]
I was just remembering how Laurel went off on all those crying people at Wes' memorial.
And then I got called into the police station and I lied to their faces.
Aw, are you worried about me?
Nah.
Just learning a lot about you.
Like what?
Like you're a really good liar.
Eh, not really.
Sure, you are.
I mean, first, my Stanford acceptance, now the cops.
Plus your pants are almost always on fire, so...
I am a good liar.
I know.
I just said that.
There's another lie, is what I mean.
You know, the first thing you learn when you hack a system is to make sure you have an escape route that only you know about.
I erased Annalise's phone that night.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, but I saved a copy.
Â¶Â¶
[ keys jingling ]
Female voice: You are receiving
 a call from an inmate
at Philadelphia country prison.
 This call is being recorded.
To accept the charges, press 3.
[ Cellphone beeps ]
Hello?
Hey. It's me.
Mr. Delfino, it is an ethical violation for you to be calling me.
It's fine.
If you have anything to say, you need to say it through your lawyer.
You're speaking to him.
What?
I fired the guy.
I'm gonna represent myself.
We're co-counsel now.
We get to meet in private, all communications between us are privileged.
So, when do you want to have our first meeting?
Mac: Celestine's gonna expect a call tomorrow.
And thelonius.
They'll be so relieved to hear you're not locked up in that hellhole anymore.
Mama? What's wrong?
You should have let me tell them.
You're my baby girl.
You don't deserve to be in jail for something I did.
Ophelia, we're not talking about that right now.
Those police are trying to take my baby girl's life away before it's even started!
She needs to be married and have babies and not be rotting away in some j-j-jail.
I'm not in jail anymore, mama.
For now.
But you still got the trial.
You know how those juries like to send black folks away.
No. No.
Mama, they dropped the charges.
The judge told me today.
That's why I'm here.
They did have enough evidence so they let me go.
No.
Mm-hmm.
-No.
-Yeah.
[ Laughing ] No.
[ Laughing ]
Yeah, I'm here!
It's over!
Oh!
I'm free, mama.
You hear me?
God.
Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you.
My baby girl.
[ Crying ]
Denver: You were right.
There seems to be a conspiracy in the Wes gibbins case.
Someone signed off on having his body transferred to another morgue.
It's someone on the inside.
Who is it?
You.
Nate: You circling a cause of death yet?
He was already dead, before the fire.
[ Engine turns off ]
Annalise?
Annalise?
[ Door closes ]
Hey.
Hey.
Â¶Â¶ keating:
Congratulations.
You've each been chosen for my very first criminal-law clinic.
In here, you're not just students but actual practicing lawyers.
You finally get to be me.
Â¶Â¶
 Thursdays on abc...
At least they chose a good photo.
...brace yourself for a mystery
 so killer...
This could destroy us all.
 ...not everyone is gonna
 make it out alive.
No!
 "How to get away with murder."
 Thursdays, 10:00, 9:00 central
 on abc.
Â¶Â¶ what are you looking for?
It's right here.
Well, damn.
 13 seasons
 of fun.
Gimme, gimme, gimme.
[ Coos ]
 13 seasons of drama.
This act was a felony.
It was nice knowing you.
Shut up.
 13 seasons of twisty turns...
It's bad.
You're falling for me.
I slept with him.
 ...like only "grey's"
 can deliver.
Damn right.
 "Grey's anatomy."
 Thursdays on abc.

## S03E13

Previously on "How to
Get Away with Murder"...
Somebody killed him, burned his body, and misplaced it!
- We're gonna find it.
- You better.
Otherwise, you're gonna have a lot of people thinking there's a conspiracy going on.
Say something else about my boys.
You didn't just neglect them. You molested them.
It looks worse than it feels.
They hurt you.
I erased Annalise's phone that night.
- I know.
- Yeah, but I saved a copy.
If you have anything to say, you need to say it through your lawyer.
I fired the guy. I'm gonna represent myself.
Someone signed off on having his body transferred
- to another morgue.
- Who is it?
You.
Hey.
Hey.
Hello?
Hey.
Damn.
Yeah, they got me pretty good.
Atwood's targeting me, too.
My signature ended up on the form to transfer Wes' body.
You sure it's her?
Yeah, I was asking too many questions.
- You need to go to Denver, tell him.
- I know.
I'm just not sure that's all they got on me.
Nate?
I was at your house that night.
Hey.
Annalise up there?
No.
Door was open.
The detectives let you go?
You're in on this.
No.
You should take the deal they're offering.
They're gonna take her down eventually.
For what?
Sinclair, Sam, framing me.
You sure you want to go down for all that?
She chooses herself every time.
You're wrong.
I've been in your place, thinking you owe her things.
I just need to talk to her.
- So she can play you again?
- She knew my mother.
He said you were looking out for him... ever since he was a kid... got him into law school.
She's not who people make her out to be.
Of course she is.
Then why has she protected me even when I didn't deserve it?
What's that mean?
I've done awful things to her.
Like...?
- Wes.
- Leave.
Lahey here.
Gibbins walked out on us.
You know anything about that?
Why would I?
You were standing outside of his interrogation room the last time I saw you, so...
I don't know where he is.
I left him there.
If anybody checks my phone, they'll see I was at the house that night.
Thank you for telling me.
Stop.
You didn't have to do that.
He died 'cause I left him there.
Don't thank me for anything.
We'll fix this.
I promise you.
We're gonna fix it.
Thank you all for coming.
I know you didn't have to.
You could have just... run off to Brazil already.
Is that really an option?
I failed.
I promised to protect you all, and I didn't.
I tried, but... the D.A. offered Wes immunity.
It would make sense to come to you next.
AK, come on. You know we all have your back.
We don't know that.
The D.A. really wants to take me down for this.
And I would imagine that anything that they offered would be hard to turn down.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry. Did you really call us here to beg us not to tattle on you?
No. And I'm sorry if it's coming off that way.
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
Laurel, please, just sit down.
Why aren't we talking about going after the people who killed Wes?
We don't know who killed him.
He testified against Charles Mahoney a week before he died.
It's not that simple.
It is... and we should do something.
These people are dangerous.
So what... we're just gonna sit around and act weak and victim-y?
No one's acting like a victim.
You are.
Have you said your piece? Can I go?
Hack it.
You hack it.
I don't know how, obviously.
Well, then, there's your answer.
Oliver, what if she's hiding something?
Then I think we should respect her wishes, and let it stay hidden.
Is that why you saved a copy?
Because I think you did because your gut's telling you that Annalise is being sketchy.
You didn't see her that night. She was a wreck.
Maybe 'cause she killed Wes.
Have you ever considered that?
You don't really believe that, do you?
I don't know what I believe.
That's why I'm asking you to go through what was on her phone.
If we don't find anything, great.
I have to look for a new job now that Annalise is pretty much fired.
Otherwise, we're both gonna be sleeping on Michaela's couch.
Well, you're not gonna need a job when the police find out you're sitting on illegally-obtained evidence.
What if we found out something terrible?
I'd rather stay blissfully ignorant.
This isn't about us,
Oliver. It's about Wes.
If Annalise had anything to do with him dying a horrible, horrible death, then the world needs to know that.
Hopefully, there's a
Nate peen pic on here, or something.
There's this case in Missouri.
It was a gang shooting.
They had three defendants charged with second-degree murder, until the police lost the body.
Judge threw out the whole case.
They lost the body before the M.E. did an autopsy in that case.
So we file some motion about them hiding evidence.
That's not how this works.
Why not?
The fact that you don't know is exactly why you should re-hire you lawyer.
Did you just imply I'm stupid?
You're acting stupid.
Even the fact that we're meeting here.
It makes it look like you and Annalise are colluding, which is... maybe what you want.
What's that supposed to mean?
I told you to go look for Wes at the house.
The next thing I hear... he's dead.
He wasn't at the house when I got there.
I'm innocent.
- Call your lawyer, hire him back.
- Not gonna happen.
Wait!
How's everyone doing?
Laurel's fine.
No! That's not... Bon!
Atwood's targeting me, too.
My signature ended up on the form to transfer Wes' body.
We'll fix this.
We're just gonna sit around and act weak and victim-y?
"Attention, Ingrid Peters, Esquire.
Pennsylvania office of the
Deputy Attorney General.
My name is Annalise Keating, and this is a demand letter seeking a grand-jury investigation into a conspiracy launched against me by the Philadelphia
District Attorney's office."
Howard?
Call me "Howie."
Got it.
"This letter serves as a formal complaint in petition for investigation into prosecutorial misconduct committed by A.D.A. Renee Atwood.
The following is a list of her unlawful actions.
Acting on personal bias and false information,
Ms. Atwood arrested and held me without probable cause, just by the confession by a career criminal,
Frank Delfino."
You know, this is a big case.
Well, that's why I'm paying you big bucks.
"A.D.A. Atwood orchestrated the disappearance of the victim's body, thereby tampering with evidence and obstructing a fair and impartial trial."
What do you think?
It's war.
Exactly.
"I demand you launch an immediate grand-jury investigation into A.D.A. Atwood. If no action is taken..."
"I will personally see to it that the corruption in this office is publicly and irreparably exposed."
These are big claims.
I was left with no other choice.
Actually, there are a lot of other choices besides invoking the power of the State.
I know my legal options.
I also know how important it is for the Attorney General's office to investigate any charges of prosecutorial misconduct.
Please, if every criminal in the state was allowed to file suit because their D.A. was being
- a little overzealous...
- Look at my face.
Do you not think this constitutes a lawsuit?
I'm sorry. Are you now claiming
A.D.A. Atwood physically assaulted you?
Worse!
She disappeared a young man's body in order to frame me for murder.
- Please do not raise your voice.
- Can you imagine what would happen if this got slipped to the press?
The corruption scandal that would follow your whole career?
There goes any chance at a judgeship or congressional seat.
Is that what you want?
This office does not tolerate threats.
Find that body.
Otherwise, it won't just be a threat.
I will not stand by and let baseless accusations be leveled at any of my prosecutors.
And I won't stand by while you frame my client for murder.
You think Ingrid Peters is gonna take
Keating's accusations seriously?
She better. Otherwise, we'll take it to the FBI.
There are bodies piling up around this woman, and you think she deserves justice?
- Renee...
- Excuse me?
What about that poor young man who was burnt to a crisp?
Where's his justice?
We'll see you at the grand jury.
We can hit you back, Ms. Winterbottom.
This office has files on everyone in Ms. Keating's life.
You, her students...
Are you really sure you want to go down this road?
We're already there.
They'll probably offer us the same deal as Wes.
I mean, we know everything that he did.
Dude, shut up.
I will go Red Wedding on anyone who rats out Annalise.
Even Laurel, because where is she?
She seemed pissed enough to go get herself a deal.
She's at home... grieving.
So she's at the police station.
Dude, the D.A. would have already come to us if they wanted to offer us a deal.
Mm, that's not true.
Okay, we've been back at school for five minutes.
Can we at least pretend to study?
So why haven't they approached us yet?
A million reasons, especially if this is a... conspiracy, like Annalise claims it is.
Stop talking. Annalise was closer to Wes than any of us.
Maybe it was a crime of passion, or...
I said to stop talking.
Oh, my God, do you think she has this room bugged?
Hello?
I can't make Laurel not be mad at you.
She gets to be mad right now, and whatever other emotions she's feeling.
It's called the grief process, so don't try and trick me into making you two besties or something.
- That's not why I called you here.
- Of course it is.
Can I just speak?
I know you, Annalise, and, yes,
I just called you Annalise, which I think is appropriate, considering where we are in our relationship.
You can call me whatever you want.
I just did. And frankly...
I am your biggest advocate right now.
So just admit what you need rather than whatever game this is.
You're right.
Okay? You're right.
Bonnie said you've been holding everyone up.
That doesn't surprise me.
I'm just... sorry that you're in this position.
But it is what it is right now.
You're the one they listen to, so...
I'm just asking if there's anyone
I need to be worried about right now.
Everyone's fine.
You sure?
Yes.
Because like you just said,
I've been cleaning up all your mess while you've been in jail.
Is that all?
Okay.
So, you admit that's your signature?
- Yes.
- But you didn't sign it?
Nope.
So you think someone who had access to your signature
- forged this?
- Seems that way.
Do you have theories about who forged it?
Can't say.
You got the State involved?!
I told them to look into Atwood.
- Well, now she's looking into me.
- Your signature is on that form.
You were gonna be investigated either way.
Not by the State!
You seriously think this lady's gonna charge her own prosecutor?
She will once she finds out they're setting you up.
If she finds out! We don't know how high this goes!
- Nate...
- These people only protect their own.
I know these people, how to manage them.
Maybe before... but they think you're a joke now.
Stop trying to help me.
It only makes things worse.
We could pull the complaint.
No.
Find out where Oliver is.
Mind if I come in?
Of course not. Yeah.
Connor told me you got out on bail, which I guess is cause for congratulations.
Or something.
Is everything okay?
That depends.
On...?
If we're still good.
"Good"?
Well, a lot has changed since we last spoke.
Yeah, well, not for me.
Well, let me just say this...
Oliver... there's no reason for you to protect me.
We both know that... but you've been very steady.
And it means a lot to me, especially right now.
It means a lot to me, too.
So... is it the D.A.'s office again?
You need me to do a little hacky McHackerson for you?
It's easier than that.
Janice said you needed me?
Look.
This bitch.
I'm no joke.
Castillo!
Open the door, or I'll call your landlord.
Hey. We brought, uh, cookies.
Oh, I'm not hungry.
Everyone's hungry for dessert.
Come on. Yummy, yummy, yummy in your tummy, tummy, tummy.
Who's in there?
Uh, no one.
Michaela!
Who are you?
Uh... a friend.
I'll be in touch.
- Wait, are you banging that dude?
- No.
Banging him is fine.
Doing other things is not.
Who is he?
Private investigator.
- Are you a moron?
- What, like "Veronica Mars"?
Before you yell at me... look at what he found.
Sylvia Mahoney submitted
DNA to a lab for analysis five days before Wes' death.
So? My whole family had that done.
Actually, I found out that I have some Japanese
- in my genes.
- She did the DNA test on Wes, idiot.
They must have found out he was Wallace's son.
That's why they killed him.
Hello?
Annalise. Hi. So, it's true?
- You got out on bail?
- Yeah.
That's great.
Isn't it?
Of course. I'm relieved.
Everything okay?
Yes, everything's fine.
I just called the minute I heard.
The Board's nervous, right?
What?
They think I'm gonna ask to go back to work.
- Tell them to relax. I know I'm fired.
- No.
I'm crazy, but I'm not so crazy to think that they'd let me within 100 yards of that campus.
Look, just don't think about any of that right now.
You're out of jail.
And that's a great thing, so... do you need anything... clothes, help finding a place to stay?
No, I'm good.
I actually have an appointment about to start, so...
Oh, okay.
Just call me if you need anything... or if you want to go to a meeting.
I will.
Talk.
Laurel hired a private investigator.
He found this.
The Mahoneys ran a DNA test on Wes.
They knew who he was.
Possibly.
You're just like Wes. You dig when I tell you not to.
You ask questions about things you can't understand.
This proves they killed Wes.
No, what it proves is, you don't listen.
What did I tell you about these people? Tell me what I said.
This could mean that Atwood is working with the Mahoneys to frame you.
You could take this to the police.
- The police who are trying to set me up?
- You can at least try.
These people will hurt us, all of us. That's what they did to me.
I was pregnant, eight months, and they murdered my baby.
I was just like you... just trying to do the right thing, stood up to them... and they destroyed my life.
We have to do whatever it takes to stay safe.
That's what's important right now.
Wes deserved so much better than you.
Hi. Um...
Laurel didn't mean that.
Yes, she did. But that's all right.
I'm sorry about your baby.
And, uh... Wes, too.
I...
I know how close you both were, and... this all... this all just really... sucks.
Anyway, maybe I shouldn't have said anything.
I... I just want to let you know that I haven't forgotten about what you did for me.
Asher.
Yeah?
You don't need to worry about me.
Yeah, you should listen to her.
Worry about Laurel, the D.A.'s office coming after us, not Annalise.
She's a human being.
At the very least, she deserves our sympathy.
Oh.
Say, "She's a human and deserves our sympathy."
You have my sympathy because you're a blind, trusting fool.
- Micky?
- I told you never to call me that.
Yeah, I know.
I was hoping it would disarm you for what I'm about to say.
What if Connor was the anonymous source?
- What?
- Think about it, why it took him so long to show up at the hospital that night.
He was sexing Thomas.
Or he was at the police station signing his own immunity deal.
No. We're not doing this.
Okay, well, why does he keep pushing us to turn on Annalise?
Okay, do you know why families turn on each other?
Because one family member starts talking crap about another family member.
And then boom, it's "The Borgias."
- I'm just saying, we should ask him...
- Mm!
You will do nothing of the sort.
You will forget we ever had this conversation and promise to never bring it up again.
Yes?
Michaela...
Unh!
The only appropriate answer here is to nod.
A dead baby is pretty much the only guaranteed thing to make you feel bad for someone.
You're being so mean.
Well, this is Annalise we're talking about.
Yeah, but people rarely make up stories about their dead children, so... maybe you could...
I don't know... believe the poor woman for once, especially with the way her face is looking right now.
How do you know how her face looks?
Was she here?
Why?
She needed me to leak that article.
Are you sure?
Yes. What's your problem?
You don't... think it's a little convenient that she came over at the exact same time that you're hacking her phone?
No, I think you're being paranoid.
And you're being naive.
Okay, I'm being naive.
And yet, here I am, going through her phone records because you wanted me to.
By the way, you never told me that she called you over to the house that night.
Uh, yeah, I did.
No, I knew she left a message for Laurel and Wes, but not you.
I got the voicemail the next day.
Why are you asking me about this?
No reason.
No naked Nate pics, huh?
Straight people are so boring.
You can all stop stalking me.
It's not like I'm gonna go crazy or anything.
No one would blame you if you did.
You've been through a lot.
I'm fine.
Good.
I'll tell Frank.
He asked about you.
Did you know her when she was pregnant?
I was a 1-L.
Was she happy?
Happier.
I can make you an appointment.
If you make a decision that you're worried people will judge you for.
Annalise.
We can tell her you had a miscarriage.
You're just as bad as her.
Hello?
You are receiving a call from an inmate
at Philadelphia County Prison.
This call is being recorded.
To accept the charges, press 3.
Bonnie?
You there?
We're being recorded.
Look... Bonnie,
I've been thinking about things, and...
I just want you to know that...
I'm doing everything I can for our case.
So if you need anything from me... at all... I'm here to help.
Whatever you want.
Yes?
It's Ingrid Peters.
I'm rejecting your request for a grand-jury investigation.
Excuse me?
You leaked this article to the press.
I didn't have anything to do with a leaked article.
Let me be blunt. If you continue to spread these ridiculous conspiracy theories about the D.A.'s office,
I will order Mr. Denver to go not only for life in prison on your case, but the death penalty.
That is what I call a threat.
_
_
_
So, I guess you're my sponsor now.
Oh. Don't say that.
Makes it sound too official.
Thank you.
Sorry I can't take your case after all that.
That's fine.
No. It's not.
'Cause your only real chance of winning was if I was representing you, so...
You good?
How's your case going?
You don't have to talk about it.
It's a good sign that you're out on bail, though, right?
I thought you said we didn't have to talk about this.
I'm sorry. I...
I just can't imagine what you must be going through.
Oh!
Um... so there's a huge controversy going on about the naming rights for the new wing of the law library.
Why are you here?
I just came to make sure you were okay.
We can't have a glorified accident attorney as our namesake.
Just call me if you need anything.
What did she offer you?
Excuse me?
Atwood.
Did she promise to get you custody of your kids?
Don't make me feel like a bigger fool than I already do.
They're my children.
You'd do the same thing if you were in my shoes.
We should just kill her.
What?
Atwood. She's a cancer.
The important thing is, you found out.
What does that get me?
Peace of mind while I go to jail for the rest of my life?
Tell them Nate was at the house that night.
I can just suggest they look at his phone records.
No.
It gives them another suspect who isn't you.
Is this really who you want to be?
The people who burn down everything around them, everyone around them?
I don't.
I'm going to bed.
Bonnie?
Frank have a lawyer yet?
Where's Oliver?
He's at home, looking for a new job.
Which is a better use of time than us being here.
The judge needs to see that the people that loved Wes
- think Annalise is innocent.
- Do we think she's innocent?
Here he goes again.
- Stop.
- Stop what?
Why don't you say "Hi" to your buddy Atwood over there?
You could thank her for the deal she got you.
- What deal?
- He's drunk, and judge is coming.
So put your penises away.
Mr. Delfino, since you've called us all here today, why don't we let you begin.
Thank you, Your Honor.
I'd like to file a subpoena duces tecum for all of A.D.A. Atwood's personal correspondence on the day the victim's body was lost.
Objection, Your Honor.
Ms. Atwood's correspondence is protected from disclosure by the Work Product Doctrine.
An exception has to be made when there's a missing body, no?
Our people are closing in on where the body is.
Yeah, but at that point, the chain of custody will be broken, all because A.D.A. Atwood lost the body on purpose.
Mr. Delfino is only arguing this motion at the direction of Annalise Keating, who was warned about such actions.
Your Honor, my client has had no communication with Mr. Delfino.
Oh, please, Ms. Winterbottom went to visit Mr. Delfino this morning.
Yes, to convince him to re-hire his lawyer, so it wouldn't look like we were colluding, which, ironically, we're now being accused of.
This was all my idea, Judge.
I'm a little offended Mr. Denver's trying to give someone else credit.
All right, let me stop you right there, Mr. Delfino.
Without concrete evidence of your theory, the law says Ms. Atwood's private communications cannot be subpoenaed.
I have evidence. He just didn't let me get to that part.
Get it, Frank.
This is the victim's
Morgue Transfer sheet, signed by an investigator hired by Ms. Atwood's office,
Nate Lahey.
This is proof Mr. Lahey moved and hid the body from Ms. Atwood.
Mr. Lahey does not work on this case, Judge.
He's Ms. Atwood's boyfriend.
Doesn't that matter?
Is this true, Ms. Atwood?
You have a romantic relationship with Mr. Lahey?
We were at some point, but it ended before this case.
Were you aware of such a relationship, Mr. Denver?
The D.A.'s office imposes no restrictions on its staff regarding workplace relationships.
Mr. Delfino, though ill-advised,
A.D.A. Atwood and Mr.
Lahey broke no laws.
What about the Sixth Amendment?
That's the one that says every defendant has the right to a fair trial, correct?
Well, what's happening here?
The prosecution's tampering with evidence, showing bias, not to mention they got tons of conflict of interest.
That's the opposite of fair.
It's just a damn subpoena, Your Honor.
Watch your language, Mr. Delfino.
Sorry.
But you did hit on a valid point.
Mr. Delfino is correct in that even just the appearance of bias can waive the D.A.'s protection from disclosure.
Only in extreme cases, Judge.
I find this to be one of those.
I'm granting the subpoena.
Ms. Atwood, you are hereby ordered to turn over your e-mails, calls, and text messages for the day the body was transferred.
You have jeopardized this case and the integrity of my office.
Every shred of evidence that you have been in contact with, now comes into question.
And all because you needed to get laid!
I can fix this. If you just give me a chance...
Are you kidding? You are suspended!
You will give me those records so I can prepare for what is coming down the line.
I can tell you what's coming.
This was the only way we could get at Atwood.
And it's gonna hit her harder than it hits you.
- Annalise.
- It's hard to trust me.
- God knows...
- It worked.
Atwood admitted she moved Wes' body.
I'm in the clear.
Did they find the body?
Hi.
Wow.
You came all the way over here, and you still don't know what to say to me?
How about this.
"I'm sorry, Laurel."
You could start there.
Laurel...
What?
Wes was cremated.
Isn't this good?
I mean, not that it's good. It's sad.
But if he's cremated, then we can get AK's charges dropped.
I mean, any jury's gonna find that sketchy.
Our it just means Annalise can't prove she didn't do this.
Is that true?
I don't know.
Where is Annalise?
- None of your business.
- Now that's sketchy.
Do you have a problem?
Because I understand why
Laurel might be acting like a little bitch right now, but not you.
- You have no idea.
- Asher...
No, BonBon needs to hear this.
'Cause you know why I think family's get torn apart?
- Because secrets.
- Ignore him. He's tired.
No, what is this secret, Asher?
No, I'm leaving if this is about to turn into another brawl.
I think Connor's the anonymous source.
So, Atwood's working with the Mahoneys, like I said.
It's possible.
It's true.
We shouldn't jump to any conclusions right now.
What happened to you in there?
It's jail. I get it. It's horrible.
But it's your life we're talking about.
If you don't care about Wes, I get that.
But care about yourself.
I care about Wes.
You don't need to say that just 'cause you think it sounds good.
I'm still in shock that he's gone.
He's not your son. I get it.
You don't need to cry about him in front of me.
But I do need you to take action.
Yeah, I do need you to be the person that you promised us you were.
You know, that's why we've been following you this whole time and trusting you.
Because you said that you knew what you were doing!
But now one of us just got killed, and we need to find out who did that!
Where's your proof?
Your behavior's my proof.
What the hell does that even mean?
You keep saying that Annalise did this, even though all the evidence points to the fact that it was the Mahoneys.
You keep saying Annalise did this?
He's exaggerating.
No, he's not.
You would defend your stupid boyfriend.
Even since Wes died, all you've done is point the finger at Annalise, which is suspicious behavior.
The first thing guilty people do is try to blame someone else.
Like a fart. If you smelt it, you dealt it.
Fine, I think there's quite a good chance that Annalise did this.
- Why?
- Her phone.
That she had Oliver clear.
Because it holds information about a lot of bad things we all do.
That doesn't mean that one of them
- was killing Wes.
- Are you sure?
Yes!
'Cause I'm about to have proof.
Oliver kept a copy of Annalise's phone and has been going through it.
- Are you kidding?
- What?!
Are you sure you want to keep denying Annalise's involvement?
You think I don't care about him?
You really think that?
I don't know.
He wasn't my son.
Maybe it would be easier if he was.
Then I would know... how I feel... what I feel right now.
All I know is that it's horrific... and I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I'm just... I'm so angry.
I know.
He deserved so much better than this.
He did.
I promise you that we're gonna find who did this to him.
We owe him that.
Hey.
Hey, so, uh... I did something kind of stupid.
Oli?
All this time, you've been telling me
Annalise was hiding something when you're the one with the secret.
What are you talking about?
You checked your voicemail that night.
I kept wondering why it took you so long to get to the hospital.
I just figured you were with Thomas the whole time, boning for six hours.
So I called him.
He said that you left his apartment hours before the fire, and that you used his cellphone to check your voicemail.
You went to Annalise's house that night, didn't you?
1, 2, 3, 4.

## S03E14

Previously on "How To
Get Away With Murder"...
- He died 'cause I left him there.
- We'll fix this.
This is proof Mr. Lahey moved and hid the body from Miss Atwood.
I can fix this. If you just give me a chance...
Are you kidding? You are suspended!
Atwood admitted she moved Wes' body.
Why aren't we talking about going after the people who killed Wes?
We don't know who killed him.
He testified against Charles Mahoney a week before he died.
Laurel. Wes was cremated.
Oliver: All this time, you've been telling me Annalise was hiding something when you're the one with a secret.
You went to Annalise's house that night, didn't you?
1, 2, 3, 4.
Woman: It was my fault.
I say that to myself so that maybe I'll start to believe it
[sighs] and feel bad.
Because I'll admit, right now,
I don't feel that bad.
It's like my brain just broke... all the way.
And I can't get that image of her out of my head.
Woman ##2: I keep having this dream...
Cars crashing into a convenience store, and there's all these people trapped underneath.
They're screaming at me the most vile things that you've ever heard.
Woman: Like, why can't I just be happy for once?
"Pile of trash, You ugly whore."
- Mistake after stupid mistake.
- It's just stuck...
- Why do I have to always be...
- in a constant loop.
Worrying about everyone else?
- I just want to throw up.
- "Disgusting, repulsive,
- "dried-up, old bitch."
- Hate me.
- I hate it.
- I deserve it.
It's just enough to make me want to die.

<font color=##FFFF00>"He Made a Terrible Mistake"</font>
- Would you like to share?
- No.
You sure? We're good listeners.
I'm new.
But you already know that, so...
[Breathes deeply]
And I have a problem... with drinking, yes.
But I got other problems, too...
Lots of them.
Like, I could take up this entire meeting talking about them, and you would be entertained.
Trust me.
But everyone's got problems.
I mean, that's all you hear in these meetings...
Men who can't afford to eat, women who get beat up.
There was even a woman in here whose 6-year-old daughter died in a school shooting.
I mean, the world is ugly.
People get depressed, and so they drink.
That's clear.
But, I don't know.
Sitting in these rooms, talking about it...
I don't know.
[Groans lightly] It's just...
[Sighs]
I mean, look at you.
You've been coming here for 26 years, and y-you're still a mess.
I mean, what has coming here done for you?
I mean, tell me!
There's got to be something that you learned... something...
Right, that you helps you to feel better... other than this whining.
[Sniffles]
I mean, tell me.
Tell me what it is.
Man ##2: Have you tried meditation?
[Sniffles]
I'll think about it.
[Knock on door]
Oliver: Where have you been?
- [Panting] Running.
- For two hours?
You'll be the one that benefits when I have abs.
Y-You left your phone. It kept ringing.
I saw it was Bonnie, so I answered it.
There's a hearing for Annalise tomorrow to get her charges dropped, and they want you there.
[Sighs]
Maybe you should tell them.
They won't believe me.
Well, I believe you.
Do you?
Yeah.
That's convincing.
Why are you ignoring my texts?
I've been busy.
Busy ratting us out to the fuzz?
Would I be here if I did?
I don't know. Maybe they put a wire on you.
[Loudly] Copy that, officers?
I didn't go to the cops.
Did Oliver find something on Annalise's phone?
- Is that what you don't want to say?
- No.
- Then what's wrong?
- Nothing.
- Why are you lying?
- 'Cause he's always doing it.
I brought you here to fill the seats behind Annalise, not to bicker.
Do I have anything to worry about?
Yeah.
Worry about wasting Annalise's time with this impossible motion to dismiss.
We win this, and all of our problems go away, including yours.
So get in there, sit down, and act like you actually like Annalise.
Bonnie: Is it true you were fired from the District Attorney's office, Ms. Atwood?
Yes.
Why?
I forged a signature on the form ordering the transfer of Wesley Gibbins' body.
The signature of an investigator from your office... Nate Lahey?
Yes.
Can you explain to the court why you would tamper with evidence this way?
Objection... argumentative.
It's probative to the key issue of my motion...
Malicious prosecution.
Overruled.
I wasn't tampering with evidence.
I was protecting it.
How does transferring a body protect evidence?
Ms. Keating has a history of committing unlawful actions to win her cases.
I was trying to protect all of our evidence.
Now.
Transferring the body broke chain of custody, according to Rule 901.
Anyone, including you, could have manipulated the evidence.
But we will never be able to prove that, because after transferring the body, you also ordered its cremation.
- Isn't that true?
- Objection...
- Assuming facts not in evidence.
- Sustained.
Bonnie.
[Scribbling]
As I'm sure you're aware, the Rule of Spoliation states that you may not benefit from the destruction of evidence.
I never meant to.
Intent is irrelevant.
Your Honor, who is trying the case here?
Ms. Keating, either act as your own counsel or advise your lawyer on your own time.
[Sighs]
Ms. Atwood, did you or did you not order the cremation of Wesley Gibbins' body?
I did not.
Do you know who ordered the cremation of Wesley Gibbins?
No.
- Because you're lying under oath?
- No.
Objection... She's goading the witness.
Jacobs: Sustained.
No further questions.
Michaela: She just perjured herself in there, right?
- Of course.
- So we need to break her.
We would've if I was the one asking the questions.
We go back in tomorrow, so everyone come back to my house, and we'll figure out ways to prove she lied.
Has anyone considered the possibility that Atwood has nothing to do with this?
Of course she does.
The Mahoneys killed Wes and got
Atwood to help them cover it up.
- Why would she do that?
- Why does anyone do anything?
Money, son.
When you have Mahoney's cash, you can get people to do anything.
You can kill their pets, have sex with creepy, old guys.
- Annalise...
- So, you're saying you'd sleep with an old man if someone paid you enough?
Uh, with my bank account in its current state, yeah, I would.
Laurel: Annalise.
Charles Mahoney just got released from jail.
- [Camera shutters clicking]
- I can't express how relieved we are that the prosecution finally realized that the charges against me were manufactured.
Woman: Do you have plans to sue the state for wrongful prosecution?
No.
Right now, I just want to go home,
spend some time with my family.
Mrs. Mahoney, are you happy to put this all behind you?
Sylvia: No, because it isn't behind us.
Man: Can you tell us what you mean by that?
What'd I tell you?
They probably paid off a judge to get him released.
Shh!
My husband's murder is still unsolved.
So, while one nightmare might be over,
we are still deep in the middle of another.
I owe it to my husband to find the person
or persons who shot him dead in the middle of the street.
- Turn it off.
- [TV clicks]
Great, so, we sit here and wait for her to come kill us, too.
She's not gonna kill us.
- She's gonna pay someone to kill us.
- No one's getting killed.
You said so yourself that these chuckleheads are dangerous.
But Atwood isn't.
She's the weak link.
And if we find proof that she had any contact with the Mahoneys, they all go down.
And isn't that what you want, to find out who killed Wes and how to make them pay?
So, that's what we do.
We don't stand around here complaining.
We act.
So let's get to work.
- You wanted to see me?
- Close the door.
Denver: I saw you in court today. Who were you there for?
Atwood? Or is it Annalise these days?
I was there 'cause this is my case.
That the only reason?
'Cause this case has been damaged enough by my A.D.A. tampering with the victim's body.
- I had nothing to do with that.
- I know that now.
But this whole department is under a microscope.
So I need you to look me in the eye and tell me that you are not in contact with Keating.
We've been done for a long time now.
I'm not here to play games, so either trust me or fire me.
No one's getting fired.
Good.
What's this?
Atwood's Wi-Fi password.
She works out of her home office sometimes, so if she had any secret communications, she'd do it from there.
You're welcome.
If Denver finds out that you're helping me,
- it could hurt both of us.
- Don't worry about that.
My ass could go to jail for the rest of my life.
It's my job to worry about everything right now.
Why do you think I'm here?
Say "thank you."
This is Atwood's Wi-Fi password.
Get into her computer, phone records, bank statements, anything that'll link her to the Mahoneys.
Well, you got her password.
That saves me about an hour.
The rest of you, dig into the discovery of my case...
Police records, interviews.
Chances are Atwood doctored some of those, too.
Oh, God.
That's not for you.
What is it?
It's a file that's better for Michaela.
I have no idea what you're doing.
No, no, no, please, don't. Please do...
He looks better than I thought.
You okay?
Yeah.
What's going on with you?
Nothing.
You can't even look me in the eye.
'Cause you're so blindingly beautiful.
You're mad at me for taking Asher's side.
Fine. I get that.
But I think the two of us know better than to let some boy ever come between us.
The only way I've gotten through any of this insanity is because we had each other's backs.
There's nothing you can't say to me.
I'm having coming-out flashbacks.
[Scoffs]
What is it?
I got into Atwood's landline records.
Okay, so, she received a call from this phone number on the night Wes died.
She got another call from that same number on the day that she had Wes' body moved and again on the night that he was cremated.
It's a blocked number.
It's probably a burner, which means it's impossible to...
Laurel: To what?
Uh... I'm sorry.
There's no way for me to find out whose number this is.
- Unless we call it.
- We can't.
Asher: Why not?
If the Mahoneys or one of their goons picked up, then we'd know they're in cahoots with Atwood.
Annalise: And lets them know that we're on to them.
Keep digging. See if you can trace the number to anyone.
Um, I told you, I can't.
Oliver, now, you've done a lot of things this year you thought you couldn't do.
- They'll believe you.
- [Whispers] Shut up.
What's going on?
- Nothing.
- Michaela.
I'm just not feeling very well.
What happened? Did you say something to her?
- Asher.
- Connor: No.
You can be an ass to me all you want but not to my lady.
Asher, I think you're probably reading into things.
He's not. Michaela.
- Just tell them.
- Tell us what?
Laurel: Yeah, seriously, what's going on?
Uh, I think we should just give Connor some space.
- Open your mouth.
- Connor might've killed Wes.
You know, you're much nicer on HumpR.
That's 'cause I wanted to get laid.
[Chuckles]
You know what?
You're the problem with the gay community.
You know, we all just treat each other like a piece of meat.
We're all the problem with the gay community.
It was nice meeting you.
- [Door opens]
- [Scoffs]
Hey, I realized I don't have my phone.
Could I borrow yours?
[Chuckles]
Wow. You're on a roll.
[Cellphone beeps]
Annalise: Connor, it's Annalise.
I need all of you to come to the house.
I got your voice-mail.
So I went to the house.
It was open.
Hello? Annalise?
Annalise?
Connor: I went in the basement.
That's where I found him.
Wes?
Wes!
Wes. Wes, wake up.
Come on.
Help! Annalise!
He didn't have a pulse.
Or maybe I just couldn't find it. I don't know.
But his body was still warm, so I started CPR.
- Why didn't you call 911?
- Because I didn't have my phone.
- There was a phone in the house.
- You weren't there.
You don't understand. I...
[Gasps] I tried to save him.
Connor: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Breathe.
Come on, Wes! Breathe!
He wouldn't breathe, so I-I kept doing the... the compressions.
But then...
[Bone cracks]
There was, like, a... like a crack, like a bone or... or rib or something.
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe that's what killed him, you know, maybe, like, a... a bone punctured his lung or something.
No, no, Connor, h-he was hurt before you got there.
- Hey, do not baby him right now!
- Connor, Connor, Connor.
Did you see if he was hurt?
- No.
- Are you sure?
Because that would help us figure out how he died.
I didn't see anything! He just... He just looked dead.
Yeah, 'cause you left him there to die!
There was gas! I smelled gas.
Whoever killed him cut the gas line.
- You mean you cut the gas line.
- Laurel.
- Oh, God, Laurel.
- I swear I didn't do this!
How are we supposed to believe you right now?
Oliver: Look at him!
Look how guilty he feels.
Yeah, maybe 'cause he killed him.
Stop it.
Why are you just telling us this now?
Because he was afraid of this, that you would think he did it, when the truth is he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Yeah, maybe that's what he wants us to believe.
Will you stop attacking him, please?
All of you have done terrible things, and you have asked me to believe that you did them for the right reasons.
Well, now you need to do the same thing for Connor.
- Yeah, he hated Wes.
- No, I didn't.
- You blamed him for everything!
- Annalise: Quiet.
- Please, Laurel, you're just making it worse!
- I couldn't kill anyone!
So, you know what you need to do right now?
- You need to go and kill yourself.
- Laurel, stop.
That's the one good thing you're gonna do in your life.
You're gonna go, and you're gonna kill yourself, Connor!
[Gasps]
[Footsteps approach]
Today's a good day for you.
- [Door closes]
- How's that?
We're offering you a plea deal.
Admit Annalise ordered you to kill Wes, and you'll be out in seven years.
Your case against
Annalise is in the toilet.
Maybe it's time you just give up.
If the judge throws out Annalise's case, my office is gonna have to come up with an alternative theory... like... you and Laurel Castillo killed Wes.
She was in the house that night, as were you, according to your confession.
Love triangle gone wrong.
What do you have on her?
Sign the deal, and no one ever has to know.
[Sighs]
Bonnie: You could've kept
Annalise out of jail.
How?
By telling the police that she wasn't at the house that night.
[Sniffles] That doesn't mean she didn't do this.
Bonnie told you, right?
This whole time, I've been telling everyone that you killed Wes.
You should be begging her not to kill you right now, not attacking her.
Why don't you let her speak for herself?
So... was it you?
You killed him?
Leave, Bonnie.
Go.
Bonnie: Move.
- [Door closes]
- Now.
This is grief.
You're trying to make sense out of things that don't make sense, choosing a target for your anger.
- You still haven't answered my question.
- You know the answer.
I don't.
Every bad thing that we've done starts with you.
You're confused.
Or I just don't know how to bite my tongue anymore!
Laurel's right. You're deflecting.
- You are.
- I never killed anyone.
- Neither have I!
- You hacked up my husband, dumped his body in a garbage bin.
Because of Wes, okay?!
We were all trying to help him and you.
There you go again, deflecting.
No, no, no, you two dragged us into your Oedipal crap
- and we've all been trying to clean it up!
- You should've left!
- I tried.
- Well, you bailed on that plan because your boyfriend wouldn't run away with you.
I was trying to protect him from you.
You couldn't stand the idea of spending one second alone.
You don't know anything about me.
Well, I know you're paranoid and broken, haven't trusted anyone since you were a little boy.
I know what you're trying to do right now.
And you're still acting like that little boy, making up ugly stories about people because you're scared of anyone actually getting to know you.
Oh, God, you're so desperate for that kid!
So you blame me for the mess that's been in your head since the day you were born!
All your sons are dead!!
They're all dead!
And you can't use me to replace them.
Look me in the eye.
Right here.
You said you didn't hurt Wes.
So I believe you.
But I need you to believe me, too.
Forgive him.
No.
Annalise: He made a terrible mistake, just like we all have at one point, but he apologized.
I don't care. Wes is still gone.
But it's not Connor's fault.
It's whoever killed him, and that's where your anger needs to be going right now.
Otherwise, this boy right here is gonna kill himself and we'll all have more blood on our hands.
Is that what you want?
Forgive him.
He had some big file on Laurel.
- He's bluffing.
- But what if he's not?
He told you he's investigating all the kids, right?
To intimidate us.
Don't fall for it.
And don't do anything without talking to me.
Of course not.
Bonnie: Where are you going?
To buy a gun so that I can use it on Connor.
I have an OB appointment. [Sighs]
Still pregnant.
I really think that we should call the mystery number.
I can block my cell. There's no way they'll know it's mine.
You heard Annalise. No.
[Tablet beeps]
[Engine starts]
Nate: Atwood was just in New York.
She parked in a garage in the Financial District.
- When?
- Today.
Right after Charles
Mahoney was released.
Hello?
Was that a thank you?
No.
When the judge asks me how I got the information, should I just tell them that you broke into her car?
I'm doing everything I can, Annalise.
- No, you're not.
- Excuse me?
[Sighs]
You should just talk to her.
You think she's gonna confess to me?
Well, she fell for your moves before.
Or are you not as charming as you used to be?
Okay. I'm gonna hang up.
Was that Nate?
We need all the help we can get.
Wait.
What if Connor isn't telling us everything?
[Sighs]
Is there really no vodka in the house?
No.
[Sighs]
Dr. Huang: There's the yolk sac.
That thicker area there is the fetal pole.
And... there you are.
The heartbeat.
[Heart beating]
[Monitor clicks]
It's a big decision.
[Scoffs] Yeah.
[Sighs] How much time do I have?
Pennsylvania allows abortions up until 24 weeks.
Just know the law requires you to have a consultation with counselors where all your options are laid on the table
24 hours prior to the termination.
Right.
Meggy.
Hey.
Hey.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I just, uh...
I came to a doctor's appointment.
Being back here made me think of you.
Really?
Because I thought that we weren't friends.
[Sighs] Meggy...
Do you know that Michaela and them wouldn't even talk to me at Wes' memorial?
That wasn't about you.
They were just really worried about how I lost my mind up there on the altar.
I'm sorry.
I just... I miss him, and
I know that you do, too, which is why I shouldn't have shut you out.
It's just this whole situation's made me really paranoid.
Of me?
[Scoffs]
Of everyone.
Forgive me?
The bitch is spotless.
We've been through every file we have on Atwood... twice.
There's nothing that makes her look stupid.
I couldn't track the phone number, either.
- Sorry.
- Guys, what about this?
It says, "Stop being a weenie and call the mystery number"!
We're not calling the number.
What about asking your dad?
No.
I have an idea.
There's nothing in Wes' autopsy about the cracked rib, so you can put me on the stand, and I'll tell the truth.
It'll prove that the
M.E. lied in her report and invalidate the D.A.'s entire case.
That could make Denver think you killed Wes.
Yeah, but it'll get Annalise off.
Okay, I know you think you have to do this, but...
I want to.
There's no other way.
You have to let me do this.
I can't let you take the stand.
Thank God.
But Laurel can, though.
Mr. Gibbins' blood test showed an abnormally high CO2 level, and I observed petechiae, which are small hemorrhages around his cornea and on the lining of his larynx.
The presence of those two factors led me to conclude that Mr.
Gibbins' cause of death was asphyxiation by smoke inhalation.
Bonnie: During your exam, did you observe any other serious injuries on Mr. Gibbins' body?
No.
Really?
Nothing that would result from a struggle or a fall?
Objection... Asked and answered.
Merely asking the witness to clarify, Your Honor.
Apart from the third-degree burns sustained postmortem,
I observed no other traumatic injuries.
No further questions.
Jacobs: Mr. Denver?
Nothing from our side, Your Honor.
Great, that was the last witness on your list.
Correct, Ms. Winterbottom?
Actually, we have a new witness we'd like to call to the stand.
She was the other victim in the fire... Laurel Castillo.
Objection... Ms. Castillo is a critical witness for the State.
New evidence about that night has come to Ms. Castillo's recollection.
The State objects, Your Honor.
I've had no time to prepare a cross.
Mr. Denver has just stated that she is a critical witness to the State, which means he should be prepared to question her.
I'll be prepared for the trial.
The point of this hearing is to determine whether there will even be a trial, Mr. Denver.
Please step up, Ms. Castillo.
[Birds chirping]
[Sighs] Why are you here?
You know why.
Tell me or I'll call 911 right now.
How long have the Mahoneys been paying you off?
The Mahoneys?
Then who asked you to cremate Wes' body?
I didn't order his body cremated.
We're not in court anymore. No need to lie.
Everything I said under oath was true.
You don't believe me, I don't care.
Nate: Why were you in
New York yesterday?
You're following me now?
I didn't say that.
I had a job interview with Anthony and Levin to try and salvage what's left of my career after Annalise destroyed it.
You destroyed your career the minute you forged my signature.
And I have been kicking myself about that ever since.
I don't need you kicking me, too.
You wouldn't be in this mess unless someone was twisting your arm.
I told you... There is no one.
Someone's gonna find out the truth.
And they might not be as understanding as me.
You're looking out for yourself.
So am I.
Don't come here again.
Why did you contact the defense today, Ms. Castillo?
Laurel: To tell the truth.
Who did you lie to?
The police.
Bonnie: Why?
Because I didn't know who I could trust.
But now that I know that the D.A. hid Wes' body,
I know that I was right.
What were you too afraid to tell the police?
That I saw Wes... in the house before the fire.
[Voice breaking] He was in the basement. He was unconscious.
But his body was still warm, so I-I started CPR.
For how long?
A minute or more.
And I kept wanting to get him to breathe, so I just kept pressing on his chest.
Um... [Sighs]
But then, I must've... I must've pressed too hard,
'cause then I, uh, I heard a bone break.
What you're describing is a rib fracture, Ms. Castillo.
But the medical examiner testified that there were no other injuries.
That's a lie.
- Motion to strike.
- He was dead before the fire.
Why are you hiding that?
Jacobs: Please don't address the D.A.
Why are you concealing how he died?!
Unless you want to be held in contempt, Ms. Castillo,
I'm advising you to calm down.
[Sniffles] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
[Breathes deeply]
No further questions.
You're a law student,
Ms. Castillo, so I assume that means you can define
"perjury" for the court?
[Sighs, sniffles]
Perjury is the crime of lying under oath.
Very good.
Did you learn that at Middleton, or have you committed perjury before?
I'm not lying.
Really?
So, you've never lied to legal authorities before?
Hmm.
[Sniffles]
Well, answer the question.
Denver: Answer the question.
Objection, Your Honor.
On what grounds, Mr. Delfino?
Um...
I object, Your Honor, on the grounds of hearsay.
The D.A. is referring to a supposed out-of-court statement of which we have no proof.
Here's the proof, Your Honor.
The prosecution enters into evidence this affidavit from the Federal
District of Mexico City.
It contains a statement from Ms. Castillo confessing that she made a false claim of kidnapping as a teenager.
Objection, Your Honor.
The D.A. is presenting improper character evidence.
Ms. Castillo, is this your signature on this statement?
Hm.
[Sniffles] It is.
[Sighs]
Jacobs: Then your objection overruled, Ms. Winterbottom.
Continue.
Denver: Do you admit to fabricating a story about getting kidnapped?
I can explain.
I'm not asking for an explanation,
- just a yes or no.
- It's not as simple as that.
Did you or did you not sign that document admitting that you lied to authorities about getting kidnapped?
Answer the question.
I did.
[Spectators murmur]
- So, you're a pathological liar?
- No.
Really? Because even a sociopath couldn't lie
- that well on the stand.
- Seriously.
I lied about seeing Wes, not about being kidnapped.
You signed an affidavit admitting you made the whole thing up.
Because my father made me.
- I'm so confused.
- It's simple.
I was really kidnapped.
I just had to say I wasn't in order to protect my father.
Right.
The defense requested this hearing with the intention of proving malicious prosecution.
The only thing they've been able to prove is to what extraordinary...
And illegal... lengths they're willing to go to have these charges dropped.
Now, although the cremation of the victim's body was an egregious clerical error, the official autopsy results prove that the fire was the cause of death...
A fire started by Ms.
Keating in her own home.
And the only person to refute the findings was one of her own students who we now know has a history of perjury.
And let's not forget the evidence against Ms. Keating, that Mr. Gibbins was about to take an immunity deal incriminating her.
Ms. Keating instructed Mr.
Gibbins to go to her house hours before he was killed.
Then she erased her cellphone?
We even have an anonymous source who's willing to testify as to her motives.
Whose identity is still being hidden from us.
We will reveal the identity as we get closer to the trial.
Either way, this case deserves to go before a jury.
At the very least, we owe that to Mr. Gibbins.
Jacobs: There's no need to delay my decision.
Your Honor, I urge you to take more time with the facts of this hearing.
More time won't change my decision.
While it's true that
A.D.A. Atwood engaged in heinous misconduct, it doesn't cancel out the abundance of evidence against Ms. Keating.
Defense's motion to dismiss is denied.
[Gavel bangs]
[Spectators murmur]
Well, that was a big waste of time.
You think?
[Handcuffs click]
I'm sorry.
[Knock on door]
Not now, Janice.
[Door opens]
It's not Janice.
Why are you here, Mr. Walsh?
I want Wes' immunity deal.
- Connor? [Sighs]
- He's probably just dropping a mean one in the bathroom.
Or he just finally went to Russia.
Okay, you do not still get to be mad at him.
Oh, I get to be mad at him for the rest of my life.
- He's not in there.
- [Sighs]
Please don't do this. Please.
Please. Please. [Sighs]
- Hey.
- Connor?
- Where the hell is he?
- Where the hell are you?
Denver's office.
What?
I'll file for bifurcation from
Frank first thing tomorrow.
Wait for me in your car.
Tell him he has to get out of there!
God! Are you insane?!
Don't worry. I'm gonna fix this.
How?
By telling the truth...
That Laurel told my story.
No, Connor...
It's the least I can do at this point.
No, it's the dumbest thing you can do at this point.
All he's gonna do is think that you're lying...
O-or worse, that you're a suspect!
Don't worry. I'm getting an immunity deal.
He's having it drafted right now.
So, he's not there?
- No.
- Then leave, please.
We all get it now, that you feel bad, even Laurel.
Say you're not mad at him.
I forgive you, Connor.
So, please, Connor, just come home!
Atwood went to New York for a job interview.
âª We see âª
âª Sister âª
And you believe her?
- âª Mind the flag âª
- I do.
Now I don't know if I believe you.
Excuse me?
After everything I've done to you, said to you...
âª We see âª
âª Sister âª
Still meeting me in cars, helping me...
âª Mind the flag âª
It's hard for me to believe you're not part of all this.
You're being scapegoated, and
I see it with my own eyes.
That's why I'm helping you.
I'm calling the mystery phone number.
You hear that, Connor?
I'm gonna call, and Sylvia or Charles or one of the Mahoneys are gonna pick up, and then we're gonna find out how stupid your plan is.
Michaela: No, yo plan is stupid!
- I'm calling.
- Tell him to hang up.
Like, what is wrong with you?
Seriously, you're gonna get us all arrested!
- Give me the phone!
- Move!
[Cellphone vibrates]
- Put the phone down!
- Hang up the phone, Asher.
[Vibrating continues]
âª We buried the meat âª
âª For mama âª
- [Vibrating continues]
- Annalise: Denver.
He's been gunning for me ever since the Hapstall case, Sinclair.
I strong-armed him into closing the case.
This is such a reach, Annalise.
No.
What's a reach is you prosecuting me...
Annalise: And Atwood would have to do whatever he said.
It's him.
Hello?
Connor?
It's Denver's phone.
It was here in his desk.
- Hang up the phone!
- Tell him to get out of there!
[Door opens]
âª We see âª
âª Sister âª
âª Everything âª
âª Mind the flag âª
[Bone cracks]
Laurel: Annalise?
Annalise, are you here?
Connor: [Echoing] There was gas! I smelled gas.
Whoever killed him cut the gas line.
âª We buried the meat âª
Laurel: [Echoing] I saw someone there...
- They ran out of the storm door.
- [Door slams]
âª Everything âª
âª Mind the flag âª
âª We see âª
âª Sister âª
âª Rotate âª
It's me.
We have a little problem.
Yeah.
But it got kind of messy.
âª Rotate âª
