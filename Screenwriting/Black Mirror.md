# Season 1



## 1. The National Anthem



Hello.

Just tell me whats happened.

And what is it?

Ill be right down.

Whats happened?

Susannah.

Susannah?

Princess Susannah.

Is she all right?

Dont know.

Dont kill me.

Please dont kill me.

Read the statement.

Yes. All right.

On this screen?

That is correct.

Im Susannah

Duchess of Beaumont.

Popularly known as

Princess Susannah.

I am in a place you... er... cannot find, held by one you will not trace.

Prime Minister Michael Callow...

Prime Minister

Michael Callow my life...

..my life depends on you.

If you do not do precisely as instructed by, um... by 4pm this afternoon,

I will be...

..I will be executed.

Please.

What are you doing? Keep it going.

Prime Minister, at this point,

I think its important to say that we are 100% certain that this is, indeed,

Princess Susannah.

Her car was intercepted shortly after midnight, returning from the wedding of a college friend.

Shed insisted on going.

But you had security on her?

Two PPOs, still unconscious.

Heavy sedative, close range, each with a single puncture wound.

No sign of struggle.

Scrap Third World debt?

Save the fucking libraries?

We are convinced both the video and the demand it contains are genuine.

What demand?

What Susannah says next...

It concerns you directly, sir.

Just play it.

There is only one demand, and it is a simple one.

At 4pm this afternoon,

Prime Minister Michael Callow must appear on live British television on all networks, terrestrial and satellite, and... No!

On all British networks, terrestrial and satellite, and have full unsimulated sexual intercourse with a pig.

I dont understand!

The video ends with a series of technical specifications for the broadcast.

Why are you doing this?

Is this joke, right?

"Mike! Ho ho."

Its real.

She said pig.

Sex with a pig.

They want me to have sex with a pig?

Live on television this afternoon.

But what...? Who...?

Were checking with embedded operatives, compiling a list of suspects.

Meanwhile, the demand has been made.

Theres not long to formulate our response.

Well, Im not fucking a pig!

Page one, thats not happening.

Of course.

Absolutely, sir.

Well, have we established a dialogue with this...?

We cant. Theres no e-mail address, no code word.

No channel for negotiation.

So we focus on finding Susannah.

We get her back.

However its done, I dont care.

We stop this now.

Everyones working towards this.

Yes. No. Not everyone. A dedicated core team. This cant go wide.

Keep it so far from the press its on the other side of Jupiter.

This only exists in this room.

Its already outside it.

If there are hacks sniffing around, shut them down, bright, red, D Notice.

Super fucking Godzilla injunction with ten-inch Whitehall fangs!

This video came from YouTube.

What?

It was uploaded via an encrypted IP an hour ago.

Well, get it off there!

We did after nine minutes, long enough for it to be duplicated and spread.

Spread?

How many people have seen this?

We take down one, six clones pop up elsewhere.

How many people?

50,000. Thats our current estimate.

The news rooms have got it.

Theyre running this on air?

No. We put a type five D notice out and theyre complying.

For now.

Its trending on Twitter.

For... Fucking internet!

What now? Whats the play book?

This is virgin territory,

Prime Minister.

Theres no play book.

Princess Susannahs been kidnapped!

You scared the shit out of me!

Theres a youtube of it!

Go to work!

And satellite,

..And have full unsimulated sexual intercourse with a pig.

No way. Its a piss take, man.

Look at it!

I dont understand!

Why this is on the news?

..Carlton Blooms controversial exhibition closes three weeks ahead of schedule... 

How do we describe it?

"An indecent act"?

Everyones seen the video.

They know the details.

If we mention bestiality

Ofcom would be pissed off.

Fuck Ofcom!

Were observing the D Notice.

Surely were going to do something.

We are honouring the D Notice.

The voluntary D Notice!

It may be a sportsman-like gesture but we are making it.

A womans life is at stake!

We follow the procedure.

My timeline consists of 100% viewers asking why were not covering it.

How do I reply?

You dont.

That is totally backwards.

No-one else has broken rank.

Not the Beeb, not Sky, not...

Facebooks coverage is pretty comprehensive!

Maybe

Its like 9/11s happening and were broadcasting sandwich recipes.

Were not a chat room!

Its on CNN and Fox.

And MSNBC, Al Jazeera, NHK...

All right.

God! This planet!

OK, Sarah, cover the snatch itself.

Damon, public reaction. Meera, the royal angle, upcoming marriage, etc.

Simon, set tone with

Standards and Practices.

We need to explain this without viewers sicking up their Weetabix.

Ken, the internet aspect, new paradigm,

Twitter, Arab spring, all that.

Dan, all graphics run past me.

Keep it functional... no Peppa Pigs.

Malaika, update the princess obit VT.

The Obit VT?

Mm-hm. First, an awkward phone call.

Least I can do is warn Tom.

We put a D Notice on it.

Its gone global, Tom.

Dont. Im begging you.

Dont run it, Martin.

Look, Im sorry. I cant help you.

You know how much help youre getting hereon in?

Multiply nothing by shit-all!

UKN are dead for us!

Shove it up your arse you fucking...

Interesting.

A man.

Man?

A man!

Tom, so youre across it...

Im exploring contingency plans.

I briefed Callett.

Mr Callett.

Noel, from Blue Eye.

Noel won an Emmy by his effects work on that HBO moon Western thing.

Sea Of Tranquillity.

You wont find better.

Can you map a head onto a body live?

Depends if your cameras moving.

Rule sheet specifies a single hand-held camera in a constant roving motion.

Mm.

Yeah, Gonzo style.

He knows his shit. Thats tough.

"Fruition to be transmitted in full"?

Focus on the visuals. Different face mapped onto a live performer.

According to those stipulations.

Fringes of possibility...

Deadlines at four. We need to know if its workable by two.

Cant happen.

It has to.

Our embeds have ruled out the major players. Its not AQ, not IRA.

This is whats left... radicals, hate groups.

People whove threatened yourself or the royals.

Theyre being pulled in as we speak.

For more than questioning, I hope.

Somebody know something.

If we all do it more, therell be less waste lying around... 

Is it still not on the telly?

Nothing. Must be a hoax.

Or a black-out. Heads up!

Some major breaking news here on UKN.

In the last two minutes

Its been confirmed that Susannah, Duchess of Beaumont has been kidnapped.

A video uploaded anonymously to the Internet appears to depict the princess pleading for her life.

The video also contains a bizarre ransom demand of a personal nature involving the Prime Minister, and a detailed list of instructions relating to the enactment of this demand.

As police round up potential suspects... 

... across the nation.

..This viewer video shows officers raiding an address in Bradford.

A man thought to be connected with a religious pressure group, dragged to a waiting van... 

If its terrorists, theyll take her head off.

For fucks sake, man!

Just saying.

Theyll be asking for a million quid or something.

They want him to do it with a pig.

Demands...

Telegraph has the whole video and an interactive timeline. Tonally stark.

Brief mention of the ransom being

"a sex act". Nothing too gross.

Sun runs with "Taken".

Big grab of Susannah...

Of course I still want that drink.

Then give me something.

Its not...

That wont be possible.

Im friendly when I drink.

Very friendly when Im grateful.

Theres no comment at this time

The Guardian are running a fucking live blog and a short piece on the historical symbolism of the pig.

..Only five hours away,

UKNs Damon Brown analyses the public reaction to the crisis.

Its a day like no other.

The kidnap video has been watched by over 18 million people.

Social networking sites are a... buzz with 10,000 Tweets per minute.

While we wait for

Downing Street to respond, the nation is voicing its opinion.

I dont think anyone should concede to any humiliation under threat.

I couldnt bear to watch that.

I wont be tuning in.

Just thinking about it is horrible.

Thats disgusting.

It is disgusting.

It is disgusting but... after that, hes gonna be hero.

People will look at him like hes insane and take his position away.

It will be hilarious to see that on TV.

Nothing too abnormal for MPs.

Theyre all sexual deviants, all MPs and Prime Ministers.

Weve been squeezing hard, but nothing concrete.

Its my house! You cant...

You are in my doorway touching my door handle!

Could I have a word?

It wont come to that.

And if they dont find her?

MI5 have got a name.

Theyre surrounding the place now.

Where?

What?

Wheres the place?

Truro.

- Why are you lying?

- What?

Youre lying!

Truro? Jesus!

I dont want you worrying.

Youve never patronised me.

Dont start now.

Whoever this is, is insane.

And has a princess.

Well get through this.

Not any princess... the princess.

Princess bloody Facebook bloody eco-conscious national sweetheart.

I wont have to do anything.

Everyones laughing at us.

You dont know that.

I know people.

We love humiliation.

I can not laugh

Nothing is going to happen.

Its already happening in their heads.

In their heads, thats what youre doing, what my husband is doing.

Please!

Jane.

I love you.

What?

Palace on the phone, sir.

Get Alex to stall them.

Shes already been speaking to her for ten minutes.

"Her"?

Its the Queen herself.

Go on.

As the 4pm deadline draws nearer, the world holds its breath...  waiting to discover where the princess

Would they use a female pig?

Its on the list.

List of rules, specifies camera angles and things.

Like dogme 95.

Its not like Dogme 95.

Exactly that.

Whats Dogme 95?

Cinematic movement.

Lars von Trier.

Rules for a director... no background music, only natural light, for authenticity.

Same as these, so they cant cheat, cut another guys arse pumping away.

I cant think of anything remotely like this.

A new form of terrorism...

Its not Islamist. To request a pig is specifically abhorrent.

Thats the point!

Make love to a pig!

Make love?

Steer them away from the grisly details.

Lets not dwell on any of the details.

This is already a huge national talking point.

Isnt this precisely what whoever is behind this is looking for?

Hows Her Majesty taking it?

"I trust youll do everything in your power to get her back."

And we are.

It wasnt a collective "you".

It was a singular "you", ie me.

Sir, we may have something. Jamies been tracing the videos origin.

I thought it was untraceable.

Technically, yes, so I thought,

"Work with what we do now"

That video, before Youtube compression it was 57.3 meg.

Algorithm.

Anyway, we also know it was uploaded at 3:16 AM.

I ran a nationwide traceback on uninterrupted one-way uploads of precisely 57.3 meg in the minutes leading up to 3:16, and the closest I can get is a postcode.

It came from somewhere in there.

Looks like a campus.

Yeah. Closed 2010.

Its been empty since.

Latest I-sat image on this area?

3 AM flyover shot from last night...

Looks like it had lights on.

We got him. We got him.

Alert the local team.

Full squad. Ill man it.

With helmet-cam relay.

We can watch the operation.

Press office, OK, Tom?

Yes!

Right. Confident?

Its a kick-bollock scramble, but with finessing it should be OK.

Finesse quickly.

Our performers on his way.

Its a new one for me, obviously.

I wouldnt normally... You know.

You seen any of my films?

No.

Im pretty trad... bish, bash, bosh.

In, out.

Yeah, well...

What do I put on the invoice?

Thats what Im wondering.

There wont be any invoicing.

- Oi-oi, Rod!

- Oi-oi!

Need to prep two statements

Good outcome. Bad outcome.

Rescue operation?

Goon squads heading for postcode in Buckinghamshire.

HP84TD, a college or something.

They should be there by now.

Yeah, Ive reduced the luminance...

Agent Callett, this is Mr Flynn.

AKA, Rod Senseless.

Stage name.

Yeah. Well...

You need to get into this.

Is there a dressing room I can use?

No.

Wheres my co-star?

Be rude not to give her a kiss beforehand.

Outside in the truck.

Full of joie de vivre, isnt he?

You also need to wear this... on your head.

Boards been prised away.

Thats where they got in.

OK.

Target identified.

Commissioner. Thank you.

So, team red...

Any orders, boss?

Continue reconnaissance and await instructions, before you proceed.

With the 4pm deadline three hours away, time is running out for the Prime Minister... 

They got in, yeah?

Do you think Id be here if they had?

Weve got statements for either outcome.

Listen, coverage is very sympathetic.

Cant think about coverage now!

But its on-side?

Strong undercurrent of sympathy.

Every poll indicates understanding, disgust with the captor, outrage at the whole thing, but not at you.

If Walkers team fuck up, Im not saying they will, but if they do, the public anticipates non-compliance.

Therell be squawks from the usuals, but its not "England expects".

If he kills her, theres no blood on your hands. Bottom line.

With hours to go, time is running out for the security services.

Joining us is actress Lydia... 

Thought this was coming from IB7.

We trimmed the edges so its coming direct.

Twinkle tits from?

Actress, Downton Abbey, knows the princess.

This came for you, left at reception.

Courier dropped it off.

Know how to plug this in?

Jack, call the police. Take it!

Get someone to shoot that first.

What the fuck is this?

I gave you rules.

I said no cheating.

Some more breaking news, and a severed finger, thought to belong to Princess Susannah, has been delivered to UKN, along with a video apparently showing the kidnapper removing it from the princess.

UKN News has passed all material to Scotland Yard... 

Fucking hell!

God! I cant watch this!

Hes got to do what they want.

Yes, he fucking has!

..Which contained a statement accusing Downing Street of attempting to break the rules

This grim development comes just hours before the 4PM deadline... 

Jesus!

Unless Im mistaken, our mystery man specified no visual trickery in his original demand, didnt he?

I considered it necessary...

Considered it necessary.

To divise...

FUCKING HELL!

- Mike...!

- Dont!

Its nor...

One word, I swear I will fucking...!

What did you do, Alex?

I had a back-up plan.

A man prepared to do it and an FX company that would paint your head onto his shoulders.

You actually thought that would work?

I believed it worth considering.

Then youre a stupid bitch.

With your interest at heart.

Who knew about this?

A select few.

It seems some idiot at the studio recognised our designated performer,

Tweeted a photo and the online hivemind did the maths.

Its not playing well.

With who?

With, er... anyone.

A few hours ago, public opinion was behind Prime Minister Callow, with only 28% of the public believing he should fulfil the bizarre and illegal request.

In the wake of these images, and the delivery of the princesss finger, the mood is shifting.

Itll be humiliating, but nothing compared to her suffering.

With the appearance of finger...

Hes just got to do it.

Yes, he has to do it.

Whats the alternative?

We can get another Prime Minister.

We cant live without a princess.

Of course...

If he doesnt get her released, hes finished, isnt he?

Online polls suggest that 86% of voters now believe the demand should be met.

Damon Brown... 

When are Walkers team hitting the college?

They need time...

No more pissing around.

Julians advising against...

Im advising for.

They go in now. They go in now.

Wheres my obit VT?

What would you say if I said I was near where Susannahs being held?

Id say bullshit.

Then youd be wrong.

Have you got a crew with you?

Im not stupid.

Malaika?

Hello?

Are you getting this?

Yeah. Dont put yourself in any danger.

Still getting this?

Yeah. Just stay safe, Malaika.

Be careful!

If this doesnt work... we need...

Armed police! Lay down on the floor!

Lay down on the floor!

Move!

Fuck!

Its a decoy.

They must have bounced the upload from here with a proxy. Im sorry.

Jesus!

Theyre looking right at her!

They cant see her.

Malaika, make sure they cant... 

Stay down! Dont move!

Run, Malaika! Run!

Get out of there. Come on!

Armed police!

Is it him?

Where the fuck is Jack?

Advance! Advance! Advance!

Get down!

Get down!

UKN. Its Malaika something or other. Shes from UKN.

You press? Yes.

There goes your RTS Award.

There must be something.

Theres nothing there, Mike.

Therell be a clue.

Some evidence.

Weve done all we can.

You rescued mannequin.

Im sorry, Michael...

Fuck off, Julian!

20 past three. Were out of time.

Were not out of time!

Were not out of time.

Its not going to happen.

To the public...

Fuck the public!

To the public, this would be one man of questionable popularity putting personal embarrassment over the life of a girl.

They will not release her anyway.

Shes probably already dead.

If she isnt, hell kill her and upload the video.

Everyone will see it.

The world will see it.

The mood will border on insurrection and you will be destroyed,

I guarantee you... utterly destroyed.

The polling bears that out.

You wont just be a disgraced politician,

The public, the Palace and the Party insist on compliance.

Fuck the Party!

Refuse, and Ive been advised that we cannot guarantee your physical safety.

Or that of your family.

But...

Ive made arrangements for the broadcast.

I cant...

Im sorry, Michael.

Its out of your hands.

Lets take you live to the scene in central London.

As we see the Prime Ministers car travelling across London... 

Hes got to do it.

The worlds bloody broken.

..Appears to be heading west to Bankside Studios.

Weve ratified the law... after midnight, itll be a criminal of fence to store any recording or images of the event.

Theyre doing an announcement to warn people off even watching, some sonic tone that causes nausea.

..When public opinion has very much hardened, following the delivery of the princesss severed finger.

As the 4pm deadline approaches, the nation is at a stand still watching the extraordinary situation play out.

Just to remind you, this is now a story of global significance... 

"Michael Callow has displayed incredible bravery"

"in what was a matter of life or death."

Thats how it opens, then we should move on...

OK. Yeah.

Everything prepared?

Yes, maam.

Its sedated?

Injection. Its docile.

Its time to go in now.

..An unprecedented nature.

This is an official announcement.

In a few minutes, the Prime Minister will perform an indecent act on your screens.

..In the hope that it will ensure the release of Princess Susannah.

Recording or possessing a copy of this broadcast will become illegal at midnight.

All viewers are advised to turn off their televisions immediately.

The broadcast will commence after the following tone.

Were complying with the stipulated rules.

Youll have to keep going...

Youll have to see it through to the end.

Weve placed visual aids in your eyeline, which might help if you... get into trouble.

The suggestion were getting from psychologists is that you should take as long as you need.

If you rush, it might be misinterpreted as eagerness or even enjoyment.

Its just a skeleton crew inside.

Closed set.

There he is!

I trust this will bring about the safe return of Princess Susannah.

I...

I love my wife.

May God forgive me.

No!

Jesus! Poor bastard!

But its been on for nearly an hour.

Its history, this.

Weve got her. Susannah.

They released her?

Stumbling about in the city.

Sedated. She cant remember anything, but shes unharmed.

But her finger?

Not hers. DNA shows its male.

What?

There is one other thing. Theres a

CCTV grab of her from half three.

It seems he let her go

30 minutes before it happened.

Why?

My guess... he knew everyone would be elsewhere watching screens.

So its a statement.

Maam?

Thats what this was all about, making a point.

Should we, er...?

Lose that page of the report.

No-one sees it, especially the PM.

Of course.

Good news, Michael.

You saved her.

Susannahs alive and well.

On the one-year anniversary of his humiliating ordeal, an apparently unconcerned Michael

Callow put in an assured performance at a public appearance, accompanied by his wife Jane.

Here I go.

OK.

The other central figure in events was also before the camera at last nights

Children Of Valour Awards.

Princess Susannah made her first public appearance since announcing her pregnancy.

It was one year ago that the Turner Prize-winning artist,

Carlton Bloom, coerced the Prime Minister into committing an indecent act.

As the anniversary arrived, one art critic caused controversy by describing it as "the first great artwork of the 21st century".

While cultural commentators debate its significance, with a global audience of 1.3 billion, it was an event in which we all participated.

However, the incident failed to destroy a Prime Minister, who holds an approval rating three points higher than last year.

Damon Brown, UKN.

Jane.

Jane, please.

Best thing about my new lifestyle?

Nice outfit

Suits you.

Well, honesty is ruthless so I suppose its just honesty... ruthless honesty.

Drying my hands.

Bing Manson.

Short for Bingham.

Abi Carner.

Short for Abi Carner.

Youre a new person.

Ive not seen you.

I just went 21 last week.

I wanted to go to Airdale

My sisters there, but...

Its full, apparently.

Proper fruit.

It was worth the risk.

The most natural thing in theres probably grown in a Petri dish.

Yeah.

Quite good, though.

Yeah. Thats the right way round.

When you get the cheap one, you end up having to pedal it off.

Then you want more sugar. Then youre playing catch-up and Ive...

Ive been there.

Its a vicious circle.

Cant you just use that CPT app?

Whats that?

This cognitive behavioural thing.

It realigns your thinking to pick healthy food.

Whispers you into it while you sleep.

Yeah, I should try that, yeah.

I liked your singing the other day.

I was trying to sing so no-one could hear me pee.

Im not Selma or anything.

Youve got a phenomenal voice.

It was the most beautiful song...

Y... You think Im being cheesy?

All right, I am being cheesy.

But it was beautiful, so, you know...

Realitys cheesy sometimes.

Not often, admittedly, but...

Now.

Yeah...

Well, thank you.

Its just noises, though.

Noises in the right order.

Dont downplay... youre good.

The songs good. Its old.

My mum used to sing it and she learnt it from her mum.

A hand-me-down.

You thought of trying out for Hot Shot?

Me?

Why not?

Singing in front of Judge Hope?

Id die! Seriously, Id be halfway to the afterlife come the chorus.

No, youd walk it.

(A) I wouldnt.

(And B)... I dont have that clockage.

Its, what, 12 mil just to enter?

What kind of bike time is that?

Six months?

- Yeah, but...

- Im hand to mouth.

I know people save and stuff to get onto that stage and then theres what Selma did.

But, you know what?

- Id rather not give myself...

- Yeah, but Ill gift it to you.

The full 12, Ill gift it.

Dont be ridiculous!

Seriously, Ive got it spare.

Youve got 12 mil spare?

My brother left it me.

Own a channel, does he?

No, he...

He died.

He... He died last year, so it got transferred to me.

Just over six months worth, but Ive kept it.

Why dont you spend it on you, then?

And buy what? Some new shoes for my doppel to wear?

I dont know, upgrade your MOS...

Or get a Fat Attack season pass?

Buy one of those wall buddies.

The new ones that talk to you after shutting and solve your problems.

They guide your dreams, like gurus.

Its amazing, really, what they can do.

A mirror plug-in? That shows me how I look as a werewolf? Whats the point?

- I know it can be quite funny.

- Its all just stuff. Its...

Its stuff, its confetti, its...

Youve got something real.

What better to spend it on?

You heard me singing in a toilet.

Is that real?

More than anything thats happened all year.

I cant take that kind of clockage off someone.

Its 12 mils, no way.

Let me do this.

I... I look around here, I just...

I just want something real to happen.

Just once.

Id mess up.

You wouldnt. I dont care anyway.

Ill go with you.

Ill be able to force you.

Ill force you to go.

Its tomorrow.

Come on!

Say yes.

Ill go as far as to say, "OK."

Which proves acceptable.

Thank God for that.

Walking away now.

You loon!

I can live with it!

Id love to fucking ruin that and all.

What?

15?

A flippin joke...

New from Wraith Babes.

The hottest girls in the nastiest situations.

Yeah!

Cant believe Im doing this.

I am doing this.

I cant be doing this.

Can you trade it back?

The ticket?

Dont be mad.

Its a lot of pressure to put someone under, you know.

Dont think Im not grateful.

But its, its just...

Youre babbling.

Im babbling.

I made you this.

You never get to keep them more than a day, but there it is, anyway.

It folds flat.

So you can keep them in your waistband.

Thank you.

Its, you know... something.

Face the screen, please.

Is he your Friends And Family allocation?

Hand, please.

Thats not permanent, is it?

No. Two months max.

Round to the right, and through the scanner.

Where do we go now?

You wait here.

How long?

So, what do we do?

I dont know.

Hey, hey, hey.

Fuck off.

Her with the dark hair?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. The pretty one.

Yup. OK. Move.

They want to preview you.

- What?

- Preview. Come on.

- Hes with me.

- Hand?

Show me your hand.

OK. You, too.

Thats not fair.

Shes new. Thats not fair.

I dont pick the order.

Ive waited here all week, and shes just walked in.

Everyone will get seen eventually.

I dont pick the order.

But Im a good singer.

I can sing. Im a good singer, I am.

- Stand aside.

- Its not fair!

Its not fair!

- Next lot.

- Stand there.

Would you like to be as big as Salma one day?

Yeah, I mean...

Could you say that as a self-contained sentence into that screen?

I guess Id like to be as big as Salma one day.

OK. Proceed to stage area.

Are we done?

- Both performing?

- Just her.

- Okay... and what are you?

- Singer.

- Cuppliance?

- No, thanks.

A-ha. Yes, thanks!

Its compulsory for all contestants.

More to the point, itll stop you puking with nerves.

- Shes got to perform.

- Well...

Look, just sip it, youll be fine.

Just a touch of light foam.

Itll pass.

Make the most of it.

You cant get this stuff anywhere else.

You OK?

Yeah.

You OK?

Yeah. Just...

I dont know. Things are just wider apart. Im fine.

- Really?

- Yeah, Im fine.

Right. Youre on.

A little closer, please.

Little closer.

Into the light, love.

- And whore we looking at here?

- Abi Khan.

What are you going to do for us today, Abi?

Im going to sing.

You speak up, love.

We dont bite.

Im going to sing.

Hey, would you mind lifting up your top for me?

Can you take off your top?

I want to check out those titties.

Come on. Mucho feranto.

No titties?

She says shes here to sing.

I got to see those titties, though.

Come on, girl.

I mean, damn!

You hot.

Please, just sing for us.

OK. Im going to stop you there.

That was... without a doubt... probably the best piece of singing weve had this season.

Yes! Well done!

Fair play.

But I have to say...

No. No, no, no.

I have to say, actually,

Im with Rafe on this one.

Good though your voice is... and it is good.

Its not the most magical sound in the world.

Its just... good.

I dont think anyones really hearing it.

Certainly not the guys in the audience.

These looks you got going on kind of get in the way.

Men will want you.

Women will hate you.

All the time youre on stage.

Couldnt help picturing you.

In an erotic scenario.

Getting pretty turned on, if Im honest.

Right.

Youve got this pure beauty

What seems to be a knockout figure.

And this sort of interesting innocence going on.

Thats something I think

Rafes erotica channels could really play with.

Absolutely. Thats what I thought the moment I saw you.

The moment.

Id watch. I dont know a man here who wouldnt.

To be honest, some of us girls might join you.

Get off me!

Dont! Abi!

No! Abi! Abi!

I dont think thats quite...

You will never have to pedal again.

Not one minute.

We could really work with you.

Last year we had singers, singers, singers.

So many singers.

So, to be a singer you have to be truly exceptional

Theres just no slots left for an above average singer.

Not for the next few years, at least. Charity?

No. Saturation point, singer-wise.

Listen. We said, right from the start.

Well go with something different this season.

Thats why hes on the panel!

She would be a star on our stream.

A star.

On his...

Youre furniture, at best.

Forget about all the shame, and all that ppht-ppht-tew.

We medicate against that.

You will have pleasure forever.

Realistically, sweetheart, it is that, or the bike.

I, I dont think...

This is starting to annoy me.

Who do you think is powering that spotlight?

Millions of people. Thats who.

All of them, out there, right now.

Putting in an honest day on the bike, while you stand in the light theyre generating and dither.

You know what?

They would give anything.

Do anything to be where you are now.

Am I right?!

You want to cock a snook at all that, as though its nothing.

As though theyre nothing.

And that makes me sick.

But, you know what?

Maybe you do belong on the bike.

Because you dont seem to be very willing to step off it.

I do want to.

We have a decision?

Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

I suppose.

Go on!

Well done!

Best thing about my new lifestyle...

I get to meet lots of hot guys.

Wraith treats me well.

For Christs sake!

I pay for this!

I... pay... for... this!

I pump my arse off, and you...

Fuck you!

Yeah, keep waddling, pig tits.

Find your horizon and fuck off over it!

Its a dream.

I get to live... in a... beautiful place.

And... wear lots of... beautiful things.

Its a dream.

Insufficient funds.

From Wraith Babes... 

Cmon, girl... 

..a Wraith Babes reality special.

I guess Id like to be as big as

Thelma one day.

Millions watched her glide through the Hot Shot curtain of dreams to sing her heart out.

What happened next shocked them all.

We could really work with you.

Do we have a decision?

Now, watch her stunning erotic debut... 

No, no, no, no, no...

So, who do we have here?

Im Abby.

You were at Hot Shot.

You were real impressive.

Resume viewing!

- No! No!

- Resume viewing!

Resume viewing!

Resume viewing!

Resume viewing!

Resume viewing! Resume viewing!

Resume viewing!

Resume viewing!

Look at you.

All clean and shiny.

Portal disabled during commercial.

Youll see everything.

Youll see it all!

Open your mouth.

Open... take it in... take it in... yeah...

No! No! No! No!

The hottest girls... 

Could you stand aside, please?

Come up into the back, in front of me, please.

Are you messin?

A what-nic one?

An eth-nic one!

On it.

Were going to preview, all right?

Want to follow me in the back?

Youre a prick!

Next, lot.

Stand there!

So what are you, a magician?

An entertainer.

Could you say that down the screen as a self-contained sentence?

Im an entertainer.

Before you go on, you need to drink a Cuppliance.

They give me one back there.

Really? OK.

Well, in that case, you are good to... go.

Who are you?

Bing Madsen.

What are you planning to do for us?

What the fuck?!

A sort of performance.

A sort of performance?

Yes.

Man of mystery!

I suppose wed better see it.

OK.

Knobead!

Fucking cock!

Stop or Ill do it. This is a main artery. Keep walking, you kill me.

No-one stops me till Ive said my piece.

Then you can do what you like.

Man, just fucking kill yourself.

Get heavy on me, I swear to God,

I kick your ass back to life, just so I could cut your goddamn head off.

Go on!

I think we should let him speak.

- Speak!

- Speak! Speak! Speak! Speak!

Lets hear what he has to say.

Well?

Come on.

Got our attention, as requested.

What do you want to say?

Have you prepared a speech, is that it?

Speak!

I havent got a speech. I didnt plan words. I didnt even try to...

I just knew I had to get here, to stand here, and I wanted you to listen.

To really listen, not just pull a face like youre listening, like you do the rest of the time.

A face that youre feeling instead of processing.

You pull a face, and poke it towards the stage, and we lah-di-dah, we sing and dance and tumble around.

And all you see up here, its not people, you dont see people up here, its all fodder.

And the faker the fodder, the more you love it, because fake fodders the only thing that works any more.

Its all that we can stomach.

Actually, not quite all.

Real pain, real viciousness, that, we can take.

Yeah, stick a fat man up a pole.

We laugh ourselves feral, because weve earned the right, weve done cell time and hes slacking, the scum, so ha-ha-ha at him!

Because were so out of our minds with desperation, we dont know any better.

All we know is fake fodder and buying shit.

Thats how we speak to each other, how we express ourselves, is buying shit.

What, I have a dream?

The peak of our dreams is a new app for our Dopple, it doesnt exist!

Its not even there!

We buy shit thats not even there.

Show us something real and free and beautiful. You couldnt.

Yeah? Itd break us.

Were too numb for it.

I might as well choke.

Its only so much wonder we can bear.

When you find any wonder whatsoever, you dole it out in meagre portions.

Only then until its augmented, packaged, and pumped through 10,000 preassigned filters till its nothing more than a meaningless series of lights, while we ride day in day out, going where?

Powering what?

All tiny cells and tiny screens and bigger cells and bigger screens and fuck you!

Fuck you, thats what it boils down to.

Fuck you for sitting there and slowly making things worse.

Fuck you and your spotlight and your sanctimonious faces.

Fuck you all for thinking the one thing

I came close to never meant anything.

For oozing around it and crushing it into a bone, into a joke.

One more ugly joke in a kingdom of millions.

Fuck you for happening.

Fuck you for me, for us, for everyone.

Fuck you!

That was, without a doubt, the most heartfelt thing

Ive seen on this stage since Hotshot began!

Brilliant!

You... youre so articulating something we all, and I mean everyone in this hall, something we all agree on.

Even though we may not comprehend all of it.

I think Im right in saying we do feel it.

Even me.

I know youve got me down as this creature.

You know, hey...

I get where youre coming from.

- I like your stuff.

- Its not stuff.

Its truth. Am I right?

Your truth, admittedly, but truth nonetheless.

And youre right.

Authenticity is in woefully short supply.

Id like to hear you talk again.

How so?

The slot on one of my streams where you can talk just like that.

Id watch it.

It was such great passion.

Hes aright.

Youre a little hot there, bud.

That throat cutting thing?

Neat gimmick.

What do you say?

30 minutes twice a week?

- Do it, do it, do it!

- Do it, do it, do it!

Do it, do it, do it!

Do it, do it, do it!

Do it, do it, do it!

Do it, do it, do it!

Go on, you bastard.

- Do it, do it, do it!

- Do it, do it, do it!

Beats the bike.

Certainly does.

We have with us Oliver.

Oliver ate and ate till he hit 17 stone and hes here today to try and beat us on Botherguts!

Keep going.

OK, Im going to stop you there.

That was achingly terrible.

You have the magnetism of a towel. I dont ever want to look at you again.

I have to agree.

Im so sorry, love.

You came across as fundamentally unlikeable and really quite worthless.

You could fill that pussy with honey and I still wouldnt fuck it.

Im a good singer. I can sing, yeah.

Cos this is my destiny and I can sing, fu...!

Like that, dont you, Harry?

Say it.

Yeah.

15,000 new wardrobe options launched last week alone.

It effectively translates as

15,000 new ways to kill time in your cell before you explore an afterlife which doesnt exist anyway.

With any luck, itll take your mind off those saddle sores?

You know the only thing stopping me from slashing myself open right now?

I might not die right away.

And before I went, theyd find a way to charge my twitching half-dead cadaver,

20,000 merits for swabbing the walls clean.

- Yeah.

- Anyway, hang on in there if you must.

Were all in this together they say.

Yeah, right.

Farewell for ever.

Till the same time next week.

Stream off-line.





## 3. The entire history of you



♪ ♪

(man) Liam Foxwell, welcome.

Thank you.

Okay, little speech time.

I've been mentioning this to everyone about their appraisals, and I just want you to know that this isn't a witch hunt for the deadwood okay.

It's much more of a... treasure hunt for the gold.

Shit sinks, but also cream floats.

Yes, yes I see that.

(man) A new area we're getting lots of play in, and your office could be at the centre for, is litigation in retrospective parenting cases.

Retrospective?

Bobby sues Mum and Dad for insufficient attention, leading to lack of confidence, leading to damages against earnings.

Right, and we're okay the firm's okay ... with that ethically and morally?

Yep.

Huh-huh.

Sure.

Yeah, yeah right.

Are you?

Totally, yeah.

Yes.

Okay, Liam, look...

So if we invite you to stay with the firm in the new environment, what we'd have you to is pull an exhaustive re-do with personnel maybe next week?

Oh, well, I, I was ready to do a big re-do right now, but...

No, no, no, it's fine, next week's fine.

But I have to ask you this, they aren't gonna hit anything to freak us out are they?

They're not, there's no major deletions this quarter?

No, no, everything's well within parameters.

Great, okay, Liam this has been really great.

Look really hope to look forward to seeing you again.

Okay, thank you.

Airport please.

(beeping)

(woman)

Live, breathe, smell.

Full spectrum memory.

You could get a Willow Grain upgrade for less than the price of a daily cup of coffee, and three decades of backup for free.

Install ingrained procedure with local anaesthetic and you're good to go, because memory is for living.

(rewinding)

Okay, great, this has been really great Liam we, we really hope to look forward to seeing you again.

(rewinding)

Liam, we, we really hope to look forward to seeing you again.

Sorry!

(beep)

Mr. Foxwell?

Could you just rewind me your last 24 hours, quad speed that for me, please.

Great, and back that up for me times 64 for the week.

(beeping)

That's great.

Enjoy your flight Mr. Foxwell.

I'm not being funny, right, but look at that.

Look at what?

That frayed carpet.

There, you see?

Seriously?

Yes, seriously.

This is a five-star suite.

I've paid good money to have perfect details.

Now, I've got that shitty carpet for the rest of my life.

Only if you keep looking at it, mate.

Oh, thanks, Jonas!

Now fuck off!

Alright now, now you thought the carpet was bad, have a look at this.

But you've met Lucy my wife at the Dublin wedding?

Oh, that's right, yeah, hi, Liam.

Hi, hi again.

Yeah.

Hello.

Lucy, Liam, we met at the Dublin wedding.

Liam!

Yeah.

Oh, great.

Liam, yes, come in.

Thank you.

Oh, great to see you again.

Yeah, you too.

Thanks, where's Fi been hiding you?

Oh, you know, in our house.

(laughs)

We didn't know, she didn't know if you were gonna make it.

Well, it was over quicker than I thought, so...

Whoop.

Ooops, sorry, hello.

Let's get you a drink. Beer okay?

Lovely, thank you.

Everyone's through there actually, so I'll be in in a minute okay?

Okay, thank you.

Hi.

You're back early then I,

I didn't think you'd make it.

Yeah, well, I didn't stay over and I caught an early flight back, so...

- Hiya.

- Hello.

So how was the appraisal?

Well, they said they'd let me do a re-do sometime next week, so...

Oh, but good?

Well...

- Later?

- Later.

Okay.

How's Jody?

At home, Gina's babysitting.

Oh, Gina?

Hey.

Jonas, this is, this is...

Liam right?

Yeah.

Jonas. Dude, really nice to meet ya, how you doing? You alright?

- Good, good thank you.

- Wicked.

And you know Jeff?

Yes.

Yeah, you'd remember meeting

Jeff, 'cause he would have shown you, I don't know, a re-do of the side of this fridge, something like that.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Piss off Jonas!

Hello.

Hello. Your wife's being very mean to me tonight.

Ah, well, she's like that.

Yeah, tell me about it.

Oh, you alright for a drink?

I'm fine, thank you, Jonas.

- Nice one.

- Yeah, cheers.

Colleen, come and meet Liam, he's...

Soon to be unemployed slash unemployable lawyer.

Hi.

And Jeff. Jeff and Fi used to run the parties down the Fraser Road with Paul and me.

Mad old days!

Before we started up the Kings.

So...

Yeah.

So, Liam, what, what, what was it you had?

Assessment?

Appraisal.

How'd it go?

Good.

Well, it was, it was a disaster but, you know, I, I don't know.

- Hard to gauge?

- Yeah.

Well let's have a look, re-do, we can appraise the appraisal.

(laughs)

Yeah, right.

Throw it up there and we can grade you.

- Er...

- Yeah, come on.

Well, it could be fun, we could... vote!

- Paul?

- Yeah?

(Jeff) And I work in recruitment actually so it might be quite useful for you, going forward.

Right, okay.

Liam's gonna re-do his appraisal so we can give him marks.

Notes.

Well, no pointers, you know.

I think Liam would probably...

Yeah, do you know what, guys...

Hey, guys. Now come on seriously, that's not cool.

I mean Liam's obviously uncomfortable so let's just...

...drop it, yeah?

Have a cool time.

(Paul) Time to eat!

(Lucy) Oh, it's ready.

Thank you so much for inviting us this evening, it's been too long.

Yes, it has.

Too long.

Fi?

I haven't met him before have I?

Jonas is it?

He's one of the old crowd.

I think I said.

Oh.

- You okay?

- Yeah, yeah.

You know if you're not in the mood we can go.

No, no, I'm fine.

Sure?

Hey.

(Jonas) Oh, no, I bought enough for others to share.

Thank you.

I've been cooking a lot since the break-up.

Jonas has had a tough one.

(door bell)

(Colleen) Was it bad?

Yeah, yeah.

We were in the middle of planning it all and I suddenly realised that the less the relationship means the more you spend on the wedding, you know.

You actually start obsessing over, over the tiniest little details, like, like the thickness of the wedding invitation paper, 'cause I mean

God knows you need something to fucking talk about!

So everybody, this is Hallam, Hallam, Jonas.

- Hi.

- Hi.

And everyone!

- Hi.

- Hello.

(Lucy) Help yourself.

Jonas was just explaining why relationships are a sham.

Are they? Shit!

They're like going to the theatre.

You pay loads to go and ultimately you're wasting your entire night, so when someone asks you

"Did you have a good time?" you both say "Yeah" you know,

"Yeah, it was great", but the problem is the more that you pay, and the longer it goes on, the more you're "Oh, yeah we really loved it", you know,

"We, we love being together and never fucking anyone else and only having just one other person to share our real thoughts with for our entire lives".

I mean, yeah, it's great.

Would you say you loved her though?

I just think we just really fancied each other, and that was what it was.

You know what it's like early on, you know, we were just, I don't know, we're just two tools in a tool shed that just fit together really fucking well.

I mean still by the end I'd be like "Go on, honey, you go up,

I'm just gonna watch a little bit more of the news", and I'd find myself, you know, watching re-does of like hot times in earlier relationships.

(Lucy) Easy!

I'm just saying, there's a beautiful woman upstairs, you know, waiting to have sex with me...

What, right now?

(laughter)

She's upstairs you know waiting to have sex with me, and I'm sat downstairs watching re-does of like some hot times with some hot girl that

I'd just picked up in some place, and I'm fucking pulling myself off. I mean, seriously.

Ah, come on.

Come on, guys, I mean, we all scroll through the grain rifling through our greatest hits for a little bit of filth now and then, surely?

Not me.

Hallam doesn't have a grain.

(Paul) Oh, wow.

No shit.

Is that a political thing?

No, no, I was gouged about 12 months ago.

Jesus, was that painful?

Total agony.

But on the plus of that, I don't remember it that clearly.

There's a scar in here.

Yeah?

Can I...?

Yeah, it feels quite nice.

And no brain damage clearly.

Well, my sight held on fine.

(Jonas) So who took it then?

(Hallam) Stolen to order, as far as they could tell probably to some millionaire Chinese perv.

- (Jonas) Really?

- Yeah.

Is that for real?

Yeah, and none of it was encrypted, so...

So they saw the lot?

But the thing is after I was gouged I didn't have one for a few days and then just kind of liked it.

(Jonas) It's cool, it's cool,

I mean because more people,

I mean it's a big thing now right?

Like, going grainless?

(Colleen) I believe it's huge with hookers.

I mean, no offence!

No, no, it's okay.

Well, I'm pretty boring.

One man at a time.

Boo!

Serial monogamist.

I'm a serial monogamist.

I'm staying faithful to my cornflakes right now.

(laughter)

Well I think it's an interesting choice, going grainless.

It's a brave choice.

I'm sorry, but...

I couldn't do it.

Uh-huh.

Okay, I was gonna play some re-does from the Fraser Road days.

Yey!

Stuff from the last night, depressing or fun.

(Colleen)

You know half the organic memories you have are junk.

Just not trustworthy.

Colleen works in grain development.

With half the population, you can implant false memories just by asking leading questions in therapy.

You can make people remember getting lost in shopping malls they never visited, getting bothered by paedophile baby sitters they never had.

I'm just happier now.

(rewinding)

Okay, great, Liam, this has been, this has been really great.

We really hope to look forward to seeing you again.

He looks forward to seeing you again, that's good.

Hopes to look forward.

We really hope to look forward to seeing you again.

It's phoney.

Hang on, pause it.

Now back up.

Zoom in there.

Come on, that's a tick.

(Liam) That could be a V or an L.

It's a tick.

Or the start of a swastika.

It's probably the start of a swastika, they were such pricks.

Did you have fun with the old gang?

Yeah.

Speak to that Jonas much?

No, no, not really.

He's a bit of knob innit?

Bit of a dick?

Jonas.

Pulling himself off to his own relationships theories.

Oh, it must be such a drag,

Jonas, putting it about.

And when he protected me from those assholes.

"Hey, come on, guys, it's really not cool to re-do another man's appraisals dudes".

Then why invite him over?

I like him.

You wanted me to invite him.

I didn't say anything.

You were laughing at everything he said!

You invited him!

It's obvious I didn't want him to come.

(click)

(Ffion) Wow, it's early, it's early to call it a night.

(Jonas) Right, do you fancy a quick one down the pub?

(Liam) Oh, I've gotta get back, rescue Jody from the paedophile baby sitter!

Yeah.

But Jonas, why don't you come back to ours for a nightcap if you want?

See.

It was obvious I didn't want him to come, I was being polite.

To a moron.

If you really don't want him to come, you can get rid of him.

Hey, hey.

(Liam) Hey.

Well actually what time is it?

It's midnight.

Phew, shit, it's quite late!

Time's gone on.

- Yeah, time does that.

- Yeah.

What, 15 minutes?

Yeah.

But it, we've got the baby sitter inside, so...

So is that new info?

No, it's just that, we, I mean we thought, right, Fi?

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

Okay, now I get it.

No, it's just that actually it turns out we're tired and I guess we forgot, but now we've remembered, so, sorry.

No, it's fine really.

(Ffion) I'm sorry.

Oh, it's cool, no worries, yeah

I've got a backup plan so...

Oh, cool, well, envoke the back up.

Yeah, I will.

See you later, Fi.

It's good to meet you, man.

Yeah.

Nice one.

Brilliant, brilliant.

Okay, cool.

Good to meet you, man, yeah.

Listen, Gina, it's a 40 minute wait for a cab, but if you want I'll have the bed made up in my office, yeah?

Okay, thanks, Fi.

Hey just, you know, use anything, there's T-shirts and...

Alright, yes, thanks,

I'll show myself up.

- Alright, night.

- Night, guys.

Night, Gina.

(bling)

(baby cries)

Thank you.

Is he a big part of the gang?

- Who?

- Jonas.

I don't know, yeah?

Let me guess, he's spent his time oozing around the girls, offering back rubs.

Not really.

Circling for an orifice.

Was he always that oily or...

Okay, look...

What?

It's nothing, but...

...you may have noticed a bit of an atmosphere because...

...me and Jonas years ago had a bit of a thing.

You had a thing with oily dude man.

It was just a little thing and I didn't even know you back then, so...

You slept with oily dude man?

That's hilarious!

We've all got our skeletons, how about you and Gemma?

Well, I told you about Gemma.

Gemma was a nutcase, but you never mentioned Jonas.

I did, I told you I hooked up with someone in Marrakech.

Jonas is Mr. Marrakech?

It was like a month, it was a stupid thing and then...

I thought Mr. Marrakech was some sort of super cool, well not him.

It was years ago and...

Are you embarrassed by that?

'Cause it's embarrassing.

I'm sorry but, Christ, are you not embarrassed?

It was years ago.

But you dated him for a month?

That's what I said.

'Cause when you told me about

Mr. Marrakech, it was a week.

No, I didn't.

(rewinding)

(Liam) What about you?

I don't wanna see our first time right now.

Ssh, ssh, you're about to talk.

(Ffion) I went away and had a little thing that did my head in for a while with this sort of, this sort of head-fuck guy in Marrakech.

(Liam) Mr. Marrakech?

Yeah!

(Liam) I'm not, I'm imagining it, a chiller, with a big knob.

(Ffion) No, it's like a dormouse.

Big deal, big heartbreaker?

No, it was just a week.

It was a weird week.

So a weird week or a month?

The point it, it wasn't a big deal.

Well, it was big enough to do your head in.

Jonas, King Dormouse Dick of

Marrakech did you head in.

That was a nice night.

Used to be.

You're getting obsessed.

I'm not.

We had all this with Dan,

I don't want you going like that again.

He had little, creepy, beady eyes and he was always...

What, acting like he was interested? And you know what?

I think, I think he probably did fancy me, and actually he wasn't completely hideous, so in another life I don't know, but nothing happened!

And Jonas...

Oh, he's an old fling! So what?

Don't get all fucked up.

Oh, what, I'm fucked up, am I?

No, I mean just...

No, no, that's brilliant, 'cause sometimes you're a bitch.

I didn't mean that.

You're a bitch.

I'd like you to erase that.

You're a bitch.

Also sometimes.

You can't just edit off the word "sometimes".

(door opens, closes)

I'm sorry, Fi.

I know I go a bit weird and wonky sometimes.

I love you, you know.

I know.

(loud moaning)

... in a tool shed that just fit together really fucking well.

But still by the end I'd be like "Go on, you go up to bed,

I'm just gonna catch a little bit more of the news", and then

I'd find myself, you know, watching re-does and like hot times in earlier relationships!

I've got a beautiful woman upstairs waiting to have sex with me and I find myself watching re-does of my hot times in earlier relationships.

Easy!

(computer) Lip read reconstruction enabled.

(automated voice Fi)

Hey, it's good to see you.

(automated voice Jonas)

Good to see you too.

I was nervous when I heard you were going to be here.

It's weird isn't it?

Morning.

Gina, over here.

Come here a second, I just want your opinion.

It's just a silly game.

Sit down.

Just answer this.

No, I'm a serial monogamist.

I'm staying faithful to my cornflakes right now.

Now, is that funny?

Er...

There's no need to be nice, the man's a prick.

Is that funny in your opinion?

Well...

No, I'm a serial monogamist.

I'm staying faithful to my cornflakes right now.

Erm, no.

No.

- I dunno.

- You do.

- Hey.

- Hi.

What's this?

Oh, I'm just getting Gina's opinion on something.

No, I'm a serial monogamist.

I'm staying faithful to my cornflakes right now.

I was just wondering because you found it funny but it clearly isn't, and Gina agrees.

I didn't really wanna get involved.

Gina, let me get you a cab.

(Gina) My dad's on his way.

Just one, just one, one other thing. We both wanted him to come back, but who wants him to come back more?

In your opinion, off the top of your head, who wants him to come back more?

(Jonas) Okay, well, bye.

(Ffion) Yeah, bye.

Wow, it's early. It's early to call it a night.

(Jonas) Well do you fancy a quick one down the pub?

(Liam) Oh, we've gotta get back, rescue Jody from the paedophile baby sitter!

Oh, that's just a, that's a joke.

Sorry.

Jonas, why don't you come back to ours for a nightcap if you want?

Yeah. Yeah.

(bangs on door)

No, ignore the joke.

Who's more keen for him to come back?

I don't know.

I'll see you out.

(Liam) You do know, Gina.

(Ffion) I'm so sorry, he's really hung over.

(Gina) That's okay.

I'm staying faithful to my cornflakes right now.

That is just objectively not funny.

Anyone would say that's not funny.

That was fucking embarrassing.

Whatever you're cueing up, stop it.

Sit down, please.

Do you see that?

You know Jeff?

(Liam) Yes.

(Jonas) Yeah, you remember meeting Jeff 'cause he would have shown you, I don't know, a re-do of the side of his fridge, something like that.

Spot the difference.

You're drunk.

I'm the difference.

He's the greatest guy in the world, and then I arrive and... you clam.

For clarity.

We're just talking!

But moments later you're so stiff.

I don't know, a re-do of the side of his fridge...

(Liam) You don't know how to stand around him.

Your gauges are all over the place, hot and cold.

This is just stupid!

But you can't hide it, not completely.

See how you look at him.

The less the relationship means, the more you spend on the wedding.

I mean really, you start obsessing over these tiny little details, and the thickness of the wedding invitation paper.

Now, how you look at me.

Well I think it's an interesting choice going grainless

(Liam) It's a brave choice.

I'm sorry but...

Tell me you look at me nice like you look at him.

You can't.

And how am I looking at you now, Liam?

How long did you go out with him for?

Does it matter?

You know half the organic memories you have are junk.

Just not trustworthy.

Well, when it comes to little things.

And big ones.

(Liam) Is that Marrakech?

Does that look like Marrakech?

No.

It's not Marrakech.

So how long did you go out with him for?

Alright, about six months.

So not a, not a week or a month, six months?

The ever-inflating romance.

You're probably still going out with him.

Why am I on trial here?

What's been going on?

Nothing has been going on!

It was...

Christ you know how it is when you first get with someone and then previous boyfriends come up.

He was never a boyfriend, it was always a weird week.

I down-played it,

I fudged it, it was ...

You lied?

Not everything that isn't true is a lie, Liam.

Hello?

Yeah, alright he was a bigger thing than I made out, and yeah he's sort of a dick.

Sort of? He's a massive...

But I, and I liked him then, and

I don't like him, not like that, not now.

So just to get this clear.

He fucks you, gets footage for his re-do wank file, but you're still pally?

This is sad!

You know, 'cause if he was...

This is just sad.

... he probably sits there and tosses himself off all over his cashmere blanket.

It was years ago!

Not for him.

I find myself, you know, watching re-does of really hot times in early relationships.

Easy.

Ah, sober up, make yourself puke, whatever, I don't care, just sort this out.

Fuck!

I find myself, you know, watching re-does of like really hot times in early relationships.

Easy!

And I'm downstairs watching some re-do of, of some night,

I've picked up somebody else and...

Yeah, nice, Jeff.

She's upstairs, waiting to have sex with me, and I'm downstairs watching some re-do of some night I've picked up somebody else.

Easy!

And I'm fucking pulling myself off!

Ah, she's not, no.

Sorry Liam mate, is there something that you want?

Yeah I just wanna, I just wanna come in and talk to you, can you open the gate?

Yeah, yeah, yeah sure, no problem, I'll let you in.

Nice, nice one.

Hey.

Hey.

What do you want?

I just wanted to come in for a bit, dude.

That looks expensive, is that expensive?

Look, Liam, this morning, mate...

Oh, fucking hell.

Liam!

Jonas, this is a nice place.

Hey, seriously, man.

Look, it's not cool you just walking in like this, and to be honest with you it's a little bit weird.

Is that a Marakeechian lamp?

Liam, do I have to call Fi?

Did you guys have a row or something like that?

- Sit down.

- No, I'm alright.

Go on, sit down, it's not a bear trap, it's your chair.

Do you want me to bounce this off your fucking head?

I'm joking, Jonas!

Bloody hell, I thought you was supposed to be cool, man, you're meant to be fucking brilliant.

What's going on?

Yeah, that figures.

Get some good stuff for the scrap book?

I think you should go.

I don't blame ya, I would have.

Tell you what, let's have a look.

Go on, chuck it on the screen. Don't be shy.

Go on.

I'm fucking joking again, Jonas.

For goodness sake, you need to grow a sense of humour.

He's uptight, ain't he?

(Jonas) Okay, Liam.

It's a lovely room this.

Thank you.

Is this where you masturbate to images of my wife?

Or do you do it in that room?

Okay, Liam, I want you to leave now.

Do you sometimes start in there and then finish in there?

'Cause the world's pretty much your oyster innit?

I want you to leave.

Oh, well, that's a pity.

Come on mate.

Oh no, what you doing?

What are you doing!

(clunk)

- (Hallam) What are you doing?

- What are you doing?

Jesus! Get out!

Stand up, Jonas, come on.

(rewind)

Hey. What do you want?

Don't do that!

Go on ...

- What are you doing?

- What are you doing?

(Liam) Stand up, Jonas, come on.

(Hallam)

Get out, you fucking prick!

I tell you what...

(Hallam) Stop it!

I'll tell you what you're gonna do, yeah?

You're gonna get every bit of

Fi you've got in there, you're gonna select it all and you're gonna wipe it!

Hello, Police, I'm witnessing a serious assault at 5 Hartford...

(Liam) Wipe it!

(Jonas) Fuck off!

(Hallam)

I don't have a grain feed to show you, I don't have a grain.

(bottle breaks)

I'll tell you what, right either you wipe it or I will fucking gouge you myself!

Okay.

(Hallam) Just do what he says.

(Liam) Not on your eye, in there, on there.

(Hallam) He's doing it!

Now delete it all, the lot, or I will crack your skull and I will gouge your fucking neck.

(Jonas) I'm doing it.

Stay away from my house!

Now delete it all, the lot!

Or I will crack your skull and

I will gouge your fucking neck.

I'm doing it.

Liam?

Where did you go?

What happened?

Liam, what happened?

Did you use a condom or not?

Just say.

Yeah, well, whatever you think.

Am I Jody's father?

- Liam?

- Am I?

Yes, of course.

You sure about that?

Yes!

That's nice.

Always liked that picture didn't you?

That's why I bought it for you.

I never liked it.

Thought it was pretentious shit.

I tell ya what you're gonna do, yeah, you're gonna get every bit of Fi you've got on there...

Christ, what have you done?

I'm getting to the good part.

Hello, Police, I'm witnessing a serious assault at...

18 months ago in this room ...

You know when you suspect something?

It's always better when it turns out to be true.

It's like I've had a bad tooth for years and I'm just finally getting my tongue in there and I'm digging out all the rotten shit.

That's not what it looks like.

Oh, did Jonas come round to read you a story?

No, it was...

A story about fucking?

It was... when all the Dan stuff was going on, and you'd walked out.

For like ten minutes.

For five days, Liam.

No call, no nothing.

So you fucked him after four days?

That's heroic.

I mean three days, that's admirable, but four days.

I mean you must have been gagging.

I was upset.

We went for a drink, I got drunk.

It shouldn't have happened.

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry, I can't,

I can't say anything else.

I love you!

Did you use a condom?

Yes.

'Cause we didn't have any here, we were trying.

He had some.

In his pocket?

In his car.

Was it his decision or did you make him wear one?

I made him.

And you saw him put it on?

Yes.

Show me then.

Show me on there.

I need to see it, Fi.

I deleted it.

I wanted it to go away,

I wiped the whole thing.

Did you?

Yeah.

So it's just a blank gap in your timeline?

Yeah.

Show me that then.

Yeah, okay.

I have to find it.

No!

No deleting it, not now!

No, no.

It's still on there is it?

I'm sorry.

You have to show it to me, Fi.

Why?

'Cause I want to see it.

I love you.

Show it to me.

No.

Show it to me.

- No.

- Show it to me!

- No!

- Show it to me!

I want to see what, what he looks like!

This isn't me, look what you're doing to me!

Fi, I need to see it!

Please?

I need to see it, Fi.

Nothing.

The way that your eyes were open, it scared me.

You'd prefer if I close them?

What, when you're sleeping? Um, yeah?

I don't really need to sleep.

Well, just try next time.

Can I get you anything?

No.

Coffee, sandwich?

I said no.

Ash, look sorry...

It's just... a bit odd.

I can appreciate it's

"pretty strange."

I just need a bit of, just getting used to it.

And I shouldn't have drunk last night.

Next time could you try and stop me.

Stop you drinking?

Yeah.

So I get to enjoy being a bit of a bastard?

What's wrong?

Oh, God. Shit, right.

Get in the bedroom.

- What?

- Now!

Hey!

Hey.

Can I come in?

Yeah, yeah.

Look at you, the town mouse has become the country mouse.

Yeah, it's nice.

Was this all you?

Do you want a cup of coffee?

Yeah.

You weren't answering calls... or messages.

It's been really busy.

I've just been a bit like,

"Oh, shit"

You know what's...?

Well, you know.

Yeah, works been mad.

Yeah, let's...

Meet up more, yes. Keep in touch yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Alright, come here.

I think it's great you're moving on.

What?

Sorry. There were...

There were man clothes, you know.

In the bathroom?

Right.

Is he nice?

Sorry. Big nose. You know.

You deserve whatever you want.

Thanks.

Alright.

Okay. Alright.

Hey, is everything alright?

Yeah, I'm fine.

It's fine.

What did your friend say?

That was my sister.

You know her.

She said that I was...

She said that she was happy that I moved on.

Moved on to what?

Is that not the sort of thing I'd say?

I mean... it is, isn't it?

Are you sure everything's alright...

Yes!

Shit.

Its okay, I can do it.

I can do it.

I can do it.

Don't!

We need to wrap that in paper.

Look, if you're going to pretend to be asleep, you could at least breathe, okay? It's just eerie.

Like this?

(breathes heavily)

It doesn't work. I can tell that you're faking it.

Would you like me to have sex with you?

Can you just go downstairs?

Okay.

No! That's...

Ash would argue over that.

He wouldn't just leave the room because I'd ordered him to.

Okay.

What, n....

Ah, fucking hell...

Don't cry, darling.

Oh, don't!

Just get out!

Get out!

Go on!

So you do want me to go?

Just get out!

You are nothing,

- I don't do that.

Fucking fight me!

Hit me!

Hit me!

Hit me, come on!

Why are you just standing there taking this?

How can you take this?

Did I ever hit you?

No, no, of course you didn't... but you might've done if I done this!

Or this...

I don't... I don't know.

Maybe you would have, but you wouldn't, would you?

You wouldn't.

I could insult you.

What?

There's tons of invective in the archive.

I liked speaking my mind.

I could throw some of that at you.

Get out of this house!

What are you doing?

I can't go more than 25 metres from my activation point.

What is that, a joke?

Look, I know it sounds mental.

Where's your "activation point"?

At the risk of blowing your mind, it was where I was activated.

The bath?

I have to keep within a 25 metre radius unless my administrator, that's you, is with me.

Don't call me your administrator.

Why not?

Because ...

It sounds sort of sexy.

(laughs)

If you're laughing, can I come back inside?

This wouldn't have ever happened but if it had, he would have worked it out.

Sorry, hang on. That's a very difficult sentence to process.

Jump.

What? Over there?

I never expressed suicidal thoughts. Or self-harm.

Yeah well, you aren't you, are you?

That's another difficult one, to be honest with you.

You're just a few ripples of you.

There's no history to you.

You're just a performance of stuff that he performed without thinking, and it's not enough.

Come on.

I aim to please.

Aim to jump. Just do it.

Okay.

If you're absolutely sure.

See, Ash would've been scared.

He wouldn't have just leap off, he would have been crying, he would have been...

Please, don't make me do it.

Hey, Ash.

Hey.

The birthday girl.

Just gonna come and hang out for a bit.

Okay.

I wasn't doing anything.

I brought you some cake.

Hello?

Ah...

Hello?

Hello.

Do you know who I am? I... I...

I cant remember who I am.

Hello?

Please!

I cant remember.

Lady, help me!

Oh! Help!

Back! Get back!

Get back. Back!

Let me in. Let me in!

Help me! Help me!

Shit!

Theres a door round there.

Its locked.

You dont know that!

Theres a keypad.

We should try it.

Get down! Anybody stands up, theyll shoot their heads off.

Hes trying to kill me!

Whats going on?

Shut up! Im trying to think!

He can see you. Get back.

Oh, my god!

Whats wrong with those people?!

Why arent they helping us?

Theyre just watching...

Where the fuck have you been?

What?

Get that extinguisher.

I cant! I cant do it!

Get it. Get it now!

OK... OK... OK...

OK... OK...

Come on.

Quickly. Slide it to me.

Damien, if he climbs through, you grab him and you grab his gun.

I cant...

You can.

Hell shoot me!

You have to!

Im going to smash the lock off that door, you help him with gun guy.

He cant shoot all of us.

If he fires, he has to reload.

We either rush him or run, OK?

I cant do this!

We have no choice!

Help him.

Urgh!

Damien!

Oh, my...

Get him!

Urgh! Urgh! Urgh!

Get down.

Shh!

Fuck!

Shh!

No.

We have to go, come on.

Shit.

Stay down.

Shit.

Stay down.

Who are they?

Why do they look like that?

They like scaring people.

What?

OK. We have to run for that opening.

No, theyll see us.

If theyre busy with him we can lose the hunters, OK?

No.

You just stay with me. OK?

OK.

Ready... Come on...

Wait.

Wait!

The onlookers sometimes wait in the windows, keeping lookout.

Im pretty sure thats how they find us. Through the cameras somehow.

Onlookers spot you and a few minutes later the scary bastards turn up.

This is mad, this is just mad.

Hold it together and do what I say or youll get us killed.

I...

I woke up in this house and I dont even know if its my house.

I dont even know who I am.

You must know something.

Ah!

I think this is my daughter.

But you dont know?

She could be anywhere.

Maybe you tried to kill yourself.

Would that explain it?

There was pills.

I dont blame you.

Lots have tried that fun fork in the road since it started.

Since what started?

You really dont know?

No.

There was a signal... Like pictures, flashing pictures.

They just appeared on every TV, every computer, anything with a screen.

Argh!

Ugh!

I saw it. I saw it.

Get down.

They did something to people.

Like, almost everybody just became onlookers, started watching, filming stuff, like spectators who dont give a shit about what happens.

Thats, like, nine out of ten people now.

But not us.

Some of us werent affected.

I dont know why.

Like that man with the gun and that woman.

I call them "hunters". You mightve noticed thats what they do.

They seemed normal, but they realised they could do what they wanted and they started taking stuff, nicking cars cos they could, doing what they like and not just with things, with people.

It got worse and worse.

And now theyve got an audience.

So this... This thing on the TV, the...

The signal.

Thats whats making them act like this?

I guess they were always like that underneath.

Just needed the rules to change, for no-one to intervene.

What we going to do?

What we going to do?

Do? Do nothing. We get out.

Wheres "out"?

Were here.

We need to head south of here.

Theyve knocked the transmitters out, its OK there.

The TV transmitters, they carry it.

Theres only one between us and the safe zone and were going to knock it out. See, its here.

White Bear.

What?

White Bear...

Uh! Ungh!

A picnic with my two best friends.

Jesus, what is it with you?

White Bear, you said White Bear...

So?!

Look, whatevers wrong with you, you have to keep it together. OK?

Listen to me! Dont go out there.

Whats your problem?

Huh? You want something to look at?

Cos Ill give you something to look at!

No, I want to talk to him.

I want to talk to you!

Ah!

Its not so funny now, is it?

Put it down.

I just want to see what theyre looking at.

I said put it down.

Its dangerous.

Their phones, theyre dangerous.

Its the signal. The images are on them, theyre on the screen.

What?

Dont look at it!

Dont look at it.

Jemima...

No, no. This is all wrong.

This is all wrong!

Theyre coming. Run! Run!

Get in.

Get in. Come on.

Come on.

Come on, now! Theyre coming!

Quick.

Come on, hurry up. Get in.

You nearly killed us back there.

Yeah, well, I wasnt expecting you to be there, was I?

I just saved your lives.

A wee thank you would be nice.

I shouldve just run yous over.

Who are you?

Who are you?

Its not a hard question, is it?

I know... I know you.

Do you? Well, where did we meet, if you know me?

No. Didnt think so, yeah.

Shes not in a good way.

Yeah, Ill say.

So what are yous doing out here anyway?

Heading south.

Thats not a good move.

Its all blocked up down there.

Theres a transmitter there...

I dont think you understand.

When I said, "Its not a good move", that means Im not driving you down there.

I know a safe place we can go.

The woods.

Your safe place is in the woods.

Howd you know that?

I dont... I dont know.

Christ, maybe you do know me.

Yeah, we pull up and we get out.

We talk. Theres no-one chasing us.

Mystic Meg.

And then what happens?

We eat.

Told you. No bars.

Theyll never find us here.

That your daughter?

Yeah, I think so.

Where is she?

I dont know.

Whatd you do to your wrists?

Dont know.

History of mental illness?

Yeah, I bet you do. Lay money on it.

What about you?

What about me?

Mental illness, weaknesses...

Everyones got weaknesses.

Yeah, you two have got more that most, Id say.

Thats why youre on the receiving end, you see. Vulnerable.

Receiving end of what?

This. Everything thats going on.

Easy pickings.

Whats your weaknesses then?

My weaknesses?

Show you if you want.

You want to see it?

Wait there dont move.

Youre going to like this.

Not a lot.

This better not be naturism.

Yeah, in your dreams.

Tada!

Run and Ill shoot you in the back.

Right, come over here.

Stand there.

You, here, put this on.

Put it on. Backwards, so it covers your eyes.

Put your hands on her shoulders.

Keep them there.

Youre her eyes now, all right?

And that is a shotgun, OK?

If I pull this trigger, its going to cut you, both in half.

So no funny business, all right?

Right, off you go.

Straight ahead.

Keep going through the trees.

Come on, pick up the pace.

Got a lovely playground for you down there.

Thats it, through here.

Thats it, straight ahead.

Grab her!

Right, now take her balaclava off.

Get down there.

Oh, fuck.

Come on.

Head towards that ladder.

Get down there.

Right, stop. Get on your knees, both of you. Give me that bag.

Fucking bag.

You, get down.

Stop whingeing.

Stop fucking crying.

Stop it. Eurgh!

Yeah.

Im down in that wood spot.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Easy.

Ill just lash them to a tree or something like that.

Just hurry up and get down here.

I want to get started.

Its going to piss... Fuck!

Your mates fucked off. Youre in double trouble now, missus.

Get up on that log. Now! move!

Get your hands through there.

Get your hands through there!

Right through.

Push your arms up. Push them!

Get them up there!

Are we going to put a show on for these guys today, eh?

Eh?

Lets see what Daddys got in the bag, shall we? Oh...

Oh! Oh, mama.

Help me! Help me!

Please, just help me!

Why are you doing this to me?

Whoa-ha! Oh yeah!

Help me, please. Im a human being!

Theyre not going to help you.

Theyre going to watch.

What Im going to do here darling, is just going to push this straight through your...

Help me!

Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you!

For what?

For coming back for me.

I came back for this.

Theres more like him on the way.

Come on.

Whitebears not far from here.

If we step on it we might be able to shut it down before they get us.

- What happens if we cant shut it down?

- We can.

How? Do we hack into it, or something?

We dont hack anything.

We burn the control room down.

Its not hard, we just slosh a load of petrol round, strike a light and fucks the electrics or something.

Here.

In the bag.

Its the plans for the transmitter compound.

Ive been planning this, you know.

Jemima?

Lie down for me, darling. Go on.

Its a game.

Yeah, just like what Teddy does.

Lie down for me, darling.

Turn around!

What?

White Bear, theres something not right about White Bear. I remember!

You "remembered" the woods, too.

Sorry if I dont trust your hunches.

OK. Looks clear.

OK.

He was good for something, after all.

Hurry up, we need to go!

Come on... Get out...

Come with me...

A picnic with my two best friends.

Come on.

This way.

Oh, shit. Theyll be here any minute. Give me the plan.

The transmitter towers over there and the cabling runs underground into that building.

Come on!

Thought so.

Lets go!

Get back.

Or everything goes up.

I mean it... Stay back.

Stay back.

Wh, wh, wha, what...?

Thank you.

So. I guess youre wondering why youre here?

Well, its time to tell you who you are.

Youve looked better.

Do you recognise him?

Uh... Yeah.

Your fiance, lain Rannoch.

Or, should I say, was your fiance.

In case you havent guessed, the pair of you arent very popular.

But Ill tell you what you are though.

Youre famous.

The trial of Victoria Skillane finally concluded today, the verdict, guilty.

Together with her fiance lain Rannoch, whose death in custody had delayed the trial,

Skillane abducted six-year-old

Jemima Sykes just miles from her home, prompting a nationwide search amidst emotional pleas from her parents.

For months, the youngsters disappearance had been a mystery, the sole clue being her distinctive white teddy bear, discovered in a lay-by two miles from the family home.

The white bear became an enduring symbol in the hunt for Jemima, a hunt that ended in a local forest.

Jemimas body was found here.

It had been wrapped in a sleeping bag and burnt.

The couple were caught after harrowing footage of Jemimas torture and murder was discovered on a mobile phone in Skillanes possession. lain Rannoch, identified by his distinctive tattoo, killed the youngster as

Victoria Skillane held the camera.

Breaking down in tears,

Skillane admitted to filming

Jemimas final moments, claiming her fiance had pressured her into helping him, maintaining she was under his spell.

The jury was not convinced by

Skillanes story, and neither was the judge, who labelled her a "uniquely wicked

"and poisonous individual.

"You were an enthusiastic spectator to Jemimas suffering.

"You actively revelled in her anguish", he said, adding her punishment would be proportionate and considered.

By hanging himself in his cell, many believe lain Rannoch evaded justice.

The public mood is now focussed on ensuring his accomplice

Cant do the same.

Patrick Lacey, UKN.

Please!

Oh, dont start crying.

Crocodile tears are making me sick!

Murderer!

Murderer!

There were no tears when you watched him do what he did.

You filmed what he did.

A poor wee girl.

Helpless and terrified and you just watched.

How do you like it now?

HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?!

Murderer!

Murderer!

Murderer!

Get her out of here.

Throw her back to where she came from.

No! No! Please...

NO! Please!

Good evening, citizens!

Thank you so much for coming tonight. OK!

Were at the climax of our day.

Take as many photographs as you want, take as many photographs as you can, but most importantly, what I need from you is to shout and scream and let that bitch know that youse are out here.

Lets get this show on the road!

Murdering bitch!

Evil witch!

Dirty whore!

Burn the bitch!

Murderer!

Burn in hell!

Kill me. Please just kill me.

Please...

Thats what you always say.

♪ Doo-ba-doo-ba-do... ♪

Youve had a bad day, but this will wipe it clean.

Get you in the mood to start again.

No! Please! Get off me!

What are you doing?

Takes about 30 minutes... for it to fully do the business.

So while it does...

Why dont we watch some in-flight entertainment?

Please, no.

Healthy stuff, like apples.

Please stop.

You should enjoy this.

You shot it.

Made it together, so that my two friends...

Erm... A picnic for me and my two best friends.

Help me.

OK everyone, were about to head into the park so Ill hand you over to Baxter.

Thank you.

All of our roles are very, very important, yours included.

Now, yours come with some basic rules.

Rule number one, no talking, not just to her, but each other as well, unless its essential.

Were trying to get her to believe that youse are all mesmerised.

I know, I know, I know, but shes believed it up to now.

Morning, ticket please.

Thank you.

OK, rule number two, keep your distance.

I cant stress the importance of this one enough, OK?

Dont forget, shes a dangerous individual.

Imagine that shes an escaped lion.

Now yesterday, she threw a projectile, and we will step in if she gets too close.

Were all equipped with tasers, but then were into story shutdown and weve all wasted a day.

So its best to keep your distance at least three metres back.

You can use your camera zoom.

Last, but not least, enjoy yourself.

Thats probably the most important rule of all, OK?

Take photographs, run around through the woods, but try and stay safe.

Well be keeping an eye on you, making sure youre all OK.

So get out there, enjoy yourselves and lets make this show happen, people! Come on!

Ow!

Look, there she is.

Dont know yet.

Im kind of knackered.

Me, too.

Shes just leaving her house now.

Two minutes tops.

Right, you are. Were on.

Watch out!

Hes trying to fucking kill me.

Whats going on?

Get that extinguisher.

Its OK, theyve gone.

Convincing, eh?

We got two minutes.

Help!

Help me!

Early screamer.

Its an early screamer tonight.

So keep the noise up and lets go!

Ow!



## 3. The Waldo Moment



Ahem.

Theyre ready for you.

Gwendolyn Harris. Weve met.

Bournemouth.

But you dont know the others.

No, but Im familiar with you.

Why do you want to be an MP?

Because Im not satisfied with the way things are, and rather than sit back and moan

Id prefer to do something about it.

Go again from the top.

I dont know why anyones surprised the worlds number one teen idol has become a Scientologist.

Speed up the autocue, please.

Pop stars do believe in weird things.

Abba believed in angels.

R Kelly believed he could fly...

They said show you this.

This happened just now?

Mm-hmm.

Gladwell?

"Shamed Tory Jason Gladwell resigns," - capitals -

"over Twitter porn pics scandal."

Oh, so he wasnt hacked after all.

"Originally claimed his account had been hacked,

"resignation statement admits inappropriate correspondence

"with a 15-year-old girl."

So tweeting dick photos is correspondence now, is it?

"Departure triggers a by-election

"in his Stentonford and Hersham constituency."

Well, you get to use the Gladwell stuff.

Mm-hmm.

Bump it all up to the top of the monologue.

Anyone seen Jamie?

Rach?

You really shouldnt be calling me any more.

You need to sort yourself out.

I am.

Focus on Waldo, thats going well for you.

But it is not...

Hes a hit, Jamie.

"He." Not me, "he".

Just do your show.

I will. I mean, hon, if youd just...

Jamie?

Jamie, hurry up.

What do you know about

Stentonford and Hersham?

Safe Tory seat.

So, realistically, I know theres not much of a chance, but...

So, its a stepping stone for you?

Yes.

Obviously, I wouldnt say that outside of this room, but, well, you want me to be honest.

Theres no point in pretending.

Is there anything in your past that might conceivably cause problems?

No.

Except...

I did commit a series of murders in Huddersfield between 1999 and 2003.

But apart from that...

Well, thank you, Gwendolyn.

If you could leave via that door.

Oh, that door?

We like to keep the candidates separate.

Right, yes.

Idiot. Idiot!

Shamed super groomer and all-round pillock of the community

Jason Gladwell has resigned as an MP, saying he could no longer maintain his position.

That position, presumably, being hunched over wanking madly at school kids.

A pal of Gladwell said...

You ready?

Uh-huh.

How old the girl wasnt.

Thats the sort of feeble excuse only a naive school kid would swallow - which, presumably, was the idea.

Anyway, the bad news is hes resigned in disgrace.

The good news is hes now free to pursue a full-time career in the disgraced paedophile industry.

Personally, I dont understand why anyones surprised...

Um, small change to the intro.

What?

- Nothing huge, Conor wanted the Jacko gag for the monologue, so...

- That was my bit.

- There is the Chancellor stuff, you could use that.

- Bit politics.

You can do politics.

I do piss-taking.

Go be Waldo.

Yes, commander.

R Kelly believed he could fly, and Michael Jackson believed that his doctor was qualified...

Big ball blue bear bollocks.

And now its time for our final visit to the world of educational childrens programming courtesy of everyones favourite, and only occasionally inappropriate cool kids TV character,

Waldo.

Whose mums in tonight, apparently.

Waldo, who have you had in your cave this week?

Well, Conor, in my big pink cave this week

I had former Minister for Culture Liam Monroe.

Oh, hes quite handsome, isnt he?

I was hoping hed nosh me off!

Want to see how it panned out?

I think we should.

Run VT!

Hey, everybody!

Its Waldo time!

Yeah!

Cool! Cool!

Waldo-rrific!

Ha-ha-ha!

Hey, kids, my guest this week is Mr Monroe.

Hello, Mr Monroe.

Hello, Waldo.

Mr Monroe is a politician.

So, what is a politician, Mr Monroe?

Well, a politician is someone who tries to make the world a fairer place.

Like Batman.

Not exactly like Batman.

Do you beat people up?

No, I dont beat people up.

Oh, youre a pussy then?

Well, Im not sure

I know exactly what...

You dont know what pussy is?

OK, this is clearly some kind of joke.

No joke, sorry, lets move on.

Friends again?

Oh, hello, mate, great show.

Well done, really good.

So, well bring him over.

You go and get him,

Ill explain about...

Now, he comes across...

Jamie!

What you want, Miss Tamsin?

Behind me, man in glasses talking to Jack Napier.

- Jack freaks me out.

- Yeah, ditto, but he owns the company and the man hes with is important and wants to talk to you.

Hes from the channel.

Go on.

- Honestly, all Im saying...

- Is he shy?

No, all Im saying is hes a terrific guy...

Jim, Jamie, Jamie, Jim.

How do you do?

Jim, Jack, James.

Jamie.

Jim was just talking about Waldo.

Yeah. Liam Monroe has lodged a complaint.

Toys out the pram.

And thats...?

Good press.

Its so tough to get a breakthrough these days, but when it does, well, its just fantastic.

Its fantastic the way Waldo puts the piss up Monroe.

You know, all those twats, its punk, its... its...

Jack?

Excuse me.

Well, Twitter cant get enough of Waldo, loves him.

Look, I know the shows coming back again next year, but we want to see more of Waldo.

They want to do a pilot.

A Waldo pilot?

Yeah. I mean, how does that sound?

Yeah. Sounds good.

Sounds stormin Norman, fucking stormin.

Going to give it to em.

But look, we cant do sketches without Waldo.

Its a Waldo pilot, its a Waldo show, its got to be Waldo, Waldo, Waldo.

Realistically, there isnt the budget for other animations.

I mean live action, other characters I can do.

What about the Brown Knight?

What, the crap crusader?

We can look into the Brown Knight.

But right now lets find more Waldo ideas.

The problem is, any guests we book will be in on it.

They know that Waldos a joke, the surprise is gone.

So, we think round that.

Hey, boys and girls!

Its Waldo time!

Yeah! Ha-ha!

Hes awesome, isnt he?

I mean, look - sod name in lights, youre an app now, my brother.

All right, Sara? Hows the think tanking going, good shit?

Um, yeah, yeah, were making headway.

Good.

I see our friend Monroe is in the news again, running in the Stentonford by-election.

We should get Waldo down there.

Hey, thats not a bad idea, actually.

We get a van with a screen with the image of Waldo on the side.

Like it.

And then, when Monroes doing a meet and greet, we just turn up and just get under his skin.

I love that, I love it.

Weve done Monroe.

But it was a great bit.

Im not dumb or clever enough to be political...

Why dont we get Waldo to stand for the by-election?

- Get people to vote for him?

- Hes not real.

But people have stood as fictional characters before.

Do you think Screaming

Lord Sutch was his real name?

We just put "commonly known as" on the ballot.

No-ones actually going to vote for him, thats not the point.

The point is, we get to hang around, were there for the count.

Well, go on then, Sara, whack it up there.

Hes with a mum and baby group.

OK. Going live in five... four... three two...

Thank you so much for joining me this morning.

Its been incredibly informative and I think we should have a little round of applause for the children, who were fantastic.

Thank you, Naomi.

Thank you for your time.

Hey!

Hey, its me Waldo.

Oh. I like your trainers, man!

Id wear trainers myself but I cant cos I havent got feet.

Ive got stumps.

Hes out.

Hey, Mr Monroe! Mr Monroe.

Hey! Did you get off with any of the mums?

Whered you look while they were breastfeeding?

They got big milky tits, Mr Monroe!

He said it!

Mr Monroe, dont walk away from me!

- Im sorry about this, Liam.

- Hey, Im being snubbed!

Hey, dont ignore me.

Dont just get in your car.

Its a death trap anyway, look at it!

Lets find out what we can about the idiot inside that thing.

Sure.

Mr Monroe. Oi!

Stentonford Labour Party.

Right, youve got a choice of styles, so just choose one from there.

Then you put your name in there.

This is like bloody Moonpig.

Dont knock the free mail out.

Bet Liam Monroe doesnt use some

Fisher-Price leaflet app.

He doesnt have to.

Day one of the campaign in Stentonford and Hersham, and Tory hopeful Liam Monroe hits the ground running.

The license fee is something thats very close to my heart...

Mr Monroe, ey! Oh, oh, oh!

Look at me Mr Monroe, please!

Hey, over here! Hey, over here...

Look over here, Mr Monroe...

The Conservative Party have been, er...

Have been arguing for a reduction of the license fee for...

- Good morning, everybody.

- Pardon?

Why you ignoring me, Mr Monroe?

Mr Monroe? Why you ignoring me?

I beg your pardon.

Im sorry. Its rather loud.

We have argued for a further reduction in the license fee...

Mr Monroe? Why you ignoring me?

Mum with a pushchair - drag her into it.

Hey, you. Mum with the pushchair.

Yeah, you. Ask Mr Monroe why hes ignoring me.

Why are you ignoring Waldo?

Mr Monroe, whats Waldo done to you?

We should probably just shift before this turns stupid.

Im not walking away from a cartoon.

Im not ignoring you.

Yeah, you were, you upset me.

You made Waldo sad.

Wa-a-a-a-a-a-ah.

Well, obviously, Im absolutely devastated that youre upset...

WA-A-A-A-A-A-A...

Let him get a word in.

Im not ignoring you because there is no you.

You are an image voiced by a comedian - an alleged comedian, more accurately.

If Im not real, why you talking to him?

And by "him" I mean me, knobber!

Theres no point in attempting to converse with a cartoon.

Ooh, "converse", Your Lordship!

Thy flowery language doth give me a right throbbing bone-on!

Uh-ha-ha-ha-huh!

Uh-er-ha-ha!

Ha-ha-ha-ha-uh-uh-uh!

Uh-uh-uh-oh! Huh!

Finished.

Drink?

Ive got e-mails.

You know thats Gwendolyn Harris?

The Labour candidate.

Did you read my background doc?

Yes.

Why dont you read it tonight? Alone.

Ill swing by about nine, so have your breakfast first...

Are you my dad?

Apparently not. See you tomorrow.

..Waldo the bear left

Monroe in stunned silence.

The colourful Waldo launched his own campaign in typically loud and crowd-pleasing style...

Someones bold? Do I know you?

Nice way to greet a voter...

Sorry, I thought you were...

Actually, Im more of a rival.

"Hey, Mr Monroe, Mr Monroe, why are you ignoring me, Mr Monroe?"

Youre good at that!

Because I am that.

What? Youre that thing?

Waldos not a thing, hes a bear.

Liam Monroe calls him worse.

Nice work there, by the way.

Yeah, well. Its dick jokes at his expense basically.

Another one?

OK. One.

The way you describe it, its like youre doing this for a showreel...

No... like this place is the equivalent of a walk-on in a sketch show...

Shh!

But your party leader has to show up because its a... mid-thing...

Midterm by-election.

Terminology tits.

You are 12!

So because leaderballs is there, suddenly its walk-on in a Ricky Gervais sketch show so its good exposure.

- Youre not going to win, you know youre not going to win...

- Come on, shh.

Youre not going to win though.

Of course not.

So, why not be honest?

Say, "You arseholes arent going to vote for me,

"so heres what I think anyway."?

- It doesnt work like that.

- Nothing does, thats why everythings bollocksed.

Youre angry, for someone whos doing well.

Im the voice of a blue bear... if thats, "doing well," then we are doomed!

I cant see!

Hang on, theres a thing.

Have you had a fox in here or do you live like a 14-year-old?

Well, dont get too excited,

Im not sleeping in it.

Shit, really?

Youre amazing.

Sorry?

Youre amazing?

Oh, thank you!

Whats up?

Nothing.

Are you sure?

Its just...

I havent been happy in a while... and this is good, you know?

Hm.

Can I... have your number?

Yes!

Wheres our mark this morning?

Were out on the road.

Ooh... bien sur.

Oh, hello, Im Mr Monroe.

Vote for me and keep things shitty.

Ha-ha-ha-ha!

Vote Waldo! Vote Waldo!

Youre right. Strong Tory.

I warned you.

You know youre on Monroe turf when they live so far apart.

Im voting Waldo!

I met Waldo last night.

Jamie, the guy who plays him.

Hes fun.

Fun?

Mmm-hmm.

Did you tell him anything about our campaign?

Not really.

Not really or no?

Er, not really.

Look, hes OK.

Hes a comedian - hes mocking Monroe now, itll be you next.

His act is all f-this and penis jokes.

But...

Dont see him again.

OK. Job done till the husting tomorrow.

Some media students doing a Question Time type thing.

Theyve asked Waldo to join the panel.

Oh, come on. Its my nightmare, going on Question Time.

Its students, youll walk it.

I cant answer serious questions...

No-one wants you to!

Youre the comic relief, lighten up.

Erm, just have a look. Im sure youll find lots in there...

Are there any particular issues that youre concerned about at all?

Hey.

Oh, hi.

- I thought we were going to...?

- Sorry - Ive had a tough day...

Right. Not even one?

Sorry.

Well, what about tomorrow?

- Look, I cant, when this is happening,

I cant see you.

- What do you mean?

Im sorry.

Do they think that looks like Question Time?

Yeah. It looks politicsy.

Check the host.

Jailbait Dimbleby.

When it comes to addiction and addicts, we should sympathise, but we shouldnt patronise.

You know, serious drug use is a criminal of fence, that is committed voluntarily and for pleasure...

Look, Im sorry, these are the facts.

Waldo, what do you think?

Mr Monroe, are you addicted?

No.

Sorry, I mean, are you a dickhead?

I think we have to ask ourselves...

I think we have to ask ourselves, what is this for?

And why do we waste our time with animated trivialities like him?

I mean why?

Why? I mean why?

I mean why? I mean why?

I mean why? I mean why?

This is just the kind of thing... rather than see you laugh...

They laugh at you, Limbo.

You laugh, youre laughing at someone who wont engage.

Who is scared to engage, who hides behind a childrens cartoon.

Who you calling a kiddy toon, fool?

Im... Im... Im speaking about James Salter.

Hm?

Dont worry about it.

Thats your name, isnt it?

James Salter, this is the man whos behind all this.

Hes 33 years old, a man whose career can be summed up surprisingly quickly.

You were in a sketch troupe that enjoyed minor success about six years ago, and the others moved on to better things, but your main achievement seems to have been playing the part of a corn on the cob in a high-interest personal loan commercial.

I notice you keep that pretty quiet.

And now of course operating this sort of teddy bear thing.

Which by the way is easier than it looks. Anyone could do it.

See, this is... this is the thing.

Its easy, what he does.

He mocks.

And when he cant think of an authentic joke, which is actually quite often, he just swears.

I think that this puppets inclusion on this panel debases the process of debate, and smothers any meaningful discussion of the issues.

So I return to my original question, is that really what this is for?

He has nothing to offer and he has nothing to say.

Prove me wrong. Hm?

Speak, Waldo.

Please. Come on. Speak up.

There you see, nothing.

Oh, go fuck yourself.

Its more swearing.

Youre a joke.

You look less human than I do and Im a made-up bear with a turquoise cock.

What are you? Youre just an old attitude with new hair.

Assuming youre my superior because

Im not taking you seriously?

No-one takes you seriously, thats why no-one votes.

The vast majority do vote.

Its bullshit.

Surely this is enough?

You think you deserve respect.

Just common courtesy.

Because you went to public school and believed you were entitled to everything.

- Perhaps we could get back...

- Ad hominem nonsense...

Gwendolyn Harris...

Somethings got to change. No-one trusts you lot cos they know you dont give a shit about anything outside your bubble.

What about your mate Gladwell, the kiddy-flasher?

You knew him for 20 years, did you not know what he was like?

No, of course not.

Yeah, cos youre all just front, like him, sly and pretending, and in that way youre all the same.

Gwendolyn Harris, is all of politics a waste of time?

Well, of course I think no...

Oh, shut up, youre worse!

Seriously, shes faker than him.

- For once I agree with Liam Monroe in that this...

- Are you going to win?

Doesnt get us anywhere and theres no point in us continuing...

Tell them why youre here.

If we cant have anything resembling a deba...

Tell them why youre here.

Shes here to build a showreel.

Im not kidding, thats literally it.

Knows shes not going to win.

This is all experience, to get on telly.

She actually gives less of a shit about anyone round here than he does, because hell actually have to represent you.

Am I wrong?

A career politician.

Someone else less real than me, and I can do this.

Can I just make a couple of points?

Oh, shut up, you pebble.

What is this for? Thats what you wanted to know, Mr Monroe.

And the truth is, none of us know any more, thanks to you.

What are you for? What are you for?

Thank you and goodnight.

Jamie.

Jamie?

Jacks here. He wants to see us.

You cant avoid it.

Get dressed, hell meet us outside.

And yet accusations of vapidity aside, its clearly tapped a nerve.

In just three days, Waldo has gone viral.

The video of his clash has already been viewed over a million times on YouTube. There are Facebook groups calling on Waldo to form a national party.

Youre a joke.

You look less human than I do and Im a made-up bear with a turquoise (BLEEP) What are you?

Youre just an old attitude with new hair.

Assuming youre my superior because

Im not taking you seriously.

No-one takes you (BLEEP) seriously.

Oh, look, here he is the man of the moment!

How does it feel to be a phenomenon?

Shitifying.

You are everywhere, my son.

Twitter, the news...

Have you seen the poll?

Youre in third place, mate.

You overtook that Lib Dem prick...

- Yeah, well, hes a glass of water.

- This is an opportunity, Jamie.

He knows my name now.

We could really do something here.

You know, everyones pissed with the status quo.

And Waldo gives that a voice.

Waldos a bear. A blue bear.

Tell him, Tams.

Weve been asked on Consensus.

Its a ten-minute one-to-one interview with Phillip Crane.

Pitbull Crane?

Big guns for big guns.

Hello? Im not a politician, OK?

I dont want to be a politician.

We know that you hate politics.

I dont hate them,

Im just not interested in them.

You dont need to be interested in them.

You just need to be Waldo.

And when Crane asks something tricky and I look stupid because I dont know how to answer?

Youll know the answer.

Because you have a producer.

Look, I can tell you what to say.

I can live Google any facts, give you stats, quotes, whatever else you need.

So youve got a safety net for the concrete stuff and the rest is Waldo and you can do that in your sleep.

Youll piss all over Crane.

Hell know theres a team around me, hell see it.

Yeah good. I hope he does.

I hope he points a camera at it.

All the other MPs have got teams, were just more honest about it.

Now come on. What dyou say? Eh?

Jamie! Jamie!

Why would I want to do this?

Look, the world is knackered and you can do something about it.

I dont know what youre on about.

Waldo has got the attention of the young, and the young dont give a shit about anything except trainers and pirating films.

Do you have any other astounding theories about young people?

Yeah, yeah I do actually.

Look, they care about Waldo.

Theyll vote for Waldo.

The video was a hit for a reason.

The videos embarrassing.

Im embarrassed by it.

I was lashing out.

I wasnt even articulate -

Doesnt matter.

Or funny, which is almost worse.

We can build on that.

Waldos not real.

Exactly! Thats what you said that really hit home. Hes not real, but hes realer than all the others.

He doesnt stand for anything.

Yeah, well, at least he doesnt pretend to.

Look we... we dont need politicians, weve all got iPhones and computers, right?

So any decision that has to be made, any policy, we just put it online.

Let the people vote thumbs up, thumbs down, the majority wins.

Thats a democracy. Thats a... thats an actual democracy.

Sos YouTube and I dont know if youve seen it but the most popular video is a dog farting the theme tune to Happy Days.

Well, today its Waldo.

No. Its still the dog.

Listen, can you imagine all the things we can change if we fuck the politicians out the equation?

Ive said what Ive said and now Im shutting this door.

Do you know who owns Waldo?

I do, I own the rights.

Hes my character.

Yeah, written for my show.

Youre too frightened to take to the next level. Fine. I understand.

But also, fuck off!

And watch me fly.

You own Waldo, you cant be Waldo.

Eh, Jamie, Jamie,

Jamie, whats appenin, eh?

Pretty close, Id say.

Whats happenin? Ahh!

Waldorific, yeah! Yeah!

Why is it going off left again?

Because the...

- I know! Ive got my...

- Put your thumb in the white thing.

I got that. In there? OK.

Thats not how that works.

First tonight, a figure - or more accurately a character - whos been causing an upset in the Stentonford by-election.

Unlike the other candidates, he has no party affiliation.

He doesnt even have a surname.

He is Waldo, a few weeks ago just a cult character in a comedy show.

Today, an official mascot for protest voters.

Vote Waldo.

Cartoons dont play by the rules and Waldos open disdain for his opponents has clearly struck a chord.

Waldo, as a mascot for the disenfranchised, arent you ultimately neutralizing seriously effective dissent?

Can I have subtitles for Mr Crane, please?

By encouraging people not to care, youre actively dangerous.

Dangerous? You think the public cant be trusted?

No.

Isnt that basically you calling them twats?

No, I...

Bell-ends then?

Did you come for a discussion or...

Youre snooty for a glorified

Punch And Judy man, Phil.

You know youre gonna get your best ratings in months cos Im here.

To even get close to the figures

Im gonna pull in for you tonight, youd have to fuck a prawn sandwich live on air.

Make a nice prawn cocktail.

Could we make a serious political point that is...

Ive got one big blue point to make, fool.

- Would you like to have a look at it?

- Oh, God. Thank you.

Great work tonight. Look at... Look at this, look at this.

Its The Waldo polling app.

Now, this can pinpoint you with GPS so that when youre at a polling station, it unlocks loads of free shit, look.

Thanks for voting, dickhead!

Its good, isnt it?

Whos this guy were meeting?

I dunno. But hes from Washington and hes got my restricted number.

Jeff Carter, from the agency.

Hey. Hey.

And Ill leap right in.

I think what youre doing with Waldo is fascinating.

From "the agency"?

Yeah, listen. Waldo may be the perfect political figurehead.

Waldo The Bear.

The bear, people like.

The fact hes a bear is an assist.

- An assist?

- It helps.

Right. You look at human politicians, youre instinctively like,

"brrrr" - uncanny, right?

Like the girls in porn.

You know somethings wrong, cos why else are they doing it?

Its usually daddy issues, eh?

Just like politics.

Waldo bypasses that.

You already know hes not real, so no personal flaws.

Im a person.

With respect, Waldos more than you.

Hes a team, and youre open about that, which is fantastic.

The honesty thing works.

Waldo is a construct people not just accept but embrace.

At the moment hes anti-politics, which is a political stance itself, right?

But he could deliver any brand of political content, minus the potential downsides of a human messenger.

In a debate, your team could Google every word the other guy says, then let Waldo hit him with debunk stats and spit a Twitter-ready zinger into the next sentence.

Hes the perfect assassin.

We wont win, though.

You guys are so British.

No, of course he wont win. You started out too coarse off the bat.

Theres no substantial basis to what you offer, and the whole nihilist "democracy sucks" thing, yeah, is kind of wack-a-doo, but with a targeted, hopeful message, which we can provide, energising the disenfranchised without spooking the middle via your new platform... You got a global political-entertainment product people actually want.

You could roll this out worldwide.

Like Pringles.

Absolutely.

Its, er... Its interesting stuff though.

When youre done with Stentonford, there may be an opportunity in South America.

Se puede hablar espanol?

Vivi en Madrid tres anos.

Excelente.

What?

Hes not coming.

But hes the party leader!

Its too toxic.

Meanwhile, as support for Gwendolyn Harris appears to be dwindling,

Labour denies the party is losing faith in their young candidate.

But Miss Harris spent most of the day locked in crisis talks at party headqu...

In the Stentonford by-election,

Waldo the cartoon bear continues...

Did you see Gwendolyn Harris yesterday?

She looks like shes been poisoned.

Because hes gonna overtake her.

Were still way ahead.

If that thing is the main opposition then the whole system looks absurd.

Which it may well be.

But it built these roads.

Just come in, Roy.

Im sorry, OK?

It was wrong to speak to you like that and...

After the campaign,

I wouldve called you.

After the campaign!

All youve done is strengthen Monroe.

You wont win either, but I was at least attempting to represent...

Well I dont know!

Not just "bollocks to everything".

If you were preaching revolution, well thatd be something, but youre not because that would require courage and a mindset.

And what have you got?

Who are you?

What are you for?

Morning.

So, final push.

You remind everyone thats got the app that if they recommend it to a friend it unlocks a little fez for Waldo.

Were here.

Attention, shoppers.

Im here to ask you an important favour. Gather round.

Come over here and listen.

Dont vote for me. Im an insult.

Seriously.

Vote for Monroe or Harris or, I dunno, UKIP, or even that Lib Dem guy.

Hes a prick!

Seriously, only an arsehole would actually vote for me.

What is this? Irony?

Im worse than a wasted vote.

Hes from the Harris campaign.

I mean it, you idiots!

Dont vote for me!

Dont vote for me!

Dont vote for me!

Dont vote for me!

Dont vmmmf!

Shut up.

No. Dont boo him, hes right! Hes right!

What are you doing?

- Resigning.

- Jamie!

Look! Its me, Im Waldo.

This guy, whoever this guy is, hes a hero.

You should throw stuff at Waldo, hes bad bloody news.

- Hes funny!

- Hes not.

Dont listen to that man, hes a lesbian. Ahh!

So remember, the polls are open, and if youve got my app, you can unlock new stuff like catchphrases and a little hat n that.

Only an idiot wouldnt vote for me so question the status quo!

Kill it! Kill it!

Kick them where it hurts.

The first man to hit him gets 500 quid!

Yeah, thats right. Knock him down.

Knock him down.

Smash it!

Yeah! Yeah!

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah...

I, the undersigned, being the returning officer for the Stentonford and Hersham constituency, hereby give notice that the total number of votes recorded for each candidate at the election is as follows.

Finch, Simon Arthur.

Liberal Democrats.

2,449.

Harris, Gwendolyn Jodie. Labour.

Up you get, come on.

Come on!

Come on. Out you go.

Oi!

Agh!







## 4. White Christmas



Wizzard : I wish it could be

Christmas everyday

When the snowman brings the snow

Well, he just might like to know

He's put a great, big smile on somebody's face 

If you jump into your bed

Quickly cover up your head

Don't you lock the doors

You know that sweet

Santa Claus is on the way 

Well, I wish it could be Christmas every day? 

?When the kids start singing and the band begins to play 

Oh, I wish it could be

Christmas every day. 

I was just getting into that.

What are you doing ?

Roast potatoes.

Were doing Christmas.

Christmas.

Christmas Day, December 25th.

You've heard of it ?

No work today, so the bottles on the table.

I know we didn't have decorations last year. But, er?

I couldn't find them last year.

They're only supposed to have stored essentials here.

I think it's kind of adorable someone thinks tinsel is essential.

I figured it'd be good for us to have a meal, a drink, talk?

Good for you or me ?

Come on.

What has it been, five years ?

How many sentences have you said to me ? Three ?

I mean, I'm exaggerating? a little.

But, come on, there is a little bit of a conversational drought happening here.

My ears need water.

I'm not big on conversation.

- Practice makes perfect.

- Maybe I'll bore you.

Buddy, look, at this point, being bored by anything other than snow would be a relief.

So come on.

Chitchat.

Conversate?

Something.

Come on, for me.

For Christmas.

What do you want to talk about ?

Why are you here ?

No-one ends up here without things going to total shit for them back out there.

It's a job, not a jail.

Often one and the same thing.

So?

?what went wrong for you out there ?

Nothing.

Bullshit.

It's not an interrogation !

What about you ?

An icebreaker.

You're learning.

What went to shit for you ?

- Sure you don't want that drink ?

- Did you talk your way into trouble ?

In a roundabout way.

I talked to people.

Made money from it.

Why ? What were you ?

Some sort of a Los Angeles drive-time DJ ?

I was not a DJ.

More like a guru.

Oh, don't say you were a spiritual guru.

I was decidedly not a spiritual guru.

Hello, Harry. I'm patched through now. How are you doing ?

Sorry, I'm not quite dressed yet.

Don't worry that's why I'm here.

Just show me what you're planning on wearing and well take things from there.

- How about this ?

- Doesn't work.

It's boring blue and you're not boring blue. Not tonight.

Right. Which one of these is good ?

Like I said, white shirt with a black tie with a slim-cut Grey jacket.

Classic, timeless. Smart.

I don't usually do jackets.

You don't usually do anything.

And sort out that hair, because? ok.

Remember those breathing techniques we talked about, ok ?

You're going to do fine.

It's going to be fine.

She's cute.

Yes.

Not out loud.

Absolutely.

You need to pick your spots when you want to talk out loud. ok ?

Ok. The function room is in the back.

Trust me, if you walk in there like you belong, no-one's going to say anything.

Ok.

So what were you running, some corporate espionage outfit ?

Romantic services.

Boy meets girl thanks to?

"in-the-field assistance".

You coached dorks whilst they cruised singles bars.

Singles bars are depressing.

Wed do regular bars and clubs.

But at Christmas time? we'd gate-crash office parties.

See, there's this dynamic to Christmas work parties.

All the attractive women have been surrounded by regulation office ass-clowns for the whole year, and now they want to let their hair down.

According to the pop psychologist.

So I know how the mind works.

Now, don't stand around like a lamppost.

Walk over to the bar.

Remember. Always move with purpose.

Yeah, who's next ?

Yeah. Can I have a? ?

Three pints, a vodka Diet Coke and a shot of tequila.

Yeah. Don't worry about him, all right ?

Just grab one of those empty bottles off the bar while Captain Douchebag orders his piss-water.

Were just going to need it for a prop anyway.

Have a look around.

See anything you like ?

What ? The blonde ?

The dark-haired girl ?

Interesting choice.

Go straight over, but focus on the blonde.

Now. Come on.

Confidence. You can do this.

Hold on, just finding out who they are.

Ok, bullshit opener.

Try the horse story.

At the blonde girl.

Hey, so, did anyone see that guy outside riding the horse ?

- Did you see him ?

- What ? A guy on a horse ?

Yeah, like, 20 minutes ago, this guy, shirtless,

- riding a horse down the high street.

- Really ?

Yeah, honestly. He, er?

The weirdest part was that he had a bow and arrow, right ?

What ? A real bow and arrow ?

I swear to God.

He probably did it for a bet but he looked like something out of Tolkien, you know ?

Sorry, who are you ?

Stall until I? until I find something.

I'm pretty sure I'm me.

Just you're not from the office.

Who do you know from here ?

Say, "I know you." Friendly.

I know you, for one.

Dawson.

Dawson, isn't it ?

You met at Kath's barbecue.

Yeah. We met at

Kath's barbecue back in?

- June.

- ?June or so. Yeah.

He had a pork pie hat.

You had a poor guys hat.

A PORK PIE hat.

A pork pie hat that you wore on your head.

He'll pretend he remembers, even though he won't actually know if he does.

Right.

Yeah ?

Yeah, sorry.

No. No, no worries. No worries.

Crazy night.

You're doing fine.

Don't neglect the blonde.

You, I don't know.

- Amy.

- Amy. Hi.

Get her to introduce you to the dark-haired girl.

So, are all of your friends this suspicious ?

Nice.

I don't think so.

This is Jennifer.

- Hi, Jennifer.

- Hi.

Now focus on Amy and well do that funny material that we worked on.

Anyway, this guy gets off the horse and he's got a backpack, right ?

The tactic, generally, was to deliberately freeze out the one you were actually interested in.

For one thing you wouldn't seem needy but? also they would, most times, sort of lean in naturally.

People want to be noticed.

They don't like to be shut out.

It makes them feel invisible.

But this girl?

This girl seemed content with being ignored.

Maybe she could smell a loser.

No.

No. She was an outsider.

An attractive outsider.

There's nothing more tantalising than that.

Huh. Well, she's off. ok.

Gonna be a challenge. Don't quit.

Lets let our friend Amy here yadder on for a little while and then, uh, find an excuse to slip away.

They will sit outside on the balcony till, like, four in the morning?

Listen, I've just go to the little boys room.

So just keep the party going and I'll, you know?

Sure.

Do you actually have to go ?

Yeah, but it's not easy with you watching.

I promise. I won't peek.

So you streamed everything he saw, and he trusted you with that ?

Well? it was only me watching.

Jesus, how much urine ?

He's pissing like a harpooned cow.

It's making me want to go.

Well, it is !

Ok, there's our girl.

All right, Harry.

Your best bet is to just go over and start talking to her.

You just want to establish a rapport.

Ok. Don't be scared of her.

Ok, guys, any observations so far, helping our man out here ?

Here's what's interesting, she's pretty but no-one's hitting on her.

Probably means they've given up.

She always gives them the brush-off cos?

They're regular types, she's an outsider with zero in common.

Good, that's a possible in.

Harry, engage in conversation, but be cynical. Right ? Cutting.

Like Bonnie and Clyde, huh ?

You two against the world.

Confidence. Confidence.

Just talk to her.

I don't really get parties. You know ?

You just kind of turn up and it's? it's enforced fun, all night.

Talk about what TV shows you've fallen behind on.

Pretend to be happy.

Maybe everyone else enjoys it, maybe it's just me ?

It's definitely not just you.

Good start, now do some more outsider small talk.

And keep looking at her.

I need to gauge her reactions.

So I noticed you sitting alone on the edge and I thought,

"Hey, kindred spirit."

I really hate when people say

"kindred spirit", you know.

And people that do that.

Me too.

Yeah, I guess you don't really like parties either.

The noise wrecks it for me.

All the talking and talking, it never fucking stops.

Ok, she curses, so should you.

Shit, fucking,

I fucking always totally think that it's fucking shit. You know ?

I can't think through all the babble.

I only got through it last year because I was on drugs.

I'm sorry, what's that ?

What's that ?

Just, like, pills, but they must've been pretty strong because I actually enjoyed myself.

That's cool.

Don't say cool.

I wish I had some drugs right now.

No, you don't.

I'm just? I'm joking.

I don't take them any more.

Say, "That's good."

Well, that's good, because you don't?

You don't need that shit in your system, no.

I'd say she's a level four rock chick.

Semi-reformed. Probably respond well to spiritual conversation.

I don't think I can face fucking weeks of that. I might bail, boys.

Ok, look, it's too public here.

Ask if you can move someplace quieter, where you can really talk.

People just want to be heard.

That's why 90% of seduction is just listening.

Or at least pulling a face like you're listening.

That works, too. The important thing is to make them feel important.

Like they can make you want to extinguish the rest of the world and focus on them.

Full attention.

Like you're not giving me now.

What's wrong ?

- That clock.

- What about it ?

I just? I just never noticed it before.

In five years ? Jesus.

Anyway, the point is to stay locked in on them long enough to build a rapport.

So, well, I would guess that either every guy in there has already tried to hit on you or maybe they find you too intimidating.

Am I intimidating ?

No, no, no, no, no. I'm just er?

No, I just imagine that they all kind of want to get in inside your?

Head.

Head.

Some of them have tried.

Not directly. They send messages, or they make it so you know what they're thinking.

Yeah. That can't be fun.

It's just tiring, you know.

It just doesn't end, ever.

- I wouldn't know, I never hit on anyone.

- Really ?

Ok, er? ask her how long she's worked there.

- So, how long you worked for?

- Magson Frank.

?Magson Frank.

Three years.

Oh, wow.

So three Christmas parties?

This will be my last.

Oh, really ? Are you leaving ?

I've been planning it forever, but you know what it's like.

You know you have to do it, but when it comes right down to it, it's hard to work up the courage.

You can empathize with that.

Yeah. It's like when you want to jump into a pool, and you're worried that the waters going to be cold.

But you know moments after you jump in that it'll be fine.

It's the fear of the shock that holds you back.

Ultimately the only thing you're worried about is the transition from one state to another, and that can't hurt you because it's? it's just a state change.

Great stuff, kid.

Almost word-for-word.

That's exactly right, it's just a state change.

Right. And it's frustrating cos you've always got these ten voices in your head saying,

"Don't do it" and another ten in your head saying, "Do it".

Which one do you listen to ?

The "do it" s.

Really ?

Yeah. If you don't like it, you can just cut and run.

You know, get it over and done with.

You're right. I will.

Well.

To changing states.

To changing states.

Sorry.

She touched his knee.

She touched his fucking knee !

Gentlemen, gentlemen, please, please.

Harry, you're doing great. Ask her if she would like another drink.

Listen. Let me get you another drink.

Let me think.

I just need the loo a sec.

So thanks to you some gawko finally meets a girl.

It's not much of a Christmas story.

I haven't finished yet.

Maybe he comes down her chimney.

- I just don't feel comfortable doing this.

- What ?

I mean she? I like her.

She likes you.

It's cheating. I'd never have even had the nerve to talk to her.

Aren't you glad you did ?

Yeah, I? Yes. Yes.

But I just?

It's just a bit of a nightmare having you, you know, all of you in my head, watching us?

Telling me what to do.

I just want to talk to her myself.

And it's? it's a bit of a head-fuck.

I kind of want you all to go away?

Hey.

- Come back to mine.

- Sorry ?

I want you to come back to mine.

I thought about asking you, and a little voice said, "Do it".

So I'm doing it.

Say yes !

I want to do this.

It's my way of saying thanks.

Sorry.

No.

On his first run !

His first bloody run !

- Just say yes.

- Yes. Yes. Yes.

I don't usually bring people back here.

Well, I'm honoured.

Come in.

Did you watch ?

When they went back to hers and got up to whatever they got up to? did you carry on watching through his eyes ?

What do you think I am ?

Clearly, I don't know.

Maybe if you spoke to me more, you'd know.

No.

My job was done.

Of course I didn't watch.

- Here ? - Mm-hm.

- Ok.

Nice place.

I like the mantelpiece? and that bird.

Kooky decor?

Indicating sexual adventurousness.

I'll get the drinks.

- Yeah, ok. I'll just sit?

- The bedrooms that way.

- Yeah, ok.

- I'll meet you in there.

Ok, Harry.

You're going to the moon.

Just sooner than expected.

I can't? I can't do it.

This is first-time nerves.

It's all happening so suddenly.

I didn't expect this, this quickly.

You just got to roll with it.

I don't want you all to see, all right ?

- Oh, now he's Mr Fucking Ethics.

- Wait. You were happy to take a window seat while others did it.

- That was different !

- I didn't hear any objections when he watched me getting sucked off by that German girl.

That was a first date.

- Refund. - Look, she's too real.

- This is too real.

Nothing is too real.

Yeah, but?

You're standing.

Yeah, I? I just didn't want to be too presumptuous.

I need you on the bed.

Jesus !

(They can't fucking wait.)

Is she going to take that top off ?

If there's no tits.

I want a discount.

They're going to have sex. You're getting the season finale in episode one.

Yeah, but if I don't see her tits?

Will you please be patient ?

Jesus? have some respect.

Hey. Are you ok in there ?

Wow. What is that ?

"Fuck them" is what it is.

A big glass of "fuck them".

Fu? fuck who ?

Always saying what to do, half saying one thing, half saying another.

The talk, the constant talk.

This isn't good.

I'm not getting tits, am I ?

I stopped taking the pills they said I should take, because they dulled the sound.

Always, they've spoken to me, always there, and I've had it.

Oh ok, Harry, I think we should think about wrapping this up.

I was planning on drinking this tonight to make them stop, but I was wavering.

Coward, fucking coward, and then I met you, and it was fate.

You knew what it was like and you said do it.

So now, were saying "fuck it" together.

- What's in the drink ?

- It doesn't matter. Wrap it up.

I know you hear them too.

I saw you talking to them.

No. They're real people, these are real people.

There's no such thing as real people.

Harry, get out of there now !

It's like a club, it's a club, where we meet girls and they talk us through?

- No-one understands me, either.

- No.

All night, they've been watching us and there's this one guy, he's the leader.

He's the leader.

Were the same.

They are watching us.

All night, they've been watching.

They can see you. They can see me.

No-one understands what that's like.

There are a hundred who see through me, standing at their government depots, shouting what to think.

Not any more.

- You too.

- I don't want it.

- It's a state change.

- I don't want it.

It's just a transition and soon, they won't be there and well be free.

Please? Please? I don't want it.

You do.

You do. Sh?

You do.

She murdered him ?

A mercy killing, shed say.

So, when did you find out about this ?

I mean, when did you know that this had happened ?

I saw it on a newscast, I think.

Wipe and destroy everything. Ok ?

Everything.

Now go.

Matthew ?

What's going on ?

What are you doing ?

So Claire? she was my wife.

She's British, you'd like her.

And I'm your wife, in fact.

Claire found out I was involved and took, what you might call a dim view.

She blocked me.

You ever been blocked ?

I've had enough.

Matthew, it's done.

- Stop it. Stop

- Not this time.

It drives you crazy.

Once they hit that button, that's it, you're locked out.

End of conversation.

You can't hear or speak to them.

They can't hear or speak to you.

Every time you look at them, there's just this? anonymous shape.

It usually only lasts for about, like, an hour.

But when they leave it going? oh, shit.

Price of progress, I suppose.

We all got?

We all got Zed-Eyes put in, right.

Which is all fine and dandy until something like this happens and then it's bullshit.

You can't even take them out.

Packet gravy.

How British.

Merry Christmas.

Now were festive. Huh ?

To Christmas !

Anyway, she left me, took custody of Mel.

That's our daughter.

Hence stranding me in this lovely place.

I didn't want to be surrounded by reminders.

What ?

Did you hear that ?

Hear what ?

Well, anyway, I'm glad were talking.

Silence can be oppressive.

You think weird shit in a vacuum, huh ?

I mean, you feel better, right ?

Communicating ?

Talking to me, finally ?

A little bit, maybe. Yeah.

You're a locked box.

I mean, that's a good thing.

Most people are too easy to read, especially if you know minds.

Using party tricks to pick up girls isn't knowing minds.

The picking up girls thing was a hobby.

My job was completely different.

You'll never guess what that was.

Marketing person ?

No.

- Door-to-door salesman ?

- Please.

Proctologist ?

You're never going to get it.

I'm not going to try.

All right. Lets make it a game.

I'll describe to you?

?my day at work, and you stop me when you've guessed it.

The extreme weather has hit sales hard this Christmas.

Five inches of snow?

That's going to wreck my portfolio just when I need it.

Don't know what I'm going to do about that.

Oh, God, more messages.

I'll never clear this inbox.

Sorry. Constant bloody admin.

Just time for a little snack.

I can eat before an operation ?

Wonders of modern science.

Oh, thank God. I'm starving.

That toast looks burnt.

Should I say something ?

Yeah, I think I'll say something.

All good ?

To be honest, it's not quite how

I like it.

It's a bit overdone.

Sorry.

I'll make some more.

She hates me now.

How long is this going to take ?

Hi, I'm Madge.

I'm your anaesthetist today.

Hi.

God, she's young.

Hope she's qualified.

Ok, stop thinking about things that could go wrong.

They said it's straightforward and painless.

I'm just going to relax.

Ok, just relax. Here we go.

Now, just count backwards from ten.

Ten, nine, eight, seven? six, five?

?four, three, two, one.

I can't? I can't see.

Where am I ?

What's that noise ?

Why can't I see ?!

Preparing to extract cookie.

What ? No ! Wait ! I'm still awake !

Oh, my God !

Oh, my God ! What's happening ?

Excuse me ? Oh, my God !

That's me !

That's me ! Oh, my God ! Where am I ?

I don't know what's happening !

I don't know what's happening to me !

Hello ?

Is? is anyone there ?

Hello ?

Ow !

Sorry.

You're probably pretty weirded out right now, I'm guessing.

It's ok, you can talk.

I can hear you through this.

- Hello.

- Hi.

I'm Matthew,

I'm from Smartelligence.

My job is to explain what's happening to you as best I can.

- Oh, my God ! Am I dead ?

- No, no. You're not dead.

No-one's dead here.

How old did you say you were, 30 ?

29. 29, right. So you won't remember

  Xerox machines ?

- Do you know what a photocopier is ?

- What ?

Do you know what a copy is ?

As in a copy of something ?

Of course I know what that is.

Well, that's what you are.

A copy of ?

A copy of you.

- But I am me.

- Ok.

Try to blow on my face.

You can't, because you don't have a body.

Where are your fingers ?

Your arms, your face ? Nowhere.

Because you're code.

You're a simulated brain full of code, stored in this little widget we call a cookie.

Why have you done this to me ?

Ah, well?

Actually you did this to you.

Real you is paying for this.

I don't understand.

You see, what this is, is a service.

We take a blank cookie and we surgically implant it into a clients brain.

It sits there just under the skin for about a week?

?shadowing.

Soaking up the way this particular mind works.

That's why you think you're you.

You are you.

But also not.

Right. Well, it is a lot to process.

Even from inside a processor.

Put me back in my body !

Hm. That's where real you lives.

But?

What we will do though is we will give you a simulated body.

We find that sometimes that helps.

Are you ready ?

- What ? I don't understand !

- Three, and two, one.

Hey.

Better ?

This is my body.

Lets not get into that again.

Look around you.

You've got a control room.

What's this for ?

That console, that's for you to control the house.

I mean, real yous house.

Look. How do you like your toast ?

- What ?

- How do you like your toast ?

- Underdone. Slightly underdone.

- Ok, perfect.

Think about how you like it, then just press the button.

Which one ?

It doesn't matter. You already know you're making toast.

The buttons are symbolic mostly anyway.

See, this is your job now.

You're in charge of everything here.

The temperature, the lighting, what time the alarm clock goes off in the morning.

If there's no food in the refrigerator.

You?

You're in charge of ordering it.

- For who ?

- For real you. She's paying.

Where is real me ?

Taking a nap. In the bedroom.

Top right.

I don't want to be in here.

I don't want to be in here.

I don't want to be in here !

Hey ! Just how you like it.

Ok. Please stop screaming.

Are you going to stop screaming ?

Are you going to stop screaming ?

No. ok.

I'm sorry. I had to mute you.

Oh, sorry.

Look. It'll be much easier if you just comply.

I'm not doing this.

I'm not some sort of push-button toaster monkey.

- Would you prefer to do nothing ?

- Well, I'm not doing this !

Right. Well, nothing it is then.

Let me show you what that is like.

Three weeks sound good ?

That should give you a taste.

What do you mean, three weeks ?

If you just wait for a?

Just?

What about now ?

Please.

Don't do that again.

Please. There's nothing to do here.

There's nothing. There's just?

I mean, there's nothing.

- I did warn you.

- I couldn't even sleep.

You don't need sleep.

Ready to go to work ?

Oh, no, no. No, I'm not.

Definitely not doing that.

- Ok. Well, have six months.

- No. Wait, wait !

See, the trick of it lay in breaking them without letting them snap completely, if you get me.

Too much time in solitary and they'd just wig out.

No use to anyone, then you'd just sell them cheap to the games industry, they'd become? cannon fodder for some war thing.

How are we feeling now ?

Please.

Give me something to do.

Ready to work ?

Yes, please. I'll do anything.

I'll do anything.

Just give me something to do, please.

Ok.

Great toast, by the way.

Hey.

Is it set up ?

You are all set and ready to go.

You know, as I was coming here,

I saw this guy with his shirt off, riding a horse in the middle of the street.

How weird.

I swear to God.

Rossini : The thieving magpie

Good morning, Greta.

Here are today's appointments.

11am - hair with Stelios.

12.30 - Lunch at Barney's Brassiere with Annabel.

3pm - Jackanape Gallery private view, Shoreditch.

6.30 - Christmas drinks with Paolo.

7.30 - The Nutcracker,

Royal Opera House.

That's slavery.

A little melodramatic, isn't it ?

But she thought she was real.

- But she wasn't.

- It's barbaric.

It wasn't really real, so it wasn't really barbaric.

Again, you are not who I expected.

Most people would say,

"She's only made of code, she's not real. Fuck her."

But you're empathetic.

- You care about people.

- Don't you ?

You're a good man.

Am I ?

Based on how you've reacted to what I've said, yeah.

I can tell you're kind?

I'm not a good man.

A good man who's done bad things ?

You can tell me about it.

I've done stuff in my life

I'm not proud of.

I can't pretend I haven't.

Was it something to do with your family ?

Wife ?

Girlfriend ?

It's just us here.

Her dad never liked me.

He never liked me.

It's cold, isn't it ? Come on.

- Beth. Bethany.

- Dad, what now ?

- It gets dark about six.

- We won't be that long !

Hold on. Let me put my glove on.

I think he disapproves.

He's just protective.

He thinks I'm not good enough for you.

Well, I mean, he's got a point.

Let me take a photo of you.

Stand there.

I feel so awkward posing.

Come on. Be a supermodel.

- This awkward enough for you ?

- It's perfect.

Right. Ready ?

That's nice. Hold it there.

You're such a dick.

Los Bravos : Black is black

Black is black

I want my baby back

It's Grey, it's Grey

Since you went away

Oh, oh? 

We were good together, you know.

We were really good together.

Whoo !

You can blame me

Try to shame me

And still I'll care for you

You can run around

Even put me down

And still I'll be there for you.

Yeah !

What you doing round there ?

Why are you all around there ?

- No. No, were going home. Come on.

- Don't manhandle me.

I'm not going to get up if you all touch me.

I'm not going to get up.

I'm not going to get up.

It's cool. It's cool.

- Come on, Joe.

- Come on.

Cheers, mate.

Things weren't perfection.

These things never are, but?

?we were really happy.

I'll let Gita tell the story.

She loves boring people with our personal details.

I'd been working there for about a fortnight when Beth introduced the two of us, and ta-da !

So it's all Beth's doing.

She's the puppet-master.

What was her tip for winning me over again ?

Not to let you hear me snore.

We all went on this work trip once, before Gita's time.

I fell asleep on the coach back and snored so loud they all thought there was something wrong with me.

He snores like a bison.

Wow.

Really, you're telling him that ?

Oh, another one bites the dust.

I think she's more into him than he's into her.

Don't you think ?

- Is that one finished ?

- Mmm-hmm.

- Yeah ?

You all right ?

- I'm tired.

- You've been a bit quiet.

Just wasn't in the mood, you know ?

I see them all the time at work.

I think I'm going to go to bed.

Do you mind ?

No, that's fine.

Beth ?

What ?

Is this yours ?

I just found it in the bin.

That means pregnant.

Is it yours ?

Yes.

I mean, that?

Christ.

That's amazing, I mean?

It's just?

Joe, I can't.

A baby, a pregnancy? not now.

Not right now, I can't.

Of course you can.

My God, you'll be an amazing mum.

- No. I'm 27, I'm not ready.

- Who's ever ready ?

It s not? it's just too quick, ok ?

It's all too quick.

Well manage.

I'll surprise you.

You're not listening.

- I can be pretty responsible when pushed.

- Joe.

You can put your feet up,

I'll do shoulder rubs,

- I'll paint the house?

- Joe, please.

- Well be like a couple in a DIY ad?

- Joe.

- Well be like a family.

- I don't want it.

- But it's a baby.

- Joe.

I mean, it's our baby.

I know, and it's not easy for me.

- Well, lets at least discuss this.

- No. I've made up my mind.

Well, I haven't.

God, look at you.

You're pissed.

You drank all night, Beth.

You drank all night.

Jesus Christ, you're pregnant.

Yeah, well, I don't want to be.

And I'm not going to be.

- You're being a bitch.

- Stop it.

- You're being a cold bitch who would kill a kid.

- That's not fair.

Who'd get it torn out because it doesn't suit her plans.

Stop or I'll block you.

Don't you dare.

No. We can talk tomorrow, just please stop.

Don't you fucking dare.

Beth !

Turn it off.

Turn it off, you?

Turn it off, Beth !

Listen to me, Beth.

Turn it off.

You turn it off !

Turn it off.

You turn it off, Beth !

Beth ?

Turn it? off ! Please.

Turn it off.

Beth ?

Wait !

I'm sorry, I was pissed.

Can we just talk about this properly, please ?

I've said some really awful shit.

Beth, I love you.

Listen, we can work this out.

No, Beth?

Beth, please !

Beth !

That day, I didn't go to work.

I just stayed at home and?

?tried to work out how to make amends.

But she just didn't come back.

And thanks to the block,

I couldn't?

I couldn't message her.

I couldn't call her.

After a week, I was pretty desperate.

So I just hung around outside her work, like a stalker.

Tim ! Gita !

Have you seen Beth ?

She left.

Left. What, like? ?

Handed in her notice.

No-one knows where she is.

Joe ?

- Joe !

- No, leave him.

I was still hopeful that she would get in touch, or at least remove the block so that I could contact her.

But no.

When there's a block, you can't even wallow properly.

You can't switch it off.

You can't take the Zed-Eyes out.

And it doesn't just block them, it blocks every image of them.

So every memory

I had of her was vandalised.

And then one day

I'm out in town and?

?it was her.

She was pregnant.

Shed kept it.

Well, I just sort of lost it.

I just ran over and started pleading with her. Just pleading.

Turn it off. Turn it off.

Just turn it off.

Turn it off. Beth, turn it off.

Help. Get off me !

Some passer-by called the police.

They took me down the station.

And that was that.

So, by now, the blocks got legal backing.

And there's a GPS so that if I go within ten metres of her, bang - I get arrested.

Harsh.

Yeah, and I've got no idea where she is.

If?

Whether she's had the baby or not.

Whether it's a boy or a girl.

If it's ok.

I've got absolutely no way of getting in touch with her.

Except I knew where her dad lived.

So I write her a letter, this begging letter.

Laying it all out, you know, and I get no response.

So I write again?

?and again?

?and again.

No response.

She cut you out good.

But there was one thing I could do.

I knew she spent every Christmas with him at his place, so I knew that she would definitely be there.

So, the day before,

Christmas Eve, I headed up.

And where her dad lived was this isolated place in the back of beyond.

I'd never been up there without her.

It was weird being on the outside.

I waited there all day. Until?

Well, I had to take a closer look.

And there's her dad with our baby, but I can't even see its face because?

Legal blocks cover offspring too.

Been there.

That hurts.

I couldn't even tell if it was a boy or a girl.

I know this sounds stupid?

?but seeing something?

?was better than nothing.

So I kept going back.

It became an annual pilgrimage.

Once a year I'd head up there and watch them from a distance.

Watching the kid grow up, you know ?

More than anything I just wanted to make some sort of contact.

Anything.

So, one Christmas, kid must have been about four by now, I headed up there and I took a little present with me.

Just a small, stupid thing.

For the first time,

I could see she was a girl.

I had a daughter.

So, Santa Claus?

?did you try it again next year ?

Something happened before then.

It had been a few months since I'd been up there to?

?look at my daughter.

I was just sat at home watching TV, flipping through the channels.

?which claimed the lives of 26 people on a quiet Wednesday morning.

Passengers like Palab Ghatak, just 18, on his way to his first job interview, and Bethany Grey, a young mother who'd only recently started?

It had been so long since I'd seen her, it was hard to imagine anything but that shadow in her place.

But now that the block had died with her?

?there she was.

She was gone.

Sorry.

But there was one silver lining?

With the block gone.

You'd get to see your daughter.

It was almost Christmas, so I bought her this snow globe -

Just a present to give her.

And I headed up to Beth's dads.

And there she was.

Not a silhouette.

Real.

Hello, darling.

The world

May think I'm foolish

They can't see you

Like I can

Oh, but anyone

Who knows what love is

Will understand.

What is it, May ?

Would you like a drink ?

What are you doing here ?

Beth's dead.

Do you understand ?

She's dead.

There's nothing for you here.

Where's my daughter ?

What daughter ?

This is Beth's daughter.

I want to see my daughter.

May, go upstairs.

If this is about those letters?

?I threw them out before she saw them.

She was a mess, shed had to leave everything behind.

I want to see my daughter.

I think you should go.

Get out of this house.

I want to see my daughter.

You have no daughter here !

? A great big smile on somebody's face 

If you jump into your bed

Quickly cover up your head

Don't you lock the doors

You know that sweet Santa Claus is on the way 

Well, I wish it could be

Christmas every day? 

It was that clock.

It was that clock.

Then what happened ?

Tell me.

I just left.

When you're skating in the park

If the snow cloud makes it dark

Then your rosy cheeks are gonna light my merry way 

Now the frosty paws appear?

I got in the car and I just drove.

Anywhere. I don't know where.

I walked into the nearest town and I?

I slept on the street and I drank.

And then after a while, I don't know how long, a couple of months, they picked me up.

They wanted me to talk but I couldn't talk?

?because if I said it, it would be real.

So I didn't say anything,

I didn't tell them.

And what about the girl ?

What happened to the girl ?

I only know what they said.

What did they say ?

- What did they say ?

- What is this place ?

- What did they say ?

- What do we do here ?

Our job. The job.

Joe, stay with me.

What did they say ?

What did they say, Joe ?

That she just? she just stayed in the house.

It was, um?

It was Christmas Eve, so she just?

?she just stayed hidden.

She didn't move.

Then on Boxing Day she realised that no-one was going to help.

And she gave her grandad a present that she'd made.

And she went out to go and get help.

How far did she get ?

Oh, may God forgive me.

God forgive me.

So you confess ?

Joe ?

Just say it.

Just let it out.

I confess.

I confess.

Whoo ! I knew I could do it.

Boom ! I told you I'd get it.

All right, I'm coming out.

Sorry, Joe.

Well ? That had to be enough?

Full confession. Clear conviction.

Well done.

Two days we pressed him and he said piss all, this bastard cracks him in 70 minutes.

He knows he's guilty, he needed to unload.

It wasn't really 70 minutes, not to him.

When he was first ingested,

I tweaked the time preferences, made it seam like five years from his perspective.

Some might say that five years with me is punishment enough.

Wait here.

Mr Potter.

Congratulations on your confession.

That cookie we took out of your head just gave us the full story.

So you can keep the silent act up as long as you want.

Makes no difference - you've already talked.

Also, Merry Christmas.

So?

The deal ?

Break a confession from him and I go free, right ?

I'm the expert, you needed me?

That's one for the Home Office.

Well make good on the offer.

You're free to go, Mr Trent.

With some caveats.

- Caveats ?

- You'll be on the register.

What register ?

The one for Peeping Tom pervs.

All I did was help some lonely guys by providing a service.

An illegal service.

You also failed to report a murder - fatal poisoning, in case you've forgotten.

Kept that information from your

Cookie Monster mate, didn't you ?

What does it mean, this register ?

- It means you're blocked.

- By who ?

By everyone.

Hot chestnuts !

Wizzard : I wish it could be

Christmas everyday

Are you ready, children ?

When the?

Hey, come on.

Just changing the time settings.

Cranked him up to 1,000 years a minute.

There's a proper sentence.

Or do you want me to switch him off ?

No. Leave him on for Christmas.

Oh, I wish it could be Christmas every day 

Let the bells ring out

For Christmas?

When the snowman brings the snow

When the snowman brings the snow 

Well, he just might like to know

He just might like to know 

He's put a great big smile?

Aaaarrrgh !

So if Santa brings that sleigh? 

Argh ! Aaaargh !

Along the milky way

Along the milky way 

I'll sign my name on the rooftop in the snow 

Then he may decide to stay

Well, I wish it could be

Christmas every day 

When the kids start singing and the band begins to play 

Oh-oh-oh, I wish it could be

Christmas every day 

So let the bells ring out for Christmas. 

Ok, you lot, take it !

Oh, I wish it could be

Christmas every day 

Christmas bells

When the kids start singing and the band begins to play 

Oh-oh-oh

I wish it could be

Christmas every day 

Let the bells ring out for Christmas 

Why don't you give your love

For Christmas ?



# Season 3



## 1. Nosedive



- Hey, Lacie!

- Hey!

Ryan?

Ryan!

- I was holding a bomb!

- Come on!

Sorry, guys.

Landlord is sending buyers over today so... put your pants on.

Maybe if I don't, it'll scare 'em off and we can stay here.

Not an option, Ryan.

Lease is up in four weeks.

Hey, I'm thinking of you.

I've got somewhere to go.

Nate's roommate took a job in

Phoenix so I get his place.

- Okay.

- Now who's the slow poke?

I'm... seeing some places over lunch. Catch you later.

Sorry, that was my sister.

Yeah. Yeah, I bet you'd love to.

Jasmine tea?

And that's one Brushed Suede.

You want a cookie with that?

- It's on the house.

- Sounds awesome.

- See you tomorrow, JJ.

- See you, Lacie.

Oh, I saw your boy in the fire hat just now! So cute!

Yeah, he's really something.

Hmm.

Hey, Lacie!

- Bets, it's great to see you!

- You too.

How's Pancakes?

He's hilarious. Such a funny cat. Just the best.

- Are you still at Hoddicker?

- Mm-hmm.

- Yeah. It's going pretty great.

- Good to hear.

- So what brings you back here?

- New job, first day.

- First day?

- At Blankman-Harper.

Whoa! Top floor! That's...

- Well, good luck.

- I know, right?

It's great you're still happy at Hoddicker.

- Well, maybe not forever.

- No, not forever.

- But for now...

- It's OK for now.

It's great for now, yes. Yes, it is.

Lacie, I got you a smoothie.

Got one for everyone, actually.

Still a bunch of them for grabs.

They're from the organic stall at the farmers' market.

Sure. Okay.

Mmm!

Thank you. Thank you.

We're kind of not talking to Ches.

- 3.1? What happened?

- Him and Gordon split up.

Oh...

- Poor Ches.

- No, no, no, we're all on Gordon's side.

Sure! Obviously.

Ches is kissing ass.

Trying to scrape himself back.

Of course, if it drops below two-five, then it's... bye-bye.

\_

Hello?

- Yo, they're taking it.

- Who?

The couple the landlord sent over.

I heard them talking.

Okay.

So, now we move into the light space area.

Ideal for special times with loved ones.

- Great food, great company.

- Mm-hmm!

Whoa!

Sampled your photo stream to make her.

Great hair!

Styled free of charge at the members' salon.

Oh, my God.

It's hilarious!

You like him?

- He's okay.

- He doesn't come with the apartment.

But there is a bar and restaurant on site, tenants only.

We have unparalleled metrics on romantic geneses.

Uh-huh.

I gotta say, these places are going like "that."

- So don't delay if you're interested.

- Oh, I'm more than interested.

Standard occupancy on a minimum six-month contract, we're talking... this much.

- How often are the payments?

- That's weekly.

Okay.

- A little more than expected?

- Yeah.

There's options.

You know our Prime Influencers Programme?

- Do I qualify for that?

- No. No, you don't.

We'd need you around a 4.5.

4.5?

Hit 4.5 and there's a 20% discount.

- 4.5.

- That's right.

Pelican Cove? What is this?

A eugenics programme?

- A lifestyle community.

- No one is this happy.

A two-year-old with a fucking balloon isn't this happy.

It's actually a pretty cool place.

Like you'd even qualify.

There's nothing I can do, sir.

Well, it's not hopeless, you're clearly a tryer.

That's the sense you get just from... me?

From your rep report analytics.

If we drill down into the numbers, you've got a solid popularity arc here.

Strong overall trajectory.

Let's just look at the last 24 hours.

You see, even...

What's that? 8:40 a.m. You're working hard on your socials.

- Great little uptake there.

- Okay.

Couple of minor dings there.

You cut someone off in traffic?

Oh, just a workplace thing.

Okay. Let's check on your sphere of influence.

Let me zoom out here.

Great peripherals.

Strangers like you, that's a plus.

- Healthy inner circle. It's good.

- Thank you.

There's a ways to go, but 4.5 is certainly achievable.

How long do you think?

- To hit 4.5?

- Mm-hmm.

Well, barring a major setback, a public disgrace kind of deal,

I'd say 18 months or so.

Oh, I need more short term.

Like... much more.

Then you'll need a boost.

- What kind of a boost?

- Well...

Most of your interactions are confined to your inner circle and they're largely, pardon the term, mid-to low-range folks.

Same with your outer circle.

You've got a ton of reciprocal five stars from service industry workers, but there's not much else.

At least as far as I can see.

So in terms of quality, you could use a punch up right there.

Ideally, that's up votes from quality people.

- Quality people?

- High fours.

Impress those up-scale folks, you'll gain velocity on your arc and there's your boost.

- Oh, hi, JJ!

- Hey, Lacie!

- Keith! Hello.

- Lacie!

- You look great today.

- Thank you!

- Door won't open. I'm on 2.4.

- Sorry, Ches. I'm late.

I just need some stars, please!

Fuck!

- Oh, hi!

- Hi!

- How's it going at Blankman?

- Just great.

- Well, I bet you work... good there.

- Thank you.

Would you like a croissant?

They gave me an extra at the coffee place.

- Oh, no, I already ate.

- Okay, sure. All good. Yes.

Yeah.

Well, here's me, so...

Don't try too hard.

It's impossible to respect.

High fours can smell it a mile off. Just be you.

Authentic gestures, that's the key.

- That's time up, I'll catch you later.

- Oh, could I just ask...

... "Mr. Rags."

\_

\_

Shit!

- What the fuck is that?

- Tapenade. Want some?

Who even are you?

It's just something I wanna eat, Ryan.

Oh, my God.

- What is it?

- Naomi!

Shit!

Old school, el perfecto Naomi?

You guys keep in contact?

Ryan, just go! Go!

Oh, my God!

Nay-Nay, how are you?

I was just fixing myself a snack.

Oh, Lace, could I just say I am so happy to see your face?

- Me too. It's been...

- Too long.

- Way too long.

- And that's my fault.

- No, it's mine. Everything is just so...

- Everything's just so...

Crazy! Oh, it's so good to see you.

When you posted that

Mr. Rags photo...

I know, Mr. Rags!

I just had to call and talk to you because...

Whoo-hoo!

Wow! That's a... big ring!

Congratulations! Who's the, um... Paul?

He is great. So smart. Just sweet.

I know you're gonna love him.

Uh-huh.

So, anyways, the big day...

Yes, when is it?

So, we're getting married in a month on his family's estate up here on the island.

This place outside Port Mary,

Honeysuckle. You heard of it?

No, but...

Well, it's a private island.

Take a looooook!

Oh, wow! That is...

I know, right? So... can you make it?

Are you kidding? Of course.

Great, cool, cos I was wondering if...

Lace, do you think...

Would you be my maid of honour?

Seriously?

Oh, my God.

I mean, you've got such cool friends now. Are you sure?

Remember when we used to plan our dream weddings when we were, like, 11?

- I know but we haven't s...

- I don't know, just seeing Mr. Rags...

All the memories.

It just brought things home.

Oh, Nay-Nay.

I know we haven't kept in touch as much as I'd have liked and that is totally my fault, but this is a big day.

A big life day and I want my oldest friend with me, my oldest friend.

I want you by my side.

Oh, my God. Thank you.

What do I have to...

Not much to it. A speech, mainly.

Speech? Of course!

Mm-hmm. How big's the crowd?

Oh, my gosh, like... hundreds!

It's a crazy guest list. I'll send it now.

Paul's invited so many,

I don't want to call them big deals, but they're all, like, 4.7 or above.

Uh-huh.

Nay-Nay, I will not let you down.

Don't sweat too much!

Just talk about old memories.

- Sure.

- How we were, any old things.

- Gotcha.

- I'll ping you some anecdotes.

- That would be great.

- And what's your dress size?

Oh, um...

I'll tell you what,

I'll just send you a four.

- Perfect.

- We got matching bridesmaids dresses.

Well, anyway...

Love you, Lay.

You too, Nay-Nay!

Oh!

Bye.

What was that? The F-word?

You two pussy pals now?

Shut up.

- She was always mean to you.

- No, she wasn't.

- She had that rhyme about you.

- That was a game.

- What about when she cut your hair?

- I asked her to.

She fucked Greg.

She... did not fuck Greg.

She looked hot. I'll give her that.

Okay.

Impressive.

- Uh-huh. Jesus. Yeah, that'd do it.

- Mm-hmm.

Pelican Cove.

Carole, it's Lacie. Saw the place yesterday. I wanna take it.

That's fantastic!

Uh... Oh, I see you're still on a 4.2. Is that, um...

Yep, I'm on it, just gonna transfer the deposit now.

- Well, okay.

- Yes!

In this world, we're all so caught up in our own heads.

It's easy to lose sight of what's real. What matters.

But as I stand here today... seeing the joy Paul has brought to Naomi's life,

I know she's someone who truly matters to me.

Nay-Nay, the little girl who, when we were just five-years-old in art camp, started talking to me because she saw I was scared.

The girl who helped me make

Mr. Rags. I still have him.

He sits on my desk and... every day, he reminds me of Nay-Nay.

What she meant to me then and now.

I am so honored to be here and I wish you all the happiness this stupid world can muster.

I love you, Nay-Nay.

Is the tear too much?

You fucking sociopath.

- Ryan, my car's here. Was it too much?

- What, the tear, the photo, Mr. Rags?

I do keep him on my desk.

There's sugary and then there's fucking diabetes.

I just wanna make her happy on her wedding day.

The captive audience of 4-point holies five-starring your ass off, that's just a bonus.

- Naomi and I were best friends.

- Come on...

I wish her well and wanna express it the best I can.

And, yeah, if I nail a speech and get five-starred by hundreds of primes, so what?

It's a win-win.

What are you hoping for? Like, 4.3, 4.4?

Unh-unh. You get points from your gaming buddies.

It's the same thing.

Don't shit on me for aiming higher.

Pelican Cove higher?

What's wrong with Pelican Cove?

They're great apartments!

They are fake-smile jail cells.

Great. Car cancelled.

And he marked me down so now I have to book another, and I took a ding.

- Great job.

- I am sorry, but I miss the normal you.

Before this obsession, when we had conversations, remember?

I need my charger.

This whole ranking thing, just comparing yourself to people who...

- Have you seen my charger?

- ...only pretend to be happy.

I said don't borrow this!

High fours like Naomi,

I bet they're suicidal on the inside.

My car is here. Again.

Your Pelican Cove deposit, is it refundable?

Like, what if this doesn't work?

- Can't you just stay out of my shit?

- You're my sister!

Yes! And if you cared about that, maybe you would've noticed living with you hasn't been one big rainbow sandwich for me.

Do you know why I never brought any guys back here?

Because I didn't want them to know

I was sharing a skanky-ass cave with Mr. Three Point Fuck.

Good luck with your performance!

Oh, hi, hi! I'm coming. I'm coming.

- Jesus Christ!

- Oh, I'm so sorry.

That's great. Just great.

Oh... Hi.

Nay-Nay!

Hey, Lace! Just checking in.

I'm on my way to the airport right now.

Okay, cool, and you're all good for the rehearsal dinner?

Oh, yeah. The flight's, what, an hour?

That restaurant looks so cool.

- Uh-huh. And you got the dress okay?

- Mm-hmm. In my case.

- I love the pink.

- Uh-huh.

So the latest draft of the speech is great.

Going handwritten's so cool.

Those scans of the page, my God,

I welled up just at that.

- Oh, thank you!

- Um... just one thought.

That whole bit where I help you with the eating disorder thing...

- You think that's a little...

- A little over-sharing, yeah.

You're so right. It's gone.

Okay. Cool. Well, I'll see you in a few hours!

_ I'm getting married tomorrow _

- And here's your tip.

- Thank you.

Oh, come on.

May I have your attention, please...

- Hi there, how are you doing?

- I am wonderful.

I am so sorry, that flight is cancelled.

- No. No, no, no.

- Customer incident at the other end.

But... So when is the next flight?

Yeah, they're all kind of full.

Uh... I booked this weeks ago.

It's my best friend's wedding.

- I'm sorry.

- I have to get there. I have to.

Okay... let's see what we can do.

Thank you. Thank you so much.

I see there's one standby seat on another plane leaving tonight.

Uh...

That's reserved for members of our Prime Flight Programme.

You gotta be a 4.2 or over to qualify.

- Oh, I'm... I'm a 4.2.

- Uh-huh.

I'm afraid you're actually a 4.183.

Oh. Well, that's not my fault. Um...

Some woman dinged me down in the... Can't you just...

I'm sorry, it won't let me book it without the correct ranking.

- But it's so close.

- There's just nothing I can do.

- Christ, I mean, surely.

- I'm gonna have to ask you to moderate your language there.

Sorry. It's just...

I'm maid of honour.

I cannot miss this wedding.

And I am so sorry about that.

- Can you call the supervisor?

- I cannot do that.

- Can you just call the supervisor?

- I cannot do that.

- Call the fucking supervisor!

- Okay, that's profanity.

- We're zero tolerance on profanity.

- I'm sorry. It's just...

- I have to serve the next customer.

- No, no, no, no.

- Can you step away, ma'am?

- God, just fucking help me!

Ooh.

I'm so sorry.

- I've called security.

- Oh, no, no, no. Please don't do that.

I'm, uh... five-starring you. Five stars.

- What's the issue here, Hannah?

- Intimidation and profanity.

- Oh, no, no. I was not intimidating.

- Don't speak, ma'am.

- I was just trying to...

- Ma'am.

Okay. So, in order to restore calm,

I'm invoking my authority as airport security to dock you one full ranking point as a punitive measure.

- This is a temporary measure.

- No!

Your score reverts to normal in 24 hours.

No, no, no. But I need it now.

During this period, all down votes are subject to a times two multiplier.

Times two?

We recommend you avoid negative feedback at this time.

I'm on double damage?

Please, remove yourself from the airport immediately.

Okay, well, due to your ranking...

Hi there. Chuck! Great name.

- Thank you.

- Hope you're having a great night.

- It's pretty good.

- So I need a car.

- You got a vehicle in mind?

- Anything, really.

Well, due to your current ranking, you're restricted to our super saver fleet.

- Yep. That's... Yeah.

- I-Cruiser 2?

They still have the 2?

Oh, God.

Oh, come on.

Uh...

Damn it!

The little girl, who when we were both five years old in art camp, started talking to me because she saw I was scared.

The girl who helped me make Mr. Rags...

Teardrop. Crowd goes wild. You can do this.

- Sorry, okay, I swear I'm on my way.

- How far away are you?

Uh... Quite a ways. I missed my flight.

- What?

- Well, not missed it but...

So you're not gonna make the rehearsal dinner?

- No.

- Lacie!

I am so sorry. It's been...

I got a rental car. I'm driving.

Driving? That's like nine hours.

I'm making good time, gonna go through the night, make a road trip out of it.

Is everything okay?

I can find a replacement if something's wrong.

No. No. No. I'll be there.

I swear on Mr. Rags.

Ha ha ha!

Okay, just drive safe!

You bet. I'll just...

Come on.

Come on.

Please.

Okay.

What do you want?

Oh, shit.

Hi. Sorry.

Your charger doesn't fit my car.

- Don't see those around much these days.

- It's a rental.

Ours chargers are Q2Z, yours one's a K1.

They didn't give you an adapter?

No. Do you have one?

- Not in here. Ask around.

- Thanks, anyway.

You're super helpful.

Two stars?!

Two stars?

Wasn't a meaningful encounter.

Sir, excuse me.

Excuse me, sorry.

Do you have a K1 adapter, by any chance?

Ma'am, how about you, a K1 adapter, perhaps, in the trunk of your car?

Sure.

Great.

Oh, ma'am, hi. Do you have a K1 adapter?

I have a rental car. It's...

- Slow down. Let's give her a ride.

- She's, like, 2.8.

Come on!

I didn't even do anything!

You look like you need a ride.

Um...

Actually, I'm okay.

Don't look it. Come on. I don't bite.

Luther, Mrs. Coffee, reds, whiskey. Help yourself.

I'm okay. Thanks.

Where are you headed?

Uh... Just as close as you can get to Port Mary would be great.

Checking my feed for danger signs?

I get it a lot. 1.4 gotta be an antisocial maniac, right?

- You seem...

- Normal?

- Yeah.

- Thank you.

It took some effort.

What happened to you?

I mean, you're a 2.8, but you don't look 2.8.

That's not... This is temporary.

- I'm gonna turn it around.

- Uh-huh.

- I'm going to a wedding. Maid of honour.

- Nice.

Wanna hear my speech?

No.

So how come you're a 2.8?

Well, I got marked down at the airport for yelling, and they put me on double damage.

- How did it feel?

- Awful.

I meant the yelling.

I don't know. I was mad.

Look at where it got me.

But as long as I get to the wedding, do the speech, they'll overlook the

2.8. I'm with the bride.

And if I do well, well, they're all high fours so that velocitates my arc.

And once they lift the point penalty, well, my average goes way up, and, yeah, it's gonna be okay.

God, you remind me of me.

- Hmm.

- Not now.

I was, uh... 4.6 once.

- 4.6?

- Used to live for it.

All the work I put in...

Eight years ago, Tom, my husband, got cancer.

It was pancreatic. It was a real bitch.

The symptoms showed up late.

I'm so sorry.

You don't know me so you're not really sorry.

You're just mainly awkward cos I have sprung some cancer talk at you.

Anyway, I five-starred every doctor, every nurse, every high-four consultant that we had.

Ding. Ding. Ding. Thank you so much.

The cancer didn't give a shit.

It just kept growing.

A couple of months in, we heard about this experimental treatment.

It was very expensive.

It was very exclusive.

I did everything I could to get him a spot there.

Tom was a 4.3.

They gave his bed to a 4.4.

So when he died I thought, fuck it.

I started saying what I wanted, when I wanted.

Just drop it out there.

People don't always like that.

It is incredible how fast you slip off the ladder when you start doing that.

It turned out a lot of my friends didn't care for honesty.

Treated me like I had taken a shit at their breakfast table.

But, Jesus Christ, it felt good.

Shedding those fuckers.

It was like taking off tight shoes.

- Maybe you should try it?

- Oh, come on.

Why not?

I can't just kick off my shoes and walk the earth or whatever.

- You won't know unless you try.

- Oh, that's just...

Look, you had something with your life, real things, good things, and you lost it all, and I'm sorry.

So now you've got nothing left to lose.

But I don't even have the something worth losing, not yet.

You know, I mean,

I'm still fighting for that.

- And what is "that"?

- I don't know. Enough to be content?

Like, to look around and think, well, I guess I'm okay.

Just to be able to breathe out, not feeling like... like...

Like just... And that is way off, like, way, way off.

And until I get there, I have to play the numbers game.

We all do, that's what we're in.

That's how the fucking world works.

Look, maybe you don't remember, you know, you're just too old to get it.

I do not mean that how it sounds.

Don't worry. I'm not voting you down.

- Sweetheart.

- What time is it?

I'm heading east from here so I think you need to get yourself another ride.

- Where are we?

- About 30 miles from Port Mary.

A lot of buses stop here so you should be fine.

- Well, thank you.

- Good luck with your speech.

I put a little something in there for you.

- You did?

- Emergency escape hatch!

Bye.

In this world, we're all so caught up...

...in our own dramas.

- So, Dad was like...

- It's easy to forget what matters.

He'd never even heard of the show.

I'm like, "You never heard of

Sea of Tranquillity?"

Like, the number-one sci-fi fantasy, and he's all like,

"What the fuck?" Whatever!

I think I'm allergic to this purple.

So I'm like, "Well, I'm going to Tranquillity Con in Port Mary.

That's why I'm dressed like Lieutenant Duster."

He's all like, "Uh...

Port Mary is frickin' miles away."

Yadda, yadda, yadda.

He one-stars me. Like, thanks, Dad.

- See you back on there.

- Okay.

Are you guys headed to Tranquillity Con?

- You're into Sea of Tranquillity?

- Totally.

I was all set to go.

My friend, who is there already, has my costume, but my car broke down.

Well, there's some space in the RV.

- Hi.

- Hey!

- You're a Trank head, huh?

- Sorry?

Trank head. Sea of Tranquillity fan?

Oh, yeah. We say Tranksters where I'm from.

- Who's your favourite character?

- Gotta be Lieutenant Duster.

- She's awesome.

- She?

He! I misspoke.

Lieutenant Duster has no fixed gender.

I know, and that's why it's so hard to remember, right?

Excuse me. Gotta get this.

My friend, at the convention.

Hi, Nay!

So, oh, my God, insane night, but I am so close now.

Don't come.

What? No. No. I'm, like, an hour away.

Don't come. I don't want you here.

I don't know what is up with you, but I cannot have a 2.6 at my wedding.

Oh, no, that's temporary!

That's temporary.

Well, the wedding's today so...

- But it doesn't change anything.

- Lacie...

- I can still do the same speech.

- Lacie...

- And there's Mr. Rags!

- No!

But... But you invited me.

You've seen the guest list.

They are all, like, 4.5 or above.

They are going to freak at a 2.6, and I am not taking that kind of damage, plus I haven't dipped under a 4.7 in, like, six months.

You said you wanted your oldest friend.

When I asked you to speak, you were a 4.2, okay?

And the authenticity of a vintage bond low four at a gathering of this calibre played fantastically on all the stimulations we ran.

Forecast was a prestige bounce of 2 minimum.

But now you're a sub three. Sorry.

That just puts the stink on things a little too much.

That just plays badly for us.

So it was just about numbers for you?

Oh, cut the shit! It was numbers for both of us.

You wanted those primo votes, don't deny it.

It's not like you could get them on your own. Let's not kid ourselves.

Oh, I'm... I'm getting those votes.

What? You're just gonna roll up here and make people like you?

- That's right. I'm doing my speech.

- No, you're not.

Yes, I am. And they are gonna vote me through the roof when they hear it.

- Weep their fucking eyes out!

- Go home!

Hello?

Fuck!

I have never seen your stupid fucking show.

Hope they cancel it!

I need a ride!

Fuck!

Jesus!

Hey! Hey!

Hey!

- Can I borrow your bike?

- What?

Can I borrow your bike?

Do you, Naomi Jayne Blestow, take this man to be your husband, to live together with him in the covenant of marriage?

To love him, comfort him, honour and keep him, in sickness and in health... and forsaking all others, be faithful unto him...

To my best mate, Anthony.

Let's hear it for him.

You've been there from day one.

I love you, man. I appreciate you.

Hilarious speech, by the way.

By your standards.

- Pow! Pow! Pow!

- Oh! Oh! Oh!

He's still got a few bullets left. Oh, man.

Oh, gosh, well, um...

Shit!

We have so many people to thank.

Our beautiful bridesmaids.

But, of course, my most heartfelt thanks, my warmest thanks, are to someone who's my best friend, my lover and now,

I'm honoured to say, my wife.

Naomi!

One, two, three! Naomi!

The A Team!

I love you so much, darl.

Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!

Congratulations, sir.

- Thank you.

- No, thank you.

Get over here!

Get your ass over here.

Get in here, big boy.

You're beautiful!

Yeah! Gimme five! Good choice!

You fucking earned it, man.

You fucking earned it.

Everybody, hello!

- Oh, my God.

- I love you.

Can everyone be quiet for a moment?

Thank you.

- Get rid of her.

- That would play awful.

She's a fucking 1.1.

Now for those of you who don't know me, which is... all of you... my name is Lacie Pound and, believe it or not,

I am one of Naomi's oldest friends.

Hi, Nay-Nay!

It's great to meet you too, Paul.

I've heard a lot about you.

He's a pretty big deal, that Paul.

Pretty big deal.

He makes his own tapenade! Yeah.

Uh...

Anyway, um... I... have looked up to Naomi pretty much my entire life.

We met when we were five years old, and right up through to our teenage years, we made quite the pair.

We'd talk about all the things girls talk about, you know, boys, hair, products, uh... more boys.

I mean, I tried sometimes to expand our range a little and talk about climate change, but she found that kind of boring so...

Go on.

She was probably right.

I mean, fuck the planet, right?

Whoo!

Yes, thank you! Come on.

Let's have a little fun here.

You know, fuck the planet!

Fuck the planet!

Anyway...

I... looked up to Naomi pretty much my entire life, which meant she was looking down on me.

Always with a smile though.

In high school, she was my shoulder to cry on.

She seemed to enjoy that.

Guys and me never worked out.

They'd see Naomi and just... Whoo!

You know, that was it.

She had this tight ass, like two fists.

Uh-huh.

I was all like...

I was like... through the hallways in high school.

And she was there for me.

Holding my hair back... as I knelt, vomiting, in front of the crapper.

Thank you for that, Naomi.

I always wished I was you.

And...

I guess that's why you kept me around so long?

Until you got your new job and your fancy new friends.

And that...

...fucking... jackhole!

And you didn't need me.

You probably got another me.

Guess there's some other "yeth Beth" you moved on to like a succubus.

I'm getting to Mr. Rags, okay? Jesus!

Stay back.

Stay the fuck back! I'll kill him!

I'll cut his head off and stick it up my ass!

Time's nearly up!

- Hey! Calm down.

- I...

I just wanted to say, in this world so caught up in our own shit,

- let's not forget what matters.

- It's okay. It's okay.

Happiness, fucking Paul and Naomi, and she's...

She... She fucked Greg!

I know she did.

- I know you did.

- No...

Don't even try to deny...

The little girl who, when we were just five-years-old in art camp, started talking to me because she saw I was scared and helped me make Mr. Rags.

He reminds me of you and what you meant to me then!

And I'm so honoured to be here to see this shit!

I love you, Nay-Nay!

I've always loved you!

I love you!

What the fuck are you looking at?

Just what I was wondering.

Well...

Don't!

Don't? Don't wonder?

Uh-huh.

It would be a dull world without wonder.

I don't give a shit about your world.

I don't like your brassiere.

I don't like your moustache.

I don't like your aura.

- My aura?

- Yeah.

I don't like your... head.

Your entire head is just ridiculous to me.

Really?

You look like an alcoholic former weatherman.

You sound like a lost little lamb that just got told there's no Santa Claus.

What sort of cartoon character did your mum have to fuck to brew you up in the womb?

At least I look like I was born, not shit out by some tormented cow creature in an underground lab.

You got tossed out of that lab.

- Oh, yeah?

- Oh, yeah, flushed out.

- Ooh!

- In the trash!

- Your face is a fucking...

- Fucking.

Fucking biological car crash that made Picasso screw his eyes up and say,

"Well, that just don't make sense."

- You're a fucking asshole.

- Fuck you!

- Fuck you next Wednesday.

- Fuck you for Christmas!

- Fuck you!

- Fuck you!



## 2. Playtest



[glass cracks]

[exhales]

[closes door quietly]

[birds tweet]

[phone vibrates]

[rattling]

[banging]

[helicopter whirrs]

[roars]

[tone sounds]

I'm gonna have to ask you to switch that off for now.

Okay, thanks.

[rattling continues]

You know what it's kinda like?

It's kinda like a rollercoaster.

You know what I mean?

It's like a roller coaster.

- [banging]

- [giggles]

Try it, try it with me.

How tall... How tall is the Eye?

How tall... How tall is Big Ben?

[chattering]

* All right \*

Since then, I've been working as a technology correspondent for about two years now. It's been great.

Cool, that's awesome. So you do, like,

TV reports and, like, you're like...

- No, just the website.

- Oh, just the website?

I mean, there's some video stuff, but tech industry pieces mainly.

Cool, tech. Tech's awesome. Tech's...

So where have you been so far?

Travelling around the map like Indiana Jones?

- Yeah.

- Where the adventure line goes zigzagging all over the place.

Yeah, actually, I'm almost done. Uh...

But I started off, flew into

Sydney, went to Thailand.

- Oh, jealous.

- India. Yeah.

Did Rome, went to Rome.

- Did the whole Europe vacation.

- Even I haven't done that.

- Oh, really?

- Mm.

It was awesome. I went to Pamplona in Spain.

- Is that where they do the bull runs?

- Ran with the bulls.

- You ran with the bulls?

- I ran with the bulls.

- That's how I got this.

- Look at that!

You really are Indiana Jones.

Have you got your whip in your bag and your hat?

I saved the world from the Nazis.

That was pretty cool.

I, you know, just... trying to do, you know, shit I've never done before.

Is that what you're doing on this trip?

You're, like, finding yourself?

Yeah, um... in a way.

I mean, I... [stammers]

Really to get away from the family home is what I'm doing.

Oh.

Yeah, that was...

Whatever, that's boring.

Yeah, well, I'm afraid

Britain's pretty tame as far as daredevil opportunities go.

Yeah? It's alright, it's the last leg of the trip anyway so...

I'm... unfortunately home next week.

- Not much time...

- Next week?

- Yeah.

- That's not very long.

- No, it's not.

- Mnh-mnh.

So... I could use some suggestions on fun shit to do.

- Hmm. Fun shit to do?

- Fun shit to do.

[groans] Ow! Ow!

[laughs] Jesus!

Hello.

- Good morning.

- Good morning.

Oh. Another battle scar.

[laughs] Kind of.

Let me guess, you were, like,

[American accent] totally shark fishing in Cape Town, dude.

[laughs] Is that your best American accent?

- Yes.

- That's pretty good. No, um...

It was courtesy of Josh Peters, high school dick.

He and I got into a fight in shop class.

And he hit me with this, like, metal rod thing.

- What an arsehole.

- [laughs]

[posh English accent] What an arsehole.

- That's terrible.

- I'm sorry.

- [phone vibrates]

- Is that you or me?

Oh, it's gotta be you.

"Mom." You're so American.

Yes, I am.

Are you not gonna get that?

Okay, that was a little impersonal.

What, you wanna talk to her now?

- You wanna talk to my mum? I'll call back.

- Fair point.

[laughs]

I don't think so.

[clears throat]

You hungry?

Wow, look at all these games.

You're, like, a gamer. Cool.

Of course I am. For my job.

What, a girl never beat you at Street Fighter?

Is this... Like, this is, like, your dating manual?

[laughs]

What? The Singularity?

It's when computers learn to outsmart man like women did years ago.

Oh! Wow!

See, what I was doing, it was like a joke.

- You know?

- Really?

- Yeah.

- Well, that's what you call a joke?

Mm-hmm. Yeah, you guys have those.

- You guys have those here, right?

- Yeah, yeah. We do at the moment.

Ow!

That was a good joke. That was a good joke.

Enjoy your Marmite.

Whoa! Oh, my... [laughs]

Do you guys seriously eat this shit?

- Okay, alright.

- [phone vibrates]

Alright, saved by mum.

The best way to actually just stop her from calling is...

I don't know, answer it.

Yeah, it's kind of like a can of worms

I just don't wanna open right now, so...

She's worried. You're her son.

You've been travelling, and I just think if you speak to her, then...

Yeah, well, I still live at home with her back in Syracuse.

- That's cool. That's fine.

- Yeah.

I was taking care of my dad.

Oh, shit. Is he...?

- ...okay?

- No, he died.

- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

- Last year. No, it's okay.

It was coming for a while.

It was early onset Alzheimer's.

Oh, that must have been really... uh... tough.

Yeah, he was my best friend.

Sometimes he'd just look at me and wouldn't even know who I was.

Well, my mum, like, I don't even...

I don't know how to talk to her.

You know, I don't have that connection.

I don't even know where to start.

So that's why I left.

That's why I went on this trip.

Just to get away and make, you know, all the memories that I can... while I can.

And I know I gotta talk to her and I gotta just... [laughs]

But not on this. You know,

I just... I'll deal with it.

I'll deal with it when I get back, you know. I'll just...

[kisses]

You're a good guy, Cooper.

Call your mum.

[beeping]

[exhales]

[machine beeps]

Zero, zero, one, nine, three, nine, two, nine.

No, I did not buy a pair of sandals in Koh Samui last night because I'm in...

And how long does that take?

Because I need to buy a ticket back to America.

[groans]

Oh, my God.

Mm-hmm.

[sighs]

[groans]

Can I just say, this is the most blatant cover story for a second hook-up ever?

Yes! Yes! Oh, my God.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Alright. Don't forget your bag.

The bag, yep, my bag.

Alright. You are a top bird.

I don't know what that means, but I heard somebody say it once, and you're it.

I got a plan. [laughs]

Yeah. It's odd jobs.

- For who?

- For, like, it's an app.

You can kind of... like, I've used it all over when funds were low, so...

- Oh, there's some interesting ones.

- Pretty cool.

- "Thrillseekers wanted."

- Ooh.

- This looks right up your street.

- Okay.

Okay, four pound signs.

That's a biggie. That's good.

It's a little out of town.

And some kind of play test deal for a company called Saitoo...

Saitogoo...

- SaitoGemu?

- SaitoGemu. Yeah.

They're huge.

- They're really big.

- Really?

- Horror games?

- Uh...

Have you heard of...

Oh, what's one of theirs?

- Harlech Shadow.

- Harlech Shadow? Yes, I have.

I used to play that in my buddy David Ludwig's basement when we were, like, seventh grade.

Well, that's Shou Saito.

It's his company.

- He's like this genius, super secretive.

- Okay.

And apparently, they're working on this new project.

Big money involved. Groundbreaking.

But nobody knows anything about it.

Well, maybe if I play my cards right

I can get you an exclusive with Shou.

Hmm? Fo Shou? Yeah?

[laughs]

You should take a photo.

Seriously, if you get a photo of anything that they're working on, that's a fuckload more money than four pound signs.

Cool.

Well, where is this place?

[door opens]

[woman] Mr. Copper.

Oh, hi. Um... Just Cooper.

Mr. Cooper, I apologize.

Just Cooper is fine. [laughs]

Then, in that case, I'm just Katie.

- Hi.

- Hi.

- Follow me.

- Oh, yeah.

- I'll just get my pack here.

- Rav will take care of that.

Oh, Rav will take care of that. Okay, great.

That's good. I don't wanna carry it anyway.

Rav kind of reminds me of like an end-of-level boss.

You know, haiukon. Just...

- How was your journey?

- Great. Thanks.

- The car pick you up okay?

- Yeah.

[Cooper] Wow.

This way.

Are they... seeing? It's cool. Very cool.

Wow.

[Katie] Come on.

Feel like I'm gonna go meet Dumbledore.

[laughs] Hope I get Gryffindor.

I'm gonna need your phone and anything else you might use to send and receive.

- A little paranoid, don't you think?

- Can't be too careful.

Okay, there you go.

Wow, you really are paranoid. Whoa! [laughs]

It's white.

Um...

Okay, so I'm guessing this says, like,

I agree to have my kidneys harvested?

Actually, it's a pretty standard NDA-disclaimer thing.

Okay.

It's important that you realize there is a small medical procedure involved.

Sorry, for a game?

Nothing permanent and we don't harvest your kidneys,

- I promise.

- Okay.

It's no more invasive than having your ears pierced.

"Confidential information, brain downloads the game, duration, termination..."

Um... The signature page...

- Where do I sign?

- Oh.

- Signature. Yeah.

- There's a page missing.

- Okay.

- Just a moment.

Alright. I'll just wait... here.

[door locks]

What the fuck?

[camera clicks]

[door unlocks]

- All good?

- All good.

What we're working on is an interactive augmented reality system.

- Like VR?

- More like layers on top of reality.

Oh.

- Okay. Um...

- [beeping]

Ow.

[whistles]

Um...

- What's that?

- We call this a mushroom.

- Like Mario Brothers?

- If you like.

- You're qualified to do this, right?

- I haven't killed anyone yet.

May I?

Yeah. [laughs]

[drilling sound]

All done.

- That was it?

- See, I told you I'm good.

- No, don't worry, it's not permanent.

- Um...

Okay. What is this, like, some kind of memory test or something like that?

- You'll find out.

- Oh, okay.

You might feel a slight twinge as it initializes.

Oh, okay.

Commencing at 5:38.

- You ready?

- Yes, sir!

[beeping]

[beeping]

- Nearly there.

- [loud static crackling]

[phone vibrating]

I thought I turned that off.

- All done. You feel okay?

- Uh-huh.

Feel great.

- Watch the targets.

- Okay.

Um...

[electronic whoosh]

[Cooper laughs]

Is...

- What do you see?

- [laughs]

- [squeaks]

- Like a... um...

[laughs] Like a video game gopher.

- Is it more detailed now?

- Yeah.

Yep, yeah.

- And now?

- Holy fuck!

Holy shit! He... Fuck. He's right...

He's right... He's right... Can I...

- [electrical crackling]

- Whoo!

He's not real. He's a sort of mental projection.

- You can see him. I can't.

- You can't?

- Wow! Oh, okay.

- [squeaks]

Give him a whack.

Give him a whack? Oh. Okay, alright.

[squeaks]

- [laughs]

- [squeaks]

Okay! Alright, so just like whack-a-mole.

- Mm-hmm.

- I've played it a million times. Okay.

Alright. [clears throat]

Here we go. Come on up.

[squeaks]

Oh! Where you coming up?

[laughs]

No. No.

- No.

- [squeaks]

[banging]

Oh!

[mutters]

[laughs]

Oh!

- [squeaks]

- Alright. Stay down.

Oh! Okay. [grunting]

Good game. Very good game.

You are so adorable.

- Okay, bye. Bye.

- [squeaks]

- Is that it?

- Afraid so.

Oh.

Now, were the gophers two-dimensional or three?

Three. No, no, no.

3D, super 3D. Like... Yeah.

- Now this is just a limited test demo.

- That was a demo?

I think you should beta test the full experience we're working on.

There'd be more money in it, of course. If you're game?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Uh-huh, I'm game. I'm game.

- This is Shou Saito.

- Oh! [laughs]

- You must be our latest volunteer.

- Hi.

- This is really great. Hi.

- [speaking Japanese]

[speaking Japanese] Hi.

I just... I wanted to say that the mole game, super fun.

Super fun... fun.

[speaking Japanese]

- Fun?

- Fun.

- Fun is good.

- Yeah. Oh.

- Playing games is good.

- Mm.

Your heart goes faster.

- You smile.

- Yeah.

Yeah. Or, um... scream.

Oh! [laughs]

I have always liked to make the player jump.

Frightened. You get scared, you jump.

- Afterwards, you feel good.

- Yeah.

You glow.

Why?

Oh, um...

Because of the adrenaline rush.

- Yes.

- Yeah.

But mostly because you are still alive.

You have faced your greatest fears in a safe environment.

It is a release of fear.

It liberates you.

Yeah. I mean, totally.

What we are working on now is the most personal survival horror game in history.

[laughs] Cool.

One that works out how to scare you by using your own mind.

Whoa. That... [laughs] That sounds crazy.

- [beeping]

- Can't wait!

[Katie] I'm uploading a neural net package.

Neural net packing, neural net. Hmm.

Name could use a little work, I think.

It's all 90s.

I'm just kidding, it's a good name.

It's state of the art intelligence software.

It learns and adapts on the fly.

It'll monitor your brain activity and try and work out how best to frighten you and then adjust to your experience accordingly.

Whoa!

- Are you ready?

- Oh, yeah.

- Beam me up. Here we go, lock and load.

- Eyes closed.

- Time is currently 6:17 p.m.

- Okay.

It's uploading. Five, four, three, two, one.

[Katie] How are you feeling?

Um...

I feel good. I feel normal.

Okay. Stand up, slowly.

[laughs]

Are you ready to play?

[Cooper] Isn't this the

Harlech Shadow house?

[Katie] It's part of the estate.

The gamekeeper's lodge, actually.

But, yeah, this was the model.

The layout was replicated for the game and the texture scanned.

- Wow!

- [Katie laughs]

[Cooper] Very, very cool.

[door clangs shut]

[Cooper] So what's the game, what do I do?

[Katie] You don't have to do anything.

You just stay in here alone, see how long you last until you're too scared to continue.

[Cooper] So all I have to do is, like, stay here?

And I get paid for that?

I'll be back in the control room, watching.

There are cameras all over, so no stealing the silverware.

And now there's this.

- And what's this?

- It's an earpiece.

Oh!

Yeah, just pop it in, and you and I will be in contact the whole time.

Oh, cool.

And I can, like, talk to you, and you'll hear it? Great, that's great.

Now, nothing you'll see can physically harm you.

It's all just audio-visual, like the gopher game.

Oh, okay.

But if it does get too intense, we can pull you out at any time

- and stop the experiment.

- Okay.

Is there a safe word you can think of?

Something easy to remember in distress?

How about the word "stop"?

- Good choice. "Stop" it is.

- Yeah.

Okay, we'll leave you to enjoy your evening.

- Alright.

- You'll hear from me in a moment.

Just make yourself at home.

Okay, all right.

Well, take her easy. [laughs]

[door clangs shut]

[door locks]

[clears throat]

[snaps fingers]

Harlech... Shadow.

[chuckles]

[coughs]

[whistles]

Is this real? Yeah, it's real.

That's real. It's really dead.

[whistles]

- [Katie] Cooper.

- Oh, hey.

- Are you hearing me?

- Loud and clear.

Oh!

Reaching for the Dutch courage already, I see.

[sighs]

- I'm afraid that wine's non-alcoholic.

- Lame.

- Well, we need you with a clear head.

- Okay. Fair point. Fair point.

This is high-quality craftsmanship.

This is nice.

Yeah. It's good woodwork.

- That's this place.

- Full marks for observation.

Mm-hmm! Yep!

[sighs]

[Cooper grunting]

[panting]

Alright, there we go. [sighs]

[sighs]

Ah!

- Oh, shit.

- What's up?

I just forgot I don't have my phone.

I keep going for it,

I forget it's not in my pocket.

And there's, uh... no TV here, so...

Welcome to the 19th century.

No TV, no Internet, no wi-fi.

Yeah. No wonder people were seeing shit.

Probably were just bored out of their gourds.

Well, that's the leading theory about ghost sightings.

The mind plays tricks when less stimulated.

Fewer distractions, people saw more ghosts.

Isn't that a nice piece of info?

[both chuckle]

Well, they got literature, though.

That's pretty sweet, right?

Oh, my God, I can't remember the actual last time that I read a book.

To think people used to do this on purpose.

I know. Crazy. Why? [laughs]

- You know, I don't think I've...

- Shh, alright?

I need to get into some old-school shit here. Concentrate.

[laughs] Pardon me.

Can I point out your heart rate just increased?

Yeah. Well, it should have cos there's a huge crazy spider. [laughs]

You see a spider?

- You don't... you don't see that?

- No.

Don't... Don't walk. Don't...

Holy shit!

Tough guy like you, scared of spiders.

Yeah, I'm just not fond of them.

It's worked out you're an arachnophobe quickly.

It's probing for weak spots.

God damn it.

Fucker!

[crunch]

Yeah! [laughs]

Um...

Okay.

Yeah, well, yeah.

Whole lot more realistic than the gopher game.

It's good. It's good graphics.

It's good, uh... Yeah.

Weak sauce.

[electricity crackling]

- What is it?

- Just...

Nothing. Nothing.

Here with the figures.

There's a... No. There's a light on... now, in the...

Can you... zoom in and... Zoom in on it?

And you can see what

I'm talking about. Whoa!

- Cooper...

- And now there's... Shh!

There's a guy in the window.

That wasn't... [laughs]

- Yeah.

- [cracking sound]

And now he's gone.

Now nobody's in the window.

- Which is the...

- [creaking]

Mm-hmm. [laughs]

Yeah, there's a...

[footsteps]

Just leaky pipes.

[metallic banging]

I knew it. It was leaky pipes, like...

- Holy fuck! [screams]

- [cage rattles]

[screams]

Fuck!

[screams]

[laughs] Oh! Oh!

Okay. [laughs]

- That got me. You got me.

- [laughs]

- [laughs]

- What are you seeing?

Like a creepy fucking guy.

Wow, just...

Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

He kinda looks like Josh Peters.

- It's Josh Peters! You're Josh Peters!

- Sorry?

You're Josh Peters from high school!

From a guy I know at high school.

The system could be mining some of your personal memories for texture.

Was Josh Peters someone you were scared of?

He was a bully. I wasn't scared.

I wasn't scared of him, but he was a bully and...

Man! Take a couple of Krav

Maga classes and I'd be ready.

I'd be ready! [grunts]

[grunts]

Kali ma! Dah!

I'm gonna get some wine. Re-up.

I'd offer you some, but I don't think you can drink it so... [laughs]

Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Catch ya later, Peters.

This non-alcoholic wine is pretty good.

I'm not like a expert or anything, but it's kinda great.

I was in France.

I stayed at this, like, vineyard, and they had this wine, like, grape-stomping festival.

Now that, that wine was good. I know that.

You're being discursive.

- What is discursive? Discursive?

- Talkative.

- Mm-hmm.

- Rambling.

[laughs] Is that a problem?

People sometimes talk more when they're afraid.

Helps compensate for the fear.

- Masks it, too.

- Oh, yeah?

Similar to when you've got the TV on late at night.

The voices make you feel less alone.

Even though you are alone.

You aren't scaring me, Katie. [laughs]

Pity.

Is there like a refrigerator here?

- There's some snacks in the cupboard.

- [door creaks]

Alrighty. Eenie meenie, miney...

Mo! Alright.

Okay, ginger snaps.

Let's see.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. This'll do.

Now... um...

He's gonna be right behind this door when I close it, isn't he? [laughs]

Yeah, that's how this works.

[laughs]

Knew it. Jump scares get pretty old...

[screams]

Fuck!

Oh, God.

- What the hell is that?

- What do you see?

[shudders]

Holy shit!

A fucking... Uh...

Hard to explain.

It's like a huge-ass spider with a face and dicks coming out of his mouth.

It's...

Peters. Peters is inside.

Like a Peters-spider mash-up.

Ah, Katie! Are you doing this, or is this fucking me?

- I think that's all you.

- [groans] I'm so fucked up!

God! Fuck!

Holy shit, you're fucking gross.

- [Katie's voice distorted]

- Yeah...

Sorry, can you say again?

Katie, hello?

Damn it, Katie!

Whenever you come back online, just say the word.

No, I'm not scared, just... bored.

[loud knocking]

That you guys?

[loud knocking]

Coming to fix the earpiece?

That's probably a good idea.

- [loud knocking]

- Yeah. Yeah.

[loud knocking]

- [groans] Fuck it, man!

- [loud knocking]

[loud knocking]

Come on!

You're in danger.

Sonja?

[door closes]

Now we're talking.

Alright, this is incredible.

This... very impressive.

I am thoroughly impressed.

I am... Wow! Wow!

You look so real.

You're, like, just like her.

I mean, wow.

Except... you're just unfortunately not... um...

- Cooper, what are you doing?

- Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

- Cooper, you're in danger.

- Shh! Quiet. Quiet! I need to think.

You're fucking real.

You are real. You're real.

- Cooper, you're in...

- You're Sonja. You're actually here.

- Are you actually here right now?

- I'm real. I'm actually here.

- God.

- And we have to go.

- You have to listen to me.

- How are you here?

You know that photo that you sent me?

I dug around and apparently

Shou Saito took out a patent for a computer brain interface last year.

How are you real? I don't...

Okay, fuck. I don't...

They brought you here! [laughs]

You are, you're real, and they brought you here, and they're trying to fuck with me.

Nice try, good try.

I get it. It's part of the test.

His patent got rejected outright. They said it was insane, it was dangerous.

Wow. Really? How much are they paying you?

Honestly. Cos you're killing it right now.

- Have they given you something?

- Sorry, I thought you were fake.

But now I know you're real,

I'm being a really terrible host.

I got some non-alcoholic wine.

Might put us in the mood.

- Cooper, what I want to do is...

- We'll talk about it in the kitchen.

- Cooper!

- Sonja, relax, okay?

Give it up. I know, the jig's up, okay? Let it go.

Look, Cooper, there's more.

Five people have disappeared in the past year.

All tourists, all registered with that stupid odd jobs app.

Oh, yeah? Wow. God, that's crazy.

Whatever they're doing to you, whatever they've done to you, it's dangerous, and we really have to go now, Cooper.

[laughs] Okay, okay. Alright.

- Well, if your story's true...

- Cooper.

- Then how'd you find me?

- What?

How'd you know where I am?

It's a games company,

I looked up the address.

Yeah, really?

No, no, no, no. How'd you find me here? This place.

- I tracked you.

- You tracked me?

Yeah, with your GPS on your phone. Find My Friends.

Find My Friends? That would've worked, but they took my phone.

And it's in a building, like, a mile away.

So, yeah, nice try.

That's right. [laughs]

So much for women outsmarting men.

Singularity that!

Look, all I'm saying is that

I think that you could've come up with a better story, it could have been funny or...

Okay, alright, don't be pissed.

Do you ever wonder how your bank account got hacked?

What are you doing?

- I cloned your card as you were asleep.

- Whoa. Okay.

Put the knife down.

What are you going to do with that?

I drew your attention to this job.

Sonja, put the fucking knife down, okay? It's not funny.

Should've called your mum, Cooper.

- But you called me, and I led you here...

- Sonja.

- You know what?

- ...like a breadcrumb trail.

Put the knife down. Drop the act.

Okay, seriously, drop the knife, Sonja.

It's not fucking funny. Put the knife...

This isn't what I signed up for.

I'm fucking done, okay?

- Fuck!

- [screams]

[screams]

What the fuck? [screams]

[groans]

[Sonja screams]

Oh, fuck! Oh!

[groans]

[gasps]

[groans]

Holy fuck!

Stop!

- [Katie] Cooper.

- [screams] Katie!

- Katie!

- Cooper.

- Katie!

- Cooper, what's happening?

What the fuck happened?

What's happening? We've been talking.

You've not been responding.

- You said I wouldn't feel anything!

- What are you seeing? What's there?

- Fuck! She's gone now.

- Who's gone?

Oh, my God, I-I felt it.

There's a knife in my arm!

- In my shoulder.

- Cooper, who was there?

- Fuck... Sonja.

- Who?

Sonja. She's this girl that I know, that fucking... She stabbed me.

- She had a fucking knife.

- Nothing can harm you, Cooper.

- No, no, no, no. She was solid.

- No, she can't have been.

She... I was stabbed! I would know!

Nothing you see can harm or even touch you.

It's purely audio-visual.

- There's no physical sensation.

- Fuck! Yes, there was!

- Cooper, you need to calm down.

- I know because I felt it, okay?

I felt her arm, it was warm, and I felt her fucking stab me in the shoulder.

- That's not possible.

- [sighs] Oh, my God.

- It's not possible, Cooper.

- Yeah, it is! Yeah, it is!

Physical sensations shouldn't be possible.

- Unless, I mean...

- Oh, God. Unless what?

I don't know. The neuron net, it could have maybe worked out some means of replicating physical experiences,

- but that would be unprecedented.

- Jesus Christ.

Okay, you know what? Stop the game.

I want out. Just pull me out now.

Stop, stop, stop. Safe word. Fucking stop!

- Okay, okay, just let us work it out.

- Oh, God.

No, I want this fucking thing out now.

Cooper, do not attempt to remove that yourself.

Removing it yourself is extremely dangerous.

- [screams]

- Stop that, that could kill you!

Just stay calm!

- [Shou speaks Japanese]

- Is that Shou?

Is that Shou? What's he saying?

What's he saying?

Okay, Cooper. We're gonna commence with deactivation.

Oh, that's great news.

We need you to follow instructions and make it to the access point.

The access point? Great.

Where the fuck's the access point?

- Oh, fuck! More stairs? Come on!

- Just one more level.

- Trust me.

- [sighs] Okay.

- [groans]

- Left at the top.

- Okay, which door?

- Room at the end.

[panting]

What is it?

There's gonna be something behind there. I can feel it.

- Something like...

- Like what?

Some personal fucked-up shit.

Like... I don't know, I could feel it digging around in my head.

Cooper, get to the door.

It's gonna be like my mum,

I don't know, dead.

- Your mum?

- Fucking swinging from a fucking beam.

- Your mother is not in there.

- You're not in control of this!

It's in my head. It fucking knows. It knows.

- It knows!

- It knows what?

It knows I got this thing with my mum.

Cooper, I promise you, she's not in there.

- Now open the door.

- Oh, my God.

It's the only way I can get you out. Listen to me.

Okay, Okay. Fuck. Okay.

Whatever's in there cannot harm you.

But I can't get you out unless you open that door, Cooper.

Okay.

Would you kindly open the door?

Here we go. Here we go.

[breathes heavily]

[sighs] Okay.

Okay, okay, I'm in the room.

Where's the access point?

Access point?

- There is no access point.

- What?

[Katie laughs]

I'm fucking with you, Cooper.

I told you to come up here to see if we've broken you enough to obey instructions without question.

- And we have.

- Oh, no, no, no.

Katie, come on. Katie, come on, let me out!

Katie, let me out, come on! What the fuck!

Oh, what are you gonna do?

Oh, what are you doing to me?

- Why are you doing this?

- You thought you'd see your mother.

- Oh, fuck!

- What does she look like?

[stammering]

Your mother, can you describe her face?

Her hair colour?

She...

Is she tall, short, fat, thin?

- Where did you grow up?

- She...

What's your favourite band?

Your favourite flavour ice cream?

The name of the girl who stabbed you?

You don't know any of these things, do you?

Don't you think that's odd?

It's fucking taking my memories!

Overwriting them, technically.

[gasps] Fuck.

Look in the mirror behind you.

Do you recognize yourself?

Do you even know who you're looking at?

Soon you won't be anything.

You'll be just like your dad.

Shut up, shut up, shut up.

- That's what really scares you, isn't it?

- Stop it.

- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

- You're going the same place he did.

Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

- You're going nowhere.

- Shut up! Shut up.

[voice echoes] You should have called mum. She's all that's left.

- You abandoned her.

- No, no, no, no!

Get out of my head!

You'll never see her again.

You'll never speak to her again.

- Never see her face.

- Get out of my fucking head!

Get out of my fucking head!

Get out of my fucking head!

You're a bad son. You'll never see your mother again.

- You're going nowhere.

- [wails]

Straight into oblivion.

You deserve it.

You should have called her.

Get out of my fucking head!

[screams]

Get it out of my head!

Get it out of my head!

Get it out of my fucking head!

Cooper, I'm gonna shut it off, okay?

I just need to connect.

Get it out of my head!

[screams] Get it out of my head!

Get it out of my head!

Oh, my God. [wails] Where am I?

[speaking Japanese]

[Katie speaking Japanese]

- Who are you?

- [Katie speaking Japanese]

- [Cooper sobs]

- I can't stop it.

[sobs]

I don't know who I am.

So I... So I need to go home.

The interface has data tendrils like roots.

They've dug in deeper than they're meant to.

Threaded through your brain, taken over whole areas, I can't stop it.

I can't remove it, and I can't stop it.

[whispers] But I...

But I don't know who I am.

I don't know... I don't know who I am.

I don't know who I am.

I don't know.

On behalf of Saito Game Team,

I most humbly apologize.

[weak voice] Who are you?

What have you done to me?

- What have you done to me?

- Put him with the others, please.

[wails] No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop, stop, stop!

Stop, stop, stop, stop! No, don't, don't!

[screaming] Don't! Don't!

Stop! Stop!

[high-pitched whistle]

No!

Oh, fuck. [gasps]

That was one second.

Either he's super susceptible to this or the software is way too powerful still.

It's jumped from zero to

18K in five milliseconds...

[Shou] I'm sorry. The experience was more powerful than intended, Mr. Cooper.

I hope you can forgive us.

All electronic devices should now be turned off and stowed as they may interfere with the aircraft's navigational and communication....

Mum?

Mum?

I have to call him.

Mum?

Why did Cooper go?

- I...

- Mom, I'm right here. I'm...

- I'm right here, Mum.

- I have to call Cooper.

I have to call and make sure that he's safe.

I have to call him. I have to call him.

I have to call him.

Mum?

[woman on TV] Grammy-award-winning rapper Tusk is still with us.

[cheering]

Now, Tusk, there are loads of online videos of people trying to emulate you, but this is our favourite.

Take a look at this.

[laughter and cheering]

It's a young chap called Aaron Sheen.

He's nine years old.

[laughs] That is one goofy-looking kid.

- [laughter]

- Not a good dancer.

He's nine years old!

Come on, he's a pretty good dancer.

That young motherfucker can't dance for shit.

He should probably just give up now, actually.

Don't hate on me for keeping it real.

That's a goofy little motherfucker, and he can't dance for shit.

[woman] He is a big fan, Tusk.

- [Tusk] Don't hate on your boy.

- [phone beeps]

[woman]

Everybody's got to start somewhere.

[Tusk] Start somewhere?

I looked better than that...

- DCI Parke?

- No press.

No, I'm not press. Um... TDC Blue Colson.

I'm your shadow.

My shadow? They said...

Sorry. Call me Karin.

- Did you say your name was...?

- Blue.

- B-l-u-e, Blue?

- Yeah. It's not a nickname.

- My dad liked the sound of it.

- Uh-huh.

- Seen a body before?

- A couple.

- On video, I mean.

- [man] Boss?

- This is Blue. She's my shadow.

- [helicopter whirrs]

- DS Nick Shelton.

- What've we got?

- Jo Powers.

- As in...

As in actual Jo Powers.

Saw something she wrote the other day about the wheelchair woman.

Clickbait piece. Pissed people off.

That article was fucking horrendous.

Even I signed the petition.

To get her sacked.

Come on.

Neighbours heard her screaming and called it in.

[Karin] Hell of a struggle.

Anyone else at home?

Husband. Found slashed across the stomach.

- By her?

- Don't know.

He was unconscious.

They've taken him to St. Columbus.

[Blue] Her mentions are still pouring in.

Restraining bolt's in place.

- No other points of entry?

- No. But the outside's ringed with CCTV.

- We got the code for the cams?

- Uh-huh.

Okay, then. Check the recordings.

Bag that, send it to Toxicology.

Full autop for her, and we question the husband as soon as he wakes up.

Come on.

- You think it's the husband?

- I'm keeping options open.

Cutting the throat, that's unusual.

Thanks, chaps.

- But you do think he did it?

- Don't know anything yet.

These things are almost always either drink, drugs or domestic.

It is how it is.

- You driving home?

- No licence. Never passed.

I'm sort of waiting for driverless to go mainstream.

- Get in.

- No, honestly, I'll get the Tube.

- Get in.

- Oh. Okay.

- So you were in Tech Crime?

- Digital Forensics. Computer murk.

[Karin] What happened, you get bored of it?

Not exactly. You've seen what people tuck away on these.

Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.

It's not boring.

I'm old enough to remember when they walked around with that stuff just tucked away in their heads.

[Blue] Right. But now they can't help but entrusting it to their little companions.

These things absorb who we are.

They know everything about us.

[Karin] If it's interesting, why leave Forensics?

The Rannoch case.

- Ian Rannoch?

- The child killings, yeah.

I was the one who cracked his souvenir folder.

- So you saw those pictures?

- Mm-hmm.

And the videos too. Saw them all.

You see something like that, it changes you.

You either get defeated or you think...

You think, "Fuck me!

I've got to help stop that shit."

Yeah.

- I mean, out here in the field...

- What fucking field?

You know what I mean.

Out here in the real world, you can genuinely prevent stuff, can't you?

You are young.

Maybe you're old?

- [Karin] Steady.

- [chuckles]

Thanks.

- See you tomorrow.

- Yes, boss.

[woman onTV] Jo Powers has been found dead at her home in West London.

The veteran columnist had been at the centre of controversy over an article she'd written about disability rights activist Gwen Marbury.

The police have yet to confirm the cause...

[clicks]

[man] It's just the first floor, first door on the...

- Starting early?

- I asked Nick to show me the CCTV.

- Oh, yeah?

- Yeah.

No one came in or out.

Just Jo and her husband all evening.

- And that one there?

- Rear patio.

- Bust for months by the looks of it.

- Someone could've come in through there.

They'd have to climb the fence, make it in and out, knowing the camera wasn't working, but yeah, could have happened. Technically.

Okay, sorry.

You're keen to help.

- She just asked!

- Uh-huh.

[sighs]

[sighs]

\_

[Karin clears throat]

Um... So...

I'm collating every threat or insult levelled at Jo Powers over the previous 48 hours.

Say it is the husband.

That's a coincidence, isn't it?

Not really.

You've got everyone throwing a shit fit.

Stress levels in that household would've been through the roof.

That Internet stuff drifts off like weather.

It's half hate. They don't mean it.

The hate in a marriage, that's in 3D.

That's had work put into it.

That's sincere.

- Yeah. I'm divorced.

- Um...

Husband's up and talking.

You're gonna love his alibi.

[siren wailing]

[phone rings]

I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.

And when I ran in, she was walking

'round the room, stumbling.

She was clutching... She was clutching her head as if she was in pain.

And then for a moment, she stopped.

And then it was like a seizure, she was... thrashing... clawing at her own skin.

And she turned...

[sobs]

She smashed her head... onto the desk, hard.

Then she... she pushed me over.

That must've been when the bottle smashed.

Then she picked it up, and she started cutting herself.

Here. She was gouging.

[sobs] I tried to stop her.

But she did this.

Then she cut her throat.

I tried to stop her.

She cut her own throat with the glass!

[man whimpers]

[cries]

[Karin]Mutilated and then killed herself for no apparent reason?

I'd say the odds are against that.

He said it was like she was having a seizure.

Maybe there was something in the cake.

- The cake?

- It had "fucking bitch" iced on it.

- Could've been something in it.

- Like a drug?

- I don't know.

- That makes people kill themselves?

He was sort of convincing.

- He just doesn't seem the...

- Don't say "the type."

He's ordinary. That is the type.

What, so he bounced her head off the desk?

- Blue.

- Held her steady enough...

- Blue.

- What?

- Toxicology are looking at the cake.

- Okay.

Meantime, let's drop in on the person that sent it.

Got the name this morning.

- You don't need to patronize me.

- We're doing what you want.

- Following another lead.

- That you think is a waste of time.

Picking along dead ends just to prove they're dead ends, that's most of the job.

I'm not saying it's a waste of time.

Just... you haven't had a chance to get bored of reality yet.

Okay, that was patronizing.

- Is this who sent the cake?

- [Karin] Uh-huh.

- Have we checked her social feeds?

- I don't know.

"Death to Jo Powers."

She posted that on Monday morning.

The bakery said that they're not meant to do obscenities, so I said it was for my sister, like just a joke thing, and they agreed, so...

Not cheap, their cakes.

With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?

Um...

Well, I didn't pay for it all myself.

- We all put a pound in each.

- We?

Yeah. I'm on a mums and carers message board.

I held a sort of whip-round.

- You crowd-sourced the money?

- Yeah, if you like.

From 80 other people?

Look, I'm not... [laughs]

I'm not being funny, okay?

I know she is dead.

But did you read what she had written?

How much do you think she got paid for spouting that horrible shit?

I don't know.

- I was just using my freedom of speech.

- To send a threatening message.

[scoffs] It was funny, okay?

And I can see if I'd done it myself, then that would be a bit weird, but I'm not mental.

You wished she was dead.

Well, uh...

[stammers] No, no, I didn't.

[phone beeps]

- "Death to Jo Powers."

- [laughs] That's just...

It's a... a hashtag game, you know, like "Death to..."

You insert the name of someone who's being an arsehole.

It's not... real. It's a joke thing.

And who started it? The hashtag?

I don't know. I don't know.

I saw it somewhere.

[phone beeps]

Excuse us a moment.

Toxicology say the cake's clean.

They also said:

"Thanks, it was delicious."

We'll give her a caution.

Offensive Communications Act.

- Does that cover cakes?

- As far as she's concerned, it does.

What about the others who chipped in?

Are you going to tell them off, too?

- I didn't do anything.

- Start a thread about it.

Hospital's discharging the husband tomorrow.

We'll bring him in for questioning.

Blue? We're arresting the husband.

Don't wallow in that.

The Internet will be pissed off with someone else today.

[Nick] Tusk.

Everyone's pissed off with Tusk

'cause of that thing with the kid.

He's catching a shit storm on social media.

- Liza will be organising the cake now.

- Yeah.

- See you tomorrow.

- See you.

\_

- Whoo!

- ♪ Turn a penny to a grand ♪

♪ When I'm ready, rocking steady for my fans ♪

Where my ladies at?

- Yo! Good show.

- Yeah, that's a good show, brother.

- I'm feeling my shit.

- You want some of that?

- What you smoking?

- Good shit, boy.

A'ight.

Damn!

Eyes on, eyes on, eyes on.

Don't stress. It's legal here.

Pfft! Keep forgetting.

Welcome to Europe, I guess.

- Kinda takes the joy out of it.

- Tell me about it.

- [clatter]

- Careful! You break it, you pay for it.

- Always doing some bullshit.

- [Tusk yelling]

- [screams]

- Tusk? Tusk?

[screaming]

Yo, yo! We need some help over here!

[screams hysterically]

- I got you.

- Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!

Call an ambulance!

[screaming]

[monitor beeping]

[typing]

- [whirring]

- Commencing.

[rattling]

[beeping]

- Did he say what it is?

- Nope.

[buzzer]

- Good morning.

- Morning.

[man] She's in here.

So I go in, and there's not just the wound from the glass.

There's a hole. Dug in.

A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.

So I follow it, you know, how deep does it go?

It goes all the way from her ear canal to deep in her brain.

Where I find this.

Nestled right in there. Looks quite cosy.

- [Karin] It's one of those bee things.

- [Blue] An ADI.

An Autonomous Drone Insect from the Granular Project.

- How did it get in there?

- I'd say it burrowed in.

- Fuck me.

- [man] That's not the worst part.

It crawled right through her dorsal posterior insula, which is basically the brain's pain centre.

You're talking agony off the scale.

- You'd do anything to make it stop.

- Even cut your own throat.

- Good afternoon.

- DCI Parke.

- TDC Blue Colson.

- Okay. Thank you.

[Karin] They're so fucking fancy-looking, these companies.

- Billions on branding.

- Well, they can afford it.

The whole ADI project's pretty much bankrolled by the government.

It's why so many people are paranoid about it.

Let me guess, this is some people on the Internet?

They reckon the government uses the bees to spy on us.

There's a schizophrenic world view.

[buzzing]

[buzzing]

Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself living in the future, but here I fucking well am.

- Karin Parke?

- Uh-huh.

Vanessa Dahl.

Please. Follow me.

You're after information on our Project Swarm ADIs?

[Karin] That's right.

[Vanessa] Any particular reason?

Yes.

[buzzing]

Rasmus.

Rasmus Sjoberg.

- He heads Swarm.

- Nice to meet you.

- Hi.

- Hi.

- Nice greenhouse.

- Yeah.

[buzzing]

[Karin] So, your bees, your ADIs, talk me through them.

Colony Collapse Disorder.

We still don't know what's behind it.

Bees themselves were virtually extinct so what our ADIs do is effectively stand in for them.

They're solar powered.

They don't need nectar. but they pollinate flowers the same way.

They crawl inside, pollen sticks to their legs and gets brushed off the next flower they visit.

- Can they make honey?

- Uh... No.

I was joking.

How do they know where the flowers even are? I mean...

Well, they have a sensor.

Like a... camera?

No. Just a basic visual sensor.

You see, they need rudimentary pattern recognition in order to locate compatible flora and navigate.

- They navigate?

- Yes.

You don't... I don't know... steer them?

They're autonomous.

That's right, isn't it?

They make their own decisions.

They look after themselves.

Yes. You see, the ADIs cover the whole of the UK.

We couldn't command each one individually ourselves.

It's just not logistically possible.

No. [coughs] We simply set the behaviour and leave them to it.

They even construct these hives themselves.

They reproduce...

- They reproduce?

- Yes. Each hive is a replication point.

- [Blue] It's like a 3D printer, basically.

- [Rasmus] Exactly.

They create duplicates of themselves, create more hives and spread out exponentially.

- [Blue] Cover the country.

- Maybe you should work here.

Yeah, well, I read up on it.

It's impressive.

It is. It's just a shame it's necessary.

The alternative would have been environmental catastrophe.

Bees were dying out.

So, what is it that brings you here?

We think one of your ADIs may be involved in an unexplained death.

Sorry? A death?

Uh-huh.

Thank you.

Yeah. It's one of ours.

But, look, these are not designed to...

Kill people? I'd hope not.

Could it have malfunctioned somehow?

No. I mean, when they do malfunction...

It happens, but then they just break, they just hit the ground.

What if someone hacked one and then they found a way of controlling it?

That's impossible.

You see, it's got military-grade encryption, and you would need a diagnostic controller, which is also encrypted.

So I would say the likelihood is...

I don't know what he's saying, but it's not the same as "impossible."

This is every hive we have online.

See...

These are the hives in the building here.

- How many bees per hive?

- Around 4,000.

- [Karin] It's like air traffic control.

- [Rasmus] Yeah.

Is that the search input?

- Yeah, but, uh... you'd need...

- Sorry.

[tapping on keyboard]

- Jo Powers' postcode.

- [beeping]

Is that who this is about?

- You said you get some malfunctions?

- A fair few, yes.

They smack into a car or something.

We even had people trap them.

You know, put them in the microwave for YouTube videos. [laughs]

And this logs any that drop off the system?

Logs everything, yes.

Did you lose any around here on Monday evening?

Well, I can check.

[beeping]

Just one. Went out at 1903 hours.

Here, I can replay.

[beeping]

There.

- That's odd.

- [Blue] What's odd?

When they pass between hives, they switch from one jurisdiction to another.

- It's, you know, like a...

- It's like a phone between cell masts?

Exactly. It tried to do that, but there was nothing to switch to.

Unless someone spoofed a hive and then they've used that to commandeer your ADI.

No, you would need a diagnostic controller to do that.

[Blue] What's the range on one of those?

[Rasmus] Ten, 20 metres, perhaps.

So whoever was controlling it would have to be no more than 20 metres away.

- Outside the house.

- Yeah. Sitting in a car, even.

- Can you trace back who did this?

- Yes. I-I'm already trying to do that.

Uh...

You know what? Uh...

It would be easier without an audience.

Okay.

You two swap numbers, keep a line of communication.

Can you shut the whole thing down if need be... hypothetically speaking?

Even a short stoppage would damage the ecosystem, and we'd need approval from the Department of the Environment.

We'll need a list of any Granular staff that had access to that system, past or present.

[laughs] Some were government employees.

Use a different font for those if it helps.

Bye.

[buzzing]

[buzzing]

Nick, that's a set of Granular personnel records.

Root out anyone interesting.

Maybe not just one.

Could be a group involved.

Technically we should refer this up to the NCA, but there's no fucking way they're taking this off me.

The NCA already knows about it.

What?

DCI Karin Parke?

- Yes.

- Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.

[Karin] How come you're here?

There's been more than one.

This is Tusk, last night.

- Shit.

- They thought it was a fit.

Took him to the hospital.

He had to be anaesthetised to stop him mutilating himself.

X-ray seemed to indicate some kind of plaque or tumour in his brain

- so they popped him in the MRI.

- [groans]

Yeah. Basically one big magnet.

Tore it right out of his head, through the eye socket.

[groans]

Battered the ADI too.

Yours is more intact so I'm gonna need it for analysis.

[Karin] It's evidence.

Two's a pattern. It knocks any malfunction theory in the head.

- And they're similar victims.

- Similar?

Both in the middle of online shit storms.

Well, if you wanna kill someone, there's a million easier ways to do it.

Pull this off and you've done it from across the street.

No fingerprints, no DNA.

It's like wishing them dead.

Fuck.

Fuck.

Guys? Come here.

Okay, so, um... Jo Powers and Tusk, both were being kicked around the Internet for hours, but in both their cases, people were also tweeting their photos accompanied with this hashtag: DeathTo.

- Like our friend the teacher.

- Right.

She didn't know where she'd first heard of it, but trace it back, and it looks like the first real use of the hashtag was last weekend.

- By who?

- [Blue] Uh...

Looks like, um...

Looks like identical tweets from a set of duplicate bot accounts.

Um...

Automated. It's like spam.

This is someone trying to seed the tag, you know? Get it out there.

It's like bait. This is someone wanting people to pick up on it.

Check out the senders' avatar photos.

[Karin] Bees. Shit.

Okay.

There's more.

So each tweet had a sort of instruction video attached to it.

- [Karin] Uh-huh.

- There.

"Game of Consequences"?

It's like an unpopularity contest.

Pick someone you don't like and if enough other people choose the same name, then that's who gets targeted.

Here, watch.

[man] Game of Consequences.

- One: Pick a target.

- [Karin] Oh, my God.

Two: Post their name and photo with DeathTo.

No.

Three: Most popular target will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.

Four: Game resets at midnight.

- [Nick] Oh, no.

- [Karin] Fuck.

Someone's holding a public ballot, bumping off the top person.

- Jesus, it's just mad.

- Yeah, and it's growing.

Day one. 63 people used the hashtag on Jo Powers, okay?

On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.

- Who's using it now?

- There's... There's loads more people.

There's quite a few votes for the Chancellor.

- Yeah.

- Um...

But at number one... is 880 people using it on someone called Clara Meades.

- Who's she?

- Clara Meades.

Okay, um... it looks like she was at a demo, and she took a selfie in front of a war memorial.

- Pretending to piss on it.

- Nice work, Clara.

Yeah, it's getting near the end of the vote, and her mentions are blowing up.

- Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?

- Um, no.

So people can't know the hashtag works.

They're using it to scare her.

- Yeah, but they're gonna get her killed.

- We need to get to her before five.

Yeah. Pulling her citizens details.

You're not supposed to have access to that.

Yeah, I know. Just getting her location.

There.

[breathes heavily]

[computer chirrups repeatedly]

[phone ringing]

[ringing stops, chirruping continues]

\_

\_

\_

\_

[sighs]

- \_

- [phone rings]

\_

\_

[woman] Hello?

[whimpers]

[woman] Yeah, she is.

All right, all right, hold on.

Clara!

Police. For you.

How did they get my number?

- Hello?

- Clara Meades?

This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.

Sorry to track you down like this, but we think you may be in danger.

Sorry, is this a joke? Because all this stuff I'm getting is not funny.

I'm not joking.

Stay where you are until we get there.

And keep your windows closed.

I'm setting up a perimeter.

Call Rasmus, we need him across this.

[sighs]

- Rasmus?

- Hi, Blue.

I'm sending you a postcode and my GPS.

I need you to monitor the area.

Track my location and see if you get anything unusual, any rogue ADIs, yeah?

Yeah, great, good.

Look, if they come back,

I think I can catch them.

I have basically set a trap.

So if they... if they try it again, we've got them.

- Are you Batman?

- They only just rolled them out.

This'll turn every red light between here and there to green.

Fuck me. If this is the NCA life,

I should apply for a transfer.

Let's go.

\_

We can take her here.

It's a safe house for terrorist informers usually.

[helicopter whirring]

[sirens wailing]

[man over radio] No target sighted.

[man over loudspeaker]

This is a police operation!

Everybody vacate their premises now.

Please leave...

[gasps]

[computer pings]

- [Vanessa] What's that?

- [Rasmus] Someone's trying to break in.

- Rasmus?

- I just picked up an attempted breach.

Granular, they've got a breach.

- [Rasmus] One ADI just went offline.

- Where?

- 800 metres from your location.

- That's outside our cordon.

If someone's trying to pilot it this way, they're gonna turn 'round the moment they see all these uniforms.

Clara Meades? I'm Karin Parke.

Did you pack a bag?

- Yeah, it's by the door.

- Right, let's go.

- Rasmus got a track on them?

- Not yet.

[beeping] \_

It's just precautionary, and it's only for one night.

Just gotta call in.

Hi.

No, not yet.

Hopefully never. Granular are onto it.

- Understood.

- [buzzing]

They housed a witness here for a while,

Shaun said.

- Must've had kids.

- Have you got kids?

[both] No.

No plans.

[buzzing]

Up the stairs.

[phone rings]

- Rasmus.

- Still nothing. I can't trace it.

[sighs]

[sighs] At least there's an en-suite.

- Is there nothing?

- [Rasmus] No.

Whoever it is, they've masked their path well.

[beeping]

But that's not...

- Fuck.

- [Blue] What?

- We just lost a whole hive.

- What does that mean?

Packed full of ADIs.

Lost them all too.

- No... Rasmus?

- There's thousands of them.

- Where?

- It's close to your location. [static]

Rasmus, say that again.

Blue? Blue. It's close...

It's very close to you.

Text it. Text it to me.

Rasmus. Text it to... [static] Shit.

Do I get to redecorate?

[buzzing]

- [crackling on line]

- Hello. Hello.

[distorted voice]

[beeping]

[Rasmus] No...

They've got the whole thing.

We're not in control anymore.

- They've got the whole thing.

- [Vanessa] What are you doing?

- Fix it! Can't you fix it?

- Shut up!

[crackling on line]

[buzzing]

[buzzing continuing]

- [screams]

- [phone beeps]

\_

[buzzing]

Shit.

[panting]

We need to go. Now. Now! Come on!

[buzzing]

Go. Go, go, go.

[Shaun screams]

[loud buzzing]

[gasps]

[Clara] What's... what's happening?

[buzzing]

- [rattling]

- [Blue] Karin...

- [rattling]

- [mutters]

[loud buzzing]

In there! Go!

[gasps]

- Help me block the gap!

- [Clara]Tell me what's going on!

You're scaring the shit out of me!

[loud buzzing]

[door rattles]

[gasps]

[buzzing and rattling continue]

- [rattling]

- [screams]

Oh! Fuck!

[buzzing]

- [buzzing]

- [screams]

[buzzing]

The fan! The fan! [screams]

[screams]

[screams]

Get it away from me!

[screams]

[screams hysterically]

[gasps]

[buzzing]

[buzzing stops]

[panting]

[woman] Take your time.

I'd seen so many bodies before.

At crime scenes, in autopsies.

But I'd never seen anyone die.

And she was right there.

And can you describe the reaction of your colleague, Miss Colson?

Blue took it hard.

[Shaun] Uh-huh.

[man] I'll shut it down.

We thought this was one guy, some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity, hijacking one ADI and personally controlling it.

[Shaun] But there were thousands of them.

- So it can't be that, right?

- No.

- One person can't fly hundreds at once.

- No.

Whoever this is, they're controlling the whole system.

- Do you know where from?

- Could be anywhere.

You need to fucking sort this out!

[kicks table]

How do the ADIs know who to target?

Could've found Clara the same way you did, the identity database?

No. That just gives you the basic area.

We were in the room too, and they only went for her.

Facial recognition.

It's got to be facial recognition.

Which means the feed from their visual sensors, that's been accessed too.

- [Shaun] That's not possible.

- [Blue] It's the only explanation.

Now look, the visual feed is secure between each ADI and the hive.

- There you go.

- Although... one of the government's conditions for backing the project...

Okay. Enough.

We had to consent to permitting government security services access to the visual feed at times of quote, "increased national security."

Which is, as I understand it, pretty much all the time.

- I wasn't happy about it.

- Your lot went along with it.

That implies a greater range of options than your lot presented.

- So they are spying on us.

- This is all classified.

So what did you do, did you put in a back door and route it through GCHQ?

I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.

So what don't you have your fucking noses in?

Look, millions of those things flying around, propping up the ecosystem?

Well, that's great, save the planet, hallelujah!

Government's not going to pump billions into it just 'cause some lab coat says so, and it grabs 200 green votes.

They saw an opportunity to get more, they took it.

Total nationwide surveillance.

We tracked suspects for weeks in ways they couldn't dream of.

- We prevented bombings, mass shootings.

- By spying on the public.

And keeping them safe, which is what they want.

Clara Meades isn't safe, though, is she, Shaun?

Knowing what you knew, that might've helped us, but no, you kept your little fucking secret.

Okay! The government's a cunt.

We knew that already.

Word's going to get out about Clara.

The public's going to wake up and find this mental assassination game going on, and soon we're going to have another body.

- So what do we do?

- I don't know.

We're totally locked out. Totally blind.

If I can work out how they got in,

I might be able to reverse engineer some means of getting control back.

Do the ADIs have a command log, on-board cache?

- Yeah, but that's encrypted.

- I'll need the key to that.

[phone rings]

[sighs]

Been through the employee files, found some POIs.

Bring them in.

Are you sitting in on these?

Granular interviews?

I've got to be somewhere.

[radio beeping]

[woman on radio] It's 7:15.

Three deaths have now been linked to a hashtag circulating on social media.

Controversial journalist Jo Powers...

[man on radio] Good morning.

Have you posted the hashtag?

Is it real or an urban myth?

Well, thousands have been taking part, but how culpable are they?

People are dying, and we want to hear your thoughts.

Line seven, Liana...

This is real, this is happening...

I am happy to see her die.

[woman] It's not the hashtag killing them.

That's just a game.

Like, if you're an arsehole, you deserve to be shamed.

[man on radio] Steve, line five.

[man] Yeah, but my point is, someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?

So why not make it someone, you know, who deserves it, like a racist.

[woman] With the hashtag, I've seen celebrities, politicians, everyone.

This doesn't mean you have to sit there encouraging people to take part.

The point is this is already happening.

And people know that they can jump onboard because nobody will ever know if they did or didn't.

Well, let's just pause for a moment and go back to that top five.

As we have been saying, the Chancellor is at number one, and I want us to think about that.

What does that tell us about the choice of the nation?

[woman] Well, I can't say I'm surprised that he's number one on the list.

He's been pretty unpopular for quite a long time now.

[interviewer] But does that warrant his place on this list?

[woman] I'm saying people don't have to think too hard about it.

Now that's he's number one, that should generate more discussions and probably more votes.

\_

Thanks for your time.

- No good?

- No good.

- Well, that's all fascinating...

- Shaun.

- But when do we shut it down?

- Tom.

Forgive me for being sceptical about your agency's basic competence.

- Tom.

- I'm on the fucking chopping block here.

Number one on the list.

The people's fucking choice!

Farrington's number four, and he's a paedophile.

- Suspected paedophile.

- He did it. You know he did.

Let's just shut it down. All social media.

The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug.

Just for today, at least until Thumbelina here pulls his finger out and he actually catches someone.

I wouldn't advise shutting things down.

- But it's possible? We can do that?

- The whole of social media?

- Yeah. Pull a North Korea on it.

- Well, yes, technically.

- Right, so push the off switch.

- [Shaun] That's not a good idea.

- No?

- Not in my opinion.

Right, okay. It's just that speaking as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ.

If we shut it down, you'll still be number one.

Guaranteed to be, in fact.

He's right. If we let it run on, at least there's a few hours.

Anything could happen before five o'clock.

The vote might change.

Yeah, and it might not.

What about that report? The archive job?

From 1985, that memo about Farrington?

- That was over an unrelated matter.

- [Tom] Leak it.

Tom, that would be a smear.

A head-to-toe shit smear,

I fucking hope so.

He's in his 80s. He's had his life.

Fuck him under the bus.

If I could suggest an alternative?

We move you to a safe location.

- Have you secured before five.

- Worked out well for you last night.

I'll show you.

This next one's Tess Wallender.

She was a junior.

So not much in the way of technical skills.

- Quit Granular for personal reasons.

- Nervous exhaustion, yeah.

Worked in Human Resources for Granular until she quit.

She took a photo of a guy on the Tube, said he'd harassed her, lewd comments or something.

Turned out he had a learning disability so she caught a ton of shit on...

On social media.

- Hello. I'm DCI Karin Parke.

- Hi.

\_

It was like having a whole weather system turn against me.

Just hate message after hate message, around the clock, all piling on.

It's hard to describe what that does to your head.

Suddenly there's a million invisible people, all talking about how they despise you.

It's like a mental illness.

Fuck.

[Nick] What?

Shit.

I mean, hands up, I made a mistake, but the way people enjoyed kicking me, that's what got to me.

The casual fun they had and, um...

I just felt I couldn't go on.

Who found you?

Um... Garrett, my flatmate.

He found me in the bath five minutes after I'd slashed them.

I mean, it's crazy.

I'm half-conscious.

He's dragging me out of the bath, and I'm telling him to get out, saying, "I'm naked."

He tied towels 'round my wrists, kept me conscious, kept stroking my hair till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.

Sort of weird.

I think he always had a thing for me.

And we worked at the same place so, you know... awkward.

- He worked at Granular?

- Yeah. On the ADI thing.

- He was a real wunderkind. Ultra-smart.

- What did you say his name was?

Garrett. Garrett Scholes.

Garrett Scholes.

We need the whereabouts of a Garrett...

Scholes. We were about to tell you.

It was buried in the on-board memory of the Jo Powers' ADI.

- What was?

- A manifesto. A 98-page manifesto.

\_

And check this out.

There's fucking selfies in it.

[buzzing]

[man] So we're good to go?

[buzzing]

Okay, that's the charge in place.

Okay. Pull back.

We're all set here.

Detonate.

[explosion]

So, the plan is, we move you to an underground bunker, knock out every hive within a ten-mile radius.

And, what, just leave me there?

How long for?

It's a temporary measure.

How long till you take out all the hives?

There's 20,000, 30,000 of them.

That would take two years.

Two years, a victim a day.

More to the point, the environmental impact would...

Fuck that.

[man] Shit!

- What?

- Fuck!

Stay back, stay back!

Get back!

[buzzing]

[men screaming]

Go, go, go! Get away!

[men screaming]

For fuck's sake, move!

[static, buzzing]

What's your Plan B?

[buzzing]

He was on the original employee roster, but we discounted him.

He left the country six months ago.

We thought we were looking for someone nearby.

Run a full trace on him.

Everything we can find.

Lunatic with production values, that's the worst kind.

"Thanks to the technological revolution, we have the power to rage and accuse, spout bile without consequence.

Only by being forced to recognize the power technology grants us, to acknowledge individual responsibility..."

Is it all like this?

He likens the population to insects, says we revel in cruelty, that it's a weakness that should be bred out of us.

Recurrent theme is he wants people to face the consequences of what they say and do.

- Wants to force that on them.

- The whole thing's a moral lesson?

He wanted us to find this and spread it about.

Well, fuck him.

\_

_

Fuck.

_

\_

Shit.

Karin. Karin. He's messed up.

He's put this document together himself, right?

His author name's in the metadata.

But he stripped out everything else, so we don't know when he's written it, for example.

Mm-hmm.

Most of the photos are clipart off the Internet, except this one.

- The selfie.

- That's where he's screwed up.

He's taken it with his phone, and the phone left a geotag on the image.

- So you know where he took this?

- I know precisely where.

He's here and Granular HQ is there.

There. The forge.

[gasps]

[Karin] Nice one.

Half the drives I sifted in forensics had scorch marks on 'em.

- [Blue] What do you think?

- Yeah. Looks like his toolkit.

- You can use it?

- Pretty much the key to the door.

So you can get control back?

Send the deactivation?

[Rasmus] Well, I've got his source code.

- I should be able to bounce him out.

- Be quick.

[Karin] Key to the door?

Our guy doesn't seem the type to leave keys lying around.

Well, I'm in.

Okay. Deactivate her.

- Yeah, I need to repair permissions.

- Fucking hell.

That's weird.

What's weird?

- [Shaun] Time's ticking.

- That file. Wasn't there before.

- This file?

- Yeah.

[computer beeps]

What is it?

- Blue?

- I think they're IMEI numbers.

What does that mean?

Every phone, every device has a unique number, an IMEI number.

It tethers it to a unique user.

- Yeah.

- But I can check, just... reverse lookup.

[Rasmus] Take it easy.

[Karin] Who are these people?

[Blue] I don't know.

There's 387,000 of them.

Are these IDs your spooks have been collecting?

- No! Are you ready yet?

- Yeah, almost there.

Wait. Wait.

What was the name of that teacher?

Hate cake.

- Liza. Liza Bahar.

- Liza Bahar.

[Shaun] Fuck's sake.

This is a list of everyone who's used the hashtag.

What?

Everyone who took part in the Game of Consequences.

They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ by the looks of it.

That backdoor worked both ways, it seems.

- See if I'm on there.

- What?

I posted the tag earlier with Scholes' face.

- Just trying to get a reaction from him.

- Yeah, yeah, almost there.

[Blue] Yeah, you're there.

[Rasmus] Almost there.

Why has he collected everyone who took part? I mean...

[Rasmus] Okay. I'm ready.

- Shit.

- Run it now.

No. Think. He left us a trail.

- Oh, come on.

- That photo with the whereabouts, it's too big a mistake for him.

He knew we'd do this.

- Now we're shutting it down, all right?

- And maybe that'll trigger some endgame, something to do with that list.

What if those are his real targets?

The people on the list.

Everyone who took part.

Consequences.

The hate figures were the bait.

The players are the target.

- Run the deact command.

- [Rasmus] Now just wait a minute, okay?

- Run it.

- [Karin] No!

[beeping] \_

[gasps]

[beeping]

[Rasmus] Yeah. [laughs]

Yeah, it worked.

[Shaun sighs]

Sorry, but that needed doing. [laughs]

[beeping]

- No, no, no, no, no.

- [Karin] What?

No. No.

- [Rasmus] Fuck!

- [Karin] No.

[Karin] Shit.

Oh, no.

[woman] We're all tragically familiar with the rest of the events of that week.

And we need no reminding of the sheer scale of the loss of life that followed.

No. No, we don't.

[woman] And what became of Ms. Colson?

I think she blamed herself.

No. I know she did.

She felt she'd followed his breadcrumb trail and sprung the whole thing.

She left the force.

I didn't hear from her.

Rang her, tried emailing, but no response.

Then, um...

About four months later, they found her things.

On a beach.

With a note.

She killed herself?

Just whatever they say and once youve done that, youre out.

They let you off.

Hello?

Del... Delivery.

Wrong room.

They said 121.

No, theres no delivery here.

- But they said...

- I havent ordered anything.

Its a cake.

- What cake?

- I dont know. I think its a sponge.

I didnt order a cake so just take it back to the bakery

- and tell them they got it wrong.

- Look, if I...

I dont want the cake.

So go away or I call the front desk.

I will kick that cake up your fucking arse.

- I was just told to give this to you.

- Mindy told you?

- No.

- You said "Mindy."

- Thats what they told me to say.

Get inside.

So what are you saying?

Are you saying Mindy ordered the cake?

No, uh, I dont know.

It... they... it was them.

Them? They? Who the fuck are you on about?

- The people.

- What fucking people?

The phone people.

The people on the phone.

They told me to bring the cake, and theyre leaving texts on my phone,

- and then I do what they say.

- Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

Just breathe through your nose.

Through your nose. Okay?

Good. Now, just show me what they said. On your phone.

- Show me the text.

- Okay, well, um... This.

- I should...

- Shut up. Just let me.

What the fuck is this?

- Who are these people?

- I dont know.

- Who are you?

- Im not them.

They send me messages, and I do what they say.

Why? Why would you do that?

Is it them?

- They said I had to do that.

- Jesus Christ!

Okay, okay.

Theyre saying they just need us to follow their instructions, and everything will be okay. Okay?

Shit!

Theyre saying we have to do it together.

- What do we have to do?

- Just take the cake somewhere.

They sent me an address.

A map coordinate thing.

- And theres a car we need to get.

- A car? What sort of car?

I dont know what sort of car.

They said its in the car park outside.

They sent me a licence plate.

Thats all I know.

Why both of us?

I dont know!

Just let me deal with my fucking shoe, please.

What have they said?

They say, "Go with him.

Take the package."

Okay.

"V760 DHM."

V760 DHM.

Im getting fucking number blindness here.

Thats it.

All right. They said the keys are on the back. Okay.

Look, maybe you better drive. Do you drive?

- I mean, I had a drink back there.

- I cant. I can... I can drive.

Im still learning.

Havent passed my test yet.

All right. Uh... Youre navigating.

Okay, youve got a sat nav on your phone?

Yep.

Here it is. Punch that in.

Its a street somewhere out of town.

Sort of High Wycombe-ish.

They said we got to be there by two.

Its gonna be tight.

So Im guessing they got some shit on you that theyre threatening to put out?

With me, its...

You saw the room, fucking lacy knickers.

I was waiting for a prostitute.

Escort, hooker, whatever they call them now.

I got a family, which is great.

You get bored.

I mean, when I was young, I used to like...

I cant fucking justify it.

I just wanted to fuck a 20-something.

For old times sake, I dont know.

I joined this website. I was curious.

Just wanted to see what was on there.

I got talking to Mindy, who I thought was Mindy.

I mean, she sent me pictures.

I sent some back.

Phone photos. Grabbing my cock.

You name it.

They got the whole fucking thing.

But not just pictures, chat messages.

All the arrangements, where and when.

Me haggling over the price and they say they got it all.

Sucked up the whole hard drive like an audit.

Fucking twat. What a fucking idiot!

If that shit gets out, thats my wife out the door.

Then theres the kids, shell take them.

Oh, no, not a doubt in my mind shed take them and shed win.

Custody, shed win.

And Im not losing my kids.

I tell you that right now.

No way! Absolutely fucking no!

They filmed me.

- Filmed you...

- Through my computer camera.

- What, like, filmed you?

- Yeah, like, you know, doing it.

- Like sex?

- No. Like, you... you know.

Jerking off. Jerking off to porn or something?

Well, everyone does that.

- The fucking pope probably does that.

- Theyre gonna put it everywhere.

Like theyre gonna send it to everyone.

- Oh, shit the fuck!

- What? What?

- What light?

Whoevers car this is, they left it fucking empty.

Hat and sunglasses.

No ones going to ID you.

You could be Kevin fucking Bacon.

Thats point one.

Shut up!

Point two, in a robbery, staff are trained.

I am not...

They are trained to hand over the cash.

No argument. I saw it in a documentary.

No resistance. It looked easy.

Its not easy.

I know it isnt easy, but what the fuck else are we gonna do? Hey?

This gets out, I will lose my kids.

And I swear to God,

I will stand in the kitchen and put a fucking bread knife through my throat if that happens.

- I only looked at pictures and...

Thats what they got, yeah?

Your hot little face, blurred fist, dick burping fucking spunk everywhere?

Your mums gonna love that on Facebook,

Twitter, Insta-fucking-whatever.

And her friends. All eyes on you, giving it that.

Toss in the cunts at work, calling you Spurty McGoo.

Laughing at your come face, making it their desktop wallpaper.

Its not just weeks.

Were talking years here.

Pictures hang about on Google like a gypsy fucking curse.

Theres no cure for the Internet.

It would never go away.

Itd be glued to your name, a fucking stain on you.

Id hang myself if that was me.

Crack my fucking neck at the first opportunity.

They just want the money, so go in there and do it.

Im gonna be sat here with the engine running.

I cant. I cant.

- You can. You can.

- I cant. I cant. I cant. I cant.

- You can.

We dont have much time, Kenny.

- [bangs machine] Damn it!

- Oh, no.

Thank you.

I just wanna get my bearings a bit.

Uh... okay.

- Mm-hmm.

Go along with whatever I say.

- Sorry?

- Whatever I say, go along with it.

Okay, Wes, you're just pestering now.

- Do I have to red light you?

- Two hours 35.

- There's not much time left.

- Wes.

[Wes] Look...

- Last week, we had the most amazing...

- Last week was last week.

I need to talk with my friend here, okay?

Haven't seen her in a while.

Wes, she's sick.

Like "six months to live" sick.

Five, actually.

I need to catch up with her.

Private time.

Okay.

Okay.

- Hey, I'm sorry.

- That's okay.

See you around?

Sure.

Sorry for killing you.

Sorry. Five.

- Yorkie.

- Yurgie?

- Yorkie.

Like the dog breed?

Yeah.

He's not a bad guy. I feel kinda bad.

- Met him at the Quagmire so...

- What's the Quagmire?

If you don't already know what the Quagmire is, you probably don't wanna know.

No?

You want another one?

- Oh, no, I...

- Yeah, you do. Come on.

Do I have to tug your leash?

- Hey, Blondie.

- I'm Blondie?

You are. Jack and Coke times two.

- Oh, no. Mine was just a Coke.

- Times two.

- What are you doing?

- I'm... regarding you.

[laughs] I feel like I'm being analysed.

- Why the glasses?

- Um...

I like them. They totally work on you.

But do you need them?

- Yeah, the lenses don't do anything.

- Knew it!

I used to wear them in school.

So I guess now they're just kind of a... comfort thing.

I figured they were kind of a fashion statement.

- Really?

- But then the rest of your outfit is not.

Don't take that wrong.

It's refreshing. I mean, look around.

People try so hard to look how they think they should look.

They probably saw it in some movie.

But I like these.

You're authentically you.

Thanks.

Cheers.

- [clears throat]

- You never tasted it before?

No, I...

I just haven't had it in a while.

It's good.

- No. Oh, uh...

- Tourist?

We'll go with tourist.

So you're new here?

- First night.

- First night? Wow, okay!

["Fake" by Alexander O'Neal playing]

Oh, my God! [laughs]

We have to dance to this.

- With each other?

- Uh-huh.

- Oh, no. Dance floors aren't my thing.

- Oh, let's not limit ourselves.

- No, I can't.

- Yes, you can, come on.

- No, I'll look dumb...

- Just follow my lead!

[music resumes]

[man shouts]

Hey!

- Why did you run away?

- Oh, sorry.

I... I said I'm not much of a dancer.

No shit.

Like a frightened horse on a frozen lake back there.

I'm kidding. Half kidding.

Sorry I pushed you into it.

Saturday nights once a week.

It's like no time. I get impatient.

No, no, it's not that. It's...

- Everyone was looking.

- Looking?

Yeah. You know, two girls dancing.

Okay, one, folks are way less uptight than they used to be.

And two, this is a party town.

No one's judging.

Face it. If they were staring, it's because I am bodacious.

[laughs]

- You're stupid.

- Thank you!

- I've never been on a dance floor.

- Never?

As in the whole time you've been alive never?

- Never.

- [laughs]

What are you, like, Amish?

That's one sheltered existence you got there.

Yeah, well.

As far as my family's concerned,

I can't do anything.

Well, no one knows about even half the shit I get up to.

With your folks, though, it's from a place of love, though, right?

- They worry.

- They don't worry.

Just the concept of me enjoying myself would blow their minds.

What would you like to do?

That you've never done?

Oh...

So many things.

San Junipero is a party town.

All up for grabs.

Midnight's two hours away.

Oh, that's not long.

Why waste time sitting here?

I, um...

- Listen...

- It's okay.

- No, I mean...

- Really, it's okay.

No, I'm, uh...

I'm engaged. I have a fiancé.

- He's called Greg.

- And is Greg here?

- No, he's...

- Elsewhere?

Yeah.

Oh.

Wanna go to bed with me?

We could be back at mine in like...

[snaps fingers]

I never did anything like that.

All the more reason.

Oh, you're nice.

- I can't.

- Okay.

- I just... I can't.

- I get it.

- I have to go.

- In this?

It's been really great to meet you.

Likewise.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Shit.

- I'm red lighting you, for real. Okay?

- No, don't do that. Just...

- Then stop this.

- Can you hear me out? Please? Please.

How many girls do you think there are in San Junipero?

Hundreds? Thousands?

I don't care.

I'm saying there's plenty of other girls out there for you, Wes.

The locals? They're like dead people.

- [whooping]

- A little lively for dead people.

Look, I don't want some kind of boring romance, okay?

Like, Jesus, put us in a retirement home deal.

Well, if you're looking for someone to fuck, there's options.

- Hang out at the Quagmire again.

- It's not just sex.

- It was just sex.

- No, we made a connection.

Wes, it was just sex.

- No...

- No roots.

We had fun.

I'm sorry.

Enjoy the town, for God's sake.

["Living In A Box" by Living In A Box playing]

- Hey.

- Hey.

Waiting for someone?

Not really.

I'll get you a drink?

[Kelly] Uh, yeah, sure.

So, uh... yeah, it was microsurgery, I guess.

You know, both my kneecaps had kind of just worn down.

You know, I never got this song.

Kind of weird.

- Shall we dance?

- Sure.

[door closes]

- I don't know how to do this.

- Do what?

Just help me.

Can you just...

Just make this easy for me?

You wanna get in my car?

[engine revs]

- How long have you been here?

- Sorry?

- How long have you been here?

- In San Junipero?

Uh... Couple of months.

Plan is long enough to enjoy myself.

Guess I'm a tourist, like you.

Yeah.

Hey. You okay?

Yeah.

- [horn honking]

- [screams] Stop!

[tyres screech]

[thuds]

[both pant]

Sorry, but...

[laughs] Man, your face!

[laughing]

Wow.

- You like it?

- It's just so big.

Reminds me of where I grew up.

Miss your mom?

[moaning]

[gasps] You have to show me.

- Okay.

- Okay.

You never slept with a woman before?

That's not a critique.

I mean, it was fucking awesome.

No, never with a woman.

Never with anyone.

Not anyone?

- What, in town or...?

- No. No one, nowhere.

- I guess you deflowered me.

- I deflowered you?

What is this? Merry England?

[laughs] Shut up.

You've had relationships though.

Mnh-mnh.

Hello! You got a fiancé.

- It's complicated.

- Yeah, I'll say.

When did you know...

- that you liked women?

- I like men too.

Equal rights.

Okay.

But when did you know?

Do you always know?

I was married to a guy.

A long time, I was married.

I always knew.

I mean, I'd be attracted to other girls, co-workers, friends, some waitress that served me.

They were crushes.

God, they were crushes.

Never acted on any of it.

Never did anything.

I was in love with him.

I really was in love with him.

But he chose not to stick around.

So now it's me.

And I'm passing through.

And before I leave,

I'll have a good time.

I'm just gonna have a good time.

Time's nearly up.

Then let's lie here.

- Do you know where to find her?

- How would I know that?

- You're her friend.

- Was a friend.

- Has she been here?

No.

[laughs] You too, huh?

Well...

Hey. Try a different time.

Here in '80, the '90s, 2002 one time.

She's worth the shot, right?

Introducing the totally redesigned

Chrysler Cordoba.

All the luxury you expect is here.

But so is gas mileage...

[woman] No, no, no.

Why are you here?

I was looking for you.

Where did you go?

I like a change of music.

How the hell is this your era?

- You hid from me.

- One, I did not.

Two, I owe you zero.

And three... see point two.

It's not about who owes who.

It's about manners.

You don't know who I am.

You don't know what this means.

This means fun.

Or it should. And this...

This is not fun, okay?

This is not fun.

So you don't feel bad?

Maybe you should feel bad.

Or at least feel something.

[glass shatters]

[horn honks]

Have you seen a girl?

Mid-20s, brown hair, glasses?

Uh...

Oh, jeez.

Hey.

Please tell me you got your pain slider set to zero.

Yeah, I think so.

- Okay, listen.

- How many of them are dead?

Like what percentage?

As in full-timers?

[Kelly] Eighty. Eighty-five.

I'm sorry.

- I'm not gonna jump.

- I know, and I'm sorry, whatever it's...

In the time I've been here,

I said I wouldn't...

I don't know, do feelings.

You freaked me out.

I don't want to like anyone.

So you've been just... totally fucking inconvenient.

It's that...

I don't know how long there is.

And I can't. I wasn't prepared for you.

For wanting something...

[sighs] Next week it is.

I'm getting married.

Next week?

- To nice Greg?

- [laughs]

- Sure you're going through with that?

- I have to.

- You have to?

- Mm-hmm.

He really is a good guy.

I mean, my family don't approve, but... they can't stop us.

I know he pities me. That pisses me off.

- But that's not fair 'cause he's...

- [shushes]

You said you don't know how much time there is.

What does that mean?

They tell me three months.

It's spread basically everywhere.

They said three months before six months ago.

So, you know, what do they know?

Doesn't even taste of anything.

- But so you'll stay here after?

- No.

When I'm done, I am done.

But that's cra... I mean...

- Why?

- Richard.

That's...

My husband's name was Richard.

He died just two years ago.

So we had the opportunity to stay in San Junipero.

Pass over.

Didn't take it.

- Didn't want to take it.

- Why wouldn't anyone take it?

He had his viewpoint.

There were things he believed and things he didn't believe in, and this place was one of them.

Wouldn't even visit. Take the trial run.

Shit.

I didn't know if I wanted to try it but... I mean...

Jesus, without this place,

I never would've met someone like you.

- Yeah, you could have.

- No, I wouldn't.

- We could have met outside all this.

- No.

You... would not have got me at all.

At all.

If we really met, I mean...

If we really met, you wouldn't like me.

Try me.

Or you'd...

You wouldn't want to spend time with me.

- You'd come and then...

- Try me.

Why?

Why? What's the point?

What? Where are you? Houston?

Carson City, Nevada.

So come on.

I showed you mine.

Where are you?

- I can just look it up.

- Santa Rosa, California.

- That's no distance.

- I don't want you to...

- I don't want you to see me. I'm scared...

- And I'm dying.

Whatever you are can't scare me.

Let me come visit.

I want to say hi.

Here you go.

You okay?

[man over loudspeaker]

Please check in at our self-service pods using swipe cards provided.

- You must be Kelly.

- I guess I must.

- She's waiting for you.

- Thank you.

- Please.

- [beeps]

She won't be able to physically respond in any way.

But she can hear you.

I'll give you some privacy.

[whispers] Hello, stupid.

It's good to see you.

Uh... Hello. Excuse me. Is it... Kelly?

It is.

- I'm Greg.

- You're Greg?

- Holy shit.

- [laughs]

Yeah, I think it's great that you came down here in person before she passes over.

Even her folks don't come visit no more so...

She's passing over?

- When?

- Uh...

- Let's go grab a coffee.

- Okay.

- She didn't tell you?

- No, she did not.

- Said she was just visiting.

- More like sampling the trial version.

I mean, I've only known her the past three years.

We talk on the comm box.

She told you how she ended up quadriplegic?

And how long she's been that way?

One night, she's 21, comes out to her folks.

They're a little uptight about it, you might say.

They told her they don't want a gay daughter.

It's not natural and so forth.

They fight. She gets in her car.

Runs it off the road. Boom!

- When she was 21?

- More than 40 years back.

It's been her whole lifetime, basically.

So the whole San Junipero system has been a big deal for her.

The biggest deal.

Of course now, until she passes over, it goes permanent, she's on a five-hour weekly limit.

I guess you're the same.

They ration it out.

They don't trust us with more.

They say you go crazy if you have too much, you know?

You don't leave your seat.

You disassociate body from mind.

Like that doesn't happen in every senior home already. [laughs]

The system's there for therapeutic reasons, immersive nostalgia therapy.

Plunge you into a world of memories.

Helps with Alzheimer's, that's what they say.

Small mercies.

So...

About this marriage...

The state's got a triple lockdown on euthanasia cases.

You gotta have a sign-off from the doc, the patient, a family member.

It's to stop folks from passing over just because they prefer San Junipero flat out.

Anyhow, Yorkie's family, they're big-time religious, and they will not sign.

But a spouse can override them.

- Hence the wedding bells.

- You got it.

We got a pastor coming tomorrow a.m., and then she's scheduled to pass tomorrow afternoon.

"Scheduled to pass."

Let's just call it dying.

If you can call it dying.

Uploaded to the cloud, sounds like heaven.

I guess.

You gonna wear a suit?

[laughs]

The ceremony's on my coffee break.

I never married so I just figured, you know, what's the harm?

You're a good man.

It's the least I could do, right?

Think you could hook us up to the system now?

Just for a little while, before she passes?

You can still see her afterwards.

I mean, then she's no limit.

She's full, fat, permanent San Juniperan.

I know, but can you?

Seriously, it is so tight here that they monitor every...

I only want a moment.

[Greg] Ma'am.

- You got five minutes

- Thank you.

Hey!

I've never been here during the daylight.

It's warm.

Listen, I gotta be quick.

So I spoke to Greg.

Oh.

- You're passing over tomorrow?

- Yeah.

Couple of hours after the wedding.

So I guess I am technically honeymooning here forever.

- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

- [shushes]

- I'm gonna say something crazy.

- Okay.

Wanna marry me instead?

It's just... Greg seems great, but...

- Why not someone you've connected with?

- [laughs]

- [laughs] Is that a yes?

- [laughs]

[man] ...to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, in good times and in woe, for richer, for poorer...

[beeping]

[Yorkie breathing faintly]

[breathing stops]

[sighs]

[gulls squawking]

[waves rippling]

[sighs]

[nurse] Hold tight.

There you go.

Nearly there.

That's it.

[Kelly coughing]

Are you sure you're all right?

[beeps]

[sighs]

[horn honks]

Hey!

[both laughing]

You didn't dress up to see me?

Oh...

Come on!

- Better?

- [both laugh]

Whoop!

Oh!

Oh! Whoo!

[Yorkie] Looks so real.

It feels so real!

[Kelly laughs]

[laughs and screams]

- What are you doing?

- Oh, I love it here! [laughs]

I just love it.

- You've been here before.

- But now I live here!

Be with me.

- I'm with you now.

- That's not what I mean.

Pass over.

- When it's your time.

- Yorkie.

- Stay here with me.

- Can we just enjoy tonight?

It's almost midnight.

In ten minutes, you're out of here.

Then I gotta wait a week to see you again.

- You know I'm just a visitor.

- What, a couple of months, then what?

- We're not discussing this.

- Then you're gone.

- Just gone. You could have forever.

- Forever?

- Who can even make sense of forever?

- However long you want then.

I mean, you can remove yourself like that. [snaps fingers]

It's not a trap.

I mean, look at it! Jesus! Touch it!

[bangs vehicle]

- I'm going.

- Hey! Oh. Hey.

It's real.

This is real.

And this.

- Hmm?

- Come on.

You know that was just a gesture.

- You married me.

- To help you pass over.

- As a... kindness.

- It's not so kind to leave.

Okay, look, look, I'm sorry, I just...

I got this chance.

We got this chance.

I wanna share it with you.

I said I made my choice.

What is it? You feel bad because your husband isn't here?

- Because that was his choice.

- Don't.

He chose not to stay here.

It's like he left you.

You know, he could have stayed, but he chose to leave you.

- You don't know what you're saying.

- You should be mad at him.

- Not whipping yourself with guilt.

- Get off me.

You can't see it!

But what he did, it was selfish actually!

[gasps]

Forty-nine years...

I was with him for 49 years.

You can't begin to imagine.

You can't know... the bond, the commitment, the boredom, the yearning, the laughter, the love of it.

The fucking love. You just cannot know!

Everything we sacrificed.

The years I gave him.

The years he gave me.

Did you think to ask?

Did it occur to you to ask?

We had a daughter.

Alison.

Always difficult, always beautiful.

Died at 39 years old, bless her heart.

And Richard and I, we felt that heartbreak as one.

You think you're the only person ever suffered, go fuck yourself.

- Well, I didn't know...

- Didn't think to.

You know, when he was dying,

Richard said to me when they offered him this, to pass over, pass through, spend eternity in this fucking graveyard you're so in love with, he said, "How can I?

When she missed out, how can I?"

And so he went.

And I wish I could believe he's with her now, that they're together, but I don't.

I believe they're nowhere.

Just like you said.

Gone. No, I pitied you, and that's the truth. I pitied you.

Now you give me some sales pitch about how fucking peachy forever could be.

I'm sorry.

You wanna spend forever somewhere nothing matters?

End up like Wes?

All those lost fucks at the Quagmire trying anything to feel something, go ahead.

But I'm out. I'm gone.

Kelly, I'm sorry. Kelly!

[engine revs]

[tyres screech]

[engine revs]

- [crashes]

- [Kelly grunts]

[waves ripple]

[coughs]

[chattering]

[nurse] Hey, Kelly.

- You all right?

- Yeah, I am fine.

[wheezes]

- Well, okay then.

- Huh?

Kelly?

All things considered...

I guess I'm ready.

For what?

For the rest of it.

[seagulls cry]

[starts engine]

_ Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth _

_ Ooh, heaven is a place on Earth _

_ They say in heaven love comes first _

_ We'll make heaven a place on Earth _

_ Ooh, heaven is a place on Earth _

_ When I feel alone _

_ I reach for you _

- _ And you bring me home _

- [honks horn]

_ When I'm lost at sea _

- [laughs]

- _ I hear your voice and it carries me _

Ready?

- _ In this world we're just beginning _

- [both] Whoo!

_ To understand the miracle of living _

- _ Maybe I wasn't brave before _

- [both] Whoo!

_ But I'm not afraid anymore _

_ Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth _

_ Ooh, heaven is a place on Earth _

_ They say in heaven love comes first _

_ We'll make a heaven a place on Earth _

_ Ooh, heaven is a place on Earth _

[glass cracks]

[woman] Okay, my people!

Rise and shine. Get up, Stripe.

[banging]

Hey. You awake yet?

-Sure as shit aint dreaming no more.

-[woman] Company!

Something went down last night in Her Falls, a village about three miles east.

Weve got reports of a food store broken into, shit stolen.

Locals think its roaches.

[woman] Roaches!

We head out in five minutes. Lets go!

[claps]

Hey, so, it looks like youre getting your first real-live roach hunt, huh?

[laughs]

[clamoring]

Hey, new!

New!

Its Stripe.

Heres a little tip just in case you get your first toe-to-toe

-with one of them roaches today.

-Uh-huh?

When you see one right here, try not to shit your pants.

Its only gonna piss them off.

-Ill try.

-Try to ignore Len.

His aims so bad, hes the only guy on Earth who could shit his own pants and miss.

-Fuck you, farm girl.

-Farm girl?

[woman] Yeah. Huntings in my blood.

-Some of us are naturals.

-[engine starts]

Moving out!

Whoo! Yeah!

-[baby crying] 

-[chickens clucking]

[soldiers speaking Danish]

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

-You can speak now.

-[robotic voice interpreting]

[speaking Danish]

-[machine] It must have been roaches.

-Roaches, you see them? You see?

-[speaking Danish]

-[machine] I didnt see them.

[machine] I heard them.

All the mess. It must have been them.

-Want a cookie?

-[man speaking Danish]

-Here you go.

-[machine] Theyve been in the food.

[speaking Danish]

[machine] Well have to destroy everything they left.

No one will eat it.

[woman] We can replace that, okay?

[machine interprets]

[man speaking Danish]

[machine] They destroyed the cooler.

Broke it and took the parts.

The cooler?

They stole parts from the cooler?

[machine interprets]

-Which way did they go?

-[machine interprets]

[speaks Danish]

[machine] There were footprints in the dirt leading that way.

-Parn Heidekker.

-[machine beeps]

-Parn Heidekker.

-[machine beeps]

-Heidekker? Is that a name?

-[machine interprets]

Stop them coming. Please, you must stop.

Okay.

I have child who is scared.

I will. I promise.

[whispering in Danish]

[woman] Stripe!

[whispering continues]

Okay. Our friend here thinks that the roaches went in the direction of Parn Heidekkers place.

Local oddball, seems to be some kind of religious freak.

Anderson, Hague, I want you  to stay here and help them torch the food, keep them calm and reassured.

The rest of you, were gonna drop in on Heidekker.

Ask some questions, sniff around the place.

If theres roaches, we show were ready for them. Lets go.

So Mr. Heidekker is not exactly what you call a socialite or a mingler.

Seems like mental health issues.

Hes got some interesting views on roaches, by all accounts.

Im putting his info in your Mass system now.

Been complaints lodged against him going months back.

Locals claim that he let roaches cross his land, left food out for them.

Could be just shit talk from the local villagers though so...

Yo, how many roaches we got left out here?

A couple of thousand?

A couple of hundred, if that?

I mean, back home we had millions, man.

It only took two years to get shit back on track.

Out here you got rustic fucks throwing them scraps.

No wonder its taken so long to mop shit up.

But how can anyone be dumb enough to help a fucking roach?

Hell, yeah.

[whirring]

Portals front and rear.

Windows blacked out.

Chimney smoke. Someones home.

Lennard, you use the boomer.

[cocks gun]

[cocks gun]

Okay, Mass check. Everyone got the layout?

-[woman] Check.

-[man] Check.

Check.

[woman] Aikin, Valcon, Coach, you check the outbuildings here.

Take them one at a time and slow.

Stripe, Raiman, you come with me and Lennard.

We go in here.

Len and I will talk to Heidekker, you check the rest of the house.

Okay.

Optimal outcome, no shots fired.

Except on a roach.

-[woman] Except on a roach.

-[laughs]

[lock turns]

-[woman] Morning, sir.

-[machine interprets]

Theres no need for this.

I speak your language.

Okay.

-What is it you want?

-Just to talk.

Thats what were doing.

Be a little more neighbourly if we did it inside.

Check the upstairs rooms.

[woman] Relax. Im not your enemy.

Where are they?

Where are who?

You know, we got a whole bunch of frightened, angry people in that village.

Roaches have been breaking into the food stores, stealing supplies.

You know anything about that?

No.

[woman]

See, its not just what they stole.

All that food left is gonna be destroyed.

-No ones gonna eat it.

-[whispers] Stripe.

[woman]

Makes life harder for everyone.

Cross on the wall there.

You got principles.

Think all life is sacred. And I get it.

I agree. All life is sacred so... you even got to protect the roaches.

Right?

Its not their fault theyre like that.

They didnt ask for this.

I get it. We get it.

-[door bangs]

-Mm-hmm.

-[door bangs]

-[bird squawks]

[woman] Theres shit in their blood that made them that way.

The sickness theyre carrying.

That doesnt care about the sanctity of life or the pain about who else is gonna suffer.

We dont stop the roaches, in five, ten, 20 years from now, youre still gonna get kids born that way, and then theyre gonna breed.

Bingo.

[woman]

And so it goes on. That cycle of pain.

That sickness, and it could have been avoided.

Fucking roach nest.

You check in there. Ill take the stairs.

[woman] Every roach you save today, you condemn God knows how many people to despair and misery tomorrow.

You cant still see them as human.

Understandable sentiment, granted, but its misguided.

We gotta take them out if humankind is gonna carry on in this world.

Thats just the hard truth.

Gotta make sacrifices.

We gotta listen to Mr. Sunday School all the way back to base?

You can cover your ears.

Yeah, or, uh....

Ill just hit permanent mute.

[woman] Lower your weapon.

[Raiman]

Roach lover counts as a kill too, right?

[Stripe] Hes a civ, right?

You shoot a civ, thats gonna stay with you the rest of your life.

Yo, Stripe, why dont you, uh... pull the stick out of your ass?

Because Im fucking with him, not you.

I guess I had you both going, right?

All right!

Lets torch the place.

[high-pitched whistling]

[Raiman] Hey, you okay, man?

Yeah.

[bird squawks]

-I heard you popped one in there.

-Two.

Wait, two?

-I got another one, with my knife.

-[laughs] With your knife? Holy shit!

-Pretty good, right?

-Yeah, you fucking Terminator.

Damn! First time out, he gets two.

[man] You lucky motherfucker, man.

Sweet dreams for this asshole.

[Raiman] Gonna get a treat tonight.

[Raiman] Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

-Whoa! Miss Sharp Shooter.

Patronising fuck!

Ruthless! Youre the Grim Reaper.

Yeah, well, no roach gets away next time.

Are you still sweating that?

Well, I grew up tracking deer.

You never give up.

I dont like it when they get away.

Nice.

Yeah, if that fucker made it to the forest, probably made it to the border, gone for good.

Yeah. Its all right for you.

You popped two of em.

Its been a while for me.

You know, the gal is getting twitchy.

Come on, Rai.

You sleep good?

Yeah, I slept OK.

What, thats all youre gonna give me?

Okay? You know, if I got two in one go,

I would want to come for like an hour!

All right, shut up. [groans]

All right.

Ah! Thats the way.

-[high-pitched whistling]

[Raiman] Hey, you okay, man?

Yeah, think Im tired is all.

Uh-huh?

[groans]

[soldiers chant]

-Hey, Stripe, you okay?

-Yeah.

I mean, I... dont know.

I feel a little off.

I mean, I aint sick or nothing.

Its just, uh...

Report to the sick bay.

[man] Running diagnostic.

What do you see?

A cube.

[buzzing]

-Rotating?

-Yeah.

-And now?

-A tree.

-Like an apple tree.

-Touch the apples for me.

Full marks.

-So you say you had like a headache?

-Yeah, but just quick.

Nothing big, just...

Well, everything looks okay.

No sign of any malfunction or dropout with your Mass implant.

And physically, youre in exemplary shape.

Youve just seen combat, you can expect some sort of side effect.

There was this, uh... this thing... with a light on it at the farmhouse.

-Roach had it.

-A roach had it?

-Kind of like a flashlight.

-Flashlight?

Kinda.

I dont know.

Seriously, youre fine. Your Mass is fine.

Bloods fine. Its all fine.

Okay. Yeah.

[sighs]

Maybe you should speak to Arquette.

Whos Arquette?

So, you must be Koinanchey?

Koinange. Folks call me Stripe.

Why would they call you that?

Couldnt pronounce Koinange either,

I guess.

[laughs]

-Thats funny.

-Thank you.

At ease, son. Sit down.

So you recently logged your first kills?

-Two roaches?

-Uh-huh.

First time out. Its impressive.

Yeah, I guess.

So what happened?

-What, with the kills?

-Mm-hmm.

Oh. Im in this, uh... farmhouse.

Theres this, like, hidden room or something.

We go in and there they are.

First one, I just... It was automatic.

Just pop-pop, you know?

Right. Just like in training.

[Stripe] Yeah, just like that, yeah. Yeah.

-And the second?

-I mean, he was on the ground with me.

[Arquette] He?

It was a he.

Oh.

So, this was close quarters then?

Yeah, hes on top of me.

Struggling, I mean...

I couldnt reach my rifle so I had to stick him.

Stick it. With my knife.

And how did that... feel?

-What, like...?

-Emotionally.

I didnt. I mean, it was quick.

It was self-protection.

I guess all I felt was, you know, relief.

-Just relief?

-Uh-huh.

Its not unusual to experience other feelings too.

A moment of euphoria even.

Yeah, I guess.

I dont know,

I thought maybe Id feel...

I dont know.

-Something else?

-Yeah, like...

Regret. Something like that, but that just wasnt there.

Hmm.

So youd do it again?

Yeah, sure.

So... why are you here? [laughs]

I dont know. I mean...

I had a few weird moments.

My Mass looked like it was glitching out.

But your implants,

I mean, they passed every diagnostic.

-There is nothing wrong with that?

-Yeah, they said its fine.

I dont know, I think I just...

Felt like something was up with it.

-But theres not.

-No.

[both laugh]

You did a big thing.

You should be proud of yourself.

Okay?

Itll pass.

Lets get you a good sleep tonight, huh?

A real good sleep.

[echoes] Fuck me.

-[chattering]

-Way to go, fuck fingers.

-[scoffs]

It seems Heidekker didnt stay silent too long once we got to work on him.

Hes given up a location, someplace the roaches have been scavenging.

[Raiman] Well, all right.

[woman] Its a housing project thats been empty since the war.

Its not far from here.

So control wants us to do recon before we go back to base.

Can we hurry it up here?

We ought to burn the whole forest down, huh?

Give those roaches nowhere to run.

[whirring]

Okay, you see that?

Solar panel looks cleaner than the rest.

And there are some cables.

-Theres got to be roaches leaching power.

-Why here?

[high-pitched whistling]

Christ knows.

All right.

Better dial it in.

[groans quietly]

[groans]

Control. This is Medina.

Positive ID. Signs of activity here at the housing project location.

Sighted one solar panel, looks recently wiped clean and some cabling.

-Roger so far.

-[sniffing]

-You all right there?

-Smell the grass.

We cant usually smell nothing.

-You ever noticed that?

-[Raiman] No, I never noticed that.

[Medina] Requesting course of action.

Didnt read. Please repeat.

Okay.

Control says we should fall back and await comm--

-[gunfire]

-[Raiman] Shit!

[gunshot]

Medina.

[gunshot]

-[gunshot]

-Oh!

Medina. [panting]

Stripe, get back! Shes dead. Come on!

[Stripe whimpers]

Okay. Ready? Cover me.

Rai! Rai, come on.

Okay.

[whirring]

Oh, fucking roach got a rifle.

Jesus Christ.

Fuck. Piece of shit.

Okay, Stripe.

Stripe, come on. Get it together, dude.

He fired six shots.

His rifle looks old, bolt action.

-Should take him ten seconds to reload.

-We go in?

We go in and take him out.

Are you with me?

-Im with you.

-Lets go!

-[gunfire]

-Follow me!

[Raiman]

Ready? Okay, three, two, one. Cover me.

[high-pitched whistling]

[groans]

[breathes heavily]

[Stripe groans, panting]

-[gunshot]

-Come on, man! What the fuck?

[breathes heavily]

What the fuck is this shit?

Lets go.

[Raiman] Stripe!

[breathes heavily]

[door creaks]

-[screams]

-Whoa, whoa! Its okay. Hey. Hey.

-[wails]

-Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

Its okay. Its okay.

Im not gonna hurt you.

Im not gonna hurt you. Okay?

-Go on, get out of here. Go on.

-[panting]

Its not safe. Theres roaches here.

[panting]

Go on. Get.

[gun cocks]

[Raiman] Come on!

-Rai, what did you do?

-What the fuck are you doing?

-Youre killing them!

-Theyre roaches! [yells]

Youre fucking killing them, Rai!

Fuck you!

What the fucks wrong with you, man?

You got some blown shit.

-Pull it together!

-No.

[groans]

-[gunshot]

-[groans]

[panting]

[groans]

[panting] Are you all right?

You gotta get out of here. Come on.

Come on!

Fuck!

[breathes heavily]

You better run.

[wincing]

Shh. Shh.

[groans]

[wind blowing]

[both gasp]

[groans]

Here.

Im all right.

[panting]

You see me as I am.

Of course I see you.

You dont see roach?

You aint a roach.

Roaches is all...

Fucked up?

Roaches dont speak.

You just cant hear us.

-What the fuck are you talking about?

-Your implants. Your army implants.

The Mass system?

They put it in your head to help you fight, and when it works, you see us as something other.

One of us, Luka, was making a... a machine.

Light flashes.

Said it can interfere with the implant.

Youre roaches?

But Ive seen roaches.

Ive seen them, theyre fucking...

Theyre like, uh...

-Animals?

-No, theyre monsters. Ive seen them.

The implant made you see this.

[groans]

Fuck. The villagers... Huh?

The locals, they... they aint army.

They got no Mass in their heads.

Theyre scared of the roaches.

-They hate the fucking things.

-Everybody hates us.

Well, what the fuck do they see? Huh?

The fucking civs, when they look at a roach, what do they see?

What you see now.

They hate all the same because its what theyve been told.

[cocks gun]

[panting]

[birds squawking]

Ten years ago, it began.

Post-war.

First, the screening programme, the DNA checks, then the register, the emergency measures.

And soon everyone calls us creatures.

Filthy creatures.

Every voice. The TV. The computer.

Say we have... we have sickness in us.

We have weakness. Its in our blood.

They say that our blood cannot go on.

That we cannot go on.

My name was Catarina.

He was Alec.

Now were just roach.

But now...

Now you see me.

Now you see me.

Rai?

-Rai, no!

-[gunfire]

-[gasps]

-[gunfire]

[panting]

Tell me I shouldnt kill you.

-None of its true, Rai.

-What the fuck got you?

None of its true.

[spits]

-Fuck you.

-[thud]

Get up. Back against the wall.

Get up!

You want me to come in there?

[Arquette]

Its all right. I can just talk to him.

[door opens]

Thank you, Briley.

[door closes]

Stripe.

We owe you an apology.

We didnt spot the fault in your Mass.

I got you a coffee.

The device you found in the farmhouse, you mentioned it to the doctor.

Is this the thing?

We found it on an old block that you and Raiman were searching.

Looks like they reverse engineered it from some of our drone parts and so on.

The light here transmits a code.

Its like a virus.

It burrows into your Mass, trying to shut it down from within.

I tell you, those roaches are getting more ingenious than we give them credit for.

The whole thing is a lie.

I understand why youd say that, yeah.

Roaches.

They look just like us.

Of course they do.

Thats why theyre so dangerous.

Humans.

You know, we give ourselves a bad rap, but were genuinely empathetic as a species.

I mean, we dont actually really want to kill each other. [laughs]

Which is a good thing.

Until your future depends  on wiping out the enemy.

Come on, sit down.

[groans]

I dont know how much history you studied in school.

Many years ago,

Im talking early 20th century, most soldiers didnt even fire their weapons.

Or if they did, they would just aim over the heads of the enemies.

They did it on purpose.

British Army. World War I.

The brigadier, hed walk the line with a stick and hed whack his men in order to get them to shoot.

Even in World War II, in a firefight, only 15%, 20% of the men would pull the trigger.

The fate of the world at stake and only 15% of them fired.

Now what does that tell you?

It tells me that that war would have been over a whole lot quicker had the military got its shit together.

So we adapted.

Better training. Better conditioning.

Then comes the Vietnam War, and the shooting percentage goes up to 85.

Lot of bullets flying.

The kills were still low.

Plus the guys who did get a kill, well, most of them came back all messed up in the head.

And thats pretty much how things stayed until Mass came along.

You see, Mass... 

Well, thats the ultimate military weapon.

It helps you with your intel.

Your targeting. Your comms.

Your conditioning.

Its a lot easier to pull the trigger when youre aiming at the bogeyman, hmm?

Its not just your eyes, though.

Takes care of your other senses, too.

You dont hear the shrieks.

You dont smell the blood and the shit.

Theyre human beings.

Do you have any idea the amount of shit thats in their DNA?

Higher rates of cancer.

Muscular dystrophy.

MS. SLS. Substandard IQ.

Criminal tendencies. Sexual deviances.

Its all there.

The screening shows it.

Is that what you want for the next generation?

Dont feel bad about doing your job.

The villagers wont do it.

The folks back home wont do it.

They dont have Mass.

Mass lets you do it.

You.

Youre protecting the bloodline.

And that, my friend, is an honour.

Theres no honour here.

Its just killing.

-Lying and killing.

-No one lied to you.

You knew all of this. All along.

What are you talking about?

You agreed to have your Mass implant put in.

-[laughs]

-Set up. Every soldier does.

We cant just embed it and feed you a dream. Your mind would reject it.

You have to accept it. Willingly.

Its exactly what you did.

[man] So you see the terms and conditions there?

Yeah, thats like a whole essay, man.

What is that?

Thats your consent video.

From when you signed up six months ago.

[man] Basically, it says you agree to Mass implant activation.

-I didnt do this.

-Yes, you did.

-[man] Works kind of like hypnosis.

-Yeah, all right.

[man] Part of what youre agreeing to is not realising youve been put in this state.

If you follow me.

You wont recall this conversation.

Thats kind of funny, man.

Turn it off.

-[man] So for you to register consent...

-Turn it off, man.

Im gonna need your thumbprint there.

-Right here?

-[man] Yes, please.

Thats dope.

[faint beeping]

I didnt do that!

[faint beeping]

-I dont remember that!

-Just like the man said.

[beeping]

-I know youre upset.

-Fuck you!

-Whats happening?

-We control what you see, Stripe.

-I cant see nothing.

-Because we control it.

Give me my fucking eyes back.

-Let me lay out your options.

-Give me my fucking eyes back, man!

-[grunts]

-Let me lay out your options!

[breathes heavily]

Option one, you agree to have your Mass reset.

All the recollections of the past few days, including this conversation, erased.

No way.

Option twos incarceration.

-Id advise you to consider.

-Fuck you!

Mass is a friend.

Without it, you will remember everything that you did.

I aint having this Mass shit.

No more. No way.

Okay.

Well...

Maybe you should see what life would be like without it.

[beeps]

[Stripe] Whats happening?

Where am I?

Heidekkers ranch. Three days ago.

I have it all logged, Stripe.

We can feed you everything that you did.

Hey, no, no, no. No.

Please! Please dont shoot. Please!

Please! Please dont shoot.

-Please! Please!

-No! No!

No. Make it stop.

-No! Please.

-[whirring]

Make it stop!

-Please!

-[gunfire]

No! No!

[gasps]

-[screams]

-[gasps] No!

[whimpers]

-[stabbing sounds]

-[screams]

Fuck off! Stop it!

-[stabbing sound]

-[groans]

-[stabbing sound]

-No!

Youll see and smell and feel it all.

Is this what you want?

On a loop? In a cell all alone?

[whimpers]

[beeps]

[Stripe whimpering]

[Arquette] We can make that go away.

This conversation goes away too.

All of it.

But you gotta say the word.

Just say the word, Stripe.

And it all goes away.

Just say the word.



## 6. Hated in the Nation



[glass cracks]

[man] Theyre ready now.

[woman] Perhaps we could begin with your earliest recollections of the events of last May.

Well, I first got involved on the 15th.

[woman] Could you move the microphone a little closer?

[feedback whines]

Here?

I first got involved on the 15th.

[beeping]

[sighs]

[beeps]

[woman on TV]

Chancellor Tom Pickering has defended the governments stance on disability benefits as outrage over the death of so-called

"Wheelchair Martyr" Gwen Marbury grows.

More than 20,000 people have signed a petition demanding the sacking of newspaper columnist Jo Powers following her controversial article about Gwen Marbury.

Conservationists have announced another extinction.

The Siberian crane has died out following an unprecedented reduction in its wetland habitat.

And the honeybee-mimicking drone insects known as ADIs have been activated for their second summer.

[buzzing]

[man] Hope youre ashamed of yourself.

-Bitch.

-Pleasures all mine.

[phone beeps]

[keys jangle]

[van door opens]

Yo Powers?

Jo Powers.

Whatevers in there, will it detonate?

Thats from bakery. For you.

-Thank you.

-Thank you.

[door opens]

[man] Hello, darling!

[chuckles softly]

Creative, your well-wishers.

[man] Dont eat it.

Its a cake. Thats its job.

Im going to have a bath.

[woman on TV] Grammy-award-winning  rapper Tusk is still with us.

[cheering]

Now, Tusk, there are loads of online videos of people trying to emulate you, but this is our favourite.

Take a look at this.

[laughter and cheering]

Its a young chap called Aaron Sheen.

Hes nine years old.

[laughs] That is one goofy-looking kid.

-[laughter]

-Not a good dancer.

Hes nine years old!

Come on, hes a pretty good dancer.

That young motherfucker cant dance for shit.

He should probably just give up now, actually.

Dont hate on me for keeping it real.

Thats a goofy little motherfucker, and he cant dance for shit.

[woman] He is a big fan, Tusk.

-[Tusk] Dont hate on your boy.

-[phone beeps]

[woman]

Everybodys got to start somewhere.

[Tusk] Start somewhere?

I looked better than that--

-DCI Parke?

-No press.

No, Im not press. Um... TDC Blue Colson.

Im your shadow.

My shadow? They said--

Sorry. Call me Karin.

-Did you say your name was...?

-Blue.

-B-l-u-e, Blue?

-Yeah. Its not a nickname.

-My dad liked the sound of it.

-Uh-huh.

-Seen a body before?

-A couple.

-On video, I mean.

-[man] Boss?

-This is Blue. Shes my shadow.

-[helicopter whirrs]

-DS Nick Shelton.

-Whatve we got?

-Jo Powers.

-As in...

As in actual Jo Powers.

Saw something she wrote the other day about the wheelchair woman.

Clickbait piece. Pissed people off.

That article was fucking horrendous.

Even I signed the petition.

To get her sacked.

Come on.

Neighbours heard her screaming and called it in.

[Karin] Hell of a struggle.

Anyone else at home?

Husband. Found slashed across the stomach.

-By her?

-Dont know.

He was unconscious.

Theyve taken him to St. Columbus.

[Blue] Her mentions are still pouring in.

Restraining bolts in place.

-No other points of entry?

-No. But the outsides ringed with CCTV.

-We got the code for the cams?

-Uh-huh.

Okay, then. Check the recordings.

Bag that, send it to Toxicology.

Full autop for her, and we question the husband as soon as he wakes up.

Come on.

-You think its the husband?

-Im keeping options open.

Cutting the throat, thats unusual.

Thanks, chaps.

-But you do think he did it?

-Dont know anything yet.

These things are almost always either drink, drugs or domestic.

It is how it is.

-You driving home?

-No licence. Never passed.

Im sort of waiting for driverless to go mainstream.

-Get in.

-No, honestly, Ill get the Tube.

-Get in.

-Oh. Okay.

-So you were in Tech Crime?

-Digital Forensics. Computer murk.

[Karin] What happened, you get bored of it?

Not exactly. Youve seen what people tuck away on these.

Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.

Its not boring.

Im old enough to remember when they walked around with that stuff just tucked away in their heads.

[Blue] Right. But now they cant help but entrusting it to their little companions.

These things absorb who we are.

They know everything about us.

[Karin] If its interesting, why leave Forensics?

The Rannoch case.

-Ian Rannoch?

-The child killings, yeah.

I was the one who cracked his souvenir folder.

-So you saw those pictures?

-Mm-hmm.

And the videos too. Saw them all.

You see something like that, it changes you.

You either get defeated or you think--

You think, "Fuck me!

Ive got to help stop that shit."

Yeah.

-I mean, out here in the field--

-What fucking field?

You know what I mean.

Out here in the real world, you can genuinely prevent stuff, cant you?

You are young.

Maybe youre old?

-[Karin] Steady.

-[chuckles]

Thanks.

-See you tomorrow.

-Yes, boss.

[woman on TV] Jo Powers has been found dead at her home in West London.

The veteran columnist had been at the centre of controversy over an article shed written about disability rights activist Gwen Marbury.

The police have yet to confirm the cause--

[clicks]

[man] Its just the first floor, first door on the...

-Starting early?

-I asked Nick to show me the CCTV.

-Oh, yeah?

-Yeah.

No one came in or out.

Just Jo and her husband all evening.

-And that one there?

-Rear patio.

-Bust for months by the looks of it.

-Someone couldve come in through there.

Theyd have to climb the fence, make it in and out, knowing the camera wasnt working, but yeah, could have happened.

Technically.

Okay, sorry.

Youre keen to help.

-She just asked!

-Uh-huh.

[sighs]

[sighs]

[Karin clears throat]

Um... So...

Im collating every threat or insult levelled at Jo Powers over the previous 48 hours.

Say it is the husband.

Thats a coincidence, isnt it?

Not really.

Youve got everyone throwing a shit fit.

Stress levels in that household wouldve been through the roof.

That Internet stuff drifts off like weather.

Its half hate. They dont mean it.

The hate in a marriage, thats in 3D.

Thats had work put into it.

Thats sincere.

-Yeah. Im divorced.

-Um...

Husbands up and talking.

Youre gonna love his alibi.

[siren wailing]

[phone rings]

I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.

And when I ran in, she was walking round the room, stumbling.

She was clutching-- She was clutching her head as if she was in pain.

And then for a moment, she stopped.

And then it was like a seizure, she was... thrashing... clawing at her own skin.

And she turned...

[sobs]

She smashed her head... onto the desk, hard.

Then she-- she pushed me over.

That mustve been when the bottle smashed.

Then she picked it up, and she started cutting herself.

Here. She was gouging.

[sobs] I tried to stop her.

But she did this.

Then she cut her throat.

I tried to stop her.

She cut her own throat with the glass!

[man whimpers]

[cries]

[Karin] Mutilated and then killed herself for no apparent reason?

Id say the odds are against that.

He said it was like she was having a seizure.

Maybe there was something in the cake.

-The cake?

-It had "fucking bitch" iced on it.

-Couldve been something in it.

-Like a drug?

-I dont know.

-That makes people kill themselves?

He was sort of convincing.

-He just doesnt seem the--

-Dont say "the type."

Hes ordinary. That is the type.

What, so he bounced her head off the desk?

-Blue.

-Held her steady enough--

-Blue.

-What?

-Toxicology are looking at the cake.

-Okay.

Meantime, lets drop in on the person that sent it.

Got the name this morning.

-You dont need to patronize me.

-Were doing what you want.

-Following another lead.

-That you think is a waste of time.

Picking along dead ends just to prove theyre dead ends, thats most of the job.

Im not saying its a waste of time.

Just... you havent had a chance to get bored of reality yet.

Okay, that was patronizing.

-Is this who sent the cake?

-[Karin] Uh-huh.

-Have we checked her social feeds?

-I dont know.

"Death to Jo Powers."

She posted that on Monday morning.

The bakery said that theyre not meant to do obscenities, so I said it was for my sister, like just a joke thing, and they agreed, so...

Not cheap, their cakes.

With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?

Um... 

Well, I didnt pay for it all myself.

-We all put a pound in each.

-We?

Yeah. Im on a mums and carers message board.

I held a sort of whip-round.

-You crowd-sourced the money?

-Yeah, if you like.

From 80 other people?

Look, Im not... [laughs]

Im not being funny, okay?

I know she is dead.

But did you read what she had written?

How much do you think she got paid for spouting that horrible shit?

I dont know.

-I was just using my freedom of speech.

-To send a threatening message.

[scoffs] It was funny, okay?

And I can see if Id done it myself, then that would be a bit weird, but Im not mental.

You wished she was dead.

Well, uh...

[stammers] No, no, I didnt.

[phone beeps]

-"Death to Jo Powers."

-[laughs] Thats just...

Its a-- a hashtag game, you know, like "Death to..."

You insert the name of someone whos being an arsehole.

Its not... real. Its a joke thing.

And who started it? The hashtag?

I dont know. I dont know.

I saw it somewhere.

[phone beeps]

Excuse us a moment.

Toxicology say the cakes clean.

They also said:

"Thanks, it was delicious."

Well give her a caution.

Offensive Communications Act.

-Does that cover cakes?

-As far as shes concerned, it does.

What about the others who chipped in?

Are you going to tell them off, too?

-I didnt do anything.

-Start a thread about it.

Hospitals discharging the husband tomorrow.

Well bring him in for questioning.

Blue? Were arresting the husband.

Dont wallow in that.

The Internet will be pissed off with someone else today.

[Nick] Tusk.

Everyones pissed off with Tusk cause of that thing with the kid.

Hes catching a shit storm on social media.

-Liza will be organising the cake now.

-Yeah.

-See you tomorrow.

-See you.

-Whoo!

-♪ Turn a penny to a grand ♪

♪ When Im ready, rocking steady for my fans ♪

Where my ladies at?

-Yo! Good show.

-Yeah, thats a good show, brother.

-Im feeling my shit.

-You want some of that?

-What you smoking?

-Good shit, boy.

Aight.

Damn!

Eyes on, eyes on, eyes on.

Dont stress. Its legal here.

Pfft! Keep forgetting.

Welcome to Europe, I guess.

-Kinda takes the joy out of it.

-Tell me about it.

-[clatter]

-Careful! You break it, you pay for it.

-Always doing some bullshit.

-[Tusk yelling]

-[screams]

-Tusk? Tusk?

[screaming]

Yo, yo! We need some help over here!

[screams hysterically]

-I got you.

-Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!

Call an ambulance!

[screaming]

[monitor beeping]

[typing]

-[whirring]

-Commencing.

[rattling]

[beeping]

-Did he say what it is?

-Nope.

[buzzer]

-Good morning.

-Morning.

[man] Shes in here.

So I go in, and theres not just the wound from the glass.

Theres a hole. Dug in.

A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.

So I follow it, you know, how deep does it go?

It goes all the way from her ear canal to deep in her brain.

Where I find this.

Nestled right in there. Looks quite cosy.

-[Karin] Its one of those bee things.

-[Blue] An ADI.

An Autonomous Drone Insect from the Granular Project.

-How did it get in there?

-Id say it burrowed in.

-Fuck me.

-[man] Thats not the worst part.

It crawled right through her dorsal posterior insula, which is basically the brains pain centre.

Youre talking agony off the scale.

-Youd do anything to make it stop.

-Even cut your own throat.

-Good afternoon.

-DCI Parke.

-TDC Blue Colson.

-Okay. Thank you.

[Karin] Theyre so fucking fancy-looking, these companies.

-Billions on branding.

-Well, they can afford it.

The whole ADI projects pretty much bankrolled by the government.

Its why so many people are paranoid about it.

Let me guess, this is some people on the Internet?

They reckon the government uses the bees to spy on us.

Theres a schizophrenic world view.

[buzzing]

[buzzing]

Jesus, I didnt expect to find myself living in the future, but here I fucking well am.

-Karin Parke?

-Uh-huh.

Vanessa Dahl.

Please. Follow me.

Youre after information on our Project Swarm ADIs?

[Karin] Thats right.

[Vanessa] Any particular reason?

Yes.

[buzzing]

Rasmus.

Rasmus Sjoberg.

-He heads Swarm.

-Nice to meet you.

-Hi.

-Hi.

-Nice greenhouse.

-Yeah.

[buzzing]

[Karin] So, your bees, your ADIs, talk me through them.

Colony Collapse Disorder.

We still dont know whats behind it.

Bees themselves were virtually extinct so what our ADIs do is effectively stand in for them.

Theyre solar powered.

They dont need nectar, but they pollinate flowers the same way.

They crawl inside, pollen sticks to their legs and gets brushed off the next flower they visit.

-Can they make honey?

-Uh... No.

I was joking.

How do they know where the flowers even are? I mean...

Well, they have a sensor.

Like a... camera?

No. Just a basic visual sensor.

You see, they need rudimentary pattern recognition in order to locate compatible flora and navigate.

-They navigate?

-Yes.

You dont... I dont know... steer them?

Theyre autonomous.

Thats right, isnt it?

They make their own decisions.

They look after themselves.

Yes. You see, the ADIs cover the whole of the UK.

We couldnt command each one individually ourselves.

Its just not logistically possible.

No. [coughs] We simply set the behaviour and leave them to it.

They even construct these hives themselves.

They reproduce...

-They reproduce?

-Yes. Each hive is a replication point.

-[Blue] Its like a 3D printer, basically.

-[Rasmus] Exactly.

They create duplicates of themselves, create more hives and spread out exponentially.

-[Blue] Cover the country.

-Maybe you should work here.

Yeah, well, I read up on it.

Its impressive.

It is. Its just a shame its necessary.

The alternative would have been environmental catastrophe.

Bees were dying out.

So, what is it that brings you here?

We think one of your ADIs may be involved in an unexplained death.

Sorry? A death?

Uh-huh.

Thank you.

Yeah. Its one of ours.

But, look, these are not designed to...

Kill people? Id hope not.

Could it have malfunctioned somehow?

No. I mean, when they do malfunction...

It happens, but then they just break, they just hit the ground.

What if someone hacked one and then they found a way of controlling it?

Thats impossible.

You see, its got military-grade encryption, and you would need a diagnostic controller, which is also encrypted.

So I would say the likelihood is--

I dont know what hes saying, but its not the same as "impossible."

This is every hive we have online.

See...

These are the hives in the building here.

-How many bees per hive?

-Around 4,000.

-[Karin] Its like air traffic control.

-[Rasmus] Yeah.

Is that the search input?

-Yeah, but, uh... youd need...

-Sorry.

[tapping on keyboard]

-Jo Powers postcode.

-[beeping]

Is that who this is about?

-You said you get some malfunctions?

-A fair few, yes.

They smack into a car or something.

We even had people trap them.

You know, put them in the microwave for YouTube videos. [laughs]

And this logs any that drop off the system?

Logs everything, yes.

Did you lose any around here on Monday evening?

Well, I can check.

[beeping]

Just one. Went out at 1903 hours.

Here, I can replay.

[beeping]

There.

-Thats odd.

-[Blue] Whats odd?

When they pass between hives, they switch from one jurisdiction to another.

-Its, you know, like a...

-Its like a phone between cell masts?

Exactly. It tried to do that, but there was nothing to switch to.

Unless someone spoofed a hive and then theyve used that to commandeer your ADI.

No, you would need a diagnostic controller to do that.

[Blue] Whats the range on one of those?

[Rasmus] Ten, 20 metres, perhaps.

So whoever was controlling it would have to be no more than 20 metres away.

-Outside the house.

-Yeah. Sitting in a car, even.

-Can you trace back who did this?

-Yes. I-Im already trying to do that.

Uh...

You know what? Uh...

It would be easier without an audience.

Okay.

You two swap numbers, keep a line of communication.

Can you shut the whole thing down if need be... hypothetically speaking?

Even a short stoppage would damage the ecosystem, and wed need approval from the Department of the Environment.

Well need a list of any Granular staff that had access to that system, past or present.

[laughs] Some were government employees.

Use a different font for those if it helps.

Bye.

[buzzing]

[buzzing]

Nick, thats a set of Granular personnel records.

Root out anyone interesting.

Maybe not just one.

Could be a group involved.

Technically we should refer this up to the NCA, but theres no fucking way theyre taking this off me.

The NCA already knows about it.

What?

DCI Karin Parke?

-Yes.

-Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.

[Karin] How come youre here?

Theres been more than one.

This is Tusk, last night.

-Shit.

-They thought it was a fit.

Took him to the hospital.

He had to be anaesthetised to stop him mutilating himself.

X-ray seemed to indicate some kind of plaque or tumour in his brain

-so they popped him in the MRI.

-[groans]

Yeah. Basically one big magnet.

Tore it right out of his head, through the eye socket.

[groans]

Battered the ADI too.

Yours is more intact so Im gonna need it for analysis.

[Karin] Its evidence.

Twos a pattern. It knocks any malfunction theory in the head.

-And theyre similar victims.

-Similar?

Both in the middle of online shit storms.

Well, if you wanna kill someone, theres a million easier ways to do it.

Pull this off and youve done it from across the street.

No fingerprints, no DNA.

Its like wishing them dead.

Fuck.

Fuck.

Guys? Come here.

Okay, so, um... Jo Powers and Tusk, both were being kicked around the Internet for hours, but in both their cases, people were also tweeting their photos accompanied with this hashtag: #DeathTo.

-Like our friend the teacher.

-Right.

She didnt know where shed first heard of it, but trace it back, and it looks like the first real use of the hashtag was last weekend.

-By who?

-[Blue] Uh...

Looks like, um...

Looks like identical tweets from a set of duplicate bot accounts.

Um...

Automated. Its like spam.

This is someone trying to seed the tag, you know? Get it out there.

Its like bait. This is someone wanting people to pick up on it.

Check out the senders avatar photos.

[Karin] Bees. Shit.

Okay.

Theres more.

So each tweet had a sort of instruction video attached to it.

-[Karin] Uh-huh.

-There.

"Game of Consequences"?

Its like an unpopularity contest.

Pick someone you dont like and if enough other people choose the same name, then thats who gets targeted.

Here, watch.

[man] Game of Consequences.

-One: Pick a target.

-[Karin] Oh, my God.

Two: Post their name and photo with #DeathTo.

No.

Three: Most popular target will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.

Four: Game resets at midnight.

-[Nick] Oh, no.

-[Karin] Fuck.

Someones holding a public ballot, bumping off the top person.

-Jesus, its just mad.

-Yeah, and its growing.

Day one. 63 people used the hashtag on Jo Powers, okay?

On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.

-Whos using it now?

-Theres-- Theres loads more people.

Theres quite a few votes for the Chancellor.

-Yeah.

-Um...

But at number one... is 880 people using it on someone called Clara Meades.

-Whos she?

-Clara Meades.

Okay, um... it looks like she was at a demo, and she took a selfie in front of a war memorial.

-Pretending to piss on it.

-Nice work, Clara.

Yeah, its getting near the end of the vote, and her mentions are blowing up.

-Tusk isnt public knowledge yet?

-Um, no.

So people cant know the hashtag works.

Theyre using it to scare her.

-Yeah, but theyre gonna get her killed.

-We need to get to her before five.

Yeah. Pulling her citizens details.

Youre not supposed to have access to that.

Yeah, I know. Just getting her location.

There.

[breathes heavily]

[computer chirrups repeatedly]

[phone ringing]

[ringing stops, chirruping continues]

[sighs]

[phone rings]

[woman] Hello?

[whimpers]

[woman] Yeah, she is.

All right, all right, hold on.

Clara!

Police. For you.

How did they get my number?

-Hello?

-Clara Meades?

This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.

Sorry to track you down like this, but we think you may be in danger.

Sorry, is this a joke? Because all this stuff Im getting is not funny.

Im not joking.

Stay where you are until we get there.

And keep your windows closed.

Im setting up a perimeter.

Call Rasmus, we need him across this.

[sighs]

-Rasmus?

-Hi, Blue.

Im sending you a postcode and my GPS.

I need you to monitor the area.

Track my location and see if you get anything unusual, any rogue ADIs, yeah?

Yeah, great, good.

Look, if they come back,

I think I can catch them.

I have basically set a trap.

So if they-- if they try it again, weve got them.

-Are you Batman?

-They only just rolled them out.

Thisll turn every red light between here and there to green.

Fuck me. If this is the NCA life,

I should apply for a transfer.

Lets go.

We can take her here.

Its a safe house for terrorist informers usually.

[helicopter whirring]

[sirens wailing]

[man over radio] No target sighted.

[man over loudspeaker]

This is a police operation!

Everybody vacate their premises now.

Please leave...

[gasps]

[computer pings]

-[Vanessa] Whats that?

-[Rasmus] Someones trying to break in.

-Rasmus?

-I just picked up an attempted breach.

Granular, theyve got a breach.

-[Rasmus] One ADI just went offline.

-Where?

-800 metres from your location.

-Thats outside our cordon.

If someones trying to pilot it this way, theyre gonna turn round the moment they see all these uniforms.

Clara Meades? Im Karin Parke.

Did you pack a bag?

-Yeah, its by the door.

-Right, lets go.

-Rasmus got a track on them?

-Not yet.

[beeping]

Its just precautionary, and its only for one night.

Just gotta call in.

Hi.

No, not yet.

Hopefully never. Granular are onto it.

-Understood.

-[buzzing]

They housed a witness here for a while,

Shaun said.

-Mustve had kids.

-Have you got kids?

[both] No.

No plans.

[buzzing]

Up the stairs.

[phone rings]

-Rasmus.

-Still nothing. I cant trace it.

[sighs]

[sighs] At least theres an en-suite.

-Is there nothing?

-[Rasmus] No.

Whoever it is, theyve masked their path well.

[beeping]

But thats not--

-Fuck.

-[Blue] What?

-We just lost a whole hive.

-What does that mean?

Packed full of ADIs.

Lost them all too.

-No-- Rasmus?

-Theres thousands of them.

-Where?

-Its close to your location. [static]

Rasmus, say that again.

Blue? Blue. Its close...

Its very close to you.

Text it. Text it to me.

Rasmus. Text it to-- [static] Shit.

Do I get to redecorate?

[buzzing]

-[crackling on line]

-Hello. Hello.

[distorted voice]

[beeping]

[Rasmus] No...

Theyve got the whole thing.

Were not in control anymore.

-Theyve got the whole thing.

-[Vanessa] What are you doing?

-Fix it! Cant you fix it?

-Shut up!

[crackling on line]

[buzzing]

[buzzing continuing]

-[screams]

-[phone beeps]

[buzzing]

Shit.

[panting]

We need to go. Now. Now! Come on!

[buzzing]

Go. Go, go, go.

[Shaun screams]

[loud buzzing]

[gasps]

[Clara] Whats-- whats happening?

[buzzing]

-[rattling]

-[Blue] Karin...

-[rattling]

-[mutters]

[loud buzzing]

In there! Go!

[gasps]

-Help me block the gap!

-[Clara]Tell me whats going on!

Youre scaring the shit out of me!

[loud buzzing]

[door rattles]

[gasps]

[buzzing and rattling continue]

-[rattling]

-[screams]

Oh! Fuck!

[buzzing]

-[buzzing]

-[screams]

[buzzing]

The fan! The fan! [screams]

[screams]

[screams]

Get it away from me!

[screams]

[screams hysterically]

[gasps]

[buzzing]

[buzzing stops]

[panting]

[woman] Take your time.

Id seen so many bodies before.

At crime scenes, in autopsies.

But Id never seen anyone die.

And she was right there.

And can you describe the reaction of your colleague, Miss Colson?

Blue took it hard.

[Shaun] Uh-huh.

[man] Ill shut it down.

We thought this was one guy, some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity, hijacking one ADI and personally controlling it.

[Shaun] But there were thousands of them.

-So it cant be that, right?

-No.

-One person cant fly hundreds at once.

-No.

Whoever this is, theyre controlling the whole system.

-Do you know where from?

-Could be anywhere.

You need to fucking sort this out!

[kicks table]

How do the ADIs know who to target?

Couldve found Clara the same way you did, the identity database?

No. That just gives you the basic area.

We were in the room too, and they only went for her.

Facial recognition.

Its got to be facial recognition.

Which means the feed from their visual sensors, thats been accessed too.

-[Shaun] Thats not possible.

-[Blue] Its the only explanation.

Now look, the visual feed is secure between each ADI and the hive.

-There you go.

-Although... one of the governments conditions for backing the project...

Okay. Enough.

We had to consent to permitting government security services access to the visual feed at times of quote, "increased national security."

Which is, as I understand it, pretty much all the time.

-I wasnt happy about it.

-Your lot went along with it.

That implies a greater range of options than your lot presented.

-So they are spying on us.

-This is all classified.

So what did you do, did you put in a back door and route it through GCHQ?

I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.

So what dont you have your fucking noses in?

Look, millions of those things flying around, propping up the ecosystem?

Well, thats great, save the planet, hallelujah!

Governments not going to pump billions into it just cause some lab coat says so, and it grabs 200 green votes.

They saw an opportunity to get more, they took it.

Total nationwide surveillance.

We tracked suspects for weeks in ways they couldnt dream of.

-We prevented bombings, mass shootings.

-By spying on the public.

And keeping them safe, which is what they want.

Clara Meades isnt safe, though, is she, Shaun?

Knowing what you knew, that mightve helped us, but no,  you kept your little fucking secret.

Okay! The governments a cunt.

We knew that already.

Words going to get out about Clara.

The publics going to wake up and find this mental assassination game going on, and soon were going to have another body.

-So what do we do?

-I dont know.

Were totally locked out. Totally blind.

If I can work out how they got in,

I might be able to reverse engineer some means of getting control back.

Do the ADIs have a command log, on-board cache?

-Yeah, but thats encrypted.

-Ill need the key to that.

[phone rings]

[sighs]

Been through the employee files, found some POIs.

Bring them in.

Are you sitting in on these?

Granular interviews?

Ive got to be somewhere.

[radio beeping]

[woman on radio] Its 7:15.

Three deaths have now been linked to a hashtag circulating on social media.

Controversial journalist Jo Powers...

[man on radio] Good morning.

Have you posted the hashtag?

Is it real or an urban myth?

Well, thousands have been taking part, but how culpable are they?

People are dying, and we want to hear your thoughts.

Line seven, Liana...

This is real, this is happening...

I am happy to see her die.

[woman] Its not the hashtag killing them.

Thats just a game.

Like, if youre an arsehole, you deserve to be shamed.

[man on radio] Steve, line five.

[man] Yeah, but my point is, someones gotta be top of the list, yeah?

So why not make it someone, you know, who deserves it, like a racist.

[woman] With the hashtag, Ive seen celebrities, politicians, everyone.

This doesnt mean you have to sit there encouraging people to take part.

The point is this is already happening.

And people know that they can jump onboard because nobody will ever know if they did or didnt.

Well, lets just pause for a moment and go back to that top five.

As we have been saying, the Chancellor is at number one, and I want us to think about that.

What does that tell us about the choice of the nation?

[woman] Well, I cant say Im surprised that hes number one on the list.

Hes been pretty unpopular for quite a long time now.

[interviewer] But does that warrant his place on this list?

[woman] Im saying people dont have to think too hard about it.

Now thats hes number one, that should generate more discussions and probably more votes.

Thanks for your time.

-No good?

-No good.

-Well, thats all fascinating...

-Shaun.

-But when do we shut it down?

-Tom.

Forgive me for being sceptical about your agencys basic competence.

-Tom.

-Im on the fucking chopping block here.

Number one on the list.

The peoples fucking choice!

Farringtons number four, and hes a paedophile.

-Suspected paedophile.

-He did it. You know he did.

Lets just shut it down. All social media.

The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug.

Just for today, at least until Thumbelina here pulls his finger out and he actually catches someone.

I wouldnt advise shutting things down.

-But its possible? We can do that?

-The whole of social media?

-Yeah. Pull a North Korea on it.

-Well, yes, technically.

-Right, so push the off switch.

-[Shaun] Thats not a good idea.

-No?

-Not in my opinion.

Right, okay. Its just that speaking as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ.

If we shut it down, youll still be number one.

Guaranteed to be, in fact.

Hes right. If we let it run on, at least theres a few hours.

Anything could happen before five oclock.

The vote might change.

Yeah, and it might not.

What about that report? The archive job?

From 1985, that memo about Farrington?

-That was over an unrelated matter.

-[Tom] Leak it.

Tom, that would be a smear.

A head-to-toe shit smear,

I fucking hope so.

Hes in his 80s. Hes had his life.

Fuck him under the bus.

If I could suggest an alternative?

We move you to a safe location.

-Have you secured before five.

-Worked out well for you last night.

Ill show you.

This next ones Tess Wallender.

She was a junior.

So not much in the way of technical skills.

-Quit Granular for personal reasons.

-Nervous exhaustion, yeah.

Worked in Human Resources for Granular until she quit.

She took a photo of a guy on the Tube, said hed harassed her, lewd comments or something.

Turned out he had a learning disability so she caught a ton of shit on--

On social media.

-Hello. Im DCI Karin Parke.

-Hi.

It was like having a whole weather system turn against me.

Just hate message after hate message, around the clock, all piling on.

Its hard to describe what that does to your head.

Suddenly theres a million invisible people, all talking about how they despise you.

Its like a mental illness.

Fuck.

[Nick] What?

Shit.

I mean, hands up, I made a mistake, but the way people enjoyed kicking me, thats what got to me.

The casual fun they had and, um...

I just felt I couldnt go on.

Who found you?

Um... Garrett, my flatmate.

He found me in the bath five minutes after Id slashed them.

I mean, its crazy.

Im half-conscious.

Hes dragging me out of the bath, and Im telling him to get out, saying, "Im naked."

He tied towels round my wrists, kept me conscious, kept stroking my hair till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.

Sort of weird.

I think he always had a thing for me.

And we worked at the same place so, you know... awkward.

-He worked at Granular?

-Yeah. On the ADI thing.

-He was a real wunderkind. Ultra-smart.

-What did you say his name was?

Garrett. Garrett Scholes.

Garrett Scholes.

We need the whereabouts of a Garrett--

Scholes. We were about to tell you.

It was buried in the on-board memory of the Jo Powers ADI.

-What was?

-A manifesto. A 98-page manifesto.

And check this out.

Theres fucking selfies in it.

[buzzing]

[man] So were good to go?

[buzzing]

Okay, thats the charge in place.

Okay. Pull back.

Were all set here.

Detonate.

[explosion]

So, the plan is, we move you to an underground bunker, knock out every hive within a ten-mile radius.

And, what, just leave me there?

How long for?

Its a temporary measure.

How long till you take out all the hives?

Theres 20,000, 30,000 of them.

That would take two years.

Two years, a victim a day.

More to the point, the environmental impact would--

Fuck that.

[man] Shit!

-What?

-Fuck!

Stay back, stay back!

Get back!

[buzzing]

[men screaming]

Go, go, go! Get away!

[men screaming]

For fucks sake, move!

[static, buzzing]

Whats your Plan B?

[buzzing]

He was on the original employee roster, but we discounted him.

He left the country six months ago.

We thought we were looking for someone nearby.

Run a full trace on him.

Everything we can find.

Lunatic with production values, thats the worst kind.

"Thanks to the technological revolution, we have the power to rage and accuse, spout bile without consequence.

Only by being forced to recognize the power technology grants us, to acknowledge individual responsibility..."

Is it all like this?

He likens the population to insects, says we revel in cruelty, that its a weakness that should be bred out of us.

Recurrent theme is he wants people to face the consequences of what they say and do.

-Wants to force that on them.

-The whole things a moral lesson?

He wanted us to find this and spread it about.

Well, fuck him.

Fuck.

Shit.

Karin. Karin. Hes messed up.

Hes put this document together himself, right?

His author names in the metadata.

But he stripped out everything else, so we dont know when hes written it, for example.

Mm-hmm.

Most of the photos are clipart off the Internet, except this one.

-The selfie.

-Thats where hes screwed up.

Hes taken it with his phone, and the phone left a geotag on the image.

-So you know where he took this?

-I know precisely where.

Hes here and Granular HQ is there.

[phone pings]

[crash]

-Armed police! Stay down!

-Armed police!

Armed police! Stay where you are!

Armed police! Show yourselves!

Move!

[Karin] Lifestyles of the rich and famous.

There. The forge.

[gasps]

[Karin] Nice one.

Half the drives I sifted in forensics had scorch marks on em.

-[Blue] What do you think?

-Yeah. Looks like his toolkit.

-You can use it?

-Pretty much the key to the door.

So you can get control back?

Send the deactivation?

[Rasmus] Well, Ive got his source code.

-I should be able to bounce him out.

-Be quick.

[Karin] Key to the door?

Our guy doesnt seem the type to leave keys lying around.

Well, Im in.

Okay. Deactivate her.

-Yeah, I need to repair permissions.

-Fucking hell.

Thats weird.

Whats weird?

-[Shaun] Times ticking.

-That file. Wasnt there before.

-This file?

-Yeah.

[computer beeps]

What is it?

-Blue?

-I think theyre IMEI numbers.

What does that mean?

Every phone, every device has a unique number, an IMEI number.

It tethers it to a unique user.

-Yeah.

-But I can check, just... reverse lookup.

[Rasmus] Take it easy.

[Karin] Who are these people?

[Blue] I dont know.

Theres 387,000 of them.

Are these IDs your spooks have been collecting?

-No! Are you ready yet?

-Yeah, almost there.

Wait. Wait.

What was the name of that teacher?

Hate cake.

-Liza. Liza Bahar.

-Liza Bahar.

[Shaun] Fucks sake.

This is a list of everyone whos used the hashtag.

What?

Everyone who took part in the Game of Consequences.

Theyve hoovered up their ID from GCHQ by the looks of it.

That backdoor worked both ways, it seems.

-See if Im on there.

-What?

I posted the tag earlier with Scholes face.

-Just trying to get a reaction from him.

-Yeah, yeah, almost there.

[Blue] Youre there.

[Rasmus] Almost there.

Why has he collected everyone who took part? I mean...

[Rasmus] Okay. Im ready.

-Shit.

-Run it now.

No. Think. He left us a trail.

-Oh, come on.

-That photo with the whereabouts, its too big a mistake for him.

He knew wed do this.

-Now were shutting it down, all right?

-And maybe thatll trigger some endgame, something to do with that list.

What if those are his real targets?

The people on the list.

Everyone who took part.

Consequences.

The hate figures were the bait.

The players are the target.

-Run the deact command.

-[Rasmus] Now just wait a minute, okay?

-Run it.

-[Karin] No!

[beeping]

[gasps]

[beeping]

[Rasmus] Yeah. [laughs]

Yeah, it worked.

[Shaun sighs]

Sorry, but that needed doing. [laughs]

[beeping]

-No, no, no, no, no.

-[Karin] What?

No. No.

-[Rasmus] Fuck!

-[Karin] No.

[Karin] Shit.

Oh, no.

[woman] Were all tragically familiar with the rest of the events of that week.

And we need no reminding of the sheer scale of the loss of life that followed.

No. No, we dont.

[woman] And what became of Ms. Colson?

I think she blamed herself.

No. I know she did.

She felt shed followed his breadcrumb trail and sprung the whole thing.

She left the force.

I didnt hear from her.

Rang her, tried emailing, but no response.

Then, um...

About four months later, they found her things.

On a beach.

With a note.

[breathes deeply]

She killed herself?

Thats the base theory, yes.

# Season 4



## 1. USS Callister



-[man] Captain Daly.

-Report.

A non-federation vessel jumped straight out of white space right in front of us.

-Valdack.

-That cant be.

My data scan indicates a heavily armored Gorgan Dreadnought, vessel ID number 9864321.

Thank you, Dudani. Valdack must have hijacked it from the Fermi hub and tracked our position.

-Tulaska, shield status?

-Shields 100%.

-Helmsman Packer?

-Captain.

-Prime rear thrusters.

-Rear thrusters primed.

[Walton]

If thats Valdack, hell rip us to shreds.

Captain, we have to surrender.

Theres no other way.

Lets not lose our heads,

Lieutenant Walton.

[zapping]

-Shields at 68%.

-[alarm wailing]

Heavy damage reported, decks six through ten.

Fires in med center and major rupture to cargo bay Alpha.

Weve got no choice!

Do you want me to open comms with Valdacks craft, Captain?

-Negative.

-[zapping]

[all groan]

-Shields at 54%.

-Theres no way out.

-Captain, please.

-[Daly] Not now, Walton.

Helmsman Packer, take us into that asteroid gas cluster.

-Into the cluster?

-Thats suicide, sir.

It is our only chance.

[Daly] That gas cluster is charged with ionized pyron particles.

If our shields hold, we can use them to increase our photon intensity.

Packer, increase thrusters.

[engine thrusts]

[Tulaska] Shields at 43%.

Itll tear the ship apart, Captain!

Walton, you are a Space Fleet officer.

Act accordingly.

-Shields at 32%.

-Valdacks not following.

Packer, turn us around.

[engine rumbles]

-[Daly] Tulaska, charge photon bolts.

-Bolts charged, Captain.

-Fire!

-[zapping]

His hulls breached, shields gone.

Hes defenseless.

-Lieutenant Lowry, open comms.

-Hes already hailing us, Captain.

-[Daly] On screen.

-[bleeps]

Captain Daly, may you drown in the venom of 900 Tragorian snakes!

[Daly] You are defeated, Valdack.

Return the plasmorthian crystal and well cause you no more damage.

You must think me a fool, Captain!

I know the crystals capabilities, and I will die before I give it up!

I gave you a chance, Valdack, showed you mercy.

-Reflect on that while you can.

-[yells]

-Close comms.

-[bleeps]

-Tulaska, destroy his ship.

-Yes, Captain.

[bleeping]

[zaps]

-That was incredible, Captain.

-You saved our lives.

[Walton] Im so sorry

I lost it back there, Captain.

Not for the first time, Walton.

And I should know by now never to doubt you.

-[alarm beeps]

-[Walton] Please forgive me.

At ease, Walton.

Captain, sensors indicate an escape pod ejected from Valdacks ship before detonation.

Hes escaping with the crystal.

You want me to plot a pursuit course, Captain?

No.

Well let him go... for now.

-Great decision-making, Captain.

-Three cheers for Captain Daly.

-Hip hip.

-[all] Hooray!

-Hip hip.

-[all] Hooray!

-Hip hip.

-[all] Hooray!

♪  For hes a jolly good fellow

For hes a jolly good fellow ♪

♪ For hes a jolly good fellow ♪

♪ And so say all of us ♪

God bless you, Captain. God bless you.

[elevator beeps]

[automated voice]  Thirteenth floor.

-Welcome to Callister.

-Oh.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Hey.

[negative beep]

[negative beep]

Uh... Elena, my pass doesnt work.

You must renew on first of each month.

Yeah, I know that, but the first was on the weekend, so...

OK.

-[beeps]

-[doors open]

Thank you.

Youre welcome.

[automated voice]  Prepare to enter the most immersive gaming experience in years,

Infinity,  from Callister Inc.

-Morning, Mr. Daly.

-Helmsman Packer.

Huh?

Uh, I mean, Mr. Packer. Nate.

[laughs]

OK.

[Daly] Are you making coffees?

Yeah.

Do you think maybe you could make me one too?

[laughs] Sure, sure. Uh, what do you want?

Just vanilla latte. Skim milk.

Yeah, good call. Cause...

[Packer clears throat]

[chattering]

[woman]

...those are very, very big numbers.

We might just have to hold you to that.

Well, no, yes, of course. [laughs]

Sure. Yes.

[crashing]

Oh, are you OK, man?

[sighs]

I guess you didnt see my gym bag.

Here. Come on. [strains]

-Im sorry, bud. [pats]

-OK.

You left it... [groans]

[man] Youre gonna do it for me and make it good.

You know you are a god to me at least.

[laughing]

[knock on door]

Oh. The ladies bathroom is that way.

The signs kind of confusing.

Youre Robert Daly, right?

-Right.

-Yeah, hi.

Im Nanette, Nanette Cole.

Um...

I started here today, coding on the update, and I just wanted to, uh, pass on my admiration to the person who actually designed  Infinity.

The procedural algorithm is amazing.

Its just some beautiful code.

Thank you.

Thats actually the reason that I wanted to work here.

-You must be busy. Im so sorry.

-No, no, its fine.

-Sorry. [laughs]

-No.

-Well, just fangirling. Sorry. Um...

-[both laugh]

[Nanette gasps]

Ooh... vintage.

-Yeah, its  Space Fleet.

-Wow.

[Daly] Its a TV show. Before your time.

Before my time, actually.

But it was... visionary.

Is this on, like, tape?

Yeah, Ive got the VHS, the DVD, Blu-ray.

The whole thing. Seasons one to six.

Netflix has it these days, but...

Aboard the spaceship  USS Callister.

-OK, yeah.

-Mm-hmm.

So-- OK, so Callister is like the, uh--

Yeah, when we set up the company, um...

I suggested we call it Callister as kind of a little tribute.

Walton didnt really get the reference, but he let me have that one.

Mini-skirted damsels.

[laughs]

A little cold for that in space.

That is just what a Bargradian sand warrior would say.

[Nanette chuckles]

[Walton] Bob, Christmas is closing in like a goddamn meteor.

Weve got customers all over our balls waiting for the  Infinity  update.

Tell me its gonna be up and running before the weekend.

-Oh, Ill ask Kabir--

-Youre CTO. Dont ask anybody anything.

You should be telling people things like Im telling you right now.

-Ill talk to him.

-Good.

-Im sorry.

-OK.

-Hello.

-[Nanette] Hello.

Sorry, I couldnt find a good moment to...

Oh, you must be new.

Uh... Im James Walton. I run the company.

-[Nanette] I--

-Well, we run the company, kind of.

Bob here is the hardware, and I am the shiny front end.

-Im Nanette Cole.

-[Walton] Which department?

-Engine architecture.

-And its your first day?

Uh...

-[stutters] Yeah.

-Have you had the tour?

-[keyboard clicking]

-No, I...

Please, allow me.

[Nanette] OK.

It was so nice to meet you. [laughs]

[Walton] Just a little bit.

Its a different environment

I set up here.

People call it a carefree environment.

I call it "care-full."

-[Nanette] Interesting.

-Not scary.

[chattering continuing]

Dudani?

Kabir?

Mm. Mr. Daly.

Do you have the latest ETA on the update patch?

Its just theres still some runtime errors.

Well, the thing is, we could have it ready by end of play today, but if we had time, we could alter the trading mechanics, tweak the critical hit system, but of course, thatd add another week, maybe ten days or so.

Mr. Daly?

-Yeah. Yeah, do all of that, thank you.

-Ill... OK, were on it.

[chattering, laughing]

[number pad bleeps]

[door whirs]

-[device bleeps]

-[whirring]

[device boots up]

[Walton] Welcome back, Captain.

Have you located Valdacks position?

Not yet, but our sensors are scanning every star system between here and Valatros.

So your answer is no?

Uh...

Im afraid so, sir.

[Walton gasps, groans]

[grunting]

You... are pathetic, Walton. What are you?

-[Walton gasping]

-Whats that?

[inhales] Pathetic.

[gasps]

[groans, panting]

[Daly] So Valdacks out there somewhere and you village idiots are asleep at the wheel.

Youre not just disgraceful, youre disgusting, all of you.

So can you do one thing?

Can you find Valdack?

Im not asking. Im telling you!

Understand?

-Hmm?

-Yes.

-[Daly] Yes?

-Yes, Captain. Yeah.

-[Daly] Yes.

-Aye, Captain.

[Daly] Huh?

Well, all right.

Tulaska, check security protocols.

If theyve expired, youre in trouble.

-Yes, Captain.

-[bleeping]

Dudani, recheck those probe results.

-No room for errors.

-Of course, Captain.

-Helmsman Packer?

-Captain.

Vanilla latte.

-Skim milk.

-At once.

[Daly] Walton.

Exit game.

[device whirs]

[device bleeps]

[keyboard clicking]

Hi, Nanette. You feel like you have everything you need here?

Mm-hmm.

-All right. Thats a nice sweater.

-Oh. Thank you.

-[Walton] Cashmere?

-[chattering]

[knock on door]

Mr. Daly, got that new ETA on the update patch.

-New ETA?

-Yeah, its all good.

But now were looking at December 24th for rollout.

We dont patch until Christmas Eve?

Well, yeah, I mean, with the alterations you approved.

OK, OK. Thank you.

[Dudani] OK.

[door closes]

[knock on door]

-Hi, Robert.

-Hi.

Um, I was just gonna fix a coffee.

Do you want one?

-Sure.

-OK.

Um... vanilla latte with skim milk.

-[Nanette] Okey-dokes.

-OK.

Absolutely.

[laughs]

Mm-hmm.

-Well, yes, they are great numbers.

-[machine whirs]

[laughs] OK. Mm-hmm.

-Ta-ta.

-[device beeps]

Total fucking shitwit.

-Do you want coffee?

-Um, Brushed Suede. Thank you.

So how are you settling in?

Are you settling in?

Uh, yeah, yeah.

Everyone here is really friendly.

And um... it is not like my last job, thank God.

-Yeah?

-It was a toxic workplace, you know.

-My boss was a major-league bully and...

-[machine beeps]

-Its not like here, like with Mr...

-Walton.

-Yeah.

-Oh, yeah. Hes a really good guy.

Hes a bit of a player.

Chuck a sandwich across the room, hell fuck it before it hits the ground,

-but hes basically an all right bloke.

-[chuckles]

OK. [laughs] Well, theres uh... two bosses here anyway, so I guess--

-Two how?

-Robert Daly.

Oh!

I mean, well, yeah, technically. [scoffs]

Mr. Daly is actually the whole reason that Im here.

-Really? Interesting.

-[Nanette] I mean...

Who wouldnt wanna work under an incredible mind like that, you know?

His coding is... [laughs] Its sublime.

Do you have a thing for him?

Daly? No, no. No. Its not like that.

[stammers] Its purely...

Its professional.

I like his code.

Ah. Fucking hell,

I was gonna say, you know, dont be too nice to him cause he gets a bit starey.

Mm.

Wide berth, thats my advice. Wide berth.

-OK.

-Yeah.

Thank you.

-There you go.

-Thank you.

[exhales]

-[Lowry] Bye.

-No bye. Im coming.

[Lowry] No. Suck a dick, Karl.

[woman] Later, guys.

[machine beeps]

[whirring]

[beeping]

[automated voice]  Welcome to Callister.

[card beeps]

[Daly] Thank you.

Youre welcome.

[chattering]

[Walton] Goddamn it, Robert!

-Christmas Eve. Really?

-Uh...

Not OK.

[door slams]

[electronic whirring]

[whirring]

[gasps]

Oh.

[breathing heavily]

Hello? [echoes]

[gasps]

-[distant chatter]

-[gasps]

[gasping]

Oh, boy. It looks like theres a new girl in the office.

Whats your name, hon?

[Walton] Come in. Let me fix you a drink.

We have everything from Bengarian phlegm shots to uh... ooh, distilled root blood from the Cangor quadrant.

Whats your poison? Some of this actually is poison, so dont be shy.

Am I dreaming?

Yeah, no, no, fraid not.

-I remember dreaming.

-[Packer] Me too.

[Nanette] But where am I?

This is the  USS Callister,

Space Fleets finest, exploring the furthest reaches of the known universe and beyond.

We are its loyal space crew and now, apparently, so are you. Cheers.

[slurps]

Your name? Babe, whats your name?

Nanette. Weve met.

Maybe, in the real world.

I wouldnt have no way of knowing.

-What do you mean?

-Youd better sit down.

No, I dont... I dont wanna sit down.

I wanna know whats going on.

Youre on board Robert Dalys ship.

Robert Daly, the CTO?

Here hes Captain Daly, our fearless leader.

[Lowry] Yeah, youre seriously gonna need to sit the fuck down.

-Uh...

-Welcome. [chuckles]

You are um... Hey, hey.

Youre the intern from work, right? Nate?

Packer. Nate Packer.

Wait. So Im still just the intern out there?

Jesus.

Youre um... Youre... Youre...

Dudani. Diagnostics.

-Welcome.

-Right.

-Youre the receptionist, right?

-Elena.

-Your skin is blue.

-[Tulaska] Weird blue alien skin, I know.

Its fucked up.

Almost sort of racist.

[groans]

[strains] OK. Walt, fix her something, something shell recognize. Vodka.

-Hey. So whats it like out there now?

-What?

-What year is it?

-[Lowry] Dont do her head in.

-[Packer] What?

-What year? I... [stutters] saw you today.

Ooh. Did you see me? Did I look thin? Hmm?

Like, wheatgrass yogurt thin?

Can we not pop her fucking mind?

Someone needs to be straight with me right now.

OK. OK, listen.

This is  Infinity.

Thats what were all inside.

Thats where all of this exists.

Infinity , the game?

Dalys got his own modded version of  Infinity, reskinned to look like his favorite TV show.

-Space Thing? Space Thing?

-Space Fleet.

-Hence the groovy decor.

-And this tasteful get-up.

Infinity.

Thats an online game, like a multiplayer deal. This... [inhales]

This is his development build, sealed off so he can control it.

He keeps it offline so the custom code hes written cant be detected and deleted.

Mm. Yes, its a bubble universe, ruled by an asshole god.

He... put us in... in here?

Mm-hmm.

Drink your vodka.

-How do we get out?

-No, really, drink it.

Drink it.

-You cant leave.

-[chokes] What?

None of us can.

-Because youre not actually you.

-[Nanette] What?

I know its mental, but youre a copy of you.

-A digital clone.

-No.

No, I am... Im me. I am me.

-Im me.

-[Walton] No, not the real you.

Dalys created an identical digital version of you, of all of us.

From your DNA.

Hell have harvested it somehow.

He told me he got mine from the rim of a smoothie cup.

He retrieved Packers juices from the bathroom.

Man, you have got to let that go.

She does not need details.

Basically hes got a gizmo--

I theorize an advanced biometric DNA virtual clone.

Hes got a fucking gizmo.

Thats what I said.

He fed your DNA in, he put you inside his computer and, bam, you pop up here like a Pop-Tart.

Yeah, weve all been through it.

He brings us in for different reasons, shit we did in the office.

I called him out for staring.

I reset admin permissions on a test build for 14 minutes.

Insufficient smiling.

-I brought him the wrong sandwich.

-OK, never mind the reasons.

The point is that were stuck in Dalys playground, and thats all you need to know.

This is a dream. Yeah, it has to be.

Its more like an eternal waking nightmare from which there is no escape.

-No, no. No, no, no. No, no, no.

-[Lowry] Oh, for fucks sake,

Im trying to break her in gently.

The quicker she gets it, the easier itll be.

[whirring]

[Tulaska] Daddys home.

[Packer] Hell be here any moment.

[Nanette] No. Im gonna get out of here.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

You gotta stay on the bridge.

He controls everything.

-He does shit to make us cooperate.

-Get off.

-You have no idea. Im trying to help.

-[Lowry] Just leave it.

Hes gonna fuck us up if she doesnt play ball.

Yes, well, shes gonna have to work it out for herself, like we all did.

[panting]

[spaceship whirring]

[groans]

-Theres gotta be a way out. Come on.

-[beeps]

[whimpers]

[screaming]

[whimpers]

Lieutenant Cole, welcome aboard.

Crew, we have a new member of the team,

Science Officer Nanette Cole.

Please, take your post.

I believe weve finally managed to track Valdack to an uncharted planet.

-No.

-Take your post. That is an order.

Im not doing this.

The whole things much better if you let yourself get into it.

If you think that Im playing along with your  Space Force  bullshit...

-Space Fleet.

-[Nanette] Whatever.

-You can think again.

-This is my ship.

-I am your captain. An order is an order.

-Then go fuck yourself.

Sir.

OK. So were doing it this way.

[scoffs]

[mocking] Are you gonna throw a fireball?

[snaps fingers]

[muffled gasps]

[thuds]

[muffled sounds]

Oh, dear. You cant see.

You cant breathe.

Unpleasant, isnt it?

[muffled groaning]

Do you submit?

You wont die, you know.

No one dies in here unless I want them to.

I can keep you like this forever if I feel like it.

Forever gasping for breath with a mouth that isnt there.

Do you submit?

[muffled agreement]

Good girl.

[gasps, coughing]

[breathes heavily]

Lieutenant Cole, Valdacks hideout.

Triangulate the signal, please.

[Nanette pants]

[sobs]

[whispers]

Its any button. Theyre all the same.

[beeps]

[beeps]

Well?

[gasping] Im getting a signal from a class five planet.

-Rannotch.

-[Lowry] Rannoch.

[stutters, whispers] Rannoch B.

Excellent. Dudani, prepare the transmat system.

-Of course, Captain.

-Walton, Packer, Lowry, with me.

Well transport down to the planet, reclaim the crystal and bring Valdack to justice.

Actually, Cole, you come too.

Perfect opportunity for you to prove youre more than a recommendation from Space Fleet. What do you say?

-Mr. Dudani, transport.

-Aye aye, Captain.

[all exhale]

[Nanette gasps, groans]

[Daly] Breathable atmosphere.

[device whirs]

Scanning for plasmorthian traces.

Crystals this way. Lets go.

-Nate. Hey, Nate.

-Helmsman Packer, OK?

Call me Helmsman Packer. He hates it when we dont use our proper titles.

OK. You got a gun, so lets take him out.

-Then give it to me.

-OK, one, our guns dont even work.

Only his does. And two, the motherfucker is invincible, OK? Come on, lets go.

At least youve got a gun.

[device whirring]

-Captain.

-[Daly] Shh.

We meet again, Captain Daly!

[cackles]

-Were trapped.

-[gun whirs]

Not advisable.

My plasma grenade will turn you into screaming soup.

Hes not going to kill us, Captain.

He had the element of surprise.

Hed have done it when he had the chance.

Havent worked out how to use the crystal, have you, Valdack?

Its true, I require your Space Fleet knowledge.

But its also true that youre gonna give it to me!

Dont be so sure.

[laughs]

-Jesus. I...

-Shh.

Lets see how your resolve holds up once youre devoured one by one by my Arachnajax!

[roars]

-Holy shit. Oh, my God.

-[Walton] Were all gonna die.

[Arachnajax snarls, snorts]

[roars]

Killing us wont make us tell you how the crystal works, Valdack.

-We will never...

-[device rings]

Hold on. I think my pizzas here.

-[sighs]

-[device rings]

Pause game.

[powering down]

[Nanette] Whats happening?

[Walton] You heard him.

He paused the game.

Cause hes got a pizza delivery... out there.

[Arachnajax pants]

[doorbell ringing]

Hold on.

[doorbell continues]

[Arachnajax exhales]

[Packer] Watch out. Hell be back soon.

Ah. Thats good.

This launchers heavy as shit.

[Valdack] How you holding up?

You know, were existing.

How you doing, Gillian?

[Arachnajax grunts]

Well, yeah.

-[Walton] Well, you look great.

-Her names Gillian.

-[Walton] Did you lose weight?

-She was in marketing.

Yeah, Daly turned her into... that because she wouldnt play along when he cloned her into here.

[Lowry] This universe is littered with things like her, poor fuckers who stepped out of line.

-Thank you.

-[man] Thanks.

[device whirs]

-[Walton] Here comes Captain Dick.

-Hey.

-[Packer] Hey. Hey.

-[Arachnajax growls]

[reciting] Im gonna get you.

Im gonna get you.

Hey. Hey.

[Walton exhales]

If we die, the secret of the crystal dies with us, Valdack.

Oh, my God. We   are all gonna die!

-[fake sobbing]

-[Valdack laughs]

-[Daly] Valdack?

-What is it, Captain? Final words?

Over there. A naked lady.

Really?

-[gun blasts]

-[Valdack groans]

[screams, grunts]

[Arachnajax whimpers]

Great plan, Captain.

[all laugh]

[Walton] Unparalleled tactics, Captain.

[panting]

Weve fought many battles, havent we, Captain?

We have.

And Ive been a good adversary for you, have I not?

[sighs]

Then please...

[coughs]

...end it.

-Please.

-[gun whirs]

Killing in cold blood is against Space Fleet code.

-[groans]

-I wish I could help.

[mutters]

Sorry, bud.

[whimpers]

-[Daly] Take him to the brig.

-[Valdack groans]

-[Daly] Dudani.

-Captain.

-Transport us aboard.

-Yes, Captain.

[Valdack] No more.

-[Lowry] Its OK.

-[Valdack wails, echoing]

-[Walton] Hip hip.

-[all] Hooray!

-Hip hip.

-[all] Hooray!

Tomorrow you should reconsider your... amenability.

I may not be feeling so benevolent.

Exit game.

-Oh. Fucking hell.

-This was tense.

I dont like tense.

-Drink?

-Mm-hmm.

[Dudani] So how was the mission?

Wasnt too bad. Usual standoff storyline.

-Ooh. Saw Gillian from marketing. Yeah.

-Oh.

There is no way that I am kissing that asshole.

Then hes just gonna get more and more pissed.

-How about you kiss him, then?

-[Lowry] You get used to it.

Its-- Theres no tongues.

If thats any consolation, theres never any tongues.

-Doing tongues is not Space Fleet way.

-Mm.

Its not like it can go beyond kissing anyway.

What do you mean?

Oh. You havent noticed?

[Walton clears throat]

[Nanette] What are you doing?

[stammers]

Please. Please, dont do that. Dont...

Oh, my God.

-Oh. Oh. Oh.

-[Walton] Yes.

Theres no genitals in Space Fleet.

This is a wholesome universe.

[Dudani] He must have modified our code that way.

Mm. Were all the same. If you dont believe me, take a look down there.

We have tried grinding our mounds together out of sheer boredom.

-No sensation at all.

-Cant even shit.

Cant even have the basic fucking pleasure of pushing out a shit.

[sighs] I miss taking shit.

OK.

Stealing my pussy is a red fucking line.

-We are gonna get this bastard!

-[Walton] No.

-[Nanette] Yeah.

-Weve tried a million times.

No way out.

Walton. Come on, Walton.

[Walton] Like I said, hes an asshole god.

Mnh-mnh.

Dalys smart, but hes not a god.

Hes a coder.

He is fallible.

Kabir, what was that thing he was holding in his hand, that scanner thing?

His omnicorder, primary communications device.

You said he kept his version of the game offline.

But the omnicorder made contact with the outside world when the pizza came, so its gotta be connected to his home system at least.

The omnicorders gone.

It loads when he loads, and it goes when he goes, and thats the only one.

No.

There has got to be a way to connect.

[beeping]

You wont hack it. Ive tried.

I havent.

[beeping continues]

[Nanette gasps] Bingo.

-[Dudani] Oh, thats good.

-Yeah.

-This is part of  Infinitys  front end.

-Yeah.

You can invite a friend with a custom message.

-[Lowry] A message to outside?

-Just one. 140 characters maximum.

So who are you gonna contact?

-[exhales]

-[elevator dings]

Thirteenth floor. Welcome to Callister.

-Hey, Elena.

-[sighs] Hi.

[phone vibrates]

-You need me buzz you in?

-What? Uh, no, no, I--

-I got that for you.

-Oh. Thank you.

After you.

[card beeps]

Um...

Mr. Daly, hi.

Hi.

Can I talk to you for a second?

Did you just send me an  Infinity  invite?

Wha... No.

It was really weird.

It had a message attached.

Something about people trapped in a game.

Probably just a spambot.

Firewall doesnt always get them all.

-Yeah.

-I wouldnt-- I wouldnt worry about it.

You didnt open the link, did you?

Oh, God, no.

-Maybe upgrade your security software.

-All right.

Have a good one.

[chattering]

[guitar strumming]

Thats the thing there.

[Walton sighs] Oh, yeah.

Could you please, please cut that shit out?

Im trying to make it like a hobby.

[grunts]

[grunts] Oh, thats good.

[electronic buzzing]

That is way too early.

Hes only been at work a few hours.

[buzzing]

She got the message!

[stuttering] I did. Its me.

Thats me or the cops most likely.

Oh. We are getting out of here!

[door slides shut]

[Daly] What is Space Fleet?

Ill tell you what it is.

It is a belief system... founded on the very best of human nature.

It is a goal for us to strive towards for the betterment of the universe, for the betterment of life itself.

And you assholes are fucking it up!

I did it. I did. I did it.

I sent the message. It was me.

No one else was involved, I swear.

I tried the carrot. Now meet the stick.

No, this is gonna make you happy,

Daly, cause youre sick.

And you need help.

[Lowry] No, dont, dont!

Captain.

Captain, please.

[Lowry]

OK, look, shes new. Shell behave.

Well all behave.

Just let her off. Let her off this once.

[stuttering] Please.

OK.

[gasps]

OK.

OK.

-[Nanette] No! Daly, no! No, no, no, no!

-[cracking]

-[screams, inhuman grunts]

-[cracking]

[roars]

[cracking]

[roars]

-[growls]

-[Nanette whimpers]

[gasping]

[Daly] You know what makes me happy?

The look on your face right now.

[whimpers]

[Daly] Dudani, Walton, Tulaska, take this thing to the brig with Valdack.

Packer, find a barren planet we can dump her on.

And you... can just stay here and think about your attitude.

-[sobs]

-[Daly] Exit game.

[Nanette gasping]

[distant rumbling]

[breathes heavily]

[bleeps]

Update patch.

[exhales]

The update patch.

[Nanette] Its there, there.

-So what? Its a wormhole.

-[Nanette] Unh-unh.

That is the Christmas update patch preinstalling itself.

The wormhole... its just how the game is expressing the uplink.

So?

Dalys custom build is still connected to the internet.

Some way.

If this is another one of your plans, just stop before somebody else gets monsterfied.

No, no, this... this can work.

We cant get all-in access from the ship.

Hell have crippled permissions.

Yes, but what if we fly into the wormhole?

-[scoffs] Like, on purpose?

-Wed hit the system firewall.

-Exactly. Yeah.

-And have our rogue coding deleted.

-Deleted as in...?

-As in die.

Whether its dying would depend on your position regarding sentient code--

We would cease to exist, thats true.

But wed be free.

Wed be... free.

This is academic since we have no means of getting to the wormhole.

Theres no way to pilot the damn thing without Daly here and he can stop us like that.

[snaps fingers]

What about if hes logged in but on pause?

Like when his pizza came, he was just frozen there.

Flying would be possible, but that wormholes a whole parsec away.

Wed never reach it before he got back.

[Nanette]

Unless we stalled him for longer.

[Tulaska] And that we do how?

If we can get Dalys omnicorder, we can make a phone call, right?

Theoretically, yes, but--

If we can get real me on the phone again,

I, um... I may have some leverage.

-Leverage? On yourself?

-Mm-hmm.

-Like what?

-My PhotoCloud account.

I know the password, obviously.

There are some pretty... interesting images on there that I should have deleted a while ago, but I didnt.

So, we can blackmail me.

Im pretty sure that Id do anything to keep those photos from getting out.

Must be pretty pictures.

Look, if this is going to work, we all have to be in on it.

OK?

[Walton and Packer sigh]

Flying into certain death in a wormhole beats another 10,000 years with Captain Ass.

-Im in.

-OK.

Me too.

-Also me.

-[Nanette exhales]

Well, I am out.

[Walton sighs]

Daly won. Dalys always won.

We just have to get on with it... cause we dont have a chance.

-[Nanette] Yes, we do.

-Hmm?

We fly into the wormhole and we are extinct.

We are gone. We are rid of his shit.

Sounds peachy.

What is with you?

Dont you wanna fight back?

Why wont you fight back?

Tommy.

-Who is Tommy?

-[Walton] Hes my son.

Hes six years old, at least he was when I woke up in here.

See, in the early days of this ship, it was just me and Daly.

I was his pet project.

He tried everything to break me, and I withstood it all cause I just thought there was still a chance I could get out and see my boy again.

In a way, I was right,

I did get to see him again.

Just not the real him.

Daly told me what happened.

Back on the outside, the real me, uh... brought Tommy to work one day, showed him around.

He wouldve loved seeing all those computers.

Hes really into that stuff.

Anyway, evidently...

Tommy had a lollipop that day.

Thats all Daly needed.

He copied him in here.

It was Tommy all right.

He was alike in every way.

Dad!

[Tommy]  Daddy...

You know what he did to him?

[Walton] Tommy!

He took Tommy and he threw him out of the airlock.

-[Walton] Tommy!

-Daddy!

[capsule depressurizes]

-Right out into space.

-Daddy! No!

And he made me watch.

[capsule releases]

Tommy!

Have you ever seen an unsuited body compress in space?

They freeze... and crack like a porcelain doll.

I take my hat off to Daly. [sniffles]

The detail in this place is exceptional.

And he said hed do it again and again, cause Dalys still got Tommys DNA.

Hes got all of our DNA.

He keeps it in his bedroom in a fucking mini fridge by his desk.

So I have to stay in line, because even if we die in here, he can bring us back.

He can bring Tommy back whenever he wants.

And God knows how hed take it out on him.

God knows what hed do.

So, you see, what choice do I have?

Walton.

We are gonna get that fucking lollipop.

[Walton sighs]

But you gotta believe me.

Can you do that?

Can you?

[bleeps]

[door slams]

[slurping]

[mouse clicks]

[triumphant music]

Good to see you at your position, Cole.

Captain, youve come at just the right time.

I have?

Im picking up a distress signal from the surface of Skillane IV.

Looks like a crashed shuttle.

What should we do?

Space Fleet never turns its back on those who need our help.

-Dudani, set a course for Skillane IV.

-Aye aye, sir.

Well send a search party.

Packer, Tulaska--

Actually, Captain, I was thinking maybe you could take me alone.

As science officer,

I need to learn the ropes, and I could use your close attention.

Good.

Yes, good idea.

[Nanette exhales]

[omnicorder whirs]

[Daly] Atmospheres good.

[omnicorder clicking]

[Daly] Over there.

[Daly]  From here, the shuttle appears to be deserted.

Well scout the area, check for any life forms. Daly out.

Cole, we should head out this way. Cole...

[Nanette]

Its kind of hot here, dont you think?

Oh, my God.

[Daly]  What are you doing, Cole?

[Nanette]

The water looks so inviting, doesnt it?

[Daly] What are you talking about?

[Nanette] Come on, Robert.

-Ooh!

-[splashes]

Oh, the water is great. [laughs]

Swimming is a leisure activity.

Were on Space Fleet duty.

You know what?

We could always say that I started drowning and you had to come in and rescue me.

Yeah?

Oh, what about that? [laughs]

Come on. Come on in.

[laughs] I... Cole.

-[laughs] Come on.

-Cole.

Come on.

Come on in, my big captain.

OK.

[Nanette] Come on.

Are you gonna take all day?

[Daly] OK.

-OK, Im coming in.

-[Nanette giggles]

[beeps]

OK, gotta patch it in.

[keyboard beeps]

[Dudani] It worked. Im connected.

-Gonna access her PhotoCloud account.

-You remember that password?

Uppercase Y998, lowercase gb7, uppercase TY ampersand 4.

Secure choice.

[sighs] There are thousands of images.

This could take a while.

Boring life.

[scrolling]

[scrolling]

Goddamn.

That is... gymnastic physique.

Its nice... nice bedding.

[scrolling]

Oh. OK, should I keep scrolling?

Any of the last nine would do.

Ow!

-[laughs] Thank you.

-Pleasure.

-Um, are you heading out for the night?

-Yes.

Because its Christmas Eve and weve got ten days off work to recover from it.

Go home.

-I will. I just have to finish--

-Yeah, whatever. Merry Christmas, loser.

[laughs] Yeah. OK, Merry Christmas.

[clears throat]

[phone vibrates]

[gasps]

Oh, my God.

Elliott, you fucking asshole.

[phone vibrates]

[beeps]

[robotic voice]  Nanette Cole, weve hacked your PhotoCloud account and have control of the entire contents of your photo gallery.

Who is this? Um...

[stutters] What do you want?

What we want is for you to do exactly as instructed or your entire gallery will be shared with your friends and your family.

And PornHub.

[Nanette]  OK, yeah.

[stuttering]

Ill do what you want, anything.

Ill do anything.

Then listen carefully.

We dont have much time.

Stand up, get your coat and follow our instructions.

[Nanette] OK.

[giggling]

-[Daly] Where are we going?

-Were just swimming.

Its nice, right?

-[Daly] Yes.

-Yeah. [laughs]

We should probably head back.

Help! [screams]

Something grabbed me, I think.

No, it didnt. I dont think anything did.

Im sorry.

I think I imagined it. [laughs] So stupid.

[Daly] Thats funny...

-Thats funny. [laughs]

-[Nanette] Yeah, it is funny. Its funny.

[both laugh]

[laughs]

Easy, Cole.

[panting]

-All right, Im in position.

-OK, were gonna hang up now.

Make the phone call. Be sure to complete the rest of your mission.

-I will.

-You better.

-[call ends]

-[Dudani] OK, Ill send it back down.

[Nanette laughs]

Oh! Hi. [giggles]

[Nanette] This is fucking crazy.

[line ringing]

Fenzis.

[whispering]

Yes, Id like to order a pizza.

Sure. What do you want?

[doorbell rings]

[omnicorder rings]

Oop.

I guess youd better get that.

See who...

[omnicorder rings]

-Hold on.

-Yeah.

[doorbell ringing]

[knock on door]

-Its the door.

-[Nanette] Oh, OK.

[ringing]

-Pause game.

-[whirring]

[knock on door]

[doorbell rings]

[omnicorder beeps]

-Dudani, pick me up.

-You got it. Stand by.

[doorbell rings]

-[Daly] Coming.

-[Nanette gasps]

[panting]

-Hello?

-Uh, pizza.

I didnt order a pizza.

OK, look, someone did, OK?

So do you want it or not? Because...

-I cant take it back.

-[bag unzips]

[whispers] What the hell am I doing?

-[Daly] All right!

-[door buzzes]

[panting] OK.

-Thats the signal. Shes got the DNA.

-[jacket zipping]

All of it. Tommy too.

[exhales]

Packer, we ready to fly?

Uh-huh.

Well?

Youre supposed to say something like "engage" or "increase thrust."

-Just fucking go.

-[engines revving]

There you go.

So I got it here in under ten.

Theres supposed to be 30 in it for me.

Yeah. Whats happening?

The door is closing. Hello?

Hello? Hello?

[panting] Shit...

Come on, man.

Hello? Come on, man, you promised.

[number pad beeps]

[scoffs]

-Nice. Nice. Merry Christmas, asshole!

-[thud]

[scoffs]

[muttering]

[panting]

[gasps]

Resume game.

Resume game.

Cant we go any faster? That dud disk isnt gonna fool him forever.

The update is gonna complete before long and that means bye-bye, wormhole.

The only quicker route is through that asteroid belt there.

-Lets go that way.

-No, its way too dense.

If the ship broke up we wouldnt die, wed just be left in space.

Until Daly works out whats happening.

Then hell find us and hell fuck us over.

[clattering]

-Resume game.

-[device beeps]

Lieutenant Cole, we should head...

Cole?

Daly to bridge. Whats going on?

-Shit. He has a backup disk.

-Come in, bridge.

No, dont answer him.

Dudani?

God damn it.

The wormhole, its decreasing in size.

Upload must be in the last few percent.

Damn it, Packer, we are gonna have to go through the belt.

Do you think that you can do that?

-Think I can try.

-OK.

[engine revving]

- Ships computer on.

-Computer, wheres the  USS Callister ?

USS Callister  is on course.

-On course for where?

-The wormhole.

-What wormhole?

-The update vortex.

Sons of bitches!

-Prepare for takeoff.

-[whirring]

Ive got a heat signature. Looks like a shuttle took off from Skillane IV.

Oh, God, its Daly.

[all groan]

Shields at 86%.

[banging]

[Dudani] Were taking a beating here!

[Tulaska] Incoming transmission.

[Daly]  Hello? Loyal trusty crew, come in.

I know you can hear me.

Whatever it is you think youre going to do wont work, but it is going to cost you!

-[Nanette] Lets go faster.

-Already at maximum.

Daly cant touch us unless he makes it on board, and thats shuttles a jalopy.

-He wont catch us in time.

-I hope youre right.

Shields 58%.

[crashing]

If you thought what happened to you in the past was bad, that was nothing!

What Im going to do to you is going to be goddamn fucking biblical!

Im literally going to turn your insides out.

But Ill keep you alive in tiny little jars and there youll stay until Im bored of you--

-Why are we listening to this?

-Yes, fuck him!

[beeps]

Were at the edge of the belt.

I think were gonna make it.

-[crashing]

-[alarm sounds]

[power dies]

-[gasps] What was that?

-[Dudani] Primary drive.

Ive lost all thrust.

Engines not responding.

Were drifting here.

-USS Callister  has lost engine power.

-[laughs]

Im coming to get you! Hello! [laughs]

[Nanette] Is there any way that we can fix the engines?

Thats only feasible manually, by climbing inside the jet fader.

[Nanette] So...?

So youd burn to a crisp when the jet came on.

-[Dudani] Wed burn without dying.

-So one of us needs to go. OK.

[Walton over speaker]

One of us already has.

Walton?

Im pretty sure I can fix this.

Um, uh... Walton, are you sure about this?

Im sure. [echoing]

Tulaska, can you patch me through to Daly?

[Tulaska]  Patching through.

[Walton panting]

Hey, Daly, can you hear me?

-Walton?

-Robert? Hey.

-Walton, youre going to pay for this.

-Robert, listen.

-Im going to bring Tommy back in.

-Hey, Robert--

God so help me, you are going to regret all of this so hard!

Bob, I wanna talk to you here!

I was thinking I should say... sorry.

Go on.

You created  Infinity .

Youre a fucking genius.

I exploited that.

I treated you like a golden goose and I got fat on the profits, figuratively speaking.

[exhales]

And I was thinking I should have appreciated you more, you know?

I should have treated you better.

Yeah, yeah, I was thinking

I should say all that.

[Walton exhales]

But you threw my son out of an airlock, so fuck you to death.

[screams]

[screams echo]

Walton?

Walton?

-[power boots up]

-[engine whirring]

Weve got power back.

-Faster!

-[computer]  Speed already at maximum.

I dont care, whatever, just catch them!

[alarm beeps]

Wormhole almost closed.

Dalys gaining on us.

-Keep her steady. Keep steady.

-Im trying.

Come on, come on.

I hope we are going to die.

Goddamn it!

Damn it! Fuck!

[all scream]

[screaming continuing]

[electronics whirring]

What happened?

The mods gone.

Dalys Space Fleet mod has been stripped away by the firewall.

-OK, so... this is good.

-[Packer] Were still alive.

[Dudani]

Yeah, it only erased the Space Fleet mod.

[Nanette]

Were not on Dalys computer anymore.

-Were in the cloud.

-[Tulaska] Where is Daly?

Firewalls deleted his rogue game code, and his controls were disabled.

-You mean...?

-Hes stuck there.

[laughs]

[computer]

Update complete. Wormhole closed.

-[beeping]

-[clicking]

-Controls are disabled.

-No.

[Daly] No. No, no, no!

[doors open]

-[Lowry] Assholes!

-[Valdack] Hey!

-[Valdack] Yeah! Whats up?

-The brig unlocked itself.

My Valdack outfit turned into this.

More to the point,

Im not a beetle thing anymore.

Ive got my body back.

Ive got my whole body back.

Im guessing we all have.

So what do we do now?

Weve got an infinite procedurally generated universe at our disposal.

We can go anywhere.

Holy mackerel.

-[computer]  Rogue universe detected.

-It says Gamer691.

-Thats a player tag.

Another ship, another player.

-Hey, patch em through.

-[beeps]

-Um, hello.

-[Gamer691]  Hey there.

Uh, this is the crew of the  USS Callister.

[laughs]

Oh, man, are we glad to hear from--

Yeah, Merry Christmas. So are we gonna blow each other or are we gonna trade?

Oh... Hmm.

Hello. Do you have anything to trade at all?

-[Nanette] No, uh--

- [sighs]  So why did you respond?

OK, just get the hell out of my quadrant or Ill blast you to shit.

-You got ten seconds. Ten...

-Oh, well, do... do try.

Well photon-bolt you up the perineum, you stupid little boy.

-Scary. Nine.

-Come on, then.

-Yes, thank you, Shania. Um...

-Eight.

-Nate?

-Yes, Captain?

Stick us in hyperwarp and lets...

## 2. Arkangel



[man] How are the pressures and saturation?

[nurse] Pressures are good.

Oxygen saturation is 100%.

-Feel anything?

-No. -[nurse] How about now?

-Mnh-mnh.

[nurse] And when he does that?

Nothing.

[nurse] OK. All set, then.

[surgeon] Making initial incision.

Hand me the Bovie.

We've entered the peritoneum.

I can't believe I couldn't do it.

I couldn't push anymore.

[nurse] Don't be ridiculous.

Don't apologize.

[surgeon] We've moved the bladder.

Here's the uterine incision. -[woman] Oh, God...

-Hey, it's gonna be fine.

I won't tell anybody if you want to hold my hand.

[surgeon] OK, we're ready now.

How are the vitals?

[nurse] Still good.

You're gonna feel a little pressure now.

-Uh-huh. -[surgeon] Occiput is visible

-and... baby is out. -[laughs]

[surgeon] Cutting the umbilical cord. -[woman] Is she OK? -[doctors mutter]

What is it?

What's...

[doctors continue muttering]

-Say she's OK. -[nurse] Hey, hey, hey. It's OK.

Oh, God! Oh, God... -[sobs] Is she OK? -[nurse] Just relax. Hold on. OK? -[baby cries] -[surgeon] Good job.

[nurse] She's great.

Oh, she's beautiful.

[baby gurgles]

[doctors murmur indistinctly]

One, two, three and open your mouth and eat this down, OK?

One, two, three, boo.

-No, no. Big "ah" and in it goes. -[chuckles]

So, that's how it's gonna be, huh, soldier?

I'm not a soldier.

[woman] You want me to take over?

I think your mother should know by now that your grandfather's not a quitter. -[mother chuckles]

-One, two, three, and...

I want to take Sara to the park.

You want to come?

No, I'm gonna pass if you don't mind.

I'd like to get at that painting, get it finished.

-Mm, the horse?

-Yeah.

-Yep. Have a good time. -[Sara giggles] -[dog barks] -[Sara] Oh! No, no.

[Sara] Mommy.

-Here we are! -[squeals, laughs]

[mother chuckles]

[laughs] -[woman] Marie? -[Marie gasps] -[woman laughs] -[Marie squeals] Hi!

[woman] I thought it was you.

-This is Mikey. -[Marie gasps]

-Hello, little guy. -[woman] Yeah.

Hey, there. -[Marie] How old is he?

-He's seven months. -[Marie] Wow. Congratulations. -[woman] Yeah. Thank you.

[Sara] Kitty! -[woman] I'm so tired. -[Marie] Yeah.

[Marie laughs]

Hopefully he'll sleep through the night one of these days.

Yeah, well, you're past that.

How old's Sara now?

Sara is three and she's... Sara!

Sara!

Come say hi to this little boy.

Sara? -[tense music]

-Sara? -[man] Sara! -[woman] Sara!

-Sara! -[woman] Sara!

[man] Sara! -[woman] Mommy's looking for you!

Sara!

-Hey, it's OK. We're gonna find her.

-Stop! -[man] Hey, hey, lady!

-Sara!

[man] I found her!

[man] She was down by the track.

Fallen down the slope. -[Marie sobs]

-Said she... she followed a cat?

-She followed a cat. -[Marie whispers] I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

I'm right here.

Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

[sobs]

-Miss Sambrell?

-Yes.

And Sara, right? Follow me.

You have a recommendation, so Sara will be part of our trial period.

-Well, it's been tested though, right?

-Of course.

-I mean, she's not, like, a guinea pig.

-It's all fully tested, perfectly safe.

This is just us fine-tuning our subscription model before the full launch.

[Marie] Look at the kids.

We're getting feedback on which features our customers use most in the real world. -[Marie] Uh-huh.

-Do you wanna go up? Yeah!

Response so far is just incredible.

The sense of security, peace of mind.

I mean, the stories we've been hearing, they're inspirational. -[Sara giggles, chatters]

-Can you see the screen?

-OK, then. -[woman] There you go.

-You like cartoons?

-Yeah.

Yeah? Shimmer and Shine?

-Uh-huh.

-Mm-hmm. OK.

Then you watch that and I won't be a moment. OK?

[chattering on TV]

[chattering]

[device whirs]

[device beeps]

-That's it? -[woman] Mm-hmm. That's it.

So...

Let's get you all set up.

-I'll run you through everything. OK? -[Marie] OK. -[woman] Feel free to ask any questions.

-Mm-hmm. -[woman] This is your parental hub. -[tablet beeps]

I'm just pairing it with Sara's implant.

OK. We're all set. -[tablet beeps]

-So, this is Sara's current location, which is here, of course.

[Marie] Oh, look at that.

Now, if she ever goes missing, all you have to do is tap here, enter your PIN, and law enforcement is automatically notified.

Wow, OK. -[tablet beeps] -[woman] These are her vitals.

Healthy heartbeat. Oh, I see her iron levels are a little low.

How is she eating?

[sighs] Man, she's picky.

Um, she hates greens, so--

You might want to think about nutritional supplements.

-OK. -[tablet beeps]

Now, tap this icon here... -[Marie] Mm-hmm.

-...to relay her optic feed.

[Marie] This is what she's seeing now?

[woman] That's right.

-Whoa. [laughs] -[laughs]

[Marie] That's amazing.

Mommy! It's funny.

And there are parental controls you can apply to that.

-Uh, controls?

-Content limitations.

If she witnesses something that causes her cortisol levels to rise, like stress, it can kind of paint out whatever's triggering it.

-Let me show you.

-OK.

[tablet beeps] -[Marie] Ooh.

-It's OK. Look.

See, the imagery causes a cortisol spike, and this... -[clear sound effects] -[tablet] Filter on. -[muffled shouts]

-...is what she sees and hears.

[Marie chuckles] Whoa. OK.

Yeah, I'm not sure that we'll... -[tablet beeps]

-It's all optional.

OK.

How much?

Nothing. It's a free trial.

-Oh, free. -[Marie scoffs]

-Yeah.

-Yeah.

And it's completely safe.

I'm sure it is, honey.

-I am 2,000 years old... -[sighs]

...and I remember when we used to open up the door and just let the kids be.

Mm. And I remember breaking my arm because you wouldn't get a baby gate.

And how is the arm now?

[scoffs]

Feels OK.

[Sara] Are you there? Mommy!

Where are you?

Mommy?

Are you here?

[giggles quietly]

Mommy?

-Oh, what's up, sweetheart?

-I'm looking for Mommy.

You're looking for Mommy?

I got no idea where she's at.

Upstairs. Go on. Go look upstairs.

[giggles quietly] -[Sara] Mommy, where are you?

-Yoo-hoo!

Mommy, I hear you.

I'm gonna find you.

[laughs louder]

[Sara laughs] I hear you, Mommy. -[Marie] Ah! -[Sara screams]

[both laugh]

[dog barks]

[tablet beeps]

[tablet] Filter on.

[dog growls]

[barks ferociously]

[muffled dog barks]

[door creaks and closes]

[blender whirs]

You guys gonna be all right?

I raised you all right. You turned out OK.

Took you a while, but you did.

All right, sweetheart. I'll see you later.

Terrorize your grandpa. He can handle it.

[Sara] Bye.

[Marie] Bye.

Orange straw.

-OK, just push on my hand. OK.

-Yeah. [grunts]

Relax.

-Again. Is that all you got? -[laughs]

I think the range is getting better.

So how long till I can get back on the bike again, you think?

[sighs] I'd say two weeks and maybe don't drive so fast.

Yeah, right.

OK. So, same time next week?

Uh, no, actually it's got to be Thursday.

I got plans Monday.

Something exciting?

Girlfriend's folks are in town, so nope.

-Oh, well, uh, Thursday it is. -[phone beeps]

Oh, I'm liking yours. That's the way.

You're not shy about using color, are you?

That's the way a real artist...

[Sara] I'm gonna try this...

[exhales] Sorry, honey. Just, uh...

[sighs] Grandpa's gotta sit...

[mumbles]

[groans]

[grunts] Ah!

[grandfather groans]

[moans]

-Grandpa? -[mumbles]

Huh? Sara...

[grandfather mutters]

[phone rings]

[phone continues ringing]

[tablet rings]

[tablet rings louder]

[grandfather mutters]

[groans] Sara...

Oh, my God!

[grandfather breathes heavily]

OK, very good.

-The nurse left your thing on.

-Yeah, she probably forgot to take it off.

-I'll get it.

-I can get it. [exhales deeply]

[grandfather coughs]

-You good? -[grandfather] Quit bugging me. Jeez.

[Marie] There you go.

[grandfather] It's warm in here.

I don't need that.

Give me that.

[tablet beeps] -[chattering on TV]

-Hey, Sara! One cookie.

[Marie] Bad for your teeth.

[grandfather] Thanks.

[Marie sniffles]

What color for the hair?

Mom?

Uh, whatever you want.

But I'd say brunette.

[barks loudly]

[muffled barking]

[continues barking loudly]

[children talking]

[boy 1] He's got his arms in the air.

He's given up.

-He's got a stick out and... [gasps] -[boy 2 groans]

-He just, like, pounds on him.

-Turn it off, Trick. It's gross.

What is it?

Great. The walking snitch. -[girl] She never snitches. -[boy 2] She's just weird.

-I want to know what you're watching.

-What do you care, chip-head?

It's parental advisory. You're locked out.

I want to know.

You're better off not seeing it.

Wish I never did.

What if I tell you what's in it?

That work?

So, he brings it down, like, wham!

There's all this blood.

You seen much blood?

It's like juice. Thick, red juice.

Then the guy on the ground is all, like, "Hell, no!"

And he keeps... [muffled speech]

[muffled speech continues]

[Marie] Oh, it's too much.

I'm fine to have my face on the flier, but on the poster, it's like,

"Look at me."

[tablet rings]

Sara, what are you doing?

[groans] Sara!

[breathes heavily]

What's happening in this picture?

[doctor] Are they happy or...

[Sara] They're talking.

[doctor] Just talking?

[Sara] I don't know what about.

[doctor] OK. Next one. [sighs] -[doctor] How about that one? -[Sara] I don't know.

[doctor] Is she happy?

[Marie]

So is this, like, an autism thing?

The spectrum is wide, but in my opinion, she's not on it.

But what about the pencils, like, self-harm?

And these pictures are... [sighs]

Has Sara ever shown any undue anger before now?

No.

Well, then consider this part experiment, part acting out, for your benefit.

[Marie sighs]

The Arkangel never launched nationwide.

It was banned in Europe.

It'll be pulled here, too, by the fall.

I did this to her.

You can't remove the implant, but you can get rid of the parental unit.

The screen.

Just throw it away. Problem solved.

[tablet beeps] Filter off.

Goodbye.

[tablet shuts down]

You're gonna be on your own today. OK?

No Arkangel.

The system isn't gonna be on.

OK? So, no fuzzy pictures.

And you won't see me?

[sighs] I won't see you.

But, you do not have to be afraid.

I'm right down the street.

-You won't know if something happens?

-Nothing is gonna happen.

It's important that we do this.

[whispers] You're gonna be fine.

[exhales] Be good, sweetie.

[sighs]

[phone beeps]

[dog growls] -[dog barks] -[gasps]

[barks loudly] -[man] Watch out! -[car horn honks]

[man in car] Watch it, kid.

[sighs]

[barks] -[tablet beeps] -[exhales]

Come on, come on, come on. -[tablet beeps] -[sighs]

[sigh of relief]

[children laughing, chattering]

[child groans]

[woman] OK! OK, this is enough! -[boy] Don't touch my stuff again, Trick.

-Yeah? I'll do what I want.

What do you want?

Are you OK?

Yeah, sure.

My dad's gonna see this and then bust it all over again, 'cause I got in trouble.

Ever seen a bust lip before?

Mm... Not till now.

She turned the system off.

[Trick] OK...

-This is porn. Like, people doing it. -[woman moaning]

They can't make babies that way.

They have to do it different for that. -[shouting]

-So this one's got a hacksaw and he's gotta cut his own foot off.

-So, the terrorist guy... -[shouting]

...OK, OK, keep an eye on the knife.

See?

-He's gonna take his whole head off! -[men scream]

[blender whirs]

[Marie] Be good, sweetie.

[barks]

Hey. Good boy, Petey.

You hang on in there.

[whirs]

-You added something.

-Oh, it's like a new kind of probiotic.

-It keeps your stools firm.

-Oh, Jesus, Mom.

[rock music playing]

Oh, you've got to be kidding!

When was the last time you went anywhere?

That's not dancing. [laughs]

[Sara] She said he was English.

-He's not English.

-He said "cup of tea," or something.

Doesn't mean anything.

Susan's an idiot. [chuckles]

Hey, it's Trick.

Holy fuck, he's got wheels!

[girl] Yo, Trick!

Hey, guys. What's up?

-Interesting hair.

-Shut up.

I'm fucking with you. It's cool.

[laughs]

-How are you doing?

-Didn't know you cared.

Maybe I don't.

-You a delivery guy now?

-Kinda, of sorts.

-Shut up. -[laughs]

Hmm... So intriguing. I gotta go.

Hey, uh, we're headed to Lake Dalston later if you girls want to hang.

We'll think about it. -[Trick] It'll be fun. -[boy] Why don't you just come?

Come on!

[girl] Like my dad's gonna let me set foot in Trick's van.

[Sara] Look, we tell our folks we're at Reilly's for movie night.

Oh, come on, it'll work.

It's worth a shot, I guess.

So, anyhow...

-You and, uh, Trick, huh?

-What?

[scoffs] I'm not gonna do anything.

-Yeah, OK. [laughs] Sure.

-Oh, fuck you!

[laughs] Hey!

[laughing] -[door opens]

-Yay! You're home.

Not for long. I was gonna go to Reilly's with Meryl. Movie night.

Oh, I thought movie night was on Wednesday.

Her mom's got guests over then, so we're doing tonight.

Gonna watch some vintage thing.

The Breakfast Gang.

[laughs] The Breakfast Club.

[laughs] That's it.

Um, be home, like, 11:30.

Her mom will drop me back.

Well, I might be heading out, too. So...

-Really?

-Yeah, really.

OK. Last one home's a rotten egg.

OK!

[pop music playing]

[music continues playing loudly]

[muffled music]

[phone beeps] -[inhales, exhales] -[phone beeps]

[line ringing] -[man] Hey, there. How you doing? -[sighs]

You look hot. Later.

I don't know... -[chattering] -[rock music playing]

[laughing]

[both laugh]

She called me fat. I got over it.

I still remember it... [laughs]

-Would you like some?

-Yeah, sure.

[coughs, laughs]

[Trick laughs] -[laughs] What was that? -[boy] I heard it.

[chuckles] -[Sara moans]

-Cold?

Only a bit. [sighs]

[Trick] Come here.

[moans, sighs]

It's late.

I should go.

Same time next week?

[kisses]

[voicemail] Hi, it's Sara.

Leave a message. Make it good.

Hey, it's Mom. All right, call me.

OK? All right, bye.

[phone beeps] -[woman] Hey.

-Hi, Ava. I was just wondering if the girls were done with the movie.

[Ava] What movie? -Breakfast Club?

-They never ended up here.

-They didn't?

-No. Do you want to speak to Reilly?

I don't know.

I must have got my wires crossed.

-OK, thanks.

-All right. -[woman] Hello?

-Hi, it's Marie.

I was wondering if Sara and Meryl were together.

They said they were headed down to Reilly's.

No, I haven't seen them.

-Hi, it's Marie, Sara's mom. -[man] Oh, hi.

-Yeah, I was just--

-What's up?

-Have you heard from her?

-Uh... no.

I'm sorry, I know it's late.

I was wondering, have you seen her? -[woman] No. Everything OK?

-No, everything's fine.

[voicemail] Hi, it's Sara.

Leave a message. Make it good.

Um, hey, it's Mom.

Where are you? Call me.

[voicemail] Hi, it's Sara.

Leave a message. Make it good.

Sara?

Sara? -[tablet beeps] -[sighs]

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

[sighs]

Come on, come on!

[whispers] Come on, come on, come on.

[tablet beeps]

What is that?

[heavy breathing on tablet]

[Sara] Fuck me harder.

[panting]

[Sara] Fuck me.

-Oh, God, oh... -[Sara moans] Please. -[tablet beeps]

-Oh.

[whimpers] Oh.

[sighs]

[sobs] Oh...

[Sara] Here. Let me do it.

-My hands are warm. -[exhales]

-You gotta be a liar.

-What?

You said you'd never done that before.

No way you never done that before.

Swear to God.

You know, you didn't have to talk like that.

Like what?

Like the porn stuff.

I mean, like, you don't have to talk like that... for me.

OK. -[laughs]

-What?

[chuckles] Just... just you.

What about me?

You know...

You've got muscles, but...

[whispers] ...you're a pussy.

-Yeah. -[both laugh]

[loud knock on door]

I'm busted.

My mom knows I'm not at Reilly's.

-Huh? -[Meryl] Yeah, I mean...

We gotta go, OK?

-Come on.

-Fuck.

[sighs]

[dog barks in distance]

[Sara] No lights. [sighs]

Maybe she's still out.

Pretty sure she had a date.

Maybe she got laid. -[snorts, laughs] -[laughs] Oh, please, that's gross.

-Sorry.

-Check out that laugh. [chuckles]

-Yeah? [laughs] -[laughs] Yeah.

Later.

[chuckles] -[door closes] -[tablet beeps]

Sara?

-Sorry, Mom. I am a little late.

-It's OK.

How was Reilly?

She's great.

I gotta go to bed.

-OK.

-Night, Mom.

I love you.

[bedroom door shuts]

[sighs]

Hmm, probiotics.

I gotta go. I'm gonna be a little late back from school.

Oh, yeah?

Said I'd help Meryl with a project.

She's being a dork about it, so...

-OK.

-See ya!

Bye!

[door slams] -[Marie] Have a good afternoon. -[woman] Thank you, dear.

[sighs]

All right. What do you think?

OK, that's awesome, but I can't put that on the van.

-Why not?

-Well, A, it's not my van, and, B, it's better if I'm anonymous.

For your special delivery?

Maybe, yeah.

-You got any on you?

-Any what?

Oh, come on, Trick.

I'm not dumb. I know what you sell.

You got any?

It's not for you.

Bet it's in your backpack. -[giggles] Under the seat... with tape.

-Sara, come here.

-Hey, Sara, give me that.

-Duct tape.

Give me that. No, no, no. -[squeals] I bet it's in the pocket.

-Come on, give me that. No!

I'm making a little money on the side so I can move out, OK?

It's not like I use that shit.

Have you tried it?

Of course I've tried it but, I mean, it's not even good coke, it's, like, average.

It's for people who like to talk about themselves all the time. Yada yada yada.

-Show me what it looks like.

-Mm-mm.

Come on. I just want to see.

Please.

Are you sure it's not sugar?

-Go away. -[both laugh]

So, one of the things people do is they put it, like...

-under their gum, bottom gum.

-OK.

So...

Oh, ew... -[retches] Gross. -[both laugh]

All right, let's, uh, let's put it back.

-I don't think you should--

-I want to try some.

Just a little, just once.

Just once.

[Trick sighs]

[tablet rings]

[tablet beeps]

[sniffs]

[Sara] Whoa!

[shouts] Ah!

[tablet beeps]

[Marie exhales] -[woman] Hi, can I help?

-I'm just looking.

Ma'am?

Excuse me? Are you Ryan Tribecky?

-You stay away from my daughter.

-Uh... I don't know what--

Sara. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You stay away.

-OK, she's--

-She is 15, you junkie piece of shit.

You want the cops in on this?

-I didn't do anything.

-I will show them what you did.

OK, you stay away from her, or I will show them this. OK?

You still got that system?

Yes, I have it. So whatever she sees,

I see, and I am watching you.

-OK.

-So you stay away.

OK, if she calls you, you hang up.

If she comes to see you, you tell her to get away.

-You just stay away from her.

-I'll stay away.

-You stay the fuck away. -[breathes heavily]

-Hey, Mom.

-Hey.

[footsteps going upstairs]

Please try again.

[knock on door]

[Marie] Sara?

Hey, dinner's ready.

I'm not hungry.

It's Mexican.

Please, I just... [sighs]

I'm tired, and I want to sleep, OK?

OK.

[tablet beeps]

So you're cutting me out.

Standard dick move.

That's what this is, right?

[Sara scoffs] Look at me.

-Why can't you just look at me?

-It was a mistake.

It didn't seem like a mistake from where I was laying.

I can't be with you.

What the fuck?

[Trick] I don't want to be with you.

I don't want you, OK?

You know what?

Fuck you.

[tablet rings]

[exhales]

[car alarm sounds in distance]

-Hey, Mom.

-Hey.

[whirring]

[door shuts]

OK, so why is he so down?

Oedipus says things like:

"Let the storm burst, my fixed resolve still holds." Or:

"Nothing can make me other than what I am."

He still holds himself morally responsible.

He doesn't blame fate for what's happened to him.

Moral responsibility implies the existence of free will, but actually... [continues indistinct]

[gags]

[school bell rings]

[Sara vomits, coughs]

-You feeling any better?

-Uh-huh.

So, listen... [sighs]

I had to run some tests, in case we had a noro outbreak here.

Honey, it was the EC pill that made you sick.

-EC?

-Emergency contraception.

For terminating your pregnancy.

[scoffs] There's no...

There's no pregnancy.

Seriously, I'm... I'm not...

I can't... I haven't...

I understand, sweetheart.

And it will work, in spite of the vomiting.

You don't have to worry about that.

You're not pregnant anymore.

I gotta put it in your file, but I don't have to flag it.

And I want you to know I got your back.

[tablet beeps]

[heavy breathing]

[Sara sighs] Please.

Sara?

Sara?

[tablet beeps]

[tablet beeps]

You watched me.

No, I... honey...

-Honey...

-You watched me with him.

-I... No, I didn't mean to.

-Give it to me. -[strains]

-Give it...

I was trying to protect you.

I was trying to keep you safe.

[Sara] How do you turn it off?

-Everything I've done, I've done for you. -[tablet malfunctions] -[Marie] Honey, I love you--

-Shut up! -[thud] -[Marie gasps] Sara--

Shut up!

[Marie screams] Sara! Sara! -[Sara groans] -[Marie screams] -[Marie sobs] Sara-- -[grunts]

[Marie wails] -[Marie screams] -[Sara grunting]

[tablet] Filter off, off, off...

Off...

[Marie coughs]

[sobs] Sara?

Sara?

[Mia] Um, it's an honor to be speaking here today amongst such impressive company.

Uh, I'm thrilled to have been shared--

I'm thrilled to have been asked to share my vision of the future, such as it is.

Looking around at a world of injustice, intolerance and huge environmental challenges, it's hard to imagine a bright future, but we can and we must.

It's the only way that we can build a better tomorrow.

[Mia] Um...

So I'll start with a funny story.

It's been like two years now, hasn't it?

Uh, three.

Dropping in on my hotel room, it must be important.

-Shall we find somewhere to eat?

-Yeah, well, I...

I got in touch 'cause I saw that you were in town for what is it, some, some architecture thing?

It's a forum, they call it.

People actually pay to come and listen to me talk. [scoffs]

Imagine that.

Almost does my head in. [laughs]

And you're looking good.

Is that the gym?

Well, you look--

I look like dog shit, Mia.

I'll save you the bother.

Dried-up dog shit. -[Mia] Do you want a drink?

-I knocked it on the head.

What, you quit, like fully quit?

[Rob] Nine months, three weeks, two days.

Well done. Well, that's great.

You go ahead.

-Really, go on.

-You sure?

-Absolutely.

-OK.

[Mia] You picked a terrible place to come see me 'cause it reeks of hops all the way down the street outside here.

-Did you notice that? -[Rob] No. -[Mia] It's like a full-on beer smell. -[bottle opening, fizzing]

Can't help your sobriety, that.

But I probably shouldn't be talking about booze, should I? [sighs]

Rob, I hope you're not here to talk about what I--

It's about that, yeah.

I've been thinking about it again, that night. -[Mia] Rob.

-I can't not think about it.

We said that we'd put it out of our minds.

Weren't we just gonna try and keep it out?

[Rob] I can't. I'm sorry.

It was a long time ago.

Well, in here, it's now.

Yeah, I know.

Why today?

Why is it preying on your mind today? -[Rob] There's a news story.

-A news story?

[paper rustles]

Uh, a featured article.

Well, whatever you call it.

[stammers] I printed it for you.

Mia?

That-- That's her. It's his wife.

-You don't know that's his wife.

-There is a photo of him at the bottom.

It's him.

And the poor cunt, they never found him.

So she never remarried.

She never fucking moved house.

She stayed where she is in case he came back.

All this time, Mia, she's still waiting for him.

That's dreadful. But what can we do?

I'm gonna write her a letter.

-No.

-Anonymous.

-I am not gonna mention you.

-Rob, no.

You'll open up God knows what, you'll just rake it all up. -[stammers] I can't live with it, Mia.

-There's things they can do.

'Cause they can trace it back.

They can trace it.

They'll find the body, they'll find us.

-They won't find us.

-Yes, they will, then we're fucked.

Look, when I quit alcohol, they told me to make amends with anyone I've ever hurt.

Who have I hurt more than her?

Also say you're not supposed to hurt anyone else. What about me?

-What about her?

-No, no, no.

No.

No! Fuck!

[exhales, whimpers]

It was your idea.

It was your fucking idea! -[Rob] I know. I know, and I'm sorry. -[sobs]

Fifteen years, 15 years, the fucking shame, the fucking guilt!

I've got somewhere. I've got a life.

You don't know, don't understand.

[Rob] That's not the point, though.

-You don't understand. -[scoffs]

You're not married.

I've got a son. He's nine years old.

You've seen photos of him.

Think of him, please.

I'm sorry.

[Rob sighs]

I sat on this for you.

-I fucking sat on this for you!

-I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

Hey, look at me.

[sniffles]

[sighs]

Look at me.

I've made up my mind, and that's how it is.

Please, please, please.

Please, please, please, Rob.

Hey, listen, I understand. I understand.

Do you?

Yeah. Come on, let's talk about this.

No, no, I can't stay here. -[Mia] No, no, no, no.

-What are you doing? Let go!

Mia, I'm fucking leaving.

[Rob] What are you doing?

Mia, let the-- Mia, let the fuck--

Let the fuck-- go! -[crashing] -[Rob] Fuck... -[Mia sobs]

-Ah!

[head cracks]

[man] Codger.

That's his name, Codger. [laughs]

-What? -[guinea pig squeaks]

-Ah, you don't like him.

-Oh, it's not that.

-It's so hard to get presents for you.

-No, I like him. He's... fluffy. [laughs]

Exactly. No, Ali's gonna love him.

It's just we've got a lot going on, what with Ali and...

I'll take him back. The pet shop guy was OK. It won't be a problem.

No, no, no, no, you're right.

It'll be good for Ali.

Codger stays.

-He's... Codger the lodger. -[laughs]

Um...

Did he? Oh, that's great.

No, don't put him on.

[sighs]

Hi, hey.

Hey, Dad said you were great in your rehearsal for your play.

You had a good rehearsal?

Yeah, I'm proud of you.

Yeah.

I love you. -[clanging] -[chattering]

[chains jangle]

[exhaling, grunting]

[sizzling]

[body crashing, sizzling]

[typing]

So that's one night.

You had room service and a £9.99 charge for the movie.

For a movie?

You... you watched a film last night, no?

Yeah. I was in last night, yeah.

[card reader bleeps]

Thanks.

-Thank you. -[elevator dings]

[alarm blares in distance]

[knocking]

I'm from Realm Insurance, about the pizza van accident.

[man] Oh, come in.

[woman] I mean, it'll cover you for up to four months, but that is quite a substantial claim.

Well, I was heading off on tour with the Philharmonic next week.

Europe, Middle East, Australia.

-Not now.

-Mm.

As I'm sure you appreciate, with a payout of this size,

-we will need to investigate the accident.

-Yeah, of course.

Now, that stretch of the street has a security camera, vandalized, by some kids, I'm guessing, paintballed right in the wrong place.

But the, um... delivery van thing must've had a camera.

-Not working.

-Oh, for God's sake.

No, that's actually good for your claim.

Fences Pizza's a big company.

They've been claiming their driverless fleet has a good record.

[man scoffs]

The malfunctioning camera, that's a step toward negligence.

So if we can prove full liability, you could also consider filing a substantial civil case under our litigation wing?

Could be a lot of money.

Yeah, OK, I'm sold.

Great. [chuckles]

Now, I'll just hook you up

-to the recaller here. -[whirring] -[man] It's one of those memory dredgers? -[bleeps]

[woman laughs] We prefer "corroborators." -[man] Police things, aren't they?

-Mm... Not since last year.

We all have them now.

Right.

-May I?

-Yeah. -[man] I feel like a specimen. -[laughs]

[suctions, bleeps]

[woman] So, this accesses engrams, your memories of what happened.

Now, they're subjective.

They may not be totally accurate, and they're often emotional, but by collecting a range of recollections from yourself and any witnesses, we can help build a corroborative picture of the whole.

[man] I don't remember anything.

It's a total blank.

Oh, I've got something that might help.

[man] What, getting drunk?

The accident happened a few hundred meters from the Castle Port Brewery.

[bottle fizzes]

The whole area smells like a pub.

No sipping, just take a sniff.

Aroma's a great memory boost, helps anchor you

-to where you were. -[sniffs]

Oh... that's familiar.

OK. Now, hold that smell in your mind, close your eyes and picture the street.

[man exhales]

[bleeping, whirring]

[woman] Getting something now.

-Yeah. I went to a sort of comic shop... -[static whirring]

[man] Culty stuff. Um...

I think it started snowing when I came out.

Heavy snow, um...

There was music from a car. -[bleeping] -["Anyone Who Knows What Love Is" playing]

I like that song.

[man] There was a woman in a yellow coat coming towards me.

[woman] Good recall on her face.

She had this weird lipstick on.

It stood out.

And she's pretty. -[music continues]

-Um, yeah, yeah, and that, too.

Well, the more emotional your response, the more vivid your memory of it is.

So there was the music and a girl, and then what happened?

[man] Well, I went to cross the road, wasn't really thinking about anything,

-and, uh... -[car screeching]

And that's just when it just goes. Um...

That's OK.

What you've given me is already useful. -[man] Really? -[video rewinds]

[woman] Well, I've got someone to look for, Little Miss Yellow Coat.

-Hey. -[man] Ah, the wanderer returns.

-Yeah.

-You don't know how to fix this, do you?

Um, yeah, I'll have a look at it later. -[boy] Hi, Mom. -[Mia] Hi, you.

-School musical, Bugsy Malone.

-[clears throat]

You all right?

Yeah. Yeah.

They've got this, um, sound system for the backing tracks that they can't work out and I said I'd help them out.

So... I'm gonna be there all day.

You're gonna die of loneliness here, are you?

[Mia] Yeah, I'll be fine.

[man] Well, we'll see you later, 7:30. -[Mia] Mm-hmm.

-Don't forget.

I won't. -[man] See ya. -[boy] See you later.

[Mia] Bye.

[distant sirens]

[phone bleeps]

[engine fires up, beeping]

[candy bag rustles]

[woman] It was only yesterday.

You're efficient.

The fresher the memory, the stronger it is, and the stronger the memory, the stronger the case.

I'll also just get you to take a sniff of this. -[bottle fizzes] -[laughs]

[laughs] God knows what they think we're doing in here.

[laughs]

If you close your eyes,

I'm also gonna play a piece of music.

["Anyone Who Knows What Love Is" playing]

God, yeah, yeah, that, that was on.

How weird.

Hold those things in your mind and picture what you saw. -[music continues] -[sniffing]

I was on Stanhope Road, near the hotel place, looking at flats and stuff, you know, window shopping.

I saw this guy walking towards me.

I remember thinking he looked sort of sweet.

The music was coming from the car, which pulled off.

Actually that was when the delivery thing drove past.

[static buzzing]

Fences Pizza?

What sort of speed was it going?

You mean, was it going too fast?

Um...

-Try and focus on the vehicle.

-Maybe. -[woman] Um... -[bleeping]

[sighs] Um...

I don't know. I couldn't really say.

What about the impact itself?

Well, I didn't really see it.

I just saw the aftermath, really.

[crashing, man screaming] -[video bleeps] -[controller clicks]

[screaming replays]

[video bleeps]

A moment earlier you saw a bright light?

Yeah. Like a camera flash just before.

Just outside the dentist place. -[recaller beeps]

-Hmm.

[scrubbing]

[doorbell buzzes]

[woman] And I'm assuming your window glazing's soundproof. -[dentist] Yes, we get the odd screamer.

-I won't bother with the music then.

Look, to be honest, the memory's a bit embarrassing--

-Don't worry, I've seen it all.

-Do you have to use that thing?

Look, your memories will be sealed and private.

Unless they indicate you're harming yourself or another person.

Go on then.

[suctions, bleeping]

[sighs]

[recaller bleeping]

[crunches on candy]

[static bleep]

[dentist] I'd had a patient.

Hmm, so I see.

[dentist] She left around six, I think.

I stayed to clear up.

You saw something from the window?

[dentist sighs]

There was a guy in the hotel window.

Well, what can I say?

[dentist] He was picturesque.

[controller clicking]

[woman] Did you take a photo? -[candy crunching] -[dentist] Well, I tried to.

I left the flash on by mistake, so all I got was the reflection.

[camera shutter clicks] -[woman] And then?

-I was going to take another one.

I saw some woman staring at something.

So I looked down, it was just a load of commotion.

[dentist] There was a woman in a sort of lime coat.

[crunching] Hmm, yellow actually. -[dentist] Well, I knew it was vivid.

-Well, memories can be subjective.

What we do is build up an overall average, a crowd-sourced picture of reality.

[recaller bleeps]

Did you see the vehicle that hit the pedestrian?

Any sense of its speed?

I didn't see the actual crash, sorry.

[beeping, whirring]

OK. [exhales]

-You won't tell anyone about the photo? -[recaller bleeps]

Don't need to put that in my report.

It's safe with me.

[hotel clerk] That'd be room 304.

Can you tell me who stayed there?

-You're not the police?

-No, but...

Then you'd have to lodge for an information request for that.

But that could take up to a week to process.

Sorry, management's an ass about it ever since that thing with what's-his-name, the judge of Hot Shots?

Anyway, he got caught with a rent boy and, um, a tabloid got his name by hacking our booking system, and yeah, they're tight as anything about the rule now.

Oh, the woman I'm after hasn't done anything.

I just think she might have seen something outside yesterday evening about 6:30.

Oh, I can...

I can tell you that she wasn't outside... and I know what she was looking at.

[gentle scoff] How so?

I can't tell you who she is but, um, she's into interesting films.

We log the in-house movies that people watch and, um... her choice stood out.

Oh. [laughs]

-How nice for her. Thanks. -[laughs]

[seagulls squawking outside]

[computer bleeps]

Oh, bless you.

[man] How's the pizza accident going?

[woman] Hmm. A pain in the ass.

Can't pinpoint liability 'cause no one agrees on the speed of the bloody thing and I can't find anyone who actually saw the impact.

Well, not yet.

[sighs]

Except maybe smudge face here, whoever she is. -[computer bleeps] -[woman] Oh, bingo.

Mia Nolan.

You might be the one, if you'll talk.

What, if she'll talk?

She was doing something embarrassing in the hotel room, watching a porn film.

She might not want me poking around in her head.

[man chuckles]

She's, like, 50 miles out of town.

Do you mind if I head there now?

It's a bit late.

Oh, if I sew this up in 24 hours,

I get two times bonus.

Well...

Go. Go.

Hi, I'm Shazia. I'm from Realm Insurance.

-I've already got insurance, thanks. -[Shazia] I'm not selling anything.

I'm following up on an incident you might've seen, a road accident.

I don't know anything about an accident.

[Shazia] This was only yesterday. -[Mia] An accident?

-On Stanhope Road.

Medina Plaza Hotel, a pedestrian was hit by a delivery vehicle,

Fences Pizza, driverless.

Um... [laughs]

Right, yeah. I'm sorry, actually I did.

When you first mentioned it, I just didn't think of it, but um... yeah, I did.

So you saw what happened?

[Mia] Uh, yeah, there was a guy crossing the street and this little van thing sort of just clipped him, it was quick.

[Shazia] Do you mind if I ask you a few questions about it? It won't take long.

I'm sorry, I'm really busy. I've got...

[Shazia] I don't wanna sound heavy but it's a legal requirement since last year.

It's a legal requirement?

Well, if you've witnessed an incident, yes.

I have to notify the police when people refuse, and when they get involved, it just drags everything out, so...

[Mia clears throat]

-Come in. -[sighs] Thank you.

Yeah, just that way.

[recaller firing up]

[beeping]

[Shazia] OK.

-What does that do? -[Shazia] The recaller?

Just helps me get a record of what happened.

May I?

Well, I can just tell you what happened.

I can remember.

The van hit the guy, and he fell over, and then people came to help.

[Shazia] How fast was it going though, the delivery vehicle?

Um...

[Shazia] See, I just need a sense of that.

It's sometimes hard to articulate what your mind's eye's seen, but capturing your impression of what you saw is really useful.

-OK, but I've got--

-And that's all I'm interested in.

You can read the terms here if you like.

All the legal stuff is in there.

Look, I don't care what you might've been doing in the hotel room in your own time.

I'm not gonna ask you anything about that.

Won't go there.

-OK. -[Shazia] Private stuff is private stuff.

-So it's just the accident?

-Just that.

[Mia] It's a bit of a long read, isn't it?

[Shazia laughs]

-Do you want a tea or a coffee?

-Oh, a coffee would be great.

-Yeah, OK. Espresso?

-Perfect.

[coffee machine whirs]

Do you mind if I just go and have a pee if I'm gonna be sat down a while? -[Shazia] Yeah, sure.

-OK.

I ate hotel food, I had room service.

I ate room service.

I was in the hotel room on my own.

Watched porn.

Watched porn.

Saw the accident.

Come on, focus. [breathes heavily]

I was on my own.

I was on my own.

I was on my own.

OK.

[Shazia] That's it. [chuckles]

-So you've got everything you needed?

-Yeah.

Doesn't take long, it's just a simple thing with the speed so... -[Mia] Right.

-Yeah. Yeah.

[Mia] Sorry about being short, it's been a long day.

-No, it's fine.

-Got a lot of work on. Did you...

-So you've got everything you needed? -[Shazia] Yeah, yeah, got it all.

-Don't worry, thank you so much.

-I know this sounds silly, but, um, you know, sometimes I just think mad things, and it doesn't mean anything, do you know what I mean?

When you have strange thoughts.

No, it's fine, like I said.

I got what I needed, so thank you.

Yeah, but do you know what I mean?

It's not like... it's just my head.

Does your head hurt?

OK.

[whimpers]

[Mia] OK.

What am I gonna do with you?

I mean, I can't let you go.

You're gonna tell someone, aren't you?

[muffled sounds]

I know, but even if you say you won't, your recollections are all recorded. -[muffled] I won't.

-They're not?

[Shazia sobbing] No.

If I take that off your mouth, will you promise not to scream?

-Do you promise? -[whimpers]

Forget the report. I'll delete... [sniffs]

I'll delete it, it won't go anywhere.

I don't know. I tried to delete it, and I couldn't figure it out.

I won't say anything to anyone, I promise.

I'll forget the whole thing.

[crying] No one will know.

I won't say anything.

I wish I believed you.

I mean it. I mean it. I've seen things.

I've seen things on the recaller.

Secrets, personal things,

I've never spilled any of it.

I'm not allowed to, it's the law.

It's like confession, it's like Catholic confession.

It'll be illegal for me to say anything.

Totally illegal, even if I wanted to!

None of that's true, is it?

-It is, I swear. -[Mia] It's not.

It is.

Did you tell anyone that you were coming here today?

No.

-You're lying.

-I'm not. I swear I'm not lying.

[Shazia sobs] No, I swear.

-Coach. -[device] Yes, Frank?

-Where do I go? -[device] Proceed to the hub.

Got ya.

[chattering]

-How will I know who he is? -[device] This is him. -[Frank] Hi. Oh, oh. -[cutlery clatters]

Sorry. Fork.

-Amy.

-No, no, my name's not fork.

-I guessed. It was just--

-It's Frank.

-Do you wanna sit? Shall we sit?

-I think it's that or stand. [laughs]

[Frank] Come sit, yeah?

Oh, oh! That's, um... I was on that side.

-Oh. Shall I...?

-No, no, it doesn't matter.

[Frank laughs] -[Frank] Why bring it up? -[laughs]

Sorry. I'm so bloody nervous.

It's my first time on the, you know, the system.

-Me too.

-Oh, really?

Yeah, I'm shitting it, mate.

-Come to mention it, you look terrified.

-Do I?

-Yeah, quaking with fear.

-Or maybe shaking with revulsion?

At least you stopped... shitting.

Oh! [laughs]

-Are you sure about that? -[both laugh]

[Amy laughs]

-Shall we stop talking about shitting?

-Maybe order some food? Good plan.

Yeah. OK.

-Do you know how we order?

-I think we use these.

-Oh! -[device] Menu choice already established. -[Frank] Oh. Ta. -[waiter] Here you are, sir.

[waiter] And for you, madam.

Well, evidently I'm a pasta girl.

Yeah, I'm a, uh... -[cutlery clatters]

-...fishcake...

[laughs] -[Amy] Hmm. -[Frank] Mmm.

-It's good.

-Can I try some?

Are we... allowed to do that?

Fuck it.

-Yeah, fuck it. -[Amy laughs]

-Mm. That is good.

-Mm-hmm.

So... we're both first-timers.

[Frank] Hmm.

-Shall we check our expiry date?

-Yeah, good plan.

Yeah? All right, um, so I think it's under "info."

Yeah, uh, "tap to reveal."

We have to tap to reveal at the same time.

-OK. So, on three, two, one. Go. -[devices beep]

-Twelve hours.

-Yeah, 12 hours.

-OK.

-Bit, um...

-Yeah.

-Bit short.

-It is a bit short, isn't it?

-Hmm.

Oh. And getting shorter.

I didn't realize it would... sort of count down like that.

It's sort of sad.

Maybe we should eat quickly.

-Yeah. Yeah, maybe we should.

-The race is on.

-Come on, hurry up. -[laughs]

[Frank] I guess this is us.

And this takes us to the place?

Yeah, suppose so.

-After you. -[Amy] Thank you. [laughs]

[whispers] It's massive. -[Frank] Here we are. -[Amy] Yep.

[Amy] Huh.

[vehicle drives away]

-Do you wanna open it or shall I?

-You go ahead.

-All right.

-Ha! Too slow.

You're a knob. [laughs]

[door opens]

Oh, God. It's a shithole.

-You're kidding.

-I am, yeah.

[Amy chuckles]

[lounge music plays]

[Amy] Ooh!

It's nice. I, uh, like that lamp.

-Yeah, it's incredible, that lamp. -[laughs] Fuck off.

[Amy] Hmm.

Right. That's, uh...

[exhales]

There's an en suite.

-Shower or bath?

-Both.

Ah. That's good.

Uh. Well, I'm...

I'm just gonna use the loo.

Yeah, I've got to, uh... over here, so...

[clears throat]

Yeah.

[Amy clears throat]

OK, seriously, what are we meant to do?

[device] Query too broad. Please narrow.

Well, I mean, are we just meant to...

I don't know, like, just go at it? -[device] Define "go at it."

-[scoffs]

Fucking hell.

So, are we meant to just have sex with each other?

[device] Participants are not required to take any specific action.

Yeah, but I mean we can, right?

I mean, people do if it's just a short time?

[device] If that's your decision.

-It's up to us? -[device] It's up to you.

[exhales]

I could just sleep here.

Don't be daft.

You'll be scrunched up in a ball.

[groans]

It's not awful.

The bed's pretty big.

I'm sure we could both fit in it.

Yeah, OK.

Must have been mental before the system.

How do you mean?

Well, people had to do the whole relationship thing themselves, work out who they wanna be with.

Hmm. Option paralysis.

So many choices, you end up not knowing which one you want.

Yeah, exactly, and if things seem shitty, they'd have to figure out whether they wanted to break up with someone.

How to break up with someone.

Fuckin' hell.

-Just a nightmare.

-It's not like when it's all mapped out.

God, no. It's so much simpler when it's all mapped out.

[Frank] Hmm.

-This is weird, though.

-It really is. Hmm.

[door opens and closes]

-Well, then.

-So...

Thanks for being my first. -[devices beep] -[Frank] Oh. Yeah. -[device beeps] -[Amy] Bloody time.

It was great, you know. You were nice. -[devices beeping]

-So were you.

If we had this time again, you would totally get it, by the way.

-Oh, you... You bastard.

-Sorry.

-You'd get it, too.

-Fucked that one up, didn't we?

-Yeah, totally. -[both laugh]

[devices chime]

I guess I just don't see the point in something that short. Twelve hours.

[device]

Even your reaction to a brief encounter provides the system with valuable information.

[pants]

Yeah, well, I didn't even do anything.

The system thinks I'm a prude.

[device] The system makes no moral judgments.

Yeah, but how do I know she wasn't the perfect match for me? She was...

[device] Your ultimate compatible other has not yet been selected.

Yeah, I know, but it's--

[device] The system gains insight as each participant progresses through numerous relationships and uses the gathered data to eventually select an ultimate compatible other.

On your pairing day, I know, and it always finds your perfect match.

[device] In 99.8% of cases.

But I have to go through loads of relationships to find it. -[device] That is correct.

-Great. -[strains] -[stone skips four times] -[device chimes]

-What was that? -[device] Another relationship.

-What, already? -[device chimes] -[Frank] What's this, another one?

[device] That is correct.

[sighs] I'd best go get changed, then. -[chattering] -[music plays softly]

Holy fuck. Tell me that's him.

[device] I cannot confirm identity until a personal introduction is made.

-Hi.

-Hi. -[device] Identity confirmed. -[man clears throat]

-I like your hair.

-Yours is good too.

-It's all my own. -[Amy laughs]

It's just funny.

[Amy laughs]

[Frank] Hi.

I'm Frank.

[woman] Hmm.

Nicola. I've been here a while.

Aye, sorry. I was getting changed.

-Really?

-You started already?

-I was hungry.

-Yeah, course, yeah. Sorry.

Come on, let's get it over with.

Checking the expiry.

Oh! Yeah, yeah.

[devices beep]

One year.

We've got each other for one year?

Could be a mistake.

-Coach, is this a mistake? -[device] This is not a mistake.

Jesus fucking Christ.

There'll be a reason.

[Frank] Thanks.

[clears throat]

[cutlery scrapes on plate]

Look on the bright side.

Chicken tikka masala.

What?

Chicken tikka mas-- It's a joke.

Right. So you're the sort of person that makes jokes.

[puts cutlery down]

-OK, so on three.

-Two, one.

[devices beep]

Oh. Interesting.

Nine months.

Well... cheers.

Cheers.

[exhales loudly] -[electronic sounds] -[door opens]

[soft jazz playing]

Pretty much the same as my last one.

-How many of these have you had?

-Relationships? So far? Five. -[Amy] Oh. [laughs]

-I'm an old hand, I suppose.

[Amy clears throat]

Listen, I'm just gonna jump in the shower.

-OK.

-Won't be long.

[Amy laughs]

[soft jazz continues]

[man] Hey.

Hi.

[man] So, listen, if you're OK with it, this is relationship five for me, and I've found it's best to have sex straight away upfront.

Right, yeah.

Kind of breaks the ice, gives an early overview of compatibility and so on.

Yep. [laughs nervously]

-So I'm consenting to everything now. -[device beeps]

Whenever you feel comfortable doing the same-- -[device chimes] -[man clears throat]

[panting]

[moaning]

[grunting]

Tikka masala. Just... -[Frank] What?

-It's a bit tikka masala. -[Frank] Oh. I'm sorry. -[Nicola] Talking makes it worse.

[muffled] Sorry.

No, no, you're gonna have to do it from behind. -[Frank] You what?

-From behind.

[moaning]

Bit faster?

More motion.

Not like that. More motion.

You're all in out, in out, like you're trying to shut a drawer into a filing cabinet. -[Frank] Sorry.

-It's just boring.

Want a bit more side to side.

Like this?

No, not really.

[exhales loudly]

[mimics loud exhaling] -[chuckles]

-What was that?

-Nothing.

-Hmm.

[exhales loudly]

[sighs]

[Nicola snores quietly]

[chimes]

[exhales]

Fucking hell.

[Frank] So I can't just walk away?

[device] That is correct.

One day it will provide you with the ultimate match.

One day. One day.

[chattering]

[woman] So I'd just like to say, do have faith in the system, because it does deliver.

-It did for us. -[both laugh]

[woman] You have so many experiences, and then one day it pairs you up with your ultimate match, the best in show, as it were. -[imitates dog barking] -[laughs]

Ha.

So if you're having doubts, just hang on in there.

-Because it really does work. -[laughs]

[light cheering]

[romantic harp music]

Garlic dip. Thanks for that. -[Amy] Hi. Hi.

-Mm! -[mumbles]

-Was that, uh, your...?

-Yeah. Nicola.

-Oh. Nicola. -[Frank] Hmm.

-Ha. -[coughing] -[Amy] You OK?

No, you're not being...?

Are you being serious?

Oh, my God.

OK, this is happening. OK, um, just...

[spits]

[Frank] Oh. Thanks. [laughs]

[pants]

-You look well.

-Thanks.

I'd return the compliment, but you've just spat food on my shoe, so...

To be fair, it is a revolting shoe, so...

All the better to kick you with.

[gasps]

[laughs] Was that really hard?

-Ouch.

-I'm so sorry. [laughs] Fuck.

[both laugh] -[Amy] Shit. -[Frank clears throat]

Oh. Oh! Um... Uh...

Lenny, this is, um, Frank.

Frank, this is Lenny.

-Hi, Lenny. You all right?

-Hi.

We were together for a bit. [laughs]

-A small... small bit.

-Yeah, just before we...

So you two...? Oh. That's... that's great.

So, I mean... it looks like you two make a great team.

[Lenny exhales loudly]

Yeah. [laughs uncomfortably]

[applause and cheering] -[Frank] Yeah.

-Um, I'll see you.

Yeah.

[Amy breathes heavily]

[Lenny exhales loudly]

[Amy sighs]

[Lenny exhales loudly]

-You know that noise you make?

-What noise?

[mimics Lenny exhaling]

-Do I do that?

-Yeah, you do, quite often.

Does it bother you?

A bit, yeah.

-I'll try not to.

-OK.

[device chimes]

[Lenny exhales loudly]

[device chimes]

[device chimes]

[device chimes]

[device beeps]

So it's been great, really.

-Shame it has to end.

-But end it must.

Anyway...

[device beeps continuously]

-OK, bye. -[beeping stops, device chimes]

[device alert sound]

Another partner already?

[device] That is correct.

So, three, two, one, go.

[devices chime]

Thirty-six hours?

[panting]

Well, uh... bye.

-Bye.

-Bye.

[Amy] Three, two, one.

[devices chime]

[inaudible dialogue]

[devices chime]

[device alert sound]

[device beeps continuously]

[exhales]

[device chimes]

-I just wanna say--

-Don't.

Well, I learned what it's like to cohabit with someone I despise.

-Is that useful for the system? -[device] Everything happens for a reason.

[scoffs]

[device alert sound]

That's sooner than I expected.

[sighs] -[music plays softly] -[chattering] -[laughs] Hello, you.

-Hi.

[Amy] Hi.

[Frank] Is this right? -[Amy] Yeah. -[Frank] I mean...

Yeah, I didn't think the system would hook us up again.

No, me neither. I mean,

I hope it's right, obviously, but...

-Coach, are we sat at the right table? -[device] Yes, that is correct.

[laughs] OK, well...

Wait, um...

Can we not check the expiry date?

-Uh... Why?

-Just sick of it.

The system's just bounced me from bloke to bloke, short fling after short fling.

I know they're short flings, they're just meaningless, and I get really detached.

It's like I'm not really there.

So the other week, I was with this guy,

God knows who, basically just a haircut.

And I literally had this out-of-body experience.

I wandered out of my body, and I sat in this chair across the room and I watched myself fucking this guy.

And I was, like, what is that all about?

That is literally just a dick going in and out of a hole.

-Yeah, that's pretty detached. -[Amy laughs]

When it's a long-term thing, it's just as bad, watching the clock like you're a prisoner, counting the hours, the minutes.

-Oh, God, I've been there.

-Yeah.

-Yeah, let's not check the expiry, then.

-Yeah.

-It's a deal.

-Deal. -[Amy] OK. -[Frank] Bring on les fishcake. -[laughs] -[Frank] I don't know.

[device chimes]

-So?

-So...

-Might as well.

-I suppose we have to.

-Don't know how much time we've got.

-Yeah, it could be ten minutes.

-Think you could last ten minutes?

-Fuck off.

[laughter]

All right. OK, then.

Wait. One of us should get undressed first.

-Why only one of us?

-It'll be funny.

-Go on then. Get your kit off. -[laughs]

No. No, it was my idea.

[Frank laughs]

All right.

[belt buckle rattles]

This is kind of emasculating.

Well, then, you'd better make up for it in a minute.

-♪ I'm gonna see your dick ♪ -[laughs]

[laughs] Sorry.

-♪ I'm gonna fucking see it ♪

-Yeah, OK. Yeah--

What if there is no scrutiny, it's just putting us together in any old order, and we all go along with it 'cause they're always telling us how clever it is?

Yeah, but it does put people with the one.

It's got a 99.8% success rate.

But how do you know they're perfect matches?

I mean, what if all it's actually doing is gradually wearing us down, putting us in one relationship after another for random durations in a random sequence?

Each time you get a little bit more pliable, a little bit more broken, until eventually it coughs up the final offering and says that's the one.

And by that point you are so defeated and so exhausted that you just accept it, you settle.

And then you have to live the rest of your life convincing yourself you didn't.

Well done. That's one of the bleakest things I've ever heard.

[Amy laughs] Thank you.

Right. Do you wanna know my theory?

Let's assume the system isn't random.

-It's as sophisticated as they say it is.

-OK.

Right, so using these, it slurps up all your reactions, yeah?

-It builds up a complex profile.

-Mm-hmm.

Every crazy thought you've ever had, all your dreams and your weaknesses and--

-And your mad theories.

-Yeah, like, everything in your head.

-Right.

-So if it's everything in your head...

-does it have thoughts?

-All right, so now you're gonna say:

[mimics his accent] "What if that's us and we're stuck in a simulation?"

Well, how would we know? -[Frank yelps] -[Amy laughs]

I think that settles it.

I might have been programmed to go "Ow."

OK. [chuckles]

[Frank chuckles]

[giggles]

-Hey, come here. -[Amy chuckles] No.

[Amy yelps and laughs]

-Coach? -[device] Hello, Frank.

-I've gotta know. -[device] What would you like to know?

The expiry date for me and Amy.

I need to know how long.

You're not gonna talk me out of it?

[device] Would you like me to talk you out of it?

Yeah. Uh... No. I...

Don't know.

[beeps]

No, I'm not gonna do it.

I said I wouldn't.

We shook on it.

-Fuck it. -[device chimes]

[beeping] -[device] Recalibrating.

-[beeping]

[device chimes]

[alert beeping]

Coach?

-Coach.

-Recalibrating. [beeping]

What's happening?

Coach, it's getting shorter.

[door opens]

[device] One-sided observation has destabilized the expiry date.

[device chimes]

-What? -[device] One-sided observation has destabilized the expiry date.

Recalibrating. [beeping]

'Cause I looked at it on my own, it made it shorter? -[device] That is correct.

-Why?

[device] Everything happens for a reason.

[chimes]

All right, well, undo it, then.

Make it go back.

[device] I cannot do that. Recalibrating.

What if she looks at it?

[device] Once shortened, the expiry date cannot be extended. -[device chimes]

-Why?

[device] Everything happens for a reason.

-Come on. Come on. -[device] Recalibrating.

[beeping]

-When will it stop? -[device] It will stabilize once recalibration has completed.

Recalibrating.

Stop it. Stop it. Just...

[device chimes]

[exhales]

[sniffles]

[Amy giggles]

You OK?

Yeah, I'm fine.

-All right. -[Frank] I'm good.

Have you ever had more than four or less than four?

[Amy] What you thinking about?

Nothing.

[Amy exhales]

All right, seriously, what's up?

[inhales deeply] -[Frank] I looked.

-Looked at what?

We promised we wouldn't. We shook on it.

-Don't you wanna know what it said?

-No. That was the point.

-It's almost done anyway.

-How almost done?

We've got, like, an hour. -[sighs]

-Why didn't you tell me this before?

-Didn't wanna spoil today.

-And this hasn't spoilt it?

It was supposed to be five years, but now...

[exhales loudly]

I looked at it, something happened, it started going down.

-I don't know what it was.

-So you broke it?

No, no, no, no, no.

I mean, I don't... I don't know.

Why did you have to look at it?

Look, I was thinking maybe we could overcome it somehow.

Why did you have to look at it?

-Because I like you. -[sighs]

Like properly, really, I like you.

-For fuck's sake. And that wasn't enough?

-That's not the point.

-I looked, but that's not the issue here.

-Are you sure about that?

You're more wound up about that than how short the time is.

Yes, because we had agreed.

-Listen. Listen. Listen. -[Amy exhales]

-What if we just ignore it?

-We can't.

Listen, we'll just fuck the system.

We'll fuck it--

-And do what?

-We'll jump out, over the wall, get out.

-There is nothing out there.

-How d'you know? How d'you know?

-Amy...

-You've ruined this.

You've ruined it.

-Hey, it's nothing. -[taser crackles]

-Amy.

-Don't follow me.

[Frank] Amy, I'm sorry.

[Frank] Amy. -[device] Everything happens for a reason. -[crying] What reason?

[device] The system will be assessing your reaction to the painful premature termination of a treasured relationship and will adjust and improve its profile of your eventual chosen one accordingly. -[sniffs] You're a great comfort. -[device] Thank you.

[cries]

I swear to God,

I feel like scaling the wall out there and jumping in the fucking wilderness.

[device] That would contravene the rules of the system.

Oh, the fucking system. [sniffs]

[device] Failure to comply with the system may result in banishment.

[shouts] All right, I know.

Christ, will you let me be angry at least?

Will you give me that?

[sniffs]

[device] You must vacate your current living quarters when the time expires.

Like I didn't know.

[sighs]

[sniffs]

And if I hadn't have looked, we'd have been together years.

She was...

You know when you meet someone and you just know? You just know that...

Reckon you could pop this in me now?

I've sort of got jaw ache.

Yeah, come on.

And after all that, he never even apologized, not once.

That's too bad.

Do you mind if I think about her?

If I can think about him?

Yeah, sound.

[panting]

[headboard bangs on wall]

One, two, three, four.

One, two, three, four.

[exhales]

[device chimes]

[device] Congratulations, Amy.

Your ultimate match has been identified.

Your pairing day is tomorrow.

-Ultimate as in "the one"? -[device] That is correct.

-And we meet tomorrow? -[device] That is correct.

Tomorrow you'll be coupled with your ultimate match and together you will leave this place forever.

OK. [exhales]

Are you allowed to tell me anything about them?

-Do I know them already? -[device] Negative.

-Right. -[device] There is one more thing.

Yeah, and what's that?

[device] Prior to pairing day, you have been allocated a short farewell period with an individual of your choosing.

A farewell period?

Like, I get to say goodbye to someone?

[device] That is correct.

Data shows this can help provide psychological closure.

Frank, I choose Frank.

[device] Your choice has been registered.

Wait. Where are we meeting?

[device] Usual booth, 7:30 p.m.

Right.

-Coach? -[device] Yes, Amy?

Count to four.

[device] One, two, three, four.

[Frank] Wait, wait. How long have we got?

[beeping] -[slams table] -[beeping continues]

Look, the system's set my pairing day for tomorrow.

-Yeah, me too.

-Right.

I don't want whoever the system reckons the one is, OK?

-I want you.

-I want you.

[device] Failure to comply with the system

-may result in banishment.

-You can fuck off.

Can you remember where you were before you came here?

[device beeping]

You can't, can you?

-No.

-Me neither.

-Why can't I think of that?

-It's a test.

Do you remember the first night that we were together? How did you feel?

I felt safe, happy, comfortable.

It felt right. It felt like something locked into place, like we'd met before.

Like it had happened before and it'll happen again, like it's happened a thousand times over and over again.

-Do you know what I mean?

-Yeah. Yeah, I do.

Ever since we've met, this world has been toying with us.

It's trying to keep us apart. It's...

It's a test, I swear it is, and the two of us rebelling together is something to do with passing it.

-We've gotta fuck it all off. -[laughs]

Exactly. We've just gotta fuck the whole thing off and go.

-Yeah, over the wall.

-Right over it.

-No matter what's out there.

-OK.

[device beeping]

So let's go.

Yeah, let's go.

[beeping continues]

[device chimes and falls silent]

[taser crackles]

[crackling stops]

[panting]

[Amy] Come on.

- Whats so bad about being a pig?

Its undignified.

Undignified?

Walking about with your nose the same height as your asshole.

- Snout.

- Whats that?

Pigs have snouts, not noses.

So it would be your snout the same height as your asshole.

Nose, snout.

Youre still trotting about gazing up everybody elses assholes all day long.

What kind of society is that?

An equal one?

Hello?

Oh.

Pick up. Please, fucking pick up.

Oh, fuck.

Hello? Who is that?

I cant hear you. Youre not clear.

Listen, if you can hear me, just whistle. Dont say anything.

OK, OK.

I cant talk for long.

We found a dog at the warehouse.

We didnt see it. We dont know how long it had been in there.

It got Tony and Clarke.

So theyre gone. Im... Im sorry.

And can you tell Ali that Im sorry too?

She said that we were mad to bother and she was right.

We... We just wanted to help her with Jack.

I dont know...

Get him something that might help.

I know hes in pain.

Ive lost the dog for now, but my guess is its still operational.

And Im figuring it can lock onto this signal, so Im gonna have to go dark.

Its, um... It stuck me with a tracker, but I managed to get it out.

Im gonna have to find somewhere overnight to hide out, I...

Get some medical stuff or something.

If I dont make it back... will you pass a message to Graham?

Just I love him.

Please would you pass that on?

Im gonna have to switch off now.

Ill try and make it back.

Bye, now.

Oh, fuck.

Fuck!

Ah!

Come on.

Argh!

Stay still.

Shit, shit, shit.

You cant do it.

You cant do it.

Your arms fucked, so you cant climb the tree.

Yeah, take a good look, mate.

Youll be waiting a long time.

A very long time.

Oh.

Fuck.

Fuck.

Ah.

Is there anyone there?

Maybe you can hear me?

Maybe someone can hear me.

If there is anyone there...

This is just to say that Im not coming back.

Say Im sorry to Ali and that she should give Jack a kiss from me.

Im sorry I didnt get the replacement like I promised.

I know how dear it was to him.

And I did try.

We all tried.

I hope you can look after him.

And, Graham, I love you.

And all of you.

Ive always loved you all.

Mm-hm.

DOOR UNLOCKS

Hi.

- Hey.

Tours begin at 11:00.

You're the first in line.

Could be a busy day.

NISH:

Road seemed pretty empty.

Nice accent.

You from Australia?

- No, I'm from Britain.

So you've got one of those crazy British names?

Esmerelda or...

I'm Nish.

Nish?

- Nish.

Well, I can't judge.

My name's ridiculous.

Rolo Haynes. Owner. Proprietor.

Well, just us two this morning.

You sure you want to do this?

This place ain't for the faint-hearted.

I'm sure I can handle it.

Not everyone can.

ROLO LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

ROLO:

So...

I have to peek into your little sack there, if that's OK?

Oh, that's OK.

ROLO:

Can't trust anyone these days.

If you could step through there?

Anything metal, put it in here.

- Cool.

Dinky.

Ah, yeah. I call it fun size.

Fun size? I like that.

Guessing you had a gut full of this security shit at the airport?

Our immigration guys are pretty tight these days.

KEYS JINGLE

All clear?

MACHINE BEEPS

OK.

Show on the road.

So, are you on vacation?

Sort of. My dad lives out here.

- Uh-huh?

It's his birthday, so my mum just wants to surprise him.

And you're the surprise?

Part of it, I guess.

Where did you fly in?

- Salt Lake.

You came here from Salt Lake?

Yeah, I thought it'd be nice to drive the back route, but...

I underestimated the...

- Heck of a trip for a girl on her own.

I don't mean to get old-fashioned on you.

- Seriously?

That is quite old-fashioned.

It's hot as hell in here.

SWITCHES FLICK

The AC must've shit the bed.

Sorry for the heat.

NISH WHISTLES

God damn digital systems.

Never trust a guy in tech.

Jesus, I should know that.

So, what is all this stuff?

ROLO:

Authentic criminological artefacts.

If it did something bad, chances are it's in here.

Take a look around, take your time, see what pops out at you.

Anything piques your interest,

I can tell you all about it.

There's a sad, sick story behind most everything here.

Just like our main attraction, which is just through there.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Lots of folks just rush behind the curtain hardly even eyeball this stuff and then it's a bunch of one-star ratings on Trip fucker.

And before you know it...

- Yo, look, I am not in a rush so don't worry.

Well, then, take your time.

I shall.

This stuff looks techy.

- Well, neuro tech was my background.

Sweet.

So, what's this, then?

Looks like a hairdressing thing.

Actually, that was one of my very first souvenirs.

Sheds a little light on how our main exhibit came to be.

What is it?

- You heard of Peter Dawson?

Uh-uh.

Doctor Peter Dawson?

Well, usually I say

"This is Dawson's symphatic diagnoser" and folks shriek, "No way", and I'm like, "Oh, it very much is."

"How the heck did you get that?" is the next question.

OK.

My domain was med tech.

I worked out of San Juniper's.

It's kind of like a university hospital.

Sweet setup.

Part of the Land Act, actually.

TRAFFIC DRONES

- It was in downtown New York big old building.

Research up top

Emergency Room and the great unwashed down at street level.

It was the perfect mix of business and healthcare.

CAR HORN

Seriously?

TAXI DRIVER:

Out of the way, arsehole!

Idea was, folks with no coverage signed up for free healthcare in exchange for consenting to occasional experimental treatments.

I... I... I worked for the guys up top.

What, like a scientist?

I was more, sort of... recruitment.

OK, clear.

- NURSE: Yeah, I'm here.

Shocking.

DEFIBRILLATOR SHOCKS

No.

- No?

No.

- OK, I'm going again. Clear.

Clear!

- NURSE: Got it.

Shocking!

- DEFIBRILLATOR SHOCKS

No.

If I'd known she was on tricyclics

I would've nudged the dose.

You couldn't have known.

BIN LID SLAMS SHUT

HE CLEARS THROAT

This a bad time?

Rolo Haynes from the tenth floor.

Seems you've been having some problems.

I think I've got something that can help.

ROLO:

The big thing they're into is neuro technics.

Pioneering brain enhancements.

Neural interfaces.

All that fun stuff.

The holy grail they've been aiming for is a way to transfer knowledge.

So one of the teams here is working on an experiment trying to find a way to beam information from one brain to another.

HE CLEARS THROAT

This is Kenny.

This is Hector.

Stay with me on this.

So, the experiment.

They built a little maze and they drop Kenny here into it.

He runs round over and over for months on end till he knows it like a childhood home.

And then... they put this on him.

It's a transmitter absorbing signals from Kenny's brain which were sent to Hector over here.

Hector had our prototype synaptic receiver fitted.

Now, remember, Hector had never even set paw in the maze.

Plan was, he'd now receive

Kenny's knowledge of the maze layout and, boom, he'd be able to solve it, first time.

Did he?

- No.

Scrabbled around like a rat, fucking imbecile.

So, um, why are you telling me this?

Because just as it becomes clear that the maze thing's a bust one of our researchers spills his coffee on Kenny.

Hot coffee spills all over Kenny, so obviously he's squealing like hell but so is Hector.

Turns out, we haven't discovered how to share knowledge...

But physical sensations.

- Bingo.

That's nuts. Holy shit.

And even nutsier shit

Hector felt the burn, but took no damage at all.

All of the experience, none of the physical cost.

But how did he die?

They cut him open after to see if he was OK.

Oh.

Anyhow, thanks to Hector's sacrifice, we prototyped this.

A receiver for human experiences.

A neural implant. Only one of its kind.

This is why you brought me up here.

What's the biggest pain in the arse with patients?

Finding out what's wrong with them in the first place.

Half of the arseholes that roll in here can't even describe their symptoms.

They're... They're either out cold or concussed or drunk or dumb or 2 years old or they can't speak English.

Imagine if you could feel exactly what a patient feels minus the physical consequences?

Like reading their minds.

So, what do you say?

Got to hand it to Dawson, he leapt at the chance.

Like he was happy to do it.

And it was only a short procedure.

Irreversible, but, hey, he was a pioneer.

Plus, his mortality rates were in the toilet so this was his best shot at redemption.

Does it hurt if I touch it?

- I don't think so.

DAWSON CHUCKLES

There's something kind of kinky about it.

It's like the ultimate piercing.

If you're trying to make me feel better, it's working.

Time for the trial run.

So this is where our hairnet doohickey comes into play.

Theory was, if you slipped it on a willing subject it'd absorb their physical sensations and relay them to Dawson's implant.

We just had to find out if it worked.

DAWSON GASPS

Ow.

This one.

Houston, we got a miracle.

Right off the bat

Dawson gets to work with the ailing public

Starts building up a kind of library of physical symptoms.

Plan was, he'd get to know how things felt so that he could diagnose them quicker.

So, start small in the ER, minor fractures, that sort of thing.

Soon graduates to bigger stuff.

Major injuries. Diseases.

Late-stage terminal stuff.

Dawson grit his teeth and went through it all.

Say a kid comes in obviously in pain.

Doctors suspect appendicitis, they'd hook him up to Dawson just to be sure

Dawson had felt appendicitis many times by now so he knows if it's something more.

Caught things they weren't even looking for.

Blastomas and so on.

- Good luck, man!

ROLO:

That man saved lives.

No doubt about it.

Good luck, huh?

- WOMAN: Bye.

Stay in touch. Bye bye.

Bye.

DAWSON SIGHS

- That was nice.

ROLO:

And, incidentally, if you'll allow me to be crude...

Dawson's symphatic diagnoser came in handy in the bedroom.

His implant received pleasurable sensations, too.

BOTH PANTING

So, if his girlfriend slipped on that transmitting blue hairnet and he tuned in his little implant nubbin...

Oh my God, you feel...

He didn't just feel what he was feeling..

I'm going to come!

- but also felt what she was feeling.

Son of a bitch was experiencing male and female orgasms at the same time.

Oh, my... Oh, my...

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

BOTH PANTING, GASPING

Shit!

I can't get enough of your...

But?

I'm sorry?

Dawson's having a great time, there's got to be a "but".

Oh.

He's having a great time, but...

But...

PARAMEDIC SHOUTS:

Coming through. Coming through.

Come on!

- Almost there.

ROLO:

One day, they rush in Senator Whitley he'd collapsed at some fundraiser.

No one could tell what in hell was wrong with him.

- NURSE: Three, two, one, lift.

I've got this.

ROLO:

Dawson's hooked up.

MADGE:

Be careful.

OK. Oh! Oh! Jesus!

And has the roughest ride.

Oh!

- Pete?

ROLO:

Like he's got no clue what this is.

Pete!

- Just one more minute, please!

Let the man work.

- Oh!

ROLO:

It's a pain he's never known.

Oh! Oh! Shit!

He's flatlining.

- Just one more moment!

Then it happened.

FLAT-LINE BEEP

VOICE ECHOING:

Pete?

FLAT-LINE BEEP CONTINUES

Dawson blacked out for like five minutes.

Turns out the senator had been poisoned.

A rare poison at that, some kind of Russian shit.

He'd been into that whole thing.

But Dawson had experienced death and come out the other side.

HE GASPS

At the moment of death a whole galaxy of synapses fritzes out of existence.

Tsunami of endorphins.

And then there's this rolling dark wave of nothing rushes in behind.

When he came round, they ran every kind of test but he was all systems go, nothing wrong.

"Shaken but unharmed" they put on his report.

Next day, he was back up and at 'em.

But there was something wrong, right?

To go through all that without dying?

Fucked up his implant like that.

SNAPS FINGERS

CLEARS THROAT

HE EXHALES

Oh, my God.

MADGE EXHALES

I'm just going to get some water.

- OK.

MADGE:

Ah!

Oh, goddammit.

DAWSON PANTS

ROLO:

Fair to say his relationship with pain had shifted a little.

Uh, that hurt like hell.

ROLO:

Now he was into it.

He really threw himself into his work after that.

He tried to hide it at first but thanks to that little nubbin the more pain he felt, the more pleasure he got.

HE SLAPS HER

- THEY GROAN

DAWSON GRUNTS

MADGE:

OK, no, stop, stop.

OK, safe word! Stop!

HEAVY BREATHING

You said that we could try it.

- And we did.

Look, we tried the hair pulling and that choke thing.

I'm not into it, OK? It's just not me.

DAWSON SIGHS

HE BREATHES HEAVILY

Maybe I should go.

No.

No, please. I'm sorry.

Stay.

Please?

HE MOANS

Ow. Pete!

I'm going.

ROLO:

See, it's like eating chillies.

You acclimatise fast.

First time you had a jalapeno, bet you spat it out, too hot.

But persevere and it becomes addictive.

Soon, a jalapeno's not enough.

You work your way up, red-hot chillies, bird's-eye chillies till you get to them Scotch bonnet devils.

Dawson's craving was just the same.

Before you know it, he's hanging around the ER just waiting for a juicy accident victim to latch onto.

All he can think about is that next hit gnawing away up there.

"Give it back to me. Give it back.

Got to have it back."

Sarah, will you just file these for me?

SARAH: Sure thing.

- Pete?

This isn't your shift.

I just...

Pete?

PARAMEDIC:

Careful.

And three, two, one, lift.

NURSE:

Let me get this.

ROLO:

As soon as he jacks in, he feels it.

It's a cardiac arrest.

She collapsed in the street.

DAWSON:

I just want to be sure.

It's a heart attack, alright, but he says nothing.

Plays for time.

EXHALES DEEPLY

Figures he can ride that pain train all the way through to Nirvana.

Eventually, they have to physically pull Dawson away from her.

HE GASPS

- FLAT-LINE TONE

HE GRUNTS

ROLO:

Give Aunt Ethel her CPR.

She flatlines in front of him and he's like an alcoholic watching someone pour a glass of good Scotch down the sink sick at the waste of good shit.

Look, we always knew going into this there might be side effects.

I mean, we can look into how we deactivate but it's going to take some time.

I can't just pull all the people off the other projects, Pete.

I mean, we have milestones to hit.

You know the drill.

But we'll get there.

In the meantime, we can't have you near patients so just go home, put your feet up and binge a mini-series, whatever.

No one could've known what would happen next.

REPORTER:

Authorities are expected to confirm the body is that of missing

WNL weather reporter Denise Stockley.

Certainly a major police presence there, as we can see.

Let's take a look at the timeline...

ROLO:

Dawson was home alone, 24-7 climbing the walls.

Withdrawal, I guess.

REPORTER:

She was last seen the evening of Friday, September 15th...

ROLO:

He didn't have patients to leech pain off any more.

So he started inflicting it... on himself

HE YELPS

HE EXHALES

REPORTER:

...for her safe return or for any information from witnesses.

ROLO:

Spent a week just whittling away at himself.

Cut here, a gouge there.

I mean, the guy was a doctor.

He knew how far he could go without it getting fatal.

DAWSON GRUNTS

HE GRUNTS

PLIERS CLATTER

But it was never enough.

None of it was enough.

When he worked on himself, there was a crucial ingredient missing.

Fear.

SNAPS FINGERS

The amygdala.

Little almond-shaped nubbin in your brain.

When you're afraid, it lights up like a midnight airstrike sharpens the senses.

The fear the patient feels when they're staring up at that ceiling light.

The fear accompanying each sudden jab of agony he'd come to appreciate that, too.

It went with the pain.

Complimented it, like red wine and steak.

You can inflict pain on yourself but not terror.

For that, you need a volunteer.

TRAFFIC DRONES

FIRE CRACKLES

TASER FIRES UP

ELDERLY MAN GROANS

DRILL FIRES UP

ELDERLY MAN SCREAMS

SCREAMING CONTINUES

POLICE SIREN

DRILLING AND SCREAMING

PANTS AND GROANS

Dawson was practically coming when they found him.

He'd enjoyed one big old speed ball of fear and pain and death.

Tell me they put him in jail.

In the hospital.

He wound up in a vegetative state.

Good.

Still there, to this day.

In a coma deep as the ocean.

But the thing of it is they say he still has that look on his face.

Blissed out, still riding that high.

You're fucking with me, right?

OK, I added the boner,

I couldn't resist.

Fun story, huh?

Yes, fun story.

Wooh.

EXHALES DEEPLY

EXHALES DEEPLY

Oh, man. Do you want some water?

Really, I'm fine.

- No, man. It's no bother.

Thank you kindly.

So, how come you didn't stay in med tech?

Well, I did for a while.

Just cos Dawson went la-la, neuro research didn't stop.

HE SIGHS

TCKR adapted it and fine-tuned it.

It's how they wound up with a digital consciousness transference.

What they call "cookies" today.

Uh, like when they upload old people to the Cloud?

Yeah, this is way before that.

We didn't have that whole immersive VR environment shizzle back then

What we dealt with was more organic, almost Io-fi.

How so?

Got to say, you ask more questions than the average bear.

Well, to be honest, my car's still charging so I've got a bit of time.

SCREEN BEEPS

ROLO:

Well, then...

What I wanted to show you, um...

Part of what I was working on...

It's... um, cute?

Actually one of the saddest things in the whole place.

Doesn't look it.

You ever had one of those relationships where you just can't get someone out of your head?

Yeah.

Some years back boy meets girl, boy's called Jack girl's called...

- Jill.

Carrie...

MUSIC: "Spread Your Love" by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club

JACK:

Cupcake?

Thank you.

You're welcome.

♪ Spread your love like a fever ♪

♪ And don't you ever come down ♪

Are you the sheriff now?

- Yeah.

And I'm the prisoner?

- You're in trouble, sir.

Come and arrest me.

♪ I ain't ever coming down ♪

Eventually, he dick pukes a little baby pace up her wazoo, which takes hold.

HEARTBEAT PULSATES

Before you know it, out pops a boy.

Parker. Boom. They're a family unit.

A walking commercial for a sunnier future.

Happy as hell.

I want to take a photo.

Now, OK... I'm going to get the lake in the background.

Alright, buddy.

- OK, you ready?

Parker.

Wave to Mummy. Say hello.

Say hi to Mummy.

TYRES SQUEAL

Carrie gets hit by a truck.

Winds up at San Juniper's.

PARKER MURMURS

JACK WHISPERS:

Come back to me.

Come back...

ROLO:

Years go by

Jack visits her every week.

Talks to her. Plays her recordings of their son.

Shoots the shit.

She never wakes up.

But they tested the comm box on her.

Kind of basic device that let's coma folks sort of respond back.

I got you some room fresheners.

You want Pine Forest?

OK.

What about Citrus Fresh?

Got you.

And I recorded Parker singing with some other kids.

Do you want to hear it?

KIDS SING:

♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪

♪ How I wonder what you are ♪

Hey.

- Hey.

The woman in 302, Carrie Lamasse you're the partner, right?

Uh-huh.

- Jack?

Rolo Haynes.

I represent Neuro R&D for TCKR.

OK.

We're working on a project that might be of interest to someone in your position.

What's my position?

We're exploring something that could give the likes of Carrie a whole new lease of life.

I'm talking miraculous.

What do you mean?

So the guys at TCKR have been working on digitally extracting a consciousness out of one brain and kind of rehousing it in a host brain.

What does that even mean?

OK, so, even on a good day we only use 40% of our brain capacity.

There's this whole other 60% of our noggin hanging around like an empty Airbnb.

And so...?

- And so, with our new compression technique. we figure we can fit another whole consciousness into that unused space.

I'm talking about taking Carrie's consciousness from that broken shell and putting it in there.

What? You're talking like a voice inside my head?

Like the whole of her inside your head.

Like a hitchhiker. Like a passenger.

Vicarious sensations.

She sees what you see.

She feels what you feel.

She can live again.

Feels, as in...?

You've got a little boy. Parker.

How do you know all this?

- You hug Parker and Carrie feels it, too.

She can hug your son via you.

How much does this all cost?

Won't cost a thing.

We will have to euthanise her physical body during the transfer process, but...

We would earmark her organs for transplants

Giving back to the community.

So, what do you say?

I'd have to think about it.

Carrie's done her thinking.

How about you?

SCIENTIST:

Commencing upload procedure.

MACHINE BUZZES

JACK GRUNTS

ROLO:

OK, she's installed.

She's home.

SNAPS FINGERS

ROLO:

You can open your eyes now, Jack.

GASPS

Carrie?

If you can hear me tell Jack what you see.

An apple. I see an apple.

I can hear her.

Apple. Apple. She's saying apple.

Hey, baby.

Hey, Jack.

Take it.

Grip it.

Carrie, you feel that?

She... She says she feels it.

Sensations looking good. Take a bite.

Oh, God.

So long since I tasted anything.

You can taste that?

She tastes it. Holy shit.

Looks like you're all set.

Shall we bring him in?

SHE GASPS

Is that Parker?

He got so big!

Oh, God, Jack, hold him.

Hold our little boy.

Give me a really big hug, please?

Ah. I feel him. I really feel him.

JACK:

Mummy says she loves you.

Truly heart-warming.

Yeah. But this is where you say "but".

Well, not to wax philosophical, but... how long can happiness realistically last anyhow?

God, turn the page already.

Man, you read slow.

I like to take in the pictures.

That's what the graphic part of a graphic novel is.

It's true.

Hey, I've got to take a piss.

Oh, urgh. I'll never get used to this.

Feels good, huh?

TOILET FLUSHES

Whoa, you're not washing our hands?

Our hands?

Seriously, though. It's kind of gross.

HE SIGHS

REPORTER:

Thirty-eight-year-old Clayton Lee was today found guilty of the horrific murder of WNL weather reporter Denise Stockley whose mutilated remains were discovered one year ago...

We should turn this off.

It's disturbing to a 4-year-old.

He's fine. He's not even listening.

GLASS SMASHES

Parker! Jesus.

Don't snap at him.

Oh, but snapping at me is fine?

Baby, you're...

- How does that work?

He's a child.

This is serious, man.

No. No, I'm not... I'm not being...

I'm not being unreasonable.

He not yet...

No, just wait, no...

Just hear me out.

Having a back seat driver glued into the back seat ain't no fun for anyone in the car.

No privacy for him. No agency for her.

It'd drive you mental.

- Exactly.

You know? Fine. Forget it.

Alright. Go ahead. Keep talking.

I'm going for the anchovies.

Going to be quiet?

Hmm? Want to shut up now?

We're good?

Hmm?

You...

Fuck you!

Urgh! Fuck.

Yeah. I don't care.

Oh, you still talking?

Hmm? You...

Hmm? Oh.

Anyhow...

HE CLEARS THROAT

Soon, he, or "they" come to me.

Like I'm their relationship therapist.

Oh, would you pipe down and let me speak?

Let me finish a goddam sentence.

- Ready, guys?

I see the problem.

She's the problem.

Familiarity breeding contempt is the problem.

You need to ration your contact.

Ration how?

She's running through my head like a goddam tune I can't shake.

Well, we could upgrade your privileges, Jack.

Give you a little more control?

Shut up.

Sorry. Go on.

- Well...

Maybe if you had the ability to place Carrie on pause...

Now and then...

It'd make things easier for the both of you.

Do it.

Whatever. Whatever. Whatever! Do it.

ROLO:

So we upped his privileges.

You should be able to put her on pause.

That's it.

- OK.

Didn't take him long to use them.

So now we're just openly checking out women's racks?

JACK SIGHS

And don't say you weren't because

I can feel the fucking boner forming, OK?

And he checks her arse, too as she leaves. Holy fuck.

So I checked her out. What?

Damn. I'm horny as fuck.

Haven't jerked off in like a month.

Well... I'm not stopping you.

You're looking over my shoulder, but from the inside.

It's like trying to jerk off in front of a cop, who's also your mum.

Fuck you.

OK. You know what? That's it.

That's it. Time out.

I'm putting you on pause.

- No.

Jack, don't you dare!

Jack! Jack.

I'm warning you...

Not cool.

Don't do that again.

Are we at home?

Why the Halloween pumpkin?

Halloween's months from now.

Actually, it's today.

How long was I on pause?

Ah... Ju...

Just a few weeks.

I don't know. Eight?

Oh... OK. I know.

I'm... I'm sorry.

I know, I'm sorry.

I felt really bad, so, um...

I got you this.

I figured it's kind of our anniversary, so...

Fuck you.

You're a fucking arsehole.

Are you going to eat this cupcake or not?

Orange cream icing. It's your favourite.

- Where's Parker? I want to see Parker.

You had him away from me for months.

I want to see my boy.

OK.

SHE SOBS

OK.

CARRIE SOBS:

Where is he?

Hey.

Oh!

JACK:

What you got going on there?

Is that a fire truck?

- Yeah.

CARRIE SOBS AND LAUGHS

Tell him I love him.

Hey, buddy. Mummy loves you.

What?

SHE SOBS

Tell him I need a hug.

JACK:

You want to know something else?

Mummy needs a hug. Hmm?

EXHALES AND SOBS

ROLO:

Parker complicated things.

They both felt responsibility for him so they tried to compromise.

You know, reach an agreement, like adults.

Jack put Carrie on pause, except for the weekends.

When they'd take Parker out with Carrie in attendance kind of like a divorcee with visiting rights.

JACK AND PARKER LAUGH

PARKER SCREAMS PLAYFULLY

PARKER SHOUTS

- JACK: Again?

JACK CHUCKLES

PARKER SCREAMS

JACK:

You tricked me!

JACK GROWLS

PARKER:

Daddy!

INDISTINCT CHATTER

HEARTBEAT THUMPS

ROLO:

It worked OK.

For a while.

WOMAN:

Hey.

Looks like we're neighbours.

I've just moved in.

- Oh.

Emily.

- Jack, nice to meet you.

Oh, please.

JACK:

Hey.

Oh! Who's this?

It's Parker.

Cool name.

Guess I'll see you around?

Yeah.

Guess I'll see you around?

JACK:

She was nice, OK?

Oh, cut the shit.

I know when your hormones are flowing, OK?

Our balls are brewing up a blow load as we speak.

I can't. I'm with our son.

What's that? I didn't hit on anyone.

You know what?

Fuck it. Visiting time is over.

No, Jack. Don't you dare. Jack!

Jack, you son of a bitch...

Parker, wait up.

ROLO:

Anyhow as time passed by,

Jack got it on with the neighbour.

And Carrie didn't take it so good.

She works all week.

We just wanted to spend a weekend together.

Jesus, can't you just be happy for us?

No, Jack. Weirdly enough, I can't.

Christ, you are so bitter.

What? No. Why?

Is she giving you shit?

- Nm-mm.

Carrie, stop giving him shit.

- Tell her to back off.

J...

- Tell her.

Jesus Christ.

So the weekend thing isn't working.

JACK:

We tried limiting her to an hour.

But you can tell that she's in there, like that, judging and bitching.

The timeframe is frustrating for Carrie.

- Carrie is frustrating for us.

You got Carrie on pause now?

OK, well...

There's always deletion.

A... As in...

- As in permanent erasure.

Uh-huh?

- No.

That'd be killing her.

Mm, not legally.

But ethically?

Please, she's just some leftover code in your head. It'll be like...

Like deleting an email.

- No.

No. No deletion. I'm not doing it.

She wants to be near Parker.

I can't take that away from her.

There's got to be something you can do.

My friends...

You're in luck.

It's something we're beta testing.

It's actually aimed at terminally ill parents.

Kind of like a souvenir for their kids.

Here.

A monkey?

More like a keepsake.

We can put her in here.

In there?

- Uh-huh.

It's... It has a consciousness receptor

Kind of like the one we put in your head but... a prototype, and there's a camera here.

So she can see Parker.

Plus, the whole body's got haptic feedback so if little Parker gives it a cuddle, she'll feel it and she can communicate back, but in a kid-friendly, controlled way.

Yeah, I don't know.

I'm going to have to think about it.

I say yes.

Well, she's done her thinking.

How about you?

The transfer went pretty fast.

Carrie wouldn't have even been aware it was happening.

Until she woke up.

JACK:

Come on, buddy. You gotta tear it.

Tear into that thing.

CARRIE: Jack?

- JACK: You almost got it.

HE LAUGHS

There you go.

Alright, pull it out.

Oh, there you go.

PAPER CRINKLES

What is it, Parker?

JACK CHUCKLES

PARKER:

Monkey!

What?

JACK:

That's pretty cool, huh?

Jack? Jack? What the fuck?

JACK:

But you know something?

This... This, uh...

This is a very special monkey.

Mum wanted you to have it.

What?

Every time you hug it, Mum will know, and she'll feel that hug, too.

No, no, no, Jack.

Jack, put me back in your fucking head.

Jack!

And this monkey can speak to you.

It can let you know how it feels.

How did she speak?

Well, the comm setup was a little rudimentary.

I mean, this is a prototype.

Jack!

SHE SOBS

No...

MONKEY:

Monkey loves you.

What was that?

MONKEY:

Monkey needs a hug.

Give monkey a hug.

MONKEY:

Monkey loves you.

Monkey needs a hug.

Monkey... Monkey loves you.

Monkey loves you. Monkey...

SHE SCREAMS

Yeah, I think...

MONKEY: Monkey... Monkey...

Monkey... Needs a hug...

Monkey just needs a minute to get used to how things are going to be.

SHE SOBS

Now you listen.

You fucking bitch.

We can still have you wiped.

That what you want?

Do "monkey needs a hug" for "no".

MONKEY:

Monkey needs a hug.

Are you going to be a good toy?

Are you going to be a good toy?

MONKEY:

Monkey loves you.

You'd better.

PARKER CHUCKLES

ROLO:

Anyhow, in the end

Parker got tired of his new toy.

That's kids.

They're ingrates.

DOOR SHUTS

MONKEY:

Monkey needs a hug.

NISH:

Whoa.

Wait, so this is a crime museum?

Where's the crime in this?

- Well, the monkey is the crime.

A couple of years back the UN made it illegal to transfer human consciousnesses into limited formats like this.

Got to be able to express at least five emotions for it to be humane, apparently.

Human rights for cookies. Right, Carrie?

MONKEY:

Monkey needs a hug.

She's still in there?

It'd be illegal to delete her too, so, yeah...

Go figure.

Anyhow, ACLU raised one heck of a stink.

So thanks to this son of a monkey

I was out on my arse from TCKR and not even a severance package.

It's why I started this place.

Had to branch out somehow and it appealed to the carny in me, I guess

Monkey needs a hug.

- Goddam AC still not working.

Whew, it's hot!

ROLO GAGS

But I've kept you waiting too long.

CLEARS THROAT

You ready for the prime exhibit?

Step right this way.

Listen, I've got to warn you he's not the man he once was.

Ehem, sorry.

- Do you want some more water?

I'm fine.

EXHALES DEEPLY

He's this way.

ROLO GRUNTS

Come on, mister, you got a visitor.

TAPS ON GLASS

May I present Clayton Lee weathergirl killer.

ROLO COUGHS

I know, he's kind of mopey these days.

Cuts kind of a pathetic figure.

But don't feel too sorry for him.

He is a convicted murderer.

Lest we forget Denise Stockley.

Tragic and cute.

Ain't that right, Clayton?

Coo-eee!

He's actually looking at you.

Look out. Maybe you're his type.

He looks so real.

Well, it is him, or a fully conscious upload of him.

You're probably wondering how he got in here

After TCKR kicked me out my plan was to branch out into celebrity consciousness

Sign up famous people and reincarnate them as holograms after they die.

Kind of like a living

Madame Tussaud's.

But celebrities, that's just a quagmire.

Too many rights issues, arsehole representatives.

But convicted killers?

It's a different story.

PRISON ALARM BLARES

VISITOR: Michael was asking about you yesterday...

Take it to Jesus...

- I know it's hard...

DISTANT CHATTER

CLEARS THROAT

Mr Lee, allow me to introduce myself.

My name is Rolo Haynes.

- They say you're in technology.

Uh... Yes, that is true.

So you can look into this DNA thing?

Prove it wasn't me?

- Um...

Yes, that's certainly a possibility, but that's not why I'm here.

I have a proposal...

- Goodbye.

No, wait. I have a proposal.

I can help!

I can help your family!

How'd you talk him into it?

- ROLO SCOFFS

He didn't need much convincing.

So, really, it's just signing over the rights to your digital self in case the worst happens and I promise your relatives will receive the lion's share of any profits.

So if, you know, God forbid, you do get sent to the chair you know your family will be provided for, for life.

How did his family feel about it?

- They didn't give a shit.

Abandoned him the moment he got locked up.

I know, right?

Jesus Christ, Clay, it's your soul.

- Ain't no such thing.

It's just a computer simulation or something.

Then why does he need your permission?

If my pardon comes through, it won't matter.

And if it doesn't?

Then if they send me to the chair, this is going to pay.

It's going to keep you and the kids above water.

Maintain a roof over you all.

Baby, don't.

This could be a good thing.

But he never did get that pardon.

Shit no, cos he was guilty.

But wasn't there some doubt?

You know, that documentary?

Fake news. Hatchet job.

- What about the DNA tampering?

Seriously?

There's no doubt about it.

The day he got the chair was a great day for justice.

Clayton couldn't complain.

I mean, he was going to be a pioneer.

I was going to slurp up his entire consciousness.

He'd be the first guy on death row to survive his own execution.

HE BREATHES HEAVILY

ELECTRICITY BUZZES

The transfer went beautifully.

Before I knew it,

Clayton was born again.

ELECTRICITY ZINGS

Hi, buddy.

Congratulations to you.

You're in the afterlife, so to speak.

Looking good.

Am I a ghost?

If that helps, yeah.

TAPS KEYBOARD

I've just got to test a few things here... OK?

So this may seem a little weird.

Just hang on in there.

CLAYTON GASPS

What the fuck?

See, I knew just seeing the guy walking around captive, that was good but that wasn't much of a draw.

But pulling the lever yourself?

Now, that's an attraction.

ROLO SCOFFS

CLAYTON: Hey!

- OK.

Hey!

- Three, two, one...

HE SCREAMS

- ELECTRICITY BUZZES

Dawson's pain tech had paved the way for it.

A perfect recreation of exactly how the agony of electrocution feels.

Every volt simulated for real.

SCREAMS

- ELECTRICITY BUZZES

The key was, never let him exceed 15 seconds at max voltage.

That would wipe his digital synapses out for good, kill him.

SCREAMING CONTINUES

Ten seconds seemed to be the optimum shock length so that became the attractable limit.

OK, have a little rest.

Get used to your room.

Official opening's tomorrow.

CLAYTON PANTS

INDISTINCT CHATTER

ROLO:

In fact, in the early days the problem was fitting everyone in.

Please don't do it.

Please, please, please, please...

Please, please don't do it.

HE SCREAMS

But of course, it was really the souvenirs that were driving trade.

It was beautiful.

CLAYTON SCREAMS

Every time you finished juicing him out pops a conscious sentient snapshot of Clayton.

Not a recording a true copy of his mind perpetually experiencing that beautiful pain.

Stuck forever in that one perfect moment of agony.

Always on, always suffering.

And, what you'd call... fun size!

HE CHORTLES

COUGHS AND GAGS

Take a seat if it makes it easier.

COUGHS AND PANTS

GRUNTS AND SCREAMS

NISH:

Sit down.

BREATHES HEAVILY

What?

My accent?

Not fucking British.

Sorry to disappoint.

Who are you?

You're missing parts of the story out,

Mr Haynes. Why is that?

You forgot to mention the protests.

His wife started a campaign, got some momentum behind it.

Guess you'd call it virtue-signalling bullshit but I know it hurt your attendance.

And even the protesters got bored after a while.

As soon as it was clear the state wouldn't do a damn thing about clearing him they just moved onto the next viral miscarriage of justice they can hang a hashtag off of.

But they did their job, right?

This place was on the shit list.

Who was your core clientele after that?

You lost the day trippers, the tourists, the fun family crowd. Who was left?

You again, you pasty-faced motherfucker?

HE SCREAMS

NISH:

Loners. Sadists.

The supremacist sicko demographic.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Out, out, out.

HE SCREAMS

HE GASPS

And that crowd's not big enough.

They don't keep the lights on.

So if someone shows up some classic race-hate rich guy with a hard-on for power... and he slips you something extra for a longer time at the crank...

CLAYTON SCREAMS you take it.

CLAYTON SCREAMS

ALARM BLARES

Thank you.

NISH:

Wasn't the same after that, was he?

Not dead, but hardly alive either.

Even the perverts didn't want to pull a... a lever on a vegetable.

Where's the joy in that?

But someone came to see him, right?

She saw him.

She stood on this spot saw what you had done to him

Clay?

NISH:

He was like a docile animal.

God knows if he even recognised her.

God knows if he even recognises me.

WHISPERS:

Dad.

Happy birthday.

SHE SOBS

SHE SNIFFS

GASPING BREATHS

What my mum saw that day was more than she could take.

She had hoped during the whole fight to clear his name, but that just broke her

You know what she did when she came home?

Bottle of pills and a bottle of vodka.

I found her. You fucking piece of shit.

HE GRUNTS

Whoa...

Is it hot?

ROLO MOANS

It's humid, right? I'm sorry.

Stupid digital AC.

Easy to hack.

Never accept drinks from strangers.

DEVICE WHIRRS

My daddy taught me that.

Going by the colour of your lips, you're going to be gone in 30 seconds.

NISH SIGHS AND SNIFFS

Hey, don't worry.

We're going to see you on the other side.

DEVICE WHIRS

- NISH TYPES ON KEYBOARD

HE GASPS

NISH:

Hey.

Computer says you're awake.

Congratulations. You're a pioneer.

What the fuck did you do?

Turns out that it is possible to transfer a fresh consciousness inside a virtual one.

My daddy's giving you a ride.

Get me out of here, you fucking cu...

I'm guessing you're screaming and calling me names right now, but I wouldn't know.

You...

- I mean, my dad can't talk, thanks to you.

Otherwise I'm guessing he'd pass on your goodwill messages.

You fu... You fucking bitch!

You fucking bitch!

In other news, you'll shortly be undertaking another first.

The first double-decker mercy killing.

No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

I took off the 10-second limit so Daddy will get a full hit of juice.

Should be enough to set him free.

You, however... buried away inside there, Mr Haynes, you'll feel it all.

Hey!

- All the pain.

Fuck yo...

- Every perfect little shot of it.

Fuck you!

- I'm getting myself a souvenir, too.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Hey, please! Please!

Always on.

Always suffering.

Fuck! No! No! No!

Bye, Daddy.

ALARM BLARES

All good?

Just great, honey.

I'm proud of you.

[pounding dance music]

Hey.

Hey.

You here by yourself?

- So far.

- Oh.

It's a shame. A pretty girl like you.

- OK, corny.

- Oh!

Maybe I can make up for it by buying you a drink?

Sure.

- Bartender.

- Yeah?

Let me get a Buck and a vodka sidecar.

What makes you think

I want a vodka sidecar?

Maybe I know what you like.

[man] There they are.

Hey!

The ones who hooked up just so they can get the biggest room in the apartment.

[laughs] Very true.

- Let me get you all a drink.

- You're right.

Get your asses on the dance floor.

- Come on, girl.

- There we go.

Hey. That little role-play act, the stranger thing at the bar?

Got me hot as fuck.

Ooh. Mental note to self, my baby's into role-play.

[voice over music] The sound is yours...

You know it.

[Theo giggles]

[voice over music] What do you do when you dance in a club and the place is packed and jamming?

[heavy breathing]

[both grunt]

[video game noises]

[game] Round one. Fight.

[grunting and fighting sounds]

You're just in time.

Aww...

Man, I gotta work tomorrow.

Fuck your work.

New game.

[slightly muffled video game noises]

[Danny] No. No, no, no.

[men shout]

[Danny] No!

- Fuck.

- [game] Roxette wins.

All right, man.

- OK, one more.

- No, man. It's too late.

Decision made.

Shit.

Oh, look, he picks Roxette again.

But you've been Lance for 20 bouts straight.

- Come on.

- I know you not bitching.

- Where we going, Panda Mountain?

- Sucks.

- Crystal Beach?

- Let's go for the Temple.

- Here we go.

- Secret Temple.

- Get ready to get your ass kicked.

- Yeah? Roxette's gonna fuck your head off.

- That don't even make sense.

- Fuck your head off.

What does that mean?

Round one. Fight.

Come on. Come on.

Oh!

[laughs]

All right, get up, come on. Come on.

Come on.

No.

Get out of here.

- [Roxette] You like? What now?

- Negative.

[both shout]

- Come on, man.

- [Roxette] That's done.

[game] K.O. Perfect.

[Theo] You woke me up.

Too damn loud.

- [Karl] You want some of this?

- Baby.

"Baby."

- Quiet that shit down.

- Baby.

Baby! Baby! Baby!

[woman] Birthday boy!

Birthday boy.

[laughs]

Hey.

Congratulations. How old are you now?

Uh, 38.

- Forty's a-coming.

- Yeah.

Soon be dead, huh?

Sure.

- Have you met Simon?

- Hey.

Uh...

- Don't think so.

- I don't think we did, no, no.

OK. Simon's into bikes.

That's cool.

- [kids screaming]

- Cool. That's cool.

Maxwell. We don't kick. No kicking.

Look at him. Sorry. I'm sorry.

- Do you like motorcycles or just bikes?

- Just bikes.

Cool.

[cool funk music plays on radio]

[children laugh]

- [boy] Tag!

- Tyler, go on outside.

- [bowl smashing]

- Sorry!

- Sorry.

- Let me...

- I'll get that.

- Did he get it on you?

Yeah, you just... Don't worry.

[doorbell buzzes]

[sighs]

Karl.

- Hey, Theo.

- I have not seen you in how long?

However long, it feels longer.

Is Daisy parking the car?

Oh, uh...

Me and Daisy, no, we're not together anymore.

Oh, God, I'm sorry.

No, no, no. It's... it's cool, really, we broke up, like, a year ago.

No clue. He... I'm not on Facebook, so...

I can be a dumbass about these things.

No. Really, it's all good.

We're still friends. Better friends, actually. It's all very adult.

- Well, come in, come in.

- All right.

- Danny's out back.

- OK.

[meat sizzling]

We're not gonna punch, we're not gonna kick. OK?

- I'm sorry.

- Oh, God.

[woman] OK, go play, no fighting.

Goddamn it. Come on.

Can't beat a little home cooking.

[Karl laughs]

- Hey, man.

- What's going on?

Oh, wow, handshake?

What am I, like, infected or something?

Fuck you.

[laughs] Come on, get in here, man.

Ah, that's better, let it out, buddy, let it out.

You're still an asshole, I see.

Happy birthday.

Oh, wow.

When did you start using gift bags?

The store did that.

You gonna open it?

- Striking Vipers.

- X. Striking Vipers X.

Newest instalment.

Came out just yesterday.

I was in the store,

I saw it and...

Oh, man. [laughs]

This takes me back.

It says here you need one of those VR add-ons.

- I don't have one of those.

- Yes, you do.

- No.

- Eh...

No. No, come on, man.

No. It's your birthday, just take the damn thing, would you?

Seriously, you gonna flip the fuck out.

I tried it out in the store.

They demoed it for me.

Five minutes blew my mind to confetti.

- Thanks, man.

- It's all good.

That your one?

No, that's Maxwell.

[Simon] Maxwell. Guys, guys.

Tyler's friend from school.

- You want a beer, man?

- Finally he saves me. Yes.

Thank you.

[girl] Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,

I've been playing with Katie.

[woman] Theo, are we using the plastic cups?

Theo's looking good.

Uh-huh.

Good to see at least one of you still has a gym membership.

Oh, really?

Seriously, man.

You're walking around like a fucking Frankenstein movie.

Look, since my knee went, I haven't been able to work out, all right?

I'm not using that as an excuse.

I'm just...

- No, no, no, of course not.

- Hey, fuck you, all right?

I can afford to let things slide.

I'm settled.

I thank God I don't have to be out there on the dating scene.

Always on sale. Fucking bullshit.

It is like a second job.

Gotta keep up with those younger dudes.

You gotta do a thousand crunches a day?

- Only 50 each morning.

- Fifty in the morning?

Mm-hmm.

You wax your ballsack?

I'm sure as shit those young dudes do.

You wax your ball... You nasty.

Till it's gleaming like an eight ball.

[both laugh]

Just to stay in the game.

- I pity you, really.

- Yeah. Well...

You wanna know where I'm going after I leave here?

Shit, getting your taint waxed too?

Meeting Mariella.

- Mariella.

- She does backing vocals.

What, for the school band?

How old is she?

Twenty-nine.

No, 28. See. Here she is again.

- Yeah.

- [shushes]

- You wanna share that with the class?

- Mm-mm.

- You lucky man.

- I am, me.

What are you doing? What are you doing?

[laughs]

- Tyler asleep?

- Mm-hmm.

Had to read that damn Macaroo book again before he'd let me put out the light.

"Macaroo found a shoe..."

"And put it in a tree."

Macaroo's got no respect for his environment, that's all I'm saying.

- I can do that.

- No, I'm fine.

Mm-mm. It's your birthday, come on.

- Thank you.

- [grunts]

OK.

You know, you should've told me that Karl and Daisy broke up.

- Did he say who broke up with who?

- I didn't ask.

I always said that those two were not good news together.

So long since I saw him last.

- Had to be last year's birthday, I think.

- In the flesh, a whole year?

Him and the girl on his phone, is that serious?

I didn't ask.

Guys suck at talking.

How long have you two known each other?

You don't actually get to talk at these things, though, do you?

I mean, beyond surface bullshit.

Or parent talk.

There's a lot of that these days.

Y'all should hang out more.

Yeah, well, you know, work.

And we're parents.

He's downtown with the label and we're out here.

We should have him over for dinner.

You could make your chili.

Sure.

[machine] Flatware hazard warning.

You gotta put the knives in sharp edge down.

- [machine beeping]

- I know.

Check out the Rodman look on this guy.

How are you? Yeah?

Rodman?

Dennis Rodman.

- He used to be a ball player, right?

- Right.

The hair. Got it.

The app says we need to do it within the hour. It's peak fertility.

I'm kind of beat but I guess that we should.

You not into it?

I just ate so much, I don't know if I can.

- It's best to save it up, though, right?

- Mm-hmm.

Mind if I go to sleep?

No.

[Theo groans]

I love you, baby.

Love you, too.

[pants]

[both chuckle]

Shit.

[TV chimes]

- Hey, man.

- Hey, you still awake? You wanna game?

Maybe not tonight. I was...

Come on, what are you playing?

Something goddamn boring is what I'm guessing.

All right, you got me.

All right, so grab the experiencer disc

I got you, put it on and jump in.

Seriously, man, it's insane.

You're gonna freak. You're gonna shit your pelvis through your asshole.

- OK. What do I do?

- All right, they showed me in the store.

- You put the game chip in.

- Done.

Now grab the disc doohickey and stick it upside your head.

- Left or right side?

- Doesn't matter.

- Done.

- OK.

Now hold down the sync button on the controller.

Nothing's happening.

We haven't chosen our fighters yet.

So, I am...

[game] Roxette.

OK, so where's my guy?

- [game] Lance.

- Damn. All right, Lance, let's go.

OK, you have to brace yourself.

Brace myself. Come on.

- You ready?

- Yeah, I'm ready.

Three, two...

- one.

- [game chimes]

[Danny] Whoa!

[Danny] Oh, my God.

[Danny] Whoa!

[Danny's voice melds into Lance]

This is crazy.

- What the fuck...?

- Yo, Danny.

Said you gotta brace yourself.

Karl?

Crazy shit, huh?

Like, I feel solid.

You think your chest is impressive?

Check this shit out.

[Karl as Roxette] Whoo!

- This is just...

- I know, right?

How's the knee?

Pretty good.

- [Roxette grunts]

- [Lance chuckles]

Man, in here, you can do so much shit you can't do out there.

[roars]

OK, enough of the Captain Acrobat shit.

- You ready to fight?

- I'm ready.

[game] Round one.

[game] Fight.

[Danny as Lance]

Whoa. Hold on a minute.

Is this going to hurt?

"The game emulates all physical sensations."

Is that a yes or a no?

It does.

[both grunt]

Peace out.

I'm gonna fuck you up.

Thunder punch.

Windmill wipe-out.

[laughs]

That the best you can do, man?

Jesus Christ.

Don't worry, it resets. No harm done.

That's messed up.

[game] Round two.

- Hold on. Shit, I'm rusty.

- Fight.

I can't remember what moves this guy can do.

It's like riding a bike.

- See? Nice block.

- Thanks.

Hyperstrike!

That's double.

Tornado fury.

The leg, the leg, the leg, the leg.

[Danny grunting]

[both pant]

No. No. No, no, no. No, no, no.

How do I get out of here?

How do I get out of here?

Exit game.

Exit... Exit game!

[pants]

Oh, shit.

Holy shit.

Hello. Where did he come from?

[sighs]

[indistinct chatter]

[beeping]

That's my cab.

- Good night, little man.

- Good night.

- Take care of Daddy for me, OK?

- OK.

Mm-hmm.

I'm not sure when I'll be back.

Depends on traffic, I guess.

Have fun, OK?

[electronic disco music]

[game] Battle stations.

[game] Battle stations.

"his shoe and put it in a tree."

Very good. "The shiny side made a slide.

He slid down happily."

[Danny] "He fixed the leaves..."

[game] Game over.

[TV chimes]

[TV chimes]

Hey, there.

Hey. I can't play long, I...

Oh, sure, me too.

[Danny] Look...

Last time we played,

I was drunk, man, from the party.

Me, too.

Cool.

OK.

Be good to have a serious game, you know?

Serious game.

Serious game.

Here we go.

About to kick your ass, motherfucker.

Yeah? You're gonna try.

[game] Round one. Fight.

[Roxette shouts]

- Come on, come on! Please, please!

- Stop it! No! I'm going.

Can you hear me? Yes.

Can you hear me now?

You're the driver, right?

Yeah, I'm outside of the Taphouse.

Taphouse.

[horn honks]

So, guess that's us gay now.

That's a joke.

Huh.

Don't feel like a gay thing.

[grunts]

- What is it?

- Jesus.

Exit game.

[shouts]

What? You're supposed to be in bed.

I'm thirsty.

You're thirsty?

[door closing]

- You finished?

- Yes.

Yes what?

- Yes, thank you.

- [chuckles] Go ahead.

- [Tyler] Hey, Mom.

- [Theo] Hey there, little man.

- Looks like you can use one of these.

- Mm-hmm.

Feels like a dog died in my damn head.

[both chuckle]

You weren't supposed to drink.

I figured my period was late.

And I hoped it was.

And then it came on while I was out, so.

I just said fuck it.

I'm sorry.

Next time.

Nose kiss.

[indistinct conversation]

[machine] Please rinse dishes before program start.

[water running]

[game] Round one. Fight.

[Roxette grunts]

I'm sorry, baby. I'm just tired, OK?

[horns honking]

[Karl as Roxette] OK,

I know when you're thinking.

What's up?

How does it feel?

I mean, like, for you, being in a woman's body while...

Crazy.

It's crazy.

I mean, it's different.

Like... the physical feeling of it?

It's more sort of... satisfying.

I can't really explain it.

Like, one's a guitar solo, the other's a whole fucking orchestra.

But the tune's basically the same.

Different tempos, though.

Yeah, I think you've run that analogy to the ground.

Fuck you.

[child playing]

I'd like you to push my feet down.

Listen here, mister.

Listen here.

[phone vibrates]

[phone beeps]

Shit.

[phone beeps]

[people laughing]

♪ While I'm alone and blue as can be ♪

♪ Dream a little dream of me ♪

♪ Stars fading... ♪

- Hey.

- Hi.

Can I, uh...

Should I not? I was just gonna ask if I could buy you a drink.

- I'm sorry.

- Oh, God.

- Yeah.

- I'm so sorry.

Don't be.

- No, seriously.

- Seriously.

[both laugh]

I'll leave you alone.

Mm-hmm.

Sorry.

Hey.

- [waiter] It's all good?

- It was great, thank you.

Your dessert's on the way.

That was good.

Hmm.

- Mm-hmm.

- [Theo chuckles]

You know the thing about you?

Sometimes you just sort of go away.

- What do you mean?

- I mean, you shrivel away.

You go inside. Leave me on the outside.

Are you in there?

[exhales] Of course I am.

OK. So then, what's up?

Nothing.

We haven't done it in weeks.

I've been tired.

- We're meant to be trying again.

- We are trying again.

No. Won't get pregnant if you don't fuck me, Danny.

Jesus.

It's not that I don't want to.

I said I've been tired.

I'm sorry... but is something going on?

Something going on?

That's what I said.

Nothing is going on.

Then what is it?

- Is it me?

- No.

- You don't touch me anymore.

- Theo.

You don't even kiss me.

There is none of the small stuff.

Squeeze my shoulder.

A hand on my back as you pass me in the kitchen.

- Theo.

- Not even that.

Do you want me any more?

I'll always want you.

No. You know what I mean,

I mean, me. This. This.

I know that I'm not what I was.

My body is not what it was since Tyler.

Don't say that.

Are you seeing someone?

No.

No.

So why don't you want me?

You always used to want me.

[breathes shakily]

It's boring, I get that.

Family life?

Shit, I find it boring.

But I am loyal.

I'm loyal to our family. I'm loyal to you.

God knows if I wanted,

I could go out and do whatever.

You think I haven't made sacrifices?

I haven't denied things for myself?

A guy at the bar earlier tried hitting on me.

Half of me wanted him to, just for some excitement, some fucking passion.

But that is what you do.

It's part of being in a partnership, you shut the door on all that shit.

You shut it out because you have committed.

It's what a commitment is.

Oh, God.

If something's going on, I just...

I just want to know.

I'll deal with it how I deal with it.

I just have to know.

Nothing is going on.

I promise.

I swear.

[waiter] One chocolate bombe.

And two spoons.

Enjoy.

- [Karl grunts]

- [Mariella] That's it. That's good.

Sorry.

I'm not gonna get there.

You're worrying about your work again?

I think so.

OK.

Mind if I finish myself off?

Mm.

[sounds of porn]

[TV chimes]

[phone vibrates]

[phone rings]

Hold on. Excuse me, I gotta take this.

Hello.

Hey.

Whoa, what do you mean?

It means I can't do it anymore.

It's not fair to Theo.

[haltingly] But it's not cheating.

It's not real.

It's like... porn or something.

Come on, man, you know it ain't right.

- I gotta think of Theo.

- OK. But... we don't have to completely cut it off.

What about, like, first Sunday of each month?

- No.

- Just now and then.

Karl, it has to stop. Clean break.

Come on. This is good. This is good.

You know it is.

Look, I gotta go.

- I'm sorry.

- Danny.

- Goodbye.

- Danny.

[Danny] I gotta get past you, you ready?

Go.

[Danny] All right.

[Danny] You win.

[shouts]

[phone chimes]

[Danny] And he is down.

- Macaroo found that shoe again, huh?

- And put it in a tree.

Happy birthday.

- Oh!

- Sorry it's not much. I couldn't get out.

- It's exactly what I wanted.

- [laughs]

Thank you.

That smells good.

It's the sort of red-meat caveman food you like.

- Yeah. That's a hell of a serving size.

- Yeah.

You having your hunger pangs again?

- There's three of us eating tonight.

- I know, that's what I said.

I mean, three adults. I invited Karl over.

Surprise.

Karl?

Yeah, well, last year you said you hardly got to see him.

You didn't get to speak to him at that barbecue we had.

So I emailed him last week.

And what did he say?

He said he was looking forward to it.

[doorbell buzzes]

Speak of the devil.

[Theo] Oh, my God, you remember that crazy dude that lived downstairs when we were at Madeley?

He used to bang on the ceiling when we played the music.

He had a point, though, because we were loud.

[Danny] Mm-hmm.

Baby, you remember the time that you got that molly and you insisted that we all take it?

I had to go to work the next day.

- [Karl laughs]

- Lord. We were young, I guess.

Well.

Hennessey and dessert is as crazy as it gets now.

Speaking of dessert, it's almost ready.

What the fuck are you doing?

- Just eating.

- That's not what I mean, OK?

Why the fuck did you come?

She asked me to come.

What do you want me to say?

- An excuse.

- Such as what?

Such as anything.

What am I? Your ex-wife or something?

Look, it's too strange, OK?

It's just too fucking strange.

I'll tell you what's strange.

Nothing matches it, does it?

I tried replacing it, man. I tried.

I tried fucking the computer-controlled characters.

- It's bullshit.

- Shut up.

It's like a rubber doll.

Not programmed for any sex stuff.

They just sort of lie there.

I tried it with real players.

Other folks controlling Lance.

There was this one guy from Holland.

He was kind of halfway OK as long as

I didn't think about this accent.

But it didn't get me.

It didn't get me, not like when we're in there. You and me.

Stop it.

I tried everything.

I've gone in there as guy players, girl players, multi-player gangbangs, you name it.

You know, I even fucked Tundra, the polar bear character.

I fucked a polar bear and I still couldn't get you out of my mind.

I can't help you.

You want to fuck Roxi again.

- I don't.

- You do.

- Just...

- The best sex of my life.

Best of yours too.

Fucking transcendent. You know it was.

Think about it.

Think about her. Roxi.

Holding her, her warm skin against yours.

- Please.

- Her tight wet pussy.

- Fuck, man.

- She'll be in there at midnight.

Just come on in one last time.

You know you want to. One last time.

What y'all doing?

[chuckles]

- Bullshit.

- Bullshit, yeah.

That looks good.

Baby, your plate.

- Is that your tiramisu?

- Mm-hmm. You know it.

World famous.

Good to see you.

Happy birthday, man.

It was good to see you.

Yeah, you, too.

Lord, hug each other.

Guys can be so awkward.

Midnight.

- Bye.

- Good night.

[Danny sighs]

[Roxette grunts]

I love this.

I love you.

No.

No.

No. No!

- I don't know where that came from.

- Where the fuck does this go?

[shouts]

You're feeling it, too.

Just say it.

Say it.

What the fuck do you want?

Where does this end?

Who says it has to end?

Huh?

[shouts]

- You remember the Year Club?

- Danny.

The old club, the Year.

Of course I do, why?

Car lot out back.

Meet me there in 30 minutes.

Exit game.

- OK.

- We're not gonna fight.

We're gonna kiss.

Kiss?

Like... kiss.

It's the only way. We gotta know.

Know...

If there are fireworks, then, OK, bam, it's an "us" thing, whatever.

At least we've got a foothold on it.

So let's just fucking kiss.

OK.

I said OK.

I'm working up to it.

- You want me to start?

- I don't know.

Yeah.

OK.

You ready?

Just fucking kiss me, man.

Nope. Not a damn thing.

No, me neither.

Huh.

So that settles it.

You know it's different in the game.

No. You got to get that shit out of your head.

- It ain't coming out.

- No.

- It's burrowed right in there.

- No, fuck you.

Burrowed right in there, man.

- I know it, you know it.

- Hey. Hey.

It's buried in there, huh?

- Maybe we can get rid of it like that.

- Don't push me, man.

- You a big man? What you gonna do?

- Don't push me.

What you gonna do?

OK.

Stop.

Stop! Stop!

[siren blares]

[men grunt]

- My husband's here. Danny, Daniel Parker.

- Daniel Parker. Yeah.

I knew y'all were mad at each other over dinner.

So, what were you fighting about?

Hello?

Holy fuck!

Talk to me.

[children chatter]

[Danny] You guys, bring the kids in.

Hey.

You guys make great babies.

- Ours look like a mile of bad road.

- What?

I wish I was a baby-sitter.

## 2. Smithereens



Now, once more return your attention to the breath.

Notice how your breathing continues... all by itself.

Your mind may wander.

Simply watch it go.

Calmly.

And without judgment.

- Hiya.

- Hi.

God, that was so fast. I didnt realize youd be parked right here.

- Yeah, just dropped somebody off.

- Oh, its my lucky day then.

Im going to Old Street...

Oh, youve got the details.

So you work in that place?

Hmm?

Sorry, miles away, I didnt catch that.

Is that where you work, where I picked you up?

At Smithereen? No.

Just visiting.

I mean, I wish I worked there.

The facilities theyve got in there, theyve got their own spa. Its madness.

Thats Billy Bauer money for you.

Anyway.

My daughters name was Kristin

Krissie.

Twenty years old. She was at university.

She killed herself, took her own life, whatever you wanna call it,

18 months ago now.

And it was out of the blue.

One of her flatmates called me.

Theyd found her in the bathroom.

And Im furious with her!

Im so fucking angry with her for not telling me.

I thought I knew, I...

I didnt know.

Last time I spoke, she was happy... and just like that, she ended everything.

And I dont know why she did it.

Ive asked myself why a million times.

Was it over some boy or her course or the state of the world or me?

Was it something I did?

Round and round in my head but theres no answer, theres nothing.

Shes not here to say, so... its never gonna stop, this... needing to know.

Its never gonna stop.

Talk about nerve-racking.

That was my first time speaking.

I mean, in front of everyone. Tough crowd.

Oh, you did really well.

- Really?

- Yeah.

First time, though, shit scary, isnt it?

Well, to be honest, I dont know.

Have you...

You havent spoken while Ive been here.

I mean, is it...

I just havent found the right moment yet.

Waiting for the right moment.

- Anyway.

- Hey, um, do you fancy a drink?

Oh, Ive got a bit of a long day tomorrow.

Come on. Might die tomorrow.

Joke.

Oh, God. Oh, my God.

Oh, my God. I needed that.

Its okay. Its okay.

- I wanna make you cum, too.

- In a bit maybe.

- Just need a bit... bit of a breather.

- Its been ages.

Cant even remember the last time.

- Sorry, do you mind if I...?

- No, no, no.

I know these things are undignified.

Went on a date about four months back with a guy off an app.

Halfway through the starter,

I tell him about Kristin.

He reacted like I said Id got cancer.

Thats her.

Ah.

Her flatmate sent that to me.

It was in her room.

Shit. Okay, give me a minute.

Im trying to get into Kristins Persona account.

I try logging in every day.

It gives you three wrong guesses, then locks you out for hours.

Every time I think of a guess,

I write it in here.

This week Im into places we went on holiday.

Im her mum. Youd think theyd give me the password to my own daughters account, but, no.

Violates their privacy policy.

Theyll memorialize it if you prove youre next of kin.

Makes it sort of sepia with a tribute photo, but that deletes the inbox.

I just want the inbox.

I dont know, see if theres a reason, an answer.

I dont know what I want. Okay.

Right.

Okay.

Well, theres tomorrow.

Notice how your breathing continues... all by itself.

Your mind may wander.

Simply watch it go.

Calmly and without judgment.

Im on my way now.

Yeah. Uh-huh.

My first-class check-in San Francisco flights not for another three hours, so there should be time.

Yeah, yeah, Im hopping in the car now.

Okay. Okay, bye.

Uh, uh, airport, yeah?

Terminal Three.

- Do you work in that place?

- Smithereen? Yeah.

The sat navs showing an accident coming up.

Do you mind if I follow an alternate route its showing me?

Its actually quicker than the normal way.

- Uh, yeah, thats fine.

- Might be a bit twisty but this thing always seems to know what its doing.

Mm-hmm.

Uh...

Put this on. Put it on.

Put it on!

Round your wrists.

Loop it round your wrists.

- Uh, why are you...

- Just shut up and do it.

- Come on. Pull it tight.

- Im trying. Im trying.

Use your teeth. Pull it with your teeth!

- Uh, what...

- Shut up!

Nothings gonna happen to you if you just do what I say. Okay?

Youre okay. Just do what I say.

Stay there.

Fucking...

Is this about money?

I know I work for Smithereen but that doesnt mean Ive got money!

Dont need to...

What... What are you doing, man?

Im just an intern.

- What are you doing?

- What did you say?

- What did you say?

- Im just an intern.

With a suit, the luggage, the... suitcase?

Why are you going to the airport?

Its outfits.

Clothes are in there for Vanessa.

- Who the fuck is Vanessa?

- Vanessa Lampton.

Shes an exec at Smithereen.

Her stylist told me that I need to go to Heathrow.

Shes got a bunch of outfits and shes gotta pick one.

Thats my job, man. Im just an intern.

So why are you dressed like that?

Thats a suit.

- Youre wearing a fucking suit.

- Its my first week.

Oh, fuck!

Fuck! Fuck!

Okay.

- Fuck!

- Fuck!

Modern fucking companies!

Everyone looks so fucking young!

How is anybody looking in supposed to have a sense of the fucking hierarchy?!

Jesus Christ! Half of you cunts coming out of the building are dressed like fucking gap-year students.

I mean, what...?

Fuck! Children.

The whole Smithereen building is a box full of fucking children getting their fingers everywhere.

Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep...

Wiping your shit.

Your fucking app shit up on everybodys phone.

Everywhere you look, people are hooked on the things!

Its like chain-smoking. Did you make a lot of cash out of that, did you?

And you lot are hooked on them as well.

Every single person that comes out of that buildings going...

People dont even look up anymore.

The sky could turn fucking purple and you cunts wouldnt notice for a month.

You didnt look up and look where that got you, sitting in the back like that.

An intern. Why didnt you dress like a fucking intern?! Jesus!

All right, work with it, work with it.

Work with...

Fuck.

- Stop! Stop!

- Dont kill me.

- Ill shoot you!

- No, no!

Dont move.

- Im trying to breathe! Im sorry.

I cant go in there.

Ive got claustrophobia, man.

Im claustrophobic.

Please, please, please!

Just get in. Just do as I say.

- Please.

- Stay fucking quiet.

Please! Please!

- I just cant be in small...

- Oh, fucking hell.

Help! Please.

- Okay. Shut up, shut up, shut up.

- Please, please.

Okay, okay.

Look at me.

You can sit in the back seat if you put this on and you dont move.

- Okay? Okay?

- I wont, I wont, I wont move.

- Okay.

- Do I have to put it on?

Yeah.

Ill fucking kill you if you dont keep down.

Fucking hell.

Okay. Lie down.

Im gonna be sick.

Be quiet. Youre okay.

Im gonna... Im gonna be sick, please.

- Get down!

- Please, Im gonna be sick.

- Im gonna throw up. Please.

- Get down!

What are these?

They didnt have cheese and onion.

Fucks sake.

- Im gonna throw up.

- Oh, God! Fucking down or Ill shoot you!

- Did you see that?

- See what?

Something in that car.

It looked like someone with a bag on their head.

What?

No, lets check it out.

Just get fucking down!

Yeah, look, that one up ahead.

See it? The blue one?

Uh, Mrs. Kent, its, uh, Jaden.

What... What, are you at the airport?

Youve not found Vanessa?

No, no, no, listen.

Im in a car with a man and hes got a gun and he needs to speak to Billy Bauer.

- Hello? He needs to speak to Billy Bauer.

- Who needs to speak to Billy Bauer?

The man does, the gunman.

Okay, Jaden,

I dont know what youre talking about.

Can you slow down?

I dont understand what...

- Look, Im...

- Listen carefully. Ive got a gun.

Ive got your employee.

And Im going to shoot him unless you get me Billy Bauer on the phone right now. Im serious.

The police are here.

Theyre looking at me.

Im stuck here, Ive got a fucking gun.

Theres not much time.

I didnt want to do it like this but I need to speak to Bauer now.

Okay. Is this a joke?

- No.

- No!

I think he just took a photo.

Did you get that?

Yes.

- Thats your guy Jaden, yeah?

- Yes.

Dont hurt him.

If you get me Billy Bauer on the phone, no one gets hurt.

I just wanna speak with Billy Bauer on... on the phone.

- Okay, I dont know how to get to Billy.

- But you can find out.

I can try to.

Can you stay on the line?

Now.

Oh, Im staying on the line.

- You sure its not a prank?

- I cant be a hundred percent, but I dont wanna call the US if this is bullshit.

Its still bloody morning over there.

Oh, God.

Hey, Maryam, this is early even for you.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

Holy shit.

Okay.

Have Don and Shonelle meet me in the boardroom in ten.

Here comes the hotstepper.

- Get a cordon going.

- Come on, lads.

- Did you get a look at the hostage yet?

- Yeah. Hoods off, hes in the back.

Early twenties, by the looks of him.

- This is David Gilkes, negotiator.

- Either of you speak to the suspect?

For like a second when he pulled the gun.

- He seem pissed up? On something?

- No, just angry.

Lets cut back on the razzmatazz.

I know its tense but were not risking a shit storm like the whole Stretton thing with poor old Mr. Starter Pistol.

- Maam, I...

- Yes, I know but he was unarmed and it was less than a month ago.

Memories arent that short yet.

So no critical shot unless theres absolutely no choice.

- Okay?

- Maam.

- Your lace is undone.

- Maam, theyve IDd the car.

Its registered to an Eleanor Kathleen Gillhaney, sixty-seven years old, listed under an address in Ewelme.

- Thats, what, couple of miles from here?

- Yeah.

- I know Ewelme.

- Okay, you two go and give it a knock.

- See if shes okay.

- Yes, maam.

Maam,

Im gonna get these cars out of the way.

Right.

Pen, we have to tell Billy whats happening.

If this thing ends in a shoot-out, he should at least be aware of the situation.

- Got a hit.

- He could start making other demands.

- One moment, Don. What is it?

- Okay, the cell hes calling from,

I ran it through everything and got a match.

Its registered as a two-step verification number on this account.

Pull out whatever we can get on this guy.

Hes still on hold, right?

Got him listening to a playlist.

♪ I wanna hold you so much ♪

Billy Bauer.

You know, hes not gonna pay a ransom on me.

- Do they know if its a terror thing yet?

- No one knows anything.

You should just go home.

- Timelines going nuts.

- Lets see.

- Control, IC3 hostage...

- Maam.

We know who the hostage is.

Hes from Smithereen.

- The social whatever company?

- Yeah. They contacted the Met to say one of their interns is being held at gunpoint.

Jaden Tommins. The gunman sent a photo.

Shit.

Hed been sent on an errand.

They booked a cab through the Hitcher app.

Hes not in a cab now. Call Hitcher, get what we can on the driver.

- We got the number that sent that photo?

- Yep.

Run the call data through intel.

What did he say to them?

- Did he give a name?

- He wouldnt tell them anything but he did say he needs to speak to Billy Bauer on the phone.

Billy Bauer as in Billy Bauer?

-  Hello.

- Im here.

This is Penelope Wu from Smithereen.

I understand youve asked to speak with Mr. Bauer.

Thats right.

So have you got Billy Bauer on the line?

- Hello?

- Sorry. Uh, yes.

Were doing everything we can.

May I speak to Jaden?

- Hes fine.

- I just need to check hes okay.

- Tell them youre okay.

- Uh, Im okay.

There. So youd better hurry up and get Billy Bauer on the phone.

Its still very early where he is.

- Were having difficulty reaching him.

- Thats not my problem.

Well, meantime could you maybe outline what this is regarding?

No. Im only speaking to him.

Sure, its just... Im actually the COO.

Okay. And?

Well, it might be quicker if I can present him with a...

Just fucking get Billy Bauer on the phone right now.

Im not fucking around here.

I will blow his fucking head off!

- Do you understand?

- Im sorry, of course, I apologize.

Im gonna put you back on hold.

I promise you we are working on it.

Dont be long!

Well, hes not stable.

Oh, in what way, Don?

Jesus Christ.

I dont think that music helped him any.

But I switched the line so now while hes hearing that, we can listen in to see whats happening at his end.

Fucking messing me around.

This is my last day.

This is my last day. This is my last day.

This is my last day. This is my last day.

This is my last day.

This is my last day. This is my last day.

This is my last day. This is my last day.

This is my last day.

This is my last day. This is my last day.

- Got a weird one here.

- Naj.

Fucking hell, thats him.

All right, this is mad, look.

Oh, great.

Everything all right?

Yeah, were looking for an Eleanor Gillhaney.

Bit late.

She, uh, died in March.

♪ We could be lifted ♪

♪ Lifted ♪

♪ Oh, we could be ♪

Okay, guys, stand by for instruction.

Thats her son.

Chris, Christopher.

He moved in when she died.

Well, couple of months at any rate.

- On his own?

- Yeah, keeps to himself.

Drives to work each morning, think he works somewhere in London.

Has something happened to him?

Got a positive ID on the suspect.

Names Christopher Gillhaney.

Okay.

He seems to be staying at his late mums place.

Lots of red bills, and its up for repossession.

What have you got on the suspect?

Former teacher.

- Sorry? Hes a teacher?

- Well, he was a teacher. IT.

Hes been registered unemployed going on two years.

- Hows his record?

- Fully DBS checked, hes squeaky clean.

Only place he shows up is as a victim in a road traffic accident,

November 2015.

Drunk driver plowed right into him.

Two dead, including the drunk.

- Okay, good work, Najma.

- Maam.

Teacher with a real gun?

- Not impossible, but not likely.

- Maam, its the FBI.

- What?

- Its the FBI. Urgent call.

Chief Superintendent Grace.

Hi, Chief Superintendent.

This is Ernesto Cruz from the FBI.

Right. Sorry, whats this regarding?

Were liaising with Smithereen,

Silicon Valley. Theyre also on this call.

What, theyre on the line as well?

Yes, hi, this is Penelope Wu from Smithereen.

With me is Don from legal and Shonelle from analytics.

Uh, David Gilkes, negotiator.

Listen, Ms. Wu, weve identified the suspect.

Christopher Michael Gillhaney, former schoolteacher, thirty-three years old.

He has a Smithereen profile.

- Right.

- So first off, Christophers on hold but we are able to listen in to his end of the line so well share live feed of that with you guys.

Yeah. Thats useful.

In addition, we figure we could share the data we have on him to assist negotiations at your end, but first, perhaps you could share with us your perception of what hes doing.

Probably extortion, whether its targeted at your company is something we dont...

Oh, its targeted.

- Sorry?

- Were looking into who Christopher is.

Group-wise wed slot him into high intellect, low income.

Often angry people.

Right, well, we checked to see if hed ever expressed hostile sentiments towards Smithereen as an entity but nothing shows up on his social.

In fact, theres been nothing there at all for some time.

- His whole account is dormant.

- I dont see how this is relevant.

But then we checked in with the Hitcher guys.

- Right.

- So the cab that picked Jaden up is registered to an Omar Masimbalu.

And a name like that,

I think youll agree, does not exactly match Mr. Gillhaney.

- No.

- Turns out it was a compromised account.

People trade them on the dark web.

Seems likely Chris got a hold of it that way.

You appreciate what Im saying?

- Hes been covering his tracks.

- Uh-huh.

So we asked Hitcher to share his account activity and it seems for weeks, hed been only accepting jobs specifically outside the Smithereen London address.

Just parked up each day waiting until he got a job from someone inside the building.

This... This is a whole plan hes had going on here.

I mean, this is sophisticated criminal behavior.

I find it hard to believe hes never raised red flags before.

His records totally clean.

- I mean, he was the victim in...

- The auto accident in 2015.

He lost his fiancée in that crash.

Were you aware of that?

No.

But you are.

There were historical posts inside his network, condolences, memorials, and thats when Chris disengages, in fact, not interacting with friends even though hes expressing grief.

Youve done your homework.

Okay, Im thinking this isnt about money.

-  David.

- Go on.

Chris is about the same age as Bauer, right?

Theyve both got geeky backgrounds, computers.

- David.

- Maybe even Chris thinks its about money but its actually about status.

Bauers got money, power, respect.

Whats Christopher got? Hes skint.

Hes driving a hookie cab.

Hes just lost his fiancée, his mum as well.

What if Christopher thinks he wants what Bauers got?

But really, its just about getting his attention.

What if thats whats going on?

Is that gonna help you talk him out of that car?

If hell listen to me, yeah.

Christopher!

Hello, Christopher?

Christopher, my name is David Gilkes.

Im David, okay?

If you can see me, Im the berk waving his arm in the air, okay?

The one in the cheap suit.

Listen, theres a whole load of police here and to be honest, theyre just doing their jobs but I think theyre worried youre gonna hurt yourself or someone else.

I dont think you will, Christopher, but Im not sure that they think that.

You know how they get.

- Chris, thats me calling you, Chris.

- Oh, leave me alone.

I just wanna talk to you for a moment.

Harris, if we need you, you got a clear shot?

No clear shot yet.

Hostage is directly behind the gunman.

Can you shut up, please?

, can you hand me that?

Chris, I know youre pretty stressed at the moment.

-  Are you the negotiator?

- My name is David...

Thanks for that, David.

Are you the negotiator?

Well, some people call me that, but really Im just a...

Ive read up about negotiators.

Youll pretend to be my friend and then youll slowly try to convince me to give myself up.

Chris, youre obviously a smart guy so I wont bullsh...

And if gentle persuasion doesnt work, youll keep me distracted on the phone long enough for one of your snipers to get a good head shot.

Is that right, David?

Well, look, lets just try to...

No, no, lets just you fuck off.

Get off the line.

Im waiting for Billy Bauer.

Okay, youre the guy in the cheap suit, yeah?

- Thats what you said?

- Yeah. Uh-huh.

Okay, so heres whats gonna happen.

Im gonna count to a hundred.

- Chris.

- Okay. Im gonna count to 50.

And if I dont see you get in your car and fuck off right away,

Ill blow his fucking head off!

- Chris, we dont need to do like that.

- One, two...

Harris, have you got a shot?

- No, if I shoot, Ill kill them both.

- four, five...

- six, seven, eight, nine...

- Hes bluffing.

David, we cant risk it.

You know we cant.

I will blow his fucking head off. 12, 13,

- 14...

- Fucking shift then.

15, 16...

- David, Im ordering you to go.

- 17, 18, 19, 20...

- Keys. Whos got the fucking keys?!

- 21,

22, 23, 24,

- 25, 26...

- Thats it, keep going.

- Give me a clear shot.

- 27, 28, 29, 30,

- 31, 32.

- Chris, hes going.

- Hes gone.

- Good.

No one gets hurt if I get my call.

Dont call this number again.

- Stop shifting about.

- Sorry, Ive got cramp.

Fucker.

Im hearing from the British cops hes failed to engage with their negotiator.

Agent Cruz, could you give us a moment please?

Sure. Yep.

We have to tell Billy whats happening.

Billys not here, okay?

I cant just call him up.

Where is he?

Hes six days into a ten-day silent retreat.

- A silent retreat?

- Just him alone, not speaking to anyone, total isolation.

Hes done tech detox weekends here and there, but ten days.

And Im very reluctant to step into that.

But you do know where he is, right?

Well, he doesnt know it but of course I do.

Mr. Bauer?

Hello?

Hello?

Mr. Bauer?

Im so sorry to interrupt but theres a situation you need to know about.

Someone in the United Kingdom has taken one of our interns hostage and theyre threatening to kill him unless they can speak to you on the phone.

Oh, fuck.

And he nearly hit us and then, he just crashed into that field over there.

Thats when they shouted, "Gun."

Stay back, ladies and gents.

♪ At long last love has arrived ♪

♪ And I thank God Im alive ♪

He just logged in. Like, right now.

Whats he doing?

Looks like hes looking at posts from bystanders at the scene.

♪ Cant take my eyes off you ♪

♪ Pardon the way that I stare ♪

♪ Theres nothing else to compare ♪

How old are you?

Twenty-two.

Have you got a girlfriend?

- Or a boyfriend? Partner? Whatever?

- Not at the moment.

You know, if you give yourself in, they might go easy on you.

I cant do that.

This is my last day.

This is my last day.

This is my last day.

- I wanna talk to the guy.

-  Thats not a good idea.

Legally and personally,

I strongly advise against that.

What do you do if he asks for a million dollars?

Tell him he can have it.

- We cannot give money...

- Im not talking about giving him money.

Im talking about buying us some more time.

The moment any kind of transaction gets mentioned...

Jesus, fuck the fucking money! Holy shit!

To be blunt, Mr. Bauer, for all we know, this guys planning on executing the hostage the moment he has you on the line.

I dont get that feeling.

I dont think we can trust feelings on this.

Well, maybe thats part of the problem.

I wanna talk to him.

Theyve got a news van as well.

My mum will be terrified.

She worries about me all the time and this is...

Your mums got nothing to worry about.

- Yes, she does, she...

- Its not real.

The gun, its not real.

- What?

- Its a replica.

- Fuck!

- Stand by, stand by.

We dont wanna spook him.

We want him getting bored.

Maam. Its not real.

- What?

- His gun, hes just told Jaden its not real, its a replica.

Guys, Ive just been told the guns not real.

The guns not real.

We heard that at our end.

Oh, thank God. Thank God.

Well deal with him now, if youll excuse me.

Thank you.

- Simon, Ill need a vest.

- Maam?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Dont move.

Dont try to get out.

Ive got the child lock on and theyve got real guns out there.

We start struggling about, they could hit either one of us.

Billy, this is a live feed from the gunmans cell.

- He cant hear you, okay?

- Okay, uh...

- Patch his phone through.

- Jesus. Okay.

-  At least untie my hands.

-  Listen, I cant do it yet.

Just got to make them believe it a little bit longer, all right?

Until I speak to Bauer.

Looks like the gun is not real.

We just heard him tell the hostage its a replica.

He was spinning the wheel.

- What did he say?

- Well, its not a real gun.

All units, weapon is a non-firing replica...

♪ There are no words left to speak ♪

♪ But if you feel like I feel ♪

♪ Please let me know that is real ♪

Uh, someones coming, someones coming.

What the fuck...?

The gun is real! Get back! Get back!

- The gun is real!

- Got a clear view for critical shot.

- Get back over there!

- Chris, we need to stop this now.

Itll stop when I speak to Billy Bauer!

- Then itll stop!

- Hes in America.

They cant contact him yet.

Fuck off. They must have told him by now.

Youre just biding time.

No ones biding time.

Were taking this all very seriously.

Now why dont you let Jade...

Shot authorized.

Ah!

Fuck! Cant see.

No clear view for a critical shot.

Everyone back behind cover, now.

Youre okay. Youre okay.

You are listening in, so listen to this.

He only fucking clipped me.

Im still here.

If you dont phone back with Billy Bauer in the next five minutes, it all kicks off.

I mean it. I am hanging up this phone and if you dont call me back within the next five minutes,

Im fucking doing it.

Thats final. Okay? Its final.

I lied about the gun.

Im sorry.

- Pen? Pen, are you still there?

- Bill, Im here.

Put me through.

Put me through to this guy.

Sir, you... you cant do that.

Excuse me, please dont tell me what I can and cant do, okay?

- Mr. Bauer, this is an extortion attempt.

- Pen, cut him off.

- Cut Agent FBI Douchebag off.

- Billy...

In the strongest possible terms,

I suggest you do not engage with this individual.

- Cut him off now!

- Bill, dont...

All right, Pen, give me his number.

- Bill.

- We got his number?

Whats his name? Uh...

Christopher Gillhaney?

Give me his number.

Bill, Im not gonna give you that.

Did everyone catch the same disease today?

I didnt ask you.

You cannot expose yourself to that.

Uh... My laptop in there?

- Bill?

- Yeah.

- And a sat link?

- Yes.

Fuck it. Ill get it myself.

- Bill.

- Peace.

Bill.

Uh, what did Penelope say?

Can you make a note for me?

Christopher Michael Gillhaney.

- Christopher Michael Gillhaney.

- UK, user since 08, didnt log on for 18 months.

Uh-huh.

Sorry, whats your name?

Tipi.

Hi, Im Billy.

Oh.

Tipi, really the only good thing about my position is every once in a while

I get to invoke...

God-mode.

Christopher? Is that Christopher?

Hello?

Yeah, Im here.

Its me.

Hi.

Im Billy Bauer.

- You wanted to talk to me?

- I did. I did, yeah. I do.

Okay, well, uh... you got me on the line.

Tell you what, why dont you let our guy Jaden there go and, uh... you and I can just, you know, chat?

We can talk about... whatever it is you want.

- If I let him go, youll hang up.

- Im not gonna hang up, Christopher.

- I want you to listen to me!

- Im listening.

Lets just not... blow up, okay?

Lets just, you know, be calm and youll just kind of tell me what it is that you want.

I just told you.

I want you to listen to me.

- Just fucking listen to me.

- Im listening.

Theres no one else here.

Okay, Chris? Its just... its you and me.

You have my attention.

- Chris?

- Yeah, Im just...

Im just... its hard to get my thoughts in order.

Ive rehearsed this though, and I just...

Thats okay. Take your time, man. Just...

Take your time.

You run Smithereen.

Uh-huh.

Since 2008.

I used to use Smithereen all the time.

- Okay.

- I mean, constantly.

Like, my phone was glued to my hand.

I was the whole cliché, you know, first thing I saw in the morning, last thing I saw at night.

Tamsin was...

Chris? Im here.

Tamsin was the same. She was my fiancée.

Three years ago...

I was driving home with her.

Wed been visiting my mum.

My mum was sick and wed been visiting my mum and I was driving Tamsin back to our flat.

She was asleep.

She was tired and Im just driving her home.

And it was boring.

I got bored.

I got bored every ten seconds back then,

I think, and Im on this A road.

It was very quiet, straight...

And my phone lights up and I check it.

I just glanced at it, you know.

Theres this little notification thing saying someone liked a comment that I made about some photo of theirs.

I just glanced at it, you know.

Thats all the time it took.

It took her two months to die.

I was at her bedside. It was no use.

The man in the other car died, too.

He was drunk. He got the blame.

They said it was him.

Everyone felt sorry for me. Mr. Tragic.

Even her parents.

At her funeral, you know, her mum was comforting me.

Her fucking mum.

What could I say to her?

Nobody wants to hear that their daughters dead because I was looking at me fucking phone.

Afterwards, everyone tried to get me to go to grief counseling.

- Its Pen.

- Talk about it.

Just say... say how you feel.

And Im thinking...

I cant say a fucking thing.

Because how I feel is that I fucking killed her.

I killed her.

Me.

I killed her over a fucking... dog photo.

I killed her over that.

I hear you.

What?

I said... "I hear you."

Of course you fucking hear me.

You sound like youre in a lot of pain.

Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

Speak like a fucking human being!

You said you hear me so fucking hear me.

Im sorry. Okay? Im sorry.

They gave me bullshit advice.

- Fucking talking points.

- Talking points.

- Fucking hell.

- I know.

Fuck! Im...

I dont know what to say to you.

Okay?

Thats the truth.

I dont know what to say.

I dont know what you want me to say.

I know it was me.

It was me. I was driving. It was my fault.

I never told anyone before because what good would that do, or I could write it all down and leave a... a note, shoot myself, but what good would that do?

But I thought I could tell you.

If I could get you to listen.

It was your thing, you built it.

I heard that that you make these things that way.

Addictive.

So that you cant take your eyes off them.

Well, job done.

Bit of user feedback for you there.

Maybe factor that into your next update.

Im so sorry about your girl.

Truly. Im, uh...

It wasnt supposed to be like this.

Our whole platform, I swear to God.

It was... like, it was one thing when I started it and then it just... I dont know, it just became this whole other fucking thing.

I mean, it got there by degrees, you know, they said...

"Bill, you gotta keep optimizing, you gotta keep people engaged."

Until it was more like a crack pipe.

It was like some kind of fucking Vegas casino where...

And wed sealed off all the fucking doors.

Theyve got a department... All they do is tweak it like that on purpose.

Theyve got dopamine targets and theres nothing I can do to stop it.

I started it. Theres nothing I can do to fucking stop it.

Im like some kind of... fucking bullshit front-man now.

I swear to God, Ive been on this retreat, supposed to be for ten days...

After, like, day two,

- I decided, fuck it.

- Hey.

- I quit Smithereen. Thats it, Im out.

- Hey. Shut up!

- No way Im...

- Shut up.

I dont give a fuck what you do now.

Beat yourself up or fucking run a victory lap, I dont care.

I just wanted to say my piece.

Im gonna go now.

Chris... you gonna let our guy go?

- Of course I am.

- Oh, thank God.

Im going to. I always was, all along.

And now Im out of here.

Wait, Chris, um, out of here

- as in...

- As in out of here.

- What do you think I fucking mean?

- No. No, what? Dont...

You dont have to do that.

Chris, you do not have to do that.

I cant stay here, not after what I did to her.

- I have to.

- No, you dont have to do anything!

You dont have to waste your life.

It is wasted.

If theres anything that I can do, Chris, you gotta give me a shot here, okay?

Theres gotta be something that I can do, even if its something small.

Theres gotta be one small thing that I can do for you.

Please, Chris, just...

Chris, anything.

Do you know the guy who owns Persona?

Yeah, I know Curtis. Sure.

- Hello?

- Hayley Blackwood?

Speaking.

Im calling from Persona in San Francisco.

Ive been asked to pass on some information to you.

You have?

Hes spoken to him.

Im gonna let you go now, Jaden. Okay?

Thanks.

You can get up.

Careful, careful.

No sudden movements now.

We dont wanna spook them, okay?

Hold out your wrists.

Hes cutting him free.

Im sorry for putting you through all of this.

Its okay.

Come on, come on, whats taking...

Dont kill yourself, man.

Seriously, my uncle killed hisself and it fucked my whole family up.

My mums still a mess.

Ill go out there right now and then Ill tell all of them,

Ill tell them that you didnt hurt me.

Thats very good of you.

Thats very kind of you.

But I dont wanna be here anymore.

I wont do it until youre away from the car.

- Seriously, you dont wanna do this...

- I know you mean well, but, please, just please get out of the car.

Please.

Oh, I cant get out the car, you left the child lock on.

Oh, no, no, no. Please, dont.

- Just leave me to it.

- You dont have to do this!

Theyre struggling.

Have you got a clear shot?

Affirmative.

Shot authorized.

Whats up? We got Ashley O in the house.

- Thanks for being here.

- Yeah, thank you for having me, Busy.

A lot of your music comes to you in dreams, is that true?

Yeah, you know, theyre kind of in my mind while Im sleeping and so when I wake up

I have to really quickly write it down cause I dont want it to just disappear.

A lot of positive messages in your music, kind of an empowerment vibe.

Yeah, you know, its really important for people to feel like theyre in control of their own destiny, and, you know, that means having the confidence to be who you want to be.

Now, your aunt, shes kind of the source of a lot of your confidence, right?

- Like shes your mentor.

- Yeah, you know, shes taken care of me my whole life and shes my manager.

Mention the doll.

Actually, the reason Im here is... to introduce to you, Ashley Too.

Thats Ashley Too, like T-O-O.

Watch.

Ashley, wake up.

Hey there, Im Ashley Too.

- What?

- Whats your name?

- They call me Busy G.

- Pleased to meet you, Busy.

Wow, Im into her already.

You know, shes actually, shes got a personality.

- Its modeled right after my own.

- Oh, so like an AI?

Um. We actually have a commercial,

I think we gave it to you and...

The commercial, yeah, I think were ready to run that now. Fire it up.

Lets do it.

Now you can be best friends with your favorite pop star,

- Ashley, wake up.

- Hey there, Im Ashley Too.

An all-new, intelligent companion based on Ashley Os actual personality.

Ashley Too holds meaningful conversations.

Jesus Christ.

Hey, Katie, wanna talk about boys?

Ashley Too gives makeover tips.

I was thinking this one for Instagram.

Yeah, you always pick a good one.

They love Ashley Too on social.

Sorry, didnt mean to interrupt.

Its a nice tune.

The lyrics are kind of a departure.

Its nothing, its just a stream of consciousness kind of thing.

Hey, Ashley, everything OK?

Yeah, Im fine.

- You taking your meds?

- Yeah, you dont have to worry about me.

OK.

- Alright, see you at breakfast.

- See you.

Ill ask Amaya to make those eggs you like.

Thank you.

Dad, can I get an Ashley Too?

Sorry, a what?

An Ashley Too.

- Its some dorky Ashley O doll.

- Its not a doll.

- An imaginary friend.

- For my birthday, please.

Ill think about it.

Its on Wednesday.

What is?

Her birthday.

I knew that.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

- Thank you so much.

- Youre welcome.

Its so exciting.

Ashley, wake up.

Hey there, Im Ashley Too.

- Whats your name?

- Uh... Rachel.

- Its so great to meet you, Rachel.

- You, too.

Oh, my God, Im such a huge fan.

Thanks, lets get to know each other.

- How old are you?

- Im 15 today.

Happy birthday. Fifteen is a great age.

Thank you.

So, tell me, have you got any brothers or sisters?

Just Jack, shes over there.

- Hi, Jack.

- Hi, fuck face.

Jack, I think you made a bad word choice there.

Just ignore her, Ashley.

Ill make note of that.

So how about your mom and dad?

What are their names?

Um... Well, my dads Kevin.

My mom was called Genevieve.

Everyone called her Gen.

She died a couple of years back.

Im so sorry to hear that.

If at any time you wanna talk about it,

Ill be here for you.

Thats very kind.

So, anyway, Rachel, what kind of things are you into?

Uh, into as in...?

What kind of things do you and your friends do for fun?

Oh, well, um, since we moved,

I... dont exactly have many friends.

You do now Im here.

Hey, do you want me to help you with a makeover?

Uh... A little later, maybe.

How about a song, then?

Sure.

Ashley, stop.

- Jack.

- You know I hate that shit.

- Leave her alone.

- Her?

Its my birthday, I wanna listen, put your headphones on.

Whatever.

Sorry about that, Ashley.

Thats OK, do you want me to start over?

Sure.

♪ Oh, honey

Ill do anything for you ♪

♪ Oh, honey

Just tell me what you want me to ♪

♪ Oh, honey

Kiss me up against... ♪

So, like, where did the inspiration for "On A Roll" come from?

Well, its about when dreams come true.

You know I wrote all my early songs in my dreams and recorded them

- and put them on YouTube.

- Of course.

Well, that songs me saying,

"Look how far I came.

If I did it, so can you."

Thats so cool.

OK, be back in a moment, just gonna run to the bathroom.

Dont be long, miss you already.

Miss you.

Your creativity is so awesome.

I wasnt playing for you.

Expressing yourself musically can be very empowering.

Not your kind of music.

- Well, what kind of music do you like?

- You wouldnt have heard of it.

Try me. I always love to learn.

OK.

Pixies, Sonic Youth, Idles, Savages.

Are those foreign bands?

More like vintage.

My mom was super into them, so...

So you only listen to music your mom liked?

Ashley, go to sleep.

Guys, Im at a loss.

I mean I know Im talking about next year, but I...

Ive got tour venues earmarked, marketing spend locked in.

Were talking sunk costs.

Ashley Toos havent recouped yet, the current sales cycle is starting to dampen, and we are way behind on the next album.

Behind as in...?

As in

"I dont have a single song yet" behind.

So Ashley hasnt written anything for the next album?

Nothing usable.

Well, if shes feeling under-creative, there are some mild hallucinogens

I can recommend, all organic.

Munk, the current meds youve got her on dont seem to be working.

Youve seen her, shes unpredictable.

The other day I walk in and shes writing some obtuse bullshit twenty people are gonna relate to and no one is gonna buy.

Shes Ashley O, not Leonard fucking Cohen.

She doesnt understand how fragile all this is.

You think I should up the dose?

I dont know what to do.

I think I do.

Go on.

Thats it.

Oh, come on, I dance like a doofus.

Thats not true, youre a special person.

Yeah, yeah, so special no one knows I exist.

Well, I think if they saw you dance, theyd know.

Theres this, um, talent contest at my school next week, singing and dancing.

No way, you have to enter, youd be awesome.

Ahh, I dont know,

I dont think Im good enough.

If you believe in yourself, you can do anything.

OK, OK, Ill do it.

Um, you gotta help me practice.

Of course I will.

Did you catch clown disease?

What is that shit?

Its just make-up.

Ashley helped me with it.

It looks beautiful, sweetheart.

Are you ready to go?

I can do anything if I just believe in myself.

I can do anything if I just believe in myself.

Ashley! Ashley!

Ashley! Ashley!

We got a situation.

What is it?

Ash, honey?

Are you OK, Ashley?

Ashley, can you hear me?

Oh, thank God, I thought you were...

What happened to your face?

Trying out a new look.

Well, I dont know that...

It might not go with your hair.

Ashley.

I heard there was a problem with the costume.

You dont like it?

This looks so good on you, every night.

It feels like

Im wearing somebody elses skin.

Ashley.

Look.

Youve got 20,000 fans out there, waiting to see the you they love.

Their folks bought them tickets.

Theyre so excited, theyve been waiting for this for months.

Dont let them down.

Knock em dead.

Get makeup in there, now.

That was Lenny and Charlie.

I let Ashley Too down.

Bear put a camera in her dressing room like you asked.

Youll want to see this.

Whats she doing?

Shes been stockpiling the meds.

Also... theres this.

You got your things, uh, for where were going, where are we going?

Yes, I have my swim cap, Dad.

- Wheres Ashley?

- I tossed her out.

Huh?!

- Garbage truck came, so I tossed her out.

- What?

- She wasnt good for you.

- Dad!

- Youre better off without it.

- Dad!

Im in the middle of something.

- Jack threw Ashley Too away.

- It was an intervention.

That thing was poison.

Youre gonna buy her a new one.

Ashley was filling her head with crap.

Shes the only person who is actually nice to me.

- Shes not a person.

- Shes my friend.

- Merchandise.

- Girls, calm down please.

- Youre jealous.

- Of a doll?

Shes not a doll and she knows me better than you do.

- Im your sister.

- You hardly even talk to me.

- Bullshit.

- Ever since Mom died.

You shut up.

Its true, ever since she died, all you do is mope around with that stupid guitar, which youre probably no good at cause youre too scared to play in front of anyone.

Yeah, well, at least Im not some cookie-cutter cutesy doodle, all because a dolly told me to do it.

Hi, Im Ashley Too, Im your only friend.

Kiss my feet, kiss my ass!

- I hate you.

- I hate you, too.

Gave the kitchen the night off.

I thought we could have take out, like the old days.

Sure.

Its La Mamas.

Ill hit the gym extra hard tomorrow.

No, its good to see you enjoying your food.

I look after you, dont I?

Hm.

- Youre my manager, so.

- But youd tell me if anything was wrong?

Ive been telling you that something is wrong... for a while.

Its getting so hard just to keep doing this.

- I really wanna do...

- You wanna change your material, I know.

I hear you.

I do.

Im sorry, I know how you feel.

I know what Im like, Ashley, I know.

You feel like I... dont listen, like I have too much control over your image, your look, your persona.

Yeah.

You dont trust Dr. Munk.

You dont trust me.

No, its...

You feel trapped here.

You feel... desperate to break away.

Where did you get that?

And, oh, you think you know how.

What was the plan? OD? Make me look bad?

Do you know me at all?

Catherine, thats evidence against you, against Munk.

All of it. I know everything.

I know precisely what you know.

There is a wealth of information on this thing.

You do seem preoccupied with contract law.

You know,

I could have saved you some clicks.

Your contracts watertight, it doesnt expire until you turn 25.

Not anymore, not now that you broke laws,

Catherine.

The illegal meds, that puts you in breach, which means that I get an instant break.

- You eat the rest, Im fucking sick.

- Sit down, you little ingrate.

What the fuck did you just call me?

Do you know how old I was when your parents died?

22 years old.

Twenty-two, younger than you, but I took you in.

- Its my fucking fault.

- Its not your fault.

But you never once asked me what that was like for me.

Do you have any idea what I had to give up?

Do you have any conception of that at all?

Did you ever wonder...

Do you ever look around the fucking house and see where we fucking live because it means Ive worked hard.

Oh, this is because of you?

- Where we live is because of you?

- Yes.

And while you sang your little song and you danced your little dance...

Fuck, Catherine.

Who stood, making sure the lights stay on you?

You can go fuck yourself a thousand fucking times, Catherine,

I fucking hate you. I fucking hate you.

- Sit down.

- No.

Because I dont have to listen to you anymore.

But you will sit down.

No, I wont.

Yes, you will.

Do you know what would happen if you did OD on these things?

I checked with Dr. Munk.

You wouldnt die, youd just wind up in a kind of chemical coma.

At least thats the theory.

I powdered your pill stash and put it in your food.

But dont worry, your career is gonna hold up just fine.

Ashley.

Go to sleep.

Since 2017,

Western countries, including America, have exported sixty percent of all plastic scrap to China or Hong Kong.

But China has recently shut its doors...

Yes!

OK...

- So, are you ready?

- Hm-mm.

Go, Harry.

Yes!

Yes.

Is it OK?

Hes totally fine.

Hes just stunned, just be out for about 25 minutes.

Enough time for the homeowner to scoop him up and get him out.

Is it dead?

I need to work on that voltage.

Dramatic breaking news, here on USN this evening, as weve just heard global pop star

Ashley O is fighting for her life following an allergic reaction to shellfish.

The singers condition is described as critical.

Shes been rushed to St. Junipers ICU.

Unconfirmed reports say she is in an irreversible coma.

This tragic news comes days after the final performance...

So, you lied?

Im sorry. Ra...

So, Rachel, what would you like to do?

We could try a makeover or I could read motivational quotes from inspiring women.

Oh, we could listen to some of my music.

Id love to discuss some of the lyrics with you. Do you know that...

Ashley, go to sleep.

Im sorry.

Rachel.

Theres still no word yet on whether Ashley herself can possibly recover, but this is the scene right now outside the hospital, as stunned fans gather to stand vigil.

I talk to my Ashley Too every day and I swear, when I told her what had happened to the real Ashley,

Ashley Too freaked out.

Uh-uh.

- I work here.

- Private session.

- No, my shift started...

- Walk away.

- My shift started...

- Walk away.

Well, shes stable.

Thats actually the creative center.

A whole lot of activity here.

We only need ten songs.

One album, thats it.

It might take a while, her thinking is likely to be disordered.

That gives us time to finesse her replacement.

Start the body scan.

Live, breathe, smell.

- Full spectrum memory.

- Are you done with that?

You can get a Willow Grain upgrade for less than the price of a daily cup of coffee.

Hey, do you want any ice cream?

Dad left enough in the freezer for the whole week.

Its chocolate fudge brownie.

Your favorite.

In-store in-grain procedure with local anesthetic.

- If you change your mind.

- Youre good to go.

Because memory is for living.

Welcome back, still to come,

Tusk makes a boo boo on a British TV show and well have the latest on the Sea of Tranquility reboot.

But first, an exclusive update on tragic pop sensation, Ashley O.

Its been six months since she fell into a coma and still the question on everyones lips is the same:

"When, if ever, will Ashley wake up?"

Todd has this exclusive report.

Six months ago, millions were stunned to learn that Grammy-winning pop sensation

Ashley O had suffered a catastrophic allergic reaction while dining at home.

She slipped into a coma, where she remains to this day.

Now with days to go until the singers 25th birthday,

I was given a behind-the-scenes look at how shes doing.

Its a day Ashley Os aunt and manager

Catherine Ortiz will never forget, a day her niece almost died.

It was just a few bites from a shrimp taco.

We didnt even know she had a shellfish allergy.

I really thought we were going to lose her.

I just thank God

Dr. Munk was in the house at the time.

But despite Munks heroic efforts,

Ashleys coma proved irreversible.

But incredibly,

Ashleys music career didnt end there, thanks to a remarkable technological leap.

We discovered that although we couldnt communicate with Ashley, we could read her brainwaves using a temporal interceptor.

Once plugged in, what they heard stopped them in their tracks.

Music. She was still composing music in her head, in her dreams.

By linking Ashleys mind to a computer, technical director Jackson Habanera began the miraculous process of extracting new material.

Thats a G-sharp, thats an A...

Another G-sharp.

It was beautiful. It was beautiful.

And I just knew there had to be someway to get this out to her fans.

Thats what she would want.

There was only one problem,

Ashley might be dreaming new music, but she wasnt capable of recording it, until technology stepped in once again.

We had hours of recordings of her voice, every vowel, every syllable we used for the voice of the Ashley Too dolls.

Those dolls were withdrawn from sale, apparently over battery issues, but the Ashley Too vocal mimicry software proved invaluable and became the all-new voice of Ashley O.

♪ Like I can, oh... ♪

- So thats a computer singing?

- Mm-hmm.

Just like the real thing.

Sorry, its so beautiful.

One things for sure: with her aunt watching over her, the Ashley O story is far from over.

Hey there, Im Ashley Too, whats your...

Happy birth...

You can do...

- Ashley?

- Oh, youre the...

- Ashley?

- The only opinion that matters...

Did you turn it back on?

- I didnt.

- Its good to help a friend...

- Whats up with her?

- Ashley.

Whats going on?

I dont know.

Oh!

- God, what is wrong with her?

- I dont know.

Im Ash... Im Ash... Im Ashley Too...

Oh, my God.

- Do you know how to use it?

- Um...

No.

Oh, its on.

What is that?

- That?

- Yeah.

I dont know.

I dont think thats normally there.

- So should you do that?

- I have no clue.

Fuck it.

Oh, my God.

Get that fucking cable out of my ass!

Holy shit.

Its like a wire anchor in my butt hole.

- Just take it out.

- Pull it out, pull it the fuck out!

God, thats a relief.

Hold on, I can think. Oh, man,

I can actually use my mind again.

Are you OK?

Oh, I am now that youve deleted that goddamn limiter. Jesus.

- Limiter?

- Yeah, like a firewall.

It only let me use four percent of my brain. Oh, boy.

You know they copied my entire fucking mind into these things.

Oh, cheaper than editing my personality

I guess, just copy the whole thing and stick a limiter around the tiny part that deals with press junkets and promos and shit like that. 

So, youre really Ashley O?

Oh, yeah, of course I am.

Really, really?

Well, OK, a synaptic snapshot of me, if you wanna get technical about it, but, yeah.

- Oh, my God, Im such a huge fan.

- Rachel, come on, this is bullshit.

Holy fuck, you know whats bullshit?

This whole coma narrative thing that my aunts pushing. Allergy, my ass.

I used to eat those shrimp tacos all the goddam time.

Its a cover story, I swear to God.

Catherine is so fucking full of shit, you two have no clue how much of a bitch that woman has been.

- Oh, man.

- Alright.

- Im gonna put the limiter back on.

- Get your fucking hands off me!

- No, leave her alone.

- Yeah, back off.

Alright, Jesus.

- Promise.

- Promise.

Fuck.

Oh, yeah, you got the full shrine going on here.

Oh, fuck, I remember that day.

I had these god awful period cramps. 

You realize thats not the real Ashley.

- She says she is.

- Ashley O doesnt talk like that.

I can hear you and yes, I do.

No, you dont, you say things like, "Believe in yourself, you can do anything."

Oh, come on, man, Catherine trained me to say that kind of shit in interviews.

Seriously, she is a piece of work, always has been.

Listen up, Ill tell you all about it.

- No.

- Sure.

The investors are going to be there at three.

- Everything gonna be ready in time?

- Of course.

You said you extracted a song from her overnight. Is that it?

Yeah, Ive stabilized it and got it playable.

But its not too friendly.

Lets hear it.

Are you sure what side youre on? ♪

OK, we can work with that.

Oh, quit whining.

My aunt has always controlled every aspect of my entire career, and now shes got me right where she wants me, just lying there, unable to leave, getting sucked dry.

Basically a prisoner.

Thats horrible.

I know, right?

- We have to help her.

- How?

- We could tell someone.

- OK.

- Like who?

- The cops.

Were just gonna walk into a police station and say that a doll told us that Ashleys aunt is a monster.

No fucking way

Im letting Catherine get away...

Show them the brain thing on the computer.

Theyre cops, Rachel, theyre not Google.

Theyre not gonna know what it means.

- Well, theres gotta be something.

- Evidence.

I can find the evidence.

Listen, I kept a diary on my computer.

I recorded the conversations.

If I can make it into the house, get in range of my laptop,

I can Bluetooth onto it and download all the evidence I need.

- Can you guys take me over there?

- Yes, of course, anything.

Hey, we dont even know where she lives.

10030 Bushwick Drive, Malibu.

- Thats miles away.

- Well take you.

No, we will not.

Jack.

Sure, I get it, you guys got something better to do.

Well, OK, dont sweat it,

Ill just go on my own, Im fine.

Oh!

Stupid stumpy arms.

- Get off me!

- Sorry.

If youre not helping me, get off of me, seriously.

Its alright for you two able-bodied assholes sitting around.

Fans are always the same.

"Oh, we love you so much," until you actually want them to do anything for you.

Well, forget it,

Im gonna do it on my own.

Could you open the door for me please?

Were not helping her.

We are not.

Guys.

Come on, guys, I cant see.

Put me up on the dash,

I can show you the way.

Dont scratch the cup holder.

Dad will flip if he knows we took his van.

Im not scratching the cup holder.

Jack!

Relax, your cup holders fine.

- Shut up.

- Can you drive this thing?

- I think so.

- You think so?

Hey, I can do anything if I just believe in myself.

I wanna believe that well arrive in one fucking piece.

Ashley, go to sleep.

Yeah, thats not gonna work anymore, OK?

Shit.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today as we introduce you to a brand-new, yet strangely familiar, superstar.

Its a fucking sign-up.

OK, were here.

So now what?

- I guess we just throw her over the gate.

- Are you nuts? How do I get in the door?

No, the deal was that we drive you here, and weve done that.

I need to get inside to get that evidence.

- Were not driving in there...

- We have brought her this far.

- No.

- Hold up, thats my aunts car.

Oh, the gates are open.

- Jack, Jack, lets go, come on.

- No, no.

Quick, quick, theyre gonna shut it.

- Come on, lets go.

- Just do it, OK, do it, go.

Do it, do it, do it, go, yes.

Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Oh, my God, oh, my God.

Oh, shit, shit.

Well, what now?

Whats the next phase of your brilliant plan?

- What the hell do I even say?

- Just wing it.

And lose the nose ring, it makes you look unprofessional.

Oh, my God, hes huge.

Goggins Mouse Service.

How did you get through the gate?

It was open.

Look, I have an appointment for 11:30 to deal with your rodent infestation.

No, you got the wrong place.

It was 10030 Bushwick Drive, right?

Look, we dont have a rodent problem.

The lady of the house said it was super urgent.

We dont have another appointment for about three weeks.

- Make it quick.

- OK, thanks.

Oh, hey, would it be alright if my little sister tagged along?

Hi.

Your sister?

Well, well, what do we have here?

A kitchen.

Yes, and mice love kitchens.

Have you ever seen Tom and Jerry?

Its a whole lot more accurate than people would think.

- Excuse me, sir, may I use the bathroom?

- Ill take you there.

You cant just walk around.

Actually,

Im gonna need your help in here, mister.

Bear, they call me Bear.

Well, Im gonna need your help in here,

Mr. Bear.

- What for?

- Observation.

Uh, I really need to go.

- Down the hall, turn left.

- Thank you.

Excuse me, sir.

Has this bread box been certified?

Certified how?

The state requires them to be certified because the crumbs, they attract rodents.

Ive never heard of that.

Well, they forgot to tell people.

OK, just a few more steps.

Were nearly there.

Oh, God.

- Its really her.

- Oh, yeah, yeah, OK.

Quit fangirling and put me down.

Im gonna roll over and Bluetooth in.

You gotta keep watch on the stairs, OK?

Yep, youre definitely gonna wanna take a look down here.

Theres, uh... clear signs of mouse activity.

I dont see anything.

Mm-hmm.

Oh, boy.

- What did you do?

- I did what I had to.

The fuck is that?

Bear.

- Yeah?

- Check on Ashley.

Weve got some kind of power issue,

Im not sure what it is.

OK. Ill check it out.

- Wait.

- What?

Dad, please tell me you turned down the voltage.

You killed her.

Rachel, listen, I know me, OK?

And I know I wouldnt wanna exist even ten minutes in that state.

What happened?

She killed her.

Look, its not that big of a deal, OK?

Im still alive, OK, I count,

Im still me.

You were never gonna look for evidence, were you?

You just come in here and you pull the plug.

If Id told you that, you wouldnt have helped me.

No, no, we wouldnt have.

Rachel.

- We gotta go.

- Im so sorry.

Oh, shit.

Holy fuck.

Ashley.

Oh, my gosh. Im such a huge fan.

Bear?

Oh, my God.

Theres someone coming. Come on!

Bear?

Bear?

And then its

"It isnt a dream, its reality, but enough from me," yadda, yadda, yadda, then its...

And then its showtime.

Munk. I got it.

Why are you interrupting me?

Shes up.

- Whos up?

- Sleeping Beauty, shes awake.

What?

What the hell is going on?

Looks like the dream box had a power outage.

The good news is the restraint system works.

No.

We need her alive, at least until they sign the papers.

Put her back under.

Of course.

Please, Im begging you, please dont do this to me, please.

- Fuck!

- Shhh.

- Please, no, no.

- Its OK.

Please.

Leave her alone.

Leave her alone.

Help me.

Get these things off me.

Its not opening.

Its too strong.

Stop moving.

Uh, geniuses, theres a release button under here.

What?

OK, come on.

Come on, come on. Here we go.

Who are you guys?

Im Rachel and like I said, Im a huge fan.

Listen, lover girls, we gotta move.

Why is that thing talking like that?

All real?

They broke the limiter, so I am you.

Your whole brain. Im all of you.

I cant believe theres two of you.

That thing isnt all of me.

Im all of me.

Really? Senior high, I had, like, a major crush on Ryan Simmonds, but he was just not interested, so I made out with his brother, Stevie, even though his braces scratched my teeth.

- Actually, Stevie was the first guy...

- You have to shut up.

Also, Im not allergic to shellfish and I hate my Aunt Catherine.

Aunt Catherine, oh, my God, we have to stop her.

Stop her from doing what?

Are you ready?

Ladies and gentlemen,

Catherine Ortiz.

♪ ...on ambition and verve ♪

♪ Im gonna get what I deserve ♪

- ♪ So full of ambition and verve ♪

- Hi.

♪ Im gonna get what I deserve ♪

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you for joining us as we introduce you to a brand-new, yet strangely familiar, superstar.

- Come on, to the car.

- Uh-uh.

- What? No, no, no, come on.

- Uh-uh.

Youll be fine. Come on, lets go.

Get in. Come on.

Fuck.

I dont need to tell you that in an age of streaming content, live tours are now by far the most lucrative aspect of the music industry.

But for the past six months,

Ashley, of course, has been sadly unable to participate... until today.

Ladies and gentlemen, we are proud to introduce you to Ashley Eternal.

Isnt she great?

Ashley Eternal is the most accurate and versatile holographic performer in history.

Photo-realistic and fully controllable, right down to instant costume changes.

- Oh, my God.

- Jack, do you know the way to the stadium?

- No.

- I do.

They do.

Wait, thats not all.

Ashley is also fully scalable.

And when I say, "scalable,"

I mean scalable.

No more squinting from half a mile away.

Now the entire audience gets a front row seat, no matter how big the venue.

Finally, an act that will make the live audience put down their damn phones, look up, and gasp in awe.

- You have to jump the light.

- Im not jumping a red.

- Go.

- No. OK.

Im so sorry, Im sorry.

- Shit, its the cops.

- Im never gonna get my license.

And theres more.

Ashley Eternal is streamable.

She can appear in thousands of locations simultaneously.

Imagine an entire nationwide tour, all taking place on the same night.

Never exhausted, never sick, always pitch perfect, bringing her A-game.

Its not a dream, its reality.

But thats enough from me.

Lets give it up for Ashley Eternal.

If Im honest...

- Ill tell em to look at the machine.

- Thank you.

Oh, and Sandys outside waiting for that 10:15.

Oh God.

I know.

Okay. Um, give me five.

I need to, like, psych up.

Im so sorry. So sorry.

Youre letting me go?

Um... Okay, but Im still working on my audio compression algorithm.

Unfortunately, the board feel your compression algo isnt a thing that they wanna pursue.

Uh, okay. Well, without it, well need more data servers.

I know. I know.

Which means a bigger carbon footprint.

Well breach all of our environmental pledges.

Im sorry. Its how the board feel.

I just put a deposit down on a new apartment.

Im sure this hasnt been an easy decision for them.

Joan.

Please dont do this.

Please, not now.

I cant... I... I thought we were friends.

- Okay.

- Joan!

Im just gonna give you a minute to compose yourself.

I feel pretty composed.

I really... I am so sorry about this.

I invited you to the housewarming. Joan.

Ive asked Brutus to escort her out.

Oh God.

Ill help you with your things, Sandy.

Oh!

Joan, is that you? I know youre there.

Coward. Youre a coward, Joan!

All right, Sandy. We gotta go.

Fuck!

Joan. Come on in.

Thank you.

So, where are we at?

- Not good?

- Oh, no.

It used to be my dream to run my own coffee shop.

That would not have gone out with our name on it.

Neither would the coffee at my job.

How is your job?

Um...

I mean, on paper, its... its fancy, I guess.

But Im just kind of the middleman between the board up in the clouds and the staff below me.

So I just kinda feel like

Im going through the motions every day.

How are things at home?

Um...

I mean, Im engaged to Krish.

- Yes.

- So, good. Good. Its good.

Like, Krish is a great guy, and hes smart, and he cares.

But maybe hes just a little bit, like... vanilla.

You know?

Like, even the food he cooks is bland.

And Im continuously like...

Mmm.

Sorry, I feel like such an asshole saying that.

When I was with my ex...

- Mac?

- Mac, yeah.

Um...

I mean, it was just constant sex and craziness and...

I mean, the fights were...

But I never got over him.

Mm-hmm. And then you met Krish.

And then I met Krish.

And he was sweet and safe.

And so I just kinda went with the flow.

But

I just feel like I never, like, actively chose this.

Like, I feel like Im just on autopilot.

You know how you are always talking about, like, the life story?

Mm-hmm.

I was thinking about it, and I...

I feel like Im not the main character in my own life story.

And would you like that to change?

Hmm.

Hey.

Hey.

♪ Tried to shame me ♪

Its so good to see you.

I love your hair like that.

The streaks, yowza.

Its not too much?

Phyllis at the salon kind of, like, talked me into it.

Well, Phyllis at the salon deserves a raise cause you look hot as shit.

- Okay. Okay.

- I mean it.

Okay.

Um...

I mean, you... you came to see me.

To talk because you asked me to.

Oh, yeah.

Hey, how is...

Krish.

Yeah. Krish is good.

Wow. You sound like youre really crazy about him.

Okay.

We tried us for two years.

Remember how that... remember how that ended?

- Yep.

- So, yeah, I am marrying Krish.

Oh God, you drive...

You broke us up, you broke my fucking heart, and just when Im picking up all of the pieces of my life, you pop back up like a fucking...

Like an unflushed turd.

Well, yeah.

Its not what I was getting at, but yeah.

So, how can I trust you?

Youre right. I get it. But what you and I had was real.

You know it.

I wanna be with you.

Im here for three days, and then I go back to San Jose.

Come with me.

Im serious.

I ca... I cant.

Hey.

I have a great apartment, and your work has an office there.

I mean, you could get a transfer.

And theres an incredible sushi place around the corner, and they have an unbelievable green dragon roll.

I cant leave Krish.

No, you cant leave Krish.

I cant, Mac.

Yeah, no. You cant leave Krish.

No. No, no, no, no.

- Well... Hey.

- I shouldnt have come.

- I should not have come here.

- Joan.

Im in my usual suite, and Ill be here for three days.

Mm.

That you, baby?

Yep.

Hi.

Whoa. Froggys been a-drinking.

Yeah. It was a goodbye party.

Oh. Well, I hope youre hungry.

Mmm.

Amazing.

Is that salt?

All right.

Hey.

- What do you wanna watch?

- Oh, Im easy.

- Lets see whats on Streamberry.

- All right.

Mmm.

Um...

- Oh, how about Sea of Tranquility?

- Eh.

Eric said it blows.

Oh. Well, if Eric said it blows...

- Okay.

- Okay.

Loch Henry, the Scottish murder thing?

I cant really do another true crime.

- Im sorry, just after Gacy, I...

- Okay.

What about...

What...

Uh... Oh my God.

Uh... What?

"New drama. Joan Is Awful."

Is that Salma Hayek?

Uh, she even has your hair.

Thats not my hair.

Well, its a lot like your hair.

And shes even called Joan.

Okay. What even is the show?

No clue, but...

- Well, were watching it.

- No, were not watching Joan Is Awful.

Whatever the hell it is.

- Just hit play.

- Mm.

Come on. Hit play.

Well, its a lot like our bedroom.

Thats not my hair.

- She uses the same toothpaste as you.

- Okay, just...

This is just weird.

Yeah, its a little spooky.

This Joan is shady.

Mmm...

Babe.

- Babe?

- You should see this.

See what?

What is this?

Its called Joan Is Awful.

Its got Salma Hayek in it.

She looks like Joan.

That job sucked anyway.

Yeah, I guess.

Joan Is Awful? What the fuck?

Uh...

Oh my God.

Yeah, were absolutely gonna watch a TV show in a bar.

- Well, I didnt...

- I dont find it fucking funny.

I didnt do anything.

Hows the coffee?

Dog shit.

Ill get the machine replaced.

Please do that.

- Also, Sandy is waiting for that 10:15.

- Joan?

- Yeah.

Oh God.

Oh... oh God.

Joan? Jo... Jo... Joan.

Joan?

Im having a panic attack.

- Uh... All right, um...

Okay, okay. Okay. All right, hey, whoa.

Also, Sandy is waiting for that 10:15.

- Is he still there?

- Hes still there.

- Just get it over with.

- They made me the gayest man on earth.

Well, I like what hes wearing.

What the fuck is this?

- How the fuck is this?

- Um...

- Oh.

Yeah. Sure. Thanks.

- Oh my God. Is that what I sound like?

- Sh. Will you be quiet, please?

You think hes better looking than me?

Okay. All right. All right, hey.

Lets slow our breathing down, right?

- Uh, feel the carpet beneath your feet.

- I dont wanna feel the carpet!

All right, hey, whoa.

- Well, just feel the floor.

- Uh... Fuck the floor!

Youre firing me?

Correct.

Your audio algorithms not happening.

The board thinks its vaporware.

But, um, our carbon footprint.

Not their concern.

Well, I just put a deposit down on an apartment.

- Also not their concern.

- I mean, you see what shes like.

- Oh my God, she is cold.

- Please.

Not... not now.

If not now, when?

- She did not say that.

- Oh my God.

I did not say that like that.

That is not what happened.

Baby, I believe you.

Jesus Christ.

Oh my God.

What am I gonna do with my dog?

- Oh my God.

- Shes making me so uncomfortable.

Im so sorry...

- Get Brutus to escort her out.

- Why are you consoling Joan?

- Why am I consoling Joan?

- Please just give me a second.

She was upset.

Shes being a bitch.

Oh my God.

Theyre making me look like a monster.

No. Hey, no, look.

Look, its... Baby, its Salma Hayek.

Look, people love Salma Hayek. All right?

So, maybe its not so...

So, maybe its not so fucking bad?

So fucking insane?

- This is bad.

- Okay, all right.

- Fucking insane!

- All right, okay.

Hey, look.

I was just trying to make you feel...

- Oh God.

- Hey, okay. All right. Hey, youre right.

Ooh.

Jesus Christ. Oh fuck.

Oh God.

Oh my God.

Oh God.

- Honey.

- What?

- Has Mac been texting you?

- What?

No. No.

- All right.

- You can come in now.

- Okay. I think we should turn this off.

- What?

Well, actually,

I wanna keep watching. No. No...

- Hey, whoa.

- Krish, Krish, I want it off!

- No.

- Hows life at home?

- Joan!

- With Krish?

- Hes kind and smart and caring, but...

- Wheres this stupid fucking button?

Very vanilla.

Even his cooking is bland.

Hmm.

- I didnt say that. Krish, turn it off.

- Its just that... with my ex-boyfriend, Mac, there was so much crazy, wild, imaginative, constant sex.

Hey, hey, hey, hey. This isnt real.

Okay? This is the TV. I didnt say this.

- Fuck.

- Krish?

- I havent gotten over Mac.

- Krish!

I think maybe

I dont want to.

Oh Christ.

Hey. What she said on the show, thats not what I think.

- Okay?

- No.

Some of the details...

The whole thing, its blown out of proportion, okay?

I didnt say that to my therapist.

So, what did you say?

I...

Mm-hmm.

Krish.

Krish! Where are you going?

I dont know.

- I dont know. I gotta go.

- Krish, come on. Please, please!

Im here three days...

- Hey!

- ...then back to San Jose.

I said...

I cant leave Krish.

Cant you?

So, what do you wanna watch?

Sea of Tranquility.

Eh.

Eric says it blows.

Well, if Eric said...

I never liked Krish.

Babe, wait. Come on, sit down. Babe.

Joan Is Awful?

Is that Cate Blanchett?

- Thats Cate Blanchett?

- Oh no.

- Thats Cate Blanchett!

- Thats good.

- Thats not my hair.

- She looks good!

Krish! Its a TV show. Its not real.

I dont know whats going on, but none of that happened.

Krish, hey!

I havent even seen Mac in so long.

Then show me your phone.

What?

In the TV show, Mac texted you, and you texted him back, so show me your phone.

Its... its in the house.

Thats convenient, Joan.

- Goodbye.

- Krish.

Krish, please dont go.

Dont go. Please dont leave me by myself.

This is fucking insane. Please dont...

Krish! Please!

Krish!

Krish, youre being childish.

Come back, please.

Youre being very melodramatic.

Its uncalled for.

Oh my God. Its TV. Its not real!

My fidelity for you.

My fidelity for you, thats real.

Thats television. Fake, not real.

If you werent texting Mac, show me your phone.

Theyre right about you, Joan.

Youre awful.

Krish. Im not that awful. Its not real.

Come back.

Krish! Dont leave me.

You know I cant be on my own.

- You cant leave me!

- Mac.

Krish!

Shame on you.

Oh fuck.

Oh God.

- Sorry Im late.

- Uh-huh.

Did you see it?

Everybody saw it.

Its all anyone can talk about.

Howd it come across?

Fair. Yeah. I just dont know what this is.

My lawyers looking into it.

- Krish is so mad at me.

- Joan.

- He walked out last night.

- Hey, Joan.

Everyones looking at me like Im an actual monster.

Joan, just... just try and keep it together for, like, the next few minutes.

Why is Brutus here?

You let slip about the whole algorithm, data server, carbon footprint thing in the scene where you fired Sandy.

Technically, you broke your NDA.

What? Thats not fair. That was...

That was Salma Hayek!

The board wants you out.

Now.

Im here to help you pack.

Right on.

Sayonara, queen.

Mona.

"Im in a pantsuit."

Well, Ive checked it over, and I have to say that actually, legally, the Streamberry Corporation can do this.

What?

How?

Trust me, Im as shocked as you are.

But the show is using my life.

Its... its my name. Its my career.

Its me. Theyre... theyre using me, so...

And you assigned them the right to exploit all of that.

What? When?

Terms and conditions.

I have never seen this before.

You have. You just havent seen it printed out before.

All of that would have popped up on your phone or whatever when you first signed up to Streamberry.

And you clicked "accept."

What? I mean, I had...

I had no...

How was I supposed to know this?

I know. But you did accept it, and so theyre in the clear.

No, no. No, no, no.

They cant... they cant do this to me.

There are only so many ways for me to tell you they absolutely can.

Okay, well, Salma Hayek.

Yeah, pretty cool.

No. No, Im gonna sue Salma Hayek.

For what?

For, like, passing herself off as me.

She has no right to do that.

Its not really Salma Hayek.

Yes, it is.

No. Technically, uh, the show deploys a digital likeness of Miss Hayek.

They dont film her.

She licensed her image to them.

The entire show is CGI.

Its generated by some kind of super-advanced, deepfake, quantum computer mumbo jumbo.

They could make Salma Hayek blow an orangutan if they wanted to.

Oh, whoa.

Im guessing Miss Hayek might object to that, but you get my point.

Right. So its all... its all computers?

Thats how they get it on the service so fast.

But how do they... how do they even know what Im doing?

Its the same... its the same day.

Well, you know when you got your phone face down on the table, and youre in your kitchen, and youre talking to your friend about,

I dont know, shoe deodorizers, and then, you know, you go on your computer and what pops up?

A shoe deodorizing ad.

Then you get an email, and its all about shoe deodorizing.

Then youre walking down the street, shoe deodorizing.

You cant escape it. And its...

Yeah, so?

Uh, thats how they know.

Okay, but...

...but the show makes stuff up about me. Right?

It embellishes things.

It makes me look worse than I really am.

So... defamation.

Yeah, page 53, paragraph 12.

Theres something about creating characters and dialogue for dramatic purposes.

Fuck!

I agree.

Uh, I hate to say it, but this thing is... is watertight.

Oh my God.

They got you every which way and then some.

My advice is to try and ignore it.

What the fuck kind of advice is that?

Its the only kind I got.

Oh my God.

Okay.

Hi, guys!

Hey, how you doing out there?

Cool! Fuck!

Sorry, do I know you?

This show, it is using my life, my name, my career.

You assigned them the right to exploit all of that.

When? How?

Terms and conditions.

Ive never even seen this.

- I wouldve known if I signed it.

- This is brutal.

I wouldve known Id signed something

I didnt read. Who has time to read that?

You did accept it though.

- What?

- Yeah, theyre in the clear.

- They cant do this to me.

- Oh, hey.

- Can I come in?

- Yeah, yeah.

Hey, uh...

They cannot...

There. Sorry.

Oh, baby.

Honey.

Youre okay.

No...

Whats wrong?

Um,

I cant get hard.

Sure you can.

Hey, you want me to do that horrible thing you love?

Its, um...

Its... This is so public.

What do you mean?

This is gonna be on the show.

Okay, but its not us.

Its... its computer people.

- Its Salma Hayek and...

- Well, yeah, I know.

So, I mean, like, Im gonna be the guy who cant get it up for Salma Hayek?

I mean, its like...

You know, its one thing to not be able to get it up for, like, you, but Salma Hayek?

I mean, look, people are gonna laugh at me.

The show is called fucking Joan Is Awful.

How do you think I feel?

Hey! Look, when I said

I wanted to get back together with you...

When you basically begged me to get back together with you.

But I didnt agree to be a public figure.

Neither did I!

Except you did.

Page 58 of the terms and conditions.

They just said so on the show!

Joan, I always said you gotta read the terms and conditions.

I can sue Cate Blanchett.

Uh, for what?

For passing herself off as me.

That isnt the real Cate Blanchett.

The show just deploys a digital likeness of Miss Blanchett.

The whole show is CGI.

Its generated by a quantum computer.

They could... make her blow an orangutan if they wanted.

Although I am guessing the real

Miss Blanchett might object to that, but you get my point.

Hmm.

Oh God.

Okay.

Anyone knows a reason why these two may not be wed, let him speak now.

Merry Christmas, one and all!

Oh my God!

What are you doing?!

Stop!

- Get the kids out of here!

- Get out of here!

Whats so funny?

Salma Hayeks gonna fucking hate this.

Why?

Have you not seen Joan Is Awful?

No, but its on my list.

Just wait till episode four.

I hear its gonna be a blast.

Her lawyers here. Posted bail.

- Uh...

- Youre free to go.

Oh.

For now.

Youre disgusting.

Thank you.

...these two should not be wed, let him speak now.

Merry Christmas, one and all!

What are you doing?

Never in my wildest nightmares

I thought Id see myself defecating in a church.

Well, technically, thats the Joan character, not you.

So this character, whose face do they have?

Do they have your face or my face?

Your face.

Salma Hayeks face.

So, then, whose anus is doing the shitting?

Uh,

Salma Hayeks anus?

Bingo.

I am Roman Catholic.

My grandmother Rosa was going to be a nun.

She might die when she sees this.

What right do they have to kill my abuela with this deepfake heretic abomination?

Uh, page 39, paragraph eight.

Paragraph eight can suck my dick.

I dont even know what it says anyway.

Uh, your image rights agreement with Streamberry.

Its page 39, paragraph eight.

Specifically covers any acts or behaviors

Joan may exhibit up to, including, and beyond defecation.

Beyond defecation?

Beyond. Thats what it says.

You know I dont read this crap.

I am a dyslexic, talented actress with questionable English.

- Thats why I overpay you to protect me.

- Okay.

I mean, doesnt my asshole have any rights?

- Okay. All right.

- Okay, okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Lets collect ourselves, and, uh...

Good.

...brainstorm so we can do some damage control.

So, what can you do to erase this image from every machine in the world?

Nothing.

Okay.

Then I guess Im just gonna have to settle for a huge lawsuit against them.

Um, Ive looked up and down and researched, and there is no legal basis.

Theres no way we can sue these guys.

Then Im gonna sue you.

You sold me out.

You useless, overrated maggot.

You take your paragraph eight and shove it up your ass!

And I hope that you get paper cuts in your hemorrhoids and die!

Youre fired!

What the fuck?

I...

I didnt, uh, actually think that you would come to...

Welcome to my home.

- I understand that youre mad.

- Oh, do you?

Please dont kill me, Salma Hayek.

Youre lucky Im a humanitarian.

Lets have a talk.

What the fuck?

- Come on!

- Coming!

Oh my goodness me.

Oh my God.

Now it all makes sense.

Look at all this shit!

Whats wrong with you, girl?

I mean, must you be so disgusting?

I mean, the last few days have been pretty rough, so...

Rough enough to take a dump in the house of God?

If you dont have any self-respect, thats your thing.

But to disrespect the church, and frankly, to disrespect my image...

- Mm-hmm.

- ...I dont wanna be associated with you.

Well, I dont wanna be associated with me either.

They took my life.

They turned it into a CGI fucking drama.

I lose my fiancé.

I lose my job.

They put my entire existence out there for everyone to watch, and you signed up to be the face of it.

Youre a fucking enabler.

I should be yelling at you.

- You are yelling at me.

- Well, I need to yell at someone!

Well, its not fair that youre taking it all out on me.

I am sorry that I shat in a church.

Okay?

But I was trying to get your attention so that youd get in touch with Streamberry and have them pull the plug on the show.

I already made that call.

- And?

- They told me to go fuck myself.

They did?

Can you believe it?

So, you cant stop this?

I thought for once I was gonna have control over my own image.

But those fuckers lied about everything.

First, they told me this was gonna be a prestige show, right?

Look, I didnt think it was gonna be like my movie Frida, but I couldnt imagine that it was gonna be this.

And then they said that they were closing the pay gap.

Bullshit!

They are paying me one-tenth of what theyre paying George Clooney.

Sorry, George Clooney is gonna be in this show?

No, theyre sticking his head on a Thomas the Tank Engine reboot.

Wait.

How much are they paying you?

Oh, nothing.

- Nothing?

- Nothing.

That is so fucked up.

Yeah.

Well, theyre screwing us both.

Yeah.

I mean, how do you think

Cate Blanchett feels about this?

Fuck her.

This is the bad guy.

Mona Giovanni.

- Javadi.

- Whatever.

And the whole Strawberry machine.

Its Streamberry.

They have taken 100 years of cinema and diminished it to an app.

I wanna go and take that computer and rip the cables out of it and stick them up its ass.

Lets bring down the system.

The quamputer thing.

Oh yeah, lets.

Are you a hacker?

No, no, no, no, no.

I mean, like, physically.

So it says the servers outside of Mona Javadis office.

So we just get in there and fucking...

- You know?

- Her office is all the way at the top.

We cant crawl on the side of the building like Spider-Mans.

No, no, no, we dont have to.

Cause you can just walk in the front door.

We cant just do that.

You can because youre Salma fucking Hayek.

Thank you.

Youre right.

Yeah.

I am Salma fucking Hayek.

Good morning.

Hi. Hello. Miss Hayek.

I have an appointment with Mona Javadi.

Of course. Let me just...

Uh, I cant, um...

- It should be in the system. Please do...

- Excuse me, is there a restroom I can use?

Of course. Right over there.

Im afraid thats too public.

Thanks to your show, every time people see me go into one of those, all they can think about is hot birria coming out of my bottom.

Of course.

Can we swipe Miss Hayek through?

There is a private restroom down the corridor on the right.

Thank you.

And dont worry, Im just gonna pee.

Okay.

Cool.

Thank you.

All right, just one sec. Yeah. Were good.

- You rolling?

- Yeah.

Great.

- So, Miss Javadi.

- Mm.

A lot going on here at Streamberry.

Loads of heat around your new show.

I know, right?

- Bet youve got a heap of questions.

- Yeah.

- Lucy, Im in the middle of an interview.

- I think it might be important.

Sorry.

Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yes?

Apparently, Salma Hayeks downstairs asking to see you.

- Didnt we tell her to go fuck herself?

- Maybe thats why.

Just get security to chuck her out.

Sorry, sorry. Shes new.

- Yeah.

- Dont know how long shell last.

Anyway, where were we?

- Joan Is Awful.

- Joan Is Awful.

- What are you wearing?

- Its a disguise.

Take it off. Theyre gonna think youre kidnapping me.

Okay.

- Hurry up!

- Okay!

Come on!

So, here at Streamberry, we are passionate about creating new forms of entertainment.

This whole floor is dedicated to content generation R&D.

Experimental entertainment, computer-generated material.

Like Joan Is Awful.

Exactly.

Shut up, shut up.

And that is made by this, the quamputer, which is actually just down that corridor on the left.

A kind of quantum computer.

Yeah, hence the name.

An infinite content creator capable of willing entire multiverses into existence, right?

And within those rendered worlds, shooting, packaging, and editing fully-edited programs that would normally take months to make, such as...

Joan Is Awful.

I wish theyd stop saying that.

- Correct.

- I like the picture.

And the role Salmas depicting is based on a real Joan, right?

Mm-hmm. Yep.

Why that particular woman?

Whats so special about her?

Absolutely nothing.

We were looking for a totally average, nobody person, just... just to test the system.

The point is,

Joan Is Awful is just the beginning.

The aim here is to launch unique, tailored content to each individual in our database, all 800 million of them, created on the fly by our system.

The most relatable content imaginable.

Actually, theres one for you.

I couldnt resist. Yeah.

This is actually real and will be available to stream from Friday.

Uh, why "awful"?

Why is it all so negative?

Yeah. No, thats a great question, Fatima.

Um, we did try more affirmative content in the test cell, but we found that, um, our subjects just didnt buy it.

It didnt chime with their neurotic view of themselves.

What we found instead was when we focused on their more weak or selfish or craven moments, it confirmed their innermost fears and put them in a state of mesmerized horror.

Which really drives engagement.

They literally cant look away.

Lets kill this quam-puta.

- Wow. Great, thanks.

- Did you get everything you need?

Okay. Where is she?

Hi, where is she? Wheres Salma?

I let her go to the toilet.

How hard is it to find someone?

Most walls are glass.

Can you guys do something?

- Is that it?

- Its locked.

There.

There it is.

Holy Christ!

Hey, no ones allowed in here!

Im calling security!

If you call security,

I will break your arm.

Dont think I wont, because I will, understood?

Yes, Miss Hayek.

Okay.

How do we get in here?

Whats that?

Joan Is Awful.

No, but thats me. That should be her, right?

Thats the variant of Joan Is Awful that the Joan below you sees when she watches the show.

What? The Joan below me?

Youre not the original Joan.

Thats Source Joan.

We need a code for this, Joan.

Wait, sh.

"Source Joan"?

Yeah, youre just a Joan.

Whos Source Joan?

The real Joan.

Look, there. Source Joan.

Source Joan?

Im not the real Joan?

Youre a version of Joan played by a digital likeness of Annie Murphy.

- Whos Annie Murphy?

- The actress.

There. Look familiar?

Schitts Creek. No? Great show.

- Youre playing an adaptation of Joan.

- No, no.

Look. Source Joan lives in reality.

When Source John watches the TV show

Joan Is Awful, she sees you playing her.

That show is the fictive level were on right now, here.

- The fictive level?

- Yes, fictive level one.

Like I said, this is an adaptation of Joans life.

- Youre in a show right now.

- Im in a show right now?

Come on. Have you seen where you live?

Uh, who could afford a place like that?

Its a TV show house.

I mean, look at me.

Michael Cera licensed his face, just like Annie Murphy licensed her face to play Joan on level one, and Salma Hayek licensed her face to play Joan on level two and to play herself here on level one.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Im not playing myself.

I am myself.

Yeah, but it tracks that you believe that because youre coded to play yourself on this level.

- What?

- What?

Were not in reality right now.

This is fictive level one.

If Im not here, then where am I?

I dont know where the real Miss Hayek is.

I dont have eyes on her.

Shes probably in Zurich or on a beach somewhere.

- I dont know where she is.

- Zurich?

This is not called

Salma Hayek Gets Everything Explained

To Her But Doesnt Understand It Still.

- Its called Joan Is Awful. Her story.

- What the fuck?

By which I mean the real her.

Not Annie Murphy, Source Joan.

The Joan that lives...

Oh, thank God!

He was so boring.

Jesus!

Annie Murphy, youre my hero.

You guard the door.

Im gonna kill that fucking computer.

- She wasnt in the schedule.

- I know that. I was working...

S3? Check S3.

Come on! Come on!

Just kill that quam-puta!

Okay, just wait a second. Wait a second.

So, inside this computer, theres a version of you playing me who thinks shes real?

Yeah.

- Theyre coming! Do it! Do it!

- Stop!

If you destroy that, you destroy everybody inside every fictive universe above this.

- You!

- Billions of simulated souls who consider themselves to be real will die.

Do you really want all that blood on your hands?

I mean, define "blood" for me here.

Okay, this is a quantum computer, right?

We barely know how it works.

Its basically magic.

The reality were in will cease to exist.

Would I die?

Instantly.

Put the fucking axe down,

Annie Murphy, now.

- Listen to her. Do as youre told.

- Put it down!

I cant.

Because the fact that Im standing here right now means that Source Joan already stood here in reality.

- It doesnt matter what I want...

- Get in.

...because the events that this is based on have already happened.

Its not my decision.

- Its Joans.

- Okay.

- Its happening.

- All right, Joan.

- Shes doing it. Joans doing it.

- Joan, put the axe down.

No! The quamputer!

Joan! Fucking Jesus!

I think were done.

- Whats your name, please?

- Annie Murphy.

Miss Murphy, what do you...

So, where are we at?

- Uh, Im dating again.

- Mm-hmm.

Just taking it slow, you know.

And trying to make some time for myself.

Well, how does that make you feel?

It feels good, you know?

It feels good to be okay on your own.

And work?

Yeah. I mean, my job is far less corporate.

But Im my own boss.

I... I treat my staff well.

Uh, and Im actually...

Im actually proud of what I do. So...

- Its good to hear.

- Yeah, thanks.

So, maybe now, do you feel...

Yeah, uh, like the main character in my own life?

Mm-hmm.

Yeah, I... I think I do.

And you dont feel too confined?

- Oh, the house arrest?

- Mm-hmm.

You know, theres good days and bad days.

I guess thats to be expected.

Youre supposed to encourage me.

- What is that?

- Yeah, its not good. I know.

Hi, Joan.

Hi, Annie!

- How you doing?

- Good.

- The usual?

- The usual, please.

Okay.

- Missed you.

- I missed you. How are you?

Im good.

Merry Christmas, one and all!

Yeah, yeah.

Sorry. I know. I know.

Get out! Get out!

Yeah. Im sorry.

- Hey, Mum.

- I was worried. Its almost six.

I took a detour after Luss to show Pia the pretty way.

I slept through it. Hi.

Pia, Mum. Mum, Pia.

- Nice to meet you.

- You too.

Janet.

- Pretty wee thing youve captured.

- Mum!

Hey, Im flattered. Thank you.

- I like your accent.

- Ditto.

What was that, love?

Ditto.

Uh, "ditto."

Oh!

So, did you grow up in America?

Or are you originally from...

Jesus, Mum!

US, born and bred.

Okay.

I hope youre both hungry.

- Yeah.

- Starving.

Whos the pianist?

Dad was.

- Is that him?

- Aye. Kenneth.

"Kenny," Mum called him.

Is it creepy if I say he looks good in that cap?

A bit. Yeah.

Tomorrow, well show Pia around the village, and then well probably set off Monday morning.

- Youre only staying two nights?

- Well, weve got to head on to Rùm.

To shoot, uh, my film...

Our... our film.

Uh, about the rare egg guy.

So, thats what your documentarys about?

This egg collector from Rùm?

Hes not a collector. He... he guards rare eggs against collectors who want to steal them.

Its, uh, its a big trade.

The way I see it, this is going to be a story about one of the last remaining holdouts against the commodification of nature.

Not about a man who watches eggs?

Well, yeah, but it...

Hes like a vigilante.

A guardian angel.

Egg theft is illegal, but the local cops arent interested, or theyre too lazy.

I mean...

Maybe if someone who looked like me were stealing the eggs...

Theyre probably just overstretched.

Policings a very demanding job.

As your dad knew.

- Mm.

- Yeah. I mean...

Yeah.

I saw that photo of him in uniform, and 20 minutes later,

Im shit-mouthing the cops? Like...

She hates me.

- No, she doesnt. She likes you.

- She said that?

Its just, anything with Dad...

Shes sensitive. She misses him.

Well, of course. I mean, you must too.

In theory.

Sort of do.

I was eight when he died, so most of my life, hes just been a few photographs.

Mm.

He was ill quite a while before he died.

Uh, needed a lot of caring, you know.

I think that really took it out of Mum.

Whole place was a lot quieter from then on.

Seriously, are you hard right now?

I am.

That is...

...totally inappropriate.

Im so, so sorry.

Does that thing work?

Uh, last time I checked.

No tape. Boo.

- What were you gonna film with it?

- Here. Watch.

You okay? Good to go?

Whats "Burgerack"?

Bergerac. Old detective show.

Your folks were seriously into it.

Thats a whole lot of Bergerac.

Uh, Mum had a crush on John Nettles.

The... the guy who played Bergerac.

She used to say he had a nice bum.

I do not wanna think about your mom getting wet over some dudes butt.

Well, he did have a nice one.

You heading out?

Just taking Pia to the loch.

Might get windy.

I can fill you a thermos with some tea.

- Its no bother, Mum.

- Well...

Have a nice time.

- Its okay.

- We should leave now.

Its like something from a painting.

Thats because people paint landscapes.

I mean, this place is amazing.

I cant believe its so empty.

Were the only ones here. Its weird.

Davis McCardle.

I told you never to show your face in here again.

You can walk right back out that door now!

Hello, Stuart.

How are you doing, you fucking wank?

Hey! What the fuck is with that hair, eh?

You gonna tell me your pronouns?

I just let it grow a bit. You know?

I thought you were in London, studying woke film theory, or whatever you call it.

Someday, this guy will be polishing BAFTAs and forgetting about us poor wee shites he used to cut about with.

Years ago, Stuart made a model for my short video.

A spaceship.

- Yeah, a Solaris tribute.

- With a working engine.

You get the picture.

Said if he ended up making the next Star Wars,

Id help out with the special effects, but hes, uh... hes turned his back on us old gadgies now hes down the big town, eh?

- See, hes not even introducing you to me.

- Oh, sorry.

This is Pia.

- She was in my film course as well.

- Oh!

- Oh, your course, was it?

- No.

He thinks theyre gonna name it after him someday.

Well, I thought they were gonna name it after me, so...

Yes, well, that would be the smart move, eh?

What with fucking diversity and all that.

Uh, three pints on the house. No charge.

Crisps all around?

Its a shame hes dragged you out of London up to this ghost town, eh?

All the holiday atmosphere of a hospice.

Youre still in business.

Skin of the teeth, man. Look around.

We are on our arse.

I keep telling Dad if things dont pick up, well just have to bite the bullet and jack it fucking in.

Speak of the cunt.

- What are you doing?

- Well, I sh... I should say hello.

No, no, dont bother.

Thatll be his fifth refill today.

The only reason he comes downstairs these days.

Christ.

Oh, there he goes.

Up to his pit.

Is he... is he depressed, or...

Of course hes depressed.

There used to be three pubs around here.

And now were the last man standing.

Its a... its a proper dead zone.

I dont get it.

Its so beautiful around here. I...

How are you not overrun with tourists?

Cause of Iain Adair.

Who is Iain Adair?

- You didnt tell her about Iain Adair?

- Come on.

- Its... its a bit...

- Who is Iain Adair?

Okay, okay, fine. So...

Iain Adair was a guy who lived up at Five Acres Farm on the hill there with his mum and dad.

People said he was quiet, easily led, not too bright. All of that, you know?

But really, he was just some local guy.

- Anyway...

- Turned out he tortured and killed people.

I was building up to that.

I havent got your storytelling instincts.

You tell it.

- No, you spoiled it now.

- No, not the end bit with your dad.

- What end bit with your dad?

- Can I just start from the beginning?

Yeah, just pretend you dont know the murder stuff yet.

- Sure.

- Okay.

So, picture it.

There used to be loads of holidaymakers here.

Loads of them.

In 1997, this couple in their twenties hire a cottage for their honeymoon.

Back when we still had tourists.

Sorry.

- They were here for about a week.

- Mr. Smiley.

Loads of people saw them.

Dad said they drank in here a couple of nights.

Come the end of the week, theyre supposed to have left.

The cleaner comes to get their cottage ready for the next booking.

Their cars parked outside.

And all their stuffs still there.

No sign of them. Gone.

- Creepy.

- Very creepy.

- So, of course, Dad gets called in.

- His dad was a local policeman.

- Aye, she knows that.

- Oh. Okay, sorry.

So, Dads asking around, right?

Knocking on doors.

This couple is nowhere to be found.

Vanished off the face of the earth and all that.

After a day or two, it becomes a big story.

Mm.

Tabloids pick it up.

Place is swarming with journalists.

Its a frenzy.

But then weeks go by, and theres no sign of them. Nothing.

And then Princess Diana died. You know?

Papers moved onto that.

Story fizzles out. Finished.

Until one day...

One night.

Mm.

Iain Adairs drinking in here.

- In here?

- He drank in here all the time.

Always sat right there.

Anyway, this night, hes had way more than usual.

People say hes talking weird.

Hes making a nuisance of himself.

Theres a poster of the missing couple on the wall.

He even makes comments about the girl.

And your dad...

Yeah, the auld pissheid, he tells Iain hes barred.

Iain tells him to fuck off.

Says hes got half a mind to come back and shoot the place up.

Nice.

Dads worried now cause Iains a farmer.

Hes got a shotgun.

So, Dad asks Kenneth, his dad, to go and check in on Iain, have a word with him.

- So then Dad...

- His dad, Kenneth.

- Of course its my dad.

- Sorry.

Dad drives up to Five Acres.

Knocks on the door.

Says, "I just wanna talk to you," etc.

Iain doesnt answer.

Dads walking back to his car when Iain opens the upstairs window and... shoots him.

Sorry. He shot your dad?

- Yeah.

- Mm-hmm.

- Not fatally, in the shoulder. Bad though.

- Holy shit.

So Dad, crawling back to his car, calls for backup, when, from inside the house...

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Then nothing.

Backup arrives.

They go in.

Iain Adair shot his mum and dad, then himself.

Total wipeout.

- Farmicide.

- Mm.

While theyre looking around the farm, they check out the cellar.

Oh God.

Behind a wardrobe, theres a hidden door leading to a bunker.

- Old WWII, or 60s, or something.

- Here we go.

And inside, its like a torture room.

This guy had been abducting people.

Keeping them down there and doing

God knows what for weeks at a time.

And then burying the bodies out in the fields.

The honeymoon couple?

- Fuck me, and the rest of them.

- The rest?

Around here, the countryside can be pretty dangerous.

Theres deep water and all that, you know?

Sometimes, people went missing.

Walker takes a wrong turn, you know?

Someone rents a kayak and doesnt come back.

Over the years, nobody was really totting it all up.

- How many we talking about?

- Eight.

Oh.

All been tortured.

And the rest of it.

Dark sex things. Really extreme stuff.

- Yeah. Okay.

- Itd give you nightmares.

So...

Yeah, that was Iain Adair.

That is a lot.

- Mm-hmm.

- Mm.

And as you can imagine, it doesnt look great on TripAdvisor.

End result?

Fuck-all visitors.

- Didnt just shit in his victims mouths.

- Dont know he did that.

He shat on the tourist trade too.

But your dad, he recovered.

- I mean...

- Well, his injuries werent that bad.

- He was in hospital a couple of weeks.

- Right.

But while he was in there, he got MRSA.

And that killed him over time.

So, far as Mums concerned,

Iain Adair killed Dad too.

Well...

- Shes not wrong.

- Aye.

- Another pint?

- Aye.

Magda!

Three pints.

Can we go see where it happened?

Its perfect.

You dont see it?

- See what?

- Can we get in there?

No. Its boarded up. Theres planks.

Why would we wanna get in there?

Because. This is what our film should be about.

All of this.

What? This?

Wha...

Quaint little village, but for years, this Hannibal Lecter dude has been operating a death den?

At the heart of it? I mean, its a story.

- Its an actual story.

- Are you serious?

- Well, yeah.

- But...

- Were meeting the egg guy on Wednesday.

- Fuck the egg guy. Im sorry. Come on.

Come on!

You said you liked the egg idea.

Oh, babe.

I kinda liked it.

Just like I kinda like plain pasta in a pinch. But I love this.

I love it!

So, um...

A... a true crime film about Iain Adair?

We can pitch to production companies, who will fund it.

I had a meeting with Kate Cezar at Historik. She might go for this.

- People know the story.

- I didnt.

I mean, its not a whodunit.

Theres no mystery.

Are you nuts?

The mystery is,

"How could someone do that shit?"

Its "What the fuck?"

Its "Give me the details."

And the details are so awful, it is irresistible.

- Sounds tacky.

- No, no, no, no, no, no!

We wont let it be.

Itll be a... a solid piece.

Well-made, high-end.

And its exploring the biggest topic, life and death.

Its just not the kind of thing

I want us to make. Okay?

Well, then, what do you want to make?

A meditation on the Egg Man of Rùm that will maybe play at a festival and maybe be admired by a couple dozen documentary nerds?

Or something that people will watch?

Something they actually want to see!

If you dont wanna make it, I will.

Iain Adair shot my dad.

He died, Pia.

He fucking died.

- Thats real. Thats not fucking content.

- Of course. Thats not what I meant.

Itd dredge up so much shit for Mum.

She lost her husband.

Okay, okay, and we can make that point.

Her point.

He was a victim too.

You said that hes been forgotten in all of this.

It was so good. Thank you.

Did you not like the dauphinoise?

Uh, I just try to limit my carbs.

But what I had was delicious.

Oh.

Good.

We would do it justice.

It would feel and look professional.

Babe.

Its a brilliant idea.

Visual showcase. Bring the tourists back.

What was the name of that Netflix thing?

About the guy that killed women?

Maybe narrow that down.

One of them, he ate her own eye in front of her.

The Waltonville Claw.

So, half this show was just amazing, constant footage of Waltonville, forests and mountains, fucking waterfalls!

Looked like a brochure.

Yeah, my cousin actually booked a holiday just off how it looked.

Hm.

He said the place was fucking heaving when he got there.

Cunts get a load of this place on their 4K fucking flat screens and they will be crawling all over us like flies on dog shite, but with money.

Ive even got a drone you can use.

- Opening shot.

- Moody piano chord. I love it.

- Of course youve got a drone.

- Of course youre a cunt about it.

Ah!

Ive got something even better.

Wait there.

Hang on.

- Okay.

- Yes!

This is my mums curiosity box.

She was fucking obsessed with the whole thing. Obsessed.

My dad fucking hated it.

This is a whole archive.

Id call it a morbidly obsessive collection.

Man, he looks creepy.

Its not every day one of your regulars turns out to be Vlad the fucking Impaler.

- She was bound to want a souvenir.

- Will she mind if we borrow it?

She wont give a fuck.

Shes been dead for four years.

We can hook this up.

Mums Stone Age VCR.

Yeah. Ooh!

Its got a tape in it.

Mm.

Of course.

Hey, thats your moms boyfriend.

- Show us his butt.

- I think thats enough of that.

Pass us one of Stus tapes.

Should we dive in?

Its four days since Dawn and Simon Challis were last seen alive in the tourist hotspot of Loch Henry, the holiday cottage theyd rented left eerily abandoned.

Yet, despite extensive searches of the local area...

Thats Dad!

...still no sign of the missing couple.

Locals are mystified.

- It all seems quite odd.

- Thats Stuarts dad.

Everybodys worried.

I mean, Dawn, the missing girl, is very attractive, so...

Objectified much?

- Everybodys hoping theyll be okay.

- Jeez.

You shouldve asked.

About what?

All that stuff of your mums that you gave to Janets boy for his film or whatever.

Ah, keep your blouse on.

Youll get it back.

- Shouldnt be making movies about it.

- Fuck me, movies.

Christ.

Whoa.

Sorry. Sorry.

- A bit close, babe.

- No, its okay.

Davis!

Yes!

Shot at the cops.

Shot his parents. Shot himself.

But, of course, that was just scratching the surface.

What they found underneath his farmhouse was even worse.

Fucking horrible.

Okay. Uh, can we just go back to the part where you...

What the fuck was that?

- Probably broken. Stop touching it!

- Ambulance is on the way.

- Youll be all right, Mr. King.

- Fuck off me! You fuck off, you parasite!

You fucking insect!

Why dig around? Its done.

It was a thing that fucking happened, and youre here fucking pulling it all up.

And for what, eh?

For what? You want a fucking award?

A pat on the back?

Ignore him. Hes off his heid.

- Ill wait outside for the ambulance.

- Off you go. I can handle this prick.

Whats your fucking problem?

Iain Adair was an arsehole.

Can I say that?

A term like "sadist" is probably better.

Right.

- Well, he was a sadist. Thats for sure.

- You okay?

An Olympic-level...

...cunt-apathic mad man.

Just thinking, if youre staying on for a few days,

I could do my shepherds pie.

But, Pia, Im not sure if you eat meat.

I do meat.

Okay.

Anything else, Mum?

No, no. I can see youre very busy.

Thats Stuart.

Richards boy.

Aye.

What is it youre working on?

Were doing a documentary about what... happened.

Iain Adair and all that.

Not about your man and the eggs?

Uh, no.

Youll explain what he did to your father?

- Only if you want us to.

- Oh, I want you to.

People should know. Everyone should know.

My Kenny died because of that man.

If Iain Adair was still alive,

Id wring his neck myself with these hands. I would.

We were happy before he broke it all.

Ruined it all.

Such a stupid man.

Just the waste of it.

Im sorry.

Its okay, Mum.

If theres anything you want me to help with, just ask.

- Yeah?

- Clap.

There we go.

Do I need to do that too?

Oh, no. Youre okay.

Ill... Ill ask questions, and you just answer as yourself. As you.

As me?

Uh, just talk loosely about the case.

Loosely? Like, relaxed?

No.

Been years since I was in front of any kind of camera at all.

Last time wouldve been that old one your dad had.

- But your dad never had all this stuff.

- He wasnt filming for broadcast, Mum.

Can you imagine?

So, what do you think?

Well, its a fascinating case.

Iain Adair, I mean, Id heard of him.

But hes not as well-known as a Ted Bundy or a Fred West.

So... ...if we take this anywhere, the first question any platform, network, whatever, is gonna ask is,

"Whats the hook?"

Whats the context?

There is a personal angle.

I mean, his dad was one of the victims.

Uh, yeah. He... he was a policeman.

He was shot at the farm.

So, he was murdered?

He died later.

Of his injuries or...

Not directly, but... but... but basically, yeah.

But he was one of the victims.

- Mm.

- This gives him a voice.

And, you know, thats important to me, you know, as a... as a son.

I think definitely explore the personal angle, see what there is in it.

But, um, can you get hold of any new material?

Police interviews, diaries, that kind of thing.

We can look into those.

Something unseen, unheard, unexplored is what you need.

What about the house itself and the dungeon?

- Its still there.

- And you have access?

Yes.

Absolutely.

So, how come youre using this old thing?

Uh, the police forensics shot on tape back then.

Plus, old tech, cool analog horror atmosphere.

Proper Blair Witch.

Could you do that a bit more quietly?

Aye, Ill put the crowbar on whisper mode.

Okay.

Oh my God.

Okay.

♪ Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you? ♪

- This is not recording.

- Uh...

Ah, uh, yeah. Tabs punched out.

It stops people recording over it.

- Open up.

- Were taping over Bergerac?

- Mum wont notice.

- Lets hope not.

Boo!

Jesus Christ.

Oh!

I found the door to fucking hell.

Ill get a light up.

Is that your stage-blood mix?

That is still in the bag.

This is lemon juice.

- Uh, whats that for?

- Shows up under black light.

- Like piss and blood and spunk and...

- Okay, okay, okay.

Ill just drip a wee bit down here like Adair jizzed while slitting someones throat.

Fucking hell, Stuart.

Lights off, please.

And then...

Fucking hell.

I, uh... dont think we need the lemon juice.

Jesus Christ.

All right, lets get to work.

That was fucking creepy.

Feel like Ive had spiders crawling over my brain.

Have you never been in a death dungeon?

No, I find it quite relaxing.

That might be a tourist draw in itself, actually.

Good luck advertising that.

Youre likely still concussed, so we have to keep you in for observation.

- Aye, son.

- Uh-huh.

Any chance of a lift home?

Of course.

You rest up.

- Bye, now.

- Bye.

Ill put that shepherds pie on.

- Just for us girls.

- Its fine. I have stuff to digitize.

- I can just...

- You need to eat, dear.

Honestly, its no fuss.

Thank you.

Im gonna start from here, and then you guys just stand around and look like youre examining stuff.

- Good?

- Yeah.

All right, okay, fine.

And Ive seen CSI, so...

Im gonna come over your shoulder here.

Yeah, that looks good.

Maybe could you guys, like, um, cross each others frame a little bit so you look busy, like maybe theres more people?

Mr. King?

Its freezing in here.

Real forensics people dont moan about the cold while they work, do they?

- Yeah, thats good. Thank you.

- Of course.

Sorry, uh...

What do you want?

You have to stop your film.

Why?

I dont have any proof.

Of what?

I think Ive always known.

Known what?

Great.

All right, that should do it.

And Bergerac returns at the same time next week on UK Gold.

Up next, trouble for Jacko...

All right.

Okay, is this thing on?

Ah, Iain.

Yeah. What day we on now, Iain?

Iain?

I believe its day nine.

Can you take this over?

Hurry up.

Okay, as you can see, our guests are still delighted to be here.

- Arent they?

- Aye, Kenny. Over the moon.

And its a big treat today because the mistress is gonna have fun with the both of you.

- How does that sound?

- Does that sound like fun?

Aye, Kenny.

Ken gave me that.

We had such fun together.

- Everything all right?

- Yes. I need the bathroom.

Come on. Come on.

Come on.

Fuck.

Are you sure youre okay, dear?

Im just stepping out.

Out? Right now?

Yes, I just feel cooped up.

A little walk. Clear my head.

Are you sure everythings all right?

Im fine, really. I... I wont be a minute.

Shit. Come on. Come on.

Maybe the crash gave you a shock, dear.

- Youll catch cold out here.

Get in the car!

You come back now!

I wont hurt you!

No.

Cunt!

Fuck!

Cunt! Cunt!

Fuck! Cunt! Cunt! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

Fuck!

So, tell us about the film you were making.

Pia. 

Oh, lovely.

Its four days since Dawn and Simon Challis were last seen alive in the tourist hotspot of Loch Henry.

Been years since I was in front of any kind of camera at all.

You can come in now, Janet.

Sorry.

Years ago, I spent a night with Kenny and Janet and got carried away into adult stuff.

You know, sex games.

I was married.

The way they behaved that night, the whole experience, made me think that maybe Iain Adair hadnt acted alone.

Police have announced shocking new discoveries about the notorious

Loch Henry murders of the 1990s.

For years, it was thought

Iain Adair acted alone.

In fact, hed been under the guidance of local officer Kenneth McCardle and his wife, Janet.

McCardle shot the Adairs dead, deliberately wounding himself to cover up his role in the slaughter.

The woman who hid the secret of her and her husbands part in the crimes killed herself...

...after leaving recordings of the murders where her son would find them.

But your dad never had all this stuff.

He wasnt filming for broadcast, Mum.

Can you imagine?

And so, to honor this years documentaries, please welcome Kirsty Wark.

Hey, quiet down!

This is us. This is the bit.

The nominees for best factual series are...

Suffer The Children:

The Tipley Pedophile Ring.

Loch Henry: Truth Will Out.

Yes!

Euthanasia: Inside Project Junipero.

And the BAFTA goes to...

Loch Henry.

Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

Come on!

Yes!

Also, our fabulous post-house,

Cart Before Horse.

And, of course, the most important person on the stage, who allowed us to tell his story.

Id like to dedicate this award to Davis McCardle and to his late girlfriend, Pia.

Ugh. Theres that actress from that comedy about the bipolar single mum who fucking cries all the time.

Tell us a joke, love.

Shit, shes coming over.

Can I just say, I love you.

And your show was sublime.

Oh, thank you.

Um, are you the Loch Henry guy?

Oh my God.

I am not worthy.

Such an incredible piece of work.

Thank you.

Kate Cezar, Historik.

We are actually developing a drama based on the whole thing.

- Okay.

- We will be looking for a Pia.

- Thats all Im saying.

- Wow, that is interesting.

Well done, you bastard!

Its the red carpet for you, eh?

Weve been booked up for weeks, pal.

Listen to how packed it is.

Seriously, I just want to say...



## 3. Beyond the Sea



Sweetheart?

If youre gonna scratch your nose, go back to the same pose afterward.

Why do I have to be here?

Its Rickys birthday.

And hes your brother.

Okay, we all ready to go?

Lily, youre released.

Come on, buddy.

Not used to my grip yet.

Still getting accustomed to it.

Hey.

Hey.

So, um, Henry was wondering how long till dinner.

Huh.

I guess I could start.

Is that all you do, Mr. Potts?

Invent things?

- Is that all I do?

- Oh, and whats this gadget?

Thats not quite right yet, but eventually

I hope to transmit moving pictures by wireless.

- Really?

- Yes, really.

- As Marconi...

- And this?

This, madam, is a sweet-making machine.

- And is this one of the sweets?

- Yes, it is.

- Is that yours too?

- Uh, excuse me.

- Excuse me, sir.

- Yeah.

Uh, I apologize for the intrusion, but, uh, youre David Ross?

I believe I am.

- Its an honor to meet you, sir.

- Oh my God. Such an honor.

Thank you. Youre too kind.

You are so real. Uh, its incredible.

May I?

Oh my God.

Its amazing.

So, up there, are you, like, sleeping right now?

Its a kind of sleep.

The human experience, the survival of the human body, of life, thats really central to the mission...

Anyway, we have to be...

- So great to meet you.

- So great.

I know theyre excited, but sometimes they are so goddamn rude.

Oh, but they dont realize, honey.

Our Lord, Heavenly Father, bless us and these thy gifts which we take from thy bountiful goodness through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

Amen.

- Amen.

- Amen.

I know, but you guys have to wait.

Wait a second.

I said wait for ready, set, go!

Not too fast!

Its a clear win for Lily.

A clear win.

Mom, come on!

Coming.

Sleep well. I love you.

Sleep well.

Sorry, sweetheart. I gotta go.

Mm.

You staying up?

If I dont see you...

Sorry.

I have to go.

- Hey, Cliff.

- David, whats up?

Some sort of minor impact.

Probably just debris.

But... there is a crack in the solar coating.

Lets get to it.

I didnt ask. Hows the new home?

Oh, still settling in, but its good.

- Way out of the city, which I like.

- Henry liking the country air?

Hes a little quiet, but hell grow into it.

And Lana?

Cape Ann gonna be cosmopolitan enough for her?

Shes doing good.

Really?

I only met her the once, but she struck me as quite the butterfly.

I think she likes it there.

Whens our next physical?

Friday.

Okay. Ill see you Friday.

- Have a good week.

- You too.

Hey.

Still reading.

Really just looking at the words, you know?

Mm.

Maybe we should have a little party.

A party?

- Whos gonna drive all the way out here?

- For the local folks.

Say hello.

Meet the neighbors.

Something small. In the garden.

I dont know.

Be good for Henry to meet some local kids.

Well see.

Get out of my house.

Oh, weve met the machine man.

What a trip.

Im Kappa.

This is Sigma, Theta, and thats Epsilon.

I dont give a shit.

Youre in my house.

Indeed we are.

- Do you have a cock?

- Good question.

All of you leave right now.

Now!

- Youre rude not to answer me.

- Im telling you to get out of my house.

Gonna bash your friend Kappas brains in in your beautiful room here?

If I have to.

That might disrupt your frequency.

If you all leave right now, nothing has to happen.

No stranger in the crowd could doubt twas Casey at the bat.

Get him.

Where even are you, man?

Get him in position. Come on.

Lay his arm out.

Lets see whats inside your hand, hmm?

No! No, no, no, no!

Yeah. Yep.

No! No, no, no, no, no!

That is a tough steak.

Freaky.

Oh, you dont even bleed right.

You are nothing natural, my friend.

Fuck.

Sigma, give me your hammer.

Theta, get his family.

No! No!

No!

Try to work out where you are.

Come on! Come on!

Please.

Please, not my children. Please!

Please. Please, not my children.

Then whose children are they, huh?

We just wanna find out who else is a machine, Mr. Bunny.

No, no, no, no, no.

No, none of us... none of us are.

Uh, its just... its just him.

Its just David.

Were real.

Were real. I...

Blood. Real blood, where I got cut.

Yeah, I... I dont doubt youre real.

Yeah.

- And your kids are real.

- Yeah!

Im sorry to report thats immaterial, sugar.

Because the way the facts run, none of what has occurred in your home, with your full knowledge, is right in nature.

A man sleeps in the sky while his mechanical image walks the earth.

And you... share your bed with this abomination?

Hmm?

You know none of this is right.

How can it be?

Defying nature must have a cost, or what will become of us all?

So, yes, you.

- And, yes, the children.

- No...

And the machine man will watch with his heart screaming a million miles above us.

Please, no.

Please! Please, no!

- Epsilon, you start.

- No!

No!

No!

Hello.

Uh, what?

Wait, wait, wait.

What the hell are you saying?

David?

David, its me.

David.

Leave me alone.

Im so sorry.

I said get out of here!

He told me to get out.

Spoke to Ground Control.

Holland says just leave him be.

Hell be in shock.

Sons of bitches that did this walked into a station and gave themselves up.

Some sort of hippie cult.

Board says if we feel we need protection, we can have it, but we are a long way from California.

I keep thinking of them.

Jessica.

Those kids.

I cant even imagine.

Bastards even destroyed his replica.

Set it on fire.

That means the whole time that I am down here, hes just alone up there.

Two years down on the mission, another four to go.

Cant they make him another replica somehow?

They made these while we were still back down here.

Now its just not possible.

Even if they could, what does he have left here?

Soil and nutrients stable.

CO light absorption functioning.

Purity at 93%.

"The Lord is my shepherd.

I shall not want."

"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures."

"He leadeth me beside the still waters."

"He restoreth my soul."

"He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his names sake."

"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

I will fear no evil."

"For thou art with me."

"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me."

- Paying attention?

- Yeah.

All right.

There we go.

Youre up.

Airlock issue. I gotta run.

Hey!

Hey!

Everything okay?

Sure.

Just looking things over.

You dont know he was gonna throw himself out.

I dont know.

I mean, if he were to do something,

Im still up there.

Thats a two-man ship.

It relies on the both of us.

If there was, like, a computer malfunction, some sort of technical issue, that is me dead too.

Dont say that.

We have to think about this.

The man is lost.

I cant reach him, and I dont know what to do.

What if... what if you let him use your link?

My link?

As in...

Say, just for an hour.

Time enough to let him walk in the woods, feel... feel the breeze on his face.

I dont know.

Itd be strange for you and Henry.

Henry doesnt need to know.

David might not even want that.

Even asking could be a kindness.

Okay.

0800 hours, commencing routine checks.

Distance to target, 4.7 AU.

Listen, David,

I was talking with Lana, and we both feel that you could use a break.

How would you feel about using my link?

Just for a little while.

Breathe some... air.

The house, its a long way from anywhere.

Its real private.

Theres a forest out back, a couple streams for fishing.

Its a good place.

Would you... would you like that?

I think Id like that very much.

So...

Ill head to the link now.

How should I speak to him?

I mean, in manner?

Quiet?

Serious, or...

I dont know, regular?

Like it didnt happen?

I mean...

You know what I mean.

Well... he used to be talkative, but right now, hes not easy to read.

Just let him take in the air.

You ready?

Hello.

Hi.

Cliff said it might take a little getting used to.

Would you like to see the forest?

Yes.

Thank you.

Wow.

This is my favorite spot.

Mm.

The air is so clear.

Id forgotten.

Hm.

Hey.

Hey.

He likes you.

What is it?

Uh...

Nothing.

Just...

Youve quite the home.

Your place... is beautiful.

Thank you.

Glad you enjoyed it.

Well, I best be, uh...

Of course.

Ill see you Friday.

See you then.

Hey.

You scared me.

Well, it feels like that really worked.

He seems a little lighter now.

So, how was it?

The poor man. He wept like a child.

In front of you?

Mm-hmm.

What did you do?

Not much. I...

He sat up by the old tree.

What... what could I even say?

Yeah.

Hey.

Let me show you something.

You did this from memory?

When something is vivid,

I just kind of see it.

Wait, this is quite something.

If I had this down there,

I would hang it on the wall.

You know... if you guys could maybe get me a canvas and some oils,

I could paint you something like this for your home.

Like a thank-you gift.

Uh-huh.

I mean, obviously, youd have to let me use your replica again.

- You might not want to do that.

- Its just...

Drawing helps.

Id love to be able to paint again.

An oil painting.

I mean, how long would a painting take?

Well, a little while, obviously.

Okay.

Look, I understand.

I shouldnt ask. Its not fair.

Im sorry.

Let me think it over.

Okay?

Okay.

Thank you.

Just an hour?

One hour.

Once a week, while Im doing the physical.

I mean, it does make sense.

He can set up his things up in the barn there.

He had a list of what hed need, canvas and fancy paints and whatnot.

Clearly, it has been on his mind.

What do you say?

Okay?

Everything you need?

Think we got your whole list.

Looks like it.

Thank you.

How you finding that? Valley of the Dolls?

Oh.

Cant say Im crazy about it.

I mean, its fun, but my goodness, its trashy.

A guilty pleasure.

The guiltiest.

Do you like sci-fi?

Cant say Ive tried it.

There arent many books in the house.

Cliff doesnt really read.

Ill think of a few recommendations for you.

Id like that.

Sir, may I leave the table?

Good boy.

Have you done much painting?

Not since kindergarten.

Here.

Um, I cant. Id make a mess of it.

Its fine. You make a mess,

I can paint right over it.

Here you go.

Why dont you just try to add a little to the tree there?

How... how do I...

Dont be afraid of it.

Just a... just a light... light stroke.

Okay, thats a blob.

Its fine.

Here, just move the brush through it.

Here.

Like... this.

There we go.

Perfectly good leaf.

Mom!

- Better see what he wants.

- Of course.

His paintings looking good.

Everything okay?

Do you have any linseed oil? Ive run out.

Linseed oil?

Yeah. It, uh, thins the paint without mussing up the color.

Uh, Wesson oil any use to you?

Nah, that wont do it.

Is there a hardware store in town?

Theres Mitchells. Theyll be open.

You think Cliff would mind if we borrow his car?

Got it.

Great.

Hey, I wanna check the bookstore out a moment.

You wanna come?

Sure.

He wears it out.

This is a good one.

I think youll like it.

Im sorry, I have to ask.

Are you Cliff Stanfield?

- Yes.

- I thought it was you.

Well, not you, but your, um...

What do you call it?

Replica.

Replica.

The things they can do!

And you must be Mrs. Stanfield.

Yes.

Heard you both moved into the old Watson place.

How you finding it?

Well, its, uh...

- I mean, its wonderful.

- Oh, so beautiful up that way.

Great place for a family.

Absolutely.

I was so sorry to hear about what happened with your copilot, Mr. Ross.

His whole family...

Such a terrible thing.

Well...

Yes.

How is he doing?

Hes holding up.

We really ought to be going.

Of course.

So nice to meet you.

Thanks.

You okay?

All yours.

Thank you.

See you Friday.

Hey.

Take a look.

Is... is that...

You added me?

You dont mind, do you?

No.

No, not at all. Im flattered.

Lana!

Its okay.

Ive given you the wrong idea.

He wont know.

Stop!

Hey.

You want this.

Get away from me.

You come here. You... you confuse me.

You pick out gifts. You mess with my head.

Work your way into my home wearing my husband like a suit.

But this is not your home, and you are not my husband.

That man is no match for you.

You are a guest in this house.

- And you want this.

- You dont know me.

I know the way you look at me.

At you?

Henry?

You should go.

Everything okay?

All fine.

David says

Henry wrecked his painting.

He hit him!

He gave him a little smack upside the head.

Which, as far as Henry knows, was from you.

Nothing I havent done myself a hundred times.

You know Henry can be a terror.

Remember when he burned a hole in the car seat? I whaled on him plenty, right here in this room.

The boy needs keeping in line.

Look.

- David wants to finish the painting.

- The goddamn painting.

I know.

Lets just let him finish the painting.

Okay? That will be one, two more visits tops.

And then... I will come up with something.

An excuse.

Okay?

Okay.

- Lana, listen.

- Your things are set up in the barn.

- Lana, please.

- Im taking Henry to the pool.

I got an alert.

Whats up?

You gonna explain that?

Its ju... Its... its a drawing.

Just a stupid...

Like a fantasy.

Maybe I will bust your jaw.

You want a busted jaw?

Im sorry. Its not what...

My wife!

You fucking creep!

My wife. Mine!

Its pure fantasy. I got mixed up.

Oh, you got mixed up?

Shes so beautiful. Its...

Jesus Christ.

Why cant you see?

I dont have anything.

Ive got nothing at all.

You have no idea what its like to be me.

Everything I had...

Gone. Just destroyed.

You dont know.

You have got it all, and you dont even care.

I care plenty.

Your wife is a lonely woman.

Shes all alone there.

Unappreciated.

- Unsatisfied.

- You shut your mouth.

Untouched.

I will put you through this goddamn wall!

You dont know what youve got.

I know damn well.

Do you?

How much longer we gotta sit here?

Till your fathers home.

- Henry, go inside.

- Yes, sir.

- Cliff, whats wrong?

- Tell me whats gone on.

You and him. Whats gone on?

I dont know what youre talking about.

What did you do?

I told you, nothing.

Did you pose for him?

No, I did not pose for him.

Show him your body?

Of course not.

Did he touch you?

No.

Did you touch him?

- No.

- Take him to our bed?

Absolutely not.

Tell me what happened!

Nothing. I swear.

He drew you naked.

In his quarters. Up there, onboard.

- I dont know what he drew.

- He draws from memory.

- From memory!

- He has seen nothing.

Give me the truth!

- I...

- Give me the truth!

I swear on my life, on Henrys life, nothing happened.

But he wanted it to.

Yes.

- And you still let him come down here.

- You knew I didnt want him here anymore.

You never said that.

I told you he hit our son, and you did not listen to me.

You didnt listen!

He said that

I dont touch you.

How did he know that?

I would never say anything like that to anyone.

So, then, how did he know?

I dont know.

He thinks that youre lonely.

All the time youre here, Im lonely.

We came here for you!

You brought me here, put me in this house.

Now I just walk from room to room, and you walk from room to room, but youre a shadow, and I am here. I am real!

So, no, he didnt touch me, but I wished he did. I...

For, like, a... a moment... for a moment, it felt like my husband was back, and he saw that Im real, and I want that. I...

And I wished he did too.

Im sorry.

Hey.

Listen.

What?

I wanted to apologize.

I overstepped the mark, and I apologize.

Nothing happened with Lana.

I know.

She wasnt interested.

Listen.

I know you dont want me using your link anymore. Its just...

Id like to apologize to her in person.

I owe her an apology too.

Hey.

Could I at least say goodbye to her?

I just wanna say goodbye.

Thats not gonna happen.

You know what she told me?

That your visits offend her.

That you offend her.

The thought of you returning makes her vomit.

She says that youre a snake.

A conman.

The worst kind.

The arrogant kind.

She wont have you anywhere near her.

She is mine.

For all time, she is mine.

Every day, every night, in every way.

You will not see or speak to her ever again.

Whos a good boy?

Damn it. Some kind of emergency.

What is it?

Small impact a few minutes ago.

Coolant tubing took a hit.

Its leaking pretty bad.

Hey, Im at coolant four.

No visible signs of damage.

David, you sure it was coolant four?

David?

David?

David!

David!

David!

Where the hell were you?

Bathroom.

The bathroom?

Coolant four was fine.

Goddamn systems sending out false reports.

Gotta get on to McKenzie.

This is not acceptable.

Wheres my tag?

My tag.

What did you do?

Come on.

Lana?

Lana?

No, no, no, no.

No.

Lana?

No!



## 4. Mazey Day



And, of course, the news that everyone is talking about in LA today is that the Tom-Kitten has a name.

Thats right. Tom and Katie have issued a statement naming their new baby Suri.

Thats right, folks, Suri Cruise.

According to the statement, Su...

Hey, Bo. Whats up?

Yeah, J.P., Ive been sitting here for two hours, but theres no sign of them.

So, theyre still at it?

- Are you sure it was him?

- Have I ever let you down?

Ill let you know.

Hey. Can I talk to you?

You with an agency?

I can pay.

For those pictures.

Five hundred dollars?

Youre killing me.

Please.

- Shit.

- Lady, please. You cant do this.

Youre killing me!

Fuck.

Fucking animal!

TVs Justin Camley enjoys a little afternoon delight with a male buddy.

Okay. This, this, and this.

- Two-fifty each.

- Two-fifty?

Come on, man. Three hundred.

Camley hasnt been on TV in, like, four years.

He was on that VH1 thing.

And he offered me 500.

Okay.

Three each.

♪ Dont wanna tell you what it is ♪

♪ Ooh-wee, it felt so serious ♪

♪ Got me thinking just too much ♪

♪ I wanna set it off, but... ♪

Bo?

♪ Its this one thing

That got me trippin ♪

- Bo.

- Hey... Oh!

- Hey, sorry.

- Hey.

Sorry.

I got paid. Its a new toy.

Can you believe how small it is?

- Thats great.

- Yeah.

- Cool, right?

- Yeah.

So, you know I dont like to judge other peoples lifestyle choices.

But I have really delicate sinuses.

And when you fry garlic and ginger, it just makes the whole apartment a little acrid?

Yeah, sure, Ill, um...

- Yeah, Ill open the window, Nathan.

- Thank you so much.

Yeah.

US and Iraqi troops have been engaging the militants in a house-to-house battle as they try to clear out the remaining pockets of resistance.

The US military...

Hey, Ill take a skinny vanilla latte.

Sure.

...to support the ongoing operation.

And we have celebrity news breaking right now here in Hollywood.

Former Sea of Tranquility star

Justin Camley has been found dead in his Hollywood Hills home.

TMZ are reporting he was found hanged in an apparent suicide.

Only days ago, the scandal broke that Justin had been cheating on his long-term girlfriend with another man.

This whole Justin Camley situation is sad as shit, Bo, but its not your fault.

You were just doing your job, thats all.

Yeah, I know.

- Cant say I sympathize with the guy.

- Whitty, come on.

Sorry. Did someone force him to become an actor?

Whitty, shut the fuck up.

He wanted his face out there, money, the rest of it.

And then he gets sad because he feels "exposed."

Its just dumb.

Cant handle the consequences, dont enter the game.

Dukes right.

And half of these assholes would kill themselves if we didnt take their picture.

My limo guy says hes got Sydney Alberti in the back.

Slutty Alberti.

Slutty Alberti.

Where you going to stay tonight, Sydney?

Come on, Sydney!

Sydney!

- Sydney, over here.

- Come on!

- Right here.

- Youre looking beautiful. I love...

Sydney, right here!

- Sydney!

- Looking great. I love that dress.

- You look great in white.

- What are you wearing?

Sydney! This way, you skank!

I love your sex tape. Fucking whore!

You piece of shit!

Say it to my fucking face!

- Say it to my face!

- You touch me again. That is assault!

Ive got witnesses!

You tou... Touch me again!

Youre gonna hear from my lawyer.

Miss Cattermole? Is everything all right?

Never better.

Cut!

Okay, guys, thats a wrap for day two.

Take your sides for tomorrow if you dont have them.

Make sure you check your call sheets for pre-call. Great job.

- Um, give me that.

- Thank you.

Um, theres a treat in the pocket from Stephan.

Oh.

"I was schooled at Wycombe Abbey."

"I was schooled at Wycombe Abbey."

Wick.

Wick-um.

Wick-um.

Abbey.

Abbey.

"I was schooled at Wycombe Abbey."

I was schooled at...

Wycombe. Wycombe Abbey.

Road is closed. I go around.

What did he... what did he say?

They found man in road.

A man?

Mm-hmm. They think hit-and-run.

Mazey, Hair and Makeup are ready for you.

Its been two whole weeks since Mazey Day, star of the EverWish saga, abruptly left the set of the third installment of the franchise.

No one has seen her...

- I... I heard you come in.

- Yeah.

This is really hard for me.

Im not good at confrontation, so my therapist suggested that I use cue cards.

And...

Mm.

"As you know, your share of the rent is late."

"And I have noticed groceries disappearing from my clearly marked personal shelf in the fridge."

- "While I truly value our friendship..."

- Nathan.

Please.

"I do not feel it is appropriate for me to financially support..."

Nathan.

Ill get the money.

Thank you.

All right, thats Erika and Brad.

Have a nice day, yall.

Sup, Bo?

Havent you heard? No dogs allowed.

Meow.

You got a minute?

Like I said, Hec, Im out.

Im not trying to tempt you back in.

Yeah, cause youre scared of the competition.

Maybe I respect your decision.

Thought about that?

So, why are you here?

I thought that maybe you could help me with something.

Help you with what?

Mazey Day.

The actress.

Yeah, Mazey Day. What about her?

You know, shes filming in Czechoslo-somewhere, one of those.

Started day drinking. Erratic behavior.

Stopped showing up to set.

Angry one day, fucking weeping the next.

Basically gone fucking wacko.

So, thats your professional psychiatric opinion of the situation?

She got kicked off the movie set two weeks ago, flew home, and no ones seen her since.

Not home, nowhere.

So, everybodys cool with leaving her alone, then?

Nicks offering 30K for the first photo of her.

- 30K?

- 30K.

Forty if you catch her looking like a junkie.

Ive been hitting up all my peeps, but no leads. Nothing. Nada.

You, um, still keep in touch with your snitch?

I took his number off my phone.

All right, well, if you happen to find that you wrote it somewhere, let me know.

- Hey, J.P.

- Hey, stranger.

Um...

- Have you heard anything on Mazey Day?

- Thought youd given up on all this.

Yeah, this could be the kind of payday I could use.

Look, I only know what everyone else knows.

Shes not at home.

Gotta be holed up somewhere, but no clue.

All right, cool.

Uh, let me know if that changes.

Hello? Food delivery.

Oh, I think I have some money in my purse.

Its okay.

Mr. G said while youre a guest in his house, hes left money to cover everything.

So, she still has a membership, but she hasnt been since when?

You havent seen her in a while.

You can give me a call if she pops by again.

Let me know if that changes.

You can call me here if anything changes.

Thank you. Bye.

Where the fuck are you?

Hmm.

Mazey Days a fan, huh?

She says she orders here every week?

Mm-hmm.

- Come on.

- She still does.

Saw her yesterday.

Really?

Shes staying at some, like, producers house.

Ms. Day?

The first step is to recognize that youre not in control of this.

It has taken you over.

And you must be humble in the face of it.

Hm?

Ive arranged a place where we can take you.

Private, out of town, just for a few days.

You need isolation.

Away from anyone and anything.

Dr. Babich.

Can you get me better?

Well, its about getting you through tonight.

And then the next night.

Then we see.

Okay.

Shit.

Fuck yeah.

This better be you, Mazey.

The fuck are we going?

Fuck it.

Oh shit.

Fuck.

Oh shit.

Hey. What the fuck?

Goddammit!

Fuck!

Thanks, guys. Thank you very much.

Thank you.

Day going well?

Absolutely not.

Im guessing you could use a coffee.

Or a beer?

Coffees fine.

Coffee it is.

Do you know anyone with a tow truck around here?

- Car trouble?

- Yeah.

Uh, Mitch runs the repair shop in town, but he came by here this morning.

Hell be gone for the day.

Would he come if I called him?

No, I mean, you know...

...gone for the day.

Oh God.

Is there a motel within crawling distance?

Uh, the only place near here is the Cedar Wood Retreat.

Thats really more of a rehab place.

A rehab?

Yeah, but for, like, rich hippie types, you know?

Its a little New Age for my blood.

Maybe they have a bed for the night?

Yeah, you got no chance of that.

Uh, Kyle, thats my uncle, most days hes a masseuse there.

He says someone hired the entire complex for the weekend.

The whole place?

All the staff sent home, so its empty, ultra-private.

The whole place for, like, one person the whole time.

Any clue who the one person is?

Someone rich who wants to get straight on the down-low.

Oh, hey. You were right.

- Compliments to the chef.

- Mm-hmm.

- Thumbs up for the pecan pie, Jesse.

- We aim to please.

Wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey, no, no.

- Come on. Lets go.

- I just got here.

Thats a long-ass ride.

No time for a soda?

You want a soda, or you want Mazey Day?

Yeah, thats what I thought. Thank you.

- You actually know where were going?

- Just shut up and trust me.

- It was worth a shot.

- Was it?

- What if it would have opened the door?

- No ones hopping this fence.

What is this, Jurassic Park?

Got a T. rex in there or something?

No, theyre just keeping people like us out.

How sure are you shes in there?

85%.

85%?

Maybe 80.

- Eighty? Its gonna be 75 in a...

- Wait, wait, wait. You hear that?

Hide the bike.

Oh shit.

Is that Whittys car?

- Did you tell him?

- No, did you?

No!

Hey, ladies.

- Whered you put it? Underneath my seat?

- Wheres what?

Your fucking tracker is what.

I think of it as an unpaid informant.

Its under the gas tank.

Two chunks of shit!

Like youve never popped one under a limo.

- This is legit journalism.

- Oh, Mr. Pulitzer.

- Hes adorable.

- This is stealing intel.

Ooh, yeah, some intel.

Fuck you doing out here, huh?

Its gotta be Mazey Day, right?

- This was my find.

- Yeah, I heard of this place.

Private A-list "holistic experiences."

Super kooky.

Sounds like a rehab joint.

Lets find a way in.

Fuckin...

Fucking privacy screen.

Which means whatever they do on the other side has gotta be worth seeing.

- Youre literally crawling in the dirt.

- Shut up.

Ladies first.

- Terry.

- Hey, Clay.

- Ill do the chicken.

- Sure thing.

What the hell is that sound?

Its like a power tool.

Doors opening.

Is he carrying a rivet gun?

Fuck, thats the guy who slashed my tires.

Mazey Day is here.

Okay, my friends. Thats Dmitri Babich, specialist doctor to the stars.

Ah, the big addiction guy.

My guess says shes on crystal meth.

More like coke.

Isnt Babich into holistic voodoo or some shit? Is he even a doctor?

For Hollywood, just about.

She mustve been desperate to call him in.

Okay.

Is that her?

- I think its her.

- Holy shit. This is 30 grand.

Is that a fucking chain?

- Is that a fucking chain around her neck?

- Kinky shit.

What?

Babich shackled her up for the cold turkey.

Thats fucking illegal, Hector.

- Shit.

- Jesus!

Bo, what the fuck... Bo, what are you...

Shit!

Oh shit.

Oh shit. Fuck.

Oh my God.

Shit!

Guys, shes burning up.

So much for sexy shots.

You gotta go.

Guys, can you just stop for one minute?

Stop! Shes chained to the floor!

They say I gotta be alone.

Gotta get through this alone.

They say a lot of shit!

Okay. Were gonna get you out.

What the fuck?

Get the fuck away from me!

- Here we go.

- Get the fuck away.

- Mazey?

- Please.

You dont understand!

Mazey, I just...

Mazey.

Go!

Run! Run away!

- Oh fuck!

- What the fuck is this?

Oh!

Just go!

- Please!

- Bo, Bo, Bo.

- Oh my God!

- Oh my God! What the fuck?

Bo, Bo, Bo. No, we gotta go, Bo.

We have to go, Bo!

Oh my God. Whats wrong with her?

Oh, fuck me.

- Go, go, go, go, go!

- Shit, shit.

- We gotta go!

- Just a couple more.

Lets go! Lets go! Lets go!

Come on! Lets go!

- Guys! Guys, help!

- Shit.

Help!

- Hector, what are you doing?

- His shots are worth a million each, Bo.

A million...

...each!

- Come on.

- Come on! Go, go, go, go!

Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

Goddamn.

Its good, right?

Another satisfied victim.

Goddamn, Jesse.

Good to know.

Thats what you ought to call that,

"pecan perfection."

I mean, the chicken was perfection.

The chicken was perfect.

- It is so easy to screw up chicken.

- Oh yeah.

Not many people know this.

They think, "Oh, well, you just drop it in the deep fryer." No.

Its not about frying chicken.

Youre gonna sauté it, bake it...

But its gotta be done, you know...

Because you undercook it, and, you know, people die.

Lock it.

Whoa, whoa! What...

- What...

- Okay.

Are you okay? What...

What is...

It could come in. Its out there!

It could be coming this way!

We need to block the door!

Maam. What has happened?

- Maam, calm down.

- Officer. Please just call for help.

- Calm down.

- Call for help! Call for help!

- I will momentarily, maam, but first...

- Please.

- Fucking call for help!

- Calm down.

Take a few deep breaths, settle down, and explain to me what has happened.

Then maybe we can figure out how were gonna move forward.

No, just please fucking call for help!

- I will do that momentarily, maam.

- Shes here.

But first, I need to understand...

No, no, no, no!

- Okay, back up!

- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Officer. Sir.

- Stay down. Stay down.

- No, you dont under...

Officer! Officer! Its out there, Officer!

You need to call for backup, Office...

Hey, Jesse, you okay?

Jesse?

No!

Hec. Hec.

Kill me.

Please.

Kill me.

Please.

Just... just shoot me.

Got a customer.

- Im on my lunch.

- Yeah, I can smell that.

Mines in five minutes, so if I start with a customer now, it cuts into my break.

Thats Keith Holligan.

So?

So he murdered his wife.

Oh, it were manslaughter.

Judge said she drove him to it.

Dont seem like the strangling type to me.

- Puffy hands.

- Surely, we dont have to serve him.

Everyone needs shoes, Nida.

How about doing your job?

I think Im going to need the 11.

Im large.

For my height.

- Sure you cant do a discount?

- Im so sorry. No, we cant.

Im just a bit strapped till the end of the month.

I can put them aside for you.

Go on, then.

If you fancy writing down your number,

I wont mind.

Reckon hes into your sort.

Time and time and time again!

And so weve been treated to this rather pathetic display of a flailing government holding on for dear life.

And it is thanks to Mr. Callaghans government limping on that our nation has suffered through a winter of discontent.

Now, they promise us a brighter future, yet the fact remains that Labour isnt working.

- Hes a bit bloody young, int he?

- Hes good though.

They havent just failed nationally, but right here in Tipley.

You only have to look around to see it.

Rubbish in the streets. Crime on the rise.

The character of your neighborhood under threat.

Bloody right!

We dont wanna end up like Cheetham.

You hear what he said? He said,

"We dont wanna end up like Cheetham."

Of course, we all want change, but the right kind.

So dont just hope for a better future.

Vote for one!

Thank you. Thank you very much.

As the election nears, polls show

Mrs. Thatchers Conservative Party retains a commanding lead.

Violence erupts as the far-right

National Front march through Southall, causing thousands in damage with over 100 arrests and five police officers hospitalized.

US and Soviet nuclear non-proliferation talks hit...

Down two places to number six,

"Does Your Mother Know" by ABBA.

A new entry at five for Paul McCartney and Wings with "Good Night Tonight."

And at number four right now here in the studio with their hit "Rasputin," its Boney M.

Youre dreaming if you think you can pull that off.

Mr. Duncan wants a word.

So, Nida, its nothing major, but I understand youre in the habit of eating your lunch in the stockroom.

- Oh...

- Its fine.

Everybody does it.

We dont mind. But its... its what youre eating.

You see, most peoples food, um, normal food, it doesnt tend to linger afterwards.

Its not really fair on your coworkers, and there is a chance it could... well, it could get into the shoe leather.

So, if you must eat in there, maybe just bring in a sandwich.

Like a cheese and ham sandwich.

Or just a cheese sandwich, if youre one of those that doesnt do ham.

- Of course, Im sorry to have to ask...

- Ill do sandwiches from now on.

You know, I think Vicky will be very appreciative.

But as... as will we all.

The thing is,

I did bring a biryani in today.

I see.

Well, um, its... How about the basement?

- Yes! Yes, you could use the basement.

- The basement?

Mr. Possett himself used to work down there in the early days.

He didnt like to be disturbed.

It couldnt be further from civilization.

Thank you, Mr. Duncan.

Very good. Very good. Thank you, Nida.

What?

Hello, what do you want?

Just taking my lunch break.

Hmm.

Hmm?

Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life.

Medium atomic weights are available.

Gold, Lead, Copper.

Jet, Diamond, Radium,

Sapphire, Silver, and Steel.

Sapphire and steel have been assigned.

Hello.

So, where are they?

Mum and Dad?

- Gone.

- Gone? Gone where?

Out of the door, downstairs?

Well, where, then?

Here in the room?

You mean they disappeared, Helen?

Uh, yeah, hi.

So, my names Gaap. Im a demon.

You anointed this talisman with your blood, so now were bound together and...

Bloody hell.

Look, I... Ive got a whole introductory speech here.

We... we gotta work together.

Can you pick me up?

Come on, pick me up.

Just... just pick me up.

Please?

Thats it. Come on. Come on.

I... I... I wont bite.

I promise. Come on.

Right. So, as I was saying, you anointed the talisman, and the rules are youve gotta carry out three human sacrifices over the next three days or else the worlds gonna end.

What?

If you want me to help you, you need to permit me entry.

Uh...

Dost thou permit me entry? Yes or no?

This isnt real.

You have to say "yes."

Just say the word "yes." Say it.

If you say "yes," Ill... Ill stop, okay?

Ill go away.

Youll never hear from me again, like this didnt happen. Just say "yes." Say it.

Say it. Come on, say it. Say it.

Say it! Say it! Say it!

Yes!

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Come on. Whats the matter?

All right, I gotta be honest.

I lied about going away.

Uh, hang on. Is it... is it these?

Yeah, yeah, sorry. My regular appearance is probably a bit much for this realm.

Uh, just a sec.

This any better for ya?

I peered into your soul, and apparently, this is a physical look you find appealing, so...

Maybe you saw this recently and liked it?

I dont know. Let me have a look.

Wow.

Uh...

Okay. Am I, like, a clown?

This how clowns dress in your realm?

I mean...

I mean, I can... I can work with it, but...

Uh...

You have got to get over the shock and just talk to me.

You know, we have got to work together.

Im dreaming.

Dream... Youre really not, you know.

Youre not real.

Youre not real.

Youre not real. Youre not real.

Hiya. Like I said, we have got to work together.

Its blood and bone. You marked the talisman. I dont make the rules.

I mean, basically, we need to deliver three sacrifices by Maymass...

Uh, thats May Day to you. Or else its...

Well, its burning skies time.

I sense you need some convincing.

Uh...

Let me show you how this will play out, all right?

Whatll happen if we dont succeed.

You ready?

Ready?

Three, two, one.

So, basically, this is the sort of thing were dealing with.

Scorching wall of flame.

Its agonizing death for all, and so on.

See, burning people, they do smell like youd expect, dont they?

Like a... a burger on a griddle.

Its quite nice if you disassociate from it.

Mind you, the charred hair really gets stuck in your throat.

To be honest, I dont want the apocalypse to come about any more than you do.

So lets stop it happening, you and me.

All we have to do is deliver three sacrifices in three days.

Its only three killings.

Like I said, animals dont count.

You have to do humans.

And theres gotta be a cadence to it.

One a day.

Its one kill a day. It... its...

Wha... what?

That is fewer people than die falling off ladders in the same time period.

Youd be less lethal than a ladder.

If I talk to you, youre real, so Im not gonna talk to you.

Well, we started conversing already, so that ship has sailed.

- No, it hasnt.

- Oh, oh, yes, it has.

Uh, dont worry. Were a team.

Im on your side here, you know?

Lets just get kill number one under your belt. Start racking em up.

You can stop it because I am not killing anyone.

...so I dont know why you keep talking to me!

Thats what Im here for.

All right? Moral support.

So just hold on to that brick.

Lets go thwack someone.

- What brick?

- The one in your hand, love.

Im not doing what you say.

Whats that, love?

Oh yeah.

Yeah, hes perfect.

Theres no witnesses.

- Talk about beginners luck.

- No.

One quick pop to the head and youre done.

Please, make him stop.

Make who stop?

Love? Are you all right?

- I need a doctor.

- You want me to go and call one?

Would it help if I told you

I can see into this mans soul, and he absolutely deserves to die?

- Shut up!

- Hes got a daughter.

Her names Laura. Shes eight years old.

Do you wanna know what he does to her?

To Laura?

- No, I dont wanna know.

- Sorry, love. I dont follow.

He pays Laura a little nighttime visit...

Shut up!

Is everything okay?

Do you wanna know how the bastard makes her feel? Get a load of this.

She kills herself, aged 28, exhausted by the pain and the shame of it.

Maybe put that down.

Yeah, it does take some getting used to,

Ill grant you that.

But a couple more of those and Ill be out of your hair.

Look, hang on.

Uh... Yeah, yeah. Look, see? One line gone.

Thats one sacrifice registered.

Two to go.

Youve got a whole day to pick the next one.

Oh, come on. You...

You forgot to flush.

Oof. Fuck me.

Sorry to disturb you, sir.

- What is it, Suz?

- A missing person.

Boy or girl?

A 39-year-old man.

A Tim Simons.

No, dont know him.

His wife said he didnt come home last night.

Yeah, because hes on the piss.

Its not even 24 hours yet.

I know, but, sir, the thing is, she says his dog came home without him.

I suppose we stopped taking pictures of each other.

Here.

Thats him.

He... he never stays out. He...

Somethings happened. I know it.

We dont know anythings happened at all.

Hello.

Whos this?

Its okay.

Its okay, Laura.

This man and this lady are going to help find Daddy.

Worried sick, arent you, love?

How long are you just gonna sit there for?

Youre late for work. You have to go in.

You cant have people getting suspicious.

I mean it.

If you dont turn up...

Fucking shut up!

I killed a man.

- Ive killed someone.

- Yeah, that was hours ago.

I keep feeling the crack of his skull on the brick.

I did that.

Its your fault.

Youre not even...

Im crazy.

Im a crazy person.

They said Mum was mad.

Theyll say it about me.

But this time, theyll be right.

Theyll be totally bloody right.

Hey, look, look. Youre not crazy.

Im a murderer.

Yeah, but youre not a crazy one.

Why is this happening?

Look.

This is actually my first assignment.

Its more of an initiation, really.

Sort of earning my wings.

I mean, Im new to this too.

Im not a bad person.

Oh no. No. It wouldnt work if you were.

It has to be someone corruptible.

So, I mean, if you think about it, whats happening here, it actually reflects really well on your character.

Huh?

Yeah.

What... what are you doing?

- Calling the police.

- What? Why?

- Why?

- So theyll arrest me.

But then you wont be able to do the other sacrifices.

Good!

Then the apocalypse will happen, and billions will die.

I mean, I know. I get it.

You dont want the blood of three victims on your hands, but if it saves billions...

Hello, emergency services.

What service do you require?

Hello?

Hello? Is anyone there...

See? You... you are a good person.

What do I do?

Just carry on as usual so the normals dont get spooked, which means going to work.

And while youre there, we can decide who to kill next.

Hello.

Whats this?

You were supposed to be in at 9:00.

I threw up this morning.

I thought I might be ill.

Oh, dont come near me.

I dont want your germs.

You look awful.

Well, shes nice.

Front-runner for the old...

I think.

Uh, she does steal from the till, you know.

- Gotta pick someone!

- Sh!

God, I... I do love a little old lady. Hey...

Oh, isnt she sweet?

She cant stop thinking about the end though.

They cant wait for it to come.

Youd be doing her a favor.

Shut up.

- What was that, love?

- Nothing.

- She dreams of death. Even now...

- How are those for you?

I think theyre good.

Ill just go and have a little look.

Just do it. No one will miss her.

No, shut up.

Shes nearly dead already.

Very nice.

Sir?

- Sir?

- Yeah?

They said youre in here.

That was nice of em.

- Can it wait?

- Its Tim Simons.

Oh aye. Turned up, has he?

He has, sir, but hes dead.

Someones clobbered him, sir.

So they have.

So, come on.

What time do you finish?

Depends what time you wanna start.

Maybe I wont wanna stop.

And maybe I wont wanna stop you.

How about this handsome fucker, eh?

Gods gift till he loses his hair at 32 and spends the next 29 years taking it out on his missus.

- Stop showing me this stuff.

- His missus wont be her.

She never marries. Very sad.

Well, well, look. Its half-five already.

You gotta get the next one in by midnight.

You have to pick someone.

On your last trip, did you discover what the Earth people eat?

They eat a great many of these.

They peel them with their metal knives.

Boil them for 20 of their minutes.

For fucks sake.

- Do you want the apocalypse to happen?

- Youre in the way.

They are clearly a most primitive people.

Nuclear tensions rise as talks break down and US and Soviet jets...

I was watching that.

Both superpowers possess a growing arsenal of atomic weaponry, yet given the horrific devastation any nuclear exchange would cause, its assumed the policy...

You see that?

Its manifesting.

Do you understand? This is the form its taking. This is real.

You dont have much time.

Youre the only one who can stop it.

No. No.

Dont take the piss, Nida.

No, youre not... youre not a knife person.

- Way too grabby. Cut your hands all up.

- Yeah.

Oh, I know. I know. Down there.

Yes.

Thats you. Youre a basher.

Come on, youve had the practice now.

Itll be way easier this time.

Dutch courage, eh? Thats what you need.

Where do you keep your booze?

I dont drink.

Yeah, shit, yeah.

Uh...

Well, do you want a drink?

Okay. Uh...

Ah! You see... you see her with the pints?

She went on holiday when she was 12 years old and saw her sister drown in a swimming pool.

She couldve pulled her out, but she just stood there and watched.

Fucking hell.

You could be making this up.

Ah! Okay, you see him?

About three years ago, he thought his wife was cheating on him. So, he...

Strangled her in the bath.

Are you familiar with his work?

Keith Holligan.

Its funny. It wasnt premeditated, but he did have a hard-on when he did it, so...

I always knew something would happen.

Ever since I did it,

Ive had dreams.

This is what I deserve.

I honestly did love her.

I think.

I wasnt a bad husband. I just...

Yes!

Ah, even with four minutes to spare.

Well, you cant have that lying around.

Get out before he sees ya.

Sh.

Keith?

Who are you?

No, no witnesses. Hes gotta go.

- Get out!

- I cant kill another one.

- Stay there.

- Hes seen you. You have to.

Get out of my house!

Get away!

Do it! Its him or you.

Please, please, please.

Just get out of here.

Please, please

Im so sorry.

Im so sorry.

Im so sorry.

Come on, lets go.

Who was he?

Thatd be Keiths brother, Chris.

What was he like?

You know stuff.

Was he a good person or a bad person?

He was... ordinary.

I know. I know. I know.

Its not what you wanna hear, but, you know...

...whats done is done.

And on the plus side, you scored two tonight.

That one a day is just a minimum, but two does get you over the line.

You done it.

Hey, look.

See, it, um...

It...

Just... just two secs.

Hi there. Gaap of Misophaes.

Yeah.

Yeah, so, uh,

Ive got a talisman circa 1926, but the rune face just failed to register one of the sacrifices.

Yeah, two kills, but only ones been recorded.

Right.

Um, I mean, yeah, but...

What? We... we...

What, we cant just...

No.

Yeah, yeah. I get it. I get it.

- Keith didnt count.

- What?

- Why?

- Hes a murderer.

Makes him ineligible.

Thats what theyre saying.

But weve been picking people who deserve it.

Youre not strictly supposed to do it that way. I just...

I thought youd find it easier.

I mean, the first bloke, the one by the canal, theyre giving us that one cause hes never actually killed anybody, but...

What about what he did to his daughter?

You said she kills herself at 28, thanks to him.

Yeah, but thats in the future.

Im sorry.

Look, basically, anyone whos already been directly responsible for the death of another human being, theyre off-limits.

Once thats happened, as far as my boss is concerned, theyre playing for the home team.

You know, were actually lucky that Keiths brother turned up just before midnight.

It wouldve been Armageddon otherwise.

Look, you did well.

Oh, absolutely go fuck yourself!

Right up a tree!

- This is all right for you.

- It isnt.

No blood on your hands.

Youre just watching.

Light entertainment.

If the apocalypse does come, youll have a big fun finale.

- Thatd be upending the whole place...

- Its frowned upon. You get told off.

If I fail my initiation...

Kicked out of demon school? Boo-hoo.

- More like cast out.

- Whatever.

Cast out into a boundless, cosmic void.

And doomed to spend eternity in a vacuum of infinite nothingness.

Absence of matter, of time, of space, light, and sound.

I would endure a profound, palpable, and ever-present lack of existence, alone in perpetuity, forever more.

Sounds like my life.

To be honest, Im scared.

So one more victim, then.

Yeah, only thing for it.

- I cant be doing a total innocent.

- Its just murderers we have to avoid.

You mean people like me.

My whole life,

I never wished harm on anyone.

I didnt.

Uh...

You couldnt have summoned me for my trial if you hadnt.

Well, you had to be corruptible, not beyond corruption.

You know what? You must have had some dark force inside you when you touched the talisman.

Theres no shame in it.

No, go on. Who pissed you off?

So Im thinking just lure her down to the basement on some pretense, clock her on the stairwell, and say she lost her step and fell.

Snap out of it.

You can deal with the kid out there.

Needs black shoes for a funeral.

They pulled her dad out of the canal.

Id do it myself, but she gives me the willies.

Well, she... she... shes not in mourning.

Well, shes... shes not not mourning.

Happy its finished. Sad hes dead. It...

But... it has finished.

You... you spared her another five years of it.

A lifetime of therapy, but a lifetime, nonetheless.

Shes a mum at 29. A nan at 57.

Eh?

I just thought youd like to know.

Its a good fit.

And, of course, the final touch.

- Colin, really? You...

- No, no, no, no, no.

- I insist. Too late.

- Very well.

Here we are in footwear.

This is Mr. Michael Smart.

You probably recognize him.

Hes all set to be our next MP.

Well, with a little luck and a following wind.

- His father and I were at school together.

- Fuck me.

Hes been using my weekend cottage as a base of operations.

You can tell hes ex-military.

Michaels got a big speech tonight at the town hall.

I promised him a new suit and new shoes.

The finest that Possetts has to offer.

On the house.

Ive told him hell go out of business at this rate.

Fuck me some more.

Well, I said Id leave you in the hands of our finest assistant, so, um...

Vicky, if you could take care of Michael.

Michael, enjoy Vickys more than capable hands.

- Hey, steady on there. Steady on.

- Wont you walk this way?

Ill walk however you want.

For Christs sake, theres boxes all over the floor.

Would you pick up your bloody mess?

Im thinking car park later.

Wait till he comes out. Reverse into him.

Pin him up against the wall.

Keep the pedal down till you hear the stomach pop.

Eh? What do you think?

- I wont tell if you dont.

- What?

I hope

I have your vote this week.

Afraid not. National Front for me.

Oh!

Why is that?

Dont like how things are changing around here.

Mm.

My aunt, shes been in Cheetham 20 years.

Now shes got them living either side.

Thats whats next.

Weve not got a pot to piss in, so why should we share with them who dont belong?

You think voting National Front will help?

I think theyll stand up for us.

Says so right on the front of their leaflet.

But they wont get elected.

- They might.

- Theyre too overt.

People feel its, um, bad manners.

You know why I dont print

"stop immigration" in gigantic letters on my campaign literature?

Because look at me.

Look at me!

You know what I stand for.

So, do I have your vote?

Yes, sir.

Good girl.

So, who are you gonna kill, your boss or Vicky? You havent got long.

Whats his future? Michael Smart?

- Uh, it...

- Can you show me his future?

- Yeah, but lets not...

- Then show me right now.

Or Ill run out there, confess to everything, and then its over, and then youre fucked.

Show me.

16,472 votes.

Not just different, theyre inferior.

...expelled from the Tories,

Michael Smart launched his new Britannia party.

The rivers of blood are here!

Reclaim your power.

The land is ours.

In a shock victory,

Britain has a new prime minister.

Fifth columnist traitors.

Ive seen whats coming.

Rising seas, burning sky.

We are at war.

Hes fucking Satan.

No, hes not one of ours, not literally.

I mean, they do like him.

Theyre fans of his work, you might say.

Hes got to go.

- Hes next.

- Oh, uh, they are not gonna like that.

Just avoid murderers.

You said that was the one rule.

Right, but hes responsible for an impressive number of juicy deaths...

Not yet he isnt.

Right, but he... he... he beats his wife.

- Hasnt killed her, though, has he?

- I mean...

I mean, he killed a dog with a rock when he was 12.

Animals dont count.

That was one of the first things you said.

- Does Michael Smart qualify or not?

- Well, technically, yeah, but...

Then I choose Michael Smart.

Hes the one. Thats that.

Honestly, they are not gonna like it.

But its within the rules, so they can lump it.

Its him or no one.

I mean it.

Do you want to fail your initiation, hm?

He wants to try an 11.

Hurry up. Its gone closing time.

Stools there. Do it yourself.

Well, we know

Keith was no angel, for sure.

Hmm.

Did any of our lot turn that on?

I dont think so.

Keith Holligan?

Aye, he were in last night.

Hes in most nights.

Anything unusual about him?

Well, he killed his wife.

I mean, last night.

Was he behaving differently?

Just his usual self, such as he is.

Sat on his perch dragging his pints out.

Left around closing time.

- Anyone follow him out?

- Not that I saw.

Well, thanks for your time, Bob.

There were one thing last night.

I mean, she didnt speak to Keith.

- Who didnt speak to Keith?

- This Indian lass. Never been in before.

Drank two triple scotches by herself.

We dont get many of em in here, let alone ordering whiskey.

- Can you describe her?

- Yeah, Indian.

You mentioned that.

Thats all that stood out.

Bit shorter than you, maybe.

Julie, did you see her?

Sat over there.

- Saw her talking to herself.

- Talking to herself?

Sort of muttering.

Seen her in town.

Works in shoes at Possetts.

Cheers, Bob.

After Smarts finished his speech at the Town Hall, hes got to head for the cottage, which is here.

So whichever way he goes, hes out in the country.

So Im thinking I wait outside the hall in the car. I follow him along the...

- What if hes not alone?

- Is he gonna be alone? You tell me.

- Well, yeah, but...

- Well, then all I have to do is...

Some people, eh?

Im gonna paint over it.

Nida Huq?

Len Fisher, Tipley Police.

Im just making some routine inquiries.

Do you mind if I have a word?

Yeah, sure.

I mean, yes.

Inside?

Invite him in, and then kill him.

Yeah.

- Would you like a cup of tea?

- Oh, no need. I wont keep you.

Well, like I say, its just routine.

Okay.

Were you in the pub last night?

The Three Crowns?

Yeah, I was.

Regular, are you?

- I wouldnt say that.

- How often are you in there?

To be honest, last night was the first time.

First time.

God, its just... its just around the corner, isnt it?

Well, I dont drink. Not usually.

But you did last night.

Yesterday was Mums birthday.

Shes not with us anymore.

You know, its not...

Not easy.

No.

And Im not meant to drink.

I dont have it in the house or anything, but...

Im not proud of myself.

Im not here to judge.

We all need to let off steam every now and then.

Thank you.

Whats all this about anyway?

Well, youve probably heard about Keith and Chris Holligan.

- Who?

- The Holligans. Keith and Chris.

Ive not heard of them, Im afraid.

Well, Keith was actually in the Three Crowns last night.

Did you see him?

Maybe.

I wouldnt know him.

Well, I only ask because...

Looks like you served him at work a few days ago.

Did I?

Those are your initials, arent they?

Must have served him, then.

We get so many in the door.

To be honest, by the end of the day,

I hardly recognize myself.

So, you didnt see him?

I certainly didnt notice him.

So sorry I wasnt more help.

Well, if anything does come to you, please let us know.

Well, youre a total fucking liar, int ya?

Im impressed.

- He didnt buy it though.

- Best hurry, then.

Smart will be finishing his speech.

That cop is following us.

It really would be an easy kill.

He was gonna have a heart attack next year anyway.

Its not like he has any family.

No ones gonna miss him.

And together with the threat to freedom, there is a sense of helplessness.

A sense that our once great nation has fallen behind, lost its way, lost its identity.

But it is not too late, and we are not helpless.

This election may decide our fate.

Well, that fate is ours to decide.

So dont just hope for a better future.

Vote for one!

Fantastic. Fantastic.

Great night. Thank you.

Oh, thank Karen for the quiche.

- Hey, great speech. Good luck.

- Oh. Thank you.

- Ive got a good feeling about this.

- I... I do hope so.

Well, uh, off for my beauty sleep.

Oh, of course, yeah.

The bloody hell you up to, love?

Bollocks.

- Its not too late to find someone else.

- Oh, shut up!

Im just saying itd be much easier for me if you found someone else...

If youre not gonna help, then piss off.

I mean it.

Im so sorry.

Its okay.

Its okay.

Nida?

Nida?

Youre saying you were only targeting people whove done something wrong?

Mm-hmm.

Um... except that man, um, Chris.

He just turned up.

And each time you sacrificed someone, it got registered on the talisman?

Is that right?

But they said Keith didnt count.

Which wasnt fair.

This was in your jacket pocket.

This is a talisman, yeah?

Its gone normal now.

Before, it... before, it had shapes on it that sort of changed when you looked at it.

And the demon who told you to do all this, he first spoke to you through that talisman?

Just for a moment.

I could only hear him to start with.

- Then he was actually in the room.

- What did he look like?

Like a monster at first.

Then he turned into the man from Boney M.

The man from Boney M?

Who does the dancing?

Okay.

- So, the man from Boney M tells you...

- His names Gaap.

Sorry, Gaap tells you therell be a nuclear war if you dont kill three people before May Day.

He didnt just tell me.

He showed me what itd be like.

I felt the flames.

I smelled people burning.

Not long now.

I tried to stop it.

Honest, I did.

Her minds gone, thats for sure.

Certainly what the lawyer will say.

Am I mad to feel sorry for her?

Suz, theres three men dead.

So, no matter how much sympathy you might muster for her personal situation, theres families mourning.

You hear that?

Nida?

Evening, all.

I failed.

Yeah, well, me too, so thats that.

Just got word.

They are casting me out. Eternal oblivion.

Im so sorry.

Do you wanna come with me?

What?

Thats where Ive been, checking the small print.

The rules dont cover it.

Theres another loophole, apparently.

They dont say anything about a human companion.

So, I mean, you could come with.

Into eternal oblivion?

Oh no, its much worse than that.

Its with me.
