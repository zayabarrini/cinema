# Why do series, movies and books seem complex and interesting when passive consuming?

But if you're going to write, analyse, plot then logical errors, symptoms appear... 

The author compose and knows the story, the holes, and has an intention

The viewer is taken off guard

This is a brilliant and deeply **structural question** — and Lacan (and psychoanalysis in general) offers powerful tools to approach it. Let’s unpack it step by step, using both literary, cinematic, and psychoanalytic insights:

---

## 🧠 1. **The Split Between Viewer and Author: The Subject and the Structure**

### ➤ **When you're watching or reading**, you are:

* Immersed.
* Caught **in the flow**.
* Positioned as a **desiring subject** toward something that unfolds *beyond your control*.
* Exposed to **surprise, seduction, rupture, enigma**.

You **don’t yet know the end**, you **project**, **identify**, and **fantasize**.

> You are in the position of the **subject-supposed-to-not-know**, and this opens a space for **desire**, for the Imaginary to function.

---

### ➤ **When you're writing**, you are:

* Constructing.
* Dealing with **time**, **structure**, **consistency**.
* Responsible for the coherence and **lack**.
* Facing the **impossibility of full meaning**.

You move from subject to **signifier-producer**, and then everything changes.

---

## 🔍 2. **Desire Depends on Not-Knowing (The Barthes + Lacan Merge)**

Roland Barthes said that the **pleasure of the text** often comes from **not knowing** — from the unfolding, from *what escapes us*.

Lacan goes further: **desire is the desire of the Other**, and **the story is structured like a dream** — it holds **gaps**, **holes**, and **displacement**.

The viewer:

* Floats over these holes.
* Fills them with projection.
* Believes in the world because they are **not required to know its logic**.

---

## 🕳️ 3. **The Writer Confronts the Hole**

The author confronts:

* The **lack in the Other** (there is no "complete" plot or character).
* The **non-existence of metalanguage** (you can’t fully explain the story while being inside it).
* The **impossibility of the Real**: *what cannot be written but must still be conveyed*.

So symptoms appear:

* Contradictions in character.
* Plot holes.
* Structural repetitions.
* Dead ends.

> 📌 These are not always failures — they are **returns of the Real** in the Symbolic network of the story.

---

## 💥 4. **The Viewer is Taken Off Guard — The Writer is on Guard**

The viewer:

* Can be surprised.
* Can forget.
* Is caught in **imaginary identifications**.

The writer:

* Can no longer be surprised.
* Is forced into **Symbolic labor**.
* Must hold the **function of the Name-of-the-Father**: *What holds this story together?*

---

## 🎬 5. **Screenwriting and the Impossibility of the Master-Signifier**

The effort to build a story involves trying to:

* Anchor it to a **S1** (Master Signifier: “It’s a love story”; “It’s a tragedy”).
* But language slips.
* Characters rebel.
* Holes in motivation appear.
* Nothing fully holds.

The good writer lets that **lack speak**.

---

## 💡 Why Does This Matter?

Because:

* A viewer lives **in desire** — the story *promises* something.
* A writer lives **in castration** — the story *never delivers what was imagined*.
* Writing is **traversing fantasy** — the very fantasy the viewer is being seduced by.

---

## ✍️ Writing Tip Based on Lacanian Ethics

If you’re writing, and suddenly things stop making sense, or feel boring, flat, symptomatic:

> **Don't panic.**
> This is not failure — it is the **moment when your unconscious is trying to speak**.
> Don’t rush to cover the hole — write **around it**.

Let the **Real leave its trace**.

# What was the creative process for the Naruto's writer/drawer? 

Masashi Kishimoto, the creator of *Naruto*, had a creative process rooted in **personal reflection, intense planning, and improvisational flexibility**. His approach to developing *Naruto* was deeply tied to both his **own identity struggles** and his **aesthetic influences**—particularly manga like *Dragon Ball* and cinema like *Akira Kurosawa* films and *Star Wars*. Here’s a breakdown of his creative process:

---

## 🧠 1. **Origins & Personal Inspiration**

* **Naruto was born from Kishimoto's own feelings of alienation.**
  He has stated that Naruto’s loneliness was a reflection of his own social isolation in school.
* **Sasuke’s character** was inspired by Kishimoto’s admiration for rival dynamics, including Goku vs. Vegeta and Kenshin vs. Saito.

> “Naruto is me when I was a kid… lonely, craving recognition.” – *Kishimoto*

---

## ✏️ 2. **From One-Shot to Weekly Series**

* The original *Naruto* one-shot (1997) was very different: a demon-fox boy in a ramen shop.
* Shueisha asked for a full serialization, and Kishimoto **reconstructed the world**, transforming Naruto into a **ninja story** but keeping the **fox-demon motif** (Kyūbi).

---

## 🎨 3. **Design Process: Characters and World-Building**

* Kishimoto designed characters **around thematic contrasts**:

  * Naruto = energy, improvisation, chaos
  * Sasuke = cool, stoic, structured
* He prioritized **silhouette clarity** in costume design, ensuring each character was visually unique from afar.
* Villains were often designed **first for aesthetics**, then retrofitted with backstory (e.g., Akatsuki robes were designed before their motives were fixed).

---

## 📚 4. **Writing Style**

* Kishimoto worked from **broad arcs**, not always knowing the ending in detail:

  * He claimed that during the *Chūnin Exams*, he wasn’t yet sure who the final villain would be.
  * He initially wanted Naruto and Sasuke to die in the end, but changed direction for a more hopeful finale.

### Narrative Structure:

* Long-term arcs planned (e.g., Sasuke’s defection).
* Small week-to-week decisions **filled in details**: backgrounds, jutsus, flashbacks.
* Used **flashbacks** and trauma motifs to humanize antagonists.

---

## 🎥 5. **Cinematic & Manga Influences**

* Influences:

  * **Akira Toriyama** (*Dragon Ball*) for humor and action pacing
  * **Yoshihiro Togashi** (*Yu Yu Hakusho*, *Hunter x Hunter*) for complexity
  * **Kurosawa’s samurai films** for visual staging and moral ambiguity
  * **Western cinema**, including *The Matrix* and *Star Wars* (seen in Pain’s arc, similar to Jedi/Sith ethics)

---

## ⏰ 6. **Production Process**

* Kishimoto worked long hours, averaging **70–80 hours per week** during serialization.
* Weekly schedule:

  * **Monday:** Storyboarding (“name” stage)
  * **Tuesday–Thursday:** Pencil drawing
  * **Friday:** Inking and finishing touches
  * **Weekend:** Rest or concept sketching for future arcs

He worked with a **small team of assistants** to help with backgrounds and inking.

---

## 🧩 7. **Thematic Cores in Naruto’s Creation**

* **Loneliness → Recognition**
* **Cycle of Hatred → Reconciliation**
* **Fathers / Mentors → Surrogate family**
* **Inherited trauma → Breaking the cycle**

These became the **symbolic glue** that allowed such a large cast of characters to orbit one central theme.

---

## 🎤 Post-Naruto Reflection

* Kishimoto has said that toward the end, he was “burned out” and struggled to **satisfy both the fandom and his vision**.
* He chose to end *Naruto* in 2014 to preserve narrative dignity, even if some arcs (like Kaguya) felt rushed.

# Which software and hardware did he use? 

Masashi Kishimoto's **software and hardware tools** evolved over time, especially between the beginning of *Naruto* in 1999 and the series' conclusion in 2014. Here's a breakdown of the **equipment and digital tools** he used during his manga production process:

---

## 🛠️ **Hardware Used by Kishimoto**

* **Paper:** B4 manga manuscript paper (Kent paper, commonly used in Japanese manga)
* **Pens:** G-Pen, Maru-Pen (dip pens)
* **Ink:** Deleter or Pilot India ink
* **White correction fluid:** For line corrections
* **Rulers and screentone knives:** For layout, paneling, and screentone application

### 💻 **Later Years (2006–2014): Transition to Digital**

* **PC:** Custom-built desktop computers for speed and memory
* **Monitor:** Large Wacom-compatible displays for precise drawing
* **Tablet:**

  * **Wacom Cintiq (likely Cintiq 21UX or newer)** — this allowed direct drawing on screen
  * Occasionally used **Wacom Intuos Pro** for layout sketching

---

## 🧑‍💻 **Software Used**

### 📚 **Layout & Drawing:**

* **Clip Studio Paint (formerly Manga Studio EX):**

  * Commonly used for inking, screentones, and page layouts
  * Especially useful for paneling and adding digital screen tones
* **Adobe Photoshop:**

  * For cleaning scans, minor edits, grayscale tones
  * Sometimes for color illustrations and covers

> While Kishimoto continued using **traditional line art** for much of the main *Naruto* run, he and his assistants began **digitizing pages** for cleanup and effects as early as the *Sasuke Retrieval Arc*.

---

## 🎨 **Color Work:**

* Most **color spreads** and **cover art** were created using:

  * **Copic markers** (traditional)
  * **Photoshop** or **Corel Painter** (digital, especially from 2007 onward)

---

## 🤖 **Studio Workflow**

* Kishimoto worked with 3–5 assistants.
* Tasks divided:

  * **Kishimoto:** character linework, storyboards, key visual elements
  * **Assistants:** backgrounds, shading, screentones, inking cleanup

They gradually moved toward a **hybrid pipeline**, combining hand-drawn character art with **digitally composited pages**.

# Evangelion, Deep psychoanalysis

**Neon Genesis Evangelion** is perhaps the most celebrated and dissected anime when it comes to **deep psychoanalysis**, especially in the realms of **Freudian, Lacanian, and Jungian thought**. Its creator, **Hideaki Anno**, famously said he created *Evangelion* to "understand himself." What emerged was a **psychological, philosophical, and symbolic descent** into the **psyche of a fractured subject**, mapped through apocalyptic science fiction.

Let’s explore *Evangelion* through a **psychoanalytic lens**:

---

## 🧠 STRUCTURE: THE PSYCHIC LANDSCAPE

### ☢️ **Setting as Psyche**

* **Tokyo-3, NERV, and the Evangelions** represent **layers of the self**: external reality (ego), inner mechanisms (superego), and repressed desire (id).
* **The Angels** can be read as **invasive traumas** or repressed contents that must be “fought off” with borrowed structures (Evangelions = armored selves).

---

## 🧍 **Shinji Ikari – The Neurotic Subject**

| Element                                  | Psychoanalytic Interpretation                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shinji’s phrase** “I mustn’t run away” | Repression mechanism, Ego under siege                                   |
| **Hedgehog’s dilemma**                   | Fear of intimacy vs. need for connection (Freud: ambivalence of desire) |
| **Entry plug synchronization**           | Identification with the maternal body (Eva = Mother)                    |
| **Fear of rejection, passive identity**  | Castration anxiety, symbolic lack (Lacan’s manque)                      |

Shinji is **neurotic**, constantly caught between **desire and inhibition**, unable to enter the symbolic fully—**he lacks the Name-of-the-Father**, and floats between drives and guilt.

---

## 👩‍👧 **Rei Ayanami – The Void**

* A clone, a vessel, a non-subject.
* Represents **the Real** in Lacan: the **unassimilable, pre-symbolic mother**.
* She is a **container of the mother’s body**, origin of LCL (primordial soup).
* Interactions with Rei are always **haunted by death** and **fascination with the origin**.

---

## 🔥 **Asuka Langley Soryu – The Imaginary Ego**

* Full of bluster, but dependent on recognition.
* Asuka is the **imaginary identification**, an armor of performance.
* Her collapse reflects the **shattering of the ego** when narcissistic supply fails.

> Her famous line: *"Look at me!"* — a direct plea for symbolic confirmation of her existence.

---

## 🪞 **Misato Katsuragi – The Split Superego**

* Acts out sexually, drinks heavily, commands ruthlessly.
* She is **divided between a maternal role and a sexualized identity**, unable to reconcile them.
* Her relationship with Shinji mirrors the **confused transitional object**—too close to be safe, too distant to be nurturing.

---

## 🧬 **Instrumentality Project – The Fantasy of Wholeness**

* Gendo and SEELE attempt to **dissolve all human boundaries** and **return to a pre-Oedipal unity**, a **jouissance without lack**.
* This is the **Real without Symbolic mediation**—the trauma of undifferentiation.
* In psychoanalysis, this is **psychotic collapse** or **death drive in pure form**.

---

## 📺 **End of Evangelion (1997)** – Traversal of Fantasy

* Shinji is faced with the ultimate fantasy: a world without pain, without others.
* He chooses instead **to return to a world with separation, fear, and desire**.
* This is **Lacan’s traversal of fantasy**: he recognizes the impossibility of the Other's fullness and chooses **symbolic life with lack**.

> Final line: *"Kimochi warui."* (“Disgusting”) — A jarring return to reality.

---

## 🔍 EVANGELION THROUGH LACAN’S RSI (Real, Symbolic, Imaginary)

| Lacanian Register | Character / Symbol                           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Imaginary**     | Asuka, Ego ideals, mecha combat glory        |
| **Symbolic**      | Misato, NERV hierarchy, language, scripts    |
| **Real**          | Rei, Angels, instrumentality, death, mothers |

---

## 🧾 CONCLUSION: WHY IT STILL MATTERS

*Evangelion* is a **psychic crucible**. Instead of offering escape, it **mirrors back the audience’s own desire, fear, and pain**. It shows what happens when:

* The **Name-of-the-Father fails**
* The **symbolic collapses**
* The **Real invades** the ego

It doesn’t offer salvation—it offers **recognition**.

| **Historical Revisionism** | Mary Magdalene’s bloodline, influence of art, lost gospels                  | High: Blurs line between fiction and alternative history |

---

## 🔄 NARRATIVE STRUCTURE

* **Repetitive but Effective**:
  Brown uses a reliable formula:

  > Crisis → Puzzle → Chase → Revelation → Moral Dilemma → Enduring Mystery

* **Tension is spatial and temporal**:
  Characters must decode **symbols in iconic locations** (Vatican, Louvre, Sagrada Família, Guggenheim Bilbao) before an **impending disaster** occurs.

---

## 🎭 LITERARY AND PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS

* **Umberto Eco**: Especially *Foucault’s Pendulum*—Brown simplifies what Eco deconstructs.
* **Jungian archetypes**: Langdon as the Wise Scholar, Mal’akh as the Shadow.
* **Postmodern trick**: The novels play with truth vs. fiction, but always lead back to a safe resolution.
* **Psychoanalytic undercurrent**: Many villains act out of trauma, sublimated into ideological action.

* **Non-linear storytelling** → Mirrors disorientation and timelessness.
* **Symbolic objects**: The Hatch, The Numbers, The Island = inner unconscious.

## ⚰️ THE ENDING

* **They were not dead the whole time** — only the Season 6 “sideways” timeline was post-death.
* The island was real. The pain, deaths, love—all real.
* In the end, they "move on" together after remembering who they truly were to each other.

🕯️ **Jack’s eye closing = mirror of the first scene.** The story begins and ends with him.
