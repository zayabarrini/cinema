# The Dowager Countess: Wittiest Moments To Make You Laugh | Downton Abbey

I'm so looking forward to seeing your
mother again when I'm with her I'm
reminded of the virtues of the English
but isn't she American
exactly are you saying he's justified in
stealing my possessions or do you not
believe he took them I'm saying you put
too much importance and material objects
and not enough on Justice oh
really I wonder you don't just set fire
to the Abby and dance around it painted
with wood and Howling would you think I
might have a drink oh say S I thought
you were a
waiter I don't understand no if you wish
to understand things you must come out
from behind your Prejudice and listen
why must she be so Savage it's my broken
heart and it was her advice that wrecked
it in the first place classic Ros and
she's never more righteous than when
she's in the wrong why the lamentation
you don't have to see him if you don't
want what you make it sound so easy
there's nothing simpler than avoiding
people you don't like avoiding one's
friends that's the real test have you
come for dinner oh no I'm dressed quite
wrongly and I know you have a guest I
doubt Mr Travis as much of a eye for
fashion what did you keep up with them
oh I'm afraid not no an unlucky friend
is charome enough an unlucky
acquaintance is
intolerable you're all
heart if she's fighting for her causes
again that seems a good sign a sign of
what that we should close the shutters
and Bar the Door what do you mean a
man's opened to Colony in Essex not that
sort of colony mamama it's for people
who want to take all their clothes off
in
Essex isn't it terribly damn would that
make a difference oh yes if you had no
clothes well I think it's a mad
idea oh really it's like living in a
second rate hotel where the guests keep
arriving and no one seems to
leave do you think Robert has thrown in
the towel prematurely
good Heavens what am I sitting on uh
swivel chair oh another modern brain
wave not very modern they were invented
by Thomas Jefferson why does every day
involve a fight with an American I'll
fetch a different one no no no no I'm a
good sailor Mary won't take Matthew
Crawley so we'd better get her settled
before the bloom is quite gone off the
roads is the family an old
one older than yours I imagine if I'm
going to the theer then I ought to
change yes I
should Sprat I have told you before I do
not appreciate a man of mystery if you
have something to say say it there's no
logic in it oh no but if I were to
search for logic I should not look for
it among the English upper cloths I was
only going to say that cibil is entitled
to her opinions no she isn't until she
is married than her husband usband will
tell her what her opinions are oh cranny
you see I have no wish to be a great
lady no a decision that must be
reinforced whenever you look in the
glass how did they survive as servants
and taxi drivers Millers and prostitutes
anything they could lay their hand to I
will not suggest which of those callings
the princess kuragan was most sued well
it is very hard you're addressing your
mother not the committee of the woman's
Institute I can take you for a walk if
you like why would I want to
walk poor Dr Clarkson oh what has he
done to deserve that
termagant well shall I'll pretend it I
told her to take him your quarrel is
with my daughter rosand not me so put
that in your pipe and smoke
it would happen to a foreign was typical
don't be
ridiculous I'm not being ridiculous no
Englishman would dream of dying in
someone else's house sorry but if Dr
Clarkson needs Free Labor I'd prefer him
not to find it in my Nursery but cibil
isn't in the nursery no in case you had
noticed she hasn't been there for some
time you know what I mean well no not
really you can't pretend it's not
respectable when every day we're treated
to pictures of queens and princesses in
red cross uniform ladling soup down the
throat of some unfortunate but CA won't
be ladling soup she'll have to witness
unimaginable Horrors when she's an
innocent her innocence will protect her
yeah for once I agree with cousin
Isabelle what's this Edith has had an
invitation to write a newspaper
column when may she expect an offer to
appear on the London stage I'm studying
my lady These Days A working woman must
have a skill but you you seem to have so
many think of the child you cannot want
your only granddaughter to grow up in a
garage with that drunken
gorilla she looks like a oh heavens
that's not a word you often hear among
the Heather shall I change no don't
bother it's only us and who are we to
Warrant any courtesy I really think you
should go to bed no bride wants to look
tired at her wedding either means she's
anxious or been up to no good I won't
sleep a wink tonight or tomorrow civil
vulgarity is no substitute for wit well
you started
it we'd better go in without her or it's
not fair on Mrs patmore oh is her
cooking so precisely timed you couldn't
tell this room is so pretty has the
house always been the painswick London
home there's no always about the pain
wigs my dear they were invented from
scratch by my son-in-law's grandfather
father we bought the house when we were
married you make Mr painswick sound
rather a rough diamond lady Grom maduk
wasn't a rough diamond was he mama no he
was just cut and Polished comparatively
recently why don't I drive you she's
taking enough chance with her life as it
is oh granny well I'm going up to London
to stay with Rosman for a day or two I
think we'll have levinia for tea you
sound as if you're going to gobble her
up if any we could
I've left space at the front for Jewels
I know lvia is getting something from
Papa and for me though she's so slight a
real necklace would flatten
her what should we call each
other well we could always start with
Mrs Crawley and Lady Grandam I thought
you didn't like
him so what I have plenty of friends I
don't like well prepare yourself for the
worst not the first page
my poor niece never uses one word when
20 will
do sorry about the vase oh don't be
don't be it was a wedding present from a
frightful Aunt I have hated it for half
a
century I suppose you agree with Robert
then not for the first time you suppose
wrongly oh dear I'm afraid the war has
made old women of us both oh I wouldn't
say that but then I always keep out of
the sun yeah how' you find D on your
return much the same really probably too
much the same but then I don't want to
cast a PA over all the happiness how
could you ever do
that oh you two are dressed for a
barbecue and I feel like a Chicago
Bootlegger I don't even know what that
means but it sounds almost as peculiar
as you look what about me where am I to
go we still own most of the village oh
perhaps I could open a shop what you
like but I know you care about these
things as much as I do nobody cares
about anything as much as you do is this
your first experience of jazz lady
Granton oh is that what it
is do you think any of them know what
the others are
playing you'll be rewarded in
heaven the sooner the better I feel
rather guilty about leaving Isabelle
behind why she brought a book with her
that should keep her occupied how about
some House Parties she's been asked to
one next month by Lady an mcna was a
terrible idea she doesn't know anyone
under a 100 I might send her over to
visit my aunt she could get to know New
York oh I don't think things are quite
that desperate no don't worry about that
I can handle her
really well if you can you must have
learned to very recently please don't
think we're ungrateful for your
enthusiasm Mrs Crawley but
there comes a time when things are best
left of the
professionals is it an Irish tradition
what she means not changing of course it
isn't granny it might have been you
didn't change on the first night of a
voyage are you going up to the house to
welcome the Queen of Sheba oh I think so
rosand has no interest in French if she
wishes to be understood by a foreigner
she shouts that's not fair I think she's
splendid
I think she's
cracked oh what on Earth the matter I'm
leaving in the morning lady Grom I doubt
we'll meet again do you
promise can I do it if you wish my lady
of course I don't know are you are you
ready that all yes my
lady thought you might have been walking
on stills
for


# Maggie Smith Moments That Make Me Spit Out My Tea | Downton Abbey


if we don't respect the past we'll find
it harder to build our future why did
you read that I made it up I thought it
was rather good it's too good the one
thing we don't want is a poage in the
family would it be so
bad the only poet Pier I am familiar
with is Lord Byron and I presume we all
know how that ended what do you mean I
think cousin Robert is referring to
Ethel's work as a prostitute
well of course these days servants are
very hard to find you're plotting
something I see a melan look in your eye
ma is frequently
underrated he had many qualities so did
Caligula not all of them Charming civil
vulgarity is no substitute for wit well
you started
it don't be silly this won't make any
difference to all that she won't want to
get involved when you talk like that I'm
tempted to ring for Nanny and have you
put to bed with no
supper I would like M to see your father
as the son she never had will she be the
mother I never had sarcasm is the lowest
form of wit you've been to Russia none
of us have did you get to know any when
you were there oh yes so
yes what did you keep up with them oh
I'm afraid not no an unlucky friend is
terome enough an unlucky acquaintance is
intolerable you're all heart Larry gray
has spoken to Mrs Crawley in a manner
that in any other Century would have
resulted in him being called out and
shot I can't believe it was as bad as
that then you are misinformed is anyone
coming seems bitter to miss such a good
pudding
yes yes the
minister well how many marises of fler
out
there is this an instrument of
communication or
torture
hello
shrimpy it's un
Violet very well
very and
Susan
good good I w't beat about the poster
whom might we know on the board of leads
General
infirmary some man has opened a nudest
colony at Wickford and Essex it's called
the manella group what do you mean a
man's open to Colony in Essex not that
sort of colony mamar it's for people who
want to take all their clothes off in
A6 isn't it terribly Dam but that make a
difference well yes if you had no
clothes S I think it's a mad idea
there's nothing simpler than avoiding
people you don't like avoiding one's
friends that's the real test would you
think I might have a drink oh I'm so
sorry I thought you were a
waiter in my day a lady was incapable of
feeling physical attraction until she'd
been instructed to do so by her mama I
don't believe that seriously my dear you
have to take control of your
feelings before they take control of
you and I'm afraid you're dislike it but
she says that she and Tom Branson have
agreed to
correspond dislike it I will lick the
stamps myself now Mrs
Crawley tells me that you paid her a
visit when you first came that you were
amazingly friendly well I hope I'm
always friendly nobody's always friendly
the mother is Keen they should take the
matter to court well you can't blame her
why if her husband wanted me to have the
place who we to argue you never thought
to turn it down do I look as if I turn
down a villa in the south of
France I suppose she has an appropriate
costume for every
activity Tom has been the victim of a
cruel prank which I know you will all be
kind kind enough to forget forgive
perhaps forget never oh you two are
dressed for a barbecue and I feel like a
Chicago Bootlegger I don't even know
what that means but it sounds almost as
peculiar as you look you want me to tell
you why he did it when the truth is I do
not
know and with that I will say good night
and leave you to discuss my mysterious
past you owe your place to Mrs Crawley
she would not let me go until I'd
promised she would not relax her grip
you make me sound very fervent Wars have
been waged with less F well let's hope
we win this one if we can show the
county he can behave normally they will
soon lose interest in him and I shall
make sure he behaves normally because I
shall hold his hand on the radiator
until he
does I'm a feeble substitute for the
entire Crawley
family yes but you're better than
nothing how warming you make that sound
really granny how can you say that I'm
too worldly but cibil's not worldly
enough you cannot be so contrary I'm a
woman Mary I can be as contrary as I
choose
