# Kim Spradlin

love have women's dirty panties touching
the skin on my forehead
okay good things about me amazing cat
Chelsea's not fine we're good alright
I didn't plan to form an alliance right
off the bat I was just think the last
night that we stuck to our guns a little
bit after tribal and didn't run over and
dump in the men's shelter but going over
there this morning
I have no shame I've been so miserable
I couldn't get my chill over there to
that fire fast enough nobody really had
the girls Idol and something snapped for
me and I thought I'm literally gonna get
up and go find this right now it's out
here somewhere
the immunity is really really good I
just
come off the slide nice week this has
been my thing Lola I'm trying to keep my
options open
so if sticking with the girls works best
for me in the long run I'll stick with
the girls and if we get to the merge and
we don't have the numbers
Troi and J my alliance all the way I
can't get over how this could not have
gone any better for me and how much fun
I'm having doing this video so much on
that Kim is now stuck just like me
incredibly unathletic fall
I don't really care either way you don't
care either way I think Jonas is a real
rude dude I mean he made the offer with
the net and then kept saying I mean I
don't care I don't care I don't care but
obviously he cares a lot another person
gone is another person gone for
tonight's boat we want to vote Jonas out
since he's the biggest threat and we
want to keep Christina and elysia around
just in case we wind up meeting a girl's
alliance to get a guy out and
particularly one of the new Manono tribe
members that leaves the girls in the
majority it leaves my old Salani tribe
in the majority and gives me two really
great options where's that axe that we
got the first member of our jury
Jonas your name we pray they may be
offended if I take a bite of this
absolutely totally just say Mike is
trying to get you out of here you're 12
we got your boy back look we gotta get
my dad here he's gonna start a
recognition more than gogo is here so
long they're not doing anything I could
get rid of Mike six crossing forwards
and we just violator the girls are
already in the majority so if we can get
a united front and come together we
could start sending these guys home I'm
gonna have to be careful Troy I just
thought you should know that Mike is
subtly planning the speed and lots of
people's minds if you're going to win
and that like we can't let you make it
that long and I just feel like we gotta
get back out of here that pisses me off
troyzan and I went this morning in the
rain to get tree mail and I told them
the whole story about hey yesterday Mike
was kind of thrown your name out there I
think we need to take Mike out first and
then we'll take out the girls I hate
that guy so I just a few the community
multiply environment I'm using try to
send Mike home tonight my concern is if
Jake finds out what's really going on
Jay I think about gonna like be on y'all
girls apparently Chelsea literally sat
there in the shelter in front of the two
girls that are not supposed to be a part
of our alliance and asked Jay to vote
for Mike that's asinine hopefully we can
just be really cool about it don't get
panicky no just I just went off for a
walk Mike's gonna explode this camp um
it's in Towson I'm going oh
provides a check this out who's sitting
back there
chocolate pop quiz do Christina and
that's four more round that we can all
go y'all do not have to worry about them
I walked up he's literally about to tell
Mike and I look at him like don't you
dare so we got a myriad I'm just saying
something's going to be different after
tonight and so
right now is decide if we're gonna like
lay down tonight and vote Christine
offered we're about to make our move
because this is never gonna be the same
if we do this
somebody's been very good at deceiving
that's what it means if where's that
accident eighth person voted out the
second member of our jury Mike my hope
all along has been that everybody will
think I'm just kind of calm and
soft-spoken and maybe a little
forgettable and not calling the shots
but I do think at the end of the game if
I can sit there with the three I do
think the people on the jury will know
that I was making most of these
decisions who do you trust
I just forget that I was on board for
this year was that cool yes Jade told us
all that he thought Alesia should go
home tonight and we all just nodded and
agreed and said yes but that's
definitely not happening
Christina Alesia and Tarzan who vote for
Jay and Lise myself
Chelsea Sabrina and Kat will vote for
Troy
to worry about no crazy Nessman is
definitely squared I'm gonna fly sign me
I'm gonna go like my frickin survivor
experience sucks we're good I'm ready to
draw the line like it's been muddy for
long enough and I feel like it's time
for the guys to know where the women
stand I think
I have an idol girl I'm playing
I want the person to go home
one thing the lights playing enjoy my
guitars and a vote for Cameron
kiss Chino vote for Kim you vote for Kim
who are you voting for
he's over there switching votes right
now he's trying to get Tarzan and
Christina to vote you and he asked me
about for you and I said I'm sticking
with you Lucia because if you all vote
for him and he plays that Idol the next
four votes are coming your way
Jay just put the fear of God in me Troy
does have an idol he's planning to play
it and he's planning to send me home
John Don John Luke where's that accident
the third member of our jury
Jay when power spend your cash in clever
ways
hunger will be side lot mowing path
naked woman in a town now has chocolate
and peanut butter it's all Haiti the
survivor auction is officially not
moving we know what winning feels like
in the reward feels like you want to
keep doing it oh my god lot moaning joy
damn wins immunity
who knows what he can pull off he's a
really smart guy so hopefully we can get
rid of him before he does something too
crazy that sends me home you can go from
getting voted out tonight Tarzan getting
voted out tonight Leif getting voted out
tonight to automatically guarantee
yourself to be at five if they would
vote Kim out that's all it would take
Dom Dom DOM Newt Kim you're a fantastic
player and probably the best girl here
Kim where is that accident the fourth
member of our jury leave tribal was
really interesting tonight
Troy throwing my name out definitely
throws me a curveball in this game like
I was not planning on being a target so
early on lot moaning where's that axe
the pig coming into camp is awesome for
me right not for extension and I can
already feel like walls coming down that
big is cute
I'm sorry I'm not killing that big
where's that accident the fifth member
of the jury
Troy it's really good that Troy is fun
I like physically feel relieved I feel
like who would you trust with your life
kim says herself correct answer was Kim
Kim got herself right oh yeah
so if I win I can pick him and if she
went she could pick me sorry Chelsea are
you serious oh my god I'm gonna cry I
freaking hate that if we just play
everyone else's worry about that right
okay the reward was awesome but I can't
decide if I'm enjoying it or not we're
gonna have to do some damage control of
our lives when you get back new things
compact me all right
do not mean that I'm furious I know
everybody here thinks of me is a
follower ass player like Christina
because of that pick the right Heidi for
me today either this is my where stay
out here and it shouldn't be and I'm I'm
not throwing myself a pity party I'm
just telling you this is literally the
worst thing that's happened to me since
this game started as I won this freaking
challenge today you know I think my
choice did not choose Kat today was the
first decision that I have made that was
not strategic and I think I'm paying for
it now here's your sister Beth Ken good
job even though Kim didn't choose Kat
last time Kat is choosing Kim this time
I don't think Alisa will get many
but she's delusional about that in cat
well he's old investment the day with
these two and they don't think we're a
threat that's how dumb they are job is
not them they're dumb dumb dumb dumb
I've just decided at this point if I can
take every immunity from here on out I
will
does it kill wins immunity yeah wins her
second individual immunity hey high five
minutes help
dum-dum-dum news
I mean it's lose to someone who's 28
years old who's 6 years older than me
like how embarrassing is that
please come
oops
pick on cash
I want to easier win I can't keep going
up again cat you know what I'm saying
sure the sixth member of our jury
cat that's four that's enough need to
bring me your torch gonna come down to
the wire kept drops one is free
chemistry Kym's dizzy yeah I mean I
think it's just my heart like it does
get in the way is that a song I have
been playing both sides Alesia Tarzan
and Christina all think that I make a
foursome for them and then Chelsea and
Sabrina think I am their third as much
as you think that I can win this game I
think total ops I think that much as we
can
and you're going to thanks for justing
you've played this game better than
anyone else out here and I'm lucky that
you and I developed a friendship that we
had each other's backs I feel the same
way I feel better about the option of
going with Chelsea and Sabrina I'm just
trying to figure out any way possible
that we can somehow to win this next
boat with three boats like the thought
of that makes me cringe I think the only
reason ELISA would be willing to give up
Tarzan who has appeared to be one of her
minions as if she's convinced that he's
not a minion after all he's the
mastermind who's trying to take out her
mastermind Kim with her angelic eyes
actually full troyzan and jaybird so god
knows she could probably pull Alicia I'm
gonna convince the jury to go through
seeing you told me that but to me he's
playing us yeah imprison she's gonna
take Chris he's gonna take Christina and
I'm I see myself if I didn't realize
this I would got straight-up Tarzan I
would look like an idiot in front of
everybody
we're taking Tarzan out iTunes
and Christina that Tarzan is trying to
take you and Christine I'm not getting
like listen they're floored there is
excited to take him out as they were to
take Kat out I swear
so another Kim has finagled her way into
Lucy's mindset that Tarzan is gunning
for Alicia where's that accident the
seventh member of our jury Tarzan I feel
like I have all these like weapons and
my belt
yeah
camera has this amazing ability to just
look at you almost look through you and
say yeah I'm with you
I definitely feel confident that Kim is
100% loyal to me I got this I'm choked
where's that axe Alecia need to bring me
your torch
awesome yeah
and a guaranteed spot at the final
Tribal Council
the fourth time in this game won
individual immunity we have dominated
the individual portion of this game
yeah I'm sorry that's guys whoa
the ninth and final member of our jury
Christina
I know I lied you
but no boobs laughs absolutely I see I
strategized until I was blue in the face
and I'm proud of the way that I played
it strategically I don't know how I
could have done it any better if
everybody votes for the person that they
think like the best game that I can sit
here with these two guys and I'll win
the winner of Survivor
all right baby but uh


# Kristie Bennet

that is true you never know who could win this game every one of you have an
equal chance enough said we're all a
bit Bo massive wave just wipes out the whole Camp traditionally I don't really
like the idea of just going with a Women's Alliance because you have the same anatomy and de the tribe has spoken
my back this game is a lot harder than people think if you don't have eyes in
the back of your head you all going home it's awfully convenient that my teach are missing my bag there's a pretty
strong rigid Alliance going on which is pretty clear and they're playing all sort of dirty little tricks they think
I'm an idiot but I can see it from a mile away
I know every single person on that tribe is in an alliance together and they're
absolutely doing everything to get me out like
next oh this is my bag
hang no christe you all right mate no mate all right they just took it they've
been taking and stealing things and like just trying to either rant me up or like
just get me so pissed off that I
quit where is Christie is it your dream yeah it it
genuinely is like yeah like I've literally been watching this show yeah
forever forever and I literally told my dad that I was going to get on it one
day and like when you want something yeah so badly like you get really caught
up in it yeah I'm not going to give up because I'm here for that 8-year-old
girl who told her dad that she was going to win Survivor that's why I'm here yeah
christe's in a really interesting situation cuz she can see that Dez didn't fit in she's probably looking at
herself going hey I don't fit in Evan the tribe has
spoken are a you know a United group you know the fact that we can all go home
back to camp tonight we can just work it out and move forward together but you
will not be voting tonight it's this awkward situation
where everybody was Voting off cat cat didn't go home now this four Girl
Alliance has has like a broken leg and how do you mend a leg that you're going
to amputate and embrace the pose I feel like I'm thriving more in the game than
when I started which is good cuz if things are getting better it's better than them getting
worse I'm under the impression that I'm in a tight neck alliance with Phoebe and
L but I'm not sure if Phoebe l
Rowan and Lee are in a tighter Alliance it still doesn't really fully sit well
with me I just got to plant some seeds in some mines just slow yeah just slow
you're right Christy slow and steady for aganoa they had a huge lead they're
losing the lead now Christy is still very slow over an agola don't tell me to
go any quicker
poly it was sitting right there his sneakers were drying next to the fire
and somehow they just caught a light got to crack a smile at
highly aware that I am not in any sort of majority at
all there's going to have to be some fancy work going on for any agonite to move
forward you touch your toes at the back and lift them up oh wow I'm just trying
to be a likable person hey not a lot of people can
do that was good what about you Christie where do you fit are you within
the majority or the minority well we're going to have to say
Rowan the tribe has spoken wow we could had four now we're all on the
bottom I have a Ferrari in my brain and the rest are driving H ey
excels smoothly Andy came up at the well out of nowhere Andy just appears
conveniently what are you serious yeah where got
two my life if you can show me it Andy is a rat he's pops out a nowhere at the
drop of a hat you're a Super Fan that's not offering
anything eighth person voted out for an Australian Survivor
cat cat the tribe has spoken Andy is the type of person who if
you write his name down he's going to be gunning for you next but Andy is the only person I'm interested in getting
voted out B she's in the water Conor's trying to hold her up you got it yeah I got
him Phoebe and myself were having the chat about getting Andy out and seeing
if Kate was on board with that idea and she really was she was almost more
passionate about it than we were are you in the minority or the majority tonight oh who knows you don't know so
is the majority hopefully yeah that's three votes Andrew three
votes Christie ninth person voted out from Australian Survivor Andrew need to bring me your
torch Andrew the tribe has spoken fortunately that's why I'm
sitting here tonight you have to be really sad I'm going to be really sad too you're losing me yeah know be
devastated does she know yeah thanks for being honest with me guys and
set how you going really good how are you that's good how are you I'm good I
had some tears just before oh
good I can confirm that this is in fact a hidden immunity idol so any votes cast against Phoebe
will not count Craig the tribe has spoken I
haveing they
we may have lost whatever the reward is but I think we deserve a
treat snail I'm going to eat you for dinner we're having esar go for dinner
never had it before even though I did live in France but why not start with the raw real thing I'm excited
I don't feel safe about what's going to happen tonight I've been through an emotional roller coaster I started this
game with having like almost a
breakdown in front of everybody and I've been trying to work
on that every day that I've been here and it's really really hard
tonight one of you will be leaving this
tribe but you will not be leaving the game Sue I want you to take your buff
off cuz you no longer need it toss it in the fire you're now officially part of SAU so leaving to go over to SAU makes
me feel a little bit relieved because I had a feeling that I was going to be voted out tonight well I want to have a
trat with Kate do not let getting
you why is she so desperate to not have me be seded it's just a bit
unusual okay we're going trust each other I do have trust in Phoebe but in
the back of my mind I'm always a little bit Angy about
her so in my head I'm thinking no I don't like this I don't want to go along
with that so I want to see what's going on because my instincts was screaming
that I was going home last night screaming at
absolutely was going to vote for me last night she called out my
name to hear that Phoebe had been gunning for me and that she was going to vote for me the last Tribal Council and
all the interactions we had had in between that it was like you
ain't going to
happen sorry babe you got to go but she knows that we
the threat she said to me let's just okay
yeah she's ready to throw me under the bus the best move for you isn't going to
be somebody who wants to throw their best friend on the L I need to make sure that she still
thinks that we're working together okay okay
yeah baby thought that she had me I'm not this girl that people can just drag
along I'm somebody who knows the game is prepared to play it and what better move
is there then take out one of the biggest players in this game phebe thought that she could play
me but you know what I could play her better what are you basing your vote
on intuition can you be any more specific
no what she got telling you it gave me a really really strong realization that
I'm going to follow which was what I can't go into details of that right
now Phoebe the tribe has spoken and by blindsiding
Phoebe Phoebe she removed one of the game's most dangerous strategists I've
noticed a couple of people are wearing pink bracelets that could be potentially another sign of potential alliances
Christy's wearing one though oh that's cute cute as a button
salmon you're going to take one hand off I said you going to give me food I'm
really at an indecision right now and I'm feeling a little bit vulnerable
I'm trying to fit in with a majority and try and stay in this game otherwise they're going to turn against me and
it's hard because we are really good
friends you could go through this whole game being a floater it just means that
you can flow through and navigate and change directions without the same inura
that you would have if you were in Alliance Connor Kate the tribe has spoken
well you can give yours up today for someone else if that's what you want to
do that's what I want to do because I know what mine would say
and I know that other people really need it and I know what's in mine so I want to give mine to
Matt all right you can swap places with Matt
so much it's okay that's so nice of you and just like that Nick Kylie the tribe
has spoken L and Le conversation
every four votes Christie four votes Sue 16th person voted out of Australian
Survivor third member of our jury sue sue
the tribe has spoken I know it's not fun to be the other vote I
got four votes tonight uh but you know what I got fire now and I am not going to let anybody
push me around I'm not putting up with that
Now's the Time to actually be playing it wasn't time before but now it
is every time I have a conversation with
Lee I feel like he's almost sacrificing himself for me to get further in the
game it's it's really
worried that I'm going to be going but learning how to sit in a vulnerable position
and still make it through is the best way for me to move forward and Louise
the tribe has spoken who would have thought little
chrisy from agano has made it to the top seven um
somehow no I know exactly how I've gotten here by playing an independent
game and fitting into other people's
plans this is the time for things to
change time for the ice queen to step off your self-proclaimed throne goodbye Brooke
the tribe has spoken we just agreed that we would vote
Christy out if it came to that and as we were talking about
that Christy came up right afterwards I've said I will stick to an alliance to
four with lee l and flick but when you see your alliance having a conversation
without you it puts alarm bells in your mind I've been making people believe
that they're in control of me since the day I arrived here Phoebe Sue Brook
there are a lot of people who fell victim to thinking that they had control
of me having a CH about this morning what when you guys came down to the beach earlier
ah I don't know just last night we wanted to check in with each
other um something doesn't feel right and I I thoroughly believe in my gut
instinct something's going to change I'm not having that
hello BB oh yeah no I went to the toilet and then I had a drink and saw medic
okay I thought that you might have been something she has no
idea whereas if we had to stayed with l l worst night of my life
seriously I really don't know what's the best
decision both options are strategic options and I'm having
anxiety about it all
game is just getting to me and it's getting to me I just don't want
to compromise who I am I just said and I feel like I
have to outwit our play and Outlast I need to figure out what the best option is for me Sam the tribe has spoken I
have flick and Matt have taken their stand and that's where they are and Le
and L have taken their down and that's where they are and I am in the
middle which means I'm in full
control go figure if I don't want to do something I'm not going to stand there and take it if my dad was here he would
say be yourself back yourself make your own decisions Christie and do what you think is right and that's what I intend
on doing M the tribe has spoken
the title of Soul Survivor is seriously at stake for me right now big time oh my
God where where's the look
at stop it a party in your mouth everybody is invited to that party yeah
it's just everything
I'm going to do everything I can to
survive christe she's having no trouble walking that Barrel across and if it
means then I have to win immunity tomorrow and that's what I've got to
do I'm going to fight for it I want to be here you know eighth member of our
jury flick you're idiot we'll see we will see Flick the
tribe has spoken
bye oh my
God so proud
my dream of an 8-year-old I I literally sat there next
to my dad and watched Richard Hatch in this Challenge and turned to him and
said one day I'm going to get on Survivor wow and one day I'll be there
this challenge is now on
you've got to let me have this one babe I don't want to go
home I'll take you I'll take you if you let me have this immunity I will take
you I
probably beat me I don't think I'm going to get any votes I just want to get to the
end I just want to be sitting in that final too
I guaranteed they I won't have the votes he I am I am
fighting I'm really
fting and the other reason why I would take you is because you reminded me so much
of my dad who sitting just over there and was time when I couldn't get
anywhere I couldn't do anything you always there supporting me no matter
what no matter how crazy I was I swear on my dad I swear on
everything if I can get this imunity you are making a young
8-year-old girl's dreams come true
Happy you okay christe you okay
no can you get me cuz I'm hurting
you God unel oh my God
unbelievable 1 2
three I want that's the only one you needed that's
the only one that's the only one that mattered and you knew that you have no mad yet how many times I thought I was
convinced I was gone I was convinced that I was never going to make it and I
just kept going you found a way I found a way now normally I'd call you
over but I'm going to get Dad to come over he is
the final two I won the most important necklace in this game with my dad
standing there with the most iconic challenge in Survivor history that is
something I will remember for the rest of my life and fake voted out last
Tribal Council wow oh my God
won wow guys last night you sat here at Tribal
Council and you said to me that you're going to have to win the challenge today if you're going to end up in the final
two and you did it yeah it was a pretty great moment it's a dream come true 22nd
person voted out for an Australian Survivor and the final member of our jury
l l the tribe is spoken I made it today
55 people didn't think I was going to make it but I have survived through
everything Survivor has thrown at me and I'm at the other side
boom tick cheers I do feel as though I deserve to
be the souls Survivor I've proved that you can defy all the
odds I did that and isn't that what survivor is all
about all of you you thought I was absolutely
crazy maybe I was but I've proven that every single
odd can be stacked against you in this game but if you keep going and you're determined enough you will find a way to
make it to the end phe was gunning for me I managed to
flip that around and then she went home coming in to this final merge my
goal was to ensure that I could get out everyone from
Ral and everyone from SAU and that's what happened
I have had to fight my way through 20 tribal
through two whole tribes who in Survivor can say
that I can it's not a show Pony a Survivor fan I can appreciate every
single one of you want wanting to make big moves but you look at the jury and
the people who made big moves got voted out straight away afterwards Le's kind
of you know controlled your every move
no Lee wasn't controlling me part of my game play from the
beginning was to let other people think that they had control of
me everybody wants to feel secure in this game everyone wants to feel like
they're in control and know what's going on so
really I was kind of using le as well I went through the entire game to 20
tribal councils and knew who was going home every single
time the whole essence of Survivor is breaking through that adversity and if
you can't do that where are you going to go one of you will be named Soul
Survivor but a moment like that really should be shared with people you care
about the most and this is my mom hi hi Mom hi hi I'm so proud of her I'll read
the votes
chrisy christe
Christie Christie four votes Christie one vote
Lee winner of Australian Survivor Christie
christe you are Australia's Soul Survivor
2016 I just won the title of Soul
Survivor and half a mill Survivor is the ultimate game and
the ultimate challenge you grow so much from going through an experience like
this and my life will never be the same my baby I'm living proof that if you want
something you can get it the biggest lesson that I've learned be yourself
back yourself if you have a goal that you deep down inside no feels right CL
it is right

# Parvati Shallow Australia x The World

Oh, sweet little baby all these. Think
they know how to play Survivor. They're
so cute.
I've been playing this game for decades.
For decades. This will be my fifth time
playing Survivor. Everyone else said
that I'm the most dangerous player out
here. So, I guess they're right.
The winner of Survivor fans versus fans.
So, I've won it once. I should have won
it twice. and I'm here to win it again
on the world stage.
The last time I was here in Samoa, I had
a bitter jury, so I lost by a few votes.
So, I am here to claim the win that was
meant to be mine 16 years ago. Four
internationals and three Americans out
here. We have to stay US strong until
merge. But the thing is, Tony's a loose
cannon. I don't know about Tony. Is he
going to trust me? Is he going to want
to work with me? I need to talk to you
about you and me,
okay?
Because I feel like I'm a little bit
nervous, but I've got Siri out here.
It's been over 15 years since we've
played together. That's my girl. I love
Siri. She talks out of the side of her
mouth when she's strategizing.
It's the best.
What do you think? Oh, no.
They're worried about the three of us.
I think Y, me, and Tony should try to
keep each other safe till March. My plan
is to go head over to South Africa and
talk to the Zulu King.
I tend to eat guys like Rob for
breakfast, but Rob gives me options.
I can actually get lost talking to your
beautiful eyes.
Yours are beautiful.
Rob, you're doing that to me.
The web weaving has begun.
Yeah, you stop looking at those,
Rob. And I'm like three steps ahead. I
saw Rob and David clicking at the
challenge.
I know David from another show, so I'm
thinking I can use this David connection
to build a bridge with Rob. Maybe I'm
still the Black Widow and I'll still
wrap you up in my web and suck your
blood.
Day two. And it's my birthday. I don't
think I've ever celebrated a birthday on
Survivor. This is a first for me out of
five seasons. If I stay in this game
tonight, I am tied for the most amount
of days played for Survivor ever. 152
with my boy Boston Rob. And I'm coming
for that record. I mean, I'm like I'm so
offended. I know that he's trying to
blindside me tonight. Sir, you do not
know who you're messing with. You don't.
I'm so like, you don't blindside the
queen. You don't. Is it me?
I don't know. Is it me?
Oh my god, it's me.
Y'all,
but I don't know why Rob would throw
your name.
I don't know.
Rob threw my name.
But
well, that's what I hear.
I'm aligned with Tony and Serene, with
Lisa, and with Cass. So, I think we're
going to vote Rob. This is very
interesting coming from you at this
moment after we've seen you
communicating with David multiple times
in the challenges. He comes to me
and it's been very clear that you and
want to work with David.
I know David from that game that I
played.
We played together until he threw me
under the bus.
Now we know.
That's the deal.
I'm not watching no more.
No deal island.
You tried to blindside me on my
birthday. I'm not mad. I'm just
disappointed. Poor sweet blindsided baby
Rob. That guy did not know when to keep
his mouth shut.
I tribal. The Black Widow is like a
dangerous female spider who devours the
men.
We can bring together like a really
formidable women's alliance
because we are all so different. So, if
we can like get Lisa 100%.
We can really make this happen.
Told me I would love it. Just hang a key
off a tree. Oh my god.
I got the key.
I needed something to solidify some
trust with these women to help us move
forward in the game as a solid for
luck. No,
don't.
I don't think I've ever been so
terrified in my life. I'm like a kid
with my hand caught in the cookie jar. I
am literally sitting on the box with the
lock hanging open. Please go away, Tony.
Please go away. Please don't ask me to
stand up. Please don't ask me to look at
the box.
Let me see if I'm going walk over there
and see what
found a clue to a hidden immunity idol.
But to get it, you'll need to be daring.
The idol awaits you at tribal council,
hidden at the base of Jonathan's podium.
Are you kidding me? I'm going to tear
this up.
After all of this effort, I'm expecting
fanfare, confetti, and idol to pop out.
Jonathan maybe pop out of that box. Are
you kidding me? But it's just a little
scroll. The clue to the hidden immunity
idol at tribal council.
Three women who are willing to keep my
secret a secret.
Poverty.
So now I'm sitting pretty as the person
who has the most power in this game.
David voted out the last tribal council.
They did what they did.
Wow.
The target
held my arm over my head for 6 and 1/2
hours.
6 and 1/2 hours. Pretty good,
right? We're bragging now.
What you looking at,
P? You're really strong. A beast.
Save it, George. I'm running back the
playbook for Micronia. I'm running back
the black widow over gay. Let's bring
the women together and let's keep us
strong. We know where the immunity idol
is. We're sharing it within the four
women. And also like that's why the idol
is it's like a shared idol. So whoever
needs it will get it, you know? And I
think if the world tribe doesn't win
today, one of those boys is going home.
I need someone like Tony in this game to
heighten the threat level. Being a
two-time winner, that's really
dangerous. Tommy, on the other hand,
he's chopping wood. He's making clothes
lines. He's telling stories about
Finland.
So, I need Tony in this game as a
shield.
You want to make a deal?
What deal do you have to propose?
Endurance for Endurance. One of those
drops now. The next Endurance. The other
one dropped.
Cass takes the deal. And poverty wins
individual immunity for Wells.
Honor that deal. Did Barbie tell you she
found the key to the box?
Yes or no?
What makes you think that? What makes
you know that?
I know that for a fact. How?
And you didn't tell me, right?
What makes I don't I thought we were
close.
How do you know that?
Right now.
Tell me how you know that. Who told you
that?
Why did you pull us out of camp to go
look for little sticks?
Because we needed little sticks.
We needed little sticks. There wasn't a
million little sticks next to the camp.
Why did we Why did you pull us from the
camp to go get coconuts?
Because we couldn't see.
Why did you want us to go get coconuts?
Why did you want us to go get coconuts?
Because I wanted a coconut cuz I was
thirsty.
Oh, there wasn't like five right there.
No, there was one coconut.
That's it. I'm good.
Okay, I'm good, too. I'm ready to vote.
Oh, wow.
This is my second time. Like ready to
vote.
This one's easy.
When you're backed into a corner,
kitty's got claws. Don't come at me like
that, Tony.
We all this for me.
Good night, poverty.
Good night.
I'm really getting used to being in the
hot seat in tribal council. The second
time I've been called out by one of
these big guys. Well, that was crazy
with Tony.
Why do they keep coming for you and then
voting for me? Yeah.
Yeah.
I didn't expect Tony to go so berserk,
but when he did, he made the vote so
easy for me.
I can't even get over that shoe thing.
Wow.
Three. Four. I'm counting you down like
I count down my daughter.
Oh no.
Three.
Wow.
When I get to one, there's no more
coming back.
Two.
Wow.
Why?
You don't want me as your enemy, Luke.
You don't want me coming after you.
I hate survivor. New flag.
Oh god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
These are really good. Some tea would go
really well with these. Well, they're so
crumbly and soft.
Thanks, Luke. He doesn't even know he
spent all his money on little old me.
You and me, bud. But still, I'll be
digging Luke's grave with that shovel.
You better believe. Try this again.
It just broke.
But it's not just cookies in the jar.
Congratulations, you found an advantage
in the game. This advantage offers you a
rare opportunity to seize power by
making another player's hidden immunity
idol your own. I am the princess of
power right now. I've got an immunity
idol and knowledge is power advantage.
If I know who has an idol, then I can
get their idol before the votes are
cast. What are you thinking?
Kirby, unless she's feeding me a bunch
of bull. She says Sarah don't like
people with big names.
So, one of them is playing us.
Yeah.
Because Sarah told me that Kirby likes
to be the top boss. I want to work with
Kirby.
However, I have to be smart about how
I'm playing
because if I'm the Black Widow,
Kirby's the Black Mamba. Both deadly in
their own right. It is a red flag that
Kirby wants to blindside her closest
ally.
Although this plan really works for me
because I want to work with Kirby. I
want to work with Shaunie.
I want to work with some of these people
that I've seen on TV. I think it'll be
fun.
Are we coordinated tonight?
Did you say wear green or nothing?
I did say that, right? Green and blue.
Those are our dear colors. Wear them.
Don't show up with anything outside of
that.
And I'll know that we can work together.
That's it. That's all we need. Are we
married?
I have a deeply committed relationship.
I do already.
Now the deal.
Casually looking at his shoe.
Comedy trying to smile through the pain.
But I'm like, if Kirby is legit, this
would be the way to seal the deal.
And then I'm going to have a dragon for
life.
I'm Khesi from Game of Thrones and Kirby
is my fire breathing dragon. And in
order to secure that wild beast, I might
have to make an offering. Oh man, I went
back and forth so many times, but in the
end, my decision came down to the fact
that you keep blindsiding the people you
get closest to.
I don't want that to be me. Kirby got
blindsided. It was a big deal.
It's fun.
It's not like a good feeling that
Kirby's gone. I don't I'm not like,
"Yay, we got her." I feel like that was
a big move. Probably a little too soon
for me.
Number one,
right?
I think Cass made a brilliant choice
picking me to come on the spa reward.
Well, Tony Zombie, man.
Poverty. Why do you think Cass took you?
Um, because Cass and I had an issue a
couple of days ago and I think she
wanted to build a bridge.
Bridge was built.
Yeah.
Yeah. Which champagne?
Champagne. Bridge.
Shampoo.
That'll do it.
What's going on here? I am freaking out.
I thought we had something locked in.
The five of us from the former world
tribe are all going to vote Shaunie,
but I don't think that's what's
happening tonight. Thankfully, I have an
idol in my bag. I've played Survivor
enough times to know when the vibes are
off.
And the vibes are off. I'm really
nervous. I feel like the vibe has been
off since I came back from the spa trip.
So, I'm just going to put this on
because I might have to play it tonight.
I might have to play it for me or Seria.
I'm actually not sure which one of us
I'll be playing it for.
Wow.
What?
We're not giving this imp.
No. No chance. This is too weird. I
don't know what's going on with Lisa.
She's been super sketch.
Tommy came up to me. I did not know
about this. And he said, "I've got the
numbers to go."
He said it was going to be him.
Cass, Luke,
and Johnny. And I so much.
Okay.
An opportunity to seize his power
by making another player's hidden
immunity idol your own.
Pity, she's going to put it on us.
I'll save it for later. Huh? She's going
to play it on us.
I'm going to play this for Lisa.
You playing this for Lisa?
Yeah.
Member of our jury.
Cass.
The blind side that was going to be
happening on me and Lisa told me about
it and said that Tommy was running it.
Yeah, that's true.
So that's where my boat's going. Go
home, Tommy. Last night I just kind of
bluffed it at Tribal. The advantage has
to be used before the votes are cast.
Luke didn't know that. So, what am I
going to do with this information? I'm
doing this to build a trust pact with
Luke.
I'm really hoping this doesn't backfire
on me. This is to seal our commitment.
Yeah. Let's see.
Together, we have the power.
Yeah. Tonight's the night, baby.
Ready for a big show with my
Maybe I'll play it. Maybe I'll give it
to Siri. You'll never know.
You never really know if someone's going
to stick by the deal that they made.
And I know Luke has an idol now. We got
to rewrite history in so many ways.
What? How many years later?
It was 2008.
How many years is that? 17 years.
Yeah.
I have relished my time out here with
Si. It's been a dream come true to play
with her again.
Crazy, right?
I'm so eager to rewrite the story of Ser
and I at the end of this game in
Micronesia. She should have been there
in our final three. Seri and I played
the entire game together alongside
Amanda. And then at the end, it ended up
not being a final three. It was a final
two. So then three missed out on the
final and now this time I want her there
at the end with me and yours for me
if we both say it at the same time.
Wow.
Okay, we can play it for each other.
Let's exchange the idols.
Okay,
as a symbol of our trust and commitment.
Okay. Okay. See, cuz no one wants to say
a name first.
I know. So, who you playing this for?
Poverty.
I need a name. Ask Luke first.
Okay. Play it for
Okay. So, you're playing this for Luke,
right?
Okay. And Luke, you were playing this
All right.
And poverty wins. Final immunity.
Oh, yeah. Thank you. God, my legs are Oh
my god.
How's that feel?
It feels so good.
Yeah.
Yeah. I want to be in that final. I want
to like win this game and it means so
much to me and I've never won the final
immunity.
Wow, there it is.
The last time I was here in Samoa, I got
so close to the end and was burned by a
bitter jury. So, I'm hoping that tonight
things go a little differently. So, then
when I sensed that there could be a move
being made on me, I felt like, okay,
here's my time. I got to make some
pandemonium at this tribal council. pull
out my idol, put it around my neck, but
I'm like, I still don't feel safe.
Gathered the troops, Luke and Janine,
and then Cass whips out her idol, and I
was like, wasn't expecting that, but
then I remembered I had the advantage.
So, you got to be on your toes out here.
I pull out my advantage. Read the first
two lines, which say, "Oh, this is
knowledge is power. You can steal
someone's immunity."
But I don't read the third line that
says, "You have to present this to
Jonathan before he says it's time to
vote."
I keep that information to myself.
Luke got so scared that he came up to me
and was like, "Please rip up your
advantage. I have an idol. I haven't
told anyone about it."
But he told me, giving me complete power
over his game. Why was it so important
for you for me to be sitting here with
you?
Oh,
it's
so miraculous
to have a survivor soulmate.
And I was like, if Siri wants to work
with me and we can lock in like we did
in Micronesia
to have another chance,
I'm going to get her to the end of the
game. And as soon as I knew you had to
go up against Luke at Fire, I was like,
"This is going to be a blood bath."
It feels like a sinking feeling like I
wanted you I wanted you to be sitting
here. I really did.
Poverty.
Poverty. That's two votes. Poverty.
Poverty.
Winner of Australia versus the world.
Poverty.

# George Mladenov

introduction I'm King George from
Survivor brains versus

Target in Australian Survivor history on
my new broad shoulders but they've grown
for a reason I'm the kind of person that
can dodge the bullet you don't need to
prioritize shelter building on day one
in Australian Survivor you need to
prioritize relationships and
conversations I've been such a big fan
of you as a PO player since the day I
basically turned 18 really I look Jackie
in the eyes and I know that this is a
person that I can trust Jackie is a
poker player she's used to playing hard
and aggressively on the poker
table great there's my rock solid Ally
in this tribe's doing assignment he's
just bossing to everyone just put it put
it down yeah you want to dig a hole Yeah
and then Jordy I wouldn't trust as far
as I could throw him Johnny she's
keeping her cards close to her chest you
played with her I've never met a Jackie
J I used to love you on Dat line I used
toine all the time my alliance with Cara
propelled us both to the very end and I
found my Cara two of them in Jackie and
Angelie Jackie on the course
now wow that's going to
hurt are you guys
okay Jackie still in the mud pit she
does not look
happy just stay there I'm going to have
the Medics take a look at you George is
okay but but they're going to keep him
overnight for further
observations he

call back in bankstown and she's going
to be told that her son has a broken
neck okay good I cried great sometimes
I'm like cry cry yeah
good I'm in trouble on this
tribe Angel's been voted off Jackie's

decision and it is what it is we won
today's reward Challenge and I can't
wait to start the raid on the hero try
leave them a very simple message you
know what you have to do George we've
taken your food and left you with no
dignity we need to raise it to the
ground the maete down I'm cutting their
shelter I don't Brat's ass about being
nice to them if you're worried about

your priority but my priority is the
villains tribe I'm prioritizing our
current Tri future Rel me me the first
time player giving me the king of
Survivor tactical advice to leave the
other tribe
food well let me tell you something
sweetheart you actually have to get to a
tribe swap to play with the heroes but
I've already lost two girls I can't lose
the only gay that would be a crime
against humanity
so I think if you just keep like
pitching my I'm done I'm done I'm I'm on
your
train be the Spice
Girls yes with my scary face I could be
Scary
Spice love Baby Baby Spice the but you'd
be P well this has got to be sporty by
what did I actually do to you Michael
like I'm just no I'm just I'm just
wondering ing like we we haven't had any
conversations in 5 days I was being
treated for a possible fra check net for
one of them what did I actually do to
you to get you so frothing mad tonight
you're not frothing mad and you've done
absolutely nothing you're red in the
forehead your temples are about to
explode maybe it's the fire but you to
ask me who I don't trust who's the least
trustworthy second person voted out of
Heroes versus Villains Michael Michael
when you go home tonight you remember
remember these words I'm the king of
this game nobody will remember your
name
God the roots of trees okay where where
big roots on the way to the world youed
one yet if you go off running looking
for an idol now I'm not you better damn
find one otherwise every vote Will Go On
You third person voted out of her versus
Villains
Mimi what
I
where
what what called
exactly a
SP don't
wor I don't really mind that Jerry's
coming to the camp but Simon's put out
the world come mat for that old cun if
Simon bans for Jerry my position in the
tribe isn't as strong as it was before
and to make sure that Jerry doesn't get
too close to Simon my relationship with
Jordy which is progressing in my favor
but I can't let Simon get another puppet
in Jerry and ruined everything that I've
been working on in the Kingdom of
George or not yes yes
yes when Haley hugged me she was
something to you she said make sure you
work with Jerry yeah the baggage is I
went further than him in the game and he
needs to just get over
it I don't know why Sarah's decided to
leave my protection for Simon I've got
to watch my back for Sarah she's the
beauty queen that pushed another one
down the stairs but tonight I'm going to
push Sarah right back and I'm going to
do everything that I can to make sure
that Sarah will go next fifth person
voted out of here versus Villains
teror and now that Jerry's joined our
tribe I can set up my next
moves be great to get one more going
though who are you referring
to oh there
is that's sweet in inent 64y old gizard
is going to put the final nail in
Simon's coffin he's a gazelle in the
Lions
um who does oh my God ah
Simon he has no idea how to play this
game he's just clueless sometimes it's
better the devil you know right yeah
yeah Simon's dug his grave so deep he's
not not even going to realize that he's
about to go home with an idol in his
pocket the plan is to strengthen this
tribe by chopping off the
week and that's what I'll be doing at
the voting booth tonight you can't vote
for yourself
mate what do you mean by that
time I don't you're not our strongest
horse in the stable is what I'm
saying oh thanks Simon that's all right
I I I look back at why I decided to come
back for a second time because when I
went out to the Outback I literally
achieved everything under the sun that I
could ever have dreamed of as a lifelong
Survivor fan and I don't have a legacy
to add here in Samoa you don't want to
win it's not about winning
Simon winning isn't everything I'm going
to give all of you a chance to win
individual
immunity right now Mak flush the idol we
all vot for Steve
okay just we just Steve okay big flame
now Simon wins individual immunity this
is the strategy we are an invisible
block of three out of six I
am between the three boys that I lost
when I was trying my best if you're like
know Simon stop putting on the show
we're over it for God's sake Simon told
me the plan was Steve
so clearly it must have changed multiple
times
today
shops everyone's name for my name um of
course he has you call yourself a king
that's what grinds my gears George think
it's just jealousy Simon that's
what no you cut me off
before I have not done anything to you
in this game I've been civil to you
you've literally yelled at me and then
you are so passive aggressive you feel
the need to speak over me never make
this game personal Simon never thank you
George for that don't make the same
mistakes you made in the outback I'm not
going
to just have a quick meeting I have an
idol I'm playing it
tonight you're going to get showed
tonight no one's a bigger warmonger on
game than me and I'm about to blow
up wow the grain the ski
Jonathan isn't that
interesting it suits the color of my dog
shirt so who are you sending home are
you going to save Steve with your rideal
Simon
presses on are you a hero or a
villain Simon we are oneir through the
game you've made a lot of mistakes
you've treated me as your enemy when I'm
not better the enemy battering down at
your front door of the fort than the
traitor
within Jordie was going to do something
to you much much worse than what Danny
did to you in the outback because Danny
didn't pretend to be your best mate like
Jordy
does jordy's told every single person
here about your ridol for me
Jonathan all right it's a lose lose for
me George yes that's why I'm a political
operative that's why I'm the king of
Australian Survivor Simon
congratulations congratulations you're
all learning a lesson are you saving
Steve or not I protect my people to the
death because Glory or death St don't
forget that you said you'd protect us
Glory or death and you do you feel
protected after that you when when you
wake up tomorrow morning Steve you'll
know who you can believe sixth person
voted out of Heroes versus
Villains
Fraser Checkmate
wa now you know who you can trust
tomorrow Steve this was a test thank you
for the conversation at Camp it really
meant a lot to that's that's one
interpretation the other one was Jordy
organized the blinds side of Simon for
the second time with an idol he was so
oblivious he had no idea it was coming
but then we had an individual immunity
challenge that Simon crushed and he
saved himself and sadly for Fraser he
was collateral damage in a minority
vote and I played my idol
Diamond still has an
idol
okay okay 260 300 320 we're 320 to
George you have a money pae you going to
let him have it yeah all right 320 to
George shie and
lie
are we going now yes you
are these Spice Girls are going to have
the time of their lives at this Feast
we're going to eat every single block of
cheese every bit of meat and Munch on as
much caboni as we possibly can we
obviously don't have much time so we
need to get on the fire we need to get
food going so we need firewood I'm going
to get the fire going um we're going to
get the rice ready if you can do that
tonight's vote is crucial it's the first
one since we've dropped our Buffs and it
sets the complete tone for the rest of
the hero's tribe moving forward I don't
want Ben going home and I want one of
the other original Heroes to be sent
packing think about what God would want
what would God
want so Stevie this is like a pathway so
we trying to just keep everything over
there steady up we going to smudge it
mate I trust me I've been doing the far
the whole time mate I don't think God
likes
Paige just get rid of Paige at tonight's
Tribal Council I think the cowgirl is
going to ride her Pony
home
George thank you
shie George does not count
George does not
count
George
does not count
George does not
count
Paige person voted out of Heroes versus
Villains
Paige me shie Jerry and Steve are a
majority of four with seven players left
on this new Hero's tribe we control the
numbers let do sit down and we can't
wait to put out hit after hit on Ben on
flick and on mass which what do you
think happened over
there I think it's more of the same and
I interpret that move as a declaration
of
war we've got two hostages here and I'm
ready to cut them
loose throwing it they're throwing
it not so much today's challenge I put
in a huge effort ooh I'm pushing so hard
here every everyone we must reflect in
the
feet we lost a I threw the challenge
today for one simple reason to vote out
these original Heroes going to show his
Idol no he's giving it to
flick do you want a showers flick I do
have an idol is it yeah I do do you want
to put it on your neck flick not really
I'll keep it in my bag and I'll whip it
out tonight you think flick should do
with
it why don't you put it in the fire
flick
think about it f stream on mate that's a
risk I'm not going to take why it'll
it'll lock in the future of your game it
will it it's something you can talk
about at a final Tribal Council but
right now it's time to change the plan
and to bring Matt on board is dly
dallying around where Matt can't decide
whose side he's on I don't care if Matt
is a nice bloke I don't care if he saves
people's lives in the ocean all I care
about is this which side Matt choose it
merge in the cookie jar well Simon you
passed it on to your best friend flick
and lied to all your mates over there
why don't you explain yourself you know
what George I don't know what the hell
is going on well that's very clear to
all of
us I've lived with flick for 47 days in
the
outback and I know to take Flick's
promises with a grain of
salt but I think shie and Le have fallen
under flick spell
Nina blindsided you last night she's
working with the
others was she going to go through get
me out
yes I know that our alliance will be
stronger and better together in the
future if we chop flick now she changes
sides like the wind why would I leave
flick in the game so she can run off
back to Sam and David the moment we hit
merge no no this is what will happen
because flick will be flick
lovely girl but we're not the priority
flick just flick on the game like that I
trust her when she says she wants to
work with
us I think we
should nothing's changing right we also
want
wom
next just a sof
CH it's true it's just strategically
it's wor of us with think no that's all
right yeah going back there
hoping to align with a
hierarchy be I just can't
say 11th person voted out of Heroes
versus Villains
Stevie thank

big sacrifice to say yes I know I hope
pay the
favor as far as long going us three are
t to the end yeah yeah t stick together
the
three sitting down at the merge Feast I
was a bit
nervous right now there are eight
original Heroes all this seems amazing
and four original villains here on this
new tribe
on paper we're pretty
outgunned but I'm at my best when I'm
leaping up off my
feet and I am going to hit the ground
running can we open the lobster I
haven't tried it yet the take the head
whatever that is you take the whole
thing my head it's like die
haly right now my priority is
simple I'm on theoo today's merge beast
and I've made it clear with my cross
tribe interactions with Haley that I'm
definitely willing to work with her this
time let's do a toast we made it all
right to and to finally be on the same
Tria for 28 days finally we thought of
something Survivor focused in Samoa and
that's the word mole mole and mo mole
means two things it means I'm hungry and
it means
please just sticking with the theme of
heroes and villains um we thought of
Vigilantes cuz not quite a hero not
quite a villain we all put it to a vote
3 2 1 Molly Molly 1 2 3 4 5 six that's
six that's I'm
get mly Mo it is cu a 7 Mo it
is I warned shie and Liz that flick just
changes her mind and now flick has
thrown us under the
bus we need to get a plan up and running
to Take Back Control of this
tribe right now there's a block of five
between shie Liz and myself and Jerry
and
Matt but I'll need seven people in an
alliance to make sure that I'm in a
majority one of the single biggest moves
you can make when you're playing
Survivor is to turn your enemy in the
game into your friend and that's exactly
what I'm going to do with Simon because
the deal that we got offered was Simon
you're out
first that Mak sense
yeah I would rather David Sean Sam goes
so we have a decision to make moving
forward that will determine all of our
destiny do you know what you could say
Simon was hanging around like a bad
smell then he walked off and we're still
on the Simon plant that's that's what
you can say no offense s sounds good
I've been at war with Simon for the
first half of this game but if I can
reel him in with an offer of peace
I can maneuver him and I can take charge
of this game changing it to David right
now just in case Sam does have a KN Yeah
the more I think about it there's no
difference between Sam and David one's a
potato one's a potato and I'm going to
toss out the rotting
veggies right where they belong now so
how comfortable do you feel about your
position tonight I'm 100% confident
tonight you if you don't know what's
happening on day 29 then what the hell
has been going on the past couple of
weeks we've had an epic season of Heroes
feed villains and you've played a very
important role as a raw potato so
consider your game now
cooked 12th person voted out of Heroes
versus
Villains
me They're All
Dead cus meeting George the unifier has
brought seven very very different people
together for the common cause to get the
king to the top seven I've got a loyal
foot soldier Jerry my old friendenemies
Simon and Haley and a new mate in Matt
with allies shy and Liz those four
Heroes can't do anything to stop my
crusade for that holy holy crown we are
literally the top seven unless something
goes catastrophically
wrong why would you jump into a minority
that's unstable it's that simple really
un
concerned so am I I'm on the same
page I'm happy with that any be happy
with that y flick has been skating on
thin ice for a while now she somehow
survived the tribal council when Stevie
went home but tonight is going to be the
night that flick finally gets the flick
I don't think the decisions that were
made at Tribal Council the other night
put anyone any better
place
okay George did you just say
something um no I I I have a different
interpretation of it I think um people
had the chance to get on the winning
ship at the last Tribal Council and that
ship sailed and left the port jlp and
just because you're standing by at the
deck going give me a ticket give me a
ticket mate the cruise ship's gone it's
sailed it's sailed we're going to have a
great time now please let me win let me
win just once I don't want immunity I
want KFC drops out and that is it haly
and George win
rewards there is the Survivor heaven red
and wi KFC
dreams big buckets of chicken a popcorn
chicken of chips of ss I want to dip
everything in the SS and I can't wait to
stick some KFC in my mouth my true
friend ofy in this game is Haley I'd
love to get to the end with the queen
because nothing would say redemption
more than beating Haley at the final
Tribal Council the reason
why we have the same problem it's the
money issue what do you mean by that
well people might not want to give you
the money twice I know that I know I
know it's like a tough spot for me to
ask and I won the $60,000 set for life
reward of the
option help my surprise Survivor party
she did not
did if any other player on this tribe
finds out about my secret prize I'll
know that I'll have a problem with Haley
and that's exactly why I've told her C
four on
Nina it must be
Nina I'd like to I'd like to vote then
if that's y I'd like to why don't we
just okay let's let's go guys on Nina
girls on joh okay easy simplify it and
there's no got him we've caught Simon
with his pants down and this is the
final red flag for me trying to be on
the majority of a split vote because he
wants to change his vote with the
minority and probably vote for me I saw
him celebrating with the Enemy at a
challenge and now he's trying to protect
his boyfriend sha more than anything
else and I have to convince the rest of
the Vigilantes to change the
plan
yeah we don't have much time we okay
Simon he is not with us
tonight we are voting for
Sam we will tell Matt and Sam we do not
say a word to sign me I would like to
play it for myself okay thank you you
have to pight for
me pight for yourself all right yeah
first
vote
George

George
George
Sam m
14th person voted out of Heroes versus
Villains
Sam thank God he's such a bad
player otherwise I'd be gone can give
you some of these chili the she
balls the shees yeah you have her when
did the Spice Girls become the sh this
Spice Girls Alliance has been my core
and and my base since day three in the
game and sh's been my closest Ally since
the very very start on villain's speach
and now I find out shie and Liz are
walking around calling our alliance this
she the more I think about this she the
more I'm starting to realize shny will
take Liz to the final two we're going to
have to make a move on our alliance at
8 are you afraid of of G yeah that we
have to yeah sha is a third time player
and if we get down to five or six
players left shy will be ruthless and
I'm not going to risk myself going home
if I don't fire the first bullet at shie
I think she might fire at me shie thank
you so much for being a great friend but
tonight I'm going to prove a point that
tactics and strategy are more important
in Survivor in Social game thank you for
teaching me your social
skills 15th person voted out of Heroes
versus Villains third member of our jury
shaie that's okay the biggest risk of
the blinds side of shaie was losing Liz
and I've just reeled her back in Simon
offering me a top two
deal you're right it might my
only I mean the nerve of him George has
already won
$60,000 no way I know he won it at the
auction the plan is quite simple myself
Jerry and Matt are going to put three
votes on Sha Haley Nina Liz and sha will
be putting four votes on Simon if if any
person sitting here hasn't thought about
who they're going to want to work with
in the final three or how they're going
to get to the final two then you know
they're definitely behind the eight ball
because the game moves and if you
haven't done anything yet you might as
well just stand up and join those three
on the jury benches cuz you're wasting
everyone's
time I haven't done anything and um no I
didn't say that to you
did never said anything like that to you
at all s we said I had nothing under my
belt or something along those
lines I don't think so that was probably
directed to
Shan not everything's about you Simon No
not
tonight I hope Simon goes
tonight person voted out of Heroes
versus Villains fourth member of our
jury
Sean
Nina um the three guys in N it wasn't me
I
V wasn't me Jerry or man no iot and it
wasn't Haley and it wasn't Liz it wasn't
anyone else that was the second V red no
I was the second vote R what was I was
you just gave it up n I was the second V
better off owning it as a move I'd be
more impressed by that you genely
believe it was me and it wasn't one of
the other girls then how do I know you
won the set for life reward at the
Survivor
auction so
yeah and which one of the girls told you
that what no no this is very interesting
because right now you're the priority
Target to go and you're dead and this
might save your
game Haley up with Haley Haley's been
trying to screw me over for the past
couple of
days and I'm in a bit of State of Shock
God I'm like having a heart I'm having a
heart attack too does she know that you
she doesn't know that I know so I want
this to be a secret war on haling last
night was the first time that I didn't
know the exact outcome of a boat I think
he was one of my closest friends in
rles we obviously talk like on a weekly
basis in real life she didn't need to do
this I'm sad because I genuinely wanted
to get to the final two with Haley again
we could have stood next to each other
friends king and queen and the best
player could have
won I let my guard down Haley used our
relationship outside the game against
me here's the Survivor Spa the Survivor
spa and the jacuzzi Alliance that will
run out the end game Alliance Cheers
Cheers today is about one simple thing
who is the better game player King
George or queen
Haley Haley I wanted to take you to the
final Tribal Council so the two best
players could get to the end but tonight
I will reain on this drive
alone 17th person voted out fifth member
of our
jury it's clear that I've played the
best game here in samawa by an absolute
Country Mile and with 7 days left in the
game My Conquest isn't
over I've set myself up better than any
other person because I have two top
three
Deals one with Jerry and man I was just
saying my plan is to stick with you okay
all right I'm believing you 100% and one
with the jacuzzi 3 with liis and Nina so
the next six days are going to fly will
F yeah just I can pivot left or right is
why I'm going to win Simon has made it
to day 41 on she luck
alone and tonight Simon will get what's
been coming for him his torch snuffed
just like it says on his
hat
after 42 long days Simon I finally get
to see you go home person voted out
sixth member of our jury Simon I feel
like I've really achieved something
again playing Survivor for the second
time and I'm in the top five again I've
gotten to the top five by being a
ruthless and fun villain willing to take
chances why are you
doing I've worked really hard to
position myself still in the middle of
the tribe I can stick with Jerry and
Matt and go to the top three with them I
could go back to my jacuzzi Alliance and
make amends with Nina Nina your tribal
council performance tonight made me
decide to vote for you cuz I was going
to vote for Matt but I reckon I'm better
off with a happy Jerry and unhappy Liz
sorry I came in here with the biggest
Target on my back but look at me now
now I didn't come here to decrease my
Threat
Level I ramped it
up I've proven why I'm one of the
legends of the game if I can present my
case to the jury Heroes versus Villains
will be the coronation of the king
nobody deserves that Crown more than
me it's Cara
yes
Cara
M I made
it you know what he's learned from the
last game I think and he's come in and I
I think he's a
hero I think Jerry realizes might as
well let his best friend George
win every single decision that Jerry's
made has benefited me 20th person voted

# Shonee Bowtell

I was home right now I could be like going out for breakfast and then I would be going down
to the beach I woke up in the morning and I was like oh yeah I'm on Survivor okay Che cheers
kinky I was it swallow did you bite I beat mine that was pretty
non-eventful want to start playing ladies we just
did the boys are all about strength they're all about testosterone and strength dollar dollar bills y dollar
dollar bills I'm sick of them and I can't wait to take them down we would
love to get Zach out they cute Zach romance you
relax Zach honestly just thinks he's like God's gift to life oh
P that ass that's literally what it's like hanging around him once we get
Jenna tan and Heath coming on board with us the boys are in
trouble shaie that's fourth person voted up from Australian Survivor Champions versus
contenders
Steve shie starting a struggle no I'm not apparently I have that wrong I'm
really conflicted about tonight's voice tan wants to get Benji out Benji wants
to send tan home but then also I feel like the camp would be a happier place if we vote out Zach moving forward I
just want to keep my options open and right now it seems like I have quite a few options I'm feeling great today I've
woke up there's no smelling Zach around Camp Zach eats so much yeah yeah I'm
doing like 50 reps a day go home smash a protein sh make couple of chickens I'm
eating 6,000 calories a day and then me I'm like oh wow that's so interesting
you have won your first reward in 23 days Johnny your dream is about to come
true it is ah Jonathan you don't even understand how much I love AI so I'm so
excited it's happening it's here I absolutely love Margies all day all
night I love them but I think the cherry on the top was the fact that Zach's like
oh you guys need this my physical strength and then we get rid of him the next day we win without
Victory I love them so I'm not actually a graphic
designer oh really yeah I'm not I'm not I'm um I run a business like an online
business I make make like good money um I made like over a million do last year oh my God yeah I have a lot of money I
don't need to win this you know I want to make top six is my goal I don't really know why Benji told
me this it doesn't really make strategic sense to me Benji needs to leave the
island immediately if you're not here to win half a million dollars then
scram oh and can you not tell anyone that my like even vanilla because you know if it gets out there I'm in trouble
Ben you told me he's a millionaire selling Fitness Products the
US I think Benji knows the game a lot more than what he wants us to think so I
think that does make him a Target I want to be the smartest and most strategic player on my tribe so I have to get rid
of him my God a bug just fls so close to my
ear oh bloody H this is my home now
oh feeling great I'm on a tribe with six randoms and one person actually know
this day couldn't be better this is detrimental to my game I had it so good
over there for 25 days on the contenders tribe I did absolutely nothing I did not cook the rice or beans once I was
thinking oh don't worry sh like this is the hand you've been dealt but I'm like this
shie how you feeling right now great in this lovely tribe of Champions we have
four athletes and one genius and
myself so as you can imagine I'm fitting in just fine I'm finding it really hard
I genuinely have nothing in common with these people and took him another 10 or 15 years to put wheels on a beam oh M
Wheels On A Suitcase are the best invention ever I'm like how is this riveting
conversation like so boring never owned a suitcase you know just get one of the
good hiking backpacks so it's definitely a lot different to the contenders tribe where every third word was Dick I'm so
bored over here like legit if someone said shie do you want to watch two
seasons back to back of antiques Road Show I would say yes please that's how
bored I am I've survived with doing below the bare minimum obviously if I'm going to stay here I need to build
relationships and get to know people better luckily I'm good at faking it till you make
itcap fre Mars I think that plan looks the best I
like Saturn though Saturn looks nice looks pretty toasted
coconut I've managed to continually slip through the cracks and that's their own
fault I came here to win half a million dollars surprise surprise you must it's
underestimated me didn't you enough sugar to last you for the rest
500 500 from shy yeah anyone else want to get in on this stay away
everyone going twice sold to shie oh you've got a good dentist oh my
God don't drop it no
they cat
own business eating some frogs when I see a clue inside my jar my heart starts
beating I'm so excited I don't know what this clue says but I have to stop eating my lollies and I have to build a fort
around the clue so no one else sees my clue the next it finel is the only
person I trust out here so to be reunited with vanilla is excellent news
for me I'm laughed since he left all they talk about is
nutrition and all they they talk they say like every fifth word is so big I don't understand anything they say like
they talk about the biggest topic is workout eth
ethicacy oh it's a bit heavy me best work oh you got me biceps
going bring to bacon tonight anyone just say physical f
at the auction yesterday not only did I spend $500 on the jar of lollies I
opened up the jar and I saw a clue I couldn't wait to do the big
reveal congratulations you found an advantage in this
game this Advantage allows you steal a trib mate's vote at Tribal Council this
is massive for me like I'm so happy everyone probably thinks they can beat
me just like oh yeah harmless little
radar and that's perfect for me I'm a Power Player and I'm being underestimated
strategically the Champions have the numbers right now but they won't be running the joint for much longer it's
like the inmates taking over the guards is what's happening absolute Hoots vanel
and I have a special ability to find cracks and just float our way to the top
we've done it before at the contenders tribe and we're going to do it here at merge as well slip through the cracks
once again can't get rid of asking the advantages of getting Matt
out tonight is that probably the biggest threat in the tribe would be gone not
only is Matt a physical threat but he runs this Camp he tells people how to vote so if you take out the leader the
Sheep will scatter and we might have some more numbers coming to us
we are the mighty little ducking taking on the big bad godfa yeah it's like two
one so girl
God this is the move of the game the tri Vector with the tri
Vector Matt the tribe is spoken hi Sean's coming up to me and
saying what do you think about Brian
good oh yeah yeah I forgot about that I could not believe it benty is an
absolute idiot um Brian has the immunity necklace around his neck Johnny and
Monica battling it out for that
necklace oh my God Sean Sean individual immunity
surpr oh my God shny come on
what an honor yeah individual immunity is yours last night at Tribal Council
everything went just the way I wanted it to Brian and Monica proved that they do
want to work with Fel and I in the future and we took out a member of Shane Steve and Shan's Alliance I'm feeling on
top of the world because I'm no longer on the bottom Tip Top I'm at the top where I
like to be I call this my power look well we are a power
couple we are on the two last standing contenders mean I'm so glad we don't
have to share it same and I are a power couple and they still don't vote for us
don't like you guys are
crazy Brian is an absolute idiot we need to stick to the
plan we need to do two votes on Shane two votes on Shan we're not changing the plan for me
it means that I'm a lone wolf out here but don't worry I'm a sassy
and I always get what I want so watch out
by taking Monica on the reward this is perfect for me because now I'm going to
work with Shane and sha to take out the biggest threat you vote for my girl finel I will find you and I will vote
you out is that
exciting in London I am a personal assistant to a super rich guy and it's
All Stars
the best job ever shie is my Survivor spirit
animal she is the funniest Survivor that's ever played I think she's just a
ripping good time exactly like Tony H darling like theard shny is the only
person on earth that could get a job by patting a dation it's just the most shy thing ever
and I am here for it sit down and shut
up I'm go with that like I don't need an invitation to be naughty cuz I already am me Nick shie with the Little Rascals
this is our there's no ratting here no there is none this is UN unless it's on all the players stitches stitches get
stitches King spoken princess pickle has spoken it's definitely a good reward you
know to taste something sweet after 11 days is absolutely Divine next minute i'
see like a little scroll just underneath the log first of all I do a little quick
survey of the area um I'm really full I know I've got about one second to
quickly grab the
clue I think I did it quite swiftly so I'm hoping no one saw it
congratulations you found the clue to hidden immunity idol but while it's hiding in a place that's easy to find
it's very hard to get to because the idol you seek is hidden underneath the
well I am so excited about having this clue it's my dream to have an idol and
now I'm halfway
there I've got to lift up a 70 kilo well dig under
and then hopefully there will be my
idol I think every single person was looking for an idol but guess who found it then I see Nick's little chicken legs
you not feeling oh my God feeling so sick check in the world looks weird
oh no why I don't know just weird I can't believe there's been no one has actually found anything someone has I
haven't heard a single thing I know either you look really serious I just moved the well and dug off an
idol you
serious I found a c okay my heart is resting Nick's waking
up which I think is so cute I love seeing him run around sweating these little short shorts now I just need to
play this correctly because I need everyone in this tribe to know that I mean
business don't mess with me I have been working on my plan non-stop but I
absolutely love it if I can get rid of Henry tonight it
is definitely an Allstar move I'm basically the CEO of this tribe I've Got The Power
tonight I'm too stressed to think about something to say if anyone has a hidden immunity idol and
you want to play it now will be the time to do
so okay I'll play mine just so it feels is
real you better get it out
D shaie does not count shaie
does not count shaie does not
count shie does not count shie does not
count Henry that's two votes
Henry fifth person voted out of Australian Survivor All Stars Henry
that's three votes I will not stop until I get revenge on Abby Lee John and
Lydia I am stoked that I played my idol correctly last night but now I know that
I'm hanging out people who don't even want me around this is all stars but yet we have that cliche the athletes hanging
out together let's keep the tribe strong which is definitely dangerous for someone like me sh is easy to
underestimate like she's a really good game player like she's very Abby is definitely the leader of the athletes
group and then there's Lee John Lydia is like attached to the hip with Abby so
it's just like this massive lame pile of like
muscle you absolutely killed it Harry and Nick are my best friends out here I
just trust them 100% but we're definitely now in the minority we have three boats already we just need two
more and then we've got five which is a new majority we can really flip this tribe on its head now shy won the battle
and it's now it's time for the little Ras to win the war first of all I'm so glad that you're here because I know I
love working with you I think it's so good that we actually think the same things at the same time like yesterday when we're finishing off each other's
sentences and things I thought that was great too Sean come to me darling we definitely have to awaken them we need Z
yeah he's got massive muscles he has a massive ego and that's something that we can work with and then I had a beautiful
sleep in Exile great Zach and I are an unlikely Joy but
we get along great we're having a great time we are we calm home he sets up the fire I lay out my
song we're drinking coconuts celebration Nation quick face mask really get us
ready for our day I don't know I'm pretty Co H I need that skin looking fresh for whatever today
brings scrub away the bad vibes mhm the
soul is feeling cleansed already makuda tried to vote me out last night but I'm back
I'm going to come after them and I'm not going to stop until I'm gone or they're gone April
26 tourist my social game inside the game of Survivor is even better than my
social game outside of Survivor I'm just like an easygoing relaxed fun girl who
doesn't want to be friends with that when the chips are down that's where Allstar Legends are made top of my
priority list is getting revenge on Abby she's all about physical strength but
that doesn't work for my game time to send her packing somebody's got to go home tonight shie is by far the weakest
link in our tribe she's got to go oh my God and then
it goes in the rise crunchy popcorn oh my God my greatest skill in Survivor is
my social game looks very like jungly leave it looks
good I have solidified some good relationships already and now I need to make sure that all the old vamers know
that Abby was in charge of makuda and that she is the one that holds everyone
together if they get rid of Abby that's how we weaken makuda Abby is like literally the leader of yeah he' be so
dumb the dumbest thing I'm the one that has no like you guys are my numbers now I need at least four vakas and then
myself and Harry Abby Lydia and John are hell tight if you get rid of me you're
just helping them to stay stronger shie is a cat with nine
lives she's on the chopping block she plays an idol sends Henry home she's on the chopping block gets sent to Exile
comes back into the game she's a threat shie Abby says let bygones be bygones
how do you feel about that I'll have to wait and
see I miss you getting Blindside tonight don't

I've set and we're going to send ldo home any chats not yet L has tried to get me out
three times now and I've had enough that relationship is completely over and if my relationship is over with someone

here you know I idle out Henry I got out Abby and now I just need to continue
this streak until all my enemies are gone person going to fire for vaka Lydia
that's five votes go go go but Harry and I decided to put 100%

but there was definitely a tear or two shed when I saw the size of the Sanger I
was about to consume ready for me um light up in Harry it's not here it's

you 11th person voted out of Australian Survivor All Stars
click I want to bring shny over all right shny oh go ahead bye guys losing
to their challenge but still getting the reward is the best deal ever not only am
I getting a feed and a bloody mary but I get some very valuable information about the other tribe minimal effort and
maximum return Moana is definitely the queen of makuda she took a seat on her
throne and I was summoned by her gave me a tap to come sit over next
to her Moana has never spoken to me in this game and then she's like how are you Dar I'm like okay hi good yes thank
with the boys when we got back home it wasn't that good no was was don't worry I didn't miss out on
anything they missed out on a lot I made merge how exciting I'm getting closer
and closer to my title of Soul Survivor and I can smell the Gucci
already I have a lot of strengths in this game but one of them is my social game if you any anything to talk about
with him say that I told you about K first Zach loves
Birds he's so passionate about birds which means that I'm so passionate about bird if she needs to connect with Zach
birds are our easy way to fly on in Zach tell me she used to breed Birds oh
really we we rescue Birds oh yeah we do we've got like a couple massive averies
and I'm sure there's going to be a new one there when I get home yeah look I have not much in common with most these
people but that's not going to stop me what birds did your bra pocks oh I told
her to chap Birds to Zach and that's what she's doing good girl everyone chasing
shaie places her n 3 2 one shie well done sh win
immunity first individual immunity win and what a win it was I don't actually
know why I'm so great at balance I tell everyone that I do Pilates but I haven't actually done Pilates for over a year I
don't know I am so Devo that Harry's gone I am now in an alliance of three
against seven people I need to find some cracks but I have pretty much nothing in
common with these people like tarzen a lime farmer and what do you do oh a
personal assistant fear not I am a social butterfly I have wor worked my magic
before and I can do it again so where do you live Taren I near Toba oh really I

smile this has turned into one serious battle for that necklace sh's ball has
not moved in 2 hours oh my oh my God
her second individual immunity necklace beating the golden god is amazing this
is the second time I've beat him now I learn to tread water like that because I go to the pool sa a steam room most days
doggy paddling and chatting with my friend that's all I do just like talk to my friend just like
this everyone's like oh we have to get rid of shie she she's not strong well suck on that
Jackie is kind of just floating around like a lost puppy at the moment my social game is definitely my strength
here and I'm planning on working Jackie hard that some one girl I got that many oh my God so I'm going to give Jackie
all the love and attention that she needs and she's going to feel so welcomed in my alliance did you think
bringing me as a strategic play or you just wanted some com I'm hang out with you I have figured out that Jackie needs
to feel wanted so I've been pointing out some hard truths look at your alliance
today who are they cheering on they're not cheering on you no that's right everyone just thinks like oh no Jackie no she would just do as we say she'll
just do as we say but oh no Jackie won't be no Jackie it was never the plan to do that all along anyway you don't want to
be that me big moon I am sick of fighting from the
bottom and I'm ready to take control of this tribe for my plan to work I need
the majority Alliance to be splitting the votes three on me and three on AK but AK Brooke myself and Jackie will
actually put four votes on our secret Target Zack three votes Zack three votes
shie two votes AK one vote left 16th person voted out of Australian
Survivor all stars and third member of our jury Zach Jesus
Christ shy and I we actually really bonded over at exile she decided to turn
on me that's the game of Survivor ear she got me again do you think the people underestimated you I think they
definitely underestimated me but you know you have these random leisure activities doggy paddling in the pool
Pilates but they come in really handy you just doggy paddling in your local
pool had you beat the golden God who like totally I do that all the time with
my friend I'm just paddling chatting so I was just out there thinking just keep swimming swimming swimming
Heroes vs Villians
Honeys I am home I am the first person to play Australian Survivor three times
so suck on that everyone who ever underestimated me I am back because inflation is a
higher I need half a mill I have to formally ask you will you
be in an alliance with I would love to she definitely gives off BF best friend
energy here we go we can have fun here the First Time Players I like some puppies that I'm trying to distract no I
think it's a fair point I mean it makes sense yeah the biggest villain in My Tribe would without a doubt be shny shny
can never be trusted she's as sneaky as you can get Stevie is as threatening as a
butterfly was that my name heard I have I'm just p on half I
haven't heard you would tell me 100 okay I hope so we got to get back before
everyone's like sh's got to go Angelie is just a sacrificial lamb to keep me
safe tonight my closest Ally out here is Liz I love Liz I loved her from the
moment I saw her resting
she how perfect Simon definitely has tunnel vision when it comes to George all he talks about is how much he just
wants to vote George off no honey it's not happening yet a person with no friends in this game is a great Ally
because who are they going to run to no one but me I am happy to whatever you want I
know why working so hard I've already lost two girls I can't lose the only gay
that would be a crime against humanity the Spice Girls my scary face I could be
Scary
Alliance for us because we're all a little bit spicy and I have to get that Target on to Michael he is running
around froing at the mouth just like gagging to say George's name to anyone who will listen fine then you can lean
I'm basically a principal of a school right now I'm trying to give everyone a little quick education on how this game
works the bigger picture is that we need Shields George is a shield it's not that
hard to grasp Simon Stevie is like the villains janitor he's always working ferociously to get this fire going the
best part about Stevie's taichi is we look through our triangle and we see our
destiny can you see it clearly a victory at the challenge so great let's just
hope Stevie's Truck Works otherwise he might be in the chopping block we are the first tribe in Australian Survivor
history to lose the first three imun challenges we are record
holders tribal here we come I I want to say I'm so forever grateful to both of
you you literally with George save my Survivor we did life you did oh is that
nice I'm time short it went my nose
stunning color coordination I mean what more could a go ask
for piece of water I've ever picked up this is not my first rodeo having an
idol and it's come at the perfect time I'm so
happy what a good yeah what a good find what a good day sh's in the zone over
there she is in the
zone back shie in the zone shie you've had a crack at this challenge before you
remember how long you went um 2 hours and 5 minutes you think you got another 2
hours in you y and that is
it villains win immunity sending Heroes to Tribal
Council I'm in two minds about picking my new buff because two of my closest
allies are both on different tribes now I want to refund
distressed and depressed you can invite any two people to join
be hero or villain I going to take shie and
Li going this literally looks like the same
one that I get at my favorite discount super I'm grabbing sausage dipping into
Cam and bear there's blue cheese I'm
I am in heaven right now I can see guys oh
oh please be an idol sh yes what a reward I came in here with
very limited accessories and now I've got two Idols things are definitely looking up I'm getting more Glam as the
days go on tonight is going to come down to what you and I tactically think is
better think about what God would want what
would God want I've been doing the for the whole time I don't think God likes
P Beau if anyone has a hidden immunity item they'd like to play it now'll be the time to do
so me please quite nervous
tonight so I'm going to play this for
George thank you shie George does not
count George does not count
George does not count George does not count
Paige eighth person voted out of Heroes versus Villains
Paige that was a very well played not my first
R I feel great about my new position in this tribe
Johny we have George and myself running the show and then we have our loyal friends Stevie and Jerry on our side too
I'm now getting five star treatment and I deserve nothing
less Steve's being very productive today that's good let's keep him working less
more working less chat yes Paige ran an extremely tight
ship mad Min sir The Bean Is The Bean is ready but you're not here anymore Paige
I am and I'm going to eat all the crispy rice my heart desires we started at the bottom now we're
here is shie one hero down should the rest of them be worried yes
wow we can't we can't we
can't we can't because it's the same outcome Steve do you can we throw some
smoking mirrors silence because smoking mirrors turns into working it out to uh
uh on her three on Matt oen and five people he's talking crazy like let's put
five votes on Ben I don't know what Stevie wants me to do like ring in a crab and be like do you want to be our
fifth Alliance member Jonathan would you like to come over for dinner I'm cooking let me think about that no just
sit here I feel on cloud n since I have Liz back in my loving arm okay it's
getting quite choppy Liz is not only important to my game but important for my mental health
out here and it's just incredible to think the Spice Girls used to run the villains
tribe but now we run the hero's tribe I think we
need the only name that they were like willing to throw around myself in that was
Simon like's the second
anyway that's the updated situation I'm going to try and smoo a bit
longer so that's definitely online obviously flick is a great manipulator
but a terrible terrible liar we just had a face conversation with yeah and she
was like just want to let you know there's no update of being really changing with me they're not giving me anything and I was like do you think I'm
done what you
sh I told him sticking wait so he know perspec have
the numbers no George George has spilled the beans to
Shan that we are voting for Sam that is literally the dumbest thing I've ever heard who do you want to play it for
count sha does not count shaie does not count shaie does
not count a that's four V chny thanks
Blake 12th person mured out of Heroes versus ens
David I cop four votes last night at Tribal Council and I do know flick not
only went against me but it was her idea to get me out last night I thought that flick and I had a genuine friendship out
here you know we were always laughing together we were talking about having some maggies on the outside world but
that doesn't change that she is 100% my next Target I saved her and she betrayed
me so all I can smell now is
Revenge click the tribe has spoken I sure have I'll look behind you and you
look behind me keep on
E can't take the villain out of the Shar

# Hayley Leake

I'm really proud to be a brain yeah we
have the more diverse team in terms of
skills I'm Haley I'm a pain
researcher my job is to study the
Neuroscience of pain so that we can help
people who have
pain so like run experiments on
people we use placebos sometimes so we
trick them uh we manipulate them into
thinking they're getting treatment when
they're not and I think that will help
translate across to the game
I've been preparing by kind of studying
the game yeah I've gone back over the
previous seasons and made spreadsheets
to analyze that data to try to figure
out how to best play the game my
strategy going into the game is to be
playing a really strong social
game and I really want to get people on
my side and believing they can trust me
Haley one vote Phil one vote Haley first
person voted out of Australian Survivor
brains versus brawn fil George has made
a big hooa at our first tribal that he's
not getting a go that no one's listening
to him or giving him a chance putting
his hand up at the very last minute for
a challenge that he's never going to win
is getting really frustrating for the
tribe haly trying to drag Chelsea and
the bag to the
Squig take the first point haly has
flick on the Run can she save
herself and she does
it one it's become very clear to me that
there are big players always making big
moves in this tribe a massive part of
this game is that you have to be able to
outwit people you have to be
strategic I'm a pain researcher that
means you get to manipulate the way
people are thinking it's really fun to
be out here and pretend to look
easygoing and not threatening
because floating in the middle is a nice
place to be but there's no way I came
here to just be a number for someone
else there is a hidden immunity idol on
the course today Haley right on his
tail doing haral breaks away
from haly got it I have an idol now and
I'm ready to blow up the game tribal
tonight will be fireworks there's a
clear hierarchy in this tribe making all
the calls and the rest of us are just
following along George is a big
Target but I've got some other
ideas finding the idol it does bring me
power and it makes me feel like I can
make big moves so tonight presents an
opportunity I'm going to take control of
the game and I'm going to do it without
using my idol tonight to te to go right
to the top
but for
Joey Joey is at the top of the alliance
he is like the Puppet Master running
this Camp so I've decided we could get
Joey out tonight I've got benen now I
need Rachel we and George to make this
happen picture of future
Behavior I mean that's basic human
psychology Joey leader of the cool kids
and watch you build your alliance up now
watch me break it down
Joey the plan came together and the king
of the cool kids Joey went home I'm not
a fan of dictatorships and I don't want
to play with people who are just going
to tell me what to do it's very clear to
me that there's going to be a Target on
my back now that I've made this move but
I have my idol at my sleeve so I know
I'm not going home anytime soon I never
expected I would be on the brawn tribe
in Australia Survivor the brawn have
been all about keeping
strength so it's not good that we're
outnumbered there are five original
Brawn flick Shannon Danny Chelsea and
Simon four original brain tribe way
Andrew bayen and myself I am able to
manage my Threat Level people look at me
and they don't think that I'm a really
strategic player but I'm switched on all
the time
that's C I had a letter from my mom and
from my sister and then one from my
boyfriend Jimmy I see a future with
Jimmy and would love to have kids and to
move back to Adelaide and to start a
family there bench day kind of code for
us for taking the next step in our
relationship and getting engaged so
let's see what happens but now I have
this to look forward to when I get home
lock it in and put it in the diary we
and Andrew have just won themselves
immunity
I have an
idol and I've got this
idea it's a big gamble the original
brains might actually have a whole lot
of power on this tribe there was a 54
split in this Swap and you guys have
made us feel really at home but um the
four of us have talked and we do want to
stick together with our vot um I've got
a idol that's burning a hole in my
pocket and I definitely plan to use it
tonight and so just to be transparent do
scissors paper rock on the
but and play it for me or
Baden kind of gives you a 50% chance of
hit us it's only me and B that they can
vote for so it means that they only have
a 50% chance of getting their vote right
we could go with Danny and Chelsea and
Simon and vote out
Shannon I see that Shannon is a bit of a
threat this peppero
okay not Shannon that's five votes
that's
enough at Tribal Council last night I
bluffed my idol and said that I would
use it that caused the majority to stop
fighting with each other and Shannon
went home and I've still got my idol in
my pocket perfect my God they just they
basically just gave us control of this
camp and they don't know that they did
it they think they made a great move it
was a terrible move with Shannon gone
flick is going to come to me and my goal
now is to bring flick into this new
alliance with Andrew bayen way and
myself but we not we're with you I
promise we're with you
yep Simon is painting this juicy Target
all over his back he's also really close
with Chelsea and with Danny but I don't
think brwn are as tired as they say they
are I've already seen some cracks
emerging and I'm pretty sure we could
drive a wedge into those cracks so you
can make you move against
time
um you want to be on board with that
like I'm going to need help to P it off
yeah yeah yeah um I'm all about um I'm
all about shaking it up you know Danny
tells me that she has this grand plan to
Blindside Simon he has two
Idols hearing that Simon has two idols
is terrifying it's low power for him if
he gets to M with two Idols I know we're
all screwed if Simon plays his Idol his
one vote on flick could mean that flick
is the one who will go home and I don't
want that I want it to be
Danny Danny thanks for doing all the leg
work on this blindsight against Simon
I'll take the Reigns now three vote
Simon one vote Danny one vote
flick 11th person voted out of
Australian Survivor brains versus Brawn
Simon I think I think that um I think we
all might have had a slightly different
plan what were you
thinking um I was thinking that um I
kind of want to hang with flick know how
was thinking but I saved flick today how
did you save her because I could have
written her name down yeah but didn't we
need a second person in case you idle
Danny's not happy that she was the split
boat last night she thought we were
working with her and Danny is someone
that you don't really want to cross
right now after merge I'm in a minority
the for brain that I went to trib SWOT
with and through Baden way and myself
we're going to bring on Laura but it
looks very clear to me that it is going
to be five of us brain in the minority
and everyone else is going to be against
us George comes in our Guardian Angel
he's planning to be a double
agent and we are going to have to trust
in George if we want to save our
cares found a hidden immunity
idol you guys are voting for cares play
the idol to Laura that's all I've
say time to put this Idol to use I have
a one in five shot of getting this
RI for
Laura
Laura does not
count 12th person voted out of
Australian Survivor brand versus
BR three immunity necklaces were up for
grabs and EMT Andrew and Danny won them
and then we found out that those three
are the only three casting votes at
tonight's
tribal there's no
play I'm feeling pretty mad because I've
helped him before and now he's giving me
absolutely nothing George is a double
agent I've still got game my only option
is to sell him down the river and maybe
that will save me tonight it was a
pretty lucky guess for me to get one in
five last
night probably more likely that somebody
told me exactly what the plan
was you're going to have to give me
names all right like for us I'll just
literally throw you under the bus it was
those two of course it was yeah
yeah I think I've actually gotten her to
want to work with me Danny has now
suggested that I work as a spy for her
and EMT in their Alliance George seems
to be talking to
everyone he's been boing me all
afternoon I'm worried that George is
continuing to smear my name he is
putting a Target on my back George and
Cara have been working on both
sides I would love to claim to be an
Oracle and to have known perfectly where
to play that Idol but I was told exactly
where to play it what's important is who
are you loyal to in the game of course
and everybody knows who I'm loyal spoken
like a true politician so am I lying or
am I not here's the question well you
know if you're lying haly am I I know
that I'm noty I'm not going to get
caught in it tick for tack all right you
are CAU in it and I don't think you have
a choice about that
haly Haley there two votes
Haley
Haley
Haley
Haley
Haley that's six votes that's enough
need to bring me your
torch time for you to go thanks guys
have
fun
yeah oh my God your torch may have been
snuffed but all is not lost follow this
path to Redemption Rock wait there and
prepare for your chance to re-enter the
game yeah I want
Redemption I feel like that was so
unfair all I did was tell the truth and
they voted me out George sat there and
lied and he's gone back to camp and that
doesn't feel fair to me
and Haley wins her spot back in the game
good job
guys last night I had to fight for my
chance to stay in this
game I went up against bayen a huge
endurance
athlete and I won I've come back into a
c where everyone has just voted me out
no one trusts me I can see that I tried
to jump to the B and they sold me down
the
river like all like you know I'm am
sorry to all of you that was it was not
the right thing to do strategically and
it was also not the right thing to do by
you my version of what Redemption looks
like is that I will not screw you guys
again like I don't want to do that
because I want to redeem myself in this
game and I think that that's what
Redemption looks like for
me Cara does not count' seen George
played that for
car I am pretty shocked about what
happened last night somebody has played
an idol like he's so strategic that if
he actually wanted the outcome to be
different he would have told us to split
the bones there are eight people left in
this game and we need to start thinking
about the best way to get to the end for
me the best way is to play double
agent I need both alliances to think
that I'm totally with them
flicks Hal
wins individual immunity first
individual immunity win saf Tribal
Council cannot be voted out I think the
immunity necklace around your neck makes
you more
powerful there are some clear threats in
this
game and this could be the perfect
opportunity to make a big move fifth
position in the alliance that doesn't
work for me I would never settle for
that I love and I breathe this game and
I want to win it's not often that you
get a shot at a big challenge Beast like
Emma
tonight could be a vote that completely
sets me up for the rest of this game EMT
that move last night certainly ruffled
some feathers around Camp right now I
think Andrew has felt like I have burnt
him one too many times Andrew he fall
in and Haley wins the
imunity
Andrew there's only six people left in
the game so everyone is starting to
think how can I win how can I make sure
that I am in that final two position I
could see youi and we and Danny working
together M there are a lot of different
ways to get to the end and I want to
make sure that I've explored all of them
fully I want them to think I'm 100% in
their plan and I want George and Cara to
think I'm 100% with them so that I have
all the information sitting in the
middle it's all about building
relationships and building trust so that
no one looks at me like a Target this
has been my Strate stry from the start
and that's working perfectly for me for
tonight's vote I'm back in the Middle
where I like to be me and we have all
the power to dictate who goes home
tonight 19th person voted out sixth
member of our jury Danny when I went to
the reward Danny and flick were trying
to bring me over to their side and they
were explaining that they would never
want to vote for George Cara and we at
the final tribal I had to do it because
Danny has the most friends on the jury
and she was a really strategic and
physical player but after last night
it's such a relief that Danny has gone
because she just wiped the floor with
all of us no it's true though anyone
loses next to Daniel Fleck and she
does Haley wins immunity she told me you
did she
really why cuz you would win in the
mie most luck flick doesn't want to go
up against me in the final challenge
what do you think are you tempted
to just take me
out looks like all votes are going to go
on me tonight it's a real dilem isn't it
but you can't give up you can never give
up in this game as long as there is a
way for me to stay I'm going to fight my
so I want George to know he needs me
here at the final three to win that
challenge and take him to the final two
it'll be suicide for you if I go tonight
because the next challenge flick is
going to win that and she will take Cara
she won't take you I I think it is
essential that we both vote car tonight
I would pitch to the two friends here
sitting without
necklaces if you take me out tonight
then the two of you will face up against
amazing flick and her challenged press
and you better hope she chooses you for
two and if she does you better hope you
win against her at the
end if you don't think that's going to
happen it's a pretty nice argument to
keep me in the
game car
I don't think you want my pitch tonight
but I'm hoping that George did one vote
Haley one vote Cara one vote George one
vote
left Cara I started watching this game
20 years
ago I have been researching and
preparing for this moment my whole life
and now I'm here I have a one in three
shot of being the sole survivor it is
unbelievable to think about I pinched
myself I am the perfect mix of brain and
brawn
that's a dangerous combination I know
what it takes to overcome pain I know
how to push myself to the edge and how
to get past
that and I'm willing to use all of that
knowledge to help me win today well done
Haley Haley wins
immunity and guarantees herself a spot
the final Tribal
Council flick
need to bring me a torch I grew really
close to flicking this game but it was
the only thing I could think to do to
give myself a chance to win this is the
moment I've been waiting
for yay top two let it P I have a
winning game because it encompasses all
aspects of Survivor I been incredibly
physical I took out four individual
immunity
necklaces I've played very smart
strategic moves and taking out big
players I started in the brain tribe and
I was in a majority Alliance but I
always knew what the minority Alliance
was doing and I had the power to swing
any of those votes when it came to the
vote for George I made a decision that I
wanted to swing and take out Joey found
myself with my public Community
Idol and that Idol that I found I
managed to play the maximal effect over
three different tribals
I ended up winning the immunity necklace
four times the most out of anyone here
if this game restarted right now with
the 11 people that are
here who do you think would work with
you on this jury right now I am going to
take almost the opposite approach to
George in saying that I feel like I
would work with all of you if I came
back in this game and I think that you
would all work with me because you all
wrote my name down and somehow I came
back and you still trusted me to work
with you I have the ability to adapt my
game and to get you to trust me even
when maybe you shouldn't

# Harry Hills, Dirty Harry




so not gonna lie out of all the people I
really just don't trust Laura she seems
way too smart for my liking she's having
a lot of chats with everyone she's got
that hat that just screams my boss and
so at this point she said biggest threat
to my game I'm sorry I'm just gonna vote
you out I'm gonna try it in some of
these people the right food right now is
just getting rid of it this is survivor
time to get your hands second person
voted out of Australian survivor Laura
the tribe has spoken
sure I have right now I'm not feeling
too great we've basically gone from
where the old contenders have this huge
lead now being a minority being five-o
champions against us for these champions
coming in they all have families which
means I have one last Hail Mary I've got
a girlfriend from Chicago almost three
next month
oh yeah I really like Harry you can tell
that he's just an absolute sweetheart
and real family man and the bloody food
guy
so yeah that's me it's funny because I
don't in fact have a child Oscar he is
not real at all but honestly my lives
have started to pay off all of these
girls just can't help but love me they
haven't worked out I'm the bad guy yeah
so my goal is to take the champions down
and win this game if I can survive this
then it means I'm very very well primed
for the end of the game I'm at this
reward and you're enjoying all the
sweets and my mind keeps straying
because it's pretty hard to believe the
contender went home last night on the
champions tribe they have a majority I
need to get back in control of my game
and need to form a new plan if I want
any chance of controlling the votes
going forward I need strength on my side
I basically need to find a hidden
immunity idol as soon as possible
congratulations your family in ability
not only could this save me in this game
but I'm a huge survival fan and just
finding this is such an accomplishment
I'm just so happy to have this in my
hands it's no one else's it's mine I
thought like it's me it's me gone and
now like I'm staying in this game so
just taking that side as much as
possible like when I'm doing the
gardening I show him stuff when I'm
cooking I like try and see if he like
wants to join me I've got a fake son
it's not real that much or Escrima yet
his name is Oscar Hudson Hills
no not Hudson his name is Oscar
Nathan Hills I watched a procession of
people go specifically to you one at a
time to listen to you as if you're some
sort of like Godfather figure no he said
your name was the country do you really
have a child I think what we've realized
tonight and anything that comes out of
Harry's nathas is something you should
gotta take with a grain of salt Tribal
Council basically could not have gone
any worse for me I made a huge move by
pissing off everyone so that they vote
for me so that I can play my idol and
get rid of Junaid but due to the twist
it completely failed the lines have been
drawn and right now it's a little
ice-cream man versus the big CEO
I'm and I'm the dog here but I still
have my hidden immunity idol I'm not
giving up Janene I like to call the God
my love is definitely in charge right
now Ross is a bit of a cowboy and tends
to say whatever he wants so I think out
of all the whole champions he's probably
the one that could have the loosest lips
and maybe the one that could give away a
few secrets and you don't have to give
me the specific name but like grab your
socks they've just bought it hook line
and sinker I've basically got them all
to put their votes on me then falling
into my trap if anyone has a hidden
immunity I want to play it now would be
the time to do so yeah I'm not much of a
gambling man and tonight is gonna be no
exception Harry does not count Harry
does not count Harry does not count the
person voted out of Survivor
Casey tribal spoken the old champions
tried to get rid of me
but I played my idol in case he was
voted out it's now down to me and Matt
left as the old contenders
we're completely outnumbered I'm 90%
send the old champions through the
challenge yesterday to get rid of me
traditionally in Survivor when the
hidden immunity idol is played the next
day another one will be placed somewhere
that I need to find another idol because
the second that we go to tribal they'll
just burn me out it's as simple as that
they can't get rid of me
congratulations you've found the clue to
immunity idol that is it back at your
camp the idol is consumed right in front
of your face stashed up hiring your
shelter
it's something about if anyone has a
hidden immunity idol you want to play it
now be the time to do so
I think they're gonna need something
better than the new cuz I'm not going
anywhere
miss for me any votes cast for Harry
will not count
first vote Harry does not count
Harry does not count Harry does not
count Matt the tribe has spoken
I've survived again another hectic
Tribal Council
it means that I'm the last old contender
left on this tribe like you in this game
I'm killable you're immune to death I've
made the old champions look foolish
let's be honest here we also suckered
Jeanine into playing her own idol which
means that she's threatened by me I know
she is well the old contenders are on
board with her Jeanine and ABI for a
vote to blindside day it's a huge huge
risk trustee the whole champions
I hope we're doing the right thing 15th
person voted I was traded survivor
second member of our jury
David six votes that's enough
David the tribe has spoken although we
were all United for the day but it
certainly feels like the champions have
reunited champion strong I'm the
underdog and I'm just gonna keep
fighting until they get rid of me which
they can't so far last night crazy
Tribal Council Daisy sent to exile she
is now waiting for one other person who
go to exile so they can Duke it out
one-on-one in an elimination challenge
but I have to make sure me going to
exile is not an option
it's five champions - two contenders
with Daisy on Exile but myself and Baden
have had chats with some of them that
made me think the champions could turn
on each other at any point priority
number one is getting champions to go
against champions make sense the plan
has slightly changed Abbie
once Simon gone
it's a great position I'm in to get to
the end of this game you need options so
I'm feeling really good right now
you should have listened to me the first
50 times I told you to start playing
second person sent to exile Beach Simon
the name of the game is survivor it's
outwit outplay outlast and honestly I'll
probably survive the harshest conditions
I've had my back up against the wall
more than anyone else there's been a lot
of close calls to me to the point where
the godmother called me the cockroach
because I'm unkillable Luke is the
number one threat and he'll definitely
have to go if anyone else stands a
chance of winning Luke wins immunity yet
again today his third total honestly
right now Luke is unstoppable Dirty
Harry still got some bullets left
we're not empty yet if I can take the
godmother out it would be this huge
feather in my cap the lady that
tormented me for two and a half weeks
finally going down at my hands it's time
that I get my blindside 19th person
voted out strange survivor sixth member
of our jury
Janine Janine the tribe explained last
night
Janine went home the godmother finally
blindsided said packing straight to the
jury like I finally got the scalp that I
wanted and on top of that it frees up my
game this top five looks good for me I'm
ready to finish this game because it's
five days left five people left and I
can see the end here the one person in
my way Harry come on over first
individual immunity how does that feel
incredible I mean it's like a dream to
win one of these ever
it's no secret tonight I'm burning look
my game plan has been laid out for
everyone it's get rid of the threads get
myself to the top at the exact right
time so I'm hoping and praying that Luke
goes home tonight
Luke try the spoken I'm ready to finish
this game because I'm actually now in
the box
6a width I'm the ultimate contender I
played this game hard I feel like I
played a better game than both of them
and I just need to prove that to the
jury at countless nicknames Dirty Harry
Harry Houdini the cockroach and I'm
gonna be sole survivor yeah okay yeah
can you help me get down please
after six hours and 40 minutes
Harry unbelievable okay once the vote is

area immediately
I'll read the vote 22nd person voted out
of Australian Survivor final member of
our jury
Harry need to bring me your torch

# Myles Kuah

When I found out it was Brains versus
Brawn, I was absolutely stoked because I
am right at home on the Brains tribe and
I'm ready to kick some brawn
ass. I'm a financial analyst dealing
with big money
clients. Some would say I'm a bit of a
freak in the sheets. I use a lot of
spreadsheets. I love working with
numbers both like in work and in life. I
also pole
dance. Uh it's one of my hobbies. I like
to
do. I love competition. I have had to
learn how to tone down my
competitiveness at board game
night. I'm a strategy nerd. I'm here to
prove that I can play the best game in
the world and play the best at it. Cuz I
I have been looking at you and been
like, "Yeah, I want to work with you."
Me, too. Yeah. Okay. Me, too. Cool.
Cool. There's some big boys, right? If
we go into swap and we end up on a
minority, we are the more obvious
targets who are the weakness that the
potentially color minority, right? I
love the brains tribe. There's a lot of
really quirky characters. I've gotten
along super well with all of them.
Everyone other than Ken. Obviously, as
you're aware, you haven't been having
like strat chats with people. I have no
interest in like blowing up your game.
Not even sure I have one yet. Are we
looking bad for you now? For me? Yeah. I
thought I was actually in a fairly
comfortable position, but apparently
not. Chill, bro. I'll keep working with
you, but just play it cool. Operation
play it cool.
I'm going to be not strat chatty. I'm
going to be hanging around the camp
being Mr. No strat and just hope that
the people that I get along with can
shove maybe one of the easier votes
under the bus. Miles. Miles. You got
through last night, but the skin of your
teeth. Yeah. So, what's your plan? Good
to know. My plan is wait until I hear a
name. To be honest, I don't think
there's a lot I can do as far as coming
up with new plans. Take a breath. Do you
know how to meditate? Close your Close
your eyes. My plan. I'm Don't listen.
Miles.
Miles. Miles. O. We should have put Max
in kicking just then.
Stupid decision. May. No. Miles said
he's a good kicker.
He says he's good at everything. Is it
Has it been proven yet?
Not yet.
Nice kick and he gets it in
and he does
it. Miles brings it home from range. It
may be the greatest day of my entire
life. I was hitting goal after goal like
Messi in a Champions League final.
Oh, I've had an absolute roller coaster
so far. I've been firmly on the bottom
of this tribe since the start of the
game, and I managed to scurry my way up
into what is a fairly solid position.
I've had some very good chats with Zara
and Karen, and they've assured me they
really want to work with me and AJ going
forward. Kalin so far has not been a big
strategic presence around the camp, but
Kalin is one of my closest allies in
this game. He proved that he wants to
work with me by warning me about the
first vote before anyone else did. And I
want to work with Kayla. I got to tell
you guys about the name that I came up
with for the alliance. The name I came
up with was the graduates because
there's a bunch of like high school BS
that's going on in this. And honestly, I
think that some of us are a bit above
it. Yeah. Come on. And honestly, if this
all goes to plan, this is our graduation
ceremony. I'm putting a lot of trust in
my very newly formed graduate alliance
to hopefully get me through this next
tribal.
Miles
Miles. Miles.
And I'm back on the brain. I'm back on
the brain tribe. Most of my allies are
over on the bronze. What a disaster. The
last couple of days have been really
hard. I have not felt like I've been
making strong social connections with
these ex prawns. Very interesting all of
that. Yeah,
I've spent a lot of time in this game on
the bottom and then even once I started
gaining a little bit of traction on
Brains 1.0, I got shunted in the swap to
the bottom of Brains 2.0. Wait, let's
just win the challenge and we can all be
safe. Wait, I got the idol. Let's go,
Bricks. Oh, bro.
It's
heavy. I'm going to play it for myself.
All
right. One more day in the game.
Miles does not count. Miles does not
count. Miles does not
count. Miles does not count. Feels
pretty good to survive another tribal
council. I was the only one who had no
idea what was going on yet again. The OG
brains all put their votes on me. Plus
one OG brawn, possibly PD and Max went
home. I suspect that Laura and Zara are
not happy with me. My strategy now is to
in the eyes of the OG Brawn sever any
ties that I have with the brains.
Kaylin's a really weird one cuz he kind
of just floated through the entire pre-
swap after AJ like who else is stirring
the pot of all the power? Logan just
because obviously she started with
Laura Zara Karen.
In reality, I'm straight back over with
AJ if we go to merge. I'm going to do
whatever it takes to survive. Miles.
Miles. Two votes. Miles. My strategy is
collecting data and finding success in
the patterns that other people
miss. I study physics in university. I
love being able to find truth by looking
at the underlying data, which can't lie
to you, and then figuring out this is
exactly what it's telling us. And there
it
is in all its beautiful
glory. Ain't it beautiful? Oh, I love
the way it looks on me. Oh, what is
that?
Check the shelf. What shop? What shop?
That shop there.
I start checking the shelf.
It's shelter. Check the
This is the ultimate advantage. It can
be used to steal an idol if I can figure
out who has one. Which means I now have
the potential to get two idols.
I think the jungle rat needs to be
renamed to the jungle dog cuz I'm out
here sniffing out advantages all over
the place.
I've been very good at playing the
humble poor little guy stuck on the
bottom, but in reality, I am at the top
of the tribe. The legend of the jungle
rat continues on. I really feel like
playing from the bottom has put me in a
better position with regards to how to
play. Oh yeah, 100%. Put me on the
bottom in this tribe and I'll flourish.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Put you on the bottom
in a lot of situations. I reckon you'll
flourish. Are you tempting me? Are you
coming on to me?
There was only one idol currently known
about in the game today, which is
Christian.
Did Kristen play your idol? Is she still
got him? Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Molly has no allies and I'm in a great
position to scoop him up as an extra.
It's fantastic for my game. There will
be a name given to you and it's a great
opportunity to like, you know, put a
little bit of trust. I didn't come here
to play a simple and boring game.
I'm vote. Ah, wait. Hold on, Jono.
It allows me to potentially steal an
idol. Whose idol you want to take?
Kristen, I'm really
sorry. Uh, Jonathan
I have just come into possession of a
new little bit of hardware. Uh, but
there's a sexy little snake on the
corner who's in a bit of hot water. So,
I'm going to play this for Paulie.
No. Oh my god. Thank you so
much, Mile. Polly does not
count. Brains versus born. PD.
Sorry, PD, but I want to find myself a
new buddy. The snake and the rat. Paulie
had no one. He owes me his life and he
knows it. This is unreal. Now I've got
him as a locked in number. I am your
total number two. I will never write
your name down. Unfortunately for
Paulie, I don't see him in my long-term
plans. I feel like AJ is like my
janitor. Like I've made this massive
mess and AJ's been left to clean it up.
What it means is that I can play a
little bit chaotically and get away with
it. That Logan has an idol. My plan is
to get Logan out with an idol in her
pocket. Logan is someone who rubs a lot
of people the wrong way. I sit here on
my throne. I'm having the best time out
here I could be. I am living the
absolute survivor dream.
At the start of the game, you wanted to
vote me out because you thought I was a
threat and you were scared of me.
Well, you were right to be scared.
I would keep my head low if I was
you. But here I regroup when you have
time to have proper conversations. The
jungle rat is back onto the bottom of
the tribe, but he is not without power.
I have my hidden immunity idol. Didn't
think you could take down the jungle rat
that easily, did you?
I'm going to play that for myself
tonight, Jonathan.
Okay. Miles does not count. Miles does
not count. Miles does not count. Racking
up the numbers. Miles does not count.
Miles does not count.
The people have started a revolution and
usurped the rat king. And I'm now back
to a lowly jungle rat at my usual spot
at the bottom of the tribe. Pick up on
what your plan is. We may just have the
same plan. Come along. Okay. I know what
yours is. What's Okay, what's yours?
Stop. Okay. Cut with the
it's turning into a big mess and I don't
want to get our lines crossed. Uh, can I
just tell you a tribal? I promise. No, I
No, because I need to understand whether
my plan is just dead in the water. Your
plan's dead? Yeah. Okay, cool. Cool.
Cool. It's just you and me, Miles. Yeah.
What do you want to chat about? I don't
know. You got any jokes? Oh,
I think this is a bit of a joke at the
moment. Miles,
I can't catch a break. I've battled
through this game every step of the way,
and I don't give up.
the jungle rat. My fourth for the
season, which if I am correct, I think
is an Australian survivor record.
Okay. Wait, cool. Us postgrads, AJ,
Kalin, Zara, and I are playing just dump
four on Logan. I think to be a memorable
player, you do have to take big risk.
What people remember is moves, is
moments. I trust in our group of four
and I think we've got the guts, we got
the conviction and the nerve to go to
rocks for each other. Listen, AJ and I
AJ and I are the biggest psychopaths on
this cast. We will go to rocksware. And
the fact is the numbers are 32 on your
side, right? Which means you guys have a
60% of it a chance of coming out on the
lower end of that. Logan is both a very
strong endurance threat and also built
up a very solid resume and along with
having like people who she's worked with
on that jury. Day 40 in sunny Samoa
and I am absolutely over the moon.
definitely riding a bit of a high after
last night's tribal
because I am in a very powerful
position. We went to threaten rocks, but
the girls, they lacked the coahones.
They lacked the guts and the conviction
they needed. So, Logan went home at the
end of the day, and that is fantastic
for my game. The graduates have a four
strong alliance and a tribe of seven.
And then you got the three girls on the
other side. No opportunities in sight.
She didn't actually pitch me any name.
Bit of a Mexican standoff. He didn't
give me a name. I didn't give him a
name. Why should I budge for Miles?
Well, because you're saying that you
think that we should move over and jump
to you. I never said that. You just said
I didn't scratch with you. Listen, you
didn't pitch me a name. And you didn't
pitch me what? I don't need to pitch you
a name. We have a name.
Miles.
Miles. Miles. Three names come out and I
was nervous. Tribal went fantastically.
We had a target. We had a plan and we
executed it. Kristen is gone. Everyone
realized that she was playing the game
harder than it looked and so she became
target number one for our postgraduates
alliance. Sorry, Morgan. Love you girl.
Miles. Miles. I was thinking we could go
for AJ at
5, which would leave Kayn, Kate, you,
me, and I think Kayn would go for Kate
at four. I'm basing this vote on my read
that Zara wants to take me to final two.
If I'm correct, then this is the correct
play. Like, tribal, don't do anything
insane. Don't spook them. Don't do a
jungle rat. Yeah. Just be smart.
One of the hardest things about getting
this late into the game is that I'm with
a bunch of people that I love. AJ and
Kalin are two people that I'm not
planning to take to the end. And they
have been my two closest friends out
here. I'm going to have to ruin their
dreams. They all have the same dream as
me, which is to win the title of Soul
Survivor. And I'm gonna have to take
that away for them if I want to win.
It's not fair. It's not fair.
Uh, I think I'm safe tonight, but you
know, I don't want to go home with a
Samoan souvenir, so let's make it four
for the season.
Okay, I'm going to play it for myself.
Fair enough.
Miles does not count. I would have been
like, "Okay, let's go to three, but
let's have a fair fight." like we can
still do that if you're interested. I
think I think you're very cooked now.
And he does.
Miles fulfills his survivor dream and
wins individual immunity.
What's the feeling? Honestly, I can't
believe it. It's like obviously last
night was very emotional tribal and I
think I was probably in a bit of trouble
uh today if I didn't win this thing and
just to pull it off like that is just
best feeling in the world. I actually
can't believe I came out today. I
absolutely put in my all and I have won
my first bloody immunity
necklace. Guaranteeing myself a chance
to have a go at that final endurance
challenge is just it's just amazing.
It's just a Survivor fan's dream.
Today's scramble is like being a hot
girl at a bar on a Friday night. You can
sit in the hammock as well if you want.
See, everyone's coming up, buying me
drinks, and wanting to have a chat so
that they can get to know me and I can
take them through to tomorrow. Zara, I
gave you an offer at the last tribal
council, and you refuse. All the way
through this late game when I've been
talking to people about who they see as
the biggest threats in this game,
everyone says AJ. There's a reason why I
have 26 votes against
me. It's because a big part of it has
been because of sloppy gameplay at
various
times. And I know that there's
definitely jurors up there who don't
necessarily respect the way that I've
played the game. Congratulations, Kayn
and Miles. You are the final two. You've
gone as far as you can go in this game.
And now I'm sitting here at the end with
the chance to win.
Not only that, I've done it with bullets
flying at my head every single step of
the way. I have rubbed a lot of people
the wrong way. I have a lot of work to
do. I know that with the right pitch, I
can win over this jury with my
game. Kalin better buckle up because
he's in for a roller coaster tonight.
The way I see it, the reason why I
deserve to be winner is because of
opportunities. I took risks in this
game. I swung at a lot of pitches and I
missed some of them, but some of them
were home
runs. You all know the struggles that
I've had throughout this game. I played
from the bottom for a long time. I did
it for longer than anyone else did in
the game. I took all the heat. I ended
up with 26 votes while AJ ended up with
four and Kalin ended up with one because
I was the one taking the heat and I
could take it. But I also played the
most idols correctly. Being able to play
them correctly. Now, that requires a bit
of skill because there's people that go
home with an idol in their pocket. Well,
I used my idols to the best of their
effect. And there was a lot of luck that
I got along the way. I took that luck
and I made really good opportunities out
of it. And I think that's what's
important is not relying on idols, but
it's about what you do afterwards
because this game has luck and you can't
control your own luck. I think I have
controlled my luck in this game.
I never relied on luck. I would say that
the person who folds their hand
consistently in poker will often make it
deep into the tournament, but they're
not the one that wins. The person who
wins is the one that when he gets a hand
that is a great hand for him. He goes
allin and sometimes the cards don't come
out favorably. Sometimes the cards do.
There's chance in these games and it's
the person who uses that chance to the
best of their ability. Miles.
Miles. Two votes. Mile Miles. Three
votes. Miles Miles. Four votes Miles.
One vote Caleb. Winner of Australian
Survivor Brains versus Brawn. Miles.

# Feras Basal

I can be mistaken for being this dumb
big Arab from Western
Sydney uh that's the complete opposite I
work in Human Resources but I'm the
person that manipulates emotions and I
know how to pull on heartstrings as well
was the closest thing we had to an Arab
being on TV and we loved it I'm here to
finish what he couldn't do my first
night in Camp was absolutely horrible
guys we're doing a full moon do
do never get this again worst night ever
probably got around 30 minutes of sleep
I thought I was going to struggle the
most with food on the island that is not
the case I take that back please slap me
in my face if I ever say that again had
Tobias and Sarah having their little
sandwich it was also Alex and Peter this
sandwich wasn't very
is
re with a bain tonight there will be a
line drawn in the sand and queens
they're all going to be dethroned and
I'm going to love it worst case scenario
tonight is Peter whips out an idol and
the cuddle crew realize how many people
have betrayed them I feel
like some of us need to be put in our
place a bit
some people need to be made an example
out
of
Peter that's five votes that's enough I
need to know what's in this bloody
box if if it's that hard to get into
there must be something in there that
could really change up the
game Garrick and Raymond I trust them
fully but I'm also crapping
myself pment another
key hold this hold this that's an
idol open open open a bloody idle
baby what we
F slimy slimy Alex catches me red handed
I can't there's no way about hiding it
what how are you feeling about HBY I
know I'm probably doing a
heading it's so stupid I heard a swing
tonight I don't know if I can trust them

this bad boy or
not I really hope it's not here going
home

unfortunate I have to give a
buck I would love to play this for me

great the reason it doesn't matter we
name down but sensitive T it's not
sensitive I'm just saying factual that's
all exactly it's proper facts she didn't
write her name down part of that ver was
my plan it doesn't matter what was your
plan it doesn't matter his V because you
can't get my name out of your mouth for
some odd
reason I think you
should eighth person voted out Titans
versus Rebels Garrick that's five votes
that's enough wait so okay so who voted
for Garrick I'm I'm still I was like
trying to count and Kelly I don't know
who voted for Kelly I don't know the OG
Titans voted with Kirby's Al Lions they
lied to my face sitting in a minority at
the moment I need to just lay low sing
by with everyone but I have revenge in
my heart I want every single OG titan
head on the spike the opposing Alliance
is
airtight and we don't have that much
time to find the little cracks I
wouldn't want to vote for an OG Rebels
just in
case oh I've got a list all right it's
just unfortunately I can only write one
name down win of
VCH all three of those guys I want them
gone three on
Ferris three on alen Ferris will look

on board with that I really feel like a
mafia boss right now I really do 12th
person voted out of Titans versus
Rebels

tired this is how it's going to work
Eden and Raymond you will not vote
versus
Rebels
Eden read you guys like a bloody
book um
I can't tell you how sorry I am last
night's Tribal Council was textbook
survivor Play for my it was funny seeing
Raymond's name being called out one by
one and they looked quite confident
second they saw Eden's name he went from
this
to ien has become my strategic
partner we should have a she is almost
like my editor in surv
every plan I come up with she's the one
that approves it are you open to to
working together I am because I I
seriously have I still have okay be a
top three with me you and kitty honestly

dangerous
seriously cck
coconut frond exactly I would love to
get
V to see her would be amazing with Kirby
to send bow home oh yes yes yes yes yes
Raymond Raymond
Raymond this might possibly be one of
the most dangerous things in this game
and I love it either everyone writes
down Raymond's name and Raymond
successfully gets to choose someone to
go home or not everyone writes down
Raymond's name and Raymond end up going
home it's back in looking very
serious
takes out
Mark you the Oscar and
supporting I hope nobody takes advantage
of this situation I just want to make
sure this is completely unanimous
because Raymond wants this last thing
for it to be I'm his
name
Valaria to make a Cleveland I did not
know and I feel like I'm successful in
that's F solid really solid Andra on
Kitty and car Kirby on her high horse
thinking of that we're the biggest
players in the game and we need to
protect each
other but who do you think is holding
the power right now I am in the shadow
of
Kirby for now Raymond is right if Kirby
makes it to the end then you can all
kiss your half a million dollars goodbye
and I've been investing in Kitty and
Caroline now is when you strike at rir
and kiry and I know that she would have
pitched an all girls Alliance to
Caroline she never told me that but I
know that that's what she would have
done you and kitty all girls arei and
that they're going to take out M and um
she wants
to take you out I tried my luck with
this female empowerment Alliance and
that was the case that Kirby tried to
pitch to
them and I was right who do you want I
you can take your
Pi if wins if re wins it's Kirby if
Kirby wins it's R voted out fifth member
of our jury Rihanna that's four votes
that's enough don't crumble on the oh my
God Kirby feels like an older sister we
think alike extremely similar our human
our strategy our upbringing which is why
I love working with her I'm being dead
set curs I want to be sitting next to
you I just want a chaseburg so
badly to see that Mark and Caroline are
looking for an idol honestly it makes me
extremely nervous and then I remember
lightl
moment I have the remains of my second
Idol that I found my idol has saved me
through more than a dozen tribal
councils I find the
idol I'll fix it up and I'll print it
someone somewhere where they they're
around you literally go and find
them what I need from you carine and I
need to know y tomorrow y when it comes
down to me you Raymond and Mark promise
me you'll write down Mark's name yeah
Caroline is definitely someone I can use
to get to the end kby feels like my
older sister he made a proper sibling
connection with her sit next to her
again you'd be the most competitive for
me I want to beat the best of the
best I am the person that
holds her fate in my hands I realized
today that Kirby's fate lies within this
Idol
we've had our ups and downs you're like
a sister to me and I thought he was
going to be simple I haven't been
backing myself I think tonight I'm
backing
myself I like to play this for me of our
jury
Kirby only person I'm extremely
confident that won't write my name down
is Raymond Raymond and I have really
really stuck by each other and I respect
Raymond's loyalty and he respects my
loyalty I'm pinky promising you right
now I'm writing R's Man Down
okay there's only so much that you can
do to protect them for as long as you
can do you know what I
mean Raymond the tribe has spoken I've
always fallen short from that necklace
I'm wearing that necklace tonight Ferris
wins final
immunity
was guaranteed a one in two shot at
winning the title and the half million
dollars that goes with it you still have
a big decision to make 22nd person voted
out final member of our jury Mark last
night I sent Mark packing to the jury
because I felt like our line would be
easier up to beat there's a huge weight
on my
shoulders I'm doing this for my
religion I am doing this for my
wife I'm doing this for Western Sydney
do you think you played with the courage
that you voiced you know
what I think it's extremely hard
especially in such a fluid season but
something that I could definitely claim
is bluffing my
idol and that got me out of a lot of
possible votes where my name could have
been written down that I held I had for
31 days wrapped up the idol and I gave
it to Ray and I said let's plant this
Idol in front of Mark in front of
Caroline so that they can see you
holding an idol going to be safe but
you're also going to be safe I am
extremely confident in how I've played
this game I'm the one who sent Kirby to
the jury I've been at the bottom so many
times I've been at the top been in the
middle I always told myself leave
emotions out of the
game I was such a Cutthroat player in
the beginning and I evolved there are so
many different ways you can make it in a
place like Australia you don't need to
be a doctor or an engineer or a bloody
lawyer and although the title of Soul
Survivor
would make me so proud winning the
$500,000 for me is genuinely
life-changing
ferris
ferris ferris there's three votes
Ferris
FIS that's four votes feris winner of
Australian Survivor Titans versus
Rebels
FIS you are soulle Survivor Titans
versus Rebels well
done
yeah

# Liz Parnov

I'm Liz and I'm an Olympic pole vaulter
oh and we're both tourists yes we can be
like the two evil blonde twins Taurus
Terrors we're not evil we're beautiful
lovely kind-hearted yes okay is this
where I have to formally ask you will
you be in an alliance with me I would
love to if Jackie and that are there
Jackie if they're not there Angela
first person voted out of Heroes versus
Villains Anjali
Johnny and I I honestly feel like we're
the same person in like two different
bodies I feel like you and I are
dominating
the same I feel like we're running this
show no
it feels like I've got a sister here
with me which I'm so grateful for
it's really nice to have someone I can
genuinely Trust
I became the youngest ever Paul Walter
at the Olympics when I was 18.
my parents moved to Australia from
Russia looking for a better future for
their children I find their sacrifice
empowering and so when I'm competing I'm
in the zone I'm not there to make
friends I'm focusing on myself
like I've gone to the Olympics twice but
I'm a Villain at times when it's
necessary I explode and I show my
emotions I just say it how it is I'm
very black and white because I wear my
heart on my sleeve
don't give up let's go guys
now let's take the next round
who will listen copy that
you're playing way too strong bruh
second person voted out of Heroes versus
Villains Michael
maybe it was like she just shoved that
time in the foreign
yes no someone's hand did go into the
cookie jar and I saw it so I'll see you
know
third person voted out of Heroes versus
Villains Mimi
that's five votes that's enough Liz
are you surprised to see Rogue gone
absolutely not I'm actually quite glad I
don't have to cross paths with her just
getting rid of Sarah
actually yes
and she has the gift of the gab if she
makes it a tribe swap she can befriend
and talk to absolutely anyone I think
it's Sarah
Sarah the sweetest girl is always the
biggest threat
of Heroes versus Villains Sarah
it's just Simon
loves to be the leader and authority and
control
I'm I'm personally fed up with it
Jerry's told us a few secrets and
Whispers
and I feel quite confident in trusting
Jerry you've worked it out very quickly
yeah he's a really lovely guy like I
think he's the newest member of the
Spice Girls just keep your feelings out
yeah yeah George's Scary Spice Shawnee
is Posh Spice I'm Sporty Spice
Jerry can be old spikes
I may be 107 years old but I swear if
there was a bit good good
Shawnee and Liz
I'm going now
if we do lose I'm worried if I get back
to the heroes tribe and I feel secure
and Liz on the other hand doesn't then I
will give this Idol to her I am feeling
really exposed without Shawnee
I miss her so much like
I'm gonna get upset
Shawnee and I have just grown
so close over the last few weeks
she's like a sister to me we've just
formed this like incredible Bond and I'm
feeling really like the heroes have come
into this tribe and just pushed myself
Simon and Geordie aside they're just so
tight thankfully with Jordy I have that
one person that I can rely on and I know
that I can trust but
we feel like sitting darks have you guys
made any roads I've been trying Simon
has his Idol and he said he's willing to
share it between the three of us but I
know for a fact that he's too selfish to
do that but
in this instance we do need him as a
number
and my friend just taken
and what they're talking about no
Simon's running around scrambling and
it's so obvious how desperate he is and
I definitely feel like I'm at the bottom
of the pack the advantages of me being
on the outs I've definitely taken a step
back I've let the boys feel like this is
their camp and they run the show that's
just allowed me to be a bit more
reserved excluded I can do my own thing
and no one is missing me as such
so I can sneak off
it's too much
I am like so done being on the bottom of
the pecking order with these Alphas
foreign
changes everything I'm so excited I
could cry at the immunity challenge the
plan is to tell Shawnee that we need her
Idol because two is better than one
nice I have one as well
okay okay I'm gonna come to you
guys yeah and go now is the time yeah
really okay
if I see whispering and stuff
and then we can just change over
the old villains are in the minority
tonight is that a concern
uh yes it is
nice person voted out of Heroes versus
Villains
Jordy
four votes that's enough can you bring
me a torch planned backfired last night
at tribal instead of getting rid of Sam
they got rid of my best mate Jordy was
my guy over here and he's gone
and I'm now on this villains tribe as a
lone wolf
show each other our Idols oh yeah I've
got mine right here
it's good to see he's actually in there
yes it's actually in there I'm not a
liar
yeah
there you go
what are you shaking your head for
you're an absolute liar
I know you don't have one
you have
you buy to me like multiple times over
the last little little bit you didn't
have an idol
live to Jordy and I and
Liz
is
Liz
you're no longer a villain
take off your buff
toss it in the fire
I'm going to give you a new buff
congratulations you are now a hero
welcome welcome welcome
um
strategically it's worse for us real
quick and again I'm beginning to feel
annoyed
in an alliance you have to give and take
but George is a very dominant
personality
he likes to you know be the leader of
the group that is a big problem before
previously I know that there are twists
and turns at every moment and I was on
the bottom for about eight consecutive
boats in a row I know how it feels I
know how it feels when everyone's
talking and you're not involved in the
competition oh
11th person voted out of Heroes versus
Villains Stevie they're throwing your
name up
all right well I mean there's only one
way you're not nervous
yeah out of yourself the fact that we
have an idol as a safety net is great
but I don't know if Dave is trying to
trick me so they can get rid of Johnny
or George
hello
all right who do you want to play it for
Shawnee Shawnee
is Liz
are you sure you want to do it
Shawnee
Johnny okay
all right
Shawnee does not count
Shawnee does not count
Shawnee does not count Shawnee does not
count
Liz that's one vote Liz oh
David
12th person voted out of Heroes vs
villains
David
that's five votes that's enough
forming a friendship where we would like
hang out on the outside and now I feel
like I've been like cheated on or like
mugged off by what you've said I'd like
when you got back to camp
quite funny actually it's interesting
how one day you're on the bottom getting
told what to do without a voice and then
the next day you're on top yeah
we're down to four guys oh my God good
luck guys good job guys
she's got it I think she looks so solid
that I was willing to play my idol for
flick
so yeah it does Sting when I'm willing
to drop my idol for someone that I see
value in playing the game with and then
they turn around and say actually no
member of our jury click
six folks that's enough
you can't take the villain out of the
shoes
Shawnee
that's okay can you bring me a torch the
day spa reward is just what we needed
we're getting lit we're sculling the
champagne we're going to clean ourselves
up and then get a plan together to take
out Haley we'll talk when we get there
I've got a lot to say
if you're gonna get rid of people from
the game you may as well do it looking
cute since George blindsided my bestie
Shawnee absolutely I like the look of
this but I need to form a new alliance
to get me to the end game 17th person
voted out fifth member of our jury
Haley that's not how it is though the
only reason you're saying that is
because you haven't been in the alliance
and the reason you haven't been in the
alliance because you've learned every
single bridge and people have practices
you're aligned because of your actions
I'm walking around behind my back
pulling me a pawn well yeah I'm not
gonna work with you and you will be
alone because say to my face
you know what I was gonna say this is
the jury
I don't have a problem with calling you
a pawn to your face or behind your back
yes
Chief person voted out sixth member of
our jury
Simon
at Tribal Council last night I saw that
George has become extremely close to
Jerry
not only do we have a relationship a
friendship but he's also a great mentor
and that's that's honest that's one of
the nicest things someone's ever said
about
yeah but it's true
that's massive threat to me
I know that George will never turn on
Jerry
just need to win immunity are you going
to win the next break
but he's not as close to Matt
is a massive challenge through it
say that he's my number one competitor I
know that if he makes it to that final
immunity challenge
he will win
so I want to get rid of Matt tonight
doesn't have individual immunity because
if he gets to the end he's getting the
jury votes
and he's winning that final Challenge
and I think that he'll take Jerry yeah
100
individual immunity
it's okay just not
him
for here we are George new cat Matt and
now I'm screwed
I'm pretty pissed with George right now
I fully was committed to the jacuzzi
Alliance
and he voted out Nina who was going to
get me and George to final two the bond
that Matt Jerry and George have is
ridiculous like it's bordering weird
they are like family I don't know how I
could possibly break them up I think
I've proved to myself and to everyone
else here that I am a challenge threat
I'm focused and I know that it is
essentially a life or death challenge
for me so no matter what it is I'm gonna
put my body on the line
at least just one you won
four wins final individual immunity
I am in the top three and it feels
bloody good it is such a special moment
for me
absolute amazing effort if I didn't win
this final challenge Matt Jerry and
George were sending me to the jury bench
tonight my wicked wicked plan is to send
George to that jury bench
George has blindsided me three times in
this game
and this is my moment to take revenge on
George
20th person voted out final member of
our jury
George
I came into the game of Survivor as a
physical threat being a two-time
Olympian
I won the reward challenge for the
villains when the boys couldn't pull
through
I won the day spa reward and I won three
individual immunity necklaces
last night's necklace was the most
important because it put me on this
bench tonight to pitch to you all
to lean on returning players such as
George Simon Shawnee and Jordy from the
villains to absorb their information to
absorb their strategy and make it my own
strategic Powerhouse
I had the shoes Alliance I had the Spice
Girls I had the Vigilantes and I had the
jacuzzi Alliance
in order to have all of these alliances
I had to make genuine connections with
all of you
Georgie pie you have played an
incredible game
but when you crossed me I made it my
mission to make sure that I came after
you
you took Shawnee away from me
you took Shawnee off the jury bench
because you knew that if I was sitting
here that was my vote
and then you took Nina away from it
and that broke up the jacuzzi Alliance
right if I'm going to take George down
this has to be the perfect moment and
you know when that moment was George
that was last night
many of you have tried to take George
down
but I did that that was my move
I'm so proud of myself and what I've
achieved and the hurdles I've overcome
and no matter what happens tonight I'm a
winner
because this whole experience has
changed my life
Liz
Liz Liz
winner of Australian Survivor Heroes vs
villains
Liz
yay
