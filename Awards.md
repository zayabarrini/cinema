## 🧨 Critiques of the Oscar Voting System

| **Issue**                                 | **Description**                                                                               | **Examples / Impacts**                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎭 **Bias Toward Prestige Genres**        | Heavy preference for dramas, biopics, war films, and period pieces.                           | Comedies, horror, and sci-fi often ignored.                                                         |
| 👴 **Lack of Diversity (Until Recently)** | Historically white, male, older membership skewed results.                                    | #OscarsSoWhite (2015–16), lack of Black or queer recognition.                                       |
| 🇺🇸 **Anglo-American Bias**              | Non-English films rarely win top prizes unless there's major international buzz.              | *Parasite* was the first non-English Best Picture (2020).                                           |
| 🧾 **Overemphasis on Campaigning**        | Studios spend millions lobbying voters, often outweighing merit.                              | *Shakespeare in Love* over *Saving Private Ryan* (1999)                                             |
| 🔍 **Opaque Process**                     | Voting processes are not fully transparent, including committee decisions in some categories. | Controversy over *To Leslie* nomination (2023).                                                     |
| 🎥 **Favoring Established Names**         | Newcomers often overlooked, while veterans are nominated for lesser work.                     | “Career Oscars” given late in life.                                                                 |
| 📽 **Voting Without Viewing**             | Some voters don't watch all eligible films.                                                   | Confirmed anonymously by multiple members to major outlets (e.g., The Hollywood Reporter, Variety). |

While genre classifications can be subjective, the following table provides an approximate count of Best Picture winners by genre up to 2024:

| Genre           | Number of Best Picture Wins |

| Musical         | 10                          |
| Biopic          | 9                           |
| Historical Epic | 8                           |

| Science Fiction | 1                           |

*Note: Some films may fall into multiple genres; counts are based on primary genre classification.*

Dramas have historically dominated the Best Picture category, reflecting the Academy's preference for serious, character-driven narratives. War films and musicals also have a strong presence, especially during certain periods in cinematic history. Genres like fantasy and science fiction have been less frequently recognized, though exceptions like "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" (2003) and "Everything Everywhere All at Once" (2022) have broken through, indicating a gradual broadening of the Academy's recognition of diverse genres.

These trends highlight the evolving tastes and cultural values within the film industry and among audiences over the decades.
