## ACT I

### SCENE 1  
**INT. KITCHEN – AFTERNOON**  

Close on a pair of hands scrubbing a blackened pan. The sound of metal against metal is harsh, repetitive.  

MARTA (40s), tired eyes, hair tied in a loose bun, keeps scrubbing as if the action could erase something invisible.  

  MARTA  
  (whispering)  
  Deus é meu apego quando meus filhos estão na estrada.  

The noise of the sponge echoes in the empty kitchen.  

---

### SCENE 2  
**INT. LIVING ROOM – NIGHT**  

ROBERTO (50s), drunk, bursts in. He slams the TV off with one hand and drops onto the armchair.  

  ROBERTO  
Desliga essa porcaria! Vocês não fazem nada direito nessa casa!  

Silence. His shirt clings with sweat. The distant echo of bar laughter lingers.  

---

### SCENE 3  
**EXT. YARD – MORNING**  

Wide shot. CAMILA (20s) and LIA (18) wrestle in the dirt. Hair tangled, clothes ripped.  

MARTA rushes out, broom in hand, trying to separate them.  

  CAMILA  
Você sempre quer tudo pra você!  

  LIA  
Mente! A mãe só gosta de mim!  

Chickens scatter. The broom scrapes against dry earth.  

---

### SCENE 4  
**INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT**  

DÉBORA (30s) sits at a desk. Close on notebook pages: “falo, gozo, angústia, ciúmes.”  

She stops writing, listening to muffled screams from the other room.  

  DÉBORA  
  (to herself)  
Travessia da fantasia. Relatos de análise.  

The pen scratches again.  

---

## ACT II

### SCENE 5  
**EXT. HIGHWAY – DAY**  

A truck speeds down the road. REGIANE (20s), wild hair flying, stands on the back, arms stretched open.  

DÉBORA watches from the roadside, silent, notebook in hand.  

  REGIANE  
Uhuuuul! Vamos, mundão!  

  DÉBORA  
  (softly)  
Humilhação. Sacrifício.  

The truck disappears into the horizon.  

---

### SCENE 6  
**INT. BEDROOM – LATE NIGHT**  

Darkness. The only light comes from a monitor.  

Close on GUSTAVO (16), pale, withdrawn, eyes locked on a violent game. His fingers twitch on the controller.  

No dialogue. Just the sound of gunfire and digital explosions.  

He throws the controller against the screen. Crack. Silence.  

---

### SCENE 7  
**EXT. BAR – NIGHT**  

Wide shot. Tables full of men laughing. Bottles clink.  

ROBERTO stands among them, swollen face, red eyes, telling a story.  

  ROBERTO  
E aí eu disse, “se não é hoje, não é nunca!”  

The men explode in laughter, slamming the table.  

---

### SCENE 8  
**INT. HOUSE – EARLY MORNING**  

MARTA sweeps the dirt yard, muttering prayers. REGIANE storms in from the road. CAMILA and LIA chase each other through the doorway.  

Chaos builds. Marta tries to hold them apart.  

  MARTA  
Basta! Vocês vão acabar se matando!  

The broom breaks in her hands.  

---

## ACT III

### SCENE 9  
**INT. EMPTY ROOM – DAWN**  

A bare room. Five women stand: DÉBORA, MARTA, REGIANE, CAMILA, LIA. The camera circles slowly around them.  

They breathe heavily, eyes bloodshot, clothes torn.  

  DÉBORA  
O que se atravessa não é o real.  
É o resto.  
O gozo que sobra.  
A dor que não cessa.  

Silence. A chicken crows faintly in the distance.  

FADE OUT.

## NOTES  
- Expandable into ~100 pages: repetition of domestic tasks, cyclical violence, intercut with surreal imagery (sacrifice, animals, broken objects).  
- Experimental structure: long takes, silences, voice-over reflections from Débora.
