# The Banshees of Inesherin
Well, where is he? Just sittin' there.
Sittin' there doin' what?
Sittin' there doing nothin'.
Smokin'.
Have ye been rowin'?
I don't think we've been rowin'.
Sounds like ye've been rowin'.
It does sound like we've been rowin'.
Will I try him again?
That'd be the best thing.
Howdo, Padraic.
Sit somewhere else.
Huh?
Uh... But I have me pint there, Colm.
He has his pint there, Colm, from when he came in and ordered his pint from before.
Okay.
I'll sit somewhere else, so.
Are ye rowin'?
I didn't think we were rowin'.
Well, ye are rowin'.
Well, ye are rowin'.
He's sittin' outside on his own like a whatchamacallit.
It does look like we're rowin'.
Well, I suppose
I'd best go talk to him, so.
See what all this is fecking about.
That'd be the best thing.
Now I'm sittin' here next to you, and if you're goin' back inside,
I'm followin' you inside, and if you're goin' home,
I'm followin' you there, too.
Now, if I've done somethin' to ya, just tell me what I've done to ya.
And if I've said somethin' to ya, maybe I said somethin' when
I was drunk, and I've forgotten it, but I don't think I said somethin' when
I was drunk, and I've forgotten it.
But if I did, then tell me what it was, and I'll say sorry for that too, Colm.
With all me heart, I'll say sorry.
Just stop running away from me like some fool of a moody schoolchild.
But you didn't say anything to me.
And you didn't do anything to me.
That's what I was thinking, like.
I just don't like you no more.
You do like me.
I don't.
But you liked me yesterday.
Oh, did I, yeah?
I thought you did.
Padraic.
Dominic.
What's the matter with ya?
There's nothing the matter with me, for God's sake.
Look at this I found.
A stick with a hook.
What would you use it for, I wonder?
To hook things that were the length of a stick away?
Oh, be off to the pub now, Padraic, if you're gonna be annoyin' us.
I don't have to be down there every night, do I?
ColmSonnyLarry's scared him off, I suppose.
What did you hear of ColmSonnyLarry?
Didn't you and he used to be the best of friends?
We're still the best of friends.
No, you're not. Who says we're not?
She says.
Ah, for God's sake, Siobhan.
I said nothing of the like,
Mrs. McCormick! I was just chatting.
Now, you go off to Jonjo's, Padraic, and don't be getting under our feet.
Sure, Mrs. McCormick never gets a chance to come over for a chat.
She never gets a chance 'cause you avoid her.
I do not avoid her!
You hide behind walls if she's coming up the road.
I do not! h... hide behind walls.
Good luck to ye.
Daddy'll kill us if we wake him when he's been wanking.
You won't get into trouble for taking his poteen?
I will get into trouble, but fuck it.
I saw cannon-fire and rifle-fire on the mainland tonight.
Did you see it?
That'll be the Civil War.
I know that, sure.
Me, I pay no attention to wars. I'm agin 'em.
Wars and soap.
I tell you this much.
We're good at chatting, aren't we?
Me and you?
Your sister, does she like to chat?
Not as much as most women, but she'll chat, like.
She more likes reading.
Reading?
Feckin' hell.
Reading.
And did you ever see her with no clothes on?
I didn't.
Did you not, and you her brother?
Not even as a child?
I don't like to be chattin' about these types of things, Dominic!
What types of things?
Sisters with no clothes on!
You saw my daddy with no clothes on.
And till the day I die,
I'll wish I hadn't.
Sure, don't I know it.
The tiny, brown cock on him.
What's the matter with him?
Maybe bad news he's had?
Daddy?
No, ColmSonnyLarry.
Didn't I tell ya I'd be off if you went whining about that lummox one more time?
I tell ya, it didn't look like he had bad news tonight.
It looked like a weight was lifted from his shoulders tonight.
How's the book?
It's sad.
Sad?
Well, you should read a not sad one, Siobhan, else you might get sad.
Hmm.
Do you never get lonely, Padraic?
Never get what?
Lonely.
Do I never get lonely?
What's the matter with everybody?
Jesus.
"Lonely." Fecking hell.
Oh, so you're gonna be an eejit again today, is it?
Amn't I allowed to have a quiet pint on me own, Padraic?
Well, don't ask a man to call up to ya at your fecking house, so, like he has nothing better to do with his fecking time.
I didn't ask you to call up to me at me house.
And you do have nothing better to do with your fecking time.
Huh?
You do have nothing better to do with your fecking time.
I know I've nothing better to do with me fecking time, but there's better things I could be doing with me fecking time than to be calling up to ya at your house, Colm Doherty!
Like what?
Huh?
Like what else could you be doin'?
Reading.
Reading, yeah?
Me, this morning... this I wrote.
Tomorrow, I'll write the second part of it.
And the day after, I'll write the third part of it.
And by Wednesday, there'll be a new tune in the world, which wouldn't have been there if I'd spent the week listening to your bollocks,
Padraic Suilleabhain.
I was too harsh yesterday.
Yesterday, he says.
I know well you was too harsh yesterday.
And today.
I just, uh...
I just have this tremendous sense of time slippin' away on me, Padraic.
And I think I need to spend the time I have left thinking and composing.
Just trying not to listen to any more of the dull things that you have to say for yourself.
But I'm sorry about it.
I am, like.
Are you dying?
No, I'm not dying.
But then you've loads of time.
For chatting?
Aye.For aimless chatting?
Not for aimless chatting.
For good, normal chatting.
So, we'll keep aimlessly chatting and me life'll keep dwindling.
And in 12 years, I'll die with nothin' to show for it bar the chats I've had with a limited man, is that it?
I said, "Not aimless chatting."
I said, "Good, normal chatting."
The other night, two hours you spent talking to me about the things you found in your little donkey's shite that day.
Two hours, Padraic.
I timed it.
Well, it wasn't me little donkey's shite, was it?
It was me pony's shite, which shows how much you were listenin'.
None of it helps me, do you understand?
None of it helps me.
We'll just chat about somethin' else then.
Hey! What the hell's going on with you and me fecking brother?
Don't come in here shouting the odds at me in the middle of the fecking day, all right, Siobhan?
You can't just all of a sudden stop being friends with a fella!
Why can't I?
Why can't ya?
Because it isn't nice.
Do you want a sherry, Siobhan?
No!Righty-ho.
Has he said somethin' to ya when he was drunk?
No, I prefer him when he's drunk.
It's all the rest of the time
I have the problem with.
What's the fecking matter, then?
He's dull, Siobhan.
He's what?
He's dull.
But he's always been dull.
What's changed?
I've changed.
I just don't have a place for dullness in me life anymore.
But you live on an island off the coast of Ireland, Colm.
What the hell are you hoping for, like?
For a bit of peace, Siobhan.
That's all.
For a bit of peace in me heart, like.
You can understand that.
Can't ya?
Can't ya?
Do you think I'm dull?
No. 'Cause you're not dull, you're nice.
That's what I thought.
I mean, I'm a happy lad.
Or I was.
Till me best friend started acting the gilly-gooly.
It's him, Padraic.
Maybe he's just depressed.
That's what I was thinking, that he's depressed.
Well, if he is, he could at least keep it to himself, like.
You know, push it down, like the rest of us.
- No, Jenny!
- Out!
Out!
She just wants a bit of company, Siobhan.
Animals is for outside,
I've told ya.
And people don't be laughing at me behind me back, do they?
No. Why would they be?
They don't think I'm dim or anything?
Dim?
No.
You don't seem very sure about it.
Of course, I'm sure about it.
Dominic's the dim one on the island, isn't he?
He is, aye. By miles.
Uh, hang on, by miles.
And then, who's the next dimmest?
Well, I don't like to judge people in those terms now, do I?
In what terms?In order of their dimness.
Well, I know you don't.
And neither do I, do I?
But try, like.No!
I won't try.
There's enough judgy people on this fecking island, so no!
You're not dim!
You're a nice man, all right?
So, move on!
I'm as clever as you, anyways.
I know that at least.
Yeah, don't be fecking stupid.
