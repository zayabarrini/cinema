# Past Lives
- Hi, my love.
How was it?
You were right.
I was?
Yeah.
He came here to see me.
It's so crazy to see him be this grown-up man with a normal job and a normal life.
He's so Korean.
He still lives with his parents, which is really Korean.
And he has all these really Korean views about everything.
And I feel so not Korean when I'm with him.
But also, in some way, more Korean?
It's so weird.
I mean, I have Korean friends, but he's not, like, Korean-American.
He's Korean-Korean.
Is he attractive?
I think so.
He's really masculine in this way that I think is so Korean.
Are you attracted to him?
I don't think so.
I don't know, I mean... I don't think so.
He was just this kid in my head for such a long time.
And then he was just this image on my laptop.
And now he's a physical person.
It's really intense, but I don't think that that's attraction,
I think I just missed him a lot.
I think I miss Seoul.
Did he miss you?
I think he missed the 12-year-old crybaby he knew a long time ago.
- You were a crybaby?
- Yeah.
Most of the time he'd have to just stand there and watch me.
When is he leaving, again?
- The morning after tomorrow.
- Mm-hmm.
Are you mad?
No.
It feels like you are.
I don't have a right to be mad.
What do you mean? Of course you do.
No, I... That guy flew
13 hours to be here.
I'm not gonna tell you that you can't see him or something.
He's your childhood sweetheart.
And it's not like you're gonna run away with him.
Are you?
Definitely.
I'm gonna throw away my life here...
...and run away with him to Seoul.
Do you even know me?
I'm not gonna miss my rehearsals for some dude.
I know.
I know you.
What?
I was just thinking about what a good story this is.
- The story of Hae Sung and me?
- Yeah.
I just can't compete.
What do you mean?
Childhood sweethearts who reconnect 20 years later only to realize they were meant for each other.
- We're not meant for each other.
- I know.
I know.
In the story, I would be the evil white American husband standing in the way of destiny.
Shut up.
Well think about it?
Our story is just so boring.
We met at an artists' residency.
Slept together because we both happened to be single.
We realized we both live in New York, so, we moved in together to save money on rent.
We got married so you could get a green card. So...
- Oh, you make it sound so romantic.
- Right, that's what I'm saying.
I'm the guy you leave in the story when your ex-lover comes to take you away.
He's not my ex-lover.
What if you met somebody else at that residency?
What if there was another writer from New York who had also read all the same books you had, and watched all the same movies, who could give you useful notes on your plays, and listen to you complain about your rehearsals?
- That's not how life works.
- I know.
Yeah.
But wouldn't you be laying here with him?
This is my life, and I'm living it with you.
Are you happy with it?
Is this what you imagined for yourself when you left Seoul?
When I was a 12-year-old?
Yeah. Is this what you pictured for yourself?
Laying in bed in some... tiny apartment in the East Village with some Jewish guy who writes books?
Is that what your parents wanted for you?
You're asking me if you,
Arthur Zaturansky, are the answer to my family's immigrant dream?
- Yeah.
- Wow.
This is where I ended up.
This is where I'm supposed to be.
Okay.
What?
It's just that you make my life so much bigger.
And I'm wondering if I do the same thing for you.
You do.
I'm just a girl from Korea, you know.
And you're forgetting the part where I love you.
I don't forget that. I have trouble believing it sometimes.
Do you know you only speak in Korean when you talk in your sleep?
- I do?
- Yeah.
You never sleep-talk in English.
You only dream in Korean.
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.
You never told me that.
Well, sometimes I think it's cute.
Sometimes, I don't know,
I guess I get scared.
Scared of what?
You dream in a language that I can't understand.
It's like there's this whole place inside of you where I can't go.
I think that's why I've been trying to learn Korean, even though I know it's annoying for you.
You want to understand me when I'm dreaming?
Yeah.
I'm sure I'm just saying gibberish.
- Yi-yun
He's talking about you.
I'm sorry we speak alone.
Uh, we will stop.
It's okay.
You haven't seen each other in a long time.
I never thought I'd be a part of something like this.
Hm?
Sitting here with you.
Do you know what In-Yun?
Yeah. Nora told me about it when we first met.
You and me.
Yeah. Yeah, you and I are In-Yun too.
Right?
I'm really glad you came here.
It was the right thing to do.
Um, I'm gonna walk him to his Uber.
Okay.
Uh, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
Uh, come visit me in Korea.
Definitely.
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.
